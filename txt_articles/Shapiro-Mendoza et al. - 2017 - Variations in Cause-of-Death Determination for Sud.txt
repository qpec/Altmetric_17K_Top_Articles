OBJECTIVES: To quantify and describe variation in cause-of-death certification of sudden 
unexpected infant deaths (SUIDs) among US medical examiners and coroners.
METHODS: From January to November 2014, we conducted a nationally representative survey 
of US medical examiners and coroners who certify infant deaths. Two-stage unequal 
probability sampling with replacement was used. Medical examiners and coroners were 
asked to classify SUIDs based on hypothetical scenarios and to describe the evidence 
considered and investigative procedures used for cause-of-death determination. 
Frequencies and weighted percentages were calculated.
RESULTS: Of the 801 surveys mailed, 60% were returned, and 377 were deemed eligible and 
complete. Medical examiners and coroners classification of infant deaths varied by scenario. 
For 3 scenarios portraying potential airway obstruction and negative autopsy findings, 61% 
to 69% classified the death as suffocation/asphyxia. In the last scenario, which portrayed 
a healthy infant in a safe sleep environment with negative autopsy findings, medical 
examiners and coroners classified the death as sudden infant death syndrome (38%) and 
SUID (30%). Reliance on investigative procedures to determine cause varied, but 94% 
indicated using death scene investigations, 88% full autopsy, 85% toxicology analyses, and 
82% medical history review.
CONCLUSIONS: US medical examiners and coroners apply variable practices to classify and 
investigate SUID, and thus, they certify the same deaths differently. This variability 
influences surveillance and research, impacts true understanding of infant mortality 
causes, and inhibits our ability to accurately monitor and ultimately prevent future deaths. 
Findings may inform future strategies for promoting standardized practices for SUID 
classification.

Medical examiners and/or coroners 
(ME/Cs) rely on a comprehensive 
review of medical records, death 
scene investigation, and postmortem 
examination to determine cause of 
death for death certification.1 For 
infant deaths, a detailed description 
of the sleeping environment and 
evidence of airway obstruction are 
especially important to distinguish 
between sudden infant death 
syndrome (SIDS), accidental 
suffocation, and other causes that  
are not immediately apparent.1, 
 
2  
However, because these sudden 
unexpected infant deaths (SUID) 
often occur during sleep and 
are usually unwitnessed, a clear 
description of the circumstances 
surrounding death is not easily 
obtained. Moreover, although death 
investigation guidelines3– 
5 exist, the 
degree to which investigators follow 
these guidelines in a standardized 
manner is uncertain.6 Inconsistent 
reporting practices have implications 
for research and surveillance. 
Lack of standardized practices for 
investigation and cause-of-death 
determination result in inconsistent 
mortality estimates, which hinder 
accurate evaluation of temporal 
trends in mortality or changes 
in potentially hazardous factors. 
Because death certificate data are 
used to track state and national 
SUID trends, it is critical that death 
certificates be filled out accurately.
US mortality data from 1999 to 
2001 suggest that ME/Cs are 
classifying fewer SUID cases as 
SIDS in favor of other causes, such 
as unknown or unspecified causes 
and unintentional sleep-related 
suffocation (eg, asphyxiation from 
overlay, entrapment, or soft objects 
and loose bedding).7, 
 
8 Reasons for 
this diagnostic shift are not fully 
understood but likely reflect changes 
in diagnostic preferences, stricter 
adherence to SIDS definitions, 
and improved death scene 
investigations.8, 
 
9
We surveyed ME/Cs to increase our 
understanding about how death 
certifiers interpret investigation 
findings and report SUID. Our study 
objectives were as follows: (1) to 
describe and quantify variation 
in reporting by asking ME/Cs to 
classify SUID based on hypothetical 
case scenarios, (2) to describe and 
quantify the types of evidence used 
by death certifiers in determining 
cause of death for SUID, and (3) 
to determine the frequency of 
case investigation procedures 
used to make SUID cause-of-death 
determinations. Accurate estimates 
can result in improved availability 
and allocation of resources to 
develop effective interventions. 
Understanding cause-of-death 
determination practices could lead 
to improved knowledge about infant 
mortality causes, and it would help 
pediatric providers convey more 
reliable information about SUID 
causes and risk factors to parents and 
other infant caregivers.
MeThods
We conducted a cross-sectional 
study of US ME/Cs from January 
to November 2014. To obtain a 
nationally representative sample, 
we estimated that 2000 individuals 
certify infant deaths in the United 
States (R. Hanzlick, MD, Past 
President of the National Association 
of Medical Examiners, personal 
communication, 2013), and randomly 
selected a sample of 801 certifiers, 
or 40% of this group. The sampling 
approach used a 2-stage unequal 
probability design with replacement, 
with counties as the primary 
sampling units. In the first stage, 
counties were randomly selected up 
to 3 times from a list including all US 
counties and the District of Columbia. 
Each county’s probability of selection 
was proportional to the number of 
SUID in 2005–2009. SUID included 
infant deaths (<1 year old) with 
an underlying cause-of-death code 
R95 (SIDS), R99 (unknown cause), 
or W75 (accidental suffocation and 
strangulation in bed). In counties 
with zero SUID, the probability of 
selection was smaller than that for 
any county with 1 or more SUIDs and 
was proportional to the number of 
births in that county in 2005–2009. 
Contact information for ME/C offices 
was primarily obtained from the 
National Public Safety Information 
Bureau Database, purchased through 
SafetySource.com, and secondarily 
from Internet searches. From each 
selected county, a list of individuals 
responsible for certifying infant 
deaths was created by contacting the 
county or state offices. In the second 
sampling stage, individual certifiers 
were randomly selected from the 
list of certifiers for their county. 
Probability of selection was uniform 
within counties, and each individual 
could only be selected once (no 
replacement). One certifier was 
selected for counties selected into 
the sample once; 2 were selected for 
counties selected twice, and 3 were 
selected for counties selected 3 times. 
For counties in which infant deaths 
were certified at the state level, the 
state-level medical examiners were 
incorporated into the frame for that 
county. For counties with fewer ME/
Cs than the total sampled, we used a 
replacement protocol, which selected 
the next appropriate county in the 
order sampled.
Selected ME/Cs received a survey by 
mail and a $10 incentive. Two weeks 
after the initial mailing, a thank 
you/reminder postcard was sent to 
encourage survey completion and 
thank those who had completed the 
survey. Follow-up calls were made to 
individuals who did not return their 
survey. Altogether, 801 ME/Cs were 
invited to participate in the survey.
The survey included questions about 
ME/Cs’ demographic characteristics, 
hypothetical case scenarios, reporting 
practices, and knowledge and 
opinions about SUID (Supplemental 
Information). All questions and case

scenarios were written in consultation 
with a small team of ME/Cs. Scenarios 
were representative of actual SUID 
cases. The survey was pretested and 
modified based on feedback from a 
convenience sample of 9 ME/Cs. ME/Cs 
who pretested the survey, or who were 
consulted during survey development, 
were ineligible to participate.
ME/Cs were asked to complete the 
cause-of-death section of a death 
certificate for 4 different hypothetical 
infant death case scenarios 
(Supplemental Information). To 
quantify responses, we grouped 
reported causes of death into 9 major 
categories: SIDS, suffocation/asphyxia, 
SUID, undetermined/unknown, SIDS 
versus SUID, SIDS or SUID versus 
suffocation, explained (not suffocation), 
pending/defer to pathologist, and 
nonspecific causes (respiratory arrest). 
We considered the underlying cause 
of death first, but when the underlying 
cause was nonspecific (eg, respiratory 
arrest), other cause-of-death fields 
were considered.
To understand the decision-making 
practices used when determining 
cause of death as suffocation, 
overlay, wedging, and neck 
compression or hanging, ME/Cs 
were asked, “Which evidence or 
factors might cause you to make a 
cause-of-death determination of …
[suffocation, overlay, wedging, and 
neck compression or hanging]” 
(Supplemental Information).
To understand interpretation and 
reporting practices, participants were 
asked, “To make a determination of 
cause of death for sudden unexpected 
and unexplained infant deaths in 
your jurisdiction(s), how frequently 
are each of the following procedures 
used?” (Supplemental Information). 
For each listed procedure, possible 
responses were “completed routinely, 
”  
“completed on a case-by-case basis, 
” 
“never completed, 
” or “not sure.”
Survey responses were weighted in 
a multistep process to make analyses 
representative of the US infant-death 
certifier population. First, a base 
weight was calculated using sampling 
probabilities for the county and for the 
respondent within the county. Next, 
weights were adjusted for nonresponse 
within 10 deciles of numbers of births 
per county over the 5-year period used 
to establish sampling probabilities. 
Because ME/Cs from counties with 
more births were more likely to 
respond to the survey, we adjusted 
weights to approximate a constant 
response rate across deciles. Next, the 
weights were poststratified so that 
respondents from counties with zero 
recorded infant deaths over the 5 years 
used for sampling probabilities would 
account for 3.6% of the weight in the 
survey. Those counties accounted 
for 3.6% of all US births during that 
5-year period. The remaining counties 
accounted for 96.4% of the weight in 
the survey. Finally, the weights were 
scaled to total 2000, the estimated 
number of professionals who certify US 
infant deaths.
Frequencies, weighted percentages, 
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
were calculated to describe the 
distribution of responses for all 
categorical variables. All 95% CIs 
for proportions accounted for the 
complex sample design by using 
analysis weights, a finite population 
correction, and limits calculated with 
the modified Wilson procedure.10 
Sampling was conducted with 
Stata version 12 and analyses were 
conducted with Stata version 14 
(StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX). 
This survey was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board of Battelle 
Memorial Institute.
ResulTs
Of the 801 surveys mailed, 483 
(60.3%) were returned and 377 
(47.1%) were deemed eligible and 
complete. Ineligible respondents 
were those who indicated they did 
not make manner and cause-of-death 
determinations (n = 46) or who 
refused to participate (n = 50). Surveys 
with extensive missing information 
or that were returned after the study 
deadline were excluded (n = 10).
Most ME/Cs were ≥50 years 
old and male (Table 1). Among 
medical examiners, 97% reported 
postgraduate study, whereas 3% 
reported having a 4-year college 
degree or less. Among coroners, 
32% reported postgraduate study, 
and another 21% reported having 
a 4-year college degree. Nearly 
47% of coroners reported having 
less than a 4-year college degree. 
Approximately one-third of the 
study population had more than 
15 years of experience as a ME/C 
and 59% reported working in a 
county coroner office. The size 
of the jurisdiction served varied, 
with 24% of ME/Cs serving small 
jurisdictions, 44% serving medium-
sized jurisdictions, 25% serving 
large jurisdictions, and 7% not 
responding.
The cause-of-death determinations for 
each case scenario are shown in Table 2.  
For scenarios 1 to 3, 64% to 77% of 
ME/Cs classified the cause of death  
as suffocation or asphyxia. Other 
cause-of-death classifications were 
reported <15% of the time. SIDS was 
rarely reported (<2%). For scenario 4,  
the most frequently reported 
classifications were SIDS (38%) 
and SUID (30%). Less than 1% used 
suffocation or asphyxia to describe 
this case scenario. When examined 
by educational attainment, patterns 
remained similar. However, for 
Scenario 4, approximately a quarter 
of ME/Cs with postgraduate study 
classified the case as undetermined/
unknown, whereas those with less 
education more frequently reported 
the case as no response or pending/
defer to the pathologist.
In a question unrelated to the 
scenarios regarding general 
practices, 50% (95% CI 39%–61%) 
reported using SIDS as a cause for 
death certification. Those who used 
the term SIDS reported a variety of 
definitions that included, but were

The type of evidence that certifiers 
indicated might lead them to make 
a cause-of-death determination of 
suffocation, overlay, wedging, and 
neck compression or hanging varied 
by cause (Table 3). For suffocation, 
the 3 most frequently reported 
types of evidence or factors in 
determining cause of death were 
a blanched lividity consistent with 
nose and mouth obstruction (81%), a 
statement that the infant’s nose and 
mouth were obstructed (78%), and 
the infant laying on pillows or soft 
bedding (74%). The 3 most frequently 
reported evidence or factors for 
making an overlay determination 
were a statement from the bed-
sharer that overlay occurred (81%), 
a lividity pattern consistent with 
reported circumstances (78%), and 
sharing a sleep surface (77%). For 
the determination of wedging as the 
cause of death, the infant body still 
in wedged position (88%), a lividity 
pattern consistent with reported 
circumstances (78%), and positive 
signs of asphyxia (71%) were the 3 
most frequently reported evidence 
or factors. Finally, for determination 
of neck compression or hanging as 
the cause of death, the infant body 
still in compress or hanged position 
(88%), ligature or other compression 
marks on neck (85%), and a lividity 
pattern consistent with reported 
circumstances (76%) were the factors 
or evidence most frequently selected.
Routine use of procedures to make 
cause-of-death determinations for 
SUIDs also varied (Table 4). Ninety-
four percent of ME/Cs selected 
routine completion of death scene 
investigations. More than 80% of ME/
Cs selected review of medical records, 
complete autopsy, and toxicology 
analyses as routine procedures they 
used to make a SUID determination. 
Metabolic screening was another 
commonly selected procedure done 
routinely or on a case-by-case basis 
(81% of the time). Radiology and 
histology were selected as being 
routinely completed ∼60% of the 
time. Genetic testing (7%) and genetic 
tests for cardiac channelopathies 
(6%) were among the procedures 
least often completed, and these 
procedures were never completed 
by approximately one-third of ME/Cs 
(30% and 36%, respectively). When 
examined by educational attainment, 
patterns remained similar (data not 
shown).

This national survey of ME/Cs 
increases our understanding of death 
certifiers’ processes for interpreting 
investigation findings and reporting 
SUID causes. Given 4 different 
SUID case scenarios, ME/Cs did not 
universally agree on how to classify 
these deaths. Important differences 
were not observed by education 
level. For 3 scenarios, approximately 
two-thirds to three-quarters of ME/
Cs agreed that either suffocation 
or asphyxia was the appropriate 
cause-of-death determination. In 
the last scenario, nearly all ME/Cs 
agreed that the cause of death was 
not suffocation or asphyxia, and 
deaths were reported by using 1 of 3 
terms: SIDS, SUID, and undetermined/
unknown. Findings from this scenario 
and a follow-up question revealed that 
ME/Cs do not universally use the term 
SIDS to classify unexplained infant 
deaths. Our analyses also indicated 
that certifiers do not consider the same 
types of evidence to classify deaths 
as suffocation, overlay, wedging, 
and neck compression or hanging. 
Finally, procedures routinely used to 
make a cause-of-death determination 
were highly consistent among survey 
respondents. It is encouraging 
that most ME/Cs reported using 
a combination of a death scene 
investigation, autopsy, and review 
of the medical record when making 
a cause-of-death determination for 
SUID, the 3 essential elements of a 
SUID investigation.1 It is important 
to note that the 4 scenarios did not 
have correct answers. The survey was 
designed to elicit and represent the 
full range of responses death certifiers

typically use for SUID. The variability 
in our results helps to demonstrate the 
importance of having a standardized 
process for certifying these deaths and 
the importance of getting certifiers to 
agree on a minimal set of criteria to 
define suffocation/asphyxia among 
infants.
Our finding that ME/Cs do not 
universally use SIDS as a cause-of-
death determination is consistent 
with other reports.6, 
 
13, 
 
14 Those who 
do designate SIDS as a cause of death 
apply a variety of definitions. Findings 
about the variation in procedures used 
to make cause-of-death determinations 
are consistent with a recent National 
Academy of Sciences (NAS) report.15 
The report, although not specific to 
SIDS, SUID, or infant deaths, reported 
variability in case investigation 
practices and concluded that 
inconsistent practices were because 
of a lack of standardized practices and 
training as well as the variety of US 
ME/C jurisdictional system types.
Our results differ from the Brooks 
and Gill16 study that examined the 
frequency of infectious disease testing 
among SUID investigations. In that 
study, >95% of ME/Cs reported 
routinely performing histology and 
>90% reported routinely performing 
viral studies (ie, culture or molecular 
diagnostics) for SUID. Differences 
in findings may relate to differences 
in study design and response rates. 
The Brooks and Gill16 study was 
restricted to US ME/C offices serving 
populations >300 000 people and had 
a 29% response rate.
Our study has several strengths, 
including a sampling design that 
represents ME/Cs from all US states 
and the District of Columbia, a large 
sample size (nearly 400), a sample 
representative of the underlying 
population of death certifiers with 
respect to the distribution of the 
SUID, and a sample representative of 
individual death certifier practices 
rather than office practices. 
Notwithstanding, we also recognize 
some limitations. First, the response 
rate was less than optimal, although 
better than other recent surveys of 
this population.16, 
 
17 More specifically, 
the response rate was lower when 
the certifier selected into the sample 
was a state-level medical examiner. 
However, given the variability in 
responses to questions, it is unlikely 
that nonresponse bias would 
change the interpretation of our 
findings. Also, the study population 
demographic composition is similar to 
the demographic composition of the 
general ME/C population that certifies 
infant deaths.6 A second limitation 
is that scenarios were hypothetical, 
and the reported responses may 
not reflect actual practices in 
real situations. Finally, response 
options about evidence and factors 
considered in making a cause-of-death 
determination may not have fully 
captured a death certifier’s decision-
making process. For example, some 
ME/Cs may attribute SIDS risk 
factors such as prone sleeping and 
bed-sharing as factors in the sleep 
environment that likely led to death 
by suffocation, even with limited 
scene evidence about these factors 
causing airway obstruction. However,

responses were based on a list of 
preselected options, and participants 
could choose “other” and specify 
other evidence or factors not listed.
It was outside the study’s scope 
to fully understand why reported 
responses were selected and what 
these responses meant to the death 
certifier. For example, when a 
participant selected positive signs of 
asphyxia as a type of evidence they 
considered when making a cause-of-
death determination, it is unknown if 
the certifier perceived this evidence 
as consistent with or diagnostic of a 
particular classification. We also do 
not know how participants defined 
positive signs of asphyxia, although 
in the first scenario they were told 
that ocular petechiae was an example 
of a positive sign. Understanding the 
decision-making process of the death 
certifier merits further study.
This survey allowed us to quantify 
the magnitude of variation in 
cause-of-death determination and 
investigation practices for SUID 
among ME/Cs. Findings highlight 
the lack of a uniformly applied 
and systematic approach to cause-
of-death determination despite 
repeated calls for such.2, 
 
15 Death 
certifiers need to develop mutually 
acceptable criteria and definitions to 
make cause-of-death determinations 
reliably and accurately, especially to 
differentiate suffocation and asphyxia 
from other SUID causes.18 
– 
21 The 
NAS report highlights several factors 
that negatively impact progress 
toward developing and disseminating 
standardized best practices related to 
medicolegal investigation, including 
variation in medicolegal death 
investigation systems, unequal levels 
of expertise, and lack of resources 
for medicolegal professionals (eg, 
facilities, equipment, staff, and 
training).15 Until we address these 
limitations, accurate and reliable 
cause-of-death determination for 
SUID will remain a challenge.
Several promising strategies, if 
implemented, could address the 
limitations and improve practices. 
First, the accreditation processes for 
the National Association of Medical 
Examiners and the International 
Association of Coroners and Medical 
Examiners could place greater 
emphasis on standardizing the 
review of SUID. Second, per NAS 
recommendations, the number of 
board-certified forensic pathologists 
who determine cause of death could 
be increased. Although coroners often 
refer cases to forensic pathologists for 
autopsy, there are no built-in measures 
to ensure that the cause-of-death 
determinations by the pathologist 
align with the final death certification 
cause reported by the coroner. Third, 
medicolegal offices could hire and 
train more certified medicolegal death 
investigators. On June 21, 2016, the 
National Commission on Forensic 
Science voted unanimously to adopt 
recommendations requiring all 
medicolegal death investigators be 
certified by 2020.
Variability in cause-of-death 
determination practices influences 
how SUID are ultimately reported 
and classified for surveillance and 
research purposes. This variability 
negatively impacts our knowledge of 
the causes of infant mortality as well 
as our ability to monitor and prevent 
future deaths effectively. Findings 
from this study may inform future 
strategies promoting standardized 
practices for medicolegal cause-of-
death determination, especially for 
SUID.
