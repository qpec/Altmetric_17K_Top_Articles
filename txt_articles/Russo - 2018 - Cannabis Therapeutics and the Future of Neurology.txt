Neurological therapeutics have been hampered by its inability to advance beyond
symptomatic treatment of neurodegenerative disorders into the realm of actual
palliation, arrest or reversal of the attendant pathological processes. While cannabis-
based medicines have demonstrated safety, efficacy and consistency sufficient
for regulatory approval in spasticity in multiple sclerosis (MS), and in Dravet
and Lennox-Gastaut Syndromes (LGS), many therapeutic challenges remain. This
review
will
examine
the
intriguing
promise
that
recent
discoveries
regarding
cannabis-based medicines offer to neurological therapeutics by incorporating the
neutral phytocannabinoids tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), their acidic
precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), and
cannabis terpenoids in the putative treatment of five syndromes, currently labeled
recalcitrant to therapeutic success, and wherein improved pharmacological intervention
is required: intractable epilepsy, brain tumors, Parkinson disease (PD), Alzheimer
disease (AD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI)/chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).
Current basic science and clinical investigations support the safety and efficacy of
such interventions in treatment of these currently intractable conditions, that in some
cases share pathological processes, and the plausibility of interventions that harness
endocannabinoid mechanisms, whether mediated via direct activity on CB1 and CB2
(tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, caryophyllene), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-
gamma (PPARγ; THCA), 5-HT1A (CBD, CBDA) or even nutritional approaches utilizing
prebiotics and probiotics. The inherent polypharmaceutical properties of cannabis
botanicals offer distinct advantages over the current single-target pharmaceutical model
and portend to revolutionize neurological treatment into a new reality of effective
interventional and even preventative treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Cannabis burst across the Western medicine horizon after its introduction by William
O’Shaughnessy in 1838 (O’Shaughnessy, 1838–1840; Russo, 2017b), who described remarkable
successes in treating epilepsy, rheumatic pains, and even universally fatal tetanus with the ‘‘new’’
drug. Cannabis, or ‘‘Indian hemp,’’ was rapidly adopted by European physicians noting benefits
on migraine by Clendinning in England (Clendinning, 1843; Russo, 2001) and neuropathic
pain, including trigeminal neuralgia by Donovan in Ireland (Donovan, 1845; Russo, 2017b).
These developments did not escape notice of the giants of neurology on both sides of the
Atlantic, who similarly adopted its use in these indications: Silas Weir Mitchell, Seguin, Gowers
and Osler (Mitchell, 1874; Seguin, 1877; Gowers, 1888; Osler and McCrae, 1915). While

medicinal cannabis suffered a period of obscurity and quiescence,
mainly attributable to quality control issues and political barriers,
modern data on migraine (Russo, 2004, 2016b; Rhyne et al., 2016)
and neuropathic pain, whether central or peripheral support
its common application by affected patients (Rog et al., 2005;
Nurmikko et al., 2007; Russo and Hohmann, 2013; Serpell
et al., 2014), additionally supported by the National Academies
of Science, Engineering and Medicine (National Academies of
Sciences Engineering and Medicine (U.S.). Committee on the
Health Effects of Marijuana: An Evidence Review and Research
Agenda, 2017).
It has been noted for some time that muscle tone on the
central level is mediated by the endocannabinoid system (Baker
et al., 2003), but some additional years were necessary to
bring this ‘‘aspirin of the 21st century’’ through Phase I–III
Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs; Novotna et al., 2011) and
post-marketing assessment to demonstrate its safety, efficacy
and consistency (Rekand, 2014; Fife et al., 2015; Maccarrone
et al., 2017). That preparation, nabiximols (US Adopted
Name; Sativex�) has currently attained regulatory approval in
30 countries for spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis
(MS), and in Canada for central neuropathic pain in MS (Rog
et al., 2005), and for opioid-resistant cancer pain (Johnson
et al., 2010). Recent surveys find usage rates for cannabis
of 20%–60% among MS patients (Rudroff and Honce, 2017).
An earlier attempt to demonstrate neuroprotection in head
trauma after intravenous administration of single doses of the
non-intoxicating cannabinoid analog, dexanabinol, failed (Maas
et al., 2006), but hope remains for other preparations in stroke
and other brain insults (Latorre and Schmidt, 2015; Russo,
2015; Pacher et al., 2018). Table 1 summarizes the current
status of cannabis-based drugs in neurological conditions not
discussed at length herein, including sleep disturbance (Russo
et al., 2007; Babson et al., 2017), glaucoma (Merritt et al.,
1980), lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS; Brady et al.,
2004; Kavia et al., 2010), social anxiety (Bergamaschi et al.,
2011), Tourette syndrome (Müller-Vahl et al., 2002, 2003) and
schizophrenia (Leweke et al., 2012; McGuire et al., 2018). This
Perspective article will rather focus on several neurological
syndromes that overlap in their pathophysiology or have yet to
receive concerted attention in clinical trials of cannabis-based
medicines.
This author has previously addressed the pathophysiology
of migraine (Sarchielli et al., 2007), post-traumatic stress (Hill
et al., 2013), Parkinson disease (PD; Pisani et al., 2005) and
other conditions as putative clinical endocannabinoid deficiency
disorders wherein disturbances in endocannabinoid tone have
been demonstrated objectively (Russo, 2004, 2016b).
Various
synthetic
fatty
acid
amidohydrolase
(FAAH)
inhibitors have been investigated for neurological therapeutics
(Nozaki et al., 2015), but none have advanced to Phase III clinical
trials. This is a mechanism of action seemingly shared with
cannabidiol (Bisogno et al., 2001).
CANNABIS AND EPILEPSY
After elucidation of phytocannabinoid structures in the 1960s,
their pharmacology was slowly revealed (reviewed by Cascio and
Pertwee, 2014; Pertwee and Cascio, 2014; Russo and Marcu, 2017;
Figure 1). Various components were tested for anticonvulsant
activities with findings of ED50 in mice of 80 mg/kg for
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), 120 mg/kg for cannabidiol (CBD)
and 200 mg/kg for tetrahydrocannabinolic acid A (THCA-A),
the carboxylic acid precursor to THC found in raw cannabis
flowers (Karler and Turkanis, 1979). Although dose-response
was tested, it is unclear that very low doses were assessed and
given the biphasic tendencies of cannabinoids, it is possible that
positive lower dose effects may have remained unnoticed. CBD
was considered an excellent candidate for development based on
its lack of untoward psychoactive sequelae. However, little work
was done until a series of small human trials in Brazil in following
decades (reviewed by Russo, 2017a).
Subsequent
investigation
demonstrated
that
seizure
threshold is mediated by the endocannabinoid system (Wallace
et al., 2003), and that THC produced a 100% reduction in
seizures, whereas phenobarbital and diphenylhydantoin did
not. Additionally, animal studies demonstrated both acute
increases in endocannabinoid production and a long-term up-
regulation of CB1 production as apparent compensatory effects
counteracting glutamate excitotoxicity, and that anticonvulsant
effect was present at sub-sedating levels.
Sporadic case reports of successful utilization of THC in
seizures associated with severe neurological conditions in
children in Germany followed (Lorenz, 2004; Gottschling, 2011),

but
the
prime
focus
returned
to
CBD
due
to
strong
anticonvulsant
results
in
laboratory
investigation
(Jones
et al., 2010), which led directly to a pharmaceutical development
program. The lay public quickly became aware of these
developments, with promotion of the concept by Project CBD1
and publicity associated with the case of Charlotte Figi and
significant improvement in seizures associated with Dravet
syndrome, as portrayed on the Weeds documentary on Cable
News Network (Maa and Figi, 2014). Positive survey results
(Porter and Jacobson, 2013) were tempered, however, by studies
suggesting strong ascertainment bias in parental reporting of
seizure frequency: response rate for families moving to the state
of Colorado for cannabidiol treatment was 47% vs. only 22%
for those already living there, and were three-fold higher for
those reporting >50% response (Press et al., 2015). More careful
observational studies with a standardized cannabidiol oral extract
with THC removed (Epidiolex�) provided more compelling
results (Devinsky et al., 2016) with a 55% median reduction in
seizures in Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) patients
at high dose. Subsequent Phase III results in Dravet syndrome
at CBD 20 mg/kg/d showed strong statistical significance in
seizure frequency and Caregiver Global Impression of Change
(Devinsky et al., 2017). More recent studies have bolstered
evidence for safety and efficacy of the preparation in both
conditions (Devinsky et al., 2018; Thiele et al., 2018). As a result,
it received US Food and Drug Administration approval in June
2018.
Interestingly, extensive observations from other practitioners
(Russo et al., 2015) seemed to indicate similar therapeutic
1https://www.projectcbd.org/
successes with much lower doses of CBD when utilized in
cannabis-based preparations with small concomitant amounts of
THC, THCA and linalool, a terpenoid component of cannabis
(Russo, 2017a; Sulak et al., 2017; Pamplona et al., 2018).
Selective cannabis breeding via Mendelian techniques raises the
possibility of producing chemovars with multiple anticonvulsant
components that may produce synergistic benefits (Lewis et al.,
2018). THCA is an intriguing issue, in that there is debate about
whether it harbors CB1 activity, or rather is due to spontaneous
decarboxylation to THC (McPartland et al., 2017; Figure 1).
Cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) was also recently reported to
demonstrate anticonvulsant activity (Bonni Goldstein, personal
communication), possibly attributable to its serotonergic activity
(Bagdy et al., 2007), in that CBDA demonstrates 100-fold greater
affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor (Bolognini et al., 2013) as
compared to CBD (Russo et al., 2005).
CANNABIS AND BRAIN TUMORS
Strong
scientific
evidence
of
cytotoxic
benefit
of
phytocannabinoids has been available since 1975 (Munson
et al., 1975) and highlighted three decades later (Ligresti et al.,
2006), but the historical record suggests ancient use by Egyptian
Copts (THC and/or THCA; Reymond, 1976; Russo, 2007) with
similar claims by Renaissance herbalists in Europe (CBD and/or
CBDA; Russo, 2007). Brain tumors are the subject of an excellent
current review (Dumitru et al., 2018). To summarize available
research, specific pro-apoptotic activity of THC in C6 glioma
was reported (Sánchez et al., 1998), and shrinkage of in situ
human glioma cell line tumors was observed with CBD (Massi
et al., 2004). Intra-tumoral THC administration in glioblastoma

multiforme (GBM) produced slight life prolongation over
expectations in nine human patients (Guzmán et al., 2006).
Case reports from Canada documented total regression of
residua in two pilocytic astrocytomata in children after smoked
cannabis (Foroughi et al., 2011). Careful laboratory analysis
has established synergistic benefits of combinations of THC,
CBD and standard chemotherapy with temozolomide on glioma
(Torres et al., 2011). Clinical application of the concept has
been reported online in a Phase II randomized controlled trial
(RCT) of 21 patients with recurrent GBM on temozolomide plus
nabiximols up to 12 sprays per day (32.4 mg THC plus 30 mg
CBD plus terpenoids) vs. placebo with an 83% 1-year survival vs.
53% in controls (p = 0.042) and survival exceeding 550 days vs.
369 for controls, and only two withdrawals in each group due to
adverse events (AEs)2.
Such encouraging results are supplemented by a recent report
that THCA is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-
gamma (PPARγ) agonist (IC50 = 470 nM, Ki = 209 nM) >
CBGA (517.7 nM) and � than CBDA, CBD or THC (Nadal
et al., 2017). THCA improved neuronal viability in an animal
model of Huntington disease (HD), and decreased striatal
neurodegeneration (blocked by PPARγ antagonist), and it was
suggested as a therapeutic agent in HD. This finding, however,
has much larger implications and could explain claims of
therapeutic efficacy in epilepsy noted above (Sun et al., 2008),
as well tumors, and perhaps even in major depression (Colle
et al., 2017a,b). In contrast to other neutral cannabinoids and
terpenoids, THCA is reported not to cross the blood-brain
barrier (BBB), but if true, that hindrance may not be applicable
in the context of chronic epilepsy (Oby and Janigro, 2006), or in
brain tumors wherein that barrier is compromised.
As reviewed (Elrod and Sun, 2008), PPARs are ligand-
binding transcription factors on nuclear membranes that affect
adipogenesis, apoptosis and many other functions. PPARγ
stimulation may kill cancer cells without toxicity to normal
cells, such as astrocytes, and their effects are additive with other
cytotoxic agents. Butyrate and capsaicin may be natural ligands.
PPARγ has been identified in many cancers including those
affecting the brain, where it regulates target gene transcription
(Shen et al., 2016), and its activation inhibits tumor cell growth.
These authors suggested that PPARγ agonist may prove useful
in treating brain tumors, and may extend as well to ‘‘benign’’
lesions, such as meningioma, wherein pioglitazone demonstrated
activity (Gehring et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2016).
Thus, a Type II cannabis preparation, with equal THC and
CBD concentration, combining THC, CBD, THCA and even
CBDA along with cytotoxic terpenoids such as limonene may
prove extremely useful in cancer treatment (Lewis et al., 2018).
CANNABIS AND PARKINSON DISEASE
(PD)
As early as 1888, Gowers noted benefits of ‘‘Indian hemp’’
on a parkinsonian syndrome (Gowers, 1888; Russo, 2007).
Because of the density of cannabinoid receptors in basal
2www.gwpharm.com
ganglia, PD has been an area of active research, but with
mixed results therapeutically. An oral THC:CBD extract
showed no significant benefits on dyskinesia or other signs
in 17 patients (Carroll et al., 2004), but CBD was helpful
in five PD patients with psychosis (Zuardi et al., 2009)
and
21
patients
with
more
general
symptoms
(Chagas
et al., 2014b) and more specifically on rapid eye movement
sleep disorder in four patients (Chagas et al., 2014a). An
observational study showed 22/28 patients tolerated smoked
cannabis (presumably THC-predominant) and showed acute
benefits on tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia (Lotan et al.,
2014). Five of nine patients using cannabis reported great
improvement, particularly on mood and sleep (Finseth et al.,
2015).
A carefully crafted survey of 339 Czech patients using oral
cannabis leaves reported significant alleviations of multiple
symptoms (Venderová et al., 2004), particularly those using
the treatment for three or more months, with improvement
in general function (p < 0.001), resting tremor (p < 0.01),
bradykinesia (p < 0.01), and rigidity (p < 0.01) with few side
effects.
Whereas PD is commonly attributed to cell loss in the
substantia nigra, with chronicity, widespread pathology is the
norm. In common with Alzheimer disease (AD), tau proteins
that regulate microtubule assembly, cytoskeletal integrity and
axonal transport in neurons develop neurofibrillary tangles (Lei
et al., 2010). Interestingly, nabiximols reduced such tangles in
parkin-null human tau-expressing mice with improvement in
dopamine metabolism, glial function and oxidative stress, as well
as reducing anxiety and self-injury (Casarejos et al., 2013).
CANNABIS AND ALZHEIMER
DISEASE (AD)
Recent reviews (Aso and Ferrer, 2014; Ahmed et al., 2015)
have
nicely
summarized
the
pathophysiology
of
AD:
a
neurodegenerative disease with senile plaques formed of
fibrillar β-amyloid (Aβ) from cleavage of the Aβ precursor
protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases and by presence of
neurofibrillary
tangles
composed
of
hyper-phosphorylated
and nitrated tau protein. The latter precedes Aβ deposition
in sporadic cases. Once the process begins, deterioration
is
inexorable.
Additional
pathology
includes
functional
mitochondrial defects, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and failure of enzymes
involved in energy production that, in turn, produces nerve cell
exhaustion. Eventually, synapses and dendritic branching fail,
with consequent progressive neuronal wastage. Dementia and
cognitive decline develop, and no treatment arrests the process.
Intervention must begin at an early preclinical stage to have
any hope of success. Endocannabinoid function modulates the
primary pathological processes of AD during the silent phase
of neurodegeneration: protein misfolding, neuroinflammation,
excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress.
CB2 levels increase in AD especially in microglia around
senile plaques, and its stimulation stimulates Aβ removal by
macrophages.

Cannabis Therapeutics and the Future of Neurology
The epidemiology of AD is fascinating (Mayeux and Stern,
2012). North America and Western Europe have highest
rates (6.4% and 5.4% at age 60), then Latin America (4.9%),
and China (4%; ascertainment bias vs. mirroring economic
development and Western diet?). Prevalence is lower for Africans
in homelands, as opposed to higher rates in the Western
European and American diaspora. Head trauma increases Aβ
deposition and neuronal tau expression, and diabetes, obesity,
trans-fats and head trauma all increase AD risk. Mediterranean
diet (increased monounsaturated olive oil, and omega-3 from
fish), education and physical activity reduce it.
No current pharmacotherapy is approved for agitation in AD.
Commonly used anti-psychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics
and hypnotics are often associated with increased mortality in
demented patients (Kales et al., 2007), with an FDA ‘‘Black Box
Warning.’’ Four acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are approved in
the USA to improve memory: galantamine, donepezil, tacrine
and rivastigmine. None show strong evidence of efficacy and are
of limited benefit on a temporary basis. Various NMDA receptor
antagonists in development have proven largely ineffective on
disease progression or have proven toxic. In contrast, treatment
with cannabinoids appears both more promising and benign.
As demonstrated in 1998 (Hampson et al., 1998), and the
subject of USA patent US09674028, CBD is a neuroprotective
antioxidant, more potent than ascorbate or tocopherol, that
works on the same NMDA target without attendant toxicity.
Subsequently (Iuvone et al., 2004), CBD inhibited Aβ plaque
formation, prevented ROS production and peroxidation of lipids
in PC12 cells exposed to Aβ, limited neuronal apoptosis from
caspase 3 reduction, and counteracted increases in intracellular
Ca++ from Aβ. In an in vivo model (Esposito et al., 2006),
CBD was anti-inflammatory via reduction in inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS) and IL-1β expression and release. It also
inhibited tau protein hyper-phosphorylation in Aβ-stimulated
PC12 neurons. Subsequently, it was shown that CBD’s MOA
seemed to be selectively mediated via PPARγ (Esposito et al.,
2011): dose dependently antagonizing pro-inflammatory NO,
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and IL-1β. That effect
was blocked by GW9662 (PPARγ antagonist), reducing reactive
gliosis via selective PPARγ-related NFκB inhibition. Both AEA
and CBD promoted neurogenesis after Aβ exposure.
In addition to its neuroprotective antioxidant effects (Iuvone
et al., 2004), THC competitively inhibited acetylcholinesterase,
increasing levels, and prevented Aβ aggregation via binding to
the enzyme in a critical region affecting amyloid production
(Eubanks et al., 2006).
On the clinical side, various trials of THC in AD have
produced positive results. In 1997 (Volicer et al., 1997), in
15 institutionalized dementia patients refusing nutrition, an
RCT 6-week crossover trial of THC (Marinol�) 2.5 mg twice
daily led to increased body-mass index (BMI), with decreased
Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) scores, improved
negative affect scores, and a notable carry-over effect when
THC was administered first. In 2006 (Walther et al., 2006), an
open-label 2-week study of five AD and one vascular dementia
patient taking THC 2.5 mg at 19:00 h showed benefit noted
on nocturnal motor activity, agitation, appetite, and irritability
with no AEs. A 2015 study (van den Elsen et al., 2015) failed,
however: an RCT in 50 demented patients with neuropsychiatric
symptoms received 1.5 mg THC vs. placebo thrice daily for
3 weeks with no benefit noted to THC. A total lack of AEs
indicated to the even the authors that the administered dosage
was inadequate and that higher doses might be required.
Initial trials of herbal cannabis for AD have begun
sporadically, with a more focused effort in a California nursing
home (Hergenrather, 2017). Patients were treated with a variety
of preparations: THC-predominant (2.5–30 mg/dose), CBD
predominant, and THCA, mainly in tinctures and confections.
Marked benefit was reported on neuroleptic drug sparing,
decreased agitation, increased appetite, aggression, sleep quality,
objective mood, nursing care demands, self-mutilation and pain
control.
Based on its pharmacology (Russo and Marcu, 2017),
cannabis components may provide myriad benefits on target
symptoms in this complex disorder:
• Agitation: THC, CBD, linalool
• Anxiety: CBD, THC (low dose), linalool
• Psychosis: CBD
• Insomnia/Restlessness: THC, linalool
• Anorexia: THC
• Aggression: THC, CBD, linalool
• Depression: THC, limonene, CBD
• Pain: THC, CBD
• Memory: alpha-pinene (Russo, 2011; Russo and Marcu, 2017)
+ THC
• Neuroprotection: CBD, THC
• Reduced Aβ plaque formation: THC, CBD, THCA
Thus, an extract of a Type II chemovar of cannabis (THC/CBD)
with a sufficient pinene fraction would seem to be an excellent
candidate for clinical trials (Lewis et al., 2018).
CANNABIS AND TRAUMATIC BRAIN
INJURY (TBI)/CHRONIC TRAUMATIC
ENCEPHALOPATHY (CTE)
The neuroprotective antioxidant effects of the cannabinoids
(Hampson et al., 1998) are particularly relevant in their
ability to counteract ‘‘glutamate excitoxicity,’’ which leads to
neuronal demise after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Anecdotally,
cannabis, particularly chemovars combining THC and CBD,
have been extremely helpful in treatment of chronic traumatic
encephalopathy (CTE) symptoms: headache, nausea, insomnia,
dizziness, agitation, substance abuse, and psychotic symptoms.
CTE, previously known as dementia pugilistica, or ‘‘punch-
drunk syndrome’’ has garnered a great deal of attention
due to its apparent frequency among long-term players of
American football but including victims of repetitive head
injury from causes as diverse as other contact sports, warfare
and even ‘‘heading’’ in soccer. A recent study (Mez et al.,
2017) showed 87% of autopsied American football players
demonstrated CTE with tau aggregates in neurons and
astrocytes, neurofibrillary tangles in superficial cortical layers

and hippocampus, α-synuclein and Aβ deposition. Microglia
were present early in the course, whose premonitory symptoms
include dementia, personality change, rage, and attention
problems. Ninety-six percent demonstrated a degenerative
course. Heretofore, this has been considered a post-mortem
pathological diagnosis, but two current studies support the
ability for pre-mortem identification. CCL11 protein is a
chemokine associated with cognitive decline and enhances
microglial production of ROS and excitotoxic cell death. CSF
examination in CTE patients were elevated compared to controls
and AD patients (p = 0.028), and correlated to years of football
played (p = 0.04; Cherry et al., 2017), indicating CCL11 may
be a premortem biomarker for the syndrome. Additionally,
PET imaging binding levels in a CTE patient before death
correlated with postmortem tau deposition (p = 0.02). The
greatest tau concentration was observed in parasagittal and
paraventricular cortical and brainstem areas (Omalu et al.,
2018), allowing pre-mortem diagnosis and distinction from
AD. Neuroprotective benefits of phytocannabinoids, particularly
CBD, further outlined below, provide support for trials of these
agents in post-traumatic syndrome and CTE prevention.
HUMAN NUTRITION, CANNABIS, THE
ECS, “ACNE OF THE BRAIN” AND THE
“GUT-SKIN-BRAIN AXIS”
Human
gut
harbors
100
trillion
micro-organisms
at
a
concentration of 1012 bacteria/ml, and exceeding the human
genome 100-fold (Musso et al., 2010). This is termed the
microbiome. Obese humans have lower Bacteroidetes and
higher Firmicutes counts. Recent review (Clarke et al., 2012;
Russo, 2016b) supports the efficacy of probiotics (supplemental
beneficial gut lactic acid bacteria) in treating irritable bowel
syndrome without AEs. Microbiota regulate 5-HT1A, BDNF and
NMDA expression (Sampson et al., 2016), and experimental
transplantation of the microbiome of Parkinson patients to mice
was demonstrated to increase their motor deficits, supporting
the finding of a pro-inflammatory dysbiosis (microbiome
imbalance) in that disorder (Keshavarzian et al., 2015).
Another recent review elucidates additional findings of
pertinence to the current discussion (He and Shi, 2017).
The combination of prebiotics (dietary fiber that serves as
bacterial feedstock, reviewed by Russo, 2016a), and deficient
in modern Western diets (Calame et al., 2008; Slavin, 2013)
and probiotics may be termed, ‘‘synbiotics.’’ Translocation of
bacterial fragments produces ‘‘metabolic endotoxemia’’ from
bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Probiotics may help control
PPARγ, ‘‘the master regulator of adipogenesis’’ and TNF-α
in inflammation. Additional research supports that prebiotic
galacto-oligosaccharides (as from beans) decrease TNF-α,
and interleukin production (He and Shi, 2017). GPR41 and
GPR43 are orphan receptors for short-chain fatty acids (SCFA)
that can increase release of 5-HT and other factors. Additionally,
prebiotics change microbiota to reduce adipogenesis and stabilize
the gut barrier. Furthermore, CB2 levels correlate to Lactobacillus
concentrations and negatively with potentially pathogenic
Clostridium species.
Other experiments relate the microbiome to the ECS. A

Cannabis Therapeutics and the Future of Neurology
oral administration to induce CNR2 (gene encoding the CB2
receptor) mRNA expression above that of resting human HT-29
epithelial cells (p < 0.01) was demonstrated. An enhancement
of morphine antinociceptive effect in rats (p < 0.001) was also
demonstrated which was inhibited by administration of the
CB2 antagonist, AM-630 (p < 0.001; Rousseaux et al., 2007).
Additionally, THC altered the microbiome balance in obese DIO
mice affecting the Firmicutes: Bacteroidetes ratio (p = 0.021).
Furthermore, THC prevented weight gain despite a high-fat diet
(Cluny et al., 2015). This explains, perhaps, how the stereotype of
the ‘‘skinny hippie’’ is more accurate than that of the lazy, obese
‘‘stoner.’’
Additional dietary factors include the function of bitter taste
receptors (Tepper et al., 2014), present not only on the tongue,
but in the gut, and hypothalamus (Herrera Moro Chao et al.,
2016), wherein interaction with ECS appetite mechanisms seem
to be operative.
Diet
is
also
a
key
factor
in
acne
vulgaris,
whose
pathophysiology and epidemiology are surprisingly relevant
to this discussion. Acne was not observed in Inuit populations
living a traditional lifestyle over 30 years, but became common
with adoption of a Western diet and lifestyle (Cordain et al.,
2002). Similarly, no acne was observed in Papua New Guinea
or Paraguay among traditional indigenous peoples. Neither
population demonstrated markers of insulin resistance, nor
leptin elevations. The author then suggests that in many
respects, the epidemiology of acne parallels that of AD. The
relationship becomes more salient in light of recent findings
(Emery et al., 2017) demonstrating that neuroinflammation is
a stimulus to AD development and is triggered by infectious
insults. Additionally, AD brains demonstrated 5–10× greater
bacterial loads, especially with Actinobacteria, particularly
Propionibacterium acnes, a gram-positive an aerobic resident
of skin, mouth and gut and pathological agent of acne. P.
acnes has been cultured from AD brains, can grow there, and
stimulate alpha synuclein fibrillar formation in PD, amyloid
fibrillization in AD, and biofilm formation, which is opposed by
cannabinoids, and cannabis terpenoids limonene, alpha-pinene
(Soni et al., 2015; Subramenium et al., 2015; Russo and Marcu,
2017).
An additional parallel pertains to the TRPV4 receptor
(Zhang et al., 2013). TRPV4 is expressed in cerebral endothelial
cells where it mediates Ca++ and influx acetylcholine-induced
dilation. Cerebral hypoperfusion with impaired vessel dilation is
a pathogenetic factor in AD. That function is impaired in a mouse
model of AD and is sensitive to oxidative stress from Aβ, which
is alleviated by antioxidants. The authors suggested TRPV4 as a
target for AD treatment.
Cannabidiol, in addition to its anti-inflammatory and
bacteriostatic effects, is a TRPV4 agonist that works as a
sebostatic agent in acne (Oláh et al., 2014), while cannabis
terpenoids limonene, linalool potently inhibited P. acnes and
consequent TNF-α production (Kim et al., 2008). Alpha-pinene
was also a potent inhibitor of the bacterium (Raman et al., 1995;
reviewed by Russo, 2011).
The importance of these relationships becomes apparent
as efforts are made to integrate disparate threads (Bowe and
Logan, 2011). Mental health impairment scores in acne patients
surprisingly exceed those with epilepsy and diabetes. Oral
probiotics regulate inflammatory cytokines in skin. Intestinal
microbiota, skin inflammation and psychiatric symptoms are
thus intertwined in a ‘‘gut-brain-skin axis.’’ The author posits
that acne-induced processes could also affect PD, AD and CTE
pathophysiology (Figure 2).
FUTURE TRENDS
It is the opinion of many that neurology is facing therapeutic
brick walls. The current single target receptor model of
pharmacotherapy
has
not
proven
universally
salutary
in
the
face
of
complex
neurodegenerative
diseases.
Rather,
reconsideration must be given to an older proven model
of botanical synergy that may enable polytherapy in single
preparations (Russo, 2011; Brodie et al., 2015; Russo and Marcu,
2017; Lewis et al., 2018). Such approaches, combined with
nutritional and lifestyle management may make neurology
a
more
preventative
and
therapeutic
specialty,
rather
than merely diagnostic, and provide better treatment for
epilepsy, tumors, AD, PD and TBI/CTE. Suggested strategies
include:
• Aerobic activity (Raichlen et al., 2012; Schenkman et al., 2018)
• Education as a lifestyle
• Anti-inflammatory, prebiotic and probiotic diet emphasizing
saturated
and
monounsaturated
and
omega-3
EFAs,
bioflavonoids
(berries),
fermented
foods,
protein
and
minimizing carbohydrates (Fallon and Enig, 1999; Perlmutter
and Loberg, 2015)
• Supplementation with cannabis extracts providing THC, CBD,
THCA, CBDA, caryophyllene and other select terpenoids
(Figure 1; Russo and Marcu, 2017; Lewis et al., 2018).
Legitimate concerns surround the psychoactive sequelae of
THC, but as amply demonstrated by the nabiximols RCTs and
supported by mitigating effects of cannabidiol and cannabis
terpenoids (Russo, 2011; Russo and Marcu, 2017; Lewis et al.,
2018; MacCallum and Russo, 2018), cannabis-based drugs
portend to provide future safe and effective treatments for
heretofore recalcitrant neurological conditions.
