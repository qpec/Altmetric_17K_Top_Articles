Midlife exercise blood pressure, heart rate,
and fitness relate to brain volume
2 decades later
ABSTRACT
Objective: To determine whether poor cardiovascular (CV) fitness and exaggerated exercise blood
pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were associated with worse brain morphology in later life.
Methods: Framingham Offspring participants (n 5 1,094, 53.9% female) free from dementia and
CV disease (CVD) underwent an exercise treadmill test at a mean age of 40 6 9 years. A second
treadmill test and MRI scans of the brain were administered 2 decades later at mean age of 58 6
8 years.
Results: Poor CV fitness and greater diastolic BP and HR response to exercise at baseline were
associated with a smaller total cerebral brain volume (TCBV) almost 2 decades later (all p ,
0.05) in multivariable adjusted models; the effect of 1 SD lower fitness was equivalent to approx-
imately 1 additional year of brain aging in individuals free of CVD. In participants with prehyper-
tension or hypertension at baseline, exercise systolic BP was also associated with smaller TCBV
(p , 0.05).
Conclusion: Our results suggest that lower CV fitness and exaggerated exercise BP and HR
responses in middle-aged adults are associated with smaller brain volume nearly 2 decades later.
Promotion of midlife CV fitness may be an important step towards ensuring healthy brain aging.

Cardiovascular (CV) fitness is emerging as a factor associated with cognitive health in older
age.1,2 Cross-sectional and short-term (2-year) observational studies have demonstrated that
lower fitness levels are associated with increased brain atrophy in patients with Alzheimer dis-
ease.3,4 Similarly, healthy elderly individuals with low fitness have increased cerebral white
matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV).5 A recent study also reported that higher physical
fitness levels in middle-aged adults was associated with larger brain volumes 5 years later.6
Exercise training programs may increase cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery,7 improve
neuroplasticity, and prevent age-related brain atrophy over the short term,2,8 but it is not clear
whether physical fitness throughout adulthood has an impact on brain aging in later life.
Higher CV fitness may also reduce the impact of vascular risk factors9,10 that are associated
with brain structural abnormalities and cognitive decline.11,12 Poor CV fitness and vascular
dysfunction exaggerate fluctuations in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) during low-
level exercise.13–15 Therefore, the hemodynamic response to low-level exercise may unmask
underlying vascular dysfunction and poor CV fitness. Exaggerated exercise hemodynamics
has been associated with target organ damage16 in relation to CV disease (CVD),17 but the
association of midlife exercise hemodynamics and fitness with late-life brain structure has not

 been explored. The objective of the current
investigation was to determine whether mid-
life CV fitness and BP and HR responses to a
low-level exercise test were associated with
brain morphology in later life.
METHODS The Framingham Heart Study began in 1948 as a
prospective epidemiologic study of CVD.18 Offspring of the orig-
inal Framingham cohort (n 5 3,548) and spouses of those off-
spring (n 5 1,576) were recruited as part of the Framingham
Offspring Study.19 Offspring Study participants have had regular
clinical examinations approximately every 4 years. Between 1979
and 1983, at the second offspring examination (cycle 2), partic-
ipants completed an exercise treadmill test (ETT). Approximately
2 decades later (during 1998–2001), eligible attendees repeated
an abbreviated version of the ETT at cycle 7 and also completed
neuropsychological (NP) testing and MRI brain scans at a call-
back visit shortly thereafter (table e-1 on the Neurology® Web site
at Neurology.org).
Participants were excluded from the primary analysis (sample
1, described in figure e-1) if they had prevalent CVD, or had been
taking b-blockers at cycles 2 or 7 (n 5 304), or had clinical
dementia, stroke, or other neurologic conditions that could affect
the MRI/NP assessment (brain tumor, major head trauma, mul-
tiple sclerosis) at cycle 7 (n 5 32). Participants were additionally
excluded if they were unable to complete stage 2 of the ETT or
there were technical problems with the test (n 5 29) at either
cycle 2 or 7. Overall, 1,199 participants had NP data, whereas
1,094 had brain imaging information. Sample 2 (n 5 1583) was a
more inclusive sample, used as an attempt to limit the bias due to
excessive weighting toward healthier individuals. In sample 2,
participants were not excluded if they developed CVD or
began taking b-blockers after cycle 2 or had not completed the
cycle 7 ETT.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The study protocol was approved by the institutional
review board at the Boston University Medical Center, and all
participants gave written informed consent.
ETT at baseline (examination cycle 2). The first ETT was
performed using the modified Bruce protocol.20 Briefly, partic-
ipants warmed up on the treadmill for 6 minutes at 1.7 MPH and
0%–5% grade (stage 0 and ½ of the Bruce protocol). Each sub-
sequent stage lasted 3 minutes: stage 1 (1.7 MPH, 10% grade),
stage 2 (2.5 MPH, 12% grade), stage 3 (3.4 MPH, 14% grade),
stage 4 (4.2 MPH, 16% grade), and stage 5 (5 MPH, 18%
grade).
Participants
continued
exercising
until
exhaustion
(including chest or leg discomfort) or achievement of a target
HR based on 85% of age- and sex-predicted maximal HR.21
Other reasons for termination of the test included angina,
ischemic ST segment depression .2 mm, repetitive ventricular
ectopy, unexpected drop in systolic BP (SBP), or rise $250 mm
Hg. BP and HR recorded at rest and at the midpoint of stage 2
were used in the current analysis.
The following steps were completed in order to estimate
duration-based exercise capacity (DEC), based on the assumption
that HR increases linearly during the Bruce protocol.22 For par-
ticipants who reached their target HR (85% maximal predicted
HR), regression equations were created by plotting HR at each
stage of exercise. These equations were used to extrapolate the
duration of the treadmill test that could have been completed at
the estimated maximal HR for each individual (DEC). For par-
ticipants who terminated the treadmill test before achievement of
target HR, DEC was defined as the test duration, without extrap-
olation. DEC was then used in the following equation20 to cal-
culate estimated exercise capacity (i.e., peak VO2):

ETT during later life (19 years follow-up, examination
cycle 7). Approximately 19 years after the first ETT, the cycle
7 offspring evaluation included an abbreviated ETT. This pro-
tocol included a 1-minute warm-up, followed by stage 1 and 2
of the Bruce protocol, described above. Exercise was terminated
after completion of stage 2; therefore, estimated exercise
capacity
could
not
be
calculated
at
this
examination.
However, BP and HR measured at rest and at the midpoint
of stage 2 (analogous to that at examination cycle 2) were
used in our analyses.
Volumetric brain MRI outcomes. Brain MRI (3D T1-and
T2-weighted double spin-echo) was obtained on a Siemens
(Munich, Germany) 1.5 T scanner, in 4-mm contiguous slices
with repetition time 2,420 milliseconds, echo time 1 5 20
milliseconds/echo time 2 5 90 milliseconds, echo train 8
milliseconds, field of view 22 centimeters, matrix 182 3 256
interpolated to 256 3 256 with one excitation.23,24 Other MRI
parameters, descriptions of blinded image analysis, and definitions
of brain volumes have been published previously.23,24 Briefly, total
cerebral brain volume (TCBV) was corrected for differences in head
size by computing these variables as ratios with respect to total
cranial volume (QUANTA 6.2; Sun Microsystems Ultra 5
workstation, Santa Clara, CA). Age was regressed onto brain
volume and this relationship was used to estimate the number of
years of brain aging associated with specific fitness indices (0.2%
TCBV loss was noted per year of aging).12
Statistical analysis. We performed univariate analyses to
describe baseline characteristics in the sample of participants at
midlife (baseline, examination cycle 2: 1979–1983) and at later
life (examination cycle 7: 1998–2001) for all nonmissing data,
and then used paired t tests to compare the clinical characteristics
of participants between these time periods. Two primary analyses
were conducted for participants with no missing data. First,
multivariable-adjusted linear regressions were used to assess
relations between each of the CV fitness/exercise hemodynamic
(independent) variables at baseline and at follow-up, and our
primary dependent brain MRI measure (TCBV) at follow-up,
at examination cycle 7. We conducted these analyses in our
primary sample (sample 1), and also in a less restrictive sample
(sample 2, including participants who developed CVD or began
taking b-blockers in the interim between examination cycles 2
and 7, or did not participate in the treadmill test at examination
cycle 7). Models were adjusted for age, sex, and time between
examination cycle and MRI; model 2 was additionally adjusted
for the following covariates at time of ETT: smoking, diabetes,
APOE
e4
genotype
status,
and
use
of
antihypertensive
medication; and examination cycle 7 models were also adjusted
for serum homocysteine (levels were not available at examination
cycle 2). Second, a set of analyses was performed using interaction
terms to assess effect modification by sex, by hypertension status
at baseline (examination cycle 2), and by age at follow-up
(examination cycle 7) (,60 vs $60 years), and then stratifying
analyses by these subgroups if statistically significant interactions
were
observed.

 RESULTS At baseline, the average age was 40 years
(table 1). Prevalence of hypertension presented at
the Framingham Heart Study examinations increased
from 9% to 28% across the 19-year follow-up
period. By the time of examination cycle 7, 60%
of
participants
had
either
prehypertensive
or
hypertensive BP. Across the 2-decade observation
period, resting and exercise SBP increased, while
resting and exercise diastolic BP (DBP) decreased
slightly.
CV fitness at baseline (examination cycle 2) and brain
structure and function at follow-up (examination cycle 7).
In the baseline examination (cycle 2), 89% of partic-
ipants were able to achieve their target HR (85% of
predicted HR maximum) (table 1). The average par-
ticipant reached stage 4 of the exercise treadmill test,
with an estimated exercise capacity equivalent to 39
mL/kg/min. Lower estimated exercise capacity at
midlife was associated with smaller TCBV in later life
(table 2); an effect size of 1 SD lower exercise capacity
was equivalent to greater than 1 year of accelerated
brain aging. Additional analysis also showed stronger
relations between estimated exercise capacity and
TCBV in a less restrictive (sample 2) model (table
2); in this more inclusive study sample, an effect size
of 1 SD lower exercise capacity was equivalent to 2
years of brain aging. Lower estimated exercise capac-
ity was also associated with smaller frontal lobe vol-
ume in the minimally adjusted model (table e-2), but
was not associated with measures of cognitive func-
tion (table e-3).

and
follow-up
(examination cycles 2 and 7) and brain structure and
function at follow-up (examination cycle 7). Greater
baseline exercise DBP and HR responses were associ-
ated with smaller TCBV in later life in maximally
adjusted models (table 2); effect sizes of 1 SD higher
exercise DBP or HR were equivalent to approxi-
mately 1 year of brain aging. In contrast, higher base-
line
exercise
DBP
was
associated
with
better
performance on Trail Making Test Part B minus Part
A (Trails B 2 A) test in later life (table e-3).
Many statistically significant interactions were
observed among baseline CV fitness and exercise
hemodynamic variables and age, sex, and hyperten-
sion status in relation to TCBV (table 3). In partic-
ipants with either prehypertension or hypertension at
baseline, exercise SBP was associated with smaller
TCBV, even after adjusting for age, sex, and resting
SBP. In men, there was also an association between
baseline exercise SBP and TCBV. Baseline exercise
SBP and DBP were associated with TCBV only in
participants .60 years at follow-up; baseline exercise
HR and estimated exercise capacity were associated with
TCBV only in participants ,60 years at follow-up.
Greater baseline exercise HR response was associ-
ated with smaller frontal lobe volume in later life
(table e-2). Additional analysis also showed significant
relations between all of the exercise hemodynamic
variables and frontal lobe volume (and exercise DBP
with WMHV) in the less restrictive sample 2. In later
life, higher exercise HR was associated with smaller
TCBV and frontal lobe volume (table e-4). The asso-
ciations of later life exercise BP with TCBV or frontal
lobe volume were attenuated by adjustment for vascu-
lar risk factors.
DISCUSSION We describe an association of early
midlife CV fitness with later life brain volume in in-
dividuals free from CVD, stroke, or dementia. Poor
physical fitness in older age has previously been linked
to a greater WMHV and a lower parenchymal brain
volume in cross-sectional or short (#5 years)

 CV fitness (mean age 40 years) and BP and HR
responses to standardized exercise testing were
associated with reduced brain volumes almost 2
decades later. We also provide evidence that the
causal
pathway
linking
fitness
and
exercise
hemodynamics to brain morphology may be related
to the development of clinical CVD.
Evidence suggests that exercise, which improves
fitness levels, influences signaling pathways and the
neuroplasticity of the brain, reducing brain atrophy
and cognitive decline with age.26,27 These pathways
were not explored in the current investigation.
Instead, secondary analysis for this investigation
focused on the link between CV fitness and vascular
dysfunction. Hypertension and vascular stiffness are
risk factors for declining cognitive function12,28 and
have been cross-sectionally associated with larger
WMHV11,12,28–30 and smaller brain volume.11,31
However, resting measurements of BP and HR do
not adequately capture the range of dynamic changes
in these variables to which the brain is exposed, in
response to stressors (including exercise). It has been
postulated that the microvasculature of the brain is
particularly vulnerable to the excessive fluctuations in
BP,28 as a consequence of vascular dysfunction15 and
poor CV fitness.10
The current investigation revealed that higher
DBP response to a submaximal exercise test in midlife
was associated with smaller brain volume in later life.
This evidence complements previous studies support-
ing the association between exaggerated exercise BP
and target organ damage16,32 or CV events.17 These
findings should not be interpreted to suggest that
exercise is harmful; rather, exercise is the stress that
uncovers the vascular dysfunction likely resulting in
smaller brain volumes. In contrast, midlife resting BP
was not significantly associated with later life TCBV
in our cohort (data not shown), although this associ-
ation has been demonstrated in other cohorts.29,33
Individuals with exaggerated BP response to low lev-
els of exercise may have vascular dysfunction that may
not be discernable with examination of resting BP.15
There is also growing evidence that ambulatory BP is
more strongly associated with functional and struc-
tural brain impairments than resting BP measured in
a clinical setting.34,35
Exercise BP may be an early warning of changes in
vascular stiffness that only become evident in later
life.36 Our observed associations between early midlife
exercise BP and later life TCBV likely reflects the
importance of the duration of exposure to elevated
BP levels (which was close to 2 decades in this inves-
tigation). Further supportive evidence from our re-
sults indicate that later life exercise BP was not
associated with brain volume after adjustment for
covariates. Midlife hemodynamics may be more rep-
resentative of the hemodynamics to which the micro-
vasculature in the brain has been exposed over the life
course. Later
life hemodynamics
may also
be
impacted by a higher rate of concurrent comorbid-
ities, such as occult heart failure or weight loss, which
could result in pathologic lowering of BP, thereby
confounding the relations between BP and brain
aging.33
High HR response and low estimated exercise
capacity (both markers of poor fitness) were associ-
ated with smaller brain volume in models adjusting
for risk factors such as diabetes or smoking (which
is associated with lower exercise HR [data not shown]
and smaller brain volume12). Lack of adjustment for
potential negative confounders attenuates the appar-
ent effect of fitness on brain morphology. The current
investigation also suggests that certain subgroups may
have a stronger link between CV fitness, exercise
hemodynamics, and brain aging, including individu-
als at higher risk for developing CVD. In participants

 with baseline prehypertension/hypertension, the asso-
ciation between exercise SBP and brain volume was
stronger, reaching statistical significance. These re-
sults, although observational, suggest that improve-
ments in CV fitness, which lower the exercise BP
response, may be particularly beneficial for those with
prehypertension or hypertension. Pharmaceutical
treatment of hypertension in older age has failed to
show prevention of brain volume loss.37 But earlier
interventions to address modifiable risk factors are
becoming more attractive. While not yet studied on
a large scale, there is evidence to suggest that treat-
ment of BP in midlife may prevent cognitive decline
in later life.38
The strength of our investigation is the availability
of a midlife exercise test that was also repeated simi-
larly in later life (yielding 2 time points of evaluation)
in a large community-based sample of healthy adults,
free of CVD and dementia. However, due to this
design and potential loss to follow-up, our primary
dataset (sample 1) may be excessively weighted
towards healthier individuals. Strict exclusions were
necessary to reduce confounding by comorbidities,
but, as presented in sample 1, our results may only
be applicable to individuals with otherwise healthy
aging. Removal of the individuals at the highest risk
may have reduced the effect sizes and our sensitivity
to detect associations due to the strong reported rela-
tionship between CVD and brain structural abnor-
malities and cognitive decline. This hypothesis was
strengthened by our results in sample 2, demonstrat-
ing that our results were stronger in models that were
less restrictive (including participants who developed
CVD or began taking b-blockers).
Lack of associations in our investigation between
CV fitness and cognitive function may be explained
by an average age of only 58 years at the later life time
point. Detectable cognitive impairment can actually
take up to a decade longer than subtle structural brain
changes.39 On the other hand, despite investigating an
even younger cohort, a report from the Coronary
Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study
(CARDIA) study observed that physical fitness in early
adulthood (mean age 25 years) was associated with
cognition in later life (mean age 49 years).1 We are
unable to account for the differences between our re-
sults and the results from the CARDIA study, except
that different age groups and cognitive tests (list learn-
ing, digit-symbol, and Stroop) were examined; these
tests were not administered to Framingham partici-
pants. Our investigation did, however, uncover a
stronger relationship between lower CV fitness and
smaller brain volume in a subgroup of participants
,60 years old at examination cycle 7. Therefore, it
is conceivable that the effects of lower CV fitness
may be more discernible in early adulthood.

 Our findings warrant confirmation in future in-
vestigations. We did not account for multiple statisti-
cal testing; further, the largely homogenous racial
profile (white individuals of European ancestry) of
the Framingham Offspring Study decreases the gener-
alizability of our findings to other racial and ethnic
groups. Finally, brain MRI measures were only avail-
able in later life, thereby hampering our ability to
evaluate change in brain volumes over time (between
examinations 2 and 7).
Our investigation provides new evidence that lower
CV fitness and elevated exercise BP and HR responses
in early to midlife are associated with smaller brain vol-
umes nearly 2 decades later, thereby linking fitness over
the life course to brain health in later life.11 Promotion
of midlife CV fitness may be an important step towards
ensuring healthy brain aging in the population, espe-
cially in prehypertensive or hypertensive individuals.
