Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Current information on the prevalence and sociodemographic and clinical 
profiles of individuals in the general population with DSM-5 drug use disorder (DUD) is limited. 
Given the present societal and economic context in the United States and the new diagnostic 
system, up-to-date national information is needed from a single uniform data source.
OBJECTIVE—To present nationally representative findings on the prevalence, correlates, 
psychiatric comorbidity, disability, and treatment of DSM-5 DUD diagnoses overall and by 
severity level.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—In-person interviews were conducted with 36 
309 adults in the 2012–2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions–
III, a cross-sectional representative survey of the United States. The household response rate was 
72%; person-level response rate, 84%; and overall response rate, 60.1%. Data were collected April 
2012 through June 2013 and analyzed from February through March 2015.

 MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Twelve-month and lifetime DUD, based on 
amphetamine, cannabis, club drug, cocaine, hallucinogen, heroin, nonheroin opioid, sedative/
tranquilizer, and/or solvent/inhalant use disorders.
RESULTS—Prevalences of 12-month and lifetime DUD were 3.9% and 9.9%, respectively. Drug 
use disorder was generally greater among men, white and Native American individuals, younger 
and previously or never married adults, those with lower education and income, and those residing 
in the West. Significant associations were found between 12-month and lifetime DUD and other 
substance use disorders. Significant associations were also found between any 12-month DUD and 
major depressive disorder (odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95% CI, 1.09–1.64), dysthymia (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 
1.09–2.02), bipolar I (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.06–2.05), posttraumatic stress disorder (OR, 1.6; 95% 
CI, 1.27–2.10), and antisocial (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.11–1.75), borderline (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.41–
2.24), and schizotypal (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.18–1.87) personality disorders. Similar associations 
were found for any lifetime DUD with the exception that lifetime DUD was also associated with 
generalized anxiety disorder (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.06–1.49), panic disorder (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 
1.06–1.59), and social phobia (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.09–1.64). Twelve-month DUD was associated 
with significant disability, increasing with DUD severity. Among respondents with 12-month and 
lifetime DUD, only 13.5% and 24.6% received treatment, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—DSM-5 DUD is a common, highly comorbid, and 
disabling disorder that largely goes untreated in the United States. These findings indicate the need 
for additional studies to understand the broad relationships in more detail; estimate present-day 
economic costs of DUDs; investigate hypotheses regarding etiology, chronicity, and treatment use; 
and provide information to policy makers about allocation of resources for service delivery and 
research. Findings also indicate an urgent need to destigmatize DUD and educate the public, 
clinicians, and policy makers about its treatment to encourage affected individuals to obtain help.
Drug use disorders (DUDs) are associated with substantial burden through impairment in 
major life roles and increased risk for suicidality, neuropsychological deficits, diminished 
quality of life, and infectious disease (eg, human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis).1–7 
Drug use disorders also confer substantial burden on families, social networks, and society 
as a whole through violent and property crime, incarceration, poverty, and homelessness.4,8 
Changing societal factors in the last 15 years suggest changes in the distribution of DUDs in 
the general US adult population. These include public attitudes that have become 
increasingly permissive toward some types of drug use and legalization.9–12 Also, 
prescriptions for opioid analgesics and other psychoactive medications with addiction 
potential have increased greatly, with consequences such as drug overdoses.13–15 In addition, 
obtaining secure employment has become more difficult for many; unemployment is 
robustly associated with increased risk for DUDs.16 Using DSM-IV definitions of DUDs, 
national survey data indicate that prevalence may have increased. Comparisons of 12-month 
and lifetime DSM-IV DUD prevalence in the general adult population in 2001–2002 (2.0% 
and 10.3%, respectively)17 and 2012–2013 (4.1% and 15.6%, respectively)18,19 indicate that 
rates of 12-month DUDs more than doubled, while rates of lifetime DUDs increased by 
50%. With a wider segment of the population now affected by DUDs, up-to-date information 
is needed on other aspects of DUDs distribution in the general population, including 
sociodemographic correlates, associated comorbidity and disability, and treatment use.

 In addition, in 2013, a new diagnostic system, the DSM-5,20 replaced DSM-IV,21 which had 
been used to define mental disorders in epidemiologic studies for more than 20 years. 
Changes in the DSM-5 definitions of DUDs included a higher threshold to diagnose DUDs 
(2 criteria rather than 1), the addition of craving, a cannabis withdrawal criterion, and the 
severity metric based on criterion counts.22 While agreement between DSM-IV and DSM-5 
DUD was good, some nonoverlap occurred in case identification between the 2 nosologic 
systems,19 suggesting that assumptions about the distribution of DSM-5 DUD and its 
correlates in the general population could not be assumed a priori from older data based on 
DSM-IV. Further, opinions on appropriate severity indicators for substance use disorders 
have varied widely,23 suggesting the need to establish the utility of the new DSM-5 severity 
metric.
Considering the seriousness of DUDs and their consequences identified in previous studies, 
a pressing need exists for current, comprehensive, nationally representative data on the 
epidemiology of DUDs from a single uniform data source. Further, given the present societal 
and economic context, and the new diagnostic classification system, up-to-date national 
information is critically needed on DSM-5 DUD prevalence and associations with 
sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric comorbidity, disability, and treatment use. 
Such information is important for informing estimation of present-day economic and 
societal costs of DUDs, generating hypothesis-driven studies, and justifying the allocation of 
resources for service delivery and research. Accordingly, to our knowledge, this study 
reports the first nationally representative findings on the prevalence, sociodemographic 
correlates, psychiatric comorbidity, disability, and treatment of DSM-5 DUD, overall and by 
severity, from the 2012–2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related 
Conditions–III.24
Methods
Sample
The target population of NESARC-III comprised noninstitutionalized civilian US residents 
18 years and older of households and selected group quarters, as detailed elsewhere.24 
Respondents were selected through multistage probability sampling. Primary sampling units 
were counties or groups of contiguous counties; secondary sampling units, groups of 
Census-defined blocks; and tertiary sampling units, households within sampled secondary 
sampling units, from which eligible adult respondents were selected. Black, Asian, and 
Hispanic household members were assigned higher selection probabilities than nonminority 
individuals. Two respondents were selected from households (n = 1661) with 4 or more 
eligible minority adults. Data were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to represent the 
civilian US population based on the 2012 American Community Survey.25 These weighting 
adjustments compensated adequately for nonresponse.26 The total sample size was 36 309: 
the household response rate was 72%; person-level response rate, 84%; and overall response 
rate, 60.1%, comparable with other current US national surveys.27,28 Oral informed consent 
was electronically recorded and respondents received $90 for their survey participation. 
Protocols and informed consent procedures were approved by the institutional review boards 
of the National Institutes of Health and Westat (the contractor for the NESARC-III).

 Assessments
The diagnostic interview was the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 
Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule–5 (AUDADIS-5),29 
designed to measure specific DSM-5 DUDs, alcohol use disorder (AUD), nicotine use 
disorder (NUD), and selected mood, anxiety, trauma-related, and personality disorders 
(PDs). The 970 lay NESARC-III interviewers had an average of 5 years of field experience 
working on health-related and other surveys. Each interviewer completed a 1-day self-study 
and participated in a 4-day in-class training session on interview administration, study 
procedures, and confidentiality and security of NESARC-III data.
Drug Use Disorder
Drug use disorders included sedative/tranquilizer, cannabis, amphetamine, cocaine, 
nonheroin opioid, heroin, hallucinogen, club drug (eg, ecstasy, ketamine, and 3,4-
methylenedioxy-methamphetamine), and solvent/inhalant use disorders. Drug-specific 
diagnoses were aggregated to yield any past-year (PY) and any lifetime DUD. Consistent 
with DSM-5, lifetime DUD diagnoses required 2 or more of 11 criteria arising from use of 
the same substance in PY or prior to the past year (PPY). The PPY diagnoses required 
clustering of 2 or more criteria for the same drug in the same year. Also consistent with 
DSM-5, AUDADIS-5 DUD diagnoses were classified as mild (2–3 criteria), moderate (4–5 
criteria), or severe (≥6 criteria) based on the highest-severity substance-specific DUD with 
which a respondent was diagnosed as having during the time frame of interest. In this report, 
moderate and severe cases of DSM-5 DUD were combined to increase precision of the 
prevalence estimates and associations with other variables.
Test-retest reliability of DSM-5–specific DUD diagnoses (κ = 0.40–0.54) was fair, and of 
the associated dimensional criteria scales (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.45–
0.84) was fair to excellent in a large general population sample.30 Procedural validity was 
assessed using the semi-structured, clinician-administered Psychiatric Research Interview 
for Substance and Mental Disorders, DSM-5 version (PRISM-5)31 in a large general 
population sample. Concordances between AUDADIS-5 and PRISM-5 DUD diagnoses were 
generally fair to good (κ = 0.40–0.66) except for PPY hallucinogens and stimulants (κ = 
0.39–0.35); concordances between their dimensional criteria scales were excellent (ICC > 
0.68 except for PY sedatives and stimulants [ICC, 0.38 and 0.44, respectively]).32
Other Psychiatric Disorders
DSM-5 AUD and NUD diagnoses were derived similarly to those for DUDs. Test-retest 
reliabilities were fair to good (κ = 0.60–0.62) for AUD, fair to excellent for NUD (κ = 
0.50–0.87), and higher for their criteria scales (ICC = 0.83–0.85 for AUD and 0.83–0.84 for 
NUD).30 Concordances between AUDADIS-5 and PRISM-5 diagnoses and criteria scales 
were generally fair to good for AUD (κ = 0.42–0.62; ICC = 0.82–0.85) and NUD (κ = 
0.54–0.68; ICC = 0.80–0.84).32
Mood disorders included primary major depressive disorder, dysthymia, bipolar I, and 
bipolar II. Anxiety disorders included DSM-5 panic, agoraphobia, social and specific 
phobias, and generalized anxiety disorder. Consistent with DSM-5, primary AUDADIS-5

 mood and anxiety diagnoses excluded substance- and medical illness–induced disorders. In 
addition to mood and anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), eating 
disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder), and schizotypal, 
borderline, and antisocial PDs were assessed. Details on the psychometric properties of 
AUDADIS-5 psychiatric diagnoses are given elsewhere.30,33
Disability and Impairment
Current disability was measured using the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey version 2 
(SF-12v2), a reliable and valid measure widely used in population surveys.34 The SF-12v2 
scales included in this study were mental health, social functioning, role emotional 
functioning, and mental component summary. Each SF-12v2 norm-based disability score 
has a mean (SD) of 50 (10) and a range of 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating greater 
disability.
Statistical Analysis
Weighted means and percentages were computed for continuous and categorical correlates, 
respectively, of overall 12-month and lifetime DSM-5 DUD and by DUD severity level 
(mild and moderate to severe). Odds ratios (ORs) obtained from multivariable logistic 
regressions estimated associations between DUD and each sociodemographic characteristic, 
adjusted for all others. Logistic regressions of psychiatric comorbidity on DUD were 
adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and all other substance use and psychiatric 
disorders. These analyses examined unique relationships of DUD to other disorders that 
themselves have considerable comorbidity. Although eating disorders were too rare to assess 
comorbid associations with DUD, they were included as covariates in comorbidity analyses. 
Relationships of 12-month DUD to SF-12v2 scales were assessed using normal-theory 
regression, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and all other substance use and 
psychiatric disorders. All analyses used SUDAAN version 11.0 (Research Triangle 
Institute)35 to account for the complex sample design of NESARC-III.
Results
Prevalence, Onset, and Sociodemographic Correlates
Prevalences of 12-month and lifetime DSM-5 DUD were 3.9% and 9.9%, respectively 
(Table 1). Twelve-month prevalences of mild and moderate-to-severe DUD were 1.9% and 
2.0%, respectively; and lifetime prevalences, 3.4% and 6.6%, respectively. Mean (SE) age at 
DUD onset was 23.9 (0.23) years (mean [SE], mild: 25.7 [0.43]; moderate to severe: 23.0 
[0.24]). Twelve-month and lifetime prevalences of specific DUDs are shown in the eTable in 
the Supplement. The highest prevalences were found for cannabis, opioids, and cocaine, 
with lower prevalences for the remaining drugs. Rates were generally greater for men 
compared with women.
Table 1 and Table 2 show prevalences and ORs, respectively, of DSM-5 DUD by 
sociodemographic characteristics. The odds of 12-month and lifetime DUD across severity 
levels were generally greater among men, younger individuals, unmarried or previously 
married individuals, and those with high school or less education and lower income. The

 odds of DUD were lower among Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander individuals and 
respondents residing in the Midwest and South, regardless of time frame and severity level. 
The odds of lifetime DUD across severity levels were also lower among black individuals 
and those residing in the Northeast for mild 12-month and any lifetime DUD.
Comorbidity
Drug use disorder was highly associated with alcohol and nicotine use disorders, with ORs 
(95% CIs) ranging from 2.5 (2.00–3.06) to 4.4 (3.80–5.19) across time frames and severity 
levels (Table 3). Twelve-month DUD was also positively associated with major depressive 
disorder, bipolar I, posttraumatic stress disorder, and antisocial PD (any and moderate to 
severe); dysthymia (any and mild); and borderline and schizotypal PDs across severity 
levels. Lifetime DUD was associated with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety 
disorder (any and mild); bipolar I, dysthymia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and borderline 
and schizotypal PDs (except mild); and panic disorder, social phobia, and antisocial PD 
across severity levels.
Disability
After adjustment for sociodemographic and psychiatric covariates, respondents with 12-
month DUD had significantly lower mental health, social functioning, role emotional 
functioning, and mental component summary scores than those without. Disability increased 
with greater DUD severity (Table 4).
Treatment for Drug Use Disorder
Of respondents with 12-month and lifetime DSM-5 DUD, 13.5% and 24.6%, respectively, 
received any treatment (Table 5). The mean age at first treatment for DSM-5 DUD was 27.7 
years, nearly 4 years later than mean onset.
Among those with 12-month DUD, 8.2% received treatment from health professionals; 6.1% 
attended 12-step groups, and 3.6% and 3.2% attended outpatient or rehabilitation facilities, 
respectively. Other settings were used less frequently. Respondents with lifetime DUD 
showed similar treatment patterns except that rehabilitation programs (12.5%) were used 
more frequently than health care professionals (11.4%). Treatment patterns across 12-month 
and lifetime severity levels generally resembled those for overall DUD, although treatment 
was significantly greater in moderate-to-severe than in mild 12-month (19.5% vs 6.9%; 
; P < .001) and lifetime (32.5% vs 9.4%; 
; P < .001) DUD.
Discussion
In 2012–2013, the NESARC-III, a large national survey of US adults, assessed 12-month 
and lifetime disorders, including DUDs, diagnosed according to the new DSM-5. The 
NESARC-III used rigorous survey and field methods and incorporated measures of 
functioning and detailed assessments of treatment use. The NESARC-III results indicate that 
the prevalence rates of 12-month and lifetime DSM-5 DUD were 3.9% and 9.9%, 
respectively, representing approximately 9 131 250 and 23 310 135 US adults, respectively. 
Thus, a large number of US adults were affected by DUDs, as were an unmeasured

 additional number of individuals in the families and social networks of those with the 
disorder. Further, DSM-5 DUD was characterized by considerable psychiatric comorbidity 
and disability, thus indicating a serious condition. Associations with comorbidity and 
disability increased as the severity of DSM-5 DUD increased, indicating validity and utility 
for the DSM-5 DUD severity metric. Moreover, consistent with previous studies, DUDs 
largely went untreated, even among those with severe disorders, indicating that lack of 
treatment use continues to be a substantial problem.
Consistent with findings under previous diagnostic systems and those from the NESARC-III 
concerning DSM-5 AUD and NUD,18,26,36–38 rates of DUD were higher among men and 
inversely related to age. Additionally, ORs for associations of DUD with age were 
significantly greater for moderate-to-severe than mild lifetime DUD within age groups. 
Further prospective research is needed to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Nevertheless, 
both substantial associations in all 3 younger age groups, and significant differences in age-
specific lifetime ORs by DUD severity, reinforce the importance of continued and expanded 
age-appropriate prevention and treatment strategies across the lifespan.
Compared with non-Hispanic white individuals, Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic 
individuals exhibited lower risks across time frames and black individuals for lifetime DUD. 
Conversely, Native American individuals exhibited higher odds of moderate-to-severe 
lifetime DUD. However, even among minority groups with lower prevalences, culturally 
appropriate prevention efforts against both drug use and DUD and effective interventions 
when these occur are necessary. Risk factors among white and Native American individuals 
and protective factors among other minority groups should be further examined to expand 
understanding of DUD etiology and improve treatment and prevention approaches.
Also compatible with previous findings based on earlier diagnostic systems,18,26,39–42 after 
adjustment for sociodemographics and additional comorbidity, we observed significant, 
positive associations of 12-month and lifetime DUD with other SUDs and a broad range of 
mood, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and personality disorders. Stronger associations and 
significantly different ORs by DUD severity, particularly for lifetime comorbidity, with 
adjustment only for sociodemographic characteristics (data not shown), suggest that factors 
common to DUD and comorbid disorders partly explain both magnitudes and variations by 
DUD severity of the associations. However, persistence of significant relationships after 
adjustment for additional comorbidity suggests important unique contributory factors. These 
results, along with those of previous epidemiologic18,42 and genetic43–45 studies, warrant 
further study of etiologic factors underlying DUD comorbidity, including DUD severity.
As represented by the SF-12v2 scores, disability was significantly related to 12-month DUD 
even after adjustment for sociodemographic and diagnostic covariates. Disability was 
greatest in moderate-to-severe DUD. Together with findings on comorbidity, these results 
highlight the clinical significance of even mild DUD and suggest that treatment should 
continue to target functional impairment and drug-related symptoms.46,47
Even among moderate-to-severe cases, less than 20% of respondents with 12-month DUD 
and less than one-third with lifetime DUD received treatment or participated in self-help

 programs. These low prevalences of treatment may reflect continued skepticism, including 
concerns about the effectiveness and value of treatment, as well as persistent barriers related 
to stigma, insufficient resources within health care systems, and health care professionals’ 
lack of knowledge and skill regarding identification of potentially problematic drug 
use.23,47–50 Nonetheless, a large literature supports the efficacy of behavioral treatments for 
DUDs, including cognitive-behavioral, motivational enhancement, contingency 
management, and community reinforcement approaches.46,51–56 However, opioid use 
disorders are currently the only DUDs for which empirically supported pharmacotherapies 
are available, including methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone.46,51–56 The 
appropriateness of existing behavioral treatments for mild DUDs, medications for mild 
opioid use disorders, and medications under development to treat other DUDs across 
severity levels warrants examination. More work is needed to destigmatize DUDs and 
educate the public, including health care professionals, about recent advances in treatment 
and their effectiveness, as well as how and where to obtain help.51,52,57–59
The most common treatment health care professionals for individuals with DUDs included 
private health professionals, highlighting these clinicians’ key roles in identifying and 
linking affected individuals to appropriate help. In contrast to alcohol and tobacco, evidence 
is limited for the effectiveness of brief interventions in reducing drug use and problems 
among nonhelp-seeking individuals in primary care.53,54 Nevertheless, identifying and 
addressing drug use are essential components of good clinical practice for reasons including 
appropriate diagnosis of medical and psychiatric conditions, safe prescribing of medications, 
and enabling referrals to DUD treatment when indicated.53,55 The prevalence of DUD in this 
study underscores the need for continued efforts to develop and implement screening tools 
and protocols to refer individuals with DUDs to appropriate treatment.46,50,51
Study limitations included the cross-sectional design of the NESARC-III. Prospective 
investigations are needed to assess stability of the survey estimates over time. The exclusion 
of most institutionalized individuals, including those in jails and prisons, and active-duty 
military personnel may have led to underestimation of DUD prevalence in the NESARC-
III.60 Social desirability biases in responding may also have led to an underestimate of DUD 
prevalence61; however, we cannot identify obvious disincentives to accurate reporting, 
particularly given the strict confidentiality provisions of the NESARC-III. Prevalences of 
disorders comorbid with DUD based on the fully structured AUDADIS-5 may differ from 
those that are clinically derived and further study in this area is warranted. An additional 
consideration is that these results reflect the aggregation of drug-specific use disorders into 
diagnoses of any 12-month and any lifetime DUD, whereas sociodemographic correlates, 
comorbid associations, disability profiles, and patterns of treatment and help-seeking may 
differ by drug. The epidemiology of DUDs associated with several specific drugs in the 
NESARC-III is warranted.
The NESARC-III also had considerable strengths. It is the first survey of the epidemiology 
of DSM-5 DUD in US adults based on a large nationally representative sample using 
rigorous methods. Additional strengths included coverage of the full spectrum of common 
mental disorders, including mood, anxiety, and personality disorders, as well as a well-
validated measure of functioning. An additional strength that will be tapped in future

 research was the availability of genetic data from a large subsample of the NESARC-III 
sample. The present article lays important groundwork for future studies using the genetic 
data.
Conclusions
DSM-5 DUD is prevalent among US adults. The public is increasingly less likely to 
disapprove of specific types of drug use (eg, marijuana) or to see it as risky, and consistent 
with these attitudes, laws governing drug use are becoming more permissive. However, the 
present NESARC-III findings on disability and comorbidity indicate that DUDs as defined 
by the new DSM-5 nosology are serious conditions affecting many millions of Americans.
With these findings now available, studies can now begin to examine the broad relationships 
in more detail; estimate the present-day economic and societal costs of DUDs; investigate 
hypotheses about etiology, chronicity, and treatment use; and provide information to policy 
makers for decision making about the allocation of resources for service delivery and 
research. Study results also reinforce the urgency of destigmatizing DUD and educating the 
public, clinicians, and policy makers about its treatments, thus enabling more affected 
individuals to obtain help.
