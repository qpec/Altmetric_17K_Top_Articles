Abstract
Although various theories describe mechanisms leading to differential parenting of boys
and girls, there is no consensus about the extent to which parents do treat their sons and
daughters differently. The last meta-analyses on the subject were conducted more than fif-
teen years ago, and changes in gender-specific child rearing in the past decade are quite
plausible. In the current set of meta-analyses, based on 126 observational studies (15,034
families), we examined mothers’ and fathers’ differential use of autonomy-supportive and
controlling strategies with boys and girls, and the role of moderators related to the decade in
which the study was conducted, the observational context, and sample characteristics.
Databases of Web of Science, ERIC, PsychInfo, Online Contents, Picarta, and Proquest
were searched for studies examining differences in observed parental control of boys and
girls between the ages of 0 and 18 years. Few differences were found in parents’ use of con-
trol with boys and girls. Parents were slightly more controlling with boys than with girls, but
the effect size was negligible (d = 0.08). The effect was larger, but still small, in normative
groups and in samples with younger children. No overall effect for gender-differentiated
autonomy-supportive strategies was found (d = 0.03). A significant effect of time emerged:
studies published in the 1970s and 1980s reported more autonomy-supportive strategies
with boys than toward girls, but from 1990 onwards parents showed somewhat more auton-
omy-supportive strategies with girls than toward boys. Taking into account parents’ gender
stereotypes might uncover subgroups of families where gender-differentiated control is
salient, but based on our systematic review of the currently available large data base we
conclude that in general the differences between parenting of boys versus girls are minimal.
Introduction
One of the mechanisms proposed to explain gender differences in children’s behavior is that
parents treat boys and girls differently [1]. Several theoretical models suggest mechanisms that

 are consistent with the differential treatment of boys and girls, including biosocial theory [2],
[3], and gender schema theories [4], [5]. However, to date there is no consensus in the litera-
ture about the extent to which parents do treat their sons and daughters differently, in which
areas of parenting this mostly occurs, and whether fathers and mothers differ in the extent of
gender differentiation [6], [7], [8]. We conducted a series of meta-analyses to examine whether
parents use different control strategies with boys than with girls. We focused on observed
parental control, to minimize social desirable responding by parents and because differential
parenting occurs mostly at an unconscious level and is therefore more likely to be captured
using observation methods than with self-report measures [9].
Gender-Differentiated Control: Theoretical Perspectives
Self-determination theory.
Parental control strategies can be defined as any strategy that
a parent uses to alter, change, or influence their child’s behavior, thoughts, or feelings [10],
[11]. Self-determination theory [12] provides a framework for different types of parental
control that promote optimal or less optimal child development. Central to this theory is
the distinction between behaviors that a person willingly endorses (i.e., autonomously regu-
lated behavior) and behaviors that are enacted because of pressure from, for example, the
social environment (i.e., controlled behavior). Self-determination theory assumes that two
types of parental control play an important role in children’s development of autonomous or
controlled regulation of behavior [13], [14], i.e., autonomy-supportive and controlling strate-
gies [15].
Autonomy-supportive strategies provide the child with an appropriate amount of control, a
desired amount of choice, acknowledge the child’s perspectives, and provide the child with
meaningful rationales when choice is constrained [14]. These strategies are thought to foster
autonomous regulation and child well-being, because they adhere to children’s basic needs for
competence, relatedness, and autonomy [12]. Autonomy-supportive strategies are conceptually
similar to the construct of parental sensitivity as formulated within attachment theory, as sensi-
tivity is also concerned with child-centered responding and promoting autonomy through sup-
port [16], [17]. Examples of autonomy-supporting strategies are induction (i.e., providing
explanations for commands and prohibitions), empathy for the child (“I know this is difficult
for you”), approval, support, and encouragement (see [11], [18]). Meta-analyses have shown
that maternal and paternal autonomy-supportive strategies tend to be associated with lower
levels of child disruptive behaviors such as oppositional, aggressive, and hyperactive behaviors
[19], [20], [21]. Furthermore, a previous study has also shown that an intervention to promote
mothers’ use of autonomy-supportive strategies (i.e., sensitive discipline) was effective in
decreasing children’s disruptive (i.e., overactive) behavior [22].
Controlling strategies undermine the child’s ability for autonomous regulation, and press
the child to think, behave, or feel in particular ways [14], [15]. These strategies are thought to
foster controlled regulation and behavioral maladjustment, because they do not support chil-
dren’s basic needs for competence, relatedness, and autonomy [12]. Controlling strategies are
conceptually similar to the parenting practices described within coercion theory [23]. Coer-
cive parenting also refers to strategies that force rather than motivate a child to comply with-
out fostering the child’s autonomy. There are two ways in which parents can be controlling
[15], that is, via internal and external pressure. External pressure refers to harsh, explicit, or
tangible control, such as spanking, hitting, grabbing with force, or forcefully taking the child
out of the situation (i.e., harsh discipline/power assertion; [24]). Internal pressure refers to
parental behaviors that intrude upon the child’s psychological world (i.e., thoughts and feel-
ings) as a pressure to comply, and includes manipulative parenting techniques, such as guilt

 induction, shaming, criticism, invalidation of the child’s feelings, and love withdrawal (i.e.,
psychological control; [10]). There is ample empirical evidence that maternal and paternal
controlling behavior in general is related to an increase in disruptive behavior in children of
different ages (see meta-analyses [19], [25]). Moreover, both mothers’ and fathers’ use of psy-
chological control is associated with internalizing problems in children and adolescents [10],
[15], [26], [27], [28], and with girls’ relational aggression in middle childhood [29]. Mothers’
and fathers’ harsh physical discipline is more often associated with externalizing problems in
children [30] and adolescents [31].
Self-determination theory cannot be applied to the study of gender-differentiated parental
control as one of its fundamental assumptions is the universality of its psychological constructs
across gender. Therefore, in the current meta-analysis the hypotheses with regard to the direc-
tion of gender-differentiated control (i.e., used more with boys or girls) were guided by theoret-
ical frameworks addressing socialization and gender development, including biosocial theory
[2], [3], and gender schema theories (e.g., [4], [5]).
Biosocial theory.
Biosocial theory of sex differences provides rationales for differential
control of boys and girls [2], [3]. According to this theory, gender differences in social behavior
arise from societies’ division in gender roles, and particularly on the female role of homemaker
and the male role of economic provider. This division is still visible in present-day societies;
mothers are more likely to be the primary caregivers of young children [32], [33], females are
overrepresented in educational and nurturing occupations, and males are overrepresented in
occupations that are associated with power, physical strength, status, and agentic personality
characteristics (i.e., management, engineering) [34].
Biosocial theory proposes the following cycle in which gender roles and the characteristics
associated with these roles lead to beliefs and expectancies about the different nature and
behavior of men and women (i.e., gender stereotypes), which will lead to differential treatment
of men and women, and boys and girls [3]. Mothers and fathers are expected to use different
control strategies with boys than with girls in accordance with the gender roles defined in their
society. Parental control of girls would be characterized by kindness, consideration of others’
perspectives, empathy, and interpersonal closeness (e.g., using autonomy-supportive strate-
gies), whereas parental control of boys would be characterized by power, assertiveness, aggres-
siveness, and dominance (e.g., using controlling strategies). The link between gender roles and
the differential treatment of boys and girls by parents is reflected, for example, in the finding
that aggressiveness is promoted in boys, and not in girls, through harsh parenting practices in
societies at war [35]. Since women are less accepting than men of social hierarchies that subor-
dinate women [36], mothers may be less likely than fathers to socialize their children into soci-
eties’ gender roles using gender-differentiated parenting practices.
Gender schema theories.
It seems unlikely that all parents in a given society would use
gender-differentiated control strategies in accordance with the gender roles of that society.
According to gender schema theories [4] parents’ gender-differentiated use of controlling and
autonomy supportive strategies is likely to be influenced by parents’ gender-role stereotypes.
When parents have traditional attitudes about gender roles, they are more likely to show gen-
der-differentiated parenting that reinforces gender-role consistent behavior (e.g., more harsh
or physical control of boys than girls, more gentle control and guidance of girls than of boys).
When parents have counter-stereotypical ideas about the roles of males and females (i.e.,
female as economic provider, male as caretaker), they might be more likely to show gender-
differentiated parenting that reinforces behavior that is inconsistent with gender roles (e.g.,
more gentle control and guidance of boys than of girls, more harsh or physical control of girls
than of boys).

 Gender-Differentiated Parental Control: Previous Findings
There is some meta-analytic evidence that parents use different control strategies with boys
and girls, and that the extent to which this happens differs for fathers and mothers. For exam-
ple, Lytton and Romney [8] demonstrated in their meta-analysis that in Western countries
other than North America, parents use more physical punishment with boys than with girls.
They also found some evidence for fathers to differentiate more between boys and girls than
mothers. In their meta-analysis, Leaper and colleagues [7] found that mothers used more sup-
portive speech with daughters than with sons, with greater effects for older than younger chil-
dren. They also found a negligible effect for mothers’ use of directive speech (i.e., slightly more
with girls than with boys).
Both meta-analyses are cited broadly, but they were not without limitations [7], [37]. First,
both meta-analyses did not disentangle child gender effects on parenting from effects of tem-
perament or gender-specific behavioral differences, probably because too few studies included
pertinent data. Second, the Lytton and Romney meta-analysis [8] has been criticized for using
categories of socialization behaviors that were too broad [37], and combining constructs that
were too divergent. However, choosing a construct that is too specific harbors the risk of end-
ing up with only a few studies on fathers, as was the problem in the Leaper, Anderson, and
Sanders meta-analysis [7]. Third, both meta-analyses did not include psychological control. To
our knowledge the literature on psychological control has not yet been systematically reviewed
with regard to the differential use of psychological control with boys and girls.
Some recent observation studies have found similar results as the meta-analyses, with
parents using more sensitive or autonomy-supportive strategies with girls than with boys (e.g.,
[38], [39]) and more harsh or controlling strategies with boys than with girls (e.g., [39], [40]).
These findings indicate a tendency for controlling strategies (i.e., focused on dominance, nega-
tivity, and power) to be used preferably with boys, and autonomy-supportive strategies (i.e.,
focused on warmth, affiliation, and interpersonal closeness) to be used more with girls.
However, there is also a large number of recent studies that does not find evidence for
parents’ gender-differentiated use of control (e.g.,[41], [42], [43], [44]). Additionally, some
studies even show that parents use more autonomy-supportive strategies with boys than with
girls (e.g., [45], [46]), and are more controlling of girls than of boys (e.g., [46], [47]). The evi-
dence with regard to parents’ differential use of psychological control is especially inconsistent,
indicating that parental psychological control is higher among boys than girls [29], [48], or
that there are no gender differences in the use of psychological control [49].
Factors Related to Gender-Differentiated Parenting
Observational context.
An important question with regard to the magnitude of gender
differences in parental control is whether this difference is context-specific. In the meta-analy-
sis by Leaper et all [7] less structured and more naturalistic situations and activities yielded the
greatest gender differences. Leaper and colleagues suggest that this might be due to the fact that
in highly structured situations the demand characteristics of the task will lead to a smaller
range of possible behaviors, which minimizes naturally occurring differences in parenting and
child behavior. In the current meta-analysis, we expected the naturalistic context–in which par-
ent and child are allowed to behave as they would normally do–to yield the greatest gender dif-
ferences because it is the least structured situation, followed by free play, followed by more
structured tasks such as problem-solving tasks, and discipline tasks (e.g., “Clean up”, “Don’t
touch”, delay of gratification)[50]. The distinction between these four types of activities is quite
common in studies on observed parenting practices [50]. In fact, they reflect a continuum of
structured to non-structured activities.

 Child behavior.
Differential control of boys and girls may not, or not only, result from
parental attitudes about how to treat boys versus girls, but as a reaction to pre-existing gender
differences in child behavior. Large longitudinal studies with ethnically and socioeconomically
diverse samples provide ample evidence for the bidirectional association between parental con-
trolling or autonomy-supportive strategies on the one hand and child disruptive behaviors at
the other hand (see [51], [52], [53]). Similarly, large population-based longitudinal twin studies
from the US and UK have shown that cooperative and/or prosocial children (aged 2–12 years
old) are more likely to elicit positive reactions from their mothers and fathers, whereas children
with tendencies toward disruptive behavior elicit negative reactions from their mothers and
fathers (evocative rGE, [51], [54], [55]). Given this evidence and the fact that boys have been
found to show more disruptive behavior problems than girls during childhood and adolescence
[56], [57], [58], [59], and because boys have shown more genetic liability for disruptive behav-
ior problems than girls [60], [61]), they may also be more likely to elicit controlling behavior
from their parents.
There is at least one study showing that it is not only a gender difference in child behavior
that elicits the different treatment of boys and girls. In this 10-year longitudinal population-
based study of approximately 1,000 US children between the ages of 1 and 20 years it was
found that mothers and fathers were harsher with boys than with girls [62]. Boys and girls in
this study did not differ in terms of temperament, so the harsher treatment of boys was not
because they were more difficult to begin with. As a response to this harsh treatment, especially
by mothers, boys appeared to become more difficult and noncompliant. However, it should be
noted that this is a single study, relying on questionnaires and interviews, without observa-
tional data. Thus, potential effects of child temperament or behavior on gender-differentiated
parenting cannot be ruled out conclusively.
In the current meta-analysis we tried to take the child’s behavior during the task into
account (e.g., using proportion scores, or including child behavior as a covariate in the analy-
ses), to disentangle differences in parental control toward boys and girls from differences in
behavior of boys and girls. We expected effect sizes to be larger in studies that did not control
for child behavior, because in these studies the child effect on gender-differentiated parenting
is not controlled for. In a related vein we expected parents’ differential use of controlling or
autonomy-supportive strategies to be less pronounced in clinical or at risk samples (e.g., child
has some disorder, or shows high or clinical levels of problem behavior) compared to healthy
samples. In these samples boys and girls show more similar levels of problem behavior, and are
thus unlikely to elicit differential reactions by their parents based on their behavior. Alterna-
tively, the similar level of child problems in boys and girls in these families may be the conse-
quence of parents’ similar use of controlling and autonomy-supportive practices with boys and
girls that may have caused the problem behaviors in the first place.
Child age.
Variation in effect sizes for gender differences in parental control may also be
related to developmental level. The evidence with regard to developmental level is, however,
inconclusive. Biosocial theory does not explicitly incorporate child age effects [2], [3]. How-
ever, pressures to conform to gender roles increase with child age, and the pressure to conform
might be highest in adolescence [63]. Gender-specific parenting may increase as children get
older in order to prepare children for the greater pressures toward gender role conformity [64].
There is also meta-analytic evidence convergent with these propositions; Leaper and colleagues
[7] found that gender differences in mothers’ directive speech were greater with older children
than with younger children. However, Lytton and Romney [8] found that gender differences
actually decreased with age, specifically for disciplinary strictness. With regard to parental con-
trol, one might argue that gender differences in parental control decrease with child age,
because parental control generally decreases over time due to increases in children’s self-

 control [65]. These generally lower levels of parental control with older children may reduce
the statistical power to detect differential treatment of boys and girls, leading to smaller effect
sizes. Therefore, we tested two competing hypotheses; 1) parents’ gender-differentiated control
increases with child age; 2) parents’ gender-differentiated control decreases with child age.
Socioeconomic status (SES) and culture.
Parents’ SES and cultural backgrounds may also
be a moderator of the differential control of boys and girls. There is ample evidence that higher
SES (i.e., education, salary) is associated with less traditional views on gender roles [66], [67],
[68]. Similarly, there is evidence that lower-SES families show more gender-differentiated par-
enting than middle-class families [69]. This is indeed what would be expected in light of bioso-
cial theory [2], [3], because the more traditional views about gender roles in lower-SES families
would lead to a bigger differentiation between boys and girls. In the current meta-analysis, we
expected the differential control of boys and girls to be greater in lower-SES families compared
to middle-class families.
There may also be cultural variation in the way parents treat boys and girls. From the per-
spective of biosocial theory [2], [3], one might argue that in cultures with big differences in the
gender roles of men and women (i.e., big gender gap), parents will differentiate more between
their sons and daughters to prepare them for adult life in a culture with big differences in gen-
der roles. Data on the gender gap (gender differences in health, life expectancy, access to educa-
tion, economic participation, salaries, job type, and political engagement) showed that
Scandinavian and Western European countries generally have the lowest gender gap in the
world [70], and that North-American countries have a somewhat bigger gender gap. Latin-
American and Asian societies have intermediate levels of gender inequality. The largest gender
inequality can be found in Middle-East and North-African societies. Thus, with regard to the
ethnicity of the sample, we expected gender differences in control of boys and girls to be
smaller in cultures where there are small differences in the roles of men and women (e.g., West-
ern vs Eastern countries).
Publication year.
In recent decades the division of gender roles has become less strict in
most modern Western societies [71], [72], which according to biosocial theory would lead to
more egalitarian attitudes about gender, and consequently less differentiation between boys
and girls [2], [3]. Moreover, gender equality has increased in most Western societies over the
decades [73]. Therefore, we expected that effect sizes would be smaller in recent studies com-
pared to older studies.
Other moderators. We also examined some moderators in an explorative way, because
they were also examined or proposed in previous meta-analyses [7], [8]; observation length,
home versus lab setting, verbal versus nonverbal behavior, gender of the coders of parenting
behavior, gender of the first author, percentage of male authors, and publication outlet. No
clear predictions could be made for these moderators.
The Current Study
The current meta-analysis was conducted to determine the extent to which parents control
their sons and daughters differently. We tested the following hypotheses based on biosocial
theory and previous meta-analyses: (a) mothers and fathers use more controlling strategies,
including psychological control and harsh physical discipline, with their sons than with their
daughters [2], [3], [8], [48]; (b) mothers and fathers use more autonomy-supportive strategies
with their daughters than with their sons [2], [3], [7]; (c) fathers’ controlling and autonomy-
supportive strategies are more gender-differentiated than mothers’ controlling and autonomy-
supportive strategies [2], [3], [8]. A conceptual analysis with expert raters was used to classify
parental control variables as controlling and autonomy-supportive.

 Aspects of the current meta-analyses that extend previous meta-analytic work include: 1) a
focus on parental control as a specific construct to examine gender-differentiated parenting,
including psychological control and harsh physical control, 2) a comparison between mothers’
and fathers’ parental control, 3) an examination of the effect of procedural moderators, 4) a
comparison of studies that control and do not control for child behavior, thus addressing alter-
native explanations for gender-differentiated parental control, and 5) the inclusion of studies
that have been conducted during the past two decades.
Methods
Literature Search
The PRISMA guidelines were used for conducting and reporting the current meta-analysis
[74] (see S1 Text). There is no review-protocol for the current meta-analysis. Three search
methods were used to identify eligible studies published up until June 1st, 2015. First, the elec-
tronic databases of Web of Science (WOS), ERIC, PsychInfo, Online Contents, Picarta, and
Proquest Dissertations and Theses were searched for empirical, peer-reviewed articles using
the keywords for parental control in observational settings (see S2 Text). For WOS, additional
restrictions were used based on WOS categories. These restrictions are listed in S1 Table.
Studies were included if they: a) examined differences in parental control of boys and girls
between the ages of 0 and 18 years; b) used observations of parental control (e.g., free play,
problem solving, discipline setting, naturalistic). Control was defined as “strategies parents use
to alter the child’s behavior”. Studies were excluded if parental control was assessed in relation
to gender socialization (e.g., parental control of sex-typed play), as this was considered to be a
different socialization area. There were no restrictions with regard to the language of the paper,
as long as an English abstract was available for screening purposes. During the full-text screen-
ing phase, papers that were written in languages other than English (one Turkish, one Chinese,
three Spanish, one French, and two German) were translated by native speakers. Of the
included publications, one was published in German and one in Spanish.
First, we checked whether the search terms yielded all discipline-related articles included in
the Lytton and Romney [8] meta-analysis. This was indeed the case. Second, we searched the
reference lists of relevant reviews and meta-analyses on parental control [7], [20], [25], [75].
Third, the reference lists of the articles and dissertations that met our inclusion criteria were
also searched for eligible studies. We applied a very broad strategy with this reference search,
including all articles that mentioned any of our search in the title terms, or one of the following
more general constructs: parenting, socialization, parent-child interaction/speech, parental
behavior/behaviour. The database search and reference list search together yielded 7739 hits.
Fig 1 depicts the flow chart of the literature search.
Agreement between the first and second authors on the inclusion of studies was determined
on a random subset of 100 studies, oversampling included studies. Studies were first screened
only on the basis of their abstracts, followed by a full-text screening of the selected studies.
Agreement was satisfactory for both the abstract screening (agreement 92%) and the full-text
screening (agreement 100%). Disagreements between the authors were resolved by discussion
until consensus was achieved. After the reliability assessment, the first author screened the
remainder of the articles, but consulted the second author in cases of doubt.
To ascertain the independence of samples in the meta-analysis, several precautions were
taken. First, for studies conducted on the same sample, the publication with the maximum or
most relevant information was included. Second, when a publication separately reported gen-
der-differentiated control for more than one sample (e.g., different age groups, different ethnic-
ities), these sub-samples were treated as independent samples, but only if the sub-sample was

 relevant to one of the moderators of the current study (e.g., age, normative sample, observation
setting). For other sub-samples (e.g., long divorced vs. recently divorced) a combined effect
size was calculated. Third, when a publication reported different outcomes on the same sample,
they were averaged if they concerned the same type of parental control (e.g., praise and

 guidance averaged for autonomy-supportive strategies). If they reported outcomes on different
observation settings (e.g., free play, teaching task, discipline task) they were averaged for the
overall meta-analysis, but for the analyses with task setting as moderator one of the settings
was randomly selected. This procedure yielded 126 publications with data from 146 indepen-
dent samples encompassing a total of 15,034 families. The studies that were included in the
meta-analyses are presented in Table 1.
Conceptual Analysis: the Sorting Task
Because the grouping of dependent variables may have an important effect on the outcome of a
meta-analysis, a sorting task with experts was used (see [19], [188]). Experts were defined as
persons who had been trained and actively involved in research on parenting for several years
and who were at least participating in a relevant graduate program. A total of 10 experts were
asked. Five of the coders had a doctoral degree; the others were advanced graduate students.
Overall, 313 parental control constructs were identified from the selected publications.
Because some of the 313 constructs were almost identical, the first, second, and third authors
together grouped the constructs that were obviously (near-)identical. Any differences were
resolved through discussion and consensus. The grouping resulted in a set of 147 different con-
structs. Each construct was printed on a separate card, including the definition that was given
in the paper and examples of the specific parenting construct. Any information about the
source of the construct was left out. Separate sets of cards were made for the four settings in
which parental control was observed (e.g., free play, problem solving, discipline setting, natu-
ralistic). This was done because certain aspects of parental control may be evaluated differently
depending on the setting in which it was observed [29]. Experts were asked to sort the con-
structs into three groups of parental control (appropriate/positive, not-appropriate/negative,
and neutral, with regard to optimal child development), separately for the four different obser-
vation settings. The appropriate/positive and not-appropriate/negative categories correspond
with the autonomy-supportive and controlling strategies as proposed by self-determination
theory [12]. A neutral category was included only for the sorting task, because we wanted to
examine only the most pure forms of controlling and autonomy-supportive strategies in the
actual meta-analysis.
Agreement between the experts was satisfactory (kappas .66–.82, average .75). For 117 of
the constructs, at least 8 out of 10 experts agreed on sorting the construct in the appropriate/
positive, not-appropriate/negative, or neutral control category. The 30 remaining constructs
with 70% agreement or less were discussed by the first and last authors. For 12 of these 30 con-
structs the two authors reviewing the experts’ sorts agreed on one of the existing categories.
The remaining 18 constructs were ambiguous or contained both positive and negative elements
in one composite score, and therefore could not be grouped under autonomy-supportive or
controlling strategies. The outcomes of the expert sort can be found in S2 Table.
Further, the constructs that were identified by the experts as controlling (n = 60) were
divided in psychological control and harsh physical discipline by the first and second authors.
This search was guided by the content of questionnaires and observation scales that are widely
used to assess psychological control (i.e., Child Report of Parental Behavior Inventory; [189],
Parental Psychological Control measure; [28], Psychological Control Scale; [10]). The psycho-
logical control concepts that are assessed with these instruments are: love withdrawal (i.e.,
parental attention, love, and care is contingent upon children’s compliance with parental
requests), erratic emotional behavior (i.e., inconsistent emotional behavior directed at the
child), invalidation of the child’s feelings (i.e., tell the child how to feel or think), constraining
verbal expressions (i.e., speaking for the child), negative criticism (i.e., shame, disappointment,

 personal attack), guilt induction (i.e., continually reminding the child of all the sacrifices
parents have made to pressurize the child to comply with parents’ requests).
Of the 60 controlling constructs that were examined, only five controlling strategies could
be considered indices of psychological control: contingent emotional support (i.e., withdrawal
of emotional support after child failure), critiquing/humiliating (i.e., expressing disappoint-
ment or criticizing when the child fails to meet expectations), parental negativity (i.e., critical
or hostile comments, negative commands, sarcastic and condescending remarks), negatives/
negativity (i.e., cold, neglect, reprimands, criticism, corrections), and criticism/critical state-
ments. Five constructs were considered indices of harsh physical discipline: harsh physical dis-
cipline, physical power, negative physical control, physical punishment, physical force. The
remaining constructs contained a mix of physical, psychological and verbal control (e.g., [81],
[145], [146], [175]) or were not defined specifically enough (e.g.,[129]; harsh-intrusive parent-
ing), and were therefore not included in the meta-analyses on psychological control and physi-
cal discipline.
Data Extraction
Three types of moderators were coded: sample characteristics, procedural moderators, and
publication moderators (S3 Table). Sample characteristics included the child’s age at the time
of the assessment (continuous and categorical; 0–2 years, 2–4 years, 4–18 years), the percentage
of girls in the sample (continuous), the socioeconomic background (high, middle, low, mixed),
the ethnicity of the sample (African-American, Chinese, North-American Caucasian, West-
European Caucasian, South-American, mixed), and the clinical/at-risk status of the sample.
Regarding the ethnicity of the sample, samples that were heterogeneous in terms of ethnicity
were coded as mixed. Ethnicities other than the ones mentioned above were too uncommon to
form a separate category for moderator analyses (i.e., one Australian sample, one Turkish sam-
ple, one Indonesian sample, two Israeli samples, one Thai sample). The sample was considered
clinical/at risk if the child’s score on a clinical instrument was in the clinical range, if a clinical
diagnosis was established, or when a sub-sample of a normal sample with highest/lowest scores
on a clinical screening instrument was distinguished. Sample size was also coded, in order to
assign weight to the effect sizes. Outcomes were included in the form of, in hierarchical order:
(a) mean and standard deviation for parental use of control in boys and girls; (b) correlations
between child gender and parental control; (c) p-values; (d) statements that there were no
differences.
Procedural moderators regarding the measurement of parental control were the setting of
the observation (home or laboratory), the observation context (free play, problem solving, dis-
cipline task, or naturalistic), the observation length (continuous and categorical; 0–10 minutes,
10–60 minutes, more than 60 minutes), whether the behavior observed was mainly verbal or a
mix of verbal and nonverbal behaviors (verbal, mixed), the coders’ gender (100% male, 100%
female, mixed), and whether the frequency of parental control behaviors was controlled for the
frequency of child behaviors (e.g., proportion scores, analysis with child behavior as covariate)
or not.
Publication moderators were gender of the first author, percentage of male authors (contin-
uous and categorical; 0–30%, 31–70%, more than 70%), publication outlet (journal, disserta-
tion), and year of publication (continuous and categorical; before 1980, 1981–1990, 1991–
2000, after 2000).
To assess intercoder reliability, 30 publications were coded by the first and the second
author. Agreement between the coders was satisfactory for both the moderators and outcome
variables (kappas for categorical variables between .63 and 1.00, average .86, and agreement

 between 85% and 100%, average 96%; intraclass correlations for continuous variables between
.98 and 1.00, average .996). Coders reached complete agreement in the reliability set on
whether or not test statistics were present. Disagreements between the authors were resolved
by discussion. After the reliability assessment, the first author coded the remainder of the arti-
cles, but consulted one or more of the other authors in cases of doubt.
Meta-Analytic Procedures
The meta-analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) program
[190]. For each study, an effect size (standardized mean difference, d) was calculated. In gen-
eral, when studies reported analyses with and without covariates, statistics from the analysis
without covariates were used. Effect sizes indicating a difference between parental control of
boys and girls that was in line with our hypotheses (e.g., more controlling with boys than with
girls, more autonomy-supportive strategies with girls than with boys) were given a positive
sign, differences that were not in line with our hypotheses were given a negative sign. Accord-
ing to Cohen [191], effect sizes of d = 0.20 are considered small, d = 0.50 is a medium-sized
effect, and d = 0.80 is a large effect.
Statistical analyses. Combined effect sizes were computed in CMA. Significance tests and
moderator analyses were performed through random-effect models, which are more conserva-
tive than fixed-effect models. In the random-effect model, the true effect could vary between
studies, depending on characteristics of the specific sample. Because of these different charac-
teristics, there may be different effect sizes underlying different studies [192]. To test the homo-
geneity of the overall and specific sets of effect sizes, we computed Q-statistics [192]. In
addition, we computed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the point estimate of each set of
effect sizes. Q-statistics and p-values were also computed to assess differences between com-
bined effect sizes for specific subsets of study effect sizes grouped by moderators. Contrasts
were only tested when at least two of the subsets consisted of at least four studies each [193].
Different meta-analyses were conducted for autonomy-supportive and controlling strategies,
and for mothers and fathers. Differences in (absolute values of) combined effect sizes between
mothers and fathers for specific subsets of study effect sizes grouped by moderators were exam-
ined by comparing the 85% CIs. Non-overlapping CIs indicate a significant difference [194],
[195], [196], [197].
Funnel plots for each subset were examined in order to detect possible publication bias. A
funnel plot is a plot of each study’s effect size against its standard error (usually plotted as 1/SE,
or precision). It is expected that this plot has the shape of a funnel, because studies with smaller
sample sizes (larger standard errors) have increasingly big variation in estimates of their effect
size as random variation becomes increasingly influential, representing the broad side of the
funnel, whereas studies with larger sample sizes have smaller variation in effect sizes, which
represents the narrow end of the funnel [198], [199]. However, smaller studies with non-signif-
icant results or with effect sizes in the non-hypothesized direction are less likely to be pub-
lished, whereas for large studies, publication of small or non-significant effect sizes or effect
sizes in the non-hypothesized direction is more likely because large studies are generally
deemed more trustworthy. Therefore, a funnel plot may be asymmetrical around its base (i.e.,
for small studies no effect sizes for non-significant results or results in the non-hypothesized
direction). The degree of asymmetry in the funnel plot was examined by estimating the number
of studies which have no symmetric counterpart on the other side of the funnel [198], [200].
We checked for outlying effect sizes and sample sizes separately for the different subsets of
studies. Z-values below 3.29 or greater than 3.29 were considered outliers [201]. Five outlying
effect sizes were detected ([117] fathers’ autonomy-supportive strategies; [143] both mothers’

 and fathers’ autonomy-supportive and controlling strategies) and seven studies had outlying
sample sizes [47], [82], [120], [127], [128], [146], [178]. Analyses were conducted with and
without studies with outlying effect sizes. The outliers with regard to sample size were winsor-
ized (highest non-outlying number + difference between highest non-outlying number and
before highest non-outlying number).
Results
Parents’ Differential Use of Controlling Strategies with Boys and Girls
The combined effect size for the difference in parental controlling of boys and girls was non-
significant (d = 0.05, 95% CI [-0.01, 0.11], p = .08). The set of studies was highly heterogeneous
(Q = 498.64, p < .01). Excluding outlying effect sizes (k = 2), the combined effect size was sig-
nificant but small (d = 0.08, 95% CI [0.05, 0.12], p < .01; Table 2) in a heterogeneous set of
studies (Q = 224.94, p < .01). The effect size was positive, indicating that parents used more
controlling strategies with boys than with girls. Moderator analyses were conducted without
outliers.
The combined effect size for the normative group (d = 0.11, 95% CI [0.08, 0.15], p < .01,
k = 140, n = 12,181) was larger than the combined effect size for the group with clinical or at-
risk samples (d = -0.03, 95% CI [-0.16, 0.10], p = .66, k = 21, n = 3,498; Qcontrast (1) = 4.33,
p < .05), indicating that the differential controlling of boys and girls was larger in normative
groups than in clinical and at-risk groups, where the gender difference was absent. Child age
was also a significant moderator (Qcontrast (2) = 6.01, p < .05), indicating that the combined
effect size was largest in the youngest age group (0–2 years; d = 0.16, 95% CI [0.10, 0.22],
p < .01, k = 41, n = 3,525), followed by the oldest age group (> 4 years; d = 0.08, 95% CI [0.04,
0.13], p < .01, k = 80, n = 7,050) and the middle age group (2–4 years; d = 0.04, 95% CI [-0.06,
0.13], p = .44, k = 40, n = 5,104). The contrast between the youngest age group and the two
older groups was also significant (Qcontrast (1) = 5.86, p < .05). None of the other moderators
were significant. Continuous moderators were tested using meta-regression analyses, but none
of them were significant.
Differences between mothers’ and fathers’ gender-differentiated use of controlling strat-
egies.
To test whether mothers’ and fathers’ differential controlling of boys and girls was
dependent on different moderators, two meta-analyses were conducted, separately for mothers
and fathers. The combined effect size for mothers’ differential controlling of boys and girls was
small but significant (d = 0.07, 95% CI [0.03, 0.12], p < .01) in a heterogeneous set of studies
(Q = 173.58, p < .01). The combined effect size for fathers was also significant (d = 0.12, 95%
CI [0.06, 0.19], p < .01) in a heterogeneous set of studies (Q = 30.33, p < .01). Although the
effect size for fathers was slightly higher than that for mothers, the 85% confidence intervals of
mothers (85% CI [0.04, 0.11]) and fathers (85% CI [0.08, 0.17]) overlapped, indicating that
mothers and fathers did not differ in the extent of their differential treatment of boys and girls;
both were more controlling with their boys more than with their girls. For mothers, observa-
tion time was a significant moderator (Qcontrast (1) = 3.91, p < .05), next to child age and nor-
mativity of the sample. Mothers used more controlling strategies with boys than with girls but
this effect could only be detected with observation longer than 10 minutes (0–10 minutes:
d = 0.01, 95% CI [-0.10, 0.11], p = .91; > 10 minutes: d = 0.12, 95% CI [0.07, 0.16], p < .01). All
85% CIs for moderators tested in mothers and fathers were overlapping, indicating no differ-
ences between mothers and fathers for the effects of the moderators.
Parents’ differential use of psychological and harsh physical control with boys and
girls.
Separate meta-analyses were conducted for two types of controlling strategies: studies
specifically examining psychological control (k = 15, n = 1,226), and studies examining harsh

 physical discipline (k = 18, n = 1,190). The gender difference for psychological control was not
significant (d = -0.00, 95% CI [-0.12, 0.11], p = .98) in a homogeneous set of studies (Q = 4.04,
p = .99). The combined effect size for the difference in harsh physical discipline with boys and
girls was not significant either (d = 0.10, 95% CI [-0.01, 0.22], p = .07) in a homogeneous set of
studies (Q = 7.38, p = .98). With regard to the differences between mothers and fathers in the
gender-differentiated use of harsh physical discipline, mothers used more harsh discipline with
boys than with girls (d = 0.12, 95% CI [0.01, 0.24], p < .05, k = 14, n = 1,190). Parent gender
was however not a significant moderator of the gender-differentiated use of harsh physical dis-
cipline (Qcontrast (1) = 1.22, p = .27). The subsets of studies on psychological control and harsh
physical discipline were too small to conduct further moderator analyses.
Parents’ Differential Use of Autonomy-Supportive Strategies with Boys
and Girls
The results of the meta-analysis on differential autonomy-supportive strategies with boys and
girls indicated that the gender difference was not significant (d = 0.03, 95% CI [-0.00, 0.07], p =
.06) in a homogeneous set of studies (Q = 139.09, p = .46). Excluding the outlying effect sizes
(k = 3) did not change the results (d = 0.03, 95% CI [-0.00, 0.07], p = .07; Table 3), again, the set
of studies was homogeneous (Q = 108.10, p = .96). Further analyses were conducted without
outliers. Although the set of studies was not significantly heterogeneous, the value of the Q sta-
tistic indicated a moderate to large degree of heterogeneity [202]. We therefore conducted
moderator analyses to examine this heterogeneity. None of the sample or procedural modera-
tors were significant.
However, publication year was a significant moderator (Qcontrast (3) = 9.00, p < .05), which
was confirmed in a meta-regression (B = 0.01, 95% CI [0.00, 0.01], p < .05). Test of time-
related trends showed a significant positive correlation between year of publication (1971–

and standardized Cohen’s d. In the 70s and 80s, effect sizes are negative, indicating that boys
received more autonomy-supportive parenting than girls. From 1990 onward, the positive
effect sizes indicate that girls received more autonomy-supportive parenting than boys.
Because the scatter plot suggested possible non-linearity in the association between year of
publication and Cohen’s d, a quadratic function was also tested but this did not fit the data

 better than the linear function (both models z = 2.56). Because publication year was signifi-
cantly associated with the moderator observation time (r = -.18, p < .05) and percentage male
authors (r = -.17, p < .05) a multivariate regression analysis was also conducted, but publica-
tion year was the only significant moderator (B = 0.01, 95% CI [0.00, 0.01], p < .01).
Differences between mothers’ and fathers’ gender-differentiated use of autonomy-sup-
portive strategies.
To test whether mothers’ and fathers’ use differential autonomy-support-
ive strategies with boys and girls was dependent on different moderators, two meta-analyses
were conducted separately for mothers and fathers. The combined effect size for mothers’ dif-
ferential autonomy-supportive strategies with boys and girls was not significant (d = 0.04, 95%
CI [-0.01, 0.08], p = .09) in a homogeneous set of studies (Q = 88.22, p = .73). The combined
effect size for fathers was also not significant (d = 0.00, 95% CI [-0.08, 0.08], p = .99) in a homo-
geneous set of studies (Q = 15.75, p = .97). For both mothers and fathers, none of the modera-
tors were significant.
Publication Bias
There was no evidence for publication bias in the funnel plots (see S1 and S2 Figs). Using the
trim and fill method [198], [200], asymmetries (missing studies in the non-hypothesized direc-
tion) were not found in the meta-analyses on controlling and autonomy-supportive strategies.
Discussion
Surprisingly few differences were found in parents’ use of control with boys and girls. Of the
four different types of observed parental control (including autonomy-supportive strategies,
overall controlling strategies, psychological control, and harsh physical control), parents only
differentiated between boys and girls with regard to overall controlling strategies. Parents were
slightly more controlling with boys than with girls, but the effect size can be considered negligi-
ble. Some significant but very small moderator effects were found. First, the combined effect
size for controlling strategies was larger for younger children than for older children and larger
in normative groups than in at-risk and clinical groups. Second, parents showed more auton-
omy-supportive strategies with boys than with girls before 1990, whereas in studies from 1990
onward, parents showed more autonomy-supportive strategies with girls than with boys. Con-
trary to our expectations, mothers and fathers did not differ in the extent to which they used
differential parental control with boys and girls.
The nonsignificant and small effect sizes for gender-differentiated parental control imply
that there is considerable similarity in parents’ control of boys and girls. As parental control
plays an important role in children’s development of autonomous or controlled regulation of
behavior [13], [14], parents appear to use similar levels of autonomy-supportive parenting and
controlling parenting with boys and girls to support optimal development in both sons and
daughters. These findings argue against the propositions of biosocial theory that parents use
gender-differentiated parenting as a means of gender-role socialization. Apparently, mothers
and fathers do not use different control strategies with boys and with girls to prepare them for
their future gender roles in society. It is possible that parents do not regard child outcomes
associated with parental control (e.g., self-regulation) as relevant to masculinity or femininity,
and therefore do not socialize boys and girls differently with regard to control [203]. Parents
might use more specific and subtle gender socialization practices to influence their children’s
gender-role behavior. There is evidence that gender differentiation and discrimination has
become less blatant and increasingly subtle in many contemporary societies [204]. In addition,
larger and more consistent differences in the treatment of boys and girls are found with regard
to parents’ encouragement of gender-typical activities [8], parental gender talk [205], and

 parents’ toy, clothing, and chore choices for children [206]. Moreover, two large longitudinal
studies focusing on gender-specific emotion socialization [95] and physical discipline in
response to boys’ and girls’ noncompliance [207] have found that fathers differential socializa-
tion of boys and girls was related to larger gender differences in child behavior a year later [95].
In the current meta-analysis we did not find evidence for parents using the specific strategies
harsh physical control and psychological control differently with boys and girls, which might
be due to a lack of power.
Our findings are not necessarily discordant with the argument of gender schema theories
[4] that parents’ gender-differentiated use of controlling and autonomy supportive strategies
is likely to be influenced by parents’ gender-role stereotypes. In the current meta-analysis we
were unable to examine whether parents’ gender stereotypes influenced gender-differenti-
ated parenting practices, as hardly any studies provided pertinent data. Parents with tradi-
tional attitudes about gender roles might have been more likely to show gender-
differentiated parenting that reinforces gender-role consistent behavior (e.g., more harsh or
physical control of boys than girls, more gentle control and guidance of girls than of boys)
than other parents.
Some significant moderators of parents’ gender-differentiated use of control were found,
but the effect sizes were very small. First, the effect size for controlling strategies was largest in
studies with children between 0 and 2-years-old, a time in which gender differences in disrup-
tive behavior or difficult temperament are generally less pronounced [59], [208], [209]. This
finding argues against parents’ gender-differentiated use of controlling strategies being elicited
by pre-existing gender differences in behavior (i.e., child-elicited effect). Second, the finding
that differential controlling of boys and girls was detected in studies that used normative sam-
ples rather than clinical or at-risk samples might indicate specific interaction dynamics in fami-
lies experiencing problems. Third, with regard to autonomy-supportive strategies, we found
that in earlier studies parents used more autonomy-supportive strategies with boys than
toward girls, whereas from 1990 onward, parents used more autonomy-supportive strategies
with girls than toward boys. These findings might be attributable to historic changes in child
rearing, with a strong parental preference for and involvement with sons in the 70s and 80s
changing to a greater preference for and involvement with daughters after 1990 [210], [211],
[212], [213], [214].
The majority of the moderators were not significant. Most importantly, mothers and fathers
did not differ in the extent of their differential use of controlling or autonomy-supportive strat-
egies with boys and girls. This was unexpected based on biosocial theory [2], [3] and previous
findings of more gendered parenting by fathers than mothers [6], [8]. It is possible that moth-
ers and fathers differ in their gender-differentiated parenting practices only with regard to very
specific socialization areas, which were not represented in general measures of parental control.
Further, we did not find any moderating effect for the observed task or the observational set-
ting. Apparently, the demand level of the observational setting do not influence gendered pat-
terns of parental control. Last, differential control toward boys and girls was not dependent on
the socioeconomic status of the family, the ethnicity of the sample, the gender of the first
author, the percentage of male authors, or the publication outlet. Especially the null findings
with regard to ethnicity and socioeconomic status of the sample were unexpected in light of
biosocial theory [2], [3]. It may be that the relatively small number of studies with homoge-
neous ethnicities or low-SES parents decreased the power to detect effects of ethnicity and SES
on gender-differentiated parenting. However, these results could also indicate that the strict-
ness of the gender roles in a family, which is closely linked to ethnicity and SES, are not related
to the level of gender-differentiated discipline.

 Limitations and Future Directions
Despite the strengths of the present meta-analytic study, some limitations need to be addressed.
First, although we identified several significant moderators of differential control toward boys
and girls, there was still considerable variation in effect sizes in some sets of studies. This points
to other factors, such as the strength of parents’ gender stereotypes, which may account for var-
iations in gender-differentiated parenting. Lumping together parents with traditional and
counter-stereotypical gender attitudes in empirical studies and in the current meta-analysis
may have obscured any systematic differences in the differential control of boys and girls. This
would also contribute to large differences between studies and individual differences within
studies. Future research on gender-differentiated parenting should take parents’ gender stereo-
types into account, to further elucidate why some parents do use different parenting strategies
with boys and girls and others do not. These studies should also longitudinally investigate the
consequences of gender-differentiated parenting for gender differences in child behavior, as
very few studies have actually examined parents’ role in the development of gender differences
in children’s behavior [38], [39], [95]. Second, the sorting of the parental control constructs
was necessary because of conceptual problems with the control construct (i.e., very dependent
on the situation), but it has the disadvantage of losing information with regard to behaviors
that were grouped under the neutral control category.
Third, it is important to note that almost all studies in this meta-analysis adopted a
between-family design to examine differences in parenting boys and girls. This is an approach
where parental control in families with boys is compared with the control practices in families
with girls. An important limitation of this approach is that differences between boys and girls
in parenting practices do not necessarily reflect a gender difference, but can also be caused by
other underlying differences in family characteristics, such as family-interaction patterns. It is
of vital importance to examine gender-differentiated parenting within families to account for
such factors. In the current meta-analysis it was not possible to compare studies that used a
between-family design with studies that employed a within-family design, simply because there
were too few studies with within-family comparisons. More studies with a within-family design
are needed to disentangle the effect of child gender on parenting practices from between-family
effects. Such studies also enable testing whether gender-differentiated socialization is more pro-
nounced in families that include both boys and girls compared to families with all girls or all
boys [215].
Last, very few observation studies included a focus on harsh physical discipline or psycho-
logical control. In most studies the controlling strategies included a mix of physical, psycholog-
ical, or negative verbal strategies. More studies with a focus on observed psychological control
or harsh physical discipline are needed to examine whether parents use these excessive control
strategies differently with boys and girls (as opposed to milder controlling strategies). This is
especially important because psychological control and harsh physical discipline might be
prone to social desirability in self-report studies [216], and because of their detrimental effects
on child development [10], [15], [26], [27], [28], [30], [31]. Although psychological control
and harsh discipline are difficult to observe in short observation periods, previous research has
shown that it can be done reliably and with meaningful results (see [10], [217]). Relatedly, con-
ducting a meta-analysis on studies using questionnaires to assess parental control might have
resulted in different findings than the current meta-analysis. Questionnaires can assess a broad
range of naturalistic behaviors but have the disadvantage of reporter bias, whereas observa-
tions, albeit more objective, focus on specific behaviors in a structured setting with an experi-
menter present. However, the literature on (self-) reported gender-differentiated parental
control is as inconsistent as the literature on observed parental control. Some studies found no

 differences between boys and girls (e.g., [75], [218]), others showed that girls received more
autonomy support (e.g., [219]) or controlling parenting (e.g., [220]) than boys, or that boys
received more autonomy support (e.g., [221]) or controlling (e.g., [222]) than girls.
Conclusion
The current meta-analytic study extends previous meta-analytic work from the 1990s on
parents’ differential behavior toward boys and girls by focusing on observations of verbal and
physical parental control in a variety of settings and contexts, and by providing a contemporary
update. Overall, the effects of child gender on parents’ use of control were very small, indicating
large similarities in parents’ control strategies with boys and girls. These findings question the
importance of gender-differentiated parental control as a means of gender socialization and as
a mechanism underlying gender differences in child behavior. However, the large differences
between studies and the individual differences within studies suggest that some parents do
treat their sons and daughters differently with regard to parental control. Parents’ gender ste-
reotypes might explain why some parents do treat their sons and daughters differently and oth-
ers do not, but this mechanism has yet to be confirmed empirically.
