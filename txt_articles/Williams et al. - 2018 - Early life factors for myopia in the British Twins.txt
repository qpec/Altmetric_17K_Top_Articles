Synopsis/Precis 
 
A UK twin cohort examining risk factors for myopia across childhood development 
identified higher maternal education, younger age starting school, and longer hours 
computer gaming as associated with myopia, whilst fertility treatment was inversely 
associated.

Abstract 
 
Purpose: Myopia is an increasingly prevalent condition globally.  A greater 
understanding of contemporaneous, early life factors associated with myopia risk is 
urgently required, particularly in younger onset myopia as this correlates with higher 
severity and increased complications in adult life.  
 
Methods: Analysis of a subset of the longitudinal, UK-based Twins Early Development 
Study (n=1991) recruited at birth between 1994-1996. Subjective refraction was 
obtained from the twin’s optometrists; mean age 16.3 years (SD 1.7). Myopia was 
defined as mean spherical equivalent ≤-0.75 diopters. A life-course epidemiology 
approach was used to appropriately weight candidate myopia risk factors during 
critical periods of eye growth. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) for myopia were estimated 
using multivariable logistic regression models at each life stage, together with variance 
explained (r2) and AUROC statistic of predictive models. 
 
Results: Factors significantly associated with myopia included level of maternal 
education (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.11-1.59), fertility treatment (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92), 
summer birth (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.28-2.90), and hours spent playing computer games 
(OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06). The total variance explained by this model was 4.4% 
(p<0.001) and the AUROC was 0.68 (95% CI 0.64-0.72). Consistent associations were 
observed with socioeconomic status, educational attainment, reading enjoyment and 
cognitive variables, particularly verbal cognition, at multiple points over the life course.  
 
Conclusions: This study identifies known and novel associations with myopia during 
childhood development; associated factors identified in early life reflect sociological and 
lifestyle trends such as rates of maternal education, fertility treatment, early schooling, 
and computer games.

Myopia, or near sightedness, occurs when there is axial elongation of the eye in 
childhood resulting in a focused image forming in front of the retinal plane. This 
requires refractive correction but continues to place an individual at an increased risk 
of potentially sight threatening diseases 1. The prevalence of myopia is has increased 
worldwide, most dramatically in urban Asia 2. There is increasing interest in strategies 
to reduce the development and progression of myopia during childhood. 
 
Before the age of two years there is rapid eye growth 3, correlating with the reduction of 
the typical hyperopia of infancy (emmetropisation). Scleral remodelling allows axial 
growth of the eye to near-adult size by the age of 10 4. Early visual experience is highly 
influential in eye growth and refractive development 5. Future myopic status can be 
predicted by refraction in childhood 6, whilst early onset myopia is associated with 
higher myopia in adulthood and a greater risk of ocular complications. 
 
Although genetic inheritance is a key determinant of myopia 7, genetic factors alone 
cannot explain the rising prevalence. Given the rapid ocular growth in early life, this 
study analysed various candidate myopia risk factors using a life-course epidemiology 
approach. This enables appreciation for risk accumulation over childhood development, 
identification of processes operating across different life stages, and consideration of 
exposures during critical periods of development and ocular growth.

Materials and Methods 
Study population 
The Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) is a longitudinal, twin birth cohort, studied 
using multivariate quantitative and molecular genetic methods with a specific focus on 
neurodevelopment, cognition, behaviour and education. Twins born between 1994 to 
1996 from England and Wales were recruited and despite some attrition the sample 
remains representative of the UK population for this generation 8. For this TEDS myopia 
study a subset of 2625 families was selected, prioritising twins with genotype data and 
actively participating. Exclusions included severe medical problems and families who 
were not contactable.  The King’s College London ethics committee has provided ethical 
approval for the TEDS myopia study, and the research adheres to the tenets of the 
Declaration of Helsinki.   
 
Study variables 
Postal questionnaires were sent to the families in the TEDS myopia study and informed 
consent to contact the twins’ optician for a recent refraction was sought from both the 
parents and twins. A response rate of 51.7% from potential families (n=1359) was 
obtained; this comprised of 2715 twin participants. Non-responders and responders 
were similar in terms of ethnicity, gender, zygosity, age and parental employment. 
Among responders there was a higher level of school achievement - 90% of responders 
achieved higher grades (A* to C) in secondary school compared to 84% in non-
responders. Questionnaires were posted to the optometrists of the 2,283 twin 
participants who had undergone an eye test and provided consent. Non-cycloplegic, 
subjective refractive error measurements were obtained for 1991 individuals. Spherical 
equivalent (SE) was calculated using the standard formula (SE = sphere + (cylinder/2)) 
and the mean of the two eyes considered. Myopia was defined as SE ≤-0.75 diopters (D) 
with low myopia ≤-0.75 to >-3D, moderate myopia ≤-3 to >-6D, and high myopia ≤-6D.  
 
The twins, parents and school-teachers have completed extensive questionnaires over 
early life, in addition to web-based testing and home assessments. We examined 
potential myopia risk factors at ages 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16. Particular attention 
was placed on cognitive, behavioural and educational variables, together with extra-
  
7 
curricular interests, namely time outside and near-work activities. Photoperiod was 
calculated by downloading “civil twilight” hours in 1995 from a public repository 9. 
 
Statistical analysis 
Candidate myopia risk factors were evaluated using a life-course approach with five life 
stages: preconception; prenatal, perinatal and postnatal; pre-school (≤ 4 years); childhood 
(≤ 11 years); adolescence (≤ 18 years). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression 
models for risk of adolescent myopia (≤ -0.75D vs. > -0.75D) at each life stage were 
constructed, with clustering to adjust for family relatedness. In the scenario of multiple 
classes of dependent variables a test for trend was used to compare odds ratios. At each 
life stage the multivariable model incorporated adjustment for age at refraction, sex and 
factors significantly associated with myopia at any earlier life stage (p<0.05 in the 
multivariable model). At the adolescence life stage, myopic status was restricted to 
those who underwent an eye examination after the age of fourteen to avoid assessment 
of candidate risk factors subsequent to refractive error measurement. The linear 
variance explained (r2) and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve 
(AUROC) statistic of the final logistic predictive model was calculated, with adjustment 
for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction and cross-validation. Analysis was 
performed using Stata v13.1 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX).

Results 
Spherical equivalent (SE) was calculated on 1991 twin participants with a median age at 
refraction of 16.7 years (range 5.7 to 18.8 years, standard deviation (SD) 1.75, 92% 
aged 14 - 18 years). The mean SE was -0.35D (SD 1.80). The mean age at which myopic 
glasses were first worn was 11.0 years (SD 3.8). Amblyopia was reported in 5.4% and 
4.3% had a documented squint. Overall 25.9% of the cohort was myopic (95% 
confidence interval (CI) 24.0 - 27.8).  
 
Preconception  
Maternal and paternal highest educational level (scale of 1-8 from no qualification to 
postgraduate qualification) achieved were significantly associated with myopia in the 
twins [Table 1] - myopia odds ratio (OR) 1.59 (95% CI 1.00–2.51) with a university-
educated father and 2.15 (95% CI 1.09–4.25) with a mother who achieved likewise. In 
multivariable analyses only maternal educational attainment remained significant (OR 
1.31, 95% CI 1.16–1.55). Parental educational levels were correlated (r=0.43, p<0.01) 
but sensitivity analyses did not affect results. In univariable analyses there was a 
significant trend for increased myopia with a ‘stay-at-home’ father (OR 1.91) and 
increasing social class defined by the father’s occupation (OR 1.14) .  
 
Prenatal, perinatal & postnatal  
Fertility treatment was significantly associated with reduced odds of myopia in 
multivariable analysis (0.75, 95% CI 0.57–1.0) [Table 1]. Fertility treatment was 
moderately correlated with maternal age (r=0.30, p<0.01), minimally correlated with 
maternal education (r=0.05, p<0.01), and inversely correlated with both gestational age 
(-0.04, p<0.01) and birth-weight (-0.04, p<0.01). When adjusted for all of these 
correlates, the association between fertility treatment and myopia strengthened (OR 
0.63, 95% CI 0.41-0.98). We explored the association between seasons of birth defined 
by academic terms and detected a significant increase in risk across successive terms in 
multivariable analysis - those born in the ‘summer term’ had the highest odds of myopia 
(OR 1.50, 95% 1.11–2.05). There was no significant association with photoperiod or 
mediation by birth-weight. Those of non-white British ethnicity had nearly double the 
odds of myopia (OR 1.85, 95% 1.11–3.09) in univariable analysis; ethnicity sub-
  
9 
classification was not possible, although numbers of non-white ethnicity were small 
(n=85). We did not replicate the association between myopia and maternal smoking 10.

Highly correlated variables not included in multivariable model as collinearity exclusion. 
 
 Pre-school  
A large number of potential risk factors at this life stage were explored given this is a 
critical period for eye growth but only eyesight problems at age three were significantly 
associated (adjusted OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.6) [Supplementary File 1]. This probably 
reflects children with significant hyperopia, who are unlikely to become myopic - their 
mean SE in adolescence was +1.96D.  
 
Childhood  
Significant associations for increased odds of adolescent myopia were current maternal 
qualifications (OR 1.10) and a non-working father (OR 2.01) at the age of seven 
[Supplementary File 2]. Verbal cognitive ability (aged ten) was associated with myopia 
(OR 1.29, 95% 1.08-1.55), as was composite cognitive ability (g) (OR 1.22, 95% CI  1.01-
1.47). None of the factors were significant in the multivariable model. 
 
Adolescence  
Myopia in late adolescence was associated with verbal cognition at age twelve (OR 1.22, 
95% CI 1.06-1.40) and age fourteen (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07). At age sixteen, myopia 
was associated with composite ‘g’ (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.12-1.49), verbal (OR 1.06, 95% CI 
1.03-1.10), and non-verbal cognition (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.08). No cognitive variable 
was significant in the multivariable model [Table 2]. Hours spent on computer games 
per week were significantly associated in multivariable analyses (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-
1.10). Hours spent reading showed a trend towards increased odds of myopia whilst 
reading enjoyment rating was significant in univariable analysis (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04-
1.26). Number of higher grades (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.10) and ‘total points’ (OR 1.01, 
95% CI 1.00-1.01) achieved in examinations undertaken at age sixteen were associated 
in univariable analyses.  
 
Significant factors in multivariable analysis at each life stage were combined into one 
single model in 1077 individuals, with adjustment for age and sex [Figure 1]. The 
following factors remained significant: maternal education (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.11-1.59), 
fertility treatment (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 - 0.92), summer birth (1.93, 95% CI 1.28 - 
2.90), and hours spent playing computer games (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06). Using a 
linear fit model with the continuous trait of SE the total variance explained was 4.4% 
  
13 
(p<0.001), with a baseline model of age and sex contributing 1.6%. The AUROC was 0.68 
(95% CI 0.64 - 0.72) [Figure 2]. A k-fold cross validation produced a comparable AUROC 
of 0.67 (95% CI 0.63 - 0.70).

 Discussion 
We attempted to address the question of what early life factors in modern-day 
childhood contribute to myopia and identified maternal education, playing computer 
games and a summer birth to be associated with increased odds, whilst fertility 
treatment appeared protective. Suggestive associations across childhood were found 
with higher socioeconomic status and cognitive scores (akin to intelligence), in 
particular verbal cognition. In addition to novel findings, we confirm the findings of a 
previous life course study (1958 British Birth Cohort 10) that factors in early childhood 
influence ocular growth trajectories.   
 
We replicate a consistent association between maternal education and myopia in her 
offspring 11. This probably reflects several (mutually inclusive) influences including 
parenting style, socioeconomic status, wealth, educational encouragement, and 
potentially shared genetic factors. Notably in a life course analysis, under the 
assumption that certain traits remain stable, the same association is tested repeatedly 
at multiple life stages providing a more robust estimate. Therefore the association 
between maternal education and myopia, which was replicated at multiple stages, has a 
greater credibility.  
 
Fertility treatment was inversely associated with myopia - a novel finding that requires 
replication. Contrary to expectation that women undergoing fertility treatment have 
more myopia risk factors (higher educational status and subsequently older; higher 
socioeconomic status and therefore able to afford treatment), we observed a 25-30% 
reduction in myopia odds, despite adjustment for possible confounders. This could, in 
part, be related to the fact that infants born following fertility treatment tend to have a 
lower birth-weight and shorter gestation 12 and have, in some but not all studies, 
developmental delay and reduced cognitive scores 13. A further potential factor that 
requires greater research is the potential effect of DNA methylation variation in 
children conceived by fertility treatment, a link which has explored in other phenotypes 
14. 
 
In the UK children start school in the September of the academic year in which they turn 
five years. Therefore, those born in the summer could be almost a whole calendar year 
  
16 
younger than those born in autumn. In this study children entering the educational 
system at a younger age (born in the summer months) had the highest odds of myopia. 
Previous studies of Finnish, Israeli, British, and American populations also identified 
increased myopia with summer births, with several studies attributing this to increased 
natural light exposure during the postnatal period 9. We find no association with light 
levels at birth and propose the association may be attributable to early exposure to the 
educational system. Season of birth has long-lasting associations with educational 
outcomes 15 16, and axial elongation accelerates on starting school 17.  The importance of 
age of school entry presents an interesting topic for further research with potential 
implications for public health policy. 
 
Hours spent playing computer games in early adolescence increased the odds of being 
myopic. The twins answered this question around 2008 (predating hand-held tablets) 
when most computer consoles were played indoors on television screens (eg. 
PlayStation2® and X-Box®). This association has previously been reported when 
included in a total of ‘near-work hours’ 18, whilst time spent gaming was identified to be 
different between myopes and emmetropes when measured after myopia onset but not 
before 19. We did not replicate the protective effects of time outdoors 20, but this 
variable was not carefully measured in this cohort. We found an association with 
reading enjoyment in univariable analyses. The ‘liking’ of reading has previously shown 
to be correlated with myopia 21. We suggest this trait and the association with computer 
games may not simply reflect time spent on near-work activity, but something in the 
broader behaviour of those children, as others have suggested 22, or less time outdoors.  
 
Intelligence and educational achievement are established myopia risk factors 21 23. Over 
the life-course verbal cognition, and overall cognitive ability were associated with 
myopia. Generally associations were not statistically significant at early ages, possibly 
reflecting the difficulty in measuring these parameters in young children, and not 
retained in multivariable models, perhaps due to their correlation with maternal 
education. However there is a clear trend in association over childhood [Figure 3], with 
verbal cognition showing a higher level of association than non-verbal.  
 
  
17 
The age of myopia onset (11 years), as defined by the start of glasses wear, was 
comparable to similar cohorts 24, and notably younger than historical UK studies 10. A 
life-course multivariable risk factor model explained ~4% of refractive error variance. 
This is comparable to previous estimates of 2-12%18 23. Predictive models have been 
tested in longitudinal studies 6 25 26, with AUC statistics between 0.82 - 0.93. The AUROC 
in our study was 0.68, despite a lack of data on ocular biometry and parental myopia as 
used in other studies. 
 
Although the TEDS study remains population representative 8, the subsample invited, 
together with the 52% response rate, means those in the myopia study may not be. 
Higher educational status of responders may confer higher myopia prevalence. Missing 
data may affect power to detect associations - numerous potential determinants of 
myopia were explored and refractive error was only available on a subset. The myopia 
study was not initiated at the start of TEDS, therefore questionnaires were not designed 
to target myopia risk factors. As the oldest participants were 18 years, misclassification 
of adult myopic status may have occurred; however, this methodology is likely to have 
captured all of the more highly myopic individuals, who are of most clinical interest. 
Subjective, non-cycloplegic refractions by practicing optometrists were used. At age 14-
18 the subjects were old enough for subjective refraction with techniques to avoid 
excessive diagnosis of myopia. In adult epidemiological studies this method introduces 
minimal bias; in younger populations it has been found that whilst there is a large 
degree of inaccuracy in children <10 years, in older teenagers inaccuracy is less, 
particularly with subjective rather than autorefraction 27. In order to reduce over-
classification of myopia we used a definition of ≤-0.75D (as opposed to ≤-0.5D, 
commonly used in paediatric studies). Finally, these analyses identify associations but 
do not imply a causal direction; correlations between various early life factors and 
myopia could be mediated by a latent factor, such as genetics. 
 
In conclusion this study of a contemporaneous, birth cohort highlights maternal 
education, early schooling, and hours playing computer games as key predictors of 
myopia as a child enters adulthood. Fertility treatment appeared to reduce myopia risk. 
Socioeconomic factors, educational attainment, and cognitive variables were related to 
myopia at multiple points over the life-course. Given the rise in myopia prevalence, 
  
18 
likely due to changing environmental pressures in childhood, further studies of this and 
other cohorts are warranted, in conjunction with genetic data, to continue efforts to 
produce predictive models that can ascertain who should be targeted for treatments to 
reduce the future burden of this condition.
