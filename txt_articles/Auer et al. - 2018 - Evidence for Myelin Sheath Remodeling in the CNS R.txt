Auer et al. use zebrafish live imaging to
investigate how axon myelination
patterns with sheaths of different length
are formed over time. Their work reveals
that upon ablation of neighboring
sheaths, myelin can plastically remodel to
restore the original pattern, indicating a
homeostatic regulation of myelin sheath

SUMMARY
The length of myelin sheaths affects conduction
speed along axons and information propagation. It
has recently become clear that myelin may be adap-
tively modified to modulate circuit function, implying
that length remodeling of myelin sheaths should
occur. However, direct evidence for such events is
lacking. We have investigated how myelination
patterns are formed, maintained, and remodeled
using long-term imaging and myelin ablation in
zebrafish. We demonstrate that length differences
between myelin sheaths are established by rapid
and variable growth within 3 days after their forma-
tion, independently of their time of formation, and
even along discontinuously myelinated axons. After-
ward, sheaths continue extending at similar rates
to compensate for overall animal growth. In conse-
quence, once axon myelination patterns are estab-
lished, they are maintained over long periods of
time. We tested whether mature myelin sheaths can
remodel by removing individual sheaths from single
axons by targeted ablation. Remarkably, extensive
changes in sheath length and number occurred,
which frequently restored the original myelination
pattern. Our results show that axons can control
myelin growth and remodeling, and we provide
evidence for a homeostatic control of axon myelina-
tion patterns by maintenance and remodeling of
myelin sheath length, with implications for circuit
development, function, and repair.
INTRODUCTION
In the CNS of vertebrates, rapid and energy-efficient nerve
conduction along axons is achieved through their myelination
by oligodendrocytes [1]. The exact speed of axonal conduc-
tion depends on several molecular and structural parameters,
including the thickness of axon and surrounding myelin, as
well as the distance between nodes of Ranvier (i.e., the length
of myelin sheaths, commonly referred to as internodes) [2].
Changes in axonal myelination can therefore alter conduction
speeds and thus contribute to the regulation of neuronal
network communication. Over recent years, it has become
clear that myelination is dynamic and responsive to experience
[3–5]. Social isolation impairs myelination in the prefrontal cor-
tex of juvenile and adult mice [6, 7]. Conversely, learning of
motor tasks induces white matter changes in humans [8, 9],
optogenetic axonal stimulation increases myelination and im-
proves motor function in mice [10], and the genetic blockade
of adult myelination impairs learning of complex motor tasks
[11]. Therefore, it is plausible that changes in myelination prop-
erties, such as myelin sheath length, could be employed to
dynamically fine-tune axon conduction within networks. In
fact, there is anatomical evidence for sheath length differences
to control conduction [12], which opposes the long-standing
view that myelin sheath length is in a fixed linear relation to
axon diameter [13, 14]. For example, sheath length is highly
adapted to precisely control co-incidence of action potential
arrival times in the auditory system of gerbils [15]. Further-
more, cortical neurons show completely unpredictable pat-
terns of sparse and discontinuous myelination with currently
unclear function [16, 17]. It has been suggested that such
atypical anatomical patterns represent adaptations in axonal
myelination to modulate nervous system function. This means
that the myelination status of axons might be dynamically
regulated over time. However, direct evidence for remodeling
of existing myelin sheaths is still lacking as adaptive myelin
changes were so far observed in correlational studies and
may equally reflect de novo myelination of previously unmy-
elinated axons. Similarly, it is not clear whether atypical
anatomical myelin patterns reflect plastic adaptations of exist-
ing myelin or rather a snapshot of ongoing myelination, which
can occur over long periods of time in some CNS regions and
during learning [18, 19].
To date, essentially no information exists about the regulation
of myelin sheath length over extended periods of time. Such
knowledge is not only important for understanding plasticity in
axonal myelination, it is equally important to guarantee mainte-
nance of conduction speed during development. Some axons
are myelinated very early in life—a time during which the organ-
ism still grows substantially while nervous system function needs
to be maintained. Some studies have addressed control of
myelin sheath length by axons and oligodendrocytes [20–25].
However, no study has yet investigated how axon myelination

 patterns with internodes of different length are manifested, and
how they might change over time.
To investigate control of sheath length dynamics, it is crucial to
follow myelinated axons in the same animal. Although substan-
tial progress has been made in recent years on intravital imaging
of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and of myelin in the living
rodent CNS [26–29], the intractability of myelin due to its small
size and concealment within tightly packed axon tracts makes
sufficiently resolved investigations of the dynamics of axonal
myelination patterns an inherently difficult endeavor. To over-
come these challenges, we have taken advantage of the zebra-
fish as vertebrate model to carry out long-term high-resolution
live cell imaging in vivo. Here, we show for the first time how
myelin sheaths of different lengths are formed, maintained, and
remodeled using longitudinal analysis of individual myelinated
axons with their myelin and axonal subdomains during develop-
mental myelination, and after targeted oligodendrocyte ablation.
RESULTS
Variability of Myelin Sheath Length along and across
Axons
We aimed to investigate how axon myelination patterns with
internodes of different length are established and maintained
over time. To do this, we used existing and generated new trans-
genic reagents and lines to simultaneously label myelin sheaths,
myelinated axons, and nodes of Ranvier by targeted expression
of fluorescent proteins in the zebrafish spinal cord [30, 31]. We
first confirmed that myelin sheaths generated by the same oligo-
dendrocyte can be of variable length, as reported previously in
several organisms [30, 32, 33]. Assessment of randomly chosen
sheaths in mbp:EGFP-CAAX transgenic animals showed that at
7 days post-fertilization (dpf), sheath length ranged between
4 and 71 mm (32.4 ± 15.6 mm, n = 110/17 sheaths/animals, Fig-
ures S1A and S1B) and that individual oligodendrocytes could
indeed generate sheaths of the entire spectrum of lengths
observed (Figures S1A and S1B). This high degree in variability
for individual oligodendrocytes raised the question whether
internode length just follows a random stochastic distribution,
or whether it is driven by axonal requirements.
Therefore, we analyzed the correlation of sheath length vari-
ability with their distribution along and between individual axons.
To be able to do this, we generated a new transgenic reagent to
visualize nodes of Ranvier along myelinated axons, based on the
simple premise that the distance between two nodes reflects the
length
of the myelin sheath. Co-expression
of the new
cntn1b:Nfasca-EYFP reporter (a fusion of EYFP to the C termi-
nus of zebrafish Neurofascin (Nfasca), a well-described cell
adhesion molecule that localizes to nodes of Ranvier [34]) and
of cntn1b:mCherry to label axons resulted in discretely spaced
puncta of EYFP fluorescence alongside mCherry-labeled axons
(Figure 1A). Triple-labeling with cytoplasmic mCherry and
Nfasca-EYFP in axons in transgenic animals that have all
myelin labeled by mbp:memCerulean revealed that Nfasca-
EYFP puncta localized specifically to the gaps between the
memCerulean-labeled myelin sheaths (Figure 1B). In contrast
to myelinated axons, Nfasca-EYFP expression appeared diffuse
along the axon where no myelin was present (Figure S1C). Given
this pattern, we conclude that Nfasca-EYFP can be used to
assess spacing of nodes of Ranvier along myelinated axons,
and that the distance between two distinct nodes corresponds
to the length of the respective myelin sheath. When we assessed
sheath length (here inferred from internodal spacing) along fully
myelinated axons at 7–8 dpf, it was also variable and ranged
between 6 and 87 mm (37.7.9 ± 16.8 mm, n = 143/15/15
sheaths/axons/animals, Figure 1C). However, we noticed that
sheaths were overall shorter along some axons and longer along
others. Indeed, when we compared length distribution between
individual axons, about 50% of the axons analyzed showed
significant differences to other axons in a one by one comparison
(7/15 axons with p < 0.05 in a multiple comparison analysis,
n = 15/15 axons/animals). We did not observe major regional
differences in the length of myelin sheaths that were located in
dorsal and ventral tracts of the spinal cord (Figures 1C and
S1B). It is well established that there is an overall correlation be-
tween myelin sheath length and axon diameter [13, 14]. How-
ever, when we assessed axon size in our light microscopic
images (measured axonal area divided by its length), all axons
analyzed in our study were around 1 mm in diameter and did
not show a significant correlation to sheath length along the
respective axon (0.9 ± 0.1 mm, r = �0.02; p = 0.95; Figure S1D).
Therefore, myelin sheath length is more similar along than be-
tween individual axons, and can be independent of axon size.
It was recently described that certain cortical neurons in the
mouse show discontinuous myelin patterning along their axons
[16, 17]. We wondered whether sparse axonal myelination also
exists in zebrafish. And if it does, what would the distribution of
myelin sheath lengths be along these axons, given that each
sheath would have more axonal space to extend into? First,
we observed axons that were only partially myelinated (Figures
1D and 1E), reminiscent of previously described patchy myelina-
tion along mouse cortical neurons. When we followed individual
partially myelinated axons over time, we found that some of them
got increasingly myelinated over days of ongoing development
(3/6 axons, 6 animals, Figures 1D–F0). However, other partially
myelinated axon profiles remained largely stable over the entire
period of analysis (3/6 axons, 6 animals, Figures 1E and 1F0). To
rule out that the observed partial myelination resulted from
incomplete labeling of myelin in our mbp reporter lines, we car-
ried out spectral confocal reflectance microscopy (SCoRe) as
a label-free method to identify myelinated axons [27]. Using
SCoRe imaging of partially myelinated cntnb:mCherry axons in
mbp:EGFP-CAAX lines, we found that the presence and
absence of myelin observed in the transgenic reporter highly
correlated with the respective presence and absence of axonal
reflectance, indicating faithfulness of the transgenic myelin
reporter (Figure S1E). Interestingly, these myelin sheaths that
had no direct neighbors were not longer than those with neigh-
bors and within the same size range as sheaths along fully
myelinated axons (9–68 mm, 23.9 ± 14.9 mm, n = 11/11 axons/
animals, Figure 1G).
Differences in Myelin Sheath Length Are Established
within the First Days after Their Initiation
The finding that some axons have shorter myelin sheaths while
others have longer ones, and that sheaths on sparsely myelin-
ated axons are not longer than the longest seen on fully myelin-
ated axons, raised the question as to how myelination patterns
550

 with sheaths of different lengths become manifested over time.
To address this, we have carried out longitudinal studies of indi-
vidual myelin sheaths from their initiation onward for up to four
weeks of animal age (Figures 2 and S2; Movies S1 and S2).
Labeling of newly myelinating oligodendrocytes with their
nascent myelin sheaths using an olig1:memEYFP reporter
construct (Figure S2A) in mbp:memCerulean full transgenic ani-
mals was used to assess length changes of individual sheaths
from their initiation onward and to determine when it reaches a
neighboring sheath (Figures 2A and 2B). We found that, over
up to 14 days of analysis, myelin sheaths reached the vast
majority of their final length by 3 days post-initiation (dpi)
(79% ± 14% in a 7-day analysis, n = 24/6 sheaths/animals;
72% ± 6% in a 13- to 14-day analysis, n = 11/3 sheaths/animals).
During the first 3 days after sheath initiation, we saw highly
variable rates of length changes ranging between �6 and

 41 mm/day, meaning that individual myelin sheaths either shrunk,
grew, or remained stable (9.3 ± 4.2 mm/day, n = 77/13 sheaths/
animals, Figures 2C and 2D). After this time (from 4 to 10 dpi),
myelin sheaths continued to change length, albeit at much
slower rates ranging between �7 and +11 mm/day (1.6 ±
1.7 mm/day, p < 0.001, n = 74/12 sheaths/animals), so that length
differences between sheaths did not change much further (Fig-
ures 2C and 2D). This pattern of variable fast growth during the
first 3 days, followed by slow and similar growth over the
following days was independent of whether a myelin sheath
had two, one, or no neighboring sheaths at the end of the anal-
ysis. In all cases, about 3/4 of their end length were established
by day 3 of an 8 ± 1 days analysis (83% ± 17% versus 78% ±
15% versus 72% ± 15%, n = 12, 13, 14/39 sheaths, p = 0.2,
Figure 2E). Furthermore, myelin sheaths that were initiated at
much later larval (14 dpf) stages of animal development also
showed the same growth pattern as sheaths in younger animals
(5 dpf). In both cases, about 70% of sheath length were estab-
lished by day 3 of a 10- to 11-day analysis (72% ± 13% versus
69% ± 12%, from 5 dpf versus 14 dpf, n = 13/3 versus 8/2
sheaths/animals, p = 0.71, Figure 2F). In fact, for all myelin
sheaths analyzed, regardless of their time of initiation and

 presence/absence of neighboring sheaths, the growth speed
during the first days was sufficient to determine whether the
myelin sheath was relatively short or long at end of analysis. Plot-
ting the daily growth rates from 1 to 3 dpi against the respective
length at 8 dpi revealed a high correlation between early growth
and eventual length (r = 0.87, n = 16 internodes, p < 0.001, Fig-
ure 2G). We therefore conclude that differences in individual
myelin sheath length are established during the first days after
their initiation.
Mature Myelin Sheaths Continue to Elongate at Similar
Rates to Compensate for Body Growth
Although the majority of sheath growth occurred during the first
days of their respective initiation, we observed that they never
fully stopped extending during the entire time of analysis (Figures
2C–2F). Most animals, including humans, grow while they have
myelinated axons, and their function needs to be maintained
during this time. We therefore wondered whether the slow
but continuous extension of established myelin sheaths is to
compensate for body growth during zebrafish development,
which hugely increases in overall size over the time of analysis
(Figure 3A). To determine whether a correlation between sheath
extension and body growth exists, we assessed the increase of
the animals’ somite length (a reliable proxy for animal growth) in
addition to the extension of established myelin sheaths in the
same animal from 3 days after their respective initiation onward.
Indeed, we found that the relative length increase of myelin
sheaths extended at the same rate as somite length did in the
respective animal (Figures 3B and S2B). Comparison of the dif-
ference in relative sheath and somite length at different time
points after sheath initiation only revealed a significant difference
during the first 2 days of its growth, but not after this time (Figures
3B0 and S2D for exact numbers and p values). Interestingly, it
was possible to use the increase in somite length as a factor to
reliably predict extension rates of myelin sheaths that are older
than 3 days (correlation coefficient of 0.95 at 6 dpi, and 0.98 at
10 dpi, p < 0.001, n = 13 and 10, Figure 3C).
The rapid determination of myelin sheath length differences
also led to the question whether axon myelination patterns
change
over
time.

investigate
myelin

distribution changes along axons, we analyzed node of Ranvier
position

cntn1b:Nfasca-EYFP
labeling
along
individual
cntn1b:mCherry-labeled axons starting at 4 dpf, i.e., from shortly
after the onset of spinal cord myelination in zebrafish at 3 dpf. As
noted in the analysis of sheath length along partially myelinated
axons (Figure 1F), individual axons got increasingly myelinated at
different rates. During the time of increasing myelin coverage,
axon myelination patterns also showed big changes, as new

 sheaths appeared between time points, thus changing the
patterning (data not shown). However, once an axon was fully
myelinated, relatively short sheaths usually remained short,
whereas long ones remained long. When we plotted the length
of consecutive myelin sheaths (here inferred by the distance be-
tween two NFasca-EYFP puncta) starting from the soma to more
distal regions along the same axon over time, each myelinated
axon had formed a unique pattern of differential node of Ranvier
spacing (Figures 3D and S2C–C000, n = 7/7 axons/animals). This
analysis of node position along fully myelinated axons over
time showed that sheaths could still grow, shrink, and remain
stable, as we have observed for individual sheaths (Figure 2).
We also detected sheath retractions in some cases (5/60
sheaths), confirming previous studies [31, 35]. However, apart
from occasional sheath retractions, each axon maintained its
characteristic patterning over time, particularly when sheath
length changes were corrected for body growth (Figures 3D00,
3D000, and S2C–S2C000). In summary, our data show that differ-
ences in myelin sheath length were established by dynamic
growth within the first 3 days after their initiation. After this
time, sheaths continue to extend at similar rates to compensate
for body growth. In consequence, axon myelination patterns
remained largely stable over time.
Myelin Sheath Growth Can Be Restricted by Axon
Collateral Branches
The described stereotypical pattern of myelin sheath growth rai-
ses the question how it might be controlled by axons. Our finding
that sheaths along partially myelinated axons are not abnormally
long (Figure 1G) indicates that axonal landmarks might exist to
prevent the sheaths from growing further. In support of this
idea, we regularly noted that sheaths grew asymmetrically along
axons (Figure 4A). By labeling of individual myelin sheaths with
olig1:memEYFP in Tg(mbp:memCerulean) animals over time,
we frequently observed increased extension into one direction
over the other, despite the absence of neighboring sheaths as
a potential physical barrier (Figure 4A). Indeed, determination
of the position where the oligodendrocyte process feeds into
the sheath in randomly chosen sheaths in full transgenic mbp re-
porter lines revealed that the vast majority of myelin sheaths had
grown asymmetrically. About 80% of all sheaths analyzed had
the cell process feeding into the respective sheath outside a
10% region around their center (34/42 sheaths in 16 animals,
Figure 4B). One possible explanation for such asymmetric
growth of isolated sheaths could be axonal physical barriers.
Indeed, we observed that some axons displayed collateral
branches when we labeled them with a cntn1b fluorescent pro-
tein reporter. When we followed such collaterals over time, we
found that the presence of an axon collateral before myelination
always coincided with the future position of the node of Ranvier
(12/12 nodes, n = 6/6 axons/animals, Figure 4C). However, only a
third of all NFasca-EYFP nodes analyzed also showed collateral
axon branches (28.5%, 45/158 nodes on 15 axons, Figure 4D). In
conclusion,
the
polarized
myelin
sheath
growth
that
we
frequently saw can be explained by the presence of axon collat-
eral branches in some, but not all cases.
Dynamic Remodeling of Myelin Sheath Length in
Response to Targeted Oligodendrocyte Ablation
Because cessation of myelin sheath growth frequently occurred
in the absence of obvious barriers, we wondered whether the
axon has permissive and non-permissive areas for myelin

 sheaths to extend into. To test this, we have developed an assay
for rapid and precise oligodendrocyte ablation that enables us to
remove individual sheaths along myelinated axons. In this para-
digm, parts of axonal surface permissive for myelination would
be revealed and could be occupied by neighboring established
sheaths, provided they are able to dynamically remodel. To
ablate oligodendrocytes, we labeled them by expression of the
photosensitizer KillerRed, which generates reactive oxygen spe-
cies upon green light illumination [36], and which has been used
to ablate zebrafish neurons [37]. While bleaching of mbp:
KillerRed with green light was of limited success to ablate oligo-
dendrocytes (data not shown), bleaching with 770-nm two-
photon laser light resulted in highly efficient disintegration of
the oligodendrocyte soma within 1–2 hours (84 ± 38 minutes,
n = 11/6 cells/animals), and the fragmentation of myelin sheaths
soon after that (Figures 5A, 5B, 5D, and S3A; Movie S3). Impor-
tantly, this method did not lead to obvious damage of surround-
ing axons, as shown by tracing huC:tagCFP-labeled axons in
immediate proximity to the myelinating cell body before and after
cell ablation (n = 54/7 axons/animals, Figures 5C, 5E, and S3B).
In order to test whether established myelin sheaths are able to
remodel, we identified single KillerRed-labeled sheaths that
were flanked by KillerRed negative sheaths on either side. We
then ablated the corresponding oligodendrocyte at a time point
after which myelin sheaths had reached their predictable exten-
sion phase. In all ablations (17/17), we observed myelin remod-
eling, which involved dynamic length changes of neighboring
sheaths and/or the formation of new myelin sheaths (Figure 6;
Movies S4, S5, and S6). Remodeling was typically characterized
by the following sequence of events: (1) the extension of the
neighboring sheaths into the demyelinated gap from 1 day
post-ablation (dpa) (76% of all cases [13/17]; sheaths did not
extend in the remaining cases), (2) the formation of a new myelin
sheath in the remaining gap between 2 and 4 dpa (80% of all
observable cases (12/15); in three cases, the neighboring
sheaths closed the gap and formed a nodal gap), (3) a pushing
back of the neighboring myelin by the newly formed sheath
(80% of observable cases [8/10]; in 6 cases, the new sheath
pushed back neighbors that had invaded the demyelinated terri-
tory; in two cases, the new sheath pushed neighbors that had not
grown into the gap) (Figures 6A and 6D). The growth rates of re-
modeling and newly formed myelin sheaths also greatly differed
from the highly predictable rates seen normally for myelin of that
age (Figures 6B and 6C). Comparison of sheath length changes
in the ablation paradigm with their predicted changes revealed
that sheaths neighboring the ablation site re-initiated growth at

4-fold higher growth rates in the remodeling paradigm compared
to primary myelination from 4 dpi onward, a time point at which
sheaths usually were in their slow and predictable extension
phase (2.3 ± 0.9 versus 0.6 ± 0.1 mm/day growth from 4 to
5 dpi for up to 15 days, p = 0.04, n = 4/3 sheaths/animals, Figures
6A00 and 6C). Together, this shows that established myelin
sheaths are able to dynamically remodel and to grow at faster
rates than they normally would.
Interestingly, when we were able to follow remodeling myelin
sheaths for long enough (at least until 8 dpa, 6 cases), we could
even observe the re-establishment of sheath lengths that were
present prior to ablation in 50% of the cases (Figures 6A and
6D). The re-establishment of the pre-ablation pattern suggested

 to us that there may be a memory for myelin sheath positioning,
at least along some axons. To further test this idea, we ablated
myelinating oligodendrocytes that formed myelin sheaths on
only partially myelinated axons. Here, when new sheath(s)
were formed, they were very similar with regard to position and
length along the otherwise unmyelinated axon as it was before
ablation. Indeed, the relative position of the newly formed myelin
sheath differed less than 5% to the pre-ablation sheath, which
was insignificantly different to control myelin sheaths over the
same time (�2.8% ± 1.6% deviation, n = 5/4 sheaths/axons
versus �1.2% ± 1.4% n = 4/2 sheaths/axons in control,
p = 0.15 Figures 6E and 6F). Myelin sheath lengths before abla-
tion and after regeneration showed also no major differences
(18.5 ± 5.3 mm versus 18.3 ± 5.4 mm p = 0.96, n = 4/3 sheaths/
animals, Figure 6G). In conclusion, our data provide evidence
for a tight axonal control of myelination patterns, because a
re-establishment of the pre-ablation pattern along both fully
and partially myelinated axons was frequently achieved by the
targeted positioning of new myelin sheaths and by the dynamic
remodeling of established sheaths.
DISCUSSION
The length of myelin sheaths is an important parameter to regu-
late speed of axon conduction. Here, we have shown for the first
time how axon myelination patterns and myelin sheath length are
manifested and provide direct evidence for dynamic sheath
remodeling. Our analyses revealed that length differences be-
tween individual myelin sheaths are largely established during
the first 3 days after their respective initiation—a time period of
highly variable and polarized growth along the axon. Afterward,
sheaths continue to extend at a low and more similar rate to
compensate for animal body growth. As a consequence,
spacing patterns of nodes of Ranvier along a given axon are
usually maintained over long periods of time once they were es-
tablished. It remains open for how long sheath extension can
occur to compensate for developmental axon and body elonga-
tion. Myelin sheaths cannot reach an indefinite length without
causing failure of action potential initiation at the next node of
Ranvier [34]. One possibility would be the formation of a new
sheath at a node of Ranvier by splitting the node into two.
Although not observed in this study, our demonstration of myelin
sheath remodeling suggests that node splitting and subsequent
adaptation of sheath length is a conceivable mechanism. In addi-
tion to compensatory myelin length regulation, our work raises
questions relating to the coordination of myelin growth and
remodeling to establish specific axon myelination patterns.
What regulates different growth speeds of myelin sheaths?
Previous studies have reported that oligodendrocytes derived
from different CNS regions intrinsically generate sheaths of
different lengths [23]. Our results argue for a local regulation at
the axon-myelin interface because, despite all variability in
sheath length, it is most similar along the same axon. Intrinsic
and extrinsic control of sheath length are not mutually exclusive
mechanisms and can co-exist in form of a default basal and a
regulated rate of myelin growth—a recently proposed hypothe-
sis to integrate default and adaptive mechanisms of myelination
[38]. Indeed, other studies have revealed that axonal activity sta-
bilizes nascent sheaths [39], and two recent publications have
shown that calcium signaling events in young myelin sheaths,
which were in parts induced by axonal activity, can regulate
their extension, stabilization, and retraction [24, 25]. We have
frequently observed asymmetric growth of young myelin sheath
in our study. It would be interesting to know whether this direc-
tionality is also in response to axonal activity such as local sites
of vesicle release or other features of axonal physiology and
architecture.
Independent of the regulatory nature of the growth of young
myelin sheaths, they all ceased a few days after their respective
initiation, even in the absence of neighboring sheaths and collat-
eral axon branches, which can serve as restricting physical bar-
riers. One possibility is that axons show a differential distribution
of instructive (or permissive) and inhibitory axonal factors along
myelinated and unmyelinated regions of the same axon, which
could regulate sheath extension. The exact molecular nature of
regulatory axonal factors remains to be determined, but possible
candidates include surface molecules such as PSA-NCAM [40]
and Galectin-4 [41], as well as components of the extracellular
matrix, which are also of importance for the assembly and main-
tenance of nodes of Ranvier [42]. These molecules and other
node of Ranvier constituents could also serve as landmarks for
myelin positioning of regenerating sheaths along partially myelin-
ated axons, which are positioned almost exactly where the abla-
ted ones were. Such landmarks can, however, not explain how
length changes for remodeling along fully myelinated axons
might be regulated, as the remaining node of Ranvier (the hemi-
node) would have to move together with the myelin sheath along
the axon. Our data on sheath remodeling indicate the existence
of a homeostatic control of myelin positioning, at least along
some axons. We find it complicated to envision how length
remodeling, which involves simultaneous growth and shrinkage
of neighboring myelin sheaths, can be regulated solely through
activity-mediated axon to myelin communication. An alternative
possibility would be that axons intrinsically regulate node posi-
tion—a scenario in which myelin sheaths would extend or shrink
rather passively in and out of permissive and non-permissive
axonal areas. Future experiments will be required to test the
existence of such axon-intrinsic control of node of Ranvier
spacing, which could be mediated by retrograde or circuit-
based feedback mechanisms in which the axon senses when it
functions best. Nodal components are tightly linked to the
axon cytoskeleton, along which they may be moved along the
axon [43]. An axon intrinsic control of its own myelination pattern
would also explain how very precise myelin patterns can emerge
along single axons, like the finding that myelin sheaths get pro-
gressively shorter toward the Calyx of Held synapse [15].
Myelin sheath length is one of several parameters that affect
conduction. We do currently not know how the observed length
changes eventually affect axon function. However, in contrast to
altering myelin thickness or ion channel density, changing sheath
length, which can go along with changes in nodal length, pro-
vides a relatively quick regulatory mechanism of axon function,
as it was recently proposed [44]. All axons analyzed in this study
are parts of spinal locomotor circuits, which need to be func-
tional for coordinated swimming behavior from larval stages
onward. It is hence not surprising that myelinated axon patterns
establish relatively quickly as we report here. However, we were
surprised to see how dynamic myelin sheaths remodel, which

 may therefore represent one regulatory mechanism to maintain a
functional homeostasis, for example, during naturally occurring
death and turnover of single oligodendrocytes [45].

 METHOD DETAILS
Transgenesis constructs
Sequences of all primers used are listed in Table S1. We generated p5E_olig1(4.2) by PCR amplification of a 5.4kb of gene regulatory
sequence directly upstream of the start codon of the zebrafish olig1 gene (Ensembl: ENSDARG00000040948) from genomic DNA of
AB wild-types using the primer combination olig1_F_SalI and olig1_R_SacII (Table S1). The PCR product was then cut with KpnI
(endogenous restriction site in olig1 upstream regulatory region) and SacII restriction enzymes to obtain a 4.2kb product of olig1
upstream regulatory sequence, which was subsequently cloned into p5E_MCS [47].
To generate pME_NFasca_nostop, we PCR amplified the coding sequence of the zebrafish neurofascin gene (Ensembl:
ENSDART00000112655.3), which contains a Mucin homology domain (aa933-1035, exon22 ff) specific for the neuronal isoform of
mammalian Neurofascin-186, from cDNA of 5dpf AB wild-types with the stop codon removed from the 30 terminus using primers
attB1_NFasca_F and attB2R_NFasca_nostop_R (see also Table S1). The PCR product was then recombination cloned into
pDONR221 using BP clonase (Invitrogen).
To generate the middle entry clones pME_memCerulean, pME_memEYFP, pME_tagCFP, and pME_KillerRed, the respective cod-
ing sequences were PCR amplified from template plasmids using the primer combinations attB1_memC/YFP_F / attB2R_memC/
YFP_R, attB1_tagCFP_F / attB2R_tagCFP_R, and attB1_KillerRed_F / attB1_KillerRed_R (Table S1). PCR products were then cloned
into pDONR221 using BP clonase (Invitrogen).
To generate the 30 entry clone p3E_EYFPpA, EYFP was PCR amplified using the primers BamHI_C/YFP_F and EcoRI_C/YFP_R
and cloned into pCS2+ using BamHI/EcoRI restriction sites (Table S1). Then, EYFPpA was PCR amplified from this plasmid using
the primers attB2_C/YFP_F and attB3R_pA_R (Table S1), and cloned into pDONR_P2P3R using BP clonase (Invitrogen).
The transgenic expression constructs pTol2_olig1(4.2):memEYFP, pTol2_cntn1b:Nfacsa-EYFP, pTol2_huC:tagCFP, pTol2_mbp:
memCerulean, pTol2_mbp:KillerRed, pTol2_mbp:tagRFPt-CAAX were generated in multisite LR recombination reactions with the
abovementioned entry clones, p5E_cntn1b [31], p5E_mbp [30], p5E_huC [46] and p3E_pA and pDestTol2_pA of the Tol2Kit [47].
DNA injection and generation of transgenic lines
Fertilized eggs at the one cell stage were pressure microinjected with 1nl of a solution containing 5-20ng/ml plasmid DNA, 25-60ng/ml
transposase mRNA [47], and 1% phenol red (Sigma Aldrich). Injected animals were either used for mosaic analysis of single cells, or
raised to adulthood. To generate stable transgenic lines, adult injected F0 were outcrossed with wild-type animals and embryos were
screened for germline transmission of the injected transgene under a fluorescence stereo dissecting microscope (Nikon SMZ18).
Mounting of zebrafish for live cell microscopy
For live cell imaging, embryonic and larval zebrafish were anaesthetized with 0.2mg/ml MS-222 (PHARMAQ, UK) and mounted later-
ally in 1% ultrapure low melting point agarose (Invitrogen) on a glass coverslip. The coverslip was then flipped upside-down on a glass
slide with a ring of high-vacuum grease filled with a drop of 0.2mg/ml MS-222 to prevent drying out of the agarose and physical dam-
age of the animal. After imaging, animals were either sacrificed, or released from the agarose using microsurgery scalpels and kept
individually until further use.
Live cell microscopy and image acquisition
Images of embedded zebrafish were taken at a Leica TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope. Individual myelin sheaths were
analyzed from mid trunk regions of the zebrafish spinal cord (between somites 13-24, one example was at somite level 27). Myelin
patterns along axons were analyzed throughout the spinal cord (neuron somata resided in somite regions 5-22). We used 448nm and
458nm wavelengths for excitation of Cerulean and tagCFP, 488nm for EGFP, 514nm for EYFP, and 552nm and 561nm for tagRFPt,
KillerRed and mCherry. As a standard, we acquired single confocal z stacks as 8 and 12bit images with a pixel size of 114 nm x/y and
a z-spacing of 1mm using a 25x, 0.95NA water immersion objective. For high resolution imaging suitable for subsequent deconvo-
lution, we acquired confocal z stacks with a pixel size of 47nm x/y and a z-spacing of 0.25mm using a 40x, 1.1NA water immersion
objective. For faster timelapse imaging, we acquired confocal z stacks at 15 and 30 minutes intervals with a z-spacing of 1mm using a
25x, 0.95NA water immersion objective using an 8kHz resonant scanner. For spectral confocal reflectance microscopy (SCoRe), we
excited the sample with 488, 561, and 633nm wavelengths and detected reflectance within 5nm around the respective excitation
wavelength as described previously [27]. Unless stated otherwise, all images shown are lateral views of the zebrafish spinal cord
with anterior to the left and dorsal to the top of the image.
Cell ablations
Mbp:KillerRed expressing cells were ablated using an Olympus FV1000/MPE equipped with a MaiTai DeepSee HP (Newport/Spectra
Physics) using a 25x 1.05 NA MP (XLPLN25XWMP) water immersion objective. Continuous confocal scans with a 559nm laser were
taken to locate individual labeled oligodendrocytes. The KillerRed expressing cell was then bleached with a 0.5 s line scan across the
cell soma using the MaiTai laser tuned to 770nm (1.75W output).

 QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data and statistical analysis
For the analysis of myelin sheath length over time we defined day 1 post initiation (dpi) as the time point when the sheath was first
detected during an imaging time line with one day acquisition intervals. Myelin growth speeds are expressed as the length differences
between two data points. The growth speed from day 0 to day 1 is defined as the growth speed on day 1. Predicted increases in
myelin sheath length were calculated by multiplying the length of an individual sheath at 3dpi with the relative increase in somite
length during the same time. To assess axon diameter, we measured the area along a 20mm stretch covered by the axon at three
different positions along the axon. The diameter of each axon is expressed as the average value of three areas divided by their
respective length. Consecutive myelin sheaths were identified by careful analysis of three-dimensional z stacks over time when
they ran in the same focal z-plane and when the opposing sheath ends aligned over time in x and y to form a nodal gap that was
not wider than 2 mm (see also Figure S4).
All data were tested for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test. When the sample size was < 5, the
Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used. All data are presented as mean ± SD in the running text, independent of normality. In the
figures, normally distributed data are shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD), whereas non-normally distributed data are given
as median with the 25% and 75% percentiles. All growth curves shown without error bars represent curves of individual myelin
sheaths. All grouped curves are shown as mean ± SD and median with the 25% and 75% percentiles, respectively. Data were tested
for statistical significance using paired and unpaired t test for normally distributed data, the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test
and Mann Whitney test for not normally distributed data. For multiple comparisons ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test
were used. Statistical significance is given as *(p < 0.05), **(p < 0.01), and ***(p < 0.001).
Image and data presentation
Images were analyzed with Fiji and Imaris. Morphology reconstructions were carried out with the Imaris FilamentTracer
module. Confocal images were deconvolved with Huygens Essential version 16.10 1p2 (Scientific Volume Imaging, the
Netherlands, __http://svi.nl__) when acquired with sufficient oversampling. Data were prepared and assembled using Graphpad
Prism 7, Fiji, and Adobe Illustrator CS6.
