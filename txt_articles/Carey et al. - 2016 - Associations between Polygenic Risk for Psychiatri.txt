Despite evidence of substantial comorbidity between psychiatric disorders and
substance involvement, the extent to which common genetic factors contribute to their
co-occurrence remains understudied. In the current study, we tested for associations
between polygenic risk for psychiatric disorders and substance involvement (i.e., ranging
from ever-use to severe dependence) among 2573 non-Hispanic European–American
participants from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment. Polygenic risk
scores (PRS) for cross-disorder psychopathology (CROSS) were generated based
on the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium’s Cross-Disorder meta-analysis and then
tested for associations with a factor representing general liability to alcohol, cannabis,
cocaine, nicotine, and opioid involvement (GENSUB). Follow-up analyses evaluated
specific associations between each of the five psychiatric disorders which comprised
CROSS—attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder
(AUT), bipolar disorder (BIP), major depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia
(SCZ)—and involvement with each component substance included in GENSUB.
CROSS PRS explained 1.10% of variance in GENSUB in our sample (p < 0.001).
After correction for multiple testing in our follow-up analyses of polygenic risk for
each individual disorder predicting involvement with each component substance,
associations remained between: (A) MDD PRS and non-problem cannabis use, (B)
MDD PRS and severe cocaine dependence, (C) SCZ PRS and non-problem cannabis
use and severe cannabis dependence, and (D) SCZ PRS and severe cocaine
dependence. These results suggest that shared covariance from common genetic
variation contributes to psychiatric and substance involvement comorbidity.

INTRODUCTION
Psychiatric disorders are genetically influenced complex traits, with heritability estimates ranging
from 28% (generalized anxiety disorder) to 85% (bipolar disorder; Bienvenu et al., 2011).
Accumulating evidence suggests that disruptions in common biological pathways may underpin
multiple forms of psychopathology (Smoller, 2013). The Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric

Polygenic Psychopathology Risk and Substance Use
Genomics Consortium (PGC1) recently identified common
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that jointly influence
liability to five major mental disorders—attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder
(AUT), bipolar disorder (BIP), major depressive disorder (MDD),
and schizophrenia (SCZ)—and thus likely represent shared
genetic etiology (Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric
Genomics Consortium, 2013; Lee et al., 2013). A more recent
study performed by the Network and Pathway Analysis Subgroup
of the PGC uncovered common genetic pathways underlying
SCZ, BIP, and MDD (Network and Pathway Analysis Subgroup
of Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2015), providing additional
support for a biological contribution to shared liability to major
psychiatric illnesses.
Though not included in PGC cross-disorder analyses,
evidence suggests that substance use disorders are heritable
(h2 = 40–
70%; Kendler et al., 2012), frequently co-occur
(Kendler et al., 2007), and are highly comorbid with other forms
of psychopathology (Swendsen et al., 2010; Hasin and Kilcoyne,
2012). Such comorbidity is associated with increased severity
and poorer outcomes for all disorders (Lehman et al., 1993),
though it is unclear whether this relationship is causal (e.g.,
psychopathology leading to self-medication with substances, or
substance use leading to psychopathology through dysregulation
of neurotransmitter systems) or the result of overlapping risk
factors (e.g., shared genetics and/or environment; Agrawal and
Lynskey, 2014). Despite this, few studies have explored the role of
shared genetic influence on comorbidity between substance use
disorders and other psychiatric illnesses. Family studies remain
equivocal about the co-transmission of substance use disorders
and severe mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder: Kendler et al., 1993; Winokur et al., 1995); however,
twin studies support the role of shared genetic liability for
more common forms of psychopathology (Kendler et al., 2003).
Collectively, these data hint at the possibility that genetic factors
contributing to a range of psychopathologies also contribute to a
general risk for substance involvement.
Though prior genetic studies of comorbidity have been
necessarily limited in scope (e.g., to common disorders among
related individuals), the development of polygenic risk scores
(PRS; Purcell et al., 2009)—continuous indices of individual risk
based on summary statistics from a genomewide association
study (GWAS)—has allowed for examination of shared cross-
trait genetic influence in unrelated and non-patient samples (e.g.,
Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium,
2013; Krapohl et al., 2015). The aim of the current study was
to examine general and specific genetic associations between
psychiatric disorders and substance involvement using PRS
derived from the PGC cross-disorder meta-analysis in a sample of
2573 non-Hispanic European–
American participants ascertained
for substance dependence in the Study of Addiction: Genetics
and Environment (SAGE; Bierut et al., 2010). We first tested
associations between cross-disorder polygenic risk (CROSS) and
a general substance involvement factor (GENSUB). GENSUB was
used due to evidence from twin studies that a large proportion of
1http://www.med.unc.edu/pgc
genetic liability is shared across substances (Kendler et al., 2003;
Agrawal et al., 2012) and the use of a similar factor score in a prior
GWAS (Wetherill et al., 2015). Because substance use disorders
are highly comorbid with other forms of psychopathology
(Swendsen et al., 2010; Hasin and Kilcoyne, 2012), with evidence
of shared genetic and environmental risk factors (Kendler et al.,
2003; Agrawal et al., 2012), we hypothesized that increased cross-
disorder polygenic risk would be associated with greater general
substance involvement. Next, we tested individual associations
between PRS for each of the five psychiatric disorders included in
the cross-disorder meta-analysis (ADHD, AUT, BIP, MDD, and
SCZ) and involvement with the five substances assessed in SAGE
(alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, opioids, and nicotine). Finally, we
tested whether these associations were substance-specific or best
explained by association with the general substance involvement
factor.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample
Non-Hispanic European–
American adults who completed the
Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE; Bierut
et al., 2010) were included in analyses (N = 2573; see Table 1
for demographic information; see Supplementary Materials and
Methods for details regarding ancestry determination). Alcohol
dependent (n = 1160; required 12-month clustering of DSM-IV
symptoms) and control (n = 1413) participants were recruited
from three large, complementary datasets ascertained for alcohol
(Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism; Reich
et al., 1998; Foroud et al., 2000), nicotine (Collaborative Study
of the Genetics of Nicotine Dependence; Bierut et al., 2007;
Saccone et al., 2007), and cocaine (Family Study of Cocaine
Dependence; Bierut et al., 2008) dependence. Alcohol dependent
cases often met criteria for a variety of other substance use
disorders. Controls did not meet criteria for alcohol dependence
or for cocaine, cannabis, and opioid dependence (nicotine
dependence was allowed) but may have used these substances
and endorsed some symptoms at non-diagnostic levels. The

version
of
the
Semi-Structured
Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (Bucholz et al., 1994),
wherein lifetime DSM-IV substance dependence symptoms were
assessed for alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, nicotine, and opioids.
As genes influencing liability to substance use initiation may
only partially overlap with genes influencing progression to
various levels of dependence (Heath et al., 2002), categorical
measures (five levels) for each substance were created to
represent differential levels of involvement: (A) no lifetime
(cannabis, cocaine, opioids) or non-regular (alcohol, nicotine)
use, (B) non-problem use (i.e., use without endorsement of any
dependence symptoms), (C) mild problems (i.e., 1–
2 dependence
symptoms), (D) moderate dependence (i.e., 3–
5 dependence
symptoms), and (E) severe dependence (i.e., 6–
7 dependence
symptoms; see Table 2 for distributions of participants across
involvement levels). The lowest level of involvement was used
as the reference group, though all groups were compared to
one another (see Statistical Analyses). For cannabis, cocaine,
and opioids, the reference group included individuals with no
lifetime history of using the substance; for alcohol, those who
had never drank at least once per month for 6 months or
longer were considered to be minimally/not exposed, while
for nicotine, this threshold was set at having smoked less
than 100 cigarettes. The vast majority of individuals (82.9%)
reported using multiple substances during their lifetime, with
17.0% reporting use of all substances assessed. Only 5.7% of
the sample belonged to all substance-specific reference groups,
reflecting no lifetime use of cannabis, cocaine, and opioids, and
no regular use of alcohol and nicotine. Lifetime histories of
problematic substance use also co-occurred, with 62.1% of the
sample reporting at least one dependence symptom for two
or more substances. Finally, in addition to alcohol dependence
(46.9%), 17.4, 18.6, 50.9, and 6.9% of the sample endorsed
3 or more dependence criteria (unclustered) for cannabis,

aFor illicit drugs (i.e., cannabis, cocaine, and opioids), the lowest level of
involvement included individuals who had never used that particular substance;
for licit drugs (i.e., alcohol and nicotine), individuals who had also never used the
substance regularly (i.e., drinking at least once per month for 6 months, or smoking
100+ cigarettes in one’s lifetime) were also included in the lowest involvement

cocaine, nicotine, and opioid dependence, respectively (Table 2).
A measure of general substance involvement (GENSUB) was
generated by performing a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on
the individual substance involvement measures in Mplus (v.7.11;
Muthén and Muthén, 2015) and standardizing the resulting
factor score (Supplementary Figure S2).
Genotyping Methods and Quality Control
DNA was extracted from blood samples, and cell lines were
developed as an additional DNA source. Samples were genotyped
using lllumina Human1Mv1_CBeadChip at the Johns Hopkins
Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). Extensive and
rigorous data cleaning was employed (Laurie et al., 2010),
resulting in quality-controlled genotypic data for 948,658 SNPs
(Bierut et al., 2010).
Polygenic Risk Scores
Polygenic risk scores were derived from the results of the PGC
cross-disorder meta-analysis (CROSS; Cross-Disorder Group of
the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2013) of 5 psychiatric
disorders (ADHD, AUT, BIP, MDD, SCZ). PRS were constructed
for the following p-value thresholds based on the full GWAS
summary statistics: 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,
0.5, and 1.0; these thresholds were selected to be consistent with
the PRS analyses conducted in the PGC cross-disorder paper
(Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium,
2013). The PRS generation pipeline was coded in Python (v.2.7.6)
using the Numerical Python (“
NumPy,”v.1.7.1), StatsModels
(v.0.5.0), and Python Data Analysis (“
pandas,”v.0.12.0) libraries.
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were required to have
a MAF > 0.02, call rates > 0.98, and HWE p-values >10−6 to
be included in analyses. SNPs within the MHC region (chr6:
25000000:35000000) were excluded due to their complex patterns
of linkage disequilibrium. All remaining SNPs were then pruned
using p-value-informed clumping (i.e., grouping linked SNPs;
R2 = 0.10, 500 kb window), leaving 101,202 SNPs in SAGE
for analysis. For each p-value threshold, the cross-disorder log
odds-ratio for each component SNP was multiplied by the
number of reference alleles for that SNP. These product terms
were summed and divided by the total number of contributing
SNPs, thus producing a single metric for each participant
representing cross-disorder genetic vulnerability. These analyses
were completed using the –
score method in Plink (v.1.9;
Chang et al., 2015). Individual disorder risk scores for the five
psychiatric disorders (ADHD, AUT, BIP, MDD, SCZ) included
in the cross-disorder meta-analysis were then generated in the
same manner. Subsequent to the cross-disorder meta-analysis, a
much larger second-generation GWAS of schizophrenia (SCZ2;
Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics
Consortium, 2014) was released, and analyses were therefore
repeated for schizophrenia using SCZ2 PRS. Distributions of all
PRS generated are presented in Supplementary Figure S1.

Polygenic Psychopathology Risk and Substance Use
across each level of involvement (i.e., no/non-regular use, non-
problem use, mild problems, moderate dependence, and severe
dependence) for specific substances and individual disorder
PRS. Due to the large number of non-independent tests
performed, an empirical significance threshold for α = 0.05
was determined using 10,000 label-swapping permutations (see
Supplementary Materials and Methods for details). The lowest
level of involvement was used as the reference group; thus,
resulting odds-ratios (ORs) reflect increases or decreases in
association for each level of substance involvement relative to
the lowest level (i.e., no/non-regular use). Wald chi-square tests
(for 1◦ of freedom) were used to examine whether the magnitude
of these resulting ORs could be equated to each other and thus
establish whether differences in PRS existed across involvement
levels (e.g., comparison of the OR between no use and use
with no problems vs. the OR between no use and use with 1–
2 symptoms). To determine whether specific disorder-substance
associations were driven by GENSUB, significant analyses were
repeated with GENSUB as a covariate. Covariates across all
analyses included sex, age quartiles, three ancestrally informative
principal components, and study of origin.
RESULTS
GENSUB Confirmatory Factor Analysis
The confirmatory one-factor model fit the data reasonably well
in our sample (comparative fit index = 0.992; root mean square
error of approximation = 0.106), supporting our proposed
unidimensional conceptualization of alcohol, cannabis, cocaine,
nicotine, and opioid involvement. Factor loadings were generally
comparable across substances, though the loading for nicotine
was somewhat lower (Supplementary Figure S2).
CROSS PRS and GENSUB
CROSS PRS were associated with increasing GENSUB factor
scores (significant at 9 of 10 p-value thresholds; most significant
at p < 0.5: β∗ = 0.110, R2 = 0.011, p < 0.001; Figure 1;
Supplementary Table S1), indicating a positive relationship
between genetic liability to multiple psychiatric disorders and
general substance involvement.
Specific Disorder-Substance Associations
Analyses of individual disorder PRS and specific substance
involvement revealed several noteworthy associations (see
Figure 2; Supplementary Tables S2–
S7 for all associations),
some of which remained significant when controlling for
general substance involvement (i.e., GENSUB; Supplementary
Tables S2–
S7). We report all nominally significant associations
below and note which survived permutation-based correction
for multiple comparisons within the text and in Supplementary
Tables S2–
S7.
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
ADHD PRS were negatively associated with non-problem
cannabis use, and were positively associated with all levels of
nicotine use (Supplementary Table S2). No associations remained

significant after correction for multiple testing. Cannabis:
Compared with nonusers, non-problem cannabis users (i.e., users
with 0 symptoms) had lower ADHD PRS. Nicotine: Users at
all levels of nicotine involvement (i.e., non-problem use, mild
problems, and moderate and severe dependence) had elevated
ADHD PRS relative to nonusers. Despite associations across
increasing levels of nicotine involvement, the magnitude of these
associations did not statistically differ from each other.
Autism Spectrum Disorder
AUT PRS were not consistently associated with involvement with
any of the substances tested (Supplementary Table S3).
Bipolar Disorder
BIP PRS were associated with increasing problematic alcohol
involvement, severe cocaine dependence, and specific levels of
cannabis and opioid involvement (Supplementary Table S4).
None of these associations survived correction for multiple
comparisons. Alcohol: There was evidence for a dose-dependent
relationship between BIP PRS and increasing number of alcohol
dependence symptoms among regular drinkers with at least one
symptom of dependence. Cannabis: Compared with those who
had never used cannabis, BIP PRS were higher and of a similar
magnitude in individuals with non-problem cannabis use and
moderate dependence. Cocaine: Relative to non-users and non-
problem users, those with severe cocaine dependence exhibited
higher BIP PRS. Opioids: Elevated BIP PRS were associated only
with mild problems (i.e., 1–
2 dependence symptoms).
Major Depressive Disorder
MDD PRS were associated with increased alcohol, cocaine,
and nicotine involvement, as well as with multiple levels of
cannabis involvement (Supplementary Table S5). Associations

Polygenic Psychopathology Risk and Substance Use
FIGURE 2 | Associations between individual substance involvement and polygenic risk scores (PRS) for five major psychiatric disorders. Within each
grid space, p-thresholds at which PRS were calculated (i.e., p < 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 1.0) are represented vertically in ascending
order. Levels of involvement (i.e., no/non-regular use, use without endorsement of any dependence symptoms, 1–2 dependence symptoms, 3–5 dependence
symptoms, and 6–7 dependence symptoms) are represented horizontally in ascending order. Colors represent z-scores for each association test, with no lifetime or
nonregular use as the reference group. For example, the red colors in the crosstab between SCZ and cannabis indicate a high correlation between genetic risk for
SCZ and cannabis involvement. The black horizontal bars in the color bar indicate the approximate z-score cutoff for significance post-correction for multiple
comparisons (z = ± 3.911). Post-hoc Wald tests comparing all levels of substance involvement with one another are reported in Supplementary Tables S2–S7.

with non-problem cannabis use and severe cocaine dependence
remained significant following correction for multiple tests.
Alcohol: MDD PRS were associated with moderate and severe
alcohol dependence relative to no/non-regular use and lesser
levels of involvement. Cannabis: Higher MDD PRS differentiated
cannabis users with 0, 3–
5, and 6–
7 dependence symptoms from
non-users. Cocaine: Compared with non-users and non-problem
users, those with severe cocaine dependence had higher MDD
PRS. Nicotine: MDD PRS were associated with moderate and
severe nicotine dependence relative to non-regular use and lower
levels of involvement.
Schizophrenia
SCZ PRS were associated with elevated alcohol, cannabis, and
cocaine involvement, along with nicotine use and non-problem
opioid use (Supplementary Table S6). Relationships with non-
problem cannabis use, severe cannabis dependence, and severe
cocaine dependence survived multiple comparison correction.
Associations with SCZ2 PRS were comparable and are described
in the Supplementary Results (see also Supplementary Table S7;
see Supplementary Figure S3 for a visual comparison to SCZ
results). Alcohol: Elevated SCZ PRS were associated with severe
alcohol dependence relative to all other categories of involvement
(i.e., non-regular use, non-problem use, and use with fewer
dependence symptoms). Cannabis: Elevated SCZ PRS were
associated with cannabis use at all levels of involvement relative
to non-use and differentiated those with severe dependence from
non-problem users and users with mild problems. Cocaine:
Higher SCZ PRS differentiated cocaine users with 1–
2 and 6–
7 dependence symptoms from non-users, and those with 6–
7
symptoms from those with fewer (i.e., 0 and 3–
5) symptoms.
Nicotine: Elevated SCZ PRS were associated with nicotine use
at all levels of involvement. Opioids: Higher SCZ PRS were
associated with non-problem opioid use.
Associations Not Attributable to GENSUB
Controlling for GENSUB revealed that the majority of nominally
significant substance-disorder relationships were driven by
associations between PRS and general substance involvement
liability, though a few substance-disorder pairings appear to be
specific: ADHD PRS with all levels of nicotine involvement and
non-problem cannabis use; BIP PRS with non-problem cannabis
use; MDD PRS with alcohol dependence relative to use with
mild problems, as well as severe cocaine dependence relative to
never-use and non-problem use, and severe cannabis dependence
relative to never-use (though, contrary to expectations, this
residual association was negative); and SCZ PRS with non-
problem cannabis use as well as severe cocaine dependence
relative to non-use and use with 0 and 3–
5 dependence
symptoms.
DISCUSSION
The substantial comorbidity between psychiatric and substance
use disorders is unequivocal (e.g., Swendsen et al., 2010;
Hasin and Kilcoyne, 2012), but sources contributing to this

Polygenic Psychopathology Risk and Substance Use
covariation remain less well articulated. Complementing prior
observations from latent genetic (e.g., Kendler et al., 2003) and
candidate gene (e.g., Yoshimasu et al., 2015) studies, we report
that PRS derived from the PGC cross-disorder meta-analysis
(CROSS; Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics
Consortium, 2013) explained roughly 1% of the variance in
general substance involvement (GENSUB) in our target sample
enriched for substance use (SAGE; Bierut et al., 2010). This
effect size is consistent with previously published cross-trait
PRS analyses (e.g., Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric
Genomics Consortium, 2013; Krapohl et al., 2015), and, though
not large enough to be informative on an individual level,
nonetheless provides support for the hypothesized role of
shared genetics in the lifetime co-occurrence of psychiatric
and substance use disorders. PRS for individual psychiatric
diagnoses (i.e., ADHD, BIP, MDD, and SCZ, but not AUT)
were
also
significantly
associated
with
specific
substance
involvement (i.e., alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, nicotine, and
opioids), and are discussed in detail below. As in Results, all
nominally significant substance-specific individual psychiatric
diagnosis PRS associations are discussed to provide an overview
of observed associations. Only the following specific PRS
and substance use associations survived permutation-based
correction for multiple comparisons: (A) MDD PRS with non-
problem cannabis use, (B) MDD PRS with severe cocaine
dependence, (C) SCZ PRS with non-problem cannabis use and
severe cannabis dependence, and (D) SCZ PRS with severe
cocaine dependence.
Specific Disorder-Substance Associations
Associations between PRS and individual substances were only
partially attributable to GENSUB, indicating specificity of certain
relationships (e.g., ADHD PRS and nicotine involvement).
This is significant, considering that twin studies implicate
GENSUB as the primary source of genetic variance in individual
substance use disorders (Kendler et al., 2003, 2007, 2012).
Our factor loadings support this high degree of cohesiveness,
with the possible exception of nicotine, also consistent with
a prior twin study (Kendler et al., 2007). Notably, unlike
prior research which has heavily relied on binary measures
of substance use or dependence, we capitalized on the range
of substance involvement present in our target sample due to
the ascertainment strategy (Table 2), including non-problem
use (i.e., use with no dependence symptoms) as well as
multiple levels of problematic use (i.e., 1–
2 vs. 3–
5 vs.
6–
7 dependence symptoms). Not only did this coding allow
us to differentiate between early/casual and later/maladaptive
levels of substance involvement, but it also allowed us to
test whether PRS were associated with specific levels of
substance involvement (i.e., to compare across groups). Despite
factorial architecture suggesting only modest residual variance,
several PRS remained associated with individual substances,
particularly at non-problem or severe levels of involvement,
even after accounting for this shared liability. This overall
finding suggests that despite genetic susceptibility across
substances being largely shared, variation at the extremes of
the phenotype may be less well captured by measures such as
GENSUB.
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
ADHD PRS were associated with nicotine and cannabis
involvement, even after controlling for GENSUB. These findings
are markedly consistent with an expansive epidemiological and
clinical literature documenting higher rates of cigarette smoking
in individuals with ADHD, even after accounting for comorbid
conduct problems (e.g., Elkins et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2012).
Consistent with prior studies showing risk effects of ADHD on
both smoking initiation and dependence (e.g., Elkins et al., 2007;
Sibley et al., 2014), ADHD PRS related to all levels of nicotine
involvement. However, these associations were all of a similar
magnitude, allowing us to conclude that the relationship was
not dose-dependent with respect to severity of involvement. In
contrast, we noted a negative relationship between ADHD PRS
and non-problem cannabis use. The evidence supporting the
role of ADHD in the use of cannabis is stronger than support
for its role in the onset of cannabis use disorders (e.g., Elkins
et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2011). However, we are not aware of any
studies that have examined non-problem use specifically. It is
possible that individuals at high genetic liability to ADHD are
less likely to engage in non-problem use and, consistent with
the literature, not at a particularly elevated risk of progression to
problem use.
Autism Spectrum Disorder
The lack of association between AUT and substance involvement
was unsurprising given a mixed literature linking autism
spectrum disorders to relatively reduced (e.g., Abdallah et al.,
2011) or elevated (De Alwis et al., 2014) risk of substance
involvement.
Bipolar Disorder
Our findings of positive associations between BIP PRS and
multiple levels of alcohol, cocaine, cannabis, and opioid
involvement are consistent with observations of markedly
elevated rates of substance use and use disorders in individuals
with BIP (Compton et al., 2007), as well as with prior studies
indicating a genetic origin of this comorbidity (Biederman
et al., 2000; Johnson et al., 2009). Notably, when controlling
for GENSUB, only a positive association between BIP PRS
and non-problem cannabis use remained significant. This
overall association with general, rather than specific, substance
involvement liability may be reflective of similar cognitive
mechanisms (e.g., impulsivity, emotion dysregulation, sensation-
seeking) that are thought to broadly underlie both BIP and
substance use disorders (Swann, 2010).
Major Depressive Disorder
Elevated polygenic liability to MDD in our sample was associated
with increasing problematic use of alcohol, cocaine, nicotine,
and cannabis, in-line with prior twin studies suggesting MDD
shares genetic liability with alcohol (Prescott et al., 2000),
nicotine (Edwards et al., 2011), and cannabis use (Lynskey
et al., 2004). Associations between MDD PRS and alcohol
and cocaine dependence remained even when controlling for

Carey et al.
Polygenic Psychopathology Risk and Substance Use
GENSUB. Prior genomewide studies of MDD with comorbid
alcohol and cocaine dependence have uncovered significant
or near-significant overlapping regions/variants contributing to
MDD alone and to MDD with a comorbid SUD, as well as
some regions/variants contributing to a combined MDD and
SUD phenotype only (Yang et al., 2011; Edwards et al., 2012).
Taken together, these parallel lines of evidence suggest that
relationships between MDD and alcohol and cocaine dependence
are substance-specific.
Schizophrenia
SCZ PRS were associated with involvement across all substances
tested, but only associations with non-problem cannabis use and
severe cocaine dependence persisted upon inclusion of GENSUB.
Notably, both substances have been previously implicated in
the etiology of psychotic illness. Cocaine use is common
among individuals with SCZ (Shaner et al., 1995), and several
neurobiological models have implicated shared disruptions in
dopaminergic signaling as a common etiological explanation
for this comorbidity (e.g., Volkow, 2009). Adolescent exposure
to cannabis has long been posited as either a directly causal
(Arseneault et al., 2004) or moderating (Henquet et al., 2008)
factor in the etiology of psychosis, but recent research has
suggested that associations may be due in part to shared genetic
factors (Power et al., 2014; Pagliaccio et al., 2015). For example,
complementing our current results, a prior study reported
a significant association between SCZ PRS and lifetime and
frequency of cannabis use (Power et al., 2014). Taken together,
these results suggest a specific genetic etiological link between
schizophrenia, cannabis use, and cocaine dependence.
Limitations
Some
limitations
of
our
study
are
noteworthy.
First,
comorbidities in the cross-disorder meta-analysis from which
the PRS were derived, as well as in the target SAGE sample, may
be subject to certain unmeasured confounds. For example, the
PGC did not examine the extent of cocaine (or other substance)
use in their sample population (Cross-Disorder Group of the
Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2013), so our associations of
SCZ PRS with severe cocaine dependence may be an artifact of
increased cocaine use by people with schizophrenia (Serper et al.,
1995), or of cocaine-induced psychosis resulting in a diagnosis
of schizophrenia (Brady et al., 1991). Conversely, though severe
psychopathology (i.e., AUT, BIP, SCZ) is likely to be uncommon
in SAGE and unlikely to influence associations, more common
psychopathologies (i.e., ADHD, MDD) were likely present.
Therefore, associations with ADHD or MDD PRS may have
been mediated by the actual expression of the disorder among
SAGE participants (e.g., people with higher MDD PRS in SAGE
develop MDD, which in turn is associated with substance use
disorders). Though data on ADHD diagnosis in SAGE were
unavailable, repeating MDD PRS analyses while controlling for
DSM-IV MDD diagnosis did not alter results, indicating that
associations between PRS and substance use outcomes were not
directly related to disorder expression (Supplementary Table S8).
Longitudinal studies of well-characterized populations, as well as
an increased emphasis on the study of substance use disorders
in consortia such as the PGC, will be critical to further address
these questions of temporality and comorbidity.
Second, SAGE was ascertained for liability to substance
dependence, specifically to alcohol, nicotine, and cocaine; the
generalizability of these findings to the general population is
thus unclear. Additionally, the factor structure of GENSUB
might be somewhat sample-specific, and residual associations
with involvement with specific substances (i.e., non-problem
cannabis use) may have been artifacts of sample ascertainment.
However, this ascertainment strategy allowed us to study the
full range of substance involvement—from never-use to severe
dependence—across both licit (i.e., alcohol, nicotine) and illicit
(i.e., cannabis, cocaine, opioids) drugs, which would not have
been possible in a population-based sample of comparable size.
Nonetheless, it is important to replicate these findings in other
samples.
Third, though multiple nominally significant relationships
between genetic risk for individual psychiatric disorders and
involvement with specific substances emerged, few survived
correction for the large number of statistical tests performed.
These results thus may represent spurious associations and
should be interpreted with caution. However, given the
consistency of certain associations (e.g., ADHD and nicotine use)
with prior genetic (e.g., Chang et al., 2012) and epidemiological
(e.g., Elkins et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2011) literature, they should
not be dismissed outright. Notably, the only disorders with
significant post-correction associations—MDD and SCZ—were
those with the largest numbers of cases in the PGC cross-
disorder meta-analysis (NMDD = 9227, NSCZ = 9379). Nominal
associations may thus strengthen with larger discovery samples,
which may provide more precise PRS estimates, as well as larger
target samples. In support of this interpretation, repetition of
schizophrenia PRS analyses with scores derived from the much
larger second-generation PGC GWAS (NSCZ2 = 36,989) yielded
associations that were generally stronger than those from the
first-generation analyses (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7; see
Supplementary Figure S3 for comparison).
Fourth, while our PRS approach yielded evidence that
shared common genetic architecture contributes to comorbidity
between psychopathology and substance involvement, it does
not provide insight into specific biological (e.g., reward-related
neural responsiveness, epigenetically medicated changes in gene
expression), psychological (e.g., anhedonia, impulsivity), and/or
experiential (e.g., early life stress, peer group) mechanisms
through which this risk is manifest (e.g., Olfson et al., 2014; Peña-
Oliver et al., 2016; Ron and Barak, 2016). Compelling evidence
suggests that psychopathology and substance involvement
share overlapping neural systems (e.g., Buckholtz and Meyer-
Lindenberg, 2012), molecular pathways (e.g., Ng et al., 2013), and
environmental exposures (e.g., Kristjansson et al., 2016). Future
PRS research probing biological systems and psychological
traits common to both psychiatric and substance use disorders
(e.g., Lancaster et al., 2016; Peña-Oliver et al., 2016) and
incorporating environmental/experiential measures (e.g., French
et al., 2015), alongside genomewide efforts to partition heritability
into specific pathways and functional categories (e.g., Lee et al.,
2012; Finucane et al., 2015), will further our understanding of

Polygenic Psychopathology Risk and Substance Use
the mechanisms underlying this comorbidity (Bogdan et al.,
2016).
CONCLUSION
Our study provides some of the first evidence that common
polygenic liability to major psychiatric disorders is related to use
and misuse of licit and illicit substances, providing new insights
into the etiology of this well documented comorbidity. Future
efforts might attempt to determine which specific biological
pathways and networks underlie this shared genetic variance,
or prospectively evaluate the predictive power of such PRS: for
instance, whether polygenic risk for SCZ predicts onset, severity,
and prognosis of illness in youth who experiment with cannabis
and other drugs. Additionally, the inclusion of a substance
use disorders workgroup in the second iteration of the PGC2
promises to provide substantially larger sample sizes in which the
current work may be replicated and extended.
