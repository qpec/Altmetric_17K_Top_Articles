Abstract
Background: There are no randomized data to guide clinicians treating patients with gallbladder cancer (GBC). Several
retrospective studies reported the survival benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and chemoradiation (CRT). In this paper, we
examine whether these publications have impacted the utilization of adjuvant therapies and whether their survival benefits
are evident in a contemporary cohort of patients.
Methods: Using the National Cancer Data Base, we identified 5029 patients diagnosed with T1-3N0-1 GBC and treated with
surgical resection from 2005 to 2013. We described trends in receipt of adjuvant treatments for three time periods (2005–2007,
2008–2010, 2011–2013) and calculated three-year overall survival (OS) probabilities for 2989 patients treated in 2005–2010. All
statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: The percentage of patients who received no adjuvant treatments was unchanged from 2005 to 2013. Adjuvant RT
decreased from 4.2% to 1.7% (P < .001), adjuvant chemotherapy increased from 8.3% to 13.8% (P < .001), and adjuvant CRT
remained stable at 15.9% (P ¼ .98). Adjuvant treatments were associated with improved three-year OS, with adjusted hazard
ratio of 0.47 (95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 0.39 to 0.58) for CRT, 0.77 (95% CI ¼ 0.61 to 0.97) for chemotherapy, and 0.63 (95%
CI ¼ 0.44 to 0.92) for RT. Adjuvant CRT was associated with improved survival in all categories, except T1N0, and in patients
with negative and positive margins.
Conclusion: Over the past decade there was no increase in the utilization of adjuvant therapies in the United States for
patients with resected GBC. Adjuvant therapy is associated with statistically significantly improved three-year OS. This
analysis should form the basis for current clinical recommendations and support future prospective trials.
Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the most common biliary tract neo-
plasm in the United States, with approximately 11 420 new
cases and 3710 deaths expected to occur in 2016 (1). Published
studies demonstrate an overall five-year survival of only 5% to
15%. There are no randomized data guiding physicians in the
treatment decision for patients diagnosed with GBC. The 2004
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines
recommended postoperative therapy with 5-FU-based chemo-
radiation (CRT) for resectable patients with greater than T1N0
disease (2). Since 2004, three retrospective publications using
the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data-
base showed a survival benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) for
patients with lymph node–positive (LNþ) disease or T2 or greater
primary tumor (3–5). Another analysis of this database demon-
strated survival benefit of adjuvant CRT in the same patient pop-
ulation (6). A recently published analysis of the National Cancer
Data Base (NCDB) on the outcomes of patients diagnosed with
resected GBC and treated with adjuvant therapies between 1998
and 2006 showed a strong association between receipt of adju-
vant therapies and improved survival (7).

Despite these publications, the 2016 NCCN guidelines (8)
have relaxed the recommendations, advocating for surgery to
be followed by one of three options: adjuvant chemotherapy,
adjuvant CRT, or observation. Because the previously pub-
lished large national database analyses included patients
treated a decade ago—until 2006—and did not evaluate the
change in receipt of adjuvant treatments in the United States
over time, our aim was to perform a contemporary analysis of
the patterns of treatment over the past decade using the NCDB
to determine the effect of previous national database retro-
spective publications and NCCN recommendations on the
adjuvant treatments received by US patients, and to estimate
the benefit of adjuvant therapies in the modern age. We also
attempted to identify any barriers, whether patient related
(such as insurance, income, ethnicity), or practice setting
related (such as volume of patients seen at an institution), to
receipt of adjuvant therapies.
Methods
Study Population
The NCDB, jointly sponsored by the American College of Surgeons
and the American Cancer Society, is a national hospital-based
oncologic outcomes database that derives its data from approxi-
mately 1500 Commission on Cancer–accredited programs in the
United States. As such, the NCDB captures approximately 70% of
incident cancers in the United States each year, making it one of
the most powerful and generalizable cancer databases in the
world (9). Ongoing validation of NCDB data accuracy and quality is
performed through internal monitoring, site surveys, and data
quality reviews (10). Data coding methods have been described
previously (11).
We identified 8514 patients age 18 years or older who were
diagnosed with a first primary American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) T1-3N0-2 GBC and received all or part of their treat-
ment at an accredited NCDB facility between January 1, 2005, and
December 31, 2013. GBC cases include cancers with topography
code of C23.9 and morphology codes of 8000-8152, 8154-8231,
8243-8245, 8250-8576, and 8980-8981, according to the third edi-
tion of the International Classification of Disease for Oncology (ICD-O-
3) (12). Our analytic study population included 5029 patients after
excluding 2243 patients who did not undergo surgical resection
or for whom the status of surgical resection was unknown, 974
patients with stage IV disease, 17 patients with N2 disease, 231
patients who received neoadjuvant or unclassified treatment,
and 20 patients with missing data for node status.
Treatment of all cases was analyzed using pathological
stage (clinical stage was used if pathologic stage was missing)
at the time of diagnosis. Management strategies for GBC
include surgery, chemotherapy, RT, and combinations of these
modalities. Information retrieved included type of surgery
(local tumor excision, vs removal of gallbladder, vs removal of
gallbladder in continuity with other organs), age (categorized
as 18–49, 50–64, 65–79, �80 years), race/ethnicity (categorized
as non-Hispanic [NH] white, NH black, Hispanic, or other/
unknown), patient insurance (private, Medicaid, Medicare,
uninsured, or other/missing), facility type (community cancer
program, comprehensive community cancer program, teach-
ing/research center, National Cancer Institute [NCI] program),
facility volume (tertiles of facility case volume were ranked
into low, medium, and high case volume by counting the
number of cases treated at the facility by diagnosis year), geo-
graphical region of treatment facility (New England, Middle

gin negative, margin positive, unknown/other), and comorbid-
ity score (0, 1, � 2, based on the sum of weighted Charlson-Deyo
Score [14]). Adjuvant therapy was defined as any treatment
administered within six months after diagnosis. For the trend
analysis, all patients were grouped according to predetermined
time periods of diagnosis: 2005–2007, 2008–2010, 2011–2013. For
three-year survival analysis, data were limited to patients diag-
nosed with T1-3N0-1 GBC from 2005 to 2010 (n ¼ 2989).
Statistical Analysis
We used SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to per-
form the statistical analysis. We performed descriptive analysis
to show patterns of adjuvant treatment using chi-square tests to
test
statistical
significance
for
categorical
variables
and
Cochran-Armitage trend test to determine trends over time in
the use of adjuvant therapies for three time periods (2005–2007,
2008–2010, 2011–2013). Variables likely to be associated with
receipt of adjuvant treatments and the type of adjuvant treat-
ments were included in the multivariable logistic regression
model. All-cause unadjusted three-year survival rates were cal-
culated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Follow-up time for cal-
culating survival rates was from date of diagnosis until end-of-
study date (December 31, 2013), last contact date, or death,
whichever occurred first. Cox proportional hazards models
were used to estimate three-year risk of all-cause mortality and
identify independent predictors of survival. Diagnosis age, TN
category, grade, node status, comorbidity score, insurance sta-
tus, and income violated the supremum proportional hazards
assumption test and were included in strata statement of the
model. Treatment was included in the model although it vio-
lated proportional hazard assumption. Statistical significance
was considered when the two-sided P value was less than .05.
Results
Patient Demographics
There were no statistically significant differences in sociodemo-
graphic (age, ethnicity, insurance, income, or education) and
clinical characteristics (comorbidity score) of patients among
the three diagnosis periods (Table 1). The majority of patients
(65.6%) diagnosed with T1-3N0-1 GBC were age 65 years and
older. NH whites accounted for 63.1% of patients, and 63.8% had
a comorbidity score of 0.
Tumor Characteristics
The quality of documentation of tumor characteristics has
improved between the years of 2005 and 2013, with an apparent
decrease in missing information on margin status (P ¼ .04),
tumor size (P < .001), and in percent of patients with unexa-
mined
lymph
nodes
(P < .001).
No
statistically
significant
changes in tumor characteristics (T category, N category, grade)
were observed among the three diagnosis year cohorts (Table 1).
The overall distribution of patients by TN categories was as fol-
lows: 16.7% T1N0, 34.4% T2N0, 18.0% T3N0, and 30.9% T1-3N1.
Overall, 72.5% of patients who underwent surgery had margin-
negative resection.
Patterns of Treatment
The majority of patients were treated at comprehensive com-
munity cancer programs (45.4%) and NCI/teaching/research

 centers (35.0%). The proportion of patients treated at facilities
with low case volume status decreased from 39.7% during 2005–
2007 to 32.5% during 2011–2013 (Table 2). Surgery rarely con-
sisted of local tumor excision without gallbladder removal. The
proportion of patients who received no adjuvant therapy after
surgery for T1-3N0-1 trended down from 71.6% in years 2005–
2007 to 68.6% in years 2011–2013 (Ptrend ¼ .05). The proportion of
patients who received adjuvant RT following surgery decreased
from 4.2% in 2005–2007 to 1.7% in 2011–2013 (Ptrend< .001), with
no statistically significant relationship between the type of sur-
gery and the receipt of adjuvant RT (Supplementary Table 1,
available online). At the same time, the receipt of adjuvant che-
motherapy has increased from 8.3% to 13.8% (Ptrend < .001) while
receipt of adjuvant CRT remained stable at 15.9% through these
years (Ptrend ¼ .98) (Figure 1A).
Patterns of Adjuvant Treatment by TN Category
Very few patients with T1N0 (5.9%) received adjuvant therapy
after surgery, and this pattern did not change between 2005 and
2013 (Ptrend ¼ .98). Receipt of adjuvant therapies increased from
20.6% in 2005–2007 to 25.2% in 2011–2013 for patients with T2N0
disease (Ptrend ¼ .05). Adjuvant therapy was given to 38.5% of
patients with T3N0 disease and to 45.5% of patients with T1-
3N1 disease, with no statistically significant change across the
three time periods (Ptrend ¼ .87 and .08, respectively) (Figure 1B).
Factors Associated With Receipt of Adjuvant Treatments
Patients who were older and had higher comorbidity scores
were more likely not to receive any type of adjuvant therapy.
Advanced stage, larger primary tumor size, and involvement of
lymph nodes were associated with a higher likelihood of receiv-
ing some type of adjuvant therapy. Notably, regional differences
impacted the receipt of adjuvant therapies, but social factors
were not associated with adjuvant treatments (Table 3). Factors
that were associated with receipt of adjuvant chemoradiation
were younger age, being Hispanic, having a more advanced TN
category, having positive lymph nodes, being treated at low
case volume centers, as well as being treated in certain geo-
graphic regions (Supplementary Table 2, available online).

 Survival Outcomes
The three-year unadjusted all-cause survival rates were 38.7%
(95% CI ¼ 36.5 to 40.8), 43.0% (95% CI ¼ 38.4 to 47.5), 28.6% (95%
CI ¼ 23.3 to 34.1), and 36.5% (95% CI ¼ 27.2 to 45.8) among
patients who received surgery alone, adjuvant CRT, adjuvant
chemotherapy, and adjuvant RT, respectively (Figure 2). When
compared with patients who did not receive any type of adju-
vant treatments, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for risk of death at
three years was 0.47 for adjuvant CRT (95% CI ¼ 0.39 to 0.58),
0.77 for adjuvant chemotherapy (95% CI ¼ 0.61 to 0.97), and 0.63
for adjuvant RT (95% CI ¼ 0.44 to 0.92) (Table 4). Positive surgical
margin status carried more than twice the risk of death at three
years, with a hazard ratio of 2.13 (95% CI ¼ 1.81 to 2.50), when
compared with negative surgical margin status. By TN catego-
ries, unadjusted three-year all-cause survival rates for patients
undergoing no adjuvant therapies after surgery were as follows:
64.2% (95% CI ¼ 59.6 to 68.4) for T1N0, 46.8% (95% CI ¼ 43.1 to
50.3) for T2N0, 19% (95% CI ¼ 15.0 to 23.4) for T3N0, and 16.7%
(95% CI ¼ 13.6 to 20.2) for T1-3N1 (Table 5). Among patients who
underwent surgical margin-negative resection, the unadjusted
three-year all-cause survival rate was 47.1% (95% CI ¼ 44.5 to
49.5) in the absence of adjuvant therapies, whereas with surgi-
cal margin-positive resection this rate was 10.6% (95% CI ¼ 7.8 to
13.9). The hazard ratios of survival for individual TN categories
and margin status are listed in Table 6. Adjuvant CRT was asso-
ciated with improved survival in all categories, except T1N0,
and in patients with negative and positive margins.
Discussion
This analysis of the NCDB over the past decade demonstrated a
strong association between receipt of adjuvant therapies after

 GBC resection and three-year overall survival. These findings
validate older studies that analyzed large national data sets for
outcomes in patients treated for GBC until 2006 (3–7,15). Our
findings are also in line with a smaller contemporary retrospec-
tive series from 10 academic centers in the United States (16). In
our study, the lowest hazard ratio for death at three years was
associated with receipt of adjuvant CRT, although we did not
compare different adjuvant therapies against each other, due to
lack of statistical power. By category, adjuvant CRT was associ-
ated with better survival in all categories, except T1N0, where
the number of patients who received adjuvant therapies was
very low for any meaningful statistical analysis. The strong
association of adjuvant CRT with overall survival can be
explained by high risk of both local and distant disease recur-
rence in patients with even margin-negative resection of GBC.
Despite the published results of previous studies demonstrat-
ing association between improved survival and receipt of adju-
vant therapy in resected GBC, we found that the past decade has
not seen an increase in the utilization of adjuvant treatments in
these patients. In the absence of randomized data, physicians
must utilize evidence from large retrospective series to guide
medical decisions. Our group has published two analyses of the
SEER database, one in 2008 showing a strong association between
adjuvant RT and overall survival for patients with node-positive
or T2 or greater disease (3) and another in 2011 revealing a similar
association with adjuvant CRT in the same group of patients (6).
Two other groups have independently analyzed the SEER data-
base and likewise confirmed a strong association of adjuvant RT
with improved overall survival for patients with all stages, except
stage I (4,5). A recent publication based on NCDB analysis of
patients treated between 1998 and 2006 further confirmed the
importance of adjuvant CRT (7). Unfortunately, our analysis of
patterns of care shows no increase in utilization of adjuvant CRT
between 2005 and 2013, a decrease in use of adjuvant RT, and a
slight uptake of adjuvant chemotherapy over these years. The
majority of US patients with resected gallbladder cancer still do
not receive adjuvant therapies, even with locally advanced dis-
ease, such as T3N0 or T1-3N1, where three-year survival rates are
only 19% and 17%, respectively, with surgery alone. Current
NCCN guidelines may in part be responsible for the disconnect
between published results from large national databases and lack
of incorporation of this knowledge into clinical practice in the
United States, as the current guidelines endorse a choice between
observation, adjuvant chemotherapy, or adjuvant CRT, without
giving support for adjuvant therapies to practicing clinicians (8).
It is important to note that complete surgical resection
remains the only potentially curative treatment for primary
adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder. In our analysis, we excluded
patients who did not undergo surgery, but prior to exclusion we
noted that almost 30% of US patients over the past decade with
T1-3N0-1 disease were treated with nonsurgical modalities
(definitive CRT, RT alone, or supportive care). This indicates that
there may be a breakdown in referral for definitive surgery after
GBC is diagnosed. Whether this is due to an incidental diagnosis
of GBC made at cholecystectomy, comorbidities precluding major
hepatic resection, or lack of clinical experience and knowledge
regarding optimal surgical management of GBC among physi-
cians facing an uncommon diagnosis remains unclear. What is
known is that among patients who undergo curative resection,
only 70% of patients in our analysis had R0 resection. For the
remaining 30%, outcomes are poor, as patients had more than
twice the risk of death at three years. While adjuvant treatments
were associated with improved three-year all-cause survival
rates in patients with both positive and negative margins,
patients with negative margins and no adjuvant therapy had bet-
ter unadjusted three-year survival (47%) than patients with posi-
tive margins and adjuvant treatments (22%). Hence, no currently
available adjuvant therapy is able to make up for the presence of

 positive margins. Surprisingly, we did not observe a higher rate
of patients with positive margins over the past decade receiving
adjuvant treatments in our analysis.
When we explored the impact of individual adjuvant ther-
apy in our contemporary NCDB analysis, we found that adju-
vant chemotherapy alone was associated with improved OS
only in node-positive patients. A previous NCDB analysis of
patients treated until 2006 showed no benefit to adjuvant che-
motherapy (7), whereas the recent retrospective analysis from 10
academic US institutions evaluating patients treated between
2000 and 2015 revealed an association between adjuvant chemo-
therapy and overall survival in multivariable analysis (16). NCDB
does not collect information on the exact chemotherapy agents
that patients in the United States received in the adjuvant setting,
and it is possible that in the past patients were receiving chemo-
therapy that had limited activity in GBC. Indeed, a pooled analysis
of 104 chemotherapy trials involving 1368 biliary cancer patients
conducted in 1999–2006 suggested differences in clinical behavior
and responsiveness to chemotherapy between GBC and other bili-
ary tumors (17,18). Several phase II trials conducted in patients
with GBC revealed that gemcitabine-based regimens have activity
in this disease (18–20). Perhaps a higher proportion of patients

 receiving gemcitabine in the modern era may explain the appa-
rent difference between the NCDB analysis conducted in the old
era and our current findings.
There were statistically significant changes in the AJCC TNM
staging of GBC over the past decade (21). Individual definitions
for T-category and N-category were not as affected as the group-
ing into overall stages. For this reason, our NCDB analysis
focused on TN categories, which have not changed over the
past decade, and we explicitly avoided using overall AJCC
stages, which varied dramatically between 2005 and 2013 (data
not shown).
We did not find any association between patient-related
(such as insurance, income, race/ethnicity) or practice setting–
related (such as volume of patients seen at an institution) factors
and receipt of adjuvant therapies in our analysis, in contrast to
our recent findings among US patients with locally advanced rec-
tal cancer (22). This observation reinforces that medical knowl-
edge, or lack thereof, is at the core of current practice patterns in
the United States, and further research and education are critical
for changing the outcomes for patients with GBC.
The NCDB is a comprehensive national oncologic outcomes
database
with
detailed
information
on
sociodemographic,
tumor, hospital, and treatment characteristics (23). Several
comparison studies have documented the validity of NCDB-
based analysis (24,25). Despite these validation studies, several
limitations to the current study require discussion. Although
clinical and demographic characteristics of patients in the
NCDB have been shown to be similar with patients in the SEER
database (26), NCDB remains a hospital-based cancer registries
database and the results may not be generalizable to the US
population. Underreporting of receipt of chemotherapy and
radiation therapy may occur as these therapies can be adminis-
tered in the outpatient setting, which may make the data diffi-
cult to obtain. Additionally, NCDB does not collect information
on types or combinations of chemotherapy drugs, provider/
patient preferences, or individual socioeconomic factors that
could influence receipt of treatment and survival outcome.
Finally, we were unable to analyze GBC-specific mortality as the
NCDB does not collect this information, which may not be
reflective of treatment effectiveness but rather dependent on
patient selection and thus susceptible to selection bias.
In a large national database, we have shown that over the
past
decade
the
uptake
of
adjuvant
treatments
has
not
improved in the United States, and more than 70% of patients
do not receive adjuvant therapies. Further, the use of adjuvant
therapies,
particularly
adjuvant
CRT,
is
associated
with
improved overall survival for patients with resected GBC. In the
absence
of
randomized
data,
large
database
retrospective
cohort studies should be considered the foundation of current
standards of care. This study and those that preceded it will cer-
tainly inform future guidelines, so that clinicians would be
aware of a strong association between adjuvant therapies and
overall survival in patients with resected GBC.
