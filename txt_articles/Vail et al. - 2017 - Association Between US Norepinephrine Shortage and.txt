IMPORTANCE Drug shortages in the United States are common, but their effect on patient
care and outcomes has rarely been reported.
OBJECTIVE To assess changes to patient care and outcomes associated with a 2011 national
shortage of norepinephrine, the first-line vasopressor for septic shock.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of 26 US hospitals in the
Premier Healthcare Database with a baseline rate of norepinephrine use of at least 60% for
patients with septic shock. The cohort included adults with septic shock admitted to study
hospitals between July 1, 2008, and June 30, 2013 (n = 27 835).
EXPOSURES Hospital-level norepinephrine shortage was defined as any quarterly (3-month)
interval in 2011 during which the hospital rate of norepinephrine use decreased by more than
20% from baseline.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Use of alternative vasopressors was assessed and
a multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association
between admission to a hospital during a norepinephrine shortage quarter
and in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS Among 27 835 patients (median age, 69 years [interquartile range, 57-79 years];
47.0% women) with septic shock in 26 hospitals that demonstrated at least 1 quarter of
norepinephrine shortage in 2011, norepinephrine use among cohort patients declined from
77.0% (95% CI, 76.2%-77.8%) of patients before the shortage to a low of 55.7% (95% CI,
52.0%-58.4%) in the second quarter of 2011; phenylephrine was the most frequently used
alternative vasopressor during this time (baseline, 36.2% [95% CI, 35.3%-37.1%]; maximum,
54.4% [95% CI, 51.8%-57.2%]). Compared with hospital admission with septic shock during
quarters of normal use, hospital admission during quarters of shortage was associated with
an increased rate of in-hospital mortality (9283 of 25 874 patients [35.9%] vs 777 of 1961
patients [39.6%], respectively; absolute risk increase = 3.7% [95% CI, 1.5%-6.0%]; adjusted
odds ratio = 1.15 [95% CI, 1.01-1.30]; P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with septic shock in US hospitals affected by
the 2011 norepinephrine shortage, the most commonly administered alternative vasopressor
was phenylephrine. Patients admitted to these hospitals during times of shortage had higher
in-hospital mortality.

rug shortages are an increasing problem with poten-
tialeffectsonpatientsandhealthcaredeliverycosts.1,2
In the United States, the issue has received consider-
able attention from federal legislators, media, and physician
and pharmacist advocacy groups. However, the effects of drug
shortages on patient outcomes or on alternative prescribing
practices are poorly described.3-6 In addition, there is no na-
tional reporting system that captures hospital-level data on
drug shortages or their effect on patients.
In February 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) announced a severe nationwide shortage of norepi-
nephrine caused by production interruptions at 3 drug
manufacturers that persisted until February 2012.7 Because
norepinephrine is recommended as the first-line vasopressor
for treatment of hypotension due to septic shock,8 the
hypothesis was that admission to a hospital affected by the
norepinephrine shortage would be associated with increased
mortality in patients with septic shock. This question was
addressed using a large, nationally representative database
of hospitalized patients in the United States to assess the
associations between the norepinephrine shortage, use of
alternative vasopressors, and mortality among patients with
septic shock.
Methods
The study protocol was approved by the institutional re-
view boards of Columbia University Medical Center and
Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Each granted waivers of
informed consent. We conducted a retrospective analysis
of administrative and pharmacy billing data captured in the
Premier Healthcare Database between July 1, 2008, and
June 30, 2013.9-11 Premier data contain standard claims data
(eg, patient demographic characteristics, International Clas-
sification of Diseases codes) as well as detailed, date-indexed
logs of all services billed to patients or insurance, including
diagnostic tests, imaging, laboratory tests, and medications
(including dose and route). Premier Inc performs an iterative
data validation and audit process,12 returning missing or in-
valid data to source hospitals for correction prior to final data
validation and release; missing data are minimal.
Definition of Septic Shock
Patients with septic shock were defined as adults (aged ≥18
years) admitted to US acute care hospitals and meeting crite-
ria for severe sepsis using a previously validated algorithm
that uses a combination of International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes to identify a bacterial
or fungal infectious process and a diagnosis of acute organ
dysfunction,13,14 with the addition of use of any of 5 vaso-
pressors (norepinephrine, phenylephrine, dopamine, epi-
nephrine, and vasopressin) for 2 or more days during hos-
pital admission. Vasopressor use was defined as any daily
pharmacy charge for a given vasopressor. The cohort was
restricted to patients who received vasopressor treatment for
2 or more days to exclude patients with infection and organ
dysfunction who might have received brief infusions of vaso-
pressors for indications other than sepsis-induced shock
(eg, anesthesia-induced vasodilation). All hospitalizations
that met these criteria were included, as we were unable to
identify whether the same individual was hospitalized at dif-
ferent points in time using these data.
Definitions of Hospital Vasopressor Use
The study period was divided into quarter years (3-month pe-
riods), and the baseline period was defined as the first 8 quar-
ters of data (July 2008 through June 2010) (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement). Hospital-level vasopressor use was defined as
the proportion of patients with septic shock in each study hos-
pital who received the given vasopressor, alone or in combi-
nation with other vasopressor agents, in each study quarter.
We calculated baseline and quarterly rates of vasopressor use
and relative changes in quarterly use from baseline for each
study hospital.
Hospital Exclusions
We excluded low-volume hospitals (defined as those with
<500 septic shock admissions during the study period, or <5
septic shock admissions in any study quarter) to ensure that a
small change in the number of patients receiving norepi-
nephrine did not disproportionately affect observed hospital-
level rates of norepinephrine use. We excluded hospitals with
a baseline norepinephrine rate of less than 60% of patients
with septic shock to both maximize the number of hospitals
included and increase the likelihood that clinicians would
experience a shortage of the first-line vasopressor within
their hospital.
Primary Hospital Cohort
The possible norepinephrine shortage period in each hospital
was defined as the 4 quarters of calendar year 2011 (as re-
ported on the FDA’
s drug shortage website).7 To evaluate po-
tential factors and outcomes associated with the norepineph-
rine shortage, the primary analysis cohort focused on hospitals
with consistent use of norepinephrine before and after the
shortage, and with a reduction in norepinephrine use by more
than20%duringatleast1quarteroftheshortageperiod.These
characteristics were operationalized using 3 a priori criteria to
Key Points
Question Was there an association between the 2011 US
norepinephrine shortage and mortality among adults
with septic shock?
Findings In this cohort study of 27 835 patients with septic shock
admitted to 26 hospitals, phenylephrine use significantly
increased during 3-month periods of active norepinephrine
shortage. Compared with hospital admission with septic shock
during periods of normal use, admission during hospital periods of
shortage was associated with an increased rate of in-hospital
mortality (35.9% vs 39.6%, respectively).
Meaning The US norepinephrine shortage was significantly
associated with increased mortality among patients
with septic shock.

define shortage hospitals: (1) a relative decrease by more than
20% in norepinephrine use from baseline in at least 1 quarter
of 2011; (2) a return to norepinephrine use rates to within 10%
of the baseline rate by the second quarter of 2012; and (3) no
more than 1 quarter of norepinephrine use that was more than
20% below baseline before or after 2011.
Hospitals with norepinephrine use that did not decrease
by more than 20% in any quarter of 2011 were designated as
consistent-use hospitals and used for comparison with short-
age hospitals in a secondary difference-in-differences (DID)
analysis. Examples of temporal norepinephrine use patterns
among study hospitals meeting shortage and consistent-use
criteria are included in eFigure 2 in the Supplement, showing
individual hospital data from 2 hospitals. We excluded hospi-
tals not satisfying either set of inclusion criteria (unclassified
hospitals), for example, those with intermittent quarters of de-
creased norepinephrine use throughout the study period
(Figure 1).

association between race and outcomes for patients with
sepsis.16 We identified surgical admissions from ICD-9 proce-
dure codes for major diagnostic or therapeutic surgery
as classified by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project.17
Intensive care unit (ICU) admission was identified from hos-
pitalizationbedcharges.Hospital-levelvariablesincludednum-
berofhospitalbeds,USgeographicregion,teachingstatus,and
urban vs rural location.
Exposure and Outcomes
Individual patients were considered exposed to the norepi-
nephrine shortage if they were admitted to a hospital in 2011
during a quarter in which the hospital demonstrated at least
a 20% relative decrease in norepinephrine use compared
with its baseline rate. The primary outcome was in-hospital
mortality. The secondary outcome was the use of individual
vasopressors.
Statistical Analysis
Characteristics of cohort hospitals are described for the
shortage, consistent-use, and unclassified hospitals (eTable 1
in the Supplement). Patient characteristics were compared
for patients who received care in shortage hospitals during
identified shortage quarters vs patients in shortage hospitals
during nonshortage quarters and vs patients in consistent-
use hospitals, using means and standard deviations for para-
metric data and medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for
nonparametric data. Unadjusted between-group compari-
sons were performed using t, Wilcoxon rank sum, Kruskal-
Wallis, and χ2 tests as appropriate to compare patient charac-
teristics for patients in shortage hospitals in shortage vs
nonshortage quarters.
Vasopressor use rates (for each of 5 vasopressors) and in-
hospital mortality rates were plotted by study quarter for the
entire cohort, shortage hospitals, and consistent-use hospi-
tals. We assessed for trends over time in the entire cohort using
linear regression. To better assess use of other vasopressors
during the norepinephrine shortage, we correlated the rela-
tive change from baseline in quarterly use of norepinephrine
(in2011)andeachothervasopressorinshortagehospitalsusing
unadjusted multilevel linear regression with hospital as a ran-
dom effect to account for correlated observations.
The primary analysis evaluated the association between
admission during quarters of 2011 with 20% or greater rela-
tive decreases in norepinephrine use (the primary exposure,
as a dichotomous variable) and in-hospital mortality within
shortage hospitals. Multivariable mixed-effects logistic regres-
sion analysis was performed with hospital of admission as
a random intercept to account for clustering by hospital.18,19
Additional covariates included all individual patient and
hospital-level factors and year of hospital discharge to adjust
for temporal changes in norepinephrine use and in-hospital
mortality. The coefficient generated by this analysis de-
scribes the adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality attribut-
able to admission to a hospital with a quarterly lower-than-
expected rate of norepinephrine use during the period of
national shortage, while accounting for baseline differences
in mortality rates between hospitals.
To better account for secular effects, in particular the
possibility that the norepinephrine shortage period was asso-
ciated with transiently higher mortality at all hospitals, a DID
model was developed.20 This model included both shortage
hospitals and consistent-use hospitals (as controls). It com-
pared the difference in mortality in shortage hospitals
between identified quarters of shortage in 2011 and all other
study quarters (including quarters in 2011 not meeting short-
age criteria) with the difference in mortality in consistent-use
hospitals in quarters of 2011 vs other study years (indepen-
dent of individual hospital rates of norepinephrine use).
The DID estimator generated by the model represents the
effect on in-hospital mortality of receiving care in a shortage
hospital during a quarter of 2011 in which that hospital expe-
rienced a norepinephrine shortage, adjusted for secular
trends in in-hospital mortality in patients with septic shock.
As a negative control, the primary analysis was repeated but
with patients in the primary cohort of shortage hospitals who
met criteria for severe sepsis (ie, infection with organ dys-
function) but who did not receive vasopressors during the
hospital stay.
To further examine the association between norepineph-
rine shortage and in-hospital mortality, we conducted several
additional sensitivity analyses. Because of secular trends in
mortality, we excluded data from after the shortage (2012-
2013) and reran the primary and DID models using data from
preshortage quarters and shortage quarters. To examine the
stability of the results to alternative definitions of shortage
hospitals, we recategorized unclassified hospitals as shortage
hospitals if they met shortage hospital criteria using only the
preshortage and shortage quarters (n = 15). The models were
repeated excluding the patients who were transferred in from
other acute care hospitals as they may have had other vaso-
pressor exposure. The primary analysis was also repeated
using the cohort of nonsurgical patients who received vaso-
pressors for 1 or more days (vs ≥2 days in the primary analy-
sis) and then categorizing the primary exposure variable into
approximate tertiles of relative decreases in norepinephrine
use (≤25%, 26%-35%, and >35% from baseline) to assess for
an association with the severity of the shortage.
Giventhesizeofthedataset,resultswereevaluatedforboth
clinical and statistical significance (defined as P < .05 without
adjustment for multiple comparisons). All significance testing

hospitals were medium to large in size (19 of 26 hospitals
[73.1%] with ≥300 beds).
A total of 27 835 patients (median age, 69 years [IQR, 57-79
years]; 47.0% women) were admitted to shortage hospitals.
Among 1961 patients admitted to shortage hospitals during
shortage quarters (7.0%), the median age was 68 years (IQR,
57-79 years) (Table 2). Nearly all of these patients (1869 of 1961
[95.3%])wereadmittedtoanICU.Themedianlengthofthefirst
ICU stay was 6 days (IQR, 3-11 days) and the median length of
hospital stay was 13 days (IQR, 7-22 days). Characteristics were
similar to the patients admitted in nonshortage quarters.
Vasopressor Trends
Overall, norepinephrine use increased during the 5 years in
the entire cohort from 76.7% (95% CI, 75.7%-77.6%) in the
third quarter of 2008 to 80.0% (95% CI, 79.2%-80.9%) in the
second quarter of 2013 (P < .001) (eFigure 3 in the Supple-
ment). At baseline, norepinephrine was used by 78.5% (95%
CI, 78.2%-78.7%) of patients with septic shock, and there was
a detectable decrease in norepinephrine use during the short-
age period, with recovery in 2012. For consistent-use hospi-
tals, the mean baseline use of norepinephrine was 79.3%
(95% CI, 78.9%-79.6%) and was stable throughout 2011
(Figure 2A). For shortage hospitals, baseline norepinephrine
use was 77.0% (95% CI, 76.2%-77.8%) (Figure 2B). During the
shortage year (2011), quarterly norepinephrine use among
shortage hospitals decreased to a nadir of 55.7% (95% CI,
52.0%-58.4%) during the second quarter. Mean quarterly
phenylephrine use among the same hospitals increased
simultaneously from a baseline rate of 36.2% (95% CI, 35.3%-
37.1%) to a peak of 54.4% (95% CI, 51.8%-57.2%) in the sec-
ond quarter of 2011. At the level of the individual shortage
hospital in 2011, there was a moderate inverse correlation
between the relative change in quarterly use of norepineph-
rine vs phenylephrine (β = −1.18 [95% CI, −1.55 to −0.81];
P < .001) and dopamine (β = −0.59 [95% CI, −0.84 to −0.34];
P < .001), and no significant correlation between changes in
use of norepinephrine vs vasopressin (β = −0.61 [95% CI,
−1.39 to 0.17]; P = .13) or epinephrine (β = −0.71 [95% CI,
−1.46 to 0.04]; P = .06) (eFigure 4 in the Supplement).
Association Between Norepinephrine Shortage
and In-Hospital Mortality
Overall, in-hospital mortality decreased in shortage hospitals
during the 5 years assessed, from 34.9% (95% CI, 32.2%-
37.5%) in the third quarter of 2008 to 31.9% (95% CI, 29.5%-
34.3%) in the second quarter of 2013 (P < .001) (Figure 3).
Compared with hospital admission with septic shock during
quarters of normal norepinephrine use, admission to short-
age hospitals during quarters of 2011 in which relative norepi-
nephrine use decreased by 20% or more was associated with
increased odds of in-hospital mortality (9283 of 25 874
patients [35.9%] vs 777 of 1961 patients [39.6%], respectively;
absolute mortality difference = 3.7% [95% CI, 1.5%-6.0%];
adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.15 [95% CI, 1.01-1.30]; P = .03)

of patients with severe sepsis who did not require vasopres-
sors, there was no significant association between admission
duringashortagequarterandin-hospitalmortality(Table3and
eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Assessment of the primary cohort of shortage hospitals,
excluding hospitalizations after the shortage period (when
in-hospital mortality was the lowest) yielded similar esti-
mates, as did the DID model (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Many of the unclassified hospitals (n = 15) were excluded
because of continued low use of norepinephrine in 2012
(eFigure 5 in the Supplement). Regrouping of these unclassi-
fied hospitals as shortage hospitals also yielded a very simi-
lar estimate, as did exclusion of patients transferred in from
other acute care hospitals (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Analysis of nonsurgical patients who received vasopressors
for 1 or more days did not show a significant increase in
mortality. When assessed as tertiles of relative decrease
in norepinephrine use from baseline as a measure of severity
of the shortage, adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality were
significantly increased only for the group of patients admit-
ted to shortage hospitals with rates of decreased norepi-
nephrine use in quarters of 2011 in the middle tertile (repre-
senting relative decreases of 26%-35% in norepinephrine
use) (AOR = 1.29 [95% CI, 1.07-1.56]; P = .007) (eTable 5 in
the Supplement).
Discussion
This study demonstrates changes in patterns of use of vaso-
pressors for patients with septic shock in selected hospitals
during the period of norepinephrine shortage in the United
States. The decreased use of norepinephrine during periods
of shortage was associated with an increase in use of phenyl-
ephrine. Receipt of care in a hospital experiencing a norepi-
nephrine shortage was associated with an increased rate of
in-hospital mortality (3.7% increase, from 35.9% to 39.6%).
The use of national patient-level data is a strength of the
study, as most existing evidence of the effect of shortages on
patient care comes from clinician surveys, government re-
ports, and single-center observational studies.4,5,21 The ap-
proach of a hospital-level exposure also reduces the possibil-
ity of confounding by indication; the results were robust to
multiple sensitivity analyses, and the inclusion of a “nega-
tive” control (patients with severe sepsis but without a re-
quirement for vasopressors) showing no significant associa-
tion of care in hospitals experiencing the norepinephrine
shortage and increased mortality also strengthens the find-
ings. Placing these findings in the context of an estimated
150 000 deaths from sepsis in the United States each year,22,23
the norepinephrine shortage observed in 17% of hospitals
may have been associated with hundreds of excess deaths.

all hospitals in the United States could result in thousands of
additional deaths in a year. However, these estimates are based
on assumptions that the point estimate represents the true ef-
fect size and that the entire difference is causal with no con-
founding, both of which are speculative.
Several factors may explain the observed associations
between norepinephrine shortage and increased patient mor-
tality. First, other specific vasopressors selected to replace
norepinephrine may result in worse outcomes for patients
with septic shock. In this study, phenylephrine use increased
the most during the norepinephrine shortage. There are
fewer data comparing outcomes between patients treated
with phenylephrine vs norepinephrine in septic shock.24,25
Concerns about increased ventricular afterload in the setting
of myocardial dysfunction inform the Surviving Sepsis Cam-
paign guidelines, which in 2008 (most relevant to the care
of the patients in this study) did not recommend use of
phenylephrine.8 Moreover, dopamine (the other vasopressor
that increased most with the decrease in norepinephrine use)
is described in the most recent guidelines as a vasopressor
that should be used “as an alternative vasopressor agent to
norepinephrine only in highly selected patients”26 based on
conclusions of a meta-analysis assessing studies comparing
norepinephrine vs dopamine in septic shock.
Another possible explanation for the observed associa-
tion with mortality is that observable decreases in norepi-
nephrine use in the setting of shortage may be a marker of re-
latedunmeasuredfactorsthataffectedpatientoutcomes.These
could include the absence of a dedicated shortage pharma-
cist to optimize distribution of limited supplies, delayed ad-
ministrationofvasopressors,orlackofclinicianfamiliaritywith
dosing and titration of alternative vasopressor agents.
This study has a number of limitations. First, the specific
criteria to identify shortage hospitals required specification of
cutoffs to determine the presence or absence of a shortage.
Some hospitals (22 of the 150 hospitals [14.7%]) could not be
classified as either shortage hospitals or consistent-use hos-
pitals. There was limited ability to determine why some hos-
pitals appeared to experience a shortage, while others did not.
Defining a shortage in terms of decreased number of patients
and days of drug use likely underestimates the number of pa-
tients and hospitals affected by the 2011 norepinephrine short-
age. These methods may not capture hospitals that experi-
enced shortage but used alternative options to compensate
(eg, capping doses in patients to extend available supplies, re-
ducing use in the operating room to ensure availability for the
ICUs); such events could result in underattribution of the nor-
epinephrine shortage to outcomes. Although the 2011 norepi-
nephrine shortage was unique among vasoactive drug short-
ages in its duration and severity, US drug manufacturers
reported a brief concurrent shortage of phenylephrine (late
April to June 2011) and reduced inventory of vasopressin due
to interruption of production at some plants in 2011,7 al-
though the data in the present study did not show a decrease
in overall use during these periods.
There is the possibility of residual confounding from un-
identified differences between hospitals with and without pe-
riods of decreased norepinephrine use associated with short-
age, and between patients admitted who did or did not receive
norepinephrine during the shortage period. In particular, the
data did not include a physiology-based severity-of-illness
score for patients, did not allow for identification of specific
clinical decision making leading to selection of norepineph-
rine for individual patients, and did not include information
on dosage or actual duration during a 24-hour period. The use
of administrative data and the definition by Angus and
colleagues13 for patients with severe sepsis is an ICD-9–based
approach to defining sepsis and may or may not identify pa-
tients who would meet the criteria for sepsis based on the most
recent clinical definition.27 The cohort of patients was also lim-
ited to those who received vasopressors for 2 or more days and
excludedpatientswhodiedonthefirstdayofvasopressortreat-
ment. This study did not demonstrate a dose-response asso-
ciation between hospital quarters with greater relative reduc-
tions in norepinephrine use and increased mortality. This may
be due to a threshold effect of vasopressor shortage on mor-
tality or lack of power due to relatively few hospital quarters
at the extreme levels of vasopressor shortage. Also, the limi-
tation of in-hospital mortality means that the results may have
underestimated mortality, particularly for hospitals that tend
to transfer patients early to other skilled care facilities.28
Conclusions
Among patients with septic shock in US hospitals affected by
the 2011 norepinephrine shortage, the most commonly ad-
ministered alternative vasopressor was phenylephrine. Pa-
tients admitted to these hospitals during times of shortage had
higher in-hospital mortality.
