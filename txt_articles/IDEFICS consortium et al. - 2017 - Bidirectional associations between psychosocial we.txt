Abstract
Background: In children the relationship between a healthy diet and psychosocial well-being has not been fully
explored and the existing evidence is inconsistent. This study investigates the chronology of the association
between children’s adherence to healthy dietary guidelines and their well-being, with special attention to the
influence of weight status on the association.
Methods: Seven thousand six hundred seventy five children 2 to 9 years old from the eight-country cohort study
IDEFICS were investigated. They were first examined between September 2007 and June 2008 and re-examined
again 2 years later. Psychosocial well-being was measured using self-esteem and parent relations questions from
the KINDL® and emotional and peer problems from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. A Healthy Dietary
Adherence Score (HDAS) was calculated from a 43-item food frequency questionnaire as a measure of the degree
to which children’s dietary intake follows nutrition guidelines. The analysis employed multilevel logistic regression
(country as random effect) with bidirectional modeling of dichotomous dietary and well-being variables as both
exposures and outcomes while controlling for respective baseline values.
Results: A higher HDAS at baseline was associated with better self-esteem (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0;1.4) and fewer
emotional and peer problems (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1;1.3 and OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2;1.4) 2 years later. For the reversed
direction, better self-esteem was associated with higher HDAS 2 years later (OR 1.1 95% CI 1.0;1.29). The analysis
stratified by weight status revealed that the associations between higher HDAS at baseline and better well-being
at follow-up were similar in both normal weight and overweight children.
Conclusion: Present findings suggest a bidirectional relation between diet quality and self-esteem. Additionally,
higher adherence to healthy dietary guidelines at baseline was associated with fewer emotional and peer
problems at follow-up, independent of children’s weight status.

 Background
In 2005 the Mental Health Foundation recognized diet
as an underestimated determinant of mental health [1].
Studies have found both suppression of negative emo-
tions and inability to withstand negative emotions to be
associated with excessive food intake, particularly of
foods rich in fat and sugar, often considered comfort
foods [2, 3]. Furthermore, emotional state may influence
taste: stress or negative emotions have been reported to
diminish sweet taste and enhance sour taste while the
opposite was found for positive emotions [4]. Macht el
al have suggested a bidirectional relationship where
emotions regulate eating, and eating regulates emotions
[5]. This theory was further advanced by Singh et al.
who suggested a cycle of negative emotions leading to
excess intake of comfort foods which in time leads to
obesity that furthers the negative emotional state due to
metabolic disturbances [6].
In children the evidence for an association between
diet and psychosocial well-being is limited and inconsist-
ent. In one study, high intake of sugar-rich foods was as-
sociated with higher odds of emotional problems, while
higher diet quality (low in fat but high in plant foods)
was associated with lower odds of emotional problems
[7]. Similarly, energy-dense and nutrient-poor diets were
cross-sectionally
associated
with
hyperactivity-
inattention disorders and conduct/opposition disorders,
while a diverse diet rich in plant foods and fish was asso-
ciated
with
lower
odds
of
having
psychiatric
and
hyperactivity-inattention disorders [8]. Recently a review
by O’Neil et al. found consistent evidence of a cross-
sectional association between unhealthy diets (generally
including refined grains, processed meat and snacks,
diet- and sugar rich soft drinks, fried food and foods
high in saturated fat and sugar) and poor psychosocial
well-being in children and adolescents [9]. Little is
known about the longitudinal relation between diet and
behavioral problems in children, although one study [10]
found no associations between high intakes of processed
snack foods and other foods high in fat and/or sugar in
relation
to
behavioural
problems
16
months
later.
However, one has to acknowledge the possible effect of
children’s weight status on the association between diet
and psychosocial well-being [6, 11]. For example, recent
results from the IDEFICS (Identification and Prevention
of Dietary- and Lifestyle-Induced Health Effects in
Children and Infants study) suggests that childhood
overweight increases the risk of poor health-related
quality of life while poor well-being increases the risk of
developing overweight [12].
There is a lack of prospective research investigating
the link between food intake and psychosocial well-
being in children. More specifically, the association be-
tween healthy dietary intake and children’s well-being
needs to be confirmed and investigated for chronology
and potential causality. Hence, the primary aim of this
study is to investigate the bidirectional association be-
tween adherence to healthy dietary guidelines and chil-
dren’s psychosocial well-being and the extent to which
these associations might differ between children with
different weight status.
Methods
Participants
The present study includes children from the Identifica-
tion and Prevention of Dietary- and Lifestyle-Induced
Health Effects in Children and Infants study (IDEFICS).
IDEFICS is a prospective cohort study with an embed-
ded intervention, including eight European countries
(Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Italy,
Spain and Sweden). The general purpose of IDEFICS is
to understand how to prevent overweight in children
while considering its multifactorial etiology. Ethics ap-
proval was obtained from review boards responsible in
each country. Parents provided written informed con-
sent, and children gave oral consent for examinations
and sample collection. Further information about the
IDEFICS study can be obtained from previous publica-
tions [13, 14].
Originally, 16,228 children aged 2 to 9 years participated
at IDEFICS baseline (September 2007 to June 2008). The
baseline survey was followed by a community intervention
in half of the sample and then a 2 years follow-up examin-
ation was conducted in 9920 children from the original
baseline cohort. The prospective design required that the
same instruments and examinations were employed at
both time points. To assure quality and comparability
across research centers a translation/back-translation for
each local language was performed, together with a re-
administration to a sub-sample for assessing reliability
[13]. Data on diet and indicators of well-being were ob-
tained by parental proxy reporting using questionnaires.
Only children with complete data on diet and indicators of
well-being from both time points were included, hence the
final sample consisted of 7675 children, 51% males (Fig. 1).
The healthy dietary adherence score (HDAS)
An a priori diet score, the Healthy Dietary Adherence
Score (HDAS), was calculated from a 43-item food fre-
quency questionnaire (FFQ). At baseline and follow-up
parents (or other caregivers) were asked to report the
usual consumption frequency in a typical week during
the preceding 4 weeks for all meals consumed at home
or in the presence of the parents excluding e.g. foods
served at school: In the last month, how many times
did your child eat or drink the following food items?
Possible options for answering were: never/less than
once a week, 1–3 times a week, 4–6 times a week, 1 time
Arvidsson et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:926 
Page 2 of 11
 per day, 2 times per day, 3 times per day, 4 or more
times per day, I have no idea. Children for whom more
than 21 (50%) of the FFQ items were missing were ex-
cluded. Based on this definition the rate of complete
FFQ (less than 50% of food items missing) were 93% at
both baseline and follow-up. In the remaining sample
of children the missing food items as well as the answer
‘I have no idea’ were treated as not consumed when
creating composite scores. This is a common practice
in nutrition surveys because food items are often left
blank if not consumed [15–17]. A pilot study found the
FFQ to be reproducible with mean Kappa coefficients
ranging from 0.41 to 0.60 and Spearman’s correlation
higher than 0.5 for 81% of the food items [18]. Further,
a validation study against repeated 24-h dietary recall
found that under 12% of the food groups were classified
in the wrong quartile of intake [19].
The HDAS was developed to reflect the guidelines
established by Waijers et al. [20, 21]. Specifically, the
HDAS aimed to capture adherence to healthy dietary
guidelines common for all eight countries participating
in the IDEFICS study. Moreover, the design of the
HDAS allows for a standardization of number of foods
and beverages reported, and consumption frequency, in
order to avoid misclassification of children into low or
high adherence just because they consume all types of
food frequently. The guidelines included: limit the intake
of refined sugars, reduce fat intake, especially of satu-
rated fat, choose whole meal when possible, consume
400–500 g of fruits & vegetables per day and fish 2–3
times per week. Hence, the HDAS contains five compo-
nents: sugar, fat, whole meal, fruits & vegetables, and
fish. Each component has a minimum score of 0 and a
maximum score of 10, summed to a maximum score of
50, where the highest score indicates the highest possible
adherence to the dietary guidelines. Both the HDAS and
its components were dichotomized into “lower adher-
ence” and “higher adherence” at the group median with
the median included in the higher adherence group. A
more detailed description of the HDAS can be found in
Additional file 1.
Indicators of psychosocial well-being
Four indicators of psychosocial well-being (referred to as
well-being) were examined at baseline and follow-up,
namely self-esteem, parent relations, emotional and peer
problems. Self-esteem and parent relations were calcu-
lated from responses to the validated Kinder Lebensquali-
tät Fragebogen (KINDL®) [22–24]. The IDEFICS study
included a version of the KINDL® developed for parent re-
sponse on behalf of children and adolescents between 7
and 17 years of age. The self-esteem score included: Dur-
ing the last week my child… (1) had fun and laughed a lot,
(2) didn’t feel much like doing anything, (3) felt alone, and
(4) felt scared or unsure of him/herself. The parent rela-
tions score included: During the last week my child… (1)
got on well with us as parents, (2) felt fine at home, (3) we
quarreled at home, and (4) felt that I was bossing him/her
around. The items were scored from 1 (never) to 4 (often
or always) with reversals according to the wording of the
question, summed to total scores and transformed to per-
centage scores ranging from 0 to 100%. The total scores
where then dichotomized into ‘poor’ or ‘good’ using sex-
and age-specific cut-off scores from the KINDL® manual
[22]. However, self-esteem was later re-categorized into
‘lower’ and ‘better’ scores at the group median since a ma-
jority of the children (98% at baseline and 97% at follow-
up) reported ‘good’ scores suggesting that our population
experienced higher self-esteem compared to the reference
population of corresponding sex- and age-groups.
Emotional and peer problems were calculated from
Goodmann et al.’s validated Strengths and Difficulties
Questionnaire (SDQ) [25–27] developed for children
ages 4 to 16 years. The IDEFICS study used the
informant-rated version which has been found to correl-
ate well with the child-rated version [27, 28]. The peer
problem score included: To what extent do the following
characterizations apply to your child? (1) rather solitary,
tends to play alone, (2) has at least one good friend, (3)
generally liked by other children (4) picked on or bullied
by other children, and (5) gets on better with adults than
with other children. The emotional problem score in-
cluded: To what extent do the following characterizations
apply to your child? (1) often complains of headaches,
stomach-aches or sickness, (2) many worries or often
seems worried, (3) often unhappy, depressed or tearful,

 (4) nervous in new situations, easily loses confidence, and
(5) many fears, easily scared. Items were scored from 0
‘not true’ to 2 ‘certainly true’ and summed to total scores
ranging from 0 to 10 where a high value indicated more
difficulties or life struggles. In accordance with the SDQ
manual [28] the emotional and peer problem scores
were
divided
into:
‘inconspicuous’
, ‘borderline’
and
‘abnormal’. Thereafter, a dichotomized variable was
created, as previously done by Hunsberger et al. [12],
consisting of poor well-being (including both ‘borderline’
and ‘abnormal’ groups) versus the remaining children
with no detectable (‘inconspicuous’) poor wellbeing.
Covariates
Measured anthropometrics were collected at both baseline
and follow-up. Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg
with a Tanita BC 420 SMA scale and height was measured
to the nearest 0.1 cm by a SECA 225 Stadiometer. Exami-
nations were conducted in the morning, with the children
fasting and in light clothing. Body Mass Index (BMI) and
age-and sex specific BMI z-scores and cut-points for chil-
dren and adolescents developed by the International
Obesity Task Force (IOTF) [29] were calculated and used
to categorize children as normal weight (including thin)
or overweight (including obese).
Data on parental education and income was collected
from the parental questionnaire. The education level is
based on the International Standard Classification of
Education (ISCED) for cross-country comparability and
was used to determine the highest level of either parents’
education [30]. Levels 1–3 represent upper secondary
education (classified as lower education level) and levels
4–6 represent post-secondary education (classified as
higher education level). Country-specific income levels
were assigned with reference to the average net equiva-
lence income, considering the median income and pov-
erty line. Levels 1–5 represent lower income level and
levels 6–9 represent higher income level.
Statistics
Descriptive
characteristics are presented as mean,
standard
deviation,
minimum
and
maximum
for
continuous variables (age, BMI z-score, indicators of
well-being and the HDAS scores), and number and
percentage for categorical variables (sex of the child,
weight status, SEP, and categories of well-being, HDAS
and its components). Due to the hierarchical structure
of
the
data
Generalized
Linear
Mixed
Models
(GENLINMIXED) were used to analyze the prospect-
ive association between higher adherence to the HDAS
and its components at baseline and indicators of well-
being 2 years later. Random intercepts for country
were included to consider the clustered study design.
The model was adjusted for age, sex, BMI z-score,
baseline well-being, and highest parental education
and income. To investigate directionality, associations
between well-being at baseline and adherence to the
HDAS and its components 2 years later were analyzed
using the same procedure, now adjusting for baseline
diet factors.
A sensitivity analysis was performed to further ex-
plore the chronology of associations between the
HDAS and well-being. In these analyses, group me-
dians were used as cut-off for the indicators of well-
being (as both exposure and outcome) to estimate
standardized effect sizes in both directions. The rela-
tionship with parents was dichotomized into ‘lower’
and ‘higher’ scores (median included in the higher
group), with a higher score indicating higher well-
being. Furthermore, emotional and peer problems were
dichotomized into ‘lower’ and ‘higher’ scores (median
included in the lower group), and here a lower score
indicated higher well-being. As previously described,
self-esteem was already dichotomized based on group
median. An additional sensitivity analysis using quar-
tiles of adherence to the HDAS was performed in
order to further explore the potential dose-response
relationship between baseline diet and children’s sub-
sequent well-being.
Next, stratified analyses were performed to investi-
gate if the association between diet and well-being dif-
fered between children with overweight compared to
children with normal weight. Finally, a drop-out ana-
lysis was conducted to compare children included in
the present study with those who only participated in
the IDEFICS baseline measurements. Student t-test
was used for continuous variables (age, BMI z-score,
the HDAS) and Pearson’s χ2-test to compare categor-
ical variables (sex of the child, parental education, par-
ental income, weight status, indicators of well-being).
All analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics
Version 20. The significance level was set to 0.05.
Results
As presented in Table 1, the analytic sample contained
a similar number of boys and girls. At baseline, the
mean age was 6.0 (±1.8) and the mean BMI z-score
was 0.3 (±0.3). On a group level, the Healthy Dietary
Adherence Score (HDAS) and all indicators of well-
being were stable between baseline and follow-up.
However,
the
prevalence
of
overweight
(including
obesity) in these children increased from 18% to 23%
during the two-year follow up, according to the criteria
of Cole et al. [29]. Finally, at baseline 59% of the
children had parents’ with post-secondary education
and 52% of the children had parents with an income

 above the country-specific median (based on centrally
calculated national statistics from each country).
Associations between baseline diet and well-being at
follow-up
Table 2 presents the results from the multilevel analysis
with higher versus lower well-being as the outcome.
Higher HDAS at baseline was associated with higher
self-esteem (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0;1.4) and fewer emotional
or peer problems (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1;1.3 and OR 1.3,
95% CI 1.2;1.4) 2 years later. Further analyses of the
components included in the HDAS identified positive
associations between baseline consumption of fruits &
vegetables, fish, whole meal and fat in accordance with
dietary guidelines and indicators of well-being 2 years
later.
Associations between baseline well-being and diet at
follow-up
The analysis was then repeated to study adherence to
healthy dietary guidelines as the outcomes, measured by
the HDAS and its components (Table 3). The fully ad-
justed model identified better self-esteem to be associ-
ated with higher HDAS 2 years later (OR 1.1, 95% CI
1.0;1.3). Additional analysis of the components included
in the HDAS found positive associations between base-
line indicators of well-being and consumption of fruits
& vegetables, sugar and fat in accordance with dietary
guidelines 2 years later.

 Results from the sensitivity analysis using group me-
dian as cut-off for the indicators of well-being did not
identify any further bidirectional associations (results
not shown). Since self-esteem was already dichotomized
based on group median the bidirectional association pre-
viously
established
between
self-esteem
and
HDAS
remained unchanged.
Sensitivity analysis
The dichotomization of the Healthy Dietary Adherence
score into “lower adherence” and “higher adherence” at
the group median was a subjective decision since no
clinical cut-off exists for what would define an adequate
adherence to these guidelines. However, to further ex-
plore the association between baseline diet and chil-
dren’s well-being at follow-up, a sensitivity analysis was
performed using quartiles of adherence to the HDAS.
Although no clear dose-response relation could be iden-
tified there was a monotonic trend in the odds of having
better well-being for higher adherence to the HDAS. In
comparison to children in the lowest quartile (i.e. lowest
adherence to the HDAS), children in the highest quartile
had 1.2 times higher odds of reporting better self-
esteem, 1.4 times higher odds of reporting less emo-
tional problems and 1.3 times higher odds of reporting
good peer relations.
Prospective associations across weight groups
As presented in Table 4, higher adherence to the
HDAS at baseline was associated with fewer emo-
tional and peer problems (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1;1.4 and
1.3, 95% CI 1.1;1.4) in the group of children with
normal weight (n = 5948). Further, among the group
of children with overweight (n = 1727) a higher adher-
ence to the HDAS was associated with fewer peer
problems (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1–1.7). For the reversed
direction, i.e. baseline well-being and diet at follow-up, no
significant associations were found either in the normal
weight or overweight group (Tables 5 and 6).

 Drop-out analysis
A drop-out analysis was conducted to compare children
who remained in the study (N = 7675) and children who
were lost to follow-up (N = 8553). As previously reported
from the IDEFICS study [31] children who attended
follow-up examinations had a lower prevalence of over-
weight (18 vs. 21% p < 0.001) and were more likely to be
from families with higher parental education (61 vs. 58%
p < 0.001) and have parents with higher income (52 vs.
38%). Additionally, they were more likely to have better
self-esteem (98 vs. 86% p < 0.001) and good parent rela-
tions (51 vs. 42%), and had fewer emotional (86 vs. 85%
p < 0.01) and peer problems (81 vs. 76% p < 0.001).
Compared to the children who dropped out, the contin-
ued participants had a somewhat higher total HDAS (22
(8.9) vs. 21.3 (8.9) p < 0.001). There was no difference in
age or sex of the children between the two groups.
Discussion
In this study we documented a bidirectional association
between adherence to healthy dietary guidelines and
children’s self-esteem. Furthermore, prospective associa-
tions were found between higher Healthy Dietary Adher-
ence Score (HDAS) at baseline and less emotional and
peer problems at follow-up. These associations could
not be explained by children’s weight status. These
findings are unique in that they are based on a large lon-
gitudinal study of children from different parts of Eur-
ope,
adding
to
the
largely
cross-sectional,
current
evidence on diet and psychosocial health in children [9].
Associations between baseline diet and well-being at
follow-up
The associations between higher adherence to the HDAS
and better well-being in children support previously re-
ported connections between diet and mental health in
adolescent populations [8, 32, 33]. Prospective associa-
tions between diet quality and mental health were re-
ported by Jacka et al. [32]. They found that increased
diet quality was associated with improved mental health
during a 3-year follow-up, while a decrease in diet qual-
ity was followed by a decline in mental health (measured
using the emotional subscale of the Pediatric Quality of
Life Inventory) [32]. In contrast to our findings, no
bidirectional association was identified by Jacka et al., i.e.
no significant association was found between mental
health status at baseline and diet quality 3 years later
[32]. Further, Kulkarni et al. reported independent
effects of healthy and unhealthy diets on adolescent
mental health, which is important because, as stated by
the author, “an increase in one of these behaviors is not
necessarily indicative of a decrease in the other” [33].
Some evidence exists that dietary interventions improve

 symptoms of depression [34]. However, a recent study
by Kaseva et al. reported no difference in psychological
well-being at the age of 20 in participants (as compared
to
controls)
after
a
repeated
dietary
and
lifestyle
intervention [35].
This study is unique in that associations between compo-
nents of the HDAS and well-being were explored. Fruit &
vegetable consumption according to guidelines (400–500 g
per day) was associated with all indicators of good well-
being; fish intake according to the guidelines (2–3 times
per week) was associated with better self-esteem and no
emotional or peer problems; and finally, intake of whole
meal according to guidelines was associated with no peer
problems. These findings reflect the dietary recommenda-
tions for the prevention of depression in adults that were
recently published by Opie et al. [36] and suggest that
these foods could be important for psychosocial well-being
in younger populations. Since the indicators of well-being
are measures of coping responses to external stressors like
e.g. demand, challenges or events [37] the present findings
could indicate that a healthy diet is an important factor for
coping ability in children.
These findings are fully consistent with current know-
ledge and assumptions that children’s physical and men-
tal development is dependent on nutritional quality [38].
Moreover, by categorizing children into quartiles of ad-
herence to the HDAS we identified a monotonic trend
in the odds of having better well-being. Although it is
beyond the scope of the present study to draw any con-
clusions about the mechanism(s) that links diet and
well-being one could hypothesize the biological signifi-
cance of omega-3 fatty acids and the micronutrient
content of the diet may positively impact mental health
[39, 40]. Additionally, one should consider the import-
ance of a healthy diet pattern on other lifestyle factors
such as e.g. dental health [41], and sleep [42, 43] and
that the association between diet and well-being might
reflect an overall good health in these children.
Associations between baseline well-being and diet at
follow-up
Among adult populations studies suggest that depression
as well as negative emotions and inability to withstand
negative emotions are associated with consumption of
foods rich in fat and sugar [2, 3, 44]. Furthermore,
depression has been associated with lower consumption
of fruits and vegetables [45]. To date, the prospective
effect of psychosocial well-being on dietary intake in chil-
dren
has
hardly
been
investigated.
Previous
cross-
sectional studies have related poor mental health to poor
eating habits [9] such as high intake of fast food, fried food
and lower intake of vegetables [46]. Additionally, a previ-
ous study by Michels et al. identified a cross-sectional as-
sociation between behavioral problems in children and
frequent consumption of foods rich in fat and sugar [47].
The present study adds to the existing literature in that
we identified a prospective association between better
self-esteem at baseline and a healthier diet at follow-up.
Furthermore, associations were established between base-
line indicators of well-being and components included in
the HDAS; better self-esteem at baseline was associated
with sugar intake in accordance with the guidelines
(limited intake of refined sugars); good parent relations
was associated with fruit & vegetable
consumption
according to guidelines (400–500 g per day); fewer emo-
tional problems was associated with fat intake according
to the guidelines (reduced intake, especially of saturated
fat); and finally fewer peer problems was associated with
consumption of fruits & vegetables according to guideline-
s.Previous findings of poor well-being relating to un-
healthy eating [9, 46, 47] could be due to the fact that
emotional eating is a coping mechanism [48] and that the
previously reported change in taste (where negative emo-
tions diminish sweet taste while enhancing sour taste) [4]
might affect food choices. In the present study the focus
was on healthy eating habits and the positive associations
found between baseline well-being and adherence to a
healthy diet at follow-up could reflect the fact that chil-
dren with better well-being have less need of food as a
coping mechanism. However, it is important to consider
the chronology of the associations identified. Bidirectional
associations were found between children’s self-esteem
and the HDAS. However, the effect estimates were similar
for both directions: a higher HDAS at baseline was associ-
ated with 1.2 times higher odds ratio of better self-esteem,
and conversely, better self-esteem at baseline was associ-
ated with 1.1 higher odds of a higher HDAS. This could

 indicate a possible positive reinforcement of a healthy diet
on higher self-esteem and vice versa. Although these esti-
mates were not significantly different, a general observa-
tion in the present study was more frequent associations
between baseline diet and psychosocial well-being at
follow-up rather than the reverse.
The effect of weight status on the association between
diet and well-being
Children with overweight and obesity constitute a vulner-
able group when it comes to psychosocial well-being due
to the frequent stigmatization because of their excess
weight [49, 50]. These children are to a higher extent
subject to bullying as compared to children with normal
weight
[51].
The
Longitudinal
Study
of
Australian
Children (LSAC) identified poor psychosocial health
(specifically regarding social and emotional functioning)
among children with overweight [52]. Similarly, recent re-
sults from the IDEFICS study indicates that children with
overweight are at higher risk of developing poor health re-
lated quality of life [12]. Therefore, the present finding of
an association between higher adherence to the HDAS at
baseline and better peer relations 2 years later independ-
ent of children’s weight status is an encouraging finding.
Strengths and limitations
Our study adds to the existing literature in that we were
able to examine the association between adherence to
healthy dietary guidelines and indicators of well-being in
a large European study of children during a two-year
follow-up using the same measures. However, this study
is not without limitations. In line with other prospective
studies our drop-out analysis identified a selective non-
participation at follow-up. The fact that children with
poor diet and poor well-being were under-represented
makes conclusion about prevalence or incidence prob-
lematic. Nevertheless, this type of participation bias does
not preclude us from investigating the relationship
between diet and well-being in this sample. Another
possible limitation is that the SDQ and the KINDL® were
designed for children from the age of 4 and 7 respect-
ively, which is slightly older than some of the youngest
children in our study. Further, parental reports of chil-
dren’s diet and well-being were used due to the young
age group; however, both the KINDL® and the SDQ have
shown good inter-rater correlations between children
and parent reports [23, 27]. Regarding the diet indices, it
should be noted that the HDAS was based on healthy
dietary guidelines common for the eight European coun-
tries included in the IDEFICS study, hence substantial
evidence of good health effects are underlying the foods
and beverages included. Additionally, the FFQ that is the
basis of the HDAS has been validated and found to be
reproducible [18, 19], although usual diet may still be
biased with respect to social desirability. Finally, weight
could act as both a confounder and mediator in the as-
sociation between diet and well-being; hence all analyses
were controlled for BMI, although there could still be
residual confounding from e.g. fat mass and fat distribu-
tion not captured by BMI. Moreover, no data was avail-
able
on
family
psychosocial
disadvantage
like
e.g.
parental well-being. Hence, there is still the possibility
that the observed associations could be explained by re-
sidual confounding by aspects of both diet and well-
being that our instruments were not able to capture. To
end with the authors acknowledge that the high preva-
lence of the outcome better self-esteem close to 50%
could lead to an overestimation of the odds ratios
reported. However, this applies to both diet and self-
esteem as outcome variable and should not affect the bi-
directional comparability. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis
using quartiles of adherence to the Healthy Dietary
Adherence score could confirm a monotonic trend in all
indicators of well-being with higher diet quality.
Conclusion
We have shown evidence of prospective associations be-
tween higher adherence to healthy dietary guidelines and
better well-being in a large European cohort study. In con-
trast to previous research we focused on a large number of
healthy components of the children’s diet hence not exclu-
sively unhealthy food consumption. Furthermore, a bidir-
ectional
association
was
identified
between
higher
adherence to the Healthy Diet Adherence score and better
self-esteem. These results are not limited to normal weight
or overweight children and suggest a particularly positive
role of a healthy diet on children’s well-being that should
be considered in future research on psychosocial well-
being in children.

Ethics approval and consent to participate
Institutional and governmental regulations concerning the ethical use of
human volunteers were followed during this research, and the IDEFICS study
passed the Ethics Review process of the Sixth Framework Programme (FP6)
of the European Commission. Ethical approval was obtained from the
relevant local or national ethics committees by each of the eight study
centers, namely from the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Ghent
(Belgium), the National Bioethics Committee of Cyprus (Cyprus), the Tallinn
Medical Research Ethics Committee of the National Institutes for Health
Development (Estonia), the Ethics Committee of the University Bremen
(Germany), the Scientific and Research Ethics Committee of the Medical
Research Council Budapest (Hungary), the Ethics Committee of the Health
Office Avellino (Italy), the Ethics Committee for Clinical Research of Aragon
(Spain), and the Regional Ethical Review Board of Gothenburg (Sweden). All
parents or legal guardians of the participating children gave written
informed consent to data collection, examinations, collection of samples,
subsequent analysis and storage of personal data and collected samples.
Additionally, each child gave oral consent after being orally informed about
the modules by a study nurse immediately before every examination using a
simplified text. This procedure was chosen due to the young age of the
children. The oral consenting process was not further documented, but it
was subject to central and local training and quality control procedures of
the study. Study participants and their parents/legal guardians could consent
to single components of the study while abstaining from others. All
procedures were approved by the above-mentioned ethics committees.
