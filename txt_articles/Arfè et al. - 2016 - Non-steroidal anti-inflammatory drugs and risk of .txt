ABSTRACT
ObjeCtives
To investigate the cardiovascular safety of non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and 
estimate the risk of hospital admission for heart failure 
with use of individual NSAIDs.
Design
Nested case-control study.
setting
Five population based healthcare databases from four 
European countries (the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, 
and the United Kingdom).
PartiCiPants
Adult individuals (age ≥18 years) who started NSAID 
treatment in 2000-10. Overall, 92 163 hospital 
admissions for heart failure were identified and 
matched with 8 246 403 controls (matched via risk set 
sampling according to age, sex, year of cohort entry).
Main OutCOMe Measure
Association between risk of hospital admission for 
heart failure and use of 27 individual NSAIDs, 
including 23 traditional NSAIDs and four selective COX 
2 inhibitors. Associations were assessed by 
multivariable conditional logistic regression models. 
The dose-response relation between NSAID use and 
heart failure risk was also assessed.
results
Current use of any NSAID (use in preceding 14 days) 
was found to be associated with a 19% increase of risk 
of hospital admission for heart failure (adjusted odds 
ratio 1.19; 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.22), 
compared with past use of any NSAIDs (use >183 days 
in the past). Risk of admission for heart failure 
increased for seven traditional NSAIDs (diclofenac, 
ibuprofen, indomethacin, ketorolac, naproxen, 
nimesulide, and piroxicam) and two COX 2 inhibitors 
(etoricoxib and rofecoxib). Odds ratios ranged from 
1.16 (95% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.27) for naproxen 
to 1.83 (1.66 to 2.02) for ketorolac. Risk of heart failure 
doubled for diclofenac, etoricoxib, indomethacin, 
piroxicam, and rofecoxib used at very high doses (≥2 
defined daily dose equivalents), although some 
confidence intervals were wide. Even medium doses 
(0.9-1.2 defined daily dose equivalents) of 
indomethacin and etoricoxib were associated with 
increased risk. There was no evidence that celecoxib 
increased the risk of admission for heart failure at 
commonly used doses.
COnClusiOns
The risk of hospital admission for heart failure 
associated with current use of NSAIDs appears to vary 
between individual NSAIDs, and this effect is dose 
dependent. This risk is associated with the use of a 
large number of individual NSAIDs reported by this 
study, which could help to inform both clinicians and 
health regulators.
Introduction
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a 
broad class of agents with analgesic and anti-inflam-
matory properties that inhibit the two recognised isoen-
zymes of prostaglandin G/H synthase (also known as 
cyclo-oxygenase (COX))—namely, COX 1 and COX 2.1 
 
Because the therapeutic action of these drugs is mostly 
mediated by inhibition of COX 2, while their gastroin-
testinal adverse reactions are largely due to COX 1 inhi-
bition, NSAIDs selectively inhibiting COX 2 were 
developed in the 1990s to reduce the risk of gastrointes-
tinal toxicity.2
Nevertheless, reports of cardiovascular adverse reac-
tions began to emerge in 2000-03,3 4  and subsequent 
placebo controlled trials showed that COX 2 inhibitors 
were associated with an increased risk of atherothrom-
botic vascular events.5 
6  However, meta-analyses of ran-
domised trials and observational studies have since 
shown that the higher cardiovascular risk is not 
restricted to COX 2 inhibitors, but also applies to some 
traditional NSAIDs.7-12
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Several randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an 
association between use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and 
increased risk of heart failure, but the risk and dose-response relation associated 
with individual NSAIDs is largely unknown
Heart failure was included as an outcome of interest in the Safety of Non-Steroidal 
Anti-Inflammatory Project, a multinational project funded by the European 
Commission under the seventh Framework Programme
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
Use of seven individual traditional NSAIDs (diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, 
ketorolac, naproxen, nimesulide, and piroxicam) and two individual COX 2 selective 
NSAIDs (etoricoxib and rofecoxib) is associated with and increased risk of hospital 
admission for heart failure
Risk of admission for heart failure is doubled for some NSAIDs used at very high doses
Estimates of the risk of heart failure associated with the use of many individual 
NSAIDs in this study could help to inform both clinicians and health regulators

In particular, NSAID use has been found to be associ-
ated with an increased risk of heart failure in several ran-
domised clinical trials11  and observational studies.13 
14 
 
A large meta-analysis of over 600 randomised trials 
showed that COX 2 inhibitors and high doses of tradi-
tional NSAIDs (that is, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and 
naproxen) increased the risk of hospital admission for 
heart failure from 1.9-fold to 2.5-fold compared with pla-
cebo.11  In the light of this evidence, current guidelines 
limit the use of NSAIDs in patients predisposed to heart 
failure, with a full contraindication for patients with 
diagnosed heart failure.15
Nevertheless, there is still limited information on the 
risk of heart failure associated with the use of individ-
ual NSAIDs (both COX 2 inhibitors and traditional 
NSAIDs) in clinical practice, and especially on their 
dose-response associations. Therefore, heart failure 
was included as an outcome of interest in the overall 
cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risk evaluation of 
individual NSAIDs within the Safety of Non-Steroidal 
Anti-Inflammatory (SOS) Project, a multinational proj-
ect funded by the European Commission under the sev-
enth Framework Programme. A large, common 
protocol, nested case-control study based on electronic 
healthcare databases from four European countries 
was carried out.
Methods
Data sources
This study was based on five electronic health data-
bases from four European countries: the Netherlands, 
Italy, Germany, and the UK. Overall, these databases 
covered over 37 million people with different time 
 
windows of data availability between 1999 and 2010; 
table 1 summarises their main characteristics.
Briefly, PHARMO is a population based, medical 
record linkage system covering more than two million 
inhabitants from the Netherlands. SISR is an electronic 
administrative healthcare database in Italy, covering 
the about 10 million residents in the Lombardy region, 
who all receive free healthcare assistance from the Ital-
ian national health service. OSSIFF is a healthcare data-
base covering about three million individuals who are 
beneficiaries of eight local health authorities in the 
Lombardy region. Because OSSIFF covers a subset of 
the population already covered by SISR, we included 
only the seven million beneficiaries of the Italian 
national health service not already included in OSSIFF 
in this study. GePaRD is a claims database in Germany 
covering about 14 million individuals enrolled in four 
German statutory health insurance providers. Lastly, 
THIN is a general practice database comprising primary 
care medical records from more than 10 million individ-
uals in the UK.
Each database longitudinally recorded data on each 
member of its target population, including demo-
graphic data, hospital discharge diagnoses, and outpa-
tient drug prescriptions. Data on outpatient diagnoses 
were also available from GePaRD. In two databases 
(PHARMO and THIN), the daily dose prescribed by phy-
sicians was recorded for each dispensed prescription. 
Further details are reported elsewhere.17
Harmonisation and data processing
Databases differed in several aspects, including type 
of collected information (that is, healthcare use, 
claims, and primary care data) and classification sys-
tems used for disease and medication coding (table 1 ). 
As a result, we performed data harmonisation accord-
ing to a procedure developed and assessed in the Euro-
pean Union (EU)-ADR (exploring and understanding 
adverse drug reactions by integrative mining of clini-
cal records and biomedical knowledge) Project18  and 
also implemented in other EU funded projects.19  Spe-
cifically, the Unified Medical Language system (for 
clinical diagnoses and conditions) and the Anatomic 
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system (for 
drug prescriptions) were mapped into the coding sys-
tems used by the individual databases. This mapping 
ensured that the data extraction processes targeted 
the same semantic concepts across all databases, thus 
allowing analyses to be performed under a common 
data model.19
Anonymised data were extracted locally and pro-
cessed with Jerboa software (developed by Erasmus 
MC), providing individual level datasets in a common 
data format. These datasets were securely transferred 
into the SOS data warehouse, hosted by the University 
of Milano-Bicocca, to be analysed centrally and 
securely.19

Cohort selection and follow-up
Following the new users paradigm,16 a cohort of individ-
uals starting NSAID treatment was selected from all data-
bases. In detail, adults (age ≥18 years) who received at 
least one NSAID prescription or dispensation (ATC code 
M01A; excluding topical NSAIDs) during 2000-10 were 
considered eligible to enter the cohort. The date of first 
recorded prescription or dispensation was defined as the 
date of cohort entry. We excluded participants if they: 
• Did not have at least one year of uninterrupted obser-
vation before the date of cohort entry, to ensure 
enough time of observation for assessing baseline 
covariates and applying the next exclusion criteria
• Received one or more NSAIDs within the year preced-
ing the date of cohort entry, to exclude prevalent 
NSAIDs users
• Received a diagnosis of malignant cancer, with the 
exception of non-melanoma skin cancers, to 
exclude patients who may have had particular con-
traindications 
• Were admitted to hospital with a primary diagnosis of 
heart failure in the year before the date of cohort 
entry, to avoid the inclusion of events occurring 
before the start of NSAIDs use (note that secondary 
hospital or outpatient heart failure diagnoses were 
not considered as exclusion criteria).
Each cohort member accumulated person years of 
follow-up, from the date of cohort entry to the earliest 
date of outcome onset (date of first hospital admission 
with a primary diagnosis of heart failure), censoring 
(end of registration in the database due to death or emi-
gration), diagnosis of malignancy (excluding non-mel-
anoma skin cancers), or end of database specific data 
availability.
Cases and controls
A case-control study was nested into the cohort of new 
users of NSAIDs. The endpoint of interest was the first 
hospital admission for heart failure (that is, with heart 
failure as the main cause or reason of hospital admis-
sion) identified during follow-up. Heart failure is a clin-
ical syndrome involving several pathophysiological 
mechanisms that, along with factors triggering circula-
tory decompensation, could produce heterogeneous 
clinical manifestations that often receive delayed diag-
nosis. Therefore, our endpoint definition did not 
include diagnostic codes for clinical heart failure in the 
outpatient setting and secondary hospital discharge 
codes for heart failure (which are likely to represent 
heart failure manifestations occurring during hospital 
admission for other causes).
Consequently, cases were all cohort members admit-
ted for heart failure during follow-up, identified either 
from primary hospital discharge diagnoses (PHARMO, 
SISR, OSSIFF, GePaRD) or codes registered by the gen-
eral practitioner (THIN). We defined the date of the first 
admission for heart failure identified during follow-up 
as the index date. Codes used to identify heart failure 
cases in each database are reported in the supplemen-
tary material (table S1).
We matched each case to up to 100 controls. Controls 
were randomly selected by risk set sampling from all 
cohort members whose follow-up did not end before the 
index date of the considered case (that is, among 
 
individuals still at risk of an admission for heart failure). 
Matching was performed within each database accord-
ing to sex, age at cohort entry (within 1 year’s difference), 
and date of cohort entry (within 28 days’ difference).
exposure to nsaiDs
All NSAIDs dispensations received by cohort members 
during follow-up were identified; this included 27 indi-
vidual NSAIDs (23 traditional NSAIDs and four selective 
COX 2 inhibitors). For each cohort member, we directly 
calculated the period covered by the availability of each 
individual NSAID by the prescribed daily dose, if avail-
able (that is, PHARMO and THIN databases), or by 
dividing the total amount of drug prescribed for the 
defined daily dose.
We classified cohort members into the following cat-
egories of NSAID use: current, recent, and past. Current 
users were patients with NSAID availability at the index 
date or the preceding 14 days. The remaining patients 
were defined recent users if they had NSAID availability 
during the time window of 15-183 days before the index 
date, or past users otherwise (reference).
Covariates
We assessed several covariates for each cohort member 
if available in the corresponding database, including:
• History of outpatient or secondary inpatient diagno-
ses of heart failure, comorbidities, and lifestyle fea-
tures or clinical characteristics, assessed in the 12 
months before cohort entry
• Concomitant use of specific drugs, assessed in the 90 
days before the index date. 
Comorbidities were assessed by hospital discharge 
diagnoses (PHARMO, GePaRD, SISR, OSSIFF), 
 
outpatient clinical diagnoses (GePaRD), clinical elec-
tronic general practice records (THIN), and use of spe-
cific drugs. Table 2 reports the full list of covariates.
statistical analysis
Individual level data from all databases were firstly 
gathered into a pooled dataset and analysed by means 
of a multivariable conditional logistic regression 
model.20  The obtained odds ratio, with 95% confidence 
intervals, estimated the risk of hospital admission for 
heart failure associated with current use of individual 
NSAIDs with respect to past use of any NSAID. We also 
estimated the odds ratio associated with recent use of 
any NSAID, compared with past use of any NSAID. 
Given the substantial number of associations assessed 
in this analysis, we used the Bonferroni-Holm proce-
dure21  to assess the impact of uncertainty due to multi-
ple comparisons on the results.22  Some evidence has 
supported the relative cardiovascular safety of cele-
coxib by comparison with other NSAIDs is available in 
the literature.14

between current use of individual NSAIDs and heart 
failure risk, using current use of celecoxib as reference. 
Among the covariates mentioned above, those available 
in all databases (including history of outpatient or sec-
ondary inpatient diagnoses of heart failure) entered the 
model. We did subgroups analyses after stratification 
for sex and history of heart failure diagnoses.
Because databases differed with respect to covered 
populations, as well as type and level of detail of avail-
able covariates, we evaluated the robustness of the 
pooled estimates using a meta-analytic approach by 
means of the following procedure. Firstly, we separately 
fitted a conditional logistic regression model to esti-
mate the effect of each individual NSAID within each 
database. To avoid computational issues (that is, model 
convergence failure due to sparse data), only individual 
NSAIDs with at least five exposed cases were considered 
in the model. The covariates available for all databases 
were always forced to enter the model, provided they 
reached at least 5% prevalence among controls. Other 
covariates were included, provided they were signifi-
cantly (P<0.05) associated with the outcome in a uni-
variate analysis, and selected from a backward 
procedure (P>0.10 for removal). Secondly, we used a 
random effects meta-analytic model29 30 to estimate a 
summary odds ratio (and 95% confidence interval) 
across databases for current use of each individual 
NSAID (provided that a point estimate was available 
from at least two databases), compared with past use of 
any NSAID. Heterogeneity between database specific 
odds ratios was assessed by Cochran’s Q and Higgins’ I2 
statistics.31

Dose-response analysis
We did a dose-response analysis to assess how the risk 
of hospital admission for heart failure associated with 
current use of individual NSAIDs varied along the con-
sidered categories of prescribed daily dose. Because 
Italian and German databases did not record data on 
prescribed daily doses, we pooled individual level data 
from the Netherlands (PHARMO) and the UK (THIN) 
databases. Patients for whom the information on the 
prescribed daily dose was not available were excluded.
The prescribed daily dose was expressed in defined 
daily dose equivalents (DDD) and categorised as low 
(≤0.8 DDD), medium (0.9-1.2 DDD), high (1.3-1.9), or very 
high dose (≥2 DDD) with respect to the corresponding 
defined daily dose. To avoid computational issues, we 
considered only NSAIDs for which all the considered 
categories included at least one heart failure case in the 
analysis. Tests for trends in odds ratios were performed. 
We did statistical analyses using SAS software (version 
9.3; SAS Institute). All tests were two sided and consid-
ered significant for P values less than 0.05.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research 
 
question or the outcome measures, nor were they 
involved in developing plans for design or 
 
implementation of the study. No patients were asked to 
advise on interpretation or writing up of results. There 
are no plans to  
disseminate the results of the research to 
study participants or the relevant patient community.
Results
study cohort
Supplementary figure S1 shows the flowchart describ-
ing the attrition of eligible NSAIDs users after exclusion 
criteria were applied. Among nearly 10 million new 
users of NSAIDs identified across all databases, 
7 680 181 met the inclusion criteria and constituted the 
study cohort. Cohort members accumulated 24 555 063 
person years of follow-up and generated 92 163 cases of 
heart failure admitted to hospital (incident rate, 37
.5 
heart failure events per 10 000 person years). Cases 
were matched to 8 246 403 controls.
Mean age was 77 (standard deviation 11) years and 
76 (10) years among cases and controls, respectively 
(table 2). About 45% of both cases and controls were 
men. Compared with controls, cases had more comor-
bidities (mainly cardiovascular disease, such as acute 
myocardial infarction, other ischaemic heart diseases, 
atrial fibrillation and flutter, and valvular disease and 
endocarditis) and received concomitant drug treat-
ments more often (eg, anticoagulants, cardiac

glycosides, nitrates, and cytochrome P450 2C9 inhibi-
tors). We found 9.1% of cases and 2.5% of controls with 
a history of heart failure diagnosis, recorded as either 
an outpatient diagnosis or a secondary hospital diag-
nosis in the year before start of NSAID treatment 
(cohort entry).
nsaiD use and heart failure risk
A total of 16 081 (17.4%) cases and 1 193 537 (14.4%) 
matched controls were current users of NSAIDs. Fig 1 
reports the distribution of current use of individual 
NSAIDs among all cases and controls. Among controls, 
the most frequently used traditional NSAIDs were 
diclofenac (2.9%), nimesulide (2.4%), and ibuprofen 
(1.7%), while the most frequently used COX 2 inhibitors 
were celecoxib (1.4%), rofecoxib (1.0%), and etoricoxib 
(0.6%).
According to the pooled analysis, current users of any 
NSAID had a 20% higher risk of heart failure than past 
users (odds ratio 1.19; 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 
1.22). Conversely, there was no evidence that recent use 
of any NSAID was associated with differences in heart 
failure risk with respect to past use (1.00; 0.99 to 1.02). 
We observed a statistically significantly higher risk of 
heart failure in association with current use of nine 
individual NSAIDs than with past use of any NSAIDs 
(fig 1). These NSAIDs were ketorolac, etoricoxib, indo-
methacin, rofecoxib, piroxicam, diclofenac, ibuprofen, 
nimesulide, and naproxen. Other less frequently used 
NSAIDs (eg, sulindac, acemethacin, and dexibuprofen) 
were also found to be associated with an increased risk 
of heart failure, although the 95% confidence intervals 
included the null value. All nine significant associa-
tions identified in this analysis were also identified as 
significant by the Bonferroni-Holm procedure (supple-
mentary table S2).
Compared with current use of celecoxib, current use 
of other individual NSAIDs was not associated with a 
significant decrease in heart failure risk. Odds ratios 
ranged from 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.57 to 1.20) 
for oxaprozin to 1.84 (1.67 to 2.04) for ketorolac (supple-
mentary table S3).
For the nine individual NSAIDs significantly associ-
ated with heart failure risk, their association was also 
confirmed regardless of whether there was recorded 
evidence of a prior heart failure diagnosis and regard-
less of sex (table 3). The estimated risk of heart failure 
associated with current use of NSAIDs of nimesulide, 
etoricoxib, and indomethacin among women was lower 
in magnitude than among men, compared with past use 
of any NSAIDs.
According to meta-analytic analysis, current users 
of any NSAID had a 24% higher risk of heart failure 
risk than past users (odds ratio 1.24; 95% confidence 
interval 1.12 to 1.36; fig 2 ). In addition to the nine indi-
vidual NSAIDs with significant associations with 
heart failure risk, we found current use of nabu-
metone was also associated with higher risk of heart

failure (fig 2). Although between database heteroge-
neity was relevant (I2>70%), meta-analytic estimates 
of odds ratios were generally consistent with corre-
sponding values obtained from the analysis of pooled 
individual level data.
Dose-response relation
Twenty (0.2%) cases and 855 (0.1%) controls from 
PHARMO and 753 (4.3%) cases and 61 777 (4.3%) con-
trols from THIN were excluded because prescribed daily 
dose data were not recorded. The remaining 25 179 cases 
and 2 083 706 controls gathered from PHARMO and 
THIN entered the dose-response analysis.
Current users of very high doses of diclofenac, 
etoricoxib, indomethacin, piroxicam, and rofecoxib 
had more than a twofold higher risk of heart failure 
than past users (fig 3). The odds ratio associated with 
current high dose use of ibuprofen was also compatible 
with an increased risk of heart failure, despite the wide 
confidence interval. Finally, there was no evidence that 
celecoxib increased the risk of hospital admission 
heart failure at commonly used doses compared with 
past use of any NSAIDs. However, we cannot exclude 
an increase in risk when celecoxib is used at very high 
doses, given the wide confidence intervals obtained for 
this dose class.
supplementary findings
Supplementary tables S4-S7 report the distribution of 
case and controls according to the considered covari-
ates, use of individual NSAIDs, and dose categories of 
current NSAIDs use (in DDD equivalents and corre-
sponding daily amount of active principle in mg), as 
well as the effects of individual NSAIDs on the heart 
failure risk.
discussion
Principal findings
Our study, based on real world data on almost 10 mil-
lion NSAIDs users from four European countries, pro-
vides evidence that current use of both COX 2 inhibitors 
and traditional individual NSAIDs are associated with 
increased risk of heart failure. Furthermore, the magni-
tude of the association varies between individual 
NSAIDs and according to the prescribed dose.
NSAIDs inhibit the isoenzymes of prostaglandin G/H 
synthase, COX 1 and COX 2.1  The overall effects of this 
inhibition of the prostaglandin synthesis are to increase 
peripheral systemic resistance and reduce renal perfu-
sion, glomerular filtration rate, and sodium excretion in 
susceptible individuals.32 33  Taken together, these 
mechanisms could trigger clinical manifestations of 
heart failure, especially in susceptible patients.23  Addi-
tionally, because the level of prostaglandin inhibition 
mediated by NSAIDs increases with dose,14 
34 the risk of 
clinical heart failure could be expected to increase 
along with the used NSAIDs dose.
Our study found an increased risk of hospital admis-
sion for heart failure in association with current use of 
several traditional NSAIDs (diclofenac, ibuprofen, 
indomethacin, ketorolac, naproxen, nimesulide, piroxi-
cam, and possibly nabumetone) and two COX 2 inhibi-
tors (etoricoxib and rofecoxib). We confirmed these 
findings after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Addi-
tionally, we found evidence that the increased risk of 
heart failure also affected patients without prior outpa-
tient diagnosis or secondary hospital diagnosis heart 
failure—that is, those ideally less susceptible to heart 
failure decompensations. We also observed an increas-
ing dose dependent risk of heart failure for most indi-
vidual NSAIDs. Finally, indomethacin and etoricoxib

seemed to increase the risk of hospital admission for 
heart failure even if used at medium doses.
No significant differences in the magnitude of the 
association between use of individual NSAIDs and 
heart failure risk were found between patients with or 
without prior heart failure (for all NSAIDs) and between 
the sexes (with a few exceptions of NSAIDs). However, 
power of our analysis could have been too low to detect 
significant differences between the considered sub-
groups.
Our study did not find that celecoxib, the most widely 
prescribed selective COX 2 inhibitor, increases the risk 
of hospital admission for heart failure. Lack of statisti-
cal power is unlikely explain such lack of evidence, 
because our main analysis had 80% power to detect 
significant odd ratios as low as 1.08 for the current use 
of celecoxib.35 Celecoxib also did not show an increased 
heart failure risk when used at the highest doses, 
although power of our analysis was low for this dose 
class (about 30% power to detect significant odds ratios 
of 2.00). Furthermore, our study found little evidence 
that celecoxib is associated with a greater risk of heart 
failure than any of the other 26 considered individual 
NSAIDs.
Comparison with other studies
Our findings extend those of the meta-analysis of ran-
domised trials,11  which showed that the risk of hospital 
admission for heart failure was roughly doubled by all 
studied NSAID regimens compared with placebo. 
 
Similarly, a meta-analysis of six trials did not show dif-
ferences in heart failure risk between traditional 
NSAIDs and COX 2 inhibitors.13  Estimates provided by 
the few published observational studies on the NSAID 
heart failure association are compatible with an 
increased risk of heart failure associated with naproxen, 
ibuprofen, ketoprofen, piroxicam, indomethacin, and 
rofecoxib, but not for celecoxib.14 23-27  Our results also 
accord with the body of evidence supporting the rela-
tive cardiovascular safety of low to medium doses of 
celecoxib for treatment of arthritis compared with all 
other COX 2 inhibitors.28
Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis 
that selective and non-selective COX 2 inhibitors 
increase the risk of heart failure, but that the magnitude 
of this effect varies between individual drugs and 
according to the dose used.32  The effect of individual 
NSAIDs could depend on a complex interaction of phar-
macological properties, including duration and extent 
of platelet inhibition, extent of blood pressure increase, 
and properties possibly unique to the molecule.28
strengths and limitations of study
Our findings, which focused only on prescription 
NSAIDs, might apply to NSAIDs obtained over the 
counter as well. Although over-the-counter NSAIDs are 
probably typically used at lower doses, by younger peo-
ple, and for shorter durations than prescribed NSAIDs,

Fig 3 | Dose-response relation between currently prescribed doses of specific nsaiDs and risk of heart failure, compared with past use of any nsaiD. 
Pooled data were obtained from the netherlands (PHarMO) and uK (tHin) databases for this analysis. Currently prescribed doses of each nsaiD 
categorised as low (0.8 defined daily dose equivalents), medium (0.9-1.2), high (1.3-1.9), and very high (≥2). Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals 
estimated by fitting a conditional logistic regression model after correcting for available covariates

they are sometimes available at the same doses than 
those prescribed36  and may be inappropriately over-
used.37 Therefore, our findings could have large scale 
consequences in public health and further research 
needs to assess the safety of over-the-counter NSAIDs 
under the conditions they are typically used.
The present study, conducted as part of the EU funded 
SOS Project, is based on data from large and unselected 
populations and obtained by combining different 
healthcare databases together. The same approach was 
considered in several other EU funded projects address-
ing various issues on drug safety, such as the arrhythmo-
genic risk of drugs (ARITMO project), safety of vaccines 
(VAESCO project), and detection of adverse drug reac-
tions (EU ADR project).18 
19 The use of five different data 
sources from the SOS Project should be considered a 
strength of this study because it allowed us to compare 
the risk of heart failure associated with many individual 
NSAIDs as used in different populations and healthcare 
systems from four EU countries.
Our study had some limitations. Firstly, our study 
might not have captured all NSAID exposure, because 
some of these drugs (eg, ibuprofen) are also available 
over the counter in all the four countries. Hence, 
patients classified as non-current users of NSAIDs in 
this study might actually have been current users of 
over the counter NSAIDs. Such misclassification would 
tend to, on average, bias estimates toward the null,38 
39 
with the implication that our findings might understate 
the actual association between use of individual 
NSAIDs and heart failure risk.
Secondly, validity of outcome ascertainment might 
be of concern because heart failure is often associated 
with other cardiovascular diseases (eg, myocardial 
infarction), which could affect how hospital discharge 
codes are recorded. Nevertheless, although privacy con-
cerns inhibited the validation of records in most partic-
ipating databases, the positive predictive value for 
heart failure hospital admissions included in the Italian 
OSSIFF database was found to be 80% (95% confidence 
interval 66% to 90%). Additionally, high positive pre-
dictive values have been reported by other investiga-
tions based on healthcare databases for heart failure 
diagnosis codes at hospital discharge considered in our 
study.40  In fact, the incidence of almost 37
.5 heart fail-
ure cases every 10 000 person years observed in our 
study does not substantially differ from rates reported 
by available population based studies.41  Still, even with 
some outcome misclassification,42  this is expected to be 
non-differential—that is, independent of current use of 
NSAIDs—leading to a bias moving estimated associa-
tions towards the null.43  However, non-differential mis-
classification (of outcome or exposure) might lead to 
inflated observed associations due to chance alone.44
Thirdly, our dose-response analysis could have been 
underpowered for some NSAID dose classes because 
only the PHARMO and THIN databases could be consid-
ered. Additionally, a portion of patients registered in 
these two databases had to be excluded from the 
dose-response analysis because they lacked the pre-
scribed daily dose information. Although this exclusion 
might have led to some bias,45 the number of excluded 
individuals was low and is unlikely to have had a signif-
icant effect on the results.
Fourthly, the effect of heterogeneous patient charac-
teristics at baseline must be considered in the interpre-
tation of our findings. Some individual NSAIDs more 
frequently used for different acute or chronic indica-
tions could have resulted in different patterns of use as 
well as in different types of populations of users.46 To 
address this possibility, we adjusted pooled estimates 
for several demographic, therapeutic, and clinical char-
acteristics (including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthri-
tis and inflammatory polyarthritis) at baseline, 
measured in all the included data sources. In addition, 
estimates did not substantially change in the random 
effects meta-analytic approach, where database spe-
cific estimates were adjusted for all baseline covariates 
available in the considered data source. Relative risk 
estimates for individual NSAIDs among patients with 
prior outpatient or secondary hospital diagnoses of 
heart failure (that is, those with a contraindication for 
NSAID use who also should be more susceptible for 
acute clinical manifestations of heart failure) did not 
seem to differ substantially from those obtained in the 
overall analysis. Taken together, these results provide 
some protection to our findings. Nevertheless, we can-
not exclude that residual differences in patient's base-
line characteristics could account for some of the 
observed variations in relative risk estimates associated 
with different individual NSAIDs.
Lastly, some diseases that modify both the risk of 
heart failure and probability of current NSAID use 
might not have been fully accounted for in this study. To 
protect against this possibility, we adjusted all our esti-
mates for concomitant (that is, in the current period) 
use of specific drugs (eg, nitrates, diuretics, or other 
drugs for cardiovascular diseases) as a proxy of 
patients’ current health status. Still, residual confound-
ing cannot be excluded. For example, gout is poten-
tially an uncontrolled confounder of the association 
between current use of NSAIDs and heart failure risk in 
this study. This is because gout is an independent risk 
factor for heart failure,47  and NSAIDs are the first phar-
macological choice for treating acute gout episodes.48 
 
However, the following considerations further 
strengthen our conclusions. We assumed that gout has 
a 1% prevalence in our source population and that it 
increases heart failure risk by 1.74-fold.47 
49  With these 
figures, we estimated50 that, to fully explain the 
observed association between naproxen and heart fail-
ure (naproxen being the NSAID with the weakest statis-
tically significant association with heart failure in this 
study), acute gout episodes should have increased the 
odds of being treated in the current period rather than 
the past period by 33-fold, an implausibly high amount.
Conclusions
Our study offers further evidence that the most fre-
quently used individual traditional NSAIDs and selec-
tive COX 2 inhibitors are associated with an increased 
risk of hospital admission for heart failure. Moreover,

the risk seems to vary between drugs and according to 
the dose. For the individual NSAIDs less frequently 
used, we were not able to exclude a risk of low to mod-
erate magnitude owing to the limited numbers of 
exposed cases identified in this study. Because any 
potential increased risk could have a considerable 
impact on public health, the risk effect estimates pro-
vided by this study may help inform both clinical prac-
tices and regulatory activities.
