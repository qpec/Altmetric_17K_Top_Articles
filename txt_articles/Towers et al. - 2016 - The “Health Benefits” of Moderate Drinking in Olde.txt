Abstract
Objectives: To assess whether a relationship between alcohol use and health exists for older adults before and after control-
ling for proxy and full indicators of socioeconomic status (SES).
Method: Secondary analysis of data from 2,908 participants in the New Zealand Longitudinal Study of Ageing (2012) 
completing measures of alcohol use, health, SES proxies (income, education) and SES. Sample mean age was 65, 52% were 
female, more than 80% were drinkers, and more than 75% had educational qualifications.
Results: Moderate drinkers had better health and SES than heavier or nondrinkers. The positive influence of moderate 
alcohol consumption on health was observed for men and women when controlling for SES proxies, but was substantially 
reduced in women and completely disappeared for men when controlling for full SES.
Discussion: SES plays a key role in presumed “heath benefits” of moderate alcohol consumption for older adults. It accounts 
for any alcohol–health relationship in a sample of men of whom 45% consume at least one drink daily, and substantially 
attenuates the association between alcohol and health in a sample of women who are not frequent drinkers. Prior research 
may have missed the influence of SES on this alcohol–health relationship due to the use of incomplete SES measures.
Keywords:  Alcohol—Moderate drinking—Socioeconomic status—Substance use
A growing catalogue of studies illustrate that any appar-
ent “health benefits” of moderate alcohol consumption 
are significantly attenuated or disappear completely after 
controlling for underlying differences between those who 
drink and those who don’t (e.g., Eigenbrodt et al., 2006; 
Fekjær, 2013; Fillmore, Kerr, Stockwell, Chikritzhs, & 
 
Bostrom, 2006; Mukamal, Ding, & Djoussé, 2006; 
Naimi et al., 2005; Naimi, Xuan, Brown, & Saitz, 2012). 
Despite these findings, Di Castelnuovo, Costanzo, Donati, 
Iacoviello, and de Gaetano (2010) conclude that a “health 
protective effect” of moderate alcohol consumption is now 
“widely accepted by the scientific community” (p. 291). 
Rubin (2014) even suggests that family physicians might 
consider alcohol as a preventive therapeutic intervention. 
Such pronouncements possibly explain why the majority 
of the general population believe that moderate drink-
ing is health protective (e.g., Ogborne & Smart, 2001). 
Clarifying the influence that alcohol might have on health 
is especially important for older adults. Age-related physio-
logical changes increase older adults sensitivity to alcohol 
(Davies & Bowen, 1999) and they are more likely than 
younger adults to have health conditions, multiple medi-
cations, and physical frailty which can negatively interact 
with alcohol (Bright, Fink, Beck, Gabriel, & Singh, 2015). 
Despite these age-related alcohol issues, many older adults 
actively self-medicate with alcohol based on the widespread 
assumption that it is beneficial (Aira, Hartikainen, & 
 
Sulkava, 2008).

 A true 
“health benefit” of moderate alcohol consumption 
for older adults should be evident when controlling for key 
contextual factors related to both health and alcohol use, 
such as one’s socioeconomic status (SES). SES is a key pre-
dictor of older adults health status (Demakakos, Nazroo, 
Breeze, & Marmot, 2008; Stephens, Alpass, & Towers, 
2010) and their alcohol consumption (e.g., Platt, Sloan, & 
 
Costanzo, 2010; Towers et al., 2011). The few studies 
focusing on the relationship between SES and the health 
of older drinkers (e.g., Balsa, Homer, Fleming, & French, 
2008; Holahan, Schutte, Brennan, Holahan, & Moos, 2010, 
2014) found that moderate drinking is positively related 
to health even while controlling for SES. However, these 
studies utilised proxy indicators of SES (e.g., income and 
education level) rather than measures that actually gauge 
the availability of capital to meet the individual’s lifestyle 
needs, which is a better indicator of SES than education or 
income (Grundy & Holt, 2001). Furthermore, SES is a bet-
ter predictor of older adults’ health and drinking level than 
education and income (Stephens, Alpass, Towers, Noone, & 
 
Stevenson, 2011; Towers et al., 2011).
Using indicators of average drinking frequency and 
quantity as commonly employed in alcohol use guidelines 
worldwide the current study aimed to explore whether 
perceived health is related to alcohol consumption in older 
adults and, if so, whether this relationship still exists when 
controlling for simple SES proxies as opposed to a com-
prehensive SES measure. Furthermore, acknowledging that 
any benefits of moderate alcohol consumption may differ 
by gender (cf. Balsa et al., 2008), we explored these rela-
tionships separately for older men and women. Based on 
previous findings we hypothesised that (a) moderate drink-
ing would be related to better health than heavy or no 
drinking, (b) that such relationships would remain when 
controlling for SES proxies, but (c) this relationship would 
either disappear or be significantly attenuated when con-
trolling for a comprehensive SES measure.
Methods
Study Population
This study represents a secondary analysis of existing 
cross-sectional data from the second wave (2012) of the 
New Zealand Longitudinal Study of Ageing (NZLSA) 
which included a representative sample of New Zealanders 
aged 52–86. NZLSA survey sampling and data collection 
methods have been described in depth elsewhere (Towers, 
Stevenson, Breheny, & Allen, 2016). A total of 2,976 were 
included in the NZLSA 2012 data collection wave. All 
participants had been randomly selected from the New 
Zealand electoral roll and had completed the first wave 
of postal survey data collection in 2010 prior to their par-
ticipation in the 2012 data collection wave. Participants 
completed a self-report postal questionnaire covering a 
broad range of measures including health, wealth, wellbe-
ing, and demographic characteristics. To reduce potential 
bias caused by the exclusion of persons with missing data, 
missing values were imputed using SPSS’s expectation-
maximization estimation procedure. Following the recom-
mendations of Graham (2009), all model and auxiliary 
variables which could inform the estimation of missing 
variables were included in this procedure. Participants 
who had less than 25% missing item data on model vari-
ables (n = 2,908, 97.7%) were included in the imputation 
procedure and analyses. Overall, 2.3% of item data were 
imputed. Results generated from the imputed dataset were 
compared with those generated using a list wise dele-
tion strategy with no statistically significant variations 
observed. A comprehensive population weight was applied 
to all analyses to control for any imbalance between in 
gender, age, and ethnicity between the NZLSA 2012 sam-
ple and the New Zealand older adult population in 2012. 
Table 1 provides the sample characteristics (population 
weighting applied).
Measures
Physical health
Physical health was measured using the SF-12v2 Physical 
Health Component Summary score (PCS; Ware, Kosinski, & 
Dewey, 2000) with scores standardized using PCS coeffi-
cients specific to New Zealand older adults.
Alcohol use
Participants completed the first two items of the AUDIT-C 
hazardous drinking screen (Bush et al., 1998) measuring 
average frequency and quantity of consumption. Quantity 
and frequency responses were multiplicatively combined 
to provide an average daily drinking amount. Participants 
scoring zero (never drink) completed a third item ask-
ing whether they had ever consumed alcohol in the past 
(responses: yes/no). This facilitated differentiation of “cur-
rent nondrinkers” from “lifetime abstainers.”
Socioeconomic status
As per previous research we utilized participant income 
alongside highest education level as SES proxies. Income 
was separated into distinct $10,000 bands up to a maximum 
of “$100,000 or more.”. Education consisted of four levels 
reflecting “no secondary,”, “secondary” (high school), “post-
secondary” (trade), and “tertiary” (university). We utilized 
the Economic Living Standard Index-Short Form (ELSI-SF; 
Jensen, Spittal, & Krishnan, 2005) as a direct measure of SES. 
The ELSI-SF is a 25-item self-report measure assessing levels 
of economic consumption capacity, economic-related social 
activity, material standard of living, and asset ownership.
Results
Table 1 illustrates characteristics of the sample and iden-
tifies that almost 45% of older men drank at least once 
daily as opposed to less than 25% of older women.

 Figures 1 and 2 present trends in physical health and SES 
for women and men across alcohol consumption groups 
based on a categorisation of the continuous “average daily 
drinking” measure and including both nondrinking groups. 
Both figures illustrate the traditional finding that moderate 
drinkers (i.e., 1–2 drinks daily) appear to have better health 
than either nondrinkers or heavy drinkers. However, they 
also show that SES levels closely model this same trend, 
suggesting that any relationship between alcohol use and 
levels of health is strongly linked to SES.
Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to 
determine if alcohol use is associated with physical health 
when controlling for both proxy and full SES indicators. For 
this analysis, the sample excluded those currently identified as 
“current nondrinkers” as this cohort is frequently identified 
in prior research as a confounder due to existing ill health 
(e.g., Naimi et al., 2005). Alcohol use was quantified using 
the continuous quantity–frequency measure and all lifetime 
abstainers given consumption levels equal to zero. The ini-
tial step of the model included age as a known covariate of 
consumption and health. Average alcohol use was entered in 
the second step of the regression model alongside a squared 
alcohol use variable accounting for the quadratic relationship 
with physical health observed in Figures 1 and 2. The two 
SES proxies income and education (three dummy-coded edu-
cation variables) were entered in the third step of the model, 
and SES entered last to assess its impact on the alcohol–
health relationship over and above any influence of income 
and education. Standardized betas were reported to facilitate 
direct comparison of the influence of each variable on health.
Table 2 presents the results of the regression analysis. 
For older men, the quadratic relationship between alco-
hol and health is evident when controlling for SES prox-
ies but disappears when SES is controlled for. For women, 
the direct linear relationship between alcohol and health 
exists after controlling for SES proxies and is substantially 
reduced—though still evident—when controlling for SES. 
This gender-specific finding is potentially underpinned by 
the higher numbers of men drinking more than one drink 
per day. The low number of women drinking at such levels 
makes it difficult to clarify whether this is indeed an accu-
rate reflection of the influence of moderate alcohol use on 
health for older women.

 Discussion
Consistent with prior studies, we found that older men 
drink more than older women and those who drink mod-
erately appear to be in better health than non- or heavy 
drinkers. However, this study illustrates that relationships 
between drinking and health and drinking and SES are 
strikingly similar, a finding which calls into question the 
assumptions that alcohol is simply beneficial for health. 
Furthermore, when SES was controlled for in our analyses, 
the salubrious effect of moderate alcohol consumption dis-
appeared entirely for men and was substantially attenuated 
for women. These findings are novel in that they identify a 
clear gender effect of SES, but the results for men in par-
ticular are consistent with other, similarly focused studies, 
indicating that the perceived “health benefits” of moderate 
alcohol consumption are largely due to existing differences 
between drinking groups (e.g., Eigenbrodt et al., 2006; 
Fekjær, 2013; Naimi et al., 2005, 2012). Our results also 
potentially explain those by Balsa and colleagues (2008) 
and Holahan and colleagues (2010) whose SES proxies 
moderated, but did not explain entirely, the relationship 
between alcohol and health in older adults. A comprehen-
sive SES indicator clearly accounts for considerably more 
variance in men and women’s health than either education 
or income, and explains the alcohol–heath relationship 
entirely for older men. These findings illustrate that SES 
proxies such as income level and education are not ade-
quate indicators of SES in older adults (Grundy & Holt, 
2001) and are, therefore, unlikely to adequately control for 
one’s ability to afford both regular alcohol and capacity for 
better health.
This study utilized a cross-sectional methodology, 
which limits our understanding of causative relationships 
between alcohol consumption, SES, and health. Future 
studies with longitudinal methods and hierarchical mod-
elling techniques are warranted. This study also utilized 
a sample of older New Zealander drinkers who have 
been shown to drink at relatively high levels (Stevenson 
et al., 2015). The generalizability of these findings to 
other nationalities is thus limited. However, while our 
study does not provide evidence for causal relationships 
among the variables it is logical to suggest that, rather 
than alcohol having a beneficial influence on the health 
of older adults, higher SES levels may simply facilitate 
lifestyles that enable both regular moderate drinking 
and the capacity for better health. To assess the gener-
alizability of these findings to wider health variables we 
re-estimated the regression models for men and women 
using total number of experienced health conditions 
 
(14 conditions including high blood pressure, diabetes, and 
cancer), a measure moderately correlated with the physi-
cal health variable used in the original model (r = −.50). 
The results paralleled those for the initial models, with the 
addition of SES in the final step of the model eliminat-
ing any initial relationship between alcohol variables and 
total number of health conditions for men and attenuating 
(but not eliminating) this relationship for women. This is 
further evidence that regardless of whether the key health 
indicator is self-reported health status or indicated health 
conditions the influence of SES on the assumed relation-
ship between alcohol and health are almost identical.
