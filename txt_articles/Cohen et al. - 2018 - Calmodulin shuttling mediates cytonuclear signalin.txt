Learning and memory depend on neuronal plasticity originating at the synapse and requiring
nuclear gene expression to persist. However, how synapse-to-nucleus communication sup-
ports long-term plasticity and behavior has remained elusive. Among cytonuclear signaling
proteins, γCaMKII stands out in its ability to rapidly shuttle Ca2+/CaM to the nucleus and
thus activate CREB-dependent transcription. Here we show that elimination of γCaMKII
prevents activity-dependent expression of key genes (BDNF, c-Fos, Arc), inhibits persistent
synaptic strengthening, and impairs spatial memory in vivo. Deletion of γCaMKII in adult
excitatory neurons exerts similar effects. A point mutation in γCaMKII, previously uncovered
in a case of intellectual disability, selectively disrupts CaM sequestration and CaM shuttling.
Remarkably, this mutation is sufficient to disrupt gene expression and spatial learning in vivo.
Thus, this specific form of cytonuclear signaling plays a key role in learning and memory
and contributes to neuropsychiatric disease.

ong-term plasticity and learning requires activity-dependent
nuclear transcription1,2, a form of regulated gene expression
that contributes to a critical dialog between synapse and
nucleus3–5. Excitation-induced recruitment of nuclear transcrip-
tion factors is exemplified by the phosphorylation of calcium- and
cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), a transcription
factor particularly important for learning and memory6,7. Genetic
manipulation of nuclear CREB by mutation of Ser133 to phos-
phomimetic or non-phosphorylatable forms dramatically alters
synaptic plasticity and spatial memory8. This focuses attention on
the line of communication initiated by the opening of post-
synaptic ligand- and voltage-gated channels7 and culminates in
the phosphorylation and resulting activation of CREB8,9 and
subsequent expression of plasticity-related genes10. Multiple
hypotheses concerning the molecular basis of this communication
have been advanced11–14, some invoking nucleus-directed trans-
location of signaling molecules like NFκB, Rsk2, Jacob, and
CRTC114–19. However, manipulation of these molecules produces
confounding changes in brain development and anatomy20–23,
basal
synaptic
properties21,
or
excitability17.
Thus,
clear
mechanistic links between neuronal activity, nuclear CREB
phosphorylation, and memory consolidation have not been
established, leading to consideration of the idea that no translo-
cating protein is required at all11–14.
To address questions surrounding the relevance of nuclear
signaling for synaptic plasticity, gene expression and behavior,
while avoiding ambiguous effects from the elimination or
sequestration of multifunctional signaling molecules, we sought
to manipulate the transport of the signaling protein while sparing
the protein itself. We applied this strategy to the nuclear trans-
location of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)18,19,24, which can switch on a
nuclear-resident CaM kinase cascade, thus activating both CREB
and CREB binding protein (CBP). Synaptic plasticity and spatial
memory are both drastically affected by sequestration of nuclear
Ca2+/CaM24 or by inhibition of CaMKIV25,26, the CREB kinase
activated by Ca2+/CaM. To interfere with the Ca2+/CaM-
dependent path of communication between synapse and nucleus
in vivo, we manipulated CaMKII gamma (γCaMKII), the
Ca2+/CaM shuttle protein in excitatory neurons19,27.
We show that genetic deletion of γCaMKII severely impairs
activity-dependent expression of key plasticity genes (BDNF,
c-Fos, Arc), persistent synaptic strengthening (late LTP or L-LTP),
and memory, without detectable changes in anatomy. The
necessity of Ca2+/CaM translocation per se was further estab-
lished by introducing a γCaMKII point mutation discovered in
an intellectually disabled boy28. The mutant γCaMKII (R292P)
trapped Ca2+/CaM for only seconds rather than minutes, reached
the nucleus without its Ca2+/CaM cargo, and failed to support
gene expression, L-LTP or long-term memory. Thus, signaling
to the nucleus by Ca2+/CaM translocation supports learning and
memory and shows vulnerability in neuropsychiatric disease.
Results
γCaMKII is critical for gene expression and L-LTP and
learning. γCaMKII knockout (KO) mice were fully viable29 and
displayed no detectable developmental, morphological or histo-
logical brain abnormalities (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b; see also
Supplementary Fig. 3, below), minimizing concern about con-
founding effects on brain development. A custom antibody raised
against γCaMKII confirmed the absence of γCaMKII in the
γCaMKII KO brain (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Levels of α−, β−,
and δCaMKII, as well as other critical neuronal activity-related
proteins, were no different than in wild-type (WT) littermates
(Supplementary Fig. 1d, e). Neuronal morphology, assessed by
Golgi staining of pyramidal neuron dendrites, was not detectably
altered (Supplementary Fig. 1f). To assess the role of γCaMKII in
the brain, we subjected γCaMKII KO mice to an extensive battery
of behavioral tests (Supplementary Fig. 2). γCaMKII KO mice
displayed pronounced impairments in multiple spatial learning
tasks designed to assess long-term memory, including the Morris
Water Maze (MWM)3,8,24,30,31, the radial arm maze (RAM), and
the inhibitory avoidance task, each of which invoke different
motivations and motor systems. In MWM testing, γCaMKII KO
mice were deficient in the learning of platform location compared
to WT littermates; latency to escape improved more slowly in KO
animals and remained longer than WT even after 3–4 days of
training (Fig. 1a). In a probe trial (hidden platform removed) on
day 5, γCaMKII KO mice took ~5-fold longer to reach the former
platform zone and entered that zone half as often (Fig. 1a),
suggesting shortcomings in prior memorization.
To look for biochemical underpinnings of the deficits in
learning and memory3,9,32,33, we monitored the experience-
driven expression of three major CREB-dependent target genes,
BDNF, c-Fos, and Arc (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1g). Before
training, their expressed protein levels in vivo were similar in WT
and γCaMKII KO hippocampus. One hour after MWM training,
WT mice displayed a significant increase in hippocampal
expression of these genes as compared to naïve animals, assessed
by immunoblot (Fig. 1b, black bars), consistent with previous
reports10. In contrast, deletion of γCaMKII prevented the
training-induced elevation of expression of all three genes
(p > 0.4, Fig. 1b, rightmost red bars). Thus, γCaMKII is critical
for experience-dependent expression of CREB target genes over
the course of spatial learning in vivo.
A similar comparison was made between behavior and gene
expression for an inhibitory avoidance (IA) task, in which
animals were mildly shocked following entry into the dark
compartment of a 2-compartment chamber. WT and γCaMKII
KO mice were indistinguishable in the latency to explore the dark
compartment during trials prior to administration of a mild
shock (dashed lines, Fig. 1c), and in test sessions if no shock was
given in the training sessions (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Upon
further testing 24 h later, WT animals reliably avoided the
conditioned context whereas γCaMKII KO mice were deficient in
this avoidance behavior (Fig. 1c, p < 0.05, Kolmogorov–Smirnov
test).
Correspondingly,
the
proportion
of
c-Fos-positive
pyramidal neurons was elevated in the WT controls but not in
the γCaMKII KO group. Thus, the inhibitory avoidance task
provided another example of faulty learning associated with
a lack of enduring gene expression. In both hippocampal-
dependent tasks (MWM and IA), the absence of γCaMKII
engendered clear deficiencies in behavioral performance, compar-
able to deficits produced by lesions to hippocampal area CA134.
To clarify the mechanism underlying the deficit in learning, we
next asked whether disruption of γCaMKII signaling affects
hippocampal late-LTP (L-LTP). This enduring form of synaptic
plasticity depends on transcription and translation and supports
spatial memory formation5,6,24,35,36. We induced L-LTP at
Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses with a standard protocol, three
trains
of
tetanic
stimulation
(100 Hz,
1 s)
spaced
by
5 min3,24,31,37, in hippocampal slices derived from WT and
γCaMKII KO mice. While no deficit was observed in early LTP
(E-LTP) between genotypes, L-LTP was strongly affected (Fig. 1d):
the initial potentiation in γCaMKII KO slices decayed much
faster than that in WT, with a clear difference emerging at 2 h
post tetanization (Fig. 1d) (WT: 140.7 ± 5.5%, KO: 121.5 ± 3.9%,
n = 6 mice, p = 0.02), and growing up to the end of recording
(WT: 134.9 ± 5.9%, KO: 105.9 ± 8.4%, n = 6 mice, p = 0.02). In
contrast, no differences were found in basal properties of WT and
γCaMKII KO slices (Fig. 1d): synaptic input–output relationship
(ratios of fEPSP slope to fiber volley of 4.61 ± 0.81 for WT vs.

somatic Ca2+ influx in response to 100 Hz stimulation38.
Our finding of reduced L-LTP with intact E-LTP suggested that
γCaMKII KO mice might display deficits in long-term (reference)
memory but not short-term (working) memory. In the radial arm
maze, γCaMKII KO mice were no different than WT animals
upon first presentation of arm locations (reference “errors”,
day 1), but failed to show memory savings 24 h later (Fig. 1e).
In contrast, KO and WT mice committed similar numbers of
short-term (working memory) errors. Likewise, further tests in
the MWM indicated that deficiency in γCaMKII KO performance
specifically reflected a spatial learning deficit; our behavioral
results could not be otherwise explained by reluctance to
swim, swimming speed, wall-hugging behavior, muscle function

 (forelimb-hanging test), locomotor activity (open field test), or
anxiety (tendency to thigmotaxis, open field test and elevated zero
maze) (Supplementary Fig. 2). Taken together, these results
suggest that γCaMKII plays a critical role in a series of events
encompassing experience-dependent gene expression, L-LTP and
long-term memory in multiple settings.
γCaMKII downstream of CaV1/NMDARs regulates spatial
learning. To narrow down the requirements for γCaMKII sig-
naling, we selectively deleted γCaMKII in excitatory neurons
late in development, using offspring of γCaMKIILoxP/LoxP mice
crossed with αCaMKII-CRE mice (exc-KO, Fig. 2a). Hippo-
campal CA1 pyramidal neurons so deprived of γCaMKII were
no different than WT with regard to passive membrane proper-
ties, excitability, dendritic branching (Supplementary Fig. 3c)
or cellnumber (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Nonetheless, selective
elimination of γCaMKII in excitatory neurons impaired spatial
learning (Fig. 2a), recapitulating the deficiency in MWM per-
formance observed with global γCaMKII deletion (p = 0.5,
Fig. 1a). Befitting the role of γCaMKII as a surface-to-nucleus
shuttle for Ca2+/CaM19, training-induced CaM translocation,
seen as increased nuclear CaM immunostaining in WT mice, was
eliminated in γCaMKII exc-KO animals (Fig. 2b, c). Likewise,
elevation of nuclear c-Fos, reflective of training-induced gene
expression in vivo10, was similarly inhibited (Fig. 2b, c). In con-
trast, basal levels of expression of c-Fos, Arc, BDNF, or nuclear
CaM were no different in γCaMKII exc-KO mice and WT lit-
termates (Supplementary Fig. 4), indicating that γCaMKII acted
mainly under conditions of training.
These results raised questions about signaling by NMDA
receptors, whose importance for induction of L-LTP and learning
is well known31,32 but whose linkage to nuclear shuttling of
Ca2+/CaM by γCaMKII remains mysterious. To address this,

 we exposed cultured hippocampal or cortical neurons to 25 μM
NMDA and 5 μM glycine to activate NMDARs, as confirmed
with NMDAR-selective blocker APV (Fig. 2d–k and Supplemen-
tary Fig. 5a, b). NMDA stimulation elevated nuclear CaM
(reflected by the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio, nuc/cyt) and increased
pCaMKIV. Involvement of γCaMKII in NMDA-dependent
cytonuclear signaling was tested by infecting neurons with

pCREB, and c-Fos evoked by NMDA stimulation were prevented
or largely reduced by the γCaMKII shRNA (Fig. 2d–g). Thus, the
γCaMKII pathway supported NMDA receptors in signaling to the
nucleus (Fig. 2l).
Further experiments clarified how signaling by γCaMKII
relates to the classical MAP kinase pathway. NMDA-driven

 ERK) (Fig. 2h, i). NMDA stimulation also triggered an increase in
pCREB that was prevented by nimodipine or KN93 (Fig. 2j), and
also reduced by PD98059, consistent with involvement of both
CaMK and MAPK pathways39 (see ref. 39 for earlier references).
NMDA-driven
elevation
of
c-Fos
protein,
assayed
40 min
following stimulation to allow time for transcription and
translation, was prevented by nimodipine, KN93, or PD98059
(Fig. 2k).
These results indicate that NMDAR activation drives divergent
γCaMKII- and MAPK-mediated pathways that reconverge to
control gene expression. We verified that deletion of γCaMKII
spared critical markers of the MAPK signaling branch (elevation
of nuclear levels of pMAPK, Rsk2, CRTC1; Supplementary Fig. 5).
Thus, the dramatic behavioral consequences of γCaMKII KO
(Figs. 1a, c, e and 2a) are specifically indicative of the role of
γCaMKII-mediated branch of the signaling to the nucleus.
ID-associated γCaMKII R292P mutation impairs CaM shut-
tling. To gain further insight into the functional significance of
cytonuclear communication by protein translocation, we focused
on genetic variation in γCaMKII that alters human intellectual
performance28. Extending an early study of heritability of intel-
lectual disability (ID) that implicated γCaMKII40, de Ligt et al.28
performed exome sequencing of a boy with severe ID and his
unaffected parents and discovered a de novo coding mutation in
γCaMKII (R292P, Fig. 3a). The positively charged residue at
position 292 is highly conserved across CaMKII isoforms (Sup-
plementary Fig. 6a) and neighbors a largely α-helical region
required for CaM binding41 (Fig. 3a); mutation to proline could
disrupt that region and its function. Accordingly, we reasoned
that this ID-linked mutation might illuminate the mechanism by
which γCaMKII supports learning and memory.
Lentiviral expression of human γCaMKII R292P in hippo-
campal slices from KO mice failed to rescue L-LTP (red trace,
Fig. 3b); early potentiation and late-phase decay were indis-
tinguishable from KO slices (black). In contrast, slices expressing
human WT γCaMKII (blue) showed strong early potentiation
that
was
maintained
throughout
the
recording,
and
was
significantly greater than that with γCaMKII R292P. The
disabling effect of the R292P mutation on synaptic plasticity
prompted us to analyze its impact on biochemical signaling
in vitro (Fig. 3c–f) and in neurons (Fig. 3g–j). Both purified WT
and R292P γCaMKII readily bound CaM as seen with CaM
overlays (Fig. 3c), underwent phosphorylation at T287 as detected
by pCaMKII-specific immunoblotting (Fig. 3d), and displayed
catalytic activity as a protein kinase (Fig. 3e). Beyond these
similarities between WT and mutant molecules, we noted a
potentially critical contribution of γCaMKII in which its kinase
activity is dispensable but its ability to trap and translocate CaM
to the nucleus is crucial19. Knowing that phosphorylation of
αCaMKII at T286 increased its affinity for Ca2+/CaM >1000-fold,
largely because of slowed CaM dissociation42,43, we characterized
such “CaM trapping” by WT and R292P mutant forms of
γCaMKII. The dissociation of fluorescently labeled CaM (CaM
(C75)IAE) from T287-phosphorylated γCaMKII was monitored
as a decrease in fluorescence upon sudden addition of non-
fluorescent CaM41. Strikingly, dissociation from the R292P
mutant was ~1500-fold faster than from WT γCaMKII, occurring
within seconds rather than minutes, even in the presence of
Ca2+ (Fig. 3f). Thus, by the time the mutant γCaMKII began to
accumulate in the nucleus (>30 s)19, CaM would no longer be
bound and would therefore not translocate effectively.
To test this prediction, we introduced WT or R292P forms of
γCaMKII into cultured hippocampal and cortical neurons from
γCaMKII KO mice. Neurons were depolarized with 40 mM
K+
and
protein
levels
in
isolated
nuclei
were
analyzed.
Stimulation-induced increases in c-Fos, nuclear CaM and nuclear
γCaMKII were absent in neurons from γCaMKII KO mice
(Fig. 3g–j and Supplementary Fig. 6b), as previously found in
cultured rat cortical neurons19. Each of these events was rescued
by re-introduction of WT human γCaMKII. In contrast,
γCaMKII R292P was able to translocate to the nucleus, but
unable to support nuclear CaM translocation or c-Fos expression
(Fig. 3g–j).
Having demonstrated the necessity of intact γCaMKII and
CaM shuttling for gene expression, we proceeded to test for
sufficiency of nuclear CaM delivery by directly uncaging CaM
in the nucleus. The vehicle was neurogranin, an endogenous
buffer
for
apoCaM
that
releases
CaM
once
it
becomes
Ca2+ bound, that we HA-tagged and targeted to the nucleus
(NLS-Nrgn)19. Immunocytochemistry verified that introduction
of γCaMKII R292P in cultured γCaMKII KO neurons failed to
rescue c-Fos expression, consistent with results from isolated

translocated to the nucleus (g, h); however, only re-introduction of transgenic γCaMKII (WT), not γCaMKII R292P, into γCaMKII KO neurons rescued
CaM translocation (g, i) and c-Fos expression (g, j). k c-Fos response in cultured hippocampal and cortical neurons from γCaMKII KO mice stimulated with

but not NLS-Nrgn S36D was able to restore the c-Fos response, consistent respectively with an ability or inability to harbor CaM for release upon nuclear
Ca2+ elevation19. Scale bar, 10 μm. Statistical analysis performed with one-way ANOVA followed by Holm–Sidak post hoc test unless otherwise noted.

 nuclei. In contrast, introduction of NLS-Nrgn along with
γCaMKII
R292P
fully
restored
stimulation-induced
c-Fos
expression (Fig. 3k and Supplementary Fig. 6c, d). The rescue
of c-Fos expression failed when the NLS-Nrgn was modified
(S36D) to render it incompetent to bind apoCaM and thus
release CaM upon Ca2+ influx (Fig. 3k and Supplementary
Fig. 6c, d). Thus, the failure of γCaMKII R292P could be
bypassed by exogenous replacement of nuclear Ca2+/CaM
elevation to circumvent the defective shuttle. Given that kinase
activity of γCaMKII is dispensable for signaling to the nucleus19,
the critical events for gene expression, operative in WT but lost in
the ID-linked mutant, are CaM trapping and nuclear CaM
delivery.
R292P mutation impairs gene expression and learning in vivo.
Returning full circle to spatial learning, we tested whether the
behavioral deficit in excitatory neuron-specific γCaMKII KO
mice could be repaired by acute expression of γCaMKII in the
mature hippocampus (Fig. 4a). Hippocampi of adult WT or
γCaMKII exc-KO mice were targeted with bilateral injections of
saline or lentiviruses containing WT or mutant human γCaMKII,
resulting in levels of expression of γCaMKII three-fold greater
than endogenous (Supplementary Fig. 6e). Strikingly, the deficit
in MWM spatial learning seen in γCaMKII exc-KO mice was
fully rescued by introduction of γCaMKII. To verify that the
behavioral repair was associated with rescue of nuclear signaling,
we stained CA1 pyramidal cells31 for CaM and c-Fos 1 h after

 MWM training. Both CaM translocation and c-Fos expression
were fully rescued by the re-introduction of γCaMKII (Fig. 4b, c).
Hence, behavioral performance depends critically on the avail-
ability of γCaMKII during the task, not its presence during brain
development.
Unlike WT γCaMKII, γCaMKII R292P failed to rescue the
spatial
learning
deficit
when
introduced
into
the
mature
hippocampus.
Mice
expressing
the
mutant
performed
no
differently than exc-KO animals (Fig. 4a). Likewise, they
displayed levels of nuclear c-Fos and CaM in CA1 that were no
higher than in γCaMKII exc-KO (Fig. 4c; p > 0.8) when examined
after MWM training. The strong correlation between post-
training nuclear CaM and c-Fos in WT mice (Fig. 4d) was
rescued in exc-KO mice by expression of human WT γCaMKII
(Fig. 4e); likewise, nuclear c-Fos was correlated with γCaMKII
(Fig. 4f). In contrast, following introduction of γCaMKII R292P,
nuclear c-Fos was not correlated with nuclear CaM (Fig. 4e), nor
with nuclear γCaMKII (Fig. 4f), even though basal levels of
expressed γCaMKII R292P were not different than expressed
γCaMKII (Supplementary Fig. 6e, f). These in vivo results reflect
inefficient CaM shuttling by the mutant protein. In all respects,
our observations with mutant γCaMKII R292P sharply con-
trasted with those obtained with γCaMKII.
γCaMKII R292P demonstrates dominant negative effect. We
next tested for a dominant-negative effect of the R292P mutant,
of possible relevance to the pathogenesis of ID in a human het-
erozygote. Interestingly, overexpressed γCaMKII R292P in cul-
tured
WT
hippocampal
neurons
prevented
nuclear
CaM
translocation, suggesting a strong dominant negative effect of
γCaMKII R292P in regulating nuclear CaM signaling (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6g). Moreover, following expression of γCaMKII
R292P in the hippocampus, escape latencies in the MWM were
no faster in WT than in exc-KO animals (Fig. 4g). Experience-
dependent c-Fos expression was compared in WT and exc-KO
hippocampus following behavioral testing. Unlike the striking
difference in experience-dependent c-Fos staining between WT
and exc-KO (Fig. 2b), in γCaMKII R292P-infected pyramidal
neurons, distinguished by their HA-tag (Fig. 4h), such post-
training differences were no longer observable (Fig. 4h, i). Evi-
dently, exogenous expression of mutant γCaMKII can nullify the
impact of normal protein with regard to gene expression as well
as behavior, consistent with some kind of dominant negative
effect.
Discussion
Here we show the importance of Ca2+/CaM translocation to the
nucleus for learning and memory, and how this translocation is
disrupted by a human mutation linked to intellectual disability.
Mediated by γCaMKII in excitatory neurons, the Ca2+/CaM
shuttle links activation of NMDARs44 and CaV1 channels19 to
nuclear transcription, thus supporting L-LTP and long-term
memory. Our in vivo experiments indicate that this mechanism is
necessary for classic hippocampal CA1-based learning in adult
animals. Independence from any possible effects of γCaMKII on
early brain development was demonstrated by late deletion of
γCaMKII (Fig. 2) and adult rescue by γCaMKII delivery in a
knockout background (Fig. 4).
As a mechanism for synaptic activity-dependent, cytonuclear
communication based on protein translocation45–48, Ca2+/CaM
shuttling can be compared with leading examples of synapto-
nuclear signaling (NFκB, RSK2, Jacob, CRTC1)11–13. It will be
interesting to see if these signaling pathways, well described in
neuronal cultures, are also critical for the establishment of
memory in vivo, separable from other important but confounding
functions distinct from memory storage17,20–23. The significance
of the γCaMKII/Ca2+/CaM shuttle could be cleanly defined via a
specific manipulation of shuttle function (Figs. 3 and 4) and
extensive control experiments to rule out morphological, bio-
chemical and behavioral side effects (Supplementary Figs. 1–6).
This addresses a long-standing challenge to studies of LTP:
finding key molecular underpinnings, as functionally critical to
neuroplasticity as a door hinge is to an opening door49, and
linking these processes to behavior.
The strong dominant negative effect of γCaMKII R292P
(Fig. 4g, h; Supplementary Fig. 6g) is intriguing as it helps to
establish a logical connection between our data and the (hetero-
zygous) human patient. A dominant negative effect could result
from competition between wild-type and mutant γCaMKII at
various critical steps along the shuttling pathway19: competition
for cross-phosphorylation of γCaMKII by α/βCaMKII, for
dephosphorylation by CaN to enable the NLS, or for binding to
protein components supporting transport to the nucleus. The
dominant negative effect of γCaMKII R292P cannot easily be
attributed to loss of catalytic activity because a charge-altering
mutation in the homologous position of αCaMKII (K291E)
enhances affinity for Ca2+/CaM 5-fold, via destabilization of
the basal CaM-free state50; further, we confirmed that γCaMKII
R292P
retained
kinase
activity.
Because
even
kinase-dead
γCaMKII is able to support nuclear Ca2+/CaM delivery19, a

 mutation-based deficiency in kinase activity of γCaMKII is
unlikely to explain how the R292P mutant interferes with E–T
coupling to affect long-term memory.
The functional relevance of the γCaMKII/Ca2+/CaM shuttle
mechanism is highlighted by human genetics. Each of the mole-
cules along the signaling pathway is encoded by a gene implicated
in multiple brain diseases, among them schizophrenia, major
depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum dis-
order. In particular, CAMK2G, the gene encoding γCaMKII,
contributes to a genetic cluster that influences memory perfor-
mance and imaged hippocampal activity in humans40, and has
cropped up in genetic studies of ASD51,52. In rodents, γCaMKII
has been implicated in depression-like behavior53 and as a reg-
ulatory target of the NMDA receptor-dependent microRNA miR-
21954. While the ID-linked R292P mutation28 causes the most
functionally precise lesion so far, it will likely be joined by other
genetic modifications that illuminate neuropsychiatric disorders
along with fundamental aspects of memory and cognition.
Methods
Data acquisition. All analyses were performed with the experimenter blinded to
the genotype of mice, cultured neurons and acute slices.
Animals. γCaMKII-KO and γCaMKII-exc-KO mice were kindly provided by Dr.
Eric N. Olson (UT Southwestern Medical Center) with help of Dr. Johannes Backs
and his staff (University of Heidelberg). αCaMKII-Cre mice (Stock No. 005359)
were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and maintained on a C57BL/6J
background. The mice (10–14 weeks of age, both genders) were used for behavioral
tests. Subject mice were kept in a 20 °C room on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights off
at 6:00 AM) with food and water available ad libitum. Mice were singly housed for
at least 7 d before experiments. All experiments were performed during the dark
cycle, after acclimatization to the experimental room for at least 3 d. All
experimental procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the New York University Langone Medical
Center and the Animal Advisory Committee at Zhejiang University.
Behavioral assays. All behavioral testing occurred between 0800 and 1800 h.
Spatial reference memory was tested using the MWM. A circular tank
(diameter: 183 cm) was filled with water at 20 °C and surrounded by uniform
blinds and quadrant-specific visual cues55. The water was made opaque by adding a
sufficient amount of Tempera paint. Animal movement was tracked using a ceiling
camera and Ethovision tracking software. Mice were introduced into the pool at
pseudo-randomized drop locations outside of the target quadrant. During the
“hidden platform learning task,” a circular escape platform (15 cm diameter) was
placed in the middle of a designated target quadrant 1 cm below the water surface.
Mice were trained to find the platform by four 90 s trials per day, performed on a
duty cycle of 14 min, for 4 consecutive days. During each block of trials, the mice
were released from four pseudo-randomly assigned start locations (NW, SW, NE,
and SW). A trial ended either when a subject rested on the hidden platform for 5 s
or the end of the trial was reached. Mice that failed to find the platform by the end
of the 90 s trial were manually guided to rest on the platform for 15 s. On day 5, a
90 s “probe trial” was conducted with the escape platform removed.
A modified radial arm maze was used to test working and reference memory
at the same time55. The floor of the maze was made of white plastic, and the walls
(13 cm high) consisted of transparent plexiglass. Each arm (13 × 40 cm) radiated
from an octagonal central starting platform (diameter 23 cm) like the spokes of a
wheel. The maze was elevated 75 cm above the floor and only four maze arms were
baited. Each mouse was weighed daily throughout training and tested to monitor
health and degree of food deprivation. Mice were deprived of food until their body
weight was reduced to 85–90% of the initial level. Mice were acclimated to the food
rewards (sweetened breakfast cereal) and food rewards were spread around the
entire maze to encourage exploration (3 d). On subsequent days, food was placed
only on the arms, then only at the ends of the arms before the test (2 d). After
training, the food reward was placed at the end of only four arms of the radial arm
maze before each test session. All doors were raised to allow the mouse to explore
the maze completely and retrieve all food rewards (or until 10 min trial time was
reached). The same four maze arms were baited each day and, across sessions, the
mice generally learned to ignore the remaining four arms, which never contained a
reward. Within a training session, re-entry into one of the four baited arms was
considered a working memory error, while entry into a never-baited arm was
considered a reference memory error.
For inhibitory avoidance training, a chamber was created consisting of a
rectangular-shaped Perspex box divided into a safe compartment (white and
illuminated) and a shock compartment (black and dark)56,57. Foot shocks were
delivered to the grid floor of this chamber via a constant current scrambler circuit.
The two compartments were separated by an automatically operated sliding door.
During training sessions, each mouse was placed in the safe compartment with its
head facing away from the door. After 10 s, the door was automatically opened,
allowing the mouse access to the shock compartment. The door closed after the
mouse entered the shock compartment, and a brief foot shock (0.5 mA for 2 s with
a 5 s delay) was administered to the mouse. Twenty-four hours after the training,
the mouse was placed back in the safe compartment and its latency to enter the
shock compartment was measured. The test was terminated at 300 s. 1 h after the
test, the animal was heart-perfused and the brain was rapidly dissected for
immunohistochemistry. Mice exposed to the inhibitory avoidance apparatus for
the same duration as the trained animals without receiving a foot shock were used
as the control group.
To assess locomotor activity, open field tests were performed in a novel
environment under low-light conditions55. The open field chamber consisted of a
square arena (40 × 40 cm) with opaque white walls. The test was initiated by
placing mice in the middle of the open field and allowing them to move freely for
10 min while being tracked by the Ethovision automated tracking system. The
chamber was cleaned with 70% alcohol between animals. Distance moved, velocity,
and time spent in each predefined zone were analyzed.
To test for anxiety traits, we conducted an elevated zero maze test55. The zero
maze consisted of an annular platform (diameter 40 cm, lane width 5 cm), elevated
40 cm from the floor, and was divided into four equal quadrants. Two opposite
quadrants were enclosed by gray plastic walls (height 15 cm). In the test, mice were
put on an open quadrant facing a closed quadrant and tracked for 8 min. Tests
were videotaped and subsequently analyzed.
To assess muscle strength using all four limbs, the four limb-hanging test was
performed in which a wire grid was used to measure the ability of mice to exhibit
sustained limb tension to oppose their weight. The hang time is measured from the
time the grid is inverted to the time that the mouse falls off the wire grid
(determined visually and measured using a stopwatch) and the Holding impulse is
the hang time multiplied by the body weight.
Primary cultures of cortical and hippocampal neurons. Hippocampal and
cortical neurons were cultured from postnatal day 0 to 1 Sprague-Dawley rat pups
or C57BL/6J mice. The hippocampus or frontal cortex were isolated and washed
twice in ice-cold modified HBSS (4.2 mM NaHCO3 and 1 mM HEPES, pH 7.35,
300 mOsm) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, UT) then
three times with ice-cold HBSS only. Tissues were digested for 30 min in a papain
solution (Worthington, NJ; 2.5 ml HBSS + 145 U papain + 40 μl DNase) at 37 °C
with gentle shaking every 10 min. Digestion was stopped by adding 5 ml of
modified HBSS containing 20% FBS. After additional washing, the tissue was
dissociated using Pasteur pipettes of decreasing diameter. The cell suspension was
pelleted twice and filtered with a 70 μm nylon strainer, and plated on 12 mm
diameter coverslips coated with poly-D-lysine. The cultures were maintained in
NbActiv4 (BrainBits, Springfield, IL). A 30% medium change was performed at
7 days, and once per week thereafter. Neurons were used 12–26 days after plating.
Drug treatments and stimulation. To induce CREB phosphorylation, Ca2+/CaM/
γCaMKII translocation, and other comparable or related events, we stimulated
hippocampal and cortical neurons with the indicated high [K+] solution or
NMDA-containing solution at 37 °C for 60–600 s, and fixed the cells immediately
after the stimulation (in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS with 20 mM EGTA and 4%
(w/v) sucrose). To induce c-Fos expression, we stimulated cells for 300 s, and then
moved the coverslip back to the basal media for 40 min, at which point cells were
fixed. 5 mM K Tyrode’s consisted of (in mM): 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2,
10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH 7.4. When stimulating with elevated [K+], Na+ was
adjusted to maintain osmolarity. All NMDA stimulation conditions were in 5 mM
K Tyrode’s containing 25 μM NMDA and 5 μM glycine. All K+-rich and NMDA-
containing stimulation solutions contained 0.5 μM TTX (Tocris) to block action
potentials, unless otherwise indicated. Where indicated, drugs were added 30 min
before and included throughout the stimulation: 10 μM NBQX (Tocris) to block
AMPA receptors, 50 μM D-AP5 (Ascent Scientific) to block NMDA receptors,
10 μM Nimodipine (Abcam) to block CaV1 channels, 4 μM KN93 (Tocris) to block
CaM Kinases, 50 μM PD98059 (Tocris) to block MEK1.
Lentiviral transduction of cultured neurons. To produce lentivirus, the
pLVTHM shRNA or pCDH-EF1- γCaMKII constructs were transfected into
293FT cells along with the packaging plasmid psPAX2 and the envelope plasmid
pMD2.g, kindly provided by Dr. D. Trono. After 16 h, the medium was changed.
The supernatant was collected 24 h later and cleared of cell debris by filtering
through a 0.45 mm filter. The viral particles were concentrated by centrifuging the
filtrate at 70,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C using a Beckman SW28 rotor. The viral pellet
was then resuspended in sterile PBS, aliquoted, and stored at 80 °C. Lentivirus
particles (0.5–1 ml of viral stock diluted in 20 ml of PBS per coverslip) were added
to cultured neurons containing 500 μl of medium the day after plating. Twenty-
four hours later, the cultures were fed with 1 ml of medium and used 4–5 days later,
at which point infection efficiency was nearly 100%.

 Slice preparation. Mice (postnatal 80–90 days) were anesthetized with isoflurane
and the brain was quickly dissected out after decapitation. Transverse acute slices
(350 μm thick) were sectioned on a vibratome in 95% O2/5% CO2 aerated ice-cold
sucrose cutting solution (in mM: 206 Sucrose, 26 NaHCO3, 11 Glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1
NaH2PO4, 20 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2). Then hippocampal slices were incubated in 95%
O2/5% CO2 aerated ACSF (in mM: 122 NaCl, 3 KCl, 10 Glucose, 1.25 NaH2PO4,
1.3 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 26 NaHCO3) at 32 °C to recover for 1 h, and then left at room
temperature for 1 h for further recovery for use up to 5 h later.
Electrophysiology. Field excitatory post-synaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings
were performed in area CA1 from 350 μm transverse acute slices. Recording was in
an interface chamber at 32 °C, perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF).
Slices were allowed 20–30 min to equilibrate in ACSF before recording. Recordings
were made with glass pipettes (3–5 MΩ) filled with ACSF and placed in the stratum
radiatum of CA1. A concentric bipolar tungsten stimulating electrode was placed
between area CA3 and CA1 for stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals. The intensity
of the stimulating pulse was adjusted to produce responses 30–50% of the max-
imum and 30 min of baseline recording was performed to ensure the stability of
responses. Late long-term potentiation (L-LTP) was induced by three 1 s trains of
100 Hz stimulation at 5 min intervals5,24,32. Stimulus intensity was equivalent in
test and induction responses.
CA1 pyramidal cell membrane properties were determined with whole-cell
current clamp recordings, performed with an intracellular solution containing (in
mM): 130 K-Gluconate, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.3 EGTA, 10 Tris-Phosphocreatine,
4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP and 0.1% biocytin. After maintenance of whole-cell
recording for 15–20 min, slices were transferred to a 4% paraformaldehyde fixative
solution overnight, then washed and stained with Alexa Fluor 488 streptavidin
(1:700, Molecular Probes). Cells were imaged with a Zeiss confocal microscope and
analyzed for dendritic morphology.
Field stimulation and calcium imaging. Following the cutting and recovery of
hippocampal slices, they were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by 15 min at
RT, in a 1:1 dilution of Fluo-4 (Life Technologies) in ACSF to load slices with the
Ca2+ indicator. Following loading, slices were placed on a stage, submerged in
fresh oxygenated ACSF. Two platinum electrodes were positioned with a distance
of ~10 mm on either side of the slices. The acute slices were field stimulated at 100
Hz for 5 s with square wave pulses (1 ms per pulse) at 15 V. Cells were imaged with
a Zeiss LSM 510 meta Imager.M1 confocal microscope at 1.25 Hz. ΔF/F Ca2+
responses were analyzed using Icy software.
Perfusion and fixation of tissue. Animals were anesthetized with a lethal dose of
pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) and underwent intracardiac perfusion with 50 ml of ice-
cold PBS. The brain was removed from the skull, the right side was immersed or
perfused with ice-cold solution made up of 4% PFA in PBS, pH 7.4 and the left side
was dissected into hippocampus and cortex that were snap-frozen and stored
at −80 °C until they were used for biochemical analyses. Twenty-four hours
PFA-fixed hemispheres were transferred to 30% sucrose until tissue sank, then
OCT-embedded and stored at −80 °C until performance of further tissue
sectioning and immunohistological analyses.
Morphology analysis. Six male mice (littermates aged P60-65, 3 mice per geno-
type) were used for morphological analysis. FD Rapid Golgi Stain Kit (FD Neu-
roTechnologies, MD, USA) was used for the staining procedure, following all
guidelines according to the manual. In brief, whole brains were dissected from each
animal, rinsed in Milli-Q water, and immersed fully in prepared impregnation
solution (solution A + B). The brains were stored at room temperature in the dark
for 2 weeks before being transferred into solution C. Sections of 150 μm were cut
on a vibratome, and mounted onto gelatin subbed slides (Southern Biotech, AL,
USA). After the sections had dried (2–3 days, left at room temperature), the
staining procedure described in the manual was followed. Hippocampal sections
were imaged on a Zeiss AxioObserver Inverted light microscope with a ×60 lens.
Between three and five neurons from hippocampal area CA1 were imaged from
each animal, and fully traced utilizing Neurolucida software (Microbrightfield
bioscience, VT, USA). The full extents of the apical and basal dendrites were traced
and analysis for branch length and number and Sholl analysis were carried out with
Neurolucida Explorer. Data was pooled for all neurons traced within individual
genotypes, resulting in ten neurons being analyzed for each group.
Viral injection surgery. Mice were anesthetized with Isoflurane (0.5% oxygen/3%
Isoflurane for induction and 0.5% oxygen/1.5% isoflurane for maintenance) during
viral injections. After induction, mice were tested for deep anesthesia levels, defined
as being unresponsive to noxious stimuli (i.e., ear twitch responses, pedal reflexes).
A subcutaneous dose of buprenorphine (0.05–0.1 mg/kg) was injected and
dextrose-lactated Ringer’s solution (1.2 ml s.c.) was administered before the
incision. After attainment of the appropriate level of anesthesia, the animal was
secured using ear bars and ophthalmic ointment was applied. The scalp fur was
shaved with a razor, the skin cleaned with betadine, and then a midline 1.5 mm
incision was made with a sterile scalpel. The subcutaneous tissue was reflected away
from the bone. The bone was dried with a cotton swab, and the stereotaxic
apparatus was used to mark the surface location of the coordinates for burr holes.
0.5-mm burr holes were drilled with a 23G1 needle over the parietal bone at the
following locations bilaterally where later the injections were performed at four
different points per hemisphere: 2.0–2.5 mm caudal and 1.4–1.7 mm lateral from
the bregma. A glass pipette containing virus was attached to a Nanoject II system
(Drummond Scientific company) and 100 nl of either lentivirus or saline was
injected in each of the 4 holes per hemisphere. The injection microelectrode was
slowly withdrawn 5 min after the virus infusion. Behavior experiments were per-
formed at least 14 days after surgery. The effectiveness of virus infections was
confirmed by staining with antibody against HA (Supplementary Fig. 6f).
After the virus injections, the incision was closed with silk sutures and topical
antibiotic was applied to the top of the suture to prevent infection. During
anesthesia recovery, mice were observed every 10–60 min and body temperature
was maintained at 37 °C using a heated pad until they were placed in their home
cage. All mice were maintained under a 12:12 h light:dark cycle after that and food
and water were provided ad libitum. Mice thrived and had normal activity within
12 h after the injections. Post-surgical anesthesia: a subcutaneous injection of
buprenorphine (0.05–0.1 mg/kg) at 24 h post-surgery was administered as well as a
dose of Dextrose-lactated Ringer’s solution (1.2 ml s.c.). Animals were monitored
twice daily for 3 more days for signs of pain or distress. No signs of infection and
no mortality were present for any of the animals in the study.
Protein expression and purification. The wild-type and mutant γCaMKII and
CaM were expressed in HEK 293 Cells and E. coli, respectively (CaM and CaM
(C75) were kind gifts from Dr. Neal Waxham). The CaMKII proteins were purified
using CaM-Sepharose affinity beads (Calmodulin Sepharose 4B, GE Healthcare)
and CHT ceramic hydroxyapatite (Bio-rad, #1588000) with gravity flow. For CaM
and its mutated counterpart CaM(C75), the proteins were purified with UNO-
sphere Q anion exchange resin (Bio-rad, #1560101) and CHT ceramic hydro-
xyapatite (Bio-rad, #1588000) with gravity flow. All proteins were purified
following the standard protocol from the manufacturer and eluted with a step
gradient of increasing concentrations of potassium phosphate buffer, as confirmed
with gel electrophoresis before the appropriate fractions were pooled.
Measurement of CaM dissociation rate from CaMKII. CaM(C75) was labeled
with IAEDANS (Thermofisher) as previously described with small modifications58.
Briefly, 50 nM CaM(C75) was incubated with 0.5 mM IAEDANS (urea not
present) overnight followed by dialysis using PD MiniTrapTM G-25 against 50 mM
MOPS, pH 7.0, 150 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM CaCl2 and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. 1
mM MgATP was added into the reaction solution containing 0.5 mM Ca2+, CaM
(C75)IAE and γCaMKII or γCaMKII R292P to enable phosphorylation at Thr 287.
After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, a 75-fold excess of unlabeled CaM
was added to exchange with labeled CaM(C75)IAE. For fluorescence measurements,
excitation was at 345 nm and emission at 465 nm was monitored at 3 Hz using a
Flex station. The experimental data was fitted with a two phase decay function
(Y = A1*exp(−t/τ1) + A2*exp(−t/τ2) + Y0).
CaMKII activity assay. The kinase activity of γCaMKII was measured using the
CycLex Calmodulin kinase II Assay Kit (Cat # CY-E1173, CycLex). Briefly, purified
γCaMKII or γCaMKII R292P (equal amounts) was added to the kinase reaction
buffer provided with the kit and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 96-well plates.
Wells were washed for five times with wash buffer and 100 μl of the horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated detection antibody MS-6E6 was added. After 60 min
incubation at room temperature, samples were washed five times, and the substrate
reagent (100 μl) was added. After 15 min incubation at room temperature, the
reaction was stopped by the addition of a stop solution and the absorbance read at
450 nm with a microplate reader.
Immunocytochemistry. Cultured cells were fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) in PBS supplemented with 20 mM EGTA and 4% (w/v) sucrose. Fixed cells
were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with 6% (cells) or 10%
(10 μm hippocampal slices) normal donkey serum, and incubated overnight (cells)
or two overnights (10 μm hippocampal slices) at 4 °C in primary antibodies: rabbit
anti-pCaMKIV (1:500, sc-28443-R, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse anti-CaM
(1:500, 05-173, Millipore); rabbit anti-pCREB (1:333, 9198, Cell Signaling
Technology); rabbit anti-c-Fos (1:500, 2250, Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit

H9658, Sigma-Aldrich); goat anti-Rsk2 (1:100, sc-1430, Santa Cruz); rabbit anti-
CRTC1 (1:100, A300-769A, Bethyl), mouse anti-αCaMKII (1:2000, 13-7300,
ThermoFisher). The next day, cells were washed with PBS, incubated at room
temperature for 45 min (for cells) or 2 h (hippocampal slices) with Alexa-tagged
secondary antibodies (1:1000 for cells, 1:500 for hippocampal slices, Molecular
Probes), washed with PBS and mounted using ProLong Gold (Invitrogen). The
cells or slices were imaged with a ×40 or ×60 (1.3 NA) oil objective on a confocal
microscope LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) or an Axioplan epifluorescent microscope
equipped with an AxioCam digital camera using AxioVision.

 Western blot. SDS-PAGE loading buffer and β-mercaptoethanol were added to
the lysate (25 and 10% of the total lysate volume, respectively), and the mixture was
heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Cellular protein was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel
and transferred to Immobilon transfer membrane (Millipore). The membrane was
then blocked at room temperature for 1 h in Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-Cor
Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). The membrane was incubated overnight with antibodies
as the γCaMKII antibody (rabbit, 1:1000) was raised against γCaMKII (amino
acids 441–460) and its specificity was tested in γCaMKII-/- mice; rabbit anti-Lamin
B (1:1000, 12586, Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:1000, 5174,
Cell Signaling Technology); mouse anti-HA (1:1000, H9658, Sigma); mouse anti-
CaM (1:500, 05-173, Millipore); rabbit anti-c-Fos (1:500, 2250, Cell Signaling

(1:1000, 13-7300, abcam); rabbit anti-pPKA (1:500, sc-377575, Santa Cruz, to track
PKA activation); rabbit anti-p44/42 MAPK (1:1000, 4370, Cell Signaling Tech-
nology); rabbit anti-p38 MAPK (1:1000, 9211, Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit
anti-NKCC1 (1:200, AB3560P, Chemicon International); rabbit anti-KCC2 (1:200,
07-432, Chemicon International); rabbit anti-GABAAR (1:200, Chemicon
International); rabbit anti-GluR (1:500, Millipore; Rabbit). The specificity of BDNF
antibody for WB or ICC was tested previously59–61 and the band (~16 kDa) was
examined for WB. The following day, the membrane was washed with 0.1% Tween
20 in PBS and incubated with an IRDye-labeled secondary antibody (Li-Cor) for 1
h. After incubation, the membrane was washed with PBS and imaged with Li-Cor
Odyssey imaging system. All the bands were analyzed with Image Studio. For
nuclear extraction, the nuclear proteins of cortical neurons (DIV13-15) were iso-
lated with NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent Kit (Thermo
Scientific) before the gel electrophoresis19. For CaM overlay, CaM (Enzo Life
Sciences) was added at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml in the 5 mM K+ Tyrode’s
and incubated with membrane for 1 h before addition of the primary antibody for
CaM62. Images in the main text have been cropped for presentation. Full size
images are presented in Supplementary Figs. 7–9.
Image analysis. For cultured neurons, images for protein quantification were
analyzed using a custom-written macro in ImageJ (NIH). The nuclear marker
DAPI and an antibody against the neuron-specific protein MAP2 were used to
delineate the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively. A region of interest adjacent to
each neuron analyzed was used as an ‘off-cell’ background. In cortical cultures,
αCaMKII was used as a marker to restrict analysis to excitatory neurons. The
protein level in each neuron was calculated by subtracting the average intensity in
the ‘off-cell’ background region of interest from the average intensity in the
appropriate region of interest for each neuron. The nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio was
calculated by comparing nuclear immunoreactivity with apical dendrite immu-
noreactivity (immunoreactivity of the membrane profile was not included).
For hippocampal slices, two images were taken in the CA1 from every slice (two
slices per animal). Using ImageJ, ROIs were chosen at each DAPI + nucleus in a
given section. The average pixel intensity of staining for the signal-of-interest was
obtained within the boundary of each nuclear ROI. From this value, a background
value (taken in the stratum radiatum) was subtracted. For c-Fos staining, an
arbitrary threshold of 50 intensity units was set and applied to all slices, and the
percentage of cells with c-Fos staining >50 was calculated for each image.
DNA constructs. The point mutation was produced using QuikChange
Lightning Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent) with pCDH-EF1a-HA-
γCaMKII19 as template and the following primer and its reverse-complement
(mutated bases in lower case bold):
γCaMKII R292P: G AAG TCG GAT GGC GGT GTC AAG AAA AGG AAG
gaG AGT TCC AGC GTG CAC CTA ATG GAG CC
All γCaMKII constructs in this study utilized the human γA’CaMKII isoform of
γCaMKII.
