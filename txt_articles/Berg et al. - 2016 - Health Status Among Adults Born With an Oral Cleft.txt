IMPORTANCE Parents regularly express concern about long-term health outcomes for
children who are born with an oral cleft.
OBJECTIVE To assess whether oral clefts affect the health and ability to work of young adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A population-based cohort study was conducted on all
individuals born in Norway between calendar years 1967 and 1992 (n = 1 490 401). All
patients treated for clefts in Norway during the study period were invited to participate
(n = 2860). This study used population-based, long-term follow-up data from national
registries to focus on the future health outcomes of individuals with cleft and no additional
chronic medical conditions or congenital anomalies. A total of 523 individuals were excluded
from the study cohort because they declined participation, could not be reached by mail, or
had birth defects other than clefts. The final cohort, consisting of 2337 cases with isolated
clefts and 1 413 819 unaffected individuals, was followed up until December 31, 2010, using
compulsory national registries and clinical data. Data analysis was conducted from February
13, 2014, to April 18, 2016.
EXPOSURES Oral clefts.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Death, intellectual disability, schizophrenia, mood affective
disorders, anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity
disorder, severe learning disability, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, muscle or skeletal disorders,
trauma, and episodes of reduced health.
RESULTS Of 2860 individuals born with an oral cleft, 2337 were included in the analysis; of
these, 1401 were male (59.9%). Mean (SD) age in 2010 was 30.6 (7.7) years. Compared with
unaffected individuals, no increased risks were found regarding morbidity or mortality among
persons with isolated cleft lip only. Among individuals with isolated cleft lip and cleft palate,
increased risks of intellectual disability (relative risk [RR], 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.1) and cerebral
palsy (RR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1-6.2) were found. Individuals with isolated cleft palate (ie, without
cleft lip) had increased mortality (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 2.1-5.7) in addition to an increased
risk of intellectual disability (RR, 11.5; 95% CI, 8.5-15.6), anxiety disorders (RR, 2.9; 95% CI,
1.3-6.5), autism spectrum disorders (RR, 6.6; 95% CI, 2.8-15.7), severe learning disabilities
(RR, 10.6; 95% CI, 5.5-20.2), cerebral palsy (RR, 4.8; 95% CI, 2.3-10.0), epilepsy (RR, 4.9; 95%
CI, 2.2-10.8), and muscle or skeletal disorders (RR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4-5.4).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Young adults who were born with isolated cleft lip only did
not differ significantly from unaffected individuals in their risk of health problems. However,
individuals with isolated cleft palate had increased health risks and mortality. This information
should be provided to genetic counselors, parents of children with clefts, and health care
workers involved in the treatment or follow-up of these children.

O
ral clefts are a relatively common category of birth de-
fects, with a prevalence of about 2.1 per 1000 live
birthsinNorway.1Oralcleftsmaybedividedinto3ma-
jor subgroups: cleft lip only (CLO), cleft lip and cleft palate
(CLP), and cleft palate only (CPO).
As do most other parents, parents of children with oral
clefts have a well of feelings at the time of birth of their child,
including a mixture of expectations, worries, and wishes for
their newborn.2 Even though surgery and accompanying treat-
ment may correct the appearance and restore crucial func-
tions, parents may feel anxious about their child’
s future.2-4
Such concerns have some support in the scientific literature.5-7
However, most research to date has focused on children and
adolescents, and our knowledge of long-term health status is
more limited.8 An additional, widely acknowledged, meth-
odologic challenge in cleft research is recruitment of large and
representative samples from which reliable and valid conclu-
sions can be drawn. Population-based studies comparing long-
term health status among unaffected individuals and those
born with a cleft may address some of these issues.
Some children with clefts have other underlying medical
conditions, including genetic syndromes,9,10 that may ex-
plain future health-related problems. Such underlying condi-
tions may be hard to detect both early in life and later. Risks
related to underlying conditions may be difficult to separate
from risks directly related to the oral cleft itself. As an at-
tempt to address this challenge, it is common to focus on a
group of individuals with isolated oral cleft (ie, no other con-
genital anomalies). Still, evaluation of the prospects of a child
with no congenital anomalies other than an oral cleft is
complicated.11,12 With these considerations in mind, it is none-
theless valuable for parents as well as clinicians to be in-
formed about future health risks for a child born with an iso-
lated oral cleft.
We had access to detailed information about health out-
comes and background characteristics for a cohort of approxi-
mately 1.5 million individuals born in Norway between 1967
and 1992. This cohort included a group of 2860 individuals
born with an oral cleft, who were followed up until 2010, when
all participants were between age 18 and 43 years. A total of
2337 persons in the cleft group had no other registered con-
genital anomaly. The aim of the present study was to com-
pare children who were born with an isolated oral cleft with
unaffected children regarding long-term health status and sur-
vival patterns.
Methods
Study Design
The 3 cleft subgroups (CLO, CLP, and CPO) were studied sepa-
rately because the etiology of the cleft differs between the
groups and the consequences regarding treatment and health
outcomes are likely to be affected by cleft type. The total co-
hortconsistedofall1 490 401live-bornindividualsborninNor-
way from calendar year 1967 to 1992. Follow-up was per-
formed until December 31, 2010, when all participants had
reached the age of majority (18 years), and the oldest partici-
pants were 43 years. All patients in the source population were
invited to participate in the study, although some could not
be contacted (n = 166). Information obtained from local pa-
tient registries, the Medical Birth Registry, the Education Data
Base, the National Insurance Scheme, the Cause of Death Reg-
istry, and the National Registry formed the basis of our analy-
ses.AllNorwegianshaveauniquepersonalidentificationnum-
ber, which facilitates the merging of the registries. Individuals
who were not present in all the registries or had unknown sur-
vival status (usually emigrated) were excluded from the study.
This exclusion also applied to individuals with any congeni-
tal malformation other than cleft, hydrocele, and hip dyspla-
sia. Chromosomal anomalies and genetic syndromes were
counted among the congenital anomalies if diagnosed within
the first days of life. After exclusions, the cohort consisted of
1 416 156 individuals, of whom 2337 had isolated oral clefts; the
remaining 1 413 819 individuals were in the reference group.
The exclusion procedure is outlined in Figure 1.
The study was approved by the Regional Committee for
Medical Research Ethics of Western Norway and required pa-
tients referred for cleft treatment (or, when too young, their
parents or guardians) to provide written informed consent to
participate in the study. There was no financial compensa-
tion; data were deidentified.
Data from local patient registries were available for all pa-
tients referred to cleft treatment in the study period. In Nor-
way,treatmentiscoordinatedby2centers(OsloUniversityHos-
pital and Haukeland University Hospital, Helse-Bergen,
Bergen). These 2 facilities have documented medical infor-
mation about all patients with oral cleft since the early 1960s.
Detailed information about the cleft diagnoses was obtained
from these data.
All health registries used in this study classify diagnoses
according to the International Classification of Diseases.13 Since
1967, it has been mandatory to register all births in Norway in
the Medical Birth Registry. This registration includes informa-
tion on congenital anomalies, syndromes, and other medical
conditions diagnosed within the first week after birth; year of
birth; sex; parity; maternal age; and marital status.
The National Insurance Scheme provides health insur-
ance for all residents of Norway, including benefits for people
with medical conditions deemed sufficiently severe to cause
an economic burden and disability pensions for people whose
ability to work is permanently reduced by at least 50%. The
Key Points
Question What is the association between isolated oral clefts and
the risk of adverse health outcomes in the future?
Findings In this registry-based cohort study, little excess
morbidity or mortality was found among children born with an
isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate. Children born with
cleft palate only had increased mortality and increased morbidity
across a range of conditions.
Meaning Children born with isolated cleft lip defects have a low
risk of adverse health outcomes, whereas children with isolated
cleft palate should just be monitored more closely by caretakers.

same person may be granted more than 1 benefit. Diagnoses
were based on medical examinations. Information about mor-
bidity and absence due to sickness was retrieved from the Na-
tional Insurance Scheme. Data from the National Insurance
Scheme were available only from 1992 to 2008. A cleft diag-
nosis alone did not qualify for social security benefits.
The Education Database covers all Norwegians born after
1967. It is updated annually and contains 1 record for each in-
dividual every year since birth. This source provided data re-
garding both the educational level of each individual and the
parents’level of education when members of the study co-
hort were aged 16 years. For individuals who died before that
age, the parents’level of education was collected 16 years af-
ter birth. The parents’level of education was categorized ac-
cordingtotheparentwiththehighesteducationallevel:5years
or more at the university level (master’
s or doctoral degree), 3
years at college or university (bachelor’
s degree), completed
high school, or did not complete high school.
The Cause of Death Registry provided information regard-
ing survival status for all individuals in the cohort and cause
and date of death for those who died during the study period.
Immigration status (0, 1, or 2 parents born in Norway) was pro-
vided by the Central Population Registry. Population charac-
teristics and important health metrics are summarized in
Table 1.
Statistical Analysis
The first step in the analyses was to estimate risk increase for
several different medical conditions and disorders (the eTable
intheSupplementprovidesdetails)foreachofthe3cleftgroups
(CLO, CLP, and CPO) relative to the reference group. These
conditions and disorders included the most common reasons
for obtaining support from the National Insurance Scheme.
Poisson regression analyses with robust error variance14 were
conducted as a numerically robust alternative to log-binomial
regression. Adjustments were done for parents’educational
level, sex, birth year, immigration status, maternal marital sta-
tus, parity, and maternal age. When fewer than 4 individuals in
one of the cleft groups had a condition or disorder, we per-
formedanexactlogisticregressionanalysisusingthecleftgroup
and a sample of 0.1% from the reference group. Adjustments
weredonefortheparents’educationallevel,sex,birthyear,and
maternalmaritalstatus.Thisprocedureofrandomselectionand
analysis was repeated 20 times, and the median odds ratios
(ORs) and median 95% CIs were calculated.
Available information regarding congenital anomalies and
underlying conditions at birth in the cleft group was incom-
plete. Undiagnosed underlying conditions, such as syn-
dromes, may cause intellectual disability.15 Therefore, addi-
tionalsensitivityanalyseswereperformedinwhichweexcluded
all individuals who at some point in life had been granted ben-
efitsforadiagnosisofintellectualdisability.Thisexclusionwas
done to reduce the chance of including individuals with non-
isolated clefts in the study cohort; it does not adhere to a strin-
gentprospectivecohortdesign,sinceinformationobtaineddur-
ing follow-up was used to define the cohort.
Subsequently, Cox proportional hazards regression was
performed with the same adjustment and study variables as
described above and survival curves were plotted. The out-
come was risk of death. These analyses were performed sepa-
rately for nonmedical (eg, accident, murder, and suicide) and
medical (eg, infection and stroke) causes of death. When con-
sidering medical deaths, nonmedical deaths were regarded as
censoring and vice versa.
Survival curves for the risk of an episode of reduced health
(ie, an individual had been granted a disability pension or had
≥8 weeks of continuous absence due to sickness) were esti-
mated for all cleft groups. Individuals who had already experi-
encedanepisodeofreducedhealthattheageof18years(24 632
individuals, with 61 in the cleft group) were excluded from the
analyses.ThiscutoffwaschosenbecausefewNorwegiansstart
their working careers before this age. Deaths were censored.
Hazardratios(HRs)werecalculatedusingCoxproportionalhaz-
ards regression, and the analyses were adjusted for the same
variables as before. The assumption of proportionality for the
Cox models was assessed by creating log − log plots.
Data preparation was conducted using Stata, version 13,16
and statistical analyses were performed in R, version 3.2.2.17
Robust error variance was obtained using sandwich and lmtest
packages,18-20 whereas Cox regressions relied on the survival
package.21
Results
Among 2521 live-born infants with an oral cleft, 184 were ex-
cluded because they were registered as having congenital
anomaliesotherthancleft,hydrocele,andhipdysplasia.These
exclusionswere20individuals(2.8%)withCLO,52(5.4%)with
CLP, and 112 (13.4%) with CPO.
Table 2 reports the relative risks (RRs) of certain medical
conditions and disorders for each cleft group. The CLO group
did not differ significantly in risk from the reference group for
any of the disorders or conditions. The CLP group had an in-
creased risk of intellectual disability (RR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.1)

had an increased risk of intellectual disability (RR, 11.5; 95%
CI, 8.5-15.6), anxiety disorders (RR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3-6.5), au-
tism spectrum disorders (RR, 6.6; 95% CI, 2.8-15.7), severe

10.8), and muscle or skeletal conditions (RR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4-
5.4). In the sensitivity analyses, in which individuals who had
a later diagnosis of intellectual disability were excluded, the
results were mostly similar (Table 2). There were no signifi-
cant risk increases in the CLO group. For the CLP group, the
risk of cerebral palsy was similar in both analyses but no lon-
ger statistically significant (RR, 2.5; 95% CI, 0.9-6.6). The CPO
group still had increased risks for several conditions, but the
risk of epilepsy was halved and not statistically significant (RR,
2.1; 95% CI, 0.5-8.3).
Figure 2 shows survival curves from age 1 year stratified
on medical vs nonmedical causes of death. Regarding indi-
vidualswhodiedfrommedicalcauses(toppanel),onlytheCPO

Asanexample,developmentaldelayisoftennotdiagnosedun-
tilafterseveralyearsofobservation.Wethereforeappliedacom-
mon strategy of removing cases with other congenital anoma-
lies to define groups of isolated CLO, CLP, and CPO. Still, many
congenitalanomaliesarenotasapparentasanoralcleftatbirth
andareoftennotdiagnoseduntilmuchlater.TheMedicalBirth
Registry is not updated with any diagnoses after the first year
oflife;hence,theregistrationofcongenitalanomaliesisnotcom-

ditions, sensitivity analyses were conducted in which all indi-
viduals who had received a diagnosis of intellectual disability
laterinlifewereexcludedfromthestudycohort(Table2).These
sensitivity analyses did not change the main conclusion of the
study.Inbothapproaches,theisolatedCLOandCLPgroupswere
similar to the reference group, whereas the isolated CPO group
had increased health problems in several domains.
The main strength of the present study was its prospec-
tive and population-based cohort design, in which informa-
tionfromcomprehensiveandcompulsoryregistrieswaslinked
forallchildrenborninNorwaywithinthestudyperiod.Thanks
to the unique personal identification number, all individuals
were easily tracked across the registries, reducing loss to fol-
low-up to a minimum. The addition of clinical data ensured
that the same inclusion and exclusion criteria were used
throughout the study period for all children with clefts. This
also holds for the classification of cleft subtypes. Further-
more, treatment for clefts is centralized and free of charge in
Norway, with almost complete birth cohorts as a conse-
quence. Therefore, the included cleft cohorts can be ex-
pected to be highly representative of the Norwegian popula-
tion. In addition, the availability of information about social
confounders was advantageous. Such information is often dif-
ficult to obtain but may be important when studying birth de-
fects.Becauseofthelargesamplesize,mostanalyseswerecon-
ducted with reasonable power.
One previous population-based study22 that reported
health outcomes in the cleft group also adjusted for the pres-
ence of other congenital anomalies and a number of social
confounders. That study found an increased hospitalization
rate in the cleft group, particularly for the CLP and CPO
groups. Hospitalization is, however, expected for surgical
reconstructive procedures of severe clefts, and the study did

not separate these expected hospitalizations from other hos-
pitalizations. Another study23 based on clinical data found
cerebral structural differences between healthy controls and
patients born with an oral cleft. The authors hypothesized
that such differences could be related to an increased preva-
lence of cognitive and social difficulties in the cleft group.24
One may speculate that pathologic embryologic processes
occurring in association with some cleft types (CPO in par-
ticular) could affect cerebral development.
Despite the large sample size, 1 limitation of this study was
that some analyses broke down because of small sub-
samples. There were, for example, no autism cases in the CLO
group (Table 2). Furthermore, in the CLP group, the lower lim-
its of the 95% CIs for the RR of intellectual disability and ce-
rebral palsy were 1.2 and 1.1, respectively. With adjustment for
multiple testing, these RRs would probably be nonsignifi-
cant. The present study cohort also had no participants older
than 43 years at the end of follow-up. In Norway, death and
disabilitybenefitsareexpectedtobelowinindividualsyounger
than43years.Manydiseaseshaveanexpectedonsetwhenper-
sons are in their 50s or older and were therefore not included
in this study. Finally, for some diagnoses, such as schizophre-
nia, expensive drugs are an important part of treatment, trig-
gering benefits from the National Insurance Scheme. Other di-
agnoses,suchaslearningdisabilities,triggerbenefitsonlywhen
symptoms are severe enough to cause an economic burden.
A possible source of bias was that access to information about
morbidity was limited to the Medical Birth Registry and the
National Insurance Scheme. The ascertainment of birth de-
fectsintheMedicalBirthRegistrywasnotcomplete,25andchil-
dren’
s chronic medical conditions were registered in the Na-
tional Insurance Scheme only if the parents had claimed any
benefits. The present study could not answer whether chil-
dren with clefts were more or less likely to receive benefits for
certain conditions compared with otherwise healthy chil-
dren. In addition, bias may have been introduced to the analy-
ses if the 333 individuals in the cleft group who could not be
contacted or declined participation had health risk profiles
other than those of individuals in the study cohort. We had no
opportunity to adjust for potential confounding from mater-
nallifestylefactors(eg,smoking).Thedatasetwasalmostcom-
plete, with less than 0.3% missing data (Figure 1). Hence, in-
dividuals with missing information were excluded from the
analyses. Little bias is expected to result from this exclusion.
Furthermore,somebiasmaybeintroducedbythesmallsample
sizes in some subgroups in Table 2. However, in conducting
additional analyses using exact logistic regression, we found
that the results were similar for all disorders and conditions.
Conclusions
The present results are good news for parents of children with
isolated cleft lip. The study found little evidence that a CLO
was associated with increased mortality or morbidity. The
present findings could also be relevant for counseling of par-
ents who are concerned about the health of their fetus if a cleft
lip is detected on ultrasonography during pregnancy. A fetal
CPO is rarely visible on ultrasonography, whereas CLO and CLP
areeasiertodetect.26Thepresentstudyconfirmspreviousfind-
ings stating that children born with isolated CPO have higher
rates of mortality and morbidity than do individuals in a ref-
erence group. Thorough screening for other underlying con-
ditions in this patient group is highly recommended from a
young age to ensure necessary interventions and treatment as
early as possible.
