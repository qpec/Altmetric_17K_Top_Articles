Abstract
Introduction In Japan, after receiving human papillo-
mavirus vaccination, a significant number of adolescent
girls experienced various symptoms, the vast majority of
which have been ascribed to chronic regional pain syn-
drome, orthostatic intolerance, and/or cognitive dysfunc-
tion. However, a causal link has not been established
between
human
papillomavirus
vaccination
and
the
development of these symptoms.
Objective The aim of this study was to clarify the temporal
relationship between human papillomavirus vaccination
and the appearance of post-vaccination symptoms.
Methods Between June 2013 and December 2016, we
examined symptoms and objective findings in 163 female
patients who had received human papillomavirus vaccina-
tion. We used newly defined diagnostic criteria for accurate
inclusion of patients who experienced adverse symptoms
after human papillomavirus vaccination; these diagnostic
criteria were created for this study, and thus their validity
and reliability have not been established.
Results Overall, 43 female patients were excluded. Among
the remaining 120 patients, 30 were diagnosed as having
definite vaccine-related symptoms, and 42 were diagnosed
as probable. Among these 72 patients, the age at initial
vaccination
ranged
from
11
to
19 years
(average
13.6 ± 1.6 years), and the age at appearance of symptoms
ranged from 12 to 20 years (average 14.4 ± 1.7 years).
The patients received the initial human papillomavirus
vaccine injection between May 2010 and April 2013. The
first affected girl developed symptoms in October 2010,
and the last two affected girls developed symptoms in
October 2015. The time to onset after the first vaccine dose
ranged from 1 to 1532 days (average 319.7 ± 349.3 days).
Conclusions The period of human papillomavirus vacci-
nation considerably overlapped with that of unique post-
vaccination
symptom
development.
Based
on
these
sequential events, it is suggested that human papillo-
mavirus vaccination is related to the transiently high
prevalence of the previously mentioned symptoms includ-
ing chronic regional pain syndrome and autonomic and
cognitive dysfunctions in the vaccinated patients.

 Key Points
Using our new diagnostic criteria for adverse
symptoms after human papillomavirus vaccination,
163 patients with various post-vaccination symptoms
were examined and 72 were diagnosed with human
papillomavirus vaccine-related symptoms.
The main symptoms consisted of chronic regional
pain syndrome, and autonomic and cognitive
dysfunctions. The most frequent objective findings
were orthostatic dysregulation, flattened digital
plethysmography, and focal abnormality of cerebral
blood flow in single-photon emission computed
tomography.
The time to onset after the first vaccine dose showed
a wide range (average 319.7 ± 349.3 days).
The period of human papillomavirus vaccination in
Japan considerably overlapped with that of the
development of unique symptoms in the vaccinated
patients.
1 Introduction
Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been intro-
duced worldwide for the prevention of uterine and cervical
cancer [1, 2]. In May 2010, Cervarix� (GlaxoSmithKline,
Research Triangle Park, NC, USA), a papillomavirus
recombinant bivalent vaccine, and Gardasil� (Merck & Co,
Inc., Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA), a papillomavirus
recombinant quadrivalent vaccine, were widely introduced
for use in female Japanese teenagers, as the cost of this
vaccination was largely borne by several local govern-
ments.
From
April
2013,
female
adolescents
aged
13–16 years were legally required to undergo this vacci-
nation, and its cost was fully covered by the government
[3]. Soon after this law went into effect, a high incidence of
chronic limb pain and weakness, frequently complicated by
violent tremulous involuntary movement, was noted in
Japanese girls after HPV vaccination. According to the
reports of a special committee organized in the Japanese
Ministry of Public Health, Labour and Welfare [4, 5], by
the end of March 2013, 8,646,147 doses of HPV vaccines
had been used in Japan; it was further estimated that 3.28
million girls received this vaccine. Based on medical
institution reports, 1196 cases were reported to have
adverse reactions, of which 106 cases were considered to
be serious. These symptoms were largely reported by the
Japanese mass media as possible adverse events of HPV
vaccination. Additionally, a social community was orga-
nized in Tokyo (All Japan Coordinating Association of
HPV Vaccine Sufferers) [6], and this voluntary community
started to collect more information from all over Japan. At
the end of June 2013, the Japanese Ministry of Public
Health, Labour and Welfare, withdrew the recommenda-
tion for use of this vaccination [7], and our institution was
asked by the ministry to examine these affected adolescent
Japanese girls.
The number of adverse events after HPV vaccination
has been increasing, although the use of this vaccine has
dramatically
decreased
during
the
recent
3.5 years.
According to the latest reports of a Japanese special com-
mittee [8, 9], by the end of November 2016, a total of
8,931,261 doses of HPV vaccines were administered to
about 3.39 million girls in Japan; 2024 cases were reported
to experience adverse reactions, of which 673 were con-
sidered to have serious symptoms. During this term, the
increase in the number of vaccinated girls was about 0.11
million, while that of case reports with serious adverse
reactions was 567. The affected vaccine recipients reported
various symptoms such as intractable headache, long-last-
ing general fatigue, widespread pain involving the limbs,
chest, and abdominal wall, and decreased learning ability;
most of these symptoms were ascribed to orthostatic
intolerance, chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS) [10],
and/or cognitive dysfunction [11]. Moreover, clinical
manifestations of suspected vaccine-related adverse effects
after HPV vaccination have been reported to be ascribed to
abnormal autoimmune reactions [12, 13], but the affected
patients do not present with any characteristic laboratory
findings, including a lack of anti-neural autoantibodies in
serum or cerebrospinal fluid [10].
Demonstrating a causal link between HPV vaccination
and the development of these symptoms is a very chal-
lenging task, particularly because there seem to be few
tools or applicable algorithms to demonstrate direct cau-
sation. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to clarify the
clinical spectrum of HPV vaccine-related symptoms, and
then investigated the temporal relationship between HPV
vaccination and the appearance of these unique symptoms,
which may provide valuable insight into the pathogenesis
of this remarkable phenomenon that occurred after HPV
vaccination.
2 Patients and Methods
Between June 2013 and December 2016, a total of 163
consecutive female patients visited our institution com-
plaining of multiple symptoms after HPV vaccination.
Among them, 114 had undergone vaccination with Cer-
varix� and 43 with Gardasil�. No accurate information was
1220
K. Ozawa et al.
 available on the type of vaccine administered to the
remaining six patients. Using self-reported answers to
printed questionnaires (Electronic Supplementary Material)
for our institute and medical records from other institutes
when available, we obtained a detailed history of the
patients’ symptoms to determine the duration between
vaccination and the development of the first symp-
tom(s) suspected to be related to the vaccine. The patients
underwent complete physical and neurological examina-
tions and routine laboratory screening, including mea-
surement of the serum levels of C-reactive protein.
Patients with hypotension and/or coldness of the limbs
were evaluated with the Schellong test and a digital
plethysmogram.
In
the
Schellong
test,
orthostatic
hypotension was defined as a decrease of more than
20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and/or 5 mmHg in
diastolic pressure within a few minutes after standing [14].
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) was
defined as an increase in heart rate of more than 30 beats
per minute (bpm) within the first 10 min of standing or
tilting the head upwards [15]. A digital plethysmogram was
recorded from the right second finger and right first toe,
while checking the patients’ skin temperature. The digital
plethysmogram findings were evaluated according to the
classification of the wave pattern [16]. The presence of a
peripheral plateau pattern showing a markedly reduced
height of the waves, with loss of a notch in the latter half of
the wave, was judged to be pathological [10]. No standard
diagnostic criterion exists for diminished skin temperature;
therefore, a value below room temperature was considered
abnormal.
Neuropsychological tests and functional brain imaging
were performed in patients who complained of decreased
learning ability and/or memory loss, and those without a
history of any psychiatric or anxiety disorders. The neu-
ropsychological tests used were the Wechsler Adult Intel-
ligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III) and the Trail
Making Test (TMT). The WAIS-III scores were evaluated
using the following intelligence quotient (IQ) scales: full
scale IQ, verbal IQ, performance IQ, verbal comprehension
IQ, working memory IQ, perceptual organization IQ, and
processing speed. A score below 80 on each scale of the
WAIS-III was determined to be abnormal. In the TMT, the
time taken by study patients to complete part B was
compared with the time taken by age-matched controls
[17], and significant prolongation of the time taken to
complete part B (
[
95.0 s average time ±2 standard devi-
ations) was defined as abnormal. Finally, patients with
abnormal results in either the WAIS-III or the TMT were
considered to have impaired cognitive function. Functional
brain imaging was performed using single-photon emission
computed tomography (SPECT). Single-photon emission
computed tomography was performed using a two-head
rotating gamma camera (Symba T6; Siemens, Berlin,
Germany) equipped with parallel hole collimators: these
images were acquired 15 min after intravenous injection of
body
weight
(kg) 9 2.5-3.5 MBq
N-isopropyl-123I-p-
iodoamphetamine. The data obtained from 123I-p-iodoam-
phetamine SPECT were analyzed using the three-dimen-
sional stereotactic surface projection technique to identify
brain regions with abnormal perfusion. Focal hypoperfu-
sion observed in any of the cerebral cortices except the
occipital cortex was considered abnormal. Data are pre-
sented as mean values and standard deviations.
3 Results
For accurate selection of patients affected by suspected
vaccine-related symptoms, we first prepared new diagnos-
tic criteria for vaccine-related adverse events following
HPV vaccination (Table 1) based on our previous report
[10] and the inclusion and exclusion criteria for vaccine-
related adverse events following HPV vaccination pro-
posed by Nishioka et al. [18] and Matsudaira et al. [11].
These diagnostic criteria were created for this study, and
thus their validity and reliability have not been established.
Between June 2013 and December 2016, 163 female
patients were examined (Fig. 1). Of these, we excluded 15
who displayed symptoms before vaccination and four who
received HPV vaccine after the age of 30 years. An addi-
tional 24 patients whose symptoms or disorders were
explainable by known diseases or who had abnormal
results in the laboratory blood tests we conducted were also
excluded: six with epilepsy, five with psychiatric or anxiety
disorders, three with systemic lupus erythematosus, and
two with minor abnormality in routine laboratory data.
Concerning the last two excluded patients, one 17-year-old
patient, who received HPV vaccination at the age of 14
years, was referred to us because of migrating joint pain,
limb shaking, and a slightly elevated C-reactive protein
level (0.74 mg/dL, normal \
0.10 mg/dL). She showed
coldness in the feet but lacked either swelling or redness of
joints and thus, her clinical features indicated HPV vac-
cine-related adverse effects. However, a close assessment
of her laboratory
data suggested juvenile idiopathic
arthritis as the possible cause of her symptoms, not from
adverse effects after HPV vaccination. The other patient
aged 17 years had been experiencing general fatigue,
headache, lower limb pain, and intermittent high fever after
HPV vaccination, and showed cervical and axillar lym-
phadenopathy with an elevated serum C-reactive protein
level (1.40 mg/dL). She seemed to have HPV vaccine-
related adverse effects including reactive lymphadenopa-
thy.
However,
histiocytic

lymphadenitis
(Kikuchi disease), which is occasionally seen in Asian

 adolescent girls, could not be ruled out. Thus, to avoid
possible
biases,
we
applied
strict
exclusion
criteria
including any minor abnormality in routine laboratory data
on this study.
The clinical manifestations and objective findings for
the remaining 120 patients were analyzed according to our
new diagnostic criteria (Table 1): 30 patients were diag-
nosed as having definite vaccine-related symptoms, and 42
were diagnosed as having probable vaccine-related symp-
toms. The summary of symptoms and signs of diagnosed
(definite and probable) and undiagnosed patients are shown
in Table 2, and objective findings for these patients are

 presented in Table 3. The distribution of patients by age at
the initial vaccination and at the appearance of symptoms
is shown in Fig. 2. Among the 72 girls diagnosed as having
definite or probable vaccine-related symptoms, the age at
the initial vaccination ranged from 11 to 19 years (average
13.6 ± 1.6 years; Fig. 2a), the age at the appearance of
symptoms ranged from 12 to 20 years (average 14.4 ± 1.7
years; Fig. 2b), and the time to onset from the first vaccine
dose ranged from 1 to 1532 days (average 319.7 ±
349.3 days). The appearance of symptoms was reported
after the first vaccination in 16.7% of the affected girls,
after the second vaccination in 29.2%, after the third vac-
cination in 52.8%, and unknown in 1.3%. The interval
between the onset of symptoms and our initial examination
ranged from 0 to 63 months (average duration 28.0 ±
15.7 months) and this interval indicated the duration of
illness in the patients until they visited us.
Symptoms or signs frequently observed in these 72 girls
were prolonged general fatigue, chronic headache, wide-
spread pain, limb shaking, dysautonomic symptoms, motor
dysfunction, abnormal sensation, sleep disturbance, learn-
ing impairment, and menstrual abnormality (Table 2). The
affected girls usually stayed in bed until noon because of
marked general fatigue, possibly combined with sleep
disturbance, and upon awakening, they experienced a
continuous headache of varying severity. Dysautonomic
symptoms included frequent squatting or syncope during
their daily activities. Bowel dysfunctions manifested as
frequent abdominal pain with diarrhea or chronic consti-
pation with the abdominal distension. They also experi-
enced widespread pain involving the limbs and trunk. In
the limbs, migratory joint pain with no signs of inflam-
mation was typical, whereas in the trunk, intermittent
neuralgic pain in the chest wall or abdominal wall was
common, and back pain or lumbago was sometimes
observed. Motor dysfunction showed variable patterns:
distal dominant weakness of the limbs, mimicking the
symptoms of polyneuropathy, hemiplegia closely resem-
bling that observed after stroke, and paraplegia or tetra-
paresis.
In
these
conditions,
demonstrable
classical
neurological signs, such as areflexia, exaggerated deep
tendon reflexes, or Babinski sign, were absent. Abnormal
sensations were mainly reported in the thigh or lower legs:
dysesthesia or allodynia was common, and shooting or
burning pain and complaints such as restless leg syndrome
were occasionally reported. However, we did not detect
any objective sensory impairment upon pin-prick or
vibratory stimulations. Regarding learning impairment, the
affected girls claimed that they could not remember long
sentences from their textbooks or understand different
themes simultaneously.

images (Table 3); POTS was detected in half of the girls
with orthostatic dysregulation. In the SPECT images, focal
hypoperfusion areas, which were located mainly in the
medial fronto-parietal and temporo-parietal regions, were
found in 12 of the 16 diagnosed patients who underwent
nuclear scanning of the brain. Corresponding with the
findings of SPECT images, decreased scores on cognitive
function tests were seen: although the WAIS-III scores
showed no consistent abnormality in the patients examined,
a relatively high frequency of decreased scores was
observed in performance IQ (6 of 21 girls; 28.6%),

 perceptual organization IQ (5 of 21; 23.8%), and process-
ing speed test (5 of 21; 23.8%). In the TMT, about half of
the patients tested revealed prolonged times (7 of 16;
43.8%).
Regarding symptom severity of these 72 patients at our
initial examination, 30 patients had symptoms, but they
could independently perform their daily activities including
schoolwork. In 38 patients, daily activities were signifi-
cantly impaired owing to the presence of symptoms: they
were not able to wake in the morning and needed help to
leave home. Four patients were confined to a wheelchair,
and spent most of the day in bed.
We also investigated the temporal relationship between
vaccine administration and the appearance of symptoms in
the 72 girls diagnosed as having definite or probable vac-
cine-related symptoms. The first of three HPV vaccination
injections started in May 2010 and was terminated in April
2013 (Fig. 3a). The first affected girl developed symptoms
in October 2010, and the latest appearance of symptoms
occurred in two girls in October 2015 (Fig. 3b). Over the
previous 14 months, we have not examined any female
patients who were freshly affected by these unique symp-
toms (Fig. 3b).
3.1 Representative Case Report
In November 2014, a 17-year-old girl visited our institution
because of limb pain, memory loss, and decreased calcu-
lation ability. She had received three injections of HPV
vaccine by the end of July 2011. Two months after the third
vaccination, she experienced pain and unpleasant coldness
bilaterally in her shoulders and forearms, sometimes
resulting in difficulty in writing. This symptom lasted for
6 months, followed by spontaneous relief. She subse-
quently experienced marked general fatigue, bowel dys-
function,
tachycardia,
hyperventilation,
and
irregular
menstruation. Since April 2013, a marked increase in the
number of episodes of severe headaches, especially in the
occipital area, was noted. During these headaches, she
experienced short-term asthenia with aphonia, and after
repeated attacks, she experienced transient memory dis-
turbance, including the inability to remember her address
and name, difficulty in concentrating while studying, and
sleep disorder. She underwent computed tomography,
magnetic resonance imaging, and routine blood examina-
tions at other hospitals, all of which revealed no abnor-
malities. Her symptoms resulted in frequent absenteeism at
school in 2014.
Our physical examination revealed that the patient was
159.0 cm tall and weighed 46.1 kg. Her body temperature
was 36.8 �C. Although she appeared to be in an asthenic
state, a general physical examination and neurological
examination showed no abnormality. Results of routine
laboratory tests were all normal. In the Schellong test, her
pulse
rate
was
90 bpm,
with
a
blood
pressure
of
108/65 mmHg in the sitting position. 2 min after standing
up, her pulse rate increased to 129 bpm, without a signif-
icant change of blood pressure, and this tachycardia

 continued for more than 10 min, causing her to squat and
resulting in the termination of the examination. Her skin
temperature was 24.8 �C in the right second finger and
24.0 �C in the right first toe, at a room temperature of
26.5 �C. Plethysmograms of the finger and toe showed
markedly reduced wave heights. Based on her medical
history and our objective findings, we concluded that she
had POTS and disturbed sympathetic innervation on skin,
and we performed further examinations.
Her WAIS-III scores were normal: full scale IQ 107,
verbal IQ 115, performance IQ 95, verbal comprehension
111, working memory 92, perceptual organization 95,
processing speed 84. In contrast, the time taken to complete
part B of the TMT was prolonged (110.46 s; controls\
95.0
s), indicating impaired frontal lobe function. SPECT
showed focal hypoperfusion in both medial parieto-tem-
poral cortices (Fig. 4). She was diagnosed as having cog-
nitive dysfunction and was finally classified as a definite
case because of the presence of nine major symptoms and
five objective findings.
4 Discussion
Vaccinations are generally safe and are expected to sig-
nificantly reduce morbidity and mortality in the targeted
infections, but they occasionally result in some adverse
effects. For example, unexpected adverse effects following
HPV vaccination were reported to the Japanese Ministry of
Public Health, Labour and Welfare during 3 months after
the national vaccination program, including HPV vacci-
nation, started [3], and the mandatory vaccination with
HPV vaccine was terminated at the end of June 2013 [7].
However, a causal relationship between HPV vaccination
and various post-vaccination symptoms is controversial in
Japan [19], and many of the affected girls were initially
diagnosed as having psychiatric illness because of the
absence of pathologic radiological images and specific
abnormalities in laboratory test results. Thus, in this study,
we first proposed new diagnostic criteria for adverse
symptoms after HPV vaccination. Subsequently, using
these criteria, 163 patients with various post-vaccination
symptoms were evaluated and 72 were diagnosed with
HPV vaccine-related symptoms. On the basis of these 72
the clinical spectrum of HPV vaccine-related symptoms
was clarified, adding the frequent objective findings of
orthostatic dysregulation, flattened digital plethysmogra-
phy, and focal abnormality of cerebral blood flow on
SPECT. Finally, we investigated the temporal relationship
between HPV vaccination and the appearance of these
unique symptoms for the purpose of addressing causality,
and have revealed that the period of HPV vaccination in
Japan considerably overlapped with that of the develop-
ment of unique symptoms in the vaccinated patients.
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is
available in USA to monitor the incidence of vaccine-re-
lated adverse events. Analysis of 12,424 Vaccine Adverse
Event Reporting System reports following HPV vaccina-
tion revealed that syncope, dizziness, and headache were
the most prevalent post-vaccination events [20]. The sus-
pected HPV vaccine-related adverse events observed in
this study are largely different from those mentioned
above; estimating from the interval between the onset of
symptoms and patients’ visits to us, adverse events lasted

 for a long time and were severe enough to affect the
patients’ quality of life negatively. The female patients
examined in this study presented with similar histories and
pattern of clinical manifestations as the participants in our
previous study: in our previous report that included 40 girls
with possible HPV vaccine-related adverse effects, com-
mon symptoms were headache, general fatigue, limb pain,
and weakness [10]. All of these symptoms could be
explained by a combination of orthostatic dysregulation
and CRPS [21]. In addition, peripheral sympathetic nerve
dysfunction was responsible for the appearance of ortho-
static dysregulation and CRPS [10, 22]. Recently, cognitive
dysfunction has been noted as a possible adverse effect that
manifests late after HPV vaccination [11]: it manifests
mainly as memory impairment, decreased calculation
ability, and transient prosopagnosia-like symptoms; affec-
ted patients experience difficulties in performing their
schoolwork, with some being absent from school for long
periods. Single-photon emission computed tomography
imaging of the brains of these patients revealed a signifi-
cant reduction in regional cerebral blood flow in func-
tionally related cerebral gyri such as the right medial,
frontal, and/or right rectal gyri [11]. Additionally, patients’
conditions are more complicated with sleep disorders [23]
and
neuro-endocrine
dysfunction
[24].
Furthermore,
abnormal immune responses were observed in cere-
brospinal fluid samples collected from the patients with
cognitive dysfunction [25].
Similar data were reported for patients from Denmark
[26, 27], Italy [28], and the other countries [12, 29–31], and
the pathogenesis of this post-vaccination syndrome has
been postulated to be caused by an autoimmune disorder
including autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by
adjuvants [12, 13, 32]. The clinical characteristics of
autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants
seem to be similar to that of possible HPV vaccine-related
adverse events discussed here [33]. Additionally, causative
autoantibodies for b-2 adrenergic and M2 muscarinic
receptors were also detected in two female POTS patients
with HPV vaccine-related adverse symptoms [34, 35].
In this series of the patients, it is notable that the time to
onset from the first vaccine dose shows a wide range and
the average of that is very long in comparison with the
adverse effects of conventional vaccinations. Another
Japanese research group reported that the time to onset
from the first vaccine dose ranged from 1 day to 43 months
with a mean period of 14.0 ± 11.6 months on the basis of
the investigation of the post-vaccinated 35 girls [24]. Many
symptoms after HPV vaccination are explainable by a
combination of autonomic dysfunction, CRPS, and cogni-
tive dysfunction, and all three disorders are characterized
by insidious onset and progression. It is rather difficult to
determine the exact time of onset in these symptoms. For
example, some patients did not alter their lifestyle even
with general fatigue and limb disorders, and only after
repeated attacks of syncope did they recognize the possible
adverse effects of HPV vaccination. Thus, the interval from
an initial injection of HPV vaccine until the first awareness
of these symptoms may vary among the involved patients.
In the analysis of the temporal relationship between
HPV vaccination and the onset of symptoms, the peak
onset of symptoms in the vaccinated girls occurred at an
age similar to that in girls with HPV vaccination; the dif-
ference in average age between both groups was about
8 months, which is relatively similar to the average interval
of 319.5 days between the first HPV vaccine administration
and the onset of symptoms. Regarding the time course of
HPV vaccination and symptom onset, most of the patients
we examined received HPV vaccination between May
2010 and April 2013, the peak period being between July
2011 and September 2012. However, the development of
symptoms after HPV vaccination in the same group of
patients was between October 2010 and the same month
2015, the peak period being between September 2011 and
August 2013; thus, all these four periods considerably
overlapped, especially for the peak periods of both events.
Therefore, these two events could be related to each other.
Among several iatrogenic disorders after injections,
transmission of human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis
virus to individuals can be demonstrable after the appear-
ance of virus-induced symptoms [36, 37]. Although there is
no tool to obtain direct evidence of the role of HPV vac-
cination in the development of adverse symptoms in the
present study, the time course of symptoms indicates that
the manifestation of HPV vaccine-related symptoms ter-
minated around October 2015, which was 28 months after
the recommendation for HPV vaccination was withdrawn
in Japan. However, POTS or CRPS occasionally develops
in adolescent girls [14, 38], and a questionnaire-based
study performed during July to December in 2015 reported
that a group of symptoms including CRPS and POTS,
which were seen in HPV-vaccinated girls, certainly
occurred in Japanese girls with no history of HPV vacci-
nation and its incidence was at least 5.3/100,000 [39].
This study has some limitations. We were unable to
recruit a satisfactory control group from the general
unvaccinated population. The next limitation is the small
number of study subjects, all of whom were referred to us.
The total number of Japanese girls with HPV vaccine-re-
lated symptoms would be much higher. Further large-scale
studies are needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of this
unusual phenomenon. To this end, a murine pathological
model was recently established by combined administra-
tion of HPV vaccine and pertussis toxin [40], which might
be helpful for investigating immune-related pathological
conditions in this post-vaccinated disorder.

 5 Conclusion
The present study revealed that the age distribution patterns
in female adolescent patients who received HPV vaccina-
tion and that in the female patients who experienced HPV
vaccine-related symptoms are very similar. Moreover, the
period of HPV vaccination in Japan overlapped with that of
the development of HPV vaccine-related symptoms in the
vaccinated patients. Moreover, 28 months have passed
since the recommendation for HPV vaccination was with-
drawn, and new HPV vaccine-related symptoms have not
been observed during our 14-month follow-up period. The
sequence of these events suggests that HPV vaccination is
temporally related to the development of these symptoms
in Japanese adolescent girls. Further large-scale studies are
required to clarify the pathophysiology of these symptoms
and to establish the necessary treatment for affected
patients.
