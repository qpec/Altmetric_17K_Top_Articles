Introduction
In 2015, diarrhoea caused more than 1·3 million deaths 
globally and was the fourth leading cause of death 
among children younger than 5 years.1 Although the 
burden is greatest in low-income populations with poor 
access to safe water, sanitation, and urgent medical care, 
acute infectious diarrhoea is also a common cause of 
outpatient visits and hospital admissions in high-
income regions and is an important health problem 
globally. Prevention and treatment of diarrhoea is 
challenging 
because 
of 
pervasive 
infrastructural, 
political, and socioeconomic barriers, including access 
to safe water and sanitation, education, nutrition, and 
access to health care.2
Estimates of the burden of diarrhoea and its aetiologies 
are being produced annually as part of the Global Burden of 
Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015), 
which provides a unique source for tracking progress in 
reducing morbidity and mortality due to diarrhoea. The 
findings of this study quantify the burden of childhood 
diarrhoea, which will help to track progress toward 
achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 of 
ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all at all 
ages.
Here, we present the results of GBD 2015 for diarrhoea 
and 13 aetiologies covering deaths and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) for 195 countries or territories from 
1990 to 2015 by age and sex. Because of the disproportionate

Summary
Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015) provides an up-to-date 
analysis of the burden of diarrhoeal diseases. This study assesses cases, deaths, and aetiologies spanning the past 
25 years and informs the changing picture of diarrhoeal disease worldwide.
Methods We estimated diarrhoeal mortality by age, sex, geography, and year using the Cause of Death Ensemble 
Model (CODEm), a modelling platform shared across most causes of death in the GBD 2015 study. We modelled 
diarrhoeal morbidity, including incidence and prevalence, using a meta-regression platform called DisMod-MR. We 
estimated aetiologies for diarrhoeal diseases using a counterfactual approach that incorporates the aetiology-specific 
risk of diarrhoeal disease and the prevalence of the aetiology in diarrhoea episodes. We used the Socio-demographic 
Index, a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility, to 
assess trends in diarrhoeal mortality. The two leading risk factors for diarrhoea—childhood malnutrition and unsafe 
water, sanitation, and hygiene—were used in a decomposition analysis to establish the relative contribution of 
changes in diarrhoea disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).
Findings Globally, in 2015, we estimate that diarrhoea was a leading cause of death among all ages (1·31 million 
deaths, 95% uncertainty interval [95% UI] 1·23 million to 1·39 million), as well as a leading cause of DALYs because 
of its disproportionate impact on young children (71·59 million DALYs, 66·44 million to 77·21 million). Diarrhoea 
was a common cause of death among children under 5 years old (499 000 deaths, 95% UI 447 000–558 000). The 
number of deaths due to diarrhoea decreased by an estimated 20·8% (95% UI 15·4–26·1) from 2005 to 2015. 
Rotavirus was the leading cause of diarrhoea deaths (199 000, 95% UI 165 000–241 000), followed by Shigella spp 
(164 300, 85 000–278 700) and Salmonella spp (90 300, 95% UI 34 100–183 100). Among children under 5 years old, the 
three aetiologies responsible for the most deaths were rotavirus, Cryptosporidium spp, and Shigella spp. Improvements 
in safe water and sanitation have decreased diarrhoeal DALYs by 13·4%, and reductions in childhood undernutrition 
have decreased diarrhoeal DALYs by 10·0% between 2005 and 2015.
Interpretation At the global level, deaths due to diarrhoeal diseases have decreased substantially in the past 25 years, 
although progress has been faster in some countries than others. Diarrhoea remains a largely preventable disease and 
cause of death, and continued efforts to improve access to safe water, sanitation, and childhood nutrition will be 
important in reducing the global burden of diarrhoea.

burden of diarrhoea in children younger than 5 years, our 
results and discussion focus on this age group.
Methods
Overview
The general methods for GBD 2015 and earlier GBD 
iterations have been described previously.1,3 Diarrhoea 
burden is measured with several metrics: deaths, episodes, 
and DALYs. DALYs are a sum of years of life lost (YLLs) 
because of premature death and years lived with disability 
(YLDs). DALYs for diarrhoea reflect the acute outcomes of 
the disease. We produced all estimates by year and by age, 
for both sexes, and for all countries. Flowcharts and a 
detailed description for each step of the estimation process 
are provided in the appendix, in accordance with the 
Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates 
Reporting (GATHER). Code for each step of the estimation 
process is available on GitHub.
We used 1000 draws from a posterior distribution of 
each parameter and estimated value to retain uncertainty 
throughout the estimation process. The results are 
presented as mean values with 95% uncertainty intervals 
(95% UIs) representing the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles 
of the distribution.
Mortality
The Global Burden of Disease Cause of Death (CoD) 
database consists of all available data from surveillance 
systems, vital registration systems, and verbal autopsy 
(appendix p 2). Raw data are processed to reconcile 
disparate coding schemes (such as the International 
Classification of Diseases [ICD] 9 and 10) and to redistribute 
poorly coded causes of death, among other corrections.4
We estimated diarrhoeal disease mortality in the Cause 
of Death Ensemble model framework (CODEm).1,5 
CODEm is a spatiotemporal modelling platform that 
produces a wide range of sub-models based on CoD data 
and space–time covariates. Covariates are selected 
independently for each sub-model, and the selection is 
based on an algorithm that captures plausible 
relationships between the covariates and diarrhoeal 
mortality and provides a diverse set of plausible models 
(appendix p 5). These sub-models are evaluated using in-
sample and out-of-sample validity, root mean square 
error, and input datapoint coverage. The best performing 
sub-models provide a greater relative number of draws to 
the final 1000 draws for the model of diarrhoea mortality. 
We assessed our diarrhoeal disease CoD models using in-
sample and out-of-sample predictive performance. This 
modelling process is described in more detail in the 
appendix (p 3).
There is a final step in modelling causes of death called 
CoDCorrect, which ensures internal consistency among 
all causes of death in GBD. Like all mortality models in 
GBD, diarrhoea mortality models are single-cause. The 
sum of all mortality models must be equal to the all-
cause mortality envelope. We corrected diarrhoea 
mortality estimates, and other causes of mortality, by 
rescaling them in accordance with the uncertainty 
around the cause-specific mortality rate.
Morbidity
Diarrhoeal cases are defined as passing three or more 
loose stools in a 24 h period.6 Input data for these models 
were from population representative surveys, hospital 
inpatient and outpatient records (ICD9 codes 001–009.9 
and ICD10 codes A00–A09), health care utilisation (USA 
only), excess mortality from the GBD 2015 CoD estimates 
for diarrhoea, and a systematic literature review of cohort 
and cross-sectional studies (appendix p 9).
We estimated diarrhoeal disease incidence and prevalence 
for each location, age, and sex from 1990 to 2015 using an 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
This manuscript builds on previous GBD publications with 
updated data and methods. Diarrhoeal diseases are a leading 
cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in children younger 
than 5 years, and the global burden has been estimated by several 
groups, including the Maternal and Child Health Epidemiology 
Estimation group and the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 
2013. Diarrhoea mortality has declined substantially since 1990, 
but morbidity has not declined as rapidly. Diarrhoeal mortality 
attributable to aetiologies has mainly been based on categorical 
attribution from non-molecular diagnostic methods with low 
overall attribution. 
Added value of this study
This study provides a comprehensive assessment of diarrhoea 
burden based on the findings of GBD 2015, including new and 
more robust evidence on the mortality, morbidity, and risk 
factors associated with diarrhoea and 13 aetiologies and is the 
first cause-specific description of diarrhoea from the GBD 
group. Moreover, it introduces molecular diagnostic case 
definitions for diarrhoeal aetiologies. In addition to descriptions 
of trends in morbidity and mortality, this analysis uses a 
Socio-demographic Index to relate changes in diarrhoea burden 
to demographic transitions and assesses the effect of changing 
population characteristics and risk factor exposure to 
decompose trends in diarrhoea mortality.
Implications of all the available evidence
This study provides a detailed picture of the decreasing 
diarrhoeal burden over time and 13 aetiologies across all 
geographies while relating these trends to changes in risk factor 
exposure. This work allows for an in-depth understanding of 
national health challenges and areas for intervention. The 
findings will have great implications for strategies and 
programmes to address the burden of diarrhoea at the global, 
country, and local level.

age-integrating meta–regression tool called DisMod-MR 2.1 
(DisMod) which has been described in more detail 
previously3,7,8 and in the appendix (p 7). DisMod adjusts for 
variations in study methods between data sources and 
enforces consistency between data for different parameters 
such as incidence and prevalence. Incidence, prevalence, 
remission, and excess mortality are dependent in a 
compartmental model of disease progression. Geospatial 
priors, space–time covariates, random effects, and input 
data predict incidence and prevalence of diarrhoea. The tool 
evaluates epidemiological data on diarrhoea burden 
through a geographical cascade of four levels from global, 
where fixed effects for covariates are established, to the 
smallest geographical estimation unit. Outputs from larger 
geographical units of the cascade are used as priors in 
smaller subunits within the same geography. DisMod uses 
geographically representative random effects to produce 
estimates in areas with sparse data.3
Diarrhoeal diseases have three severity levels: mild, 
moderate, and severe (appendix p 10). To estimate YLDs 
from diarrhoeal diseases, we calculated a disability weight 
for each of the diarrhoea severity levels and the percentage 
of cases that fall into each state (appendix p 10). DALYs are 
the sum of YLLs and YLDs and represent the cumulative 
burden of disease due to diarrhoea.9
Aetiologies
We estimated diarrhoeal disease aetiologies separately 
from overall diarrhoea mortality. Aetiologies included 
enteric adenovirus (serotypes 40 and 41), Aeromaons spp, 
Entamoeba histolytica (amoebiasis), Campylobacter spp 
enteritis 
(Campylobacter), 
cryptosporidiosis 
(Cryptosporidium 
spp), 
typical 
enteropathogenic 
Escherichia coli (tEPEC), enterotoxigenic E coli (ETEC; 
both 
ST 
and 
LT), 
norovirus, 
non-typhoidal 
Salmonella 
spp, 
 
rotaviral 
enteritis 
(rotavirus), 
shigellosis (Shigella spp), Vibrio cholerae (cholera), and 
Clostridium difficile. The modelling strategy for 
diarrhoeal aetiologies is described in more detail in the 
appendix (pp 11–26).
We used a counterfactual approach that allows for 
interactions between pathogens and accounts for the 
distribution of pathogens in healthy individuals. We 
estimated a population attributable fraction (PAF), for 
each aetiology, which is the product of pathogen presence 
and the odds ratio (OR) of diarrhoea given its detection:10
Where OR is the OR of diarrhoea given the presence of a 
pathogen and Proportion is the modelled proportion of 
diarrhoea episodes where the pathogen is present.
For GBD 2015, we used a systematic reanalysis of the 
Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS)11,12 that used 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as the 
diagnostic tool for pathogen detection to estimate the ORs 
of diarrhoea given pathogen detection. GEMS is a seven 
site, case-control study of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in 
children younger than 5 years in south Asia and sub-
Saharan Africa. Validation studies have shown that the use 
of molecular diagnostics is more sensitive than is 
traditional laboratory diagnostic methods for the detection 
of diarrhoeal pathogens.13,14 We used a mixed-effects 
conditional logistic regression model, matching for case-
control pairs, random effects for GEMS sites, and 
accounting for all pathogens to calculate the OR by age for 
each of our aetiologies. OR did not vary by time or 
geography, a change from GBD 2013 when we used 
region-specific ORs.15
We did a systematic literature review of the proportion of 
diarrhoea cases that tested positive for each aetiology 
(appendix p 19) and used the meta-regression tool DisMod-
MR to model the proportion of positive diarrhoea cases, 
for each aetiology separately, by location, year, age, and sex. 
We used rotavirus vaccine coverage as a covariate in the 
rotavirus proportion model only. Because most of the 
studies published on this topic used a case definition 
based on non-molecular diagnostics, we used the 
sensitivity and specificity of these methods compared with 
our qPCR case definition (appendix p 15) to correct the 
proportion estimates for exposure misclassification due to 
diagnostic error.16,17
We estimated a distinct fatal and non-fatal PAF for 
each aetiology assuming that diarrhoea episodes with 
hospital admission are a reasonable proxy for the cause 
of fatal cases since data on the cause of diarrhoea 
mortality after death were not available. Finally, we 
multiplied PAFs by the fatal and non-fatal diarrhoea 
envelopes to establish cases and deaths by aetiology.
We modelled V cholerae independently from the other 
aetiologies because of its epidemic tendency and 
imperfect reporting frequency. We used a systematic 
literature review to estimate the expected number of 
cholera cases for each country–year. We compared this 
expected number of cholera cases to the number reported 
to WHO and used this under-reporting fraction to correct 
the cholera case notification data for all countries.18 We 
modelled the case fatality ratio of cholera using DisMod-
MR and applied these values to the cholera case envelope 
to estimate the number of cholera deaths.
We also modelled C difficile independently from the 
aetiologies because it was not included as a pathogen in 
GEMS. We did a systematic literature review for the 
prevalence and incidence of C difficile and used inpatient 
and outpatient hospital visits coded for C difficile. We 
modelled the natural history of C difficile infection, 
including incidence and mortality, in DisMod-MR for 
each location, year, age, and sex.

Risk factor decomposition
Risk factors for diarrhoeal diseases are modelled as part 
of GBD 2015 and have been described in detail 
previously.19,20 Risk factors are different from diarrhoea 
model covariates. Briefly, risk factors also follow a PAF 
counterfactual approach in which the prevalence of 
exposure is modelled from scientific literature and 
population representative surveys, and the relative risk of 
diarrhoea given risk exposure is taken from published 
meta-analyses. Although there are ten total risk factors 
for diarrhoea in GBD 2015, we used only the two leading 
risk factors for diarrhoea DALYs, unsafe water and 
sanitation 
and 
childhood 
undernutrition, 
in 
a 
decomposition analysis of the change in DALYs due to 
diarrhoea from 2005 to 2015. The decomposition is of 
five factors that contribute interdependently to diarrhoea 
burden, including undernutrition exposure, unsafe 
water or sanitation exposure, population growth, 
population ageing, and the underlying rate of DALYs 
from diarrhoea unexplained by the other factors. A 
combinatorial process calculates the relative contribution 
of each of these five factors to the change in diarrhoea 
DALYs.20,21 These analyses are not done at the draw level 
so uncertainty is not propogated through the risk factor 
decomposition.
Burden transition with development
Based on methods used to construct the Human 
Development Index, GBD 2015 used the Socio-
demographic Index (SDI), a summary measure of 
development based on lag-dependent income per capita, 
average educational attainment, and total fertility rate.1,22 
We used age-standardised estimates of the diarrhoea 
mortality rate for each year and most detailed 
geographical location to calculate the relationship 
between SDI and diarrhoea mortality using a simple 
least-squares regression with a cubic spline.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of

Results
In 2015, diarrhoeal diseases were responsible for 
1·31 million deaths (95% UI 1·23 million to 1·39 million; 
table 1). Among children younger than 5 years, 
diarrhoeal diseases were responsible for 499 000 deaths 
(447 000–558 000; table 1), representing 8·6% (7·7–9·5) 
of the 5·82 million deaths in this age group.1 Diarrhoea 
was the ninth leading cause of death among all ages and 
the fourth leading cause among children younger than 
5 years, behind preterm birth complications, neonatal 
encephalopathy, and lower respiratory infections.1 At the 
global level, the diarrhoea mortality rate for children 
younger than 5 years in 2015 was 74·3 deaths (95% UI 
66·6–83·0) per 100 000 and was slightly different 
between boys (74·1 deaths [64·4–85·1] per 100 000) and 
girls (74·5 deaths [65·0–85·5] per 100 000). Figure 1 
shows mortality rates due to diarrhoea for children 
younger than 5 years by geography in 2015 and figure 2 
shows all age mortality by geography. Under-5 mortality 
from diarrhoea was highest in sub-Saharan Africa and 
south Asia. Between 2005 and 2015, the number of 
deaths due to diarrhoea decreased by 34·3% (24·9–42·3) 
among children younger than 5 years and decreased by 
20·8% among all ages (15·4–26·1). Figure 3 shows the 
rate of change in under-5 deaths due to diarrhoea 
between 2005 and 2015.
Mortality from diarrhoea varied by location. The 
highest rates of under-5 mortality due to diarrhoea were 
in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, in particular in 
Chad (594 deaths [95% UI 392–827] per 100 000) and 
Niger (485 deaths [330–677] per 100 000; figure 1). 
However, due to their moderate-to-high burden and large 
populations, India (105 000 deaths, 90 000–122 000) and 
Nigeria (103 000 deaths, 73 000–136 000) combined had 
42% of the 499 000 global under-5 deaths due to diarrhoea 
in 2015 (table 1).
The mortality rate due to diarrhoea decreased by 39·2% 
(95% UI 24·0–51·2) among children younger than 
5 years between 2005 (122·1 deaths [109·3–136·5] per 
100 000) and 2015 (74·3 deaths [66·6–83·0] per 100 000) 
but with variation by region, which is shown against the 
SDI for each region in Figure 4A. Between 2005 and 
2015, the fastest reductions in under-5 mortality rate due 
to diarrhoea were in east Asia and tropical and Andean 
Latin America (>65% reduction during this time period). 
The greatest absolute reduction in mortality rate due to 
diarrhoea was in sub-Saharan Africa. The diarrhoea 
mortality rate decreased by more than 100 deaths 
per 100 000 in western sub-Saharan Africa (from 
445 to 277 deaths per 100 000), eastern sub-Saharan Africa 
(from 243 to 131 deaths per 100 000), and southern sub-
Saharan Africa (from 214 to 113 deaths per 100 000; 
figure 3). Under-5 diarrhoea incidence decreased more 
slowly than did diarrhoea mortality due to diarrhoea 
(figure 4B). At the global level, diarrhoea incidence in this 
age group decreased by 10·4% (95% UI 9·1–11·6) 
between 2005 and 2015. Diarrhoea incidence decreased 
the fastest in western and eastern sub-Saharan Africa but 
was largely unchanged in the high-income super-region 
(figure 4B).
We estimated that there were 2·39 billion (95% UI 
2·30 billion to 2·50 billion) episodes of diarrhoea in 2015, 
of which 957·5 million (871·1 million to 1·0575 billion) 
occurred in children younger than 5 years (table 1). From 
2005 to 2015, diarrhoea incidence decreased by 10·4% 
(9·1–11·6) in children under-5 and by 5·9% (5·0–6·7) 
among all ages and both rates of change were less than the 
declines in mortality rates. In 2015, diarrhoeal diseases 
caused 71 590 000 DALYs (66 443 000–77 206 000) with most

occurring in children younger than 5 years (45 109 000, 
40 694 000–50 119 000; table 1). Most DALYs due to 
diarrhoea are from YLLs (65 858 000 [92·0%] DALYs due 
to diarrhoea).
Diarrhoeal episodes and deaths were attributed to 
13 pathogens in GBD 2015. Aetiologies could be 
established for 96·1% of all deaths due to diarrhoea in 
children younger than 5 years and 72·0% of diarrhoeal 
deaths at all ages. The three most common aetiologies to 
which diarrhoea mortality was attributed in 2015 among 
children 
younger 
than 
5 
years 
were 
rotavirus 
(146 000 deaths, 95% UI 118 000–183 000; 29·3%, 
24·6–35·9), Cryptosporidium spp (60 400 deaths, 13 709·1–
134 506·4; 
12·1%, 
2·8–26·9), 
and 
Shigella 
spp 
(54 900 deaths, 27 000–94 700; 11·0%, 5·5–18·7%;), which 
combined accounted for more than 50% of deaths due to 
diarrhoea in this age group (table 2). Figure 5 shows the 
number of under-5 deaths by aetiology and geography in 
2015. Adenovirus was an important cause of death in 
children younger than 5 years, accounting for 9·2% 
(3·3–19·7) of deaths due to diarrhoea in this age group 
(46 000 deaths, 16 200–97 700). Among children aged 
5–14 years, V cholerae was the leading cause of death 
(12 814 deaths, 9031–16 943; 24·8%, 17·6–32·3) and 
Shigella spp were the leading cause of death among 
adults aged 15–99 years (100 013 deaths, 47 119–173 200; 
13·1%, 6·7–21·0).
Rotavirus was the leading cause of diarrhoea mortality 
in children younger than 5 years in most countries; 
among the ten countries with the highest diarrhoea 
mortality burden, only Pakistan and Ethiopia had 
leading causes of of diarrhoeal death that were not 
rotavirus (table 2). Between 2005 and 2015, rotavirus 
deaths among children younger than 5 years decreased 
by 44% (95% UI 33·0–52·0), representing the only 
aetiology for which the attributable fraction significantly 
decreased among children under-5 during this time. 
Rotavirus was also an important cause of diarrhoeal 
death at older ages—nearly 23% of rotavirus deaths 
occurred in people older than 5 years old (52 697 deaths, 
47 400–57 700) and it was responsible for 199 000 deaths 
among all ages (165 000–241 000). Cryptosporidium spp 
were one of the leading causes in most of sub-Saharan 
Africa, but almost exclusively among children younger 
than 5 years; 93% of the 64 818 Cryptosporidium spp 
deaths occurred in children younger than 5 years. 
Shigella spp were notably different from rotavirus and 
Cryptosporidium spp in that only a third of their 
164 300 deaths (95% UI 85 000–278 700) were in children 
younger than 5 years.
C difficile was the main aetiology of diarrhoeal death in 
high-income countries at all ages (figure 5) and was the 
only aetiology that increased in attributable fraction 
between 2005 and 2015 (39·8% increase, 95% UI 
29·6–49·9), particularly among adults aged 70 years or 
older (60·8% increase, 49·0–71). Cholera mortality 
patterns have distinct geographic variation with the 
highest attributable fractions in sub-Saharan Africa and 
southeast Asia (figure 5).
The leading risk factors for diarrhoea were unchanged 
from 2005 to 2015. In 2015, unsafe water was responsible for 
61·1 million DALYs (95% UI 49·4 million to 69·6 million; 
85·4% of diarrhoeal DALYs) and unsafe sanitation was 
responsible for 40·0 million DALYs (36·0 million to 
44·4 million). Among children younger than 5 years, wasting 
was the leading risk factor for DALYs due to diarrhoea, 
responsible for 86·3% (72·3–91·4; 38·9 million DALYs, 
31·8–44·3) of the 45·1 million diarrhoea DALYs (40·7–50·1). 
Other risk factors for children were also responsible for 
under-5 DALYs, such as suboptimal breastfeeding (35·7%, 
24·6–46·75), vitamin A deficiency (12·9%, 7·3–18·6), and 
zinc deficiency (6·5%, 0·6–13·8). The number of DALYs 
due to diarrhoea decreased for most countries between 2005 
and 2015 (figure 6, figure 7, and figure 8 and table 1). 
Reductions in childhood undernutrition prevalence and 
improvements in safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) 
have appreciably contributed to reductions in diarrhoea 
DALYs in many countries (figure 6–8). At the global level, 
between 2005 and 2015, diarrhoea DALYs attributable to 
unsafe water and poor sanitation have decreased by 13·4% 
and those attributable to childhood undernutrition have 
decreased 10·0% during this time.
Diarrhoea DALYs attributable to unsafe WaSH decreased 
in all countries, with the greatest reduction in Vietnam 
(35·2%; figure 6B), but sub-Saharan Africa lagged 
in WaSH-related diarrhoea DALYs, where the global 
minimum change occurred in the Central African 
Republic (0·6%; figure 7B). Outside high-income regions, 
the smallest reductions in DALYs attributable to WaSH 
were in eastern sub-Saharan Africa (7·2% reduction) and 
the Caribbean (7·2% reduction). The largest regional 
reductions in DALYs attributable to WaSH occurred in 
South America: the decrease was 28·3% in southern Latin 
America and 20·8% in Andean Latin America. DALYs due 
to diarrhoea attributable to childhood undernutrition 
decreased 
in 
most 
countries, 
ranging 
from 
a 
29·3% decrease in Zimbabwe to a 9·3% increase in Egypt, 
with 
substantial 
reductions 
in 
DALYs 
due 
to 
undernutrition-associated diarrhoea in many countries of 
sub-Saharan Africa, including the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo, Kenya, and Burkina Faso (figure 7B). The 
largest regional reductions in DALYs due to childhood 
undernutrition were in central sub-Saharan Africa 
(21·7% reduction) and the Caribbean (19·7% reduction).

Figure 4: Trends in under-5 
diarrhoea mortality and 
incidence and SDI by region, 
1990–2015
The diarrhoea mortality rate 
per 100 000 population (A) 
and incidence per child-year 
(B) for each region is shown. 
Points represent 5 year 
increments from 1990 to 
2015. The black line is a least-
squares cubic spline regression 
using the age-standardised 
diarrhoea mortality rate for 
each geographic location and 
represents the expected rate 
based on SDI alone, where 
estimates above the black line 
are higher than expected and 
those below are lower than 
expected on the basis of SDI 
alone. More information on 
the formulation and theory of 
the SDI is available in the GBD 
2015 cause of death capstone 
paper.1 SDI=Socio-
demographic Index. 
GBD=Global Burden of 
Disease.

Discussion
GBD 2015 provides the most comprehensive assessment 
of the global burden of diarrhoeal diseases to date. The 
results show that deaths due to diarrhoea among children 
younger than 5 years decreased by 34·3% between 2005 
and 2015 and decreased by 20·8% among people of all 
ages. Despite substantial reductions, diarrhoea remains 
an important preventable burden of disease, particularly 
in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. With immediate 
and sustained actions to decrease both the incidence and 
mortality attributed to diarrhoea, including appropriate 
case management, the burden of this prominent public 
health threat could still be further substantially 
reduced.23,24
Rotavirus is the most common cause of mortality due to 
diarrhoea. Between 2005 and 2015, under-5 mortality due 
to rotavirus decreased by 43·6%, faster than the decrease 
in all-diarrhoea mortality. This decrease is probably due 
in large part to the introduction of rotavirus vaccine and 
the scale-up of vaccination related to support from Gavi,

the Vaccine Alliance. With Gavi support by the end of 
2015, 37 countries had introduced the vaccine, but only 
about 20% of under-5 children in Gavi-eligible countries 
have received the rotavirus vaccine.25 As of March, 2017, 
91 countries have introduced the rotavirus vaccine.26
Our results suggest that development of additional 
vaccines might be warranted. Cryptosporidium spp were 
the second most common cause of diarrhoea deaths 
among children younger than 5 years. Few therapeutic 
options for Cryptosporidium spp exist27 and there are no 
vaccine candidates, an apparent gap in treatment and 
prevention. Several candidate combination vaccines 
against ETEC and Shigella spp are in development28 and 
such a vaccine might prevent a large burden of 
diarrhoeal disease, including in older children and 
adults given that nearly two-thirds of deaths due to 
Shigella spp occurred in adults and children older than 
5 years.

The reduction in DALYs due to diarrhoea is largely 
attributable to reductions in mortality and can probably 
be traced to improvements in treatment and prevention, 
such as reductions in childhood undernutrition 
prevalence and expanded access to safe water and 
sanitation.24,29 Our results suggest that large strides in 
reducing childhood undernutrition, especially in tropical 
Latin America and some countries in sub-Saharan Africa, 
as well as increasing access to safe water and sanitation 
such as in south and southeast Asia, have contributed to 
substantial reductions in diarrhoeal DALYs. Reducing 
exposure to these risk factors was a key focus of the 
Millennium Development Goals and is included in the 
SDGs (figures 6–8).
In GBD 2015, water and sanitation are modelled as 
polytomous risk factors (eg, piped, chlorinated) compared 
with a dichotomous variable, such as improved or 
unimproved water and sanitation sources as defined

by the Joint Monitoring Programme.30 Despite large 
improvements in safe sanitation, our results suggest that 
use of safe water has increased only slightly.20 Interventions 
that focus on provision of improved water sources without 
regard for the transport and treatment of the water are less 
effective than are infrastructural improvements in water 
provision, such as piped and chlorinated systems.20
Childhood undernutrition is a risk factor for infectious 
diseases other than diarrhoea, including lower respiratory 
infections and measles.31 The reduction in childhood 
undernutrition is therefore crucial to decreasing under-5 
mortality, and direct interventions, such as improved 
agriculture and supplementary nutritional programmes, 
and indirect interventions, such as encouraging lower 
fertility rates and expanded maternal education, are 
rightly emphasised in SDG 2.32,33

associated with diarrhoea has not decreased nearly as 
fast, suggesting that much of this reduction might be 
attributable to appropriate case management including 
access to health care and the use of oral rehydration 
solution.34 The effectiveness of oral rehydration solution 
in the prevention of severe dehydration and death further 
emphasises the fact that diarrhoea-attributable mortality 
is largely preventable, even in low-resource settings, with 
appropriate treatment.
The GBD 2015 estimates of diarrhoea mortality in 
children younger than 5 years in 2015 (498 900, 95% UI 
447 500–557 600) are slightlty lower than those 
produced by the WHO Department of Evidence, 
Information and Research and the Maternal and Child 
Epidemiology Estimation (MCEE) group (526 000; 
appendix p 35).35 The total envelope for under-5 
mortality was nearly 1·5 million fewer deaths in 
GBD 2015 compared with the MCEE group estimates. 
A comparison of aetioloies for diarrhoea-attributable 
mortality among children younger than 5 years 
between the Child Health Epidemiology Research 
Group (CHERG), from which the MCEE developed,36 
and GBD 2015 estimates for the year 2010, is shown in 
the appendix (p 34).
There are several reasons to use counterfactual analyses 
for the attribution of diarrhoea aetiologies. First, multiple 
pathogens can be present in a single case of diarrhoea, 
and these pathogens might interact with each other, 
making it difficult to attribute each case of diarrhoea to 
one pathogen.11,13 Second, the presence of a given 
pathogen might not be directly related to diarrhoea. For 
example, the same pathogens might exist in stool from a 
healthy individual and from someone with diarrhoea, so 
simply measuring the presence of a given pathogen 
might not accurately describe diarrhoea burden.11 By 
engaging in scientific debate and learning from the 
categorical attribution approach used in previous 
iterations of GBD (2010),37 we decided to use a 
counterfactual approach in future work. Unlike 
categorical attribution that assigns one outcome to one 
aetiology, counterfactual analyses allow for multicausality 
of diarrhoea episodes.
Comparison with GBD 2013
The GBD 2015 estimates of diarrhoea burden differ 
from those of previous GBD iterations, including 
cause attribution. Global under-5 deaths due to 
diarrhoea in 2010, the most recent shared estimation 
year, are generally lower in GBD 2015 compared with 
GBD 2013 estimates. These differences can be traced 
to three high-population and high-burden countries: 
Pakistan, Nigeria, and India (appendix).15 GBD 
estimates in India are now made at the subnational 
level, which has added data and geographic resolution 
to this country. This modelling change in India has 
also reduced the non-fatal diarrhoea estimates in the 
country (appendix).
Diagnostics
For GBD 2015, we have updated our case definitions for 
the diarrhoeal aetiologies to reflect detection using 
molecular methods. This advancement of molecular 
diagnostic tools enables identification of pathogens that 
may have previously gone undetected and can more 
accurately determine the prevalence of pathogens.13,38 
These diagnostics are more sensitive in pathogen 
detection 
than 
traditional 
laboratory 
methods, 
particularly for bacterial organisms,13 and could allow for 
improvements in case management, epidemiological 
tracking, and assessing the effectiveness of interventions, 
such as vaccines. To adopt a molecular diagnostic case 
definition for our diarrhoeal aetiologies, we introduced a 
source of uncertainty in our estimates because of the 
necessity of adjusting our estimates of the proportion of 
diarrhoea episodes that test positive for each aetiology, 
according to the non-molecular diagnostic methods, for 
mis 
classi 
fication of exposure.39
Data limitations
Our estimates of diarrhoea mortality, morbidity, and 
cause attribution are limited by data availability, especially 
the sparsity of data in sub-Saharan Africa, the region of 
the world with the highest diarrhoea burden. It is difficult 
to assess a systematic bias in morbidity or mortality 
estimates caused by data gaps because it is not clear that 
missing data in some countries means that deaths due to 
diarrhoea are disproportionally higher or lower compared 
with other preventable causes. We account for 
confounding effects of diarrhoea and other causes by 
making use of regional information to inform the fraction 
of all-cause mortality attributable to diarrhoea. Data 
sparsity is also reflected in the uncertainty interval for the 
particular geography (table 1). A list of all GBD 2015 data 
sources is available for each country online. The MAL-ED 
study will be a great resource in elucidating the burden of 
community diarrhoea and its aetiologies, especially in 
Africa and Latin America.40,41 There is also a general dearth 
of data on diarrhoea in populations older than 5 years, 
and although we model diarrhoeal aetiologies in these 
age groups, the OR from the oldest age group in GEMS, 
which is still younger than 5 years (2–5 years), are 
assumed to be representative in older ages.42 Moreover, 
our statistical models have a limitation in predicting cases 
based on very small numbers or when data are absent.
ETEC estimates in GBD 2015 represent the combined 
burden of the ST and LT genotypes, of which ST is 
recognised 
as 
more 
frequently 
associated 
with 
diarrhoea.43 Although the OR of diarrhoea given detection 
would be higher for ST if the genotypes were to be 
differentiated, there would be a tradeoff in the proportion 
of diarrhoea episodes that test positive for ST-ETEC. The 
modelling strategy for cholera attribution is limited by 
case reporting to WHO. Although cholera is a notifiable 
disease to WHO, many countries underreport or fail to 
report at all for various social and economic reasons.18

Next steps
Malnutrition or regular illness during the first few years of 
life has negative effects on future cognitive development, 
education, and productivity. Despite being the fourth most 
common cause of DALYs in children younger than 5 years 
globally, the full burden of non-fatal diarrhoea might 
remain unknown.44,45 Results from many studies have 
implicated diarrhoea as a risk factor for malnutrition and 
impaired physical growth, while others have suggested that 
diarrhoea, possibly mediated by malnutrition, might also 
impair cognitive development.46–48 Capturing these sequelae 
by cause will increase the quantified burden of diarrhoea to 
more completely measure its effects on child health and 
potential. Future iterations of GBD will incorporate 
geospatial data on diarrhoeal burden to map the 
spatiotemporal distribution of diarrhoea and its aetiologies 
on a 5 km by 5 km geographic scale, as has been done for 
malaria.49 This work will provide important insight into 
higher spatial resolution space-time trends in diarrhoea.
Conclusion
Despite substantial reductions in diarrhoea mortality in 
many countries, the burden of this preventable disease 
remains concentrated in the poorest children. Under-
standing the contribution of each cause to the burden of 
diarrhoea and how this varies geographically will enable 
interventions to be targeted. Vaccine use and a continued 
focus on improving access to WaSH indicators, reducing 
childhood undernutrition, and providing appropriate 
treatment 
and 
case 
management 
will 
accelerate 
reductions in diarrhoea disease burden.
