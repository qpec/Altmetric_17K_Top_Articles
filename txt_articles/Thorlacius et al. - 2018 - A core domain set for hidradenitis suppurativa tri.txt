Abstract
Background—There is no consensus on core outcome domains for hidradenitis suppurativa 
(HS). Heterogeneous outcome measure instruments in clinical trials likely leads to outcome 
reporting bias and limits the ability to synthesise evidence.

 Objectives—To achieve global multi-stakeholder consensus on a Core Outcome Set (COS) of 
domains regarding what to measure in clinical trials for HS.
Methods—Six stakeholder groups participated in a Delphi process which included five 
anonymous e-Delphi rounds and four face-to-face consensus meetings to reach consensus on the 
final COS. The aim was for a 1:1 ratio of patients: Health Care Professionals (HCPs).
Results—A total of 41 patients and 52 HCPs from 19 countries in four continents participated in 
the consensus process which yielded a final COS that included five domains: pain, physical signs, 
HS specific quality of life, global assessment and progression of course. A sixth domain, 
symptoms, was highly supported by patients and not by healthcare professionals but is 
recommended for the core domain set.
Conclusions—Routine adoption of the COS in future HS trials should ensure that core 
outcomes of importance to both patients and HCPs are collected.
INTRODUCTION
Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease with an estimated 
prevalence of 0.1–4 % worldwide.1–4 The primary lesions are inflammatory nodules that 
may develop into abscesses and sinus tracts with subsequent scarring, affecting flexural sites 
such as the axillae and groins on a recurrent basis5,6 Lesions of HS are typically described 
by patients as painful boils which, along with associated pus and odour, may produce a large 
impact on quality of life.7–11
Interventions for HS are diverse and include topical treatment, systemic antibiotics, 
retinoids, immunomodulatory oral therapy, biologics, laser therapy and surgery.12,13 The 
level of evidence for existing treatments is low, suggesting a particular need for more clinical 
trials in HS.13
Validated outcome measure instruments are necessary to ensure that study results are 
comparable and that, as a consequence, patients receive the most effective interventions. For 
HS, numerous outcome measure instruments exist, with a total of 30 instruments used in the 
12 randomised controlled trials included in the recent Cochrane review.13, 14 Heterogeneity 
of outcome measure instruments in HS limits evidence synthesis, including meta-analysis,13 
and likely leads to outcome reporting bias because of selective reporting of more favourable 
outcomes.15 Because no consensus on core outcomes for HS exists, researchers use various 
instruments, which may or may not be valid. Furthermore, current instruments emphasize 
clinical features with limited incorporation of patient-reported outcomes, despite 
recommendations emphasizing the importance of the patient perspective in outcomes 
research.16
To tackle these issues, the HIdradenitis SuppuraTiva cORe outcomes set International 
Collaboration (HISTORIC) was formed as a collaboration between the International 
Dermatology Outcome Measures (IDEOM) initiative, the Cochrane Skin Group - Core 
Outcome Set Initiative (CSG-COUSIN) and Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde. The first 
HISTORIC goal was to develop a Core Outcome set (COS) of domains that is relevant to all

 major stakeholders, including patients, to be recommended for use in all subsequent HS 
clinical trials.17–19
We performed and moderated an international multi-perspective Delphi consensus project 
with a scope to develop a COS suitable for all HS clinical trials. The COS is intended to suit 
all types of interventions for all HS patients, regardless of setting or mode of administration.
METHODS
The study is reported in accordance with the newly developed Core Outcome Set STAndards 
for Reporting (COS-STAR).20 A detailed description of the methods can be found in our 
protocol article.21 Methodological guidance was followed from Core Outcome Measures in 
Effectiveness Trials (COMET)19 and Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT).22 
We were also guided by the Harmonizing Outcome Measures for Eczema (HOME) 
roadmap.23 The methodology involves a stepwise approach for the development of a COS. 
The first step is to identify which domains one should measure and report in all clinical 
controlled trials of a specific condition (what to measure: the core domain set).15 The second 
step is to identify the instruments that should be used to assess these domains (how to 
measure: the core outcome measurement set).17,19 The present study achieved the first step, 
determining what to measure.
Participants
The involvement of multiple stakeholders for the development of a COS is strongly 
recommended by methodologists.17,19,23,24 Six groups of stakeholders were invited to 
participate in our development process: patients, dermatology HS experts, surgical HS 
experts, HS nurses, industry representatives and drug regulatory authorities. Patients were 
analysed as one stakeholder group and the remaining stakeholder groups were combined into 
a second group referred to as Health Care Professionals (HCPs). The HCP group contained 
one representative of a drug regulatory authority (the European Medicines Agency) and one 
industry representative (table 3). Other drug regulators and pharmaceutical companies with 
an interest in HS were contacted but chose not to contribute. The aim was for a 1:1 ratio of 
patients: HCPs.
Patients were identified through patient associations and via dermatologists with a special 
interest in HS in countries without a formal patient association. HCPs were identified from 
the community of HCPs working with HS patients. A clinical background of at least five 
years of experience managing HS was required for all HCPs and publications on HS or 
participation in scientific meetings on HS was required for dermatologists.
Information sources
Identification of initial list of candidate items and potential core domains—The 
initial list of candidate items was obtained in a three-step manner:
1: Systematic review of literature: A recent systematic Cochrane review on interventions 
for HS and another systematic review on outcome measure instruments reviewed the

 validation evidence for existing instruments and mapped them according to potential 
domains.13,14
2: Qualitative studies: Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted at the 
Department of Dermatology, Zealand university hospital, Roskilde, Denmark and 
Department of Dermatology, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA. 
Purposive sampling of a wide diversity of age groups, sex, treatments received and disease 
severities was employed. Inclusion of patients ceased when saturation was achieved, defined 
as when no new knowledge was obtained from the subsequent interviews. Patients were 
identified primarily among those undergoing treatment at the two Departments of 
Dermatology. Eligibility was based on a confirmed diagnosis of HS and willingness to 
participate.
All interviews were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim and initially examined for units 
of meaning, coded as items and grouped into categories. Qualitative interviews do not 
require ethical approval in Denmark. In USA, the project was approved by the institutional 
review board of the Penn State College of Medicine.
The two lists of candidate items generated from the Danish and US qualitative studies were 
combined into one patient-generated item list.
3: Identification of items of importance to HCPs: To identify outcomes of importance to 
HCPs an item generation e-Delphi round zero was conducted among the HCP stakeholders. 
Participants were first provided with background information on the rationale for 
development of a HS COS. They were then asked to list all items that they considered 
important regarding HS, with items being related to any aspect of the disease, or treatment 
of the disease.
The steering group reviewed all items suggested by the HCPs and produced a preliminary 
list of candidate items by combining the results from the systematic reviews, the qualitative 
studies and the HCPs item generation survey.
Consensus process
A summary of the consensus process is in Figure 1. An international steering group (the first 
12 authors of this manuscript) consisting of researchers, clinicians and a patient research 
partner guided development of the COS.
Methods to reach consensus on the core domain set—An anonymous Delphi 
approach was applied to make sure that the views of all participants were obtained. The e-
Delphi survey was delivered using DelphiManager® (round one and two) and 
SurveyMonkey® (round three to five) software. A unique identifier code allowed 
identification of participants completing all rounds of the Delphi survey. Only participants 
who had completed the previous round of the survey were invited to participate in 
subsequent rounds. All surveys were pilot-tested by at least two members of the steering 
group, including the patient representative, and at least two additional panel members.

 Items/domain scoring—Participants were asked to score each item/domain using a 
modified scale from the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and 
Evaluations (GRADE) from one to nine. Explanation was provided that scores of one to 
three are ‘not important’, scores of four to six are ‘ important but not critical’ and scores of 
seven to nine are ‘critical’ to include.25 From round two of the Delphi onwards, participants 
were provided feedback in the form of their own scores in the previous round and the 
aggregate scores from the previous round, sub-divided into the patient and HCP groups.
Definition of consensus—Pre-specified consensus endpoints are outlined in Table I.
E-Delphi round one and two—Participants were provided with background information 
explaining how the candidate items were identified and were then asked to rate each of the 
items listed, based on their importance in being measured as an outcome in all clinical trials 
for HS. Participants were also asked to suggest items not represented in the list. Items 
suggested were reviewed by the steering group to ensure they represented new items and all 
items were carried forward to round two. In round two, the number of participants who 
ranked each item and the distribution of scores (as percentages of the total) by stakeholder 
group from round one were shown graphically in the survey and participants were asked to 
consider responses from other panel members and to re-score all items. All items were 
carried forward to consensus meeting I and II and e-Delphi round three.
HISTORIC consensus meeting I and II—After the first two e-Delphi rounds, 
participants were invited to take part in two in-person consensus meetings (Vienna, 
September, 2016 and New York, October, 2016). In these meetings, patients and HCPs 
collaborated on nominating items for exclusion based on round 2 e-Delphi results and 
grouping remaining candidate items into domains. The process of defining domains was 
achieved in small groups using nominal group theory. Prior to the nominal group exercise, 
participants were made aware that items could form their own stand-alone domain or be 
collected into an umbrella domain, if the items were sufficiently congruent and capable of 
being measured by a single instrument.
As only a sub-set of the e-Delphi group was able to attend the in-person meetings all 
decisions taken at the meetings required confirmation by the larger HISTORIC project group 
in a subsequent online confirmation survey before implementation. Prior to completion of 
the survey, e-Delphi panel members were provided with a summary of the in-person meeting 
discussions. A detailed description of consensus meeting I and II and the online 
confirmation survey has been published.26
E-Delphi round three—In round three, the items were shown under their newly 
designated domain, following the work from the in-person meetings. Items that were marked 
for exclusion at the consensus meetings were shown at the end, under a heading of ‘marked 
for exclusion’. Items that were marked for exclusion and did not reach ‘consensus in’ were 
not carried forward to round four.
HISTORIC consensus meeting III—After the third e-Delphi round, it was noted that 
some items and domains were considered ‘critical’ to include in the COS only by patients or 
Thorlacius et al.

 HCPs but not both. These discordant items were discussed by patients and HCPs at a third 
in-person consensus meeting (Copenhagen, February, 2017). This discussion was followed 
by non-binding voting.
E-Delphi round four and five—In round four, participants voted at the domain level for 
the first time and voted again on items within each domain that had still not reached clear 
‘consensus in’. A summary of the discussion and voting results from consensus meeting III 
were provided, as well as the results from e-Delphi round three. In round five, participants 
voted on two domains for which consensus was nearly achieved (more than 67 % combined 
critical votes) to determine whether these should be included in the COS.
HISTORIC consensus meeting IV—The results of e-Delphi rounds one to five and 
HISTORIC in-person consensus meetings I-III were presented at the annual IDEOM 
meeting in Washington, DC in May 2017. All meeting participants were asked if they 
considered the HISTORIC HS COS process to be methodologically robust and inclusive and 
if the project had developed an appropriate COS. Consensus for the final core domain set 
was defined as >70% of all participants voting yes to both these questions.
RESULTS
Participants
Patient characteristics from the qualitative studies are found in Table II and demographics of 
all Delphi participants are found in Table III. A total of 42 patients participated in the 
qualitative studies and a total of 93 (41 patients and 52 HCPs) from 19 countries in four 
continents participated in the first round of the e-Delphi. In the last round of the e-Delphi, 78 
participants continued to take part, a 16% attrition rate. Of the 15 drop outs, nine were 
patients and six were HCPs, while nine were from North America and six were from other 
continents..
Candidate outcome items and domains
A list of all 56 items initially included in the Delphi exercise is found in Table IV. The 
systematic review identified 16 potential candidate items, 33 additional items were identified 
by patients in the qualitative studies and the HCP item generation survey identified 7 further 
items (Table IV). One item suggested by a patient participant in the first e-Delphi round 
(number of chronic areas) was judged to represent a new outcome and added to the list of 
candidate items in round two and subsequent rounds. Item numbers 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 13, 16, 30, 
39, 41, 45, 47, 53 (Table IV) were nominated for exclusion following consensus meeting I 
and II,26 did not reach ‘consensus in’ in e-Delphi round 3 and were therefore excluded. One 
item, ‘Pain’ was ranked so highly by both patients and HCPs that it was nominated to form a 
domain in its own right. Other domains were formed by collecting together similar items 
during the nominal group exercises, as detailed in the report of consensus meetings I and II.

 The final core domain set
The final core domain set is illustrated in Figure 2. After the last e-Delphi and the final 
consensus meeting the participants agreed to include five domains in the HS COS for 
clinical trials: pain, physical signs, HS specific quality of life, global assessment and 
progression of course. The domains are further defined by the items that were fused in the 
process of creating domains (Fig. 2). A ‘symptoms’ domain, containing the items ‘drainage’ 
and ‘fatigue’, was strongly supported by patients but did not quite reach our a priori 
definition of ‘consensus in’ from the perspective of HCPs.
78.6 % of consensus meeting IV participants considered the HISTORIC COS process to be 
inclusive and methodologically robust and 82.3% felt that an appropriate COS had been 
achieved and voted to ratify the HISTORIC COS.
Protocol deviations
The HISTORIC consensus meeting III was not planned a priori but was added after round 
three to allow further discussion of some items and domains where disagreement between 
patients and HCPs was identified. E-Delphi round five was added after round four to discuss 
domains where consensus had nearly, but not quite, been achieved. This resulted in inclusion 
of the ‘progression of course’ domain in the final COS, but did not affect lack of consensus 
between HCPs and patients regarding the symptoms domain. As no items or domains ever 
reached the predefined ‘consensus out’ rule in any rounds, the process focused only on the 
predefined ‘consensus in’ rule. By comparing the proportions voting critical among HCPs 
and patients, when both proportions were above 70% threshold, these items/domains were 
considered part of the COS.
DISCUSSION
We used a rigorous, iterative and inclusive approach to identify consensus among an 
international group of HS patients and HCPs, producing five core domains relevant for all 
types of clinical trials for HS, namely pain, physical signs, HS specific quality of life, global 
assessment and progression of course. There was close agreement among all stakeholders to 
include the final five domains in the COS. Based on our protocol, the symptoms domain is 
not included as a core domain because it only reached ‘consensus in’ from the patient 
perspective and support was insufficient from HCPs. However, the HISTORIC Steering 
group reflected that, because symptoms is a patient reported domain and was considered 
critical by our patient participants, the patient view supersedes that of HCPs in this instance. 
As a result, the HISTORIC Steering group agreed that the symptoms domain should be 
included in step two of the COS process to search for a suitable instrument for the domain.
Limitations to the present study include that our aim to involve a 1:1 ratio of patients: HCPs 
was not completely reached and that we did not succeed in involving participants from the 
continents of Africa and South America in the project.
The HISTORIC initiative has begun the process to develop a COS for HS trials. The 
implementation of a COS for HS clinical trials should improve the interpretation and 
comparison of future studies testing interventions for HS and reduce the risk of outcome

 reporting bias and heterogeneity across studies. After achieving consensus on what to 
measure in HS clinical trials, the next step for the HISTORIC initiative will be to reach 
consensus on the outcome measurement instruments best suited to measure each of the core 
domains in the COS.
In conclusion, our present study reports on the robust development of a comprehensive COS 
for use in all trials assessing interventions for HS. The final COS includes five core outcome 
domains agreed by both patients and HCPs and a sixth domain, symptoms, is recommended 
by the HISTORIC Steering Group because it is a patient reported domain that received 
strong support from our patient stakeholder group. The routine adoption of this COS in 
future HS trials should ensure that outcome domains of importance to both patients and 
HCPs are included and reported.

 What’s already known about this topic?
•
Outcome measure instruments used for hidradenitis suppurativa are markedly 
heterogeneous with 30 instruments recently found in 12 randomized trials.
•
Lack of consensus regarding outcome measure instruments limits evidence 
synthesis and increases the risk of outcome reporting bias.
•
A core domain set is an agreed minimum set of what to measure that should 
be reported in all clinical trials of a specific condition.
What does this study add?
•
Our study provides global multi-stakeholder consensus on core outcome 
domains for hidradenitis suppurativa.
•
The final core domain set includes five domains: pain, physical signs, 
hidradenitis suppurativa-specific quality of life, global assessment and 
progression of course.
•
A sixth domain, symptoms, was highly supported by patients and not by 
healthcare professionals; it is recommended by the HISTORIC Steering 
Committee as an additional core domain, in the context of being a patient-
reported domain.
