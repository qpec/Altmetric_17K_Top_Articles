Cannabis use has been reported to induce long-lasting psy-
chotic disorders and a dose-response relationship has been 
observed. We performed a systematic review of studies that 
investigate the association between the degree of cannabis 
consumption and psychosis and a meta-analysis to quan-
tify the magnitude of effect. Published studies were identi-
fied through search of electronic databases, supplemented 
by manual searches of bibliographies. Studies were consid-
ered if they provided data on cannabis consumption prior 
to the onset of psychosis using a dose criterion (frequency/
amount used) and reported psychosis-related outcomes. We 
performed random effects meta-analysis of individual data 
points generated with a simulation method from the sum-
mary data of the original studies. From 571 references, 18 
studies fulfilled inclusion criteria for the systematic review 
and 10 were inserted in the meta-analysis, enrolling a total of 
66 816 individuals. Higher levels of cannabis use were asso-
ciated with increased risk for psychosis in all the included 
studies. A logistic regression model gave an OR of 3.90 
(95% CI 2.84 to 5.34) for the risk of schizophrenia and 
other psychosis-related outcomes among the heaviest canna-
bis users compared to the nonusers. Current evidence shows 
that high levels of cannabis use increase the risk of psychotic 
outcomes and confirms a dose-response relationship between 
the level of use and the risk for psychosis. Although a causal 
link cannot be unequivocally established, there is sufficient 
evidence to justify harm reduction prevention programs.

Introduction
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) 
reports that 3.9% of the global adult population uses can-
nabis, with a total number of 180.6 million of cannabis 
users worldwide.1 This outweighs the number of users of 
all other illicit substances considered together. In some 
countries, cannabis is categorized as a drug of abuse and 
its use is strictly prohibited, while in others it is perceived 
as a benign, relatively harmless substance.2–6 However, 
cannabis use has been widely reported to induce acute 
psychotic experiences,7–9 to affect the severity of psychotic 
symptoms,10,11 and previous meta-analyses have reported 
a 2-fold increase in the risk to develop a psychotic disor-
der in cannabis users compared to nonusers.12–14
In order to establish which users are most likely to 
suffer negative effects, studies have focused on different 
characteristics of the users or the pattern of use that 
might determine those most at risk. A dose-response 
relationship between cannabis use and psychosis related 
outcomes, in terms of duration of use and/or frequency 
of use, has been reported.15–20 However, the extent of this 
relationship remains uncertain.
We therefore performed a systematic review of the lit-
erature investigating the association between the extent of 
cannabis consumption and psychosis-related outcomes 
and proceeded with a meta-analysis to quantify the mag-
nitude of effect. Unlike previous meta-analyses that used 
only the comparison between the extreme categories (no 
users vs heavy users) to produce a pooled estimate of the 
effect, we express the increased risk of psychosis rela-
tive to a continuous variable of the level of exposure to 
cannabis.

Meta-analysis of Cannabis and Psychosis
electronic databases Pubmed, Embase, and PsychINFO. 
Terms related to a dose-response relationship, ie, “dose-
response,” “daily use,” “duration,” “high frequency” or 
“heavy use” were combined with the terms “psychosis,” 
“schizophrenia” or “schizphreni*” and with “cannab*,” 
“cannabis”, “marijuana” or “marihuana”.
The search was limited to studies published from the 
inception of databases to December 31, 2013. This search 
yielded 571 articles that were screened for inclusion on 
the basis of their titles, abstracts or the whole text, if 
necessary. Reference lists from all included studies, and 
from the main published reviews of cannabis and psycho-
sis12–14,22,23 were examined and experts were contacted to 
obtain additional reports.
Selection Criteria and Data Extraction
Only peer-reviewed articles were considered and no lan-
guage limitations were applied in the attempt to locate 
all the relevant papers. Studies were identified by one of 
the authors (A.M.) and independently checked for inclu-
sion by another (E.V
.). Both cohort and cross-sectional 
studies were included in the systematic review when they 
met the following criteria: (1) assessment of cannabis use 
with a dose criterion (frequency/amount used/severity) 
before the onset of psychosis, and (2) psychosis-related 
outcomes established with validated clinical measures. 
Reasons for exclusion at this stage were: (1) enrolment 
of subjects known as suffering from mental illness before 
the use of cannabis or ultra-high risk subjects, (2) studies 
examining the comorbidity between substance use disor-
ders and psychosis, (3) neuropsychological measures or 
schizoid personality traits rather than psychosis as main 
outcome, (4) data available on cannabis consumption not 
classified according to at least 3 different levels of use 
(ie, nonusers plus 2 or more other levels), and (5) stud-
ies investigating only the effect of cannabis use on age at 
onset of psychosis.
When the outcome was “age at onset,” papers were 
screened to check if suitable information about the 
degree of cannabis consumption at a fixed temporal 
threshold were available for both cases and controls (ie, 
past cannabis consumption and degree of consumption 
at a fixed year of life). The same procedure of screen-
ing of the whole text was performed whenever the title 
or the abstract of a study did not rule out the possibility 
of gathering suitable data on the association between the 
exposure and the aimed outcome. When studies reported 
various psychosis outcomes, we took the most severe 
(higher threshold in continuous scale of psychosis or 
maximum number of psychotic symptoms).
Two independent authors (A.M. and E.V
.) extracted 
the following data from each eligible study: (1) the year 
and country in which the study had been conducted, 
(2) study design, (3) exposure measures, (4) psychosis 
related outcome, (5) total sample size divided in cases 
and controls by level of exposure, and (6) relative risks or 
odds ratios as presented in the studies.
Statistical Analysis
In each study we recorded the number of comparison 
groups defined by different levels of cannabis use, their 
sample size (number of cases and controls in each group) 
and the OR compared to the group of individuals who 
have never used cannabis; the latter was consistently used 
as the reference category. As some studies reported only 
adjusted OR using different covariates, we estimated 
crude OR from the number of cases and controls in each 
group by dividing the case/control ratio at each level of 
exposure to cannabis by the case/control ratio at the base-
line group of no use.
Despite the different definitions of severity used in 
each study (frequency of use in lifetime or in specific 
periods of time, duration of use etc.), cannabis expo-
sure was always presented as an ordered variable. As the 
underlying distribution of cannabis use for each study is 
unknown, to create an index of cannabis exposure, we 
employed an approach based on ranking the individu-
als by their cannabis use. Those in the sample who have 
never used cannabis were assigned a cannabis index of 0, 
while the ones who have been exposed to the risk factor 
can be assigned a cannabis index between 0 and 1 along 
a uniformly distributed scale, U(0,1). For each study, this 
scale was divided in bins equal to the number of cannabis 
exposure groups. The width of each bin was determined 
from the relevant ratio of the total number of individuals 
in each group, with the exception of the reference group 
(no exposure) which was set to 0. Summary data from 
the studies included in the meta-analysis is presented in 
table 1.
To estimate the association between cannabis exposure 
and psychosis and to derive confidence intervals in each 
study, we used a simulation method we have previously 
developed.24 In brief, we simulate individual-level data 
from the summary statistics (number of cases and con-
trols in each exposure level) based on the ranks of the 
uniform distribution and then fit a logistic regression 
model. The logarithm of the odds of psychosis related 
outcome as a function of the level of cannabis exposure is 
given by ln(p/1 − p) = a + bx, where p is the probability of 
developing the outcome, x the cannabis index between 0 
and 1, a the intercept and b the regression coefficient. The 
exponential of b represents the OR of psychosis between 
the heaviest cannabis user (x = 1) and the nonuser (x = 0). 
The probability of psychosis for an individual with can-
nabis index value x is then given by p = ea+bx/(1 + ea+bx).
At the first iteration, each subject was randomly 
assigned to be case or control using a Bernoulli variable, 
with the probability of psychosis P(case) = nca/(nca + 
nco), where nca and nco are the numbers of cases and con-
trols in each bin. Subsequent iterations were performed

Meta-analysis of Cannabis and Psychosis
using parameter estimates from the previous iteration to 
produce a distribution of exposure and case status within 
each cannabis exposure bin that approximated the under-
lying distribution. We retained the regression coefficient 
b with its SE and after 1000 iterations we calculated their 
mean values. The method is illustrated with an example 
in supplementary figure and full details are presented in 
Vassos et al.24
Under the assumption of an equivalent distribution of 
cannabis use across studies, we performed meta-analysis 
to produce a single estimate of the effect size of canna-
bis as a risk factor of psychosis, weighting studies by the 
SE of b. Heterogeneity between samples was assessed 
using Cochran’s Q and I2 statistics25 and, given the high 
heterogeneity observed (I2 > 50%), estimates were com-
bined with the Der-Simonian and Laird random-effects 
model.26 Data were analyzed using Stata release 10 (Stata 
Corp. 2007), and R v2.15 (www.r-project.org).
As studies used different designs and outcome mea-
sures, we performed the following subgroup analyses: 
(1) separate analysis of studies with cohort and cross-
sectional design and (2) stratification by outcome mea-
sure (diagnosis of a psychotic disorder or presence of 
psychotic symptoms). A meta-regression with the year of 
the study as covariate was performed to assess the het-
erogeneity of the findings. Publication bias was examined 
with Egger’s and Begg’s tests for small study effects.27,28
Results
The systematic review search yielded 571 references. On 
the basis of their title, abstract or full text, as necessary, 
557 articles were excluded as described in the flow chart 
(figure 1). Four additional articles cited in the selected 
papers were considered relevant and included in the 
systematic review as they fulfilled the inclusion crite-
ria.15,20,29,30 As for the Swedish 1969 conscript cohort, 3 
reports15,20,29 met our inclusion criteria, we selected one,15 
based on the number of exposure groups. One study 
showing very high effect size based on 10 cases only30 was 
excluded from the meta-analysis. The London study16,31 
was supplemented with all the available data from the 
Genetics and Psychosis (GAP) cohort.
Diagnostic outcomes of selected studies included a 
diagnosis or first admission for schizophrenia,15 a diagno-
sis of schizophreniform disorder,32 a first contact with the 
clinical services for a first episode of Psychosis16 or the 
presence of psychotic symptoms over a certain threshold 
set in each study7,13,18,19,33–35 (table 1). Studies with continu-
ous outcome measures were excluded because they report 
a range of heterogeneous outcomes and therefore it was 
inappropriate to pool them.17,36 Ten studies were finally 
included in the meta-analysis, enrolling a total of 66 816 
individuals.
We observed a consistent increase in the risk of psy-
chosis-related outcomes with higher levels of cannabis 
exposure in all the included studies (figure 2). We used 
a random effect model for the meta-analysis, due to the 
high heterogeneity of the studies (I2 = 82%). The pooled 
estimate for the logistic regression coefficient b was 1.36 
(95% CI: 1.04 to 1.68), corresponding to an OR of 3.90 
(2.84 to 5.34) for the risk of schizophrenia and other psy-
chosis outcomes among the most severe cannabis users 
compared to the nonusers. The linear expression of the 
risk allows the estimation of OR at different levels of 
exposure using the formula OR = exp(b*x), where x the 
rank in a scale of 0 to 1 of the median individual in the 
group of interest. For example, the median OR for any 
cannabis use is 1.97 (1.68 to 2.31) while for the top 20% 
group it is 3.40 (2.55 to 4.54). These estimates are com-
parable to previous studies that report OR for any use or 
severe cannabis use.
Subgroup analyses by method or outcome measure 
gave remarkably similar results for each category. When 
data were stratified by study design, the pooled OR for 
cross-sectional studies was 3.99 (2.50 to 6.37) and for 
cohort studies 3.83 (2.34 to 6.29); when stratified by out-
come measure, the pooled OR for presence of psychotic 
symptoms was 3.59 (2.42 to 5.32) and for a diagnosis of 
schizophrenia or psychotic disorder was 5.07 (3.62 to 
7.09; figure 3).
Meta-regression by year of study was nonsignifi-
cant (P = .53), indicating that heterogeneity cannot be 
explained by the date of the study. Finally the size of the 
study and the SE did not correlate with the effect size 
as indicated by the nonsignificant publication bias tests 
(Egger’s P = .79, Begg’s P = .86).
Discussion
In this meta-analysis of all available published data, we 
confirm a positive association between the extent of can-
nabis use and the risk for psychosis. This association was 
consistent in all the individual studies included, despite 
differences in the effect size. The pooled analysis reported 
approximately a 4-fold increase in risk for the heaviest 
users and a 2-fold increase for the average cannabis user 
in comparison to nonusers. This observation remained 
stable irrespective of the study design (cohort or cross-
sectional) or the outcome measure (broad definition of 
psychosis or narrow diagnosis of a psychotic disorder). 
Since, for the cohort studies, we excluded studies enroll-
ing subjects already suffering from symptoms at baseline, 
these results are not likely to be explained by a reverse-
causation mechanism.
Two types of studies investigating the association 
between cannabis and psychosis were identified. Those 
included in this meta-analysis examined the association 
between the level of cannabis use and categorical outcome 
measures (presence or absence of psychosis, individuals 
with psychotic symptoms exceeding a severity thresh-
old). The second type consists of studies with continuous

outcomes (eg, scores at different tests measuring psycho-
sis). These also indicated an increase in psychotic symp-
tomatology by the increase in the level of cannabis use, 
but were not pooled together as they were very heteroge-
neous and did not fulfil our inclusion criteria.
Considering well-established examples of the effects of 
drugs of abuse on health, it is well known that the health 
hazards depend on the pattern of use. Nobody would dis-
pute that drinking a glass of wine everyday is less likely to 
be associated with serious health consequences than drink-
ing a bottle of vodka daily. However, while the biology 
underlying alcohol use toxicity has been well described, 
the mechanism underlying cannabis associated psychosis 
is still largely unknown. Although extensive literature on

Meta-analysis of Cannabis and Psychosis
the effects of alcohol on health and legislation on drink-
driving have suggested safe doses and legal limits, there is 
not enough evidence to suggest a “safe dose” of canna-
bis. Our estimates are based on the assumption of a linear 
increase of risk with the increase of cannabis use.
Strengths of this study include the use of all available 
published data (based on 66 816 individuals), the estima-
tion of the pooled effect size utilizing all levels of expo-
sure, not just comparing any cannabis use with no use or 
limiting the comparison to the extremes (most severe use 
vs no use), and the expression of risk for psychosis in a 
linear form, allowing the estimation of relative risk of 
psychosis in individuals at different levels of exposure.
However, there are some important limitations to this 
report. First, in order to utilize all available evidence, we 
employed an inclusive definition of our outcome mea-
sures, examining both “soft” outcomes such as psychotic 
experiences and “hard” outcomes such as diagnosis or 
admission with a psychotic disorder and we did not have 
data on the time interval between regular cannabis use 
to illness onset. Although one would predict a greater 
effect of cannabis on psychotic experiences if in the origi-
nal studies, the long term outcome of cannabis use was 
“contaminated” with reality distortion due to intoxica-
tion, we did not find significant difference in the sensi-
tivity analysis by outcome measure; indeed, our “hard” 
outcomes showed a stronger association with the degree 
of cannabis use. This observation indicates that the risk 
of cannabis use is not confined to short-term effects and 
supports previous evidence of a continuum between 
psychotic experiences and schizophrenia.37 Second, we 
included dissimilar study designs ranging from general 
population cohorts to cross-sectional studies of cases 
and controls with retrospective measurement of cannabis 
use. Thus, heterogeneity was expected in both the sample 
characteristics and the outcomes measured. However, 
our sensitivity analyses, separating prospective from ret-
rospective studies, gave remarkably similar estimates of 
the effect size.
Another limitation is that we could only measure 
the degree of exposure without taking into account the 
potency of cannabis or the period of use. There is previous 
evidence that use of high-potency cannabis as well as early 
onset of use16 are stronger risk factors for psychosis. More 
research is needed in these areas to draw safe conclusions. 
In addition, we pooled studies with different exposure 
measures, including frequency or duration of cannabis use 
and clinical diagnosis of use, abuse, or dependence. The 
rationale was that cannabis exposure was always presented 
as an ordered variable and in all studies we observed an 
increase in the risk of psychosis with increased exposure, 
irrespective of the method used. It is noteworthy that our 
estimates are based on raw (unadjusted) data; hence, the 
effect may partially be explained by confounders like dif-
ferences in ethnicity or socioeconomic status between can-
nabis users and nonusers. However, studies that controlled 
for these effects16,19 confirmed the association.
In comparison to a previous meta-analysis by Moore 
and colleagues12 that estimated an odds ratio of 1.4 for 
any cannabis use and 2.1 for severe use, our estimates 
may appear high. However, we have included more recent 
evidence, data from all levels of exposure, unadjusted 
OR, and our estimates correspond to the risk of the 
most severe user, not the average user in the top category. 
Estimating the risk of the average individual in the severe 
use category with the linear model (eg, 3.4 for the top 
20%) and reducing our estimate by an average attenuation 
value for fully adjusted estimates of 45%, as Moore et al12 
report, would give comparable results. Our estimates are 
remarkably similar to a recent national epidemiologic

survey that reported an adjusted for sociodemographic 
characteristics OR of 3.69 (2.49 to 5.47) for a diagnosis 
of psychosis among individuals with lifetime history of 
cannabis dependence.38
Although this meta-analysis shows a strong and con-
sistent association between cannabis use and psychosis, a 
causal link cannot be unequivocally established. However, 
investigating modifiable factors with a substantial role 
in psychosis is useful for prevention programmes as the 
level of exposure to cannabis remains a very important 
risk marker for schizophrenia and psychosis in general. 
Irrespective of whether the joint effect of risk factors is 
better described by multiplicative39 or synergistic models40 
as previously suggested, at an individual level it would 
seem justified to educate people at heightened risk of 
schizophrenia (eg, through having a family history of the 
disorder, or having experienced psychosis-like symptoms) 
of the potential additional risk of cannabis exposure.
In conclusion, our meta-analysis provides the most accu-
rate estimate of the effect size of cannabis use as a risk fac-
tor for psychosis using all the available published data. In 
addition, it measures a dose-response relationship between 
the level of use and the risk for psychosis. Thus, for pub-
lic policy, apart from prevention programmes targeting 
cannabis use in general, harm minimization approaches 
aiming at dose reduction or later onset of use are also rel-
evant in the prevention and treatment of psychosis. For 
the scientific community, further research is needed to bet-
ter understand the biological pathways that link cannabis 
use with psychosis and to establish particular patterns of 
cannabis use that carry the highest hazard for psychosis-
related outcomes, especially in vulnerable subjects.
