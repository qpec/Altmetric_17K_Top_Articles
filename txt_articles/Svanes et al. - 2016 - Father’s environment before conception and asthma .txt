Abstract
Background: Whereas it is generally accepted that maternal environment plays a key
role in child health, emerging evidence suggests that paternal environment before con-
ception also impacts child health. We aimed to investigate the association between chil-
dren’s asthma risk and parental smoking and welding exposures prior to conception.
Methods: In a longitudinal, multi-country study, parents of 24 168 offspring aged 2–51
years provided information on their life-course smoking habits, occupational exposure
to welding and metal fumes, and offspring’s asthma before/after age 10 years and
hay fever. Logistic regressions investigated the relevant associations controlled for
age, study centre, parental characteristics (age, asthma, education) and clustering by
family.
Results: Non-allergic early-onset asthma (asthma without hay fever, present in 5.8%)
was more common in the offspring with fathers who smoked before conception {odds
ratio [OR] ¼ 1.68 [95% confidence interval (CI) ¼ 1.18–2.41]}, whereas mothers’ smoking
before conception did not predict offspring asthma. The risk was highest if father started
smoking before age 15 years [3.24 (1.67–6.27)], even if he stopped more than 5 years be-
fore conception [2.68 (1.17–6.13)]. Fathers’ pre-conception welding was independently
associated with non-allergic asthma in his offspring [1.80 (1.29–2.50)]. There was no ef-
fect if the father started welding or smoking after birth. The associations were consistent
across countries.
Conclusions: Environmental exposures in young men appear to influence the respiratory
health of their offspring born many years later. Influences during susceptible stages of
spermatocyte development might be important and needs further investigation in
humans. We hypothesize that protecting young men from harmful exposures may lead
to improved respiratory health in future generations.
Key words: asthma, epidemiology, smoking, occupational exposure, epigenesis
Introduction
It is well known that a mother’s environment plays a key
role in child health. The hypothesis that health and disease
originate early in life has dramatically increased our under-
standing of this issue and is guiding public health policy.
However, emerging evidence suggests that there are mech-
anisms whereby the father’s environment before concep-
tion could also impact the health of future generations.1
Environmental factors such as smoking and occupa-
tional exposures can cause genetic and epigenetic changes
in sperm that are transmissible to offspring.2–9 There is evi-
dence for inheritable effects of food restriction through the
male line from human studies, suggesting particular effects
on offspring when exposure occurs during prepuberty.10–13
The recent development of hypotheses regarding ‘windows
of susceptibility’ to environmental insults during sperm
Key Messages
• Smoking and occupational welding in young men appeared to independently increase asthma risk in their offspring
born many years later.
• Early puberty might possibly be a critical vulnerable period.
• The findings provide an unexpectedly strong argument for focusing on the adverse environmental exposures of ado-
lescent males.

 development suggests an urgent need to investigate expos-
ures occurring in adolescent men with potential impacts
for their offspring.2 Such investigation requires large, long-
term, epidemiologic studies of multiple generations.
One outcome in which paternal exposures might play
an important role is childhood asthma. Despite major sci-
entific efforts and mounting evidence that asthma aeti-
ology starts as early as the intra-uterine period, knowledge
of the causal factors remains incomplete. There is some
evidence that paternal in utero exposure to cigarette smoke
is associated with his children’s asthma14 but, to our
knowledge, there are no studies of asthma investigating
fathers’ exposures beyond this, including exposures prior
to starting a family. Existing knowledge of inheritable
spermatogenic effects make this an appealing target for
investigating windows of susceptibility in fathers. In add-
ition, occupational environmental exposures in young men
prior to reproduction need to be investigated, as the work-
place provides an important source of potentially harmful
exposures.2
The Respiratory Health In Northern Europe (RHINE)
study provides a unique data set including detailed infor-
mation on smoking habits and occupational exposure to
welding and metal fumes from large population-based co-
horts in multiple centres and countries, followed over a 20-
year period. RHINE thus provides a rare opportunity for
detailed investigation of parental environmental exposures
and potential impact on asthma risk in their children. The
most recent follow-up included information on asthma
prevalence in participants’ offspring (27 120). Welding is a
relevant occupational exposure implicated in a variety of
respiratory health problems. It has also been shown to
have effects on sperm quality.15–17
In this study, we first aimed to investigate whether par-
ental exposure to smoking and welding, including expos-
ure
prior
to
conception,
influenced
asthma
risk
in
offspring, with a particular focus on exposures in fathers.
Second, we aimed to identify susceptible windows during
male reproductive development by addressing whether po-
tential pre-conception effects were related to exposure age,
exposure duration and time from quitting exposure until
conception.
Methods
Study population
RHINE III is the second follow-up of a population-based
cohort
from
seven
northern
European
centres
(Supplementary Figure 1, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online). Random population samples of men and
women born in 1945–73 completed postal questionnaires
in 1991–93, 1999–2001 and 2010–12. In 2010–12, partici-
pants were asked about their children, including each
child’s birth year, asthma and allergies.18 The parent study
(ECRHS) recruited random samples from population-
based registers in each country. The intention of this sam-
pling was to recruit a population-based sample but not
‘families’ or ‘married/cohabiting couples’. Therefore, we
have information on women who became mothers and
men who became fathers—but not ‘couples who became
parents. Thus, pre-conception information was available
only for one of the offspring’s parents, the one that did par-
ticipate in the parent study’; 1880 reported having no chil-
dren and the remaining participants reported a total of
27 120 children aged 0–51 years (mean age 22 years), with
mean family size 1.9 siblings.
The studies were approved by medical research ethics
regional committees according to national legislations. All
participants gave written informed consent.
Parental smoking
RHINE participants provided information about smoking
habits, including year of smoking debut and quitting.
Parental smoking exposure was defined in three groups by
relating this information to birth year for each offspring:
(i) ‘Smoking
only prior to
conception’: parent
quit
smoking �2 years prior to child’s birth year; (ii) ‘Smoking
including period around birth’: parent smoked in the
period around child’s birth; most smoked before, during
and after pregnancy; (iii) ‘Smoking started after birth’.
Fathers’ age of starting smoking was categorized as before
or after 15 years, the mean age of completed puberty
(mean age of voice break 14.5 years, first nocturnal emis-
sion 14.8 years).19
Parental welding
In the first follow-up (1999–2001), prior to collecting in-
formation about offspring (2010–11), parents were asked
about occupational exposure to welding or metal fumes
(‘Have you worked with welding or in any other way in
your work been exposed to metal fumes/welding fumes?’).
Those answering ‘yes’ were asked about years of starting
and quitting. Median age for starting welding was 19 years
(interquartile range 17–22) among those who started weld-
ing before conception.
Asthma phenotypes in offspring
Asthma was defined based on the following question:
‘Please write the years when your children were born, and
tick “YES” if they have had any of the following: Asthma

 before 10 year; Asthma after 10 years; Hayfever/rhinitis;
Atopic eczema/skin allergies’. Asthma before 10 years
defined ‘early-onset asthma’ and asthma after age 10 years
defined ‘later-onset asthma’. ‘Allergic asthma’ was defined
by a positive answer to asthma and to hay fever; ‘non-aller-
gic asthma’ as having asthma but not hay fever. Age 10
years was set as the cut-off point to separate childhood
asthma from asthma with onset in early puberty or later in
both sexes.
Infants under 2 years of age were excluded from ana-
lyses, as asthma diagnosis in this age group is unclear
(n ¼ 175 excluded, two with parent-reported asthma).
Statistical analysis
Associations of parental smoking patterns and occupa-
tional welding with asthma phenotypes in offspring were
analysed using logistic regressions adjusting for age, study
centre and parental characteristics (age, parent asthma be-
fore age 10, education level) and clustering by family using
multilevel modelling. Analyses of welding included adjust-
ment for smoking. Grandparent education, number of sib-
lings and type of dwelling were considered as potential
confounders in all analyses, but were not included in the
final models, as they did not alter the effect estimates
by �5%.
Analyses were structured as follows:
i. We examined the association between maternal and
paternal smoking during different periods (smoked
only prior to conception; smoked including period
around birth; smoked only after child’s birth) and
asthma
phenotypes
(early-onset
and
later-onset
asthma, further characterized as allergic and non-
allergic asthma).
ii. For the time periods and phenotypes where there was
evidence of an association between smoking and
asthma, we next tested for dose–response effects by
examining age of smoking debut, smoking duration,
amount and years before birth that smoking stopped.
iii. Finally, we investigated whether the association be-
tween paternal smoking and asthma in offspring dif-
fered according to paternal grandmothers’ smoking
status (a marker of fathers’ in utero smoking expos-
ure). For this analysis, we created five mutually exclu-
sive groups of paternal smoking: never smoked;
smoking debut before age 15; smoking debut after age
15 and duration less than 10 years before conception;
smoking debut after age 15 and duration more than 10
years
before
conception;
smoking
debut
after
conception.
The relationship between paternal welding (including
age started and duration) with offspring asthma was ana-
lysed using similar definitions as for smoking (welding be-
fore or after age 15 and for less or more than 10 years).
Only 40 fathers started welding before age 15; early-onset
welding was thus not analysed. Welding in mothers was
uncommon and not analysed.
Meta-analysis was conducted using both fixed effects
and random effects models.20 Given that there was almost
no heterogeneity and both models gave identical results,
we
have
presented
the
fixed
effect
models
in
the
manuscript.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to consider the ef-
fect of missing data and differential recall based on child’s
reported asthma status (see Supplementary data, available
at IJE online).
Stata Statistical Software was used to analyse the data
(StataCorp. 2013, Stata Statistical Software: Release 13,
College Station, TX, StataCorp LP).
Results
Characteristics of the cohort
Of 26945 offspring over 2 years old, asthma status was re-
ported for 24168 (90%); these were included in the analyses
(Supplementary Table 1, available as Supplementary data at
IJE online). Early- and later-onset asthma were present in 8.
5% (allergic 2.6%; non-allergic 5.8%) and 4.2%, respect-
ively (Supplementary Table 1, available as Supplementary
data at IJE online). Supplementary Table 2a (available as
Supplementary data at IJE online) describes characteristics
and outcomes by parental smoking history (never smoked
48%, smoked only prior to conception 10%, other smoking
patterns 40%, smoked only after birth of child 1.6%).
Supplementary Table 2b (available as Supplementary data at
IJE online) describes characteristics and outcomes by paternal
welding (never welded 79%, welded prior to conception
18%, welded only after birth of child 4%).
Relationship between paternal smoking and
offspring asthma phenotypes
Individuals with a father who smoked only prior to con-
ception had more early-onset asthma than those whose
father never smoked (Table 1). This was due to an associ-
ation with non-allergic early-onset asthma. There was no
association with late-onset asthma (Table 1), including
when late-onset asthma was further divided into allergic or
non-allergic asthma (data not shown). Maternal smoking
around pregnancy and birth was associated with increased
early-onset asthma in offspring, most pronounced for the

 non-allergic phenotype (Table 1). Paternal or maternal
smoking only after the child’s birth was not associated
with offspring asthma.
Dose–response effect of paternal pre-conception
smoking and non-allergic early-onset asthma in
offspring
Both a father’s early smoking debut and a father’s longer
smoking duration before conception increased non-allergic
early-onset asthma in offspring, even with mutual adjustment
and adjusting for number of cigarettes and years since quit-
ting smoking (Table 2). Early smoking debut was associated
with more non-allergic early-onset offspring asthma even if
the smoking stopped at least 5 years before the child’s birth
[odds ratio (OR)¼ 2.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17–
6.13]. A father’s smoking debut before age 11 years (102
fathers) showed the greatest increased risk (OR¼ 3.95, 95%
CI¼ 1.07–14.60), followed by smoking debut ages 11–14
(OR¼ 1.75, 95% CI 1.07–1.86) and smoking debut after age
15 (OR¼ 1.37, 95% CI 1.00–1.86). Longer duration of
smoking was also associated with an increased risk, up to
1.8-fold for those smoking for more than 10 years (OR 1.76,
95% CI 0.96–3.25). Time of quitting before conception was
not independently associated with non-allergic early-onset
offspring asthma.
Relationship between paternal exposure to
tobacco smoke in utero (grandmaternal smoking)
and offspring non-allergic early-onset asthma
Grandmaternal smoking status was associated with risk of
non-allergic early-onset asthma in offspring (OR 1.3, 95% CI
1.0–1.6) and also modified the association between the
father’s own smoking status and asthma in his offspring. If
the paternal grandmother did not smoke, the father’s own
smoking before age 15 was associated with more non-allergic
early-onset asthma in his children (Table 3), but this associ-
ation was not present if the paternal grandmother smoked
(Pinteraction¼ 0.02). In contrast, long smoking duration was
associated with increased offspring asthma irrespective of
whether or not the paternal grandmother smoked.
Relationship between paternal occupational
exposure to welding prior to conception and non-
allergic early-onset asthma in offspring
Paternal welding starting prior to conception, but not
welding starting after conception, was associated with

 increased non-allergic early-onset asthma in offspring
(Table 4). Welding increased offspring asthma risk even if
the welding stopped prior to conception [adjusted odds
ratio (aOR) 1.56, 95% CI 0.99–2.46]. Welding duration
of at least 10 years was associated with a greater increase
in asthma (aOR 2.10, 95% CI 1.36–3.22) than welding for
less than 10 years (aOR 1.56, 95% CI 0.98–2.48).
Smoking and welding independently increased offspring
asthma risk and mutual adjustment did not alter the esti-
mates of either. Offspring had more asthma if fathers were
exposed to both smoking and welding (OR 3.6, 95% CI
1.7–7.6 for both smoking and welding for at least 10 years)
(Supplementary Table 3, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online). Welding duration for at least 10 years was

conception smoking or welding prior to conception

Discussion
Smoking and occupational welding in young men were
associated with asthma risk in their children, even if these
exposures occurred many years prior to conception. We
identified several potential susceptibility windows for pa-
ternal environmental exposures, with the highest risk
related to fathers’ smoking before completing puberty.
Figure 2 shows our findings in the context of existing
knowledge from laboratory and animal studies regarding
vulnerability windows in sperm development.2 For smok-
ing and welding starting after puberty, exposure duration
appeared to be the most important determinant. These
findings were consistent across geographical regions with
different smoking habits and occupational exposures, and
with different offspring asthma prevalence. These novel re-
sults suggest that environmental exposures in young men
can have important impact on their future offspring’s re-
spiratory health, and interventions aimed at adolescent
men might have large public health consequences.
To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating a
father’s environment prior to starting a family and the re-
sulting asthma risk in his children. Our findings confirm an
effect of fathers’ in utero exposure (grandmothers’ smok-
ing).14,21 Consistently with Miller and colleagues,14 we
find that paternal exposure to his own mother’s smoking
increased his children’s asthma risk. However, we also
found effects of a father’s own pre-conception smoking.
Concerning a mother’s smoking, we found more off-
spring asthma if the mother smoked around pregnancy,
consistently with previous studies.22,23 However, no effect
of maternal smoking prior to conception was identified.
This has not previously been investigated, to our know-
ledge. Male and female germ cells develop differently.
Further, if there is a prepuberty susceptibility window in
females, this would be at a younger age than in boys, and
at an age when the girls have not yet started smoking. This
could explain why we find an effect of pre-conception
smoking in men but not in women.
Several lines of evidence suggest that the observed ef-
fects could be mediated through influences on spermatozoa
development. The fathers’ but not the mothers’ pre-
conception exposure was associated with offspring risk,
suggesting effects through male germ cells. Smoking is
known to cause genetic and epigenetic damage to sperma-
tozoa, which are transmissible to offspring and have the po-
tential to induce developmental abnormalities.4,5,7,9,24–29
In utero smoking exposure of fathers could influence prim-
ordial germ cell development.3 A prepubertal vulnerability
window could be related to de novo DNA methylation
occurring during primordial germ cell differentiation to
spermatogonia.30 Such a window is indicated by the
Table 2. Patterns of paternal smoking prior to conception in
relation to early-onset non-allergic asthma in their children

inducing
specific
maintenance mechanisms. Alternatively, there could be a
threshold for damage of a certain exposure to this cell stage
that is already reached by in utero exposure. After puberty,
DNA methylation patterns are kept up through cycles of
spermatogenesis. This could constitute another vulnerabil-
ity window, requiring long exposure duration; our findings
agree with findings of higher inheritable mutation fre-
quency in murine spermatogonial stems cells with a longer
duration of smoking exposure.7,31 We found little benefit
from quitting smoking prior to conception, in agreement
with findings of impaired DNA repair mechanisms in
smoking exposed spermatozoa.32
Smoking causes hormonal disruption, affecting hormo-
nal and metabolic profiles. We found that men with early
smoking debut were shorter and heavier than never-
smokers and men with later smoking debut. However, ad-
justment for paternal height, weight, or body mass index
(BMI) did not attenuate the association with offspring
asthma (data not shown), suggesting that early smoking
effects on offspring asthma were not mediated through the

 impact

and
metabolic
development.
The findings relating to occupational welding support
the concept that young men’s environmental exposures im-
pact their offspring’s health. Welding represents a com-
plex, mixed exposure that is associated with cancer and
respiratory diseases. In addition, welding may cause heat-
ing of the groin region that can affect spermatozoa.
Animal studies have shown effects on sperm, which could
affect subsequent generations.15–17
A father’s pre-conception exposures were related to a
non-allergic asthma phenotype in offspring, suggesting
that the effect is on lung function development rather than
allergy (early frequent infections might be implicated). One
may question whether growth and other chronic diseases
in offspring might also be affected by a father’s environ-
mental exposures before parenthood.
The strengths of the present study include repeated de-
tailed smoking assessment in a large cohort, allowing ana-
lyses of effect modification and restricted subgroups (i.e.
smoked only before conception). A limitation is the lack of
information on smoking for the non-RHINE participating
parent. As smokers’ spouses more often smoke themselves,
this would attenuate observed differences between mothers’
and fathers’ smoking effects; thus, true differences by parent
gender may be larger than observed. Asthma status and birth
year were missing for 1961 subjects with data on fathers’
smoking; sensitivity analyses suggested that this did not influ-
ence the results (see Supplementary data, available at IJE on-
line). Lacking information on the offspring’s own smoking is
unlikely to have affected results on early-onset asthma.
Misclassification of offspring asthma is not likely to be
differential with regard to parental smoking debut and
duration. As parents might not be aware of their children’s
asthma status after childhood, late-onset asthma in par-
ticular could be underreported. Reporting bias is an un-
likely explanation for the results, as similar associations
were seen when using exposure data collected 10 years
prior
to
collecting
information
about
offspring
(see
Supplementary data, available at IJE online). The lack of
detail with regard to asthma phenotype in the offspring is a
limitation of the study. Confounding by socio-economic
status did not seem to explain our findings, as these
changed little with adjustment for parental education,
grandparental education and type of dwelling, and per-
sisted in persons with tertiary educated parents (see
Supplementary data, available at IJE online). An associ-
ation between paternal smoking and offspring asthma was
stronger in those who quit smoking prior to conception
(higher educational level, less potential for recall bias) than
in those who continued smoking after child birth (possibly
more recall bias). We did not have information about the
use of personal preventive equipment in relation to weld-
ing, but we controlled for paternal age at survey, which is
likely to account for potential changes in exposures over
time. The finding that smoking and welding starting after
the child’s birth had no association with offspring asthma
also supports a potentially causal effect. In general,
whereas negative findings could be related to error, it is un-
likely that systematic error has caused the observed associ-
ations. The potential role for unmeasured confounding in
our positive findings must still be kept in mind.
In conclusion, our results suggest that a father’s smok-
ing and welding exposure prior to conception increased the
risk for non-allergic early-onset asthma in his offspring
and that early smoking debut and long exposure duration
substantially increased the risk, even if the father quit ex-
posure years before conception. These results come from a

 large, population-based, multicentre study from northern
Europe and are consistent between areas with different
smoking and work habits and asthma prevalence. To our
knowledge, this is the first study on asthma risk in humans
that investigates in detail the effects of paternal exposures
prior to conception. Future research should attempt to rep-
licate these findings in other populations. Mechanistic
studies are now important to understand the detrimental
effect of paternal pre-conception smoking and welding, as
well as potential effect modification by in utero exposure.
Such investigations might provide targets for intervention
in terms of inducing protective mechanisms. Furthermore,
we believe that it is urgent to investigate other potentially
harmful exposures in young men, where occupational ex-
posures may be particularly important in high-income as
well as in low-income societies. Our findings should not
lessen efforts to improve maternal health, which is crucial
for offspring health, but they provide an unexpectedly
strong argument for also focusing on the environment of
young men.
