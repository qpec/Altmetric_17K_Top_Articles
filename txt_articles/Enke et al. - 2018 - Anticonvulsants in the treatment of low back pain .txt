AbstrAct
BackgRound: The use of anticonvul-
sants (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin) to 
treat low back pain has increased sub-
stantially in recent years despite limited 
supporting evidence. We aimed to 
determine the efficacy and tolerability 
of anticonvulsants in the treatment of 
low back pain and lumbar radicular pain 
compared with placebo.
Methods: A search was conducted in 
5 databases for studies comparing an 
anticonvulsant to placebo in patients 
with nonspecific low back pain, sciatica 
or neurogenic claudication of any dura-
tion. The outcomes were self-reported 
pain, disability and adverse events. Risk 
of bias was assessed using the Physio-
therapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale, 
and quality of evidence was assessed 
using Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development and Evalua-
tion (GRADE). Data were pooled and 
treatment effects were quantified using 
mean differences for continuous and risk 
ratios for dichotomous outcomes.
Results: Nine trials compared topira-
mate, gabapentin or pregabalin to 
 
placebo in 859 unique participants. 
Fourteen of 15 comparisons found anti-
convulsants were not effective to reduce 
pain or disability in low back pain or 
lumbar radicular pain; for example, 
there was high-quality evidence of no 
effect of gabapentinoids versus placebo 
on chronic low back pain in the short 
term (pooled mean difference [MD] –0.0, 
95% confidence interval [CI] –0.8 to 0.7) 
or for lumbar radicular pain in the imme-
diate term (pooled MD –0.1, 95% CI –0.7 
to 0.5). The lack of efficacy is accompa-
nied by increased risk of adverse events 
from use of gabapentinoids, for which 
the level of evidence is high.
InteRpRetatIon: There is moderate- to 
high-quality evidence that anticonvul-
sants are ineffective for treatment of 
low back pain or lumbar radicular pain. 
There is high-quality evidence that 
gaba 
pentinoids have a higher risk for 
adverse events. protocol registration:

M
illions of people have low back pain, which causes more 
disability than any other health condition.1 Most people 
with low back pain have symptoms resulting from non-
specific causes. About 5% to 10% of people with low back pain 
have sciatica,2 in which the leg pain follows the sciatic nerve and 
can be accompanied by strength, sensory and reflex changes in 
the leg.3 A smaller proportion of people have neurogenic claudica-
tion, in which the leg pain is associated with spinal stenosis and 
symptoms are exacerbated with extension activities (e.g., walking) 
and relieved by flexion (e.g., sitting).4 Leg pain originating from the 
lumbar spine is commonly referred to as radicular pain.5
Clinical guidelines on the treatment of low back pain generally 
recommend nonpharmacologic interventions and nonopioid analge-
sics,6,7 rather than stronger analgesics such as anticonvulsants.6 How-
ever, the increasing use of anticonvulsant medicines in patients with 
low back pain has been reported.8 Such an increase could be justified 
if these drugs relieve symptoms and the benefits outweigh harms. 
The latter is important, as recent reports point to an increased risk of 
suicidality9 and the potential for misuse 10,11 of some anticonvulsants.
The analgesic action of anticonvulsant medicines is thought to be 
a result of limiting neuronal excitation and enhancing inhibition.12 
Anticonvulsant medicines such as gabapentin and pregabalin, some-
times called gabapentinoids, have been shown to be effective in neu-
ropathic pain conditions such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy.13 
However, the evidence for the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants 
in low back and lumbar radicular pain is unclear and can be resolved 
only by high-quality evidence produced from placebo-controlled 
 
trials. Previous reviews were limited only to populations with chronic 
back pain,14 and new evidence may affect conflicting and limited 
conclusions.5,15 Therefore, this systematic review aimed to determine 
the efficacy and tolerability of anticonvulsants in the treatment of 
low back pain and lumbar radicular pain compared with placebo.

Methods
study registration
A protocol was prospectively registered on the International 
 
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; 
CRD42016046363). 
search strategy and study inclusion
We performed electronic database searches on MEDLINE, 
Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register for 
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the WHO International Clinical 
Trials Registry Platform from inception to December 2017. 
We searched for randomized parallel and crossover controlled 
trials investigating the effects of anticonvulsants in adults with 
nonspecific low back pain with or without radiating leg pain, sciat-
ica or neurogenic claudication secondary to lumbar spinal stenosis 
of any duration. We excluded studies investigating pain in preg-
nancy or after surgery. Studies of participants with mixed condi-
tions (e.g., low back and neck pain) were also excluded, unless the 
results were reported separately or were obtained from authors.
To be eligible, studies had to compare an anticonvulsant (as 
classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating 
Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology, N03A Antiepileptics)16 to 
placebo, and report any outcome of pain intensity (e.g., numerical 
rating scale), disability (e.g., Roland–Morris Disability Question-
naire) or adverse events. The anticonvulsant intervention was to be 
administered in primary care via any route (e.g., oral, topical, intra-
venous injection), without imaging assistance or extended time for 
administration (e.g., intravenous infusion). The protocol allowed 
active control (e.g., another pharmacologic intervention), but the 
current report is limited to placebo comparisons only, to focus on 
efficacy. Comparative effectiveness trials comparing 2 active drug 
treatments of unknown efficacy provide ambiguous results, as it is 
not possible to establish whether the winning drug is the least 
harmful of the 2 or the most effective of the 2.
We developed a search strategy using keywords for randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) and low back pain or sciatica published by the 
Cochrane Back and Neck Group,17 plus keywords to identify anticon-
vulsants based on a recent Cochrane review18 and the WHO Collabo-
rating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology Anatomical Therapeutic 
Chemical (ATC) classification of antiepileptics16 (Appendix 1, available 
at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.171333/-/DC1). 
There was no language or publication restriction. We contacted the 
principal authors of unpublished studies for more information if eligi-
bility was unclear, and searched reference lists of included trials and 
related systematic reviews to identify potentially relevant studies. 
Title and abstract screening was performed by 1 reviewer (O.E.), 
and an independent reviewer was consulted if there were any uncer-
tainties. Two reviewers (O.E., H.A.N.) independently screened full-text 
articles for eligibility. Disagreements were resolved by discussion first, 
then arbitration by a third, independent reviewer (C.G.M.).
data extraction and risk of bias assessment
We used standardized and piloted data extraction forms to 
record the characteristics of the participants, intervention and 
outcomes. Two reviewers extracted the data (2 of O.E., H.A.N. or 
C.-W.C.L.). Reviewers did not assess any study to which they had 
contributed. Disagreements were resolved by discussion first, 
then arbitration by an independent reviewer (C.H.N.) if needed. 
For crossover trials, we planned to confine data extraction to the 
pre-crossover data to avoid a potential carryover effect. How-
ever, this was not possible, owing to the lack of data; therefore, 
we took all measurements from the anticonvulsant and placebo 
periods and analyzed these as if the trial was a parallel group 
trial of anticonvulsant versus placebo.19 We accounted for the 
risk for a carryover effect secondary to a crossover design when 
assessing the quality of the evidence by downgrading 1 level.
For pain and disability outcomes, we extracted data at these 
time points: immediate (≤ 2 wk after randomization), short 
(> 2 wk but ≤ 3 mo), intermediate (> 3 but < 12 mo) and long 
(≥ 12 mo) term. If multiple time points were reported within 
1 follow-up period, we used the time closest to 2 weeks, 7 weeks, 
6  months and 12 months for each follow-up period, respectively. 
For safety outcomes, we extracted the number of participants 
with any serious adverse events and adverse events over the 
course of the study.
Two reviewers (O.E., H.A.N.) independently assessed the risk 
of bias of individual studies using the 11-item Physiotherapy Evi-
dence Database (PEDro) scale,20,21 with disagreements resolved 
by consensus. The PEDro scale is widely used and has been 
shown to be a valid and reliable tool for assessing the risk of bias 
of clinical and pharmacologic trials.21 It shows a high positive 
correlation (0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 0.88) with 
the Cochrane Risk of bias tool.21 Its items show no redundancy; 
therefore, it is valid to combine the items to obtain a total PEDro 
score as a measure for risk of bias.22
statistical analysis
For pain and disability outcomes, included studies were grouped 
first by the type of pain (nonspecific low back pain or lumbar 
radicular pain), then by anticonvulsant medicine, outcome and 
follow-up time point. Lumbar radicular pain included sciatica 
and neurogenic claudication secondary to lumbar spinal sten-
osis. Anticonvulsant medicines with similar modes of action were 
grouped together; e.g., gabapentin and pregabalin.23 Where 
appropriate, data were pooled and treatment effects were quan-
tified using mean differences (MDs; if the same scale was used) or 
standardized mean differences (SMDs; if different scales were 
used) for continuous outcomes (pain and disability) using a 
random-effects model, and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes 
(adverse events). We considered a between-group difference of 
10% or more on the scale used for pain or disability to be clin-
ically worthwhile.24 For safety outcomes, we grouped the 
included studies by the anticonvulsant medicine only. We con-
ducted the analysis using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis V3 (Bio-
stat, Englewood, NJ).
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed clinical and methodological heterogeneity and 
undertook pooling if heterogeneity was acceptable (e.g., I2 < 
75%)19 using a random-effects model. Clinical and methodo-
logic 
al heterogeneity was also considered when grading the level

of evidence (Appendix 2, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.171333/-/DC1). 
grading of evidence
We assessed the overall quality of evidence using a Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
(GRADE) approach,25 which considered study design, risk of bias, 
imprecision and inconsistency. We did not assess publication bias 
and indirectness, as there were insufficient studies and all studies 
were of the population of interest. The quality of evidence was 
downgraded by 1 or 2 levels for each domain, depending on 
whether a serious or a very serious flaw was present (Appendix 2). 
GRADE was applied in panel discussions and consensus was used 
to resolve any disagreement.
Results
The search resulted in 1240 records, of which 93 full-text articles 
were assessed. Common reasons for exclusion after full-text 
screening were related to the study design or population 
(Figure 1). Nine eligible studies were included, with a total of 
859 participants (Table 1).26–34 The average 
age of participants was 50.8 years (range 
38.0 to 71.1 yr) in the treatment group and 
51.5 years (range 24.0 to 74.0 yr) in the pla-
cebo group. Six trials were RCTs26,27,30,32–34 
and 3 were randomized crossover 
 
trials28,29,31 for which pre-crossover results 
were not reported. All but 1 trial28 had low 
risk of bias (PEDro scale ≥ 7, Appendix 3, 
available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.171333/-/DC1), but 
3 studies had a dropout rate of greater 
than 15%.29,33,34 There was near-perfect 
agreement between reviewers (O.E., 
H.A.N.) on the risk of bias assessment, with 
only 4 of 99 items (4%) requiring discussion 
and a consensus decision.
Four trials recruited participants with 
chronic low back pain with or without radi-
ating leg pain,26,31–33 and 5 trials recruited 
participants with lumbar radicular pain (4 
in sciatica,27,28,30,34 1 in neurogenic claudi-
cation29). Only 1 trial included participants 
with acute symptoms (< 3 mo).30 Three 
 
trials confirmed participant lumbar spine 
pathology radiographically (Appendix 4, 
available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.171333/-/DC1).28,29,34 The 
mean treatment duration was 6.7 weeks 
(range 10 d to 12 wk). The anticonvulsants 
investigated were gabapentinoids (prega-
balin27,29,30 or gabapentin26,31,32,34) and topi-
ramate.28,33 Most studies applied self-
reported numerical pain-rating scales 
(NPRSs),26,28–32,34 and 1 used a descriptor-
based pain rating index.33 Disability was reported using either the 
Oswestry Disability Index26,28,29,33 or Roland–Morris Disability 
Questionnaire.30 Most studies reported immediate or short-term 
data only.
efficacy of anticonvulsants for low back pain with or 
without radiating leg pain
Three trials investigated a gabapentinoid (gabapentin) versus pla-
cebo for chronic low back pain with or without radiating leg 
pain.26,31,32 There was no effect for pain in the short term (pooled MD 
–0.0, 95% CI –0.8 to 0.7 on a 0- to 10-point NPRS, 3 studies, Figure 2). 
The quality of evidence was high (Appendix 5, available at 
www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.171333/-/DC1) but 
2 studies31,32 investigated gabapentin below the recommended 
dose of 1800–3600 mg/d.35 Similarly, there was no treatment effect 
for pain in the intermediate term (MD –0.1, 95% CI –1.4 to 1.2 on a 0- 
to 10-point NPRS, 1 study) with low quality of evidence (down-
graded owing to study design and imprecision). One study investi-
gated disability in the short term only,26 and showed no treatment 
effect (MD  –0.2, 95% CI –5.9 to 5.5 on a 100-point Oswestry Disabil-
ity Index) with high-quality evidence.

One trial investigated topiramate against placebo for 
chronic low back pain with or without radiating leg pain.33 
There was a small, clinically worthwhile treatment effect 
favouring topiramate in pain in the short term (MD –11.4, 95% 
CI –16.7 to –6.1 on a 78-point pain scale), and no treatment 
effect for topiramate on disability in the short term (MD –4.9, 
95% CI –19.4 to 9.6 on a 100-point Oswestry Disability Index). 
These findings had moderate-quality evidence, downgraded 
owing to imprecision.
efficacy of anticonvulsants for lumbar radicular pain
Four studies investigated the efficacy of gabapentinoids (pregaba-
lin or gabapentin) versus placebo in patients with lumbar radicular 
pain,27,29,30,34 in which 3 studies provided data for inclusion in the 
forest plot29,30,34 (Figure 2). There was high-quality evidence of no 
effect on pain in the immediate term (pooled MD –0.1, 95% CI –0.7 
to 0.5 on a 0- to 10-point NPRS, 2 studies), but short-term results of 
2 studies had high heterogeneity (I2 = 95%) and therefore were not 
pooled. Whereas Yildirim and colleagues34 report pain relief with

did not detect an effect in a larger trial (MD 0.6, 95% CI –0.2 to 1.4

quality evidence of no effect on pain in the intermediate (MD –0.1,

(MD 0.4, 95% CI –0.5 to 1.3 on a 0- to 10-point NPRS, 1 study,30 
downgraded owing to imprecision), respectively. There was high-
quality evidence of no effect for disability in the immediate term 
(pooled SMD –0.1, 95% CI –0.3 to 0.2, 2 studies). Disability at all 
other time points (short-term MD 0.6, 95% CI –1.5 to 2.7; intermediate-
term MD –1.4, 95% CI –3.6 to 0.8; long-term MD 0.8, 95% CI –1.5 to 
3.1, all on a 23-point Roland–Morris Disability Questionnaire) 
showed no treatment effect, based on a single study,30 all with 
moderate-quality evidence (downgraded owing to imprecision). 
The fourth study did not provide pain severity or disability data, 
other than reporting descriptively that no between-group differ-
ence was found in disability at the short-term follow-up.27
One study investigated topiramate versus placebo for lumbar 
radicular pain.28 There was no treatment effect favouring topira-
mate in pain (MD –0.7, 95% CI –2.1 to 0.6 on a 0- to 10-point 
NPRS) and disability (MD –2.0, 95% CI –10.0 to 6.0 on a 100-point 
Oswestry Disability Index) in the immediate term. The quality of 
the evidence was very low for pain (downgraded owing to study 
design, risk of bias and imprecision) and low for disability (down-
graded owing to study design and risk of bias).

in each study group.28,29,31 Six of the 7 studies investigated the 
effects of gabapentinoids,26,27,29–31,34 with 16.4% of study partici-
pants originating from crossover studies.29,31 Pooled results indi-
cate high-quality evidence that gabapentinoids were associated 
with an increased risk of adverse events compared with placebo 
(pooled risk ratio [RR] 1.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.7, 6 studies). One 
study, which did not report the total numbers of participants 
experiencing an adverse event,32 found a total of 19 adverse 
events in 31 participants who received gabapentin for chronic 
low back pain, versus 13 adverse events in 34 participants in the 
placebo group. The most common adverse events reported in 
participants taking a gabapentinoid were drowsiness or somno-
lence, dizziness and nausea (Appendix 6, available at www.cmaj.
ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.171333/-/DC1).
Two studies investigated the effects of topiramate. Of these, 
1 study28 did not find an increased risk of adverse events associ-
ated with topiramate (RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.6). However, this 
study used an active placebo (diphenhydramine) that provided no 
known treatment effect, but had a similar sedative adverse event 
profile to topiramate. The quality of evidence was very low (down-
graded owing to study design, risk of bias and imprecision). The 
second study did not report the total number of participants who 
experienced an adverse event,33 but showed 21 adverse events in 
the topiramate (n = 48) and 10 in the placebo (n = 48) group.
We planned to analyze serious adverse events and adverse 
events separately, but only 2 studies made this distinction in 
their reporting.27,30 Both studies compared pregabalin 600 mg/d 
versus placebo in patients with lumbar radicular pain. There was 
no between-group difference in serious adverse events (pooled 
RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.1 to 12.2, moderate-quality evidence, down-
graded owing to imprecision).
other analyses
For the subgroup analysis, only 1 study included patients with 
acute and chronic symptoms.30 When the effect of pregabalin 
was analyzed separately for patients with acute and chronic sci-
atica, there was no treatment effect for pain or disability at all 
time points for duration of either symptom. The planned sensi-
tivity analysis based on risk of bias was not conducted because 
of the low number of included studies.
Interpretation
This systematic review found 9 placebo-controlled randomized 
trials investigating the effects of anticonvulsants for low back 
pain and lumbar radicular pain. For chronic low back pain with 
or without radiating leg pain, there was high-quality evidence 
showing that gabapentinoids did not reduce pain or disability 
compared with placebo in the short term, and similarly with low-
quality evidence in the intermediate term. There was moderate-
quality evidence that topiramate provided a small clinically 
worthwhile effect for pain in the short term, but there was no 
effect on disability. For lumbar radicular pain, there was gener-
ally moderate- to high-quality evidence showing that anticonvul-
sants had no effect on pain or disability at all time points. For 
adverse events, there was high-quality evidence showing that 
gabapentinoids were associated with increased adverse events, 
and very low-quality evidence showing that topiramate did not 
increase the risk of adverse events compared with placebo.
For chronic low back pain and neurogenic claudication, similar 
recent reviews also did not find any treatment benefit for anticonvul-
sants.5,14 Unlike our review, which focuses on comparisons with 
placebo-controlled trials, Shanthanna and colleagues14 compared 
anticonvulsants with other active treatments for chronic low back 
pain, and found a small but not clinically worthwhile difference 
favouring other active treatments (MD 0.4 on a 0- to 10-point pain 
scale, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.64, 3 studies, very low-quality evidence). Our 
findings differ from previous evidence on anticonvulsants for lumbar 
radicular pain, in which a 2012 BMJ review reported a treatment bene-
fit of gabapentin based on a single trial.15 One key reason for the dif-
ference in our review is the inclusion of a 2017 study that found prega-
balin was no more effective than placebo in patients with sciatica.30
Clinically, the prescription of anticonvulsants for back and neck 
pain, including radicular pain in primary care, has increased by 535% 
in the last 10 years.36 This trend may be due to prescribers seeking 
an alternative to opioids.37 We have shown, with mostly high- and 
 
moderate-quality evidence, that common anticonvulsants are inef-
fective for chronic low back pain and lumbar radicular pain, and are 
accompanied by increased risk of adverse events. Our findings are in 
line with recent United States and United Kingdom guidelines for low 
back pain,6,7 which do not recommend the use of anticonvulsants. 
Regarding sciatica, the 2016 UK guideline recommends following 
neuropathic pain guidelines,6 which endorse the use of gabapenti-
noids.38 However, the recommendation of gabapentinoids for sciat-
ica should be reviewed in light of emerging evidence.
limitations
This prospectively registered review used a sensitive search 
strategy with no limitation on language or publication type. All 
but 1 included trial28 had low risk of bias and most studies pro-
vided adequate data that could be integrated into a meta-
analysis. The meta-analysis separated results by pain type and 
anticonvulsant drug and included the most complete selection of 
all available placebo-controlled studies on this topic and accu-
rate effect size estimates. We acknowledge, however, that the 
initial title and abstract screening was performed by 1 author, 
but full-text screening and data management involved at least 
2 authors. The current body of evidence is small, as only 3 anti-
convulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin and topiramate) were 
included, and only 1 trial included patients with acute symp-
toms.30 We chose to include only placebo-controlled trials to 
investigate efficacy, but future reviews could include active-
controlled trials as well. Some evidence is based on single-trial 
results; thus, some results show imprecision owing to wide effect 
size distribution.
conclusion
Evidence to date does not support the use of anticonvulsants for 
chronic low back pain or lumbar radicular pain. This review 
found mostly moderate- to high-level quality of evidence sug-
gesting no treatment benefit for pain and disability, and high-
level evidence supporting the risk of harms.
