� Context.—Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a major cause
of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, and HPV
(and/or surrogate marker p16) status has emerged as a
prognostic marker that significantly impacts clinical
management. There is no current consensus on when to
test oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas for HPV/p16
or on which tests to choose.
Objective.—To develop evidence-based recommenda-
tions for the testing, application, interpretation, and
reporting of HPV and surrogate marker tests in head and
neck carcinomas.
Design.—The College of American Pathologists con-
vened a panel of experts in head and neck and molecular
pathology, as well as surgical, medical, and radiation
oncology, to develop recommendations. A systematic
review of the literature was conducted to address 6 key
questions. Final recommendations were derived from
strength of evidence, open comment period feedback,
and expert panel consensus.
Results.—The major recommendations include (1) test-
ing newly diagnosed oropharyngeal squamous cell carci-
noma patients for high-risk HPV, either from the primary
tumor or from cervical nodal metastases, using p16
immunohistochemistry with a 70% nuclear and cytoplas-
mic staining cutoff, and (2) not routinely testing non-
squamous oropharyngeal carcinomas or nonoropharyngeal
carcinomas for HPV. Pathologists are to report tumors as
HPV positive or p16 positive. Guidelines are provided for
testing cytologic samples and handling of locoregional and
distant recurrence specimens.
Conclusions.—Based on the systematic review and on
expert panel consensus, high-risk HPV testing is recom-
mended for all new oropharyngeal squamous cell carcino-
ma patients, but not routinely recommended for other
head and neck carcinomas.

T
ranscriptionally active human papillomavirus (HPV) has
been identified as an important cause of oropharyngeal
carcinoma.1–5 Human papillomavirus–positive oropharyn-
geal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has shown a
significant increase in incidence during the past several
decades, in contrast to conventional smoking- and alcohol-
related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC),
which has decreasing incidence.1,5 The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention estimates that there are more than
16 000 cases of HPV-positive OPSCC per year in the United
States.6 These represent between 60% and 80% of all
OPSCC in the United States and Canada. Rates in many
northern European countries also seem to be high, whereas
rates in other parts of Europe are closer to 15% to 30%.
Human papillomavirus–positive OPSCC rates are more
variable
in
other
continents
but
also
appear
to
be
substantially lower than for North America. For example,
in India, rates may be less than 5%, and another large study
found HPV-positive OPSCC rates of 16% across Europe,
36% in Central and South America, and 17% in Asia.7–10
Patients with HPV-positive OPSCC tend to be younger,
former- or nonsmokers, and male, with risk factors for
exposure to high-risk HPV (HR-HPV).2,11–13 The squamous
cell carcinomas (SCCs) in these patients tend to have

 members are listed in the Appendix. Disclosures of interest judged
by the oversight group to be conflicts are as follows: R.R.S, research
grants, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, Maryland);
W.H.W., consultancy, Merck & Co, (Kenilworth, New Jersey).
The majority of EP members (9 of 11) were assessed as having no
relevant conflicts of interest. The CAP provided funding for the
administration of the project; no industry funds were used in the
development of the guideline. All panel members volunteered their
time and were not compensated for their involvement, except for
the contracted methodologist. Please see the supplemental digital
content for full details on the conflict of interest policy.
Objective
The scope of the panel was to develop evidence-based
recommendations for the various methodologies and applications
of HR-HPV testing in head and neck carcinomas. The key
questions are listed as follows:
1. Should patients with newly diagnosed OPSCC, nonorophar-
yngeal SCC (non-OPSCC), oropharyngeal non-SCC, non-
oropharyngeal non-SCC, and cervical nodal metastatic
carcinomas of unknown and/or known primary be routinely
tested for HR-HPV?
2. Do relevant clinical outcomes of specific tests or testing
algorithms for HR-HPV differ based on items such as specimen
size, type and length of tissue fixation, or the criteria/definition
for a positive p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) or in situ
hybridization (ISH) test?
3. For patients with OPSCC, non-OPSCC, and cervical nodal
metastatic SCC, what is the optimal method of reporting HPV
test results to best inform patients and clinicians about the
clinical significance of the results (including considerations
about uncertainty)?
4. Should patients with recurrent/persistent OPSCC, non-OPSCC,
and cervical nodal metastatic SCC be routinely tested for HR-
HPV?
5. Should patients with locally and/or regionally recurrent
OPSCC, non-OPSCC, and cervical nodal metastatic SCC be
routinely tested for HR-HPV?
6. Should patients with distant disease be tested for HR-HPV?
Refer to the supplemental digital content for all of the
subquestions under these main key questions.
Literature Search and Collection
A comprehensive search for literature was initially performed in
MEDLINE using the OvidSP interface on March 3, 2014,
encompassing the publication dates of January 1, 1995, to March
3, 2014. A supplemental literature search was completed in
PubMed (March 26, 2014) encompassing the publication dates of
January 1, 1995, to March 26, 2014. An additional literature search
was performed using Scopus (March 29, 2014) to identify relevant
articles published between January 1, 1995, and March 29, 2014, in
journals not indexed in MEDLINE. The literature search of the
electronic databases was conducted in 2 arms: the first combined
medical subject headings and keywords to address the concepts
head and neck neoplasms, human papillomavirus (HPV), and
laboratory testing, and the second combined medical subject
headings and keywords for the concepts head and neck neoplasms,
human papillomavirus (HPV), and outcomes. The results of both arms
of the search were combined and deduplicated. Limits were set for
human studies published in English, and a publication filter was
applied to exclude lower levels of evidence such as letters,
commentaries, editorials, and case reports.
A search for gray (unindexed) literature included a review of
guideline and systematic review repository sites (eg, Guidelines
International Network, National Guideline Clearinghouse, Co-
chrane Library, Prospero, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination),
and relevant medical organizations’ Web sites to identify guide-
lines, protocols, and standards. A review of meeting abstracts
smaller primary tumors, but present with early nodal 
metastases.1,3 As a group, patients with HPV-positive 
OPSCC have improved clinical outcomes compared with 
patients with conventional, HPV-negative HNSCC when 
managed by similar modalities.2,11–13
Testing for HR-HPV in HNSCC has become increasingly 
important during the past decade. Determining that an 
OPSCC is positive for HR-HPV (by strictly defined testing in 
the correct clinical and pathologic contexts) has significant 
implications for patient prognosis, and it is now integrated 
into the recently updated American Joint Committee on 
Cancer (AJCC) staging manual14; furthermore, HPV status 
determines patient eligibility for clinical trials investigating 
new treatment regimens and modalities.15,16 In addition, 
determining that a metastatic SCC of unknown primary to a 
cervical lymph node is HPV positive strongly points to the 
oropharynx as the site of origin, with consequences for 
subsequent clinical management and treatment deci-
sions.15–19 For these reasons, several organizations, includ-
ing the College of American Pathologists (CAP), the Royal 
College of Pathologists, and Cancer Care Ontario, have 
supported the establishment of evidence-based guidelines 
for HR-HPV testing in HNSCC.17,20
There are many important questions about HR-HPV 
testing that remain to be answered by evidence-based 
guidelines, including which anatomic sites and subtypes of 
HNSCC warrant HPV testing, when and how to test tissue 
specimens, and what should be done with fine-needle 
aspiration (FNA) samples.21–26 In 2013, the CAP appointed 
an 11-person expert panel (EP) and a 9-person advisory 
panel to address these and other related questions to 
formulate a comprehensive set of recommendations.
METHODS
This evidence-based guideline was developed following the 
standards endorsed by the National Academy of Medicine, 
formerly the Institute of Medicine.27 A detailed description of the 
methods and a systematic review (including the quality assessment 
and complete analysis of the evidence) used to create this guideline 
can be found in the supplemental digital content.
Panel Composition
The CAP convened an EP consisting of members with expertise 
in head and neck and molecular pathology and surgical, medical, 
and radiation oncology to develop the guideline. In addition, a 
research methodologist consultant served on the EP for the 
systematic review of the evidence. An advisory panel consisting 
of 2 patient advocates, 4 pathologists, 1 medical oncologist/
molecular epidemiologist, 1 radiation oncologist, and 1 method-
ologist assisted the EP. The following organizations provided 
official panel representation: the American Academy of Otolaryn-
gology—Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American 
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and the American Society 
of Cytopathology.
In addition, the guideline was submitted to ASCO’s Head and 
Neck Guideline Advisory Group and ASCO’s Clinical Practice 
Guideline Committee for review of the final manuscript. No 
suggestions for revisions were proposed, and it was agreed that the 
guideline should be considered for endorsement by ASCO.
Conflict of Interest Policy
In accordance with the CAP conflict of interest policy (in effect 
April 2010), members of the EP disclosed all financial interests from 
12 months prior to appointment throughout the development of 
this guideline. Individuals were instructed to disclose any 
relationship that could be interpreted as constituting an actual, 
potential, or apparent conflict. Complete disclosures of the EP
2 Arch Pathol Lab Med
HPV Testing Head & Neck Carcinomas: CAP Guideline—Lewis et al
 published in the years 2012–2014 from pathology and oncology
organizations and EP recommendations completed the systematic
literature review. The Ovid search was rerun on July 11, 2016, to
identify articles published since March 1, 2014, that provided
information that would alter the recommendations in any way.
Detailed information regarding the literature search strategy can
be found in the supplemental digital content.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Practice guidelines, consensus documents, systematic reviews,
meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), comparative
studies, reviews, case-controlled studies, case series, and evaluation
studies were eligible for inclusion.
Published studies were selected for full-text review if they met
each of the following criteria:
1. Patients with tissue or cytology aspiration material taken from
the workup of
� Oropharyngeal primaries
� Cervical nodal metastasis of unknown primary
� Regional or distant metastasis from known or suspected
oropharyngeal primary
� Other head and neck sites (eg, sinonasal)
� All carcinomas in the head and neck
2. Human studies
3. Patients of all ages and either sex
4. Studies published in English
5. The study compared, prospectively or retrospectively, laboratory
testing methodologies or potential testing algorithms for HPV
testing
6. The study addressed one of the key questions
7. The study included measurable data such as the negative
predictive value or positive predictive value, if testing method-
ologies used to determine HPV status, alone and in combina-
tion; negative and positive concordance across the platforms;
sensitivity and specificity of individual tests; and accuracy in
determining HPV status.
Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were
noncomparative or qualitative studies, including editorials, com-
mentaries, or letters; animal studies; full-text articles not available
in English; studies that included patients with other tumor types
not specified in the inclusion criteria; studies that did not include
relevant measurable data; and studies that did not address at least
one of the key questions.
Detailed information about the inclusion and exclusion criteria is
available in the supplemental digital content.
Quality Assessment
An assessment of study quality was performed by a research
methodologist for all fully published studies meeting inclusion
criteria. Studies only available in abstract form did not undergo
formal quality assessment. Formal quality assessment involved
determining the risk of bias by assessing key indicators, based on
study design and methodologic rigor. Refer to the supplemental
digital content for the definitions of ratings for strength of evidence
(Supplemental Table 1) and for the quality assessment results.
Assessing the Strength of Recommendations
Development of recommendations required that the panel
review the identified evidence and make a series of key judgments.
Grades for strength of recommendations were developed by the
CAP Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center and are described in
Table 1.
Guideline Revision
This guideline will be reviewed every 4 years, or earlier in the
event of publication of substantive and high-quality evidence that
could potentially alter the original guideline recommendations. If
necessary, the entire panel will reconvene to discuss potential
changes. When appropriate, the panel will recommend revision of
the guideline to the CAP for review and approval.
Disclaimer
The CAP developed the Pathology and Laboratory Quality
Center as a forum to create and maintain evidence-based practice
guidelines and consensus statements. Practice guidelines and
consensus statements reflect the best available evidence and expert
consensus supported in practice. They are intended to assist
physicians and patients in clinical decision making and to identify
questions and settings for further research. With the rapid flow of
scientific information, new evidence may emerge between the time
a practice guideline or consensus statement is developed and when
it is published or read. Guidelines and statements are not
continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence.
Guidelines and statements address only the topics specifically
identified therein and are not applicable to other interventions,
diseases, or stages of diseases. Furthermore, guidelines and
statements cannot account for individual variation among patients
and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or
exclusive of other treatments. It is the responsibility of the treating
physician or other health care provider, relying on independent
experience and knowledge, to determine the best course of
treatment for the patient. Accordingly, adherence to any practice
guideline or consensus statement is voluntary, with the ultimate
determination regarding its application to be made by the physician
in light of each patient’s individual circumstances and preferences.
The CAP makes no warranty, express or implied, regarding
guidelines and statements and specifically excludes any warranties
of merchantability and fitness for a particular use or purpose. The
CAP assumes no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons

RESULTS
Of the 2803 unique studies identified in the systematic
review, 503 met inclusion criteria and underwent data
extraction. One hundred fifty-seven of these studies made
up
the
evidentiary
base
and
informed
the
guideline
statements (recommendations). The vast majority were
published, peer-reviewed articles, but 31 studies were
published only in abstract form. All 157 underwent data
extraction and qualitative analysis. Abstracts included in the
157 studies reported at least partial data. Those that did not
report data for any of the outcomes of interest were
excluded. Data from abstracts were used only in concert
with
peer-reviewed
data,
as
they
added
support
for
recommendation statements. Abstract data alone were not
used in the formulation of recommendations.
The EP met 16 times through Web-based meeting forums
from November 22, 2013, through September 21, 2016.
Additional work was completed via electronic mail. The EP
met in person February 8 and 9, 2014, to formally initiate the
project, and again April 9, 2016, to review the evidence to
date and draft recommendations.
A public comment period was held from July 18 to August
8, 2016, on the CAP Web site. Fourteen draft recommen-
dations, 2 demographic questions, and 3 questions about
feasibility were posted for feedback.

 ‘‘Agree’’ and ‘‘disagree’’ responses were captured for
every proposed recommendation. In addition, 269 written
comments were captured. Seven draft recommendations
achieved more than 90% agreement, 6 achieved between
80% and 90% agreement, and 1 received 57% agreement.
Each EP member was assigned 1 or 2 draft recommenda-
tions for which to review the public comments and to
present to the panel for group discussion. After consider-
ation of the comments, 6 draft recommendations were
maintained with the original language and 7 were revised.
Resolution of all changes was obtained by unanimous
consensus of the panel members using nominal group
technique (rounds of subsequent teleconference webinars
and email discussion). Final EP recommendations were
approved by a formal vote. The panel considered laboratory
efficiency and feasibility throughout the entire process,
although neither cost nor cost-effectiveness analyses were
performed. A description of the benefits and harms of
implementing the guideline statements is included in the
supplemental digital content.
An independent review panel, masked to the EP and
vetted through the conflict of interest process, provided final
approval on behalf of the CAP Council on Scientific Affairs.
In addition, the guideline was submitted to ASCO’s Head
and Neck Guideline Advisory Group and ASCO’s Clinical
Practice Guideline Committee for review of the final
manuscript. No suggestions for revisions were proposed
and it was agreed that the guideline should be considered
for endorsement by ASCO. The final recommendations are
summarized in Table 2, and an algorithmic approach for the
workup of patient specimens is provided in Figure 1.
GUIDELINE STATEMENTS
Statement 1.—Strong Recommendation.—Pathologists
should perform HR-HPV testing on all patients with newly
diagnosed OPSCC, including all histologic subtypes. This
testing may be performed on the primary tumor or on a
regional lymph node metastasis when the clinical findings
are consistent with an oropharyngeal primary.
The strength of evidence is convincing to support this
guideline statement.
The evidentiary base supporting this recommendation
comprised 110 studies, of which 1 was a meta-analysis,28 8
were subgroup analyses from RCTs,11,29–35 77 were obser-
vational studies,1,10,36–111 and 24 were studies only published
in abstract form.112–135 The meta-analysis received a quality
score of 7 out of a possible 11 points, and all supporting RCT
data had a risk of bias determined to be moderate. The
supporting observational studies ranged from low to
moderate risk of bias, with the exception of one study that
was assessed to have a high risk of bias.1 This study was a
retrospective cohort with retrospective data collection and
industry sponsorship. None of the other studies were found
to have methodologic flaws that would raise concerns about
the findings. Refer to Supplemental Table 2 in the
supplemental digital content for the quality assessment
results for studies included in the statement 1 evidentiary
base.
Breaking from a tradition that has broadly grouped all
carcinomas arising from the oral and oropharyngeal subsites
as oral cancer, these guidelines maintain a sharp distinction
between those carcinomas arising in the oropharynx and
those arising in the oral cavity proper. Testing for the
presence of HPV must be guided by a familiarity with head
and neck anatomy, including those structures that define the
oral cavity as separate from the oropharynx (Figure 2). The
oral cavity proper comprises the lips, gingiva, retromolar
trigone, hard palate, buccal mucosa, mobile tongue, and
floor of the mouth, whereas the oropharynx comprises the
palatine tonsils, soft palate, base of tongue (posterior to the
circumvallate papillae), and lateral and posterior pharyngeal
walls. Oropharyngeal tonsillar structures (ie, lingual and
palatine tonsils), particular hot spots for HPV-related
carcinogenesis, are present in the oropharynx, but not in
the oral cavity.
Oropharyngeal SCCs with transcriptionally active HR-
HPV represent a unique type of HNSCC. These HPV-
positive OPSCCs have risk-factor, demographic, morpho-
logic, molecular, and clinical profiles that stand apart from
other HNSCCs.
Human papillomavirus status of a primary or metastatic
OPSCC may have diagnostic, staging, and even therapeutic
implications. Currently, however, the call for routine HPV
testing reflects its standing as a powerful prognostic
indicator for patients with OPSCC. The literature over-
whelmingly supports the conclusion that HPV status is an
important and independent predictor of overall and disease-
specific survival for patients with OPSCC. The survival
benefit of HPV-positive OPSCC is maintained across nearly
all studies, despite significant heterogeneity in patient
populations, sample size, methods of HPV detection, tumor
stage, tumor treatment, comorbidity, and inclusion of
various other prognostic factors in the analysis. In large
prospective studies where patient populations with OPSCC
are uniformly staged and treated, significant reduction in
risk of progression and disease-related death is confirmed
for HPV-positive tumors.11,12,31,32,35

an HPV-positive SCC is high. 5Consider Epstein-Barr encoding region (EBER) in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus for the rare metastatic
nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma that is HR-HPV negative. 6Include comment, ‘‘Likely oropharyngeal primary.’’

 Testing for HR-HPV should be performed on all OPSCCs
regardless of histologic type. The morphologic spectrum of
HPV-positive OPSCC includes variants with papillary,
adenosquamous, lymphoepithelioma-like, sarcomatoid,
and basaloid features. Morphologic variation does not seem
to influence clinical behavior, and it does not abrogate the
need for HPV testing.136–138
In the open comment period, of the 168 respondents,
93.45% (n ¼ 157) agreed with the recommendation and
5.36% (n ¼ 9) disagreed. There were 22 written comments.
Most of these comments were directed at the method of
HPV testing and were, accordingly, taken into consideration
in the final drafting of statement 2. Others reflected
confusion about the anatomic definition of the oropharynx
and its distinction from the oral cavity. To highlight this
important distinction, a brief description of the anatomy of
the oropharynx and oral cavity has been provided.
Statement 2.—Recommendation.—For oropharyngeal tis-
sue specimens (ie, noncytology), pathologists should
perform HR-HPV testing by surrogate marker p16 IHC.
Additional HPV-specific testing may be done at the
discretion of the pathologist and/or treating clinician, or in
the context of a clinical trial.
The strength of evidence is adequate.
Sixty-seven studies (5 RCTs,11,29,32,34,35 48 observational
studies,* and 14 studies published in abstract form†) make
up the evidentiary base for statement 2. Of these studies, 31
reported on laboratory outcomes of interest (Table 3) and 51
on clinical outcomes (Table 4). The risk of bias assessment of
the majority of the included studies ranged from low to
Table 2.
Summary of Guideline Statements
Guideline Statement
Strength of
Recommendation
1. Pathologists should perform HR-HPV testing on all patients with newly diagnosed OPSCC,
including all histologic subtypes. This testing may be performed on the primary tumor or on a
regional lymph node metastasis when the clinical findings are consistent with an oropharyngeal
primary.
Strong recommendation
2. For oropharyngeal tissue specimens (ie, noncytology), pathologists should perform HR-HPV
testing by surrogate marker p16 IHC. Additional HPV-specific testing may be done at the
discretion of the pathologist and/or treating clinician, or in the context of a clinical trial.
Recommendation
3. Pathologists should not routinely perform HR-HPV testing on patients with nonsquamous
carcinomas of the oropharynx.
Expert consensus opinion
4. Pathologists should not routinely perform HR-HPV testing on patients with nonoropharyngeal
primary tumors of the head and neck.
Recommendation
5. Pathologists should routinely perform HR-HPV testing on patients with metastatic SCC of
unknown primary in a cervical upper or mid jugular chain lymph node. An explanatory note on
the significance of a positive HPV result is recommended.
Recommendation
6. For tissue specimens (ie, noncytology) from patients presenting with metastatic SCC of unknown
primary in a cervical upper– or mid–jugular chain lymph node, pathologists should perform p16
IHC.
Expert consensus opinion
Note: Additional HR-HPV testing on p16-positive cases should be performed for tumors
located outside of level II or III (nonroutine testing) in the neck and/or for tumors with
keratinizing morphology.
7. Pathologists should perform HR-HPV testing on head and neck FNA SCC samples from all
patients with known OPSCC not previously tested for HR-HPV, with suspected OPSCC, or with
metastatic SCC of unknown primary.
Expert consensus opinion
Note: No recommendation is made for or against any specific testing methodology for HR-
HPV testing in FNA samples. If the result of HR-HPV testing on the FNA sample is negative,
testing should be performed on tissue if it becomes available. If pathologists use cytology
samples for p16 IHC testing, they should validate the criteria (ie, cutoff) for a positive result.
8. Pathologists should report p16 IHC positivity as a surrogate for HR-HPV in tissue specimens (ie,
noncytology) when there is at least 70% nuclear and cytoplasmic expression with at least
moderate to strong intensity.
Expert consensus opinion
9. Pathologists should not routinely perform low-risk HPV testing on patients with head and neck
carcinomas.
Expert consensus opinion
10. Pathologists should not repeat HPV testing on patients with locally recurrent, regionally
recurrent, or persistent tumor if primary tumor HR-HPV status has already been established. If
initial HR-HPV status was never assessed or results are unknown, testing is recommended. HPV
testing may be performed on a case-by-case basis for diagnostic purposes if there is uncertainty
regarding whether the tumor in question is a recurrence or a new primary SCC.
Expert consensus opinion
11. Pathologists should not routinely perform HR-HPV testing on patients with distant metastases if
primary tumor HR-HPV status has been established. HPV testing may be performed on a case-
by-case basis for diagnostic purposes if there is uncertainty regarding whether the tumor in
question is a metastasis or a new primary SCC.
Expert consensus opinion
12. Pathologists should report primary OPSCCs that test positive for HR-HPV or its surrogate marker
p16 as HPV positive and/or p16 positive.
Expert consensus opinion
13. Pathologists should not provide a tumor grade or differentiation status for HPV-positive/p16-
positive OPSCCs.
Expert consensus opinion

 moderate, with only 2 studies assessed as high1,68 because of
industry funding. Although the vast majority of included
studies were retrospective cohorts, and the inherent
limitations of retrospective designs should be taken into
consideration, the collection of data did occur prospectively
in all but 2 studies.1,38 None of the other studies were found
to have methodologic flaws that would call into question the
study findings. Refer to Supplemental Table 3 in the
supplemental digital content for the quality assessment
results for all studies included in the statement 2 evidentiary
base.
Because the literature strongly supports that HR-HPV
status is independently prognostic in OPSCC and that it
should be routinely assessed, there is a need for consistency
in clinical practice. Which test or combination of HR-HPV
tests to perform is one of the more controversial issues in
head and neck pathology. There are numerous HPV-specific
tests, as well as the surrogate markers p16 IHC and
hematoxylin-eosin morphology to consider. Although it is
ideal to have a reference or standard criterion test, the
current literature does not clearly support one. The test
should be the one that best stratifies patient survival
outcomes while also being practical and inexpensive. p16
IHC is the test the EP considers to best fit that role. p16 is
markedly overexpressed in tumor cells with transcriptionally
active HR-HPV because the viral E7 oncoprotein destabi-
lizes pRb, functionally removing suppression of p16
expression and allowing tumor cells with high p16 levels
to bypass pRb-dependent cell cycle arrest. The result is
marked overexpression of p16, making it an excellent
surrogate marker of viral infection in the correct con-
text.139,140 Based on abundant literature on p16 IHC as an
independent predictor of improved patient prognosis in
OPSCC,‡ and on its widespread availability, ease and
reproducibility of interpretation,53 and excellent perfor-
mance on small specimen samples such as small biopsies
and tissue microarray punches,11,89,142 the EP recommends
that p16 testing be performed. Many consider the detection
of HR-HPV E6 and E7 messenger RNA (mRNA) by ISH as
the gold standard.89,143,144 Although this is an excellent test,
and perhaps even the ideal test from a purely scientific
perspective, it isn’t widely available for clinical use, is much
more expensive than p16, and is more technically challeng-
ing to perform, and the data do not show statistically better
performance than p16 IHC alone in OPSCC. Because p16 is
only a surrogate marker for HR-HPV, and its overexpression
is not always associated with the presence of HR-
HPV,53,75,81,89 as practice changes and HPV-specific tests
such as RNA ISH become more widely available clinically,
the latter may become the recommended test in the future.
For studies analyzing p16 IHC alone as a prognostic
marker, the majority found it to be a marker of favorable
outcome in multivariate analysis with univariate hazard
ratios for death between 0.2 and 0.5§ for overall, disease-
free, and/or disease-specific survival compared with p16-
negative patients. Several prospective and randomized
controlled studies showed p16 IHC to be strongly prognos-
tic alone as well.11,12,32,145 In many of the studies, data
extraction and summarization were complicated by p16
results, rather than being analyzed in isolation, being
combined with results of HPV-specific test(s) for analysis
and data reporting. Correlation rates between p16 IHC and
HPV-specific tests were generally high, and best for HPV
mRNA tests such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction and ISH.||
In addition to the aforementioned studies, some addi-
tional studies not included in our systematic review support
this recommendation. Sedghizadeh et al141 performed a

 systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining
p16 IHC expression and prognosis in OPSCC. Among the
18 studies finally included, they found that p16 status by
IHC was prognostic for all survival metrics with hazard
ratios between 0.3 and 0.4. Some newer studies compared
HR-HPV RNA ISH with p16 IHC and showed high
correlation between these tests (for high-incidence US
study populations) in OPSCC patients.146 In 3 large RNA
ISH-based studies, correlation rates were 92%, 96%, and
100.0%, respectively.89,143,144 Rooper et al147 showed that
almost all patients in their practice who were p16 positive
but HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ISH negative were
actually positive for HR-HPV by mRNA using ISH,
demonstrating that DNA ISH lacks sensitivity and that the
correlation between p16 overexpression and presence of
HPV mRNA is indeed high.
In the open comment period, of the 160 respondents,
89.44% (143) agreed with the recommendation, and 6.88%
(11) disagreed. There were 32 written comments, the
majority of which suggested that HPV-specific testing needs
to be performed because p16 IHC is not truly a surrogate
marker of HR-HPV. Additional comments pointed out that
there are patients with p16-positive and HPV-negative
tumors and vice versa. Although the latter 2 points are true,
these reflect the concept that p16 IHC is being done
specifically to ascertain if a patient’s tumor is related to
transcriptionally active HPV, rather than regarding it as a
prognostic biomarker. All of the many HPV-specific tests
that are available for use on tissue sections, such as DNA
polymerase chain reaction, DNA ISH, RNA reverse tran-
scriptase polymerase chain reaction, and RNA ISH, are
independently prognostic.11,12,29,70,141 There is no shortage of
data. However, none of these tests are statistically signifi-
cantly better than p16 IHC alone.53,81,89,92,148 Some studies,
particularly in lower–HPV-incidence regions (selected re-
gions of Europe, for example), have demonstrated that p16-
positive, HPV mRNA– and HPV DNA–negative patients
have a poorer prognosis than those patients positive for
both tests (although interestingly perhaps still better than
for p16 and HPV mRNA/DNA double-negative pa-
tients).75,77 Thus, p16 IHC alone may not be the right
approach in these other geographic regions. To allow for
discretion, the EP has provided the caveat that ‘‘HPV-
specific testing may be done at the discretion of the

Doing both p16 IHC and HPV-specific testing will
undoubtedly result in some patients with discrepant test
results. There is not currently strong evidence for what to do
in these situations, although it is probably good practice at
this time not to label patients with discrepant p16- and
HPV-specific test results as being in the prognostically
favorable category of HPV positive. Particular caution
should be exercised for laboratories currently using or
considering DNA ISH, because it has been shown to lack
sensitivity for HR-HPV and may lead to the above situation
(of test discrepancy) more frequently than HPV-specific
tests with higher sensitivity.53,81,89,149
Comments also dealt with method validation and
proficiency testing for p16 IHC. Although the literature
has little data comparing p16 IHC antibody clones and
methods, most of the studies, despite differing methodol-
ogies and clones, show strong, independent, and statistically
significant performance of p16 IHC alone as a prognostic
marker.11,32,81,141 Interestingly, most of the polled respon-
dents from a CAP practice patterns survey and other surveys
use the E6H4 antibody, and most of the studies in the
literature also have used it, consistently showing it to have
very good performance.11,53,81,84,89 There are not sufficient
data to recommend one antibody, platform, or set of test
conditions over another. However, as p16 IHC becomes part
of routine clinical practice in OPSCC, test validation and
method comparison studies will be critical, and proficiency
testing and benchmarking will likely become available.
Laboratories should choose tests and model their technical
performance after those large studies that validated p16 IHC
testing, and must validate their p16 IHC performance in
accordance with the IHC validation guideline previously
published by the CAP.150
Refer to Tables 3 and 4 for the summary of data for
laboratory and clinical outcomes for OPSCC tested with p16
IHC.
Statement 3.—Expert Consensus Opinion.—Pathologists
should not routinely perform HR-HPV testing on patients
with nonsquamous carcinomas of the oropharynx.
The strength of evidence is insufficient.
The vast majority of primary oropharyngeal carcinomas
are SCCs derived from the epithelium lining the surface of
the oropharynx and the tonsillar crypts, but a subset are
carcinomas of minor salivary gland origin. Even less
commonly, high-grade neuroendocrine (large and small

 cell) carcinomas arise within the oropharynx, sometimes in
association with an HPV-positive OPSCC.
Although HR-HPV may play an etiologic role in some
oropharyngeal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas, the
tumors tend to be clinically aggressive, regardless of HPV
status.151–153 In effect, HPV status does not appear to be a
reliable marker for separating aggressive and nonaggressive
tumors when it comes to high-grade neuroendocrine
carcinomas of the oropharynx. For carcinomas of minor
salivary gland origin, there is currently insufficient evidence
to support an etiologic role of HPV in these tumors, or to
validate the practice of HPV-testing them for prognostic
purposes.154–156 Almost all tested tumors have lacked
transcriptionally active HR-HPV.154,157,158 Accordingly, rou-
tine HPV testing is not recommended for nonsquamous
carcinomas of the oropharynx, including minor salivary
gland carcinomas and high-grade neuroendocrine carcino-
mas. On the other hand, the presence of glandular
differentiation by itself should not be taken as an exclusion
criterion for HPV testing. Oropharyngeal SCCs can some-
times exhibit glandular formations as a minor or predom-
inant tumor component, and these adenosquamous
carcinomas should undergo routine HPV testing as with
other variant forms of OPSCC (see statement 1). Case
reports of pure adenocarcinomas with transcriptionally
active HR-HPV have been described in the oropharynx
(similar to the uterine cervix), but they are so few that no
recommendation for testing can be provided.159,160
Importantly, conventional squamous differentiation, such
as surface dysplasia and keratinization, is not highly
developed in most HPV-positive OPSCCs. Instead, HPV-
positive OPSCCs are typically nonkeratinizing and show
varying degrees of basaloid differentiation.43,161 Human
papillomavirus testing should not be suspended in an
OPSCC because it lacks keratinization or exhibits basaloid
features, as long as it is proven, with IHC if necessary, to be
SCC and not a neuroendocrine or other nonsquamous
poorly differentiated carcinoma.
In the open comment period, of the 158 respondents,
88.61% (n ¼ 140) agreed with the recommendation, and
8.86% (n ¼ 14) disagreed. There were 14 written comments.
Most of these comments acknowledged the rarity of
nonsquamous carcinomas in the oropharynx and encour-
aged continued HPV testing of these tumors in the research
(not clinical) setting. Other comments expressed concerns
that statement 3 would inappropriately promote nontesting
of some OPSCCs because squamous differentiation is often
not readily apparent in those that are HPV positive.

The strength of evidence is adequate.
This recommendation is supported by 1 subgroup analysis
of 3 RCTs and 28 observational studies that met the
inclusion criteria for our systematic review.66,158,162–187 Two
of these studies were available only in abstract form and, as
such, did not undergo formal quality assessment.186 The
evaluable 27 studies were deemed to have varying risk of
bias: 5 were deemed low risk of bias,162,164,169,176,183 8 low to
moderate,¶ 10 moderate,# and 4 high.66,158,175,179 The high
risk of bias for the 4 studies was due to funding from
industry and missing information on the other assessment
criteria. Refer to Supplemental Table 4 for the quality
assessment results for statement 4 studies.
There is confusion among many pathologists and treating
physicians regarding the appropriateness of HPV testing in
nonoropharyngeal head and neck carcinomas. Because of
the considerable attention that HPV-positive OPSCC has
received, it is understandable that pathologists and treating
physicians may want to generalize that experience to
carcinomas arising outside the oropharynx, but the EP did
not find evidence to support this practice. Routine HPV
testing for nonoropharyngeal head and neck carcinomas is
not indicated because there is no proven prognostic or
therapeutic difference based on its presence or absence
(either by any of the various HPV-specific tests or by the
surrogate marker p16). If HPV testing were to yield a
positive result in a nonoropharyngeal carcinoma, it might
mislead treating physicians and patients as to the origin and
likely biologic behavior of the carcinoma. This does not
mean that there is no potential biological and clinical
significance for transcriptionally active HR-HPV in non-
oropharyngeal head and neck carcinomas (particularly in
specific anatomic subsites such as the nasopharynx or
sinonasal tract); it simply means that the clinical significance
and ramifications are not established at this time.
Although the EP does not recommend routinely testing
nonoropharyngeal carcinomas for HPV, it does recognize
that there are occasional situations where it may be
indicated. For example, if the anatomic site of tumor origin
is not provided, is ambiguous, and/or includes both an
oropharyngeal and a nonoropharyngeal site (eg, for large
tumors), then HPV testing may be appropriate. As another
example, for a patient who had a prior HPV-positive
OPSCC, HPV testing in a new non-OPSCC may be
appropriate to understand the relationship between the 2
carcinomas (ie, recurrence versus new primary). In these
settings, when HPV testing is performed, p16 IHC alone is
insufficient because of its suboptimal positive predictive
value in nonoropharyngeal sites. p16 IHC can be used to
screen a tumor using the same criteria as in the oropharynx.
If it is negative, then one can conclude that the tumor is not
related to transcriptionally active HR-HPV. If it is positive,
however, HPV-specific testing must be performed by one of
the available platforms (see algorithm).
The systematic review uncovered 16 studies that investi-
gated HPV testing in nonoropharyngeal head and neck
carcinomas (Table 5). These studies were heterogeneous in
anatomic subsites evaluated (eg, larynx, oral cavity, sino-
nasal tract, and other) and in the HPV testing methods used.
The studies found that the prevalence of HPV-positive
carcinomas, when considering all tests for HR-HPV, is
generally low in these nonoropharyngeal sites, ranging from
5.9% to 58.3%.** When more specific, RNA-based methods
for HPV detection were used, or p16 was combined with
HPV-specific testing in order to establish the presence of
transcriptionally active HR-HPV, the rates were 2.7% to
5.9%.175,189 Importantly, when the interpretation criteria
were reported and appropriate, the positive predictive value
of p16 IHC in nonoropharyngeal carcinomas was low,
ranging from 22% to 50%, because of the very low overall
rates of transcriptionally active HR-HPV in these tu-
mors.166,173,175,183,189
The systematic review identified 28 studies†† that inves-
tigated the clinical outcomes of nonoropharyngeal HPV-
positive carcinomas (Table 6). Once again, these studies
were highly variable in anatomic subsites examined and
HPV testing methods used and were also heterogeneous in
their reported outcomes. Only 7 studies reported a
statistically significant difference in overall, disease-free,
and/or progression-free survival between HPV-positive and
HPV-negative groups, including 5 that found that the
patients with HPV-positive carcinomas had better surviv-
al162,172,184,185 and 2 that actually found that the HPV-positive
group had worse survival.168,187,190 One additional study
found that the HPV-positive group had significantly lower
rates of recurrence.169

 Syrjanen196 pooled data from numerous heterogeneous
studies and found that the overall rates of HPV DNA in
laryngeal and sinonasal carcinomas were 28% and 27%,
respectively. Other studies using RNA-based HPV detection
methods on oral cavity and laryngeal carcinomas reported
HPV prevalences of 1.3% and 2.3%, respectively.197,198
In the open comment period, there were 154 respondents,
of whom 79.7% (n ¼ 123) agreed with the recommendation
and 12.3% (n ¼ 19) disagreed. There were 28 written
comments, including some that expressed disagreement
because they believed this statement included anogenital
sites. The recommendation was revised to specify that it was
applicable only to the head and neck. Some respondents
disagreed with the recommendation because of their
experience or reports of occasional HPV-positive tumors
arising in other nonoropharyngeal head and neck sites
(nasopharynx, oral cavity, hypopharynx, sinonasal tract, and
conjunctiva/lacrimal sac were all mentioned). Finally, a few
respondents felt the language should be changed to allow
testing in cases for which the precise anatomic location was
not given.

 Statement 5.—Recommendation.—Pathologists should
routinely perform HR-HPV testing on patients with
metastatic SCC of unknown primary in a cervical upper–
or mid–jugular chain lymph node. An explanatory note on
the significance of a positive HPV result is recommended.
The strength of evidence is adequate.
This statement is supported by 4 observational studies
that met the inclusion criteria for the systematic re-
view.199–202 Risk of bias assessments was deemed low in 2
studies200,202 and low to moderate in 2.199,201 None of these
studies were found to have methodologic flaws that would
raise concerns about the findings. Refer to Supplemental
Table 5 in the supplemental digital content for the quality
assessment results of included studies for statement 5.
Unknown primary is defined as any metastasis for which
the primary site has not been clinically identified at the time
the biopsy of the metastasis is performed. In this setting,
HR-HPV testing may aid in determining the most likely
primary site. Hence, HR-HPV status is important for patient
management as it informs the clinical team where to search
for the primary, or limits the likely area of primary if a
definitive lesion is not identified. There are inadequate data
at this time to support HR-HPV as a prognostic marker in
this setting.
In patients who have an unknown primary SCC in the
neck, it is common clinical practice to search for the primary
site by performing a thorough endoscopic examination and
directed biopsies of likely sources of disease, such as the
base of tongue, tonsils, and nasopharynx, as well as

 tonsillectomy if a primary is not identified on biopsy. The
majority of primary tumors can be identified with this
approach. Factors that favor an oropharyngeal primary site
include cervical (upper or mid jugular chain, synonymous
with levels II and III) metastasis location and HR-HPV
positivity.203,204 Thus, HR-HPV status is important because
positivity strongly favors oropharyngeal origin and can limit
treatment fields, even if a definitive primary is not identified.
In addition, more than 70% (to more than 90% in some
studies) of SCCs that initially present as an unknown
primary can ultimately be confirmed as oropharyngeal in
origin after a thorough search.203,205–208 Repeat HR-HPV
testing of the primary tumor, once biopsied or resected, as a
prognostic marker is not necessary because the metastasis
would have already been tested in this setting.
Although the systematic review revealed limited data, it
suggests better outcomes for patients with metastatic HPV-
positive compared with HPV-negative SCC in metastases of
unknown primary. Refer to Tables 7 and 8 for a summary of
laboratory data and clinical outcomes for metastatic SCCs of
unknown primary. However, most studies had small patient
numbers and/or lacked statistical significance, and thus
additional evidence is needed before HR-HPV status can be
considered a reliable prognostic marker in SCCs of
unknown primary.199–202,209–211
It is important that HR-HPV testing is routinely per-
formed only in metastases of unknown primary located in
the appropriate (cervical, specifically upper and mid jugular
chain) lymph node groups. The upper and mid jugular chain
includes level II and III lymph node groups. The pretest

HPV Testing Head & Neck Carcinomas: CAP Guideline—Lewis et al
 probability of a positive HR-HPV result is high in this
location because HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCCs almost
always metastasize here, and the primary tumor is often
clinically occult.212,213 Up to one-third of HPV-positive
OPSCCs present as an unknown primary (compared with
5%–10% of all head and neck cancers).212,214 Thus, HR-HPV
testing should be performed in all unknown primary cervical
upper– or mid–jugular chain metastases.
In contrast, HR-HPV testing should not be routinely
performed on metastases of unknown primary outside of
the cervical upper– and mid–jugular chain region. Non–
upper- and mid-jugular chain lymph node groups include
level I (submandibular/submental), level IV (lower jugular),
level V (posterior triangle), level VI (pretracheal/prelaryng-
eal/Delphian) and level VII (superior mediastinal), as well as
parotid and supraclavicular nodes. The probability of an
HPV-positive metastasis of unknown primary in the above
locations is extremely low in the absence of concurrent
upper/mid–jugular involvement, and therefore routine HR-
HPV testing is not indicated. However, HR-HPV testing
may be performed on a non–upper/mid-jugular chain
metastasis when clinical suspicion for an HPV-positive
SCC is high (‘‘nonroutine’’ HR-HPV testing).
It is recognized that the specific lymph node group may
not always be known to the pathologist examining the
metastasis. Some may simply be labeled ‘‘right neck’’ or
‘‘left neck’’ by the ordering physician. Review of the medical
record (clinical notes and/or radiology reports) or directly
contacting the ordering physician will likely provide
sufficient information to identify the involved lymph node
group in most cases. There may be rare cases that cannot be
localized even after attempts to obtain clinical information.
In such cases, HR-HPV testing should be performed.
An explanatory note in the pathology report describing
the clinical significance of a positive HR-HPV result is
recommended, specifying that HPV-positive SCC metasta-
ses most likely originate from the oropharyngeal tonsils
and/or base of tongue but rarely may be from other sites (ie,
nasopharynx).
In the open comment period, there were 149 respondents;
85.23% (n ¼ 127) agreed, and 11.41% (n ¼ 17) disagreed.
There were 22 written comments, including several com-
ments questioning the method of HR-HPV testing, which is
the subject of statement 6. Several comments were either in
support of or against an explanatory note.
Statement 6.—Expert Consensus Opinion.—For tissue
specimens (ie, noncytology) from patients presenting with
metastatic SCC of unknown primary in a cervical upper– or
mid–jugular chain lymph node, pathologists should perform
p16 IHC.
Note: Additional HPV-specific testing on p16-positive
cases should be performed for tumors located outside of
level II or III (nonroutine testing) in the neck and/or for
tumors with keratinizing morphology.
Strength of evidence is insufficient.
p16 IHC is a very sensitive surrogate marker for HR-HPV
that also maintains high positive predictive value when the
pretest probability of an HPV-positive SCC is high.44,146,147
However, the positive predictive value decreases when the
pretest probability is low because p16 overexpression can
occur by mechanisms other than HR-HPV signaling. For
example, as many as 20% to 30% of aggressive head and
neck cutaneous SCCs overexpress p16 unrelated to HR-
HPV.215,216
An algorithmic approach for HR-HPV testing, shown in
Figure 1, efficiently triages SCC metastases of unknown
primary and reduces unnecessary testing. Following the
algorithm, p16 IHC alone is sufficient to determine HR-HPV
tumor status when the metastasis is located in one of the
upper– or mid–jugular chain (level II and III) lymph node
groups and the tumor morphology is nonkeratinizing.9,213,217
The pretest probability of an HR-HPV–positive SCC is very
high in this setting (and therefore p16 IHC is an excellent
test). High-risk HPV–specific testing is required to confirm a
positive p16 IHC test result only when the tumor
morphology is keratinizing and/or the metastasis is located
outside of the upper or mid jugular chain (the latter would
apply to the setting of nonroutine HPV testing). Confirma-
tory HR-HPV–specific testing should also be performed if
the specific involved lymph node group cannot be deter-
mined, regardless of tumor morphology. If the p16 IHC is
negative, no further HR-HPV testing is indicated, and the
tumor is considered HPV negative because a p16-negative
result essentially excludes a transcriptionally active HR-
HPV–positive SCC.44,146,147
The ability to recognize keratinizing versus nonkeratiniz-
ing tumor morphology is important in order to apply the
above HR-HPV testing algorithm. Nonkeratinizing SCC
resembles transitional epithelium.9,217 The tumor cells have
oval to spindled nuclei, high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios,
and indistinct cell borders, often forming broad, pushing,
ribbonlike nests. Limited keratinization may be present and
does not mean that the tumor is keratinizing type (as long as
the above described histologic features are present). Mitotic
activity is typically brisk, with apoptotic debris and/or
necrosis in the background. When in doubt as to whether
a particular SCC is keratinizing or nonkeratinizing, as may
be the case in small biopsy material, HR-HPV–specific
testing is recommended. However, one should attempt to
histologically classify most SCC metastases. In addition, one
must consider that the morphology of the tumor may
change in posttreatment specimens so that more keratini-
zation may be present.
In the open comment period, there were 145 respondents;
84.14% (n ¼ 122) agreed, and 11.72% (n ¼ 17) disagreed.
There were 21 written comments, with most weighing in on
the method of HR-HPV testing: several comments favored
p16 IHC testing alone in all settings, some were in support
of HR-HPV–specific testing in all cases, and others felt the
method should be at the discretion of the pathologist.
Several pointed out that the location of the lymph node
metastasis (needed to apply the HR-HPV testing algorithm)
is not always known to the pathologist.
Statement 7.—Expert Consensus Opinion.—Pathologists
should perform HR-HPV testing on head and neck FNA
SCC samples from all patients with known oropharyngeal
SCC not previously tested for HR-HPV, with suspected
oropharyngeal SCC, or with metastatic SCC of unknown
primary.
Note: No recommendation is made for or against any
specific testing methodology for HR-HPV testing in FNA
samples. If the result of HR-HPV testing on the FNA sample
is negative, testing should be performed on tissue if it
becomes available. If pathologists use cytology samples for
p16 IHC testing, they should validate the criteria (ie, cutoff)
for a positive result.
The strength of evidence is adequate.

 of these studies210,224–227 were reported only in abstract form
and did not undergo quality assurance. Of the 11 studies
assessed, all were retrospective cohort designs, with the
exception of 1 cross-sectional study.222 All included studies
had prospective data collection, 2 reported blinding of
outcome assessors,222,230 and only 1 reported funding from
industry.230 Ultimately, 4 studies219,222,229,230 were deemed to
have a low to moderate risk of bias, 6 moderate,‡‡ and 1
high,228 although this study did not have methodologic
flaws that would raise concerns about its findings. See
Supplemental Table 6 in the supplemental digital content
for the quality assessment results for all studies included in
the statement 7 evidentiary base.
Among patients with HPV-positive OPSCC, approxi-
mately 85% develop lymph node metastases, and approx-
imately 50% of these patients are first diagnosed based upon
an enlarged cervical lymph node.11,53,55,231–233 Fine-needle
aspiration is frequently used to sample and diagnose
metastatic head and neck carcinomas in cervical lymph
nodes. Because of the marked tendency for HPV-positive
HNSCC to metastasize to cervical lymph nodes, FNA plays
a very important diagnostic role in the initial detection of
these cancers.234–237 In some cases, cytologic material may be
the only tumor specimen available for diagnostic workup,
and in a subset of cases, a primary site of origin will not be
identified even after exhaustive clinical and radiologic
evaluation. The aspirated material obtained by FNA can
be tested by any of a variety of methods for HR-HPV and
used to classify the metastatic HNSCC as HPV positive or
HPV negative, thus indicating an oropharynx origin.
The systematic review identified a limited number of
studies that used samples obtained by FNA for analysis of
HR-HPV status of metastatic HNSCC. The range of
cytologic studies includes HPV determination using forma-
lin-fixed, paraffin-embedded FNA material in a cell block;
liquid-based specimens (Surepath, Becton, Dickinson and
Company, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, and ThinPrep,
Hologic, Marlborough, Massachusetts); and scrapes from
air-dried or alcohol-fixed smears. Testing methodologies
evaluated included p16 IHC,222,229,230,238 DNA ISH,239 cobas
HPV test (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc, Pleasanton,
California),26,228 Cervista HPV HR and Cervista HPV16/18
assays (Hologic),220,240,241 and Hybrid-Capture 2 assay
(Qiagen, Germantown, Maryland).219,224,242 The literature
supports the use of FNA as a valid method for obtaining
material for HR-HPV testing.218,221,223 Sensitivities and
specificities of HPV assays for detecting HR-HPV in FNA
samples are reported to be greater than 90%; however, there
are limited data about the accuracy of any one particular
HPV testing method.§§
A particular difficulty in the assessment of HR-HPV in
FNA samples pertains to the interpretation of p16 immu-
noreactivity in cell block specimens. Although use of the
standard criterion of more than 70% positive cells is
accepted when applied to tissue biopsy, 3 recent studies
suggest that thresholds as low as 10% to 15% for the
percentage of positive cells may be valid for cell
blocks.23,229,230 Whichever method is selected to assess the
HR-HPV status of an FNA sample, individual laboratory
validation is required. Because of the limited data available
pertaining to HR-HPV testing in FNA specimens at the
current time, HR-HPV testing is recommended on any
subsequent tissue specimens that may become available if
HR-HPV testing was negative in the FNA specimen.
In the open comment period there were 142 respondents;
84.51% (n ¼ 120) agreed, and 13.38% (n ¼ 19) disagreed.
There were 16 written comments, including a number that
suggested that either p16 IHC or liquid-based testing
methodologies be used. Others commented that confirma-
tory testing should be performed for FNA samples testing
positive by p16 IHC, particularly in cases where the patient
is known to have a nonoropharyngeal HNSCC.
Refer to Tables 9 and 10 for the summaries of laboratory
data and clinical outcomes for studies where FNAs were
used.
Statement 8.—Expert Consensus Opinion.—Pathologists
should report p16 IHC positivity as a surrogate for HR-HPV
in tissue specimens (ie, noncytology) when there is at least
70% nuclear and cytoplasmic expression with at least
moderate to strong intensity.
The strength of evidence is insufficient.
p16 is a tumor suppressor protein that inhibits CDK4 and
CDK6–dependent/cyclin D–mediated phosphorylation of
RB required for cell proliferation.243 Overexpression of p16

 is an established surrogate marker for transcriptionally
active HR-HPV infection.139,140,243,244
The criteria for p16 IHC have been established in multiple
retrospective and prospective studies that validated the
association of p16 immunopositivity with a more favorable
prognosis in OPSCCs compared with p16-negative carci-
nomas.11,35,81,245 It is important to note that staining must be
both nuclear and cytoplasmic to be considered positive.
Definitions for what percentage of positive cells is necessary
have varied substantially; however, some of the largest and
prospective studies, such as Ang et al,11 have supported a
stringent cutoff of 70% to 75%. However, in high-incidence
countries such as the United States, lesser staining cutoffs
may function similarly. With these criteria, the sensitivity of
p16 IHC for transcriptionally active HR-HPV approaches
100%. The specificity of p16 IHC in the oropharynx is lower
(~85%–95%) for transcriptionally active HR-HPV, in part
because of p16 expression unrelated to HPV.53,81,246 The
interrater agreement among pathologists for p16 IHC
interpretation is excellent (j ¼ 0.95–0.98).53
Rare tissue specimens may exhibit an equivocal pattern of
p16 staining that fails to meet the recommended threshold
for positivity. For instance, cases can exhibit more than 50%
and less than 70% moderate to strong nuclear and
cytoplasmic staining or diffuse low-intensity nuclear and
cytoplasmic staining. Limited evidence suggests a subset of
these cases may have transcriptionally active HR-HPV.53,247

HPV Testing Head & Neck Carcinomas: CAP Guideline—Lewis et al
 In these situations, an HPV-specific test can be performed at
the discretion of the pathologist.
The specificity of p16 IHC outside of the oropharynx is not
as well characterized but is lower, in part because of entities
that can mimic p16/HPV–positive metastatic OPSCC. For
instance, p16 IHC is positive (using the above high
expression cutoff) in as many as 20% to 30% of cutaneous
head and neck SCCs, which are unrelated to HPV and have
no association with clinical outcomes.216 Approximately
40% of lymphoepithelial cysts are p16 immunopositive
within the epithelial lining, although the staining is typically
patchy and involves less than 50% of the epithelium.248
In the open comment period there were 140 respondents;
90.00% (n ¼ 126) agreed and 4.29% (n ¼ 6) disagreed with
statement 8. There were 22 written comments, including
comments that the data supporting the 70% threshold
should be referenced. Several comments suggested there
should be a description of equivocal patterns of p16 staining
that do not meet the threshold for positivity. There was a
comment that p16, as a surrogate marker for HPV, can be
positive in non–HPV-related tumors. Lastly, there were
comments that p16 IHC should be standardized to include
the antibody clone used.
Statement 9.—Expert Consensus Opinion.—Pathologists
should not routinely perform low-risk HPV testing on
patients with head and neck carcinomas.
The strength of evidence is insufficient.
There is persistent confusion about whether low-risk HPV
types (6 and 11) should be tested in HNSCCs, as indicated
by published studies from reference laboratories that
indicate that this testing is frequently requested.249 Low-
risk types of HPV are biologically distinct from high-risk
types, largely because of different binding and signaling
properties of their respective E6 and E7 proteins.250–253

 Although low-risk HPV types are an established etiologic
agent in benign squamous papillomas and warts of various
sites, they do not play a significant role in the development
of HPV-positive OPSCC.253
Because there is little (if any) benefit of identifying low-
risk HPV types in the head and neck, the EP determined
that there is no role for routine low-risk HPV in this context.
Although the systematic review did not specifically address
low-risk HPV types, the expert consensus opinion is that
low-risk testing should not be routinely performed.
In the open comment period, there were 140 respondents;
95.71% (n¼134) agreed, and 4.29% (n¼6) disagreed. There
were 7 written comments, 2 of which focused on a belief
that low-risk HPV can lead to dysplasia. The published
literature does not support this association. One comment
suggested that low-risk HPV testing should be done in
patients with HIV; however, there is no evidence that low-
risk HPV results in carcinoma in HIV-positive patients.
Statement 10.—Expert Consensus Opinion.—Pathologists
should not repeat HPV testing on patients with locally
recurrent, regionally recurrent, or persistent tumor if
primary tumor HR-HPV status has already been established.
If initial HR-HPV status was never assessed or results are
unknown, testing is recommended. Testing for HPV may be
performed on a case-by-case basis for diagnostic purposes if
there is uncertainty regarding whether the tumor in
question is a recurrence or a new primary SCC.
The strength of evidence is insufficient.
High-risk HPV status established on the primary tumor is
the basis for its prognostic value. Recurrences are readily
testable and have been demonstrated to show the same HR-
HPV status.254 As such, there is no documented value of
repeating testing for HR-HPV on locoregionally recurrent or
persistent HNSCC. However, because of this consistency of
phenotype, HR-HPV testing on a recurrence when the
status of the primary OPSCC is unknown would accurately

HPV Testing Head & Neck Carcinomas: CAP Guideline—Lewis et al
 reflect the HPV status and is thus recommended. Particu-
larly with delayed recurrences, a logical clinical question that
may arise is the possibility of a new primary tumor. Such
scenarios require correlation with clinical and morphologic
features, and HPV status may be informative in separating a
recurrence from a new primary SCC.
Our systematic review yielded limited data addressing the
level of concordance between the HPV status of the primary
tumor and the corresponding recurrence. In one study,254 16
locoregional recurrences and 21 metastases were tested
along with their untreated primaries. Thirty-six of 37 cases
(97%) demonstrated a concordant HPV status. For the 1
discordant case, a second primary was not entirely excluded.
However, the study also suggests that technical variability in
testing may affect findings in a recurrent site.
In the open comment period there were 94 respondents;
92.47% (n ¼ 86) agreed, and 7.53% (n ¼ 7) disagreed. There
were 8 comments, most notably the suggestion to indicate
that HPV testing may help separate true recurrence from a
separate primary tumor. Concern about technical differenc-
es among laboratories affecting repeat testing was raised, as
well as a concern about treatment effect.
Statement 11.—Expert Consensus Opinion.—Pathologists
should not routinely perform HR-HPV testing on patients
with distant metastases if primary tumor HR-HPV status
has been established. Testing for HPV may be performed on
a case-by-case basis for diagnostic purposes if there is
uncertainty regarding whether the tumor in question is a
metastasis or a new primary SCC.
The strength of evidence is insufficient.
High-risk HPV status established on the primary tumor is
the basis for its prognostic value. Distant metastases are
readily testable and limited data show that they retain the
same HR-HPV status, including p16 overexpression.137,254,255
As such, there is no documented value of repeating testing
on a metastatic tumor. However, because of this consistency
of phenotype, HR-HPV testing on a metastasis when the
status of the primary is unknown would accurately reflect
the HPV status of the primary HNSCC and is thus
recommended. In some cases, however, there is the
possibility that the metastasis represents a new primary
SCC. Such scenarios require correlation with clinical and
morphologic features, and HPV status may be informative in
separating a distant metastasis from a new primary SCC.
Our systematic review yielded limited data addressing the
level of concordance between the HPV status of primary
tumor and corresponding distant metastasis. Collectively,
concordance is noted in about 44 of 45 (97.7%) tested paired
primary tumors and metastases in the literature.137,254,255 In
one study,137 20 of 20 tested metastases demonstrated
concordant HPV status as compared with their primaries. In
another study,254 16 locoregional recurrences and 21 distant
metastases were tested along with their untreated primaries.
Thirty-six of 37 cases (97%) demonstrated concordant HPV
status. For the 1 discordant case, a second primary was not
entirely excluded. One small series of 4 patients outside of
our systematic review confirmed concordance in HPV status
between 4 primary and metastatic SCCs.255
However, as with recurrences, technical variability in
testing may affect findings in a metastatic site,254 and the
findings are insufficient to recommend a specific testing
algorithm at recurrent sites. Particularly with possible lung
metastases, an approach that includes HPV-specific testing
for p16-positive tumors should be considered, because of
p16 expression in a subset of lung SCCs not associated with
HR-HPV.
In the open comment period there were 90 respondents;
95.56% (n ¼ 86) agreed, and 4.44% (n ¼ 4) disagreed. There
were 7 comments, most notably echoing the statement that
HPV testing may help separate true recurrence from a
separate primary tumor. Concern about p16 IHC testing as a
stand-alone test in this context was raised, as well as
concern about the effect of tumor heterogeneity.
Statement 12.—Expert Consensus Opinion.—Pathologists
should report primary OPSCCs that test positive for HR-
HPV or its surrogate marker p16 as HPV positive and/or p16
positive.
The strength of evidence is insufficient.
Oropharyngeal SCC with transcriptionally active HR-HPV
is a distinct subtype of head and neck cancer. Because HPV
defines this subtype, the HR-HPV status (by HPV-specific
and/or surrogate marker p16 testing) should be included in
the pathologic diagnosis. In the literature, a number of
different terms have been used to describe the HPV status of

 these tumors, including HPV positive, HPV related, HPV
driven, HPV mediated, and p16 positive.12,55,148,256 The above
expert consensus opinion is consistent with the terminology
used in contemporary classifications of OPSCCs.
The term HPV positive refers to OPSCCs with detectable
virus by HPV-specific methods in a tumor that is already
established to be p16 positive, referring thus to transcrip-
tionally active HPV. It can also be used to describe tumors
that are just positive for p16 by IHC. Although p16 IHC is a
surrogate marker for HR-HPV, a positive result in the
appropriate clinical and pathologic context is sufficient to
classify a tumor as HPV positive for risk stratification.55 If the
term p16 positive is used in clinical reporting on its own, a
comment should be added that describes the strong
relationship between p16 immunopositivity and HPV in
the respective setting. For tumors that are positive for p16 by
IHC with or without accompanying HPV-specific testing,
both HPV positive and p16 positive can be used for
reporting (ie, HPV-positive or p16-positive OPSCC).
The World Health Organization (WHO) also recommends
the term SCC, HPV positive for patients who are either p16
positive (when it is the only test performed) or p16 plus
HPV-specific test positive. The new Union for International
Cancer Control257 and AJCC staging systems14 prefer a
hybrid term, HPV-mediated (p16þ) oropharyngeal cancer. The
panel considers these synonymous.
The above terminology should be used at the time of
diagnosis, if possible. Delays in the reporting of HPV status
should be avoided, as the HPV status of OPSCCs defines the
tumor subtype, predicts prognosis, and may affect thera-
peutic decisions. Given the widespread availability and rapid
turnaround time of p16 IHC, the HPV status of OPSCC
should be rapidly available in the majority of cases.243
In the open comment period there were 136 respondents;
92.65% (n¼126) agreed, and 5.15% (n¼7) disagreed. There
were 22 written comments. There were several comments
that HPV positive and p16 positive are not equivalent, in
part because of a small percentage of p16-positive tumors
that are unrelated to HPV. Others commented that
reporting terminology needs to explicitly describe the HPV
status, given that some clinicians may not understand the
relationship between p16 IHC and HPV status. There was a
suggestion to avoid the term HPV positive because of the
stigma of sexually transmitted diseases. Lastly, there was a
suggestion to use the terminology approved by the WHO
Classification of Head and Neck Tumours,258 which this
guideline agrees with, in accordance with the new 4th
edition.
Statement 13.—Expert Consensus Opinion.—Pathologists
should not provide a tumor grade or differentiation status for
HPV-positive/p16-positive OPSCC.
The strength of evidence is insufficient.
Tumor grade is a measurement of differentiation, that is,
how closely a tumor resembles the normal tissue from
which it presumably arises. Tumor grade generally corre-
lates with biologic behavior, so that well-differentiated
tumors typically behave less aggressively than poorly
differentiated tumors. For SCCs, highly keratinizing tumors
with keratin pearl formation and small nuclei are considered
well differentiated. Most HPV-positive OPSCCs have a
characteristic morphologic appearance. As they are usually
nonkeratinizing, with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio sand
hyperchromatic nuclei, and are arranged in lobules and
sheets, they have often been classified as poorly differen-
tiated or high-grade carcinomas. However, these classifiers
were developed in head and neck SCC in general and not
specifically for HPV-positive OPSCC. In these tumors, this
morphology does not predict poor outcomes, but rather is
paradoxically associated with a better prognosis in a
majority of cases because it predicts HPV positivity.2,55,90
Human papillomavirus–positive/p16-positive OPSCCs
arise from the tonsillar crypts rather than the surface
epithelium. The tonsillar crypts are lined by a specialized
reticulated epithelium with an associated lymphocytic
infiltrate. Deep in the normal crypts, this epithelium has
basaloid cytologic features, absent keratinization, high
nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, and permeating lymphocytes.
Westra161 has proposed that HPV-positive oropharyngeal
SCCs might best be considered as well-differentiated
carcinomas given their resemblance to the nonneoplastic
reticulated crypt lining epithelium.
In the open comment period there were 136 respondents;
57.35% (n ¼ 78) agreed, and 36.03% (n ¼ 49) disagreed,
making this the recommendation with the lowest agreement
rate. There were 26 written comments. Eight comments were
acknowledgment of the respondents’ lack of expertise to
answer the question. Thirteen respondents stated that
grading should be performed. Some of these 13 felt that
tumor grade and differentiation might assist in staging and
future therapy. Some saw ‘‘no harm’’ in providing tumor
grade even if it did not correlate with clinical behavior. Some
of the respondents confused tumor grade and staging.
Several respondents pointed out that the CAP protocol for
the examination of specimens from patients with carcinomas
of the pharynx259 and the 7th edition of the AJCC staging
manual260 require histologic grading on all head and neck
cancers. The concerns regarding AJCC 7th edition will be less
relevant as the 8th edition of the AJCC staging manual14
comes into clinical use by early 2018, and familiarity with the
4th edition of the WHO Classification of Head and Neck
Tumours258 grows. The latter states that grading is not
applicable for HPV-positive OPSCC. In addition, some
pointed out the practical complication that one might not
know what the p16 status was before signing out a case, and
that one would have to provide tumor grade in an addendum
if the tumor turned out to be p16 negative.
Statement 14.—Expert Consensus Opinion.—Pathologists
should not alter HR-HPV testing strategy based on patient
smoking history.
The strength of evidence is insufficient.
Patients with HPV-positive OPSCC often have improved
disease-free and overall survival when compared with those
with HPV-negative OPSCC. The strong historical associa-
tion of OPSCC with tobacco and alcohol use has led to the
examination of these and other potential prognostic factors
to further risk stratify HPV-positive OPSCC to allow the
identification of patients who might benefit from treatment
deintensification and subsequent reduction in short- and
long-term side effects without compromising overall sur-
vival. The initial observation that tobacco use significantly
decreased the improved survival seen in HPV-positive
OPSCC resulted from a retrospective analysis of Radiation
Therapy Oncology Group 0129 data using recursive
partition analysis. Although HPV status was the main
predictor of survival, tobacco use as measured by pack-years
increased the risk of death by 1% per year, independent of
OPSCC HPV status.11 The authors concluded that tumor
HPV status and tobacco use (.10 pack-years) were robust
and independent predictors of survival after chemoradiation
therapy. A subsequent retrospective analysis based on the
32
Arch Pathol Lab Med
HPV Testing Head & Neck Carcinomas: CAP Guideline—Lewis et al
 subset of OPSCC patients from Radiation Therapy Oncol-
ogy Groups 9003 and 0129 confirmed these findings.29
Careful and exhaustive quantitation of tobacco exposure in
this analysis demonstrated that the risk of death increased
linearly with tobacco smoking as measured by pack-years in
HPV-related OPSCC. The increased rate of locoregional
failure seen in this cohort suggests a likely direct effect of
tobacco use on treatment effectiveness, rather than from
competing causes of mortality commonly seen in smokers.
Since these initial studies, a number of additional analyses
based on recursive partitioning analysis have validated
tobacco use as an important variable in treatment response
in HPV-positive OPSCC.70,261 There is also no published
evidence that smoking changes the results of any of the
HPV-specific tests or p16 IHC. Consequently, the EP does
not recommend altering the HR-HPV testing strategy based
on smoking history. Rather, tobacco use, as measured by
pack-years, is one of several variables, along with HR-HPV
status, that the treating physician will use when counseling
patients regarding likely treatment outcomes and potentially
when selecting therapy in the context of a clinical trial.
In the open comment period there were 134 respondents;
97.76% (n ¼ 131) agreed, and 1.49% (n ¼ 2) disagreed. Of all
the recommendations, this one had the highest agreement
rate. There were only 8 written comments. Two respondents
commented that the smoking history was irrelevant, one
respondent expressed concern regarding pathology access
to the smoking history, and another expressed concern
about the lack of standards in reporting a smoking history.
One respondent agreed that HPV and smoking may coexist,
and another stressed smoking does not rule out HPV
infection. One respondent suggested performing HPV
testing in non-OPSCC in the absence of a smoking history
and limited keratinization.
CONCLUSIONS
The
emergence
of
HPV-positive
OPSCC,
which
is
biologically and clinically a unique type of HNSCC, has
made it critical that such patients be identified by routine
testing for HR-HPV in clinical practice. Knowledge of the
HPV tumor status is important for patient prognosis and for
the establishment of specific treatments better matched to
such tumors. This EP, through a rigorous systematic review,
has provided 14 formal recommendations or expert con-
sensus opinions on the nature of HPV testing in various
head and neck specimens, scenarios, and settings, with the
goal of standardizing what is performed across diverse
pathology practice settings. These recommendations will be
expected to evolve with future research, literature updates,
and reviews in the coming years.
