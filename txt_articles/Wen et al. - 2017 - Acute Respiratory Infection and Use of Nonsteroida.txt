Background. Previous studies have suggested that acute respiratory infection (ARI) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) use could trigger acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In some countries, physicians prescribe NSAIDs for patients with 
ARI for symptom relief. However, there is no research evaluating whether NSAIDs use during ARI episodes may increase the risk 
of AMI.
Methods. We identified 9793 patients with an incident hospitalization of AMI (index date) between 2007 and 2011. Using 
case-crossover design, we compared the following exposure status between the case (1–7-day before index date) and matched con-
trol period (366–372-day before index date): NSAIDs use during ARI episodes, ARI episodes without NSAIDs use, NSAIDs use 
only, or no exposure. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios adjusted for potential 
confounders.
Results. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use during ARI was associated with a 3.4-fold increased risk of AMI (adjusted 
odds ratio [aOR] = 3.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.80–4.16), ARI without NSAIDs use was associated with a 2.7-fold increased 
risk (aOR = 2.65; 95% CI = 2.29–3.06), and NSAIDs use only was associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk (aOR = 1.47; 95% CI = 
1.33–1.62). Moreover, parenteral NSAIDs were associated with much higher risk in ARI patients (aOR = 7.22; 95% CI = 4.07–12.81).
Conclusions. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use during ARI episodes, especially parenteral NSAIDs, was associated 
with a further increased risk of AMI.

Recent evidence has suggested that acute respiratory infection 
(ARI) is associated with an increased risk of acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI), and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) 
is reported to be 2–5-fold greater during the 1st through 7th 
days of either nonspecified respiratory infection or presumed 
influenza infection [1–3]. A recent meta-analysis also showed 
that influenza-like illness (odds ratio [OR] = 2.29; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI] = 1.11–4.73) and respiratory tract infection 
(OR = 1.89; 95% CI 1.35–2.65) were highly associated with 
 
AMI [4].
In clinical practice, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) have been widely used for pain and fever associated 
with ARI or the common cold in some countries [5]. However, 
the association of NSAIDs use and the risk of AMI has been 
reported in many observational studies and clinical trials [6–
11]. Existing evidence suggests that not only cyclooxygenase 
2 (COX-2) inhibitors but also some nonselective NSAIDs can 
increase the risk of AMI [12–15]. On 9 July 2015, the US Food 
and Drug Administration (US FDA) further strengthened its 
existing label warning that NSAIDs can cause heart attacks, 
which highlights the need to be alert for cardiovascular adverse 
events during NSAIDs treatment [16]. In the same year, the 
Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) also issued a warning of 
increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients taking high-
dose ibuprofen, with a risk similar to that of COX-2 inhibitors 
and diclofenac [17].
Because ARI and NSAIDs, individually, are both associated 
with an increased risk of AMI, it is highly possible that NSAIDs 
use during ARI episodes, which is common in daily practice, 
might have a joint effect on the risk of AMI and put patients in 
a more dangerous situation. However, to the best of our knowl-
edge, no study has ever evaluated this hypothesis. The aim of

this case-crossover study was therefore to assess the potential 
joint effect of ARI and NSAIDs use on the risk of AMI using 
the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in 
Taiwan.
METHODS
Data Source
The data we used in this study were from the NHIRD, which 
contains outpatient and inpatient claims, including demo-
graphic characteristics, disease diagnoses, and prescription 
medication records for all beneficiaries enrolled in Taiwan’s 
mandatory National Health Insurance (NHI) program [18]. 
All of the claims data for approximately 23 million beneficia-
ries (approximately 99% of the total population in Taiwan) 
during the period of 1 January 2005–31 December 2011 were 
used as the data source. The study protocol was approved by 
the Research Ethics Committee of National Taiwan University 
Hospital (NTUH-REC-201406124W).
Study Subjects
Eligible study subjects included patients aged ≥20 years who 
had an incident hospitalization for AMI, defined by an admis-
sion record with a principal diagnosis of AMI [International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
(ICD-9-CM code) 410.xx] between 1 January 2007 and 31 
December 2011. The positive predictive value for identifying 
AMI cases using the principal diagnosis code (ICD-9-CM code 
410) has been reported to be 93% in the NHIRD [19]. We defined 
the index date for each patient as the date of incident hospital-
ization for AMI. Patients with any outpatient visit or hospital-
ization for AMI or old myocardial infarction (ICD-9-CM code 
412) during the 730 days prior to the index date were excluded 
to guarantee the enrollment of incident AMI cases in our study. 
To be eligible for the study, patients also needed to have full NHI 
coverage for a continuous period of at least 24 months (730 days) 
prior to the index date to enable the evaluation of patient history. 
We thus excluded patients without any clinical visit (including 
outpatient or emergency room visit) during the 730 days prior to 
the index date. Patients who were admitted for any reason during 
the 730 days prior to the index date were also excluded because 
of the uncertainty about the dosage and duration of NSAIDs use 
during the hospitalization in Taiwan.
Study Design
We used a case-crossover design to investigate the potential 
joint effect of ARI and use of NSAIDs on the risk of AMI. 
With the same patients as self-controls, the study could avoid 
the between-subject differences of measured or unmeasured 
time-invariant confounders, such as family history or lifestyle 
factors [20]. We compared the exposure status of individual 
study subjects between the case period (1–7-day period before 
the index date) and matched control period (366–372-day 
period before the index date). To prevent the impact of seasonal 
effects on the association between ARI and AMI, the control 
period was defined to be the equivalent time period exactly 
1 year (365 days) prior in our study.
Exposure to Acute Respiratory Infection and Nonsteroidal 
Anti-inflammatory Drugs
An ARI episode was defined as an outpatient visit for ARI 
(ICD-9-CM code 079.9, 382.9, 460, 461.9, 465.8, 465.9, 466.0, 
486, 487.0, 487.1, 487.8, 490, 780.6, or 786.2) during the case or 
control period. The correlation coefficient between these diag-
nosis codes and positive respiratory virus pathogens has been 
reported to be 0.71 [21]. The day of the outpatient visit for an 
ARI was considered the first day of infection, and for partici-
pants with >1 outpatient visit for an ARI in the case or control 
period, all visits were considered as a single exposure during the 
period of interest.
Exposure to NSAIDs within the case or control period for 
the same patient was also assessed to explore the joint effect 
of ARI and NSAIDs on AMI. The NSAIDs investigated in 
this study were single-active-ingredient NSAIDs (Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] code M01A, except for glucos-
amine [M01AX05]). Dispensing information of either paren-
teral or nonparenteral (including oral and rectal) NSAIDs in 
NHIRD were used in this study. Cumulative exposure to NSAIDs 
within the case or control period was calculated as defined 
daily dose, which is defined by the World Health Organization 
Collaborating Center for Drug Statistics Methodology [22]. The 
defined daily dose and ATC code of NSAIDs studied are listed 
in Supplementary Table 1. A high-dose of NSAIDs was defined 
as a cumulative dose higher than or equal to the 75th percentile 
of the cumulative dose of our study subjects in the study.
According to the definitions of exposure to ARI and NSAIDs, 
we categorized the exposure status in either case or control peri-
ods as follows: NSAIDs use during ARI episodes, ARI episodes 
without NSAIDs use, NSAIDs use only, or no exposure.
Baseline Characteristics of Study Subjects
We collected data on age, sex, comorbidities, and concomitant 
medications during the 1–90-day period and 366–455-day 
period before the index date for each subject. A detailed list 
of comorbidities and concomitant medications is presented in 
Supplementary Table 2.
Statistical Analysis
Multivariable conditional logistic regressions were used to 
estimate the effect of ARI and NSAIDs use on the risk of AMI. 
We used the LOGISTIC procedure of SAS software) to cal-
culate the crude odds ratios (cORs) and adjusted odds ratios 
(aORs) with 95% confidence intervals. The discordant con-
comitant medications between the case and control periods 
were considered to be within-subject time-variant covariates

for adjusted analysis, including calcium channel blockers, 
agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, beta-blockers, 
diuretics, anti-hypertensive agents, low-dose aspirin, nonaspi-
rin antiplatelet agents, statins, insulin, and acetaminophen. 
A preplanned secondary analysis was conducted to investi-
gate the effects of routes of administration (ie, parenteral or 
nonparenteral) and cumulative dose of NSAIDs on the risk 
of AMI.
Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robust-
ness of the results by varying the time window of exposure from 
7 days (case = days 1–7; control = days 366–372) to 14 days 
(case = days 1–14; controls = days 366–379) and 30 days (case 
= days 1–30; controls = days 366–395) without changing the 
definition of the index date.
RESULTS
We identified 9793 patients with an incident admission for 
AMI between 2007 and 2011 who fulfilled all eligibility cri-
teria (Figure 1). Among the patients, 61.35% were male, and 
the mean age at the index date was 72.29 years old (standard 
deviation [SD] = 12.65). Their comorbidities and concomitant 
medications in the case and control periods are summarized 
in Table 1. Diabetes mellitus was the most frequent comor-
bidity (42.59% in the case period and 40.71% in the control 
period), followed by hypertension (41.68% in the case period 
and 39.93% in the control period). Calcium channel blocker 
was the most frequent comedication (50.07% in the case period 
and 47.84% in the control period), followed by agents acting 
on the renin-angiotensin system (49.88% in the case period 
and 46.66% in the control period). Compared with the control 
period, a higher proportion of subjects had comorbidities and 
comedications in the case period.
Table 2 shows that NSAIDs use during ARI episodes was 
associated with a 3.4-fold increased risk of AMI (aOR = 3.41; 
95% CI = 2.80–4.16) after adjusting for discordant concomitant 
medications between the case period and control period. ARI 
episodes without NSAIDs use or NSAIDs use only were asso-
ciated with a 2.7-fold (aOR = 2.65; 95% CI = 2.29–3.06) or 1.5-
fold (aOR = 1.47; 95% CI = 1.33–1.62) increased risk of AMI, 
respectively.
Parenteral NSAIDs use during ARI episodes was associated 
with the highest risk of AMI (aOR = 7.22; 95% CI = 4.07–12.81). 
High-dose nonparenteral NSAIDs use during ARI episodes was 
associated with a 3.3-fold increased risk of AMI (aOR = 3.32; 
95% CI = 2.34–4.93). Even low-dose nonparenteral NSAIDs 
use during ARI episodes was associated with an approximately 
3-fold increased risk of AMI (aOR = 2.95; 95% CI = 2.31–3.75) 
(Table 3). Sensitivity analyses by varying the length of the expo-
sure time window yielded similar results (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
Our findings support our hypothesis that having 2 risk factors 
for AMI (ie, ARI and NSAIDs) would further increase the AMI 
risk compared with having only 1 risk factor for AMI (ie, ARI 
only or NSAIDs only). To the best of our knowledge, this study 
is the first to investigate the joint effect of ARI and NSAIDs use 
on the risk of AMI. This approach should raise clinical concern 
because NSAIDs use during ARI episodes is highly common in 
real-world practice. For example, a previous study showed that 
the most frequent diagnosis for NSAID prescriptions is acute 
nasopharyngitis (ICD-9-CM code 460) [23]. Instead of treating 
respiratory infection as a confounding factor as in some pre-
vious studies that focused on the association between NSAIDs 
use and the risk of cardiovascular disease [17, 18], our study 
identified ARI as an individual exposure to reveal the joint 
effect of ARI and NSAIDs use on the risk of AMI.
The mechanism behind the potential joint effect of ARI and 
NSAIDs could be explained by existing evidence. Several studies 
found that infection induces the biosynthesis of proinflamma-
tory and prothrombotic cytokines and increases the accumu-
lation of macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions [24, 25]. In 
addition, ARI induces systemic inflammation and coagulation, 
leading to thrombosis [26, 27]. Although NSAIDs are thought to 
have an anti-inflammatory effect, inhibition of cyclooxygenase 
would decrease the level of antithrombotic prostaglandin I2 and 
enhance the synthesis of leukotrienes, leading to platelet aggre-
gation and vasoconstriction. Furthermore, NSAIDs can cause 
elevation of blood pressure by sodium and water retention and

lead to plaque rupture [28, 29]. Therefore, NSAIDs use during 
an ARI would increase the occurrence of AMI mechanistically.
Our findings concerning ARI only or NSAIDs only and the 
risk of AMI are similar to those of previous studies. Previously, 
database research in the United Kingdom using case-crossover 
analysis showed a relative risk of 2.7 (95% CI = 1.6–4.7) for AMI 
related to ARI in the 10 days before the index date [30], which 
was quite similar to the risk associated with ARI only (aOR = 
2.65; 95% CI = 2.29–3.06) in our study, although the length of 
time window was somewhat different. The risk associated with 
NSAIDs only in our study (aOR = 1.47; 95% CI = 1.33–1.62) 
was also similar to that of a previous case-crossover study in 
Taiwan, which found that oral NSAIDs were associated with 
a 1.42-fold increased risk of AMI (95% CI = 1.29–1.56) [23]. 
These similarities makes it more convincing that NSAIDs use 
during ARI episodes would further increase the risk of AMI.

 Acute Respiratory Infection and NSAIDs on Risk of AMI • JID 2017:215 (15 February) • 507
Statistically, there was a negative multiplicative interaction 
between ARI and NSAIDs (the 2 risk factors of AMI) because 
the observed joint adjusted odds ratio was less than the expected 
value based on independent adjusted odds ratios [31, 32]. A 
possible explanation was that NSAIDs have an anti-inflamma-
tory effect that attenuates the increased risk of AMI associated 
with ARI. However, the magnitude of the risk of AMI associ-
ated with NSAIDs use during ARI episodes was still higher than 
the independent effects of ARI or NSAIDs on the risk of AMI, 
indicating that NSAIDs might trigger AMI through a different 
mechanism.
Our study also suggested that the risk of AMI in patients 
using parenteral NSAIDs was higher than that observed in 
patients using nonparenteral NSAIDs, which is consistent with 
previous studies [23, 33]. For example, a study that also had a 
case-crossover study design found that the risk of AMI was 3.4-
fold higher in patients using parenteral NSAIDs (aOR = 3.35; 
95% CI = 2.50–4.47) [23]. Furthermore, we found that the risk 
of AMI associated with parenteral NSAIDs use during ARI epi-
sodes was even higher. Although ibuprofen was the only par-
enteral NSAIDs approved for fever relief by the US FDA, there 
were several other NSAIDs that are available in parenteral form,

such as ketorolac and diclofenac. Therefore, the safety issue of 
parenteral NSAIDs use during ARI is still noteworthy.
For nonparenteral NSAIDs, we observed that during ARI 
episodes, a high dose of NSAIDs was associated with a higher 
risk of AMI than a low-dose of NSAIDs. This result was consis-
tent with previous studies showing that high-dose NSAIDs use 
was associated with a greater risk of AMI than low-dose use [23, 
33]. In our study, however, without considering ARI, high-dose 
NSAIDs use was not highly associated with a higher risk of AMI 
than low-dose NSAIDs. A possible explanation for this is that 
many patients without ARI were prescribed high-dose NSAIDs 
for their underlying diseases, so the exposure status to NSAIDs 
was almost the same in the case and control period, resulting 
in an insignificant association between high-dose NSAIDs use 
and AMI. We examined our data and found that approximately 
40% of those who received high-dose NSAIDs without ARI had 
osteoarthritis (38.26% in the case period and 41.77% in the con-
trol period), which supports our inference.
Similar to other observational studies based on claims databases, 
our study has several limitations. First, some information about the 
study subjects is not assessable from the database. For example, it 
is not easy to perfectly capture the severity of ARI in our study 
because laboratory data are not recorded in the claims data we used. 
However, we have conducted a sensitivity analysis using ARI types 
as a surrogate of ARI severity to estimate the potential confound-
ing by indication. We found that NSAIDs use during influenza-re-
lated ARI episodes was associated with the highest risk of AMI 
(Supplementary Table 3). More epidemiology studies are needed 
to investigate the influence of infection severity on cardiovascu-
lar risk. In addition, we were unable to ascertain that dispensed 
NSAIDs were actually taken by the participants in a claims-based 
study. There might be nondifferential misclassification bias in our 
study because the NHIRD does not have information concerning 
nonprescription drugs use, which might underestimate the associ-
ation between NSAIDs and the risk of AMI.
Second, although we adopted a case-crossover design and 
adjusted for discordant concomitant medications, we were not 
able to control for all confounding factors. However, we yielded 
similar results after further adjusting for discordant comor-
bidities, including cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, con-
gestive heart failure, valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation, 
peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, peptic ulcer dis-
ease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic renal disease, chronic 
liver disease, and cancer (data not shown). Third, our study 
might have protopathic bias because physicians might prescribe 
NSAIDs for certain symptoms before the occurrence of AMI. 
However, our sensitivity analyses by varying the length of the 
exposure time window yielded similar results. We believe that 
the extent of protopathic bias would be minor. Lastly, we did 
not present results regarding the potential different effects of 
different NSAIDs use during ARI on risk of AMI. Nevertheless, 
we have conducted an exploratory analysis to address this issue 
(Supplementary Table 4). We did observe different effects of 
different NSAIDs during ARI on risk of AMI. However, these 
findings should be interpreted with caution due to the relatively 
small sample size and wide confidence interval.
In conclusion, we determined that NSAIDs use during ARI 
episodes, particularly parenteral NSAIDs use, was associated 
with a further increased risk of AMI.
