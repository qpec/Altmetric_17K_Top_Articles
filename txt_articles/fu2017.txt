Aims
We aimed to characterise the effect of expeditious hip fracture surgery in elderly patients 
within 24 hours of admission on short-term post-operative outcomes.
Patients and Methods
Patients age 65 or older that underwent surgery for closed femoral neck and 
intertrochanteric hip fractures were identified from the American College of Surgeons 
National Surgical Quality Improvement Program between 2011 and 2014. Multivariable 
propensity-adjusted logistic regressions were performed to determine associations between 
early surgery within 24 hours and post-operative complications, controlling for selection 
bias in patients undergoing early surgery based on observable characteristics.
Results
A total of 26 051 patients were included in the study; 5921 (22.7%) had surgery within 24 
hours of admission, while 20 130 (77
.3%) patients had surgery after 24 hours. Propensity-
adjusted multivariable logistic regressions demonstrated that surgery within 24 hours was 
independently associated with lower odds of respiratory complications including 
pneumonia, failure to extubate, or reintubation (odds ratio (OR) 0.78, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.67 to 0.90), and extended length of stay (LOS) defined as ≥ 6 days (OR 0.84, 
95% CI 0.78 to 0.90).
Conclusion
In elderly patients with hip fractures, early surgery within 24 hours of admission is 
independently associated with less pulmonary complications including pneumonia, failure 
to extubate, and reintubation, as well as shorter LOS.

In 2000, there were 1.6 million osteoporotic
fractures of the hip worldwide, with approxi-
mately 250 000 occurring in the United States
and 620 000 in Europe.1,2 The overall
incidence of these fractures is predicted to rise
to over six million by 2050. The incidence in
women is expected to decrease and in men to
increase.3-5 Fractures of the hip are associated
with significant morbidity and mortality, with
a reported one-year mortality ranging between
10% and 37%.6-9 They are also associated
with a loss of function, independence, and
increased rates of nursing home care.7-11
Various areas of the management of these
fractures continue to be explored with a view
to improving clinical outcomes. For instance,
the optimal timing of surgery remains contro-
versial. In patients without comorbidities,
surgery within 48 hours of injury has been
associated with decreased mortality, hospital
length of stay (LOS), and self-reported pain
scores.12-14 Shiga et al12 found decreased 30-day
and one-year all-cause mortality in patients
who underwent surgery within 48 hours in a
systematic review of 16 studies which included
257 367 patients.
Surgery in the first 24 hours after admission
has also been shown to be beneficial in patients
who are stable and without significant comor-
bidities. There is a reduced incidence of
avascular necrosis of the femoral head and
nonunion, morbidity and mortality, and of
complications including decubitus ulcers,
urinary tract infections, and deep vein throm-
bosis (DVT).15-25 However, the data about
mortality in this group of patients is conflict-
ing. In a retrospective study of 6638 patients
with a fracture of the hip, Bretherton and
Parker19 found that surgery 12 hours or later
after admission to hospital had a 1.59-times
increased odds of 30-day mortality when com-
pared with surgery within 12 hours of admis-

sion. On the other hand, a prospective study by Orosz et
al20 of 1178 patients with a fracture of the hip found no dif-
ference in the rate of mortality with surgery being under-
taken within 24 hours of admission or later.
The number of studies evaluating surgery undertaken
within 24 hours of admission are fewer than those consid-
ering surgery undertaken within 48 hours of admission or
thereafter, and the clinical outcomes are not as well charac-
terised. The aim of this study was to determine the inde-
pendent associations between surgery undertaken within
24 hours of admission and post-operative complications in
elderly patients with a fracture of the hip and to further
characterise the complications within 30 days post-opera-
tively. We hypothesised that delaying surgery beyond 24
hours is an independent risk factor for the development of
complications.
Patients and Methods
Data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement
Program (NSQIP) between 2011 and 2014 was used for
this study. The NSQIP is a multicentre registry of the out-
comes of surgery maintained by the American College of
Surgeons, with more than 400 participating hospitals
across the United States, ranging from large academic
medical centres to small community hospitals, though not
including Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals.26 Peri-
operative data are collected prospectively by surgical
reviewers from the inpatient notes, direct interviews with
medical providers, and outpatient visits, with all in-hospi-
tal and post-discharge events collected up to the 30th post-
operative day irrespective of the date of discharge. The
quality of the data is frequently audited, with an overall
interobserver rate of disagreement of about 2%.26 Sample
sizes in the NSQIP are limited by its rigorous prospective
data collection methodology, and systematic sampling pro-
cesses are used to minimise sampling bias.26 Compared
with a United States national administrative claims data-
base such as the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS),
which captures 20% of all hospital discharges in the
United States,27 the hip fracture cohorts in NSQIP and NIS
report similar baseline patient variables including demo-
graphics, age, and the type of fracture.28 While having sim-
ilar cohorts, however, comparative studies have shown
that a prospectively-collected registry such as NSQIP has
significant advantages over larger administrative or insur-
ance claims-based databases including the collection of
complications after discharge from hospital, the ability to
calculate the body mass index (BMI) directly from the
height and weight rather than relying on obesity diagnosis
codes, 
and 
the 
direct 
capture 
of 
pre-operative
comorbidities from the medical records rather than from
billing codes.27-30
Study population. Patients aged 65 years and over who
underwent surgery for a closed femoral neck or intertro-
chanteric fracture were identified from the NSQIP. Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)
codes31 820.0, 820.01, 820.02, 820.03, 820.09, 820.20,
820.21, 820.22, and 820.8 were used to screen for these
types of fracture. Those patients who underwent surgery
coded by Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes32
27235 (percutaneous fixation), 27125/27236 (hemiarthro-
plasty), 27130 (total hip arthroplasty (THA)), 27244
(plate/screw fixation), and 27245 (intramedullary implant)
were included. An initial cohort of 32 798 patients was
identified. Those with missing data on gender, age, height,
weight, and those classified as having a contaminated
surgical site were excluded, leaving 29 028 Patients. Finally,
those aged < 65 years were excluded, leaving 26 051 in the
final cohort.

gation and that all investigations were conducted in con-
formity with ethical principles of research.
Variables and outcome measures. Demographic data and
medical histories were recorded from the database. BMI
was calculated directly from the height and weight of the
patients. A modified Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)
was calculated from the comorbidity data available in the
NSQIP.33 This index has been used in previous studies
involving this database, and has been shown to be compa-
rable with the original CCI.34-36 The pre-operative Ameri-
can Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade,37 as well as
any history of anticoagulation, which may be a cause of
surgical delay, was also collected. The endpoints of the
study included any post-operative complication, septic
complications (sepsis or septic shock), wound complica-
tions (dehiscence, deep infection, superficial infection, or
organ space infection), cardiac complications (cardiac
arrest or myocardial infarction), respiratory complications
(intubation, ventilator requirement, or pneumonia),
urinary complications (urinary tract infection), blood
transfusions, return to the operating theatre, death, re-
admission, renal complications (renal failure), or DVT or
pulmonary embolism (PE). Extended LOS was defined as
more than six days, or about 25% of the study cohort.
Statistical analysis. Due to the possibility of significant
confounding factors in comparing patients that underwent
early (< 24 hours) versus non-early (> 24 hours) surgery,
baseline characteristics including a history of chronic anti-
coagulation 
were 
compared 
between 
the 
groups.
Propensity score adjustment was used to control for these
potential confounders. The propensity score was defined as
the conditional probability of a patient undergoing surgery
within 24 hours, based on the demographic information,
the presence or absence of obesity, the modified CCI, the
ASA grade and a history of anticoagulation. Propensity-
adjusted p-values were calculated for these pre-operative
characteristics, showing successful control of potential
selection bias, as all statistically significant differences in
these variables were eliminated with propensity adjustment
(all p-values > 0.05). Similar methodology has been used in
previous studies using the NSQIP.35,36,38 The same

propensity scores were carried forward into subsequent
multivariable analyses.
The prevalence of various comorbidities was compared
between the early and non-early surgical groups in bivariate
fashion, using chi-squared tests for all categorical variables.
Endpoints were compared between the groups in bivariate
analyses. The Bonferroni correction was used to determine
the level of significance due to multiple comparisons.
Propensity-adjusted multivariable logistic regression analy-
sis was performed to determine the independent effect of
early surgery on the outcomes. Regressions were adjusted
for gender, age, BMI, modified CCI and a history of antico-
agulation. For post-operative complications that were
decreased in the early surgery cohort, additional
propensity-adjusted multivariable logistic regression analy-
ses were performed to determine the relative strength of
non-early surgery as a risk factor, relative to other demo-
graphic and medical risk factors. Adjusted odds ratios (OR)
and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. Statisti-
cal analyses were performed using SPSS 22 (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, New York).
Results
A total of 26 051 patients were included in the study. Of
these, 5921 (22.7%) underwent surgery within 24 hours of
admission and 20 130 (77.3%) underwent surgery after this
time (Table I). Patients who underwent early surgery were
more likely to be women, had a lower modified CCI, a lower

ASA grade and were less likely to be on chronic anticoagula-
tion. Propensity scores for undergoing surgery within 24
hours of admission were calculated based on the
demographics, BMI, modified CCI, ASA grade and a history
of anticoagulation. Propensity-adjusted p-values for com-
parisons between the early and non-early surgery groups
showed no statistically significant differences in baseline var-
iables, with adjusted p-values all > 0.05 (Table I).
On bivariate analysis, patients in the early surgery group
were less likely to have congestive heart failure, previous
cardiac surgery, and hypertension among the cardiovascular
comorbidities (Table II), and were less likely to have a history
of dyspnoea, diabetes or be on dialysis. With unadjusted
analysis and after Bonferroni correction, the early surgery
group had less overall post-operative complications,
respiratory complications and extended LOS (Table III).
Using propensity-adjusted multivariable logistic regression
analysis, patients in the early surgery group had decreased
odds of respiratory complications including pneumonia, fail-
ure to extubate, or reintubation (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to
0.90), as well as extended LOS ≥ 6 days (OR 0.84, 95%
CI 0.78 to 0.90) (Table IV). There were no statistically
significant differences between the early and non-early
groups for all other outcomes.
For post-operative respiratory complications, non-early
surgery as a risk factor (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.49) was
comparable with having a modified CCI of 6 (OR 1.34,
95% CI 1.16 to 1.56). More robust predictors of respira-
tory complications included an ASA grade of ≥ 3 (OR 2.14,
95% CI 1.69 to 2.70) and a history of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.73 to 2.31) (Table V).
In addition, while non-early surgery was a risk factor for
extended LOS (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.28), other var-
iables such as being on dialysis (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.40 to
2.06) and having a modified CCI of ≥ 7 (OR 1.56, 95% CI
1.41 to 1.72) were stronger predictors of an extended LOS.
Discussion
The timing of surgery for elderly patients with a fracture of
the hip is an area of debate, and requires a balance between
medical optimisation and minimising complications
associated with prolonged bedrest. This is a large retro-
spective study assessing mortality and post-operative com-
plications among these patients who are treated within or

beyond 24 hours of admission. While we did not identify a
reduced mortality in patients who were operated on within
24 hours of admission, earlier surgery conferred a signifi-
cant reduction in 30-day post-operative complications, par-
ticularly respiratory complications and an extended LOS.
Surgery within 24 hours of admission was found to be sig-
nificantly associated with reduced mortality by Beringer et al22
and Perez et al.25 The former was a retrospective cohort
study of 288 patients and the two-year survival in patients
who underwent surgery within 24 hours of admission was
74%, compared with 60% when surgery was undertaken >
48 hours after admission and 42% when it took place more
than three days after admission.22 Other authors also found
reduced mortality when surgery was undertaken < 12 hours
after admission.15,19 This suggests that there may only be
reduced mortality when surgery is undertaken soon after
admission, such as within six or 12 hours, and mortality is
equivalent at all other times before 48 hours after admis-
sion. There are no studies assessing mortality if surgery is
undertaken soon after admission; this is a potential area of
further study.
Surgery is often delayed due to the unavailability of an
operating theatre, lack of surgical staff or the optimisation
of medical conditions.13 The benefit of extensive pre-
operative investigations remains unclear, as it increases the
time to surgery, increases the LOS and only rarely changes
management.39 Previous studies may have been con-
founded by the fact that patients whose operations were
undertaken > 24 hours after admission had significant
comorbidities requiring optimisation and these conditions
influenced the post-operative morbidity. This study
attempted to account for these confounding variables by
using multivariable propensity-adjusted logistic regression
analysis. Factors that were found to be significant and that
were controlled for included age, gender, BMI, modified
CCI, ASA grade and a history of anticoagulation.
Propensity score adjustment successfully eliminated these
baseline differences.
There was a significant reduction in post-operative
complications, specifically respiratory complications and
extended LOS when patients were treated within 24 hours
of admission. These results are consistent with previous
studies that have shown that early surgery leads to a
decreased LOS and reduced infectious complications
(pneumonia, urinary tract infections), decubitus ulcers,
DVT and PE.16,17,25 The most common causes of death in
the immediate post-operative period in these patients are
pulmonary infections and cardiovascular causes.6,8,40 We
found a decreased risk of respiratory complications with
early surgery but no statistically significant reduction of
mortality 30 days post-operatively. In relation to other
patient demographic and medical risk factors, surgery after
24 hours of admission was roughly comparable with hav-
ing a modified CCI of six, and was a slightly less robust risk
factor compared with non-independent pre-operative
functional status, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and an ASA grade of ≥ 3.
The study had several limitations. First, and most impor-
tantly, it is subject to potential confounding in the early ver-
sus delayed surgical groups, as patients in the latter group

 SURGERY FOR A FRACTURE OF THE HIP WITHIN 24 HOURS OF ADMISSION
1221
VOL. 99-B, No. 9, SEPTEMBER 2017
may have a greater risk of complications due to comorbid-
ities that delayed surgery. However, a propensity score
model was used to adjust for this possible bias, which
successfully accounted for significant differences between
the groups in terms of age, gender, BMI, modified CCI,
ASA grade and a history of anticoagulation. These same
propensity scores were carried forward into multivariable
analyses. While the NSQIP allowed for assessment of
chronic illness, we were unable to control for the level of
acute illness with which a patient presented. Any acute
medical conditions such as pneumonia, heart failure, or
cardiographic changes that might delay surgery were not
available in the NSQIP. Similarly, we could not control for
the time from injury, but rather the time from admission.
This probably underestimates the total time for which a
patient is immobilised, as well as the hidden blood loss
from the fracture that persists until surgery.41,42 Further-
more, data about complications after the 30th post-opera-
tive day were not available in the NSQIP. An increased risk
of mortality persists for up to two years following a frac-
ture of the hip,2 and events beyond 30 days were not avail-
able. Finally, this database does not include functional
outcomes.
In conclusion, there is controversy and uncertainty
around the reduced morbidity and mortality that follows
surgery for a hip fracture in elderly patients within 24 hours
of admission. Determining the ideal time at which surgery
should be undertaken remains difficult. There is, however,
agreement that delay by > 48 hours places the patient at an
increased mortality risk. Our findings are in agreement
with previous studies that show no short-term reduced
mortality when surgery is undertaken within 24 hours.
However, it is clear that surgery at this time reduces the rate
of post-operative complications as shown in previous
studies, and further identified in this study. Therefore, it
may be prudent for elderly patients with these fractures
who are medically stable to undergo surgery as soon as pos-
sible to reduce post-operative complications. Further
research into the timing of surgery in these patients should
address topics such as the potential benefit of expedited
surgery using general anaesthesia in patients who are on
chronic anticoagulation, and whether direct admission to
monitored units improves the medical optimisation and
time to surgery.
Take home message:
- In elderly patients with hip fractures, operative fixation
within 24 hours of admission was independently associated
with decreased post-operative complications and length of hospital stay.
- Hip fracture patients who are medically stable should receive surgery as
soon as possible to reduce post-operative morbidity.
