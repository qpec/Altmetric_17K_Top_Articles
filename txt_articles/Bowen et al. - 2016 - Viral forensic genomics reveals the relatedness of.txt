Abstract
Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a widespread global pathogen, of which the strain KOS is one 
of the most extensively studied. Previous sequence studies revealed that KOS does not cluster with 
other strains of North American geographic origin, but instead clustered with Asian strains. We 
sequenced a historical isolate of the original KOS strain, called KOS63, along with a separately 
isolated strain attributed to the same source individual, termed KOS79. Genomic analyses revealed 
that KOS63 closely resembled other recently sequenced isolates of KOS and was of Asian origin, 
but that KOS79 was a genetically unrelated strain that clustered in genetic distance analyses with 
HSV-1 strains of North American/European origin. These data suggest that the human source of

Introduction
Infection with human herpesvirus 1, or herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1; genus Simplexvirus, 
subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae, order Herpesvirales) is widespread in 
humans, and is the causative agent of recurrent herpes labialis or genitalis (1). Initial 
infection takes place at epithelial or mucosal surfaces, where virus replicates actively to 
form self-limited lesions that involve interactions with innate and adaptive immunity (1). 
HSV-1 also enters sensory nerve endings and migrates in axons of the peripheral nervous 
system (PNS) by retrograde transport to neuronal nuclei located within sensory or 
sympathetic ganglia (2–4). It is in this cell population that HSV-1 establishes latency. The 
virus may spontaneously reactivate and produce intermittent shedding and/or clinical 
diseases throughout life (3, 5). Occasional invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) by 
HSV-1 can result in rare but severe and sometimes fatal encephalitis (6, 7). While antiviral 
drugs have been developed for HSV, these are only able to target the lytic replication stages 
and the intermittent cycles of productive viral replication (8–11). The latent state is largely 
refractory to current antivirals (8, 12). HSV remains the most studied herpesvirus, and 
knowledge of HSV has driven key advances in our fundamental knowledge of the 
mechanisms of herpesvirus entry, replication, gene expression, assembly and egress (1, 12–
14).
The vast majority of laboratory and genetic studies have been restricted to a relatively small 
number of HSV-1 strains and isolates, of which some of the most common are HSV-1 strains 
F, KOS, 17, SC16, and McKrae (1, 15–21). Strains of HSV differ greatly in phenotype, 
particularly in in vivo animal model systems of pathogenesis (18, 22–26). Variants of the 
same name or source are often presumed to be similar, but may show different genetic and 
phenotypic characterizations, demonstrating that this assumption does not always hold true 
(22, 27). For example, strains H166 and H166syn are distinctly different strains, both in 
phenotype and genotype, but arose from the same source patient (28, 29). Two recently 
published genome sequences of HSV-1 McKrae, which were based on strains propagated in 
different labs, revealed coding differences in genes such as UL36 and UL56 (30, 31). We 
recently demonstrated that clonal variants of strains KOS and F could differ in plaque 
phenotype and harbor numerous genetic differences despite their overall clonal identity (29). 
The genomes of five variants of KOS have been published (Table 1) (29, 32–34), and many 
more variants have been utilized in prior studies (15, 22, 34–37), before genome sequencing 
was a viable option. The history and genome sequences of several of these variants have 
recently been documented by Colgrove et al (34). These KOS variants have been noted to 
differ in virulence in animal models, as well as other phenotypes, but the genetic basis of 
these differences is not yet known (22, 29, 34, 38).

 Two variants of HSV-1 KOS, called KOS63 and KOS79, were noted relatively early on to 
differ dramatically in phenotype, both in vitro and in vivo (22). Limited genetic analyses 
using restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) and single-gene analysis by PCR 
suggested several differences. HSV-1 KOS63, which has an orolabial origin, has been 
passaged numerous times in multiple laboratories (15, 22, 34, 35, 37, 38), and is believed to 
represent the standard KOS isolates that circulate in many laboratories, but this has not been 
clearly established before this work. Another orolabial isolate attributed to the same 
individual, KOS79, has undergone minimal passage in the laboratory (22). In a matched 
comparison using both peripheral and intracerebral routes of HSV-1 infection, Dix et al. 
found that KOS79 was highly neurovirulent and neuroinvasive in mice, while KOS63 was 
much less so (22). KOS63 and KOS79 were suggested to be distinct strains on the basis of 
polypeptide synthesis and RFLP analyses, although the primary data were not shown (22). 
KOS79 has also been shown to harbor an extended array of tandem repeats in the 
neurovirulence protein ICP34.5, relative to a shorter array found in a plaque-purified variant 
of KOS called KOS321 (36, 39). A number of differences in the ICP0 promoter region of 
KOS and KOS79 have also been noted (40).
We set out to address the relatedness of the historical isolate KOS63, and the more virulent 
strain KOS79. We sequenced the full genomes of KOS79 and KOS63 and compared them to 
five published genome sequences of KOS (29, 32–34). We found that KOS63 and previously 
sequenced KOS variants are closely related to one another, akin to clonal variants from a 
parental population (29). However KOS63 and its clonal variants were all genetically distant 
from KOS79 – differing as much as unrelated strains isolated from individuals in disparate 
geographic regions. KOS79 clusters most closely with North American and European 
strains, while KOS63 and its variants cluster with Asian strains. These data provide further 
evidence that individuals may harbor quite disparate viral strains, and will enable future 
evaluations of the genetic basis of the neurovirulence of strain KOS79.
Results
Full genome sequencing of KOS79 and comparison to KOS
We used genome-wide comparative sequence analysis to illuminate the genetic relatedness 
of HSV-1 KOS79 to HSV-1 KOS63 and other previously described isolates of the KOS 
strain (Table 1). To do this, we first applied Illumina high-throughput sequencing to obtain 
sequence read data from viral nucleocapsid DNA of strains KOS79 and KOS63. Consensus 
genomes were generated for each strain using a previously described combination of de 
novo assembly and reference-guided assembly methods (Table 2; see Methods for details) 
(29). The genomes of KOS79 and KOS63 do not contain any truncated or missing proteins, 
with the exception of US9 in KOS63. The presence of a SNP (C>T) in US9, which generates 
an early stop codon that truncates the protein, has been described in multiple prior sequences 
of the KOS strain (29, 32, 41). Finding this identical SNP in KOS63 supported the premise 
that it is indeed closely related to the previously sequenced KOS isolates.
To analyze the genetic relatedness of KOS79, KOS63, and the previously sequenced KOS 
strains from our lab and others, we compared the identity and number of variant proteins 
among these strains (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 1). As an out-group, we included for

 comparison the unrelated HSV-1 reference strain 17. We observed that the newly sequenced 
KOS63 and previously sequenced KOS variants shared an average of 99.2% DNA identity 
(Table 3). In contrast, comparison of KOS63 or the other KOS variants to either KOS79 or 
strain 17 resulted in a lower DNA identity of 98.5%. This minor shift in percent identity 
across the genome translated into a sizable number of proteins harboring coding variations 
in each pairwise comparison. Between KOS63 and the KOS variants, an average of just 6 
proteins differ in any pairwise comparison (Table 3; see Supplementary Table 1 for complete 
list of variations). This is akin to what was previously observed for sister clones from a 
common parental virus stock (29). In contrast, pairwise comparison of any of these vs. 
KOS79 or strain 17 yields a similarly high number of over 60 proteins that harbor coding 
variations in each pairwise comparison (Table 3). Nine proteins are completely conserved 
between KOS79 and any of the KOS63-like variants: UL15, UL16, UL20, UL26.5, UL33, 
VP26 (UL35), UL45, VP22 (UL49A), and UL55, several of which were also highly 
conserved in our prior global analysis of more than 20 independent HSV-1 strains (42). 
Overall, the amount of difference observed in these comparisons suggested that KOS79 is as 
different from KOS63-like strains as the unrelated strain 17.
Since percent DNA identity does not reflect the location or distribution of differences 
between these genomes, we next estimated the evolutionary distance between these strains. 
As anticipated, the KOS63-like strains had the smallest genetic distance between them in 
any pairwise comparison, correlating with their high DNA identity (Figure 1). Comparison 
of either KOS79 or strain 17 to any of the KOS63-like variants resulted in a larger estimate 
of genetic distance, in keeping with the lower DNA identity (Figure 1). SplitsTree analysis 
of KOS79, KOS63-like variants, and strain 17 confirmed the close relationship among the 
KOS63-like variants, and placed KOS79 and strain 17 at nearly equidistant points away 
from the KOS63-like variants (Supplementary Figure 1). The distance between KOS79 and 
any of the other KOS variants suggests that it is a distinct and unrelated strain.
Genetic distance analysis and the likely geographic origin of strain KOS79
In a previous comparison of HSV-1 genomes from diverse geographic areas, we found that a 
majority of strains clustered near those from the same geographic origin (42). The 
KOSDavido isolate included in that publication was the sole exception, where despite its USA 
origin, KOSDavido clustered with strains of Asian origin (42, 43). To place KOS79 within the 
context of this study, we integrated KOS79 and KOS63 into the prior 26-genome alignment 
and computed the genetic distance among these strains. In this analysis, KOS79 clustered 
with 100% bootstrap confidence with HSV-1 strains F and H129, which were also isolated in 
the USA (Figure 2). This trio is found within a larger 100% bootstrap confidence cluster, 
which includes three other European and North American strains, HF10, 17 and McKrae. 
This contrasts with KOS63 and KOSDavido, which are assigned to the Asian genetic distance 
cluster with equal confidence. Although attributed to the same individual, KOS63 and 
KOS79 are fundamentally distinct strains that appear to have distant geographic historical 
origins.
The extensive recombination that is postulated to occur in HSV precludes a cladistic analysis 
using these data on genetic distance (42, 44–48). To investigate the possibility of

 recombination between KOS63 and KOS79 in the original host, we performed SimPlot 
analysis using KOS79, KOS63, a consensus of the European cluster (strains HF10, 17, 
McKrae, F and H129) and a consensus of the Africa-1 cluster (strains E08, E12, E13, E14 
and E19) from our prior study (Supplementary Figure 2A) (42). We observed that KOS79 is 
most closely related to the European consensus over most of its length, except for a few 
short regions where it is most similar to the Africa-1 consensus (e.g. between kilobases 
45-50 and 97-102) or where no predominant background can be identified (e.g. between 
kilobases 60-65 and 80-85). The corresponding BootScan plot (Supplementary Figure 2B) 
shows chi-shaped crossover signals supportive of recombination with an African strain at 
97-102 kb, although the other two areas of African similarity have less well formed signs of 
crossover. BootScan analysis suggests potential recombination between KOS79 and KOS63 
at 60-65 kb and 80-85kb, though this finding should be viewed with caution because the 
SimPlot analysis implies genetic equidistance between all strains in these regions. Accurate 
recombination analysis in HSV-1 will always be complicated by the deep evolutionary 
history of the species, the extent of recent intercontinental travel with plentiful opportunities 
for recombination, and the fundamental genetic similarity of all known strains (e.g. more 
than 98.5% identical over any 10 kb window).
Rapid PCR test to distinguish KOS79 and KOS63
Previous analyses have often grouped KOS63 and KOS79 together (39, 40), although the 
genomic data now indicate that these viruses are likely to be significantly different. Since the 
possibility exists that some labs may have initiated studies with a KOS isolate derived from 
either KOS63 or KOS79, we considered it important to develop an easy assay to distinguish 
these strains. We therefore designed primers to amplify segments of the tegument proteins 
UL14 and UL25 (Supplementary Table 2), which each contain a strain-specific restriction 
digest site for NcoI or NdeI (Figure 3). The KOS79 genome contains an NcoI site in UL14 
while KOS63 and its variants do not (Figure 3A). KOS63 and its variants contain an NdeI 
site in UL25 that is not present in KOS79 (Figure 3C). To confirm these sequencing results, 
nucleocapsid DNA from HSV-1 strains 17, KOS63, and KOS79 were used to PCR amplify 
these regions of UL14 and UL25. These amplicons were then subjected to restriction digest 
and analyzed. Examination of digestion products revealed the expected patterns (Figure 
3B,D). Sanger sequencing was used to confirm ten additional SNPs in the UL14 amplicon, 
and one additional SNP in the UL25 amplicon, that differ between KOS63 and KOS79 (data 
not shown). This diagnostic tool can be implemented to quickly screen and identify KOS 
virus stocks or recombinant derivatives within any laboratory as being either KOS63-like or 
KOS79.
RFLP analysis of KOS strains
To validate the newly assembled genomes for KOS63-like and KOS79 using an alternative 
method, actual RFLP patterns were compared to those predicted from each genome 
sequence. Computational comparison of KOS63 and KOS79 predicted the loss of a HindIII 
restriction site in glycoprotein M (gM; UL10) in strain KOS79, resulting in the loss of a 2.8 
kb band that exists in KOS63-like variants. In the historical lettering system for HSV-1 DNA 
restriction fragments, this 2.8 kb band was referred to as the “O” fragment (49–51) (Figure 
4A). As expected, the 2.8 kb “O” fragment was not present after HindIII digestion of KOS79

 DNA, but was present in strains KOS and 17 (Figure 4B-C). This O-I fusion event has been 
previously noted to occur in African and European strains of HSV-1, but not in Asian strains 
(52). Finding the fusion in KOS79, but not KOS63, correlates with the geographic history 
suggested for each strain by genetic distance analysis (Figure 2). Taken together, these 
results indicate the wide genetic divergence of KOS79 and KOS63, and highlight that 
genetic comparisons of these strains will reveal many differences regardless of the 
phenotype under examination (22, 39, 40).
Discussion
KOS is one of the most extensively used strains in HSV-1 research, particularly in the United 
States. It was isolated from a volunteer in the 1960s (15, 43). In addition to its use in many 
mechanistic and genetic studies, the KOS strain has also been used to develop vaccine 
antigens and vectors (53–56). The full genome sequence of HSV KOS (here called 
KOSDavido) was first published in 2012 (32), and later duplicated with a high degree of 
fidelity by the Kinchington group, using a 1981 master stock obtained from Neal DeLuca at 
the University of Pittsburgh (JQ780693; here called KOSKinchington) (33), and further 
detailed by Knipe, Coen and colleagues using a master stock provided by Priscilla Schaffer 
(here called KOSKnipe and KOS1.1) (34). A plaque-purified isolate of KOS (called 
KOSLarge) was sequenced by our own group using a stock obtained from Hendricks, 
Kinchington and colleagues (29, 57). Previous work by Iwasaki and colleagues (37) 
highlighted potential immune-evasion differences in the isolates of HSV-1 KOS held by 
different labs, but the genetic basis of these variants has not been investigated. Here we 
present the first analysis of overall genetic identity among the five publicly available genome 
sequences of KOS, and we extend this comparison to include newly sequenced genomes of 
the historically-dated strains KOS63 and KOS79. These additional strains have distinct 
levels of virulence in animal models, as previously characterized by Dix et al (22), with 
KOS79 showing significantly higher levels of neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness than 
KOS63.
One of the differences between KOS79 and KOS63 that may contribute to the higher 
virulence of KOS79 in vivo is its intact US9 protein. Previous authors have shown that US9 
is involved in anterograde transport of viral capsids and glycoproteins to axonal termini in 
related alphaherpesviruses, such as pseudorabies virus (PRV) (58–60). However the role of 
US9 in anterograde transport of HSV-1 is less clear (61–64). KOS63 and its variants have a 
mutation present in the TATA-box promoter region of the membrane protein US9, as well as 
a substitution at position 58 in the US9 gene. This substitution introduces an early stop 
codon, and truncates the last 32 residues of the US9 protein (32, 41). This mutation removes 
the stop codon and elongates the neighboring open reading frame of US8A, a protein of 
undetermined function (32, 41). The new availability of complete coding sequences for 
KOS79 and KOS63 will enable future studies on how the differences in other herpesvirus 
proteins contribute to their observed differences in virulence phenotypes.
KOS63 and KOS79 were reportedly isolated from the same volunteer on separate occasions 
(15, 22, 43). The historical record does not allow us to confirm these isolations or to collect 
a fresh isolate from the same individual, but the frequent usage of KOS63-like variants in

 labs around the world makes it imperative to clarify their history as much as possible. We 
present here a rapid PCR and restriction digest test to allow labs to easily distinguish 
between KOS79 and the classic KOS63-like strains. In past studies, authors did not 
distinguish whether KOS63 and KOS79 were passage variants—i.e. high- and low-passage 
variants from a common parental stock—or were unrelated isolates (40, 39). Here we 
showed that KOS79 is genetically distinct from KOS63-like strains, with sufficient 
divergence that one could posit independent geographic acquisitions of HSV-1 infection 
(43). These data remove the possibility that KOS63 represents a passage variant of KOS79, a 
hypothesis that arose from examples of attenuation by serial passage for related 
herpesviruses (65–67). If they arose in the same source, the historical dating of strains 
KOS63 and KOS79 (from 1963 and 1979 respectively; (22)) suggests that these viruses 
reactivated independently of one another and at different times. It is impossible to determine 
now whether these historical isolates also arose from different body sites, which emphasizes 
the importance of recording full clinical details for new isolates. In future studies of extant 
cases, it will be important to determine how viral reactivation and shedding occur in dual- or 
multiply-infected individuals, with attention to aspects of space, time, and genetic variation.
Methods
Virus culture and DNA isolation
Stocks of HSV-1 KOS63 and KOS79 were obtained from R. Dix and expanded in adherent 
MRC-5 (ATCC®, CCL-171) human fetal lung fibroblast cells. MRC-5 cultures grown in 
Eagle's Minimum Essential Media (EMEM; Sigma-Aldrich) were infected at an MOI of 
0.01 and harvested when cultures displayed significant cytopathic-effect (CPE). These 
master stocks were titered on Vero cells (ATCC®, CCL-81) for easier plaque visualization. 
For DNA preparation, MRC-5 cultures were infected at an MOI of 5 and viral genomic 
DNA (gDNA) was isolated via a nucleocapsid preparation assay previously described (68). 
Similarly prepared gDNA from KOSLarge (29) and from plaque-purified HSV-1 strain 17 
were used in the RFLP and PCR studies below.
Next generation sequencing
Viral gDNA was sheared and prepared for sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq. Viral 
nucleocapsid DNA was sheared using a Covaris M220 sonicator/disruptor, with the 
following parameters: 60 seconds duration, peak power 50, 10% duty cycle, at 4°C. The 
Illumina TruSeq DNA sample prep kit was used to prepare barcoded sequencing libraries, 
according to the manufacturer's low-throughput protocol. Libraries were quantified and 
assessed by Qubit (Invitrogen, CA), Bioanalyzer (Agilent), and qPCR for library adaptors 
(KAPA Biosystems). Paired-end sequencing (2 × 300 bp length) was carried out on our lab's 
Illumina MiSeq instrument, according to manufacturer's recommendations, with 17 pM 
input. All sequence data has been deposited at the NCBI Short Read Archive under 
BioProject ID PRJNA295931. Sequence alignments are also openly available from the 
Lancaster University data archive at http://dx.doi.org/10.17635/lancaster/researchdata/29.
Consensus viral genomes were assembled using a recently described viral genome assembly 
(VirGA) workflow (29). Briefly, this workflow performs a number of quality control filters,

 including removal of contaminating host sequences, adaptors from library preparation, or 
image-acquisition artifacts. It then carries out multiple iterations of de novo assembly using 
SSAKE, which are combined into longer blocks of sequence (contigs) using Celera and 
GapFiller. The Mugsy alignment package is used to match these contigs to a reference 
genome for HSV-1 (strain 17, JN555585). The best matching contigs are stitched into a 
single consensus genome using a VirGA-specific script called mafnet. Finally, an array of 
quality-control measures are used to annotate, query, and improve the draft consensus 
genome. These include comparing the pileup of raw sequence reads to the initial draft 
genome, detecting polymorphisms within the sequence, identification of sequence features, 
gaps, and low coverage areas, and validation of selected areas by PCR and Sanger 
sequencing. Consensus genome sequences for KOS79 and KOS63 have been deposited in 
GenBank under accessions KT425109 and KT425110.
Pairwise identity and genetic distance comparisons
Trimmed genome sequences, lacking the terminal copies of the large repeats, were used for 
genetic distance comparisons to avoid giving undue weight to the repeats. In strains 
KOSDavido, KOSKnipe, and KOS1.1, the lengths of several reiterations (also known as 
variable number tandem repeats, or VNTRs) have been artificially set to match the 
reiteration copy number from the reference strain 17 (32, 34). We used the annotation of 
these VNTRs in the GenBank accession of KOSDavido (JQ673480) to locate and remove 
these regions from all pairwise calculations of distance and percent identity. ClustalW2 (69) 
was used to construct pairwise global nucleotide alignments between whole genome 
sequences and pairwise global amino acid alignments between ORFs. These alignments 
were utilized by downstream custom Python scripts to calculate percent identity, protein 
differences, and genetic distance between samples. Further, an all-vs.-all alignment was used 
to generate a NeighborNet phylogenetic network in SplitsTree (44, 45, 70) with Uncorrected 
P distances in order to illustrate potential evolutionary relationships between strains.
Global genetic distance and recombination analyses
KOS79 was incorporated into the genome-wide alignment from Szpara et al. (42) using 
MAFFT with input parameters specified to freeze the prior alignment (71). Addition of 
KOS79 and KOS63 did not alter the published alignment of any of the other 26 HSV-1 
genomes (42). The source alignment is found on the accompanying data website to Szpara et 
al. (42): http://szparalab.psu.edu/hsv-diversity/. Genetic distances were calculated in 
MEGA6 (72) using the Maximum Composite Likelihood measure and a dendrogram was 
produced using the Unweighted Paired Group Mean (Arithmetic) method (UPGMA) with 
1000 bootstrap replicates (73, 74). Recombination was analyzed using SimPlot (75).
RFLP analysis
Nucleocapsid DNA was digested overnight at 37°C using the restriction enzymes BamHI, 
EcoRI, and HindIII (New England BioLabs), according to the company's specifications. 250 
ng of DNA was used in each reaction along with the recommended buffer for each 
restriction enzyme. Samples were visualized on a 1.0% agarose gel with ethidium bromide 
(Fisher Bio-Reagents) after overnight separation. Digital digests of the corresponding draft 
genomes were carried out using the software Geneious (version 7.1.7, created by Biomatters, 
Bowen et al.

 available from http://www.geneious.com). These predicted patterns were compared against 
actual banding from above digestions, to assess draft genome matching to the observed 
RFLP banding patterns.
Restriction digest of PCR amplicons
Primers were designed flanking NcoI and NdeI restriction endonuclease cut sites in UL14 
and UL25 respectively (Table 1). HSV 17, KOS79, KOSLg and KOS gDNA was boiled for 
five minutes and then snap-cooled on ice for five minutes. PCR was conducted in 50 μl 
reaction volumes using 3 μl of template DNA, 1 unit of PrimeStar GXL DNA polymerase 
(Clontech), 200 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 1 μM primers, and 1X buffer. PCR 
conditions in an Eppendorf Mastercycler Nexus gradient were as follows: 98°C for 2 
minutes, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 98°C for 10 seconds, 15 seconds of 
annealing at 55°C for UL25 or 60°C for UL14, and primer extension at 68°C for 1 minute. 
Final extension was carried out at 68°C for 2 minutes. PCR amplicons were then subjected 
to restriction digest using NcoI and NdeI (New England Biosciences). 20 μl of PCR mixture 
containing the amplicon of interest was mixed with 5 μl of enzyme-appropriate buffer, 24 μl 
of water, and 1 μl of restriction endonuclease. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour, 
then heat inactivated at either 65°C for NdeI or 80°C for NcoI. Digested samples were then 
purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Standard agarose gel 
electrophoresis was used to separate and visualize bands. Gels were run at 100 volts for 1 
hour at room temperature.

 Figure 1. 
Genome sequence comparisons reveal that KOS63 is as different from KOS79 as from the 
HSV-1 reference strain 17. The genome sequences of multiple variants of KOS63 (green) 
were compared to those of KOS79 (blue) and the HSV-1 reference strain 17 (red). For every 
possible pairwise combination of genomes, we calculated the genetic distance and the 
percent DNA identity (see Methods for details; see also Table 3). Points are color-coded to 
reflect the pairs in each comparison, with strain labels next to each point (see below for 
abbreviations). The x-axis reflects decreasing percent identity, while the y-axis reflects 
increasing genetic distance. In both cases, more disparate pairwise comparisons will plot 
further from the origin. Shaded circles provide a visual guide to the groups of pairwise 
comparisons. Green shading indicates pairwise combinations of KOS63-like strains, blue 
shading indicates combinations involving strain KOS79, and red shading indicates 
combinations involving strain 17. Yellow shading indicates the sole pairwise combination of 
strains 17 and KOS79. Trimmed genome sequences, lacking the terminal copies of the large 
repeats, were used for all comparisons to avoid giving undue weight to the repeats. 
Reiteration lengths in several published strains (32, 34) are artificially matched to strain 17, 
so these regions were removed from all comparisons as well (see Methods for details). 
Abbreviations are as follows: Da, KOSDavido from Davido and colleagues (32); Lg,

Genetic distance reveals that KOS63 and KOSDavido cluster separately from KOS79 in a 
global collection of HSV-1 strains.
We extended a prior dendrogram analysis of 26 HSV-1 strains of global distribution (42) to 
include strains KOS63 and KOS79. KOS63 and the originally-included KOSDavido strain 
both cluster with HSV-1 strains of Asian origin, while KOS79 groups with HSV-1 strains of 
European and North American origin. Dendrogram was calculated with UPGMA in MEGA 
(1,000 bootstrap replicates). Branch confidence values are indicated on the tree. Scale bar 
indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions per kilobase.

RFLP analysis of HSV-1 KOS variants.
Diagram of the HSV-1 genome (top) and predicted HindIII restriction sites (bottom). The 
location (A) and sizes (B) of the historical lettering systems for HindIII fragments (49–51) 
predicted for these genomes are also illustrated. Fusion of fragment O and I, due to loss of a 
HindIII site in gM (UL10), has been previously noted in a number of HSV-1 strains. This 
loss occurs in strain KOS79, both in the genome sequence (B) and in RFLP analysis (C) 
after HindIII digestion of viral nucleocapsid DNA. Abbreviations in the genome diagram are 
as follows: TRL/IRL, terminal/internal repeat of the long region; IRS/TRS, internal/terminal 
repeat of the short region.
