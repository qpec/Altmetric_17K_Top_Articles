SUMMARY
Ingestion is a highly regulated behavior that inte-
grates taste and hunger cues to balance food intake
with metabolic needs. To study the dynamics of
ingestion in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster,
we developed Expresso, an automated feeding
assay that measures individual meal-bouts with
high temporal resolution at nanoliter scale. Flies
showed discrete, temporally precise ingestion that
was regulated by hunger state and sucrose concen-
tration. We identify 12 cholinergic local interneu-
rons (IN1, for ‘‘ingestion neurons’’) necessary for
this behavior. Sucrose ingestion caused a rapid and
persistent increase in IN1 interneuron activity in
fasted flies that decreased proportionally in response
to subsequent feeding bouts. Sucrose responses of
IN1 interneurons in fed flies were significantly smaller
and lacked persistent activity. We propose that
IN1 neurons monitor ingestion by connecting sugar-
sensitive taste neurons in the pharynx to neural
circuits that control the drive to ingest. Similar mech-
anisms for monitoring and regulating ingestion may
exist in vertebrates.
INTRODUCTION
All animals must simultaneously integrate external sensory stim-
uli with internal state to control behavioral decisions (Davis,
1979; Tinbergen, 1951). One behavior under strict neural and
metabolic control is eating, which is regulated both by peripheral
sensory detection of food and by internally generated states of
hunger and satiety (Brobeck et al., 1943; Burton et al., 1976;
Hoebel and Teitelbaum, 1962; Kennedy, 1953; Mayer, 1953;
Raubenheimer and Simpson, 1997; Read et al., 1994). Perturba-
tions in these homeostatic systems can lead to obesity and
associated health problems (Morton et al., 2014). In both verte-
brates and insects, the optimization of food intake requires tight
regulation of behaviors responsive to food quality and hunger
state. Once food is ingested, it takes several minutes for enteric
nutrient sensing to regulate subsequent eating behavior, which
may be too slow to control the amount of food ingested (Dus
et al., 2015; Miyamoto et al., 2012; Zukerman et al., 2011). The
biology of ingestion is poorly understood.
Mechanisms of peripheral taste processing and the regulation
of the hunger state have been studied intensively in vertebrates.
Taste receptors in the mouth and cortical regions in the brain that
respond to taste qualities have been identified (de Araujo and
Simon, 2009; Barretto et al., 2015; Chandrashekar et al., 2010;
Chen et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2006; Mueller et al., 2005; Nelson
et al., 2001; Zhao et al., 2003). The activation of sweet cells
promotes food acceptance in hungry animals, while the activa-
tion of bitter cells stimulates food avoidance (Mueller et al.,
2005; Zhao et al., 2003). Neurons in the hypothalamic neuroen-
docrine circuits express proopiomelanocortin (POMC), agouti-
related peptide (AgRP), and melanocortin receptor (MC4R) and
orchestrate ingestion in response to the hunger state of the ani-
mal (Aponte et al., 2011; Atasoy et al., 2012; Carter et al., 2013;
Fan et al., 1997).
The mechanisms controlling taste and food intake in insects
are remarkably similar to those in vertebrates. Drosophila flies
detect and evaluate food using taste cells located in the pe-
riphery (Stocker, 1994). The insect equivalent of the vertebrate
tongue is the labellum on the proboscis. This structure is deco-
rated with taste sensilla that house gustatory neurons, which
express gustatory receptors (GRs) that respond to sweet or
bitter tastants (Chyb et al., 2003; Clyne et al., 2000; Dahanukar
et al., 2001, 2007; Scott et al., 2001; Weiss et al., 2011). Stimula-
tion of sweet taste neurons in the labellum and legs triggers
extension of the proboscis in fasted flies, followed by initiation
of food intake (Dethier, 1976; Dethier et al., 1956). Upon inges-
tion, food comes in contact with taste neurons located in the
pharynx (Stocker, 1994). The function of these pharyngeal taste
neurons is poorly understood, but a subset has been shown to
regulate sugar ingestion (LeDue et al., 2015).
Taste neuron afferents from the mouthparts and pharynx
target distinct regions of the subesophageal zone (Ito et al.,
2014), the taste center of the fly brain (Marella et al., 2006).
This is a densely innervated brain structure housing projection
neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons that are required
for taste acceptance, along with motor circuits that regulate
ingestion (Flood et al., 2013; Gordon and Scott, 2009; Kain and

 Dahanukar, 2015; Manzo et al., 2012; Marella et al., 2012;
Miyazaki et al., 2015; Pool et al., 2014). Additionally, neuromo-
dulators, including dopamine, serotonin, neuropeptide F, and
short-neuropeptide F, modulate food intake by altering the ac-
tivity of sensory neurons that detect food stimuli or by changing
the activity of homeostatic neurons that regulate hunger (Albin
et al., 2015; Inagaki et al., 2012, 2014b; Root et al., 2011).
We hypothesized that there must be a rapid sensor of inges-
tion interposed between peripheral taste detection and meta-
bolic nutrient sensing. To identify such a sensor in Drosophila,
we first developed a high-resolution food ingestion assay,
Expresso. This system measures ingestion of individual flies in
real time at nanoliter resolution. We used Expresso to show
that flies make rapid feeding decisions based on hunger state
and sucrose concentration. We identify 12 cholinergic local inter-
neurons (IN1, for ‘‘ingestion neurons’’) in the taste center of the
fly brain that regulate sucrose ingestion. IN1 neurons receive
selective input from sweet taste neurons in the pharynx (LeDue
et al., 2015). We used in vivo functional calcium imaging to
show that IN1 activity increased rapidly in hungry flies after
sucrose ingestion, switching these neurons into a state of
sustained activation that lasted for minutes. As the fasted fly
continued to ingest sucrose over the course of the experiment,
the activity of IN1 neurons progressively decreased. Sustained
IN1 activation was strongly attenuated in fed flies offered su-
crose or in fasted flies offered a lower concentration of sucrose.
Furthermore, when IN1 neurons were optogenetically activated
in fed flies, they ingested food as if they were fasted. Our work
provides functional evidence for the existence of a taste circuit
that senses food intake via the pharynx and rapidly integrates
taste information with hunger state to control the rate, volume,
and timing of ingestion.
RESULTS
Expresso, a High-Resolution Feeding Assay
No existing fly-feeding assay measures real-time ingestion by
single flies at high resolution (Cognigni et al., 2011; Deshpande
et al., 2014; Edgecomb et al., 1994; Navawongse et al., 2015).
The proboscis extension assay measures the likelihood that
a fly will extend its proboscis in response to food (Shiraiwa and
Carlson, 2007). Two groups recently automated this manual
assay to quantify the interactions of a fly with a food source
(Itskov et al., 2014; Ro et al., 2014). These assays provide a proxy
for appetitive behavior, but they do not directly measure food
ingestion. The capillary feeder (CAFE) assay (Ja et al., 2007) mea-
sures ingestion directly from groups of flies, and the the manual-
feeding (MAFE) assay measures ingestion bouts of individual
flies (Qi et al., 2015). Because both require manual measure-
ments, their temporal resolution and/or throughput are limited.
To investigate factors regulating the temporal dynamics of
food ingestion, we developed an automated version of the
CAFE assay called ‘‘Expresso,’’ which allows us to capture
nanoliter-volume meal-bouts of single flies simultaneously,
with high temporal resolution. Expresso consists of multiple
single-fly feeding chambers, each connected to a sensor bank
(Figures 1A and 1B; Figures S1A–S1E). When a fly drinks from
the capillary, Expresso analysis software automatically detects
individual meal-bouts in real time by measuring the rapid
decrease in liquid level (Figure 1C; Figures S1A–S1C; Movie S1).
Accuracy was verified by manually annotating videos of fly
ingestion, while ingestion volume was simultaneously monitored
by the Expresso. The concordance between Expresso (hardware
and software) and the human observer was 94% for all bouts and
100% for bouts larger than 10 nl (Figure S1D). Meal-bout volumes
of fasted flies varied between 6 and 200 nl, and volume was highly
correlated with duration (Figure S1E). We compared the feeding
behaviors of male and female flies fasted for 24 hr and confirmed
that flies of both sexes consumed liquid food robustly (Ja et al.,
2007) (Figures S1F and S1G). We also quantified several mea-
sures that captured the dynamics of food ingestion (Figures
S1H–S1N). Female flies showed a small increase in latency but
consumed food more rapidly than males (Figures S1K and S1L).
Fasted flies concentrated their meal-bouts at the beginning of
the experiment and rapidly reached half-total ingestion (median,
34.77 s in females and 56.44 s in males) (Figures S1M and S1N).
Temporal Dynamics of Ingestion Are Dramatically
Altered by Hunger and Sucrose Concentration
Hunger state and the quality of food offered affect ingestion
(Ostlund et al., 2013; Spector et al., 1998). We examined this
by progressively fasting flies and monitoring sucrose ingestion.
Most of the fed flies (0 hr fasted) did not consume 1 M sucrose.
As fasting time increased, more flies initiated feeding with shorter

 latencies and higher rates, resulting in greater consumption of
1 M sucrose (Figures 1D–1H). 24-hr-fasted flies consumed 1 M
sucrose at much higher rates than fed flies (Figures 1I and 1J).
These hungry flies concentrated their meal-bouts within the first
minute (median half-total ingestion, 11.31–27.74 s) (Figures 1K
and 1L), and their rate of ingestion decreased rapidly thereafter
(Figures 1I and 1J).
Next, we tested the effects of sucrose concentration on inges-
tion dynamics. At all sucrose concentrations tested, the number
of 24-hr-fasted flies feeding was the same (Figure 2C), but
feeding dynamics were strikingly different (Figures 2A–2J). Flies
consumed greater volumes of 100 mM sucrose than 1 mM,
10 mM, and 1 M sucrose, indicating that both the taste, caloric
content, and amount of sucrose determine the total amount of
ingestion at longer timescales (Figures 2D–2F). At lower sucrose
concentrations, flies consumed short meal-bouts spaced over
the 33-min experiment, and the overall volume consumed was
low (Figures 2D–2F). As sucrose concentration increased, the in-
tensity of ingestion increased, leading to higher bout volumes and
ingestion rates (Figures 2F–2H). This higher intensity feeding was
also temporally concentrated, with animals that were offered 1 M
sucrosereachingmedianhalf-totalingestionafter 18.25 s(Figures
2Iand2J).Incontrast,medianhalf-totalingestionatlowersucrose
concentrations ranged from 153 s to 520 s (Figures 2I and 2J).
A Genetic Screen for Neurons that Regulate Ingestion
Post-ingestive nutrient-sensing pathways compute the caloric
content of ingested food and regulate subsequent feeding. How-
ever, this response is relatively slow, developing over a period of
minutes (de Araujo et al., 2008; Dus et al., 2011; Miyamoto et al.,
2012; Zukerman et al., 2011). We hypothesized that flies have a
mechanism to rapidly integrate hunger state with sucrose con-
centration to regulate moment-to-moment ingestion. This mech-
anism would operate between the initial sensing of sweet food
and the post-prandial rise in circulating sugar levels.
To screen for neurons required for rapid modulation of inges-
tion, we genetically inactivated subpopulations of neurons and
monitored ingestion dynamics. Using the Gal4/UAS system
(Brand and Perrimon, 1993), we expressed tetanus toxin light
chain, which blocks evoked synaptic transmission by cleaving
neuronal synaptobrevin (Sweeney et al., 1995). Of 105 viable
lines tested in the conventional CAFE assay (Ja et al., 2007),
two lines reproducibly showed reduced food intake, and we
focused on 57F03-Gal4 (hereinafter, 57F03>) (Figure 3A).
57F03> tetanus toxin flies ingested less liquid and solid food
than genetic controls (Figures S2A–S2C) but showed normal
proboscis extension to food and normal locomotor/geotaxis
behaviors (Figures S2D–S2F).
Using a membrane-tethered GFP, we detected 57F03> in
small numbers of neurons in the brain (Figure 3B), ventral nerve
cord (Figure 3C), and taste neurons in the labellum that express
the chemosensory receptor Ir25a (Benton et al., 2009) (Fig-
ure 3D). 57F03> also labeled non-neuronal, non-glial cells in
legs, maxillary palp, and antenna (data not shown). In the brain,
57F03> expression was limited to the subesophageal zone
(Figure 3B).
Because the original screen used chronic synaptic silencing,
we asked whether acute neuronal silencing also disrupted
ingestion. We conditionally inactivated 57F03> neurons with
the temperature-sensitive dominant-negative form of dynamin
(shits). At temperatures above 29�C, shits reversibly inhibits syn-
aptic transmission by blocking membrane recycling (Kitamoto,
2001). The percentage of 24-hr-fasted 57F03> shits flies that
consumed 1 M sucrose at the permissive temperature of 23�C
was normal (Figures 3E–3G). However, silencing these neurons
at the restrictive temperature of 30�C caused 57F03> shits flies
to alter the temporal structure of feeding, resulting in a dramatic
reduction in total ingestion, bout volume, and ingestion rate
(Figures 3H–3J).
Cholinergic Local Interneurons Control the Dynamics of
Sucrose Ingestion
To clarify which 57F03> neurons are functionally required for
food ingestion, we inhibited the activity of Gal4 in selected tis-
sues and cell types using the Gal80 repressor (Lee and Luo,
1999). 57F03> tetanus toxin flies expressing pan-neuronal
Elav-Gal80 (Yang et al., 2009) exhibited normal feeding, confirm-
ing that the 57F03> effect on feeding is due to the silencing of
neurons (Figures S2G and S2H). We ruled out a role for taste
neurons in the labellum, interneurons in the ventral nerve cord,
and motor neurons in the brain using Ir25a-Gal80, Tsh-Gal80
(Clyne and Miesenbo
¨ ck, 2008), and Vglut-Gal80 (Bussell et al.,
2014), respectively (Figures S2G and S2H). In these animals,
57F03> expression was limited to �25 local interneurons in the
brain (Figure S2H). To identify the minimum number of neurons
responsible for the food ingestion defect, we screened the Jane-
lia Farm FlyLight Gal4 Collection (Jenett et al., 2012) for expres-
sion patterns that overlap with 57F03> (Figure 4A) and identified
83F01>. We used FLP-recombinase-mediated recombination
to label the 57F03> and 83F01> intersection. FLP controls site-
specific recombination between FRT (FLP recombination target)
sites (Golic and Lindquist, 1989). We confirmed that this method
recapitulated 57F03> expression (Figures S3A and S3B). In the
brain, the 57F03> and 83F01> intersection selectively labeled
�12 interneurons (Figure 4A) with projections limited to the sub-
esophageal zone (Figures 4B and 4C). IN1 processes cross the

tion, meal-bout volume, and ingestion
rate were dramatically reduced (Figures
4H–4J).
To characterize the polarity and neuro-
chemistry of IN1 neurons, we labeled
them with markers enriched in axons
(GFP fusedtosynaptotagmin)or dendrites
(GFP fused to Dscam) (Wang et al., 2004;
Zhang et al., 2002). Synaptotagmin-GFP
and

not express dopaminergic, serotonergic,

markers
(data not shown). However, IN1> expres-
sion was blocked by Gal80 expression in
cholinergic cells, suggesting that these
neurons are cholinergic (Figures S4C and
S4D). Acetylcholine is the major excitatory
neurotransmitter in the Drosophila brain.

Sensitive Neurons in the Pharynx
Our behavioral and anatomical experi-
ments suggest that IN1 neurons consti-
tute a previously uncharacterized class
of cholinergic local interneurons in the fly taste center required
for sustained sucrose ingestion. We characterized sensory input
to IN1 from the taste periphery (Figures 5A and 5B) with Gr-Gal4
strains to label neurons expressing sweet (Chyb et al., 2003; Da-
hanukar et al., 2007; Miyamoto et al., 2012) or bitter (Weiss et al.,
2011) taste receptors. The axons of bitter and sweet taste neu-
rons with cell bodies in the labellum did not overlap with IN1

 neurons (Figures 5C–5F and 5I–5L, right panels). In contrast,
afferents from sugar-sensitive taste neurons that line the labral
organ of the pharynx overlapped with IN1 interneuron arbors
(Figures 5E–5H and 5K–5N, left panels).
To determine whether IN1 neurons are synaptically connected
to afferent sensory axons from the pharynx, we used a modifi-
cation of the GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners
(GRASP) method (Feinberg et al., 2008) to label synaptic sites
selectively (Chen et al., 2014) (Figure 5O). There was a significant
GRASP signal between IN1 interneurons and sugar-sensitive
pharyngeal taste neurons labeled by Gr43a and Gr64a (Fig-
ure 5P). We detected no GRASP signal between IN1 interneu-
rons and Gr5a sweet taste neurons on the labellum (Figure 5P).
We conclude that IN1 interneurons receive specific input from
sweet taste neurons in the pharynx.
IN1 Activation by Sucrose Ingestion and Its Modulation
by Hunger State
Next, we asked whether IN1 neurons respond to sucrose inges-
tion and whether this activation is altered by satiation, as pre-
dicted by the behavioral and anatomical results presented earlier.
We used in vivo two-photon imaging of head-fixed flies express-
ing the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6s in IN1 neu-
rons (Figures S5A and S5B). Rapid volumetric imaging of the
GCaMP6s fluorescence in the IN1 neuronal arbor was monitored
while 24-hr-fasted flies were offered a drop of 1 M sucrose or wa-
ter (Figures 6A and 6D; Movie S2). IN1 neurons did not respond
when the proboscis touched the sucrose drop or when flies
ingested water but were strongly activated when 1 M sucrose
was ingested (Figures 6A–6D). Because we did not image
GCaMP6s activity in individual IN1 cell bodies, we cannot exclude
the possibility that only some of these neurons responded to
sucrose ingestion. In the example shown in Figures 6A and 6B,
the fasted fly consumed the entire 20-nl drop in one continuous
bout. As the fly drank, GCaMP6s activity rose rapidly and re-
mained elevated throughout the ingestion bout, which lasted, on
average, 10.4 s per fly. Remarkably, this activity persisted after
the fly stopped ingesting 1 M sucrose (Figures 6A and 6B).
To explore the effects of hunger state and sucrose concen-
tration on IN1 responses and persistent activity, we measured
GCaMP6sfluorescenceinIN1neuronprocessesinfedandfasted
flies that were offered a single 20-nl drop of 1 M sucrose. 1 M su-
crose ingestion elicited significantly higher stimulus-evoked ac-
tivity in IN1 neurons in fasted compared to fed flies (Figures 6E–
6G). In fasted flies, 1 M sucrose-evoked activity of IN1 neurons
lasted for at least 7 min, decaying to 57% of the stimulus-evoked
maximum F/F0 (SEM: ±5.7). However in fed flies, this activity was
not sustained. When fasted flies ingested 100 mM sucrose, the
evoked GCaMP6s response was similar in amplitude to 1 M
sucrose ingestion, but the response was transient, with fluores-
cence quickly returning to baseline (Figure 6E). Thus, both hunger
state and sucrose concentration modulate IN1 activity.
If IN1 neurons regulate the intensity of sucrose ingestion in hun-
gry flies, IN1 activity should decrease steadily, as cumulative su-
crose ingestion satiates the fly. To test this hypothesis, we offered
24-hr-fasted flies 20-nl drops of 1 M sucrose repeatedly. In these
real-time sucrose ingestion/imaging experiments, the first inges-
tion event induced a large and persistent increase in GCaMP6s
activity in IN1 neurons (Figure 6H). Subsequent ingestion events
evoked neuronal activity on top of this elevated baseline. As the
experiment progressed, the fly became less likely to consume
the sucrose stimulus (Figure 6H). Initial full-volume ingestion
events transitioned into half-volume events and concluded with
a series of minute-volume or failed ingestions. In parallel, evoked
IN1 responses decreased across these trials (Figures 6H and 6I).
Activation of IN1 Suffices to Trigger Sucrose Ingestion
Fed flies ingest little or no food. If the activity of IN1 neurons reg-
ulates sucrose ingestion in hungry flies, artificial activation of
these neurons should suffice to trigger food ingestion in satiated
animals. We expressed the channelrhodopsin variant ReaChR
(Inagaki et al., 2014a) in sweet taste neurons or IN1 neurons (Fig-
ures S6A–S6C) and monitored behavior in response to photoac-
tivation. Photoactivation of sweet taste neurons (Gr5a>ReaChr)
reliably triggered robust proboscis extension that was tempo-
rally controlled by the light pulse (Figures 7A and 7B; Movie
S3). In contrast, IN1>ReaChR flies did not show proboscis
extension upon photoactivation when food was not present (Fig-
ures 7A and 7B). However, when flies were placed in close prox-
imity to a drop of 1 M sucrose (Figure S6D), photoactivation

 increased the probability of food ingestion in IN1>ReaChR flies,
but not in controls (Figures 7C–7H). Out of 15 IN1>ReaChr flies
tested, 11 exhibited intermittent ingestion throughout the light
stimulation period (Figure 7F). We estimated the ingested vol-
ume as the fly fed (Figures S6E and S6F). Photoactivation
increased the volume and duration of 1 M sucrose ingestion in
IN1>ReaChR flies but not in controls (Figures 7I and 7J). Light-
stimulated ingestion events of IN1>ReaChR flies were not time
locked to photoactivation. Instead, IN1 activation increased the
probability that flies ingest 1 M sucrose.
DISCUSSION
The neural circuits that integrate taste, hunger, and metabolism
to control food ingestion remain poorly understood (Dethier,

1976; Morton et al., 2006). We have
discovered 12 cholinergic interneurons in
the taste processing center of the fly brain
that tune the dynamics of sucrose inges-
tion. Our data support a model in which
sweet taste neurons in the pharynx proj-
ect to the subesophageal zone, where
they contact IN1 interneurons. When a
hungry animal first drinks sucrose, pharyngeal sweet taste neu-
rons are stimulated and activate IN1 neurons. In hungry flies, this
leads to persistent IN1 activity, which, in turn, sustains ingestion.
IN1 activity in fed flies or those offered a lower sucrose concen-
tration is attenuated, and these animals do not show sustained
ingestion. As the fly becomes satiated, IN1 neurons become
insensitive to sucrose, which decreases the drive to ingest,
and results in shorter ingestion episodes. We propose that the
IN1 circuit provides a fast feedback mechanism to regulate
sucrose ingestion by integrating taste and hunger signals.
Functional Characterization of a Drosophila Ingestion
Circuit
Although previous work investigating the dynamics of fly feeding
used proboscis extension as a proxy for food intake (Inagaki
Cell 165, 715–729, April 21, 2016
725
 et al., 2012, 2014b; Kain and Dahanukar, 2015; Marella et al.,
2012), this pre-ingestive response is not a reliable predictor of
ingestion (Deshpande et al., 2014). In classic work on the blowfly,
Vincent Dethier suggested that food consumption is controlled by
factors that stimulate ingestion rather than those that act on pe-
ripheral taste perception or post-ingestive nutrient sensing (Deth-
ier et al., 1956). Since IN1 neurons are activated when sucrose is
ingested, and their activity is modulated by both hunger state
and taste stimuli, they are uniquely situated to modulate ingestion.
In support of this, our functional imaging experiments revealed
that a single bout ofsucrose ingestion byhungry flies induced acti-
vation of IN1 neurons that persisted for at least 7 min. Long-lasting
changes in the activity of hypothalamic AgRP and POMC neurons
have been previously linked to the regulation of state-dependent
feeding decisions in mice (Betley et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2015).
Likewise, persistent neural activity in IN1 neurons may prepare
the nervous system in hungry flies for further food ingestion.
What are the origins of the persistent activity seen in IN1
neurons? Intrinsic or extrinsic factors may contribute. The area
where IN1 processes arborize receives input from dopaminergic,
serotonergic, and peptidergic afferents (data not shown). These
neuromodulatory circuits may be sensitive to satiety state (Albin
et al., 2015; Marella et al., 2012) and help to prolong IN1 activity
elicited by sucrose ingestion in fasted animals. It is plausible
that, once the fly reaches satiety, neuromodulatory activity is
tempered, and IN1 neurons return to their basal state. Alterna-
tively, IN1 neurons may have unique intrinsic biophysical fea-
tures that sustain their activity after sucrose stimulation. A
complete characterization of IN1 membrane excitability and
circuitry is necessary to investigate these ideas.
Connectivity in Feeding Circuits
Recent studies have identified a number of functionally distinct
populations of neurons in the fly taste circuit that regulate different
aspects of food intake behavior. Neuropeptide F and dopamine
signaling enhance the responsiveness of labellar taste sensory
neurons in hungry flies and increase the probability of initiating
food intake (Inagaki et al., 2012, 2014b; Marella et al., 2012). How-
ever, when labellar sweet taste perception is perturbed, ingestion
is not affected (LeDue et al., 2015). Thus, labellar taste neuron cir-
cuitry likely regulates initial food evaluation but not the later deci-
sion to ingest food. In contrast, IN1 activity is required specifically
to sustain sucrose ingestion. This makes IN1 neurons functionally
and anatomically distinct from all previously described neural
pathwaysthatmediatetasteresponsivenessandfeedinginitiation.
Previous work has identified interneurons that regulate the feeding
motor program (Flood et al., 2013), GABAergic neurons that sup-
press nonselective ingestion (Pool et al., 2014), and motor neurons
that regulate fluid ingestion (Manzo et al., 2012). How these neu-
rons connect taste sensory input to the motor output of ingestion
as well as interpret top-down information about hunger state is
not known. We propose that IN1 neurons participate in this
circuit as a key node that governs rapid food intake decisions.
A Conserved Mechanism for Ingestion Sensing via
Pharyngeal Taste?
In vertebrates, taste cells are present not only in the tongue but
also in other organs, including the pharynx (Henkin and Christi-
ansen, 1967; Ishimaru et al., 2005; Travers and Nicklas, 1990).
In zebrafish, the sweet taste receptors T1R2/T1R3 are ex-
pressed in the pharynx, as well as in the lip and gill raker (Ishi-
maru et al., 2005). Expression of T1R2/T1R3 in the pharynx
has not been investigated in mammals, but it is known that the
cranial nerve fibers innervating pharyngeal taste cells respond
to sugar (Frank, 1991; Hanamori et al., 1988). These neurons
project to the nucleus of solitary tract (NST) in the hindbrain (Car-
leton et al., 2010; Frank, 1991; Hanamori et al., 1988). The NST
also receives peripheral satiety signals transmitted via vagal
nerve fibers, indicating that this brain region is involved in
many regulatory processes that regulate food intake, including
the decision to continue ingestion (Carleton et al., 2010; Morton
et al., 2006). Based on the similarities of insect and vertebrate
taste-processing systems, we speculate that interneuron popu-
lations in the NST with the physiological properties of IN1 neu-
rons may exist. Taste perception by the pharynx would permit
rapid assessment of food intake volume and quality and provide
real-time feedback to the central brain to regulate ingestion in
vertebrates as well as in insects.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Detailed methods associated with all procedures discussed in the following
text are available in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Fly Strains
Simplified genotypes of fly strains are provided in the main text and figures for
clarity.
Behavior
All behavioral assays were carried out in a 23–25�C incubator, under a
12-hr:12-hr light:dark cycle (lights on at 9 a.m.) and 50%–60% relative humid-
ity, unless stated otherwise. All assays were performed at zeitgeber time 5–10
with 3- to 10-day-old males, unless stated otherwise.
CAFE Food Intake Screen
This assay was modified from earlier studies (Ja et al., 2007). To measure post-
fasting food intake, 24-hr-fasted flies were given access to liquid food for 3 hr.
For each genotype in the screen (Figure 3A), a group of ten flies was tested.
Locomotion Assay
Fly locomotion was tracked in a previously described custom-made 70-mm
circular arena (Simon and Dickinson, 2010) modified by Bussell et al. (2014),
with 10–15 flies per genotype tested.
Negative Geotaxis
This assay was modified from a previously described protocol (Stafford et al.,
2012).
Proboscis Extension
Procedures were modified from a previously described protocol (Shiraiwa and
Carlson, 2007).
Solid Food Intake
Ten flies were wet-fasted and then given access to solid food in a polystyrene
vial (Fisher #AS-519) for 15 min. Flies were scored as fully fed only if their
abdomen was completely filled with green food.
Expresso Feeding System
Assay hardware was designed and constructed in consultation with William
Dickson at IO Rodeo. The Expresso data analysis software was written in
MATLAB 2013a (MathWorks).
Photoactivation
IN1>ReaChR-expressing flies were raised on standard fly food at 25�C
and 50%–60% relative humidity in an incubator. 3- to 5-day-old male
flies were collected and housed in groups of 10–20 with food containing
400 mM all-trans-retinal (Sigma-Aldrich #R2500) mixed into standard fly
food. The flies were kept at 25�C and 50%–60% relative humidity in an
726
Cell 165, 715–729, April 21, 2016
 incubator in a light-protected box for 2–3 days before photoactivation
experiments.
Immunostaining and Microscopy
Samples were prepared essentially as described previously (Yu et al., 2010).
For details on procedures and antibodies used, see the Supplemental Exper-
imental Procedures.

Imaging
experiments
were
performed
as
previously
described
(Cohn
et al., 2015) on an Ultima two-photon laser-scanning microscope (Bruker
Nanosystems). The stimuli (water or sucrose) were presented to 24-hr-fasted
or -fed females that were head-fixed under the two-photon microscope.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with R version 3.1.3 (‘‘Smooth Sidewalk,’’
released March 9, 2015) (http://www.r-project.org/) and GraphPad Prism
Software version 6.0b (GraphPad Software).
