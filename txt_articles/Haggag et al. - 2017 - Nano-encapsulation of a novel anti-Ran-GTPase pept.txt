Abstract 
Ran is a small ras-related GTPase and is highly expressed in aggressive breast carcinoma.  
Overexpression induces malignant transformation and drives metastatic growth.  We have 
designed a novel series of anti-Ran-GTPase peptides, which prevents Ran hydrolysis and 
activation, and although they display effectiveness in silico, peptide activity is suboptimal in 
vitro due to reduced bioavailability and poor delivery.  To overcome this drawback, we 
delivered an anti-Ran-GTPase peptide using encapsulation in PLGA-based nanoparticles 
(NP).  Formulation variables within a double emulsion solvent evaporation technique were 
controlled to optimise physicochemical properties.  NP were spherical and negatively charged 
with a mean diameter of 182–277 nm.  Peptide integrity and stability were maintained after 
 3 
 
encapsulation and release kinetics followed a sustained profile.  We were interested in the 
relationship between cellular uptake and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) in the NP matrix, with 
results showing enhanced in vitro uptake with increasing PEG content.  Peptide-loaded, 
pegylated (10% PEG)-PLGA NP induced significant cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in 
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, with no evidence of similar effects in cells pulsed with 
free peptide.  Western blot analysis showed that encapsulated peptide interfered with the 
proposed signal transduction pathway of the Ran gene.  Our novel blockade peptide 
prevented Ran activation by blockage of regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1) 
following peptide release directly in the cytoplasm once endocytosis of the peptide-loaded 
nanoparticle has occurred.  RCC1 blockage was effective only when a nanoparticulate 
delivery approach was adopted.

1. Introduction 
Nanotechnologies offer promising approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of neoplastic 
disease, which remains a major on-going public health concern (Sharma et al., 2013).  
Effective delivery of the therapeutic agent often poses challenges, especially if it is peptide in 
nature and its site of action is inaccessible.  Furthermore, tumour metastasis is a predominant 
feature in many cancer-related deaths (Palmer et al., 2011), making complete disease 
remission and cure more difficult.  Therefore, an awareness and understanding of target 
pathways is essential to the development of novel therapeutics.  Specifically, recent studies 
show that Ran (Ras-related nuclear) protein is involved in growth regulation, apoptotic 
 4 
 
resistance, tumour transformation, increased aggressiveness and enhanced metastasis in a 
wide range of tumour types, such as breast, and is, therefore, a potential therapeutic target 
(Abe et al., 2008; Kurisetty et al., 2008; Ly et al., 2010; Xia et al., 2008; Yuen et al., 2012). 
Ran is a member of the Ras superfamily that regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport, 
mitotic spindle fibre assembly and post-mitotic nuclear envelope dynamics (Matchett et al., 
2014).  Ran acts as a molecular switch through a GTP-GDP cycle (Rush et al., 1996; Sazer, 
1996) in which the conversion between GTP-bound and GDP-bound conformations controls 
its interaction with different effectors (Scheffzek et al., 1995; Vetter et al., 1999).  Ran-GTP 
is formed inside the nucleus by interaction of Ran with its specific guanine nucleotide 
exchange factor (GEF), termed RCC1, which catalyses the exchange of GDP for GTP (and 
vice versa) on the nucleotide binding pocket of Ran (Bischoff and Ponstingl, 1991a; Bischoff 
and Ponstingl, 1991b; Ohtsubo et al., 1989; Renault et al., 2001).  Our group have shown that 
the interaction between Ran-GDP and RCC1 can be disrupted using different novel blockade 
peptides that inhibit competitively the binding of RCC1 to its specific binding pocket in the 
Ran-GDP conformation. 
In order to block Ran-GDP-dependent RCC1 function, our group have identified 
segments of the Ran protein sequence that are predicted to interact with RCC1 in the 
formation or stabilisation of the Ran-GDP-RCC1 complex.  We have designed a family of 
synthetic peptides designed to be biologically active, comprising a contiguous sequence of at 
least 6 amino acids and extending up to 25 amino acids (Patent Application GB1607593.9).  
In silico design enabled our group to deliver a predictable method for the generation of 
peptide inhibitors of the Ran-RCC1 interaction that are fragments of the natural Ran protein.  
However, our preliminary data have demonstrated that delivery of these anticancer 
therapeutic peptides to deep subcellular sites of action remains a substantial challenge due to 
 5 
 
poor cellular distribution, lack of selective delivery and multidrug resistance.  These findings 
are shared with the delivery of many other therapeutic peptides (Brigger et al., 2002). 
The development of peptide-based therapeutics has had promising results (Thayer, 
2011), both in terms of efficacy and targeting specificity (Aina et al., 2002; Enbäck and 
Laakkonen, 2007; Vlieghe et al., 2010).  Biodegradable polyester matrices, in particular, 
feature in many innovative approaches evaluated over the past four decades.  Formulations 
based on PLGA matrices have secured FDA approval in the treatment of advanced prostate 
and breast cancers (West et al., 1987).  Similarly, FDA approval is in place for other peptide 
drugs incorporated within polymeric carriers, such as leuprolide acetate indicated for the 
treatment of advanced prostate and breast cancers (Sethi and Sanfilippo, 2009), and a 
controlled release formulation based on octreotide acetate-loaded PLGA for tumour treatment 
in neuroendocrine disorders and carcinoid syndrome (Anthony and Freda, 2009).  A PLGA-
based microparticle formulation of triptorelin pamoate used for advanced prostate cancer and 
other indications, was given regulatory approval in 2000 (Crawford and Phillips, 2011).  
However, the formidable barrier to effective peptide transport across the cell membrane 
remains.  Lipid-based nanocarriers and colloidal nanoparticles (NP) are often used to 
encapsulate biologically active drugs, such as peptides, proteins and DNA, and to enhance 
cell penetration (Angelov et al., 2012; Angelova et al., 2013a; Angelova et al., 2013b; 
Angelova et al., 2015; Angelova et al., 2011; Borghouts et al., 2005).  Polymeric NP made 
from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) are especially beneficial (Haggag and Faheem, 
2015; Kamaly et al., 2012). 
PLGA NP are fabricated using a range of techniques (Jain, 2000), with the emulsion-
solvent evaporation technique frequently used to encapsulate small molecular weight 
compounds, like peptides, and high molecular weight DNA or antisense oligonuclotides 
(Labhasetwar, 1997).  Given the unique nature of our novel anti-Ran-GTPase blockade 
 6 
 
peptide, the first aim was to adjust formulation parameters in a emulsion-solvent evaporation 
technique, such as the PEG fraction in the polymer matrix, peptide loading and volume of 
external aqueous phase.  This would evaluate, for the first time, how the presence of our 
peptide would affect properties, such as mean particulate size and its distribution.  The 
second aim was to maximise the encapsulation efficiency of our peptide, designed 
specifically to interact with and deactivate Ran-GTP, and assess stability and release.  The 
third aim of the work was to investigate the effectiveness of cellular uptake and evaluate 
interaction between the blockade peptide and the Ran gene in a breast cancer cell line (MDA-
MB-231), which is characterised by Ran overexpression. 
 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1 Materials 
PLGA with a 50:50 lactic:glycolic ratio (Resomer® RG 503H, MW 34 kDa) and two PLGA-
co-PEG block copolymers (Resomer® RGP d 5055 (5% PEG of MW 5 kDa) and Resomer® 
RGP d 50105 (10% PEG of 5 kDa molecular weight)) were purchased from Sigma Chemical 
Co. (St. Louis, USA).  An anti-Ran-GTPase blockade peptide (CAQGEPQVQFK, composed 
of 11 amino acids with a molecular formula of C53H83N15O17S, a purity of ≥ 94%, molecular 
weight 1234 Da, and estimated good water solubility) was synthesised by GL-Biochem Ltd. 
(Shanghai, China).  Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, 87-89% hydrolysed, molecular weight 31,000-
50,000) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. 
Louis, USA).  A modified Lowry Protein Assay kit was obtained from Pierce Ltd. (Rockford, 
IL).  Dichloromethane, acetonitrile and triflouroacetic acid were of HPLC grade and other 
reagents were of analytical grade.  Water used in the work was produced to Type 1 standard 
(Milli-Q®, 18.2 MΩ cm at 25 °C). 
 7 
 
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from Prof. Mohamed El-Tanani 
(Institute of Cancer Therapeutics, Bradford University) and grown in Dulbecco's modified 
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmol 
l-1 L-glutamine, 100 U ml-1 of penicillin and 100 μg ml-1 streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, 
CA, USA) at 37 ºC in humidified 95% air and 5% CO2 with medium changed after each 
three-day interval. 
 
2.2 Preparation of peptide-loaded NP 
A modified, double emulsion, solvent evaporation method (Haggag et al., 2016) was used in 
this study.  Anti-Ran-GTPase blockade peptide was dissolved in 0.2 ml of internal aqueous 
phase (Table 1) and mixed with 2.0 ml dichloromethane (DCM) containing 5% w/v polymer, 
then emulsified at 6,000 rpm (Silverson L5T, Silverson Machines, UK) for 2 minutes.  The 
primary emulsion (w/o) was injected directly into a 1.25% w/v PVA solution under agitation 
and emulsification continued at 10,000 rpm for a further 6 minutes to produce a double 
emulsion, using the same conditions of homogenisation.  The final emulsion was stirred by 
magnetic agitation overnight under vacuum to evaporate the organic solvent.  After the 
nanospheres had formed, they were centrifuged at 22,000 g for 30 minutes at 4 °C, which was 
sufficient to pellet the NP.  The pellet was washed three times with ultrapure water, washed 
once with 2% w/v sucrose solution and lyophilised (Labconco, Kansas city, Missouri).  
Samples were stored in a desiccator at ambient temperature before further use. 
To make fluorescent peptide-loaded NP, coumarin 6 (100 µg) was added to the DCM 
phase, as the only change to the procedure described above.  NP containing coumarin 6 were 
evaluated with respect to the drug-loading efficiency, particle size, polydispersity index (PDI) 
and zeta potential.  Process variables, such as the PEG content, peptide loading, volume of 
 8 
 
external aqueous phase and composition of the internal aqueous phase are listed in Table 1, 
together with the identifying code used to define each NP formulation. 
 
2.3 NP Characterisation 
Lyophilised NP samples (5.0 mg) were suspended in Milli-Q water to a suitable 
concentration to give the recommended scattering intensity of 100,000 counts per second.  
The mean diameter and size distribution were analysed by photon correlation spectroscopy 
(PCS) at a fixed angle of 90° using a Malvern Zetasizer 5000 (Malvern Instruments, UK).  
All measurements were performed in triplicate.  Surface charge was quantified as zeta 
potential using laser Doppler anemometry (Malvern Zetasizer 5000, Malvern Instruments, 
UK).  Lyophilised samples were diluted with 0.001 M KCl.  Zeta potentials were calculated 
from the mean value of electrophoretic mobility by applying the Smoluchowski equation.  All 
measurements were performed in triplicate.  NP surface morphology was studied using 
scanning electron microscopy (FEI Quanta 400 FEG SEM).  Powder samples were mounted 
on to metal stubs, then coated with a gold layer under vacuum before scanning. 
 
2.4 Determination of peptide loading, encapsulation efficiency and concentration 
Peptide loading was determined by direct extraction from lyophilised NP following common 
solvent dissolution using dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).  Freeze-dried NP (10 mg) were 
weighed accurately, dissolved in 1.0 ml DMSO and added to a solution of 0.1 N NaOH 
containing 0.5% SDS.  After standing for 1 hour at room temperature, the suspension became 
transparent.  The peptide concentration was measured by the Lowry method (Fude et al., 
2005), giving the percentage loading (w/w, peptide mass per unit mass of dry NP).  
Comparison of the actual peptide loading with the theoretical peptide loading gave the 
percentage encapsulation efficiency.  Each sample was assayed in triplicate. 
 9 
 
The concentration of free peptide obtained during release studies was determined 
using HPLC.  Reverse phase chromatography (Alcock et al., 2002) (Phenomenex- Luna® 
C18-5 column mm, 5 µm) running at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min-1 with UV detection (254 nm) 
was used.  A mobile phase elution gradient was established, comprising two solvent mixtures 
(solvent A 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile; solvent B 0.1% TFA in water).   
 
2.5 In vitro release studies 
A sample of peptide-loaded NP (5.0 mg) was suspended in 1.0 ml PBS (pH 7.4) solution and 
incubated at 37 °C with agitation using a reciprocal shaking water bath (100 rpm).  Samples 
were taken at predetermined time intervals of 1, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 hours, 
replaced with fresh PBS, centrifuged for 5 minutes at 22,000 g and the peptide concentration 
in the supernatant determined in triplicate by HPLC assay. 
 
2.6 Assessment of peptide integrity  
The stability of encapsulated peptide following formulation and release from polymeric NP 
was determined after 7 days of in vitro release.  The aqueous release medium containing 
peptide was analysed immediately using HPLC-MS (Applied Biosystems API 4000 
LC/MS/MS).  The mobile phase, at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min-1, comprised a linear gradient of 
solvent B (0.1% TFA in acetonitrile) in solvent A (0.1% TFA in water) over a run time of 30 
minutes.  About 10–20 μl of the sample was separated using a C18 reversed phase column.  
The XCALIBUR® software package (Thermo scientific, USA) was used for data acquisition 
and analysis. 
 
 10 
 
2.7 Seeding of MDA-MB-231 cells 
MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested, once confluent, and the suspension centrifuged at 1200 
rpm (4 °C) for 5 minutes to sediment the cells.  The pellet was re-suspended in complete 
growth medium (DMEM (high glucose), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.1 mM MEM Non-
Essential Amino Acids (NEAA), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% Pen-Strep).  A cell count was 
performed on a sample of suspension (10 μl) using a haemocytometer. 
 
2.8 Cellular uptake of NP 
Cellular uptake of coumarin 6-loaded NP formulations was evaluated using flow cytometry 
and fluorescence microscopy (Pamujula et al., 2012).  Briefly, 1.5 × 105 MDA-MB31 cells 
were seeded onto 6-well tissue culture plates in 2.0 ml complete growth medium one day 
before the experiment.  For FACS analysis, coumarin 6-tagged NP (F16, 17 and F18) were 
suspended in Optimem® media and added to MDA-MB-231 cells for 24 hours in 6-well 
plates.  Cells were removed by trypsinisation and resuspended in FACS buffer.  Cellular 
uptake of NP was quantified by gating for positive couramin 6 staining in the FITC channel 
following control staining with coumarin 6-treated and unstained MDA-MB-231 cells.  Three 
independent experiments with three replicates were performed for each assay. 
Cellular uptake and cellular localisation of the peptide-loaded NP were evaluated 
qualitatively by fluorescence microscopy using analysis of five fields per well.  Intracellular 
uptake of coumarin 6-loaded NP (F18) into MDA-MB-231 cells was detected using 
fluorescence imaging 24 hours after treatment (Olympus IX70).  The images were captured 
using digital photography (Olympus DP-71, Olympus, Centre Valley, PA, USA).  MDA-MB-
231 cells where seeded into a 6-well plate, containing two fixed cover slips and 2.0 ml of 
growth medium.  After washing cells with sterile PBS, the coverslips were removed, mounted 
with fixing media over a glass slide and examined.  The untreated MDA-MB-231 cells and 
 11 
 
cells treated with a solution of coumarin 6 were used as positive and negative controls, 
respectively. 
 
2.9 Cytotoxicity studies 
Cytotoxicity of an optimised peptide-loaded NP formulation (F18) was measured by 
assessing cell viability (MTT assay). MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in 24-well plates 
(Nalgen Nunc International, Ochester, NY) at a density of 5x104 cells suspended in 0.5 ml 
media per well and incubated for 24 hours to allow for 60-70% confluency and sufficient 
adhesion.  Cells were treated with 1.0 ml of transfection medium containing different 
concentrations of peptide (2.0 M, 4.0 M and 8.0 M) in either free form or encapsulated in 
NP.  Encapsulation efficiency data was used to determine the required mass of peptide-loaded 
NP needed to maintain peptide equivalency to the free peptide solutions.  As a control 
experiment, cells were exposed to a concentration of blank NP equivalent to the highest 
concentration of peptide-loaded NP used. 
After 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours, the treated cells were washed with 500 µl PBS and 500 
µl of 15% MTT dye solution in complete media.  The plates were incubated at 37 °C and 5% 
CO2 for an additional 3 hours.  The supernatant was discarded and MTT-formazan crystals 
formed by metabolically viable cells dissolved in 500 μl of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).  The 
optical density of each well was measured at 570 nm (reference wavelength 630 nm) in a 
microplate reader (Fluostar Omega, BMG Lab Tech GMBH, Germany).  This experiment 
was performed in triplicate and repeated three times.  Mean values ± standard deviation (SD) 
for each concentration were determined.  Percentage cell viability was determined as the ratio 
of absorbance (570 nm) in treated cells relative to the absorbance in control cells (570 nm).  
The absorbance of the untreated cells was set at 100%.  The IC50 was defined as the 
concentration of sample needed to reduce the signal by 50% relative to the control. 
 12 
 
 
2.10 Cell cycle analysis 
To determine the effect of peptide-loaded NP on cell growth, cultured cells were treated with 
the same doses of free peptide and peptide-loaded NP as used in the cell viability assay.  
MDA-MB31 cells (1.5 × 105) were seeded onto 6-well tissue culture plates in 2 ml complete 
growth medium one day before the experiment.  After 24 and 48 hours of treatment, cells 
were suspended in PBS and fixed by addition of 70% ice-cold ethanol.  Cells were treated by 
adding RNase (1.0 µg ml-1) to the samples and resuspending in propidium iodide (PI) stain 
(5.0 µg ml-1).  Cellular DNA content was analysed (FACS Calibur, BD Biosciences) using 
approximately 10,000 cells for each analysis.  The distribution of cells in each phase of the 
cell cycle was displayed in histogram format.  Flow-cytometric data were analysed using 
Cyflogic (v.1.2.1) software.  Quantification of apoptotic cells was determined as the 
percentage of cells in the sub-G1 region (hypodiploidy) in cell cycle analysis, as previously 
described (Looi et al., 2011).  The assay was repeated at least twice and the treatments were 
tested in duplicate. 
 
2.11 Ran activation assay 
MDA-MB31 cells (1.5 × 105) were seeded onto 6-well tissue culture plates in 2.0 ml 
complete growth medium one day before the experiment commenced.  Measurement of Ran 
activity was captured using a Ran activation assay kit (Yuen et al., 2013) (Cell Biolabs, San 
Diego, CA) and used according to the manufacturer instructions.  This Ran activation assay is 
used to visualise a Ran-GTP band, which means Ran is in its active form.  It utilises RanBP1 
agarose beads to isolate selectively and pull-down the active form of Ran from purified 
samples or endogenous lysates.  Subsequently, precipitated Ran-GTP was detected by 
western blot analysis using an anti-Ran antibody. 
 13 
 
The Ran activation assay was performed by immunoprecipitation using anti–Ran 
binding protein 1 (RanBP1) antibody, which binds only to Ran-GTP in MDA-MB-231 cells.  
The resultant pull-down eluents were than analysed by immunoblotting for Ran.  Four cell 
lysates were used, derived from (i) control cells, (ii) cells treated with blank NP, (iii) cells 
treated with free peptide and (iv) cells treated with peptide-loaded NP.  Each cell lysate type 
was subjected to positive and negative controls. 
 
2.12 Statistical analysis 
Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and analysed statistically using one-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post hoc test.  A value of p < 0.05 
was considered statistically significant.

3. Results and Discussion 
The physicochemical parameters of polymeric NP loaded with peptide, such as mean particle 
size, PDI, zeta potential and encapsulation efficiency are shown in Table 2.  Optimisation 
was achieved by simultaneously minimising mean size and maximising peptide loading. 
 
3.1 Effect of Polymer type 
The effect of increasing PEG content in the PLGA backbone on physicochemical 
characterisation can be seen by comparing F1, F4 and F7.  PLGA NP (F1) (330.0 ± 20.1 nm) 
were significantly larger in size (p < 0.001) than NP prepared from PEGylated polymers of 
F4 (250.2 ± 12.8 nm) and F7 (217.3 ± 11.1 nm) for 5 and 10% PEG-PLGA diblock 
copolymers, respectively (Fig. 1A).  Covalently linked hydrophilic PEG blocks modify 
PLGA, producing smaller particles (Rojnik et al., 2012).  All NP formulations were of low 
polydispersity index ranging from 0.26 to 0.39.  Increasing the PEG fraction in the NP matrix 
resulted in a decrease in the mean NP diameter, which is a similar finding to that reported in 
other studies (Haggag et al., 2016). 
 
The zeta potential of NP plays an important role in stability.  F1 exhibited higher 
negative ζ-potential values (-18.9 ± 2.6 mV) compared to the PEGylated PLGA NP (F4 and 
F7) (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1B).  Increasing the PEG fraction from 5% to 10% had no further effect.  
The PEG-PLGA NP had a lower negative zeta potential, relatively close to neutral, due to the 
presence of surface-located PEG chains that shield free carboxylic groups responsible for the 
overall negative particulate surface charge (Xiao et al., 2010). 
Increasing PEG fraction in the polymer backbone resulted in a significant increase in 
peptide entrapment (p < 0.01).  Encapsulation efficiency was increased from 37.0% ± 2.2% in 
PLGA to 54.9% ± 2.6% in 10% PEG-PLGA (Fig. 1C).  In the diblock types, PEG chains 
orient themselves towards the aqueous phase in micelles, surrounding the encapsulated 
 15 
 
peptide (Tobio et al., 1998).  Hydrophilic microenvironments created by these PEG segments, 
produce regions that encapsulated peptide can occupy (Haggag et al., 2016), which facilitated 
high drug loading and encapsulation efficiency.  Additionally, the higher encapsulation 
efficiency of 10% PEG-PLGA is due to its lower solubility in methylene chloride, which 
shortens solidification time and enhances encapsulation (Mehta et al., 1996). 
The in vitro release profile showed that the burst release of peptide was faster and 
significantly higher (p < 0.001) from PEGylated PLGA NP when compared to PLGA NP.  F4 
and F7 released approximately 62.6% ± 2.5% and 70.4% ± 6% of peptide within the first 24 
hours compared to 51.5% ± 1.5% released from F1 (Fig. 1D).  Although release of peptide 
from PLGA NP was sustained over the experimental period, the PEGylated PLGA NP 
showed faster release of peptide immediately after incubation with release medium.  Release 
then became slower, with approximately 90% of peptide released over 7 days in the 
PEGylated PLGA NP.  Higher burst release can be attributed to peptide attached to the 
surface of the PEGylated PLGA NP.  Moreover, hydrophilic PEG chains allowed faster 
release of the peptide through enhanced polymer degradation rate because water was taken up 
more readily when compared to PLGA NP (Locatelli and Comes Franchini, 2012).  Overall, 
it can be concluded that PEGylation significantly affected physicochemical properties, such 
as size, shape, surface charge and surface hydrophobicity.  These factors are known to 
influence NP uptake and biological activity in organ and tissue structures. 
 
3.2 Effect of External aqueous phase volume 
Three different external phase volumes (50, 75 and 100 ml) were used in this study to make 
NP comprising PLGA (F1, F2 and F3), 5% PEG-PLGA (F4, F5 and F6) and 10% PEG-
PLGA (F7, F8 and F9).  An increase in volume from 50 ml to 100 ml caused an insignificant 
increase in size (p > 0.05) of the PLGA NP (Fig. 2A) with a significant increase (p < 0.001) 
 16 
 
in PDI from 0.26 ± 0.04 to 0.45 ± 0.02.  However, a slight increase in PDI with a significant 
increase in size from 250 nm to 325 nm and from 217 nm to 274 nm was observed for 5% 
and 10% PEGylated PLGA NP, respectively.  Conversely, the increase in external PVA 
solution to 100 ml resulted in a significant increase in size (p < 0.01) of 5% and 10% 
PEGylated PLGA NP from 250.3 ± 12.8 nm to 325.5 ± 27 nm and from 217.3 ± 11.1 nm to 
274.8 ± 19.6  nm for 5% and 10% PEGylated PLGA NP, respectively.  However, an 
insignificant decrease in PDI values (p > 0.05) was observed.  A possible explanation is that 
increasing the external aqueous phase volume, resulted in reduced shear forces during the 
second emulsification step and, hence, reduced the mixing or dispersion efficiency needed to 
break the emulsion droplets effectively.  This yielded larger emulsion droplets, which finally 
led to larger NP (Li, 1999).  The reduced mixing can also explain the increase in PDI values. 
Preparation of peptide-loaded NP with different volumes of the external aqueous 
phase had no significant effect on zeta potential (p > 0.05) (Fig. 2B).  Encapsulation 
efficiency increased as the volume of the continuous phase increased (Fig. 2C).  For example, 
when the ratio of dispersed phase to continuous phase (DP/CP) was decreased to 1/50, the 
encapsulation efficiency significantly increased (p < 0.05) by a factor of 36.9% (PLGA), 
31.5% (5% PEG-PLGA) and 24.6% (10% PEG-PLGA) when compared to the higher DP/CP 
ratio of 1/25.  It was likely that a large volume of continuous phase provides nearly a sink 
condition for diluting the organic solvent so that DCM was extracted promptly, resulting in 
fast solidification of the polymer that eventually led to higher entrapment (Mehta et al., 
1996).  In vitro release profiles showed that external phase volume influenced release, but 
PEGylation had a more pronounced effect.  The profiles in Fig. 2D illustrate how volume 
variation affects release as polymer type is held constant (5% PEG-PLGA removed for 
clarity).  For low external volume, the solidification process is expected to be slower.  Water 
is then able to influx from either the aqueous phase (external and internal) into the polymer 
 17 
 
structure, which creates water-filled channels or pores.  Polymer solidification is expected to 
be faster for larger external volumes, as DCM is extracted more effectively.  In such cases, a 
less porous structure is expected and release is slower (Jiang et al., 2002).  It can be 
concluded that the external aqueous phase volume can be used to optimise NP 
physicochemical properties by controlling the NP size, encapsulation efficiency and in vitro 
release, which are essential parameters for effective nanoparticulate therapeutics. 
 
3.3 Effect of peptide loading 
Three different peptide loadings were used in this study (6%, 4% and 2%), as shown in Fig. 
3.  Decreasing peptide loading resulted in a non-significant decrease in the size of PLGA NP 
(p > 0.05) (Fig. 3A).  However, decreasing the peptide loading from 6% to 2% in PEG-PLGA 
formulations resulted in a significant decrease in NP size (p < 0.001).  NP size decreased 
from 325.5 ± 27 nm to 178.5 ± 25.7 nm and from 274.8 ± 19.6 nm to 161.8 ± 15.7 nm for 5% 
and 10% PEGylated NP, respectively.  It is feasible that increasing the peptide loading 
increased the amount bound to the NP surface due to the presence of PEG moieties.  But 
given that the amount of peptide in comparison to the total polymer is low, increases in 
loading from 2% to 6% are unlikely to push much more peptide to the surface.  Furthermore, 
the zeta potential data in Fig. 3B show no evidence of charge shielding from increasing 
surface peptide.  It is feasible that these results highlight a different peptide packing 
mechanism in the NP matrix when PEGylated PLGA types are compared to PLGA-only 
matrices. 
PDI values reduced following a decrease in peptide loading, with no significant effect 
on the surface charge (Fig. 3B).  Peptide loading had a significant impact of on the 
encapsulation efficiency in all types of NP.  The decrease in peptide loading resulted in a 
significant increase in encapsulation efficiency (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3C).  Of particular interest are 
 18 
 
the optimised encapsulation efficiencies observed for 10% PEG-PLGA NP, which increased 
from 68.4% ± 2.1% to 80.5% ± 6.1%. 
The release profiles and the initial bursts were closely related to the degree of peptide 
loading (Fig.3D).  The release profile of F3, F6 and F9 with a loading of 2% was significantly 
lower than those of 6% loading (p < 0.01).  Initial bursts of 41.4% ± 2.2%, 52.5% ± 3.2% and 
59.4% ± 2.0% were observed from F3, F6 and F9, respectively, compared to 31.5% ± 1.0%, 
40.3% ± 1.5% and 45.5% ± 1.5% from F11, F13 and F15, respectively.  Using increased 
amounts of peptide in the primary emulsion droplets enhanced the concentration gradient 
acting towards the external water phase, which led to increased outward diffusion (Lamprecht 
et al., 2000).  Moreover, there is likely to be more peptide distributed near the NP surface, 
especially for PEGylated PLGA NP.  The diffusion of surface-associated peptide facilitated 
the formation of water-filled channels that allow subsequent elution of the remaining peptide 
located inside the NP.  This leads to a greater initial release (Yang et al., 2001). 
 
3.4 Effect of peptide charge 
In this study, peptide was dissolved in two aqueous solvent types (PBS and 0.1 M HCl pH 
1.0) to investigate the effect of electrostatic interaction on the physicochemical 
characterisation of different NP formulations of PLGA (F11 and F16), 5% PEG-PLGA (F13 
and F17) and 10% PEG-PLGA (F15 and F18).  Anti-Ran-GTPase peptide is a neutral peptide 
with an isoelectric point (pI ) around 6.0 (Gasteiger E., 2005).  Peptide dissolved in PBS is 
unlikely to interact with the PLGA.  However, in 0.1 M HCl, the peptide is cationic and an 
objective in this part of the study was to investigate interaction with uncapped carboxylic acid 
terminal end groups. 
The predicted peptide-polymer interaction had no significant impact on NP size and 
PDI (Fig. 4A), although there was evidence that it influenced the zeta potential (p > 0.05) 
 19 
 
(Fig. 4B).  Conversely, interaction between peptide and polymer contributed to increasing 
encapsulation efficiency, which was observed in all polymer types.  However, a sharp 
increase in peptide encapsulation efficiency was observed for PLGA (p < 0.001), which 
exceeded that for the other PEGylated polymers (Fig. 4C).  The abundance of free carboxyl 
groups, which are more prevalent in PLGA, would explain this observation.  Interestingly, 
the free carboxyl group is not expected to be charged in DCM or 0.1 M HCl, as used in this 
work, but there is evidence of an interaction that enhances encapsulation, as seen in Fig. 4C. 
This interaction would retard peptide diffusivity to the external aqueous phase during the 
preparation process and impede unwanted loss (Fude et al., 2005).  Encapsulation of cationic 
peptides within uncapped polymers that carry free carboxylic end groups is preferable to the 
end-capped variants. 
In vitro release profiles of PLGA NP showed a reduced initial burst release phase, 
when compared to profiles in Fig 1D, followed by a slower release profile during the 
remainder of the incubation period (Fig. 4D).  Strong interactions between polymer and 
peptide are predicted to influence release from the final delivery system (Kim and Park, 
1999).  Indeed, further work done in this study with alteration in the ionic strength of the 
release medium (data not shown) was able to reverse the reduction of release rates.  Increases 
in ionic strength of the medium reduces the extent of ionic interaction by shielding charged 
groups (Park et al., 1998).  These results support a peptide release mechanism from PLGA 
NP that is not only controlled by degradation or erosion of the polymer, but also due to the 
possible electrostatic interactions.  This reduction in initial burst is viewed as advantageous, 
as it minimises the risk of premature in vivo release.  A nanoparticulate system intended for 
cytosolic delivery must reach that location before significant drug release has occurred. 
Although interactions of the type described above may adapt the release rate in a 
favourable way, there is risk that stability of the peptide is adversely affected.  Structural 
 20 
 
stability was assured by mass spectroscopic data, which confirmed that the peptide mass was 
unaltered following in vitro release after seven days from F18 (Fig. 5A).  Furthermore, HPLC 
data did not show changes in retention time during the same time period. 
 
3.5 Scanning electron microscopy 
To access the surface morphology, aggregation or adhesion of peptide-loaded NP (F18), SEM 
was used to visualise the particulate surface.  SEM images revealed a smooth spherical shape 
of homogenous size, with no evidence of particle adhesion or aggregation (Fig 5B).  The 
average size obtained from SEM was comparable to what obtained by laser diffraction.  After 
7 days of in vitro release, exhausted NP samples appeared to have a more porous and 
labyrinthine structure.  This structure would result from drug diffusion after the erosion of the 
polymer by the aqueous release media (Haggag et al., 2016) (Fig. 5C). 
 
3.6 Cellular uptake of nanoparticles 
An objective of this study was to investigate the efficiency of cellular uptake of PLGA and 
PEGylated PLGA NP by MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells. Quantitative flow cytometry 
analysis, after 24 hours of treatment, showed that the percentage of cells with positive 
staining following treatment with 10% PEGylated NP was significantly higher (p < 0.001) 
than all other NP formulations made from PLGA and 5% PEG-PLGA.  F18 induced the best 
cellular uptake with 54.8% ± 12.7% positive cells, compared to 11.4% ± 3.7% and 18.1% ± 
7.3% for F16 and F17, respectively.  These results showed that F18, with the lowest particle 
size (162 nm), highest PEG content and lowest zeta potential (−4.5 mV) gave rise to the 
greatest uptake by MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 6).  Quantitative uptake data for F18 clearly 
demonstrated its superiority over other formulations, such as F16 and F17, and so this 
formulation was investigated further. 
 21 
 
Fluorescence microscopy studies provided limited evidence of F18 uptake in MDA-
MB-231 cells (Fig. 7).  It is possible that fixation, as used in this work, may have contributed 
to this low level of visual data (Richard et al., 2003).  However, peptide-loaded NP were seen 
to be primarily localised in the cytoplasmic compartment, while some fluorescence intensity 
was observed in the perinuclear region (Fig. 7G-7I).  Coumarin 6 uptake from solution 
showed minimal internalisation (Fig. 7D-7F).  The efficiency of cellular internalisation of 
nanoparticles is known to be dependent on their diameter (Kamaly et al., 2012) and for the 
purposes of tumour accumulation, the upper limit for extravasation into solid tumours is 
suggested to be approximately 400 nm.  It is generally observed that NP below 200 nm 
accumulate effectively within tumour tissue, with the 70–200 nm range considered optimal 
for tumour passive targeting (Torchilin, 2007).  Therefore, the diameter observed for F18 fits 
well within this optimal range.  
The benefits of PEG on prolonging circulation time of colloidal carriers are well 
known (Cruje and Chithrani, 2015), but in this study, however, it is the role of PEG as a 
component part of the particulate matrix on cellular uptake that is of particular importance.  
Its effect is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 6 and, based on quantitative and qualitative results, it 
was concluded that 10% PEGylated PLGA NP showed optimised cellular uptake. This 
finding is generally supported in the literature (Pamujula et al., 2012), where increasing levels 
of PEG gives rise to NP with favourable characteristics, such as enhanced internalisation.  
There are reports that contradict this finding and propose that PEG will repel nanocarriers 
from the cell surface (Pelaz et al., 2015).  On balance, the results of this current study support 
the enhanced internalisation effect.  Moreover, localisation of peptide-loaded NP in the 
cytoplasm, where Ran GDP is localised, is desirable as it is the most effective site for 
delivery of the blockade peptide. Successful translocation of NP from endosome to cytoplasm 
is an essential demand of any polymer-mediated drug delivery system as bio-therapeutics 
 22 
 
must be localised in the cytosol to exert functional activity. The need of NP to escape the 
endosome prior to fusion with lysosomes is the most important step in reaching the desired 
subcellular compartments (Whitehead et al., 2009).  Reversal of the surface charge of related 
PLGA NP via transfer of protons/hydronium ions by the aid of acidic pH of endo-lysosomes 
is the proposed mechanism for endo-lysosomal escape (Makino et al., 1986).  Based on 
cellular uptake results in the test cell line, F18 was selected for further studies. 
 
3.7 In vitro cytotoxicity and cell cycle analysis 
The cytotoxic action of peptide-loaded NP on the MDA-MB-231 cell line was evaluated 
using MTT assay after 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours of treatment at 2, 4 and 8 µM of free peptide 
and peptide-loaded NP (F18).  Dose effect curves were used to detect the drug concentration 
that caused 50% growth inhibition (IC50).  The results showed that the blank NP and free 
peptide had no cytotoxicity on breast cancer cells within the concentration range used (Fig. 
8).  Peptide-loaded NP reduced cell viability and a sustained cytotoxic action was achieved 
for up to four days after treatment.  The mean IC50 value for peptide-loaded 10% PEG-PLGA 
NP in MDA-MB-231 cells was 3.6 µM, which was achieved within 24 hours.  Based on these 
findings, the free peptide does not achieve any cytotoxic effect, which confirms our previous 
findings.  This is due to poor delivery to the site of action or possible degradation.  However, 
NP were able to deliver peptide to its subcellular site, protected it from degradation and 
induced cytotoxicity, mostly likely by deactivation of Ran-GTP formation. 
The results of cell cycle analysis showed that cells treated with peptide-loaded NP 
were arrested at the mitotic division stage of the G0/G1 and G2/M phase.  Peptide-loaded NP 
showed a stronger effect after 48 hours.  Peptide-loaded NP at concentrations of 4 and 8 µM 
caused significantly higher G0/G1 phase arrest of 31.2% and 55.4% after 48 hours, compared 
to results after 24 hours of 14.2% and 37.7%, respectively, using similar concentrations (Fig. 
 23 
 
9).  Concomitantly, the growth rate of the cells was also reduced after peptide-loaded NP 
treatment, whereas cells treated with free peptide were not affected.  This confirmed the 
peptide blockade effect on Ran by inhibition of Ran-GTP formation and its role in cell 
mitosis. 
 
3.8 Ran activation assay 
Ran regulates molecular events by cycling between an inactive GDP-bound form and an 
active GTP-bound form.  In its active (GTP-bound) state, Ran binds specifically to RanBP1 
to control downstream signaling cascades.  These results led us to investigate if the peptide 
delivered from the loaded NP is specifically inhibiting Ran activation by preventing its 
conversion from Ran-GDP to Ran-GTP.  The important band to note in Fig. 10 is lane 5 in 
panel B, which is the lysate of cells treated with peptide-loaded NP.  There is clear evidence 
of inhibition of Ran-GTP formation which is the active form (2.5 fold decrease) when 
compared to free peptide- treated cells (lane 2 in panel B).  These results confirm that our 
anti-Ran-GTPase peptide is delivered effectively to the cytoplasm and retains it functional 
interaction with Ran-GDP, causing subsequent inhibition of Ran activation. 
 
 
Conclusions 
There is accumulating evidence that Ran is overexpressed in breast tumours and high levels 
lead to increased cancer cell invasion and metastasis in vivo.  Developing novel Ran targeted 
therapies, such as an anti-Ran-GTPase peptide, is an attractive therapeutic approach.  Due to 
the poor bioavailability and ineffective delivery of naked Ran interfering peptides, we sought 
to improve delivery by NP encapsulation.  Optimisation of the physicochemical properties of 
peptide-loaded NP can directly affect its physical stability, drug release, cellular uptake and 
 24 
 
the therapeutic activity.  Low peptide loading, low DP/CP ratio and peptide polymer ionic 
interaction resulted in the formulation of spherical, peptide-loaded NP with high 
encapsulation efficiency, low size range, low PDI and a low negative zeta potential providing 
more rapid intracellular entry.  Mass spectroscopy revealed that the peptide was incorporated 
and released from the NP without altering its molecular weight.  The therapeutic efficacy of 
the peptide-loaded NP largely depended on the availability at the intracellular site of action.  
Our results from intracellular uptake studies demonstrated a rapid and pronounced cellular 
uptake of PEGylated NP, due mostly to the presence of PEG, resulting in increased 
preferential cytotoxicity in a model cancer cell line.  Peptide-loaded NP exhibited an IC50 at a 
low dose of 3.6 µM in breast cancer cells.  Free peptide had a negligible cytotoxic effect on 
cells, confirming the peptide displayed preferential sensitivity once intracellular delivery was 
facilitated.  Nanoparticles encapsulating the anti-Ran peptide inhibited Ran-GTP formation 
which is essential for tumorigenesis and metastasis.  Peptide-loaded PEG-PLGA NP proved 
to be an effective nanoparticulate delivery system and it may represent a novel anti-metastatic 
drug candidate for therapeutic benefit in invasive breast cancers.
