IMPORTANCE Wide heterogeneity exists in acute myocardial infarction treatment and
outcomes in India.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of a locally adapted quality improvement tool kit on clinical
outcomes and process measures in Kerala, a southern Indian state.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cluster randomized, stepped-wedge clinical trial
conducted between November 10, 2014, and November 9, 2016, in 63 hospitals in Kerala,
India, with a last date of follow-up of December 31, 2016. During 5 predefined steps over the
study period, hospitals were randomly selected to move in a 1-way crossover from the control
group to the intervention group. Consecutively presenting patients with acute myocardial
infarction were offered participation.
INTERVENTIONS Hospitals provided either usual care (control group; n = 10 066 participants
[step 0: n = 2915; step 1: n = 2649; step 2: n = 2251; step 3: n = 1422; step 4; n = 829; step 5:
n = 0]) or care using a quality improvement tool kit (intervention group; n = 11 308 participants
[step 0: n = 0; step 1: n = 662; step 2: n = 1265; step 3: n = 2432; step 4: n = 3214; step 5:
n = 3735]) that consisted of audit and feedback, checklists, patient education materials, and
linkage to emergency cardiovascular care and quality improvement training.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the composite of all-cause death,
reinfarction, stroke, or major bleeding using standardized definitions at 30 days. Secondary
outcomes included the primary outcome’
s individual components, 30-day cardiovascular
death, medication use, and tobacco cessation counseling. Mixed-effects logistic regression
models were used to account for clustering and temporal trends.
RESULTS Among 21 374 eligible randomized participants (mean age, 60.6 [SD, 12.0] years;
n = 16 183 men [76%] ; n = 13 689 [64%] with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction),
21 079 (99%) completed the trial. The primary composite outcome was observed in 5.3% of
the intervention participants and 6.4% of the control participants. The observed difference in
30-day major adverse cardiovascular event rates between the groups was not statistically
significant after adjustment (adjusted risk difference, −0.09% [95% CI, −1.32% to 1.14%];
adjusted odds ratio, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.80-1.21]). The intervention group had a higher rate of
medication use including reperfusion but no effect on tobacco cessation counseling. There
were no unexpected adverse events reported.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with acute myocardial infarction in Kerala,
India, use of a quality improvement intervention compared with usual care did not decrease a
composite of 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events. Further research is needed to
understand the lack of efficacy.

 I
n 2015, there were an estimated 7.3 million (95% uncer-
tainty interval, 6.8 million–7.8 million) fatal myocardial in-
farctions globally, and South Asia was estimated to have
the world’
s highest age-standardized incident rate of myocar-
dial infarction.1 High-income countries have developed pro-
grams for improving process and outcomes measures for acute
myocardial infarction that have been associated with improve-
ments in care and outcomes with concomitant reductions in
racial/ethnic disparities in care.2 Because ischemic heart dis-
ease represents the leading cause of global deaths,1 improv-
ing the quality of care and outcomes for patients with acute
myocardial infarction, particularly in low- and middle-
income countries, is a global health priority.3
Previous publications on the presentation, manage-
ment, and outcomes of 25 748 acute coronary syndrome
patients from 125 hospitals in Kerala, India,4 have demon-
strated wide heterogeneity in process and outcome measures
across hospitals5 and identified targets for intervention,
including increasing speed and use of guideline-directed
medical therapy. Previous acute myocardial infarction qual-
ity improvement randomized trials that include physician
education, audit and feedback mechanisms,6 clinical
pathways,7 and checklists8 have shown favorable effects
on process measures in low- and middle-income countries
such as Brazil9 and China.10 However, these trials were not
designed or powered to evaluate the effects of these inter-
ventions on clinical outcomes, nor were they designed to
account for temporal trends. A 2017 pre/post–intervention
study in Tamil Nadu, India, also demonstrated favorable
trends with implementation of a hub-and-spoke health sys-
tem intervention but used a nonrandomized study design.11
To determine whether process and outcome measures
could be improved for patients with acute myocardial infarc-
tion with a locally adapted quality improvement tool kit using
a robust study design for better causal inference, we per-
formed a large, pragmatic, cluster randomized, stepped-
wedge trial among 63 hospitals in Kerala.
Methods
Study Design
The Acute Coronary Syndrome Quality Improvement in
Kerala (ACS QUIK) trial was a pragmatic, cluster randomized,
stepped-wedge clinical trial in which hospitals were random-
ized to receive the quality improvement tool kit intervention
at 1 of 5 predefined, 4-month steps over a 24-month period
between November 10, 2014, and November 9, 2016, after
a period of usual care. The last date of follow-up was Decem-
ber 31, 2016. The methods have been previously published.12
A stepped-wedge design is useful when evaluating an inter-
vention when clusters have ethical concerns about being ran-
domized to the control group only for the duration of the trial
and when it is infeasible to disseminate the intervention
simultaneously across a large number of clusters. The study
received ethics board approval from local, national, and
international bodies and was approved by the Indian Health
Ministry Screening Committee. All participants or their prox-
ies provided written informed consent to participate. The
study was conducted according to the study protocol
(Supplement 1) and analyzed according to the statistical
analysis plan (Supplement 2).
Hospitals and Study Participants
We recruited 63 hospitals in Kerala from a sample (n = 125)
that had previously participated in the Kerala Acute
Coronary Syndrome (ACS) Registry.4 We also sought govern-
ment hospitals that had not participated in this registry to
include a range of hospital types (ie, government, private,
nonprofit/charity). To be eligible, hospitals had to identify
2 individuals who would be willing to serve on a quality
improvement team. Patients were eligible to participate if
they presented or were transferred for evaluation and man-
agement of either non–ST-segment elevation myocardial
infarction (NSTEMI) or ST-segment elevation myocardial
infarction (STEMI) based on the Third Universal Definition
of Myocardial Infarction.13
Randomization and Treatment Assignments
The study biostatisticians (D.K. and L.Z.) performed central
computer-based randomization of hospitals. The other mem-
bers of the study team and the selected sites were informed
of the 12 or 13 sites that would cross over to the intervention
period 2 weeks before each of the predefined steps to main-
tain allocation concealment while aiding in training logistics.
We stratified randomization into 4 groups by projected re-
cruitment (≤200, 201-500, 501-1000, and >1000 partici-
pants) based on the Kerala ACS Registry4 to minimize poten-
tial imbalance between the intervention and control periods.
By nature of the trial design, neither personnel nor partici-
pants were blinded to the intervention.
Interventions
We used formative mixed-methods research and evidence
synthesis to adapt previously reported strategies with the
goal of improving process of care and outcome measures.
We created an audit and feedback reporting mechanism
based on key data elements used by the American College of
Cardiology and American Heart Association.14 These reports,
Key Points
Question What is the effect of a locally adapted quality
improvement tool kit for acute coronary syndrome on major
adverse cardiovascular events in Kerala, India?
Findings In this cluster randomized, stepped-wedge clinical trial
that included 63 hospitals and 21 374 participants with acute
myocardial infarction, the 30-day composite event rates were
6.4% in the control phase and 5.3% in the intervention phase,
a difference that did not reach not statistical significance after
adjustment for cluster and temporal trends.
Meaning Among patients with acute myocardial infarction in
Kerala, India, a locally adapted quality improvement tool kit did not
reduce the rate of 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events
compared with usual care.

 which included site-specific measures on performance and
which were sent monthly via email to site investigators,
compared hospital-level performance with other hospitals in
each cohort and with all hospitals in the trial (see eAppendix
in Supplement 3 for sample report). We trained sites on the
interpretation of these reports and on the use of these
reports for informing quality improvement team meetings,
for which we provided meeting templates based on the
Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle of change. The tool kit also in-
cluded standardized admission and discharge order sets;
translated and culturally adapted patient education materi-
als related to tobacco cessation, dietary advice, and physical
activity; and linkage to emergency cardiovascular care train-
ing based on the low prevalence of code teams among the
participating hospitals (see eAppendix in Supplement 3
for sample checklists and patient education materials).
We sought and received feedback from the participating
investigators in the development of this tool kit and pro-
vided free online health care quality and patient safety train-
ing to sites and their teams through the Institute for Health-
care Improvement. The control condition was usual care
according to local hospital practice. We performed a concur-
rent mixed-methods process evaluation for assessing
context, implementation fidelity, and mechanisms of impact
based on the Medical Research Council’
s recommendations15;
these results will be reported separately.
The study team performed central and on-site training for
90 to 120 minutes at each site including with the site investi-
gatorandothermembersofthequalityimprovementteamand
medical staff. We did not include a transition period. Date of
admission was used to define allocation of participants to in-
tervention or control.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the composite end point of 30-day
major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as death,
reinfarction (defined by the Third Universal Definition
of Myocardial Infarction13), stroke, and major bleeding
(defined by the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue
Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries
[GUSTO] criteria,16 which is defined by intracerebral hemor-
rhage or bleeding resulting in substantial hemodynamic com-
promise requiring treatment). Outcome data were collected
at each site either through in-person visits or by telephone
and were reported centrally. If a site was unable to reach a
participant after 3 attempts, then that participant was consid-
ered lost to follow-up. Although the outcome assessors were
not blinded, there did not appear to be a high risk of ascer-
tainment bias to influence the treatment effect for objective
outcomes such as these.17
Secondary outcomes included 30-day all-cause mortal-
ity, 30-day cardiovascular mortality, in-hospital mortality,
30-day myocardial reinfarction, 30-day stroke, 30-day
major GUSTO bleeding, optimal in-hospital medication use
(composed of aspirin, adenosine diphosphate receptor
antagonist [clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor], anticoagu-
lant, and β-blocker; in-hospital statin use was additionally
predefined but data were not collected), optimal discharge
medication use (composed of aspirin, adenosine diphos-
phate receptor antagonist [clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagre-
lor], statin, and β-blocker), and tobacco cessation advice.
We performed post hoc analyses evaluating the effect of the
intervention on major adverse cardiovascular events plus
in-hospital incident heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and
cardiac arrest.
Statistical Analysis
We initiated the trial with a target sample size of 15 750 par-
ticipants from 63 hospitals with 5 steps to have 80% power to
achieve a 2.4% absolute reduction in major adverse cardio-
vascular events with a 2-sided α = .05.18 We assumed a rate of
loss to follow-up of 5% and an intraclass correlation coeffi-
cient of 0.05 based on data from the Kerala ACS Registry
(unpublished data) and a previous quality improvement trial
in Brazil.19 This intervention effect estimate was based on the
difference between leading and lagging hospitals’perfor-
mance and outcomes from previous observational research.20
Prespecified participant-level results are reported.
Baseline characteristics (unadjusted and adjusted for
within-hospital clustering and temporal trends) were sum-
marized for intervention and control groups. For the primary
outcome, the overall difference in 30-day major adverse car-
diovascular event rates between control and intervention
periods was reported. In the primary analysis, 30-day major
adverse cardiovascular events were modeled using mixed-
effects logistic regression with a random cluster (hospital)
effect and a fixed time effect for every 4-month step. As a
secondary analysis, the model was also adjusted for age, sex,
type of myocardial infarction, systolic blood pressure, heart
rate, serum creatinine level, acute heart failure, cardiogenic
shock, and resuscitated cardiac arrest, which are covariates
included in the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events
(GRACE) risk score.21 We performed post hoc analyses to
evaluate the potential effect of the intervention on an
expanded definition of major adverse cardiovascular events
to include cardiogenic shock, incident heart failure, and car-
diac arrest and the interaction between time spent in the
intervention period and the adjusted 30-day major adverse
cardiovascular event rate. Results are also reported by
prespecified subgroups of participant age, sex, STEMI
vs NSTEMI, hospital size, and hospital type, for which we
also tested interaction effects.
All results are reported using an intention-to-treat analy-
sis. The interim analysis was performed at 12 months for
reporting to the data and safety monitoring board, but only
the study biostatisticians (D.K. and L.Z.) were unblinded
to the results. To adjust for the interim analysis, the O’
Brien-
Fleming stopping boundary was set at z>2.797 with a 2-sided
significance level of .005 for the interim analysis and
z>1.977 with a 2-sided significance level of .048 for the final
analysis. We did not make additional a priori adjustments to
the significance threshold for secondary outcomes based on
multiple testing; therefore, these analyses should be consid-
ered exploratory.
Biweekly central statistical monitoring was done
using previously published algorithms22 for risk-based site

All hospitals approached agreed to participate and were included. Randomization occurred at a single time point
prior to patient enrollment. Hospitals were blinded to their assigned cohort until 2 weeks prior to the time point at
which their cohort moved from the control stage to intervention stage. Participants lost to follow-up include
those who could not be reached after 3 contact attempts and those for whom the site did not perform the
follow-up procedure. Patients lost to follow-up were included in the analysis.

 monitoring. After study completion, 1 site was identified with
an improbably high rate of reinfarction, which prompted
quality assurance sampling of 10% of cases with correspond-
ing controls among the study sites through blinded site sur-
veys. Two additional sites with systematic error were identi-
fied in outcome reporting, which resulted in 13 changes to
the primary outcome (1% of overall events).

Results
Figure 1 shows the flow of hospitals and participants.
We recruited 22 557 participants from 63 hospitals, includ-

colleges, and 19% nonprofit/charity. Participants were ineli-
gible and excluded if they had cardiac biomarker measure-
ments that were missing or not elevated (for NSTEMI only
because some patients with ST elevations and chest pain did
not undergo biomarker testing [n = 954]), were transferred
after thrombolytic therapy for STEMI without any further
therapy (n = 132), were admitted outside the study period
(n = 91), or had implausible time discrepancies (n = 6).
Follow-up through 30 days was 99%. Among 21 374 eligible

 participants,295 (1%) had incomplete outcome data (215
patients were not followed up by the enrolling site and
80 patients could not be reached after 3 contact attempts).
Unadjusted baseline characteristics between included
participants and participants missing follow-up data were gen-
erally similar except for a lower initial troponin level in the for-
mer group (1.3 ng/mL vs 4.6 ng/mL; P < .001) (eTable 1 in
Supplement 3). The intervention and control groups included
11 308 (53%) and 10 066 (47%) participants, respectively.
Participants
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics for the interven-
tion and control groups. The mean age of the participants was
60.6 years, 76% were men, 31% had a history of tobacco use,
and 44% had a history of diabetes mellitus. Sixty-four per-
cent of participants presented with STEMI, with a median
(symptom-to-door time of 240 (interquartile range, 120-840)
minutes in the control group compared with 255 (interquar-
tile range, 111-825) minutes in the intervention group.
Table 2 shows the association of process of care and
time-based characteristics with the intervention, both unad-
justed and adjusted for within-hospital clustering and tem-
poral trends. Compared with the control group, the interven-
tion group had a higher rate of prehospital aspirin use
(18.6% vs 16.9%; adjusted risk difference, 3.80% [95% CI,
2.08%-5.52%]; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.40 [95% CI, 1.21-
1.62]) but similarly low rates of prehospital thrombolysis
(<1%). Among eligible individuals without contraindications,
rates of in-hospital aspirin use and a second antiplatelet
medication (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) were high
(>95%) and similar in both groups. Compared with the con-
trol group, the intervention group had a higher rate of
in-hospital β-blocker use (43% vs 37%; adjusted risk differ-
ence, 6.25% [95% CI, 4.10%-8.10%]; adjusted OR, 1.46 [95%

Primary Analysis
Table 3 shows the cluster-adjusted and cluster- and temporal-
adjusted primary and secondary trial outcome event rates
using mixed-effects logistic regression models that account
for within-hospital clustering and temporal trends. The
unadjusted rate of 30-day major adverse cardiovascular
events was 5.3% in the intervention group compared with
6.4%inthecontrolgroup.Figure2Ashowsthetemporaltrends
for 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events by group
and step. The cluster-adjusted OR for 30-day major adverse
cardiovascular events was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.81-1.04), which
was not statistically significant after further adjustment for
temporal trends (adjusted risk difference, −0.09% [95% CI,
−1.32% to 1.14%]; adjusted OR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.80-1.21]).
Results were similar after multiple imputation of data from in-
dividualswhohadmissingfollow-updataorwerelosttofollow-
up. After sensitivity analyses of hypothetical scenarios to ac-
count for the potential effects of missing follow-up events and
using multiple imputation, the range of results varied more
broadly, but overall plausible results were consistent with the
reported primary analysis.

 Secondary and Post Hoc Analyses
The rate of 30-day death was 3.9% in the intervention group
compared with 5.1% in the control group. Figure 2B shows the
temporal trends for 30-day death by group and step. The clus-
ter-adjusted OR for 30-day death was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.75-
1.00), an effect that was not statistically significant after ad-
justing for temporal trends (adjusted risk difference, −0.28%
[95% CI, −1.35% to 0.80%]; adjusted OR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.74-
1.19]). These results did not materially change after adjust-
ment for GRACE score covariates (eTable 5 in Supplement 3).
In-hospital outcomes demonstrated a similar pattern overall.
We also tested post hoc for a potential interaction for length
of time exposed to the intervention to evaluate whether the
interventionmighthavebeenmoreeffectiveifgivenoveralon-
ger period, and the overall effects were similar (eTable 6 in
Supplement 3).
In a post hoc analysis, we evaluated the effect of the
intervention on the expanded outcome of 30-day major
adverse cardiovascular event plus incident in-hospital heart
failure, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest (eTable 7 in
Supplement 3). The unadjusted rate was 7.0% in the inter-
vention group and 9.1% in the control group. The cluster-
adjusted OR for this outcome was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.80-1.00),
which was similar after temporal adjustment (adjusted risk

Figure 3 shows the effect of the intervention on the rate
of 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events by prespeci-
fied subgroups, including age, sex, STEMI vs NSTEMI, hospi-
tal size, and hospital type. We found a similar pattern of ef-
fect across subgroups. eFigure 1A in Supplement 3 shows the
heterogeneity of the primary outcome by hospital through
a residual plot, which evaluates the event rate by site com-
pared with the mean event rate throughout the entire trial.
eFigure 1B in Supplement 3 shows the unadjusted within-
hospital difference in the rate of 30-day composite major
adverse cardiovascular events between the intervention and
control groups. eFigures 2A and 2B in Supplement 3 show tem-

rates within and among hospitals.
Discussion
The use of a locally adapted quality improvement tool kit did
not reduce the primary outcome of death, reinfarction,
stroke, or major bleeding at 30 days among patients present-
ing with acute myocardial infarction to Kerala hospitals.
Major adverse cardiovascular event rates were lower than
previously estimated from Kerala, and in-hospital and dis-
charge treatment rates were higher, which may have influ-
enced the results.4 Symptom-to-door times were also shorter
than in previous reports from India.4,24 Hospitals’previous
participation in the Kerala ACS Registry4 or contamination
between intervention and control groups may have also
influenced these results through improved care throughout
the state over the study period. However, the intervention
may not have been effective because of insufficient training,
implementation or adoption of the intervention, or period of
exposure to sufficiently change hospital practice, including
among process measures such as speed of reperfusion
therapy. Although the absolute event rate was lower in the
intervention group, the stepped-wedge trial design demon-
strates the importance of accounting for temporal trends for
this type of intervention.
The intervention led to lower 30-day major adverse car-
diovascular event and mortality rates in the first step com-
pared with other steps. Potential reasons for this observation
include (1) smaller sample size and instability of the estimate;
(2) lack of contamination; (3) baseline participant- or hospital-
level characteristics; or (4) chance. The intervention led to a
higher rate of in-hospital use of reperfusion, thrombolytic
therapy, and anticoagulation and a higher rate of discharge as-
pirin,β-blocker,statin,andangiotensin-convertingenzymein-
hibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker prescriptions. A post
hoc analysis demonstrated that the intervention led to a lower
rate of expanded major adverse cardiovascular events, which
also included in-hospital heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and
cardiac arrest, but other secondary clinical outcomes were not
different between groups. It is possible that these post hoc out-
come findings were driven by the improvements in medica-

 The primary outcome results were consistent across pre-
specified individual- and hospital-level subgroups despite
heterogeneity of effect among hospitals. This heterogeneity
may have been driven by site-level personnel, intervention fi-
delity, recruitment or detection bias, or chance but requires
future research.
Previous cluster randomized trials of acute coronary
syndrome quality improvement in low- and middle-income
countries, including the Brazilian Intervention to In-
crease Evidence Usage in Acute Coronary Syndromes
(BRIDGE-ACS),9 and Clinical Pathways for Acute Coronary
Syndrome-Phase 2 (CPACS-2),25 demonstrated improve-
ments in composite medication use and reperfusion among
patients with STEMI. These smaller trials did not demon-
strate statistically significant improvements in clinical out-
comes but were also not powered to detect such differences.
However, these trials also demonstrated lower intraclass cor-
relation coefficients than in the present study and did not
use a stepped-wedge design to account for temporal trends.
The recently completed Clinical Pathways for Acute Coro-
nary Syndrome–Phase 3 (CPACS-3) trial enrolled more than
29 000 Chinese participants using a cluster randomized,
stepped-wedge design may be helpful for understanding the
effects of quality improvement interventions in low- and
middle-income country settings.25 Results from the present
trial contrast with the favorable temporal trends in clinical
outcomes that have been demonstrated in nonrandomized
quality improvement and health system intervention stud-
ies, including a 2017 nonrandomized trial11 designed to
increase primary percutaneous coronary intervention use in
Tamil Nadu. These differences may be related to study
design, intervention targets, components, training and
implementation, comparator group outcomes, or a combina-
tion thereof. Event rates in this trial were similar to out-
comes reported from the American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association Acute Coronary Treatment and
Intervention Outcomes Network–Get With the Guidelines
(ACTION-GWTG) program in 2014 (in-hospital mortality,
6.4% for STEMI and 3.4% for NSTEMI).26 However, there are
important gaps in guideline-directed care that remain in
acute myocardial infarction care in Kerala, including rate
and speed of reperfusion, and likely gaps in other acute car-
diovascular conditions (eg, stroke, heart failure), other states
in India, and other low- and middle-income countries that
warrant further study.
This study has several strengths. First, this trial built on
previous observational data from the Kerala Acute Coronary
Syndrome Registry and collaborated with the Cardiological So-
ciety of India–Kerala Chapter to execute the largest random-
ized cardiovascular intervention trial in India to date. Sec-
ond, this study used a trial design with appropriate statistical
methods to improve internal validity of the results. Third, this
trial used advanced yet low-cost trial monitoring procedures,
including central statistical, risk-based monitoring, to cap-
ture high-quality data from many sites that had not previ-
ously participated in clinical trials.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the complex inter-
vention included several evidence-based components (eg, au-
dit and feedback to improve process measures,6 checklists to
reduce errors8) that may not have been fully implemented at
all sites or for a sufficient duration to improve clinical out-
comes.Understandingtheexternalandinternalconditionsthat
were associated with improved intervention implementation
and outcomes requires further research. Second, the trial was
susceptible to recruitment bias because, while randomiza-
tion occurred at the cluster level, informed consent was re-
quiredfromindividualparticipantsfor30-dayfollow-up.How-
ever, baseline differences in key covariates associated with the
primary outcome were limited. Third, these results demon-
strated higher-than-anticipated intraclass correlation coeffi-
cients than previous trials and pretrial estimates, which re-
duced statistical power. However, it seems unlikely that this
would have materially changed the primary outcome esti-
mate.Fourth,qualityofclinicalcarewashigherandeventrates
were lower than anticipated in the trial. It is uncertain whether
such an intervention would be effective in an environment
where the quality of care is lower or the event rates are higher.
Fifth, secondary analyses were not adjusted for multiple com-
parisons, which increases the possibility of type I error.
Conclusions
Among patients with acute myocardial infarction in Kerala, In-
dia, use of a quality improvement intervention compared with
usual care did not decrease a composite of 30-day major ad-
verse cardiovascular events. Further research is needed to un-
derstand the lack of efficacy.
