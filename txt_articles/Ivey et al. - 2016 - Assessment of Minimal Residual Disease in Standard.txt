BACKGROUND
Despite the molecular heterogeneity of standard-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 
treatment decisions are based on a limited number of molecular genetic markers and 
morphology-based assessment of remission. Sensitive detection of a leukemia-specific 
marker (e.g., a mutation in the gene encoding nucleophosmin [NPM1]) could improve 
prognostication by identifying submicroscopic disease during remission.
METHODS
We used a reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay to detect 
minimal residual disease in 2569 samples obtained from 346 patients with NPM1-
mutated AML who had undergone intensive treatment in the National Cancer Research 
Institute AML17 trial. We used a custom 51-gene panel to perform targeted sequencing 
of 223 samples obtained at the time of diagnosis and 49 samples obtained at the time 
of relapse. Mutations associated with preleukemic clones were tracked by means of 
digital polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS
Molecular profiling highlighted the complexity of NPM1-mutated AML, with segrega-
tion of patients into more than 150 subgroups, thus precluding reliable outcome pre-
diction. The determination of minimal-residual-disease status was more informative. 
Persistence of NPM1-mutated transcripts in blood was present in 15% of the patients 
after the second chemotherapy cycle and was associated with a greater risk of relapse 
after 3 years of follow-up than was an absence of such transcripts (82% vs. 30%; haz-
ard ratio, 4.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.95 to 7.80; P<0.001) and a lower rate of 
survival (24% vs. 75%; hazard ratio for death, 4.38; 95% CI, 2.57 to 7.47; P<0.001). The 
presence of minimal residual disease was the only independent prognostic factor for 
death in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 4.84; 95% CI, 2.57 to 9.15; P<0.001). These 
results were validated in an independent cohort. On sequential monitoring of minimal 
residual disease, relapse was reliably predicted by a rising level of NPM1-mutated tran-
scripts. Although mutations associated with preleukemic clones remained detectable 
during ongoing remission after chemotherapy, NPM1 mutations were detected in 69 of 
70 patients at the time of relapse and provided a better marker of disease status.
CONCLUSIONS
The presence of minimal residual disease, as determined by quantitation of NPM1-
mutated transcripts, provided powerful prognostic information independent of other 
risk factors. (Funded by Bloodwise and the National Institute for Health Research;

Minimal Residual Disease in Standard-Risk AML
A 
lthough acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) is genetically less complex than 
many other tumors, the condition is 
molecularly heterogeneous.1-3 Despite improved 
understanding of the mutational landscape, treat-
ment decisions, particularly regarding allogeneic 
stem-cell transplantation, remain guided by cyto-
genetic analysis, a limited panel of molecular 
genetic markers, and morphology-based assess-
ment of remission.4-6
Currently, a predicted risk of relapse of more 
than 35% is widely considered to warrant stem-
cell transplantation during the first remission.5 
Patients with high-risk disease undergo stem-
cell transplantation if feasible, whereas those 
with low-risk disease usually do not. However, 
there is uncertainty about the role of transplan-
tation in patients with cytogenetically standard-
risk AML (most of whom have cytogenetically 
normal AML), which affects approximately 50% 
of younger adult patients. The most common 
molecular lesion in this group (which is present 
in approximately a third of patients with AML 
and more than half of those with cytogenetically 
normal AML) is a mutation in the gene encoding 
nucleophosmin (NPM1).7 The outcome of disease 
treatment is influenced by the presence or ab-
sence of cooperating internal tandem duplica-
tions in the gene encoding Fms-like tyrosine 
kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD) and of mutations in the gene 
encoding DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A).8-12 
Patients who have mutated NPM1 without the 
FLT3-ITD genotype have a comparatively better 
outcome than do those with coexisting FLT3-ITD 
mutations and hence are no longer recommend-
ed for transplantation during the first remis-
sion.4-6,8 In contrast, patients with mutated NPM1 
and coexisting FLT3-ITD or DNMT3A mutations 
(who account for approximately 66% of patients 
with NPM1-mutated AML) have a poorer progno-
sis and may be considered as candidates for 
transplantation.
There is growing interest in whether prognos-
tication can be improved through more extensive 
molecular profiling that capitalizes on advances 
in sequencing technology.3,13,14 In addition, the 
risk of relapse may be better defined with the 
use of leukemia-specific molecular markers (e.g., 
mutated NPM1) as targets for detection of sub-
microscopic levels of leukemia, so-called mini-
mal residual disease, after therapy.15 Although 
the presence of minimal residual disease can 
provide prognostic information,16-22 it is unclear 
whether such identification is useful in the con-
text of systematic molecular profiling. Moreover, 
questions have been raised about the assessment 
of minimal residual disease in routine practice, 
given the clonal complexity of AML. Recent 
studies have indicated that markers such as mu-
tated NPM1 may not always be stable over the 
course of disease and that relapse potentially 
emanates from preleukemic clones.23,24 To ad-
dress these issues, we undertook molecular 
profiling and sequential monitoring of minimal 
residual disease in a large series of patients with 
NPM1-mutated AML who had undergone inten-
sive treatment in the National Cancer Research 
Institute (NCRI) AML17 trial.
Methods
Patients
Patients were enrolled in the NCRI AML17 trial 
from April 6, 2009, to December 31, 2014. (A list 
of treatments is provided in Fig. S1 in Supple-
mentary Appendix 1, available with the full text 
of this article at NEJM.org.)25 Post-remission treat-
ment (consolidation therapy) was determined ac-
cording to the Medical Research Council (MRC) 
risk score,26,27 with poor-risk patients recom-
mended for stem-cell transplantation during the 
first remission. (The MRC risk score can range 
from 1.28 to 4.76 or more, with higher values 
indicating greater risk.) Centralized molecular 
screening identified patients with NPM1 muta-
tions.11,28 Follow-up samples were scheduled to 
be obtained at the time of blood-count regenera-
tion after each cycle of treatment and then quar-
terly until 24 months after consolidation therapy. 
Samples that were obtained at early time points 
(i.e., on regeneration after induction and con-
solidation cycles) were mostly samples of periph-
eral blood, since the evaluation of bone marrow 
was prioritized for flow cytometry.
In the development phase of this study 
(from April 2009 through May 2012), clinicians 
were not informed about the status of minimal 
residual disease so that its prognostic value 
could be reliably assessed. In June 2012, we 
observed that molecular relapse was associated 
with disease progression. From that time on, 
we prospectively analyzed follow-up samples and 
immediately informed clinicians of the results. 
Patients who were recruited between June 2012 
and December 2014 made up a validation 
 
cohort.

Amplification of NPM1-Mutated Transcripts
To amplify NPM1-mutated transcripts, we pre-
pared complementary DNA from total RNA, as 
described previously.29 We detected minimal re-
sidual disease on reverse-transcriptase quantita-
tive polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)16 using 
a mutation-specific primer with a common primer 
and probe (Fig. 1, and Table S1 in Supplemen-
tary Appendix 1). To detect rare mutations, we 
designed patient-specific primers (Primer Express, 
Applied Biosystems). Assays were run in tripli-
cate on the ABI 7900 platform (Applied Biosys-
tems), and mutated transcript levels were com-
pared to expression of the ABL1 reference gene 
with the use of plasmid standards (Qiagen), with 
the difference-in-cycle-thresholds method used for 
rare mutations.29 Assays were performed under 
PCR conditions proposed by the Europe Against 
Cancer (EAC) program30 except for the annealing 
temperature, which was adjusted to eliminate 
background amplification (Table S1 in Supple-
mentary Appendix 1). Follow-up samples with 
Figure 1. Detection of Minimal Residual Disease by Analysis of NPM1-Mutated Transcripts.
NPM1 mutations that were identified in 346 patients in the AML17 trial served as targets to track minimal residual 
disease by means of reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-qPCR) assays with primers 
designed to amplify different mutant NPM1 transcripts. Mutations that were identified on central molecular screen-
ing11,28 were confirmed on PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. All NPM1 mutations (red) occurred in exon 12 
and resulted in a net insertion of four base pairs. The three most common mutations (types A, B, and D) accounted 
for 90% of cases. Rare or unique mutations were found in the remaining 10%. On the basis of the assay described 
by Gorello and colleagues,16 a common forward primer and probe (purple) were combined with a mutant-specific 
reverse primer to detect minimal residual disease. Additional details are provided in Table S1 in Supplementary 
 
Appendix 1.

Minimal Residual Disease in Standard-Risk AML
ABL1 cycle-threshold values of 30 or more were 
excluded from the analysis. RT-qPCR positivity 
for mutated NPM1 was defined according to am-
plification in at least two of three replicates with 
cycle-threshold values of 40 or less (using a thresh-
old setting of 0.1), according to EAC criteria.30
Whole-Exome Sequencing, Molecular 
Profiling, and Digital PCR
Genomic DNA libraries that had been prepared 
with the use of the SureSelectXT Human All Exon 
V4 target-enrichment system (Agilent Technolo-
gies) were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 
2000 platform with 100-bp paired-end reads. 
(Details regarding read alignment and variant 
calling are provided in the Methods section in 
Supplementary Appendix 1.)
We developed a custom-targeted sequencing 
panel of 51 genes31 that was based on published 
data for NPM1-mutated AML2 and on exome se-
quencing of samples obtained from 22 patients 
in the study cohort (Table S2 in Supplementary 
Appendix 1 and Table S3 in Supplementary Ap-
pendix 2). High-throughput sequencing with the 
use of HaloPlex Target Enrichment (Agilent Tech-
nologies) was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 
2000.31 Diagnostic DNA from 223 samples ob-
tained from patients with NPM1-mutated AML 
was sequenced, and additional mutations (median 
number, 3; range, 1 to 8) were identified in 222 
samples (99.6%), with a median read depth of 
1280× (range, 51 to 6700). We determined the 
frequencies of mutated NPM1 and FLT3-ITD 
 
alleles in parallel using GeneScan analysis.32 
(Details regarding digital PCR assays are pro-
vided in the Methods section in Supplementary 
Appendix 1.)
Study End Points
All end points were based on the revised criteria 
of the International Working Group for Diagno-
sis, Standardization of Response Criteria, Treat-
ment Outcomes, and Reporting Standards for 
Therapeutic Trials in Acute Myeloid Leukemia, 
except that the recovery of cell counts in periph-
eral blood was not required for a determination 
of complete remission.33 The definition of mo-
lecular remission was an absence of detectable 
NPM1-mutated transcripts on RT-qPCR in a bone 
marrow sample affording a sensitivity of at least 
1 in 10,000. Among patients who had a molecular 
remission, a molecular relapse was defined as 
the detection of increasing levels of NPM1-mutated 
transcripts in two successive samples in the ab-
sence of hematologic relapse. Median follow-up 
for survival was 40.5 months in the development 
cohort and 13.6 months in the validation cohort.
Statistical Analysis
We used Kaplan–Meier estimates or the com-
peting-risks method to calculate survival percent-
ages. Time-to-event analyses were performed with 
either the log-rank test or Cox regression, with 
the effect of transplantation analyzed by means 
of the Mantel–Byar method. We used Cox regres-
sion with forward selection to identify indepen-
dent prognostic factors. All reported P values are 
two-sided, and P values of less than 0.05 were 
considered to indicate statistical significance.
Results
Detection of Minimal Residual Disease  
in Patients with NPM1 Mutations
The preliminary development phase involved 
346 patients with NPM1 mutations (median age, 
50 years; range, 6 to 68) who had available follow-
up samples. We used mutation-specific reverse 
primers on RT-qPCR to detect the presence of 
minimal residual disease in patients who carried 
a total of 27 different mutations (Fig. 1, and 
Table S1 in Supplementary Appendix 1). The 
median sensitivity, as determined with the use 
of diagnostic samples, was 1.0×10−5 (range, 
1.0×10−3.7 to 1.0×10−7.1).
Early Assessment of Minimal Residual Disease 
and Relapse Risk
In the development phase, we analyzed 2569 
follow-up samples that could be evaluated (902 
bone marrow samples and 1667 peripheral-blood 
samples), for a median of 6 samples per patient. 
During therapy, we observed higher rates of de-
tection of minimal residual disease in bone mar-
row than in peripheral blood. Nevertheless, the 
presence of minimal residual disease in periph-
eral blood was highly informative among patients 
in complete remission on morphologic analysis. 
The persistence of NPM1-mutated transcripts in 
peripheral blood after regeneration following the 
second chemotherapy cycle was associated with 
a significantly higher risk of relapse at 3 years 
than was the absence of such transcripts (82% 
vs. 30%; univariate hazard ratio, 4.80; 95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 2.95 to 7.80; P<0.001) and 
a lower rate of survival (24% vs. 75%; univariate

P<0.001) (Table 1 and Fig. 2). The presence of 
minimal residual disease in peripheral blood 
among patients in complete remission on mor-
phologic analysis after the second chemotherapy 
cycle was more discriminatory than RT-qPCR 
positivity in peripheral blood at any other time 
point or in bone marrow at any time point dur-
ing therapy (Table S4 in Supplementary Appen-
dix 1). After adjustment for minimal-residual-
disease status in peripheral blood following the 
second chemotherapy cycle, no other measure-
ment of minimal residual disease provided addi-
tional prognostic value.
Minimal-Residual-Disease Status  
and Mutation Profile
To assess whether the status of minimal residual 
disease in peripheral blood after the second che-
motherapy cycle was an independent prognostic 
factor, we performed univariate and multivariate 
analyses (Table 1) and included the results of 
sequencing analyses (which identified 161 unique 
genetic subgroups or 76 subgroups if only the 10 
most common genetic targets were considered) 
(Fig. 3). On univariate analysis, the risk of re-
lapse was significantly higher among patients 
with an increased white-cell count, the presence

Figure 3. Mutation Status of Genes in 223 Samples of NPM1-Mutated AML.
Targeted gene sequencing was performed with a custom 51-gene panel.31 The genes represented on this panel were selected on the basis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data2 
and on data obtained by exome-sequencing analysis of 19 diagnostic samples and 11 relapse samples obtained from 22 study cohort patients; of these patients, 5 were in ongoing 
complete remission and 17 were subject to relapse. On the basis of the exome-sequencing data, included in the panel were CCND3, CTCF, KDM3B, KDM6A, KMT2D, LZTR1, MYC, 
NIPBL, POT1, SS18, and ZBTB7A. (Additional details are provided in Table S3 in Supplementary Appendix 2.) Each column represents an individual patient, with mutations grouped 
into functional categories. Mutated status is indicated in black, and wild-type status in white. Shown at the bottom of the graph are data for patients who were separated into sub-
groups on the basis of sharing the same combination of mutations among the top 10 mutational targets — NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, TET2, WT1, FLT3-ITD, FLT3 point muta-
tion (FLT3-PM), NRAS, and PTPN11 — and among mutations in the full panel of genes. Also shown is the status of patients with respect to minimal residual disease (MRD) in pe-
ripheral blood after two cycles of chemotherapy on RT-qPCR assay; black indicates MRD-positive, white indicates MRD-negative, and gray indicates that no sample was available.

Minimal Residual Disease in Standard-Risk AML
of DNMT3A and FLT3-ITD mutations, and the 
presence of minimal residual disease in periph-
eral blood after the second chemotherapy cycle. 
Only an increased white-cell count and the pres-
ence of minimal residual disease were significant-
ly associated with the rate of survival. We could 
find no specific molecular subgroup consisting 
of 10 patients or more that had a rate of sur-
vival of less than 52%; in contrast, the rate in 
the group with the presence of minimal residual 
disease was 24%. Patients with minimal residual 
disease in peripheral blood after the second chemo-
therapy cycle were more likely to have a high MRC 
risk score (i.e., >2.6667) than were those without 
minimal residual disease (50% vs. 16%, P<0.001) 
and to carry the FLT3-ITD mutation (62% vs. 
35%, P 
= 
0.006). However, among patients who 
had AML with mutated FLT3-ITD, there was no 
significant difference in the allelic burden be-
tween those with minimal residual disease and 
those without minimal residual disease.
In multivariate modeling with forward selec-
tion, the presence of minimal residual disease 
was the only significant prognostic factor for 
relapse (hazard ratio, 5.09; 95% CI, 2.84 to 9.13; 
P<0.001) or death (hazard ratio, 4.84; 2.57 to 
9.15; P<0.001). Among patients without one of 
the mutations associated with increased risk 
(FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A), those with minimal 
residual disease had a poorer outcome than did 
those without minimal residual disease (Fig. 2). 
Conversely, among patients with a high-risk geno-
type (FLT3-ITD, mutated DNMT3A, or both), nega-
tive results on RT-qPCR assay of peripheral blood 
after the second chemotherapy cycle distinguished 
93 of 117 patients (79%) who had a relatively 
favorable outcome (rate of survival, 76%). After 
adjustment for the status of minimal residual 
disease, additional prognostic information about 
survival was not provided by the presence of 
mutations in FLT3-ITD (P 
= 
0.45) or in DNMT3A 
(P 
= 
0.93) or by the MRC risk group (P 
= 
0.98).
Minimal Residual Disease and Prognosis  
in the Validation Cohort
To ensure that our findings were replicable, we 
investigated the status of minimal residual dis-
ease in a validation cohort of 91 patients with 
NPM1 mutations who were enrolled in the AML17 
study starting in June 2012. The analyses con-
firmed that the presence of minimal residual 
disease in peripheral blood on RT-qPCR assay 
after the second chemotherapy cycle predicted a 
worse outcome at 2 years than did the absence 
of minimal residual disease, with an increased 
cumulative incidence of relapse (70% vs. 31%, 
P 
= 
0.001) and a lower rate of overall survival 
(40% vs. 87%, P 
= 
0.001) (Fig. 4).
In sensitivity analyses of data from the entire 
cohort to identify any effect of additional treat-
ments, there were no significant interactions 
with any randomized therapy. However, there 
was a potential interaction with the use of gem-
tuzumab ozogamicin (P 
= 
0.07 for interaction), 
with less effect of minimal residual disease 
among patients receiving the drug, although the 
numbers were small (5 patients without mini-
mal residual disease vs. 8 patients with minimal 
residual disease); at 5 years, the rates of survival 
among patients who received gemtuzumab ozo-
gamicin were 63% among patients without 
minimal residual disease and 33% among those 
with minimal residual disease.
In the entire cohort, stem-cell transplantation 
was performed in 21 of 46 patients (46%) with 
minimal residual disease and in 61 of 239 pa-
tients (26%) without minimal residual disease 
(P 
= 
0.006). Among patients with FLT3-ITD muta-
tions, stem-cell transplantation was performed 
in 12 of 27 patients (44%) with minimal residual 
disease and in 22 of 81 patients (27%) without 
minimal residual disease; among patients with-
out FLT3-ITD mutations, stem-cell transplantation 
was performed in 9 of 18 patients (50%) with 
minimal residual disease and in 38 of 155 pa-
tients (25%) without minimal residual disease. 
Among patients with DNMT3A mutations, stem-
cell transplantation was performed in 5 of 17 
patients (29%) with minimal residual disease 
and in 20 of 56 patients (36%) without minimal 
residual disease; among patients without DNMT3A 
mutations, stem-cell transplantation was per-
formed in 3 of 6 patients (50%) with minimal 
residual disease and in 15 of 70 patients (21%) 
without minimal residual disease.
In a sensitivity analysis in which survival was 
censored at the time of stem-cell transplanta-
tion, the absence of minimal residual disease 
remained prognostic (hazard ratio, 0.11; 95% CI, 
0.05 to 0.26; P<0.001). On Mantel–Byar analysis, 
there was no significant effect of transplanta-
tion overall or among patients according to sta-
tus with respect to minimal residual disease, 
although the numbers of patients were small.

Sequential RT-qPCR Monitoring in Prediction 
of Relapse among Patients with NPM1 
Mutations
The results of sequential monitoring of samples 
that were obtained after the end of consolidation 
treatment were available for 243 patients with 
NPM1 mutations in the development cohort. 
Among 53 patients in morphologic remission, a 
rising NPM1-mutated transcript level in preced-
ing samples on RT-qPCR reliably predicted the 
occurrence of a hematologic relapse (median 
increment, 0.7 log10 per month; range, 0.3 to 2.0) 
(Fig. S2 in Supplementary Appendix 1). Serial 
monitoring of paired samples of bone marrow 
and peripheral blood showed that the analysis of 
bone marrow increased the rate of detection of 
minimal residual disease, affording a median 
1-log10 increment in sensitivity (Fig. S3 in Supple-
mentary Appendix 1). The analysis of the time 
from the first molecular positivity to relapse 
showed a longer time to relapse if minimal re-
sidual disease was first detected in bone marrow 
than if it was first detected in peripheral blood 
(median, 133 days vs. 87 days; P 
= 
0.65). Molecu-
lar relapse was diagnosed in an additional 11 
patients; of these patients, 10 received preemp-
tive therapy and 1 died from a cardiac event 
while in clinical remission.
Targeted sequencing at the time of molecular 
or hematologic relapse showed that the variant 
allele frequencies in some genes exceeded those 
in NPM1 in 34 of 49 patients (69%) who were 
tested, a finding that was consistent with acqui-
sition of uniparental disomy34 in the case of 
FLT3-ITD and the probable presence of preleuke-
mic clones for DNMT3A, TET2, and IDH1 muta-
tions (Fig. S4 in Supplementary Appendix 1). In 
addition, mutations in DNMT3A, TET2, and IDH2 
were detected at low levels in remission samples 
that were used as controls for exome sequencing 
and that were negative for NPM1 mutations at a 
sensitivity of at least 1.0×10−4 (Table S3 in Sup-
plementary Appendix 2). Regardless of mutations 
associated with preleukemic clones, RT-qPCR 
analysis of available relapse samples showed 
that NPM1 mutations were a stable marker of 
AML disease status and were detectable in 69 of 
70 patients (99%) at the time of relapse. This 
finding argues against the theory that relapse 
commonly arises from wild-type NPM1 preleuke-
Figure 4. Minimal Residual Disease as a Predictor of Outcome in Development and Validation Cohorts.
Shown are the results of stratified log-rank analysis of relapse and overall survival among patients who were found to have minimal residual 
disease (MRD-positive) as compared with those who were found to have no minimal residual disease (MRD-negative) in peripheral blood 
after the second cycle of chemotherapy in both the development and the validation cohorts. The black squares indicate odds ratios, with 
the size of the square proportional to the number of patients in the subgroup. The diamonds indicate the overall values for the develop-
ment and validation cohorts combined. The test of heterogeneity was performed with the use of the chi-square test with one degree of 
freedom. Proportions calculated from numbers of events shown here may not equal the 3-year Kaplan–Meier or cumulative incidence 
rates reported in the text because of variable lengths of follow-up and the occurrence of events beyond 3 years. O−E indicates the ob-
served number of events minus the expected number of events.

Minimal Residual Disease in Standard-Risk AML
mic clones. In the remaining patient, the diag-
nosis of relapse was based on the morphologic 
detection of 9% blasts in a sample of bone mar-
row after the third chemotherapy cycle. Targeted 
sequencing of DNA derived from some of these 
blasts with the use of the 51-gene panel showed 
no mutations, including the FLT3 D835Y mutation 
(in 1066 reads) and the PTPN11 F71L mutation (in 
1261 reads) that were detected before treatment, 
which calls into question the diagnosis of relapse.
To investigate the most effective approach for 
tracking minimal residual disease, digital PCR 
was performed in follow-up samples obtained 
from 53 patients with NPM1-mutated AML who 
had diagnostic DNMT3A or IDH1/2 hotspot mu-
tations and who were in the first complete re-
mission on morphologic analysis and in molecu-
lar remission according to the NPM1-mutated 
RT-qPCR assay. Among 24 patients with DNMT3A 
R882H at diagnosis who received chemotherapy 
alone, all 24 who were tested at a median of 
28 months (range, 2 to 40) showed high-level 
persistence of the mutation (at a median variant 
allele frequency of 21%; range, 1 to 49). Of 
these 24 patients, 16 (67%) remained in the first 
complete remission at a median follow-up of 
38 months (range, 27 to 56). IDH1 R132H was 
detected at follow-up in 1 of 11 patients (9%) at 
a 1% level. IDH2 R140Q was detected in 8 of 18 
patients (44%) who were tested at a median of 
18 months (range, 8 to 45) at a median 2% level 
(range, 0.2 to 42), with 5 of the 8 patients (63%) 
remaining in the first complete remission at 
36 months (range, 28 to 65). Allogeneic stem-
cell transplantation led to the elimination of the 
DNMT3A mutant clone in 8 of 9 patients (89%) 
who were tested (Fig. S5 in Supplementary Ap-
pendix 1).
Discussion
Currently, treatment decisions for young adults 
with AML are based largely on cytogenetic analy-
sis, other well-validated demographic data, and 
very few molecular genetic markers.3-6,35,36 How-
ever, such prognostication does not reflect other 
areas of heterogeneity. The assessment of mini-
mal residual disease may capture some of this 
individual variation but to date is established for 
use only in acute promyelocytic leukemia and 
childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.15,37,38 
We therefore investigated the prognostic value of 
assessment of minimal residual disease in the 
most common molecular subtype of AML.2,7 
Molecular profiling highlighted the molecular 
heterogeneity of AML, with 223 patients cate-
gorized into more than 150 subgroups. In terms 
of genetic changes that were identified, only 
the presence of FLT3-ITD and mutated DNMT3A 
had a significant effect on the outcome on uni-
variate analysis. However, on multivariate analy-
sis, the presence of minimal residual disease (i.e., 
the persistence of NPM1-mutated transcripts) in 
the peripheral blood of patients after the second 
chemotherapy cycle was highly discriminatory 
and the only significant prognostic factor. Among 
patients with a high-risk genotype (FLT3-ITD, 
mutated DNMT3A, or both), negative results on 
RT-qPCR assay of peripheral blood after the sec-
ond chemotherapy cycle distinguished a group 
of patients (79%) with a relatively favorable out-
come (rate of survival, 76%), which has implica-
tions for the value of stem-cell transplantation 
in this group. Even among patients with both 
FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A mutations, a negative re-
sult on RT-qPCR assay of peripheral blood after 
the second chemotherapy cycle was associated 
with a survival rate of 70% at 3 years. Converse-
ly, slow clearance of minimal residual disease 
was used to define a subgroup of patients (10%) 
who had a favorable genotype (i.e., no FLT3-ITD 
and no mutation in DNMT3A) and yet a very poor 
outcome. Typically, these patients would not be 
considered for stem-cell transplantation during 
first complete remission. The prognostic value 
of minimal-residual-disease status in peripheral 
blood after the second chemotherapy cycle was 
confirmed in an independent cohort of patients 
who underwent prospective assessment of mini-
mal residual disease.
Apart from refining risk stratification, assess-
ment of leukemia-specific markers such as mu-
tated NPM1 can be used for sequential monitor-
ing of minimal residual disease to identify 
impending relapse. This strategy has been most 
widely applied in the treatment of patients with 
acute promyelocytic leukemia.15,29,37 However, 
some observers have questioned the suitability 
of the use of mutated NPM1 for monitoring of 
minimal residual disease, since this mutation 
can arise in the context of a preleukemic clone 
characterized by mutations in epigenetic land-
scaping genes (e.g., DNMT3A and IDH1/2) from 
which subsequent relapse may arise.23,24,39 Obser-
vation of variant allele frequencies in relapsing 
disease and results of digital PCR assays show-

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
ing the persistence of DNMT3A and IDH mutations 
at high levels in patients in long-term remission 
indicate that preleukemic clones are frequently 
found in adults who have NPM1-mutated AML 
(Fig. S4 and S5 in Supplementary Appendix 1). 
Our data suggest that although chemotherapy 
can effectively target the mutated NPM1 clone, 
coexisting DNMT3A R882H mutant populations 
are resistant but can be eliminated by stem-cell 
transplantation. However, a recent study identi-
fied DNMT3A mutations in follow-up samples 
from patients in very long-term remission, indi-
cating that elimination may not be essential for 
cure.40 Our findings showed that, regardless of 
clonal architecture, mutated NPM1 provided a 
reliable marker of AML status in the majority of 
patients and that molecular relapse reliably pre-
dicted disease progression.
In conclusion, our study involving a large co-
hort of intensively treated patients showed that 
the presence of minimal residual disease predict-
ed relapse and was superior to the baseline diag-
nostic molecular genetic markers that are currently 
used to guide decisions with respect to stem-cell 
transplantation. Although we did not find a sig-
nificant benefit of transplantation in patients with 
minimal residual disease, the number of patients 
in the analysis was small, since only one third 
of the patients underwent transplantation within 
3 months after a minimal-residual-disease sam-
ple was obtained following the second chemo-
therapy cycle. The question of whether outcomes 
might be improved by more rapid deployment of 
transplantation is being studied in the ongoing 
NCRI AML 19 trial (Current Controlled Trials 
number, ISRCTN78449203). Although it is recog-
nized that the most informative sample source 
(peripheral blood or bone marrow) and time 
points may vary according to treatment protocol, 
these data lend support to a broadening of the 
scope of detection of minimal residual disease 
to assess response and to identify a group of 
patients with a poor prognosis who may be can-
didates for transplantation or new therapies.
