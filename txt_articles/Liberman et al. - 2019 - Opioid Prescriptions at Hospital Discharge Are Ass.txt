Background-—Many patients use opioids for nonmalignant pain, and opioid use in the general population has been associated with
poor long-term outcomes. The use of high-risk medications, including opioid analgesics, may increase the risk of unplanned
healthcare utilization.
Methods and Results-—We performed a nested evaluation in the VICS (Vanderbilt Inpatient Cohort Study) (N=3000) on patients
with an admitting diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome and/or acute decompensated heart failure. Patient enrollment occurred
from October 2011 until December 2015 and involved a single investigational site, Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville,
TN). Of the 2495 eligible patients, 501 (20%) were discharged with an opioid prescription and were predominantly white and men,
with a median age of 59 (interquartile range, 53–67) years. Our primary outcome was unplanned healthcare utilization, which
included emergency department presentation or readmission. Secondary outcomes included mortality and a composite of planned
utilization behaviors: cardiac rehabilitation and provider follow-up within 30 days. Cox proportional hazards models did not show a
statistically significant association with increased unplanned utilization (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.87–1.28) or
mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.84–1.39), compared with those without opioids at discharge. Patients discharged
with opioids were less likely to complete planned healthcare utilization (adjusted odds ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52–0.91).
Conclusions-—There are decreased odds of planned healthcare utilization among patients with acute coronary syndrome and acute
decompensated heart failure discharged with opioid medication. It is imperative to understand how opioid use can affect a
patient’s relationship with the healthcare system. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2019;8:e010664. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.118.010664.)

A
fter hospital discharge, unplanned healthcare utilization
(ie, hospital readmission or emergency department
use) is both common and costly. Almost 20% of Medicare
beneficiaries are readmitted because of any cause within
30 days of their index discharge, with an approximate
annual cost to Medicare totaling $17.4 billion.1 Certain
patients are at the highest risk for unplanned hospital
readmissions because of both disease severity and the
complexity of the disease process. Patients with acute
coronary syndrome (ACS) and acute decompensated heart
failure (ADHF) are high-risk populations who are often
readmitted, with 15%2 and 23%3 30-day readmission rates,
respectively. Studies focused on multidisciplinary interven-
tions after hospitalization for acute cardiac events have
demonstrated reduced hospital readmission in patients with
ACS or ADHF if there is early provider follow-up after
discharge.4–6

 patients with history of prehospital opioid use was also
demonstrated by Rogal and colleagues in patients undergo-
ing liver transplantation.9
Cardiovascular toxicity related to opioid exposure was
demonstrated in an observational cohort of 42 000 patients
with a 2.2-fold increased association with coronary disease in
the opioid-dependent population compared with nonusers.10
In a study published by Gomes et al,11 opioids were linked to
mortality in a dose-dependent manner in patients with
nonmalignant
pain.
Compared
with
patients
receiving
<20 mg morphine daily, mortality was increased, with an
odds ratio (OR) of 1.92 (95% CI, 1.30–2.85) for patients with
daily morphine doses of 5 to 99 mg and an OR of 2.04 (95%
CI, 1.28–3.24) for patients with daily morphine doses of 100
to 199 mg.11
Given that opioid use is increasingly common and has been
related to mortality and cardiac toxicity, our aim was to test
the hypothesis that among patients with ACS or ADHF with a
discharge opioid prescription, there would be an increased
association with unplanned healthcare utilization and mortal-
ity and a decreased association with planned healthcare
utilization compared with those discharged without a pre-
scription for opioid analgesics.

Study Design and Overview of Parent Study
This study is a nested evaluation of opioid prescriptions
within a prospective cohort of patients with heart disease,
the VICS (Vanderbilt Inpatient Cohort Study). The VICS was a
prospective cohort study composed of adult patients hospi-
talized for ACS and/or ADHF. Patient enrollment occurred
from October 2011 until December 2015 and involved a
single investigational site, Vanderbilt University Medical
Center. The purpose of the VICS was to investigate the
impact of social and behavioral determinants on postdis-
charge health outcomes, such as readmission, quality of life,
and mortality. The institutional review board of Vanderbilt
University Medical Center approved this study, and each
patient provided written informed consent and received $30
for study participation. A detailed description of the VICS
method has been previously published.12
Briefly, VICS patients were recruited if they were 18 years
or older and admitted (index hospitalization) with ACS and/or
ADHF. Using standardized diagnosis criteria, staff screened
patients via electronic medical record review, and a clinician
confirmed eligibility. During the index hospitalization, patients
completed detailed study questionnaires on social and
behavioral risk factors, medication use, and health status.
Follow-up of patients occurred after hospital discharge via
telephone interviews at 2 to 3, 30, and 90 days. Patients were
retained at a high rate during follow-up, with 88.0% at 30 days
and 86.4% at 90 days after discharge in the parent study.
Healthcare utilization for the 90-day period after discharge
was abstracted from charts and included any hospital facility
used by the patient. Mortality data were assessed through
March 8, 2017 (1.5–4.5 years after discharge).
Study Sample
Our primary study sample included all patients enrolled in the
VICS parent study (N=3000). We then excluded patients who
had a hospital stay of <24 hours (eg, brief hospitalization for
cardiac catheterization), died during the index hospitalization,
underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or used
hospice care. We also excluded subjects with incomplete
covariates (N=23).
Exposure: Opioid Prescription at Discharge
We defined the exposure as the presence of an opioid
medication on the discharge medication list. All opioid
formulations were included in our analysis (Table S1).
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Patients with acute coronary syndrome and/or acute
decompensated heart failure who were discharged with an
opioid medication prescription were statistically less likely
to complete planned healthcare utilization, defined as a
composite of primary care physician follow-up and partic-
ipation in cardiac rehabilitation within 30 days of hospital
discharge.
• There was a nonsignificant association among patients with
acute coronary syndrome and/or acute decompensated
heart failure discharged with an opioid medication prescrip-
tion and the outcomes of mortality and unplanned health-
care utilization, defined as either emergency department
visit or hospital readmission.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• In addition to the national focus on opioid-related overdose
and mortality, it is imperative to understand how opioid use
can affect a patient’s relationship with the healthcare
system.
• An acute medical event, such as acute coronary syndrome
or acute decompensated heart failure, represents a unique
opportunity to reevaluate a patient’s medication regimen;
reductions in opioid medication prescriptions at discharge
may increase primary care physician follow-up and partic-
ipation in cardiac rehabilitation.

Opioid Prescriptions and Healthcare Utilization
Liberman et al

 For opioids prescribed at discharge, we used the opioid
name, dose, and frequency to calculate daily oral morphine
equivalents (OMEs) and applied the published morphine
equivalent conversion factor specific for each opioid medica-
tion (Table S1).13 For unscheduled, “as-needed” opioids, dose
was calculated as the maximum dose possible, as prescribed
on
the
discharge
medication
reconciliation
list.
In
an
additional set of analyses, the total daily opioid dose was
calculated as the sum of OMEs for both scheduled and as-
needed opioids and categorized into 3 OME groups: <50 mg/d,
≥50 mg/d, or none. Patients who had incomplete opioid
information (missing dose, frequency, or type) were excluded
from dose analyses.
Outcomes: Unplanned Healthcare Utilization,
Death, and Planned Healthcare Utilization
The primary outcome was time from index hospital discharge
until unplanned healthcare utilization within 90 days after
discharge. Unplanned utilization was defined as either emer-
gency department visit or hospital readmission. Patients could
reach the primary outcome only once and were removed from
the risk pool once reaching the outcome. Patients who died
within 90 days after discharge without reaching the outcome
were censored from the utilization analysis at the time of death.
The 2 secondary outcomes consisted of time to all-cause
mortality and completion of planned healthcare utilization.
Time to all-cause mortality was calculated from index hospital
discharge through the end of follow-up (March 8, 2017).
Mortality data were obtained using a combination of data
from the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File,14
follow-up interview calls, documentation in the electronic
health record, family report, and obituaries. During the study,
the Death Master File was downloaded monthly and linked to
patient records. The importance of using multiple sources to
adjudicate vital status has been shown previously in literature
and has shown a nearly 100% ascertainment of patient
mortality in US-born individuals.15–17
Completion of planned healthcare utilization consisted of a
composite of physician follow-up within 30 days of the index
hospitalization discharge and, for those referred to cardiac
rehabilitation, participation in at least 1 cardiac rehabilitation
session within 30 days. Patients who were eligible for cardiac
rehabilitation were classified as a failure of planned health-
care utilization if they either missed their rehabilitation
session or did not complete provider follow-up within
30 days. It was assumed that all patients admitted with
ACS or ADHF were expected to follow up with a healthcare
provider (typically cardiology or primary care) within 30 days
after discharge. Patients who died within 30 days of the index
hospital discharge were not included in this analysis. Data on
unplanned and planned healthcare utilization were obtained
via self-reported telephone calls with the patient or family and
verified by chart abstraction. Cardiac rehabilitation centers
were contacted directly by a research assistant to validate
patient participation among those who had referrals for
cardiac rehabilitation.
Covariates
Study covariates were age, sex (male or female), race (white,
black, or other), admission diagnosis (ACS, ADHF, or both),
income, socioeconomic status (whether the patient was
employed or unemployed; years of education; and income
categorized into 5 levels), presence of a regular healthcare
provider (yes or no), presence of opioid prescription on
admission medication list (yes or no), Elixhauser score,18
length of stay for index hospitalization, number of hospital
admissions in prior 12 months, and presence of b blocker or
aspirin prescriptions at index hospitalization discharge. Dis-
charge disposition (eg, home or skilled nursing facility) was
not included because most patients were discharged home
after hospitalization.
Statistical Analysis
Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze time to
unplanned healthcare utilization (within 90 days after dis-
charge) and time to death for patients with opioids on the
discharge medication reconciliation list versus patients with
no opioids (referent), adjusting for the covariates listed above.
The examination of log-log plots suggested that the propor-
tional hazards assumption was reasonable for both models.
To estimate the odds of completing planned healthcare
utilization (within 30 days after discharge) by opioid exposure
group, we used a logistic regression model adjusting for the
same covariates. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) or adjusted
ORs and 95% CIs are reported. All analyses were conducted
using R (http://www.r-project.org).
Sensitivity and Subgroup Analyses
Our main analyses relied on direct covariate adjustment to
reduce potential confounding. Because the success of this
approach depends heavily on the specification of the outcome
model, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in a weighted
pseudocohort constructed using propensity scores. Cohorts
constructed using propensity scores balance the covariates
by assigning weights to patients in each group so that the
weighted groups closely resemble each other, thus reducing
dependence on the specification of the outcome model. In
particular, we used propensity score matching weights,19
which give the most weight to the patients who most closely
resemble those in the opposite group, so that the weighted

 cohort represents patients who could have conceivably been
in either group: discharged with opioid prescription or
discharged without opioid prescription. Weighting success in
the pseudocohort was evaluated using both a table of patient
characteristics and a standardized mean differences plot
(Table 1 and Figure S1).
The presence of a prehospitalization opioid without the
presence of a discharge opioid may result in drug exposure
misclassification because patients with access to opioid
medications before their index hospitalization may continue
to use these medications after hospitalization even if not
prescribed at discharge. To address this concern, we con-
ducted a second sensitivity analysis by redefining our opioid
user group to include patients who had an opioid on either their
preindex hospitalization medication list or their discharge
medication list; we conducted a third sensitivity analysis in
which we redefined our opioid user group to include only those
patients who had an opioid on their prehospitalization medi-
cation list. In addition, because we were concerned about a
temporal effect on cohort enrollment, we conducted a
sensitivity analysis in which we included patient year of
hospital discharge from index hospitalization. Finally, for the 2
outcomes for which death could be considered a competing
risk, we conducted sensitivity analyses in which we incorpo-
rated death into a composite end point.
We conducted subgroup analyses stratifying by patient age
(≥65 or <65 years), sex (male or female), and race (white or
nonwhite) to assess associations between opioid prescription
and planned healthcare utilization within each of these groups.
Sensitivity to Unmeasured Confounders
We evaluated the sensitivity of our statistically significant
results to the presence of an unmeasured binary confounder.
For the outcome of planned healthcare utilization, a potential
unmeasured binary confounder, such as frailty, may decrease
planned healthcare utilization and may also increase use of
opioid medications.20,21 We considered hypothetical con-
founder-outcome relationships of different strengths and
determined the prevalence among opioid and nonopioid
users in which our analysis would be inconclusive at the 5%
level.
Results
There were 3000 patients enrolled in the VICS cohort. Of these,
505 patients were excluded (length of stay <24 hours, N=19;
died during index hospitalization, N=23; coronary artery bypass
graft surgery during index hospitalization, N=425; hospice
care, N=15; and incomplete covariate data, N=23) for a sample
of 2495. There were 501 (20.1%) identified as having a
discharge opioid, and 1994 (79.9%) had no discharge opioids
(Figure 1). Of the 501 opioid users, 56 were missing elements
of the discharge prescription needed to calculate the OME
dose and were not included in the dose analysis.

 Patient Characteristics
Patients discharged with opioids were predominantly white
(81%), with a median age of 59 (interquartile range [IQR], 53–
67) years. Patients discharged without opioid medications
were predominantly white (84%) and men (60.0%), with a
median age of 61 (IQR, 52–69) years. Admission diagnosis
was comparable in both groups (ACS, 56% versus 59%; ADHF,
37% versus 35%; and both ACS and ADHF during the index
hospitalization, 7% versus 6%). Patients with opioids at
discharge had a higher median Elixhauser comorbidity score
(11 [IQR, 4–18] versus 8 [IQR, 2–16]) compared with
nonusers. Patients discharged with opioid medication were
more likely to have a prehospital prescription for opioid
medication (73.7% versus 11.7%, Table 1). On discharge from
the index hospitalization, more patients who were discharged
with an opioid were also prescribed aspirin (81.6% versus
53.8%) and a b blocker (81.5% versus 53.8%) compared with
those not prescribed an opioid. Patients discharged with
opioid medication had higher baseline median (IQR) Patient
Health Questionnaire scores compared with those not
prescribed opioids on discharge (9 [5–13] versus 7 [3–11]).
Primary Outcome: Time to Unplanned Healthcare
Utilization
There were 235 events (71 emergency department visits and
164 hospital readmissions) among patients with a discharge
prescription for opioids and 775 events (254 emergency
department visits and 521 hospital readmissions) among
patients without a postdischarge prescription for opioids.
Cox proportional hazards analysis adjusting for covariates
yielded an increased point estimate of unplanned utilization
for patients discharged with opioids (aHR, 1.06; 95% CI,
0.87–1.28; Table 2 and Figure 2A); however, CIs were wide.
The analyses using categorized opioid dose demonstrated
that for OME dose <50 mg/d (aHR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.83–
1.28) and OME dose ≥50 mg/d (aHR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.89–
1.60)
there
remained
an
increased
point
estimate
of
unplanned healthcare utilization compared with nonusers
(Table 3 and Figure 3).
Secondary Outcomes: Time to Death and Planned
Healthcare Utilization
In the opioid group, 26.1% of patients died, compared with
21.7% in the nonuser group. Cox proportional hazards analysis
adjusting for covariates yielded an increased hazard of death
for patients discharged with opioids (aHR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.84–
1.39; Table 2 and Figure 2B), but again the results were not
significant at the 5% level. Evaluation of the association
between categorized opioid dose and time to death demon-
strated an aHR of 1.06 (95% CI, 0.79–1.41) for OME dose
<50 mg/d and 1.34 (95% CI, 0.92–1.94) for OME dose
≥50 mg/d compared with nonusers (Table 3 and Figure 3).
Among the patients who received opioid prescription at
discharge and were still alive 30 days after discharge
(N=499), 300 (60.1%) did not complete planned healthcare
utilization within 30 days; this included 239 of 499 (47.9%)
who did not follow up with a provider within 30 days and 130
of 167 (77.8%) who did not complete any sessions of cardiac
rehabilitation. Among nonusers alive at 30 days (N=1963),
1080 (55.0%) did not complete planned utilization. There were

 816 of 1963 (41.6%) who did not complete provider follow-up
within 30 days and 481 of 696 (69.1%) who did not complete
any sessions of cardiac rehabilitation. Logistic regression
adjusting for covariates yielded decreased odds of planned
utilization for patients discharged with opioids (adjusted OR,
0.69; 95% CI, 0.52–0.91; Table 2). The analysis of the
relationship between categorized opioid dose and planned
healthcare utilization demonstrated an adjusted OR of 0.76
(95% CI, 0.56–1.04) for OME doses <50 mg/d and 0.62 (95%
CI, 0.40–0.97) for OME doses ≥50 mg/d compared with
nonusers (Table 3 and Figure 3).
Sensitivity and Subgroup Analysis
For the sensitivity analyses conducted using propensity score
weighting, the success of the weighting approach in balancing
the 2 groups can be seen in the plot of standard mean
differences (Figure S1). Results for the weighted analysis were
consistent with results from the main analysis, as were the
results from the 2 sensitivity analyses in which we reclassified
our exposure variable, first to include the presence of
preindex and/or postindex hospitalization opioid prescrip-
tions (Table S2) and second to include only prehospitalization
prescriptions regardless of postdischarge opioid prescription
(Table S3). The results of the sensitivity analyses in which we
included patient year of hospital discharge from index
hospitalization were also consistent with the results from
the main analysis for all outcomes (Table S4).
In our primary analysis (time to unplanned healthcare
utilization), death acts as a competing risk. Of 2495 patients,
however, only 18 died within the 90-day window without
having first experienced unplanned healthcare utilization.
Because this number was so low, we treated these patients as
censored in our main analysis. The Aalen-Johansen plot of the
cumulative incidence of unplanned utilization, taking death
into account as a competing risk (shown in Figure S2), is
nearly identical to Figure 2A, which treats death as censoring.
In addition, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we
used a composite end point of unplanned utilization or death
within 90 days. To account for death in our analysis of
planned healthcare utilization within 30 days, we conducted a
sensitivity analysis in which we included all patients and
treated patients who died before completing their planned
healthcare utilization as “failures.” The results of both
composite end point analyses were close to our original
results (Table S5).
Subgroup analyses revealed consistent point estimates for
planned healthcare utilization behavior for all subgroups
analyzed, with the estimate remaining statistically significant
in the 2 largest subgroups, white race and male sex (Table S6
and Figure S3).
Sensitivity to Unmeasured Confounders
For the planned healthcare utilization outcome, we assessed
the sensitivity of our results to a hypothetical unmeasured
binary confounder. We found that a confounder with an OR of
0.8 (such that it lowers the odds of completing planned
healthcare utilization) would need to be at least 1.7 times as
prevalent in the exposed (opioid) group to render the analysis
inconclusive at the 5% level. A stronger confounder associated
with an OR of 0.6 would need to be at least 1.2 times as
prevalent in the exposed group to have the same effect.
Discussion
Our results extend the current literature on factors that
influence postdischarge follow-up and treatment adherence.
This study found a statistically significant association between

 the

discharge
and
decreased odds of patients completing outpatient physician
follow-up and cardiac rehabilitation. Both planned healthcare
utilization outcomes are evidenced-based recommendations
that reduce the risk of readmission and mortality after an
acute cardiac event.
There are many possible mechanisms for these associa-
tions. Reduced planned utilization may be inherent to the
medication itself; may be caused by lethargy, physical instabil-
ity, or medication nonadherence22; or may be secondary to
associated diseases, such as depression.23,24 A prospective
study of 355 patients with chronic low back pain demonstrated
that those with prescriptions equivalent to >50 OMEs per day
had 2.7 times the odds of an elevated depressive score relative
to patients with low back pain who did not use opioids.25 This
relationship to depression has been shown to increase patients’
no-show rates to planned healthcare appointments, increase
readmission rates, and decrease adherence to disease self-
management.26–29
Although
our
primary
results
were
not
statistically
significant at the 5% level, point estimates were consistent
with prior research on opioid use and patient harm.8,30,31
We found that patients discharged with opioids had a
higher rate of death (26.1% versus 21.7%), and analyses
using categorized opioid dose demonstrated results consis-
tent with prior literature on increased OMEs and risk to
patients.11,32,33
We demonstrated an association with mortality and
unplanned healthcare utilization at OME ≥50 mg/d. OME
dose ≥50 mg/d was also associated with reduced odds of
planned healthcare utilization (adjusted OR, 0.62; 95% CI,
0.40–0.97) compared with patients without opioid prescrip-
tions at discharge. Multiple studies have shown reduced
opioid dosing improves pain outcomes and hospital readmis-
sion, and our findings further support these studies.34,35
Our study does have some limitations. First, we were unable
to ascertain the amount of opioid each patient actually
ingested. Our assessment of opioids reflects the total daily

 dose of opioids prescribed to each patient at discharge and
does not account for opioids that may have been in the home
before the hospitalization. Thus, there is potential for exposure
misclassification; however, sensitivity analyses incorporating
prehospital opioids into the exposure definition were per-
formed, and results were consistent with those from the main
analyses. In addition, our data set did not capture information
on opioid prescription duration, which may have influenced
likelihood of return for follow-up care. Second, the use of
patient-reported outcomes could have resulted in outcome
misclassification for both unplanned and planned healthcare
utilization if patients in 1 group were more or less likely to
report rehospitalization or cardiac rehabilitation participation.
Approximately 86% of the patients completed the interview
series at 90-day postindex hospital discharge. We supple-
mented these interviews using objective patient records and
have no reason to suspect that outcome reporting was
differential by opioid exposure status. Third, there remains
the possibility of unmeasured confounding. An unmeasured
confounder, such as frailty, could have been associated with
both prescription of an opioid and the decreased likelihood of
planned healthcare utilization. Our sensitivity analysis explor-
ing the possible impact of unmeasured confounders suggests
that our results are robust to at least some degree of imbalance
in unmeasured confounders. Fourth, because of changes to the
Death Master File, adjudicating vital status was necessary to
obtain the most accurate vital status possible; however, it may
still underestimate the vital status of patients in our cohort.
Finally, the study was performed in a single healthcare system
with an 80% white study sample and may not be generalizable
to other healthcare settings or populations.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates some of the
possible mechanisms by which opioid analgesics impact
patients with cardiac disease. Our study identified point
estimates consistent with our hypothesis that increased
mortality and hospital readmissions occur in cardiac patients
prescribed opioid medications; however, we were not able to
show statistical significance at the 5% level. Furthermore, we
demonstrated a statistically significant finding of decreased
odds of planned healthcare utilization among patients admit-
ted with either ACS or ADHF and discharged with opioid
medications. This has ramifications on the debate surrounding
the current opioid crisis. In addition to the national focus on
opioid-related overdose and mortality, it is imperative to
understand how opioid use can affect a patient’s relationship
with the healthcare system. An acute medical event, such as

 ACS or ADHF, represents a unique opportunity to reevaluate a
patient’s medication regimen. Our study supports reductions
in opioid prescriptions to improve planned healthcare utiliza-
tion behaviors. Further research is necessary to understand
opioid use and its association with patient self-care to
improve clinical outcomes.
