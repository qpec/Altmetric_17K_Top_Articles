SUMMARY
Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment modu-
late cancer progression and are attractive therapeu-
tic targets. Macrophages and T cells are key
components of the microenvironment, yet their phe-
notypes and relationships in this ecosystem and to
clinical outcomes are ill defined. We used mass
cytometry with extensive antibody panels to perform
in-depth immune profiling of samples from 73 clear
cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients and five
healthy controls. In 3.5 million measured cells, we
identified 17 tumor-associated macrophage pheno-
types, 22 T cell phenotypes, and a distinct immune
composition correlated with progression-free sur-
vival, thereby presenting an in-depth human atlas
of the immune tumor microenvironment in this dis-
ease. This study revealed potential biomarkers and
targets for immunotherapy development and vali-
dated tools that can be used for immune profiling
of other tumor types.
INTRODUCTION
Cells of the adaptive and innate immune systems infiltrate the
tumor microenvironment (TME) and form an ecosystem that
modulates all aspects of tumor development (Grivennikov
et al., 2010). T cells are the most abundant and best-character-
ized population in the TME of solid tumors (Galon et al., 2006;
Vesely et al., 2011). CD4+ helper T cells and cytotoxic CD8+
T cells can prevent tumor growth by targeting antigenic tumor
cells, and high numbers of activated CD8+ T cells are associated
with good prognosis in various cancers (Vesely et al., 2011).
Tumors can lose their immunogenicity, however, and the tumor
milieu can suppress T cell responses. Suppression may involve
regulatory T cells, which secrete immunosuppressive cytokines
and myeloid and stromal cells, which modulate immune check-
points by activation of co-inhibitory receptors (e.g., PD-1,
Tim-3, and CTLA-4) on T cells resulting in dysfunctional, ex-
hausted T cell phenotypes (Speiser et al., 2016; Wherry and Kur-
achi, 2015).
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are another key im-
mune population in the TME that can either block or facilitate tu-
mor growth (Kitamura et al., 2015; Sica et al., 2008). Distinct TAM
subsets can induce or repress anti-tumor immunity, angiogen-
esis, and cell migration (Murray et al., 2014; Qian and Pollard,
2010; Quatromoni and Eruslanov, 2012). TAM phenotypes
are highly plastic, and recent reports show that the model
distinguishing between classically polarized anti-tumor M1 and
alternatively polarized pro-tumor M2 subtypes incompletely ac-
counts for the phenotypic diversity in vivo (Ginhoux et al., 2016).
T cell and TAM phenotypes are attractive biomarkers (Daud
et al., 2016; Galon et al., 2014; Ostuni et al., 2015), and both
T cells and TAMs show promise as therapeutic targets (Maus
and June, 2016; Ries et al., 2014; Shin and Ribas, 2015). Treat-
ment with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies can overcome
T cell exhaustion in different cancer types (Shin and Ribas,
2015), and clinical trials are investigating the effect of depletion of

 TAMs and the repolarization of pro-tumor TAMs into anti-tumor
TAMs (Pyonteck et al., 2013; Ries et al., 2014). Broader use of
T cells and macrophages as biomarkers and drug targets has
been hindered by the fact that human TAM and T cell pheno-
types and relationships among them in the TME have not been
comprehensively characterized. Characterization of TAMs in
the TME has focused on a handful of markers (Komohara
et al., 2013; Reinartz et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2015), and gene
expression profiling has been done in bulk tissues or total macro-
phage populations (Dannenmann et al., 2013; Doedens et al.,
2010). Single-cell RNA sequencing provides high-dimensional,
single-cell data (Tirosh et al., 2016), yet the low numbers of cells
analyzed mean that this technology currently cannot capture
cellular complexity present in a tumor and is not yet suitable
for studies of large patient cohorts.
In order to comprehensively analyze the immune landscape in
the TME, millions of cells from human tumors must be character-
ized by simultaneous analysis of dozens of markers (Noy and
Pollard, 2014; Quatromoni and Eruslanov, 2012). Mass cytome-
try enables the quantification of more than 50 readouts at the sin-
gle-cell level by combining metal isotope-labeled antibodies with
mass spectrometry detection (Bandura et al., 2009; Ornatsky
et al., 2010). With its ability to analyze millions of cells in a short
time at low cost, mass cytometry represents the method of
choice to assess the phenotypic diversity of T cells and TAMs
present in the TME in large patient cohorts.
In this study, we present a mass cytometry-based atlas of
the immune landscape in tumor samples from 73 clear cell
renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients and five normal kidney
controls. ccRCC is a common and lethal uro-genital cancer
(Koul et al., 2011). Around 50% of ccRCC patients develop me-
tastases despite treatment, and less than 10% of these patients
survive 5 years. Targeted treatments such as tyrosine kinase in-
hibitors are only palliative (Koul et al., 2011), but novel checkpoint
immunotherapies show considerable promise in some patients
(Joseph et al., 2017). Thus new avenues to guide immuno-
therapy-based treatments are urgently needed (Shinohara and
Abe, 2015). We used unsupervised computational approaches
to reveal an unprecedented phenotypic complexity in TMEs in
ccRCC patient samples. Our data expand the view of T cell
immunosuppression phenotypes, suggest links between a TAM
phenotype and populations of regulatory T cells and CD8+ immu-
nosuppressed T cells, and identify an immune cell composition
within the TME that is correlated with progression-free survival.
RESULTS
In-Depth Immunophenotyping of ccRCC Tumor Samples
Using Mass Cytometry
We performed a large-scale mass cytometry analysis of 73 tu-
mor samples from patients with all grades of ccRCC and five
healthy matched kidney samples (Figure 1A; Table S1). We
stained cells with two antibody panels created for this study (Fig-
ures 1B and 1C; Table S2; STAR Methods). Since TAM pheno-
types are little characterized in human, the TAM panel originated
from an antibody screen (Figures 1B, S1A, and S1B), whereas
the T cell panel (Figure 1C) was designed to identify different
populations of naive, memory, effector, regulatory, and ex-
hausted T cells. Comparison of mass cytometry to flow cytome-
try showed an average correlation of 0.88, confirming the
reliability of the mass cytometry data (Figure S1C). Both panels
included markers for the identification of B cells, natural killer
cells, plasma cells, granulocytes, and myeloid cells. The samples
were barcoded (Bodenmiller et al., 2012; Zunder et al., 2015),
and standards analyzed on each plate (Figure S2A) demon-
strated that the data were highly consistent across plates (Fig-
ures S2B and S2C).
Immune Landscape in ccRCC
To generate a comprehensive view of the immune ecosystem of
each tumor, we generated two-dimensional maps of the data us-
ing the dimensionality reduction algorithm t-SNE (for gating
strategy, see Figure S2D) (Amir et al., 2013; van der Maaten
and Hinton, 2008). This analysis showed a strong overlap be-
tween tumors of all grades (Figures 2A and 2B). To partition
the cells into distinct phenotypes, we applied the PhenoGraph
clustering algorithm (Levine et al., 2015), which takes into ac-
count phenotypic adjacency of cells in high-dimensional space
and is suited for clustering of single-cell data (Levine et al.,
2015). This analysis identified the main immune cell types in
both T cell and TAM data (Figures 2C–2F, S3A, and S3B). Con-
tour plots usually used to identify cell populations in manual
gates confirmed identities (Figure 2G). PhenoGraph analyses re-
vealed highly similar frequencies across plates and across
panels, highlighting the robustness of the dataset and analysis
(Figures S3C and S3D).
T cells were the main immune cell population in the ccRCC
TME, with a mean of 51% across samples (Figure 2H, left panel)
(Geissler et al., 2015). The mean frequencies of myeloid cells,
natural killer cells, and B cells were 31%, 9%, and 4%, respec-
tively (Figure 2H, left panel). Granulocytes were present at very
low levels in all but one sample. Plasma cells constituted a minor
fraction in most samples. A double-positive CD8+/CD4+ popula-
tion was observed in many samples, reaching up to 25% of the
T cell compartment in some samples (Figure 2H, right panel).
T Cell Characterization Reveals Various Phenotypes
Associated with Immunosuppression
When

t-SNE
and
PhenoGraph find dominant phenotypes; finer granularity of
structures is found by separate analyses of these dominant phe-
notypes. To exhaustively map cell phenotypes, we performed
additional PhenoGraph analyses focused on each T cell and
TAM subset defined in our initial analyses (Figures 2E and 2F).
The expression profiles of the T cell PhenoGraph clusters were
visualized in a heatmap (Figure 3A) and heterogeneity in marker
level was assessed at the single-cell level using t-SNE (Figures
3B and 3C). This approach led to the identification of eight
CD4+ phenotypes, 11 CD8+ phenotypes, one CD4+/CD8+ dou-
ble-positive phenotype and one double-negative phenotype
(Figure 3A). We observed highly similar phenotypes among
CD4+ and CD8+ subsets including cells expressing CD127+,
CD11b+, PD-1�/CD11b�, and CTLA-4+ (Figure 3D). Regulatory
T cells (T-6) were mostly observed among the CD4+ subset
and were defined by the co-expression of CD25, Foxp3, and
CTLA-4 and the absence of CD127.

Subsets with similar levels of PD-1
differed in expression of activation markers
and co-stimulatory receptors (Figure 3E).
The cluster T-1 had the same expression
pattern as T-0 but markers were expressed
at lower levels. The T-1 cells could corre-
spond to precursors of a fully exhausted
T-0 population, since during exhaustion
inhibitory receptor expression progres-
sively increases (Wherry, 2011). The other
PD-1+ clusters (T-7, T-5, T-16, T-9, and
T-19) were characterized by the absence
of Tim-3 expression and by heterogeneity
in expression of markers such as 4-1BB,
CD38, CTLA-4, and OX-40. Except for
T-16 and T-19, all clusters expressed
CD38, a marker not previously associated
with T cell exhaustion in cancer. Flow
cytometry and transcriptome analysis of
sorted populations confirmed co-expres-
sion of PD-1 with CD38 (Figures S4A–
S4D; Table S3).
Within the CD4+ T cell subset, one PD-1+
population
(T-18)
was
observed
(Fig-
ure 3E). Cells in the T-18 cluster co-ex-
pressed CD38 and Tim-3, but ICOS and
4-1BB were at lower levels than in the T-0
cluster. Populations of CD4+ cells that ex-
press CTLA-4 (T-13) and OX-40 (T-17)
were also identified, but the level of PD-1
was lower on these cells than on their
CD8+ counterparts (Figure 3E).
The marker expression pattern of the
double-positive PD-1+ cluster T-8 was
highly similar to that of the T-0 cluster
(Figure 3E). Both cytotoxic and immuno-
suppressive roles have been suggested for this phenotype
(Overgaard et al., 2015). In our ccRCC samples, this population
exhibits an exhausted phenotype. Neither LAG-3 nor GITR were
observed in any T cell population investigated, suggesting that
the expression of these modulatory receptors is context specific
(Figure 3A).
When cluster frequencies were analyzed based on tumor
grade (Figures 3F and S4E), we observed that normal samples

 were positive for CD4+ central memory T cells (T-2), CD4+ and
CD8+ effector memory cells (T-3, T-4), and CD8+/CD45RA+
T cells (T-14). Regulatory T cells (T-6) and PD-1+ clusters (T-0,
T-1) were virtually absent from normal samples but were present
in ccRCC samples at different levels depending on grade and in
metastatic samples (Figures 3F and S4E). Collectively, these
data reveal an unexpected phenotypic diversity among PD-1-ex-
pressing T cells present in samples from ccRCC tumors.
High-Resolution Analysis of TAMs Reveals Phenotypic
Diversity of Tissue-Resident and Tumor-Specific
Macrophages
TAM populations were characterized by more subtle differences
in marker expression than T cell populations and were more
challenging to categorize. To ensure a robust set of clusters,
we developed a subsampling procedure to obtain a consensus
PhenoGraph solution (STAR Methods) that led to the identifica-
tion of 17 TAM phenotypes (Figures 4A and 4B). Visualization
of single cells on the t-SNE map confirmed a continuum of
expression for most markers; a few (CD123, CD169, CD163,
CD204, and CD206) had bimodal expression (Figure 4C).
Others have suggested that macrophages form a spectrum of
phenotypically related cell subsets (Ginhoux et al., 2016; Murray
et al., 2014; Xue et al., 2014). To identify potential relationships
among the TAM phenotypes, we used diffusion mapping, a
method originally proposed to align cells along branching devel-
opmental paths (Haghverdi et al., 2015). Blood monocytes were
included as a reference population. The resulting three-dimen-
sional diffusion plot has three main branches (Figure 4D). The
TAM groupings on these branches are consistent with the
PhenoGraph clusters.
The first branch mostly consists of blood monocytes and the
M-15 cluster, characterized by intermediate levels of HLA-DR,
CD68, and CD64 and high levels of CD36 and CD11b (Figures
4A and S5A). This phenotype suggests that the M-15 cluster cor-
responds to circulating CD14+ monocytes from the tumor vascu-
lature. Consistent with this hypothesis, this cluster was present
in healthy samples and across all tumor grades (Figure 4E).
This first branch expands along diffusion component one (DC1)
to include clusters M-1 and M-14 (Figure 4D). Cells along this
component were characterized by a progressive loss of CD36
and CD11b and increases in HLA-DR, CD4, CD68, and CD64
(Figure 4F), a trend culminating with cluster M-5, which showed
one of the highest DC1 values. This marker regulation is consis-
tent with changes observed during the monocyte to macrophage
transition that occurs upon migration into tissue (Ostuni et al.,
2015). Our data also suggest that CD54 and CD81 are associ-
ated with this transition.
The second branch was almost exclusively formed by cells of
the M-16 cluster. The M-16 phenotype is consistent with that of
inflammatory CD16+ circulating monocytes (Figure S5B). This
cluster was present in healthy samples and across all tumor
grades (Figure 4E).
The third branch has a complex structure (Figures 4D, S5C,
and S5D). One grouping involves clusters M-5, M-11, M-12,
and M-13 (Figures 4D and S5C). These clusters displayed the
highest levels of HLA-DR, CD68, and CD64 of all clusters and
no expression of CD11b or CD36, suggesting that the cells
were mature (Ostuni et al., 2015). Consistent with this, these
clusters were only present in tumors of grade II and higher (Fig-
ures 4E and S5E). These clusters were characterized by a previ-
ously unrecognized diversity of combinations of pro- (CD163,
CD204, and CD206) and anti-tumor (CD169) TAM markers (Fig-
ure 4G; Table S4). M-5 and M-13 clusters expressed only
CD204, the M-12 cluster was positive for CD204 and CD206,
and the M-11 cluster was positive for all four markers. The M-5
cells also expressed high levels of CD38, a marker exclusively
found upon M1 polarization in murine macrophages (Jablonski
et al., 2015). Thus, macrophages in the TME can co-express
anti-tumor and pro-tumor markers.
Another group in the third branch involves M-0, M-10, and M-7
clusters (Figures 4D and S5D). M-0 and M-10 clusters had high
levels of CD206 expression. M-0 cells expressed low levels of
CD163, CD169, and CD204, whereas M-10 cells were negative
for these markers. M-0 and M-10 clusters were present in
healthy tissues (Figure 4E), suggesting that these clusters corre-
spond to tissue-resident macrophages.
Analysis of the Immune Landscape across Patients
To investigate heterogeneity of immune cell signatures across
ccRCC patients, we determined frequencies of identified T cell
and TAM phenotypes relative to parent populations for each in-
dividual patient. We performed a hierarchical clustering based
on CD8+ T cells to order patients by compositional similarity (Fig-
ure 5, left). This analysis suggests compositional patterns in that
in samples with the highest amount of T-0 and T-1 PD-1+ cells,
the T-4, T-5, and T-11 populations, which express little or no
PD-1, were absent, suggesting that these T cell phenotypes
might be mutually exclusive. The analysis of the CD4+ T cells
(Figure 5, middle) only revealed subtle patterns and no patterns
were visible among the TAM clusters, which displayed the high-
est variability across and within samples (Figure 5, right). To
confirm this visual observation, the Kullback-Leibler divergence
of each patient composition relative to the mean composition
was computed for TAM and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compart-
ments. Patients were most heterogeneous in their TAM compo-
sition, followed by CD8 composition, and were most uniform in
their CD4 composition (Figure S6). Overall, these results suggest
that relationships among the analyzed cell types can be identi-
fied within the TME.
Systematic Correlation Analysis Reveals Relationships
in the TME
To systematically quantify relationships between immune cell
populations present in the TME, we calculated the frequencies
for each immune cell phenotype of each individual tumor (Fig-
ure 6A) and used these frequencies in correlation analyses de-
signed to exclude outlier effects (STAR Methods). Multiple
robust relationships were identified (Figure 6B). All pairs of
CD4+ and CD8+ correlations qualitatively identified (Figure 3D)
were present among the top 20 strongest correlations (Fig-
ure S7A; Table S5), consistent with the idea that CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells in the TME are exposed to a similar milieu and
tend to follow similar polarization schemes.
We were intrigued to find strong relationships among the ex-
hausted T-0 cluster, the regulatory T-6 cluster, and the M-5

 macrophage cluster. The frequency of T-0 cells was high in sam-
ples with high levels of M-5, and samples with high levels of T-0
and M-5 also contained high amounts of the T-6 CD4+ regulatory
T cells (Figure 6C, left, and S7A). Not all samples containing high
levels of regulatory T cells were enriched for M-5, however. Inter-
estingly, the other two main pro-tumor macrophage phenotypes
M-11 and M-13 displayed a mutually exclusive relationship with
exhausted T cells (Figure 6C, top middle and top right) and did
not show an association with regulatory T cells (Figure 6C,
bottom middle and bottom right). We also observed that M-5,
M-11, and M-13 pro-tumor macrophage populations tended
not to co-occur (Figure 6D).
To explore whether the M-5 phenotype might directly trigger
immunosuppression, we sorted these cells and analyzed their
transcriptomes (Figures S7B and S7C; Table S3). The M-5 pop-
ulation expressed a mixture of pro-inflammatory markers,
including TLR4, STAT1, STAT2, CIITA, and HLA-DP, and anti-in-
flammatory markers such as PPAR-g, C/EBP-b, c-MAF, and
CD200R compared to control (Figure 6E). However, some
canonical markers of pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages
were not induced (Figures 6E and S7D). The M-5 population
also exhibited direct immunosuppressive features including
expression of PDCD1LG2 (CD273) and CD274, which encode li-
gands of PD-1 responsible for T cell exhaustion, and of CXCL10
and CCL8, which encode chemokines known to attract CD8+
T cells and regulatory T cells, respectively (Griffith et al., 2014)
(Figure 6E). Imaging data confirmed that CD38 was co-ex-
pressed on both CD68+ and CD8+ cells and that these cells
could co-localize (Figure 6F). Our imaging panel did not include
enough markers to fully resolve the macrophage and the T cell
phenotypes, but the samples used for imaging were highly en-
riched for the M-5 and T-0 populations (samples 37, 64, and
68; see Figure 5). Thus CD38 expressing CD68+ and CD8+ cells
likely correspond to phenotypes M-5 and T-0, respectively.
Taken together, these data emphasize that M-5 macrophages
display pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor markers and sug-
gest that this population might contribute to the immunosup-
pressed phenotypes of tumors containing high amounts of
M-5 macrophages.
Structure of the Immune Landscape Correlates with
Clinical Outcome
To obtain a global understanding of the relationships between
all immune subsets and clinical parameters, we performed cor-
respondence analysis (CA) (Ha
¨ rdle and Simar, 2003). CA is
similar to principal component analysis but is applied to a fre-
quency table (Table S6). CA reduces high-dimensional observa-
tions to a smaller set of ‘‘explanatory’’ components. In our case,
visualizations based on CA display data on each patient and im-
mune subsets in the same space. Patients are organized by their
tendency to contain certain immune subsets, and immune sub-
sets are organized by their tendency to co-occur in the same
patients.
We found that the first component mainly captures the ten-
dency of the exhausted T cells that express high levels of
PD-1 (T-0) to co-occur with M-5 macrophages (Figures 7A
and 7B). The second component provides a different ordering
of immune subsets and patients, driven by co-occurrence pat-
terns involving M-11 and M-13 clusters. Because the CA
components represent the dominant co-occurrence patterns
observed in these samples, we used these components to
query statistical relationships between TME composition and
clinical variables (Table S1). We found that only the second
component was significantly associated with progression-free
survival (hazard ratio = 7.5; p = 5.5 3 10�3; Table S6; STAR
Methods). Examining the distribution of progression-free sur-
vival times across CA scores, we found that CA-2 assigned
high scores to seven patients (Figure 7C; patient IDs 6, 28, 31,
38, 39, 40, and 53 [Table S1]). Among those patients one died
from acute myeloid leukemia and was removed from subse-
quent statistical analyses. In this scenario, the CA-2 was again
significantly associated with worse clinical outcome (Figure 7D;
log-rank p = 0.013). Analysis of the clinical variables did not
reveal any commonality that might explain the association with
progression-free survival (Table S1).
The most important immune subpopulations for CA-2 are the
pro-tumor macrophage subpopulations M-11, M-13, and M-5
(Figure 7B), in that patients with high CA-2 scores and poor pro-
gression-free survival times had high frequencies of either M-11
or M-13 and low frequencies of M-5 macrophages. In fact, we
found that a score computed as %M-11 + %M-13 – %M-5 pro-
duced a close approximation of the CA-2 score and generated
similar progression-free survival statistics. Thus, the association
between CA-2 and progression-free survival is obtained by
capturing higher order relationships between immune subsets.
These results show that the comprehensive mapping of the im-
mune landscape across 73 patients by mass cytometry not
only identified relationships among immune cell phenotypes in
the TME but also stratified patients in a meaningful way as
reflected in the concordance with clinical outcomes. The latter
association would not have been possible if only individual
markers or cell types had been analyzed.

 DISCUSSION
Immune cells of the TME are part of a complex and intricate
ecosystem. Even after tumors evade immune elimination
(Schreiber et al., 2011), immune cells are able to modulate tumor
progression. With the success of immune checkpoint therapies,
immune cells have become a focus of cancer research and phar-
maceutical development. To improve understanding of the TME,
we performed a mass cytometry analysis of the immune cells
present in normal renal tissue and ccRCC samples. This high-
quality dataset validates prior observations and affords many in-
sights into the immune landscape of the TME.
T cell profiling expanded the view on CD8+/PD-1+ T cell phe-
notypes and found that these cells are characterized by combi-
natorial expressions of inhibitory receptors. Whereas PD-1 had
broad expression, TIM-3, CTLA-4 and 4-1BB were expressed

 only by few PD-1+ clusters; thus, targeting those molecules
might be less effective than targeting PD-1 in ccRCC. Clinical tri-
als should assess whether targeting specific combinations of
inhibitory receptors will enable personalization of therapy and
improve patient outcome. We also identified CD38 as a potential
T cell exhaustion marker in ccRCC. CD38 activates nitric oxide
synthetase, leading to the release of nitric oxide, a mediator of
T cell immunosuppression (Mayo et al., 2008). In HIV patients,
CD38 is co-expressed with PD-1 on exhausted T cells (Hoffmann
et al., 2016). There are differences in exhausted T cells in patients
with chronic infection versus those with cancer (Speiser et al.,
2016), but we propose here that expression of CD38, which
shows the highest overlap with PD-1, is a hallmark of exhausted
T cells in ccRCC.
Based on clustering of data generated with our antibody
panel, we identified 17 major TAM phenotypes. Using a diffusion
map to characterize how TAM clusters are related, we identified
a developmental trajectory that recapitulates the transition be-
tween circulating monocytes and early immigrant and mature
macrophages in the tissue. Although CD163, CD204, and
CD206 have been interchangeably used to define pro-tumori-
genic TAM populations (Komohara et al., 2013; Shigeoka et al.,
2013; Xu et al., 2014), our results suggest that these markers
distinguish subsets. Previous reports suggested that CD169+
macrophages are linked to anti-tumorigenic function due to a
cross-presentation of tumor antigens to CD8+ T cells (Asano
et al., 2011; Martinez-Pomares and Gordon, 2012; Ohnishi
et al., 2013). We observed that in most subsets CD169 was
co-expressed with CD163, CD204, or CD206. This raises the
question of whether CD169 has anti-tumorigenic functions
in ccRCC.
As a first step toward understanding the functional diversity of
these TAM phenotypes, we studied their relationships with other
immune cell populations and to clinical data. We observed a rela-
tionship between the immunosuppressed T cell compartment,
characterized by high levels of PD-1-expressing CD8+ T cells
and a high frequency of regulatory CD4+ T cells, and the M-5
TAM subpopulation. The specificity of this TAM cluster is mostly

 due to the expression of CD38. Depletion or inhibition of CD38
slows progression of glioblastoma in animal models (Blacher
et al., 2015; Levy et al., 2012), and CD38-positive myeloid-
derived suppressor cells suppress T cell activity and promote tu-
mor growth in esophageal cancer models (Karakasheva et al.,
2015). Our results demonstrate that CD38 expression is not
restricted to myeloid-derived suppressor cells but is also present
on TAM subsets. The cluster M-13, which shares most features
with M-5 but does not express CD38, does not show any asso-
ciation with immunosuppression. This suggests that CD38 has
an important role in modulating T cell activity.
The correspondence analysis performed on all immune cell
subsets demonstrated that taking into consideration the fre-
quencies of all immune infiltrates provides a more powerful
way to predict patient outcome than does looking at subsets
individually. We observed that the frequencies of the M-11,
M-13, and M-5 TAM subsets showed a relationship with pro-
gression-free survival. Specifically, patients whose TMEs had
higher frequencies of M-11 and/or M-13 and lower frequencies
of M-5 had shorter progression-free survival.
Our study has limitations. First, mass cytometry relies on high-
quality, informative antibodies. The TAM panel is based on an
antibody screen against human monocyte-derived macro-
phages and might be biased toward these in vitro polarized cells.
Second, we analyzed dissociated ccRCC biopsy samples, and
thus we cannot distinguish immune cell phenotypes specific to
the tumor from those specific to healthy adjacent tissue and ves-
sels. Third, the presented immune cell phenotypes are based on
single-cell measurements coupled to computational analysis.
Our approach recapitulated the known immune landscape, but
follow-up studies to define roles of the phenotypes identified
here are needed. The question of what should ultimately be
defined as a cell type must be resolved. Fourth, cell phenotype
correlations and associations with clinical outcome are based
on a cohort of 73 patients and five matched healthy samples.
Larger and independent cohorts need to be analyzed to yield
statistical power sufficient to identify relationships between clin-
ical outcome and additional immune phenotypes (e.g., previous
work proposed that exhausted T cells correlate with outcome
(Kang et al., 2013)) and to confirm the relationships proposed
in our study. Clinical trials are needed to assess the value of tar-
geting phenotypes described in this study. Fifth, highly multi-
plexed tissue imaging is necessary to determine whether cell
type frequency correlations are reflections of direct cell-cell in-
teractions (Giesen et al., 2014). However, given the influence of
the tissue milieu over space and time on tissue-resident cells,
the influence of one cell type on another cell type does not
necessarily depend on direct cell-cell interactions.
Our fine-grained analysis of the immune cells in the ccRCC
TME revealed well-defined TAM and T cell phenotypes and
showed that distinct subsets are associated with clinical
outcome. Immunotherapy targeting immune checkpoints is
revolutionizing cancer treatment but only for subsets of patients.
The mechanisms of treatment failures are poorly understood,
and monophasic biomarkers such as PD-L1 (CD274) expression
do not identify all responders. The first step in improving immu-
notherapies and supporting the development of novel treat-
ments is to map immune cell infiltrate of tumors and to study
the relationships among these cells. The immune cell atlas re-
ported here will provide a valuable resource to accelerate
research in this direction.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Buffy coats from healthy donors were obtained from the Zurich Blood Transfusion Service. Primary ccRCC tissue samples were ob-
tained from the University Health Network (UHN) Biospecimen Sciences Program and from the Cooperative Health Tissue Network
(CHTN) from patients providing written consent under UHN Research Ethics Board approval, protocol #09-0828-T. Tumor grades
were histologically determined by a pathologist and are reported in Table S1. 78 samples grouped as normal kidney (n = 5),
grade I (n = 5), grade II (n = 34), grade III (n = 22), grade IV (n = 8) and metastasis (n = 4) were used in this study. Further clinical
data were available only for the 47 tumor samples collected via the UHN, since additional clinical information associated to the
CHTN samples could not be retrieved. 15 tumors were collected from women and 32 from men. 14 samples were from patients under
60, 16 from patients between 60 and 70 and 17 from patients above 70.
METHOD DETAILS
MDM Culture
Monocytes were isolated by histopaque (Sigma Aldrich) density gradient centrifugation followed by a MACS purification using the
pan monocyte isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Monocytes were differentiated into immature

 macrophages by culture for 5 days in 75-cm2 tissue culture dishes in presence of 30 ng/ml M-CSF (PeproTech). Cells were subse-
quently polarized for 24 hr as indicated in Table S2. For mass cytometry analysis, cells were stained for viability with 10 mM cisplatin
(Enzo Life Sciences) in a 1 min pulse before quenching with 10% FBS as previously described (Fienberg et al., 2012). Cells were then
fixed with 1.6% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 10 min at room temperature and stored at �80�C.
Fluorescence Cell Barcoding and Antibody Screening
Fixed MDM populations were barcoded with 0, 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/ml Alexa Fluor 700 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester (Molecular
Probes) and 0, 0.1, or 10 mg/ml of Alexa Fluor 750 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes) as previously described
(Krutzik and Nolan, 2006). The combined samples were screened with the BioLegend human cell screening kit containing 342
pre-titrated PE-conjugated antibodies arrayed on four 96-well plates according to manufacturer’s instructions. Immediately after
staining, data were acquired on a Canto II (BD Biosciences) using the auto sampler. We identified 87 differentially expressed markers
(Figure S1B), and a subset of these was selected for the TAM panel (Figure 1C).
Tumor and Standard Sample Preparation
Tumor samples were digested to generate single-cell suspensions as previously described (Gedye and Ailles, 2013). Cells were then
viably frozen in 10% DMSO in D-SDCM complemented with 10% FBS. Cryopreserved cells were resuscitated for mass cytometry
analyses by rapid thawing and slow dilution. Cells were stained for viability, fixed, and stored as indicated for MDMs. A standard was
generated by mixing PBMCs with three populations of monocytes obtained after activation with LPS, with LPS and immune complex,
and with IL-10 in a 3:1:1:1 ratio.
Gadolinium Contamination Test
Some patients were scanned during diagnosis with magnetic resonance imaging using a gadolinium-containing contrast agent. To
identify samples positive for gadolinium, a small aliquot of each sample was collected after fixation and analyzed individually in the
mass cytometer.
Mass Cytometry Barcoding
To ensure homogeneous staining, 0.3 3 106 to 0.8 3 106 cells from each tumor sample were barcoded using a 20-well barcoding
scheme consisting of unique combinations of three out of six barcoding reagents as previously described (Zunder et al., 2015).
Four palladium isotopes (104Pd, 106Pd, 108Pd, and 110Pd, Fluidigm) were conjugated to bromoacetamidobenzyl-EDTA (BABE) and
two indium isotopes (113In and 115In, Fluidigm) were conjugated to 1,4,7,10-tetraazacy-clododecane-1,4,7-tris-acetic acid 10-
maleimide ethylacetamide (mDOTA) following standard procedures (Zivanovic et al., 2013). Mass tag barcoding reagents were
titrated to ensure an equivalent staining for each reagent, and the final concentrations were between 50 nM and 200 nM. Cells
were barcoded using the transient partial permeabilization protocol (Behbehani et al., 2014). The samples were grouped as gadolin-
ium-positive and gadolinium-negative, and samples were randomly loaded in five 96-well plates. One standard sample was loaded in
one well of each plate. Cells were washed with 0.03% saponin in PBS (Sigma Aldrich) and incubated for 30 min with 200 mL of mass
tag barcoding reagents. Cells were washed twice with PBS-S and twice with cell staining medium (CSM, PBS with 0.5% bovine
serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide). At this point, samples from each plate were pooled and split into two tubes for subsequent
cell staining with the two antibody panels.
Antibodies and Antibody Labeling
Provider, clone, and metal tag of each antibody used in this study are listed in Table S2. Antibody labeling with the indicated metal tag
was performed using the MaxPAR antibody conjugation kit (Fluidigm). The concentration of each antibody was assessed after metal
conjugation using a Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific). The concentration was adjusted to 200 mg/ml in Candor Antibody Stabilizer. Con-
jugated antibodies were titrated for optimal concentration for use. All antibodies used in this study were managed using the cloud-
based platform AirLab (Catena et al., 2016).
Antibody Staining
After barcoding, pooled cells were incubated with FcR blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotech) for 10 min at 4�C. Samples were stained
with 300 ml of the antibody panel per 107 cells for 20 min at 4�C. Cells were washed twice in CSM and resuspended in 1 mL of nucleic
acid Ir-Intercalator (Fluidigm) for 1 hr at room temperature. Cells were then washed once in CSM, once in PBS, and twice in water.
Cells were then diluted to 0.5 3 106 cells/ml in H2O containing 10% of EQ Four Element Calibration Beads (Fluidigm). Samples were
acquired on a CyTOF 2 mass cytometer (TAM panel) and a Helios upgraded CyTOF 2 (T cell panel). Individual .fcs files collected from
each set of samples were concatenated using the .fcs concatenation tool from Cytobank, and data were normalized using the
executable MATLAB version of the Normalizer tool (Finck et al., 2013). Individual samples were debarcoded using the executable
MATLAB version of the single-cell debarcoder tool (Zunder et al., 2015).

 Cell Sorting, RNA Extraction and Deep Sequencing
M-5, control macrophages, PD-1- and CD8+/PD-1+ cells were isolated from tumor samples enriched for those subsets (Table S3).
Viably frozen samples were resuscitated as previously described, incubated with the Zombie NIR dye (Biolegend) for dead cell exclu-
sion for 15 min at room temperature, blocked with FcR blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotech) for 10 min at 4�C, and stained for 30 min at
4�C with the antibodies indicated in Table S3. As shown in Figures S4C and S7B, cell subsets were sorted as CD14+/HLA-DR+/
CD204-/CD38-/CD206- (Control) and CD14+/HLA-DR+/CD204+/CD38+/CD206- (M-5), CD3+/CD8+/PD-1- (CD8+/PD-1- T cells) and
CD3+/CD8+/PD-1+ (CD8+/ PD-1+ T cells) using a 100-mm nozzle on a FACS Aria III 5L Cell sorter. Cells were harvested in RPMI-
FBS (10%) medium and immediately used for RNA purification using the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFischer) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was resuspended in 15 mL of elution buffer, quality-checked on the Bioanalyzer instrument (Agilent
Technologies) using the RNA 6000 Pico Chip (Agilent Technologies), and quantified by fluorometry using Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA
Assay Kit (Life Technologies). Of each sample, 4 ng RNA was used to generate the sequencing libraries using the SMARTer Stranded
Total RNA-Seq Kit - Pico Input Mammalian (Takara Bio) and Nextera XT (Illumina) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries
were quality-checked on the Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical) using the High Sensitivity NGS Fragment Analysis Kit
(Advanced Analytical). Libraries were pooled and sequenced SR75 on a NextSeq 500 system (Illumina) using the High Output Kit
v2 (75 cycles) following the manufacturer’s protocols.
Multiplexed Imaging
Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded sections from M-5 positive and control ccRCC samples were stained using the Opal 7-Color
Fluorescent IHC Kit (PerkinElmer) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated and antigen
retrieved using Trilogy buffer (CellMarque) by autoclaving for 15 min. Slides were treated with 3% H2O2 for 15 min, washed, and
blocked using 4% BSA/PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 (all from Sigma). Primary antibodies and consecutive HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Table S7) were diluted in 1% BSA/PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Slides were
then incubated in Amplification diluent containing a tyramide-conjugated fluorophore for 10 min. Prior to the second primary antibody
incubation, the slides were heated for 10 min in 10 mM citric acid, pH 6.0 at 95�C to strip the antibodies of the first staining round. The
protocol was repeated from the blocking step 3 to 4 times to co-stain several markers.

with up to 20 hits in the genome, reporting a single randomly selected hit per read, resulting in average mapping rates of 70% and
95% for uniquely and total mapped reads, respectively, corresponding to an average of 30.5 Mio. aligned reads per sample (ranging
from 22.7 Mio. to 40.9 Mio.). Ribosomal RNA contamination was estimated using fastq-screen version 0.9.5 http://www.
bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastq_screen/ using a collection of mammalian ribosomal RNA sequences downloaded
from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and was found to be on average about 4% (ranging from 0.5% to
8.1%). Counts representing gene expression levels were obtained using the qCount function from the QuasR Bioconductor
package (Gaidatzis et al., 2015) with parameters reportLevel = ’’gene,’’ orientation = ’’same’’ and gene annotation from the
TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene package, which counts all reads that overlap with any exon from a gene on the sense
strand. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the edgeR bioconductor package (Robinson et al., 2010), specifically
the quasi-likelihood generalized linear model framework (Lun et al., 2016)
To control for possible patient effects that would similarly affect all cell populations isolated from the same patient donor and
confound the comparison of cell populations across patients, we fit the data using glmQLFit and a model of the form �0 + cell.
population + patient. In this model, the resulting coefficient cell.population represents average gene expression of each cell popu-
lation, whereas patient-specific effects are absorbed by the patient coefficient. For visualization, normalized gene expression levels
were calculated as read per kilobase and million as: rpkmg,i = ng,i /Ni *106 /lg *103, where ng,i is the read count for gene g in sample i, Ni
the total number of read counts for all genes in sample i, and lg is the number of exonic bases in gene g.
Mass Cytometry Data Analysis
Files (.fcs) were uploaded into Cytobank, populations of interest were manually gated, and events of interest were exported as .fcs
files. For visualization of biaxial marker expression we used FlowJo. For downstream analysis, .fcs files were loaded into R
(R Development Core Team, 2015). Signal intensities for each channel were arcsinh transformed with a cofactor of 5 (x_transf =
asinh(x/5)). To visualize the high-dimensional data in two dimensions, the t-SNE algorithm was applied on data from 2,000 randomly
selected cells from each sample. The total cell population was used when less than 2,000 cells were available. The R t-SNE package
for Barnes-Hut implementation of t-SNE was used. Data were displayed using the ggplot2 R package (Wickham, 2009).

 To visualize marker expression analyses on t-SNE maps, the top percentile was excluded, and the maximum intensity was defined
as the 99th percentile. The data from all samples were divided by this value leading to signal intensities ranging between 0 and 1 for
each channel. For hierarchical clustering, pairwise distances between samples were calculated using the Spearman correlation.
Dendrograms were generated using Ward’s method. Heatmaps were displayed in R using the heatmap.2 function from the ggplot
package. Clustering analysis was performed using the Python implementation of PhenoGraph run on all samples simultaneously.
To identify the main cell subsets in the datasets generated with TAM and T cell panels, PhenoGraph was run with the parameter
k, defining the number of nearest neighbors, set to 100 (Levine et al., 2015). Sample #61 was excluded as an outlier for the myeloid
compartment and samples #25 and #17 were excluded due to insufficient immune cell number.
To specifically define the T cell clusters, PhenoGraph was run on the T cell subsets defined in the first PhenoGraph analysis after
principal component analysis preprocessing on the components accounting for 99% of the variance. CD86, CD20, CD206, CD68,
and CD15 were excluded from the analysis to remove markers not expressed on T cells and likely to add noise in the cluster gen-
eration process. CD7 was also excluded from the PhenoGraph clustering since this marker split most clusters into CD7+ and
CD7- fractions without a clear biological meaning and simultaneously reduced the impact of more biologically relevant markers
on the clustering. The parameter k to define the nearest neighbors was set to 100. Because TAM subsets were less well-character-
ized than T cell subsets and because they tend to form less discrete structures in phenotypic space, we deployed a subsampling
procedure in order to identify robust TAM clusters. PhenoGraph was run on 500 random subsamples of the myeloid cells identified
by the initial application of the algorithm (Figure 2C). Each subsample retained 90% of the original cells and the value of the parameter
k was also set to a random value between 40 and 80 for each subsample. The purpose of this procedure was to identify substructures
that occur consistently despite perturbations to the underlying data and parameter k. In order to obtain a consensus solution based
on these subsamples, each intermediate result was compared using an overlap score, which quantifies how well each result repre-
sents the others. For two partitions A and B, the score is defined as:
S =
X
i;j
ðoi;j � ei;jÞ
Zi;j
where i and j index clusters in A and B and the following quantities are defined:
oi;j =

ei;j
and N is the total number of cells. Note that S = 0 for random A and B and S = 1 when A = B. The intermediate solution with the highest
mean score was taken as the best consensus solution. Because this solution contained cluster assignments for 90% of cells, the
remaining 10% of cells were assigned to clusters using the PhenoGraph classification procedure as previously described (Levine
et al., 2015).
To assess single-cell trajectories among TAMs, we used the R implementation of the diffusion map algorithm destiny (Angerer
et al., 2016). A maximum of 2,000 cells randomly selected from each cluster were included in the analysis. Diffusion distances
were calculated based on arcsinh transformed data (cofactor of 5). The width sigma of the Gaussian kernel was defined using the
heuristic estimation provided in the destiny implementation, the k nearest neighbor was set to 100, and Euclidean distance was
used as a metric.
In order to rank the correlations between immune cell type frequencies across patients while ignoring inflated correlations driven by
individual patients, we report the Pearson correlation coefficient and associated p value corresponding to the worst performing sub-
set of all leave-one-out patient subsets. The correlation was computed for each pair of immune cell types on 73 subsets of samples,
each subset lacking one of each of the 73 samples included in the analysis. The correlation for each cell type pair was then defined as
the result among subsets for which the p value was largest.
Correspondence analysis was performed on a frequency table in which each row represents a patient and each column represents
the frequency of an immune cell type in that patient (Table S6). Calculation of the projections, variance explained, and absolute con-
tributions was performed exactly as described (Ha
¨ rdle and Simar, 2003).
Progression-free survival was defined as the number of days from diagnosis until the first of locoregional recurrence, distant recur-
rence, or death if any of these occurred. Survival analysis was conducted in R and in Python using the ‘survival’ and ‘lifelines’ libraries,
for Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis, respectively (Davidson-Pilon, 2016). The association between
CA score and progression-free survival was assessed in several contexts. First, each of the first 25 component scores—accounting
Cell 169, 736–749.e1–e7, May 4, 2017

 collectively for 98% of the variance in the co-association structure of the data—was tested in a univariate context (with age and
gender included as possible confounding variables); only CA-2 was significant in this setting (p = 0.006). Next, we considered multi-
variate models including up to six CA components; CA-2 was the only component associated with progression-free survival in any
context (Table S6). The same statistical analyses were repeated after exclusion of patient ID #53 who died from acute myeloid leu-
kemia. The association between CA-2 and progression-free survival was the only significant relationship in any univariate context
(with age and gender included as possible confounding variables) and in a multivariate context until and including CA-3 (Table
S6). The dataset was under-powered to include stage and grade in the regression models, but an in-depth assessment of the seven
patients highlighted for Kaplan-Meier analysis did not reveal a common covariate—such as stage or grade—that might explain the
association with progression-free survival.

 Figure S7. FACS Isolation of Macrophage Subsets and Deep-Sequencing Results, Related to Figure 6
(A) Scatterplots showing the relationships between pairs of phenotypically similar CD4+ and CD8+ subsets (see Figure 3D). For each relationship, the Pearson
correlation score and the p value are indicated. The linear model describing the relationship is depicted as a blue line.
(B) Contour plots showing the gating strategy used to sort CD14+/HLA-DR+/CD204�/CD38�/CD206� (Control) and CD14+/HLA-DR+/CD204+/CD38+/CD206�
(M-5) macrophage populations.
(C) Boxplots comparing the expression levels of the 30 macrophage-specific markers present in the TAM panel as assessed by mass cytometry (Protein) and by
deep sequencing (mRNA). The surface phenotypes of the manually gated M-5 population (CD68+/HLA-DR+/CD204+/CD38+/CD206�) and the PhenoGraph
identified M-5 cluster in the 6 populations used for deep sequencing were compared (M-5 gated versus M-5 PG cluster) highlighting the consistency of the
different analysis modalities.
(D) Boxplots showing the expression level of the indicated genes in control (n = 11) and M-5 (n = 6) macrophage populations as assessed by deep sequencing.
The p values calculated using a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test are shown.
(E) Another antibody clone against CD274 provides a higher dynamic range and recapitulates the expression difference observed in (C). Top: Contour plot
showing the gating strategy to identify CD68+/CD204+/CD38+ macrophage and CD68+/CD204�/CD38� control cells. Middle: Histogram overlay showing the
expression of CD274 in control versus M-5 macrophage populations. Bottom: Boxplot showing the median intensity of CD274 on control cells (n = 6) and M-5
(n = 6) macrophage populations.
