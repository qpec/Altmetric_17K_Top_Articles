OBJECTIVES: In this study we aimed to identify novel
metabolomic biomarkers suitable for improved diagnosis
of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
METHODS: We prospectively recruited 887 individuals
consisting of HFrEF patients with either ischemic
(ICMP, n � 257) or nonischemic cardiomyopathy
(NICMP, n � 269), healthy controls (n � 327), and
patients with pulmonary diseases (n � 34). A single-
center identification (n � 238) was followed by a multi-
center confirmation study (n � 649). Plasma samples
from the single-center study were subjected to metabolite
profiling analysis to identify metabolomic features with
potential as HFrEF biomarkers. A dedicated analytical
protocol was developed for the routine analysis of se-
lected metabolic features in the multicenter cohort.
RESULTS: In the single-center study, 92 of 181 metabo-
lomic features with known chemical identity (51%) were
significantly changed in HFrEF patients compared to
healthy controls (P �0.05). Three specific metabolomic
features belonging to the lipid classes of sphingomyelins,
triglycerides, and phosphatidylcholines were selected as
the cardiac lipid panel (CLP) and analyzed in the multi-
center study using the dedicated analytical protocol. The
combination of the CLP with N-terminal pro–B-type
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) distinguished HFrEF
patients from healthy controls with an area under the
curve (AUC) of 0.97 (sensitivity 80.2%, specificity
97.6%) and was significantly superior compared to NT-
proBNP alone (AUC � 0.93, sensitivity 81.7%, speci-
ficity 88.1%, P �0.001), even in the subgroups with
mildly reduced left ventricular EF (0.94 vs 0.87;
P �0.001) and asymptomatic patients (0.95 vs 0.91;
P �0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The new metabolomic biomarker panel
has the potential to improve HFrEF detection, even in
mild and asymptomatic stages. The observed changes
further indicate lipid alterations in the setting of HFrEF.

Heart failure (HF)10 is a complex clinical syndrome that
represents the common endpoint of many diverse cardio-
vascular disorders (1). Owing to its high prevalence,
chronic morbidity, and high mortality rate, HF imposes
a major burden on healthcare systems (2, 3). Thus, ac-
curate and early detection is of paramount importance to
initiate proper treatment strategies. At present, diagnosis
of HF predominantly relies on clinical findings, imaging
modalities, and biomarkers such as N-terminal pro–B-
type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (1). Despite wide
acceptance for the rule-out of HF, the clinical utility of
natriuretic peptides for rule-in is limited by their lack of
specificity (4, 5). In addition, natriuretic peptides have a
considerable diagnostic grey zone, which limits their util-
ity for the detection of early and asymptomatic stages of
the disease (4, 5). More recently, multimarker ap-
proaches have been proposed to overcome these limita-
tions (6). In addition, advances in high-throughput pro-
filing technologies have enabled omics-based analyses of
DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites (7). Metabolites

 as the end product of changes in gene expression and
protein function may reflect not only the underlying car-
diac disease but also the complex adaptive response of the
entire body (8, 9). Metabolite profiling has emerged as a
promising tool to identify novel diagnostic and therapeu-
tic markers specific for cardiovascular diseases (10, 11).
In addition, combination of several metabolomic fea-
tures into a biomarker panel may provide a better char-
acterization of HF than single biomarkers. To this end,
we sought to identify novel biomarker panels combining
NT-proBNP with metabolomic features, which in com-
parison to NT-proBNP alone improve detection of HF
patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) due to
ischemic (ICMP) or nonischemic cardiomyopathy
(NICMP).
Materials and Methods
PATIENTS AND CONTROLS
In an initial single-center study, we enrolled 155 HFrEF
patients in ambulatory care, comprising 76 patients with
ICMP and 79 with NICMP in New York Heart Associ-
ation (NYHA) functional classes I (n � 74) and II–III
(n � 81), and compared these patients to 83 healthy
volunteer controls of healthy. All patients and controls
were recruited from the Department of Cardiology, Uni-
versity Hospital of Heidelberg, Germany. In the subse-
quent multicenter study, 3 independent patient cohorts
were recruited from 3 clinical centers (Heidelberg, Ber-
lin, and Kiel). This cohort comprised 244 healthy volun-
teer controls and 371 HFrEF patients in ambulatory care,
including 181 patients with ICMP and 190 with NICMP
in NYHA classes I (n � 139) and II–III (n � 232). In
addition, a cohort of 34 patients with pulmonary diseases
was recruited. Patients were characterized based on echocar-
diographic and/or cardiac catheterization findings, includ-
ing
hemodynamic
measurements.
Investigators
were
blinded to biomarker results. Detailed inclusion and
exclusion criteria are listed in the Data Supplement that
accompanies the online version of this article at
http://www.clinchem.org/content/vol63/issue1).
The ethics committees of all participating centers
approved the study protocol, which was performed ac-
cording to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki,
and informed consent was signed by all participants.
IMAGING TECHNIQUES
Coronary angiography was performed in 254 (98.8%)
ICMP and 260 (96.7%) NICMP patients. In addition,
33 (12.8%) ICMP and 85 (31.6%) NICMP patients
underwent cardiac MRI (cMRI) including dobutamine
stress testing. Echocardiography was performed in 516
HFrEF patients (98.1%) and left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF) was determined by the biplane disc sum-
mation method (Simpson rule). In patients without
echocardiography, LVEF was determined by cMRI. Left
ventricular systolic function was classified as severely re-
duced if LVEF was �35% and mildly reduced if LVEF
was between 35% and 50%.
To exclude important structural or coronary heart
disease in the control group, 168 individuals (51.4%)
underwent Gadolinium contrast–enhanced cMRI with
dobutamine stress testing, and 159 individuals (48.6%)
underwent 2D echocardiography at rest and under
exercise.
BLOOD SAMPLING
Blood was collected from all patients and controls follow-
ing 5 min of rest in supine position. Participants were
fasted for at least 8 h to minimize the influence of nutri-
tion on metabolite levels. Blood was collected in EDTA
Monovette® tubes (Sarstedt), which were gently inverted
5 times to allow mixing. Samples were stored for a max-
imum of 1 h at 4 °C before centrifugation at 1000g for 10
min. Plasma was immediately transferred to a prelabeled
1-mL microtube (Sarsted) and stored at �80 °C until
shipment to metanomics GmbH on dry ice.
LABORATORY ANALYSIS AND METABOLITE PROFILING
Plasma concentrations of NT-proBNP were deter-
mined in a central laboratory with the Elecsys proBNP
II assay (Roche Diagnostics) on a Modular E170 ana-
lyzer. Functional sensitivity has been found to be 50
pg/mL and intermediate precision (CV) was 2.7% at
125 pg/mL (12). Metabolite profiling of human
plasma samples was performed at metanomics GmbH
using both GC-MS (Agilent 6890 GC coupled to an
Agilent 5973 MS-System) and LC-MS/MS systems
(Agilent 1100 HPLC-System coupled to an Applied
Biosystems API4000 MS/MS-System) as previously
described (13). In addition, a dedicated analytical pro-
tocol was developed for the routine determination of
specific metabolomic features. The protocol is based
on a 1-phase extraction of the samples followed by
LC-MS/MS analysis. Details can be found in the on-
line Data Supplement (see text and Supplemental Ta-
bles 1, A and B). Data on within-run and between-
run imprecision, accuracy, and linearity of the cardiac
lipid panel assay metabolites are provided in online
Supplemental Table 1, C–E, and Supplemental
Fig. 1.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Distributions of the clinical characteristics were analyzed
by Shapiro–Wilk test. Parameters following a normal dis-
tribution were compared by Student t-test, and parame-
ters deviating from normal distribution were analyzed by
the Kruskal–Wallis test using SPSS 16.0.
All metabolite profiling data were log10-transformed
before further analysis to achieve an approximate normal

 distribution. Principal component analysis (PCA) was
performed using SIMCA P� software (Version 13;
Umetrics). For PCA, the log10-transformed data were
centered and scaled to unit variance before the analysis.
Univariate statistics of the log10-transformed data were
calculated by ANOVA with a linear model using R soft-
ware (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing), cor-
recting for the confounding factors clinical center (only
applicable for the multicenter study), sex, age, and body
mass index (BMI).
Prediction probabilities for each patient were calcu-
lated with a logistic regression model fitted using the
elastic net algorithm as implemented in the R package
glmnet (14, 15). The fitting was performed on the log10-
transformed, centered, and scaled data from a randomly
selected training subset of the multicenter study. The L1
and the L2 penalties were given equal weight. A formula
for the calculation of prediction probabilities including
feature-specific scaling factors and coefficients can be
found in the online Data Supplement (see text and Sup-
plemental Table 2).
Diagnostic performance was determined from ROC
curves comparing HFrEF patients and healthy controls.
Approximated ROC curves were calculated on the basis
of a binormal model to compare the area under the curve
(AUC) (16). For comparison of statistical models the
Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian in-
formation criterion (BIC) were used. To achieve binor-
mality, the prediction probabilities were transformed us-
ing the logit function, whereas NT-proBNP values were
log-transformed. Significance of changes in sensitivity/
specificity was assessed using the McNemar test as imple-
mented in R.

IDENTIFICATION OF METABOLOMIC FEATURES WITH
POTENTIAL AS HFrEF BIOMARKERS
With use of the MxP® Broad Profiling platform, 199
metabolomic features, 181 of which had known chemical
identity, were analyzed in human plasma samples from
an initial single-center study (n � 238). Online Supple-
mental Table 3 lists 92 metabolomic features with known
chemical identity that were significantly changed (P
�0.05) in HFrEF patients relative to healthy controls.
Sixty-nine of these were significantly changed in both
ICMP and NICMP patients. Lipids and amino acids
were the most highly represented ontology classes
(Table 2).

Clinical Chemistry 63:1 (2017)
 In a PCA of the metabolomic data from the single-
center study, HFrEF patients (both ICMP and NICMP)
tended to have lower scores on the second principal com-
ponent than healthy controls (Fig. 1A) and lipids covered
the broadest range of loadings on this component (Fig.
1B). Lipids were therefore selected as focus for the devel-
opment of an analytical protocol suitable for application
in the clinical routine.
A CARDIAC LIPID PANEL COMBINED WITH NT-proBNP
A simple, dedicated analytical protocol enabling the anal-
ysis of 4 specific metabolomic features belonging to the
lipid classes of sphingomyelins (SMs), triglycerides
(TAGs), phosphatidylcholines (PCs), and cholesterylest-
ers (CEs) was developed and applied to the multicenter
study. The metabolomic features comprised in this ana-
lytical protocol were significantly changed in both ICMP
and NICMP patients relative to healthy controls (Table
3). Three of these 4 metabolomic features (TAG 18:1/
18:0/18:0, PC 16:0/18:2, and the sum of the 3 isobaric
SM species SM d18:1/23:1, SM d18:2/23:0, and SM
d17:1/24:1) were selected as the cardiac lipid panel
(CLP). A logistic regression model combining these 3
metabolomic features with NT-proBNP (CLP � NT)
was applied for the discrimination between HFrEF pa-
tients and healthy controls. The formula was fitted on a
randomly selected subset of the multicenter study (n �
400; referred to as the training set), and the performance
was tested on the remaining individuals from the multi-
center study (n � 215; referred to as the testing set;
Table 4).
DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF CLP + NT TO DIFFERENTIATE
HFrEF FROM HEALTHY CONTROLS
ROC curves showed a significantly improved diagnostic
performance of CLP � NT compared to NT-proBNP
alone in HFrEF patients (AUC 0.97 vs 0.93; P �0.001),
but also in the subgroups with mildly reduced LVEF
(35% � LVEF � 50%, AUC 0.94 vs 0.87, P �0.001) as
well as in asymptomatic patients (AUC 0.95 vs 0.91,
P �0.05) (Table 4; Fig. 2A). A cutoff value of 0.738 was
chosen for the prediction probability to achieve compa-
rable sensitivity for the detection of HFrEF as with NT-
proBNP alone (cutoff 125 pg/mL) (Fig. 2B). At this cut-
off value, the specificity was increased from 88.1% to
97.6% compared to NT-proBNP alone (Table 4). A
comparable diagnostic performance was achieved using
an alternative biomarker panel obtained by replacing PC
16:0/18:2 with CE 18:2 (data not shown). CLP � NT
showed a higher diagnostic performance than both a
baseline model using the factors age, BMI, and sex as well
as the combination of NT-proBNP with the baseline
model (see online Supplemental Table 4). In addition,
the models containing CLP had the lowest AIC and BIC
values indicating a better fit of the models compared to
other tested models.
Healthy controls who were correctly classified using
CLP � NT but misclassified as HFrEF using NT-
proBNP alone (n � 30), thus increasing test specificity,
were significantly older, had lower BMIs, and were more
likely female, as compared to the remaining healthy con-
trols (see online Supplemental Table 5A). HFrEF pa-
tients correctly classified with CLP � NT but misclassi-
fied using NT-proBNP alone, thus increasing test
sensitivity, were significantly younger, had higher BMIs,
had lower higher LVEF as well as a trend toward male
gender, compared to the remaining HFrEF patients (see
online Supplemental Table 5B).
An analysis of the influence of HF medication on the
diagnostic performance of CLP � NT and NT-proBNP
alone can be found in the online Data Supplement (see
Supplemental Table 6 and Supplemental Fig. 2).

 DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF CLP + NT TO DIFFERENTIATE
HFrEF FROM PATIENTS WITH PULMONARY DISEASES
The performance of CLP � NT was subsequently tested
to differentiate HFrEF patients of the testing set (n �
131) from patients with pulmonary origin of dyspnea
and absence of systolic and diastolic LV dysfunction (n �
34) (see online Supplemental Table 7). When applying
the same cutoff values as for healthy controls, specificity
increased from 74% to 88% owing to improved detec-
tion of 5 of 34 patients with pulmonary diseases (see
online Supplemental Fig. 3). However, further analysis
of the diagnostic performance was limited by the small
number of patients.
Discussion
In this study, we identified 92 metabolomic features that
were significantly changed in HFrEF patients vs healthy
controls and thus were regarded as potential biomarkers
for the detection of HFrEF. This initial single-center
study was followed by a large multicenter study and the
development of a dedicated analytical protocol designed
to be suitable for routine clinical application. Building on
the current reference standard for HF diagnosis, NT-
proBNP, a combination of NT-proBNP with as few as 3
metabolomic features (CLP � NT), significantly im-
proved the diagnostic performance for HF detection over

 NT-proBNP alone, even in patients with mildly reduced
LVEF and asymptomatic stages of the disease. The
metabolomic features contained in CLP belong to the
lipid classes of TAGs, SMs, and PCs.
METABOLOMIC FEATURES AS NOVEL DIAGNOSTIC
BIOMARKERS FOR HFrEF
Previous studies identified several metabolomic features
in plasma and tissue samples that were related to HF or
cardiovascular pathologies such as coronary artery disease
(CAD) (11, 17, 18). Recently, Cheng et al. identified
biomarker panels comprising metabolomic features from
several ontology classes in a large metabolomics study on
HF patients (19). One panel achieved similar diagnostic
performance as BNP for distinguishing HF stage C pa-
tients from healthy controls, while another panel was
superior to BNP regarding 1-year prognosis. In contrast
with our study, Cheng et al. did not report on the diag-
nostic performance of their panel in patients with early
HF stages. Moreover, the present study aims at improv-
ing the diagnostic performance of NT-proBNP by com-
bining it with three specific metabolomic features be-
longing to the lipid classes of TAGs, SMs, and PCs rather
than replacing natriuretic peptides. The resulting bio-
marker panel, CLP � NT, distinguished HFrEF patients
from healthy controls as well as from patients with dys-
pnea of pulmonary origin, and thus provides several ad-
vantages over NT-proBNP alone that have the potential
to translate into clinical benefits:
First, application of NT-proBNP as a single bio-
marker for large-scale screening is limited primarily by
insufficient specificity, resulting in a high false positive
rate or low positive predictive value (4, 5, 20, 21). At the
chosen cutoff value, CLP � NT shows strongly increased
specificity compared to NT-proBNP alone at compara-
ble sensitivity. A low false-positive rate is particularly im-
portant in the outpatient setting and may prevent pa-
tients
from
unnecessary
diagnostic
workup
and
treatment, which in turn will save resources and avoid
potential side-effects (20). Second, a more accurate diag-
nosis of patients with early and intermediate stages such
as left ventricular remodeling and mild or asymptomatic
systolic dysfunction as observed with the novel panel
compared to NT-proBNP alone may accelerate adequate
pharmacological or behavioral treatments for the reduc-
tion of mortality and morbidity in these patients (7, 20).
Third, we observed older age and lower BMI in healthy
controls correctly classified using CLP � NT but mis-
classified with NT-proBNP alone, as well as younger age
and higher BMI in HFrEF patients correctly classified as
positive with CLP � NT, but negative with NT-proBNP
alone. The diagnostic performance of CLP � NT was
thus increased in comparison to NT-proBNP alone es-
pecially due to a better classification of these patients,
which is in line with previous observations showing that
the sensitivity of NT-proBNP is influenced by age and
BMI (5). Fourth, initial results of the differentiation of
HFrEF patients from patients with pulmonary diseases
highlight the potential of CLP � NT to improve HFrEF
detection also in patient cohorts with similar clinical
characteristics such as dyspnea or traditional cardiovas-
cular risk factors but other underlying disease.
Finally, apart from the diagnostic advantages of
measuring biomarkers covering different aspects of the
disease and improving discrimination of early stages,
multimarker strategies may also have the potential for
analysis of medication targets and personalized medicine
in future studies to help physicians in optimizing indi-
vidual treatments (7, 22, 23).
COMPOSITION OF THE NOVEL BIOMARKER PANEL
The metabolomic features used as biomarkers in the pres-
ent study belong to the lipid classes of TAGs, SMs, PCs,
and, alternatively, CEs. The finding that a combination
of NT-proBNP with these metabolomic features is able
to reliably discriminate between HFrEF patients and
healthy controls may indicate a differential regulation of
lipid metabolism in healthy individuals and HFrEF pa-
tients. The observed metabolomic changes may reflect
alterations in lipid homeostasis in the heart itself, or,
alternatively, may reflect secondary changes in end or-
gans caused by impaired cardiac function. The increase in

 diagnostic performance achieved with CLP � NT in
comparison to NT-proBNP alone may thus result from a
more comprehensive representation of the entire cardiac
and extracardiac phenotype.
Recently, population-based studies showed associa-
tion of certain specific plasma or serum lipids—for exam-
ple, specific TAG and CE species—with cardiovascular
disease risk (24, 25). In addition, myocardial accumula-
tion of diacylglycerol, sphingolipids, and ceramides was
previously observed in an animal model for LV systolic
dysfunction (26). In our study, the SM species contained
in CLP as well as the linoleic acid–containing lipids CE
18:2 and PC 16:0/18:2 were significantly decreased
rather than increased in HFrEF patients relative to
healthy controls, suggesting that they represent different
aspects of the underlying disease than the changes previ-
ously reported (24, 25). The strong correlation between
molecular species of CE and PC sharing linoleic fatty acid
can be explained by a direct biochemical connection be-
tween these lipid classes through the enzyme lecithin:
cholesterol acyltransferase.
In conclusion, a combination of NT-proBNP with
specific metabolomic features belonging to the lipid
classes of TAGs, SMs, and PCs demonstrates an excellent
diagnostic performance, significantly improving the di-
agnosis of HFrEF even in patients with mildly reduced
LVEF and in asymptomatic stages of the disease. The
metabolites in CLP � NT can be measured using a ded-
icated analytical protocol designed to be suitable for clin-
ical practice. Moreover, the combination of these
metabolomic features with NT-proBNP overcomes well-
known limitations of NT-proBNP concerning age, gen-
der, and BMI.
LIMITATIONS
The study design was based on the comparison between
HFrEF patients and healthy controls, in which comor-
bidities commonly associated with HF, such as arterial
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, etc.,
were excluded. Thus, we cannot rule out that diagnostic
performance may be biased owing to clinical baseline
differences between HFrEF patients and healthy controls
similar to other large studies on biomarker discovery us-
ing metabolite profiling (19, 27). Although results from
the patients with pulmonary diseases and associated car-
diovascular risk factors showed a reduction of false-
positive biomarker findings with CLP � NT compared
to NT-proBNP alone, additional clinical studies will be
necessary to further validate the clinical value of this
novel diagnostic approach in HF cohorts. These should
include population-based studies to address HFrEF de-
tection in mildly symptomatic individuals or high-risk
cohorts such as patients with traditional risk factors,
which are currently in progress. In addition, the possibil-
ity cannot be excluded that part of the observed metabo-

particularly
from

since it was regarded unethical to pause an established HF

 nosed HFrEF patients but also non-HFrEF controls tak-
ing cardiovascular medication—will be needed to more
accurately address the effects of medication. Efforts are
also ongoing to overcome the limitations posed by the
LC-MS/MS detection method used in this study (turn-
around time, cost, ease-of-use) by developing an enzy-
matic assay for detecting the lipid markers that is amena-
ble to established analytical platforms.
