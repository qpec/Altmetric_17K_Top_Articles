IMPORTANCE The high mortality rate in critically ill elderly patients has led to questioning of
the beneficial effect of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and to a variable ICU use among
this population.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether a recommendation for systematic ICU admission in
critically ill elderly patients reduces 6-month mortality compared with usual practice.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, cluster-randomized clinical trial of 3037
critically ill patients aged 75 years or older, free of cancer, with preserved functional status
(Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living �4) and nutritional status (absence of
cachexia) who arrived at the emergency department of one of 24 hospitals in France between
January 2012 and April 2015 and were followed up until November 2015.
INTERVENTIONS Centers were randomly assigned either to use a program to promote
systematic ICU admission of patients (n=1519 participants) or to follow standard practice
(n=1518 participants).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was death at 6 months. Secondary
outcomes included ICU admission rate, in-hospital death, functional status, and quality of life
(12-Item Short Form Health Survey, ranging from 0 to 100, with higher score representing
better self-reported health) at 6 months.
RESULTS One patient withdrew consent, leaving 3036 patients included in the trial
(median age, 85 [interquartile range, 81-89] years; 1361 [45%] men). Patients in the systematic
strategy group had an increased risk of death at 6 months (45% vs 39%; relative risk [RR], 1.16;
95% CI, 1.07-1.26) despite an increased ICU admission rate (61% vs 34%; RR, 1.80; 95% CI,
1.66-1.95). After adjustments for baseline characteristics, patients in the systematic strategy
group were more likely to be admitted to an ICU (RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.54-1.82) and had a higher
risk of in-hospital death (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03-1.33) but had no significant increase in risk of
death at 6 months (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.96-1.14). Functional status and physical quality of life
at 6 months were not significantly different between groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among critically ill elderly patients in France, a program to
promote systematic ICU admission increased ICU use but did not reduce 6-month mortality.
Additional research is needed to understand the decision to admit elderly patients to the ICU.

 T
he aging of the population leads to an increased de-
mand for intensive care among elderly patients.1 These
patientsnowaccountfor10%to20%ofallintensivecare
unit (ICU) admissions, and this trend continues to increase.2
In a context of expenditures control in health care, appropri-
ate intensive care resource utilization is an important issue.2
Yet many physicians have doubts as to whether elderly pa-
tients benefit from ICU admission.3 Previous studies have
focused on the benefit of intensive care for adult patients.1,4
However, elderly patients have an age-related diminution of
physiological reserve, a higher prevalence of chronic dis-
eases, and more common frailty.5 These age-related physi-
ological and pathological changes make elderly patients more
vulnerable to stress due to acute illnesses, putting them at high
risk of death when critically ill, making the benefit of ICU ad-
mission uncertain in this population.6,7
To date, there has been no randomized clinical trial of
ICU triage in elderly patients. Observational studies have
reported conflicting results: some studies suggested ben-
efits from ICU admission8,9 while others did not.6,10 These
uncertainties, coupled with the absence of triage guidelines
adapted to elderly patients,3 lead to wide heterogeneity
in clinical practices regarding ICU admission among elderly
patients.6
The Intensive Care for Elderly–CUB-Réa 2 (ICE-CUB 2) trial
was a cluster-randomized clinical trial to determine whether
a recommendation for systematic ICU admission in critically
ill elderly patients reduces 6-month mortality compared with
usual practice.
Methods
The trial was approved by the Comité de Protection des
Personnesd’
Ile-de-France9.Participantsortheirsurrogatede-
cision makers were informed orally about the trial, and their
nonopposition to trial participation was recorded in patient’
files. In accordance with French law, written informed con-
sent was not required because both interventions are part of
standard care. Patients who were eligible but incapable of re-
ceiving information and for whom a surrogate decision maker
was not available might be included by deferred information.
These participants were informed about study participation
as soon as they were able to understand information. Infor-
mation was collected during a 6-month follow-up period. Par-
ticipants were informed that the authorization to use patient
data could be withdrawn at any time. Details on steering com-
mittee members and conduct of the study are available in the
eAppendix in Supplement 1.
The study protocol is available in Supplement 2. In brief,
in this cluster-randomized clinical trial conducted in 24 hos-
pitals in France from January 2012 through November 2015,
academic and nonacademic hospitals with at least 1 emer-
gency department and 1 ICU were randomly assigned either
to the intervention or the control group.
The allocation schedule was independently estab-
lished by a statistician at the clinical research unit using a
computer-generated randomization list. Randomization was
stratified by the median annual number of emergency
department visits in participating centers (n=44 616), pres-
ence or absence of a geriatric ward, and geographical area
(Paris area vs other regions in France). Each site allocation
was kept secret by the clinical research unit until the training
of the study personnel was completed and was revealed to
the hospital primary investigators at the beginning of the
inclusion period. Due to the study design, no allocation con-
cealment was possible.
In hospitals assigned to the systematic strategy group
(intervention), a program to promote systematic ICU admis-
sion was implemented. In this program, emergency depart-
ment and ICU physicians were asked to systematically rec-
ommend an ICU admission for all included patients during
the triage process. Other interventions to promote ICU
admission included the following: a member of the steering
committee visited each center and presented the trial proto-
col; when including a participant in the trial, the emergency
department physician was required to systematically call the
attending ICU physician; the ICU physician was required to
systematically evaluate the patient at the bedside; and the
emergency department and ICU physicians were required to
jointly decide whether to admit the patient to the ICU with
consideration of participant or surrogate decision-maker
opinions about ICU admission. If no ICU bed was available in
the hospital, the patient had to be transferred to an ICU
located in another hospital. Monthly meetings were orga-
nized with the emergency department and ICU staff. Book-
lets and posters presenting the recommendations for ICU
admission were used.
In hospitals assigned to the standard practice (control)
group, there was no specific recommendation regarding the
ICU triage process. In both groups, the final decision for ad-
mission was made by the physicians at the bedside.
Participant Selection
All patients aged 75 years or older who arrived in the emer-
gency department were assessed for eligibility. Patients were
included if they had one of the preestablished critical condi-
tions listed in eTable 1 in Supplement 1, had preserved func-
tional status as defined by an Index of Independence in
Activities of Daily Living score of 4 or higher or not evaluable,11
Key Points
Question Does a program to increase intensive care unit (ICU)
admission rates among critically ill elderly patients have a
beneficial effect on long-term outcomes?
Findings In this cluster-randomized clinical trial of 3036 critically
ill patients aged 75 years or older, a recommendation for
systematic ICU admission led to a significantly higher ICU
admission rate but had no significant effect on mortality at
6 months vs standard practice (adjusted relative risk, 1.05).
Meaning A program to promote systematic ICU admission among
critically ill elderly patients increased ICU use but did not reduce
6-month mortality.

 had preserved nutritional status (defined as absence of ca-
chexia,subjectivelyassessedbyphysiciansatthebedside),and
were free of active cancer. Exclusion criteria were an emer-
gency department stay of more than 24 hours, a secondary re-
ferral to the emergency department, and refusal to partici-
pate. Patients in whom cancer was diagnosed after inclusion
remained in the statistical analysis. Further information on in-
clusion and exclusion criteria and follow-up are available in
the eAppendix in Supplement 1.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was overall mortality at 6 months. Sec-
ondary outcomes were ICU admission rate, in-hospital mor-
tality, functional status at 6 months as assessed by the Index
of Independence in Activities of Daily Living,11 and quality of
life at 6 months as assessed by the 12-Item Short-Form Health
Survey.12 The Index of Independence in Activities of Daily
Living11 is based on an evaluation of the functional indepen-
dence or dependence of patients in bathing, dressing, toilet-
ing, transferring, continence, and feeding and ranges from 0
(totally dependent) to 6 (independent). The 12-Item Short-
Form Health Survey12,13 is a measure of health-related quality
of life and includes a physical and mental component; the
score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing
better self-reported health. Other secondary outcomes were
the characteristics of the triage process: opinions about ICU
admission and involvement of physicians and participants in
the decision process and the number of ICUs with all beds
filled. Caregiver burden14 at 6 months was assessed in 2 cen-
ters and is not reported in this article. For patients discharged
alive, information on outcomes were obtained through tele-
phone calls, either directly from patients, from patients’rela-
tives or general practitioners, or from appropriate legal insti-
tutions. Data on patients who were lost to follow-up before 6
months were censored at the last follow-up assessment.
Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis plan is available in Supplement 3.
Assumptions based on sample size calculation were based on
the ICE-CUB 1 study.6 Considering an estimated 32%
6-month mortality rate in the control group and an estimated
intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.01, a sample size of
2802 was required to have 74% power to detect a 6% differ-
ence in mortality rates in a 2-sided test at a .05 level of sig-
nificance. Twenty-four hospitals agreed to participate
instead of 20 initially planned; to take into account cluster
randomization with inflation dependent on intraclass corre-
lation coefficient, the number of patients to be included was
increased to 3000. The absolute reduction of 6% in mortality
was established as a compromise resulting in a feasible
sample size and a clinically relevant reduction in mortality.15
Recruitment was ultimately ended when the targeted sample
size was achieved in each cluster.
Baseline characteristics of patients were analyzed as
frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and
as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous
variables. Bivariable associations were evaluated using the
t test for continuous variables and the χ2 or Fisher exact
test for categorical variables as appropriate. Variables for
all adjusted analyses were age, illness severity, initial clinical
diagnosis, seniority of the emergency physician, time of
ICU admission, baseline functional status, living place, and
type of home support. Generalized estimating equation
methods using robust sandwich estimators to estimate
the variance-covariance matrix of the regression coefficient
estimates were used to account for clustering. Binary out-
comes (ICU admission rate, in-hospital death, death within 6
months, change in Index of Independence in Activities
of Daily Living11) were analyzed using logistic regression
models. Absolute risk differences and relative risks (RRs)
were derived from logistic regression models and 95% confi-
dence intervals for these measures were obtained using
nonparametric bootstrap methods with 1000 samples.16
The crude overall survival at 6 months was estimated by the
Kaplan-Meier method and compared using a log-rank test.
The 6-month survival adjusted for baseline characteristics
was estimated using a Cox model. Adjusted survival curves
were produced using an inverse probability-weighted
Kaplan-Meier estimation. Significance was tested using
a Cox regression model weighted by the same weights
(inverse probability-weighted Cox). Health-related quality of
life at 6 months was analyzed using linear regression models.
We used multiple imputation for participants with missing
data, using predictive mean matching for continuous vari-
ables, logistic regression for binary data, and polytomous
regression for (unordered) categorical data. Ten imputations
were drawn.
The analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat ba-
sisaccordingtotheprespecifiedanalysisplan,withoutplanned
interim analysis. A post hoc exploratory analysis was per-
formed to compare the characteristics of patients admitted to
the ICU in each group. All analyses were performed at a 2-sided
α=.05;aP<.05wasconsideredstatisticallysignificant.Allanaly-
ses were performed by A.B. with R software, version 3.2.2
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing).
Results
Between January 2012 and April 2015, a total of 3037 patients
were enrolled in the trial, with 1519 patients in 11 hospitals ran-
domized to the systematic strategy group and 1518 patients in
13 hospitals randomized to the standard practice group
(Figure1).Therecruitingratewashigherinthesystematicstrat-
egy group compared with the standard practice group. To
achieve the total number of participants needed, the recruit-
ing period was extended in the hospitals randomized to the
standard practice group. The mean inclusion period was 22.5
months in the systematic strategy group and 28.5 months in
the standard practice group. One patient subsequently with-
drew consent, leaving a total of 3036 patients. There were 12
medical and 12 mixed (medical and surgical) ICUs.

 81-89 years); 45% (1361/3036) were men. The most frequent
initial clinical diagnoses for hospital admission were septic
shock (413/3036 [13.6%]), acute respiratory failure requiring
noninvasive ventilation (347/3036 [11.4%]), severe pneumo-
nia (250/3036 [8.2%]), and cardiac insufficiency requiring
noninvasive ventilation (218/3036 [7.2%]) (a complete list is
available in eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Patients in the sys-
tematic strategy group had a higher severity of illness at
admission, as reflected by a higher Simplified Acute Physi-
ology Score III score.18
Characteristics of the Triage Process
In the systematic strategy group, physicians inquired more
often about patients’or surrogate decision makers’opinions
about ICU admission (750/1518 [49%] vs 359/1518 [24%];
difference in proportions, 25%; 95% CI, 22%-29%; P < .001),
intensive care physicians were more often involved in the
triage process (1474/1518 [97%] vs 938/1518 [62%]; differ-
ence in proportions, 35%; 95% CI, 33%-38%; P < .001) and
were more favorable to an ICU admission (1111/1474 [75%]
vs 623/938 [66%]; difference in proportions, 9%; 95% CI,
5%-13%; P < .001), and patients were more favorable to an
ICU admission (414/470 [88%] vs 145/220 [66%]; difference
in proportions, 22%; 95% CI, 15%-29%; P < .001) than in
the standard practice group. More information about the tri-
age process is available in Table 2 and eTable 3 in Supplement
1. Information on protocol violations is available in eTable 4
in Supplement 1.
Primary Outcome
At 6 months, there were a total of 1273 deaths, 685 deaths in
the systematic strategy group and 588 deaths in the standard
practice group (Table 3). Patients in the systematic strategy
group had an increased risk of death at 6 months (685/1518
[45%] vs 588/1518 [39%]; difference in proportions, 6% [95%
CI, 3%-10%]; P < .001; RR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.07-1.26]), but the dif-
ference did not remain significant after adjustments for base-
line characteristics (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.96-1.14). Crude and ad-
justed survival curves according to group assignment are
presented in Figure 2.
Secondary Outcomes
Intensive care unit admission rate was higher in the system-
atic strategy group (932/1518 [61%] vs 516/1518 [34%]; differ-
ence in proportions, 27% [95% CI, 24%-31%]; P < .001; RR,
1.80 [95% CI, 1.66-1.95]), and the difference remained signifi-
cant after adjustments for baseline characteristics (RR, 1.68;
95% CI, 1.54-1.82) (Table 3). One patient for which a decision
for ICU refusal had been made was finally admitted to the
ICU (eTable 5 in Supplement 1).
A post hoc analysis was conducted to compare patients
admitted to the ICU in each group (eTable 6 in Supplement 1).
Patients admitted to the ICU in the systematic strategy group
had a higher Simplified Acute Physiology Score III18 score
(difference in medians, 3; 95% CI, 2-5; P < .001), more often
underwent mechanical ventilation (374/884 [42%] vs
147/470 [31%]; difference in proportions, 11%; 95% CI,

ference remained significant after adjustments for baseline
characteristics (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03-1.33) (Table 3).
Patients discharged alive from the hospital in the systematic
strategy group had an increased length of hospital stay vs
patients in the standard practice group (16.8 [SD, 16.2] days
in the systematic strategy group and 13.6 [SD, 20.1] days in
the standard practice group; difference in means, 3.2 days;
95% CI, 1.7-4.7 days; P < .001).
There was a greater decrease from baseline Index of
Independence in Activities of Daily Living at 6 months in the
systematic strategy group than in the standard practice group
(median of the difference between follow-up and baseline
scores, –0.5 [IQR, –2.0 to 0.0] vs –0.5 [IQR, –1.5 to 0.0];
P = .02; difference in means, –0.20; 95% CI, –0.37 to –0.03)
(detailed baseline and follow-up data are reported in eTables
7 and 8 in Supplement 1). The probability of a decrease in at
least 1 of the Index of Independence in Activities of Daily
Living18 domains was not significantly different between
groups after adjustments for baseline characteristics (RR,
1.02; 95% CI, 0.99-1.05) (Table 3). Self-reported physical
quality of life at 6 months was not significantly different
between groups (mean score, 36.7 vs 36.2; difference in
means, 0.5 [95% CI, –0.6 to 1.5]). Self-reported mental quality
of life at 6 months was higher in the systematic strategy
group (mean score, 44.6 vs 43.7; difference in means, 0.9
[95% CI, 0.1-1.6]) (Table 3). Additional data at 6-month
follow-up are available in eTable 9 in Supplement 1.
Discussion
In this trial, a program to promote systematic ICU admission
of critically ill elderly patients led to a higher ICU admission
rate and hospital mortality but after adjustment for baseline
characteristics had no significant effect on mortality, func-
tional status, or physical health-related quality of life at 6
months.Theobservedstatisticallysignificantdifferenceinme-

These results are consistent with the ICE-CUB 1
study,6,19 a prospective, multicenter observational study of
2646 critically ill patients aged 80 years or older, which sug-
gested no mortality benefit at 6 months after ICU admission

 (50.6% vs 50.7%). Other observational studies reported con-
troversial results: 2 studies suggested decreased mortality
at 1 month8,9 in patients admitted vs not admitted to the
ICU, whereas 1 study did not observe mortality benefit at
1 year.10 Limitations of these studies are their retrospective
or observational design without randomization, their
heterogeneity in age cutoff for inclusion and in adjustments
for known prognostic factors, and the absence of consider-
ation of the triage process by the emergency department
physicians before the ICU referral.20
The mortality rates were also consistent with available
data in the literature. Recent observational data on critically
ill elderly patients admitted to the ICU suggested in-hospital
mortality rates ranging from 24% to 40%,1,10,21-23 3-month
mortality rates from 39% to 41%,1,17,24 6-month mortality
rates from 37% to 51%,1,6,25 and 1-year mortality rates from
44% to 68%.1,10,17,21,23 In the current trial, the selection of
patients with preserved baseline functional and nutritional
status and free of active cancer may explain the observed
low rates of in-hospital (26%) and 6-month (42%) mortality
compared with observational data. The higher in-hospital
mortality rate observed in the systematic strategy group
may be explained in part by the fact that a higher ICU
admission rate in the intervention group might have pre-
cipitated early discussions about or more frequent with-
drawals of life-sustaining therapies, possibly leading to a
higher mortality rate in the systematic strategy group. How-
ever, the ICU and hospital lengths of stay and the number of
patients with at least 1 organ in need of support were similar
between the 2 groups.
To our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical
trial evaluating the effect of ICU triage on long-term mortal-
ity in an elderly population. Randomization by cluster (hos-
pital) allowed evaluation of the effect of ICU triage without
difficulties incurred by ethical considerations of randomiza-
tion for ICU admission at an individual patient level. The
intervention program led to different ICU admission rates
between groups. Furthermore, senior physicians were more
frequently involved in the triage decision-making process,
and the decisions were frequently shared between physi-
cians. However, despite a recommendation for systematic
ICU admission in the intervention group, more than one-
third of patients were not admitted to the ICU. This was
expected, as physicians had the final decision for ICU
admission and could refuse an ICU admission even if the
hospital was randomized to the intervention group.
This trial has several strengths. First, the design takes
into account the 2 steps of the triage process by both emer-
gency department and intensive care physicians. This
avoided potential bias related to variation in triage criteria
for ICU admission proposal by emergency department phy-
sicians. Second, participants were patients without long-
term adverse outcome factors as identified in the ICE-CUB 1
study,6 to avoid inclusion of patients with very high

 expected mortality. Third, the trial was pragmatic, which
contributes to the generalizability of the results. Fourth, in
addition to survival analyses, this trial assessed functional
status and quality of life, which are important and relevant
outcomes in the elderly population. Fifth, there were very
few protocol violations, allowing for an intention-to-treat
analysis, and few patients were lost to follow-up.
This study also has several limitations. First, the re-
cruitment period in the standard practice cluster was longer
that in the systematic strategy cluster, which could have
introduced confounding due to secular changes. Second,
because of the nature of the intervention, no blinding to
group assignment was possible. However, the effect of the
nonblinded design on 6-month mortality is considered low.
Third, data on withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies were
not collected. Fourth, the potential benefits of ICU admis-
sion might be confounded by recruitment of patients who
were more severely ill in the systematic strategy group.
However, results were adjusted for several baseline charac-
teristics, including illness severity. Fifth, the benefits of
increased ICU admission could accrue only to patients who
would normally have received floor care but instead
received ICU care. In this study, the question of whether
benefit might accrue to patients on the margin was not
addressed. However, because of the design of the study,
variation in individual probability of ICU admission is likely
to be small. Sixth, a qualitative approach to understand why
patients were not admitted to the ICU was not conducted.
Seventh, differences in the quality of care provided in the
wards may affect the outcome. For example, ward admission
as an alternative to the ICU might partially explain the nega-
tive results observed in the present study when patients
were admitted to wards providing very good care. The clus-
ter design and sample size should reduce this potential bias
because hospitals with emergency departments and ICUs
were randomized. Moreover, patients already in the hospital
(secondary transfer) or admitted from another hospital were
excluded to minimize the effect of previous quality of care
on prognosis. Nonetheless, the hospitals that had lower ICU
admission rates at baseline may in particular have developed

 higher-quality ward care; thus, a strategy to boost ICU
admission rates may not have yielded the same gains in out-
come in such centers as in other settings.
The findings of this study may be informative for health
care delivery from a hospital perspective. When considering
the increasing demand for intensive care among elderly
patients, the importance of health care resource allocation
and expenditure control, and the possible absence of long-
term benefit of intensive care, systematic ICU admission of
all critically ill elderly patients might not be warranted. How-
ever, this study should not be interpreted as suggesting that
no elderly patient should be admitted to the ICU. Because of
substantial uncertainty in outcomes among individual
patients, there is a need to systematically and thoughtfully
assess the potential benefits and harms of ICU admission for
every elderly patient presenting with critical illness.
