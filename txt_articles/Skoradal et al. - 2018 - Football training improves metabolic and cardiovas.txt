INTRODUCTION
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major worldwide 
health challenge associated with considerable morbidity and 
mortality, and additionally, it is imposing a significant eco-
nomic burden on the healthcare system.1 Globally, it is esti-
mated that the number of patients with T2DM will increase 
to around 370 million by 2030.1,2 For example, in the United 
States alone, the incidence of T2DM increased 117% from 
1980 to 2011 and as many as one in three adults are projected 
to develop T2DM by 2050 if current trends continue.3
T2DM is a pathological condition partly related to life-
styles such as physical inactivity and poor nutritional hab-
its. Moreover, the latest recommendations on diabetes care 
concluded that education on self- 
management is essen-
tial.4 Within these recommendations, patients with diabetes

We examined the effects of 16 weeks of football training and dietary advice on blood 
glucose control and health status in 55- 
 to 70- 
year- 
old women and men with predia-
betes. Fifty participants with prediabetes (age; 61 ± 6 years, BMI; 29.6 ± 4.7; 
VO2max 22.3 ± 5.7 mL·min−1·kg−1) were randomized into a football and dietary ad-
vice group (F+D; n = 27) and a dietary advice group (D; n = 23). F+D performed 
football training (twice weekly 30- 
 to 60- 
minutes sessions) and received dietary ad-
vice, while D only received dietary advice. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 
was completed pre and post the 16- 
week period. Body composition, blood pressure, 
and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) were additionally measured. Both groups 
demonstrated a decrement (P < .05) in fasting blood glucose (−0.4 ± 0.5 mmol·L−1) 
and lowered blood glucose throughout OGTT. F+D displayed lower values than D 
(P < .05) after 60 minutes (9.0 ± 2.7 vs 10.6 ± 2.9 mmol·L−1) and 120 minutes 
(5.7 ± 1.6 vs 7.5 ± 2.4 mmol·L−1). VO2max increased by 14% in F+D, with a higher 
(P < .05) change score than in D (2%). Mean arterial pressure declined more 
(P < .05) in F+D than in D (−8 ± 9 vs −4 ± 11 mm Hg). Fat loss was greater 
(P < .05) in F+D than in D (−3.4 ± 2.8 vs −1.2 ± 2.0 kg), and the increase in lean 
body mass was also greater (P < .05) in F+D than in D (0.7 ± 1.5 vs −0.3 ± 1.6 kg). 
In conclusion, football training combined with dietary advice has broad- 
spectrum 
effects on metabolic and cardiovascular health profile with greater overall effects 
than professional dietary advice per se for 55- 
 to 70- 
year- 
old women and men with 
prediabetes.

are instructed to perform at least 150 minutes per week of 
moderate- 
intensity aerobic physical activity combined with 
resistance training at least twice per week.5 Moreover, nu-
trition therapy is included as an integral part of the self- 
management education in individuals with T2DM.4
T2DM is preceded by a progressive impairment in glu-
cose regulation or prediabetes defined by impaired fasting 
glycemia (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).5 In ad-
dition to a deterioration in blood glucose control, patients 
with T2DM often suffer from other serious health compli-
cations, such as poor physical fitness, obesity, low muscle 
mass, and cardiovascular deficiencies.6 Exercise training 
has been shown to improve blood glucose regulation and 
is proposed for inclusion in the treatment of patients with 
prediabetes and T2DM.7 Thus, development of efficient ex-
ercise training protocols for these patient groups is highly 
warranted.
Football training has been extensively studied during 
the last decade and proves to be a complex exercise train-
ing method that results in broad- 
spectrum health effects.8 For 
example, football training two to three times per week has 
been shown to improve metabolic and cardiovascular health 
in sedentary hypertensive women.9 Moreover, improved 
blood glucose control and general health profile have been 
demonstrated in both male and female patients with T2DM 
after recreational football training interventions.9,10 Indeed, 
a recent study by de Sousa et al11 showed that a combination 
of 12 weeks of football training and a caloric- 
restricted diet 
markedly improved glucose regulation and reduced markers 
of muscle catabolism, with greater changes than diet approach 
alone. Thus, it is interesting and appears plausible to suggest 
that football training may facilitate blood glucose control 
in patients with prediabetes. Football training is especially 
likely to have major potential as a treatment protocol for pa-
tients with prediabetes and may prevent or delay the onset of 
the disease, due to the broad- 
spectrum effects encompassing 
both major metabolic and cardiovascular benefits.
It is well- 
known that aging results in marked deteriorations 
in health profile. For example, meta- 
analysis has demonstrated 
that mortality can be reduced by physical activity in elderly 
people up to the age of eighty.12 The prevalence of T2DM also 
accelerates markedly with increasing age,13 and low physical 
capacity has been substantiated to be an independent marker 
of mortality in patients with T2DM14 Thus, it is highly rele-
vant to develop treatment protocols for patients with prediabe-
tes prior to old age. Recently, a T2DM prevalence screening 
study was conducted in the Faroe Islands based on glycated 
hemoglobin (HbA1c levels) and an oral glucose tolerance 
test (OGTT; Veyhe et al personal communication). The study 
demonstrated a high prevalence, with ~10% of the population 
between 40 and 74 years being diagnosed with T2DM and 
another ~15% having glycemic disturbances. This national 
cohort was used to recruit participants with prediabetes aged 
55- 
70 years of age to take part in this study.
Thus, the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that 
football training combined with dietary advice is more ef-
ficient as a treatment protocol for patients with prediabetes 
aged 55- 
70 years than dietary advice alone.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Participants
The participants in this study were recruited from a 
population- 
based cross- 
sectional survey which aimed to de-
termine the prevalence of T2DM and prediabetes among the 
population aged 40- 
74 years in the Faroe Islands. The study 
included 1772 individuals (corresponding to ~10% of the 
entire population aged 40- 
74 years) (Veyhe et al, personal 
communication).
A total of 117 individuals aged 55- 
70 years living on the 
Faroe Islands at the recruiting time diagnosed with predia-
betes (HbA1c ≥ 5.8% (40 mmol·mol−1)) received a letter of 
invitation to participate in the study. The letter contained in-
formation about the study and the various tests that the par-
ticipants would undergo. Thereafter, the letter was followed 
up by a phone call to clarify any questions and to invite the 
patients to an informational group meeting near their resi-
dence. Participants that took part in regular physical activity 
were excluded. Participants using beta- 
blockers were also ex-
cluded, while participants using other antihypertensive drugs 
such as thiazides and angiotensin receptor blockers (n = 25) 
were included. In addition, participants taking medication for 
high plasma cholesterol levels such as statins (n = 16) were 
included. Finally, three participants included in the study 
were taking anti- 
asthmatic drugs. None of the participants 
changed their drug usage during the intervention period. 
After being informed in writing and verbally of the experi-
mental procedures and associated risks, 55 persons (28 men 
and 27 women; see Table 1) accepted to participate in the 
study and gave their written consent. The study was approved 
by the ethical committee of the Faroe Islands and conducted 
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964).

2.2 | Experimental design
The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. 
The participants reported to the laboratory on four sepa-
rate occasions over a 12- 
day period. On visit 1, the par-
ticipants had a fasting blood sample taken and completed 
an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), as described by 
Connolly et al15 In addition, blood pressure and resting 
heart rate were recorded. On visit 2, body composition was 
assessed with a DXA scan, scaling body mass, and measur-
ing waist and hip circumference, as previously.16 On visit 
3, the participants performed an incremental cycling test to 
exhaustion with measurements of maximal oxygen uptake 
(VO2max), pulmonary ventilation (VE), and maximal heart 
rate (HRmax). The primary endpoint was blood glucose ki-
netics during the OGTT, whereas the secondary endpoints 
were blood lipid profile, body composition, blood pressure, 
resting heart rate, and VO2max. On visit 4, dietary advice 
was given by a registered dietitian in a 3- 
hours group- 
based 
session. Subsequently, the participants were randomized to 
a football and dietary advice group (F+D; n = 32) and a 
dietary advice group (D; n = 23). Males and females were 
randomized separately to ensure an equal gender distribu-
tion in the two groups. There were five dropouts from the 
F+D group (due to low training attendance; <1 session per 
week, which was the minimum criteria for training comple-
tion), of which two were men and three were women, re-
sulting in 27 participants completing the F+D intervention. 
There were no dropouts from D (n = 23). Thus, the final 
sample consisted of 50 participants. There were examples 
of severe muscle soreness as result of the football training 
in the initial phase of the intervention period, but no serious 
injuries occurred.
2.3 | Resting blood sampling and 
OGTT testing
On the day of testing, the participants reported to the lab-
oratory after transport by car or bus. No training was per-
formed 48- 
72 hours prior to testing, and the participants were 
instructed to avoid physical activity on the day prior to the 
OGTT tests. Using a venipuncture technique, a resting blood 
sample was taken under standardized conditions from an 
antecubital vein between 7 am and 8 am after an overnight 
fast. The blood was rapidly centrifuged for 30 seconds and 
the plasma collected and analyzed by an automatic analyzer 
(Cobas Fara, Roche, France) using enzymatic kits (Roche 
Diagnostics, Germany) to determine plasma total cholesterol, 
HDL, LDL, triglycerides, C- 
reactive protein, and vitamin D.
Additionally, an OGTT test was performed as previously 
described,17 with blood samples taken after 0, 30, 60, and 
120 minutes and analyzed for plasma [glucose] using enzy-
matic kits (Roche Diagnostics, Germany). Changes in plasma 
[glucose] during the OGTT were also quantified using total 
area under the curve (tAUC) analyses employing the trape-
zium rule (GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA). The intra- 
assay 
coefficient of variations for glucose is 3.0 ± 3.5%.
2.4 | Maximal oxygen uptake, pulmonary 
ventilation, and performance
On a separate day, the participants reported to the laboratory 
in a postabsorptive state (at least 4 hours), having refrained 
from vigorous exercise, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine dur-
ing the previous 24 hours. To ensure standardization of nu-
tritional and hydration status, the participants recorded their 
food and fluid intakes for the 48- 
hours period prior to the 
first trial so that the diet could be repeated for the remainder 
of the trial. The participants did not consume any fluid dur-
ing the experimental trials. Maximal oxygen consumption 
(VO2max) was determined for each individual by means of an 
incremental cycling test to volitional exhaustion on an elec-
tronically braked cycle ergometer (Excalibur Sport, Lode, 
Groningen, Netherlands). The test was performed under 
standard laboratory conditions (20°C; 40% relative humid-
ity). VO2max was determined as the highest value achieved 
over a 20- 
seconds period. A plateau in VO2, despite an in-
creased speed, and a respiratory exchange ratio (RER) >1.15 
were used as criteria for VO2max achievement. The test was 
initiated at 0 W and increased by 20 W every minute until

the participants could no longer handle the given load. The 
participants maintained a cadence of 60, 65, or 70 rep·min−1 
based on individual preference. Pulmonary VO2 and VE were 
measured throughout the protocol by a breath- 
by- 
breath gas 
analyzing system (model Cosmed, Quark b2, Milan, Italy). 
The analyzer was calibrated before each test with two gases 
of known oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations as well 
as by the use of a 3- 
liter syringe for the tube flowmeter cali-
bration. The end- 
power output (cycling load at the point of 
volitional exhaustion) was noted as the exercise performance 
marker.
2.5 | Blood pressure measurements
The participants reported at the hospital at 8.00 am after an 
overnight fast and rested in a supine position for 2 hours. 
Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure 
(DBP) were measured according to standard procedures18 
using an automatic BP monitor (HEM- 
709; OMRON, IL, 
US) once every 30 minutes over the 2- 
hours resting period. 
The average of the four measurements was used as the test re-
sult. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated as 1/3 SBP 
+ 2/3 DBP. Resting heart rate (RHR) was measured during 
the same time intervals as for BP.
2.6 | Body composition
Whole- 
body fat and lean body mass (LBM) were evaluated 
by total- 
body DXA scanning (Norland XR- 
800, Norland 
Corporation, Oslo, Norway). The body was segmented in ac-
cordance with standard procedures to evaluate regional tissue 
distribution, and all analyses were performed using Illuminatus 
DXA software (Norland Corporation, Oslo, Norway). The ef-
fective radiation dose was <0.2 mSv per scan.
2.7 | Training intervention
The F+D participants completed a total of 32 ± 2 (19- 
46) 
football training sessions over the 16- 
week intervention pe-
riod, corresponding to 2.0 ± 0.1 (1.2- 
2.9) sessions per week. 
Four training sessions were organized by week, and the par-
ticipants were encouraged to take part in 2- 
3 sessions per 
week. Each session lasted 30- 
60 minutes (30 minutes during 
weeks 0- 
2, 40 minutes during weeks 3- 
4, 50 minutes during 
weeks 5- 
6, and 60 minutes during weeks 7- 
16). The sessions 
were organized with two halves separated by 2- 
3 minutes 
of recovery). All sessions were organized as small- 
sided 
games (4v4- 
6v6), as previously described.19 All sessions 
were preceded by a 10- 
minutes warm- 
up period.16 Heart rate 
was measured during one training session in week 4 and one 
session in week 12 of the intervention, and mean and peak 
heart rate were 127 ± 5 and 153 ± 4 bpm, respectively, cor-
responding to 79 ± 1 and 96 ± 1%HRmax, respectively.
2.8 | Dietary intervention
All participants were given group- 
based dietary advice by 
a registered dietitian and provided with a standardized meal 
plan. The meal plan aimed to improve glycemic control, to 
reduce the risk of worsening the cardiometabolic profile, and 
to maintain a healthy body weight. Weight loss in diabetic 
subjects may provide clinical benefits such as improved gly-
cemia, blood pressure and lipids.4 Thus, the meal plan was 
semilow caloric providing 1800 and 2300 kilocalories per 
day for women and men, respectively. Studies of group- 
based diabetes education have reported HbA1C decreases of 
0.5%- 
2.0% for patients with T2DM.4 The main principles of 
the meal plan were substituting high- 
starch and high- 
sucrose 
foods with low- 
glycemic natural fiber- 
rich plant foods.20 In 
accordance with the official Danish dietary recommenda-
tions, the recommended vegetable intake was 300 g per day 
and fruit consumption was limited to two to three pieces per 
day in order to limit fructose intake.20,21 The participants were 
instructed to minimize the consumption of sucrose- 
containing 
foods, especially sugar- 
sweetened beverages, and to substi-
tute starchy foods with wholemeal foods such as wholemeal 
bread, pasta, and rice.22 The recommended intake of saturated 
fat, dietary cholesterol, and trans fat is the same for diabetic 
subjects as for the healthy population.4,22 However, based on 
Danish dietary surveys, the participants were advised to in-
crease the consumption of foods containing long- 
chain n- 
3 
fatty acids (EPA and DHA) from fatty fish. 23
2.9 | Statistical analysis
Data are presented as means ± SD. Statistical analyses were 
performed using SPSS v.22. A two- 
factor mixed ANOVA 
design with the between- 
factor “group” (F+D vs D) and

repeated factor “condition” (pre- 
 vs postintervention) was 
used. When significant main effects were detected, data were 
subsequently analyzed using Bonferroni post- 
hoc t tests. The 
significance level was P < .05.

RESULTS
3.1 | Body composition
Body mass was 85.0 ± 15.1 and 89.9 ± 18.4 kg at base-
line in F+D and D, respectively. Body mass was lowered 
(P < .05) by 2.4 ± 2.9 kg postintervention in F+D with a 
greater (P < .05) change score than D (1.5 ± 3.4 kg). Total 
body fat percentage was 35.3 ± 8.7 and 39.1 ± 9.9% at base-
line in F+D and D, but declined (P < .05) more in F+D 
than in D, being 32.1 ± 9.0 and 38.3 ± 9.8%, respectively, 
postintervention. The intervention- 
induced fat loss in F+D 
was −3.4 ± 2.8 kg, which was greater (P < .05) than in D 
(−1.2 ± 2.0 kg; Figure 1). LBM was similar in F+D and D 
(53.3 ± 11.9 and 53.6 ± 14.2 kg, respectively) and increased 
(P < .05) from pre- 
 to postintervention by 0.7 ± 1.5 kg in 
F+D, which was more (P < .05) than in D (−0.3 ± 1.6 kg; 
Figure 1). Hip and waist circumference were 102 ± 8 and 
98 ± 7 cm in F+D and 105 ± 11 and 103 ± 10 cm in D pre-
intervention, and waist circumference was lowered (P < .05) 
by 5 ± 4 cm in F+D and 2 ± 5 cm in D postintervention, 
with a greater (P < .05) change score in F+D than in D.
3.2 | Blood pressure
SBP and DBP were 138 ± 16 and 84 ± 11 mm Hg in F+D 
and 142 ± 18 and 87 ± 11 mm Hg in D at baseline, but

decreased (P < .05) to 127 ± 15 and 77 ± 10 mm Hg in 
F+D, which was a greater (P < .05) change score than in D 
(Figure 2). MAP was reduced (P < .05) by −8 ± 9 mm Hg 
in F+D and showed a greater (P < .05) change score than D 
(−4 ± 11 mm Hg; Figure 2).
3.3 | Maximal oxygen uptake, pulmonary 
ventilation, and resting heart rate
F+D had an intervention- 
induced increase (P < .05) in 
VO2max of 3.4 ± 3.0 mL·min−1·kg−1, corresponding to 14%, 
which was greater (P < .05) than a nonsignificant change of 
0.5 ± 5.9 mL·min−1·kg−1 in D (Figure 3). VE was 74.2 ± 14.2 
and 67.5 ± 15.5 L·min−1 in F+D and D, respectively, at base-
line with higher (P < .05) values in F+D. Postintervention, 
VE was increased (P < .05) by 5.0 ± 10.0 L·min−1 in F+D 
with a greater change score than in D (0.3 ± 11 L·min−1). 
End- 
power output was 183 ± 36 and 173 ± 43 W at base-
line in F+D and D, respectively. Postintervention, F+D had 
increased (P < .05) end- 
power output by 10%, which was a 
greater change than in the D group. RHR was 73 ± 10 and 
72 ± 12 b·min−1 in F+D and D at baseline, but was lowered 
postintervention in F+D only (−5 ± 5 vs −2 ± 4 b·min−1).
3.4 | Plasma glucose
The fasting plasma glucose concentration was 6.2 ± 0.7 and 
6.2 ± 0.8 mmol·L−1 in F+D and D at baseline and was low-
ered (P < .05) postintervention by 0.4 ± 0.7 mmol·L−1 in 
both groups (Figure 4). Plasma glucose during the OGTT was 
lower (P < .05) at all- 
time points postintervention compared to 
preintervention in F+D and D (Figure 4). At 60 and 120 min-
utes, the postintervention plasma glucose concentration was 
9.0 ± 2.7 and 5.7 ± 1.6 mmol·L−1 in F+D, which was lower 
(P < .05) than in D (10.6 ± 2.9 and 7.5 ± 2.4 mmol·L−1). 
Plasma glucose values were back at baseline after 120 min-
utes in F+D, but not in D (Figure 4). Preintervention tAUC 
was 1092 ± 281 and 1240 ± 230 mmol·min−1·L−1 in F+D 
and D, respectively, and was lowered (P < .05) to 957 ± 203 
and 1095 ± 221 mmol·min−1·L−1 postintervention with no 
difference in change score. However, postintervention tAUC 
was lower (P < .05) in F+D than in D.
3.5 | Blood lipid profile, C- 
reactive 
protein, and vitamin D
F+D showed a greater (P < .05) intervention- 
induced de-
crease (−0.5 ± 0.5 mmol·L−1) in total plasma cholesterol in 
comparison with D (0.0 ± 0.5 mmol·L−1; Table 2). Plasma 
LDL cholesterol was also lowered (−0.3 ± 0.5 mmol·L−1) 
in F+D only with a greater change score than D 
(+0.1 ± 0.4 mmol·L−1), while HDL was unchanged in both 
groups (Table 2). Plasma triglyceride concentrations were 
reduced (P < .05) in F+D (−0.2 ± 0.5 mmol·L−1) only with 
no between- 
group differences (Table 2). Plasma CRP and vi-
tamin D were unaltered during the intervention period in both 
groups (Table 2). Plasma CRP tended to decrease (P = .06) 
in D only (Table 2), while plasma vitamin D was unchanged 
in both groups during the intervention period (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
The present study is the first to examine the impact of foot-
ball training on 55- 
 to 70- 
year- 
old patients with prediabetes. 
The results demonstrate that 16 weeks of football training 
combined with dietary advice causes broad- 
spectrum posi-
tive effects on metabolic and cardiovascular health profile in 
individuals with prediabetes and that the effects are greater 
than professional dietary advice alone.
Patients with T2DM, prediabetes, or metabolic syndrome 
are more likely to have cardiovascular deficiencies than 
healthy individuals.6,9 In the present study, the participants

both groups showed a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure postintervention (Figure 2). However, the football 
group showed a drop in mean arterial pressure of 8 mm Hg, 
which was higher than the diet group, and which is on a com-
parable magnitude as conventional pharmacological agents 
used for blood pressure management. Indeed, the football 
training group was actually able to normalize systolic and di-
astolic blood pressure (127 and 77 mm Hg) in just 16 weeks. 
These findings are supported by other football training stud-
ies in hypertensive women.10 Small- 
sided football games 
have been shown to induce high cardiovascular loading,19 
which is confirmed by mean and peak heart rates of 80 and 
95% HRmax, respectively, in the present study. Moreover, the 
F+D group showed a markedly improved blood lipid pro-
file postintervention, with a decrease in total cholesterol of 
0.5 mmol·L−1 as well as a drop in plasma triglyceride con-
centration. These findings are confirmed by numerous other 
football training interventions in various women subject 
groups.9 Thus, football training in combination with dietary 
advice markedly improves cardiovascular health in 55- 
 to 
70- 
year- 
olds with prediabetes.
The 
F+D 
intervention 
induced 
an 
increase 
of 
~3.5 mL·min−1·kg−1 in maximal oxygen uptake, which is 
clinically significant.23 Low cardiorespiratory fitness is a 
common characteristic in patients with T2DM,10,24 and the 
baseline values of the participants with prediabetes in the 
present study confirm these findings. These participants 
were 55- 
 to 70- 
year- 
olds, and it is evident that physiological 
aging causes a decline in VO2max of 5%- 
10% per decade.25 
Thus, patients with prediabetes in this age group are likely 
to display low aerobic fitness values, which has an impact 
on their cardiorespiratory health. Consequently, the observed 
improvement in VO2max is highly important for this patient 
group, as patients with T2DM who increase their level of 
cardiorespiratory fitness of approximately 5 mL·kg−1·min−1 
have a significant reduction in overall cardiovascular mortal-
ity of 39%- 
70%.23,26 The 14% increase in VO2max is approxi-
mately at the same level or even higher than shown previously 
after football interventions lasting 12- 
52 weeks.8 In addition, 
a recent meta- 
analysis confirmed that football training is 
most likely largely beneficial (effect size=1.14) for increas-
ing VO2max and may be more efficient than other training 
methods such as running and strength training.27 Moreover, 
football training interventions demonstrate the same magni-
tude effects on VO2max as reported in meta- 
analysis of high- 
intensity interval training.28 Thus, football training appears 
to be a highly efficient training method for increasing the 
cardiorespiratory health status of patients with prediabetes.
In addition to the improved aerobic capacity, the football 
training intervention also increased cycling performance 
and lowered resting heart rate, despite that the latter change 
was not significantly different from the diet group. Physical 
performance and resting heart rate are both independent 
health markers.29 For example, a high resting heart rate is 
statistically related to increased risk of hypertension, vascular 
oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and accelerated ath-
erosclerosis,30 which further highlights the broad- 
spectrum 
health benefits of football training.
Another principal finding of the present study was that 
fasting plasma glucose concentrations declined from 6.2 
to 5.8 mmol·L−1 in both intervention groups, which means 
that the average values decline below the clinical thresh-
old of impaired blood glucose control. Moreover, tAUC in 
the OGTT was lowered postintervention, and collectively 
these results demonstrate clear improvements in blood glu-
cose regulation and an attenuation of the risk of develop-
ing T2DM with both interventions being beneficial for the 
respective patient group. Interestingly, the F+D interven-
tion group displayed lower postintervention plasma glu-
cose concentrations at 60 and 120 minutes of the OGTT 
and had a lower absolute tAUC compared to the D group, 
despite a similar change score in both groups. Hence, 
football training performed twice weekly as small- 
sided 
games for 16 weeks in conjunction with dietary advice 
may be slightly more effective than dietary advice alone. 
Indeed, postintervention the football group, in contrast to 
the diet group, was able to normalize the plasma glucose 
concentration to baseline values at the end of the OGTT 
(see Figure 4), which indicates a decreased risk of progres-
sion of diabetes.31 These findings are in accordance with a 
recent study applying a combined football and diet inter-
vention to patients with T2DM, which also demonstrated 
greater adaptations in glucose regulation than a calorie- 
restricted diet alone.10 However, it should be noted that it 
is a limitation in the present study that the intervention- 
induced effects on HbA1c and insulin were not measured, 
that the absolute tAUG values were nonsignificantly higher 
preintervention in D than F+D, and that no between- 
group 
effects were present.
An independent risk factor for insulin resistance and 
T2DM is obesity, and especially abdominal fat accumulation, 
which is also detrimental to cardiovascular homeostasis.32 In 
the present study, the football intervention induced a markedly 
greater fat loss (~3.5 kg) compared to dietary advice alone. In 
addition, waist circumference F+D was reduced more than 
twice as much in comparison with D. The large decrease in 
body fat content after 4 months of football training is in line 
with findings in sedentary men33 and women,8 as well as 
various female patient groups.9 In addition, cross- 
sectional 
studies in elderly football players show markedly lower body 
fat content than age- 
matched sedentary controls.34 Recently, 
we demonstrated that 15 weeks of football training in middle- 
aged sedentary hypertensive women upregulated skeletal 
muscle mitochondrial function and β- 
oxidative capacity,9 
which is also supported by increased whole- 
body fat oxida-
tion during exercise after a football training intervention.8 
    |

SKORADAL et AL.
Thus, it is plausible to suggest that increased muscle fat ox-
idative capacity contributed to the decrease in body fat con-
tent in the football group. Part of the pathology in T2DM is 
low skeletal muscle mitochondrial function.35
Type 2 diabetes is closely linked not only with obesity 
but also with low muscle mass,7 and a consistent finding in 
football training studies across the lifespan is an increase in 
muscle mass.8,16,36 Additionally, in the present study the F+D 
group had a ~1 kg increase in lean body mass compared to 
the D group. The higher muscle mass provides a larger po-
tential total muscle glycogen storage capacity, which is likely 
to improve clearance of glucose from the bloodstream.37 This 
adaptation may have added to the effect on postintervention 
glucose control in F+D.
The current exercise recommendation for patients with di-
abetes is at least 150 minutes per week of moderate- 
intensity 
aerobic physical activity combined with resistance training.5 
However, the present findings and other recent investigations 
indicate that high- 
intensity intermittent training may be essen-
tial for improving metabolic and cardiovascular health profile 
in sedentary populations15 as well as in individuals with10 or 
at risk of32 T2DM. As football represents a complex training 
method encompassing simultaneous endurance, high- 
intensity 
exercise and resistance training,8 this type of training modality 
may be well suited as an exercise training therapy for patients 
with prediabetes. In the study by de Sousa et al,10 the authors 
prescribed 12 weeks of football training (40 minutes 3 times 
per week) combined with a calorie- 
restricted diet for 48- 
 to 
68- 
year- 
old patients with T2DM. The combined intervention 
augmented insulin sensitivity more efficiently than dietary 
advice alone with concomitant increases in maximal oxygen 
uptake and improvement in blood lipid profile, as found in the 
current study of patients with prediabetes. The participants in 
the present study trained on average 60- 
120 minutes per week, 
which questions the above- 
mentioned 150 minutes per week 
recommendation for patients with prediabetes. Prevalence of 
T2DM increases with age,13 and a sedentary lifestyle is proven 
to be a valid predictor of mortality in patients with T2DM.14 
However, mortality risk can be attenuated by physical train-
ing in the aging population.7 The patient group in the present 
study was recruited from a cohort in the Faroe Islands where 
~10 and ~15% of the population between 40 and 79 years had 
T2DM and prediabetes, respectively (Veyhe et al, personal 
communication) Type 2 diabetes is a major worldwide health 
challenge, causing considerable morbidity and mortality,1,2 
and is imposing a significant economic burden on the health-
care system. Thus, treating patients with prediabetes with 
lifestyle changes, such as the combination of football training 
and diet alterations, may offer excellent prospects and may be 
integrated into the “Exercise as Medicine” concept.7 The fact 
that no serious injuries occurred as result of the football train-
ing in a fragile group with low physical capacity supports this 
notion.
A limitation in the present study is that we did not monitor 
the impact of the diet advice on the eating habits during the 
intervention period. Therefore, it is not possible to evaluate 
to what degree the participants followed the recommenda-
tions. However, both groups received the diet advice, which 
may limit potential bias of the applied approach. In addition, 
we did not perform any assessment of the daily activity level 
of the participants, which may have affected the results. 
However, none of the participants took part in regular physi-
cal training prior or during the intervention period.
In conclusion, 16 weeks of football training combined 
with dietary advice have broad- 
spectrum effects on meta-
bolic and cardiovascular health profile for 55- 
 to 70- 
year- 
old 
men and women with prediabetes, with greater overall effects 
than professional dietary advice per se.

PERSPECTIVES
Individuals suffering from prediabetes usually have broad- 
spectrum pathophysiological challenges such as poor 
cardiovascular health, obesity, low muscle mass, and cardi-
orespiratory fitness, and the observed broad- 
spectrum health 
effects of football training are therefore highly relevant for 
this patient group. The results of the present study are with 
line with other recent studies using small- 
sided football train-
ing, emphasizing that just 2 hours of training per week in 
combination with dietary advice seems to be a feasible and 
efficient approach to improve the overall fitness level and 
health profile of untrained female and male patients across 
the lifespan. In the present study, elderly women and men 
trained together, and the positive fitness and health adapta-
tions occurred independently of skill level and gender, dem-
onstrating that mixed- 
gender football training can be applied 
as treatment for patients with prediabetes, which may have 
some socio- 
psychological benefits.
