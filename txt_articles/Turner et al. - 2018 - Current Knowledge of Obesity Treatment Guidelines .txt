 Current Knowledge of Obesity Treatment Guidelines
by Health Care Professionals
Monique Turner, Nichole Jannah
, Scott Kahan, Christine Gallagher, and William Dietz
Objective: The objective of this study was to assess health care professionals’ knowledge of evidence-
based guidelines for the nonsurgical treatment of obesity.
Methods: A nationally representative sample of internists, family practitioners, obstetricians/gynecologists,
and nurse practitioners completed a web-based survey between June 9 and July 1, 2016 (n 5 1,506).
Results: Only 16% of respondents indicated that obesity counseling should be provided approximately
twice monthly in an individual or group setting for at least 6 months, in accordance with United States
Preventive Services Task Force and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidelines. Only 15% of
respondents identified BMI � 27 kg/m2 with an obesity-associated comorbid condition as the appropriate
indication to prescribe pharmacotherapy for patients. Two-thirds of respondents indicated that it is
appropriate to continue long-term pharmacotherapy under conditions inconsistent with evidence-based
guidelines, with nearly one-quarter indicating that obesity medications should never be prescribed
beyond 3 months regardless of weight loss.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that provider understanding of appropriate clinical care for obesity
is inconsistent with evidence-based recommendations. As coverage for behavioral counseling services
and pharmacotherapy expands, it is imperative that health care professionals understand how to effec-
tively leverage these treatment modalities to optimize health outcomes for patients with obesity.

Introduction
Adults with obesity (BMI� 30 kg/m2) incur 42% higher medical costs
per capita and are nearly two times more likely to die before age 70 than
adults with a healthy weight (1,2). Health care providers (HCPs) play a
vital role in the prevention, treatment, and control of obesity. Evidence
suggests
that
multicomponent
behavioral
interventions
(intensive
behavioral therapy [IBT]), pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery are all
effective strategies that support clinically significant weight loss (�5%
reduction in body weight) for persons with obesity (3,4). Yet application
of these evidence-based treatments is uncommon (5,6). Rates of IBT
actually declined slightly between 1995 and 2008, despite the steady rise
in obesity prevalence during this period, and remain low at present (7,8).
A previous survey found that 97% of HCPs believed they were
partly or solely responsible for ensuring that patients were counseled
on obesity (9). Persistently low rates of counseling are at odds with
providers’ self-proclaimed sense of responsibility for addressing obe-
sity, suggesting that additional factors deter HCPs from addressing
weight with their patients. HCPs have cited lack of time, limited
reimbursement, and lack of training as major barriers that prevent
them from addressing obesity with their patients (9). When asked
what would lead them to bring up obesity in conversation, 68% of
HCPs indicated that an obesity-related risk factor would prompt dis-
cussion, while 57% indicated that they would wait for the patient to
broach the topic.
Beyond behavioral counseling, recent data suggest that HCPs vary
widely in their provision of pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery
for patients with obesity. In a survey of US providers, Petrin et al.
(10) found that 31% of HCPs would not prescribe pharmacotherapy
for obesity under any circumstances, with men and underweight pro-
viders more likely than women and providers at a healthy weight to
indicate pharmacotherapy was an acceptable treatment modality.
While 89% of HCPs were willing to refer patients for bariatric sur-
gery, assuming no contraindications, less than one-third would refer
at
the
guideline-recommended
BMI
threshold
(BMI � 40
or
BMI � 35 with a comorbid condition). Delayed or absent referrals

Obesity
 impair access to evidence-based bariatric procedures, which may be
the most effective treatment for patients with severe obesity who are
not able to achieve or maintain substantial weight loss through non-
surgical interventions (11).
Although Petrin et al. (9,10) provided information on obesity-related
attitudes and treatment practices across provider types, the predictors
of such attitudes and practices remain unclear. One possible expla-
nation is that HCPs lack adequate knowledge of the current guide-
lines for clinical obesity management. Thus, we are making a criti-
cal distinction between attitudes (and beliefs) and knowledge levels.
Whereas attitudes and beliefs about what constitutes appropriate
obesity management are subjectively held constructs based in culture
and norms, knowledge is a more objective measure of a provider’s
theoretical or practical understanding of the topic derived from
didactic education. In this study, we assessed knowledge of nonsur-
gical obesity treatment guidelines among family practitioners (FPs),
internists, obstetricians/gynecologists (OB-GYNs), and nurse practi-
tioners (NPs) (3,4,12).
Methods
Data were collected in June 2016 using DocStyles, a web-based survey
administered to a panel of 1,506 verified HCPs. In concert with Porter
Novelli, a public relations firm specializing in health and social market-
ing, we designed obesity-specific questions for inclusion in the survey.
The national sample used for analysis was randomly drawn from SER-
MO’S Global Medical Panel, which includes more than 330,000 medi-
cal professionals in the United States. The sample included 1,003 pri-
mary care physicians (480 FPs and 523 internists), 250 OB-GYNs, and
253 NPs. Participants were screened to include only those who practice
in the United States, actively see adult patients, and have been practic-
ing for at least 3 years. HCPs serving only pediatric patients were

 excluded from participation. Respondents were paid an honorarium of
$21 to $90 upon completion of the survey.
The full DocStyles panel contained 144 questions designed to provide
insight into HCPs’ attitudes and counseling behaviors on a variety of
health issues. The present analysis examined responses to five ques-
tions designed to assess participants’ understanding of obesity treat-
ment guidelines in the context of various HCP characteristics (gender,
race, age, height, weight, type and practice setting, average income of
patients served, and years in practice). Self-reported height and weight
data were used to calculate each respondent’s BMI. Participants were
asked questions to assess their knowledge of guidelines regarding the
recommended minimum level of physical activity, the recommended
duration and intensity of weight loss counseling, appropriate eating
patterns for weight loss, the appropriate threshold to prescribe weight
loss medications, and when it is appropriate to prescribe weight loss
medications long term (Table 1).
v2 tests, odds ratios (OR), and generalized linear models were used to
assess differences in provider responses by specialty, BMI, gender,
years in practice, and typical household income of patients seen.
Results
The overall response rate for the survey was 64.5%. Table 1 summa-
rizes respondent demographic characteristics. After controlling for
demographic variables (e.g., age, patient volume, practice setting),
HCP knowledge of clinical guidelines for physical activity, behavioral
counseling, and pharmacotherapy varied significantly by provider
type and years in practice (Table 2). Overall, HCPs were most knowl-
edgeable of the physical activity guidelines (49% correct). HCPs were
least likely to identify evidence-based guidelines when selecting the
recommended intensity of obesity counseling (15% correct).
Only two providers (0.1%) selected responses consistent with
evidence-based recommendations from all five guidelines assessed
by the survey. Most participants (84%) failed to identify practices
consistent with evidence-based obesity treatment guidelines for the
majority of questions (�3 incorrect). The average number of
guideline-aligned responses varied significantly by provider type and
was highest among FPs (M 5 1.65, 95% CI: 1.53-1.77) and lowest
among internists (M 5 1.40, 95% CI: 1.28-1.51) after controlling for
years in practice. FPs were significantly more likely than internists,
NPs, and OB-GYNs to identify the correct guidelines for obesity
counseling and pharmacotherapy (Figure 1).

 recommended for weight loss (4). When data were stratified by pro-
vider type, responses varied significantly by BMI category for NPs,
OB-GYNs, and internists. NPs with a healthy weight were four times
more likely than NPs with obesity to indicate that any eating pattern
can be recommended for weight loss (OR 5 4.30, 95% CI: 1.41-
13.10). Internists with obesity were four times more likely than intern-
ists at a healthy weight to indicate that dieting results in weight regain
and should not be used (OR 5 4.35, 95% CI: 1.01-20.00).
Intensive behavioral therapy
Fewer than 20% of providers recommended the counseling option
consistent with United States Preventive Services Task Force guide-
lines (3). FPs (19%) and NPs (17%) were most likely to identify the
correct counseling guideline. Among respondents who selected
incorrectly, NPs were significantly more likely than FPs to select
options that specified counseling provided by a dietician (OR 5 2.08,
95% CI: 1.54-2.86) (Supporting Information Table S1). Collectively,
physicians (14%) were significantly more likely than NPs (5%) to
indicate that no counseling option is recommended for patients with
obesity (OR 5 3.06, 95% CI: 1.71-5.46). Responses varied signifi-
cantly by years in practice and patient volume (Figure 2).
Physical activity
About half (49%) of providers correctly identified that 150 minutes
of moderate-intensity physical activity per week is the guideline-
recommended minimum level of physical activity to achieve sub-
stantial health benefits (13). NPs (53%) and FPs (52%) were most
likely to identify the correct guideline, but responses did not vary
significantly by provider type. Of providers identifying an incorrect
guideline, 25% selected a level of physical activity higher than the
recommended minimum (e.g., longer duration, higher intensity), and
20% selected a level lower than the recommended minimum (e.g.
shorter duration).
Pharmacotherapy for obesity
Only 8% of HCPs correctly identified the guideline-recommended
thresholds to initiate and continue pharmacotherapy for obesity (Fig-
ure 3) (12). Seventy-seven percent of HCPs selected a prescribing
threshold higher than recommended for patients with an obesity-
associated comorbidity, and 26% indicated long-term pharmacother-
apy only for patients achieving at least 10% to 15% reduction in body
weight. FPs (19%) and internists (16%) were significantly more likely
than NPs and OB-GYNs to identify prescribing practices consistent
with evidence-based guidelines (OR 5 2.25, 95% CI: 1.59-3.19).
While only 4% of HCPs in this study indicated that obesity medica-
tions should never be prescribed, one in five respondents indicated
that long-term pharmacotherapy is unsafe.
Discussion
This study is the first from a large, randomly selected sample of
active HCPs to confirm that 1) HCP knowledge of physical activity
and dietary guidelines is limited and 2) HCP understanding of the
appropriate initiation, intensity, and duration for provision of IBT
and pharmacotherapy is often inconsistent with evidence-based
guidelines. These results complement findings from previous analy-
ses of HCP self-reported behaviors (5,14), particularly prescribing
behavior for obesity pharmacotherapy (Table 3). Our findings indi-
cate that significant gaps in HCP knowledge of evidence-based
guidelines for obesity management may underlie low rates (15) of
IBT and pharmacotherapy for patients with obesity.
Unlike previous surveys (5,7,9,10,16,17), the questions used in this
analysis were designed to assess HCP knowledge of various

ied significantly by years in practice (**P � 0.01) and patient volume (*P � 0.05); adjusted means (Madj) were
obtained from analysis of covariance, controlling for age, gender, practice setting, practice size, and typical
income of patients seen. Providers with fewer years in practice and a lower patient volume were most likely
to correctly identify the guideline-recommended counseling option as twice-monthly individual or group coun-
seling for at least 6 months (3,4).

 evidence-based obesity treatment guidelines rather than their atti-
tudes or behaviors. Because knowledge of obesity management is
not routinely assessed by medical licensing exams (18), this analysis
provides unique information on where knowledge is most lacking
and how understanding of IBT and pharmacotherapy guidelines dif-
fers for FPs, internists, OB-GYNs, and NPs. As an assessment of
current HCP knowledge, our findings fill an important evidence gap
in recent efforts to explain why widespread provider beliefs about
the importance of addressing obesity (9) seldom translate into provi-
sion of evidence-based treatments in clinical practice (10).
Differences in baseline training in obesity management and postgradu-
ate clinical experiences may account for some of the observed varia-
tion in knowledge across provider groups. Unfortunately, comparable
national data on profession- and specialty-specific training require-
ments for obesity management are scarce (6,19). The greater

 knowledge of obesity treatment guidelines demonstrated by FPs rela-
tive to internists and OB-GYNs in this analysis aligns well with a
recent study of Ohio residency programs that found FPs received sig-
nificantly more hours of didactic training related to obesity, physical
activity, and nutrition than internists or OB-GYNs (20). Supporting
the link between poor understanding of evidence-based guidelines and
clinical practice, a national review of patient encounters found that
OB-GYNs were the main source of preventive care for more than one-
third of nonpregnant women, but they were less likely than FPs to pro-
vide obesity counseling (21) and seldom prescribed pharmacotherapy
(22). Similarly low rates of pharmacotherapy were reported by NPs
(9), although this is partly explained by inconsistent scope of practice
laws governing prescriptive authority at the state level.
Importantly, previous DocStyles analyses have found that both OB-
GYNs and NPs were significantly more likely than FPs and internists to
indicate that additional training in obesity management would improve
their ability to counsel patients with obesity (9,10). Although results from
the present analysis suggest that all provider types will benefit from
enhanced graduate and postgraduate learning opportunities in obesity
management, the additional training may be particularly well received by
OB-GYNs and NPs, who are increasingly called upon to deliver compre-
hensive primary care services for US adults. Furthermore, system-wide
changes in education and reimbursement policy over the past several dec-
ades may explain some of the within-group response variation observed
by years in practice. For example, the recent expansion of Medicare
reimbursement for IBT (23) may partly explain why providers who
entered practice within the past 10 years were more likely to recommend
the IBT option consistent with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Serv-
ices guidelines.
It is also possible that individual differences in weight bias contributed to
the substantial within-group response variation in this analysis. Weight
bias can be both a mediator and product of inadequate knowledge and
training on obesity (24), making its effects particularly difficult to parse
(25). Our finding that one-third of HCPs would delay pharmacotherapy
until BMI� 35, even in the presence of a comorbid condition, might be
evidence that many HCPs still perceive obesity as a disease of willpower
that can be ameliorated simply by eating less and exercising more—an
antiquated mantra rooted in weight bias. Yet HCPs who recommended
initiation of pharmacotherapy at BMI� 35 were also four times more
likely than HCPs who recommended initiation at BMI� 27 to indicate
that FDA-approved medications for obesity are unsafe for long-term use.
Together, these findings suggest that weight bias and misinformation
about the safety and efficacy of obesity medications approved for long-
term use may work synergistically to deter HCPs from utilizing effective
pharmacotherapies in accordance with evidence-based guidelines (12).
Limitations
Although this analysis includes responses from a large, nationally rep-
resentative sample of active US HCPs, it has several limitations. The
survey did not capture responses from several important provider
types, including physician assistants, and the findings may not be gen-
eralizable to all US HCPs. Although participants were randomly
selected, inclusion in the SERMO medical panel from which partici-
pants were drawn is inherently prone to selection bias. Based on
unpublished demographic data from previously conducted surveys, it
is also possible that a small number of respondents included in this
analysis had prior specialty training in obesity management. While we
did not assess the number or distribution of obesity specialists across
HCP groups, a concentration of obesity specialists within subsamples
could explain some of the intergroup variation in responses. Further-
more, the DocStyles survey instrument has not been formally tested
for reliability or validity. Any psychometric assessment is subject to
nonsampling errors, including specification error, measurement error,
and random response error. Although questions and answer choices
were designed to minimize response bias, we did not control for differ-
ential interpretations of questions or other sources of error that may
have influenced responses. Thus, it is possible that the results do not
accurately reflect knowledge of obesity treatment guidelines for some
respondents.
Implications
Our findings offer insight on HCPs’ familiarity with the clinical guide-
lines for provision of evidence-based obesity treatment modalities, but
the survey did not directly assess the effect of provider knowledge on
provision of counseling and pharmacotherapy services. Assuming
HCPs provide treatment according to their knowledge of evidence-
based guidelines, our data suggest that HCPs are waiting too long to
initiate treatment and maintaining unrealistic outcome expectations
for initial weight loss when they do. Additional research is needed to
clarify the extent to which improving HCP knowledge of clinical
guidelines for obesity management will improve quality of care and
population health outcomes. Furthermore, the impact of pervasive
weight stigma on HCP understanding of ideal approaches to obesity
management should not be discounted when considering systematic
drivers of suboptimal or absent obesity care.
Implementation of the recently released HCP competencies for the
prevention and treatment of obesity (26), tools to facilitate improved
clinical decision-making, and standardized reimbursement policies
could bolster HCPs’ self-efficacy and increase provision of effective
services that improve health outcomes for patients with obesity (27).
Given the multitude of distinct but overlapping obesity management
guidelines currently in existence (4,12,28), synthesis of a practical,
unified standard of care may help knowledgeable HCPs to success-
fully implement evidence-based obesity care in a variety of settings.
Conclusion
These findings indicate that HCP understanding of appropriate clini-
cal care for obesity is inconsistent with evidence-based recommen-
dations. Our data suggest that limited understanding of when and
how to deliver evidence-based treatments likely deters HCPs from
addressing obesity with their patients. As coverage for behavioral
counseling services and pharmacotherapy expands, it is imperative
that health professional training programs better prepare HCPs to
leverage evidence-based treatment modalities that can optimize
health outcomes for patients with obesity.O
