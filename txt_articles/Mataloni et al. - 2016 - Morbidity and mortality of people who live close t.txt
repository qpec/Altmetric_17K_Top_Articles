Abstract
Background: The evidence on the health effects related to residing close to landfills is
controversial. Nine landfills for municipal waste have been operating in the Lazio region
(Central Italy) for several decades. We evaluated the potential health effects associated
with contamination from landfills using the estimated concentration of hydrogen sul-
phide (H2S) as exposure.
Methods: A cohort of residents within 5 km of landfills was enrolled (subjects resident on
1 January 1996 and those who subsequently moved into the areas until 2008) and fol-
lowed for mortality and hospitalizations until 31 December 2012. Assessment of expos-
ure to the landfill (H2S as a tracer) was performed for each subject at enrolment, using a
Lagrangian dispersion model. Information on several confounders was available (gen-
der, age, socioeconomic position, outdoor PM10 concentration, and distance from busy
roads and industries). Cox regression analysis was performed [Hazard Ratios (HRs), 95%
confidence intervals (CIs)].
Results: The cohort included 242 409 individuals. H2S exposure was associated with
mortality from lung cancer and respiratory diseases (e.g. HR for increment of 1 ng/m3
H2S: 1.10, 95% CI 1.02–1.19; HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00–1.19, respectively). There were also as-
sociations between H2S and hospitalization for respiratory diseases (HR ¼ 1.02, 95% CI
1.00–1.03),
especially
acute
respiratory
infections
among
children
(0–14
years)
(HR ¼ 1.06, 95% CI 1.02–1.11).
Conclusions: Exposure to H2S, a tracer of airborne contamination from landfills, was
associated with lung cancer mortality as well as with mortality and morbidity for respira-
tory diseases. The link with respiratory disease is plausible and coherent with previous
studies, whereas the association with lung cancer deserves confirmation.

 Introduction
People who live close to municipal solid waste (MSW) land-
fills could be exposed to air pollutants emitted by the plants
(landfill gas containing methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen
sulphide and other contaminants including volatile organic
compounds, particulate matter and bioaresols) or to contami-
nated soil and water. The possible health effects related to
residence close to these sites have been assessed in several ori-
ginal papers1–9 and evaluated in systematic reviews.10,11
Excess of mortality for some cancer sites (e.g. liver, pancreas,
kidney, larynx) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been noted
in some studies,1–3 but the results have not been confirmed in
other investigations.4–6 In addition, some studies have indi-
cated an increase of respiratory symptoms among residents
close to biodegradable waste facilities.12 In 2009, Porta et
al.10 concluded that evidence of an association between living
close to a landfill and adverse health effects is inconclusive.
Most of the published studies have methodological problems,
including poor exposure assessment based only on distance
from the source, use of health data at the aggregate level and
limited possibility of adjusting for socioeconomic status. The
quality of the epidemiological studies and scientific know-
ledge about the issue would be improved by using a residen-
tial cohort approach13 and applying dispersion models to
provide a better exposure assessment.14
This study aimed at evaluating the association between esti-
mated exposure to hydrogen sulphide (H2S, produced by an-
aerobic decomposition of sulphur-containing organic matter
in landfills) and mortality and morbidity of a cohort of resi-
dents living within 5km of the nine MSW landfills of the
Lazio region (Central Italy, about 5 million inhabitants includ-
ing the city of Rome). The study was part of a larger project
on the characteristics of municipal solid waste treatment
plants, their emissions and potential health effects in Lazio
(www.eraslazio.it).
Methods
Study areas
Nine municipal solid waste landfills have been operating in
Lazio for several decades. Only in the past two decades
they were equipped with containments (including leachate
collection and treatment, landfill cap construction and
landfill gas collection and treatment). The main character-
istics of the landfills (together with other potentially rele-
vant environmental factors in the areas, e.g. arsenic
contamination)14 are described in Supplementary Table 1,
Landfill characteristics, and in Supplementary Figure 2,
Study areas, (available as Supplementary data at IJE on-
line). The study area was defined for each landfill as a 5-
km radius from the boundary of the landfills assessed using
GIS software and regional technical maps with a scale of
1:5000. The World Geodetic System of 1984, with the
Universal Transverse Mercator zone 33Nord projection
(WGS84_UTM33N) was the reference for the geographical
coordinates.
Exposure assessment
H2S has been considered a surrogate measure of all con-
taminants emitted by landfills, and the airborne concentra-
tions were predicted using a dispersion model. Dispersion
models, such as the one we have been using here, have
been recently used to assess the health effects of waste
management processes.15–17 We followed a process in
three steps. First, yearly H2S emissions from each sector of
the landfills were estimated using a Landfill Gas Emissions
Model.18 Using several variables (the start and end dates of
operations for each sector of the landfills, the waste cap-
acity and waste acceptance rate), the annual emission rates
for H2S were calculated by means of a first-order decom-
position rate equation:
QH2S ¼

where:

t ¼ age of the jth section of the landfill
i ¼ 1 year time increment
n ¼ (year of the calculation) – (initial year of waste
acceptance)
Key Messages
• The evidence on the health of people living close to landfills is still controversial; most of the published studies are
characterized by poor exposure assessment, use of health data at the aggregate level and limited possibility of adjust-
ing for socioeconomic status.
• We evaluated the potential health effect of living near nine landfills (Lazio region, Italy), using a residential cohort ap-
proach and a dispersion model for exposure assessment.
• Exposure to landfills was associated with mortality from lung cancer and respiratory diseases and with hospitaliza-
tions for respiratory diseases, both in adults and in children.

 j ¼ 0.1 year time increment
K ¼ hydrogen sulphide generation rate (year-1)
Lo ¼ potential hydrogen sulphide generation capacity
(m3/Mg)
Mt ¼ mass of waste accepted until t (in Mg)
tij ¼ age of the waste mass accepted until the ith year
(Mt) at the jth section
Mg ¼ Megagram.
We used inventory defaults parameters derived from the
US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Compilation
of Air Pollutant Emission Factors19 to define hydrogen sul-
phide generation rate (K) and potential hydrogen sulphide
generation capacity (Lo), and Mt and tij were defined by
the Lazio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) using
local data. Second, the EMMA software was used for the
temporal and spatial modulation of the estimated emis-
sions. EMMA approximates landfills shape as a regular
grid with a resolution of 125 m x 125 m.20 Finally, we
used
a
Lagrangian
particle
model
(SPRAY
ver.5,
ARIANET Srl, Italy) to simulate H2S concentrations
around the landfills and to produce maps of annual aver-
age concentrations around the sites; 2008 was chosen as
the reference year for all the sites. The meteorological data
were derived from regional measurements made by Lazio
EPA in 2005 (that year is considered representative of the
meteorological conditions in the area), and used in connec-
tion with RAMS data.21 The Lagrangian model simulates
the transport, dispersion and deposition of pollutants emit-
ted using the orography, the meteorological data, the tur-
bulence and the hourly spatial distribution (horizontal and
vertical) of the emissions, based on the characteristics of
the single source and on the mass fluxes. The model fol-
lows the path of fictitious particles in the atmospheric tur-
bulent flow, and it is able to take into account complex
situations, such as the presence of obstacles, breeze cycles,
strong meteorological non-homogeneities and non-station-
ary, calm wind conditions.
Each subject in the cohort (see below) was assigned an
H2S exposure value corresponding to the estimated annual
average value from the dispersion model at the baseline ad-
dress. In other words, no exposure variation over time was
considered and each person remained at the same exposure
level during the all study period.
Enrolment of the cohort and follow-up procedures
All residents living within 5 km of the borders of the land-
fill on 1 January 1996, or those who later moved to the
areas until 31 December 2008, were enrolled; datasets
from 16 municipalities were used. Vital status was assessed
using
local
registries
until
31
December
2012.
We
considered subjects at risk until they died or moved out of
the municipality.
Health outcomes
We analysed natural and cause-specific mortality and hos-
pital admissions for cardiorespiratory diseases. The under-
lying cause of death for deceased subjects was retrieved
from the Regional Registry of Causes of Death, and hos-
pital admissions were obtained from the Regional Hospital
Information System which collects information related to
all hospital admissions that occur each year in public and
private hospitals. Causes of death and diagnoses of hospi-
talization were coded according to the ICD 9 revision. For
each subject, only the principal diagnosis that was the rea-
son for the hospitalization was used and the event (i.e. fail-
ure in the Cox model) was defined at the time of the first
hospitalization for a specific cause that occurred in the
study period. Respiratory hospital admissions for children
(residents under 14 years) were also analysed.
Covariates
We considered for each subject an area-based socioeco-
nomic position (SEP) index, based on several characteris-
tics at the census tract level (around 400 inhabitants) such
as education level, occupation, housing conditions, family
size and country of origin, classified into five levels (high,
middle-high, medium, middle-low, low).22 Modelled out-
door PM10 concentrations (mg/m3) from primary emissions
were assigned to the residential addresses of the cohort
participants as a measure of background air quality.23 The
dispersion model was based on the integration between the
meteorological Regional Atmospheric Modelling System 21
and the Eulerian Flexible Air Quality Regional Model
(FARM, ARIANET Srl, Italy). As an additional indicator
of long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution at the
baseline address, we used the Functional Road Class (FRC)
(included in the TeleAtlasMultiNet road network) to clas-
sify the type of street: motorway (FRC ¼ 0) and major traf-
fic roads (FRC ¼ 1–5). Presence of an industrial plant in
the 2-km buffer from the residence was also considered.
Information
on
individual
lifestyle
factors
was
not
available.
Statistical analysis
The association between landfill H2S exposure and mortal-
ity and hospital admissions was evaluated using Cox pro-
portional hazard regression models [hazard ratios (HRs),
95% confidence intervals (CIs)], with age as the underlying
time variable.

 For mortality we defined a latency period of 5 years;
therefore we considered all cohort participants who were
residents of the area on 1 January 1996 (and started the
follow-up on 1 January 2001) and those who subsequently
moved to the areaup until 31 December 2003 (starting the
follow-up 5 years after enrolment). No latency was allowed
for the analyses of cardiorespiratory hospitalizations. We
first compared the mortality and hospitalization risk of
residents according to quartiles of the H2S distribution. We
then considered H2S as a continuous variable, using the
value of the annual mean exposure at residence. A linear as-
sociation was estimated for increments equal to 1 ng/m3 of
H2S. We considered as potential confounders socioeco-
nomic position (SEP), PM10 background concentrations,
residence within 150 m of main roads, 500 m from high-
ways and within 1 or 2 km of industrial plants. With the ex-
ception of PM10, which was a continuous variable, all
other covariates were considered in the model as categor-
ical variables. In addition, the analyses were performed
stratifying in the Cox analysis by landfill sites, to take into
account the possible different background rates in the vari-
ous local areas, by gender and by calendar period (1996–
2000, 2001–04, 2005–08, 2009–12), to take into account
possible time-related changes in background rates of mor-
tality and hospitalization. Diagnostic tools were used to
check the proportional-hazard assumption for all categor-
ical covariates. If any variable in the individual cohort
models violated this assumption, effect estimates were com-
pared with a stratified Cox analysis for that covariate. SAS
(SAS Institute, NC) and STATA ver. 12 (StataCorp, TX)
software programs were used for the statistical analyses.
Results
A total of 242 409 individuals were enrolled in the cohort
from 1996 to 2008 (50.4% females), and H2S concentra-
tions were estimated for each of them at the address of re-
cruitment. The annual average H2S exposure levels of the
population was rather low, 6.3 ng/m3 [standard deviation
(SD) 22.5]; as expected, people living close to the larger
landfills (Latina and Rome) had higher H2S exposure levels
[mean ¼ 32.7 ng/m3 (SD 76.3) and mean ¼ 45.8 ng/m3
(SD 59), respectively].
The main characteristics of the study cohort according
to H2S concentrations (divided by quartiles of exposure)
are described in Table 1. The distribution of gender, age
and vital status was rather similar across exposure catego-
ries. However, people living in areas with higher concen-
trations of H2S were more likely to be of lower SEP
compared with people living in areas with lower exposure.
PM10 background concentrations were higher in the most
exposed group compared with those in the low exposure
category. People in the higher exposure category tended to
live farther from high traffic roads (500 m) but closer to
highways and industrial plants (0–1 km). There was a good
correlation
between
distance
from
landfill
and
H2S
exposure.
At the end of the follow-up there were 18 609 deaths
(7.7%), and for 40 740 subjects (16.8%) the follow-up
ended at the time of move away from the municipality of
residence.
Table 2 shows the association between H2S concentra-
tions and cause-specific mortality; effect estimates are given
for the quartile distribution of H2S (25–50, 50 75 and >
75 percentile of the distribution vs < 25 percentile) and for
a linear increase of H2S equal to 1 ng/m3. There were asso-
ciations between H2S exposure and lung cancer (HR 1.34,
95% CI 1.06–1.71), and respiratory diseases (HR 1.30,
95% CI 0.99–1.70) when comparing residents in areas
with H2S concentrations greater than 75 percentiles to the
reference group. These findings were confirmed when we
consider H2S exposure as linear (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02–
1.19 for lung cancer and HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00–1.19 for
respiratory diseases). No other associations were noted.
Table 3 shows the results for cardiorespiratory hospital
admissions. No association was detected for cardiovascu-
lar diseases. There was an association between the highest
quartile of exposure to H2S and hospitalizations for re-
spiratory diseases (H 1.05, 95% CI 0.99–1.11) also when
considering H2S exposure as linear (HR 1.02, 95% CI
1.00–1.03). H2S exposure was linked with respiratory dis-
eases and acute respiratory infection hospital admissions
among children (for the highest quartile, HR 1.11, 95% CI
1.01–1.22; HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04–1.38, respectively) also
when we considered H2S exposure as a linear term in the
model. We found an association with paediatric admis-
sions for asthma but with wider confidence intervals.In
both mortality and hospitalization analyses, we did not
find effect modification by gender (data not shown).
Because of the peculiarity of the urban site in Rome
(‘Malagrotta’) (where a large landfill, an incinerator of
medical wastes, and a petrochemical refinery are located
within just a few kilometres of each other3), we repeated
the analyses excluding the subjects who live close to the
Malagrotta landfill. There were no important changes in
the results (See Supplementary Tables 3 ‘Mortality exclud-
ing Malagrotta landfill’ and 4 ‘Morbidity excluding
Malagrotta landfill’, available as Supplementary data at
IJE online). We did perform the same sensitivity analysis
excluding each landfill at the time, and again the results
were similar (see Supplementary Figures 7 ‘Lung cancer
mortality’, 8 ‘Respiratory mortality’, 9 ‘Respiratory mor-
bidity’ and 10 ‘Respiratory morbidity in children’, avail-
able as Supplementary data at IJE online).

 An additional analysis was performed using distance
from the landfills (0–2 km, 2–3 km vs 3–5 km), instead of
estimated H2S concentration, as the exposure variable.
Although the results for mortality using distance were not
similar to what has been observed using H2S concentra-
tions (see Supplementary Table 5 ‘Mortality by distance’,
available as Supplementary data at IJE online) the results
for hospitalizations were similar to those obtained using
H2S
concentrations
(see
Supplementary
Table
6
‘Morbidity by distance’, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online).
Our final concern was that migration outside the areas
could bias the results in the case of migration being associ-
ated with the exposure and if residents with pre-existing
diseases were more likely to migrate. We compared the
characteristics of people who migrated outside the study

 areas (40 740 subjects) with those who remained in the
areas until the end of the follow-up (201 669 subjects) See
Supplementary Table 11 ‘Comparison between migrant
and not migrant’, available as Supplementary data at IJE
online). We considered gender, age, socioeconomic status
and H2S exposure as fixed variables. Since occurrence of
hospitalizations before migration is a time-dependent vari-
able, we compared subjects migrating in the period 2004–
12 (19 695 subjects) with all subjects who did not migrate
before that period (189 560 subjects), evaluating the occur-
rence of cardiorespiratory hospitalizations during1998–
2003. Migration was associated with male gender, younger
age and lower exposure to H2S; no clear differences of mi-
grants compared with non-migrants were found for socioe-
conomic status. In a multinomial logistic regression(data
not shown), we found no major differences between the
two groups for respiratory diseases, whereas migrants
were less likely than non-migrants to suffer from two or
more hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease (OR, 0.
74, 95% CI 0.57–0.95) before migrating. All these results
indicate that bias due to increased susceptibility of mi-
grants is unlikely given that migrants are less exposed and
tend to be healthier than non-migrants.
Discussion
We found a positive association between exposure to
hydrogen sulphide (H2S), that we used as a surrogate for
all the pollutants co-emitted from the landfills, and mortal-
ity for lung cancer and respiratory diseases as well as hos-
pital admissions for respiratory diseases, especially in
children.
Previous studies have investigated the association between
residence close to landfills and cancer incidence or cause-spe-
cific mortality, with conflicting results. A Canadian cohort
study compared cancer incidence in males living close to a
landfill with that of residents of farther away areas.1 The dis-
tance from the landfill was assigned to each person based on
the residential address at diagnosis. Excess risks for non-
Hodgkin lymphoma and liver, pancreas and kidney cancers
were found in male residents close to the site. Malagrotta
(Rome) residents who lived near (in an area about 2 km2) a
large landfill of municipal solid waste, an incinerator and a
petrochemical refinery showed an association between prox-
imity to landfill and laryngeal cancer.2 A more recent resi-
dential cohort study of the same area found that H2S
exposure from the landfill was related to higher risk of mor-
tality from laryngeal cancer and bladder cancer in women, as
well as hospitalizations for cardiorespiratory diseases.3 Jarup
et al. compared cancer incidence (bladder, brain and hepato-
biliary cancers and leukaemias) in the population resident
within 2 km of 9565 landfills in UK with cancer rates of

 those who lived more than 2 km away.4 Despite the large
statistical power, the study did not show excess cancer risk
associated with proximity to landfill sites. An ecological
study compared mortality, hospital admissions and repro-
ductive health of a population living near a landfill site in
Wales with another population matched for socioeconomic
status.5 No differences between the two populations were
found. A study in Brazil evaluated the association between
residence close to solid waste landfill sites and cancer mortal-
ity.6 The exposed areas were defined using a 2-km buffer ra-
dius around 15 sites. Standardized mortality ratios were
analysed in Bayesian spatial models. The results did not indi-
cate any excess risk for people close to landfills. Some ele-
vated risks of bladder and liver cancer, and death due to
congenital malformation were found, although they did not
have statistical significance.
The results we found regarding respiratory diseases are
consistent with others suggesting a relationship between
living close to landfill areas and damage to the respiratory
system,24,25 as highlighted in a recent systematic review.26
Occurrence of respiratory symptoms was documented
among residents living close to waste sites12 and was linked
to inhalation exposure to endotoxin, microorganisms, and
aerosols from waste collection and land filling.27
Occupational exposure to organic dust, particulate mat-
ters from microbial, plant or animal origin, has been asso-
ciated with an increased risk of lung cancer in a pooled
analysis of case-control studies.25 High lung cancer mortal-
ity was found among male residents of Italian National
Priority Contaminated Sites with industrial waste landfills
or illegal dumps29 and among residents living near inciner-
ators and landfills of hazardous waste in Spain,30 but the
overall evidence that residing near landfills is associated
with increased risk of lung cancer is still inadequate.10
This study attempted to overcome some of the limita-
tions of the previously conducted studies, which included
issues of study design, exposure assessment and confound-
ing.11 We used a residential cohort approach to provide a
more detailed estimation of the population at risk. To each
subject in the cohort we assigned an H2S exposure
value(corresponding to the estimated H2S concentration at
the baseline address). It was not possible to consider
indexes of average or cumulative exposure based on the
different residences, because only a few municipality data-
bases provided information about changes of residence
during the follow-up. For this reason, individual exposure
reflects residence at the beginning of the follow-up.
Previous studies have considered distance from landfills
as a proxy of exposure.4,7,9 Distance-to source is easy to
understand because it assumes that people living near the
landfill are more exposed than people living further away.
We used modelled H2S concentrations as an exposure
measure of the landfill gases, on the assumption that the
pollution from landfills does not spread uniformly around
the site but depends on the quantity of incoming waste, the
prevailing winds and the orography of the area.3 Our re-
sults for hospitalizations were confirmed when we used
distance from the source as the exposure variable instead
of modelled H2S concentrations. There are, however, sev-
eral aspects in the exposure assessment process we used
that should be considered. H2S generation rates were taken
from EPA published material, and waste acceptance cap-
acity and waste acceptance rates were from derived from
legal authorized values. It is likely, then, that the derived
absolute emissions data were more accurate for the recent
period and less certain for the past. On the other hand, we
used the shape of the H2S concentrations on the ground to
rank subjects as more exposed or less exposed, and this
shape is of greater importance than the exact absolute val-
ues. Of course, the major limitation of our exposure assess-
ment is related to the lack of a validation study with in situ
measurements. Nonetheless, SPRAY is a consolidated
model that has been validated using a ‘conventional’ valid-
ation framework,31 and its performances and efficiency
have been evaluated and validated in multiple real condi-
tions with different orography, size of domain, number of
grid cells in the domain, meteorological conditions and
emission types.32–34 The model has been already used in
other locations to study health effects of waste manage-
ment.3,17 Another aspect of concern is the use of meteoro-
logical parameters that greatly influence the dispersion of
the pollutants. We considered the year 2005 as representa-
tive of the study area meteorological conditions because
there were no particular meteorological anomalies in that
year. Running the dispersion model with meteorological
data for different years could change the landfills footprint
only in presence of extreme weather conditions that
strongly affect the annual average. In our opinion, the dif-
ference among years is generally minimal and the uncer-
tainty associated with the use of specific meteorological
data is negligible.
Our results were adjusted for several confounders: age,
socioeconomic position and variables related to the envir-
onmental context (proximity to roads with heavy traffic,
proximity to industrial sites, air quality) that might other-
wise distort the study association. In particular, high level
of PM10 (> 90 percentile of the distribution vs < 50 per-
centile) was associated in our model with cardiovascular
and respiratory hospitalizations (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01–
1.16 and HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96–1.12, respectively).
However, no data were available on the personal habits of
the subjects, which could have had a role in the diseases
investigated, especially cigarette smoking but also alcohol
use, physical activity and obesity. The collection of this

 information, through telephone interviews or home visits,
would have been prohibitive for such a large cohort, and
the lack of this information may have biased the results be-
cause of confounding not controlled in the analysis. It
should be noted, however, that many personal habits are
associated with socioeconomic position. It is therefore rea-
sonable to assume that the analysis that adjusted for
socioeconomic index also took into account others individ-
ual variables, including smoking. Moreover, excess of hos-
pitalizations for respiratory diseases were found also in
children, and no excess mortality/morbidity for cardiovas-
cular diseases (indicative of most of the unmeasured life-
style factors including smoking) was found, despite the
larger statistical power than for respiratory diseases.
Therefore,
although
residual
confounding
cannot
be
excluded, it is unlikely that the observed relationship be-
tween H2S exposure and respiratory disturbances could be
entirely due to unmeasured smoking habits and other
factors.
In conclusion, we found associations between H2S ex-
posure from landfills and mortality from lung cancer as
well as mortality and morbidity for respiratory diseases.
The link with respiratory diseases has been observed in
other studies and it is potentially related to irritant gases
and other organic contaminants. The excess of lung cancer
is a relatively new finding.
