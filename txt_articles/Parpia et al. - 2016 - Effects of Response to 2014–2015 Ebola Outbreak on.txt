EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
Malaria prevention and control are major foreign assistance objectives of the U.S. Government. 
In May 2009, President Barack Obama announced the Global Health Initiative (GHI) to reduce 
the burden of disease and promote healthy communities and families around the world. The 
President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) is a core component of the GHI, along with human 
immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, tuberculosis, maternal and child 
health, family planning and reproductive health, nutrition, and neglected tropical diseases.   
 
PMI was launched in June 2005 as a five-year, $1.2 billion initiative to rapidly scale up malaria 
prevention and treatment interventions and reduce malaria-related mortality by 50% in 15 high-
burden countries in sub-Saharan Africa. With the passage of the 2008 Lantos-Hyde Act, funding 
was extended and, as part of the GHI, the goal of PMI was adjusted to reduce malaria-related 
mortality by 70% in the original 15 countries by the end of 2015. Programming of PMI activities 
follows the core principles of GHI: encouraging country ownership and investing in country-led 
plans and health systems; increasing impact and efficiency through strategic coordination and 
programmatic integration; strengthening and leveraging key partnerships, multilateral 
organizations, and private contributions; implementing a woman- and girl-centered approach; 
improving monitoring and evaluation (M&E); and promoting research and innovation.    
 
In June 2011, Guinea was selected to receive funding during the sixth year of PMI. Guinea has 
year-round malaria transmission with high transmission from July through October in most 
areas. Malaria is considered the number one public health problem in the country. National 
statistics in Guinea show that among children less than five years of age, malaria accounts for 
31% of consultations, 25% of hospitalizations, and 14% of hospital deaths in public facilities.  
 
A Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) was carried out in mid-2012, and the results provide 
concrete baseline information for key malaria indicators. The DHS reported a wide range of 
malaria prevalence across Guinea’s regions, ranging from 66% in Faranah to 3% in Conakry, but 
with a relatively high prevalence of 44% as the national average. Survey estimates show that 
approximately 47% of households own at least one insecticide-treated mosquito net (ITN), and 
26% and 28% of children under five and pregnant women, respectively, slept under an ITN the 
night before the survey. Roughly 18% of women surveyed had received at least two doses of 
intermittent preventive treatment during their last pregnancy, and less than 1% of children under 
five with fever in the two weeks preceding the survey received artemisinin-based combination 
therapy (ACT) on the same or next day of fever development. 
 
This FY 2015 Malaria Operational Plan (MOP) was developed with the participation of the 
National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) and other country partners during a planning visit 
carried out on April 24-May 2, 2014 by staff from the U.S. Agency for International 
Development (USAID) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The activities 
that PMI is proposing for this Year 5 complement the contributions of other partners and directly 
support the NMCP’s strategic plan. PMI will support activities related to malaria policies, health 
system strengthening, monitoring and evaluation, and commodity procurement and distribution 
 5 
 
on a nation-wide level, with remaining activities targeted to Conakry’s 5 communes and 14 of 
Guinea’s prefectures. The NMCP will submit a concept note for the new funding mechanism of 
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) that will procure 
commodities for nationwide distribution, but will target the remaining 19 prefectures of the 
country for select activities such as training and supervision. The proposed FY 2015 PMI budget 
for Guinea is $12,500,000. The following paragraphs describe current progress to date as well as 
the FY 2015 plans: 
 
Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs): The national malaria strategy is to support free distribution of 
long lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) through antenatal care (ANC) and vaccination 
clinics; free distribution through mass campaigns; and the sale of LLINs in the commercial 
sector. In May 2013, more than 3.2 million LLINs were distributed in the 19 prefectures 
supported by the Global Fund. In October/November 2013, a total of 2,061,584 nets were 
distributed in 14 prefectures supported by PMI. The campaign will be completed in 2014 with 
the distribution of nets in the five communes of Conakry. With FY 2015 funding, PMI will 
procure 565,000 LLINs: 515,000 for the next mass distribution planned for 2016, and 50,000 for 
routine distribution. PMI will also provide funds for distribution of both campaign and routine 
nets. In addition, PMI plans to support behavior change communication (BCC) activities, 
including mass media and community-level approaches (e.g., local radio stations, women’s 
groups) to increase demand for and promote correct and consistent use of LLINs. 
 
Indoor residual spraying (IRS): The new national malaria strategy includes IRS, but this 
activity is not currently implemented by the government. Limited spraying in the country is 
carried out by mining companies which spray work sites and surrounding areas. Current PMI 
support is being used to conduct standard entomological surveillance including species 
identification and insecticide resistance, and to build capacity of key personnel to conduct and 
manage an entomological surveillance program. With FY 2015 funds, PMI will continue to 
support surveillance and support skills building within the NMCP and other national structures to 
conduct entomologic surveillance. 
 
Malaria in Pregnancy (MIP): The national malaria strategy, which was developed and adopted 
in collaboration with the National Safe Motherhood Program, follows current World Health 
Organization (WHO) recommendation. It includes the administration of intermittent preventive 
treatment (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) under the direct observation of an ANC 
attendant, at four-week intervals, starting in the second trimester, with at least three treatments 
given before delivery, and the provision of an ITN at the time of the first visit. The data from the 
2012 DHS show that while 85% of pregnant women make at least one ANC visit, only 18% 
receive two or more doses of IPTp (up from 3% in the 2005 DHS). During the last 12 months, 
PMI procured and distributed nationwide 375,000 SP treatments, and has ordered 180,000 ITNs, 
which will be targeted for distribution through ANC, most likely in late 2014 and into 2015. 
Using FY 2015 funds, PMI will procure approximately 922,500 treatments of SP to meet 
approximately 60% of the nationwide need, and purchase 50,000 ITNs for routine distribution. 
PMI support will train and facilitate supervision in PMI target zones as well as promote IPTp 
uptake and ITN use among pregnant women as part of an integrated communication package.

Case Management – Diagnosis: The national malaria strategy and policy recommends 
diagnostic confirmation of all suspected malaria cases, among all patients, with either 
microscopy (when available) or a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), before they are treated. RDTs are 
provided free of charge (but microscopy is not free). In addition to ensuring that RDTs are 
available in health facilities, the NMCP is working toward having a continuous supply of RDTs 
at the community level for use by community health workers (CHWs). During the last 12 
months, PMI procured 5 million RDTs for the entire country. PMI is also in the process of 
procuring microscopes and related laboratory supplies for select health facilities, which will be 
combined with previous microscope procurements to make available 100 microscopes: 63 from 
PMI and 37 from Global Fund. This will ensure that each of the country’s 36 hospitals, as well as 
about 28 health centers will be fully equipped: two microscopes per hospital, and one 
microscope in each of 28 selected health centers. PMI supported the training of 41health facility 
clinicians and 554 CHWs in RDT use, and 25 laboratory technicians in RDT use and 
microscopy. Using FY 2015 funds, PMI will procure 3,460,000 RDTs and related laboratory 
supplies, as well as provide support for training and supervision of health facility clinicians and 
CHWs in RDT use, and laboratory technicians in microscopy and RDT use. Finally, PMI will 
continue to reinforce the quality control/quality assurance system for laboratories it helped 
established using FY 2014 funding. 
 
Case Management - Treatment: In Guinea, the first-line ACTs for uncomplicated malaria are 
artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL). These recommendations 
apply to facilities in all sectors and at all levels of the health system. In cases of AS-AQ or AL 
intolerance, side effects, or treatment failure, the patient should be referred to the nearest health 
facility. Per national policy, pregnant women in their first trimester with uncomplicated malaria 
are to be treated with oral quinine; in the second and third trimesters, they are to be treated with 
AS-AQ. The ACTs are free for adults and children (as are RDTs), but patients have to pay for 
other drugs received (such as anti-pyretic) as well as for microscopy tests. As stated in the 
strategy, the first choice for treatment of severe malaria is intravenous or intramuscular injectable 
artesunate. Other acceptable treatments include injectable artemether or quinine. With FY 2015 
funding PMI will procure and distribute approximately 1,735,000 ACTs for treatment of 
uncomplicated malaria; 76,100 treatments of injectable artesunate and 20,000 treatments of 
injectable artemether for severe malaria; and 15,500treatments of rectal artesunate for pre-
referral treatment of severe malaria in the community. PMI will also support training and 
supervision of health workers and CHWs. 
 
Pharmaceutical Management:  The national policy is to deliver malaria treatment and 
prevention commodities through the public system via the Pharmacie Centrale de Guinée 
(PCG). Since PMI’s inception in Guinea in FY 2011, efforts to assist this institution and enable it 
to perform the core functions of supply chain management and distribution of commodities to 
end users have been slowed down by lack of commitment from PCG leadership. As a result, PMI 
decided in FY 2014 to ensure that PMI commodities are distributed through a temporary 
arrangement. In the meantime, efforts to support improvement of the drugs regulatory system 
have also been very slow. However, with PMI’s endorsement of the findings of the audit of the 
Guinea pharmaceutical system conducted with European Union support in 2012, PMI and its 
supply chain partners are assisting both PCG and the Directorate of Pharmacies and Laboratories 
(DNPL) to implement the recommendations, mainly governance-related reforms that will 
 7 
 
significantly improve their performance. With FY 2015 funding, PMI will continue its support 
for the implementation of those reforms as well as strengthening the logistic management 
information system ensuring that consumption data are collected on a regular basis to quantify 
needs and ensure effective distribution of all malaria commodities regardless of the source. 
 
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E): A new national M&E plan has been validated to 
complement the revised national strategic plan. The M&E plan identifies indicators, targets, and 
data sources and emphasizes data collection, data quality assurance, and dissemination and use 
of data. The 2012 DHS report has been finalized providing a baseline for PMI and the country 
itself, as it works to achieve Roll Back Malaria (RBM) objectives. A malaria indicator survey 
(MIS), planned for 2014 but postponed to 2015 due to the Ebola outbreak, will provide interim 
estimates for coverage indicators, as well as malaria prevalence. A new monthly malaria 
reporting form is currently being used in the PMI target zones with completion rates of 80%. 
This reporting tool will be rolled out to the remaining districts in the coming year to ensure 
routine malaria data reflects the entire country. Several new M&E activities are currently being 
planned for implementation in the next year: a Service Availability and Readiness Assessment 
(SARA) survey, health facility-based surveillance, LLIN monitoring, and therapeutic efficacy 
monitoring. With FY 2015 funding, PMI will continue to support the end-use verification survey 
(EUV), health facility-based surveillance, and routine system strengthening. It will also support a 
health facility survey to assess progress in case management practices, as well as prospective 
LLIN durability monitoring starting with the next mass campaign, and therapeutic efficacy 
monitoring of Guinea’s first-line ACT in two of the four monitoring sites. 
 
Behavior Change and Communication (BCC): The NMCP’s malaria communication plan was 
revised in 2012 and emphasizes appropriate strategies and channels to reach various target 
groups with culturally appropriate messaging on malaria prevention and control. A BCC 
Technical Working Group has yet to be established but that is a key activity that will be 
implemented in the coming year. In the last year, BCC activities have focused most intently on 
the LLIN mass distribution campaign. BCC activities have also focused on training of health 
workers, including at the community level, to conduct sensitization activities around an 
integrated package of malaria prevention and treatment messages. Animators from local non-
governmental organization (NGOs) have also been trained to implement BCC activities. The 
PMI implementing partner is also increasing focus on building the evidence base for 
interventions through formative data collection. With FY 2015 funding, BCC activities will 
continue to focus on the key malaria prevention and treatment messages developed and agreed 
upon by the Technical Working Group while strengthening efforts at monitoring and evaluation. 
A portion of BCC funding will also be devoted to an integrated package of health messaging. 
 
Health Systems Strengthening/Capacity Building: Guinea’s health system continues to face 
important challenges, among which the management capacity of the NMCP and human resource 
limitations for health are the most critical. During the past year, PMI support to the health system 
has focused on assessing the organizational and management capabilities of the NMCP in order 
to support the Government of Guinea (GOG) to reinforce the program. PMI also supported 
training of health workers at health facility and community levels in RDTs use and case 
management in order to improve malaria care delivery. PMI will support the health system 
through implementing recommendations of the NMCP assessment and through training of newly 
 8 
 
recruited health workers who will be deployed to PMI-supported prefectures and beyond. PMI 
will also focus on supporting supervision of the logistic and pharmaceutical management 
systems as well as monitoring and evaluation through establishing a malaria database that will 
link up with the national health management information system.

STRATEGY 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
 
MALARIA SITUATION IN GUINEA 
 
Guinea is a coastal country in West Africa composed of four areas with distinct ecologies: lower 
Guinea, which includes the coastal lowlands; middle Guinea, the mountainous region running 
north-south in the middle of the country; the sahelian upper Guinea; and the forested jungle area 
in the south. Guinea borders Guinea-Bissau and Senegal to the north, Mali and Côte d’Ivoire to 
the east, and Liberia and Sierra Leone to the south. Guinea has 33 prefectures (districts) divided 
into eight administrative regions, one of which is the capital city of Conakry and its five 
communes. Guinea’s entire estimated population of 11.7 million people is at risk of malaria.1 
According to the 2013 Human Development Index, Guinea has among the lowest health and 
                                                 
1 According to the NMCP 2014 gap analysis, the population in 2014 is projected to be 11,767,987; 2015 is estimated 
to be 12,132,795. This reflects a 3.1% population growth rate based on 2009 census figures. 
The President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) is a core component of the Global Health Initiative 
(GHI), along with HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. PMI was launched in June 2005 as a five-year, 
$1.2 billion initiative to rapidly scale up malaria prevention and treatment interventions and 
reduce malaria-related mortality by 50% in 15 high-burden countries in sub-Saharan Africa.  
With passage of the 2008 Lantos-Hyde Act, funding for PMI was extended and, as part of the 
GHI, the goal of PMI was adjusted to reduce malaria-related mortality by 70% in the original 15 
countries by the end of 2015. This will be achieved by continuing to scale up coverage of the 
most vulnerable groups — children under five years of age and pregnant women — with proven 
preventive and therapeutic interventions, including artemisinin-based combination therapies 
(ACTs), insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), intermittent preventive treatment for pregnant women 
(IPTp), and indoor residual spraying (IRS). 
 
Guinea was selected as a PMI country in FY 2011. Large-scale implementation of ACTs and 
IPTp began in Guinea in 2011 and has progressed rapidly with support from PMI and other 
partners. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), ACTs, and IPTp are now available across the country in 
public health facilities. In addition, over 5 million long-lasting ITNs have been distributed 
through a mass distribution campaign. 
 
This FY 2015 Malaria Operational Plan (MOP) presents a detailed implementation plan for 
Guinea, based on the United States government malaria strategy and Guinea’s national malaria 
strategy. The MOP was developed in consultation with the National Malaria Control Program 
(NMCP) and with the participation of national and international partners involved in malaria 
prevention and control in the country. The activities that PMI proposes to support reflect 
priorities outlined in the National Malaria Control Strategic Plan for 2013-2017 (national 
strategy) and build on investments made by PMI and other partners to improve and expand 
malaria-related services, including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria 
(Global Fund). This document briefly reviews the current status of malaria control policies and 
interventions in Guinea, describes progress to date, identifies challenges and unmet needs to 
achieving NMCP and PMI targets, and provides a description of planned FY 2015 activities. 
 10 
 
development indicators, ranking 178 out of 187 countries.2 Poverty has been steadily increasing 
over the past decade, and as of 2010 over half (58%) of Guinea’s population lives below the 
Guinean government’s poverty line of $196 USD per person per year.3The rate of 
alphabetization is 34%. Infant and under-five mortality rates are 81 and 130 per 1,000 live births, 
respectively.4 Although the antenatal care (ANC) coverage of at least one visit is high (88%), the 
lifetime risk of maternal death is one of the worst in the world, at 1 in 26.5 
 
Guinea has year-round malaria transmission with peak transmission from July through October 
in most areas. The two main vectors are Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus. According 
to the national strategy, malaria remains the number one public health problem in Guinea, with 
92% of malaria infections caused by Plasmodium falciparum (2012 DHS). The annual incidence 
rate in 2011 is estimated to be 92/1,000.6 Malaria mortality, however, is clearly under-reported in 
health facilities, as national statistics show only 530 deaths due to malaria from 2009-2011. 
National statistics in Guinea also show that among children less than five years of age, malaria 
accounts for 31% of consultations, 25% of hospitalizations, and 14% of hospital deaths.7 This 
estimate does not include malaria cases seen in the community or in private facilities. Among the 
general population, malaria is also the primary cause of consultations (34%), hospitalizations 
(31%), and death (14%) according to the Ministry of Health (MOH).8 Most malaria cases 
reported through the national health management information system are clinically diagnosed, 
and therefore may not accurately reflect the true malaria burden. 
 
According to the 2012 Demographic Health Survey (DHS), the prevalence of malaria ranges 
between 3% in Conakry and 66% in Faranah with a national prevalence of 44% for children 6-59 
months using microscopy, and 47% based on RDT results. Parasitemia prevalence shows strong 
variations by place of residence with 53% in rural areas compared to 18% in urban areas 
(strongly influenced by Conakry). The survey results also show that 77% of children 6-59 
months have anemia, and 16% have severe anemia (Hgb<8g/dl).9 
 
Coverage estimates for key interventions show room for improvement in reaching targets. A 
little more than half of households surveyed have at least one mosquito net, treated or untreated 
(53%), while 47% of households own at least one ITN. These proportions are somewhat higher 
in rural areas (55% and 50%) than in urban (48% and 42%). The proportions of children who 
slept under any mosquito net and under an ITN the night before the survey are 29% and 26%, 
respectively. These proportions are higher in rural areas (30% and 27%) than in urban (28% and 
24%). In households with an ITN, the proportion of children under five years of age who slept 
under an ITN the night before the survey was 51% with no difference between urban and rural 
households. One in three pregnant women reported sleeping under any mosquito net (33%) while

28% reported sleeping under an ITN. In households with an ITN, the proportion of pregnant 
women who slept under an ITN the night before the survey was 59%. This proportion is higher 
in urban (62%) than rural (58%) areas. Coverage with IRS remains relatively low as this 
intervention has not been part of the national malaria control strategy. Therefore, limited IRS 
activities are happening in the country (1.7% of households per year, 2012 DHS), mainly in the 
mining sector (BHP Biliton, Global Alumina, Vale and RioTinto). 
 
Malaria treatment indicators reflect low coverage: Among children less than five years old with 
fever in the two weeks before the DHS survey, 37.1% had sought advice or treatment for the 
fever, 28% had received any antimalarial treatment, and less than 1% received an ACT on the 
same or next day. While 17% received any antimalarial treatment (same or next day), many of 
these (6.1%) received chloroquine. Among children less than five years old with fever in the last 
two weeks before the survey who received any antimalarial, 4.8% received an ACT, while 35.7% 
received chloroquine and 30.7% received quinine. 
 
Since 2005, prevention of malaria among pregnant women using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine 
(SP) was included in the national ANC health package with support to the NMCP from several 
partners. PMI will focus on improving prevention of malaria in pregnancy (MIP) as only 18% of 
women reported receiving two or more doses of SP during their last pregnancy (2012 DHS). 
 
COUNTRY HEALTH SYSTEM DELIVERY STRUCTURE AND MOH 
ORGANIZATION 
 
The health care system in Guinea is managed by the MOH and based on the administrative 
division of the country into eight regions. Within the eight regions are 38 health districts 
composed of 334 rural communities and 38 urban municipalities. The MOH has three levels in 
its administrative structure: central, intermediate, and peripheral. The health system is organized 
around a pyramidal structure on three levels: 
� The central level includes the cabinet of the Minister of Health (Secretary General, 
advisers, chief of staff, and support services), National Directorates, and related services. 
� The intermediate level includes the Regional Directorates of Health (DRS). 
� The peripheral level includes the Prefectural and Municipal Directorates of Health 
(DPS/DCS). 
The provision of care is provided by public and private subsectors. Public health facilities consist 
of health posts, health centers, prefectural hospitals, regional hospitals, and national hospitals. 
Community health workers (CHWs) attached to public facilities provide essential basic care at 
the community level, particularly in the management and prevention of malaria. 
 
Public health facilities are organized into three levels that provide primary, secondary and 
tertiary health care: 
1. The first level is represented by the health district and consists of three levels:10 
                                                 
10 The number of health posts and hospitals are based on 2011 estimates; the number of health centers is based on a 
2013 estimate. 
 12 
 
� About 963 health posts provide basic primary care and serve several villages 
(about 3,000 people) each. Health posts are staffed by an agent technique de 
santé, a clinical officer with three years of training. 
� About 413 health centers provide preventive and curative care and supervise the 
health posts. Health centers are staffed by several clinicians, including nurses, 
midwives and doctors.  
� About 33 district hospitals serve as a reference for health centers and provide care 
to an average of 285,777 people in the district. 
2. The second level is represented by the regional hospital and serves as a reference for the 
districts. There are seven regional hospitals plus nine municipal hospitals providing care 
to an estimated 1,401,400 people in the region. 
3. The third level consists of the university hospitals at the national level. This is the highest 
level of reference for specialized care and includes two such hospitals in the country. 
 
In addition to public structures, Guinea has a large number of private structures and traditional 
practitioners. At the community level, health and hygiene committees have the responsibility of 
understanding health issues, monitoring health programs, and coordinating with local medical 
officers to improve access and quality of care in their communities. 
 
Access to care is a major problem in Guinea. The MOH estimates that only 55% of the 
population has access to public health care services. The MOH is investing heavily in 
community case management through a trained nationwide cadre of CHWs to expand health care 
access to communities, especially in remote and inaccessible areas. A comprehensive policy on 
community health care has been elaborated; 3,300 CHWs have been trained and now provide 
health education and basic curative care to surrounding communities. The cadre of CHWs has 
been specifically trained to diagnose malaria using RDTs and provide ACTs to patients with 
uncomplicated malaria. Guinea’s MOH strongly supports integration of priority national health 
programs, including malaria, HIV/AIDs, neglected tropical diseases, nutrition, reproductive 
health and family planning, safe delivery, and epidemic surveillance. 
 
COUNTRY MALARIA CONTROL STRATEGY 
 
The national strategic plan covers a period of five years: 2013-2017. The goal is to reduce 
malaria-related morbidity by 75% compared to 2000, and to reduce malaria mortality to near 
zero by the end of 2017. 
 
National Strategic Plan objectives: 
 
� Protect at least 80% of the population with effective preventive interventions for malaria; 
� Ensure biological confirmation of at least 90% of suspected malaria cases; 
� Ensure prompt and effective treatment of at least 90% of malaria cases; 
� Strengthen monitoring and evaluation (M&E) at all levels in accordance with the 
NMCP’s monitoring and evaluation plan; 
� Strengthen management capacity, partnership, and program coordination at all levels; and 
� Increase the population’s knowledge about prevention and management of malaria. 
 13 
 
Main interventions: 
� Ensure universal access to prevention measures for the entire population, including ITNs 
and IPTp; 
� Protect the entire population in areas targeted for IRS; 
� Ensure laboratory confirmation by RDT or microscopy for all suspected cases of malaria 
seen in health facilities (public, confessional, and private sectors) and community; 
� Ensure proper management of all confirmed malaria cases at all levels of the health 
pyramid, including the community level; 
� Strengthen entomological surveillance in sentinel sites; 
� Strengthen epidemiological surveillance of malaria through Integrated Disease 
Surveillance and Response at all levels of the health pyramid; 
� Strengthen M&E at all levels for the collection and analysis of high quality data to inform 
decision making; 
� Strengthen behavior change communication (BCC) to increase uptake of malaria 
prevention and treatment interventions; 
� Strengthen coordination capacity and program management at all levels; 
� Ensure availability of commodities at all levels for malaria prevention, diagnosis and 
treatment; 
� Strengthen the partnership of Roll Back Malaria (RBM) to mobilize funding through the 
state budget, the private sector, and partners; and 
� Strengthen international and sub-regional cooperation in the fight against malaria. 
 
INTEGRATION, COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION 
 
The NMCP has developed partnerships with various organizations and institutions involved in 
the fight against malaria, including: PMI, Research Triangle Institute, Plan Guinea, Population 
Services International, Catholic Relief Services, German Development Cooperation, Medecins 
sans Frontières, Helen Keller International, Engender Health, Rio Tinto, Islamic Development 
Bank, World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), World 
Bank, Japanese International Cooperation Agency, Global Fund, and sub-regional organizations. 
This partnership reinforces the collaboration and coordination between malaria stakeholders for 
the benefit of the Guinean population and will be strengthened by the establishment of a 
Coordinating Committee of functional partners. 
 
The goal of integration is to increase efficiency in the use of available health resources in the 
country and coordinate the participation of partners in order to reduce malaria mortality and 
morbidity, particularly among children and pregnant women. According to the new national 
strategy, dwindling resources, the involvement of various partners, and the need to rapidly scale 
up interventions highlight the necessity and urgency of developing mechanisms for integration 
and effective coordination at national, regional, and district levels.  
 
Strengthening community participation in the planning and delivery of health services to the 
people is a challenge requiring active involvement of community networks, structured groups, 
and opinion leaders in all villages. Partnership between private and public entities is another 
challenge that will be achieved through a contractual approach in the implementation of control 
activities. Integration of the private and religious sectors in Guinea is also a priority. Importantly, 
 14 
 
the MOH has established an inter-sectorial collaboration by developing a partnership between 
the MOH and other non-health sectors such as education, environment, social affairs, the private 
sector, and other non-governmental structures. 
 
PMI GOALS, TARGETS & INDICATORS 
 
The goal of PMI is to reduce malaria-associated mortality by 70% compared to pre-Initiative 
levels in the 15 original PMI countries and to reduce malaria-associated mortality by 50% in new 
countries added to PMI in FY 2010 and later, including Guinea. By the end of 2015, PMI will 
assist Guinea to achieve the following targets in populations at risk for malaria: 
� >90% of households with a pregnant woman and/or children under five will own at least 
one ITN; 
� 85% of children under five will have slept under an ITN the previous night; 
� 85% of pregnant women will have slept under an ITN the previous night; 
� 85% of houses in geographic areas targeted for IRS will have been sprayed; 
� 85% of pregnant women and children under five will have slept under an ITN the 
previous night or in a house that has been sprayed with IRS in the last 6 months; 
� 85% of women who have completed a pregnancy in the last two years will have received 
two or more doses of IPTp during that pregnancy; 
� 85% of government health facilities have ACTs available for treatment of uncomplicated 
malaria; and  
� 85% of children under five with suspected or confirmed malaria will have received 
treatment with ACTs within 24 hours of onset of their symptoms. 
 
PROGRESS ON COVERAGE/IMPACT INDICATORS TO DATE 
 
Progress in malaria prevention and treatment in Guinea will be assessed by comparing the 
standardized coverage indicators for ITN ownership and use, IPTp, and prompt and effective 
treatment across national household surveys. The 2012 DHS provides the first national 
parasitemia measures. Important progress is shown between the 2005 and 2012 DHS, likely 
reflecting support from Global Fund Rounds 2 and 6, including a targeted ITN distribution 
campaign in 2009. In recent years, however, stockouts of ITNs, ACTs, and other commodities 
have slowed initial gains, as reflected in the 2012 DHS results. 
 
According to the 2005 DHS, only 27% of households owned any mosquito net with less than 4% 
owning an ITN. Only 1% of children under five and pregnant women reported sleeping under an 
ITN. Less than 3% of women reported receiving at least two doses of SP during their last 
pregnancy. The 2007 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) showed slight improvements in 
ITN ownership and use, but these rates are still quite low. 
 
The 2009 and 2010 national coverage surveys, conducted with Global Fund financing, appear to 
show substantial improvements in key indicators. After a nationwide targeted ITN distribution 
campaign in 2009, the 2010 survey predictably shows increases in ITN ownership and use: 79% 
of households reported owning at least one ITN, and 60% of children under five and 47% of 
pregnant women reported sleeping under an ITN, respectively. Even more striking are the 
apparent gains in IPTp coverage in 2009 and 2010 compared to the 2005 DHS. While not even 
 15 
 
3% of women received two or more doses of SP during their last pregnancy in 2005, 36% and 
41% received it in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Direct comparisons between the DHS and the 
2009 and 2010 national coverage surveys should be made with caution due to some apparent 
methodological differences in how indicators were calculated and reported. The specific 
differences are noted in the indicator table. 
 
The 2012 DHS provides an important data point for ITN coverage since it was conducted prior to 
the universal coverage campaign implemented in phases from May 2013 through May 2014. Not 
surprisingly, since over two years have passed since the last targeted distribution (with no routine 
distribution in the interim), ITN coverage and use indicators dropped since the 2010 survey, with 
less than half of all households reportedly owning an ITN, and 26% and 28% of children under 
five and pregnant women, respectively, reporting sleeping under an ITN. Coverage of IPTp (at 
least two doses of SP) has also dropped to 18%. The prompt and effective treatment indicator is 
particularly low with less than 1% of children under five with fever receiving treatment with 
ACTs within the same or next day of fever onset. Estimates for malaria-associated anemia (cut-
off value of Hgb<8g/dl) show 16% prevalence for children 6-59 months. The country’s first 
parasitemia measures (via microscopy) show an estimated prevalence of 44% for the country. 
Conakry has the lowest prevalence at 3%, while the regions with the highest prevalence 
estimates are Faranah and N’Zérékoré with 66% and 59%, respectively. 
 
The following table summarizes coverage indicators for malaria control, as well as anemia and 
parasitemia, from national household surveys since 2005. Due to some variations in survey 
methodology, not all indicators are directly comparable; please consider the footnotes at the 
bottom of the table.

OTHER RELEVANT EVIDENCE ON PROGRESS 
 
As PMI begins its fourth year of program implementation and benefits from some continuity of 
operations, it is evident that the country’s malaria program has achieved (or is in the process of 
achieving) some major milestones: the first universal coverage long lasting insecticide-treated 
net (LLIN) campaign, decreased stockouts of ACTs, roll out of RDTs, and the first nationally 
representative parasitemia estimates. In addition, both epidemiological and commodities malaria 
data in the PMI target zones are now flowing from health facilities to the district level to be 
compiled and sent to the national level. 
 
There is also evidence of increased capacity at the NMCP to coordinate and guide activities 
throughout the country. New staff has been hired and important processes such as the Malaria 
Program Review have helped the program take a critical look at its operations and revise its 
National Strategic Plan, M&E Plan, and policy guidelines which were signed in early 2014.

Local research conducted by the Mafèrinyah Training and Research Center is contributing to the 
knowledge base of malaria in Guinea: 
� 
A therapeutic efficacy study conducted between 2011 and 2012 in subjects aged six 
months to 45 years has shown adequate clinical and parasitological response of 97%.12 
This study followed the WHO protocol, including a standard 28-day follow-up period. 
� 
An epidemiological study aimed at examining the seasonal burden of malaria (low and 
high transmission seasons) in Guinea’s four climatic zones is ongoing. 
� Recent discussions with the Mafèrinyah researchers have revealed potential areas for 
PMI collaboration for operational research and M&E. 
A new collaboration between the CDC entomology team and the University of Gamal Abdel 
Nasser of Conakry will be focusing on descriptive entomological monitoring of vectors in the 
country and supporting a new insectary in Conakry.  
 
CHALLENGES, OPPORTUNITIES & THREATS 
 
Challenges and threats 
 
The NMCP infrastructure is weakened by inadequate material, human, and financial resources:  
� Variable electricity supply, no generator, no network internet connectivity, little fuel for 
vehicles, and a difficult location in the middle of a busy market pose challenges to 
productivity.  
� Challenges related to staff training and capacity (and in some cases with unclear terms of 
reference) prevent the NMCP from performing at full potential given limited resources.  
� Lack of finances precludes the NMCP from procuring needed supplies and commodities 
and meeting operational expenses. As an illustration, only 2.54% (approximately $22 
million) of the national budget is allocated to the health sector by the Government of 
Guinea (GOG). Seventy percent of the annual national budget pays for salaries, leaving 
only $6 million to purchase vaccines and support management of health facilities.  
 
Limitations to capacity for case management are linked to the following constraints:  
� Limited commodities, stockouts and lack of health care providers and supervisors results 
in non-adherence to the national policy by providers. 
� Inadequate M&E and data collection systems (health and logistical information 
management) limit the NMCP’s ability to obtain reliable data on disease burden; service 
access and utilization; quality and quantity of services provided; and needs, stocks, and 
consumption of commodities to guide policy and practice especially in the Global Fund 
zone. 
� The supply chain and pharmaceutical system is very weak and under reform based on the 
European Union (EU) audit report recommendation. This negatively affects the 
performance of the NMCP and results in frequent stockouts.

Active engagement of donors and partners represent opportunities for progress in malaria control 
in Guinea. In addition to the major donors, other partners such as the Islamic Development Bank, 
Japanese International Cooperation Agency, WHO, UNICEF, World Bank, and local NGOs will 
help the program to leverage resources as long as they are fully engaged with the NMCP. The 
strong potential for collaboration with the Peace Corps includes having volunteers support 
malaria prevention and education activities. Additionally, improved communications with the 
Maferinyah Training and Research Center has the potential to support improved training and 
research in Guinea. Although considered symbolic, the contribution of mining companies to 
malaria control efforts in Guinea is an opportunity that can be better leveraged with stronger 
coordination and constant dialogue between the GOG and mining operators. 
 
Discussions amongst the NMCP, PMI, and the Global Fund have resulted in an agreement to 
pursue a new approach for commodity procurement and distribution throughout the country. 
Rather than divide the country in “target zones,” each donor will procure commodities to meet 
national gaps in coverage and distribute commodities as needed without differentiation between 
zones. This mechanism will hopefully help to mitigate some of the stockout issues that have been 
a problem in the country. 
 
PMI SUPPORT STRATEGY 
 
In supporting Guinea’s national strategic plan, PMI focuses on the key intervention areas of ITN 
use, IPTp, and case management, including support for malaria diagnostics and treatment at the 
health facility and community levels. PMI also supports the cross-cutting areas of commodity 
management, entomological monitoring, BCC, M&E, operational research, and in-country 
capacity building. At the request of the NMCP, PMI initially targeted certain intervention 
activities, such as procurement and distribution of commodities, in 14 prefectures and the five 
communes of Conakry, while the remaining prefectures were covered by Global Fund. Under the 
coordination of the NMCP and in accordance with the PMI principle of filling the country gaps 
wherever they are, PMI is increasingly implementing activities nationwide such as M&E, 
training, and BCC. In response to a request from the NMCP, in May 2014, PMI will be 
distributing RDTs and ACTs in the Global Fund zones, which are experiencing stockouts while 
waiting for commodities ordered by the Global Fund to arrive in the country. To avoid future ad 
hoc arrangements like this, PMI and Global Fund will support the idea of a “common basket” of 
commodities with distribution to be coordinated by the NMCP. A guiding principle of PMI’s 
strategy is to support the population of Guinea through the most efficient and effective use of its 
resources and this new approach for commodity procurement supports that principle. 
 
PMI is considered a principal and credited partner by the NMCP. In order to achieve results, PMI 
support will utilize a variety of partners, but will focus efforts on one large, bilateral program 
that will be charged with building capacity in many of these areas. PMI is providing technical 
assistance through the presence of two resident advisors (one from USAID and one from CDC) 
and a national malaria expert (USAID locally employed staff) who will work closely on a day-
to-day basis with the NMCP to help build their capacity and improve national program 
performance, as well as advise and manage PMI implementing partners. Headquarters staff will 
 19 
 
provide additional technical assistance in specific technical areas such as M&E, entomology, and 
diagnostics. 
 
PMI support includes: 
� Procurement and delivery of commodities including LLINs, RDTs, ACTs, SP, and 
injectable and rectal artesunate; 
� Support for the pharmaceutical system to strengthen the logistics and information 
management system, pharmaceutical system reforms, and improvement of drug 
regulation capacity; 
� Support for training of health workers and community health workers on malaria case 
management and prevention of malaria in pregnancy; 
� Capacity building for lab staff to support and improve diagnostic capacity including 
quality control for microscopy; 
� Support for clinical supervision at health centers, health posts, and community levels; 
� Support for M&E at the local, district, regional, and national levels, including routine 
system strengthening, surveillance, data use for decision-making, and periodic household 
and health facility surveys; 
� Entomological support for monitoring and surveillance of vectors and capacity building 
for entomologists; 
� Support for BCC activities to increase knowledge and use of malaria commodities among 
the general population; 
� Support to NMCP to build its technical and leadership capacity to better coordinate 
malaria activities. 
PMI will continue to look for opportunities to support the implementation of the national malaria 
control strategy, which includes coordination with malaria donors and implementers as well as 
participating in a national-level coordination council to ensure transparency and synergy with 
key partners like the Global Fund. Future opportunities will include better communication and 
coordination with private sector players, as they are the primary means by which Guineans 
obtain health services. Increasingly, PMI will seek opportunities to engage in a close 
collaboration with mining sector partners that are active in malaria.

OPERATIONAL PLAN 
 
PREVENTION 
 
Insecticide-Treated Nets 
 
NMCP/PMI objectives 
 
The national strategic plan currently calls for two universal coverage campaigns: one in 
2013/2014 and another in 2016. The definition of universal coverage is one ITN per two persons. 
The current strategy includes universal campaigns and routine distribution for pregnant women 
and children less than one year old through ANC and the Expanded Program on Immunization 
(EPI). While the national strategy includes both routine and mass distribution, nets are currently 
only distributed through mass distribution campaigns. The NMCP plans to develop a specific 
strategy for routine distribution in the next year. The current goal is 80% coverage of the 
population at risk of malaria with ITNs by the end of 2017.  
 
Progress since PMI was launched 
 
The first actions in procuring ITNs were conducted in the last year and are described below. The 
2012 DHS indicated that 47% of households had at least one ITN. The percentages of those 
reported as sleeping under an ITN the previous night was 26% for children under the age of five, 
and 28% for pregnant women. When only those in possession of a net were considered, 51% of 
children under the age of five and 59% of pregnant women slept under an ITN the previous 
night. These data were collected between June and October 2012, which was three years after the 
first distribution of ITNs in 2009 that targeted children under the age of five and pregnant 
women.   
 
Progress during last the last 12 months 
 
During the last 12 months, the nets for the universal coverage campaign were procured. The 
universal coverage campaign was planned in two phases. Phase one took place during May 2013 
in the Global Fund-targeted prefectures. The second phase was the distribution in PMI-targeted 
zones, which took place in October-November 2013 (14 prefectures) and mid 2014 (the third 
phase of the mass distribution is planned for the end of May 2014 in the five communes of 
Conakry). During the May 2013 campaign over 3.2 million LLINs were distributed in 19 
prefectures with over 98% of campaign coupons recovered. The NMCP originally planned to use 
the 2014 Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) to get post-campaign coverage estimates, but due to the 
postponement of the survey, a Global Fund-financed coverage survey, fielded before the end of 
2014, will provide the needed estimates. [Update: the status of this survey is uncertain given the 
ongoing Ebola outbreak.] 
 
With FY 2011 and FY 2012 funds, PMI procured 1,590,000 LLINs for distribution in the 2013-
2014 campaign. Approximately 237,000 of the PMI-procured nets were used to cover the gap in 
nets needed in the first campaign phase, and the remainder was used for distribution in October-
November 2013, in which 2,061,584 ITNs were distributed. Other partners (Islamic 
 21 
 
Development Bank, Japanese International Cooperation Agency, and UNICEF) have provided 
nets to help cover the gap in the later phase of the campaign. The final distribution phase will 
take place in Conakry, which has the lowest malaria prevalence throughout the country (3% 
based on the 2012 DHS). In addition, reprogrammed FY 2013 funds were used to cover the costs 
of transporting these LLINs to distribution sites, planning, training, supervision, and social 
mobilization/communication for the campaign’s second phase. 
 
A coordination committee for the national campaign, established in February 2012, included 
personnel from the MOH, NMCP, and partner organizations including Catholic Relief Services, 
Faisons Ensemble, Maternal and Child Health Integrated Program, WHO, UNICEF, Country 
Coordinating Mechanism, Plan Guinea, Population Services International, Helen Keller 
International, Medecins sans Frontières, Child Fund, and PMI in-country staff. This committee 
was established to ensure adequate support for the planning, coordination, implementation, and 
evaluation of the 2013 national campaign.

*Surpluses are carried over into the next year, but deficits are not. It should be noted that ITNs 
have not been distributed yet through EPI so all routine ITNs will be made available for ANC. 
Thus there will be a carry-over from 2014 to 2015, which will be available for ANC until such 
time that ITNs are given during delivery of EPI services. 
Assumptions: Pregnant women are 4.5% of the total population. Children under 1 are 4% of the 
total population. Coverage of pregnant women by ANC (i.e., first visit) is 80% in 2014, 85% in 
2015, and 95% in 2016. Children included under EPI equal 100%. The universal campaign need
is the total population divided by 1.8. 
 
 
 22 
 
Plan and justification 
 
With FY 2015 funds, PMI proposes to procure and distribute 565,000 LLINs: 515,000 for the 
universal campaign planned for mid-2016, and 50,000 for routine distribution. Also, using 
reprogrammed FY 2014 funds, PMI will procure 235,000 LLINs for the 2016 universal 
campaign. PMI will work with the NMCP and partners to improve the routine system to ensure 
delivery of LLINs to facilities as they need them, as well as support training around a package of 
services provided during routine visits. Since the EPI program itself has yet to start, ITNs have 
not been distributed to this target group. Thus the plan is to continue to distribute all routine 
ITNs via ANC until a distribution plan through EPI is elaborated. Also, the NMCP is planning to 
submit a concept note to the Global Fund, which will include enough LLINs to fill the gap for 
the 2016 universal coverage campaign and for routine distribution.  
 
Proposed activities with FY 2015 funding: ($3,620,000) 
 
1. Procurement and delivery of LLINs: Procure 565,000 LLINs for the 2016 universal 
campaign and for routine services. This funding will include the cost of the nets and 
delivery to the district level ($3,020,000); 
2. Distribution of LLINs: Distribute approximately 600,000 LLINs for the universal 
campaign (which may include LLINs provided by other donors) and for routine 
services($600,000); and 
3. BCC for LLIN use: Continue to promote LLIN use as part of the integrated 
communication strategy following national guidelines and in collaboration with other 
partners (costs covered in BCC section). 
 
Indoor Residual Spraying 
 
NMCP/PMI objectives 
 
The 2013-2017 National Malaria Control Strategy does not include IRS as a major method of 
vector control, but notes that it has been used in emergency situations, including use in refugee 
camps between 2001 and 2005. IRS is also used by some mining companies in limited areas 
throughout the country. Although IRS is not currently a part of the national strategy, it is under 
consideration for future use.  
 
Progress since PMI was launched 
 
In July 2012 PMI funded a ten-day training course for 24 entomology personnel including 
entomologists from the MOH (four at the NMCP, one at the National Public Health Laboratory, 
one at the National Directorate of Public Hygiene, and three at the center for research in 
Maferinyah) and two entomological technicians from each of seven prefectures. Mosquito 
surveys and limited insecticide susceptibility assays were carried out in September 2012 in 
Boffa.

In the past year, sentinel sites have been identified in all four ecological regions for routine 
entomological surveillance, which includes pyrethrum spray catches, human landing catches, and 
light trap collection. In early 2014, entomological collections in Kissidougou and Kankan 
revealed a predominance of Anopheles gambiae s.l. in indoor collections.  Both M and S 
molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. were found in Kankan and analysis of the mosquitoes of 
Kissidougou is underway.  Anopheles mosquitoes other than An. gambiae s.l. were collected 
indoors and outdoors, but their importance in malaria transmission is unknown, though probably 
small. In addition, insecticide susceptibility tests will be conducted to determine the resistance 
status of Anopheles gambiae s.s., and other vectors if detected. Although no IRS activities are 
currently underway, the resistance status of malaria vectors is important for understanding the 
role of resistance in relation to the use of ITNs. It will also provide useful information if IRS is 
undertaken in the future. Discussions are also underway for the establishment of an 
insectary/laboratory to support these activities and ITN monitoring activities.   
 
Plan and justification 
 
The plan for FY 2015 funding is the continued collection of entomological data from sentinel 
sites that began in January 2014. These data will provide information on the species of malaria 
vectors, infection rates, biting times, and resistance status. Furthermore, the collection of data at 
three times during the year will allow for estimation of seasonal effects.   
 
Proposed activities with FY 2015 funding: ($215,000) 
 
1. Entomological monitoring and capacity building: Support for surveillance of vectors and 
insecticide resistance in each of the four ecological zones, and establishment of a 
permanent insectary and laboratory ($180,000); 
2. Provision of entomological supplies: Provision of supplies for entomological monitoring 
and the insectary ($10,000); and 
3. Technical assistance for entomological capacity building: Support for two technical 
assistance visits from CDC to continue assistance to develop entomological capacity 
($25,000).

Malaria in Pregnancy 
 
NMCP/PMI objectives 
 
In 2013, the NMCP presented their new strategy (2013-2017) with a revised version adopted in 
February 2014. The NMCP and the National Safe Motherhood Program (which oversees ANC 
services nationwide) worked together to develop the national malaria strategy and protocols. The 
strategy contains guidance on standard WHO recommended practices for the prevention of 
malaria in pregnancy including the administration of IPTp with SP under the direct observation 
of an ANC attendant, at four-week intervals, starting in the second trimester, with at least three 
treatments given before delivery, and the provision of an ITN at the time of the first visit. 
Iron/folate is provided free of charge at ANC. Each pregnant woman receives 30 tablets 
(60mg/0.25mg per tablet) per month, taking one per day. Regarding case management of MIP, 
pregnant women who are diagnosed with uncomplicated malaria should receive quinine in the 
first trimester and an ACT in the second and third trimesters. Treatment for those diagnosed with 
severe malaria follow national protocols (see section on Treatment). The strategy also follows 
WHO guidance regarding pregnant women who are HIV positive. 
 
According to the national strategy, pregnant women represent an estimated 4.5% of the 
population, which is the percentage that the NMCP uses to quantify needs for SP and routine 
ITN distribution through ANC.  
 
The NMCP target is that by the end of 2014, 75% of pregnant women will have received at least 
three SP treatments (IPTp3). By 2015, this indicator will be 85%, and will increase to 90% by 
2016. The national strategy defines a target of 80% ITN use by pregnant women (same target in 
all years). In addition, by the end of 2014, 60% of pregnant women will receive an ITN during 
an ANC visit, which increases to 70% in 2015 and 80% by the end of 2016. PMI will work with 
the NMCP and partners to achieve progress towards IPTp uptake and ITN distribution targets. 
 
Progress since PMI was launched  
 
Since the launch of PMI in Guinea in FY 2011, PMI assisted the NMCP to revise its national 
strategy to reflect current WHO recommendations for IPTp uptake. Also, PMI procured and 
distributed nationwide 700,000 SP treatments; trained over 1,530 health facility workers and 
over 655 CHWs in MIP as part of integrated refresher training courses; trained over 60 
supervisors in supportive supervision; and reached over 200,000 people via home visits and 
community-level activities such as group discussions. The trainers for MIP are from the National 
Safe Motherhood Program and work with trainers from the NMCP and other MOH units to form 
the core, integrated training team that PMI has been supporting for all training. Communication 
messages were disseminated throughout PMI target zones promoting IPTp uptake at ANC and 
sleeping under ITNs every night (see BCC section for more details). 
 
The data from the 2012 DHS show that while 85% of pregnant women make at least one ANC 
visit, only 18% receive two or more doses of IPTp (up from 3% in the 2005 DHS). DHS data 
also show that 28% of pregnant women slept under an ITN the previous night, up from 1.4% in 
 25 
 
the 2005 DHS. It should be noted that implementation of IPTp was hampered by stockouts of SP 
for the first two years of PMI in Guinea, and that no ITNs have been available for routine 
distribution for several years, so this number may be a reflection of the ITNs that were 
distributed nationwide for vulnerable groups in 2009, including women of reproductive age and 
children under five years of age. An MIS is planned for June-July 2015 (delayed from 2014 due 
to Ebola), so expectations are high that indicators for both IPTp uptake and ITN use among 
pregnant women will improve given the universal coverage campaign conducted in 2013 and 
increased availability of SP in ANCs. 
 
Progress during the last 12 months 
 
During the last 12 months PMI procured 375,000 SP treatments. This consignment was 
distributed nationwide  rather than uniquely in PMI zones due to the delay in disbursing Global 
Fund resources during the consolidation and revision of the 2006 and 2010 grants, which had 
planned to purchase and distribute SP in their zones. The plan moving forward will be to have 
PMI procure and distribute SP for the entire country, although there are funds in the consolidated 
Global Fund grants to purchase SP, most likely in 2014. This gap in previously planned support 
most likely contributed to stockouts of SP that were recorded in the previous years, which may 
be one of the factors contributing to the low IPTp2 coverage seen in the 2012 DHS data. 
 
PMI has ordered 180,000 ITNs, which will be targeted for distribution through ANC, most likely 
in late 2014 and into 2015. This will cover almost 50% of the need for routine nets for pregnant 
women. ITNs are also on order from the Global Fund and should fill the remaining gap in the 
country. 
 
PMI provided support for training and supervision of ANC workers in IPTp and for 
dissemination of communication messages for increasing knowledge and promoting prevention 
of MIP at the community level. Training materials have been updated and are following the new 
guidelines for IPTp.  
 
Across the PMI target zones, 400 health facility workers and 554 CHWs were trained on malaria 
case management, including MIP. Also, 41health workers from the central, regional, and 
prefectural levels were trained in case management including MIP. Finally, there were over 
50,000 people reached via home visits and community-level activities such as group discussions 
that included messages on MIP.  
 
Commodity gap analysis 
 
With an estimated national population of approximately 12 million and the proportion of 
pregnant women being 4.5%, it is estimated that 562,901 pregnancies could occur in 2016. PMI 
will procure approximately 922,500 treatments of SP to meet approximately 60% of the 
nationwide need. Although the NMCP has stated that they would like PMI to be responsible for 
all SP purchases nationwide as of 2013, there is a plan to have the Global Fund purchase 
approximately 1,368,000 SP treatments in 2014, contributing to 2015 and 2016 needs.

Assumptions: Population growth is estimated at 3.1% and based on 2009 population data. 
Pregnant women are estimated to be approximately 4.5% of the population. Target for ANC 
attendance (i.e., IPTp 3) is 75% in 2014, 85% in 2015 and 90% in 2016. The NMCP bases SP 
needs on 3 doses for each pregnant woman attending ANC. 
 
Plan and justification 
 
PMI will continue to support activities aimed at enhancing the provision of effective MIP 
services in public health facilities in Guinea. To that end, PMI will procure enough SP treatments 
to cover approximately 60% of the estimated needs nationwide, as well as a portion of the ITN 
need for routine distribution during ANC visits (see ITN section). Additionally, PMI will 
continue to support BCC training and messaging to improve the demand for ANC services and 
understanding of the benefits of IPTp among community members and health workers. PMI will 
support laboratory diagnosis and appropriate treatment of malaria to reinforce the 
implementation of MIP services, including training and supervision of IPTp service delivery 
along with other aspects of effective case management, and promotion of ITN use.  
 
Proposed activities with FY 2015 funding: ($120,000) 
 
1. Procure treatments of SP: Procure approximately 922,463 treatments of SP to cover 
about 60% of the needs in Guinea for 2016($115,000); 
2. Procure supplies to ensure consumption of SP at ANC: Procure supplies such as cups 
and water to ensure that SP is taken at the time of ANC visit ($5,000); 
3. Promote BCC for IPTp: Promote ANC clinic attendance and educate pregnant women 
and communities on the benefits of IPTp. This activity will include support for 
community-level approaches, such as training of community-based workers, as well as 
mass media (including local radio stations). Immunization outreach sessions will be used 
as opportunities for educating women. This will be part of a larger integrated BCC 
activity to satisfy needs for case management, ITNs, and IPTp (Costs covered in BCC 
section); 
4. Provide training/refresher training for MIP: Provide training and refresher training for 
public and private health facility midwives and nurses to correctly deliver SP in the 
context of the focused ANC approach. Training will include benchmark assessments, on-
the-job training of the current treatment algorithm, and coaching. Training will be part of 
an integrated training package (Costs covered in Case Management/Diagnosis section); 
and  
 27 
 
5. Supervise health workers in IPTp to improve quality of service: Provide on-site 
supervision for public health facility midwives and nurses to correctly deliver SP in the 
context of the focused ANC approach, and to ensure that available ITNs are given to 
women at their first ANC contact. Supervision will continue to be part of an integrated 
approach for supervision at health facilities (Costs covered in Case 
Management/Diagnosis section). 
 
 
CASE MANAGEMENT 
 
Diagnosis 
 
NMCP/PMI objectives 
 
The national strategic plan and policy guidelines recommend diagnostic confirmation of all 
suspected malaria cases, among all patients, with either microscopy (when available) or an RDT, 
before they are treated. According to the policy, RDTs are provided free of charge and will be 
widely used at public health facilities and by CHWs, while microscopy services incur a fee.  
 
According to Guinea’s health services package, all hospitals and health centers should provide 
microscopy services; however, a Global Fund-financed health facility survey of hospitals and 
health centers in 2010 showed that fewer than half the facilities in Guinea had a microscope 
(approximately 100% of hospitals but only 40% of health centers).13 Microscopes often are not 
functional and health facilities may lack reagents and related laboratory supplies. Data from the 
health facility survey indicated that only 43% of hospitals and health centers had slides, and 19% 
had Giemsa stain. Staff from the NMCP and the National Laboratory, which is part of the 
National Institute of Public Health, are responsible for supervision of microscopy, although no 
comprehensive quality assurance/quality control program has been developed for malaria. PMI 
intends to begin working on this in the future, as the scale-up in training and provision of 
diagnostic materials moves toward nationwide coverage. 
 
The NMCP supports the use of RDTs for malaria diagnosis at all levels of the health care system. 
In addition to ensuring that RDTs are available in health facilities, the NMCP is working toward 
having a continuous supply of RDTs at the community level for use by CHWs. Capacity building 
through training on the use of RDTs and microscopy is part of the NMCP strategy as well as an 
objective of PMI. 
 
Nationwide, there are about 108 laboratory technicians, all of whom are to be trained in 
microscopy and RDT use. There are also approximately 4,784 health facility workers: 2,506 in 
PMI zones and 2,278 in Global Fund zones. There are an estimated 1,895 CHWs (approximately 
five per health facility with 379 facilities in the country; the 21 facilities in Conakry don’t have 
CHWs). The goal is to train them all in RDT use (and overall case management). 
 
The case management training targets for the PMI bilateral project (per the Performance 
Management Plan) is 1,536 health facility workers and 680 CHWs. In addition to receiving RDT 
                                                 
13 This was a nationally-representative survey with a sample of 129 health facilities. 
 28 
 
training, 60 laboratory technicians across the country will be trained in microscopy. The four-
year project includes refresher training for these target groups. 
 
A national supervision plan exists, but a resource gap limits the NMCP's (as well as the regional 
[DRS] and district [DPS] health authorities') ability to conduct effective, comprehensive, and 
regular supervision. Supervision is planned based on a specific guidance document and focuses 
on case management and data quality. The following is a description of the national plan (for 
which resources are not sufficient):  
� Central/National level to regional levels (DRS) – Activities at the national level are led 
by the NMCP and supported by implementing partners –PMI’s malaria bilateral and 
Catholic Relief Services (GF principal recipient). Supervision is scheduled to be 
conducted every six months to 8 DRS. 
� Regional (DRS) to district (DPS) levels – Supervision is organized by DRS and is done 
with implementing partners. Each DRS typically has 3-6 DPS. Supervision is scheduled 
to be conducted every three months to 38 DPS. 
� District (DPS) to Health facilities (604 health posts, 412 health centers, 6 commune 
health centers, 26 prefecture hospitals, 7 regional hospitals, 3 national hospitals) – 
Supervision of health facilities is done by DPS and implementing partners. Supervision is 
scheduled to be conducted every two months. 
 
Progress since PMI was launched 
 
When PMI started in 2011 the country was completely stocked out of RDTs and there were 
almost no functioning microscopes anywhere. Since then, PMI has purchased and distributed 
over 6 million RDTs and purchased 48 microscopes and related supplies (reagents, gloves, 
disposal boxes, and slides). Training targets and activities are summarized in the table below.

PMI has also supported supervision in RDT use at both the health facility and community levels 
(more recently). Eighteen laboratory technicians have been recruited and trained to serve as 
 29 
 
supervisors for the Outreach Training and Support Supervision program. Nine health facilities 
(seven regional hospitals and two national hospitals) have been targeted for Outreach Training 
and Support Supervision visits, which will occur bimonthly throughout 2014. Training and 
supervision activities in diagnostics have just started in the Global Fund zones. 
 
Progress during the last 12 months 
 
During the last 12 months, PMI supported the update of the national malaria strategy and policy 
which includes important revisions on the use of diagnostics to confirm suspected malaria cases 
before treatment, which now follow WHO recommendations. Specifically, all suspected cases of 
malaria must first be tested using either microscopy or an RDT before treatment is administered, 
regardless of the health system level (hospital, health center, health post or community). 
Previously, the strategy and policy did not require biologic confirmation of malaria in order to 
prescribe treatment for children less than five years of age. In support of the new policy, PMI 
procured 5 million RDTs for the entire country. PMI is also in the process of procuring 
microscopes and related laboratory supplies for select health facilities, which will be combined 
with previous PMI and Global Fund microscope procurements to make available 100 
microscopes: 63 from PMI and 37 from Global Fund. This will ensure that each of the 36 
hospitals, nationwide, as well as about 28 health centers will be fully equipped: two microscopes 
per hospital, and one microscope in each of 28 selected health centers. 
 
Building on a PMI-supported rapid laboratory assessment in March 2012, PMI supported the 
evaluation of an additional 19 zonal health facilities (six hospitals, seven health centers and four 
health posts) and found that some facilities do not have a functional microscope, and of the ones 
that did, all the microscopes were in poor condition. All facilities were using RDTs. In one 
facility, the technician did not correctly perform the RDT. The assessment findings were used to 
inform activities including a nationwide training of 18 trainers of laboratory technicians in 
malaria diagnosis, including microscopy maintenance, supply management, and RDT use. 
Additionally, 41 health facility workers were trained in RDT use, and they, in turn, trained 554 
CHWs.  
 
PMI has supported supervision of health workers – including diagnostics for case management – 
at the hospital, health center, and health post levels, as well as CHWs at the community level. 
PMI supported the development of a checklist for supervision, which should be utilized as part of 
an integrated supervision visit, ensuring that malaria diagnostics are performed correctly along 
with other health worker functions. However, the concept of integration has been difficult to 
adopt below the central level, as regional and district level supervisors tend to utilize supervision 
support resources based on the source of the funding, so PMI funds have been used to supervise 
health facility clinicians only on malaria. PMI will try and address this inefficiency in the coming 
year, working with key stakeholders including donors and the MOH. 
 
Finally, PMI supported the development of an RDT utilization sheet that will help CHWs track 
RDT use and better determine when they should request stock replenishment. PMI also 
supported training on quantification in the PMI target zones so that health facility personnel and 
regional warehouse managers understand the process and have the tools for calculating supply 
needs based on use.

Commodity gap analysis 
 
The table below presents RDT needs for 2014, 2015 and 2016, as specified by the gap analysis 
conducted by the NMCP. PMI plans to procure enough RDTs to cover approximately all of the 
total nationwide need in 2014, 63% in 2015, and 72% in 2016.

2015, and 0.9 fevers in 2016) and further adjusted for testing rate by RDT. 
 
Plan and justification 
 
PMI will continue to support the NMCP’s national policy of malaria case management based on 
diagnostic confirmation by supporting RDT use and strengthening microscopy through provision 
of commodities, as well as training and supervision at the health facility and community levels. 
Commodity procurement will be focused nationwide as PMI support transitions to meeting 
existing needs throughout the country. The NMCP also requested that PMI procure the majority 
of the country’s diagnostics commodities. Training and supervision will continue to provide 
long-term, ongoing support to strengthen diagnostic services at all levels of the health care 
system by identifying areas that require improvement and providing on-site feedback and 
technical advice and support to the front-line clinicians and laboratory staff in peripheral health 
facilities. Training and supervision for diagnostics will be integrated with community case 
management as well as other malaria prevention and care activities, and will focus on PMI 
intervention zones as Global Fund provides support for training and supervision in their 
designated zones. One specific component of diagnostic strengthening will be investment in the 
development of a comprehensive quality assurance and quality control system for microscopy 
and RDTs. This will ensure sustainable gains and country capacity building in diagnostic 
practices. 
 
Proposed activities with FY 2015 funding: ($2,765,000) 
 
1. Procure rapid diagnostics tests (RDTs): Procure approximately 3,460,000 RDTs to 
continue scaling up RDT use in health facilities and in communities via CHWs 
($1,800,000); 
2. Procure microscope supplies: Procure reagents, slides, and repair materials for existing 
microscopes in hospitals and health centers ($15,000); 
 31 
 
3. Improved malaria diagnostics: Work with the NMCP and National Laboratory to 
develop and support a comprehensive quality assurance and quality control plan for 
malaria diagnostics at all levels of the health system. This will include refresher training 
for lab technicians (and training on malaria microscopy for new laboratory technicians) 
and regular supervision of microscopy and RDT performance, including systematic 
review of a predetermined number of positive and negative blood smears ($150,000); 
4. Provide training/refresher training in RDT use: Provide refresher training on malaria 
diagnostics, including correct RDT use at all levels of the health care system, to ensure 
adherence to the new national policy of testing all suspect cases. With the new policy 
there is an increased focus on the community level. This will be an integrated RDT/case 
management training ($500,000); and 
5. Supervise health workers and CHWs in RDT use: Provide integrated, regular supervision 
of health workers and CHWs focusing on microscopy and RDT performance. This will 
be integrated RDT/case management supervision. As part of this activity, PMI will work 
with the MOH and other key stakeholders such as the Global Fund, to ensure that 
resources are used to support integrated supervision, and not just malaria ($300,000). 
 
Treatment 
 
NMCP/PMI objectives 
 
The National Malaria Control Strategy follows the WHO guidelines for malaria treatment, which 
requires mandatory confirmation of suspect malaria cases before treatment administration. This 
requirement applies to both forms of malaria (uncomplicated and severe) and at all levels of the 
health system including the community level.  
 
Treatment of uncomplicated malaria 
In Guinea, the first-line ACTs for treatment of uncomplicated malaria are artesunate-
amodiaquine (AS-AQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL). In cases of AS-AQ or AL intolerance, 
side effects, or treatment failure, the patient should be referred to the nearest health facility. Per 
national policy, pregnant women in their first trimester with uncomplicated malaria are to be 
treated with oral quinine; in the second and third trimesters, they are to be treated with AS-AQ 
(or AL). The ACTs are free for adults and children (as are RDTs), but patients have to pay for 
other drugs received, as well as for microscopy tests. 
 
Treatment of severe malaria  
As stated in the national strategy, the first choice for treatment of severe malaria is injectable 
artesunate. Other acceptable treatments include injectable artemether or quinine. The 
management of severe malaria should be carried out in health facilities with the capacity required 
for proper treatment. All cases of severe malaria in pregnant women should be treated with 
parenteral quinine during the first trimester of pregnancy, and artemisinin derivatives or 
parenteral quinine from the second trimester onward. Per national policy, treatment for severe 
malaria is free.  
 
Pre-referral treatment of severe malaria  
 32 
 
All cases of severe malaria seen in the community or at health facilities without the capacity to 
treat severe cases, should receive pre-referral treatment with artemisinin derivatives 
(intramuscularly or suppository) before being referred.  
 
Pre-referral treatment is a relatively new intervention for which national policy and guidance has 
just recently been developed. The use of rectal artesunate by CHWs has been piloted for three 
years before its adoption as national policy in early 2014. In 2009 Medecins sans Frontières 
Switzerland initiated a pilot study of rectal artesunate in the forest region in Gueckedou. The 
national case management strategy for CHWs includes the use of RDTs, recognition of danger 
signs of severe malaria, and pre-referral treatment (with rectal artesunate) of identified severe 
cases. Rectal artesunate was added to the list of drugs that CHWs are permitted to use and it is 
now part of CHW routine training. Appropriate case management tools, including algorithms, 
protocols, IEC material, and necessary commodities will be provided to CHWs and they will be 
supervised by health facility staff.  
 
Training and supervision of clinical staff 
All health providers are to be trained in the diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated and severe 
malaria cases. Training will be based on the revised and recently distributed training manuals for 
health providers on case management and malaria in pregnancy, including new algorithms for 
case management. Health workers, including CHWs, will be retrained every two years on 
appropriate case management, including for pre-referral of severe cases, and supervised regularly 
according to the national supervision strategy. 
 
Progress since PMI was launched 
 
PMI has provided ACT treatments for all age groups in response to stockouts in health facilities 
in both PMI and Global Fund zones. PMI procured and distributed injectable quinine and 
injectable artesunate for the treatment of severe cases. PMI also developed a data collection form 
which allowed for a better quantification of needs at the facility level. Commodity distributions 
have served as an opportunity to introduce the new monthly malaria reporting template and 
process. Other key activities supported by PMI have included the introduction of a new 
medication (injectable artesunate) for the treatment of severe malaria and case management 
training of 1,329 health workers and CHWs. 
 
In order to improve the population’s knowledge on malaria treatment, PMI in collaboration with 
the NMCP produced and disseminated 20,000 pamphlets in the 151 health centers covered by  
PMI, and produced and disseminated one malaria prevention TV spot in French and local 
languages. PMI trained members of health and hygiene committees and facilitators to conduct 
group discussions and mass awareness talks on the prevention and treatment of malaria. This 
activity resulted in 1,884 group discussions and mass sensitizations during which 75,633 people 
were reached, including 42,891 women. During these discussions, CHW and NGO facilitators 
emphasized key messages to the population including the importance of seeking health care in 
case of fever, and the availability of free malaria testing and treatment. 
 
Progress during the last 12 months 
 
 33 
 
PMI and partners, including the NMCP, have introduced monthly reporting forms and tools to 
ensure a more consistent flow of information from the health facility to the district level, and up 
to the central level. This approach has begun in the PMI zones and has helped improve 
completion of monthly reporting to the NMCP from 30% to over 80% in these facilities. In 
theory, health facilities are re-supplied with malaria products after sending monthly reports 
detailing the number of medicines given to patients. This approach is still fairly new in the PMI 
zones and the hope is that the data will allow the NMCP and MOH to plan for appropriate 
procurement and distribution of products to the local level.  
 
In the last year, PMI has procured approximately 2 million ACTs for uncomplicated malaria and 
130,000 treatments of injectable artesunate for severe malaria cases. PMI also trained 727 health 
providers in case management; the protocols have been updated, validated and disseminated.

Assumptions: Population growth is estimated at 3.1% and based on 2009 population data. 
Assumptions for the total artesunate suppository needs are based on the number of suspect 
malaria cases expected to seek care at the community level (6% in 2014, 8% in 2015, 10% in 
2016). Of these, 3% are assumed to be severe cases needing pre-referral treatment and 100% of 
those in need are expected to get pre-referral treatment. 
 
Plan and justification  
 
PMI will now support the entire country with commodity procurement to meet existing needs 
rather than differentiating between zones. This will reduce stockouts of commodities and 
increase access to treatment. 
 
PMI will continue to procure ACTs for all age groups to support appropriate treatment based on 
confirmed diagnosis. To facilitate the distribution of ACTs, PMI will procure and deliver to the 
lowest level necessary to ensure that ACTs reach beneficiaries. Additionally, PMI will procure 
injectable artesunate, injectable artemether, and rectal artesunate to help cover needs for severe 
malaria cases. 
 
PMI plans to support integrated BCC activities to promote appropriate treatment-seeking 
behavior among community members. Human capacity building will continue to be a part of this 
intervention through clinical and refresher training in malaria case management for all age 
groups and vulnerable populations, and supervision of health workers and CHWs. The health 
facility survey planned for later this year will provide an assessment of malaria treatment 
practices in health facilities. 
 
PMI will work with partners to ensure that data being gathered are analyzed and used for making 
decisions and to better assess needs for supplies, case detection, and treatment at the community 
level. Implementation of all case management activities, including scale up of pre-referral 
treatment with rectal artesunate, will be done in coordination and collaboration with the Global 
Fund. The NMCP coordinates implementing partners (for PMI and Global Fund) to ensure 
 35 
 
harmonized training for case management and CHWs throughout the country. Historically, PMI 
started the training activities in the country, and now Catholic Relief Services (Global Fund’s 
principal recipient) is using the same national pool of trainers and training material in the rest of 
the country. There is a general agreement between PMI and Global Fund to ensure that 
commodities and other technical resources are shared if and wherever gaps may be identified. 
This was recently put into practice when the need to ensure that both donors were procuring the 
same RDT (on which case management training had been based) became clear. The need to 
coordinate donor efforts and implementing partner activities has been a challenge for the national 
program in the past but as PMI has scaled up its presence, the NMCP has become better 
organized, and communication between PMI and Global Fund has become more regular, this 
issue has improved. 
 
Proposed activities with FY 2015 Funding: ($1,697,500) 
 
1. Procure ACTs: PMI will procure and distribute approximately 1,735,000 
ACTs($830,000); 
2. Procure injectable artesunate: PMI will procure and distribute 76,100 treatments of 
injectable artesunate for severe malaria ($679,500); 
3. Procure injectable artemether: PMI will procure and distribute 20,000 treatments of 
injectable artemether ($31,000); 
4. Procure rectal artesunate: PMI will procure and distribute 15,500 rectal artesunate 
treatments to be used by CHWs for pre-referral purposes ($7,000); 
5. Behavior Change Communication for case management: Integrated BCC and education 
activities for communities to improve behaviors related to malaria prevention and 
treatment. Activities will include use of LLINs and IPTp, and appropriate care seeking 
behaviors, particularly at the community level through use of CHWs. Particular emphasis 
will be placed on prompt care-seeking for fever and other symptoms of malaria. (Cost 
covered under BCC section); 
6. Clinical training/refresher training in malaria case management: Training in malaria 
case management including RDT use, treatment, and malaria in pregnancy for health 
workers at hospitals, health centers, and health posts who have not been trained using 
previous years funds. Training of CHWs not yet trained in RDT use, treatment of 
uncomplicated malaria, and referral for patients with severe malaria, as well as referral of 
pregnant women to ANC. Continue implementation of a comprehensive refresher 
training schedule for health workers and CHWs who have already received initial 
training. (Cost covered under Case Management/Diagnostics section); 
7. Supervision of health workers and CHWs: Enhance clinical supervision at all levels of the 
health care system, including hospitals, health centers, health posts, and CHWs. District 
Health Team staff (Département Préfectoral de Santé) and regional health team staff 
(Département Régional de Santé) will be actively involved in supervision activities, 
along with health center staff for supervision of CHWs. Supervision visits will include 
observation of patient consultations and feedback to providers. (Cost covered under Case 
Management/Diagnostics section); and 
8. Community case management: Support the scale-up of community case management in 
PMI target areas, including management and logistic costs, and support for data 
management, as well as refresher training of 650 CHWs. ($150,000).

Pharmaceutical Management 
 
NMCP/PMI objectives 
 
The objective set forth in the updated national strategic plan for the pharmaceutical system is to 
provide treatment to 100% of patients. This overall objective implies supplying quality drugs to 
health facilities nationwide in sufficient quantities and on a regular basis.  
 
As the main institution in charge of implementing the GOG policy in the pharmaceutical sector, 
the central medical store (Pharmacie Central de Guinée-PCG) was created in 1992 by the GOG 
to supply the health facilities nationwide with quality drugs in appropriate quantities and in a 
timely manner. PCG operates under the administrative oversight of the National Directorate of 
Pharmacies and Laboratories (DNPL). PCG has established pharmaceutical depots in five of the 
eight regions in Guinea. This institution has also played a role as sub-recipient of Global Fund 
grants to procure drugs for the three priority diseases (HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria). Despite 
its storage capacity of 4,455 square meters across the country, 3,815 of which are available in 
Conakry, PCG continues to face important challenges in fulfilling its responsibilities as the major 
supply chain and distribution entity. 
 
The private pharmaceutical sector is growing fast with more than 387 private pharmacies 
nationwide of which about 70% are located in Conakry. A multitude of non-registered businesses 
also sell pharmaceutical products, with many of them serving as the only commercial outlet in a 
particular rural area. Those pharmacies sell a wide range of antimalarial drugs, including both 
branded and generic drugs.  
 
Progress since the launch of PMI 
 
Since its launch in FY 2011, PMI has clearly identified the PCG as the main institution to 
strengthen in order to ensure a smooth distribution of drugs to end users. To assist the 
pharmaceutical system (mainly PCG and the DNPL meeting the challenges of timely distribution 
of quality drugs to the health facilities), PMI has mandated its main partners in pharmaceutical 
system strengthening with the objective of reinforcing each of the critical functions of these 
entities (storage, distribution, logistic management information system, and development and 
enforcement of policies and regulations).  
 
According to the national pharmaceutical policy, the national essential drugs list should be 
revised every two years, but that is not being done on a regular basis. PMI is supporting the 
DNPL to systematize the process of revising the list on a regular basis. 
 
During the past two years, implementation of reforms recommended by PMI partners has been 
very slow, which continues to negatively reflect on drugs distribution to health service delivery 
points. The recommendations of the audit of the supply chain conducted in 2012 by the EU, 
mostly focusing on financial management of the PCG, are yet to be implemented. This has led to 
recurrent stockouts of malaria commodities, not only in PMI-supported prefectures, but also in 
Global Fund-supported prefectures.  
 37 
 
 
Progress during the last 12 months 
 
During the past twelve months, PMI, in collaboration with the NMCP, supported the emergency 
distribution of malaria commodities, mainly ACT drugs in the entire country in March and July 
2013. PMI also assisted with establishing a data collection and reporting system from health 
facilities up to the prefecture and the national level to facilitate decision-making. As a result, 
health facilities in PMI zones are currently reporting pharmaceutical management and 
epidemiological and commodities data on a monthly basis. To facilitate information sharing, 
lessons learned and sharing of experience, PMI’s partners launched the first quarterly review 
meeting in Conakry in March 2013. In health districts supported by PMI, laptop computers and 
internet access keys were provided to data managers to facilitate data compilation, processing 
and transmission to the upper level of the health system. To motivate this process and ensure 
quality of data, a data quality competition has been instituted for outstanding performing 
districts, enabling them to gain equipment such as laptop computers, printers, and other useful 
materials.      
 
To assist with alleviating obstacles and to facilitate advocacy for implementing reforms 
recommended both by the EU audit and PMI assessment, PMI has increased the funding 
allocated to strengthening the supply chain and the pharmaceutical system. A seasoned supply 
chain expert has been recruited to lead PMI’s efforts to strengthen the supply chain and the 
pharmaceutical system in Guinea. In the meantime and in order to ensure regular procurement, 
storage, and timely distribution of commodities, PMI has also increased funding to its partner in 
charge of commodities procurement to recruit an international expert to manage the temporary 
distribution of commodities while the two partners (DELIVER and SIAPS) will jointly work to 
assist PCG and the DNPL to conduct necessary reforms. PMI partners will evaluate the current 
work plan designed to assist both the PCG and the DNPL at the end of this calendar year to 
determine future steps towards improving the governance of the pharmaceutical sector and 
progressively enable PCG to adequately perform its function of storage and distribution of 
commodities.  
 
PMI currently supports the DNPL in the development of an implementation plan for Guinea’s 
national pharmaceutical policy. This work has been initiated and will continue this year through 
a series of development and validation meetings.  
 
During the past 12 months, two end-use verification surveys (EUV) were conducted; the results 
of the first EUV were disseminated during the quarterly data review meetings to major 
stakeholders (see M&E section for details). The next EUV is scheduled for June 2014 and will 
cover the entire country, including the 19 prefectures supported by the Global Fund. 
 
PMI and its partners will concentrate on implementing a joint work plan discussed with PCG and 
the DNPL. Activities will focus on reforming the legal and regulatory frameworks of the 
pharmaceutical sector, including revising the criteria for drugs registration and updating the 
essential drugs list. PMI will also work with PCG to conform to WHO and other international 
norms and standards for storing commodities not only at the central warehouse, but also at 
regional warehouses in Labe and Boke. PMI will train 400 health workers at the periphery on 
 38 
 
good practices of pharmaceutical management. Support will also be provided to strengthen the 
control functions of the DNPL through the definition of appropriate tools to enable 
pharmaceutical inspectors to better perform their duties. 
 
PMI will assist the MOH to establish a national commodities quantification committee, building 
on the current efforts to collect consumption data. Using malaria as an entry point to this effort, 
PMI will provide steady technical assistance to the MOH to establish a malaria commodities 
quantification committee. Efforts to quantify these commodities, using data and improved 
forecasting, will enable sharing and documentation of lessons learned in order to expand the 
experience to other health commodities.  
 
Plan and justification 
 
With FY 2015 funding, PMI will continue and increase its support to the supply chain and the 
pharmaceutical sector. PMI support will mainly focus on improving the logistic management 
information system.  
 
Efforts will also continue, in collaboration with PCG and the DNPL, to strengthen the 
pharmaceutical sector through supporting reforms to enable the supply chain to perform its core 
duties of storing and distributing commodities on a regular basis to health facilities and in 
accordance with international norms and standards. The essential drugs list will be updated with 
PMI support and will be closely monitored by the DNPL. PMI will also strengthen the drugs 
regulatory capacity of the DNPL to improve the control over the pharmaceutical sector by well-
trained staff.  Finally, support to pharmaceutical supplies management will be the centerpiece of 
PMI support in the coming year to significantly reduce recurrent drugs stockouts at health 
facility and community levels.  
 
Proposed activities with FY 2015 funding: ($1,400,000) 
 
1. Improving logistic management information systems: Continue support to strengthen the 
logistic management information systems to enable the pharmaceutical system to collect, 
compile, and process consumption data throughout the health system in order to improve 
the forecasting, the procurement, and the distribution of commodities. This activity 
includes procurement of computers, support for internet connectivity, and capacity 
building for quantification at the central level (PCG, DNPL), as well as at the regional, 
prefecture, and district levels ($100,000);  
2. Pharmaceutical systems reform: Continue to support the reform of regulations governing 
the supply chain management and the pharmaceutical system, including the 
implementation of the recommendations of the audit performed by the EU. Reforms are 
required not only at the central level but also to the periphery in how stocks are managed. 
PMI’s support of the EU audit findings and recommendations will be linked to this 
activity ($250,000);  
3. Improve drug regulatory capacity: Continue to support improvement of the regulatory 
and oversight capacities of the DNPL, revision of national list of essential drugs, and 
enhanced control of compliance to the pharmaceutical policy and regulations by PCG and 
the private pharmacies network. Capacity building of the pharmaceutical system will 
 39 
 
include improving capacity to combat counterfeit drugs and the illicit sale of drugs. 
($250,000);  
4. Management of pharmaceutical supplies:  Manage the distribution of PMI commodities 
down to the health facility level, including warehousing, transportation, storage and 
distribution ($700,000); and, 
5. Strengthening of the DNLP and the national laboratory for drug quality testing and 
monitoring: Review and revise the national policy on drug quality and identify priority 
activities such as the implementation of quality surveillance through support to the PCG 
and the DNLP to improve sampling strategies with appropriate techniques. This activity 
will also review registration. In addition to strengthening testing processes, this activity 
supports the MOH to review importation and registration policies. Malaria funds will 
supplement MCH and RH/FP funds for a comprehensive laboratory and drug quality 
strengthening ($100,000). 
 
MONITORING & EVALUATION 
 
NMCP/PMI objectives 
 
M&E is a key component of Guinea’s malaria program, and the NMCP recognizes the 
importance of having a strong M&E strategy to inform programmatic interventions and measure 
outcomes and impact. The NMCP finalized its national M&E plan along with the national 
strategy in February 2014; both documents cover the period 2013-2017. 
 
The new plan identifies indicators, targets, and data sources and emphasizes data collection, data 
quality assurance, and dissemination and use of data.14 Specific M&E priorities reflected in the 
updated plan include revising and maintaining the national malaria database, including the health 
management and information system (HMIS) and supervision data; creating and disseminating 
malaria bulletins; building M&E capacity at regional and district levels; and strengthening 
relationships with partners collecting malaria data, including HMIS and the Integrated Disease 
Surveillance and Response system. A technical committee for M&E does exist at the national 
level, but has only just begun efforts to convene regularly and consistently. As M&E activities 
intensify, the NMCP and all key stakeholders, including PMI, will increase efforts to consistently 
convene the committee and ensure collaboration, coordination, and technical support for data 
collection activities. PMI’s bilateral partner has a key role in supporting the NMCP in this 
function. 
 
Currently, the following data sources collect malaria data in Guinea: 
� HMIS: The NMCP and HMIS have a strong collaboration, as evidenced by the ease with 
which the NMCP implemented a new monthly reporting tool to collect malaria 
commodity and epidemiological data on the same form. The MOH unit responsible for 
the HMIS was an active and supportive participant in this effort. The annual HMIS report 
is not perceived as a timely or valid data source (the most recent report is from 2011), and 
the new monthly malaria report is currently providing key malaria data with 80% 
reporting completion in the zones that have been targeted for training and supervision by 
                                                 
14 A full indicator table is available in Annex 6 of the National Strategic Plan. 
 40 
 
PMI. Revised indicators for the monthly reporting include the number of suspect cases 
and confirmed cases.  
� Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response system: While potentially a timelier tool 
for routine malaria data (reporting weekly on the number of clinical and confirmed 
malaria cases, among other notifiable diseases), reporting completeness and accuracy are 
limited. More information is needed on the status and functionality of this system. 
� Household surveys: Guinea has implemented a DHS in 2005, a MICS in 2007, and 
Global Fund-supported national coverage surveys conducted in 2009 and 2010 to 
measure population coverage with basic interventions (ITNs, IPTp, and ACTs), as well as 
a health facility component assessing commodity availability and case management 
practices.15 The 2012 DHS provides follow-up estimates for key malaria indicators, as 
well as the first national estimates of malaria parasitemia. A MIS is planned for 2015 
(postponed from 2014 due to the Ebola outbreak) and the next DHS will be implemented 
in 2017. The Global Fund is planning to support a post-ITN campaign survey by the end 
of 2014 to provide coverage estimates for ITN ownership and use since the MIS will be 
postponed; this survey, however, is now being reconsidered as the Ebola outbreak 
continues. A Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) survey will be implemented in 
September 2014 to provide formative data on malaria-related behaviors including net use 
and treatment-seeking practices. This survey will be complemented by a more in-depth 
qualitative barrier analysis designed to identify positive deviants contributing to uptake of 
key malaria behaviors. 
� 
Health facility surveys: PMI had planned to support a national malaria health facility 
survey in August/September 2014 to get nationally representative data on the provision of 
malaria case management services in Guinea’s health facilities. When PMI learned that 
the Global Fund, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations, and WHO were 
supporting a Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) survey to be 
conducted in the same quarter, PMI decided to forgo a potentially duplicative data 
collection activity in favor of leveraging existing resources and efforts. Though not a 
malaria-specific survey, the SARA includes indicators on health facility readiness to 
provide malaria services, including health worker training, supervision, and malaria 
commodity availability; the SARA also includes a larger sample size (~170 facilities). In 
order to get some measure of health worker adherence to national malaria case 
management guidelines, a current information gap for the national program, the survey 
committee is considering piloting a “Malaria Module,” consisting of a patient exit 
interview, in a subset of the sampled facilities. These data collection activities are being 
closely coordinated with the EUV implementers to ensure complementary data capture. 
[Update: Implementation of the SARA has been postponed indefinitely due to the 
ongoing Ebola outbreak.]To date, three EUV surveys have been implemented. With a 
shift in coverage from “PMI target zones” to a national scale, the EUV will now be 
implemented semi-annually rather than quarterly. It continues to provide data on 
commodity availability and case management based on a convenience sample of health 
facilities on a regular basis.  
                                                 
15 The 2005 DHS data are available, but the 2007 MICS results are not maintained by UNICEF headquarters; they 
may be available in country. The reports from the 2009 and 2010 Global Fund surveys are available.

Progress since PMI was launched 
 
Routine data and HMIS strengthening: The Bureau de Statistiques et de Développement and the 
NMCP have collaborated, with the support of PMI, to revise monthly malaria reporting to 
capture key epidemiological and stock management data on one form. The new form includes 
the following indicators: number of suspect malaria cases, cases tested (microscopy and RDT), 
cases confirmed positive (microscopy and RDT), cases treated with ACT, severe cases treated 
with ACT, cases referred, and deceased. Numbers are reported for the health facility, as well as 
by CHWs. Data are also included from ANC including total women seen in ANC, number 
receiving first dose of SP, number receiving at least three doses of SP, and number of women 
sensitized at ANC. Health workers in the PMI target zones have been trained on reporting and 
 42 
 
are currently using the form; training and implementation has yet to be completed in the rest of 
the country.  
 
2012 DHS: The 2012 DHS was implemented from June-October 2012 and provided the first 
nationally representative estimates of malaria parasitemia. Because it was implemented in the 
rainy season, these estimates will be comparable to the MIS, which is now planned for June/July 
2015. Additionally, the DHS provides important baseline measures for ITN coverage and use 
because it was implemented prior to the 2013 mass ITN distribution campaign. A Global Fund-
financed household coverage survey will provide important post-campaign coverage and use 
estimates in 2014, but may also be postponed due to the Ebola crisis. 
 
EUV Survey: Four EUV surveys have been conducted to date: January 2013, April 2013, 
September 2013, and July 2014. The first survey found relatively high levels of ACT stockouts 
in the previous three months (50-100% of facilities sampled), but showed better results for ACT 
stocks on the day of the survey due to a recent PMI emergency procurement and distribution. 
Additional results showed that only 36% of staff was trained in case management; roughly half 
of all malaria cases were diagnosed based on clinical symptoms alone; and one-third of these 
cases did not receive an appropriate antimalarial. The second survey, conducted in April 2013, 
showed better results for ACT stocks due to additional PMI distributions. However, RDTs were 
still not widely available in facilities, resulting in clinical diagnosis for cases. The survey 
conducted in September 2013 showed improvement in stock availability, but suggested that there 
are still considerable gaps in case management practices (see below for details).[Results of the 
July 2014 survey are not available at the time of writing.] 
 
Therapeutic Efficacy Studies: Researchers at the Maferinyah Research and Training Center have 
conducted a therapeutic efficacy study for Guinea’s first-line ACT, AS-AQ, with data collection 
from 2011-2012. The study followed the WHO protocol, used a 28-day follow-up period, and 
was funded by the European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership. Unpublished 
results show 97% efficacy for AS-AQ. The Maferinyah Research and Training Center is also 
conducting a three-arm clinical trial of artesunate-pyronaridine, artesunate-piperaquine, and AS-
AQ. The Maferinyah researchers have also begun a study aimed at examining the seasonal 
burden of malaria (in low transmission and high transmission seasons) in the four different 
climatic zones (low-lying, middle, high, and forested). The data collection will include 
entomological parameters, as well as individuals’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to 
malaria prevention and treatment. 
 
Progress during the last 12 months 
 
With the introduction of the new monthly malaria reporting form and accompanying health 
worker training, completion rates for monthly reporting in the areas supported by PMI have 
reached 80%. Quarterly regional meetings in Conakry, Boke, and Labe have provided an 
opportunity for key persons from the health facility, district, regional, and national levels to 
discuss progress and challenges with the new reporting system, common data quality issues, and 
ideas for data use at lower levels. Practical sessions focused on presentation of epidemiological 
and pharmaceutical management data. Awards (laptops, printers, and scanners) were presented to 
the top-performing districts for reporting. These quarterly meetings will continue to support 
 43 
 
routine data collection and reporting, encourage data quality improvements, and provide 
technical assistance for data use.    
 
The MIS was originally planned for 2014 to include data collection during the peak transmission 
months of June-July. An in-country steering group, with technical assistance from the partner 
implementing the survey, had worked to develop the timeline, sampling strategy, and 
questionnaire. The recent Ebola outbreak, identified in March 2014, prompted stakeholders and 
the NMCP to reconsider the survey timeline. With the main concerns around risk to data 
collectors and community perceptions of the data collection – particularly for the blood draws 
required for biomarkers – the potential for abnormally high refusal rates and poor data quality, in 
addition to safety concerns, were too high to justify continuing with the survey in 2014. The MIS 
steering committee decided to postpone the survey to high-transmission season in 2015 
(June/July).  
 
The EUV surveys continue to provide useful data on commodities and case management that are 
well-received by the NMCP. The most recent survey, for which results are available, conducted 
in September 2013, showed improved stock availability due to a recent commodity distribution. 
This was the first large distribution of RDTs to health facilities and testing rates were improved 
with 50% of malaria cases tested with an RDT. However, approximately one-third of cases still 
received a clinical diagnosis and 23% of cases did not receive the appropriate treatment. The first 
three EUV surveys focused on the PMI target zones, but future surveys, including the one 
implemented in July 2014, will be national in scope with slightly reduced frequency (twice per 
year). 
 
Over the past year, there have been important planning discussions for future data collection 
activities including the health facility-based SARA survey, LLIN monitoring for nets distributed 
during the mass campaign, and therapeutic efficacy studies for the first-line ACT to be 
conducted in four sites in the country. It is clear that there is a need to focus on coordination 
among partners for these activities to ensure resources are maximized and to avoid duplication of 
efforts. 
 
Plan and justification 
 
In its fifth year of implementation, PMI will continue to collaborate with the NMCP, donors, and 
other stakeholders to support M&E for Guinea’s national strategic plan. With the 2012 DHS, key 
malaria baseline indicators for intervention coverage and impact (including parasitemia) are 
available. The 2015 MIS will provide essential interim measures for progress. PMI will consider 
funding needed for the 2017 DHS in the FY 2016 MOP. The SARA survey that will be 
implemented in late2014 (or 2015, depending upon resolution of the Ebola crisis) will provide 
nationally representative data on health facility readiness to provide needed malaria services, and 
potentially some data on malaria case management practices as well (this will depend on final 
decisions regarding piloting the Malaria Module). A malaria health facility survey in 2016 will 
assess progress in case management and identify if and where gaps remain. PMI will continue 
data collection on commodity availability through the EUV survey to provide rapidly available 
and actionable information for decision makers. 
 
 44 
 
To complement the data collected through EUV surveys and the SARA, a health facility-based 
surveillance system will continue to provide longitudinal data to monitor trends in malaria 
burden at a selection of health facilities. The surveillance system will be initiated in the coming 
year, most likely in the same catchment areas as the four existing entomological surveillance 
sites to triangulate data and maximize opportunities for technical support. To ensure adequate 
supervision in the first phases, implementation will start with one site in or near Maferinyah 
(located about 1.5 hours from Conakry) where an enhanced entomological monitoring activity 
will also be launched this year. New sites (up to four) will be added throughout the year only 
when existing sites are able to demonstrate and maintain a minimum level of data quality and 
performance. Assuming successful implementation in the first year, the second year may include 
expansion to achieve wider geographic coverage with the same resource input. Guinea will look 
to other control programs that have successfully established malaria surveillance (e.g., Senegal, 
Uganda, Zanzibar) to inform implementation.  
 
While quality-controlled data are collected at select surveillance sites, PMI will continue to 
support routine system strengthening. USAID has funded a national assessment of the HMIS 
which has just been finalized. Results were shared at a stakeholders meeting in June 2014 and 
the report will be the foundation for the development of a strategic plan for routine system 
strengthening. PMI will contribute to the cross-cutting United States government efforts to 
strengthen the HMIS and advocate for malaria needs within this broader stakeholder effort. We 
will use the action-planning process (which will be MOH-led) to identify the key areas where 
PMI can have impact for its investment. But we do acknowledge that coordination across MOH 
disease programs, donors, and implementing partners is a challenge that will take time. Until the 
action-planning process is in place and a clear strategy begins to emerge, PMI will use existing 
routine system strengthening funds to meet immediate needs that have been identified by the 
malaria program; printing registers has emerged as a particular priority based on preliminary 
results from the most recent EUV (data collected in July 2014) that indicated printed materials 
were in short supply in the health facilities assessed. Additional areas of focus in the future may 
include reporting in the private sector and community levels, dissemination of national malaria 
bulletins, and technical assistance for data use at various levels (from health facility to national 
level).  
 
PMI will also support standard monitoring activities, including LLIN monitoring, and 
therapeutic efficacy monitoring. These activities will be initiated in the coming year per PMI 
guidance and continue in the next fiscal year.  
 
Proposed activities with FY 2015 funding: ($862,500) 
 
1. EUV survey: The EUV survey will continue to be implemented to monitor the 
availability and use of key malaria control commodities at the health facility level on a 
national scale. Improved logistics management is directly related to the health system’s 
ability to provide effective case management for malaria ($150,000); 
2. Health facility survey: This activity will assess provision of malaria case management 
services in health facilities. Specific dimensions include health facility readiness to 
provide services, health worker training and supervision, and health worker performance. 
 45 
 
The survey protocol will be identical to the one implemented in 2013 to serve as a 
follow-up data point and assess progress over a two-year period ($200,000); 
3. Health facility-based surveillance: An epidemiological surveillance system will continue 
to provide longitudinal data on seasonal trends in malaria cases at a selection of health 
facilities. These sites will be linked to the existing entomological monitoring sites. 
Ideally, the geographic coverage of the surveillance system will expand as the sites 
become established ($200,000); 
4. ITN monitoring: Prospective ITN monitoring, beginning with the next scheduled mass 
LLIN campaign distribution in May 2016, will provide data on: 1) net survivorship and 
physical integrity; 2) bioefficacy of insecticides; and 3) insecticidal content. Funds are 
meant to cover the first year of data collection (baseline and 6 months) ($100,000); 
5. Therapeutic efficacy monitoring: Efficacy monitoring of Guinea’s first-line ACT will 
take place in four sites every two years (two sites in one year and the remaining two sites 
the following year). The activity will follow WHO’s standard protocol. Funds are meant 
to cover monitoring activities in two sites ($100,000); 
6. Routine system strengthening: Routine system strengthening activities will continue to 
build upon progress made in M&E training at the district, regional, and national levels, 
but will be coordinated with a broader health sector effort to strengthen the HMIS. This 
effort, based on a USAID-funded HMIS assessment, will begin with development of a 
strategic plan. PMI will support this strategic plan by identifying priority activities most 
relevant to the malaria program. Activities will focus on continuing to ensure the quality 
of malaria data (including completeness, timeliness, and accuracy) while maximizing 
data use for decision-making and strengthening the system across health sectors. Specific 
activities with measurable objectives will be identified based on development of the 
strategic plan for HMIS strengthening ($87,500); and 
7. Technical assistance for M&E: Support for two M&E visits will provide technical 
assistance for ongoing M&E activities including health facility-based surveillance, 
routine system strengthening, and therapeutic efficacy monitoring. The country team and 
USAID mission will help define the priority objectives for the TDYs ($25,000). 
 
OPERATIONAL RESEARCH 
 
PMI has not funded any operational research projects in Guinea to date, and the team does not 
propose any new projects in FY 2015. 
 
 
BEHAVIOR CHANGE COMMUNICATION 
 
NMCP/PMI objectives 
 
 46 
 
In the updated national strategic plan, the NMCP highlights the important role of BCC across 
interventions by specifying an objective related to adoption of target behaviors for malaria 
control and prevention. The first target for the objective is to develop and disseminate a 
coordinated communication plan for all relevant partners in Guinea. The strategy also highlights 
the important role of a partnership to coordinate BCC messages, tools, and processes, including 
pre-testing, validation, and distribution of support materials. 
 
The NMCP developed a communication plan in 2009, which was revised with PMI support in 
March 2012 (to cover the period 2012-2015). The new plan emphasizes comprehensive 
communication activities based on formative research, including interpersonal and mass media 
approaches, supported through training and educational materials and appropriately monitored 
and evaluated. It also identifies key behaviors and describes challenges, barriers, and 
opportunities for adoption of those behaviors.  
 
A technical committee for BCC has not yet been formally convened, but this is part of the PMI 
bilateral project’s work plan for the next quarter. This group will be central to ensuring 
consistent messaging, harmonizing training approaches, and implementing activities in a 
complementary way. In addition to PMI, the Global Fund provides support for BCC activities 
related to malaria prevention and case management. PMI is shifting towards national coverage 
for many activities (e.g., commodity procurement, pharmaceutical management, M&E), but will 
continue to focus on the “PMI target zones” for implementation of BCC activities.  
 
Progress since PMI was launched 
 
PMI progress on BCC to date has included revision of the NMCP’s national communication plan 
and training manual used by animators for BCC techniques related to malaria prevention and 
treatment. Case management training for health workers and CHWs has included a BCC 
component and CHWs are given job aid posters and story boards to conduct sensitization 
sessions on malaria prevention and treatment in their communities. The revised national 
communication plan, training materials, and tools are used not only in the PMI target areas, but 
also by the Global Fund implementers in the remaining areas of the country. PMI has also 
supported training of NGO animators on BCC related to malaria prevention, and supported Peace 
Corps volunteers to work with local NGOs on implementing malaria BCC activities in the region 
of Boke and Conakry.  
 
Early PMI-supported activities for BCC primarily focused on increasing ANC attendance and 
IPTp 2 uptake, as well as increasing early care seeking for fever. These PMI activities were part 
of an integrated mechanism for family and child health in the PMI zones, and included both 
interpersonal communication through peer discussion groups, as well as mass media through 
radio, television, and pamphlet distribution. The PMI BCC implementing partner had a relatively 
short timeframe in which to carry out its activities, and no evaluation was conducted to assess 
outcomes or impact of the activities beyond the number reached through interpersonal 
communications. With the new PMI bilateral program, BCC has focused almost exclusively on 
the LLIN universal coverage campaign and is now expanding its scope to also focus on case 
management and malaria in pregnancy.  
 
 47 
 
Progress during the last 12 months 
 
BCC activities focused heavily on the LLIN distribution in the PMI target zones, including 
messaging for the distribution itself, proper care and use of nets, and household hang-up visits. 
Together with the steering committee for the distribution campaign, the PMI partner harmonized 
key messages for the campaign using a checklist of communication messages provided to each 
team of enumerators which included a social mobilization agent. The campaign slogan was, “The 
entire family, every night, all year, let’s sleep under mosquito nets!” Communication strategies 
included a mix of mass media: SMS, TV, and radio including round table discussions; mid-
media: theater troupes, concerts, and banners at special events; and interpersonal 
communications: household visits for enumeration and post-distribution hang-up. A total of 
3,849 personnel were trained on social mobilization for the campaign. Post-campaign hang-up 
teams reached 346,232 households, representing 77% of the 451,201 households that received a 
net during the campaign.16 Though the Conakry distribution has not yet taken place due to the 
Ebola outbreak, enumeration activities, including BCC for net use, has already reached 690,609 
people. 
 
In addition to nets, the PMI project continued the work of the previous implementing partner by 
training 41 health workers (public health facilities) and 554 CHWs in the regions of Boke, 
Kindia and Labe on case management guidelines and BCC. The CHWs were supplied with an 
initial stock of commodities, BCC sensitization materials, and management tools. Additionally, 
the project trained 53 NGO animators on BCC related to malaria prevention and treatment. 
 
The partner plans to measure a selection of outcome indicators based on the new (2014) RBM 
Malaria BCC Indicators Reference Guide. Key BCC indicators are listed below but because 
some of them have only recently been standardized, the DHS 2012 may not have included some 
of them. The KAP and Health Facility Survey (HFS) data should be available in calendar year 
2015:

event coverage, 4 articles (newspapers and online), 11 round-tables  by community radios, and 2 interactive 
broadcasts

Plan and justification 
 
PMI will continue to support the NMCP’s communication plan with implementation of BCC 
activities in the PMI target zones reflecting NMCP priorities and national policies, including ITN 
use, ANC attendance and IPTp uptake, and case management, including RDT and ACT use. 
Proposed activities will continue to reflect a mix of interpersonal communication approaches and 
mass media. 
 
PMI plans to conduct a KAP survey by August 2014. The purpose of the survey is to gather 
information on the perceptions, knowledge levels, behaviors, social and economic barriers, and

 49 
 
behavior determinants of target populations, especially pregnant women and young children, to 
understand factors underlying low uptake and use of LLINs and malaria services. Survey results 
will be translated into revised BCC tools and materials, updated refresher training for CHWs and 
health facility teams, improved mass media packages, more targeted community outreach, and 
supervision and monitoring of BCC efforts. A more in-depth qualitative barrier analysis will 
complement the quantitative KAP survey to better understand the determinants of positive 
behaviors (i.e., “positive deviants”). Based on the results of these formative data collection 
activities, BCC activities may be targeted to children as message agents with integration of 
malaria communication tools into schools. Efforts to increase CHW and health facility staff 
effectiveness through interpersonal communication tools may also be intensified. 
 
As the current three-year malaria bilateral project comes to a close, PMI will transition to 
supporting an integrated communication package promoting health behaviors, particularly in 
health facilities. Malaria is a key component of the integrated health package and this support 
will build on the synergy that exists between malaria and maternal and child health programs.  
 
Proposed activities with FY 2015 funding: ($600,000) 
 
1. BCC for ITNs, IPTp, and case management: BCC will be part of a communication 
package including ITN use, IPTp uptake, and case management at the health facility and 
community levels. Activities will be focused in the PMI target zones but will be 
consistent with the NMCP’s national communication plan and national policies, and 
coordinated with BCC activities in the rest of the country ($500,000) and, 
2. BCC for integrated health service delivery: BCC will also be supported through an 
integrated platform with funds to a new Mission bilateral program addressing service 
delivery throughout Guinea. PMI funds will supplement maternal child health, family 
planning, and reproductive health funds (which represent the bulk of this activity) to 
provide a comprehensive package of key health behaviors through health facilities. 
($100,000). 
 
 
HEALTH SYSTEM STRENGTHENING AND CAPACITY BUILDING 
 
PMI/NMCP objectives 
 
The national strategic plan aims at controlling malaria to promote a sustainable social and 
economic development of the country. Hence, the MOH has assigned the NMCP the mission of 
providing the Guinea population with universal access to quality malaria care, in accordance 
with the national health policy. The national health policy also recommends that universal access 
to malaria care for the people of Guinea should be supported by values such as social justice, 
solidarity, equity, ethics, probity, and quality. 
 
Moreover, the new malaria strategic plan endorses good governance principles, gender equality, 
consideration for evidence-based practices, and recommendations provided by international 
institutions in charge of malaria control, mainly the WHO. Those principles are reflected in 
 50 
 
various documents adopted by regional organizations including the African Union and the 
Economic Community of West African States and adhered to by the GOG, and include: 
� Promote the national malaria control policy based on the RBM partnership principles; 
� Reinforce the epidemiological surveillance system for malaria control through data 
collection and analysis for decision making; 
� Strengthen behavior change communication among the population in order to promote 
extensive use of malaria prevention measures and treatment products; 
� Elaborate, monitor, and evaluate implementation of the national malaria strategic plan on 
an annual basis; 
� Mobilize and manage human, financial and material resources necessary for the 
implementation of the national malaria strategic plan; and   
� Promote and develop partnerships with all stakeholders in the control of malaria. 
 
The achievement of the goal set forth by the malaria strategic plan calls for the following specific 
objectives: 
� Ensure protection of at least 80% of the population with effective malaria prevention 
measures; 
� Ensure biological confirmation of 90% of malaria cases; 
� Provide an early and correct treatment of 90% of malaria cases; 
� Reinforce the monitoring and evaluation system at all levels, in accordance with the 
revised monitoring and evaluation plan; and 
� Strengthen the management (planning and coordination) capabilities of the NMCP.  
 
Progress since the launch of PMI 
 
The Guinea health system continues to face important staffing challenges, mainly a shortage of 
qualified health workers at all levels of the health system. In an attempt to reduce human 
resources for health gap, the GOG recruited 2,000 health workers graduating from various 
national system health training schools in the first quarter of 2014. The newly recruited staff will 
soon be distributed to different levels of the health system. Similarly, with persistent advocacy 
from donors including USAID, the new Minister of Health considers that increasing the 
proportion of the health budget in the national budget remains a priority of the GOG in the 
foreseeable future, which may positively reflect on the resources allocated to the malaria 
program.   
 
The NMCP’s performance has improved due to GOG, PMI, and other partners’ efforts to 
reinforce their capacity during the past two years, but the NMCP still needs more strengthening 
to be able to better coordinate malaria control efforts. The NMCP receives financial support from 
the Global Fund to cover many operating expenses, including salary for part of the staff, office 
supplies, transportation means, and gas for routine operations.  
 
Efforts to assist the NMCP to build a reliable malaria database linked to the national health 
management information system are underway with support from various partners including the 
Global Fund and PMI. With support from the PMI-funded malaria bilateral project, the revised 
monitoring and evaluation plan, an integral part of the new malaria strategic plan, will be 
 51 
 
implemented to improve malaria program performance metrics and enable timely decision 
making.     
 
Progress during the last 12 Months 
 
To support the NMCP to better perform its assigned mission by the GOG, PMI has sponsored in 
FY 2013 an assessment of the organizational and operational capabilities of the program. 
Conducted by a local firm, the assessment identified a few strengths including a clear line of 
communication with the MOH, the existence of basic documents such as a strategic plan and 
standard operations manual, as well as the engagement and the availability of the staff to 
participate in action plans implementation. However, the weaknesses identified by the reviewers 
largely outweigh the above listed strengths. Among the most important is the lack of an 
appropriate and well-functioning office building to host the program. The results of the 
assessment also revealed that there is a lack of capacity in financial management and an 
insufficient sharing of financial information with the staff members on how the program 
resources are managed. 
 
PMI, through the malaria bilateral program, has discussed the outcomes of the assessment with 
the NMCP leadership and staff, and is taking a participatory approach to develop an action plan 
to implement the recommendations resulting from the assessment. During the MOP planning 
visit, the MOP team insistently pointed out the relevance of making reorganizing and 
strengthening the NMCP a high priority. The current momentum seems favorable to achieve the 
needed change with the appointment of a new Minister of Health, unanimously perceived to be 
open to bring about changes. 
 
PMI also supported the recruitment of a senior malaria technical advisor to the NMCP through 
the Leadership Management Grant, using funding from the 5% Global Fund resource. The third 
country national is said to have contributed to strengthening the management of the program, 
including supporting the process for planning and developing the concept note for the Global 
Fund New Funding Model scheduled for submission in June 2014.   
 
During the past twelve months, PMI also supported malaria donors’ coordination through the 
malaria bilateral project and using the RBM partnership framework. Meetings were held on a 
quarterly basis and support for dissemination of meetings outcomes to malaria stakeholders was 
provided.  
 
Plan and justification 
 
Given the challenges that malaria prevention and control in Guinea are facing, PMI resources 
will be used to address priorities that are directly linked to malaria service delivery and 
management of the program. Once the newly recruited health workers are deployed in the health 
facilities and prefecture hospitals, PMI will support the NMCP to train them on malaria 
prevention and case management. PMI will put special emphasis on supporting the 
implementation of the recommendations of the NMCP assessment. Actions will include 
advocacy and involvement of MOH high level officials to implement politically-sensitive actions 
that will improve the leadership and the performance of the program. 
 52 
 
 
With FY 2015 funding, PMI will continue supporting the NMCP to conduct supervision and 
provide logistics support including office management, communication capacity through internet 
connectivity, and M&E system strengthening. Given that the NMCP assessment was conducted 
in late 2013, no new funding is necessary to implement the recommendations related to capacity 
building. PMI will use prior year funding to that effect.  
 
PMI will also continue its partnership with Peace Corps Guinea to work on malaria at the 
community level. Peace Corps Response Volunteers are usually third-year volunteers or 
volunteers who have previously completed their service and have applied for a Response 
Volunteer position, generally with an NGO or to coordinate and lead other volunteers’ activities 
related to a specific health project. Peace Corps’ Stomp Out Malaria program is active in Guinea 
and PMI has benefited from volunteers’ activities at the community level with coordination and 
assistance from the Response Volunteer. 
 
Proposed activities with FY 2015 funding: ($120,000) 
 
1. Support to the NMCP to assist them in team building, logistics and supervision, office 
management including communication capacity/connectivity, and M&E systems 
strengthening ($100,000); and 
2. Support to Peace Corps: Maintain a Response Volunteer in Conakry and support to 
supervise volunteers who are supporting PMI activities as well as small grants for which 
Peace Corps Volunteers can apply to receive assistance to support malaria activities in 
their communities ($20,000). 
 
STAFFING AND ADMINISTRATION 
 
Two health professionals serve as resident advisors (RAs) to oversee PMI in Guinea, one 
representing CDC and one representing USAID. In addition, one or more foreign service 
nationals (FSNs) work as part of the PMI team. All PMI staff members are part of a single inter-
agency team led by the USAID Mission Director or his/her designee in country. The PMI team 
shares responsibility for development and implementation of PMI strategies and work plans, 
coordination with national authorities, managing collaborating agencies and supervising day-to-
day activities. Candidates for resident advisor positions (whether initial hires or replacements) 
will be evaluated and/or interviewed jointly by USAID and CDC, and both agencies will be 
involved in hiring decisions, with the final decision made by the individual agency.   
 
PMI professional staff work together to oversee all technical and administrative aspects of the 
PMI, including finalizing details of the project design, implementing malaria prevention and 
treatment activities, monitoring and evaluation of outcomes and impact, reporting of results, and 
providing guidance to PMI partners. 
 
The PMI lead in country is the USAID Mission Director. The two PMI resident advisors (RA), 
one from USAID and one from CDC, report to the Senior USAID Health Officer for day-to-day 
leadership, and work together as a part of a single interagency team. The technical expertise 
housed in Atlanta and Washington guides PMI programmatic efforts and thus overall technical 
 53 
 
guidance for both RAs falls to the PMI staff in Atlanta and Washington. Since CDC RAs are 
CDC employees (CDC USDD—38), responsibility for completing official performance reviews 
lies with the CDC PMI Regional Coordinator who is expected to rely upon input from PMI staff 
across the two agencies that work closely day in and day out with the CDC RA and thus best 
positioned to comment on the RA’s performance. 
 
The two PMI RAs are based within the USAID health office and are expected to spend 
approximately half their time sitting with and providing technical assistance to the national 
malaria control programs and partners.  
 
Locally-hired staff to support PMI activities either in ministries or in USAID will be approved 
by the USAID Mission Director. Because of the need to adhere to specific country policies and 
USAID accounting regulations, any transfer of PMI funds directly to ministries or host 
governments will need to be approved by the USAID Mission Director and Controller, in 
addition to the United States government Global Malaria Coordinator. 
 
Proposed activities with FY 2015 funding: ($1,100,000) 
 
1. USAID technical staff: Support one Resident Advisor and one foreign service national to 
support malaria activities and administration costs($700,000); and 
2. CDC technical staff: Support one Resident Advisor to support malaria activities and 
administration costs ($400,000).
