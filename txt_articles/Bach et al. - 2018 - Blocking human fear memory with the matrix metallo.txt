Blocking human fear memory with the matrix
metalloproteinase inhibitor doxycycline
DR Bach1,2,3, A Tzovara1,2,3 and J Vunder1,2
Learning to predict threat is a fundamental ability of many biological organisms, and a laboratory model for anxiety disorders.
Interfering with such memories in humans would be of high clinical relevance. On the basis of studies in cell cultures and slice
preparations, it is hypothesised that synaptic remodelling required for threat learning involves the extracellular enzyme matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP) 9. However, in vivo evidence for this proposal is lacking. Here we investigate human Pavlovian fear conditioning
under the blood–brain barrier crossing MMP inhibitor doxycyline in a pre-registered, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial. We find that recall of threat memory, measured with fear-potentiated startle 7 days after acquisition, is attenuated by ~ 60% in
individuals who were under doxycycline during acquisition. This threat memory impairment is also reflected in increased
behavioural surprise signals to the conditioned stimulus during subsequent re-learning, and already late during initial acquisition.
Our findings support an emerging view that extracellular signalling pathways are crucially required for threat memory formation.
Furthermore, they suggest novel pharmacological methods for primary prevention and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder.

INTRODUCTION
Learning to predict threat is a fundamental ability of many
biological organisms, yet in anxiety disorders dysfunctional over-
prediction of threat causes tremendous suffering. A dedicated
threat memory system in many mammals including humans can be
probed using Pavlovian discriminative fear conditioning.1 In this
paradigm, an initially neutral cue (conditioned stimulus, CS+) is
contingently paired with an aversive event (unconditioned stimulus,
US), while a different cue (CS − ) is not. Crucial pivot in learning US
predictions is a synaptic reconfiguration that leads to long-term
potentiation (LTP) of amygdala neurons with converging CS and US
input.1 Interfering with threat memory in Pavlovian fear condition-
ing is being investigated as preclinical model for treatment of
posttraumatic stress disorder.2 However, pharmacological manip-
ulation of threat memories in humans has been difficult. The most
direct mechanism of action used in non-human research—broad
spectrum
protein
synthesis
inhibition3—is
not
applicable
in
humans.4 A more specific option is propranolol, which interferes
with human threat learning possibly by inhibiting synthesis of
proteins required for synaptic plasticity.2,5 However, propranolol
may be less effective in individuals with high trait anxiety.6 In this
paper, we sought to inhibit synaptic remodelling by targeting an
extracellular signalling pathway.
In the past decades, evidence has accumulated for a role of
extracellular matrix in memory formation.7,8 In terms of its
structure, extracellular matrix is organised in perineuronal nets.9
Their integrity is crucial for memory storage, including threat
memory.10–12 Functionally, the signalling pathway that induces
LTP appears to involve extracellular enzymes, and specifically
matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9).7 In slices, MMP-9 inhibition or
knockout reduces long-term potentiation.13–16 Interestingly, active
MMP-9 alone is sufficient to induce LTP.13,14 In vivo, MMP-9
inhibition appears to impact on spatial/contextual memory in non-
human mammals.17,18 While the precise mechanism by which
MMP-9 takes part in synaptic circuit remodelling remains elusive,7
these findings suggest that MMP-9 may be required for formation
of human fear memories. Here, we sought to impair human
Pavlovian
fear
conditioning
with
the
tetracycline
antibiotic
doxycycline, a blood–brain barrier crossing19 in vivo and in vitro
MMP-9 inhibitor.20,21 To isolate effects of the drug on fear
acquisition/consolidation from direct effects on retrieval, we
trained participants under doxycycline or placebo, and tested
fear retention 7 days later.
Unlike in rodent species, fear conditioning in humans does not
elicit overt behavioural responses to the CS. It is usually quantified
using readouts from the automomic nervous system such as skin
conductance responses (SCR),22–24 or by its interaction with an
innate startle response, termed fear-potentiated startle.25–27 The
latter method is the most sensitive way to measure fear retention
after initial learning,28 but during initial learning the presentation
of startle stimuli inhibits fear acquisition.29 Hence our primary
outcome measure was fear-potentiated startle eye blink response
(SEBR) during fear retention. To quantify the progress of fear
learning and re-learning where no startle stimuli were delivered,
we relied on SCR. While fear-potentiated startle scales with CS/US
association strength,30 SCR are suggested to reflect CS-specific
associability,31,32 which is based on a weighted average of surprise
about the previous outcomes following this CS.33
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Participants were recruited from the general population (n = 80; 40 per
group; 20 female per group). Two participants did not complete acquisition

 another due to an irresolvable computer failure. Two further participants
were excluded from analysis: one due to failure of the startle sound
equipment on visit 3, and the other did not comply with instructions and
pressed response keys on o2% of trials on both visits. Re-including these
participants into the analysis did not change any of the statistical inference
results. The reported final sample therefore comprised 76 individuals, 38
per group (Figure 1a). The groups did not differ in age, gender, body mass
index or baseline personality measures (Table 1). All participants were
screened for health conditions by a physician (see Supplementary
Information for in- and exclusion criteria). The study was conducted in
accord with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the governmental
research ethics committee (Kantonale Ethikkomission Zurich, KEK-ZH 2014-
0669) and the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products (Swissmedic, Bern,
Switzerland; 2015DR1136). All participants gave written informed consent
using a form approved by the ethics committee. The study was pre-
registered at the primary ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN66987216) and at the
Swiss Federal Complementary Database (KOFAM; SNCTP000001439).
Power analysis
To determine required sample size, we conducted a power analysis (using
G*power34) based on a pilot study with the same setup,28 in which the
effect size for a CS+/CS − SEBR difference in an untreated control group
was (Cohen's) d = 1.17. Under the assumption of equal variance in a
doxycycline-treated group, a fear memory reduction of 50% would
correspond to an effect size of d = 0.59. Thus, a sample size of N = 74
was required to achieve 80% power at an alpha rate of 0.05. We recruited
N = 80 participants to allow for attrition.
Study medication
The study medication was doxycycline, brand name Vibramycin (Pfizer,
Zurich, Switzerland). The study dose of 200 mg was based on the smallest
antibiotic dose recommended by the manufacturer, in order to reduce side
effects. Peak cerebrospinal fluid concentrations are reached at approxi-
mately 180 min after oral administration.19 The drug's half-life is ~ 16 h
according to manufacturer's information; such the drug was cleared by
more than 99.9% at the retention test 7 days after ingestion. A GMP-
licensed pharmacy (Kantonsapotheke, Zurich, Switzerland) manufactured,
blinded and randomised the study medication separately for males and
females; mannitol was used as placebo. Randomisation code was broken
after the last participant completed the study, and after all data were
checked for consistency.
Procedure
Screening visit 1 (day − 7 to day − 1).
Study procedure is summarised in
Figure 1b. On visit 1, we determined US intensity and habituated
participants to startle sounds, performed medical examination to check
exclusion criteria (Supplementary Information), and measured weight/
height to compute body mass index.
Acquisition visit 2 (day 0).
Acquisition visit 2 took part in the morning
hours between 0800 and 1300 hours. Participants filled in the German
translations of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory35 and Beck's Depression
Inventory36 before ingesting the study medication. During a 180-min
metabolisation interval, they were kept under surveillance of study staff.
Next, participants performed a 15-minute N-back working memory task

 and a paper-and-pencil version of the d2 attention test. Then the fear
acquisition protocol started. This was a standard discriminant delay
conditioning paradigm with 160 trials (80 CS+, 80 CS − ) in two blocks
(Figure 1c). The CS+ co-terminated with an electric stimulation as aversive
US (Supplementary Information) in 50% of trials. CS were a blue or red
screen background presented for 4 s, while the screen was black during
the inter trial interval, randomly determined to be 7, 9 or 11 s. Trial
sequence was randomly balanced for each participant, with the restriction
that the first trial of each block was always a reinforced CS+. As an
incidental task, participants were instructed to press a key with right index
or middle finger to indicate CS colour. Colour-CS and colour-button
associations were balanced across participants. Colour-CS association had
no impact on any outcome measure.
Retention visit 3 (day 7).
Participants were instructed that they might
receive US, but that CS/US contingency was determined by the computer
and unknown to the study assistant. They saw 40 CS (20 CS+/20 CS − ) in
randomly balanced order, and heard a startle probe (Supplementary
Information) 3.5 s after onset of all CS, but never received a US. Note that
the motoric startle response makes SCR data from this session unusable.
Immediately afterwards, we measured re-learning over 80 trials by co-
terminating 50% of CS with a US over 80 trials, but without startle sounds.
N-back task.
Random letters were shown on the screen for 500 ms
followed by a fixation cross for 2500 ms. Participants were tasked to
indicate on each trial whether the letter matched the one from N steps
back. N was constant (1/2/3) within each of three blocks.37 Each block
contained 70 non-targets and 30 targets.
d2 test.
The d2-test38 is designed to measure sustained attention over
5 min. Participants are given 20 seconds to work on each of 14 rows; in
each row their task is to cross every letter 'd' marked with two lines above
and/or below, while leaving out the letter 'd' not marked with two lines, as
well as the letter 'p'.
Outcome measures.
Primary outcome measure was startle potentiation
during the retention test, measured as SEBR from orbicularis oculi
electromyogram (Supplementary Information). There were no missing
data in the primary outcome. Secondary outcome measure was SCR. No
SCR data were available for three participants during acquisition (one
placebo, two doxycycline) and for one participant during re-learning
(placebo), due to electrode detachment. Because of artefacts, a small
number of individual trials in some participants were excluded (o1.5% of
trials, see Supplementary Information for details).
Psychophysiological modelling
For psychophysiological analysis, we used a Matlab toolbox for psycho-
physiological modelling, PsPM 3.0 (pspm.sourceforge.net). SEBR processing
was performed using the most sensitive method from a previous
methodological comparison using the same setup28 (Supplementary
Information). This procedure builds on a psychophysiological model
(PsPM)39 and quantifies, for each trial, amplitude of the SEBR by linear
regression onto a canonical SEBR with variable onset.28 Skin conductance
was analysed by nonlinear inversion of a PsPM that describes the
anticipatory SCR23,24 under a canonical response function.40,41
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was done in R (www.r-project.org), version 3.3.1, using
aov() for analysis of variance (ANOVA). R package nlme, version 3.1.128,
was
used
for
linear
mixed
effects
(LME)
models
(Supplementary
Information).42 We analysed trial-wise SEBR in a 2 (drug) ×
2 (CS
+/CS − ) × 20 (trial) multistratum repeated-measures ANOVA. Because trial
sequence was not the same for each participant, habituation may affect CS
+ and CS − differently in the two groups. Therefore, results were confirmed
in a LME model that accounts for the linear effect of time (trial number
across CS). For SCR, only trials without US entered analysis. As there are
uneven numbers of CS+US- and CS −
trials, we averaged within
mini-blocks of 10 trials, and entered these averages into a 2 (drug) × 2
(CS+/CS − ) × 16 (mini-block) repeated-measures ANOVA (acquisition) or 2
(drug) × 2 (CS+/CS − ) × 8 ANOVA (re-learning). Participants for whom all
trials
in
at
least
one
mini-block
were
missing
were
excluded
(Supplementary Information). Results were confirmed in a trial-wise LME,
in which missing data points were removed on a trial-by-trial basis, as this
model can deal with unbalanced data.
N-back task.
Performance was averaged within conditions and analysed
in a 3 (N-back) x 2 (target/non-target) repeated-measures ANOVA.
Control measures.
Control measures were tested for group differences
with
independent
samples
t-tests,
without
correction
for
multiple
comparison. We tested the following measures: age, weight, body mass
index, Beck’s Depression Inventory sum score, STAI sum scores, electric
current used as US, difference in averaged ratings of the same 14 pain
stimuli before and after the acquisition test. Further, we tested the
following three outcomes of the d2-test: performance of attention (marked
—missed targets), speed (total number of targets processed), error
percentage (all errors divided by total processed targets). During fear
acquisition, we analysed performance (any key pressed), accuracy (correct
key pressed) and reaction times. No t-test for group differences on any
control measure yielded a statistically significant result. Entering anxiety
and depression scores, or pain habituation during the acquisition session,
into the statistical model as a covariate, together with the covariate × CS
interaction, had no impact on statistical significance of the primary
outcome (interaction drug × CS during retention).
RESULTS
Three-and-a-half hours after orally ingesting placebo or 200 mg
doxycyline, participants performed a discriminant delay fear
conditioning task (Figure 1c) in which the CS+ co-terminated
with an aversive electrical stimulation in 50% of trials, while the
CS − was never reinforced. To reduce a potential impact of
variability in learning speed, we overtrained participants in 160
trials (80 CS+, 80 CS − ). Before the fear acquisition task started, we
ensured that doxycycline had no impact on pain perception,
attention in the d2 test, or memory on a seconds timescale in a
1/2/3-back task (see Materials and Methods, Table 1, Figure 2 and
Supplementary Information). Performance in an incidental task
during fear acquisition was also unchanged by the drug.

Blocking human fear memory with doxycycline

 Primary outcome was fear retention under extinction, 7 days
after acquisition (see Figure 3a and Supplementary Information).
Fear-potentiated startle was measured as SEBR to acoustic startle
probes on each of 40 extinction trials, and analysed in a repeated-
measures ANOVA. Threat memory (that is, CS+/CS − difference in
SEBR) was attenuated by ~ 60% in the doxycycline as compared
to placebo group (interaction drug × CS: P = 0.01). This initial
analysis did not take into account that the sequence of CS+ and
CS − was randomised for each participant, and might have been
slightly different between the two groups. This is why we
replicated these results in a LME model with trial number as
predictor across CS types (see Supplementary Information for
details). This analysis revealed the same group difference in threat
memory (interaction drug × CS: P = 0.021). Finally, there was no
difference between the groups in terms of extinction (that is, no
drug × trial × CS interaction).
Next, we analysed the re-learning session, which immediately
followed the retention session and always started with a
reinforced CS+ trial. No startle probes were used during this
session in order to allow unimpaired learning.29 Instead we
analysed SCR, which are thought to reflect a Pearce-Hall type
associability signal,33 that is, a running average of surprise about
the outcome on previous trials.31,32 If fear memory were weak
during the non-reinforced retention test, one would expect
greater surprise about the presence of a US during the reinforced
re-learning session. This would imply a larger CS+/CS − difference
in SCR, particular in the beginning of the re-learning session.
Indeed during re-learning, SCR surprise signals were larger in the
doxycycline than in the placebo group in a block-wise ANOVA
that was ignorant about trial sequence, and in a LME model that
took account of trial sequence (interaction drug × CS; ANOVA:
P = 0.010;
LME:
Po0.001;
Figure
3b
and
Supplementary
Information). The more sensitive LME model furthermore indi-
cated that enlarged surprise signals upon CS+ presentation in the
doxycyline group decreased over time (interaction drug × CS ×
time; P = 0.028), as expected (see Figure 3b and Supplementary
Information). These findings are consistent with weaker threat
memory at the start of the re-learning session.
Finally, we sought to elucidate whether doxycycline acts on
memory consolidation after acquisition alone, or whether an effect
of the drug was already observable during acquisition. This was an
exploratory analysis. As in the re-learning session, we found a
larger CS+/CS − difference in SCR in the doxycycline than placebo
group, potentially indicating greater surprise about the presence
of the US in this group (interaction drug × CS; ANOVA: Po0.001;

repetitions, i.e., a positive bias implies that participants were more
likely to indicate 'same letter' than 'different letter'. There was
no statistically significant impact of doxycycline on d' or bias
(Supplementary Information).

 LME: Po0.001; see Figure 3c and Supplementary Information).
This pattern could be explained if the neural system, for each of
the CS, keeps track of recent surprise about CS outcome, but fails
to appropriately update outcome predictions. Such model is in
keeping with our initial result that performance in a 1/2/3-back
task, addressing memory on a timescale of seconds, was intact in
the doxycycline group. According to this interpretation, the group
difference in surprise signals should be small in the beginning of
the session (when both groups have not yet formed CS/US
associations) and increase towards the end (when the placebo
group has formed stronger associations). This was indeed the
case: The LME results indicated that enlarged surprise signals
upon CS+ presentation in the doxycyline group were not found in
earlier but in later trials of the learning session (interaction
Drug × CS × Time; P = 0.021), and this appeared to start after about
40 trials (see Figure 3c and Supplementary Information).
DISCUSSION
In this paper, we addressed inhibition of human fear conditioning
with the MMP inhibitor doxcycyline. In the primary outcome, fear-
potentiated startle, we found reduced fear memory retention in
those participants who were trained under doxycycline. This
attenuated fear memory was also evident by increased surprise
to the CS+ during re-learning directly after the retention test, as
compared to a placebo group. Because doxycycline was ingested
before the acquisition session, this raises a question as to whether
doxycycline impacts already on threat memory acquisition, or only
later on consolidation. Analysis of the acquisition session provides
some evidence for the former view, that is, that doxycycline impacts
on threat memory already during training session. However, it does
not impair sensory memory on a timescale of seconds, as shown by
unimpaired performance in an N-back task.
Doxcycline is a potent inhibitor of human MMP-9 and other
MMPs.20,21 Our results are in keeping with a model in which
human amygdala-dependent threat memory requires extracellular
MMP signalling for synaptic remodelling. Because in our human
model we cannot conclusively rule out that other molecular
targets of doxycycline contribute to memory impairment, conver-
ging evidence with other human MMP inhibitors would be
desirable.
Doxycycline
has
been
reported
to
interact
with
mitochondrial function,43 and less consistently, with mammalian
protein
synthesis.44
However,
a
possible
relation
of
these
molecular targets to synaptic plasticity or to memory formation
is not established. They therefore appear as less likely to underlie
the results reported here. Whether doxycycline also impacts on
human hippocampus-dependent, spatial or semantic memory, as
previously hypothesised,17,18 remains to be determined. Early
human work performed in the context of sleep research has
provided some hints that doxycycline may have an impact on
semantic
memory45
but
also
pointed
towards
a
potential
interaction with rapid eye movement sleep.46
Our
primary
outcome,
fear-potentiated
startle,
is
a
well-
established
measure
of
fear
memory
strength
in
many
species,25,47–51 such that the impact of doxycycline on fear
retention in this measure can be unambiguously interpreted. In
contrast, our analysis of its effect on fear acquisition relies on SCR.
Under native conditions, averaged SCR across an entire experiment
are often taken as in index of association strength,22 but their
fluctuations over time appear to be more consistent with an
associability signal.31,32 The former view is justified because on
average, associability is higher for a partially reinforced CS+ than a
CS− , but under a pharmacological manipulation, associability and
association strength may be decoupled. In the current experiment,
it appears that sensory memory is intact under doxycyline, as
indexed by results from the 1/2/3-back task. We suggest that the
fear learning system stores a running average of surprise about
previous trial outcomes, but that it fails to appropriately update
threat predictions. This would lead to a continued occurrence of
unpredicted US, which would be reflected in higher associability of
CS+ in the doxcycline group. In the placebo group, after establish-
ing the threat prediction, SCR to the CS+ would tend to habituate
faster as the US becomes predicted and associability decreases.
Indeed, we show that SCR to CS+ are greater in the doxycycline
than placebo group after about 40 trials into the experiment. Our
interpretation relies on an impact of doxycline on updating threat
predictions, but not storage of previous trial outcomes. This is in
keeping with an impact of MMP-9 inhibitors on late LTP, but not on
other synaptic plasticity mechanisms such as early LTP and paired-
pulse facilitation,7 but requires confirmation on a molecular level.
While evidence for a role of MMP-9 in LTP is mounting, its
mechanism of action is unknown. In slices and cell cultures, MMP-9
appears to be transported to synapses at times of neural activity,52
colocalises with NMDA- and AMPA-receptors,53 and impacts on
spine re-modelling.14 However, its proteolytic target remains
elusive. It has been hypothesised that MMP-9 activates a signalling
pathway that ultimately leads integrins to direct AMPA receptors
into the synaptic membrane.7 Others have proposed that MMP-9 is
involved in remodelling extracellular matrix structure which
according to this model enjoys a fundamental role in memory
storage8 and enables long-term stability of threat memories, which
—after hour-timescale consolidation—last up to a lifetime.54
Such uncertainty notwithstanding, our findings have potentially
direct therapeutic implications. They suggest that tetracycline
antibiotics—all of which are MMP inhibitors20—could be used for
primary prevention of fear memory acquisition in persons known in
advance to be potentially exposed to trauma. Furthermore, it is
known that retrieval of fear memory, for example, by presentation
of a CS+ without US—renders this memory labile.3 Subsequent
re-consolidation is a protein synthesis-dependent process,3 and it
has been suggested that pharmacological disruption of this process
may specifically erase human fear memory.5 This would render the
combination of specific fear re-activation and pharmacological
intervention a potential treatment principle for posttraumatic stress
disorder. It is not known whether re-consolidation involves the
same signalling cascades as required for initial consolidation; yet
there is a suggestion that broad-band MMP inhibition may interfere
with fear memory re-consolidation in rodents.55 Hence, impairing
human fear re-consolidation with MMP-9 inhibitors is a potential
target for further research. This could complement recent efforts2 at
finding novel strategies for the treatment of posttraumatic stress
disorder, and other anxiety disorders.
