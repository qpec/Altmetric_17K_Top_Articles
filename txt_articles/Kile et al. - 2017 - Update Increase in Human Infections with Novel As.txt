Among all influenza viruses assessed using CDC’s Influenza 
Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT), the Asian lineage avian influenza 
A(H7N9) virus (Asian H7N9), first reported in China in March 
2013,* is ranked as the influenza virus with the highest potential 
pandemic risk (1). During October 1, 2016–August 7, 2017, the 
National Health and Family Planning Commission of China; 
CDC, Taiwan; the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection; 
and the Macao CDC reported 759 human infections with 
Asian H7N9 viruses, including 281 deaths, to the World Health 
Organization (WHO), making this the largest of the five epi-
demics of Asian H7N9 infections that have occurred since 2013 
(Figure 1). This report summarizes new viral and epidemiologic 
features identified during the fifth epidemic of Asian H7N9 in 
China and summarizes ongoing measures to enhance pandemic 
preparedness. Infections in humans and poultry were reported 
from most areas of China, including provinces bordering other 
countries, indicating extensive, ongoing geographic spread. The 
risk to the general public is very low and most human infections 
were, and continue to be, associated with poultry exposure, espe-
cially at live bird markets in mainland China. Throughout the first 
four epidemics of Asian H7N9 infections, only low pathogenic 
avian influenza (LPAI) viruses were detected among human, 
poultry, and environmental specimens and samples. During the 
fifth epidemic, mutations were detected among some Asian H7N9 
viruses, identifying the emergence of high pathogenic avian influ-
enza (HPAI) viruses as well as viruses with reduced susceptibility 
to influenza antiviral medications recommended for treatment. 
Furthermore, the fifth-epidemic viruses diverged genetically into 
two separate lineages (Pearl River Delta lineage and Yangtze River 
Delta lineage), with Yangtze River Delta lineage viruses emerging 
as antigenically different compared with those from earlier epidem-
ics. Because of its pandemic potential, candidate vaccine viruses 
(CVV) were produced in 2013 that have been used to make vac-
cines against Asian H7N9 viruses circulating at that time. CDC
is working with partners to enhance surveillance for Asian H7N9 
viruses in humans and poultry, to improve laboratory capability
to detect and characterize H7N9 viruses, and to develop, test and

distribute new CVV that could be used for vaccine production 
if a vaccine is needed.
Epidemiologic data were collected from the WHO Disease 
Outbreak News† and Influenza Risk Assessment summaries,§ and 
from recent publications. Genetic and virus characterization data 
were collected from the publically accessible Global Initiative on 
Sharing All Influenza Data and GenBank databases.¶ Nucleotide 
sequence alignments of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase 
(NA) genes were created and used to generate phylogenetic trees 
for lineage determination. Amino acid changes in fifth-epidemic 
viruses were identified through comparisons with CVVs produced 
using 2013 Asian H7N9 virus sequences, and identification of 
viruses as either LPAI or HPAI was accomplished by analysis of the 
HA cleavage site. CDC assessed the antigenic properties of virus 
isolates using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay employ-
ing a panel of reference ferret antisera that includes antisera raised 
to LPAI Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta fifth-epidemic 
viruses, HPAI H7N9 viruses, and the 2013 CVVs. The extent 
of cross-reactivity with 2013 CVVs and viruses from previous 
epidemics was assessed.
Epidemiology
During March 31, 2013–August 7, 2017, a total of 1,557 
human infections with Asian H7N9 viruses were reported; at 
least 605 (39%) of these infections resulted in death. All infec-
tions were either detected in mainland China, Hong Kong, 
and Macao, or associated with travel from mainland China 
(29 cases were exported to Malaysia, Canada, Hong Kong, 
Macao, and Taiwan). Infections were reported from more 
provinces, regions, and municipalities in China during the fifth 
epidemic (30) than during the first four epidemics combined 
(21) (Figure 2). Similar to epidemics 1–4, 70% of infections
during the fifth epidemic occurred in men, and the median
age was 57 years (range = 4–93 years); most occurred among
persons with recent poultry exposure (90%) and resulted in

infections during the fifth epidemic, 14 clusters of two or three 
persons with Asian H7N9 virus infections were reported to 
WHO, compared with an average of nine clusters in each of 
the previous epidemics (range = 4–11 clusters).
During the fifth epidemic, LPAI Asian H7N9 viruses acquired 
an HPAI mutation that causes increased morbidity and mortal-
ity in poultry. Ten of 33 provinces, regions, and municipalities 
in China reported HPAI Asian H7N9 viruses in poultry and 
environmental samples: Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hebei, 
Heilongjiang, Henan, Hunan, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, and 
Tianjin.†† Among the 759 human infections identified in the fifth 
epidemic, 27  were HPAI Asian H7N9 viruses (11 from Guangxi, 
eight from Guangdong, five from Hunan, one from Hebei and 
one from Shaanxi Provinces, and one from Taiwan)§§ (3). Human 
infections with HPAI Asian H7N9 viruses were significantly more 
likely to occur in rural areas, among persons with early hospital

admission, and after exposure to sick or dead poultry, but were 
otherwise similar in their demographic and clinical characteristics 
to infections with LPAI Asian H7N9 viruses (3,4).
Analysis of Virus Gene Sequences
Analysis of HA gene sequences demonstrated two distinct 
Asian H7N9 virus lineages isolated from humans during the 
fifth epidemic: the Pearl River Delta lineage and Yangtze River 
Delta lineage (5). Among 166 fifth-epidemic Asian H7N9 virus 
HA gene sequences entered into Global Initiative on Sharing All 
Influenza Data and GenBank, 160 were from infected humans 
in mainland China, five were from Hong Kong, and one was 
from Taiwan. A total of 159 of the virus HA sequences were 
from the Yangtze River Delta lineage and seven were from the 
Pearl River Delta lineage, indicating the predominance of the 
Yangtze River Delta lineage. In addition, 35 (21%) of the 166 
fifth-epidemic Asian H7N9 virus specimens and samples (27, 
77% from human specimens and 8, 23% from environmental 
samples) with publicly available sequences had a four amino 
acid insertion in the cleavage site of the HA protein indicating 
a mutation found in HPAI viruses (6).

NA gene sequence data were available for all 166 viruses col-
lected during the fifth epidemic; 18 (10.8%) viruses (all from 
patients who were possibly treated with NA inhibitors) had 
genetic markers of reduced susceptibility to one or more NA 
inhibitors. All 166 viruses had the S31N mutation in the M2 
protein, indicating resistance to amantadine and rimantadine, 
as was observed in previous Asian H7N9 epidemics (7).
Analysis of Virus Surface Proteins
HI testing of fifth-epidemic Yangtze River Delta lineage 
viruses, which accounted for the majority of available viruses, 
demonstrated significant antigenic differences compared with 
2013 CVVs produced from 2013 Asian H7N9 viruses.¶¶ Ferret 
antisera raised against the 2013 CVVs poorly inhibited hemag-
glutination of fifth-epidemic Yangtze River Delta lineage viruses 
compared with inhibition of viruses tested from previous epi-
demics. HI testing of HPAI Asian H7N9 viruses also indicated 
significant antigenic differences compared with 2013 CVVs. 
As part of a National Institutes of Health trial, sera from adults 
who received vaccine produced using a 2013 Asian H7N9 CVV 
showed reduced cross-reactive HI and neutralizing antibody 
titers to fifth-epidemic Yangtze River Delta lineage and HPAI 
viruses, compared with titers to 2013 H7N9 viruses (8).
Discussion
The fifth annual epidemic of Asian H7N9 in China is 
marked by extensive geographic spread in poultry and in 
humans. The number of human infections reported in the fifth 
epidemic is almost as many as were reported during the previ-
ous four epidemics combined. The consistent epidemiology 
combined with a similar number of clusters suggests that the 
increased number of human infections appears to be associ-
ated with wider geographic spread and higher prevalence of 
Asian H7N9 viruses among poultry rather than any increased 
incidence of poultry-to-human or human-to-human spread. 
Furthermore, surveillance and testing have remained relatively 
unchanged from the fourth to fifth epidemic.
Although human infections with Asian H7N9 viruses from 
poultry are rare and no efficient or sustained human-to-human 
transmission has been detected, when human infections do 
occur, they are associated with severe illness and high mortal-
ity. Continued vigilance is important to identify changes in 
the virus that might have epidemiologic implications, such as 
increased transmission from poultry to humans or transmission 
between humans.
CDC assesses the pandemic potential of novel influenza A 
viruses using the IRAT evaluation tool. The IRAT analysis 
process considers the properties of the specific virus, attributes 
 
¶¶ http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/254827/1/WER9212.pdf?ua=1.
of the population, and associated ecology and epidemiology to 
assess the potential pandemic risk posed to human health by 
each virus. In light of the increased number of human infections 
and virologic changes observed during the fifth epidemic, CDC 
carried out an IRAT assessment of the newly emerged Yangtze 
River Delta lineage LPAI Asian H7N9 virus. This virus lineage 
scored as having the highest potential pandemic risk (moderate 
to high) among viruses similarly evaluated using the IRAT (1).
In March 2017, WHO recommended the development of 
new CVVs to match the antigenically distinguishable Yangtze 
River Delta viruses. The WHO Collaborating Center for 
the Surveillance, Epidemiology and Control of Influenza at 
CDC generated a new Asian H7N9 CVV derived from a 
Yangtze River Delta lineage LPAI Asian H7N9 virus, A/Hong 
Kong/125/2017 (an A/Hunan/02650/2016-like virus) (9). 
The WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research 
on Influenza in China developed a CVV from an HPAI Asian 
H7N9 virus, A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016. These CVVs, as 
well as others being developed by other WHO Collaborating 
Centers for Influenza, can be used for vaccine production, 
clinical trials, stockpiling and other pandemic preparedness 
purposes based on ongoing public health risk assessment.
The Government of China remains committed to controlling 
the transmission of Asian H7N9 viruses from birds to humans, 
and to mitigating human infections. Specific control measures 
implemented by the Government of China in response to the 
pandemic threat include strategies to minimize spread through 
promoting large-scale farming and centralized slaughtering, 
improving poultry product cold chain transportation and storage 
at markets, routine live poultry market closures with cleaning and 
disinfection, and a national poultry vaccination program (10). 
To monitor and control human infections, the Government of 
China has issued prevention and control protocols that include 
guidance on enhanced surveillance for influenza-like illness, 
severe acute respiratory infection, and pneumonia of unknown 
etiology; case investigation and contact tracing; and diagnosis 
and treatment guidance. Additional strategies to monitor and 
control human infections include conducting field investigations 
to identify and monitor close contacts of confirmed human 
infections, and testing environmental samples from possible 
exposure locations such as live bird markets (10).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions. First, underreporting of human infections and deaths 
with Asian H7N9 viruses is likely, given that most are identified 
through a passive surveillance system. Second, delays between 
what has been officially reported to, and publically released by, 
WHO might occur; thus numbers in this report might vary 
from those reported by other sources. Finally, as more genetic 
and antigenic data become available, further evaluation and char-
acterization of these viruses might reveal additional differences.

The evolving Asian H7N9 viruses highlight the importance 
of rapid analysis and public sharing of sequence data to inform 
pandemic preparedness efforts. These data allow for the rapid 
identification of genetic changes known to be associated with 
antigenic variation, antiviral drug susceptibility, mammalian 
adaptation, virulence and transmissibility. Assessments based 
on sequence data have the potential to inform surveillance, 
guide allocation of outbreak response resources, and inform 
pandemic preparedness policy decisions, such as selecting 
viruses for CVV development, and purchasing of prepandemic 
vaccines and antivirals. CDC continues to partner with China 
CDC, together with other China government organizations, 
United Nations organizations, and the governments of sur-
rounding countries to support surveillance for Asian H7N9 
viruses in humans, poultry, and environmental samples from 
live bird markets, and to enhance laboratory capacity. CDC’s 
International Influenza Program also supports efforts by >50 
countries to detect and respond to novel influenza A virus 
threats.*** Guidance for travelers to China is provided at the

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The current Asian lineage avian influenza A(H7N9) virus (Asian H7N9) 
epidemic in China is the fifth and largest epidemic on record.
What is added by this report?
Human infections with Asian H7N9 virus were reported from 
more provinces, regions, and municipalities in China during the 
fifth epidemic than in the previous four epidemics combined. 
Because of antigenic variation between the Yangtze River Delta 
lineage viruses, the newly emerged high pathogenic Asian 
H7N9 viruses, and 2013 candidate vaccine viruses, new 
candidate vaccine viruses have been produced.
What are the implications for public health practice?
These candidate vaccine viruses, as well as others being 
developed by other World Health Organization Collaborating 
Centers for Influenza, could be used for vaccine production, 
clinical trials, stockpiling, and other pandemic preparedness 
purposes, based on ongoing public health risk assessment. CDC 
has partnered with China CDC, and other China government 
organizations, United Nations organizations, and surrounding 
countries to enhance surveillance and laboratory capacity to 
detect and respond to Asian H7N9 in animals and humans.
