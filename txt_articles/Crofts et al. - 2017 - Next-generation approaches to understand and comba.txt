Abstract
Antibiotic resistance is a natural feature of diverse microbial ecosystems. Although recent studies 
of the antibiotic resistome have highlighted barriers to the horizontal transfer of antibiotic 
resistance genes between habitats, the rapid global spread of genes that confer resistance to 
carbapenem, colistin and quinolone antibiotics illustrates the dire clinical and societal 
consequences of such events. Over time, the study of antibiotic resistance has grown from 
focusing on single pathogenic organisms in axenic culture to studying antibiotic resistance in 
pathogenic, commensal and environmental bacteria at the level of microbial communities. As the 
study of antibiotic resistance advances, it is important to incorporate this comprehensive approach 
to better inform global antibiotic resistance surveillance and antibiotic development. It is 
increasingly becoming apparent that although not all resistance genes are likely to geographically 
and phylogenetically disseminate, the threat presented by those that are is serious and warrants an 
interdisciplinary research focus. In this Review, we highlight seminal work in the resistome field, 
discuss recent advances in the studies of resistomes, and propose a resistome paradigm that can 
pave the way for the improved proactive identification and mitigation of emerging antibiotic 
resistance threats.
Antibiotics have revolutionized modern medicine and have saved millions of lives since 
their discovery at the beginning of the twentieth century. These crucial drugs are invaluable 
owing to their ability to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria without damaging host cells and 
tissues1,2 (BOX 1). Aside from directly curing deadly infectious diseases, antibiotics have

 enabled physicians to pursue new treatments such as surgery, organ transplantation and 
cancer chemotherapy, which were previously infeasible or unsafe owing to the high 
collateral risk of infection3. Antibiotics remain one of the most commonly prescribed classes 
of drug, with more than 70 billion clinical doses administered globally in 2010, which 
represents a 36% increase in antibiotic consumption relative to 2000 (REF.4). Although the 
first antibiotics were synthetic compounds, most antibiotics are natural products or 
derivatives thereof5. Many antibiotics were recovered from cultured soil microorganisms, 
particularly those belonging to the Streptomyces genus3. As might be expected given their 
origins as natural products of bacterial secondary metabolism, many antibiotics can be 
detected at low levels in pristine environmental samples and have been found in samples that 
pre-date human antibiotic use6,7.
As a result of the ubiquity of antibiotic production by environmental microorganisms, 
defence mechanisms against these antibiotics and thus resistance (BOX 1) also seem to be 
ancient. Sequencing of ancient environmental DNA preserved in 30,000-year-old permafrost 
sediments has detected genes that confer resistance to several classes of antibiotic8, and the 
direct screening of bacteria cultured from a cave that had no anthropogenic contact for the 
past four million years revealed extensive resistance against 14 antibiotics9. Similarly, the 
host-associated microbiome of previously uncontacted indigenous people in South America 
was found to encode several antibiotic resistance genes10. This indicates that resistance to 
antibiotics far pre-dates the appropriation of these small molecules for human use.
The collection of resistance genes in a given environment, which is termed the ‘resistome’ 
(REFS11,12), encompasses both intrinsic and acquired resistance genes, as well as proto-
resistance genes and silent or cryptic resistance genes. It is thought that many 
clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes have their evolutionary origins in 
environmental microorganisms, which we define for the purposes of this article to comprise 
microorganisms that are not generally associated with humans. This hypothesis was 
pioneered by Benveniste and Davies13, who, in 1973, noted biochemically identical 
resistance-conferring kanamycin acetyltransferases in environmental Streptomyces spp. and 
in clinical isolates of pathogenic Escherichia coli. Further evidence was provided by a recent 
functional screen of soil metagenomes, which revealed the presence of environmental 
antibiotic resistance genes that have >99% nucleotide identity to resistance genes in 
pathogenic isolates14. Synteny of these genes with other resistance genes and mobility 
elements suggests that they are likely candidates for past or future dissemination by 
horizontal gene transfer (FIG. 1).
The ancient origins of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance make it unsurprising that large-
scale clinical and agricultural use of these compounds has selected for increasing resistance 
across the bacterial domain of life. Robust evidence for increasing environmental resistance 
exists in decades-old soil samples, in which increasing numbers of antibiotic resistance 
genes correlate with the industrial-scale production and use of these drugs15. The resulting 
deterioration of the efficacy of our antibacterial armamentarium has come with substantial 
costs that are expected to increase throughout the next decades. Worldwide, it has been 
estimated that at least 700,000 people die annually as a result of resistant infections, a figure 
that is predicted to increase to 10 million annual deaths by the year 2050 if the current

 trajectory is not altered. Throughout the next few decades, the cumulative global cost of 
antibiotic resistance is predicted to exceed US$100 trillion16.
The recent spread of mcr1, kpc, blaNDM1, qnr and other plasmid-borne resistance 
determinants (BOX 2) emphasizes two themes. The first is that in the antibiotic ‘arms race’ 
against bacteria, humanity is rarely ahead. This was exemplified by the first widely used 
antibiotics, the sulfonamides, against which resistance was observed only 6 years following 
their mass introduction17. More recently, resistance to tigecycline was identified even before 
its approval for human use, let alone its introduction into the clinic18. Therefore, it is either a 
sign of hubris or a lack of understanding of evolutionary principles when new antibiotics are 
advertised as being resistance-proof. The second theme has been our relatively myopic 
(albeit understandable) focus on resistance in human pathogens. It is a tautology that 
antibiotics are most effective at treating human pathogens. They would not be antibiotics if 
they failed to effectively treat pathogens, but our emphasis on a few pathogen ‘trees’ initially 
resulted in the field of antibiotics being blind to the ‘forest’ of environmental bacteria. The 
targets of most antibiotics are both highly conserved and essential across bacterial taxa, and 
have therefore made excellent mediators of intra-kingdom communication and competition 
among bacteria throughout biological history19. When our view is expanded to include the 
vast diversity of non-pathogenic bacteria, it is not surprising to see that all genera of the 
bacterial kingdom have evolved resistance mechanisms that protect these vital processes.
In this Review, we examine these themes across three eras of antibiotic resistance research. 
The first era, which coincides with the golden age of antibiotics, was characterized by a 
focus on resistance in pathogens in the clinic, and by the ready supply of new antibiotics and 
the diverse antibiotic mechanisms of action. In this era, drawing inspiration from Koch, the 
research priority was on single resistance genes and enzymes primarily from pathogenic 
organisms in axenic culture. In the second era of antibiotic resistance studies, we became 
less restricted by Koch’s postulates and shifted our attention to resistomes. The 
antibiotic resistance of both benign and pathogenic bacteria was studied at the microbial 
community level, and metagenomic approaches were incorporated to discover resistance 
determinants from diverse habitats. As we enter the next era of antibiotic resistance research, 
we should acknowledge the ubiquity of antibiotic resistance, and take steps to improve the 
development of new antibiotic therapies and the surveillance of emerging resistance threats, 
focusing on resistance genes that are the most likely candidates for horizontal transfer to 
pathogens. In the remainder of this Review, we provide brief overviews of these three eras of 
resistome studies, and we outline how distinct philosophies from each of these eras could be 
integrated to improve the translational effect of resistome research going forwards.
The golden age of antibiotics
Both Sir Alexander Fleming and Gerhard Domagk, who discovered penicillin and prontosil, 
respectively, warned of the danger of bacterial resistance developing following improper use 
of their antibiotics20,21. One of the first reports of antibiotic resistance was the finding that a 
cell-free extract from a coliform bacterium that was unaffected by penicillin was able to 
inactivate penicillin, which indicated enzymatic degradation of the drug22. In the following 
decades, the extensive use of penicillin in hospitals led to the development of widespread

 resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and resulted in the 1953 penicillin-resistant S. aureus 
phage-type 80/81 pandemic, which represented the world’s first superbug until the release of 
methicillin ended the threat23. Soon after, the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of 
Shigella spp., following apparent horizontal gene transfer from faecal strains of E. coli, was 
reported. Remarkably, there was evidence that such transfers occurred in hospitalized 
patients during the course of their antibiotic treatment24.
The first era of resistance studies was concomitant with the golden age of antibiotics. During 
this period, all of the major modern classes of antibiotic were discovered. Within years, 
many were rendered obsolete in at least some organisms owing to the acquisition and spread 
of resistance17. For a period of time, novel or previously known mechanisms of resistance 
that arose in new pathogens were commonly dealt with by developing and releasing a new 
antibiotic. Indeed, resistant bacteria were even welcomed by Domagk as an opportunity to 
increase the antibiotic market share20. During this era, resistance genes and bacteria were 
largely identified one gene and one strain at a time using culture-based methods. This low-
throughput approach, combined with incompletely exhausted reserves of natural antibiotics, 
disguised the otherwise apparent threat that antibiotic-resistant bacteria were destined to 
become.
High-throughput resistance discovery
The second era of resistome studies has been characterized by a broader ecological view of 
resistance, which was enabled by several breakthrough technologies. In the past few 
decades, the development of the new ecological resistome philosophy that recognizes the 
environment as the plausible original source of resistance genes and as the reservoir of 
resistance gene diversity has been driven by the technical advances in molecular biology and 
nucleic acid sequencing.
Sequencing-based resistance discovery
The development of genomic techniques that enable the culture-independent study of diverse 
environmental microbial communities has been a crucial driver of the paradigm shift in 
resistome studies25–28. This is illustrated by the growth of the catalogue of known resistance 
genes, which has occurred alongside a rapid decrease in sequencing costs. A survey of 
resistance proteins in the UniProt database29 demonstrates that since 1986 there has been an 
exponential increase in the number of hypothetical resistance determinants classified as β-
lactamases, chloram phenicol acetyltransferases or tetracycline efflux pumps (FIG. 2a). The 
surfeit of sequencing data exemplifies the second era of resistance studies but in many cases, 
the lack of functional validation of these genes calls into question whether all of them are 
resistance determinants. Similarly, the sequence diversity that is captured using cutting-edge 
techniques may not translate into functional diversity. One technique that has proven useful 
in the discovery of resistance determinants that are novel, diverse and validated is functional 
metagenomics (BOX 3), which is a technique that has been developed to mine metagenomes 
for various phenotypes without a need for culturing30. Functional metagenomics has proven 
to be essential for the characterization of antibiotic resistomes. Briefly, this technique 
consists of cloning metagenomic DNA into expression vectors and screening for a

 phenotype of interest (for example, antibiotic resistance) in a facile host organism. This 
bypasses the bottleneck that is imposed by bacteria that are difficult to culture and explicitly 
selects for genes that can spread by horizontal transfer, as only phenotypes that are 
transferable to a heterologous host are detected. However, antibiotic resistance that results 
from mutation of the antibiotic target, which is an important contributor to resistance in 
many organisms, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis31,32, may not always be detected in 
functional metagenomic screens, as a single wild-type copy of these genes in the expression 
host often confers a dominant susceptible phenotype. This is the case for quinolone 
resistance that results from mutations in the DNA gyrase enzyme31, although the analysis of 
evolutionary patterns in such genes may enable antibiotic resistance risk estimates to be 
made33–35. Furthermore, the artificial action of extracting and cloning DNA can lead to the 
transfer of genes that otherwise might not be mobilizable, which possibly raises concerns in 
regard to the spread of resistance in cases in which the actual risk may be low, but it may 
also result in the underestimation of sequences related to mobility elements, which are not 
explicitly selected for in screens for antibiotic resistance.
The coupling of functional metagenomic selections with high-throughput sequencing and 
computational methods has facilitated an increase in our ability to catalogue resistomes from 
diverse habitats. Importantly, functional metagenomics can both ascribe a resistance function 
to known genes that were not previously identified as resistance determinants and discover 
resistance genes with novel sequences. For example, a recent analysis of functionally 
discovered resistance genes found that although many of the gene products had high amino 
acid identity to known enzymes, most had low identity to known resistance determinants36 
(FIG. 2b). Similarly, the utility of functional metagenomics in elucidating entirely new 
resistance functions is highlighted by its recent application to the discovery of novel 
rifamycin phosphorylases37, dihydrofolate reductases38 and tetracycline-inactivating 
enzymes39.
The resistomes of different habitats
Functional metagenomics was first described in 2000 as a method for accessing the diverse 
biochemical activities encoded in the uncultured soil metagenome30. In an early application 
of functional metagenomics for the explicit purpose of screening for antibiotic resistance 
genes, a library that contained 5.4 Gb of metagenomic DNA from a remnant oak savannah 
site was selected against a panel of aminoglycoside antibiotics, as well as tetracycline and 
nalidixic acid40. Sequencing of 10 resistant clones revealed that all but one contained novel 
resistance determinants. Since these initial studies, functional metagenomics has been 
widely used to screen a diverse range of soil metagenomes, including remote arctic 
soils41–43, apple orchard soils44, alluvial soils45,46, wetland soils47, agricultural soils38,48 
and urban soils49, and has identified novel genes that confer resistance to diverse classes of 
antibiotic. Agricultural resistomes are of particular interest because the selective pressures of 
heavy antibiotic use and extensive anthropogenic interaction make this a high-risk habitat for 
antibiotic resistance selection and dissemination. Indeed, the mcr1 plasmid-mediated colistin 
resistance determinant was first discovered on a Chinese pig farm50, although it has since 
been detected in new and banked clinical and environmental samples across the globe51–59 
(BOX 2).

 In addition to soil habitats, human-associated resistomes have been a recent focus of 
functional metagenomic investigations. The first human-associated microbial community to 
be queried for antibiotic resistance by functional metagenomic selection was the oral 
microbiome. Screening of a small functional library constructed from dental plaque and 
saliva samples against tetracycline resulted in the discovery of tet(37), a gene that encodes a 
tetracycline-inactivating enzyme that has low sequence identity to any previously described 
tetracycline resistance determinant, as well as other resistance genes60. A larger follow-up 
study revealed resistance against tetracycline, gentamicin and amoxicillin in the oral 
microbiome61. The first report of a functional metagenomic interrogation of the human gut 
resistome screened metagenomic DNA from saliva and stool samples from two healthy 
humans against a panel of 13 antibiotics62. Sequencing of 95 unique inserts, which together 
conferred resistance to all of the 13 antibiotics that were screened, revealed that they were 
largely dissimilar to the closest known resistance genes. For example, 10 novel β-lactamases 
were identified in just two gut microbiomes. Remarkably, these microbiomes encompassed 
greater phylogenetic β-lactamase diversity than all previously described β-lactamases (FIG. 
2c). Additional studies have examined the gut microbiomes of diverse human populations, 
including healthy adults63, healthy twins and their mothers18,64,65, preterm infants36, 
uncontacted antibiotic-naive Amerindians10, and families, as well as livestock and pets, from 
developing countries in Latin America66. Importantly, these studies have made it clear that, 
although the resident human-associated resistome is enriched after antibiotic therapy36, the 
gut contains an extensive resistome even in the absence of anthropogenic antibiotic use10,66.
Limitations of resistome studies
Although these studies are extremely valuable in cataloguing the genetic diversity of the 
global resistome, they have been largely descriptive or focused on collecting data, and thus 
require substantial downstream mechanistic validation. It is important to emphasize that just 
because a gene confers resistance when it is overexpressed in a heterologous host, it may not 
be a bona fide resistance gene in the original host. Indeed, nuanced definitions of antibiotic 
resistance should consider the function of resistance determinants in their native contexts 
and the risk of transmission of resistance determinants between bacterial species35. There is 
extensive evidence that resistome composition is strongly correlated with the phylogenetic 
structure of a microbial community, and that the synteny of antibiotic resistance genes with 
mobility elements is observed less frequently in environmental meta genomes (for example, 
those from soil) than in sequenced pathogen genomes48,67 (FIG. 1b). Nonetheless, the 
discovery of identical resistance genes in multiple genomic and environmental contexts 
suggests historical transfer and/or dissemination events. For example, a recent functional 
metagenomic study identified an identical TEM-1 β-lactamase in 25 different habitats and 
genetic backgrounds66 (FIG. 1a). This research, when viewed in light of recent emerging 
resistance threats (BOX 2), emphasizes that although not all resistance genes are threats for 
widespread dissemination, we should pay close attention to the ones that are. A focus of 
future studies on antibiotic resistomes should be the quantification of risk of horizontal gene 
transfer to pathogens based on ‘metadata’ associated with a given resistance gene (for 
example, synteny with mobility elements, whether it is plasmid-borne or chromosomal, and 
whether it is found in a close relative of a human pathogen) to model the risk of 
transmission34,35.

 Next-generation approaches to resistance
Strategies to combat antibiotic resistance will require substantial changes both to the 
antibiotic pipeline and stewardship practices, and to antibiotic resistance surveillance. The 
ubiquity of antibiotic resistance suggests that the drug development pipeline must include 
proactive screens for existing environmental resistance threats to new drugs and should 
explore alternative strategies for combating resistance outside of the traditional antibiotic 
pipeline. In addition, it is the responsibility of the wider medical and scientific communities 
to apply and combine the findings from the first two eras of resistome studies in efforts to 
surveil potential antibiotic resistance hotspots for emerging resistance threats before they 
spread.
Next-generation therapeutics
A key aspect that requires investigation in the next generation of antibiotic resistance studies 
is the proactive development of therapeutic strategies to counteract emerging antibiotic 
resistance. One side of this approach involves having a greater focus on resistance potential 
when developing new and improved antibiotics. Current antibiotic discovery and 
development pipelines only take into account resistance mechanisms that are already 
prevalent in the clinic. In retrospect, we know that this strategy is doomed to fail, as 
resistance has been observed for every antibiotic that has been implemented for human 
use17. Going forwards, we should improve on the current reactive strategies by screening 
promising lead compounds for resistance against diverse functional metagenomic libraries. 
This will identify existing mechanisms of resistance that are likely to disseminate to the 
clinical setting following the introduction of the antibiotic for clinical use (FIG. 3).
In the near future, our understanding of the resistome will be sufficiently mature to enable 
the development of strategies that actively combat resistance mechanisms themselves in 
contrast to current strategies that side-step resistance through the expensive development of 
new antibiotics that immediately select for new mechanisms of resistance. This new 
approach, in our opinion, provides a higher likelihood of success than searching for a fabled 
‘silver bullet’ antibiotic to which resistance is unlikely to develop. One such strategy is the 
repurposing of existing antibiotics in synergistic combinations. For example, consider the 
triple β-lactam combination of meropenem, piperacillin and tazobactam, which 
synergistically kills methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) N315 in vitro and in a mouse 
infection model68. The bacteria were collaterally sensitive to the combination of 
these three antibiotics, and thus the combination suppressed the evolution of further 
resistance68. Treatment regimens that induce collateral sensitivity not only enable the 
elimination of resistant bacteria but also subject resistant bacteria to selective pressure to 
discard their resistance gene69. Inverting the selective advantage of antibiotic resistance is a 
promising approach for slowing the rate at which resistance evolves in a population. A 
recent highlight in the search for selection-inverting compounds involved a screen of nearly 
20,000 small molecules for compounds that select against the tetracycline efflux pump TetA. 
This screen identified two candidates that successfully selected for the loss of the tetA 
gene70. Perhaps more important are drugs under development and in early-phase testing that 
target AcrA–AcrB–TolC efflux complexes in Gram-negative bacteria. Unlike TetA proteins,

 which are tetra cycline-specific, AcrA–AcrB–TolC pumps have broad substrate tolerance 
and can confer multidrug resistance, particularly in Gram-negative bacteria71.
A final strategy that has already proven to be effective in opposing widespread resistance is 
the inhibition of antibiotic resistance enzymes72. Small molecules that lack antibiotic 
activity but enhance the efficacy of antibiotic therapy are broadly termed antibiotic 
adjuvants73. β-Lactamase inhibitors and TetA efflux selection inversion70,72,74 fall in this 
category, as do promising examples from recent studies that paired antibiotics with 
repurposed drugs that are already on the market for other indications, such as the opioid-
receptor agonist loperamide, which facilitates tetracycline uptake, and the ADP receptor 
antagonist ticlopidine, which inhibits teichoic acid biosynthesis3,73,75,76. The continued 
discovery of antibiotic adjuvants is facilitated and informed by resistome studies that 
comprehensively describe the collection of possible resistance genes. For example, consider 
the recently described E. coli-hosted array of more than 40 mechanistically distinct and 
functionally validated resistance genes77. This platform, which represented resistance to 16 
classes of antibiotics, was used to screen a limited small-molecule library for compounds 
that could enhance the antibiotic activity of gentamicin. Of the 27 compounds that exhibited 
this activity, eight were found to inhibit aminoglycoside-2″-O-nucleotidyltransferase 
(ANT(2″)-Ia)-mediated resistance. Two compounds that were selected for further validation 
exhibited poor antibiotic activity alone and were confirmed to inhibit ANT(2″)-Ia in vitro. 
By screening drug combinations against a phenotypic resistome array, the authors were able 
to identify inhibitors of antibiotic resistance genes, thus demonstrating the utility of 
leveraging resistome data to discover adjuvants that can prolong the efficacy of existing 
antibiotics77.
Next-generation surveillance
Lastly, it is important to prioritize continued and increased surveillance of the antibiotic 
resistome, particularly hotspots in which there is a high likelihood of resistance gene 
evolution and transfer between organisms (FIG. 3). These hotspots include, but are not 
limited to, agricultural settings in which large quantities of antibiotics and human pathogens, 
as well as environmental microorganisms, coexist and potentially exchange DNA50; 
hospitals in which selective pressure is omnipresent owing to the extensive use of antibiotics 
and antimicrobials, which may co-select for antibiotic resistance24; and wastewater and 
sewage systems, which directly expose the human gut microbiota to many pharmaceutical 
residues66. Surveillance requires regular testing of pathogens, commensals and microbial 
communities for resistance to a broad range of antibiotics. This can occur using culture-
dependent or genomic approaches, and necessarily entails the continued development of 
technologies that will facilitate the identification of antibiotic resistance determinants.
Recent computational and bioinformatic advances have substantially improved our ability to 
identify antibiotic resistance genes from PCR amplicons and whole-genome sequencing 
(WGS)27. These databases contain nucleotide or protein sequences for known antibiotic 
resistance determinants, and can be queried (by BLAST78, for example) to identify the 
antibiotic resistance genes that are present in a given genome or metagenome. However, 
these functional predictions are explicitly based only on sequence data and are vulnerable to 
Crofts et al.

 false-positive predictions, particularly when functional assignments are based on annotations 
that have not themselves been directly validated biochemically or phenotypically. A key 
component of our ability to annotate and predict antibiotic resistance genes from genomic 
data is the continued improvement of antibiotic resistance gene databases through functional 
validation79–84. In addition, improved probabilistic annotation algorithms, such as profile 
hidden Markov models, have been shown to perform substantially better than pairwise 
sequence alignment in terms of precision and recall85,86.
For example, Resfams, a curated database of 166 profile hidden Markov models that were 
constructed from functionally validated families of antibiotic resistance proteins, correctly 
predicted 45% more β-lactamases in functionally selected metagenomic contigs than 
BLAST alignment to antibiotic resistance databases84. In other studies, nucleotide sequences 
from metagenomic datasets were used to computationally predict qnr genes that might 
confer resistance to quinolone87,88. Although qnr genes have low similarity to other 
resistance determinants and relatively high in-family diversity, the authors were able to 
discover and functionally verify several novel variants87,88. As a result of the development 
of these tools, we are now able to more confidently identify both transferable and intrinsic 
resistance determinants from genomes and metagenomes. Going forwards, it is important 
that these databases are regularly updated with the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of 
functionally validated, emerging resistance determinants (FIG. 3).
Despite these advances, the prediction of resistance phenotype on the basis of genotype 
remains a challenge. WGS-based methods are a promising approach to improve the speed 
and accuracy of diagnostics89–91. An additional advantage of WGS-based diagnostics is the 
possibility for the improved identification of antibiotic resistance by target modification, 
which is often not feasible using existing PCR-based or microarray-based methods91–93. A 
current highlight of sequencing-based diagnostics is the Mykrobe predictor, which identified 
antibiotic susceptibility profiles for 12 antibiotics from raw, unassembled Illumina 
sequencing data from S. aureus and M. tuberculosis isolates, as well as from in silico-
simulated heterogeneous populations, with high sensitivity and specificity94. A recently 
described alternative approach uses draft genome assemblies as inputs and a machine-
learning approach to accurately predict resistance profiles for multidrug-resistant 
Enterobacteriaceae isolates86. Although it is currently cost-prohibitive and time-prohibitive 
to use WGS as a clinical diagnostic tool, continued reductions in sequencing costs and 
improvements in computational algorithms may soon make this approach feasible. Faster 
and more accurate diagnostics will considerably decrease the number of empirical and 
unsuitable antibiotic prescriptions, thus limiting further selection for resistance (FIG. 3).
Two recent examples from the literature highlight the importance of surveillance efforts as 
we attempt to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance. These examples pertain to the 
current last-resort antibiotics against carbapenem-resistant members of the 
Enterobacteriaceae: namely, colistin and tigecycline. The first example is the emergence of 
the mcr1 gene as a transmissible threat to colistin use. The seminal example of a plasmid-
borne colistin-resistance gene was found through an active surveillance programme in China 
that monitored antimicrobial resistance in animals that were reared to be consumed by 
humans50. Soon after its discovery, several retrospective studies demonstrated that plasmid-

 borne mcr1 had already spread worldwide and into the clinic95 (BOX 2). In this case, 
surveillance provided crucial early detection. The second example of the importance of 
surveillance relates to tigecycline, a semi-synthetic tetracycline antibiotic96. Owing to 
its increased affinity for the bacterial ribosome compared with other tetracyclines, and to the 
presence of a glycyl tail, tigecycline is subject to reduced resistance through ribosomal 
protection or drug efflux97. However, tigecycline is sensitive to the tetracycline-inactivating 
protein TetX98. Although this protein was originally discovered in Bacteroides fragilis — a 
usually non-pathogenic human gut commensal — several clinical isolates have recently 
tested positive for tetX99,100, and tetracycline inactivation has been discovered to be more 
widespread in environmental metagenomes than was previously thought39. Continued 
surveillance of this apparent emerging resistance mechanism is prudent, as tigecycline and 
other next-generation tetracycline derivatives are being designed to exclusively evade 
resistance through ribosomal protection and efflux101,102. The increased use of next-
generation tetracyclines imposes a strong selective pressure on the acquisition and spread of 
tetracycline-inactivating enzymes from the environmental resistome. Foresight of this event 
should enable the proactive development of next-generation therapeutic strategies before the 
widespread dissemination of a resistance threat.
Conclusions
Extensive study of the antibiotic resistome throughout the past few decades has enabled us 
to begin to understand and address existing antibiotic resistance threats. However, it is 
evident that antibiotic resistance will continue to evolve and spread despite our best efforts 
to develop new antibacterial agents. Unless current practice is changed, it will be 
increasingly difficult to establish and maintain even a transient lead over bacteria in this 
‘arms race’. As research into antibiotic resistance expands, it is important to adopt an 
explicitly proactive approach to antibiotic resistance identification and surveillance, as well 
as antibiotic therapy development. This proactive approach involves using a combination of 
functional metagenomics, next-generation sequencing and cutting-edge 
computational methods to monitor the evolution and dissemination of resistance before a 
given resistance determinant emerges in a pathogen or in the clinical setting, as well as 
proactively developing next-generation therapies that target these resistance determinants. 
The spread of plasmid-borne carbapenem, quinolone and polymyxin resistance in recent 
years is a sobering reminder of our need to mitigate existing threats and to anticipate 
emerging resistance mechanisms before they circulate widely in the clinical setting if we 
wish to alter the current bleak antibiotic resistance trajectory. Recent advances in the field 
highlight the promise that the next generation of resistome studies hold for characterizing 
and countering emerging resistance threats.

Glossary
Antibiotics
Drugs that inhibit the growth of bacteria or kill them
Natural products
Small molecules that are naturally produced by living organisms
Proto-resistance genes
Genes that have the potential to evolve a resistance function
Cryptic resistance genes
A resistance gene that is embedded in a bacterial chromosome, but that is not obviously 
associated with antibiotic resistance. The respective gene is usually either not expressed or 
expressed at low levels
Metagenomes
The collective genetic material in a given environment
Synteny
The occurrence of multiple genes in the same genetic locus
Horizontal gene transfer
The transmission of genetic material between bacterial organisms by transformation, 
transduction or conjugation, in contrast to vertical transmission through heredity
Axenic
A term that describes a culture that contains only a single species
Koch’s postulates
A series of criteria proposed by Robert Koch in 1890 that can be used to establish a causal 
relationship between a microorganism and a disease
Collaterally sensitive
A term that describes organisms that develop resistance to one antibiotic and, as a result of 
the new mutation, are more sensitive to another antibiotic
PCR
A molecular biology technique that is used to amplify nucleic acids of known sequence
Whole-genome sequencing

Common mechanisms of antibiotic action and antibiotic resistance
Antibiotic targets are generally conserved across the bacterial domain of life, and are 
absent from or sufficiently different in eukaryotes. Although hundreds of such targets 
exist in theory, our current antibiotic arsenal generally attacks the bacterial ribosome 
(inhibiting protein synthesis; for example, aminoglycosides); cell wall synthesis and lipid 
membrane integrity (compromising membrane integrity or lysing bacterial cells; for 
example, β-lactams); single-carbon metabolic pathways (inducing metabolic disruption; 
for example, sulfonamides); and DNA maintenance (interfering with bacterial replication 
and genomic integrity; for example, quinolones)2,17,103 (see the figure, top).
Bacteria typically resort to one of a few common strategies to resist antibiotics104 (see the 
figure, bottom). One resistance mechanism involves the inactivation of the antibiotic 
through enzymatic degradation or modification of the antibiotic scaffold, which renders it 
ineffective. Examples of this mechanism include chloramphenicol acetyltransferases105, 
tetracycline-inactivating enzymes such as TetX39,106 and, most notably, the widespread 
β-lactamases107,108. A second strategy for resistance is protection, alteration or 
overexpression of the antibiotic target. This approach is used by vancomycin-resistant 
enterococci, which enzymatically modify peptidoglycan, thus decreasing the affinity of 
vancomycin for its target109, and by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
(MRSA), which expresses a redundant methicillin-insensitive variant of the native 
penicillin-binding protein110. Two additional resistance mechanisms rely on keeping the 
antibiotic out of the bacterial cell, through either efflux or altering the permeability of the 
cell membrane. By expressing either a generalist multidrug efflux pump111–114 or an 
antibiotic-specific exporter, such as tetracycline efflux pumps115, bacteria keep the 
intracellular concentration of the antibiotic below inhibitory levels. Alternatively, some 
bacteria reduce their cell membrane or cell wall permeability to prevent antibiotics from 
entering the cell by decreasing porin expression or expressing a more selective porin 
variant116,117. In some cases, bacteria will use several complementary mechanisms to 
achieve high levels of resistance. For example, high-level carbapenem resistance in 
clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae that lack any known carbapenemase can be 
achieved through a combination of porin mutations that decrease carbapenem uptake and 
increased expression of a chromosomal non-carbapenemase β-lactamase118.

Global spread of plasmid-borne resistance
In the past several decades, various new antibiotic resistance threats have emerged and 
spread worldwide. In particular, the emergence and spread of plasmid-borne resistance 
genes (see the figure and Supplementary information S1 (table) for specific reports of 
plasmid-borne resistance) — which are likely to undergo horizontal gene transfer — have 
jeopardized many last-line antibiotic therapies, including the cephalosporin and 
carbapenem families of β-lactam antibiotics, quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, and an 
antibiotic of last resort, colistin5. Cephalosporins have been compromised by resistance 
owing to extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), which were first reported in 1979 
(REF.119), and subsequently spread phylogenetically across the Enterobacteriaceae and 
geographically across the globe120. Consequently, many infections that were previously 
treated by drugs such as cefotaxime must now be treated with the carbapenem class of 
antibiotics. However, the spread of carbapenemases121 — particularly New Delhi 
metallo-β-lactamase 1 (NDM1)122–124 and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases 
(KPCs)125 since their respective discoveries in 2006 and 2001 — has also rendered the 
carbapenem class of antibiotics vulnerable126 (see the figure).
A similar development has been observed for the quinolones, which were originally 
touted to be at low risk of displaying the type of transferable resistance that has 
beleaguered the β-lactam antibiotics. Indeed, whereas chromosomal resistance to this 
class of antibiotic can readily develop through mutations in DNA gyrase, transferable 
resistance was slow to develop following the clinical introduction of these antibiotics in 
the 1960s. Nonetheless, plasmid-mediated resistance through the quinolone resistance 
(QNR) proteins, first described in 1998, has emerged from quinolone overuse and has 
subsequently spread worldwide (see the figure). In the search for the origins of QNR 
resistance determinants, a PCR screen of Gram-negative organisms found homologues in 
the aquatic bacterium Shewanella algae that have almost 99% amino acid identity127. 
Shewanella species that lack these homologues were found to have a fourfold to eightfold 
greater sensitivity to quinolone antibiotics than those that expressed these homologues, 
which indicates the ability of the qnr-related genes to confer some antibiotic resistance 
even in their native contexts, in which they probably bind to DNA for some other 
purpose2,127. The hypothesized horizontal transfer of qnr homologues from 
environmental to pathogenic bacteria corroborates hypotheses that propose that many 
resistance genes may have been co-opted by pathogens from the environmental 
resistome13,14,127,128. Quinolone efficacy has been further reduced by the emergence of 
the plasmid-borne bifunctional aminoglycoside and quinolone resistance gene aac(6′)-Ib-
cr in Shanghai in 2003 (REF.129). This gene, which differs from that encoding a classical 
aminoglycoside transferase by only two base pairs, is notable in its ability to modify 
fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides through acetylation. Alarmingly, aac(6′)-Ib-cr is 
often colocalized with other resistance genes, such as ESBLs130, on multidrug resistance 
plasmids.
The spread of the aforementioned resistance mechanisms leaves only a few classes of 
antibiotic approved for the treatment of infection by carbapenem-resistant members of

 the Enterobacteriaceae. One of these, the polymyxin class of peptide antibiotics, was first 
used in the 1960s but was abandoned in favour of other antibiotics owing to its toxicity. 
Recently, the use of the polymyxin colistin has been revived owing to its efficacy against 
several multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens131. However, transferable resistance 
has now begun to threaten colistin. In 2015, a colistin-resistant Escherichia coli isolate 
from a pig farm in Shanghai was found to contain mcr1 — a plasmid-borne gene that 
encodes a phosphoethanolamine transferase50. This finding, and the subsequent discovery 
of mcr1 on plasmids worldwide51–59 (see the figure), foreshadows the fall of colistin as a 
last-resort antibiotic that lacks transferable plasmid-encoded resistance. With the high 
levels of antibiotic prescription in medicine and unregulated antibiotic use in agriculture 
around the world it is likely that it is only a matter of time before completely pan-
resistant plasmids are found that combine the above resistance mechanisms. Indeed, the 
coexistence of NDM1 and MCR1 in members of the Enterobacteriaceae has already been 
observed55,132, and a recent report documented the co-transfer of mcr1 and ndm5 on a 
mobile hybrid IncX3–X4 plasmid133.

Functional metagenomic approaches for characterizing resistomes
Functional metagenomics is a powerful culture-unbiased and sequence-unbiased tool134. 
A metagenomic library is created by extracting total metagenomic DNA from a microbial 
community, shearing the DNA to a target size distribution and cloning these fragments en 
masse into a screening vector (see the figure). The metagenomic library is then 
transformed into a heterologous host and selected for a phenotype of interest by, for 
example, culturing with antibiotics at a concentration that is lethal to the wild-type 
host27,135. Pairing functional metagenomic selection with next-generation sequencing 
and better sequence assembly and annotation algorithms14 has simultaneously decreased 
the cost and increased the throughput of functional metagenomic experiments, and this 
has facilitated the characterization of resistomes from diverse habitats10,18,36,48,66. 
Importantly, there is no need to culture members of the target microbial community, and 
novel resistance genes can be discovered. Furthermore, the genes discovered by 
functional metagenomics are, by definition, candidates for horizontal transfer, as they 
must be functional in a heterologous host.
However, there are several limitations of functional metagenomic approaches. For a gene 
to be identified in a functional metagenomic screen, it must be functional in a 
heterologous host. Common hosts, such as Escherichia coli, probably present a poor 
system for the discovery of resistance genes that originated from Gram-positive 
organisms. Indeed, poor overlap has been reported between clones recovered from the 
same functional metagenomic library that were subjected to the same screen but in 
different hosts136,137. In addition, it is generally difficult to screen Gram-positive 
bacteria-specific antibiotics in E. coli or other common Gram-negative platforms owing 
to their innate resistance, although in some cases this may be overcome138. Thus, there is 
a clear need to develop and screen functional libraries in phylogenetically diverse 
heterologous hosts134,139. Furthermore, functional metagenomic experiments may 
oversample resistomes, as the method struggles to distinguish resistance genes that pose 
clinical threats from those that are unlikely to spread beyond their current environment. 
In addition, genes that confer antibiotic resistance when overexpressed in a heterologous 
host may not be genuine resistance genes in their native contexts35. To reduce the risk of 
false-positives, it is important that novel resistance genes are validated using 
complementary microbiological and biochemical methods, and are cross-checked against 
existing databases. Finally, the removal of an antibiotic resistance gene from its genomic 
context often also removes positional information that is pertinent to assessing its risk of 
dissemination. This can be overcome, in part, by altering insert size, as larger inserts may 
contain informative regions that flank resistance genes, including mobility elements or 
plasmid sequences that might indicate the risk of spreading (that is, the 
mobilome)48,66,140.

 Figure 1. The synteny of antibiotic resistance genes provides historical context and foreshadows 
future
The genetic context of antibiotic resistance genes can provide important evidence regarding 
the likelihood of past or future horizontal gene transfer. a | A single β-lactamase (TEM-1) 
was found in 25 different genetic contexts in a recent cross-habitat resistome study, which 
provided a historical record of past mobility. Five contexts are shown here. Habitats in which 
a gene was discovered are indicated on the left (‘human’: human-associated microbial 
community; ‘animal’: animal-associated microbial community; ‘WWTP’: wastewater 
treatment plant; ‘latrine’: composting latrine). b | Four resistance determinants that were 
discovered in functional selections of soil metagenomic libraries (bottom) have high identity 
with resistance genes from clinical pathogenic isolates. Shading indicates >99% nucleotide 
identity, which suggests recent horizontal transfer. Resistance genes in pathogens are 
syntenic with mobility elements and other resistance genes, which suggests that they may be 
present on a mobile multidrug resistance cassette and are therefore likely to undergo 
horizontal gene transfer. DDE, Asp-Asp-Glu. Part a is adapted with permission from REF.66,

 Figure 2. Next-generation sequencing and functional metagenomic selection accelerate the 
cataloguing of known and novel resistance genes
a | The catalogue of resistance genes has increased exponentially in the second era of 
antibiotic resistome studies owing to improvements in next-generation sequencing. This 
trend is exemplified by the tetracycline efflux pump-encoding gene tetA, by the bla family 
encoding β-lactamases and by chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT). Data from the 
UniProt database29, which was accessed on 12 October 2016; the database was searched 
using Enzyme Commission numbers (bla: 3.5.2.6; CAT: 2.3.1.28) or a family name (tetA). 
Data on sequencing costs are from National Human Genome Research Institute webpage28. 
b | Functional metagenomics is a powerful tool for ascribing antibiotic resistance function to 
known gene products. Antibiotic resistance proteins identified by functional metagenomic 
selection of the preterm infant gut microbiome have high amino acid identity to proteins in 
the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database but low amino acid 
identity to proteins in antibiotic resistance databases. c | In addition, functional 
metagenomics can reveal entirely sequence-novel resistance determinants. β-Lactamases 
that were identified by functional metagenomic selection of two human gut resistomes (red 
squares) encompassed greater phylogenetic diversity than all previously identified classes of 
β-lactamase (blue squares). Part b is adapted with permission from REF.36, Macmillan

The wide application of functional metagenomic selections and next-generation sequencing 
will steadily increase our knowledge of functionally annotated antibiotic resistance genes 
and their genetic context. This will enable more intelligent antibiotic resistance surveillance 
and drug design by accounting for specific mechanisms of resistance and the risk of
