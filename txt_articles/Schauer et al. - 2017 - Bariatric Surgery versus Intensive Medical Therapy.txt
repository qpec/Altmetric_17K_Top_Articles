Abstract
BACKGROUND—Long-term results from randomized, controlled trials that compare medical 
therapy with surgical therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes are limited.
METHODS—We assessed outcomes 5 years after 150 patients who had type 2 diabetes and a 
body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 
27 to 43 were randomly assigned to receive intensive medical therapy alone or intensive medical 
therapy plus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. The primary outcome was a 
glycated hemoglobin level of 6.0% or less with or without the use of diabetes medications.
RESULTS—Of the 150 patients who underwent randomization, 1 patient died during the 5-year 
follow-up period; 134 of the remaining 149 patients (90%) completed 5 years of follow-up. At 
baseline, the mean (±SD) age of the 134 patients was 49±8 years, 66% were women, the mean 
glycated hemoglobin level was 9.2±1.5%, and the mean BMI was 37±3.5. At 5 years, the criterion 
for the primary end point was met by 2 of 38 patients (5%) who received medical therapy alone, as 
compared with 14 of 49 patients (29%) who underwent gastric bypass (unadjusted P = 0.01, 
adjusted P = 0.03, P = 0.08 in the intention-to-treat analysis) and 11 of 47 patients (23%) who 
underwent sleeve gastrectomy (unadjusted P = 0.03, adjusted P = 0.07, P = 0.17 in the intention-
to-treat analysis). Patients who underwent surgical procedures had a greater mean percentage 
reduction from baseline in glycated hemoglobin level than did patients who received medical 
therapy alone (2.1% vs. 0.3%, P = 0.003). At 5 years, changes from baseline observed in the 
gastric-bypass and sleeve-gastrectomy groups were superior to the changes seen in the medical-
therapy group with respect to body weight (−23%, −19%, and −5% in the gastric-bypass, sleeve-

 gastrectomy, and medical-therapy groups, respectively), triglyceride level (−40%, −29%, and 
−8%), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (32%, 30%, and 7%), use of insulin (−35%, 
−34%, and −13%), and quality-of-life measures (general health score increases of 17, 16, and 0.3; 
scores on the RAND 36-Item Health Survey ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating 
better health) (P<0.05 for all comparisons). No major late surgical complications were reported 
except for one reoperation.
CONCLUSIONS—Five-year outcome data showed that, among patients with type 2 diabetes and 
a BMI of 27 to 43, bariatric surgery plus intensive medical therapy was more effective than 
intensive medical therapy alone in decreasing, or in some cases resolving, hyperglycemia.
Observational studies1–6 and randomized, controlled trials, which have generally been short-
term studies,7–19 have shown that bariatric surgery, when used specifically to treat diabetes, 
significantly improves glycemic control and reduces cardiovascular risk factors. In the 
Surgical Treatment and Medications Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently 
(STAMPEDE) trial, we reported that, at 1 year and 3 years after randomization, both gastric 
bypass and sleeve gastrectomy were superior to intensive medical therapy alone in achieving 
excellent glycemic control (i.e., glycated hemoglobin ≤6.0%), reducing cardiovascular risk, 
improving quality of life, and decreasing medication use.8–10 The current article provides 
results of the final, 5-year follow-up analyses from that trial and attempts to address 
questions regarding the relative long-term efficacy and safety of bariatric surgery and its 
effects on diabetes-related end-organ disease.
METHODS
TRIAL DESIGN
The rationale, design, and methods of the trial have been reported previously.8,20 The 
complete protocol was approved by the institutional review board at the Cleveland Clinic 
and is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Briefly, the trial was a three-
group, randomized, controlled, nonblinded, single-center study involving 150 obese patients 
who had type 2 diabetes, in which the effects of intensive medical therapy alone were 
compared with those of intensive medical therapy plus either gastric bypass or sleeve 
gastrectomy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three study 
groups, with stratification according to baseline use of insulin. Eligibility criteria included an 
age of 20 to 60 years, a glycated hemoglobin level of more than 7.0%, and a body-mass 
index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 27 to 
43. All the patients provided written informed consent.
TRIAL OUTCOMES
The primary outcome was a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.0% or less with or without the 
use of diabetes medications.8,10,20 Prespecified secondary outcomes included measures of 
glycemic control, weight loss, blood pressure, lipid levels, renal function, ophthalmologic 
outcomes, medication use, adverse events, and quality of life (as evaluated with the use of 
the RAND 36-Item Health Survey).21 Methods for ophthalmologic evaluations are reported 
in the protocol.22 The strategy for all three groups was the adjustment of intensive medical 
therapy (every 3 months for 2 years and every 6 months thereafter) with the goal of

 achieving a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.0% or less, without unacceptable side effects 
associated with medical treatment. Patients in the surgical groups were instructed to take 
daily supplemental multivitamins, vitamin B12, vitamin D, calcium, and iron.
TRIAL OVERSIGHT
This investigator-initiated trial was financially supported by Ethicon, with additional support 
from LifeScan, the Cleveland Clinic, and the National Institutes of Health. The sponsors had 
no role in the accrual or analysis of the data or in the preparation of the manuscript. The first 
author wrote the initial draft of the manuscript. All the authors had independent access to the 
data and vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and for the fidelity of the trial 
to the protocol. Complete trial governance is outlined in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available at NEJM.org.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We used Pearson’s chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test to evaluate the glycated hemoglobin 
level at clinical cutoff points of 6.0% or less (primary end point), 6.5% or less, and 7.0% or 
less. The primary population for analysis comprised patients who had undergone 
randomization and had glycated hemoglobin values at the 5-year visit; these patients were 
considered to have completed the trial. We also performed an imputed intention-to-treat 
analysis, which included all patients who underwent randomization (150 patients). An 
analysis of variance was used to analyze the change from baseline to year 5 for the 
secondary end points. We created graphs for glycemic measures and BMI over time by 
plotting the least-squares means and corresponding standard errors from a mixed model, 
using treatment assignment, visit, and the interaction between treatment assignment and visit 
as fixed factors. A stepwise multivariable logistic model was used to determine key baseline 
factors associated with achieving the primary end point. Finally, a logistic model examined 
the association between the percentage of weight loss at 1 year and the primary end point of 
a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.0% or less at 5 years. Analyses were performed with the 
use of SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute). Additional details are available in the 
Supplementary Appendix and the protocol.
RESULTS
TRIAL PATIENTS
Of the 150 patients who underwent randomization from March 2007 through January 2011, 
a total of 9 patients never started the assigned treatment and withdrew from the trial 
immediately after randomization or during the initial 6 months after randomization (8 
patients in the medical-therapy group and 1 patient in the sleeve-gastrectomy group); 6 
patients were lost to follow-up. One patient in the medical-therapy group died from 
myocardial infarction during year 4. Overall, 134 of the 150 patients (89%) were included in 
the 5-year assessment. One patient in the medical-therapy group, in whom a glycated 
hemoglobin level of more than 9% had been reported, underwent gastric bypass during year 
3, owing to failure of the medical treatment. One patient in the sleeve-gastrectomy group 
underwent gastric bypass during year 4 for the treatment of a gastric fistula.

 The baseline characteristics of the 150 patients who underwent randomization were reported 
previously.8 In the current analysis of 134 patients, 66% of the patients were women. The 
mean (±SD) age was 49±8 years, and the mean BMI was 37±3.5; 49 patients (37%) had a 
BMI of less than 35. The mean glycated hemoglobin level was 9.2±1.5%, and the mean 
duration of diabetes was 8.4±5.2 years, with 44% of patients requiring insulin at baseline. 
There were no significant differences at baseline among the three groups (Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
PRIMARY END POINT
Among the 134 patients who completed 5 years of follow-up, a glycated hemoglobin level of 
6.0% or less at 5 years was achieved in 2 of 38 patients (5%) in the medical-therapy group, 
as compared with 14 of 49 patients (29%) in the gastric-bypass group (P = 0.01) and 11 of 
47 patients (23%) in the sleeve-gastrectomy group (P = 0.03) (Table 1). After adjustment for 
multiple comparisons, the respective P values changed from 0.01 to 0.03 and from 0.03 to 
0.07, respectively. When we performed an imputed intention-to-treat analysis that included 
all 150 patients who underwent randomization, including the 16 patients who had missing 
final values on glycated hemoglobin level, the respective P values changed to 0.08 and 0.17, 
respectively (with the use of the multiple imputation procedure in SAS software), 0.002 and 
0.006 (with minimum value imputation), and 0.003 and 0.02 (with mean value imputation); 
further details are provided in Additional Statistical Methods and in Table S8, both in the 
Supplementary Appendix. A duration of diabetes of less than 8 years and random 
assignment to gastric bypass alone were the only significant predictors of achieving a 
glycated hemoglobin level of 6.0% or less (P = 0.007 and P = 0.03, respectively) (Table S2 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The percentage of weight loss at 1 year was significantly 
associated with achieving the primary end point at 5 years (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence 
interval, 1.04 to 1.16; P<0.001). Relapse of glycemic control (all groups), which was defined 
as having met the primary end point of a glycated hemoglobin level of 6% or less at 1 year 
but not at 5 years, was not associated with weight regain (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
GLYCEMIC CONTROL
After 5 years, each of the two surgical procedures was superior to intensive medical therapy 
alone with respect to achievement of the exploratory targets for glycated hemoglobin of 6% 
or less without the use of diabetes medications (remission), 6.5% or less without the use of 
diabetes medications, and 7.0% or less with the use of diabetes medications (P<0.05 for all 
comparisons) (Table 1). The decreases from baseline in median fasting plasma glucose 
levels were greater in the two surgical groups than in the medical-therapy group (P<0.05 for 
both comparisons) (Table 1). There were more rapid, larger, and more sustained reductions 
in the levels of glycated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose, in BMI, and in the use of 
glucose-lowering medications in the two surgical groups than in the medical-therapy group 
(Fig. 1A, 1B, and 1C; and Table S3 and Figs. S1 through S5 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The reductions in glycated hemoglobin levels and BMI in the surgical groups 
were similar among patients with a BMI of less than 35 and those with a BMI of 35 or more 
(Fig. 1D, and Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Additional secondary end points are 
shown in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix.

 MEDICATION USE
At 5 years, the use of cardiovascular and glucose-lowering medications, including insulin, 
was reduced from baseline in the two surgical groups, and patients in the surgical groups 
required significantly fewer such medications than did patients in the medical-therapy group 
at 5 years (Fig. 1B, and Table S4 and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
percentage of patients who were not taking any glucose-lowering medications was 
significantly higher in the gastric-bypass group than in the sleeve-gastrectomy group 
(P<0.05) (Fig. 1B, and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Approximately 89% of 
patients in the surgical groups were not taking insulin at 5 years and maintained an average 
glycated hemoglobin level of 7.0%, whereas only 61% of patients in the medical-therapy 
group were not taking insulin at 5 years, with an average glycated hemoglobin level of 8.5%.
WEIGHT LOSS
At 5 years, reductions in body weight, BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio 
were greater after gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy than after intensive medical therapy 
(P<0.05 for all comparisons) (Table 1 and Fig. 1C, and Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The reduction in body weight was greater after gastric bypass than after sleeve 
gastrectomy (P = 0.01).
LIPID LEVELS AND BLOOD PRESSURE
The decrease from baseline in triglyceride levels and the increase from baseline in high-
density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were significantly greater at 5 years after the 
two surgical procedures than after intensive medical therapy (Table 1). No significant 
differences in blood pressure or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were observed 
among the three study groups, although the number of medications needed to treat 
hyperlipidemia and hypertension was significantly lower in the surgical groups than in the 
medical-therapy group (Table 1 and Fig. 1B, and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
RENAL OUTCOMES
At 5 years, the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (as measured in milligrams of albumin to 
grams of creatinine) had decreased significantly from baseline in the sleeve-gastrectomy 
group (P<0.001) only and was significantly lower in the sleeve-gastrectomy group than in 
the medical-therapy group (P<0.001) (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). No 
significant changes from baseline in the rates of albuminuria were observed in any group at 
5 years. Other measures of renal function, including serum creatinine level and glomerular 
filtration rate, are included in Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix.
OPHTHALMOLOGIC OUTCOMES
No significant change from baseline in retinopathy scores, the incidence of macular edema, 
or visual acuity was observed in any study group. In addition, no significant differences in 
these ophthalmologic end points were seen among the three groups at 5 years (Tables S6a, 
S6b, and S6c in the Supplementary Appendix).

 QUALITY OF LIFE
Scores on each domain of the RAND 36-Item Health Survey range from 0 to 100, with 
higher scores indicating better health. Among patients in the gastric-bypass and sleeve-
gastrectomy groups as compared with the medical-therapy group, significant mean (±SD) 
changes from baseline in general health scores (17±20, 16±22, and 0.3±16, respectively; 
P<0.05 for both) and changes in bodily pain scores (−2.4±25, 0.5±21, and −17±25; P<0.05 
for both) were observed, with results favoring the surgical groups at 5 years from 
randomization (Fig. S6 and Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). Among patients in 
the medical-therapy group, none of the quality-of-life components improved significantly 
from baseline, and bodily pain and emotional well-being significantly worsened. Patients in 
both surgical groups had significant improvements in the physical functioning, general 
health, and energy–fatigue components of the RAND-36, although emotional well-being 
worsened significantly among patients in the gastric-bypass group.
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse events reported through year 5 are shown in Table 2. Subsequent surgical 
interventions were required in four patients in the surgical groups during year 1.8 One late 
reoperation, a successful laparoscopic conversion of sleeve gastrectomy to gastric bypass 
owing to recurrent gastric fistula, occurred in year 4. One patient in the medical-therapy 
group had a fatal myocardial infarction and one patient in the sleeve-gastrectomy group had 
a stroke. Excessive weight gain was observed in 19% of the patients in the medical-therapy 
group and in no patients in either surgical group (P<0.001). Mild anemia (mean hemoglobin 
level, 11.9±1.5 g per deciliter) was more common in the two surgical groups than in the 
medical-therapy group (P<0.009).
DISCUSSION
The results of this 5-year follow-up analysis from the STAMPEDE trial showed that 
bariatric surgery was superior to intensive medical therapy in terms of glycemic control, 
weight reduction, medication reduction, improvement in lipid levels, and quality of life. 
Patients who underwent gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy were significantly more likely 
to achieve and maintain a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.0% or less, with or without 
medications, than were those who received intensive medical therapy alone (29% and 23%, 
respectively, vs. 5%; P<0.03 for both comparisons). In an analysis that included adjustment 
for multiple comparisons and in an intention-to-treat analysis (neither analysis was 
prespecified), the P values for gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy as compared with 
medical therapy alone remained directionally consistent with, and qualitatively similar to, 
the analyses that were prespecified in the protocol. The surgically treated patients had 
superior glycemic control throughout the 5-year period while also using fewer diabetes 
medications, including insulin. More than 88% of the surgical patients had glycemic control 
that was considered to be very good to acceptable (average glycated hemoglobin level of 
7.0%), without the use of insulin. A majority of the surgical patients who achieved a 
glycated hemoglobin level of 6.0% or less reached that target without the use of diabetes 
medications, whereas none of the patients in the medical-therapy group reached that target 
without the use of diabetes medications. Surgical patients had a decrease of 2.1 percentage

 points in glycated hemoglobin levels at 5 years, as compared with a reduction of only 0.3 
percentage points among the patients who received medical therapy alone. The results of 
surgery are striking in this population with long-standing, uncontrolled diabetes. A duration 
of diabetes of less than 8 years was the main predictor of achieving a glycated hemoglobin 
level of 6.0% or less; this finding, which was also seen in other studies,2–7,11,12,16 
underscores the importance of early surgical intervention for maximal glycemic benefit. 
Weight loss by year 1 correlated with success in achieving the primary end point, but relapse 
of poor glycemic control was not associated with weight regain.
Analyses of the secondary end points, including BMI, body weight, waist circumference, 
levels of triglycerides and HDL cholesterol, and quality of life also showed results at 5 years 
that were more favorable in the surgical groups than in the medical-therapy group. A 
decrease from baseline in the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio was noted after sleeve 
gastrectomy but not after gastric bypass or after medical therapy alone. No significant 
differences from baseline in either the rates of albuminuria or retinopathy scores were 
observed after 5 years. The patients in the two surgical groups had a significant reduction in 
the use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering agents. One late reoperation for fistula after 
sleeve gastrectomy occurred, and some adverse effects of surgical treatment were observed 
but were not debilitating and, with the exception of mild anemia, were relatively uncommon 
after the first year.
Until recently, most studies that evaluated the effect of bariatric surgery on glycemic control 
in patients with type 2 diabetes were observational, included only severely obese patients, 
and showed high rates of remission after surgery.1–6 The initial and 3-year analyses from the 
current trial8,10 showed that up to 3 years after randomization, patients who underwent 
bariatric surgery had better glycemic control than patients who received medical therapy 
alone, a finding consistent with that in other trials.7,12–17,19 In a 5-year randomized, 
controlled trial (involving 60 patients) that compared medical therapy (therapeutic goal of a 
glycated hemoglobin level of <7.0%) with gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversion in 
severely obese patients (mean BMI, 44), Mingrone et al. found that 50% of surgical patients, 
as compared with none of the medically treated patients, maintained long-term diabetes 
remission (defined as a glycated hemoglobin level of <6.5% without diabetes medications) 
(P<0.001).11 Biliopancreatic diversion was associated with a higher rate of diabetes 
remission but also a higher rate of serious nutritional deficiencies than gastric bypass. 
Similarly, our current findings showed continued durability of glycemic improvement after 
gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, persistent weight loss, and reductions in diabetes and 
cardiovascular medications at 5 years, with the gap in glycemic control between medical and 
surgical therapy appearing to widen over time (Fig. 1A). In contrast to the trial reported by 
Mingrone et al., our trial involving 150 patients with mild obesity (BMI, 27 to 34) assessed 
more intensive medical therapy and a more aggressive primary end point (glycated 
hemoglobin level of ≤6.0% with or without medications), and it included sleeve gastrectomy 
(the most common metabolic operation). Other randomized, controlled trials showed 
metabolic improvements after gastric bypass that were similar to those of our trial11–15,17,19 
but showed less consistent improvements after gastric banding than did our trial.7,15,16,18

 gastrectomy, and gastric banding in randomized, controlled trials than the rates observed 
after biliopancreatic diversion.7–19
Data on changes in retinopathy scores and visual acuity from other randomized trials 
involving bariatric surgery are lacking. In our trial, no significant changes were observed at 
2 years after randomization22 or in the current 5-year analysis (Table S6 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). In contrast, initial worsening of retinopathy was shown in the 
Diabetes Control and Complications Trial within the first year of intensive medical 
treatment.23 Our results should mitigate concerns that rapid glycemic improvement with 
surgery could worsen retinopathy.
Using a validated quality-of-life instrument, we found significant and durable decreases in 
bodily pain and improvements in general health in the surgical groups as compared with the 
medical-therapy group at 5 years. Despite some improvement in glycemic control and 
weight loss, intensive medical therapy resulted in no significant improvements from baseline 
in quality-of-life components, and bodily pain and emotional well-being actually worsened. 
Similarly, Mingrone et al. found that at 5 years, quality of life was superior among patients 
who had undergone bariatric surgery than among those who received medical therapy.11
Some advantages of gastric bypass over sleeve gastrectomy have emerged. At 5 years, 
gastric bypass was associated with greater weight loss than sleeve gastrectomy, with fewer 
diabetes medications. Our trial was not powered sufficiently to detect small but clinically 
significant differences between the two procedures. Further clarification will require larger 
trials with longer follow-up.
Our 3-year analysis10 and other short-term randomized, controlled trials7,12–17,19 showed 
that surgical patients who had a BMI of 27 to 34 (36% of the patients in our trial) and 
diabetes had improvement in glycemic control that was similar to that of surgical patients 
who had a BMI of 35 or more and that was superior to that of patients who received medical 
therapy alone. Nearly all financial coverage policies for bariatric surgery worldwide (public 
and private) exclude patients with a BMI of less than 35. Our 5-year follow-up analysis 
shows that improvement in glycemic control after bariatric surgery among patients with a 
BMI of 27 to 34 was durable and was superior to that with intensive medical therapy (Fig. 
1D).
Limitations of our study include an inadequate sample size and duration to detect differences 
in the incidence of cardiovascular and end-organ complications and to detect some 
differences in outcomes between the two surgical procedures. Despite the intent to continue 
intensive medical treatment in the control group throughout the study, a reduction in diabetes 
medication use was observed after 3 years. Plausible explanations for nonadherence to 
medication use and lifestyle counseling include economic deterrents, unacceptable side 
effects from the drugs, and behavioral maladaptation. A higher degree of adherence may 
have decreased the efficacy gap between medical therapy and surgery.24
The current 5-year follow-up of patients in our trial showed that the beneficial effects of 
bariatric surgery on glycemic control were durable, even among patients with mild obesity 
(BMI of 27 to 34), which led to a sustained reduction in the use of diabetes and

 cardiovascular medications. Changes in body weight, lipid levels, and quality of life after 
surgery were superior to the changes observed after medical therapy alone. The potential 
benefits of bariatric surgery on clinical end points, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, 
renal failure, blindness, and death, as suggested in nonrandomized trials, can be adequately 
assessed only through larger, multicenter trials.

 Figure 1. Mean Changes in Measures of Diabetes Control from Baseline to 5 Years
Shown are the mean glycated hemoglobin levels (Panel A), the percent change in diabetes 
medications during the study period (Panel B), the changes in body-mass index (BMI, the 
weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) (Panel C), and the mean 
glycated hemoglobin levels according to BMI (Panel D) over a 5-year period among patients 
receiving intensive medical therapy alone, those who underwent sleeve gastrectomy, and 
those who underwent a gastric bypass procedure. ⌶ bars indicate standard errors. Mean 
values in each group are provided below the graphs; in Panels A and D, median values are 
also provided in parentheses. P values for the comparison between each surgical group and 
the medical-therapy group in Panels A, C, and D were derived from overall treatment effect 
in the repeated measurements model. In Panel D, P<0.001 for the comparison between the 
surgical groups and the medical-therapy group for the subgroup of patients with a BMI of 
less than 35; P<0.01 for the comparison for the subgroup with a BMI of 35 or more.

*Plus–minus values are means ±SD. To convert the values for glucose to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.05551. To convert the values for cholesterol to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.02586. To 
convert the values for triglycerides to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.01129. HDL denotes high-density lipoprotein, IQR interquartile range, and LDL low-density lipoprotein.
†P values for the primary end point in the analysis of patients who completed the trial are shown as unadjusted and as adjusted for multiple comparisons with the use of the Bonferroni step-down procedure. 
All P values for the secondary end points were adjusted for multiple comparisons.
‡One patient in the medical-therapy group crossed over to the gastric-bypass group during year 3 owing to the failure of the patient’s medical therapy and is counted in the denominator of the medical-
therapy group.
§The imputed intention-to-treat population comprised all 150 patients who underwent randomization (50 per group).
¶Values were compared with the use of Fisher’s exact test.
||Because of the variability and skewness of the data, the change from baseline or the percent change from baseline is not the numerical difference between the group-level value at baseline and the value at 5 
years.

*Not included in the safety analysis were seven patients in the medical-therapy group who withdrew immediately after randomization and one 
patient in the sleeve-gastrectomy group who had anemia before withdrawing from the trial before surgery. Other patients who started the trial but 
later withdrew or were lost to follow-up and patients who died were included in this analysis until their discontinuation or death.
†Nephropathy was defined according to any one of the following criteria: doubling of the serum creatinine level or a decrease in the glomerular 
filtration rate of more than 20%; development of macroalbuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, >300 [as measured in milligrams of albumin 
to grams of creatinine]); or renal transplantation, initiation of dialysis, or an increase in the serum creatinine level of more than 3.3 mg per deciliter 
(290 μmol per liter) in the absence of an acute reversible cause.
‡P<0.05 for the comparison between the medical-therapy group and the surgical group.
§Excessive weight gain was defined as a 5% increase in body weight over baseline.
¶Excessive weight loss was defined as attaining a body-mass index of less than 19 at 5 years.
