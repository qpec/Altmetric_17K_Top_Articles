SUMMARY
Background
Accumulating evidence suggests smoking may adversely affect cancer patients’ out-
comes. Previous studies of smoking and survival in colon cancer have been limited
by size and/or lack of a population basis and results have been inconsistent.
Aim
To investigate in a large population-based cohort whether smoking status at
diagnosis is an independent prognostic factor for cancer-specific survival in
colon cancer and whether treatment modifies any impact of smoking.
Methods
Colon adenocarcinomas diagnosed between 1994 and 2012 were abstracted
from the National Cancer Registry Ireland, and classified by smoking status at
diagnosis. Cancer-specific death rates over 5 years were compared in current,
ex- and never smokers using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models,
and subgroup analyses by treatment (combinations of cancer-directed surgery
and chemotherapy) were conducted.
Results
Of 18 166 colon cancers, 20% of patients were current smokers, 23% ex-smo-
kers and 57% never smokers. Compared to never smokers, current smokers
had a significantly raised cancer death rate [multivariable hazard ratio
(HR) = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.07–1.12]. There was a significant interaction between
treatment and smoking (P = 0.03). In those who had cancer-directed surgery
only, but not other groups, current smokers had a significantly increased can-
cer death rate compared to never smokers (HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09–1.34).
Conclusions
Smoking at diagnosis is an independent prognostic factor for colon cancer. The
limitation of the association to surgically-treated patients suggests that the
underlying mechanism(s) may be related to surgery. While further research is
needed to elucidate mechanisms, continued efforts to encourage smoking pre-
vention and cessation may yield benefits in terms of improved survival from
colon cancer.

 INTRODUCTION
Each year worldwide more than 750 000 new cases of col-
orectal cancer are diagnosed,1 around two-thirds of which
arise in the colon. There is compelling evidence for the
role of a range of lifestyle factors – including smoking,
physical activity and sedentary behaviour, weight and
weight change, and diet – in the aetiology of colon cancer
in particular.2–6 Evidence is also starting to suggest that
lifestyle factors may be associated with survival in patients
with colon cancer (see, for example,7–9). Given that many
lifestyle factors are potentially modifiable, greater clarity
on the role of these in colon cancer outcomes would be of
considerable public health importance.
A 2014 report by the US Surgeon General concluded
that smoking may be causally related to higher all-cause
and cancer-specific mortality and increased risk of sec-
ond primary cancers.10 A recent systematic review and
meta-analysis of six studies of smoking and colorectal
cancer survival estimated that, compared to never smok-
ers, current smokers had significantly increased risk of
death [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.15–1.37],11
but the result was based on all-cause mortality which is
influenced by the effects of smoking of deaths from dis-
eases other than cancer.12 Moreover, no distinction was
made between cancers of the colon and rectum. Four
studies included in the systematic review reported on
smoking and survival in colon cancer patients.13–16 All
described higher risk of death, or shorter survival, among
smokers (who were defined in various ways), but results
only reached statistical significance in two of the studies.
The majority of colon cancer patients undergo surgery
and suitable patients with stage II or III disease may
receive adjuvant chemotherapy.17 Studies suggest that
short-term post-operative morbidity and 30-day mortal-
ity
are
worse
in
colorectal
cancer
patients
who
smoke.18, 19 One small study of 284 colorectal cancer
patients with pathologically complete resection reported
a significant raised hazard ratio in active smokers20 but
no studies appear to have investigated whether smoking
is also associated with survival in non-surgical colon
cancer
patients.
Nicotine

ciations between smoking and chemotherapy receipt in
colon cancer patients have not been examined.
This large population-based cohort study aimed to
investigate (i) whether smoking status at diagnosis is an
independent prognostic factor for cancer-specific survival
in colon cancer and (ii) whether the association varies
by whether or not patients undergo cancer-directed sur-
gery or receive chemotherapy.
METHODS
Setting
The study was conducted in Ireland, which has a mixed
public–private healthcare system. All residents are enti-
tled to care within the public system. A population-based
colorectal cancer screening programme commenced roll-
out in 2013. Prior to that, screening was not generally
available.
Data
The data source was the National Cancer Registry Ire-
land, which aims to record all cancers newly diagnosed
in the population usually resident in Ireland, using an
active registration process. Completeness of registration
is estimated to be at least 97%.22 Following standard pro-
tocols, trained tumour registration officers collect patient
(e.g. date of birth, address at diagnosis), tumour (e.g.
cancer site, date of diagnosis) and first course treatment
(surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy within a year of
diagnosis) details for each tumour. The information col-
lected includes patients’ smoking status at diagnosis, as
recorded in their hospital records. The Central Statistics
Office notifies deaths to the Registry, where they are
linked to registered cancers, using probabilistic matching
methods; this allows dates and causes of death to be
identified.
For this analysis, all cases of colon cancer diagnosed
1994–2012 (ICD10 C18, n = 24 953) were abstracted
from the Registry. Cases were excluded if they had
another invasive cancer (other than non-melanoma skin
cancer) diagnosed prior to, or following, the colon can-
cer (n = 3889), had a tumour morphology other than
adenocarcinoma (n = 2842) or were identified from
death certificates only (n = 56). Ascertainment of deaths
was complete to 31 December 2012. Colon cancer-speci-
fic deaths were defined as those for which the underlying
cause of death was coded as: cancer at the same diagno-
sis site; cancer of the same body system; cancer of
another specified site or cancer of unknown site.23
In terms of treatment, each case was classified accord-
ing to whether or not the patient received, within a year
of diagnosis: (i) cancer–directed surgery (i.e. colectomy,
hemicolectomy limited excision with or without anasto-
mosis, or endoscopic local excision/destruction) and (ii)
at least one course of chemotherapy. Age, marital status
and sex were available from Registry records. Cases were
assigned to one of five deprivation categories based on
address of residence at the time of diagnosis. Categories
ranged from least (1) to most deprived (5) and were

Smoking and colon cancer survival
 based on a score derived from 2002 census variables24;
the 2002 census was used as this was closest to the mid-
dle of the study period. In terms of clinical variables,
summary stage at diagnosis was defined according to the
UICC classification25 and grade as well differentiated,
moderately differentiated or poorly differentiated/undif-
ferentiated. Cases were categorised as being located in
the proximal (ICD10 18.0–18.5) or distal colon (18.6–
18.8) or colon not otherwise specified (NOS; 18.9).
Smoking status at diagnosis was classified as: never
smoked; ex-smoker (had smoked at least once every
month in the past but not in the previous year); and
current smoker (had smoked at least once every month
in the previous year). For 26% of patients, smoking sta-
tus at diagnosis was unknown. Information was incom-
plete or missing for tumour stage (4%) and grade (12%),
which are important prognostic factors.26, 27 In total,
36% of patients had missing values for one or more of
smoking status, stage and grade. The missing data items
in these field were populated by multiple imputation by
chained equations based on other available data.28, 29
Multiple imputation is considered superior to other
approaches to dealing with missing data, because it pro-
duces less biased estimates than complete case analysis
under a range of missing data scenarios and, under other
scenarios, is more efficient than complete case analy-
sis.30–32 Fifty datasets were generated, in which missing
values for smoking status, grade and stage were imputed
using
multinomial
logistic
regression
including,
as
covariates, socio-demographic and clinical variables, indi-
cators of cancer-specific death and death from any cause,
and time to cancer death (or censor date) and any death
(or censor date) (Table S1).
Statistical analysis
The primary analysis was based on the dataset contain-
ing the imputed data. As recommended, a complete case
analysis (considered a sensitivity analysis) was conducted
for
comparison.33
Our
interest
was
in
associations
between smoking and rate of death so cancer-specific
survival was the primary outcome and noncancer deaths
were censored (as opposed to being considered compet-
ing risks). For each patient, survival time was computed
from the date of diagnosis to date of death, 5 years of
follow-up, or the censoring date (31 December 2012),
whichever occurred first. Chi-square tests were used to
compare patient-related and clinical characteristics of
never, ex- and current smokers at the time of diagnosis.
Curves of cumulative incidence of cancer-specific death
up to 5-years post-diagnosis were generated by smoking
status and – to aid interpretation – similar curves for
cumulative incidence of deaths due to other causes.
Unadjusted and multivariable hazard ratios for cancer-
specific death within 5-years by smoking status were
computed using Cox proportional hazards regression.
Hazard ratio estimates from the 50 imputed datasets
were combined to provide a single estimate with the
standard error adjusted for inter- and intra-imputation
variance according to Rubin’s rules.34 Variables for inclu-
sion in the multivariable model were selected using a
backwards stepwise approach; variables were retained if
the Wald test P-value was <0.05. For each covariate, a
test for proportionality of hazards was performed35 and,
since the hazards for age and stage were nonpropor-
tional, these variables were fitted as strata in the model.
Initially, the analysis was done for all cases then repeated
for subgroups defined by treatment. Since most treatments
are received shortly after diagnosis, four subgroups were
created by combining variables for receipt of cancer-direc-
ted surgery (yes/no) and receipt of chemotherapy (yes/no).
The interaction between smoking and treatment was tested
by fitting a cross-product term. Those who die soon after
diagnosis have no possibility of undergoing treatment and
this complicates comparisons of treated and untreated
groups; how this might influence the relationship between
smoking and survival is unclear. Therefore, we repeated
this analysis using a landmark approach,36 which involved
restricting the analysis to patients who were alive at
6 months post-diagnosis (since almost all treatments had
been delivered by 6 months; n = 14 387).
In the sensitivity analysis, we analysed the dataset which
included all patients without missing data for smoking sta-
tus, stage or grade (‘complete cases’, n = 11 648). We
repeated the descriptive analyses and re-ran the final mul-
tivariable model to estimate hazard ratios by smoking sta-
tus. All analyses were done in STATA 11.0 (College Station,
Texas, USA).
Review of previous studies
To set our findings in context, we searched Medline for
other studies reporting some aspect of survival by smok-
ing status in people with colon cancer. MeSH headings
and text word searches were undertaken, combining
terms for disease, smoking exposure and outcome. To be
eligible studies had to be published as full papers, in the
English language, by 30th November 2016. Information
on the study population, sample size, assessment of
smoking status, smoking prevalence and hazard ratios
for survival by smoking status was abstracted from the
papers identified.

 RESULTS
Primary analyses: multiple imputed dataset
The analysis included 18 166 incident colon cancers.
After imputation, 57% of patients were classified as never
smokers at diagnosis, 23% as ex-smokers and 20% as
current smokers (Table 1). Slightly more than half of
patients were male, 13% were aged under 55 at diagnosis
and 35% were aged 75 or older. Cancer-directed surgery
was received by 85% and 38% had chemotherapy. In
terms of treatment combinations, 53% had cancer-direc-
ted surgery only, 33% had surgery and chemotherapy,
5% had chemotherapy only, and 10% had neither treat-
ment.
There were significant associations between smoking
status and all of the socio-demographic and clinical vari-
ables
(chi-square
P < 0.01
throughout;
Table 1).
A
higher proportion of current smokers was diagnosed
under 55, than ex-smokers or never smokers. The pro-
portion of current smokers who lived in the most
deprived areas was higher than for ex- and never smok-
ers. Twenty-seven per cent of current smokers had stage
IV disease at diagnosis compared to 24% each of ex-
smokers and never smokers. The percentage of current
smokers who had cancer-directed surgery was slightly
lower (82%) than among ex- (85%) and never smokers
(86%). In contrast, chemotherapy receipt was more com-
mon among current smokers (41%) than ex- or never
smokers (both 37%).
During the 5-years post-diagnosis, there were 7488
cancer specific deaths. The cumulative incidence of can-
cer-specific death was highest in the current smokers;
the curves for ex-smokers and never smokers were
almost identical (Figure S1a). For noncancer deaths, the
cumulative incidence was consistently higher in current
and ex-smokers than in never smokers (Figure S1b).
Univariate and multivariable hazard ratios for cancer-
specific death by smoking status for all patients are
shown in Table 2. In the univariate analysis, smoking
was a significant prognostic factor; compared to never
smokers, current smokers had a significantly increased
rate of cancer death, while ex-smokers did not. This pat-
tern persisted after adjustment for socio-demographic
and clinical variables (sex, marital status, deprivation cat-
egory, period of diagnosis, grade and tumour location).
Compared to never smokers, the hazard ratio for current
smokers was raised by 14% and this was statistically sig-
nificant (multivariable HR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.07–1.22).
The hazard in ex-smokers did not differ from unity
(HR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.94–1.17).
Table 3 shows the univariate and multivariable hazard
ratios for smoking status in the four treatment groups.
There was a significant interaction between smoking and
treatment (P = 0.034). A significant association between
smoking and cancer-specific death was apparent among
patients who had surgery only (P < 0.01); in adjusted
analysis, comparing to never smokers, current smokers
had a 21% higher rate of cancer death (HR = 1.21, 95%
CI: 1.09–1.34) while the rate in ex-smokers was not
raised. In the other three treatment groups, current
smoking was not associated with a higher cancer death
rate.
In the landmark analysis, the same pattern was evi-
dent although the test for interaction was no longer sta-
tistically significant (P = 0.118). In the surgery only
group, current smokers had a significantly higher rate of
death (HR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.09–1.34; P < 0.01); the esti-
mates for current vs. never smokers in the other treat-
ment groups did not differ from unity (surgery &
chemotherapy: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.97–1.22; chemotherapy
only: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.82–1.25; neither surgery nor
chemotherapy: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.84–1.17).
Sensitivity analyses: complete case dataset
Table S2 summarises the characteristics of the 11 648
patients in the complete case analysis. The same pattern
of association between smoking status and cumulative
incidence of cancer-specific death was evident in this
analysis as in the primary analysis based on the dataset
with imputed values (data not shown). In univariate
analyses, current smokers had a 21% higher rate of can-
cer-specific death than never smokers; this attenuated
slightly in the multivariable analysis but remained statis-
tically significant (multivariable HR = 1.17, 95% CI:
1.08–1.26) (Table S3). The hazard ratio for ex-smokers
was 0.99 in both univariate and multivariable analysis.
There was a significant interaction between treatment
and smoking (P < 0.01) and, as in the primary analysis,
the association between current smoking and cancer
specific death was found only among cases who had sur-
gery without chemotherapy (multivariable HR = 1.28,
95% CI 1.14–1.43) (Table S4). The same pattern, and a
significant interaction (P < 0.01), was seen in the land-
mark analysis (data not shown).
Review of previous studies
Eight studies of smoking and survival in colon cancer
were identified, six from the USA, one from Canada and
one from Germany (Table 4).7, 13–16, 37–39 Sample sizes
ranged from 424 to 4213. Studies varied in how, and at

Smoking and colon cancer survival
 hazard for current vs. never- or non-smokers, but this
only reached statistical significance in four studies.
DISCUSSION
In this population-based cohort study – which is, by far,
the largest study of smoking at diagnosis and survival in
colon cancer – current smokers (but not ex-smokers)
had a statistically significant, 14% higher, rate of cancer
death compared to never smokers.
Although all of the eight previous studies of colon can-
cer patients reported poorer survival (by at least by one
survival measure) in smokers than non- or never smok-
ers,7, 13–16, 37–39 the association was not statistically sig-
nificant in four studies and, in one further study, there
was a significant reduction in disease-free survival but
not in cancer-specific survival. In part, this is likely to be
due to the relatively modest sample size and hence lim-
ited statistical power of most of the studies. In the studies
which reported significant findings, the hazard ratio for
current smokers was around 1.5.7, 15, 16, 39 One reason
for the more modest association in the current study than
these studies may that our data was from a population-
based cancer registry; the analysis therefore included all
(or, at least 97% of)22 colon adenocarcinomas diagnosed
in Ireland during 1994–2012 eliminating any possibility
of selection or participation biases. Of the previous stud-
ies, none was truly population-based; three of the eight
studies sampled potential participants (who could then
agree or decline
to
participate)
from
a
population-based
sampling
frame13, 15, 37 and, of these, only one reported a signifi-
cantly increased hazard for smokers.15 Another possible
explanation for the more modest association in our study
is that we adjusted for deprivation. Deprivation is a mar-
ker of socio-economic status and past studies have
reported positive associations between various markers of
socio-economic status and colon cancer survival.40–42
Smoking prevalence tends to be higher in people of lower
socio-economic status and/or in more deprived areas,43
and this is also seen in Ireland.44 Thus, adjustment for
deprivation would be likely to attenuate observed associa-
tions between smoking and survival.
The observed interaction between smoking and treat-
ment, such that the adverse effect of current smoking
was limited to patients who had cancer-directed surgery
only, is noteworthy. Several studies have convincingly

 shown more post-operative complications and higher
post-operative mortality in colon (or colorectal) cancer
patients who smoke.18, 19 However, these studies mainly
considered short-term outcomes (e.g. 30-day mortality).
This study therefore adds to the evidence-base by show-
ing that smoking adversely affects 5-year survival in sur-
gically treated patients. Moreover, the landmark analysis,
which included patients who had survived 6 months,
suggests that the adverse effect of smoking is not limited
to the period immediately post-surgery but extends long
term. In addition, our results confirm – in a much larger
series and at the population-level – the findings of
Munro et al.20 who reported that active smokers (but
not ex-smokers) had a significantly increased hazard
compared to nonsmokers; and extend these to show that
there is no adverse effect of smoking in nonsurgical
patients. The consistent results in the landmark analysis
indicate our results are not due to immortal time bias.45
Our findings, and those of Munro et al.,20 suggest that
the mechanism(s) by which smoking impacts on colon
cancer survival are related, in some way, to surgery.
The lack of association between smoking and survival
in surgical patients who also had chemotherapy is intrigu-
ing. It seems likely that those who receive chemotherapy
are fitter, suggesting that the effect of smoking may be
stronger (or only evident) in less fit patients. This might
usefully be investigated in future studies.
A significant proportion of colon cancers presents as
emergencies requiring rapid surgical intervention.46, 47 A
Swedish study found that colon cancer patients with a
lower level of education, or lower income, were more
likely to present as emergencies48 and, in analyses of a
subgroup of colon cancers in Ireland, 31% of current
smokers presented as emergencies compared to 24% of
ex-smokers and never smokers combined. Since cases
which present as emergencies have higher mortality,46, 49
this suggests that a higher frequency of emergency pre-
sentation
among
smokers
could
help
explain
the
observed association. Positive margins are a risk factor
for recurrence following resection for colon cancer17 and
a single study has reported a slightly higher rate of radial
margin positivity among current smokers (6.4%) than
other colon cancer patients (5.1%).50 However, the over-
all rate of radial margin positivity appears too low to
fully explain the survival differential between current and
never smokers. Another possible explanation follows
from the observations that smoking induces a systemic
inflammatory response51 and that systemic inflammatory
response is a prognostic factor following colorectal resec-
tion.52 Finally, smoking may be a marker for raised
levels of the complex glycoprotein carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA), which is a strong prognostic factor in
colorectal cancer.53 Studies among apparently healthy
volunteers have found associations between smoking and
higher CEA levels.54, 55 Further investigations of these
potential mechanisms would be of considerable value.
Like a few previous studies,38, 56 we found that cur-
rent smokers were more often diagnosed with more
advanced disease. While this might point to a tumour
promoting effect of smoking, it may also be due to dif-
ferent patterns of healthcare consultation in smokers and
nonsmokers. Further research to better understand this
relationship might illuminate the mechanisms by which
smoking influences cancer progression.
Strengths and limitations
Although our data were population-based, the fact that
they were derived from a cancer registry meant that we
did not have information on disease-free survival, nor
did we have any information on tobacco exposure other
than smoking status at diagnosis. We also lacked infor-
mation on other lifestyle factors some of which have
been related to colon cancer survival and may be associ-
ated with smoking. Smoking status was derived from
medical records and, as such, may be subject to misclas-
sification. Data suggest that in face-to-face interviews for
research studies, few people in the general population
misrepresent
their
use
of
tobacco
products,57
but
whether this holds for cancer patients in discussions with
health professionals who are involved in their treatment
is less certain. It seems most likely that – due to social
desirability bias – any misclassification will be differen-
tial, such that current smokers are more likely to have
been classified as nonsmokers than vice versa; this would
mean that the hazard ratios are biased towards the null
and we have underestimated the true association between
smoking and survival. We chose to base our analysis on
cancer-specific
survival
rather
than
overall
survival
because the latter is likely influenced by the impact of
smoking on other major causes of death, notably cardio-
vascular disease. Cancer-specific survival analyses are
reliant on accurate information on cause of death. While
it is well recognised that the cause of death recorded on
some death certificates is inaccurate,58 there does not
appear to be any published data to suggest that (in)accu-
racy is differential by smoking status. In addition, the
SEER classification of cancer-specific deaths includes
cancers at sites outside the body system of interest23
and, in our study, there were some deaths at sites other
than the bowel, but numbers were small (~2% of deaths).

Smoking and colon cancer survival
 Almost half were coded to the lung or liver so probably
represent metastases from the primary tumour; others
may represent cancers diagnosed before 1994, about
which we had no information. Moreover, the rate of
noncancer deaths was higher among current smokers
and ex-smokers than never smokers in our dataset, pro-
viding some reassurance about the accuracy of death cer-
tificates and suggesting that the poorer survival observed
in smokers is unlikely to be due to noncancer deaths
being miscoded as cancer deaths.
Implications
Although not specific to colon cancer, evidence suggests
that some cancer patients give up smoking around the time
of diagnosis and others want to stop,59, 60 and that smok-
ing cessation interventions can be successful among
patients/survivors.61, 62 A single trial of a smoking cessa-
tion intervention in patients undergoing colorectal resec-
tion found no difference in post-operative complication
rates between arms,63 but the sample size was small
(n = 60). Further studies are needed to investigate whether
smoking cessation around the time of diagnosis improves
patients’ outcomes, either in the short or longer-term.
CONCLUSIONS
In this large, population-based, cohort study of newly
diagnosed colon cancer patients, current smokers (but not
ex-smokers) had a significantly increased rate of cancer
death compared to never smokers. This effect was limited
to those patients who had cancer-directed surgery, sug-
gesting that the mechanism by which smoking impacts on
survival is in some way related to surgery. Further
research is needed to better elucidate these mechanisms
but, meanwhile, continued efforts to encourage smoking
prevention and cessation may bring benefits in terms of
improved survival from colon cancer.
