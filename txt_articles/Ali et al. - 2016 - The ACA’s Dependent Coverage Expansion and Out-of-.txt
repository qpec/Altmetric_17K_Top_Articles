Behavioral Health Conditions

Objective: Young adults with behavioral health conditions
(mental or substance use disorders) often lack access to
care. In 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extended eli-
gibility for dependent coverage under private health in-
surance, allowing young adults to continue on family plans
until age 26. The objective of this study was to analyze out-
of-pocket (OOP) spending as a share of total health care
expenditures for young adults with behavioral health con-
ditions before and after the implementation of the ACA
dependent care provision. The study examined the pop-
ulation of young adults with behavioral health conditions
overall and by race and ethnicity.
Methods: The study analyzed 2008–2009 and 2011–2012
nationally representative data from the Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey with zero-or-one inflated beta regression
models in a difference-in-differences framework to estimate
the impact of the ACA’s dependent coverage expansion.
OOP spending was examined as a share of total health care
expenditures among young adults with behavioral health
disorders. The study compared the treatment group of in-
dividuals ages 19–25 (unweighted N=1,158) with a group
ages 27–29 (unweighted N=668).
Results: Young adults ages 19–25 with behavioral health
disorders were significantly less likely than the older group to
have high levels of OOP spending after the implementation
of the ACA’s dependent coverage expansion. The reduction
was pronounced among young adults from racial-ethnic
minority groups.
Conclusions: The extension of health insurance coverage to
young adults with behavioral health disorders has provided
them with additional financial protection, which can be im-
portant given the low incomes and high debt burden that
characterize the age group.

Before the implementation of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act (ACA), young adults in the United States
were estimated to have lower levels of insurance coverage
compared with other age groups. Almost 30% of young
adults between the ages of 19 and 30 lacked health insurance
coverage (1), and the transition from adolescence to young
adulthood was often associated with the loss of health in-
surance (2). Young adults without health insurance had
higher rates of not receiving needed care, were more likely
than other age groups to report that their health worsened as
a result of not getting necessary care, and had greater diffi-
culty paying medical bills than their same-age counterparts
with health insurance (3). Given the low rates of health in-
surance coverage among young adults, it is expected that the
ACA will have a substantial impact (4) by allowing young
adults to remain on their parents’ health insurance as de-
pendents. Although the full enactment of the ACA began in
2014, the dependent coverage provision went into effect in
September 2010.
Before the ACA’s enactment, dependent coverage fre-
quently ended by age 19 (5). Estimates show that the de-
pendent coverage provision has reduced the number of
uninsured young adults by at least three million (6). The
expansions in insurance coverage under the ACA are also
expected to result in an increase in the number of users of
mental health and substance abuse treatment services (7),
although noninsurance factors, such as perceived need for
treatment, also play a role in whether individuals seek be-
havioral health services (8). Expansions in insurance cov-
erage may be particularly important for young adults not
only because their insurance coverage rates were low but
also because behavioral health conditions (mental or sub-
stance use disorders) often emerge for the first time in this
age range (9–11). The literature also documents that indi-
viduals with a comorbid behavioral health disorder experi-
ence higher health care costs (12). For example, one study
found that monthly costs for a patient with a chronic disease
and depression are $560 more than for a person with a

ARTICLES
 chronic disease without depression (13). Individuals with
behavioral health disorders are more likely to have lower
socioeconomic status, be unemployed, and have lower edu-
cational attainment (14–17). Hence, the presence of behav-
ioral health disorders and lack of health coverage can be
related to higher total health care expenditures and out-of-
pocket (OOP) payments.
A number of studies have examined the impact of the
dependent care provision of the ACA, and the literature has
reported evidence of increased rates of insurance coverage
and higher health services utilization (18–22). Studies spe-
cifically examining behavioral health services have, however,
focused mostly on mental illness and have reported evidence
of an increase in overall mental health services utilization
(18) and hospital-based mental health care (20,22). Although
the literature shows an increase in private insurance pay-
ment for mental health services (19), no studies to date have
examined the impact of the ACA’s dependent coverage
provision on health care spending of young adults with be-
havioral health disorders. This is an important omission
from the literature in that one of the primary objectives of
the ACA is to protect individuals from large and unexpected
OOP health care expenses (21). Given the relatively low in-
comes of young adults compared with older adults, OOP
expenses can have serious consequences for young adults’
finances (19). Recent evidence from the Oregon Health In-
surance Experiment and the health reform in Massachusetts
has shown that newly insured individuals have benefited
from having fewer unpaid bills, less past-due debt, and im-
proved credit scores (23–25). As the full enactment of the ACA
continues, focus will increasingly shift to understanding im-
pacts on patients, including effects on their finances (26,27).
Assessing the impact of the ACA’s dependent care pro-
vision on the health care expenses of young adults by their
race and ethnicity, especially among those with behavioral
health disorders, is important from a policy perspective.
More than 50% of Latino and 33% of African-American
young adults ages 20–29 were uninsured in 2008–2009,
compared with 25% of non-Latino white young adults
(26,28). Lack of health insurance coverage across racial and
ethnic groups has been associated with uncertainty over
family health expenditures, large OOP expenses, and lower
health care access and utilization (22). The ACA expansion
of dependent coverage applies only to young adults whose
parents have either employer-sponsored health insurance
or health insurance purchased through the exchanges.
Compared with whites, African Americans and Latinos are
less likely to have employer-provided private coverage be-
cause of income, immigration status, or both (1). In fact, the
literature has documented that the ACA’s dependent
coverage expansion has resulted in an increase in private
insurance coverage for non-Latino whites by over 5 per-
centage points, whereas for Latinos and African Americans
the increase has been a little over 3 percentage points (29).
Although there has been some analysis, by race and
ethnicity, of the provision’s impact on clinical conditions,
such analyses have not been extended to the subpopulation
of young adults with behavioral health conditions.
Our study contributes to the literature on the ACA’s de-
pendent coverage mandate in two important ways. First,
using large nationally representative data, we examined the
mandate’s impact on OOP spending share of total health care
expenses (behavioral health and all other types of health
care expenses) of young adults with a behavioral health
disorder, which has not been done previously (16–18). Sec-
ond, this is the first study we are aware of that examined by
race and ethnicity the impact of the ACA’s expansion of
dependent coverage on health care spending among young
adults with behavioral health disorders. It is important to
understand the provision’s impact by race and ethnicity to
improve the equity and affordability of the behavioral health
care delivery system given that clinical needs and utilization
patterns can differ significantly by race and ethnicity (1).
METHODS
Data
We analyzed Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)
data from 2008–2009 and 2011–2012. MEPS is a nation-
ally representative survey of the U.S. civilian, noninsti-
tutionalized population. It provides information about
respondents’ medical expenditures during the survey year,
as well as their demographic characteristics, socioeconomic
characteristics, health status, and health insurance status.
The MEPS consolidated files were merged to the medical
condition files to obtain information on respondents’ di-
agnosed disorders, validated by the respondents’ physicians
through the medical provider component file. This file
contains data from providers who provided medical care to
the respondents and contains data on dates of visits, use of
medical care services, charges, sources of payments and
amounts, and diagnosis and procedure codes.
We applied the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality’s Clinical Classification Software to MEPS data to
identify young adults with any diagnosed behavioral health
disorder. [A list of the behavioral health disorders included
in this study is presented in the online supplement to this
article.] We parsed the young adult population into two
groups: the targeted group for expansion of ACA coverage
of dependents (ages 19–25, N=1,158, representing 24 million
young adults) and the comparison group (ages 27–29, N=618,
representing 9.4 million young adults). We used young
adults ages 27–29 years as the reference group to be con-
sistent with previous studies (19,22). Also, consistent with
prior literature, we used 2008–2009 and 2011–2012 as the
pre- and postimplementation periods to examine the trends
in health care expenditures resulting from the imple-
mentation of ACA (1,19).
Our primary outcome variable was total OOP payments
as a share of total health care spending (1). This expen-
diture measure was self-reported but was validated by
respondents’ physicians and pharmacists and adjusted to
978

 constant dollars with the 2012 Medical Care
Component of the Consumer Price Index. It
is important to note that the total health care
expenditure variable in MEPS is defined as
the sum of direct payments for care pro-
vided during the year, including OOP spend-
ing and payments by private insurance,
Medicaid, Medicare, and other sources. The
total expenditure variable sums all amounts
paid OOP and by third-party payers and is
verified by the MEPS medical component
file. Similarly, OOP measures are expenses
that have been paid for health care services
by the respondents, including copayments
and coinsurance.
We controlled for variables widely used
in the health care expenditure literature, in-
cluding race and ethnicity, gender, marital
status, self-reported general health and mental
health, education, family income, urbanicity,
and U.S. census region (28,30). We also con-
trolled for being interviewed for the MEPS
in English.
Analysis
As a result of the ACA, since September 23,
2010, young adults have been able to join
or to remain on their parents’ private health
insurance plan, regardless of whether the
young adults are married, attending school,
financially dependent on parents, or eligible
for employer-provided health insurance
coverage (4,6). We used a difference-in-
differences approach to capture the impact
of this insurance expansion natural experi-
ment. We identified changes in OOP share
of total health expenditures for young adults
ages 19–25 years (the target population) from
the ACA preimplementation (2008–2009) and post-
implementation (2011–2012) periods relative to changes in
the OOP share of total health care expenditures among young
adults ages 27–29 (the comparison group).
We used zero-or-one inflated beta (ZOIB) regression
models (31,32) and adopted different model specifications
to test the robustness of our findings. Specifically, in
model 1, the basic model, we controlled for age, race and
ethnicity, gender, marital status, interview language, family
income, education, whether the participant resided in an
urban area, and U.S. census region. In model 2, we added
self-reported general medical health and mental health to
the factors controlled for in model 1. ZOIB models were ap-
propriate in this study because the dependent variables used
were proportions (values range between 0 and 1, including
0 and 1). ZOIB models can estimate the probabilities of having
the value 0, 1, or both values as a separate process, which was
important for our purposes because individuals with OOP
equal to 0 or 1 could be different from individuals with OOP
between 0 and 1. For example, individuals with OOP equal
to 1 could remain uninsured or have high-deductible plans.
Furthermore, to examine whether the association between
the ACA dependent coverage and OOP share differed by
race and ethnicity, we assessed the interaction between the
post-ACA implementation period indicator (2011–2012)
with race and ethnicity by age group. All results were na-
tionally representative and generated by using the survey
weights provided by the MEPS. Stata 12 MP was used to
conduct the analysis.

ALI ET AL.
 dependent coverage expansion had a significant impact
on reducing the OOP share when it was 100% of the total
health care cost for the target group across all model
specifications. Specifically, in model 1, the interaction term
for adults ages 19–25 and years 2011–2012 was statistically
significant and negative (coefficient=21.07, p,.05) when
OOP share was equal to 1 (that is, OOP expense as a share
of total health care expenditure was 100%). This implies
that persons ages 19–25 with a behavioral health disorder
after the implementation of the dependent coverage man-
date were less likely than the comparison group to have
to pay 100% of their health care costs as an OOP expense
(exp[21.07]=.34 odds ratio). After respondents’ health status
was controlled for (model 2), the coefficient of this interac-
tion term was still negative and significant (coefficient=21.05,
p,.05). Although the ZOIB results did not indicate a re-
duction in OOP share at all levels, the reduction in OOP
share at the highest level implies that young adults ages
19–25 with behavioral health disorders were less likely than
others to bear a significant financial burden for their health
care expenses following the implementation of the ACA’s
dependent coverage expansion.
The results from the two model specifications consis-
tently showed a statistically significant impact of the ACA
on racial-ethnic minority populations. Specifically, Latinos,
African Americans, and young adults from other racial-
ethnic minority groups who had behavioral health disorders
and were ages 19–25 had lower odds of having a 100% OOP
share of total health care expenditures after the dependent
coverage mandate (Table 3). To check the robustness of our
estimates that young adults with behavioral health condi-
tions are less likely to have higher levels of OOP as a share
of health care expenditures after the dependent coverage
mandate, we estimated logit models where the dependent
variable was defined as having OOP share
$75% (Table 4). Consistent with the esti-
mates from the ZOIB models, the results in-
dicated decreased odds of having OOP of
$75% as a share of total health care expen-
ditures for young adults eligible to remain on
their parents’ health insurance policy after
the implementation of the ACA’s dependent
coverage expansion. Consistent with the
ZOIB estimates, these results were also sig-
nificant for young adults from racial-ethnic
minority groups, providing further evidence
of a reduction in financial burden that the
minority young adult population with a be-
havioral health disorder might have experi-
enced as a result of the ACA expansion. As a
further robustness check, we used linear re-
gressions to reestimate all of our models and
found results consistent with the ones pre-
sented here. These results are available from
the authors on request.
DISCUSSION
This study used a nationally representative data set to es-
timate the impact of the ACA’s dependent coverage ex-
pansion on OOP health care expenses for young adults
with behavioral health disorders. Our results show evi-
dence of a decline in high levels of OOP expenses between
2008–2009 and 2011–2012 as a share of total health care
expenses for the targeted age group (age 19–25) compared
with the group of individuals who are in a close age range
(age 27–29) but who were not specific beneficiaries of the
ACA’s dependent coverage provision. In addition, our
study shows that the impact of the ACA expansion on
health care expenditures differed by race and ethnicity
among individuals with behavioral health conditions.
Specifically, our findings indicate a significant reduction in
100% OOP share of health care expenditures among young
adult Latinos, African Americans, and young adults from
other racial and ethnic backgrounds who had a behavioral
health disorder. This is an important finding and shows
that the ACA has potentially reduced the financial burden
of health care in a demographic group with higher rates
of unemployment and lower salaries. Given that the un-
employment rate among the racial-ethnic minority groups
remained mostly unchanged (26,27) during 2008–2012,
this reduction in OOP share likely occurred as a result of
access to insurance. In other words, access to insurance
might have resulted in reduced medical expenses for those
seeking care.
Despite its strong quasi-experimental design, our study
had several limitations that are worth noting. First, we were
unable to conduct separate analysis for the populations with
mental and substance use disorders. The literature documents
utilization of services to be quite different for mental illness

 and substance abuse (7,9), and substance
abuse treatment benefits, in particular, have
been restricted in many private insurance
plans despite the 2008 Mental Health Parity
and Addiction Equity Act (33). It is unclear
whether the dependent coverage provision
had a differential impact on individuals with
mental disorders or substance use disorders.
Examining whether there was a differential
impact by type of condition could be an im-
portant avenue for future research.
Second, we were unable to analyze other
measures of financial protection beyond OOP
as a share of total health care expenditures.
Examining other measures of financial in-
security, such as unpaid bills and past-due
debt, could make an important contribution
to the literature. Third, our study did not
identify what types of behavioral health
expenditures changed and whether they
changed through reductions in payments
to providers or treatment types or quanti-
ties. More research is needed to understand
the significant categories of spending pre-
and post-ACA for each age cohort. Fourth,
prior to the implementation of the ACA’s
dependent coverage expansion, 37 states
had laws that expanded dependent cov-
erage for young adults. The laws differed
in their age cutoffs, the young adult populations covered
(for example, full-time students and unmarried indi-
viduals), and the types of policies covered (2). The
existence of these dependent coverage laws in the pre-
period of our analysis imparts a conservative bias to our
findings.
CONCLUSIONS
Our findings contribute to the emerging literature on the
impact of ACA’s dependent coverage provision among
young adults, where the consensus is that access to health
insurance has increased utilization and lowered costs for
health services (4,6). Our findings are consistent with this,
in that we found that young adults with behavioral health
disorders generally were less likely to have high levels of
OOP costs as a share of their total health care spending
after the ACA expansion of dependent coverage. This re-
sult is also consistent with the literature examining the
Oregon Health Insurance Experiment and Massachusetts
health reform, which has shown evidence of more financial
security among the newly insured (24,25). The extension
of health insurance coverage to young adults with behav-
ioral health disorders provided them with additional fi-
nancial protection, especially given the low incomes and
high debt burden in this age group. As the ACA’s coverage
expansion continues through the implementation of the
legislation’s other provisions, further reductions in OOP
spending by young adults with behavioral health condi-
tions may occur.

year 2011–2012 indicator and the treatment groups (adults ages 19–25) by race and ethnicity
are presented. Analyses controlled for all the other covariates. Results are available on request.
Model 1 accounted for age, gender, marital status, education, family income, being interviewed
in English, living in an urban area, and U.S. census region; model 2 accounted for those variables
plus health. Statistics are nationally representative (representing N=3.7 million young adults ages
19–25 and N=1.9 million young adults ages 27–29 with behavioral health disorders).
