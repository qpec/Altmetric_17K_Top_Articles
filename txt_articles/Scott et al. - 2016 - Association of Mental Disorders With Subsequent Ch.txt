Abstract
IMPORTANCE—It is clear that mental disorders in treatment settings are associated with a 
higher incidence of chronic physical conditions, but whether this is true of mental disorders in the 
community, and how generalized (across a range of physical health outcomes) these associations 
are, is less clear. This information has important implications for mental health care and the 
primary prevention of chronic physical disease.
OBJECTIVE—To investigate associations of 16 temporally prior DSM-IV mental disorders with 
the subsequent onset or diagnosis of 10 chronic physical conditions.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Eighteen face-to-face, cross-sectional household 
surveys of community-dwelling adults were conducted in 17 countries (47 609 individuals; 2 032 
942 person-years) from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2011. The Composite International 
Diagnostic Interview was used to retrospectively assess the lifetime prevalence and age at onset of 
DSM-IV–identified mental disorders. Data analysis was performed from January 3, 2012, to 
September 30, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Lifetime history of physical conditions was 
ascertained via self-report of physician’s diagnosis and year of onset or diagnosis. Survival 
analyses estimated the associations of temporally prior first onset of mental disorders with 
subsequent onset or diagnosis of physical conditions.
RESULTS—Most associations between 16 mental disorders and subsequent onset or diagnosis of 
10 physical conditions were statistically significant, with odds ratios (ORs) (95% CIs) ranging 
from 1.2 (1.0–1.5) to 3.6 (2.0–6.6). The associations were attenuated after adjustment for mental 
disorder comorbidity, but mood, anxiety, substance use, and impulse control disorders remained 
significantly associated with onset of between 7 and all 10 of the physical conditions (ORs [95% 
CIs] from 1.2 [1.1–1.3] to 2.0 [1.4–2.8]). An increasing number of mental disorders experienced 
over the life course was significantly associated with increasing odds of onset or diagnosis of all 
10 types of physical conditions, with ORs (95% CIs) for 1 mental disorder ranging from 1.3 (1.1–
1.6) to 1.8 (1.4–2.2) and ORs (95% CIs) for 5 or more mental disorders ranging from 1.9 (1.4–2.7)

 to 4.0 (2.5–6.5). In population-attributable risk estimates, specific mental disorders were 
associated with 1.5% to 13.3% of physical condition onsets.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—These findings suggest that mental disorders of all 
kinds are associated with an increased risk of onset of a wide range of chronic physical conditions. 
Current efforts to improve the physical health of individuals with mental disorders may be too 
narrowly focused on the small group with the most severe mental disorders. Interventions aimed at 
the primary prevention of chronic physical diseases should optimally be integrated into treatment 
of all mental disorders in primary and secondary care from early in the disorder course.
Much evidence has accrued from record linkage and clinical studies attesting to the higher 
incidence of chronic physical conditions and associated earlier mortality among individuals 
with severe mental illness,1–3 as well as among those with common mental disorders.4–7 
However, the findings of these studies are limited to those who receive treatment,1 so it is 
less clear whether mental disorders in the community (untreated and treated) might be linked 
with subsequent risk of chronic physical conditions. It also remains unclear as to how 
generalized these associations might be across a range of physical health outcomes. This 
information has important implications for mental health care and the primary prevention of 
chronic physical disease.
Ideally, associations between mental disorders in the general population and subsequent 
physical conditions should be investigated in studies with prospective designs. However, to 
examine associations between a wide range of mental disorders and physical conditions 
prospectively is challenging because it requires very large cohorts with information on both 
mental and physical disorders to be followed over many decades. As an interim approach, 
we have investigated mental-physical sequential associations using retrospectively collected 
data from the World Mental Health (WMH) surveys. The collection of information on age at 
onset of mental disorders and age at onset or diagnosis of chronic physical conditions in 
these surveys allows the use of survival analysis to examine predictive associations between 
temporally prior mental disorders and the subsequent onset or diagnosis of physical 
conditions. Previous publications have reported on associations between mental disorders 
and specific physical conditions.8–12 The present study provides a broader overview by 
describing associations between mental disorders and a wide range of physical condition 
outcomes collectively. It is from this broader perspective that important clinical and public 
health implications emerge.
Methods
Samples and Procedures
This study used all WMH surveys with the requisite data conducted in 17 countries (Table 
1). Translation protocols and measures taken to ensure data accuracy, cross-national 
consistency, and protection of respondents are described in detail elsewhere.14 All 
respondents provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by the 
institutional review boards in each country; there was no financial compensation.14 The 
study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2011.

 A stratified, multistage, clustered-area, probability-sampling strategy was used to select 
adult respondents (≥18 years) in most WMH countries. Most of the surveys were based on 
nationally representative household samples; Colombia, Mexico, and Shenzhen were based 
on nationally representative household samples in urbanized areas. In most countries, 
internal subsampling was used to reduce respondent burden by dividing the interview into 2 
parts. All respondents completed part 1, which included the core diagnostic assessment of 
most mental disorders. All part 1 respondents who met lifetime criteria for any mental 
disorder and a probability sample of respondents without mental disorders were given part 2 
of the instrument (at the same interview), which assessed the remaining mental disorders and 
collected information on physical conditions and covariates. Data acquired from the part 2 
respondents were weighted by the inverse of their probability of selection to adjust for 
differential sampling.14
Analyses in this article are based on the weighted part 2 subsample (47 609 individuals; 2 
032 942 person-years). Additional weighting was used to adjust for differential probabilities 
of selection within households, to adjust for nonresponse, and to match the samples to 
population sociodemographic distributions.
Measures
Mental Disorders—All surveys used the WMH-Composite International Diagnostic 
Interview (CIDI, 3.014), a fully structured interview, to assess lifetime history of mental 
disorders. Disorders were evaluated using the definitions and criteria of the DSM-IV. Age-
at-onset reports (obtained in connection with the first onset of clusters of symptoms 
indicative of the disorder) were obtained using a probing strategy that experimental 
research15 has shown yields responses with a more plausible age-at-onset distribution than 
the standard CIDI questionnaire. Clinical reappraisal interviews using the Structured 
Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID) in several WMH countries documented 
generally good CIDI-SCID concordance, with the CIDI being conservative compared with 
the SCID for lifetime estimates.16
Chronic Physical Conditions—Respondents were asked whether a health professional 
had ever told them they had any of a series of medical conditions (eg, heart disease, stroke, 
cancer, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, asthma, other chronic lung disease, and peptic ulcer) 
or whether they had a lifetime history of a chronic symptomatic condition (eg, arthritis, 
chronic back or neck pain, chronic or severe headaches, and any other chronic pain). 
Respondents were asked how old they were when the condition was first diagnosed (for the 
medical conditions) or first experienced the condition (for the symptomatic conditions). This 
year is referred to herein as the age at onset of these conditions, although it is recognized 
that the underlying disease process of many of these conditions usually develops over many 
years. For all but 2 of these conditions (chronic pain and ulcer), people with childhood onset 
(aged <21 years) of the physical condition were excluded from analyses because early onset 
of these conditions is likely to be congenital.

 Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was performed from January 3, 2012, to September 30, 2015. Discrete-time 
survival analyses17 with person-year as the unit of analysis were used to investigate 
associations between temporally prior lifetime history of a mental disorder and the 
subsequent onset of a physical condition. Separate models were estimated for each physical 
condition. Initial models included each of the 16 mental disorders as predictors, but given 
the similarity in the pattern of findings across mental disorders, mental disorder classes (any 
mood disorder, anxiety disorder, substance use disorder, and impulse control disorder) were 
included as predictors in subsequent models. For these analyses, a person-year data set was 
created with each year in the life of each respondent treated as a separate observational 
record up to and including the age at onset of the physical condition or their age at interview 
(whichever came first), with the year of physical condition onset coded as 1 and earlier years 
coded as 0 on a dichotomous outcome variable. Mental disorders were coded as 1 from the 
year after first onset of each mental disorder. This time lag ensured that first onsets of a 
mental disorder in the same year as the physical condition did not count as a predictor. Only 
person-years up to the diagnosis or onset of the physical condition were analyzed so that 
only mental disorder episodes occurring before the onset of the physical condition were 
included in the predictor set. Survival coefficients are presented as odds ratios (ORs), 
indicating the relative odds of the physical condition onset for a person with the mental 
disorder compared with people without that disorder (including those without a history of 
any mental disorder).
A series of bivariate and multivariate models were developed, including the predictor mental 
disorder (or disorder class), plus covariates. Covariates included in the statistical models 
were age cohorts (18–29, 30–44, 45–59, and ≥60 years), sex, person-years, country, 
educational level (low, low-average, high-average, and high based on the number of years of 
education), and smoking history (current, ever, or never). Multivariate models included 
controls for other mental disorders and also investigated associations between the number of 
mental disorders experienced over the life course and the onset of the physical condition.
Evaluation of whether associations varied by age at physical condition onset or diagnosis 
was undertaken by including interaction terms between person-years (coded as a continuous 
variable) and mental disorder classes in the multivariate models. Population-attributable risk 
proportions (PARPs) calculated-the proportion of the outcome variables associated with the 
predictor mental disorders in the bivariate models (eTable 1 in the Supplement reports the 
method). Country variation in the associations was evaluated in 2 ways. First, the I2 level 
was calculated to describe the percentage of total variation in multivariate associations 
across countries that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance.18 For most models, 
significant (P < .05) heterogeneity was not observed (eTable 2 in the Supplement), but 2 
examples of where country variation was significant (in the associations of mood and 
anxiety disorders with heart disease) are shown in funnel plots in eFigure 1 and eFigure 2 in 
the Supplement. Second, interaction terms of mental disorders with individual countries 
were included in the multivariate models; most of the interaction coefficients were not 
significant (eTable 3 in the Supplement). All further analyses were conducted on the pooled 
all-countries data set. Because the WMH data are both clustered and weighted, the design-

 based Taylor series linearization19 implemented in version 10 of the SUDAAN software 
system was used to estimate SEs and evaluate the statistical significance of coefficients.
Results
Bivariate Associations of Specific Mental Disorders
After adjustment for age, sex, country, smoking, and educational level, a history of 
depressive disorder was associated with an increased odds of subsequent onset of arthritis 
(OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.5–1.8) (Table 2). Most associations between the 16 mental disorders 
and the subsequent onset/diagnosis of the 10 physical conditions were statistically 
significant. Depression, some of the anxiety disorders (panic disorder, specific phobia, and 
posttraumatic stress disorder), and alcohol abuse were associated with all 10 physical 
conditions; bipolar disorder, social phobia, intermittent explosive disorder, and alcohol 
dependence were associated with 9 of 10 physical conditions. Significant associations 
ranged from a low OR of 1.2 (95% CI, 1.0–1.5) between depression and subsequent cancer 
to a high OR of 3.6 (95% CI, 2.0–6.6) between bulimia nervosa and subsequent diabetes 
mellitus, with the ORs for most associations falling between 1.5 and 2.0.
Bivariate and Multivariate Associations of Mental Disorder Classes
The bivariate models reported in Table 3 include the same controls as the models in Table 2 
to allow comparison with the results for individual disorders. All mental disorder classes 
were associated with all of the physical condition outcomes, with ORs ranging from 1.2 to 
2.6. The single physical condition most strongly associated with temporally prior mental 
disorders was chronic lung disease, with ORs (95% CIs) ranging from 1.7 (1.3–2.3) (anxiety 
disorder) to 2.6 (1.7–3.8) (impulse control disorder). Cancer had the weakest associations 
with mental disorders, with ORs (95% CIs) from 1.2 (1.0–1.4) for anxiety disorder to 1.6 
(1.2–2.1) for impulse control disorder. Mental disorder comorbidity was not taken into 
account in these associations.
Analysis using multivariate models demonstrated associations from models adjusting for 
mental disorder comorbidity, with the effect that the magnitude of associations was reduced 
by approximately 50%. This finding indicates that some of the strength of the bivariate 
associations was the result of the multiple disorders that many individuals experience over 
the life course rather than to one disorder. The multivariate ORs (95% CIs) ranged from 1.2 
(1.0–1.4) for the association of mood disorder with subsequent heart disease and 1.2 (1.1–
1.3) for the association of substance use disorder with subsequent chronic pain to 2.0 (1.4–
2.8) for the association of substance use disorders with subsequent stroke. Substance use 
disorders remained significantly associated with all 10 of the physical condition outcomes, 
mood disorders remained associated-with 8 of the physical condition outcomes, and anxiety 
disorders and impulse control disorders remained associated with 7 outcomes. Mood and 
anxiety disorders were no longer significantly associated with cancer after comorbidity 
adjustment.
Associations between an increasing number of mental disorders experienced over the life 
course and subsequent onset or diagnosis of chronic physical conditions were demonstrated

 (Table 3). Associations (ORs [95% CI]) for 1 mental disorder ranged from lows of 1.3 (1.0–
1.5; 1.1–1.6) for cancer and asthma, respectively, to highs of 1.8 (1.7–1.9; 1.4–2.2) for 
chronic pain and chronic lung disease, respectively. Associations (ORs [95% CI]) with 5 or 
more disorders ranged from 1.9 (1.4–2.7) with cancer to 4.0 (2.5–6.5) with chronic lung 
disease. For all physical conditions (except cancer), a dose-response pattern was evident; 
even for cancer, the association (OR; 95% CI) with 5 or more disorders was stronger (1.9; 
1.4–2.7) than the association with 1 disorder (1.3; 1.0–1.5).
Variation of Associations by Age at Physical Condition Onset or Diagnosis
For mood disorders (eTable 4 in the Supplement), the ORs for the mood disorder × person-
year interactions were all less than 1.0, with 8 of 10 of the ORs being significant. This 
finding indicates that the association between mood disorder and the physical condition 
outcomes was stronger among people with younger (relative to older) age at onset or 
diagnosis of the physical condition. This finding could be a substantive effect (such that the 
potential for mental health to affect physical health diminishes as the deleterious effects of 
aging increase) or an artifact of survival bias in these samples. This same pattern was evident 
for a few of the physical outcomes in associations with the other 3 classes of mental 
disorders.
PARP Associations
We calculated population-level associations of mental disorders (unadjusted for 
comorbidity) with physical outcomes. Mood disorders were predictors of 3.0% to 13.3% of 
physical condition onsets, with corresponding ranges of 3.2% to 11.6% for anxiety 
disorders, 1.5% to 4.6% for impulse control disorders, and 2.2% to 10.7% for substance use 
disorders (Table 4). The variation in magnitude of these PARPs reflects, in part, the variation 
in the prevalence of mental disorders (highest for anxiety disorders and lowest for impulse 
control disorders).
Discussion
This investigation of mental-physical sequential associations in multiple countries yielded 4 
main findings. First, most of the matrix of possible associations between 16 mental disorders 
and subsequent onset or diagnosis of 10 physical conditions were statistically significant 
after controlling for covariates. Second, associations were reduced in magnitude after 
controlling for mental disorder comorbidity, but all mental disorder classes (mood, anxiety, 
impulse control, and substance use) remained associated with between 7 and 10 of the 
physical condition outcomes. Third, increasing numbers of mental disorders experienced 
over the life course were associated with increasing odds of subsequent onset or diagnosis of 
all 10 physical conditions. Fourth, specific mental disorders were associated with between 
1.5% and 13.3% of chronic physical condition onsets. To put the PARPS in context, high 
body mass index, which has similarities to mental disorders in being a prevalent risk factor 
associated with multiple outcomes, is associated with 13% to 15% of cardiometabolic 
deaths.20 The PARPs in the present study were modest, but they were based on specific 
types of mental disorders in the general population, including both remitted and unremitted

 disorders, and so may substantially underestimate the effect of the more severe and 
comorbid disorders typically seen in treatment settings.
The study design limitations need to be considered. Retrospective recall of age at onset of 
mental disorders is subject to bias, and, although the probing strategy used in the WMH 
surveys has been shown to reduce some types of bias (telescoping), it is likely that some 
inaccuracy in onset timing remains. Recall of age at onset of physical conditions may be 
more reliable,21 but the retrospective recall of event timing for both mental and physical 
conditions remains a significant limitation of this study. The cross-sectional design also 
raises the possibility of spurious or inflated associations through mental disorders at the time 
of interview affecting self-report of physical conditions; however, sensitivity analyses 
excluding individuals with mental disorders at the time of the interview found no meaningful 
alteration in associations.9
Retrospective assessment is known to lead to underreporting of mental disorders and, to a 
lesser extent, of physical conditions.22 The assessment of physical conditions in the present 
study was less rigorous than the assessment of mental disorders, and self-report of 
physician-assigned diagnoses will miss some conditions that are asymptomatic in the early 
stages. These limitations will undoubtedly have resulted in some individuals with a history 
of mental disorder and/or physical condition being misclassified as noncases; this kind of 
misclassification tends to bias associations toward the null, making the results conservative. 
Survival bias may also contribute to the conservative nature of these findings. In addition, 
the associations were based on disorders ranging in severity and across remitted and 
unremitted disorders; therefore, the strength of associations is probably understimated in 
individuals with severe or recurrent disorders.
Although observational studies cannot determine whether these mental-physical sequential 
associations reflect causal links, we note that the dose-response pattern in the association of 
number of mental disorders with risk of physical condition onset is consistent with a causal 
interpretation. Moreover, many plausible causal mechanisms have been identified including 
biological,23,24 behavioral,25 effects of psychotropic medications,26 and inequities in health 
care provision.27 However, some potential common underlying determinants of comorbid 
mental and physical ill health in adulthood have not yet been fully explored, such as 
genetics, diet, low birth weight, and predicators of early adverse circumstances.28
Even with the limitations of the retrospective method, the findings of this study are worthy 
of note. Although evidence for specific mental-physical associations will gradually 
accumulate from prospective studies, the resulting piecemeal perspective may obscure our 
study’s broader message that mental disorders of all types are associated with increased odds 
of a wide range of chronic physical conditions. Current efforts to address health inequalities 
among the mentally ill are almost entirely focused on those with severe mental illness, who 
make up a very small proportion of those with mental disorders.

 Conclusions
The study findings need to be confirmed in prospective designs, but they suggest that the 
deleterious effects of mental disorders on physical health (if causal) accumulate over the life 
course and increase with mental disorder comorbidity. If this is the case, then given the early 
onset of most mental disorders and the similarly early etiopathogenesis of many chronic 
physical conditions,29 treatment of all mental disorders should optimally incorporate 
attention to physical health and health behaviors, with this parallel focus on physical health 
beginning as early in the course of the mental disorder as possible. Disappointing outcomes 
from depression treatment trials in patients with heart disease30 may indicate that mental-
physical comorbidity could be better addressed by an early focus on the physical health of 
those with mental disorders rather than a later focus on the mental health of those with 
chronic physical conditions. Existing programs have proved effective in improving health 
behaviors of individuals with mental disorders.31 Psychological interventions could be 
augmented to include a focus on health behaviors. In addition, much could be done in 
primary care to optimize chronic disease prevention approaches for individuals with mental 
disorders so that these approaches are more effective than they are at the present time.32 
Movement toward the primary prevention of chronic physical conditions among people with 
mental disorders would do much to enhance their quality and quantity of life.
