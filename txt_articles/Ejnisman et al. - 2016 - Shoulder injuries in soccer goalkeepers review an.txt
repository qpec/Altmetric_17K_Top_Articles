Abstract: In the last years, shoulder injuries have represented an increasing health problem in 
soccer players. The goalkeepers are more exposed to shoulder disorders than other field  
players. 
Injury prevention exercises for upper limbs were cited in few studies involving  
throwing athletes, 
but we know that goalkeepers need a specific program. The purpose of this study is to describe 
the development of an adapted Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) 11+ 
program, namely the FIFA 11+ shoulder, which targets the prevention of shoulder injuries in 
soccer goalkeepers. The FIFA 11+ shoulder program is structured into three parts: general 
warming-up exercises, exercises to improve strength and balance of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, 
and finger muscles, and advanced exercises for core stability and muscle control. The exercises 
were selected based on recommendations from studies demonstrating high electromyographic 
activity.

Introduction
Soccer is the most popular sport worldwide, and participation in this sport can be 
associated with injuries.1 On average, an elite soccer player suffers from 1.5 to 7.6 
injuries each 1,000 hours of training and 12 to 35 injuries each 1,000 hours of match.2,3 
Kirkendall and Dvorak4 reported that the most common injured site was the lower limb 
(67.7%), followed by the upper limb (13.4%).
In the last years, shoulder injuries have represented an increasing health problem 
in soccer players.5 The modern soccer has been characterized by high speed, pressing, 
and marking.5 Many researchers have reported that goalkeepers are more exposed to 
upper limb lesion than other field soccer players.6,7
The percentage of shoulder damage that occurred during Athens 2004 and EURO 
2004 was 3.8% and 4.4%, respectively.8 Junge et al9 reported shoulder injuries between 
2% and 13% during a 4-year period (from 1998 to 2001) of international tournaments. 
The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) collected data during 
Japan/Korea World Cup (2002) and Germany World Cup (2006) and reported higher 
percentages of upper extremity injury (4.6% and 8.2%, respectively).
A third of shoulder injuries (28%) sustained by professional soccer players are 
severe because of which participation in training and games is stopped for $28 days.10 
In a study of the UEFA European Championships, a total of 34 severe injuries were 
recorded, two of which were shoulder dislocation.11 Hart and Funk12 reported that a 
previous shoulder injury is a significant risk factor of more or repeated injuries than

 other soccer injuries in general. A majority of serious  
soccer 
shoulder injuries affect the glenoid labrum (84%), and a 
smaller number are labral injuries with associated rotator 
cuff involvement (8%). A minority (8%) are isolated rotator 
cuff injuries.
Prevention of soccer injuries: what 
about the upper extremity?
Since the launch of FIFA 11+, key publications have 
 
confirmed the preventive effects of the program and have 
evaluated its performance-improving effects in female as 
well as male amateur soccer players.13 Considerable reduc-
tions in the number of injured players, ranging between 
30% and 70%, have been observed among the teams that 
implemented the FIFA 11+ program.14 This program has been 
mainly developed to prevent lower limb injuries – there is 
no specific program in the current literature to prevent upper 
limb lesions in soccer players.
Wilk et al15 developed the Advanced Throwers Ten Exer-
cise Program. This program consists of exercises that restore 
muscle balance and symmetry in the overhead throwing ath-
lete, which is necessary for the symptom-free return to sports 
after lesion. Injury prevention exercises for upper limbs are 
cited in few studies involving throwing athletes,16,17 but we 
know that soccer goalkeepers need a specific program.
McCall et al18 cited that the “five” most common injury 
risk-screening tests used by national soccer teams were 
the evaluation of flexibility (dynamic and static), physical 
fitness, joint mobility, balance/proprioception, and muscle 
endurance and peak strength. In the same study, the authors 
reported the exercise-based injury prevention strategies that 
were not specific for upper or lower limb injuries. The key 
preventive exercises used by national teams were similar to 
those reported for premier league clubs, albeit in a slightly 
different order of importance.18 For example, core, balance/
proprioception, and eccentric exercises also feature in the 
“Top five” of national teams’ exercises. At the time of this 
review, there was no direct scientific evidence that core 
exercises can reduce injury risk in top-level soccer players, 
although evidence from other sports suggests some preven-
tive capacity.19
Despite being supported for shoulder rehabilitation by 
some studies, eccentric exercise has a weak level of  
evidence 
in the scientific literature20 as it cannot be ascertained whether 
its beneficial effects on injury are specifically from the eccen-
tric component.21,22 Finally, while flexibility is an important 
exercise for practitioners, two systematic reviews23,24 have 
shown that there is no conclusive evidence to support 
 
stretching to prevent injuries. Both reviews, however, also 
highlight that there is no sufficient reason to discontinue 
flexibility exercises in the training program.
The aim of this paper is to describe the development of an 
adapted FIFA 11+ program, namely the FIFA 11+ shoulder 
(FIFA 11+S), which targets the prevention of shoulder injuries 
in soccer goalkeepers.
Development of the FIFA 11+S 
program
The FIFA 11+S program is structured into sections according 
to the FIFA 11+ program already successfully used to prevent 
lesions.25 The exercises were selected based on recommen-
dations from studies demonstrating high electromyographic 
activity,26–32 including additional exercises to provide varia-
tion and progression.
The program was developed by an international group 
of experts, including orthopedics expert in shoulder lesions, 
physiotherapists with experience in soccer lesion, and 
 
specialists in sports rehabilitation. For all the exercises, 
correct performance is of great importance. Therefore, the 
coach should supervise the program and correct the players 
if necessary.
The program consists of three parts: general warming-up 
exercises (part I), exercises to develop strength and balance 
of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and finger muscles (part II), 
and advanced exercises for core stability and muscle control 
(part III). The FIFA 11+S takes ∼20–25 minutes to complete 
and replaces the usual warm-up before training (Figure 1). 
All exercises focus on core stability, neuromuscular control, 
eccentric rotator strength, and agility.
These exercises should be performed three times per 
week and should be added to the training taken by the  
soccer 
goalkeeper. Part I exercises should be done for 7 minutes as 
a general warm-up. Part II exercises should be  
performed 
for 9–10 minutes in a low-resistance (light  
tubing strength 
or 2–3 kg), high-repetition format (three sets of 15–20 rep-
etitions), in order to improve strength and local muscular 
endurance.33 Exercise should be changed according to the 
tolerance of the athlete (to A instead of B and C exercises, 
Figure 1). In part III, the athlete must do the exercises at 
high velocities with five or six sets of 15–20 repetitions not 
exceeding 9–10 minutes; these exercises are performed to 
increase local muscular endurance.33
The emphasis is given to the strengthening of some 
muscle groups such as the shoulder rotator cuff. The external 
and internal concentric rotation power balance ratio must be 
maintained between 0.6 and 0.8.34 Regarding athletes with

 instability, Ellenbecker and Davies35 suggested as a preventive 
measure an increase of 10% in the normal strength relation 
(from 66% to 76%), altering the rotator’s relation from 2/3 to 
3/4. Internal rotator is an important component of the throw-
ing movement; on the other hand, the antagonist (external 
rotator) must be strong enough to decelerate the throwing 
movement and to stop the ball when grabbing it.
Other important muscles that should be focused on are 
the anterior serratus and lower and medium trapezium to 
prevent the scapular dyskinesia. The power of these muscles 
and superior trapezium keeps the correct scapulohumeral 
rhythm.32,36–39

exercises that simulate falls and movements on the ground. 
In both cases, the CORE activation is needed to maintain 
the correct muscular activation sequence, and transfer and 
dissipate energy in the kinetic chain.29,40
The diagonal exercises are used to strengthen the 
muscles. The diagonal D1 in the flexor pattern (accelera-
tion) and extension (deceleration) activates the rotator cuff, 
scapular waist, and deltoid muscles, which is important 
to improve the co-activation of the intra-articular power 
couples.37,41
The sensory-motor training is an important part of the 
program. The lack of shoulder stability increases the need 
of the sensory-motor system for neuromuscular control.

 as critical points of the kinetic chain, making their training 
extremely important for the prevention of lesions.42
Plyometric training is also included, which facilitates 
the increase of excitability of the neural system and the 
reactive capacity of the neuromuscular system of healthy 
athletes’ shoulders. This training includes the eccentric 
movement that produces elastic energy and transforms this 
accumulated energy into kinetic energy which is transferred 
to the concentric phase using the shortening–strengthening 
cycle.30–32,43
Conclusion and future perspectives
We would like to recommend scientists and clinicians to 
also consider researching upper extremity injury in soccer 
goalkeepers. Considering favorable results from the previ-
ously published research on FIFA 11+ with soccer athletes, 
we hypothesize the following benefits of FIFA 11+S: fewer 
injuries, fewer costs, and better performance by soccer 
goalkeepers.
One of the strengths of this study is the type of athletes 
involved, who have not been discussed in the literature, 
considering the difficulties in obtaining a program specific 
for goalkeepers. The lack of results about the use of this 
preventive program is the limitation of this paper.
Future research should investigate the effects of FIFA 
11+S to prevent injuries of the upper limbs and improve 
performance of the soccer goalkeepers.
