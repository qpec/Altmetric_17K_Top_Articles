Fusidic acid (FA) activity was evaluated against 2,002 clinical staphylococcal isolates collected in U.S. hospitals during 2014. FA
(MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 �g/ml) inhibited 99.8% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates at <1 �g/ml. Only four S. aureus isolates dis-
played FA values of >2 �g/ml (three strains with fusC and one with an L461K substitution in fusA), and they were isolated from
patients in four states. In conclusion, FA demonstrated sustained, potent activity against this recent collection of U.S.
staphylococci.
S
taphylococcus spp., especially Staphylococcus aureus, are a com-
mon cause of serious infections with multidrug resistance
(MDR), and these species have emerged as a major therapeutic
challenge throughout the world (1, 2). The global emergence of
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (3) and strains with re-
duced vancomycin susceptibility (4, 5) have limited treatment op-
tions. For orally available antistaphylococcal agents, surveillance
in the United States in 2013 found fluoroquinolone (levofloxa-
cin), erythromycin, and clindamycin resistance rates of 64.2%,
87.8%, and 26.7%, respectively, among MRSA isolates, with an
overall MRSA prevalence of 47.9% (6).
Due to these resistance issues, older agents with activity against
MRSA are being reconsidered (7). One such agent with proven
antistaphylococcal activity is fusidic acid (7, 8). Fusidic acid has
been used in Europe and Australia since 1962 and in Canada since
1980 (8, 9) but has not been approved for clinical use by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration. Fusidic acid, with low toxicity
and a unique mechanism of action (elongation factor G [EF-G])
that lacks significant cross-resistance to other antibacterial classes,
is regarded as a potentially valuable therapeutic option in the
United States, which has very low rates of fusidic acid resistance
(8–10). Fusidic acid resistance has been described via mutations in
the EF-G-encoding gene (fusA) or more recently described mobile
elements (fusB and fusC). An intrinsic resistance gene, fusD, is
found in Staphylococcus saprophyticus isolates (10).
Phase 2 clinical development of fusidic acid has concluded in
the United States for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin
structure infections (ABSSSI) (11) and chronic prosthetic joint
infections (PJI) (12). A phase 3 trial in ABSSSI and an exploratory
phase 3 study in refractory bone and joint infections (BJI) are
being initiated. In this clinical development plan, a novel oral
dosing regimen is being utilized to optimize bioavailability and
exposure, hence reducing the potential for resistance emergence
(13). When used with rifampin to minimize the potential for re-
sistance development in a phase 2 trial, expected fusidic acid
plasma levels were decreased, presumably by rifampin CYP3A in-
duction, thus compromising optimal fusidic acid exposures (12).
In the present study, we report on the results of a U.S. resis-
tance surveillance program, comparing the activity of fusidic acid
and other antimicrobial agents against clinical isolates of S. aureus
(n � 1,804) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (n �
198) obtained from patients in 2014.

 Nonduplicated staphylococcal isolates (n � 2,002) were col-
lected prospectively from 26 U.S. medical centers. These isolates
were recovered consecutively from patients with ABSSSI, bactere-
mia, and respiratory tract infections, and fewer isolates were col-
lected from other sources of infection. Isolates were identified by
the submitting laboratories and confirmed by JMI Laboratories
(North Liberty, IA, USA) using standard bacteriological algo-
rithms and methodologies, including matrix-assisted laser de-
sorption ionization–time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrom-
etry (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA) and 16S rRNA
sequencing.
All isolates were tested by the broth microdilution method (14)
using commercially prepared and validated panels (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA) in cation-adjusted
Mueller-Hinton broth. Fusidic acid was obtained from Cempra,
Inc. (Chapel Hill, NC USA). Interpretation of the MIC results was
in accordance with published criteria (15, 16). Quality control
strains included S. aureus ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis
ATCC 29212.
As previously described, resistance mechanisms were detected
by PCR (fusB, fusC, fusD) and sequencing (fusA, fusE) (17, 18).
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed to deter-
mine genetic relatedness.
Among 1,804 S. aureus isolates, fusidic acid (MIC50/90, 0.12/
0.12 �g/ml) inhibited 99.8% of isolates at �1 �g/ml (Table 1).
Using EUCAST breakpoint criteria (�1 �g/ml), fusidic acid sus-
ceptibility rates were very high, regardless of the methicillin-
susceptibility profile: 99.6% for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus
(MSSA) and 100.0% for MRSA (16). Among comparator agents
with available oral formulations, linezolid, clindamycin, tetracy-
cline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) demon-
strated the highest susceptibility rates against S. aureus strains at
99.9%, 83.5%, 94.9%, and 97.9%, respectively (Table 2). Overall
against S. aureus, susceptibility rates were higher for agents ad-
ministered by the parenteral route, i.e., vancomycin (100.0%),
daptomycin (99.9%), and gentamicin (97.7%). Only four S. au-
reus strains (0.22%) displayed fusidic acid values of �1 �g/ml.
Three isolates (from patients in Iowa, New York, and Florida)
were positive for acquired fusC and had MIC values of 4 to 8
�g/ml. One isolate (from a patient in Georgia) had an L461K
substitution in fusA and an MIC of �16 �g/ml.
For the CoNS strains, 90.4% were inhibited by fusidic acid at
MIC values of �1 �g/ml, and the activity against CoNS exhibited
differences between the methicillin-susceptible (MS) and methi-
cillin-resistant (MR) subsets. MSCoNS and MRCoNS displayed
the same MIC50 result of 0.06 �g/ml, whereas MRCoNS MIC90
results were negatively influenced by the fusidic acid-nonsuscep-
tible isolates (13.6% with MICs of �1 �g/ml). Fusidic acid resis-
tance mechanisms found among CoNS isolates were fusB (n � 9),
fusC (n � 3), fusD (n � 6, S. saprophyticus), and a D597E substi-
tution in fusA (n �1). PFGE analyses showed that none of the
CoNS strains were clonally related. Linezolid was the only orally
administered comparator agent with wide coverage for CoNS iso-
lates, inhibiting nearly all (99.0%) of the strains at the current
breakpoint concentration (15). Clindamycin, TMP-SMX, and tet-
racycline demonstrated only modest activity against these patho-
gens (70.2%, 76.8%, and 84.3% susceptible, respectively).
Although fusidic acid has not been used clinically in the United
States, it has exhibited clinical efficacy and low toxicity in the
treatment of serious MRSA infections in many countries (5, 9, 19).
However, fusidic acid used as topical monotherapy for chronic
skin conditions has been associated with the emergence of resis-
tance among S. aureus and CoNS in several nations, thus compro-
mising its utility for both topical and systemic therapy (9, 20–26).
PJI is the most serious complication of joint replacement surgery,
and antimicrobial therapy is generally prolonged or indefinite.
Initial therapy of 4 to 6 weeks of pathogen-specific intravenous or
highly bioavailable oral therapy is followed by indefinite chronic
oral antimicrobial suppression therapy based on in vitro suscepti-
bility of the pathogen and patient allergies or intolerances. There-
fore, monitoring for toxicity development and efficacy is highly
recommended (27). Fusidic acid has many favorable attributes
(e.g., low toxicity and high oral bioavailability) that make it a
desirable candidate for the treatment of ABSSSI and for long-term
treatment of BJI and PJI in the United States and elsewhere. In this
report, we describe the results of a contemporary (2014) surveil-
lance survey designed to assess fusidic acid activity against clinical
isolates of staphylococci. Overall, fusidic acid demonstrated high
in vitro potency against S. aureus (MIC90, 0.12 �g/ml) and CoNS
(MIC90, 0.25 �g/ml), regardless of resistances to other antimicro-
bials. We detected only 4 (0.22%) S. aureus isolates and 19 (9.6%)
CoNS isolates that displayed elevated fusidic acid values at �1

 �g/ml. Mechanisms of resistance were also observed, without ev-
idence of genetic relatedness. These recent U.S. results were very
similar to U.S. resistance surveillance results in 2008, which
showed only 0.3% of S. aureus isolates (0.6% in MRSA and 0.1%
in MSSA) and 6.4% of CoNS isolates with resistance (fusidic acid
MIC, �1 �g/ml) (18). As in the earlier study, the mechanisms
responsible for fusidic acid resistance were quite varied, usually
fusB and fusC (18, 28, 29).
The observed low prevalence of fusidic acid resistance among
staphylococci in U.S. surveillance results between 2008 and 2014
documents a lack of resistance emergence or spread of clones dur-
ing this 7-year period. The findings add further support and con-
fidence to the continued clinical development of this orally avail-
able agent and provide a contemporary baseline of fusidic acid
activity for the United States.
