A rt i c l e s
Human ESCs represent a promising source for cellular replacement 
therapies owing to their availability, pluripotency, and unlimited self-
renewal capacity. However, they also carry risks of neoplastic change, 
uncontrolled proliferation, and differentiation to inappropriate cell 
types1,2. The eye is advantageous in investigating hESC-based cell 
therapy as it is accessible and confined, and the transplanted cells can 
be monitored directly in vivo, with the possibility of being removed 
or destroyed if there is evidence of neoplastic change3,4. Furthermore, 
long-term immunosuppression can be delivered locally.
Late AMD is characterized by irreversible cell loss, initially of RPE 
cells and subsequently of neuroretinal and choroidal cells5, and thus 
may be amenable to hESC-based cell therapy4. The disease process 
includes damage to the RPE’s specialized basement membrane, Bruch’s 
membrane5. Currently, treatments exist only for the exudative or ‘wet’ 
form of AMD. These treatments rely on angiogenesis inhibitors6 or 
indirect transplantation of an autologous RPE–Bruch’s complex (retinal 
translocation surgery)7. However, the former treatment only suppresses 
the disease, requiring long-term repeat delivery, and the latter, although 
restoring the macular anatomy, does not prevent disease recurrence. 
 
There is no treatment for atrophic ‘dry’ AMD, which is characterized by 
RPE loss and progressive neuroretinal cellular dysfunction.
Suspensions of hESC-derived RPE (hESC-RPE) cells have been 
transplanted in human subjects with dry AMD and Stargardt’s disease, 
but the extent of cell survival and restoration of vision remains ambig-
uous8. A recent, single-patient report described transplantation of an 
autologous induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)–derived RPE patch 
on its own secreted basement membrane9. The iPSC-RPE survived 
with maintenance, but no improvement, of visual acuity at 12 months. 
We developed a therapeutic, biocompatible hESC-RPE monolayer 
on a coated synthetic membrane, herein termed a ‘patch’, for trans-
plantation in wet and early-stage dry AMD. The choice of membrane 
material and its preparation, including the human vitronectin coating, 
has not been described previously to our knowledge. In contrast to 
RPE suspensions, cells on the patch are delivered fully differentiated, 
polarized, and with the tight junction barrier formed, that is, in a 
form close to their native configuration. The synthetic membrane 
allows the patch to be handled easily and robustly. The main disad-
vantage of the patch is that it requires a purpose-built delivery tool 
and a more complicated surgery compared to cell suspensions, and 
the use of hESCs may require immunosuppression, unlike an autolo-
gous cell source. Our delivery tool (Supplementary Fig. 1) confers 
the benefit of protecting the patch within the tip, thereby minimizing

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) remains a major cause of blindness, with dysfunction and loss of retinal pigment 
epithelium (RPE) central to disease progression. We engineered an RPE patch comprising a fully differentiated, human 
embryonic stem cell (hESC)–derived RPE monolayer on a coated, synthetic basement membrane. We delivered the patch, 
using a purpose-designed microsurgical tool, into the subretinal space of one eye in each of two patients with severe exudative 
AMD. Primary endpoints were incidence and severity of adverse events and proportion of subjects with improved best-corrected 
visual acuity of 15 letters or more. We report successful delivery and survival of the RPE patch by biomicroscopy and optical 
coherence tomography, and a visual acuity gain of 29 and 21 letters in the two patients, respectively, over 12 months. Only local 
immunosuppression was used long-term. We also present the preclinical surgical, cell safety and tumorigenicity studies leading to 
trial approval. This work supports the feasibility and safety of hESC-RPE patch transplantation as a regenerative strategy for AMD.

cell loss, cell distribution within the eye, and physical damage to the 
RPE monolayer.
The clinical trial was designed as a phase 1, open-label, safety and 
feasibility study of implantation of an hESC-RPE patch in subjects 
with acute wet AMD and recent rapid vision decline. For safety rea-
sons and to obtain an early efficacy signal, the trial involved patients 
with severe wet AMD only, although we aim to study the RPE patch 
in early dry AMD in the future. We reported three serious adverse 
events to the regulator. These were exposure of the suture of the fluo-
cinolone implant used for immunosuppression, a retinal detachment, 
and worsening of diabetes following oral prednisolone. All three inci-
dents required readmission to the hospital, with the first two incidents 
requiring further surgery and the third being treated medically. The 
three incidents were treated successfully. Both patients achieved an 
improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA—vision with an 
optometrist-determined best glasses-corrected vision) of >15 letters 
at 12 months after transplantation.
RESULTS
Engineering an RPE patch
Our protocol for manufacturing a clinical-grade RPE patch is sum-
marized in Figure 1. RPE cells were differentiated from the SHEF-1.3 
hESC line, which had been derived from the SHEF-1 hESC line. We 
used a spontaneous differentiation method10, an approach that has 
been described earlier by others and has been applied to primate11 
and human12,13 ESCs. Spontaneous differentiation limits the need for 
additional factors, facilitating compliance with good manufacturing 
practice (GMP) guidelines, and with clear advantages over vector-
driven methods in terms of the safety and stability of the final RPE. 
Our differentiation protocol differs from another similar protocol10 
in that we used Essential 8 medium rather than human feeder cells 
during expansion and the early phase of differentiation to avoid expo-
sure to another cell type and to fulfill GMP guidance. While several 
methods are used to produce hESC-RPE11,13–15, because of epigenetic 
variation from the earliest stages after derivation of hESCs, no method 
is universally effective15,16. With our protocol, 20–30% of hESC colo-
nies differentiated to RPE (data not shown), which is a similar rate to 
that of other spontaneous methods11,13 but less efficient than some 
augmented methods15–17.
Subsequent RPE characterization (Fig. 2) used immunocy-
tochemistry (Fig. 2a), electron microscopy (Fig. 2c), pigment- 
epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) secretion profile testing (Fig. 2b), 
and a functional phagocytosis assay (Fig. 2d). During manufactur-
ing, in-process testing, including in situ hybridization with a specific 
oligonucleotide probe for LIN28A mRNA12, was undertaken to detect 
hESC impurity at the single-cell level. Differentiated RPE was dis-
carded if any LIN28A-positive cells were detected. The hESC-RPE 
cells were seeded at confluence onto a human-vitronectin-coated 
polyester membrane. A 6 × 3 mm (17 mm2) therapeutic element 
with ~100,000 cells (PF-05206388 in the regulatory documentation) 
was cut to size with a purpose-built punch and loaded into a sealed 
transport container (Fig. 1). Immediately before release for human 
transplantation, the cell layer was recharacterized as RPE by means of 
a visual inspection release test encompassing cell dose, cell identity, 
and patch coverage checks.
Mouse teratoma and in vitro cell-spiking studies 
We tested tumorigenicity of the hESC-RPE in NIH III nude mice 
(Fig. 3a–e). Cell suspensions were used as the mouse eye is too small 
to administer a patch. Two initial studies conducted with undiffer-
entiated hESCs showed that teratomas could form. In these stud-
ies, cell suspensions were injected subretinally, intramuscularly and

subcutaneously, with mice followed for 26 weeks. Subsequently, we 
studied the tumorigenicity of hESC-RPE cells under good laboratory 
practice (GLP) conditions, including a positive control group injected 
with undifferentiated hESCs. Given our finding that undifferentiated 
hESCs formed teratomas, we conducted in vitro cell-spiking studies 
to examine whether hESCs survive the RPE manufacturing process 
and culture-seeding conditions.
In the first study, injection of 4.5–8.8 × 104 undifferentiated hESCs 
into the subretinal space of NIH III mice resulted in localized neo-
plastic formation in almost half the males injected (12/30) but in very 
few females (2/30). The tumors showed evidence of pluripotency and 
appeared to be composed of mesenchymal and epithelial lineages 
(data not shown).
In the second study of undifferentiated hESCs, neoplastic masses were 
observed in the injected eye of 12/15 female and 5/5 male mice after 
cell administration into the subretinal space. Teratomas were observed 
microscopically in the thigh of all female mice that received 3.6 × 104 or 
8.23 × 105 undifferentiated hESCs in BD Matrigel by the intramuscular 
route, and in the left flank of 2/5 and 1/11 female mice that received 3.6 
× 104 or 8.23 × 105 undifferentiated hESCs in BD Matrigel, respectively, 
by the subcutaneous route. Masses were composed of structures derived 
from all embryonic germ layers (data not shown).
In the third study, conducted with cells manufactured under GLP 
conditions, suspensions of hESC-RPE cells, or of undifferentiated 
hESCs as a positive tumorigenic control, were injected subretinally 
in NIH III mice. In a total of 80 mice injected with suspensions of 
hESC-RPE cells, no teratomas were detected (Fig. 3b). Pigmented 
hESC-RPE cells were observed lining the surface of the retina or lens 
in the injected eyes of some mice given 6.04 × 104 hESC-RPE cells 
(Fig. 3e, i,ii,iii) at 26 weeks.
In the same study, administration of undifferentiated hESCs was 
associated with ocular teratoma formation in four males and five 
females given 4.28 × 104 cells, all of which were prematurely eutha-
nized (between days 46–62), and in a single male given 4.51 × 103 cells, 
which survived to the 26 week end point of the experiments. (Fig. 3c). 
In addition, mesenchymal tumors classified as “Not Otherwise 
Specified” were present in two males given 4.28 × 104 undifferenti-
ated hESCs (Fig. 3d) and perilenticular mesenchymal hyperplasia 
in animals of both sexes given 4.51 × 103 cells or 4.28 × 104 cells. All 
tumors were composed of human cells, as confirmed by immunohis-
tochemistry using an anti-human mitochondrial marker (data not 
shown). Eyes injected with undifferentiated hESCs also exhibited an 
increase in the incidence and severity of non-proliferative changes, 
including lenticular degeneration, posterior synechiae of the iris, and

RPE markers as part of the characterization of the monolayer as RPE (each represents a single experiment with no repeats). Scale bars, 25

premelanosomes, and ZO1 expression allows easy identification of tight junctions. Absence of Ki67 confirms that cells are not proliferating. Other 
characteristic RPE markers (CRALBP, MITF, OTX2), crucial for melanogenesis and visual cycle, are also present. Immunocytochemistry was performed 
once on hESC-RPE cells. BEST1, bestrophin 1; CRALBP, cellular retinyladehyde-binding protein; DAPI, diamidino-2-phenylidole; MITF, microthalmia

(POS), demonstrating hESC-RPE phagocytosis. The extent of phagocytosis was also examined after treatment of the hESC-RPE with MERTK antibody 
(hESC-RPE + blocker). Data shown are mean internalized POS ± s.e.m. (n = 3 biologically independent cell cultures in each group). Pre-incubation with 
MERTK antibody had a significant effect on the number of POS ingested by hESC-RPE (P = 0.0000103075196107, two-tailed Student’s t-test). This 
was a single experiment with no replication. Below the graph, confocal micrographs show the internalized POS with a green fluorescent marker (POS) in 
hESC-RPE and its relative absence in hESC-RPE with MERTK antibody (hESC-RPE + blocker).

retinal detachment (data not shown). Transplantation of either dif-
ferentiated or undifferentiated hESCs did not affect body weight.
Given the tumor formation observed with undifferentiated hESCs, 
we aimed to determine whether hESC-RPE contained any residual 
pluripotent cells or could support the survival of pluripotent cells, 
as this would constitute a teratoma risk. Using immunostaining 
and flow cytometric analysis of cells expressing the pluripotency 
marker Tra-1-60 (Abcam 16288, Cambridge, UK), we detected no 
undifferentiated hESCs in dissociated RPE foci before the expansion 
phase or at 6 to 8 weeks after seeding at the end of the expansion 
phase (Supplementary Fig. 2). We spiked undifferentiated hESCs 
into the RPE at 1, 10, 20, or 50% of total cells at the start of the 
expansion phase. This did not affect the quality of the resulting 6-
to-8-week-old cultures at the end of the expansion phase, which 
showed cobblestone morphology and pigmentation, and stained 
strongly for PMEL17 (an RPE marker that indicates the presence 
of premelanosomes). By 2 d post-spiking, viable Tra-1-60-positive 
cells were no longer detectable by flow cytometry (data not shown). 
This finding was supported by propidium iodide staining, which 
showed that ~96% of hESCs died when dissociated and seeded in 
the same manner as RPE prepared for expansion (Supplementary 
 
Fig. 3). The cells that survived in some experiments did not have 
hESC-like morphology and failed to stain for Tra-1-60 or the pro-
liferation marker Ki67, suggesting that they had differentiated or 
senesced (Supplementary Fig. 3d,e).
Pig single-dose studies 
Studies of surgical feasibility and safety of delivery of the RPE patch 
as well as studies of local and systemic biodistribution and toxicity 
were carried out in pigs (Fig. 3f–k). Human and pig eyes are similar 
in size, which allowed for administration of the full-size patch. Two 
studies were performed; the second used the same clinical surgical 
technique as in the human clinical trial. Biodistribution of hESC-RPE 
cells was evaluated in more than ten sites using qPCR detection of 
multiple human cell markers.
In the first pig study, patch delivery was successful in all 20 ani-
mals, as assessed by intraoperative observation of the patch under 
the neural retina and histological sections showing the patch in the

subretinal space (Fig. 3h,i). No retinal detachments were noted in any 
animal. We found surviving human cells by light microscopy at 2 h, 
2 d, and 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks after implantation (RPE patch: n = 12; 
control patch without cells: n = 8; figure 3 H-K). Human cell survival 
was demonstrated despite immunosuppression having been limited 
to the peri-operative period using oral prednisolone. Surviving cells 
remained pigmented (Fig. 3f,j). Cells expressed RPE-specific cell 
markers, showed no proliferation activity, and did not migrate away 
from the membrane (data not shown). Photoreceptor survival above 
the patch was observed only in animals that received an RPE patch, 
as assessed by histology (Fig. 3h). The control membrane without 
cells did not support photoreceptor survival (Fig. 3i). Microscopically, 
retinal architecture was intact in most animals receiving human cells. 
Macrophages were seen and appeared to have phagocytosed some 
transplanted RPE cells to form large pigmented cells (data not shown). 
Lymphocytic infiltrate was not observed except in 2 animals at 2 and 6 
weeks. Animals that received the control membrane also had macro-
phage infiltrates but no lymphocytic response (data not shown). These 
results demonstrated that patch transplantation with hESC-RPE sur-
vival was surgically feasible without significant safety issues.
The second pig study differed from the first in that we used the pur-
pose-built surgical tool, which has a protective cradle at the tip from 
which the patch is mechanically pushed out when the tip is in the sub-
retinal space (Supplementary Fig. 1). The study was undertaken under 
GLP conditions, a standardized set of requirements to ensure quality 
and systematic management of the experiment. In this case, it dictated 
standards for the operating and animal facilities and for the personnel 
who ran the trial, and defined the conditions and requirements for the 
keeping and monitoring of animals in the study, including the feeding 
regimen. Correct surgical delivery of ten RPE patches and ten coated 
membranes without RPE was achieved in 20 pigs as assessed by clinical 
examination and histology (Fig. 3f,g). Good cell cover was observed at 
the 6-week time point in the ten animals that received RPE cells (Fig. 3f). 
Retinal detachment and rupture of the lens capsule were observed in one 
male and one female implanted with the patch. There was no evidence of 
weight loss or early death in any animal. At 6 months after implantation, 
no hESC-RPE cells were detected at the implantation site or elsewhere in 
H&E sections of the ten eyes receiving the RPE patch. Anti-human TRA-
1-85 immunostaining of the operated eye and optic nerve from these 
animals was also negative. Microscopic findings of chronic inflammation 
were seen restricted to the subretinal implantation site, at 6 months in the 
implanted (left) eye of all animals, and were consistent with the intraocu-
lar surgical implantation procedure. The microscopic findings included 
fibrosis, osseous metaplasia, and small numbers of macrophages and 
multinucleate giant cells (data not shown). Atrophy of the photoreceptor 
layer in overlying retina was also present (data not shown). Findings were 
of similar incidence and severity in both control and cell-treated animals. 
No positive amplification of any human-specific genes was observed in 
adrenal, bone marrow (rib and femur), brain, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, 
lymph nodes, optic nerve, spleen, or thymus, which were evaluated by 
qPCR, indicating that the cells did not appear to migrate or survive away 
from the site of implantation. The second pig study confirmed the surgi-
cal feasibility and reliability of the delivery tool and the lack of systemic 
or local distribution of the hESC-RPE cells.

the first two (Figs. 4–7). In addition to safety, the trial investigated 
whether the synthetic membrane would facilitate mechanical delivery 
of the RPE monolayer, whether the transplanted cells could be sus-
tained long-term with local immunosuppression only, and whether 
early signals of potential efficacy were evident.
Using the surgical delivery tool, we placed one RPE patch in the 
subretinal space, under the fovea, in the affected eye of each patient. 
Correct placement was confirmed in both patients by stereo- 
biomicroscopy, fundus photography, and spectral domain optical 
coherence tomography (SD-OCT) (Figs. 4b, i,ii and 5b, i,ii).
In patient 1, OCT and native-level autofluorescence immediately 
after surgery showed a ‘double thickness’ of RPE in one area nasal to 
the fovea, indicating overlap of native RPE and the patch (Fig. 4b,c,e). 
In all other areas in patient 1, and in all areas in patient 2, a single 
layer of RPE on OCT suggested there was no residual native RPE over 
the patch (Figs. 4b, ii and 5b, ii). In both patients, hESC–RPE was 
present over the full area of the patch at 12 months as evidenced by 
dark pigmented cells covering the patch, although unevenly, photos 
of the fundus, and a hyper-reflective monolayer on the patch seen 
by SD-OCT (Figs. 4b, i,ii and 5b, i,ii and 6a,b). In both patients, the 
patches showed uneven autofluorescence (Figs. 4e, iii and 5e, iii), 
which suggests functioning RPE phagocytosis18,19. Also, visible in 
both patients were darker, pigmented areas continuous with the patch, 
which may represent RPE cell migration off the patch onto adjacent 
RPE-deficient areas. These areas spread from the patch edge outward 
over the first 6 months after surgery before stabilization (Fig. 6a,b). 
The areas were contiguous with the patch RPE signal on OCT and 
were absent in areas where the native RPE layer persisted. There was 
no evidence of neoplastic transformation either on regular review of 
the fundus by an ocular oncologist or by serial ocular ultrasound.
In addition to RPE survival, we studied visual recovery in both 
cases. Testing was always carried out by an independent quali-
fied observer. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study 
(ETDRS) letter chart was used to define BCVA, which improved 
over 12 months from 10 to 39 and from 8 to 29 letters, in patients 
1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 7a,c). Microperimetry, a test of percep-
tion of microlocalized light stimuli, showed visual fixation at the 
center of the patch and vision over the patch in both patients at

12 months (Figs. 4b,i and 5b, i). Figures 4b,i and 5b,i, show sample 
areas of visual sensitivity localized totally within the patch. Reading 
speed improved from 1.7 to 82.8 and from 0 to 47.8 words/min in 
patients 1 and 2, respectively, over 12 months on the University 
of Minnesota MNRead test (Fig. 7b,d), an improvement and final 
level not found in the Submacular Surgery Trial20. Pelli–Robson 
contrast sensitivity scores (Log) improved from 0.45 to 1.35 
in patient 1, and 0 to 1.05 in patient 2 over 12 months. At each 
point that showed microperimetry sensitivity over hESC-RPE, we 
observed choroidal filling by angiography (Figs. 4e, i,ii and 5e, i,ii); 
 
RPE-autofluorescence (Figs. 4e, iii and 5e, iii) and presence of the 
ellipsoid layer (indicative of preserved photoreceptors) by SD-OCT 
(Figs. 4c, i,ii and 5c, i,ii). We note that it was not possible to ascer-
tain whether the ellipsoid zone was present pre-operatively, owing 
to the poor detail in the pre-operative OCT scans (Figs. 4a, ii and 
5a, ii). Rtx1 adaptive optics camera images showed survival of cone 
photoreceptors in the areas corresponding to areas of sensitivity on 
microperimetry (Figs. 4d, i and 5d, i).
We reported three serious adverse events that were unrelated to 
the RPE patch. The first was exposure of the suture of the fluoci-
nolone implant in patient 1, which required conjunctival revision 
surgery. The other two, both in patient 2, were a worsening of dia-
betes following oral prednisolone, which was treated medically, and 
a retinal detachment. The retinal detachment was an asymptomatic, 
infero-temporal, proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR)-associated 
traction retinal detachment under silicone, which did not extend 
past the inferior arcade and thus did not affect the implant. It was 
observed at the 8-week follow-up, with the retina having been com-
pletely attached at the 4-week check. It was treated with a single 
surgery with peeling of the PVR membranes, inferior retinectomy 
of the peripheral retina (180 degrees), and laser to the retinectomy 
edge. The silicone oil was retained. The retina was attached at the 
end of the surgery and has remained attached after subsequent 
 
surgery to remove the silicone oil. There was a residual epiretinal band 
over the posterior pole with some focal macular traction (Figs. 5b, i 
and 6b), which was not treated.
Ocular pressures were never raised in either patient. No changes of 
concern were noted in the liver and renal function tests and by liver 
ultrasound in either patient. On full-field electro-retinography (ERG) 
recording, there was evidence of a mild but consistent reduction in 
photoreceptor function at 6 months in both patients with additional 
consequent electro-oculography (EOG) reduction (in the eyes oper-
ated on). The reduction in photoreceptor function persisted in patient 
1 but recovered in patient 2 by 12 months.
DISCUSSION
The results presented here provide an early indication of the safety 
and feasibility of manufacturing an hESC-RPE monolayer on a syn-
thetic basement membrane and delivering the patch into the subreti-
nal space as a potential treatment for AMD. Our data suggest early 
efficacy, stability, and safety of the RPE patch for up to 12 months in 
two patients with severe vision loss from very severe wet AMD.
hESC-RPE on a membrane shows optimized differentiation, polari-
zation, viability, and maturation of the monolayer at the time of deliv-
ery that contrasts favorably with delivery of cell suspensions, where 
the cells are necessarily not in a monolayer and thereby not polarized 
or fully differentiated. Proper orientation is readily confirmed by the 
color difference between the white membrane and the pigmented 
RPE. Cells delivered in suspension may be lost due to reflux through 
the retinotomy, with potential vitreous seeding, and the cells undergo 
shear stress and damage when ejected through the delivery cannula21. 
Furthermore, cells in suspension are required to adhere to and form 
a monolayer on a damaged native Bruch’s membrane, which leads 
to poorer cell survival and widespread apoptosis22. Previous work 
showed poor differentiation using suspensions and that RPE mono-
layers on membranes appear superior23.
Therapeutic human RPE patch transplantation has been reported 
using a harvested autologous RPE–Bruch’s membrane–choroid patch 
from the same eye24–26 and an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-
derived RPE patch9. The main advantages of our system over these are 
mechanical ease of handling due to the rigidity of the synthetic mem-
brane. The tool we developed also allowed consistent patch delivery 
with a small localized retinal detachment over the macula, whereas 
with the intraoperative harvested autologous technique, half of the 
entire retina must be reflected to ensure consistent delivery without 
RPE damage27,28. The availability of an off-the-shelf patch would be 
especially advantageous and critical in cases of severe wet AMD with 
sudden vision loss, as described in this study. Treatment is required 
rapidly29, and an autologous iPSC patch could not be prepared in a 
suitable time frame for transplantation. It is also possible that the hESC-
RPE patch may alter the natural history of the disease as the cells are 
zero years old, rather than the 60-plus years of the patients, and are not 
genetically or environmentally predisposed to develop AMD; however, 
only further investigation can address this. The main disadvantage of 
our technology is the need for immunosuppression, although for the 
two cases reported here we have demonstrated that only local immu-
nosuppression was necessary for long-term hESC-RPE survival.
We present the preclinical safety and tumorigenicity studies that 
supported regulatory approval of our clinical study. The literature 
suggests that adult human RPE cells30, terminally differentiated 
hESC-RPE31, and spontaneously immortalized RPE cells32 are non-
proliferative cell types and appear to lack the potential to form ter-
atomas. The GLP study of tumorigenicity in NIH III mice showed 
that the hESC-RPE was not associated with tumor formation or other 
notable proliferative changes. Injected hESC-RPE cells survived for 
the full 26 weeks in some animals. Transplantation of undifferenti-
ated hESCs under the same conditions was associated with teratoma

formation as well as unclassified mesenchymal tumors, peri-lenticular 
mesenchymal hyperplasia, and an increase in the incidence and sever-
ity of degenerative changes in the treated eye.
Owing to tumor formation by undifferentiated hESCs, a major 
safety concern was the potential for survival and persistence of 
undifferentiated hESCs through the manufacturing process. In-proc-
ess testing for undifferentiated cells is essential in the manufacture 
of any cell product from pluripotent cells for human transplanta-
tion. Spiking studies and single-cell labeling studies demonstrated 
no detectable undifferentiated cells in the final product. Even when 
we contaminated primary foci of hESC-RPE cells with up to 50% 
undifferentiated hESCs, no pluripotent hESC cells were present by 
the end of the expansion phase. Furthermore, hESCs were not viable 
when dissociated and seeded into RPE expansion conditions. Thus, 
we demonstrated that undifferentiated hESCs were not detectable at 
stage 4 of the production process, and that the RPE differentiation 
medium does not support the survival of hESCs.
Our preclinical studies in pigs investigated surgical feasibility, bio-
distribution, and toxicity. We showed consistent facilitated mechani-
cal delivery of the RPE patch in all 20 pigs operated on in the GLP 
final study using our purpose-built tool. Implantation of the control 
membrane without cells led predictably to a foreign body reaction, 
but this was minimal when RPE cells covered the membrane. The 
presence of RPE was also associated with persistence of the native 
 
photoreceptor layer and less retinal atrophy than membrane alone in 
both pig and clinical studies.
A qPCR analysis of systemic biodistribution in pigs at 26 weeks 
after implantation of one clinical-sized graft (~100,000 hESC-RPE 
cells) showed no evidence that cells migrated or survived away from 
the site of administration. The lack of distribution of the cells is con-
sistent with previous studies on ocular administration of RPE cells32. 
This is also supported by our NIH III mouse study, in which teratomas 
from undifferentiated hESCs were found only in the eye, where the 
cells had been administered, and not in tissues distal to the site, sug-
gesting that undifferentiated hESCs do not migrate or do not survive 
away from the site of implantation.
In the GLP pig study with no immunosuppression, no definitive 
hESC-RPE cells were identified at 26 weeks, whereas persistent hESC-
RPE cells were found at 6 weeks in the earlier pig studies (in which 
some animals were immunosuppressed perioperatively), and at 26 
weeks in the NIH III mouse teratoma studies (immune-deficient ani-
mals). Histology of the implanted patch at 6 weeks from animals in 
the first pig study showed persistence of human RPE and support of 
normal retinal architecture relative to animals receiving the mem-
brane alone. Microscopic findings consistent with a localized chronic 
inflammatory reaction around the polyester membrane were present 
in animals from both groups in the GLP pig study at 6 months, in the 
absence of any RPE cell cover. There was no difference in the inci-
dence or severity of the inflammatory reaction in either group.
In the clinical trial, the transplanted RPE patch survived, as dem-
onstrated by a clear RPE signal on OCT for 12 months and the vis-
ible persistence of a pigmented cellular monolayer, although some 
of these cells may have been pigmented macrophages. There was 
evidence of early autofluorescence in both patients 1 and 2, sug-
gesting that RPE phagocytosis has commenced18,19. The retina over 
the patch was thinned in patient 1 but not in patient 2, which may 
reflect a difference in pre-operative disease or level of microtrauma 
from manipulation during surgery. It is possible that the decrease in 
central pigmentation in patient 1 represented cell loss from delayed 
rejection. Both patients retained features of normal architecture 
and visible areas of the ellipsoid zone. Furthermore, there was clear 
 
evidence of retinal function over the patch, as demonstrated by fixa-
tion microperimetry, which showed focal sensitivity, and increased 
visual acuity and reading speed, all of which were sustained or 
improved over 12 months post-transplant. However, in the absence 
of a control, proving the improvement was due to the transplant is 
not possible. The improvement in reading exceeded that of similar 
cases in the Submacular Surgery Trial20. Visual function remained 
variable across the transplanted area, with poor visual function and 
thinning centrally in patient 1, which we feel may reflect intra-opera-
tive surgical trauma.
While histological evidence of hESC-RPE survival was not pos-
sible, the extensive number of structural and functional features dis-
cussed above support the conclusion that the hESC-RPE survived. 
Furthermore, the presence of transplanted hESC-RPE cells imme-
diately adjacent to the neuroretina suggest that they are associated 
with retinal function over the patch. We did not intentionally remove 
the subretinal choroidal neovascular membrane, but cannot exclude 
that it was removed inadvertently. Therefore, the effect of the original 
choroidal neovascular membrane on function remains ambiguous. 
However, the co-localization of choroidal perfusion, survival of hESC-
RPE, retinal sensitivity, and presence of photoreceptors strongly sup-
port the conclusion that the visual improvement and stability was 
associated with the transplanted RPE patch.
Retinal detachment was the most severe clinical complication seen. 
The GLP pig studies had two retinal detachments in 20 animals, which 
is similar to the rates reported for early human autologous trans-
plantation and translocation surgeries33,34. The retinal detachment in 
patient 2 of the clinical trial was likely a PVR-associated detachment 
that occurred between 4 and 8 weeks. It was treated with a single 
operation using standard techniques. The retinal detachment did not 
extend far enough to reach the patch. However, despite the delivery of 
RPE cells on a patch and in a protected delivery device, both of which 
minimize the shedding of RPE cells into the vitreous, we cannot be 
certain that no hESC-RPE cells were released nor that they did not 
contribute to the risk of developing PVR. The true surgical risk can 
be assessed accurately only with a larger series of patients.
In patient 1, there was an area of native RPE over the patch that was 
clearly delineated and separate from the large area over the patch where 
the native RPE was lost and only hESC-RPE was present. Notably, the 
patient fixated not over native RPE but over the RPE patch. Subjectively, 
patient 1 acknowledged that her vision improved relative to the pre-
operative state and that she could see letters and read directly with 
the central vision; however, she described troublesome distortion, 
similar to that experienced by patients who have had previous retinal 
detachment or wet AMD. The second patient described his vision as 
continuously improving but also being “dimmer” than before the onset 
of the disease, which is consistent with his longer-standing disease at 
presentation and, likely, more damaged neuroretina.
Reporting these first two cases at 12 months is valuable because the 
functional improvement, robust imaging data, lack of major safety con-
cerns, and demonstration of sufficiency of local immunosuppression 
represent steps in support of hESC-based regenerative therapy for AMD 
and other diseases of the eye. We show that differentiation of hESCs into 
a therapeutic cell with delivery, survival, and rescue of vision in very 
severe disease is feasible. Although 12 months is sufficient to begin to 
describe cell survival and clinical outcomes, it is early in terms of safety 
monitoring, especially for late teratoma formation. The patients will 
be followed for five years after surgery. These two early cases are also 
instructive as they show an encouraging outcome despite very advanced 
disease, which increases the complexity of surgery and involves more-
damaged neuroretina. Additionally, there was no evidence of recurrence

of the neovascular membrane and no need to administer angiogenesis 
inhibitors to either patient at 12 months, although with only two cases 
it is difficult to attribute this to the transplant.
The role of immune privilege in the subretinal space remains 
ambiguous, and the immunological effect of the surgery and patch 
transplant is unknown. Stability of the transplant was achieved with 
immunosuppression consisting of perioperative oral prednisolone 
and long-term intraocular steroid implants. For patient 2, who has 
type II diabetes, there was a period of poor blood sugar control with 
the need to add insulin, due to the systemic steroid use. Given the 
concerns about long-term systemic immunosuppression, a notable 
finding of this study is that the transplanted hESC-RPE cells survived 
at least 12 months with only local immunosuppression. Although 
long-term, local immunosuppression can be provided in the eye with-
out systemic side effects, the possibility of long-term ocular morbid-
ity remains. In our two patients there was no associated intraocular 
pressure rise or need for pressure-reducing medication.
Stem-cell-based tissue transplantation is a potentially effective 
treatment strategy for neurodegenerative or other diseases with irre-
versible cell loss. Here we addressed challenges related to engineering, 
manufacturing, and delivering a clinical-grade hESC-RPE patch, lead-
ing to stabilization and improvement of vision for at least 12 months 
in two subjects with severe vision loss from AMD. These findings 
support further investigation of our approach as an alternative treat-
ment strategy for AMD.

Ethics statement. All animal (mouse and pig) procedures were conducted 
in accordance with the provisions of the United Kingdom Animals Scientific 
Procedures Act (ASPA) 1986. The animal experimentation under the ASPA is 
overseen by the Home Office, UK government, in England.
The mouse teratoma studies were carried out by the Independent Contract 
Research (CRO) Organization Huntington Life Sciences (HLS), now Envigo 
(Alconbury/Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, UK). (HLS Animal Project - 
Licence number PCD 70/8702).
The pig surgery was carried out under GLP conditions at the Northwick Park 
animal experimental surgery facility (Northwick Park and St Mark’s Hospital, 
Harrow, Middlesex, UK). Pigs were cared for in an independent GLP registered 
facility including throughout the 6-month’s follow-up period. The animal report-
ing including organ sampling was carried out independently by HLS.
Pfizer Inc. sponsored and was the sole funding source of the clinical trial. 
Two subjects out of a planned 10 were enrolled before Pfizer suspended 
funding for strategic commercial reasons unrelated to this trial. The cells for 
transplantation were prepared to the state of confluent RPE at Roslin Cells 
Ltd. (Edinburgh, United Kingdom,) before transport to London. The prepa-
ration and cutting of the patch was completed at Cells for Sight (Institute of 
Ophthalmology, Bath St., London, UK).
Approval of the clinical trial was granted by the UK Medicines and Health 
Products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), the Gene Therapy Advisory 
Committee (GTAC), the Moorfields Research Governance Committee and the 
London–West London & GTAC Research Ethics Committee (Clinicaltrials.gov: 
NCT01691261). The study complied with Good Clinical Practice guidelines 
according to the European Clinical Trials Directive (Directive 2001 EU/20/EC), 
the Declaration of Helsinki and has an independent External Data Monitoring 
Committee (E-DMC). The data monitoring committee had three representa-
tives who were retinal surgeons, with two having specialty expertise in ocular 
oncology and the third in ocular immunology. Informed consent was obtained 
from each patient. The study compliance with protocol was reviewed regularly, 
and none of the recorded protocol deviations had an impact on subject safety or 
study integrity. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data 
and data analyses. The datasets generated by HLS and Aros are being transferred 
to the academic authors.
Statistics. The only statistical analysis reported was for the phagocytosis study 
(Fig. 2d). Data shown are mean ± s.e.m., n = 3 biologically independent cell 
cultures in each group. As the n is less than 10, individual data points are indi-
cated. Analysis was by two-tailed Student’s t-test with P = 0.0000103075196107. 
This was a single experiment with no replication.
Preparation of hESC-RPE (GMP conditions and facility). The original cell 
source, the SHEF-1 hESC (NIBSC - UK Stem Cell Bank - http://www.nibsc.
org/ukstemcellbank) line was expanded according to GMP guidelines at the 
Stem Cell Derivation Facility, Centre for Stem Cell Biology (CSCB), University 
of Sheffield35. The SHEF-1 and 1.3 cell lines were authenticated by a short-term 
repeat analysis fingerprint, which was performed by University of Wisconsin 
Hospital and Clinics. The analysis showed an identical STR genotype profile 
across eight human STR loci for both SHEF-1 and SHEF-1.3. The SHEF-1.3 
cell line was derived from the expanded SHEF-1 hESC cells under the same 
GMP conditions at the same facility. The passage and expansion of SHEF-1.3 
hESCs was carried out in recombinant human vitronectin (VTN-N) (Life 
Technologies)–coated culture vessels. Medium was removed from cultures 
and hESCs were washed with PBS−/− (without Ca++ and Mg++), incubated with 
EDTA (Sigma) until the cell colonies begin to detach. Cells were resuspended 
in Essential 8 (E8) medium (Life Technologies) and seeded onto VTN-N-coated 
culture vessels. hESCs were replenished with E8 medium daily, and passaged 
every 3–4 d depending on visual observations of colony morphology and size.
hESC differentiation to RPE was carried out in flasks coated with plasma-
derived vitronectin (Amsbio). Sets underwent regular media replenishment 
with E8 medium for up to 14 d until hESC colonies were ~80–100% conflu-
ent and then transitioned to TLP medium consisting of 389 ml of Knockout 
DMEM, 1 ml of 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 ml of NEAA (non-essential amino acids), 
 
100 ml of knockout serum and 5 ml of l-glutamine per 500 mL (Invitrogen 
– LifeTechnologies; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were maintained on a 
twice-weekly media replenishment regimen. RPE cells appear in culture as 
distinct pigmented foci; visible to the naked eye, which continue to expand in 
diameter and can be maintained in this culture system for up to 22 weeks.
RPE foci were manually isolated using sterile microblades (Interfocus) and 
collected in TLP medium. Pooled foci were washed with PBS−/− and incubated 
at 37 ± 2 °C with Accutase (Sigma) until a cell suspension is observed. The 
suspension was then passed through a 70-µm cell strainer (Corning), washed 
in TLP medium and counted. The cells were plated on CELLstart-coated (Life 
Technologies) 48-well plates at 4.8 × 104 cells/well. Cells were maintained on a 
twice-weekly media replenishment regimen of TLP medium until they formed 
a confluent, pigmented cell sheet with cobblestone morphology, generally for 
a minimum of 5 weeks.
To ensure safety and purity of the RPE, it was essential to exclude the possibil-
ity of undifferentiated hESCs being administered to a patient. In situ hybridi-
zation was used to assess hESC impurity. Samples of differentiated cells were 
prepared as a monolayer on microscope slides. Specific oligo probes against 
LIN28A mRNA were used to evaluate the presence of hESC in the RPE popula-
tion. LIN28A-stained cells were identified using a nuclear stain. If any LIN28A 
positive cells were detected, the RPE batch would be rejected. Differentiated RPE 
was further assessed using immunocytochemistry against the melanosome-spe-
cific protein PMEL17 (Dako), an RPE cellular marker. PMEL17 positively stained 
cells were counted and expressed as a percentage of total cells. Upon testing of 
cells on representative cell patches, the RPE purity ranged from 99.8 to 100% on 
positive staining of PMEL17 and no LIN28A-positive cells were detected.
RPE cells were assessed using a light microscope for pigmentation, cobble-
stone morphology, health and signs of contamination and processed further 
only if they passed this visual check. Media was removed, cells were washed 
with PBS−/−, and incubated at 37 ± 2 °C with Accutase for 1–2 h until a cell 
suspension was observed. The suspension was passed through a 70-µm cell 
strainer, washed in TLP medium and then counted. Cells were subsequently 
seeded (1.16 × 105 cells/well) into custom manufactured transwells, with poly-
ester membranes coated in plasma-derived human vitronectin. The membrane 
was 10-µm thick polyethylene terephthalate (PET), with a 0.4-µm pore size 
at a density of 1 × 108 pores/cm2 (Sterlitech, Kent, Washington, USA). TLP 
medium was added to the outer well containing the insert, and the plate then 
incubated at 37 ± 2 °C. The RPE cells were maintained with twice weekly TLP 
media replenishment until required for drug product manufacture.
On the day of surgery, the transwell was removed from the culture plate and 
placed directly onto the cutting device. The patch is cut from the membrane 
and is then placed into the storage solution (0.9% sodium chloride) within 
the storage container that is then sealed (Fig. 1a) The patch is assessed visu-
ally through the clear lid of the storage container for integrity, pigmented cell 
coverage and viability. The patch was transported out of the GMP facility and 
transferred to the operating theatre.
Patch cell count. The theoretical cell count on each patch was calculated using 
an observed cell diameter of 14 µm and this gives ~100,000 cells per patch. To 
complement this, two patches from preclinical production batches had the cells 
dissociated and counted and gave counts of 110,000 and 120,000 cells total (i.e., 
a cell diameter of ~12–13 µm). The theoretical cell count of 100,000 was within 
the confidence intervals from these two counts, and so was selected.
Immunocytochemistry. Immunostaining was performed as described previ-
ously17. Briefly, cells were fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M 
phosphate buffer and then blocked and incubated with an appropriate com-
bination of the following primary antibodies: TRA-1-60 (Life Technologies); 
Ki67 (VectorLabs); CRALBP (Thermo Scientific); PMEL17 (Dako); MERTK 
(Abcam); ZO-1 (Life Technologies); OTX2 (Millipore); Bestrophin (Millipore) 
and PEDF (Millipore). They were then incubated in the appropriate secondary 
antibodies including AlexaFluor 647 conjugated donkey anti-mouse Ig-G (Life 
Technologies), 594 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig-G (Life Technologies) 
and Dylight 488 conjugated donkey anti-mouse Ig-M (Startech). Nuclei were 
stained using Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RPE cells immobilized on a mem-
brane were fixed in Karnovsky’s fixative and prepared for TEM as described 
previously17.

PEDF assay. PEDF assay on spent media was completed using a developmental 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Meso Scale Discovery Platform 
S600, Mesoscale, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Phagocytosis assay method. This was based on a previously described 
method36. Purification of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) was performed 
as described previously37. The POS were labeled as described previously38. 
The labeled POS were seeded onto hESC-RPE monolayer patches grown on 
plasma-derived human vitronectin at 1 × 107 POS/ml. In one condition the 
cells were pre-incubated with 1:50 anti MERTK antibody (ab52968, Abcam) 
to block phagocytosis for 1 h. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 
6 h. The samples were fixed and stained as described previously32. To quan-
tify phagocytosis, three distinct areas per patch of hESC-RPE or hESC-RPE 
with blocker (MERTK antibody) (n = 3) were imaged blind on the Zeiss 710 
confocal. The total number of internalized fluorescent POS were counted in a 
 
135 µm × 135 µm area, using the orthogonal view function.
Mouse teratoma studies. The cells tested were undifferentiated SHEF-1.3 
pluripotent hESCs (hereafter ‘hESCs’), and SHEF-1.3 hESC-derived RPE 
(‘hESC-RPE’). The cells were grown at a Pfizer facility before transfer to HLS. 
They were injected into the eyes of NIH III immune-deficient mice (strain 
Crl:NIH-LystbgFoxn1nuBtkxid, 6-7 weeks old; Charles River, UK) at HLS. The 
injections were carried out by A.Vu. and A.A. from University College London. 
Histological and pathological analyses were carried out by HLS, which pro-
vided a report on the study.
The second study was conducted as there were fewer tumors in female 
animals in the first study. It was concluded that this was most likely linked to 
a decline in cell suspension quality for dosing of the females, rather than an 
actual sex difference. The second study focused on female animals. In addi-
tion, we studied the relative rate of teratoma formation following subretinal, 
subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of undifferentiated hESCs in female 
NIH-III mice. In the second study five males were also dosed with undiffer-
entiated hESCs subretinally.
In the third study, under GLP conditions, NIH III mice were administered 
suspensions of hESC-RPE cells or suspensions of undifferentiated hESCs as 
a positive tumorigenic control, with all injections being delivered subreti-
nally. Other controls carried out in all the mouse teratoma studies are listed 
in the tables below. Animals were followed for up to 26 weeks, allowing for 
the assessment of tumors associated with the administration of the test cells, 
prior to the animals having an excessive burden of spontaneous tumors. The 
numbers of animals injected, their sex and the site injected are listed in the 
following table.

Necropsy and histology. At the end of the study animals were subject to a 
detailed necropsy, and macroscopic examinations were performed on all 
treated and control animals. The following tissues were processed for histo-
logical examination: abnormal masses, epididymides, eyes, heart, kidneys, 
liver, lymph nodes (mesenteric, submandibular), optic nerves, ovaries, spleen, 
sternum with bone marrow, testes. Tissues and organs were collected and fixed 
in 10% neutral buffer except the eyes and optic nerves, which were fixed in 
Davidson’s fluid. Following histological processing and review, any teratomas 
or abnormal masses were subject to immunohistochemistry (IHC; anti-human 
mitochondrial marker staining), using a validated method to confirm whether 
these were of human or mouse origin.
Pig transplantation feasibility studies. The analysis of the biodistribution 
data in pig tissues (looking for evidence of human cells in different organs) 
was done using qPCR by the independent CRO Aros (Aarhus, Denmark) with 
reports provided.
Surgical safety, successful delivery of the RPE patch, local and systemic 
biodistribution and toxicology were examined in these studies. The pig was 
selected since the size of the pig eye allowed for the administration of the 
intended full-size patch and the study of surgical feasibility, biocompatibility 
and biodistribution. All pig studies described were performed by the same 
surgeon who operated in the two cases described in the clinical trial (L.d.C.). 
In the second pig study the same clinical surgical technique was used as in 
the human trial.
First pig study. In this study, hESC-RPE cells were seeded onto a BD Matrigel 
(BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium)-coated polyester membrane and 
manually implanted as a 1x3-mm membrane into the subretinal space of pig 
eyes via 20G pars plana vitrectomy, bleb detachment with retinotomy followed 
by air tamponade. Twenty animals underwent surgery and 12 of these received 
hESC-RPE cells on the membrane, 2 at each time point, with the remainder

receiving a membrane without cells, 1 at each time point except 6 weeks where 
there were 3 animals. Six of the animals received immunosuppression with 
oral cyclosporine (650 mg for up to 2 weeks following surgery). Animals were 
observed, euthanized and enucleated at 2 h, 2 d, 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks. Eyes were 
examined by light and electron microscopy.

Toxicity. The feasibility of the surgical procedure and the general safety of 
PF-05206388 was assessed in studies performed in the Large White/Landrace 
hybrid pigs (in all cases).
In the GLP pig study, a group of 5 male and 5 female pigs were administered 
a patch at a dose of 1 graft in the left eye (approximately 100,000 hESC-RPE 
cells on a vitronectin-coated polyester membrane) and observed for 26 weeks 
(6 months). A similarly constituted control group of 5 male and 5 female 
animals received the vitronectin-coated polyester membrane only. The mem-
brane with or without cells was placed into the subretinal space in all 20 pigs 
using the same tool and surgical technique as in the clinical trial. Animals 
received prednisolone (1 mg/kg) orally 7 d before surgery, which continued 
for 14 d post operatively, intravitreal 4 mg triamcinolone acetonide (TCA) 
during the surgery, sub-Tenon TCA 40 mg at the end of surgery, and Carprofen 
 
(4 mg/kg) was given orally postoperative on day 2 of the study. Eye drops of 
0.1% dexamethasone, 0.5% hypromellose and 0.35% neomycin were admin-
istered to all the pigs 4 times per day for 17 d post-surgery.
Systemic distribution of cells. The distribution of the hESC-RPE cells was 
evaluated as part of the pivotal 26-week toxicity study in pigs. The biodis-
tribution was evaluated using qPCR techniques and the human cell mark-
ers huGAPD, huPEDF, HSSRY, huPOU5F1, and huOTX1/2 and the pig 
marker, pigACTB. A total of 60 samples from each animal (5/sex/group) 
that included the following: adrenal, bone marrow (rib and femur), brain (7 
sections), heart (5 sections), kidneys (5 sections), liver (6 sections), lungs 
(5 sections), lymph nodes (4 nodes, total 8 sections), optic nerve (left and 
right, proximal and distal to eye), spleen (5 sections), thymus (3 sections) 
were evaluated. To avoid a high number of false positives, positives in at 
least two individual human markers in the same sample were required. 
No animals that received the matrix only had an increase in amplifying 
 
human transcripts.
Cell spiking studies. The effect of deliberately spiking hESCs into RPE was 
assessed. Different proportions (0, 1, 10, 20, 50 or 100%) of hESCs were mixed 
with dissociated RPE foci (P0 cells), seeded into 96-well plates at 38,000 cells/cm2 
 
and cultured for 6 weeks (P1 cells) using standard RPE culture conditions. 
Feeder-free hESC were used for spiking to eliminate counting inaccuracies 
due to the presence of fibroblast feeder cells. Plates were fixed and stained for 
TRA-1-60 or PMEL17 and the corresponding no primary antibody controls 
 
(n = 4 plates, 1 well/plate stained with each antibody/control). A single-cell sus-
pension of hESCs was also seeded onto Matrigel in mTeSR1 media with ROCK 
inhibitor 2 d before fixing as a positive control for TRA-1-60 staining.
Flow cytometry. Cells were washed with PBS and treated with Accutase to 
produce a single-cell suspension, before pelleting and resuspended in 3% 
BSA/PBS to 1 million/ml. 100,000 cells per sample were incubated on ice for 
20 min with IgM-PE isotype control (eBioscience 12-4752- 82), TRA-1-60-
PE (eBioscience 12-8863-82, PE) or Tra-1-81-PE (eBioscience 12-8883-80) at 
1/20 dilution. For propidium iodide (PI) staining, 100 µl 1.5 µM PI (Sigma) 
was added to 100 µl cells and incubated for 10-15min on ice. Samples were 
pelleted and resuspended in 150 µl PBS alone (for PI stained samples) or PBS 
containing 50 nM TOPRO3 (Invitrogen), a dead cell stain, for IgM and TRA-
1-60 samples. Samples were run on the Accuri Cflow flow cytometer. Debris, 
TOPRO3 positive dead cells (except when deliberately analyzing dead popula-
tions) and cell doublets were excluded from the analysis.
Immunostaining. For live PI staining, 100 µl 1.5 µM PI (Sigma) in PBS 
was added to wells containing 100 µl cells/media. After 10 min PI/media 
was aspirated and replaced with 100 µl 1:10,000 HOESCHT in PBS. Plates 
were imaged live on the Image Express Micro platform (Molecular Devices 
Corporation). For immunostaining, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min, 
washed with PBS−/− and blocked with 5% NDS in 0.3% triton-X/PBS for 
 
1 h. Primary antibody in 1% NDS/TX/PBS was then applied for a further hour 
at room temperature. The antibodies used were TRA-1-60 at 1:100 (Abcam 
16288, mouse), PMEL17 at 1:25 (DAKO HMB45, mouse monoclonal) or 
1:500 Ki67 (Vector K451, rabbit). Wells were washed three times with 1% 
NDS/TX/PBS and secondary antibody, at 1:200 in 1% NDS/TX/PBS applied 
for 1 h at room temperature. For TRA-1-60 Jackson anti-mouse IgM (715-
485-020) was used, for PMEL17 Invitrogen Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse and 
for Ki67 Alexa Fluor 488 antirabbit was used. Wells were then washed three 
times with PBS−/− and 1:10,000 HOESCHT applied. These were imaged on 
the Image Express Micro platform (Molecular Devices Corporation); auto-
mated image analysis was performed using MetaExpress software. The best 
settings for this analysis were determined both by visual observation of the 
plates and by choosing.
The introducer tool. The patch delivery tool was custom designed and manu-
factured with the aim of providing protected delivery of the therapeutic patch 
until its placement into the subretinal space. The device consists of a handle 
containing a mechanism to advance a flexible rod that passes from the wheel, 
through the shaft and to the tip where the rod physically pushes the patch out 
of the tip of the device (Supplementary Fig. 1.). The rod is advanced by virtue 
of the wheel on the handle that the surgeon rolls forward to advance the patch 
out of the device and into position. The patch was loaded manually into the 
tip by drawing it into place with microforceps.
Clinical trial. Subjects in the trial underwent extensive screening and follow-
up investigations including (i) blood sampling for: hematology: hemoglobin, 
hematocrit, RBC, platelet, WBC count and differential; Chemistry: urea, cre-
atinine, glucose, calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, total CO2, AST, ALT, 
total bilirubin, ALP, uric acid, albumin, total protein; HIV, HepB and HepC 
testing; (ii) urinalysis for pH, glucose, protein, blood, ketones, nitrites, leuko-
cyte esterase, microscopy and a drug screen.
A physical examination, including head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, skin, 
heart and lung, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neu-
rological systems, blood pressure, pulse rate and Electrocardiograms, was 
also performed.

Visit schedule. Subjects attended the hospital on an out-patient basis for up 
to 3 d during the screening interval (Day –21 to Day 0). Eligible subjects 
attended the hospital on an out-patient basis the day before surgery (Day 0) 
for pre-surgery assessments. Insertion of PF-05206388 (the hESC-RPE patch) 
occurred the following day (Day 1). Subjects were discharged from the hos-
pital the day after surgery (Day 2). There was a second operative procedure 
performed at the Week 10 visit (Visit 9) whereby the silicone oil, which was 
inserted at the time of PF-05206388 insertion, was removed from the eye. 
Subjects with significant cataracts noted at screening were permitted to have 
the cataracts removed at the time of this second surgical procedure. For the 
first procedure, subjects received up to 1 mg/kg oral prednisolone (up to 60 mg 
 
maximum) daily commenced 2–4 d pre-operatively and continued for at 
least 2 weeks followed by a tailing off over at least one further week. Subjects 
also received single doses of sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg and 
subconjunctival cefuroxime (250 mg in 1 mL) after patch insertion. For the 
second procedure, subjects received up to 1 mg/kg oral prednisolone (up to 
60 mg maximum) daily, commenced 7 d pre-operatively and continued for at 
least 2 weeks followed by a tailing off over at least one further week. Subjects 
also received an intravitreal implant of fluocinolone acetonide either 0.19 
or 0.59 mg as an anti-inflammatory agent and subconjunctival cefuroxime 
 
(250 mg in 1 mL) post-surgery.
The first surgical procedure was carried out on day 1, subjects were dis-
charged from hospital on day 2 and attended for post-surgical evaluations 
at week 1, week 2, week 4, week 8, week 12, week 16, week 24, week 36 
 
and week 52.
Surgical procedures. Transplantation operation: patients underwent standard 
general anesthesia. Routine sterile povidone-iodine 5% preparation of the 
eye with and draping of the face was completed. The eyelids were separated 
with a disposable Barraquer speculum. For patient 1 a cataract was removed 
and a single focus, one-piece, acrylic lens for emmetopria was inserted, at 
the time of the transplant surgery, while patient 2 was already pseudophakic. 
A 270 degree peritomy with a standard 23-gauge infusion and two further 
ports were inserted. Pars plana vitrectomy with induction of PVD when not 
present was completed with subsequent 360 degree Argon laser. A macular 
retinal detachment was created with a 38-gauge de Juan dual bore cannula, the 
retinotomy was enlarged with microscissors and the subretinal space irrigated 
to remove all blood and fibrin. The temporal port was widened for introduc-
tion of the delivery device and insertion of the patch into the subretinal space. 
The macular was reattached with heavy liquid and the retinotomy lasered. A 
routine search of the retinal periphery was completed in both cases with no 
iatrogenic breaks detected. Air/fluid followed by air/silicone oil exchange was 
carried out. The ports were sutured and the infusion removed. Sub-Tenon 
triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg and subconjunctival cefuroxime (250 mg/1 ml) 
 
were injected followed by sub-Tenon (0.5% bupivacaine).
Removal of silicone oil: silicone oil was removed under sub-Tenon local 
anaesthesia. A 23-gauge infusion was inserted in the infero-temporal quadrant 
and a second port created to aspirate the oil. The retinal periphery was exam-
ined for breaks. The ports were closed and subconjunctival antibiotics were 
given. For patient 2 an operation to reattach a detached retina, consisting of 
epiretinal membrane peeling, inferior 180-degree retinectomy and laser, was 
carried out before the oil removal.
Ocular tests and examinations. Biomicroscopic evaluation and intra-ocular 
pressure measurement were carried out using a Haag-Streit 900 slit-lamp 
(Koeniz, Switzerland) and Goldmann applanation tonometer.
Fundus photography, angiography. Color, red-free fundus photographs and 
standard fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography (50°) were acquired 
through dilated pupils using the Topcon TRC Retinal Camera (Oakland, 
 
NJ, USA).
Spectral-domain OCT scan and cSLO reflectance imaging. Volume scan and 
EDI volume scan, 20° × 20°, 49 sections, ART 12, High Speed scans and 30°, 
55° short-wave reflectance autofluorescence images were acquired through 
dilated pupils using the Spectralis OCT (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, 
Heidelberg, Germany).

Adaptive optics. AO images were acquired through dilated pupils using the 
ImagineEyes Camera (Orsey, France). Alignment and data collection were 
repeated for several retinal locations.
For calculation of cellular density, a freely available image-processing pro-
gram (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland) was used to 
manually identify the cones in each subject′s retinal image.
Pattern ERG, full-field ERG and EOG. Pattern ERG, full-field ERG and EOG 
were performed according the ISCEV standards. Dark-adapted ERGs were 
recorded to flashes of 0.01 and 10.0 cd.s.m-2 (DA0.01; DA10.0); light-adapted 
responses were recorded to flashes of 3.0 cd.s.m-2 (30 Hz and 2 Hz).
Automated perimetry. Visual fields were assessed using Humphrey Field 
Analyzer (Carl Zeiss Meditec, AG, Jena, Germany). Central 24-2 Threshold 
tests were performed using Goldmann III white stimulus at background lumi-
nance of 31.5ASB, in SITA-FAST strategy.
Microperimetry. A customized rectangular grid of 9-23 loci covering the area of 
the RPE patch was used in Nidek MP1 Microperimeter (NAVIS software 1.7.2, 
Nidec Technologies, Padova, Italy). Stimuli were set to Goldmann III-V size, 
white color, 200-ms duration and 0-20 dB intensity with background lumi-
nance at 1.27 cd/m2. A single red-cross 2–3° target was used for 30 s fixation 
stability assessment. A 4-2 staircase strategy was employed to assess the retinal 
sensitivity through dilated pupils after 15-min dark adaptation.
ETDRS/logmar BCVA—distant and near, including contrast sensitivity (CS). 
Refracted BCVA was tested by independent trained optometrists using the 
Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts and contrast 
sensitivity tested by the Pelli–Robson chart at 1 m.
Minnesota reading test (MNRead). The MNRead sentences were used to assess 
the visual processing capabilities and eye-movement control required for nor-
mal text reading. Each sentence contains 60 characters (including a space 
between each word and at the end of each line) printed as three lines with 
even left and right margins. The vocabulary used in the sentences is selected 
from high-frequency words that appear in second- and third-grade reading 
material. The charts contain sentences with 19 different print sizes. From the 
recommended viewing distance of 40 cm (16 in), the print size ranges from 
+1.3 to –0.5 logMAR (Snellen equivalents: 20/400–20/6).
B-mode orbital ultrasound. Ultrasound scans were acquired through sterile gel, 
using the ACUSON Sequoia512 system (Siemens Healthcare, USA).
Ocular oncologist review. Specialist Ocular oncologists reviewed the patients 
with biomicroscopic evaluation and review of images from the ultrasound, 
fundus photography and fundus angiography.
Data validation. This manuscript is generated from an unlocked database and 
includes some data that Pfizer is not responsible for validating/storing.

�    Experimental design
1.   Sample size
Describe how sample size was determined.
This was a first in man feasibility and safety study.  The sample size was decided as 
an equivalent of a first in man clinical pilot study and the use of 10-12 patients is 
the convention for this type of trial at Moorfields Eye Hospital. There is no power 
calculation. 
 
For the mice study there was no formal power calculation. In the first study a total 
of 100 animals were used.  This was a pragmatic choice based on practicality, 
availability of animals, availability of injected cells and a minimum requirement of 
at least 10 animals in each of the control groups (The use of a minimum of 10 
animals in a group with a cellular treatment and 5 with a non-cellular control 
continues through all of the animal studies).  
 
The second mouse study was a response to the smaller number of teratomas in 
female animals.  The experiment was repeated with an increased number of 
female animals to resolve the question of whether this was a valid finding (it was 
not).  The addition of the test situations of Intra-Muscular injection and Sub-
cutaneous injection was a requirement of the regulators scientific review. Once 
again a minimum of 10 animals was chosen for each cellular test group and 5 for 
non cell test groups. 
 
The GLP mouse study was based on the signal frequency of the earlier studies but 
not via a formal power calculation. We pragmatically used twice the number of 
animals in the hESC - RPE cellular test groups than in the earlier studies.  We felt 
that as there was a teratoma signal with 10 animals in the undifferentiated hESC 
group from study 2 then it would reasonably be expected to have a signal in twice 
the number of animals. 
 
In the pig studies the first study was to guage many varied aspects including 
surgical practicality - the first time this sort of surgery had been done, behavior of 
the patch in a human size eye, basic cellular and animal survival data and an early 
indication of the use of immuno-suppression. The number also reflected the cost, 
complexity and practicalities of completing extensive large animal studies. 
 
The definitive study used 10 pigs in each group as we had used in all of the mouse 
studies.  We felt that 20 repeat animals would be a useful number to show surgical 
efficiency and complications and that there would still be 10 animals in each test 
group for patch with RPE and membrane without cells.  This was agreed with the 
regulators before the GLP study was carried out, as a reasonable number to 
answer the surgical feasibility and complications questions.  In terms of 
biodistibution there were 10 animals and multiple sections from each organ 
providing a sufficient sample to answer the question of biodistribution.  Once again 
this was agreed prior to the experiment with the regulators.

3.   Replication
Describe whether the experimental findings were 
reliably reproduced.
This is a first in man first described study.  There was no replication study in our 
research design for the clinical study. The trial is planned for a total of 10 patients 
as described in point 1. above.  
 
In the mice study the demonstration of teratomas with native hESC was shown in 
three separate studies and in a total of 158 injected animals - 41 animals 
developed teratomas. 
The abscence of teratomas in hESC-RPE injected animals was demonstrated in 80  
injected animals.  Based on the undifferentiated hESC experiments with 41 
terratomas from 158 animals we felt that the use of 80 animals for the hESC-RPE 
experiment was likely show a teratoma if this was a posibility.  The hESC- RPE 
experiment was only completed as a single experiment with 80 repeats.
4.   Randomization
Describe how samples/organisms/participants were 
allocated into experimental groups.
There was no randomization in the primary clinical study 
 
In the mice experiments there was no randomization due to the large numbers 
injected.  The CRO presented the animals to the surgeons who carried out the 
procedure knowing the test cell type or solution.  The results were analysed 
independently of the surgeons and the researchers. 
 
In the GLP (second) pig study there was randomization of which animal received  
patches with RPE and those without.  The surgeon was informed of which patch 
was to be implanted at the commencement of each surgery.   
 
 
 
 
5.   Blinding
Describe whether the investigators were blinded to 
group allocation during data collection and/or analysis.
There was blinding in the assessment of labeled photo-receptor uptake in the 
phagocystosis assay as described in the on-line methods:  " To quantify 
phagocytosis, 3 distinct areas per patch of hESC-RPE or hESC-RPE with blocker 
(MERTK antibody) (n=3) were imaged blind on the Zeiss 710 confocal. The total 
number of internalized fluorescent POS were then counted in a 135μm x 135μm 
area, using the orthogonal view function. 
Note: all studies involving animals and/or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used.
6.   Statistical parameters 
For all figures and tables that use statistical methods, confirm that the following items are present in relevant figure legends (or in the 
Methods section if additional space is needed).

CFlow Plus software allows you to control the Accuri Flow Cytometer 
system to acquire data, generate statistics, and analyze results.
8.   Describe the abundance of the relevant cell 
populations within post-sort fractions.
To determine if any pluripotent cells were detectable in SHEF1.3 hESC-
derived RPE, flow cytometry was performed for TRA-1-60.  Quantification 
of TRA-1-60 showed only background levels of events in P0 and P1 RPE 
(0.3%). We also evaluated expression of TRA-1-81 (another widely used 
marker of pluripotent stem cells) in P1 RPE, showing that TRA-1-81 
expression is equivalent to the isotype control (negative; supplementary 
figure 2).  Therefore we conclude that neither RPE foci (P0) nor expanded 
RPE (P1) contain detectable levels of SHEF1.3 hESC. 
 
Flow cytometry for PI staining showed that 96% of these cells were dead 
on days 2 and 4 post seeding (combining both adherent cells and those in 
the media). 
9.   Describe the gating strategy used.
Presence of immuno tagged fluorophores were used to determine gates.
 Tick this box to confirm that a figure exemplifying the gating strategy is provided in the Supplementary Information.
