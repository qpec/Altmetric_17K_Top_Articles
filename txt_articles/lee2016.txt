IMPORTANCE Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major burden in health care and
community settings. CDI recurrence is of particular concern because of limited treatment
options and associated clinical and infection control issues. Fecal microbiota transplantation
(FMT) is a promising, but not readily available, intervention.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether frozen-and-thawed (frozen, experimental) FMT is
noninferior to fresh (standard) FMT in terms of clinical efficacy among patients with recurrent
or refractory CDI and to assess the safety of both types of FMT.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial enrolling
232 adults with recurrent or refractory CDI, conducted between July 2012 and September
2014 at 6 academic medical centers in Canada.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly allocated to receive frozen (n = 114) or fresh
(n = 118) FMT via enema.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome measures were clinical resolution
of diarrhea without relapse at 13 weeks and adverse events. Noninferiority margin
was set at 15%.
RESULTS A total of 219 patients (n = 108 in the frozen FMT group and n = 111 in the fresh FMT
group) were included in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population and 178 (frozen
FMT: n = 91, fresh FMT: n = 87) in the per-protocol population. In the per-protocol
population, the proportion of patients with clinical resolution was 83.5% for the frozen FMT
group and 85.1% for the fresh FMT group (difference, −1.6% [95% CI, –10.5% to �]; P = .01 for
noninferiority). In the mITT population the clinical resolution was 75.0% for the frozen FMT
group and 70.3% for the fresh FMT group (difference, 4.7% [95% CI, –5.2% to �]; P < .001 for
noninferiority). There were no differences in the proportion of adverse or serious adverse
events between the treatment groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with recurrent or refractory CDI, the use of
frozen compared with fresh FMT did not result in worse proportion of clinical resolution of
diarrhea. Given the potential advantages of providing frozen FMT, its use is a reasonable
option in this setting.

C
lostridium difficile infection (CDI), in health care set-
tings and in the community, has become a major clini-
cal and economic concern.1-3 Increases in failure rates
with conventional treatment, and recurrences following ini-
tial cure, present significant challenges to health care sys-
tems: more than 60% of patients experience further episodes
after a first recurrence.3 Treatment options for recurrent CDI
are limited, because metronidazole and vancomycin exhibit
suboptimal efficacy in this setting. A number of potential
approaches have been studied, which include tapered or
pulsed regimens of oral vancomycin4 and administration of
spores of nontoxigenic C difficile.5 In addition, adjunctive
vaccine or monoclonal antibodies against C difficile toxins are
currently in development.6,7
Molecular typing studies have demonstrated that 10%
to 50% of recurrent CDI cases may be attributable to re-
infections rather than recurrence of the initial infection,
suggesting that perturbed microbiota may play a role in
facilitating reinfection.8,9 Restoration of protective colonic
microbiota by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has
shown promising results: there is evidence that FMT
is an effective treatment for recurrent CDI.10,11 High cure
rates have been achieved with FMT given by enema, an
administration method that is much more convenient than
alternative reported methods, such as nasogastric tube or
colonoscopy.12 However, the usefulness of this approach
may be limited by logistic difficulties in preparing fresh
material. By contrast, the use of frozen-and-thawed (frozen)
FMT offers a number of advantages: less cost with reduction
in number and frequency of donor screenings; immediate
availability of FMT; and the possibility of delivering FMT at
centers that do not have on-site laboratory facilities. Previ-
ous studies have supported the use of frozen FMT for man-
agement of recurrent CDI but have not directly compared
frozen with fresh FMT.13-15 Hence, we performed a double-
blind randomized clinical trial to determine whether frozen
FMT is noninferior to fresh FMT for patients with recurrent
or refractory CDI.
Methods
Study Population
Patients 18 years or older with a history of recurrent or
refractory CDI were enrolled in the study. CDI was defined
by a positive result for C difficile toxins by enzyme immuno-
assay or by polymerase chain reaction targeting the C difficile
toxin B gene (tcdB) and 3 or more unformed stools within 24
hours, for a minimum of 48 hours. Sixty-nine isolates were
typed for presence of binary toxin, as previously described.16
Recurrent CDI was defined as recurrence of CDI symptoms
for 48 hours or longer within 8 weeks after the completion of
at least 10 days of CDI treatment. Refractory CDI was defined
as persistent or worsening of diarrhea characteristic of CDI
and 1 of the following: ongoing abdominal pain, fever (tem-
perature >38.0°C), or peripheral white blood cell (WBC)
counts greater than 15.0 × 109/L despite treatment with oral
vancomycin at a dose of 500 mg 4 times daily for at least 5
days. Patients with only a single recurrence of CDI were not
included unless the most recent episode became refractory
to treatment.
Keyexclusioncriteriaincludedneutropenia(<0.5 × 109/L),
peripheral WBC counts greater than 30.0 × 109/L, or toxic
megacolon (defined as radiographic evidence, combined with
fever >38°C, systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg, peripheral
WBCcount>15.0 × 109/L,orheartrate>120/min).Patientswho
remained symptom-free for 3 or more weeks after the comple-
tion of the CDI treatment were considered cured and were not
enrolled in the study.
Donor volunteers were prospectively screened and
rescreened every 6 months according to recommendations
by Bakken et al17; the majority of stools were obtained from
3 donors. Health Canada and the institutional research eth-
ics boards at each participating center approved the study
protocol (study protocol and study procedures are available
in Supplement 1), and all patients provided written
informed consent. A data and safety monitoring board
monitored the trial.
Study Design and Treatment
This was a randomized, double-blind, noninferiority clinical
trial, conducted between July 2012 and September 2014 at 6
academic medical centers in Canada. Patients were assigned
(1:1) to frozen or fresh FMT delivered by enema according to
a computer-generated random number; randomization was
performed in blocks (eAppendix in Supplement 2), with
stratification according to major risk factors for recurrent
CDI9,18,19: age (≥65 vs <65 years), setting (community- vs
health care–associated CDI), and the number of recurrent
CDI episodes (≥2 vs <2).
An unblinded laboratory technician prepared the first 2
enemas according to the assigned allocation. In situations in
which a related donor’
s sample was used, the eligible rela-
tive donor collected the stool and submitted the stool at
least 48 hours prior to the FMT to allow freezing and also in
the morning of the scheduled FMT to the laboratory to
ensure that the participant received the allocated FMT and
the designated donor’
s stool. This also ensured the mainte-
nance of blinding of the patient and the investigator.
All patients received suppressive antibiotics for their most
recent episode of CDI, which were discontinued 24 to 48 hours
prior to FMT. On day 1, patients received 50 mL of frozen or
fresh FMT by enema. Patients who showed no improvement
of CDI symptoms by day 4 received an additional FMT with the
same donor and allocation as the original FMT between days
5 and 8. Patients not responding to 2 FMTs were offered re-
peat FMT or antibiotic therapy. No bowel preparation was per-
formed prior to FMT because lavage is uncomfortable for the
patient, and there was no published evidence that it im-
proved the outcome of FMT.
FMT Preparation
Fresh stool samples from healthy donors were transported
to the processing laboratories within 5 hours of collection
and stored at 5°C until frozen or used for FMT. Approxi-
mately 100 g of stool sample was diluted with 300 mL of

commercially bottled water and emulsified using a sterile
wooden spatula. Gauze was placed on top of an empty con-
tainer to strain the solids, and the suspension in the con-
tainer was aspirated into 60-mL syringes, which were also
used to administer the enemas. Patients randomized to
receive fresh FMT received the suspension within 24 hours
of collection; those randomized to receive the frozen FMT
received the suspension within 24 hours of thawing. Frozen
suspensions were kept at −20°C for a maximum of 30 days
and thawed overnight at 25°C; anaerobic bacteria counts
have been found to remain stable for at least 30 days when
stored at −20°C.20
Study End Points
The primary end points were no recurrence of CDI-related
diarrhea at 13 weeks after receiving up to 2 FMTs without
the need for antibiotics specifically for recurrence and
safety. Safety was assessed by monitoring of adverse events
at the time of FMT and up to 13 weeks after the last FMT.
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were defined as death, a life-
threatening event, new hospitalization or prolongation of
current hospitalization, or development of a new significant
incapacity to conduct regular daily activities.
Secondary end points included treatment failure rates
in each group and assessment of the functional health and
well-being of patients prior to and up to 1 year after FMT as
measured by standardized questionnaire (RAND 36-Item
Health Survey).21 Treatment failure was defined as persis-
tence of diarrhea and a positive C difficile toxin assay or
tcdB polymerase chain reaction assay within 5 days of the
last FMT or the need for additional therapy for CDI; colec-
tomy; or death directly attributable to CDI at 13 weeks after
the last FMT.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed in both the per-protocol
and modified intention-to-treat (mITT) populations. The
per-protocol population comprised patients who received
up to 2 same-modality FMTs, did not require antibiotic
for CDI between the first 2 FMTs, and did not receive sys-
temic antibiotic for intercurrent infection during the study
period. The mITT population comprised all randomized
patients who received at least 1 FMT but required antibiotic
for CDI between the FMTs or who received a type of FMT
different from the first FMT, who were lost to follow-up,
or who required systemic antibiotic therapy for other
infections.
The study was designed as a noninferiority trial, with
5% level of significance and 80% power. Both the per-
protocol and the mITT analyses were conducted according
to the methods of Kaji and Lewis.22 Noninferiority was con-
firmed if the lower limit of the 1-sided 95% CI for the
between-group difference in the primary end point was not
lower than −15%. Based on the literature review and previ-

ous experience, the efficacy of fresh FMT was determined
to be 85% for recurrent CDI. The 15% margin difference
between the treatment groups was established by the inves-
tigators’judgment of the advantages of frozen FMT com-
pared with fresh FMT. This was set a priori and was based
on the principles described by Schumi and Wittes23 and the
noninferiority trial guideline issued by the US Food and
Drug Administration.24
A sample size of 156 (78 in each group) was calculated
based on the assumed 85% efficacy of FMT12,13 and the attri-
tion rate of 10%. Between-group comparisons were per-
formed using Fisher exact test, proportional test, t test, and
Wilcoxon test. All analyses were performed using R version
3.1.1 software.
Results
Patients
A total of 232 patients were enrolled and randomized to re-
ceive fresh (n = 118) or frozen (n = 114) FMT. The numbers of
patients included in the mITT and per-protocol populations
are shown in the Figure.
Patients’demographics and clinical data are summa-
rized in Table 1. There were no differences between the 2
treatment groups with respect to the baseline characteristics
or the severity of CDI as defined by Zar et al.25 Despite the
fact that all patients had received antibiotics to control their
most recent episode of CDI, stool samples from 87 patients

tested positive for C difficile toxin or tcdB at the time of FMT,
as did the stool samples collected at the time of CDI relapse
after FMT. The median duration of CDI from the initial diag-
nosis of CDI that led to the first FMT was 85 days (range,
6-1351 days) in the mITT population and 91 days (range,
14-870 days) in the per-protocol population. The median
duration of antibiotic usage for CDI treatment prior to the
first FMT was 48 days (range, 6-811 days) in the mITT popu-
lation and 52 days (range, 11-811 days) in the per-protocol
population. (The wide ranges associated with these medians
were attributable to the fact that the study included both
refractory and recurrent cases.)
Efficacy
The per-protocol population comprised 91 patients in the
frozen FMT group and 87 in the fresh FMT group. The mITT
population comprised 108 patients in the frozen FMT group
and 111 in the fresh FMT group. The response rates following
FMTs are shown in Table 2 and in eTable 1 in Supplement 2.
The proportions of primary clinical resolution in the per-
protocol population were 76 of 91 (83.5%) in the frozen FMT
group and 74 of 87 (85.1%) in the fresh FMT group (differ-
ence, −1.6% [95% 1-sided CI, −10.5% to �]; P = .01 for nonin-
feriority). In the mITT population, the corresponding pro-
portions were 81 of 108 (75.0%) in the frozen FMT group and
78 of 111 (70.3%) in the fresh FMT group, after up to 2 FMTs
(difference, 4.7% [95% 1-sided CI, −5.2% to �]; P < .001 for
noninferiority). Since the lower confidence limits were
above the noninferiority margin of −15% in both popula-
tions, frozen FMT was determined to be noninferior to fresh
FMT. The proportions of response after each FMT are shown
in Table 2. Whenever patients received CDI antibiotic in
between FMTs or were lost to follow-up, they were consid-
ered as having experienced treatment failure and placed in
the mITT population; therefore, the proportions of response
in the mITT groups were lower than in the per-protocol
population. Differences between the 2 treatment groups in
primary cure rates in patient subgroups are reported in
Table 3.
Six patients who did not respond to multiple FMTs re-
mained symptom-free while receiving once-daily oral vanco-
mycin at 12 to 18 months; 4 of these patients were refractory
to vancomycin prior to FMT. The patients who did not re-
spond after up to 2 FMTs were deemed to have experienced
treatment failure with regard to the primary end point.
Safety
There were no observed differences in the proportion of
adverse events or SAEs between the 2 treatment groups. The
most common adverse events considered at least possibly
related to FMT were transient diarrhea (70%), abdominal
cramps (10%), or nausea (<5%) during the 24 hours follow-
ing an FMT and constipation (20%) and excess flatulence
(25%) during the follow-up period. All were mild to moder-
ate. Other adverse events observed were urinary tract infec-
tions, which occurred several weeks after FMT in patients
with a previous history of recurrent urinary tract infections
(<5%), respiratory tract infection, blood in stool, and exacer-
bation of preexisting rheumatoid arthritis after discontinua-
tion of immunosuppressants (all <1%). These episodes were
assessed by blinded investigators and deemed unlikely to be
related to FMT. The patients who developed urinary tract
and respiratory tract infections received antibiotics for these
infections but did not develop subsequent CDI.
There were 29 SAEs during the 13-week follow-up period
from the last FMT. Twelve patients (8 in the frozen FMT group
and 4 in the fresh FMT group) required hospitalization be-
cause of illnesses unrelated to FMT following clinical resolu-
tion of CDI after FMT. A total of 19 patients (6 in the frozen FMT
group and 13 in the fresh FMT group) died during the 13-week
study period; none of these deaths were considered directly
attributable to FMT (Table 4; eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Four
patients (2 in the frozen FMT group and 2 in the fresh FMT
group) died with unresolved CDI: of these, 1 had received 3
FMTs, 2 had received 2 FMTs, and the other had received a
single FMT.
Discussion
In this clinical trial, the use of frozen FMT compared with
fresh FMT for the treatment of recurrent or refractory CDI
was noninferior in terms of efficacy; findings for frozen
FMT and fresh FMT were similar in terms of safety. The pro-
portion of clinical resolution with up to 2 FMTs in this study
is similar to proportions achieved with FMTs (70%-91%) in
previous FMT trials.10,14 Although some systematic
reviews11;have reported higher cure rates, it should be noted
that the data included in these reviews were derived from
uncontrolled, retrospective case reports and case series, and
that there was substantial variability in the patient popula-
tions studied and the delivery of FMT. A recently published
study of oral administration of capsules containing frozen
FMT achieved clinical resolution of 70% following the pri-
mary treatment and greater than 90% with subsequent
treatments, demonstrating that frozen FMT is safe and
effective when administered orally.14,15 We chose to use
retention enemas in this study because a previous study
indicated that FMT delivered by enema was safe and
effective.12,26
In this study, as in others,10,13,14,27,28 there was evidence
that the proportion of clinical resolution increased with the

number of FMTs. The primary end point was the rate of clini-
cal resolution achieved with up to 2 FMTs; the aim of the study
was to compare the efficacy of frozen and fresh FMTs, rather
than to assess the efficacy of repeated FMTs.
Patients in this study had an extensive burden of morbid-
ity: 111 of 218 (51%) were inpatients at the time of FMT, 145 of
219 (66%) had moderate to severe CDI, 29 of 69 (42%) were
infected with 027 ribotype strain, and 24 were immunocom-
promised. Nevertheless, the proportions of clinical resolu-
tion after receipt of up to 2 FMTs were high (27/29 [93%] for
immunocompromised patients and 5/6 [83%] for patients with
inflammatory bowel disease). Furthermore, the number of ad-
verse events in all subgroups was low, similar to previous
studies.12-15
A total of 19 patients (8.7%) (6 in the frozen FMT group and
13 in the fresh FMT group) died during the follow-up period,
of whom 4 (1.8%) died with unresolved CDI. None of these
deaths were considered directly related to FMT. A systematic
review reported an all-cause 30-day mortality rate among pa-
tients with CDI of 15% or greater and 30-day CDI-attributable
mortality of 5.7% to 6.9%.29
The FMT preparation technique used in this study con-
fers a number of advantages. First, the stool preparation pro-
tocol uses disposable equipment and does not require spe-
cialized, costly devices. Second, administration by enema is
significantly less invasive than colonoscopy or nasojejunal/
gastric administration and can be performed outside an
acute care facility. Third, frozen FMT reduces the number
and frequency of donor screenings compared with fresh
FMT, potentially reducing the costs. This approach also has
the added value of wide applicability in diverse health care
settings. Last, concern about potential transmission of
pathogens from the donor to the recipient with fresh FMT
can be ameliorated by quarantining (and freezing) the col-
lected stool sample until screening results are available.
This study has several limitations. First, the follow-up
was limited to 13 weeks after the last FMT, which is insuffi-
cient to evaluate the long-term safety of the treatment.
However, this time frame was longer than the majority of
CDI therapeutic trials, which have followed up patients for
up to 40 days. Second, this study showed a lower propor-
tion of clinical response in the per-protocol population fol-
lowing a single FMT (62%) than a previous study and the
published case series, in which the cumulative cure rate was
greater than 90%.10-15,26-28 Although this raises the possibil-
ity that small-volume enemas may be slightly less effective
than other delivery methods, a direct comparative trial is
needed to examine this. It is also likely that the larger
sample size of the study, and its prospective, randomized
design, allowed more sensitive detection of clinical failures;
in addition, 51% of the patients were hospitalized at the
time of FMT. The low number of stool donors may also be
considered a study limitation; however, the aim was to com-
pare fresh and frozen FMTs, rather than potential donor
effects. Although it would have been useful to determine
the efficacy of FMT according to the total number of recur-
rences, this was not feasible because of the prolonged dura-
tion of recurrence and the history of multiple recurrences in
the majority of patients.
There is a need to determine the long-term safety of FMT.
Extended (10-year) follow-up of the patients in this trial is un-
der way to investigate the long-term positive (eg, improve-
ment of the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, autoimmune dis-
ease)ornegative(eg,developmentofmetabolicorautoimmune
diseases, cancer) outcomes.
Conclusions
Among adults with recurrent or refractory CDI, the use of fro-
zen compared with fresh FMT did not result in worse propor-
tion of clinical resolution of diarrhea. Given the potential ad-
vantagesofprovidingfrozenFMT,itsuseisareasonableoption
in this setting.
