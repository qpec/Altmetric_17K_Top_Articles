Chronic liver disease is rising in western countries and liver cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause
of death worldwide. Simultaneously, use of gastric acid suppressive medications is increasing.
Here, we show that proton pump inhibitors promote progression of alcoholic liver
disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice by
increasing numbers of intestinal Enterococcus spp. Translocating enterococci lead to hepatic
inflammation and hepatocyte death. Expansion of intestinal Enterococcus faecalis is sufficient
to exacerbate ethanol-induced liver disease in mice. Proton pump inhibitor use increases the
risk of developing alcoholic liver disease among alcohol-dependent patients. Reduction of
gastric acid secretion therefore appears to promote overgrowth of intestinal Enterococcus,
which promotes liver disease, based on data from mouse models and humans. Recent
increases in the use of gastric acid-suppressive medications might contribute to the
increasing incidence of chronic liver disease.

 T
he number of people with chronic liver disease is
increasing rapidly in western countries. Liver cirrhosis as
end-stage organ disease is now the 12th leading cause of
death worldwide1. The increase is partly due to the increasing
prevalence of obesity, which is associated with non-alcoholic
fatty
liver
disease
(NAFLD)
and
steatohepatitis
(NASH)2.
Approximately 50% of all cirrhosis-associated deaths are related
to alcohol3.
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which reduce gastric acid
secretion, are among the most commonly prescribed medications
in the world. There has been a substantial growth in the total PPI
use, and approximately 6–15% of the general population is
receiving
acid
suppression
therapy4,
5;
32%
of
patients
with NAFLD6 and 67–72% of patients with cirrhosis take
acid-reducing
medications7,
8.
Gastric
acid
kills
ingested
microbes, and suppression of gastric acid secretion can change
the composition of the intestinal microbiota9.
We investigated the effects of gastric acid suppression on
progression of chronic liver disease. Here we report that
gastric
acid
suppression
induces
overgrowth
of
intestinal
Enterococcus and its translocation to the liver. In the liver, hepatic
macrophages and Kupffer cells recognize Enterococcus and
induce interleukin-1 beta (IL1B) secretion contributing to
ethanol-induced liver inflammation and hepatocyte damage.
We provide evidence from mice and humans that gastric acid
suppression promotes liver injury and progression of chronic
liver disease.
Results
Absence of gastric acid exacerbates alcohol-induced liver dis-
ease.
We
first
determined
the
role
of
gastric
acid
on
ethanol-induced liver disease in Atp4aSl/Sl mice, which have a
point mutation in Atp4a (the gene encoding the gastric H+, K+
-ATPase α subunit) and develop achlorhydria (absent gastric
acid)10. Atp4aSl/Sl mice developed more severe ethanol-associated
liver disease than littermates with wild-type Atp4a (WT).
Following ethanol administration, the Atp4aSl/Sl mice showed
more severe liver injury, based on level of alanine amino-
transferase (ALT) and hepatic steatosis, than WT mice (Fig. 1a–c
and Supplementary Fig. 1a–c).
In Atp4aSl/Sl mice, liver disease progressed from simple
steatosis to steatohepatitis. Inflammation was identified based
on the hepatic increase in levels of the macrophage marker F4/80
(indicating more inflammatory Kupffer cells; Supplementary
Fig. 1d, e), de novo expression of the Ccl2 and Cxcl5 genes, which
encode inflammatory chemokines (Supplementary Fig. 1f), and
higher levels of active (cleaved) IL1B protein (Fig. 1d and
Supplementary Fig. 1g). In addition, livers from ethanol-fed
Atp4aSl/Sl mice became fibrotic (Fig. 1e, f) and had increased
staining for smooth muscle α-actin (ACTA2), a marker of
activated myofibroblasts and stellate cells, which contribute to the
development of fibrosis (Supplementary Fig. 1h, i). Absence of
gastric acid (due to the mutation in Atp4a in mice) did not
affect intestinal absorption or hepatic metabolism of ethanol
(Supplementary Fig. 1j, k).
Chronic administration of ethanol is associated with intestinal
bacterial overgrowth and dysbiosis11. To determine whether the
absence of gastric acid altered the composition of the intestinal
microbiota, luminal bacteria were measured by quantitative PCR
(qPCR), and changes in the microbiota were analyzed by 16S
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing. Ethanol administration
resulted in intestinal bacterial overgrowth and dysbiosis in both
strains of mice, but levels of these were increased to a significantly
greater extent in Atp4aSl/Sl mice than in WT mice (Fig. 1g). One
of the most prominent changes identified by 16S rRNA
sequencing was an increased proportion of Enterococcus spp.
(Gram-positive cocci) in the microbiota of Atp4aSl/Sl mice
compared with WT mice after ethanol feeding (Supplementary
Fig. 2a), which was confirmed by qPCR (Fig. 1g). We measured
proportions of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Prevotella spp.
(both Gram-negative rods) as controls. The proportion of E. coli
increased by a non-significant amount in Atp4aSl/Sl mice fed
ethanol compared to WT mice fed ethanol. On the other
hand, the proportion of Prevotella was significantly reduced in
Atp4aSl/SI mice fed ethanol compared with WT mice fed ethanol
(Supplementary Fig. 2a).
Development
of
alcoholic
liver
disease
(ALD)
involves
increased translocation of microbial products from the intestinal
lumen
to
the
liver,
facilitated
by
disruption
of
the
intestinal epithelial barrier12. Following ethanol administration,
paracellular intestinal permeability (as quantified by detection
of albumin in the feces) and plasma level of endotoxin
(lipopolysaccharide, LPS) increased to similar levels in WT and
Atp4aSl/Sl mice (Supplementary Fig. 2b). To relate changes in
the microbiome to translocation, enterococci were measured in
extra-intestinal tissues. Numbers of gut-derived and translocated
Enterococcus were significantly higher in mesenteric lymph nodes
and liver tissues of Atp4aSl/Sl than WT mice following chronic
ethanol administration as measured by qPCR (Fig. 1h). There was
no significant difference in the amount of E. coli and Prevotella
translocated to mesenteric lymph nodes and liver between
Atp4aSl/Sl and WT mice following chronic ethanol administration
(Supplementary Fig. 2c). A significantly higher proportion of
bacterial cultures from liver tissues of Atp4aSl/Sl mice given
ethanol were positive for Enterococcus than from WT mice
given ethanol in a second model of alcoholic liver disease (Fig. 1i).
Atp4aSl/Sl
mice
were
confirmed
to
have
more
severe
ethanol-associated
liver
disease
in
this
chronic-plus-binge
model13 (Supplementary Fig. 3a–f), consistent with the chronic
Lieber DeCarli model. These results indicate that ethanol feeding
promotes specific expansion of intestinal Enterococcus and its
translocation to the liver in the absence of gastric acid.
NAFLD is increased in the absence of gastric acid secretion.
We extended our study to mice with metabolic liver diseases.
A high-fat diet (HFD) induces NAFLD in mice. Atp4aSl/Sl mice
fed a HFD for 9 weeks did not differ from WT mice fed a HFD in
body weight or weight of white adipose tissue (Fig. 2a).
However, hepatic steatosis was more severe (Fig. 2b, c) and
insulin sensitivity was reduced in Atp4aSl/Sl mice on a HFD
compared to WT mice on a HFD (Fig. 2d). A higher number of
liver macrophages and increased levels of active IL1B were
observed in Atp4aSl/Sl mice on a HFD (Fig. 2e–g). Hepatic
expression of the Col1a1 gene was induced in Atp4aSl/Sl mice on a
HFD, compared with WT mice on a HFD (Fig. 2h). Similar to the
ethanol-induced liver disease, there was a strong increase in
bacterial overgrowth and the proportion of Enterococcus in the
microbiota of Atp4aSl/Sl mice fed a HFD, compared with WT
mice fed a HFD (Fig. 2i).
Absence of gastric acid secretion exacerbates NASH. Mice were
fed a choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet for
20
weeks
to
induce
histologic
changes
that
resemble
those observed in patients with NASH. Absence of gastric acid
exacerbated NASH (Atp4aSl/Sl vs. WT mice), demonstrated by
increased liver to body weight ratio (Fig. 3a), levels of ALT
(Fig. 3b), steatosis (Fig. 3c–e), inflammation (Fig. 3f, g), and
fibrosis (Fig. 3h–j). Total numbers of intestinal bacteria and
numbers of Enterococcus were significantly higher in Atp4aSl/Sl
mice than WT mice, with and without the CDAA diet (Fig. 3k).

 Taken together, disruption of Atp4a, which controls gastric acid
secretion, increases the severity of alcohol-induced liver disease,
NAFLD, and NASH in mice.
PPIs promote progression of ethanol-induced steatohepatitis.
We performed pharmacologic studies with PPIs (omeprazole) to
confirm our findings from the genetic model of achlorhydria.
Mice were given doses of PPI similar to those of previous
studies14, which increased gastric pH to that of the Atp4aSl/Sl
mice10 (Supplementary Fig. 4a). This PPI dose was higher than
that usually given to patients, because the PPI administered to
mice lacks enteric coating and undergoes rapid degradation in the
stomach15.
Consistent
with
our
data
from
Atp4aSl/Sl
mice, C57BL/6 mice receiving a PPI developed more severe
ethanol-induced liver injury, steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis
than mice not receiving a PPI (Fig. 4a–f and Supplementary
Fig. 4b–j). The PPI did not affect absorption or hepatic meta-
bolism of ethanol (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b).
PPI administration was associated with significant increases in
numbers of fecal bacteria and Enterococcus following ethanol
administration (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 5c). Suppression
of gastric acid resulted in differences of the spatial distribution
of
intestinal
enterococci—significantly
higher
numbers
of
Enterococcus associated with the mucosa of the small intestine
following
ethanol
administration
(Supplementary
Fig.
5d).
Impaired control of the mucosa-associated microbiota leads to
increased bacterial translocation and facilitates progression of
alcoholic
liver
disease16.
Translocation
of
Enterococcus
to
mesenteric lymph nodes and the liver was increased in ethanol-
fed mice also given a PPI, compared with those that did not
receive a PPI (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 5e).
Dynamics of intestinal Enterococcus growth. We used an in vivo
assay to measure killing of bioluminescent bacteria in ligated
jejunal loops17. A larger number of Enterococcus
faecalis
(E. faecalis) survived and proliferated in the jejunum in the
absence of gastric acid (Atp4aSl/Sl mice) than in WT mice; this
difference was not observed for E. coli (controls; Fig. 5a, b). This
result indicates that E. faecalis favors a less acidic environment,
compared to E. coli, during ethanol feeding. The increase in
intestinal Enterococcus after increases in gastric pH is rapid and
reversible—numbers of enterococci decreased back to baseline
levels after PPIs were withdrawn for 3 weeks. In contrast, the total
numbers of intestinal bacteria remained elevated, due to the
continual presence of ethanol (Fig. 5c).
To extend our preclinical findings to humans, enterococci were
measured in fecal samples collected from healthy individuals
before
and
after
PPI
(omeprazole)
therapy.
Numbers
of
Enterococcus significantly increased in samples collected after
2 weeks of PPI treatment vs. before (Fig. 6a).
E. faecalis enhances ethanol-induced liver disease. We then
tested whether overgrowth of intestinal Enterococcus is sufficient
to increase alcohol-induced liver disease. We have recently shown
that a complete absence of the microbiota exacerbates acute
ethanol-induced liver disease in germ-free mice. At baseline,
germ-free mice have an altered xenobiotic response to drugs and
increased hepatic ethanol metabolism18. Gnotobiotic mice are
therefore not an ideal disease model to manipulate the intestinal
microbiota during ethanol-induced liver disease. To mimic longer
lasting overgrowth of intestinal enterococci following gastric acid
suppression, overgrowth was induced by repeated gavage of
C57BL/6 mice with E. faecalis, which was isolated from feces of
an ethanol-fed Atp4aSl/Sl mouse. E. faecalis was selected, because
it was among the three most abundant Enterococcus spp. in
intestines of ethanol-fed Atp4aSl/Sl mice, as identified by 16S
rRNA sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 2a).
Numbers
of
Enterococcus
in
feces
from
gavaged
and
ethanol-fed mice increased significantly, similar to the increase
observed after genetic or pharmacologic reduction of gastric acid
(Fig. 6b). Colonization of mice with E. faecalis did not affect the
total number of bacteria following chronic ethanol administration
(Fig.
6b).
Therefore,
experimental
expansion
of
intestinal
E. faecalis during alcohol feeding mimics alcohol-induced
alterations of the microbiota in mice with suppressed gastric
acid secretion, and represents a good model to study the role of
E. faecalis for ethanol-induced liver disease. Increasing intestinal
numbers of E. faecalis led to translocation of enterococci
and
exacerbated
ethanol-induced
liver
injury,
steatosis,
inflammation, and fibrosis in mice. Mild liver disease was
induced by E. faecalis in control mice that did not receive
ethanol (Fig. 6c–i and Supplementary Fig. 6a–j). These findings
indicate that Enterococcus promotes progression of chronic liver
disease in mice.
Mechanism of E. faecalis -exacerbated alcoholic liver disease.
To further define the mechanism by which Enterococcus increases
liver disease, we generated Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), or myeloid
differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88)/TIR-domain-con-
taining adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF; also known as
TICAM1) bone-marrow chimeric mice using a combination of
clodronate-mediated Kupffer cell depletion, irradiation, and
bone-marrow transplantation. WT mice were given bone marrow
transplants from WT, Tlr2−/−, or Myd88−/−/TrifLPS2/LPS2 mice,
which results in full reconstitution of Kupffer cells19, 20.
TLR2 is a cell membrane receptor that recognizes products
from Gram-positive bacteria such as peptidoglycan21. MYD88
and TRIF are intracellular adaptor molecules for pathogen
recognition receptors such as TLRs; mice that do not express
MYD88 and TRIF lack innate immune signaling22, 23. Chimeric
mice with Kupffer cells that do not express MYD88/TRIF or
TLR2 were protected from E. faecalis -exacerbated alcoholic liver
injury (Fig. 7a, b), steatosis (Fig. 7c, d), inflammation (Fig. 7e),
and fibrosis (Fig. 7f, g), compared with chimeric mice with WT
Kupffer cells. Intestinal absorption or hepatic metabolism of
ethanol was not affected in chimeric mice (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b).
Interestingly, despite being protected from E. faecalis -exacer-
bated alcoholic liver disease, chimeric mice with Kupffer cells that
did
not
express
MYD88/TRIF
had
a
significantly
higher
percentage of positive Enterococcus blood cultures than mice
with WT or Tlr2−/− Kupffer cells (Supplementary Fig. 7c). This
indicates that viable Enterococcus reaches the liver and mediates
ethanol-induced liver disease via binding to TLR2 on Kupffer
cells and induction of hepatic inflammation. Under normal
circumstances, viable bacteria are cleared efficiently by Kupffer
cells, which prevents prolonged exposure of microbes to pathogen
recognition receptors. Phagocytosis is impaired in the absence of
MYD88 and TRIF in Kupffer cells by mechanisms that deserve
future investigations.
IL1B mediates alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice24. Levels of
hepatic IL1B protein significantly increased after E. faecalis
expansion
and
administration
of
ethanol.
This
increase
was blocked in mice with Kupffer cells that did not express
MYD88/TRIF or TLR2 (Fig. 7e). Using immunofluorescence
analyses, we found that in livers of ethanol-fed mice, F4/80
co-localized with IL1B (Fig. 8a). We therefore isolated primary
Kupffer cells from WT and Tlr2−/− mice and stimulated with
inactivated E. faecalis. WT, but not Tlr2−/− Kupffer cells,
increased gene expression of inflammatory mediators, such as
Il1b, Cxcl1, and Ccl2 (Fig. 8b). Incubation of ethanol-primed

 mouse hepatocytes with conditioned medium from E. faecalis
-stimulated Kupffer cells increased hepatocyte cytotoxicity in the
presence of an isotype control antibody. This cytotoxic effect was
blocked with a neutralizing antibody against IL1B (Fig. 8c).
Cytotoxicity correlated with the secreted amount of total IL1B in
the supernatant (Fig. 8d).
These results indicate that translocated Enterococcus binds to
TLR2 on Kupffer cells to increase IL1B secretion and liver cell
damage. To further demonstrate that ILB, as downstream target
of TLR2, mediates E. faecalis -exacerbated alcoholic liver disease
in vivo, mice were treated with the ILB receptor antagonist
anakinra. Anakinra-treated mice were protected from E. faecalis
-exacerbated alcoholic liver disease (Fig. 7 and Supplementary
Fig. 7).
PPIs increase the risk of liver disease in chronic alcoholics.
We next examined the association between use of PPIs and
development of ALD among chronic alcohol abusers. Of 4830
patients with a diagnosis of chronic alcohol abuse, 1024 (21%)
were active users of PPIs, 745 (15%) were previous users, and
3061 (63%) had never used PPIs. The 3 groups were similar
with respect to demographics and liver-related biochemistry
at inclusion (Supplementary Table 1). The 10-year risk of a
diagnosis of ALD was 20.7% for active users of PPIs, 16.1% for
previous users, and 12.4% for never users (Fig. 9a). The active
users had a significantly higher risk of developing ALD than
previous users (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for active users vs.
previous users = 1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00–1.88) or
never-users (adjusted HR for active users vs. never users = 1.52;
95% CI, 1.21–1.91). We did not find any confounding variables
that could account for these associations. Finally, we observed
significantly greater numbers of Enterococcus in fecal samples
from patients who abuse alcohol and use PPI concomitantly than
patients who abuse alcohol and do not use PPIs (Fig. 9b).
Discussion
Changes in the gastrointestinal homeostasis can promote liver
disease25, 26. Our findings link an increase in Enterococcus with
induction of hepatic inflammation, via the pathogen-recognition
receptor TLR2, and progression of liver disease (Fig. 10). Vir-
ulence factors of Enterococcus, such as gelatinase E27, might
facilitate bacterial translocation and could also contribute to liver
disease. Enterococcus has also been found to cause spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis in patients with end-stage liver disease. In
patients
with
cirrhosis,
risk
of
bacterial
infections
and
their complications is strongly associated with acid suppressive
medication28. Hence, the side effects of gastric acid suppression
are not limited to development and progression of pre-cirrhotic
liver disease, but also include infections commonly observed in
patients with cirrhosis.
Importantly,
we
demonstrate
that
in
alcohol-dependent
patients, gastric acid suppression promotes the onset and
progression of liver disease. Although a randomized study is
required to confirm data from our cohort study, our findings
indicate that the recent rise in use of gastric acid-suppressing
medications might have contributed to the increased incidence of
chronic liver disease. In our cohort, 36% of alcohol-dependent
patients have been using PPIs. Although obesity and alcohol use
predispose to acid reflux requiring antacid medication, many
patients with chronic liver disease take gastric acid suppressive
medications without appropriate indication29. Clinicians should
consider withholding medications that suppress gastric acid
unless there is a strong medical indication.
Methods
Mice. Sublytic Atp4aSl/Sl mice generated on a hybrid background of 129/SvJ and
Black Swiss strains, and backcrossed to the C57BL/6 J background. Atp4aSl/Sl mice
were created by using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea to induce a causal mutation (T → C
transition) in Atp4a, encoding the α subunit of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase10.
Heterozygous Atp4a+/Sl mice on a C57BL/6 genetic background were used for
breeding, and mice with unmutated Atp4a (WT) and Atp4aSl/Sl littermates were
used in experiments. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River and used in
PPI, E. faecalis, and bone-marrow transplantation studies.
Female mice (age, 10 weeks) were used in Lieber DeCarli diet model
experiments for 9 weeks30. In brief, the Lieber DeCarli diet comprises Micro
Stabilized Rod Liq AC IRR (LD101A; TestDiet), Maltodextrin IRR (9598; TestDiet)
and 200-proof ethanol (Koptec). The caloric intake from ethanol was 0 on day 1,
10% of total calories on days 2 and 3, 20% on days 4 and 5, 30% from day 6 until
the end of 6 weeks, and 36% for the last 3 weeks. Control mice received an
isocaloric amount of iso-maltose instead of ethanol. For the chronic-plus-binge
ethanol feeding model13, age-matched female mice were fed the Lieber DeCarli diet
for 15 days followed by an ethanol binge. The caloric intake from ethanol was 0 on
days 1–5 and 36% from day 6 until the end. At day 16, mice were gavaged with a
single dose of ethanol (5 g kg−1 body weight) in the early morning and then
sacrificed 9 h later. Mice were pair-fed and the amount of liquid diet containing
ethanol was similar between mouse strains within each experiment (Supplementary
Fig. 8a–e).
To induce non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, male mice (age 10 weeks) were fed a
high-fat diet (HFD; 59% energy from fat; S3282; Bio-Serv) for 9 weeks. HFD intake
was not different between WT and Atp4aSl/Sl mice (Supplementary Fig. 8f). A
choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet (518753; Dyets) was given for
20 weeks to induce non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. A choline-supplemented L-amino
acid-defined (CSAA) diet (518754; Dyets) served as control diet. CDAA diet intake
did not differ between WT and Atp4aSl/Sl mice (Supplementary Fig. 8g).
Omeprazole (Fagron) was mixed, at indicated doses, into liquid diets. To reduce
intestinal bacteria, female C57BL/6 (Charles River) mice were gavaged with
polymyxin B (McKesson) 150 mg kg−1 and neomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) 200 mg kg−1
body weight once daily for 1 week. Following eradication of the commensal
microbiota, mice were gavaged with 5 × 109 CFUs E. faecalis (or water as control)
every third day. E. faecalis was isolated from an ethanol-fed Atp4aSl/Sl mouse. The
identity was confirmed by 16S rRNA PCR (see below) and sequence analyses.
E. faecalis was grown freshly in Bacto Brain-Heart infusion medium (Becton
Dickinson) for each gavage.
As described, Atp4aSl/Sl mice develop iron deficiency anemia at ages of
4–6 weeks. To replace iron, WT and Atp4aSl/Sl littermate mice were placed on a
high-iron diet (containing 2% carbonyl iron diet; 7012, Envigo) for 4 weeks10. Mice
were then maintained on a regular chow diet (RC; 5053; LabDiet) for 1 week before
experiments. Four weeks of iron supplementation reversed anemia and iron
deficiency for the length of all experimental procedures (9 weeks for alcohol-
induced liver disease, Supplementary Fig. 8h; 9 weeks for feeding of a HFD,
Supplementary Fig. 8j; 20 weeks for CDAA-induced steatohepatitis; Supplementary
Fig. 8k). Total plasma and liver levels of iron did not differ significantly between
ethanol-fed WT and Atp4aSl/Sl mice at the end of the treatment period
(Supplementary Fig. 8i).
For bone marrow transplantation, C57BL/6 recipient mice were given lethal
doses of radiation (650 rads) twice, using a 137Cs source. Two weeks after bone
marrow transplantation, mice were given intraperitoneal injections of 200 μl of
clodronate liposomes (5 mg ml−1; Vrije Universiteit, The Netherlands) to deplete
radio-resistant Kupffer cells. The Lieber DeCarli diet began 4 weeks after bone
marrow transplantation. C57BL/6 mice and mice deficient in MYD88 and TRIF
(Myd88−/−/TrifLPS2/LPS2)22, 23 or TLR2 (Jackson laboratory) on a C57BL/6 genetic
background were used as bone marrow donors.
To block IL1 signaling, mice were given intraperitoneal injections of anakinra
(Amgen; 25 mg kg−1 daily) for the last 5 weeks of the experiment.
All animal studies were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the University of California, San Diego.
Bacterial DNA isolation and 16S rRNA sequencing. DNA was isolated from
feces, liver, or mesenteric lymph nodes of mice. Samples were resuspended in
PBS and digested with RNAse A and proteinase K at 55 °C for one hour. Each
suspension was then transferred to individual Qbiogene lysing matrix B tubes and
vortexed using a FastPrep FP120 instrument. The lysate was then extracted twice
using Phenol/Chloroform/Isoamyl alcohol, precipitated and washed with ethanol,
and the DNA resuspended in TE buffer11, 31, 32. Genomic DNA was isolated from
the mucus layer from a 2 cm piece of the proximal small intestine (jejunum). The
exact length, width, and weight of this piece were measured. Luminal contents were
collected by flushing with 1 ml sterile PBS. The remaining intestine was cut
longitudinally and washed vigorously in 1 ml PBS to collect the mucus and its
associated bacteria16. We performed deep DNA pyrosequencing of fecal DNA
targeting the hypervariable V1–V3 region of prokaryotic 16S rRNA loci using 454
GS FLX Titanium technology to generate microbial community profiles using
species level (97% similarity) operational taxonomic unit-based classification and
analysis, as previously described11, 32. Sequence data were registered at NCBI under

Enterococcus cultures. Blood and liver were collected in a sterile fashion. Liver was
homogenized using a beads beater, and liquid enterococcus cultures were incubated
for 72 h at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions in a selective medium, BBL Enter-
ococosel broth (Becton Dickinson). Positive cultures were identified by the brown-
black color generated by the hydrolysis of esculin to esculetin that reacts with ferric
citrate.

 Real-time qPCR. RNA was extracted from mouse tissues and cDNAs were
generated20. Primer sequences for mouse genes were obtained from the NIH
qPrimerDepot. To quantify the total bacterial load present in feces, the qPCR value
of 16 S rRNA gene for each sample was multiplied by the total amount of DNA
(μg) per mg of feces. The following published bacterial primer sequences were used:
16 S rRNA gene33, Enterococcus34, E. coli35, and Prevotella36. The qPCR value of
bacteria was normalized to the total amount of 16S. To quantify enterococci in
mesenteric lymph nodes or liver, the qPCR value of Enterococcus for each sample
was multiplied by the total amount of DNA (μg) per mg of tissue. Genomic
bacterial DNA was extracted from the liver, and the qPCR value of bacteria was
normalized to the host 18S gene or total amount of DNA (μg) per mg of liver.
Mouse gene expression and amplification of genomic bacterial DNA were
determined with Sybr Green (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using the ABI StepOnePlus
real-time PCR system. All gene expression data were expressed relative to
control-fed WT mice.
In vivo luminal killing assay. Non-pathogenic E. coli were transformed with
the pXen13 plasmid (Caliper)—a vector carrying the original Photorhabdus
luminescens luxCDABE operon for engineering bioluminescent bacteria. This
operon is not expressed in Gram-positive bacteria. Therefore for expression in
E. faecalis (isolated from an ethanol-fed Atp4aSl/Sl mouse), pSL101P16s harboring
the luxABCDE cassette under the control of a synthetic E. faecalis 16S RNA P1
promoter37 (provided by Dag Anders Brede, Norwegian University of Life Sciences,
Ås, Norway) was used. To assess the killing and survival rate of non-pathogenic
and bioluminescent bacteria in vivo, we used an intestinal loop model17, 38.
After anesthesia, a midline laparotomy incision was made. A segment of the
jejunum approximate 4 cm long was created with two vascular hemoclips without
disrupting the mesenteric vascular arcades. The length of intestine between the two
clips was injected with 5.7 × 105 CFUs. Bioluminescence imaging was performed
using IVIS Spectrum (Caliper) per instructions of the manufacturer. Mice were
kept anaesthetized and bioluminescence was recorded between 80 and 90 min after
injection of bioluminescent bacteria.
Biochemical analysis. Plasma levels of ethanol were measured using the
Ethanol Assay Kit (BioVision). Levels of ALT were measured using Infinity ALT
kit (Thermo Scientific). Hepatic triglyceride levels were measured using the
Triglyceride Liquid Reagents Kit (Pointe Scientific). Hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase
(ADH) activity was measured using the ADH Assay Kit (BioVision). Plasma LPS
(Cloud-Clone Corp), and fecal albumin levels (Bethyl lab) were measured by
ELISA. Whole blood was collected into potassium EDTA–containing Microvette
100 tubes (Sarstedt), and automated complete blood counts (CBCs) were obtained
using a Scil Vet abc automatic hematology analyzer (Scil Animal Care). For insulin
tolerance test (ITT), following a 6-hour fasting period, an intraperitoneal dose of
0.35 or 1 U kg−1 insulin (novolin, Novo Nordisk Inc.) was administered to mice on
RC diet or HFD, respectively, and blood glucose was measured at indicated time
points. Plasma and liver levels of iron were measured using a kit from Thermo
Scientific.
Measurement of gastric acid. Gastric pH was measured as described39, 40.
In brief, gastroesophageal and gastroduodenal junctions were ligated and total
gastrectomy was performed. Saline (500 μl) was injected into the lumen and the
whole stomach was placed in an oxygenated bath (37 °C) containing HEPES buffer
(pH 7.4). Histamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 200 μM) was added to the bath for
60 min, the injected non-buffered saline solution was aspirated from the stomach,
and the pH was measured with a pH probe (Accumet AB15 Basic and BioBasic;
Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Staining procedures. Formalin-fixed tissue samples were embedded in paraffin
(Paraplast plus, McCornick) and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (Surgipath).
For hepatic lipid accumulation analysis, 5 μm frozen sections were cut and stained
with Oil Red O (Sigma-Aldrich). Hepatic fibrosis was assessed by morphometric
analysis of the Sirius red-stained area. For Sirius Red staining, liver tissues were
fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5 μm
thickness. Sections were stained with Sirius Red solution (saturated picric acid
(Sigma-Aldrich)) containing 0.1% Direct Red 80 (Sigma-Aldrich) to visualize
collagen deposition41. F4/80, 1:50 (14-4801-82; eBioscience), ACTA2, 1:100
(ab5694; Abcam) and IL1B, 1:50 (ab9722; Abcam) immunofluorescence
staining was performed using frozen section for the double staining with IL1B
and F4/80 staining or paraffin embedded sections for F4/80 or ACTA staining16.
All samples were analyzed by densitometry, using NIH Image J. Formalin-fixed
tissue samples were used for double-immunofluorescence analyses.
Immunoblot analyses. To measure expression of cytochrome P450 family
2 subfamily E polypeptide 1 (CYP2E1), mouse liver microsomes were isolated as
described42. Immunoblot analysis was performed using anti-CYP2E, 1:1000
(AB1252; Millipore Corporation). Antibodies against VDAC1, 1:5000 (ab14734;
Abcam) and β-actin 1:5000 (A5441; Sigma) were used to ensure equal loading for
microsome and whole-tissue extracts, respectively. An antibody against IL1B,

Fig. 5 Changes of intestinal Enterococcus growth in the absence of gastric acid during chronic ethanol feeding. a WT mice and their Atp4aSl/Sl littermates
were fed an ethanol diet (n = 3–5) for 2 weeks. We used an in vivo assay to measure luminal killing of E. coli and E. faecalis in the gut17, 38, 42. A 4 cm loop of
the proximal jejunum was ligated (without interrupting the blood supply) in anesthetized mice and injected with bioluminescent E. coli or E. faecalis. To
analyze luminal survival and killing, we performed IVIS imaging of bioluminescent E. coli and E. faecalis at 80 and 90 min, respectively, after injection of
bacteria into ligated jejunal loops. Representative images are shown. Whereas loops of ethanol-fed Atp4aSl/Sl mice had a similar amount of bioluminescent
E. coli than ethanol-fed WT mice, bioluminescent E. faecalis was found to be ninefold higher in Atp4aSl/Sl than WT mice. b The graph shows survival in
percentage of injected E. coli and E. faecalis. c C57BL/6 mice were fed an ethanol diet with or without a PPI (200 p.p.m.) for 9 weeks, before the PPI was
discontinued. Fecal Enterococcus and total luminal bacteria were measured by qPCR (n = 2–12) (2 replicates). Results are expressed as mean ± s.e.m. For

Fig. 7 MYD88/TRIF, TLR2 or IL1-receptor inhibition protects from E. faecalis -exacerbated alcoholic liver disease. C57BL/6 mice were irradiated, given
transplants of WT, Myd88−/−/TrifLPS2/LPS2 (Myd88/TrifΔBM), or Tlr2−/− bone marrow (Tlr2ΔBM) and injected with clodronate liposomes. Mice were then
gavaged with polymyxin B 150 mg kg−1 and neomycin 200 mg kg−1 body weight once daily for 1 week to facilitate colonization of E. faecalis, fed the ethanol
diet for 9 weeks, and gavaged with E. faecalis (5 × 109 CFUs; n = 14–27; 1–3 replicates) or vehicle (water; n = 14–29) (1–3 replicates) every third day. A

 1:1000 (ab9722; Abcam) was used to detect the cleaved (active) form of ILB
(17 kDa). Immunoblots were visualized with a charged coupling device camera in a
luminescent image analyzer (Gel-Doc; Bio-Rad). Immunoblots were analyzed by
densitometry, using Science Lab 2001 Image Gauge version 4.0, FUJIFILM.
Uncropped immunoblots are shown in Supplementary Figs. 9−12.
Cell culture experiments. For primary mouse hepatocytes isolation, livers were
first perfused in situ with 0.5 mM EGTA containing calcium-free salt solution,
followed by perfusion with solution containing 0.02% (w v−1) collagenase D (Roche
Applied Science). The liver was then gently minced on a Petri dish and filtered
using a 70 μm nylon cell strainer. Hepatocytes were washed three times and
centrifuged at 50 × g for 1 min. Cell viability was consistently 85% as determined by
Trypan Blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific) exclusion. A total of 1.5 × 105 cells were
plated on 12-well plates coated with rat collagen type I in DMEM-F12 (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) with insulin-transferrin-selenium (1% v v−1) (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and 40 ng ml−1 dexamethasone (MP Biomedicals) containing 10%
(v v−1) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gemini Bio-Products) and antibiotics. After 4 h,
the culture was washed with DMEM-F12 media and changed to the same
complemented media without FBS41.
Next day, primary mouse Kupffer cells were isolated from mice by two-step
collagenase–pronase perfusion followed by three-layer discontinuous density
gradient centrifugation with 8.2% (w v−1) and 14.5% (w v−1) Nycodenz
(Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corporation) to obtain Kupffer-cell fraction.
Kupffer cell fraction was selected positively by magnetic cell sorting using
anti-CD11b Micro Beads (Miltenyi Biotech). 2 × 105 Kupffer cells were plated
on 12-well plates and cultured with RPMI 1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
containing 10% (v v−1) FBS for 4 h. Following an overnight starvation in
medium without FBS, Kupffer cells were stimulated with heat-inactivated and
sonicated E. faecalis (MOI 25) for 8 h, respectively. RNA was extracted from
Kupffer cells and used for qPCR.

 For conditioned medium and IL1B neutralization experiments, Kupffer cells
were cultured with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS (v v−1) for 4 h and
serum starved in DMEM/F-12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with insulin-transferrin-
selenium (1% v v−1) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 40 ng ml−1 dexamethasone
(MP Biomedicals) overnight. Kupffer cells were then stimulated with heat-
inactivated and sonicated E. faecalis (MOI 25) for 8 hours with the same culture
medium containing 10% FBS (v v−1). Cell supernatants were transferred to
hepatocytes, and incubated for 24 h. A neutralizing antibody against IL1B (10 ng ml−1;
ab9722; Abcam) or isotype IgG (10 ng ml−1; Santa Cruz Biotechnologyl) was added
to the conditioned medium after the transfer. Hepatocyte cytotoxicity was assessed
using the Pierce LDH Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and
total IL1B was measured in the cell supernatant by ELISA (eBioscience).
Human stool samples. Healthy individuals without chronic disease who were not
taking PPIs (controls, n = 14) were given omeprazole (40 mg) to be taken daily
before breakfast for 14 days. Baseline features of this cohort have been described by
us9. Stool samples were collected before and after 14 days of PPI treatment. DNA
extracted from fecal samples was used for qPCR to detect Enterococcus, and
normalized to 16S rRNA concentrations. One sample collected before PPI
administration and two collected afterward had too low DNA concentrations and
could not be amplified by qPCR. Written informed consent was signed by each
participant after the nature and possible consequences of the studies were
explained. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board
from each institution involved.
Alcohol-dependent patients taking PPI (n = 3) or not taking PPI (n = 8) were
included in the study. All patients were actively drinking. Stool samples were
collected and RNA was extracted from fecal samples32 and RT-qPCR performed.
Written informed consent was signed by each participant after the nature and
possible consequences of the studies were explained. The study protocol was
approved by the Institutional Review Board from each institution involved.
Human study population. We used data from Danish population based healthcare
databases covering a population region with 2.2 million inhabitants to examine the
association between PPI use and development of ALD among chronic alcohol
abusers. Chronic alcohol abusers were identified through the Danish National
Patient Registry, which contains hospital discharge diagnoses from every inpatient

 or outpatient hospital contact, coded according to ICD-1043. Hospital diagnoses of
ALD were identified through the same registry (ICD-10: K70.x), and PPI use was
identified through the pharmacy registry of reimbursed prescriptions covering all
pharmacies in 1998 or later44. Results of liver biochemistry tests were extracted
from the regional laboratory information system covering all hospitals.
We followed all patients with a first-time diagnosis of chronic alcohol abuse
after 1 January 2001 (ICD-10 codes: F10.x except F10.0) from their initial diagnosis
to the date they were diagnosed with ALD (ICD-10: K70.x) or died. Other patients
were censored on 1 January 2013. We excluded patients who did not receive all of
the following liver-related tests during the period from 90 days before until 7 days
after their first diagnosis of chronic alcohol abuse: bilirubin, INR, creatinine,
albumin, ALT, platelet count, and sodium. We used the cumulative incidence
function to compute the cumulative risk of being diagnosed with ALD for groups
defined by PPI history up to inclusion (never user, previous user, or active user)45.
We defined previous users as those who had not filled a prescription for PPI in the
year before study inclusion, but who had filled a prescription prior to that year.
Diagnoses of alcoholic liver disease were made based on the combination of history
of alcohol abuse and increased levels of liver enzymes, in the absence of other
causes for liver disease. We used Cox regression to compare rates of diagnosis of
ALD among the 3 groups, adjusting for confounding by sex, age, and liver-related
biochemistry at the time of inclusion. The Danish Data Protection Board has
approved the study (record no 2013-41-1924).
Statistical analysis. Results are expressed as mean ± s.e.m. Numbers for biological
replicates are listed in Supplementary Data 1. Significance was evaluated using the
unpaired Student t test, Mann–Whitney U-statistic test, or one-way analysis of
variance with Newman–Keuls post-test. Fisher’s exact test was used in the analysis
of positive Enterococcus cultures. A Cox regression model was used to compare risk
among PPI users in a cohort of alcohol-dependent patients. A P value < 0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.
