ABSTRACT 
 
 
Natural killer (NK) cells are tightly regulated by the JAK–STAT signaling pathway 
and cannot survive in the absence of STAT5. We now report that STAT5-defi
 cient NK 
cells can be rescued by overexpression of BCL2. Our experiments defi
 ne STAT5 as a master regulator 
of NK-cell proliferation and lytic functions. Although NK cells are generally responsible for killing tumor 
cells, the rescued STAT5-defi
 cient NK cells promote tumor formation by producing enhanced levels of 
the angiogenic factor VEGFA. The importance of VEGFA produced by NK cells was verifi
 ed by experi-
ments with a conditional knockout of VEGFA in NK cells. We show that STAT5 normally represses the 
transcription of VEGFA in NK cells, in both mice and humans. These fi
 ndings reveal that STAT5-directed 
therapies may have negative effects: In addition to impairing NK-cell–mediated tumor surveillance, 
they may even promote tumor growth by enhancing angiogenesis. 
 
SIGNIFICANCE: The importance of the immune system in effective cancer treatment is widely recognized. 
We show that the new signal interceptors targeting the JAK–STAT5 pathway may have dangerous side 
effects that must be taken into account in clinical trials: inhibiting JAK–STAT5 has the potential to promote 
tumor growth by enhancing NK-cell–mediated angiogenesis.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that 
develop from a common lymphoid progenitor in the bone 
marrow ( 
1 
). They represent the fi
 rst line of defense against 
infected, stressed, and malignant cells. Recent evidence has 
assigned distinct features and functions to tissue-specifi
 c 
NK cells ( 
2 
). NK cells have organ-specifi
 c properties, such as 
distinct profi
 les of receptor expression or cytokine produc-
tion ( 
3 
). Uterine NK cells secrete high levels of VEGFA and

Surveillance to Tumor Promotion

are involved in placental vascularization. The physiologic 
functions of other organ-specifi
 c NK-cell subsets are less well 
understood ( 
4 
). 
 
All aspects of NK-cell development are regulated by 
cytokines, their downstream signaling pathways, and tran-
scriptional regulators. These include key cytokines such as 
IL2, IL12, IL15, IL18, and IL21 ( 
5 
), most of which signal via 
the common  
γ chain ( 
5 
) and activate the JAK–STAT path-
way ( 
6 
). JAK kinases (JAK1–3 and TYK2) bind to cytokine 
receptors and are activated by ligand/receptor binding. The 
activated kinase phosphorylates STAT transcription factors 
(STAT1–STAT6; refs.  
6, 7 
). 
 
Consistent with its function as the major STAT protein 
downstream of IL7, IL2, and IL15, STAT5 is absolutely essen-
tial for conventional NK-cell development and survival; 
Stat5 
 
Δ 
/ 
Δ  
Ncr1- 
iCre 
Tg mice lack NK cells ( 
8 
). It is also important 
for lymphoid cell development ( 
9 
): STAT5 is constitutively 
active in a plethora of lymphoid malignancies ( 
10 
). Recent 
studies have described somatic  
Stat5b mutations as active 
drivers of lymphoid malignancies ( 
11, 12 
), and considerable 
efforts are under way to develop STAT5 inhibitors. Such 
inhibitors will not only target malignant hematopoietic cells 
but will also have severe consequences for immune functions 
that depend on the activation of STAT5 by cytokines. A 
precise understanding of the detailed function of STAT5 in 
immune cells is required to predict the potential side effects 
of a STAT5-directed therapy. 
 
We now provide the fi
 rst evidence that STAT5 is more 
than a master regulator of NK-cell survival, proliferation, 
and cytotoxicity: It also inhibits NK-cell–mediated tumor 
angiogenesis by directly suppressing transcription of the 
angiogenic factor VEGFA. This fi
 nding forces us to recon-
sider the potential consequences of STAT5-directed therapies 
for NK-cell–surveilled tumors.

ting (Supplementary Fig. S1F–S1H). The results confirmed 
that  
Bcl2

STAT5 Regulates NK-Cell Maturation 
 
NK-cell maturation takes place in distinct stages, which can 
be distinguished by the expression of CD27 and CD11b. NK 
cells acquire CD27 before they express CD11b. CD27 
 
+  
CD11b 
 
+  
 
NK cells represent cytotoxic NK cells, which cease to express 
CD27 to become CD27 
 
−  
CD11b 
 
+  ( 
18, 19 
). Loss of one allele 
of  
Stat5 results in reduced numbers of CD27

associated with the appearance of highly immature NK cells 
(CD27

Fig. 1D 
). A similar pattern was observed in 
 
Vav-Bcl2 mice, as  
Bcl2 expression stabilizes the immature NK-
cell stage (

). NK-cell maturation can be induced by type 1 
interferon in  
Vav-Bcl2

STAT5 Regulates NK-Cell Proliferation and the

STAT5 regulates genes involved in cell-cycle control, 
including c-MYC and D-type cyclins (

the requirement for STAT5 in NK-cell proliferation, we ana-
lyzed growth curves of purifi

with the reduced STAT5 activation found in nonactivated 
 
ex vivo 
–derived  
Vav-Bcl2 
 NK cells, we found a decrease in 
levels of the effector molecules ( 
Fig. 2E 
; Supplementary Fig. 
S3A). In contrast, no differences were observed upon activa-
tion in interferon-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B and 
S3C).  
In vitro cytotoxicity assays confi
 rmed the physiologic 
signifi
 cance of these observations: NK cells with diminished 
levels of STAT5 cannot effi
 ciently lyse target cells (

a tumor-promoting effect was only observed in the presence 
of STAT5-defi
 cient NK cells; the effect could be reversed by 
depletion of NK cells ( 
Fig. 3F 
; Supplementary Fig. S4D). 
 
This result suggests that NK cells that survive the loss of 
STAT5 are able to accelerate tumor formation and that STAT5 
acts as a molecular switch in NK cells, regulating tumor sup-
pression and tumor promotion. Irrespective of the ability 
of NK cells to recognize and eradicate tumor cells, lowering 
STAT5 levels in NK cells will exacerbate tumor growth. We 
tested this interpretation in a tumor model that is not subject 
to immune surveillance by NK cells ( 
25, 27 
). Upon s.c. injec-
tion, RMA cells induced tumor development to a comparable 
extent and with similar kinetics in

responsible for the enhanced tumor progression. 
  
 
 
NK Cells Secrete VEGFA and Promote 
Endothelial Cell Growth 
 
The development of subcutaneous tumors relies on the 
formation of new blood vessels (

angiogenesis, and we found signifi

 rmed 
in assays with aortic rings embedded in 3-D collagen matri-
ces. Supernatants of

NK Cells as Tumor Promoters
RESEARCH ARTICLE
lung that require less angiogenesis. In addition, the lung is 
well oxygenized, reducing the need for angiogenesis in evolv-
ing small tumors. 
 
Myeloid cells are a source of VEGFA in the tumor micro-
environment ( 
29, 30 
). We found that both myeloid cells and 
NK cells infi
 ltrate  
v-abl 
 
 
+  tumors in comparable numbers 
between all genotypes ( 
Fig. 5F 
; Supplementary Fig. S7A–
S7C). Although both NK cells and myeloid cells are present 
around blood vessels, the results of experiments with VEGFA-
defi
 cient NK cells show the  
in vivo 
 signifi
 cance of NK-cell–
derived VEGFA for hematopoietic tumors. 
 
 
 
STAT5 Regulates VEGFA Production 
in Mice and Humans 
 
We have shown that loss or absence of STAT5 is associated 
with increased levels of VEGFA. To investigate how STAT5 
interferes with the production of VEGFA, we stimulated  
ex 
vivo– 
derived NK cells with IL2 or IL2 
+ 
IL15. Both cytokines 
strongly activate STAT5, accompanied by a decrease in  
Vegfa 
 
mRNA ( 
Fig. 6A 
). STAT5 chromatin immunoprecipitation 
(ChIP 
) analysis of primary NK cells after stimulation showed 
an increase in STAT5 binding to the  
Vegfa 
 promoter ( 
Fig. 
6B 
). To investigate which cytokines affect STAT5 activation 
in NK cells, we stimulated IL2-expanded WT NK cells with 
IL6, IL12, IL15, IL18, IL21, IL23, or IFN 
β 
. Although IL6 
and IL23 do not alter STAT5 activation, IL10, IL12, IL18, 
IL21, and IFN 
β 
 lead to a clear downregulation of STAT5 
Y694  
phosphorylation ( 
Fig. 6C 
). In line with the decreased STAT5 
activation, there is a clear increase in  
Vegfa mRNA levels in NK 
cells after stimulation with IL10, IL12, IL18, IL21, or IFN 
β 
 
(Supplementary Fig. S8A). STAT5 occurs in two isoforms, 
STAT5A and STAT5B, which are encoded by adjacent genes 
and share at least 90% homology. They are generally consid-
ered to have highly redundant functions ( 
31 
), but using NK 
cells purifi
 ed from  
Stat5a 
 and  
Stat5b 
 knockout mice, we found 
that the amount of  
Vegfa mRNA was increased only in the 
absence of STAT5B ( 
Fig. 6D 
). 
 
 
Human peripheral blood NK cells are also able to produce 
 
VEGFA 
, with immature CD16 
 
−  
CD56 
bright 
 NK cells secreting 
higher levels than mature CD16 
 
+  
CD56 
 
+  NK cells ( 
4 
). We 
FACS-sorted both NK-cell populations from healthy human 
donors ( 
n 
 
 = 8) and analyzed the levels of  
STAT5 and  
VEGFA 
. We 
found that CD16 
 
−  
CD56 
bright 
 NK cells contain high levels of 
 
VEGFA 
, accompanied by low levels of  
STAT5A and B 
 and the 
downstream target  
BCL2 when compared with CD16 
 
+  
CD56 
 
+  
 
NK cells ( 
Fig. 6E 
; Supplementary Fig. S8B). Within the 
CD16 
 
−  
CD56 
bright 
 NK-cell population, we detected an inverse 
correlation between  
VEGFA and  
STAT5B 
, the relevant  
STAT5 
 
isoform regulating  
VEGFA 
 (Pearson correlation:  
R 
 
 = 
 0.689, 
 
P 
 
 = 0.003 comparing  
STAT5A and  
VEGFA and R

 –0.547, 
 
P 
 
 = 
 0.028 comparing  
STAT5B 
 and  
VEGFA 
; Supplementary Fig. 
S8C). The data were confi
 rmed by a scatter plot and a micro-
array expression analysis comparing resting and IL2-activated 
human NK cells ( 
Fig. 6F 
; Supplementary Fig. S8D). Upon 
stimulation with IL2, human NK cells upregulate STAT5 
target genes, such as  
EOMES, CCND2 
, and  
CISH 
, whereas 
the expression of  
VEGFA 
 is reduced ( 
Fig. 6F 
; Supplementary 
Fig. S8D). 
 
A number of inhibitors of STAT5 and its upstream kinases 
are currently the subject of preclinical investigations and clin-
ical trials. Treatment of murine IL2-expanded NK cells with a 
preclinical STAT5 inhibitor caused a signifi
 cant upregulation 
of  
Vegfa 
 expression and a clear downregulation of the STAT5 
target genes  
Bcl2, Mcl1 
, and  
Cish (Supplementary Fig. S8E). 
Treatment of mouse NK cells with ruxolitinib, an inhibitor 
of the upstream kinases JAK1/2/3, signifi
 cantly increased 
the levels of  
Vegfa 
 mRNA ( 
Fig. 7A 
). Treatment of FACS-
sorted CD3 
 
−  
CD56 
 
+  
 peripheral blood mononuclear cells with 
0.5  
μ 
mol/L ruxolitinib was suffi
 cient to prevent activation 
of STAT5, as indicated by STAT5 
Y694  phosphorylation ( 
Fig. 
7B 
). After a 3-hour treatment with the inhibitor, human 
peripheral blood NK cells expressed signifi
 cantly higher lev-
els of  
VEGFA ( 
Fig. 7C 
), suggesting that ruxolitinib not only 
inhibits STAT5 signaling but also stimulates the secretion 
of proangiogenic factors. This fi
 nding is of direct relevance 
to patients. The effect is observed  
in vivo

ment of

confi

DISCUSSION 
 
We report that STAT5-defi
 cient NK cells are rescued by 
overexpression of the antiapoptotic gene  
Bcl2 
. This fi
 nding 
enabled us to investigate the functions of STAT5 in NK cells. 
STAT5 is a key regulator of NK-cell maturation, proliferation, 
and cytotoxicity. Not only does STAT5 regulate the transcrip-
tion of genes that have been identifi
 ed as targets in other cell 
types ( 
Myc, Ccnd2 
, or  
Prf1 
; ref.  
32 
), but also it is involved in the 
regulation of the transcription factors  
Eomes and  
Id2 
.  
Vav-Bcl2 
 
mice show reduced basal levels of STAT5 in nonactivated NK 
cells, together with an impairment of NK-cell maturation 
and reduced levels of effector molecules, whereas NK-cell 
proliferation and cytotoxicity are largely unimpaired. Stimu-
lation with cytokines causes maturation, consistent with the 
idea that the delay in maturation is related to a decreased 
level of cytokine receptors in nonactivated  
Bcl2– 
transgenic 
NK cells (data not shown).  
Vav-Bcl2 mice are comparable 
with wild-type mice in many key functions, such as NK-cell 
tumor surveillance. In contrast,

Δ  
Ncr1- 
iCre 
Tg 
- 
Vav-Bcl2 
 
mice that lack STAT5 in NK cells show severely hampered 
NK-cell function. 
 
The most striking fi
 nding is that NK cells promote tumor 
formation in the absence of STAT5. We show that wild-type 
cytotoxic NK cells secrete signifi
 cant levels of  
Vegfa 
 and that 
transcription of  
Vegfa is suppressed by STAT5, especially by 
STAT5B. Loss of STAT5 causes increased production of  
Vegfa 
 
in two mouse models. The increased levels of  
Vegfa 
 promote 
tumor formation. Experiments with conditional knockout 
mice have confi
 rmed the signifi
 cance of the protumorigenic 
role of NK-cell–derived  
Vegfa 
: Loss of NK-cell–derived  
Vegfa 
 
decreases tumor burden while increasing disease latency. 
 
Immune cells such as tumor-associated macrophages pro-
mote tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis ( 
29, 30 
). 
However, tumor-infi
 ltrating NKp46 
 
+  
 NK cells are also found 
in the surroundings of blood vessels, and VEGFA produced 
by NK cells enhances the formation of lymphoid tumors.

 ltrating immature NK cells that secrete VEGFA have been

STAT5B suppresses VEGFA production by directly binding to its promoter. A,  
ex vivo– 
derived MACS-purifi

Vegfa mRNA levels. Data 
represent mean

Rplp0 
, and all values were 
normalized to stimulation with IL2 (2 hours) highlighting the relative decrease. Tukey  
post-hoc test was applied for statistical analysis. B, primary IL2 
cultured NK cells were stimulated for 30 minutes with IL2 or IL2

an anti-STAT5 antibody, and n-fold enrichment of  
Vegfa or  
Cish (positive control) was calculated relative to the expression of a negative region (“CD19 
down”). Statistics represent mean

Which cells are primarily responsible for producing VEGFA in 
a particular context presumably depends on the type and stage

NK cells and macrophages interact to promote tumor growth 
and angiogenesis. It will be of great interest to test whether NK 
cells contribute to the polarization of macrophages.

RESEARCH ARTICLE
 
Depending on the context, NK cells may have either cyto-
toxic or angiogenic functions. We propose that STAT5 regu-
lates the switch between the two effects. There is ample 
evidence that tumor-infi
 ltrating NK cells have low cytotoxic 
potential. It has been speculated that treatment with IL2 
and IL15 reactivates noncytotoxic NK cells ( 
35 
). Our data 
support the idea: These cytokines signal via STAT5 and may 
help to revert tumor-infi
 ltrating but exhausted NK cells into 
killers that produce perforin and IFN 
γ 
. Decidual NK cells 
have previously been shown to possess two types of activity: 
They normally produce signifi
 cant amounts of VEGFA, but 
stimulation with IL15 switches them to cytotoxic cells ( 
36 
). 
We fi
 nd that cytokines present in the tumor microenviron-
ment, such as IL10, IL12, IL18, IL21, and IFN 
β 
, decrease the 
activity of STAT5 (refl
 ected by reduced phosphorylation of 
STAT5 
Y694 ) while enhancing expression of VEGFA. These 
results are consistent with the notion that cytokine-induced 
STAT5 regulation acts to convert NK cells from cytotoxic kill-
ers to tumor promoters. 
 
The development of STAT5 inhibitors is currently at the 
preclinical stage. To the best of our knowledge, no specifi
 c 
STAT5 inhibitor has entered clinical trials. Nevertheless, 
several inhibitors of the upstream JAK kinases have been 
approved by the FDA, e.g., for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis, and are currently being tested in a wide variety of 
clinical studies. In patients with advanced myelofi
 brosis, 
the JAK1/2/3 inhibitor ruxolitinib is of clinical benefi
 t. It 
reduces the tumor burden associated with a reduction in the 
levels of cytokines, including VEGFA, which is most likely 
produced by the tumor cells themselves ( 
37 
). Previous work 
has shown that long-term ruxolitinib treatment impairs the 
maturation and cytolytic functions of NK cells.  
Patients 
with myeloproliferative neoplasm treated with the inhibitor 
suffer from recurrent infections ( 
38 
). We now extend these 
fi
 ndings by showing that ruxolitinib signifi
 cantly increases 
the amount of VEGFA in NK cells. Ruxolitinib treatment of 
mice injected with  
v-abl 
 
 
+  
 lymphoma cells caused a signifi
 -
cantly enhanced tumor burden that depends on NK-cell–
derived VEGFA. This NK-cell–mediated effect is presumably 
important in cases of minimal residual disease controlled by 
NK cells or in other situations where limited tumor burden 
is controlled by the immune system, as described in the 
Elimination, Equilibrium, and Escape 
 model ( 
39 
). Under 
these circumstances, NK cells keep the tumor in check, and 
there is a delicate balance between tumor and immune cells. 
The balance can be disrupted by the presence of factors that 
suppress STAT5, such as cytokines or JAK–STAT inhibitors. 
 
We conclude that treatment with inhibitors of STAT5 or 
its upstream kinase not only hampers the cytotoxic func-
tion of NK cells but might also induce  
Vegfa 
 expression, 
thereby worsening the prognosis. NK cells have also been 
shown to inhibit angiogenesis by secreting IFN 
γ 
 ( 
40 
). The 
reduced release of IFN 
γ 
 in STAT5-defi
 cient NK cells may 
contribute to angiogenesis, although the molecular details 
remain to be elucidated. It is becoming clear that NK cells 
are not mere killing machines but complex players with 
tightly controlled effector responses. These need to be thor-
oughly investigated before we can predict with confi
 dence 
the outcome of STAT5-directed therapy. In the meantime, it 
is important to monitor very closely the tumor development 
in patients undergoing clinical trials of JAK–STAT inhibi-
tors, with complementary anti-VEGF therapy indicated if 
tumor growth is accelerated.

mittee and review board conforming to Austrian law (license 
66.009/0019-II/10b/2010,

Cell Culture 
 
Splenic NK cells were isolated using the MACS-positive selection 
kit (DX5; Miltenyi) and cultured with 5,000 U/mL rhIL2 (Proleukin; 
Roche). NK-cell stimulations were performed in the presence of 5,000 
U/mL rhIL2  
± 5 ng/mL rmIL12 (R&D), 50 ng/mL rmIL15 (Pepro-
Tech), 100 U/mL rmIFN 
β (Sigma), 5 ng/mL rmIL10 (R&D), 100 ng/
mL rmIL21 (Immunotools), 50 ng/mL rmIL23 (R&D), 100 ng/mL 
rmIL18 (R&D), 50 ng/mL rmIL6 (R&D), 50 ng/mL rmIL6R 
α 
 (R&D), 
or 10 ng/mL Phorbol-12-myristat-13-acetat (PMA; Sigma)/250 ng/
mL ionomycin (Sigma). For  
in vitro 
 activation of Cre recombinase in 
NK cells expressing Mx1Cre, IL2-expanded NK cells were treated with 
1,000 U/mL rmIFN 
β 
 (pbl Assay Science). 
 
For inhibitor studies, splenic mouse or human peripheral blood 
NK cells were treated for 3 hours with 0.5/1  
μ 
mol/L ruxolitinib 
(Chemietek) or 4 hours with a small-molecule STAT5 inhibitor ( 
46 
), 
and DMSO was used as vehicle control. 
 
RMA and RMA-S cell lines were kindly provided by A. Cerewenka 
and authenticated by fl
 ow cytometry.  
V-abl 
 
+  
 cell lines were gener-
ated in the laboratory of Professor V. Sexl. All lines were tested for 
the absence of  
Mycoplasma 
 by PCR and surface marker expression 
by fl
 ow cytometry every 6 months (last authentication: November 
2015). 
 
 
 
Spheroid Sprouting Assays 
 
Murine endothelial cells were suspended in 80% endothelial 
cell growth medium (RPMI containing 10% FCS), mixed 1:1 with 
Endothelial Cell Growth Medium MV (PromoCell) and 20% methyl-
cellulose (Sigma), and seeded as drops (800 cells/100  
μ 
L) in nonad-
herent dishes. The dishes were incubated upside down as hanging 
drops for 24 hours. Under these conditions, all suspended cells 
contribute to the formation of a single spheroid per drop of defi
 ned 
size and cell number. Spheroids were harvested and seeded in a col-
lagen matrix, and supernatant of IL2-expanded NK cells or 30 ng/mL 
m 
VEGFA 
 (PeproTech) was added. Two  
μ 
g/mL LEAF purifi
 ed anti-
mouse VEGFA Antibody (2G11-2A05; BioLegend) was added for 
the neutralization experiments. After 24-hour incubation, spheroids 
were scanned and photographed with an Olympus IX71 microscope 
using cellSens Dimension Software (Olympus). The sprout number 
and the cumulative length of the sprouts from each spheroid were 
calculated with ImageJ software.

In the A-MuLV model, newborn mice were injected with 100  
μ 
L of 
replication-incompetent ecotropic retrovirus encoding for  
v-abl by 
s.c. injection as described previously ( 
48 
). Mice were checked daily 
for disease onset. 
 
 
 
Drug Treatment of Mice 
 
Ruxolitinib (Chemietek) was dissolved to make a stock solution in 
DMSO and further diluted for oral gavage in PBS containing 0.5% 
methylcellulose (w/v) and 0.1% Tween 80. Mice were treated continu-
ously once a day after tumor cell injection by oral gavage with 95 mg/kg 
ruxolitinib. 
 
 
 
Antibodies and Flow Cytometry 
 
The following antibodies (clones) were purchased from BD Bio-
sciences: CD3ε(145-2C11), CD3(UCHT1), CD56(B159), CD16(3G8), 
CD11b(M1/70), CD27(LG.3A10), IFN 
γ 
(XMG1.2) or purchased 
from eBioscience/Affymetrix: CD3ε(17A2, 145-2C11), CD49b(DX5), 
NK1.1(PK136), NKp46(29A1.4), Granzyme B(NGZB), T-bet(4B10), 
Eomes(Dan11mag), and Perforin (eBioOMAK-D). Granzyme A(3G8.5) 
was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Liver and lung were 
perfused, and liver lymphocytes were obtained by a Percoll (GE Health-
care) gradient. Lung tissue was Collagenase/DNaseI (Sigma) digested 
prior to FACS staining. Bones were smashed with a mortar and fi
 ltered 
through a nylon mesh to obtain single-cell suspension. Whole blood 
and splenocytes were depleted of erythrocytes, and anti-CD16/CD32 
(eBioscience) was added to all samples prior to staining. Intracel-
lular stainings were performed with the Foxp3/Transcription factor 
staining buffer set (eBioscience) after application of a fi
 xable viability 
dye (eBioscience). BrdUrd (Sigma) was injected i.p. 16 hours prior to 
analysis, and incorporation was checked using an anti-BrdUrd anti-
body (BU20A; eBioscience) and DNase1 (Sigma) digestion according 
to eBioscience’
s protocol. Apoptosis stainings with IL2-expanded NK 
cells were performed with the Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit 
(eBioscience). 
 
All samples were recorded on a FACS Canto II fl
 ow cytometer or 
sorted on a FACS Aria III (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with BD 
FACS Diva software version 6.1.2 and 7.0.

ChIP 
 
MACS-purifi
 ed and IL2 cultured NK cells (10 
7 
) were either left 
untreated or stimulated with IL15 for 30 minutes followed by 
cross-linking using 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes at 37 
° 
C. The 
reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 mol/L glycine for 5 min-
utes. Cell nuclei were prepared and lysed in 1 mL of lysis buffer on 
4 
° 
C overnight (o/n) 
. Chromatin was sheared by sonication yielding 
chromatin fragments between 200 and 500 bp and diluted 2.5-fold 
in ChIP dilution buffer. Immunoprecipitations were performed at 
4 
° 
C o/n with an anti-STAT5 antibody (C-17, sc-835; Santa Cruz Bio-
technology). Chromatin was precleared using 25  
μ 
L salmon sperm 
DNA/protein A-agarose beads and incubated with the antibody o/n. 
Immune complexes were collected with 25  
μ 
L beads for 3 hours and 
washed with RIPA buffer, high salt buffer, LiCl buffer, and TE buffer. 
Samples were eluted twice in elution buffer (2% SDS, 10 mmol/L 
DTT, and 100 mmol/L NaHCO 
3 
). DNA cross-linking was reversed 
by heating at 65 
° 
C o/n followed by proteinase K digestion. DNA was 
extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated in isopropanol, and 
resuspended in TE Buffer. The predicted binding site was obtained 
using Ensemble for the sequence of the  
Vegfa promoter and blast-
ing for the potential STAT binding motif TTC(N) 
2-4 
GAA. Obtained 
DNA fragments were analyzed by qPCR using the following primer 
pairs:  
Vegfa 
: Fw: 5′-GCATGCATGTGTGTGTGTGT-3′ and Rev: 5′-GGC
AGGGACGTATGAGGATA-3′,

CD19 
down 
 
: 
Fw: 5′-CCCTCTTCTCATTCGTTTTCCA-3′ and Rev: 5′-CCAGGAAA
GAATTTGAGAAAAATCA-3′. N-fold enrichment was calculated rela-
tive to a negative region downstream of the CD19 gene (CD19 
down 
). 
 
 
 
Histology 
 
Tumors were either paraformaldehyde-fi
 xed and paraffi
 n-embed-
ded or frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT). 
Sections (3  
μ 
m) were stained with hematoxylin/eosin according to 
standard histologic procedures. CD31 (Cell Signaling; #9654S) stain-
ings were performed as previously reported ( 
49 
). The stainings were 
scanned and photographed with an Olympus IX71 or a Nikon 
Eclipse E1000 microscope using cellSens Dimension (Olympus) 
or NIS-elements (Nikon) software. Stainings of CD31 and NKp46 
(29A1.4; BioLegend) and CD31 and F4/80 (CI:A3-1; ABD Serotec) 
were performed with frozen tumor sections as previously reported 
( 
50 
) and scanned with a LSM 5 Exciter (Zeiss) or a Nikon Eclipse 
E1000 microscope. Tumors were photographed and counted at ran-
dom areas by three individual researches in a blinded manner. 
 
Microarray 
 
Data were extracted from ArrayExpress dataset E-GEOD-8059 and 
E-GEOD-50838 (Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST Arrays). The heat-
map was generated using  
ClustVis 
 software ( 
51 
). 
 
 
 
 
Statistical Analysis 
 
Student  
t 
 test, one-way ANOVA, Tukey  
post-hoc 
 test, and Mantel–
Cox log-rank tests (survival curves) were performed using GraphPad 
Prism Software version 5.04 and 6.02. For multiple comparison of 
survival curves, Bonferroni correction was applied. Statistical analysis
