Abstract
Background: Varicella is generally considered a mild disease. Disease burden is not well known and country-level
estimation is challenging. As varicella disease is not notifiable, notification criteria and rates vary between countries.
In general, existing surveillance systems do not capture cases that do not seek medical care, and most are affected
by underreporting and underascertainment. We aimed to estimate the overall varicella disease burden in Europe to
provide critical information to support decision-making regarding varicella vaccination.
Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review to identify all available epidemiological data on varicella IgG
antibody seroprevalence, primary care and hospitalisation incidence, and mortality. We then developed methods to
estimate age-specific varicella incidence and annual number of cases by different levels of severity (cases in the
community, health care seekers in primary care and hospitals, and deaths) for all countries belonging to the
European Medicines Agency (EMA) region and Switzerland.
Results: In the absence of universal varicella immunization, the burden of varicella would be substantial with a total
of 5.5 million (95% CI: 4.7–6.4) varicella cases occurring annually across Europe. Variation exists between countries
but overall the majority of cases (3 million; 95% CI: 2.7–3.3) would occur in children <5 years. Annually, 3–3.9 million
patients would consult a primary care physician, 18,200–23,500 patients would be hospitalised, and 80 varicella-related
deaths would occur (95% CI: 19–822).
Conclusions: Varicella disease burden is substantial. Most cases occur in children <5 years old but adults require
hospitalisation more often and are at higher risk of death. This information should be considered when planning and
evaluating varicella control strategies. A better understanding of the driving factors of country-specific differences in
varicella transmission and health care utilization is needed. Improving and standardizing varicella surveillance in Europe,
as initiated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), is important to improve data quality to
facilitate inter-country comparison.

 Background
Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) is a double-stranded DNA
virus of the herpes virus family [1]. It causes varicella
(chickenpox), a highly communicable disease which is
usually contracted in early childhood, typically affecting
children 2–8 years of age [1]. Varicella is usually a mild
disease, but can cause complications requiring hospital-
isation [2, 3] and, in rare instances, can even be fatal [4].
After initial infection with VZV, the virus becomes latent
in sensory nerve ganglia. Viral reactivation, which usu-
ally occurs with increased age or immunosuppression,
causes herpes zoster (shingles). Shingles is a painful con-
dition associated with complications including post-
herpetic neuralgia and cerebrovascular disease [1].
Although several vaccines for the prevention of vari-
cella are licensed in the European Union (EU), few EU
member states (n = 7) have implemented a general rec-
ommendation for their use [4]. This may be related to a
lack of data on the epidemiology of varicella at the coun-
try level. The estimation of varicella burden at country
level is challenging. Varicella is not a mandatory report-
able disease in the EU [4], and systematic pan-European
surveillance does not exist. Data, if existing, are based ei-
ther on national mandatory reporting or more rarely, on
national sentinel surveillance systems [5]. The systems
differ by the type of cases captured (all cases vs. medic-
ally attended cases or only cases with complications),
case definitions used, methods for case ascertainment
(clinical, laboratory, epidemiologically-linked, or combi-
nations thereof), and data type (case-based or aggregated
data). Additionally, available surveillance systems are al-
most all affected by underreporting [6, 7] and underas-
certainment: most surveillance systems only capture
medically attended disease but not all patients with vari-
cella seek medical care [8].
Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) on the burden of
varicella in the EU have recently been conducted by
ECDC [4] and Helmuth et al. [3], but like previous re-
views, they were descriptive in nature. We set out to
quantify the country-specific burden of varicella disease
in Europe by using all publicly available data and ex-
trapolating for those countries where we did not find
data. To our knowledge, our study is the first to system-
atically estimate the burden of varicella for individual
European countries. We anticipate that this work will
contribute to a better understanding of the burden of
varicella in Europe, and support decision-making regard-
ing varicella vaccination.
Methods
Systematic literature review
Search strategy
A PubMed search was conducted for peer-reviewed
publications reporting primary incidence, mortality or
seroprevalence data in any language in countries under
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) plus Swizerland.
The search was limited to articles published on or after
January 1st, 1995 and restricted to human studies. The
full search string used was “Varicella AND (mortality
OR complications OR epidemiology OR seroprevalence
OR prevalence OR incidence) AND (“Europe”[Mesh]
OR Austria OR Belgium OR Bulgaria OR Croatia OR
Cyprus OR “Czech Republic” OR Denmark OR Estonia
OR Finland OR France OR Germany OR Greece OR
Hungary OR Iceland OR Ireland OR Italy OR Latvia OR
Liechtenstein OR Lithuania OR Luxembourg OR Malta
OR Netherlands OR Norway OR Poland OR Portugal OR
Romania OR Slovenia OR Slovakia OR Spain OR Sweden
OR “United Kingdom” OR Switzerland)”. Additional infor-
mation was obtained from the ECDC and national health
institutes websites, and through personal communication
with national varicella surveillance focal points. Hand
searching of the reference lists of papers selected for inclu-
sion was conducted to identify additional publications.
Outcomes
Outcomes of interest for the literature review were vari-
cella IgG antibody seroprevalence, incidence of varicella
(varicella associated primary care visits and hospitalisa-
tions) and mortality.
Eligibility criteria
Studies were eligible for inclusion if: 1) they provided
data for one or more of the outcomes of interest in the
general population, 2) the data were collected before the
introduction of universal varicella immunization for
countries where universal varicella immunization has
been introduced, and 3) the study was published on or
after January 1st 1995. Studies were excluded if they did
not contain primary data or if the study population was
not representative of the general population in terms of
varicella transmission dynamics and/or risk of infection
(e.g. immunosuppressed patients, imprisoned individ-
uals, or day care workers).
Data extraction
Two reviewers (MB, MR) screened titles and abstracts.
Discrepancies were extensively discussed and no third
reviewer was necessary to resolve disagreements. Evalu-
ation of full text eligibility and data extraction was con-
ducted by a single reviewer (MR). For articles published
in languages other than English, reviewers were able to
directly read and extract articles in Dutch, German,
French, Swedish, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. For
one article in Icelandic, translation software was used
for the body text. Legends for the tables and the abstract
were provided in English by the journal. For quality con-
trol, a sample of 10% of the papers was re-extracted by a
Riera-Montes et al. BMC Infectious Diseases  (2017) 17:353

 third reviewer (TV). The following data was extracted
and stored in an MS Excel grid when available: author,
journal, year of publication, country, study design, set-
ting (community, primary care, hospital, other), popula-
tion, case ascertainment, age range, sample size, and
incidence or proportion with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs). The quality of the evidence was assessed by a sin-
gle reviewer (MR) with a risk of bias tool adapted from
the one by Hoy et al. [9] (Additional file 1). This tool
facilitated the scoring of studies from 0 to 8, with the
following four categorisations: Excellent (very low risk of
bias) – score 8 and prospective study design; Good (low
risk of bias) – score 8, but no prospective study design;
Acceptable (medium risk of bias) score 6–7; Low (high
risk of bias) – score less than 6.
Incidence estimation
We aimed to estimate the annual incidence rates of vari-
cella cases that 1) occurred in the community (with or
without health care visit), 2) resulted in an ambulatory
primary health care visit, 3) required hospitalisation, or
4) caused death.
Data sources were used for incidence estimation if: 1)
studies attained a quality score of 6 or more; 2) data col-
lection was conducted for at least 1 year; and 3) age-
specific data was provided. In cases where the same data
source was used to report incidence for different time
periods, we selected the source with the longest time
period covered and/or most recent data for inclusion in
our analyses. We excluded data derived from mandatory
notification systems which may be substantially affected
by underreporting [10], except for countries where
mandatory notification was the only data source avail-
able. When the age groups reported in the original data
source did not match our age groups of interest, we ei-
ther used weighted averages (to combine several age
groups) or we redistributed the age groups assuming
constant incidence within the age groups (to split a sin-
gle age group). Age groups without upper limits were
excluded from the calculations, because the width of the
age group was not known and therefore the incidence
cannot be recalculated for the age group of interest.
Incidence estimation for countries with data
Few studies in Europe have assessed the incidence rate
of varicella at the community level. We therefore opted
to derive the annual age-specific varicella incidence (per
100,000) from seroprevalence studies, which are com-
monly available. Particularly, for each country we first
estimated age-specific seroprevalence using the catalytic
model with a piecewise constant force of infection.
Then, from these estimated profiles, we derivedincidence
rates (and 95% CIs) as differences in seroprevalences
for six age groups, < 5, 5–9, 10–14, 15–19, 20–39
and 40+ years. This approach assumes lifelong immunity,
time homogeneity and non-differential mortality. For
more details on the methodology used, we refer to
Bollaerts et al. (Bollaerts K, Riera-Montes M, Hens N
et al. A systematic review of varicella seroprevalence
in
European
countries
before
universal
childhood
immunization: deriving incidence from seroprevalence
data. Submitted 2017).
For incidence rates at the primary care and hospital
level, we relied upon the published age-specific data for
countries with more extensive information. For coun-
tries with more than one estimate, we provide a range
with the lowest and highest estimates.
Varicella-specific mortality data was obtained from the
World Health Organisation (WHO) European Detailed
Mortality Database (DMDB) [11]. The DMDB contains
mortality data by cause of death (ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes),
age and sex. Other country-specific mortality data sources
identified during the SLR were found either to rely upon
the
same
data
source
that
feeds
into
the
WHO
DMDB or to provide comparable results. We obtained
mortality data for all countries for the 10 most recent
years available prior to the introduction of universal
varicella immunization. We calculated the Poisson
exact 95% CIs of the mortality rates.
Incidence estimation for countries without data
To obtain age-specific community, primary care and hos-
pital incidence estimates for countries without data, we
took a 2-step approach. Firstly, we tried to build predic-
tion models for each outcome and age group, calibrated
using information from the countries with data. Secondly,
when the model failed to predict (i.e. non-significance of
any of the potential predictor variables), we extrapolated
the minimum and maximum observed estimates within
the same age group from countries with data (Table 2).
Particularly, we built a linear regression model based on
the incidences in the younger age groups and country-
level prediction variables that have been shown to be
associated with country-level differences in varicella trans-
missibility and health care use [12, 13] (Additional file 2):
proportion of children <3 years that receive no formal
childcare [14], population density [14], inequality in in-
come distribution [14], proportion of people at risk of
poverty [14], total health expenditure [15], proportion of
households with 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more children [14], num-
ber of annual consultations of a medical doctor per inhab-
itant [14], and number of acute hospital discharges per
100 population [14].
We failed to predict primary care incidence (PCI) and
hospitalisation incidence (HI). Therefore, we relied upon
the ratio between PCI and community incidence - the
primary care rate (PCR), and on the ratio between HI
and community incidence - the hospitalisation rate (HR).
Riera-Montes et al. BMC Infectious Diseases  (2017) 17:353 
Page 3 of 16
 Specifically, we calculated PCI or HI by multiplying the
country’s age-specific community incidence with the
corresponding age-specific average minimum-maximum
observed PCR or HR. We preferred this approach to the
alternative approach of simply imputing the PCI and HI
that was observed in other countries, as this would not
take into account differences in community incidence.
No imputations were required for mortality data, as
these were available from the DMDB for all countries.
Validation
To evaluate our methodology, we used information from
a recent varicella study in Norway [16], which was con-
ducted in 2015 and published after our literature search
had concluded. This study provided both age-specific
seroprevalence proportions and age-specific estimates of
PCI at the national level. We used this published sero-
prevalence data to estimate varicella community inci-
dence and derive PCI as described above.
Estimation of annual number of cases
To estimate the annual country-specific numbers of
varicella-associated community cases, ambulatory pri-
mary care consultations, hospitalisations, and deaths per
age group, we applied age-specific community incidence,
PCI, HI, and mortality rates to each country’s population.
Population data was obtained from Eurostat for the latest
year available (2015) [14]. The total annual number of
cases within Europe was then calculated by summing the
number of cases for each country. The numbers of
varicella-associated community cases and deaths are pre-
sented as point estimates with 95% CIs, while the numbers
of varicella-related primary care consultations and hospi-
talisations are presented as a range.
We compared the estimated annual country-specific
numbers of varicella-associated community cases to the
numbers reported to EUVAC.NET, in order to estimate
the underreporting of the disease. EUVAC.NET is a
European surveillance network for selected vaccine-
preventable diseases that was active until 2011 and was
hosted by the Staten Serum Institute (SSI), Denmark. It
incorporated 18 countries; all EU Member States up to
2011, as well as Croatia, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland
and Turkey. Number of varicella cases were reported an-
nually by all countries. We compared the EUVAC.NET
data of 2009–2010 to our results, and calculated the ra-
tio of reported to estimated number of cases, expressed
in percentages.
Results
Systematic literature review
The literature search was conducted in PubMed on
October 2nd 2015. Identification of grey literature sources
was conducted between October and December 2015.
We identified 120 data sources from 31 countries for
extraction (Fig. 1) [5, 7, 8, 11, 17–127]. Most data
sources (97/120) scored the maximum in terms of qual-
ity assessment (score of 8). Only one data source scored
less than 6. A table summarizing the main characteristics
of all selected data sources, and a summarised version of
the full data extraction table is provided in Additional
files 3 and 4.
The most frequently found unique data source was on
seroprevalence (n = 52) [17–68], followed by hospitalisa-
tion (n = 39) [23, 27, 40, 69–104], primary care (n = 27)
[7, 8, 23, 27, 74, 76, 78–81, 97, 99, 102, 104–117], mor-
tality (n = 15) [11, 23, 27, 74–76, 79, 80, 84, 91, 97, 118–
121], and incidence of reported varicella cases through
mandatory surveillance (n = 14) (Table 1) [5, 26, 27, 40,
79, 80, 101, 116, 122–127]. Varicella community inci-
dence

sources from 16 countries [17–27, 29–41, 44–47, 49–54,

data sources from 8 countries [23, 74, 76, 79, 80, 99,
101, 102, 104–106, 109, 110, 112, 114, 124, 126], hospi-
talisation incidence from 18 HI data sources from 10
countries [23, 69–73, 75, 76, 79–81, 84, 87, 90, 91, 94,
102, 103], and one data source was used to estimate
mortality in 31 countries [11] (Table 2). Data on all four
outcomes was only available for six countries (Belgium,
France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK).
Varicella community incidence
The final model to predict community incidence in <5 year
olds included as country-level predictors the proportion
of children <3 years attending pre-school care and popula-
tion density, with a moderate goodness of fit (R2 = 40%).
For 5–9 year olds, the prediction model included the inci-
dence in <5 year olds with a moderate to high goodness of
fit (R2 = 80%). For the older age groups, we had to rely
upon extrapolation. We first categorised countries based
on the speed of varicella acquisition in children <5 years
(annual incidence < or ≥10%) as in Bollaerts et al. (Bol-
laerts K, Riera-Montes M, Hens N et al. A systematic re-
view of varicella seroprevalence in European countries
before universal childhood immunization: deriving inci-
dence from seroprevalence data. Submitted 2017). Then,
we extrapolated the minimum and maximum age specific
community incidence observed in countries with data
(Table 2) to countries without data within the same
category.
Age-specific annual incidence rates of varicella, as de-
rived from serological data, varied considerably across
the countries, particularly in age groups 10–14 and 15–
19 years. In most countries the highest annual incidence
was observed amongst children aged <5 years, ranging
from 7052 (Greece) to 17,974 (Malta) per 100,000 (Table
Riera-Montes et al. BMC Infectious Diseases  (2017) 17:353 
Page 4 of 16
 3). In Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Italy, Romania, Switzerland
and Greece the highest incidence was observed in 5–9 year
olds. From the age of 10 years onwards, varicella incidence
dropped drastically. Countries with the highest incidence
in children <5 years had lower incidence rates in 10–
14 year olds than those countries with the highest in-
cidence in children 5–9 years of age. By the age of
15–19 years, incidence was <1000 per 100,000 in all
countries with the exception of Greece.
Varicella primary care incidence
We failed to model the PCI for any of the age groups
and we therefore had to rely upon the maximum-
minimum approach. The estimated PCRs ranged from
18% (Netherlands, 5–9 year olds) to 100% (Netherlands,
10–64 y; Italy, 10–14 y; Spain, 10–14 y; UK, 10–39 y;
France, 5–64 y) across all age groups.
Varicella primary care incidence was highest in
children <5 years with substantial inter-country vari-
ation, ranging from 1100 per 100,000 in Romania to
13,069 per 100,000 in France. Incidence decreased with
age, dropping substantially from the age of 10 years on-
wards (Table 4).
Varicella hospitalisation incidence
We also failed to model the HI for any age group and
used the minimum-maximum approach instead. The es-
timated HRs ranged from 0.05% (Ireland, 5–9 y) to 3.5%
(Netherlands, 20–39 y) across all age groups.
All countries presented the highest HI in children <5 years.
Incidence ranged from 9 per 100,000 in Sweden to 75
per 100,000 in France, decreasing to <20 per 100,000 for
all countries in the 5–9 years age group (Table 5). In older
age groups, HI remained ≤10 per 100,000.
Varicella mortality
Estimated varicella mortality was very low with an annual
incidence <0.2 deaths per 100,000 in all age groups and
countries (Table 6). For most countries, the mortality was
highest in children <5 years. However, in some countries
(Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland, Slovakia), mortality was
higher in the 5–9 year age group, and in Lithuania, the
mortality peak was found in the 10–14 years age group.
Validation
The observed annual community incidence in children
under 10 years of age in Norway was in line with our

 predictions (8669 vs 9326 per 100,000). However, the
model overestimated the number of cases in <5 year olds
and underestimated the incidence in 5–9 year olds com-
pared to the observed data (Table 7). The model also pre-
dicted substantially higher estimates of varicella PCI in
Norway in most age groups compared to observed data,
particularly in children under 10 years of age (Table 8).
Annual number of varicella cases
We estimated that across European countries, and in the
absence of universal varicella immunization, 5.5 million
(95% CI: 4.7–6.4) new varicella cases would occur
annually. Most cases (3 million; 95% CI: 2.7–3.3) would
occur in children <5 years. At least 54% of varicella cases
are expected to result in an ambulatory primary care
visit and 0.3% will require hospitalisation (Table 9), im-
plying that annually 3–3.9 million patients would con-
sult a primary care physician and 18,200–23,500 patients
be hospitalised. In addition, approximately 80 varicella-
related deaths are expected to occur every year (95% CI:
19–822) (Fig. 2, Table 9). (See Additional file 5 for
country-specific data).
From comparing the number of annual varicella cases re-
ported to EUVAC.NET to our estimates, an important

 under-reporting to EUVAC.NET was found, with only <1%
(Greece: 6 vs 109,214 cases) to 51% (Slovenia: 11,074 vs
21,729 cases) of all cases of varicella occurring in the com-
munity reported to EUVAC.NET (Table 10) [123].
Discussion
We estimate that in the absence of universal varicella
immunization, a total of 5.5 million (95% CI: 4.7–6.4)
varicella cases would occur annually across Europe. It
has previously been estimated that the annual number
of new varicella cases in a country correspond approxi-
mately to the size of its birth cohort [4, 27, 94, 128].
Given that according to Eurostat [14] there were 5.2
million live births in Europe in 2015, this is in line with
our estimates. Our study estimates that more than half
of all varicella cases occur in children <5 years of age, as
has been reported previously [4].
We found that community incidence varied greatly be-
tween countries, particularly in children and adolescents.
This probably reflects different country-specific dynam-
ics in varicella transmission during childhood, which
have been associated with differences in social mixing
patterns [12, 13]. Countries with low incidence rates in
children <5 years of age have higher incidence rates in

 older age groups. This pattern tends to occur in coun-
tries in Eastern and Southern Europe, as has also been
observed in a previous review [3].
According to our estimates, most varicella cases (54%)
lead to a physician consultation and a small proportion
of cases (0.3%) are hospitalised. We found that the high-
est consultation rates (100%) occurred among children
aged 10 to 14 years, while the highest hospitalisation
rates (1.3%) were in 20 to 39 year olds. Case fatality rate
was highest (0.03%) in the >40 years age group followed
by the 20 to 39 years age group (0.005%). These findings
confirm that the majority of disease burden is in the
younger age groups, but disease is more severe in adults
and the elderly [4].
The main strength of our study is that we followed a
systematic approach to quantify age-specific varicella in-
cidence. In this way, we maximised transparency and
comparability across countries. We based our estimates
on the best available evidence, as obtained through a
comprehensive SLR of the epidemiology of varicella. To
estimate varicella incidence at community level we used
seroprevalence data. Unlike other surveillance data, sero-
prevalence data are not affected by health care seeking or
under-reporting and therefore provide a more accurate

 have underestimated the number of primary care visits,
hospitalisations and deaths. Some of the studies we used
in our estimations were regional only and might not be
representative for the respective whole country. Despite
our attempts to be comprehensive we cannot guarantee
that all relevant data sources were identified in this review.
However, we expect the number of missed data sources to
be low. We did not find data for all outcomes for all coun-
tries, so we extrapolated the incidence for these countries
based on data from other countries. This may have re-
sulted in over- or underestimation of the incidence for
some countries. We addressed this uncertainty by estimat-
ing 95% CIs (for the community incidence in the <5 and
5–9 year olds), or by providing a minimum-maximum
range otherwise. We did not consider immigration in our
estimates. A seroprevalence study carried out in adults in
the Netherlands [64] showed that immigrants, in particu-
lar first generation immigrants, were more likely to be
varicella seronegative compared to Dutch-born adults.
Studies in the UK, Ireland and Spain among pregnant
women have also shown that foreign-born women are
more likely to be susceptible to varicella [36, 44, 47, 57].
There is a lack of studies addressing the impact of immi-
gration on varicella epidemiology. Most seroprevalence
surveys are carried out using residual serum samples with
no information on immigration status [41]. As evidenced
by van Rijckevorsel et al. [64], varicella serological profiles
may show geographical differences within countries, with
urban areas (being areas where immigration is typically
concentrated) often presenting a higher proportion of
varicella susceptible adults. To estimate varicella mortality,
we used data from the WHO DMDB [11]. Mortality
causes are coded using International Classification of Dis-
eases (ICD)-9 or ICD-10 and it is difficult to ascertain the
accuracy of the coding. Hence misclassification of the
cause of death cannot be excluded. This may have resulted
in over or underestimation of varicella mortality.
Given the limited number of studies that looked at
specific complications and/or sequelae, we did not
model these outcomes separately. It is however note-
worthy that in addition to the immediate burden on the
health care system as discussed in this paper, varicella
may also cause complications and long term sequelae. In
children (0–17 years), reported incidence of varicella
complications requiring hospitalisation ranges from 0.82
per 100,000 of the population in the UK and Ireland
[119], to 19 per 100,000 in Belgium [75]. Differences in
incidence are probably related to differences in the defi-
nitions used for complicated varicella. In the UK study
[119] only severe complications were included, excluding
secondary skin infections, while the Belgian study [75]
included any complication. The most frequent complica-
tions reported were bacterial superinfections, followed
by varicella pneumonia and neurological complications.
Concerning long term sequelae, these are usually a result
of neurological complications of varicella. Long term se-
quelae have been reported in 0.4 to 8% of children hos-
pitalised for varicella [85, 95, 100, 103, 130].
Recent published data from Norway provided us with
an opportunity to validate the methodology used. We
found that our model overestimated the varicella com-
munity incidence in Norway in <5 year olds and under-
estimated the incidence in 5 to 9 year olds. There were
small differences in the predicted vs. observed incidence

 for ages 10 to 39, with the model underestimating the
incidence in the ≥40 year olds. The model we used to es-
timate community incidence was based on the predic-
tion variables including the percentage of children
<3 years of age receiving formal childcare and popula-
tion density. While for both prediction variables Norway
is similar to northern European countries with the high-
est incidence observed in children <5 years old, the vari-
cella epidemiology pattern in Norway also somewhat
resembles that of southern European countries with a
relatively high observed incidence in the 5 to 9 year olds.
Although we explored the inclusion of additional ex-
planatory variables in our model, none of them im-
proved the fit of the model. The methodology we used
to estimate PCI overestimated the observed PCI in
Norway, particularly in the younger age groups. We used
the minimum-maximum observed PCR to estimate PCI
in countries without data. Health care seeking behaviour,
and hence the PCR, varies strongly between countries
[104]. For example, 38% of children <5 years with vari-
cella consulting a physician [131] in the Netherlands
compared to 88% of children <3 years in France [132].
There may also be differences in hospitalisation policies
for varicella cases between countries which potentially
affect the hospitalisation rate. We tried to address this
uncertainty by estimating a minimum-maximum range
for PCI and HI. However, we cannot exclude that PCI
and HI may have been over or underestimated for some
countries, like in the case of Norway.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the estimated burden of varicella in Europe
in the pre-immunization period was substantial with more
than 5 million new cases estimated annually, of which
slightly more than half is expected to lead to a physician
consultation, about 20,000 to hospitalisation, and up to 80
to death. Since very few countries or regions have intro-
duced universal childhood varicella immunization pro-
grams, these figures are probably still true today. Although
the main share of the burden is in children <5 years old,
adults require hospitalisation more often and are at higher
risk of death. This information should be considered when
planning and evaluating varicella control strategies. Im-
proving and standardizing varicella surveillance in Europe,
as initiated by ECDC, will be important to improve the
quality of data available and allow better inter-country
comparison. There is also a need to better understand the
driving factors of country-specific differences in varicella
transmission and health care utilization. In addition, future
research on sero-epidemiology with prospective sampling
and data collection, ensuring the inclusion of migrant pop-
ulations, would further improve our understanding of the
epidemiology of varicella in Europe.
