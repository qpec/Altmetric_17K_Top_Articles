Individual patient data meta-analysis
a b s t r a c t
This individual patient data meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of exercise on quality of life (QoL)
and physical function (PF) in patients with cancer, and to identify moderator effects of demographic (age,
sex, marital status, education), clinical (body mass index, cancer type, presence of metastasis),
intervention-related (intervention timing, delivery mode and duration, and type of control group), and
exercise-related (exercise frequency, intensity, type, time) characteristics.
Relevant published and unpublished studies were identified in September 2012 via PubMed, EMBASE,
PsycINFO, and CINAHL, reference checking and personal communications. Principle investigators of all 69
eligible trials were requested to share IPD from their study. IPD from 34 randomised controlled trials
(n = 4519 patients) that evaluated the effects of exercise compared to a usual care, wait-list or attention
control group on QoL and PF in adult patients with cancer were retrieved and pooled. Linear mixed-effect
models were used to evaluate the effects of the exercise on post-intervention outcome values (z-score)
adjusting for baseline values. Moderator effects were studies by testing interactions.
Exercise significantly improved QoL (b = 0.15, 95%CI = 0.10;0.20) and PF (b = 0.18, 95%CI = 0.13;0.23).
The effects were not moderated by demographic, clinical or exercise characteristics. Effects on QoL
(bdifference_in_effect = 0.13, 95%CI = 0.03;0.22) and PF (bdifference_in_effect = 0.10, 95%CI = 0.01;0.20) were signif-
icantly larger for supervised than unsupervised interventions.
In conclusion, exercise, and particularly supervised exercise, effectively improves QoL and PF in
patients with cancer with different demographic and clinical characteristics during and following treat-
ment. Although effect sizes are small, there is consistent empirical evidence to support implementation
of exercise as part of cancer care.

Introduction
As a consequence of the increased number of cancer diagnoses,
and concomitant mortality reductions for most types of cancer
[1–3], many patients live with physical and psychosocial problems
associated with the disease and its treatment that may compromise
their quality of life (QoL). Exercise has been recommended as part of
standard care for patients with cancer to help prevent and manage
physical and psychosocial problems, and improve QoL [4,5].
Previous meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCT)
reported benefits of exercise during and following cancer treat-
ment [6]. Benefits include improved physical fitness, function,
and quality of life (QoL), and reduced fatigue, and depression [6–
9]. However, average reported effect sizes on these outcomes were
small to moderate.
To maximize benefits of exercise, it is important to target sub-
groups of patients that respond best to a particular intervention
[10]. A number of RCTs showed that demographic, clinical, and per-
sonal factors, such as age, marital status, disease stage and type of
treatment, moderate the effects of exercise in patients with cancer
[11–15]. However, these single studies are generally underpow-
ered to analyse moderators of intervention effects and conduct
subsequent stratified analysis. Meta-analyses based on aggregate
data are limited to using summary data, such as the mean age of
the patients or the proportion of men in a study, and they are
unable to investigate intervention-covariate interactions at the
level of the patient [16,17].
Optimizing benefits of exercise also requires a better under-
standing of important intervention-related characteristics, includ-
ing the timing and mode of intervention delivery, intervention
duration, and exercise dimensions, in terms of frequency, intensity,
type and time (FITT factors).
Meta-analyses of raw individual patient data (IPD) are sug-
gested as the preferred method to evaluate moderators of inter-
vention effects, since the large number of raw data points
facilitates testing of interactions at the patient level, conducting
subsequent stratified analyses, and standardizing analytic tech-
niques across the included studies [18,19]. In the current IPD
meta-analysis we used data collected in the Predicting OptimaL
Cancer RehabIlitation and Supportive care (POLARIS) study [20].
The aims were to evaluate the effects of exercise on QoL and phys-
ical function (PF) in patients with cancer, and to identify demo-
graphic, clinical, intervention-, and exercise-related moderators
of intervention effects.

 Methods
The conduct and reporting of this IPD meta-analysis is based on
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-
Analyses of Individual Participant Data (PRISMA-IPD) statement
[21].
Identification and inclusion of studies
Detailed descriptions of the design and procedures of the
POLARIS study were published previously [20]. In short, relevant
published and unpublished studies (e.g. study protocol papers)
were identified in September 2012 via systematic searches in four
electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL),
reference checking of systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and per-
sonal communication with collaborators, colleagues, and other
experts in the field [20]. POLARIS included RCTs that evaluated
the effects of exercise interventions and/or psychosocial interven-
tions on QoL compared to a wait-list, usual care or attention con-
trol group in adult patients with cancer. We excluded studies
focusing on spiritual or existential therapy, yoga, and diet or mul-
timodal lifestyle interventions. The study protocol was registered
in PROSPERO in February 2013 (CRD42013003805) [20].
A letter of invitation to join the POLARIS consortium and share
data was sent to the principal investigator (PI) of eligible RCTs. In
case of no response, we sent reminders or contacted another PI.
In case the study was not yet published, we maintained contact
about the study completion date, to allow inclusion at a later stage
during the data collection process of approximately 3 years. After
PI’s expressed interest in data sharing, they were requested to sign
a data sharing agreement stating that they agreed with the
POLARIS policy document, and were willing to share and transform
anonymised data of study participants who were randomised. Data
could be sent in various formats, were re-coded according to stan-
dardised protocols, and were checked for completeness, improba-
ble values, consistency with published articles, and missing
items. Subsequently, datasets were imported into the POLARIS
database where they were harmonized [20].
Data extraction and quality assessment
Two independent researchers (LB and MS) extracted study char-
acteristics and rated the quality of included studies from published
papers, using the ‘risk-of-bias’ assessment tool of the Cochrane
Collaboration. The quality of following aspects was graded as high
(‘+’), low (‘�’) or unclear (‘?’) quality: random sequence generation
(high quality if random component was used), allocation conceal-
ment (high quality if central, computerized allocation or sequen-
tially
numbered
sealed
envelopes
were
used),
incomplete
outcome (high quality if intention-to-treat analyses were per-
formed and missing outcome data were <10% or adequate imputa-
tion techniques were used), and incomplete reporting (high quality
if QoL or PF was reported such that data could be entered in an
aggregate data meta-analysis). We also included ratings of adher-
ence (high quality if P80% of patients had high attendance, defined
as P80% of sessions attended [22,23]) and contamination (high
quality if no or limited exercise was present in the control group,
i.e. moderate to vigorous exercise was present in <25% of patients
or increased less than 60 min [24]). Items related to blinding were
omitted because blinding of patients and personnel is difficult in
the case of exercise interventions, and QoL and PF were assessed
using patient-reported outcomes. Quality assessments of both
reviewers were compared and disagreements in the scores were
resolved by discussion.
Representativeness of included studies
To examine whether the included RCTs were a representative
sample of all eligible RCTs, we compared pooled effect sizes of RCTs
included versus those not included. Effect sizes per RCT were cal-
culated by subtracting the published average post-intervention
value of QoL or PF of the control group from that of the interven-
tion group, and dividing the result by the pooled standard devia-
tion. We corrected effect sizes for small samples as suggested by
Hedges and Olkin. Effect sizes (Hedges’ g) were pooled with a ran-
dom effects model and differences in effects between studies pro-
viding
data
and
those
that
did
not
were
examined
using
Comprehensive Meta-analysis software (version 2.2.064).
We evaluated publication bias for all eligible studies and for
studies providing data by inspecting the funnel plot and by the
Duval and Tweedie’s trim and fill procedure [25,26]. The procedure
provides estimates of the number of missing studies and the effect
size after the publication bias has been taken into account. The
Egger’s test was used to test whether the bias captured by the fun-
nel plot was significant.
Outcome variables
QoL and PF were assessed with patient reported outcomes (PRO,
Table 1). In the present paper, we used baseline (pre-intervention)
and post-intervention values. To allow pooling of the different
PROs, we recoded the individual scores into z-scores by subtracting
the individual score from the mean score at baseline, and dividing
the result by the mean standard deviation at baseline. Subse-
quently, the pooled z-scores were used for further analyses. If stud-
ies used both a cancer-specific and a generic QoL PRO, data from
the cancer-specific PRO were used.
Possible moderators
Potential demographic and clinical moderators were identified
from single studies that reported on the moderating effects with
some inconsistent findings [11–14,27].
Potential demographic moderators included baseline age, sex,
marital status, and education level. Marital status was dichoto-
mised into single versus married or living with partner. As a conse-
quence of different coding schemes of the original RCTs, education
level was dichotomised into low-medium (elementary, primary, or
secondary school, lower or secondary vocational education) or high
(higher vocational, college, or university education). Potential clin-
ical moderators included body mass index (BMI), type of cancer,
the presence of distant metastases, and type of treatment. BMI
was categorised into underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight
(18.5–<25 kg/m2),
overweight
(25–<30 kg/m2)
and
obese
(P30 kg/m2) according to the World Health Organization. The type
of cancer was categorised into breast, male genitourinary, gastroin-
testinal, haematological, gynaecological, respiratory tract, and
other types. Treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
hormone therapy or stem cell transplantation were each dichoto-
mised into previous or current treatment versus no such treat-
ment. As the majority of men diagnosed with prostate cancer
received androgen deprivation therapy, we were unable to study
the moderating effects of hormone therapy in prostate cancer.
Timing of intervention delivery in relation to primary cancer
treatment was categorised into pre-treatment, during treatment,
post-treatment and end-of-life, according to the Physical Activity
and Cancer Control (PACC) framework [28]. Because interventions
pre-treatment and during end-of-life were not available, we tested
differences in intervention effects between those delivered during
treatment versus post-treatment. As hormone therapy for breast
cancer may continue for five years post-treatment, we considered

 women on hormone therapy who completed other primary cancer
treatments as being post-treatment. Men receiving androgen
deprivation therapy for prostate cancer were considered as being
during treatment. Delivery mode of intervention was dichoto-
mized into supervised (in case (part of) the weekly exercise ses-
sions were conducted under supervision) versus unsupervised (in
case exercise sessions were performed unsupervised from or at
home). Intervention duration was categorised based on tertiles
(612 weeks; >12–24 weeks; >24 weeks). Exercise frequency was
dichotomised based on the median, into 62 versus >2 supervised
sessions per week for supervised exercise and into <5 versus P5
sessions per week for unsupervised exercise. Exercise intensity
was categorised from low to high intensity using the definitions
of the American College of Sports Medicine [29]. Exercise type
was categorised into aerobic, resistance, combined aerobic and
resistance and combined resistance and impact loading (e.g. skip-
ping, jumping) exercise. Exercise time per session was categorised
into 630 min, >30–60 min and >60 min.
Statistical analysis
We conducted one-step IPD meta-analyses to study the effects
and moderators of exercise on QoL and PF. The effects were evalu-
ated by regressing the intervention on the post-intervention value
(z-score) of the outcome adjusted for the baseline value (z-score)
using linear mixed model analyses with a two-level structure (1:
patient; 2: study) to take into account the clustering of patients
within studies by using a random intercept on study level. Moder-
ators of exercise effects were examined by adding the moderator
and its interaction term with the intervention into the regression
model, for each moderator separately. To reduce ecological bias
for patient-level interactions, we separated within-trial interaction
from between-trial interaction by centring the individual value of
the covariate around the mean study value of that covariate [19].
If interaction terms were significant (p < 0.05), stratified analyses
were performed. In case a RCT had three study arms with different
study-level moderators across study arms, interaction testing for a
study-level moderator was not possible. Therefore, in those situa-
tions, we tested differences between subgroups using dummy vari-
ables. Regression coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CI)
were reported, which represent the between group difference in
z-scores of QoL and PF, and correspond to a Cohen’s d effect size.
Effects of 0.2 were considered small, 0.50 as moderate and at or
above 0.8 as large.
Since the majority of patients were women with breast cancer,
we performed a sensitivity analysis to check robustness of findings
in the subgroup of patients that were not women with breast can-
cer, despite non-significant overall interaction effects for women
with breast cancer vs other (b = 0.09, 95%CI = �0.12; 0.29 for
QoL; b = �0.06, 95%CI = �0.27;0.14 for PF). Statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS 22.0 and R Studio.
Results
Characteristics of studies and patients
Of the 136 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1), 66 eval-
uated the effects of exercise and three [30–32] evaluated the
effects of a combined exercise and psychosocial intervention and
also included a third arm with exercise only. Principal investigators
of 34 of these 69 RCTs (response 49%) shared IPD. In total, 27 RCTs

 provided information on contamination met the criteria for high
quality.
The sample included 4519 patients with cancer, of whom 2514
were randomized to the intervention group and 2005 to the control
group. The mean age was 54.6 (SD 11.3) years, 78% were women,
70% were diagnosed with breast cancer, 2% had metastatic disease,
51% exercised following cancer treatment, and 65% received super-
vised exercise (Table 2).
Representativeness and publication bias
Published summary data for QoL were available for 36 out of 69
RCTs, of which five [27,33–36] included two exercise arms. Conse-
quently, 41 exercise arms were included in the analyses of repre-
sentativeness. For PF, summary data were published for 30 RCTs,
with two [27,37] evaluating two exercise arms, resulting in 32
exercise arms. We found no significant differences in effects on
QoL (p = 0.25) and PF (p = 0.25) between RCTs of which IPD were
shared and those of which were not (Table 3). The trim and fill pro-
cedures showed significant publication bias for all eligible RCTs
reporting on QoL, but not between RCTs included and those not
included (Table 3).
Effects and moderators of exercise on QoL and PF
Exercise effects on QoL (b = 0.15, 95%CI = 0.10;0.20) and PF
(b = 0.18, 95%CI = 0.13;0.23, Table 4, Fig. 2) were significant.
Patients’ demographic and clinical characteristics, intervention
timing and duration, and exercise FITT factors did not significantly
moderate the effects on QoL or PF (Table 4). Supervised exercise
had significantly larger effects on QoL (bdifference_in_effect = 0.13,
95%CI = 0.04;0.23)
and
PF
(bdifference_in_effect = 0.11,
95%
CI = 0.01;0.20) than unsupervised exercise. Compared to the con-
trol group, supervised exercise significantly improved both QoL
(b = 0.20, 95%CI = 0.14;0.25) and PF (b = 0.22, 95%CI = 0.16;0.27),
while unsupervised exercise significantly improved PF (b = 0.11,
95%CI = 0.03;0.19). Effects on PF were significantly larger in RCTs
with a usual care control group than those with an attention con-
trol group (bdifference_in_effect = 0.12, 95%CI = 0.002;0.23).
Sensitivity analyses among patients other than women with
breast cancer (n = 1360, originating from 17 RCTs) showed slight
differences in regression coefficients with larger confidence inter-
vals, but the conclusions on moderator effects were similar.
Discussion
Based on IPD meta-analyses of 34 RCTs including data from
4519 individual patients with cancer, we found that exercise
significantly improved their QoL and PF. The IPD meta-analytical
approach of the present paper enabled the testing of potential
moderators in a large sample. The exercise effects did not differ
significantly across subgroups of age, sex, education level, marital
status, BMI, cancer type, metastatic stage or treatment. Further,
exercise was equally effective during and following cancer treat-
ment. These findings support and strengthen the evidence base

 for current exercise recommendations that all patients with cancer
should be physically active during and following cancer treatment
[4]. However, the effects were stronger for supervised exercise. We
found no significant moderating effects of intervention timing,
duration, and exercise FITT factors.
The exercise effects were significant, but small in general, and
comparable across the different subgroups. The lack of demo-
graphic and clinical moderators suggests that targeting exercise,
based on demographic and clinical characteristics may not be use-
ful for improving QoL and PF.
The moderating effects of sex, age, education, marital status,
BMI and cancer type have been explored in previous single studies
reporting inconsistent findings [11–14,27]. It has been hypothe-
sized that patients without a partner have less social support at
home [38,39] and may therefore either benefit more from the sup-
port associated with supervised or guided exercise [13,14], or may
be less likely to adhere to the exercise intervention [23]. We anal-
ysed the potential moderating effect of being married/having a
partner, although this does not necessarily reflect partner support,
and found no moderator effect on QoL and PF.
Additionally, we found no moderator effect of BMI. However,
due to the higher likelihood of sarcopenic obesity (i.e. increased
fat mass in combination with reduced muscle mass) caused by can-
cer and its treatment [40], BMI may not adequately reflect adipos-
ity in patients with cancer. Additional studies are needed to
investigate the moderator effects of muscle and fat mass.
We found no significant differences in effects on QoL and PF
across cancer types or between patients with metastatic and
non-metastatic disease. However, sample sizes of some subgroups
were small, and due to different coding schemes or lack of informa-
tion on disease stage we were limited to studying differences in
intervention

 non-metastatic disease, and were unable to further disentangle
differences in effects between patients with disease stages I, II
and III. Furthermore, the majority of studies evaluating the effects
of exercise have been conducted in patients with breast cancer,
and prostate cancer who were treated with curative intent [4,7].
Therefore exercise effects on QoL and PF remain unclear in under-
studied cancer populations, such as head and neck, lung, and
gynaecological cancers, and in patients with metastatic disease,
and they may differ from those with breast and prostate cancer
due to differences in treatment trajectories. We were unable to
confirm previous findings that radiotherapy [12] or chemotherapy
[13] moderate exercise effects, which may be related to the

 heterogeneous study population. As treatment types are related to
cancer types, the moderator effects of treatment should perhaps be
investigated separately within each cancer type.
Intervention goals are likely to differ across phases of the cancer
continuum. Exercise during cancer treatment typically seeks to
influence treatment effectiveness and coping by managing side
effects, maintaining physical fitness, and preventing muscle loss,
fat gain, fatigue, and deterioration in QoL [28]. Exercise post-
treatment typically aims to speed recovery, improve physical fit-
ness and QoL, reduce fatigue, distress and the risk of developing
chronic diseases or secondary cancers [28]. Nevertheless, the exer-
cise effects on QoL and PF were similar, and clearly demonstrate
significant benefits both during and post cancer treatment, which
is consistent with previous meta-analyses based on aggregate data
[6,8,9].
Effects of supervised exercise were twice as large as those of
unsupervised exercise, which is consistent with a previous sys-
tematic review [41]. The larger effects of supervised exercise
may be explained by the attention of the physiotherapist or exer-
cise physiologist delivering the intervention, access to better
equipment, more challenging exercise prescriptions, or by better
adherence to the prescribed exercise protocol. Reporting adher-
ence and identifying determinants of adherence to unsupervised
interventions is important to identify patients who do not need
supervision.
The lack of significant differences in exercise effects across dif-
ferent FITT factors might have resulted from little variation in these
factors across studies, or the limited power since FITT factors are
moderators at the intervention level instead of the patient level.
Previous head-to-head comparisons of exercise FITT factors indi-
cated a dose response effect of aerobic exercise on PF during cancer
treatment in patients with breast cancer [42] and larger effects of
high intensity compared to moderate intensity exercise post treat-
ment in a population with mixed cancer types [27]. More RCTs that
directly compare exercise FITT factors are warranted to define opti-
mal exercise prescriptions. Also, specific intervention components,
including goal-setting, social support and exercise instructions and
monitoring, may differ across interventions, and explain differ-
ences in effects.
The effects on QoL and PF were significant, but smaller than
expected. There may be several explanations for the smaller
effects. First, exercise interventions generally aim to improve exer-
cise behaviour or health-related physical fitness, and probably not
all dimensions of QoL (i.e. physical, emotional and social well-
being) [43] were affected to the same extent. Second, QoL is sus-
ceptible to response shift [44,45], i.e., a change in the meaning of
one’s self-evaluation of QoL over time as a result of changes in
internal standards, values and the conceptualization of QoL [46].
Third, results may have been contaminated by the adoption of
exercise by patients in the control group. The limited information
on contamination hampered us to evaluate its influence on the
effects. Fourth, our analyses were based on patients participating
in RCTs. Median (interquartile range) participation rates in exercise
trails were found to be 63% (33–80) of eligible patients [47].
Patients who decline participation may be less motivated for exer-
cise and have lower exercise levels, thus we may not reach patients
who may benefit the most. However, studies comparing exercise of
participants and non-participants found no differences [23,48,49].
Nevertheless, demographics may differ between participants and
nonparticipants, with the latter more likely to be older [48] and
to have lower education levels [23,49]. Therefore, results may not
be fully generalizable to all patients with cancer. Future IPD meta-
analyses should also study the moderator effects of baseline QoL,
PF and fitness [50], and specific symptoms as fatigue and distress
[12] and the moderator effects on other physical, psychosocial
and clinical outcomes, as they may differ [13,14].
Study strengths are the large number of included RCTs from
multiple countries, the consequent large sample size, and the uni-
form analytical procedures across all studies. Limitations are the
following: first, there was considerable publication bias in studies
that met our inclusion criteria, overestimating the intervention
effects, particularly for studies reporting on QoL. However, no sig-
nificant differences in effect sizes were found between studies pro-
viding data and those that did not, indicating that the 34 RCTs
included in the analyses were a representative sample of the pub-
lished literature. Second, not all RCTs met all quality criteria. In
particular, information on exercise adherence and contamination
was limited, hampering the ability to check whether adherence
was similar across moderator subgroups. However, a previous
review on determinants of exercise adherence in patients with
cancer concluded that the majority of studies showed no signifi-
cant association of demographic and clinical factors with adher-
ence [51]. Finally, we focused on short term intervention effects
as very few studies have examined maintenance of intervention
effects into the long term.
In conclusion, exercise, and particularly those with a supervised
component, effectively improves QoL and PF across subgroups of
patients with cancer with different demographic and clinical char-
acteristics, both during and following treatment. Although effect
sizes were small, our study provides additional evidence to support
the implementation of exercise as part of standard care to improve
QoL and PF. Current knowledge on the exercise effects on QoL and
PF is primarily based on studies in patients with non-metastasised
breast or prostate cancer. Future studies should therefore shift the
focus to understanding the exercise effects in understudied and
advanced cancer populations; on clinical outcomes including
specific symptoms, cancer treatment completion, and survival;
and on how to optimize exercise participation, adherence, and
prescriptions.
