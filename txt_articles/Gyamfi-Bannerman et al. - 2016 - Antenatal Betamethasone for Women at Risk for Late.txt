Abstract
Background—Infants born at 34 to 36 weeks’ gestation (late preterm) have greater risks of 
adverse respiratory and other outcomes, than those born at 37 weeks gestation or later. It is not 
known whether betamethasone administered to women at risk for late preterm delivery decreases 
risks of neonatal morbidities.

 Methods—We conducted a multicenter randomized trial of women with a singleton gestation at 
high risk for late preterm delivery. Participants were randomized to two injections of 12 mg 
betamethasone or matching placebo 24 hours apart. The primary outcome was a neonatal 
composite of treatment in the first 72 hours (continuous positive airway pressure or high flow 
nasal cannula for at least two hours, supplemental oxygen with a fraction of inspired oxygen of at 
least 30 percent for at least four hours, extra corporeal membrane oxygenation or mechanical 
ventilation) or stillbirth or neonatal death before 72 hours.
Results—2,831 patients were randomized. The primary outcome occurred in 11.6% of the 
betamethasone group versus 14.4%, in the placebo group (Relative Risk 0.80, 95% confidence 
interval 0.66-0.97, P=0.02). Severe respiratory morbidity, transient tachypnea of the newborn, 
surfactant use, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia were also significantly less common in the 
betamethasone group. There were no significant differences between groups in the incidence of 
chorioamnionitis or neonatal sepsis. Neonatal hypoglycemia was more common in the 
betamethasone group. (24.0% versus 14.9%, RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.38-1.88, P<0.001)
Conclusions—Administration of betamethasone to women at risk for late preterm delivery 
significantly reduced the rate of neonatal respiratory morbidity.
Antenatal corticosteroids are widely used in obstetrics for pregnancies at risk for early 
preterm delivery. Their use increased especially after a consensus conference held by the 
National Institutes of Health in 1994, which concluded that there was strong evidence that 
corticosteroids reduce adverse neonatal outcomes, including death, respiratory distress 
syndrome, and other morbidities when administered to women likely to deliver before 34 
weeks.1-3 The recommendation was not extended to women at risk for preterm delivery after 
34 weeks. This was both due to a lack of data4,5 and because it was believed that at a 
threshold of 34-35 weeks nearly all infants thrive, with survival at this gestational age being 
within 1% of survival at term.6 However, it is now clear that infants born during the ‘late’ 
preterm period (34 weeks 0 days to 36 weeks 6 days) have increased neonatal and childhood 
complications compared with newborns born at term (37 weeks or later).7-9 In that context, a 
workshop in 2005 recommended redirecting research to infants born between 34 and 36 
weeks gestation, particularly to answer the question of whether antenatal corticosteroids are 
beneficial in this population.10 Currently 8% of all deliveries occur in the late preterm 
period;11 thus the potential public health and economic impact of decreasing respiratory and 
other morbidities associated with prematurity by administration of antenatal corticosteroids 
is considerable. We therefore designed a randomized trial to assess whether administration 
of betamethasone to women likely to deliver in the late preterm period decreases respiratory 
and other neonatal morbidities.
Methods
We conducted the trial at 17 university-based clinical centers participating in the NICHD 
Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network. The protocol was approved by the 
institutional review board at each center. Written informed consent was obtained from all 
participants before randomization. The protocol is available at NEJM.org. Drs. Gyamfi-
Bannerman, Thom and Reddy take responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of 
reporting and the fidelity of the report to the study protocol.

 Screening and recruitment
Women with a live singleton pregnancy at 34 weeks 0 days to 36 weeks 5 days of gestation 
and a high probability of delivery in the late preterm period were eligible for enrollment. 
High probability of delivery was defined as either 1) preterm labor with intact membranes, 
and at least 3 cm dilation or 75% cervical effacement, or 2) spontaneous rupture of the 
membranes, or 3) if neither of these criteria applied, expected preterm delivery for any other 
indication via induction or cesarean between 24 hours to 7 days after the planned 
randomization, as determined by the obstetric provider. A woman was ineligible if she was 
expected to deliver in less than 12 hours for any reason including: 1) ruptured membranes in 
the presence of more than 6 contractions per hour or cervical dilation of 3 centimeters or 
more unless oxytocin was withheld for at least 12 hours (although other induction agents 
were allowed), 2) chorioamnionitis, 3) cervical dilation of 8 cm or more, and 4) evidence of 
non-reassuring fetal status requiring immediate delivery. A woman was also excluded if she 
had previously received antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation during this 
pregnancy, if she was a candidate for stress dose corticosteroids, if she had a 
contraindication to betamethasone, pre-gestational diabetes, or a known major fetal anomaly. 
Gestational age was determined by a standardized method across sites; if a dating ultrasound 
had not been performed before 32 weeks for a woman with known date of last menstrual 
period or before 24 weeks for those with unknown date of last menstrual period, she was 
excluded. Full eligibility criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
Study Protocol
Eligible and consenting women were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to a course of two 
intramuscular injections containing either 12 mg of betamethasone or matching placebo, 24 
hours apart. The randomization sequence was prepared by the independent data coordinating 
center according to the simple urn method,12 with stratification by clinical site and 
gestational age category (34 to 35 weeks versus 36 weeks). Each participant's supply of 
study medication was packaged according to this sequence. Neither the participants nor the 
investigators were aware of treatment assignments. During the trial, we changed the 
company manufacturing the placebo and packaging the study medication. This resulted in 
suspension of recruitment until a new company was identified.
After administration of the study medication, the women were managed clinically according 
to local practice including discharge home if delivery did not occur and the patient was 
considered stable. For those enrolled because of an indication for preterm delivery, labor 
inductions were expected to start by 36 weeks 5 days, and cesarean deliveries were to be 
scheduled by 36 weeks 6 days and not before 24 hours after randomization. Trained and 
certified research staff abstracted information from maternal and neonatal charts including 
demographic information, medical, obstetric, and social history, and outcome data. All 
infants discharged on oxygen were followed up at 28 days of age to determine whether there 
was a continuing need for oxygen supplementation.
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome was a composite endpoint describing the need for respiratory support 
by 72 hours of age consisting of one or more of the following: continuous positive airway 
Gyamfi-Bannerman et al.

 pressure (CPAP) or high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) for at least two consecutive hours, an 
oxygen requirement with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of at least 30 percent for at 
least four continuous hours, extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or the need for 
mechanical ventilation. HFNC required a flow of >1Liter/minute. Stillbirth and neonatal 
death before 72 hours of age were also included in both composite outcomes as they are 
potentially competing events. Prespecified subgroup analyses for the primary outcome and 
severe respiratory morbidity were: 34-35 versus 36 weeks gestation, indication for trial entry 
(preterm labor versus spontaneous membrane rupture versus obstetrical or medical 
indication), planned cesarean versus planned attempt at vaginal delivery at trial entry, infant 
sex, and race/ethnicity.
Neonatal secondary outcomes included: severe respiratory morbidity, a composite outcome 
defined as any of: CPAP or HFNC for at least 12 continuous hours, supplemental oxygen of 
30 percent or more for at least at least 24 continuous hours, ECMO or mechanical 
ventilation, or stillbirth or neonatal death; respiratory distress syndrome (RDS); transient 
tachypnea of the newborn ; apnea; bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD); surfactant 
administration; need for resuscitation at birth; hypoglycemia; feeding 
difficulty;hypothermia,; necrotizing enterocolitis;,,intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) Papile 
grade 3 or 4,13; neonatal sepsis; and death before discharge. RDS was defined as the 
presence of clinical signs of respiratory distress (tachypnea, retractions, flaring, grunting, or 
cyanosis), with an oxygen requirement and a chest x-ray that showed hypoaeration and 
reticulogranular infiltrates. Transient tachypnea of the newborn was diagnosed when 
tachypnea occurred in the absence of a chest X-ray, or with a chest X-ray that was normal or 
showed signs of increased perihilar interstitial markings, and resolved within 72 hours. BPD 
was defined as a supplemental oxygen requirement (FiO2 > 0.21) for the first 28 days of life. 
Maternal secondary outcomes included chorioamnionitis, endometritis, delivery prior to 
corticosteroid completion and length of stay. Definitions of all secondary outcomes are 
included in the Supplementary Appendix (Tables S7-S8).
Charts of all infants admitted to special care were centrally reviewed by a subgroup of the 
investigators and nurse coordinators to verify the respiratory outcomes. Discrepancies 
among reviewers, or between local research staff and the reviewers, were adjudicated by an 
independent neonatal consultant (LJ) who also reviewed all potential cases of BPD. All 
reviewers were blinded to treatment allocation.
Statistical Analysis
The expected rate of the primary outcome in the placebo group was estimated from a pilot 
study of infants born in the late preterm period, adjusted downward to account for the 
proportion of women at risk for late preterm delivery who deliver at term (20-40%), as 
preterm delivery cannot reliably be predicted. We estimated that a sample size of 2,800 
women would be required to detect a one third decrease in the primary outcome rate from 
9.5% in the placebo arm to 6.3% in the steroid arm, with type 1 error of 5%, 2-sided, and 
power of at least 85%. Details are in the Supplementary Appendix.
Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. We compared 
continuous variables using the Wilcoxon test and categorical variables using the chi-square

 test, and Fisher's exact test. An independent data and safety monitoring committee 
monitored the trial. A group sequential method was used to control the Type I error rate 
using the Lan-DeMets characterization of the O'Brien-Fleming boundary.14 Two interim 
analyses were performed; in the final analysis of the primary outcome, a two-tailed P value 
of less than 0.048 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Since the adjustment is 
minimal we report the 95% confidence interval for the relative risk. For all secondary 
outcomes, a nominal P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical 
significance, without adjustment for multiple comparisons; relative risks and 95% 
confidence intervals are reported. To determine whether there was a differential effect of 
betamethasone for the primary and severe respiratory composite outcomes within the pre-
specified subgroups, the Breslow–Day interaction test was conducted; where a nominal P 
value less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.
Results
Subject Characteristics
Recruitment began in October 2010 and concluded in February 2015. Of 24,538 screened 
women, 2,831 eligible subjects consented and were randomized, 1,429 participants to 
betamethasone and 1,402 to placebo (Figure 1). The most common reason for exclusion was 
delivery expected within 24 hours (6,203 women; 32%). The betamethasone and placebo 
groups were similar at baseline except for maternal age (mean 28.6 years versus 27.8 years, 
respectively, P=0.001) and the proportion of women of Hispanic ethnicity (71.6% versus 
67.9%, respectively, P=0.03, Table 1).
Compliance and Side Effects
A total of 860 (60%) women in the betamethasone group and 826 (59%) in the placebo 
group received both doses of study medication. Of those who did not receive a second dose, 
1,139 (95 %) delivered before 24 hours. Six women did not receive any of the assigned 
study medication. In the placebo arm, three women consented to the trial but subsequently 
declined the injection, one woman delivered after randomization but before the first dose, 
and one received open-label betamethasone. In the betamethasone arm, one woman was in 
active labor with complete cervical dilation when randomized. Adverse events following 
injection were more common in the placebo group than betamethasone (20.3% versus 
14.1%, P<0.001). Almost all (95%) were local reactions at the injection site (details are in 
the Supplementary Appendix (Table S4).
Neonatal Outcomes
Four women were lost to follow-up (0.14%); outcome information is available for 2,827 
neonates. There were no stillbirths or neonatal deaths within 72 hours. The primary outcome 
occurred less frequently in the betamethasone group compared with the placebo group 
(11.6% versus 14.4%; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66-0.97, P=0.02, Table 2).. The number needed to 
treat to prevent one case was 35 (95% CI 19-259). Results remained material unchanged in 
post-hoc analyses adjusting for maternal age and Hispanic ethnicity, and excluding infants 
(xx in the betamethasone group and yy in the placebo group) with congenital anomalies not 
recognized until after delivery.

 The severe respiratory morbidity composite outcome was also significantly reduced in the 
betamethasone group compared with placebo (8.1% versus 12.1%; RR 0.67, 95% CI 
0.53-0.84, P<0.001). The number needed to treat to prevent one case was 25 (95% CI 
16-56). The rates of RDS and apnea were similar between groups, but rates of transient 
tachypnea of the newborn, need for resuscitation, and BPD were significantly less frequent 
in the betamethasone group.(Table 2.).
None of the subgroup interaction tests for the primary outcome were significant. There was 
one marginally significant interaction (P=0.05) between treatment group and planned 
delivery type for the secondary severe respiratory morbidity outcome, with a significant 
reduction in the betamethasone group among those for whom a cesarean was planned at trial 
entry, but not those planning a vaginal delivery attempt. (Supplementary Appendix, Tables 
S9-S10).
Two infants (both in the betamethasone group) died before neonatal discharge,: one death 
was due to septic shock and the other to structural cardiac anomaly and arrhythmia. There 
were no significant differences between groups in gestational age at delivery, the frequency 
of small-for-gestational-age neonates, or rates of neonatal sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, 
or intraventricular hemorrhage (Table 3). As compared with Infants in the placebo group, 
infants in the betamethasone group were less likely to spend three or more days in the 
intensive or intermediate care nursery (P=0.03) and had a shorter time to first feed, but had a 
higher incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia (24.0% vs. 14.9%; RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.38-1.99, 
P< 0.001). Additional analyses of secondary outcomes are in the Supplementary Appendix 
Tables S7-S8.
Maternal Outcomes
There were no significant differences between groups in the incidence of chorioamnionitis 
or endometritis. The rates of cesarean delivery, time to delivery, and length of stay were also 
similar between groups (Table 4).
Serious Adverse Events—Serious maternal adverse events occurred in 10 women in the 
betamethasone group and 12 in the placebo group (Supplemental appendix table xx). Serious 
adverse neonatal events occurred in 4 infants in the betamethasone group (in addition to the 
2 deaths, one infant had reflux and one had thrombocytopenia) and 1 (supraventricular 
tachycardia) in the placebo group.
Discussion
This randomized multicenter trial demonstrated that antenatal administration of 
betamethasone to women at risk for late preterm delivery decreased the need for significant 
respiratory support during the first 72 hours of life. Betamethasone administration also 
resulted in a lower frequency of severe respiratory morbidity and BPD, less need for 
surfactant, and a reduction in prolonged stays in a special care nursery. Administration of 
betamethasone did not significantly affect peripartum maternal or neonatal infection rates, 
but increased the rate of neonatal hypoglycemia.

 Our findings are consistent with the results of the ASTECS trial (Antenatal Steroids for 
Term Caesarean Section), in which women were randomized to receive or not to receive 
antenatal corticosteroids at the time of elective cesarean delivery at term. There was a 
significant reduction in neonatal intensive care admission for respiratory morbidity in the 
betamethasone group (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.23-0.93).15 Treatment with betamethasone for 
patients undergoing a scheduled cesarean delivery at term has since become the standard of 
care in the UK.
Two smaller randomized trials have specifically assessed the use of betamethasone in the 
late preterm period to prevent adverse neonatal respiratory outcomes.16,17 However, these 
studies were inconclusive as they were underpowered,17 had substantial loss to follow-up,16 
and had post-randomization exclusions.17
We found that infants exposed to antenatal betamethasone had a higher rate of neonatal 
hypoglycemia defined as glucose <40mg/dL. We did not collect data on actual blood sugar 
concentrations. However, there were no reported adverse events related to hypoglycemia, 
and the rates of neonatal intensive or intermediate care admission were similar between 
groups. Additionally, the betamethasone group was less likely to have prolonged (>3d) 
NICU stays, suggesting the transient nature of the hypoglycemia. Few trials of antenatal 
corticosteroids have included information on neonatal hypoglycemia;4 however the original 
trial of antenatal corticosteroids found no significant difference in rates of neonatal 
hypoglycemia between groups.18 Nevertheless, our data support monitoring neonatal blood 
glucose after antenatal betamethasone exposure in the late preterm period.
Our study protocol did not allow the use of other prenatal interventions, such as tocolysis, 
thereby supporting that the difference in the occurrence of the primary outcome was due to 
antenatal corticosteroid administration. Although we delayed augmentation of labor via 
oxytocin by 12 hours for women with ruptured membranes who were experiencing 
contractions or whose cervical dilation was 3 cm or more, we did not find a significant 
difference in the rates of maternal or neonatal infectious morbidity between groups.
The challenges in predicting the timing of delivery are demonstrated by the fact that, despite 
inclusion and exclusion criteria designed to identify those women most likely to deliver 24 
hours to 7 days after betamethasone administration, only 60% of participants received two 
doses of study medication. These eventualities would likely have reduced the effect of 
betamethasone, suggesting that the observed between group differences may underestimate 
effects if both doses were received.
In conclusion, the administration of antenatal betamethasone administration for women at 
risk for late preterm delivery significantly decreased the rate of respiratory complications in 
newborns. Betamethasone administration significantly increased the rate of neonatal 
hypoglycemia, but not other maternal or neonatal complications

*Primary outcome is defined as any of the following in the first 72 hours: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or high flow nasal cannula 
(HFNC) for ≥ 2 continuous hours; oxygen requirement with FiO2 of ≥30% for ≥4 continuous hours; mechanical ventilation; neonatal death; or 
stillbirth or need for ECMO
**Severe respiratory morbidity is defined as any of the following in the first 72 hours: CPAP or HFNC for ≥ 12 hours; oxygen requirement with 
FIO2 ≥ 30% for ≥24 hours, mechanical ventilation, neonatal death; or stillbirth or need for ECMO.
