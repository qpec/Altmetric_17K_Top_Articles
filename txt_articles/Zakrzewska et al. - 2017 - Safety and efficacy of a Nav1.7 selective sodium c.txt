Abstract: Background: Current standard of care for trigeminal neuralgia is treatment with the sodium
channel blockers carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, which although effective are associated with poor
tolerability and the need for titration.
BIIB074, a Nav1.7-selective, state-dependent sodium-channel
blocker, can be administered at therapeutic doses without titration, and has shown good tolerability in
healthy individuals in phase 1 studies. We therefore assessed the safety and efficacy of BIIB074 in patients
with trigeminal neuralgia in a phase 2a study. Methods: We did a double-blind, multicentre, placebo-
controlled, randomised withdrawal phase 2a trial in 25 secondary care centres in Denmark, Estonia,
France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK. After
a 7-day run-in phase, eligible patients aged 18–80 years with confirmed trigeminal neuralgia received open-
label, BIIB074 150 mg three times per day, orally, for 21 days. Patients who met at least one response
criteria were then randomly assigned (1:1) to BIIB074 or placebo for up to 28 days in a double-blind phase.
We used an interactive web response system to assign patients with a computer-generated schedule, with
stratification (presence or absence of existing pain medication). Patients, clinicians, and assessors were
masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the difference between groups in the number
of patients classified as treatment failure during the double blind phase assessed in the modified intention-
to-treat population. We assessed safety in all patients who received one or more doses of BIIB074. This
study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01540630) and EudraCT (2010-023963-16). Findings:
The first patient was enrolled on April 23, 2012, and the last patient completed the study on February
26, 2014. We enrolled 67 patients into the open-label phase; 44 completed open-label treatment, and
29 were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment (15 to BIIB074 and 14 to placebo). During the
double-blind phase, five (33%) patients assigned to BIIB074 versus nine (64%) assigned to placebo were
classified as treatment failures (p=0·0974). BIIB074 was well tolerated, with similar adverse events
in the double-blind phase to placebo.
Headache was the most common adverse event with BIIB074
in the open-label phase (in 13 [19%] of 67 patients), followed by dizziness (in six [9%] patients). In
the double-blind phase, headache, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, sleep disorder, and tremor were the most
frequent adverse events in patients assigned to BIIB074 (in one [7%] of 15 patients for each event), and
headache, dizziness, diarrhoea, and vomiting were the most frequent adverse events in patients assigned
to placebo (in one [7%] of 14 patients for each event). No severe or serious adverse events were reported
in the BIIB074 group during the double-blind phase. One patient assigned to placebo reported intestinal
adhesions with obstruction as a severe and serious adverse event, which was considered as unrelated to
study medication. Interpretation: The primary endpoint of treatment failure was not significantly lower
in the BIIB074 group than in the placebo group. However, our findings provide a basis for continued
investigation of BIIB074 in patients with trigeminal neuralgia in future clinical trials.

Summary 
Word count (Max=300): 358 
Background: Current standard of care for trigeminal neuralgia is treatment with the sodium 
channel blockers carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine. Unlike these drugs, BIIB074 
(CNV1014802), a novel Nav1.7-selective, state-dependent sodium channel blocker, can be 
administered at immediate therapeutic doses and has shown good tolerability in healthy 
individuals in phase 1 studies. We therefore assessed the safety and efficacy of BIIB074 in 
trigeminal neuralgia. 
Methods: This phase 2a, double-blind withdrawal trial was conducted in 25 secondary care 
centres in the UK, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Switzerland, South Africa, France, Spain, 
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Romania. After a 7-day run-in, patients aged 18–80 years 
with classical trigeminal neuralgia received open-label BIIB074 150-mg three times a day for 
21 days. Patients meeting response criteria at the end of the open-label phase were 
randomised to BIIB074 or placebo in a 28-day double-blind phase. Patients, clinicians, and 
assessors were masked to treatment allocation, with tablets for study drug and placebo 
identical in appearance and packaging. Primary endpoint was the proportion meeting 
treatment failure criteria with BIIB074 versus placebo during the double-blind phase in the 
modified intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT01540630) and EudraCT (2010-023963-16). 
Findings: The first patient was enrolled on April 23, 2012, and the last patient completed the 
study on Feb 26, 2014. Sixty-seven patients entered the open-label phase; 44 completed 
open-label treatment, and 29 were randomised and received double-blind treatment (n=15 
BIIB074, n=14 placebo). During the double-blind phase, five (33%) BIIB074 versus nine 
(64%) placebo patients were classified as treatment failures (one-sided p=0.0974). BIIB074 
was well-tolerated, with double-blind phase adverse events similar to placebo. There were 
no severe or serious AEs reported in the BIIB074 group during the double-blind phase. One 
patient on placebo (7%) reported a severe AE which also reported as a serious adverse 
event (intestinal adhesions with obstruction), considered as unrelated to study medication.

 TN Phase 2 
 
 
Interpretation: The primary endpoint of this trial did not reach statistical significance; 
however, fewer patients treated with BIIB074 were classified as treatment failures compared 
with placebo. We believe that our findings provide a basis for continued investigation of 
BIIB074 in trigeminal neuralgia.

Panel: Research in context 
Evidence before this study 
Based on a search of PubMed (search terms ‘trigeminal neuralgia’, June 1 2005-June 16 
2015, English-language) and the authors’ own publications, we identified the following 
comprehensive systematic reviews of the evidence base for drug treatments in trigeminal 
neuralgia: Cochrane reviews by Wiffen et al (2014), Zhang et al (2013) and Wiffen et al 
(2013), a Clinical Evidence review (Zakrzewska and Linskey 2014), and international clinical 
guidelines (Cruccu 2008). The individual publications report their search strategy. Overall, 
this literature highlights a lack of high quality clinical trials in trigeminal neuralgia. Current 
standard of care and guideline-recommended first-line treatment is with the sodium channel 
blockers carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, but even for these drugs the evidence base is 
weak (‘third-tier’ evidence only for carbamazepine and no eligible studies for oxcarbazepine, 
per Cochrane reviews). Further, these treatments are limited by poor tolerability, need for 
well-managed titration, and potential for pharmacological interactions. 
 
Added value of this study 
Few advances have been made in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia in recent decades 
and high-quality clinical trials have been lacking. This study was designed to address 
barriers to the conduct of traditional randomised controlled trials in the trigeminal neuralgia 
population, by utilizing a randomised withdrawal design that limits the exposure of patients to 
placebo in the absence of benefit. The results of this study indicate potential for BIIB074, a 
novel Nav1.7-selective sodium channel blocker, to be both effective and well-tolerated in 
trigeminal neuralgia patients. Notably, in contrast to carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine, BIIB074 
was associated with low rates of cognitive impairment, and can be administered without 
titration to therapeutic doses. 
 
Implications of all the available evidence

 TN Phase 2 
 
 
To our knowledge, BIIB074 is unique in being developed with trigeminal neuralgia as 
the primary indication. If successful, the programme could lead to the first US Food and Drug 
Administration approval for trigeminal neuralgia since the introduction of carbamazepine in 
the 1960s. We believe that our results provide a basis for the continued investigation of 
BIIB074 in trigeminal neuralgia.

Introduction 
Trigeminal neuralgia is a rare and at times debilitating orofacial disorder, characterised by 
unilateral paroxysms of severe pain in the territory innervated by the trigeminal nerve, 
usually triggered by innocuous stimuli.1 Currently, the only US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)-approved treatment for trigeminal neuralgia is the voltage-gated sodium channel 
(Nav) blocker carbamazepine, which was approved for this disorder in the 1960s. 
Carbamazepine and its analogue oxcarbazepine are recommended as first-line treatments 
for trigeminal neuralgia.2 However, although generally considered effective, these treatments 
are limited by poor tolerability, need for well managed titration, and potential for 
pharmacological interactions.2-5 Other oral drugs (predominantly anticonvulsants) have been 
investigated in trigeminal neuralgia; however, none has shown a clear benefit.2, 6-8 Cochrane 
reviews have highlighted that overall few high-quality clinical trials in trigeminal neuralgia 
have been done, and even for carbamazepine, the evidence base is weak.3, 6, 7 A recent 
systematic review indicated that botulinum toxin is effective in trigeminal neuralgia; however, 
randomised controlled trials were not identified that evaluated duration of effect beyond 3 
months.9 
Nav1.7 is a sodium channel that is preferentially expressed in peripheral neurons, 
including trigeminal neurons, and results from functional and genetic studies suggest a link 
between Nav1.7 and pain signalling in humans.10-12 Loss-of-function mutations in Nav1.7 are 
associated with insensitivity to pain in individuals who are apparently cognitively healthy,13 
suggesting Nav1.7 as a potential target for pain. Efficacy of the Nav blockers carbamazepine 
(known to block Nav1.714) and oxcarbazepine lends further support for Nav1.7 as a target in 
trigeminal neuralgia. 
BIIB074 (CNV1014802) is a novel Nav1.7-selective, state-dependent sodium channel 
blocker15, 16 under investigation for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. Electrophysiological 
studies have shown that BIIB074 preferentially inhibits higher frequencies of firing17 such as 
would be expected in the paroxysms of pain in trigeminal neuralgia.18, 19 Results from phase 
6 
 
 
 TN Phase 2 
 
 
1 studies suggest that BIIB074 has good tolerability in healthy individuals and can be 
administered at therapeutic doses without lengthy titration (unpublished). Thus, if proven 
efficacious, BIIB074 could fill an unmet need for a trigeminal neuralgia treatment that is both 
effective and well tolerated, particularly because many patients opt to remain on medications 
rather than undergo neurosurgical procedures.4 
We assessed the safety and efficacy of BIIB074 in classical trigeminal neuralgia in a 
phase 2a withdrawal trial.20 
 
Methods 
Study design and patients 
This trial was a phase 2a, placebo-controlled, multicentre, double-blind, randomised 
withdrawal study (figure S1). The full study design has been published previously, prior to 
completion of the study.20 
The study was conducted in 25 international secondary care centres with a special 
interest in headache and facial pain (across the UK, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Switzerland, 
South Africa, France, Spain, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Romania). Patients were 
identified from databases held at the study centres and by advertising through patient 
support groups, and were recruited directly from specialised headache and facial pain 
clinics. All patients provided written informed consent. The study protocol, patient 
information, informed consent forms, and amendments, were reviewed and approved by 
relevant independent ethics committees or institutional review boards, and the study was 
conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation principles of 
Good Clinical Practice and principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. 
Adults aged 18–80 years (increased from 70 years in a protocol amendment, May-
August 2012, detailed in online appendix) meeting criteria for classical trigeminal neuralgia 
based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) were included in the 
study.1, 20, 21 Each clinical diagnosis was additionally verified by the trial’s data monitoring 
committee (DMC), and confirmed prior to entry into the treatment phase. Protocol criteria for 
7 
 
 
 TN Phase 2 
 
 
classical trigeminal neuralgia were based on the ICHD Second Edition; however, the DMC 
also considered criteria of the Third Edition published in 2013.1, 21 Patients had undergone 
imaging to ensure no secondary cause was present, and were also excluded if there were 
signs of dental causes, autonomic symptoms, or other neuropathic pain. Following 
screening, patients were enrolled in a 7-day run-in period, during which the patients 
recorded number and severity of paroxysms of pain on a paper diary and completed a 
washout of prohibited medications. To be eligible for inclusion in the open-label phase, 
patients had to have at least three paroxysms of pain per day, each rated at intensity ≥4 on a 
pain intensity numerical rating scale (PI-NRS) on at least 4 days during run-in. Further 
details of the essential criteria for diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia and other 
inclusion/exclusion criteria are reported in the appendix and in the published protocol.20 
Following run-in, eligible patients initially entered a 21-day open-label treatment 
phase, during which they received open-label BIIB074 150 mg orally three-times daily (tid) 
for 21 days with no upward titration. On Day 21, response criteria were assessed to 
determine eligibility for a 28-day double-blind phase. Eligibility was determined on the basis 
of meeting at least one of the following criteria: ≥30% decrease in the number of paroxysms 
of pain over the last 7 days of open-label compared with 7-day run-in; ≥30% reduction in 
severity of paroxysms of pain over the last 7 days of open-label compared with 7-day run-in; 
or a Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) rating of much improved or very much 
improved. 
Patients entering the double-blind phase were randomised to BIIB074 150 mg tid or 
placebo. During the double-blind phase, patients meeting criteria for treatment failure were 
to be withdrawn from treatment. Treatment failure was determined on the basis of meeting at 
least one of the following criteria: more than three paroxysms in a 7-day period and either a 
≥50% increase in the frequency of paroxysms, or a ≥50% increase in the severity of 
paroxysms, compared to the final 7 days of open-label; PGIC rating of much worse or very 
much worse (relative to the end of the open-label phase); or the patient discontinued 
because of ‘lack of efficacy’ (as defined and reported by the patient or clinician), or due to an 
8 
 
 
 TN Phase 2 
 
 
adverse reaction or poor tolerability considered to be related to the study medication. 
Following cessation of double-blind treatment, patients returned for a follow-up visit after 7 
days to ascertain their level of pain. 
Patients were not permitted to use other sodium channel blockers during the study. 
BIIB074 is a potent, reversible monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor; therefore, medications 
that could adversely interact with an MAO-B inhibitor (including other MAO inhibitors) were 
also excluded. Further details of prohibited medications are provided in the appendix. 
Permitted concomitant medications for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia had to have 
been stable for ≥3 weeks prior to the start of open-label treatment and maintained at stable 
dose. 
 
Randomisation and masking 
Patients were randomised in the double-blind phase (1:1 to BIIB074 or placebo) according to 
a computer-generated, centralised randomisation schedule. Patients were allocated to 
treatment through an interactive web response system accessed by the site, and medication 
was dispensed from a pharmacy that had no input into patient care. The randomisation 
schedule was stratified by whether or not the patient was taking existing pain medication. 
Patients, clinicians, and assessors were masked to treatment allocation, with tablets for 
study drug and placebo identical in appearance and packaging. Masking was assessed by 
asking patients and clinicians to guess which treatment had been administered at the end of 
double-blind treatment. The primary outcome was assessed centrally. 
 
Procedures 
During the open-label phase, all patients were required to take one tablet of BIIB074 150 mg 
(film-coated, immediate release) orally three-times per day for 21 days. During the double-
blind phase, patients took one tablet of BIIB074 150 mg or matching placebo orally three-
times per day for up to 28 days. Tablets had to be taken at least 1 hour before or after food 
and approximately 8 hours apart.

 TN Phase 2 
 
 
Patients were asked to record the number of spontaneous or evoked paroxysms of 
pain experienced per 24-hour period, and the severity of each paroxysm, on a paper diary 
card. Severity of paroxysms was rated by the patients on an 11-point PI-NRS from 0 to 10, 
where 0 represents “no pain” and 10 “maximum pain imaginable”. Patients were also asked 
to rate pain intensity averaged over the last 24 hours before retiring to bed (average daily 
pain score), also recorded using the 11-point PI-NRS) (figure S2). Patient Global Impression 
of Change (PGIC) and Clinician Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scales were used by 
the patient and clinician, respectively, to record their opinion of the change in overall status 
according to a 7-point NRS (1 representing “very much improved” and 7 “very much worse”). 
The PGIC and CGIC were completed at the end of open-label treatment relative to run-in, 
and at the end of the double-blind phase or premature discontinuation relative to end of the 
open-label phase. Patients were also asked to complete the Brief Pain Inventory-Facial (BPI-
F),22 at the start and end of open-label treatment, and at the end of double-blind treatment or 
premature discontinuation. However, data for BPI-F were collected incompletely and are 
therefore not reported. 
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analyses were collected pre-dose on day 0, and 
pre-dose and 2 h post-dose on days 7, 21, 35, and 49 (or premature discontinuation). 
 
Outcomes 
The primary endpoint was treatment failure during the double-blind phase. Secondary 
endpoints were the number (mean number per day calculated over the previous week) and 
severity of paroxysms (mean severity across all paroxysms in the previous week), average 
daily pain score (mean of average daily pain over the previous week), PGIC and CGIC 
scores, and BPI-F (not reported), for the open-label and double-blind phases.20 
Safety was assessed by monitoring of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, and laboratory safety tests (including clinical 
chemistry, haematology and urinalysis). Adverse events (either volunteered spontaneously 
10 
 
 
 TN Phase 2 
 
 
by patients or in response to general, non-leading questioning by the investigator) were 
recorded from the start of treatment on Day 0 until the final follow-up visit. 
Pharmacokinetic assessments included the measurement of plasma BIIB074 
concentrations pre-dose and 2 h post-dose, with estimation of maximum (Cmax-ss) and 
minimum (Cmin-ss) concentrations and exposure (area under curve 0-24 h [AUC0-24-ss]) at 
steady state. 
 
Statistical analysis 
Up to 70 patients were to be recruited into the open-label phase in order to randomise 30 
into the double-blind phase. Based on assumptions that 20% of patients on BIIB074 and 
67% on placebo would meet criteria for treatment failure (defined under ‘Study design and 
patient population’) during double-blind treatment, with 11 evaluable patients per treatment 
arm (22 in total) during the double-blind phase, the study had 80% power to demonstrate a 
statistically significant improvement with BIIB074 over placebo, using a one-sided test at the 
5% level of significance. 
The modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population included all patients randomised 
into the double-blind phase of the study who received at least one dose of double-blind 
medication (pre-specified population for the primary analysis). The safety population 
included all patients who received one or more doses of BIIB074. Patients experiencing 
treatment failure were withdrawn from study treatment, and assessments subsequent to 
failure were excluded from statistical analyses. All statistical tests were one-sided (assessing 
improvement with BIIB074 vs placebo) and performed at the 5% level of significance. No 
adjustments were made for multiplicity.  
The primary analysis compared the number of treatment failures with BIIB074 versus 
placebo in the mITT population using Fisher's exact test. Secondary efficacy analyses with 
the primary endpoint included treatment failures by week and time to treatment failure. Time 
to treatment failure was plotted using Kaplan-Meier curves and treatment groups were 
compared using the log-rank test. The secondary endpoints relating to paroxysms (number 
11 
 
 
 TN Phase 2 
 
 
and severity of paroxysms, and average daily pain score) were analysed using general 
estimating equation (GEE) linear regression models (compound symmetry covariance 
structure and log-link function). The change in each endpoint over 4 weeks of treatment was 
estimated and compared between groups. The PGIC and CGIC scores were analysed using 
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Changes from baseline were summarised, with baseline taken 
as run-in for the open-label period and Day 21 (end of open-label) for the double-blind 
period. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using non-linear mixed effect 
methodology and prior pharmacokinetic knowledge of the compound. 
Post-hoc analyses were also conducted for: 1) percentage change from baseline in 
number of paroxysms of pain at the end of the double-blind phase, 2) change from baseline 
in paroxysm severity at the end of the double-blind phase, and 3) change from baseline in 
average daily pain score at the end of the double-blind phase. For each endpoint, the run-in 
week was taken as baseline and two approaches were used for imputing data: last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) and baseline observation carried forward (BOCF). 
Comparisons were made between treatment groups using analysis of covariance. We note 
that all methods of dealing with missing values have their limitations,23 and it is debated 
whether BOCF and LOCF are good estimates for the missing values; they are also criticized 
for being single value imputations, and hence underestimate the variability of treatment 
comparisons. Unfortunately other methods, such as multiple imputation analysis, are likely to 
have been problematic with the small sample size in this study.  
Additionally, the proportion of patients with ≥50% reduction in each of these 
measures (number of paroxysms, severity of paroxysms, and average daily pain score) was 
calculated for each treatment group (a 50% threshold was selected as commonly accepted 
in the pain literature as reflective of an effective treatment24). Additional details of statistical 
analyses are included in the appendix. All analyses were conducted using SAS (version 
9.1.3 or later).  
The DMC reviewed the data after the first 10 patients had completed the open-label 
phase. This review did not involve an interim analysis of the primary endpoint and therefore 
12 
 
 
 TN Phase 2 
 
 
had no impact on the statistical properties of the study. Details concerning the purpose of the 
review are included in the appendix. Important changes to the protocol during the study are 
also detailed in the appendix.  
 
This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01540630) and EudraCT (2010-023963-
16).

Results 
The first patient was enrolled in the study on April 23, 2012, and the last patient completed 
on February 26, 2014. Overall, 125 patients were screened (primarily to ensure medical 
fitness), and the diagnostic committee reviewed the trigeminal neuralgia diagnosis for 104 
(all those not reviewed were screen failures). The diagnostic committee confirmed the 
diagnosis in 97 patients; 7 patients from 4 sites were excluded as they did not fulfil the 
criteria set by the DMC (figure 1). A total of 67 patients entered the open-label phase, all of 
whom had a confirmed diagnosis prior to entry.  
Forty-four (66%) of 67 patients completed the open-label phase. Of these patients, 
30 met the randomisation criteria and were randomised to the double-blind phase, but one 
was withdrawn prior to dosing because study medication was mislaid at the study site and 
could not be dispensed. The mITT population therefore included 29 patients who received 
treatment (n=15 BIIB074, n=14 placebo) (figure 1).  
The median age of the overall open-label population (n=67) was 60.0 years (range 
21-79 years) and 65.7% were female. Median duration of trigeminal neuralgia was 6.0 years, 
and median number of previous therapies was two. Characteristics were similar between 
13 
 
 
 TN Phase 2 
 
 
treatment groups in the double-blind phase, except for a slightly higher proportion of females 
in the BIIB074 group (table 1). 98.5% of patients had received at least one prior medication 
for trigeminal neuralgia on entering the study; only one patient was drug naïve. Sodium 
channel blockers were the most commonly used; 74.6% had used carbamazepine (median 
daily dose 600 mg), and 28.4% oxcarbazepine (median daily dose 900 mg), during their 
lifetime. Gabapentin had been used by 31.3% (median daily dose 1050 mg) (table 1).  
At the time of screening, 50.7% were receiving carbamazepine, and 22.4% 
oxcarbazepine, and had these medications stopped prior to the open-label phase (table 1). 
Overall, 26.9% of patients took at least one concomitant medication for trigeminal neuralgia 
during study treatment. Among patients in the double-blind population, 33.3% (n=5 of 15) in 
the BIIB074 group and 28.6% (n=4 of 14) in the placebo group reported one or more 
concomitant medication. In all cases, the most common medication was gabapentin (19.4% 
open-label, 26.7% BIIB074 double-blind, and 21.4% placebo double-blind) (table 1).  
During the double-blind phase, fewer patients receiving BIIB074 experienced 
treatment failure (n=5 of 15; 33.3%) than with placebo (n=9 of 14; 64.3%); however, the 
difference between groups was not statistically significant (one-sided p=0.0974 primary 
endpoint). A breakdown of patients meeting individual treatment failure criteria during the 
double-blind phase is reported in the appendix (table S2). The majority of treatment failures 
occurred in the first 2 weeks of double-blind treatment (data not shown). 
The median time to treatment failure during the double-blind phase was significantly 
longer with BIIB074 than placebo (one-sided p=0.0306; figure 2). For BIIB074, less than 
50% experienced treatment failure, and thus a median time to failure was not reached (NR; 
95% CI 7.0, NR). In the placebo group, the median time to treatment failure was 14.0 days 
(95% CI 1.0, NR). 
During run-in, patients in the mITT population experienced a median of 7.9 (range 
2.4 to 51.0) paroxysms per day, mean severity of paroxysms of 5.7 (SD 1.47), and mean 
average daily pain score of 5.7 (SD 1.61). At the end of the open-label phase, these 
measures were reduced to a median of 3.9 (range 0–39.6) paroxysms per day, mean 
14 
 
 
 TN Phase 2 
 
 
severity of paroxysms of 2.8 (SD 2.19) points, and mean average daily pain score of 2.6 (SD 
2.17). A GEE model comparing reductions during double-blind treatment with BIIB074 
relative to placebo estimated a 45% placebo-adjusted reduction in the number of paroxysms 
(95% CI -2%, 70%; one-sided p=0.028), a 26% placebo-adjusted reduction in severity of 
paroxysms (95% CI -13%, 51%; one-sided p=0.0846), and a 50% placebo-adjusted 
reduction in average daily pain score (95% CI 23%, 67%; one-sided p=0.0009). 
In a post-hoc analysis (BOCF), the number of paroxysms was reduced by a mean of 
53% from run-in to the end of double-blind treatment in the BIIB074 group compared with 
21% in the placebo group (placebo-adjusted change -32%, 95% CI -64%, 1%). Severity of 
paroxysms was reduced by a mean of 2.49 points with BIIB074 compared with 1.13 with 
placebo (placebo-adjusted change -1.35, 95% CI -3.06, 0.35). The mean reduction in 
average daily pain score was 3.05 in the BIIB074 group and 0.74 in the placebo group 
(placebo-adjusted change -2.31, 95% CI -3.78, -0.83). Figure 3 plots the mean percentage 
change in these pain measures from run-in across the course of the study (BOCF). We 
report BOCF data as we believe the most reasonable assumption is that pain levels return to 
baseline on cessation of treatment (BOCF was also recommended for randomised 
withdrawal trials in a recent systematic review25), but analysis by LOCF showed similar 
results (data not shown). 
An additional post-hoc analysis evaluated the percentage of patients experiencing a 
≥50% reduction in number of paroxysms, severity of paroxysms, or average daily pain score 
from run-in to the end of the double-blind phase. The number of paroxysms was reduced by 
≥50% for 60.0% (n=9 of 15) of the BIIB074 group compared with 21.4% (n=3 of 14) of the 
placebo group, and severity of paroxysms was reduced by ≥50% for 46.7% (n=7 of 15) 
receiving BIIB074 compared with 14.3% (n=2 of 14) receiving placebo. A ≥50% reduction in 
average daily pain score was experienced by 60.0% (n=9 of 15) in the BIIB074 group 
compared with 14.3% (n=2 of 14) in the placebo group. 
All patients in the mITT population had improvement (minimally improved, much 
improved or very much improved) according to CGIC during the open-label phase (n=29 of 
15 
 
 
 TN Phase 2 
 
 
29; 100.0%), and all but one had improvement on the PGIC (n=28 of 29; 96.6%). At the end 
of double-blind treatment, CGIC indicated further improvement relative to Day 21 for 80.0% 
(n=12 of 15) of BIIB074 patients versus 35.7% (n=5 of 14) of placebo patients. The 
proportion of patients reporting improvement in PGIC was 73.3% (n=11 of 15) in the BIIB074 
group versus 50.0% (n=7 of 14) in the placebo group. One-sided p-values from Wilcoxon 
exact tests, using data over the whole scale, were 0.0051 and 0.0265 for CGIC and PGIC, 
respectively, for BIIB074 vs placebo. 
During the open-label phase, 37 of 67 (55.2%) patients reported a total of 139 AEs 
(68 considered treatment-related [includes unknown, probable, possible, or definite 
causality]). During the double-blind phase, 4 of 15 (26.7%) patients in the BIIB074 group 
reported 13 treatment-emergent AEs (new AEs or worsening of AEs from the open-label 
phase) (seven treatment-related), and 5 of 14 (35.7%) in the placebo group reported 17 
treatment-emergent AEs (5 treatment-related). Only 8 of 152 (5.3%) AE events while 
receiving BIIB074 were considered severe, experienced by 5 patients receiving BIIB074 
during open label treatment. For 3 of these patients, the AEs (trigeminal neuralgia pain [also 
reported as a serious adverse event (SAE)], worsening of trigeminal neuralgia, and 
headache [verbatim terms]) were considered by the investigator to be unrelated to BIIB074. 
Severe AEs of headache, extremely decreased skin turgor, and extremely dry mouth 
reported for one patient during open-label treatment with BIIB074 were all considered 
probably related to study treatment. One patient had 2 severe events of dizziness that were 
also considered probably related to treatment with BIIB074. One patient randomised to 
placebo had a severe AE of intestinal adhesions with obstruction (reported as an SAE) 
shortly after discontinuing double-blind treatment due to lack of efficacy. The event was 
considered unrelated to study treatment.  
In addition to the two SAEs described above (trigeminal neuralgia pain and intestinal 
adhesions), an SAE of food poisoning with Escherichia coli was reported during open-label 
treatment, which was not considered to be treatment-related. Five patients had treatment 
withdrawn or interrupted due to AEs, including two of the patients with SAEs (trigeminal 
16 
 
 
 TN Phase 2 
 
 
neuralgia pain and Escherichia coli – the patients were subsequently withdrawn from the 
study due to lack of efficacy and withdrawal of consent), and the patient with severe AEs of 
decreased skin turgor and dry mouth, during open-label treatment. Two additional patients 
with AEs of hypertension (probably related) and dyspnoea (unrelated) during the open-label 
phase were withdrawn due to these AEs. No patients discontinued due to AEs during the 
double-blind phase. The most common AEs reported during the open-label and double-blind 
phases (≥3.0% overall incidence) are listed in table 2, with very few relating to impaired 
cognitive functioning. There were no clinically significant AEs in relation to laboratory safety 
tests (including urea and electrolytes and liver function tests), vital signs, or ECG. 
BIIB074 steady state plasma concentrations and exposures were as expected from 
the prior studies in healthy volunteers. Estimated individual Cmin-ss and Cmax-ss values 
suggested that plasma concentrations with BIIB074 150 mg tid remained between 
approximately 0.5 and 2.7 μg/mL, without obvious differences between randomisation 
groups or periods. The estimated steady state exposures corresponded to an estimated 
mean Cmax of 2 μg/mL and mean AUC0-24 of 36 μg.h/ml. 
During assessment of masking at the end of double-blind treatment, 66.7% of 
patients (n=10 of 15) and clinicians for 73.3% of patients (n=11 of 15) in the BIIB074 group 
guessed their treatment allocation correctly. In the placebo group, patients and clinicians 
each guessed correctly for 71.4% of patients (n=10 of 14). It should be noted that these 
assessments are probably influenced by effects of the drug on pain and AEs. 
 
Discussion 
Fewer patients treated with the Nav1.7 blocker BIIB074 had treatment failures, the primary 
endpoint of the study, than those given placebo in the double-blind phase of the study, but 
the difference was not statistically significant. Statistically significant treatment differences 
were observed versus placebo in important secondary endpoints during the double-blind 
phase, including time to treatment failure, number of paroxysms, average daily pain score, 
17 
 
 
 TN Phase 2 
 
 
PGIC, and CGIC. While firm conclusions on efficacy and safety cannot be drawn from this 
study, the results provide a basis for continued study. 
BIIB074 at a dose of 150 mg tid was well-tolerated in this study, with few severe AEs 
or withdrawals due to AEs. During the double-blind phase, the incidence of AEs was similar 
with both BIIB074 and placebo. The most common AEs in the open-label phase were 
headache and dizziness, occurring in 19.4% and 9.0% of patients, respectively. This 
incidence might reasonably be expected in any population. In the double-blind phase, no AE 
(new or worsening from open-label) occurred in more than one patient. While direct 
comparisons with AE percentages for other drugs cannot be made, overall the tolerability 
profile appears promising relative to carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and other 
anticonvulsants used in trigeminal neuralgia, which exhibit high rates of cognitive and other 
central nervous system (CNS) events.3-5, 7, 26-28 In contrast, BIIB074 was associated with low 
rates of these AEs, and in particular cognitive impairment and drowsiness. Further 
evaluation of the AE profile of BIIB074 relative to carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine will be 
important. Given the good tolerability profile of BIIB074, it may also be possible to increase 
the dose to determine if efficacy could be improved. Indeed, higher doses have been 
evaluated in Phase 1 studies and a Phase 2 trial in patients with painful lumbosacral 
radiculopathy, and the AE profile was broadly similar to the current study (unpublished; 
ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT00908154, NCT00955396 (Phase 1); NCT01561027 
[Phase 2]). 
Pain in trigeminal neuralgia is thought to arise from abnormal action potential 
discharges from trigeminal ganglion neurons.18, 19 Aligning with the promising clinical results, 
in vitro electrophysiological studies (shown in the online appendix, page 3 and figure S3) 
show an inhibitory effect of BIIB074 on the excitability of trigeminal ganglion neurons, 
including a reduction in high-frequency firing. Of particular note, the maximum serum 
concentration of BIIB074 observed in the present trial and another Phase 2 study in painful 
lumbosacral radiculopathy (unpublished; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01561027) was in 
the same order of magnitude as the lower concentration tested in electrophysiology studies 
18 
 
 
 TN Phase 2 
 
 
(1 µmol/L), indicating the clinical relevance of this dose. We cannot exclude a contribution of 
blockade of sodium channels within the CNS to the actions of BIIB074. Nonetheless, our 
observations demonstrate a direct inhibitory action of BIIB074 on trigeminal ganglion 
neurons. Together with earlier work demonstrating the presence of Nav1.7 in trigeminal 
ganglion neurons,10, 11 selectivity of BIIB074 for Nav1.7, and a frequency-dependent effect,15-
17 these data further suggest the potential for BIIB074 in trigeminal neuralgia and suggest a 
probable mechanism of action at the site of ectopic impulse activity in trigeminal neuralgia. 
Importantly, a selective Nav1.7 inhibitor also has potential from a mechanistic perspective to 
be effective in other forms of neuropathic pain, such as erythromelalgia, which has been 
shown to be reduced by pharmacological inhibition of Nav1.7.29 BIIB074 is currently being 
investigated in patients with erythromelalgia and has also previously shown a statistically 
significant reduction in pain relative to placebo in a Phase 2 trial in patients with painful 
lumbosacral radiculopathy (data on file). 
This study utilised a randomised withdrawal design. The critical aspect of this design 
in relation to trigeminal neuralgia is that it exposes patients with severe pain to placebo for 
the minimum possible time.20, 30 This also avoids problems with the alternative of using an 
active control such as carbamazepine (e.g. potential for drug-drug interactions, requirement 
for long washout period). While the randomised withdrawal design has been employed 
previously in pain studies,25 to our knowledge this is the first time that it has been used in a 
trigeminal neuralgia population. In a recent systematic review of randomised withdrawal 
trials, Moore et al25 suggested that this methodology is acceptable for trials to address 
efficacy of drugs in chronic non-cancer pain. In our judgement, this trial further supports the 
feasibility of the randomised withdrawal design to evaluate a novel drug in trigeminal 
neuralgia.  
Other key considerations in the design of this study included ensuring diagnostic 
accuracy and homogeneity of the study population. In this regard, we included a diagnostic 
sub-committee of the DMC to ensure that ICHD criteria for classical trigeminal neuralgia 
were met by all patients entering the study. Patients with pain attributable to other disorders 
19 
 
 
 TN Phase 2 
 
 
were excluded. Patients were also required to experience at least three paroxysms of pain 
per day, pain intensity ≥4 (PI-NRS) on at least 4 days during run-in, in order to be eligible for 
inclusion. Further care was taken to select the most appropriate outcome measures for this 
population, with the inclusion of both pain measures and assessments of overall function 
and quality of life (PGIC, CGIC), which can be severely impacted in trigeminal neuralgia.  
Of course, while carefully designed, this trial remains a small phase 2 study and as 
such firm conclusions on efficacy and safety cannot be drawn. The randomised withdrawal 
design has several inherent limitations. For example, there is a risk of bias on transition from 
the open-label to double-blind phase because patients have prior experience of active 
treatment, and those switching to placebo may be aware of the change due to loss of effects 
of the drug on pain or side effects. Indeed, 67-73% of patients and clinicians in both 
treatment groups guessed their treatment assignment correctly. There is also the possibility 
of carry-over effects from active treatment in patients switched to placebo, which may make 
it more difficult to achieve separation between groups in the double-blind phase. The 
enrichment of the study population through the selection of responders in the open-label 
phase also inherently reduces generalizability of the data. A further limitation from a 
functional perspective was that per investigator report patients found it difficult to record in 
the paper diary the number of paroxysms per day (particularly if these were very frequent); 
an electronic diary would be more reliable and may be considered for future studies. 
An additional point of note was the substantial drop in patient numbers from 
screening to the end of the open-label phase of this study. Reasons for this probably 
included regulatory requirements for ECG parameters (exclusion of patients with prolonged 
QT interval), leading to exclusions given the older age of the population (up to 80 years). 
Some patients with severe pain may also have elected to undergo surgery in place of 
entering the trial or have been reluctant to stop their current anticonvulsants for fear of pain 
increase and the need to return to their old medications after completion of the trial. A 
separate paper is in preparation discussing the challenges in recruitment in this study and 
trigeminal neuralgia trials more broadly. Further, a relatively high proportion of patients who 
20 
 
 
 TN Phase 2 
 
 
were enrolled did not complete the open-label phase (23 overall, 18 withdrawing due to ‘lack 
of efficacy’. Many of these patients withdrew in the first few days, and while precise reasons 
were not documented, it is possible that their reluctance to proceed was related to anxiety 
following discontinuation of their prior medications. This will be partially addressed in a 
planned Phase 3 trial by allowing concomitant use of ongoing medications alongside 
BIIB074 for the first 2 weeks. 
Most drugs currently in use to treat this disorder were originally trialled as 
anticonvulsant therapy; to our knowledge BIIB074 is unique in being developed for trigeminal 
neuralgia as the primary indication. Despite the limitations of our study, we believe that the 
results provide a basis for the continued investigation of BIIB074 in trigeminal neuralgia. The 
results from this Phase 2a study have been used to develop and refine the design for a 
forthcoming Phase 3 trial to assess BIIB074 in trigeminal neuralgia, utilizing the randomized 
withdrawal design, and with an increased sample size and longer duration of dosing.

Figure 1. Trial profile. *One of 13 was recorded as a protocol deviation as double-blind 
medication was dispensed without the patient being randomised. †Two completers in the 
placebo group met the criteria for treatment failure but were not withdrawn from the 
study in error. DMC=data monitoring committee; tid=3 times daily. 
 
Figure 2. Kaplan-Meier graph of time to treatment failure during double-blind phase 
(mITT population, N=29). Log-rank test; one-sided p=0.0306. mITT=modified intent-to-
treat.   
 
Figure 3. Mean (SE) percentage change from run-in in (A) number of paroxysms, (B) 
severity of paroxysms, and (C) average daily pain score during open-label and double-
blind treatment (BOCF; mITT population, N=29; post-hoc analysis). Although all patients 
received BIIB074 during the open-label period, data are reported separately for patients 
entering the BIIB074 and placebo groups during double blind treatment (mITT 
population) in order to follow treatment response for these patients over the full study 
period. BOCF=baseline observation carried forward; mITT=modified intent-to-treat; 
SE=standard error.
