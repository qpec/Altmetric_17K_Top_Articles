Essentials
• The association of lung function with venous throm-
boembolism (VTE) is unclear.
• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pat-
terns were associated with a higher risk of VTE.
• Symptoms were also associated with a higher risk of
VTE, but a restrictive pattern was not.
• COPD may increase the risk of VTE and respiratory
symptoms may be a novel risk marker for VTE.
Summary. Background: The evidence for the association
between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and
venous thromboembolism (VTE) is limited. There is no study
investigating the association between restrictive lung disease
(RLD) and respiratory symptoms with VTE. Objectives: To
investigate prospectively the association of lung function
and respiratory symptoms with VTE. Patients/Methods:
In 1987–1989, we assessed lung function by using spirome-
try, and obtained information on respiratory symptoms
(cough, phlegm, and dyspnea) in 14 654 participants aged
45–64 years, without a history of VTE or anticoagulant
use, and followed them through 2011. Participants were
classified into four mutually exclusive groups: ‘COPD’
(forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1]/forced vital capac-
ity [FVC] below the lower limit of normal [LLN]), ‘RLD’
(FEV1/FVC ≥ LLN and FVC < LLN), ‘respiratory symp-
toms with normal spirometic results’ (without RLD or
COPD), and ‘normal’ (without respiratory symptoms,
RLD, or COPD). Results: We documented 639 VTEs (238
unprovoked and 401 provoked VTEs). After adjustment
for VTE risk factors, VTE risk was increased for individu-
als with either respiratory symptoms with normal spiromet-
ric results (hazard ratio [HR] 1.40, 95% confidence interval
[CI] 1.12–1.73) or COPD (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.07–1.67)
but not for those with RLD (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.82–1.60).
These elevated risks of VTE were derived from both unpro-
voked and provoked VTE. Moreover, FEV1 and FEV1/
FVC
showed
dose–response
relationships
with
VTE.
COPD was more strongly associated with pulmonary
embolism than with deep vein thrombosis. Conclusions:
Obstructive spirometric patterns were associated with an
increased risk of VTE, suggesting that COPD may increase
the risk of VTE. Respiratory symptoms may represent a
novel risk marker for VTE.

Introduction
Several studies have reported that chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (COPD), especially an acute exacerbation
of COPD, is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism

 (VTE) [1–4]. However, most information on the associa-
tion of COPD with VTE risk in the general population
relies on results from registry-based studies, with no vali-
dation of VTE diagnoses [5]. A recent prospective popula-
tion-based
cohort
study
investigated
the
association
between COPD and validated VTE risk [5]. The results
suggested that patients with severe COPD may have an
increased risk of ‘provoked’ VTE, but the association was
not statistically significant [5]. In addition, this popula-
tion-based study used the fixed 0.70 cut-off of forced
expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity
(FVC) [5]. The use of a fixed cut-off leads to underdiag-
nosis
in
young
adults
and
overdiagnosis
of
airway
obstruction in adults aged > 40 years, and, as a result,
use of the 5th percentile of distribution as the lower limit
of normal (LLN) is recommended [6,7]. Thus, the evi-
dence for a relationship between COPD and VTE remains
limited.
Although potential mechanisms by which COPD might
cause VTE remain unclear, hypercoagulability, inflamma-
tion, immobilization and pulmonary hypertension with
venous stasis resulting from impaired lung function and
hypoxia are candidate risk mediators [1]. Other respiratory
impairments, such as restrictive lung diseases (RLDs), may
also increase the risk of VTE via similar mechanisms, but,
to the best of our knowledge, no epidemiologic study has
reported the prospective association between VTE and res-
piratory impairments other than COPD.
Here, by using two important markers for respiratory
impairment, i.e. lung function measured by spirometry and
respiratory
symptoms,
we
prospectively
investigated
whether respiratory impairments (lung restriction, airway
obstruction, and others) defined by the LLN are related to
the risk of VTE in a population-based study in the USA.
Methods
Study population
The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study
is an ongoing population-based prospective study of car-
diovascular diseases [8]. The ARIC Study recruited and
examined 15 792, mostly Caucasian or African American,
men and women aged 45–64 years from four US commu-
nities (Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County,
North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi [African Americans
only]; and suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota) in 1987–
1989 (visit 1). The institutional review boards of the col-
laborating institutions approved the study protocol, and
each participant provided written informed consent.
For the present analyses, we excluded participants who
reported a history of VTE or were taking anticoagulants
at baseline survey (n = 349), and participants whose data
on main exposure (n = 188) or any covariates (n = 837)
were missing. We further excluded non-white participants
in Washington County or Minneapolis or non-white/
black participants in Forsyth County (n = 54), in order to
allow multivariable adjustment for race and study site [9].
After exclusions, 14 364 participants were included in the
present analyses.
Main exposure: lung function and respiratory symptoms
Spirometry was conducted at baseline with a water-sealed
Collins Survey II volume displacement spirometer (Col-
lins Medical, Braintree, MA, USA) and PULMO-SCREEN II
software
(PDS
Healthcare
Products,
Louisville,
CO,
USA). At least three acceptable spirograms were sought
from a minimum of five forced expirations. The best sin-
gle spirogram was identified by use of a computer, and
confirmed by a technician according to American Tho-
racic Society guidelines, with a standardized protocol [10].
Quality control was conducted carefully throughout the
study [10]. FEV1 as a percentage of predicted value
(FEV1% predicted), FVC as a percentage of predicted
value (FVC% predicted) and the LLN were calculated by
use of the Hankinson 1999 equations [11]. Bronchodilator
(b-agonist) response was not evaluated at visit 1.
Assessment of respiratory symptoms was based on
responses to a standardized self-administered question-
naire adopted from the Epidemiology Standardization
Project [12]. We chose three representative respiratory
symptoms (cough, phlegm, and dyspnea) on the basis of
the GOLD report [13] and the COPD Foundation Guide
[14]. Participants were considered to have respiratory
symptoms if they responded positively to any of the fol-
lowing questions: ‘Do you usually have a cough?’ (defined
here as ‘cough’); ‘Do you usually bring up phlegm from
your chest?’ (defined here as ‘phlegm’); and ‘Do you have
to walk slower than people of your age on the level
because of breathlessness?’ or ‘Are you too breathless to
leave the house or breathless on dressing or undressing?’
(yes to either, defined here as ‘dyspnea’).
We classified participants into four categories: ‘normal’
was defined as FEV1/FVC ≥ LLN, FVC ≥ LLN, and no
respiratory symptoms; ‘respiratory symptoms with normal
spirometric results’ was defined as respiratory symptoms
but FEV1/FVC ≥ LLN and FVC ≥ LLN; ‘restrictive lung
disease pattern’ was defined as FEV1/FVC ≥ LLN and
FVC < LLN; and ‘COPD pattern’ was defined as FEV1/
FVC < LLN [7]. We included ‘respiratory symptoms with
normal spriometry’ in the present analysis because others
have documented adverse health outcomes among people
in this category [15], and this category may reflect lung
diseases with preserved lung function or borderline RLD
or COPD.
Potential confounding factors
We evaluated a number of potential confounding factors,
assessed at baseline, for the association of respiratory
impairments with VTE. They included age (continuous),

field
center
(whites
in
Washington
County, Forsyth County, or Minneapolis, or African
Americans in Jackson or Forsyth County), body mass
index (BMI) calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2 (contin-
uous), prevalent diabetes, smoking status (current, for-
mer,
or
never),
pack-years
of
cigarettes
smoked
(continuous), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
(continuous), sport index (continuous), and steroid inha-
ler use. We included steroid inhaler use as a potential
confounding factor because some patients with lung dis-
eases receive steroid inhaler treatments, and several previ-
ous reports have suggested a positive association between
steroid use and VTE risk [16,17]. Prevalent diabetes was
defined as a fasting blood glucose level of ≥ 126 mg dL�1,
a non-fasting blood glucose level of ≥ 200 mg dL�1, a
self-reported physician diagnosis of diabetes, or the use of
antidiabetic medication in the past 2 weeks. Pack-years of
cigarettes smoked was calculated as the average number
of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by the number of
years of smoking divided by 20 (the number of cigarettes
in a pack). eGFR was calculated by use of the Chronic
Kidney
Disease
Epidemiology
Collaboration
equa-
tion [18,19]. Sport index was assessed by use of the
Baecke sports questionnaire, with scores ranging from 1
(low) to 5 (high) [20].
Confirmation of VTE
The ARIC investigators contacted participants annually
or semi-annually by telephone to ask about all hospital-
izations in the previous year. Using standard criteria, two
physicians validated possible VTEs by using hospital
records of possible VTE cases reported through 2011 [21].
Secondary VTEs associated with cancer, major trauma,
surgery or marked immobility were classified as ‘pro-
voked VTE’, and all others were classified as ‘unprovoked
VTE’. Pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis
(DVT) were diagnosed by the use of imaging tests.
Statistical analysis
The person-years of follow-up for each participant were
calculated from the baseline (1987–1989) to the first end-
point: VTE, death, loss to follow-up, or the end of fol-
low-up (2011). Hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) of VTE occurrence were calcu-
lated after adjustment for potential confounding factors
by the use of Cox proportional hazard models: Model 1,
adjusted for age, sex, and race/ARIC field center; and
Model 2, additionally adjusted for BMI, prevalent dia-
betes, smoking status, pack-years of cigarettes smoked,
eGFR, sport index, and steroid inhaler use. We con-
structed cubic spline graphs with three knots at the 25th,
50th and 75th percentiles in order to examine dose–re-
sponse relationships between FEV1% predicted, FVC%
predicted or FEV1/FVC and VTE risk.
For sensitivity analyses, we further adjusted Model 2
for: self-reported diagnosis of bronchitis, emphysema, and
asthma, prevalent heart failure, and coronary heart dis-
ease; or competing risks of death from underlying causes
other than VTE; or competing risks of arterial vascular
diseases (coronary heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibril-
lation, and stroke) which may require antithrombotic
treatments [22]. We also used models with a shorter-fol-
low-up time for VTE (5 years from baseline).
The proportional hazards assumption in Cox regression
was tested by the use of risk factor-by-time interactions,
and was not violated. As we found no statistical interactions
between sex or race and main exposures in relation to VTE
risk, an analysis pooled across sex and race was conducted.
SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used
for statistical analyses. All statistical tests were two-tailed,
and P-values of < 0.05 were regarded as significant.
Results
Baseline characteristics according to lung function categories
Among the 14 364 ARIC participants included in the
analysis,
the mean age was 54.1 years, 54.9% were
female, and 25.7% were African Americans. The preva-
lence rates of normal, respiratory symptoms with normal
spirometric results, RLD pattern and COPD pattern were
63.8%, 13.2%, 5.9%, and 17.4%, respectively. As shown
in Table 1, participants with respiratory symptoms or any
of the abnormal spirometric patterns were more likely to
be older, current smokers, have more pack-years and
lower sports indices, and have a reported diagnosis of
bronchitis, emphysema, or asthma, and a history of coro-
nary heart disease and heart failure, than those with nor-
mal spirometric results and no respiratory symptoms.
Those with the RLD pattern were more likely to be obese
and diabetic than those in the other categories.
Associations of respiratory categories with VTE
During 284 969 person-years of follow-up, over a median
of 22.5 years, we documented 639 incident cases of VTE
(238 unprovoked and 401 provoked) (Table 2). In the
age-adjusted,
sex-adjusted
and
race-adjusted
model
(Model 1), participants with respiratory symptoms and
normal spirometric results, with the RLD pattern or with
the COPD pattern had a higher risk of VTE than those
with normal spirometric results and no respiratory symp-
toms. After adjustment for the other risk factors (Model
2), participants with respiratory symptoms and normal
spirometric results had significantly increased risks of
total VTE (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.12–1.73), deriving from
both unprovoked VTE (HR 1.33, 95% CI 0.93–1.91) and
provoked VTE (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.10–1.89), and both
PE (HR 1.33, 95% CI 0.97–1.83) and DVT [HR 1.47,
95% CI 1.09–1.97). Those with the RLD pattern had an

 elevated
risk
of
unprovoked
VTE
(HR 1.52,
95% CI 0.93–2.49) that was not statistically significant.
Those with the COPD pattern had increased risks of total
VTE (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08–1.68) – both unprovoked
(HR 1.50,
95% CI 1.05–2.14)
and
provoked
VTE
(HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.94–1.67) – and were more likely to
have an increased risk of PE (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.09–
2.05)
than
an
increased
risk
of
DVT
(HR 1.20,
95% CI 0.87–1.65). No significantly increased risk of can-
cer-related VTE was observed among those with respira-
tory
symptoms
and
normal
spriometry
(HR 1.28,
95% CI 0.85–1.93), with the RLD pattern (HR 0.67,
95% CI 0.31–1.46), or with the COPD pattern (HR 1.30,
95% CI 0.87–1.96) (not shown in Table 2).
Dose–response relationships between spirometry
measurements and VTE
In order to examine how the degree of lung restriction or
airway obstruction was associated with VTE risk, the
continuous relationships of FEV1% predicted, FVC%
predicted and FEV1/FVC with VTE incidence were plot-
ted by the use of restricted cubic splines (Fig. 1). Dose–
response relationships were generally observed, with lower
levels of FEV1/FVC and FEV1 being significantly associ-
ated with elevated risks of total VTE.
Sensitivity analyses
For sensitivity analyses, we first further adjusted for self-
reported
diagnoses
of
bronchitis,
emphysema,
and
asthma, prevalent heart failure or coronary heart disease
(data not shown), competing risks of death from underly-
ing causes other than VTE (Model 3 in Table 2), or com-
peting risks of arterial vascular diseases (data not shown),
and found almost identical associations between lung
function and VTE risk. Next, we used models with
shorter follow-up intervals (within 5 years from baseline).
Similar trends were observed, although the results of the
analyses were less likely to be statistically significant,
owing to the smaller number of VTE events (49 cases for
5-year follow-up) (Table S1 and Fig. S1).

 Discussion
In this prospective population-based cohort study, partici-
pants with respiratory symptoms but normal spirometric
patterns and obstructive spirometric patterns had an
increased risk of VTE. The previous study reported an
elevated risk of only provoked VTE among those with
obstructive spirometric patterns [5], but, in the present
study, we found they had increased risks of not only pro-
voked but also unprovoked (not secondary) VTE. In
addition, lower FEV1% predicted and FEV1/FVC, which
are indices of airway obstruction, were associated with an
elevated risk of VTE. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first prospective population-based cohort study to
investigate the association of lung function and respira-
tory symptoms with VTE occurrence, and to suggest that
respiratory symptoms may constitute a risk marker for
VTE. Furthermore, we have provided further evidence
that COPD may increase the risk of VTE.
COPD involves pulmonary and systemic inflammation
[23,24]. Inflammation-induced hypercoagulability, hypox-
ia, pulmonary hypertension and venous stasis resulting

COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; FEV1, forced expiratory volume in 1 s; FVC, forced vital capacity; LLN, lower limit of normal.
Spirometry was performed without bronchodilators. Normal was defined as FEV1/FVC ≥ LLN and FVC ≥ LLN, respiratory symptoms with
normal spirometry as respiratory symptoms but FEV1/FVC ≥ LLN and FVC ≥ LLN, a restrictive lung disease pattern as FEV1/FVC ≥ LLN
and FVC < LLN, and a COPD pattern as FEV1/FVC < LLN. Model 1: adjusted for age, sex, and race/ARIC field center. Model 2: adjusted
for Model 1 + body mass index, diabetes mellitus, estimated glomerular filtration rate, pack-years, smoking status, sports index, and steroid
inhaler use. Model 3: adjusted for Model 2 + competing risks of death from underlying causes other than venous thromboembolism.

 from immobility might all increase the risk of VTE [1]. In
the present study, those with the COPD pattern had an
increased
risk
of
unprovoked
VTE,
which
may
be
explained by these mechanisms. As previous registry-
based studies have suggested, our study also showed that
the COPD pattern was associated with PE rather than
DVT [5]. This may be partially because COPD patients
may often have computed tomography scans, and thus be
more likely to be diagnosed with PE (referral bias). In
addition, cubic spline graphs suggested inverse dose–re-
sponse relationships of FEV1% predicted and FEV1/FVC
with VTE. COPD is characterized by reduced FEV1/FVC
[25]. Thus, these results support the hypothesis that
COPD may increase the risk of VTE.
Those with the RLD pattern also had an increased risk
of unprovoked VTE, but the association was not signifi-
cant. Possible reasons for this may be that the number of
participants with the RLD pattern (847 versus 2499 with
the COPD pattern) was insufficient, and that perhaps the
RLD pattern was also closely related to comorbidities,
such as obesity and diabetes [26,27]. Thus, a further study
will be needed on the association between RLD and VTE
risk.
Participants with respiratory symptoms and a normal
spirometric pattern also had an increased risk of VTE,
particularly provoked VTE (Model 3 in Table 2). We
speculate that their increased risk of VTE may be mainly
attributable to immobility, cancer, heart failure, border-
line COPD, or other comorbidities. Of course, respiratory
symptoms would not constitute a causal risk factor for
VTE, but a marker for such comorbidities. Although our
further adjustment for prevalent heart failure did not
change the result, we cannot rule out the possibility of
bias from undiagnosed heart failure (residual confound-
ing), as heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction is
hard to diagnose [28]. In addition, those with respiratory
symptoms and a normal spirometric pattern had an
increased risk of cancer-related VTE (HR 1.28), although
the association was not significant. In any case, respira-
tory symptoms may constitute a noteworthy marker of
increased risk of VTE.
Although several previous studies have demonstrated
associations of reduced spirometry measurements with
increased risks of cardiovascular diseases, such as coro-
nary heart disease [29], heart failure [30], stroke [31], and
atrial fibrillation [32], no study has shown a relationship
of lung function with VTE risk. These previous studies
reported that FEV1 was associated with increased risks of
cardiovascular diseases, but that FEV1/FVC was not.
Thus, VTE might be more strongly associated with air-
way obstruction than are other cardiovascular diseases.
The strengths of our study include its prospective
design, a long follow-up, and validated VTE events. In
addition, we used the LLN spirometry measurements, not

 fixed cut-offs, to define RLD and COPD, which theoreti-
cally reduced the misclassification of exposures.
Nonetheless, some limitations need to be addressed.
First, although we assumed that the obstructive spiromet-
ric pattern was mainly COPD, as in other epidemiologic
studies
[5,15,33,34],
only
pre-bronchodilator
measure-
ments were available. Thus, some participants without
lung disease might have been included in the obstructive
category, but this misclassification would tend to bias the
results towards the null, and do not readily explain the
observed associations. In addition, we did not have data
on total lung capacity, which is needed to meet the strict
definition of RLD [35]. Also, our follow-up was quite
long, and the lung function values and symptoms at base-
line would certainly have changed during follow-up.
Although the results from both long-term and short-term
(5 years) follow-ups showed similar trends, we cannot
rule out the possibility of exposure misclassification, espe-
cially among participants with respiratory symptoms and
normal spirometric results, because respiratory symptoms
are subjective, unlike spirometric results. Some of the par-
ticipants’ symptoms might have stopped over time, where
other participants might have developed COPD. The for-
mer could have led to an overestimation of the risk of
VTE and the latter to an underestimation. Those with a
COPD or an RLD pattern might have returned to normal
lung function over time, because of, for example, treat-
ment, and this would have led to an underestimation of
the risk of VTE. Finally, the possibility of residual con-
founding of the observed associations cannot be ruled
out, although the extent of potential bias is probably
small, given our detailed adjustment for many known
confounders.
In
conclusion,
in
the
prospective
population-based
ARIC cohort, obstructive spirometric patterns (COPD
pattern, low FEV1, and low FEV1/FVC) were associated
with an elevated risk of VTE, suggesting that COPD may
increase the risk of VTE. Furthermore, the presence of
respiratory symptoms might be a novel risk marker for
VTE. Those with the RLD pattern also had an increased
risk of VTE, but the association was not significant, per-
haps because it is closely related to comorbidities.
