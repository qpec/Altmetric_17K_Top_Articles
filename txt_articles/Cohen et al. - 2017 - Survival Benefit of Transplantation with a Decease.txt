Abstract
Background and objectives Use of diabetic donor kidneys has been a necessary response to the donor organ
shortage. Recipients of diabetic donor kidneys have higher mortality risk compared with recipients of nondiabetic
donor kidneys. However, the survival benefit of transplantation with diabetic donor kidneys over remaining on
the waitlist has not been previously evaluated.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements We performed an observational cohort study of 437,619 kidney
transplant candidates from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database, including 8101
recipients of diabetic donor kidneys and 126,560 recipients of nondiabetic donor kidneys. We used time-varying
Cox proportional hazards modeling to assess the mortality risk of accepting a diabetic donor kidney compared
with remaining on the waitlist or receiving a nondiabetic donor kidney.
Results Among transplant recipients, median follow-up was 8.9 years and mortality rate was 35 deaths per 1000
person-years. Recipients of diabetic donor kidneys had 9% lower mortality compared with remaining on the
waitlist or transplantation with a nondiabetic donor kidney (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval,
0.84 to 0.98).Although recipientsofnondiabetic donorkidneyswithaKidneyDonorProfileIndexscore .85%had
lower mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.81 to 0.91), recipients of diabetic donor
kidneys with an index score .85% did not show any difference (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence
interval, 0.97 to 1.22). Patients aged ,40 years attained no survival benefit from transplantation with diabetic
donor kidneys; diabetic patients at centers with long waitlist times attained the greatest survival benefit.
Conclusions Diabetic donor kidneys appear associated with higher mortality risk compared with nondiabetic
donor kidneys, but offer greater survival benefit compared with remaining on the waitlist for many candidates.
Patients with high risk of mortality on the waitlist at centers with long wait times appear to benefit most from
transplantation with diabetic donor kidneys.

Introduction
In response to the growing demand for kidney trans-
plantation, utilization of high risk or marginal donor
kidneys is expanding in the United States (1). In
particular, utilization of diabetic donor kidneys has
more than doubled over the past decade (2). However,
diabetic donor kidneys are associated with an in-
creased risk of allograft failure and all-cause mortality
compared with deceased nondiabetic donor kidneys.
The risk associated with diabetic donor kidneys is
particularly elevated for diabetic recipients (2).
In December of 2014, the new kidney allocation
system was implemented using the Kidney Donor
Profile Index (KDPI) and Estimated Post Transplant
Survival (EPTS) score. KDPI assigns a weighted graft
failure risk score to deceased donor kidneys on the
basis of a broad range of donor characteristics (3,4).
The EPTS score determines recipient mortality risk,
taking into account recipient characteristics (3). Donor
and recipient diabetes statuses are heavily weighted in
the KDPI and EPTS scoring, respectively (5–7). With
the new allocation process, diabetic recipients have
limited access to low risk kidneys, increasing the
likelihood that lower quality kidneys, including di-
abetic donor kidneys, will be transplanted into di-
abetic recipients.
The elevated risk associated with accepting mar-
ginal donor kidneys needs to be balanced with the
risks of remaining on the waitlist. Previous studies
demonstrated a survival benefit from transplantation
with expanded criteria donor (ECD) kidneys [defined
as kidneys from donors aged $60 years, or 50–59
years with at least two risk factors, including (1)
cerebrovascular cause of death, (2) hypertension, or
(3) creatinine.1.5 mg/dl] compared with remaining
on the waitlist, particularly among diabetic recipients
and in regions with longer waitlist times (8,9). Sim-
ilarly, previous data demonstrated a survival benefit

 from transplantation with high-KDPI kidneys, particularly
among patients at centers with longer median waitlist
times (10). Nonetheless, no previous studies have evalu-
ated the survival benefit of accepting a diabetic donor
kidney specifically compared with remaining on the
waitlist.
Accordingly, this study investigates the effect of donor
and recipient diabetes status on mortality risk in eligible
potential recipients on the transplant waiting list. Our goal
was to identify which patients may benefit most from
transplantation with diabetic donor kidneys as waiting
times lengthen and demand for marginal donor kidneys
increases, despite the previously demonstrated hazards
associated with this type of organ offer.
Materials and Methods
Data Source
We used national registry data collected by the Organ
Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN). The
OPTN data system includes data on all donor, waitlisted
candidates, and transplant recipients in the United States,
submitted by the members of the OPTN. The Health
Resources and Services Administration, US Department
of Health and Human Services provides oversight to the
activities of the OPTN contractor. The study was deter-
mined to meet institutional review board exemption
authorized by Code of Federal Regulations §46.101, cate-
gory 4 by the Institutional Review Board at the University
of Pennsylvania (protocol no. 821021).
Cohort
The cohort included patients on the waitlist or who
received a deceased donor kidney between January 1, 1994
(the year of the first diabetic donor kidney transplant) and
March 31, 2015. Patient follow-up was through June 5,
2015, date of death, or date of deactivation from the
waitlist, whichever was first. The study was restricted to
incident waitlist candidates who were $18 years of age at
the time of waitlisting, and to patients listed for their first
kidney transplant (10). Patients who were never active on
the waitlist during the study period and patients listed for
multiorgan transplant were excluded (11).
Variables and Covariates
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Mortality
data were provided as part of the OPTN dataset. All
covariates for waitlisted patients (candidates) were ascer-
tained from the forms submitted to the OPTN at the time of
waitlisting. Candidate diabetes status was reported in the
database as “DIAB.” The “DGN-TCR” variable in the
database, which defines the diagnostic etiology of CKD,
provided additional information regarding diabetes status
in some candidates. Candidate sensitization was desig-
nated as panel reactive antibody .30%, on the basis of
previous studies in this area (2,12). Dialysis vintage time
was defined as duration of dialysis before waitlisting.
Additional candidate-associated covariates used in the
multivariable analyses included age, sex, race, year of
waitlisting (in order to take into account era-effect), and
ABO blood type (2,13–15). For categorical analyses of
candidate age, locally weighted scatterplot smoothing
demonstrated a cut-point for increased mortality at 40
years of age (16), which has also been utilized in existing
literature (2,9). Donor diabetes status was reported as
“DIABETES_DON.” Center median waitlist time tertiles
were calculated by using the median waitlist times for all
patients in the OPTN dataset at each transplant center
(9,10).
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive Statistics. Statistical analyses were per-
formed using STATA version 13.0 (StataCorp., College
Station, TX) with two-sided hypothesis testing and P,0.05
as the criteria for statistical significance. Descriptive sta-
tistics (mean, median, and proportion) were used to de-
scribe baseline clinical and demographic characteristics
comparing recipients of diabetic donors, recipients of
nondiabetic donors, and patients who were only ever on
the waitlist. Continuous variables were compared using t
test or rank-sum test for non-normally distributed vari-
ables. Categorical and binary variables were compared
using chi-squared test.
Time-Varying Cox Models: Cumulative Mortality. For
the overall analysis, we compared the hazard of all-cause
mortality of transplantation with a diabetic donor kidney
compared with a composite reference group of transplan-
tation with a nondiabetic donor kidney or remaining on the
waitlist. Patients entered into the study at the time of
waitlisting. Cox proportional hazards regression was used
to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (95% CIs). Time-varying exposure was incorpo-
rated at the time of transplant with either a diabetic or
nondiabetic donor kidney (10,17,18).
Time-Varying Cox Models: Mortality Intervals Post-
Transplant. Multiple previous studies have demonstrated
that transplantation with a deceased donor kidney is
initially associated with an increased mortality hazard
compared with remaining on the waitlist that declines over
time (9,10,18). In order to address this, we performed
analyses dividing the hazard of mortality into time inter-
vals at 30 days post-transplant, 90 days post-transplant, 183
days (i.e., 6 months) post-transplant, 365 days (i.e., 1 year)
post-transplant, 730 days (i.e., 2 years) post-transplant, and
1095 days (i.e., 3 years) post-transplant (10).
Model Parameters and Censoring. Patients were cen-
sored at the time of removal from the waitlist or at the end
of the follow-up period (June 5, 2015). For the multivari-
able regression, we selected recipient factors a priori that
were known to be risk factors for mortality (2,13–15). On
the basis of evidence from previous studies (2,9,10), we
assessed for effect modification between donor and re-
cipient diabetes status, donor diabetes status and median
center waitlist time tertile, and recipient diabetes status
and median center waitlist time tertile. The proportional
hazards assumption was assessed via weighted versions of
Kaplan–Meier curves using log-log plots as well as
graphical displays on the basis of Schoenfeld and scaled
Schoenfeld residuals (19).
Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analyses were performed in which the donor
kidney exposure groups were further divided into KDPI

975
 categories, using a KDPI cut-point of #85% versus .85% to
distinguish the degree of quality of the diabetic donor
kidneys (5). Sensitivity analyses were also performed
limiting the cohort to patients who indicated that they
were willing to accept an ECD donor kidney. Willingness
to accept an ECD donor kidney was used as a surrogate
marker for willingness to accept a high risk donor kidney,
such as a diabetic donor kidney. The purpose of this
sensitivity analysis was to exclude patients who would not
have been offered a diabetic donor kidney. Additional
sensitivity analyses were performed in which the cohort
was limited to patients who were always active on the
waitlist (11), limited to patients who were waitlisted on or
after 2004 to assess for era effect (2), and stratified by
candidate age ,40 or $40 years.
Handling of Covariate Missingness
Waitlist candidates were excluded from the study if
candidate or donor diabetes status was missing (n=30,596;
4.2% of patients assessed for eligibility in the study), as
these were the primary exposure variables being evaluated
in the cohort (2). Covariates included in the multivariate
models were ,5% incomplete. Given the large size of the
cohort, missing data were addressed with a complete case
analysis (20).
Results
Patient and Donor Characteristics
There were 437,619 patients eligible for inclusion in the
study (see Figure 1). Among these patients, there were 8101
recipients of diabetic donor kidneys, 126,560 recipients of
nondiabetic donor kidneys, and 302,958 waitlisted patients
who never achieved transplantation. There was a signifi-
cant difference between recipients of diabetic donor kid-
neys, recipients of nondiabetic donor kidneys, and patients
who remained on the waitlist in all clinical and demo-
graphic characteristics evaluated (Table 1). Recipients of
diabetic donor kidneys were older at the time of waitlist-
ing (median age, 55 versus 51 years), had longer waitlist
times (median, 675 versus 600 days), and were more
likely to have delayed graft function (30% versus 24%)
than recipients of nondiabetic donor kidneys. Diabetic
donor kidneys had a higher KDPI (taking into account
inclusion of diabetes in the calculation; median KDPI,
81% versus 44%) and came from donors with a higher
body mass index (30 versus 25 kg/m2) compared with
nondiabetic donor kidneys. Patients who remained on the
waitlist were more likely to be at centers in the longest
tertile of median center waitlist time (43% were at centers
in the longest tertile compared with 29% of recipients of
diabetic donor kidneys and 27% of recipients of non-
diabetic donor kidneys), and had a higher rate of
candidate diabetes (50% compared with 39% of recipients
of diabetic donor kidneys and 34% of recipients of
nondiabetic donor kidneys). During the follow-up pe-
riod, 79% of transplant centers performed at least one
transplant in which a candidate received a diabetic donor
kidney.
Multivariable Regression Analyses for All-Cause Mortality
Median follow-up of transplant recipients in the primary
analysis was 8.9 years. Compared with patients who either
remained on the waitlist or received a nondiabetic donor
kidney, patients who received a diabetic donor kidney
had a significantly decreased cumulative hazard of

see Supplemental Material, Supplemental Table 1). When
taking into account KDPI compared with remaining on the
waitlist or transplantation with a nondiabetic low-KDPI
(KDPI#85%) kidney, recipients of diabetic low-KDPI
kidneys (Table 2; HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.85) and
nondiabetic high-KDPI kidneys (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81 to
0.91) had a significantly lower hazard of mortality. How-
ever, recipients of diabetic high-KDPI kidneys had no
reduction in mortality (Table 2; HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.97 to
1.22; see Supplemental Table 2). These findings persisted
after restricting the cohort to patients willing to accept an
ECD kidney, always active on the waitlist, waitlisted on or
after 2004, and age 40 years or older at the time of waitlisting.
Candidates aged ,40 years at the time of waitlisting had
no significant reduction in mortality from accepting a diabetic
donor kidney, regardless of KDPI, nor from accepting a high-
KDPI nondiabetic donor kidney.

Multivariable Regression Analyses for All-Cause Mortality:
Post-Transplant Time-Point Analyses
Compared with either remaining on the waitlist or
receiving a nondiabetic donor kidney, diabetic recipients
in the shortest waitlist tertile had a significantly higher
mortality risk until 6 months post-transplant; all other
recipients only had a significantly higher mortality risk
until 30 days post-transplant (Figure 3, Supplemental
Figure 2). Diabetic recipients of diabetic donor kidneys
in the longest waitlist tertile had significantly lower all-
cause mortality within 6 months post-transplant compared
with either remaining on the waitlist or receiving a non-
diabetic donor kidney, in contrast to a minimum of 1 year
in all other exposure strata.
Discussion
Our study demonstrates a considerable survival benefit
among patients who were transplanted with a diabetic
donor kidney compared with patients who remained on
the waitlist. Diabetic recipients at centers with the longest
waitlist times achieve the earliest benefit from transplan-
tation with diabetic donor kidneys compared with either
remaining on the waitlist or receiving a nondiabetic donor
kidney. Recipients of low-KDPI (KDPI#85%) diabetic
donor kidneys and high-KDPI (KDPI.85%) nondiabetic
donor kidneys have lower mortality compared with remain-
ing on the waitlist or transplantation with a low-KDPI
nondiabetic donor kidney; however, recipients transplanted
with a high-KDPI diabetic donor kidney have no reduction in
mortality. Additionally, candidates aged ,40 years at the
time of waitlisting have no survival benefit from trans-
plantation with a diabetic donor kidney, regardless of KDPI.
This is the first study to evaluate the risk of trans-
plantation with a diabetic donor kidney in contrast to the
risk of dying on the waitlist. Our previous work
demonstrated a modest but significantly increased hazard
of mortality and graft failure among recipients of diabetic
donor kidneys compared with recipients of nondiabetic
donor kidneys (2). However, the results of this study
demonstrate a markedly greater survival benefit in pa-
tients who are transplanted with a diabetic donor kidney
compared with remaining on the waitlist, particularly

 among patients at centers with the longest waitlist times.
This study also demonstrates that high-KDPI diabetic
donor kidneys contribute greater mortality risk compared
with high-KDPI nondiabetic donor kidneys. Taken to-
gether, these data enhance the risk information provided
by the KDPI calculation and can help to optimize physi-
cian and patient decision-making regarding organ offer
acceptance.
These results compliment previous studies evaluating
the risk of transplantation with deceased donor kidneys,
and particularly marginal donor kidneys, compared with
remaining on the waitlist (8,9,18). In a 2001 OPTN registry
study, Ojo et al. (8) demonstrated that transplantation
with a marginal donor kidney increased patients’ life
expectancy by up to 10 years compared with patients
who remained on the waitlist, depending on recipient risk
factors. Using Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients
data in 2005, Merion et al. (9) demonstrated that longer
organ procurement organization waitlist tertile was asso-
ciated with significantly greater reduction in relative risk
for mortality from transplantation with an ECD kidney
compared with remaining on the waitlist (except in patients
aged ,40 years, similar to our findings with diabetic
kidneys). In 2014, Massie et al. (10) found that transplan-
tation with a high-KDPI kidney was associated with
increased short-term but decreased long-term mortality
risk compared with remaining on the waitlist or receiving a
low-KDPI kidney; the lowest mortality risk was among
patients at centers with the longest median waitlist times.
Consistent with these previous studies, our analysis dem-
onstrated that transplantation with a diabetic donor kidney
was associated with an initial increase in perioperative
mortality risk, but decrease in long-term mortality risk; the
earliest survival benefit and greatest magnitude of cumu-
lative survival benefit were among diabetic recipients at
centers with the longest waitlist times.
Our study is strengthened by the large sample size,
extensive generalizability, and long duration of follow-up.
Given the comprehensiveness of the OPTN registry data, a
broad range of recipient and donor characteristics were
incorporated into the descriptive and multivariable anal-
yses. Notably, the use of time-varying exposure to trans-
plantation, taking into account donor diabetes status,
permitted direct comparison of transplanted patients to
those remaining on the waitlist, giving appropriate recog-
nition to relative duration of time on the waitlist.
There were also limitations to this study. Although
degree of diabetic injury in the donor kidney likely plays an
important role in decisions about accepting these organs,
OPTN data lack consistent, detailed proteinuria or pro-
curement biopsy data (only 30% of donor kidneys had
biopsies performed at the time of transplant, with no

Figure 3. | Candidates at centers with the longest median waitlist times who received a diabetic donor kidney transplant had the earliest
significantly lower post-transplant hazard of mortality compared with the strategy of remaining on the waitlist or receiving a nondiabetic
donor kidney, particularly among diabetic candidates. The error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.

 consistent reporting of typical findings appreciated in
diabetic nephropathy, such as nodularity). Additionally,
duration of donor diabetes is not reliably recorded. Fur-
thermore, the considerably greater mortality risk among
patients on the waitlist may have been reflective in part of
greater burden of illness among patients who were not
transplanted. To address this potential selection bias, we
restricted the analyses to patients who were waitlisted for
the first time and who were not listed for multiorgan
transplant, in addition to adjusting for important risk
factors for mortality. We also performed sensitivity anal-
yses, restricting the analysis to only include patients who
were always active on the waitlist.
Although diabetic donor kidneys contribute additional
mortality risk compared with nondiabetic deceased donor
kidneys, this study highlights the importance of continu-
ing to use marginal donor kidneys in appropriate circum-
stances (21). Given that a substantial percentage of
transplant centers still do not transplant diabetic donor
kidneys into potential candidates, there evidently con-
tinues to be reticence to use diabetic kidneys, above and
beyond the information provided by KDPI. Patients in
areas with the longest waitlist times and with the highest
risk of dying on the waitlist have the greatest potential
benefit from receipt of diabetic donor kidneys. The in-
creased use of marginal donor kidneys over the past
several decades has been a necessary response to the
increased demand for deceased donor kidneys (22). The
new allocation system has generated heightened atten-
tion to the need to appropriately allocate high risk donor
kidneys and optimize utilization of these organs (23).
When accepted by appropriate candidates, diabetic do-
nor kidneys have the potential to shorten waitlist times,
and ideally reduce the risk of death on the waitlist. Future
studies are needed to continue to improve our under-
standing of the interactions between specific recipient
and donor risk factors, and to help guide decision-
making in the allocation of high risk donor kidneys.
