Association Between Gun Law Reforms and Intentional
Firearm Deaths in Australia, 1979-2013
Simon Chapman, PhD; Philip Alpers; Michael Jones, PhD
IMPORTANCE Rapid-fire weapons are often used by perpetrators in mass shooting incidents. In
1996 Australia introduced major gun law reforms that included a ban on semiautomatic rifles
and pump-action shotguns and rifles and also initiated a program for buyback of firearms.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether enactment of the 1996 gun laws and buyback program were
followed by changes in the incidence of mass firearm homicides and total firearm deaths.
DESIGN Observational study using Australian government statistics on deaths caused by
firearms (1979-2013) and news reports of mass shootings in Australia (1979–May 2016).
Changes in intentional firearm death rates were analyzed with negative binomial regression,
and data on firearm-related mass killings were compared.
EXPOSURES Implementation of major national gun law reforms.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Changes in mass fatal shooting incidents (defined as
�5 victims, not including the perpetrator) and in trends of rates of total firearm deaths,
firearm homicides and suicides, and total homicides and suicides per 100 000 population.
RESULTS From 1979-1996 (before gun law reforms), 13 fatal mass shootings occurred in
Australia, whereas from 1997 through May 2016 (after gun law reforms), no fatal mass
shootings occurred. There was also significant change in the preexisting downward trends for
rates of total firearm deaths prior to vs after gun law reform. From 1979-1996, the mean rate
of total firearm deaths was 3.6 (95% CI, 3.3-3.9) per 100 000 population (average decline of
3% per year; annual trend, 0.970; 95% CI, 0.963-0.976), whereas from 1997-2013 (after gun
law reforms), the mean rate of total firearm deaths was 1.2 (95% CI, 1.0-1.4) per 100 000
population (average decline of 4.9% per year; annual trend, 0.951; 95% CI, 0.940-0.962),
with a ratio of trends in annual death rates of 0.981 (95% CI, 0.968-0.993). There was a
statistically significant acceleration in the preexisting downward trend for firearm suicide
(ratio of trends, 0.981; 95% CI, 0.970-0.993), but this was not statistically significant for
firearm homicide (ratio of trends, 0.975; 95% CI, 0.949-1.001). From 1979-1996, the mean
annual rate of total nonfirearm suicide and homicide deaths was 10.6 (95% CI, 10.0-11.2)
per 100 000 population (average increase of 2.1% per year; annual trend, 1.021; 95% CI,
1.016-1.026), whereas from 1997-2013, the mean annual rate was 11.8 (95% CI, 11.3-12.3)
per 100 000 (average decline of 1.4% per year; annual trend, 0.986; 95% CI, 0.980-0.993),
with a ratio of trends of 0.966 (95% CI, 0.958-0.973). There was no evidence of substitution
of other lethal methods for suicides or homicides.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Following enactment of gun law reforms in Australia in 1996,
there were no mass firearm killings through May 2016. There was a more rapid decline in
firearm deaths between 1997 and 2013 compared with before 1997 but also a decline in total
nonfirearm suicide and homicide deaths of a greater magnitude. Because of this, it is not
possible to determine whether the change in firearm deaths can be attributed to
the gun law reforms.

I
n 1996, Australia’
s state and federal governments intro-
duced sweeping uniform gun laws that were progres-
sively implemented in all 6 states and 2 territories be-
tweenJune1996andAugust1998.Theenactmentoftheselaws
followed a massacre on April 28, 1996, in which a man used 2
semiautomaticriflestokill35peopleandwound19others.The
new gun laws banned rapid-fire long guns (including those al-
ready in private ownership), explicitly to reduce their avail-
ability for mass shootings.1,2
In addition, by January 1, 1997, all 8 governments com-
menced a mandatory buyback at market price of prohibited
firearms. As of August 2001, 659 940 newly prohibited semi-
automatic and pump-action rifles and shotguns had been pur-
chased by the federal government from their civilian owners
at market value, funded by a one-off levy on income tax, and
destroyed.3,4 From October 1, 1997, large criminal penalties,
including imprisonment and heavy fines, applied to posses-
sion of any prohibited weapon.
During a second firearm buyback in 2003, 68 727 hand-
guns were collected and destroyed.5,6 Thousands of gun own-
ersalsovoluntarilysurrenderedadditional,nonprohibitedfire-
arms without compensation, and since 1996 thousands more
privately owned firearms are known to have been surren-
dered, seized, and melted down.7
In 2006 an analysis indicated that no mass shootings had
occurred during the decade after the enactment of the 1996
gun laws and the buyback programs.8 The purpose of the
present study was to update the data and test 2 specific hy-
potheses: (1) whether the rate of decline in firearm-related
deaths accelerated after the introduction of gun control laws
in 1996 and (2) whether there was a step change in which the
mortality rate increased or decreased immediately after the in-
troduction of gun control laws. Total all-cause homicides and
all-method suicides were also examined to assess the possi-
bility that substitution of other lethal methods may have oc-
curred: that is, with reduced access to firearms, whether those
with homicidal or suicidal intent used other methods such as
knives or hanging to commit homicide or suicide.
Methods
Data on intentional (suicide and homicide) deaths caused by
firearms were obtained from the National Injury Surveillance
Unit, sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
mortality data collection 1979-2013, coded by International
ClassificationofDiseases,NinthRevision,andInternationalSta-
tistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems,
Tenth Revision.9 These are the latest available data adjusted
from preliminary numbers following subsequent findings by
a coroner about intent that can occur several years after the
death is first registered. All sudden deaths in which the de-
ceased person had not been under medical care are subject to
mandatory determination of death by state coronial investi-
gations.Thisalwaysoccurswithsuicidesandhomicides.These
data represent a census of all intentional firearm deaths in
Australia for those 35 years, other than shootings by police.
Populationdatarepresentingperson-yearsatriskofdeathwere
obtainedfromtheABSforthesameperiod,andintentionalfire-
arm death rates per 100 000 were calculated.
Changes in these rates for the 18 years up to and includ-
ing the year in which the new firearm laws were announced
(1979-1996) were compared with rates of change for the fol-
lowing 17 years (1997-2013) to examine the hypothesis that the
passage of the new gun laws was associated with an accelera-
tion in the existing decline in rates of firearm homicides, fire-
arm suicides, and total intentional firearm deaths, excluding
police shootings. Fatal “legal intervention” shootings by po-
lice were excluded because these shootings were not the fo-
cus of the gun laws enacted in 1996-1997. For the period after
1996, rates of total all-cause (and nonfirearm) homicides and
suicides were also examined to consider whether perpetra-
tors may have substituted other lethal means if the gun laws
reduced their access to firearms.
Numbers of deaths by category (total and components)
have been viewed as arising from an overdispersed Poisson
process and analyzed using negative binomial regression
with annual Australian person-years at risk, obtained from
the ABS, used as an offset. In practical terms, an offset acts
to convert the number of deaths to a death rate that is com-
parable across time regardless of how many individuals are
at risk of death. Mean death rates averaged over a period are
reported as death rate × 100 000 to yield number of deaths
per 100 000 people.
Given that the rate of firearm deaths had been decreasing
prior to the national reform and harmonization of gun laws, 2
hypotheses were tested:
•A change in annual trend for death rates
•A step change in which there is an abrupt change in mortality
rates immediately after the introduction of gun control laws
Because counts are of deaths, it can be assumed that ob-
servations are independent across years. Three models were
fitted for each type of firearm death.
Model a:
ln(di) = ln(ni) + β00 + β10 yeari + ei, i = 1979, …, 1996
Model b:
ln(di) = ln(ni) + β01 + β11 yeari + ei, i = 1997, …, 2013
Model c:
ln(di) = ln(ni) = β02 + β12 yeari + β22Lawi + β32 yeari × Lawi + ei

where i is 1, 2, …, 35 and Law is 0 if the year is 1996 or earlier
and 1 if the year is 1997 or later.
The variable year indicates calendar year but was coded
as calendar year minus 1996 in model c. This makes 1996 the
year at which the model intercept is estimated. The variable
di indicates the number of deaths by a given cause in year i,
and ni indicates the person-years at risk in year i. The term ei
indicates the residual (error in prediction) in year i.
Models a and b are included for descriptive purposes and
were used to estimate the trend (measured as the average rela-
tivechangeindeathratesperyear)indeathsintheperiodsprior
to (1979-1996) and after (1997-2013) the introduction of new
gun laws, through eβ10 and eβ11, respectively.
Model c was used to estimate both the change in annual
trends in firearm-related deaths associated with the introduc-
tionofrevisedgunlawsthroughtheinteractiontermyear × Law
and the step change in mortality immediately after the intro-
duction of gun control laws through the Law main effect.
The 3 models are related because the model is parameter-
ized, β32 = β11 − β10, and therefore, eβ22 estimates the ratio of
annual trend (denoted as RT in this article) in deaths after in-
troduction to before the introduction of the gun laws. Simi-
larly, β22 represents the change in intercept (level of annual
death rate) around the time of gun control law introduction,
and eβ22 represents the ratio of intercepts (denoted as ratio of
levels [RL] in the article).
All statistics are reported with 95% confidence intervals.
Statistical testing involved calculating 2-tailed P values, and
P < .05 is considered statistically significant. All statistical
analyses were performed using Stata version 14.
Analyses were undertaken separately within firearm-
related and non–firearm-related deaths as well as total deaths
for homicide and suicide to investigate possible substitution
of other lethal means instead of firearms. If substitution
occurred (ie, other lethal means were used to commit homi-
cides or suicides), the expected findings would be an increas-
ing downward trend in firearm deaths after the introduction
of gun control laws but a compensatory lesser downward or
even upward trend in non–firearm-related deaths over the
same period.
Todeterminewhetherthemassgun-relatedhomicidesthat
occurred prior to the introduction of Australia’
s new gun laws
might have distorted the comparison with gun-related homi-
cides after implementation of the gun laws, a sensitivity analy-
sis was conducted in which the number of deaths due to mass
homicide was subtracted from the total firearm gun deaths for
that calendar year. The resulting counts were then analyzed
using the same procedure.
Using several online news media databases (Factiva,
ProQuest, NewsText, and News Store online) as well as web
search engine queries for mass shootings, one author (P.A.)
verified reports of all mass shooting incidents in Australia
(defined here, as in a previous analysis,8 as ≥5 victims killed
by gunshot, not including the perpetrator). These media re-
ports were used to compare the reported numbers of such
shootings that occurred before (1979-1996) and after (1997 and
later) the introduction of the new gun laws. These searches
were most recently repeated on May 10, 2016.
The study activities were reviewed by the research integ-
rity and ethics administration of the University of Sydney
according to the National Statement of Ethical Conduct in
Human Research (2007). As only official, public government,
nationally aggregated data and news reports were used, no
human ethics committee approval was required.
Results
From 1979 until and including 1996 (ie, the 18 years prior to
enactment of the ban on rapid-fire firearms), there were 13
mass fatal shootings (involving ≥5 victims) in Australia. In
these events, 104 victims were killed and at least another 52
wounded (Table 1). From 1997 to May 2016 (ie, 20 years
after the 1996 massacre and 19 years after enactment of the
ban), no mass fatal shootings have occurred in Australia.
Intentional deaths from firearm discharge and total non-
firearm suicides and homicides in Australia between 1979 and
2013 are presented in Table 2. Overall deaths due to firearms
declined during this period. From 1979-1996, the mean an-
nual rate of total firearm deaths was 3.6 (95% CI, 3.3-3.9) per
100 000population,andfrom1997-2013,themeanrateoftotal
firearm deaths was 1.2 (95% CI, 1.0-1.4) per 100 000 popula-
tion. From 1979-1996, the mean annual rate of total nonfire-
arm suicide and homicide deaths was 10.6 (95% CI, 10.0-11.2)
per 100 000 population, and from 1997-2013, the mean rate
was 11.8 (95% CI, 11.3-12.3) per 100 000 population.
Total Firearm and Nonfirearm Suicide and Homicide Deaths
Overall suicide and homicide deaths from firearm involve-
ment for the period 1979 to 2013 are reported in the Figure,
panels G, H, and I. An increasing trend in total deaths (total
homicide and suicide deaths) in the years 1979-1996 was fol-
lowed by a decreasing trend in 1997-2013 (Figure, panel G),
resulting in a negative ratio of annual trends (RT = 0.975;
95% CI, 0.968-0.983) but not a negative step change
(RL = 0.991; 95% CI, 0.918-1.071) (Table 3). Although total
firearm deaths were already declining in 1979-1996, the trend
accelerated in 1997-2013 (Figure, H), resulting in a negative
ratio of trends (RT = 0.981; 95% CI, 0.968-0.993) as well as a
negative step change (RL = 0.669; 95% CI, 0.589-0.760)
(Table 3). The annual rate of total nonfirearm deaths was
increasing in 1979-1996 but declined in the period 1997-2013
(Figure, I), although only after an initial positive step change.
This resulted in a negative ratio of trends (RT = 0.966; 95%
CI, 0.958-0.973) but a nonsignificant step change
(RL = 1.054; 95% CI, 0.974-1.141) (Table 3).
Total Suicide Deaths
Total (firearm + nonfirearm) suicide annual death rates had
been increasing by a mean of 1.0% per year before the intro-
duction of the gun control laws, for an overall mean of 12.3
(95% CI, 11.9-12.7) per 100 000 population, but declined by a
mean of 1.5% per year after the introduction of the 1996 gun
laws (Table 3), for an overall mean of 11.7 (95% CI, 11.1-12.3)
per 100 000 (Figure, A). The ratio of the prelaw-to-postlaw
trends was statistically significant (RT = 0.975; 95% CI,

0.968-0.982), but the step change was not statistically sig-
nificant (RL = 1.004; 95% CI, 0.931-1.083) (Table 3).
Total Homicide Deaths
Total (firearm + nonfirearm) homicide annual death rates
had been decreasing by a mean of 0.3% per year before the
introduction of the gun control laws for an overall mean of
1.93 (95% CI, 1.86-2.00) per 100 000 population, but this
decline accelerated to a mean of 3.1% per year after the
introduction of the 1996 gun laws (Table 3) for an overall
mean of 1.29 (95% CI, 1.17-1.43) per 100 000 (Figure, D). The
ratio of the prelaw-to-postlaw trends was statistically sig-
nificant (RT = 0.972; 95% CI, 0.958-0.986), but there was no
significant step change (RL = 0.908; 95% CI, 0.784-1.050)
(Table 3).
Firearm Suicides
Firearm suicides represent the largest component cause of
total intentional firearm deaths in Australia (83.9% between
1979-2013) (Table 2). In the 18 years 1979-1996, the mean
annual rate of firearm suicide was 3.0 (95% CI, 2.8-3.3)
per 100 000 population. In the 17 years following the
announcement of the new gun laws, this declined to a mean
of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.87-1.13) per 100 000. The rate of firearm
suicide was declining by an average of 3% per year before
gun law reforms, and this decline increased to 4.8% per year
after the introduction of revised gun laws (Figure, B;
Table 3). The ratio of trend estimates was 0.981 (95% CI,
0.970-0.993). There was evidence of a step change in the
level of firearm-related suicide deaths (RL = 0.652; 95% CI,
0.582-0.731) (Table 3).
Firearm Homicides
In the 18 years 1979-1996, the mean annual rate of firearm ho-
micide was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.51-0.63) per 100 000 population.
In the 17 years following the announcement of the new gun
laws, this rate declined to 0.20 (95% CI, 0.17-0.25) per 100 000
persons. The rate of firearm homicide was declining by a mean
of3%peryear;thisrateofdeclineacceleratedtoameanof5.5%
per year after the introduction of new gun laws, although this
change was not statistically significant (RT = 0.975; 95% CI,
0.949-1.001) (Figure, E; Table 3). The ratio of trends in annual
death rate was slightly reduced when the mass homicides that
occurred during 1979-1996 were removed (RT = 0.985; 95% CI,
0.962-1.009). In addition, there was a nonsignificant nega-
tive step change (RL = 0.769; 95% CI, 0.590-1.004) (Table 3).
Nonfirearm Suicides
The rate of total nonfirearm suicides increased by a mean of
2.3% per year before the introduction of the gun control laws,
for an overall mean of 9.2 (95% CI, 8.7-9.8) per 100 000 popu-
lation, but declined by a mean of 1.2% per year after the intro-
duction of the 1996 gun laws, for an overall mean of 10.7 (95%
CI, 10.3-11.2) per 100 000 (Figure, C; Table 3). The ratio of the
prelaw-to-postlaw trends was statistically significant
(RT = 0.965; 95% CI, 0.958-0.973), but there was no statisti-
cally significant step change (RL = 1.070; 95% CI, 0.988-
1.159) (Table 3). The data do not support any suicide method
substitution hypothesis.
Nonfirearm Homicides
The rate of total nonfirearm homicides increased by a mean
of 0.9% per year before the introduction of gun control

a Definitions of “mass fatal shooting” have ranged from 3 to 5 victims killed by
gunshot.8,10,11 To exclude most of the more common firearm-related spousal
and family violence killings, “mass fatal shooting” is defined here as one in
which �5 firearm-related homicides are committed by 1 or 2 perpetrators in
proximate events in a civilian setting, not counting any perpetrators killed by
their own hand or otherwise. There were 2 neighbor-dispute homicides with 3
victims each (April 29, 2011, at Hectorville, South Australia, and October 22,
2014, at Logan, Victoria) and 1 family murder-suicide with 4 victims and
a perpetrator suicide (September 8, 2015, at Lockhart, New South Wales).
Details of each case were collected from police and coroners’files,
by personal communication with police and counsel involved, or as a last
resort from corroborating newspaper reports. Although no mass shootings
occurred in 1979-1980, Table 1 covers the same time span as the data in
the Results section.

a Data were provided by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW)
National Injury Surveillance Unit using records from the AIHW National
Mortality Database. Deaths recorded in the database were certified
by coroners; registered by Registries of Births, Deaths, and Marriages;
and cause-coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Inclusion criteria:
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), codes

Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision
(ICD-10), codes for suicide, X60-X84; and homicide, X85-Y09. The dip
in case numbers in the 3 years before 2006 is largely due to a change in data
collection method, which resulted in some cases being coded to other
categories, mostly accidental injury due to firearms. For further information,

hypothesis.
Discussion
In the 20 years (May 1996-May 2016) since the gun law
reforms and buyback programs, no mass shootings (ie, ≥5
victims) have occurred in Australia. In addition, there was a
more rapid decline in total firearm deaths after gun law
reforms (1997-2013) compared with before gun law reforms
(1979-1996). The prelaw reform decline in firearm suicides
increased significantly after the reforms, and the decline in

The shape of the fitted lines involves 2 components. One component of interest
is how much the slopes of the change in annual death rates differ between the
periods before and after the gun law enactment (vertical dotted lines).
Although it can be difficult to judge the magnitude from the graph itself, this is
quantified in the RT column of Table 3, which provides estimates of the relative
slopes (ratio: postlaw slope to prelaw slope) of the postlaw-to-prelaw trends in
annual death rates. A ratio <1.0 indicates a stronger decline in annual death
rates after the introduction of new gun laws compared with before. The second
component of interest is the change in level of death rate, which is reported in
the RL column of Table 3. This value represents the ratio of death rate at the
start of the period 1997 onward to the death rate at the end of the period up to
1996. The distinction between these 2 components is illustrated by comparing
panel C (nonfirearm suicide) and panel F (nonfirearm homicide). From C, the
positive upward trend in annual death rates becomes negative shortly after the
introduction of gun laws (hence, ratio of trends in Table 3 is <1.0), but the death
rate immediately after gun law introduction is higher than immediately before
(hence, the ratio of levels is >1.0). The y axis shown in blue indicates the range of
deaths of 0 to 2.5 per 100 000 population.

firearm homicides also increased, although this did not
reach statistical significance. Total suicides (all methods
including firearms) increased by a mean of 1% per year
before the introduction of the 1996 gun laws and decreased
by a mean of 1.5% per year after the introduction of the new
gun laws. Although the annual trend in total homicide was
slightly declining in 1979-1996 by less than 1%, this trend
accelerated to a 3.1% decline after the introduction of gun
control laws (1997-2013). The ratio of the prelaw-to-postlaw
trends was statistically significant for both total suicide
(P < .001) and total homicide (P < .001) (Table 3).
Although the mean annual rates of total nonfirearm sui-
cides and homicides were lower from 1979-1996 compared
with mean annual rates from 1997-2013, the rates increased
by an average of 2.1% per year before gun law reform and
decreased by an average of 1.4% per year after gun law
reform (Figure, C). In addition, the post-1996 decrease in the
rates of nonfirearm suicide and homicide was larger than
the decreases for suicide and homicide involving firearms.
An examination of the decline in suicide in Australia
between 1994-2007 concluded that much of the decline was
explained by changes toward the use of less fatal methods.13
There was a decrease in suicide by motor vehicle exhaust,
which explained nearly half of the overall decline in suicide
deaths. Suicide using firearms had the highest fatality rate
(74%), and self-poisonings had the lowest rate at 1.4%. The
study noted that “the decline in firearm deaths over the
study period was due primarily to a decline in attempts;
lethality remained relatively flat.
”13
To our knowledge, no other Australian studies have
examined the decline in nonfirearm homicide deaths. How-
ever, this decline may reflect historical factors over the
period examined, such as improved trauma care for less
lethal assault methods and reduced times in victims access-
ing and receiving out-of-hospital and hospital emergency ser-
vices. For instance, a 1997 study14 of 2233 adults found that
92 of 764 cell phone users (12%) had used their phone to call
emergency services to a road crash and 46 (6%) to a nonroad
medical emergency. With increasing cell phone use over the
past 2 decades, it is plausible that ambulances will have
increasingly attended traumatic incidents like assaults and
suicide attempts earlier than in previous times when land-
lines were only or more commonly used to make such calls.
There have also been improvements in emergency care, and
the lower lethality of nonfirearm assault and suicide may
explain the greater reductions in nonfirearm homicide and
suicide rates. For example, a US study of the effect of emer-
gency care using data from the National Trauma Data Bank15
found that firearm injury was 1 factor predicting death after
admission and noted that prehospital fatalities were
excluded in such analyses: persons who sustain firearm
injuries are more likely to die both before and after hos-
pital admission than from suicide or homicide methods such
as self-poisoning, assault, stabbing, gas inhalation, or
hanging.13,16 However, these observations are speculative.
Considering that firearms have a very high lethality index
(or “completion rate”) in both homicide and suicide,16 it is
possible that had the gun law reforms not occurred, more
Australians contemplating suicide might have more easily
accessed firearms and completed suicide. The data in this
study show that the declining rate of suicide by firearm accel-
erated significantly after the 1996 gun laws, with no apparent
substitution to other lethal methods, or if there was substitu-
tion, it may have been into less lethal methods.

Despite a surge of postlaw gun buying to replace de-
stroyed semiautomatic and other rapid-fire weapons with
single-shot rifles and shotguns,17 in a trend that preceded the
Australian firearm buyback but seems to have been acceler-
ated by this initiative, the proportion of Australian house-
holds reporting private gun ownership declined by 75% be-
tween 1988 and 2005.18
We are unaware of any other nation that has enacted such
a substantial change in gun laws as has been implemented in
Australia. Comparative studies of Australia’
s experience with
broadly comparable nations would provide further evidence
of the effects of such law reform.
This study has several issues related to terminology and
limitations that should be considered in the interpretation
of these findings. First, there is no authoritative interna-
tional consensus on the definition of a “mass” fatal shoot-
ing. We defined mass shooting as a killing involving 5 or
more victims, not including the perpetrator. However, many
firearm deaths with more than 1 victim are domestic homi-
cides and murder-suicides. These commonly involve up to 3
victims, plus the suicide or police shooting of the perpetra-
tor. A footnote to Table 1 lists all 3 known fatal shooting
incidents in which 3 or 4 victims were killed with firearms
after 1996.
Second, the observational nature of the data in this
article precludes assigning causality between enactment of
the 1996 gun laws along with the buyback program and sub-
sequent elimination of mass shootings and reduction in
rates of total firearm-related deaths and gun-related suicide.
Even though the rates of firearm-related homicides and sui-
cides were declining before gun law reforms, banning rapid-
fire weapons, and removal of a substantial number of fire-
arms, it is plausible that reducing the availability of
weapons may have been related to the acceleration in the
rates of declines for these deaths after gun reform.
Third, data on unintentional (“accidental”) deaths in this
article were not included because the proportion of such
deaths in total firearm deaths in Australia is small (<5%) but
mainly because the main intent of the 1996 gun law reforms
was to prevent mass shootings. Homicide and suicide mor-
tality are associated with age and sex. The distribution of
these characteristics could have shifted over the period of
time reported. Because of the complexities of obtaining rel-
evant data and matching them meaningfully with the
death data, this shift in distribution has not been addressed
in this study.
Table 2 comprises case numbers from the ABS-coded
national death data collection, the official source of death
data in Australia. Some firearm deaths that are coded as
“accidental” in the official statistics (and were omitted
from Table 2) were assigned that intent status because the
relevant records in the National Coronial Information
System (NCIS), on which the ABS relied when coding the
cases, were not complete when inspected by the ABS.
Later inspection of the NCIS records showed that the intent
of most of these shooting deaths had by then been reclas-
sified as homicide or suicide, with some remaining
undetermined.12 The annual number of firearm deaths
coded as accidental in the official statistics but as homicide,
suicide, or undetermined intent in the finalized NCIS rec-
ords was about 20, 30, 40, and 40 per year, respectively,
from 2002 to 2005 (see Figure 4.18 of Harrison and
Henley12). Some data in the previous report on the tenth
anniversary of the gun law reforms8 have now slightly
changed, reflecting these updates from delayed coronial
findings.
A similar problem affected the initial release of data for the
deaths registered in 2006, which was processed by the ABS in
the same way that they had used for earlier years. Later, in rec-
ognition of the problem, the ABS processed the same set of
deaths again, by which time the NCIS records were more com-
plete.Intherevisedrelease(usedwhenpreparingTable1),most
firearm deaths that had been coded as accidental in the initial
release were coded as suicide or homicide. A revised method,
used by the ABS for registration years 2007 onwards, largely
overcomes this problem.12
Conclusions
Following the enactment of gun law reforms in Australia in
1996, there were no mass firearm killings through May 2016.
There was a more rapid decline in firearm deaths between 1997
and 2013 compared with before 1997, but also a decline in total
nonfirearm suicide and homicide deaths of a greater magni-
tude. Because of this, it is not possible to determine whether
the change in firearm deaths can be attributed to the gun law
reforms.
