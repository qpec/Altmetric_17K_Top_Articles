IMPORTANCE Stroke remains a major predictor of mortality after transcatheter aortic valve
implantation (TAVI). Cerebral protection devices might reduce brain injury as determined by
diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI).
OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of a cerebral protection device on the number and
volume of cerebral lesions in patients undergoing TAVI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Investigator-initiated, single center, blinded,
randomized clinical trial in higher-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI at
the University of Leipzig Heart Center. Brain MRI was performed at baseline, 2 days, and 7
days after TAVI. Between April 2013 and June 2014, patients were randomly assigned to
undergo TAVI with a cerebral protection device (filter group) or without a cerebral protection
device (control group). The last 1-month follow-up occurred in July 2014.
INTERVENTIONS TAVI with or without a cerebral protection device (filter system).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was the numerical difference in new
positive postprocedure DWMRI brain lesions at 2 days after TAVI in potentially protected
territories. The first hierarchical secondary outcome was the difference in volume of new
lesions after TAVI in potentially protected territories.
RESULTS Among the 100 enrolled patients, mean (SD) age was 80.0 (5.1) years in the filter
group (n = 50) and 79.1 (4.1) years in the control group (n = 50), and the mean (SD)
procedural risk scores (logistic EuroScores) were 16.4% (10.0%) in the filter group and 14.5%
(8.7%) in the control group. For the primary end point, the number of new lesions was lower
in the filter group, 4.00 (interquartile range [IQR], 3.00-7.25) vs 10.00 (IQR, 6.75-17.00) in
the control group (difference, 5.00 [IQR, 2.00-8.00]; P < .001). For the first hierarchical
secondary end point, new lesion volume after TAVI was lower in the filter group (242 mm3
[95% CI, 159-353]) vs in the control group (527 mm3 [95% CI, 364-830]) (difference,
234 mm3 [95% CI, 91-406]; P = .001). Considering adverse events, 1 patient in the control
group died prior to the 30-day visit. Life-threatening hemorrhages occurred in 1 patient in the
filter group and 1 in the control group. Major vascular complications occurred in 5 patients in
the filter group and 6 patients in the control group. One patient in the filter group and 5 in the
control group had acute kidney injury, and 3 patients in the filter group had a thoracotomy.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI,
the use of a cerebral protection device reduced the frequency of ischemic cerebral lesions in
potentially protected regions. Larger studies are needed to assess the effect of cerebral
protection device use on neurological and cognitive function after TAVI and to devise
methods that will provide more complete coverage of the brain to prevent new lesions.

T
ranscatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using the
balloon-expandable SAPIEN valve has been shown to
be superior to standard medical therapy in inoperable
patients.1Additionally,morerecentdatasupportthatTAVIwith
the self-expanding CoreValve prosthesis is associated with
lower mortality than surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR)
in high-risk patients.2 However, although the clinical out-
comes of TAVI have improved considerably during the last
decade,3,4 stroke, which is associated with a 3-fold increase in
mortality following SAVR or TAVI, remains an important
concern.5-7 Adding to this concern is the observation that is-
chemic lesions, as determined by diffusion-weighted mag-
neticresonanceimaging(DWMRI),arefoundinasmanyas80%
of TAVI patients.8-11
Numerous devices have been developed to protect the
brain from injury caused by embolic debris during TAVI.12-15
The recently published DEFLECT III trial,15 which evaluated
the TriGuard HDH embolic deflection device (Keystone Heart)
during TAVI in patients with severe aortic stenosis, was de-
signed to evaluate potential end points and benchmark event
rates to inform the design considerations of a pivotal random-
ized study. Although the authors reported a numerical reduc-
tion in a number of DWMRI-related end points in deflector-
treated patients, none of these changes reached statistical
significance.15 Hence, clear evidence of the efficacy of any em-
bolic protection device in TAVI is still missing.
Methods
Study Design
The Claret Embolic Protection and TAVI (CLEAN-TAVI) trial
was a single-center, blinded, RCT performed at the Heart
Center at the University of Leipzig, Germany (study protocol
in Supplement 1). All patients provided written informed
consent.
Patient Selection
Symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis were eli-
gible for inclusion in the study if they were considered at
increased risk for SAVR as determined by the heart team.
Computed tomography scans were performed to determine
the size of the aortic annulus, the access vessels, the brachio-
cephalic trunk, and the left common carotid artery. Exclusion
criteria were an anatomy unsuitable for a safe TAVI, preexist-
ing permanent pacemaker, stroke within the last 12 months,
carotid artery stenosis of more than 70%, significant stenosis
of the right subclavian artery or the brachiocephalic trunk,
expected nonadherence to follow-up visits, participation in
another clinical study, severe renal failure (glomerular filtra-
tion rate [GFR]<30 mL/min/1.73 m2 body surface area), or
pregnancy.
Randomization and Masking
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the control or filter
group using concealed and black laminated identical enve-
lopes. Physicians and nurses performing the neurological and
neurocognitive tests were otherwise not involved in the study
or patient treatment and were blinded to group assignment.
MRIs were anonymized using the patients’study numbers and
transferred to a central MRI core laboratory for analysis to en-
sure blinding of the core laboratory.
Study Procedures
TAVI Treatment
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to undergo transfemo-
ral TAVI using the Medtronic CoreValve (Medtronic) self-
expanding prosthesis without (control group) or with (filter
group) a cerebral protection device using the Claret Montage
Dual Filter System (Claret Medical Inc). All of the procedures
were performed under conscious sedation by the same heart
team. Heparin was given until the target activated clotting
time of 250 seconds was achieved. In the filter group, the
cerebral protection device was deployed as described
previously.12,13 Briefly, the proximal filter was deployed in the
brachiocephalic trunk, covering all areas of the brain sup-
plied by the right vertebral and carotid arteries; the distal fil-
ter was released in the left carotid artery. The left vertebral
artery, which usually originates from the left subclavian
artery, remained unprotected, as did the brain areas fed by
this vessel. Based on the structure of the circle of Willis, the
brain was separated into 28 segments corresponding to 14
left- and 14 right-sided arteries, to provide a detailed map of
the territories fed by left and right cerebral tributaries. The
volume of the brain that was potentially protected was 74%,
24% was partially protected, and 2% was unprotected. A
detailed description of the segmentation of the brain, the
respective nutritive support, and the level of protection is
provided in eTable 1 (in Supplement 2). Following predilata-
tion in all patients, TAVI was carried out per usual practice, as
described previously.3 The access vessel was closed and the
patients were transferred to the intensive care unit for fur-
ther monitoring.
Follow-up assessments were performed at 2 days and 7
days after TAVI and were identical to the preprocedural tests.
In addition to MRI, follow-up included serial neurological and
neurocognitive assessments, New York Heart Association clas-
sification, echocardiography, and documentation of adverse
events and study end points.
Key Points
Question Does the use of a cerebral protection device during
transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) reduce the amount of
ischemic brain injury as determined by magnetic resonance imaging?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 100
patients (n = 50 in each treatment group) with severe aortic
stenosis undergoing TAVI, the use of a cerebral embolic protection
device during the procedure significantly reduced the number of
cerebral lesions in the potentially protected brain regions to 4
(interquartile range [IQR], 3.00-7.25) in the filter group vs 10
(IQR, 6.75-17.00) in the control group.
Meaning Among patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing
TAVI, the use of a cerebral protection device reduced the frequency
of ischemic cerebral lesions in potentially protected regions.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Brain MRI assessments were performed at baseline and at 2
and 7 days. MRI scans were analyzed in blinded fashion by
the MRI core laboratory (Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Cen-
ter, Buffalo, NY). The MRI protocol included diffusion-
weighted images (DWIs) acquired with a 2D-echo planar
sequence, high-resolution T1-weighted images acquired with
an MP-RAGE sequence, and B0 field maps acquired with a
manufacturer-based dual-echo gradient echo sequence.16-18
All examinations were acquired on a 3T scanner (Magnetom
Verio) except for 11 patients who were pacemaker dependent
following TAVI. For these patients, a 1.5T system (Intera by
Philips) was used. MRI outcomes included calculation of
number and volume of new DWIs (2 and 7 days) by subtrac-
tion of the existing baseline lesions in the whole brain and
within predefined vascular territories (ie, the potentially pro-
tected and partially protected areas). None of the patients
had any endovascular diagnostic tests or treatments per-
formed between the baseline MRI and the TAVI. The details
of the MRI procedures are provided in eTable 1 and the eAp-
pendix in Supplement 2.
Neurological and Neurocognitive Assessment
An attending physician who was at that time being trained as
an internist or cardiologist or an exercise scientist (PhD) was
experienced in conducting neurological assessments in re-
search studies and was certified to administer the National In-
stitutesofHealthStrokeScale(NIHSS)andthemodifiedRankin
Scale. They were blinded to group assignment.
Study End Points
The primary end point was the numerical reduction in posi-
tive postprocedure DWMRI brain lesions relative to baseline
at 2 days following TAVI in potentially protected territories.
Only new lesions that were visible at 2 days, 7 days, or both
but not present in the baseline scans were analyzed. Second-
ary end points included serial volumetric and numerical re-
ductions in positive postprocedure DWMRI–perfused brain le-
sions at 2 and 7 days, as well as the results of serial neurological
and neurocognitive assessments.
Statistical Analysis
The mean (SD) number of DWMRI lesions after TAVI was
reported as 5.9 (6.8) by Astarci et al11 and in a separate study
as 4.2 (6.5) by Fairbairn et al.10 However, Astarci et al11 used
3T-MRI infrequently, and all MRIs in the study by Fairbairn
et al10 were performed on a 1.5T scanner, which has a lower
sensitivity to detect smaller lesions. Because the current
study used a segmentation methodology to detect smaller
lesions (eAppendix in Supplement 2) and a 3T MRI in the
majority of the cases, it was anticipated that the absolute
lesion number would be higher than previously reported.
The primary hypothesis for clinically significant success was
that the cerebral protection device would provide a 50%
reduction in the number of positive DWMRI–perfused brain
lesions following TAVI at 2 days relative to baseline in poten-
tially protected territories. Given a standard deviation of 7
for the measure and assuming a drop-out rate of 16%, an
estimated total of 50 patients were required in each group
for the study to have a power of 90% at a 2-sided α level of
0.05. Because the device does not protect the entire brain,
the primary focus was on the territory where a potential fil-
ter effect could most reliably be detected.
Secondary efficacy end points were evaluated and
tested for statistical significance but only if the primary effi-
cacy end point was met. To preserve overall type I error, a
gatekeeping strategy was used in which secondary MRI end
points were tested. These 16 end points were tested in the
following order and only if the prior one on the list achieved
statistical significance: (1) day 2 DWMRI median total new
lesion volume within the potentially protected areas; (2) day
7 DWMRI median total new lesion number within the
potentially protected areas; (3) day 7 DWMRI median total
new lesion volume within the potentially protected areas;
(4) day 2 DWMRI total new lesion number in all territories
(entire brain); (5) day 2 DWMRI median total new lesion vol-
ume in all territories; (6) day 7 DWMRI total new lesion
number in all territories; (7) day 7 DWMRI median total new
lesion volume in all territories; (8) day 30 Flair MRI total
new lesion number in potentially protected territories;
(9) day 30 Flair MRI median total new lesion volume in
potentially protected territories; (10) day 2 Montreal Cogni-
tive Assessment and its subcomponents; (11) day 7 Montreal
Cognitive Assessment and its subcomponents; (12) day 2
modified Rankin Scale; (13) day 7 modified Rankin Scale;
(14) day 2 NIHSS; (15) day 7 NIHSS; and (16) periprocedural
high-intensity transient signals (HITS).
The secondary end points Montreal Cognitive Assess-
ment, modified Rankin Scale, NIHSS, high-intensity tran-
sient signals were considered exploratory and were reported
descriptively.
The primary end point analysis was performed according
to a modified intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, with all par-
ticipants analyzed in the group to which they were random-
ized, and including all participants in whom the investiga-
tional study procedure was attempted and for whom MRIs
were available at baseline and day 2. The same modified ITT
analysis was performed for the secondary MRI end points at
2 and 7 days. In sensitivity analysis to test for the effect of the
loss of values due to missing MRI data, a multiple imputation
was also performed. First, the Little’
s Missing Completely
at Random Test was performed to confirm a random distribu-
tion of missing values. Then, using the Markov chain
Monte Carlo method, missing values were imputed based
on the available data from the MRI assessments at 2 and 7
days, and the procedure was repeated 10 times to create 10
imputation sets.
Categorical variables were expressed as numbers, per-
centages, or both and were compared with use of the
Fisher exact test or the χ2 test as appropriate. Continuous
variables were expressed as mean (SD) values or median
interquartile (IQR) ranges and compared using an appropri-
ate parametric (Student t) test or nonparametric (Mann-
Whitney U) test. All tests were 2-sided and a P value of less
than .05 was considered statistically significant. Differences
between medians were estimated using the independent

Procedural Data
Procedural data are reported in Table 2. Procedural data
for patients included and not included in the primary end
point analysis are reported in eTable 5 and eTable 6 (in
Supplement 2). Radiation dose and amount of contrast dye
used during the procedure did not differ between the con-
trol and treatment groups. However, fluoroscopy time and
procedural time (defined as time from the first puncture
until the closure of the last access site) were longer in the fil-
ter group compared with the control group. There were 2
patients in whom neither of the filters could be deployed
due to significant tortuosity of the right subclavian artery or
the brachiocephalic trunk. In another 2 patients, it was
impossible to position the distal filter because of complex
anatomy, and in 1 patient, the correctly deployed filter dislo-
cated because of accidental pull-back of a jailed pigtail cath-
eter. Therefore, total device success was achieved in 46 of
50 patients (92%), total or partial device success in 48 of 50
(96%), and total procedural success in 45 patients (90%).
Three patients in the filter group underwent thora-
cotomy, 1 because of wire perforation of the left ventricle that
could not solely be solved by pericardiocentesis and 2 be-
cause of inability to release the transcatheter valve from the
delivery catheter. However, none of these thoracotomies ap-
peared to be related to the cerebral protection device. All 3 pa-
tients recovered and were alive at 30 days.
MRI End Points
In the potentially protected regions, the median new lesion
number at 2 days was lower in the filter group (4.00 [IQR,
3.00-7.25]) than in the control group (10.00 [IQR, 6.75-
17.00]) (difference, 5.00 [IQR, 2.00-8.00]; P < .001; Figure 2
and Table 3). Moreover, in the potentially protected regions,
new lesion volume was lower in the filter group, 242 mm3
(95% CI, 159-353) vs 527 mm3 (95% CI, 364-830), difference
234 mm3 (95% CI, 91-406), P = .001.
At 7 days, new lesion number in the potentially protected
areaswaslowerinthefilterthancontrolgroups,3.00(IQR1.00-
5.25) vs 7.00 (IQR 3.00-13.50), difference 3.00 (1.00-5.00),
P = .003. Likewise, at 7 days, new lesion volume in the poten-
tially protected areas was lower in the filter group, 101 mm3
(95% CI, 60-174)) vs 292 mm3 (95% CI, 181-515), difference
160 mm3 (95% CI, 57-281), P = .002, Figure 2, Table 3).
Similar effects were seen for the entire brain. At 2 days,
the median total new lesion number was lower in the filter
than control groups, 8.00 (IQR 5.00-12.00) vs 16.00 (IQR
9.75-24.25), difference 6.00 (IQR 3.00-10.00), P = .002; and
lesion volume was reduced, 466 mm3 (95% CI, 349-711)
compared with 800 mm3 (95% CI, 594-1407), difference 311
mm3 (95% CI, 66-580), P = .02, Figure 2, Table 3). In addi-
tion, at 7 days the median total new lesion number in the
entire brain was lower in the filter group, 5.00 lesions (IQR
2.75-8.00) compared with 10.00 lesions (IQR 3.00-18.00),
difference 4.00 (IQR 1.00-8.00), P = .009; and lesion vol-
ume was reduced, 205 mm3 (95% CI, 115-338) vs 472 mm3
(95% CI, 385-909), difference 240 mm3 (95% CI, 51-393),
P = .009, Figure 2, Table 3).
The comparison of the imputed data sets for the num-
ber and volume of new lesions in the potentially protected
areas, partially protected areas, and the entire brain at 2
and 7 days confirmed the lower values in the filter group
as compared with the control group and hence, the findings
of the modified intention-to-treat analysis eTable 7 in
Supplement 2).

Overall, by MRI at 2 days, 98% of the patients in the filter
group (48 of 49) and 98% of the patients in the control group
(44 of 45) were lesion positive. At 7 days, 98% of the patients
in the filter group (44 of 45) and 95% of the patients in the con-
trol group (41 of 43) were lesion positive.
Neurological Outcomes
At 2 and 7 days in the intention-to-treat analysis, the number
of patients with neurological symptoms indicative of stroke
was 5 in the filter group and 5 in the control group; all were
minor and nondisabling in nature (eTable 8 in Supplement 2).
None of the patients had a transient ischemic attack since all
patients with symptoms had positive brain imaging and were
classified as stroke positive according to VARC2. At 2, 7, and
30 days, stroke frequencies were similar between both groups.
Secondary exploratory neurological outcomes were re-
ported in eTable 8 and eTable 9 (in Supplement 2).
Procedure Related and Other Outcomes
The clinical outcomes according to VARC-2 (the Valve Aca-
demic Research Consortium) are reported in eTable 10 (in
Supplement2).Thecontrolandfiltergroupsdidnotdifferwith
regard to the incidence of any complications. One patient in
the control group died from diastolic heart failure, therefore
30-day mortality for the control group was 2%, for the filter
group was 0%, and for the entire cohort was 1%. The median
number of periprocedural high-intensity transient signals was
3196 (IQR, 2522-4010) in the filter group and 3674 (IQR, 2551-
5217) in the control group.
TAVI resulted in improvement in aortic valve function and
symptoms in both the control and filter groups (eFigure 1 and
eTable 11 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
TAVI was associated with DWMRI-positive brain lesions, in-
dicative of ischemic brain injury in almost every patient. How-
ever, use of a cerebral protection device during TAVI signifi-
cantly reduced the number and volume of new lesions in the
potentially protected regions and in the entire brain.
Effect of TAVI on Brain Structure as Determined by MRI
The effect of TAVI on the brain has been studied applying
DWMRIinanonrandomizedfashion.8-11Comparisonoftheval-
ues obtained in the control group of this study with previous
studiesislimitedbecausepreviousstudiesuseddifferenttrans-
catheter heart valves, lacked consistent baseline MRI (requir-
ing the assumption that all lesions after TAVI are necessarily
new lesions), used a lower MRI scanner strength field (1.5 vs
3T), and differed in time points of MRI assessments after TAVI
and the definition of MRI end points.8-11,15 The new lesion vol-
ume observed in patients in the control group was consistent
with values recently reported in the DEFLECT III study.15 How-
ever,inthecontrolgroup,thenumberofDWMRI-positivebrain
lesions was higher compared with previous trials, most likely
because of the following reasons: (1) the subtraction tech-
nique applied in this study enhanced the detection of smaller
lesions; (2) 3T-MRI was used, which has a higher sensitivity
compared with 1.5T-MRI; (3) and the first MRI after TAVI was
performed at 2 days postintervention, which was earlier than
in previous trials.8-11 The latter point is of importance in the
interpretation of trial results because this study provides, for
the first time to our knowledge, evidence that new lesion num-
ber and volume were numerically higher at 2 days compared
with 7 days after TAVI. Hence, the expected lesion number and
volume will be smaller in studies in which postprocedural MRI
was performed late after TAVI (eg, at 5-7 days) in comparison
with studies using an early MRI (eg, at 2-3 days).
The high percentage of patients who were lesion positive
in the filter group may initially appear surprising, but other
studies have found similar phenomena. Although 25% of pa-
tientswerecompletelylesionfreeintheDEFLECTIIItrial,free-
dom from lesions was confined to patients treated with an
Edwards valve; all CoreValve–treated patients had cerebral
lesions despite the use of the TriGuard device designed to

protect the entire brain from embolic injury.15 In the
ADVANCE trial, within the first months after TAVI using the
CoreValveexclusively,halfofthereportedstrokesoccurredbe-
tween day 2 and day 30 and the other half on the day of the
procedure or the first postprocedural day, suggesting that
the risk of stroke is not limited to the procedure itself.2,19,20
This is consistent with DEFLECT III, in which 10% of patients
experienced new lesions between the postprocedural MRI and
the assessment at 30 days.15 Nevertheless, the filter can only
protect the brain during the TAVI procedure, which usually
takes less than 1 hour and represents only 2% of the first
48 hours after which the first MRI was performed in this
study. Based on the analyzed material captured and removed
by the filters, eg, old and fresh thrombus, endothelium, ath-
eromatous plaque, valve tissue, and calcium (eFigure 2 in
Supplement 2), it becomes evident that causes of cerebral in-
jury are multifactorial and that the embolic risk does not re-
solve immediately at the end of the TAVI procedure.12 How-
ever, despite the delayed appearance and multifactorial
etiology of neurological events after TAVI, potentially dilut-
ing the treatment effect of the filter, the difference between
thefilterandthecontrolgroupswithregardtotheprimaryMRI
end point was notable, underlining the value of cerebral filter
protection to prevent brain injury during TAVI.
Effect of Filter Protection on Neurological Outcome
Data from RCTs suggest that the rate of neurological impair-
ment shortly after TAVI can be greater than 5%.1,5,6 The re-
sults of the DeNOVO study indicate that neurological events
maybedetectedmuchmorefrequently(≤17%ofpatients)when
the assessment is prospectively performed by skilled
personnel.7 The DeNOVO study included prospective neurolo-
gist assessments as well as MRI, which was important to con-
firm whether minor or transient symptoms were strokes.7 An-
other finding of DeNOVO was that larger lesions were more
likely to be symptomatic.7 In the current study, applying pro-
spective assessment by NIHSS-certified personnel, symp-
tomsindicativeofstrokewerefoundin5patientsineachgroup
(10% of the entire study cohort). However, this study was not
powered to assess differences in stroke rates between groups.
Inthisstudy,symptomsweremildandnoneofthestrokeswere
major or disabling.
Based on DWMRI findings, numerous patients had cere-
bral lesions consistent with infarcts in the absence of obvious
functional impairments. A clear association between the total
volume of cerebral lesions and the occurrence of neurologi-
cal symptoms has previously been shown, but the long-term
effect of subclinical brain lesions after TAVI is yet unknown.8-11
Data from other settings suggest that the presence of subclini-
cal brain infarcts is associated with several adverse neurologi-
cal and cognitive consequences and precedes the occurrence
of major stroke.12,21,22 However, this association has not yet
been shown for procedural subclinical infarcts, and further
studies are necessary to address this issue.
The NIHSS and the modified Rankin Scale were used to
assess neurological function before and after the interven-
tion and revealed no obvious differences between the filter
and control groups. However, a comprehensive assessment
should also focus on neurocognitive function. Therefore,
additional research is required to specifically define end
points that reliably describe neurocognitive function before
and after TAVI.

Technical Procedural Aspects and the Cerebral Protection
Device in Perspective: Comparison With Other Devices
Designed to Protect the Brain
In addition to the cerebral protection device used in this
study, there are other protection devices that have received
the CE mark (Conformité Européene [indicates European
conformity]) in Europe. However, the results of recent stud-
ies evaluating their effect on brain injury are conflicting.14,15
Data from a recent hypothesis-generating trial (N=85
patients) indicated lower absolute volume of cerebral lesions
after TAVI in patients whose brain had been protected with
the deflector type Triguard (Keystone Heart) device com-
pared with control patients, but this did not reach statistical
significance.15 In addition, the study failed to demonstrate
any difference in the number of DWMRI perfused lesions
between the control and the deflector-protected groups of
the study. Another recent study using the Embrella device
(Edwards Lifesciences) also failed to elucidate any protective
effect.14 Data from other rigorous, hypothesis-driven, RCTs
like the CLEAN-TAVI study are missing. Therefore, it is cur-
rently unclear whether other types of cerebral protection
devices (ie, deflectors) protect the brain and downstream
organs as well as filter-based devices, which capture and
remove the embolic debris.
The procedural time was 18 minutes longer in the cere-
bral protection device group compared with the control
group because of the additional time required to obtain arte-
rial access on the right arm for device positioning and filter
deployment, as well as filter recapture and device removal.
However, to understand the ease of use in the general patient
population undergoing TAVI, complex anatomical cases were
not excluded from this study. Despite overall good device
performance, several procedures involving particularly com-
plex anatomical situations with excessive kinking of the bra-
chiocephalic artery or an elongated left common carotid
artery were challenging and more time consuming and
account for the longer procedure times. Nevertheless, over
the course of the study period, a decline in deployment time
was observed. It may therefore be extrapolated that with
increased operator experience, in conjunction with device
refinements, it may be possible to achieve procedural times
almost as short as in the control group.
Limitations
This was a single-center study, which used only 1 of the vari-
ous available TAVI devices in all patients. All of the proce-
dures were performed by the same experienced heart team to
eliminate the potential bias of a procedural learning curve.
Therefore, the results cannot be necessarily generalized to a
broader patient population, other transcatheter heart valves,
oramulticentersetting.Inourproof-of-conceptstudy,wecon-
sidered a 50% reduction in new lesion number between the 2
groups a success; however, the clinical relevance of this re-
duction in an imaging marker of brain injury is uncertain and
requiresfurtherstudies.Moreover,apartfromtheprimaryMRI
end point, all other findings, particularly the neurological and
neurocognitive outcome measures, can only be considered hy-
pothesis generating, especially because these were not per-
formed by a neurologist and no routine neurological assess-
ment was performed at 3- month follow-up. In addition, we
cannot rule out the possibility that the use of 1.5T-MRI fol-
low-up in some patients affected results, although it appears
to be unlikely.
The fact that this cerebral protection device does not pro-
tect the left vertebral circulation is a limitation, but at the time
ofthestudydesign,thiscerebralprotectiondevicewastheonly
device available. Knowing the shortcomings of the device, the
primary focus of the study was a brain region most likely not
influenced by emboli originating from the left vertebral ar-
tery circulation, in order to understand if cerebral protection
could work. In the filter group, a protective effect on MRI para-
meters was detectable for the entire brain despite the current
device limitations. Nevertheless, from a clinician’
s point of
view, device refinement, enabling complete cerebral protec-
tion, is required.
Furthermore, because of the nature of the procedure,
the interventional team could not be blinded. Therefore, it
is possible that differences in the management of the con-
trol group vs the filter group during the TAVI procedure
might have affected the results. Nevertheless, all proce-
dures were conducted following standard procedural rules
defined for TAVI at our institution, reducing the likelihood
of any such effect.
Conclusions
Among patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI,
the use of a cerebral protection device reduced the frequency
of ischemic cerebral lesions in potentially protected regions.
Larger studies are needed to assess the effect of cerebral pro-
tection device use on neurological and cognitive function af-
ter TAVI and to devise methods providing more complete cov-
erage of the brain to prevent new lesions.
