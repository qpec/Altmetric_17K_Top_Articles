Abstract
Background: Patients not attending to clinic appointments (no-show) significantly affects delivery, cost of care and
resource planning. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence, predictors and economic consequences of patient no-shows.
Method: This is a retrospective cohort study using administrative databases for fiscal years 1997–2008. We searched
administrative databases for no-show frequency and cost at a large medical center. In addition, we estimated no-show
rates and costs in another 10 regional hospitals. We studied no-show rates in primary care and various subspecialty
settings over a 12-year period, the monthly and seasonal trends of no-shows, the effects of implementing a reminder
system and the economic effects of missed appointments.
Results: The mean no-show rate was 18.8 % (2.4 %) in 10 main clinics with highest occurring in subspecialist clinics.
No-show rate in the women clinic was higher and the no-show rate in geriatric clinic was lower compared to general
primary care clinic (PCP). The no-show rate remained at a high level despite its reduction by a centralized phone
reminder (from 16.3 % down to 15.8 %). The average cost of no-show per patient was $196 in 2008.
Conclusions: Our data indicates that no-show imposed a major burden on this health care system. Further,
implementation of a reminder system only modestly reduced the no-show rate.

Background
Healthcare systems consumed 16 % of the U.S. Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) in 2007. Its share of GDP is
projected to reach 19.5 % by 2017 [1]. To confront rising
costs, limited resource capacities, and burgeoning de-
mands facing U.S. healthcare providers, efficiently using
clinical resources is critical. A major obstacle in cost-
effective health care delivery and patient safety is no-
show. Patient no-show is defined as a patient who does
not appear for the scheduled appointment.
The extent and the cost of no-shows are widely stud-
ied. In a community hospital setting, Clark [2] reported
an average no-show rate of 62 appointments per day and
an estimated annual cost of $3 million. In a training hos-
pital setting, Xakellis and Bennett [3] reported a 25 %
no-show rate and a 31 % late arrival to appointments.
Moore and colleagues [4] found that no-shows and
cancellations represented 31.1 % of overall scheduled ap-
pointments among approximately 45,000 patients per
year at a large family practice center with an estimated
total annual revenue shortfall of 3 % to 14 %. Further,
several studies found no-show rates of as low as 3 % and
as high as 80 % [5–12].
Providers use different methods to reduce the patient
no-show, including reminder procedures, penalization,
and overbooking. The success of the methods is not
clearly determined. Satiani and colleagues [13] reported
that automated reminder systems did not significantly
reduce the no-show rate. Hixon and colleague [14]
found no difference in no-show rates when clinics use
reminder systems to reduce no-show.
Delayed testing potentially puts patients in danger.
Missed screening or patient no-show may results in de-
layed disease detection. Reducing no-show rates can di-
minish cost and improve quality of health care delivery.

 and the treatment selected is not affect by the patients’
income. For researchers, the VHA provides a unique op-
portunity to study issues related to the delivery of health
care system. Users of VHA system receive almost all of
their care from VHA and comprehensive nationwide da-
tabases are used to record all impatient and outpatient
visits.
In this study, we investigated the extent of no-show
and factors such as hospital size, gender, and age that
may affect it. We also calculated consequences and ex-
amined the effect of implementing different methods on
reducing no-show rates in a large tertiary VHA medical
center in Houston with several satellite clinics in more
remote areas. The study of no show in this population is
unique as VHA is one of the largest government health-
care systems in USA with no penalty for no show.
Methods
This is a retrospective review of information compiled in
administrative databases for a 12-year period. This study
was approved by the local institutional review board and
local Veterans Affairs research and development (R&D)
committee.
Data collection
The Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC)
at Houston, Texas, serves more than 76,000 Veterans in
southeast Texas. Further, it operates four additional satellite
outpatient clinics in areas remote to Houston.
Because of the large number of visits each year, in the
first part of our study, we focused on the no-show data
for the last 12 (fiscal year 1997–2008) years in 10 main
clinics including Audiology, Cardiology, Dermatology,
Eye Care, Gastroenterology, Mental Health, Orthopedics,
Podiatry, Primary Care, and Urology. Each fiscal year
starts on October of the preceding year and ends on last
day of September of that year. In the second part of study,
for statistical and economical analysis, all the no-show
data between fiscal year 2006 to 2008 were extracted and
analyzed.
Statistical and economical analysis methods
This study focused on outpatient appointments. If a pa-
tient showed up for his or her appointment, the visit was
classified as a “completed appointment (CA).” A Missed
appointment (MA) was the categorization assigned where
a patient did not come to the appointment. MAs are pro-
duced by several reasons including clinic cancellation,
patient cancellation, or patient no- show. We define a no-
show event as a patient that did not appear for the ap-
pointment or cancelled the appointment so late (usually
on the day of the appointment) that scheduling another
patient to that time slot was not feasible. The total
number of no-show events is calculated as the sum of
all no-shows. The no-show rate was calculated as the
proportion of the total no-shows to the number of all
appointments.
We used SAS9.2 (SAS, Inc., Cary, NC) for the analysis.
We summarized descriptive statistics as mean and
standard deviation and investigated the predictive value
of various factors including demographic (age and gender)
and clinic assignment characteristics (group vs. individual-
ized appointment in mental health), hospital size, and ap-
pointment time-of-day or day-of-week on no-show rate.
All the years in this study are fiscal years that start from
October of the previous year and end in September
of the desired year. All statistical hypothesis tests were
conducted at the 5 % level of significance. We used
Kolmogorov-Mirnov test for normality test and based on
the result of normality test, a suitable statistical analysis
(parameteric vs. nonparametric) was conducted. Also de-
sirable two-way ANOVA’s were applied to study different
factor effects.
For economic analysis, we used the average cost per en-
counter in MEDVAMC. The cost includes the total direct
costs (supplies and fixed direct) and indirect costs. If the
facility cannot fill a slot freed by a no-show patient, the
cost to pay staff (physician, nurse, and other adminis-
trative staff) remains. To estimate the marginal cost of a
no-show, we used the overall cost of visit per encounter
because the majority of the cost per encounter consists of
the staff costs. We were unable to consider some of the
freed slots that were filled by walk-in patients because the
data for each department were not available.
Results
No-show rates
During the study period, mean (SD) no-show rate was
18.8 % (2.4 %) in the 10 clinics. Gastro-intestinal (25.7 %
(4.1 %)) and Audiology (12.6 % (2.0 %)) had the highest
and the lowest no-show rates, respectively. Primary care
had the highest number of visits (an average of 185,945)
and consequently the highest total number of no-show pa-
tients (an average of 33,098 no-shows per year) per year.
Cost of no-show
We reviewed the average actual cost per encounter in
MEDVAMC and the corresponding national cost for 10
clinics in 2008. In general, the MEDVAMC has lower
costs per encounter than the national average costs. The
mean (SD) of actual cost per encounter in MEDVAMC
was $167 ($67). Podiatry ($58) and Primary Care ($274)
had the highest and the lowest actual cost per encounter,
respectively.
Using actual cost per encounter and number of no-
show in each clinic during the study period, we were
able to estimate marginal cost of the no-shows. In fiscal
year 2008, the estimate of the marginal cost of no-shows

 for the 10 clinics was $14.58 million while the lowest
and highest marginal cost happened in 1997 and 2005
with $10.48 and $16.65 million, respectively. To have a
better perspective of no-show rates and costs, we calcu-
lated the number of no-shows for all clinics during the
last 3 fiscal years. Table 1 represents the no-show rates
and costs for all clinics in MEDVAMC. The average cost
of no-show per patient was $196 in 2008.
Effects of important factors on no-show rates
Effect of gender on no-show
The women clinic at MEDVAMC provides primary care
to female veterans. To investigate the effect of gender on
no-show rates, we compared the no-show rate of the
women clinic and that of the primary care clinic (PCP),
because patients in women clinic are exclusively women
while overwhelming majority of patients in PCP are
men. We reviewed no-show rates for 60 months from
fiscal year 2004 to 2008. The no-show rates data in PCP
is not normally distributed (p < 0.01). Therefore, we ap-
plied sign-test to compare no-show rates in the two
clinics. Women clinic had higher no-show rate than
PCP (p <0.001). However, the no-show rate difference
between the women and the PCPs disappeared at last
two years of the study period.
Effect of age group on no-show
To identify the effect of age on the no-show rate, we
compared the no-show rate of geriatric PCP and that of
the general PCP. The geriatric PCP delivers service to
senior patients with age 65 or higher. We compared the
no-show data in geriatric PCP and PCP for 60 months
from 2004 to 2008. Using the sign-test, geriatric clinic
had less no-show than PCP (p < 0.001).
Effect of group treatment in mental health on no-show
To investigate the effect of group treatment on no-show
rate, we studied the no-show data in mental health individ-
ual and group clinic visits. We extracted the no-show rates
of both clinic visit types for 36 months from fiscal year
2006 to 2008. The sign-test showed that the group had
more no-show than the individual clinic visit (p < 0.001).
Effect of hospital size on no-show
The size of a hospital may have a significant effect on
the no-show rate, which can be measured by the number
of patient visits per year. Among the 10 hospitals in
South Central VA Health Care Network or VISN 16, the
largest VA hospital is the MEDVAMC with 76,745 patients
and the smallest one is the VA hospital in Alexandria, LA
with 24,541 patients (Fiscal Year or FY 2008). The no-show
rates shown in Fig. 1 are calculated based on the 10 main
clinics for the 10 hospitals in fiscal year 2008. It can be ob-
served that the MEDVAMC had the largest no-show rate
in 2008 among the 10 hospitals in Veteran Integrated
Service Network region 16 (VISN 16).
To examine the effects of different hospitals and differ-
ent clinics on no-show rate, we conducted a two-way
ANOVA test without replication for no-show rates among
10 different hospitals and the 10 clinics in each hospital
for fiscal year 2008. The no-show rate differed significantly
among the VA hospitals in VISN 16 and among different
clinics in the hospitals (p value for both <0.001).
Effect of appointment time on no-show
To study the effect of appointment times on the no-
show rates, 10 random weeks in 2008 were selected and
the no-shows rates were calculated for the 10 clinics for
the five weekdays. As shown in Fig. 2, the no-show rate
on Mondays was the highest, and then it dropped on
Tuesdays followed by a smooth increase until Fridays. A
two-way ANOVA test showed that the day of a week has
a small but statistically significant effect on no-show
(p = 0.03) and the type of clinic has a significant effect
on no-show (p-value < 0.001).
To study the effect of the month of an appointment
on no-show rate, we calculated the rate of no-shows in
each month for all the 10 clinics in fiscal year 2008 at
MEDVAMC. As shown in Fig. 3, the first 3 months in
2008 had the highest no-show rates with an average of
17.7 %. Then it decreased until September when it in-
creased suddenly and reached to 19.2 % as the highest
rate in the year. A two-way ANOVA test for month and
clinic showed that both the month of appointment and

(p-values < 0.001).
Effectiveness of different methods to reduce no-show
rates
MEDVAMC implemented methods to reduce the no-
show rate including a reminder-letter system and a cen-
tralized phone system.
Effectiveness of a reminder-letter system
A reminder-letter system is used to remind the patients
about their appointment times since 2004. Figure 4 dis-
plays the no-show rates for all the 10 clinics from 1997
to 2008. Although the rates of no-show increased unex-
pectedly in 2005 (from 18.2 % in 2004 to 19.1 % in
2005), the average of no-show rates for 4 years before
applying the reminder system was 18.17 % while the
mean decreased to 16.96 % for 4 consecutive years after
applying the reminder system.
To further study the effect of the reminder system on
no-show while adjusting for the effect of the months, we
designed a test to compare the no-show rates in all the
10 clinics for 12 months in 2004 with the same months
and clinics in 2005. Using sign test, the no-show rate
did not change after implementing the reminder sys-
tem (p = 0.70).
Effectiveness of a centralized phone system
To reduce no-show rates, the MEDVAMC applied a new
centralized phone system in October 2008. Using the cen-
tralized phone system, only one toll free number is used
to handle scheduling of appointments for all clinics.
To study the effect of the new phone system, all
no-show data were pulled out for the 10 clinics from
October 2008 to March 2009, a sample of 60 no-show
rates. To remove the monthly effect of appointment time,
we compared no-show in the six months with the same
months in the previous year, i.e., October 2007-March
2008. Figure 5 represents the trend of no-show rates be-
fore and after applying the new phone system. Using
sign-test, the no-show rates decreased significantly during
the first 6 months of applying the new phone system
(p value = 0.03). The average no-show rate in the 10 clinics
decreased from 16.3 % in 2008 to 15.2 % in 2009.

 Discussion
In this paper, we investigated the presence, extent and
economic consequences of patient no-show and ex-
plored the factors that may modulate no-show rates, and
the effect of implementing a reminder system to reduce
no-show rates. This study is one of the first comprehen-
sive studies on no-show rates at the VHA system. Our
data showed that no-show rate was high with significant
economic cost. Further, our study identified various fac-
tors including gender, age, visit related specialty, type of
the visit (group vs. individual), day of the week, and the
month of the visit as potential factors associated with
no-show. Our study is unique from several aspects. In
contrast to other no show studies, our study encom-
passes the largest number of patients. VHA is a govern-
ment run health care system with minimal or no cost to
eligible users. Thus, our data evaluates no show in a
health care system that is not costly to the user. Further,
the VHA patients are mostly older, men and with more
comorbid conditions that may affect the use of health
care and no show behavior.
The no-shows is a prevalent problem in many health
care systems [3–11]. Our data confirms the finding in
the VHA system. Our data indicated that women may
have higher no-show compared to men in the studied
health care setting. This finding is unique and needs to
be confirmed in another health care setting. It is likely
that during the study period, women used the Women
Clinic for women related health care rather than general
primary care.
The data showed that geriatric patients had more no-
show compared to general primary care patients. Potential
factors causing higher no-show in elderly may include age,
health status, and retirement status and difficulty with
transportation.
Our data showed that the no-show rate of the group
treatment in mental health is higher than that of the in-
dividual treatment. Potential factors causing a higher no-
show in group treatment may include unwillingness of
patients to attend and discuss their problems in front of
the others (lack of privacy) and different psychiatric con-
ditions treated in group versus individual visits. This
finding needs to be confirmed.
The clinic type in each VHA hospital in VISN 16 is a
significant factor on no-show rates, and VHA hospitals
with subspecialty healthcare services have a higher no-
show rate than specialty healthcare providers. Subspecialty
clinics provide care to patients referred from various
smaller peripheral facilities. Thus, the referred patients
may require traveling longer distance for a subspecialty
visit compared to their local PCP visit.
The data indicated that the day-of-week and the day-of-
month of the appointment affect no-show. Therefore, the
no-show rate of each patient for an appointment is a
function of appointment time and it is not fixed during
the year. This finding is very important as any interven-
tion aimed at reducing the no-show should include the ef-
fects of day of the week and month of the appointment.
The huge cost of no-shows combining with other un-
desirable consequences of no-show motivated the man-
agement to use any method to decrease the no-show
rate, which can decrease the overall cost of health care
tremendously. The results showed that the current
implemented reminder system had modest effect on
no-show.
Conclusions
Our findings for the effects of different factors on the
no-show rates can be used for the prediction of no-
show. Our study clearly showed that many factors
affected no-show, including age, gender, type of clinic,
time of appointment (day and month), distance, employ-
ment status, and patient health status. Therefore, any
promising methodology to predict and reduce no-show
should consider and examine the effect of these factors
on prediction model.
