ABSTRACT
Background: We assessed the relationship of body
mass index (BMI), smoking, drinking and solid fuel
use (r; SFU), and the individual and combined effects
of these factors on wheezing symptoms (WS) and on
diagnosed asthma (DA).
Methods: We analysed 175 000 individuals from 51
nationally representative surveys, using self-reports of
WS and DA as the measures of asthma. The fixed-
effects and random-effects estimates of the pooled
ORs between asthma and underweight (BMI
<18.5 kg/m2), obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2), smoking,
drinking and SFU were reported.
Results: The pooled risks of all individual risk factors
were significantly associated with WS and DA (with the
exception of current smoking with DA in women and
SFU with DA in both genders). Stronger dose–
response relationships were seen in women for
smoking amounts and duration; BMI showed stronger
quadratic relationships. The combined risks were
generally larger in women than in men, with significant
risks for underweight (OR=2.73) as well as obese
(OR=2.00) smokers for WS (OR=2.13 and OR=1.58 for
DA, respectively). The magnitude of the combined
effects from low/high BMI, smoking and drinking were
also consistently higher among women than among
men in WS and DA. SFU among underweight smokers
also had positive association with WS (men and
women) and DA (women).
Conclusions: BMI, smoking, drinking and SFU—in
combination—are associated with double or triple the
risk of development of asthma. These risk factors
might help explain the wide variation in asthma burden
across countries.
INTRODUCTION
The rising health and economic burden of
non-communicable respiratory diseases such
as asthma over the recent decades presents
a significant challenge to public health.1 As
per the 2014 Global Asthma Report estimates,
asthma is the 14th most important disorder in
terms of extent and duration of disability, and
currently affects about 334 million people.2
Asthma is a complex disease with multiple
potential risk factors of genetic, environmental
and behavioural nature, such as solid fuel use
(r; SFU), tobacco smoking, alcohol and body
mass index (BMI).3 These potential factors are
currently underexplored, but have called for
greater attention, especially given the inter-
national variations in asthma prevalence, and
increasing burden in the low-income and
middle-income countries (LMICs).1
Adverse health impacts of SFU, smoking,
drinking and BMI, as an individual risk
factor, on respiratory diseases have been
reported in various study settings, although
the impact on asthma is, in general, incon-
sistent. For example, some studies found a

 positive but unadjusted association between SFU and
asthma or wheezing,4–7 while others found no significant
effect.8–11 For BMI, most studies found an increase in
BMI as a risk factor,12–14 and others suggested that
weight loss in obese individuals may reduce asthmatic
symptoms.15
16 The impact of alcohol consumption,
independent of smoking, is also mostly conflicting, with
either a U-shaped effect of the dose of alcohol,17 or no
significant association.18 The literature also reports a
greater incidence of asthma with exposure to tobacco
smoke, but the evidence on frequency or severity of
symptoms is not provided.19–22 Additionally, the com-
bined effects
of these risk
factors have not been
adequately/sufficiently explored, when individuals are
exposed to multiple risk factors.
The concurrent impact of these risk factors may better
help explain the wide variation in asthma prevalence
across countries. These interactions can be steadily mea-
sured using individual participant data (IPD), but not very
accurately from summary measures provided in published
studies. Nationally representative studies, as used in our
paper, enable reliable country-level projections of the pro-
portion of asthma attributed to the aforementioned risk
factors. We, therefore, conducted IPD meta-analyses of
standardised national surveys in 51 countries chiefly to
investigate combined effects of tobacco smoking, alcohol
drinking, SFU and BMI on the risk of self-reported wheez-
ing symptoms (WS) and on diagnosed asthma (DA).
METHODS
Data
The WHO implemented the World Health Surveys (WHS)
between 2002 and 2004 in 70 countries,23 including 51
countries that collectively covered about 77% of estimated
global asthma cases (19 countries were excluded from our
study due to missing information on either education,
smoking, SFU or drinking). WHS household samples were
drawn from nationally representative sampling frames23
except in China, India and Russia, where the surveys were
conducted in specific regions. Adults aged 18+ years were
randomly selected from each eligible household. Our ana-
lysis focused on ages 18–44 years to reduce confusion
between asthma-related symptoms and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD).24 Between these ages, about
55% of all global asthma cases were reported.2
Two main outcomes, WS and DA, were identified if
there was a positive response to any of the following
survey questions: ‘During the past 12 months, have you
experienced any of the following: (1) attacks of wheez-
ing or whistling breathing or (2) attack of wheezing that
came on after you stopped exercising or some other
physical activity?’ to define WS; and ‘Have you (ever)
been: (1) diagnosed with asthma (an allergic respiratory
diseases) or (2) treated for it or (3) taking any medica-
tions or other treatment for it during the past 2 weeks?’
to define DA. Our reference population consisted of
those who answered at least one of the questions above,
but did not report a positive response to any of them.
Those who did not answer any of the questions above
were excluded from the analysis.
Four exposures were studied. Current smoking was
defined as daily or occasional smoking. Among current
smokers, daily consumption
was classified as 1–10,
11–20, 21+ cigarettes per day, and the duration as 1–10,
11–20 and 21+ years of daily smoking. Drinking was
defined based on a positive answer to a single question
‘Have you ever consumed a drink that contains alcohol
(such as beer, wine, etc)?’ BMI was calculated from self-
reported body weight and height. Low and high BMI
were defined as <18.5 kg/m2 for underweight (BMIuw)
and ≥30 kg/m2 for obese (BMIobs), with dose–response
analysis examining BMI scores of <18.5, 18.5–24.9,
25–29.9 and ≥30 kg/m2. SFU was defined as the house-
hold combustion of solid fuels (such as dung, charcoal,
wood or crop residues) for cooking.
Statistical analysis
We used logistic regression to relate the ORs and the
corresponding 95% CIs for WS and DA, separately.
Analyses were stratified by gender and adjusted for age,
level of education (no formal education or less than
primary vs primary education completed or more),
fruits and vegetable consumption, and, where relevant,
self-reported current smoking, alcohol use, BMI, type of
cooking fuel and WHO regions were further adjusted.
To
analyse
the
effect
sizes
when
individuals
were
exposed to multiple risk factors of asthma, combinations
of BMIuw/obs, smoking and drinking or SFU were used
in logistic regression models.
The OR for each exposure category is accompanied
by CI derived only from the SE of the log risk in that
one category. Hence, each OR, including that for the
reference group, is associated with a group-specific CI
that can be thought of as reflecting the amount of data
only in that one category.25 The 95% group-specific CI
for OR is (OR/K, OR×K), where K=exp (1.96×SE) and
SE is the SE of the log risk. If the reference group with
OR=1 and another group with OR=R have, respectively,
group-specific CIs (a, b) and (c, d), then the CI for R
that allows for the variation in both of the groups is
(√[cd/k], √[cdk]), where log (k) is given by √(log2
[d/c]+log2 [b/a]); since k>d/c, this CI is wider than
(c, d).
Statistical
heterogeneity
between
country-specific
surveys was assessed using I2 statistic. For the analysis in
which we found no significant heterogeneity (<50%),
effect estimates were given a weight equal to the inverse
variance of the country-specific survey (fixed-effects
model). For those analyses in which we noted significant
heterogeneity, we used a random-effects model to assign
the weight of each country-specific survey according to
the DerSimonian and Laird method.26 With dose–
response analysis data (smoking, BMI), the risk estimates
for each category were pooled using the inverse variance
weighted method to derive a single estimate for each

 range of dose, and trend test was performed to validate
if a trend of ORs exists. In order to assess the effect of
study quality on the reported effect estimates, we con-
ducted sensitivity analyses in which we compared pooled
effect estimates for subgroups stratified by smoking
status, SFU and no use, and country’s income status
(LMIC vs high-income country (HIC)). Sensitivity to
additional SFU-related information, such as stove type,
availability of chimney and separate kitchen, was also
tested. All analyses were conducted using R V.3.2.0 and
STATAV.12.1.
RESULTS
Of the 174 556 adults aged 18–44 years from 70 coun-
tries interviewed in the WHS, 112 711 individuals (men:
52 154; women: 60 557) from 51 countries and six WHO
regions (including 41 LMICs) met our selection criteria.
More women (27%) than men (22%) had less than
primary education (table 1). Men showed a higher inci-
dence of smoking and usage of alcohol than women.
More women than men were underweight (men: 9%;
women: 11%) or obese (men: 6%; women: 9%); both
were comparable in the incidence of WS (men: 6%;
women:
7%)
and
DA
(men:
4%;
women:
5%).
Regionally, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific
Region had the highest proportions of underweight
population (men: 23% and 11%; women: 29% and
18%);
the
Americas,
Europe
and
the
Eastern
Mediterranean region had the highest proportions of
overweight population (men: 35%, 37% and 24% ;
women: 28%, 22% and 27%); the Western Pacific
Region had high prevalence of male smokers (60%)
while African regions had highest proportions of SFUs
(men: 69%; women: 73%). The gender-specific preva-
lence of smoking, drinking, and BMIuw and BMIobs were
generally consistent with global reviews of the country-
specific data (see online supplementary table S1).
When all risk factors were treated individually, BMIuw,
BMIobs, current smoking and ever drinking showed sig-
nificant association with WS and DA for men and
women, except for smoking with DA in men (see online
supplementary table S2). When stratified by current
smoking status (see online supplementary table S3),
compared with obese non-smokers, obese smokers had
higher risk of WS and DA. On the contrary, underweight
SFUs compared with non-SFUs had an increased risk for
WS and DA (see online supplementary table S4).
Drinking had a stronger effect on the risk of WS and DA
in LMICs than in HICs, while smoking in HICs had
stronger effect on risk of WS (see online supplementary
table S5).
Significant linear trends between current smoking
status, increasing dose and duration of smoking and WS
were consistently found in all stratifications, although
such trends were not observed with DA, except for
women when stratified by gender. Significant quadratic
trends (U-shaped relationships) between BMI categories

Combined effects of low/high BMI, smoking, drinking and
SFU
Owing to sample size restrictions, we conducted two
separate combined effect analyses: a combination of
BMIuw/obs, smoking and drinking in all 51 countries; and
a combination of BMIuw/obs, smoking and SFU in 41
LMICs. In both analyses, risks in each exposure level were
calculated relative to those who did not smoke or drink,
with a BMI range of 18.5–29.9 kg/m2 (control group).
In men and women with WS, combined effects of
low/high BMI, smoking and drinking were significant
(figure 1A). In underweight and obese men, concurrent
smoking and ever drinking showed twofold higher risk
compared with the control group (BMIuw OR=2.02 (1.62
to 2.50); BMIob OR=1.99 (1.54 to 2.57)). In women with
WS, risks were twofold and threefold with both drinking
and smoking in underweight and obese women, respect-
ively (BMIuw OR=2.28 (1.58 to 3.29); BMIob OR=3.09
(1.10 to 2.90)). For DA, also, smoking, drinking and
low/high BMI in combination had higher risks in men
and women (figure 1B). In men with DA, risks were sig-
nificant for drinking and smoking (BMIuw OR=1.59
(1.18 to 2.15); BMIobs OR=1.63 (1.14 to 2.31)). Women
who concurrently drank and smoked showed signifi-
cantly higher risk of DA in underweight and obese cat-
egories (BMIuw OR=1.89 (1.18 to 3.03); BMIobs OR=2.26
(1.51 to 3.38)). In WS and DA, the magnitude of the
combined effects from low/high BMI, smoking and
drinking were consistently higher among women than
that among men.
After combining low/high BMI with smoking and SFU
statuses, significantly increased risk of WS was observed
when individuals were also exposed to smoking and SFU
(OR=2.09 (1.72 to 2.54)) among underweight men
(figure 2A). In women, the risks of WS among under-
weight smokers who did (OR=1.88 (1.36 to 2.59)) or did
not use SF (OR=2.73 (1.80 to 4.13)) were significantly
higher than in the control group. Among all smokers,
except for underweight men, SFU did not seem to add
any significant risks of WS. In women with DA, the risk
was twofold higher in non-SFU smoking underweight
women (BMIuw OR=2.13 (1.25 to 3.64; figure 2B)).
Among men, combined effects for DA were not signifi-
cant with any combinations in either BMI group.
Significant heterogeneities between four groups of dyads
were also not observed among men.
DISCUSSION
Our
pooled
analyses
showed
that
low/high
BMI,
smoking, drinking and SFU have a combined as well as
independent effect on the risk of WS and DA in men
and women. Risk estimates were in general greater for
WS than for DA; this could be due to over-reporting of
WS, which was self-reported, unlike DA, which was con-
firmed by a physician. Risks were also for the most part
greater in women than in men, for WS and DA.
Similarly, for combined effects with low/high BMI,
smoking and alcohol, women in general showed higher
risk estimates for WS and DA. Results from our com-
bined effect analyses indicated that both underweight
and obese women who also smoke and drink are about
2.3 and 3 times more likely to experience WS, and about
1.9 and 2.3 times more likely to have DA, respectively,
compared
with
women
with
a
BMI
range
of
18.5–29.9 kg/m3 who do not smoke or drink. Drinking
seemed to have a significant and stronger impact on WS
and DA in non-smokers only. Smoking, on the other
hand, significantly increased the risk of WS in drinking
and non-drinking men and in non-drinking women,
while being marginally or non-significant in drinking
women, perhaps due to a much smaller sample size of
women with both habits. The effect of smoking on DA
was mostly non-significant among drinkers and non-
drinkers, except for non-drinkers among underweight
women, thus highlighting, contrary to previous studies,
the significant impact of low BMI,15 16 and the non-
significant effect of drinking, also inconsistent with
some published findings.17
SFU showed a stronger impact on WS among non-
smokers than among smokers for obese men and
women, and for underweight women. For WS, smoking
also showed a stronger impact on WS in non-SFU obese
men and women. Most of these risks were not strong
and often insignificant for DA among men and women,
except for underweight female smokers who did not use
solid fuel. These findings were consistent with the litera-
ture reporting a stronger association with increasing
BMI, particularly in women.13 27
In a sensitivity analysis, we noticed a reduced (rather
than increased) risk of DA in men and women using
SF in less ventilated and non-separated kitchens (data
not shown). This could be due to the reverse causality
related to people taking medications for asthma, which
may be reducing the expected impact of SFU and
reduced ventilation. Under these same cooking condi-
tions, the risk of WS was significantly higher for men
(OR=1.49, 1.33 to 1.48; data not shown), further indi-
cating the harmful effect of SFU and poor ventilation.
Only a slight increase in risk was seen for women
(OR=1.14, 1.00 to 1.46), contrary to our prediction of a
higher risk since women are the primary SFUs and, in
combination with poorly ventilated conditions, should
show higher risks; a low estimate was perhaps because of
a small sample size of women. A larger sample of
women in more ventilated kitchens shows more clearly
the impact of SFU on increased risk of WS (OR=1.25,
1.14 to 1.37).
We found
a significant
positive relation
between
smoking, and both, WS and DA, in men and women.
The adjusted risks also increased with prolonged use
and dose of smoking; the impact being greater on

 women than on men. These results are consistent with
the published findings showing a higher incidence of
asthma in current and ex-smokers, with higher dose and
duration showing even greater risks.21 Finally, we also
found a significantly higher risk for WS among men and
women when exposed to SFU; ORs increase profoundly
for smokers or those with low/high BMI. We did not,
however, find a significant association between SFU and
DA; this could be due to a low sample of SFUs in the
DA group, although a few other studies have reported
similar findings.8 10 Although the risks of DA are non-
significant, the harmful impact of SFU on pulmonary
function (as in the WS and combined effects) must not
be ruled out.
Strengths and limitations
One of the strengths of this study is that it explored
both the combined and individual effects of the various
potential
risk
factors,
while
also
investigating
the
regional variations in WHO regions. The study results
are broadly representative of many countries where
prevalence of asthma remains common, and are based
on standardised methods. Results showed consistency
across countries, with little attenuated adjustment for
possible confounding variables and clear dose–response
relationships. There are, however, a few potential limita-
tions to this study.
First, the assessment of asthma-related outcomes and
risk factors was based on self-reported responses to the
WHS questions. An affirmative response to questions on
WS might indicate those with COPD, although COPD
would tend to occur at ages older than our specified
range of 18–44 years. Studies also show self-reported
asthma has a sensitivity between 60% and 65% and spe-
cificity between 65% and 70%, in comparison to peak
expiratory flow testing.28 Self-reported tobacco smoking,
drinking alcohol or height/weight measurements may
not have been accurate due to recall or reporting bias,
especially in some cultural settings, where smoking or
drinking is considered to be socially prohibitive or stig-
matising. However, this would tend to make our esti-
mates more conservative. For example, the prevalence of
smoking among those self-reporting WS/DA in our
study was lower than that reported in other studies.29 30
This might reflect under-reporting of smoking by those
with WS/DA.
Second, information on exposure to ambient air pol-
lution and secondhand smoking (SHS), which are both
known to be associated with increased risk/exacerbation
of asthma, was not available in WHS.1 31 Large propor-
tions of the populations in Asia and North and West
Africa are exposed to high concentrations of ambient
fine
particulate
matter.32
SHS
may
be
particularly
important for populations where the male smoking rate
is very high while the female smoking rate is very low,
such as those of Bangladesh and India. Again, this will
result in underestimation of the true effect of smoking
on asthma.
Implications
Given a limited number of studies on the simultaneous
effect of various risk factors, our analysis covering these
factors and their combined effects has important impli-
cations for asthma morbidity. The concurrent impact of
these factors on WS and DA calls for greater emphasis
on collaborative—rather than isolated—efforts, to reduce
their exposure. Equally important is the impact on the
working age population specifically, which points to
another potential area of focus for future intervention
strategies.
