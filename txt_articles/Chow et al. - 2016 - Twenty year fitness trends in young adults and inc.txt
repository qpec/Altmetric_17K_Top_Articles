Abstract
Aims/hypothesis The prospective association between cardio-
respiratory fitness (CRF) measured in young adulthood and
middle age on development of prediabetes, defined as impaired
fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance, or diabetes
by middle age remains unknown. We hypothesised that higher
fitness levels would be associated with reduced risk for devel-
oping incident prediabetes/diabetes by middle age.
Methods Participants were from the Coronary Artery Risk
Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study who were free
from prediabetes/diabetes at baseline (year 0 [Y0]: 1985–1986).
CRF was quantified by treadmill duration (converted to meta-
bolic equivalents [METs]) at Y0, Y7 and Y20 and prediabetes/
diabetes status was assessed at Y0, Y7, Y10, Y15, Y20 and Y25.
We use an extended Cox model with CRF as the primary time-
varying exposure. BMI was included as a time-varying covari-
ate. The outcome was development of either prediabetes or dia-
betes after Y0. Model 1 included age, race, sex, field centre, CRF
and BMI. Model 2 additionally included baseline (Y0) smoking,
energy intake, alcohol intake, education, systolic BP, BP medi-
cation use and lipid profile.
Results Higher fitness was associated with lower risk for de-
veloping incident prediabetes/diabetes (difference of 1 MET:
HR 0.99898 [95% CI 0.99861, 0.99940], p <0.01), which
persisted (difference of 1 MET: HR 0.99872 [95% CI
0.99840, 0.99904], p<0.01] when adjusting for covariates.
Conclusions/interpretation Examining participants who had
fitness measured from young adulthood to middle age, we
found that fitness was associated with lower risk for developing
prediabetes/diabetes, even when adjusting for BMI over this
time period. These findings emphasise the importance of fitness
in reducing the health burden of prediabetes and diabetes.

Introduction
Americans are becoming increasingly obese and sedentary
[1], which parallels the increasing epidemic of diabetes [2].
As physical activity is inversely associated with incident dia-
betes [3], the metabolic syndrome [4] and mortality [5], there
is mounting interest in reducing morbidity and mortality by
increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary time [6].
Although not equivalent due to genetics and behaviour effects,
physical activity is directly related to cardiorespiratory fitness
(CRF) [7]. Several prospective studies have observed higher
CRF to be associated with lower future risk of coronary heart
disease [8], the metabolic syndrome [9], diabetes [10] and
total mortality [8].
Yet the benefits of higher CRF in young adulthood are not
necessarily maintained across the lifespan. Compared with
decreases in CRF over time, longitudinal improvement in
CRF or maintenance of CRF through adulthood are associated
with lower risk of hypertension [11], the metabolic syndrome
[9], hyperlipidaemia [11], diabetes [10], cardiovascular mor-
tality [12] and total mortality [13]. This literature, however,
remains limited for several reasons. Much [12, 13], but not all
[10, 11], of the current literature on CRF change has been
focused on men, with either varying duration between CRF
assessments [11, 12], or a limited period (5–7 years) between
CRF assessments [10, 13]. Although it is generally presumed
that higher fitness is associated with lower rates of prediabe-
tes, defined as impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glu-
cose tolerance, or diabetes prospectively, we present a unique
opportunity to address this presumption using the Coronary
Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study
(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00005130). The CARDIA study ob-
jectively documented fitness by using treadmill exercise test-
ing to measure CRF at baseline (year 0 [Y0]: age 18–30 years),
in early adulthood (Y7: age 25–37 years) and again at middle
age (Y20: age 38–50 years), with documentation of incident
prediabetes/diabetes over 25 years. This project extends a pre-
vious CARDIA analysis that reported that higher CRF in
young adulthood and less CRF decline (over 7 years) reduce
the 20 year risk for developing incident diabetes [10]. We
hypothesised higher fitness levels, even after adjusting for
changes in BMI, would be associated with reduced risk for
developing incident prediabetes/diabetes.
Methods
Participants The CARDIA study is a prospective, multicentre,
cohort study designed to investigate trends and determinants of
coronary heart disease risk factors in young adults. Black and
white women and men (ages 18–30 years at Y0) were recruited
and examined in 1985–1986 from four US communities
(Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN and
Oakland, CA) and balanced on age, race, sex and educational
attainment as previously described [14]. A total of 5,115 par-
ticipants were enrolled at baseline (Y0) with follow-up exam-
inations at 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 and 25 years after baseline, with
retention of 91%, 86%, 81%, 79%, 74%, 72% and 72% of the
surviving cohort, respectively. All participants provided written
informed consent. The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Boards from each participating institution.
For this particular study, we excluded participants that did
not have baseline treadmill results (n=69 excluded) or diabe-
tes assessment at baseline (additional n=80 excluded). We
also excluded the CARDIA participants who had a diagnosis
of prediabetes at Y0 (additional n=105 excluded) or diabetes
(additional n = 28 excluded) or did not have at least one
follow-up visit documenting prediabetes/diabetes status (ad-
ditional n = 460 excluded). After application of exclusion
criteria, 4,373 CARDIA participants were available for
analysis. Participants who did not develop prediabetes/
diabetes by the time of their last available examination visit
were censored.
CRF A symptom-limited graded treadmill exercise testing
using a modified Balke protocol [15] was used to assess
CRF in the CARDIA study. The test protocol was designed
to assess maximal, symptom-limited performance. After base-
line measurement of pulse, BP and ECG, the participant
started the protocol. The protocol consisted of nine stages
(2 min/stage, maximum 18 min/test) of progressively increas-
ing difficulty, with the first six stages generally performed by
walking. Stage 1 was 4.8 km/h at 2% grade (4.1 metabolic
equivalents [METs]), progressing to stage 9 at 9.0 km/h at
25% grade (19.0 METs). The exercise test was terminated
either due to fatigue (82.5%), shortness of breath (7.5%), ab-
normal ECG response (1%), medical reasons (5.3%), partici-
pant refusal (1.6%) or completion of the entire protocol
(0.2%) [15]. As previously described, treadmill duration as
assessed by the Balke protocol has been shown to be highly
predictive (r=−0.94) of maximum oxygen uptake (V
:O2max)
[16]. Treadmill duration was converted to equivalent METs
using a previously published conversion formula [15].
In the CARDIA cohort, the treadmill test was performed at
Y0, Y7 and Y20. Because of an identified systemic protocol
violation at Y7 at one site [17], the treadmill results from Y0,
Y7 and Y20 were used when appropriate (three sites). In the
extended Cox model, fitness prior to Y7 was represented by
Y0 CRF (all sites), fitness between Y7 and Y20 was repre-
sented by Y7 CRF (for the three valid sites: n=2,415, other-
wise Y0 CRF was used for the remaining site: n=1,195) and
1660

 fitness between Y20 and Y25 was represented by Y20 CRF
(all sites).
Ascertainment of prediabetes and diabetes At Y0, Y7, Y10,
Y15, Y20 and Y25, prediabetes and diabetes status were
assessed. The outcome was development of either prediabetes
or diabetes (described as prediabetes/diabetes) after Y0. Once a
participant developed either documented prediabetes or diabetes
after Y0, they were considered to have an event and were sub-
sequently censored. The outcome for the extended Cox model
was time to development of incident prediabetes/diabetes. This
was calculated as the time to the CARDIA follow-up visit where
the diagnosis was made. Participants were classified as having
prediabetes if they met any of the following criteria: fasting
glucose 5.6–6.9 mmol/l; 2 h OGTT glucose 7.8–11.1 mmol/l
or HbA1c 5.7–6.4% (39–46 mmol/mol IFCC). Participants were
classified as having diabetes if any of the following criteria
was met: fasting glucose ≥7 mmol/l; use of medications for
diabetes treatment; 2 h GTT ≥11.1 mmol/l or HbA1c ≥6.5%
(48 mmol/mol IFCC) [10]. Serum glucose concentrations
were measured using the hexokinase method.
Covariates Covariates were selected in our analysis due to
their clinical relevance and association with diabetes and/or
CRF. Relevant covariates measured at Y0 included age, sex,
race, field centre, BMI, smoking (current/former/never), ener-
gy intake (kJ/day), alcohol intake (ml/day) and education level
(highest year of school completed). To quantify physical ac-
tivity (reported as exercise units [EU]), the CARDIA physical
activity history questionnaire was used, which was an
interviewer-based self-report of duration and intensity of par-
ticipation in 13 categories of exercise over the previous
12 months [18]. As a reference, 300 EU approximates to
150 min of moderate-intensity activity (3–5 METs, with 1
MET defined as energy expenditure at rest or 3.5 ml O2/kg)
per week or 30 min of moderate-intensity activity 5 days per
week [19]. These covariates were measured by trained and
certified staff, using standardised protocols across field centres
and examinations with quality control monitoring [14, 20].
Age, race and sex were confirmed during the clinic visits.
Diet was measured using an interviewer-administrated, vali-
dated, semi-quantitative, food frequency questionnaire [21].
Body weight was measured with light clothing to the
nearest 0.09 kg, body height without shoes was measured to
the nearest 0.5 cm and BMI was calculated from these mea-
sures in units of kg/m2 [20]. Because time-varying BMI was
included in the analysis, we used Y0 BMI as a predictor for
outcomes between Y0 and Y7, Y7 BMI as a predictor for
outcomes between Y7 and Y10, Y10 BMI for outcomes be-
tween Y10 and Y15, Y15 BMI for outcomes between Y15
and Y20 and Y20 BMI for outcomes between Y20 and Y25.
We also used several cardiometabolic risk factors (systolic
BP [SBP], medication treatment of hypertension, HDL-
cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol) in the analysis.
Cardiometabolic risk factors were measured using
standardised protocols across field centres and examinations
with quality control monitoring [14, 20]. BP was measured
three times after a 5 min rest, using a Hawksley random zero
sphygmomanometer (WA Baum Company, Copaigue, NY,
USA) on the right arm of the seated participant. The average
of the last two measures of three was used for Y0 SBP [20].
Fasting plasma blood samples were sent to the Northwest
Lipid Research Laboratories, University of Washington
(Seattle, WA, USA) for lipid determination. Total cholesterol
and triacylglycerol (TG) were measured enzymatically [22].
HDL-cholesterol was determined after dextran sulfate–mag-
nesium chloride precipitation [23] and LDL-cholesterol was
calculated using the Friedewald equation [24].
Statistical analysis In Table 1, participant Y0 characteristics
are presented by whether they developed incident prediabetes/
diabetes by Y25, using means and SD for continuous vari-
ables and percentages for categorical variables. Two-sample
t tests and χ2 tests were performed for continuous variables
and categorical variables, respectively, to compare the two
groups.
Modelling was performed using an extended Cox regres-
sion analysis, with inclusion of fitness and BMI as time-
varying covariates. The outcome was incidence of prediabetes
or diabetes as documented at Y7, Y10, Y15, Y20 or Y25.
Model 1 included age, race, sex, field centre, time-dependent
CRF and time-dependent BMI. Model 2 additionally included
Y0 lifestyle factors (smoking, energy intake, alcohol intake,
education, SBP, medication for hypertension, LDL-
cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol). For both Model 1 and
Model 2, we examined whether there was significant interac-
tion between race and sex. As interaction between race and
sex was not significant, this was therefore not included in
Model 1 and Model 2. The extended Cox regression model-
ling approach eliminates the need to test for proportional haz-
ards because the models are not restricted to baseline values of
the exposures of interest. All analyses were performed using
Statistical Analysis Software (version 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary,
NC, USA).
Results
Subject characteristics Compared with CARDIA partici-
pants who did not develop prediabetes or diabetes by Y25
(Table 1), the participants who developed prediabetes or dia-
betes by Y25 tended to be older, black race and male sex, were
more likely to take blood pressure medication, more likely to
smoke, have higher weight, BMI, waist circumference, SBP,
LDL, daily alcohol intake and daily energy intake, and show a
decline in treadmill duration over 20 years. Compared with

 CARDIA participants who did not develop prediabetes or dia-
betes by Y25, the participants who developed prediabetes or
diabetes by Y25 group had lower Y0 CRF (as quantified by
Y0 treadmill duration and converted to Y0 treadmill energy ex-
penditure in METs), lower HDL-cholesterol, lower Y7 CRF (as
quantified by Y7 treadmill duration and converted to Y7 tread-
mill energy expenditure in METs), lower Y20 CRF (as quantified
by Y20 treadmill duration and converted to Y20 treadmill energy
expenditure in METs) and a lower proportion who increased their
CRF over 20 years. There was no difference in educational level
or physical activity level between the two groups.
Self-reported physical activity obtained by questionnaire was
related to objectively measured CRF: Y0 physical activity cor-
related with Y0 CRF (METs) (r=0.39, p<0.01, all sites used).
Y0 CRF (METs) correlated with Y7 CRF (METs) (r=0.76,
p<0.01, 3 sites used) and Y0 CRF (METs) correlated with
Y20 CRF (METs) (r=0.69, p<0.01, all sites used).
Association of CRF with development of prediabetes/
diabetes by Y25 In this study (N = 4,373), 1,927 (44.1%)
participants did not develop either prediabetes or diabetes by
Y25. By Y25, 1,941 (44.5%) participants developed predia-
betes and 505 (11.5%) participants developed diabetes.
We examined associations between CRF (METs) with the
development of prediabetes or diabetes by Y25 (Table 2).
While taking the time-varying aspect of BMI into account, we
observed that higher CRF (per 1 METincrement) was associated
with lower risk for developing incident prediabetes/diabetes

Discussion
As the benefit of high levels of fitness in young adulthood is
well documented in current literature, this study evaluated the
association between prospectively measured CRF over
20 years on incident prediabetes or diabetes by middle age.
We found that CRF was associated with lower risk for devel-
oping prediabetes/diabetes, even when adjusting for BMI over
this time period. These findings emphasise the importance of
continued lifelong fitness in reducing the risk for developing
prediabetes/diabetes.
Given high baseline levels of fitness, the prospective health
benefits are well established [8, 13], with CRF mitigating the
risk for developing impaired fasting glucose and type 2 dia-
betes even in obese participants [25]. The natural extension of
this literature is to evaluate the metabolic impact of fitness,
objectively quantified prospectively. By leveraging the unique
design of CARDIA, this study complements and extends the
current literature [10–13] by examining the association of
changes in fitness over 20 years, from young adulthood to
middle age, on developing prediabetes/diabetes, while consid-
ering concurrent changes in BMI.
There are several mechanisms by which continued fitness
may reduce the risk for prediabetes and diabetes. Twenty weeks
of supervised exercise training has been shown to improve the
components of the metabolic syndrome, such as reduced TG,
fasting glucose, waist circumference and improved HDL-
cholesterol levels[4]. One mechanism may arise from the effect
of exercise on visceral fat. Compared with subcutaneous fat,
accumulation of visceral fat is associated with more adverse
metabolic risk factors [26] and higher risk of diabetes [27].
With ageing, muscle mass declines[28, 29] and visceral fat in-
creases [30, 31]. Since exercise training, depending on type,
duration and intensity, reduces visceral fat and increases muscle
mass [32, 33], this may be a significant protective mechanism. In
addition, type 2 diabetes is associated with low-grade systemic
inflammation [34]. Potentially, another mechanism may arise
from the anti-inflammatory effect of exercise [35, 36]. Short-
term (20 weeks) supervised exercise training has been shown
to reduce C-reactive protein (median 1.34 mg/l reduction) in
participants with the highest level of C-reactive protein
(>3.0 mg/l) prior to training [37]. In the absence of weight
change, smaller clinical studies have shown that exercise training
improves fitness, as measured by V
:O2max, and insulin sensitivity,
as measured by the gold standard hyperinsulinaemic–
euglycaemic clamp [38, 39]. Our findings support the long-
term implications of these short-term mechanistic findings.
This study is clinically relevant as it provides evidence to
support the commonly accepted dogma that fitness is benefi-
cial in reducing the risk for prediabetes/diabetes. As this ben-
efit remained significant even when adjusting for BMI, exer-
cise programmes remain critically important for reducing the
adverse health impact of prediabetes, diabetes, and their asso-
ciated complications. From a clinical standpoint, the amount
of physical activity required to increase an individual’s fitness
by 1 MET (3.5 ml O2 kg−1 min−1) depends on multiple factors,
which include the age, health and baseline activity of the in-
dividual as well as the duration, intensity and form of the
exercise. As a reference, the STRRIDE-AT/RT (Studies
Targeting Risk Reduction Interventions through Defined
Exercise-Aerobic Training and/or Resistance Training) study
found that sedentary obese/overweight men and women
(mean age 51 years, baseline V
:O2max 27.1 ml O2 kg−1
min−1) increased V
:O2max by 3.9 ml O2 kg−1 min−1 with
8 months of aerobic training (0.06 mJ (14 kcal)/kg per week)
and by 4.1 ml O2 kg−1 min−1 with 8 months of combined
aerobic and resistance training (0.06 mJ (14 kcal)/kg per
week+180 min resistance training per week) [40]. The high
rate of incident prediabetes in the CARDIA cohort addition-
ally highlights the preventative aspect of fitness in reducing
prediabetes, which predicts and precedes the development of
diabetes.
This study has several strengths. It focuses on an important
demographic—young adults (age 18–30 years) followed pro-
spectively through to middle age (age 43–55 years). It also

 capitalises on several key features of CARDIA, specifically the
prospective objective measurement of CRF by treadmill testing,
balanced cohort in terms of sex, race and educational attainment,
outcome measurements using standardised protocols with rigor-
ous quality control and frequent in-person follow-up visits to
ascertain incident prediabetes/diabetes. Consequently, the ability
to quantify time to event, on the scale of the CARDIA study, is a
study strength. Because of its objective measures of CRF over
several time points and standardised long-term follow-up,
CARDIA is a unique resource with which to address the relative
association of prospective measures of fitness with prospective
development of incident prediabetes/diabetes.
This study also has several limitations. CRF is not equiva-
lent to physical activity and has a significant genetic compo-
nent [41]. However, physical activity has been shown to have a
dose–response relationship to cardiovascular CRF, with phys-
ical activity positively correlated with CRF [7]. We also saw a
modest correlation between baseline physical activity and fit-
ness in our data. In CARDIA, CRF was measured by treadmill
duration and did not account for weight, with the possibility
that reduced treadmill duration is not necessarily due to re-
duced CRF but rather weight gain. We adjusted for this possi-
bility by including time-varying BMI in our modelling. We
also acknowledge that participants, particularly in the group
that developed prediabetes/diabetes by Y25, may terminate
the treadmill test due to reasons other than reaching their full
physical capability. Although this may reduce the quantifica-
tion of CRF by treadmill duration, early test termination, even
if participants are physically capable, still remains an adverse
prognostic indicator. We also acknowledge the presence of the
‘healthy cohort’ phenomenon, such that participants who can
be followed up are generally healthier than those lost to follow-
up. This limitation would tend to underestimate the observed
associations by excluding those more likely to develop
prediabetes/diabetes and less likely to maintain fitness levels.
In summary, by examining participants who had fitness
measured from young adulthood to middle age, we found that
fitness was associated with lower risk for developing predia-
betes/diabetes, even when adjusting for BMI over this time
period. These findings emphasise the importance of fitness in
reducing the health burden of prediabetes/diabetes.
