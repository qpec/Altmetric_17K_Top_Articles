BACKGROUND: Secondhand smoke (SHS) causes disease and death among nonsmokers. 
Private settings are major sources of exposure for children. We assessed prevalence and 
determinants of self-reported SHS exposure in homes and vehicles, as well as school, work, 
and indoor/outdoor public areas, among US students in grades 6 through 12.
METHODS: Data were from the 2013 National Youth Tobacco Survey (n = 18 406). Self-reported 
SHS exposure within the past 7 days was assessed overall and by extent of smoke-free home 
and vehicle rules among never users of 10 tobacco product types. Descriptive statistics 
were used to compare estimates, and adjusted prevalence ratios were calculated to assess 
determinants of SHS exposure.
RESULTS: Among never tobacco users, 48.0% reported SHS exposure in 1 or more locations, 
including 15.5% in the home, 14.7% in a vehicle, 16.8% at school, 27.1% at work, and 35.2% 
in an indoor/outdoor public area. Home exposure was 8.5%, 55.3%, and 79.4% among never 
tobacco users with complete, partial, or no smoke-free home rules, respectively (P < .05). 
Vehicle exposure was 7.1%, 44.8%, and 70.2% among never tobacco users with complete, 
partial, or no smoke-free vehicle rules, respectively (P < .05). Factors associated with higher 
prevalence ratio of SHS exposure included current tobacco use, truant behavior, and having 
tobacco using household members/friends
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of US students in grades 6 through 12 reported exposure to 
SHS in 2013. Smoke-free home and vehicle rules, coupled with intensified implementation 
and enforcement of comprehensive smoke-free laws, could help protect youth from this 
preventable health hazard.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Secondhand 
smoke exposure causes disease and death in 
nonsmokers. Despite progress in implementing 
comprehensive smoke-free laws prohibiting smoking 
in public settings, millions of US adults and children 
remain exposed to secondhand smoke in private 
settings.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Among US students who 
never used tobacco, 48.0% reported secondhand 
smoke exposure. Home or vehicle exposure was 
more than ninefold higher among never tobacco 
users with no home or vehicle smoke-free rules than 
those with 100% smoke-free rules.

Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure 
causes several adverse health 
conditions in children, including 
middle ear disease, respiratory 
symptoms, impaired lung function, 
lower respiratory illness, and 
sudden infant death syndrome.1,2 
Over the past decade, major strides 
have been made within the United 
States in protecting nonsmokers 
from involuntary SHS exposure. 
As of January 2015, 26 US states 
and the District of Columbia had 
implemented comprehensive smoke-
free laws prohibiting smoking in all 
indoor public places and worksites, 
including restaurants and bars.3 
Additionally, ∼700 local communities 
have implemented such laws; ∼50% 
of the US population is currently 
covered by a state and/or local 
comprehensive smoke-free law.4 
These laws have benefitted public 
health as indicated by corresponding 
declines in SHS exposure in children 
and adults and by the increased 
adoption of voluntary smoke-
free home and car rules in US 
households.5–7 Of US households 
nationally, the proportion with 
smoke-free home rules almost 
doubled between 1992–1993 (43%) 
and 2010–2011 (83%), and 73.6% 
reported having a smoke-free vehicle 
rule during 2009–2010.6,7
Despite these noted advances, 
several states have no statewide 
law addressing SHS in public areas, 
and others have enacted laws with 
less stringent smoking restrictions.4 
Moreover, private settings largely not 
covered by these laws, such as homes 
and vehicles, remain major sources 
of SHS exposure among children.1 
Approximately 29% of US parents 
who live with their children are 
current cigarette smokers, and 44% 
of US adult smokers report smoking 
in a car when nonsmokers are 
present8,9; accordingly, children with 
smoking parents may be exposed to 
high levels of SHS in these settings 
over prolonged periods. Students 
may also be susceptible to SHS 
exposure on school grounds because 
only 67.5% of US public school 
districts had complete tobacco-free 
environments during 2012.10
Earlier studies have examined SHS 
exposure in select environments, 
such as vehicles and at school, 
among national samples of US 
middle and high school students.11–13 
However, limited recent data 
exist on SHS exposure among 
nonsmoking US middle and high 
school students across a diverse 
range of environments. It is a public 
health priority to protect children 
from SHS exposure in all settings, 
especially given that children who 
have never smoked tobacco products 
may still be exposed to SHS in a 
variety of both private and public 
settings. This study assessed the 
prevalence and determinants of self-
reported SHS exposure at home, in 
a vehicle, at school, at work, and in 
indoor/outdoor public areas among 
a nationally representative sample of 
US students in grades 6 through 12 
during 2013.
METHODS
Data Source/Sample
Data were from the 2013 National 
Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS), an 
ongoing school-based survey that 
collects information on key tobacco-
related measures from middle school 
(grades 6–8) and high school (grades 
9–12) students.14 Students completed 
a self-administered, pencil and paper 
questionnaire in a classroom setting.
The NYTS uses a 3-stage cluster 
sampling procedure to generate 
cross-sectional, nationally 
representative samples of US middle 
and high school students. The 
sampling frame consists of all public 
and private school students enrolled 
in grades 6 through 12 in the 50 
states and the District of Columbia.
Sampling procedures for NYTS are 
probabilistic and conducted without 
replacement at 3 stages: (1) primary 
sampling unit, such as a county, 
group of small counties, or portion 
of a large county; (2) schools within 
each selected primary sampling unit; 
and (3) classes within each selected 
school. During 2013, 18 406 students 
completed the questionnaire, yielding 
an overall response rate of 67.8%.14
Measures
Tobacco Use
Never tobacco users were students 
who reported never using any of 
the following tobacco products in 
their lifetime: cigarettes/flavored 
cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, 
cigars/flavored cigars, pipes, 
bidis, kreteks, hookahs, electronic 
cigarettes (e-cigarettes), smokeless 
tobacco (dissolvable tobacco, 
chewing tobacco/snuff/dip, or snus), 
or “some other new tobacco products 
not listed.” Former tobacco users 
were students who had ever used 
any tobacco products during their 
lifetime but did not use any tobacco 
products within the past 30 days. 
Current tobacco users were students 
who had used any tobacco products 
on at least one day during the past 
30 days. Exclusive current use was 
assessed for certaintobacco products 
(cigarettes, smokeless tobacco 
products, and electronic cigarettes), 
and was defined as use of the 
specified product within the past 30 
days, but no other tobacco product.
Self-Reported Exposure to Secondhand 
Smoke
Self-reported exposure to SHS at 
home and in a vehicle were assessed 
with the following respective 
questions: “During the past 7 days, 
on how many days did someone 
smoke tobacco products in your 
home while you were there?” “During 
the past 7 days, on how many days 
did you ride in a vehicle where 
someone was smoking a tobacco 
product?” Self-reported exposure in 
the other environments was assessed 
with separate questions with the 
following common stem: “During

the past 7 days, on how many 
days did you breathe the smoke 
from someone who was smoking a 
tobacco product?” The environments 
assessed were “at school, including 
school buildings, school grounds, and 
school parking lots?”; “in the place 
where you work?” and “in an indoor 
or outdoor public place?”
Among all respondents, students 
were classified as being exposed to 
SHS in the specified environment if 
they reported exposure on at least 
1 day within the past 7 days. Any 
SHS exposure was defined as self-
reported exposure on at least 1 day 
within the past 7 days, in at least 
1 of the 5 environments assessed. 
Among those exposed, we further 
classified the frequency of exposure 
as daily (all 7 days) or nondaily (1–6 
days). For the question assessing 
SHS exposure at work, students who 
indicated “I do not have a job” or “I 
did not work during the past 7 days 
were excluded from analyses for this 
indicator.
Smoke-Free Rule Presence and 
Compliance
Smoke-free home rules were 
assessed with the question, “Inside 
your home (not counting decks, 
garages, or porches) is smoking (1) 
Always allowed” [no smoke-free 
rules]; (2) Allowed only at some 
times or in some places” [partial 
smoke-free rules], or (3) “Never 
allowed” [complete smoke-free 
rules]. Smoke-free vehicle rules 
were assessed with the question 
“In the vehicles that you and family 
members who live with you own or 
lease, is smoking . . .” with the same 
response options and definitions. 
Compliance with smoke-free school 
policies was assessed with the 
following 2 questions: “During the 
past 30 days, to your knowledge, 
has anyone, including yourself, 
smoked a tobacco product on school 
property when he or she was not 
supposed to?”; and “During the past 
30 days, to your knowledge, has 
anyone, including yourself, used 
some other type of tobacco product 
(that is, one that is not smoked) on 
school property when he or she was 
not supposed to?” A response of 
“Yes” to either question was taken 
as an indication of partial or no 
compliance with smoke-free school 
policies, while a response of “No” to 
both questions indicated complete 
compliance with smoke-free school 
policies.
Covariates
Sociodemographic characteristics 
included gender (boy or girl); race/
ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, non-Hispanic other, 
or Hispanic); school level (middle 
[grades 6–8] or high [grades 9–12]); 
tobacco use by household members 
(yes or no); tobacco use by close 
friends (yes or no); and past-year 
truant behavior (a report of having 
“skipped” or “cut” class for ≥1 class 
period within the past 12 months; 
yes or no).
Analysis
Prevalence of self-reported SHS 
exposure was calculated overall 
and stratified by sociodemographic 
characteristics, tobacco use status, 
and extent of smoke-free rule 
enforcement or compliance at home, 
in the family vehicle, and at school. 
Statistical comparison of estimates 
was performed using the χ2 test 
(P < .05). Multivariate Poisson 
regression was used to calculate 
adjusted prevalence ratios for self-
reported SHS exposure in each 
individual environment, as well as 
overall, assessing for age, gender, 
school level, race/ethnicity, truant 
behavior, current use of any tobacco 
product, tobacco use by household 
members, tobacco use by close 
friends, and extent of smoke-free rule 
enforcement or compliance at home, 
in the family vehicle, and at school. 
All data were weighted to yield 
nationally representative estimates, 
and data were analyzed with Stata 
V.13.
RESULTS
Self-Reported SHS Exposure by 
Location
Among all students, 55.9% reported 
exposure to SHS in at least 1 setting. 
When considering reported exposure 
by setting, 23.9% reported exposure 
at home, 25.0% in a vehicle, 24.9% at 
school, 39.7% at work, and 39.9% in 
an indoor/outdoor public area (Table 
1).
Self-Reported SHS Exposure by 
Tobacco Use
Any SHS exposure reporting differed 
significantly by tobacco use status 
(Table 1). Self-reported exposure was 
48.0% among never tobacco users, 
64.8% among former tobacco users, 
and 79.9% among current tobacco 
users (P < .05). Among never tobacco 
users, 15.5% reported exposure to 
SHS in the home, 14.7% in a vehicle, 
16.8% at school, 27.1% at work, and 
35.2% in an indoor/outdoor public 
area. Among never tobacco users who 
reported any SHS exposure, 23.3% 
reported daily exposure in at least 
1 setting. The source of exposure 
(not mutually exclusive) among 
never tobacco users reporting daily 
exposure was 52% at home, 22.1% 
in a vehicle, 14.9% at school, 15.6% 
at work, and 9.5% in an indoor/
outdoor public area (Supplemental 
Table 4). Exclusive current smokeless 
tobacco users reported significantly 
lower prevalence of SHS exposure 
than exclusive cigarette smokers 
in the home (40.5% vs 53.1% 
respectively) and in a vehicle 
(47.1% vs 60.0% respectively), but 
no significant difference existed in 
other environments. No significant 
differences in SHS exposure were 
observed between exclusive users of 
cigarettes and e-cigarettes within all 
assessed environments.
Among all study participants, most 
reported having complete smoke-
free rules in their homes (80.6%), 
family vehicles (76.1%), and schools 
(68.6%) (Table 2). Among never

tobacco users, prevalence of self-
reported SHS exposure in the home 
was 8.5%, 55.3%, and 79.4% among 
those with complete, partial, or no 
smoke-free home rules, respectively 
(P < .05). Similarly, prevalence of 
self-reported SHS exposure in a 
vehicle was 7.1%, 44.8%, and 70.2% 
among never tobacco users with 
complete, partial, or no smoke-free 
vehicle rules, respectively (P < .05). 
Prevalence of self-reported SHS 
exposure in school was 11.8% among 
never tobacco users who reported 
completely enforced smoke-free 
school policies and 32.9% among 
those not reporting completely 
enforced smoke-free school policies 
(P < .05).
Determinants of Self-Reported SHS
After multivariate adjustment, 
adolescent boys had lower likelihood 
than adolescent girls of reporting 
exposure to any SHS overall 
(adjusted prevalence ratio [APR] 
= 0.86; 95% confidence interval 
[CI] = 0.83–0.90), as well as within 
most environments assessed; the 
only exception was at work and 
home, where no significant gender 
difference existed in self-reported 
exposure (Table 3). Students in high 
school had higher likelihood than 
middle school students of reporting 
exposure to SHS in school (APR = 
1.30; 95% CI = 1.10–1.53) but did not 
differ significantly in reporting SHS 
exposure from other environments. 
The likelihood of reporting SHS 
exposure in vehicles were lower 
among Hispanics (APR = 0.57; 95% 
CI = 0.44–0.74) and non-Hispanics 
of other races (APR = 0.76; 95% CI = 
0.62–0.93) when compared with non-
Hispanic whites. Non-Hispanic blacks 
had higher likelihood of reporting 
exposure to SHS in school and at 
work compared with non-Hispanic 
whites (APR = 1.14, and 1.19, 
respectively; P < .05).
Other factors associated with 
higher likelihood of self-reported 
SHS exposure overall and in each 
of the 5 environments assessed 
included current any tobacco use, 
truant behavior, having a household 
member who used tobacco and 
having a close friend who used 
tobacco. Presence of complete 
smoke-free rule at home was 
associated with lower likelihood of 
reporting SHS exposure in any setting 
(APR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.90-0.98); at 
home (APR = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.53–
0.62); in school (APR = 0.88; 95% 
CI = 0.79-0.99); and at work (APR = 
0.84; 95% CI = 0.72–0.98), compared 
with no smoke-free rule at home. In 
contrast, partial smoke-free rule at 
home was associated with higher 
likelihood of reporting SHS exposure 
in any setting and in a vehicle (APR 
= 1.06; 95% CI = 1.02–1.11; and 
APR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.02–1.21, 
respectively). Compared with no 
smoke-free rule, complete smoke-
free rule in vehicles was associated 
with lower exposure to SHS in all 
settings. Compliance with complete 
smoke-free rule at school was 
associated with lower prevalence 
ratios for all settings, except at home, 
compared with a partial compliance 
with smoke-free rules.
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrated that 
nearly half (48.0%) of US middle 
and high school students who have 
never used tobacco were exposed 
to SHS in 2013. Self-reported SHS 
exposure in the home or in a vehicle 
was more than ninefold higher 
among never tobacco users with no 
smoke-free home or car rules than 
those with 100% smoke-free rules. 
Furthermore, homes and vehicles 
were the settings where the highest 
percentage of never tobacco users 
reported daily SHS exposure. These 
findings underscore the importance 
of enhanced implementation of 
smoke-free home and vehicle rules 
in conjunction with continued efforts 
to implement comprehensive smoke-
free laws in public places. Strongly 
enforced smoke-free policies can 
protect nonsmokers from SHS, help 
denormalize tobacco use, and and 
can support youth tobacco-use 
prevention and cessation efforts.
Although tremendous progress has 
been made in the past decade in the 
United States in protecting youths 
from SHS in public areas, this study 
showed that public areas remain the 
most frequent source of exposure 
to SHS among US middle and high 
school students. Public places, such 
as sport venues, restaurants, or 
airports, which provide exemptions 
to smoke free laws (eg, designated 
smoking areas), could be potential 
sources of SHS for children because 
of drifting of SHS. Parents could make 
efforts to deliberately reduce their 
children’s exposure to SHS in public 
places in several way, including not 
allowing people to smoke around 
them, moving away or deciding 
against staying in places where 
smoking is occurring, and educating 
their children on the dangers of 
SHS exposure and the need to avoid 
environments where smoking may be 
likely to occur
Despite having a significantly lower 
cigarette smoking prevalence,15 
adolescent girls were more likely 
than adolescent boys to report any 
SHS exposure, a finding that has been 
observed in several other studies.11,12 
Indeed, research shows that female 
youths are more likely than their 
male counterparts to perceive 
SHS as being harmful16 and hence 
may be more likely to remember 
an encounter of SHS exposure. 
Other inequalities in SHS exposure 
noted in our study, such as the 
disproportionately higher prevalence 
among high school, non-Hispanic 
white, and truant students, might 
be attributable to higher prevalence 
of cigarette smoking among these 
subgroups.15 Additionally, SHS 
exposure among former tobacco 
users (64.8%) was lower than 
current tobacco users (79.9%) but 
higher than never tobacco users

(48.0%). This finding might be due to 
former tobacco users’ socialization 
with smoking peers or exposure to 
environments where smoking might 
be occurring, which could serve as 
social, behavioral, or environmental 
cues that trigger smoking relapse, 
especially in places with no 
prohibitions on sales of emerging 
tobacco products to minors, or use 
of such tobacco products in public 
places17.18,19
Current tobacco use by a household 
member was associated with 
higher likelihood of reporting SHS 
exposure in the home, family car, 
and other environments. Health care 
professionals can play a vital role in 
reducing children’sSHS exposure, 
especially in private settings such as 
the home and vehicles, by counseling 
smoking parents and other caretakers 
who might accompany their children 
during pediatric visits. Pediatric 
clinicians have direct contact with 
a quarter of the nation’s smokers 
through child health visits and can 
be an important source of smoking 
cessation counseling for parents who 
are uninsured but have their children 
covered by Medicaid.20 Engaging 
parents who smoke in brief smoking 
cessation counseling has been shown 
to increase rates of quit attempts by 
parents and is recommended by the 
American Academy of Pediatrics.20,21
Notably, for all environments 
that were assessed, no significant 
differences in self-reported SHS 
exposure were observed between 
exclusive users of cigarettes or 
e-cigarettes. Use of e-cigarettes 
and other electronic nicotine 
delivery system (ENDS) in public 
indoor areas might passively 
expose bystanders (eg, children, 
nonsmokers) to nicotine and other 
potentially harmful constituents.22–28 
Moreover, some ENDS can be 
modified to deliver marijuana and 
other psychoactive substances.29 
Prohibitions on ENDS use in public 
places are critical to maintain clean 
indoor air standards and to help

support tobacco-free norms.17 In 
addition, such restrictions could 
simplify and enhance smoke-free law 
enforcement because some ENDS use 
can be difficult to distinguish from 
conventional smoking.17
These findings emphasize the 
importance of implementing 
interventions to protect children in 
private environments, including in 
multiunit housing and in vehicles. 
Some states have implemented 
smoke-free laws prohibiting smoking 
in public multiunit housing and in 
private vehicles when children are 
present.4 Research also shows an 
increase in the number of public 
housing authorities, municipalities, 
and operators of private market-
rate multiunit housing that have 
implemented smoke-free building 
policies prohibiting smoking in 
indoor areas, including living units.30 
Such policies are important in 
reducing exposure among children, 
considering that children occupy at 
least one-third of US households.31
The findings in this study are 
subject to at least 3 limitations. 
First, because SHS exposure was 
self-reported and not confirmed 
by biological markers such as 
serum cotinine, the findings may 
have been subject to misreporting 
when compared with studies using 
objective biomarkers of exposure.5,32 
However, self-reported SHS exposure 
is a valid measure that has been 
used in several epidemiologic 
studies.6,11–13,33 Second, NYTS data 
may not be generalizable to youth 
who are being homeschooled, those 
that have dropped out of school, or 
those in detention centers. However, 
data from the Current Population 
Survey indicate that 98.2% of US 
youth aged 10 to 13 years and 96.1% 
of those aged 14 to 17 years were 
enrolled in a traditional school in 
2013.34 Finally, respondents could 
potentially have been exposed to SHS 
from other sources not assessed in 
NYTS. Moreover, we only assessed 
recent (past 7-day) exposure, which 
may underestimate prevalence 
of exposure among occasionally 
exposed individuals not captured by 
a measure of past 7-day exposure.
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, in 2013, nearly 6 in 10 
US middle and high school students, 
including approximately half (48.0%) 
of never tobacco users, reported 
exposure to SHS. Never tobacco 
users with no smoke-free home or 
vehicle rules reported significantly 
higher levels of SHS exposure 
compared with those with 100% 
smoke-free rules. This underscores 
the importance of implementing 
voluntary 100% smoke-free 
home and vehicle rules, in concert 
with comprehensive smoke-free 
laws that prohibit smoking in all 
indoor areas of workplaces, bars, 
restaurants, and other public 
areas, to protect nonsmokers from 
SHS exposure. These findings also 
indicate that opportunities exist 
for intensified tobacco educational 
programs targeted at youths, 
particularly former tobacco users, 
on the importance of avoiding SHS 
exposure.
