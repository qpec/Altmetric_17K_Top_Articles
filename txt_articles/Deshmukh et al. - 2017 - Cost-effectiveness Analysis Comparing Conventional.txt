Abstract
Background: Early-stage breast cancer is among the most prevalent and costly malignancies treated in the American health
care system. Adjuvant radiotherapy after lumpectomy represents a substantial portion of breast cancer expenditures. The
relative value of novel radiotherapeutic approaches such as intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) and hypofractionated whole
breast irradiation (HF-WBI) compared with conventionally fractionated whole breast irradiation (CF-WBI) is unknown.
Therefore, we used prospectively collected outcomes from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to compare the cost-
effectiveness of these approaches.
Methods: We constructed a decision-analytic model that followed women who were treated with lumpectomy for early-stage
breast cancer. Recurrence, mortality, complication rates, and utilities (five-year radiation-associated quality of life scores), were
extracted from RCTs. Costs were based on Medicare reimbursement rates. Cost-effectiveness from societal and health care sector
perspectives was estimated considering two scenarios—the first assumes that radiation-associated disutility persists five years
after treatment, and the second assumes that disutility discontinues. Lifetime outcomes were summarized using incremental
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluated the robustness of the results.
Results: HF-WBI dominated CF-WBI (ie, resulted in higher quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] and lower cost) in all scenarios.
HF-WBI also had a greater likelihood of cost-effectiveness compared with IORT; under a societal perspective that assumes
that radiation-associated disutility persists, HF-WBI results in an ICER of $17 024 per QALY compared with IORT with a proba-
bility of cost-effectiveness of 80% at the $100 000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. If radiation-associated disutility
is assumed to discontinue, the ICER is lower ($11 461/QALY), resulting in an even higher (83%) probability of relative cost-
effectiveness. The ICER was most sensitive to the probability of metastasis and treatment cost.
Conclusions: For women with early-stage breast cancer requiring adjuvant radiotherapy, HF-WBI is cost-effective compared
with CF-WBI and IORT.
Value-based care has captured the attention of policy-makers
for controlling costs and maintaining quality (1–4). Breast can-
cer has the highest incidence among solid organ malignancies
in the United States and is therefore a critical target for control-
ling aggregate expenditures in oncology. Furthermore, 60% of
the 250 000 breast cancer patients diagnosed annually present

 with early-stage disease, for which adjuvant radiotherapy fol-
lowing lumpectomy or breast conserving surgery (BCS) is a ma-
jor contributor to treatment costs (5).
Conventionally fractionated whole breast irradiation (CF-
WBI) involves a daily treatment schedule lasting five to seven
weeks and has been mainstay of adjuvant radiation in the
United States. Two newer radiotherapy techniques hold
promise for reducing treatment time, lowering costs, and im-
proving quality of life. The first, hypofractionated whole
breast irradiation (HF-WBI), is an alternative form of exter-
nally delivered whole breast treatment that utilizes approxi-
mately 15 to 20 sessions (three to four weeks) of daily
treatments. HF-WBI has been shown in several randomized
trials to be equally efficacious and less toxic than CF-WBI for
nearly
all
patients
with
early-stage
breast
cancer
(6,7).
However, the uptake of HF-WBI among women receiving BCS
remains low (8).
The second alternative to CF-WBI is intraoperative radio-
therapy (IORT), which entails treating the breast tissue around
the tumor cavity in a single treatment session, which occurs
during the lumpectomy procedure itself (9–13). The efficacy of
this technique has been evaluated in two recently published
randomized trials—the Electron Intraoperative Radiotherapy
Trial (ELIOT) and the TARGeted Intraoperative Radiotherapy
Trial (TARGIT-A) (11,12). IORT is especially compelling as a way
to improve access among patients for whom external radiation
is burdensome, such as those who cannot travel long distances
to radiation facilities and those with advanced age or poor so-
cioeconomic status (14–16). However, IORT is associated with
modestly worse local control outcomes than CF-WBI, which
over the long term may alter differences in quality of life and
costs of care.
The wealth of clinical trial data comparing conventional and
newer forms of radiotherapy provides a critical opportunity to
compare the relative value proposition of these approaches. To
that end, we utilized data collected from randomized trials in
combination with decision-analytic methods to perform a
rigorous value-based comparative cost-effectiveness analysis of
IORT, HF-WBI, and CF-WBI.
Methods
Model Overview and Baseline Cohort
We constructed a Markov-based state transition model to simu-
late the clinical course of women treated for early-stage breast
cancer (Figure 1). The baseline cohort was comprised of women
with an age range of 45 to 75 years treated with BCS for stage I/II
breast cancer. To advance time in our model, we used an annual
cycle length. A more detailed description of the model is pre-
sented in the Supplementary Methods (available online). Key
model parameters are presented in Table 1.
Comparators and Model Structure
All women enter the model disease free, having received either
IORT at the time of surgery or postoperative HF-WBI or CF-WBI.
Similar to the ELIOT (12), our model assumed that 5% of all pa-
tients who received IORT received additional radiation using
conventional fractionation of 2 Gy to a total dose of 50 Gy.
In the model, patients transition among mutually exclusive
and collectively exhaustive health states descriptive of the clini-
cal course after BCS. During each cycle, the baseline cohort of
disease-free women could remain disease-free or else could suf-
fer locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, or death attrib-
uted to breast cancer or other unrelated causes (12). Local and
regional recurrence in women who received HF-WBI or CF-WBI
could be addressed with salvage mastectomy followed by recon-
struction. Women with local recurrence after IORT were as-
sumed to have a 50% chance of salvage with lumpectomy and
adjuvant whole breast irradiation (WBI) (17).

all women enter in a “disease-free” health state. As time progresses, women transition from one health state to another and acquire cost and utilities associated with
that health state. Women at any stage may transition to death attributed to breast cancer or other unrelated causes. The model is structured over the time horizon of
lifetime. CF-WBI ¼ conventionally fractionated whole breast irradiation; HF-WBI ¼ hypofractionated whole breast irradiation; IORT ¼ intraoperative radiation therapy.

 Data Sources
Clinical Data
Risks of local recurrence, distant metastases, and mortality fol-
lowing either IORT or WBI were derived from the ELIOT trial
(Table 1; Supplementary Methods, available online). This trial
randomly assigned 1305 women older than age 48 years with tu-
mors less than 2.5 cm in diameter treated with breast conserva-
tion surgery (BSC) to either IORT or CF-WBI. IORT was delivered
as a single dose of 21 Gy prescribed to the 90% depth using intra-
operative electrons. CF-WBI was delivered to the whole breast
to a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions, followed by a 10 Gy boost in
five fractions. With a median follow-up of 5.8 years, the five-
year locoregional recurrence rate was 5.4% for IORT vs 0.8% for
the CF-WBI (P < .001) (12). Locoregional recurrence risk (LRR),
distant metastasis risk (DMR), and mortality outcomes were de-
rived from the ELIOT rather than the TARGIT-A because the
ELIOT had a longer follow-up, delivered a higher dose to the tu-
mor bed, and utilized consistent external beam technique (ie,
all patients received a boost). For our models, we also assumed
that women who had both IORT and WBI had the same rate of
LRR as women who had WBI alone (18,19).
For comparing HF-WBI and CF-WBI, we used 10-year
follow-up data from two large randomized controlled trials
that
demonstrated
equivalent
LRR,
DMR,
and
mortality
between the two external beam therapies (6,9,20). Risk of me-
tastases after salvage mastectomy was derived from pub-
lished sources (21,22).
Breast cancer mortality and other-cause mortality during
the first five years after BCS were derived from the ELIOT (12).
After the first five years, we extrapolated age-specific breast
cancer mortality risk and other-cause mortality risk and vali-
dated the trend in mortality by comparing it with the 15-year
breast and all-cause mortality trend from a previously pub-
lished meta-analysis (23).
Costs
Direct medical care costs, including physician and hospital re-
imbursement for surgical procedures and respective radiation
modalities, were obtained from the 2016 Medicare Physician Fee
Schedule (24) and Outpatient Prospective Payment System (25)
(Table 1). Estimates for indirect care, routine follow-up, and
metastatic care costs were obtained from the literature and con-
verted to 2016 US dollars using consumer price indices for medi-
cal care (26–29). (Additional cost input details are in the

 Quality of Life Scores (Utilities)
We estimated longitudinal utilities for CF-WBI, HF-WBI, and
IORT using recently published non-preference-based five-year
quality of life clinical trial data measured using the Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Breast (FACT-B; version 4) in-
strument
and
a
mapping
algorithm
or
a
cross-walk
(Supplementary Figure 1, available online) (30). In this trial,
women age 40 years or older with pathologically confirmed
early-stage breast cancer who underwent BCS were randomly
assigned to treatment with either CF-WBI or HF-WBI and were
followed over five years to assess quality of life (30). We then
used a mapping algorithm to convert the quality of life score
into preference-based utilities. We used averages and standard
deviations from the FACT-B subscales, which were available to
us from personal communication. Longitudinal utilities after
salvage mastectomy and reconstruction, salvage lumpectomy,
and metastatic breast cancer were obtained from the published
literature (31,32). In addition, the age-specific differential qual-
ity of life multipliers were obtained from Hanmer et al. (33).
Additional details and utilities are presented in Supplementary
Methods and Supplementary Table 2 (available online).
Analysis
Cost-effectiveness Analysis
To perform cost-effectiveness analysis, we followed the guide-
lines by the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and
Medicine (34). Base case outcomes were estimated for a cohort
of women age 50 years who received BCS followed by IORT, HF-
WBI, or CF-WBI. Outcomes were estimated assuming both US
societal and health care sector perspectives as recommended
(34). Comparative assessment was performed by computing an
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (the ratio of difference in
expected costs and expected QALYs associated with the alterna-
tive strategies). We used a lifetime horizon and discounted all
future costs and QALYs using an annual discount rate of 3%.
For each perspective, we explored two scenarios wherein
1) radiation-associated disutility or side effects persist after year
5 and 2) radiation-associated disutility discontinues after year 5.
These scenarios were utilized because radiation-associated
quality of life beyond five years after treatment is not suffi-
ciently described in the literature.
Sensitivity Analysis
To evaluate the robustness of the outcomes, we performed
comprehensive sensitivity analysis. Deterministic (one-way
and two-way) sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying
model input parameters. In addition, decision uncertainty was
evaluated using probabilistic sensitivity analysis and the out-
comes were reported as probability of cost-effectiveness at
US$50 000 per QALY and US$100 000 per QALY and cost-
effectiveness acceptability curves. Finally, we estimated cost-
effectiveness using model input parameters from the TARGIT-A
clinical trial (11).
Model Validation
We performed comprehensive model validation as recom-
mended by the Assessment of the Validation Status of Health-
Economic decision models (AdViSHE) (35). First, we cross-vali-
dated our model by comparing model-predicted 10-year overall
survival for women age 55 years to the survival estimated in a
previously published cost-effectiveness analysis (details are
presented in the Supplementary Methods, available online) (36).
Second, we independently validated our model by comparing
five-year and 10-year survival in women age 50 years by com-
paring predicted survival by a web-based prediction tool:
Predictonline! (Supplementary Table 3, available online) (37).
We also compared model-predicted five-year and 10-year local
recurrence rates to the empirical data not used to build the
model. (Supplementary Table 4, available online). The accuracy

 of our model was validated as all model predicted outcomes
were within the plausible range of reported outcomes.
Results
Cost-effectiveness Analysis
The results of base case cost-effectiveness analysis are pre-
sented in Table 2. Notably, HF-WBI dominated CF-WBI in all sce-
narios because CF-WBI was associated with increased costs and
decreased QALYs regardless of model assumptions.
HF-WBI was more cost-effective than IORT in most scenar-
ios. In the base case using a societal perspective and assuming
that radiation-associated disutility persists beyond five years,
we found that the ICER associated with HF-WBI compared with
IORT was $17 024 per QALY (Table 2). The probability that HF-
WBI was cost-effective was 75% and 80% at willingness-to-pay
thresholds
of
$50 000
per
QALY
and
$100 000
per
QALY,
respectively. Under the alternative scenario where radiation-
associated disutility was assumed to discontinue after five
years, we found that the ICER for HF-WBI compared with IORT
was $11 461 per QALY. The probability that HF-WBI was cost-
effective was higher than the base case, increasing to 76% and
83% at $50 000 per QALY and $100 000 per QALY.
When the outcomes comparing HF-WBI and IORT were esti-
mated using a health care sector perspective instead of a socie-
tal perspective, we found that the ICER again was in favor of HF-
WBI: Under the scenarios that assume that radiation-associated
disutility persists or discontinues beyond five years after treat-
ment, the ICERs were $14 886 per QALY and $10 022 per QALY,
respectively (Table 2).

 one-way sensitivity analysis, are presented in the form of a tor-
nado diagram (Figure 2). We found that the ICER was sensitive
to the treatment cost of HF-WBI and IORT (Figure 2A). The ICER
was also sensitive to the probability of metastasis after treat-
ment (Figure 2B). However, under no alternative scenario, the
ICER exceeded the threshold of $100 000 per QALY.
In the two-way sensitivity analysis, we found that the ICER
was sensitive to the linear combination of the probability of me-
tastasis after HF-WBI and IORT; when base case parameters were
used, then HF-WBI was most cost-effective. The region of cost-
effectiveness under the possible combination of probability of me-
tastasis after HF-WBI and IORT is presented in Supplementary
Figure 2 (available online). We also found that the ICER was sensi-
tive to the linear combination of cost of HF-WBI and age, and cost
of IORT and age (Supplementary Figures 3 and 4, available online).
Additional sensitivity analyses are presented in Table 3.
Notably, the ICER for HF-WBI compared with IORT increases
with older age. However, under no sensitivity analysis did the
ICER exceed the willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per
QALY.
Using probabilistic sensitivity analysis, we estimated that
HF-WBI was the most cost-effective strategy at the willingness-
to-pay threshold of $10 000 per QALY or higher for the base case
population (Figure 3A). We then found that the probability that
HF-WBI is cost-effective decreases with increase in age across
the willingness-to-pay threshold (Figure 3B). Finally, when
model inputs (ie, local and regional recurrence, risk of metasta-
sis, and mortality) from TARGIT-A were used (Supplementary
Table 5, available online), we found that the incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio further decreased (ie, the ICER was $6277/
QALY) (Supplementary Table 6, available online).
Discussion
Individual patients have more recently been willing to adopt
the posture of a discerning consumer—searching for high qual-
ity at relatively low cost—because of their increased exposure to
the costs of care secondary to rising copayments and the prolif-
eration of high-deductible insurance plans. Likewise, an urgent
goal for health care purchasers and policy-makers is to incen-
tivize interventions that are clinically effective but also entail
sustainable costs for managing whole populations of patients.
This focus on value for selecting treatment is especially apt for
clinical scenarios with three features: The indication for treat-
ment is highly prevalent, several treatment options exist with
similar clinical efficacy, and the costs and toxicity profiles vary
across the treatment options.
In the oncology landscape, this constellation of features is
represented well by treatment selection among the adjuvant ra-
diotherapy options available after breast conservation surgery.
To identify which among the treatment options entailed the
best value, we utilized prospective outcomes from major ran-
domized clinical trials to compare the cost-effectiveness of CF-
WBI, HF-WBI, and IORT. We found that HF-WBI is cost-effective
compared with IORT and CF-WBI from both a societal and
health care sector perspective. Of note, because our model was
based on data from well-designed clinical trials, few supple-
mentary assumptions were needed to complete the analysis.
The one major modeling assumption for which long-term data
was unavailable was whether radiation-associated disutility
persisted or ceased beyond five years of follow-up. We found
that under either circumstance, the ICER for HF-WBI remained
well below the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold of
$100 000 per QALY. In other words, HF-WBI was the most cost-
effective option under all modeling scenarios.
The sensitivity analyses highlight an important caveat to
the interpretation of our results. Namely, the comparative
value of hypofractionated radiotherapy is contingent on the
costs of therapy as well as on relative recurrence rates. The
costs used in our analysis were based on current reimburse-
ment rates, but it is intuitive that a lower price point for intrao-
perative radiotherapy or higher price of hypofractionated
radiotherapy could tilt the cost-effectiveness calculation in fa-
vor of IORT, particularly in older women. Similarly, our model
based IORT clinical outcomes on the ELIOT trial, which demon-
strated modestly inferior tumor control compared with WBI.
However, the ELIOT trial allowed participation of patients who
were at higher risk for recurrence than patients deemed “suit-
able” for accelerated partial breast irradiation (aPBI) in the 2009
ASTRO consensus statement. According to an analysis by

 Orecchia and colleagues, the 23% of ELIOT patients who did fit
the suitability criteria were estimated to have a five-year local
recurrence risk of only 1.5% (38,39). This suggests that for prop-
erly selected low-risk patients for whom there is minimal an-
ticipation of downstream costs for treating recurrences, a
single intraoperative radiation session may turn out to be cost-
effective compared with HF-WBI. However, even if IORT costs
are modified such that this technique becomes the more cost-
effective option, IORT requires special equipment and techni-
cal competencies, which will need to be overcome for more
widespread adoption.
Despite the expectation that CF-WBI would be dominated by
HF-WBI under all alternative scenarios as HF-WBI is less costly,
equally effective, and probably less toxic than CF-WBI, we in-
cluded CF-WBI as a comparator. This is because the uptake of
HF-WBI in the United States still remains low and majority of the
women are still undergoing CF-WBI (8). Therefore, the analysis
was conducted to address the following question: What is the
cost-effectiveness of replacing existing practice (CF-WBI) with a
new intervention (IORT) or relevant alternative (HF-WBI)?
An important limitation of our study revolves around uncer-
tainty surrounding quality of life assumptions. As in other stud-
ies, quality of life is a subjective outcome that varies from
individual to individual and greatly depends on the survey in-
struments. Because the external beam radiation arm utilized
CF-WBI, it is likely that the difference in utility between IORT
and HF-WBI would not be as pronounced. However, it is worth-
while to point out that the impact of this change on our model
would actually make our primary conclusion, that HF-WBI is
more cost-effective than IORT, stronger.
In conclusion, in selecting among HF-WBI, CF-WBI, and IORT
for adjuvant radiotherapy after breast conservation surgery, HF-
WBI is the most cost-effective option. At a lower price point,
IORT could become a convenient, high-value intervention for
older patients at low risk of requiring salvage therapy.
