Although a causal relationship between Zika virus (ZIKV) and
microcephaly has been established, it remains unclear why ZIKV,
but not other pathogenic flaviviruses, causes congenital defects.
Here we show that when viruses are produced in mammalian cells,
ZIKV, but not the closely related dengue virus (DENV) or West Nile
virus (WNV), can efficiently infect key placental barrier cells that
directly contact the fetal bloodstream. We show that AXL, a receptor
tyrosine kinase, is the primary ZIKV entry cofactor on human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and that ZIKV uses AXL
with much greater efficiency than does DENV or WNV. Consistent
with this observation, only ZIKV, but not WNV or DENV, bound the
AXL ligand Gas6. In comparison, when DENV and WNV were
produced in insect cells, they also infected HUVECs in an AXL-
dependent manner. Our data suggest that ZIKV, when produced
from mammalian cells, infects fetal endothelial cells much more
efficiently than other pathogenic flaviviruses because it binds Gas6
more avidly, which in turn facilitates its interaction with AXL.
Zika virus | Flaviviruses | AXL | placental barrier | fetal endothelial cell
Z
ika (ZIKV), West Nile (WNV), and dengue (DENV) viruses
are closely related, and belong to the Flavivirus genus in the
Flaviviridae family. Although a causal relation between ZIKV and
microcephaly has been established by human and animal studies
(1–7), it remains unclear why only ZIKV, but not other pathogenic
flaviviruses, causes congenital diseases. Although WNV is known
to infect neuronal cells and results in encephalitis (8), it does not
cause microcephaly. DENV is not generally neurotropic and is not
linked to congenital defects.
To reach the fetal brain, a virus must be transported from the
maternal to the fetal circulation, which necessitates crossing of the
placental barrier. In the placenta, fetal blood in capillaries is
separated from maternal blood by placental barrier cells, namely
trophoblasts and fetal endothelial cells. Recent studies indicate
that the placenta and its barrier cells are infected by ZIKV, and
fetal brain lesions develop in mice, pigtail macaques, and humans
(1–6, 9). However, it remains unclear why only ZIKV, and not
other neurotropic flaviviruses, results in microcephaly and other
congenital disorders.
Although bona fide entry receptors for flaviviruses remain un-
known, many cell surface-expressed molecules contribute to in-
fection, including C-type lectins dendritic cell-specific intercellular
adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and DC-
SIGN–related protein (L-SIGN) (10, 11) and phosphatidylserine
(PS) receptors (12–15). PS receptors, which serve as entry cofac-
tors for flaviviruses, include members of the TIM (T-cell Ig mucin)
family and the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK) family. TIM-
family receptors bind PS directly (14, 15), whereas TAM-family
members bind PS indirectly, through the soluble intermediates
Gas6 (growth arrest-specific 6) and protein S present in serum and
other bodily fluids (16, 17). Whereas Gas6 binds to all three TAM
family members with high affinity, protein S binds to TYRO3 and
MERTK, but not to AXL (17). The TAM receptor AXL was
recently shown to support ZIKV infection of human foreskin fi-
broblasts (12), and its expression was noted in the brain and
neuroprogenitor cells (18–21). However, its deletion had no effect
on ZIKV infection of induced pluripotent human stem cell-derived
neuroprogenitor cells or cerebral organoids (22) or on virus accu-
mulation of the eye, brain, or testis in Axl−/− mice (23, 24). Expression
of other flavivirus entry cofactors (genatlas.medecine.univ-paris5.fr/
fiche.php?onglet=4&n=26146, genatlas.medecine.univ-paris5.fr/fiche.
php?onglet=4&n=1364, and refs. 22 and 25) in addition to AXL,
however, might have compensated for the absence of AXL in these
cells and tissues.
In contrast, we show here that AXL is the only relevant ZIKV
entry cofactor expressed on fetal endothelial cells, and that when
produced in mammalian cells, only ZIKV, but not WNV or
DENV, can use AXL, because it more efficiently binds Gas6.
These differences may help explain why only ZIKV, and not
other flaviviruses, can access the fetal bloodstream to infect fetal
tissues and cause microcephaly.
Significance
Zika virus (ZIKV) causes microcephaly, whereas other related
pathogenic flaviviruses do not. To reach the fetal brain, a virus
must be transported from the maternal to the fetal circulation,
which requires crossing of the placental barrier. Our studies
demonstrate that mammalian cell-derived ZIKV, but not two
other globally relevant flaviviruses, efficiently infects fetal en-
dothelial cells, a key component of the placental barrier, because
only ZIKV can efficiently use the cell-surface receptor AXL. These
data suggest that use of AXL allows ZIKV to enter the fetal
bloodstream to gain access to other fetal tissues. Thus, this study
provides insight into the unique properties of ZIKV that con-
tribute to its ability to cause microcephaly and other congenital
infections and diseases.

 Results
Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells Are More Susceptible to ZIKV
than to DENV or WNV. To investigate why ZIKV, and not closely
related flaviviruses (e.g., WNV and DENV), causes microcephaly,
we initially evaluated the susceptibility to ZIKV, DENV, and
WNV of fetal endothelial cells, which serve as a barrier between
the placenta and fetal tissues. We propagated viruses in a mam-
malian cell line (Vero 76), rather than a commonly used insect cell
line, to more accurately reflect the virus population generated
during maternal infection. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs) from three independent donors (donors 1 to 3) or
pooled HUVECs from additional donors (donor 4) were infected
at various multiplicities of infection (MOIs of 0.1 to 1.0) with
ZIKV
(FSS13025,
Cambodia),
DENV
(serotype
2,
New
Guinea C), or WNV (lineage I, New York 1999). At all MOIs
and in all four HUVEC preparations, ZIKV infection was
much more efficient than WNV or DENV (Fig. 1 A–C and Fig.
S1 A–C). To confirm that the higher level of ZIKV infection
was not an artifact of preferential recognition of ZIKV E
protein by the pan-flavivirus antibody 4G2, we compared 4G2
staining with that by virus-specific antibodies and observed no
qualitative difference (Fig. S1D and Table S1). ZIKV progeny
viruses in the culture supernatants, as measured by plaque
assays, also showed ∼100- and 1,000-fold higher titers than
those from WNV- and DENV-infected cells, respectively (Fig.
1D). Thus, ZIKV infects primary fetal endothelial cells to a
substantially greater level than does DENV or WNV.
AXL Is the Primary ZIKV Entry Cofactor in HUVECs. To identify the
mechanism by which ZIKV infected HUVECs, we measured the
surface expression of several established flavivirus entry cofactors:
TIM- and TAM-family receptors, and DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. All
HUVECs expressed AXL, as previously reported (26), and, at
lower levels, MERTK (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2A). No expression was
observed for other entry cofactors, indicating they do not con-
tribute to the infection of HUVECs by these viruses. The speci-
ficity of the antibodies was confirmed by staining relevant molecules
ectopically expressed in HEK293T cells (Fig. S2B).
To determine whether AXL expression on HUVECs con-
tributed to ZIKV infection, cells were preincubated with an anti-
AXL antibody, which blocks Gas6 binding but induces AXL
phosphorylation (27, 28). ZIKV infection in HUVECs was ef-
fectively inhibited by the anti-AXL antibody, but not by control
IgG (Fig. 2B). The same antibody did not inhibit the infection of
influenza A virus (IAV), which does not use any TIM or TAM
family members (13, 15). We similarly assessed the role of
MERTK in ZIKV infection of HUVECs. An anti-MERTK an-
tibody, which also blocks Gas6 binding (29), did not inhibit
ZIKV infection (Fig. 2C). To corroborate these findings, we used
two genetic approaches: CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and siRNA
gene silencing. Both methods reduced AXL expression to un-
detectable levels, and abolished ZIKV infection as judged by
intracellular staining of E protein (Fig. 2 D and E). Collectively,
these data indicate that AXL is the primary cofactor for ZIKV
infection of fetal endothelial cells.
ZIKV, but Not DENV or WNV, Efficiently Uses AXL. To investigate
whether the differential ability of ZIKV, WNV, and DENV to
infect HUVECs was due to distinct AXL-use patterns, we evalu-
ated the effect of the AXL antibody on infection of HUVECs by
these viruses produced from Vero 76 cells. We used a high MOI of
20 to obtain measurable intracellular staining levels of WNV and
DENV infection (Fig. S3A) and an MOI of 1 for progeny virus
titering (Fig. 3A). Infection of WNV and DENV was not affected
by the anti-AXL antibody, whereas ZIKV infection was markedly
reduced. We then conducted similar experiments in Vero 76 cells,
which support efficient infection of all three viruses, likely because
multiple flavivirus entry cofactors are expressed on these cells. We
obtained similar results from these cells, using reporter virus-like
particles (RVPs), which are capable of single-round infection (Fig.
S3B). Again, only ZIKV RVP infection was inhibited by the anti-
AXL antibody. We then assessed AXL use by these viruses by
titering their progeny viruses produced from AXL-KO and control
HUVECs (Fig. 3B). Whereas ZIKV titer was substantially de-
creased, WNV and DENV titers were only marginally reduced.
We confirmed these AXL-use patterns using HEK293T cells ec-
topically expressing AXL. Note that parental HEK293T cells lack
endogenous expression of DC-SIGN and AXL, and DC-SIGN
was included as a control, because it is used by many flaviviruses to
enter cells (10, 11). Only ZIKV infection was enhanced in AXL-
expressing cells, whereas infection by all three flaviviruses was
increased in DC-SIGN–expressing cells, compared with the pa-
rental HEK293T cells (Fig. 3C). Although the basal infection of
the parental HEK293T cells by WNV and DENV is much higher
than that by ZIKV, AXL use by WNV or DENV was not apparent
even at low MOIs, in contrast to that seen with DC-SIGN. These
data verify that the low level of WNV and DENV infection ob-
served in HUVECs was not mediated by AXL.

 Gas6 Binds to ZIKV, but Not to DENV or WNV. To assess whether
AXL utilization by ZIKV was mediated by the AXL ligand Gas6,
we first attempted to inhibit virus–AXL interaction with C-Gas6-
Ig, an Ig-fusion form of a human Gas6 variant that contains only
the C-terminal half (AXL-binding domain) of the molecule. This
construct thus lacks the PS-binding domain. TIM1(AA)-Ig does
not bind PS (13), and was used as a negative control. At 0.4 μg/mL,
C-Gas6-Ig substantially inhibited the infection of HUVECs by
ZIKV (Fig. 4 A and B), indicating that ZIKV associates with AXL
at the same site where Gas6 binds, and suggesting that AXL use by
ZIKV is mediated by Gas6. Note that serum concentrations of
Gas6 in healthy humans range from 13 to 100 ng/mL (30–32),
and that Gas6 in medium containing 10% (vol/vol) FBS is suf-
ficient for maximal transduction by various viruses mediated by
AXL (33). Although various tissues and cells produce Gas6,
the scale of this production is unknown.
To investigate whether ZIKV, but not WNV or DENV, inter-
acts with Gas6, we performed a modified immunoprecipitation
assay. Viruses were preincubated with Gas6-Ig, C-Gas6-Ig, or
TIM1-Ig, and bound to protein A-Sepharose beads. Captured
viruses were quantified by RT-quantitative (q)PCR of the viral
RNA or visualized by Western blot (Fig. 4 C and D and Fig. S4).
C-Gas6-Ig was used as a negative control, and TIM1-Ig was used
as a positive control, because all three viruses use TIM1 to infect
cells (Fig. S5) (13, 15). ZIKV, but not DENV or WNV, was
captured by Gas6-Ig immobilized on protein A beads. As expected,
no virus was captured by C-Gas6-Ig, and all three viruses were
captured by TIM1-Ig. Together, these data demonstrate that ZIKV,
but not WNV or DENV, can efficiently use AXL, because only
ZIKV is able to bind Gas6 efficiently.
Insect Cell-Derived DENV and WNV also Use AXL. Although our data
indicate that Vero 76-produced DENV and WNV do not use
AXL, AXL-dependent infection by DENV and WNV has been
reported by others (14, 34). We investigated whether differences in
virus producer cells could influence infection outcomes, and
therefore repeated our infection studies with virus produced in
C6/36 insect cells. Note that viruses were produced in insect cells
in the studies by Meertens et al. (14) (DENV) and Bhattacharyya
et al. (34) (WNV) but in Vero 76 cells in our study. Infection of
HUVECs by C6/36-produced DENV and WNV was much more
efficient than that produced in Vero 76 cells, when infected at the
Fig. 2.

 same MOI, and was efficiently inhibited by the anti-AXL antibody,
judged by both intracellular staining and plaque assays of progeny
viruses (Fig. 5 A and B). Moreover, infection of C6/36-produced
WNV and DENV was substantially reduced in AXLKO
HUVECs relative to the parental HUVECs (Fig. 5 C and D).
To verify that mammalian cell-derived WNV and DENV do
not use AXL, we produced these viruses in human cell lines

 derived from these cell lines efficiently used AXL but DENV
and WNV did not (Fig. S6). Thus, DENV and WNV can use
AXL to infect HUVECs when produced from insect cells but
not when produced from mammalian cells.
Discussion
Our current studies show that mammalian cell-derived ZIKV effi-
ciently infects one of the two major placental barrier cells, namely
fetal endothelial cells, whereas WNV and DENV do not under the
same experimental conditions. This implies that fetal endothelial cells
serve as a barrier to WNV and DENV, but not to ZIKV, and may
contribute to the ability of ZIKV to disseminate to other fetal tissues.
Our studies also show that AXL is the primary cofactor for ZIKV
infection in these cells, and suggest that the differential infection of
HUVECs by ZIKV, WNV, and DENV is due in large part to the
different efficiencies with which they bind Gas6 and use AXL.
Tabata et al. recently reported that trophoblasts, the first layer
of the placental barrier, expressed TIM1 and were infected by
ZIKV (9). Although it is not yet established, WNV and DENV
likely infect primary trophoblasts because they both efficiently use
TIM1 (Fig. S5) (13, 15). This implies that the trophoblast layer
might not be an effective barrier for WNV, DENV, or ZIKV. In
comparison, our studies show that only ZIKV efficiently infects
fetal endothelial cells, another key placental barrier cell. A recent
study by Miner et al. showed that both trophoblasts and fetal
capillaries were infected and injured by ZIKV infection in a
pregnancy model in mice (3). Accordingly, it will be of interest to
determine whether fetal endothelial cells in the mouse model
present a barrier to DENV and WNV as suggested by our studies.
TAM receptors mediate phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in var-
ious tissues, including blood–brain barrier endothelial cells, retinal
pigment epithelial cells of the eye, and Sertoli cells of the testes
(25, 35, 36). This expression pattern is consistent with ZIKV
pathogenesis observed in the brain and eye and its ability to
transmit sexually (4, 37, 38). However, recent studies did not ob-
serve differences in ZIKV infection of the eye, brain, or testes
between wild-type and Axl−/− mice (23, 24). Similarly, Wells et al.
observed no difference in ZIKV infection between wild-type and
AXL-KO stem cell-derived neuroprogenitor cells and organoids
(22). Of note, Axl−/− mice exhibited elevated blood–brain barrier
permeability (39, 40). In addition, TIM1 is expressed at high levels
in retinal pigment epithelium and uroepithelium (genatlas.medecine.
univ-paris5.fr/fiche.php?onglet=4&n=26146), DC-SIGN and L-SIGN
are expressed in brain microvascular cells (25), and TYRO3 is
expressed in the brain and neuroprogenitor cells (genatlas.medecine.
univ-paris5.fr/fiche.php?onglet=4&n=1364 and ref. 22). Thus, it re-
mains possible that increased endothelium permeability in Axl−/−
mice could have contributed to the observed outcomes, and the
absence of AXL in those tissues of Axl−/− mice was compensated
for by other entry cofactors. In contrast, no functional flavivirus
entry cofactor other than AXL is expressed in HUVECs (Fig. 2A),
explaining its greater contribution to ZIKV infection in these cells
than in those tissues.
One outstanding question in the field is how PS receptors pro-
mote flavivirus infection, because structural studies show that the
E-protein shell occludes most of the virion membrane (41–43).
However, flavivirus particles assume many asymmetric states (44–46)
and are in continuous dynamic motion (47, 48), which likely exposes
patches of the virion membrane. In addition, mosaic virions—those
that are both mature and immature in patches—have been observed
functionally and by cryo-EM (47, 49–52). At present, it is unclear
why only ZIKV preferentially binds Gas6 whereas all three viruses
bind TIM1 (Fig. 4 and Fig. S4). One possible explanation is that
because Gas6 is a larger protein, relative to TIM1, it requires larger
patches of exposed virion membrane, which might be more available
on ZIKV than on WNV or DENV. Greater membrane exposure on
ZIKV could be achieved if its structural proteins facilitate increased
dynamic motion, or if more ZIKV particles are in a mosaic state. It
also remains uncertain why insect cell-derived DENV and WNV,
but not those produced in mammalian cells, can use AXL. Different
lipid composition in insect cells compared with mammalian cells
and the lower temperature used for virus production (e.g., 28 °C)
could affect assembly and thus the ensembles of conformational
states adopted. Clearly, the detailed mechanism by which ZIKV
binds Gas6 and uses AXL warrants further investigation.
In summary, our data suggest that the unique ability of ZIKV
to infect fetuses and cause congenital malformations may derive,

DENV and WNV produced in C6/36 cells use AXL, whereas those produced in Vero 76 cells do not. HUVECs preincubated with 50 nM anti-AXL (AF154) or

 at least in part, from its capacity to bind Gas6 and use AXL,
which may enable it to infect fetal endothelial cells and cross the
placental barrier more efficiently than other flaviviruses.
Materials and Methods
See SI Materials and Methods for detailed methods.
Virus Infection and Inhibition Assays. For infection assays, cells were incubated at
37 °C with viruses at the indicated MOI for 6 h (HUVECs) or 1 h (HEK293T and Vero
76 cells), and then further grown in fresh medium for 24 h (HUVECs and Vero
76 cells) or 48 h (HEK293T cells). Cells were stained with the pan anti-flavivirus
antibody 4G2, unless otherwise stated, or with the anti-IAV antibody (clone C179;
Takara), and analyzed by flow cytometry. For inhibition assays, the indicated
cells were preincubated with an anti-AXL (AF154; R&D Systems) or anti-
MERTK (AF891; R&D Systems) antibody for 20 min at room temperature,
infected with replication-competent viruses or reporter virus-like particles,
and analyzed as described above.
CRISPR/Cas9- and siRNA-Mediated Silencing of AXL Expression. To generate the
AXL gene-edited HUVECs, an AXL-specific single-guide (sg)RNA was cloned
into the lentiCRISPR v2 plasmid (Addgene; 52961). An untargeted sgRNA was
used as a control. HUVECs were transduced with lentiviruses coexpressing Cas9
and sgRNA, and selected with 1.5 μg/mL puromycin at 24 h posttransduction
for 4 d. To silence AXL expression, HUVECs (at 80 to 85% confluence) were
transfected with 25 nM untargeted or AXL-specific siRNA using DharmaFECT 4
reagent (Dharmacon). The day after transfection, cells were detached and plated
for further infection assays and the analysis of AXL cell-surface expression.
Gas6-Ig Binding to Viruses. ZIKV, DENV, and WNV were quantified by RT-qPCR
of their respective NS3 gene, mixed with Gas6-Ig, C-Gas6-Ig, or TIM1-Ig, and
incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After 1 h, protein A-Sepharose beads,
preblocked with 2% (vol/vol) BSA, were added and further incubated for 1 h
at room temperature on a rocking platform. After washing, bound viruses
were quantified by RT-qPCR of viral RNA or visualized by Western blot analyses
using anti-E protein antibodies 4G2 (ZIKV and DENV) or 3.91D (WNV).
Data and Statistics. The difference between groups was tested using an
unpaired two-tailed t test with Welch’s correction. The null hypothesis was
rejected when P < 0.01.
