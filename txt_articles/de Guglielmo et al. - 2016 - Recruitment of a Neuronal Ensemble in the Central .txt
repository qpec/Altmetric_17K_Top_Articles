decrease in alcohol drinking. Moreover, we observed a significant reduction of somatic withdrawal signs in dependent animals that were
injected with Daun02 in the CeA. These results indicate that the recruitment of a neuronal ensemble in the CeA during abstinence from

Introduction
Alcohol binge drinking and alcoholism lead to 3.3 million deaths
worldwide annually, but treatments are limited (Johnson, 2008).
Maladaptive behavioral patterns toward alcohol (e.g., compulsive
drinking) have been hypothesized to result from the lasting overac-
tivationofspecificneuronalensembles(Hebb,1949)intheextended
amygdala (George et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2015) that mediate the
negative emotional states of alcohol withdrawal (Koob et al., 2014)
and encode memories and motivation that are associated with
alcohol-related cues (Barak et al., 2013). Numerous studies have
identified a key role for the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) in
alcohol drinking and alcohol dependence (Wrase et al., 2008; Koob,
2009; Koob and Volkow, 2010; Gilpin et al., 2015). Multiple neuro-
peptide and neuromodulator systems appear to be dysregulated in
alcohol dependence and they appear to converge on GABA circuitry
in the CeA to produce excessive alcohol drinking and the negative
emotional symptoms of alcohol abstinence (Roberto et al., 2004;
Weiner and Valenzuela, 2006; Roberto et al., 2010; Gilpin et al.,
2015). However, it is unclear whether the CeA as a whole is critical
for the manifestation of alcohol dependence or if a discrete popula-

Significance Statement
Alcohol dependence recruits neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Here, we found that inactivation of a specific
dependence-induced neuronal ensemble in the CeA reversed excessive alcohol drinking and somatic signs of alcohol dependence
in rats. These results identify a critical neurobiological mechanism that is required for alcohol dependence, suggesting that
targeting dependence neuronal ensembles may lead to a better understanding of the etiology of alcohol use disorders, with
implications for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.

 tionofneuronsintheCeAisrequiredforexcessivealcoholdrinking.
A neuronal ensemble that is recruited in the anticipation of alcohol
binge drinking was identified recently in the CeA (George et al.,
2012). In this work, discrete populations of Fos-positive neurons
that are distributed throughout the brain were observed during ab-
stinence from alcohol drinking. The Fos-positive neuronal popula-
tionintheCeAwasoneoftheonlyensemblesthatwasonlyobserved
inratswithahistoryofescalationofalcoholdrinking(withintermit-
tent access to alcohol) and not in rats that presented stable alcohol
drinking (with continuous access to alcohol). These results strongly
suggested that a binge-drinking neuronal ensemble in the CeA may
encode the excessive motivation for alcohol that is observed in rats
withahistoryofalcoholbingedrinking.However,causalevidenceis
required to validate this hypothesis. Moreover, it is unknown
whether a similar neuronal ensemble can be identified in the CeA in
dependentratsandifthishypotheticaldependenceneuronalensem-
ble is required for dependence-induced drinking and the emergence
of withdrawal signs of dependence in rats. In the present study, we
tested the hypothesis that there are specific neuronal ensembles
(“abstinence neuronal ensembles”) that are required for alcohol-
binge-like drinking and dependence-induced drinking. We further
testedthehypothesisthattheseneuronalensemblesplayacausalrole
in alcohol drinking using the Daun02 inactivation technique (Fig.
1).Thisapproachallowsthespecificinactivationofneuronalensem-
bles that are recruited by a specific event or state without affecting
either the surrounding nonactivated neurons or neurons that are
activated by other stimuli or events. The Daun02 inactivation pro-
cedure uses Fos-LacZ transgenic rats that express �-galactosidase
(�-gal) under the control of the cfos promoter (Koya et al., 2009).
�-gal is induced only in strongly activated Fos� neurons and not in
surrounding nonactivated (Fos�) or weakly activated neurons
(Cruzetal.,2013).�-galinthesestronglyactivatedneuronsconverts

activity (Santone et al., 1986; Engeln et al., 2016) and then cell death

procedure provides a way to test whether a specific neuronal ensem-
ble is required for a specific behavior.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
Adult male Fos-LacZ transgenic rats, weighing 200–225 g at the begin-
ning of the experiments, were housed in groups of two per cage (self-
administration groups) or single housed (two-bottle choice) in a
temperature-controlled (22°C) vivarium on a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle
(lights on at 10:00 P.M.) with ad libitum access to food and water. All of
the behavioral tests were conducted during the dark phase of the light/
dark cycle. All of the procedures adhered to the National Institutes of
Health’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Scripps Research Institute.
Intermittent access to 20% ethanol in a two-bottle-choice
drinking paradigm
Two 100 ml graduated plastic bottles with stainless-steel drinking spouts
were inserted through two grommets in front of each cage 15 min after
the lights were turned off in the reversed light/dark cycle room. The rats
had ad libitum access to food and water every day and access to 20%
alcohol on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Both bottles were weighed
24 h after the fluids were presented and measurements were taken to the
nearest gram. The position of the bottles was switched every other day to
avoid side preference. The body weight of each rat was measured daily
Monday through Friday to calculate the grams of ethanol intake per
kilogram of body weight.
At the beginning of the experiment, the animals were given continuous
access to one bottle that contained a 20% alcohol solution and one bottle
that contained water. No initiation procedures were used before the first
alcohol drinking session. Once a stable baseline of alcohol intake was
reached, the rats were subjected to an intermittent-access, 20% alcohol-
drinking paradigm (i.e., Monday, Wednesday, and Friday).
Operant self-administration
Self-administration sessions were conducted in standard operant condi-
tioning chambers (Med Associates). For the alcohol self-administration
studies, the animals were first trained to self-administer 10% (w/v) alco-
hol and water solutions until a stable response pattern (20 � 5 rewards)
was maintained. The rats were subjected to an overnight session in the
operant chambers with access to one lever (right lever) that delivered
water (fixed-ratio 1, FR1). Food was available ad libitum during this
training. After 1 d off, the rats were subjected to a 2 h session (FR1) for 1 d
and a 1 h session (FR1) the next day, with 1 lever delivering alcohol (right
lever). All of the subsequent alcohol self-administration sessions lasted
30 min. The rats were allowed to self-administer a 10% (w/v) alcohol
solution (right lever) and water (left lever) on an FR1 schedule of rein-
forcement (i.e., each operant response was reinforced with 0.1 ml of the
solution). For the saccharin self-administration study, the rats under-
went daily 30 min FR1 sessions. Responses on the right lever resulted in
the delivery of 0.1 ml of saccharin (0.04%, w/v). Lever presses on the left

induces Fos expression and subsequently activates the c-fos promoter. As a result, the expression of lacZ mRNA and its protein product, �-galactosidase, is increased in these strongly activated
neurons, but not in the surrounding majority of neurons. The prodrug Daun02 is injected into the CeA and initially inactive. However, �-galactosidase catalyzes Daun02 to the active product
daunorubicin, which induces apoptosis and cell death only in those neurons that were activated strongly enough during withdrawal to induce �-galactosidase.

 lever delivered 0.1 ml of water. This procedure lasted 13 d until a stable
baseline of intake was reached.
Alcohol vapor chambers
The rats were trained previously to self-administer alcohol in the operant
chambers. Once a stable baseline of alcohol intake was reached, the rats
were made dependent by chronic intermittent exposure to alcohol va-
pors. They underwent cycles of 14 h on (blood alcohol levels during
vapor exposure ranged between 150 and 250 mg%) and 10 h off, during
which behavioral testing for acute withdrawal occurred (i.e., 6–8 h after
the vapor was turned off, when brain and blood alcohol levels are negli-
gible). In this model, rats exhibit somatic and motivational signs of with-
drawal (Vendruscolo and Roberts, 2014).
Operant self-administration and withdrawal scores during alcohol
vapor exposure
Behavioral testing occurred three times per week. The rats were tested for
alcohol or saccharin (and water) self-administration on an FR1 schedule
of reinforcement in 30 min sessions. Behavioral signs of withdrawal were
measured using a rating scale adapted from a previous study (Macey et
al., 1996) and included ventromedial limb retraction, irritability to touch
(vocalization), tail rigidity, abnormal gait, and body tremors. Each sign
was given a score of 0–2, based on the following severity scale: 0 � no
sign, 1 � moderate, and 2 � severe. The sum of the 4 observation scores
(0–8) was used as an operational measure of withdrawal severity. The
withdrawal ratings were scored by an operator blinded to the treatments.
Intracranial surgery
For intracranial surgery, the animals were anesthetized with isoflurane.
To reach the CeA, guide cannulas were implanted bilaterally using the
following coordinates with reference to bregma: anterior/posterior, �2.6
mm; medial/lateral, �4.2 mm; and dorsal/ventral, �6.1 mm. The ani-
mals were allowed to recover for 1 week after surgery.
Drugs
For intracranial injections, Daun02 was dissolved in a vehicle that con-
sisted of 90% artificial CSF, 5% dimethylsulfoxide, and 5% Tween 80 and
injected bilaterally in the CeA at a concentration of 2 �g/0.5 �l/site
through a stainless-steel injector that was 2 mm longer than the guide
cannula so that its tip protruded into the area.
Immunohistochemistry
At the end of the experiments, the rats were deeply anesthetized with
pentobarbital 8 h into withdrawal (self-administration studies) or 45 min
after the Daun02 injection (2-bottle choice experiment) and perfused
with 100 ml of PBS followed by 400 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde. The
brains were postfixed in paraformaldehyde overnight and transferred to
30% sucrose in PBS/0.1% azide solution at 4°C for 2–3 d. Brains were
frozen in powdered dry ice and sectioned on a cryostat. Coronal sections
were cut 40 �m thick between bregma �4.2 and �6.48 mm (Paxinos and
Watson, 2005) and collected free floating in PBS/0.1% azide solution.
After three washes in PBS, the sections were incubated in 1% hydrogen
peroxide/PBS (to quench endogenous peroxidase activity), rinsed 3
times in PBS, and blocked for 60 min in PBS that contained 0.3% Triton
X-100, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% normal donkey serum.
Sections were incubated for 24 h at 4°C with a rabbit monoclonal anti-
Fos antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies #2250) diluted 1:1000 in PBS/
0.5% Tween 20 and 5% normal donkey serum. The sections were washed
again with PBS and incubated for 1 h in undiluted Rabbit ImmPress HRP
reagent (Vector Laboratories). After washing in PBS, the sections were
developed for 2–6 min in peroxidase DAB substrate (Vector Laborato-
ries) enhanced with nickel chloride. After rinses in PBS, the sections were
mounted onto coated slides (Super Frost Plus; Fisher), air dried, dehy-
drated through a graded series of alcohol, cleared with Citrasolv (Fisher
Scientific), and coverslipped with DPX (Sigma-Aldrich).
Quantitative analysis to obtain unbiased estimates of the total number
of Fos� cell bodies was performed on a Zeiss Axiophot Microscope
equipped with MicroBrightField Stereo Investigator software, a three-
axis Mac 5000 motorized stage (Ludl Electronics), a Q Imaging Retiga
2000R color digital camera, and a PCI color frame grabber.
Three sections were bilaterally analyzed for each rat. Live video
images were used to draw contours (at 5� magnification) to delineate
the CeA. After determining the mounted section thickness and
Z-plane values, an optical fractionator probe was used to determine
the number of positive neurons within the CeA contours. Briefly, a
counting frame of appropriate dimensions, denoting forbidden and
nonforbidden boundaries, was superimposed on the video monitor
and Fos� cells were counted at 20� magnification. Cells were iden-
tified as neurons based on standard morphology and only neurons
with a focused nucleus within the nonforbidden regions of the count-
ing frame were counted. Counts from all images from each rat were
averaged so that each rat was an n of 1.
Experimental procedures
Experiment 1. Effect of inactivation of CeA neuronal ensembles in nonde-
pendent rats subjected to intermittent access to 20% ethanol. Fos LacZ
transgenic rats (n � 21) were given continuous access to 20% ethanol and
water. When a stable baseline of ethanol intake was reached, they were
moved to intermittent access as described above. Once alcohol escalation
was established, the animals underwent stereotaxic surgery for bilateral
intra-CeA injections. After 1 week of recovery, the rats were reexposed to
intermittent access to restore their previous baseline levels of ethanol
intake. At this point, the animals were divided into 2 groups that were
matched according to drinking levels and bilaterally injected with
Daun02 (2 �g/0.5 �l/site) or its vehicle 90 min before having access to
ethanol and water. Ethanol and water intake were recorded in five
ethanol-drinking sessions. On day 11 (see Fig. 1A), the animals were
injected again with Daun02 and transcardially perfused 90 min later, and
their brains were collected for immunohistochemical analysis.
Experiment 2. Effect of inactivation of CeA neuronal ensembles in
ethanol-dependent rats. Fos LacZ transgenic rats (n � 17) were trained to
self-administer 10% ethanol under an FR1 schedule of reinforcement
until a stable baseline of self-administration was reached. The rats were
then moved to alcohol vapor chambers and left undisturbed for 3 weeks.
At the beginning of the fourth week of vapor exposure, the rats were
subjected to an FR1 alcohol self-administration session 8 h into with-
drawal, when blood alcohol levels were negligible. When the escalation of
alcohol self-administration was established, the animals underwent ste-
reotaxic surgery for bilateral cannula implantation in the CeA. After 1
week of postsurgical recovery, the rats were returned to the self-
administration chambers to restore their previous baseline levels of eth-
anol self-administration. The animals were then divided into two groups
that were matched according to lever presses for alcohol and injected
bilaterally with Daun02 (2 �g/0.5 �l/site) or its vehicle 90 min before the
self-administration session. Lever pressing for ethanol and water was
recorded in five self-administration sessions. Withdrawal signs were
scored immediately before the last session. On day 11, the rats were
transcardially perfused at the same time as the usual behavioral testing,
and their brains were collected for immunohistochemical analysis.
Experiment 3. Effect of inactivation of CeA neuronal ensembles on
saccharin self-administration in ethanol-dependent rats. Fos LacZ trans-
genic rats (n � 12) were trained to self-administer 0.04% saccharin under
an FR1 schedule of reinforcement in 30 min sessions until a stable base-
line of self-administration was reached. The animals were then moved to
alcohol vapor chambers and left undisturbed for 3 weeks. At the begin-
ning of the fourth week of vapor exposure, the rats were subjected to
FR1 saccharin self-administration sessions 8 h into withdrawal, when
blood alcohol levels were negligible. When a stable level of saccharin
self-administration was established, the animals underwent stereotaxic
surgery for bilateral intra-CeA injections. After 1 week of postsurgical
recovery, the rats were returned to the self-administration chambers to
restore their previous baseline levels of saccharin self-administration.
The animals were then divided into 2 groups that were matched accord-
ing to lever presses for saccharin and bilaterally injected with Daun02
(2 �g/0.5 �l/side) or its vehicle 90 min before saccharin self-
administration. Lever presses for saccharin and water were recorded in
five self-administration sessions. Withdrawal signs were scored immedi-
ately before the last session. On day 11, the animals were transcardially

 perfused at the same time as the usual behavioral testing, and their brains
were collected for immunohistochemical analysis.
Statistical analysis
The results are expressed as mean � SEM. The data were analyzed using
two-way ANOVA, with treatment (vehicle or Daun02) as the between-
subjects factor and time (sessions or preescalation and postescalation) as the
within-subjects factor. The immunohistochemistry data were analyzed us-
ing one-way ANOVA. The ANOVAs were followed by the Newman–Keuls
post hoc test when appropriate. Withdrawal signs were analyzed by the non-
parametric Mann–Whitney U test. The level of significance was p � 0.05.
Results
Experiment 1: effect of inactivation of CeA neuronal
ensembles in nondependent rats subjected to
intermittent-access 20% ethanol-drinking paradigm
At the end of the continuous access period, the average alcohol
intake was 1.42 � 0.22 mg/kg in 24 h. After intermittent access
and stereotaxic surgery for cannula implantation, the new base-
line for alcohol intake was 2.82 � 0.32 mg/kg in 24 h. The animals
were divided into two groups with comparable levels of escalation
of alcohol intake, as confirmed by the ANOVA, which revealed
no effect of group (F(1,19) � 0.028, p � 0.05), a significant effect of
time (continuous and intermittent periods; F(1,19) � 14.92, p �
0.001), and no group � time interaction (F(1,19) � 0.019, p �
0.05; Fig. 2A). Water intake did not change between the contin-
uous and intermittent phases, as confirmed by the ANOVA,
which revealed no effect of group (F(1,19) � 0.37, p � 0.05) or
time (F(1,19) � 1.58, p � 0.05) and no group � time interaction
(F(1,19) � 0.71, p � 0.05; Fig. 2B).
Local injection of Daun02 significantly affected alcohol in-
take, as confirmed by the overall ANOVA, which revealed no
effect of treatment (F(1,19) � 0.46, p � 0.05), a significant effect of
time (F(5,19) � 14.92, p � 0.01), and a significant treatment �
time interaction (F(5,95) � 2.30, p � 0.05). The Newman–Keuls
post hoc test showed that the Daun02 injection reduced alcohol
intake only on the first day after the injection (p � 0.01; Fig. 2A),
with no effect on days 2, 3, 4, or 5 after injection. Water intake was
unaffected by the injection of Daun02, as confirmed by the
ANOVA, which revealed a significant effect of treatment
(F(1,19) � 0.003, p � 0.05), a significant effect of time (F(5,19) �
3.97, p � 0.01), and no treatment � time interaction (F(5,95) �
2.30, p � 0.05; Fig. 2B).
Because the effect of treatment lasted only 1 d, we reinjected
Daun02 or its vehicle at the end of the experiment, and brains were
collected for the evaluation of Fos � cells in the CeA. Rats that were

 p � 0.001). The Newman–Keuls post hoc test showed that the injec-
tion of Daun02 reduced the number of Fos� neurons in the CeA
(p � 0.05). However, the number of Fos � cells in the treated ani-
mals was still significantly higher compared with naive rats (p �
0.01; Fig. 2D).
Experiment 2: effect of inactivation of CeA neuronal
ensembles in ethanol-dependent rats
At the end of the self-administration training, the number of
reinforced responses for alcohol was 14.82 � 2.17. After vapor
exposure, the animals escalated their level of alcohol intake to an
average of 37.94 � 4.88 responses. The animals were divided into
two groups with comparable levels of escalation of alcohol intake,
as confirmed by the ANOVA, which revealed no effect of group
(F(1,15) � 0.026, p � 0.05), a significant effect of time (prevapor
and postvapor; F(1,15) � 19.51, p � 0.001), and no group � time
interaction (F(1,15) � 0.222, p � 0.05; Fig. 3A). Water self-
administration did not change between the prevapor and postva-
por phases, as confirmed by the ANOVA, which revealed no
effect of group (F(1,15) � 0.54, p � 0.05) or time (F(1,15) � 3.69,
p � 0.05) and no group � time interaction (F(1,15) � 0.048, p �
0.05; Fig. 2B). At this point, the animals were injected with
Daun02 or its vehicle in the CeA. Local injection of Daun02 sig-
nificantly affected alcohol self-administration, as confirmed by
the overall ANOVA, which revealed significant effects of treat-
ment (F(1,15) � 7.59, p � 0.05) and time (F(5,15) � 2.50, p � 0.05)
and a significant treatment � time interaction (F(5,75) � 2.55, p �
0.05). The Newman–Keuls post hoc test showed that the Daun02
injection reduced alcohol intake over the 5 successive sessions
(p � 0.01; Fig. 3A). Water self-administration was unaffected by
the Daun02 injection, as confirmed by the ANOVA, which re-
vealed no effect of treatment (F(1,15) � 0.32, p � 0.05) or time
(F(5,15) � 0.76, p � 0.05) and no treatment � time interaction
(F(5,75) � 0.61, p � 0.05; Fig. 3B).
Immediately before the last alcohol self-administration ses-
sion, the rats were observed for withdrawal signs. As shown in
Figure 3C, the control group exhibited significant increases in
ventromedial limb retraction (Mann–Whitney U � 13.00, p �
0.05), tail rigidity (Mann–Whitney U � 9.000, p � 0.01), vocal-
ization (Mann–Whitney U � 17.00, p � 0.05), and body tremors
(Mann–Whitney U � 18.00, p � 0.05). The sum of the five rating
scores revealed a significant increase in overall withdrawal sever-
ity (Mann–Whitney U � 7.0, p � 0.01; Fig. 3C, inset).
Two days after the last self-administration session, brains were
collected for the evaluation of Fos � cells in the CeA. The ANOVA
revealed a significant increase in Fos � neurons after withdrawal
from alcohol (F(2,20) � 5.731, p � 0.05). The Newman–Keuls post
hoc test showed that alcohol-dependent rats had a higher number of
Fos�neuronscomparedwiththenaivegroup(p�0.05,Daun02vs

Experiment 3: effect of inactivation of CeA neuronal
ensembles on saccharin self-administration in
ethanol-dependent rats
At the end of saccharin self-administration training, the average
number of reinforced responses was 33.3 � 10.19. After vapor
exposure, the animals were divided into two groups that had
comparable levels of saccharin self-administration and injected
with Daun02 or its vehicle. The mixed factorial ANOVA revealed
that saccharin self-administration was unaffected by the injection
of Daun02. The statistical analysis did not indicate any effects of
treatment (F(1,10) � 0.085, p � 0.05) or time (F(5,10) � 0.30, p �
0.05) and no treatment � time interaction (F(5,50) � 0.42, p �
0.05; Fig. 4A). Water intake was also unaffected by the Daun02
injection, as confirmed by the ANOVA, which revealed no effects
of treatment (F(1,10) � 0.213, p � 0.05) or time (F(5,10) � 2.697,
p � 0.05) and no treatment � time interaction (F(5,50) � 1.45,
p � 0.05; Fig. 4B). Immediately before the last saccharin self-
administration session, the rats were observed for withdrawal
signs. As shown in Figure 4C, the control group exhibited signif-
icant increases in ventromedial limb retraction (Mann–Whitney
U � 16.00, p � 0.05), abnormal gait (Mann–Whitney U � 9.00,
p � 0.01), and tail rigidity (Mann–Whitney U � 14.000, p �
0.05). The sum of the five rating scores revealed a significant
increase in overall withdrawal severity (Mann–Whitney U � 8.0,
p � 0.01; Fig. 4C, inset).
Two days after the last self-administration session, brains were
collected for the evaluation of Fos � cells in the CeA. The
ANOVA revealed a significant increase in Fos � neurons after
withdrawal from alcohol (F(2,15) � 5.731, p � 0.01). The New-
man–Keuls post hoc test showed that alcohol-dependent rats had
a higher number of Fos � neurons compared with the naive
group (p � 0.001, Daun02 vs controls; Fig. 4D). This effect was
blocked in animals that were injected with Daun02, in which
the number of Fos � neurons was comparable to naive rats
(p � 0.05).
Discussion
The present study tested the hypothesis that the activation of a
neuronal ensemble in the CeA during abstinence is required for
excessive alcohol drinking in rats. We found that Daun02-
induced inactivation of an abstinence-related neuronal ensemble
in the CeA significantly decreased alcohol drinking in two well
established models of drinking in the rat: 24 h two-bottle choice
and dependence-induced drinking.
In the two-bottle choice paradigm, intermittent access to al-
cohol led to an escalation of alcohol intake that was not observed
in rats with continuous access to alcohol (Simms et al., 2008;
Carnicella et al., 2014). A single intra-CeA infusion of Daun02
significantly decreased alcohol drinking by �61% on the day of
Figure4.

 the infusion (Fig. 2B). The decrease in alcohol drinking was tran-
sient, and rats completely recovered their escalated alcohol drink-
ing during the next day of access to alcohol (with no additional
Daun02 infusion). No differences were observed in water drink-
ing (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that this effect was selective to
alcohol. We also observed a significant decrease (�29%) in Fos �
neurons in the CeA after the Daun02 infusion compared with the
vehicle group (Fig. 2D), confirming the efficacy of Daun02 at the
neuronal level. These results parallel previous studies that re-
ported the overactivation of specific neuronal ensembles in the
CeA during withdrawal (George et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2015).
These data also demonstrate that the recruitment of a neuronal
ensemble in the CeA 24 h into abstinence and immediately before
renewed access to alcohol plays a causal role in alcohol-binge-like
drinking in rats. However, inhibition of this neuronal ensemble
did not permanently decrease excessive alcohol drinking, sug-
gesting that targeting the abstinence-related neuronal ensemble
in the CeA may not be an efficient strategy to reverse excessive
alcohol drinking in nondependent subjects.
To test the causal role of the abstinence-induced neuronal
ensemble in the CeA in alcohol dependence, a second group of
rats was trained to self-administer alcohol and made dependent
by chronic, intermittent exposure to alcohol vapors (Fig. 3A).
Vapor exposure led to a robust escalation of alcohol drinking
when the rats were tested 6–8 h into abstinence (Fig. 3Ba), which
is known to reverse both somatic and motivational withdrawal
and result in compulsive-like alcohol seeking (Roberts et al.,
2000; Vendruscolo et al., 2012). A single infusion of Daun02 6 h
into abstinence produced a complete normalization of alcohol
drinking that lasted at least 2 weeks (Fig. 3B) and did not affect
water self-administration (Fig. 3Bb). Moreover, inactivation of
the abstinence-related neuronal ensemble in the CeA was associ-
ated with a robust decrease in the severity of somatic signs of
alcohol withdrawal (Fig. 3C) despite the fact that the rats were
still being exposed to alcohol vapor and reached high blood alco-
hol levels. Abstinence from alcohol vapor produced a significant
recruitment of Fos � neurons in the CeA and Daun02 infusion in
the CeA completely prevented this activation (Fig. 3D). These
results demonstrate that the recruitment of a neuronal ensemble
in the CeA during abstinence from alcohol is required for exces-
sive alcohol drinking that is observed in alcohol-dependent rats
and that alcohol drinking in rats in a binge-like model is partially
controlled by this same neuronal ensemble.
To test the behavioral specificity of inactivation of this CeA
dependence neuronal ensemble, the same experiment was re-
peated in alcohol-dependent animals that self-administered sac-
charin (Fig. 4A). Daun02 infusion 6 h into abstinence from
alcohol vapor did not alter saccharin or water self-administration
(Fig. 4B) despite the decrease in the severity of somatic signs of
alcohol withdrawal (Fig. 4C) and the robust inhibition of
Fos � neurons in the CeA, similar to what was observed in the
previous experiment (Fig. 4D). These results demonstrate that an
abstinence-related neuronal ensemble is recruited in the CeA af-
ter chronic high-dose alcohol, which controls escalated alcohol
intake and the expression of somatic signs of alcohol withdrawal
without affecting self-administration of a natural reinforcer (i.e.,
saccharin-sweetened water).
Studies on neuronal ensembles of memory, fear, and addic-
tion have largely focused on the neuronal ensembles that are
recruited by cues and contexts and not by an internal state such as
abstinence or withdrawal. Indeed, using the Daun02 inactivation
method, several groups of investigators have identified neuronal
ensembles in the nucleus accumbens that are involved in the
context-induced sensitization of cocaine-induced locomotion
(Mattson et al., 2008) and in the context-induced reinstatement
of cocaine seeking (Cruz et al., 2014). A causal role for such
neuronal ensembles was also demonstrated in the medial pre-
frontal cortex for the context-induced reinstatement of heroin
seeking (Bossert et al., 2011) and in the orbitofrontal cortex for
the incubation of heroin craving (Fanous et al., 2012). Pfarr et al.
(2015) recently identified a neuronal ensemble in the infralimbic
cortex that inhibits the cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol
seeking. The present study uniquely characterized a neuronal
ensemble that is not recruited by a cue or context, but rather by an
internal state (i.e., alcohol withdrawal).
The present study demonstrates that a long-lasting reversal of
the behavioral and neuronal effects of alcohol dependence can be
obtained by specifically targeting an abstinence-related neuronal
ensemble in the CeA in dependent rats. Such complete and long-
lasting reversal of dependence-induced drinking and somatic
signs of withdrawal is usually reported with the chronic admin-
istration of pharmacological compounds (Steensland et al., 2007;
Czachowski and Delory, 2009; Ciccocioppo et al., 2014). Indeed,
the present results can be argued to parallel the elegant work by
Naqvi et al. (2007) that was performed in humans, demonstrating
a complete reversal of nicotine dependence (both somatic and
motivational) after brain damage to the insula, in which patients
stated that their “body forgot the urge to smoke.” We hypothesize
that a similar mechanism may be engaged here and that the
abstinence-related neuronal ensemble in the CeA may be re-
quired for encoding the negative reinforcement that drives com-
pulsive alcohol drinking. This is particularly compelling when
considering the prominent connections between the insula and
CeA (McDonald et al., 1999) and considering that the CeA plays
a key role in the aversive symptoms associated with alcohol
withdrawal.
In summary, the present study demonstrates that the recruit-
ment of a neuronal ensemble in the CeA during abstinence from
alcohol is causally related to excessive alcohol drinking in
alcohol-dependent rats, whereas a similar neuronal ensemble
only partially contributes to alcohol-binge-like drinking in non-
dependent rats. These results identify a critical neurobiological
mechanism that is required for alcohol dependence, suggesting
that targeting dependence neuronal ensembles may lead to a bet-
ter understanding of the etiology of alcohol use disorders, with
implications for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.
