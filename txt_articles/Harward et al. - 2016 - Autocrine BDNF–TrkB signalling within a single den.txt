Abstract
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB are crucial for many forms of 
neuronal plasticity1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, including structural long-term potentiation (sLTP)7, 8, which is a 
correlate of an animal’s learning7, 9, 10, 11, 12. However, it is unknown whether BDNF release and 
TrkB activation occur during sLTP, and if so, when and where. Here, using a fluorescence 
resonance energy transfer-based sensor for TrkB and two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging 
microscopy13, 14, 15, 16, we monitor TrkB activity in single dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal 
neurons in cultured murine hippocampal slices. In response to sLTP induction9, 14, 15, 16, we find 
fast (onset < 1 min) and sustained (>20 min) activation of TrkB in the stimulated spine that 
depends on NMDAR (N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor) and CaMKII signalling and on 
postsynaptically synthesized BDNF. We confirm the presence of postsynaptic BDNF using 
electron microscopy to localize endogenous BDNF to dendrites and spines of hippocampal CA1 
pyramidal neurons. Consistent with these findings, we also show rapid, glutamate-uncaging-
evoked, time-locked BDNF release from single dendritic spines using BDNF fused to superecliptic 
pHluorin17, 18, 19. We demonstrate that this postsynaptic BDNF–TrkB signalling pathway is 
necessary for both structural and functional LTP20. Together, these findings reveal a spine-
autonomous, autocrine signalling mechanism involving NMDAR–CaMKII-dependent BDNF

 release from stimulated dendritic spines and subsequent TrkB activation on these same spines that 
is crucial for structural and functional plasticity.
To address the role of BDNF–TrkB signalling in sLTP, we developed a fluorescence 
resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensor for TrkB consisting of two components: (1) 
TrkB fused to monomeric enhanced green fluorescent protein (TrkB–eGFP), and (2) an SH2 
domain of the TrkB binding partner phospholipase Cγ1 (PLC-γ1)21 fused to two copies of 
monomeric red fluorescent protein-1 (mRFP1–PLC–mRFP1; Fig. 1a and Supplementary 
Information). After TrkB activation via phosphorylation of Tyr816, the affinity of mRFP1–
PLC–mRFP1 for TrkB–eGFP increases21, thereby allowing FRET to occur between the 
fluorophores (Supplementary Information). We validated the sensor in HeLa cells and 
cultured cortical neurons by showing it to be sensitive to BDNF, specific for 
Tyr816phosphorylation, and reversible when imaged by two-photon fluorescence lifetime 
imaging microscopy (2pFLIM) (Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Information). 
Furthermore, we demonstrated that the sensor could functionally replace endogenous TrkB 
in neurons of cultured hippocampal slices (Extended Data Fig. 2, Supplementary 
Information).
Using this sensor, we biolistically transfected cultured rat hippocampal slices and imaged 
CA1 pyramidal neurons with 2pFLIM. In response to glutamate uncaging targeted to a 
single dendritic spine (30 pulses at 0.5 Hz), spine volume rapidly increased by ~220% 
(transient phase) before relaxing to an increased state of ~90% lasting at least 60 min 
(sustained phase; Fig. 1b, c, Extended Data Fig. 3a)—changes independent of protein 
synthesis (Extended Data Fig. 3c, d) and largely consistent with previous descriptions of 
sLTP (Extended Data Fig. 3a, Supplementary Information)9, 14, 15, 16. At the same time, 
TrkB rapidly activated in the stimulated spine, peaking at ~1–2 min and remaining elevated 
for at least 60 min (Fig. 1b, d, e, Extended Data Figs 3b, 4 and Supplementary Information). 
For the first 30–60 s after the onset of glutamate uncaging, this activation was largely 
restricted to the stimulated spine (Fig. 1d–f, Supplementary Information). However, with 
time, TrkB activation in adjacent regions slowly increased, suggesting spreading of TrkB 
activation (Fig. 1d–f). The validity of the observed signal was confirmed by its dependence 
on kinase activity and Tyr816 phosphorylation and independence of sensor concentration 
and temperature (Extended Data Figs 5, 6, 7, Supplementary Information).
To explore mechanisms underlying this TrkB activation, we asked whether it required 
NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ influx7, 9, 15, 16 and subsequent CaMKII activation9, 15. Application 
of either the NMDAR inhibitor d-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (d-AP5; 100 μM) or the 
CaMKII inhibitor CN21 (ref. 22; 10 μM) impaired TrkB activation during the transient and 
sustained phases of sLTP while also inhibiting spine volume change (Fig. 2a–d), suggesting 
that TrkB is in part downstream of both NMDAR and CaMKII activation.
Next, we asked whether BDNF contributes to this TrkB activation. Using the extracellular 
BDNF scavenger TrkB-Ig (6–8 μg ml−1), we found impaired TrkB activation throughout 
sLTP with a similar impairment of spine volume change (Fig. 2e–h), suggesting a crucial 
role for BDNF in mediating glutamate-uncaging-induced TrkB activation. To examine the 
cellular source of BDNF underlying this activation, we sparsely transfected the sensor with

 Cre recombinase in slices from Bdnffl/fl mice, thereby selectively knocking-out BDNF 
synthesized in the postsynaptic cell, a perturbation without detectable effect on basal spine 
morphology23, 40, 41 (Extended Data Fig. 8a, b). This manipulation attenuated glutamate-
uncaging-evoked TrkB activation and sLTP (Fig. 2i–l) while leaving CaMKII activation 
intact (Extended Data Fig. 8c–f). These results implicate autocrine BDNF as one mechanism 
underlying TrkB activation during sLTP: additional mechanisms could include other sources 
of BDNF (pre-synaptic, paracrine) or non-neurotrophin TrkB activators (such as zinc)24.
The dependence of glutamate-uncaging-induced TrkB activation on postsynaptically 
synthesized BDNF controversially suggests the existence of BDNF in dendrites or spines25. 
To provide more direct evidence, we used electron microscopy to examine BDNF 
localization in a previously characterized mouse line in which a C-terminal haemagglutinin 
(HA) epitope tag was added to the Bdnf coding sequence (Bdnf-HA)26. Using highly 
sensitive antibodies against the HA-tag, we found BDNF not only in axons but also in 
dendrites and spines of CA1 pyramidal cells of these mice (Fig. 3).
The localization of BDNF to dendritic spines, together with the rapid kinetics and initial 
spine restriction of glutamate-uncaging-induced TrkB activation, suggested an equally rapid 
release of BDNF from dendritic spines during the transient phase of sLTP. To assess this 
possibility, we used biolistics to transfect CA1 pyramidal cells with full-length BDNF 
containing the pH-sensitive fluorophore superecliptic pHluorin (SEP) fused to its C 
terminus, thus allowing visualization of exocytosed BDNF18, 19 (Extended Data Fig. 9a, 
Supplementary Information). In response to glutamate uncaging, we observed an increase in 
SEP fluorescence largely restricted to the stimulated spine (Fig. 4a, b, Supplementary Video 
1), with two distinct kinetic profiles. The first was a transient, spike-like increase time-
locked to each uncaging pulse (Fig. 4a–c), perhaps correlating with activity-induced BDNF 
release. The second was a slow increase in fluorescence commencing with the start of 
uncaging and peaking at its end, perhaps due to extracellular accumulation of released 
BDNF–SEP (Fig. 4a, b). After termination of uncaging, SEP fluorescence decayed back to 
baseline over the course of 10 min (Extended Data Fig. 9e).
Several lines of evidence suggested that these transient, spike-like increases in SEP 
fluorescence were in fact due to BDNF release from the spine. First, the observed 
fluorescence signal depended on pH, exocytosis, and BDNF sorting machinery27 (Fig. 4c, d, 
Extended Data Fig. 9d, Supplementary Information). Second, expression of BDNF–SEP 
rescued structural plasticity in the setting of postsynaptic BDNF knockout, thus suggesting 
that it could functionally replace endogenous BDNF in neurons (Fig. 4e, f, Supplementary 
Information). Third, the observed BDNF–SEP signal was independent of the presence of 
endogenous postsynaptic BDNF (Fig. 4g, h). Fourth, the kinetic profile of the signal 
paralleled the time course of TrkB activation, as one would expect for BDNF release 
(Extended Data Fig. 4). Collectively, these results suggest that the observed increase in SEP 
signal probably reports glutamate-dependent exocytosis and release of BDNF from 
stimulated spines.
To explore mechanisms underlying glutamate-induced BDNF release, we inhibited 
NMDARs (with AP5) or AMPARs (with NBQX) individually and together as well as

 inhibiting CaMKII with CN21 (Fig. 4c, d). We found the SEP signal to be largely blocked 
(AP5), unaffected (NBQX), completely blocked (AP5 plus NBQX), and partially blocked 
(CN21) by these perturbations (Fig. 4c, d). These findings suggest that BDNF release from 
spines is largely NMDAR–CaMKII dependent, consistent with our results for TrkB 
activation.
The converging evidence implicating autocrine BDNF–TrkB signalling in sLTP led us to ask 
whether this pathway was also involved in functional LTP (fLTP) at the CA3–CA1 synapse. 
To address this question, we induced fLTP by pairing low-frequency Schaffer collateral axon 
stimulation with depolarization of single CA1 pyramidal cells through whole-cell patch 
clamping. First, we examined the role of TrkB by using knock-in mice containing a point 
mutation in the TrkB kinase domain (F616A; TrkbF616A, also known as Ntrk2F616A), 
rendering the mutant TrkB uniquely susceptible to inhibition by the small molecule 
1NMPP1 (ref. 28). 1NMPP1 inhibited both sLTP (in cultured slices) and fLTP (in acute 
slices) in slices isolated from TrkbF616A but not wild-type mice, revealing a requirement for 
TrkB kinase (Fig. 5a–d). In addition, scavenging extracellular BDNF with TrkB-Ig (2 μg 
ml−1) impaired both sLTP (in cultured slices) and fLTP (in acute slices) (Extended Data Fig. 
10a–d), implicating BDNF as one mechanism underlying TrkB activation in this context.
To determine whether autocrine BDNF–TrkB signalling in particular contributed to these 
forms of plasticity, we knocked out BDNF in a small population of CA1 pyramidal cells 
using either in utero infection of adeno-associated virus encoding synapsin-Cre in Bdnffl/fl 
mice for fLTP in acute slices or biolistic transfection of Cre in organotypic slices prepared 
from Bdnffl/fl mice for sLTP. The knockout of postsynaptic BDNF impaired both fLTP and 
sLTP, the latter of which was rescued by bath-applied BDNF (20 ng ml−1 for 10 min) (Fig. 
5e–h). Collectively, these results reveal a requirement of a cell-autonomous, postsynaptic 
BDNF release and subsequent activation of postsynaptic TrkB for both structural and 
functional synaptic plasticity (Extended Data Fig. 10e, Supplementary Information).
Overall, we have described an autocrine signalling system within a single spine achieved by 
rapid BDNF release from the stimulated spine and subsequent TrkB activation on the same 
spine that, potentially in cooperation with other sources of BDNF and activators of TrkB, is 
essential for both structural and functional plasticity.

 Plasmids
TrkB–eGFP was prepared by inserting the coding sequence of mouse TrkB (obtained from a 
previously described plasmid29) into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) containing the A206K 
monomeric mutation in eGFP and the CAG promoter30. The linker between TrkB and eGFP 
is TGRH. mRFP1–PLC–mRFP1 was prepared by inserting the coding sequence for the C-
terminal SH2 domain of human PLC-γ1 (659–769; obtained from full-length, human PLC-
γ1 purchased from Origene) into a tandem-mRFP1 plasmid containing the CAG promoter. 
The linkers between the mRFP1s and PLC-γ1 (659–769) are RSRAQASNS for the N 
terminus and GSG for the C terminus. TrkBY816F–eGFP was prepared by introducing a 
point mutation using the Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Tandem mCherry 
(mCh–mCh) was generated as previously described16. HA–BDNF–Flag was a gift from A. 
West. The coding sequence for SEP (obtained from SEP-GluA1; ref. 31) was incorporated 
onto the 3′ end of HA–BDNF–Flag to generate HA–BDNF–Flag-SEP. HA–BDNF–Flag–
mRFP1 was generated in a similar fashion. A plasmid containing mCh-IRES-TeTX was a 
gift from M. Ehlers. POMC-mCh was generated by amplifying the POMC peptide 
(MWCLESSQCQDLTTESNLLACIRACRLDL)27 using overhang PCR with a C-terminal 
linker (GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGMADQLTEEWHRGTAGPGS). This 
amplicon was then inserted into the tandem mCh plasmid by replacing the coding sequence 
of the first mCh.
Animals
All animal procedures were approved by the Duke University School of Medicine Animal 
Care and Use Committee, Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience, and Weill Cornell 
Medical College Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees and were conducted in 
accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
We used both male and female rats and mice. Rats and C57/B6 mice were obtained from 
Charles River, TrkbF616A mutant mice were provided by D. Ginty28, Bdnffl/fl and Trkbfl/fl 
mice were provided by L. Parada32, and Bdnf-HA mice were generated as previously 
described26. The genotype of each animal used was verified before and after preparing slices 
using PCR of genomic DNA isolated from tail DNA before and slice samples after.
Preparation of HeLa cells
HeLa cells were obtained from the Duke University Cell Culture Facility. These cells had 
been authenticated using short-tandem repeat profiling and evaluated for mycoplasma 
contamination. Cells were cultured and maintained as previously described16. Cells were 
transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 using the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). 
Concentrations used were 0.5 μl ml−1 Lipofectamine and 1 μg ml−1 total cDNA (1:1 ratio of 
TrkB–eGFP to mRFP1–PLC–mRFP1 DNA). Then, 24–48 h later, culture media was 
replaced with HEPES-buffered ACSF for imaging (HACSF; 20 mM HEPES, 130 mM NaCl, 
2 mM NaHCO3, 25 mM d-glucose, 2.5 mM KCl and 1.25 mM NaH2PO4; adjusted to pH 7.4 
and 310 mOsm). After a 30-min equilibration period, transfected cells were imaged using 
2pFLIM as described below. Cell stimulation was performed by directly adding BDNF or 
vehicle to the HACSF bathing the cells.

 Preparation of mixed cortical cultures
Mixed cortical cultures were prepared as described previously33 and transfected with 
Lipofectamine 2000 using a modified protocol. For transfection of neurons in 3.5 cm dishes, 
1 μl Lipofectamine was mixed with 1 μg of plasmid DNA (1 μg per construct transfected) in 
100 μl of culture media for 20 min. Culture media was removed from the 3.5 cm dish until 
only 1 ml remained. The Lipofectamine/DNA solution was added to the neurons for 45 min. 
At this point, all the media was removed and replaced with 2 ml conditioned culture media. 
After 24–48 h, culture media was replaced with HACSF. To stimulate cells, we added BDNF 
or NGF directly to the HACSF bathing the cells. 30 min after stimulation, we added K252a 
to the HACSF.
Preparation of organotypic hippocampal slices
Cultured hippocampal slices were prepared from post-natal day 5–7 rats or mice, as 
previously described34, in accordance with the animal care and use guidelines of Duke 
University Medical Center. After 5–12 days in culture, CA1 pyramidal neurons were 
transfected with biolistic gene transfer using gold beads (12 mg; Biorad) coated with 
plasmids containing 20–40 μg of total cDNA (TrkB sensor: 15 μg TrkB–eGFP and 15 μg 
mRFP1–PLC–mRFP1; TrkB sensor plus mCh: 5 μg TrkB–eGFP, 5 μg mRFP1–PLC–
mRFP1, and 20 μg mCh–mCh; TrkB sensor plus mCh and Cre: 5 μg TrkB–GFP, 5 μg 
mRFP1–PLC–mRFP1, 5 μg tdTom-Cre, and 15 μg mCh–mCh; BDNF–SEP plus mCh: 20 μg 
BDNF–SEP and 10 μg mCh–mCh; BDNF–SEP plus TeTX: 20 μg BDNF–SEP and 10 μg 
mCh-IRES-TeTX; BDNF–SEP plus POMC: 20 μg BDNF–SEP and 10 μg POMC–mCh; 
eGFP: 20 μg eGFP; and eGFP plus Cre: 10 μg eGFP plus 10 μg tdTom-Cre). Neurons 
expressing the TrkB sensor were imaged 12–48 h after transfection. Neurons expressing the 
TrkB sensor with mCh or mCh plus Cre were imaged 5–7 days after transfection. The 
addition of the mCh proved critical in limiting the TrkB sensor expression thereby allowing 
neurons to survive longer with the sensor present. Neurons expressing only eGFP were 
imaged 1–7 days after transfection. Neurons expressing eGFP plus Cre were imaged 5–9 
days after transfection.
2pFLIM
FRET imaging using a custom-built two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope 
was performed as previously described13, 35. Two-photon imaging was performed using a 
Ti-sapphire laser (MaiTai, Spectraphysics) tuned to a wavelength of 920 nm, allowing 
simultaneous excitation of eGFP, mRFP1 and mCh. All samples were imaged using <2 mW 
laser power measured at the objective. Fluorescence emission was collected using an 
immersion objective (60×, numerical aperture 0.9, Olympus), divided with a dichroic mirror 
(565 nm), and detected with two separate photoelectron multiplier tubes (PMTs) placed 
downstream of two wavelength filters (Chroma, HQ510-2p to select for green and 
HQ620/90-2p to select for red). The green channel was fitted with a PMT having a low 
transfer time spread (H7422-40p; Hamamatsu) to allow for fluorescence lifetime imaging, 
while the red channel was fitted with a wide-aperture PMT (R3896; Hamamatsu). Photon 
counting for fluorescence lifetime imaging was performed using a time-correlated single 
photon counting board (SPC-150; Becker and Hickl) controlled with custom software13,

 while the red channel signal was acquired using a separate data acquisition board 
(PCI-6110) controlled with Scanimage software36.
Two-photon glutamate uncaging
A second Ti-sapphire laser tuned at a wavelength of 720 nm was used to uncage 4-
methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl-caged-l-glutamate (MNI-caged glutamate) in extracellular solution 
with a train of 4–6 ms, 4–5 mW pulses (30 times at 0.5 Hz) near a spine of interest. 
Experiments were performed in Mg2+ free artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF; 127 mM 
NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 4 mM CaCl2, 25 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4 and 25 mM 
glucose) containing 1 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX) and 4 mM MNI-caged l-glutamate aerated 
with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Experiments were performed at 24–26 °C (room temperature) or 
30–32 °C using a heating block holding the ACSF container. Temperature measurements 
were made from ACSF within the perfusion chamber holding the slice.
2pFLIM data analyses
To measure the fraction of donor bound to acceptor, we fit a fluorescence lifetime curve 
summing all pixels over a whole image with a double exponential function convolved with 
the Gaussian pulse response function:
in which τAD is the fluorescence lifetime of donor bound with acceptor, PD and PAD are the 
fraction of free donor and donor bound with acceptor, respectively, and H(t) is a 
fluorescence lifetime curve with a single exponential function convolved with the Gaussian 
pulse response function:
in which τD is the fluorescence lifetime of the free donor, τG is the width of the Guassian 
pulse response function, F0 is the peak fluorescence before convolution and t0 is the time 
offset, and erfc is the error function.
We fixed τD to the fluorescence lifetime obtained from free mEGFP (2.6 ns). To generate the 
fluorescence lifetime image, we calculated the mean photon arrival time, 〈t〉, in each pixel 
as:
then, the mean photon arrival time is related to the mean fluorescence lifetime, 〈τ〉, by an 
offset arrival time, t0, which is obtained by fitting the whole image:

 For small regions-of-interest (ROIs) in an image (spines or dendrites), we calculated the 
binding fraction (PAD) as:
BDNF–SEP and BDNF–mRFP1 imaging
BDNF–SEP imaging was performed by interleaving 8 Hz two-photon imaging with two-
photon glutamate uncaging (30 pulses at 0.5 Hz). Multiple (1–30) spines were imaged on 
each neuron. Change in BDNF–SEP fluorescence was measured as ΔF/F0 after subtracting 
background fluorescence. Uncaging-triggered averages were calculated as the average 
increase in SEP fluorescence after each individual uncaging pulse. Red fluorescence 
increase was smoothed using a 16-frame window.
For visualizing BDNF–mRFP1 localization in CA1 pyramidal neurons, images were 
obtained using a Leica SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica).
Spine volume analysis
During 2pFLIM and BDNF–SEP imaging (Figs 2, 3), spine volume was reported using the 
red fluorescent intensity from mRFP1 or mCh. For two-photon imaging without FLIM (Fig. 
4), green fluorescent intensity from eGFP was used. In all experiments, spine volume was 
measured as the integrated fluorescent intensity after subtracting background (F). Spine 
volume change was calculated by F/F0, in which F0 is the average spine volume before 
stimulation. Additionally, to compare basal spine size/morphology between various 
conditions, maximal spine (Fmax(spine)) and dendrite (Fmax(dendrite)) fluorescent intensities 
were measured and the Fmax(spine)/Fmax(dendrite) ratio was calculated after subtracting 
background fluorescence.
In utero viral injection for single-cell BDNF knockout
E14.5/15.5 timed-pregnant Bdnffl/fl mice were deeply anaesthetized using an isoflurane–
oxygen mixture. The uterine horns were exposed and approximately 1–2 μl of AAV solution 
mix (containing AAV1.CAG.EGFP, AAV1.CAG.Flex.tdTomato and AAV1.hSyn.Cre, all 
from U Penn vector core) was injected through a pulled-glass capillary tube into the right 
lateral ventricle of each embryo. To achieve sufficient labelling of eGFP CA1 neurons 
alongside sparse expression of Cre + BDNF knockout tdTomato neurons, eGFP and Flex-
tdTomato viruses were used at concentration of ~1012 viral genome copies per μl, and Cre 
was diluted (~100-fold) in PBS at a dilution determined to achieve a sparse labelling density 
of Cre-positive CA1 neurons.
Functional LTP
LTP experiments in Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 10 were performed in Max Planck Florida 
Institute (MPFI) and Duke University, respectively. Mice (wild type, TrkbF616A, or Bdnffl/fl 
age 21–42 days) were sedated by isoflurane inhalation, and the brain was removed and 
dissected in a chilled cutting solution (124 mM choline chloride, 2.5 mM KCl, 26 mM 
NaHCO3, 3.3 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM d-glucose and 0.5 mM CaCl2: MPFI

 or 110 mM sucrose, 60 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 28 mM NaHCO3, 0.5 
mM CaCl2, 7.0 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM d-glucose. The solutions were saturated with 95% O2 
plus 5% CO2, pH 7.4)37. Coronal slices (250 μm: MPFI) or transverse hippocampal slices 
(400 μm: Duke) were prepared and maintained in oxygenated ACSF (MPFI/Duke: 127/124 
mM NaCl, 2.5/1.75 mM KCl, 10/11 mM d-glucose, 26/25 mM NaHCO3, 1.25/0 mM 
NaH2PO4, 0/1.25 mM KH2PO4, 1.3/2.0 MgCl2 and 2.4/2.0 CaCl2,) in a submerged chamber 
at 32–34 °C for at least 1 h before use.
Electrophysiological recordings were performed in ACSF (plus picrotoxin at MPFI). CA1 
pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices from wild-type and TrkbF616A mice were 
visualized using oblique illumination or differential interference contrast (DIC). For Bdnffl/fl 
experiments, Cre-negative (eGFP-expressing) and Cre-positive (tdTomato-expressing) 
neurons were identified and targeted with fluorescence microscopy. Patch pipettes (3–6 MΩ) 
were filled with an internal solution (130 mM K gluconate, 10 mM, Na phosphocreatine 4 
mM MgCl2,4 mM NaATP, 0.3 mM MgGTP, 3 mM l-ascorbic acid and 10 mM HEPES, pH 
7.4, and 310 mOsm at MPFI or K-gluconate 140 mM, HEPES 10 mM, EGTA 1 mM, NaCl 4 
mM, Mg2ATP 4 mM, and Mg2GTP 0.3 mM, pH 7.25, and 290 mOsm at Duke). Series 
resistances (10–40 MΩ) and input resistances (100–300 MΩ) were monitored throughout the 
experiment using negative voltage steps. The membrane potential was held at −70 mV. 
Experiments were performed at room temperature (~21 °C) and slices were perfused with 
oxygenated ACSF. For TrkbF616A/wild-type experiments, 1NMMP1 or vehicle was added to 
the ACSF before stimulation. For TrkB-Ig experiments, slices were incubated in 2 μg ml−1 
TrkB-Ig or control human IgG for at least 2 h before the experiments. EPSCs were evoked 
by extracellular stimulation of Schaffer collaterals using a concentric bipolar stimulating 
electrode (World Precision Instruments) at a rate of 0.03 Hz. LTP was induced by pairing a 
2-Hz stimulation with a postsynaptic depolarization to 0 mV for 15 s (MPFI) or 75 s (Duke). 
EPSC potentiation was assessed for 30–45 min (for TrkbF616A experiments), 40–60 min (for 
Bdnffl/fl experiments) or 20–30 min (for TrkB-Ig experiments) after stimulation.
Immunoprecipitation
HeLa cells were transfected with the TrkB sensor (TrkB–eGFP and mRFP1–PLC–mRFP1) 
using Lipofectamine 2000 as described above. Then, 24–48 h after transfection, the media 
bathing the cells was exchanged for HEPES buffered ACSF for biochemistry (150 mM 
NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.35, 20 mM glucose, and 310 mOsM). After a 30-
min equilibration period, cells were stimulated with 100 ng ml−1 BDNF for 10 min. 
Following stimulation, cells were washed in ice-cold PBS (Gibco), and then lysed in 
modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium 
deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors) for 10 
min on ice. The supernatant was collected after a 10 min centrifugation at 16,000g at 4 °C. 
At this point, a small volume of the supernatant was added to SDS-sample buffer and saved 
as the ‘cell lysate’ sample. The remaining supernatant was pre-cleared using protein G 
Sepharose beads (25 μl, Roche) for 30 min at 4 °C. After pre-clearing, the supernatant was 
incubated with 20 μg mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (BD Transduction Labs) at 
4 °C overnight. The immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein G Sepharose beads 
(50 μl) for 3 h at 4 °C and then analysed with western blotting. Antibodies used in western

 blotting included TrkB (Millipore), GFP (Abcam), actin (Sigma), and pTrkB(Y515) 
(Sigma).
Electron microscopic immunohistochemistry
Male adult (~2–3 months old) Bdnf-HA knock-in mice26 and aged matched wild-type 
C57/BL mice were used. The same investigator (T.A.M.) perfused all mice (Bdnf-HA and 
wild type) to maintain consistency between groups. Mice (3 per group) were deeply 
anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (150 mg kg−1, i.p.) and perfused sequentially 
through the ascending aorta with: (1) ~5 ml saline (0.9%) containing 2% heparin, and (2) 30 
ml of 3.75% acrolein and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB; pH 7.4)38. 
Following removal from the skull, the brain was post-fixed for in 2% acrolein and 2% 
paraformaldehyde in PB 30 min. Brains were then sectioned (40 μm thick) on a Vibratome 
and stored at −20 °C in cryoprotectant until use.
For each animal, two dorsal hippocampal sections were processed for immunoelectron 
microscopy (immunoEM) experiments using previously described methods38. Before 
immunohistochemical processing, sections were rinsed in PB, and experimental groups were 
coded with hole-punches so that tissue could be run in single crucibles, ensuring identical 
exposure to all reagents.
Before processing for immunolabelling, sections were treated with 1% sodium borohydride 
for 30 min to remove free aldehyde sites. Sections then were rinsed in PB followed by a 
rinse in 0.1 M Tris-saline (TS; pH 7.6) and then a 30 min incubation in 0.5% BSA in TS. 
Sections then were incubated in primary rabbit anti-HA (1:1,000; Sigma) in 0.025% Triton-
X 100 and 0.1% BSA in TS for 1 day at room temperature and 4 days at 4 °C. Sections then 
were incubated in donkey anti-rabbit biotinylated IgG (1:400; Jackson Immunoresearch 
Laboratories) for 30 min followed by a 30 min incubation in avidin-biotin complex (ABC; 
Vectastain Elite Kit, Vector Laboratories) in TS (1:100 dilution). Sections were developed in 
3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich) and H2O2 in TS. All antibody incubations were 
performed in 0.1% BSA/TS and separated by washes in TS.
Sections were post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide for 1 h, dehydrated, and flat embedded in 
Embed-812 (EMS) between two sheets of Aclar plastic. Brain sections containing the CA1 
and dentate gyrus were selected from the plastic embedded sections, glued onto Epon blocks 
and trimmed to 1 mm-wide trapezoids. Ultra-thin sections (70 nm thickness) through the 
tissue-plastic interface were cut with a diamond knife (EMS) on a Leica EM UC6 ultratome, 
and sections were collected on 400-mesh, thin-bar copper grids (EMS). Grids were then 
counterstained with uranyl acetate and Reynold’s lead citrate.
Ultrastructural analysis
An investigator blinded to animal condition performed the data collection and analysis. One 
section from each of Bdnf-HA and wild-type animals was analysed (n = 3 each group). The 
thin sections were examined and photographed on a Tecnai Biotwin transmission electron 
microscope (FEI). Cell profiles were identified by defined morphological criteria39. 
Dendritic profiles generally were postsynaptic to axon terminals and contained regular 
microtubule arrays. Dendritic spines also were usually postsynaptic to axon terminal profiles

 and sometimes contained a spine apparatus. Axon terminals contained small synaptic 
vesicles and occasional dense-core vesicles. Unmyelinated axons were profiles smaller than 
0.15 μm that contained a few small synaptic vesicles and lacked a synaptic junction in the 
plane of section. Glial profiles were distinguished by the presence of glial filaments 
(astrocytic profiles), by the presence of microtubules and/or their tendency to conform 
irregularly to the boundaries of surrounding profiles. ‘Unknown profiles’ were those that 
contained immunoperoxidase reaction product but could not be definitively placed in one of 
the above categories.
From each block, 4 grid squares (each square was 55 × 55 μm2) each from the CA1 near 
stratum radiatum (nSR in Fig. 3; that is, adjacent to the pyramidal cell layer) and distal 
stratum radiatum (dSR in Fig. 3; that is, 50–150 μm away from the pyramidal cell layer) 
were randomly sampled for analysis. Thus, 12,100 μm2 was sampled for each area in each 
block. Grid squares were selected plastic-tissue interface to ensure even antibody tissue 
penetration38. Immunoperoxidase labelling for HA was evident as a characteristic, electron-
dense DAB reaction product precipitate. All peroxidase labelled profiles from each square 
were photographed and categorized. Animal codes were not broken until all 6 blocks were 
analysed.
Statistical analysis
Sample sizes for all experiments were chosen based on signal-to-noise ratios identified in 
pilot experiments. Variances of all data sets were estimated and compared using Bartlett’s or 
Levene’s test before further statistical analysis. Randomization of animals and/or slices was 
not needed.
To evaluate distribution patterns of TrkB sensor activity, spine volume change, and BDNF–
SEP signal, peak responses for each data set (the same points used for statistical 
comparisons) were subjected to a Shapiro–Wilk test for normality. TrkB sensor activity 
adhered to the null hypothesis (normal distribution) while spine volume change and BDNF–
SEP signal did not.
Because TrkB sensor activity had a normal distribution, parametric statistics were used: 
paired and unpaired two-tailed t-test, ANOVA, and repeated-measures ANOVA with 
appropriate post-hoc analysis, as indicated in the figure legends and supplementary note. For 
t-tests, homoscedasticity between groups was evaluated using the F-test. If variance was 
unequal, Welch’s corrected t-test was performed. For ANOVA, homoscedasticity was 
evaluated with Bartlett’s test. For multiple comparisons of sensor activity, data were 
subjected to ANOVA or repeated-measures ANOVA followed by a post-hoc test to 
determine statistical significance. In cases where each condition was compared to all other 
conditions in the experiment, the Tukey–Kramer method was employed. In cases where each 
condition was compared to a single control, Dunnet’s test was used.
Since spine volume change had a non-normal distribution, data were log-transformed to 
resolve skewness and then analysed with parametric statistics (the same tests described 
above), as indicated in the figure legends.

 For the BDNF–SEP signal, log-transformation of the data did not resolve the skewness. As 
such, non-parametric statistics were used—Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Kruskal–Wallis test 
with followed by a Dunn’s test.
Data were only excluded if obvious signs of poor cellular health (dendritic blebbing, spine 
collapse, etc.) were apparent.
