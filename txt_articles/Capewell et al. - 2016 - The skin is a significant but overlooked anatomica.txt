Abstract The role of mammalian skin in harbouring and transmitting arthropod-borne protozoan
parasites has been overlooked for decades as these pathogens have been regarded primarily as
blood-dwelling organisms. Intriguingly, infections with low or undetected blood parasites are
common, particularly in the case of Human African Trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei
gambiense. We hypothesise, therefore, the skin represents an anatomic reservoir of infection. Here
we definitively show that substantial quantities of trypanosomes exist within the skin following
experimental infection, which can be transmitted to the tsetse vector, even in the absence of
detectable parasitaemia. Importantly, we demonstrate the presence of extravascular parasites in
human skin biopsies from undiagnosed individuals. The identification of this novel reservoir
requires a re-evaluation of current diagnostic methods and control policies. More broadly, our
results indicate that transmission is a key evolutionary force driving parasite extravasation that
could further result in tissue invasion-dependent pathology.

SHORT REPORT
 Introduction
Understanding the process of parasite transmission is essential for the design of rational control
measures to break the disease cycle and requires the identification of all reservoirs of infection. In a
number of vector-borne diseases, it is becoming evident that asymptomatic individuals, be they
humans or animals, can represent a significant proportion of the infected population and therefore
an important reservoir of disease that requires targeting by control measures (Lindblade et al.,
2014; Fakhar, 2013; Koffi et al., 2006; Berthier et al., 2016). The recent identification in West
Africa of asymptomatic individuals with human trypanosomiasis (long-term seropositives) but unde-
tected parasitaemia, raises the question of what role these individuals play in disease transmission
(Koffi et al., 2006; Jamonneau et al., 2012; Bucheton et al., 2011; Kanmogne et al., 1996). Ther-
apy is currently only directed towards microscopy-positive individuals and thus a proportion of the
infected population remain untreated.
There is convincing evidence that seropositive individuals with low or undetected parasitaemia
contain transmissible trypanosomes. Xenodiagnosis experiments, in which tsetse flies are fed on
microscopy-negative infected humans (Frezil, 1971) or, more recently, experimentally-infected pigs
(Wombou Toukam et al., 2011), have shown that these apparently aparasitaemic hosts contain the
parasite since the tsetse flies became infected. It is uncertain where the trypanosomes reside in the
host but, given the telmophagus (slash and suck) feeding habit of the tsetse fly, they could be skin-
dwelling parasites ingested with the blood meal. Our findings suggest that parasites may be suffi-
ciently abundant in the skin to allow transmission and therefore the skin may represent an anatomical
reservoir of infection.
Detection of trypanosomes in the skin is not well documented, although there are descriptions of
cutaneous symptoms associated with African trypanosomiasis and distinct ‘trypanid’ skin lesions
(McGovern et al., 1995). Imaging data from mouse models of infection suggest that trypanosomes
sequester to major organs such as the spleen, liver and brain (Blum et al., 2008; Kennedy, 2004)
and
recent
evidence
has
demonstrated
trypanosomes
in
extravascular
adipose
tissue
(Trindade et al., 2016). These adipose-associated trypanosomes appear to be a new life-cycle stage
with a distinct transcriptional profile and, while tsetse bite-site associated transmission has been sug-
gested (Caljon et al., 2016), and a historical study made a passing observation of localised deposi-
tion of trypanosomes in the skin matrix (Goodwin, 1971), the broader role of skin-dwelling
trypanosomes in transmission remains unclear. In this paper we report the investigation of a possible
anatomical reservoir in the skin of the mammalian host. We provide conclusive evidence of T.b. bru-
cei, (a causative agent of animal trypanosomiasis) and the human-infective trypanosome, T.b. gam-
biense, invading the extravascular tissue of the skin (including but not restricted to the adipose
tissue) and undergoing onward transmission despite undetected vascular parasitaemia. We also pro-
vide evidence of localisation of trypanosomes within the skin of undiagnosed humans. The presence
of a significant transmissible population of T. brucei in this anatomical compartment is likely to
impact future control and elimination strategies for both animal and human trypanosomiases.
Results
In order to investigate the potential for extravascular skin invasion by T. brucei, BALB/c mice were
inoculated via IP injection with the low virulence STIB247 strain of T. brucei and skin sections were
assessed over a 36-day time-course. The presence and relative quantities of extravascular parasites
were evaluated by semi-quantitative scoring of the histological samples (Figure 1—source data 1)
and compared to blood parasitaemia (Figure 1—source data 2). Extravascular parasites were first
observed in the skin 12 days post-infection and remained throughout the experiment. Skin parasite
numbers fluctuated to a lesser extent than blood parasitaemia and the apparent periodicity in the
skin may be due to one particularly high data point on day 24 (Figure 1). Parasites were found in the
dermis, subcutaneous adipose tissue (Figure 2) and in fascia beneath the panniculus carnosus mus-
cle. We did not detect any particular clustering around dermal adipocytes. The presence of parasites
in the skin was not associated with major inflammation (Supplementary file 1). To confirm that skin
invasion by this parasite was not strain or sub-species specific, the more virulent TREU927 strain of
T. brucei and the human-infective T.b. gambiense strain, PA, were used to infect mice. Extravascular
skin invasion of the dermis, subcutaneous adipose tissue and fascial planes (Figure 2—figure

 supplement 1) was evident with associated mild to moderate inflammation (Supplementary file 2),
in some instances the degree of skin invasion in the T.b. gambiense infected mice was far greater
than T.b. brucei, perhaps suggesting a greater propensity for sequestration in this sub-species.
To confirm that the extravascular distribution of parasites was not an artefact of the route of inoc-
ulation, infections by natural vector transmission were carried out using a bioluminescent T.b. brucei
strain, AnTat1.1E AMLuc/tdTomato. Mice were infected by a single infective bite of an individual G.
m. morsitans. After 4 to 11 days and up to the end of the experiment, parasites were observed in
the skin with a dynamic distribution (Figure 3A) and a variable density (Figure 3B). Parasites were
first detected in the blood between 5 and 19 days after natural transmission and parasitaemia
remained lower than 10 (Kanmogne et al., 1996) parasites/ml. Observed bioluminescence directly
reflects the total number of living parasites in the entire organism, including blood and viscera, but
the intensity of the signal decreases with tissue depth. Therefore, at the end of each experiment,
mice were sacrificed and their organs were checked for bioluminescence. The presence of extravas-
cular parasites in cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues was first demonstrated by bioluminescence
imaging in entire dissected skins (Figure 3C) and was not necessarily localised to the bite site. In
addition to the skin, only the spleen, some lymph nodes and adipose tissue were observed to be
positive for bioluminescence in several individuals (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). This suggests
that the observed bioluminescence is likely to originate predominantly, but not solely, from parasites
in the skin. In addition, only mild inflammation was observed after 29 days (Figure 3—figure supple-
ment 2).
To confirm that trypanosomes in the skin are a viable population, fluorescent parasites were mon-
itored by two intravital imaging methods following IP injection and natural transmission (Figure 4).
First, IP-injected fluorescent T. brucei STIB247 were imaged in vivo using 2-photon microscopy
(Figure 4A). Extravascular trypanosomes observed in the dermal layer of dorsal skin were highly
motile, consistent with viability (Video 1). Second, naturally-transmitted fluorescent T. brucei
AnTat1.1E AMLuc/tdTomato were imaged in vivo using spinning-disk confocal microscopy in the
C57BL/6J-Flk1-EGFP mouse line that has green fluorescent endothelial cells in the lymphatic and

parasitaemia of T.b. brucei strain STIB247 (red) and the semi-quantitative score of extravascular parasites in the

measured using phase microscopy using methodology outlined in (Lumsden, 1963). Skin parasite burden is an
average of five high-power fields scored by histological analysis (0 = no parasites detectable; 1 = low numbers of
parasites; 2 = moderate numbers of parasites; 3 = large numbers of parasites). Standard error shown (n = 3).

 blood vessels (Ema et al., 2006) (Figure 4B). Extravascular trypanosomes were observed in the der-
mal layer of the ear and were highly motile (Videos 2, 3 and 4).
Differentiation of dividing trypanosomes to non-dividing stumpy forms is essential for transmis-
sion to the tsetse. Using the relative transcript abundance of the stumpy marker Protein Associated
with Differentiation 1 (PAD1) (Dean et al., 2009) to an endogenous control, Zinc Finger Protein 3
(ZFP3) (Walrad et al., 2009), we estimated that approximately 20% of skin-dwelling parasites were
stumpy (Supplementary file 3). To directly determine the proportion of stumpy forms in skin sec-
tions, histological staining for PAD1 was also performed (Table 1—source data 4). PAD1-positive
cells were observed in variable proportions (from 8 to 80%) in all bioluminescent skin samples exam-
ined after IP injection (Supplementary file 4). Following natural transmission, up to 38% of parasites
detected using VSG surface markers (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–B) also expressed PAD1
(Figure 3—figure supplement 3C–D) (n = 441 cells from 8 skin sections). In all skin sections, stumpy
parasites were homogenously distributed in the dermis and subcutaneous adipose tissues.
We next assessed the ability of skin-dwelling parasites to infect tsetse flies. Teneral flies (imma-
ture flies that have not yet taken a blood meal) were fed on different regions of skin from mice
infected with AnTat1.1E AMLuc/TY1/tdTomato with differing levels of bioluminescence across the
skin (Table 1—source data 1 and Table 1—source data 2). This was repeated in 20 mice with differ-
ing levels of parasitaemia. Flies were dissected and checked for the presence of fluorescent trypano-
somes after two days (Table 1). In mice with undetectable or low parasitaemia (<5 � 104 parasites/

 ml), no parasites were found in flies fed on non-
bioluminescent regions. Conversely, a median of
36% (± 23%, n = 70) of flies that fed on bioluminescent regions of low parasitaemic mice became
infected (Table 1 and Table 1—source data 3). This demonstrates that skin parasites, from mice
without visible parasitaemia, can contribute to tsetse infection, possibly reflecting human asymptom-
atic infections. When parasites were detected in the blood and skin, tsetse infection rates increased
up to 100% (median of 61% ± 22%, n = 120) (Table 1 and Table 1—source data 3). Parasites taken-
up from the skin were able to further develop through the life-cycle to early procyclic forms in the fly
as evidenced by GPEET-procyclin marker on the parasites surface (n = 721 cells from 16 flies)
(Table 1—source data 4 and Supplementary file 4).
To demonstrate that skin invasion by trypanosomes can occur in humans as well as the murine
model, slides of historical skin biopsies, taken as part of a diagnostic screening programme for
Onchocerca microfilaria in the trypanosomiasis-endemic Democratic Republic of the Congo, were
examined for trypanosomes. At the time of sampling, the incidence of trypanosomiasis was 1.5–2%
and we hypothesised that some individuals may have harboured undiagnosed infections. Re-exami-
nation of 1121 skin biopsies by microscopy revealed six individuals with trypanosomes in their skin
(Figure 5). These individuals had not previously been diagnosed with human trypanosomiasis by clin-
ical signs or the presence of blood parasites.
Discussion
We have shown that there exists a significant yet overlooked population of live, motile, extravascular
T. brucei in the dermis and subcutis of animal models infected by artificial routes or by vector trans-
mission. It is likely that once injected the parasites disseminate via the lymph and blood to the skin
where they are ingested during tsetse fly pool-feeding and readily initiate cyclical development in
the vector. Given the relative volume of the skin organ compared to the vasculature, it is possible,
depending on the density of skin invasion, that more parasites exist in the skin than in the blood.

 The skin, therefore, represents an unappreciated
reservoir of infection. The extravasation of trypa-
nosomes
was
described
previously
in
major
organs such as liver, spleen (Blum et al., 2008;
Kennedy,
2004)
and
visceral
adipose
tissue
(Trindade et al., 2016), but the importance of
these parasites in transmission was not investi-
gated. Here we show that these skin-dwelling try-
panosomes contribute to transmission and could
explain the maintenance of disease foci, despite
active screening and treatment. Skin invasion for
enhanced transmission is likely a powerful evolu-
tionary force driving extravasation, suggesting
that the generalised tissue penetration underlying
pathogenesis (i.e. splenomegaly, hepatomegaly,
CNS invasion) is a secondary epiphenomenon. A
skin reservoir also presents a novel target for
diagnostics (e.g. skin biopsies), allowing the prev-
alence of infection to be accurately determined
and the identification of any previously unde-
tected animal reservoirs of human disease.
The skin as an anatomical reservoir of parasites
is a recurring theme in arthropod-borne human
diseases
such
as
Leishmania
(Sacks,
2008;
Schlein, 1993) and Onchocerca (Symptomatol-
ogy, 1974; Dalmat, 1955). Here we present evi-
dence of trypanosomes in the skin of hitherto
undiagnosed individuals. This anatomical reservoir
may serve to explain how HAT foci re-emerge and
persist despite low numbers of reported cases even in the absence of an animal reservoir
(Kagbadouno et al., 2012; Cordon-Obras et al., 2009; Balyeidhusa et al., 2012).

 Table 1. Skin parasites are ingested during tsetse pool-feeding. Mice were IP infected with T.b. brucei AnTat1.1E AMLuc/TY1/
tdTomato and the parasitaemia and bioluminescence were monitored daily until the day of xenodiagnosis. The number of parasites in
the blood was determined using a haemocytometer or a flux cytometer. The number of parasites in the skin was estimated from the
measured bioluminescence intensity by using a standard curve (Table 1—source data 1 and Table 1—source data 2). Batches of
teneral flies were fed on different skin regions of mice infected with differing levels of bioluminescence across the skin and with
differing levels of parasitaemia (Table 1—source data 2 and Table 1—source data 3). Fly batches A4A, A2A, B1A, 3B and 3A were
used to assess tsetse transmission in hosts with low numbers of blood parasites but high numbers skin parasites, while fly batches 1B,
1A, 4B, 4A, 2B, 2A, B2B and B4A were used to investigate the impact of high numbers of parasites in both the skin and blood. Flies
were dissected and their midguts checked for the presence of fluorescent trypanosomes after two days to determine the proportion
of infected flies (Table 1—source data 4A–B). For some of these experiments, results of an in-depth quantification of parasite stages
by IFA is provided in Supplementary file 4. Stumpy forms were observed only in the blood of mice with parasitaemia values
highlighted in purple. Bioluminescence was detected in the skin of mice with values highlighted in grey.

 HAT was once widespread across much of sub-Saharan Africa but concerted control efforts
brought it close to elimination during the 1960s (World Health Organization 2000, 2013). How-
ever, disease foci persisted, with a resurgence in the number of reported cases to over 300,000 in
the 1990s (World Health Organization 2000; Steverding, 2008). Currently, HAT is approaching
elimination in many areas (World Health Organization 2013; Simarro et al., 2012). Understanding
how HAT evaded elimination in the latter half of the 20th century and how it continues to persist is
vital to efforts to eliminate the disease. For example, our results indicate that it may be necessary to
develop novel therapeutics capable of accessing extravascular compartments. The current policy in
most endemic countries is not to treat serologically positive individuals unless they demonstrate
active infection, due to the long duration and high toxicity of treatment and the low predictive value
of the serological tests. We suggest that this policy should be reconsidered in light of our compel-
ling evidence that they represent a carrier population which may maintain HAT foci and explain pre-
viously thwarted efforts to eliminate this major pathogen.
Materials and methods
Trypanosome strains and cultures
All strains used in this study are pleomorphic. STIB247 is a low virulence T.b. brucei strain that indu-
ces a chronic infection and was isolated from a hartebeest in the Serengeti in 1971 (Geigy et al.,
1973). TREU927 is the genome reference strain for T. brucei and is more virulent than STIB247. This
strain was isolated from a tsetse fly in Kenya in 1969/1970 (Goedbloed et al., 1973). PA is a human-
infective group 1 T.b. gambiense strain isolated from a patient in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo in 1975 (Tait et al., 1984). mCherry STIB247 was created by transfection of STIB247 with
pHD1034-mCherry (Myburgh et al., 2013). This strain constitutively expresses fluorescent mCherry
from the ribosomal RNA promoter and its expression is stable over repeated passage.
The AnTat 1.1E clone of T.b. brucei was derived from a strain originally isolated from a bushbuck
in Uganda in 1966 (Le Ray et al., 1977). Bloodstream forms were cultivated in HMI11 medium sup-
plemented with 10% foetal calf serum at 37˚C in 5% CO2. This strain was genetically engineered to
produce two strains continuously expressing the red-shifted luciferase (PpyRE9H) and the tdTomato
red fluorescent protein either individually or in combination.
For the first AnTat 1.1E strain, the pTbAMLuc plasmid (M. Taylor, London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine, UK) was used for continuous cytosolic expression of the red-shifted luciferase
PpyRE9H. The tdTomato coding sequence was cloned with HindIII and BamHI into the pTSARib

from previously unidentified cases of human trypanosomiasis from the Democratic Republic of Congo, showing the presence of extravascular parasites
in biopsies from three individuals (A, B and C). Skin biopsies were collected as part of a national onchocerciasis screening programme that took place
in the same geographic region as an active trypanosomiasis focus. Slides were stained with Giemsa and examined under oil immersion at 100x
magnification. In addition to visible slender forms (black arrows) in the extravascular tissue of the skin, a clearly identifiable stumpy transmission form
with typical morphology and an unattached undulating membrane is also present in the skin of one individual (red arrow in A). The scale bar represents
5 mm.

 vector (Xong et al., 1998), generating the final pTSARib-tdTomato construct. The two plasmids
were linearised with KpnI and SphI restriction enzymes, respectively, and used to transform procyclic
parasites with an Amaxa Nucleofector (Lonza) (Burkard et al., 2007). After 24 hr, transfected cells
were selected by the addition of blasticidin or puromycin (10 mg/ml). After one week, the population
was examined (i) for red fluorescence by fluorescence microscopy and (ii) for both red fluorescence
and bioluminescence by using a fluorimeter Infinite 200 (Tecan, Switzerland). Cells were sub-cloned
by limiting dilution, and clone selection was performed after 15 days by measuring both biolumines-
cence in a microplate reader Infinite 200 (Tecan) and fluorescence with a Muse cell Analyzer (Merck-
Millipore). This strain, named AnTat1.1E AMLuc/tdTomato, was used for natural transmission
experiments.
The second AnTat 1.1E strain expressing the 3.1 Kb chimeric multiplex reporter protein
PpyRE9H::TY1::tdTomato was named AnTat 1.1E AMLuc/TY1/tdTomato. This cytoplasmic reporter
is composed of three distinct markers: the red-shifted luciferase (PpyRE9H) is fused to the tdTomato
red fluorescent protein by a TY1 tag. Briefly, the 1.68 Kb optimised version of the North American
firefly Photinus pyralis luciferase (Branchini et al., 2005) was fused with a 10-bp sequence known as
TY1-tag (Bastin et al., 1996) and cloned into the pTSARib plasmid (Xong et al., 1998) by using
XhoI and HindIII restriction enzymes to obtain the pTSARib-PpyRE9H-TY1 plasmid. Finally, the 1.4
Kb coding region of the tdTomato fluorescent protein was inserted downstream using HindIII and
BamHI. The resulting 8.9 Kb vector, containing a blasticidin S resistance cassette, was linearised with
SphI to integrate the rDNA promoter locus. Bloodstream parasites were transformed with an Amaxa
Nucleofector (Lonza) (Burkard et al., 2007), sub-cloned by limiting dilution, and clone selection was
performed by measuring both bioluminescence in a microplate reader Infinite 200 (Tecan) and fluo-
rescence with a Muse cell Analyzer (Merck-Millipore). The selected AnTat 1.1E AMLuc/TY1/tdTo-
mato sub-clone was comparable to the parental wild-type strain in terms of growth rate (Table 1—
source data 1A), pleomorphism (Table 1—source data 4C), tsetse infectivity and virulence in mice
(Table 1—source data 2). In order to verify the reliability of the bioluminescent marker as well as to
define the bioluminescence detection threshold of the AnTat 1.1E AMLuc/TY1/tdTomato selected
sub-clone, a parasite density / bioluminescence intensity analysis was performed in 96-micro-well
plates with an IVIS Spectrum imager (Perkin Elmer). Parasite density and bioluminescence intensity
were correlated when bioluminescence levels were higher than 104 p/s/cm2/sr, corresponding to
about 103 parasites, allowing estimation of the parasite density from in vivo imaging over this thresh-
old (Table 1—source data 1B). This correlation was verified by quantification in a microplate reader
Infinite 200 (Tecan) at the very beginning of the first in vivo experiment as well as the end of the last
one, demonstrating the stability of the triple reporter expression in the AnTat 1.1E AMLuc/TY1/
tdTomato selected sub-clone over time, especially after at least one full in vivo parasite cycle in the
tsetse fly and the mammalian host (Table 1—source data 1C). This strain was used for xenodiagno-
sis experiments and quantification of parasite densities.
Mouse strains
BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice were used as models for chronic disease (Magez and Caljon, 2011). In
addition, to allow for further 3D intravital imaging of the lymphatic and blood systems, C57BL/6J-
Flk1-EGFP mice expressing a GFP tagged Kdr (Flk1) gene encoding the vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) were used (Ema et al., 2006).

dance with the recommendations from the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the
European Union (European Directive 2010/63/UE) and the French Government. The protocol was

Skin invasion time-course
A total of 36 eight-week old BALB/c mice (Harlan, UK) were inoculated by intra-peritoneal (IP) injec-
tion with 104 parasites of strain STIB 247. Parasitaemia was assayed on each subsequent day using

 phase microscopy (Lumsden, 1963). Twenty-four uninfected animals served as controls. Every three
days for 36 days, three infected animals and two uninfected animals were culled and 2 cm2 skin sam-
ples removed from the dorsum. Skin samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin prior to
histological analysis.
Natural infections using tsetse flies
Tsetse flies (Glossina morsitans morsitans) were maintained, infected and dissected at the Institut
Pasteur as described previously (Rotureau et al., 2012). Flies were infected with AnTat1.1E AMLuc/
tdTomato parasites. Positive flies were selected first by screening the abdominal fluorescence (mid-
gut infection) 15 days after the infective meal, and then by a salivation test (mature salivary gland
infection) after one month. Single flies with salivary gland infections were used to infect the abdo-
men of mice anaesthetised by IP injection of ketamine (Imalgene 1000 at 125 mg/kg) and xylazine
(Rompun 2% at 12.5 mg/kg) and feeding was confirmed by visual observation of the fly abdomen
full of blood. Control mice were either not bitten or bitten by uninfected flies. The presence and
density of parasites in the blood was determined daily by automated fluorescent cell counting with a
Muse cytometer (Merck-Milllipore, detection limit 5.102 parasites/ml) or by direct examination under
a phase microscope with standardised one-use haemocytometers (Hycor Kova, detection limit 104
parasites/ml), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Infection for xenodiagnosis
A total of 20 seven-week-old male C57BL/6J Rj mice (Janvier, France) were IP injected with 10
(Jamonneau et al., 2012) AnTat 1.1E AMLuc/TY1/tdTomato bloodstream forms. Parasitaemia was
assayed daily by automated fluorescent cell counting with a Muse cytometer (Merck-Millipore,
detection limit 5.102 parasites/ml) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
PAD1/ZFP3 relative expression
Three BALB/c were infected with T.b. brucei strain TREU927 and culled at day 11. The mice were
perfused and a 2 cm2 region of skin removed from the flank. Skin sections were lysed using a Qiagen
Tissuelyzer LT and RNA extracted using a Qiagen RNAeasy kit following the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. 100 ng of RNA from each sample was reverse-transcribed using an Invitrogen Superscript III
RT kit. qPCR was performed on each sample using 5 ml of cDNA using a protocol and primers vali-
dated previously (MacGregor et al., 2011) on an Agilent Technologies Stratagene Mx3005P qPCR
machine. The ratio of PAD1 to ZFP3, and hence the proportion of cells transcribing the PAD1 gene,
was estimated using the Agilent Technologies MXPro software.
Xenodiagnosis
Mice were first anaesthetised by IP injection of ketamine (Imalgene 1000 at 125 mg/kg) and xylazine
(Rompun 2% at 12.5 mg/kg). Batches of 10 teneral male tsetse flies (from 8 to 24 hr post-eclosion)
were then placed in 50 ml Falcon tubes closed with a piece of net through which they were allowed
to feed directly on mouse skin regions of interest for 10 min. The selection of the skin regions for fly
feeding was based on mice bioluminescence profiles and parasitaemia. Unfed flies were discarded
and fed flies were maintained as previously described. Anaesthetised mice were finally sacrificed by
cervical dislocation and their skin was dissected for controlling bioluminescence with an IVIS Spec-
trum imager (Perkin Elmer). All the flies were dissected and checked for the presence of trypano-
somes either 2 or 14 days after their meal on mouse skin by two entomologists blinded to group
assignment and experimental procedures. Dissections were performed as previously described
(Rotureau et al., 2012), entire midguts were scrutinised by fluorescence microscopy to detect and
count living red fluorescent parasites, and positive midguts were further treated for IFA. A total of
420 flies were used in 3 independent xenodiagnosis experiments.
In vitro bioluminescence imaging
To perform the parasite density / bioluminescence intensity assay with AnTat 1.1E AMLuc/TY1/tdTo-
mato bloodstream forms, parasites were counted, centrifuged and resuspended in fresh HMI11
medium at 10.106 cells/ml. Then, 100 ml (or 106 parasites) of this suspension were transferred into
black clear-bottom 96-well plates and serial 2-fold dilutions were performed in triplicate adjusting

 the final volume to 200 ml of HMI11 with 300 mg/ml of beetle luciferin (Promega, France). Luciferase
activity was quantified after 10 min of incubation with a microplate reader Infinite 200 (Tecan), fol-
lowing the instructions of the Promega Luciferase Assay System. After background removal, results
were analysed as mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
In vivo bioluminescence imaging
Infection with bioluminescent parasites was monitored daily by detecting the bioluminescence in
whole animals with the IVIS Spectrum imager (Perkin Elmer). The equipment consists of a cooled
charge-coupled camera mounted on a light-tight chamber with a nose cone delivery device to keep
the mice anaesthetised during image acquisition with 1.5% isofluorane. D-luciferin potassium salt
(Promega) stock solution was prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 33.33 mg/ml, filter-
sterilised and stored in a �20˚C freezer. To produce bioluminescence, mice were inoculated IP with
150 ml of D-luciferin stock solution (250 mg/kg). After 10 min of incubation to allow substrate dis-
semination, all mice were anaesthetised in an oxygen-rich induction chamber with 2% isofluorane,
and images were acquired by using automatic exposure (30 s to 5 min) depending on signal inten-
sity. Images were analysed with Living Image software version 4.3.1 (Perkin Elmer). Data were
expressed in average radiance (p/s/cm2/sr) corresponding to the total flux of bioluminescent signal
according to the selected area (total body of the mouse here). The background noise was removed
by subtracting the bioluminescent signal of the control mouse from the infected ones for each
acquisition.
2-photon microscopy
Intravital multi-photon microscopy studies were carried out using a Zeiss LSM7 MP system equipped
with a tuneable titanium:sapphire solid-state two-photon excitation source (4W, Chameleon Ultra II,
Coherent Laser Group) coupled to an Optical Parametric Oscillator (Chameleon Compact OPO;
Coherent). Movies were acquired for 10 to 15 min with an X:Y pixel resolution of 512 � 512 in 2 mm
Z increments producing up to 40 mm stacks. 3D tracking was performed using Volocity 6.1.1 (Perkin
Elmer, Cambridge, UK). Values representing the mean velocity, displacement and meandering index
were calculated for each object. Mice were anaesthetised IP using medetomidine (Domitor 0.5 mg/
kg) and ketamine (50 mg/kg) and placed on a heated stage. Following removal of hair with a depila-
tory cream, dorsal skin was imaged. An intravenous injection of non-targeted quantum dots
(Qdot705) (Life Technologies, UK) prior to imaging allowed visualisation of blood vessels.
Spinning-disk confocal microscopy
AnTat1.1E AMLuc/tdTomato parasites were monitored in the ear of Kdr (Flk1) C57BL/6J Rj mice by
spinning-disk confocal microscopy as described previously (Rotureau et al., 2012). Briefly, mice
were first anaesthetised by IP injection of ketamine (Imalgene 1000 at 125 mg/kg) and xylazine
(Rompun 2% at 12.5 mg/kg). Mice were wrapped in a heating blanket and placed on an aluminium
platform with a central round opening of 21 mm in diameter. A coverslip was taped on the central
hole and the mouse was positioned so that the ear was lying on this oiled coverslip. Imaging was
performed using an UltraView ERS spinning-disk confocal system (Perkin Elmer) with a x40 oil objec-
tive (1.3 numerical aperture). Movies were acquired by an EM-CCD camera (Hamamatsu) controlled
by the Volocity software (Perkin Elmer) with an exposure time of 500 ms for a total of 30 to 120 s.
Images were analysed using ImageJ 1.48v and its plugin Bio-formats importer (NIH).
Histological and immunohistochemical evaluation of the skin
Paraformaldehyde-fixed skin samples were trimmed and processed into paraffin blocks. Sections
were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin (HE). Additional serial sections were processed for immu-
nohistochemical staining using a polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against the invariant surface gly-
coprotein 65 (IGS65) (M. Carrington, Cambridge, UK) using a Dako Autostainer Link 48 (Dako,
Denmark) and were subsequently counterstained with Gill’s Haematoxylin.
Histopathological assessment of inflammation in the skin
The extent of cutaneous inflammatory cell infiltration was assessed in haematoxylin and eosin stained
sections with a semi-quantitative scoring system applied by two pathologists blinded to group

 assignment and experimental procedures. The extent of mixed inflammatory cell infiltration in the
dermis and/or subcutis was assessed on a 0 to 3 grading scale (0 = no inflammation or only few scat-
tered leukocytes; 1 = low numbers of inflammatory cells; 2 = moderate numbers of inflammatory
cells; 3 = large numbers of inflammatory cells). Ten high-power fields were scored for each skin sam-
ple. An inflammation score calculated as the average of the scores in the 10 high-power fields was
determined for each sample.
Semi-quantitative evaluation of the parasite burden in skin sections
Parasite burden was assessed in skin sections stained with anti-IGS65 antibody by two pathologists
blinded to group assignment and experimental procedures. Presence of parasites defined as intra-
vascular (parasites within the lumen of dermal or subcutaneous small to medium-sized vessels) and
extravascular (parasites located outside blood vessels, scattered in the connective tissue of the der-
mis or in the subcutis) was evaluated in 5 randomly selected high-power fields at x40 magnification
with a 0 to 3 semi-quantitative grading scale (0 = no parasites detectable; 1 = low numbers of para-
sites (<20); 2 = moderate numbers of parasites (20 < 50); 3 = large numbers of parasites (>50). An
average parasite burden score was calculated for each sample.
Immunofluorescence analysis
Cells were treated for immunofluorescence after paraformaldehyde or methanol fixation as
described previously (Dean et al., 2009). Parasites were stained with one or two of the following
antibodies: (i) the anti-CRD polyclonal rabbit antibody (1:300) to label the cross-reactive determinant
of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors of proteins, predominantly the variant surface glycopro-
teins (Zamze et al., 1988), (ii) the anti-PAD1 polyclonal rabbit antibody (1:100) targeting the carbox-
ylate-transporter Proteins Associated with Differentiation 1 (PAD1) (Keith Matthews, Edinburgh, UK)
(Dean et al., 2009), (iii) the anti-GPEET mouse IgG3 monoclonal antibody (1:500) targeting the T.
brucei GPEET-rich procyclin (Acris Antibodies GmbH, San Diego, USA), (iv) the L8C4 mouse IgG1
monoclonal antibody labelling an epitope of the PFR2 protein (Kohl et al., 1999). Specific antibod-
ies with minimal cross-reactions with mice and coupled to AlexaFluor 488, Cy3 or Cy5 (Jackson
ImmunoResearch, USA) were used as secondary antibodies. DNA was stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI). IFA image acquisition was carried out on a Leica 4000B microscope with a x100
objective lens using a Hamamatsu ORCA-03G camera controlled by Micro-manager and images
were normalised and analysed with ImageJ 1.49v (NIH).
Histopathology of historical human skin samples
Historical human skin samples were collected from 1991 to 1995 as part of The National Onchocerci-
asis Task Force (NOTF) (Makenga Bof et al., 2015). Of this collection, 1121 paraffin embedded skin
samples were cut into 2.5 micron sections and stained with Giemsa (Sigma-Aldrich). Slides were
screened for the presence of parasites by two pathologists independently and representative images
taken at x100 magnification.

the skin of three BALB/c was estimated using qPCR at day 11 post-inoculation with T.b. brucei strain
TREU927. Mice were culled and perfused to remove blood parasites and a 2 cm (Fakhar, 2013)
region of skin removed from the flank. The tissue was homogenised and RNA extracted. 100 ng of
RNA from each sample was reverse-transcribed and qPCR performed to estimate the cycle thresh-
olds (CT) of the stumpy marker PAD1 and the endogenous control ZFP3. As CT is inversely propor-
tional to amount of target cDNA in the sample and PAD1 and ZFP3 have similar qPCR efficiencies, a
comparison of the delta (D) of CT between PAD1 and ZFP3 transcripts reveals the relative ratio of
PAD1 to ZFP3 transcripts and hence the proportion of differentiated parasites transcribing the
PAD1 gene.

parasites in the skin and in the blood govern the tsetse infection rates during pool feeding. For
some of the xenodiagnosis experiments shown in Table 1, identification and quantification of para-
site stages was performed by IFA on blood smears and skin sections.Stumpy forms were observed
only in the blood of mice with parasitaemia values highlighted in light grey. Bioluminescence was
detected in the skin of mice with values highlighted in dark grey. The number of parasites in the skin
was calculated according to the values obtained in the standard in vitro assay (Table 1—source data
1) and is therefore probably an underestimate. Tsetse flies were dissected 2 days after xenodiagno-
sis. Populations of intermediate and stumpy form cells were assessed in blood smears and in succes-
sive skin sections stained either with the anti-CRD antibody or the anti-PAD1 antibody (see
Materials and method section). Populations of early procyclic cells were assessed in dissected fly
midguts stained with the anti-GPEET antibody (see Materials and method section). ND: not
determined.
