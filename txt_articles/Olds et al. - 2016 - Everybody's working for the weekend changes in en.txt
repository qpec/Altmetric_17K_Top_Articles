Abstract
Background: the aim of this study was to explore the associations between use of time and momentary hedonic affect
(‘enjoyment’) in adults in the peri-retirement period.
Methods: a total of 124 adults [61 males, 63 females; age 62 (4) years] completed a computerised use-of-time recall on 4
days at each of four time points (3–6 months pre-, 3, 6 and 12 months post-retirement), as well as surveys regarding self-
reported health, well-being, sleep quality and loneliness. They reported how much they enjoyed each activity on a 0–10 scale.
An individual Enjoyment Index was calculated as the time-weighted average of each participant’s enjoyment ratings. Time-
weighted enjoyment ratings were also calculated for nine mutually exclusive and exhaustive activity domains (Sleep, Chores,
Work, Social, Screen Time, Self-care, Quiet Time, Transport, Physical Activity) and sub-domains.
Results: the mean (±SD) Enjoyment Index was 7.43 ± 0.61, and was significantly and positively associated with well-being
(P = 0.003 to P < 0.0001) and sleep quality (P = 0.03 to P < 0.0001), and negatively associated with loneliness (P = 0.003
to P < 0.0001). Mean Enjoyment Index values increased significantly (P < 0.0001) from pre-retirement (7.19 ± 0.82) to
post-retirement (7.46 ± 0.89, 7.42 ± 0.91 and 7.49 ± 0.89 at 3, 6 and 12 months post-retirement). There were significant
differences in enjoyment across domains, with Physical Activity (7.86 ± 1.11) and Social (7.66 ± 0.85) being the most enjoy-
able, and Work (7.10 ± 0.89) and Chores (7.09 ± 0.85) the least enjoyable.
Conclusion: enjoyment of everyday activities increased after retirement and remained elevated for at least 12 months.
Work appears to constitute a relative hedonic deficit.
Keywords: older people, use of time, happiness, physical activity, screen time
Introduction
Subjective well-being or ‘happiness’ has both an evaluative
component (how satisfied we are in general), and an affect-
ive hedonic component (the moment-to-moment balance
of positive and negative affect) [1]. A growing body of
research links subjective well-being with health outcomes
[2–4]. In a meta-analysis of 160 human and animal cross-
sectional, longitudinal and intervention studies, Diener and
Chan [5] found ‘clear and compelling’ evidence that subject-
ive well-being is associated with significantly better health
and life expectancy. A meta-analysis of experimental studies
[6] found that induced positive affect resulted in enhanced
immune and cardiovascular responses, perhaps mediated by
neural, inflammatory and neuroendocrine changes [7].
One factor affecting well-being is how we use our time.
The 1985 American Time Use Survey [8] asked respondents
to rate how much they enjoyed different types of activity on
a 0–10 scale. Ratings for sports (9.2) and sex (9.1) were very
high, while respondents were less fulsome about grooming
(6.5) and passive transport (6.3). In this survey, respondents
were not asked to rate a particular instance of sport or
850

 grooming, but sport and grooming in general. It seems likely
that the enjoyment of particular activities may be modulated
by contextual factors such as the weather, day of the week,
who else is present and where it is done [9].
An understanding of which activities people find enjoy-
able, and the factors associated with the level of enjoyment,
particularly as they pass through life transitions (such as mar-
riage, unemployment and children leaving home), may help
us to understand the health impacts of time use, to identify
who might be at risk of low positive affect and promote activ-
ities which are both health-enhancing and enjoyable.
The aim of this study was to understand how much
adults in the peri-retirement period enjoyed their daily activ-
ities, how that enjoyment changed across the retirement
threshold, how enjoyment varied across activity domains
and whether enjoyment ratings were associated with socio-
demographic and contextual variables.
Methods
This study was part of a larger cohort study of people transi-
tioning into retirement [10]. Ethics approval was provided by
The University of South Australia HREC (Protocol no.
0000023494) and The University of Queensland Behavioural
and Social Sciences ERC (Protocol no. 2011001152).
Participants
A total of 139 participants intending to retire within 3–6
months were enrolled in this study. Of these, 15 withdrew
(6 did not retire, 8 cited personal reasons and 1 was uncon-
tactable), and 124 completed both baseline (3–6 months
pre-retirement) and at least one other time-point (3, 6 and
12 months post-retirement) and were retained for analysis.
Interviews were conducted between 2012 and 2014.
‘Retirement’ was defined as working ≥19 h per week before
retirement, and reducing working hours by ≥19 h per week,
with ≤11 h work per week in retirement.
Measurements
Use of time
We used the Multimedia Activity Recall for Children and
Adults (MARCA), a computer-assisted 24-hour use-of-time
recall, to capture activity profiles. The MARCA asks partici-
pants to recall everything they did in the last 24 h, using
meals as anchor points. Recalled activities were classified
into one of 520 discrete activities, with the minimum time
for any activity being 5 min. The adult version of the
MARCA has test–retest reliabilities in adults of 0.920–0.997
for major domains such as sleep, physical activity and
screen time, and convergent validity between MARCA-
derived physical activity level and accelerometer counts/
minute of rho = 0.72 [11] and rho = 0.70 with doubly
labelled water in young adults [12].
Participants were asked how much they enjoyed each
activity using an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (‘I hated it!’)
to 10 (‘I loved it!’). Enjoyment ratings show good test–
retest reliability when the same day was recalled twice (ICC
= 0.81, bias = 0.06, Limits of Agreement −2.17 to +2.29, n
= 1532; [13]). At each of the four time points, two tele-
phone interviews were conducted, during which participants
recalled the 2 previous days. At each time point, partici-
pants recalled at least one weekday and one weekend day,
and all data were weighted 5:2 for weekdays:weekend days.
Socio-demographic and anthropometric data
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from measured
height and weight. Participants completed a questionnaire
reporting their age, gender, marital status and gross house-
hold income. They also reported their occupation type
(managerial/professional, clerical, manual), whether they
worked as a volunteer, and health status. They completed
the Australian Unity Wellbeing Index [14], a valid and reli-
able nine-item questionnaire asking them to rate their satis-
faction with various elements of their lives on a scale from
0 (‘completely dissatisfied’) to 10 (‘completely satisfied’).
Scores were summed to generate an aggregate Wellbeing
Index. Participants also completed the UCLA Loneliness
Scale, a valid and reliable instrument which consists of 20
items scored on a 4-point scale, asking participants how
often they feel connected to others. A score was derived as
described by Russell [15]. Finally, they reported sleep quality
using a 4-point scale.
Data treatment
The 520 activities in the MARCA have been categorised hier-
archically into nine mutually exclusive and exhaustive activity
‘superdomains’ [16], each divided into sub-domains called
‘macrodomains’ (Supplementary data, Appendix Table S1,
available in Age and Ageing online). Activity domains are defined
using lists of activities, and the rubrics are only indicative. For
example, some work-related activities (such as driving) might
be classified under other rubrics (such as Transport).
Enjoyment Index values were generated for each partici-
pant, which were the time-weighted average of all enjoy-
ment ratings across the four recalled days at each time
point. This was done for all activities taken together, and
for activities falling under the different activity domains.
Statistical analysis
Data were unavailable for 96 out of 1984 potential recalled
days. Missing data were imputed by carrying values forward
or backward from the nearest completed time-point.
Univariate associations between the Enjoyment Index
values and socio-demographic characteristics were explored
using Pearson’s or Spearman’s correlation coefficients for
continuous correlates, and factorial ANOVA for categorical
correlates. Enjoyment Index values across time, and among
activity domains, were compared using repeated-measures
ANOVA. Sequential Bonferroni adjustment was used to
allow for multiple comparisons. Post hoc comparisons were

 performed using Bonferroni-adjusted t-tests. The sample
size of 124 was sufficient to detect correlations ≥0.25 and
effect sizes (Cohen’s d) ≥0.25 with 80% power and an alpha
of 0.05.
Results
Characteristics of participants and instances
Pre-retirement characteristics are presented in Table 1.
Participants worked 34 (SD 9) hours per week prior to
retirement.
Participants recalled a total of 72 618 activity instances.
Recalls were fairly evenly spread across the days of the
week, with the exception of Fridays (Thursdays and Fridays
were combined for logistical reasons), ranging from 20% of
recalls on Wednesdays to 13% of recalls on Tuesdays.
Overall Enjoyment Index ratings
Across the four time points, non-domain-specific individual
Enjoyment Index values ranged from 4.80 to 9.96, with a
mean (SD) of 7.39 (0.78). These values showed strong corre-
lations (r = 0.62 to 0.81) with each other across time points.
Domain-specific Enjoyment Index values also showed con-
sistent correlations across time ranging from r = 0.37 to 0.82.
Enjoyment was not significantly associated at any time
point with age, gender, BMI, marital status, type of employ-
ment, volunteer status or income. Better self-reported
health was weakly associated with higher enjoyment at 3
and 9 months post-retirement only (P = 0.006, P = 0.03).
Three characteristics were consistently associated with the
Enjoyment Index at all four time points:
• Well-being was positively associated with enjoyment (r =
0.29 to 0.41, P = 0.003 to P < 0.0001).
• Better sleep quality was associated with higher enjoyment
(P = 0.03 to <0.0001). Participants reporting very good
sleep quality scored 0.7–1.1 units higher than those
reporting bad or very bad sleep quality.
• Loneliness was inversely associated with enjoyment (r=
−0.28 to −0.41, P = 0.003 to P < 0.0001).
Enjoyment ratings showed characteristic time-related pat-
terns across the day (Figure 1). Pre-retirement, weekdays
showed the depressive influence of work, with enjoyment
declining after breakfast, rising transiently at morning tea,
lunch and afternoon tea and a rapid rise as the work day
ended. Post-retirement, the weekday pattern better resembled
the weekend pattern, with higher enjoyment ratings (effect
size = ~0.5). Weekend patterns were similar pre- and post-
retirement, although enjoyment was higher post-retirement.
Day of the week was also associated with enjoyment:
ratings decreased slightly from Monday (7.41) and Tuesday
(7.43) to a nadir on Wednesday (7.34), then started to rise
on Thursday and Friday (7.42), peaking on Saturday (7.55)
and Sunday (7.55)
Domain-specific Enjoyment Index values
Enjoyment Index values varied significantly (P < 0.0001)
across
superdomains
(Table
2,
Supplementary
data,
Appendix Figure S1, available in Age and Ageing online), in
the following order: Physical Activity, Social, Self-care,
Sleep, Screen, Quiet Time, Transport, Work, Chores. The
highest enjoyment ratings were for Physical Activity (mean
rating = 7.86 ± 1.11), followed by the Social superdomain
(7.66 ± 0.85). Transport (7.20 ± 0.96), Work (7.10 ± 0.89),
and Chores (7.09 ± 0.85) scored below average.
Changes in Enjoyment Index across the retirement
threshold
Mean Enjoyment Index values increased significantly (P <
0.0001)
from
pre-retirement
(7.19
±
0.82)
to
post-
retirement (7.46 ± 0.89, 7.42 ± 0.91 and 7.49 ± 0.89 at 3, 6
and 12 months post-retirement respectively, mean effect
size = 0.36). Values at 3, 6 and 12 months post-retirement
were not significantly different, but all were higher than the
pre-retirement values. Changes in the overall Enjoyment
Index
between
pre-retirement
and
12
months
post-
retirement were not related to age, sex, marital status,
income, education, occupation, health status, loneliness,
well-being or sleep quality at baseline, or to changes in
BMI, income, well-being or loneliness.
The average Enjoyment Index values increased signifi-
cantly across retirement for Social, Self-care, Quiet Time,
Transport
and
Chores.
Typically,
enjoyment
ratings
increased rapidly from pre-retirement to 3 months post-
retirement, and remained elevated thereafter. Changes were
partly due to shifts towards more enjoyable activities within
superdomains, but were mainly due to retirees getting more

 enjoyment out of doing the same activities post-retirement.
When enjoyment ratings for individual activities (n = 163)
which were performed at both pre-retirement and 12
months post-retirement were compared, there had been a
significant (P < 0.0001) increase of 0.24 units.
Discussion
Key findings
This study found that enjoyment of activities generally
increased across the retirement threshold. The most enjoy-
able superdomains were Physical Activity and Social, and
the least enjoyable were Work and Chores. Work was per-
ceived negatively in terms of enjoyment. Four lines of evi-
dence point to this conclusion. First, Work was rated the
second least enjoyable activity domain. Second, overall
enjoyment increased significantly after retirement, and
remained elevated even after 12 months. Third, across the
working day, enjoyment decreased when the trip to work
began, was momentarily elevated during work breaks, and
rose again at the end of the working day. Finally, the finding
that enjoyment increased as the week progressed is consist-
ent with the ‘Thank God it’s Friday’ phenomenon [17].
Relative to retirement, work therefore constitutes a hedonic
drag. It seems people were not only ‘working for the week-
end’ over the week, but were also working for the ‘eternal
weekend’ of retirement.
Comparison with other studies
The findings of this study are broadly consistent with the
sparse literature on enjoyment of activities of daily living.
Kahneman and colleagues [4] reported differential levels of
enjoyment according to use of time, and Menec [18] found
that activities such as social gatherings, reading alone and
light housework were positively associated with happiness,
while other activities such as heavy housework were not.
The enjoyment ratings reported by our sample were also
similar to those of Americans in the American Time Use
Survey [8]. In relation to patterns of enjoyment across the
week, Stone and colleagues [17] similarly reported that the
mood of a very large sample (n = 340 000) of US partici-
pants was highest on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays relative
to other days of the week. Mihalcea and Liu [19] conducted
a linguistic ethnographic analysis of blogposts, and also
found that Wednesday was the least happy day of the week.
Implications
Retirement is sometimes seen as having the potential to
reduce well-being because of the loss of social networks
and purpose in life, particularly for single retirees [20]. This
study found evidence to the contrary, with systematic
increases in enjoyment which did not differ by marital sta-
tus. These increases were in part due to retirees pursuing
different
activities
across
and
within
superdomains.
However, there was a consistent and large increase in
enjoyment across most activity superdomains, and in the
same individual activities. In other words, retirees get great-
er enjoyment from doing the same things they did before
retirement.
Work certainly appears to be a relative hedonic negative,
and research might focus on how work can be made more
enjoyable. Following retirement, some participants contin-
ued to work part-time, and enjoyment in the Work domain
increased substantially post-retirement. This suggests that
the work activities per se are not inherently unpleasant, but
that the work context (perhaps restricted sleep, time pressure
and lack of autonomy) makes them relatively unpleasant.
Findings from the study regarding the enjoyment of
physical activities may have useful implications for physical
activity intervention efforts. Many existing physical activity
interventions seek to promote physical activity using strat-
egies such as increasing walking and doing active chores
around the house. However, this study identified that these
are among the least enjoyable activities. Chores were rated
the lowest of all the superdomains, and although Physical
Activity as a whole was highly rated, walking (7.69 ± 1.43)
was ranked lower than most other types of physical activity,
below running (7.86 ± 1.12), cycling (8.27 ± 1.11),
swimming/surfing (8.60 ± 0.97) and playing with animals
(9.18 ± 1.03).
Strengths and limitations
This study used a high-resolution use-of-time instrument
(the MARCA) to capture the enjoyment of specific activities
in specific contexts, using the day reconstruction method.
In-depth telephone interviews were undertaken with a rela-
tively large sample (n = 124) followed longitudinally, allow-
ing us to quantify the association between individual
characteristics and enjoyment.
An important caveat is that participants only rated the
activities that they actually performed. Since people are
more likely to do things they enjoy, these ratings are prob-
ably somewhat higher than would be obtained if people
were asked to rate a checklist of activities. Additionally,
enjoyment ratings may be retrospectively modified and may
not reflect the experienced enjoyment at the time when the
activities were performed. Finally, the sample was wealthier
and better educated than the general Australian population
[21]; however, enjoyment in this study was not related to
income.
