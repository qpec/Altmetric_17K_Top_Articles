Effect of an automated notification system
for deteriorating ward patients on clinical
outcomes
Christian P. Subbe1*, Bernd Duller2 and Rinaldo Bellomo3
Abstract
Background: Delayed response to clinical deterioration of ward patients is common.
Methods: We performed a prospective before-and-after study in all patients admitted to two clinical ward areas in
a district general hospital in the UK. We examined the effect on clinical outcomes of deploying an electronic
automated advisory vital signs monitoring and notification system, which relayed abnormal vital signs to a rapid
response team (RRT).
Results: We studied 2139 patients before (control) and 2263 after the intervention. During the intervention the
number of RRT notifications increased from 405 to 524 (p = 0.001) with more notifications triggering fluid therapy,
bronchodilators and antibiotics. Moreover, despite an increase in the number of patients with “do not attempt
resuscitation” orders (from 99 to 135; p = 0.047), mortality decreased from 173 to 147 (p = 0.042) patients and
cardiac arrests decreased from 14 to 2 events (p = 0.002). Finally, the severity of illness in patients admitted to the
ICU was reduced (mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score: 26 (SD 9) vs. 18 (SD 8)), as was
their mortality (from 45% to 24%; p = 0.04).
Conclusions: Deployment of an electronic automated advisory vital signs monitoring and notification system to
signal clinical deterioration in ward patients was associated with significant improvements in key patient-centered
clinical outcomes.

Background
Deterioration of patients on general hospital wards
often goes unnoticed for prolonged periods of time [1].
This delay can result in otherwise preventable cardio-
pulmonary arrest and admission to the intensive care
unit (ICU) [2, 3] despite the fact that, in most cases,
measurable changes in vital signs [4] could identify
patients at risk. Such delayed or absent response to
deterioration has been labeled as “failure to rescue” [5],
which may be due to a combination of factors [6]. In
order to decrease the incidence and consequences of
such failure to rescue, many hospitals have introduced
rapid response systems (RRSs) [7]. Rapid response
systems have been shown to reduce hospital mortality,
the rate of cardiopulmonary arrests and preventable
ICU admissions, in a number of settings [8]. Neverthe-
less, even in hospitals with an established RRS, failure-
to-rescue
events
occur
[9–11],
mostly
related
to
problems with the afferent (monitoring, identification
and rapid response team (RRT) activation) component
of the RRS. All these failings have in common the de-
pendence on individual bedside staff to raise the alarm.
In contrast to human-based response, industrial high-
reliability systems rely on redundancy to ensure that
failure of a single part does not result in system failure
[12, 13]. When this approach is applied to monitoring
in health care, systems with automated notification can
be deployed to notify remote and senior healthcare
professionals or RRTs who are not at the bedside to
respond to deterioration [14, 15]. This approach can be
supplemented with continuous monitoring of selected

 vital signs such as heart rate, respiratory rate and oxy-
gen saturation. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the
application of monitoring technology with automated
notification of the RRT would improve the reliability of
escalation of care for clinically deteriorating patients on
general wards, and result in improved patient outcomes.
Methods
Setting
We conducted a before-and-after study on two wards of
a university-affiliated hospital serving a population of
220,000 inhabitants in the UK. The hospital covers all
hospital specialties including a hematology and oncology
unit and a dialysis unit but does not provide neuro-
surgical, cardiothoracic or transplant surgery care. The
ICU has eight beds and there are a further five high de-
pendency and five coronary care beds.
The intervention was undertaken on two general med-
ical wards with 30 and 24 beds, respectively, one admitting
patients predominantly with respiratory disease and the
other admitting patients with predominantly gastroentero-
logical conditions. The two study wards were selected due
to their large proportion of patients with abnormal and
complex physiology as evidenced by high rates of critical
care transfers and cardiopulmonary arrest prior to the
commencement of the study.
Ethics
The hospital human research ethics committee (Reference
12/WA/0050, Protocol number SD-05163-BBN-IGS A.2)
approved the study. Monitoring remained in line with
hospital policy in the control and intervention phase. The
ethics committee confirmed that no patient consent was
required.
Study patients
We included all patients admitted to the study wards as
acute emergencies if they had at least one overnight stay
(more than 24 hours of admission). We excluded patients
admitted for elective procedures (such as pulmonary
biopsy, pleural procedures or endoscopy). Data from all
patients were collected on age, gender, main diagnosis
(ICD 10 code), date of admission, date of discharge, degree
of physiological abnormality as described by the National
Early Warning Score (NEWS) [16] on admission, survival
status and limitation of medical treatment (LOMT).
Rapid response system
Hospital policy stipulates the recording of vital signs in
acutely unwell patients at least twice per day and with
increasing frequency in the presence of increasing
severity, usually four times per day. Trained registered
nurses and health care assistants obtained and recorded
vital signs.
We deployed three different scoring algorithms to
identify patients at risk: the NEWS was used as the de-
fault algorithm. The Chronic Respiratory Early Warn-
ing Score (CREWS) [17] was used in patients with
chronic hypoxia due to chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease or pulmonary fibrosis. The CREWS algorithm
uses different weighting for abnormalities of oxygen
saturation. A palliative algorithm scored all patients ac-
cording to the NEWS algorithm but did not result in
notifications. Patients were allocated to either NEWS,
CREWS or the palliative algorithm by senior medical
staff or the nurse in charge of the ward.
The local vital sign protocol recommends escalation to
the nurse in charge of each ward in patients with a score
of 3 or more. For a score of 6 or more, it recommends
additional escalation to a resident doctor and an ad-
vanced nurse practitioner member of the RRT. For a
score of 9 or more, it recommends escalation to the lead
of the medical on-call team (a physician with a mini-
mum of four years of clinical experience). We obtained
data on several key interventions (i.e. fluid bolus, antibi-
otics, bronchodilators and time on ventilators). In order
to avoid subjective judgment, all notifications were clas-
sified as independent events.
Study period
The control and intervention phases were separated by a
washout period. Wards were allocated to the interven-
tion phase of the study with a two-month difference. Pa-
tient data were collected from 15 October 2012 to 16
October 2013 for the control period in ward 1 and from
1 October 2012 to 2 October 2013 for the control period
in ward 2.
Data were collected in the intervention phase from 17
February 2014 in ward 1 and 28 April 2014 in ward 2
until all the interventions ceased in both wards on 17
April 2015. Additional control data were collected in
ward 2 from 17 February 2014 to 17 April 2014 to run
parallel with the intervention start period in ward 1 for
two months.
Intervention
During the intervention period an electronic automated
advisory vital signs monitoring system (Intelivue Guardian
Solution (IGS) with cableless sensors and MP5SC spot-
check monitors, Philips Healthcare, Boeblingen, Germany)
was deployed to each study ward. The monitoring system
electronically transfers and displays respiratory rate, blood
pressure, heart rate, pulse oximetry and temperature either
obtained by the bedside nurses using spot-check monitors
(Fig. 1a) or by cableless sensor devices. The spot-check
monitors request the nurse to manually enter respiratory
rate (RR) or to confirm an RR measurement from a wireless
patient sensor. Information on conscious state was entered

 manually. Early warning scores (EWSs) were automatically
calculated from these vital signs.
The NEWS and CREWS values were displayed and
color-coded at central screens (Fig. 1b) in the nursing
station as: “safe range” in white; “observe range” in
yellow; “warning range” in orange, and “urgent range” in
red. The same color codes were used on screens in the
offices of consultant physicians of the ward.
Cableless devices for respiratory rate (Philips IntelliVue
CL Respiration Pod, Fig. 1c, d) and saturations (Fig. 1e)
were set to record vital signs every 15 minutes. Cableless
blood pressure devices (Fig. 1f) were set to start a series of
7 measurements every 15 minutes on demand only and at
times of EWS. Deployment of cableless sensors was at the
discretion of the treating clinicians. Overall, 278 patients
had at least one cableless sensor attached during the
intervention
phase.
Based
on
automated
cableless
measurements, “deterioration notifications” were paged
and were displayed on a big central screen if a change in
the cableless parameters resulted in a change of the EWS.
Nurses on the study wards and members of the RRT
received notifications about abnormal vital signs via a
dedicated alphanumeric paging device (Fig. 1g) that
would display the value of the score, the location of the
patient and information about the trend (for example
“Bed A1, NEWS changed from 5 to 9, call (telephone
number)”).
Training in how to use the EWS and the escalation
protocol preceded the current study. Training in the use
of the IGS was undertaken in two workshops and a
dedicated trainer was on site at the hospital for the first
week of the intervention period of each of the study
wards for in-service training in day and night shifts until
80% of staff had been trained.
Outcome measures
We obtained information on the prevalence of prede-
fined serious events (acute myocardial infarction, pul-
monary embolism, acute pulmonary edema, respiratory
failure, stroke, severe sepsis, acute renal failure, emer-
gency admission to the ICU, cardiopulmonary arrest,
death), activations of the RRT and patient outcomes,
using the hospital administration system and clinical
records. Trained research nurses extracted the data.
Data on cardiopulmonary arrests were extracted from
clinical notes and cross-referenced with the clinical ad-
ministration system of the hospital. The same process
was followed for deaths in the study wards and admis-
sions to the ICU.
The hospital also collected data as part of the Intensive
Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC)
case-mix program including data on severity of illness
on admission to the ICU as measured by the Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE
II) score [18].
Statistical analysis
All statistical analysis was performed using Minitab
(V16, Minitab Inc., PA, USA) and the Software Package
for Social Sciences (SPSS V22). For continuous vari-
ables, descriptive statistics are presented as means with
standard deviation or 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Where appropriate, medians and interquartile ranges
(IQRs) are given. Categorical variables are presented as
actual number and proportion of overall count. Con-
tinuous variables were compared using the Mann–
Whitney test or the Student t test as appropriate, while
categorical variables were compared using the chi-
square, normal approximation or Fisher’s exact test.
Binary logistic regression with a backward stepwise
(Wald) procedure was used to confirm that mortality
and cardiac arrests were independently associated. A p
value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The
sample size of the study was based on limited data from
local spot-check audits: 100 events per phase and ward
were considered, according to pertinent nomograms
and Gpower software calculations (SIG level 0.05,
Power 0.8), to prove a relevant effect.
Results
Patient characteristics
During the control period, the 2139 patients with a
mean
age
of
68.8
years
(standard
deviation
(SD)
17 years) were admitted to the study wards compared
to 2263 patients with a mean age of 68.6 years (SD
17.3)
who
were
admitted
during
the
intervention
period.
Patient
characteristics
are
summarized
in
Table 1. Patients on the respiratory ward had greater
severity of illness as measured by NEWS on admission
to hospital (2.40, 95% CI 2.24–2.57; p < 0.001). The
NEWS algorithm was used in 80% of patients, the
CREWS algorithm was in used in 16% of patients; 4%
of patients were palliative.
Notifications
During the control period, 755/2139 patients (35.3%)
reached a score of 6 or more. Their mean age was 72.0
(SD 14.2) years and 387/755 patients (51%) were female.
Notification of the RRT, however, occurred only 405
times in 304 patients (1.33 per patient, 189/1000 admis-
sions (18.9%)). The mean age in this patient subgroup
was 71.9 (SD 15.1) years. Of these, 320/2139 patients
(15.0%) reached a score of 9 or more (Table 2).
During the intervention period, 747/2263 patients
(33.0%) reached a score of 6 or more. Their mean age
was 72.3 (SD 14.4) years and 396/747 (53%) patients
were female. Notification of the RRT occurred 524 times

 in 365 patients in the intervention phase (1.43 per
patient,
231/1000
admissions
(23.1%),
p = 0.001
for
comparison with control period). The mean age of this
patient subgroup was 70.3 (SD 15.7). Of these patients,
302/2263 (13.3%) reached a score of 9 or more.
Response to notifications
During the 929 notifications (405 notifications in 304 pa-
tients in the control phase and 524 in 365 patients in the
intervention phase), the RRT undertook a range of medical
interventions (Table 3) with mortality in affected patients
changing from 67/304 (22.0%) in the control phase to 63/
365 (17.3%) in the intervention phase (p = 0.122).
Outcomes
There were 14 cardiac arrests (6.5/1000 discharges, 3.5%
of RRT notifications) in the control period compared
with two (0.8/1000 discharges, 0.4% of RRT notifica-
tions) in the intervention period (p = 0.002). We ob-
served 320 deaths in 4402 patients (mortality 7.3%).
Hospital mortality was 173/2139 patients (8.1%) during
the control and 147/2263 (6.5%) during the intervention
period (difference 1.59%, 95% CI 0.05–3.13%; p = 0.042).
After exclusion of readmissions, the mortality benefit
remained significant in the higher acuity (as measured
by higher NEWS) respiratory ward (decrease from 110/
983 (11.2%) to 79/945 (8.4%); difference 2.83%, 95% CI
0.19–5.48%; p = 0.036), but not in the gastroenterology
ward.
Data from the 47 patients admitted to the ICU were
extracted from the ICNARC database (1% of 4402
patients)
these
comprised
26
patients
(12/1000
discharges) admitted during the control phase and 21
patients (9/1000 discharges) during the intervention
phase (p = 0.158). Mean APACHE II scores on admis-
sion to the ICU were significantly lower during the
intervention phase (18 ± 8 vs. 26 ± 9, p < 0.007). This
was associated with lower predicted mortality (24% vs.
45%, p < 0.006) and a decrease in actual mortality (3/21
(14%) vs. 11/26 (42%), p < 0.04).
In total, there were 268 serious events (268 in 2139
patients, 125 per 1000 patients) in the control and 185
serious events (185 in 2263 patients, 82 per 1000
patients) in the intervention period (p < 0.001) (Table 4).
Binary logistic regression
Reduced mortality was maintained in stepwise binary
logistic regression analysis including age, gender and
acuity (measured by type of ward) at step 1: there was
reduced mortality for patients admitted during the
intervention period (OR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.63–0.99; p =
0.043). The same was true for the rate of patients with
cardiopulmonary arrest (OR = 0.15, 95% CI 0.03–0.64;
p = 0.011) (Additional file 1: Table S1).

 Discussion
Key findings
We conducted a before-and-after study of an electronic
automated advisory vital signs monitoring and notifica-
tion system, which relayed abnormal vital signs to an
RRT. We found that implementation of such a system
led to a significant increase in RRT notifications and
more notifications, which triggered interventions such
fluid boluses, bronchodilators, and antibiotics. Moreover,
implementation was associated with a significant de-
crease in cardiac arrests, overall mortality in the sicker
of the two clinical areas, the severity of illness in those
patients admitted to ICU, and decreased ventilation time
and mortality in such patients, and more patients
received “do not attempt resuscitation” orders.
Relationship to previous studies
Automated assessment of physiological abnormalities
has been shown to reduce mortality among patients
seen by the RRT [19] but the effect on cardiac arrests
has not been reported. However, the intervention re-
duced the number of abnormal sets of vital signs from
four sets to three before a call to the RRT was under-
taken, implying earlier activation. Introduction of elec-
tronic documentation of vital signs was also associated
with a reduction in standardized hospital mortality in

 two large UK university hospitals [20], but it was un-
clear in which patient group this reduction occurred
and whether other concurrent changes might have
accounted for the improvement in outcomes.
There is a lack of studies measuring the impact of new
monitoring technology on clinical outcomes, with much
of the published work focused around technical feasibility
[21] and user acceptance [22]. In contrast, we used a com-
bination of wireless sensors to support care in the more
unstable patients, in effect facilitating more frequent re-
cording of vital signs with limited need for extra staffing.
Strengths and limitations
Our study has several strengths. It is the first detailed in-
vestigation of the effect of automated notifications on
team behavior and clinical outcomes in clinically deteri-
orating patients. To our best knowledge, this is also the
first study of cableless sensors deployed in a clinical trial.
The large number of patients, large number of activa-
tions, changes in clinical interventions and changes in
clinical outcomes documents for the first time that the
impact of an automated system across the whole path-
way of deterioration in patients was coherent.
Concerns have been raised about the feasibility of
implementation of the EWS in patients with respiratory
illness [23, 24]. We have shown that by adapting the
scoring algorithm, clinically meaningful results can be
achieved, even in this group of patients. To our know-
ledge, this study is also the first that has used a range of
scoring algorithms in order to individualize monitoring
plans, albeit in a single center.
Our study has some limitations: We did not collect data
on admission diagnosis and comorbidity beyond the
presence of significant lung disease. It also remains untested
whether findings would be different, for example, in a surgi-
cal population in whom the number of notifications might
be fewer [25, 26] and the patterns of expected physiological
derangement likely to be dominated by hypotension.
The fact that RRT responders received automated
notification during the intervention period meant that
they might have initiated communication more fre-
quently than in the observation period. Resulting phone
calls and conversations within parent teams are likely
not to have been fully documented in the clinical notes.
In the absence of an electronic patient record, we were
also unable to find reliable documentation to confirm
the timing of interventions. Our study was conducted in
a very specific environment and in a UK hospital. Its ex-
ternal validity to other institutions and patient cohorts,
therefore, needs to be assessed. Nursing teams were
appreciative of the technology used. We are aware that
especially with regards to continuous monitoring these
finding might not be generalizable [27, 28].
We do not have detailed data to explain the increase
in DNAR orders, not only overall, but also before RRT
notification. It is possible that the increase is notification
might have increased overall awareness of the overall
status of all patients and of the limitations of what med-
ical intervention could do for such patients, thereby in-
creasing pro-active decision making on end-of-life care.
Mortality was reduced in the study ward with the
sicker patient population. The fact that overall mortality
was not affected could be due to the fact that many of
the included patients would have suffered from ad-
vanced chronic diseases with limited reversibility after a
study period of more than two years. Further research is
needed in order to define the characteristics of patients
who most benefit from the type of intervention de-
scribed. Finally, the low rates of adverse events limit any
clinical inference made from statistical tests related to
their incidence during the two study periods.
Implications of study findings
This study implies that deployment of an electronic
automated advisory vital signs monitoring and notifica-
tion system, which relays abnormal vital signs to an
RRT, has the ability to significantly increase the number
of activations of the RRT. Moreover, it implies that
such an increase in activations can lead to decreased
overall mortality, cardiac arrests and illness severity in
those patients admitted to ICU, resulting in a specific
decrease in mortality among such patients. Finally, our
study implies that the more frequent activation affects
decision-making on end-of-life care toward greater use
of DNAR orders.
Future research
The findings of our study will need to be confirmed in
other patient groups (i.e. surgical, obstetric and pediatric
patients) and in other health care settings to tease out
how much our findings are context dependent [29]. The
mechanisms that result in improved outcomes also
require further research: Human-factor-led design with
reduction of cognitive load due to a graphic interface or
system design with modular redundancy and increase in
the number of staff members to are aware of emerging
deteriorations might be candidate mechanisms.
Conclusions
Implementation of an electronic automated advisory vital
signs monitoring and notification system appears to in-
crease RRT notifications and RRT interventions associated
with decreases in cardiac arrests, overall mortality, illness
severity and mortality in those patients admitted to ICU
and an increase in pro-active decision-making on end-of-
life care. Wider testing of this system in different popula-
tions and health care settings now appears justified.
