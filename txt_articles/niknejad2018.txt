IMPORTANCE Chronic noncancer pain (hereafter referred to as chronic pain) is common
among older adults and managed frequently with pharmacotherapies that produce
suboptimal outcomes. Psychological treatments are recommended, but little information is
available regarding their efficacy in older adults.
OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy of psychological interventions in older adults with chronic
pain and whether treatment effects vary by participant, intervention, and study characteristics.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched from
inception to March 29, 2017.
STUDY SELECTION Analysis included studies that (1) used a randomized trial design, (2)
evaluated a psychological intervention that used cognitive behavioral modalities alone or in
combination with another strategy, (3) enrolled individuals with chronic pain (pain �3
months) with a sample mean age of 60 years or older, and (4) reported preintervention and
postintervention quantitative data.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two of the authors independently extracted data. A mixed-
model meta-analysis tested the effects of treatment on outcomes. Analyses were performed to
investigate the association between participant (eg, age), intervention (eg, treatment mode
delivery), and study (eg, methodologic quality) characteristics with outcomes.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Pain intensity was the primary outcome; secondary
outcomes included pain interference, depressive symptoms, anxiety, catastrophizing beliefs,
self-efficacy for managing pain, physical function, and physical health.
RESULTS Twenty-two studies with 2608 participants (1799 [69.0%] women) were analyzed.
Participants’mean (SD) age was 71.9 (7.1) years. Differences of standardized mean differences
(dD) at posttreatment were pain intensity (dD = −0.181, P = .006), pain interference
(dD = −0.133, P = .12), depressive symptoms (dD = −0.128, P = .14), anxiety (dD = −0.205,
P = .09), catastrophizing beliefs (dD = −0.184, P = .046), self-efficacy (dD = 0.193, P = .02),
physical function (dD = 0.006, P = .96), and physical health (dD = 0.160, P = .24). There was
evidence of effects persisting beyond the posttreatment assessment only for pain
(dD = −0.251, P = .002). In moderator analyses, only mode of therapy (group vs individual)
demonstrated a consistent effect in favor of group-based therapy.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Psychological interventions for the treatment of chronic pain
in older adults have small benefits, including reducing pain and catastrophizing beliefs and
improving pain self-efficacy for managing pain. These results were strongest when delivered
using group-based approaches. Research is needed to develop and test strategies that
enhance the efficacy of psychological approaches and sustainability of treatment effects
among older adults with chronic pain.

 C
hronic noncancer pain (hereafter referred to as chronic
pain) is one of the most common conditions encoun-
tered by health care professionals.1 Chronic pain is par-
ticularly common among individuals aged 60 years or older
and is associated with substantial disability and health care
costs.1-5 Among older adults, management of chronic pain is
complicatedbyage-relatedphysiologicchanges,competingco-
morbidities that limit treatment options, patient barriers (eg,
fear of deleterious adverse effects from medications),6 health
care professional barriers (eg, lack of knowledge),7 large ad-
verseeffectprofilesofcommonlyadministeredpharmacologic
therapies,8 and a limited evidence base to guide treatment.5
Given these limitations and concerns, as well as the on-
going opioid epidemic,9 nonpharmacologic therapies that use
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches, including cog-
nitive and behavioral coping skills training, cognitive restruc-
turing, and behavioral activation techniques, have received in-
creased attention as treatments for individuals with chronic
pain.10-19 Cognitive behaviorally based approaches have been
shown to have small but statistically significant associations
with pain, mood, and disability in nonelderly adults with
chronic pain.10 In recent years, the number of studies inves-
tigating nonpharmacologic approaches for the treatment of
chronic pain in older populations is expanding. One quanti-
tative review examined the effectiveness of psychological ap-
proaches for chronic pain in older adults in studies published
between January 1975 and March 2008.11 This review, which
included12clinicaltrialsand5uncontrolledpilotstudies,found
that psychological approaches were moderately effective in re-
ducing pain but did not have a significant effect on depres-
sivesymptoms,physicalfunctioning,orpainmedicationuse.11
Given the increasing interest in nonpharmacologic
modalities and the expanding number of published studies
in this area over the past decade, we conducted a compre-
hensive systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate
the efficacy of CBT-based approaches for chronic pain
among older adults. As a secondary aim, we conducted pre-
planned analyses to determine whether specific participant
(eg, pain type), intervention (eg, mode of therapy delivery),
and study (eg, methodologic quality score) characteristics
moderated treatment outcomes.
Methods
Literature Search
This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed in
accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for System-
atic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement.20
Comprehensive searches of MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase
(Ovid), PsycINFO (EBSCOhost), and the Cochrane Library
(Wiley) were performed to identify clinical trials that evalu-
ated 1 or more psychological intervention for the treatment
of chronic pain in older adults published from database
inception through June 28, 2016. An updated search was
performed (from June 29, 2016, through March 29, 2017) to
identify new publications. Subject headings and keywords
included chronic pain, noncancer pain, musculoskeletal pain,
osteoarthritis, arthritis, rheumatoid, back pain, mindfulness,
cognitive therapy, behavioral therapy, cognitive-behavioral,
CBT, older adults, and elderly. The BMJ Clinical Evidence
Randomized Controlled Trial Strategy filter21 was applied to
the MEDLINE and Embase searches. We used a combination
of keywords and subject headings representing trials in the
PsycINFO and Cochrane searches. Additional studies were
identified by reference searching in Scopus using the “cited
by” and “view references” features. The MEDLINE search
strategy is provided in eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Eligibility Criteria and Study Selection
We included studies if they (1) used a randomized clinical trial
design; (2) evaluated CBT techniques (see Table 1 for details)
as a stand-alone treatment or in combination with another
strategy (eg, exercise); (3) enrolled participants with chronic
pain, defined as pain lasting 3 months or longer at the time of
enrollment; (4) focused on older individuals as reflected by a
sample mean age of 60 years or older; and (5) reported prein-
tervention and postintervention quantitative data (ie, means
and SDs or SEs) for each group for each assessment (or data for
baseline and change scores). We excluded studies that tar-
geted patients with pain due to cancer or chronic headache to
be consistent with a Cochrane review on this topic,10 did not
report full quantitative results on outcomes and were not will-
ing or able to share their data upon request, were published
in languages other than English, or were not published in a
peer-reviewed journal.
Afterduplicateswereremoved,2ofus(B.N.,R.B.)screened
titles and abstracts of the identified searches independently
followed by a full-text inspection of potentially eligible ar-
ticles to determine eligibility, with disagreements resolved by
consensus. The study selection process appears in eFigure 1
in the Supplement.
Accounting for Studies With Multiple Arms
Five studies used 3 arms.22-26 To ensure comparability across
all studies, we included 1 intervention and 1 control group from
these 5 studies. Two of the studies used 2 control groups.22,23

Key Points
Question Do older adults with chronic pain benefit from
psychological therapies?
Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis including 22
studies with 2608 participants, psychological interventions that
used cognitive behavioral therapy modalities were associated with
statistically significant benefits in terms of reduced pain and
catastrophizing beliefs as well as improved self-efficacy for
managing pain. Benefits were small and documented at the time
of treatment completion; with the exception of pain reduction,
evidence is lacking for the persistence of observed benefits in
other assessments conducted up to 6 months later.
Meaning Among older adults with chronic pain, psychological
therapies have a small, but statistically significant, benefit for
reducing pain and catastrophizing beliefs and improving
self-efficacy for managing pain.

ingcomponent)and1controlgroup.24Wepooledthedatafrom
the 2 intervention groups. One study reported 2 intervention
groups, including a group-based intervention and an indi-
vidual-based intervention; posttreatment outcomes were re-
ported as pooled data from the 2 intervention groups.25 Fi-
nally, 1 study used 2 intervention groups: 1 delivered CBT for
pain and insomnia and the other delivered CBT for pain only.
We extracted data from the CBT for pain-only group.26
Outcomes
The research team extracted data on outcomes that prior re-
search has shown to be positively affected by psychological
therapies10,11,15,16,23 as well as outcomes that were assessed in
a minimum of 4 studies in the sample. We abstracted data on
8 outcomes in 3 domains: pain (pain intensity, pain-related in-
terference),psychological(depressivesymptoms,anxiety,cata-
strophizing beliefs, and self-efficacy for managing pain), and
functional (self-reported physical function and physical
health). For studies that used more than 1 pain intensity mea-
sure (eg, current pain, average pain), we used the mean of the
measures as the outcome. Finally, we extracted data on 2 ad-
ditional outcomes given their importance—change in pain
medication use and adverse events.27 Table 2 reports the out-
comes assessed in each study.
For each outcome, mean and SD data were extracted for
intervention and control groups at pretreatment and post-
treatment, as well as for all other follow-up assessments. We
categorized any assessment that took place less than 12 weeks
after the completion of treatment as posttreatment. Due to
study differences in the follow-up assessments, we operation-
alized any assessment occurring between 12 or more weeks to
24 or fewer weeks after treatment completion as a mid-term
outcome, while those taking place longer than 24 weeks after
treatment completion were considered long-term outcomes.
Data Extraction
Data extraction included bibliographic information, demo-
graphic characteristics of the sample and clinical characteris-
tics when present, and data on the intervention, as well as out-
come data. Two of us (B.N., R.B.) performed double data entry
independently, and the resulting databases were then com-
pared with each other. Discrepancies were resolved through
consensus.
Quality Assessment and Risk of Bias
To judge the methodologic quality of the retained articles, we
used the quality rating scale developed by Yates et al,46 a valid
andreliableinstrumentdesignedtoevaluatethequalityofran-
domized clinical trials examining psychological interven-
tions in individuals with chronic pain. Total scores range from
0 to 35, with higher scores indicating better methodologic
quality.46 Two of us (B.N., E.K.) performed this assessment in-
dependently; discrepancies were resolved through discus-
sion. We did not exclude any study from the analysis based on
quality score but examined in moderator analyses whether the
quality score affected treatment outcomes. We also assessed
the risk of methodologic bias (appropriateness of randomiza-
tion, allocation bias, and measurement bias) using the Yates
tool.
Statistical Analysis
Meta-analyseswerecarriedoutinstatisticalmixedmodels.The
dependent variables were the standardized mean differences
over time for control and intervention (outcome mean differ-
ences divided by the SD of the difference). The primary model
included treatment (control vs intervention), time of assess-
ment (a repeated measure: baseline, first follow-up [treat-
ment completion], mid-term follow-up, and long-term follow-
up)asfixedclassificationfactors,theinteractionbetweenthese
factors, and studies as levels of a random classification fac-
tor. An unstructured error was specified. Random effects take
into account heterogeneity among studies.
The effect of the intervention on study outcomes was ex-
amined by the treatment × time interaction in this model and
the treatment effect specific to each of 3 time contrasts: base-
line to first follow-up (treatment completion), baseline to mid-
term follow-up, and baseline to long-term follow-up. The base-
line vs first follow-up contrast was the primary outcome of
interest because all studies reported outcomes at this assess-
ment. We carried out further examination of effects at the later
time points by models that looked at the baseline vs first fol-
low-up limited to the studies that provided data at later as-
sessments.
Results are reported in terms of differences of standard-
ized mean differences (dD) because of the numerous measure-
mentinstrumentsandscalerangesusedbythestudiesforeach
outcome. As a guide to the magnitude of the treatment ef-
fects, we show what dD represents for several outcome scales.
Additional independent variables were examined, includ-
ing study characteristics (study quality [high vs low], year of
publication, and pilot study vs larger-scale randomized clini-
cal trial), intervention characteristics (mode of treatment de-
livery [group vs individual]), level of therapist training (evi-
dence that therapists had appropriate training in intervention
components prior to the trial: adequate vs inadequate), treat-
ment fidelity (adherence to the therapist manual: adequate or
inadequate, mode of therapy [group vs individual], and du-
ration of the intervention phase in weeks), and participant

cificstudy-levelmethodologiccharacteristicsmoderatedtreat-
ment effects—whether effects were stronger for or limited to
certain levels of these characteristics—the focus was on the in-
teraction with treatment (overall and for specific time con-
trasts), including examination of homogeneity of regressions
for the covariates.47
In this type of meta-analysis, it is clear that an assumption
of studies as fixed (a single true effect size for all studies) is in-
appropriate.Trueeffectsizeswillvarybystudiesnotjustowing
to sampling error but also to differences in sample composition
(eg,age,ethnicity,andeducationallevel),methodsofassessment
and study protocol, variable definitions, overall study quality,
and numerous other factors. We used mixed models in which
studies are assumed to be random (sampled from a population
of studies). Effect sizes are assumed to differ by studies.
For the sake of completeness, we computed the Cochran
Q statistic and Higgins-Thompson H2 and I2 values to exam-
ine heterogeneity across studies.48 We examined the ques-
tion of publication bias by constructing a funnel plot with 1/
(SE), a measure of sample size, plotted against effect size.49
Results
Thedatabasesearchesidentified2391articles;238wereselected
based on title and abstract for full-text review to determine eli-
gibility. We included 22 studies (23 publications) with a total of
2608 participants (mean [SD] age was 71.9 [7.1] years and 1799
[69.0%] were women) in the final sample (Table 2).22-26,28-45
Participant Characteristics
Table 2 shows studies that evaluated participants with various
types of chronic pain, including back pain, pain due to osteoar-
thritisorrheumatoidarthritis,andmixedpaintypes.Wecatego-
rized types of chronic pain into 2 groups: musculoskeletal (17
studies) and other (5 studies). The other category included pa-
tients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 1) and mixed pain types
(n = 4). The mean (SD) pain duration was 16.1 (13.9) years.
Study Characteristics
The mean (range) length of the intervention period was 9.4 (4-
35)weeks.Themean(range)numberoftreatmentsessionswas
8.4 (6-14). Fifteen studies delivered an intervention using a
group-based approach, and the most common mode of treat-
ment delivery was in person, which was used by 19 studies
(Table 2).
Quality Assessment, Risk of Bias, and
Heterogeneity Appraisals
eTable 2 in the Supplement presents the Yates quality scores
for all 22 studies. The mean (range) quality score was 24.5 (13-
33). In the Yates et al46 study, articles with a score or 22.7 or
greater were deemed to have excellent methodologic quality.
Twelve (55%) studies met the criterion for taking steps to mini-
mize the possibility of measurement bias, while 10 (45%) were
judged to be at low risk for allocation bias (eTable 2 in the
Supplement). The funnel plot showed no clustering of stud-
ies in the lower right of the funnel that would indicate lack of
publication of smaller or nonsignificant studies (eFigure 2A,
B, and C in the Supplement).
The Cochran Q and I2 scores for the key variable—pain in-
tensity—were 25.9% and 27.6%, which did not indicate a high
degree of heterogeneity. Other outcomes showed similarly
modest heterogeneity.
Benefits of Therapy
Sixstudiesassessedforchangeinpainmedicationusebutused
different scales that precluded generation of a summary ef-
fect size.22,34-37,44 None of the studies reported any treatment-
related reduction in pain medication use, including opioid use.
The results of the meta-analyses appear in Table 3. Differ-
ences of standardized mean differences (dD) and correspond-
ing P values for the outcomes at posttreatment are pain inten-
sity (dD = −0.181, P = .006), pain interference (dD = −0.133,
P = .12), depressive symptoms (dD = −0.128, P = .14), anxiety
(dD = −0.205, P = .09), catastrophizing beliefs (dD = −0.184,
P = .046), self-efficacy for managing pain (dD = 0.193, P = .02),
physical function (dD = 0.006, P = .96), and physical health
(dD = 0.160, P = .24). The dD terms reported above (for pain,
catastrophizing, and self-efficacy) correspond to a baseline to
posttreatment reduction in pain intensity on a 0 to 10 scale of
0.49, in catastrophizing on a 0 to 6 scale of 0.32, and an im-
provement in self-efficacy on a 0 to 60 scale of 4.11 points.
The treatment result for pain intensity persists up to 6
months after treatment completion (dD = −0.251, P = .002).
There is no evidence of treatment results persisting in assess-
ments conducted greater than 24 weeks after treatment
completion, but this evaluation is confounded by the small
number of studies with data at that assessment and the mixed
results of models using only those studies in baseline vs post-
treatment comparisons.
The Figure displays a forest plot showing the effect size
for each study and corresponding weight given to each for pain
intensity at posttreatment, the key contrast of this study. The
pooled analysis indicates a significant benefit in favor of treat-
ment relative to controls.
Harms of Therapy
Only 3 studies assessed for adverse events.24,25,40 Two found
transient increases in pain associated with an exercise and be-
havioral skills training protocol,24,25 while the third reported
no serious adverse events associated with a mindfulness medi-
tation-based intervention.40
Moderator Analyses
To determine whether treatment effects differed by level of
the potentially moderating variables, we examined 11 inde-
pendent variables, 1 at a time, as additions to the primary
model, including their interactions with treatment and time

participant characteristics, intervention characteristics, and
study characteristics. Across all outcomes and possible mod-
erators, only mode of therapy showed a coherent pattern of
results. Other moderators were nonsignificant, and there were

nificant for pain intensity at mid-term follow-up (P = .01 for
group, P = .07 for individual). Too few studies conducted long-
term follow-ups for a meaningful examination of moderation
at this time point.

Psychological therapies for individuals with chronic pain have
received increased attention in the wake of the ongoing opi-
oid epidemic in the United States.9,50 Various initiatives have

 been launched to address the opioid crisis, including the re-
lease of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention opi-
oid guidelines for patients with chronic pain.51 The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention guidelines encourage clini-
cians to prescribe nonpharmacologic therapies, such as CBT,
for patients with chronic pain. Our results are relevant to the
management of chronic pain in older adults by demonstrat-
ingthatpsychologicalinterventionshavesalutary,albeitsmall,
benefitsfortreatmentofpain,catastrophizingbeliefs,andself-
efficacy. Mean treatment results demonstrated in the present
study obscure variations at the individual patient level. Some
older patients with chronic pain may receive substantial ben-
efit through psychological therapy, while others may not ben-
efit. There is no evidence that the beneficial results identified
at the completion of treatment persisted up to 6 months for
outcomes other than pain reduction. There were too few stud-
ies reporting long-term outcomes to determine completely
whether this finding was due to decreased power or to a ta-
pering of treatment benefits over time.
Theobservedbenefitswerestrongestwhendeliveredusing
group-based approaches. Potential mechanisms that could ac-
count for this finding include access to peer support, social fa-
cilitation of target behaviors, and public commitment to
therapy goals.52 No other results of participant, intervention,
or study characteristics were found. Treatment benefits were
equally likely to occur in older men and women irrespective
of age and duration of chronic pain.
Our results add to the existing literature by demonstrating
that older adults—an understudied population with respect to
thebenefitsofpsychologicaltherapiesforchronicpain15,16—can
benefitfromthesetreatmentapproaches.Ourfindingsaresimi-
lar to those reported in the Cochrane review,10 which demon-

Finally,fewstudiesevaluatedoutcomesmorethan6monthsaf-
ter treatment completion, so the long-term effects of these ap-
proaches remain poorly understood.
Implications for Practice
Our findings support guideline recommendations54,55 that en-
courage clinicians to consider psychological treatments in the
care of older patients with chronic pain, particularly those de-
livered using a group-based approach. Clinicians should learn
and share with patients basic information about psychologi-
cal approaches to managing pain. Inquiring about patients’
treatment expectations, including perceived benefits and po-
tential harms, is also important.1 Leveraging social supports
to encourage patients’continued use of psychological tech-
niques (eg, distraction, relaxation techniques) over time is also
warranted.1Finally,managementofchronicpaininolderadults
should be multimodal, including use of both pharmacologic
and nonpharmacologic approaches.54-57 Physical treatments
in the form of exercise and other movement-based ap-
proaches have demonstrated benefits in the form of reduced
pain and improved functioning, are safe to use in older adults,
and should also be considered.54-60

treatment effects can be enhanced and sustained by leveraging
research findings in the areas of temporal horizons61 and age-
relatedchangesinemotionalandcognitiveprocessing.62,63Prior
findings indicate that older adults prioritize well-being in the
present moment,64 which may make them reluctant to engage
inlong-termtreatmentprograms,andtheyaremorelikelytopro-

sights could be leveraged by emphasizing the immediate ben-

and crafting positively framed feedback messages to promote
long-termadherence.66Finally,moreresearchisneededregard-
ingtheroleofmobilehealthtechnologiesastoolstohelpdeliver

to the psychological techniques over time.67
Conclusions
Psychological interventions for the treatment of chronic pain
in older adults have beneficial, albeit small, associations with
pain and catastrophizing as well as self-efficacy for managing
pain. These benefits, documented at the completion of treat-
ment, were found to persist up to 6 months later only for pain
intensity reduction. Efforts are therefore needed to develop
and test psychological interventions that generate more ro-
bust treatment effects that are sustainable in this growing
population of patients.
