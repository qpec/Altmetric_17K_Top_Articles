BACKGROUND: In the United States, one in six children are affected by neurodevelopmental disorders, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)
in flame-retardant chemicals are measured ubiquitously in children.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic a systematic review regarding developmental exposure to PBDEs and intelligence or Attention Deficit/
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and attention-related behavioral conditions in humans.
METHODS: We searched articles published up to 26 September 2016, and included original studies that quantified exposures to PBDEs incurred any
time in proximity to conception or during in utero, perinatal, or childhood time periods. We evaluated the risk of bias of individual studies and the
overall quality and strength of the evidence according to the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology. We established criteria in advance to
identify studies that could be combined using random effects meta-analyses (DerSimonian-Laird method).
RESULTS: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria; 10 studies met the criteria for intelligence and nine for attention-related problems. We rated stud-
ies generally with “low” to “probably low” risk of bias and rated the overall body of evidence as “moderate” quality with “sufficient” evidence for an
association between Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and PBDEs. Our meta-analysis of four studies estimated a 10-fold increase (in other words, times 10)
in PBDE exposure associated with a decrement of 3.70 IQ points (95% confidence interval: 0.83, 6.56). We concluded the body of evidence was of
“moderate” quality for ADHD with “limited” evidence for an association with PBDEs, based on the heterogeneity of association estimates reported
by a small number of studies and the fact that chance, bias, and confounding could not be ruled out with reasonable confidence.
CONCLUSION: We concluded there was sufficient evidence supporting an association between developmental PBDE exposure and reduced IQ.
Preventing developmental exposure to PBDEs could help prevent loss of human intelligence. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1632
Introduction
The prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders such as au-
tism and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has
increased over the past four decades (Grandjean and Landrigan
2006; Newschaffer et al. 2005; Prior 2003; Rutter 2005; Visser
et al. 2010), currently estimated to affect about 15% of children
in the U.S. (Boyle et al. 2011; U.S. EPA 2013). This increase
cannot be completely explained by genetics, improved diag-
nostics, or known environmental risk factors (Hertz-Picciotto
and Delwiche 2009; Landrigan et al. 2012; NRC 2000;
Newschaffer et al. 2005), although increased diagnosis and
awareness of the disorders could play a role. Emerging science
has identified the potential role of toxic environmental chemi-
cals as being an underevaluated modifiable risk factor that may
interfere with brain development in fetuses and children
(Bennett et al. 2016). Environmental chemical exposures are
widespread in the population, and modest associations charac-
teristic of environmental risks can translate into adverse
population-level effects (Bellinger 2012; Institute of Medicine
1981).
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a group of syn-
thetic chemicals used as chemical flame retardants to inhibit or
resist the spread of fire (ATSDR 2004). PBDEs comprise 209
possible congeners, with the major congeners detected in human
and environmental samples being BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100,
and BDE-153 (Darnerud et al. 2001; Frederiksen et al. 2009;
Hites 2004; Sjodin et al. 2008). PBDEs have been used in polyur-
ethane foam and hard plastics and can be found in a variety of
everyday products, such as upholstered furniture, cars, mat-
tresses, building materials, textiles, and computers and other elec-
tronic equipment (ATSDR 2004; Birnbaum and Staskal 2004).
Because they can be present in significant quantities in products
(5–30% by weight) (Darnerud et al. 2001; World Health
Organization 1994) and because they are additives rather than co-
valently bound to consumer products, there is higher potential for
leaching, volatilization, or degradation, leading to consumer and
environmental exposures (Darnerud et al. 2001; Gill et al. 2004;
Watanabe and Sakai 2003). Human exposures are ubiquitous be-
ginning in utero (Morello-Frosch et al. 2016; Woodruff et al.
2011b), which is a highly vulnerable period of human brain devel-
opment (Grandjean et al. 2008), and PBDEs have been found per-
vasively in U.S. household dust samples (Darnerud et al. 2001;
Frederiksen et al. 2009; Mitro et al. 2016). Levels of PBDEs meas-
ured in Americans are the highest in the world, due to greater his-
toric use of these chemicals in the U.S. than elsewhere because of

Review
 differences in regulatory standards across countries (Besis and
Samara 2012; Frederiksen et al. 2009). Despite the recent phase-
out of production and use of PBDEs, exposures are expected to
continue for decades because they are widely prevalent in existing
consumer goods, such as furniture, and they are highly persistent
in the environment and bioaccumulate up the food chain
(Herbstman et al. 2010; Hites 2004; Norstrom et al. 2002; Sjodin
et al. 2008).
Several animal and human studies have explored associations
between developmental exposures to PBDEs and decrements in
motor development, cognitive development, and attention-related
behaviors (Chao et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2014; Costa and
Giordano 2007; Gascon et al. 2011, 2012; Herbstman et al. 2010;
Hoffman et al. 2012; Roze et al. 2009). Studies in children have
mostly focused on Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and ADHD-related
outcomes. IQ is the most commonly studied neurological end-
point in children, representing a combined score of a child’s func-
tion across several cognitive domains. IQ measured at school age
is an important indicator of child brain health and predictive of
academic and occupational success (Neisser et al. 1996).
Reduced IQ is predictive of diminished lifetime earnings
(Salkever 2014), increased risk for mortality, depression, diagno-
sis for certain medical conditions, and poorer health generally
(Batty et al. 2007a, 2007b, 2009; Der et al. 2009). ADHD and
attention-related behavioral conditions may have implications for
children’s academic and social abilities, as well as their respec-
tive families’ functioning (Bagwell et al. 2001; Faraone et al.
2001; Harpin 2005; Johnston and Mash 2001). Furthermore,
symptoms may persist into adulthood, creating concern for long-
term effects of the disorder (Barkley 2002; Gudjonsson et al.
2012; Nijmeijer et al. 2008; Spencer et al. 2014; Wehmeier et al.
2010; Weiss and Hechtman 1993).
To assess the evidence of PBDEs’ contribution to neurode-
velopmental disorders, we conducted a systematic review of
human studies examining developmental exposure to PBDEs
and 1) quantitative measures of intelligence and 2) ADHD and
attention-related behavioral problems, such as hyperactivity,
inattention, impulsivity, or response inhibition.
Methods
Systematic Review Methodology
Although systematic review methods have been used for decades
in the clinical sciences (Guyatt et al. 2008; Higgins and Green
2011), detailed methods for conducting a systematic review
directly applicable to the decision context and evidence streams
in environmental health have only recently been developed and
utilized in the field of environmental health sciences (Johnson
et al. 2014, 2016; Koustas et al. 2014; Lam et al. 2014; Rooney
et al. 2014; Vesterinen et al. 2014; Woodruff et al. 2011a;
Woodruff and Sutton 2014). We conducted our review using the
Navigation Guide, a systematic review methodology for evaluat-
ing environmental evidence based on methods used in the clinical
sciences (Johnson et al. 2014, 2016; Koustas et al. 2014; Lam
et al. 2014, 2016; Vesterinen et al. 2014; Woodruff et al. 2011a), i.
e., the Cochrane Collaboration and Grading of Recommendations
Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) (Guyatt et al.
2008; Higgins and Green 2011; Woodruff et al. 2011a). As is
standard practice for systematic reviews and the Navigation
Guide, we developed a protocol prior to initiating the review and
registered it in PROSPERO (Lam et al. 2015a).
Study Question
Our objective was to answer the questions: “Does developmental
exposure to PBDEs in humans affect a) quantitative measures of
intelligence, or b) ADHD and attention-related behavioral con-
ditions?” The “Participants,” “Exposure,” “Comparator,” and
“Outcomes” (PECO) statement is briefly outlined below with
additional specifics available in our protocol.
Participants. The study? population was humans.
Exposure. The review examined studies of any developmen-
tal exposure to PBDEs that occurred prior to the assessment of
intelligence or ADHD and attention-related behavioral problems.
We decided in advance to include only studies that measured
PBDE exposure using biomarkers (i.e., measured in human bio-
logical samples) because these represent an integrated measure of
exposure from multiple sources (household dust, food, electron-
ics, textiles, etc.) and because of their demonstrated reliability
(Makey et al. 2014; Sjodin et al. 2004).
Comparator. Humans exposed to lower levels of PBDEs than
humans exposed to higher levels.
Outcomes. Any clinical diagnosis or other continuous or di-
chotomous scale assessment of a) quantitative measures of intel-
ligence, or b) ADHD and attention-related behavioral problems.
Data Sources
We searched the databases PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Biosis
Previews, Embase, Google Scholar, and Toxline on March 5,
2015, using the search terms shown in Table S1. We did not limit
our search by language or initial publication date. We used the
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) database to compile syno-
nyms for PBDE, IQ, and ADHD and attention-related behavioral
condition outcomes (Lam et al. 2015a). We updated the search
on September 27, 2016, to identify any new studies. We also sup-
plemented these results by searching toxicological and grey liter-
ature databases (See Table S2); consulting with subject matter
experts; and hand-searching references of included studies,
review papers on the topic, and references cited by and citing
included studies.
Study Selection
We included original studies that quantified PBDEs (in the form
of any individual congener or sum of multiple congeners) meas-
ured in human biological samples and reported associations with
either ADHD and attention-related behavioral problems or a
quantitative measure of intelligence. We screened references in
duplicate for inclusion using DistillerSR (Evidence Partners).
Two of four possible reviewers (N.D., L.D., J.M., P.S.) independ-
ently reviewed titles and abstracts of each reference to determine
eligibility. References not excluded were then independently
screened through full-text review by two of the same four
reviewers above. An additional reviewer (JL) screened 5% of the
titles/abstracts and full texts for quality assurance.
We excluded studies if: a) the report did not contain original
data; b) the article did not involve human subjects; c) there was
no quantitative measure of developmental PBDE exposure in
human biological samples; d) a study did not assess ADHD and
attention-related behavioral problems or a quantitative measure
of intelligence; or e) there was no comparator–control group or
exposure-range comparison (see Supplemental Material, “List of
Excluded Studies”). We used the term “attention-related behav-
ioral problems” or “conditions” or “outcomes” to represent a
spectrum of behavioral deficits that may be examined in epidemi-
ological studies of neurodevelopment and that have been identi-
fied in previous reviews as relevant to ADHD or attention (Eubig
et al. 2010).

 Data Extraction
We extracted data from studies in duplicate using a database
from DRAGON, an online data review and integration tool (ICF
International; available at: http://www.icfi.com/insights/products-
and-tools/dragon-online-tool-systematic-review). Two of three
authors (N.D., L.D., J.M.) and a University of California, San
Francisco, research assistant (H. Tesoro) independently extracted
data related to study characteristics and outcome measures (Table
S3) from each included article. A third author (J.L.) reviewed all
the studies to resolve any discrepancies between the two inde-
pendent extractors and further ensure the accuracy of extracted
data. We extracted all relevant estimates of association reported
in the article relating PBDE exposure (for any individual conge-
ner or sum of multiple congeners) with intelligence or ADHD
and attention-related behavior problems. For the meta-analysis
for intelligence outcomes, we extracted adjusted regression esti-
mates (for articles reporting multiple models adjusting for differ-
ent sets of covariates, we selected estimates from the fully
adjusted model, including the most confounders) and standard
errors or 95% confidence interval (CI) limits and standardized to
a continuous increment in exposure (i.e., per 1-unit increase in
log-transformed PBDE exposure) when possible. We contacted
11 of 15 corresponding study authors to request additional data
for both intelligence and ADHD-related outcomes missing from
their published articles and received usable data from seven
authors.
Rate the Quality and Strength of the Evidence
Assessing the risk of bias for each included study. We evaluated
risk of bias for each of the included studies using a modified
instrument based on the Cochrane Collaboration’s “Risk of Bias”
tool and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s
(AHRQ) domains (i.e., selection bias, confounding, performance
bias, attrition bias, detection bias, and reporting bias) (Higgins
and Green 2011; Viswanathan et al. 2012). Possible ratings for
each domain were “low,” “probably low,” “probably high,” or
“high” risk of bias, with customized instructions for each domain
based on the type of evidence anticipated beforehand (see
Supplemental Material, “Instructions for Making Risk of Bias
Determinations”). For example, we determined that for a study to
be rated “low” risk of bias for the confounding domain, the anal-
ysis must either adjust for all of the following confounders or
report that these confounders were evaluated and omitted because
inclusion did not substantially affect the results: HOME Inventory,
maternal age, maternal education, marital status, maternal use
of alcohol during pregnancy, maternal depression, household
income/poverty, gestational exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke, child sex, exposure to other neurotoxic agents (i.e., lead),
birth weight or gestational age, number of children in the home,
father’s presence in the home, preschool and out-of-home child
care facility attendance, psychometrician, location and language of
the assessment (see Supplemental Material, “Instructions for
Making Risk of Bias Determinations”). These confounders were
collectively identified in our protocol for inclusion prior to screen-
ing studies by review authors with subject matter expertise on
intelligence, ADHD, or PBDEs (DAA, BPL, JM) and with knowl-
edge gathered from the literature (Watkins et al. 2013).
Two of six possible review authors with subject-matter exper-
tise (D.A.A., B.P.L., P.S., D.B., J.M., J.L.) and one additional
consultant with subject-matter and risk-of-bias rating expertise
(P.I.J.) independently recorded risk-of-bias determinations for
each included study, separately by outcome. We also ultimately
reviewed risk-of-bias ratings for each study and across the body
of evidence as a group to develop consensus on the rationale for
all ratings and to ensure consistency in our ratings.
Statistical analyses. Prior to study selection, we developed a
list of study characteristics to identify studies suitable for meta-
analysis (i.e., study features, characterization of the study popula-
tions, exposure assessment method, and outcome assessment
method). An initial decision applicable for both outcomes con-
cerned a minimum age of children in a study at time of neurological
assessment. We decided that measurements of intelligence or
ADHD and attention-related behavioral problems that have been
measured at an early age (i.e., <4 y old) would not be combined in
meta-analyses with other studies measuring at later ages, because
some evidence from longitudinal birth cohort studies exists show-
ing that statistical associations for neurodevelopmental outcomes
are more detectable as children mature (Chen et al. 2014; Karagas
etal.2012; Rauhetal.2006). Wedecidedbeforehandthatstudiesof
Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) and McCarthy Scales of Children’s Abilities
(MSCA) (Levin 2011) were combinable if a) children included in
the study were selected from the general population and at least 3 y
old at the time of the assessment (for better accuracy of intelligence
measurement at older ages); b) exposure was measured in any bio-
logical matrix (i.e., maternal serum, cord blood, breastmilk, etc.) as
lipid-adjusted BDE-47 and/or a sum of congeners including at least
lipid-adjustedBDEs47,99,100,and153(themostcommonconge-

and
measurements in different biologic matrices are combinable when
adjustedforlipidcontent[e.g.,whenexposure isexpressedasnano-
grams of PBDE per gram of lipid)(Alaee 2016; Hites2004)]; andc)
exposure was measured during pregnancy or near birth. FSIQ and
MSCA tests are both standardized with mean scores of 100 and a
standard deviation of 15, so no rescaling was necessary to combine
scores from studies using MSCA with those from studies using
FSIQ. For studies repeating assessments as children aged, we
selected the latest assessment time point for inclusion in our meta-
analysis. We also identified beforehand that because Bayley Scales
of Infant Development (BSID) (Michalec 2011) are generally
administered to children too young for IQ testing, these measures
would be inappropriate to combine with estimates such as FSIQ or
MSCA.
For ADHD, we determined beforehand that it would be
appropriate to combine in a meta-analysis the studies that
reported ADHD total score (Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL),
Conners’ ADHD/Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM)-IV Scales (CADS) (Conners 2001), Parental
Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) (Goodman 1997)
if a) the children included in the study were selected from the
general population and were at least 4 y old at the time of the
assessment, and b) BDE-47 and/or a sum of congeners including
at least BDEs 47, 99, 100, and 153 was measured during preg-
nancy or near delivery.
Random effects meta-analyses were performed using the
DerSimonian-Laird method (DerSimonian and Laird 1986).
Statistical heterogeneity across study estimates in the meta-
analyses was evaluated using Cochran’s Q statistic (with p ≤ 0:05
as our cut-off for statistical significance) and I2 (Higgins and
Green 2011; Johnson et al. 2014; Koustas et al. 2014; Lam et al.
2014). For other outcomes that were not amenable to a meta-
analysis (i.e., due to insufficient number of studies or existence of
heterogeneity across study design), we displayed the estimates of
association in tables and considered these findings in the final rat-
ing of the overall body of evidence.
To investigate the effect that publication bias may have on
our meta-analysis, we quantitatively evaluated the potential effect
that a new study might have on changing the interpretation of our

Summary of criteria for downgrades
Final rating for
downgrades
Rationale
(A) IQ outcome
Initial Rating of human
evidence = “Moderate”
Risk of bias
Study limitations – a substantial risk of bias
across body of evidence
0
Risk of bias for studies of IQ was generally “low” or “prob-
ably low” across studies and domains. Studies that
received “probably high ratings” evaluated outcomes
related to IQ, such as infant/toddler assessments of intelli-
gence (i.e., Bayley Scales), and these studies were not
included in the meta-analysis that informed our final deci-
sion. As such, we agreed that these limitations within cer-
tain studies were not strong enough to warrant
downgrading for risk of bias across all studies.
Indirectness
Evidence was not directly comparable to the
question of interest (i.e., population, expo-
sure, comparator, outcome)
0
IQ outcomes were measured in humans and in populations
that are directly relevant to the population of the study
question, as outlined in the PECO statement.
Inconsistency
Widely different estimates of effect in simi-
lar populations (heterogeneity or variability
in results)
0
All estimates of associations reported in studies included in
the meta-analysis were consistently “positive,” (i.e., report-
ing increased decrements in IQ or MSCA with increasing
BDE-47 exposure). Confidence intervals overlapped
across all four studies and were similar in width except
Gascon et al. (2011), which had wider confidence inter-
vals (CIs) and also included the fewest subjects (n = 78).
Estimates from the meta-analysis indicate that statistical
heterogeneity was not present (I2 = 0%) and the combined
association estimate was statistically significant.
For the IQ studies not combinable in the meta-analysis, the
majority of estimates assessing BSID reported poorer out-
comes with increasing BDE-47 exposure, although one
study reported an association in the opposite direction
(but not statistically significant). Confidence intervals for
studies overlapped across studies evaluating the same
assessment tool and reporting the same association mea-
sure. We determined that the number of studies using the
same assessment tool at the same age and reporting simi-
lar association measures was small and thus the available
evidence, while not fully consistent across BSID studies,
did not provide strong enough evidence to warrant down-
grading for Inconsistency.
Imprecision
Studies had few participants and few events
(wide CIs as judged by reviewers)
0
We judged that the width of the CI around the estimate of
association from the meta-analysis was sufficiently nar-
row given the sample size and thus that the evidence did
not warrant downgrading for imprecision.
Publication bias
Studies missing from body of evidence,
resulting in an over or underestimate of
true effects from exposure
0
Number of studies included in the meta-analysis were too
small (i.e., <10) for a statistical evaluation of potential
publication bias. We identified findings from the grey lit-
erature through our comprehensive search, and many stud-
ies that reported findings that were not statistically
significant. Our quantitative analysis to determine what
measure of association would need to be reported by a hy-
pothetical new study to change our meta-analysis effect to
no longer be statistically significant or to move it in the
opposite direction minimized concern that an unpublished
null study would likely change our conclusion.
Summary of Criteria for Upgrading
Upgrades
Large magnitude of effect
Upgraded if modeling suggested confound-
ing alone unlikely to explain associations
with large effect estimate as judged by
reviewers
0
The overall effect size from the meta-analysis was quite large for
an environmental epidemiology study (3.70 decrement in IQ
per 10-fold increase (in other words, times 10) in PBDE expo-
sure—approximately half the association that has been reported
for lead exposure and IQ outcome), but not all reported effect
sizes are consistently large and we judged the magnitude of
effect not large enough to warrant upgrading the evidence.
Dose–response
Upgraded if consistent relationship between
dose and response in one or multiple stud-
ies, and/or dose response across studies
+ 1
There was evidence of a dose-response gradient reported in
some studies (Adgent et al. 2014), whereas other studies
reported significant differences for higher categories of
exposure compared to lower, but no statistically signifi-
cant trend across all categories (Herbstman et al. 2010;
Zhang et al. 2016). The results from our meta-analysis
reported a statistically significant decrement in intelli-
gence with increased PBDE exposure assuming a linear
relationship in studies with high relevance to the study
question. We felt this was convincing to assign a + 1
upgrade to the overall body of evidence.

Final rating for
upgrades
Rationale
Confounding minimizes
effect
Upgraded if consideration of all plausible re-
sidual confounders or biases would under-
estimate the effect or suggest a spurious
effect when results show no effect
0
We identified some studies that might have residual con-
founding because they did not account for all important
confounders as listed in the protocol. However, we did
not expect that omission of any of these confounders
would have led to underestimating our meta-analysis asso-
ciation estimate and therefore did not upgrade for this
consideration.
Overall quality of evidence
Moderate
Although we applied a + 1 rating for the “Dose–response”
consideration, we did not feel that the dose–response evi-
dence was strong enough to warrant upgrading the overall
quality rating.
Overall strength of evidencea
Sufficient
A positive relationship is observed between exposure and
outcome where chance, bias, and confounding can be
ruled out with reasonable confidence. The available evi-
dence includes results from multiple well-designed, well-
conducted studies, and the conclusion is unlikely to be
strongly affected by the results of future studies.
(B) ADHD outcome
Summary of criteria for downgrades
Downgrades
Initial rating of human
evidence = moderate risk of
bias
Widely different estimates of effect in
similar populations (heterogeneity or
variability in results)
0
Risk of bias was generally “low” or “probably low” across
studies and domains. Generally, the domain of confound-
ing was most frequently judged to be other than “low”
risk of bias; however, we did not judge that this warranted
downgrading for risk of bias across all studies.
Indirectness
Widely different estimates of effect in simi-
lar populations (heterogeneity or variability
in results)
0
ADHD-related outcomes are measured in humans and in
populations that are directly relevant to the population of
the study question, as outlined in the PECO statement.
Inconsistency
Widely different estimates of effect in simi-
lar populations (heterogeneity or variability
in results)
0
The majority of studies reported association estimates show-
ing increased risk of ADHD symptoms with increasing
PBDE exposures, although some studies did report associa-
tions in the opposite direction. Confidence intervals for stud-
ies overlapped across studies evaluating the same assessment
tool and reporting the same association measure. We deter-
mined that the number of studies evaluating the same assess-
ment tool at the same age and reporting similar association
measures was small and did not provide strong enough evi-
dence to warrant downgrading for Inconsistency.
Imprecision
Studies had few participants and few events
(wide CIs as judged by reviewers)
0
We judged that the width of the CI around the estimate of
association was sufficiently narrow given the sample size
and did not feel there was any reason to downgrade the
overall body of evidence for Imprecision.
Publication bias
Studies missing from body of evidence,
resulting in an over or underestimate of
true effects from exposure
0
Number of studies included was too small (i.e., <10) for a
statistical evaluation of potential publication bias. We
identified findings from the grey literature through our
comprehensive search, and many studies reported findings
that were not statistically significant
Summary of Criteria for Upgrading
Upgrades
Large magnitude of effect
Upgraded if modeling suggested confound-
ing alone unlikely to explain associations
with large effect estimate as judged by
reviewers
0
Studies that reported positive associations between expo-
sure and outcome were interpreted as primarily minimal-
to-moderate magnitudes; review authors judged that there
was insufficient evidence to upgrade for Large Magnitude
of Effect.
Dose–response
Upgraded if consistent relationship between
dose and response in one or multiple stud-
ies, and/or dose response across studies
0
There was not enough evidence to evaluate existence of a
dose–response relationship, primarily due to the small
number of studies and the heterogeneity in reporting of
effect estimates (i.e., Spearman’s Rho correlation coeffi-
cient, adjusted linear regression results, adjusted odds
ratios, adjusted incidence rate ratios, and adjusted relative
risks). We therefore concluded there was insufficient evi-
dence to warrant upgrading for dose–response.
Confounding minimizes
effect

sidual confounders or biases would under-
estimate the effect or suggest a spurious

0
We identified some studies that might have residual con-
founding because they did not account for all important
confounders as listed in the protocol. However, we did not
expect that omission of any of these confounders would
have led to underestimating the association estimate and
therefore did not upgrade for this consideration. There were
not enough combinable studies to perform a meta-analysis.

 overall results. Specifically, the association estimate of a new or
unpublished study necessary to alter the results of the meta-
analysis was calculated under two scenarios, so that a) the 95%
CI of the meta-analysis overlapped zero, b) the meta-analysis
central association estimate was greater than zero (moves to the
opposite direction—i.e., such that increases in PBDE exposures
would be associated with increases in intelligence). In making
this calculation, we assumed that the new hypothetical study
would have a standard error of 2.3, equal to the smallest in our
group of studies (Eskenazi et al. 2013).
Rating the quality of evidence across studies. We rated the
quality of the overall body of evidence as “high,” “moderate,” or
“low.”We assignedaninitialrating of“moderate” quality tohuman
observational studies based on the previously described rationale
(Johnson et al. 2014; Koustas et al. 2014; Vesterinen et al. 2014;
Woodruff and Sutton 2014), and then we considered potential
adjustments (“downgrades” or “upgrades”) to the quality rating
based on eight categories of considerations: risk of bias, indirect-
ness, inconsistency, imprecision, potential for publication bias,
large magnitude of effect, dose response, and whether residual con-
foundingwouldminimize theoveralleffectestimate(Balshem etal.
2011); the specific factors and instructions to review authors
considered are summarized in Table 1 and detailed in our pro-
tocol (Lam et al. 2015b). Possible ratings were 0 (no change
from initial quality rating), −1 (1 level downgrade) or −2 (2
level downgrade),
+ 1 (1 level upgrade) or
+ 2 (2 level
upgrade). Review authors independently evaluated the quality
of the evidence, and then compared ratings as a group, and
recorded the consensus and rationale for each final decision.
Rating the strength of the evidence across studies. We assigned
an overall strength of evidence rating based on four considera-
tions: a) Quality of body of evidence (i.e., the rating from the pre-
vious step); b) Direction of effect; c) Confidence in effect
(likelihood that a new study could change our conclusion); and d)
Other compelling attributes of the data that may influence cer-
tainty, e.g., specificity of the association when the outcome is
rare or unlikely to have multiple causes (NTP 2015). Possible rat-
ings were “sufficient evidence of toxicity,” “limited evidence of
toxicity,” “inadequate evidence of toxicity,” or “evidence of lack
of toxicity” (Table 2), based on categories used by the
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force, and U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) (IARC 2006; Sawaya et al. 2007; U.
S. EPA 1991, 1996). Review authors independently evaluated
the quality of the evidence and then compared ratings as a
group and recorded the consensus and rationale.

Strength rating
Definition
Sufficient evidence of
toxicity
A positive relationship is observed between exposure and outcome where chance, bias, and confounding can be ruled out with reason-
able confidence. The available evidence includes results from one or more well-designed, well-conducted studies, and the conclusion
is unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies.a
Limited evidence of
toxicity
A positive relationship is observed between exposure and outcome where chance, bias, and confounding cannot be ruled out with rea-
sonable confidence. Confidence in the relationship is constrained by such factors as: the number, size, or quality of individual stud-
ies, or inconsistency of findings across individual studies.a As more information becomes available, the estimated association could
change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion.
Inadequate evidence of
toxicity
The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects of the exposure. Evidence is insufficient because of: the limited number or size
of studies, low quality of individual studies, or inconsistency of findings across individual studies. More information may allow an
assessment of effects.
Evidence of lack of
toxicity
No relationship is observed between exposure and outcome, and chance, bias and confounding can be ruled out with reasonable confi-
dence. The available evidence includes consistent results from more than one well-designed, well-conducted study at the full range
of exposure levels that humans are known to encounter, and the conclusion is unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future
studies.a The conclusion is limited to the age at exposure and/or other conditions and levels of exposure studied.
Note: The Navigation Guide rates the quality and strength of evidence of human and non-human evidence streams separately as “sufficient,” “limited,” “inadequate,” or “evidence of
lack of toxicity” and then these two ratings are combined to produce one of five possible statements about the overall strength of the evidence of a chemical’s reproductive/develop-
mental toxicity. The methodology is adapted from the criteria used by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) to categorize the carcinogenicity of substances (IARC
2006), except as noted.
aLanguage for the definitions of the rating categories were adapted from descriptions of levels of certainty provided by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Levels of Certainty
Regarding Net Benefit.

An association is generally observed between exposure and
adverse outcome, but chance, bias, and confounding could
not be ruled out with reasonable confidence. Confidence
in the relationship is constrained by such factors as: the
number, size, assessment, measure of association or qual-
ity of individual studies, or inconsistency of findings
across individual studies. As more information becomes
available, the observed effect could change, and this
change may be large enough to alter the conclusion.
aDetailed instructions to authors on how to apply these criteria are presented in the Protocol, Appendix VII, Instructions for Grading the Quality and Strength of Evidence (Lam et al.
2015b). Language for the definitions of the rating categories were adapted from descriptions of levels of certainty provided by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Levels of

 added 716 unique records, of which an additional three studies
met the inclusion criteria (Cowell et al. 2015; Sagiv et al. 2015;
Zhang et al. 2016) (Figure 1). Of the 15 total included studies, 10
were relevant to the outcome of intelligence (Adgent et al. 2014;
Chao et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2014; Eskenazi et al. 2013; Gascon
et al. 2011, 2012; Herbstman et al. 2010; Lin et al. 2010; Shy
et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2016), and nine to the outcome of
ADHD and attention-related behavioral conditions (Adgent et al.
2014; Chen et al. 2014; Cowell et al. 2015; Eskenazi et al. 2013;
Gascon et al. 2011; Gump et al. 2014; Hoffman et al. 2012; Roze
et al. 2009; Sagiv et al. 2015). Included studies were published
from 2009 to 2016 and involved 35–622 study participants, for a
total of almost 3,000 mother–child pairs from eight populations
around the world (Table 3). All studies measured PBDE exposure
in maternal/child serum, cord blood, child whole blood, or breast-
milk and adjusted for lipid content (i.e., the units of exposure
were nanograms of PBDE per gram of lipids). The majority of
included studies adjusted for maternal age, sex of child, mother’s
parity, and some measure of socioeconomic status (Table 3).
Studies of Intelligence
Nine of 10 studies that evaluated intelligence were prospective
birth cohorts, and one was a cohort study that reanalyzed data
previously collected from a prospective birth cohort (Chao et al.
2011). Seven studies conducted assessments using BSID (Chao
et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2014; Gascon et al. 2012; Herbstman
et al. 2010; Lin et al. 2010; Shy et al. 2011) or Mullen Scales of
Early Learning (MSEL) (Adgent et al. 2014) at ages up to 36
months Five studies assessed FSIQ at ages 4 to 8 y (Chen et al.
2014; Eskenazi et al. 2013; Herbstman et al. 2010; Zhang
et al. 2016) or MSCA total cognitive score at age 4 y

 (Gascon et al. 2011). Studies measured PBDE exposure in
maternal serum or cord blood (n = 4), both maternal and
child blood/serum (n = 2), or breast milk (n = 4) (Table 3a).
One included study relevant to ADHD outcomes (Roze et al.
2009) also reported measuring outcomes related to intelli-
gence [Total and Performance Intelligence levels assessed
using a short form of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary
Scale of Intelligence, Revised Edition (WPPSI-R)] but did
not report estimates of association in the publication, and the
authors did not respond to requests for these data. Risk of
bias generally differed for studies evaluating IQ at a later
age and those evaluating children at younger ages. Studies of
FSIQ at a later age were consistently rated as “low” or
“probably low” risk of bias across domains. The only excep-
tion to this was Herbstman et al. (2010), which received a
rating of “probably high” risk of bias for incomplete out-
come reporting because of concerns regarding missing data.
In contrast, many of the studies conducted only at younger
ages utilizing the BSID were rated as “probably high” risk
of bias in one or more domains (Figure 2a and Tables S4–
S18). Four studies measuring BDE-47 in maternal serum
during gestation or at birth or cord blood at birth and assess-
ing FSIQ or MSCA in children 4–7 y old were amenable to
a meta-analysis (Chen et al. 2014; Eskenazi et al. 2013;
Gascon et al. 2011; Herbstman et al. 2010) (Table 4). The
meta-analysis reported an overall decrement of 3.70 IQ
points (95% CI: 0.83, 6.56; I2 = 0%; Figure 3) per 10-fold
increase (in other words, times 10) in lipid-adjusted PBDE
concentration (PBDE concentration range: <LOD–761 ng=g
lipid). Our updated search on September 27, 2016, identified
a newer study (Zhang et al. 2016) assessing the same cohort
of children as Chen et al. (2014) but at a later time point (8
y old instead of 5 y old). However, because Zhang et al.
(2016) assessed children at an older time point than the other
three studies included in our meta-analysis did (4, 6, and 7
y), we decided to keep Chen et al. (2014) in the meta-
analysis to stay within the age range at assessment. We per-
formed a sensitivity analysis replacing the Chen et al. (2014)
with Zhang et al. (2016) and found that the overall estimate
changed minimally from −3:70 to −3:52 (Figure S1).
Estimates of association from studies using the BSID were
extracted but could not be combined in a meta-analysis or visually
displayed collectively in a figure because estimates were reported
on different scales and used different association metrics (Table
5). Based on comparison of the body of evidence to prespecified
criteria, we concluded that the quality of the overall body of evi-
dence for the intelligence outcome was “moderate” (Table 1a); i.
e., the evidence did not warrant downgrading or upgrading.
We found some evidence of a dose–response gradient in sev-
eral studies. Eskenazi et al. (2013) reported a significant dose-
response trend across quartiles of the sum of BDE-47, BDE-99,
BDE-100, and BDE-153 in maternal serum in decreasing WISC

 verbal comprehension evaluated in children at age 7 y (p = 0:02).
Adgent et al. (2014) investigated the relationship across quartiles
of BDE-28, BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100, and BDE-153 in
breastmilk and reported similar small and imprecise estimates
that were generally in a positive direction for MSEL composite
scores. Herbstman et al. (2010) reported significant differences
for BDE-47 measured in maternal serum comparing the 25th to
75th percentile (IQR = 19:77 ng=g lipid) for FSIQ at when chil-
dren were assessed at 48 months, but not at 72 months. A dose–
response relationship was also supported by the results of our
meta-analysis (Figure 3) that demonstrated a statistically signifi-
cant decrement in intelligence with increased PBDE exposures,
assuming a linear relationship. However, Zhang et al. (2016)
evaluated trends for FSIQ across quartiles of prenatal exposures
to the sum of BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100, and BDE-153 and
reported significant differences comparing the third with first
quartile, but no overall trend (p = 0:11). We judged these collec-
tive findings to be not consistent or strong enough to warrant
upgrading the overall quality of evidence for dose response.
We rated the overall strength of the evidence as “sufficient”
for intelligence (Table 1a) based on: a) “moderate” quality of the
body of evidence; b) direction of the association (i.e., consistent
evidence of an inverse association between PBDEs exposure
with intelligence across studies and among the combination of
similar studies in the meta-analysis); c) confidence in the associa-
tion with multiple well-conducted studies (i.e., most studies) (all,
for those included in the meta-analysis) were prospective cohort
studies and were of “low” or “probably low” risk of bias overall;
the cohorts as a group represented geographically and socioeco-
nomically diverse populations (Tables 3 and 4); and a statistically
significant overall estimate of association from the combination
of similar studies in a meta-analysis (Figure 3).
We agreed that it was not possible to eliminate the possibil-
ity of publication bias, particularly because we did not find
enough studies to perform a formal statistical analysis for publi-
cation bias; however, we judged that the potential for risk of
publication bias was not enough to alter our conclusions. Our ra-
tionale for this judgment was based on a) having conducted a
comprehensive search that included the gray literature to iden-
tify government reports, conference abstracts, theses, and disser-
tations that may not have been subsequently published, in an
attempt to capture a comprehensive collection of studies; and b)
the results of our quantitative evaluation of the association esti-
mate that an unpublished study would have to have to change
our confidence in the estimate of our meta-analysis for intelli-
gence. Our analysis reported that to enlarge the CI of our meta-
analysis association estimate such that it would overlap zero, a
new or unpublished study would have to report 0.69 (95% CI:
−3:82, 5.20) increased IQ points per 10-fold increase in (in
other words, times 10) PBDE exposure (Figure S2a). We judged
the unpublished existence of a well-conducted study with such a
result to be unlikely, given that this association estimate was in
the opposite direction of all the other studies (including the four
prospective cohort studies included in our meta-analysis) and
would indicate that an increase in PBDE exposure would be
associated with an increase in IQ, which we thought, based on
current human and animal evidence, to be highly unlikely.
Further, this central estimate (0.69) represents an association
3.38 IQ points [per 10-fold increase (in other words, times 10)
in PBDE exposure] higher than the smallest association estimate
reported by studies included in our meta-analysis [−2:69 from
Herbstman et al. (2010)], and we judged it to be unlikely that an
unpublished study would report such a finding.

 To shift our meta-analysis to have an overall association esti-
mate of zero would require a new study reporting an estimate of
12.0 (95% CI: 7.49, 16.51) increased IQ points per 10-fold
increase (in other words, times 10) in PBDE exposure (Figure
S1). We concluded this to be highly unlikely, and as such, collec-
tively, these results increased confidence in our final rating of
“sufficient” evidence that PBDE exposure diminishes intelligence
even if the potential for publication bias could not be entirely
ruled out.
Studies of ADHD and Attention-Related Behaviors
Eight of nine studies that evaluated ADHD and attention-related
behaviors were prospective birth cohorts; the remaining study
(Gump et al. 2014) was a cross-sectional study that we decided
met our inclusion criteria because exposure was assessed a week
prior to evaluating the outcomes. Assessments of ADHD and
attention-related
behaviors
included
Behavior
Assessment
System for Children (BASC) (Adgent et al. 2014; Chen et al.
2014; Eskenazi et al. 2013; Sagiv et al. 2015), CADS (Eskenazi
et al. 2013; Sagiv et al. 2015), CBCL (Cowell et al. 2015;
Eskenazi et al. 2013; Roze et al. 2009), Conners’ Continuous
Performance Test (CPT) (Sagiv et al. 2015), DSM of Mental
Disorders (Gascon et al. 2011; Sagiv et al. 2015), Infant-Toddler
Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) (Hoffman et al.
2012), Kiddie Continuous Performance Test (K-CPT) (Eskenazi
et al. 2013), parental ADHD questionnaire (Roze et al. 2009), or
Parental SDQ (Gump et al. 2014) at a wide range of ages (2–11
y). Studies measured PBDE exposure in maternal serum or cord
blood (n = 3), both maternal and child blood/serum (n = 3), child
whole blood (n = 1), or breast milk (n = 2).
We rated most risk-of-bias domains as “low” or “probably
low” across all nine studies of ADHD and attention-related be-
havioral conditions (Figure 2b and Tables S4–S18). The most
prevalent instances of “high” or “probably high” ratings in the
body of evidence were for confounding and/or incomplete out-
come reporting (Adgent et al. 2014; Cowell et al. 2015; Gump
et al. 2014; Roze et al. 2009). For example, Roze et al. (2009)
received a “high” risk-of-bias rating for incomplete outcome data
because they reported only statistically significant results,
whereas Cowell et al. (2015) received a “probably high” rating
for this domain because reviewers had concern about missing
outcome data that could not definitively be ruled out as related to
participant’s exposure levels. Roze et al. (2009) also received
“probably high” ratings for the blinding domain because the
authors did not discuss blinding of outcome assessor to the expo-
sure of participants. Roze et al. (2009), Gump et al. (2014), and
Adgent et al. (2014) received “high” or “probably high” risk-of-
bias ratings for the confounding domain because they did not
adjust for all the important confounders that we determined
beforehand, and in particular lacked adjustment for maternal
characteristics (maternal age, education, marital status, exposure
to alcohol/smoking during pregnancy, etc.). Furthermore, Gump
et al. (2014) received a “high” rating for the “Other” category
because PBDE exposures were measured the week prior to
assessing ADHD outcomes, technically satisfying our inclusion
criteria of assessing exposures prior to outcome but raising some
concerns regarding whether the exposure truly preceded the
outcome.
Meta-analyses were not feasible because there were not
enough combinable studies. We assessed association estimates
related to ADHD outcomes (BASC-2, CADS, CBCL, DSM-IV,
K-CPT) by evaluating linear regression estimates from the fully
adjusted models for lipid-adjusted BDE-47 exposures measured
in cord blood, maternal serum, or breastmilk when available and
dichotomous/categorical/correlation estimates when continuous
estimates were not available (Table 6). We saw positive associa-
tions between PBDE exposures and ADHD or attention-related
behavioral effects generally, although data were limited and CIs
generally overlapped the null (Table 6). We agreed that the possi-
bility of publication bias could not be confidently eliminated, as
there were not enough studies to combine in a meta-analysis (and
thus quantify the size of the association estimate needed to
change our confidence in the meta-analysis estimate, as above for
IQ) or to perform a formal statistical analysis for publication
bias. However, we identified findings from the gray literature
through our comprehensive search, and many studies reported
findings that were not statistically significant. As such, we judged
that there was insufficient evidence to warrant downgrading the
body of evidence for publication bias.
The overall strength of the evidence was “limited” for the out-
come of ADHD and attention-related behaviors (Table 1b) based
on: 1) “moderate” quality of the body of evidence; 2) direction of
the effect, i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse effect with
increasing exposure to PBDEs existed, but it was not consistent
over all studies; and 3) confidence in the effect (multiple well-
conducted studies). Generally, given the limitations of the body
of evidence, overall chance, bias, and confounding could not be
ruled out with reasonable confidence.
Discussion
Understanding what puts children at risk for neurological disor-
ders is critical to preventing harm. To our knowledge, this study

 was the first systematic review and meta-analysis of developmen-
tal exposure to PBDEs. Our review found “sufficient evidence of
toxicity” based on diminished intelligence associated with
increased exposure to PBDEs, and “limited evidence of toxicity”
based on increases in ADHD and attention-related behaviors with
increased exposure to PBDEs. We identified nine reviews of this
topic published between 2003 and 2016 (Berghuis et al. 2015;
Brandt 2012; Chao et al. 2014; De Cock et al. 2012; Kim et al.
2014; Muir 2003; Pinson et al. 2016; Roth and Wilks 2014;
Vrijheid et al. 2016), none of which conducted a meta-analysis or
consistently applied all nine components of a systematic literature
review as described in the Literature Review Appraisal Toolkit
(LRAT), a tool derived from a number of standard practice
appraisals of the methodological quality of the literature reviews
conducted in the medical sciences (see http://policyfromscience.
com/lrat/) (Ades et al. 2012; Garg et al. 2008; Higgins and Green
2011; Moher et al. 2009; Mulrow 1987; Oxman et al. 1994;
Schulz et al. 2010; Shea et al. 2007). Broadly, our results that
PBDEs are associated with adverse neurodevelopment (either
directly or indirectly, e.g, as a thyroid hormone disruptor), were
generally consistent with the findings of all but one of the nine
reviews (Roth and Wilks 2014). That review concluded that the
available evidence “raises questions” but does not “support a
strong causal association” between PBDEs and adverse neurode-
velopmental and neurobehavioral outcomes in infants and chil-
dren (Roth and Wilks 2014). The authors of that study also did
not specify a definition of “strong causal association,” so it is not
possible to directly compare their findings with the findings from
our review. Possible explanations for the different conclusions
are that we performed a meta-analysis, which strengthened our
capacity to detect an association beyond individual study findings
or that Roth and Wilks (2014) did not include the Chen et al.
(2014) study that was included in our review (Chen et al. 2014).
We found an association of 3.7-point reduction in IQ per
10-fold increase (in other words, times 10) in PBDE exposure
when combining results from four prospective birth cohort
studies
investigating
PBDE
exposures
within
the
range
<LOD–761 ng=g lipid. In comparison, for the well-studied
adverse effects of lead on IQ, it has been estimated in a pooled
analysis of 1,333 children participating in seven international
population-based longitudinal cohort studies followed from
birth or infancy until 5–10 y of age that there is a 7-point
reduction in IQ per approximately 10-fold increase (in other
words, times 10) in child blood lead levels (6.9-point decre-
ment in IQ associated with blood lead level increase from 2.4
to 30 lg=dL) (Lanphear et al. 2005). Even mild decrements in
individual IQ can result in serious consequences at the societal
level (Bellinger 2012), and as such, these neurological health
effects are of great concern to public health. These results
underscore the importance of strengthening efforts to prevent
the widespread entry of potential neurotoxicants into the envi-
ronment and to remove PBDEs and other toxic industrial chem-
icals
that
have
become
ubiquitous
in
our
environment.
Although public health efforts to reduce lead exposures in the
U.S. have significantly reduced childhood blood lead levels
(Needleman and Gee 2013), strong policies and regulations are
still needed to eliminate lead exposures that persist in commun-
ities (Bellinger 2016) and in workplaces (Hipkins et al. 2004)
and to reduce other environmental chemical exposures also
associated with adverse neurodevelopmental risks (Bennett
et al. 2016).
Preventing the entry of toxic environmental chemicals into
the marketplace is critical: Once chemicals are released into com-
merce, exposures can persist long after the chemicals have been
“recalled.” Since 2003, several restrictions, phase-outs, and bans
on PBDEs have been implemented in the U.S., Canada, and
the European Union, reducing use of PBDEs (CDC 2013;
Environment Canada 2015; Council of the European Union,
European Parliament 2003; U.S. EPA 2014). However, human
exposure to PBDEs remains ongoing and widespread because
PBDEs were in commerce for over 40 y, and they persist in the
environment (Besis and Samara 2012; Fromme et al. 2016; Hites
2004; Law et al. 2008; Sjodin et al. 2008). Notably, PBDEs were
introduced as a substitute for polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs),
compounds that had been banned (Birnbaum and Staskal 2004),
also underscoring the need for policies that can ensure that
“safer” substitutes are less toxic than the replacement chemicals.
A key challenge to our review was that many of the included
studies were not combinable in a meta-analysis. Included ADHD
studies generally reported association estimates on different
scales or based on categories of exposures using different ranges,
or they evaluated the health outcome at different life stages and
with different assessment tools, leading us to conclude the data
were too heterogeneous to be combined. Thus, we found limited
evidence to determine whether there is a consistent relationship
between PBDEs and ADHD. Due to differences in the timing and
nature of exposure and outcome assessment, many of the intelli-
gence studies also were not combinable in the meta-analysis.
Having additional studies would have increased our statistical
power and the precision of our association estimate.

 The four studies combinable in a meta-analysis were selected
based on similarities in study design, timing of exposure and out-
come measurement, and intelligence assessment method, but
other aspects of these studies may have differed and could have
impacted study comparability. For instance, studies did not all
adjust for the same confounding variables, which could poten-
tially influence the comparability of association estimates across
studies. However, each of the studies in the meta-analysis was
rated as having either “low” or “probably low” risk of bias for
confounding, as each study adjusted for all or nearly all of the
key confounders identified in our protocol. Thus, we considered
differences across studies in the confounders that were adjusted
for to be minor and unlikely to have influenced the meta-analysis
findings. Reviewed studies also showed heterogeneity in the
assessment age, exposure matrix, and assessment tool used in
studies to derive the summary estimate of association in the
meta-analysis. However, we selected association estimates from
studies assessing children at similar ages using similar assess-
ment tools for intelligence and utilized lipid-adjusted measures
that could be combined even in measured in different exposure

 matrices and therefore concluded that this heterogeneity was
anticipated to be minimal and that scientific rationale existed for
combining these estimates. Furthermore, there was minimal sta-
tistical heterogeneity, supporting the appropriateness of combin-
ing these studies in a meta-analysis.
The inability to combine studies in a meta-analysis due to
lack of reporting in published studies is a challenge for system-
atic reviews in environmental health. The meta-analysis reported
for IQ would not have been possible without the cooperation of
study authors and their willingness and ability to provide addi-
tional data and information. To advance the capacity to conduct
robust systematic reviews in environmental health, key data
should be requested by journals when manuscripts are submitted
for publication. Several high-impact journals have adopted check-
lists for the reporting of elements necessary to describe studies
comprehensively and transparently, such as the ARRIVE guide-
lines for experimental animal studies (http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/
ARRIVE/) (Kilkenny et al. 2010) or Strengthening the Reporting
of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines
for strengthening the reporting of observational human studies
(http://www.strobe-statement.org/) (von Elm et al. 2008), which
can help to ensure that these details are available for incorporation
into future reviews.
Conclusion
We found an association of PBDEs with decrements on IQ [3.7-
point reduction in IQ per 10-fold increase (in other words, times
10) in PBDE exposure] and concluded that there was “sufficient”
evidence supporting an association between developmental
PBDE exposure and IQ reduction. Our findings suggest that pre-
venting exposure to PBDEs could help prevent loss of human
intelligence and, potentially, prevent other neurodevelopmental
disorders in children.
