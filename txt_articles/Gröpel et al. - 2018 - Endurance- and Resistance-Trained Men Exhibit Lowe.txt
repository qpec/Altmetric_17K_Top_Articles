Evidence shows that regular physical exercise reduces physiological reactivity to
psychosocial stress. However, previous research mainly focused on the effect of
endurance exercise, with only a few studies looking at the effect of resistance
exercise. The current study tested whether individuals who regularly participate in
either endurance or resistance training differ from untrained individuals in adrenal
and cardiovascular reactivity to psychosocial stress. Twelve endurance-trained men,
10 resistance-trained men, and 12 healthy but untrained men were exposed to a
standardized psychosocial stressor, the Trier Social Stress Test. Measurements of
heart rate, free salivary cortisol levels, and mood were obtained throughout the test
and compared among the three groups. Overall, both endurance- and resistance-
trained men had lower heart rate levels than untrained men, indicating higher cardiac
performance of the trained groups. Trained men also exhibited lower heart rate
responses to psychosocial stress compared with untrained men. There were no
signifi
cant group differences in either cortisol responses or mood responses to the
stressor. The heart rate results are consistent with previous studies indicating reduced
cardiovascular reactivity to psychosocial stress in trained individuals. These fi
ndings
suggest that long-term endurance and resistance trainings may be related to the same
cardiovascular benefi
ts, without exhibiting strong effects on the cortisol reactivity to
stress.

INTRODUCTION
The World Health Organization calls stress as one of the greatest health risks of the 21st century
(Leka et al., 2003). Regular physical activity has been identified as one means of effective prevention,
with convincing evidence of its protective effects against stress-related diseases (Gerber and Pühse,
2009; Goldstein, 2010; Li and Siegrist, 2012; Gerber et al., 2014). These benefits are mediated
through a number of mechanisms, including reduced reactivity of the sympathetic nervous
system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to psychological stressors (Hamer et al.,
2006; Sothmann, 2006). Specifically, physically active individuals typically show lower cortisol
increase (Rimmele et al., 2007, 2009; Klaperski et al., 2013, 2014), lower cardiovascular reactivity

Gröpel et al.
Physical Activity and Stress
(Crews and Landers, 1987; Spalding et al., 2004; Forcier et al.,
2006; Rimmele et al., 2007, 2009; Klaperski et al., 2013, 2014),
and more rapid cardiovascular recovery (Jackson and Dishman,
2006) to laboratory stressors when compared to their less active
counterparts.
The majority of studies that showed effects of physical
activity on adrenal and cardiovascular reactivity to psychological
stressors included aerobic exercises (endurance training) such
as jogging, biking, and long distance running, with only a few
investigations looking at effects of anaerobic exercises (resistance
training) such as weight lifting (cf. Klaperski et al., 2012).
Of the few studies that directly compared the two, Spalding
et al. (2004) found that individuals who participated in either
endurance or resistance exercise training for 6 weeks showed
lower cardiovascular responses to a cognitive stressor than
untrained controls, with endurance training yielding somewhat
stronger effects. Blumenthal et al. (1988, 1990) compared type-A
individuals who had completed a 12-week endurance program
with type-A individuals who had completed a 12-week resistance
training program. The authors observed greater reductions in
cardiovascular stress reactivity in the participants who completed
the endurance program. Although these studies appear to favor
endurance training over resistance training in reducing stress
responsiveness, the training time period might have been too
short for resistance training to demonstrate stronger effects.
Thus, evidence whether or not long-term resistance training has
the same psychophysiological benefits as long-term endurance
training is still missing from the literature.
The aim of this study was thus to test the effect of both
long-term endurance and resistance trainings on psychosocial
stress reactivity by including three groups differing in the type
of training (endurance-trained men, resistance-trained men, and
untrained controls). Several authors state that regular exercise
leads to physiological adaptations which contribute to a reduced
physiological reaction to stressors in general (Spalding et al.,
2004; Hamer et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2013; Klaperski et al.,
2013, 2014). Endurance training is known to enhance aerobic
capacity and to induce adaptations that increase ventricular
filling and decrease myocardial work, which in turn improve
cardiac performance (i.e., enhanced stroke volume) (Spalding
et al., 2004). This enables submaximal workloads to be negotiated
with greater efficiency (e.g., at a lower heart rate and blood
pressure; McArdle et al., 1996), resulting in less strain on
the cardiovascular system. Notably, these improvements may
generalize from ergogenic to psychogenic challenges (Sinyor
et al., 1983; Claytor, 1991). Similar to endurance training,
resistance training produces adaptations in the cardiovascular
system that lower blood pressure (Spalding et al., 2004) and cause
a more rapid return of heart rate to baseline levels following
physical exercise (Darr et al., 1988), even though aerobic capacity
does not increase as much (Spalding et al., 2004). In addition, in
trained weightlifters, Bush et al. (1999) documented a significant
increase in plasma peptide f (P-F) up to at least 240 min
following exercise, which signals immune response leading to
recovery from stress. Hence, although recent research related
to physical activity and stress responsiveness mainly focused
on endurance training, resistance training is likely to produce
similar positive outcomes (see Huang et al., 2013, for profound
discussion).
Based on the above evidence, we hypothesized that trained
men, both endurance and resistance, would show lower
endocrine and cardiovascular stress responses than untrained
men. Endurance-trained men engaged in regular training in long
distance running or biking for at least 1 year, whereas resistance-
trained men participated in regular training in weight lifting for at
least 1 year as well. Untrained men did not exercise regularly and
their physical activity was limited to casual use of the bicycle as
means of transportation. Psychosocial stress was induced by the
Trier Social Stress Test (TSST; Kirschbaum et al., 1993) consisting
of public speaking and a mental arithmetic task. Physiological
responses to the stressor were assessed by repeated measurement
of heart rate and free salivary cortisol levels. The level of baseline
cortisol regulation was controlled for through the measurement
of the cortisol awaking response (CAR).
In addition to physiological responses, we also measured
psychological responses to stress, such as positive and negative
mood. Even though psychosocial stress typically worsens mood
(Kuhl, 2001), Rimmele et al. (2007) reported larger mood
worsening in untrained men compared to trained men. Regular
physical activity has been associated with higher self-efficacy
(Netz et al., 2005) and self-efficacy has been associated with
lower anxiety and physiological stress reactivity (Bandura,
1997). Therefore, we hypothesized that endurance and resistance
trained men would show reduced mood worsening than
untrained men in response to the TSST.
Because stress responsiveness may at least in part depend
on personality traits (Kuhl, 2001), we controlled for action
orientation which refers to the individual ability to efficiently
cope with stress (Kuhl, 1994b). Individuals high in action
orientation are characterized by superior coping skills, including
the regulation of thoughts and emotions in favor of goal-
related actions, whereas individuals low in action orientation
are less resistant and prone to stick to adverse situations. In
comparison to student controls, athletes typically have higher
levels of action orientation (Beckmann and Kazén, 1994).
Moreover, we had previously shown that individuals high in
action orientation depict less increase in cortisol after a social
stressor than those low in action orientation (Quirin et al.,
2011). Therefore, we hypothesized that endurance and resistance
trained men would score higher in action orientation than
untrained men, and that the level of action orientation would
correlate with physiological and psychological responses to the
TSST.

Physical Activity and Stress
research investigating the effect of physical activity on stress
responsiveness (Klaperski et al., 2013, 2014).
The study sample comprised 12 endurance-trained men,
10 resistance-trained men, and 12 untrained men. All trained
participants were recruited by local sport clubs, fitness studios,
and through advertisements on regional web pages of endurance
sports and at the Osnabrück University, Germany. In a telephone
interview, we screened all participants for their weekly training
schedule (duration, intensity, and frequency) and their onset of
sportive activity in general. To be included, endurance-trained
men needed to be engaged in intensive training (at least
five scheduled units per week with at least one unit at a
minimum of 80% of the maximal efficiency) for at least
1 year. Resistance-trained men needed to train intensively
(at least four scheduled units per week with at least one unit
resulting in complete muscle fatigue) for at least 1 year, as
well. Untrained men were recruited through flyers at the
Osnabrück University. They had to not exercise regularly to
be included, and their physical activity had to be limited to
casual use of the bicycle as means of transportation. General
exclusion criteria were medication intake, reported medical
illnesses (diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and liver diseases),
psychological treatment, head trauma, substance abuse, and
smoking. All participants were native German speakers. This
study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations
of American Psychological Association with written informed
consent from all subjects. Before entering the study, all
participants gave written informed consent in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the
ethics committee of the Osnabrück University (#4/71040/0/6).
After the experiment, participants were paid €
25.
Procedure
The experimental session lasted for 2 h and took place between
13:00 and 16:00 h in order to control for diurnal variations
in cortisol levels (Dickerson and Kemeny, 2004). Participants
were asked to refrain from eating, drinking (except water), and
intensive physical activity for at least 1 h prior to the experiment.
Upon arrival at the laboratory, participants were connected
to a portable biosignal recorder for the electrocardiogram
recording (Varioport; Becker-Meditec Inc., Karlsruhe, Germany).
Following a baseline period of 30 min, in which participants filled
out questionnaires, participants were introduced to the upcoming
TSST task. The TSST is a standardized performance task protocol
which reliably and validly elicits large and robust HPA responses
(Dickerson and Kemeny, 2004). In this protocol, participants are
exposed to a 5-min public speaking task (mock job interview)
and a subsequent mental arithmetic task (serial subtraction)
performed out loud in front of a video camera and two judges
who keep a neutral expression throughout the task. Participants
were given 5 min to prepare for the mock-job interview in which
they were supposed to convince the two judges that they were the
most suitable candidate for a position of their choice. They were
also told that they would be videotaped for non-verbal behavioral
analysis to be conducted later.
After the preparation period, participants were guided to the
TSST room, where they stood in an upright standing position
in front of a camera and two experimenters in white coats
representing the judges. Participants were first asked to deliver
the job speech. If a subject stopped early, some seconds of
silence were kept and then a standardized catalog of general
questions was used in order to keep the subject talking (e.g.,
“
Which leadership qualities do you think you have?”
). Following
the speech, participants did the serial subtraction task: Starting
at the value 2010, they were asked to count down to zero by
serially subtracting the number 13 as quickly and accurately
as possible. Every time a mistake occurred, they had to start
over from 2010. After the 10-min stress protocol, participants
were guided back to the first room, where they were instructed
to sit quietly for 60 more minutes until saliva sampling was
completed and to fill in some additional questionnaires. Finally,
they were debriefed, received their compensation, and were
dismissed.
In addition to the experimental session, participants collected
saliva samples on the last 3 days before the test day. They were
instructed to take three saliva samples on the three consecutive
mornings prior to the test day immediately at awakening, 30 min,
and 60 min thereafter. Participants were also instructed not to
eat, to brush their teeth, and were only allowed to drink water
before completing saliva sampling to avoid contamination of
the sampling, and to refrain from sports in the 1st hour after
awakening. No other instructions were given that could interfere
with the participants’normal daily routines. The majority of
subjects typically show a marked cortisol increase of 50–
80%
within the first 30 min after awakening; a pattern known as
“
cortisol awakening response”(CAR; Schmidt-Reinwald et al.,
1999). Compliance with the saliva collection protocol was
electronically monitored (MEMS 6 TrackCap, AARDEX ltd.,
Zug, Switzerland). Of the total of 306 samples, 12 samples
(3.9%) were excluded because of non-compliance with the
protocol (e.g., large time period between two samples). Hence,
in general, participants were conscientious about meeting their
commitment.
Endocrine Measures
Salivary free cortisol is a reliable and valid measure of the
biologically active fraction of cortisol (Vining et al., 1983;
Kirschbaum and Hellhammer, 1994). Salivary free cortisol
gradually increases within about 10 min, and peaks around
10–
30 min after stressor cessation (Foley and Kirschbaum, 2010).
Saliva was collected using Salivette sampling devices (Sarstedt,
Rommelsdorf, Germany). Participants were asked to keep the
samples collected on the three morning prior to the test day in
their freezers and return them to the laboratory on their test day.
On that day, before and after the TSST, eight saliva samples were
collected from each participant. The baseline was calculated by
the mean of the first three samplings before the onset of the TSST
(−20, −10, −2 min), the endocrine response to the psychosocial
stressor was computed from the samples obtained after the onset
of the TSST (+15, +30, +45, +60, +75 min), resulting in six
repeated cortisol measures. Saliva samples were stored at −20◦C
and sent to the University of Trier (Germany) for biochemical
analysis of free cortisol concentration. Cortisol was analyzed
by a time-resolved immunoassay with fluorescence detection

Physical Activity and Stress
(Dressendörfer et al., 1992). Intra- and interassay coefficients of
variation were below 9.0%.
Autonomic Measures
Heart rate was monitored for subsequent 60-s segments using
a portable biosignal recorder (Varioport; Becker-Meditec Inc.,
Karlsruhe, Germany). For the baseline, four segments measured
10 min after the subject started to answer the questionnaires were
averaged. For the stress phase, nine consecutive 60-s segments
after the onset of the TSST were used. For the recovery phase,
the first 4 min after the TSST were averaged.
Psychological Measures
Action orientation was assessed with the two-dimensional Action
Control Scale (ACS-90; Kuhl, 1994a): the Demand-Related
Action Control subscale addresses how people cope with
upcoming difficulties and demands, and the Threat-Related
Action Control subscale focuses on coping with experienced
failures and threats. Perceived life stress was measured with
the
one-dimensional
Perceived
Stress
Scale
(PSS;
Cohen
and
Williamson,
1988)
that
addresses
unpredictability,
uncontrollability, overload, and general levels of experienced
stress during the last month. At the baseline and after the TSST,
positive and negative mood was repeatedly measured with the
Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson et al.,
1988). All questionnaires have been broadly used and have shown
satisfactory reliability and validity. The calculated Cronbach’
s
alphas show good internal consistency for the demand-related
and the threat-related subscales of the ACS-90 (α = 0.86 and
0.79, respectively), for the PSS (α = 0.81), and for the PANAS (all
αs > 0.70).
Statistical Analysis
Psychological and physiological data were analyzed using
two-way repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
group as the between-subject factor (3 groups: endurance-trained
men vs. resistance-trained men vs. untrained men) and time
as the within-subject factor (repeated measures: 3 for the CAR,
6 for cortisol at the test day, 11 for heart rate, and 2 for
positive and negative mood). Repeated-measures results were
verified with Greenhouse-Geisser corrections where the Mauchly
test of sphericity determined heterogeneity of covariance.
Group differences were determined using separate one-way
ANOVAs. Post hoc comparisons were performed with Bonferroni
adjustment. We additionally calculated the “
area under the
individual response curve with respect to the increase”(AUCI)
using the trapezoid formula (Pruessner et al., 2003), which allows
a sensitive measurement of changes over time (Hellhammer et al.,
2007). To test our prediction that trained men, both endurance
and resistance, would show lower stress responses than untrained
men, a contrast-coded test was conducted on AUCI in the case
that ANOVA revealed significant group differences. The contrast
to test this prediction was −0.5, −0.5, +1, which indicated lower
AUCI for trained men than untrained men. All statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS 24.0 (IBM Corp.; Armonk, NY,
United States). Data was preprocessed with scatterplots to detect
possible outliers; values that differed more than three standard
deviations from the mean were excluded. Data are presented
as mean ± SEM. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05
(two-tailed). Effect size was tested by the partial eta squared (ηp2)
which indicates the proportion of total variability attributable to
a factor.
RESULTS
Demographic and psychological characteristics of the three
groups are presented in Table 1. The groups did not significantly
differ in size, weight, and BMI (all p > 0.15). A significant
difference in age was found among the groups, F(2,31) = 5.91,
p = 0.01, ηp2 = 0.28. Resistance-trained men were significantly
younger than endurance-trained men (post hoc analysis, p = 0.01).
Untrained men did not differ in age from endurance-trained men
and resistance-trained men. Because of these group differences in
age, we additionally controlled for age in the following analyses.
Action Orientation
The groups differed significantly in demand-related action
orientation, F(2,30) = 8.65, p = 0.001, ηp2 = 0.37, but not
in threat-related action orientation, F(2,30) = 2.38, p = 0.11,
ηp2 = 0.14. For demand-related action orientation, the group of
untrained men differed significantly from both the endurance
group (post hoc analysis, p = 0.001) and the resistance group
(post hoc analysis, p = 0.04), showing lower values. The two
latter groups did not differ in the level of demand-related action
orientation (post hoc analysis, p = 0.80). Although trained and
untrained men differed in demand-related action orientation,

Physical Activity and Stress
the level of demand-related action orientation did not affect
stress responses in the present sample; it did not correlate with
either AUCI CAR, or AUCI cortisol, or AUCI heart rate or
differences in positive and negative mood from before to after
the TSST (p > 0.26). Similarly, threat-related action orientation
did not correlate with either CAR or physiological responses to
stress (p > 0.39). There was only a marginal correlation between
threat-related action orientation and differences in negative
mood from before to after the TSST which became significant
after controlling for age (rpartial = −0.37, p = 0.04), indicating
that, regardless of group, participants higher in threat-related
action orientation did not increase negative affect from before
to after the TSST as much as those low in threat-related action
orientation.
CAR and Chronic Stress
To test whether the groups differed in the CAR or in chronic
stress, three cortisol parameters were computed by averaging over
3 days: The mean cortisol level immediately after awakening, the
mean cortisol level 30 min after awakening, and the mean cortisol
level 60 min after awakening. The 3 days were not different
from each other before averaging. The CARs are depicted in
Figure 1. A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a main effect
of time, F(2,62) = 12.09, p = 0.001, ηp2 = 0.28, indicating a
significant increase in cortisol levels after awaking across all
groups. The groups did not significantly differ in the CAR (main
effect of group, p = 0.27; group by time interaction, p = 0.87).
Similarly, the groups did not differ in the AUCI CAR, p = 0.74.
In addition, there were no difference in self-reported levels of
perceived life stress among the three groups (p = 0.68; see
Table 1). The inclusion of age as covariate did not significantly
change the results. These results indicate that the study groups
did neither differ in basic regulation of the HPA, nor in the level
of chronic stress and thus any different responses to the TSST
between the groups cannot be attributed to differences on these
variables.

at awakening, 30 min, and 60 min thereafter in endurance-trained men,
resistance-trained men, and untrained men. Error bars are standard errors of
the mean (SEM).
Cortisol Responses to Stress
Cortisol values of one resistance-trained man differed more
than three standard deviations from the mean and his data was
therefore excluded from the analysis. The psychosocial stressor
induced a significant increase in salivary free cortisol levels in
all three groups, as illustrated by a significant main effect of
time, F(2.72,81.55) = 28.09, p = 0.001, ηp2 = 0.48. There were
no significant differences in cortisol levels between the groups at
baseline (p = 0.46). The group also did not differ in their cortisol
responses to the stressor, as indicated by an non-significant main
effect of group, F(2,30) = 2.65, p = 0.087, ηp2 = 0.15, and
non-significant group by time interaction, F(5.44,81.55) = 1.98,
p = 0.084, ηp2 = 0.12. Mean salivary cortisol levels are presented in
Figure 2. For cortisol increase (baseline to +75 min), a one-way
ANOVA with AUCI revealed no significant differences between
the groups (p = 0.10). The inclusion of age as a covariate revealed
the main effect of age, F(1,29) = 5.57, p = 0.03, ηp2 = 0.16.
Older participants showed stronger cortisol responses to the
stressor regardless of group. Controlling for age did not result
in significant differences in cortisol responsiveness among the
groups.
Heart Rate Responses to Stress
Heart rate at baseline differed significantly among groups,
F(2,31) = 5.91, p = 0.01, ηp2 = 0.28, with the lowest
heart rate occurring in the group of endurance-trained men
(69.04 ± 2.22 bpm), a medium heart rate in the group of
resistance-trained men (75.54 ± 2.43 bpm), and the highest
heart rate in the group of untrained men (79.76 ± 2.22 bpm).
Post hoc tests revealed that the endurance group’
s baseline
differed significantly from that in the untrained group (p = 0.01),
whereas the difference between the endurance and the resistance
groups and the difference between the resistance and the
untrained groups were not significant (p = 0.17 and p = 0.63,
respectively). The psychosocial stressor induced a significant
increase in heart rate in all three groups, as illustrated by a

psychosocial stressor (TSST, shaded area) in endurance-trained men,

significant main effect of time, F(3.62,108.53) = 44.84, p = 0.001,
ηp2 = 0.60. Furthermore, the average level of heart rate differed
between the three groups [main effect of group: F(2,30) = 7.62,
p = 0.002, ηp2 = 0.34], with untrained men having the highest
heart rate levels (post hoc analysis, p = 0.003 and p = 0.02 as
compared to endurance-trained men and resistance-trained men,
respectively). The endurance and resistance groups did not differ
significantly in heart rate levels (post hoc analysis, p = 1.00).
The group by time interaction was not significant (p = 0.22).
Mean heart rate levels are presented in Figure 3. For heart rate
increase (baseline to recovery), a one-way ANOVA with AUCI
revealed significant differences between groups, F(2,30) = 3.29,
p = 0.05, ηp2 = 0.18. Contrast-coded analysis (−0.5, −0.5, +1
for endurance-trained, resistance-trained, and untrained men,
respectively) was significant, t(30) = 2.53, p = 0.017, indicating
that lower heart rate increase was observed for trained men
than untrained men. However, the more conservative simple
post hoc tests (Bonferroni adjusted) were not significant. Here,
the untrained group had higher but non-significant heart rate
increase than the endurance group (post hoc analysis, p = 0.20)
and the resistance group (post hoc analysis, p = 0.07), whereas
the two latter groups did not differ from each other (post hoc
analysis, p = 1.00). The difference in statistical significance based
on which post hoc test is used is in line with some researchers
recommending the more conservative Bonferroni adjustment
(e.g., Bland and Altman, 1995; Greenhalgh, 1997), while others
argue against it because it favors the general null hypothesis and
considers important differences between pairs non-significant
(e.g., Perneger, 1998). The observed group differences remained
stable after including age as covariate in the above analyses.
Psychological Responses to Stress
Negative mood significantly increased from before to after the
stress protocol in all groups [main effect of time: F(1,31) = 17.01,
FIGURE 3 | Mean heart rates before, during, and after the psychosocial
stressor (TSST, shaded area) in endurance-trained men, resistance-trained
men, and untrained men. Error bars are standard errors of the mean (SEM).
p = 0.001, ηp2 = 0.36]. No significant differences were observed
between groups. Specifically, both the main effect of group
(p = 0.83) and the group by time interaction (p = 0.62) were
non-significant. Positive mood did not significantly change from
before to after the TSST (main effect of time: p = 0.10). The
main effect of group (p = 0.11) and the group by time interaction
(p = 0.86) were also non-significant. Neither controlling for age
or for action orientation resulted in significant group differences
in either positive or negative mood. Mean positive and negative
affect levels are presented in Table 2.
DISCUSSION
This study tested whether individuals who engage regularly
and long-term in either endurance or resistance training differ
from untrained individuals in adrenal, cardiovascular, and
psychological responses to a standardized psychosocial stressor.
We found that the psychosocial stressor (TSST) significantly
increased cortisol and heart rate responses, and worsened
negative mood in all three study groups. Only the pattern of heart
rate responses differed among the study groups, with untrained
men showing higher cardiovascular stress responsiveness than
trained men. Furthermore, the untrained group had significantly
higher heart rate levels during the test than both the endurance
and the resistance groups, whereas the two latter groups did
not differ significantly from each other. We did not observe any
significant group differences in cortisol and mood responses to
the stressor.
Prior research has demonstrated that long-term endurance
training is linked to lower cardiovascular responsiveness to
laboratory stressors (e.g., Rimmele et al., 2007, 2009; Klaperski
et al., 2013). Our data extend prior findings by showing that
long-term resistance training may be associated with the same
cardiovascular benefits. Both endurance-trained and resistance-
trained men had lower heart rate levels during the stress
protocol than untrained men, which may indicate overall
higher cardiac performance of the trained groups. In addition,
contrast analysis revealed that trained men (both endurance
and resistance altogether) exhibited significantly lower heart rate
responses to psychosocial stress compared to untrained men.

Physical Activity and Stress
The interpretation of that finding is limited by the observation
that using the more conservative Bonferroni adjusted pairwise
comparison between endurance-trained men and untrained men,
and between resistance-trained men and untrained men were no
longer significant. As pointed out in the results’section, this,
however, is by some considered a too conservative approach,
favoring the null hypothesis (Perneger, 1998). Nonetheless,
together our data provide some support for the protective role of
regular physical training (both endurance and resistance) against
stress.
The reported differences between trained men and untrained
men cannot be attributed to different levels of chronic stress,
or baseline HPA axis regulation. The study groups differed
neither in the CAR nor in self-reported levels of perceived
life stress. It is therefore unlikely that the lower responses
of trained men to the induced, acute stressor were due to
less stressful lives in general, or a changed baseline HPA axis
regulation, when compared with untrained men. In contrast,
it could be envisioned that trained men were more adapted
to acute stressors. The cross-stressor adaptation hypothesis
(Hamer et al., 2006; Sothmann, 2006) states that regular
exercise leads to biological adaptations which result in a
reduced reactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and the
HPA axis to stressors in general. This hypothesis has been
confirmed with experimentally induced stressors in a number
of studies (see Klaperski et al., 2014, for the most recent
overview). Thus, physical exercise may contribute to reduced
physiological reactions not only to exercise-related stressors but
also to psychosocial stressors (see also Sothmann, 2006; Gerber,
2008).
It is important to note that our data are partly in line
with the assumption of the cross-stressor adaptation hypothesis
with respect to cardiovascular reactivity, but to a lesser degree
with respect to endocrine stress reactivity. Trained men showed
significantly lower heart rate responses than the untrained group.
For salivary cortisol, however, the effects were non-significant.
Although both the endurance and the resistance groups showed
lower mean absolute increase in response to stress than the
untrained group, the group effect fell short of significance. The
mechanisms underlying this dissociation are unknown. Our data
merely mirror previous findings of relatively consistent effects
of regular physical activity on cardiovascular responses after
stress exposure (Forcier et al., 2006; Jackson and Dishman,
2006) but mixed results for endocrine stress responses (van
Doornen and de Geus, 1993; Rimmele et al., 2009). Rimmele
et al. (2009) suggest that the sympathetic nervous system (as the
main regulator of heart rate) is more sensitive to the adaptive
consequences of physical exercise than the HPA axis (as the
main regulator of cortisol). The current findings would provide
support for this differential effect as well. As we were studying
long-term effects of training on autonomic and cardiovascular
reactivity to stress, it is possible that initial reactivity differences
among the groups disappear over time for the HPA axis, but
not for the autonomic nervous system. To explore this possible
explanation further would require to test for an association
between training duration and reactivity in the endurance and
resistance groups. Unfortunately, this test was not possible as we
did not record the exact training duration of our participants
other than the requirement that training had to be ongoing for
at least 1 year. Thus, future studies should test for this possibility
specifically.
With regard to the psychological stress responses, negative
mood
was
intensified
significantly
in
response
to
stress
induction in all three groups.
However, there were no
differences observed among the groups. This is at odds with
previous findings by Rimmele et al. (2007) who reported
larger mood worsening in untrained individuals compared
to trained individuals. On the other hand, Rimmele et al.
(2009) found no group differences in negative mood worsening
with regard to the level of physical activity, and Klaperski
et al. (2013) reported even higher levels of negative mood
after stress exposure in physically active individuals compared
to inactive ones. So far, there is no existing explanation
for this inconsistent evidence. Prior research demonstrated
that physiological and psychological stress responses are not
automatically linked to each other. As reported by Campbell
and Ehlert (2012), significant correlations between self-reported
emotional stress variables and physiological responses measured
by heart rate and saliva cortisol emerged in less than
30% of 49 analyzed TSST studies. Future research is thus
needed to find out moderating variables responsible for the
dissociation between physiological and psychological stress
responses.
We also controlled for action orientation in this study
because action orientation might be related to both exercise
level (Beckmann and Kazén, 1994) and stress responsiveness
(Kuhl, 2001). In line with prior research (Beckmann and Kazén,
1994), physically trained men were more action-oriented than
untrained men, but only with regard to the demand-related
form of action orientation. Demand-related action orientation
reflects personality differences in self-motivation (Kuhl, 1994b;
Gröpel et al., 2014), which is of particular importance for
regular exercise (Kendzierski, 1990). Kendzierski found that
individuals high in demand-related action orientation exercised
more regularly than those low in action orientation, as they
were more able to overcome initial unwillingness, increases
in demands, and tiredness. However, demand-related action
orientation in the present study did not correlate with any
measure of stress responsiveness. Thus, higher demand-related
action orientation may be related to more regular exercise
training but does not seem to moderate exercise-related
benefits.
Some limitations deserve mention. As we used a cross-
sectional study design, no causal conclusions can be drawn.
Prospective longitudinal studies are necessary in this regard.
Despite the specific prerequisites which qualified either for
the endurance or the resistance group, it is unlikely that the
endurance group never engaged in resistance training and the
resistance group never engaged in endurance training. Every
ambitious athlete needs to train both endurance and resistance to
a certain extent. Thus, to separately test the effects of endurance
and resistance exercise, long-term experimental studies with
manipulations of the type of exercise are needed. Further, with
10–
12 subjects per group, we might be on the lower side of

detecting an effect. Finally, the generalizability of our results
is limited to healthy young men. Replications with other
samples would provide more insight into the influence of
gender, age, and clinical factors on exercise-related stress
adaptations.
CONCLUSION
We
examined
stress
responsiveness
of
individuals
who
participated regularly in either a long-term endurance or
resistance training. Our results partly support the importance
of
regular
exercise
regardless
of
the
type
of
exercise.
Specifically, the data suggest that both endurance and resistance
exercises, when performed over a longer period of time,
may increase cardiac performance and reduce cardiovascular
reactivity to acute psychosocial stress. Thus, regular physical
activity seems to have health-promoting effects, regardless
of whether it includes endurance exercise such as jogging,
walking or biking, or resistance exercise such as lifting
weights.
