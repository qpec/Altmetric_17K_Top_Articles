igh blood pressure is the leading cause of preventable 
morbidity and mortality globally.1 Yet control of blood 
pressure is poor, with only 1 in 3 people on treatment achiev-
ing blood pressure targets.2–5 The largest global survey of 
hypertension practice showed that while 88% of those aware 
of hypertension receive some pharmacological treatment, only 
34% of those treated were controlled. Overall, 61% of those 
treated only received monotherapy5 even though combination 
therapy is usually required to achieve acceptable levels of 
blood pressure control.6 In the absence of more effective new 
blood pressure drug classes, better blood pressure control is 
likely to require more use of existing agents in combination.
Minimization of side effects is critical for long-term treatment 
of a largely asymptomatic condition such as high blood pressure. 
Several studies suggest that low-dose combinations may provide 
the best ratio of side effects to blood pressure reduction, because 
at low doses most side effects are avoided and most benefit is 
realized.7 Given that blood pressure dose–response gradients are 
typically shallow above quarter standard dose,7 combinations 
containing quarter doses of several antihypertensive agents may 
be of particular benefit. One small trial reported in 2007 a large 
blood pressure reduction from quadruple quarter-dose combi-
nation therapy compared with monotherapy,8 and a small trial 
recently completed also showed large reductions compared with 
Abstract—There is a critical need for blood pressure–lowering strategies that have greater efficacy and minimal side effects. 
Low-dose combinations hold promise in this regard, but there are few data on very-low-dose therapy. We, therefore, 
conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials with at least one quarter-dose and one 
placebo and standard-dose monotherapy arm. A search was conducted of Medline, Embase, Cochrane Registry, Food and 
Drug Administration, and European Medicinal Agency websites. Data on blood pressure and adverse events were pooled 
using a fixed-effect model, and bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias. The review included 42 trials involving 
20 284 participants. Thirty-six comparisons evaluated quarter-dose with placebo and indicated a blood pressure reduction 
of −4.7/−2.4 mm Hg (P<0.001). Six comparisons were of dual quarter-dose therapy versus placebo, observing a −6.7/ −4.4 
mm Hg (P<0.001) blood pressure reduction. There were no trials of triple quarter-dose combination versus placebo, but 
one quadruple quarter-dose study observed a blood pressure reduction of −22.4/−13.1 mm Hg versus placebo (P<0.001). 
Compared with standard-dose monotherapy, the blood pressure differences achieved by single (37 comparisons), dual (7 
comparisons), and quadruple (1 trial) quarter-dose combinations were +3.7/+2.6 (P<0.001), +1.3/−0.3 (NS), and −13.1/−7.9 
(P<0.001) mm Hg, respectively. In terms of adverse events, single and dual quarter-dose therapy was not significantly 
different from placebo and had significantly fewer adverse events compared with standard-dose monotherapy. Quarter-dose 
combinations could provide improvements in efficacy and tolerability of blood pressure–lowering therapy.  (Hypertension.

placebo.9 We, therefore, conducted a systematic review of ran-
domized trials of quarter-dose blood pressure–lowering agent(s) 
to place these trials in the context of all evidence concerning 
quarter-dose therapy and to assess the potential clinical role of 
quarter-dose monotherapy and combination therapy.
Methods
The review methods are detailed in the protocol (online-only Data 
Supplement) and were written in accordance with the preferred Cochrane 
Collaboration–reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
Electronic searches were conducted in EMBASE (inception to June 
2016), MEDLINE (inception to June 2016), Cochrane Central Registry 
of Controlled Trials (inception to June 2016) and the Food and Drug 
Administration and European Medicines Agency websites. Searches 
of trial registers were performed for any ongoing trials including World 
Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, 
Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Register, and Clinical Trials 
Registry – India. Retrieval of studies from reference lists of key clinical 
trials, systematic reviews, and published articles was also undertaken. The 
Medline search has been included in the online-only Data Supplement).
During the initial phase of the search, 2 reviewers (A.B., M.C.) inde-
pendently performed the searches assessing titles and abstracts, exclud-
ing any studies that did not qualify. Both the reviewers then inspected 
the full text of those selected articles identified in the initial phase. A 
third reviewer (A.R.) resolved any disagreement on the included articles.
Types of Studies
Randomized controlled trials (either parallel or crossover) with a 
treatment and follow-up of at least 2 weeks were sought. Uptitration 
studies must have had blood pressure or safety data for at least the 
first 2 weeks before titration occurred. Studies were included only if 
there were efficacy or safety data that were measured for at least 1 of 
the 5 major classes of blood pressure–lowering medications: calcium 
channel blockers, β-blockers, angiotensin receptor II antagonists, 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,  and thiazide diuretics 
(TZs). All included medications were registered for use by the Food 
and Drug Administration or European Medicines Advisory and indi-
cated for the treatment of hypertension.
Studies were eligible for inclusion if participants were ≥18 years of 
age and written and published in English. No study was excluded on 
the basis of baseline blood pressure, presence or absence of disease, or 
year performed. Studies were only considered if at least one arm was 
allocated quarter-dose therapy (with one or multiple agents) and at 
least one arm allocated placebo or standard-dose monotherapy (to al-
low comparison with the 2007 trial8). In this review, the standard dose 
was defined as the most reported usual maintenance dose recorded 
by the British National Formulary, Martindale and Monthly Index of 
Medical Specialties, similar to the method of Law et al.7 The World 
Health Organization Defined Daily Dose was used as a tiebreaker if 
no consensus was found. If there was still no consensus between the 
selected pharmacopoeias, the most reported dose was judged as the 
standard dose (Table 1). However, there were 2 exceptions. A quarter 
dose of hydrochlorothiazide of 6 and 5 mg were used for the studies 
by Jounela et al10 and Pool et al11 because there was no 6.25 mg arm.
Efficacy was assessed using the mean absolute difference between 
the intervention and control deltas (mean changes in systolic blood 
pressure [SBP] and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] from baseline to 
end of study). Safety was defined as adverse events (all and side ef-
fect related, as defined by each trial) at follow-up, and change in bio-
chemical data (potassium and uric acid) from baseline to follow-up.
Data Extraction and Risk of Bias
Two reviewers (A.B. and M.C.) independently extracted data using 
a standard extraction form. The variables extracted included study 
design, sample size, mean age, percentage of female patients, ran-
domization, blinding, intervention, dose(s), follow-up, percent lost 
to follow-up, and study outcomes. In studies where numeric blood 
pressure changes were not presented (n=5), a visual estimate was 
made based on the figures provided. Both reviewers independently 
estimated the difference, with the average of the 2 being used.
The 2 reviewers (A.B. and M.C.) also independently assessed the 
risk of bias in each trial based on the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of 
bias tool12 (Figure S8 in the online-only Data Supplement). This esti-
mates the risk based on sequence generation, allocation concealment, 
selective outcome reporting, potential threats to validity, blinding of 
participants, personnel and outcome assessors, and incomplete data. 
The risk of bias in each included trial was reported as low, unclear, or 
high. A third reviewer (A.R.) resolved any differences.
Data Analysis
One reviewer (A.B.) entered the data into Microsoft Excel and then 
into the Comprehensive Meta-analysis Software.13 A second reviewer 
(H.-M.D.) checked the data for accuracy with a third reviewer (A.R.) 
resolving any disagreements. The data were analyzed according to 
intention to treat when possible. Binary outcomes were analyzed 
using the Mantel–Haenszel approach and summarized as risk ratios 
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Continuous outcomes were 
summarized as difference in means with 95% CIs. Individual trial 
results were pooled using fixed-effect meta-analysis with inverse 
variance weighting. Heterogeneity was quantified by Q test, I2, and 
τ statistics14,15 (Table S2). Publication bias was assessed and reported 
using a funnel plot (Figure S6).
Given the role of baseline blood pressure in determining the extent 
of blood pressure reduction from blood pressure–lowering drugs16 
and because there was heterogeneity across trials in mean baseline 
levels, blood pressure was standardized to that expected from a base-
line of 150/95 mm Hg. This involved a 0.1 mm Hg reduction in a giv-
en study’s SBP change score for each mm Hg baseline SBP over 150 
mm Hg, and a 0.1 mm Hg increase for each mm Hg baseline SBP be-
low 150 mm Hg. Similarly, 0.11 mm Hg was subtracted or added for 
each mm Hg DBP above or below 95 mm Hg.16 If no baseline blood 
pressure was reported for a given trial, then for that comparison, the 
mean of the included trials was used.
To analyze all randomized comparisons of quarter-dose therapy 
versus placebo and versus standard-dose monotherapy, some partici-
pants contributed to more than one analysis, and not all comparisons 
within multiarm trials were included. For example, Frishman et al17 
conducted a 4×3 factorial dose–response trial of 2 agents, with 12 
cells labeled A through L in Table 2.
These cells contributed to the different analyses as shown in 
Table 3.
Variability data were absent in 12 trials, in which cases the SD 
was imputed as a pooled SD derived from other trials with similar 
study arms.18 Although not ideal, this approach has been used in 
such occasions as outlined by the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic 
Reviews of Interventions.19 All biochemical data reported had miss-
ing variability data, and, thus, a common SD was used, derived for 
potassium from the ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering 
Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack)20 and for uric acid from the review 
by Weidmann.21 Meta-regression was used to undertake subgroup 
analysis of the effect that age and treatment period (>6 weeks) had 
on efficacy. Also, 3 sensitivity analyses were undertaken, to compare 
fixed-effect versus random-effects models, standardized versus non-
standardized blood pressure differences, and the impact of imputation 
for studies with missing variability data.
Results
Search Results
The initial search identified 1730 studies, with 1554 screened 
after exclusion of duplicate citations (Figure 1). Fifty-eight stud-
ies with extractable data met the inclusion criteria, and 16 studies 
were excluded after full-text evaluation. A total of 42 studies were 
included in the meta-analysis (online-only Data Supplement).

trials had eligibility criteria based solely on DBP. Of the 42 
studies, 38 reported quarter-dose monotherapy, 7 reported dual 
quarter-dose combination therapy, and 2 reported quadruple 
quarter-dose therapy compared with either placebo or each 
component at a standard dose. Follow-up ranged from 4 to 12 
weeks, averaging 7 weeks. Most studies were dose–response 
trials testing 3 to 4 doses of one agent versus placebo. Fourteen 
trials ( included trials 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 
34, 35, and 37, for more details, please see online-only Data 
Supplement) were factorial dose–response trials, testing sev-
eral doses of 2 agents. Only 1 out of the 42 studies did not have 
at least one arm containing standard-dose monotherapy, and 
all but 2 included a placebo control arm. Overall, there were 
20 284 participants with a mean age of 54 years, 61% were 
men, and mean baseline blood pressure was 154/101 mm Hg.
Efficacy
Quarter-Dose Therapy Versus Placebo
The efficacy in blood pressure lowering of single quarter-dose 
therapy versus placebo was assessed in 4721 participants in 
36 trials (Figure 2). Overall, placebo-corrected single quarter-
dose therapy reduced blood pressure by −4.7 (95% CI, −5.4

was still no consensus between the selected pharmacopoeias, the lowest, most reported, dose was judged as the 
standard dose. ACE indicates angiotensin-converting enzyme; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; BNS, British National

to −3.9)/−2.4 (−2.8 to −1.9) mm Hg. There was broad consis-
tency in treatment effect across the 5 major treatment classes 
(I2 SBP: 3, DBP: 0), and each was separately significant except 
for calcium channel blockers.
Six trials measured the efficacy of dual quarter-dose ther-
apy compared with placebo (Figure 2). All but one trial used 
a TZ diuretic in the dual quarter-dose combination. In the 312 
participants assessed, the effect of the dual quarter-dose com-
bination was an overall blood pressure drop of −6.7 (−8.6 to 
−4.8)/−4.4 (−5.5 to −3.3) mm Hg. There was some evidence of 
heterogeneity present across the different dual combinations 
(I2 SBP: 18, DBP: 37). No studies measured triple quarter-dose 
therapy versus placebo. One study (included trial 40, for more 
details, please see online-only Data Supplement) measured 
efficacy of quadruple quarter-dose therapy versus placebo and 
showed an office blood pressure reduction of −22.4 (−28.3 to 
−16.5)/−13.1 (−17.3 to −8.8; Figure 2). This was the only trial 
to report effects on 24-hour blood pressure profile, with reduc-
tions in 24 hour, day-time, and night-time BP of −18.7/−14.2, 
−22.3/−15.3, and −10.4/−12.5 mm Hg, respectively.
Quarter-Dose Therapy Versus Standard-Dose 
Monotherapy
Figure 3 illustrates the comparisons of single, dual, and quadruple 
quarter-dose therapy compared with standard-dose monotherapy 
on blood pressure reductions. Single quarter-dose therapy was 
less efficacious than standard-dose monotherapy by 3.7 (3.0–
4.5)/2.6  (2.2–3.1) mm Hg (I2 SBP: 24.3; DBP: 10.2). Dual quar-
ter-dose therapy showed an equivalent blood pressure–lowering 
effect compared with standard-dose monotherapy. Only one 
study8 assessed blood pressure lowering with quadruple quarter-
dose therapy versus standard-dose monotherapy and showed a 
substantially greater blood pressure reduction in the quarter-dose 
group of −13.1 (−20.1 to −6.1)/−7.9 (−12.1 to −3.7) mm Hg.
Safety and Tolerability
Adverse Events
Fifteen studies provided data on adverse events. Overall, com-
pared with placebo, no significant difference in the risk of 
adverse events in the 14 single quarter-dose comparisons (rela-
tive risk, 1.0 [0.91–1.2], I2: 20.8). This was also observed in 6 
dual quarter-dose comparisons (0.93 [0.29–2.9]) and in a soli-
tary quadruple (2.0 [0.2–20.2]) quarter-dose placebo compari-
son (Figure 4). Moreover, no individual medication class was 
associated with a greater risk of adverse events compared with 
placebo. Both single and dual quarter-dose therapy produced 
significantly fewer adverse events than standard-dose mono-
therapy (Figure 4). In terms of tolerability of quadruple quarter-
dose therapy, in the 2007 trial compared with standard-dose 
therapy, the only information available was that therapy was 
well tolerated by all of the participants, and, in particular, there 
was no case of hypotension.(J. Feely, personal communication). 
In the 2017 trial, no patient withdrew because of side effects.9 
However, in each trial, treatment was for only 4 weeks and a 
total of 40 patients received quadruple quarter-dose therapy.
Biochemical Adverse Effects
Table 4 compares the mean difference from baseline to fol-
low-up in biochemical measures, for placebo, single quarter-
dose, dual quarter-dose, and standard-dose therapy. Overall, 
data on potassium concentrations were reported in 10 studies; 
of these, 8 were amenable to pooling. Compared with placebo, 
none of the single (n=5), dual (n=3), or quadruple (n=1) quar-
ter-dose therapy comparisons showed a significant difference 
in potassium concentration. Treatment with TZ standard-dose 
monotherapy (n=4) resulted in a significantly greater reduc-
tion in potassium concentration compared with single quarter-
dose TZ, dual quarter β-blockers+quarter TZ and dual quarter 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor+quarter TZ. Similar 
trends were seen in 2 trials reporting the proportion of patients 
below a certain potassium level (<3.5 mmol/L)22 or the num-
ber of participants who developed a >0.05 mmol change in 
potassium concentration.23
Three studies reported data on uric acid concentrations in 
a format that allowed the data to be pooled. Compared with 
placebo, no significant differences were observed for single 
or dual quarter-dose treatment arms; however, quadruple 
quarter-dose therapy did result in a small increase compared 
with placebo (0.03, 95% CI, 0.001–0.04 mmol/L; P=0.003). 
Standard-dose TZ resulted in greater uric acid concentration 
versus single quarter-dose TZ, versus dual quarter angioten-
sin receptor II antagonists+quarter TZ and versus dual quar-
ter β-blockers+quarter TZ. These findings are comparable to 
one trial that only reported percentage change from baseline.24 
There was a also a small difference in creatinine compared with 
quadruple quarter-dose therapy compared with placebo (4.4, 
95% CI, 0.9–7.8 mmol/L; P=0.02), but no patient had more 
than a 12% increase.9
Effects on heart rate were generally not reported but were 
available for both quadruple quarter-dose combinations: Chow 
et al,9 reported a reduction of 6.5 bpm (95% CI, 2.3–10.6) 
compared with placebo and Mahmud and Feely8 reported a 
reduction from baseline of 6 SD 3 bpm.
Quality of Evidence
The Trim and Fill approach did not suggest evidence of publi-
cation bias (Figure S6). The risk of bias was assessed in all 42 
studies (Figure S8). Overall, 8 studies described the method of

sequence generation; 7 described the method of concealment 
and 28 described and dealt with missing data. In the absence of 
detailed study protocols, it was not possible to assess whether 
outcomes were selective. Likewise, other potential threats to 
validity could not be assessed. Blinding of participants and 
personnel was undertaken in some capacity for 41 trials (40 of 
which were double-blinded, 1 single blinded, and 1 open label).
Subgroup Analyses
Subgroup analyses undertaken using meta-regression did not 
suggest any significant correlation between DBP lowering and 
age (P=0.38) or >6 week treatment (P=0.18; Figure S7).
Sensitivity Analyses
The mean blood pressure reduction for a single quarter dose 
versus placebo was essentially the same using the random-
effects model (−4.7 [−5.4 to −3.9]/−2.3 [−2.8 to −1.9] mm Hg), 
compared with the fixed-effect model (−4.7 [−5.4 to −3.9]/−2.4 
[−2.8 to −1.9] mm Hg). Exclusion of studies with missing data 
on variability also did not substantially affect this estimate 
(−5.0 [−5.7 to −4.2]/−2.4 [−2.9 to −1.8] mm Hg). Finally, pool-
ing of nonstandardized changes in blood pressure, rather than 
changes standardized to a baseline blood pressure of 150/95 
mm Hg provided an overall estimate of −5.0 (−5.8 to −4.3)/−2.9 
(−3.4 to −2.3) mm Hg for quarter-dose therapy versus placebo.
Discussion
This review is the first to compare quarter-dose therapy to 
both standard dose and placebo and indicates a potential 
clinical advantage in terms of reducing side effects and, with 
the use of quadruple combinations, increasing efficacy. Single 
quarter-dose therapy reduced blood pressure by ≈−4.7/−2.4 
mm Hg compared with placebo (about half as much as stan-
dard-dose monotherapy), with no apparent side effects. Dual 
quarter-dose therapy had about the same efficacy as standard-
dose monotherapy, with fewer side effects. The data on qua-
druple quarter-dose therapy was limited to 2 small trials that 
indicated that these combinations are significantly more effi-
cacious than placebo and standard-dose monotherapy. A clear 
dose response in efficacy was seen between single, double, 
and quadruple quarter-dose therapy.
Strengths and Weaknesses of the Study
This review has several strengths. It was conducted in line with 
recommended systematic review methodology and included a 
relatively large number of studies, doubling the number of tri-
als of quarter-dose therapy included in a previous systematic 
review.9 Several studies were identified in regulatory submis-
sions that had not been published in the medical literature. The 
large number of trials allowed precise estimates of treatment 
effects, at least for single and dual combinations, and assess-
ment of consistency of results across major drug classes. The 
review also has some limitations. We did not review non–
English language trials. No individual-patient data were used, 
and data were not checked with original trialists because most 
trials were completed more than 17 years ago. There were 
some missing data, particularly on variability, but sensitiv-
ity analyses did suggest the findings were reasonably robust.

Only one trial assessed effects on 24-hour BP profile, and it 
remains unknown whether better night-time BP reduction can 
be achieved with different components. Finally, defining stan-
dard-dose–involved some assumptions, but to minimize their 
impact, the authors used data from 4 pharmacopoeias.
Context of Other Evidence
Law et al undertook the most relevant previous review in 2003, 
which assessed placebo-controlled trials of blood pressure–
lowering drugs available at that time.7 The principal aim of 
that review was to quantify effects of standard doses of blood 
pressure–lowering agents and dose response. Analysis of 
low-dose therapy was largely restricted to half dosages, indi-
cating that half-dose blood pressure treatment was ≈80% as 
efficacious as standard dose and that side effects generally rose 
steeply with dose. In terms of results for quarter-dose therapy, 
there were limited data on efficacy, and no analyses on side 
effects from the 19 studies quantifying single quarter-dose 
effects in the Law 2003 review. The present review included 
a further 23 trials of quarter-dose therapy. As with the current 
review, Law et al did not find any clear evidence that one drug 
class was more effective than any other. However, as with 
other systematic reviews of dose response within treatment 
classes,25 Law et al also noted that there is considerable vari-
ability in potency per mg, and so the choice of standard dose 
is relevant to such comparisons. In the context of other low-
dose combination therapy trials, the most relevant compared 
triple half-dose therapy (amlodipine 2.5 mg, losartan 25 mg,

hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) with placebo and also observed 
a large blood pressure reduction, of −17.9/−9.8 mm Hg.26
Perspectives
This review suggests a potentially broader clinical role for 
low-dose blood pressure–lowering drugs. Use of dual quarter-
dose blood pressure–lowering therapy may be preferable to 
standard-dose monotherapy, given comparable blood pres-
sure reduction with better tolerability. Alternatively, addition 
of a single quarter-dose agent to existing therapy is likely to 
confer an extra 3 to 4 mm Hg systolic blood pressure reduc-
tion without additional side effects and thus could be pref-
erable to doubling the dose of the existing agent, which on 
average confers only about a 1–2 mm Hg extra systolic blood 
pressure reduction at the expense of increased side effects.7,27 
Currently, there are a few low-dose combinations available 
to clinicians: for example, a bisoprolol–hydrochlorothiazide 
combination is on the market in the United States (Ziac), with 
a dual quarter-dose version indicated for initial treatment of 
hypertension; a perindopril–indapamide combination is avail-
able that includes half dose and quarter dose, supported by 
clinical trial data showing improved rates of adverse event-
free blood pressure control compared with sequential mono-
therapy or stepped care.28 Quarter doses are available for many 
β-blockers and are obtainable for other classes from halving 
existing half-doses. However, for many patients, more blood 
pressure reduction than that given by standard-dose mono-
therapy or dual quarter-dose therapy is needed.29 This review 
suggests considerably more research is required, to examine 
the potential of triple or quadruple quarter-dose combinations 
to determine whether they could provide substantial blood 
pressure–lowering with little or no drug-specific side effects, 
that is, more or less pure blood pressure lowering. Future trials 
should explore this hypothesis, testing quarter-dose combi-
nations as initial therapy and also for those uncontrolled on 
monotherapy who need additional blood pressure reduction 
and for particular patient groups of interest, such as the elderly 
or those with impaired renal function. Further information on 
tolerability of such combinations is critical, given the near 
absence of data in this regard. Relevant clinical trials should 
also assess patient acceptability and the potential for low-dose 
combination pills to improve long-term adherence.

What Is New?
• There are few data on the efficacy or tolerability of ultralow-dose blood 
pressure combinations.
What Is Relevant?
• Dual quarter-dose therapy is as effective as standard-dose monothera-
py, with fewer side effects.
• Quadruple quarter-dose therapy seems to be around twice as efficacious 
as standard-dose monotherapy, but there are few data on side effects.
Summary
Quarter-dose combinations could provide improvements in efficacy 
and tolerability of blood pressure–lowering therapy.
