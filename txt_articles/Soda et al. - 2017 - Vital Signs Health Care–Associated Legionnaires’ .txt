Abstract
Background: Legionnaires’ disease, a severe pneumonia, is typically acquired through inhalation of aerosolized water 
containing Legionella bacteria. Legionella can grow in the complex water systems of buildings, including health care 
facilities. Effective water management programs could prevent the growth of Legionella in building water systems.
Methods: Using national surveillance data, Legionnaires’ disease cases were characterized from the 21 jurisdictions (20 
U.S. states and one large metropolitan area) that reported exposure information for ≥90% of 2015 Legionella infections. 
An assessment of whether cases were health care–associated was completed; definite health care association was defined 
as hospitalization or long-term care facility residence for the entire 10 days preceding symptom onset, and possible 
association was defined as any exposure to a health care facility for a portion of the 10 days preceding symptom onset. 
All other Legionnaires’ disease cases were considered unrelated to health care.
Results: A total of 2,809 confirmed Legionnaires’ disease cases were reported from the 21 jurisdictions, including 85 
(3%) definite and 468 (17%) possible health care–associated cases. Among the 21 jurisdictions, 16 (76%) reported 1–21 
definite health care–associated cases per jurisdiction. Among definite health care–associated cases, the majority (75, 88%) 
occurred in persons aged ≥60 years, and exposures occurred at 72 facilities (15 hospitals and 57 long-term care facilities). 
The case fatality rate was 25% for definite and 10% for possible health care–associated Legionnaires’ disease.
Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Exposure to Legionella from health care facility water systems 
can result in Legionnaires’ disease. The high case fatality rate of health care–associated Legionnaires’ disease highlights 
the importance of case prevention and response activities, including implementation of effective water management 
programs and timely case identification.
Introduction
Legionella is a waterborne bacterium responsible for 
Legionnaires’ disease, a severe pneumonia that occurs most fre-
quently in susceptible persons, including those aged ≥50 years, 
former or current smokers, and those with chronic diseases 
or immunosuppression (1). Whereas approximately 9% of 
Legionnaires’ disease cases are fatal (1), mortality associated 
with health care–associated Legionnaires’ disease is higher, with 
reported case fatality rates (CFRs) historically as high as 46% (2). 
Legionella grows well in building water systems* that are not 
adequately managed, especially those where disinfectant levels 
are low, water is stagnant, or water temperatures are optimal 
* Large or complex water systems, where Legionella has more opportunity to 
grow and spread, are most often found in commercial, institutional, multiunit 
residential, health care, and industrial buildings, often with multiple stories. 
ASHRAE Standard 188 recommends water management for these types of 
buildings in addition to those in which vulnerable populations, such as 
immunocompromised or elderly persons, live or are treated.
for growth† (3). Illness with Legionnaires’ disease most com-
monly occurs after inhalation of Legionella-containing aerosols 
from showerheads, certain medical equipment (e.g., respiratory 
equipment), cooling towers, hot tubs, hydrotherapy equipment, 
or decorative fountains (4). Less commonly, disease occurs from 
aspiration of Legionella-containing water (5). Only one case of 
probable person-to-person transmission has been reported (6).
The size and complexity of health care facility water sys-
tems and the vulnerability of the patient populations served 
by these facilities increase the risk for Legionella transmission 
and severe outcomes. A review of 27 Legionnaires’ disease 
† The temperature range most favorable for growth of Legionella is 77°F–108°F 
(25°C–42°C), although Legionella has been recovered from water with 
temperatures outside this range. For health care facilities, ASHRAE Guideline 12-2000 
recommends storing and distributing cold water at temperatures <68°F (<20°C), 
whereas hot water should be stored at >140°F (>60°C) and circulated with a 
minimum return temperature of 124°F (51°C). In other settings, hot water should 
be stored at ≥120°F (≥49°C).

outbreaks investigated by CDC during 2000–2014 indicated 
that health care–associated Legionnaires’ disease accounted 
for 33% of the outbreaks, 57% of outbreak-associated cases, 
and 85% of outbreak-associated deaths (7). In addition, 85% 
of all Legionnaires’ disease outbreaks were attributed to water 
system exposures that could have been prevented by effective 
water management programs.
Implementation of water management programs that prevent 
conditions conducive to Legionella growth and transmission, 
combined with rapid case identification and investigation, 
could prevent health care–associated Legionnaires’ disease 
cases and outbreaks (8–10). Health care facilities are ideally 
positioned to establish and maintain prevention and response 
activities because they can build upon existing infection control 
and patient safety activities.
Legionnaires’ disease cases are reportable to CDC. Fifty 
states, two large U.S. metropolitan areas, and five territo-
ries report basic demographic information to the National 
Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) for all 
cases of legionellosis, which comprises two distinct clinical 
presentations: Pontiac fever, a mild influenza-like illness, and 
Legionnaires’ disease. NNDSS does not distinguish between 
the two presentations. In 2015, 6,079 cases of legionellosis 
were reported to NNDSS, although this number might be an 
underestimate because of underdiagnosis. The Supplemental 
Legionnaires’ Disease Surveillance System (SLDSS) receives 
more epidemiologic information, such as exposure to health 
care facilities, and does distinguish Legionnaires’ disease from 
Pontiac fever, but reporting to SLDSS is less complete.
The proportion of the U.S. Legionnaires’ disease cases 
associated with health care facilities has not been established. 
The objective of this analysis was to describe reported U.S. 
cases of health care–associated Legionnaires’ disease using 
surveillance data from 21 jurisdictions in 2015 to highlight the 
importance of Legionnaires’ disease prevention and response 
in health care facilities.
Methods
The 20 states and one large metropolitan area§ that reported 
≥90% of confirmed NNDSS legionellosis cases to SLDSS 
in 2015 were included in this analysis. Only confirmed 
Legionnaires’ disease cases from SLDSS, defined by the 
Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists as laboratory 
confirmation of Legionella in a person with clinical illness 
compatible with Legionnaires’ disease (11), were analyzed.
§ The 21 jurisdictions are Alabama, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, 
Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, 
New Mexico, New York, New York City, North Dakota, Ohio, Rhode Island, 
South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia.
Reported case exposures were categorized as health care–
associated or not health care–associated. Cases were considered 
health care–associated if they occurred in a person who visited, 
worked, or stayed in a health care facility for any amount of 
time in the 10 days preceding symptom onset. Health care–
associated Legionnaires’ disease cases were further classified as 
definite (continuous exposure to a hospital or long-term care 
facility for the entire 10 days preceding symptom onset) or 
possible (any exposure to a health care facility for a portion of 
the 10 days preceding symptom onset). Health care–specific 
exposure settings included hospitals, long-term care facilities 
(facilities providing a skilled need such as intravenous medi-
cation administration), clinics, and others (e.g., outpatient 
laboratories). Descriptive statistics were generated, and results 
are reflective of cases reported to SLDSS as of April 14, 2017.
Results
Among 6,079 confirmed legionellosis cases reported to 
NNDSS, SLDSS received reports of 3,516 (58%), including 
3,459 Legionnaires’ disease cases (Figure). Among the 3,459 
Legionnaires’ disease cases, 2,809 (81%) were reported by the 
21 jurisdictions included in this analysis, including 553 (20%) 
that were health care–associated.
Among the 21 jurisdictions, 16 (76%) reported definite 
health care–associated cases (1–21 cases per jurisdiction); four 
of the remaining five reported possible health care–associated 
Legionnaires’ disease cases. Definite and possible health care–
associated cases accounted for 3% and 17%, respectively, of all 
cases reported by the 21 jurisdictions (Figure). CFR was 12% 
overall for health care–associated Legionnaires’ disease cases 
(25% for definite and 10% for possible cases).
Among the 85 definite health care–associated Legionnaires’ 
disease cases, 68 (80%) were associated with long-term care 
facilities, 15 (18%) with hospitals, and two (2%) with both 
(Table 1). Definite health care–associated Legionnaires’ disease 
cases were reported in 72 facilities, including 15 hospitals and 
57 long-term care facilities, and included one to six cases per 
facility. The majority of definite cases occurred in persons aged 
≥60 years (75, 88%) (Table 2).
Among 468 possible health care–associated Legionnaires’ 
disease cases, 61 (13%) were possibly associated with long-
term care facilities, 227 (49%) with hospitals, 123 (26%) 
with clinics, 13 (3%) with other settings such as outpatient 
laboratories, and 44 (9%) with more than one setting. Possible 
health care–associated Legionnaires’ disease cases occurred 
in approximately 415 health care facilities and included 
one to 31 cases per facility.

Conclusions and Comments
Although health care–associated Legionnaires’ disease is less 
common than some other health care–acquired infections, its 
impact on patients and affected health care facilities is con-
siderable. For patients, health care–associated Legionnaires’ 
disease can result in high morbidity, mortality, and financial 
cost (1,12). For health care facilities, Legionnaires’ disease 
cases and outbreaks can involve substantial expense related 
to investigation, remediation, legal action, and reputational 
costs (13,14). Furthermore, compared with more common 
health care–acquired infections, general understanding of the 
necessary prevention and response measures for waterborne 
pathogens, such as Legionella, might be lacking.
In this analysis, definite health care–associated Legionnaires’ 
disease cases were reported by the majority of the 21 jurisdic-
tions and occurred in 72 institutions. Although only 3% of 
reported Legionnaires’ disease cases from the 21 jurisdictions 
were definitely health care–associated, the CFR among these 
cases was high. Furthermore, the number of definite cases and 
facilities reported here is likely an underestimate of the actual

case number, because some possible cases likely acquired their 
infection from a health care facility, and some infections were 
likely undiagnosed because of a lack of Legionella-specific 
testing. A larger number of definite cases were associated with 
long-term care facilities than with hospitals. One explanation 
for this might be that hospital stays are typically shorter (15) 
than the 10-day period used in this analysis to define a definite 
health care–associated case. Pending further research, other 
conclusions cannot accurately be drawn, and thus these find-
ings should not be used to establish the level of risk among 
facility types.
In health care facilities, prevention of the first case of 
Legionnaires’ disease is the ultimate goal. This goal is likely 
best achieved by establishing and maintaining an effective water 
management program (8,10). In 2015, ASHRAE¶ issued guid-
ance on water management programs (3). CDC and partners 
adapted this standard into a simpler format (https://www.cdc.
gov/legionella/WMPtoolkit) that guides users such as health 
care facility leaders** or other decision makers through the 
steps needed for such a program. Most recently, the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services released a survey and certifica-
tion memo stating that health care facilities should develop and 
adhere to ASHRAE-compliant water management programs 
to reduce the risk for Legionella and other pathogens in their 
water systems (16).
In general, the principles of effective water management 
include maintaining water temperatures outside the ideal range 
for Legionella growth, preventing water stagnation, ensuring 
adequate disinfection, and maintaining equipment to prevent 
scale, corrosion, and biofilm growth, which provide a habitat 
and nutrients for Legionella (3). Once established, water man-
agement programs require regular monitoring of key areas in 
the system for potentially hazardous conditions, and the use 
of prespecified responses to remediate such conditions if they 
are detected. The additional benefit of water management 
programs include the control of other water-related health 
care–associated infections such as those caused by nontuber-
culous mycobacteria. Programs need to be monitored for their 
efficacy in reducing risk across microbial species (17). Such 
ongoing monitoring is especially relevant because specific 
mitigation strategies, or partially implemented mitigation 
strategies, might control one pathogen at the expense of select-
ing for another (18).

** Persons in leadership roles for prevention activities might include infection 
control practitioners, facility managers, hospital administrators, quality 
assurance staff members, or others who are ultimately responsible for 
implementing an effective water management program and for ensuring that 
ongoing communication regarding Legionella occurs between environmental 
health personnel, clinical staff members, and public health officials.

 § Definite case of health care–associated Legionnaires’ disease was defined as 
laboratory-confirmed legionellosis in a patient with exposure to a hospital 
or long-term–care facility for the entire 10 days preceding symptom onset.
 ¶ Possible case of health care–associated Legionnaires’ disease was defined as 
laboratory-confirmed legionellosis in a patient with exposure to a health care 
facility for a portion of the 10 days preceding symptom onset.
 ** Multiple indicates two or more of the listed setting categories.
 †† Other setting includes locations such as outpatient laboratories.
Health care providers play a critical role in prevention and 
response by rapidly identifying and reporting cases. Legionnaires’ 
disease is clinically indistinguishable from other causes of pneu-
monia; a failure to diagnose a health care–associated case could 
result in a missed opportunity to prevent subsequent cases. 
Legionella should be considered as a cause of health care–associ-
ated pneumonia, especially for groups at increased risk, when 
other facility-related cases have been identified, or when changes 
in water parameters might lead to increased risk for Legionnaires’ 
disease. The preferred diagnostic procedure for Legionnaires’ 
disease is to concurrently obtain a lower respiratory sputum 
sample for culture on selective media and a Legionella urinary 
antigen test. Sputum should ideally be obtained before antibi-
otic administration and should not be rejected on the basis of 
specimen quality (e.g., lack of polymorphonuclear leukocytes 
or contamination with other bacteria), as sputa produced by 
patients with Legionnaires’ disease might not be purulent and 
contaminating bacteria will not negatively affect isolation of 
Legionella on selective media (19,20). The urinary antigen test 
only detects Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, the most com-
mon cause of Legionnaires’ disease (21). Particularly in health 
care settings, cases of Legionnaires’ disease caused by other species 
and serogroups can occur. An isolate from culture is needed for 
the identification of these species and serogroups, as well as for 
molecular comparison of clinical to environmental isolates as 
part of investigations.
In addition to being critical partners in national Legionnaires’ 
disease reporting, public health jurisdictions have an influential

role in prevention and response activities. Some public health 
departments or agencies might serve as a resource to facilities 
during the development, implementation, and evaluation 
of a water management program. Public health officials also 
play an important role in response, including outbreak iden-
tification, environmental assessment to determine Legionella 
exposure sources, and development of recommendations to 
prevent ongoing transmission. Hence, prompt reporting of 
Legionnaires’ disease cases to public health can facilitate a 
timely and effective response.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions. First, data from more jurisdictions and more years would 
Key Points
• Legionnaires’ disease is a severe lung infection caused 
by breathing in small droplets of water that contain 
Legionella bacteria. Persons aged ≥50 years, current or 
former smokers, and those with chronic diseases or a 
weakened immune system are at higher risk for 
Legionnaires’ disease.
• Legionella grows well in building water systems that 
are not adequately managed such as those in which 
disinfectant levels are low or water temperatures are warm. 
Effective water management programs are recommended 
to prevent Legionella growth in buildings with large or 
complex water systems, including health care facilities.
• The size and complexity of health care facility water 
systems might increase the risk for Legionella growth. 
Such health care facilities also provide care to persons 
who might be more susceptible to Legionnaires’ disease 
because of their underlying risk factors.
• Legionnaires’ disease continues to occur in U.S. health 
care facilities. Sixteen of the 21 U.S. jurisdictions, 
including 72 health care facilities in this analysis, 
reported definite health care–associated cases of 
Legionnaires’ disease.
• One fourth of persons with definite health care–
associated Legionnaires’ disease die.
• Prevention and response requires coordination among 
health care facility leaders, health care providers, and 
public health professionals. Instituting and maintaining 
effective water management programs are the principal 
prevention measures. Rapid patient identification with 
appropriate laboratory testing and prompt intervention 
might prevent additional cases from occurring.

improve the accuracy of U.S. health care–associated Legionnaires’ 
disease case estimates. Second, the completeness of the health 
care exposure information in this data set was not assessed. For 
example, whether a substantial number of health care exposures 
were not reported or inaccurately reported is unknown. Finally, 
CFRs reported here might be biased by lack of information on 
Legionnaires’ disease deaths that occurred after reporting to CDC 
(resulting in CFR underestimation) or deaths of Legionnaires’ dis-
ease patients from other causes (resulting in CFR overestimation).
This report demonstrates that Legionnaires’ disease con-
tinues to result from exposures to health care facility water 
systems. The high case fatality rate of health care–associated

Legionnaires’ disease underscores the need for effective preven-
tion and response programs. Implementation and maintenance 
of water management programs, combined with rapid case 
identification and investigation, could reduce the number of 
health care–associated Legionnaires’ disease cases.
