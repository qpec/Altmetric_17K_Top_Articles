“B
ig data” has the potential to support personalized or 
precision medicine through more complex risk-
prediction algorithms with more predictors.1–3 These 
data can be used to accurately assess disease risk across sub-
groups with distinct characteristics or health profiles — including 
situations where a health profile represents only a fraction of the 
overall population.
Furthermore, compared with more commonly used clinical 
data or epidemiology studies, large population health surveys 
have the potential to generate predictive algorithms that are 
more patient-oriented, have the potential to perform better 
across socioeconomic groups, and can be used for both popula-
tion and clinical purposes.
First, population health surveys emphasize sociodemo-
graphic profile and health behaviours. These patient-oriented 
risks are common for multiple chronic diseases.4 Risks are all 
ascertained using self-response questions and validated for use 
in a broad community setting. This allows people to calculate 
their own risk in a nonclinical setting — reducing the burden on 
clinicians to collect and perform risk calculation. Second, algo-
rithms developed using entire populations should be better cali-
brated (i.e., predictive risk closely approximating real or 
observed risk) and generalizable (i.e., better performing in a 
wide range of settings). As well, there are opportunities to recali-
brate risk algorithms using population data that are not feasible 
with clinical data.5,6 Third, population-based algorithms can be

AbstrAct
BackgRounD: Routinely collected data 
from large population health surveys 
linked to chronic disease outcomes 
create an opportunity to develop more 
complex risk-prediction algorithms. We 
developed a predictive algorithm to esti-
mate 5-year risk of incident cardiovascu-
lar disease in the community setting. 
MeThoDs: We derived the Cardiovas-
cular Disease Population Risk Tool 
(CVDPoRT) using prospectively collected 
data from Ontario respondents of the 
Canadian Community Health Surveys, 
representing 98% of the Ontario popula-
tion (survey years 2001 to 2007; follow-
up from 2001 to 2012) linked to hospital 
admission and vital statistics databases. 
Predictors included body mass index, 
hypertension, diabetes, and multiple 
behavioural, demographic and general 
health risk factors. The primary outcome 
was the first major cardiovascular event 
resulting in hospital admission or death. 
Death from a noncardiovascular cause 
was considered a competing risk.
ResulTs: We included 104 219 respon-
dents aged 20 to 105 years. There were 
3709 cardiovascular events and 818 478 
person-years follow-up in the combined 
derivation and validation cohorts (5-year 
cumulative incidence function, men: 
0.026, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.025–
0.028; women: 0.018, 95% 0.017–0.019). 
The final CVDPoRT algorithm contained 
12 variables, was discriminating (men: 
C statistic 0.82, 95% CI 0.81–0.83; 
women: 0.86, 95% CI 0.85–0.87) and was 
well-calibrated in the overall population 
(5-year observed cumulative incidence 
function v. predicted risk, men: 0.28%; 
women: 0.38%) and in nearly all pre-
defined policy-relevant subgroups (206 
of 208 groups).
InTeRPReTaTIon: The CVDPoRT algo-
rithm can accurately discriminate cardio-
vascular disease risk for a wide range of 
health profiles without the aid of clinical 
measures. Such algorithms hold potential 
to support precision medicine for individ-
ual or population uses. study registra-

more easily used for population planning. Examples of popula-
tion uses include estimating the future incidence of cardiovas-
cular disease events in populations and estimating the future 
burden of health behaviours (e.g., smoking, physical activity, 
alcohol and diet).7,8 A precision population health approach tai-
lors preventive strategies for specific subgroups at risk.9,10 For 
example, subgroups with a low socioeconomic position typically 
have higher cardiovascular disease risk and may benefit from a 
wider range and more intensive interventions for effective pre-
vention and health promotion.11–13
We developed and validated a prognostic cardiovascular disease 
risk algorithm — the Cardiovascular Disease Population Risk Tool 
(CVDPoRT) — using routinely collected data from population health 
surveys. The CVDPoRT has 2 potential uses: patient-oriented, indi-
vidual cardiovascular disease risk assessment in the community set-
ting, including assessment by patients or their clinicians; and popu-
lation cardiovascular disease risk assessment for planning and 
research, including the evaluation of preventive strategies.9,10
Methods
study design and participants
The CVDPoRT was derived and validated using population-based 
secondary data. There were 4 steps:
• 
Model derivation — creation of the CVDPoRT risk algorithm 
using respondents to the combined Ontario sample of the 
2001, 2003 and 2005 Canadian Community Health Surveys.
• 
Model validation — validation of the CVDPoRT using the 
2007 Canadian Community Health Survey.
• 
Final model generation — combination of validation and 
derivation data to estimate the final application the 
CVDPoRT algorithm using the same model specification as 
the original derivation model.
• 
Derivation of the application model — creation of a parsi-
monious model (fewer predictors) that maintains discrimi-
native ability, calibration and overall model performance.
The protocol for development and validation of the CVDPoRT 
was registered and published (ClinicalTrials.gov, no. 
NCT02267447).14 We adhered to the protocol without deviation from 
the published analysis plan with 2 exceptions: only the 2007 Cana-
dian Community Health Survey was used for validation (as opposed 
to both 2007 and 2009), and additional sensitivity testing and 
exploratory analyses were performed after algorithm development, 
as described in the “Statistical analysis” section. Here we report 
analyses of the primary study outcome described in the protocol.
Respondents were excluded if they were not eligible for 
Ontario’s universal health insurance program, were pregnant, 
self-reported a prior history of heart disease or stroke, or were 
younger than 20 years at the time of survey administration.
Data sources  
Predictors were ascertained using self-responses from the Cana-
dian Community Health Surveys. The Canadian Community 
Health Survey uses a multistage stratified cluster design that 
represents about 98% of the Canadian population over the age 
of 12 years and attains an average response rate of 80.5%.15
To ascertain cardiovascular disease events, we individually 
linked the survey respondents to 2 population-based databases: 
hospital-admission records from the Canadian Institute for Health 
Information Discharge Abstract Database, and deaths from the 
Office of the Registrar General of Ontario Vital Statistics Data-
base.16,17 All cardiovascular disease events and deaths were coded 
as International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related 
Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes (or ICD-9 codes for 
deaths before 2003 and hospital discharges before 2002).
outcomes
The primary outcome of interest was 5-year incidence of a major 
cardiovascular disease event resulting in hospital admission or 
death from cardiovascular disease (diagnostic codes and criteria as 
presented in Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.170914/-/DC1).16 Respondents were followed 
from the survey administration date until the earliest of the follow-
ing: incident event, death due to causes other than cardiovascular 
disease (defined as a competing risk), loss to follow-up (defined as 
loss of health care eligibility) or end of study (Dec. 31, 2012).
statistical analysis
We followed guidelines by Harrell18 and Steyerberg19 in the devel-
opment of our analysis plan, which was constructed before any 
model fitting or any descriptive analyses involving the exposure–
outcome associations. Key considerations in our approach were 
full prespecification of the predictor variables, use of flexible 
functions for continuous predictors, and preservation of statisti-
cal properties through avoidance of data-driven variable-
selection procedures.
Table 1 shows the 21 predictor variables that were identified, 
including 7 sociodemographic, 8 behavioural,7,8,21 5 general 
health and chronic conditions, and 1 design variable.9,22 The 
model included interactions between age and smoking, alcohol, 
diet, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), diabetes and 
hypertension.
Data cleaning, model specification and model estimation are 
presented in Appendix 2, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170914/-/DC1. Models were estimated 
using a proportional hazards model for the subdistribution of a 
competing risk, with death from a noncardiovascular disease 
cause considered as a competing risk.23
Performance in the derivation and validation cohorts was 
assessed using measures of discrimination (ability to differenti-
ate between individuals with high and low risk), and calibration 
(agreement between predicted and observed risk).9,24–26 Sub-
groups were examined using predefined criteria for clinically or 
policy relevant standards of calibration (< 20% difference 
between observed and predicted estimates for categories with 
prevalence higher than 5%).7,9
The CVDPoRT differs from existing cardiovascular disease 
algorithms in its use of the competing risk approach. To facilitate 
algorithm comparison and to examine the role of competing 
risks for cardiovascular disease prediction, we conducted sensi-
tivity analyses in which we used a standard Cox model, but oth-
erwise maintained all predictor specifications.

We used the step-down procedure described by Ambler and 
colleagues27 to identify a parsimonious model for applications 
where parsimony may be more important than accuracy. This 
procedure involves deleting variables to a desired degree of 
accuracy based on contribution to model R2.

The use of data in this project was authorized under section 45 of 
Ontario’s Personal Health Information Protection Act, which 
does not require review by a research ethics board. 
Results
Participants
The combined derivation and validation cohort consisted of 
104 219 respondents, 818 478 person-years follow-up, with 3709 
cardiovascular disease events until Dec. 31, 2012. The number of 
noncardiovascular disease deaths (events from competing risk) 
in the combined cohort was 2947 for men and 3390 for women 
(Figure 1). Pack-years of smoking had the most missing data 
(2.5% of the study population), with other health behaviours

ticipants were lost to follow-up; 1.2% of participants were lost to 
follow-up in the validation data set.
Model specification and development
The predictors, along with their initial and final degrees of free-
dom are shown in Table 1. Partial correlation plots are presented 
in Appendix 3, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.170914/-/DC1.
The female and male full models had 48 degrees of freedom 
and 47 degrees of freedom, respectively, with 20 predictors 
(10 continuous) and 13 interaction terms (Table 1). The final 
(reduced) model for females had 36 degrees of freedom with 
12 predictors (6 continuous) and 9 interaction terms; the model 
for males had 37 degrees of freedom with 12 predictors (7 con-
tinuous) and 9 interaction terms (Table 1). The complete model 
specifications, estimated coefficients and the survey question-
naire are available in Appendices 4 and 5, available at www.cmaj.
ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170914/-/DC1, and at https://
github.com/Ottawa-mHealth/predictive-algorithms. Figures 2 
and 3 show the predicted risk for median exposure compared 
with a reference for each predictor for females and males. An 
interactive relative risk plot is available at www.projectbiglife.ca, 
and shows the influence of age and exposure–outcome relations.
Model performance
Table 3 presents summary indicators of model performance. The 
model showed good ability to correctly rank order (discriminate) 
people with different risk levels (women: C statistic 0.86, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 0.85–0.87; men: 0.82, 95% CI 0.81–0.83).

Discrimination remained stable across development, validation 
and pooled data. Predictive risk closely approximated observed 
risk (calibration slope for women: 0.9734, SE 0.0698; for men: 
0.9295, SE 0.0731) (Appendix 8, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170914/-/DC1).
There was close agreement between predicted and observed 
numbers of cardiovascular disease events within the overall pop-
ulation (5-year observed cumulative incidence function v. pre-
dicted risk in men: 0.28%; in women: 0.38%) (Table 3). Among 
men, the algorithm was well-calibrated in 110 of 111 predefined 
policy-relevant subgroups, with observed versus predicted risk 
being greater than the predefined difference of 20% only for peo-
ple with no leisure time physical activity (0 metabolic equivalents 
of task [METs]) (Appendix 7, available at www.

than the predefined difference of 20% only for the lowest level of 
sense of belonging (Appendix 6, available at www.

A sensitivity analysis, in which algorithms were generated 
using a Cox proportional hazards model without competing risks, 
found slightly improved calibration in several subgroups, partic-
ularly those at higher risk deciles and for people older than age 
70 years, but differences did not reach significance and the mod-
els had similar discrimination (men: C statistic 0.84 v. 0.82; 
women: 0.87 v. 0.86) (Appendix 9, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170914/-/DC1).
Interpretation
The CVDPoRT was developed and validated using large population 
health surveys that are routinely collected and contain only self-
reported risk factors. The CVDPoRT has a high discrimination and 
shows good calibration in a wide range of sociodemographic 
groups — including education, ethnicity, immigration status, area 
deprivation and social cohesion — despite omission of risk factors

such as lipid levels and measured blood pressure. We attribute the 
favourable performance of the CVDPoRT to greater model specifica-
tion and complexity compared with other commonly used cardio-
vascular disease risk algorithms.
The algorithm was developed for population and individual uses. 
For population uses, health surveys (which are available in more 
than 100 countries) can be used to predict the number of people 
who will develop cardiovascular disease.7,9 How risk varies across 
populations — whether risk is diffused or concentrated — is a cor-
nerstone of modern population planning.34 Multivariable predictive 
algorithms are the most robust approach to describe population 
risk, and their use improves the assessment of population strate-
gies.10 Although the World Health Organization and others currently 
measure burden of disease without including an equity perspec-
tive,35 the inclusion of sociodemographic factors in the CVDPoRT 
allows a straightforward assessment of cardiovascular disease risk, 
burden and intervention effectiveness by socioeconomic status.7,8
For individual use, the CVDPoRT’s discrimination is exceeded 
only by QRISK3 — an algorithm that was also developed using “big” 
data; however, QRISK3 used clinical data that focused on clinical 
measures (lipids, blood pressure and disease states).36,37 Clinicians 
and patients appear to favour health behaviour interventions over 
medications for patients at low and medium risk,38 but existing car-
diovascular risk algorithms seldom assess the role of health behav-
iours beyond smoking.2,39 This means that clinicians have difficulty 
communicating the degree to which health behaviours contribute to 
cardiovascular risk, as well as the potential benefit from behavioural 
interventions.40,41 The CVDPoRT allows patients to assess their risk 
outside the clinic setting with only self-reported measures — with 
predictive accuracy that is better than that assessed using the algo-
rithms currently recommended in Canada for the clinical setting.42 
Complex algorithms with many predictors are not necessarily more 
burdensome to patients — rather the opposite if, for example, calcu-
lations can be performed with partial responses using adaptive

questionnaires (see the CVDPoRT online calculator at www.project 
biglife.ca). The CVDPoRT predictors are centred, which allows 
patients to calculate their cardiovascular disease risk as each ques-
tion is answered with unbiased calculations. The concept of assess-
ing risk incrementally as more information is available is a central 
concept to clinical decision-making, and facilitated when algorithms 
are derived using big data, but has not yet been widely adopted in 
chronic disease predictive algorithms.43,44 Personalized risk commu-
nication follows personalized risk assessment with a range of cardio-
vascular disease risk measures such as heart age.45 See Box 1 for an 
example of CVDPoRT for individual use.
The use of large, routinely collected population health surveys 
provides 2 perspectives that are relevant for precision medicine. First, 
large databases provide sufficient statistical power to develop and 
validate predictive algorithms with a larger set of risk factors and 
greater specification of those risks, which in turn generate distinct 
risk estimates for a wide range of health profiles or populations.
Second, the high discriminating ability of the CVDPoRT sug-
gests that sociodemographic factors and health behaviours have 
an important role in precision medicine. For example, although 
smoking is included in most clinical cardiovascular disease risk 
algorithms, it is typically considered as a categorical measure (i.e., 
current, former or never smoker). This is despite the fact that 
smoking is the most important cardiovascular disease risk factor, 
there is a clear continuous dose–response relationship, there is 
clear attenuation of risk with age, and there are clear recommen-
dations that continuous measures should not be categorized in 
predictive algorithms.41,46,47
A concern with complex algorithms is the lack of improved dis-
crimination in the overall population when predictors are added 
beyond 4 or 5 basic exposures.48,49 In precision medicine there is 
less emphasis on the overall population and more on the value of 
prediction “within” individuals (clinical uses) or subgroups (popula-
tion uses).50–53 We emphasized calibration across subgroups as a

measure of the CVDPoRT’s value for precision medicine.53,54 Com-
monly, calibration is assessed across deciles of predictive risk. 
Large data allowed us to assess CVDPoRT calibration for more than 
200 predefined, policy-relevant subgroups.
The CVDPoRT maintained very good calibration (191 of 205 sub-
groups) and was developed with few missing follow-up data, but 
we recommend recalibration of the CVDPoRT for most new set-
tings. Fortunately, population-based data and health surveys pro-
vide opportunities to assess and recalibrate risk algorithms that are 
not available in the clinical setting.7,55 Surveys that are similar to 
the Canadian Community Health Survey are available in many 
countries worldwide. Increasingly, these surveys are being linked 
to health outcomes, enabling calibration assessment and, if 
required, recalibration. Additionally, unlinked cardiovascular dis-
ease events are even more available worldwide; these events can 
be compared with predicted cardiovascular disease events — cal-
culated using the CVDPoRT and local population health surveys — 
to enable recalibration to the local population.5 The need for recali-
bration would not indicate that the CVDPoRT has poor predictive 
accuracy; rather, it would signal that factors beyond those included 
in the CVDPoRT are influencing baseline risk in the new population. 
Recalibration adjusts for these factors — conserving the purpose of 
the CVDPoRT to discriminate risk based on health behaviours 
(smoking, alcohol, diet and exercise).

*Three types of performance tests were examined:28 1) Discrimination is the ability of a prediction model to differentiate between those who do and do not develop the outcome of interest. 
C-statistic is a rank order statistic for predictions against true outcomes.18,29 The statistic ranges from 0 to 1: a value of 0.5 indicates the model is no better than random prediction, a value of 
1 indicates the model perfectly predicts those who will develop the outcome of interest and those who will not. Ratio of 95 to 5 risk percentiles is a test of discrimination. A higher ratio 
indicates a more discriminating algorithm. For example, a ratio of 100 indicates that the absolute risk is 100 times higher for a person in the 95th percentile than for a person in the 
5th percentile. The ratio can be used to gauge the potential absolute benefit of treatment for different individuals in the development and validation cohorts. For an intervention with the 
same relative benefit, a risk ratio of 100 indicates that 1 person will have 100 times the absolute benefit of the comparative person. 2) Calibration reflects agreement between the observed 
outcomes and predictions. Calibration (or accuracy) describes how well the predicted probability of disease agrees with the observed outcome. Observed versus predicted (O v. P) is the 
relative difference between the observed incidence and predicted risk. A 1% difference in O v. P indicates 1% more cardiovascular events were observed than predicted. This table shows 
overall O v. P. Appendices 6 and 7, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170914/-/DC1, show O v. P for specific subgroups. This table presents an absolute measure of 
O v. P as the observed 5-year cumulative incidence and the predicted 5-year risk. A graphical assessment of calibration is presented in Appendix 8, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.170914/-/DC1 (calibration plots). 3) Overall performance measures. Brierscaled score is a measure of overall agreement between observed and predictive risk with values 
between 0 and 1.30 This scaled Brier score happens to be very similar to the Pearson R2 statistic.31 Nagelkerke R2 is a measure of amount the model explains the variation of risk between 
respondents in the development or validation data with values from 0 to 1.32,33 Larger R2 values indicate that more of the variation is explained by the model, to a maximum of 1.

Cardiovascular disease has predictors that span sociodemo-
graphic (e.g., ethnicity, social position, immigrant status), envi-
ronmental (e.g., air pollution), distal (e.g., health behaviours), 
proximal (e.g., BMI, hypertension, lipids and other diseases) and 
genetic risks. To our knowledge, previous cardiovascular disease 
algorithms have not considered the full range of predictors or, 
more specifically, have not considered discriminating and well-
calibrated risk prediction for people exposed to those predictors. 
In the example of CVDPoRT and QRISK3 algorithms, there are sev-
eral important differences in the predictors used, which suggests 
that a combined algorithm that considers the range of predictors 
and interactions from both algorithms could be even more dis-
criminating and well-suited for precision medicine in clinical and 
population settings. Clearly, such an algorithm would require 
large data, suggesting there is a role for linking larger clinical and 
population data to provide a wider range of predictors that can 
be assessed.2 That stated, it may be overly challenging to see 
improved discrimination beyond that shown in our study or 
QRISK studies, and calibration may not improve for subpopula-
tions. In our study, we found that a more parsimonious CVDPoRT 
algorithm has essentially the same predictive ability as our fully 
prespecified algorithm.
limitations
A potential limitation is misclassification error resulting from use 
of self-reported predictors and routinely collected outcomes. 
Although more accurate risk factor ascertainment could improve 
discrimination and calibration, the CVDPoRT already has a high 
discrimination and favourable calibration. Other studies have also 
found that chronic diseases can be accurately assessed using self-
reports, with only modest classification differences when cardio-
vascular risk assessment is performed with and without clinical 
and laboratory measures.56,57
conclusion
The CVDPoRT discriminately assesses cardiovascular disease risk 
using information that focuses on sociodemographic and behav-
ioural risks. For the clinical setting, the CVDPoRT can be completed 
by individuals in the community, without assistance of a clinician or 
use of clinical measures (e.g., cholesterol and blood pressure), to 
help inform subsequent clinical decisions. In the population setting, 
the CVDPoRT can assess cardiovascular disease risk using popula-
tion health surveys that are available in many countries and settings.
