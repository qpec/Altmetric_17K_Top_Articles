 From Kindergarten Through Second Grade, U.S. Children’s
Obesity Prevalence Grows Only During Summer Vacations
Paul T. von Hippel1 and Joseph Workman2
Objective: To assess the relative importance of school and nonschool risk factors, this study estimated
whether overweight and obesity prevalence grows faster during the school year or during summer vacation.
Methods: In the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010–11, a nationally
representative complex random sample of 18,170 U.S. children was followed from the fall of kindergarten
in 2010 through the spring of second grade in 2013. Children’s weight and heights were measured in
schools each fall and spring. A multilevel growth model was used to estimate growth in mean BMI,
overweight prevalence, and obesity prevalence during each summer and each school year.
Results: From the fall of kindergarten to the spring of second grade, the prevalence of obesity increased
from 8.9% to 11.5%, and the prevalence of overweight increased from 23.3% to 28.7%. All of the
increase in prevalence occurred during the two summer vacations; no increase occurred during any of
the three school years.
Conclusions: The risk of obesity is higher when children are out of school than when they are in school.

Introduction
A fundamental question about child obesity is whether its causes lie
primarily inside or outside of schools. If obesity originates primarily
inside schools, then we may hope to substantially reduce obesity
through policies affecting school meals (1), competitive foods (2),
physical education (3), and other programs affecting the school envi-
ronment (4). But if obesity originates primarily outside of schools,
then school-based programs must try to shape out-of-school behav-
iors, and we must further emphasize out-of-school interventions to
reduce screen time (5), limit child-directed food marketing (6), pro-
mote out-of-school activities such as summer school (7) and summer
camp (8), and educate parents about nutrition (9).
One way to compare in-school and out-of-school influences is with a
seasonal design that compares growth in body mass index (BMI)
when children are in school during the academic year and when
school is out for summer vacation. If BMI grows fastest during the
school year, then school environments would appear to be the major
cause of obesity. But if BMI grows fastest during summer vacation,
then it would appear that the major risk factors lie outside of schools.
The most common finding of seasonal research is that BMI
increases faster during the summer than during the school year
(10,11), but some studies have not reported faster summer BMI
growth, even in high-risk groups such as Native Americans (12,13),
and nearly all seasonal studies have relied on local convenience
samples. Only one seasonal study has used nationally representative
data (14), and that study was limited to a single summer—the one
after kindergarten—and a single cohort of children who started kin-
dergarten in 1998 and are now 22 to 23 years old.
This article offers the second nationally representative analysis of sea-
sonal BMI gain. The data describe a recent cohort that started kinder-
garten in 2010, and the data cover three school years and two
summers from the start of kindergarten through the end of second
grade.
Methods
Sample and design
The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of
2010–11 (ECLS-K:2011) (15) is a complex probability sample from
the population of U.S. children who attended kindergarten in the fall
of 2010. The ECLS-K:2011 followed a multistage design, sampling
children within schools and schools within primary sampling units;

 each primary sampling unit was a large county or a group of adja-
cent and demographically similar small counties. The ECLS-K:2011
was stratified into public and private schools. Asian/Pacific Islander
children were over-sampled. Sample weights compensate for over-
sampling and nonresponse.
The complete ECLS-K:2011 consists of 18,170 children in 970
schools and 90 primary sampling units. After excluding children
with missing covariates and children from year-round schools, which
have short summer vacations, we had an analytic sample of 13,006
children in 846 schools.
The ECLS-K:2011 measured height and weight on six occasions—
once in the fall and spring of each school year from the fall of kin-
dergarten in 2010 through the spring of second grade in 2013. On
average, the ECLS-K:2011 took fall measurements 5 to 7 weeks after
the first day of school and took spring measurements 8 weeks before
the last day of school. On two occasions—the falls of first and second
grade—the ECLS-K:2011 took measurements only in a 30% random
subsample of schools. Subsampling did not introduce bias since the
subsample was random; however, the reduction in sample size does
reduce power on the affected measurement occasions.
On each occasion, height and weight were measured twice, using a
Shorr board stadiometer and a Seca Bella 840 flat electronic scale.
Children were asked to remove shoes, hats, and jackets. Comparing
the two BMI measurements, we calculated that the standard error of
measurement was 0.187 kg/m2. Unfortunately, the data do not
include other obesity-relevant measures such as waist circumference
or skinfold thickness.
Statistical analysis
We estimated mean BMI and the prevalence of overweight and obe-
sity [by the CDC definition (16)] on each measurement occasion.
Our estimates accounted for survey strata, clusters, and sample
weights. We used the svy commands in Stata software, version 13.
Next, using HLM software, version 7, we fit multilevel growth mod-
els to estimate rates of growth during each school year and summer
(17). We estimated mean growth rates, the variation of growth rates
between children and schools, and the association of growth rates
with demographic covariates including the child’s gender, race/ethnic-
ity, and age at the start of kindergarten; the square root of family
income and mother’s education level; and indicators for whether the
mother was employed or the child lived with a single parent. Details
of the growth model are given in the Online Supporting Information.
Results
Figure 1 plots mean BMI, obesity prevalence, and overweight preva-
lence on each measurement occasion from the fall of kindergarten
through the spring of second grade. Although mean BMI grows in
every period, it grows faster during the summers than during the
school years. Overweight and obesity prevalence grow only during
summer vacations, not during the school years.
The upper rows of Table 1 estimate growth in overweight and obe-
sity prevalence. At the start of kindergarten, the prevalence of over-
weight was approximately 23% and the prevalence of obesity was
approximately 9%. During summer 1 and summer 2, both over-
weight prevalence and obesity prevalence increased by approxi-
mately 1 percentage point per month (pp/m). These were significant
increases (all Ps < 0.001), which over the 2.6 to 2.7 months of an
average summer vacation added up to an increase of 2 to 3 percent-
age points in overweight and obesity prevalence.
During the school years, overweight prevalence did not increase at all,
and obesity prevalence actually decreased by approximately 0.1 pp/m
during both kindergarten and second grade (but not during first grade).
The kindergarten and second grade decreases in obesity prevalence are
statistically significant (both Ps < 0.001), but over the 9.3 to 9.4
months of an average school year they only add up to a 1 percentage
point decrease in obesity prevalence—not enough to reverse the 2 to 3
percentage point increases that occur during each summer vacation.
The next rows of Table 1 estimate growth in mean BMI. On aver-
age, BMI growth rates were faster during the summers than during
the school years. Average BMI grew at 0.02 kg/m2 per month dur-
ing kindergarten, accelerated to 0.07 kg/m2 per month during
summer 1, slowed to 0.03 kg/m2 per month during first grade, accel-
erated to 0.08 kg/m2 per month during summer 2, and slowed to

 0.05 kg/m2 per month during second grade. According to a planned
contrast, the average of the two summer growth rates exceeded the
average of the three school year growth rates by 0.04 kg/m2 per
month (95% CI 0.02–0.06 kg/m2 per month, P < 0.0001).
The rest of Table 1 summarizes the random effects. The standard devi-
ations (SDs) of the random effects show that BMI growth is more
variable during the summer than during the school year. At both the
child level and the school level, the SD of BMI growth is approxi-
mately three times greater during the two summers than during the
three school years. This pattern suggests that the common school envi-
ronment may reduce differences between children’s BMI growth rates.
Child-level correlations among the random effects show that initial
BMI is more positively correlated with summer BMI growth than
with school year BMI growth. These correlations may suggest that
out-of-school factors affect initial BMI and summer BMI growth,
but have less effect on school year BMI growth.
Table 2 estimates the association of BMI and BMI growth with
demographic covariates, and the Online Supporting Information esti-
mates the association between demographic covariates and growth in
overweight and obesity prevalence. Although most of the covariates
are significantly associated with initial BMI, none is significantly
associated with summer growth. The lack of demographic variation in
summer growth is consistent with results from a southeast Texas
school district (18), but differs from the results of the previous
national study (14), where summer BMI growth was faster for black
and Hispanic children.
Discussion
Between kindergarten and second grade, U.S. children’s overweight
and obesity prevalence increase only during summer vacations. This
finding suggests that the major risk factors for child obesity lie out-
side of schools. Schools may reduce risk in the relative sense that
they prevent overweight prevalence from increasing during the
school year as it does during the summer. Schools may even reduce
risk in an absolute sense, since obesity prevalence slightly declines
during kindergarten and second grade.
What behavioral changes explain the acceleration of BMI growth
during the summer? It is not clear whether children consume more
food energy in the summer (19), but they do sleep less (20), and
they watch more television (21). In addition, children in hot climates
are less physically active during summer, although children in cool
climates are more active (22). While these behaviors are suggestive,
it is challenging to correlate them with seasonal BMI patterns,
because seasonal measures of BMI and the relevant behaviors have
not been collected on the same children.
It is plausible that some out-of-school risk factors affect children not
just during the summer, but also after school and on weekends.
However, our data do not permit us to estimate weekend or after-
school BMI gains.
The question arises: if obesity prevalence increases only during
summer, how much more can schools do to reduce obesity? Many
school-based interventions have had little effect, and effective
school-based interventions tend to be those that do not just alter the
school environment but also involve parents (4) and try to change
out-of-school behaviors such as watching television (23). There may
also be underexploited potential in out-of-school interventions such
as summer camps (8), summer learning programs (7), parent nutri-
tion education (9), reductions in screen time (5), and reductions in
child-directed food marketing (6).O
