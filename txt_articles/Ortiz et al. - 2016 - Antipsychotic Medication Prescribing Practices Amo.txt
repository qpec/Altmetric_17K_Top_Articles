Antipsychotic Medication Prescribing Practices Among Adult
Patients Discharged From State Psychiatric Inpatient
Hospitals
Objectives: The goal of this study was to
explore antipsychotic medication prescribing
practices in a sample of 86,034 patients dis-
charged from state psychiatric inpatient hos-
pitals and to find the prevalence of patients
discharged
with
no
antipsychotic
medi-
cations, on antipsychotic monotherapy, and
on antipsychotic polypharmacy. For patients
discharged on antipsychotic polypharmacy,
the study explored the adjusted rates of anti-
psychotic polypharmacy, the reasons patients
were
discharged
on
antipsychotic
poly-
pharmacy, the proportion of antipsychotic
polypharmacy by mental health disorder, and
the characteristics associated with being dis-
charged on antipsychotic polypharmacy.
Methods: This cross-sectional study analyzed
all discharges for adult patients (18 to 64 y of
age) from state psychiatric inpatient hospitals
between January 1 and December 31, 2011. The
relationship among variables was explored
using χ2, t test, and analysis of variance.
Logistic regression was used to determine
predictors of antipsychotic polypharmacy.
Results: The prevalence of antipsychotic poly-
pharmacy was 12%. Of the discharged patients
receiving at least 1 antipsychotic medication
(adjusted rate), 18% were on antipsychotic
polypharmacy. The
strongest predictors of
antipsychotic polypharmacy being prescribed
were having a diagnosis of schizophrenia and a
length of stay of 90 days or more. Patients were
prescribed antipsychotic polypharmacy pri-
marily to reduce their symptoms.
Conclusions:
Antipsychotic
polypharmacy
continues at a high enough rate to affect
nearly 10,000 patients with a diagnosis of
schizophrenia each year in state psychiatric
inpatient hospitals. Further analysis of the
clinical presentation of these patients may
highlight particular aspects of the illness and
its previous treatment that are contributing to
practices outside the best-practice guideline.
An increased understanding of trend data,
patient characteristics, and national bench-
marks provides an opportunity for decision-
making that is sensitive to the patient’s needs
and cognizant of the hospital’s accomplish-
ments in adopting best practices.

 In fact, a number of treatment guidelines for
schizophrenia recommend against the use of anti-
psychotic polypharmacy or only endorse it as a last
resort after unsuccessful trials of monotherapy.4–8
There is clear evidence that antipsychotic poly-
pharmacy presents complications for the patient,
including risk of drug interactions, increased med-
ication side effects, increased risk for metabolic
disorders, and complex medication regimens, which
may
lead
to
medication
nonadherence
among
patients.2,3,9
Clinical, societal, and patient factors can perpetuate
the practice of antipsychotic polypharmacy.1,2,10–14
Clinical factors include side-effect management
and insufficient trials of monotherapy.2,13 A meas-
ure of the effectiveness of schizophrenia treatment
is reduction of positive symptoms, and antipsychotic
medications are the most effective means for ach-
ieving this outcome.15 However, negative symptoms
have a great impact on the everyday functioning of
persons with schizophrenia and there is a lack of
prescribing guidance to control these symptoms.15
Prescribing guidance also does not adequately
address the complexity of monotherapy trials for
persons with a long history of psychiatric illness,
previous medication attempts, and complex medical
comorbidity.
Societal factors include high patient-physician
ratios, a fragmented health care system, and pres-
sure to reduce hospital days. High patient-physi-
cian ratios reduce the amount of time a clinician can
spend assessing a patient,16 limiting information on
current and previous antipsychotic medication reg-
imens. A fragmented health care system can result
in a patient treated by >1 physician and, unless
there is care coordination, management of medi-
cation regimens can become complex. In addition,
clinicians are under pressure to shorten lengths of
hospitalization, which may contribute to prescrib-
ing >1 antipsychotic medication to achieve symp-
tom reduction more rapidly.1
Patient
factors
may
also
contribute
to
pre-
scription patterns. Some patients may not be
adhering to their medications as prescribed and, as
a result, they may continue to experience significant
schizophrenia symptoms. If the psychiatrist is
unaware of the patient’s behavior, which is partic-
ularly likely in outpatient settings in which medi-
cation administration is solely the responsibility of
the patient, then it is plausible that the outpatient
psychiatrist
may
resort
to
antipsychotic
poly-
pharmacy.12 In the inpatient setting, patients who
are admitted on a regimen of antipsychotic poly-
pharmacy may be continued on this regimen for
stabilization, while changing doses and combina-
tions are evaluated.
Over the past 10 years, several new antipsychotic
medications have come on the market. At the same
time, there has been a growing recognition that
antipsychotic polypharmacy needs to be brought to
the attention of physicians.17 In 2011, The Joint
Commission
(TJC)
began
requiring
psychiatric
inpatient
hospitals
to
monitor
the
number
of
patients
discharged
on
multiple
antipsychotic
medications
and
the
rationale
given
for
anti-
psychotic polypharmacy through 2 performance
measures from the Hospital Based Inpatient Psy-
chiatric Services (HBIPS) core measures set. TJC
used an expert panel that included physicians to
develop these measures and defined scientifically
validated
appropriate
justifications
for
poly-
pharmacy as: (1) a history of 3 or more failed anti-
psychotic monotherapy trials, (2) cross-titrating
antipsychotic medications to work toward mono-
therapy, or (3) the augmentation of clozapine.18
Previous research shows that when questionable
prescribing practices are brought into focus, they
are likely to change.11,19–22 Since the implementa-
tion of the HBIPS measures in 2011, there has been
a
nationwide
trend
toward
reduction
of
anti-
psychotic polypharmacy in psychiatric inpatient
hospitals.23
The existing literature on the characteristics of
antipsychotic polypharmacy includes studies based
on Medicaid claims data.24–28 The study described
in this article adds to the knowledge base by
examining data for adult patients discharged from
state psychiatric inpatient hospitals, who would be
excluded from Medicaid claims data due to the
Institute for Mental Disease Exclusion rule. This
rule states that any hospital having >16 beds, in
which >50% of the beds are occupied by persons
with a primary diagnosis of a mental disorder, is
excluded from Medicaid reimbursement for care
provided to patients who are 21 to 64 years of age.29
This study assessed the prescribing practices for
antipsychotic
medications
in
state
psychiatric
inpatient hospitals in 2011 to gain a national per-
spective on the prevalence and adjusted rates of
prescription of antipsychotic polypharmacy, the

 reasons for which antipsychotic polypharmacy was
prescribed, the most commonly prescribed combi-
nations
of
antipsychotic
medications,
and
the
patient characteristics associated with being dis-
charged on multiple antipsychotic medications.
Unlike other studies, this study examined anti-
psychotic prescribing practices for all discharged
adults, without preselecting by diagnosis. Trends
for state psychiatric inpatient hospitals and com-
parison with other psychiatric inpatient hospitals
are also explored. On the basis of this fuller
understanding of the factors that contribute to
antipsychotic polypharmacy, insights into quality
initiatives that could help further reduce the use of
antipsychotic polypharmacy are also provided.
METHOD
This
study
analyzed
data
extracted
from
the
Behavioral Healthcare Performance Measurement
System (BHPMS), a comprehensive proprietary
national database of the National Association of
State Mental Health Program Directors Research
Institute Inc. (NRI), comprised of patient-level data
submitted by state psychiatric inpatient hospitals
in the United States and its territories. Hospitals
extract patient-level data, including demographic
data, diagnosis, medications, and follow-up infor-
mation, from medical records and submit it to NRI’s
BHPMS on a monthly basis to participate in com-
mon measures of quality of care such as the HBIPS
performance measures. Hospitals submit patient-
level data in specified formats (known as data files)
as required by the BHPMS. The data files are
processed using high-quality standards (no missing
data for critical elements and <5% missing data for
noncritical elements) before being accepted into the
BHPMS Structured Query Language tables from
which the data files are extracted for analysis. Data
from 2 data files were used for the analysis descri-
bed in this article. The episode data file provides a
complete enumeration of unique episodes of care
(eg, hospitalizations) that occurred between the first
and the last days of a given month. The HBIPS data
file represents patients discharged from psychiatric
inpatient care during a given month, and hospitals
may provide a random sample of discharges. The
HBIPS data file consists of data that describe 5
content areas from the initial admission screening
process, 4 content areas from the continuing care
plan, and antipsychotic medications at discharge.
To comply with the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Federal pri-
vacy standards, all data extracted from NRI’s
BHPMS system were deidentified and anonymous.
All state psychiatric inpatient hospitals that par-
ticipate in NRI’s BHPMS sign a data-sharing
agreement that allows NRI’s researchers to use
limited data sets to conduct secondary research and
publicly disseminate the findings. This study was
approved by the NRI Institutional Review Board.
All analyses were conducted using the SPSS
statistical tool, version 22. All comparisons were
based on α set at P<0.01 (2-sided).
Procedure
Patient-level data analyzed for this study were
extracted from 2 linked data files within the BHPMS.
Demographic data (gender, race, age, marital status,
admission referral source, admission legal status,
discharge type, living situation at discharge, dis-
charge disposition, and Medicare coverage), admis-
sion date, discharge date, and mental health disorders
were extracted from the episode data file. The varia-
ble “age groups” was created by regrouping age data.
The “length of stay” variable was computed using
admission and discharge dates. The number of anti-
psychotic medications, the reason for multiple anti-
psychotic medications, and the names of antipsychotic
medications if provided were extracted from the
HBIPS data file. The data from the 2 data files were
linked using unique anonymous patient identifiers.
The HBIPS data were originally collected to cal-
culate hospitals’ performance rates for HBIPS per-
formance measures, 2 of which, HBIPS 4 and 5, are
related to antipsychotic polypharmacy: the defi-
nitions for the measures as defined by TJC are pre-
sented in Table 1. Data on the number of anti-
psychotic medications prescribed at discharge were
originally collected at a continuous level. The data
were then recoded to create a 3-level variable used for
study group comparisons among discharges: 0 anti-
psychotic medications; antipsychotic monotherapy;
and
antipsychotic
polypharmacy.
Antipsychotic
monotherapy was defined as the prescription of 1
antipsychotic medication at the time of discharge.
Antipsychotic polypharmacy was defined as the
coprescription of >1 antipsychotic medication for an

 individual patient. It is important to note that this
study did not assess all medications on which a
patient was discharged; the focus was only on anti-
psychotic medications.
To gain a better understanding of antipsychotic
polypharmacy, rates of polypharmacy were calcu-
lated in 2 ways. The prevalence or unadjusted
antipsychotic polypharmacy rate was calculated as
the number of discharges in which antipsychotic
polypharmacy was prescribed divided by the total
number of discharges during a given period. The
unadjusted polypharmacy rate therefore includes
patients who were not prescribed any antipsychotic
medication in the denominator. To allow for better
comparison across hospitals and to reinforce best
practices, an adjusted polypharmacy rate was also
calculated as follows: the number of discharges in
which antipsychotic polypharmacy was prescribed
divided by the number of discharges in which at
least 1 antipsychotic medication was prescribed
during a given period. The adjusted polypharmacy
rate was defined in the HBIPS 4 measure and is
used in public reporting by both TJC and the Cen-
ters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).
Unadjusted
and
adjusted
antipsychotic
poly-
pharmacy rates are provided for total populations
as well as for demographic or clinical subgroups.
Study Population and Sample
The secondary analysis described in this article
examined
the
use
of
antipsychotic
medications
among a national sample of state psychiatric inpa-
tient hospitals. State psychiatric inpatient hospitals
included in the study were enrolled in NRI’s BHPMS
and participating in the HBIPS core measure data
set at the time of the study; these hospitals repre-
sented approximately 80% of all state psychiatric
inpatient hospitals serving adults. The study sample
consisted of all discharges of adults 18 to 64 years of
age between January 1 and December 31, 2011 for
whom HBIPS data were provided. Although hospi-
tals are permitted to provide a random sample of
discharges, 83% of the hospitals provided complete
data resulting in a study sample representing 78% of
all discharges of adults from these hospitals. No
exclusions were applied to the discharges that met
the age requirement.
Mental Health Disorders
Hospitals submitted the mental health diagnosis
codes active at the time of discharge using the
International Classification of Diseases 9th Version,
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). A mental health
disorder multilevel variable was created based on
the frequency of the mental health disorders among
patients. The hierarchy of mental health disorders
was defined using the following 6 clusters: schizo-
phrenia, depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, other
psychoses, personality disorder, and anxiety dis-
order. A “no mental health disorder/other mental
health disorders” category was created for those
patients in whom none of those 6 diagnostic clusters
was identified. Appendix A (http://links.lww.com/
JPP/A9) shows the specific diagnostic codes asso-
ciated with each diagnostic cluster. A patient’s pri-
mary,
secondary,
and
tertiary
diagnoses
were
reviewed to assign the patient to the appropriate
cluster.

 Other Characteristics
This
study
also
explored
differences
in
anti-
psychotic
medication
prescribing
practices
by
region. The hospital’s location (state) was used to
categorize discharges from hospitals as being in the
Northeast, South, West, or Midwest. Appendix B
shows the list of states by region (http://links.lww.
com/JPP/A9).
The study also explored differences based on the
calendar quarter of the discharges (1Q2011 through
4Q2011) to determine whether differences in med-
ication prescribing practices occurred over time.
The date of discharge was used to classify each
discharge into a calendar quarter.
Descriptive Analysis
Cross tabulation determined the proportion of dis-
charges with
no
antipsychotic
medication pre-
scribed, with antipsychotic monotherapy, and with
antipsychotic polypharmacy by demographic cova-
riates (gender, race, age, marital status, admission
referral source, admission legal status, discharge
type, living situation at discharge, discharge dis-
position, Medicare coverage, and length of stay) and
by mental health disorder. Cross tabulation, t test,
and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were also used to
determine
interaction
among
the
demographic
covariates. Mean comparisons were used to analyze
the differences among study groups by age and
length of stay at the continuous level. The χ2 test
was used to evaluate for significant differences in
antipsychotic
medication
prescribing
by
study
region and by study quarter. Antipsychotic medi-
cation prescription practices were also investigated
along the continuous age spectrum.
Further analyses were performed using data from
the group who were discharged on antipsychotic
polypharmacy.
The
percentage
of
antipsychotic
polypharmacy in each participating state psychi-
atric inpatient hospital was explored and compared
with the mean and median rates for the nation. The
χ2 analysis was used to evaluate the prevalence of
antipsychotic
polypharmacy
among
discharged
patients by mental health disorder and by study
period. The reasons adult patients were discharged
on antipsychotic polypharmacy were also explored.
Hospitals have the option of reporting the names of
the antipsychotic medications that are prescribed,
and these data were used to evaluate the most
frequent antipsychotic medication combinations.
Inferential Analysis
A binary logistic regression determined the like-
lihood of antipsychotic polypharmacy in a dis-
charged sample. The logistic regression model
included patient characteristics that were both
available through NRI’s BHPMS, and that are
common
to
other
data
systems
(eg,
available
through TJC or through the CMS data systems).
The use of this model assured that it could be
replicated using a different data source or sample.
Patient characteristics were entered in 4 steps. Step
1 included gender, age group, length of stay, and
mental health disorders. Step 2 added Medicare
coverage. Step 3 added discharge disposition. Step 4
added the interaction terms between each mental
health disorder and length of stay. Odds ratios (95%
confidence intervals) and P-values were calculated.
RESULTS
This study analyzed data from 86,034 discharges
from 160 state psychiatric inpatient hospitals in 46
states and territories during calendar year 2011.
The characteristics for patients discharged on no
antipsychotic,
antipsychotic
monotherapy,
and
antipsychotic
polypharmacy
are
presented
in
Table 2. Overall, the sample included a higher
proportion of male (63%), white (58%), and never
married (66%) patients. Discharged patients were,
on average, 38 years old with an average length of
stay of 116 days. Most discharged patients had an
involuntary admission (89%), and one third of the
patients
were
referred
by
the
justice
system.
Eighty-five
percent
of
patients
had
completed
inpatient treatment at the time of discharge and
57% were discharged to a private house. Forty
percent of the patients had a diagnosis of schizo-
phrenia, followed by depressive disorders (24%),
bipolar disorder (11%), other psychoses (6%), per-
sonality disorder (5%), and anxiety disorder (3%).
Eleven percent were discharged with no mental
health disorder or with a disorder not covered in
this study.
Among all discharges, 32% were not prescribed
an antipsychotic medication at discharge, 56% were

ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATION PRESCRIBING PRACTICES
 prescribed antipsychotic monotherapy, and 12%
(unadjusted rate) were prescribed antipsychotic
polypharmacy. Of the patients discharged with at
least 1 antipsychotic medication, 18% were dis-
charged on antipsychotic polypharmacy (adjusted
antipsychotic polypharmacy rate).
Statistical analysis showed that patients who
were male (67%), white (53%), 45 to 64 years old
(37%), never married (76%), referred by the justice
system (32%), discharged to a residential setting
other than home or jail (48%), not covered by
Medicare (49%), with longer stays or length of stays
of 90 days or more (39%), and with a diagnosis of
schizophrenia (75%) were disproportionately dis-
charged on antipsychotic polypharmacy compared
with the other categories in each characteristic.
Patients discharged on no antipsychotic medication
had significantly shorter lengths of stay (76 d)
compared with patients discharged on antipsychotic
monotherapy (106 d), and patients discharged on
antipsychotic polypharmacy (265 d).
Differences by diagnosis cluster were also found.
Patients
in
the
group
with
schizophrenia
(22,445/34,476), bipolar disorder (6044/9373), or
other psychoses (3818/5455) were more likely to be
discharged on antipsychotic monotherapy. Patients
in the group with a depressive disorder (9990-
/20,252), anxiety disorder (1170/2245), or person-
ality disorder (2139/4336) and patients with no
mental health disorder/other disorder (6286/9897)
were more likely to be discharged with no anti-
psychotic medication.
Given these relationships between antipsychotic
polypharmacy and gender, race, age, marital status,
admission referral source, living situation at dis-
charge, Medicare coverage, and length of stay,
bivariate
relationships
among
these
covariates
were assessed (Appendix C) (http://links.lww.com/
JPP/A9). Overall, marital status (never having been
married) was found to be related to gender (male;
χ2
2=3283.73, P<0.01), to race (African American;
χ2
6=2839.33,
P<0.01),
to
younger
age
(35 y
or
younger; F2,84,674=6921.43, P<0.01), and to longer
length of stay (137 d or more; F2,84,674=135.56,
P<0.01). Gender (female) was related to older age
(39 y and older; t86,015=23.56, P<0.01), and to
shorter length of stay (83 d or less; t86,015=13.52,
P<0.01). White race was related to older age (39 y
and older; F3,85,860=294.63, P<0.01), and African
American race was related to longer length of stay
(147 d or more; F3,85,860=37.97, P<0.01). Length of
stay tended to increase with an increase in age
(F4,86,033=267.78, P<0.01).
Prevalence of Prescription of Antipsychotic
Medication by Study Region and by Study
Quarter
Discharges on antipsychotic monotherapy (61%;
24,421/40,169) prevailed in the South. The North-
east region had the highest proportion of patients
discharged on antipsychotic polypharmacy (20%;
2522/12,895) (Fig. 1). Given an unadjusted poly-
pharmacy rate almost twice that of the other
regions, analysis of patient characteristics indicated
that significantly more patients in the Northeast
region were older, had longer lengths of stay, and
had a higher rate of schizophrenia diagnoses com-
pared with the other regions, all factors previously
shown to be related to higher rates of antipsychotic
polypharmacy. Finally, the West region discharged
the highest proportion of patients (45%; 5714/12,730)
on no antipsychotic medication. When using the
adjusted antipsychotic polypharmacy rate, the dif-
ference across regions was markedly lower with the
Northeast region having the highest rate (26%;
2522/9769), and the South having the lowest rate
(15%; 4239/28,660), and the Midwest (2645/13,166)
and the West (1398/7016) regions falling in the
middle (20%).
No significant differences were found in the rate
of antipsychotic polypharmacy among discharges by
study
quarter.
However,
in
all
quarters,
the
majority of patients were discharged on anti-
psychotic monotherapy.

ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATION PRESCRIBING PRACTICES
 Prevalence of Prescription of Antipsychotic
Medication by Patient Age
The prevalence of antipsychotic medication prescribing
practices along the age continuum was also explored
(Fig. 2). The majority of patients were discharged on
antipsychotic monotherapy. The slight upward trend of
discharged patients on antipsychotic polypharmacy
was constant as age increased. The prevalence of no
antipsychotic medication being prescribed decreased
with an increase in age. Increased age of a patient was
positively associated with an increased likelihood of
receiving antipsychotic polypharmacy.
Percent of Polypharmacy in Each State
Psychiatric Inpatient Hospital
Discharges from hospitals ranged from 2 to 3308,
with an average of 538 discharges, and a median of
317 discharges per hospital in 2011. Hospitals dis-
charged between 0% and 57% of their patients on
antipsychotic polypharmacy (unadjusted rate), with
an average of 17% and a median of 15% on anti-
psychotic polypharmacy (Fig. 3).
Reasons for Discharging Patients on
Antipsychotic Polypharmacy
Patients were discharged on antipsychotic poly-
pharmacy mainly to reduce symptoms (37%), due to
a history of a minimum of 3 or more failed trials of
monotherapy (19%), and due to a recommended
plan to taper to monotherapy (10%). Although the
patterns were relatively constant across patient
ages,
some
notable
differences
were
identified
(Fig. 4). A history of 3 or more failed trails of
monotherapy was more prevalent in older than
younger patients. A recommended plan to taper to
monotherapy was more prevalent in young adults
(18 to 22 y of age) than in other adults.
Antipsychotic Polypharmacy and Mental
Health Disorders
Among patients discharged on antipsychotic poly-
pharmacy, the majority had a diagnosis of schizo-
phrenia (Table 3). Overall, 23% (8059/34,476) of
patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were
discharged on antipsychotic polypharmacy com-
pared with 5% to 7% for all other diagnoses under
study, nearly a 5-fold difference. However, the

 adjusted polypharmacy rate by diagnosis indicates
a 2.6-fold difference.
Antipsychotic Polypharmacy Medication
Combinations
Although the names of specific antipsychotic medi-
cations is optional information provided by the hos-
pitals, data concerning specific medications were
provided for nearly half of the patients discharged on
antipsychotic polypharmacy. However, this was not
a random representation of patients as several large
states chose not to report these optional data.
Therefore, analysis of medication combinations was
not advisable as results would not be representative.
Likelihood of Antipsychotic Polypharmacy in
a Discharged Sample
Table 4 presents the results of the logistic regression,
using characteristics associated with being discharged
on antipsychotic polypharmacy. The strongest charac-
teristics were length of stay and a diagnosis of schizo-
phrenia. Although gender, age, and Medicare coverage
were found to be significantly related to antipsychotic
polypharmacy, their importance was removed when
including length of stay and diagnosis. When discharge
disposition was added (Step 3), patients discharged to
other (health care facilities) were more likely to be
discharged on antipsychotic polypharmacy. When
length of stay and diagnosis were entered as inter-
action terms (Step 4), the likelihood of a patient being
discharged on antipsychotic polypharmacy almost
doubled, reaching nearly 10 times the likelihood of
receiving antipsychotic polypharmacy for patients with
length of stay >90 days compared with extremely short
stays and >8 times the likelihood for patients with a
diagnosis of schizophrenia compared with others.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
prevalence of antipsychotic polypharmacy in a
national sample of discharges from state psychiatric
inpatient hospitals. It was found that the overall
antipsychotic polypharmacy rate was 12%, with an
adjusted rate of 18% for patients who were dis-
charged on 1 or more antipsychotic medications.
These rates were comparable with polypharmacy

 rates reported in the literature, such as 21% in
Medicaid claims,22 and 14% for outpatients on
Medicaid.26 In this study, the antipsychotic poly-
pharmacy rate was higher (23%) for patients dis-
charged with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, with an
adjusted rate of 26% for patients with schizophrenia
who were discharged on 1 or more antipsychotic
medications. In 2011, the first year of reporting the
HBIPS 4 measure, the national adjusted poly-
pharmacy rate reported by TJC for adults 18 to
64 years of age was 15%. A comparable study per-
formed in a New York state psychiatric inpatient
hospital, which included only patients with a diag-
nosis of schizophrenia, found rates of 22% for anti-
psychotic polypharmacy with second generation
antipsychotics at baseline, which underrepresents
total antipsychotic polypharmacy as it does not
include patients receiving first-generation agents.30
Antipsychotics
are
prescribed
to
decrease
symptoms and suffering and, ideally, improve func-
tioning,31 with symptom reduction the standard
measure of therapeutic efficacy.15 This study found
that clinicians reported using antipsychotic poly-
pharmacy primarily to reduce patients’ symptoms
(37%), which is consistent with other findings.3,32
Given the high prevalence of this rationale, addi-
tional studies may be needed to determine whether
there is a new science base for this justification for
patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. This
finding, however, also poses concerns when the
appropriateness of this rationale is not scientifically
validated and also demonstrates lower performance
on the publicly reported measures of antipsychotic
medication use (HBIPS 4 and 5).18 As hospitals are
required to report their performance on standardized
core measures,19 the implication of not meeting
minimum requirements from payers and accred-
itation agencies will result in below-target measure
rates. TJC uses the HBIPS 5 measure rate in a
hospital’s overall evaluation of performance, with
a target of 85% compliance on best practices for
all patients and all conditions.33 In the future,
the CMS Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Quality
Reporting Program is expected to move from a pay-
for-reporting model
to pay-for-performance, and
consequently failure to meet minimum performance
thresholds will result in reduced funding.
This study found that 36% of patients receiving
antipsychotic polypharmacy had one of the recog-
nized appropriate justifications according to TJC
standards: 19% had a history of a minimum of 3 or
more failed trials of monotherapy, 10% were rec-
ommended a plan to taper to monotherapy, and 7%
were in clozapine augmentation. Although multiple
and unsuccessful trials of monotherapy and aug-
mentation of clozapine were justified by clinical
guidance and research studies, recommending a
taper to monotherapy reflects a reality of con-
temporary inpatient psychiatric care.19 However,
these justifications were developed on the basis of
analysis of already published studies that included
only patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
disorder who were not necessarily receiving psy-
chiatric services in inpatient settings.19 In this
study, 75% of the patients on antipsychotic poly-
pharmacy had a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The low
percentages for the 3 appropriate justifications
suggest that implementation of the proposed best
practices are taking place at a low rate. It could also
suggest the need for accreditation agencies to revise
and validate current standards and definitions of
measures that could be more appropriate for psy-
chiatric inpatient hospitals.
Because of lack of reporting of the names of
antipsychotic medications (optional data) from the
larger states in the sample, analysis of anti-
psychotic
medication
combinations
was
con-
strained. The rationale of clozapine augmentation
was provided for only 7% of discharges in which
antipsychotic
polypharmacy
was
prescribed.
A
study using a similar population in state psychiatric
inpatient hospitals found that augmentation of
clozapine was provided to <50% of patients com-
pared with augmentation of risperidone (to 69%
of patients) and olanzapine (to 91%),30 which is
counter to current clinical guidelines for patients
with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.15,34,35 These
findings support suggestions that antipsychotic
polypharmacy is often tried before clozapine mono-
therapy,28
clozapine
utilization
is
low,15
and
current guidelines for polypharmacy do not repre-
sent usual practice for patients with severe mental
illness.
Our findings showed that rates of antipsychotic
polypharmacy differ by geographic region. The
Northeast had the highest adjusted polypharmacy
rate, with 26% of patients discharged on anti-
psychotic
polypharmacy.
In
the
West,
45%
of
patients were discharged on no antipsychotic med-
ications,
which
converted
to
an
adjusted
294
July 2016

ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATION PRESCRIBING PRACTICES
 polypharmacy rate of 20%. Although patient char-
acteristics were highlighted to interpret a higher
rate of polypharmacy in the Northeast, regional
differences warrant further research to determine
the causes of the variation and potentially the
implementation of best practices to reduce anti-
psychotic polypharmacy.
On the basis of the logistic regression, the stron-
gest predictors for patients being discharged on
antipsychotic polypharmacy were a length of stay of
90 days or more and a diagnosis of schizophrenia.
These 2 characteristics almost double the risk effect
when the interaction terms between them were
included in the model. State psychiatric inpatient
hospitals have a significant proportion of patients
with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (40%) and nearly
20% of patients who experience a longer hospital
stay, suggesting a high-risk population needing
special attention. Patients with depressive disorders
were not at risk of antipsychotic polypharmacy and
were as likely to receive no antipsychotic medi-
cations as antipsychotic monotherapy, which is con-
sistent with the Food and Drug Administration’s
2006 approval for the use of antipsychotic medi-
cations with treatment-resistant major depressive
episodes.
Limitations
This study had a number of limitations. The study
group consisted of patients discharged from 160
state
psychiatric
inpatient
hospitals
across
46
states and territories, representing 80% of all state
psychiatric
inpatient
hospitals
for
adults.
In
reporting on the HBIPS measures, hospitals are
permitted to randomly select a sample of discharges
in each month where the sampling methods would
provide a representative sample of the original
population. The vast majority of state psychiatric
inpatient hospitals do not submit a random sample
for the HBIPS measures but rather provide com-
plete data. Therefore only data from the hospitals
that provided complete data were included in this
study, representing 78% of all state psychiatric
inpatient discharges in 2011. This study used dis-
charges, not a unique count of patients; therefore
comparisons for patients with long-term episodes of
care and patients with multiple episode of care were
not undertaken. However, it is known that long-
term residents represent 21% of the total episodes
of care in a given year in state psychiatric inpatient
hospitals.36 The publicly posted HBIPS 4 and 5
measures include only patients with planned dis-
charges; therefore comparisons with the adjusted
rate for the study group do not address the
unknown percentage of unplanned discharges, for
example, when a patient leaves against medical
advice or is released by the judicial system. Data
available for the study allow an assessment of the
prescribing
practices for
multiple
antipsychotic
medications at discharge. The number of anti-
psychotic medications on admission and changes in
medications during the hospital stay are unknown
and would be an area for further study. Anecdotal
evidence from some state psychiatric inpatient
hospitals indicates that there has been a move to
reduce the number of antipsychotic medications
during the stay from 3 or more down to 2 agents at
discharge, with the ultimate goal of further stabi-
lization and a reduction to monotherapy in collab-
oration with the outpatient provider. Information
on patients’ adherence to medication regimens
involving multiple antipsychotics after discharge is
unknown and would be an area for further study.
Finally, this study focused on state psychiatric
inpatient hospitals which could limit the general-
izability of the findings to other psychiatric inpa-
tient providers. Nevertheless, the study provides
foundational data for this particular population
which
is
greatly
overlooked
in
the
current
literature.
CONCLUSIONS
Overall, the adjusted antipsychotic polypharmacy
rate reported by TJC has decreased from 15% in
2011 to 13% in 201323 across nearly 600 psychiatric
hospitals. CMS provided its first reporting of the
adjusted polypharmacy rate for 2013 at 11% for
adults 18 to 64 years of age across >1600 psychi-
atric hospitals.37 The prevalence of antipsychotic
polypharmacy is thus an issue that needs continued
attention.
This study found that the most significant fac-
tors contributing to higher rates of antipsychotic
polypharmacy were a diagnosis of schizophrenia
and
longer
hospitalizations.

symptom reduction was provided as often as all

 polypharmacy combined (a history of 3 or more
failed
antipsychotic
monotherapy
trials,
cross-
titrating antipsychotic medications to work toward
monotherapy, or the augmentation of clozapine).
Given this fuller understanding of the factors
contributing
to
antipsychotic
polypharmacy
in
state psychiatric inpatient hospitals, some insights
into quality initiatives that could help further
reduce the use of antipsychotic polypharmacy can
be gained.
Antipsychotic
polypharmacy
continues
at
a
high enough rate to impact nearly 10,000 patients
with a diagnosis of schizophrenia each year in
state psychiatric inpatient hospitals. Given such a
large sample,
further
analysis of
the clinical
presentations of these patients may highlight
particular aspects of the illness and its previous
treatment that are contributing to practices out-
side the best practice guidelines. Patients with
multiple hospitalizations and patients with long
hospitalizations may have such complex medical
record documentation that information from pre-
vious stays has been purged, limiting the extent of
the
previous
antipsychotic
medication
history
available to the current physician. Thus, failed
trials of monotherapy may be difficult or nearly
impossible to abstract from a patient’s record.
Physician grand rounds may be an avenue for
further understanding the clinical rationales for
both medication choices as well as polypharmacy.
Physician consultation may be another avenue for
developing strategies to reduce the number of
antipsychotic medications during the hospital-
ization while maintaining functioning. Admin-
istrative policies may also have affected formulary
options
for
physicians,
resulting
in
the
anti-
psychotic medication prescribing profile observed
in this study. Basing these discussions on objective
data that include trends over time, patient char-
acteristics, and national benchmarks provides an
opportunity for informed decision-making that is
sensitive to the needs of patients and cognizant of
other
hospitals’
accomplishments
toward
best
practices.
