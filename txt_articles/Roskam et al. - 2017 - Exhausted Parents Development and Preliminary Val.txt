Can parents burn out? The aim of this research was to examine the construct validity
of the concept of parental burnout and to provide researchers which an instrument to
measure it. We conducted two successive questionnaire-based online studies, the first
with a community-sample of 379 parents using principal component analyses and the
second with a community- sample of 1,723 parents using both principal component
analyses and confirmatory factor analyses. We investigated whether the tridimensional
structure of the burnout syndrome (i.e., exhaustion, inefficacy, and depersonalization)
held in the parental context. We then examined the specificity of parental burnout
vis-à-vis professional burnout assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory, parental
stress assessed with the Parental Stress Questionnaire and depression assessed with the
Beck Depression Inventory. The results support the validity of a tri-dimensional burnout
syndrome including exhaustion, inefficacy and emotional distancing with, respectively,
53.96 and 55.76% variance explained in study 1 and study 2, and reliability ranging from
0.89 to 0.94. The final version of the Parental Burnout Inventory (PBI) consists of 22
items and displays strong psychometric properties (CFI = 0.95, RMSEA = 0.06). Low
to moderate correlations between parental burnout and professional burnout, parental
stress and depression suggests that parental burnout is not just burnout, stress or
depression. The prevalence of parental burnout confirms that some parents are so
exhausted that the term “burnout” is appropriate. The proportion of burnout parents lies
somewhere between 2 and 12%. The results are discussed in light of their implications
at the micro-, meso- and macro-levels.

INTRODUCTION
Imagine Cecilia, a nurse who used to be very engaged in her job. She was well aware of the
importance of her mission and strove to provide good emotional and medical care to her patients.
She gave the best she could each and every day. For years, she coped with the heavy workload, the
tiring shift work schedule and the poor rewards for her efforts. But over recent months, she has had
to work even harder: one of her colleagues is on maternity leave and another one is a newcomer
who has not yet mastered the tasks of the role. Her workload has increased drastically and her boss
does not share the burden. She feels more and more exhausted. As she lacks the time to do her work
properly, she keeps the care she provides to a strict minimum: patients’ physical care. She does not
have the time or energy to listen to or deal with patients’ emotional difficulties. She has gradually

Parental Burnout Inventory
started to consider patients as “rooms” rather than humans. As
time passes, she is becoming less and less happy and people are
starting to complain about her work. Most psychologists and
general practitioners would detect that Cecilia is suffering from
job burnout. She presents all three core symptoms of burnout:
she is emotionally exhausted, she depersonalizes her patients and
she is less efficient.
Now imagine Charlotte, a mother of three children who used
to be there all the time for them. She was well aware of the
importance of parenting and strove to provide them with optimal
care and support in every way. She gave the best she could each
and every day. For years, she looked after them, drove them to
school and to extra-curricular activities, prepared meals, oversaw
their homework, and was there for them in their happiness and
sorrows. But over recent months, things have become difficult.
Her eldest child has had an accident and needs physical therapy
three times a week. Her youngest has entered primary school
and is experiencing severe learning difficulties. Her workload
as a mom has dramatically increased and her husband cannot
share the burden. He comes back home late in the evening
and frequently travels abroad. Charlotte feels more and more
exhausted. She strives to maintain the routine: work, journeys,
meals, and homework. But she does not have the time or energy
to spend quality time with the children, and still less to listen to
or deal with their emotional difficulties. She has become cold and
irritable, and the children complain that she is not “the same as
she used to be.” She feels like she is a terrible mother. Is Charlotte
suffering from parental burnout?
Although the parallel between the above situations is obvious,
and although many popular authors and a few scientists have
already suggested the existence of parental burnout (Pelsma,
1989; Norberg, 2007, 2010; Lindström et al., 2011; Lindahl
Norberg et al., 2014), the claim that Charlotte suffers from
“parental burnout” can only be justified if two conditions are met.
The first is that parental burnout can be precisely defined and
specifically measured. And the second is that Charlotte meets
the criteria and scores above the clinical cut-off level. Neither
of these conditions has been met so far. Although we know,
thanks to seminal work by Pelsma (1989) and by Norberg et al.
(Norberg, 2007, 2010; Lindström et al., 2011; Lindahl Norberg
et al., 2014), that parents can burnout because of parental issues,
it is still debatable whether a specific diagnosis of “parental
burnout” makes sense. Moreover, although Pelsma paved the way
by suggesting that the Maslach Burnout Inventory may be a good
starting point to build a measure of parental burnout, we do not
yet have a fully validated instrument for this purpose.
Accepting the existence of parental burnout requires both
proximity to and distinctiveness from job burnout. Conceptually
speaking, the first condition to validate the existence of “parental
burnout” is to show that the tridimensional structure of
the burnout syndrome (i.e., exhaustion, depersonalization and
inefficacy) can also be found in the case of “parental burnout”
when all items refer unambiguously to the parental context.
This is not self-evident (Pelsma, 1989), but is nonetheless a
prerequisite to call parental burnout “burnout.” Provided that the
first condition is met, the second condition is to demonstrate the
distinctiveness of parental burnout from professional burnout.
If this is not the case, we will have to conclude that there is
a generic, context-free “burnout” phenomenon. This may also
be theoretically problematic for the construct of professional
burnout. The third condition is to show that parental burnout
is something other than just parental stress or depression.
Because burnout is situated on a continuum between stress
and depression (Iacovides et al., 2003; Hakanen et al., 2008),
a partial overlap is expected, but it should be moderate. If all
these three conditions are met, the last condition is to show
that “parental burnout,” as its name suggests, is not limited to
mothers; otherwise it should be named “maternal burnout” or
“mothering burnout.”
In light of the foregoing, the aim of this research was to
examine the construct validity of the concept of parental burnout
and, should it be deemed valid, to provide researchers with
an instrument to measure it. We accumulated theoretical and
empirical evidence in favor of the existence of parental burnout.
Before presenting the empirical research and results, we shall
briefly introduce the notion of job burnout. In addition to
being helpful for readers who are not familiar with job burnout
research, this will allow them to realize the parallels that can be
drawn between job burnout and parental burnout.
THE NOTION OF BURNOUT
As will be the case for parental burnout, the use of the term
“burnout” and lay descriptions of the syndrome appeared
before the scientific community took it up as an object of
study. As pointed out by Maslach and Leiter, “the importance
of [job] burnout as a social problem was identified by both
practitioners and social commentators long before it became a
focus of systematic study by researchers” (Maslach et al., 2001,
p. 398). Another salient parallel with parental burnout is that
the increasing prevalence of job burnout in the workplace since
the 70s was preceded by a number of socio-cultural changes that
resulted in fundamental transformations in the workplace and
the nature of jobs (Maslach and Leiter, 1997; Schaufeli et al.,
2009). As we will explain in the section on parental burnout,
these changes were mirrored in the parental context a few
decades later, and it is no coincidence that parental burnout
emerged in the 2000s.
Although cases of burnout were described and analyzed by
Freudenberger (1974), it is to Maslach (1976) that we owe
the conceptualization of burnout that still prevails. After 10
years of qualitative and quantitative research, she proposed a
conceptualization of job burnout as a psychological syndrome
encompassing three key dimensions: overwhelming exhaustion,
a depersonalization of the beneficiaries of one’s work, and a
sense of ineffectiveness and lack of accomplishment (Maslach
and Jackson, 1981; Maslach, 1993). The exhaustion component
represents the core dimension of burnout. It refers to feelings of
being overextended and depleted of one’s emotional and physical
resources. The depersonalization component refers to a negative,
callous, or excessively detached response to various aspects of the
job, including the beneficiaries of one’s work. The component
of reduced efficacy or accomplishment refers to feelings of

incompetence and a lack of achievement and productivity at work
(Maslach et al., 2001).
FROM JOB BURNOUT TO PARENTAL
BURNOUT
The first traceable account of parental burnout dates from 1983 in
the testimony of Edith Lanstrom, a Christian mother, in her book
Christian parent burnout. That same year, a university professor
specializing in educational leadership published a book together
with a leadership consultant with whom he was conducting
workshops on job burnout. The book, entitled Parent burnout,
argued that parenting can lead to exhaustion to such a degree that
it could be called burnout (Procaccini and Kiefaver, 1983). The
authors concurred with Freudenberger’s individualistic vision of
the etiology of burnout: parents who burn out are those who
looked forward to parenthood the most, who give it their all,
in a word: overcommitted, overzealous parents. A few years
later, Pelsma examined the validity of the Maslach Burnout
Inventory for assessing parental burnout in a 100 non-working
mothers of young children. He found support for two of the
three dimensions (emotional exhaustion and lack of personal
accomplishment) but not for the third one (depersonalization).
The paper was published in 1989 but remained largely unnoticed.
Apart from these three accounts, there was no other publication
on the subject until the 2000s. At that time, the topic of parental
burnout did not seem to resonate in the target audience.
While the job burnout wave hit the USA in the 70s, the
parental burnout wave hit Europe in the 2000s. Interestingly, the
socio-cultural changes that occurred in the parenting domain in
the 90s in Europe seemed to mirror the changes in the human
services work domain in the USA in the 60s (see Schaufeli et al.,
2009 for a brief account of the latter). The changes in the human
services work comprised five elements: firstly, the definition by
the state authorities of a noble target (the War on poverty decreed
by President Johnson in 1964) that was impossible to reach
in practice (there will always be poverty), leading to frustrated
idealism. Secondly, and relatedly, the increased state incursion in
job descriptions: jobs that were originally a “calling” began to be
highly formalized. Thirdly, the weakened professional authority
of human services workers (doctors, nurses, teachers, police
officers, etc.) gradually resulted in less respect from beneficiaries
(see e.g., Pescosolido et al., 2001). Fourthly, the expectations of
empowered beneficiaries regarding care, service, empathy and
compassion rose drastically (see e.g., Lateef, 2011). Fifthly, the
economic crises of the 1970s meant that people were trying to
achieve these impossible goals with fewer resources (in terms of
equipment, personnel, etc.).
The very same factors were at play in the parenting domain
in the decade preceding the emergence of the term “parenting
burnout” in the media in Europe. Firstly, the definition by the
state authorities of a noble target (Positive parenting, consisting
of non-violent, warm, supportive and sensitive parenting valuing
children as people in their own rights, as decreed by the
Council of Europe in 2007, Daly, 2007), that was impossible to
reach in practice (it is impossible to apply all these principles
at all times), leading to frustrated idealism. Secondly, and
relatedly, the increased state incursion in parenthood: while
parenting was formerly done with love and common sense,
the exercise of parental authority became increasingly a subject
of legislation (e.g., spanking legislation, duRivage et al., 2015).
Thirdly, the weakened authority of parents (due to a focus on
children’s rights and parents’ duties) resulted in less respect
from children (Richards, 2010). Fourthly, the expectations of
empowered children in terms of attention, education, possessions
and opportunities rose drastically (Daly, 2007). Fifthly, the
drastic increase in woman’s work (+75% between 1980 and 2010;
ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics) meant that parents were trying
to achieve these impossible goals with less time.
In summary, the increased pressure on parents, combined
with the lack of time due to the drastic decrease in stay-
at-home mothers and the lower respect and/or appreciation
from children, has made parenting increasingly challenging.
It is therefore no coincidence that parental burnout emerged
in Europe in the 2000s. As was the case with job burnout,
practitioners and journalists identified the importance of parental
burnout before it became a focus of systematic study by
researchers. It has not yet become a central focus for researchers,
but research has started to emerge. In 2007, Norberg assessed
burnout using the Shirom–Melamed Burnout Questionnaire
(SMBQ) among 24 mothers and 20 fathers of childhood brain
tumor survivors, and compared their scores to those of parents
of children with no history of chronic or serious diseases
(Norberg, 2007). Mothers’ burnout scores were significantly
higher compared to those of reference mothers. There was
a non-significant tendency in the same direction for fathers.
In 2010, her team replicated these results on a sample of
252 parents of children with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and
38 parents of children with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,
whose scores on the SMBQ were compared to that of 124
randomly selected parents of healthy children. Again, mothers’
burnout scores were significantly higher compared with reference
mothers; for fathers, there was only a non-significant tendency
in the same direction (Lindström et al., 2011). In a follow-up
study carried out 7 months later on the parents of childhood
brain tumor survivors, Norberg (2010) showed that burnout
was predicted by parents’ perception of the influence of the
disease on their everyday life. These results were refined in
another publication about the sample of parents of children
with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, in which the team showed that
the predictors of parental burnout were not sociodemographic
or medical factors but low social support, lack of leisure
time, financial concerns and a perception that the child’s
disease affected everyday life. Additional predictors in mothers
were low self-esteem and high need for control (Lindström
et al., 2011). In their last study (Lindahl Norberg et al.,
2014), they compared the SMBQ scores of 159 mothers and
123 fathers of children who had undergone and survived
pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
Burnout occurred more often among fathers of children who
had undergone transplantation within the last 5 years than
among fathers of children with no history of serious disease.
Among both mothers and fathers, burnout was predicted by the

Parental Burnout Inventory
child’s number and severity of health impairments during these 5
years.
Although these studies strongly suggest the existence of
parental burnout, its existence cannot be formally ascertained
yet, because the questionnaire used to measure burnout (MSBQ)
contains 10 context-free items (e.g., I feel fed up; I feel physically
drained; my thinking process is slow) and four job-related
items (e.g., I feel I am not capable of investing emotionally
in coworkers and customers). Therefore, these studies do not
provide information about the validity and specificity of parental
burnout or on the prevalence of this specific form of burnout
in the general population. Note that although this is a weakness
from the standpoint of parental burnout research, it is not a
weakness of these studies per se, as they did not intend to
document the existence of parental burnout; rather, they sought
to show how much and for how long parents could be affected by
children’s severe health issues, even after the child’s recovery.
AIM OF THE CURRENT RESEARCH
The aim of this research was to examine the construct validity
of the concept of parental burnout and, should it be deemed
valid, to provide researchers with an instrument to measure it,
as well as norms to interpret scores in an exploratory way. To this
end, we first investigated whether the tridimensional structure
of the burnout syndrome (i.e., exhaustion, depersonalization and
inefficacy) could also be found in the case of “parental burnout.”
We then examined the specificity of parental burnout vis-à-vis
professional burnout, parental stress and depression. Next, we
checked if parental burnout concerned both genders or if it
should be renamed “Mothering burnout.” Finally, we determined
cut-off scores and examined the prevalence of parental burnout
in the general population.
GENERAL METHOD
Overview
The two studies reported here are part of the BParent research
program conducted at the Université catholique de Louvain in
Belgium which received the approval of the Ethics Committee
of the Psychological Sciences Research Institute. BParent is a
recent research program focusing on the nature, causes and
consequences of parental burnout. Participants in the two studies
were informed about this research program through social
networks, websites, schools, pediatricians or by word of mouth.
Inclusion criteria was to be parent and to have at least one
child still leaving at home. In order to avoid (self-)selection
bias, participants were not informed that the study was about
parental burnout. Study 1 was presented as a study about work-
family balance (this ensured that all participants were working
parents, which was important as we aimed to examine the
specificity of parental burnout vis-à-vis professional burnout).
Study 2 was presented as a study about “being a parent in
the twenty-first century” (we aimed to recruit a wider sample,
including unemployed parents). Parents could participate in the
studies only if they had (at least) one child still living at home.
Participants were invited to complete an online questionnaire
after giving informed consent. The informed consent signed by
the participants allowed them to withdraw at any stage without
having to give any justification. They were also assured that
data would remain anonymous. Participants who completed the
questionnaire had the opportunity to enter a lottery with a 1/1000
chance of winning e200. Participants who wished to participate
in the lottery had to provide their email address, but the latter was
disconnected from their questionnaire.
A potential measure of parental burnout was assessed in
both studies. A preliminary version of the Parental Burnout
Inventory (PBI) was created and used in Study 1. This version
was an adaptation of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI;
Maslach and Jackson, 1981), in which each of the 22 items of
the MBI was adapted to fit the parenting context. For example,
“I feel emotionally drained from my work” was changed into
“I feel emotionally drained from my parental role.” In Study
2, refinement of the PBI led us to reconsider items from the
depersonalization factor. Eleven new items presented in the Table
S2 were proposed relating to the concept of emotional distancing,
which appeared to be more suited to parental context than
depersonalization. The idea of replacing depersonalization with
emotional distancing emerged from the discussions of two 1-h
focus groups (n1 = 12, n2 = 8) that we set up with colleagues to
discuss the results of Study 1 (and in particular the poor validity
of the depersonalization component in the parental context).
Four questions had been prepared by the facilitators: (1) Do you
think that depersonalization exists in parental burnout? (2) If yes,
what are the core characteristics of depersonalization in parental
burnout? (3) If not, is there another specific mechanism in
parental burnout (try to name it)? (4) What are its characteristics?
Exactly the same idea (i.e., that depersonalization takes the form
of emotional distancing in the parental context) emerged from
the two focus groups. The 11 “emotional distancing” items were
then created and refined together with 8 colleague-parents who
participated in these groups. Parental burnout was therefore
reassessed in Study 2 using a set of 28 items, leading to a final 22-
item version assessing emotional exhaustion (8 items), emotional
distancing (8 items) and personal accomplishment (6 items). In
both studies, PBI items were rated on the same 7-point Likert
scale as in the original MBI: never (0), a few times a year or
less (1), once a month or less (2), a few times a month (3),
once a week (4), a few times a week (5), every day (6). Factor
and global scores were obtained by summing the appropriate
item scores, with higher scores indicating greater burnout; the
items of the personal accomplishment factor were therefore
reverse-scored.
Data Analyses
The questionnaire was completed online with the forced choice
option, ensuring a dataset without missing data. The validation of
the PBI was conducted according to the standards and guidelines
of the American Psychological Association (AERA et al., 2014).
In the current paper, we provide evidence to support the internal
structure of the PBI and its relations to other variables.
With regard to the internal structure of the PBI, principal
components analyses (PCAs), parallel analyses (Horn, 1965),
reliability estimates and assessment of normality were performed
in the two studies with Factor 10.2 software (Lorenzo-Seva and
Ferrandon, 2013) in order to test if the three-factor structure of

Parental Burnout Inventory
the MBI replicated in a parenting context. Only factor loadings
higher than 0.30 were interpreted. Parallel analyses based on 500
random permutations of the original data were used in order
to determine how many components to extract. These analyses
were based on a comparison between eigenvalues from a factor
analysis of the actual data and eigenvalues from a factor analysis
of a random dataset. The number of components to be retained
was based on the number of actual data eigenvalues higher than
the upper 95% confidence limit of random data eigenvalues
(Horn, 1965). Reliability was estimated with Cronbach’s alpha
coefficients (α). Assessment of normality was based on skewness
and kurtosis values. Values of asymmetry and kurtosis between
−2 and +2 were considered sufficient to prove normal univariate
distribution (George and Mallery, 2010). Confirmatory factor
analyses (CFAs) in Study 2 were computed using SEM software
AMOS 18.0 (Arbuckle, 1995, 2007). The measurement model
included the three latent variables representing the concepts
of emotional exhaustion, emotional distancing and personal
accomplishment, and their indicators consisting of 8 items for
emotional exhaustion, 8 for emotional distancing and 6 for
personal accomplishment. Analyses were conducted based on the
covariance matrix and using maximum likelihood estimation.
Several goodness-of-fit indices were used to determine the
acceptability of the models: χ2, the comparative fit index
(CFI) (Marsh et al., 1988) and the root mean-square error of
approximation (RMSEA) (Byrne, 2001). Chi-square compares
the observed variance-covariance matrix with the predicted
variance covariance matrix. It theoretically ranges from 0 (perfect
fit) to ∞ (poor fit). It is considered as satisfactory when it is non-
significant (Byrne, 2001). χ2/df is considered as satisfactory when
it is <2.5 in medium-sized samples (100 < N < 200) (Hu and
Bentler, 1999; Byrne, 2001). Note that the use of chi-square in
a large sample may be inadequate because excessive test power
(because of the large N) may prompt the rejection of acceptable
models (Hayduk, 1996). For CFI, values close to 0.90 or greater
are acceptable, while values higher than 0.95 indicate a good fit to
the data. RMSEA should preferably be less than or equal to 0.06,
but values under 0.08 are acceptable (Hu and Bentler, 1999).
With regard to the relations between the PBI and other
variables, the specificity of parental burnout vis-à-vis close
constructs was investigated by examining its correlations with
professional burnout and depression in Study 1, and parental
stress in Study 2. Also in Study 1, in order to test if the concept
of burnout was context-specific, both professional and parental
burnout items were subjected to a PCA, on the expectation that
six factors would be extracted with professional and parental
items loading on different dimensions. The relationship with
sociodemographic variables and criterion variables was also
examined but will be described elsewhere (in a paper on the
antecedents of parental burnout).

Measures
Socio-Demographics
Socio-demographics participants were asked about their age,
gender, number of children, nationality, marital status (single,
cohabitant, married, divorced, widowed), type of family (single
parent, living with the father/mother of the children, step-
family), level of education, and net monthly household
income.
Professional Burnout
Professional burnout was assessed with the Maslach Burnout
Inventory (MBI) (Maslach and Jackson, 1981). The MBI is a
widely used 22-item questionnaire encompassing three factors,
i.e., emotional exhaustion (9 items), depersonalization (5 items)
and personal accomplishment (8 items). Items are in the form
of “I feel emotionally drained from my work.” The instruction
is as follows: “Please read each statement carefully and decide
if you ever feel this way about your job.” Likert-type scales are
in the form of “How often,” with a 7-point scale of frequency,
i.e., never (0), a few times a year or less (1), once a month
or less (2), a few times a month (3), once a week (4), a few
times a week (5), every day (6).The global score is computed
after reversing the items of the personal accomplishment
factor, so that higher scores indicate greater burnout. The
Cronbach alphas reported in the MBI Manual are 0.90 for
emotional exhaustion, 0.79 for Depersonalization, and 0.71 for
Personal accomplishment (Maslach et al., 2010). The Cronbach
alphas found in the current sample were 0.90, 0.69, and 0.75,
respectively.

Parental Burnout Inventory
Parental Burnout
Parental burnout was measured using a version of the MBI
adapted to the parental context, as previously explained in the
Overview of the General Method.
Depression
Depression was assessed with the short form of the Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI). The BDI is a 13-item, self-report
questionnaire measuring symptoms of depression (Beck et al.,
1961). Items are scored on a scale from 0 to 3, e.g., 0: “I do not
feel sad,” 1: “I feel sad,” 2: “I am sad all the time and I can’t snap
out of it,” 3: “I am so sad and unhappy that I can’t stand it.”
The depression score is obtained by summing the 13 item scores.
Internal consistency for the BDI ranges from 0.73 to 0.92 with a
mean of 0.86 (Beck et al., 1988). The Cronbach alpha found in the
current sample was 0.86.
Results
Factor Structure and Reliability
Parallel analyses conducted on the 22 items supported a two-
factor structure when the means of random eigenvalues were
considered and a three-factor structure when 95th percentile
random data eigenvalues were considered. The first five
eigenvalues from the actual data were 7.65, 2.87, 1.32, 1.12, and
1.01; the corresponding first five means of random eigenvalues
were 1.45, 1.38, 1.32, 1.26, and 1.22; the corresponding 95th
percentile random data eigenvalues were 1.53, 1.44, 1.36, 1.30,
and 1.26.
Since the items were adapted from the three factors of the
MBI, three components were retained for the PCA of the 22
items. The three components explained 53.96% of the variance.
The loading parameter estimates for the three- components
solution as well as reliability estimates are presented in the
Table S1. All the items of the emotional exhaustion and
personal accomplishment scales had their primary loading on
the expected component with no cross-loading. However, for
depersonalization, only two items had their primary loading on
the expected component with no cross-loading (DP2 and DP3).
Two others had their primary loading on emotional exhaustion
component (DP1 and DP5), and the last did not load on any of
the three components (DP4). Fixing this problem was therefore
the main focus of Study 2. Skewness and kurtosis indicated that
three of the 22 items displayed deviations from normality. These
three items were the three depersonalization items that did not
load on the expected component or did not load on any of the
three components.
In order to investigate the relations between PBI and other
variables, scores were computed for the emotional exhaustion
and decreased personal accomplishment subscales, but not for
depersonalization, the validity of which was not supported by the
PCA. Scores were obtained by summing the item scores of the
two subscales (reverse-scored for personal accomplishment); the
higher the score, the greater the burnout. Descriptive statistics
of mean scores are presented in Table 2. Due to deviations from
normality, non-parametric correlations with both professional
burnout and depression were computed for the two validated
subscales only.

Relationships with Other Variables
Correlation coefficients between parental burnout, professional
burnout and depression are presented in Table 3. Low to
moderate coefficients suggest that as expected, significant
relations exist between parental burnout, professional burnout
and depression, but also that there is no complete overlap
between the concepts under consideration, i.e., parental burnout
is not just burnout and it is not just depression.
The PCA exploring components of both the 22 professional
and the 22 parental burnout items showed that, as expected,
the concept of burnout was context-specific, with professional
and parental items loading on separate components, i.e., three
for professional and three others for parental burnout. The
only exception was for “I feel I look after my children
impersonally, as if they are objects,” which loaded on professional
depersonalization. Parallel analyses conducted on the 44 items
suggested a five-factor structure when both the means of random
eigenvalues and the 95th percentile random data eigenvalues
were considered. The first six eigenvalues from the actual data
were 10.14, 4.62, 4.18, 1.98, 1.74, and 1.26; the corresponding
first six means of random eigenvalues were 1.75, 1.66, 1.60,
1.55, 1.50, and 1.46; the corresponding 95th percentile random

data eigenvalues were 1.83, 1.72, 1.65, 1.59, 1.54, and 1.50.
This was however due to the sixth component of parental
depersonalization which was found to be problematic.
STUDY 2
Sample
Data were collected from a sample of 1,723 parents. The
characteristics of the sample are presented in Table 1.
Measures
Socio-Demographics
Socio-demographics participants were asked about their age,
gender, number of children, nationality, marital status (single,
cohabitant, married, divorced, widowed), type of family (single
parent, living with the father/mother of the children, step-
family), level of education, and net monthly household income.
Parental Burnout
Parental burnout was measured using a revised 28-item version
of the questionnaire used in Study 1, as previously mentioned
in the Overview of the General Method. Following the results
of Study 1, the 9 items of the exhaustion scale and the 8 items
of the personal accomplishment scale were kept. All items of
the depersonalization scale were dropped and replaced by 11
new items created to reflect emotional distancing instead of
depersonalization.
Parental Stress
Parental
stress
was
assessed
with
the
Parental
Stress
Questionnaire (PSQ) (Vermulst et al., 2011). In its original
form, this 34-item questionnaire includes five factors, i.e.,
parent-child
relationship
problems,
parenting
problems,
depressive mood, parental role restriction, and physical health
problems. In order to limit the number of items in the online
survey and retain only items specific to parental stress, only
the scales “parent-child relationship problems,” “parenting
problems” and “parental role restriction” were included. Items
(e.g., “I feel happy with my child” or “Raising my child leaves me
with too little personal time”) were rated on a four-point Likert-
type scale from “not true” to “very true.” Scores were obtained
by averaging the item scores in each of the subscales, with higher
scores meaning higher parental stress. Cronbach alphas reported
for the original version of the PSQ scales ranged from 0.74
and 0.87 (Vermulst et al., 2015). Cronbach alphas found in the
current sample were 0.80, 0.72, and 0.86 for the three subscales,
respectively.
Data Analyses
For factor analysis purposes, the sample was split into two
subsamples of 862 and 861 participants, respectively. The 1,723
subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two subsamples.
The comparability of the two subsamples was checked with
crosstabs and χ2 analyses for categorical variables (e.g., parent
gender) and with oneway ANOVAs for continuous variables
(e.g., parent age). They were found to be strictly similar
with regard to socio-demographic characteristics. PCA was
computed on the first subsample and CFA was performed on
the second subsample. Analyses testing the relations between
parental burnout and other variables as well as examining the
prevalence of burnout were conducted on the entire sample
(N = 1,723).In the absence of a clinical sample of exhausted
parents (Schaufeli et al., 2001), prevalence was estimated three
times with three concurrent methods for comparison purposes.
First it was estimated based on the professional burnout cutoff
as recommended by Maslach et al. (2010). According to the
cutoffs provided for each MBI subscale by Maslach et al. (2010,
Appendix E, p. 48), people belong to the “low burnout” category
if their global MBI score is less than 30, to the “average burnout”
category if their MBI score is between 31 and 54, and to the “high
burnout” category if their global MBI score is greater than 55.
Second, it was estimated using a theoretical approach based on
the response scale. Parental burnout was rated with a 7-point,
Likert-type scale ranging from never (0) to every day (6). We
theoretically considered that parents had a high level of burnout
if they scored over 88, i.e., if they experienced each symptom/item
at least once a week. Third, prevalence was estimated with a
statistical cutoff usually used in clinical setting corresponding to
1.5 standard deviation over the mean of the sample (N = 1,723).
These estimations were also performed separately for mothers
and fathers in order to ensure that parental burnout concerned
fathers as well as mothers.
Results
Factor Structure and Reliability
Parallel analyses conducted on the 28 items suggested five-
factor structure when the means of random eigenvalues were
considered and a three-factor structure when 95th percentile
random data eigenvalues were considered. The first seven
eigenvalues from the actual data were 9.14, 4.34, 2.12, 1.47, 1.25,
1.11, and 1.08; the corresponding first seven means of random
eigenvalues were 1.34, 1.29, 1.26, 1.22, 1.20, 1.17, and 1.14; the
corresponding 95th percentile random data eigenvalues were
1.38, 1.33, 1.28, 1.25, 1.22, 1.19, and 1.17.
The
three-factor
structure
which
was
estimated
for
comparative
purposes
explained
55.76%
of
the
variance.
The loading parameter estimates for the three-factor solution
as well as the reliability estimates are presented in Table S2. All
the items of the emotional exhaustion scale had their primary
loading on the expected component, except for one item loading
on personal accomplishment. This item was dropped. All the
items of the personal accomplishment scale had their primary
loading on the expected component, with only one cross-loading
for one personal accomplishment item. However, one item was
dropped because it was not specifically related to parenting
(Pa7_ I feel full of energy). The other one was dropped because
its French wording, i.e., vivifié(e), was found to be difficult to
understand by low-educated participants (PA8_ I feel refreshed
when I have been close to my children). For emotional distancing,
over the 11 new items, eight had their primary loading on the
expected component with only one cross-loading. They were
kept for the final version.
Skewness and kurtosis indicated that seven of the 22 final
items displayed deviations from normality. Four of these items
were from the emotional distancing subscale and the three

 Roskam et al.
Parental Burnout Inventory
others from the personal accomplishment one. Conceptually,
these deviations from normality make sense: burnout is not
expected to be normally distributed in the population. Like
most mental health indicators, burnout is expected to present
an asymmetric distribution (i.e., to be positively skewed,
like most psychological disorders). However, as normality
is a critical assumption underlying the maximum likelihood
procedure used for CFA, log transformations of these items
were computed and ensured a normal distribution. Then
CFA was performed twice, once including transformed items
and the other including original items. Estimates and model
fit indices were strictly similar. Therefore, only the results
obtained from the analyses computed on original variables are
presented.
With regard to fit indices, χ2 was significant, χ2
(180) = 704.12,
p < 0.001, suggesting that a significant proportion of the
variance was unexplained by the model. However, this should not
necessarily lead to rejection of the model because of inadequate
use of χ2 in a large sample. Other fit measures demonstrated
a good fit to the data (CFI = 0.95, RMSEA = 0.06) with
all estimated factor loadings being significant at p < 0.001.
The completely standardized factor loadings ranged between
0.41 and 0.90. They are displayed in Table 4. Correlations
between the three factors were 0.48, 0.40, and 0.67. These results
provide strong support to the validity, i.e., internal structure, of
the PBI.
Relationships with Other Variables
In order to investigate the relations between PBI and other
variables, scores were computed for the three validated
PBI factors. These were obtained by summing the item
scores in each of the three subscales (items of the personal
accomplishment scale were reverse-scored); the higher the
scores, the higher the burnout. A global score was also
computed, which was found to be highly reliable (α = 0.91).
Descriptive statistics of the mean scores are presented in
Table 2.
Non-parametric
correlations
(due
to
deviations
from
normality) between the PBI and parental stress subscales are
presented in Table 3. Moderate coefficients suggest that, as
expected, significant relations exist between parental burnout
and parental stress, but also that there is not a complete
overlap between the two instruments and concepts they
measure. In other words, parental burnout is not just parenting
stress.
Prevalence of Burnout
Finally, prevalence was estimated in the sample of 1,723
participants. According to the cutoff points provided for job
burnout in the MBI manual (Maslach et al., 2010), 56.2%
of the parents (55.3% of the mothers, 62.5% of the fathers)
belonged to the “low burnout” category, 31.1% of the parents
(31.8% of the mothers, 25.9% of the fathers) to the “average
burnout” category and 12.7% of the parents (12.9% of the
mothers, 11.6% of the fathers) to the “high burnout” category.
According to the theoretical approach based on the response
scale, 1.3% of the parents (1.3% of the mothers, 1.3% of
the fathers) would be considered to be experiencing burnout
(i.e., experiencing each symptom/item at least once a week
= score over 88). Finally, according to a statistical cutoff
corresponding to 1.5 standard deviation over the mean of the
current sample, 8.8% of the parents (8.8% of the mothers,
8.5% of the fathers) would be considered to be experiencing
burnout.
DISCUSSION
Important sociological changes in recent decades have increased
pressure on parents to bring up healthy, secure and successful
children who will become well-rounded and engaged citizens.
Combined with a drastic decrease in stay-at-home mothers, these
changes have made parenting both increasingly demanding and
increasingly difficult. It is in this context that the concept of
parental burnout started to emerge. The aim of the current
research was to examine the construct validity of the concept
of parental burnout and to provide researchers with an
instrument to measure it. Throughout the two studies, we
accumulated evidence in favor of the existence of parental
burnout.

Parental Burnout Inventory
First, our study supported the three-dimensional structure
of burnout in the parental context. However, a crucial
step was overcome from Study 1 to Study 2 by replacing
depersonalization with emotional distancing. As in Pelsma’s
work (1989), depersonalization items adapted to parental context
from the professional burnout inventory did not work well in
Study 1. Actually, it is not surprising that depersonalization was
found to be unsuitable in the parental context. Although highly
exhausted employees may consider their clients or patients as
numbers, highly exhausted parents cannot “dehumanize” their
children. Even when they are at the end of their rope, parents
who do not suffer from psychosis or antisocial disorders cannot
consider the flesh of their flesh as objects. What they can do,
however, is distance themselves from the source of exhaustion.
In our clinical and research experience with parents of children
with externalized disorders, i.e., conduct disorder or antisocial
behavior, we have observed that exhausted parents disengage
emotionally rather than physically, i.e., they provide practical
care such as feeding or sleeping but became less emotionally
involved, sensitive and responsive to their offspring. This view
was empirically supported by both exploratory and confirmatory
factor analyses in Study 2. Thus, as in the professional context,
parental burnout takes the form of a tridimensional syndrome
encompassing emotional exhaustion, emotional distancing and
(low) personal accomplishment. The final version of the Parental
Burnout Inventory (PBI) consists of 22 items displaying strong
psychometric properties with good fit to the data and high
reliability estimates.
Second, our study suggests that parental burnout is, like job
burnout, a specific syndrome. The overlap with professional
burnout and depression was examined in Study 1, and
with parental stress in Study 2. For professional burnout,
coefficients ranged from −0.01 to 0.42. They were 0.41 and
0.48 for depression and ranged from 0.02 to 0.62 for parental
stress subscales. These low to moderate correlations suggest
that, as expected, significant relations exist between parental
burnout, professional burnout, parental stress and depression,
but also that parental burnout is not just burnout, stress
or depression. The independence between professional and
parental burnout was also supported by the PCA including
both MBI and PBI items, meaning that being exhausted at
work does not imply being exhausted at home. For many
workers incurring burnout, family life may be seen as a safe
haven and for many parents incurring burnout, work seems
to be a safe place. This study therefore confirms that burnout
is a context-specific rather than a context-free syndrome.
Second, our study supports that the burnout syndrome in
the parental context is not exclusive to mothers. Although
the vast majority of our participants were women—which
suggests that women may still be more involved in parenting
than fathers—the study confirms that burnout concerns fathers
as well. Fathers who put an effort into their fathering (i.e.,
they were interested in their work-family balance—Study 1—
and in being a parent—Study 2) had the same probability of
burnout as mothers. Hence, irrespective of the cutoff points
used, the prevalence of parental burnout was the same among
mothers and fathers. This suggests that the name “parental
burnout” is more appropriate than “maternal burnout,” especially
as fathers are becoming increasingly involved in parenting.
The prevalence of parental burnout confirms Procaccini and
Kiefaber’s intuition that some parents are so exhausted that the
term “burnout” is appropriate (Procaccini and Kiefaver, 1983).
The proportion of burnout parents lies in the current study
somewhere between 2 and 12% (depending on the cut-off points
applied).
LIMITATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
While innovative and promising, the current study is by no mean
definitive. Several limitations have to be mentioned that lead to
recommendations for future research.
First, Pelsma (1989) had suggested that the MBI may be a
good starting point to build a measure of parental burnout.
And we documented how fundamental transformations in the
workplace mirrored in the parental context a few decades
later. However, there may be some disadvantages of starting
from an existent scale to make it stick to another concept.
Another way to proceed would have been to start from
parental experience as did Maslach and Freudenberger for the
MBI. In this respect, the construct validity of the PBI would
gain from a mix-method approach including qualitative data
collection. The percentage of variance explained of 55.76%
reported in study 2 may be improved by a refinement of
the construct validity of the PBI through a mix-method
approach.
Second, our results are compatible with the view of Hakanen
et al. (2008) and Iacovides et al. (2003) that (parental) burnout
may be situated on a continuum between stress and depression.
But the cross-sectional design of the two studies does not
permit to confirm this view. On the one hand, correlations
found with parental stress are coherent with the common view
that burnout occurs when high stress has been experienced
for too long. On the other hand, correlations found with
depression could mean that experiencing burnout may lead
to abundant and long-term stress hormone secretion resulting
in a depressive syndrome. Longitudinal studies of (sub)clinical
samples investigating the developmental course of parental stress
turning into parental burnout and depression are nevertheless
needed to confirm this.
Third, none of the three methods employed in this study to
estimate prevalence is fully satisfying. The first method, based
on Maslach’s cutoffs, implies that the professional and parental
contexts share the same exhaustion boundaries. The limited
overlap between parental and professional burnout suggests that
this is not the case. Moreover, people can probably “bear” more
in the parental context before feeling exhausted than in the
professional context. The second method, based on response-
scales, relies on our clinical experience from parental counseling
that exhausted parents experience burnout symptoms/items at
least once a week. However, social desirability may lead parents
to under-report the frequency with which they experience the
various symptoms/items in the questionnaire, which would make

 Roskam et al.
Parental Burnout Inventory
the cut-off point of 88 irrelevant. Finally, the third method,
based on a statistical cutoff, is not entirely satisfying either.
Although it is mainly used in psychometric approaches to IQ
tests, for example, it is far less relevant in case of non-normally
distributed data. Studies on incoming patients consulting for
parental exhaustion are therefore urgently needed to establish
clinically-relevant cutoffs, i.e., associated with actual differences
in functioning. However, since parental burnout is a very recent
concern in the European countries (see the discussion of socio-
cultural changes in the introduction section), parental burnout is
just emerging as a reason for referral. Several months (or years in
the US) would probably be needed to gather participants referred
for severe parental exhaustion. Future studies are needed to refine
these estimations based on clinically-derived cutoffs.
Fourth, percentage of mothers and fathers belonging to high
burnout category irrespective of the cutoffs used, was found to
be similar. However, we did not test the measurement invariance
across genders in order to ensure that the same construct was
assessed in mothers and fathers. We could not test as we had
only 224 men in the study. Future studies should replicate
our preliminary results and test measurement invariance across
gender. They should also take into account possible confounding
variables. Indeed, statistical models as one-way MANCOVA may
be used to assess differences among the frequency to which
parental burnout are displayed by mothers and fathers when
other variables are controlled for. In particular, age or personality
traits as neuroticism should be taken into account. The same
models may be implied to parents having chronically ill or
disabled child and parents having healthy children, as well as to
parents having infants or preschoolers and parents with older
children. The differences among the frequency to which parental
burnout is displayed in subgroups has to be investigated to
document that parental burnout is a problem of general interest
and not a problem specific to some subgroups of parents only.
Finally, considering the consequences parental burnout may
have for the individual, the couple, and the child(ren), studies
addressing this syndrome are urgently needed. As well as the
consequences, the causes also need to be examined, in order to
understand the developmental processes that underlie parental
burnout and define intervention strategies. Although the causes
and consequences of parental burnout lay outside the scope of the
current study, we will now put forward a few hypotheses about
causes and consequences at the micro-, meso- and macro-levels
that should be tested in future research.
As a main causal mechanism, any sociodemographic, family
or personal characteristics that increase the imbalance of
demands over resources should increase vulnerability to parental
burnout. The limited overlap found in the current study between
professional and parental burnout suggests that they probably
share common causes but also rely on specific ones. At the
micro-level, common causes may be a personality that scores
highly for neuroticism, leading to the risk of burnout in several
demanding settings, in particular family and work; specific
causes for parental burnout may be personal history and its
resulting ideal parental self (which may be unrealistic). At the
meso-level, a common cause may be lack of support; while
specific causes may for example lie in the number of children
to care for, young, disabled or ill children, low household
income, or inadequate parenting practices. At the macro-level,
common causes may be conflicting values between the self-
sacrifice of work or parenting and time for oneself. Specific
causes may be laws and advertising that increase pressure on
parents.
Regarding the consequences, positioning burnout on a
continuum between parental stress and depression (Iacovides
et al., 2003; Hakanen et al., 2008) suggests that depression may
be a frequent consequence at the micro-system level. Other likely
consequences include the risk of addiction and deteriorating
health, as previously demonstrated for job burnout (Ahola et al.,
2006; Melamed et al., 2006). Consequences of these at the
macro-system level would be a significant increase in health
care costs. At the meso-level, parental disengagement and low
accomplishment may lead to a reduction of responsiveness
(Bornstein, 1989), which is known to be related to poor parent-
child relationships and insecure attachment (van Ijzendoorn,
1995), harsh, neglecting parenting or maltreatment (Aber and
Allen, 1987; Wiggins et al., 2015). Because of the potentially
dramatic and long-lasting consequences that parental burnout
may have for children, parental burnout’s prospective effect
on child development as well as behavioral issues should
be a top priority in the research agenda. As well as the
child, parental burnout certainly impacts the partner, who
has to compensate for his/her coparent’s withdrawal from
family life and/or neglectful behavior toward offspring. A
negative effect of parental burnout on conjugal conflict and
coparenting is also expected. Finally, our experience with
children suffering from externalized disorders suggests that
parental burnout may also increase the risk of separation and
divorce.
The foregoing research is necessary to build a comprehensive
model of parental burnout, including both its underlying
mechanisms and prospective effect at all levels. This model
would offer insight into therapeutic solutions, the relevance
and efficiency of which in reducing parental burnout should
finally be tested with an evidence-based approach. Systematic
comparisons of effect sizes resulting from interventions focusing
on the macro-, meso- and micro-level mechanisms are needed.
They should inform researchers and clinicians about the best
ways to decrease the impact of risk factors or to increase
the effect of protective ones, as well as to limit the harmful
consequences for the parent him/herself, the coparent and their
children. As this paper suggests, there are many interesting
and socially relevant research directions in the field of parental
burnout, as much as there were in the field of job burnout
40 years ago. We hope that the present contribution, in
particular the development and validation of an instrument
to measure parental burnout, will stimulate research in this
area.
