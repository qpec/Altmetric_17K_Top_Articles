Abstract
Background: Canadians’ health care-seeking behaviour for physical and mental health issues was examined using
the international Quality and Cost of Primary Care (QUALICOPC) survey that was conducted in 2013 in Canada.
Method: This study used the cross-sectional Patient Experiences Survey collected from 7260 patients in 759 practices
across 10 Canadian provinces as part of the QUALICOPC study. A Responsive Care Scale (RCS) was constructed to
reflect the degree of health care-seeking behaviour across 11 health conditions. Using several patient characteristics as
independent variables, four multiple regression analyses were conducted.
Results: Patients’ self-reports indicated that there were gender differences in health care-seeking behaviour, with
women reporting they visited their primary care provider to a greater extent than did men for both physical and
mental health concerns. Overall, patients were less likely to seek care for mental health concerns in comparison
to physical health concerns. For both women and men, the results of the regressions indicated that age, illness
prevention, trust in physicians and chronic conditions were important factors when explaining health care-seeking
behaviours for mental health concerns.
Conclusion: This study confirms the gender differences in health care-seeking behaviour advances previous
research by exploring in detail the variables predicting differences in health care-seeking behaviour for men and
women. The variables were better predictors of health care-seeking behaviour in response to mental health concerns
than physical health concerns, likely reflecting greater variation among those seeking mental health care. This study
has implications for those working to improve barriers to health care access by identifying those more likely to engage
in health care-seeking behaviours and the variables predicting health care-seeking. Consequently, those who are not
accessing primary care can be targeted and policies can be developed and put in place to promote their health
care-seeking behavior.
Keywords: Health care-seeking behaviour, Primary care, Gender
Background
In Canada primary care services provided by physicians
are free (paid for through taxation and fees) to all citi-
zens [1]. Except for a few population-based screening
programs for certain diseases, patients have to actively
seek out primary care services in the community.
Primary care can be roughly divided into physical health
care, which refers to managing acute or chronic illness
and the overall function of the body, and mental health
care, which refers to managing conditions such as de-
pression, anxiety and bipolar disorder. Physical and
mental health conditions are not mutually exclusive, and
there are “multiple associations between mental health
and [chronic] physical conditions…” [2]. Due to the
structure of the health care system in Canada, patients
seeking physical and mental health care usually present
initially to the primary care provider [3].

 Health care-seeking behaviour, also called health- or
help-seeking behaviour interchangeably in the literature,
is a complex concept. Cornally et al. [4] use the term
help-seeking behavior and defines it as “a problem fo-
cused, planned behaviour, involving interpersonal inter-
action with a selected health-care professional” when
seeking help for a health problem. A decade-old report
[5] describes two theoretical approaches: the utilization
of the formal system or “end point” which is described
as health care seeking behavior, and the process concept
that includes illness response or health seeking behavior.
For the purpose of this paper we will use the term
“health care-seeking behavior”.
The literature indicates that patients seek health care
more often in response to physical health concerns than
for mental health concerns [6]. However, women seek
more health care in response to both physical and men-
tal health concerns [7–12]. Even when accounting for in-
creased health care needs unique to women (e.g.,
pregnancy and related care), research has demonstrated
that women visit family physicians more often and re-
port longer consultation times than men [11, 13].
Health care-seeking behavior is influenced by many
patient characteristics such as by socio-economic status,
gender and age [5]. Other issues such as knowledge of
illness prevention and health maintenance, trust in phy-
sicians and the presence of chronic conditions have also
been demonstrated to impact health care-seeking behav-
ior, including frequency and length of visits, satisfaction
and willingness to seek care [10, 11, 14–22]. Adults over
65 years tend to have more consultations with family
physicians than younger adults [10, 11, 14]. Older pa-
tients also report more positive health care-seeking atti-
tudes regarding mental health concerns than younger
patients [7, 23].
Patients with greater health care needs, such as those
with chronic conditions and multiple health concerns,
use health care to a greater extent than patients with
lesser need, and this utilization increases with the num-
ber of chronic conditions the patient has [11, 21, 22]. Fi-
nally, greater trust in physicians is related to better
health outcomes and increased patient satisfaction [16,
19]. In this paper we will examine the predictive utility
of a number of factors (gender, age, illness prevention,
health maintenance, trust in physicians, chronic condi-
tions) that impact variations in patients’ health care-
seeking behaviours for both physical and mental health
concerns.
The current study
The primary objective of the current study is to expand
our understanding of health care-seeking behaviour in pri-
mary care with regard to mental health concerns. As pre-
vious research indicates that gender plays a significant
role in patient response to physical health concerns, we
expected it also is relevant for mental health concerns.
This research was guided by two research questions:
1) Are there gender differences in the extent to which
patients seek health care in response to physical and
mental health concerns? 2) What patient characteristics
predict the extent to which women and men seek help
in response to physical and mental health concerns?
Methods
The QUALICOPC project is an international study in-
vestigating the quality, cost and equity of primary care
in countries around the world [24]. Detailed information
on the recruitment and administration of the QUALI-
COPC surveys in Canada can be found elsewhere (see
Wong, et al. [25]). Briefly, the project utilized four sur-
veys to examine primary care in Canada; one survey was
completed by the physician, one was completed by either
the physician or practice staff, and two were completed
by patients of the practice. The survey of interest for this
study was the Patient Experiences Survey (PES) that was
completed by patients waiting in primary care provider’s
waiting room. Physicians in all 10 Canadian provinces
were invited to participate in the Canadian QUALI-
COPC study [25]. Physicians who agreed to participate
were responsible for distributing the PES to their pa-
tients, and were compensated with $200 for their efforts;
the participating patients were strictly volunteers. The
surveys were consistently administered by provincial re-
search teams in each province. Ethics approval was ob-
tained from the research ethics boards at each provincial
lead investigator’s institution (see Table 1). For this paper
we only used data from the Canadian PES, which con-
sisted of 51 items assessing demographic details and in-
formation about participants’ health and experiences
with primary care in Canada [24].
Measures
Based on the PES survey data, we created a Responsive
Care Scale, and used single-item questions to assess gen-
der, age, illness prevention, health maintenance, level of
trust in physicians, and presence of chronic conditions.
Responsive Care Scale (RCS)
An 11-item scale was constructed from the sub-items of
one survey question (PES Q25) that measured whether
participants would visit a family doctor in response to a
variety of health concerns. Subsequently, two subscales
were constructed from those 11 scale items, separately
grouping physical health concerns (6 items; RCS-P) and
mental health concerns (5 items; RCS-M). The scale
items are presented in Table 1. Items were measured on
a 4-point scale (1 = No; 2 = Probably not; 3 = Probably
yes;
4 = Yes),

indicating

 inclination to visit a family doctor. There was also a “Don’t
know” response option; all of these responses were
recoded as missing data. For this study, the overall RCS as
well as the two subscales (RCS-P and RCS-M) demon-
strated adequate internal consistency (α = .84 for the RCS,
α = .71 for the RCS-P, and α = .81 for the RCS-M).
Illness prevention
Participants’ confidence in their own ability to prevent
illness was assessed using a single question: “How well
do you know how to prevent problems with your
health?” (PES Q33). Responses were measured on a 5-
point scale from 1 (Hardly confident at all) to 5 (Com-
pletely), with higher scores indicating greater confidence
in their knowledge. There was also an “I don’t have any
health problems” response option; all of these responses
were recoded as missing data.
Health maintenance
Participants’ confidence in their ability to maintain their
health was assessed using a single question: “How
confident are you that you can maintain the changes in
your health habits, like diet and exercise, even during
times of stress?” (PES Q34). Responses were measured
on a 5-point scale from 1 (Hardly confident at all) to 5
(Totally confident), with higher scores indicating greater
confidence in their ability.
Trust in physicians
Participants’ level of trust in physicians was assessed
using a single item: “In general, doctors can be trusted.”
(PES Q28-1). Responses were measured on a 4-point
scale from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 4 (Strongly agree),
with higher scores indicating greater levels of trust.
Chronic conditions
A single dichotomous (yes/no) question assessed whether
participants’ had a chronic condition: “Do you have a
longstanding disease or condition such as high blood
pressure, diabetes, depression, asthma or another long-
standing condition?” (PES Q2).
Analytical strategy
The existence of gender differences in health care-
seeking behaviours is well-documented in the literature
[5, 7–13]. Therefore, after analyzing the descriptive sta-
tistics of the sample, a 2 x 2 mixed-design ANOVA was
conducted to investigate gender differences in the extent
of participants’ health care-seeking behaviours specific-
ally for physical and mental health concerns. Then, a
total of four multiple linear regression analyses were
conducted, run separately for men and women to iden-
tify what patient characteristics were associated with
health care-seeking behaviours for physical and mental
health concerns. The dependent variables for the regres-
sions were scores on the RCS-P and RCS-M; the inde-
pendent variables were age, illness prevention, health
maintenance, trust in physicians and chronic conditions.
We used an alpha level of .05 for all statistical tests; a
Bonferroni correction was applied for the four regres-
sions to avoid inflation of Type I error, setting the sig-
nificance level at .0125 (p = .05/4). All analyses were
conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 21 [26].
Results
Sample characteristics
The final sample comprised 7260 patients (4697 women,
2425 men, 138 did not answer) from 759 practices, ran-
ging in age from 19 to 100 years (M = 53.33, SD = 16.50).
Participants were predominantly Canadian-born (83.9 %)
and were fluent in French or English (80.2 %). Most had
at least one other adult living in their household
(75.8 %) and had no children under the age of 18 living
in their household (70.5 %). Overall, participants were
well-educated, with more than half having completed
post-secondary education (58.2 %), and were employed/
self-employed (55.1 %) or retired (29.1 %). Most partici-
pants were visiting the doctor by appointment (92.3 %),

for

reasons
(71.2 %). The most commonly endorsed reasons for the
visits were routine medical checks (27.0 %), follow-up
appointments (26.5 %), renewing a prescription (22.2 %),
and because they were ill or did not feel well (20.4 %).
On average, participants reported moderate health
care-seeking-behaviour in response to health concerns
(mean [M] = 2.90, standard deviation [SD] = 0.66). Of
the health concerns presented, patients reported the
greatest health care-seeking behaviour for blood in the
stool (M = 3.66, SD = 0.74), and the least for relationship
problems (M = 2.13, SD = 1.10). This pattern is the same
for both genders. Means and standard deviations for all
RCS items are presented in Table 2.
Gender differences in the extent of patients’ health
care-seeking behaviour
A 2 (gender) by 2 (type of health concern) mixed-design
ANOVA was conducted to compare the extent of
women’s and men’s health care-seeking behaviours in re-
sponse to physical and mental health concerns. Results
revealed a significant between-subject main effect of
gender, F(1, 6939) = 140.63, p < .001, η2 = .02. Examin-
ation of the means and standard deviations indicated
that women (M = 2.94, standard error [SE] = 0.01) re-
ported they would visit their primary care physician in
response to health concerns to a greater extent than did
men (M = 2.74; SE = 0.01). The ANOVA also produced a
significant within-subject main effect of type of health
concern, F(1, 6939) = 1226.51, p < .001, η2 = .15. The de-
scriptive information indicated that patients reported
they would visit a family doctor for physical health
concerns (M = 3.01, SE = 0.08) to a greater extent than
for mental health concerns (M = 2.67, SE = 0.01). How-
ever, both of these main effects were qualified by a sig-
nificant interaction effect between gender and the type
of health concern, F(1, 6939) = 61.44, p < .001, η2 = .01.
Although univariate follow-up tests suggested that the
gender difference for both types of health concerns was
significant,

[t(6950) = −12.43, p < .001, d = −0.31] was greater than
for the RCS-P [t(6950) = −7.35, p < .001, d = −0.18].
Patient characteristics predicting the extent of health
care-seeking behaviour
Because of the gender differences in health care-seeking
behaviour, four multiple linear regressions were con-
ducted to examine the predictive utility of age, illness
prevention, health maintenance, trust in physicians and
chronic conditions separately for women and men. How-
ever, a Bonferroni adjustment was used for these ana-
lyses to avoid inflation of Type I error; thus, the
significance value was set at .0125 (p = .05/4). All data
was screened according to procedures outlined by
Tabachnick and Fidel [27]; all univariate and multivariate
regression assumptions were met. In Table 3, we present
descriptive information for the independent variables
that were used in the regression analyses.
The first multiple regression predicted women’s scores
on the RCS-M (presented in Table 3). As expected, age,
illness prevention, trust in physicians and chronic condi-
tions significantly predicted the extent to which women
would visit their primary care physician in response to
mental health concerns, F(5, 4306) = 23.63, p < .001, with

Women who were younger, had greater confidence in
their ability to prevent illness, had greater trust in physi-
cians, and had chronic conditions reported that they
would visit their primary care physician for mental
health concerns to a greater extent than women who
were older, had less confidence in their ability to prevent
illness, had lower trust in physicians, and no chronic
conditions.
The second multiple regression predicted women’s
scores on the RCS-P (presented in Table 3). Only trust
in physicians significantly predicted the extent to which
women would visit their primary care physician in re-
sponse to physical health concerns, F(5, 4349) = 10.15, p
< .001, with the whole model accounting for 1.0 % of the
variance. Women who had greater trust in physicians re-
ported that they would visit their primary care physician
for physical health concerns to a greater extent than
women who had lower trust in physicians.
The third multiple regression predicted men’s scores
on the RCS-M (presented in Table 3). As expected, age,
illness prevention, trust in physicians and chronic condi-
tions significantly predicted the extent to which men
would visit their primary care physician in response to
mental health conditions, F(5, 2185) = 16.106, p < .001,
with the whole model accounting for 3.6 % of the vari-
ance. Men who were younger, had greater confidence in
their ability to prevent illness, greater trust in physicians
and chronic conditions reported that they would visit
their primary care physician for mental health concerns
to a greater extent than men who were older, had less
confidence in their ability to prevent illness, lower trust
in physicians and no chronic conditions.
The fourth multiple regression predicted men’s scores
on the RCS-P (presented in Table 4). None of the factors
significantly predicted the extent to which men would
visit their primary care physician in response to physical
health concerns, F(5, 2201) = 2.387, p = .036.
Discussion
This study examined the characteristics of patients visit-
ing primary care providers in response to a variety of
health concerns. It specifically investigated the extent of
women’s and men’s health care-seeking behaviours in re-
sponse to mental and physical health concerns.
Several of the findings confirm what is already known
in the literature, such as patients being more inclined to
visit their primary care providers in response to physical
health concerns than mental health concerns [6]. In
addition, we found that women reported that they would
visit a family physician in response to both physical and
mental health concerns to a greater extent than did
men, which is also consistent with other studies [7–12].
Additional examination of facilitators and barriers influ-
encing women’s and men’s health care-seeking behav-
iours could inform health care initiatives addressing
patients’ access to and utilization of primary care.
As expected, we found that age, knowledge of illness
prevention, trust in physicians and having chronic con-
ditions significantly predicted health care-seeking behav-
iour in response to mental health concerns, and this was
the case for women and for men. These findings are
consistent with previous research [10, 11, 14, 19–22].
However, a new and somewhat surprising finding was
that younger patients (women and men) were more will-
ing to seek primary care in response to mental health
concerns compared to older patients. This is an encour-
aging development and we speculate that a number of

 reasons may be responsible for this shift in health care-
seeking behavior. Currently a lot of public health mes-
sages, often spearheaded by celebrity Canadians, convey
the message that many Canadians suffer from a mental
illness and that one should seek help and not be
ashamed. In addition, people speak more freely about
their struggles with mental health, either in the popular
media or via social media and therefore, we speculate,
that the stigma around health care seeking behavior for
mental health is dismissing.
Most of our variables did not predict health care-
seeking behaviour in response to physical health con-
cerns. The sole exception was the finding that women
with greater trust in physicians were more inclined to
seek health care in response to physical health concerns.
Of particular interest is the fact that, contrary to previ-
ous research [7, 10, 11, 28], older age did not predict
health care-seeking behaviour in response to physical
health concerns. Moreover, none of our variables pre-
dicted men’s health-care seeking behaviour in response
to physical health concerns. It may be that most people
would seek health care in response to the particular set
of physical health concerns presented in the survey. Fi-
nally, knowledge of health maintenance did not predict
health care-seeking behaviour for physical or mental
health concerns, despite previous research suggesting
that increased self-efficacy, in particular for patients with
chronic conditions, is associated with improved health
outcomes [17].
Although many of our findings were significant due to
the large sample, in general the effect sizes were small.
Consequently, some of the results may not have mean-
ingful real world implications. Caution must be taken in
drawing conclusions until future studies either support
or refute them. Nevertheless, we do think that there are
clinically significant issues that can be gleaned from the
data. First, men are underrepresented in the group of pa-
tients seeking primary care in response to both physical
and mental health concerns. This has been extensively
reported in other literature [7–12], and still remains a
concern. Second, it may be suggested that primary care
providers should focus on increasing health literacy re-
garding illness prevention among their patients, so that
patients then will be able to better assess when they
should seek primary care.
Limitations and future directions
In the survey, patients were asked to indicate whether
they would visit a family doctor for a selection of health
concerns. The list of health concerns presented was not
exhaustive, but instead covered a range of potential
health concerns. We subdivided these concerns into two
subscales measuring the extent to which they would seek
primary care for physical health concerns and for mental
health concerns. As these scales were created from the
available survey items, they were not externally pub-
lished or validated, and studies examining other health
concerns may find different results and therefore may
be limited in its application. Patients were recruited in
family physicians’ offices, therefore orphaned patients’
views are not represented in this sample; hence, our
sample is not fully representative of the general Canad-
ian population. In addition, we did not ask patients
about their sexual orientation. Research suggests that
members of the LGBT community often feel less satis-
fied with primary care than members of non-LGBT
communities [12]. Further, we lacked adequate data re-
garding participants’ cultural background, education
and income, which may also be notable determinants of
health care-seeking behaviour [10, 11, 20, 22]. The
strength of the study was that the sample was large,
representing all 10 Canadian provinces. Thus the trend
that younger people are more comfortable seeking care
from primary care providers for mental health issues is
a robust one.
Conclusion
Health care-seeking behavior is influenced by different
personal characteristics, such as gender, age, knowledge
of illness prevention, trust in physicians and having
chronic conditions. Men are still underrepresented in
primary care; it is difficult to understand why, and this is
an ongoing issue. The most important finding—that
younger patients, both men and women, are more will-
ing to seek primary care in response to mental health
concerns compared to older patients—is encouraging in
that it allows problems to be identified and addressed
earlier in primary care.
