BACKGROUND
We tested erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcito-
nin gene–related peptide receptor, for the prevention of episodic migraine.
METHODS
We randomly assigned patients to receive a subcutaneous injection of either erenumab, 
at a dose of 70 mg or 140 mg, or placebo monthly for 6 months. The primary end 
point was the change from baseline to months 4 through 6 in the mean number 
of migraine days per month. Secondary end points were a 50% or greater reduction 
in mean migraine days per month, change in the number of days of use of acute 
migraine–specific medication, and change in scores on the physical-impairment and 
everyday-activities domains of the Migraine Physical Function Impact Diary (scale 
transformed to 0 to 100, with higher scores representing greater migraine burden 
on functioning).
RESULTS
A total of 955 patients underwent randomization: 317 were assigned to the 70-mg 
erenumab group, 319 to the 140-mg erenumab group, and 319 to the placebo group. 
The mean number of migraine days per month at baseline was 8.3 in the overall 
population; by months 4 through 6, the number of days was reduced by 3.2 in the 
70-mg erenumab group and by 3.7 in the 140-mg erenumab group, as compared with 
1.8 days in the placebo group (P<0.001 for each dose vs. placebo). A 50% or greater 
reduction in the mean number of migraine days per month was achieved for 43.3% 
of patients in the 70-mg erenumab group and 50.0% of patients in the 140-mg 
erenumab group, as compared with 26.6% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for each 
dose vs. placebo), and the number of days of use of acute migraine–specific medica-
tion was reduced by 1.1 days in the 70-mg erenumab group and by 1.6 days in the 
140-mg erenumab group, as compared with 0.2 days in the placebo group (P<0.001 
for each dose vs. placebo). Physical-impairment scores improved by 4.2 and 4.8 points 
in the 70-mg and 140-mg erenumab groups, respectively, as compared with 2.4 points 
in the placebo group (P<0.001 for each dose vs. placebo), and everyday-activities scores 
improved by 5.5 and 5.9 points in the 70-mg and 140-mg erenumab groups, respec-
tively, as compared with 3.3 points in the placebo group (P<0.001 for each dose vs. 
placebo). The rates of adverse events were similar between erenumab and placebo.
CONCLUSIONS
Erenumab administered subcutaneously at a monthly dose of 70 mg or 140 mg sig-
nificantly reduced migraine frequency, the effects of migraines on daily activities, 
and the use of acute migraine–specific medication over a period of 6 months. The 
long-term safety and durability of the effect of erenumab require further study.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
M
igraine can be broadly classified 
as either episodic or chronic on the ba-
sis of the number of migraine days and 
headache days per month.1 Episodic migraine is 
defined as fewer than 15 migraine days or head-
ache days per month, with or without aura, and 
accounts for more than 90% of persons with 
migraine,2 whereas chronic migraine, defined as 
at least 15 headache days per month (of which 
≥8 are migraine days with or without aura), af-
fects approximately 5% to 8% of persons with 
migraine.3
Acute migraine–specific medications, such as 
the serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor ago-
nists (triptans),4 are used to abort a migraine at-
tack, whereas preventive treatments aim to reduce 
the frequency and severity of migraine.5 Patients 
who have sufficient migraine attacks to be disabled 
by the condition are candidates for preventive 
therapy.6 Commonly used migraine-preventive 
therapies, such as topiramate, propranolol, and 
amitriptyline, may not be entirely effective5 or may 
have unacceptable side effects, leading to poor 
adherence.7 The currently used preventive medi-
cations were developed for other indications rather 
than for a target that is part of the specific patho-
physiological processes involved in migraine.8
Calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) is in-
volved in the pathophysiological mechanisms un-
derlying migraine through nociceptive mecha-
nisms in the trigeminovascular system.9-12 The 
role of CGRP in migraine was shown in phase 2 
and phase 3 clinical trials of small-molecule 
CGRP-receptor antagonists13-18 in acute migraine 
and is further supported by phase 2 and phase 3 
trials of monoclonal antibodies targeting the 
CGRP pathway,19-22 which suggests that the path-
way could be a target for preventive migraine 
treatment. Erenumab is a fully human monoclonal 
antibody that selectively and potently binds to 
the canonical CGRP receptor.23 In phase 2 trials, 
erenumab was found to significantly reduce the 
number of migraine days per month in patients 
with episodic migraine at a monthly dose of 
70 mg22 and in patients with chronic migraine at 
doses of 70 mg and 140 mg in the last month of 
a 3-month double-blind treatment phase.24 Here 
we report the results of STRIVE (Study to Evalu-
ate the Efficacy and Safety of Erenumab in Mi-
graine Prevention), a phase 3 trial of erenumab 
at doses of 70 mg and 140 mg in patients with 
episodic migraine.
Methods
Trial Population
Adults 18 to 65 years of age who had had a his-
tory of migraine with or without aura for at least 
12 months before screening were eligible for par-
ticipation in the trial. Migraine was defined in 
accordance with the International Classification 
of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (beta version).1 
Patients had to have at least 4 and fewer than 
15 migraine days per month and fewer than 15 
headache days per month on average during the 
3-month period before screening (as reported by 
the patients) and during a 4-week baseline phase 
that was assessed with the use of a handheld elec-
tronic diary (ERT) completed daily by the patient 
and had to demonstrate at least 80% adherence 
to reporting with the electronic diary during the 
baseline phase. Patients were excluded if they 
were older than 50 years of age at migraine onset, 
had a history of hemiplegic migraine or cluster 
headache, had received botulinum toxin within 
4 months before or during the baseline phase, 
used devices or procedures for migraine preven-
tion within 2 months before the baseline phase, 
or had had no therapeutic response to more than 
two migraine-preventive treatment categories (ad-
ditional inclusion and exclusion criteria are pro-
vided in the Supplementary Appendix, available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). 
The original protocol did not permit inclusion of 
patients who were receiving migraine-preventive 
medication; in order to evaluate the effect of eren-
umab in a broader patient population, a protocol 
amendment that was implemented during the en-
rollment period allowed the enrollment of patients 
with concomitant use of one migraine-preventive 
medication taken at a stable dose (i.e., with no 
changes to the dose within 2 months before the 
baseline phase or at any time during the trial) 
(see the Supplementary Appendix).
Trial Oversight
The trial protocol was approved by the indepen-
dent ethics committee at each trial center and is 
available at NEJM.org. Patients provided written 
informed consent. Amgen and Novartis, the code-
velopers of erenumab, funded this trial. Amgen 
provided the trial drug and conducted the data 
analyses. A medical writer, funded by Amgen, 
wrote the first draft of the manuscript under the 
direction of the authors. All the authors interpret-

ed the data, contributed to the preparation of the 
manuscript, made the final decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication, and attest to the accu-
racy and completeness of the data and adverse-
events reporting and to the fidelity of the trial to 
the protocol.
Trial Design
This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3 trial 
conducted at 121 sites across North America, Eu-
rope, and Turkey from July 2015 (when the first 
patients underwent randomization) until Sep-
tember 5, 2016 (primary completion date). The 
trial had four phases: screening (≤3 weeks of 
initial screening and a 4-week baseline phase); 
the double-blind treatment phase (24 weeks); the 
active-treatment phase, in which patients under-
went repeat randomization and were assigned to 
receive 70 mg or 140 mg of erenumab (28 weeks); 
and a safety follow-up phase (12 weeks). The re-
sults from the baseline and double-blind treatment 
phases are reported here. Results from the active-
treatment and safety follow-up phases have not 
yet been analyzed. Safety follow-up data for pa-
tients who did not enter the active-treatment 
phase are included in this report.
At the end of the 4-week baseline phase, eli-
gible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 
ratio to receive monthly subcutaneous injections 
of 70 mg of erenumab, 140 mg of erenumab, or 
placebo at day 1 and weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20, 
administered by trained staff at the trial sites. 
Randomization was based on a schedule that had 
been generated by the sponsor before initiation 
of the trial and was centrally executed with the use 
of an interactive voice or Web response system. 
Randomization was stratified according to region 
(North America vs. other) and according to the 
use of migraine-preventive medication (current 
use, previous use only, or no previous or current 
use). The patients, site personnel, and trial-spon-
sor personnel were not aware of the trial-group 
assignments.
Trial Assessments and Safety Evaluations
During the baseline and double-blind treatment 
phases, patients completed an electronic diary 
daily with information about their migraine and 
nonmigraine headaches, including the date and 
time of onset and resolution, pain severity and fea-
tures, associated symptoms, and the use of mi-
graine-specific abortive therapies and analgesic 
medications. Patients also completed the Mi-
graine Physical Function Impact Diary (MPFID), a 
13-item self-administered instrument measuring 
physical functioning in the past 24 hours, on 
migraine and nonmigraine days using the elec-
tronic diary. The MPFID contains a 7-item every-
day-activities domain (MPFID-EA; scores range 
from 7 to 35, with higher scores indicating greater 
interference of migraine with everyday activity) and 
a 5-item physical-impairment domain (MPFID-PI; 
scores range from 5 to 25, with higher scores indi-
cating greater physical impairment due to mi-
graine), as well as a global question to assess the 
overall effect of migraines. For the analysis, these 
scores were averaged over a period of 1 month 
and then linearly transformed to a 100-point scale. 
Safety was monitored throughout the trial through 
reporting of adverse events and serious adverse 
events with the use of definitions from the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 19.0. The 
safety assessment included evaluation of labora-
tory values, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and 
anti-erenumab antibodies (additional information 
about the safety assessments is provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
End Points
The primary objective of the trial was to com-
pare erenumab with placebo with regard to the 
primary end point of the change in mean num-
ber of migraine days per month from baseline to 
the final 3 months (months 4 through 6) of the 
double-blind treatment phase. A migraine day was 
defined as any calendar day on which the patient 
had onset, continuation, or recurrence of a quali-
fied migraine as recorded in the electronic diary. 
A qualified migraine was defined as a migraine 
(with or without aura) lasting at least 30 minutes 
and manifesting with at least two pain features, 
at least one associated nonpain feature, or both 
(information on migraine features is provided in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Any calendar day 
on which acute migraine–specific medication was 
used was counted as a migraine day. The first-tier 
secondary end points were at least a 50% reduction 
from baseline in the mean number of migraine 
days per month and the change from baseline in 
the mean number of days of use of acute mi-
graine–specific medication (including triptans or 
ergotamine derivatives) per month, and the sec-
ond-tier secondary end points were the change

missing data. Sensitivity analyses were conducted 
with multiple imputation under missing-at-random 
and missing-not-at-random assumptions. For the 
secondary end point of a 50% or greater reduction 
in mean migraine days per month, a stratified 
Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test was used after 
imputation of missing data as nonresponse. Sen-
sitivity analyses for this end point included a gen-
eralized linear mixed-effects model without any 
imputation of missing data. Further information 
on the sensitivity analyses is provided in the Sup-
plementary Appendix. The significance of the 
between-group differences with regard to the pri-
mary and secondary end points was determined 
after multiplicity adjustment with a prespecified 
hierarchical gatekeeping procedure and Hoch-
berg-based testing procedures to maintain the 
two-sided, study-wise, type I error rate at an alpha 
level of 0.05. The primary end point was tested 
separately for each erenumab dose at an alpha 
level of 0.04 for 70 mg and of 0.01 for 140 mg. 
First-tier and second-tier secondary end points 
were then tested sequentially with the use of the 
procedure detailed in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.
The full analysis set in the final protocol in-
cluded all the patients who underwent random-
ization. The efficacy end points are reported with 
the use of the following efficacy analysis set: pa-
tients who received at least one dose of erenumab 
or placebo and had at least one postbaseline mea-
surement for migraine days per month during 
the double-blind treatment phase, analyzed ac-
cording to randomly assigned trial regimen. The 
efficacy analysis set meets the criteria for a full 
analysis set.25 The safety analysis set included all 
the patients who underwent randomization and 
received at least one dose of erenumab or placebo, 
analyzed according to randomly assigned trial 
regimen unless the dose received throughout the 
double-blind treatment phase differed from the 
one that had been randomly assigned.

Results
Patients
A total of 955 patients underwent randomization 
(317 to the 70-mg erenumab group, 319 to the 
140-mg erenumab group, and 319 to the placebo 
group), and 858 patients (89.8%) completed the 
6-month double-blind treatment phase (Fig. S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The groups 
were balanced with respect to demographic and 
clinical characteristics (Table 1, and Table S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). The mean age of 
the patients was 40.9 years, 405 (42.4%) were cur-
rently using or had previously used migraine-pre-
ventive medication, and 370 (38.7%) had discon-
tinued their use of a previous preventive medication 
because of insufficient efficacy or unacceptable 
side effects, as documented in patient records or 
reported by the patient. During the baseline phase, 
all three trial groups had a mean of 8.3 migraine 
days per month, 562 patients (58.8%) used acute 
migraine–specific medications, and 27 patients 
(2.8%) used one migraine-preventive medication.
End Points
From baseline to the final 3 months of the 
double-blind treatment phase, the reduction in 
mean migraine days per month was 3.2 days in 
the 70-mg erenumab group and 3.7 days in the 
140-mg erenumab group, as compared with 1.8 
days in the placebo group (P<0.001 for each dose 
vs. placebo) (Table 2 and Fig. 1). Erenumab at 
either dose was superior to placebo with regard 
to all secondary end points over the final 3 months 
of the double-blind treatment phase. At least a 50% 
reduction in mean migraine days per month from 
baseline to months 4 through 6 was achieved for 
43.3% of patients in the 70-mg erenumab group 
and 50.0% of patients in the 140-mg erenumab 
group, as compared with 26.6% in the placebo 
group (P<0.001 for each dose vs. placebo). The 
odds of having at least a 50% reduction in mean 
migraine days at months 4 through 6 were 2.1 
and 2.8 times greater for the 70-mg and 140-mg 
groups, respectively, than for the placebo group 
(P<0.001 for both comparisons) (Table 2 and 
Fig. 2). From baseline to the final 3 months of the 
Figure 1. Primary End Point.
Least-squares mean changes from baseline in migraine days per month during the double-blind treatment phase 
are shown. The I bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Changes from baseline in mean migraine days over the 
final 3 months (months 4, 5, and 6) in both erenumab dose groups differed significantly from those in the placebo 
group (P<0.001 for each comparison). Data were analyzed with the use of a repeated-measures, linear mixed-effects 
model including trial group, baseline value, stratification factors, scheduled visit, and the interaction of trial group 
with scheduled visit, and the analysis was based on the data as observed with no imputation of missing values. Pa-
tients were given erenumab or placebo at day 1 (baseline) and at months 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The figure is based on the 
efficacy analysis set (patients who received at least one dose of erenumab or placebo and had at least one post-
baseline measurement for migraine days per month during the double-blind treatment phase).

Controlled Trial of Erenumab for Episodic Migraine
double-blind treatment phase, the mean number 
of days of use of acute migraine–specific medi-
cation per month was reduced by 1.1 days in the 
70-mg erenumab group and by 1.6 days in the 140-
mg erenumab group, as compared with 0.2 days 
for the placebo group (P<0.001 for each dose vs. 
placebo) (Table 2, and Fig. S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
The effect of migraine on patient-reported 
physical functioning was determined with the use 
of the MPFID. Transformed MPFID-EA scores (on 
a scale of 0 to 100, with higher values represent-
ing greater interference of migraine with every-
day activity) were reduced from baseline by 5.5 in 
the 70-mg erenumab group and by 5.9 in the 
140-mg erenumab group, as compared with 3.3 in 
the placebo group (P<0.001 for each dose vs. 
placebo) (Table 2, and Fig. S3 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Transformed MPFID-PI scores 
(on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher values repre-
senting greater physical impairment due to mi-
graine) were reduced by 4.2 in the 70-mg erenu-
mab group and by 4.8 in the 140-mg erenumab 
group, as compared with 2.4 in the placebo group 
(P<0.001 for each dose vs. placebo) (Table 2, and 
Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
 
Safety
A total of 572 (90.4%) of the 633 patients who 
received at least one dose of erenumab and 278 
(87.1%) of the 319 patients who received at least 
one dose of placebo received all six planned dos-
es. The frequency and severity of adverse events, 
serious adverse events, and adverse events lead-
ing to discontinuation of the trial regimen were 
similar between the erenumab groups and the 
placebo group (Table 3, and Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Numerically more in-
stances of injection-site pain occurred in the 70-mg 
erenumab group than in the placebo group. A 
total of 35 of the 628 patients (5.6%) for whom 
postbaseline antibody data were available tested 
positive for anti-erenumab binding antibodies 
(8.0% of patients in the 70-mg group and 3.2% 
of patients in the 140-mg group), one of whom, 
in the 70-mg erenumab group, tested positive for 
neutralizing antibodies (0.2%). No clinically mean-
ingful differences between the erenumab groups

The percentage of patients with a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in mean migraine days per month over 
the final 3 months (months 4, 5, and 6) in both erenumab dose groups differed significantly from that in the place-

test after imputation of missing data as nonresponse. Patients were given erenumab or placebo at day 1 (baseline) 
and at months 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The figure is based on the efficacy analysis set (patients who received at least one 
dose of erenumab or placebo and had at least one postbaseline measurement for mean migraine days per month 
during the double-blind treatment phase).

Discussion
Migraine-preventive treatment with subcutaneous 
erenumab, a monoclonal antibody to the canoni-
cal CGRP receptor, at a monthly dose of 70 mg 
or 140 mg resulted in a mean reduction in the 
frequency of migraine days that was significantly 
greater (by almost 2 days) than that associated 
with placebo. As compared with placebo, erenu-
mab treatment also resulted in greater reductions 
from baseline in the use of acute migraine–spe-
cific medications and in the effect of migraine 
on functioning in adults with episodic migraine.
Typically, a clinical response to migraine ther-
apy has been defined as at least a 50% reduction 
in mean migraine days per month.26 The rate of 
a 50% or greater reduction in mean migraine 
days in the 140-mg erenumab group was 50.0%, 
as compared with 26.6% in the placebo group. 
The clinical benefit of erenumab was corrobo-
rated by significantly greater reductions in the 
number of days per month that acute migraine–
specific medications were used in each of the 
erenumab dose groups, as compared with the 
placebo group. This trial also assessed the effect 
of migraine on patients’ lives after treatment with 
erenumab. The observed reductions in physical-
impairment and daily-activity scores associated 
with each dose of erenumab versus placebo sug-

Controlled Trial of Erenumab for Episodic Migraine
gest that the reduction in migraine frequency 
translated into a reduction in the effect of migraine 
on patients. The treatment response achieved with 
erenumab was apparent from the first efficacy 
time point at month 1, which suggests that pa-
tients had an early benefit (Table S2 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix).
During the 6-month double-blind treatment 
phase of this trial, no cardiovascular safety sig-
nal was observed, and the overall safety profile 
of erenumab was similar to that of placebo. A 
total of 90.4% of the patients who received eren-
umab and 87.1% of the patients who received 
placebo received all planned doses. Fewer than 
3% of patients withdrew from the trial because 
of adverse events, a rate numerically lower than 
the rates reported for oral migraine-preventive 
treatments in studies of similar duration, although 
a direct comparison with these agents was not 
made in this trial.27
A limitation of this trial was the exclusion of 
patients who had had no therapeutic response to 
more than two classes of migraine-preventive 
drugs (see the Supplementary Appendix for defi-
nitions). However, patients could be included in 
the trial if they had discontinued previous mi-
graine-preventive treatment because of insufficient 
efficacy, a lack of sustained response, or unac-
ceptable side effects, and erenumab was found to 
have efficacy, despite the fact that 38.7% of the 
patients had previously not had a beneficial effect 
from migraine-preventive drugs. Efficacy was sim-
ilarly demonstrated in a phase 2 trial of erenumab 
involving patients with chronic migraine, in which 
68% of patients had previously discontinued mi-
graine-preventive medication because of a lack of 
efficacy or unacceptable side effects.24
The double-blind treatment phase of this trial, 
conducted over a period of 6 months in patients 
with episodic migraine, together with other phase 
2 and 3 trials of erenumab for the treatment of 
episodic and chronic migraine,22,24,28 suggest that 
erenumab may be useful for the prevention of 
episodic migraine. Further trials are needed to 
determine the long-term safety of erenumab and 
the durability of its effects.
