Abstract
Patient-reported experience is a critical part of measuring health care quality. There are limited 
data on racial differences in patient experience. Using patient-level data for 2009–10 from the 
Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS), we compared 
blacks’ and whites’ responses on measures of overall hospital rating, communication, clinical 
processes, and hospital environment. In unadjusted results, there were no substantive differences 
between blacks’ and whites’ ratings of hospitals. Blacks were less likely to recommend hospitals 
but reported more positive experiences, compared to whites. Higher educational attainment and 
self-reported worse health status were associated with more negative evaluations in both races. 
Additionally, blacks rated minority-serving hospitals worse than other hospitals on all HCAHPS 
measures. Taken together, there were surprisingly few meaningful differences in patient experience 
between blacks and whites across US hospitals. Although blacks tend to receive care at worse-
performing hospitals, compared to whites, within any given hospital black patients tend to report 
better experience than whites do.
Patient-reported experience in health care is widely recognized as an important quality 
metric.1 Payers and policy makers are increasingly using this metric to hold hospitals 
accountable, and performance on patient-reported experience measures has received 
widespread attention.2 One area of particular concern is racial disparities in patients’ 
experiences. Previous studies have shown that patients who report poor experiences with 
health systems are more likely to delay further care and are at higher risk of nonadherence to 
treatment recommendations, compared to patients who report better experiences.3–6 These 
patterns of delay and non-adherence are more commonly seen among minority patients than 
among white patients.7–10 Therefore, understanding how patient experience varies between 
minority and white patients is particularly salient.
In this study we focused on the experience of care for black patients compared to that of 
white patients (for information related to Hispanics, see online Appendix Exhibit A1).11

 There are reasons to be concerned that black patients may have worse experiences with 
health care than whites. Because of various historical events, black patients have lower levels 
of trust in the health care system and physicians, which may contribute to their 
experience.12,13 It is possible that because of such factors as lack of cultural competency, 
some health care providers may be less effective at communicating with black patients or 
addressing their needs than they are with white patients. Previous work has shown that 
distrust of the health care system is associated with lower rates of recommended disease 
prevention and treatment of acute and chronic illness, as well as worse health status.13 It is 
critically important to understand both the extent to which black patients may have 
differences in experience with hospital care and how those differences might be addressed.
Care for black patients is highly concentrated: About 10 percent of US hospitals care for 
nearly half of all black patients.14 A previous study found that the top 10 percent of hospitals 
by proportion of black patients admitted during 2009–10— which we call minority-serving 
hospitals—are more likely than other hospitals to report providing cultural competency 
training.15 Furthermore, hospitals with higher cultural competency scores have better 
Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) scores 
both overall and specifically for minority patients, compared to other hospitals.16 In turn, 
hospitals with higher HCAHPS scores do better on measures of clinical performance, 
compared to other hospitals.17
In addition, hospitals in communities with higher proportions of minority residents employ a 
higher fraction of clinical providers who are minorities themselves, compared to other 
hospitals.18,19 Research has shown that when minority patients are cared for by minority 
providers, the patients are more likely to rate their care highly than when minority patients 
are cared by nonminority providers.18,20 Taken together, these previous findings led us to 
hypothesize that racial disparities in patient experience would be smaller in hospitals that 
serve a disproportionately high number of black patients than in other hospitals.
Although there is robust evidence of racial differences in care patterns and outcomes, less is 
known about racial differences in patient experience.21,22 Mark Haviland and colleagues 
found that blacks gave a mix of higher and lower ratings on measures of satisfaction 
regarding their individual health plans, compared to whites.22 Elizabeth Goldstein and 
coauthors found that for a group of hospitals that voluntarily chose to report data, there were 
very few differences in patient experience between blacks and whites.21 However, neither 
study directly examined care delivered at minority-serving hospitals. Our study examined 
patient experience across all US hospitals, avoiding potential bias from over-or 
underreporting by different types of hospitals, and it included hospitals with large 
concentrations of black patients.
In this study we sought to answer three questions. First, do blacks have worse patient 
experience in US hospitals compared to whites? Second, if gaps in patient experience do 
exist, to what extent do they vary according to patients’ level of education or self-reported 
health status? Previous work has shown that these factors affect patients’ outcomes and 
experiences.23,24 Finally, are differences in experiences between black and white patients 
predominantly seen within the same hospitals, or are they driven primarily by site of care?

 We hypothesized that black patients’ experiences of care would be better at hospitals that 
served large numbers of black patients than at hospitals that served mostly white patients— 
and, thus, that differences in patient experience between blacks and whites would be smaller 
at hospitals that served large numbers of black patients.
Study Data And Methods
DATA
We used patient-level data obtained from the 2009 and 2010 HCAHPS surveys of hospitals. 
Hospitals are required to report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 
data on measures including those of inpatient experience. The HCAHPS survey was 
developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and is administered by 
hospitals to a random sample of adult patients from forty-eight hours to six weeks after 
discharge.
The survey reports the following two global measures of a patient’s overall experience: an 
overall rating of the hospital on a scale from 0 to 10, and whether or not the patient would 
recommend the hospital. The survey also reports six composite measures: communication 
with physicians, communication with nurses, communication about medications, pain 
control, discharge process, and staff responsiveness. The methodology used by CMS to 
calculate composite scores has been described previously.25
In addition, the survey reports two patient measures of aspects of the hospital environment: 
cleanliness and quietness. The survey also contains self-reported information on the patient’s 
age, sex, race, health status, primary language spoken at home, reason for admission, and 
level of education. In this study we included only patients who identified themselves as 
black or white. We excluded Hispanic patients (including those who reported themselves as 
Hispanic black or Hispanic white) and patients from other minority groups (for information 
related to other minority groups, see Appendix Exhibit A1).11
Because of CMS regulations, patient-level data are available to researchers only in ways that 
make it statistically impossible to identify individual hospitals. Therefore, we could obtain 
data on only the following three variables to characterize the hospitals where patients 
received their care: each hospital’s proportion of inpatient admissions who were black 
Medicare patients, hospital size (small, or fewer than 100 beds; medium, or 100–399 beds; 
or large, or 400 beds or more—the size ranges used by the American Hospital Association), 
and whether or not the hospital was a major teaching hospital (defined as being a member of 
the Council of Teaching Hospitals of the Association of American Medical Colleges).
We classified the 10 percent of hospitals with the highest proportion of black patients 
admitted as minority-serving hospitals and the other 90 percent of hospitals as non-minority-
serving hospitals. Our data were obtained from the Iowa Quality Improvement Organization, 
and linkage of the American Hospital Association survey data to HCAHPS data was 
conducted by MassPRO.

 OUTCOMES
Our primary outcomes were the following two global measures of a patient’s experience: the 
overall rating of the hospital on a scale from 0 to 10, and whether the patient would 
recommend the hospital. Our secondary outcomes were the eight other measures described 
above (the six composite measures and the two patient measures of the hospital 
environment). Each primary and secondary outcome was dichotomized as follows: a rating 
of 9 or 10 versus a rating of 8 or below for hospital rating; a rating of “definitely yes” versus 
“definitely no,” “probably no,” and “probably yes” for recommendation; “yes” versus “no” 
for the discharge domain; and “always” versus “never,” “sometimes,” and “usually” for the 
remaining measures. For example, with regard to communication with doctors, patients were 
asked, “How often did the doctors treat you with courtesy and respect?” A composite score 
was then created, as described by CMS.25
ANALYSIS
We used chi-square tests to compare the characteristics of black and white patients and those 
of the two types of hospitals. We also used chi-square tests to compare racial differences in 
patient experience for the primary and secondary outcomes.
Next, we built multivariable logistic regression models, using generalized estimating 
equations to account for clustering at the hospital level. To capture overall differences 
between black and white patients, we used an independent correlation structure. To account 
for within-hospital correlation, we used an empirical correlation matrix. These models 
adjusted for baseline differences in self-reported age, sex, health status, education, primary 
language spoken at home, and reason for admission.
To identify within-hospital racial differences, we then built a multilevel logistic regression 
model using hospital random effects. Finally, we reran models that used generalized 
estimating equations and that were stratified by education, health status, and type of hospital 
(minority-serving or other). The analyses within subgroups were preceded by tests for effect 
modification using interaction terms between race and each of the three stratification factors.
Analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4. The study was approved by the Harvard T. 
H. Chan School of Public Health Institutional Review Board’s Committee on the Use of 
Human Subjects.
LIMITATIONS
Our study had several limitations. First, we used HCAHPS measures, which on average had 
only a 30 percent response rate. However, extensive testing of the measures suggests that the 
results are not substantially affected by nonresponse bias, especially when factors such as 
response mode are taken into account. In fact, CMS has enough confidence in these 
measures to include scores on them in its Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program.
Second, HCAHPS measures are inherently subjective. We were therefore unable to 
distinguish between differences in behavior of physicians and nurses within hospitals and 
differences in patients’ expectations.26 However, one could argue that providers’ behavior 
and patients’ expectations are not easily separable, given that the former can shape the latter.

 In any case, it is critically important to examine patient experience despite unmeasurable 
factors such as underlying expectations.
Finally, our data reflected care before the start of Hospital VBP Program and therefore did 
not reflect changes that might have resulted from the program. It is possible that trends in 
patient experience may have changed since the program’s introduction. However, we think 
any substantial differences are unlikely, since national HCAHPS scores have risen only 
slightly over the past few years, and there is little evidence that they would have risen more 
for one racial group than for another.27
Study Results
PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS
We had data on 4,365,175 respondents who completed the HCAHPS survey during 2009–10 
(Exhibit 1). Black respondents made up 9.8 percent of the sample, and white respondents the 
remaining 90.2 percent. Compared to white patients, black patients were more likely to be 
younger than age sixty-five, to be female, to report their health status as fair or poor, and to 
have been admitted for a medical reason, and were less likely to have graduated from high 
school.
HOSPITAL CHARACTERISTICS
Of the 3,796 hospitals included in our study, 364 hospitals (9.6 percent) were designated as 
minority-serving hospitals based on their proportion of black patients (Appendix Exhibit 
A2).11 These hospitals were more likely than the remaining hospitals to be large (36.1 
percent versus 23.4 percent; p < 0.001) and to be teaching hospitals (34.8 percent versus 
13.3 percent; p < 0.001). Unsurprisingly, the proportion of black patients in minority-serving 
hospitals was much higher than in other hospitals (41.2 percent versus 6.4 percent; p < 
0.001).
PATIENT SATISFACTION BY RACE
We examined the unadjusted and adjusted relationship between patient experience, which 
included two global measures of satisfaction and eight secondary domains of clinical care, 
and race (for adjusted results, see Exhibit 2; for unadjusted results, see Appendix Exhibit 
A3).11 In unadjusted results, there was no significant difference between blacks and whites 
in rating hospitals best (66.5 percent versus 65.9 percent; p = 0.37), but blacks were less 
likely than whites to recommend hospitals (68.1 percent versus 70.6 percent; p < 0.001) (see 
Appendix Exhibit A4).11 On the other measures, blacks reported more positive experiences 
than whites for seven of eight measures (Exhibit 3).
In models adjusted by patient characteristics, results were similar except that blacks were 
slightly more likely than whites to rate hospitals best (66.9 percent versus 65.9 percent; p < 
0.001) (see Appendix Exhibit A4).11
EFFECT OF EDUCATION—We stratified our results by education and health status. In 
both unadjusted (data not shown) and adjusted models (Exhibit 4), patients of both races

 with at least some college were less likely to recommend hospitals or give them the highest 
rating, compared to patients with less education. For both blacks and whites, higher 
educational attainment was also associated with more negative evaluations of 
communication measures, staff responsiveness, and both hospital environment measures 
(Exhibit 4). These stratified results were significant for all measures of patient experience. 
Moreover, adjusted differences in experience between blacks and whites were narrower 
among patients with at least some college for all measures except that related to the 
discharge process, compared to patients with less education.
EFFECT OF HEALTH STATUS—When we examined the effect of health status, patients 
who reported having either poor or fair health scored lower on all measures of patient 
experience, compared to patients who reported having good or excellent health, in both 
unadjusted (data not shown) and adjusted models (Appendix Exhibit A6).11 The patterns of 
differences between blacks and whites with different health statuses were consistent with the 
overall differences we found, with blacks reporting more positive experiences than whites 
across all ten measures.
PATIENT SATISFACTION BY SITE OF CARE
In our within-hospital analyses, which controlled for the influence of individual hospitals on 
the patient experience measures, blacks were slightly more likely than whites to recommend 
hospitals (69.7 percent versus 68.2 percent; p < 0.001) (see Appendix Exhibit A4).11 This 
was different from what we found in our unadjusted models and in our models that were 
adjusted by patient mix and survey mode only. In addition, the gap between blacks’ and 
whites’ experiences was wider in our within-hospital analyses than in the unadjusted models 
for the hospital rating and for seven of the eight secondary measures (Exhibit 3). Blacks 
were generally more positive in the within-hospital analyses than in the overall ones, except 
for satisfaction with the discharge process (see Appendix Exhibit A4).11
We subtracted the within-hospital differences from the overall differences to obtain the 
between-hospital components of difference. These estimated components reflect the 
differences in hospital scores attributable to the influence of hospitals on patient experience
—which, in turn, reflects the differences in the average patient experience between minority-
serving hospitals and other hospitals. The between-hospital components of difference 
between blacks and whites were −2.7 percent for recommendation of hospitals and −2.8 
percent for ratings of hospitals (Exhibit 3). For all eight secondary domains, the components 
were also negative. The negative signs suggest that black patients get care at hospitals 
where, on average, the experience of care is worse for all patients.
We compared patient experience in minority-serving hospitals versus that in other hospitals, 
given that care of black patients is highly concentrated in a few hospitals. Overall, patients 
were less likely to recommend minority-serving hospitals than other hospitals (67.2 percent 
versus 71.7 percent; p < 0.001) and less likely to give minority-serving hospitals a high 
rating, compared to other hospitals (64.5 percent versus 67.2 percent; p < 0.001) (Appendix 
Exhibit A5).11

 When we stratified our results by race, we found that, compared to whites, blacks were more 
likely to recommend other hospitals (73.1 percent versus 71.6 percent; p < 0.001) and less 
likely to recommend minority-serving hospitals (66.1 percent versus 68.0 percent; p < 
0.005) (Appendix Exhibit A7).11 Similarly, black respondents were more likely than whites 
to rate other hospitals as best (71.1 percent versus 67.0 percent; p < 0.001). There was no 
significant difference in the rating of minority-serving hospitals between the two races (65.2 
percent for blacks versus 64.2 percent for whites; p = 0.10). A formal test of interaction 
between race and site of care was significant for both overall hospital rating and 
recommendation of hospital (p < 0.001 for both).
Discussion
In our national sample of US hospitals, we found surprisingly few meaningful differences in 
patient experience between black and white patients. Blacks generally reported more 
positive experiences than whites did. Even in the area of communication, where concerns 
about cultural competence may be heightened, we found that black patients generally 
reported more positive experiences with both physicians and nurses than white patients did. 
However, the gap between races in patient experience was smaller among patients with at 
least some college than among those with less education.
We also found that while all patients gave minority-serving hospitals worse scores than other 
hospitals, black patients seemed to rate them no more highly than white patients did. In fact, 
black patients reported a better experience in other hospitals than in minority-serving 
hospitals across the board. Taken together, these findings offer some reassurance about the 
experiences of black patients compared to those of white patients in US hospitals. However, 
they also raise important concerns that black patients’ care is concentrated in hospitals that 
perform poorly on patient experience for all patients.
Our findings of racial differences by patients’ characteristics and sites of care have important 
implications for the health outcomes of minority patients. Our results indicate that minority 
patients, on average, receive care at hospitals that perform significantly worse than others on 
measures of patient satisfaction. Previous studies have shown that hospitals with the highest 
HCAHPS scores perform higher on quality measures of clinical processes, compared to 
hospitals with the lowest HCAHPS scores.17 Given that minority patients are already at 
higher risk of nonadherence to treatment recommendations and are more likely to experience 
delays in care, compared to white patients, the fact that minority patients are receiving care 
at minority-serving hospitals that perform worse on all measures of satisfaction raises 
particular concerns.
Our study confirms our hypothesis that site of care may be an important component of 
patient experience for blacks—but in a direction opposite to what we predicted. We tested 
the hypothesis that a high concentration of black patients in a given hospital would improve 
that hospital’s ability to provide a better experience for blacks, compared to hospitals with 
low concentrations of black patients. However, we found that minority-serving hospitals 
actually perform worse than other hospitals on patient experience of care for both blacks and 
whites.

 Since the 2003 Institute of Medicine report Unequal Treatment highlighted racial disparities 
in care,28 increasing attention has been paid to the notion of cultural competency training to 
improve care delivered to minority patients. Previous work has shown that hospitals that 
deliver more culturally competent care have higher overall HCAHPS scores and also do 
particularly well with minority patients.16 Our findings suggest that enough effective 
cultural competency training may not be occurring in minority-serving hospitals, possibly 
because these institutions have fewer resources than other hospitals or focus on different 
priority areas. Policy efforts and interventions aimed at improving patient experience for 
minority patients may be more effective if they target minority-serving hospitals in 
particular, instead of trying to increase cultural competency training across all hospitals.
We observed a consistent pattern of blacks reporting more positive experiences than whites 
in terms of most measures of care. This finding may reflect racial differences in treatment, 
expectations, or both. For example, our results suggest that black and white patients may 
have different expectations for quietness in the hospital, given that whites were less satisfied 
than blacks with the level of quietness, and it is unlikely that black patients would be 
systematically allocated to quieter hospital rooms across the country, compared to whites. It 
is less clear what explains small differences in global rating measures (overall hospital 
ratings and likeliness to recommend the hospital).
Our findings of a narrower gap in patient experience between blacks and whites with higher 
educational attainment than between those with less education may also reflect differences 
in underlying expectations. Higher educational attainment correlates closely with higher 
socioeconomic status and greater financial security. Thus, compared to less educated 
patients, more educated patients may have higher expectations for health and a greater 
demand for a certain level of care, which translates to lower evaluations of hospital 
experience.29–31
We are unaware of any previous study that examined racial differences in patient experience 
across a nationally representative group of US hospitals. Goldstein and colleagues evaluated 
a subset of hospitals that voluntarily reported patient experience scores and found results 
somewhat similar to ours.21 Previous work has shown that physician groups that choose to 
voluntarily report data are different from those that choose not to, with higher performers 
more likely than lower performers to volunteer.32 Thus, examining all hospitals that are 
required to respond provides a more comprehensive and valid assessment of patient 
experience for blacks and whites in US hospitals.
Other studies focusing on commercial and Medicaid health plans have found that minorities 
tend to rate their plans lower than do whites.30 However, these gaps are largely due to 
within-plan instead of between-plan differences. Our findings are consistent with a broader 
set of studies suggesting that differences in care patterns between white and black patients 
are often driven more by where people receive care (that is, black patients’ 
disproportionately receiving care at hospitals with poor quality compared to hospitals with 
low concentrations of minority patients) than by being treated differently within the same 
institution, although this varies by condition and metric examined.14,33 For example, Tom 
Figueroa et al.

 LaVeist and colleagues found that health disparities are mitigated when patients receive care 
under similar conditions.34
Our work thus has important policy implications. First, minority-serving hospitals may be 
different from other hospitals—more lacking in resources or technical skills needed to 
provide patient-centered care. Therefore, efforts aimed at improving the experience of black 
patients needs to focus on minority-serving hospitals and to do so in ways that are likely to 
be effective in the institutions’ specific context. For example, identifying minority-serving 
hospitals that are particularly effective at delivering patient-centered care and then 
disseminating their practices may be a more effective approach to improving care at other 
similar hospitals than focusing on a broader set of high-performing institutions, most of 
which are likely to care for few minority patients. CMS has a series of programs focused on 
helping hospitals improve, though we are unaware of any program that specifically targets 
minority-serving institutions.
Finally, given that we know black patients have higher hospital readmission rates than 
whites,35 an area of concern is the small but consistent racial difference in receipt of 
adequate hospital discharge information. These findings may suggest one reason why gaps 
in readmission rates exist between blacks and whites. Both minority-serving and other 
hospitals appear to do a worse job ensuring effective discharge planning for black patients 
than for white patients. It may be that hospitals and policy makers need to make additional 
efforts in this area to ensure that all patients receive effective discharge planning and care 
coordination, particularly patients whose experience in this area has been suboptimal.
Conclusion
We found that across US hospitals, blacks reported comparable or even better patient 
experience than whites. These differences vary somewhat by educational status, with wider 
racial gaps among patients with lower levels of educational attainment than those with more 
education. Finally, while minority-serving hospitals tend to have lower levels of performance 
with all of their patients, we found no evidence that they were particularly adept at 
maximizing patient experience for blacks. These results suggest that policies and strategic 
efforts related to patient experience should focus on targeting the small number of hospitals 
that disproportionately care for black patients and on trying to improve their performance 
with all patients. ▪

 Exhibit 2. Differences between black and white hospital patients in patient experience, adjusted 
by patients’ characteristics, 2009–10
SOURCE Authors’ analysis of data for 2009–10 from the Hospital Consumer Assessment 
of Health-care Providers and Systems. NOTES Multivariable regression models were used 
to adjust for differences between black and white satisfaction scores in self-reported age, 
sex, health status, education, primary language spoken at home, and reason for admission. 
Differences for all measures were significant (p < 0.01) except for cleanliness (p = 0.798).
