Rationale: Umbilical cord–derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) are easily accessible and expanded in 
vitro, possess distinct properties, and improve myocardial remodeling and function in experimental models of 
cardiovascular disease. Although bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells have been previously assessed 
for their therapeutic potential in individuals with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, no clinical trial has 
evaluated intravenous infusion of UC-MSCs in these patients.
Objective: Evaluate the safety and efficacy of the intravenous infusion of UC-MSC in patients with chronic stable 
heart failure and reduced ejection fraction.
Methods and Results: Patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction  under optimal medical treatment 
were randomized to intravenous infusion of allogenic UC-MSCs (Cellistem, Cells for Cells S.A., Santiago, Chile; 
1×106 cells/kg) or placebo (n=15 per group). UC-MSCs in vitro, compared with bone marrow–derived mesenchymal 
stem cells, displayed a 55-fold increase in the expression of hepatocyte growth factor, known to be involved in 
myogenesis, cell migration, and immunoregulation. UC-MSC–treated patients presented no adverse events related 
to the cell infusion, and none of the patients tested at 0, 15, and 90 days presented alloantibodies to the UC-MSCs 
(n=7). Only the UC-MSC–treated group exhibited significant improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction at 3, 
6, and 12 months of follow-up assessed both through transthoracic echocardiography (P=0.0167 versus baseline) and 
cardiac MRI (P=0.025 versus baseline). Echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction change from baseline 
to month 12 differed significantly between groups (+7.07±6.22% versus +1.85±5.60%; P=0.028). In addition, at all 
follow-up time points, UC-MSC–treated patients displayed improvements of New York Heart Association functional 
class (P=0.0167 versus baseline) and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (P<0.05 versus baseline). At 
study completion, groups did not differ in mortality, heart failure admissions, arrhythmias, or incident malignancy.
Conclusions: Intravenous infusion of UC-MSC was safe in this group of patients with stable heart failure and 
reduced ejection fraction under optimal medical treatment. Improvements in left ventricular function, functional 
status, and quality of life were observed in patients treated with UC-MSCs.

S
tem cell therapy has been under evaluation as a treat-
ment for heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection frac-
tion (HFrEF) for more than a decade. Experimental studies 
report improvements in cardiac function and regeneration of 
damaged heart tissue through mechanisms, including transdif-
ferentiation, cell fusion, and paracrine modulation.1,2 In hu-
man disease, recent reviews suggest that stem cell therapy is 
safe and associated with moderate clinical benefits in survival, 
left ventricular function, and quality of life of patients with 
HFrEF.3–6 Clinical trials in patients with chronic ischemic or 
nonischemic disease have assessed a range of cellular prod-
ucts and delivery routes. These include autologous or allo-
genic bone marrow mononuclear cells and mesenchymal stem 
cells (MSC), administered by intramyocardial injections, per-
cutaneous intracoronary infusion, and exceptionally periph-
eral intravenous infusion.3,4,6 However, after decades of basic 
and clinical research, overall benefit and the best cell source 
and route of administration remain unsettled.

MSCs are multipotent cells with low immunogenic potential 
that can be isolated from adult tissues, including bone marrow, 
adipose tissue, and umbilical cord among other sources. The 
niche of origin represents an essential factor when evaluating bi-
ological differences between cell types because MSC properties 
can be highly influenced by microenvironmental changes.1,7 Most 
experimental and clinical studies have used bone marrow–derived 
MSC (BM-MSC), nonetheless these cells present disadvantages 
for clinical application, including an invasive harvesting proce-
dure and a decreased proliferation and differentiation potential 
related to donor age and comorbidity.8 In contrast, umbilical cord-
derived MSCs (UC-MSC) are easily attainable and expanded in 
vitro, have less cellular aging, and are devoid of ethical concerns. 
Preclinical studies have demonstrated that UC-MSC can express 
cardiac-specific molecules (troponin-I, connexin-43), differen-
tiate into cardiomyocyte-like and endothelial cells in vitro, and 
also exert paracrine effects that enhance vascular regeneration 
and cardiomyocyte protection. Such actions might underlie the 
improvement in cardiac function observed in animal models of 
chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy in 
response to UC-MSCs.9–14 The aim of this prospective, random-
ized, double blinded placebo–controlled trial was to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of a well-characterized source of UC-MSCs 
administered intravenously in patients with chronic HFrEF.

Novelty and Significance
What Is Known?
• Intracoronary and intramyocardial cell therapy, mainly with allogenic 
bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC), has 
shown to be safe and potentially effective in patients with heart failure, 
even if low levels of cell engraftment are expected, suggesting a para-
crine mechanism of action.
• Umbilical cord–derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSC) are of 
easier access and in vitro expansion and exhibit superior angiogenic 
and paracrine effects compared with BM-MSC, but their systemic ad-
ministration in human heart failure patients has not been tested.
What Information Does This Article Contribute?
• This is the first double-blind randomized placebo controlled trial of 
the intravenous administration of UC-MSCs, confirming this a feasible 
and safe treatment in patients with ischemic and nonischemic heart 
failures.
• The UC-MSCs used in this trial exhibited superior clonogenicity, mi-
gration, and paracrine capacities in vitro and less senescence when 
compared with BM-MSCs.
• UC-MSC treatment was associated with significant improvements in 
ventricular systolic function, New York Heart Association functional 
classification, and quality of life indexes.
Cell therapy has been evaluated in cardiovascular diseases for 
more than a decade without reaching consensus on optimal cell 
source or method of application. Trials using BM-MSCs adminis-
tered through invasive local implantation have suggested posi-
tive results and have indicated that allogenic cell sources may be 
superior to autologous MSCs in aged patient population, usually 
with comorbid disease. Herein, we report the first randomized 
placebo controlled clinical trial using UC-MSCs intravenously in 
patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction of both 
ischemic and nonischemic pathogenesis. The results show that 
systemic administration of UC-MSCs is safe in these patients and 
point to significant improvements in functional capacity, quality of 
life, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Moreover, we show this 
highly accessible and allogenic cell source of younger origin than 
BM-MCSs, displayed biological and paracrine advantages, and 
exerted long-term (12 months) clinical effects via intravenous 
administration. This route of administration simplifies therapy, 
decreases costs of the procedure, allows exploration of repeated 
dosages, and should be tested further with UC-MSCs in larger 
trials assessing long-term clinical end points.

trial. The study was conducted at Clínica Santa Maria and Clínica 
Dávila, Chile. Participants were referred from these private health-
care centers or public hospitals and randomized between December 
2012 and June 2014. The experimental design was approved by the 
ethics committee at both participant health centers and the Chilean 
Metropolitan Health Service. Before enrollment, all patients agreed 
to participate and signed an informed consent approved by the insti-
tutional review board. This study was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov.
Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) 18 to 75 years of age, (2) 
chronic HFrEF with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classifi-
cation I to III and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40% at 
echocardiographic assessment, and (3) all patients had to be under 
optimal medical management for at least 3 months before randomiza-
tion, which encompassed class I guideline-recommended therapies 
(angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor 
blocker, β-blocker, and mineralocorticoid receptor blocker) at maxi-
mal tolerable dosages. Ivabradine and sacubtril/valsartan were not 
included given their recent introduction in our country. Exclusion 
criteria were as follows: (1) End-stage HFrEF defined as patients 
with American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart 
Association (ACCF/AHA) stage D (candidates for specialized inter-
ventions, including heart transplantation and mechanical assistance) 
or terminal HF (advanced HF with poor response to all forms of 
treatment, frequent hospitalizations, and life expectancy <6 months). 
(2) Recurrent myocardial ischemia defined as any type of acute 
coronary syndrome 3 months before enrollment. (3) Uncontrolled 
ventricular tachycardia defined by sustained ventricular tachycardia, 
including electrical storm and incessant ventricular tachycardia with 
no response to antiarrhythmic medication. (4) Malignant disease 
with life expectancy <1 year according to tumor, node, metastasis 
classification. (5) Manifest ventricular asynchrony defined by intra-
ventricular asynchrony at qualitative echocardiographic assessment 
(ondulating systolic movement beginning at the interventricular 
septum and extending to other left ventricular segments, with late 
activation of left ventricular lateral wall). Patients with left bundle 
branch block without manifest ventricular asynchrony were allowed 
to enroll. (6) Hematologic disease: anemia (hemoglobin ≤9.5 g/dL); 
leukopenia (<4000/μL); thrombocytopenia (<75 000/μL); myelopro-
liferative disorders, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute or chronic leu-
kemia, and plasma cell dyscrasias (multiple myeloma, amyloidosis). 
(7) Recent cerebrovascular disease (<3 months). (8) Serum creatinine 
>2.26 mg/dL (>200 µmol/L). (9) Atrial fibrillation without optimal 
heart rate control in the last 3 months. Every patient assessed for eligi-
bility was subject to coronary angiography and exercise stress test to 
guarantee the stability of their coronary disease and rule out signs of 
ischemia before inclusion into the protocol. Hence, the patients with 
ischemic cardiomyopathy had predominantly scar.
Eligible patients were enrolled in a 1:1 randomization to intrave-
nous infusion of UC-MSCs or placebo. The randomization list was 
computer generated by a person unrelated to the study. All patients 
were assessed at baseline and at the pre-established follow-up points 
of 3, 6, and 12 months. These evaluations consisted of a clinical as-
sessment for adverse events and NYHA functional classification; 
Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) and 
Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire; laboratory testing in-
cluding complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, brain 
natriuretic peptide, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein; resting 
ECG, signal averaged ECG, 24-hour ECG Holter monitoring; trans-
thoracic echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and 
cardiopulmonary exercise test. Technical specifications on quality of 
life questionnaires, echocardiography, CMR, and cardiopulmonary 
exercise tests are provided below. Clinical researchers, study nurses, 
and patients were blinded to treatment allocation.
Preparation, Characterization, and Infusion  
of UC-MSC
UC-MSC treatments were processed in an ISO 9001:2015 certi-
fied good manufacturing practice type Laboratory (Cells for Cells, 
Santiago, Chile) under good manufacturing practice conditions ac-
cording to the Food and Drug Administration Guidance for indus-
try (current good tissue practice) and additional requirements for 
manufacturers of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based 
products. Umbilical cords were obtained from full-term human pla-
centas by caesarean section after informed consent, from healthy 
donors, and were aseptically stored in sterile PBS supplemented 
with 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Gibco, 
Gran Island). Within 3 hours of birth, the umbilical cord was sec-
tioned and washed with PBS and antibiotics. Wharton’s jelly was 
dissected into small fragments (1–2 mm2 pieces), seeded in 100-mm 
culture plates, and maintained in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle 
Alpha Modifications high glucose (Gibco, Gran Island) supple-
mented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1% 
penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L l-glutamine (Gibco, Gran 
Island). At 48 hours, nonadherent cells were removed, washed with 
PBS, and culture medium was replaced with fresh medium every 3 
days. When the cell culture reached 70% to 80% confluence, cells 
were detached by treatment with TrypLE TM Express (Gibco, Gran 
Island) and reseeded at a density of 2500 cells per cm2 into 500 
cm2 flasks (Nunc, Denmark). At passage 3, UC-MSCs were charac-
terized according to the International Society for Cellular Therapy 
Guidelines,15 harvested, and cryopreserved in Profreeze (Lonza, 
Walkersville) following the manufacturer’s instruction. In vitro 
tests (described in the Online Data Supplement) were performed 
to further characterize the UC-MSCs used in the trial, including 
cell size and doubling time, senescence markers, cardiomyogenic 
differentiation potential, paracrine and immunomodulatory activity, 
and migration capacity of UC-MSCs as compared with BM-MSCs. 
BM-MSCs were obtained from a 18-year-old healthy male under-
going surgery because of hip trauma, and 2 iliac crest samples that 
were from a female and a male healthy donor, aged, respectively, 
23 and 30 years purchased from Lonza. None had cardiovascular 
diseases.
According to the amount of cells required in each case, cryopre-
served vials were thawed and expanded until passage 5 to 6 using 
Minimum Essential Medium Eagle Alpha Modifications supple-
mented with 10% AB plasma. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typ-
ing for these cells was assessed by polymerase chain reaction for 
HLA class I (A, B, C) and class II (DP, DQ, DR). The release criteria 
for clinical use of UC-MSCs included the absence of macroscopic 
clumps, contamination by pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria, 
mycoplasma, syphilis, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human 
immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, and fungi) or endotoxin 
(≤0.5 EU/mL), and a viability ˃80%, with an identity and purity pat-
tern characterized by positivity (≥95%) of CD73, CD90, and CD105 
and negative expression (≤2%) of CD45, CD34, CD14, and HLA-
DR. A total of 1×106 UC-MSCs/kg of body weight were resuspended 
in a final volume of 100 mL of AB plasma. The placebo group re-
ceived 100 mL of autologous plasma. Patients received premedica-
tion with intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg and chlorphenamine 
10 mg, complying the local protocol for prevention of allergic and 
nonhemolytic transfusion reactions. After 30 minutes, they were in-
fused with UC-MSCs or placebo at 2 mL/min via peripheral vein, 
under noninvasive monitoring of vital signs.
Study End Points
The primary safety end points encompassed immediate adverse 
events after intravenous infusion of UC-MSCs or placebo; incidence 
of overall death, major cardiovascular events (defined by the com-
bined outcome of cardiovascular deaths, hospital admission because 
of decompensated HF, nonfatal myocardial infarction), and other 
adverse events, including stroke, sustained ventricular arrhythmias, 
and incident malignancy. The humoral immune response to infused 
allogeneic UC-MSCs was tested in a group of 12 patients (7 treated 
with UC-MSCs, 5 receiving placebo) at days 0, 15, and 90 of infusion 
using Luminex 200 (Kashi Clinical Laboratories Inc., Portland, OR).
The primary efficacy end point was change in LVEF in echo-
cardiography.16 Secondary efficacy end points included changes 
in left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) and end-diastolic 
volume (LVEDV) at echocardiography; LVEF, LVESV, and LVEDV 
in CMR; NYHA functional classification; quality of life question-
naires overall scores; maximum peak oxygen consumption (peak 
VO2) and ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO2 slope) assessed through

cardiopulmonary exercise test; brain natriuretic peptide and high 
sensitivity C-reactive protein.
Transthoracic Echocardiography
Transthoracic echocardiography was performed by 2 experienced 
cardiologists, blind from treatment allocation, from both participating 
centers. Studies were performed in Vivid 7 Dimension Cardiovascular 
Ultrasound System (General Electric Healthcare). LVEF was mea-
sured through modified Simpson biplane method, and LVESV and 
LVEDV were measured at parasternal long axis in 4 and 2 chambers. 
Chamber quantifications, diastolic dysfunction, and global longi-
tudinal strain were measured according to recommendations of the 
American Society of Echocardiography.17,18
Cardiac Magnetic Resonance
CMR studies were performed on a 1.5-Tesla magnetic resonance sys-
tem using cardiac phased-array SENSE coil with 5 channels (Philips 
Achieva, The Netherlands). All scans were obtained by a single op-
erator and at a single institution (Clinica Davila, Chile). The imaging 
protocol included axial, coronal, and sagittal scout images to localize 
the heart; afterward balanced steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine 
ECG-gated sequence in 4-chamber, 3-chamber, long axis, and short-
axis planes were performed for left ventricular functional assessment. 
Images were transferred to the workstation (Philips Extended MR 
Workspace, 2.6.3.5, The Netherlands) for post-processing. Global 
left ventricular function was quantified by radiologists blinded to 
treatment allocation, using Segment v1.9 software (Medviso AB, 
Sweden).19 Endocardial and epicardial contours were drawn on short-
axis end-diastolic and end-systolic images by radiologists, blinded 
to treatment allocation and affiliated to an independent institution 
(Hospital Clinico Universidad de Chile, Chile). Papillary muscles and 
endocardial trabeculations were included into left ventricular volume. 
A total of 8 to 12 short-axis segments were needed to encompass the 
entire left ventricle.
Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test
Standardized symptom-limited cardiopulmonary test exercise pro-
tocols with treadmill or cycle ergometry were performed, based on 
availability of the technique at each healthcare center of recruitment. 
Gas exchange measurements analyzed for each breathing cycle were 
performed using metabolic charts. Exercise capacity variables, in-
cluding peak VO2, VE/VCO2, metabolic equivalents (METS), oxygen 
consumption at anaerobic threshold, peak respiratory exchange ratio, 
and exercise time, were recorded.
Quality of Life Questionnaires
Patients answered validated translations of MLHFQ and Kansas City 
Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. MLHFQ is a 21-item self-adminis-
tered questionnaire assessing the patients’ perception of the effects of 
HF on physical, socioeconomic, and psychological aspects of their 
life.20 Scores range between 0 and 105, and higher scores indicate 
worst quality of life.20 Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire is 
a 23-item self-administered questionnaire addressing specific health 
domains pertaining to HF: physical limitation, symptoms, quality of 
life, social limitation, symptom stability, and self-efficacy.21 The first 
4 domains combine into a clinical summary score. Scores range from 
0 to 100, and higher scores point to lower symptom burden and better 
quality of life.21
Statistical Analysis
Continuous data are expressed as mean±SD and categorical data as 
absolute number. Categorical data were compared using Pearson χ2 
test. Continuous data were assessed by Shapiro–Wilk test for nor-
mality. Comparison between groups at baseline was assessed through 
unpaired t test or Mann–Whitney U test according to normality. 
Intraindividual comparison of continuous variables at baseline with 
those at follow-up was performed with paired t test or Wilcoxon rank-
sum test according to normality. Statistical significance was assumed 
at a value of P<0.05. For comparisons of various post-treatment eval-
uations versus baseline, Bonferroni α correction was performed, and 
statistical significance was assumed at a value of P<0.0167. CMR 
studies were additionally analyzed through a mixed effect maximum 
likelihood regression. In vitro data are expressed as mean±SEM and 
were compared using 1-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni cor-
rection. A value of P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
Analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 (IBM Corp) 
and STATA 12.0 (StataCorp).
Results
Characterization of the UC-MSCs
UC-MSCs and BM-MSCs were grown and characterized for 
surface markers as described above. Their capacity to differ-
entiate to mesodermal lineages was confirmed under specific 
osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic differentiation con-
ditions (Online Figure I). Cell size, doubling time, and senes-
cence markers can be seen in the Online Figure II.
Cardiac Differentiation Potential
Treatment with 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) for 25 days induced 
cardiomyogenic differentiation of UC-MSCs, revealed by the 
expression of specific markers, including transcription factors 
involved in myogenesis (NKx2.5, GATA-4, and MEF2C) and 
other genes (MYH7B, GJA1, and TNNT2). The expression of 
all 6 genes was induced in both cell sources although BM-
MSCs exhibited higher mRNA levels as shown by reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction (P˂0.001; Figure 1A). 
Conexin-43 staining also had greater expression in BM-
MSCs than in UC-MSCs (24.33±1.84% versus 17.42±1.43%; 
P=0.018). In contrast, troponin expression seemed increased in 
UC-MSCs (23.47±7.94% versus 9.06±2.61% for BM-MSCs) 
but did not reach significance (P=0.166; Figure 1B). Beating 
was not observed in MSCs after induction with 5-AZA.
Paracrine Profile
UC-MSCs showed a higher transforming growth factor beta 
3 (TGF-β3) gene expression in comparison with BM-MSCs 
(P<0.001), but vascular endothelial growth factor expression 
levels in comparison with BM-MSCs was not significantly 
different (Figure 1C). Of note, UC-MSCs showed a 55-fold 
higher expression of hepatocyte growth factor in compari-
son with BM-MSCs (P>0.0001; Figure 1C), that in some 
cases showed undetected levels of hepatocyte growth factor. 
Comparative quantification of indoleamine 2 3-dioxygenase 
(IDO) activity, interleukin 6 (IL6), TGF-β1, prostaglandin E2 
(PGE2), HLA-G, and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) at 
basal and stimulated condition of UC-MSCs and BM-MSCs 
can be seen at Online Figure III.
Immunomodulatory Effects
The immunosuppressive properties of UC-MSCs were as-
sessed by evaluating their effect on the proliferative re-
sponse of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after 
phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation in vitro. UC-MSCs 
exhibited a similar inhibitory effect on T-cell proliferation 
compared with BM‐MSCs at the 1:10 ratio, and inhibition 
percentages were 21.53±3.85% and 23.96±4.50% for UC-
MSCs and BM-MSCs, with respect to PHA-induced pro-
liferation in the absence of MSCs (P<0.005 versus control; 
Figure 2A). T helper 1, T helper 2, and cytotoxic T cells

exhibited a tendency to decrease their proliferation after co-
cultured with UC-MSCs or BM-MSCs (P>0.05). No effect 
of the MSC cocultures was observed on regulatory T-cell 
proliferation (Figure 2B).
Migration Profile in Response to HFrEF Patient’s 
Serum
The percentage of migrating cells was significantly higher in 
UC-MSCs compared with BM-MSCs in response to HFrEF 
patient’s serum (41.18±6.53% versus 29.67±8.35%; P<0.01; 
Figure 3).
Patient Population
From December 2012 to June 2014, 65 patients were assessed 
for eligibility, 30 patients underwent randomization (n=15 
per group; Figure 4). Baseline characteristics of the UC-MSC 
and placebo groups did not differ in terms of demographic 
variables, cardiovascular risk factors, NYHA class, and elec-
trocardiography (Table 1). Ischemic cardiomyopathy was 
the predominant pathogenesis of HFrEF (21 patients, 70%). 
There were no differences between groups concerning thera-
peutic agents that modify cardiac remodeling. No patient had 
cardiac implantable electronic devices. One patient from each 
group had left bundle branch block although none presented 
manifest ventricular asynchrony at baseline. Patients treated 
with placebo presented higher brain natriuretic peptide levels 
and 25% greater LVEDV at baseline (P<0.05).
Safety
There were no acute adverse events associated with the in-
fusion of allogenic UC-MSCs or placebo. None of the tested 
Figure 1. Umbilical cord–derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) and marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) 
displayed different cardiac differentiation potential and paracrine factors profile. Cardiac differentiation was induced in UC-MSCs 
and BM-MSCs by cultured with 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) 10 µmol/L during 25 d. Cardiac differentiation potential was evaluated through 
mRNA relative expression of cardiac gene (NCx2.5, GATA-4, MEF2C, MYH7B, GJA1, and TNNT2) by real time polymerase chain reaction

individuals (7 treated with UC-MSC and 5 receiving pla-
cebo) developed alloantigen-directed antibodies post-infu-
sion. Of note, 1 female patient with baseline reactivity to 52 
different HLA specificities before UC-MSC treatment lost 
reactivity to 16 of these specificities at day 90. Furthermore, 
because we typed the infused cells, we could detect that 
only 21% of specificities not expressed on the infused 
MSCs disappeared, as opposed to 100% of those present on 
the infused MSCs (P=0.004). Our data not only confirm the 
absence of humoral immune reaction to UC-MSCs but also 
suggest that MSCs preferentially suppress reactivity to their 
own HLA molecules.
Clinically relevant events throughout the 12 months of fol-
low-up are shown in Table 2. The deceased patient from the 
placebo group had an acute myocardial infarction at 5 months 
of follow-up. The patient from the UC-MSC group presented 
an acute lymphocytic leukemia at 5 months from intravenous 
infusion of UC-MSC, lacking clinical and laboratory elements 
suggestive of leukemia at baseline and at 3 months of follow-
up. One patient from the placebo group developed a malignant 
melanoma. Concerning major cardiovascular events, 3 patients 
from the placebo group and 1 from the UC-MSC group had 
hospitalizations because of decompensated HF, only 1 pa-
tient experienced an acute coronary syndrome in the placebo 
group. None of the patients had an acute ischemic stroke. No 
new-onset supraventricular arrhythmias, sustained ventricular 
arrhythmias, atrioventricular blocks, or bundle branch blocks 
were diagnosed during follow-up, and none were observed at 
ECG Holter monitoring. There was an increase in the amount of 
premature ventricular complexes at 24-hour ECG monitoring in 
the placebo group at follow-up albeit without changes in mean 
Lown classification (Online Table I). No noteworthy variations 
were observed in time or frequency domains at follow-up. No 
thoracic ectopic tissue formation was observed in CMR at com-
pletion of this study. No significant abnormalities were seen in 
complete blood counts, renal and liver function during monitor-
ing points.

Cardiac Imaging
Echocardiographic parameters evaluated at baseline and fol-
low-up are depicted in Table 3. Compared with baseline, there 
were improvements in LVEF in the UC-MSC–treated group 
that began at 3 months of follow-up (+3.71±5.01%; P=0.010) 
and continued at 6 months (+5.43±4.99%; P=0.001) and 12 
months (+7.07±6.22%; P=0.001). There were no changes in 
left ventricular volumes. The placebo group showed no ma-
jor differences in these variables. The change of LVEF from 
baseline to month 12 differed significantly for both groups 
(+7.07±6.22% versus +1.85±5.60%; P=0.028).
CMR measurements are shown in Table 3. Patients treated 
with intravenous infusion of UC-MSCs presented an increase 
of LVEF (P=0.0003) and LVEDV (P=0.012; Figure 5). The 
most significant improvements of LVEF was at 6 months of 
follow-up (+4.67±4.51; P=0.005). There was an increase in 
LVEDV in the UC-MSC group at 12 months (P=0.033). We 
observed no changes in LVEF or left ventricular volumes in 
the placebo group (n=13). One patient from the placebo group 
withdrew consent for CMR.
Functional Status, Quality of Life, and Clinical 
Biomarkers
Results are summarized in Table 3. There were substantial im-
provements in NYHA class in patients treated with UC-MSCs, 
starting at 3 months (−0.54±0.56; P=0.011), which remained 
at 12 months follow-up (−0.62±0.46; P=0.003). Only the 
UC-MSC group experienced improvements in MLHFQ from 
baseline to all follow-up points (P<0.05). Both groups experi-
enced an initial improvement of Kansas City Cardiomyopathy 
Questionnaire clinical summary at 3 and 6 months of follow-
up, with persistence of improvement at trial completion only 
in the UC-MSC–treated group (P=0.014). Patients treated 
with UC-MSCs exhibited an improvement in VE/VCO2 at 12 
months (−1.89±3.19; P=0.023 versus baseline) while no dif-
ferences were observed in peak VO2. We found no differences 
in other exercise capacity variables, including METS, oxy-
gen consumption at anaerobic threshold, peak respiratory 
exchange ratio, and exercise time after cell therapy (Online 
Table II). We observed a slight decrease in brain natriuretic 
peptide levels in the group treated with UC-MSCs at 3 and 12 
months of follow-up.
Discussion
RIMECARD is the first randomized, double-blind, placebo 
controlled clinical trial with intravenous infusion of allogenic 
UC-MSCs in patients with chronic HFrEF. Intravenous infu-
sions of UC-MSCs are safe in this population and suggest 
benefits in surrogate clinical end points, including LVEF, 
functional status, and quality of life, in patients with HFrEF 
receiving this form of systemic stem cell therapy.
MSC-based therapies have been considered overall safe 
procedures. A recent systematic review of 36 prospective clin-
ical trials for several clinical conditions, including myocar-
dial infarction and chronic cardiomyopathy, did not detect an 
association between intravascular infusions of MSCs and the 
risk of acute infusion toxicity, organ system complications, in-
fection, death, or malignancy in treated patients.22 Systematic 
reviews in HF population actually describe an association be-
tween stem cell therapy and a reduction of mortality and ma-
jor cardiovascular events albeit most of the analyzed studies 
used intramyocardial injection or percutaneous intracoronary 
infusion of bone marrow mononuclear cells.4,5 There is lim-
ited experience on intravenous administration of MSCs in pa-
tients with cardiovascular diseases, mainly because of safety 
concerns on the entrapment of donor cells in pulmonary cir-
culation and apprehensions on their therapeutic efficacy in a 
context of low cardiac engraftment. A phase 2 study by Hare 
et al23 supports the safety of intravenous administration of al-
logenic BM-MSCs (up to 5×106 cells/kg) in acute myocardial 
infarction. At 6 months of follow-up, MSC-treated patients 
had similar adverse event rates, a trend toward decreased in

hospitalization rate and a decrease in arrhythmic events versus 
placebo.23 In addition, there were benefits in pulmonary func-
tion at 6 months and lack of evidence of pulmonary ectopic 
formations in CMR studies performed at 12 months.23 A re-
cent crossover phase 2 clinical trial by Butler et al24 assessed 
the safety of the intravenous administration of ischemia-toler-
ant allogenic BM-MSCs versus placebo in patients with non-
ischemic cardiomyopathy. At 90 days of follow-up, this trial 
reported no differences in death, hospitalizations, and serious 
adverse events between groups.24 Considering both studies and 
our results, the intravenous delivery of UC-MSCs seems safe 
in HFrEF population. Intravenous infusion of UC-MSCs was 
not associated with a decrease in the incidence of ventricular 
arrhythmias, unlike the study by Hare et al23; a difference that 
could be because of several reasons including different patient 
populations, MSC dosages, and monitoring time points.
Our trial displayed improvements in LVEF in patients re-
ceiving intravenous UC-MSC treatment albeit no noteworthy 
reductions in LVESV or LVEDV were observed. Randomized 
clinical trials with autologous and allogenic MSCs have re-
ported differing results on evolution of left ventricular systolic 
function and volumes.24–32 In the dose-escalation POSEIDON 
trial (Percutaneous Stem Cell Injection Delivery Effects on 
Neomyogenesis Pilot Study), patients with ischemic HF who 
received transendocardial injections of autologous and allo-
genic BM-MSCs showed nonclinically relevant improvement 
on LVEF within 13 months (mean increase +1.96%; P=0.11; 
n=27).25 In the later POSEIDON-DCM trial (Percutaneous 
Stem Cell Injection Delivery Effects On Neomyogenesis in 
Dilated Cardiomyopathy), a phase I/II randomized clinical 
trial in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy 
comparing transendocardial injections of allogenic versus 
autologous BM-MSCs (100×106 cells), an increase in LVEF 
was described for patients receiving allogenic BM-MSCs at 
12 months (+8.0%; P=0.004; n=18) while patients with autol-
ogous BM-MSCs exhibited nonsignificant changes (+5.4%; 
P=0.116; n=16); there were no changes in ventricular vol-
umes for both groups.30 In the C-CURE trial (Cardiopoietic 
Stem Cell Therapy in Heart Failure), the group of patients 
with ischemic HFrEF treated with a combination of autolo-
gous BM-MSCs exposed to a cytokine cocktail for cardiogen-
ic differentiation (mean dose, 733×106 cells; n=32), presented 
noteworthy improvements in LVEF (+6.8%; P<0.0001) and 
LVESV (−16 mL; P<0.0001) at 6-month follow-up.26 In the 
TAC-HFT (Transendocardial Autologous Cells in Ischemic 
Heart Failure Trial), patients with ischemic HF receiving 
intramyocardial injections of autologous BM-MSCs (100–
200×106 cells; n=19) showed nonsignificant trends toward 
improvement in LVEF, LVESV, and LVEDV at 12 months.27 
In the MSC-HF trial (Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal 
Stromal Cell Treatment in Patients With Severe HF), patients 
with ischemic HF receiving intramyocardial injections of au-
tologous BM-MSCs (mean dose, 77.5×106 cells; n=40) exhib-
ited an increase in LVEF (+5.0%; P<0.0001) and a decrease 
in LVESV (−7.6 mL; P=0.001) while no changes in LVEDV 
were observed at 6-month follow-up28. A phase 2 dose-esca-
lation study in patients with HFrEF performed by Perin et 
al,32 assessing transendocardial injections of immunoselected

allogenic BM-MSCs (25, 75, and 150×106 cells; n=15 per 
group), revealed no differences in LVEF at 12 months of 
follow-up although the 150×106 MSC group had a significant 
reduction in LVESV and LVEDV at 6 months and a nonsig-
nificant decrease of both ventricular volumes at 12 months. 
In a randomized trial by Zhao et al29 in patients with decom-
pensated HFrEF, individuals receiving intracoronary injec-
tions of allogenic UC-MSCs (n=30) presented improvements 
in LVEF (+19.0±6.8%; P<0.01) and LVESV (−13.14±10.62 
mL; P<0.05) at 6 months. In the recent trial by Butler et al,24 
patients with HFrEF receiving ischemia-tolerant allogenic 
BM-MSCs (1.5×106 cells/kg, n=10) experienced a signifi-
cant increase in LVEF (+2.31%; P=0.02) and reductions in 
LVEDV (−17.86 mL; P=0.04) and LVESV (−16.60 mL; 
P=0.02) at 3 months. Remarkably, the ixCELL-DCM trial 
(Transendocardial Injection of Ixmyelocel-T in Patients With 
Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy) reported a reduction in 
the combined outcome of all-cause mortality and cardiovas-
cular admissions (relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% confidence 
interval, 0.42–0.97; P=0.0344) in patients with symptomatic 
HFrEF receiving transendocardial injections of ixmyelocel-
T (n=58), a multicellular therapy produced from autologous 
bone marrow mononuclear cells—with selective expansion of 
MSCs and macrophages—versus placebo (n=51).31 These pa-
tients receiving ixmyelocel-T experienced no change in LVEF 
or ventricular volumes.31 The CHART-1 trial (Congestive 
Heart Failure Cardiopoietic Regenerative Therapy) showed 
neutral results on composite and individual outcomes, includ-
ing all-cause mortality, worsening HF events, and surrogate 
end points (LVEF, LVESV, LVEDV, and MLHFQ), in HFrEF 
patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy receiving intramyo-
cardial injections of cardiopoietic cells (MSCs; n=120) ver-
sus sham procedures (n=151).33 Exploratory analysis from 
CHART-1 suggests a benefit in treated individuals with base-
line LVEDV >200 mL; unlike our trial, in which most treated 
patients had lower baseline LVEDV. A recent retrospective 
cohort of 2166 outpatients with HF by Kalogeropoulos et al 
concluded that patients who experienced recovery of LVEF 
(defined as current LVEF >40% but any previously docu-
mented LVEF ≤40% by transthoracic echocardiography) had 
fewer all-cause mortality (RR, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 
0.55–0.91), cardiovascular hospitalizations (RR, 0.50; 95% 
confidence interval, 0.35–0.71), and HF-related hospitaliza-
tion (RR, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.30–0.76) com-
pared with patients with HFrEF or HF with preserved LVEF.34 
In the POSEIDON-DCM trial, such recovery of LVEF was 
achieved by 46.7% of patients receiving allogenic BM-MSCs 
and 22.2% of patients treated with autologous BM-MSCs,30 
whereas in our study, this occurred in 50% (7 of 14) of UC-
MSC–treated individuals versus 7.1% (1 of 14) of the pla-
cebo group at month 12 (P=0.0365). Albeit ours is a small 
series, only the UC-MSC–treated group exhibited significant 
improvements in LVEF at 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up, 
both by transthoracic echocardiography (P=0.0167 versus 
baseline) and CMR (P=0.025 versus baseline). This suggests 
that our patients might experience benefits on major clinical 
outcomes although this observation requires verification in a 
larger phase 3 clinical trial.
Improvements in NYHA and quality of life questionnaires 
were observed in the UC-MSC group also, in agreement 
with results from other MSC-based therapy clinical trials in 
HF.24–28,30 Interestingly, at 12 months of the POSEIDON-DCM 
trial, the groups receiving allogenic BM-MSCs had 66.7% 
of patients with improved NYHA functional class and a sub-
stantial decrease in mean MLHFQ scores, while patients re-
ceiving autologous BM-MSCs exposed only a trend toward 
improvement.30 We appreciated a low concordance between 
improvement on NYHA classification and performance at 
cardiopulmonary exercise test, a phenomena previously de-
scribed.35 Cardiopulmonary exercise tests have been seldom 
performed in cell therapy trials and with wide-ranging re-
sults. Regarding MSCs therapies, to our knowledge, only the 
POSEIDON and TAC-HFT assessed peak VO2, describing no 
changes for this outcome in patients treated with autologous 
BM-MSCs.25,27 We did not observe changes in this variable 
although we identified a modest improvement in ventilatory 
efficiency in patients treated with UC-MSCs at 12 months. 
Recent evidence suggests that VE/VCO2 is an excellent mark-
er of severity and prognosis of HF, better than peak VO2 at 
reflecting the complex interplay of pulmonary, cardiac, and 
peripheral manifestations in HF population.36,37 The lack of 
major benefits in cardiopulmonary performance can be at-
tributed to several factors. Honold et al38 in a subanalysis of 
patients with poor, moderate, and conserved cardiopulmonary 
test results before cell therapy documented that patients with 
lowest initial exercise capacity showed largest improvements 
in peak VO2 and VE/VCO2 after intracoronary stem cell infu-
sion. Our patients had slight alterations at baseline, therefore 
limited benefits could be anticipated.
A range of mechanisms have been proposed to explain 
the clinical benefit observed in patients with HF treated with 
MSCs, including reductions in myocardial cell apoptosis, 
modulation of inflammation, myocardial fibrosis, neovascu-
larization, and increased cell differentiation.13 Incorporation 
of MSCs into tissues is regulated by multiple processes, in-
cluding cell recruitment, migration, and adhesion.39 The 
higher migration of UC-MSCs in response to HFrEF patient 
serum, herein described, is compatible with the notion that 
this cell type might sense biological cues that are contributory 
to their therapeutic effect by systemic delivery.

 Bartolucci et al  Umbilical Cord MSCs for Heart Failure  1201
In our study, UC-MSCs and BM-MSCs expressed car-
diomyogenic differentiation potential although BM-MSCs 
presented a more favorable profile of transcription factors re-
lated to cardiac differentiation. Despite early reports describ-
ing cell engraftment and differentiation in animal models of 
HF, later studies evidence retention rates <0.5% after 4 days 
of intramyocardial injections of BM-MSCs,40 which seem 
insufficient to account for the magnitude of clinical benefit. 
Mounting evidence rather suggests the reparative actions of 
MSCs rely on paracrine modulation.1,2 The comparative re-
sults of the paracrine factors assessed in this work point to a 
significant advantage of UC-MSCs over BM-MSCs. The most 
striking difference was the prominent expression of hepatocyte 
growth factor in UC-MSCs from all tested donors while BM-
MSCs showed low to undetectable levels. Remarkably, sev-
eral studies in chronic ischemic or nonischemic HF animal 
models have reported that gene transfection of hepatocyte 
growth factor promotes angiogenesis and decreases fibro-
sis and apoptosis, attenuating cardiac remodeling and im-
proving myocardial remodeling, perfusion, and contractile 
function.41–45 Furthermore, MSCs share several biological 
properties with endothelial cells, enabling them to contribute 
to angiogenesis. Preclinical data from several groups includ-
ing ours suggest that UC-MSCs can enhance angiogenesis by 
promoting the formation of capillary-like structures in vitro or 
increasing capillary density in vivo through upregulation of

various proangiogenic factors and chemokines, including vas-
cular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietin, and monocyte 
chemoattractant protein-1 among others.12,13,46,47 Liu et al14 
have described that intracoronary and intravenous infusion of 
UC-MSCs was associated with a promotion of angiogenesis 
through paracrine modulation and perhaps endothelial cell 
differentiation, an augmented myocardial perfusion and en-
hancement of collateral vessel development in a porcine model 
of a chronic myocardial ischemia. In the same study, animals 
treated with UC-MSCs had improved LVEF and a reduction 
of myocardial fibrosis and apoptosis.14 Moreover, allogenic 
MSCs can improve endothelial function and vascular reactivi-
ty through stimulation of endothelial progenitor cell mobiliza-
tion in patients with HF.30,48 Interestingly, the PROMETHEUS 
trial (Prospective Randomized Study of Mesenchymal Stem 
Cell Therapy in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery) as-
sessed the impact of intramyocardial injections of autologous 
BM-MSCs into the akinetic nonrevascularized myocardial 
segments of patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy, 
reporting an improvement in myocardial perfusion and func-
tional recovery, and subsequently an improvement in global 
left ventricular function.49
Limitations
The assessment of differences in major cardiovascular out-
comes and surrogate efficacy outcomes was underpowered 
because of the small number of participants from each patient 
group. Post hoc analysis considering echocardiographic as-
sessment of LVEF at 12 months revealed an estimated power 
of 71%. This discouraged further analysis to discriminate 
responders from nonresponders to therapy or differences on 
cardiomyopathy substrate. Differences in left ventricular vol-
umes at baseline, in spite of randomization, could bias effi-
cacy results in favor of UC-MSC. However, the subanalysis 
of CHART-1 is reassuring in that most benefit in response to 
treatment occurred precisely in patients with higher baseline 
LVEDV, suggesting that such bias might not be in favor of our 
UC-MSC group. We could not perform myocardial perfusion 
and fibrosis measurements because of noncontrast CMR im-
aging and software restraints, nonetheless these had not been 
considered as secondary end points of the study.
Conclusions
Intravenous infusion of UC-MSCs was feasible and safe in 
this group of patients with HFrEF under otherwise optimal 
medical therapy. Allogenic UC-MSC treatment induced no 
humoral immune response in tested individuals. The interven-
tion resulted in a significant improvement in left ventricular 
function, functional status, and quality of life. These findings 
suggest that UC-MSCs could have an impact on clinical out-
comes, supporting further testing through large clinical trials.
