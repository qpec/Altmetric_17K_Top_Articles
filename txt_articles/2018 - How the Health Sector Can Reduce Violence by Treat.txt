How the Health Sector Can Reduce Violence by Treating it as a Contagion 
Gary Slutkin, MD, Charles Ransford, MPP, and Daria Zvetina 
 
Abstract 
Violence is best understood as an epidemic health problem, and it can be 
effectively prevented and treated using health methods to stop events 
and outbreaks and to reduce its spread. This health framing is important 
because it recognizes that violence is a threat to the health of 
populations, that exposure to violence causes serious health problems, 
and that violent behavior is contagious and can be treated as a 
contagious process. Relatively standard and highly effective health 
approaches to changing behaviors and norms are increasingly being 
applied to the problem of violence and are showing strong evidence of 
impact among individuals and communities. We need to mobilize our 
nation’s health care and public health systems and methods to work with 
communities and other sectors to stop this epidemic. 
 
Introduction 
Because of its pervasiveness and far-reaching effects, violence is one of the most 
devastating national and global challenges we face. In the United States, homicide is the 
fifth leading cause of death for those under age 45 [1]. Violence not only causes injury 
and death; it also erodes the physical, psychological, social, and economic health and 
development of nearly everyone in affected communities, reducing life expectancy, 
inflicting trauma, limiting opportunity and achievement, and further entrenching 
inequities [2-10]. 
 
Recent advances in neuroscience, behavioral science, and epidemiology demonstrate 
that violence behaves like other contagious epidemics [11], yet violence is not primarily 
managed by the health sector, and health professionals are not the principal 
spokespersons or policy advocates on the issue. While health and public health methods 
for stopping violence exist and have been proven effective, they are underutilized and 
under-resourced [12, 13]. 
 
Health professionals have ethical responsibilities to fully understand violence; to convey 
accurate information to patients, families, and the community; to provide the best care 
and follow-up to ensure recovery from violence; and to help prevent violence. We health 
professionals also have an ethical obligation to educate the public and policymakers

about the new scientific understanding of violence as a contagious process that has 
emerged. It is our job to share this new understanding to shift the world’s thinking 
toward scientifically grounded solutions for violence prevention. This paper outlines 
what is known about violence as a health issue and contagious process, effective 
programs for reducing violence, and practitioners’ obligations to reverse this epidemic by 
acting on this new knowledge.  
 
Violence Is a Contagious Health Problem 
It is now scientifically clear that violence behaves like a contagious and epidemic disease 
[11]. Violence meets the dictionary definition of disease (characteristic signs and 
symptoms causing morbidity and mortality [14]) and of contagious (transmissible, 
causing more of itself [11]). Violence also exhibits the population and individual 
characteristics of contagious epidemics—clustering, geo-temporal spreading, and 
person-to-person transmission [11, 15-21]. Incubation periods, defined as the time 
from infection to evidence of clinical disease, are variable in both infectious diseases and 
violence. Some other infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis have 
incubation periods that range from weeks to years. Incubation periods for violence can 
also vary greatly. They can be rapid (as with cholera) for riots, gang wars, or the genocide 
in Rwanda [22], or they can be longer (as with tuberculosis) for family or community 
violence, where the period between being subjected to child abuse, for example, and 
becoming a perpetrator of violence may be years or decades [23, 24].  
 
People at heightened risk for violence have acquired this susceptibility in the same way 
that people acquire other contagious diseases—through exposure. The particular 
contagion of violence is initiated by victimization or visual exposure and mediated by the 
brain, just as the lungs mediate replication of tuberculosis or the intestines cholera. The 
brain processes violence exposure into scripts, or copied behaviors, and unconscious 
social expectations. This processing can also lead to several situationally adaptive 
responses including aggression, impulsivity, depression, stress, exaggerated startle 
responses, and changes in neurochemistry [12]. The result in each case is production of 
more of what there was an exposure to, i.e., transmission to subsequent person(s) or 
groups.  
 
Past exposure to violence is the strongest predictor of violent behavior  [25], and each 
violent event represents missed prior opportunities for prevention and current 
opportunities to stem progression and spread. Studies have shown that exposure to 
violence from victimization or direct visual exposure increases the risk of chronic violent 
behavior thirtyfold [15]. Exposure to peers who are victims in one’s social network also 
increases the risk of violent victimization [25], similar to the elevated infection risks of 
close contacts of persons with tuberculosis [26].

As is the case in most contagious processes, not all persons exposed express the clinical 
condition of violent behavior, as there are factors that influence uptake—in particular, 
proximity, dose, and age. Other factors, such as poverty, poor education, and family 
structure, should be understood as modulating factors [12]. As with other diseases, 
these modulating factors are important, but specific strategies for interrupting 
progression in a person or transmission in the community provide the best opportunities 
for reversal of the problem. These processes, whereby persons exposed to violence are 
at heightened risk for perpetration of violence, are thought to be responsible for 
contagions of child abuse, intimate partner violence, street violence, suicide, mass 
shootings, riots, and terrorism [27]. These types of violence should be understood as 
syndromes of the same disease process that differ by context. 
 
Health and Public Health Methods to Prevent Violence 
New methods are now available for stopping the spread of violence that are tailored to 
its disease-like characteristics. The public health sector has a strong record of effectively 
preventing disease—including stopping epidemic disease—changing norms and 
behaviors, and reaching high-risk populations. The epidemic control approach to reducing 
violence will be highly recognizable to those who have worked in infectious and epidemic 
control. Community-based health workers are selected, trained, supervised, and 
supported under the guidance of the health sector. Health workers map out areas of 
highest transmission and symptom manifestation, reach out to and intervene with those 
displaying clinical signs to reduce further transmission using methods tailored to the 
infectious agent at play, detect close contacts and others with emergent symptoms or at 
highest risk of future contraction, and render all those at highest risk less symptomatic 
and likely to transmit. Through these methods, health workers reduce spread of the 
contagion and reverse the epidemic process. As with other contagious health problems 
such as AIDS and Ebola, new protective behaviors and norms are then promoted and 
supported at the community level [28].  
 
Over the last 15 years, Cure Violence (the initiative with which the authors are affiliated) 
and other organizations have used these epidemic control methods to reduce 
community violence in dozens of communities in the US and around the world [27, 29]. 
The Cure Violence approach employs violence interrupters, outreach workers, and 
hospital responders to prevent violent events and retaliations, reduce risk among those 
most likely to become violent, and shift norms to discourage the use of violence. Violence 
interrupters work to detect and interrupt conflicts to prevent them from escalating into 
potentially fatal violence. Outreach workers identify those at highest risk and work to 
decrease their likelihood of violence by addressing their risk factors. Community-based 
hospital responders provide immediate crisis intervention to victims of violence at 
hospital trauma centers, work to prevent retaliation or subsequent re-injury, and 
address psychological trauma that the victims experience as a result of their violent 
victimization. Each of these workers is hired from the communities being served based

upon their credibility with those at highest risk and is extensively trained in techniques 
needed for the work, including methods of conflict detection and mediation, behavior 
change, norm change, and epidemic control strategies. This approach to violence 
reduction is complementary to and augments the vital public safety role of law 
enforcement. 
 
Independent multisite evaluations of programs using this approach have found 
significant reductions in violence. An evaluation of the Cure Violence approach 
implemented in Chicago found that the Chicago program was associated with an up to 
almost 70 percent reduction in shootings and killings in some areas and an up to 100 
percent reduction in retaliatory homicides across seven sites over a 33-79 month period 
[30]. In Baltimore, one historically violent neighborhood had a 56 percent decrease in 
killings and 34 percent decrease in shootings over a two-year period [31]. In New York 
City, two evaluations found significant reductions in shootings and killings, including a 
recent evaluation that found a 63 percent reduction in shootings in the Bronx over a 
four-year period  [32, 33]; and one site surpassed 1,000 days without a gun killing in the 
community [34]. Similar results are being reported in several other cities in the US and 
abroad [35]. 
 
Ethical Implications of Understanding Violence as a Health Issue 
Given evidence of the contagious nature of violence and the effectiveness of violence 
prevention programs using the epidemic control approach, our understanding of our role 
as health practitioners in relation to the problem of violence must now evolve. First, as 
part of our ethical obligations, we must more fully understand the essential components 
for providing competent care and follow up to victims of violence, including those with 
physical injuries, those traumatized by exposure, and communities as a whole. In some 
instances, and particularly in the case of community violence, victims of violence are at 
greater risk to be involved in future violence. Thus, in addition to acute care, we must 
provide intervention aimed at reducing risk of patients’ re-injury, retaliation, or 
engagement in subsequent violence. Persons traumatized from exposure to violence 
must be identified and treated based upon the severity of their trauma. There is a role for 
all health practitioners who come into contact with people exposed to violence in 
providing screening, trauma-informed care, and follow up.  
 
Health professionals should also provide information on violence as a contagious health 
problem to patients and the community so that individuals can limit their own exposure 
and seek treatment for trauma when needed. Patient education is a regular role for 
health practitioners in working to change behaviors, such as dietary behaviors, 
encouraging safe sex practices, or recommending other types of preventative 
interventions.

Finally, as health practitioners, we have credibility as spokespersons and thus need to 
step into this role more proactively and with greater visibility. We have the ability to 
provide a health framework on violence and its transmission, as we did for AIDS and 
Ebola, and to encourage more effective policies and practices that will lead to better 
outcomes. During most epidemics, fear is prevalent, but accurate information provided 
by health professionals helps ensure the best responses to and outcomes for those 
affected and the general public.  
 
Conclusion 
Violence is best understood as an epidemic health problem. It is transmitted through 
exposure, which is mediated by the brain and social processes, and can be effectively 
prevented and treated using health methods. This scientifically grounded understanding 
of violence holds potential for a fundamental shift in how violence and persons who 
show symptoms of it are treated. Recognition and treatment of violence as a health 
crisis is long overdue. To date, the health sector and health professionals have been 
highly underutilized for the prevention, treatment, and control of violence [36]. Health 
practitioners—from pediatricians to emergency medical personnel, from nurses to public 
health professionals, from mental health professionals to trauma specialists, and 
especially community health workers—need to step up and use new detection and 
intervention methods to treat violence and to advocate for competent care for all, both 
through existing health care institutions and a more robust community health system. 
These new methods should be widely used and supported within the health sector and in 
the community through trainings, curricula, and standards of practice, and further 
advanced through a reprioritization of resources to support health-based approaches to 
reducing and preventing violence. Now is the time to for our nation’s health care and 
public health systems to work with communities and other sectors to stop this epidemic. 
Each of us has a role in making this happen.
