Abstract
Objective—The aim of this study was to identify temporal associations of anxiety dimensions 
with menopausal hot flashes in women progressing through the menopause transition. We 
hypothesized that associations of both somatic and affective dimensions of anxiety with hot 
flashes increased in the menopause transition, and that somatic anxiety was an independent risk 
factor for menopausal hot flashes.
Methods—Hot flashes, anxiety symptoms, hormone levels and other psychosocial variables were 
assessed annually for 14 years of follow-up. The 233 women were premenopausal at baseline and 
continued through one year or more after the final menstrual period. Anxiety dimensions were 
assessed with the Zung Anxiety Scale (ZAS), a validated measure of affective anxiety and somatic 
anxiety. Summed item scores were divided by the number of items rated, so that ranges of the two 
dimensions were comparable.
Results—Seventy-two percent of the sample reported moderate/severe hot flashes during the 14-
year interval. There was no significant interaction between anxiety dimensions and menopausal 
stages. However, when adjusted for menopausal stage, the magnitude of association between 
somatic anxiety and hot flashes dramatically increased (OR 3.03, 95% CI: 2.12, 4.32, P<0.001), 
while the association between affective anxiety and hot flashes increased to a lesser extent (OR 
1.27, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.57, P=0.024). Women with high levels of somatic anxiety (top third of the 
sample) had the greatest risk of hot flashes (P<0.001). When the anxiety dimensions were 
considered in combination, the additive effect of high affective anxiety symptoms was minimal, 
with no significant difference between the group with high affective/low somatic symptoms and 
the low symptom group in incident hot flashes at each menopausal stage (P=0.54). In multivariable

 analysis, somatic anxiety increased the risk of hot flashes more than 3 times (OR 3.13, 95% CI: 
2.16, 4.53, P<0.001), but affective anxiety was not significantly associated with hot flashes after 
adjustment for other study variables (OR 1.19, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.48, P=0.117). Time-lagged somatic 
anxiety scores significantly predicted hot flashes, with a 71% increase in risk (OR 1.71, 95% CI: 
1.21, 2.41, P=0.002). Time-lagged affective anxiety scores did not predict hot flashes, (OR 1.06, 
95% CI: 0.87, 1.31, P=0.58).
Conclusions—This study showed a strong predictive association of somatic anxiety with the 
risk of menopausal hot flashes. The temporal associations suggest that somatic anxiety is not 
simply a redundant measure of hot flashes but predicts the risk of menopausal hot flashes and may 
be a potential target in clinical management of perimenopausal women.

INTRODUCTION
Menopausal hot flashes are associated with biological changes of ovarian aging, as indicated 
by their associations with altered endogenous hormone levels1, 2 and alterations in 
thermoregulatory control mechanisms3, 4 and many women seek medical treatment to relieve 
their discomfort.5 However, the pathophysiology of menopausal hot flashes remains poorly 
understood, and apart from hormone therapy, which significantly relieves hot flashes, 
scientific information for the management of this common problem remains limited.6
There are many reports of anxiety as a risk factor for hot flashes, but its association is 
controversial.7–14 Conflicting findings are in part due to the varied manifestations of anxiety 
syndromes and disorders and to the nature of the somatic symptoms of anxiety, which are 
similar to somatic complaints of hot flashes, and the consequent difficulty of disentangling 
the two conditions.11, 14, 15 There is also little evidence to indicate whether anxiety is a 
precursor or a consequence of hot flashes, and whether anxiety influences perceptions of hot 
flashes or augments the event of hot flashes.12
While anxiety symptoms are part of everyday life, anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and 
are the most common mental disorders in the community.16 Moreover, anxiety disorders 
tend to have a chronic and persistent course, are frequently comorbid with other physical 
and mental disorders, and result in substantial impairment.16–18 Anxiety syndromes with 
shorter time periods can be as seriously impairing as syndromes that meet full criteria for 
generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).19 Anxiety appears to be a particular problem for 
women inasmuch as the risk of anxiety disorders in women is double that of men (22.6% 
versus 11.8%), and this risk extends throughout the reproductive years.18
Anxiety manifests in many ways, ranging from symptoms to fully-diagnosed disorders that 
include generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, phobias and post-traumatic 
stress disorder. All these conditions consist of anxiety symptoms but differ in the types of 
situations that induce the anxiety and associated thoughts. For example, a diagnosis of 
generalized anxiety disorder focuses on persistent and excessive worry, nervousness and

 inability to relax, while panic disorder involves repeated unexpected panic attacks that 
include fearfulness and physical symptoms such as shortness of breath, heart palpitations 
and fear of “going crazy.” Furthermore, anxiety syndromes or high levels of anxiety 
symptoms that do not meet diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder may nonetheless be 
clinically significant and diminish quality of life.20–22
The aim of this study was to identify temporal associations of anxiety and menopausal hot 
flashes, using a validated instrument to assess somatic and affective anxiety symptoms in 
women progressing through the menopause transition. We hypothesized an effect 
modification of menopausal stage on dimensions of somatic and affective anxiety, with 
increased associations in the menopause transition. Based on evidence in previous 
studies,8,11 we also hypothesized that somatic anxiety was an independent risk factor of 
menopausal hot flashes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study participants
The study sample included 233 women in the Penn Ovarian Aging Study (POAS) cohort. 
We included only participants who reached at least one year beyond natural menopause 
during the follow-up period (1996–2012) and reported no troublesome hot flashes at the first 
assessment, in order to clearly address the temporal association of anxiety with incident hot 
flashes in the menopause transition. The Institutional Review Board of the University of 
Pennsylvania approved the study, and all participants provided written informed consent.
The original cohort was randomly identified by telephone digit dialing in Philadelphia 
County, PA, with sampling stratified to obtain equal numbers of African American and white 
women as previously described.7 At enrollment, all women were premenopausal with 
regular menstrual cycles of 22–35 days for the previous three cycles, ages 35–47 years, had 
an intact uterus and at least one ovary. Exclusion criteria at enrollment included current use 
of any hormonal or psychotropic medications, alcohol or drug abuse, major psychiatric 
disorder in the past year, pregnancy or breast feeding, uncontrolled hypertension, and serious 
health problems known to compromise ovarian function. Attrition since POAS inception has 
been acceptable at 33% over 14 years (293/436). The attrition has been non-differential with 
respect to the sample characteristics, as reported in Nelson et al (23), and has not 
significantly differed by race or education. Attrition through Period 14 was classified as lost 
to follow-up (n=51), no reason given (n=40), withdrew consent (n=22), personal constraints 
or problems (n=16), and deceased (N=14).
Study design
Following cohort enrollment, full follow-up assessments were conducted for 14 years at 
intervals of approximately 9 months in the first five years and then annually, with a two-year 
gap between assessments 10 and 11. Study data were collected at two in-home visits timed 
to the menstrual cycle (days 2–6) in two consecutive menstrual cycles, or approximately one 
month apart in non-cycling women for 14 assessment periods. The study was described to 
participants as a general women’s health study. Trained research interviewers obtained

 menstrual dates, structured interview data on overall health, blood samples for hormone 
assays, and anthropometric measures. Participants completed a set of validated self-report 
measures to assess health and other behavioral measures of the study at each assessment 
period.
Study variables
The primary outcome variable was moderate or severe hot flashes as reported by participants 
at each follow-up assessment, using a menopausal symptom list that was validated for the 
cohort and embedded in the structured interview questionnaire.24 Participants were asked 
whether hot flashes or night sweats occurred in the past month, whether they occurred in the 
past year, and rated the severity for each time period as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 
(severe).
Anxiety was rated at each assessment using the Zung Anxiety Scale (ZAS), a validated 
measure that was constructed to measure anxiety symptoms as a clinical entity and included 
20 common symptoms of anxiety.25 The scale is based on a strong theoretical model and 
discriminates well between patients diagnosed with and without anxiety disorders.26 
Participants rated each item for its frequency in the past week, from none or a little (1), to 
most or all of the time (4). The rating scores were summed for each participant. Zung 
identified summed score ranges as indicating normal anxiety (20 to 35), minimal to 
moderate anxiety (36 to 47), marked to severe anxiety (48–59), and most severe anxiety (60–
80). The two subscales measure affective anxiety (items 1–5) and somatic anxiety (items 6–
20). We calculated the mean scores for each subscale (the summed item scores divided by 
the number of items rated), in order to provide comparable score ranges for interpretation of 
the affective and somatic anxiety dimensions. In each subscale, the top third was defined as 
the high symptom group; the lower two-thirds were defined as the low symptom group.
Menopausal stages were adapted from the Staging System for Reproductive Aging in 
Women27 as follows: premenopausal: regular menstrual cycles in the 22- to 35-day range; 
early transition: changes >=7 days in either direction in the participants’ own cycle length 
through 2 months (60 days) amenorrhea; late transition: 3 to 11 months amenorrhea; early 
postmenopause: final menstrual period (FMP) to <6 years post-FMP; late postmenopause: 
>=6 years post-FMP.
Covariates were selected for their associations with hot flashes in previous studies and the 
goals of this study. Time-varying covariates included body mass index (BMI >=30, <30), 
perceived stress,28 alcohol use >=1/week, current smoking, estradiol, follicle stimulating 
hormone (FSH), current age, employment (yes, no) and use of psychotropic medications in 
the follow-up interval (yes, no); fixed variables were history of depression (yes, no) as 
identified at cohort enrollment by medical history interview, race (African American or 
white) and education (>HS, <=HS).
Estradiol and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured by radioimmunoassay in 
the Translational Research Center of the University of Pennsylvania using Coat-A-Count 
commercial kits (Siemens). Non-fasting blood samples were collected at each study visit 
between days 2 and 6 of the menstrual cycle, or one month apart in non-cycling women,

 through assessment period 14, providing a possible maximum of 28 samples per woman. 
The blood samples were centrifuged and frozen in aliquots at −80C. Assays were conducted 
in batches that included four visits per participant to reduce the within-women variability 
resulting from assay conditions. All assays were performed in duplicate and repeated if 
values differed by greater than 15%. Inter-assay and intra-assay coefficients of variation 
were less than 5%.
Statistical analysis
The primary outcome variable was a dichotomous assessment of hot flash severity (moderate 
or severe versus mild or none), which was rated by the participants at each assessment 
period. The 233 participants provided 3,112 hot flash observations. All participants in this 
study were premenopausal at baseline and had observations for at least one year after the 
FMP.
Generalized linear mixed effects regression models for repeated measures were used to 
estimate unadjusted and adjusted associations of the study variables with moderate/severe 
hot flashes. The anxiety scores and hot flash severity were measured at each assessment 
period throughout the study. All available data were included in the analyses. Models were 
adjusted for menopausal stage, and all potentially time-varying covariates were treated as 
such in modeling. Variance estimates for the statistical tests on the regression coefficients 
were adjusted for repeated observations from each participant using generalized estimating 
equations.29 In all models, observations during hormone use, pregnancy and breast feeding 
were censored at the time of their occurrence. Women who had a hysterectomy prior to 
natural menopause were excluded in this report. To test the predictive values of the anxiety 
symptom dimensions, the models were rerun, with the somatic and affective anxiety scores 
lagged by one assessment period relative to each time of the hot flash reports. To test 
whether hot flash-type symptoms in the somatic anxiety dimension (facial flushing, heart 
pounding) accounted for the association between anxiety and hot flashes, the models were 
rerun, omitting these possible symptoms of hot flashes in the somatic subscale scores.
All covariates were defined a priori and evaluated for their unadjusted association with hot 
flashes. Covariates that were associated with hot flashes at P<=0.20 in unadjusted analysis 
were included in multivariable models to determine the independent contribution of the 
covariates to the outcome of hot flashes. Inclusion in the final multivariable models was 
guided by whether each variable remained statistically significant at P<0.05 or modified 
other significant associations by >=15%. Hypothesized interactions between the two anxiety 
subscales and menopausal stage were examined. Hormone covariates were modeled using 
natural log transformations to reduce the influence of skewed distributions. The subject 
mean of the two hormone measures obtained at each assessment period was used in analysis. 
Estradiol and FSH were evaluated in separate multivariable models due to their high inter-
correlation. Odds ratios for the hormones are presented per unit (1 standard deviation) 
change.
Statistical power calculations were computed using the sampclus program in STATA version 
14 (College Station, TX) to compare whether the women defined by high somatic (or 
affective) anxiety symptoms (33% of the sample) versus the remainder of the sample had an

 increased prevalence of moderate/severe hot flashes. Each woman contributed numerous 
visits prior to and following menopause. Based on assumptions of 2-sided tests with type 1, 
alpha, error of 5%, a mean of 8 repeated measures per participant, and a correlation among 
the repeated measures of 0.45, the study has 80% power to detect an increase in the 
likelihood (odds ratio) of moderate to severe hot flashes of 1.43 or greater.
Data analyses were conducted using the SAS 9.3 statistical package (SAS, Inc., Cary, NC). 
Statistical tests were two-sided, with P<=0.05 considered significant.
RESULTS
Sample description
Participants were fully evaluated for 14 years and contributed a mean of 13.4 observation 
points per participant. One-hundred-sixty-eight women in the study sample (72%) reported 
moderate or severe hot flashes during the 14-year interval. The average Zung anxiety score 
for the total sample at baseline was 34 (SD 7) (high normal range). Table 1 shows the 
sample characteristics at baseline for the affective and somatic dimensions of anxiety with 
each dimension divided into high and low symptom-level groups as defined above.
Anxiety symptoms in relation to menopausal hot flashes in unadjusted analysis
The total summed ZAS score was significantly associated with moderate/severe hot flashes 
over the 14-year follow-up, with the likelihood of association between anxiety and hot 
flashes increasing 2% with each point increase in the ZAS scores (OR 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01 – 
1.04, P=0.005). We then evaluated the two dimensions of the ZAS for their associations with 
hot flashes. The baseline mean score (the summed item scores divided by the number of 
items) was 1.68 (SD 0.35) for the somatic dimension and 1.74 (SD 0.54) for the affective 
dimension. The dimension of somatic anxiety was strongly associated with hot flashes over 
the follow-up interval, with the likelihood of hot flashes increasing 4% with each 1-point 
increase in mean scores (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.07, P<0.001). The dimension of affective 
anxiety was not significantly associated with hot flashes in unadjusted analysis (OR 1.01, 
95% CI: 0.96, 1.05, P=0.78).
Anxiety in relation to hot flashes adjusted for menopausal stage
There was no significant interaction between somatic anxiety or affective anxiety and 
menopausal stage, indicating that the patterns of association with hot flashes in the 
menopause transition were similar (interaction for somatic anxiety: P=0.83; interaction for 
affective anxiety: P=0.18). In models adjusted only for menopausal stage, the magnitude of 
the association between somatic anxiety and hot flashes dramatically increased in the 
follow-up interval (OR 3.03, 95% CI: 2.12, 4.32, P<0.001), while the association between 
affective anxiety and hot flashes increased to a lesser extent (OR 1.27, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.57, 
P=0.024). To test whether hot flash-type symptoms in the somatic anxiety dimension (facial 
flushing, heart pounding) accounted for the association between anxiety and hot flashes, we 
recalculated the somatic anxiety subscale, subtracting these 2 items. When the models were 
rerun, omitting these dual symptoms both singly and together, the associations between

 somatic anxiety and hot flashes remained significant (OR 2 20, 95% CI: 1.59, 3.06, P<0.001 
with both symptoms removed).
When each dimension of anxiety was divided into high and low symptom groups and 
considered in combination, the two groups with high somatic anxiety had the greatest risk of 
hot flashes compared to women with low anxiety symptoms and also had nearly identical 
reports of incident hot flashes at each stage in the menopause transition (Figure 1). Figure 1 
further shows that the additive effect of affective anxiety symptoms was minimal, inasmuch 
as the high affective anxiety group did not differ from the low affective group in reports of 
incident hot flashes. Furthermore, the group with high affective/low somatic symptoms did 
not differ from the group with low symptoms in the reports of incident hot flashes at each 
menopausal stage (P=0.54), again suggesting that the association of affective symptoms in 
relation to hot flashes was minimal.
Associations with covariates and hormone levels
Table 2 shows associations of the hypothesized covariates with hot flashes. Covariates with a 
significant unadjusted association with hot flashes included somatic anxiety, menopausal 
stage, current age, history of depression, body mass index, current psychotropic 
medications, education, log FSH and log estradiol.
In multivariable analysis, the association of somatic anxiety with hot flashes remained 
highly significant, with the risk of hot flashes increasing over 3 times with each point 
increase in the mean somatic anxiety score (OR 3.13, 95% CI: 2.16, 4.53, P<0.001). 
Menopausal stage (P<0.001) and current age (P<0.001) were independent contributors to hot 
flashes after adjusting for all other variables in the model. Current psychotropic medications 
were protective in the multivariable model, with a 59% lower risk of hot flashes, but 
importantly, did not confound the association between somatic anxiety and hot flashes (i.e., 
the association of somatic anxiety with hot flashes was nearly identical in models with and 
without medications). Although significantly associated with hot flashes in unadjusted 
analysis, the associations of estradiol and FSH were not significant in multivariable analysis 
(P=0.24 and P=0.06, respectively), due to the impact of menopausal stage, which had less 
variability and explained the same association with hot flashes.
Affective anxiety was not significantly associated with hot flashes in multivariable analysis 
(OR 1.19, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.48, P=0.117) (Table 2). The covariates of menopausal stage, 
current age, history of depression, and education were independent contributors to hot 
flashes in this model. A history of depression had an independent contribution to hot flashes 
when modeled with affective anxiety (P=0.023) but did not reach significance in the model 
with somatic anxiety (P=0.145). Higher education levels were protective, with a 36% lower 
risk of hot flashes. Current psychotropic medication had a significant association with hot 
flashes, but did not confound the association between somatic anxiety and hot flashes (i.e., 
the association of somatic anxiety with hot flashes was nearly identical in models with and 
without medications). Neither FSH nor estradiol were significantly associated with hot 
flashes when included in the model with affective anxiety (P=0.13 and P=0.16 respectively), 
due to the impact of menopausal stage.

 The covariate of BMI was significantly associated with hot flashes in unadjusted analysis 
but was not an independent contributor to hot flashes in the final multivariable models. Other 
hypothesized covariates of perceived stress, current smoking, alcohol use, employment and 
race were not significantly associated with hot flashes in either adjusted or unadjusted 
analysis in this study (data shown in Table 2).
Anxiety as a predictor of hot flashes
To address whether anxiety preceded hot flashes and could therefore be considered a 
predictor of the risk of menopausal hot flashes, the anxiety symptom scores adjusted for 
menopausal stage were lagged by one assessment period relative to each time of the hot 
flash reports to identify whether anxiety occurred before incident hot flashes. Lagged 
somatic anxiety scores significantly predicted risk of hot flashes, with a 69% increase in risk 
for each point increase in mean somatic anxiety scores (OR 1.69, 95% CI: 1.23, 2.32, 
P=0.001). When the somatic anxiety model was re-run with the possible dual symptoms 
(facial flushing and heart pounding items) removed from the somatic anxiety scores, the 
associations of somatic anxiety with hot flashes remained significant in time-lagged models 
(OR 1.50, 95% CI: 1.10, 2.05, P=0.011 with 2 items removed). In contrast, lagged affective 
anxiety scores did not predict hot flashes, a further indication of the weak association of 
affective anxiety with hot flashes (OR 1.06, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.31, P=0.58).
DISCUSSION
Anxiety, specifically the somatic symptom dimension, was strongly associated with hot 
flashes in the menopause transition in a 14-year follow-up interval. The association 
remained strong after adjusting for important factors known to be associated with hot flashes 
including age, menopausal stage, reproductive hormone levels, obesity, history of 
depression, education, race, perceived stress, alcohol use and smoking. Importantly, similar 
results persisted when we examined the association of somatic anxiety preceding reports of 
hot flashes, which suggested that somatic anxiety was not simply a redundant measure of hot 
flashes but significantly predicted the risk of moderate/severe hot flashes. Importantly, when 
possible dual symptoms were removed from the somatic anxiety scores, the time-lagged 
association between somatic anxiety and hot flashes remained.
In contrast, affective anxiety, which was characterized by anxiousness, apprehension and 
fearfulness and by definition was not sensitive to somatic symptoms, did not predict the risk 
of menopausal hot flashes. Although each dimension had similar average scores at baseline, 
and their patterns with hot flashes in the menopause transition were similar, only somatic 
anxiety strongly predicted the risk of hot flashes. While the association between affective 
anxiety and hot flashes increased modestly in the menopause transition, affective anxiety 
had no predictive association with incident hot flashes when the temporality of the 
association was considered.
These findings add information to several previous studies of anxiety in relation to 
menopausal hot flashes. In an earlier study of this cohort,7 women with moderate anxiety 
were nearly three times more likely to report hot flashes and women with high anxiety were 
nearly five times more likely to report hot flashes compared to women with anxiety scores in

 the normal range. Notably, anxiety preceded hot flashes, although interpretation was limited 
by the predominance of observations in the premenopause and early transition stages. In 
another study that assessed anxiety with the ZAS, somatic anxiety but not affective anxiety 
was significantly associated with hot flashes, as was found in the present study.11 However, 
the researchers interpreted the somatic anxiety symptoms as manifestations of hot flashes 
and were unable to evaluate whether anxiety symptoms preceded hot flashes, due to the 
cross-sectional design. In a study that evaluated anxiety as somatosensory amplification (the 
experience of sensing bodily sensations as intense, agitating, and unpleasant), the findings 
indicated that anxiety was significantly associated with hot flash interference and perceived 
control over hot flashes.30
Our predictive findings of association between somatic anxiety and moderate/severe hot 
flashes could also be interpreted as early subthreshold hot flashes/vasomotor symptoms that 
registered on the anxiety measure and were not anxiety symptoms. While it is possible that 
the women experienced sub-threshold vasomotor symptoms that they did not report as hot 
flashes, it is also possible that these dual symptoms were also symptoms of somatic anxiety, 
which amplified experiences of physical sensations such as hot flashes. When we tested the 
contribution of hot-flash type symptoms to the somatic anxiety score by omitting these 
symptoms from the scores, the associations between anxiety and hot flashes remained 
significant. These findings are consistent with concepts that somatic anxiety and other 
similar anxiety constructs such as anxiety sensitivity31 and somatosensory amplification30 
describe a trait-like cognitive condition where perceptions are linked with anxiety-related 
sensations or aversive physical sensations. We suggest that somatic anxiety is derived from a 
heightened apprehension of arousal symptoms in thermoregulation12 and links with the 
perceived severity and/or troublesomeness of hot flashes.
The selected covariates in this study were previously identified as risk factors for 
menopausal hot flashes in numerous studies. In this study, the significant independent risk 
factors of hot flashes in addition to menopausal stage and somatic anxiety included current 
age, a history of depression and education.. These diverse factors encompass social, 
behavioral and biological influences and add further support to considering hot flashes as 
not simply as a result of ovarian aging but as a multifactorial condition with important 
behavioral influences.
Clinical evaluation of women seeking treatment for hot flashes should include assessment of 
anxiety symptoms and consider various treatments for reducing anxiety as potentially 
beneficial in reducing hot flashes. Given the strong association between hot flashes and 
somatic anxiety, which reflects a trait-like cognitive condition, cognitive-behavioral therapy 
(CBT), which reduced anxiety sensitivity compared to control conditions in a meta-analysis 
of CBT, may be an important treatment to consider, although more studies are needed to 
confirm current information.41 The strong association between anxiety and hot flashes may 
also partly explain why selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which are indicated for 
treatment of anxiety, have shown modest efficacy for hot flashes32–36 and are considered a 
possible alternative to hormone therapy.37 Gabapentin is another medication that has been 
shown to reduce both hot flashes and anxiety symptoms and may provide therapeutic 
benefit,38–40 although confirmatory studies are needed for these preliminary findings. Non-

 pharmacological treatments that specifically target anxiety sensitivity might reduce the 
severity of hot flashes without the side effects of hormone and pharmacologic treatments. 
Exercise training resulted in clinically significant changes in anxiety sensitivity and 
improved panic disorder and GAD, but well-designed trials to confirm efficacy for hot 
flashes are needed.42, 43
Several limitations of the study are noted. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using a 
validated and widely-published self-report questionnaire that measured affective and somatic 
dimensions of anxiety. It is underscored that other measures of anxiety may yield different 
results, due to the heterogeneity of anxiety disorders and scale-specific metrics.25 Anxiety as 
measured in this study indicated that most participants had normal to moderate levels of 
anxiety, and only 5% had severe anxiety levels; studies of women with diagnosed anxiety 
disorders might provide further clarification of the role of anxiety in the subjective 
experience of hot flashes. Women who had surgical menopause and current users of 
hormone therapy were not included in the study, and further studies that evaluate these 
conditions are needed. Although we examined several important biological, behavioral and 
demographic variables associated with hot flashes, many factors beyond the scope of this 
study, such as physical activity, food consumption and negative life events, may be important 
to evaluate in other studies. While the sample had multiple assessments throughout the 
menopause transition with an acceptable attrition rate that was non-differential with respect 
to the sample characteristics, undetected bias due to loss to follow-up is possible. Finally, 
our findings are based on a population-based cohort of African-American and white urban 
women who were in general good health with no current hormone use and may not be 
generalizable to all perimenopausal women.
The primary strengths of this report are the 14-year follow-up, with annual evaluations using 
validated measures. The women were followed from premenopausal status through one or 
more years after the final menstrual period, which provided identification of menopause and 
the menopause transition with minimal recall bias. All study participants reported no 
troublesome hot flashes at baseline, which enabled clear identification of incident hot flashes 
in the menopause transition. The population-based sample was randomly identified and 
stratified to have similar numbers of African-American and white women for analysis of 
racial associations. Hormone measures were obtained concurrently with the study 
questionnaires and were collected in the early follicular phase in menstruating women to 
provide consistent timing of the assessments in relation to the menstrual cycle.
CONCLUSIONS
This study showed a strong predictive association of somatic anxiety with the risk of 
menopausal hot flashes. Although anxiety and hot flashes have dual symptoms that apply to 
both conditions, the temporal associations suggest that somatic anxiety is not simply a 
redundant measure of hot flashes but significantly predicts the risk of hot flashes and may be 
a potential target for treatment. Additional studies are needed to determine whether 
treatments that target somatic anxiety effectively reduce menopausal hot flashes.

1. Somatic dimension = S; affective dimension = A. In each dimension, the top third of scores defined the high symptom group; the lower two-thirds defined the low symptom group.
2. Scores indicating anxiety status as defined by Zung are normal (20–35), moderate 36–47, severe (48–59) very severe (60–80).
3. Mean score for community-based adult females is 25.6 (SD 8.2).
4. The standard cut point for high depressive symptoms is >=16.
5. Any slight differences in percents are due to missing data.
