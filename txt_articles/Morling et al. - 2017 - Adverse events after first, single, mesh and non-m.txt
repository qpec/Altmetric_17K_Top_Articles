Abstract  
Background 
Concerns have been raised about the safety of surgery for stress urinary incontinence 
(incontinence) and pelvic organ prolapse (prolapse) using transvaginal mesh. We assessed 
adverse outcomes following first, single mesh and comparable non-mesh procedures. 
Methods 
Women in Scotland aged ≥ 20 years undergoing a first, single incontinence or prolapse 
procedure during 1997/98-2015/16 were identified from a national hospitalisation database. 
Primary outcomes were immediate postoperative complications and subsequent (within 5 years) 
readmissions for later postoperative complications, further incontinence surgery, or further 
prolapse surgery. Poisson regression models were used to compare outcomes following 
procedures carried out with and without mesh. 
Findings 
16660 women underwent a first single incontinence procedure, 13133 (78·8%) using mesh. 
Compared to non-mesh open surgery (colposuspension), mesh procedures had a lower risk of 
immediate complications (adjusted rate ratio [aRR] 0·44 (0·36- 0·55)) and subsequent prolapse 
surgery (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 0·30 (0·24-0·39)), and a similar risk of further 
incontinence surgery (aIRR 0·90 (0·73-1·11)) and later complications (aIRR 1·12 (0·98-1·27)) - all 
ratios for retropubic mesh.  
18986 women underwent a first single prolapse procedure, 1279 (6·7%) using mesh. Mesh 
(compared to non-mesh) repair of anterior compartment prolapse was associated with a similar 
risk of immediate complications (aRR 0·93 (0·49- 1·79)); an increased risk of both further 
incontinence and prolapse surgery (aIRR 3·20 (2·06-4·96) and aIRR 1·69 (1·29-2·20) respectively); 
and a substantially increased risk of later complications (aIRR 3·15 (2·46-4·04)). Mesh (compared 
to non-mesh) repair of posterior compartment prolapse was associated with a similarly increased 
risk of repeat prolapse surgery and later complications. No difference in any outcome was 
observed between vaginal and, separately, abdominal mesh repair of vaginal vault prolapse 
compared to vaginal non mesh repair.

Interpretation 
Mesh procedures for incontinence are associated with a lower risk of immediate complications 
and subsequent prolapse surgery than open colposuspension, the main alternative procedure. 
Mesh procedures are as effective as colposuspension (in terms of the risk of repeat incontinence 
surgery). Additionally, mesh procedures carry a similar risk of later complications, at least up to 
five years post surgery. These results therefore support the use of mesh procedures for 
incontinence, although further research on longer term outcomes would be beneficial. 
Mesh procedures for anterior and posterior compartment prolapse (when performed as an 
isolated, first repair) are associated with poorer overall effectiveness and substantially increased 
later complications compared to similar non-mesh repairs.  These procedures cannot be 
recommended for primary prolapse repair. 
Both vaginal and abdominal mesh procedures for vaginal vault prolapse repair are associated 
with similar effectiveness and complication rates compared to non mesh vaginal repair.  These 
results therefore do not clearly favour any particular vault repair procedure.

Introduction 
Female stress urinary incontinence (incontinence) and pelvic organ prolapse (prolapse) are 
common conditions causing substantial disability.(1,2) Women’s lifetime risk (by age 80 years) of 
undergoing pelvic floor surgery for incontinence or prolapse has been estimated as 1 in 8 in the 
UK(3) and between 1 in 9(4) and, more recently, 1 in 5(5) in the US. Surgical repair for 
incontinence and prolapse has traditionally been performed using native tissue. However, over 
the past two decades alternative procedures involving the transvaginal placement of synthetic 
mesh tapes and implants have been developed for incontinence and prolapse respectively, as 
these were believed to be potentially less invasive, safer and/or more effective.  
During the 1990s in the US and 2000s in the UK mesh tape procedures for incontinence were 
rapidly adopted,(6) due to perceived equivalent efficacy to open surgical approaches with the 
benefit of a minimally-invasive approach and cost savings.(7) Mesh tape procedures initially 
used a retropubic approach: transobturator approach procedures were subsequently developed 
in an attempt to reduce the risk of intraoperative bladder damage.(8) Transvaginal mesh implant 
procedures for prolapse were developed to reduce the high risk of prolapse recurrence following 
native tissue repairs,(9) and their use has gradually increased over the past decade.(10)  
Despite a number of randomised controlled trials investigating the use of mesh in female 
incontinence and prolapse surgery, there is a lack of evidence on outcomes in routine practice, 
particularly long term outcomes.(7,11,12) Transvaginal mesh surgery, particularly for prolapse, 
is currently controversial.  Patient advocacy groups have raised concerns about poor long term 
outcomes.  Litigation brought by women who have experienced serious complications following 
mesh surgery is underway in many countries involving settled claims for over a billion US 
dollars and forcing manufacturers to withdraw mesh products or close down.(13-15) Enquiries 
into mesh surgery by the Scottish Government(16) and by NHS England(17) are ongoing. Several 
organisations have recently expressed reservations about transvaginal mesh surgery, in 
particular for prolapse,(18-21) although mesh surgery continues to be provided in many 
settings.(22) Procedures involving the transabdominal placement of mesh for uterine or vaginal 
vault prolapse have been available for many years and are less controversial than newer 
transvaginal mesh prolapse procedures. 
We therefore aimed to compare long term effectiveness and complication rates following 
procedures with and without mesh for all first, single incontinence and prolapse operations 
  
6 
carried out in Scotland between 1997 and 2016, using a national healthcare utilisation database 
with complete population coverage. 
Methods 
Sampling and datasets 
Data were extracted for all women aged ≥20 years undergoing incontinence and prolapse 
procedures during the period 1 April 1997 to 31 March 2016 from the Scottish hospital discharge 
dataset (SMR01) held by the Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS National Services 
Scotland.  
Index procedures 
Index procedures were restricted to first, single procedures. Combination procedures (i.e. an 
included procedure done at the same time as another incontinence or prolapse procedure) were 
excluded as were any procedures if the woman had undergone any incontinence or prolapse 
procedure in the preceding 5 years. Only the first index procedure performed during the study 
period was included for any individual woman. 
The only exceptions were for mesh and non-mesh vaginal vault prolapse procedures (see below). 
These procedures inevitably follow prior hysterectomy hence women with prior hysterectomy 
were included. In addition these procedures are very rarely done as single procedures hence 
procedures done at the same time as non-mesh anterior and/or posterior colporrhaphy were 
included. 
Index incontinence procedures were defined using the Office of Population Censuses and 
Surveys Classification of Interventions and Procedures 4th revision (OPCS-4) classification 
system and grouped as: open colposuspension (non-mesh); urethral injection therapy (non-
mesh); traditional suprapubic sling (non-mesh); unspecified mesh tapes (up to end March 2006); 
retropubic mesh tapes; and transobturator mesh tapes (both from April 2006 when specific codes 
became available) (Extra-Supplementary Material [ESM] 1). 
Index prolapse procedures were defined using OPCS-4 as: anterior colporrhaphy with and 
without mesh for anterior compartment repair; posterior colporrhaphy with and without mesh 
for posterior compartment repair; sacrospinous fixation of the vagina (non-mesh), vaginal mesh 
  
7 
vault repair (mesh), and open sacrocolpopexy (abdominal mesh) for repair of vaginal vault 
prolapse; and vaginal hysterectomy (non-mesh) for repair of uterine prolapse. 
Only colposuspensions and sacrocolpopexies done as open abdominal procedures were 
included: the small number of laparoscopic procedures provided in Scotland over the period of 
our analysis were excluded (ESM 1). Only vaginal hysterectomies done specifically for prolapse 
(as indicated by the diagnostic code recorded on the patient’s hospital discharge record) were 
included in our analysis (ESM 1). Note that in Scotland it is routine clinical practice for surgeons 
performing a vaginal hysterectomy for uterine prolapse to perform some element of 
reconstruction (suspension of the vaginal vault) following uterine removal. This is generally not 
coded as a separate concurrent procedure as it is considered to be a standard component of the 
primary hysterectomy. Additional procedures (e.g. colpocleisis, sacrohysteropexy, vaginal mesh 
uterine suspension) were considered for inclusion but rejected as insufficient numbers were 
performed during the study period (Figure 1). 
Outcomes 
Outcomes were defined as follows: 
Immediate (within the index admission record) and late procedural complications (within 
records of readmissions subsequent to the index admission and within 5 years) were identified 
via International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th revision 
(ICD-10) and OPCS-4 codes on hospital discharge records. Multiple complications within a 
single admission were counted as one complication, with multiple (re)admissions counted 
separately. Codes for complications included those for haemorrhage, relevant infections, pain, 
direct procedure related adverse events such as bladder perforation and urinary difficulties, and 
repeat surgery for mesh removal, with some specific codes only included in immediate or late 
complications as clinically appropriate (ESM 2). 
Further surgery for incontinence or prolapse was similarly identified via OPCS-4 and ICD-10 
codes from hospital discharge records within 5 years of the index admission with multiple 
readmissions for further surgery counted separately. Further incontinence surgery following an 
index incontinence procedure indicates failure of the initial procedure and hence provides a 
measure of procedure effectiveness. Conversely, further prolapse surgery following an index 
incontinence procedure can be considered as an additional late complication (and vice verse for 
index prolapse procedures). Full code lists for all outcomes are available in ESM2. 
  
8 
Covariates 
The following covariates were extracted from the hospital discharge database: age at index 
procedure admission; Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) rank, an area-based 
measure of material deprivation, derived from the postcode of residence at index admission and 
grouped into quintiles;(23) co-morbidity status, based on any of diabetes (ICD-9/10 codes 250, 
E10-E14), ischaemic heart disease (410-414, I20-I25) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(490-492, 496, J40-J44) recorded on the index hospital discharge record or records within the 5 
years prior to the index record. Surgeon volume was based on the annual number of 
incontinence and, separately, included prolapse procedures performed by the consultant 
responsible for the index procedure. Incontinence/prolapse index procedures were categorised as 
performed by a low volume surgeon if the consultant was responsible for <20 included 
incontinence/prolapse procedures in that year.(24) National designations were used to categorise 
the index admission hospital as teaching; large general; general; community or other.(25)  
Validation of index procedure and complication codes 
The PROSPECT clinical trial, which recruited between 2010 and 2013, is comparing outcomes 
following mesh and non-mesh repair of anterior and posterior compartment prolapse.(26) Thirty 
three women in the trial had an index mesh procedure in a Scottish hospital and were known to 
have experienced subsequent mesh erosion complications by April 2015. Using these women as a 
validation dataset, we validated the OPCS-4 and ICD-10 codes recorded on the SMR01 records 
relating to their index procedure and subsequent admissions for repair of mesh erosion.  
Eleven of the women underwent single anterior or posterior mesh colporrhaphy (included in this 
study) as their index procedure and all were correctly coded on the corresponding SMR01 
record.  The remaining 22 women underwent a combination index procedure (excluded from 
this study), of which 11 were fully correctly coded. The women underwent a total of 24 
subsequent mesh erosion repair procedures as a day case or inpatient: the remainder were 
managed as outpatients.  Twenty three of the anticipated 24 SMR01 records were identified. 
Twenty two of the 23 records included OPCS-4 and/or ICD-10 codes used in this study to 
identify late complications.

Analysis 
Summary statistics for baseline characteristics and adverse outcomes were reported by 
procedure type and a visual inspection of the data made. Length of stay in days for each index 
procedure was reported as median and interquartile range. 
Poisson regression was used to estimate the crude and adjusted rate ratio (denoted RR and aRR 
respectively) of all outcomes. For late procedural complications and repeat surgery, multiple 
events were allowed. Follow-up was censored at 5 years following the index procedure or at 31st 
March 2016. Covariates were selected for inclusion in the regression models if they were 
identified by the project steering committee as potential confounders (see ESM 3 for causal 
diagram). For immediate complications all counts occurred in the same period. For other 
complications an offset term was used to allow for differential follow-up periods. 
Outcomes for each procedure were compared to those following a non-mesh reference 
procedure. For incontinence procedures, the non-mesh reference category was open 
colposuspension. Additionally, pre-specified subgroup analyses were undertaken to compare 
transobturator mesh procedures to retropubic mesh procedures for the period 2006/07 onwards 
(when procedure specific coding became available). 
For prolapse procedures, the non-mesh reference category was anterior colporrhaphy. 
Additionally, subgroup analyses were undertaken to compare mesh to similar non-mesh 
procedures for anterior compartment repair (anterior colporrhaphy with and without mesh, 
2007/08 onwards); posterior compartment repair (posterior colporrhaphy with and without 
mesh, 2007/08 onwards); and vault prolapse repair (vaginal mesh vault repair with mesh and, 
separately, open sacrocolpopexy with abdominal mesh versus sacrospinous fixation of the 
vagina without mesh from 2006/07 onwards). Further prolapse surgery following an index 
prolapse procedure was analysed overall and (for all index procedure types excluding vaginal 
hysterectomy) according to whether the repeat procedure was on the same or a different 
anatomical compartment to the index procedure.  Vaginal hysterectomy was excluded from this 
analysis as uterine prolapse cannot recur once the uterus has been removed. 
In sensitivity analyses, readmissions for further incontinence and/or prolapse surgery were 
analysed as a single composite outcome, as were readmissions for any further surgery and/or 
late complications to assess the level of double counting between outcome categories. In 
addition, the possible effect of consultant level clustering was examined in general estimating 
  
10 
models with a log-link, Poisson distribution and exchangeable correlation structure.  Final 
sensitivity analyses (covering procedures from 2006/07 onwards only because of data 
availability) examined the effect of restricting index procedures to those with no previous 
incontinence or prolapse surgery in the 15 (rather than 5) years prior to the index procedure to 
ensure more complete exclusion of repeat procedures. 
Ethical approvals were obtained from the local Caldicott Guardian and the Scottish Privacy 
Advisory Committee.  
Data were analysed using SPSS v21.0 (SPSS Inc, Illinois, USA) and R (Vienna Austria 3.2.0).

Results 
Of 26 885 incontinence and 77 537 prolapse procedures carried out in Scotland between 1997/98 
and 2015/16, 16 660 (62.0%) and 18 986 (24.5%) respectively were first single included procedures 
included in our main analysis (Figure 1). Characteristics of women undergoing first single 
included procedures are shown in Table 1. Characteristics of women undergoing first combined 
procedures (excluded from our main analysis) are shown for comparison in ESM4. Of the 16 660 
incontinence and 18 986 prolapse procedures, 1 and 3 respectively were excluded from the 
multivariable analysis due to the patient dying on the day of surgery and a further 73 and 98 
respectively were excluded due to missing data on area deprivation status (Figure 1). Trends in 
the provision of each included procedure are shown in Figure 2 and ESM5. Information on 
inpatient length of stay for each included procedure is provided in ESM6. 
Incontinence procedures 
Compared to women undergoing non-mesh open colposuspension, patients undergoing mesh 
procedures for incontinence were of similar age, were less likely to live in a deprived area, and 
had similar levels of co-morbidity. Women undergoing mesh procedures were less likely to have 
their procedure in a teaching hospital or to have their procedure performed by a consultant with 
low procedure volume (Table 1). 
Immediate complications following incontinence surgery 
Overall 815 (4·9%) women had an immediate procedural complication. After adjusting for age, 
deprivation, co-morbidity, hospital type and consultant volume, women undergoing retropubic 
and transobturator mesh procedures had a substantially lower risk of immediate complications 
than those undergoing the reference non-mesh procedure (open colposuspension), (aRR 0·44 
(0·36- 0·55) and 0·31 (0·24- 0·40) respectively, Table 2a). Within the mesh group, transobturator 
procedures were associated with fewer immediate complications than retropubic procedures 
(Table 3a). Subgroups of immediate complications are summarised in ESM7. Model fit statistics 
for all results are provided in ESM8 and ESM9. 
  
12 
Late complications following incontinence surgery 
There were 2 771 hospital readmissions for late procedural complications over 75 436 person-
years (36·7/1000 person-years). Both retropubic and transobturator mesh procedures had a 
similar risk of late complications to colposuspension (Table 2b). There was no difference in the 
rate of late procedural complications between transobturator and retropubic mesh procedures 
(Table 3b). Subgroups of late complications are summarised in ESM7. In general most immediate 
and later complications were infection or directly procedure related (e.g. organ damage, urinary 
difficulties). In addition, in patients who had mesh index incontinence surgery, around a third of 
late complication readmissions contained a code indicating a subsequent mesh removal 
procedure. 
Further surgery following incontinence surgery 
Compared with non-mesh open colposuspension, mesh surgery was associated with a similar 
risk of subsequent incontinence surgery (Table 2c and 3c). Mesh surgery using both retropubic 
and transobturator methods was associated with a substantially lower risk of subsequent 
prolapse surgery however (aIRR 0·30 (0·24-0·39) and 0·26 (0·20-0·34) respectively) (Table 2d and 
3d). 
Prolapse procedures 
The characteristics of women undergoing first, single, included prolapse procedures during the 
study period are shown in Table 1. 
  
13 
Immediate complications following prolapse surgery 
Overall 799 (4·2%) women had an immediate procedural complication following prolapse 
surgery. The crude and adjusted risks of immediate complications following each procedure 
type compared to the reference non-mesh procedure (anterior colporrhaphy) are shown in Table 
4a. For women undergoing repair of specific compartments, there was no significant difference 
in risk of immediate complications following a mesh compared to a non mesh repair (Table 5a). 
Subgroups of immediate complications are summarised in ESM7. 
Late procedural complications following prolapse surgery 
There were 2 186 late procedural complications over 80 309 person-years (27·2 /1000 person 
years). In general late complication rates were higher following vault prolapse repair than 
standard anterior repair (Table 4b). Mesh procedures for anterior and posterior compartment 
prolapse had much higher late complication rates than corresponding non-mesh procedures on 
the same compartment (aRR 3·15 (2·46-4·04) and 2.76 (2·11-3·61) respectively, Table 5b). There 
was no significant difference in the rate of late procedural complications following vaginal or 
abdominal mesh repair for vault prolapse compared to non mesh vaginal vault repair (Table 5b). 
Subgroups of late procedural complications are summarised in ESM7. In general most 
immediate and later complications were infection or directly procedure related. In addition, in 
patients who had mesh index prolapse surgery, up to around a half of all late complication 
readmissions contained a code indicating a subsequent mesh removal procedure. 
Further surgery following prolapse surgery 
Anterior colporrhaphy with mesh was associated with a higher risk of subsequent incontinence 
and prolapse surgery than anterior colporrhaphy without mesh.  Posterior colporrhaphy with 
mesh was associated with a higher risk of subsequent prolapse surgery than posterior 
colporrhaphy without mesh.  Subsequent incontinence and prolapse surgery rates were similar 
following vaginal and, separately, abdominal mesh repair for vault prolapse compared to non 
mesh vaginal vault repair (Table 5c and 5d). For patients undergoing repeat prolapse surgery, 
around one third of subsequent procedures were performed on the same compartment as the 
original surgery and two thirds were performed on a different or unspecified compartment 
(ESM10). Index anterior and posterior compartment repair was associated with an increased risk 
of further prolapse surgery on the same and different compartments, though the rate ratios for 
  
14 
reoperation on the same compartment were imprecisely estimated due to relatively small 
numbers of outcomes observed (ESM11). 
Sensitivity analyses 
Results when readmissions for incontinence and/or prolapse surgery, and readmissions for any 
further surgery and/or late complications, were analysed as single composite outcomes, 
indicated minimal double counting between categories. Performing the analyses using 
generalized estimating equation models accounting for clustering by consultant (ESM 12), and 
limiting the analyses to index procedures from 2006/07 onwards with no prior incontinence or 
prolapse procedure within the preceding 15 rather than 5 years, also yielded similar results (ESM 
13-16). 
Discussion 
We report the first large-scale robust observational study of outcomes following surgical 
management of both incontinence and prolapse.  We used high quality administrative data with 
complete population coverage to examine long term (up to five years) effectiveness and 
complications following specific mesh and comparable non-mesh procedures. 
For stress urinary incontinence we found that in routine clinical practice mesh surgery was 
associated with a lower risk of immediate complications and subsequent prolapse surgery than 
the main alternative non-mesh open surgical procedure (colposuspension), and a similar risk of 
later complications and further incontinence surgery. 
For prolapse we found that use of mesh in repair of anterior and posterior compartment 
prolapse was associated with both increased risk of complications and lower effectiveness. For 
example, anterior colporrhaphy with mesh was associated with a similar risk of immediate 
complications but a higher risk of later complications, subsequent incontinence surgery, and 
subsequent prolapse surgery compared to anterior colporrhaphy without mesh. 
For patients undergoing repair of vaginal vault prolapse, we found no difference in any outcome 
(complications or further surgery) following vaginal mesh or, separately, abdominal mesh 
surgery compared to non mesh vaginal repair. 
  
15 
Strengths 
This is the first study of incontinence and prolapse surgery to compare clinically relevant 
outcomes in routine clinical practice in a national study with complete population coverage, 
comparing mesh procedures with their corresponding non-mesh equivalents. It included large 
numbers of procedures provided over an extended period and examined outcomes up to 5 years 
following index surgery.  We used high quality national datasets containing records of all 
routine NHS inpatient and day case care performed during the study period, and linked records 
belonging to individual patients across time using NHS Scotland’s unique patient identifier.(27) 
We performed a range of sensitivity analyses which provided further support to our findings. 
Limitations 
As with all observational comparisons of treatment groups, confounding by indication is a 
possible explanation for our findings. It is plausible, for prolapse surgery in particular, that 
women with more severe disease were selected for mesh rather than non-mesh procedures.  
However, the women undergoing mesh procedures were similar in terms of age, deprivation, 
and comorbidity to those receiving non-mesh procedures (factors which we would except to be 
associated with worse post-operative outcomes). Moreover, confounding by indication is an 
unlikely explanation for the differential effect of mesh on immediate compared to late 
complications. 
Our results are limited to women undergoing first, single incontinence or prolapse procedures.  
Prolapse frequently affects multiple anatomical compartments, and/or is accompanied by overt 
or occult incontinence.  In addition, prolapse repair failure rates are relatively high leading to 
many women requiring repeat procedures.  As a result, a relatively high proportion of the total 
volume of prolapse surgery carried out in Scotland involves multiple and/or repeat procedures 
and as such was excluded from our analysis.  Our approach of focusing on first, single 
procedures allows clear comparisons of the outcomes seen after specific procedures however it 
means that we cannot directly comment on the outcomes of women undergoing multiple and/or 
repeat procedures.  We would note however, that robust information on outcomes following 
specific procedures is likely to provide useful guidance for clinicians and patients considering 
appropriate procedures for women with prolapse affecting multiple compartments, in particular 
given the lack of other specific evidence on outcomes for these more complex groups. 
  
16 
Vaginal hysterectomy is not a reconstructive procedure and it can be performed for a range of 
indications including uterine prolapse. In recognition of this, we limited our analysis to vaginal 
hysterectomies recorded as done specifically for prolapse. In addition, we note that in Scotland it 
is routine clinical practice for surgeons performing a vaginal hysterectomy for uterine prolapse 
to perform some element of reconstruction (suspension of the vaginal vault) following uterine 
removal as an integral part of the procedure. We were unable to include some procedure types of 
interest in our analysis, in particular laparoscopic colposuspension, laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy, 
and mesh uterine suspension procedures, due to insufficient numbers of first, single procedures 
being performed in Scotland over our analysis period. We are therefore unable to comment on 
the outcomes of these procedures. 
We were restricted in our ability to check the accuracy of coding for procedures and 
complications. However, the quality of Scottish hospital discharge records is generally high(28) 
and we undertook additional validation of the coding of index mesh prolapse procedures and 
their complications. This provided reassurance that the single procedures included in this study 
were highly likely to be correctly coded.  In addition the extensive code lists used to identify 
subsequent readmissions for late complications were highly likely to pick up admissions relating 
to important complications such as mesh erosion. 
Our classification of index procedure types was limited by the detail available within the OPCS4 
coding system. This generally allows identification of specific types of index procedure, but not 
precise subgroups of procedures involving particular surgical techniques or particular types of 
mesh. For example, the available OPCS4 codes allowed us to distinguish retropubic and 
transobturator mesh incontinence procedures from 2006/07 onwards, but not procedure 
subtypes.  Separate procedure codes for ‘up-down’ versus ‘down-up’ retropubic mesh insertion, 
or ‘inside-out’ versus ‘outside-in’ transobturator mesh insertion, are not available. 
Our choice of primary outcomes focussed on diagnoses and procedures severe enough to require 
hospital (re)admission. Whilst detailed information is available for inpatient care, national level 
data on outpatient and community based care is sparser.  It was therefore not possible to capture 
complications managed in outpatient or primary care settings, an issue other studies have also 
struggled to address.(29) 
We developed an inclusive code list designed to capture all immediate and later complications. 
However coded data inevitably carries limited clinical detail so it was not possible to comment 
  
17 
on the severity of complications or their impact on patients’ quality of life. Also, it was not 
possible to ensure that outcomes such as complication readmissions were a direct consequence 
of the index procedure of interest and not related to an alternative event. It should also be noted 
that whilst we used reoperation rates as an indication of effectiveness of the index procedure, 
this gives only a partial view of effectiveness as many factors in addition to the severity of 
persistent/recurrent symptoms may influence whether women undergo repeat surgery or not. 
Some women may choose more conservative treatment such as pelvic floor muscle training, 
which would not be captured by our methods.  Additionally, further incontinence surgery 
following index prolapse surgery may reflect unmasking of occult incontinence following the 
initial anatomical repair which arguably may not be viewed as a complication. 
Our initial ‘look-back’ period of 5 years to define ‘first’ procedures is relatively short.  Sensitivity 
analysis involving an extended 15 year look-back suggested that a number of women in our 
cohorts had in fact had previous incontinence or prolapse surgery more than 5 years before their 
index procedure, so a number of repeat procedures will be included in the main analyses.  The 
sensitivity analysis provided reassurance however that stricter exclusion of repeat procedures 
does not materially alter our results. 
In general mesh procedures were carried out in the more recent years of the study period.  If 
there were strong secular trends in the general risk of surgical complications this would 
influence the comparison of mesh and non-mesh procedures. However it is likely that 
background surgical risk has decreased over time, which would tend to conservatively bias 
results towards showing lower risk for the more recently provided mesh procedures. 
Interpretation in light of other evidence 
Multiple trials on the short term outcomes following surgery for incontinence are 
available.(11,30-32) Trial results reporting lower risk of perioperative complications and 
subsequent development of prolapse following mesh surgery compared to non-mesh open 
surgical procedures are supported by our findings. Trial evidence that mesh and open surgical 
procedures have similar effectiveness over the short term is also supported by our results, and 
we provide new evidence that this comparable effectiveness is maintained over the longer term. 
Our finding of similar levels of later postoperative complications following mesh and open 
surgery for incontinence is reassuring, however we note that around a third of readmissions for 
later complications following mesh incontinence surgery involve mesh removal.(29)

Currently available trials on surgical management of prolapse are generally small, of moderate 
quality at best, and provide information on short term outcomes only.(12,33) The available trial 
evidence suggests that vaginal mesh surgery for prolapse of the anterior compartment is more 
effective (in terms of objective repair of the compartment operated on) over the short term than 
similar non-mesh surgery, but is associated with a higher risk of subsequent development of 
prolapse of other compartments and/or incontinence. Contrary to the available trials, we find no 
evidence that mesh surgery for anterior or posterior compartment prolapse provided in routine 
clinical practice is more effective than non-mesh surgery over the longer term. Rather, we find 
that mesh surgery is associated with an overall increased need for repeat prolapse surgery. There 
was an increased risk of further surgery on the same compartment as the index procedure 
(though the confidence interval was wide) and of further surgery on a different compartment. 
Trial evidence also suggests that up to 10% of women experience mesh erosion through the 
vaginal mucosa following vaginal mesh surgery for anterior compartment prolapse. Our finding 
of the substantially higher risk of complications (and high proportion of complication 
readmissions involving mesh revision/removal) following mesh prolapse surgery is novel but in 
line with the evidence on mesh erosion rates. 
Vaginal vault prolapse repair can involve mesh placement through the transvaginal (vaginal 
mesh vault repair) or abdominal (open sacrocolpopexy) routes. It is recognised clinically that the 
risks and benefits of abdominally compared to vaginally inserted mesh may be different.(21) 
However, in our analysis, we found no evidence that any outcomes following abdominal or 
vaginal mesh vault repair were better or worse than non-mesh vault repair (sacrospinous 
fixation of vagina), although confidence intervals were wide, reflecting the fact that both mesh 
vault procedures are relatively uncommonly performed (at least as first, single procedures) in 
Scotland. 
Existing high quality observational evidence of outcomes following mesh and non-mesh 
prolapse surgery is very sparse. Welk(29) and Kelly(34) examined the incidence of repeat surgery 
for mesh complications/erosions following mesh surgery for incontinence and prolapse 
respectively using routinely available healthcare data on Ontario. The cumulative repeat surgery 
rate was found to be 3% and 5% by 10 years after index incontinence and prolapse procedures 
respectively. No information on other outcomes or comparison to non mesh surgery was 
provided. Chughtai examined short term outcomes following mesh and non-mesh vaginal 
  
19 
surgery for prolapse provided between 2008-2011 in New York State using routinely available 
healthcare data.(35) Women undergoing any mesh surgery (all procedure types considered 
together) were found to have a higher rate of reoperation for prolapse repair or mesh revision 
(both outcomes considered together) over the 12 months following surgery than those 
undergoing any non-mesh procedure. Our findings are in line with Chughtai’s and substantially 
extend the available observational evidence by providing information on specific procedures and 
outcomes over a longer period of follow up. 
Conclusion 
Mesh procedures for incontinence are associated with a lower risk of immediate complications 
and subsequent prolapse surgery than open colposuspension, the main alternative procedure. 
Mesh procedures are as effective as colposuspension (in terms of the risk of repeat incontinence 
surgery). Additionally, mesh procedures carry a similar risk of later complications, at least up to 
five years post surgery. These results therefore support the use of mesh procedures for 
incontinence, although further research on longer term outcomes would be beneficial. 
Mesh procedures for anterior and posterior compartment prolapse (when performed as an 
isolated, first repair) are associated with poorer overall effectiveness and substantially increased 
later complications compared to similar non-mesh repairs.  These procedures cannot be 
recommended for primary prolapse repair. 
Both vaginal and abdominal mesh procedures for vaginal vault prolapse repair are associated 
with similar effectiveness and complication rates compared to non mesh vaginal repair.  These 
results therefore do not clearly favour any particular vault repair procedure.
