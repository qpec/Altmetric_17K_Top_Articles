Abstract
Sarcopenia and muscle weakness are responsible for considerable health care expenditure but little is known about these 
costs in the UK. To address this, we estimated the excess economic burden for individuals with muscle weakness regarding 
the provision of health and social care among 442 men and women (aged 71–80 years) who participated in the Hertfordshire 
Cohort Study (UK). Muscle weakness, characterised by low grip strength, was defined according to the Foundation for the 
National Institutes of Health criteria (men < 26 kg, women < 16 kg). Costs associated with primary care consultations and 
visits, outpatient and inpatient secondary care, medications, and formal (paid) as well as informal care for each participant 
were calculated. Mean total costs per person and their corresponding components were compared between groups with and 
without muscle weakness. Prevalence of muscle weakness in the sample was 11%. Mean total annual costs for participants 
with muscle weakness were £4592 (CI £2962–£6221), with informal care, inpatient secondary care and primary care account-
ing for the majority of total costs (38%, 23% and 19%, respectively). For participants without muscle weakness, total annual 
costs were £1885 (CI £1542–£2228) and their three highest cost categories were informal care (26%), primary care (23%) 
and formal care (20%). Total excess costs associated with muscle weakness were £2707 per person per year, with informal 
care costs accounting for 46% of this difference. This results in an estimated annual excess cost in the UK of £2.5 billion.

Introduction
Sarcopenia is characterised by the aggressive loss of skeletal 
muscle mass and strength with age [1]. It is associated with 
increased risk of functional impairment, poor health-related 
quality of life, physical frailty and premature death [2]. Sar-
copenia is now regarded as a specific disease according to 
the International Classification of Diseases [3].
There is currently no consensus algorithm for defining 
sarcopenia. Low grip strength in older age is a risk factor 
for disability and mortality and a key component of sarco-
penia [4]. For example, the European Working Group on 
Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) defines sarcopenia 
as having weak grip strength or slow gait speed in combi-
nation with low lean mass [5] and the Foundation for the 
National Institutes of Health (FNIH) Sarcopenia Project has 
defined sarcopenia as having weak grip strength and a low 
appendicular lean mass, adjusted for BMI [6].
Sarcopenia and muscle weakness are responsible 
for considerable health care expenditure. Annual direct

medical costs attributable to sarcopenia were estimated at 
around $18.5 billion in the United States in 2000, repre-
senting 1.5% of total direct health care costs [7]. A cost-
of-illness study in the Czech Republic, comprising 689 
participants, aged 70 years and over, suggested that muscle 
weakness, indicated by low grip strength, was associated 
with increased yearly health care costs of €564 per person 
[8].
To our knowledge, no previous studies have estimated 
the economic costs of sarcopenia or muscle weakness in 
the UK. To address this gap, we have estimated the excess 
economic burden (regarding the provision of health and 
social care) for individuals with muscle weakness (identi-
fied by low grip strength according to the FNIH thresh-
olds: men < 26 kg, women < 16 kg) using data from com-
munity-dwelling men and women (aged 71–80 years) who 
participated in the Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS).
Methods
The Hertfordshire Cohort Study
The Hertfordshire Cohort Study comprises 1579 men and 
1418 women born in Hertfordshire in 1931–1939 and 
who still lived there in 1998–2004 when they attended 
a clinic visit and a nurse-administered home interview 
for a detailed characterisation of their sociodemographic, 
lifestyle and clinical characteristics. This study has been 
described in detail previously [9]. Smoking status and 
level of physical activity (Dallosso questionnaire [10]) 
were ascertained by a nurse-administered questionnaire. 
Social class was coded from the 1990 OPCS Standard 
Occupational Classification (SOC90) unit group for occu-
pation [11].
Of the 2997 baseline participants, 966 participants from 
East Hertfordshire had a dual-energy X-ray absorptiom-
etry (DXA) scan at baseline. In 2004, 642 of them were 
recruited to a clinical follow-up study. In 2011, 591 were 
invited to participate in a further follow-up study; 443 
agreed to participate [12]. Smoking status (ever/never) and 
whether participants were suffering from a limiting long-
term illness were ascertained through a nurse-administered 
questionnaire. Questions to ascertain Strawbridge frailty 
[13] and the Townsend disability scale [14], a score to 
reflect the difficulty in performing activities of daily living, 
were also asked. Participants were asked whether a doctor 
had told them that they had any of the following condi-
tions: high blood pressure, diabetes, lung disease (such as 
asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema or COPD), rheu-
matoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, thyroid disease, viti-
ligo, depression, Parkinson’s disease, heart disease (such as 
a heart attack, angina or heart failure), peripheral arterial 
disease (such as claudication), stroke, osteoporosis or can-
cer. The number of comorbidities was used as a marker of 
comorbidity.
Ascertainment of Anthropometry and Grip Strength 
at Clinic
Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a 
Harpenden pocket stadiometer (Chasmors Ltd., London, 
UK) and weight to the nearest 0.1 kg on a SECA floor 
scale (Chasmors Ltd., London, UK). Body mass index 
(BMI) was calculated as weight divided by  
height2 (kg/
m2). Grip strength was assessed three times for each hand 
using a Jamar dynamometer; the highest measurement 
was used for analysis. Muscle weakness, characterised by 
low grip strength, was defined according to FNIH criteria 
(men < 26 kg, women < 16 kg). This approach accords with 
that previously implemented in an analysis of data from 
the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe 
(SHARE) [8].
Ascertainment of Health and Social Care Use
The number of primary care visits in the previous month to 
and from general practitioners (GPs), nurses and physiother-
apists was ascertained from the nurse-administered question-
naire. The number of outpatient secondary care visits in the 
previous year to and from rheumatologists, orthopaedic sur-
geons, accident and emergency doctors, physiotherapists and 
podiatrists was also obtained. Medical procedures performed 
during the previous year were reported by participants. Par-
ticipants provided details of all prescriptions as open text, 
detailing quantity, frequency and duration. Participants were 
asked whether they had received formal (paid) care or infor-
mal care at home in the past year, including questions about 
the type, frequency and provider. Please see Online Appen-
dix 1 for further details.
Derivation of Health and Social Care Costs
Costs were calculated by multiplying quantities of resource 
use by their respective unit costs. For GP and nurse consul-
tations, the official publication of Unit Costs of Health and 
Social Care 2015 [15] was used. This was also the source of 
unit costs for outpatient secondary care consultations with 
physiotherapists and podiatrists, whilst for rheumatologists, 
orthopaedic surgeons and A&E doctors/traumatologists, unit 
costs were obtained from the 2014–2015 national reference 
costs for outpatient attendances [16].
For hospitalisations, operation-specific weighted aver-
ages of NHS reference costs were used as unit costs. These 
were calculated by identifying the set of health care resource 
 139
Health Care Costs Associated With Muscle Weakness: A UK Population-Based Estimate 
1 3
groups (HRGs), which group health care activities demand-
ing similar levels of resources, that relate to operations 
reported by participants. Weighted average unit costs were 
calculated using the activity reported for those HRGs on 
patients 70 years of age or older in national admitted patient 
care statistics [17] combined with hospital costs reported 
in the NHS National Schedule of Reference Costs tariff for 
2014–2015 [18].
Unit costs for prescriptions were obtained from the 
national report on the net ingredient cost of all prescrip-
tions dispensed in England [19]. The net ingredient cost 
per quantity (such as individual tablet or capsule) was used, 
matching the patient-reported prescription upon which the 
annual quantity of medication was estimated.
Unit costs for formal care were obtained from the Unit 
Costs of Health and Social Care 2015 publication [15], 
accounting for the differences between Social Services and 
those privately provided. For informal care, following the 
opportunity cost method [20], we used national average 
wages as an estimate for the value in monetary terms of the 
unpaid time dedicated to providing care at home. Where the 
care was provided by the participant’s children, we assumed 
they would have been employed and hence applied the aver-
age wage, whereas when provided by other friends of the 
family, we used the minimum wage. Online Appendix 2 
details the unit costs used for primary and secondary care 
visits and consultations, hospitalisations, as well as formal 
and informal care. All costs estimated are in 2015 British 
pounds.
Statistical Methods
Data were described using summary statistics. Differences 
in participant characteristics between individuals with and 
without muscle weakness were examined using t tests, χ2 
tests, Fisher’s exact tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests as 
appropriate; normality was assessed by visual inspection of 
histograms.
Mean total costs per patient during 1 year and their cor-
responding cost components were compared between indi-
viduals with and without muscle weakness, the difference 
between them considered as the excess economic burden 
associated with muscle weakness. The estimated burden was 
then combined with the observed prevalence to produce an 
estimate for the economic burden of the disease in the UK.
Patient-level excess economic burden was modelled 
adjusting for social class and for variables ascertained in 
2011 that differed significantly between the two groups to 
test their impact on the statistical significance of muscle 
weakness as a determinant of excess costs. A multivariate 
generalised linear (GL) model was estimated, with the fam-
ily distribution identified using the Modified Park Test and 
the link function based on the Akaike and Bayesian informa-
tion criteria.
Missing data for variables with a frequency equal to or 
lower than 1% was addressed by single imputation using 
regression and mean imputation. In the case of medication, 
missing quantity, frequency and/or duration was addressed 
by applying multiple imputation by chained equations meth-
ods [21] and 40 datasets were generated.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted using two alterna-
tive muscle strength criteria: < 30 kg and < 20 kg for men 
and women, respectively, proposed by Lauretani [22]; and 
the lowest decile of grip strength within each sex group. To 
produce an estimate of prevalence, we used the number of 
individuals classified as having muscle weakness over the 
total number of subjects reporting grip strength in the study. 
Statistical difference between excess costs by groups using 
these alternative criteria was assessed via the GL model 
described above.
The analysis sample consisted of the 442 participants 
(221 men and 221 women) with non-missing values for 
grip strength. Healthy participant effects were assessed by 
comparing HCS baseline participant characteristics between 
this analysis sample of 442 participants and the group of 
2555 participants who attended the HCS baseline clinic but 
were not included in the analysis sample. All analyses were 
conducted in Stata 15 (StataCorp. 2017. Stata Statistical 
Software: Release 15. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC).
Results
Participant Characteristics
The characteristics of the 442 participants according to mus-
cle strength are presented in Table 1. Median (lower quartile, 
upper quartile) age of the sample at the 2011 follow-up was 
75.5 (73.5, 77.9) years. Overall, 49 (11.1%) participants (20 
[9.0%] men and 29 [13.1%] women) had muscle weakness. 
On average, participants with muscle weakness were older 
(p = 0.008) and had higher scores for Townsend disability 
(p < 0.001) compared to those without muscle weakness. 
Having previously smoked, a limiting long-term illness and 
Strawbridge frailty were each more common among indi-
viduals with muscle weakness compared to those without 
(p < 0.01 for all associations). There were no statistically 
significant associations between muscle strength and gender 
or BMI.
Assessing Healthy Participant Effects in Analysis 
Sample
Compared to the 2555 participants who attended the HCS 
baseline clinic but were not included in the analysis sample, 
 140

both men and women in the analysis sample had higher base-
line self-reported physical activity. Men in the analysis sam-
ple were more likely to have never smoked at baseline com-
pared to men who were not included (p = 0.04). However, the 
proportion who were of manual social class (classes IIIM, 
IV and V) did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) between 
the two groups; this was the case among men and women. 
Descriptive statistics for these HCS baseline characteris-
tics, according to muscle strength in 2011, are presented 
in Table 1.
Health and Social Care Costs for Participants With 
and Without Muscle Weakness
Estimated annual costs per person for different uses of health 
and social care according to muscle strength are presented in 
Table 2 and Fig. 1. For each type of health and social care 
use, costs were greater for individuals with muscle weakness 
compared to those without. Mean yearly total costs for par-
ticipants with muscle weakness was £4592 (95% confidence 
interval: £2962–£6221), with informal care, inpatient second-
ary care and primary care being responsible for 38%, 23% and 
19% of their total costs, respectively. For participants with-
out muscle weakness, total costs were £1885 (£1542–£2228) 
and their three highest cost categories were informal care 
(26%), primary care (23%) and formal care (20%). Details of 
estimated costs by specific classification such as health care 
specialist consulted, procedure classification or prescription 
group within each cost category are summarised in Online 
Appendix 3.
The excess annual costs per person for individuals with 
muscle weakness compared to those without and the propor-
tion of these excess costs, according to types of health and 
social care use, are presented in Fig. 2. The total excess cost 
observed for individuals with muscle weakness was £2707 
per person per year, with informal care accounting for 46% of 
total excess costs. After controlling for potential confounders 
included in Table 1 (age, ever smoking, limiting long-term 
illness, social class, frailty and disability scores), highly sta-
tistically significant differences (p < 0.001) in total cost were 
still observed between individuals with and without muscles 
weakness based on a GL model using a Poisson family distri-
bution and identity link function.

Health Care Costs Associated With Muscle Weakness: A UK Population-Based Estimate 
1 3
Estimate of the Economic Burden Associated 
with Muscle Weakness in the UK
A calculation of the excess economic burden associated 
with muscle weakness in the UK is illustrated in Table 3. 
In mid-2016, the UK population aged 70 years and older 
was estimated at 8.2 million [23]. Under the assumption that 
the prevalence of muscle weakness among this group is the 
same as in HCS (11.1%), a per person per year excess cost of 
£2707 for muscle weakness results in an annual excess cost 
associated with muscle weakness of approximately £2.5 bil-
lion for the use of health and social care; corresponding

costs for health care alone (excluding formal and informal 
care) were around £1.3 billion.
Sensitivity Analyses
Using grip strength cut-points proposed by Lauretani 
(< 30 kg for men, < 20 kg for women), 118 (26.7%) partici-
pants had low grip strength and the annual per person excess 
costs were £1256; the corresponding figures for the lowest 
sex-specific decile approach were 46 (10.4%) participants 
and £2670. Highly statistically significant differences in total 
costs were obtained regardless of the grip strength criterion 
used (p < 0.001).
Discussion
Among HCS participants, the excess economic burden 
associated with muscle weakness, using FNIH thresholds 
(< 26 kg for men, < 16 kg for women), was estimated at 
£2707 per person per year; this results in an estimated total 
annual excess cost in the UK of £2.5 billion. Informal care 
was the largest contributor to these excess costs, followed 
by inpatient secondary care.
These findings have several important implications. They 
demonstrate that costs associated with muscle weakness 
represent an important proportion of the health and social 
care budgets in the UK which are projected to increase in 
the future due to the ageing population. Furthermore, these 
results demonstrate that a large proportion of these costs fall 
on family and friends in the form of informal care, resulting 
in even higher costs for the state if family and friends were 
not able to assist with care.
Our results are similar to the findings of a cost-of-ill-
ness study in the Czech Republic [8] which reported higher 
annual direct and indirect health care costs of €564 per per-
son for individuals with weak grip strength (< 26 kg among 
men, < 16 kg among women) compared to those without. A 
study among community-dwelling older people in the Neth-
erlands reported significantly higher costs among partici-
pants with EWGSOP sarcopenia (€4325 per person per three 
months, 95% CI €3198–€5471) compared to those without 
(€1533, 95% CI €1153–€1912) with residential care being a 
main driver of costs; however, differences in costs between 
sarcopenics and age- and sex-matched non-sarcopenics were 
not significant [24]. Annual direct medical costs attributable 
to sarcopenia were estimated in the United States at around 
$18.5 billion in 2000, reflecting annual per person excess 
costs associated with sarcopenia of $860 among men and 
$933 among women [7]. This was calculated by estimating 
the health care cost of disability from national surveys and 
then estimating the proportion of this cost which was due 
to sarcopenia by examining the extent to which sarcope-
nia increases the risk of physical disability. Although the 
costs per person differ between these studies, probably due 
to the different methods and unit costs used and depending 
on whether the condition was muscle weakness or sarcope-
nia, the wider literature supports the substantial economic 
burden associated with muscle weakness and sarcopenia in 
Western populations.
Previous literature has also demonstrated the substantial 
impact of sarcopenia and muscle weakness on direct hos-
pitalisation costs. Among a study of hospitalised patients 
in Portugal, EWGSOP sarcopenia increased hospitalisation 
costs by €1240 (95% CI €596–€1887) for patients < 65 years 
and €721 (95% CI €13–€1429) for patients aged ≥ 65 years 
[25]. In another study of hospitalised patients in Portugal, 
increased risks of high hospitalisation costs were observed 
for people with EWGSOP sarcopenia (OR = 5.70, 95% CI 
1.57–20.71) and low grip strength (OR = 2.40, 95% CI 
1.12–5.15) compared to those without these conditions [26]. 
Among a study of patients who underwent radical gastrec-
tomy for gastric cancer in China, the hospital costs, dura-
tion of stay and number of complications increased with 
increasing severity of EWGSOP sarcopenia (pre-sarcopenia, 
sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia) [27].
This study has some limitations. Firstly, a healthy 
responder bias has been observed in HCS and attrition 
across the various waves of follow-up could have resulted 
in additional selection effects. However, baseline partici-
pants remained broadly comparable with participants in 
the nationally representative Health Survey for England

[9] and examining participant characteristics according to 
inclusion status across the study revealed no major differ-
ences. Secondly, health care costs were estimated based on 
the conservative assumption that, when the frequency of vis-
its and consultations reported by study participants within 
the last month was once a week or higher, the frequency 
would have built up to that level and not have been constant 
at the reported frequency during the whole year. Regard-
ing prescription costs, net ingredient costs by quantity were 
used as it is the main component of the cost of drugs to the 
NHS. However, our analysis does not account for the dis-
count percentage received by pharmacists or the container 
allowance which both influence the total cost to the NHS. 
Despite this, these two costs may nearly offset each other, 
meaning ours should be a reliable estimate of prescription 
costs. Thirdly, direct assessment of muscle mass was not 
available for the analysis sample, preventing a derivation of 
sarcopenia status; instead we characterised muscle weak-
ness using the FNIH criteria on grip strength. A final limita-
tion is that this study is observational and hence estimates 
were based on the costs estimated for study participants with 
and without muscle weakness. Therefore, interventions to 
improve muscle strength among participants with muscle 
weakness, to the point where they do not have muscle weak-
ness according to the definition used in our study, may not 
significantly reduce costs as these participants are likely to 
have poorer health compared to those without muscle weak-
ness. Nevertheless, there is evidence of gains in function 
and independence in intervention studies that have promoted 
muscle strength [28], which are likely to have little effect 
on health care costs but potentially sizeable implications by 
reducing dependence of people with sarcopenia or muscle 
weakness on informal care, hence lowering broader societal 
costs. Further research is therefore required on whether life-
style interventions reduce sarcopenia or muscle weakness 
among older people and result in reductions in health and 
social care use.
Conclusion
This is the first study to show that muscle weakness in older 
people is associated with significant excess annual costs 
for health and social care in the UK of around £2.5 billion. 
These costs are projected to increase in the future due to 
the ageing population. Lifecourse interventions to reduce 
the prevalence of muscle weakness among older people are 
likely to have a substantial beneficial impact on the cost of 
health and social care in the UK.
