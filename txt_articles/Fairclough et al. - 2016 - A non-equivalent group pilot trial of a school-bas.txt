Abstract
Background: PE lessons are the formal opportunity in schools for promotion of physical activity and fitness. This study
aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a pilot PE intervention on physical activity, fitness, and psychosocial outcomes.
Methods: Participants were 139 children aged 10–11 years from four schools. For six weeks children in two schools
received a twice-weekly pilot ‘Born to Move’ (BTM) physical activity (PA) and fitness intervention alongside one regular
PE lesson. Children in the two comparison (COM) schools received their regular twice weekly PE lessons. Outcomes were
lesson time and whole-day light (LPA), moderate (MPA), vigorous (VPA), and MVPA, and sedentary time, muscular fitness,
cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), and lesson-specific perceived exertion, enjoyment, and perceived competence. Outcomes
were assessed at baseline (T0), midway through the intervention (T1), and at the end (T2) using ANOVAs and ANCOVAs.
Intervention fidelity was measured using child and teacher surveys at T2 and analysed using Chi-square tests.
Results: The BTM group engaged in moderate PA for significantly more lesson time (29.4 %) than the COM group
(25.8 %; p = .009, d = .53). The amount of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) during the T1 BTM lesson contributed 14.0 %
to total MVPA, which was significantly more than the COM group’s T1 PE lesson (11.4 %; p < .001, d = .47). The BTM group
were significantly more active during the whole-day (p < .05) and the school-day (p < .01). In both groups push-up test
performance increased (p < .001) and CRF test performance decreased (p < .01). Perceived exertion, enjoyment, and
perceived competence increased in both groups (p < .05), but the BTM group rated their enjoyment of the T1 BTM
lesson higher than the COM group rated their PE lesson (p = .02, d = .56). The children’s and teachers’ responses to the
intervention indicated that the delivery aims of enjoyment, engagement, inclusivity, and challenge were satisfied.
Conclusions: The BTM pilot programme has potential to positively impact on physical activity, fitness, and
psychosocial outcomes. Further, BTM was enjoyed by the children, and valued by the teachers. This study can
inform the design of a modified larger-scale cluster RCT evaluation.

 Background
Physical activity in childhood conveys many health bene-
fits across the physical, psychological, social, and emo-
tional domains [1]. Despite evidence highlighting the
positive health effects of active lifestyles [2–5], the major-
ity of children and young people do insufficient physical
activity of at least a moderate intensity (MPA) to achieve
current guidelines for health [1]. Moreover, physical in-
activity and increased prevalence of sedentary behaviours
in youth are associated with negative health indicators
such as obesity and type 2 diabetes [6]. Moderate-to-
vigorous physical activity (MVPA) positively influences
cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, which promote a
number of health-related benefits [2, 7], but both of which
have declining levels among youth [8, 9]. Further, accumu-
lation of light intensity physical activity (LPA) in place of
sedentary time may benefit children’s health through asso-
ciations with adiposity and cardiometabolic risk [10–12].
Thus, physical activity intervention efforts in youth are
warranted, particularly when they promote MVPA and
fitness. Intervention approaches set in and delivered
through school environments hold promise [13], as they
can facilitate a range of physical activity and fitness
opportunities, including discretionary periods between
lessons and at break times, and through more structured
and formal periods such as physical education (PE) les-
sons. Evidence indicates that school-based interventions
can be effective in enhancing physical activity, cardiore-
spiratory and muscular fitness, psychosocial outcomes
associated with physical activity such as enjoyment, and
other markers of health status in youth [2, 13–16].
PE lessons are the formal opportunity in schools for
direct delivery of health-related physical activity and fit-
ness. For this reason PE is often viewed as the primary
vehicle for promoting these outcomes in schools [17]. A
recent systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that
PE-based interventions result in children spending 10.4 %
more lesson time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
(MVPA) compared to regular PE lessons, which could have
a significant contribution to total daily physical activity
levels [18]. Moreover, there is evidence that PE interven-
tions can positively impact on health-related fitness [19,
20] and motivational constructs, such as enjoyment [21].
In England, PE is a mandatory subject in schools through
all years of compulsory schooling (ages 5 through 16 years).
Schools align their curricula to the National Curriculum
programmes of study [22], which typically emphasise trad-
itional competitive games-based activities. This narrow
curriculum structure is however, not suited to all children,
some of whom prefer activities that are more movement
and exercise oriented. Such activities that explicitly pro-
mote physical activity, fitness, and health may appeal to,
and also reflect recreational participation of a wider range
of youth than more traditional PE activities [23].
This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a
pilot PE intervention programme on selected physical
activity, fitness, and psychosocial outcomes known to
influence physical activity engagement. The specific ob-
jectives were to evaluate the effectiveness of the pilot
intervention on children’s: objectively measured LPA,
MPA, vigorous physical activity (VPA), MVPA, and sed-
entary time during lessons and during the whole-day,
muscular fitness, cardiorespiratory fitness, lesson enjoy-
ment, perceived exertion, and perceived competence.
We also sought to examine intervention fidelity, and to
provide the necessary information to calculate the sam-
ple size for a cluster RCT evaluation of the intervention
programme. The study is reported in accordance with
the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Nonran-
domized Designs (TREND) statement [24].
Methods
Design and recruitment
The study was a non-equivalent groups pilot trial of a
PE-based physical activity and fitness intervention in pri-
mary schools and was delivered between November and
December 2015. Homogenous purposive sampling was
used to recruit schools local to the university that were
known to advocate PE and physical activity initiatives
promoting children’s health and wellbeing. Four co-
educational primary schools from West Lancashire in
north-west England were initially identified from 51
schools in local School Sport Partnership. Following
meetings between the School Sport Partnership Man-
ager, the principal investigator, and school head teachers
all four of the schools agreed to participate in the pro-
ject. The schools were located in areas of relatively low
deprivation according to their location postal codes
(i.e., deciles 7–9 of the 2015 English Indices of Multiple
Deprivation) [25]. The percentage of children eligible
for free-school meals ranged from 5.5 to 23.1 %, which
was lower than the national average of 26.6 %.
All Year 6 children (age 10–11 years; n = 147) in the
schools were informed about the project by their class
teachers and those children that expressed an interest
were given an information pack to take home and share
with their parents/carers. Written informed consent
and assent were required from the parents/carers and
children respectively, before children could participate
in the project. These documents were returned to the
research team via the schools in accordance with the
project approvals granted by the University Research
Ethics Committee (reference # SPA-REC-2015-182).
Children were included if they provided the required
informed consent, assent, and medical screening forms
which indicated an absence of any medical conditions
or disabilities which prevented participation in the data
collection and/or regular PE lessons.

 Allocation to conditions
Two of the four schools were able to reorganise their
timetables to accommodate the intervention lessons, but
due to time pressures to deliver numeracy and literacy,
and demands on the limited indoor spaces for PE, this
was not possible in the other two schools. This meant
that the intervention schools were allocated prior to
baseline data being collected to allow time for reorgani-
sation of curricula and class allocations to indoor PE
spaces. The two schools that did not receive the inter-
vention acted as comparisons delivering their regular
curricula. All four schools were situated in similar geo-
graphical areas so the children were as closely matched
by catchment areas and exposure to community-based
initiatives promoting physical activity, fitness, health
and wellbeing.
Informed consent to take part was obtained from 139
children (94.6 % participation rate; 73 children in the
intervention group, 66 in the comparison group; Fig. 1).
Non-consenting children participated in BTM and PE
lessons with the rest of their classes but no research data
was collected from them. Sample size was not deter-
mined by a formal calculation as this was deemed un-
necessary for a pilot study of this nature [26, 27]. The
sample was representative of the target study population
(i.e., Year 6 children in West Lancashire who regularly
participate in PE lesson) and was based on relatively
equal class sizes in the participating schools. Moreover,
our sample size was larger than the median of 30 par-
ticipants per arm reported for pilot studies in the UK
with continuous variable endpoints [26].
Intervention
This study piloted a structured class-based physical
activity and fitness programme entitled Born to Move
(BTM; http://www.lesmills.com/borntomove). BTM is an
age-adapted portfolio of class-based physical activity and
fitness programmes set to music with an emphasis on
enjoyable and inclusive activity. The classes teach age-
appropriate motor skills designed to improve health-
related and skill-related fitness. The activities were de-
livered through eight combined movement categories
Fig. 1 Flow of participants through the study
Fairclough et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:861 
Page 3 of 14
 (Table 1) set to contemporary music tracks of varying
tempo. The format of the lessons was specifically de-
signed for mixed-sex groups of children in the 8–12
years age range. The lessons were designed to be enjoy-
able, differentiated, and inclusive, yet challenging and
requiring concentration and physical effort. The lessons
were intended to last for at least 30 min and were
taught in the schools’ PE halls to the intact mixed-sex
and mixed ability Year 6 classes. All of the BTM lessons
were taught free of charge by one trained female
instructor of 10 years experience who is a BTM UK
instructor trainer. She adhered closely to the child-
centred principles that are central to the BTM in-
structor training. These include understanding how
children learn, group observation and interaction, role
modelling, demonstrating a positive attitude to physical
activity, and having flexible teaching strategies to meet
the needs of different groups and individuals. The inter-
vention’s emphasis on enjoyable and inclusive lesson
content delivered by an expert instructor is consistent
with the Youth Physical Activity Promotion Model
(YPAPM [28]) which provided a conceptual framework
for the intervention evaluation. The YPAPM recognises
that children’s physical activity is influenced to varying
degrees by predisposing, enabling, reinforcing, and per-
sonal demographic factors, and their mutual interac-
tions. Predisposing factors in particular are highlighted
in the model as significant predictors of physical activity
participation [29], and include self-evaluative constructs
(e.g., perceived competence) and a cognitive assessment
of the perceived outcomes of activity (e.g., enjoyment,
interest) [28].
Each week for six consecutive weeks, children in the
intervention schools received
two BTM lessons
in
addition to one regular PE lesson. The regular PE
lessons lasted between 30 and 45 min and were taught
by the usual Year 6 class teachers or teaching assistants
in accordance with the planned PE curricula for those
weeks. The BTM instructor and Year 6 teachers in the
BTM schools were fully aware that their classes were
receiving the intervention. The research team were not
involved in implementing any aspect of the intervention
and knew the children only by their study identifier
numbers. Children from the two comparison schools
(COM) did not receive the BTM intervention and in-
stead took part in their regular twice-weekly PE lessons
which covered activities including netball, benchball,
hand-tennis, cricket, dance, and fitness circuits. These
lessons were taught by the usual Year 6 class teachers
and were intended to last between 30 and 45 min. At
the end of the six-week intervention all consenting chil-
dren in the BTM and COM groups received a £10 gift
voucher that could be used in a variety of online and
high street retailers. Following completion of the project
BTM after-school clubs were planned in all four partici-
pating schools for the 2016 summer term, after which a
BTM community programme would be implemented in
the local leisure centre. These programmes would be
delivered by trained instructors based in the schools
and local community.
Baseline data collection (T0) commenced in the week
of 19th October 2015 which was followed by a one-week
half-term break. The intervention pilot began in the
week of 2nd November 2015 and ended the week of 7th
December 2015. Data were also collected halfway through
the intervention (T1) and at the end (T2).
Outcome measures
Outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of the
pilot BTM programme were assessed at T0 before the
6-week intervention, at T1, and where measured, at T2.
The primary study outcomes were: LPA, MPA, VPA,
MVPA, and sedentary time during lessons, muscular
and cardiorespiratory fitness, and enjoyment, perceived
exertion, and perceived competence during lessons.
Secondary outcomes were: whole-day, school-day, and
after-school through evening physical activity and seden-
tary time. These outcomes were measured on a selected
BTM or PE lessons day rather than averaged across the
entire week. All data collection measures were adminis-
tered by trained researchers who were un-blinded to the
classes’ allocations to the BTM and COM groups.
Socioeconomic status
Area level socio-economic status was calculated using
the 2015 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) [25]
derived from parent/carer reported home postal codes.
Higher IMD scores represent areas of higher relative
deprivation and lower scores indicate areas of lower
relative deprivation.

 Anthropometrics
All children undertook anthropometric assessments at
the school sites according to standard procedures [30].
Height and sitting height were measured to the nearest
0.1 cm using a portable stadiometer (Seca 213 height
measure, Seca UK, Birmingham, UK). Body mass was
measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using calibrated digital
scales (Seca 877 digital scales, Seca UK, Birmingham,
UK). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from height
and body mass as a proxy measure of body composition
(kg · m2), and BMI z-scores were assigned to each child
[31]. Age and sex-specific BMI cutpoints were used to
classify children’s weight status [32]. Gender-specific re-
gression equations [33] were used to predict children’s
maturity offset (i.e., age from peak height velocity),
which
was
used
as
a
proxy
measure
of
somatic
maturation.
Muscular fitness
The FITNESSGRAM push-up test was administered as a
measure of upper body muscular fitness [34]. The chil-
dren completed as many repetitions as possible and the
test was terminated if the children did not maintain the
prescribed cadence or they did not achieve a 90° angle
with the elbow. The standing long jump test was used as
a measure of lower body muscular fitness [35]. The lon-
gest distance jumped was recorded in cm from the best
of three attempts.
Cardiorespiratory fitness: Andersen test
Children completed a modified version of the Andersen
Test which is a 10-min 20 m intermittent shuttle run/
rest test of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF; [36]). The test
has recently been shown to be valid and reliable for pro-
viding group level estimates of CRF in 10 year old chil-
dren [37]. Due to indoor space restrictions in the
schools, the distance between the two lines was modified
to 10 m rather than the usual 20 m. Prior advice on this
modification was taken from the test’s author, who
highlighted that reducing the shuttle run distance would
increase the number of times the children would need
to turn, which would likely lead to an underestimation
of CRF because of the additional energy cost associated
with the extra turning (personal correspondence, Octo-
ber 2015). As all of the schools would use the 10 m
adaptation of the test and therefore between- and
within-group differences would be consistent, it was de-
cided to proceed with this modification. The test con-
sisted of the children shuttle running from one end line
to the other for 10 min. Every 15 s a digital audio cue
sounded which signaled for the children to stop and rest,
or resume running. The research team counted the
number of shuttles completed in 10 min, after which the
test ended. The children were encouraged to keep
running at their own pace as per the test protocol [37].
Total distance completed was recorded and peak VO2
was estimated using sex-specific equations [37].
Post-lesson questionnaire measures
At the end of BTM and PE lessons children were asked
to rate their perceived exertion for the lesson overall by
completing the Children’s OMNI Perceived Exertion
Scale for Stepping Exercise [38]. Enjoyment and per-
ceived competence in relation to BTM or PE lessons
were assessed using four items from the short-form In-
trinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) [39], which measures
underlying constructs of intrinsic motivation and has
been used previously in PE research [40, 41]. The short-
form IMI has demonstrated satisfactory construct valid-
ity [39] and was developed for use in school settings
when data collection time is limited. Items were modi-
fied to make them situational-specific [42] and responses
were recorded on a 7-point Likert scale.
Objectively measured physical activity and sedentary time
Physical activity and sedentary time were objectively
measured
using
triaxial
accelerometers
(Actigraph
GT9X, ActiGraph LLC, FL, USA). The Actigraph moni-
tor has demonstrated validity and reliability in estimat-
ing children’s physical activity and sedentary time across
a range of ages [43]. Children wore the monitors on
their non-dominant wrists during selected T0 and T1
PE and/or BTM lessons. On a selected T1 day when
children were scheduled for BTM or PE, the monitors
were also worn from waking to bedtime to investigate
the contribution of the BTM and PE lessons to overall
physical activity and sedentary time. It was not logistic-
ally possible to measure whole-day activity during T0
because timetabling of PE between schools occurred on
the same day or on consecutive days. As a consequence,
the limited number of available accelerometers meant
that concurrent monitoring in different schools was not
possible. Greater timetable flexibility in the second half
of the term allowed whole-day monitoring during T1.
To be included in the whole-day analysis, children
needed to wear the accelerometer for at least 540 min.
Accelerations were recorded at a frequency of 30 Hz
and were subsequently converted to counts per 1 s
epochs. Percentages of BTM/PE lesson time, and whole-
day, school-day, and after-school through evening mi-
nutes spent sedentary, and in light (LPA), moderate
(MPA), vigorous (VPA), moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity (MVPA), and total physical activity (total PA; i.e.,
LPA through to VPA) were calculated based on wrist
count cutpoints developed by Chandler et al. [44]. Data
reduction and preliminary analysis of the accelerometer
data were conducted in Actilife (version 6.11.5, theActi-
graph.com, Pensacola, FL).

 Intervention fidelity
To assess intervention fidelity the number and duration
of planned BTM lessons were recorded and at T2 the
children in the BTM schools completed a 14-item survey
which asked about perceptions of the BTM lessons, how
they were taught, and what impact they had had. A sim-
ple ‘yes/no’ structure was used with children asked about
their perceptions of BTM. Questions related to areas
such as perceived challenge (e.g., “Did you find the
BORN TO MOVE lessons a challenge?”), motivation
(e.g., “Did the BORN TO MOVE teacher motivate you
to try hard?”, and “Did doing the BORN TO MOVE les-
sons to music motivate you to try hard?”), and adaptability
(e.g., “Did the BORN TO MOVE teacher change or adapt
any movements or skills that seemed difficult so they were
easier to do?”). The intervention class teachers were asked
to complete a free-text evaluation of the programme,
which asked them to comment on the delivery of the
BTM lessons, and the intervention’s influence on the
children’s lesson engagement and competence, class-
room learning, and general wellbeing.
Data analysis
Preliminary analysis
Preliminary analyses checked the distribution of the
variables by group (BTM vs. COM). Across the three
time points, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests revealed that
the majority of variables were not normally distributed.
Logarithmic and reciprocal transformations were ap-
plied to the data and while these normalised some of
the variables for at least one time point, this outcome
was not consistent across all variables and time points.
Thus, on the basis that ANOVA models are generally
robust to violations of the normality assumption [45] it
was decided to proceed with parametric tests. The
exception to this was where the data were categorical,
or where the data were skewed and there was no need
to include covariates in the main analyses.
Baseline data analysis
The initial analysis of T0 data investigated equivalence
between the BTM and COM groups. Between-group
differences in the primary and secondary outcomes
were analysed using Mann–Whitney tests or independent
t-tests, depending on the distribution of the outcome data.
Study outcomes did not differ at T0 between the BTM
and COM groups (p > .05) with the exception of IMD
scores (BTM > COM; p = .004), and PE/BTM lesson ac-
celerometer data for physical activity (LPA, MPA, VPA,
MVPA, and total PA; BTM > COM; p < .001), and seden-
tary time (BTM < COM; p < .001). Subsequent analyses
of PE/BTM lesson physical activity and sedentary time
included baseline physical activity or sedentary time
values as covariates. Group (BTM vs. COM) x sex
ANOVAs were employed to check for differences in out-
comes between boys and girls in the BTM and COM
groups. For push-ups there was a significant sex x group
interaction effect (p = .021) which indicated that the
BTM boys’ performance was superior to the girls,
whereby the COM boys and girls performed similarly.
The same sex x group interaction (p = .001) and data
trends were observed for standing long-jump. As a con-
sequence, sex was included as a covariate in the main
analyses of push-ups and standing long jump.
Main analysis
As children were nested within schools, the variability
between school-level data was examined via multilevel
analyses. Little variability was seen between schools for
all outcome measures (all ICCs < .05 [46]), therefore fur-
ther multilevel analyses were deemed unnecessary, and
child-level data were analysed to evaluate intervention
effectiveness. Intervention effects on the primary and
secondary outcomes were assessed using group (BTM,
COM) x time (T0, T1, T2) ANOVAs or ANCOVAs.
Appropriate prognostic covariates were included in
these analyses based on their known influence on the
outcomes [47]. Analysis of push-up performance was
adjusted for sex, BMI z-score [48, 49] and IMD score
[50, 51], while sex, body mass [49], leg length [35, 52],
and IMD score [50, 51] were covariates in the analysis
of standing long-jump performance. The effect of the
intervention on CRF was assessed through analysis of total
distance covered during the Andersen test, and estimated
peak VO2. The analysis of shuttle run distance was ad-
justed for BMI z-score [8] and IMD score [50, 51]. Esti-
mated peak VO2 expressed as ml⋅kg⋅min−1 was adjusted
for IMD score. The post-BTM and PE lesson question-
naire scores were analysed using group x time ANOVAs
with the exception of the analysis of perceived exertion
which used ANCOVA with adjustment for BMI z-scores.
One-way between-group ANCOVAs compared differ-
ences in the absolute and percentage of BTM or PE lesson
time spent in different physical activity intensities. These
analyses controlled for T0 values of the outcomes, and
BMI z-scores. The percentage contribution of the BTM
and PE lessons to overall MVPA and to the 60 min/day
MVPA minimum recommendation for health [1] were
compared using Mann–Whitney tests. Between-group
differences in time spent in objectively measured
whole-day, school-day, and after-school through even-
ing physical activity and sedentary time were assessed
using one-way ANCOVAs with adjustment for IMD
scores, BMI z-scores, and accelerometer wear time.
Sample size analysis
MPA during PE was chosen as the main outcome for sam-
ple size estimation because the BTM programme generally
Fairclough et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:861 
Page 6 of 14
 involves
moderate intensity activities more so than
moderate-to-vigorous intensity activities. Potential sample
sizes for a future RCT were estimated using PINT 2.12
statistical power analysis software [53]. Calculations were
based on several key assumptions: 1) a future RCT would
have one intervention and one control arm, 2) a common
standard deviation, and 3) the smallest effect size worth
identifying for between-group difference would be 6.5 min
during a PE lesson. Based on our observed MPA and VPA
pilot data this increase would amount to 50 % of BTM
lesson time in MVPA which reflects recommendations for
health-enhancing PE [54, 55].
Sub-group analyses
Sub-group analyses on the primary and secondary out-
comes were conducted to evaluate whether the effects of
the BTM pilot differed between boys and girls. These
analyses involved sex-specific analyses of the primary
outcomes over time with adjustment where appropriate
for the same covariates as in the main analyses.
Intervention fidelity
Percentage responses and Chi-Square tests were used to
evaluate the children’s responses to the end of programme
survey. Teachers’ free-text responses were grouped ac-
cording to the main themes of lesson enjoyment, teacher
delivery, child engagement, and general wellbeing.
All quantitative data were entered into a Microsoft
Excel database (Excel for Mac version 15.17, Microsoft,
Redmond, WA). Following data cleaning and checking
the data were uploaded to IBM SPSS Statistics (version
22, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) for analysis. Alpha was set
at p < .05, and where effect sizes (d) were calculated their
magnitude was described according to Cohen [56].
Results
Descriptive characteristics of the participants
BTM and COM children were well matched across the
majority of measures (Table 2). The children typically re-
sided in areas of relatively low deprivation though there
was some variation in this with 19 % of children living
in the lowest five IMD deciles nationally. The overweight
and obesity prevalence of the children participating in
this project (BTM = 25.7 % and COM = 20.6 %) was
lower than the local norm in West Lancashire of 35 %.
Primary outcomes
Physical activity and sedentary time during BTM and
PE lessons
The mean BTM lesson and PE lesson durations were
43.6 ± 2.2 min and 36.1 ± 4.7 min, respectively. The BTM
group were sedentary for 6.6 % less lesson time than the
COM group (p = .055, d = .40; Table 3). Furthermore, the
BTM group engaged in MPA for significantly more lesson
time (3.6 %; p = .009, d = .53) than the COM group. There
were no significant differences in the percentage of lesson
time spent LPA, VPA, MVPA, or total PA. The BTM
group engaged in significantly more minutes of LPA,
MPA, MVPA, and total PA than COM group peers
(p < .001; Table 3). The amount of MVPA that the
children engaged in during the T1 BTM lesson contrib-
uted 14.0 % to their total MVPA for that day, which
was significantly more than the contribution of the T1
PE lesson to the COM group’s whole-day MVPA
(11.4 %; p < .001, d = .47). Furthermore, MVPA during
the T1 BTM lesson represented 31.8 % of the daily
minimum of 60 min MVPA guideline [1], which was
significantly more than the 25.6 % contribution from
the T1 PE lesson (p < .001, d = .60).
Muscular fitness
Push-up test performance improved overall regardless
of group (p < .001, d = .81; Table 4). The BTM group
improved by 111 % between T0 and T2 compared to
the COM group’s 68 %. Although a significant time x
group interaction effect was observed (p = 0.02), simple
effects analyses revealed no significant between-group
differences at each time point. Modest non-significant
improvements in standing long jump performance were
observed in the BTM group (4.2 % increase) relative to
the COM group (0.8 % increase).

 Cardiorespiratory fitness
The total distance completed during the Andersen
shuttle run test decreased significantly in both groups
at each measurement point (p = .004, d = .03; Table 4).
Resultant estimates of peak VO2 also declined in both
groups over time (p = .001, d = .18). There were no sig-
nificant group x time interaction effects.
Post-lesson questionnaires
Overall, the children rated the T1 lessons as more enjoy-
able than the T0 lessons (p = .001, d = .38). A significant
group x time interaction was observed for lesson enjoy-
ment (p = .049) which indicated that the BTM group
rated their enjoyment of the T1 BTM lesson higher than
the COM group rated their PE lesson (p = .02, d = .56).
Overall time effects but no group x time interactions
were evident for perceived exertion (p < .001, d = 1.1)
and perceived competence (p = .012, d = .40).
Secondary outcomes
Whole-day physical activity and sedentary time
On the day when the children wore the accelerometers
during waking hours, wear time was 13.1 h and 13.4 h for
the BTM and COM groups, respectively. The BTM group
accumulated significantly more LPA (11.3 min difference;
p = .006, d = .21; Fig. 2), MPA (8.3 min difference; p = .026,
d = .15), MVPA (9.8 min difference; p = .044, d = .14), and
total PA (15.8 min difference; p = .033, d = .18) than the
COM group. There were no differences in VPA, but the
BTM group spent 21.1 fewer minutes than the COM
group in sedentary activity (p = .008, d = .39).

 School day, and after-school through evening physical
activity and sedentary time
During the school day the BTM group accumulated sig-
nificantly more LPA (6.8 min difference; p = .001, d = .48;
Fig. 2), MPA (7.0 min difference; p = .001, d = .48),
MVPA (8.3 min difference; p = .007, d = .38), total PA
(13.1 min difference; p = .002, d = .49), and significantly
less sedentary time (17 min difference; p = .001, d = .59)
than the COM group. There were no differences in
school day VPA. In contrast, after-school and evening
physical activity and sedentary time were similar for
both groups (p > .05).
Sample size analysis
For a trial powered to detect a 6.5 min between-group
difference in MPA during PE, 16 schools with 23 chil-
dren per school would be required (n = 368; power = .80,
α = .05). We calculated the school-level ICC (0.014) for
MPA during PE at T2 (95 % CI = < .001 to 0.072) and
used the upper 95 % CI in our estimate. A recent review
highlighted the mean attrition for child physical activity
interventions to be 11.5 % (range 0 – 30 %) [57]. There-
fore, a future trial using a conservative 20 % attrition
rate would require a sample of n = 442 children.
Sub-group analyses
Exploratory analyses were conducted to investigate whether
the intervention effects differed between the BTM boys
and girls. Significant sub-group effects are reported. Rela-
tive to T0, BTM girls’ push-up test performances improved
by 51 % at T1 and by 137 % at T2 (p < .001, d = 1.02). An
improvement of 57 % was observed between T1 and T2
(p = .005, d = .50). Boys’ push-up test performances im-
proved by 78 % between T0 and T1 (p < .001, d = .85),
and by 93 % between T0 and T2 (p < .001; d = 1.03), with
little change between T1 and T2. The boys’ BTM group
total distance completed during the Andersen shuttle
run test decreased significantly at T2 compared to T0
(−41.9 m; p < .001, d = .60) and T1 (−27.8 m; p = .034,
d = .33). Estimates of boys’ peak VO2 also declined at T2
relative to T0 (−2.3 ml · kg∙min−1; p < .001, d = .26) and T1
(−1.5 ml · kg∙min−1; p = .02, d = .12). Girls (p = .028,
d = .75) and boys (p = .005, d = .70) in the BTM group
reported significantly higher enjoyment scores during
the T1 BTM lessons compared to the T0 PE lessons.
Boys reported higher perceived exertion during the T1
BTM than during the T0 PE lessons (p = .003, d = 1.01)
but the difference in girls was negligible. Girls’ per-
ceived competence was higher during the T1 BTM les-
sons relative to the T0 PE lessons (p = .015, d = .51) but
there were no differences among the boys. During the
T0 PE lessons BTM girls engaged in significantly more
MPA (p = .004, d = .49), VPA (p < .001, d = .48), MVPA
(p < = .001, d = .78), and less sedentary activity (p < .001,
d = 1.08) than during the T1 BTM lessons. Similarly, in
comparison to the T1 BTM lessons, the BTM boys
engaged in significantly more LPA (p = .006, d = 1.04),
MPA (p = .002, d = .80), VPA (p = .001, d = .43), MVPA
(p < .001, d = .65), and less sedentary activity (p < .001,
d = 1.30) during the T0 PE lessons.
Intervention fidelity
In each BTM school 12 BTM lessons were scheduled
over the 6-week programme, with each lesson lasting for
Fig. 2 T1 adjusted† school-day, after-school through evening, and whole-day physical activity outcomes (means and 95 % confidence intervals)
Fairclough et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:861 
Page 9 of 14
 a minimum of 30 min to ensure the lesson objectives
could be achieved. All 24 lessons were delivered as
planned and the mean lesson duration was 43.6 ± 2.2 min
which indicates that sufficient time was available to meet
the planned objectives. All 73 children assigned to the
BTM intervention condition received the intervention,
though as attendance registers were not taken during
classes, it is unknown how many children received the
full dose of 24 lessons.
The BTM lessons included activities focused on health
and skill-related fitness, and aimed to be enjoyable,
engaging, and inclusive, yet challenging. The children’s
responses to the T2 survey provided insight into how
well these aims had been had achieved. All the children
indicated that they enjoyed the BTM lessons (p < .001).
All of the girls and 95 % of boys found the lessons inter-
esting (p < .001), and around two-thirds of the children
thought that the BTM lessons were physically challen-
ging. Between 86 and 100 % of the children thought that
after completing the BTM lessons they felt fitter, stron-
ger, and healthier (p < .001). All of the children indicated
that the BTM teacher made the lessons fun (p < .001),
and the vast majority (100 % of girls, 92 % of boys) felt
that she motivated them to try hard (p < .001). Similarly,
90 % of girls and 84 % of boys felt that doing the
BTM lessons to music also motivated them to try hard
(p < .001). Most of the children (59 % of girls, 68 % of
boys; p < .05) recognized that the teacher changed or
adapted the BTM movements or skills when necessary
so as to differentiate to the classes’ abilities, and over
94 % of the children felt that they could perform the
moves and skills correctly at the end of the 6 weeks
(p < .001). A large proportion of the children (86 %
girls, 79 % boys) felt that they were able to concentrate
better on their class work following the BTM lessons
(p < .001). Finally, 90 % of girls and 87 % of boys stated
that they would take part in a BTM after-school club if
one was available (p < .001).
The class teachers in the BTM schools observed the
lessons over the duration of the programme, and mirror-
ing the views of the children, also commented positively
about the BTM teacher (“motivational and inspiring”),
the music, and how the lessons were fun. The teachers
also noted how the BTM teacher and lesson content
provided challenge and “really encouraged the children
to value their own efforts” and “to push themselves”.
The teachers stated how the girls and boys engaged
equally well in the lessons, though initially some of the
less confident boys were reluctant to stand towards the
front of the group. There was a strong belief that the
BTM lessons could have a “huge impact on the children
academically, socially, and (help to) build their confi-
dence”. Teachers also made reference to seeing the chil-
dren grow in confidence during and sometimes outside
of the BTM lessons. In one school this improvement in
confidence was evident among children who previously
were disengaged during regular PE classes, but who
“have commented how much they have enjoyed the
(BTM) sessions”.
Discussion
This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a pilot
school-based physical activity and fitness intervention
on physical activity, fitness, and psychosocial outcomes.
Significant intervention effects were observed for MPA
during lessons, lesson enjoyment, as well as whole-day
and school-day physical activity and sedentary time.
Physical activity and sedentary time during BTM and
PE lessons
The BTM group spent more BTM lesson time in MPA
than the COM group did during PE. The corresponding
absolute difference in MVPA lesson engagement was
4.5 min. This was in line with the ~4.5 min difference
between intervention and regular PE MVPA reported in
a review of elementary school PE physical activity [58],
but was less than the 10.4 % difference reported in a
more recent systematic review and meta-analysis of
MVPA during PE interventions [18]. In this review over
25 % of the interventions were based on PE delivery
through ‘fitness infusion strategies’ [18]. The nature of
the studies included under this heading suggests that the
intervention lessons involved integration of high-intensity
CRF-promoting activities. The BTM intervention employed
variable intensity activities and movements such as CRF fit-
ness-promoting (e.g., high intensity kicks), muscular
fitness-promoting (e.g., body weight activities), and
sedentary relaxation activities. Thus, it was expected
that differences in MVPA between the BTM and regu-
lar PE lessons would be less than those reported in
previous fitness-oriented PE interventions. The 14.0 %
contribution of BTM
lesson MVPA to whole-day
MVPA was though greater than or similar to that
found in the small number of previous accelerometer
studies reporting PE’s contribution to daily physical ac-
tivity (e.g., [59, 60]). Collectively, these findings under-
score the potential of regular PE classes to make an
important contribution to health-enhancing MVPA.
Further, our results suggest that the BTM intervention
model made a significantly greater contribution to
whole-day MVPA than regular PE lessons.
Physical activity and sedentary time beyond BTM and
PE lessons
The unadjusted between-group differences in mean
MVPA for BTM vs. PE (4.2 min) and the whole-day
(4.1 min) suggest that the whole-day differences were at-
tributed to the superior MVPA during BTM compared
Fairclough et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:861 
Page 10 of 14
 to regular PE lessons. A 6.6 min between-group differ-
ence in school-day MVPA however, infers that outside
the BTM lesson an additional 2.5 min of MVPA was
accumulated over the school day. While the precise
mechanisms for activity accumulation are unknown, it is
plausible that individual, interpersonal, and environmen-
tal factors may have interplayed in the BTM group to
stimulate additional school-day physical activity beyond
the BTM lessons. The physical, social, and pedagogical
environments that children interact with at school influ-
ence activity-related behaviours [61], and it has been
suggested that some children may be stimulated to accu-
mulate more physical activity when presented with
active opportunities during school [61, 62]. Moreover, it
is possible that the significant between-group differences
in school-day and whole-day sedentary time were related
to these increased activity levels. In particular, improve-
ments in LPA and displacement of sedentary time may
be important for children’s health through associations
with adiposity, cardiometabolic risk, and other health
outcomes [10–12]. There were though no between-
group differences in physical activity and sedentary time
during the after-school through evening period, which
suggest that the BTM group were relatively less active
by around 2.5 min in the before- or after-school periods
or in the evening [63]. Because these findings are based
on data from a single day we are unable to ascertain
whether the BTM group truly compensated for their
greater school-day MVPA by reducing their out of
school activity through biologically-driven ‘activitystat’
regulation [64].
Muscular and cardiorespiratory fitness
At T0 and T2 29 and 72 % of the BTM group, and 35
and 51 % of the COM group, respectively, achieved the
FITNESSGRAM Healthy Fitness Zone criterion standard
of ≥ 7 push-ups [34]. The BTM group’s improvement
may have been partially influenced by the nature of the
floor-based body weight-bearing movements included in
the BTM lessons. The repeated administration of the
push-up test protocol at T0 through T2 and resultant
learning effect also likely increased test familiarisation
and therefore performance among children in both
groups [65]. Standing long jump performances of the
children in both groups were comparable or superior to
those observed in other European children [52, 66, 67].
Although a learning effect likely influenced standing
long jump performance to some degree, variation in
neuromuscular maturation and therefore appropriately
coordinated technique possibly contributed more to the
lack of observed intervention effect [52].
Distance covered during the Andersen test and esti-
mated VO2 peak values were lower in both groups than
reported in Danish children [37, 68], and significantly
decreased between time points. Though this decrease
over time was unexpected, we do not believe it reflects a
true attenuation of the children’s CRF levels. The Andersen
test requires children to self-pace and for some this ap-
peared challenging over the duration of the test [69]. We
observed that during the 15-s rest periods some children’s
concentration waivered, and this was reflected in fluctua-
tions in running speed during the subsequent running
periods. Moreover, some children’s motivation to complete
as many shuttles as possible appeared low, which was man-
ifested in some cases by very slow running and even walk-
ing. Children’s motivation during field tests of CRF is
recognised as a threat to validity [69], and it has previously
been observed that children’s motivational reactions to
shuttle run fitness tests are extremely variable, depending
on each child’s goal profile, performance, and perceived
success [70]. For these reasons the Andersen test results
should be interpreted with caution.
Enjoyment and perceived competence during BTM and
PE lessons
The BTM lessons were rated as significantly more enjoy-
able than regular PE. This has important implications
for children’s motivation to engage in physical activity as
well as maintaining participation, as evidence demon-
strates that experiencing enjoyment in physical activity
settings, such as PE, can enhance intrinsic motivation
and increase the likelihood of continued participation
[71, 72]. Both groups demonstrated increased perceived
competence in the T1 BTM and PE lessons. Harter’s
competence motivation theory posits that successful
attempts to master a skill can increase perceived compe-
tence, leading to increases in intrinsic motivation [73].
This theory has been applied in PE settings with perceived
competence being shown to significantly influence chil-
dren’s motivation and physical activity behaviour [74]. In
addition to the independent influences of enjoyment and
perceived competence on physical activity motivation,
both factors influence each other in a reciprocal manner
[75]. Low perceived competence in children is associated
with lower levels of physical activity enjoyment [75], and
enjoyment is known to increase when perceived com-
petence is enhanced [76, 77]. This is especially true for
girls [75], a point which is supported by our results
showing significant improvements in girls’ perceived
competence
alongside
increased
enjoyment
(albeit
non-significant) during T1 BTM lessons relative to T0
PE lessons. This previous research lends credence to
our findings where the BTM group increased enjoy-
ment and perceived competence. Since these aspects of
motivation are known to influence engagement and
adherence to physical activity, programmes such as
BTM can play a role in increasing physical activity during
PE and school hours.

 Intervention fidelity
Data from the T2 survey on fidelity of lesson delivery
demonstrated that the children found the BTM lessons
to be challenging, motivating and adaptable to their skills
levels. These favourable factors are linked to increased
intervention adherence [78] as well as being predictors of
physical activity [79]. Although based on limited data,
results indicated that intervention fidelity was good and
that intervention school teachers saw BTM as a positive
influence on the children that provided motivation for
physical activity engagement. Buy in and support from key
stakeholders such as teachers is essential for the success of
any behavioural intervention [80]. The Diffusion of Inno-
vations model identifies stakeholders such as teachers as
essential for transfer of interventions into practice through
input in the decision to participate [81]. Teachers also
help to provide access to the target participants, and as
was the case in BTM, their continuing support is import-
ant for institutionalisation of interventions and increased
likelihood of sustainability [81]. The pilot BTM inter-
vention, while brief in duration, was highly regarded by
teachers and children. Findings indicate that in future
iterations of the programme, they and others may be
likely to contribute to its diffusion into practice. The
fact that after the study some of the teachers attended
BTM instructor training to enable them to lead BTM
after-school clubs is evidence of this. It should though
also be noted that individual schools or school partner-
ships would usually be required to pay a monthly BTM
licence fee. Notwithstanding the positive findings in
relation to feasibility and fidelity, this cost implication
may be a barrier to some schools accessing and/or sus-
taining the programme.
Sample size for a cluster RCT
Sample size calculations indicated that a future RCT
would need 442 children to detect a between-group dif-
ference of 6.5 min of MPA during PE. Our pilot data
suggest that this increase is feasible and would help
contribute to MPA during PE as well as the whole-day.
Moreover, based on our pilot data, 6.5 min of MPA
would equate to a 10.1 % difference between a BTM
intervention and regular PE group, which is comparable
to the average MVPA difference of 10.4 % reported in a
recent systematic review (51) of MVPA during PE inter-
ventions. Based on our observed MPA and VPA pilot
data this increase would also amount to 50 % of BTM
lesson time in MVPA which reflects recommendations
for health-enhancing PE [54, 55].
Strengths and limitations
Major strengths of this pilot study were the quasi-
experimental control group design used to evaluate an
existing intervention programme in ‘real world’ school
settings. Involvement of a lead BTM instructor ensured
high quality delivery of the intervention that was made
available to all Year 6 children in the intervention
schools. A small number of schools participated in the
study and the modest sample size may not have been
powered to detect differences between groups. Further,
the schools were a convenience sample selected based
on their advocacy for PE and physical activity initiatives.
It is possible that this may have limited the observed
intervention effects, particularly in Comparison schools
that
strongly
emphasised
PE
and
physical
activity
engagement. Though it would not be the intention to
exclude such schools from any future RCT, randomised
sampling procedures would be applied to limit threats to
internal validity. Moreover, to limit recruitment bias in a
future RCT, schools would need to commit to having
sufficiently flexible timetabling arrangements for them
to be allocated to intervention or comparison conditions
after baseline data collection. To limit the impact on
BTM and PE lesson time, questionnaire and physical ac-
tivity data were collected on two occasions. It is likely
that there were between-lesson variations in the chil-
dren’s engagement and physical activity which may not
have been captured. Whole-day physical activity and
sedentary time was assessed at T1 using single-day ra-
ther than multiple day accelerometer measurement pro-
tocols. The schools were reluctant for the children to
take the monitors home over multiple days, so it was
not possible to know whether the observed whole-day
activity and sedentary levels accurately reflected the chil-
dren’s typical levels of activity. The modified Andersen
Test possibly compromised the accuracy of the measure
of CRF. Subsequent measurement of CRF would be
undertaken using alternative methods that may be less
prone to variations in individual-child motivation and
pacing capabilities. Intervention fidelity was investigated
using a ‘light touch’ approach through the T2 child and
teacher surveys. Though more in-depth process evalu-
ation measures (e.g., lesson observations, focus groups)
would have been desirable, limited staffing resources and
the need to limit the study’s impact on school curricu-
lum time prevented this.
Conclusions
The BTM pilot programme was effective in engaging
children in significantly more MPA than during regular
PE. The amount of MVPA that the BTM children took
part in during lessons contributed significantly more to
whole-day MVPA compared to MVPA during regular
PE. Moreover, enjoyment levels during the BTM lessons
were significantly higher compared to regular PE. On
the days when BTM lessons were scheduled, the inter-
vention children did significantly more whole-day and
school-day physical activity and less sedentary activity

 than COM group peers. Improved push-up and reduced
CRF test performances were observed in both groups.
This study
has
demonstrated
that
the
BTM pilot
programme was feasible to deliver in English primary
schools, was enjoyed by the children, valued by the
teachers, and provided favourable results indicating its
potential to positively impact on physical activity, fitness,
and psychosocial outcomes. On the basis of these results
there is scope for this study to inform the design of a
modified larger-scale cluster RCT evaluation.
Acknowledgments
