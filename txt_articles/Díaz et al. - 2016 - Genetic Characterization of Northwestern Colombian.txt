Abstract.
Chikungunya fever, an acute and often chronic arthralgic disease caused by the mosquito-borne alphavirus,
chikungunya virus (CHIKV), spread into the Americas in late 2013. Since then it has caused epidemics in nearly all New
World countries, the second largest being Colombia with over 450,000 suspected cases beginning in September, 2014, and
focused in Bolivar Department in the north. We examined 32 human sera from suspected cases, including diverse age
groups and both genders, and sequenced the CHIKV envelope glycoprotein genes, known determinants of vector host
range. As expected for Asian lineage CHIKV strains, these isolates lacked known Aedes albopictus–adaptive mutations.
All the Colombian strains were closely related to those from the Virgin Islands, Saint Lucia, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and
Brazil, consistent with a single, point-source introduction from the southeast Asia/Pacific region. Two substitutions in
the E2 and E1 envelope glycoprotein genes were found in the Colombian strains, especially E1-K211E involving a resi-
due shown previously to affect epistatically the penetrance of the E1-A226V A. albopictus–adaptive substitution. We
also identified two amino acid substitutions unique to all American CHIKV sequences: E2-V368A and 6K-L20M. Only
one codon, 6K-47, had a high nonsynonymous substitution rate suggesting positive selection.
INTRODUCTION
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus
that belongs to the Togaviridae family, genus Alphavirus.
The viral genome has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA
of approximately 11.5 kb, and encodes four nonstructural pro-
teins (nsP1–4) and three main structural proteins (capsid, E2
and E1 envelope glycoproteins) in the genomic and a sub-
genomic RNA, respectively.1 The envelope glycoproteins
include a fusion peptide (E1) and the ligand for receptor-
mediated endocytic viral entry (E2); these proteins are known
to be major determinants of evolutionary adaption and dis-
semination of this arbovirus.2–4 The alphavirus E2 protein
consists of three distinct domains, A, B, and C, and E2 has
been previously implicated as the major target of the protec-
tive host immune response.5,6 Domain B is believed to code
for the tip of alphavirus spikes and to interact with cellular
receptors. It includes neutralizing epitopes.7
In humans, CHIKV causes an acute undifferentiated febrile
syndrome, called chikungunya fever (CHIKF), character-
ized by high fever, headache, back pain, myalgia, and poly-
arthralgia among other signs and symptoms.8 In its original,
sylvatic cycle in the African continent, mosquitoes from the
Aedes genus transmit CHIKV among nonhuman primates.9
However, in urban environments of Africa, Asia, and
Europe, and now in the New World, CHIKV circulates effi-
ciently between anthropophilic mosquitoes, principally Aedes
aegypti, and humans to infect a large number of persons and
cause explosive outbreaks. However, in tropical and subtrop-
ical countries, CHIKV can be difficult to diagnose based
only on signs and symptoms mainly due to the presence of
dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and other
viruses associated with acute undifferentiated febrile syn-
dromes, such as St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), Venezuelan
equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), West Nile virus (WNV),
Mayaro virus (MAYV), Oropouche virus (OROV), and more
recently Zika virus (ZIKV).10–14
CHIKV was first isolated in the 1950s in Tanzania (east
Africa), and since has spread to the Indian Ocean basin, Asia
(India, Sri Lanka, and southeast Asia in 200515,16), Europe
(Italy, 200717 and France, 201018 and 201419), and the Americas
in 2013.20,21 Since the original discovery of CHIKV in Africa,
there have been large outbreaks in the Asian and American
continents involving millions of human cases, resulting in major
interest in the news media and scientific journals.
Colombia has been the second most affected nation during
the current CHIKV outbreak in the Americas (second only
to the Dominican Republic, which had over 500,000 sus-
pected cases between 2014 and 2015),22,23 with more than
450,000 suspected cases,24 most only diagnosed based on
signs and symptoms. Thus, these two countries represent
more than half of the case burden CHIKV has imposed in the
Americans.25 According to the national health agency (Instituto
Nacional de Salud [INS]), there have been 73 CHIKV-
related deaths in Colombia, seven of them involving coinfec-
tion with DENV.24
Initial phylogenetic analyses of CHIKV revealed three
main lineages or clades: the west African and east/central/
South Africa (ECSA) enzootic lineages, and the Asian
endemic/epidemic lineage.26 However, beginning in 2005,
an ECSA lineage strain spread into the Indian Ocean
basin from Kenya and also to India, giving rise to the new
epidemic Indian Ocean lineage (IOL) characterized by
human-mosquito transmission. This emergence was quickly
accompanied by an E1-A226V substitution that dramatically
enhanced transmission by Aedes albopictus.4 Subsequently,
this IOL evolved into at least four sublineages, each accom-
panied by further adaptive evolution for this new vector
involving E2 substitutions.27 However, epistatic interactions
within the E1 protein restrict the expression of the E1-
A226V mutation in the Asian lineage, suggesting that the

 strains of this lineage now circulating in the Americas will be
principally transmitted by A. aegypti.28 The CHIKV land-
scape in the Americas was further complicated by the arrival
of an ECSA strain directly from Africa in 2014.29 The poten-
tial for efficient A. albopictus transmission by this strain
remains unknown.
The first CHIKF cases in Colombia were detected
between June and August 2014. By September 2014, the
INS reported 10 autochthonous cases diagnosed clinically in
three municipalities of Bolivar Department (on the Atlantic
coast), including the major tourist destination of Cartagena
(Figure 1).30 The presence of dengue fever (DENF) in
many areas of Colombia probably masked the first CHIKF
cases, although polyarthralgia and rash raised suspicion
of CHIKF.31 Known CHIKV vectors are present nearly
throughout Colombia; A. aegypti is abundant in most of
regions, and A. albopictus also occurs in the Amazon, Andean,
and Pacific regions, but not in the Atlantic, where the sam-
ples of this study came from (Figure 1).32
To determine the source and patterns of initial spread of
CHIKV in Colombia, we attempted to isolate, amplify via
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),
and genetically analyze CHIKV from over 30 sera obtained
from febrile patients from the northwestern area of the coun-
try as part of dengue surveillance. To determine the main
CHIKV lineages circulating and to identify vector-adaptive
mutations described previously, we sequenced the E1 and E2
glycoprotein genes from all strains detected to help determine
the public health risks to predict the future spread of the out-
break. Viral sequences of 14 CHIKV isolates analyzed from
Sincelejo (Sucre Department, Colombia) were members of the
Asian lineage and, consistent with previous evidence, none

 had known A. albopictus–adaptive mutations,9 consistent with
prior predictions for the Asian lineage.28
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study subjects. Thirty-two acute sera from patients with
an undifferentiated febrile syndrome compatible with DENF
were collected between October 18, 2014, and January 15,
2015, from Sincelejo (Sucre Department, Figure 1). Sucre
ranks third or fourth among Colombian provinces in the
number of suspected CHIKV cases, with over 20,000 between
2014 and 2015, about a 10th of the national total.33
Ethics statement. The study was funded by a grant from
Colciencias (code 112954531519, “Eco-epidemiological sur-
veillance system of Dengue Virus in the department of
Sucre”). In compliance with the international regulations,
the study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Uni-
versity of Sucre Bioethics Committee. Written consent was
obtained from patients 18 years of age and older; for patients
younger than 18 years, written consent was obtained from a
parent or legal guardian.
Cell culture and virus isolation. Initially, each serum
(100 μL) from Sincelejo was inoculated into two 12.5-cm2
plastic flasks containing cultures of Vero E6 (African Green
Monkey, ATCC CCL-81, Manassas, VA) and C6/36 (A.
albopictus mosquito, ATCC CRL-1660) cells. Cell lines were
propagated at 37°C (Vero) or 28°C (C6/36) in 5% CO2 envi-
ronment. Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium containing
2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), sodium pyruvate (1 mM),
penicillin (100 IU/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL) was
the maintenance medium. Cultures that developed cytopathic
effects (CPEs) were tested using an indirect immunofluores-
cence antibody test (IFAT). On observation of CPE, or 6 days
after inoculation if none was observed, cells were removed
and placed on 12-well glass spot-slides for microscopic exami-
nation after drying and fixation in cold acetone. A standard
indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was performed using
hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid (HMAF) against a panel of
local arbovirus (DENV-1–4, SLEV, CHIKV, YFV, MAYV,
VEEV, and WNV), followed by the addition of fluorescein-
conjugated goat antimouse IgG, as previously described.34,35
The IFA tests were performed by using HMAF at dilutions of
1:10 and 1:20 and a commercial fluorescein isothiocyanate–
conjugated goat antimouse IgG (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).
Uninfected cells tested with the HMAF and the IgG anti-
mouse antibody were used as negative controls.

sequencing. RNA was extracted from the supernatants of
infected C6/36 cells using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
following the manufacturer’s protocols, and was used to syn-
thesize complementary DNA using the Super Script III First
Strand kit (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA), and random hexamers
following the manufacturer’s protocol. The Phusion® High-
Fidelity PCR Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) was
then used to generate three overlapping PCR amplicons
from E1/E2 regions, which were then purified using the
QIAquick® PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
Primer sequences are available from the authors on request.
The three sets of primers were used to amplify three
overlapping fragments of approximately 600–700 nucleotides
(nt). This integrated amplicon spanned 1,679 nt and allowed
for the analysis of approximately 57% of E2, 100% of 6K,
and 59% of E1. These segments were carefully chosen to
analyze the most significant adaptive mutations that have
impacted CHIKV evolution during historic outbreaks.27,28
We used a CHIKV RNA obtained from Vero cells infected
with a genetically distinct viral isolate from Puerto Rico as a
positive control. As negative controls, we used RNase-free
water for the RT and an aliquot of this RT as a negative con-
trol for the PCR.
Sequences were generated using a BigDye Terminator
v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). The products of the sequencing reactions were purified
using a 96-well plate format (Performa DTR v3 96-well short
plates; EdgeBio, Gaithersburg, MD), and then analyzed on
a 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequence
products were analyzed and edited using Sequencher 5.3 for
Sanger Sequencing Analysis (Gene codes Corporation, Ann
Arbor, MI). The sequences were deposited in the GenBank
database under accession nos. KU518330–KU518343.
Phylogenetic analysis. We used MEGA 6.06 (Molecular Evo-
lutionary Genetics Analysis, Arizona State University, Tempe,
AZ) for most sequence analyses, and the MrBayes 3.2.2
(available at http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/) for Bayesian
studies.36 Partial nucleotide sequences of E2/6K/E1 genes
(genome positions 9,064–10,742) of 14 Colombian isolates
and 49 homologous sequences from GenBank were aligned
using the Muscle algorithm (available at http://www.drive5.com/
muscle/) implemented in MEGA. Strains belonging to all previ-
ously described CHIKV lineages (west African as outgroup,
ECSA, IOL, and Asian) were included to maximize context.
The maximum likelihood (ML) method used with the
Kimura-2 parameter model37 and a discrete Gamma distri-
bution was selected to model evolutionary rate differences
among sites (3 categories [+ G, parameter = 0.30]). The
E2/E1 sequences were analyzed using 63 CHIKV strains
(49 from GenBank and 14 unique Colombian strains chosen
from the 32 we amplified and sequenced, excluding identical
sequences). We used 1,000 bootstrap replicates to determine
the robustness of groupings.
The Bayesian analysis for the E2/E1 gene segments was
run with the same 63 sequences, 3 million generations and
using the K2 + G model of nucleotide substitution and
gamma distributed rate variation in the MrBayes 3.2.2.
To test for adaptive evolution in the sequences included
in the dataset, we used the Fast Unconstrained Bayesian
Approximation (FUBAR),38 a program that uses a Markov
chain Monte Carlo routine to estimate the synonymous (dS)
and nonsynonymous (dN) substitutions rates and the poste-
rior probabilities of selection pressures at individual codons
in a Bayesian context.
RESULTS
Human subjects. The 32 patients from Sincelejo (Sucre
Department) represented a very wide range of ages from 5 days
to over 40 years old. Most patients showed the same common
features described in previous CHIKF outbreaks including the
Colombian epidemic.39 Of the 32 patients, 26 experienced
fever (81%), 23 rash (72%), 21 arthralgia (65%), 19 myalgia
(59%), and 11 headache (34%). These results were similar to
others previously described in the literature.4,18,21

 identified by IFA using a set of antibodies for arboviruses from
different families (Bunyaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae,
Orthomyxoviridae, Reoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae; data not
shown). The VectorTest®, a rapid assay for CHIKV antigen
detection (Vector Test Systems, Thousand Oaks, CA), was
also performed on culture fluid from the IFAT-positive cul-
tures to confirm these results (data not shown).
RT-PCR products and sequence analysis. The 32 samples
were confirmed as CHIKV positive by RT-PCR using three
sets of primers covering the E2/6K/E1 genes (not shown).
Sanger sequences of the three overlapping amplicons were
concatenated to yield 1,679 nt located at genome positions
9,064–10,742. The Colombian sequences varied only by 0–2 nt
(0.00–0.12%) in this genome region, and differed from other
American strains by up to 3 nt (0.18%).
Phylogenies were estimated with maximum likelihood
Bayesian and neighbor-joining analyses. Only minor differ-
ences were observed in terminal groupings with different
methods. ML phylogenies are provided in Figure 2 (other
analyses are provided as Supplemental Figures 1 and 2).

GenBank library and representing the major lineages: east/central/South Africa (ECSA) (gave rise in 2004 to the Indian Ocean lineage) and
Asian. This analysis was rooted with west African lineage as an outgroup. The evolutionary history was inferred by the maximum likelihood
method, using 1,000 replications of bootstrap and based on the Kimura-2 parameter with gamma distributed rate variation among sites (K2 +
G). The analysis was based on 1,679 nucleotides representing genome positions 9,064–10,742 that includes 57% of E2 and 59% of the E1 gene
as well as all of 6K/TF. Colombian isolates sequenced in this study are indicated by black triangles. The recently described Brazilian ECSA line-
age is labeled with a black dot. Isolates from Kenya and Reunion Island that gave rise to the Indian Ocean lineage are labeled with black dia-

RODAS AND OTHERS
 According to the ML analysis, the Sincelejo Colombia
samples were closely related to each other in a para-
phyletic group with other Caribbean, Central and South
American sequences within the Asian lineage (Figure 2).
It was not surprising to find such genetic similarity in the
Sincelejo strains because all were obtained within the same
municipality during a short period of time (October 2014–
January 2015).
The closest viral strains to our Colombian isolates were
from the 2014 outbreak in the Virgin Islands, Saint Lucia,
Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Brazil. The clade corresponding
to the American outbreak was well supported (100% boot-
strap), and closely related to other sequences from previous
isolates from Asia (KJ689453 Micronesia 2013, AB860301
Philippines 2013, KC488650 Philippines 2012, and KF318729
China 2012), consistent with a point-source introduction from
one of the later regions.
Cocirculation of two different CHIKV lineages has been
reported in Brazil since 2014 (Figure 2, accession nos.
KP164567 and KP164572, the latter labeled with a black
circle).29 However, we only detected the Asian lineage in our
samples. When we examined our sequences for A. albopictus–
adaptive mutations identified previously (Table 1),2,27,41,48,51
none was found. However, when we examined the E1 and E2
acid-sensitive domains involved in A. albopictus–adaptive
evolution, two substitutions were found: E2-L248F and E1-
K211E, present in all Colombian strains. E2-L248F was
described in 2012 CHIKV strains from the Philippines that
are part of the B3 cosmopolitan Asian CHIKV clade derived
from a common ancestor dated to 2003.45 All Philippines
CHIKV strains isolated from the nationwide 2012 out-
breaks within this clade, as well as other CHIKV isolates
from China (2012), Micronesia (2013), and the Caribbean
(2013–2014) have E2-248F. On the basis of its proximity to
known vector-adaptive substitutions, E2-L248F deserves fur-
ther study.
E2 L248F and E1-K211E were already present in some
Asian strains before CHIKV arrival to the Americas, so it is
not likely to be associated with adaptive evolution in the
Americas. However, we did identify two amino acid substitu-
tions that are unique to all American CHIKV sequences in
our dataset: E2-V368A and 6K-L20M (Table 1). In addition,
we also found 4 dN substitutions in one Colombian sequence
each: E2-H351R, 6K-A47S, 6K- F48L, and E1-L133F, which
were present in strains SI190, SI246, SI256, and SI258, respec-
tively. The E2-V371L substitution, shared by recent Asian line-
age CHIKV strains but not mapped to A. albopictus–adaptive
envelope protein domains was also identified in all of our
Colombian strains (Table 1).
The results of the analysis of adaptive evolution run in
FUBAR showed that in most codons the estimated dS sub-
stitution rate was higher than the dN rate (dN < dS) with
285 of 559 codons exhibiting evidence of negative (purifying)
selection with posterior probabilities > 0.9. Only one site,
codon 6K-47, had a significantly higher dN rate (dN/dS =
5.74; Table 1), suggesting positive selection with a posterior
probability of 0.92 and a Bayes factor of 44.8 (not shown).
This substitution therefore deserves further study.
DISCUSSION
According to our results, the Colombian CHIKV strains,
like others found in the Caribbean and South America,3
belong to the Asian lineage that lacks A. albopictus–adaptive
mutations due to the epistatic constraint imposed by E1-T98
(Table 1).28 Nevertheless, tourism and other aspects of
globalization may still intervene to bring the IOL to the
Americas where A. albopictus is widespread and abundant.52
In the meantime, possible implications of the unique E2-
L248F substitutions found in Colombia, as well as the E1-
K211E we observed (Table 1), the latter which corresponds
to the IOL sublineage 2,27 should be studied using reverse

CHARACTERIZATION OF COLOMBIAN CHIKV STRAINS
 genetic approaches to determine whether they represent
vector-adaptive evolution of CHIKV in the Americas. Com-
plete genomic sequences from different regions and times
in the Colombian territory are also needed to further define
the origin of the index case and the port of entry for the
Colombian outbreak.
Regarding the origin of the current CHIKF Colombian
outbreak, our results support a recent analysis of the transcon-
tinental movement of the Asian genotype.53 The Colombian
strains showed a very close identity between two isolates
from Micronesia (accession nos. KJ451622 and KJ451623)
and a CHIKV isolate from Virgin Islands (accession no.
KJ451624, the same strain used in our analysis); these strains
differ by only 18–19 nt.53 Lanciotti and Valadere also showed
that two CHIKV isolates from Philippines, 2012 (accession
no. KC488650) and China-Zhejiang, 2012 (accession no.
KF318729), both strains included in our analysis, are strongly
supported sisters in this Asian subclade, and concluded that
the CHIKV strain from the Caribbean could have originated
from strains recently circulating in China, the Philippines,
or Micronesia.53
Concerning the two amino acid substitutions that are
unique to all American CHIKV sequences in our dataset,
E2-V368A and 6K-L20M (Table 1), they had been recently
described by a Mexican group in all the American strains
that arrived to this country and belonged to the Asian geno-
type that was also detected in Virgin Islands.44
On the other hand, the search for positive selection identi-
fied amino acid position 6K-47 as a likely candidate. In this
polymorphic site, most sequences of west African and ECSA
genotypes exhibit an A (alanine) that changes to T (threonine)
in the branch leading to the Asian genotype (Figure 2); how-
ever, it is valine in Ivory Coast 1993, isoleucine in India 1973
and serine in Si246 Colombia 2014 (not shown). Whether this
variability represents adaptation to different host environ-
ments or it is just the result of random genetic drift should
be tested in larger datasets or in a reverse genetic system.
During 2014, 106,763 suspected CHIKF cases occurred in
Colombia, the vast majority unconfirmed by laboratory diag-
nosis.54 There are no specific treatments available for CHIKF;
accurate diagnosis is important to improve understanding of
CHIKF epidemiology and to rule out DENV infection,
which is more often life threatening. Colombia has reported
73 deaths attributed to CHIKV infection since the beginning
of the outbreak in 2014, for a case-fatality rate of 0.016%.
This rate is lower than those from previous outbreaks in
Reunion Island and India, where rates as high as 0.1%
and 4.9%, respectively, were reported.55,56 Nevertheless, the
Colombian burden of CHIKF in terms of disability-adjusted
life years and the cost of treatment should be estimated along
with studies throughout the Americas to determine if the
Asian CHIKV lineage differs from the IOL in virulence.57–60
Infections in Colombia with CHIKV could also be influenced
by the presence of other pathogens. The alphaviruses MAYV
and CHIKV, closely related in the Semliki Forest complex,
could cross-protect to some degree.13,29 The former virus circu-
lates enzootically in forested regions throughout the Amazon
Basin, probably including Colombia. Coinfection of CHIKV
with DENV, MAYV, and ZIKV in Colombia also deserves
surveillance and further study.24 Other unrecognized viral
and bacterial diseases that typically remain undiagnosed
(OROV, and Leptospira and Rickettsia bacteria, among
others), could also cause coinfections during major CHIKF
epidemics with altered pathogenesis.
