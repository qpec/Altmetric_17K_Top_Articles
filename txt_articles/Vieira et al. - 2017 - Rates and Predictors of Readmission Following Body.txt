Abstract
Background: Hospital readmissions can be a major contributor to increased healthcare costs and are a salient current topic in healthcare. There is a 
paucity of large, prospective studies that evaluate rates and risk factors of readmission within the aesthetic subset of plastic surgery.
Objectives: The authors propose to determine the rates of unplanned readmission following body contouring procedures and to analyze the 
predictors associated with it.
Methods: The 2011 and 2012 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Database was queried for body contouring procedures using the 
appropriate Current Procedural Terminology codes. The rate of unplanned readmission, preoperative risk factors, comorbidities, and medical and surgical 
postoperative complications data were analyzed using multivariate regression models to determine predictors of readmission after these procedures.
Results: We identified 5100 patients who underwent body contouring procedures, of which 142 (2.8%) experienced an unplanned readmission. For-
ty-eight per cent of readmitted patients experienced at least one surgical complication, and 23.9% experienced at least one medical complication. Multi-
variate regression analyses identified several independent predictors of unplanned readmission: increasing age (odds ratio [OR] 1.018 per year, P = 0.039), 
bleeding disorders (OR 3.674, P = 0.039), increased operative time (each additional hour conferring a 20% increased risk), surgical complications (OR 
19.179, P < 0.001), and medical complications (OR 10.240, P < 0.001).
Conclusions: The unplanned readmission rate for body contouring procedures is low overall (2.8%). We identified age, bleeding disorders, op-
erative duration, and postoperative complication as independent risk factors for unplanned readmission. These data can help guide preoperative risk 
stratification and future interventions in high-risk patient populations.

Hospital readmissions are a topic of healthcare policy and 
practice reform as they contribute to increased healthcare 
costs.1-3 Identifying benchmarks and predictors of readmis-
sion is particularly important in aesthetic surgery, as the 
elective nature allows ample time for appropriate patient 
selection, counseling, and preoperative risk optimization. 
Moreover, the patient bears full responsibility for the cost 
of their aesthetic procedure and readmission after aes-
thetic surgery can have significant financial ramifications

for patients. Of all postoperative events, unplanned 
readmission has been shown to result in the greatest 
detriment to the immediate quality of life and financial 
health of patients, costing an estimated US$35,637 per 
readmission.3-6
Rates of readmission following reconstructive plastic 
surgery have been shown to vary from 1.94% for outpa-
tient procedures7 to 7.11% for inpatient procedures,8 with 
an overall rate of 4.7%.9 Importantly, there is a paucity of 
large, prospective studies that evaluate rates and risk fac-
tors of readmission within the increasingly prevalent aes-
thetic subset of plastic surgery. Aesthetic procedures have 
increased by over 111% since 2000, and body contouring 
accounts for a significant portion of these surgeries, with 
over 396,000 such surgeries performed in 2015.10
As the number of aesthetic procedures continues to 
grow, readmission should be minimized through proper 
patient selection and preoperative risk optimization. 
Robust outcomes data have the potential to develop pre-
ventative measures through identification of preopera-
tive predictors of readmission on a nationwide scale. The 
American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality 
Improvement Program (NSQIP) began capturing 30-day 
readmission data in 2011, allowing the opportunity to 
examine unplanned readmission in the largest nationwide 
cohort of body contouring procedures to date. Such data 
may delineate high-risk subgroups and specific areas for 
improvement, potentiating a reduction in readmission 
events, downstream cost-containment, and improved 
patient care.
Thus, the purpose of this study is twofold: (1) to identify 
the rates of 30-day unplanned readmission following body 
contouring procedures; and (2) to enumerate the risk fac-
tors that predict unplanned readmission using a validated 
surgical outcomes database. We feel that such information 
will facilitate nuanced decision-making conversations with 
patients who are considering elective surgery and allow 
for more data-driven application of supplemental cosmetic 
surgery insurance programs.
METHODS
Data Source
We performed a retrospective analysis of 986,034 patients 
in the 2011 and 2012 NSQIP registry, a validated, risk-ad-
justed, outcomes-based program used to measure and 
improve the quality of surgical care. The database search 
was conducted in April 2016. Details of the program and 
definitions of the variables collected in the database can 
be found at the program’s website (http://site.acsnsqip.
org). The data collection methods for NSQIP have been 
previously discussed in detail.11,12 In brief, trained research 
nurses at over 400 institutions independently abstract data 
using a systematic sampling of surgical operations.
According to this protocol, 240 Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996-compliant vari-
ables are prospectively collected for each encounter within 
the dataset. These data include patient demographics, 
baseline comorbidities, clinical characteristics, laboratory 
values, and 30-day postoperative complications. Notably, 
NSQIP introduced 2 new variables concerning readmis-
sion into the 2011 data set. To ensure a full 30-day fol-
low up period for all encounters, patients are contacted 
by phone call or letter after discharge. Collected data are 
subject to random audits, providing a high-quality, stan-
dardized database that has a demonstrated disagreement 
rate of less than 1.8% for program variables.13 We also 
classified cases by the total number of contouring proce-
dures received and the concurrent use of suction-assisted 
lipectomy. Institutional review board approval was not 
required, and the Declaration of Helsinki was used to 
guide ethical principles.
Ethical Approval
Deidentified patient information is freely available to all 
institutional members who comply with the American 
College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement 
Program (NSQIP) Data Use Agreement. The Data Use 
Agreement implements the protections afforded by the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 
1996.
Patient Population
Patients who underwent body contouring procedures in 
2011 and 2012 (n = 7004) were identified using Current 
Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. CPT codes for pan-
niculectomy (15 
830), mastopexy (19 
316), reduction 
mammoplasty (19 
318), and suction-assisted lipectomy 
(15 
876-79), as well as contouring of the leg, thigh, but-
tocks, hip, and arm (15 
832-36) were included. Patients 
with missing preoperative information and those who 
underwent concurrent procedures other than those speci-
fied (ie, hysterectomy and abdominoplasty) were excluded 
from the analysis.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was unplanned 30-day readmission. 
The new NSQIP variable “readmission” is defined as all-
cause readmission to the same or another hospital for any 
reason within 30 days of the index operation. The variable 
“unplanned readmission” is defined as readmission to the 
same or another hospital for a postoperative occurrence

likely related to the principle surgical procedure. We uti-
lized the “unplanned readmission” variable to calculate 
readmission rates and provide a more focused investiga-
tion into the predictors of procedure-related readmission. 
The readmissions data in the NSQIP participant use file 
have been previously validated and shown to accurately 
capture unplanned readmission events.14
Secondary outcomes included overall morbidity, surgi-
cal complications, and medical complications. These vari-
ables were defined by combining NSQIP variables. Overall, 
30-day morbidity was defined as the presence of one or 
more surgical or medical complication. Surgical compli-
cation was defined as having one or more of the follow-
ing postoperative adverse events: superficial surgical-site 
infection, deep surgical-site infection, organ/space surgi-
cal-site infection, wound disruption/dehiscence, or graft/
prosthesis failure. Medical complication was defined as 
having one or more of the following postoperative adverse 
events: pneumonia, unplanned intubation, pulmonary 
embolism, failure to wean from ventilator, renal insuffi-
ciency, progressive renal failure, urinary tract infection, 
stroke, coma, peripheral neurologic deficiency, cardiac 
arrest, myocardial infarction, bleeding requiring a trans-
fusion, deep venous thrombosis, and sepsis/septic shock.
Risk-Adjusted Factors
Preoperative variables collected by NSQIP that were 
tracked as potential confounders include demographic 
data, medical comorbidities, as well as operative char-
acteristics. Patient demographics collected include age, 
body mass index (BMI), sex, and race. Clinical character-
istics included inpatient/outpatient status, prior operation 
within 30 days, and American Society of Anesthesiologists 
(ASA) physical status.
General comorbidities include diabetes mellitus, 
chronic steroid use, acute renal failure, dialysis, hemi-
plegia, ascites, esophageal varices, disseminated cancer, 
open wound infection, bleeding disorders (vitamin K defi-
ciency, hemophilias, thrombocytopenia, chronic anticoag-
ulation therapy), preoperative transfusion, chemotherapy 
within 30 days, radiotherapy within 90 days, and sepsis. 
Pulmonary risk factors were a history of chronic pulmo-
nary obstructive disease (COPD), ventilator dependence, 
current pneumonia, and dyspnea. Cardiac risk factors 
included a history of hypertension, myocardial infarction, 
heart failure, angina, previous cardiac surgery or percu-
taneous coronary intervention, and revascularization or 
amputation for peripheral vascular disease. Neurologic 
risk factors included prior transient ischemic attack, 
cerebrovascular accident, central nervous system tumor, 
coma, paraplegia, quadriplegia status, and impaired 
sensorium. Alcohol use, defined as more than 2 drinks 
per day, as well as smoking status were also tracked as 
behavioral risk factors. Operative characteristics included 
wound classification, resident involvement, number of 
procedures undergone in encounter, and operative time 
in minutes.
Statistical Analysis
The identified patient population was separated into 2 
groups: those who experienced unplanned readmission 
and those who did not. Patient demographics, risk factors, 
and 30-day complication profiles were tracked for readmit-
ted and nonreadmitted patients. Pearson’s chi-square test 
and one-way ANOVA tests were used to evaluate categor-
ical and quantitative variables, respectively. Readmission 
rates were calculated for suction-assisted lipectomy, con-
touring of extremities, trunk, and breast.
Multivariate logistic regression analyses were uti-
lized to determine predictors of unplanned readmission. 
Variables with ≥10 event occurrences showing prediction 
of unplanned readmission at a significance level of ≤0.20 
on initial bivariate analysis were used as independent 
variables in the multivariate logistic regression model.15 
Additionally, C-statistics for discrimination and Hosmer-
Lemeshow (HL) tests for calibration were computed to 
assess the goodness of fit. All tests were two-tailed and 
statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. All analy-
ses were performed using SPSS, version 20 (Chicago, IL).
RESULTS
A total of 5100 patients who underwent body contouring 
procedures were isolated from the 2011 to 2012 NSQIP 
database of which 142 (2.8%) experienced an unplanned 
readmission. Ninety-six per cent of the identified patient 
population was female with a mean age of 44.5 years 
(range, 18-83 years) Demographic and preoperative char-
acteristics of readmitted patients differed significantly from 
those not readmitted (Table 1). Univariate analysis of the 
data show that readmitted patients were older (49.9 years 
vs 44.3 years, P < 0.001), heavier (35.5 kg/m2 vs 31.0 kg/
m2, P < 0.001), and had higher rates of diabetes, dysp-
nea, hypertension, and bleeding disorders (Table 1, all 
P < 0.01). When comparing operative characteristics 
(Table 2), results showed that unplanned readmission was 
more common in inpatient cases (P < 0.001) and with 
patients of higher ASA class (P < 0.001). Operative time in 
the readmitted cohort was, on average, 13.8 minutes longer 
than the nonreadmitted cohort (P = 0.026). Interestingly, 
rates of readmission did not significantly differ with con-
comitant liposuction (P = 0.063). Smoking, alcohol use, 
chronic steroid use, and prior operation within 30 days did 
not differ between cohorts.

Overall 30-day morbidity was relatively rare, with 346 
patients (6.8%) experiencing any perioperative morbidity. 
Superficial surgical site infection was the most common 
complication, with 179 total incidences (3.5%). Medical 
complications were also rare, occurring in only 2.4% of 
cases. The most common medical complication was postop-
erative blood transfusion, with 74 total instances (1.5%). Of 
the 5100 patients, 101 (2.0%) returned to the operating room 
within 30 days of the index operation. A complete complica-
tion profile for the study cohort is available in Table 3.
Of the 142 readmitted patients, 62% had at least one 
recorded 30-day complication compared to only 5.2% 
of patients in the nonreadmitted cohort (P < 0.001). 
Specifically, 48.5% of readmitted patients experienced at 
least one surgical complication, and 23.9% experienced at 
least one medical complication. These rates are significantly

higher than the 3.7% and 1.8% of nonreadmitted patients 
who experienced a surgical or medical complication, respec-
tively. Moreover, readmitted patients were more likely to 
experience multiple complications, when compared to non-
readmitted patients (16.9% vs 0.3%, P < 0.001).
Risk-adjusted multivariate regression analyses identi-
fied several independent predictors of unplanned read-
mission. Of the preoperative variables, increasing age 
(odds ratio [OR] 1.018 per year, P = 0.039) and bleeding 
disorders (OR 3.674, P = 0.039) were found to be inde-
pendently associated with readmission. Additionally, 
increasing operative time was also found to be associ-
ated with readmission, with each hour conferring a 20% 
increased risk. Finally, patients with a surgical compli-
cation were over 19 times as likely to be readmitted (OR 
19.179, P < 0.001) and those with medical complica-
tions were over 10 times as likely to be readmitted (OR 
10.240, P < 0.001). Table 4 displays the results of the 
multivariate logistic regression.
The most common area of contouring was the breast, 
with 3997 patients undergoing either reduction mam-
moplasty or mastopexy. Contouring of the abdomen, 
hips, and/or buttocks was performed in 1277 patients, 
while 56 patients underwent contouring of the extrem-
ities. Suction-assisted lipectomy was performed on 436 
patients (8.5%). Among these procedure types, contour-
ing of the extremities had the highest rate of readmission 
(10.7%), and suction-assisted lipectomy had the lowest 
rate (1.4%, Table 5). Contouring of the breast, the most 
common procedure overall, had a readmission rate of 
2.0%, while contouring of the trunk had a readmission 
rate of 5.5%.
Subgroup analysis of the data showed that 55.7% of 
patients underwent only one contouring procedure, while

36.1% underwent two procedures, 8.3% underwent three 
or more procedures (Table 2). Rates of readmission steadily 
increased with each concurrent procedure; from 2.4% for 
one additional procedure, to 2.6% with 2, to 3.3% with 3 
or more additional procedures (Table 5).
DISCUSSION
Unplanned hospital readmissions should be minimized 
to reduce costs and improve patient care. Though body 
contouring is considered a safe procedure, some risk is 
inherent to all surgery and these procedures have potential 
to cause significant postoperative morbidity.16-20 The cur-
rent study is the first large, prospectively collected, risk-ad-
justed study evaluating rates and predictors of readmission 
following body contouring procedures.
Using the 2011 to 2012 NSQIP database, which tracks 
unplanned readmission related to the index operation apart 
from all-cause readmission, we examined the readmission 
rates in the largest cohort of body contouring procedures

to date. Our analysis revealed that 2.8% of patients expe-
rienced an unplanned readmission within 30 days of the 
index body contouring procedure.
 Examination of the readmitted cohort demonstrated 
that they had significantly higher rates of comorbidities, 
perhaps due to their increased risk for postoperative com-
plication. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed 
that of these patient risk factors, increasing age and bleed-
ing disorders were significant predictors of unplanned 
readmission. Age is a known predictor of poor postoper-
ative outcomes in plastic surgery, but has not been previ-
ously identified as a predictor of readmission independent 
of postoperative complication.21,22
Age is a known risk factor for surgical complications 
and many interventions to improve outcomes in aging pop-
ulations have been studied, with a particular emphasis on 
discharge planning. One randomized controlled trial found 
that among elderly patients, those given detailed postop-
erative instructions and those with confirmed follow-up 
were less likely to require subsequent inpatient services.23 
Furthermore, a recent Cochrane review demonstrated that 
organized discharge planning in patients may reduce read-
mission rates in patients of older age.24 Together with our 
finding that increasing age was associated with unplanned 
readmission independent of postoperative complication, 
this suggests that in older patients, postoperative plans 
may be augmented to include overnight observation or 
closer outpatient follow up, and careful attention should 
be paid to instructions given at discharge.
The multivariate regression analysis also showed that 
patients with bleeding disorders are over 3 times as likely to 
be readmitted within 30 days. Fischer et al19 recently enu-
merated rates and predictors of complications in patients 
undergoing body contouring procedures and demonstrated 
that bleeding disorders predicted postoperative morbidity, 
supporting our finding that such disorders may predispose 
patients to inferior outcomes and increased risk for hos-
pital readmission downstream. Yet while the Fischer et al 
paper examined complications, our study, as described 
here, differs in that we looked at risk factors for readmis-
sion. Moreover, in an analysis of ambulatory plastic sur-
gery, Wilmalawansa et al determined that postoperative 
hematoma and postoperative hemorrhage were 2 of the 
most common diagnoses associated with hospital read-
mission, providing additional support for careful patient 
selection, and the importance of optimizing both preoper-
ative and postoperative hemodynamic status in a patients 
bleeding disorders.25
The implementation of a tailored approach designed to 
mitigate perioperative complications may wield a favor-
able downstream effect on patient outcomes, readmis-
sions, cost, and resource utilization. Based on our results 
that enumerate both advancing age and bleeding disorders 
as preoperative risk factors for unplanned readmission, we 
feel that such strategies begin with careful preoperative 
patient selection and counseling. Older patients and those 
with known vitamin K deficiency, hemophilia, thrombo-
cytopenia, or those on chronic anticoagulation therapy 
should be more stringently evaluated as candidates for elec-
tive procedures. Higher-risk patients may be better coun-
seled preoperatively for improved medical and procedural 
optimization prior to surgery, or in extreme cases, against 
body contouring procedures altogether. If physicians know 
what the risk factors are, they can prepare patients better 
for possible readmissions, especially if there are additional 
financial costs that are not covered by insurance.
With regard to operative and postoperative factors, 
increasing operative time, as well as both medical and 
surgical complications, were significantly more common 
within the readmitted cohort. Our finding that each hour

conferred a 20% increased risk corroborates the 2015 
study by Khavanin et al, which found that longer sur-
geries increased both hemostasis as well as the exposure 
of wounds to bacterial pathogens, 2of the most common 
reasons for readmission.26 This is especially important 
in combined procedures given that our analysis demon-
strated increasing rates of readmission with each addi-
tional procedure.
Notably in our study, 62% of readmissions were asso-
ciated with at least one surgical or medical complication, 
with superficial surgical site infection ranking as the most 
common singular postoperative complication. Bivariate 
analysis showed that both medical and surgical compli-
cations were significantly more common within the read-
mitted cohort. Corroborating this finding, multivariate 
logistic regression analysis demonstrated that patients 
with a medical complication were over 10 times as likely 
to be readmitted (OR 5.7-18.5, P < 0.001) and those with 
a surgical complication were more than 19 times as likely 
to be readmitted (OR 12.7-28.9, P = < 0.001). This find-
ing adds to an emerging volume of literature that sug-
gests postoperative complications are an important risk 
factor for readmission following surgical procedures.9,27-32 
These studies, along with the present study, emphasize 
the importance of early detection and appropriate man-
agement of perioperative complications, optimal outpa-
tient follow-up, and heightened awareness of higher risk 
cohorts.
The NSQIP “READMSUSPREASON1” variable was not 
believed to be reliable, and was therefore not used in 
this analysis. Importantly, irrespective of whether the 
complication occurred in the hospital or not, a patient 
with a complication has a greater chance of readmis-
sion. Therefore, they should not be hastily discharged 
due to the repercussions of bouncing back. In addition 
to more cautious discharge, patients with such compli-
cations may also necessitate closer follow up. Thus, our 
study aimed to point out preoperative and postoperative 
factors that may better elucidate the risk of readmission 
in order to allow for more cautious patient care in this 
subset. In addition, reducing readmissions would help 
avoid penalization for the hospital as well as decrease 
cost and morbidity for patients, particularly in cosmetic 
cases where insurance coverage is not a guarantee with 
readmission.
A recent series of studies have used the CosmetAssure 
to analyze a variety of clinical questions in plastic sur-
gery.33-38 The problem with CosmetAssure is that compli-
cations are only reported if they are severe enough to cause 
a payout to the patient, so for example a minor wound 
infection that does not cause hospitalization but instead 
only requires oral antibiotics will not show up in the 
CosmetAssure database. Readmission would likewise not 
show up in the CosmetAssure database if the readmission 
was covered by insurance. It is therefore not possible to 
compare our study to those using CosmetAssure since 
CosmetAssure only reports complications that pay out 
insurance, and minor complications are not reported. 
Furthermore, CosmetAssure does not capture as many risk 
factors as NSQIP.
The limitations of this study are largely related to the 
NSQIP database itself. Specifically, NSQIP tracks outcomes 
up to 30 days, and thus does not capture all complications 
or unplanned readmissions. NSQIP data examine patients 
who had their index operation performed at a nonof-
fice-based surgical facility. Most body contouring proce-
dures are performed in an office-based facility and they 
most likely have a lower comorbid presentation than 
patients presenting to academic hospitals or ambulatory 
surgery centers. This may create bias because patients 
obtaining body-contouring procedures in an office-based 
facility may be healthier and have fewer risk factors than 
the patients in the NSQIP dataset.
Large, national databases encompassing multiple insti-
tutions and institution types are well suited for studying 
infrequent events such as readmission after aesthetic sur-
gery due to the incomparable sample size, however they 
often lack granularity. It has been often noted that the 
database does not record all variables germane to plas-
tic surgery, (ie, seroma, hematoma, poor scarring, asym-
metry). Contributing reasons for readmission cannot be 
assessed. For example, it is impossible to discern whether 
a readmission was due to poor discharge planning or due 
to a complication that arose as an outpatient. Furthermore, 
unplanned readmission has only recently been added to 
the variables tracked by NSQIP, and additional years will 
continue to improve the quality of data.
CONCLUSIONS
Prevention of readmission is the central motivation 
behind measuring and predicting the likelihood of a 
patient being readmitted after hospital discharge. Our 
study identified age, bleeding disorders, operative dura-
tion, and postoperative complication as independent risk 
factors for unplanned readmission. Future work should 
implement and test interventions in high-risk patient 
populations. In addition, we identified superficial surgi-
cal site infection as the most common singular postoper-
ative complication. We hope that these results will serve 
as benchmark data regarding surgical site infections and 
their likely involvement in readmissions after body con-
touring procedures.
