Abstract: In 1996, the Board of Directors of the American Cancer Society (ACS) challenged the United States to reduce what
looked to be possible peak cancer mortality in 1990 by 50% by the year 2015. This analysis examines the trends in cancer mor-
tality across this 25-year challenge period from 1990 to 2015. In 2015, cancer death rates were 26% lower than in 1990 (32%
lower among men and 22% lower among women). The 50% reduction goal was more fully met for the cancer sites for which
there was enactment of effective approaches for prevention, early detection, and/or treatment. Among men, mortality rates
dropped for lung cancer by 45%, for colorectal cancer by 47%, and for prostate cancer by 53%. Among women, mortality rates
dropped for lung cancer by 8%, for colorectal cancer by 44%, and for breast cancer by 39%. Declines in the death rates of all
other cancer sites were substantially smaller (13% among men and 17% among women). The major factors that accounted for
these favorable trends were progress in tobacco control and improvements in early detection and treatment. As we embark on
new national cancer goals, this recent past experience should teach us that curing the cancer problem will require 2 sets of
actions: making new discoveries in cancer therapeutics and more completely applying those discoveries in cancer prevention
we have already made. CA Cancer J Clin 2016;66:359-369. V

Introduction
In 1996, the American Cancer Society (ACS) Board of Directors set an ambitious challenge goal for the country: to halve
what was thought to be a possible peak cancer mortality rate in 1990 by the year 2015.1 That ambitious goal was set after
their recognition that there was an apparent beginning of what would likely be a persistent down-turn in cancer mortality
rates in the United States because of favorable trends in tobacco cessation, cancer screening, and cancer treatment. In this
report, we summarize the trends in cancer mortality that occurred from 1990 to 2015 and discuss the factors that have con-
tributed to both successes and failures in reaching that goal. Then, we reflect on the process of goal-setting, with an eye
toward helping to make future national cancer goals more successful.
Trends in Cancer Mortality and Risk Factors
Across all cancer sites, the decline in mortality rates from 1990 to 2015 was 26% for the population of the United States
(32% among men and 22% among women) (Table 1).2 Cancer mortality rates declined over the 25-year period for lung can-
cer (45% among men and 8% among women), colorectal cancer (47% among men and 44% among women), breast cancer
(39% among women), and prostate cancer (53% among men). Declines for all other cancers apart from the 4 leading cancer
sites were substantially smaller (13% among men and 17% among women).
To put the 25-year cancer mortality trends from 1990 to 2015 into a broader historical perspective, the longer 85-year
trends from 1930 to 2015 are shown by sex in Figure 1 for the 4 leading cancer sites and for all cancer sites combined. The
downward trend in lung cancer began among men in about 1990, as did the downward trends for prostate cancer among
men and breast cancer among women. The downward trends in colorectal cancer mortality began much earlier, in about

*Cancer mortality data were obtained for the United States from the National Center for Health Statistics.2 Death rates were age-adjusted to the year 2000
standard population for each year from 1990 to 2014. The 2015 rates were estimated as a linear extrapolation of the trends from 2010 to 2014 (2009–2013
extrapolation for race/ethnicity-specific groups due to lack of ethnicity-specific denominator data for 2014).

 1980 among men and in about 1950 among women. The
downward trend in lung cancer among women did not
begin until 2005.
Trends in mortality for all cancer sites combined are
shown in Table 2 for subgroups defined by sex, age, and
race/ethnicity.2-9 Downward trends across all cancer sites
were steeper among men (32%) and among African Ameri-
cans (33%) but were less steep among men ages 80 years
and older (10%).
Trends in the major cancer risk factors for the years 1985
through 2013 are shown in Table 3.3-7 Over this time
period, there were persistent declines in tobacco use and
progress in the use of cancer early detection methods, but
there was a persistent increase in the prevalence of obesity,
a factor now known to increase incidence and mortality for
many cancer sites.10
Discussion
In the year 2015, cancer death rates were about 26% lower
in the United States than they were in 1990. Thus, the
United States achieved about one-half of the ACS chal-
lenge goal to reduce cancer mortality by 50% over that 25-
year period. For the leading cancer sites (lung, colorectal,
breast, and prostate), we came much closer to achieving the
50% mortality reduction goal. Here, we comment on the
factors that have led to these declines in cancer mortality,
and we discuss the challenges and opportunities we now
face to further reduce cancer mortality into the future.
Lung Cancer
The decline in lung cancer mortality of 45% among men
and 8% among women resulted almost entirely from
tobacco control. Lung cancer mortality began to decline
among men in 1990, but rates increased among women
throughout the 1990s before beginning to decline in about
2005. The sex differences in both the timing and the mag-
nitude of declines in lung cancer mortality are because of
sex differences in the time course of cigarette marketing,
use, and cessation.11 Tobacco use has been on the decline
in the United States since the 1960s, but the trajectory of
downward trends in cigarette smoking slowed in the 1990s,
now leaving about 1 of every 6 American adults as regular
cigarette smokers.12 After a period of relatively little change
in smoking uptake by youth, a steeper decline in regular
cigarette smoking by middle school and high school stu-
dents has occurred in recent years.13 The 27.5% smoking
prevalence among high school students in 1991 had
dropped to 9.2% by 2014.14 Although encouraging, this
recent decline has been accompanied by an increase in the
use of alternative nicotine-delivery products, such as
e-cigarettes, for which the balance of benefits versus risks
over the long term is unknown.15

 Despite the proven effectiveness of organized tobacco
control, only a few states have adequately funded tobacco-
control programs that meet minimal quality standards.16 In
fact, for the fiscal year 2016, only 5 states are funding their
tobacco-control programs at greater than 50% of the levels
recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention.16 In hindsight, the single most important missed
opportunity for cancer prevention throughout the 25-year
ACS challenge period may have occurred in the year 1998,
when the attorneys general from 46 states struck a deal
with US tobacco companies. That deal, the Master Settle-
ment Agreement, specified that, in exchange for cash pay-
ments to states from the tobacco companies of about $246
billion over 50 years, the states would halt all legal actions
against the tobacco industry.17 The Master Settlement
Agreement instituted several policies that have positively
contributed to tobacco control, but it contained no provi-
sions designating the cash payments to be used for state-
level tobacco control. Because most states chose to use their
tobacco settlement funds for general budget purposes, sub-
stantial variation now exists across the states in their appli-
cation of effective tobacco-control polices. The predictable
result of the interstate variation in tobacco control is inter-
state variation in both tobacco use and lung cancer mortal-
ity. For example, in 2013, both tobacco use and lung cancer
death rates were over twice as high in Kentucky than in
California (adult smoking prevalence, 26.5% vs 12.5%,
respectively; age-adjusted lung cancer mortality rate, 69.5
vs 32.1 per 100,000, respectively).12,18
The treatment of lung cancer is more effective at early
stages, but only a small proportion of lung cancers are cur-
rently detected early. In 2011, the National Lung Screening
Trial reported a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality
from annual low-dose computed tomographic lung screen-
ing after only 3 annual screens for smokers and former
smokers ages 55 to 74 years with at least a 30-pack-year
history.19 Many organizations, including the ACS, now
recommend
offering
lung
cancer
screening
to
such
patients.20 There has also been recent progress in lung can-
cer therapeutics.21 Although continued progress in lung
cancer treatment and early detection promises to make
future contributions to declining death rates from lung can-
cer, the biggest impact will come from more effective
tobacco control. Because tobacco use remains the single
most important preventable cause of cancer death, and
because the current interstate variation in tobacco control is
costing many lives each day, serious consideration should
be given to creating a more coherent and comprehensive
national approach to tobacco control in the United States.
Colorectal Cancer
Colorectal cancer mortality rates declined by 47% among
men and by 44% among women from 1990 to 2015. Colo-
rectal cancer mortality had been steadily declining for many
years before 1990, with longer and steeper declines among
women than men. Although the reasons for that difference
are not known, factors both in diet (more vegetable intake
and less red meat by women) and the use of menopausal
hormone treatment (MHT), which has been shown to
reduce colorectal cancer risk in women, may be part of the
reason.22 There has been important progress in treatment
for advanced colorectal cancer, and several lifestyle factors
in addition to dietary factors may have contributed to a
reduced risk of colorectal cancer, including being more

 physically active, not smoking, and using nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs.22 Because obesity increases colorectal
cancer risk, it is very likely that, without the obesity epi-
demic, the colorectal cancer mortality declines over the last
25 years would have been even steeper.23 The pace of colo-
rectal cancer mortality reduction will be increased in the
future, when the obesity epidemic is reversed.
The single most effective strategy to prevent deaths from
colorectal cancer is to prevent the disease by the identifica-
tion and removal of colorectal adenomas.24 Rates of endo-
scopic screening of the colorectum (especially colonoscopy)
have increased substantially over the past 25 years.25,26
That increase is due to a historic shift in social normaliza-
tion of talking about the colon. That social change resulted
from efforts by many organizations and individuals, includ-
ing network television personality Katie Couric, whose
screening messaging after her husband’s death from colo-
rectal cancer in 1998 created a measurable increase in colo-
noscopy rates during an era in which many other efforts
were also underway.27 Expanded coverage of colonoscopy
by Medicare in 2001 and increasing coverage by other
insurers then reduced financial barriers to colorectal cancer
screening, leading to particularly large increases in colono-
scopy screening rates during the 2000s.25,26 Regular stool
testing with methods sensitive for blood or for DNA with
mutations or abnormal methylation, followed by colono-
scopy for those testing positive, can also reduce colorectal
cancer mortality.24 Nonetheless, about 40% of US adults
ages 50 years and older still are not up to date for colorectal
screening.3 The current campaign to assure 80% of the US
population is properly screened for colorectal cancer by
2018 (the “80 by 2018” campaign) can further drive colo-
rectal cancer mortality downward into the future.28 Despite
this overall progress, substantial racial and geographic dis-
parities continue to exist for colorectal cancer mortality,
with blacks having about 35% higher colorectal cancer
death rates in 2013 than whites, and persons residing in the
lower Mississippi Delta having 40% higher death rates than
the remainder of the United States, differences caused by a
combination of inequalities in prevention, early detection,
and treatment.29
Breast Cancer
The 39% decline in breast cancer death rates among women
over the 25-year challenge period was a result of the com-
bined effects of increasing mammography and improved
treatment.30 Mammography rates increased steeply during
the 1980s and 1990s because of concerted efforts by many
organizations to increase awareness of the importance of
breast cancer early detection. Rates have been quite high,
but they plateaued in the 2000s because of reduced invest-
ments in mammography promotion to reach the most diffi-
cult populations, in concert with public debates about the
harms of screening and the optimal age to begin screen-
ing.31,32 As of 2014, about 25% of US women ages 50 years
and older had not had a mammogram within the prior
2 years.18
Improvements in treatment, particularly the advent of anti-
estrogen therapies and interventions to target human epider-
mal growth factor 2 (HER-2) and other cell-signaling
pathways, have substantially increased survival rates for breast
cancer.21,33 Tamoxifen, initially proven to reduce recurrence
and extend survival after mastectomy, was observed to also
reduce second primary cancers in the contralateral breast, a
prevention potential later confirmed in 1998 as a 50% reduc-
tion in breast cancer incidence.34 Despite that large potential
for breast cancer chemoprevention, tamoxifen has not been
used widely because of other adverse effects, nor has raloxi-
fene, another antiestrogen with similar breast cancer preven-
tive
effects
but
a
better
side-effect
profile.35
Future
approaches to breast cancer chemoprevention will likely
require agents with even fewer side effects if they are to be
widely used. Other treatment advances over this 25-year chal-
lenge period have included approaches to therapy that mini-
mize side effects of treatment, including sampling sentinel
lymph nodes for biopsy, thus substantially reducing the prob-
lem of lymphedema of the arm, and the use of molecular
profiling of tumors, providing better prognostic information
to allow more selective use of adjuvant chemotherapy.36,37
Although such advances have not had major impacts on can-
cer mortality, they have substantially improved other clinical
outcomes among women treated for breast cancer.
The favorable breast cancer mortality trends between 1990
and 2015 occurred in an era after unfavorable trends were
observed in both MHT use and obesity, 2 major risk factors
for breast cancer.23,38 The sudden reduction in MHT use
after publication of the Women’s Health Initiative trial find-
ings in 2001 helped to reduce the impact of MHT on breast
cancer incidence and mortality.38-40 The prevalence of MHT
use among US women ages 50 to 59 years dropped from
about 38% in 1999 to 2000 to 7% by 2009 and 2010.38 The
World Cancer Research Fund estimates that one-third of
breast cancers could be prevented by healthy behaviors,
including engaging in regular physical activity, not drinking
alcohol, and preventing obesity, and that obesity now accounts
for about 17% of breast cancers in the United States.41,42 It is
encouraging to see that the obesity epidemic in the United
States has been slowing in recent years, as stopping the head-
wind of obesity will contribute to future reductions in breast
cancer mortality.23 Since 1990, breast cancer mortality rates
have declined among both white and black women, but the
decline has been substantially steeper for white women, result-
ing in black women having about 39% higher breast cancer
mortality in 2013. The black-white mortality disparity has

 steadily grown rather than declined during the 25-year ACS
challenge goal period.43 Efforts to eliminate this disparity will
require additional research to understand the biological causes
of the black-white differences in breast cancer as well as addi-
tional efforts to remedy the social causes that present barriers
to primary prevention, high-quality breast cancer screening,
and treatment.44
Prostate Cancer
The 53% decline in prostate cancer mortality between 1990
and 2015 makes prostate cancer the only cancer site for
which the ACS challenge goal was reached. Therefore, it is
unfortunate that we must conclude that the reasons for this
decline are less certain than the reasons for declines in the
other cancer sites. This 25-year challenge period corre-
sponded with several simultaneous changes, including the
introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening
in the United States, changes in coding causes of death, the
use of PSA for assessing early stages of clinical cancer pro-
gression, and the increasing use of antihormonal treatments
for advanced stage prostate cancer.
The impact of PSA screening on prostate cancer mortal-
ity in the United States is unclear. PSA was approved for
clinical use as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in 1986.
PSA has never been officially approved for asymptomatic
screening, but it began to be used for that purpose in about
1988.9 Although “common sense” suggested that, with
increased detection of asymptomatic disease, there should
have been mortality benefits from PSA screening, the find-
ings of randomized, controlled trials have not consistently
supported that idea.45,46 The European Randomized Study
of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) demonstrated a
21% prostate cancer mortality benefit from annual PSA
screening, but that trial had structural differences in treat-
ments between the randomized arms.45 Even if 21% is a
valid estimate of the PSA screening benefit for prostate
cancer mortality, it is important to note that the difference
in prostate cancer mortality between the screened and con-
trol groups in the ERSPC did not emerge until after 10
years. That delay is too long to support the idea that the
advent of PSA screening seen in the United States in the
early 1990s (about 5% in 1990 and 30% in 1995) could
explain the initial steep phase of decline in prostate cancer
mortality in the United States from 1990 to 2000 as a PSA
screening effect.9 The American PSA screening trial (the
Prostate, Lung, Colon, and Ovary [PLCO] trial) found no
mortality benefit from annual PSA screening.46 The main
weakness of the PLCO PSA trial was substantial contami-
nation by PSA screening in the control arm. Despite that
contamination, the expected screening effect on prostate
cancer incidence was seen; however, after 13 years of
follow-up, there were 9% more deaths from prostate cancer
in the screened arm of the trial, suggesting little if any ben-
efit from PSA screening.46 The proportion of men being
screened with PSA is declining in the United States, princi-
pally because of the ACS recommendation against PSA
screening in the absence of shared decision making and a
recommendation for no PSA screening at all by the United
States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).47,48 The
balance of benefits and harms of PSA screening may favor-
ably change in the future if methods can be developed to
better distinguish small prostate cancers that are likely to
progress from those that are likely to remain indolent.
Changes in coding the underlying cause of death on death
certificates in the early years after the availability of PSA for
screening and diagnostics might have had a greater effect on
both the up-slope and the down-slope of the peak in pros-
tate cancer deaths seen near the beginning of the 25-year
challenge period.49 Also complicating the interpretation of
mortality trends is the use of PSA testing to monitor for dis-
ease progression after initial treatment, with the result of
trends for earlier intervention with antihormonal therapies.
Antihormonal therapies can produce both benefits of sup-
pressing prostate cancer growth but also harms of increased
mortality from cardiovascular causes.50 Both of those effects
would contribute to downward trends in prostate cancer-
specific death rates as use of that treatment increased. Other
prostate cancer therapies improved over the 25-year chal-
lenge period, including the increasing use of radical prosta-
tectomy for first-course treatment and the development of
radiation therapies that could deliver higher doses to the
prostate with lower doses to surrounding tissues.51
The idea of chemoprevention of prostate cancer has been
pursued aggressively in the past 25 years. The Prostate Cancer
Prevention Trial tested the effect on prostate cancer incidence
of finasteride, an antiandrogen therapy that was approved for
use to reduce prostatic hyperplasia.52 Although antiandrogen
treatment reduced the incidence of low-grade prostate can-
cers, it was associated with increased diagnoses of higher
grade cancers.52 Nutritional supplementation with selenium
and/or vitamin E was tested for prostate cancer prevention,
but neither nutrient was identified as effective for reducing
prostate cancer mortality.53 Whether any other types of nutri-
tional supplements and/or drugs, including aspirin, might
reduce the risk for prostate cancer death continues to be
actively investigated.54 The reasons for the long-standing dis-
parity in prostate cancer mortality between black and white
men (still over a 2-fold difference in 2013) remain largely
unexplained.12 Until we develop a better understanding of
basic prostate cancer etiology, coupled with more effective
approaches to chemoprevention or screening, progress in
prostate cancer mortality will require better methods to distin-
guish aggressive from nonaggressive cancers and continued
progress in treatment.

 Other Cancers
Although mortality rates have been declining substantially
in the United States for the 4 sites that together account
for about one-half of cancer deaths during this 25-year
challenge period (lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate), less
progress has been made for the other half of all cancers (a
13% decline among men and a 17% decline among
women). The declining prevalence of tobacco use has favor-
ably affected death rates for many of the tobacco-caused
cancers apart from lung cancer, and further progress in
tobacco control will have favorable effects on mortality
from many tobacco-caused cancers in the future.55 Unfav-
orable trends in obesity have dampened past gains for the
many obesity-related cancer sites, including not only breast
and colorectal cancers but also endometrial, kidney, liver,
ovary, pancreas, and esophageal cancers, so reducing the
obesity epidemic in the United States will have an impor-
tant impact on future cancer mortality.56
It is important to note that gains have not been made for
all cancers and that, for some cancer sites, mortality trends
have been adverse. Over the past 25 years, mortality from
liver cancer has increased by about 60%, which is a greater
increase than for any other type of cancer. Higher obesity
rates are a contributing factor to this trend, but the biggest
factor is the epidemic of chronic hepatitis C infection
among “baby boomers” (Americans born between 1945 and
1965).57 The USPSTF has recommended everyone born in
that era be screened for hepatitis C, but most of that popu-
lation has not yet been tested.58,59 New antiviral therapies
hold enormous promise to clear chronic hepatitis C infec-
tion and thereby reduce liver cancer risk, but access to the
most effective antiviral therapies is now limited because of
their high cost.60 As competition and/or new drug policies
drive antiviral drug prices lower, more of the 3 million
Americans who now carry chronic hepatitis C infection
should be able to be screened and, if positive, to access
effective antiviral drugs.
Several cancers are known to be caused by infection with
certain types of the human papilloma virus (HPV), includ-
ing virtually all cervical cancers, most anal cancers, and
about one-half of all head and neck cancers.61 Although
vaccination for HPV is effective and recommended, only
about a one-third of girls and one-fifth of boys in the
United States have received a complete series of HPV vac-
cinations.62 Increasing HPV vaccination rates to levels
comparable to those seen for other childhood vaccinations
in the United States will substantially reduce mortality
from HPV-related cancers in adults into the future. Mor-
tality rates from pancreas cancer have not declined from
1990 to 2015. Apart from smoking and obesity, we know
little about modifiable risk factors for pancreatic cancer,
how it might be detected earlier, or how it can be treated.63
For the many other cancers for which modifiable risk fac-
tors are poorly understood and for which there are no effec-
tive prevention strategies or early detection methods, hope
for future improvement needs to come from the develop-
ment of a better understanding of their causes and from
better methods for early cancer detection and treatment.
Differences by Sex and Age
Across the 25-year ACS challenge period, declines in can-
cer mortality were much steeper for men (32%) than for
women (22%), resulting in a reduction of the cancer mor-
tality sex disparity over this time period. Those sex differ-
ences are largely because of differences in lung cancer
trends by sex, coupled with the larger declines in mortality
from prostate cancer among men (53%) compared with the
declines in mortality from breast cancer among women
(39%). Declines over that period were similar by sex for
most other cancers.
Declines in cancer mortality were greatest for Americans
younger than age 65 years (about 37%), lower for those
ages 65 to 74 years (28%), and lowest for those ages 80
years and older (10%). Childhood cancer death rates have
been declining largely because of improvements in the
treatment of pediatric cancers and participation in clinical
trials. Progress has varied considerably by cancer type.
There has been significant success in the treatment of reti-
noblastoma,
Hodgkin
and
non-Hodgkin
lymphoma,
Wilms tumor, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia; but there
has been less success in the treatment of acute myeloid leu-
kemia, Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma,
neuroblastoma, and central nervous system tumors.64 The
far less favorable trend in cancer mortality at older ages is
likely the combined effect of the phenomenon of the com-
pression of mortality into older ages because of treatments
that do not cure cancer but only slow its growth, and the
tendency to forego both cancer screening and more aggres-
sive treatment as age advances. Many of the newer targeted
approaches to cancer therapy are designed to control cancer
growth rather than to totally eradicate malignancy. There-
fore, we should expect that progress in cancer mortality will
continue to be blunted among the elderly in the future.
Clearly, some decisions to forego cancer screening or effec-
tive cancer therapies in the elderly are reasonable choices
due to the presence of comorbid conditions, but the average
life expectancy of a 75-year-old person in the United States
is now about 12 years.65
Differences by Race/Ethnicity and Socioeconomic
Status
There are interacting economic, social, and biological rea-
sons for cancer mortality disparities by race and ethnicity in
the United States. It is encouraging to see that the declines

 in cancer mortality have been steepest among blacks over
the 25-year ACS challenge period. As a result, the 1990
disparity of 32% higher cancer mortality among blacks
compared with whites was cut to 15% by 2013, largely
because of steeper declines in tobacco use and tobacco-
associated cancers among black men.66 Nonetheless, sub-
stantial black-white disparities persist for colorectal, breast,
and prostate cancers.67 Cancer mortality has been histori-
cally much lower for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders,
Hispanic Americans, and American Indians and Alaska
Natives for reasons that have not been fully understood.
Despite their much lower 1990 mortality rate, there were
similar proportional declines in cancer mortality for Asian
Americans/Pacific Islanders (26%) over the 25-year chal-
lenge period, but smaller declines were seen among His-
panic Americans (17%) for reasons that are not clear. The
category Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders is used in this
report to provide consistency for trend data from 1990 to
the present, but this grouping is problematic, as pointed
out by the Office of Management and Budget in 1997,
because it combines many different populations with differ-
ent social and health profiles, including quite different pat-
terns of cancer risk.68,69 No declines were seen among
American Indians and Alaska Natives from 1990 to 2015,
but it is important to note that there was a substantial
increase between 1990 and 1995 followed by an 11%
decline from 1995 to 2010. These trends are uncertain
because of the well documented problems in racial misclas-
sification for both the numerators and the denominators
used for American Indian and Alaska Native mortality
rates.70 Many Native American populations still have high
smoking rates, high rates of obesity and diabetes, and inad-
equate access to high-quality screening and cancer care.
Targeted efforts to address these problems among Ameri-
can Indians and Alaska Natives must be specified in our

Poverty is both a contributor to racial cancer disparities
in the United States and also an important cancer risk fac-
tor in its own right.72 There are many opportunities to
eliminate the economic disparities in cancer in the United
States, including increasing efforts to close the economic
gaps in tobacco use and obesity and enacting national poli-
cies to assure that all Americans have access to effective
health care services. Passage of the Affordable Care Act in
2010 increased access to clinical services for cancer preven-
tion, early detection, and treatment for many Americans
who, because of poverty or preexisting illnesses, were previ-
ously systematically underserved.73-75 This increased access
will likely lead to persistent gains in closing the socioeco-
nomic disparities in cancer mortality in the future, although
many other barriers remain, including the unequal expan-
sion of Medicaid across states, medical services copays,
work leave, and transportation. It is also important that all
Americans have access to effective cancer-prevention serv-
ices. Future progress to better control tobacco and reverse
the obesity epidemic will require policy interventions. Con-
tinued progress on cancer-related policies is now chal-
lenged, however, by the political polarization that has
grown in the United States over the past 25 years on many
societal questions pertaining to health, such as the Afford-
able Care Act and the proper role of government in setting
policies that influence personal choices regarding cancer
risk factors, such as tobacco and unhealthy diet.
Trends in Cancer Treatment
The 25-year ACS challenge period has seen substantial
advances in our understanding of the basic biology of the
more than 200 diseases we call “cancer.” The human
genome was first sequenced in 2001.76 That historic
accomplishment, and the progressively improving technol-
ogies that have allowed us to more completely and afford-
ably interrogate both inherited and tumor genomes, have
produced many expectations for cancer breakthroughs that
have not yet been satisfied. Clinicians already are using
information regarding several inherited mutations that
substantially increase cancer risk, including the BRCA1
and BRCA2 variants, several variants associated with
increased risk for colorectal cancer, and numerous muta-
tions associated with less common familial cancer syn-
dromes. Although the proportion of cases caused by those
variants is small and, thus, have not had substantial effects
on population-level cancer mortality trends, those genetic
discoveries have been very important for many families. To
date, only a small proportion of what seems to be familial
risk has been explained by our interrogation of the human
genome, but many possibilities exist to creatively apply
genetic information to cancer prevention.77 It is increas-
ingly clear that nongenetic factors, such as tobacco, diet,
physical activity, and viral infections, are the major drivers
of the somatic mutations that result in cancer. In the past
25 years, knowledge of the molecular lesions of various
forms of cancers has been used with increasing frequency
and success to identify new therapeutic targets, with impor-
tant progress across many types of cancers. The now classic
example is chronic myelogenous leukemia, which was
largely a fatal disease before the 2001 discovery of an effec-
tive, orally administered, targeted kinase inhibitor.78 Can-
cer therapeutics are now on the threshold of substantial
advancement with our newly discovered abilities to tailor
therapies to target specific characteristics of the tumor
genome and transcriptome and to intervene to enable the
immune system to identify and kill cancer cells.21,79
ACS 2015 Cancer Mortality Goal
COMMENTARY
366
CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians
 Reflections on Goal-Setting
The first challenge goal for a 50% reduction in cancer
mortality for the United States was issued in 1986 by the
leadership of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for the
20-year period from 1980 to 2000.80 Almost immediately,
it was clear the NCI challenge goal would not be reached
(it was determined later that the reduction from 1980 to
2000 was about 4%).81 Therefore, the announcement by
the ACS a decade later of its own challenge goal for a 50%
reduction was met with understandable skepticism. In
2003, the Director of the NCI doubled-down on the ACS
goal by asserting that it would be possible, with adequate
NCI funding, to eliminate deaths and suffering from
cancer by the year 2015.82 Because there was no obvious
pathway to that goal, it was never adopted by any
organization.83 On January 12, 2016, President Obama
announced within his State of the Union address a new
national goal—to cure cancer: “You know, last year, Vice
President Biden said that, with a new moon shot, America
can cure cancer. So tonight, I’m announcing a new
national effort to get it done. And because he’s gone to
the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40
years, I’m putting Joe in charge of mission control. For
the loved ones we’ve all lost, for the family we can still
save, let’s make America the country that cures cancer
once and for all.”84
There are 4 lessons we can now take from our past
experiences with national goal setting for cancer: lessons
on realism, pathways, surveillance, and leadership. First,
goals need to be realistic. The best goals are those that
stretch the limits of what might actually be achieved by
renewed efforts. There is a sweet spot in goal setting
between projecting what will likely happen regardless of
renewed efforts (setting the bar too low) and creating
unrealistic challenges that tend to paralyze us (setting the
bar too high). Second, goals need to be accompanied by a
clear path to success. Whether that path is defined by bet-
ter ways to apply the methods we already have or by inves-
ting in meaningful discoveries that could plausibly soon be
made, it is helpful for everyone to understand what types
of actions might define a path to success. Third, goal set-
ting needs to be followed by monitoring, surveillance, and
clear communication about progress. In the early phase of
the 25-year ACS challenge period, based only on esti-
mates of the future impact on mortality from changes in
cancer risk factors, a group of ACS volunteers and staff
predicted that the 25-year decline might be about 21%;
and later, based on mortality trend data through 2002,
they
predicted
that
the
reduction
might
be
about
23%.85,86 Each of those earlier analyses concluded with
the prediction that the projected declines in cancer mor-
tality could be greater if we would redouble our efforts to
more fully apply methods we already knew. The fourth
lesson on goal setting is that effective leadership is essen-
tial to synergize combined efforts of the many organiza-
tions and systems involved in a nationwide effort. From
the outset, the ACS made it clear that achieving the
national challenge goal of a 50% reduction in cancer mor-
tality would require a broad, multisectoral effort, not only
the effort of any single organization. In retrospect, the
ACS challenge goal was probably owned and operated
more by the ACS itself than by other cancer organizations
across the nation.
As we move forward, it will be important to make any
new goal, including the President’s “moon shot” goal,
become a shared vision that is framed in realism, accompa-
nied by a feasible path to success, publically monitored, and
managed by effective leadership. Lessons over the past 25
years also should have taught us that the word “cure”
should not mean only medical therapeutics. Curing the
cancer problem will certainly require that we discover more
effective treatments, but the success of the past 25 years has
shown that prevention is also a powerful cure. As we make
timely new investments in discovering new cancer treat-
ments, we also need to develop a new national consensus
about how social policy can support individual decision
making to prevent cancer.
Conclusion
We have now experienced 25 years of historic progress in
our commitment to reduce the cancer burden in the United
States by 50%. During the 1990 to 2015 ACS challenge
period, cancer death rates declined by about 26%. Although
we can celebrate the thousands of lives that reduction rep-
resents, we should also be humbled by the fact that more
lives could have been saved. That the ACS challenge goal
to reduce US cancer mortality by 50% over the 25-year
period from 1990 to 2015 was only one-half achieved
should be seen as a glass half full. This progress should
eliminate any historical remnants of cancer fatalism, and it
should now stimulate our national imagination about what
might be possible to achieve into the future. All sectors of
civil society will need to join in efforts to further reduce
cancer mortality in the United States, including those
focused on the many social determinants of cancer, includ-
ing income, availability of care, and many other social and
environmental factors impacting cancer-reducing policies
and programs. How much more progress we will make will
depend on the extent to which policy makers and the
American public can join together to create systems and
incentives to understand cancer better, to reduce several of
the known risk factors for cancer, to better diagnose cancer
earlier, and to assure that state-of-the-art treatment is
available for all. �
