Abstract
Previous studies have suggested that a high intake of sugar-sweetened beverages is positively associated with the risk of a coronary event.
However, a few studies have examined the association between sucrose (the most common extrinsic sugar in Sweden) and incident coronary
events. The objective of the present study was to examine the associations between sucrose intake and coronary event risk and to determine
whether these associations are specific to certain subgroups of the population (i.e. according to physical activity, obesity status, educational
level, alcohol consumption, smoking habits, intake of fat and intake of fruits and vegetables). We performed a prospective analysis on 26 190
individuals (62 % women) free from diabetes and without a history of CVD from the Swedish population-based Malmö Diet and Cancer cohort.
Over an average of 17 years of follow-up (457 131 person-years), 2493 incident cases of coronary events were identified. Sucrose intake was
obtained from an interview-based diet history method, including 7-d records of prepared meals and cold beverages and a 168-item diet
questionnaire covering other foods. Participants who consumed >15 % of their energy intake (E%) from sucrose showed a 37 (95 % CI 13,
66) % increased risk of a coronary event compared with the lowest sucrose consumers (<5 E%) after adjusting for potential confounders. The
association was not modified by the selected lifestyle factors. The results indicated that sucrose consumption higher than 15 E% (5 % of this
population) is associated with an increased risk of a coronary event.
Key words: Sucrose: CVD: Effect modification: Risk factors
CVD, including coronary events (CHD, i.e. myocardial infarc-
tion (MI)) and cerebrovascular disease (stroke), is the leading
cause of death worldwide(1). An unhealthy diet is one of the
modifiable risk factors for CVD. The increased consumption of
sugar-rich foods, particularly sugar-sweetened beverages, has
been observed worldwide(2). Sugars can be naturally occurring
(intrinsic) in many foods such as vegetables, fruits and milk
products or can be added to foods (extrinsic)(3).
Excessive sugar consumption may reduce the intake of
essential nutrients. Yet, the effect of added sugar on micro-
nutrient dilution remains unknown(4–6). High sugar intake may
also increase energy intake, leading to unhealthy weight gain(7),
and thereby increasing the risk of non-communicable diseases
such as type 2 diabetes and CVD(8). Sugar may also directly
contribute to CVD by influencing fat metabolism or inflamma-
tion. Recommendations on the maximum amount of energy
from sugars vary in different regions and from different
institutes – for example, the World Health Organization(9)
guidelines strongly recommend <10 % of energy from free
sugars, whereas the US Institute of Medicine recommends
<25 %(10) of energy from added sugar. The Nordic Nutrition
Recommendations state that <10 % of energy should come from
added sugar(11). A study among US adults indicated that the
participants who consumed added sugar above the recom-
mended WHO level (10 %) and below the US Institute of
Medicine recommendation (25 %) had a 30 % increased risk of
cardiovascular mortality compared with individuals consuming
<10 %(8).
Evidence of the long-term adverse effects of high sugar
consumption on metabolic outcomes is inconsistent, and a few
studies have examined the relationship between sugar con-
sumption and CVD risk. According to systematic literature
reviews,
consuming
sugar-sweetened
beverages
likely
increases the risk of type 2 diabetes(12–14), although the

 evidence for an association between the consumption of spe-
cific sugars (e.g. fructose or sucrose) and type 2 diabetes risk is
not as conclusive(12). The associations between the consump-
tion of sugars or sugar-rich foods and CVD risk are not widely
studied, and the evidence is inconclusive(12,15). In addition, a
few studies have investigated whether the association between
consumption of sugars and risk of CVD is more pronounced in
subgroups of the population(16).
The most common sugar added to the diet (extrinsic sugar) in
Sweden is sucrose, a disaccharide consisting of glucose and
fructose(3). Sucrose can therefore also be utilised as a marker of
added sugar in the Swedish diet. In the Malmö Diet and Cancer
(MDC) cohort, men consuming <10 % of their energy from
sucrose had a 14 % lower risk of CVD (coronary events and
ischaemic stroke) compared with individuals with higher intake
levels. A similar trend (but not statistically significant) was
observed for women(17). In a more recent study within the MDC
cohort, we did not observe a significantly increased risk of
coronary events when comparing the highest and lowest
quintiles of sucrose, although we observed a tendency among
men (hazard ratio (HR) = 1·16; 95 % CI 0·97, 1·39)(18). Therefore,
the aim of the present study was to further examine the
associations between sucrose intake and coronary event risk by
evaluating the risk at more extreme, but still relevant, intake
levels.
For
example,
evaluating
the
association
among
individuals who consumed <5 percentage of energy (E%) and
>15 E%, and test whether the association is linear. We also used
a longer follow-up period and examined whether these
associations are specific to certain subgroups of the population
according to lifestyle factors (i.e. physical activity, obesity status,
educational level, alcohol consumption, smoking habits, fat
intake, and fruit and vegetable intake). In particular, we
examined whether moderate sucrose consumption (even below
10 E% level) is associated with an increased risk of coronary
events in certain groups of individuals.
Methods
Population and setting
The present study was conducted in Sweden within the MDC
cohort. The MDC study population (men and women aged
between 44 and 73 years who lived in Malmö) was recruited
between 1991 and 1996. The participants were recruited
through either a passive method, in which research invitations
were placed in public areas such as banks and post offices, or
an active recruitment method, in which participants were
invited through a personal letter sent to the population. If the
participants did not respond to the first letter, second and third
letters were also sent. Individuals who did not respond to the
final letter received a follow-up phone call(19). Participants who
had limited Swedish language skills or were mentally impaired
were excluded from the study.
A baseline questionnaire was used to collect data on demo-
graphics, physical activity, educational level, smoking habits
and alcohol consumption. Among the 74 138 participants
recruited into the MDC, 68 905 were eligible, and 28 098
subjects completed the baseline examination(19). Mortality was
lower among participants compared with non-participants
during recruitment and for at least a few years after recruit-
ment. However, the socio-economic structure and prevalence
of smoking and obesity among MDC participants were com-
parable with the participants who took part in a mailed health
survey during the same period(20). In the present study, we
excluded individuals with a history of CVD (coronary events or
stroke
from
national
registers)
(n
820)
and
diabetes
(self-reported diagnosis or use of diabetes medication) (n 870)
at baseline, and those with missing data on smoking (n 12), BMI
(n 42), leisure-time physical activity (n 191) and educational
level (n 71), resulting in 26 190 individuals available for
analyses (online Supplementary Fig. S1). These participants
were followed-up until the end point – that is, the occurrence of
death, first cardiovascular event, emigration from Sweden or the
end of follow-up (31 December 2013).
Dietary data
Dietary habits were measured using a modified diet history
method combining a 7-d food diary, a semi-quantitative, 168-
item questionnaire and a diet history interview. The 7-d food
diary was used to collect information on prepared meals and
cold beverages, whereas the questionnaire collected informa-
tion on frequencies (usually numbers per day, week or month)
and portion sizes (from pictures) of foods not collected in the
food diary(21). During the food history interview, participants
described their usual food preparation methods and portion
sizes (using photographs) for the meals registered in the food
diary. The Swedish Food Database was used to convert the
food data collected from the modified diet history into total
energy and nutrient intakes(22). Sucrose was measured, or cal-
culated, for all foods included in the database. The validity of
the modified diet history method was examined against a
reference method, including 18 d of weighed food records(22).
The validation correlation coefficient (Pearson’s) of energy-
adjusted sucrose intake was relatively high in both males and
females (0·60 and 0·74, respectively)(23).
In September 1994, there was a change in the coding of
dietary data to reduce the interview time; however, this change
did not influence the ranking of individuals according to dietary
intake(21). The main exposure in the present study was sucrose
intake, which was expressed as a percentage of non-alcohol
energy (E%), and the participants were categorised into five
groups: <5, 5–7·5, 7·5–10, 10–15 and >15 E%. The participants
were also categorised into four groups according to their
energy-adjusted intakes (using the residual model) of foods that
contributed sucrose to the diet – that is, sweets, chocolates,
sugar, jam/marmalade, fruit juice, sugar-sweetened beverages,
and cakes and pastries.
Assessment of other variables
Weight and height were determined with shoes off, and the
values were used to calculate BMI. Waist circumference
was obtained after measuring the midpoint between the lowest
rib margin and the iliac crest. Blood pressure was obtained
while the participants rested, lying in a supine position.

 Data concerning smoking status (smokers, ex-smokers and
non-smokers), leisure-time physical activity (sex-specific quin-
tiles 1–5) and educational level (elementary or less, primary and
secondary, upper secondary, further education without a
degree and an university degree) were collected from the
questionnaire. The level of leisure-time physical activity was
determined using a questionnaire, in which the participants
were asked to estimate the duration per week spent on
seventeen different activities. The questions were adapted from
the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire(24).
The duration was multiplied by an intensity factor to create a
leisure-time physical activity score. The participants were
divided into sex-specific quintiles. Alcohol consumption was
obtained from both the 7-d food diary and the questionnaire.
Individuals who did not consume any alcohol within the 7 d or
during the previous year in the questionnaire were categorised
as
zero
consumers,
and
the
remaining
subjects
were
categorised into sex-specific quintiles according to intakes
during the 7 d. Individuals who reported a substantial dietary
change in the past were classified as ‘dietary changers’(25).
Potential energy misreporters were identified by comparing
reported energy intake with estimated total energy expenditure
(estimated from calculated BMR and self-reported physical
activity level)(26).
Determination of the end point
Information on incident cases of coronary events occurring
within the cohort until the end of follow-up (31 December
2013) was obtained from national registries – that is, the
Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and the Cause of Death
Register. A coronary event was defined as a fatal or non-fatal
MI (International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 codes:
410A-410X; ICD-10: I21) or death attributable to ischaemic heart
disease (ICD-9 codes: 410–414; ICD-10: I20-I25).
Statistical analysis
Differences in the baseline characteristics between the coronary
event cases and the non-cases and across intake groups of
sucrose were examined using an ANOVA for continuous
variables and a χ2 analysis for categorical variables. The skewed
food variables were logarithmically transformed to normalise
the distribution. A Cox’s proportional hazards regression was
used to model the association between sucrose, sucrose-
containing food sources and coronary event risk. The propor-
tional hazards assumption was assessed using Schoenfeld
statistics. To fulfil the proportional hazards assumption, the
model was stratified for sex and smoking. The HR and 95 % CI
were calculated using the lowest categories as the reference
group, and the follow-up time was used as the time scale. Trend
was calculated using the median values assigned to each
sucrose category and modelled as a continuous variable. In the
basic model, we adjusted for total energy intake (continuous),
sex, screening age (continuous), dietary data collection method
(before or after 1 September 1994) and data collection season
(spring/summer/fall/winter). For the final model, a multi-
variable analysis was conducted to adjust for other potential
confounders (i.e. smoking (categorical), alcohol consumption
(categorical), leisure-time physical activity (categorical) and
educational level (categorical)) selected from the literature for
CVD risk factors. We additionally adjusted for dietary factors
associated with CVD, including wholegrains, fruits and vege-
tables, coffee, fermented milk, fish and meat(18,27,28). We also
included waist circumference (continuous) in a separate model
because this parameter could be a confounder or be within the
causal pathway for incident coronary events. In the sensitivity
analyses, we excluded potential energy misreporters (for defi-
nition, see above) and individuals who reported a substantial
dietary change in the past. This excluded group accounted for
35 % of the study sample.
A restricted cubic spline was computed to examine the shape
of the association between sucrose intake and coronary event
risk, controlling for the confounders similar to those in the
complete multivariable analysis; four knots were fitted on
the basis of Harrell’s recommended percentiles(29), using the
median intake 8·2 E% as the reference point. On the basis of the
non-linear shape of the association, we also used the group
with medium sucrose intake (7·5–10 E%) as the reference group
in the analyses with categorical sucrose intakes.
To examine whether the associations were specific to certain
subgroups of the population, we performed stratified analyses
to assess the potential effect modifications using predefined
covariates. These effect modifiers were selected as relevant
lifestyle risk factors for coronary events and included leisure-
time physical activity, BMI categories, educational level, alcohol
habits, smoking habits, intake of fat (E%; tertiles), and intakes of
fruits and vegetables (g/MJ; tertiles). Interaction tests between
sucrose intake and these lifestyle factors on coronary event risk
were conducted by introducing a multiplicative factor in the
model with the continuous variables of sucrose and lifestyle
factors. All the analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics
(version 22; IBM Corporation) and Stata/SE (version 12.1;
StatCorp LP). All the tests were two-sided, and P-values <0·05
were considered statistically significant.
Results
Baseline characteristics
The mean age of the study population at baseline was 58 (SD
7·6) years (range 44·3–73·6), with 9947 (38 %) males and 16 243
(62 %) females. During an average of 17 years of follow-up
(range 0–22·8 years and 457 131 person-years), we ascertained
2493 incident cases of coronary events (1504 men and 989
women). The baseline characteristics are summarised in Table 1
according to the amount of sucrose intake. Compared with
individuals with lower sucrose consumption, individuals with
higher sucrose consumption were more often smokers, had
lower educational levels and were less likely to be alcohol
consumers. Among men, higher sucrose intake was associated
with lower waist circumference; this association was not
affected after excluding diet changers and energy misreporters.
Sucrose intake was inversely associated with wholegrains, meat
and fish intakes. However, the highest median intake of fruits
and vegetables and fermented milk and the lowest frequency of
Sucrose consumption and coronary events

 individuals
with

activity
were
observed among individuals with moderate sucrose intake.
Higher sucrose intake was significantly and positively asso-
ciated with the consumption of all sucrose-containing food
sources – that is, sweets, chocolates, sugar and jam, fruit juice,
sugar-sweetened beverages, and cakes and pastries (Table 1).
Sucrose and the risk of incident coronary events
The incidence rates of coronary events within the lowest and
highest intakes of sucrose E% were 6·1 v. 7·5 cases/1000 per-
son-years, respectively. In the minimally adjusted model, an
intake >15 E% compared with <5 E% was associated with a
48 % increased coronary event risk (Ptrend < 0·001). In addition,
a tendency towards a decreased risk of coronary events in the
groups consuming 5–7·5 E% and 7·5–10 E% compared with the
lowest category was observed (Table 2). After adjusting for
potential confounders (including waist circumference), the
association was attenuated; however, the risk in the highest
group (>15 E%) compared with the lowest intake group
remained significant (HR 1·37; 95 % CI 1·13, 1·66). Among the
potential confounders, smoking, waist circumference, alcohol
consumption, leisure-time physical activity and educational
level affected the HR. The risks of coronary events across the
other groups (<15 E%) were similar; thus, an elevated risk was
observed in the group with intakes >15 E% (Table 2). The
associations were attenuated between the extreme intake
groups when the energy misreporters and participants with a
reported diet change in the past (35 % of the study sample)
were excluded from the analysis (HR 1·25; 95 % CI 0·98, 1·61).
However, when using the middle group (7·5–10 E%) as the
reference, the risk estimate for the highest intake group was
similar after excluding diet changers and energy misreporters
(HR 1·30; 95 % CI 1·04, 1·63) (Table 2).

with statistically significant levels above 13 E%.

 associations were suggested for individuals with a high edu-
cational level (HR for highest v. lowest intake = 2·19; 95 % CI
1·10, 4·40). Among individuals with high levels of physical
activity, a significantly increased risk was observed at a mod-
erate sucrose intake (5–7·5 E%), with a 38 % (HR 1·38; 95 % CI
1·00, 1·91) increased risk compared with individuals with <5 E
%. However, a moderate amount of sucrose (5–10 E%) was not
associated with increased coronary event risk compared with
low sucrose intake (<5 E%) in any other strata. Overall, the
results indicated that the association between sucrose intake
and coronary event risk is independent of lifestyle factors, and
none of the potential effect modifiers strengthened or wea-
kened the association between sucrose and coronary events.
Discussion
In this prospective study, high sucrose intake was associated
with an increased risk of incident coronary events. In all, 5 % of
the population with an intake >15 E% had a 37 % increased risk
compared with individuals with an intake <5 E%. However, the
non-linear association indicated no benefit of having a lower
sucrose intake than the median intake (8·2 E%). None of the
sucrose-containing food sources or beverages were significantly
associated with coronary event risk; therefore, no single food
source could explain the increased risk observed for sucrose.
A few studies have investigated the association between the
consumption of sugars (including sucrose), sugar-sweetened
beverages and sugar-rich foods and CVD risk. A systematic
literature review and meta-analysis of four prospective studies
revealed a 17 % increased risk of CHD for every serving per day
of sugar-sweetened beverages(30,31). None of the included stu-
dies were, however, conducted among European populations.
Studies examining specific sugars are even rarer. Liu et al.(32)
did not observe an association between sucrose and CVD risk
among 75 521 women from the Nurses’ Health Study. In
Sweden, sugar-sweetened beverages are sweetened by sucrose.
We observed a stronger association for sucrose intake than
sugar-sweetened beverage intake, which might indicate that the
combined sucrose intake might be more important than only
sugar-sweetened beverages. However, sugar-sweetened beve-
rage intake was reported in the 7-d food diary, and mis-
classifications might occur, especially among individuals with
low intake.
Added sugar in the form of sucrose is the main source of
fructose in the Swedish diet(33). The evidence for the adverse
effects of fructose is mainly based on animal studies. It is
unclear whether the same effects, and to a similar extent, occur
in humans, especially in the long-term(34–36). The conclusion
from short-term clinical trials so far has been that fructose has
no additional adverse health effects on blood pressure or body
weight when exchanged isoenergetically for other carbohy-
drates. However, significant effects of fructose have been
observed in hyperenergetic trials(37,38). In addition, very high
fructose intakes (>100 g/d) seem to increase LDL-cholesterol
when isoenergetically replaced with other carbohydrates(39).
A systematic review concluded that dietary sugar raised blood
lipids – a relationship that seems to be independent of the effect
of sugars on body weight(40). Within the MDC cohort, high
sucrose intake was associated with higher TAG and lower HDL-
cholesterol concentrations(18). In animal studies, high sucrose
intake was associated with the development of hypertension,
which is a risk factor for CVD(41). An epidemiological study also
suggested that a high intake of sugar and sugar-sweetened
beverages
was
associated
with
an
increase
in
blood
pressure(31,42). In contrast, Forman et al.(43) observed no link
between fructose and development of hypertension. Another
possible mechanism is the influence of sugar on inflammation.
A randomised-controlled trial conducted on healthy young
men(44) and a prospective study conducted on men(16) reported
a higher degree of inflammation after the consumption of sugar-
sweetened beverages. The sugar-sweetened beverages induced
hyperglycaemia
and
in
turn
influenced
inflammation,
as
demonstrated in a randomised trial conducted on healthy
women(45). Inflammation is a major factor in the pathogenesis
of CHD and can be used as a marker for the increased risk of
coronary events(46). However, a study conducted within the
MDC cohort showed no difference in the level of inflammatory
markers between those with >
and
<10 E% of sucrose
intake(47). This absence of association may reflect the small
sample size of the study; furthermore, the age range of the study
participants (63–68 years) differed from the age range (44–73
years) in the present study.
The present study has several strengths. First, as a pro-
spective cohort study, the likelihood of reverse causality was
minimised because information on the exposure and risk fac-
tors was collected at baseline before the development of a
coronary event. Second, the large sample size of the cohort and
the number of incident coronary event cases provided a large
statistical power to detect the associated effects of the sugar
exposure. Third, cases of incident coronary events were
obtained from national hospital registers. The coronary event
statuses have been validated to have a high sensitivity and a
high predictive value, thereby reducing the misclassification of
the disease status(48,49). Fourth, the MDC data set contained
information on potential confounders (age, season, diet method,
energy intake, smoking, alcohol consumption, leisure-time

 physical activity, education, waist circumference and other
dietary factors) that we adjusted for. The data set also contained
variables that facilitated the sensitivity analyses, for example,
whether the participants had changed their food habits in the
past and energy misreporting. However, the results did not
change markedly when these individuals were excluded,
especially not when using the middle group as a reference
group. Moreover, the use of a validated modified diet history
method(22) provided a detailed exposure assessment of sucrose-
containing foods and beverages. In addition, the food database
created for the MDC cohort was comprehensive, and any
missing foods were updated into the database. For all the foods
included in the database, sucrose was measured directly,
calculated from recipes or obtained from the table of contents.
There are also certain limitations to the present study. Dietary
intake was self-reported; therefore, we cannot rule out mea-
surement errors. There was a tendency for women and obese
individuals to under-report the consumption of added sugars
and snacks consumed between meals(50). Measurement errors
due to self-reporting could lead to the misclassification of
sucrose intake. However, this error is likely random (non-
differential) and is not associated with the outcome status,
because the coronary events were recorded after baseline data
were collected, and individuals with prevalent coronary events
were excluded. This non-differential error could have atte-
nuated the association observed in the present study; therefore,
the associated effect of high sucrose intake may be even higher
than that observed in the present study. In addition, because
sucrose has been used as a marker of added sugar, the con-
sumption of added sugar was underestimated and probably the
association between added sugar intake and coronary event
risk as well. To obtain more reliable estimates on sucrose
intake, biomarkers, for example, the urinary excretion of
sucrose, could be used as a surrogate measure of sucrose
intake(51). Dietary intake was only assessed during the baseline
examinations and may have changed during the follow-up
period. For example, the dietary habits in Sweden during which
the baseline data were collected (1991–1996) are different from
the current dietary habits – for instance, there has been an
increase in the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages
from 50 litres/person per year in 1990 to 87 litres/person per
year in 2013(52). Although we had detailed information and
controlled for the most important confounders, we cannot rule
out the possibility of residual confounding factors. Furthermore,
the results were based on a cohort of participants who were
between the ages of 44 and 73 years, potentially limiting the
generalisability of the results to younger and older populations.
Additional studies are required in other age groups to confirm
the current findings.
The median intake of sucrose reported in the present study
was 8·2 E%. This finding is similar to a national survey con-
ducted in Sweden in 1997 (median intake of sucrose was 8 E%
for both men and women)(53). On the basis of results from a
national survey in 2010, the intake of sucrose had decreased to
7·3 E%. In the present study, we could not differentiate whether
sucrose
was
obtained
from
naturally
occurring
sources
(intrinsic) or from added sugar (extrinsic). However, in the
national survey from 2010, only 20 % of the sucrose consumed
was obtained from natural sources – that is, fruits, vegetables
and juices. The mean intake of added sugar (sucrose, fructose,
glucose, starch hydrolysates and other isolated sugar prepara-
tions added during food preparation) was estimated to be
8·9 E%(33). In the present study, only forty-one individuals
(0·16 % of the total study population) had a sucrose intake >25
E% (maximum sucrose intake of 38 E%). Therefore, we could
not examine the coronary event risk for individuals with a
sucrose intake level >25 E%.
In conclusion, these data show a non-linear association
between sucrose intake and coronary event incidence after
controlling for potential confounders. These results further
indicate that a sucrose intake above 15 E% increases coronary
event risk. In addition, these data do not suggest that a sucrose
intake between 5 and 10 E% increases the coronary event risk.
There was no strong evidence of heterogeneity of effect for any
of the lifestyle factors. However, further long-term studies are
required to determine whether other factors, for example,
genetic factors, influence the susceptibility to coronary events,
even with moderate sugar consumption. Further investigation is
also warranted to determine the effects of sucrose from different
sources on the incidence of coronary events.
