Introduction Cam morphology is a strong risk factor 
for the development of hip pain and osteoarthritis. 
It is increasingly thought to develop in association 
with intense physical activity during youth; however, 
the aetiology remains uncertain. The study aim was 
to characterise the effect of physical activity on 
morphological hip development during adolescence.
Methods Cross-sectional study of individuals aged 
9–18 years recruited from Southampton Football Club 
Academy (103 male) with an age-matched control 
population (52 males and 55 females). Assessments 
included questionnaires and 3 Tesla MRI of both hips. 
Alpha angle, epiphyseal extension and epiphyseal tilt 
were measured on radial images.
results Alpha angle and epiphyseal extension 
increased most rapidly between ages 12 and 14 years. 
Soft-tissue hypertrophy at the femoral head-neck 
junction preceded osseous cam morphology and was 
first evident at age 10 years. The greatest increase and 
highest absolute values of alpha angle and epiphyseal 
extension were colocalised at 1 o’clock. Maximum alpha 
angles were 6.7 degrees greater in males than females 
(p=0.005). Compared with individuals who play no 
regular sport, alpha angles were 4.0 degrees higher in 
individuals who play sport for a school or club (p=0.041) 
and 7.7 degrees higher in individuals competing at a 
national or international level (p=0.035). There was no 
association with leg dominance .
Conclusions Sporting activity during adolescence 
is strongly associated with the development of cam 
morphology secondary to epiphyseal hypertrophy and 
extension with a dose-response relationship. Males 
participating in competitive sport are at particularly 
elevated risk of developing cam morphology and 
secondary hip pathology.
InTrOduCTIOn
Cam morphology of the hip is a strong risk factor 
for the development of hip pain and osteoar-
thritis.1 At present, the pathogenesis of cam 
morphology remains poorly understood.2 The 
development of interventions to prevent cam 
formation and hence secondary injury and osteo-
arthritis requires an improved understanding of 
its causation.
Studies to date conclude that cam morphology 
develops around the time of physeal closure3–7; 
however, it is not clear when morphological 
changes are first evident. This is critical to the 
timing of possible preventative interventions. 
The prevalence of cam morphology is higher in 
adult athlete cohorts compared with non-athletic 
cohorts,8 which may explain the increased rates 
of hip osteoarthritis in retired footballers.9–11 
Small studies suggest a higher prevalence of cam 
morphology among athletes for a number of sports 
including soccer,12 basketball4 and ice hockey.13 
One proposed mechanism of cam formation is 
epiphyseal extension at the anterosuperior head-
neck junction.14 However, studies demonstrate 
limited correlation between epiphyseal extension 
and subsequent cam morphology.7 15 These studies 
address bony morphology and not the cartilagi-
nous structures of skeletally immature hips. The 
lower prevalence of cam morphology among 
females compared with males suggests a possible 
gender-specific pathogenesis.16
Aims of this study were to i) explore when cam 
morphology first develops, ii) characterise the 
mechanism of cam development and iii) identify 
associations with cam morphology.
MeThOds
study design
Cross-sectional cohort study (participants will 
subsequently be followed-up longitudinally).
Population
Individuals aged 9–18 years were recruited from 
Southampton Football Club (SFC) Academy and 
local schools (controls) (see online supplementary 
figure S1for recruitment flowchart and supple-
mentary data for power calculations). Cohorts 
were loaded for younger age groups to ensure 
an adequate number of individuals with an open 
physis and to compensate for loss to follow-up 
during the planned longitudinal study .
At SFC, randomly selected individuals from 
each age category were invited to participate (two 
individuals declined). The control population was 
recruited through public engagement events at 
local schools. Specific age groups were targeted 
to recruit approximately age-matched cohorts, 
but no individual was declined participation. The 
only exclusion criterion was previous hip surgery.
Assessment
Participant demographics and activity levels
Questionnaires were completed with the assis-
tance of parents where appropriate and included 
the collection of patient demographics (age, 
gender, body mass index (BMI), leg dominance)

and activity levels. Activity was evaluated using three methods: 
i) SFC Academy versus general population controls; ii) three-tier 
classification denoted ‘Activity Level’: a) ‘no sport’: no regular 
sport besides physical education classes at school, b) ‘sport’: 
regularly play sport for school or club team, c) ‘athlete’: compete 
at national or international level; iii) Physical Activity Question-
naire (PAQ) for older children (aged 9–13 years) and adoles-
cents (aged 14–18 years).17 This collects information on sport 
and exercise undertaken during an average week and provides 
a summary score of physical activity levels (a score of 1 indi-
cates low physical activity, whereas a score of 5 indicates high 
physical activity). It differentiates between active and inactive 
individuals but does not measure duration, frequency or inten-
sity of activity.18
Imaging
Cam morphology was assessed with MRI of both hips using a 
3 Tesla Philips Achieva platform and torso coil (Philips Health-
care). T
wo morphological sequences were acquired: three-di-
mensional (3D) water selective fluid (WATSf) to image joint 
cartilage and bone, and 3D proton density fat saturation (PDFS) 
to image the physeal scar (see online supplementary data for 
sequence parameters).
3D multiplanar reconstructions were performed using OsiriX 
Software (V
.6.0.2, Pixmeo). Radial images were acquired 
around the axis of the femoral neck at 30 degree intervals 
(see online supplementary figure S2).
Imaging outcome measures
Cam morphology was quantified using the alpha angle for bone 
and cartilage, which was treated as a continuous variable given 
there is no agreed diagnostic threshold (figure 1).19 Radio-
graphic epidemiological studies suggest alpha angles above 60 
degrees are elevated and potentially diagnostic.20 Cartilage alpha 
angle was chosen as the primary outcome measure because in 
the skeletally immature hip the secondary ossification centre 
does not accurately reflect overall hip shape. Furthermore, 
it is non-ossified structures that impact in femoroacetabular 
impingement. The physis of each hip was scored as ‘open’ or 
‘closed’ (see online supplementary figure S3).
Epiphyseal morphology was quantified using epiphyseal 
extension, which measures the distance the epiphysis extends 
along the femoral neck expressed as a ratio of femoral head 
diameter. Physeal tilt was quantified as the ratio of epiphyseal 
extension on either side of the physis (figure 1).13
Alpha angle and epiphyseal extension were measured using 
custom-developed software on the radial slices at 11 o'clock, 
12 o'clock, 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock and 3 o'clock (figure 1) (see 
online supplementary data for reproducibility results). These 
positions were selected as they include the most frequent loca-
tions of cam morphology and pilot data suggested the magni-
tude of cam morphology was greatest at 1 o'clock.21 To account 
for variation in the location of cam morphology, the primary 
outcome measure was maximum cartilage alpha angle from 
11 o'clock through to 3 o'clock.
Measurements were performed by an academic orthopaedic 
clinician (AP) blinded to participant information. Reproduc-
ibility readings were performed by a further academic ortho-
paedic clinician (SF).
statistical analysis
Statistical calculations were performed using STATA V
.14.1 
(College Station, Texas, USA). Distribution of values was exam-
ined using histograms and kernel density plots. Comparison 
of means was undertaken using an independent two-tailed 
Student’s t-test for parametric data and Wilcoxon rank sum 
test for non-parametric data. Linear regression modelling was 
adopted to assess variables that predict alpha angle and epiphy-
seal extension. Stepwise estimation identified variables for inclu-
sion in multivariate analysis as age, gender and activity level. 
Residual plots of the regression models demonstrated normal 
distributions but evidence of heteroscedasticity. Therefore, the 
Huber-White-Sandwich estimator was adopted with clustering 
for laterality to account for the inclusion of left and right hips 
that are not independent measurements. Interactions were eval-
uated with linear regression of each combination of variables 
Figure 1 Soft tissue hypertrophy at the head-neck junction preceded epiphyseal extension and osseous cam morphology (A). Alpha angle was 
calculated by drawing a line from the centre of a best-fit circle surrounding the femoral head to the midpoint of a line transecting the narrowest 
portion of the femoral neck. A further line was then drawn from the centre of the best-fit circle to where the contour of the femoral head first exits 
this circle. The alpha angle is the angle between these two lines and was measured for cartilage (b) and bone (C). Epiphyseal extension (d) was 
quantified by measuring the distance from the medial femoral head to the most distal extent of the epiphysis along a line parallel to the axis of the 
femoral neck as was created when measuring the alpha angle. This distance was then divided by the diameter of the femoral head to produce a 
standardised ratio. Epiphyseal tilt was assessed as the ratio between epiphyseal extension on opposing sides of the femoral head (X/Y).

that predict maximum alpha angle and epiphyseal extension. 
None reached statistical significance, hence no interaction terms 
were included in the multivariate models. Statistical significance 
was set at p<0.05. MRI outcomes were incomplete due to claus-
trophobia or movement artefact in five hips (two participants in 
SFC cohort and one female control) and the remaining dataset 
was complete. No imputation was performed.
resulTs
Participant demographics
The study cohort consisted of 103 males from SFC (mean age 
152 months), 52 control males (mean age 153 months) and 55 
control females (mean age 167 months) (see online supplemen-
tary table S1). Mean BMI was 18.5 (SD 2.6) in the SFC cohort, 
19.5 (SD 3.2) in control males and 20.4 (SD 3.7) in control 
females.
In the SFC cohort, the dominant leg was right in 77 individ-
uals, left in 20 individuals, with 6 ambipedal. In male controls, 
the dominant leg was right in 36 individuals, left in 9 individuals, 
with 7 ambipedal. In female controls, the right leg was dominant 
in 41 individuals, left in 6 individuals, with 8 ambipedal. The 
primary sport of male and female active controls was football or 
rugby in 31 individuals and non-kicking sports in 40 individuals.
Activity scores
There were three classification systems for measuring activity: i) 
Participants were classed as SFC cohort (n=103), control males 
(n=52) or control females (n=55). ii) Participants were classed 
as ‘no sport’, ‘sport’ or ‘athlete’. All SFC participants were 
classed ‘athlete’. Control males consisted of 13 ‘no sport’ and 
39 ‘sport’. Control females consisted of 22 ‘no sport’, 31 ‘sport’ 
and 2 ‘athlete’. iii) Participants completed the PAQ. Mean PAQ 
for males classified as ‘athlete’ was 3.08 (SD 0.73), ‘sport’ was 
2.92 (SD 0.70) and ‘no sport’ was 2.66 (SD 0.67). Mean PAQ 
for females classed as ‘athlete’ was 3.11 (SD 0.59), ‘sport’ was 
2.62 (SD 0.63) and ‘no sport’ was 2.07 (SD 0.63). Mean PAQ 
decreased with age in all groups.
Quantitative MrI morphology
Alpha angle
Cartilage alpha angle was greatest at the 1 o'clock posi-
tion before and after physeal closure, and while values increased 
at all positions with age, the greatest increase was also at 
1 o'clock (table 1). The most rapid increase in alpha angle was 
between age 12 and 14 years, with only a small increase beyond 
14 years (table 2). Contrary to cartilage alpha angles, bone alpha 
angles were never elevated at the 1 o'clock position before age 
12 years (see figure 2 and online supplementary figure S7).
Activity levels and maximum cartilage alpha angle
Maximum cartilage alpha angle increased with age and activity 
level (table 2 and figure 3).
Adjusting for age, female controls had a maximum cartilage 
alpha angle 7.4 degrees lower than male controls (p=0.004). 
Male controls had a maximum cartilage alpha angle 4.33 degrees 
lower than the SFC cohort (p=0.042).
Adjusting for age and gender, individuals who played sport 
for a school or club team had a maximum cartilage alpha angle 
4.0 degrees greater than individuals who play no regular sport 
(p=0.041). Compared with individuals who play no regular 
sport, alpha angles were 7.6 degrees higher in individuals 
competing at a national or international level (p=0.035).

Adjusting for age and gender, maximum cartilage alpha angle 
increased with PAQ, but the relationship was not statistically 
significant. There was no statistically significant association 
between cartilage alpha angle and BMI or leg dominance when 
adjusting for age, gender, and activity levels.
Physeal closure
In the SFC cohort, the physis was open in 135 hips and closed 
in 68 hips. Among male controls, the physis was open in 80 hips 
and closed in 24 hips. Among female controls, the physis was 
open in 32 hips and closed in 76 hips. The physis closed between 
ages 13 and 16 years in males and between 11 and 12 years in 
females. No difference was detected in the age of physeal closure 
between the SFC cohort and male controls.
Epiphyseal extension
Epiphyseal extension increased at each clockface position with 
age but was greatest at 11 o’clock prior to physeal closure and 
1 o’clock after physeal closure (table 1). This limits the value of 
using maximal epiphyseal extension to investigate the pathogen-
esis of cam development, hence this study focused on factors 
associated with extension at 1 o’clock.
Activity levels and epiphyseal extension at 1 o’clock
Epiphyseal extension at 1 o’clock increased with age and activity 
level, as with cartilage alpha angle (table 2).
Adjusting for age, female controls had an epiphyseal extension 
measurement 0.006 lower than male controls (p=0.034), and 
male controls had an epiphyseal extension measurement 0.026 
lower than the SFC cohort (p=0.049).
Adjusting for age and gender, individuals who play sport for 
a school or club team had an epiphyseal extension measure-
ment 0.017 greater than individuals who play no regular sport 
(p=0.043). Compared with those who play no regular sport, 
epiphyseal extension was 0.032 greater in individuals competing 
at a national or international level (p=0.022).
Adjusting for age and gender, there was no statistically signif-
icant association between epiphyseal extension and PAQ. There 
was no statistically significant association between epiphyseal 
extension and leg dominance when adjusting for age, gender, 
and activity level, although BMI nearly reached statistical signif-
icance (p=0.051).
Physeal tilt
With increasing age, physeal tilt decreased at 11 o’clock and 
12 o’clock (extension of inferior epiphysis relative to superior 
epiphysis) and increased at 2 o’clock and 3 o’clock (extension of 
anterior epiphysis relative to posterior epiphysis) (table 1). After 
physeal closure, physeal tilt was greatest at 1 o’clock and in the 
SFC cohort.
relationship between epiphyseal measurements and alpha 
angle
The strongest correlation between epiphyseal extension and 
cartilage alpha angle was at 1 o’clock, with progressively weaker 
correlations either side of this location. This relationship was

only seen in male participants. In the SFC cohort, 50% of the 
variability in cartilage alpha angle was explained by adjacent 
epiphyseal extension (p=0.043) (see online supplementary 
table S2).
The relationship between physeal tilt and cartilage alpha angle 
was limited. A positive correlation at 3 o’clock only reached 
statistical significance in the SFC cohort (p=0.014). This posi-
tive correlation indicates anterior relative to posterior epiphyseal 
extension with increasing alpha angles (opposite to that expected 
in slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE) (see online supplemen-
tary table S2).
Qualitative MrI morphology
Epiphyseal hypertrophy and extension was the most 
frequently observed source of cam morphology among 
study participants and was particularly prevalent among 
the SFC cohort beyond 14 years of age. Although usually 
most pronounced at 1 o’clock, this hypertrophy and 
extension was concurrently observed at adjacent positions 
(figure 4). No epiphyseal extension was observed in partic-
ipants aged 9 years, however, by 11 years of age there was 
often early extension that may progress to cam morphology 
(see online supplementary figure S4). Epiphyseal exten-
sion was rarely observed at 3 o’clock and 11 o’clock. Cam 
morphology at 3 o’clock was more frequently dictated by 
femoral neck retroversion and appeared independent of 
anterosuperior epiphyseal extension (see online supple-
mentary figure S5). Cam morphology at 11 o’clock and 12 
o’clock was frequently secondary to non-osseous tissue at 
the head-neck junction (see online supplementary figure S6).

dIsCussIOn
This study demonstrates that intense sporting activity during 
youth is associated with the development of cam morphology 
arising secondary to epiphyseal hypertrophy and extension 
along the anterosuperior femoral neck.
Age of cam development
Cam morphology was quantified using the alpha angle. 
The magnitude of alpha angle that represents pathological 
morphology is likely to depend on femoral morphology, acetab-
ular morphology, cartilage susceptibility and activity levels.19 
Alpha angles were uniform across all participants aged 9 
years; 
however, with increasing age there was an increasing range of 
alpha angle values consistent with cam development in a propor-
tion of individuals. Cartilage alpha angles increased as early as 
age 10 years and qualitatively this represented soft-tissue hyper-
trophy at the head-neck junction that we propose precedes 
extension of the ossified epiphysis. Bone alpha angles were never 
elevated secondary to cam morphology before age 12 years, as 
described in similar studies.3 5 This observation suggests that 
measurements confined to osseous morphology are insensitive 
to early cam development and explains why loss of internal rota-
tion precedes radiographic cam morphology (see online supple-
mentary figure S7).7
The greatest increase in cartilage alpha angle occurred between 
age 12 and 14 years, with no statistically significant increase 
beyond age 14 years. This suggests cam development precedes 
physeal closure, as concluded in comparable studies.3 5 7 There are 
studies that report higher alpha angles when the physis is open. 
We reproduced this observation when measuring bone rather 
than cartilage alpha angles at 2 o’clock and 3 o’clock. In the skel-
etally immature hip, the ossified femoral head is small relative 
to the metaphysis, giving rise to raised bone alpha angles that 
do not necessarily reflect cam morphology (see online supple-
mentary figure S8). Bone alpha angle measurements must be 
interpreted with caution in the immature skeleton.
Prevalence of cam morphology in females was insufficient to 
allow robust comparisons in age of cam development between 
sexes. Crucially, interventions to reduce the risk of cam develop-
ment should commence before age 10 years and may be ineffec-
tive beyond skeletal maturity.
Pathogenesis
Epiphyseal hypertrophy and extension represented the salient 
mechanism of cam development in this cohort. The greatest 
increase and absolute values of cartilage alpha angle and epiph-
yseal extension were at the 1 o’clock position, as in comparable 
studies.13 We demonstrate stronger correlations between epiph-
yseal extension and alpha angle than previously reported.15 
In males, 50% of the variability in cartilage alpha angle was 
explained by adjacent epiphyseal extension. This supports the 
proposal that epiphyseal extension is a salient mechanism of 
cam development, but not the sole mechanism. Importantly, 
our adopted measure of epiphyseal extension provides only 
limited assessment of epiphyseal morphology and is not sensi-
tive to epiphyseal hypertrophy without extension that also gives 
rise to cam morphology (see online supplementary figure S9). 
Active shape modelling is likely to provide improved assessment 
of epiphyseal morphology. The relationship between epiphyseal 
extension and alpha angle is particularly weak in females where 
alternative cam development pathogenesis may dominate, such 
as asphericity secondary to dysplasia.
Cam morphology at 3 o’clock appeared more frequently 
dictated by femoral neck retroversion than epiphyseal 
morphology; however, epiphysiel extension was responsible for 
the highest alpha angles. Retroversion was not formally quanti-
fied, but unlike epiphyseal extension, was evident among all age 
groups and we speculate a different pathogenesis. Interestingly, 
3 o’clock was the only position where epiphyseal tilt correlated 
with cartilage alpha angle, compatible with anterior epiphy-
seal extension as the cause of cam morphology. Our proposed 
explanation for the absence of correlation at superior clock-
face positions is variation in physis orientation in the coronal 
plane that is not seen in the axial plane. There was no qual-
itative or quantitative evidence of SUFE; however, epiphyseal 
changes may occur in response to stress across the physis without 
translation. Forces are greater with a more vertically orientated 
physis, which gives higher inferior epiphysiel extension values 
and counters increasing epiphyseal tilt measurements secondary 
to superior epiphyseal extension. Inferior epiphyseal extension 
was not associated with activity levels.
Associations with cam morphology
Cartilage alpha angle and epiphyseal extension were greater in 
males than females, as widely reported in general population 
cohorts.22 This gender difference remains unexplained. Interest-
ingly, the sex ratio for cam morphology is similar to SUFE,23 and 
perhaps the physis is more responsive to load in males. BMI was 
not associated with cartilage alpha angle or epiphyseal extension.
Activity levels were strongly associated with cartilage alpha angle 
and epiphyseal extension. There was a stepwise increase from 
participants who play no regular sport, to participants who play 
sport for a school or club, and then participants who compete at a 
national or international level. Some studies also found increased 
alpha angles4 and epiphyseal extension15 in athletes compared 
with controls, but others found no statistically significant differ-
ences, potentially due to insufficient statistical power.12 24 Our large 
cohort provides strong evidence that high activity levels during 
adolescence promote cam development secondary to epiphyseal 
extension with a dose-response relationship. This finding validates 
the proposed dose-response relationship between activity levels 
and cam morphology in other studies.3 25
Activity levels are challenging to quantify. In this study, compet-
itive level of sport participation was used as a surrogate measure 
of cumulative exercise intensity. General activity levels measured 
using the PAQ were not associated with cam morphology. PAQ is 
particularly responsive to exercise frequency and the limitation of 
this self-reported score for assessing sporting activity is illustrated 
by the significant decrease in PAQ with age among all study groups. 
Mean PAQ within the SFC cohort was 3.44 (SD 0.43) age 9–10 
years, 3.36 (SD 0.68) age 11–12 years, 2.98 (SD 0.74) age 13–14 
years, 2.51 (SD 0.66) age 15–16 years and 2.17 (SD 0.42) age 
17–18 years. However, training load for academy football players 
increases with age from approximately 5 to 8 
hours each week for 
under 9–12 years, 8–12 
hours each week for under 13–16 years, to 
greater than 12 
hours each week at under 18–23 years. Electronic 
activity trackers may aid future studies.
There was no difference in cartilage alpha angle or epiphy-
seal extension between dominant and non-dominant legs, repro-
ducing findings of a previous study.12 This observation counters 
hypotheses that kicking is responsible for cam formation by 
imparting forces across the physis that stimulate epiphyseal 
extension. Footballers are encouraged to kick with both feet, 
which may partially explain the finding; however, no difference 
was detected between control individuals who play kicking and

non-kicking sports. Repetitive high-intensity hip loading during 
sport played throughout a critical period of hip development 
may be the salient risk factor for cam development. Further 
research is required to determine whether similar adaptation to 
activity takes place within the acetabulum.
limitations
Study limitations include the demonstration of association rather 
than causality from this cross-sectional data. In addition, it is 
possible that the control group is not entirely representative of 
the general population as individuals who regularly participate 
in sport may be more likely to volunteer for projects investi-
gating effects of exercise. Nevertheless, there were statistically 
significant differences in hip morphology between the control 
and athlete cohorts. Alpha angle has a low positive predictive 
value for future pain and osteoarthritis, hence the clinical rele-
vance of our findings remains unclear, but will be addressed with 
the longitudinal element of the study.
COnClusIOns
Intense sporting activity during adolescence is associated 
with cam morphology secondary to epiphyseal hypertrophy 
and extension along the anterosuperior femoral neck. Cam 
morphology is first evident as cartilaginous hypertrophy age 
10 years. The pathogenesis of cam development currently 
remains insufficiently understood to recommend activity 
modification. The known cardiovascular and health benefits of 
exercise outweigh potentially adverse effects on hip develop-
ment. However, males participating in high-level sports during 
adolescence are at particularly elevated risk of developing cam 
morphology and secondary hip pathology.
What are the findings?
 
► Osseous cam morphology is preceded by cartilaginous 
hypertrophy at the femoral head-neck junction. This 
appearance is first evident at 10 years of age.
 
► Sporting activity during adolescence is strongly associated 
with the development of cam morphology with a dose-
response relationship. The salient mechanism is epiphyseal 
hypertrophy and extension along the anterosuperior femoral 
neck.
 
► Cam morphology is significantly more prevalent in males. 
General activity levels, leg dominance and kicking sports are 
not independently associated with cam morphology.
 
► Males participating in competitive sport during adolescence 
are at particularly elevated risk of developing cam 
morphology.
how might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
 
► A history of competitive sport during adolescence is strongly 
associated with cam morphology. Clinicians should be alert 
to the risk of secondary hip pathology.
 
► MRI is recommended to diagnose cam morphology in 
skeletally immature individuals as early non-osseous cam 
morphology may not be evident on radiographs.
 
► Proposed interventions to prevent the development of cam 
morphology should commence prior to 10 years of age.
