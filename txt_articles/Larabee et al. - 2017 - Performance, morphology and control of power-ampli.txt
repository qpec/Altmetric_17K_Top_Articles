Performance, morphology and control of power-amplified
mandibles in the trap-jaw ant Myrmoteras
(Hymenoptera: Formicidae)
Fredrick J. Larabee1,2,*, Wulfila Gronenberg3 and Andrew V. Suarez2,4,5
ABSTRACT
Trap-jaw ants are characterized by high-speed mandibles used for
prey
capture
and
defense.
Power-amplified
mandibles
have
independently evolved at least four times among ants, with each
lineage using different structures as a latch, spring and trigger. We
examined two species from the genus Myrmoteras (subfamily
Formicinae), whose morphology is unique among trap-jaw ant
lineages, and describe the performance characteristics, spring-
loading mechanism and neuronal control of Myrmoteras strikes.
Like other trap-jaw ants, Myrmoteras latch their jaws open while the
large closer muscle loads potential energy in a spring. The latch
differs from other lineages and is likely formed by the co-contraction of
the mandible opener and closer muscles. The cuticle of the posterior
margin of the head serves as a spring, and is deformed by
approximately 6% prior to a strike. The mandibles are likely
unlatched by a subgroup of closer muscle fibers with particularly
short sarcomeres. These fast fibers are controlled by two large motor
neurons whose dendrites overlap with terminals of large sensory
neurons originating from labral trigger hairs. Upon stimulation of the
trigger hairs, the mandibles shut in as little as 0.5 ms and at peak
velocities that are comparable with other trap-jaw ants, but with much
slower acceleration. The estimated power output of the mandible
strike (21 kW kg−1) confirms that Myrmoteras jaws are indeed power
amplified. However, the power output of Myrmoteras mandibles is
significantly lower than distantly related trap-jaw ants using different
spring-loading mechanisms, indicating a relationship between power-
amplification mechanism and performance.

INTRODUCTION
Speed is a fundamental performance trait and has a large impact on
individual fitness by influencing predator–prey interactions (Walker
et al., 2005; Watkins, 1996), dispersal distance (Fisher, 2005) and
even mating success (Parsons, 1974). The speed of most animal
appendages is determined by the intrinsic power limit of the muscles
that generate those movements (Josephson, 1993). However, many
animals have overcome these constraints by incorporating latches
and elastic elements into their appendage systems and amplifying
the power output of their muscles. Spring-loading legs, mouthparts
and other body parts allow animals to amplify muscle power output,
building up potential energy over the course of seconds or longer,
and releasing it in milliseconds (Gronenberg, 1996a; Higham and
Irschick, 2013; Patek et al., 2011). Power amplification is used
extensively by ambush predators to catch prey and by escaping prey
to generate very large accelerations to avoid being caught. Among
the champions of power-amplified movements are the ‘trap-jaw’
ants, which generate some of the highest-velocity appendage
movements ever recorded for an animal (Patek et al., 2006; Spagna
et al., 2008).
Considering the diversity and ecological dominance of ants, it is
not surprising that they have evolved power amplification. It is
remarkable, however, that in a single insect family, trap-jaw
mandibles have evolved independently at least four times for
predation and defense (reviewed in Larabee and Suarez, 2014). All
trap-jaw ant lineages use a similar catapult mechanism, but have
adapted different structures to act as the latch, spring and trigger.
Ants
in
the
genera
Strumigenys
and
Daceton
(subfamily
Myrmicinae), for example, have specialized labra that block
and release the mandibles (Gronenberg, 1996b). A second lineage
of trap-jaw ants in the subfamily Myrmicinae (the genus
Acanthognathus) use specialized accessory processes at the base
of the mandibles to lock them open and a modified closer muscle
that releases a strike (Gronenberg et al., 1998a). Trap-jaw ants in the
genera Anochetus and Odontomachus (subfamily Ponerinae) have a
modified mandible insertion that locks the jaws open during muscle
loading, and a specialized fast trigger muscle that unlocks the
mandibles from the joint and allows them to close (Gronenberg,
1995a,b). Given their extreme performance and morphological
diversity, trap-jaw ants are an excellent system for examining the
convergent evolution of complex morphological adaptations and
the relationship between power-amplification mechanisms and
performance.
Relating different power-amplification strategies to performance
output in ants is currently limited by gaps in our understanding of
mandible morphology and strike kinematics for several important
lineages, particularly the genus Myrmoteras. This relatively small
genus [41 species (www.antcat.org)] is the only lineage of trap-jaw
ants in the subfamily Formicinae, and their ecology and behavior are
poorly understood. They display a combination of traits that are
similar to other trap-jaw ants, but it is unclear how, or even if, their
mouthparts are power amplified. Like other trap-jaw ants, they have
long thin mandibles that are equipped with well-developed teeth
along the inner margin and can be opened much wider than is the
case in other trap-jaw ant genera, to 280 deg (Fig. 1). Their

 mandibles are particularly long, yet slender and spiny, compared
with most other trap-jaw ants, suggesting that they are not used to
stun but to rapidly impale and hold prey. Also, the head of
Myrmoteras is modified to accommodate a large mandible closer
muscle that could power the mandible strike (Paul, 2001). Finally,
their diet is similar to other predators with power-amplified
mouthparts, consisting mostly of fast escaping prey, such as
Collembolans (Moffett, 1985, 1986), suggestive that they may have
convergently evolved latch, spring and trigger structures to power
very fast mandible movements. Given the uncertainty of the
functional morphology of their mouthparts and their distant
phylogenetic relationship to other trap-jaw ants, examining
Myrmoteras
morphology
and
mandible
performance
could
contribute to a better understanding of how power amplification
has convergently evolved in ants.
The aim of the present study was to examine the kinematic
performance, morphology and control of Myrmoteras trap jaws and
better understand the repeated evolution of spring-loaded mandibles
in ants. Specifically, we addressed three questions about the
mandible
mechanism
of
Myrmoteras.
First,
how
fast
are
Myrmoteras mandibles and are they spring loaded? Second, what
is the internal morphology of the mandible mechanism and, in
particular, what are the latch, spring and trigger structures and the
neural tissue that control mandible movement? Finally, how does
the performance output of Myrmoteras strikes compare with other
trap-jaw ant lineages whose strike performance has been studied?
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study organism
Two colonies of Myrmoteras barbouri (Creighton, 1930) and two
colonies of Myrmoteras iriodum (Moffett, 1985) were collected
from Maliau Basin Conservation Area, in Sabah, Malaysia in
August 2014. Colonies ranged from 10 to 25 workers and three
included queens. In the lab, artificial nests were kept in plastic boxes
coated with Fluon (Northern Products, Woonsocket, RI, USA), and
plaster-filled Petri dishes served as nest chambers. Ants were given
water and sugar ad libitum and fed live termites or frozen crickets
three times a week. All colonies were kept at 25°C and a 12 h:12 h
light:dark cycle.
High-speed videography
High-speed videography was used to visualize the loading phase of
mandible strikes and to measure strike performance for workers of
M. barbouri and M. iriodum. Ants were restrained to the end of a #3
insect pin on the dorsal surface of the head with dental wax (Kerr
Laboratory Products, Orange, CA, USA). Care was taken to avoid
gluing any part of the posterior portion of the head or anywhere on
the occipital lobe. The pin was fitted onto a micromanipulator and
mandible strikes were elicited with gentle puffs of air. Strikes were
filmed with one of two camera arrangements. To record the loading
phase of the snap, ants were filmed at 1000 frames s−1 with a
512-PCI camera (Photron, San Diego, CA, USA) with an MP-E
65 mm macro lens (Canon USA, Melville, NY, USA). To measure
the kinematics of the mandibles during a strike, the ants were
magnified with a SteREO Discovery V20 stereomicroscope (Zeiss
Oberkochen, Germany) and backlit with an LED light (Visual
Instrumentation Corp., Lancaster, CA, USA). Magnified trap-jaw
strikes were recorded with a Phantom v9.1 high-speed camera
(Vision Research Inc., Wayne, NJ, USA) with frame rates between
2×104 and 6×104 frames s−1 and a shutter speed of 2 µs.
Ants were frozen at −20°C to prevent drying and their wet mass was
recorded within 1 week of filming. Additionally, the wet mass of each
mandible, head width and length, and mandible length were recorded.
Linear measurements were made with a Semprex Micro-DRO digital
stage micrometer (Semprex Corp., Campbell, CA, USA) connected to
a Leica MZ 12.5 stereomicroscope. Masses were measured with a
UMX2 microbalance (Mettler-Toledo, Leicester, UK).

kinematics,

individuals
(three
M. barbouri and four M. iriodum) were filmed and 3–6 strikes
were recorded from each individual. Strike trajectories were digitized

 in ImageJ by tracking the x–y coordinates of the distal tip of each
mandible throughout the strike. The angular displacement of the
mandible, θ, was calculated from the x–y coordinate data and length
of the mandible, r. Cumulative displacement was fitted with a quintic
spline using the Pspline package in R v3.2.2 (http://www.R-project.
org/), and instantaneous angular velocity, ω, and acceleration, α, were
calculated as the first and second derivatives of the curve-fit
displacement data, respectively. Linear velocity and acceleration
were calculated by multiplying angular data by mandible length.
To calculate the average mass-specific muscle power required to
produce the observed mandible accelerations, each mandible was
modeled as a uniform rod rotating about a fixed point at its end with
a moment of inertia, I:
I ¼ 1
3 mr2;
ð1Þ
where m is the mass of the mandible and r is mandible length. The
kinetic energy of the mandible, Ek, was calculated as:
Ek ¼ 1
2 Iv2;
ð2Þ
where ω is the maximum angular velocity of the mandible. The
average mass-specific power, P, was then calculated as:
P ¼
Ek;max
tE;maxMadduct
;
ð3Þ
taking Ek,max as the maximum kinetic energy of the mandible during
the strike, tE,max as the time it takes to reach the maximum kinetic
energy and Madduct as the estimated mass of the mandible closer
muscle. The mandible closer muscle was estimated as one-half of
wet head mass. This is an overestimate of the muscle mass, but
results in a conservative estimate of the mass-specific power
required for the mandible strike.
Maximum individual performance was measured for each
kinematic parameter and was calculated from the videos recorded
for each individual. Strike performance was compared with published
values for two other species of trap-jaw ant: Odontomachus chelifer
and Odontomachus ruginodis (Spagna et al., 2008).
Microtomography
X-ray microtomography (microCT) and stereomicroscopy were
used to examine the internal and external morphology, respectively,
of the mandible apparatus of M. iriodum. MicroCT allows efficient
and non-destructive imaging of internal organization of muscles as
well as 3D reconstruction of biological structures (Metscher, 2009).
Two sample preparations were scanned with microCT: one with
closed jaws and one with jaws held open with nylon thread prior to
fixation. Ants were fixed in alcoholic Bouin’s solution for 2 days,
gradually dehydrated in an ethanol series (70, 80, 90, 95, 100 and
100% with 20 min between changes) and finally critical-point
dried. Heads were affixed to wooden dowels with low-melting-point
dental wax (Kerr Laboratory Products). MicroCT was performed
with an Xradia MicroXCT-400 (Carl Zeiss X-ray Microscopy, Inc.,
Pleasanton, CA, USA) at the Imaging Technology Group at the
Beckman Institute (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL,
USA). The voltage and power of the X-ray beam were set to 40 keV
and 4 W, respectively. Specimens were rotated 180 deg, with
images taken every 0.25 deg. Between 720 and 745 projections were
acquired with a 10× objective (exposure 10–15 s image–1) while
rotating the specimen 180 deg. Tomographic reconstruction was
performed in XMReconstructor 8.1, and resulted in image stacks
with voxel sizes of 1.87 µm (closed mandibles) and 2.04 µm (open
mandibles). Volume renderings, cross-sections and surface models
were produced in Amira 5.5.0 (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA). Image
stacks of microCT scans have been uploaded to MorphoSource
(www.morphosource.org).
Histology
To reveal the striation pattern and innervation of the mandible closer
muscle, the mandibles, antennae and small parts of the head cuticle
were removed and the heads were then fixed in 4% buffered
formaldehyde for 24 h, repeatedly rinsed in phosphate buffer,
impregnated with 1% osmium tetroxide solution for 6 h at 4°C,
rinsed, dehydrated in dimethoxypropane, embedded in Spurr’s
medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) via
acetone, polymerized, and sectioned at 15 µm. To stain motor
neurons, a hole was poked through the head cuticle and a small crystal
of a fluorescent tracer (Fluoro Ruby, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR,
USA) was placed into the closer muscle using a minuten pin. The
hole in the head capsule was then sealed and the dye was allowed to
be retrogradely transported by the damaged neurons into the central
nervous system overnight. To label sensory axons, the long trigger
hairs on the labrum were broken off and Fluoro Ruby was applied to
their slightly damaged sockets and sealed with petrol jelly. Ants were
kept overnight for anterograde tracer transport. Brains containing
labeled neurons were fixed, embedded and sectioned as described
above (except for osmium impregnation). Brains were photographed
under an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiophot and SPOT
Flex Diagnostic Instruments).
RESULTS
Mandible strike kinematics
Observations in the lab confirm that Myrmoteras behave like other
trap-jaw ants, using their long mandibles to disable prey. When
provided with termites, the ants approached with their mandibles
open at an angle of 280 deg and, when in range, shut them
seemingly instantaneously to smash their prey. Like other trap-jaw
ants, filming jaw strikes at 1000 frames s−1 failed to resolve the full
motion of the mandible during a strike, indicating that the mandibles
shut in less than 1 ms (see Movie 1).
The entire mandible movement during a strike was resolved when
filmed at frame rates above 2×104 frames s−1 (Fig. 2, Movie 2). The
body mass of M. iriodum was 60% larger than M. barbouri
(Welch’s t-test: P<0.001), but there was no difference in minimum
strike duration, maximum angular velocity or average power
(Welch’s t-test: duration, P=0.25; velocity, P=0.50; average
power, P=0.54) (Table 1). In the following discussion, strike
performance for M. barbouri and M. iriodum are pooled. The
average duration of a strike was 0.58±0.27 ms (mean±s.d.) with a
minimum observed duration of 0.12 ms. The mandibles accelerated
slowly through the beginning of the strike until they reached peak
velocity about three quarters through the trajectory, at which point
they decelerated rapidly (Fig. 2A). Peak angular velocities ranged
from 9.23×103 rad s−1 to 1.41×104 rad s−1 and the estimated peak
accelerations were on the order of 104 g. There was no difference
between the left and right mandible in peak angular velocity (paired
t-test: t=1.091, d.f.=16, P=0.291) or acceleration (paired t-test:
t=1.594, d.f.=16, P=0.131). The average mass-specific power
output of the mandible strike was 21.4±7.1 kW kg−1, two orders of
magnitude greater than what is possible from direct muscle action
(Josephson, 1993). To generate the observed power output,
Myrmoteras is likely employing a spring-loading mechanism.
There was a significant difference in strike duration and peak
angular velocity among the trap-jaw ant species tested (one-way

 ANOVA duration: F2,13=11.5, P<0.001; velocity: F2,13=123,
P<0.001). Myrmoteras strikes were significantly longer than both
the large-bodied O. chelifer (Tukey post hoc comparison: P<0.01)
and the smaller, similarly sized, O. ruginodis (P<0.001). However,
the longer strikes resulted in lower peak strike speeds only compared
with O. ruginodis (P<0.001) (Fig. 3A). Myrmoteras and O. chelifer
had peak angular velocities that were approximately half the speed
of O. ruginodis. Unlike Myrmoteras, Odontomachus mandible
strikes accelerated and decelerated very quickly. The power output
of Myrmoteras strikes was significantly smaller than both species of
Odontomachus (one-way ANOVA: F2,13=58.4, P<0.001), being
about one-quarter and one-tenth the amount of O. chelifer and
O. ruginodis, respectively (Tukey post hoc comparison: versus
O. chelifer, P=0.003; vs O. ruginodis, P<0.001) (Fig. 3B).
Morphology of Myrmoteras spring-loading apparatus
Virtual sections, volume renderings and surface models from
microCT data provided visualization of the complete mouthpart
apparatus of Myrmoteras, including external cuticular features and
internal musculature (Figs 4–8, Movies 3 and 4). Visualizations
from microCT were also compared with serial sections of
photomicrographs from a study on glandular structures, and the
general morphological features were the same (Billen et al., 2015;
J. Billen, personal communication).
As stated previously, Myrmoteras mandibles are thin and long
(approximately 1.5 times longer than the head). The mandible base is
widened dorsoventrally and has a deep notch on its lateral margin that
allows the mandibles to open to 280 deg (Figs 1, 5, 6). Without this
notch, opening the mandibles to their full extent would be obstructed
by the pleurostoma, the area of the lateral side of the head adjacent to
the mandible joint. The proximal base of the mandible also has a
complicated three-dimensional shape including invaginations and a
prominent mediobasal process that protrudes posteriorly when the
mandibles are in a closed position (Figs 1, 2, 8).
Similar to other dicondylous insects, Myrmoteras mandibles
operate as a hinge with a single degree of freedom and are each
controlled primarily by two muscles (Figs 4, 5). A large closer
(adductor) muscle inserts medially on the mandible and occupies
most of the dorsal and posterior volume of the head. A smaller
opener (abductor) muscle inserts onto the lateral side of the
mandible base and is located ventromedially. Contraction of either
of these muscles causes the mandible to rotate around the axis

 formed by the pleurostomal (dorsal) and mandibular (ventral)
condyles (Fig. 1). Like in other ants, the mandible closer muscle is
the largest structure in the head, filling approximately 25% of the
head volume, including all of the enlarged occipital lobe on the
posterior margin of the head. In contrast to the large closer muscle,
the opener muscle only occupies 2.5% of the head volume. The next
largest structures in the head were the brain and eyes, which take up
a combined volume of 12% of the head capsule.
The muscles are connected to the mandible by apodemes, highly
sclerotized cuticular tissue that acts similar to the vertebrate tendon.
The mandible closer (adductor) apodeme attaches broadly to the
medial side of the mandible base, as a thin sheet dorsally and as a
thick fiber on the mediobasal process (Figs 1, 6, 7). The main body
of the apodeme is a thick, heavily sclerotized fiber approximately
50 µm in diameter. The posterior part of the apodeme base is funnel
shaped and receives multiple fibrous attachments of the closer
muscle (Figs 5, 7). When the mandibles are in the open position, the
thin sheet of the closer apodeme wraps dorsally around the mandible
base to the lateral side when they are in the open position (Fig. 7).
The abductor (opener) apodeme attaches to the lateral base of the
mandible, just proximal to the mandibular notch.
The complicated shape of the mandible base and the large
opening angle of the mandible has a large impact on the relative
lengths of the mandible opener and closer muscle moment arms
(Fig. 7). In the open position, the line of action of the closer muscle
is almost directly in line with the mandible joint pivot. The base of
the mandible even has a groove that allows the closer apodeme to
rest between the two condyles that form the axis of mandible
rotation (Fig. 7). Consequently, the mandible closer muscle likely
has a very small moment arm, the distance between the mandible
joint and the line of action of the muscle force, allowing it to
generate a large amount of force without much torque on the
mandible. In contrast, the moment arm of the opener muscle is
relatively long when the mandibles are wide open. Co-contraction of
the opener and closer muscles could be responsible for locking the
mandibles open prior to a strike.
The mandible closer muscle is made up of two separate muscles
that differ in their attachment location, geometry and fiber
composition (Figs 5–8). The ‘slow closer’ muscle originates
broadly
from
the
posterior
margin
of
the
head
and
is
approximately four times larger than the ‘fast closer’. All the slow
muscle fibers attach at a single location on the dorsal side of the
closer apodeme very close to the sheet portion of the apodeme. The
fast closer muscle surrounds the slow closer muscle, and originates
on the ventral and lateral wall of the head capsule. The fast muscle
fibers are attached to the closer apodeme via filaments along the
funnel portion of its main body. The two muscles also differ greatly
in the sarcomere lengths of their fibers (Fig. 8) [fast closer fibers:
2.6±0.26 µm (n=18 fibers measured); slow closer fibers: 10.3±
1.4 µm (n=33 fibers measured)]. The differences in sarcomere
length are highly significant (Student’s t-test: P<10−14). In the
absence of electrophysiological evidence, sarcomere length can be
used as a proxy for muscle contraction speed (Gronenberg et al.,

 1997) and is the basis of the two closer muscle names. The fast
closer fibers are comparable in sarcomere length to fast fibers
described for other ants with fast mandible muscles, whereas the
slow fibers have longer sarcomeres than previously described for
any ant (Gronenberg et al., 1997) or, in fact, for insects in general
(Nation, 2008), which would render these muscle fibers particularly
slow yet forceful (Jahromi and Atwood, 1969).
While the mandibles are in the open and locked position,
contraction of the slow but powerful opener muscle could load
potential energy to power the mandible strike in elastic elements of
the head. High-speed videos demonstrate that the posterior margin
of the head, especially medially at the occipital lobe, compresses
during the 5–10 s prior to a strike (Fig. 8 and Movie 1). The occipital
lobe is a specialized structure on the occiput in Myrmoteras and is
delimited by a deep groove, which we are calling the nuchal groove
(Fig. 1). This groove may play an important role in energy storage
for spring loading by being the site of flexion during the contraction
of the slow closer muscle. By examining high-speed videos of
mandible strikes, we estimated that the posterior margin of the head
compresses by 6±3.0% (n=4) immediately prior to the mandible
strike. The apodeme sheet that wraps around the dorsal surface of
the mandible base also compresses prior to a strike (Movie 1), which
may indicate that the apodeme itself might contribute to elastic
energy storage, as has been suggested in other trap-jaw ants
(Gronenberg, 1995a,b).
Triggering the release of the mandibles from their locked position
probably depends on the fast closer muscles. These muscles attach
to the posterior funnel portion of the closer apodeme, and their

 contraction would change the direction of pull of the closer
apodeme on the mandible to be more ventrolateral and also
increases the force applied to the mandible. The short sarcomeres
that make up these muscle fibers indicate that they are optimized for
speed (Günzel et al., 1993; Paul and Gronenberg, 1999), and would
ensure that the unlatching happens rapidly.
Control of the mandible strike
Once the ant has detected prey or is otherwise prepared to strike, the
mandible strike in Myrmoteras is triggered upon contact of the labral
trigger hairs with the prey item (in the videos, the strike is released
by an air puff against the trigger hairs). Deflection of a trigger hair
presumably leads to the activation of a sensory neuron that supplies
a remarkably thick axon (axon diameter in the labral nerve estimated
from fluorescent fills: ca. 3.2 µm; Fig. 9A,B) and is thus presumably
particularly fast conducting. This neuron (one on either side)
provides thick, blebbed terminal collaterals in the anterior part of
the subesophageal ganglion (Fig. 9B). Many of these terminals
coincide with territory occupied by the dendrites (Fig. 9D) of
particularly thick motor neurons (two on either side; axon diameter
in nerve: 6.9 and 7.9 µm, respectively), which project through a side
branch of the mandibular nerve (Fig. 9C) to supply the fast mandible
closer muscle. The slow mandible closer muscle is supplied by
another branch of the mandibular nerve (Fig. 9C), which does not
carry any unusually large axons. Although our tracer studies did not
allow us to establish synaptic connectivity, based on the surprisingly
large diameter of the involved axons we propose that the thick labial
sensory neurons and the thick motor neurons are synaptically
connected to give rise to a particularly fast monosynaptic pathway
as has been shown for the sensory-motor pathway controlling the

of the slow closer muscle (lAdM) is much smaller than the opener muscle (lAbM). Contraction of the fast closer muscle (FfAdM) changes the direction of pull
on the mandible by the closer apodeme, increases the closer muscle moment arm and allows the mandibles to begin to rotate. As the mandible continues rotating,
the moment arm of the closer muscle increases due to the length of the mediobasal process, and results in increased acceleration of the mandibles to quickly
accelerate shut.

 trap-jaw reflex in the ant genus Odontomachus (Gronenberg,
1995b).
DISCUSSION
Proposed catapult mechanism
High-speed videography confirmed that Myrmoteras mandibles are
spring loaded and produce much more power than can be explained
by direct muscle action alone. By comparing surface renderings of
Myrmoteras mouthparts with open and closed mandibles, we
identified potential latch, spring and trigger components of the
power-amplification mechanism and propose a neuronal pathway
controlling the jaw strike (Fig. 8B,C). The basic catapult mechanism
is similar to that found in other spring-loaded systems (Bennet-
Clark, 1975; Gronenberg, 1996a; Patek et al., 2011). A latch formed
from the antagonistic contraction of the mandible opener (abductor)
muscle allows the slow, but powerful, closer (adductor) muscle to
store potential energy in cuticular elements of the head and closer
apodeme. Stimulation of the labral trigger hairs presumably
activates
the
monosynaptic
triggering
pathway
that
causes
contraction of the fast mandible closer muscle, whose shortening
increases the leverage on the mandible joint and allows stored
energy generated from the slow closer muscle to be applied to the
mandible joint, resulting in rapid closing of the mandibles.
Contraction of the fast closer muscle may be accompanied by the
relaxation of the opener muscle to improve the relative moment-arm
advantage of the closer muscle. Because these inferences have been
made solely from morphological examination, the proposed
mechanism must be considered a hypothesis until additional data
from electrophysiology or additional high-speed videography can
be collected.
Although the slow closer muscle generates the force required to
close the mandibles, a spring is necessary to store the potential
energy that is responsible for the rapid movement of the mandible
strike. Based on the exceptionally large sarcomere length of its
fibers (Gronenberg et al., 1997), it appears that this muscle should
be extraordinarily slow contracting yet generate particularly large
forces, as would be expected of a spring-loaded system. In
Myrmoteras, several structures likely act as a spring, including the
cuticle of the posterior margin of the head, which compresses in
response to the contraction of the closer muscle in the seconds
before a strike. The potential energy stored in the occipital lobe is
passed to the mandible through the closer muscle and apodeme
when the latch is released (Fig. 8). Assuming the closer muscle stays
contracted for the 0.5 ms duration of a strike, the shortened muscle
would be pulled by the deflected lobe and result in the rapid rotation
of the mandible. Other elastic elements in the head also might play
an energy storage role, including the closer apodeme and the muscle
itself. Additional work will be required to determine the relative
contribution of each of these elements to elastic energy storage.
The difficulty of finding Myrmoteras colonies in the field and the
small number of individuals per colony limited the number of
individuals we were able to study. As a consequence, there are several
aspects of the mandible function that we could not examine, in
particular the neural control and temporal activity of the mandible
muscle. In other trap-jaw lineages, the large mandible closer muscle
contracts slowly prior to a strike. The strike is released when trigger
hairs are stimulated mechanically, which activates a fast trigger
muscle responsible for unlocking the mandibles and allowing them to
rotate shut (Gronenberg, 1996b; Gronenberg et al., 1998a; Just and
Gronenberg, 1999). The trigger muscles are regulated by large-
diameter sensory and motor neurons and form a very fast
monosynaptic reflex. We assume that the same neuronal principles
underlie the strike in Myrmoteras, and our high-speed videos and
morphological examination suggest a similar mechanical scenario;
however, without electrophysiological recordings of muscle activity,
the temporal properties of muscle activation remain unclear.
Uncertainty in the role that trigger hairs play in activating the trap-
jaw reflex also comes from comparisons with other Myrmoteras
species. The two species that we examined, M. barbouri and
M. iriodum, have well-developed labral trigger hairs, but most species
(all in the subgenus Myagroteras) lack them (Moffett, 1985; http://
antcat.org). Given the large eyes of Myrmoteras, visual cues may also

 be involved in releasing the mandible strike. The mandible strike of
Odontomachus trap-jaw ants can still be released when their trigger
hairs are removed (Carlin and Gladstein, 1989; Mohan and Spagna,
2015). It may be that Myrmoteras also uses several senses to trigger
their strikes.
Comparison with trap-jaw ants and other power-amplified
movements
The spring-loading mechanism of Myrmoteras mandibles is unique
among the four independent lineages of trap-jaw ant. Comparing the
morphology and
kinematics
of
these
convergently evolved
strategies reveals the performance consequences of different
power-amplification mechanisms. For example, the unlatching
mechanism of Myrmoteras may be responsible for the slower
acceleration of its mandible strike compared with Odontomachus
trap-jaw ants (Fig. 2). All trap-jaw lineages, including Myrmoteras,
use muscles composed of fast contracting fibers to unlock their jaws
yet slow (hence forceful) muscle fibers to power the spring
mechanism (Gronenberg, 1995a, 1996b; Gronenberg et al., 1998a;
Just and Gronenberg, 1999). In other lineages, however, the trigger
muscle is decoupled from the function of the closer muscle,
unblocking the labrum in dacetines, or removing the mandible
condyle from a notch in Anochetus and Odontomachus. In
Myrmoteras, the fast and slow closer muscles are attached to the
same apodeme, and the fast closer muscle supplements the torque
applied to the mandible by the slow closer muscle. Rotating the
mandibles from such a large angle may partially explain why the
acceleration of Myrmoteras mandibles is so much slower than either
O. chelifer or O. ruginodis.
Similarly, differences in spring morphology may also explain
some of the kinematic differences between trap-jaw lineages.
Anochetus and Odontomachus store potential energy mainly in a
highly
sclerotized
hook-shaped
mandible
closer
apodeme
(Gronenberg, 1995a). The closer apodeme of Myrmoteras, on the
other hand, is funnel shaped, which may not have the same spring
mechanics as Odontomachus. Additionally, the cuticle of the
posterior margin of the head in Myrmoteras may not be as efficient a
spring as the ponerine trap-jaw ant spring, owing to it being less stiff
and not directly connected to the mandible. Consequently, this may
be responsible for the lower peak velocities measured for
Myrmoteras strikes. Morphological and mechanical differences in
spring structures have been found to determine performance
differences in other spring-loaded appendages, such as in mantis
shrimp (Patek et al., 2013; Rosario and Patek, 2015).
Our kinematic data demonstrates that Myrmoteras mandible
strikes are not on the same allometric scale as Odontomachus. The
speed of ponerine trap-jaw strikes display a negative allometric
relationship with body size (Spagna et al., 2008; F.J.L., unpublished
data). There was no difference in strike performance between the
two species of Myrmoteras we examined, despite a significant
difference
in
body
size.
Compared
with
two
species
of
Odontomachus, the minimum strike duration of Myrmoteras was
much longer. Likewise, peak velocity in Myrmoteras was lower
than the similarly sized O. ruginodis. Comparison with other trap-
jaw ant genera that have been examined (Acanthognathus, Daceton
or Strumigenys) was not possible because only maximum strike
durations could be estimated for those genera (Gronenberg, 1996b;
Gronenberg et al., 1998a).
The estimated power output of Myrmoteras strikes was
approximately 21 kW kg−1, which is significantly lower than
other
trap-jaw ants
for
which
data
is
available
(Fig.
3).
Odontomachus chelifer and O. ruginodis, which use a different
power-amplification mechanism than Myrmoteras, have power
outputs 4 and 10 times greater than Myrmoteras. Other arthropods
with power-amplified predatory or defensive strikes, such as trap-
jaw spiders (Wood et al., 2016), smashing mantis shrimp (Patek
et al., 2004) and snapping termite soldiers (Seid et al., 2008), also
have between 3 and 500 times more powerful strikes than
Myrmoteras. In contrast, the predatory strikes of Myrmoteras are
2 to 10 times more powerful than the power-amplified jumps of
some saltatorial arthropods, such as fleas (Bennet-Clark and Lucey,
1967; Sutton and Burrows, 2011), locusts (Bennet-Clark, 1975) and
springtails (Brackenbury and Hunt, 1993). In these cases, however,
the jumping mechanisms are accelerating the entire body mass of
the animal, rather than just a limb, resulting in the work being
performed over a longer period of time (i.e. lower power output).
Complicating this interpretation, however, are the exceptionally
powerful jumps of flea beetles (Brackenbury and Wang, 1995) and
froghoppers (Burrows, 2006), which amplify power to a similar
extent as Myrmoteras mandible strikes.
The reduced strike performance of Myrmoteras may partly be
explained by the function and morphology of their mandibles, which
are longer and thinner compared with Odontomachus. Myrmoteras
use their strikes for specialized predation of soft-bodied springtails,
whose spring-loaded escape jumps occur between 10 and 50 ms after
contact with a stimulus (Hopkin, 1997). This is well within the
average strike duration we recorded for Myrmoteras strikes. In
addition to catching fast and dangerous prey, the trap jaws of
Odontomachus are also used to power escape jumps that increase
their survival rate during interactions with predators (Larabee and
Suarez, 2015; Patek et al., 2006; Spagna et al., 2009). The mandibles
of Odontomachus are shorter and more robust than Myrmoteras jaws,
likely as a result of the mechanical demands required to withstand the
large accelerations and forces that power their escape jumps.
Myrmoteras mandibles or teeth may break if they experienced
equivalent accelerations or forces when closing on a hard object.
Interestingly, many of the other trap-jaw ant genera have similarly
thin and long mandibles (Acanthognathus, and many Strumigenys
species), but probably do not typically display escape jump behavior.
The unique mandible mechanism employed by Myrmoteras trap-
jaw ants highlights the evolutionary success of spring-loaded
appendages. Trap-jaws have evolved at least four times in ants, and
at least two other lineages (Mystrium and Plectrotena) employ
spring-loaded ‘snapping jaws’ to amplify the force of their
mandibles (Dejean et al., 2002; Gronenberg et al., 1998b). The
repeated evolution of spring-loaded mandibles is an example of how
speed has had a large impact on predator–prey interactions in
terrestrial arthropod communities. Given the number of insects that
employ rapid spring-loaded escape behaviors as antipredation
adaptations (crickets, springtails, click-beetles), it is not surprising
that a dominant predator group, such as ants, has repeatedly evolved
high-performance specializations that overcome the physical
limitation on predation speed.
