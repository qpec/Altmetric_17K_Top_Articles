Abstract.
Background: It remains controversial whether hormone therapy in recently postmenopausal women modifies the risk of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Objective: To investigate the effects of hormone therapy on amyloid-� deposition in recently postmenopausal women.
Methods: Participants within 5–36 months past menopause in the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study, a randomized,
double blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial, were randomized to: 1) 0.45 mg/day oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE);
2) 50 �g/day transdermal 17�-estradiol; or 3) placebo pills and patch for four years. Oral progesterone (200 mg/day) was
given to active treatment groups for 12 days each month. 11C Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET imaging was performed
in 68 of the 118 participants at Mayo Clinic approximately seven years post randomization and three years after stopping
randomized treatment. PiB Standard unit value ratio (SUVR) was calculated.
Results: Women (age = 52–65) randomized to transdermal 17�-estradiol (n = 21) had lower PiB SUVR compared to placebo
(n = 30) after adjusting for age [odds ratio (95%CI) = 0.31(0.11–0.83)]. In the APOE �4 carriers, transdermal 17�-estradiol
treated women (n = 10) had lower PiB SUVR compared to either placebo (n = 5) [odds ratio (95%CI) = 0.04(0.004–0.44)], or
the oral CEE treated group (n = 3) [odds ratio (95%CI) = 0.01(0.0006–0.23)] after adjusting for age. Hormone therapy was
not associated with PiB SUVR in the APOE �4 non-carriers.
Conclusion: In this pilot study, transdermal 17�-estradiol therapy in recently postmenopausal women was associated with
a reduced amyloid-� deposition, particularly in APOE �4 carriers. This finding may have important implications for the
prevention of AD in postmenopausal women, and needs to be confirmed in a larger sample.

INTRODUCTION
Hormone therapy consisting of conjugated equine
estrogens (CEE) along with medroxyprogesterone
acetate initiated in the late postmenopause stage
(≥ 65 years) increased the risk of dementia in the
Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS)
[1]. However, there is controversy on whether estro-
gen with or without progesterone can preserve
neurological function and decrease the risk of demen-
tia when administered early in menopause, i.e.,
during a “window of opportunity” phase [2–8].
Although determining the effects of hormone treat-
ment shortly after menopause on the risk of dementia
would require decades of follow-up, non-invasive
imaging markers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patho-
physiology can potentially assess the efficacy of
preventive interventions in the short term.
The Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study
(KEEPS) was a multi-center, randomized, placebo-
controlled, double-blinded trial of hormone treatment
in recently menopausal women who were in good car-
diovascular health. KEEPS tested the hypothesis that
hormone therapies administered soon after the onset
of menopause would slow progression of atheroscle-
rosis; [9] however, no effect was observed on several
imaging markers of progression of atherosclerosis
during the four year trial [10], or cognitive function
[11]. Although estrogens, in particular, are thought to
modify the risk of AD, estrogen effects on amyloid-�
(A�) pathology have not been investigated in a hor-
mone treatment trial. Examining data obtained at one
KEEPS enrollment site, we report the effects of two
forms of hormone therapy, oral CEE and transdermal
17� estradiol therapy on A� deposition measured by
Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) PET.
METHODS
Participants
KEEPS (NCT00154180) was a multicenter, ran-
domized, double blinded, placebo-controlled clinical
trial in recently menopausal women (n = 727) that
was conducted between 2006 and 2011. Partici-
pants enrolled in KEEPS were between 42 to 59
years of age, within 5 to 36 months past their last
menses, and were in good cardiovascular health and
did not have a history of hysterectomy or oophorec-
tomy [9]. Estrogens were administered through two
different routes: Oral or transdermal. Participants
were randomized to either: 1) oral conjugated equine
estrogen (CEE; Premarin, 0.45 mg/day); 2) transder-
mal 17�-estradiol (skin patch, Climara, 50 �g/day);
or 3) placebo pills and patch. Progesterone was
given orally (Prometrium; micronized progesterone,
200 mg/day) for the first 12 days each month to both
active treatment groups. Participants were treated for
four years.
Neuroimaging for the current study was con-
ducted from December 2012 through July 2014 and
included the subsample of women who were enrolled
in KEEPS at the Mayo Clinic, to investigate the
effects of the KEEPS hormone treatments on A�
deposition three years after the end of the trial. This
study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional
Review Board and all subjects or appropriate sur-
rogates provided informed consent for participation
Exclusion criteria for the imaging studies were con-
traindications for safety and neurologic disorders
such as brain tumors, multiple sclerosis, neurodevel-
opmental abnormalities, or treatments (e.g., systemic
chemotherapy) that would affect the brain structure.
Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping was performed
after randomization and clinical examinations were
performed at the Mayo Clinic Specialized Center of
Research on Sex Differences within three months of
the imaging studies. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board at Mayo Clinic and all
participants gave informed consent.
Neuropsychological assessment and cognitive
function
A confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess
the underlying structure of baseline cognitive data
from the KEEPS cognitive and affective study
(n = 662), and to derive summary scores [12]. Using
standard criteria for model fit, the cognitive variables
were summarized with a general domain representing
global cognitive function at baseline.
A battery of neuropsychological tests three years
after the end of the hormone therapy phase were
administered within three weeks of the neuroimag-
ing examinations in the Research Psychometrics
Resource Laboratory at Mayo Clinic’s Center for
Translational Science Activities (CTSA) under the
direction of a neuropsychologist (JP). Cognitive
performance was investigated in four domains: 1)
Learning & Memory from the California Verbal
Learning Test (CVLT), New York University (NYU)
Paragraphs, and Benton Visual Retention Test; 2)
Auditory Attention & Working Memory from Wech-
sler Memory Scale-III Letter-Number Sequencing

and Digit Span subtests; 3) Visual Attention & Per-
ceptual Speed from Trail Making Test part A, Color
and Word trials of the Stroop test, and Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale-III Digit Symbol Coding subtest;
4) Speeded Language & Flexibility from phonemic
(F, A, S) and category (animals, fruits, vegetables)
verbal fluency, Trail Making Test part B, and Color-
Word Interference trial of the Stroop.
MRI and PET imaging
MRI studies were performed on a single 1.5T
system, with an 8-channel phased-array coil (GE
Healthcare). A 3D high resolution MPRAGE acqui-
sition with TR/TE/TI = 7/3/900 ms; flip angle 8
degrees; in plane resolution of 1.0 mm and a slice
thickness of 1.2 mm was performed for anatomical
segmentation and labeling of PiB PET scans.
PET images were acquired using a PET/CT scan-
ner (DRX; GE Healthcare) operating in 3D mode.
The participants were injected with 292–729 MBq
[11C]PIB. A CT image was obtained for attenuation
correction. After a 40-min uptake period, a 20-min
PiB scan was obtained. The PiB- PET acquisition
consisted of four 5-min dynamic frames, acquired
from 40 to 60 min after injection. Standard correc-
tions were applied. The pixel size for PET images
was 1.0 mm and the slice thickness was 3.3 mm.
Analysis of PiB PET
PiB PET quantitative image analysis was per-
formed using the fully automated image processing
pipeline which has been described in detail elsewhere
[13]. Briefly, the method includes gray matter (GM)
sharpening of PET images using MRI and partial
volume correction of cerebrospinal fluid and tissue
compartments using Statistical Parametric Mapping
unified segmentation algorithm [14]. PiB PET cor-
tical ratio images were calculated by dividing each
PiB PET GM voxel value by the median value in
the cerebellar GM region in patient’s MRI space.
PiB retention was calculated by the PiB Standard
unit value ratio (SUVR), with the median values of
the PiB PET GM ratio from the bilateral parietal,
posterior cingulate, precuneus, temporal, prefrontal,
orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate GM regions in the
in-house modified anatomical labeling atlas.
Statistical analysis
Characteristics of participants were compared
across the treatment and the placebo groups using
Kruskal-Wallis tests or Fisher exact tests, as appro-
priate. We also compared the characteristics of
the participants and non-participants. Cognitive test
scores were compared across the treatment and
the placebo groups using ANOVA and Tukey’s
honest significant differences test for the post-hoc
comparisons with adjustments. Age was tested for
association with PiB SUVR using Spearman correla-
tions. We performed the comparisons of PiB SUVR
values across treatment and placebo groups, adjusting
for age, using proportional odds logistic regressions
[15]. This semiparametric model mitigates the effect
of outliers while allowing for parametric effects
of age and treatment, and simultaneously estimates
the log (odds) of higher versus lower value of PiB
SUVR, at all possible threshold values. Thus, we did
not classify the participants into A�-positive and
A�-negative categories based on PiB SUVR.
RESULTS
All women enrolled in KEEPS at the Mayo Clinic
in Rochester, Minnesota (n = 118) were considered
for participation in the current study. Six partici-
pants were excluded due to neurological disorders
or MRI contraindications, forty women declined to
participate in both MRI and/or PET studies, and four
participants were lost to follow-up. Of the 112 eli-
gible KEEPS participants, 68 women (61%) with
median age of 60 (range, 52–65) participated in both
the MRI and PET studies and were included in the
analysis (Fig. 1). Participants included in the analysis
did not differ from those who did not participate in
the neuroimaging study on age (p = 0.09), education
(p = 0.42), smoking status (p = 0.48), time past from
menopause to randomization (p = 0.55), or APOE sta-
tus (p = 0.47).
The time elapsed between last menses and ran-
domization was on average ten months longer in
the oral CEE (p = 0.05) and five months longer in
the transdermal 17�-estradiol group compared to
placebo (p = 0.04). The transdermal 17�-estradiol
group had a higher proportion of APOE �4 carri-
ers (50%) than the oral CEE (18%; p = 0.08) and the
placebo groups (18%; p = 0.03). All APOE �4 carri-
ers had the �4/�3 genotype. Three women declined
APOE genetic testing (Table 1). All participants were
cognitively normal on clinical examination and neu-
ropsychological testing. There were no correlations
between neuropsychometric test scores and the PiB
SUVR values in the entire group as well as in the

group).
oral CEE, transdermal 17�-estradiol and placebo
groups separately (p > 0.09). However, after adjust-
ing for age, education, APOE �4 status, and time from
menopause to randomization, CVLT Total Score was
lower in the oral CEE group compared to placebo
on ANOVA and post hoc Tukey’s Honest Significant
differences test (p = 0.03) (Table 2).
Because of a difference in the proportion of APOE
�4 carriers among treatment groups, and the poten-
tial impact of this variable on outcome, a stratified
analysis in APOE �4 carriers and non-carriers was
conducted. There was a significant association of
PiB SUVR with age in the whole group (r = 0.37;
p = 0.002), in APOE �4 carriers (r = 0.48; p = 0.046),
and in APOE �4 non-carriers (r = 0.43; p = 0.003).
Therefore, all analyses were adjusted by age (Fig. 2).
The distribution of PiB SUVR varied by treat-
ment group and by APOE �4 carrier status (Fig. 3).
Participants who were treated with 17�-estradiol
were were more likely to have lower PiB SUVR
compared to placebo after adjusting for age [odds
ratio (95%CI) = 0.31 (0.11–0.83)]. By use of the
proportional odds model, this odds ratio applies
to any possible cut-point for PiB SUVR. In
the APOE �4 carriers (n = 18), transdermal 17�-
estradiol treated participants were more likely to
have lower PiB SUVR compared to placebo [odds
ratio (95%CI) = 0.04 (0.004–0.44)], and compared
to the oral CEE treated participants [odds ratio
(95%CI) = 0.01 (0.0006–0.23)] after adjusting for
age. Treatment with either oral CEE or transdermal
17�-estradiol was not associated with PiB SUVR in
APOE �4 non-carriers (n = 47) (Fig. 4).
DISCUSSION
This study of recently menopausal women who
participated in a randomized controlled hormone
therapy trial showed that A� deposition measured
by PiB retention on PET was lower in women who
received transdermal 17�-estradiol for four years
compared to placebo. In contrast, oral CEE was
not associated with a lower level of PiB retention.
Although the oral CEE group performed worse on
verbal learning and memory compared to placebo,
this finding should be interpreted with caution
because of the small sample size and because no
correlation was found between PiB retention and cog-
nitive test scores. Stratified analysis by APOE �4
genotype showed that the lower PiB retention in the
transdermal 17�-estradiol group was present only in
the APOE �4 carriers. Hormone therapy was not asso-
ciated with PiB retention in APOE �4 non-carriers.
Aprecipitousdeclineinendogenousestrogenswith
menopause is thought to be a major driver of AD risk
in women. Hence, hormone therapy with estrogens

offers the possibility for preventing or delaying the
onset of AD in aging women [6, 8, 16, 17]. Observa-
tional studies suggest that estrogen treatment, when
administeredtorecentlymenopausalwomen,protects
from age-associated cognitive decline and demen-
tia [5, 17–25]. KEEPS was a randomized, placebo-
controlled hormone therapy trial designed to test
for intervention during the period of rapid estrogen

depletion in recently menopausal women. Thus,
KEEPS is ideally positioned to investigate the effects
of hormone therapy on prevention of AD-related
pathology during this “window of opportunity”.
PiB retention on PET imaging is a quantitative
measure of A� deposition [26]. High A� deposi-
tion measured on PET imaging or via cerebrospinal
fluid is considered to be the earliest biomarker change
observed during the preclinical stages of AD [27,
28]. Thus, PiB retention on PET is an appropriate
biomarker to investigate whether hormone therapy
influences A� deposition specifically during the early
menopausal years when the effect of A� deposi-
tion on cognitive function is not yet manifested. We
observed no differences in cognitive function among
the 17�-estradiol and placebo groups. However, a
randomized controlled trial of oral 17�-estradiol in
older women (age: 61–87) found less decline in
short-delayed verbal recall compared to placebo [29].
Hence, the effects of lower levels of A� deposition
in the transdermal 17�-estradiol group on cognitive
function may be apparent later in life.
Carriers of the APOE �4 allele are at an increased
risk of AD dementia; moreover the risk may be higher
in women than in men [30, 31]. APOE �4 carriers
have increased A� deposition at an earlier age than
APOE �4 non-carriers, and this difference is more
pronounced in women than in men [32, 33]. Thus,
women who are APOE �4 carriers are at a higher risk
for AD-related pathology and may benefit most from
preventive interventions at an early age. In the cur-
rentstudy,wefoundthatpostmenopausaltransdermal
17�-estradiol is associated with lower levels of A�
deposition compared to placebo particularly among
women who are APOE �4 carriers. We interpret this
finding in two possible ways.
The first possible interpretation is that APOE sta-
tus modifies the effect of transdermal 17�-estradiol
on A� deposition as a pharmacogenetic effect. This
interpretation is consistent with observations where
APOE also modulates the effect of transdermal 17�-
estradiol therapy on A� deposition in live mice, [34]
and in cultured adult mouse cortical neurons [35].
APOE �4 status appears to modify the effects of hor-
mone therapy on cognitive function and dementia
also in humans; however, the findings are conflicting
[36–38]. In one observational study, APOE �4 posi-
tive women opting to use hormone therapy had lower
risk of dementia, however, the forms of hormone
therapy were not specified [36]. On the contrary,
APOE �4 positive women had more cognitive decline
than APOE �4 negative women if they used hor-
mone therapy (primarily with oral CEE) in two other
observational studies [37, 38]. Similarly, we did not
find an association of oral CEE therapy with A�
deposition compared to placebo. In fact, APOE �4
carriers treated with oral CEE showed higher levels
of A� deposition than APOE �4 carriers treated with
transdermal 17�-estradiol. However because of the
low number of APOE �4 carriers in the CEE group,
this finding needs to be interpreted with caution. In
WHIMS, oral CEE therapy along with medroxypro-
gesteroneacetate,initiatedinolderwomen(age ≥ 65)
increased the risk of dementia and brain atrophy,
which persisted into older ages [1, 2, 39, 40]; how-
ever, the APOE �4 status of women in WHIMS was
not reported. Because CEE increases serum levels of
estrone and of sulfonated conjugates more than trans-
dermal 17�-estradiol, it is possible that the various
circulating estrogens would have different efficacy in
binding and activation of estrogen receptor mediated
eventssuchasthedepositionofA�[41].Furtherwork
is needed to understand how higher doses of oral CEE
(e.g., 0.625 mg/day as used in the Women’s Health
Initiative), may increase the circulating levels of 17�-
estradiol to those comparable to the transdermal 17�-
estradiol treatment group.
A second possible interpretation of the finding is
that the APOE �4 non-carriers included in our study
were too young to show hormone therapy effects
on A� deposition. Participants recruited to the PET
studythreeyearsafterKEEPSwereatamedianageof
60 with a range of 52 to 65. In the population-based
Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, the estimated age at
which 10% of the population had high levels of A�
deposition was 57 years for APOE �4 carriers and 64
years for APOE �4 non-carriers [42]. Thus, it may be
too early to detect transdermal 17�-estradiol effects
on A� deposition in APOE �4 non-carriers in the cur-
rent study. Further follow-up of the cohort is planned
to determine whether transdermal 17�-estradiol ther-
apy in recently menopausal women is associated with
A� deposition in older age.
This study was conducted at a single KEEPS site;
therefore, the sample size is limited. Our findings
need to be confirmed in a larger sample perhaps
by including all KEEPS sites. The participation
rate (with the exclusions) for this multimodality
imaging study is comparable to the imaging par-
ticipation rate observed in other hormone therapy
trials such as the WHIMS-MRI study [40]. A higher
proportion of APOE �4 carriers in the transder-
mal 17�-estradiol group is not surprising given the
relatively small number of women included this
 554
K. Kantarci et al. / Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy and Aβ Deposition
pilot study. Randomization does not guarantee a
balanced allocation across treatment groups when
the numbers are small. Lower A� deposition in
the transdermal 17�-estradiol group compared to
placebo cannot be explained by the higher pro-
portion of APOE �4 carriers in the transdermal
17�-estradiol group than the placebo. In fact, the
opposite would be expected, because A� deposition
should be highest in a group with a higher propor-
tion of APOE �4 carriers. Although the study cohort
was randomized to hormone therapies and placebo 7
years ago, cardiovascular risk factors and biomarkers
remained comparable in the oral CEE, transdermal
17�-estradiol and placebo groups at 84 months
(7 years) post-randomization. KEEPS was designed
to include women who were in good cardiovascular
and neurological health, therefore generalization of
our findings to a broader population may be limited.
Yet, in a homogenously healthy cohort of women,
the potential effects of hormone therapy on A� depo-
sition are not confounded by vascular disease and
perhaps define a population who might benefit from
the use of transdermal 17�-estradiol.
The consequences of A� deposition during early
menopausal years are not fully understood, and effec-
tiveness of early menopausal hormone therapy in
preventing AD-related pathology in the long-term
remains unclear. However, reducing A� deposition
through A�-modifying therapies is a widely accepted
strategy for preventing AD, and clinical trials are
underway in cognitively normal individuals with high
PiB retention, [43] and in APOE �4 carriers [44].
The association of transdermal 17�-estradiol ther-
apy in recently menopausal women with lower A�
deposition has the potential to change the concepts
for preventive interventions that drive the field, and
may have a significant impact on women making the
decision to use hormone therapy in the early post-
menopausal years.
