ABSTRACT
Background The relationship between meniscal tears
and other joint pathologies with patient-reported
symptoms is not clear. We investigated associations
between structural knee pathologies identified at surgery
with preoperative knee pain and function in patients
undergoing arthroscopic meniscal surgery.
Methods This study included 443 patients from the
Knee Arthroscopy Cohort Southern Denmark (KACS), a
prospective cohort following patients 18 years or older
undergoing arthroscopic meniscal surgery at 4 hospitals
between 1 February 2013 and 31 January 2014.
Patient-reported outcomes, including the Knee Injury and
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), were obtained by
online questionnaires prior to surgery. Knee pathology
was assessed by the operating surgeons using a
modified version of the International Society of
Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery and Orthopaedic Sports
Medicine (ISAKOS) classification of meniscal tears
questionnaire, supplemented with information extracted
from surgery reports. Following hypothesis-driven
preselection of candidate variables, backward elimination
regressions were performed to investigate associations
between patient-reported outcomes and structural knee
pathologies.
Results Regression models only explained a small
proportion of the variability in self-reported pain and
function (adjusted R2=0.10−0.12) and this association
was mainly driven by age, gender and body mass index.
Conclusions Specific meniscal pathology and other
structural joint pathologies found at meniscal surgery
were not associated with preoperative self-reported pain
and function in patients with meniscal tears questioning
inferences made about a direct relationship between
these. Our findings question the role of arthroscopic
surgery to address structural pathology as a means to
improve patient-reported outcomes in patients having
surgery for a meniscal tear.
INTRODUCTION
Arthroscopic meniscal surgery is one of the most
commonly
performed
orthopaedic
procedures.1
Diagnosis of meniscal tears involves clinical history
and physical examination and is often confirmed by
MRI, which has high accuracy in diagnosing menis-
cal tears.2–4 MRI-based studies have reported that
meniscal tears are common in the contralateral
asymptomatic knee in patients sustaining a knee
trauma5 and in middle-aged and older individuals
without symptoms and/or signs of radiographic
knee osteoarthritis.6–8 In combination with recent
evidence challenging the effect of knee arthroscopy
for meniscal tears,9 the theoretical framework for
meniscal surgery has been questioned: that the
meniscus tear is responsible for the patient per-
ceived pain and other symptoms, and that dealing
with the meniscal tear by surgery will lead to reso-
lution of symptoms.10
Meniscal tears often present in combination with
other knee pathology at arthroscopy. Thus, it is
plausible that knee symptoms may be caused by
factors other than meniscal tears per se,11 or some
types of meniscal tears could be symptomatic while
others are not. Arthroscopy can provide informa-
tion about meniscal tear pattern and coexisting
pathologies potentially related to knee symptoms,
such as cartilage damage, synovial changes and
inflammation.12
The aim of this study was to investigate the asso-
ciation between structural knee pathologies identi-
fied at surgery with preoperative pain and function
in patients with a verified meniscal tear at surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Cross-sectional study investigating the association
between preoperative patient-reported knee pain
and function and pathological findings at knee
arthroscopy.
Participants
Participants from the Knee Arthroscopy Cohort
Southern Denmark (KACS)13 with baseline assess-
ment of patient-reported outcomes and a verified
meniscal tear at surgery. KACS is a prospective
cohort study following patients recruited between 1
February 2013 and 31 January 2014 undergoing
knee arthroscopy for a meniscal tear at four differ-
ent public hospitals in Denmark. Patients were
informed about the KACS cohort study by a study
nurse and asked to sign the consent form after
being referred to surgery for a meniscal tear by an
orthopaedic surgeon. For logistical reasons, partici-
pants at one study site were presented with infor-
mation
about
the
study
prior
to
seeing
the
orthopaedic surgeon but signed the consent form
after being referred to surgery.
Inclusion
criteria
were:
≥18 years
of
age,
referred to knee arthroscopy on suspicion of a
meniscus tear based on clinical examination by an
orthopaedic surgeon and MRI (if considered neces-
sary), able to read and speak Danish and having an
email address.
Exclusion criteria were: no meniscal tear found
at surgery, previous or planned ACL or posterior

 cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery in either knee, fracture
(s) to the lower extremities within the past 6 months prior to
recruitment or not able to reply to the questionnaire because of
mental impairment. Patients with missing data on any structural
pathology were excluded from this study.
Informed consent to the use of personal data was obtained
from all included patients, even though the Regional Scientific
Ethics Committee of Southern Denmark waived the need for
ethical approval after reviewing the outline of KACS.13
Patient-reported outcomes
Patient-reported outcomes were collected using online question-
naires prior to surgery (median 7 days, IQR 3–11 days). The
patient-reported outcomes (ie, dependent variables) of interest
for this analysis were: pain, function in sport and recreation
(Sport/Rec) and function in daily living (ADL) assessed using the
Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).14 These
domains were selected, based on their inclusion as primary out-
comes to study the effectiveness of meniscal surgery in previous
studies.9 15 KOOS is a knee-specific questionnaire used to assess
patient-reported outcomes of knee injury consisting of five sub-
scales in total: pain, symptoms, ADL, Sport/Rec and quality of
life. Each domain ranges from 0 to 100 points with 0 being
extremely symptomatic and 100 being asymptomatic. The inclu-
sion of subscales of physical function relating to daily life and
sport and recreation enhances KOOS’s validity for patients
within a wide age range and range of current and expected
physical activity levels,16 such as patients undergoing meniscus
surgery since these range from young to old. KOOS is valid for
patients undergoing arthroscopic meniscal surgery,14 16–18 and
has been used to assess self-reported outcomes in this group of
patients.19 20
Structural pathology at arthroscopy
Objective findings of knee pathologies pertaining to the menis-
cus and cartilage were recorded by the operating surgeon at
arthroscopy using a modified version of the International
Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery and Orthopaedic Sports
Medicine (ISAKOS) classification of meniscal tears question-
naire21 (ie, including scoring of cartilage using the International
Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grading system).22 This infor-
mation was supplemented with additional pathological findings
extracted from the patients’ surgery reports. Information regis-
tered by surgeons on the modified ISAKOS questionnaire was
transferred from paper format to electronic format using auto-
mated forms processing. This method is a valid alternative to
double entry of data.23
The following variables were included in the analysis: tear
location (ie, medial and/or lateral tear), tear depth, circumferen-
tial location of tear, radial location of tear, tear pattern, menis-
cus tissue quality, length of tear, cartilage grade, presence of
plica and knee joint laxity assessed by the surgeon at surgery.
ACL rupture (only on non-reconstructed patients) and grade of
inflammation/synovitis were retrieved from surgery reports.
Synovitis was generally well described, especially when present,
therefore missing descriptions of synovitis were considered as
no synovitis present.
Variable grouping
To improve interpretability of statistical models, we grouped the
selected independent variables into blocks of variables of similar
construct. For example, all variables concerning structural
change of the meniscus were grouped together in a single block.
Thus, all selected variables were entered into one of five blocks:
previous surgery, meniscal pathology, cartilage pathology, other
findings at arthroscopy and patients characteristics (ie, age, sex
and body mass index (BMI) as they are considered traditional
confounders; see online supplementary appendix table S1).
Statistical analysis
No power calculation was conducted due to the exploratory
nature of the study. Before exclusion of patients with missing
data, we conducted a drop out analysis to test for differences
between patients with and without missing data. Continuous
data were tested using student’s unpaired t-test and categorical
data using either the χ2 or Fischer’s exact test.
Prior to analysis, collinearity was investigated by calculating
variance inflation factors (VIFs) for all independent variables.
The level of collinearity was not considered problematic if mean
VIF was below 4 and individual VIFs were <10.24 For each
outcome (ie, pain, Sport/Rec and ADL), we performed a linear
backward elimination regression analysis on prespecified blocks
of variables to investigate which pathological factors that were
related
to
the
three
different
outcomes,
respectively.
Additionally, we assessed the magnitude and direction of asso-
ciations between outcome measures and variables included in
the models. At first, all candidate blocks were included in the
model. At each step, the least significant block of variables was
removed by backward elimination using a cut-off of p≤0.10.
R2 and adjusted R2 were examined to describe how well the
models explained the overall variance. In addition, hierarchical
regressions were performed for blocks reaching statistical signifi-
cance (ie, p≤0.10). Significant blocks were entered in order
from lowest to highest p value to assess individual R2 for each
block. This method was also used to assess R2 values for indi-
vidual variables within each significant block. Finally, distribu-
tion of residuals and level of heteroskedasticity were checked
for each backward elimination regression model to determine
how well a linear regression described the data. Distribution of

RESULTS
Participant characteristics
In total, 1012 patients were invited to participate in the study.
Three hundred and thirty-five of these were excluded prior to
surgery, and 186 out of the 677 patients who underwent arthro-
scopic surgery were excluded because no meniscal tear was
found (ie, corresponding to 18%, 12%, 30% and 16% of
patients at the four recruitment sites, respectively; figure 1). The
majority (71%) of the remaining 491 patients had a preopera-
tive MRI to confirm the presence of a meniscal tear. The 491
arthroscopic surgeries were performed by 42 different surgeons,
with 15 surgeons being responsible for 86% of the surgeries.
Subsequent to surgery, 48 patients with missing values on the
modified ISAKOS questionnaire were excluded after no differ-
ence was found between patients with and without missing data
(see online supplementary appendix table S2). After exclusions,
a total of 443 patients were included for analysis (figure 1).
The majority of patients were male and the study sample on
average middle-aged and slightly overweight. Most patients had
medial meniscal tears and many patients had concomitant cartil-
age damage (table 1).
Regression analyses
In general, no association between structural pathology and self-
reported outcomes was found for pain or ADL function (tables 2
and 3). For Sport/Rec function, <5% of the variability in this
score could be attributed to the ‘other findings at arthroscopy’,
which was driven by increasing levels of synovitis being

 associated with poorer Sport/Rec function (table 4). The ‘other
findings at arthroscopy’ block was the only significant structural
pathology block across models.
Overall, the adjusted R2 values indicated that the variables in
the regression models could explain only 10%, 11% and 12%
of the variability in Pain, Sport/Rec and ADL, respectively, and
this was mainly explained by the patient characteristics age,
gender and BMI (tables 2–4).
Collinearity and model assumptions
No collinearity was detected between independent variables
included in the regression analyses. Visual inspection of relevant
plots and appropriate statistical tests showed normal distribution
of residuals and no signs of heteroskedasticity for the pain and
ADL model, confirming that a linear regression described the
models well. The Sport/Rec model showed obvious flooring
effect, slight heteroskedasticity and a less perfect distribution of
residuals than the other models, however the linear regression
model still described the data sufficiently.
DISCUSSION
W
e found no relevant association between structural knee path-
ology and self-reported pain and function prior to arthroscopic
meniscal surgery in this study. Synovitis was the only variable to
explain a very small part of the variability in the self-reported
Sport/Rec function of the KOOS questionnaire. In all models,
the patient characteristics of age, female gender and greater
BMI were consistently but weekly associated with poorer
self-reported outcomes.
MRI-based studies have reported that the presence of meniscal
tears is common in patient knees in the absence of patient-
reported symptoms,5–8 challenging the classical tenet of menis-
cal injuries being a main cause of knee symptoms in patients
with meniscal pathology. The menisci are mainly innervated in
the peripheral, vascular zone, represented by the outer one-third
of the menisci and the anterior and posterior horns.25 No nerve
fibres are seen in the avascular intermediate or inner third of
the menisci.25 Sensation of pain in the non-anaesthetised human
knee has been reported to be markedly higher from the outer
than the inner rim of the menisci, investigated by instrumented
arthroscopic palpation.26 Thus, it is plausible that factors such
as size, location and type of meniscal tear could be important
for patient perceived pain. Hypothetically, a small radial tear in
the avascular zone should not cause pain, whereas a tear in the
outer third part presumably would. However, in the present
study we found no association between any of the investigated
structural pathologies related to the meniscal tear and self-
reported pain.
Synovitis has been reported to be associated with preoperative
pain and dysfunction in patients with traumatic meniscal injury
undergoing partial meniscectomy.12 The results of the present
study are in line with this, as increasing levels of synovitis were
somewhat associated with poorer function during strenuous
tasks (ie, Sport/Rec function). However, this result should be
interpreted with caution as the association was not consistent
across models and only explained about 3% of the variability in
KOOS Sport/Rec function score.
Implications of findings
Inferences about a clear relationship between structural knee
pathology and patient perceived symptoms as part of a rationale
for the indication for arthroscopic meniscus surgery are not sup-
ported by results of the present study. Further, the results of our
study do not support a construct of specific subgroups of
patients, based on meniscal and other structural pathology,
which may have particular benefit of surgery compared with
others. The lack of association between structural pathology on
the one hand, and pain and physical function on the other
hand, may partially explain the reported lack of efficacy of
arthroscopic surgery for knee pain in middle-aged and older
adults.9
Limitations
The analysis was based on stepwise regression procedures,
which are data driven and known to produce selection bias and
optimism as a result of overfitting.27 28 However, models with
small sample sizes are most prone to overfitting,28 and selected
variables with very small p values (for instance p<0.001) are
much less prone to selection bias and overfitting than variables
with p values near the chosen significance level.27 Yet, no
internal validation procedure was performed in this study, and
the extent of overfitting due to the use of predictor selection
strategies is therefore unaccounted for.28 Given the general lack

 of relationship between structural pathology and self-reported
outcomes in this study, we do not consider overfitting of models
a problem. To accommodate for possible variable selection bias,
we narrowed the list of candidate variables prior to backward
elimination regressions based on literature and likely hypoth-
eses, making the models hypothesis driven. Such preanalysis
selection is considered a good alternative to plain data-driven
variable selection.28 To avoid biased selection of variables prior
to analysis, no statistical tests were conducted on the data in
advance of the selection procedure.
In the present study, we used validated methods21 22 to sys-
tematically collect information about knee joint pathology at
arthroscopy
supplemented
with
information
from
surgery
reports.
Even
though
such
methods
have
shown
moderate-to-good reliability, some misclassification of joint
pathology may have occurred, which potentially could attenuate
an association with self-reported pain and function. However,
we consider it unlikely that such misclassification may have
caused the complete lack of association observed in the present
study.
In the present study, 186 of 677 patients who underwent
surgery on suspicion of a meniscal tear did not have a meniscal
tear at arthroscopy leading them to being excluded from our
present analysis. This may partly be explained by the absence of
MRI to verify the presence of a meniscal tear in all patients.
However, we believe the results are generalisable to Danish
patients undergoing meniscal surgery as the average age of
patients in the present study was 49.7 years and 44% were
female. This is similar to nationwide data from the Danish
National
Patient
Registry
showing
that
in
2011
patients
undergoing meniscal surgery on average were 47 years old and
41% were female.29
CONCLUSION
Specific meniscal pathology and other structural joint patholo-
gies found at arthroscopic meniscal surgery were not associated
with preoperative self-reported pain and function in patients
with meniscal tears, suggesting that inferences about a direct
relationship between these are questionable. Increasing age,
female gender and greater BMI were consistently associated
with poorer self-reported outcomes, although the variability
explained was modest. Our findings question the role of arthro-
scopic surgery to address structural pathology as a means to
improve patient-reported outcomes in patients having surgery
for a meniscal tear.
What are the findings?
▸ Meniscal pathology features such as tear type, tear size and
tear location identified at arthroscopy were not associated
with preoperative self-reported knee pain and function in
patients undergoing arthroscopic meniscal surgery.
▸ Other structural knee joint pathologies found at surgery,
such as cartilage damage, were not associated with
preoperative self-reported knee pain and function.
▸ Increasing age, female gender and greater body mass index
were modestly associated with poorer self-reported
outcomes.

 How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
▸ These findings question inferences made about relationships
between structural knee pathology and patient perceived
symptoms.
▸ Our findings question the role of arthroscopy to address
structural pathology as a means to improve patient-reported
outcomes and the construct of specific subgroups of
patients, based on meniscal and other structural pathology,
who may benefit from meniscal surgery.
