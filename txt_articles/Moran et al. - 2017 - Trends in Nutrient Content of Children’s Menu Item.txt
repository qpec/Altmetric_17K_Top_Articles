Abstract
Introduction—Restaurant food is widely consumed by children and is associated with poor diet 
quality. Although many restaurants have made voluntary commitments to improve the nutritional 
quality of children's menus, it is unclear whether this has led to meaningful changes.
Methods—Nutrients in children's menu items (n=4,016) from 45 chain restaurants were 
extracted from the nutrition information database MenuStat. Bootstrapped mixed linear models 
estimated changes in mean calories, saturated fat, and sodium in children's menu items between 
2012 and 2013, 2014, and 2015. Changes in nutrient content of these items over time were 
compared among restaurants participating in the Kids LiveWell initiative and non-participating 
restaurants. Types of available children's beverages were also examined. Data were analyzed in 
2016.
Results—There was a significant increase in mean beverage calories from 2012 to 2013 (6, 95% 
CI=0.8, 10.6) and from 2012 to 2014 (11, 95% CI=3.7, 18.3), but no change between 2012 and 
2015, and no differences in nutrient content of other items over time. Restaurants participating in 
Kids LiveWell reduced entrée calories between 2012 and 2013 (−24, 95% CI= −40.4, −7.2) and 
between 2012 and 2014 (−40, 95% CI= −68.1, −11.4) and increased side dish calories between 
2012 and 2015 (49, 95% CI=4.6, 92.7) versus non-participating restaurants. Sugar-sweetened 
beverages consistently constituted 80% of children's beverages, with soda declining and flavored 
milks increasing between 2012 and 2015.

 Conclusions—Results suggest little progress toward improving nutrition in children's menu 
items. Efforts are needed to engage restaurants in offering healthful children's meals.
Introduction
From 1977 to 2006, energy from restaurant sources increased from 3% to 18% of energy 
intake among children aged 2–18 years.1 In 2011–2012, more than one third of children and 
adolescents consumed fast food each day.2 Among children, greater consumption of 
restaurant food is associated with higher intake of calories from added sugar and solid fats, 
as well as poorer diet quality.3,4 National data indicate that 35% of added sugars and solid 
fats consumed by children aged >2 years come from fast-food restaurants. Sugar-sweetened 
beverages, dairy-based desserts, French fries, and pizza contribute the bulk of these sugars 
and solid fats.3 Among children aged 2–11 years, eating at fast-food and full-service 
restaurants is associated with higher daily energy, saturated fat, sugar, regular soda, and 
sugar-sweetened beverage intake.4
Although there are currently no mandatory nutrition requirements for children's meals in 
chain restaurants, the restaurant industry has made voluntary commitments to improve the 
dietary quality of children's menus. In July 2011, the National Restaurant Association 
launched a voluntary program called Kids LiveWell, which aimed to increase the number of 
nutritious menu items available to children. By 2015, more than 150 restaurant chains with 
42,000 locations were participating.5 Additionally, individual restaurant chains have made 
voluntary commitments to improving kids' meals outside of the scope of Kids LiveWell. 
Between 2011 and 2013, McDonald's replaced French fries and soda in Happy Meals with 
fruit and low-fat milk.6 Between 2013 and 2015, large national chains, including Applebee's, 
Subway, Chipotle, Arby's, Panera Bread, Wendy's, and Burger King, announced they would 
remove soda as the default choice on children's menus.7,8
Although these voluntary steps to improve children's meals are promising, cross-sectional 
studies of children's menus in restaurants have found that few options meet guidelines for a 
healthful diet, such as those put forth by the National School Lunch Program9 or the Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans.10,11 A recent study of children's entrées and side dishes in 29 
chain restaurants found that in 2014, one third of main dishes at fast-food restaurants and 
half of main dishes at full-service restaurants exceeded levels of calories, fat, saturated fat, 
and sodium recommended by the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.12 The nutrient 
content of children's beverages and desserts—two of the four largest contributors to added 
sugars and solid fats in children's restaurant food—were not assessed. Further, no recent 
studies have assessed whether changes in nutritional quality of restaurant menu items have 
occurred since the start of programs like Kids LiveWell and other voluntary restaurant 
commitments.
To address gaps in the research, this study examined trends in nutrient content of 4,016 
beverages, entrées, side dishes, and desserts offered on children's menus in a sample of 45 of 
the nation's top 100 fast-food, fast-casual, and full-service restaurant chains between 2012 
and 2015 to assess whether the nutritional quality of children's restaurant meals has 
improved during a time when several voluntary restaurant initiatives were implemented. This

 study also assessed whether these changes differed between restaurants participating in the 
National Restaurant Association's Kids LiveWell Initiative and non-participating restaurants.
Methods
Data Sample
Data were obtained from MenuStat (menustat.org)—a census of nutrition data from websites 
of the nation's largest restaurant chains, identified by U.S. sales.13 Several published studies 
have used this database to examine trends in nutritional quality of menu items at restaurants 
over time.14–16 A description of MenuStat methods is published.17 The sample of restaurant 
chains used in this study is a balanced panel; all chains offering children's items in each year 
from 2012 to 2015 were included (n=45), with children's items designated as any item with 
“kid,” “child,” or “children” appearing in the menu item or its description. Characteristics of 
restaurants were extracted from restaurants websites.14 Restaurant chains were “national” if 
they were located in all U.S. census regions (n=26); otherwise, they were “regional” (n=19). 
Chains were “full service” if they offered table service (n=16; e.g., Applebee's); “fast 
casual” if they offered at least two of the following: non-disposable utensils, onsite food 
preparation, no table service, or commitment to higher-quality or fresh ingredients or 
sustainability (n=6; e.g., Chipotle); and, otherwise, were “fast food” (n=23; e.g., Burger 
King).
Children's menu items from these 45 chains were the sample included in this study. Calories 
(kcal), sodium (mg), and saturated fat (g), were available for most items from 2012 to 2015. 
Some items could not be included because of limited information. Fountain beverages or 
items listing a range of nutrient data for various combinations (e.g., tacos with a choice of 
toppings) were added as separate items if descriptions could be matched to nutrient data 
from MenuStat or archived restaurant websites; otherwise, these items were excluded 
(n=50). After exclusions, 152 (3.7%) items were missing information about calories (n=68), 
sodium (n=33), or saturated fat (n=119). Missing data were imputed based on the following 
order of preference:
1.
obtaining nutrient data directly from restaurants (n=46);
2.
searching product or restaurant website archives from the same month and year 
as MenuStat data collection (n=44);
3.
calculating nutrient data from an alternate portion size of the same product 
description (n=3);
4.
searching the U.S. Department of Agriculture Standard Reference Database18 
(n=12); or
5.
using the last observation carried forward (n=20).
Menu items missing data for any nutrient that could not be imputed (n=27) were excluded. 
Additionally, if an item was the sole item in its menu category within a restaurant (e.g., if a 
restaurant offered only one dessert), a variance could not be calculated and the item was 
excluded (n=43).

 The final data set included 4,016 beverages (n=1,886), entrées (n=1,378), side dishes 
(n=531), and desserts (n=221) (mutually exclusive categories created by MenuStat staff) 
available in 45 U.S. chain restaurants between 2012 and 2015 (Appendix Table 1, available 
online).
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed in 2016. A linear model with random intercepts to allow for correlation 
between items within restaurant chains was used to calculate:
1.
predicted mean calories in children's beverages and predicted mean calories, 
saturated fat, and sodium in children's entrées, side dishes, and desserts in 2012; 
and
2.
difference in mean calories in children's beverages and in mean calories, 
saturated fat, and sodium in children's entrées, side dishes, and desserts between 
2012 and 2013, 2014, and 2015.
The main independent variable was a year indicator (2012, 2013, 2014, or 2015), and 
covariates included indicators for whether a restaurant was national, fast food, fast casual, or 
full service. Even after log transformation, the distribution of beverage calories did not 
follow a standard normal distribution. Therefore, linear models were cluster bootstrapped 
with 500 repetitions to compute the SEs of the regression coefficient estimates from their 
empirical distributions. The cluster bootstrap provides unbiased estimates of SEs and does 
not impose a normal distribution on the data.19
In a second set of regressions, an indicator representing participation in Kids LiveWell was 
added to the previous model with interactions between the participation indicator and year 
dummies to assess the difference in changes in nutrient content of children's menu items 
over time among restaurants participating in Kids LiveWell and non-participating 
restaurants. Restaurants joining Kids LiveWell between its launch in July 2011 and January 
2015 were identified via the program's website.5
Trends in children's beverages were examined in more detail. Beverages were categorized 
into mutually exclusive groups: sugar-sweetened beverages (> 5 kcal/item, not described as 
“100% juice” or white milk), low-calorie beverages (≤5 kcal/item and not described as 
“unsweetened”), unsweetened beverages (≤5 kcal/item and described as “unsweetened”), 
100% juice (described as “100% juice”), and white milk (unflavored). Five was chosen as 
the threshold for “low-calorie” items based on recommendations from the Institute of 
Medicine Task Force on Nutrition Standards for Foods in Schools, which states that 
beverages sold in schools, other than 100% juice or milk, should contain <5 kcal/portion as 
packaged, meaning <5 kcal/item.20,21 Flavored milks were classified as sugar sweetened, 
based on healthy beverage standards that have been previously implemented in large public 
school districts.22,23 Most (87%) beverages in this category contained >100 kcal/item. 
Sugar-sweetened beverages were further divided into mutually exclusive categories: soda 
(carbonated beverages), fruit drinks (excludes “100% juice”), flavored milk, and other 
sweetened beverages (e.g., sport drinks, smoothies, sweetened teas). Tests for equality of 
proportions were used to determine whether proportions of beverages within each category

 differed between 2012 and 2013, 2014, and 2015. All analyses were conducted using Stata, 
version 13.
Results
Table 1 shows predicted mean calories, sodium, and saturated fat in children's beverages, 
entrées, side dishes, and desserts in 2012 and changes between 2012 and 2013, 2014, and 
2015. On average, beverages, entrées, side dishes, and desserts contained 139 kcal (SE=5.6), 
362 kcal (SE=8.8), 157 kcal (SE=10.4), and 360 kcal (SE=22.0), respectively. Entrées, side 
dishes, and desserts contained 794 mg (SE=21.0), 231 mg (SE=23.5), and 159 mg 
(SE=13.1) of sodium, and 6.1 g (SE=0.3), 1.7 g (SE=0.2), and 10.5 g (SE=0.9) of saturated 
fat, respectively. Between 2012 and 2014, there were small but significant increases in 
beverage calories, which increased by 6 kcal (95% CI=0.8, 10.6) from 2012 to 2013 and 11 
kcal (95% CI=3.7,18.3) from 2012 to 2014. There was no significant change in beverage 
calories between 2012 and 2015, and no changes in calories, sodium, or saturated fat in 
other food categories at any time point between 2012 and 2015.
Table 2 shows differences in calories, sodium, and saturated fat in children's menu items in 
2012 and changes between 2012 and subsequent years among restaurants participating in 
Kids LiveWell (n=15) and non-participating restaurants (n=30). Participating restaurants 
significantly reduced entrée calories between 2012 and 2013 (−24, 95% CI= −40.4, −7.2) 
and between 2012 and 2014 (−40, 95% CI= −68.1, −11.4) compared with non-participating 
restaurants, but differences did not persist from 2012 to 2015. Participating restaurants 
showed a trend toward increasing calories in children's side dishes across all time periods, 
although differences between participating and non-participating restaurants were only 
statistically significant between 2012 and 2015 (49, 95% CI=4.6, 92.7), and this was largely 
driven by a reduction in calories among non-participating restaurants. There were no 
differences between participating and non-participating restaurants with regard to calories in 
children's beverages or desserts, or with respect to sodium or saturated fat in any menu 
category.
Figure 1 shows the percentage of children's beverages in each category across time. Sugar-
sweetened beverages constituted the largest percentage of beverages in all years, making up 
79%–81% of beverages.
Within sugar-sweetened beverages, the percentage of options that were regular sodas 
declined from 2012 to 2015, dropping from 37% in 2012 to 29% in 2015 (p=0.032) (Figure 
2). The percentage of flavored milks nearly doubled in this time period, rising from 7% of 
sugar-sweetened beverages in 2012 to 12% in 2015 (p=0.014).
Discussion
There have been no substantial changes in calories, sodium, or saturated fat in children's 
menu items across multiple years, despite at least 45% of the restaurant sample publically 
committing to improving kids' meals between 2011 and 2015. There was a significant 
increase in mean beverage calories between 2012 and 2013 and 2014, but it was very small 
and there was no difference when comparing 2012 with 2015. Although restaurants

 participating in Kids LiveWell reduced calories in entrées between 2012 and 2013 and 2014 
compared with non-participating restaurants, these changes did not persist between 2012 and 
2015. Although the availability of soda on menus declined over time, this did not change 
availability of sugar-sweetened beverages, which consistently constituted nearly 80% of 
beverages. Flavored milks replaced sodas that were removed from children's menus.
Results from this study are similar to findings from Deierlein and colleagues,12 who 
examined nutritional differences in children's entrées and side dishes available for sale in 29 
of the top 50 chain restaurants in 2010 and 2014. Consistent with current findings, the 
authors reported no significant differences in calories, sodium, or saturated fat in children's 
main dishes or side dishes offered at fast-food restaurants from 2010 to 2014. The only 
significant finding was a decrease in calories (−46, p<0.05) and milligrams of sodium (−128, 
p<0.05) among side dishes offered in sit-down restaurants in 2014 compared with 2010. 
Differences between study findings may have resulted from the difference in restaurants 
included in the sample (29 of the top 50 versus 45 of the top 100 in this study), or difference 
in assessed time period (2010 and 2014 versus 2012-2015 in this study).
The findings from this study are in contrast to a 2013 report from Center for Science in the 
Public Interest, which concluded that restaurants were offering healthier meal combinations. 
That study compared all possible combinations of children's meals offered in 34 of the top 
50 restaurants in 2008 and 2012 and found that the percentage of meals meeting the 
Guidelines for Responsible Food Marketing to Children, which apply standards for calories, 
sodium, and saturated fat from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans24 and Institute of 
Medicine Dietary Reference Intakes,25 increased from 1% in 2008 to 3% in 2012.26 In 
addition, the proportion of meals meeting the calorie and sodium standards doubled between 
2008 and 2012, increasing from 7% to 14% and 15% to 34%, respectively. The difference in 
findings might be due to different time periods being analyzed (2008 compared with 2012 
versus 2012-2015 for the present study) or the way menu items were assessed (all possible 
combinations versus individual menu items in this study).
If a meal was ordered for a child in 2015 containing an average beverage, entrée, side dish, 
and dessert, it would contain 1,007 kcal, which is nearly twice the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's Recommended Dietary Allowance for children aged 4–8 years (<533 kcal/ 
meal).24 An average meal without a beverage would contain 1,187 mg sodium, which is 
more than 60% of the Institute of Medicine's 1,900 mg daily upper limit for children aged 4–
8 years.25 Meals at the 15 restaurants participating in Kids LiveWell were even higher in 
calories and sodium than non-participants in 2015, with the average combination containing 
1,034 calories and 1,219 mg sodium. More than 150 restaurant chains nationwide are 
participating in Kids LiveWell, but participants are only required to offer one children's meal 
and one other item that meet the program's nutrition standards.5 Strengthening the program's 
requirements for participation by asking restaurants to adopt the Kids LiveWell standards 
across a larger proportion of meals, or to adopt specific standards for healthy beverages that 
are consistent with public health recommendations, may lead to more meaningful 
improvements in children's menu items.

 The trend toward increasing beverage calories despite reductions in soda on children's 
menus is concerning. Restaurants have received substantial media attention for their efforts 
to remove soda from children's menus, with at least 15% of restaurants in the study sample 
announcing voluntary efforts since 2013.7,8 Though it is possible restaurants will make 
further changes in future years, as of early 2015, these commitments have not impacted 
availability of sugar-sweetened beverages on children's menus. When soda was removed 
from menus, other sweetened beverages replaced them. Restaurants should be encouraged to 
eliminate all sweetened beverages from children's menus, including flavored milks, fruit 
drinks, and sport drinks.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, only items available on children's menus were 
assessed, a method that does not account for how items were promoted or which items 
children are actually purchasing and consuming. Many children, especially adolescents, may 
be purchasing food from the regular menu. Although availability of unhealthy items on 
menu boards has been linked to the poor nutritional quality of purchased items, other factors, 
such as advertisements and combination meals, may impact children's food and beverage 
choices.27 A recent study assessing children's menu changes at a regional full-service 
restaurant found that when fruit and vegetable sides were bundled with children's meals by 
default, customer orders were more likely to include a healthy side dish.27 Similarly, 
McDonald's found that replacing soda with 100% apple juice and low-fat milk as the default 
children's beverage increased juice and milk selections by 9 percentage points.28 By not 
examining combination meals in this study, improvements to default children's items that 
could positively impact what children are purchasing and consuming may have been missed.
Additionally, this study's difference-in-difference analysis is subject to limitations. First, 
results from this analysis were stratified by whether an item was offered in a participating 
restaurant in each year. Thus, sample sizes for menu categories with fewer total items, 
particularly desserts, may have been too small to detect significant effects. Second, baseline 
nutrient data were collected in 2012, but Kids LiveWell was launched at the end of 2011. 
Although it is unlikely that restaurants would have made significant menu changes in the 
first few months of the program, any positive changes made between July 2011 and January 
2012 would not have been captured in this analysis, thus biasing results toward the null. 
Additionally, restaurants in this sample joined Kids LiveWell at different time points 
between 2011 and 2015, but were labeled as either “participants” or “non-participants” 
across all years. This was done to account for changes participating restaurants may have 
made in preparation for officially joining the initiative; however, this choice may have 
diluted the changes made by true program participants in each year, biasing effect estimates 
toward the null. Third, the difference-in-difference study design assumes parallel trends over 
time, and this assumption could not be tested because data from an earlier time period were 
not available. However, all restaurants were within the nation's 100 largest chains, and there 
are no clear differences between characteristics of participating and non-participating 
restaurants that would suggest differences with regard to changes in nutrient content of 
children's menu items over time. Finally, this analysis included only 15 restaurants 
participating in Kids LiveWell, which is a small subset of the more than 150 program

 participants. Because participating restaurants in this sample are primarily national chain 
restaurants, results cannot be generalized to smaller regional chains or independent 
restaurants. Future research is needed to examine the true program effect using a more 
representative sample of participating restaurants.
Conclusions
Between 2012 and 2015, there was little progress toward improving the healthfulness of 
children's menu items available in the nation's largest chain restaurants. Broad-reaching 
efforts to engage restaurants in offering and promoting healthful children's meals, through, 
for example, public–private partnerships that encourage reformulation or set more-rigorous 
voluntary nutrition standards for kids' meals, are needed to have a bigger impact.

 Figure 1. 
Types of children's beverages available in 45 U.S. chain restaurants in 2012-2015.
Note: Figure shows the percentage of beverages (n=1,886) offered on children's menus in 45 
U.S. national chain restaurants in 2012-2015 that were sugar-sweetened beverages, white 
milk, 100% juice, low-calorie beverages, or unsweetened beverages. Based on 
recommendations from the Institute of Medicine Task Force on Nutrition Standards for 
Foods in Schools, sugar-sweetened beverages were items containing >5 calories/item and 
not described as “100%juice” or white milk.18,19 Low-calorie beverages were items 
containing ≤5 calories/item and not described as “unsweetened.”
