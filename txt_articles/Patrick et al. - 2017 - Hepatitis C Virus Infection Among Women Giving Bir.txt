Hepatitis C Virus Infection Among Women Giving Birth — Tennessee and 
United States, 2009–2014

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects an estimated 3.5 million 
persons in the United States (1), making it the most common 
bloodborne infection in the country. Recent surveillance data 
showed increased rates of HCV infection among adolescents and 
adults who are predominantly white, live in nonurban areas, and 
have a history of injection drug use.* U.S. birth certificate data 
were used to analyze trends and geographic variations in rates of 
HCV infection among women giving birth during 2009–2014. 
Birth certificates from Tennessee were used to examine individual 
characteristics and outcomes associated with HCV infection, 
using a multivariable model to calculate adjusted odds of HCV-
related diagnosis in pregnancy among women with live births. 
During 2009–2014, HCV infection present at the time of deliv-
ery among pregnant women from states reporting HCV on the 
birth certificate increased 89%, from 1.8 to 3.4 per 1,000 live 
births. The highest infection rate in 2014 (22.6 per 1,000 live 
births) was in West Virginia; the rate in Tennessee was 10.1. In 
adjusted analyses of Tennessee births, the odds of HCV infection 
were approximately threefold higher among women residing in 
rural counties than among those in large urban counties, 4.5-fold 
higher among women who smoked cigarettes during pregnancy, 
and nearly 17-fold higher among women with concurrent hepa-
titis B virus (HBV) infection. HCV infection among pregnant 
women is an increasing and potentially modifiable threat to 
maternal and child health. Clinicians and public health officials 
should consider individual and population-level opportunities 
for prevention and risk mitigation.
Data from 2009–2014 were obtained from the National 
Vital Statistics System and Tennessee Department of Health 
vital records. The outcome of interest was HCV infection in 
pregnant women at the time of delivery (maternal HCV infec-
tion) as indicated on the infant’s birth certificate. The maternal 
HCV infection rate per 1,000 deliveries in Tennessee was 
compared with that from hospital billing data in the Tennessee 
Hospital Discharge Data System, an all-payer administrative 
database that includes data for all inpatient admissions in the 
state. National data were compared with nationally weighted 
estimates obtained from the National Inpatient Sample, the 
largest all payer database in the United States.†
* https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2014surveillance/index.htm.
† Maternal records were included in the analysis if they had one or more 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
(ICD-9-CM) diagnostic and procedure codes or Diagnosis Related Groups 
indicating delivery. HCV-positive women were identified using the following 
ICD-9-CM codes: 070.41, 070.44, 070.51, 070.54, 070.7, 070.70, and 070.71.
The first phase of the analysis examined rates of maternal 
HCV infection reported on infant birth certificates to approxi-
mate HCV infection among pregnant women in the United 
States. Because HCV infection is a revised 2003 birth certifi-
cate item, states gradually reported this item over time as they 
adopted the revised certificate; therefore, rates were calculated 
based on records from all states§ with available data at any time 
during 2009 and 2014.¶ The second phase of the analysis used 
data from Tennessee vital records to assess sociodemographic 
characteristics, gravidity, health behaviors, and other infections 
during pregnancy associated with HCV infection in pregnancy. 
Overall, <1% of data for variables included in the study were 
missing, with the exception of timing of prenatal care, which 
was missing for 6.2% of records. To account for missing data, 
multiple imputation using chained equations with 20 imputa-
tions was used. A multivariable logistic regression model was 
fit to the data to determine increased odds of HCV infection 
in pregnancy, simultaneously adjusting for maternal age, 
education, marital status, race/ethnicity, county of residence, 
number of previous pregnancies, late or no prenatal care, smok-
ing during pregnancy, and other infections present at delivery, 
including chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes simplex virus, 
and HBV. The statistical significance level was set to p<0.05 for 
all tests. The study was approved by the Tennessee Department 
of Health’s institutional review board.
During 2009–2014, the prevalence of maternal HCV infec-
tion among reporting states increased 89%, from 1.8 to 3.4 
per 1,000 live births (p<0.001). There was substantial state-
to-state variation in maternal HCV rates: in 2014, the highest 
rate (22.6 per 1,000 live births) was in West Virginia, and 
the lowest (0.7) was in Hawaii (Figure 1). In Tennessee, the 
prevalence of maternal HCV infection increased 163%, from 
3.8 per 1,000 live births in 2009 to 10.0 in 2014 (p<0.001). 
Within Tennessee, there was substantial variation among 95 
counties, with the highest rates in the 52 Appalachian counties 
in the eastern part of the state. For example, in 2014, Campbell 
County had the highest rate in Tennessee (78 per 1,000 births); 
19 other counties had rates of ≤1 per 1,000 births, including 18 
counties that reported no cases (Figure 2). Analysis of maternal

Rhode Island. Data also were not available for the District of Columbia.

and 3.6% (2014).

HCV infection rates based on hospital discharge data resulted 
in similar findings.
In adjusted analyses of Tennessee births from 2009 to 
2014, compared with women without HCV infection, 
women with diagnosed HCV at the time of live birth had 
higher odds of having a high school education or less, being 
unmarried, having late or no prenatal care, and smoking 
cigarettes. Compared with pregnant non-Hispanic white 
women, non-Hispanic black women had nearly 80% lower 
odds, and Hispanic women nearly 70% lower odds of hav-
ing a diagnosis of HCV. Residing in a rural county was also 
associated with higher odds of maternal HCV infection. 
When compared with large central metro areas (counties with 
>1,000,000 population), the odds of HCV infection among 
pregnant women from rural areas (counties with <50,000 
population) were threefold higher. Concurrent infections 
also were associated with higher odds of having an HCV 
diagnosis, with HBV infection resulting in nearly 17-fold 
increased odds of HCV (Table).
Discussion
From 2009 to 2014, the prevalence of HCV infection among 
U.S. women giving birth in reporting states nearly doubled. 
This increase in maternal HCV infection mirrors increases in 
HCV infection incidence among adults, particularly nonpreg-
nant young adults in the United States. A recent study identi-
fied a similar increase in HCV prevalence among women with 
recent live births (2); this study builds upon those findings, 
identifying several patient-level characteristics associated with 
maternal HCV infection, including white race, rural county 
residence, cigarette smoking during pregnancy, having a high 
school education or less, and having a concurrent HBV infec-
tion. In the United States, CDC and the American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend selective screen-
ing of pregnant women at high risk for HCV infection (i.e., 
history of injection drug use or long-term hemodialysis) (3). 
These data might inform expansion of the definition of women 
at risk, thereby improving clinical detection, particularly in 
areas of a state reporting increasing or high rates of incident 
HCV infection.
The recent increase in maternal HCV infection appears to 
have disproportionately affected rural and white populations; 
states and Tennessee counties with the highest prevalence of 
HCV infection among pregnant women in 2014 were in 
predominately Appalachian regions.** A recent analysis of 
state surveillance data examining acute HCV infections in 
the general population found a near doubling of cases in the 
United States during 2006–2012, and also found that states 
in or near Appalachian regions had the highest numbers of 
cases (4), suggesting that primary prevention and testing and 
treatment strategies for HCV infection could be targeted to 
these populations and areas at high risk.
This increase in HCV infection is particularly concerning 
in light of recent research highlighting poor follow-up of 
HCV-exposed infants (5). The rate of vertical transmission 
from infected mothers to infants is estimated at 6% (11% if 
the mother is coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus 
[HIV]) (6); therefore, it is important that exposed infants be 
followed for evidence of seroconversion. Because passively 
acquired maternal antibodies can persist for up to 18 months, 
anti-HCV antibody tests cannot be completed until that time; 
however, testing for HCV RNA can be performed earlier (7). 
A recent study in Philadelphia found that only 16% of HCV-
exposed infants were appropriately followed (5), suggesting 
that infected infants might go undetected.
The increase in maternal HCV infection coincides with the 
rising heroin and prescription opioid epidemics occurring in 
the United States that have also disproportionately affected 
rural and white populations (8,9). There has also been a recent 
surge in opioid use among pregnant women (8). Whereas HCV 
infections have historically been associated with heroin use, a 
recent outbreak of HIV and HCV in rural Indiana demon-
strates that these infections can also be transmitted through 
use of injectable forms of prescription opioids (10).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions. First, vital records data rely on accurate coding of birth

certificates; some variables such as HCV might be undercoded, 
and misclassification bias might occur. However, evaluation 
of hospital administrative data reporting of HCV infections 
suggests that this effect is small. Second, the proportion of live 
births from which data were collected on HCV status increased 
during the study period, as more states adopted the revised cer-
tificate each year. Because the original reporting states in 2009 
were not held constant over time for this analysis, it is possible 
the trend could be subject to ascertainment bias; however, two 
additional confirmatory analyses were performed: 1) comparison 
with the National Inpatient Sample demonstrated similar rates 
of HCV infection during 2009–2013 (1.8 per 1,000 to 3.1 per 
1,000), and 2) the same trend analysis was performed holding 
the original 28 reporting states in 2009 constant. Results were 
the same as when using all 47 states that incorporated reporting 
over time. Because women are not universally screened for HCV 
in pregnancy, these estimates and analyses do not represent the 
actual prevalence of HCV in pregnant women. However, the 
findings of increased disease prevalence among white and rural 
populations are similar to those of recent studies in nonpregnant 
populations (4). Instances of multiple births might have resulted 
in a slight overestimation of rates of maternal HCV infection. 
Finally, it is important to consider that HCV infections in a 
given state might represent not only the prevalence of a condi-
tion but also the public health efforts implemented to detect 
and treat the infection.
The prevalence of maternal HCV infection appears to have 
increased sharply in the United States, presenting concerns for 
maternal and child health. Ensuring that women of childbear-
ing age have access to HCV testing and treatment and consid-
eration of universal screening among women of reproductive 
age residing in areas with high HCV prevalence might mitigate 
risk and prevent transmission.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects approximately 
3.5 million persons in the United States, making it the most 
common bloodborne infection in the nation. Recent surveil-
lance data demonstrate increased rates of HCV infection among 
adolescents and adults who are predominantly white, live in 
nonurban areas, and have a history of injection drug use.
What is added by this report?
During 2009–2014, maternal HCV infections nearly doubled 
among reporting states in the United States, with substantial 
state-to-state variation in prevalence. In adjusted analyses of 
Tennessee births, residence in a rural county was associated 
with a more than threefold increase in the odds of maternal 
HCV infection. Smoking during pregnancy and concurrent 
hepatitis B virus infection imparted fourfold and nearly 17-fold 
increased odds of maternal HCV infection, respectively.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Screening for HCV infection in women of childbearing age and 
provision of treatment services might reduce perinatal trans-
mission of HCV, and monitoring of HCV-exposed infants can aid 
in early identification of HCV infection and related liver disease.
