The aim of this review was to assess the severity of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) due to herb–drug interactions (HDI) in patients
taking herbs and prescribed medications based on published evidence. Electronic databases of PubMed, the Cochrane Library,
Medline and Scopus were searched for randomized or nonrandomized clinical studies, case–control and case reports of HDI. The
data were extracted and the causal relationship of ADRs as consequences of HDI assessed using Horn’s drug interaction
probability scale or Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method scoring systems. The mechanism of interaction was ascertained
using Stockley’s herbal medicine interaction companion. Forty-nine case reports and two observational studies with 15 cases of
ADRs were recorded. The majority of the patients were diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases (30.60%), cancer (22.45%) and
renal transplants (16.32%) receiving mostly warfarin, alkylating agents and cyclosporine, respectively. HDI occurred in patients
resulting in clinical ADRs with different severity. Patients may poorly respond to therapeutic agents or develop toxicity due to
severe HDI, which in either scenario may increase the cost of treatment and/or lead to or prolong patient hospitalization. It is
warranted to increase patient awareness of the potential interaction between herbs and prescribed medicines and their
consequences to curb HDI as a potential health problem.
Introduction
The risk of herb–drug interaction (HDI) is increasingly
recognized as a public health problem often accompanied
by life-threatening adverse drug events, prolonged hospital-
ization and loss of life [1]. With a rise in global burden of
noncommunicable diseases [2–5], pain syndromes, anxiety,
depression and aging [6, 7], co-usage of prescribed medica-
tions and herbal products will persistently be a potential
health problem in both developed and developing nations.
For instance, cases of acute rejection episodes have been
reported in heart, renal or liver transplant patients stabi-
lized on immunosuppressives including cyclosporine and
tacrolimus due to concomitant intake of St John’s wort
(SJW) known to induce drug metabolizing enzymes [8, 9].
In two case reports, patients with a history of generalized
anxiety disorder and mild traumatic brain injury experi-
enced serotonin syndrome and hypomania after addition
of SJW or Ginkgo biloba to either a buspirone or fluoxetine
regimen [10, 11]. Patients’ deliberate refusal to disclose
their use of herbal medicines to clinicians have led to
underreporting of clinically relevant HDI cases. In addi-
tion, underestimation of the consequences of HDI due to
lack of a standardized probability scoring system has con-
tributed to wrong classification of the causality of adverse
drug reactions (ADRs). Different experimental models have
been used to understand the mechanism of such interac-
tions [12–15].

 In most instances, in vitro and animal studies are
conducted to evaluate the effect of herbal extracts and phy-
tochemical constituents on pharmacokinetic and pharma-
codynamic properties of probe drugs [16–22]. However,
preclinical investigations often do not correlate with find-
ings in human subjects [23–27]. Clinical studies in patients
adopting a population pharmacokinetic approach is con-
sidered as the gold standard to determine the clinical con-
sequences of potential interaction of herbal medicines with
prescribed medications [28]. Nevertheless, pharmacokinetic
interaction studies are often conducted in healthy subjects
[29, 30]. Incidences of ADRs are rarely reported in these
types of studies due to limited number of co-administered
drugs, small sample size, lack of an appropriate placebo
arm and the recruitment of healthy young subjects. Only
a few cases recorded HDI-linked ADRs and the causality of
adverse effect was assessed using an appropriate classifica-
tion tool [31, 32].
Few studies have adapted the Naranjo tool to classify
the severity of HDI [33, 34]. The Naranjo tool was designed
to evaluate ADRs due to a single agent, and it is thus less
useful for the categorization of HDI linked ADRs [35].
Fugh-Berman and Ernst developed a 10-point scoring sys-
tem to assess the reliability scale of HDI [36]. Later, Horn
and colleagues proposed a specific tool for causality assess-
ment of drug–drug interactions by adopting the Naranjo
scale as a guide. The Horn’s drug interaction probability
scale (DIPS) consists of 10 questions each with three re-
sponse options to which a score is assigned [37]. In 1985,
the French pharmaceutical company Roussel Uclaf orga-
nized a consensus meeting for experts in hepatology to de-
fine terminologies used in drug induced liver injuries (DILI)
assessment and qualitative criteria based on the French
causality assessment method (CAM). The meeting out-
comes included additional criteria and assigned weight to
each criterion leading to the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assess-
ment Method (RUCAM). RUCAM is regarded as a well-
established tool for qualitative assessment of causality in
cases of suspected herb-induced liver injury (HILI) and DILI
[38–40]. Nevertheless, only a few HDI studies have applied
the Horn’s DIPS and RUCAM scores to ascertain the causal
relationship of ADRs. In addition, for studies where one or
both classification systems were used, the mechanism of
HDI was either unclear or not reported. Stockley’s herbal
medicine interaction companion contains arrays of herbal
medicines with documented literature of interaction stud-
ies conducted in vitro, in animal models and healthy sub-
jects [41]. Observational and survey control studies have
adopted this companion to flag herbal medicines with po-
tential to cause adverse effect due to interaction with pre-
scribed medications. Such information could be useful in
educating both clinicians and patients about the conse-
quences of consuming herbal medicines with prescribed
medications based on established reports. This review,
therefore, aims to conduct causality assessment on HDI in
clinical trials, case–controls studies, and case reports in
in/out-patients from January 2001 to August 2017 using
Horn’s DIPS for general HDI and RUCAM for HILI specific
injuries, respectively. In addition, the mechanism of HDI
was evaluated by using Stockley’s herbal medicines interac-
tion companion.
Methods
Databases of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Medline and
Scopus were searched from January 2001 to August 2017.
A combination of the following keywords were used for ti-
tle, abstract and keywords fields: herbal drugs, herbal sup-
plements, phytochemicals, drug interactions, herb–drug
interactions, side effect and adverse-effects. Preliminary as-
sessment was conducted on abstracts retrieved from the da-
tabases to identify publications that met the pre-specified
criteria. Articles describing randomized or nonrandomized
clinical studies, case–control and case reports in both in-
and
out-patients
where
conventional
medications
and
herbal medicines were co-administered met the inclusion
criteria. The review excluded all HDI studies conducted in
healthy subjects, in vitro and in vivo models and other
sources of natural products. Reference lists from eligible
publications were another source for articles included in
this review. Full text articles of abstracts meeting the
eligibility criteria were extracted, validated and summarized
(Table 1). Two independent reviewers (C.A. and M.M.)
conducted causality assessment on validated data using
the Horn’s DIPS for general ADRs or RUCAM for HILI.
The
Stockley’s
herbal
medicine
interaction
companion
was consulted in cases where the mechanism of interaction
was not reported.
The results of this review are divided into two parts: 1)
characteristics of studies, and 2) tabularized description of
studies, probability score and mechanism of interactions.
Results
The
initial
electronic
database
search
identified
5113
articles, of which 1963 were screened after removal of
duplications. In total 5035 publications were excluded
based on titles and abstracts. On application of the review
inclusion criteria to the 78 full-text papers, a further 24
articles were excluded. Five additional papers were discarded
because full text of two studies were not available, two papers
in German and one paper in Turkish could not be translated
into English. Thus, 49 full text articles consisting of 47 case
reports publications and two observational studies were
included in this review. One publication presented three
different reports and hence, 49 case reports were reviewed.
The majority of the case reports described patients between
51–69 years (n = 12, 24.49%) and older than 70 years
(n = 11, 22.45%), respectively. Fifteen of the patients
(30.60%) had a history of cardiovascular conditions such as
hypertension, dyslipidaemia, myocardial infarction, atrial fi-
brillation and cardiomyopathy. Thirteen patients (86.67%)
with a history of cardiovascular conditions were on warfarin
treatment. Eleven cases (22.45%) were cancer patients of
whom the majority were on alkylating agents (busulfan,
temozolomide and trabectedin) and/or kinase inhibitors
(imatinib and gefitinib). There were eight case reports of
patients with renal transplant (16.33%) of which five patients
(62.5%) received cyclosporine as immunosuppressive agent.
Three HIV positive patients received a protease inhibitor
(lopinavir), an integrase inhibitor (raltegravir) or a non-

 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (efavirenz). There
were eight patients (16.33%) with central nervous system dis-
eases such as depression, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders
and seizures. The patients with central nervous system
disorders received anticonvulsants (lamotrigine and phenyt-
oin), atypical antipsychotics (clozapine), a selective seroto-
nin reuptake inhibitor (sertraline) or a norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitor (venlafaxine). Concomitant intake of

 SJW and Panax ginseng were recorded in patients treated with
warfarin, cyclosporine or kinase inhibitors (gefitinib and ima-
tinib). HDI cases reported to be probable and highly probable
were 25 (51.02%) and four (8.16%), respectively. Eighteen
cases (36.73%) were classified as possible whilst two cases
(4.08%) were identified to be doubtful. The predominant
ADRs were elevated liver enzymes, INR, GIT disturbances
and rhabdomyolysis. The detailed descriptions and causality
scales of the 49 cases included in this review are presented in
Table 2.
The majority of patients in the two observational studies
were aged between 51–61 years. Female patients (532
patients, 69.0%) constituted the majority. Most of the
patients had a history of metabolic, cardiovascular, endocrine
or haemato-oncological complications (Table 1). In the study
by Jeong et al., six cases of ADRs were reported [31]. Four
ADRs were reported in patients with a history of cerebral
infarction taking herbal concoctions with NSAIDs (aspirin
and diclofenac), P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel) and analgesic
(paracetamol) experiencing probable HDI (Table 3). Levy
et al., reported nine cases of ADRs as a consequences of
herbal medicine intake [32]. The majority of the cases in this
study were due to interaction between warfarin and sage or
flaxseed (Table 3).
Discussion
Concomitant intake of herbal medicines and prescribed med-
ications is a common practice, especially in patients with hy-
pertension, diabetes, cancer, seizures and depression. This is
problematic particularly for drugs exhibiting a narrow
therapeutic index. Incidences of underreporting and non-
standardized causality estimation of HDI in patients have re-
sulted in life-threatening ADRs, hospitalization and fatality
in some cases [87–89]. Intensification of monitoring and
critical appraisal procedures to identify the severity of ADRs
linked to concomitant consumption of herbs and prescribed
medicines is critical in averting untoward occurrences.
The WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug
Monitoring-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) has the
mandate to co-ordinate global ADRs data and search this data
to identify signals of new ADRs to notify the pharmaco-
vigilance centres of member countries and other organizations
concerned with drug safety. In a study conducted by WHO-
UMC the majority of HDI-linked ADRs reported were from
developed countries, including USA and Europe with South
Africa as the only contributory developing country [90] and
this re-affirms the concern of underreporting of HDIs in
developing countries. Adverse reactions related to HDIs have
been documented in observational studies and case reports
[70, 71, 83, 84, 91]. Nonetheless, few review studies have been
conducted to estimate the severity of the ADRs due to HDI in
patients. Hence, this review adapted the DIPS and RUCAM
scores to estimate the severity of ADRs, whilst the Stockley’s
herbal medicines interaction companion was consulted in
assessing the mechanism of interactions.
The majority of cases recorded in this study showed that
patients taking warfarin and/or statins (atorvastatin, simva-
statin
and
rosuvastatin)
for
the
management
of
cardiovascular complications reported clinically significant
interactions after combination with herbal products includ-
ing sage, flaxseed, SJW, cranberry, goji juice, green tea and
chamomile. Warfarin is a racemic mixture of R and S stereo-
isomers with S-warfarin being a 3–5 times more potent inhib-
itor of the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex than the R
isomer. Warfarin is used for the management of atrial fibrilla-
tion and heart valve replacement. Metabolism of S-warfarin is
predominantly mediated by CYP2C9. Herbal medicines alter-
ing the activity of CYP2C9 may cause under-anticoagulation
or bleeding episodes. Potential interaction of warfarin and
active constituents of sage, flaxseed, goji juice, cranberry
and chamomile led to ADRs such as ecchymosis, epistaxis,
haematuria, hemiplegia and elevated INR [33, 63, 74, 76,
85]. The active constituents of SJW namely hyperforin, flavo-
nols, flavonol glycosides, biflavones, napthodianthrones,
acylphloroglucinols and phenylpropranes are known to
reduce plasma concentration of warfarin via induction of
CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. However, one case study reported
SJW to cause sudden upper GIT bleeding in a sensitive patient
[61]. This interaction might have been caused by active con-
stituents of SJW potentiating the clotting effect of warfarin.
In addition, the Chinese herbal product Sheg Mai-yin is used
to improve peripheral circulation due to its effect on
oxidative damage in heart, brain and other tissues. Sheg
Mai-yin contains red ginseng, liriope and Schisandra chinesis.
A case of intracranial haematoma has been reported in a
patient with a history of aortic valve and mitral valve
replacement receiving warfarin and Sheg Mai-yin [63]. Red
ginseng enhances the production of interleukin-1β, which
increases the production of tissue plasminogen activators
responsible for suppression of thrombin formation during
blood coagulation and fibrinolysis processes [92]. Further-
more, the saponin-related active constituents of red ginseng,
namely ginsenosides Rg1 and Rg5, downregulate plasmino-
gen inhibitor 1, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, coagulation
factors XIII, A1 and coagulation factor II (thrombin) receptor
(FR2), which may lead to increase INR [93].
Besides
anticoagulants,
patients
with
cardiovascular
complications (coronary artery disease) often take statins,
including atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin and others
to lower low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol levels.
However, many patients on statins complain of muscle pain,
which affects quality of life and adherence to treatment.
Statin-induced muscle intolerance could be elicited by its
co-usage with herbal supplements and other prescribed
medications. For example, a patient receiving amlodipine
(10 mg day–1) and simvastatin (10 mg day–1) complained of
intense leg muscle cramps and pain after ingestion of green
tea [73]. This was attributed to a 2-fold increase plasma levels
of simvastatin lactone due to inhibitory effect of green tea on
CYP3A4 [94, 95]. However, further studies need to be
conducted to ascertain other potential mechanisms for statin
intolerance due to green tea intake.
In organ transplant patients, tacrolimus and cyclosporine
A
are
principal
immunosuppressive
agents
commonly
administered to protect and reduce episodes of organ rejec-
tion. Both drugs have a narrow therapeutic index and are
metabolized primarily by CYP3A4/5. Herbal medicines that
alter the activities of CYP3A4 are likely to affect the protective
effect of tacrolimus and cyclosporine in transplant patients.

 Cases of treatment failure or toxicity have been reported in
patients consuming tacrolimus, azathioprine and cyclospor-
ine with herbal preparations such as turmeric or chamomile
tea [43, 50, 79, 82]. The active phytoconstituents of the herbal
medicines inhibit CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein to reduce
elimination of the immunosuppressive agents [96–100].
Tacrolimus and cyclosporine bind to immunophilins to
block calcineurin’s mediated T-lymphocyte activation. In
general, increased plasma levels of calcineurins have been
reported
to
trigger
calcineurin-induced
vasoconstriction
and release of endothelin-1 (a potent vasoconstrictor),
decrease production of nitric oxide and increase expression
of transforming growth factor β1 in renal transplantation
patients [101]. Thus, the active ingredients of turmeric and
chamomile induced nephrotoxicity in patients taking tacro-
limus and/or cyclosporine via CYP3A4 inhibition. For probe
drugs such as azathioprine, metabolic transformation of par-
ent compound to the active moiety 6-mercaptopurine by
glutathione S transferase (GST) and subsequent inactivation
to 6-methylmercaptopurine by thiopurine methyltransfer-
ase (TPMT) is necessary [102]. Herbal medicines capable of
altering the activity of GST and/or TPMT could potentially
induce clinically significant ADRs.
Other immunocompromised patients, including those
with HIV infections, often take herbs for various reasons,
and as immune boosters. A number of antiretroviral medica-
tions including protease inhibitors (lopinavir and ritonavir)
and
non-nucleoside
reverse
transcriptase
inhibitors
(efavirenz and nevirapine) with narrow therapeutic indices
and elimination via hepatic metabolism are susceptible to
HDI.
HIV
patients
experienced
signs
of
toxicity
and
detectable levels of viral load while taking raltegravir plus
lopinavir/ritonavir [58] or efavirenz [59] with ginseng and
G. biloba, respectively. The mechanism of ginseng–raltegravir
interaction is unknown, as several conflicting outcomes have
been reported on the influence of various active ingredients
of ginseng on CYP450 enzymes [103–105]. However, one
study reported ginseng-mediated hepatotoxicity in a chronic
myeloid leukaemia patient on imatinib due to inhibition of
CYP3A4 [34]. The inhibitory effect of ginseng on CYP3A4
was thus probably accountable for the observed adverse effect
of raltegravir. For G. biloba, a unique active ingredient,
bilobalide, has been demonstrated to induce CYP2B6 mRNA
in animal models, although such a result was irreproducible
in human subjects [106, 107]. In a patient taking efavirenz
and ginkgo, it is speculated that a breakthrough in viral load
occurred because of a decrease in plasma levels of EFV as
consequence of the inductive effect of active ingredients in
G. biloba.
The current review study also recorded a significant
number of HDI cases in patients with depression and seizure
disorders. Antidepression medications, including valafaxine
and sertraline, are eliminated primarily by hepatic metabo-
lism. Patients taking these medications with herbal drugs
including QR and Mentat for arthritis and celery root for
menopause developed episodes of worsening depression
[45, 68]. In addition, cases of seizure induction occurred in a
patient taking either phenytoin or valproic acid after con-
suming G. biloba supplement. In one recorded case, seizure
induction led to the demise of a patient while swimming.
The autopsy results confirmed a decreased plasma levels of
both phenytoin and valproic due to inductive effect of G.
biloba on CYP2C19 [80]. Another study in 18 healthy
Chinese subjects showed significant reduction in plasma
concentration of omeprazole as a probe substrate of CYP2C19
in the presence of G. biloba compared to the controls [108].
Furthermore, Ginkgo contains a potent neurotoxin, 40-0-
methoxypyridoxine, which indirectly inhibits glutamate de-
carboxylase and glycine activities leading to seizure induc-
tion
[109].
The
effect
of
40-0-methoxypyridoxine
on
inhibitory neurotransmitters is predicted as the most likely
cause of seizure induction leading to his demise since
CYP2C19 would have accounted only for a minor proportion
of phenytoin and valproic acid elimination.
Finally, the consumption of herbal medicines is a well-
known practice among cancer patients [110–113]. Currently,
imatinib is the main drug for the treatment of chronic
myeloid leukaemia. It is a first- generation inhibitor of bcr-
abl tyrosine kinase enzyme. Imatinib is primarily metabo-
lized by CYP3A4, and hence, any herbal medicine that alters
the activity of CYP3A4, may affect the activity of imatinib.
Concomitant intake of imatinib and an energy drink contain-
ing P
. ginseng led to aberrant liver enzyme levels in a patient
[34]. Previous study showed that ginseng increases plasma
concentrations
of
prescribed
medications
via
CYP3A4
inhibition [105]. Thus, the reduced activity of CYP3A4 in
the presence of P
. ginseng precipitated imatinib-induced hepa-
totoxicity characterized by late-stage acute lobular hepatitis
[105].
Other
chemotherapeuticals
such
as
cisplatin,
etoposide and trabectedin have been reported to interact
with herbal medicines, including Echinacea purpurea [60]
and chokeberry juice (Aronia melanocarpa) [53] in patients
presenting with different types of cancer. Chokeberry con-
tains concentrated flavonoids – procyanidin B5, cyaniding-
3-arabinoside and quercetin – which strongly inhibit CYP3A4
activity in the liver [114]. Thus, reduced activity of CYP3A4
due to chokeberry intake caused trabectedin-induced rhabdo-
myolysis in this patient [53]. Conversely, echinacea has a
mild inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 activity, which is likely to
potentiate the myelosuppressive effect of etoposide and
could elicit neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in patients.
Conclusion
Patients taking herbal medicines containing G. biloba,
P
. ginseng, SJW, green tea and others affecting the pharmaco-
kinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of prescribed med-
ications are at risk of experiencing different degrees of HDI.
Few case reports of potential HDI have been documented in
the literature despite the detrimental consequences of such
interactions. In addition, even in cases where HDI were
reported in patients, inadequate provision of information
hindered the utilization of the data to draw clinically mean-
ingful conclusions. Generally, these challenges could be
attributed to a number of reasons including: (i) inability to
re-challenge patients with the herbs involved to confirm
the causal relationship of the interaction for ethical reasons;
(ii) lack of analytical capacity to measure the plasma levels
of the affected drug; (iii) difficulty in identification of the
phytochemical
responsible
for
the
interaction;
(iv)
nonexistence of adequate genetic information especially
Herbs interact with prescribed medicines

689
 for high-risk drugs, such as clopidogrel, warfarin, codeine,
tamoxifen or terbinafine; (v) lack of standardized HDI-
specific causality assessment tool; and (vi) lack of motiva-
tion of clinicians to publish HDI case reports. Critical
assessment of the causality of ADRs using the recommended
scoring systems reported in this study will strengthen the
applicability of HDI data in clinical practice. In addition,
mechanistic investigations in healthy subjects and in vitro
liver models as a follow-up study on herbs recorded to
elicit clinically significant HDI in patients. Thus, we recom-
mend
a
bench-to-bed-side
approach to understand the
causal relationship of HDI linked ADRs and the potential
mechanism of observed interactions. This approach will in-
form drug regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical compa-
nies about the need to update information in package
inserts of medicines to avoid untoward adverse events, based
on available data. In conclusion, causality assessment and
subsequent mechanistic studies of herbs with clinically rele-
vant HDI must be publicized to alert both clinicians and pa-
tients about the need to avoid co-usage of certain herbal
medicines with specific prescribed medications.
