Abstract
AIM
To determine the short-term biochemical effects and 
clinical tolerability of intermittent fasting (IF) in adults 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS
We describe a three-phase observational study (baseline 
2 wk, intervention 2 wk, follow-up 2 wk) designed to 
determine the clinical, biochemical, and tolerability of 
IF in community-dwelling volunteer adults with T2DM. 
Biochemical, anthropometric, and physical activity 
measurements (using the Yale Physical Activity Survey) 
were taken at the end of each phase. Participants 
reported morning, afternoon and evening self-monitored 
blood glucose (SMBG) and fasting duration on a daily 
basis throughout all study stages, in addition to com-
pleting a remote food photography diary three times 
within each study phase. Fasting blood samples were 
collected on the final days of each study phase. 
RESULTS
At baseline, the ten participants had a confirmed 
diagnosis of T2DM and were all taking metformin, and 
on average were obese [mean body mass index (BMI) 
36.90 kg/m
2]. We report here that a short-term period

Arnason TG et al. Impact of intermittent fasting on T2DM
of IF in a small group of individuals with T2DM led to 
significant group decreases in weight (-1.395 kg, P = 
0.009), BMI (-0.517, P = 0.013), and at-target morning 
glucose (SMBG). Although not a study requirement, all 
participants preferentially chose eating hours starting in 
the midafternoon. There was a significant increase (P 
< 0.001) in daily hours fasted in the IF phase (+5.22 
h), although few attained the 18-20 h fasting goal 
(mean 16.82 ± 1.18). The increased fasting duration 
improved at-goal (< 7.0 mmol/L) morning SMBG to 
34.1%, from a baseline of 13.8%. Ordinal Logistic 
Regression models revealed a positive relationship 
between the increase in hours fasted and fasting 
glucose reaching target values (χ
2 likelihood ratio = 
8.36, P = 0.004) but not for afternoon or evening SMBG 
(all P > 0.1). Postprandial SMBGs were also improved 
during the IF phase, with 60.5% readings below 9.05 
mmol/L, compared to 52.6% at baseline, and with less 
glucose variation. Neither insulin resistance (HOMA-
IR), nor inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein) 
normalized during the IF phase. IF led to an overall 
spontaneous decrease in caloric intake as measured by 
food photography (Remote Food Photography Method). 
The data demonstrated discernable trends during IF 
for lower energy, carbohydrate, and fat intake when 
compared to baseline. Physical activity, collected by a 
standardized measurement tool (Yale Physical Activity 
Survey), increased during the intervention phase and 
subsequently decreased in the follow-up phase. IF 
was well tolerated in the majority of individuals with 
6/10 participants stating they would continue with the 
IF regimen after the completion of the study, in a full 
or modified capacity (i.e., every other day or reduced 
fasting hours).
CONCLUSION
The results from this pilot study indicate that short-
term daily IF may be a safe, tolerable, dietary inter-
vention in T2DM patients that may improve key out-
comes including body weight, fasting glucose and 
postprandial variability. These findings should be viewed 
as exploratory, and a larger, longer study is necessary to 
corroborate these findings.

Core tip: Intermittent fasting (IF) involves limiting food 
intake into a single 4 to 8 h period, daily. We observed 
the tolerability, safety and health benefits of IF in 10 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients during a 
2-wk IF intervention. Outcomes were measured after 
the three study phases; baseline, intervention, and 
follow-up. Although short, the IF phase significantly 
improved weight loss and fasting glucose levels, was 
well tolerated, and hypoglycemia was not observed. 
During follow-up, glucose levels reverted. This simple, 
outpatient-directed dietary manipulation may prove 
valuable in T2DM individuals with exercise intolerance, 
who are resistant to complex diet regimes, or are not at 
glycemic goals.

INTRODUCTION
The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is 
reaching epidemic levels worldwide, and correlates with 
rising obesity rates and sedentary lifestyles. In fact, it 
is predicted that 439 million adults will have diabetes 
by 2030
[1]. This is significant, as diabetes is closely 
associated with cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, 
neuropathy, and kidney disease. In turn, this places 
increasing stress on the health care system, and these 
patients utilize medical resources three to four times the 
amount of those without diabetes
[2].
Modest weight loss and exercise regimes can both 
prevent the onset of T2DM and improve metabolic 
control
[3]. According to most national diabetes associa­
tions and clinical practice, dietary interventions are 
considered essential in the treatment and prevention of 
diabetes­related complications
[4]. There are many types 
of dietary interventions people may use; one of which 
is intermittent fasting (IF). This is a dietary intervention 
that time­restricts feeding to 4­6 h and extends the 
overnight fast from 12 towards 18 or 20 h, may be 
a beneficial additional dietary strategy used in T2DM 
management. 
After diagnosis, most individuals (depending on 
individual circumstances) with T2DM are given manage­
ment goals of an HbA1c below 7.0%, FPG 4.0­7.0 
mmol/L, and post­prandial levels of 5.0­10.0 mmol/
L
[3,5,6]. Self­monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) using 
glucometers can be critical for patient feedback and 
recognition of glucose control, as symptoms poorly 
predict glucose levels alone. Glucose goals are typically 
reached through an individualized treatment regime 
including lifestyle (diet and exercise) and medication 
use, yet a great number fail to reach, or maintain, these 
diabetic goals. As a result, a plethora of medication 
combinations are tried, as are weight loss approaches 
including consideration for bariatric surgery for morbidly 
obese individuals. Given the intense focus on weight and 
dietary measures, IF has the potential to be included in 
the armament in the fight to improve SMBG levels while 
contributing to weight loss in those in whom it would be 
beneficial. 
In addition to glucose levels and body weight, there 
are other important aspects of T2DM worth considering. 
First is the degree of insulin resistance, which theore­
 156

tically contributes to the difficulty of maintaining 
euglycemia
[7]. Outside of the research clinic, insulin 
resistance can be measured in healthy patients using 
surrogate index measures derived from glucose and 
insulin measures in the fasting state. These surrogate 
index measures include glucose/insulin ratio, log fasting 
insulin, Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA­IR), log 
HOMA­IR, and Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check 
Index (QUICK1). A decrease in insulin resistance can 
improve glucose control, and exercise and weight loss 
both favorably decrease resistance states. Hence, we 
measured HOMA­IR, which has the most agreement 
with the clamp technique in assessing insulin resistance 
in T2DM patients
[8], to help determine if IF may be 
beneficial. 
Although the causal role is unknown, an association 
between chronic low-grade inflammation and diabetes 
has been shown to occur
[9]. C­reactive protein (CRP) 
is a biomarker used to determine if inflammation is 
present. Elevated levels of CRP have been associated 
with insulin resistance, nephropathy progression and 
elevated fasting glucose in diabetes patients
[10,11]. It 
is also known that CRP can be decreased with dietary 
therapy
[12]. Hence, we measured CRP to see whether IF 
favorably decreased this inflammatory marker
.
It can be challenging to measure dietary and ex­
ercise habits in clinical studies, and there is no defined 
intervention that is shown to be better than one an­
other
[13]. Monitoring devices worn daily are acceptable 
methods of tracking physical activity
, with accelerometers 
being the current gold standard
[14]. An alternative 
method to use in free­living adults is a questionnaire. 
Although not the gold standard, they have been shown 
to be a reliable method. The Yale Physical Activity Survey 
(YPAS) is a particular questionnaire that has shown to 
be reliable for capturing physical activity
[14,15]. The YPAS 
has considerable test­retest reliability which makes it 
a useful tool for a repeated measures design in free 
living­adults
[16,17]. Hence, the YPAS questionnaire was 
employed to track physical activity in this study
. 
The gold standard for measuring energy intake is the 
Doubly­Labelled Water method (DLW)
[18]. However
, this 
is difficult to use in those who are not experienced. One 
alternative to the DLW is the remote food photography 
method (RFPM). The RFPM has been shown to be an 
efficient and accurate method of capturing dietary 
intake in free­living adults
[19,20]. Hence, the RFPM for 3 d 
in each of the study phases was utilized in this study to 
capture estimates of energy intake.
The Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) publishes 
Clinical Practice Guidelines that currently recommends 
that individuals with T2DM follow the Canada Food 
Guide for nutritional needs
[21]. Further
, the CDA pro­
motes various other nutritional strategies, such as 
portion control, carbohydrate counting, and grouping 
foods according to their glycemic index
[4]. While these 
are all appropriate recommendations, some people have 
difficulty grasping these suggestions and fitting them 
into their diet
[22]. Even an activity as simple as calorie­
counting has been reported to lead to an increase in 
self­perceived psychological stress and cortisol levels, 
effects not seen when participants restricted calories 
unintentionally
[23]. 
Another valuable resource for helping attain nutri­
tional and diabetic goals is for patients to see a dietitian 
and/or attend a self­management program. However
, 
many barriers exist for patients to access these programs 
or adhering to dietary advice
[24]. Some of the barriers 
listed by people with diabetes range from feelings of 
helplessness and frustration, to not attaining desired 
glycemic control, to not being able to accommodate sug­
gestions regarding food restrictions
[22,25].
To overcome some of the barriers that some dia­
betes patients face with dietary interventions, alter­
native solutions should be explored. An example of 
an alternative dietary solution is IF
. There are many 
variations of IF
, but it is essentially restricting caloric 
intake to a specified period of time. One method of IF is 
to have people restrict their caloric intake for 18 to 20 
h per day and eat ad libidum during those other 4 to 6 
h. The feeding period will usually occur midday to early 
evening, and an increased protein intake may or may 
not be recommended to help increase satiety. During 
the fasting period, people are allowed to consume 
water
, coffee, or tea. With this method of IF
, caloric 
intake occurs when there is a diurnal peak in insulin 
sensitivity, and, similarly, a diurnal peal in cortisol levels 
during the fasting period. This may theoretically benefit 
glucose control. Similar protocols have been shown to 
have beneficial effects in non-diabetic populations with 
varying effects on glucose uptake, lipid levels, cortisol 
levels, and body fat
[26­29]. Previous studies have shown 
that an IF intervention whereby all of one’s daily calorie 
consumption are consumed in a four­hour window 
led to participants feeling too full and some weight 
loss, despite recommendations to consume more 
calories
[26,27]. Hence, it is possible that IF can lead to 
a spontaneous caloric deficit in adult patients in their 
homes
[30]. However
, another study found that an IF 
intervention led to worsening of glycemic control
[27], 
hence there are conflicting results as to its overall 
effects in a healthy individuals. 
IF has received increasing attention for its potential 
therapeutic role in the treatment and prevention of 
cardiovascular disease and T2DM. However
, we could 
only identify 2 studies in the literature evaluating 
the effects of IF in T2DM, although other trials are 
ongoing. The first evaluated a Mediterranean-style diet, 
with and without breakfast, on postprandial glucose, 
insulin, triglycerides and gastric inhibitory polypeptide 
in individuals with T2DM over a single day
[31]. The 
Mediterranean lunch without breakfast revealed no 
increase in glucose, insulin, or triglycerides during 
the breakfast period (despite coffee intake), which 
did significantly increase above baseline during the 
comparator arms of low­fat and low­carbohydrate 
breakfasts. Another 12­wk had people undergo an IF 
fast whereby they only consumed caloric content in

the morning and early afternoon, and in this study, a 
decrease in FBG, HbA1c, and an improved response 
to an OGTT were observed
[32]. Given these potential 
benefits, we designed a short­term observational 
pilot study to assess tolerability, safety, and specific 
anthropomorphic, biochemical and blood glucose health 
benefits of daily IF in patients with T2DM, and measured 
their persistence upon return to an unstructured diet. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Recruitment
Participants were recruited from within the Saskatoon 
Health Region, which serves a population catchment of 
approximately 325000 people. Posters were delivered to 
general practitioners’ offices in Saskatoon, as well as the 
3 hospitals within the city of Saskatoon. Advertisements 
to the general public were placed in local newspapers 
and via internet outlets (i.e., Kijiji) alerting them of the 
study. 
Individuals with a diagnosis of T2DM (confirmed by 
fasting glucose > 7.0 mmol, HbA1c > 6.5%, or OGTT 
> 11.0 mmol) and between the ages of 18­65 were 
eligible to enroll in this study. Certain medical conditions 
were excluded from enrollment, such as the presence 
of ischemic heart disease or heart failure, chronic 
inflammatory diseases, chronic infections, moderate to 
severe renal disease (GFR < 45), uncontrolled hyper­
tension and hypoglycemic unawareness. Lastly, parti­
cipants were excluded if they currently managed their 
diabetes with either insulin or glyburide due to their 
increased risk of hypoglycemia.
Study design
Interested participants that met inclusion criteria pro­
vided written consent and were educated on study 
procedures, and the risk, detection and management 
of hypoglycemia. The study was divided into 3 phases, 
baseline (run­in), intervention, and follow­up (Figure 
1). During the baseline period, participants engaged 
in their normal dietary patterns (breakfast, lunch and 
dinner) for a period of 2 wk. During the intervention 
phase (weeks 3­4), participants were instructed to 
follow the IF meal timing pattern. This consisted of a 
fasting goal for a period of 18­20 h per day, with ad 
libidum zero­calorie coffee, tea, and water intake during 
fasting hours being permitted. During feeding time, 
participants were allowed to eat whatever they chose, 
but were encouraged to include at least 1/3 plate of 
protein to promote satiety (visual representations 
provided during training). The intervention phase was 
followed by a 2 wk follow­up phase with normal dietary 
patterns. There were no embedded criteria for weight 
loss, calorie restriction, or changes to exercise habits for 
the participants.
Assessment and evaluation
Self-reporting: Hours fasted, SMBG, caloric intake 
and exercise were all self­reported. Throughout all 
study phases, participants reported SMBG 3 times daily 
(fasting morning, random afternoon, and postprandial 
evening) with the use of a glucometer and logbook 
that was provided to them free of charge. In the same 
logbook, they also kept a diary of total consecutive 
hours fasted each day. In each of the three time 
periods (baseline, intervention, follow­up) participants 
completed a random 3­d food diary using the RFPM. 
During these days, participants received customized text 
message prompts by study staff to ensure compliance 
with RFPM. Participants responded to all text prompts 
to confirm that they had adhered to RFPM, as well as 
sent images of their food (before and after consumption 
to capture food waste). Physical activity/spontaneous 
energy expenditures were captured using the YPAS tool 
at the end of each of the study phases.
Biochemical and anthropometric measurements: 
Participants underwent fasted blood draws on the 
last day of the baseline phase, intervention phase, 
and follow­up phase. Fasting insulin, fasting plasma 
glucose (FPG) (with subsequent calculation for HOMA­
IR) and CRP were measured. On each of these days, 
participants also underwent anthropometric mea­
surements (height, weight, blood pressure, waist circum­
ference). These measurements were all performed by 
the same individual.
Statistical analysis
All statistical procedures were performed on SPSS v. 
22 and STATA v. 13. Data preparation was done using 
Excel 2011 and STATA v. 13. Significance was set at 
alpha = 0.05 (95%CI) for all tests. Repeat measures 
ANOVA were performed for measuring changes in 
anthropometric and biochemical changes. 
The group means and standard deviations of days 
1 through 42 (6 wk total study time) were calculated 
individually for three daily measurements: fasted 
morning (M), random afternoon (A), and postprandial 
evening (E) SMBG measurements. Linear and quadratic 
regression of group means and standard deviations 
were used to explore the relationship between study 
phase and SMBG. 
OLR was used to explore the impact of relative daily 
fasting duration on SMBG. Cut­offs for OLR were created 
using standards for the diabetic fasting goal (< 7.0 
mmol/L) and frank hyperglycemia (> 11.1 mmol/L), 
with an additional midpoint (9.05 mmol/L). The variable 
created for OLR was the hours fasted difference (HFD), 
the difference between actual hours fasted and the 
average hours fasted during the baseline phase (T
able 1).
No category was created to represent hypoglycemic 
events, as none were recorded throughout the duration 
of the study.

biochemical measurements (with standard deviation) 
of the ten participants at study entry. Normal values 
for clinical and biochemical parameters are referenced. 
Subjects had a mean age of 53.8 years old (ranging 
44­62) and BMI of 36.9 (range of 28­45 kg/m
2), the 
latter corresponding on average to Class II obesity, 
with very high disease risk compared to normal weight 
individuals. Insulin resistance was confirmed, with a 
mean HOMA­IR of 6.91, and baseline fasting blood 
glucose levels were above the goal of < 7.0 mmol/L 
(mean 7.45 mmol/L). A nonspecific biochemical marker 
of inflammation (CRP) was also elevated at baseline in 
this cohort. All participants took daily metformin as part 
of their diabetic management, eight as monotherapy. 
One participant was also taking gliclazide while another 
was also using liraglutide.

from a 2 wk dietary intervention of IF are shown in

up). Repeat measures ANOVA comparisons between 
study phases were done to reveal significant differences 
(P < 0.05). Clinical measures revealed that IF decreased

circumference as compared to baseline with significant 
changes only for body weight (­1.4 kg; P = 0.009) and

Figure 1 Study design. During the three-phase, 6 wk study, participants engaged in normal dietary patterns (breakfast, lunch and dinner) during weeks 1-2 (Phase 1, 
baseline) and 5-6 (Phase 3, follow-up). For weeks 3-4 (Phase 2, intervention) participants followed the IF meal timing pattern with a goal of daily fasts for 18-20 h per 
day, and a 4-6 h feeding period. Ad libidum zero-calorie intake, including coffee and tea during fasting hours, was permitted. Hours fasted and self-monitored blood 
glucose (fasted a.m., random afternoon pre-meal, postprandial evening) was reported daily throughout the study. On the last day (day 14, 28 and 42) of each phase, 
biochemical (fasting bloodwork), anthropomorphic (clinical assessment), and YPAS physical activity was collected. A 3-d consecutive photographic food diary was 
collected during each of the three phases. YPAS: Yale Physical Activity Survey; IF: Intermittent fasting.

were not sustained once the IF was complete. After a 
return to normal diet (Phase 3, follow­up), there was an 
inflection back toward baseline values for all parameters 
except a further non­significant decrease in waist 
circumference (­0.3, P = 1.0). All participants increased 
their fasting time during the intervention phase. The 
daily hours fasting increased from a baseline of 11.6 to 
16.8 h during the intervention phase (+5.2 h; P < 0.001), 
and essentially returned to baseline (11.5 h) after the 
follow­up period.
The averages of SMBG reported daily from home 
glucometers decreased during the intervention phase 
for fasting morning, afternoon and postprandial time 
points (T
able 4). Pooled averages of SMBG taken three 
times daily throughout the study are presented by 
study phase, indicating the % change from baseline to 
IF (Phase 1 to 2), and IF to follow­up (Phase 2 to 3).
IF improves morning fasted glucose levels and de­
creases postprandial variability. To further investigate 
potential benefits of IF on glucose levels, daily (rather 
than grouped by study phase) SMBGs were plotted 
over the 42 d study (Figure 2A). To investigate the 
glucose variances from the mean for fasting morning 
glucose levels, the Kolmogorov­Smirnov (KS) test was 
used. Figure 2B indicates that the daily distribution of 
morning SMBG was greatest during the intervention as 
compared to baseline (P = 0.002), or follow­up (P = 
0.003) phases. Lastly, a similar assessment of the daily 
variation from the mean for evening postprandial values 
(Figure 2C) demonstrates wide scatter throughout 
all phases, with decreases in glucose variability from 
baseline to intervention, as well as from intervention 
to follow­up phase. A significant difference was found 
for evening SMBG distributions (P = 0.044) between 
the intervention and follow­up phases only (all other 
phases P > 0.1). There were no statistically significant 
differences observed between any phases for the 
afternoon SMBG distributions (P > 0.1). 
IF enhances the proportion of fasting SMBG at 
goal and decreases postprandial glucose excursions. 
Raw SMBG counts and percentages of SMBG residing 
within defined glucose categories were tabulated for 
each study phase. T
able 5 reflects morning fasted and 
evening post­prandial SMBG. SMBG results were placed 
within four discrete glucose ranges including normal/
target fasting (< 7 mmol/L), frank hyperglycemia (> 
11.1 mmol/L), and an equal cut­off bridging the two 
(cut off at 9.05 mmol/L) to determine the cause of the 
increased variation noted for morning SMBG during IF
. 
The distributed results for fasting SMBG readings T
able 
5 highlight that the incidence of at­goal SMBG < 7.0 
mmol/L increased 2.5­fold during the IF intervention 
(13.8% baseline increased to 34.1% during IF). Also 
noted during IF was the overall decrease in fasting 
hyperglycemia (> 7.0 mmol/L) that was offset by a 
greater incidence of elevated fasting levels (> 11.1 
mmol/L noted at 0.8% baseline, increasing to 7.1% 
during IF). The improvement of readings at target 
glucose levels was lost during follow up, upon return to 
normal eating patterns.
Considering the pooled incidence of evening post­
prandial SMBG up to and including 9.05 mmol/L as 
“at­goal” for postprandial blood glucose, IF resulted 
in a higher proportion in the desirable range (Table 
5). Specifically, 65.7% of SMBG were < 9.05 mmol/L 
during the IF phase of the study, compared to 52.6%

at baseline. Similar levels (54.1%) were found at 
goal during the follow­up phase, as at baseline. The 
proportion of SMBG > 11.1 mmol/L changed little with 
IF
. The greatest change was found in the decrease in 
SMBG between 9.05­11.1 mmol/L, specific to the IF 
phase. 
The increase from baseline, rather than the absolute 
number
, of hours fasted improves the probability of 
optimal glucose control. HFD was calculated for baseline 
and intervention phases to explore the relationship 
between the increase in hours fasted from baseline 
and SMBG improvements. In order to determine the 
relationship between glucose levels and time spent 
fasting, OLR was performed on the non­equalized data 
sets from the 8 participants who had completed both 
their daily­hours­fasted and full SMBG logs. As presented 
in Figure 3, these results support the previous SMBG 
regression findings; mean morning SMBG readings 
decreased, and improvements in these readings were 
primarily a result of increased fasting hours from 
baseline. The HFD and OLR models showed a statistically 
significant association between change in HFD with 
decreased SMBG morning readings (
χ
2 likelihood ratio = 
8.36, P = 0.004) but not for afternoon or evening SMBG 
readings (P > 0.1, T
able 6). 
The IF phase was associated with spontaneous 
decreases in caloric intake and increases in physical 
activity. To calculate energy intake during the study, 
five (baseline and intervention) and four (follow­up) 
participants recorded their food intake via the RFPM. 
This was performed for 3 d of each study phase. 
From this, estimates of the total kcal/day, and the pro­
portionate contribution from protein, carbohydrate and 
fat was determined as shown in T
able 7. T
otal kcal/day 
decreased 18.6% with the IF intervention, and further 
decreased 6% into the follow­up phase. Carbohydrate 
and fat intake decreased 33% and 36% respectively 
during the IF period, whereas protein intake remained 
constant. T
o estimate physical activity during the study, 
all participants completed the YPAS once during each 
of the three phases. From this survey, an estimate 
of physical activity (kcal/wk) during the three study 
phases was determined. During the intervention phase, 
physical activity increased (+1856.3 kcal/wk), but 
then decreased at study end (in the follow­up phase; 
­2449.6 kcal/wk).
Figure 2  Intermittent Fasting improves morning fasted glucose levels and decreases postprandial variability. The daily means for fasting morning glucose 
levels (from personal glucometers) on days 1 through 42 are shown in Figure 2A, with the three phases indicated. Means were calculated from pooled SMBG data 
from the nine individuals that provided complete log sets. Figure 2B represents the daily variance from the mean for fasting morning SMBG, days 1-42, using the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. Figure 2C shows the daily variance from the mean for evening postprandial SMBG values on days 1-42. Inflection points of quadratic

DISCUSSION
Key findings 
Many individuals with T2DM would benefit from a simple 
and accessible nutrition intervention that is simple to 
implement and teach, and improves their glycemic con­
trol. T
eaching diabetes patients about IF only required 
between 15­30 min of the study coordinator’s time, 
hence it was easy to teach. Although short term (2 wk 
IF intervention), and without oversight (self­reported 
and self­controlled eating hours), the intervention 
resulted in significant improvements in diabetic glucose 
control. The IF phase yielded a significant increase in 
the incidence of fasting blood sugars at target (34.1% 
vs 13.4% baseline), and favorable decreases in 
postprandial hyperglycemia (39.4% vs 47.4% baseline). 
There was also a spontaneous 18% decrease in caloric 
intake and increase in energy expenditure (+1856 kcal/
wk), coinciding with a significant decrease in weight 
(P < 0.009) and BMI (P = 0.01). A strong association 
between the increase in hours fasted from baseline, and 
the probability of attaining a normal fasting glucose level 
was found (+LR 8.36), despite few individuals reaching 
the 18­20 h fasting goal. We did not find statistically 
significant changes to blood pressure, insulin resistance 
or inflammatory markers after 2 wk of IF
, although all 
trended towards normal during this phase. Importantly, 
the diet was found to be tolerable and safe, with zero 
incidences of hypoglycemia. 
Upon a return to normal eating habits, the improve­
ments to fasting glucose levels reversed to baseline, a 
trend also seen for the non­significant improvements 
in CRP
, HOMA­IR and BP
. The sample size of this study 
is too small to determine if the sustained decreases in 
waist circumference, postprandial glucose variability, and 
energy intake into the follow­up period are meaningful. 
Comparison to other dietary outcomes
The most similar study to ours that we could identify in 
the literature evaluated IF was a 3 mo crossover study 
in T2DM patients
[32]. These studies differed with respect 
to when participants were instructed to undergo the 
prolonged fasting period (participants in our study were 
allowed to self­select their fasting period, and chose 
late afternoon to early evening). Similar trends were 
observed with respect to weight loss and decreased 
waist circumference, whereas the study by Kahleova et 
al
[32] also showed significant improvements in fasting 
insulin (and presumably insulin resistance), which 
our did not. In contrast, other studies in non­diabetic, 
normal­weight participants, have shown that IF resulted 
in increased insulin resistance, fasting glucose, and 
lipids, despite weight loss occurring
[26,27]. These different 
observed effects between diabetic and non­diabetic 
individuals to similar dietary changes may be related 
to the differences in body weight and hyperglycemia 
Figure 3  Positive relationship between hours 
fasted and morning glucose levels. Ordinal logistic 
regression (OLR) tested the association between 
the increase in hours fasted from baseline, and the 
morning fasting glucose levels within the four glucose 
ranges noted. OLR was performed using data from the 
8 individuals who had completed both their full SMBG 
logs and daily hours fasted logs. OLR models used the 
non-equalized data. Hours Fasted Difference (HFD) 
was calculated for baseline and intervention phases 
only. SMBG: Self-monitored blood glucose.

between the studies, or due to as yet unknown factors.
This work demonstrates that there is a correlation 
between hours fasted and improvements in fasted 
glucose levels, leading us to question if simply skipping 
breakfast (and thereby prolonging the fast) would 
improve T2DM control. A study by Thomas et al
[33] 
tested the effects of skipping breakfast in obese women 
(without diabetes). They found that when regular 
breakfast eaters skipped breakfast, they had greater 
insulin and free fatty acid excursions in response to 
lunch as opposed to days when both breakfast and 
lunch were eaten
[33]. In contrast, those who regularly 
skipped breakfast did not experience irregular responses 
at lunch, regardless of whether breakfast was eaten 
or not
[33]. Clearly, extended fasting will not benefit all 
and has the potential to worsen measures of health if 
applied to patients with T2DM.
We also query if the observed benefits in this study 
arise from altering the normal eating rhythm, rather 
than inducing a net negative energy state (such as 
during fasting, or exercise). Although some evidence 
from animal studies suggest that biological clocks may 
be altered as a result of changes in feeding habits
[34,35], 
evidence of the effects of feeding entrainment on 
glycemic excursions in humans are lacking. 
Strengths and weaknesses of study
Our study involved ten individuals (9 female, one male) 
who present with the typical characteristics of the 
majority of the worlds’ T2DM population; middle age, 
overweight, with insulin resistance and average fasting 
blood sugars above goal. There are several unique 
aspects to this study that provide useful information, not 
the least of which was the patient­controlled meal timing 
and content, all without caloric restriction. It is the 
first study designed with patients directly transitioning 
from their normal dietary habits, to an IF intervention, 
to a follow­up period to see if any of the effects were 
sustained. Also, the capturing of SMBG readings along 
with the actual total hours fasted allowed us to make 
inferences on this relationship, which has not been done 
before. Another strength is our use of the RFPM, which 
has been shown to have good validity
[19,20]. Adherence 
with the study protocol, as reflected by SMBG and the 
recorded hours fasted, was high. Also, as a surrogate 
for tolerability of the IF intervention, 7/10 participants 
viewed the intervention as tolerable when asked, and 
6/10 stating they would consider continuing a modified 
form of IF
. 
The greatest weakness was the lack of power 
from low recruitment, which was the limiting factor in 
determining clear effects of IF on markers of health 
in T2DM, or the detection of sustained effects during 
follow­up. An uneven distribution between females 
(n = 9) and males (n = 1) is also a limiting factor for 
generalizability. Also of importance to note was the 
failure to reach the goal of 18­20 h of fasting per day, 
as these longer fasting times may have accentuated 
health benefits more clearly. Ultimately, the 16.8 ± 
1.2 h fasting during Phase 2 of the study is perhaps a 
true reflection of the feasibility of fasting times for this 
diet in free­living adults. Further a longer duration of 
the study phases would have allowed for comparative 
HbA1c measures to be done, a widely accepted marker 
of average changes to overall glucose control reflecting 
the previous three months. Lastly, it is possible that 
all of the SMBG testing that patients did may have in 
itself led to behavior changes that affected the overall 
recorded glucose levels. Any information learned from 
this observational pilot study can be used to inform a 
larger
, longer
, observational or interventional trial. 
Future directions and developments
Our understanding of the association between feeding 
entrainment and diurnal rhythms is limited, and requires 
further study. Also, our study took blood draws from 
patients at specific time points, for study ease. Ideally, 
patients would have blood draws performed regular 
over a 24 h period so that fluctuations could be noted 
that may be due to diurnal variations, as the consump­
tion of calories changes over the IF period. Since our 
participants only had blood draws performed in the 
morning, some biochemical changes that may have 
occurred during other time periods would have been 
missed. It would also be ideal for future studies to have 
a longer study period which would allow for significant 
weight loss to occur
, and then see if any biochemical 
changes are sustained during an extended follow­up 
period. Of course, a larger sample size would allow for 
a more robust conclusion as to the association between 
SMBG and IF and would shed som light on the true 
effects on morning, afternoon and evening SMBG results.

COMMENTS
Background
Intermittent fasting (IF) is an increasingly popularized dietary method amongst 
varying population groups. The reasons for its increasing popularity are multi-
factorial, but one of which is for weight loss. Although research has been 
performed evaluating an IF intervention in animals and healthy subjects, there 
is very little known about its effects, beneficial or otherwise, in those with type 2 
diabetes. 
Research frontiers
As the prevalence of diabetes continues to increase, new dietary measures are 
necessary to pursue, as one size does not fit all. It is possible that IF may be 
a good option for people with diabetes alongside other popularized diets such 
as the Mediterranean diet, the DASH diet, and the Newcastle diet. With type

2 diabetes affecting so many people worldwide, any new potential treatment 
options are welcome. 
Innovations and breakthroughs
To our knowledge, there is only one other study examining IF in type 2 diabetes 
(Kahleova et al). The study varied in that patients were allowed to self-select 
their meal times and meal options. Further, the study showed that when 
practiced with self-selected meal times and meal options, there is a spontaneous 
reduction in caloric intake (whereas the study by Kahleova provided meals and 
all patients were assigned to a caloric deficit). Further, the participants chose 
to fast mostly in the mornings and leave their meals to nighttime, whereas the 
study by Kahleova had their participants eat only in the morning and afternoon, 
and fasted in the evenings). All told, there is very little literature examining IF in 
diabetes patients, and so all information can be seen as important and innovative 
in their approach to the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 
Applications
Managing the dietary aspect of diabetes can be very difficult and tiresome for 
some people. It can often create unnecessary stress and sense of failure in 
those who are unable or unwilling to adhere to dietary recommendations to 
help control their blood glucose and body weight. IF is a potential alternative 
for certain people who wish to consume their caloric intake for the day in a 
manner which is not considered “recommended” for people with diabetes. It also 
may lead to some weight loss through less caloric consumption, which is often 
welcome for many people with type 2 diabetes. 
Terminology
IF: An eating pattern that time-restricts feeding to 4-6 h and extends the 
overnight fast from 12 h towards 18 or 20 h.
Peer-review
The study is valuable and of interest as intermittent fasting is a hot topic 
regarding weight loss and related benefits including treatment of diabetes.
