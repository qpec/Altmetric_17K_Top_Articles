Dietary modulation of the gut microbiota impacts human health. Here we investigated the hitherto 
unknown effects of resistant starch type 4 (RS4) enriched diet on gut microbiota composition and 
short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations in parallel with host immunometabolic functions in twenty 
individuals with signs of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Cholesterols, fasting glucose, glycosylated 
haemoglobin, and proinflammatory markers in the blood as well as waist circumference and % body 
fat were lower post intervention in the RS4 group compared with the control group. 16S-rRNA gene 
sequencing revealed a differential abundance of 71 bacterial operational taxonomic units, including 
the enrichment of three Bacteroides species and one each of Parabacteroides, Oscillospira, Blautia, 
Ruminococcus, Eubacterium, and Christensenella species in the RS4 group. Gas chromatography–mass 
spectrometry revealed higher faecal SCFAs, including butyrate, propionate, valerate, isovalerate, and 
hexanoate after RS4-intake. Bivariate analyses showed RS4-specific associations of the gut microbiota 
with the host metabolic functions and SCFA levels. Here we show that dietary RS4 induced changes in 
the gut microbiota are linked to its biological activity in individuals with signs of MetS. These findings 
have potential implications for dietary guidelines in metabolic health management.
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) encompasses co-morbidities like obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, insulin 
resistance, and hyperglycaemia, which increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases1, the leading cause of death 
in the US2. Although it is possible to manage these co-morbidities with dietary/lifestyle changes and/or ther-
apeutic interventions, the overall prevalence of MetS is rising worldwide2,3. One contributing factor could be 
non-adherence to healthy dietary practices beyond the short term, as convenience and taste remain the strongest 
determinants of food choices4,5. In that context, our recent double-blind study allowed participants to maintain 
their habitual dietary practices during the intervention without adapting to any change6. This was possible due 
to the neutral and adaptable organoleptic properties of the resistant starch (RS) type 4 (RS4), a wheat-derived 
food-ingredient, used for the intervention.
Different chemical properties contribute to the functional differences between five RS types, particularly in 
terms of fermentability and its influence on the microbiota in the gut7–8. Fermentable carbohydrates such as RS4, 
may potentially increase colonic short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production9. However, there remains a dearth of 
well-controlled holistic intervention studies that have comprehensively examined the influence of RS4 on host 
physiological, gut microbiome, and SCFA changes10–12. One study reported influence of RS4 in healthy indi-
viduals, unrelated to any metabolic condition8. Other published studies regarding metabolic health benefits of 
RS4 involved animal models13–15. However, due to various metabolic adaptations in MetS patients, they may not 
always benefit from the information generated in healthy humans or animal models16. Taken together, there is 
a critical need for well-designed studies in individuals with MetS that systematically connects the influence of a 
functional and adaptable food ingredient on the gut microbial community, bacterial metabolites, and host met-
abolic functions.

In our trial, the RS4-group had improved lipid profiles and body composition6. Since RS4 is indigestible, we 
hypothesized that the health benefits of RS4 are derived from its ability to influence the gut microbial community 
structure, which may, in turn, be linked to altered bacterial fermentation and SCFA production17. Therefore, 
here, in twenty selected participants with MetS, we retrospectively examined the changes in the microbiota 
composition and the SCFA production in the gut, measured the concentrations of three circulatory adipocy-
tokine markers, and estimated the macronutrient and caloric intake during the intervention period. Also, the 
host anthropometric and metabolic parameters were reanalysed in this cohort to show microbe-microbe and 
host-microbe interactions.
Materials and Methods
Detailed information on methods is provided as supplementary information.
General study considerations and diet analysis. 
This investigation involved 20 selected participants 
(Fig. 1) from the parent placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover, dietary intervention study6 (registered at 
clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01887964). The study duration was 26 weeks that included two 12-week interventions 
periods, with one each for RS4 (30%, v/v in flour) and control flour (CF), and a two-week washout in between 
the interventions. The participants from two North American Hutterite (Caucasian) communities were screened 
for MetS using the International Diabetes Federation criteria18. All procedures were conducted with the approval 
(1112012-CR) of the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects Research of South Dakota State University 
and are in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants 
before enrolment into the study. Diet information was collected using a self-administered semi-quantitative 
food frequency questionnaire and was analysed using Nutritionist Pro (Axxya Systems, Redmond, WA, USA). 
Anthropometric, blood lipids, glycaemic parameters, and blood pressure measurement data were obtained from 
the parent study and reanalysed in this sub-cohort6.
Measurement of adipocytokine markers in blood. 
Serum interleukin-6 (IL6) and tumour necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNFα 
) were determined in pico-gram/mL using Human ELISA Ready-SET-Go kits (eBiosci-
ence, San Diego, CA), and plasma adiponectin concentrations were measured in micro-gram/mL using Human 
Adiponectin Radioimmunoassay (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO, following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Gut microbial community structure analysis. 
Stool DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Stool 
Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) and outsourced to Second Genome (South San Francisco, CA) for 16S rRNA 
(V4 hypervariable region) gene sequencing using MiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Taxa were fil-
tered to those present in at least one of the samples to calculate relative abundance of a taxon within each sample. 
Differential abundance between the samples was calculated based on per million sequences in that sample. For 
unidentified Greengenes operational taxonomic units (OTUs), closest hits from NCBI 16S rRNA database were 
cross referenced with > 
90% query cover, > 
87% identity, and < 
0.001 E-value. Raw sequences are currently being 
deposited in NCBI sequence read archive (SRA, accession number SRP035338), belonging to BioProject accession 
 
number PRJNA308315.

Faecal SCFA analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). 
SCFAs were deri-
vatized to their corresponding butyl esters (SCFABE) followed by GC-MS analyses using a GC-MS 5977A and 
HP-5MS UI capillary column from the same manufacturer (Agilent, Wilmington, DE, USA). The data were 
expressed in mg/gm of faecal sample.
Statistical analyses. 
Data were analysed comparing end-points for outcome variables in CF and RS4 
groups, or pre- and post-intervention measures. Linear mixed effects models (SAS MIXED procedure) were 
used to compare the effects of RS4 and CF on physiologic parameters as in our previous report6. All models 
included variables for colony and season, where colony was a surrogate for randomization sequence and season 
was a surrogate for crossover treatment period. General linear mixed models were also used to compare the 
effects of RS4 and CF on microbial abundance using R software package19. To correct for multiple comparisons, 
a false discovery rate (FDR or Benjamini Hochberg method) correction was used to adjust p values (adjusted p 
is represented as q). For pre- and post-intervention comparisons paired t-test (Wilcoxon signed-rank test for 
non-normal data) was used, while student’s t-test (Mann-Whitney signed-rank test for non-normal data) was 
used to compare two different diet groups. Where necessary, data were logarithmically transformed to achieve 
normality. Intra-relationships among parameters or bacterial species, and inter-relationships between parameters 
and microbiota were carried out using Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient (r). Correlation matrices and heat 
maps were generated using various R-packages. The data were presented as means ± 
 S.E.M, unless otherwise 
noted. A p value of 0.05 or less was considered significant, while p value of 0.05 to 0.09 was considered trend or 
approaching significance.
Results
Baseline physiologic, metabolic, and microbiome characteristics of the study participants. 
All 
twenty participants who had signs of metabolic syndrome at baseline and submitted adequate stool samples at 
four data collection time points were included in the current investigation (Fig. 1), which allowed for comparison 
of the gut microbial and SCFA profiles before and after the interventions and also between the endpoints of the 
RS4 and CF (control) interventions. Potential adverse gastrointestinal side effects from the interventions were not 
evaluated in this cohort since none were observed in the parent cohort6. Baseline characteristics of 20 participants 
are summarized in supplementary Table S1. Taxonomic classification of a total of 55,079 sequences (present 
in at least one of the samples) were sorted into 5,949 OTUs, of which ~78% were associated with the phylum 
Firmicutes and ~9% with the phylum Bacteroidetes (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Washout was effective in restoring microbiome characteristics. 
Before switching the RS4 and CF 
diets in the cross-over study design, all the participants were supplied with CF during the 2-week washout period 
in order to avoid the potential carry-over effects of the RS4 intervention. For endpoint comparison between the 
RS4 and CF groups, it was necessary to check for a consistent baseline prior to each treatment period. Using per-
mutational multivariate analysis of variance for distance matrices, no significant differences were observed among 
the starting microbiomes of the RS4 and CF groups (data not shown), which also confirmed that the two-week 
washout was effective and that any differences observed post-intervention are due to the intervention itself.
Macronutrient intake pattern did not vary during the study. 
Variation in macronutrient intake and 
total calories consumed can potentially influence the gut microbiota20, thereby confounding the effects of the 
intervention. Although a large number of food options are offered at each meal, Hutterites have relatively small 
interpersonal differences in diet due to common meal planning, kitchen, and dining practices. No significant dif-
ferences in overall macronutrients and caloric intake were observed between the baseline and post-intervention 
time periods, with the exception of dietary fibre (Table 1). Dietary fibre intake, analysed separately from total 
carbohydrate intake, was significantly higher in the RS4 group (p < 
 0.001), due to RS4 being classified as a preb-
iotic dietary fibre (Table 1). The average calories (~1,774 Kilocalories) consumed at baseline were estimated to 
come from carbohydrate (~49%), protein (~17%), and fat (~34%). These values fall within the Dietary Reference 
Intakes (DRI) for macronutrients, which are 45–65%, 10–35%, and 20–35% for carbohydrate, protein, and fat,

intakes were higher, while daily fibre intake was lower (18 g at baseline, DRI 20–30 g) than recommended in the

Differential post-intervention effects of the RS4 diet compared with the CF diet on the gut 
microbiota. 
The current understanding is that, in studies without a proper control group, inter-individual 
variation in gut microbial composition in adults frequently offsets the smaller changes induced by dietary inter-
ventions10. To address this problem, we compared microbial composition and abundance post RS4 compared 
with post CF intervention. Three taxa, all unclassified species of Firmicutes, differentially shifted between CF and 
RS4 treatments in eight male participants. Similarly, a differential effect of RS4 was observed in 16 Firmicutes 
taxa, with the most numerous genus being Enterococcus, which was significantly enriched after CF intake in 12 
female participants (data not shown). No distinct trend for Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio was observed in male 
or female participants (data not shown). The dominance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was consistent with pre-
vious results, as reported in Hutterite22 and other populations23. The Shannon diversity index was not associated 
with the age of the participants (r = 
 − 
0.2, p > 
 0.05, data not shown). Likewise, the total diversity of the microbiota 
assessed from the Shannon diversity index did not significantly change after either CF or RS4 interventions (data 
not shown).
Principal coordinate analysis showed 26% and 13% variations on axes 1 and 2, respectively, indicating a major 
shift between the two groups (p = 
 0.01, Fig. 2). The RS4 diet differentially modified 71 microbial OTUs (q < 
 0.05), 
including enrichment of four each of Ruminococcus and Blautia, two each of Bacteroides and Oscillospira, and one 
Parabacteroides OTUs (Supplementary Table S2). Of the 71 OTUs, 65 belonged to the phylum Firmicutes. The 
three Bacteroidetes OTUs all increased in abundance with RS4 relative to the CF treatment, while OTUs belong-
ing to Firmicutes had a mixed response (Supplementary Table S2). At the species level, some species were signif-
icantly enriched in the RS4 group, including three Bacteroides species (> 
121.2 fold, q < 
 0.05) along with Blautia 
glucerasea (2497.1 fold, q < 0.001), Christensenella minuta (2.4 × 106 fold, q < 0.001), Eubacterium oxidoreducens 
 
(7723.2 fold, q < 
 0.01), Oscillospira spp. (2528.4 fold, q < 
 0.01), Ruminococcus lactaris (1.2 × 
 105 fold, q < 
 0.001), 
and Parabacteroides distasonis (8642.2 fold, q < 
 0.001), while some were significantly decreased in abundance in 
this group, including pathogenic Enterococcus casseliflavus (− 
13603.2 fold, q < 0.001) and Streptococcus cristatus 
 
(− 
229.7 fold, q < 
 0.05) (Fig. 3a). Although the enrichment fold changes for some of the bacterial species appear 
very high, their relative abundance in the whole microbial community could be low. This is due to the com-
monly used sampling normalization approach based on per million sequences to remove any bias due to varying 
sequencing depth (details in Methods). Overall, trends showed that Bacteroidetes OTUs were increased in the 
RS4 group, leading to an overall lowering of the average Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes (F:B) ratio in the RS4 group 
from 14.6 at baseline to 12.9, but increasing to 19.2 post CF diet (Fig. 3b). The lower F:B ratio is frequently per-
ceived as an indicator of a leaner phenotype, although the previously reported results are not always consistent24. 
Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are two major phyla and the species composition within each may vary widely in a 
given subject. It is possible that both phyla include species that may be characteristic of a particular phenotype. 
Therefore, a species level composition may represent a body weight phenotype more precisely than a broad esti-
mation of F:B ratio.
Impact of RS4 on gut microbiota composition compared before and after RS4 intervention. 
 
Firmicutes species from Clostridium cluster XIVa account for almost 60% of the mucin-adhered microbiota25. 
A general observation was that species from Clostridial cluster XIVa, but not cluster IV, were enriched by RS4 sup-
plementation of the diet. At the species level (Fig. 3c), RS4 consumption increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium 
adolescentis (90.5 fold, q = 
 0.087) and Parabacteroides distasonis (1180.2 fold, q < 
 0.001) but not Ruminococcus

in Christensenella minuta abundance (119.7 fold, q = 
 0.038, 97% query coverage, 88% identity and E < 
 0.001 in 
NCBI-BLAST) as well as in several OTUs in the family Ruminococcaceae and genus Bacteroides. At the spe-
cies level, Bacteroides ovatus (37.6 fold, q =

oxidoreducens (3.3 × 105 fold, q < 0.001), Bacteroides xylanisolvens (47.8 fold, q = 0.037), and Bacteroides acidifa-
ciens (92.4 fold, q = 0.038) were enriched after RS4 intervention.
RS4 consumption altered faecal SCFAs linked to specific gut microbes. 
Acetate was the most abun-
dant SCFA, accounting for over 60% of total SCFAs before and after the interventions in both RS4 and CF groups. 
The individual proportions of the SCFAs, butyric (69.5%, p = 
 0.03), propionic (50.2%), valeric (44.1%), isovaleric 
(20.3%), and hexanoic (19.2%) acids increased post intervention from baseline in the RS4 group (p < 
 0.05, Fig. 4a 
and Supplementary Fig. S2) but not in the CF group (data not shown). A 24.6% decrease in isobutyric acid in 
the RS4 group was observed. A Pearson correlation analysis showed a potential link between significant changes 
in the gut microbiota composition induced by RS4 and altered SCFA levels (Fig. 4b). Acetate and butyrate lev-
els were correlated (p < 
 0.05) with Ruminococcus lactaris (r = 
 0.54) and Oscillospira spp. (r = 
 0.41). Total SCFAs 
were correlated with the abundance of two species: Methanobrevibacter spp. (r = 0.43) and Ruminococcus lactaris 
 
(r = 
 0.52). Propionate and isobutyrate levels were linked to Methanobrevibacter spp. (r = 
 0.65 and r = 
 0.79,

respectively), Eubacterium dolichum (r = 
 0.42 and r = 
 0.43, respectively), Christensenella minuta (r = 
 0.39 and 
r = 
 0.59, respectively), and Ruminococcus lactaris (r = 
 0.59 and r = 
 0.40, respectively), of which the latter two were 
increased by RS4 (Figs 3a,c and 4b). Interestingly, these associations of SCFAs with specific gut microbiota were 
not observed after CF intervention (data not shown). To our knowledge, prior studies with RS4 have not reported 
significant SCFA changes in human faecal samples.
Impact of RS4 intervention on circulatory adipocytokines. 
In obesity, macrophages infiltrate adipose 
tissue and secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as IL6 and TNFα 
26. Also, adiponectin is released by adipocytes 
in the blood and has important roles in lipid and glucose metabolism27. Reduced adiponectin levels are associ-
ated with various aspects of metabolic dysfunction28. Compared with baseline, IL6 decreased by 38% (p = 
 0.04), 
and adiponectin levels increased by 20% (p = 
 0.002) in the RS4 group, while TNFα 
 did not change significantly. 
Both TNFα 
 and adiponectin concentrations were lower post RS4 diet compared with post CF diet (p = 0.08 and 
p = 
 0.02 respectively, Table 2). To our knowledge, this is the first report showing changes in adipocytokines, which 
help determine progression to cardiovascular aberrancies28,29, in response to RS4 intake in humans.
Impact of RS4 consumption on body composition, lipids, and glucose metabolism. 
Individuals 
had lower % body fat (p = 
 0.05) and lower non-high density lipoprotein (non-HDL, p = 0.003), HDL (p = 0.005), 
and total cholesterol (TC, p < 
 0.001) post RS4 consumption compared with post CF consumption (Table 1). A 
trend was observed for lower waist circumference (p = 
 0.06), glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C, p = 
 0.08), and 
fasting blood glucose (p = 
 0.09) following RS4 consumption compared with CF consumption. It is likely that 
response variation among participants to an RS4 diet contributed to these higher p-values. Varying responses to 
dietary interventions among individuals are frequently reported30. Changes in fasting glucose and HbA1C were 
more pronounced in this cohort (− 
8.6% and − 
1%, respectively) compared with the parent cohort (− 
4.2% and 
no decrease, respectively). Attenuation of % body fat combined with a smaller waist circumference indicates a 
potential reduction in central obesity in these individuals. Although significant, these changes were modest, as 
measures of body composition do not change rapidly in adults and can take several months to years to show a 
larger change. Waist circumference, TC, HDL, and non-HDL were also reduced in the RS4 group compared with 
baseline (all, p < 
 0.05). No significant effects of RS4 were observed on blood pressure or triglyceride levels in

either group (Table 2). The average lipid and glycaemic profiles were apparently within normal limits, likely due 
to prescribed medication usage for various metabolic dysfunctions (Table 2).
Inter-associations between gut bacteria and metabolic functions. 
Multiple novel gut microbial 
associations with metabolic functions were observed post intervention in the RS4 group compared with the CF 
group (Fig. 5). We propose that the associations detected post RS4 diet, but not post CF diet, could be induced by 
RS4. However, several associations were common to both groups, lacking specific response to RS4 enrichment. 
RS4-specific inverse correlations were observed between TC and the abundances of Bacteroides plebeius (r = 
 − 
0.46), 
 
Blautia producta (r = 
 − 
0.49), and Prevotella stercorea (r = 
 − 
0.45; all, p < 
 0.05). Although the abundances of 
Parabacteroides distasonis and Oscillospira spp. were enriched post RS4 compared with post CF intervention, 
their negative association with TC, low density lipoprotein (LDL), and non-HDL were not RS4-specific (all, 
p < 
 0.05). In another instance, while RS4 did not significantly alter the abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, 
an RS4-specific negative correlations between this species and body mass index (BMI, r = − 
0.45) and % body fat 
(r = 
 − 
0.56) were observed (all, p < 
 0.05). An RS4-specific correlation between adiponectin and Bacteroides ovatus 
(r = 
 0.79, p < 
 0.01), Bacteroides uniformis (r = 
 0.56, p < 
 0.05), and Bacteroides acidifaciens (r = 
 0.82, p < 
 0.001) was 
observed (Fig. 5). RS4 intake did not significantly enrich Methanobrevibacter spp. and Eubacterium dolichum, but 
these bacteria were correlated with weight and BMI (Fig. 5) as well as with SCFA levels (Fig. 3b) in an RS4-specific man-
ner. Methanobrevibacter spp. (r = 
 − 
0.45), Ruminococcus gnavus (r = 
 − 
0.56), and Prevotella stercorea (r = 
 − 
0.45) 
 
were negatively correlated with LDL (p < 
 0.05), while Blautia producta (r = 
 − 
0.44) and Prevotella stercorea (r = 
 − 
0.50) 
 
were negatively associated with TC and non-HDL (all, p < 0.05) in an RS4-specific way.
Intra-association within gut microbes. 
Little is known about how the relative abundance of one micro-
bial species may influence the presence of another species within the gut ecosystem, particularly in response to 
RS4 consumption. To evaluate this question, we examined intra-association and clustering among those bac-
teria that showed RS4-specific association with SCFAs and metabolic features. Three Bacteroides species that 
showed a positive correlation with adiponectin and Prevotella stercorea, which associated with TC, LDL, and 
non-HDL, were clustered together (Figs 5 and 6). In general, a higher association within Bacteroidetes species 
or within Firmicutes species was observed, although there were exceptions. One example is Bacteroides plebius, 
which correlated with the Firmicutes member Blautia producta (r = 
 0.98, p = 
 < 
0.001), and both of these were 
negatively linked to RS4-induced changes in TC or non-HDL. Christensenella minuta tended to associate with 
Ruminococcus lactaris (r = 
 0.58, p = 
 0.02), and both were enriched after RS4 intervention. Both Christensenella 
minuta and Ruminococcus lactaris also clustered with Methanobrevibacter spp. and Eubacterium dolichum (both, 
p < 0.05), but not with Ruminococcus torques and Oscillospira spp., although all of them were associated with one 
or more SCFAs (Figs 4b and 6).
Association among metabolic features. 
Variation in response to RS4 among participants was 
observed, and the pattern is similar for various host metabolism parameters (response variation data not 
shown). This pattern may be due to the known link between high levels of circulating lipids and glucose with

lower blood adiponectin levels31 and the correlation of up-regulated IL6 and tissue necrotic factor-α 
 with the 
pro-inflammatory state in obesity32. The clustering of metabolic dysfunctions and CVD risk factors in adults 
has been observed in epidemiological studies and in the clinical setting33. In line with that, we observed con-
sistent intra-associations among parameters of metabolic dysfunction within our data set independent of die-
tary changes (Supplementary Fig. S3). TC and non-HDL, but not HDL, correlated more closely with each other 
(r = 
 0.95, p < 
 0.001). Similar correlations were observed among various anthropometric measures, such as weight, 
BMI, and waist circumference, as well as fasting glucose (p < 
 0.05). Fasting glucose correlated with IL6 level 
(r = 0.51, p = 0.07), which in turn was associated with diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.78, p < 
 0.01), systolic blood 
pressure (r = 
 0.52, p = 
 0.07), and waist circumference (r = 
 0.60, p = 
 0.03). Triglyceride concentrations were pos-
itively associated with weight (r = 
 0.82, p < 
 0.001), waist circumference (r = 
 0.60, p = 
 0.03), and BMI (r = 
 0.64, 
p = 
 0.02), while negatively correlated with HDL (r = 
 − 
0.65, p = 
 0.02) and adiponectin (r = 
 − 
0.45, p = 
 0.12) but 
had little apparent link with TC and LDL.
Discussion
Our present study provides for the first time a microbiome signature in response to RS4 consumption in subjects 
with MetS. Among the comorbidities of MetS, numerous studies associated a dysbiosis with obesity and type 
2 diabetes34, but less is known about the role of the microbiota-diet interactions in hypercholesterolemia35. A 
handful of in vitro, animal, and healthy volunteer studies suggested that the microbiota affects lipid metabo-
lism36–38, but a clear understanding is lacking. Reduction in plasma TC and non-HDL and HDL cholesterol after 
RS4 consumption was consistently observed in the larger parent cohort6 as well as in the present sub-cohort 
when compared with the control group and with baseline. In addition, a novel link between TC and non-HDL 
with three bacterial species was observed in an RS4-specific manner. The effect of an RS4 diet on Parabacteroides 
distasonis without any context of lipid metabolism was previously reported8 and further confirmed by our 
results. Parabacteroides distasonis was augmented post-RS4 compared with the post-CF and baseline. This spe-
cies showed a correlation with TC and non-HDL in both intervention groups and clustered with species belong-
ing to both the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla. While RS4 also lowered HDL, such a reduction is not always 
associated with increased cardio-vascular disease risk, while lowering of TC and non-HDL, which includes 
 
LDL, remains critical39.
Another novel RS4-induced microbial enrichment involved Christensenella minuta in the family 
Christensenellaceae, which was identified in human faeces only recently40. This species was reported as being 
heritable, based on host genetics, and abundant in healthy, lower-BMI individuals, and its addition reduced 
microbiome-mediated weight gain in germ-free mice41. Christensenella minuta was enriched post RS4-diet 
compared with post CF-diet and the baseline, and correlated in an RS4-specific manner with higher propi-
onate, isobutyrate, valerate, and isovalerate concentrations, similar to that of Methanobrevibacter spp. in the

Methanobacteriaceae family. This result is in line with a previous report that this bacterium co-occurs with 
Methanobacteriaceaea members, and both together produce SCFAs41. Moreover, Christensenella minuta 
was reported to augment Oscillospira, a bacterium that was enriched and associated with higher isovarelate 
levels post-RS4 but not post-CF. However, contrary to a prior suggestion41, our results present evidence that 
Christensenella minuta is amenable to dietary intervention. We also observed a positive correlation of this species 
with weight and BMI, which was, however, non-specific to RS4 intervention. Future investigations may address 
whether Christensenella minuta-mediated energy harvest from SCFAs is utilized differently by individuals with 
MetS than by the lean and healthy individuals involved in prior studies40,41.
Complex carbohydrate or glycan availability is a major factor in shaping the gut microflora42. Since many of 
the starch-degrading enzymes are represented as a starch-utilization system (SUS) in ~20% of the genome of 
Bacteroidetes species42–44, enrichment of Bacteroides ovatus and Parabacteroides distasonis after RS4 interven-
tion in this study was as expected. Further confirmation with Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database 
(http://www.cazy.org/)45 supported that Bacteroidetes species are dominant starch-degrading bacteria after RS4 
intervention.
The strengths of this study include statistically significant observations of prebiotic RS4-induced changes 
across microbial composition, faecal SCFA levels, and host immunometabolic functions, all of which are relevant 
to the underlying physiology of individuals with pre-existing metabolic dysfunctions. Human dietary interven-
tions conducted within natural settings and reporting statistically significant outcomes that are consistent across 
a broad range of metabolic health measures are rare46. One exploratory human intervention study attempted to 
show the prebiotic diet concept for combating obesity by undertaking a similar comprehensive investigation, but 
utilized a parallel design and a different kind of non-RS prebiotic diet. In that study, the changes in the microbiota 
and some metabolites, although not including SCFA, were observed, but without any concomitant improvement 
in metabolic functions47. This difference could be due to RS4 having a different prebiotic impact on such param-
eters or due to the crossover design of our study, which allowed each participant to serve as his/her own control, 
minimizing the influence of confounding variables on treatment effects. In addition, a stringent FDR at 0.05 
helped minimize false positives for gut microbial changes. Furthermore, novel associations among host metabolic 
functions and species-level composition of the gut microbiota were observed, many of which also coincided with 
intra-species clustering, indicating the possibility of a synergistic (within bacterial species) as well as super-system 
interactions (symbiotic host–microbe systems) linked with metabolic functions. However, we note that faecal 
SCFAs represent < 
5% of the total SCFAs that are typically excreted, while the major portion of SCFAs is efficiently 
absorbed in the intestinal lumen36. Also microbial communities in faecal samples may potentially exclude gut 
residents that are not shed. Nevertheless, faecal specimens are the most practical samples obtained from a human 
dietary intervention study for assessing the gut microbiome.
In conclusion, this study provides evidence that dietary RS4 supplementation selectively changes the gut 
microbial and metabolite environment as well as associated host metabolic functions. To our knowledge, this 
is the first holistic study that investigated the effects of the fermentable fibre, RS4, on the gut microbial ecology, 
functional metabolites like SCFAs, and physiological responses in the host in one well-designed study in a free 
living Caucasian cohort with signs of MetS. The findings support the perceived role of the microbiota–host inter-
action in nutritional therapies with important implications for dietary guidelines for individuals with metabolic 
disorders, a major public health concern of the present day.
