IMPORTANCE Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent risk factor for chronic
liver disease and cardiovascular disease.
OBJECTIVE To compare the effects of moderate and vigorous exercise on intrahepatic
triglyceride content and metabolic risk factors among patients with NAFLD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this randomized clinical trial, participants with central
obesity and NAFLD were recruited from community-based screening in Xiamen, China, from
December 1, 2011, through December 25, 2013. Data analysis was performed from August 28,
2015, through December 15, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned to vigorous-moderate exercise
(jogging 150 minutes per week at 65%-80% of maximum heart rate for 6 months and brisk
walking 150 minutes per week at 45%-55% of maximum heart rate for another 6 months),
moderate exercise (brisk walking 150 minutes per week for 12 months), or no exercise.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primaryoutcome,changeinintrahepatictriglyceridecontent
measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 6 and 12 months; secondary out-
comes, changes in body weight, waist circumference, body fat, and metabolic risk factors.
RESULTS A total of 220 individuals (mean [SD] age, 53.9 [7.1] years; 149 woman [67.7%]) were
randomly assigned to control (n = 74), moderate exercise (n = 73), and vigorous-moderate
exercise (n = 73) groups. Of them, 211 (95.9%) completed the 6-month follow-up visit; 208
(94.5%) completed the 12-month follow-up visit. Intrahepatic triglyceride content was reduced
by 5.0% (95% CI, −7.2% to 2.8%; P < .001) in the vigorous-moderate exercise group and 4.2%
(95% CI, −6.3% to −2.0%; P < .001) in the moderate exercise group compared with the control
group at the 6-month assessment. It was reduced by 3.9% (95% CI, −6.0% to −1.7%; P < .001) in
the vigorous-moderate exercise group and 3.5% (95% CI, −5.6% to −1.3%; P = .002) in the mod-
erate exercise group compared with the control group at the 12-month assessment. Changes in
intrahepatic triglyceride content were not significantly different between vigorous-moderate
and moderate exercise at the 6- or 12-month assessment. Body weight, waist circumference,
and blood pressure were significantly reduced in the vigorous-moderate exercise group
compared with the moderate exercise and control groups at the 6-month assessment and in
the vigorous-moderate and moderate exercise groups compared with the control group at the
12-month assessment. In addition, body fat was significantly reduced in the vigorous-moderate
exercise group compared with the moderate exercise and control groups at the 12-month
assessment. After adjusting for weight loss, the net changes in intrahepatic triglyceride content
were diminished and became nonsignificant between the exercise and control groups (except
for the moderate exercise group at the 6-month assessment).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Vigorous and moderate exercise were equally effective in
reducing intrahepatic triglyceride content; the effect appeared to be largely mediated by
weight loss.

N
onalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has reached
epidemic proportions worldwide and is the most com-
mon cause of chronic liver disease.1 The condition af-
fects 20% to 30% of adults in the general population and 70%
to 90% of patients with obesity or diabetes in Western
countries.1,2 In China, approximately 20% of adults in the gen-
eral population have NAFLD.3 Nonalcoholic fatty liver dis-
ease is closely related to insulin resistance and metabolic risk
factors (ie, abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia,
hyperglycemia).4 Furthermore, NAFLD has been associated
with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease independent
of metabolic risk factors.1
A retrospective clinical study5 indicated that vigorous but
not moderate exercise was associated with a lower risk of ste-
atohepatitis and advanced fibrosis in patients with biopsy-
proven NAFLD. Several small clinical trials6-9 reported incon-
sistentfindingsofshort-termexerciseprogramsonintrahepatic
lipids among patients with NAFLD. In addition, these studies
did not provide dose-response information needed to formu-
late evidence-based clinical guidelines for NAFLD manage-
ment. Furthermore, the long-term effect of current physical
activity guidelines on NAFLD is uncertain.10-13
The current study aimed to compare the effects of mod-
erate and vigorous exercise on intrahepatic triglyceride
(IHTG) content and metabolic risk factors among patients
with NAFLD. In addition, we also compared the effects of
transitioning from vigorous to moderate exercise on IHTG
and metabolic risk factors.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
The current study was a randomized, parallel-group,
observer-masked clinical trial designed to compare the
effects of vigorous and moderate exercise with control on
IHTG content, body fat, and metabolic risk factors among
patients with NAFLD. The study protocol can be found in
Supplement 1. Eligible trial participants were randomly
assigned to vigorous-moderate exercise, moderate exercise,
or control groups for 12 months with an allocation ratio of
1:1:1. The randomization schedules were generated using SAS
PROC PLAN in SAS statistical software (SAS Institute Inc) and
concealed until an eligible participant was ready for enroll-
ment. Patient recruitment and intervention were conducted
from December 1, 2011, through December 25, 2013, in Xia-
men, China. Data analysis was performed from August 28,
2015, through December 15, 2015.
The trial was overseen by a steering committee and an
independent data and safety monitoring board affiliated
with the Xiamen University Institutional Review Board. The
study protocol and informed consent form were approved by
institutional review boards of the First Affiliated Hospital of
Xiamen University in China and Tulane University. All
patients provided written informed consent before enroll-
ment. The trial was not masked, but study staff who col-
lected data on study outcomes were unaware of study group
assignments.
Study Participants
All study participants were recruited from Xiamen City, China,
by community-based screening to identify individuals aged 40
to 65 years with central obesity (waist circumference ≥90 cm
in men and ≥85 cm in women). Individuals with central obe-
sity were invited to attend a screening abdominal ultrasono-
graphic examination at the study clinic. Those who had ultra-
sonography-diagnosed NAFLD were invited to confirm their
diagnosis by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (IHTG
content ≥5%). Individuals were excluded if they consumed
more than a mean of 140 g of ethanol (10 alcoholic drinks) per
week in men and 70 g of ethanol (5 drinks) in women during
the past 6 months. Patients were also excluded if they had a
history of acute or chronic viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver
diseases, or autoimmune hepatitis. In addition, patients were
excluded if they had a history of diabetes, uncontrolled hy-
pertension, chronic kidney disease, hyperthyroidism, myo-
cardial infarction within 6 months, or heart failure (New York
Heart Association class III or IV). Furthermore, patients were
excluded if they were participating in weight loss programs or
had a medical condition that limited their exercise capability.
Intervention Programs
Participants assigned to the vigorous-moderate exercise group
were instructed to participate in a 6-month vigorous exercise
program followed by a 6-month moderate exercise program,
whereas participants assigned to the moderate exercise pro-
gram were instructed to participate in a 12-month moderate
exercise program. Participants in the control group were in-
structed to not change their physical activity routine. All par-
ticipantsattendedgrouphealtheducationsessions,whichwere
held biweekly in the first 6 months and monthly in the last
6 months of the intervention. Education sessions were given
separately for the intervention and control groups. The health
educationcontent(eg,generalhealthknowledgeofNAFLDand
metabolic diseases, smoking cessation, and elements of a
healthy lifestyle) was identical among the randomization
groups, with the exception of a behavioral component on ad-
herence to exercise programs that was conducted only in the
intervention groups. All study participants were instructed to
not change their diet.
Key Points
Question Is vigorous exercise more effective in improving
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease than moderate exercise?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 220 Chinese adults
with abdominal obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,
intrahepatic triglyceride content was significantly reduced by
5.0% in the vigorous exercise group and 4.2% in the moderate
exercise group compared with a control group during 6 months.
The change in intrahepatic triglyceride content was not
significantly different between the vigorous and moderate
exercise groups.
Meaning Vigorous and moderate exercise was equally effective
in reducing intrahepatic triglyceride content among patients with
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

During the vigorous exercise sessions, participants jogged
onatreadmillandgraduallyincreasedexerciseintensitysothat
their heart rate was 65% to 80% of their maximum predicted
heart rate (equivalent to 8.0-10.0 metabolic equivalents). They
were instructed to exercise at this intensity for 30 minutes.
Their heart rates were monitored by a wireless heart rate moni-
tor (BH Fitness). The maximum predicted heart rate was cal-
culated as 220/min (210/min for women) minus the partici-
pant’
s age.14 Participants were required to participate in 5
vigorous exercise sessions each week supervised by a study
physician at a local community health center. After 6 months
of vigorous exercise, participants switched to moderate exer-
cise for another 6 months. In the moderate exercise program,
participants were instructed to briskly walk at approximately
120 steps per minute so that their heart rate was 45% to 55%
of their maximum predicted heart rate (equivalent to 3.0-6.0
metabolic equivalents) for 30 minutes per session and 5 ses-
sions per week. Participants in the moderate exercise pro-
gram were required to wear pedometers (Omron Healthcare)
and record their daily exercise in a log, which was reviewed
weekly by study staff.15 Participants received follow-up tele-
phone calls from study staff twice per week to assess their ad-
herence to the program and provide suggestions for improve-
ment. Before starting the vigorous and moderate exercise
programs, participants were trained for 2 to 4 weeks to achieve
the appropriate exercise intensity.
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome was change in IHTG content from base-
line to 6 and 12 months after the start of the intervention. The
IHTG content was measured using proton magnetic resonance
spectroscopy.16 The secondary outcomes included changes in
body weight, waist circumference, body fat, and metabolic risk
factors. Body fat mass was quantified using a whole-body dual
x-ray system (Hologic Inc). Abdominal visceral fat and subcu-
taneous fat areas were measured by computed tomography
(SiemensMedicalSolutions)atthelevelofthelumbarvertebra.17
Metabolic risk factors and liver enzymes were measured using
standard methods. All study outcomes were measured at base-
line and 6- and 12-follow-up visits.
Nutrient intake was estimated by 3 consecutive 24-hour
dietary recalls (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) at baseline and
6 and 12 months. Nutrient intake was calculated based on the
nutrient content listed in the Chinese Food Composition
Table.18 Physical activity was assessed using the Interna-
tional Physical Activity Questionnaire (long form) at the base-
line examination.19 Furthermore, trial participants were re-
quired to wear a pedometer for 1 week to record their regular
physical activity (excluding exercise intervention programs)
at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.
Statistical Analysis
This trial was designed to provide greater than 90% statisti-
cal power to detect a 1.76% reduction in IHTG content (SD,
2.35%) at a significance level of .008 (.05/6 for the Bonferroni
correction of multiple comparisons) using a 2-tailed test. The
proposed group difference and SD of reduction in IHTG con-
tent were based on data from previous studies.6,20 We also
assumed an 80% follow-up rate.
Data were analyzed according to participants’randomiza-
tion assignments, regardless of their subsequent status (in-
tent to treat). A mixed-effects model was used to assess the
effects of exercise programs on the change in IHTG content,
and an autoregressive correlation matrix was used to correct
within-participant correlation for repeated measurements. In
this model, participants were assumed to be random effects,
and intervention groups, time, and their interaction were as-
sumed to be estimable fixed effects. In addition, we adjusted
for weight loss in a secondary analysis to assess its contribu-
tion to the change in IHTG content associated with exercise.
PROC MIXED of SAS statistical software, version 9.4 (SAS In-
stitute Inc), was used to obtain point estimates and SEs of the
treatment effects and to test for differences between treat-
ments. Multiple imputation for missing data in the multivari-
able analyses was conducted using the Markov chain Monte
Carlo method. P < .008 (.05/6 comparisons) was considered
statistically significant.

Results
A total of 220 individuals who met all eligibility criteria and
were willing to participate in the trial were randomly as-
signed to the control (n = 74), moderate exercise (n = 73), and
vigorous-moderateexercise(n = 73)groups(Figure1).Ofthem,
211 (95.9%) completed the 6-month follow-up visit, and 208
(94.5%) completed the 12-month follow-up visit. Adherence
to the intervention program, defined as participating in 80%
or more of the exercise sessions (a mean of 4 of 5 each week)
was excellent among those who completed follow-up visits.
For example, 67 (98.5%) and 62 (93.9%) individuals partici-
pated in 80% or more of the exercise sessions during the
6-month vigorous-exercise and 12-month moderate-exercise
interventions in the vigorous-moderate exercise group, and 67
(97.1%)and66(95.7%)individualsparticipatedin80%ormore
oftheexercisesessionsduringthe6-monthand12-monthmod-
erate-exercise intervention, respectively.
Mean (SD) age was 53.9 (7.1) years, and 149 participants
(67.7%) were female. Baseline characteristics were balanced
among the 3 groups (Table 1). During the 12-month interven-
tion, dietary intake of energy and macronutrients was not sig-
nificantlydifferentamongthe3groups(eTable1inSupplement
2). Regular physical activity (excluding exercise intervention
programs) was not significantly different among the 3 groups
(eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
Primary Outcomes
Compared with the control group, the IHTG content was re-
duced by 4.2% (95% CI, −6.3% to −2.0%; P < .001) at the
6-month assessment and 3.5% (95% CI, −5.6% to −1.3%;
P = .002) at the 12-month assessment in the moderate exer-
cise intervention (Figure 2). Likewise, the IHTG content was
reducedby5.0%(95%CI,−7.2%to−2.8%;P < .001)at6months
after vigorous exercise and 3.8% (95% CI, −6.0% to −1.7%;
P < .001) at 12 months after moderate exercise in the vigorous-
moderate exercise group compared with the control group
(Figure 2). However, the net change in the IHTG content was
not significantly different between the vigorous-moderate ex-
ercise and moderate exercise groups at the 6-month (−0.8%;
95% CI, −3.0% to 1.4%; P = .45) or 12-month (−0.4%; 95% CI,
−2.6% to 1.8%; P = .74) assessment (Figure 2). Furthermore,
transitioning from vigorous exercise to moderate exercise was
associated with a nonsignificant increase in the IHTG content
(0.7%; 95% CI, −1.0% to 2.5%; P = .41) in the vigorous-
moderate exercise group.
In a secondary analysis adjusting for weight loss, the IHTG
contentwasreducedby3.7%(95%CI,−5.7%to−1.7%;P < .001)
at the 6-month assessment and 2.0% (95% CI, −4.1% to 0.0%;
P = .053) at the 12-month assessment in the moderate exer-
cise intervention compared with the control group (eTable 3
in Supplement 2). Likewise, the IHTG content was reduced by
2.3% (95% CI, −4.4% to −0.1%; P = .04) at 6 months after vig-
orous exercise and 1.9% (95% CI, −4.0% to 0.3%; P = .08) at

12 months after moderate exercise in the vigorous-moderate
exercise group compared with the control group after adjust-
ing for weight loss. The adjusted net change in the IHTG con-
tent between the vigorous-moderate and moderate exercise
groups was −1.4% (95% CI, −0.7% to 3.6%; P = .20) at 6 months
and −0.2% (95% CI, −1.9% to 2.3%; P = .86) at 12 months.
The effect of moderate and vigorous-moderate exercise on
IHTG content was not significantly different by subgroups of
cigarettesmoking,alcoholdrinking,highschooleducation,and
metabolic syndrome at 6 and 12 months (eTable 4 in
Supplement 2).
In a sensitivity analysis using multiple imputed data, net
changes in the IHTG content were significantly reduced by
−4.1% (95% CI, −6.2% to −2.0%; P < .001) and −3.4% (95% CI,
−5.5% to −1.2%; P = .002) in the moderate exercise group and
by −4.8% (95% CI, −6.9% to −2.7%; P < .001) and −3.4% (95%
CI, −5.6% to −1.3%; P < .001) in the vigorous-moderate exer-
cise group at 6-month and 12-month assessments, respec-
tively.Nosignificantdifferenceswerefoundbetweenvigorous-
moderatevsmoderateexercisegroupsat6-month(−0.7%;95%
CI, −2.8% to 1.4%; P = .51) or 12-month (−0.1%; 95 CI, −2.2%
to 2.0%; P = .94) assessments.
Body Weight and Fat
During the 6-month intervention, vigorous exercise signifi-
cantlyreducedweight,waistcircumference,bodyfatmass,and
body fat percentage compared with control and moderate ex-
ercise (Table 2). In addition, vigorous exercise significantly re-
duced visceral fat compared with moderate exercise and sub-
cutaneous fat compared with control. During the 12-month
intervention, both moderate and vigorous-moderate exer-
cise significantly reduced weight and waist circumference.
Moreover, vigorous-moderate exercise significantly reduced
bodyfatmassandpercentagecomparedwithcontrolandmod-
erate exercise and reduced visceral fat compared with mod-
erate exercise.
Metabolic Risk Factors
During the 6-month intervention, vigorous exercise signifi-
cantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure com-
pared with control and moderate exercise (Table 3). During the
12-month intervention, moderate exercise and vigorous-
moderate exercise significantly reduced blood pressure com-
pared with control. Both vigorous and moderate exercise did
not significantly reduce fasting glucose or lipid levels during
the 6-month or 12-month intervention.
Liver Enzymes
Changes in serum alanine transaminase and γ-glutamyl
transferase levels did not significantly differ among the
3 groups during the 6- or 12-month intervention. However,
serum aspartate aminotransferase was significantly
increased in the vigorous exercise group compared with the
moderate exercise group during the 6-month intervention
(Table 3).
Adverse Events
No deaths or serious adverse events were reported through-
out the study. Two participants (1 in the moderate exercise
group and 1 in the vigorous-moderate exercise group)
reported bone fractures, which did not occur during exercise
sessions.
Discussion
This randomized clinical trial contributes novel findings on the
effectsofexerciseonNAFLDinseveralaspects.First,thisstudy
indicated that vigorous exercise at 65% to 80% of the maxi-
mum heart rate and moderate exercise at 45% to 55% of the
maximum heart rate for 150 minutes per week are equally ef-
fective in reducing the IHTG content among patients with cen-

tral obesity and NAFLD. Second, most but not all of the effect
was mediated by weight loss. Third, only vigorous exercise re-
duced weight, waist circumference, body fat, and blood pres-
sure at 6 months compared with control. However, moderate
exercise reduced weight, waist circumference, and blood pres-
sure but not body fat at 12 months compared with control.
Fourth, exercise seems less effective on glucose and lipid re-
duction in this study population. These findings have impor-
tant clinical and public health implications.
Several small clinical trials6-10 assessed the effect of
short-term exercise programs on the IHTG content among
patients with NAFLD. Johnson and colleagues6 reported that
a 4-week supervised, progressive aerobic exercise program
reduced the IHTG content by 21% (P < .05) in 12 sedentary
obese adults compared with 7 no-exercise controls. Sullivan
et al7 found that moderate exercise for 16 weeks resulted in a
10.3% decrease in the IHTG content in 12 obese persons with
NAFLD compared with 6 control patients (P < .05). In addi-
tion, Keating and colleagues8 tested the effects of 3 interven-
tion programs with various levels of intensity and dose of
aerobic exercise on the IHTG content in an 8-week clinical
trial among 48 sedentary overweight or obese adults and
documented that all aerobic exercise regimens reduced liver
fat with no difference by dose or intensity. In contrast,
Shojaee-Moradie et al9 reported no difference in liver fat
during a 6-week exercise program in 10 sedentary over-
weight men compared with 7 controls. However, these small
short-term trials were not able to provide dose-response
information to formulate evidence-based clinical guidelines
regarding exercise programs in patients with NAFLD.
To our knowledge, this study is the first randomized clini-
cal trial to compare the long-term effect of moderate and vig-
orous exercise on NAFLD. This trial indicated that moderate
and vigorous exercise programs have similar effects on liver
fat reduction among obese patients with NAFLD. These re-
sults support the current physical activity guidelines (150 min-
utes of moderate-intensity activity per week) for the manage-
ment of NAFLD.11-13 Because moderate exercise is more
sustainable and provides most of the benefit of vigorous ex-
ercise, it should be recommended for the prevention and treat-
ment of NAFLD.
Weight loss via lifestyle intervention has been docu-
mented to play a role in reducing liver fat, and a weight loss of
5% or more seems to be desirable for improving NAFLD.21 In
this trial, exercise programs resulted in a 3% to 6% weight loss,
whereas they reduced relative liver fat by 35% to 40% among
patients with NAFLD. After adjustment for weight loss, exer-
cise interventions were no longer significantly associated with
IHTG content reduction (except for moderate exercise at
6 months) at a predefined significance level of .008. These

erable uncertainty and debate. Moderate-intensity aerobic ex-
ercise has been documented to induce modest reductions in
weight and waist circumference in overweight and obese
populations.22 However, there is little conclusive evidence for
more favorable effects with high-intensity exercise than with
moderate-intensity exercise on weight loss.23 Jakicic and
colleagues24 compared the effects of different durations and
intensities of exercise on 12-month weight loss in a random-
ized trial of 201 sedentary overweight women. Significant
weight loss was achieved among all exercise groups with no
differences based on exercise durations and intensities. Ross
and colleagues25 also reported no difference in waist circum-
ference reduction according to exercise amount and inten-
sity in a 24-week randomized trial among 217 abdominally
obese adults. Our data indicated that vigorous but not mod-
erate exercise significantly reduced body weight and waist cir-
cumference during the 6-month intervention. However, mod-
erate exercise significantly reduced body weight and waist
circumference during the 12-month intervention. Our study
suggeststhatshort-termvigorousexerciseandlong-termmod-
erate exercise programs could be recommended for weight re-
duction in obese individuals.
In this trial, vigorous but not moderate exercise signifi-
cantly reduced body fat and visceral fat. A meta-analysis26 of
clinical trials suggests that there seems to be a threshold for
exercise intensity to have an effect on the reduction of vis-
ceral fat. Several clinical trials27-29 indicated that vigorous or
moderate to vigorous exercise reduced visceral fat, whereas
another trial26 found that low to moderate exercise did not re-
duce visceral fat. Irving and colleagues30 compared the ef-
fect of low-intensity and high-intensity aerobic exercise with
a no-exercise control on abdominal adiposity among 27 obese
women and reported that only high-intensity exercise re-
duced abdominal fat and visceral fat during a 16-week inter-
vention. Our study is the first large trial, to our knowledge,
to compare the effect of moderate and vigorous exercise on
visceral fat reduction. Our study suggests that vigorous exer-
cise may be required for reducing visceral fat among obese
individuals.
Ourstudyfindingthataerobicexercisereducedbloodpres-
surewasconsistentwithpreviousclinicaltrials.31However,ex-
ercise did not significantly reduce lipid or glucose levels in our
study. Previous clinical trials32,33 also reported inconsistent ef-
fects of aerobic exercise on low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose lev-
els in participants without dietary intervention.
This study has some limitations. First, to test the effect
of transitioning from vigorous to moderate exercise on
NAFLD, the vigorous exercise intervention lasted for only 6
months. Future trials should compare the long-term effects
of vigorous and moderate exercise on the IHTG content and
metabolic risk factors among patients with NAFLD. Second,
the primary outcome was the IHTG content instead of
biopsy-proven fibrosis or steatosis. However, the IHTG con-
tent measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy is highly
reproducible and correlated with the histologic features of
fibrosis and steatosis.34,35 Magnetic resonance spectroscopy
is regarded as the most accurate noninvasive method of
measuring liver fat among patients with NAFLD in clinical
practice.36 In addition, the IHTG content is more sensitive
than the steatosis grade determined by histologic analysis in
quantifying changes in liver fat content and has been recom-
mended for this specific use in clinical trials.37 In our study,
magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed using a
standard protocol based on 1.3-ppm lipid methylene protons
to avoid measurement variations.38 Third, dietary calorie
and fat intake were not controlled in this study because
we aimed to examine isolated effects of exercise on
NAFLD. Future clinical trials should examine the effects of
combined intervention strategies on long-term outcomes of
NAFLD.
Conclusions
This study indicates that vigorous and moderate exercise were
equally effective in reducing IHTG content, whereas vigor-
ousexercisemighthaveadditionalbenefitsinreducingweight,
body fat, and blood pressure among patients with NAFLD. For
individuals who might have difficulty engaging in vigorous ex-
ercise, moderate exercise would have the same effects on the
prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Most of the effect of the
interventions on the IHTG content appeared to be mediated
by weight loss.
