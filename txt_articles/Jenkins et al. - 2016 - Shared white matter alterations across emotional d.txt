Background: White matter (WM) integrity may represent a shared biomarker for emotional disorders (ED).
Aims: To identify transdiagnostic biomarkers of reduced WM by meta-analysis of findings across multiple EDs.
Method: Web of Science was searched systematically for studies of whole brain analysis of fractional anisotropy
(FA) in adults with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive
disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder compared with a healthy control (HC) group. Peak MNI coordinates
were extracted from 37 studies of voxel-based analysis (892 HC and 962 with ED) and meta-analyzed using
seed-based d Mapping (SDM) Version 4.31. Separate meta-analyses were also conducted for each disorder.
Results: In the transdiagnostic meta-analysis, reduced FA was identified in ED studies compared to HCs in the left
inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, forceps minor, uncinate fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiation, superior coro-
na radiata, bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculi, and cerebellum. Disorder-specific meta-analyses revealed the
OCD group had the most similarities in reduced FA to other EDs, with every cluster of reduced FA overlapping
with at least one other diagnosis. The PTSD group was the most distinct, with no clusters of reduced FA overlap-
ping with any other diagnosis. The BD group were the only disorder to show increased FA in any region, and
showed a more bilateral pattern of WM changes, compared to the other groups which tended to demonstrate
a left lateralized pattern of FA reductions.
Conclusions: Distinct diagnostic categories of ED show commonalities in WM tracts with reduced FA when com-
pared to HC, which links brain networks involved in cognitive and affective processing. This meta-analysis facil-
itates an increased understanding of the biological markers that are shared by these ED.

1. Introduction
White matter (WM) alterations have been identified in numerous
emotional disorders (ED), including mood and anxiety disorders (AD)
(Ayling et al., 2012; Nortje et al., 2013; Murphy and Frodl, 2011).
These alterations are important because disruption to WM pathways
could reveal a disconnection syndrome within neural circuits
(Schmahmann et al., 2008; Thomason and Thompson, 2011), potential-
ly modifying behavior and cognitive control of emotion. Although EDs
have distinct mechanisms, they share many phenotypic (Clark and
Watson, 1991) and genotypic commonalities (Kendler et al., 2003). Fur-
thermore, they are often comorbid with one another (Brown et al.,
2001; Kessler et al., 2005; Yerevanian et al., 2001). For example, 50–
60% of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) have a comor-
bid anxiety disorder (Fava et al., 2000; Kessler et al., 1996), such as
social anxiety disorder (SAD), panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety
disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). There is a high rate of comorbidity of these AD in
bipolar disorders (BD) (Freeman et al., 2002; Henry et al., 2003; Pini et
al., 1997; McElroy et al., 2001). Furthermore, the ADs are also highly co-
morbid within themselves (Goisman et al., 1995; Kessler et al., 1995;
Pietrzrak et al., 2011). This study therefore sought to conduct a meta-
analysis of studies of WM in mood and AD (hereafter emotion disorders,
ED), to determine which WM alterations are common or distinct to
these classes of psychopathologies. Given the call for transdiagnostic
mechanisms put forth by NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) ini-
tiative (Insel et al., 2010), it is particularly timely to identify shared neu-
ral circuitry abnormalities across multiple classes of EDs.
Numerous structural models of psychopathology have reliably re-
ported commonalities among MDD and ADs, with both loading on a
broad ‘internalizing disorders’ factor (a factor which appears to be dis-
tinct from ‘externalizing’ conditions such as substance use disorders
(Vollebergh et al., 2001)). It is somewhat unclear where BD falls in
this hierarchy, with some studies showing that it loads on a separate

 factor from MDD and ADs (Watson, 2005; Kotov et al., 2015). Given the
high prevalence of comorbid externalizing disorders such as substance
abuse in BD (Cassidy et al., 2001), it is possible that BD includes both in-
ternalizing and externalizing features. Furthermore, although most
studies of WM abnormalities in BD have reported decreases in integrity
similar to studies of MDD, increased measures of integrity in the left un-
cinate fasciculus and optic radiation have been reported (Versace et al.,
2008). By aggregating data from multiple studies of ED, we hypothesize
that this meta-analysis will identify WM alterations that are shared
across ED. This knowledge will provide important insights into potential
mechanisms that are shared across these classes of disorders. To our
knowledge, no previous meta-analysis has attempted to examine WM
abnormalities compared to healthy controls across MDD, BD and ADs.
Therefore the results of this study, which followed the guidelines for
Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology, will be impor-
tant for identifying transdiagnostic biomarkers of WM pathology in ED.
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures the degree to which ran-
domly diffusing water molecules move in one direction, rather than all
directions of tissues (Thomason and Thompson, 2011), providing an in-
dication of the orientation and integrity of WM fibers (Beaulieu, 2002;
Kumar et al., 2015). The diffusion tensor is estimated at each voxel,
and eigenvalues are calculated which indicate the extent of diffusion.
Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a ratio of eigenvalues ranging from 0 (iso-
tropic) to 1 (unidirectional, anisotropic movement) that reflects the de-
gree to which diffusion is confined to a particular direction (Kumar et
al., 2015). FA usually decreases in damaged, disorganized or atrophied
WM (Thomason and Thompson, 2011), however it is only an indirect
marker of WM microstructure (see discussion). Nevertheless, given it
is the most widely reported DTI measure, FA was selected as the variable
of interest for the present meta-analysis.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study selection
The Web of Science database was systematically searched by a post-
doctoral researcher (LMJ) on the 16th of September 2014 using search
terms (“DTI” OR “diffusion tensor”) AND (“anxiety” OR “depress*” OR
“bipolar” OR “mania”). Reference lists were also manually searched for
suitable papers, resulting in 695 results. A subsequent editorial decision
to add OCD and PTSD resulted in a new Web of Science search on the
12th of April 2016, and yielded 228 results. This search included the
terms (“OCD” OR “obsessive compulsive” OR “PTSD” OR “post traumatic
stress disorder”) AND (“DTI” OR “diffusion tensor” OR “fractional anisot-
ropy”). In total, 923 studies were identified by these two systematic
searches (Fig. 1). Borderline personality disorder was considered for in-
clusion in the meta-analysis since this diagnosis also involves emotion
dysregulation, however we were unable to locate any studies that met
our inclusion criteria. Specifically, we conducted a literature search in
Web of Science on April 5th, 2016, using the search terms “Borderline
personality” and “DTI or diffusion tensor or fractional anisotropy”. This
search yielded 25 results. Of these 25 results, none met our inclusion/
exclusion criteria for entry into the study. There were 6 reviews, 3 ab-
stracts, 2 studies that did not involve DTI, 4 that did not involve Border-
line personality disorder, 5 were not whole-brain studies, 2 that only
included adolescents. The remaining 3 studies involved TBSS. Since
the main analysis used VBA and the TBSS analysis was used to support
the findings of the VBA analysis, we decided not to include borderline
personality disorder. As this was a meta-analysis of de-identified pub-
lished results, institutional ethical approval was not required for this
study.
Criteria for inclusion were: Whole brain (using voxel-based analysis,
VBA) or whole WM (using tract-based spatial statistics, TBSS) analysis
of FA in human participants with either MDD, BD or AD, reported in
standardized 3D space, constituting original data from participants
aged 18–65 years, compared with a healthy control (HC) group,
reported in English in a peer-reviewed journal. Given the common co-
morbidity of PTSD with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), studies of PTSD
that did not exclude patients with TBI or provide separate results for a
non-TBI sub group were excluded. Fig. 1 shows a flowchart of the selec-
tion of studies for inclusion. For the purposes of this meta-analysis, AD
were limited to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety dis-
order (SAD), panic disorder (PD), obsessive compulsive disorder
(OCD) or post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our literature search
identified only one study of GAD that met our inclusion criteria, so
GAD was excluded, since one study is not sufficient to establish with-
in-disorder reliability. All studies of PD used TBSS, which was analyzed
separately, thus the meta-analysis combined two classes of mood disor-
der (BD and MDD), and three classes of AD (SAD, OCD and PTSD) to ex-
amine transdiagnostic WM alterations for EDs.
The meta-analysis was conducted using seed-based d Mapping
(SDM) Version 4.31 (described below). Unlike some other methods,
SDM incorporates both positive and negative peaks, and null studies,
thus whilst the majority of studies of FA in ED report reduced FA com-
pared to HCs, we were able to include studies in the meta-analyses
that reported null results or increased FA. SDM cannot simply or directly

 meta-analyze statistical parametric maps from diffusion-weighted
studies that utilized whole brain WM as well as studies that used
TBSS. This is due to the fact that the TBSS method restricts its analysis
to mean FA tract skeletons, which do not completely overlap across
studies. We chose the approach taken by previous researchers who
used SDM (Nortje et al., 2013; Radua et al., 2014), and only meta-ana-
lyzed the VBA results. However for a supplementary analysis we also ex-
tracted data from the TBSS studies and conducted a separate meta-
analysis in an attempt to support our results (see Supplement).
2.2. Data extraction
In total, there were 892 healthy controls (HCs) and 962 participants
with ED. These included 415 participants with MDD, 273 with BD, 73
with SAD, 110 with OCD and 91 with PTSD. Only whole-brain WM re-
sults were reported; furthermore, we only included the whole-brain
corrected results, unless the only significant results were uncorrected,
then these were included (e.g. Arnold et al., 2012). SDM requires that in-
cluded studies have the same correction across the whole brain (al-
though it may differ between studies). This is to avoid biasing results
towards regions more liberally thresholded (Radua and Matrix-Cols,
2009). When studies reported separate results by illness subtype,
these were included as separate studies, i.e. two studies with non-over-
lapping contrasts for BD I and BD II (Liu et al., 2010; Ha et al., 2011), one
study with separate results for suicide attempters and non-attempters
with MDD (Jia et al., 2010), and one study with separate results for
OCD and treatment-resistant OCD (TROCD) (Li et al., 2014). The 37
VBA studies and 41 contrasts included in the meta-analysis are reported
in Table 1.
Data were extracted independently by two researchers (LMJ, AB), in-
cluding the number of males and females in each group, age, illness
duration, diagnostic tool, handedness, medication status, psychiatric co-
morbidities, number of diffusion directions, B0, voxel size, imaging se-
quence, b value and statistical thresholds. All imaging was performed as
spin-echo EPIs. Where necessary authors were contacted for further infor-
mation. For the meta-analysis, from each contrast we extracted peak MNI
coordinates and t values of FA differences between ED and HC groups.
Peak coordinates were double-checked by both researchers. Foci reported
in Talairach space were converted to MNI space with Brett's transform
(http://eeg.sourceforge.net/doc_m2html/bioelectromagnetism/mni2tal_
matrix.html). When only z or p values were available, these were convert-
ed to t values using the SDM online conversion utilities.
2.3. Meta-analysis
Seed-based d Mapping (SDM), described in more detail elsewhere
(Radua and Matrix-Cols, 2009; Radua et al., 2012), is a statistical tech-
nique for meta-analysis of neuroimaging data, including diffusion ten-
sor imaging (DTI). SDM uses a random effects model that takes into
account sample size, intra-study variability, and between-study hetero-
geneity, and statistical significance is assessed using a distribution-free
permutation test (Radua et al., 2012). A main reason we chose SDM
was because it has a specific mask correlation template for FA (Radua
et al., 2011). This specific template accounts for the anisotropy in the
spatial covariance of the brain, which increases the accuracy of the effect
size maps, and has been successful in prior mood disorder studies
(Nortje et al., 2013). While other meta-analyses of mood disorders
have used different techniques, such as Activation Likelihood Estima-
tion, these techniques are not optimal for use with DTI studies as they
do not include a white-matter mask, and they also cannot include clus-
ters of both increased and decreased FA in patients compared to HC.
Similar to Nortje et al. (2013), we employed threshold values of
p b 0.005, Z N 1 and k = 10. This threshold has been shown to optimize
sensitivity at the same time as correctly controlling the false positive
rate, and was approximately equivalent to a corrected p value of .025
(Radua et al., 2012). Peaks of significant clusters were labeled
automatically by the SDM software (Rojkova et al., 2016; Thiebaut de
Schotten et al., 2011a, 2011b). A jack-knife analysis was performed to
establish reliability of the results (Radua and Matrix-Cols, 2009). Publi-
cation bias was assessed with funnel plots (Supplement) and Egger
tests. As per a previous SMD meta-analyses (Murphy and Frodl, 2011),
a linear meta-regression assessed the influence of illness duration. An
additional linear meta-regression assessed the influence of depression
severity, as measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
(HDRS).
3. Results
3.1. Transdiagnostic (shared) meta-analysis
The results of the ED meta-analysis are presented in Fig. 2. For all sig-
nificant clusters, the ED studies reported reduced FA compared to HCs.
Cluster peaks are reported in Table 2.
The largest cluster incorporated several white matter tracts, includ-
ing the left forceps minor of the corpus callosum (CC), anterior thalamic
radiations (ATR), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) and the unci-
nate fasciculus. The second largest cluster peaked in the left superior
longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and also involved white matter in the pa-
rietal lobe. The third largest cluster peaked in the left cerebellum (hemi-
spheric lobule I-IV), and there was a smaller cluster in the right
cerebellum (hemispheric lobule VI). Another cluster peaked in the left
superior corona radiata and incorporated the corticospinal tract. The
smallest cluster peaked in the right SLF. For illustrative purposes, Fig. 3
shows the location of these clusters of reduced FA on the affected fiber
tracts, which are otherwise intact. It should be noted that we did not
perform tractography, rather Fig. 3 shows the significant clusters
found in our meta-analysis superimposed on a standard tractography
image. Significant clusters are shown in green, and affected WM tracts
in yellow, for illustrative purposes. A three dimensional video is avail-
able in the online Supplement.
To support these main findings from the VBA studies, we also ex-
tracted data from the TBSS studies and conducted a separate meta-anal-
ysis. These results are reported in the Supplement.
3.2. Illness duration analysis
A linear meta-regression was conducted in SDM to assess the influ-
ence of illness duration (years). Illness duration information was not
available for 12 studies (three MDD, two BD, one SAD, two OCD and
four, i.e. all PTSD). A univariate ANOVA found a significant effect of
group for illness duration, F (3, 25) = 4.87, p = 0.008. The BD contrasts
(n = 10) had the longest mean illness duration = 11.80, (SD = 5.65);
SAD (n = 2), mean illness duration = 10.05, (SD = 8.41); OCD (n =
7), mean illness duration = 8.65, (SD = 6.71); the MDD contrasts
(n = 10) included patients with the shortest mean illness duration =
2.91 (SD = 3.00). Post hoc tests found a significant difference in illness
duration between the MDD and BD groups (p = 0.005).
The linear meta-regression revealed longer illness duration was as-
sociated with increased FA in nine diffuse brain regions, including sever-
al posterior clusters located in the forceps major, and decreased FA in
seven brain regions, of which six were left lateralised. These results
are reported in Table 3. The finding of increased FA associated with lon-
ger illness duration in several regions is difficult to interpret because of
the significant difference in illness duration between the MDD and BD
group, which may reflect an interaction.
3.3. Depression severity analysis
A linear meta-regression was also conducted to assess the influence
of current depression severity, as measured by the Hamilton Rating
Scale for Depression (HDRS). HDRS score was not available for 18 stud-
ies (three each of MDD and BD, five of OCD, and three and four, i.e. all, of
1028
L.M. Jenkins et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 12 (2016) 1022–1034
 SAD and PTSD, respectively). An ANOVA found a significant main effect
of group for HDRS, F (2, 21) = 126.65, p b 0.001. Post hoc tests revealed
that the MDD contrasts (M = 21.93, SD = 2.20) included patients with
significantly higher HDRS scores than the BD contrasts (M = 4.72, SD =
2.53), p b 0.001, and the OCD contrasts (M = 13.83, SD = 1.18),
p b 0.001. The BD and OCD contrasts also differed significantly,
p b 0.001. Table 4 reports that higher HDRS score (indicating greater
current depression severity) predicted decreased FA in four regions,
with the largest clusters peaking in the left ATR and superior longitudi-
nal fasciculus. Comparison of these results to those of Fig. 4 reveals that
as expected, given the significantly higher HDRS scores in the MDD
group, the regions significantly associated with depression severity
were all regions that showed significantly reduced FA in MDD in the dis-
order-specific meta-analysis, reported below.
3.4. Assessments of reliability and publication bias
The Jack-knife analysis found that the left SLF cluster (−40, −40,
32) remained significant across all 41 sub-analyses, indicating that
this was the most robust finding. The largest cluster, located in the left
IFOF (−24, 40, −6), remained significant in all sub-analyses except
for in five sub-analyses for which the peak of this cluster shifted to a dif-
ferent location within this large cluster (−12, 18, 6). The cluster in the
left superior corona radiata (−18, −12, 44) was quite robust, remain-
ing significant in 40 sub-analyses (excluding Sussmann et al., 2009).
The clusters in the left (−10, −48, −24) and right cerebellum (26,
−52, −26) were both significant in 39 sub analyses, and the right SLF
(36, 20, 20) was significant in 38 sub-analyses.
Publication bias was assessed by extracting values from each of the
significant peaks in the ED meta-analysis. Funnel plots were created to
allow for visual inspection of the inter-study heterogeneity (see Supple-
ment). Egger tests were calculated and revealed no evidence for publi-
cation bias for any of the clusters, p N 0.05.
3.5. Disorder-specific meta-analyses
We also conducted separate meta-analyses for each ED. These re-
sults are presented in Fig. 4. Peak coordinates of these results are report-
ed in the Supplement. The two largest peaks of reduced FA in MDD
contrasts were in left hemisphere regions of the ATR and SLF, which
were two of the most robust regions identified from the Jackknife anal-
ysis. The BD contrasts revealed the only increase in FA (relative to HC),
in the right SLF. They also had decreased FA in this same tract more an-
teriorly. Other regions of decreased FA in the right hemisphere were the
forceps minor and IFOF, however the BD group also had decreased FA in
several left hemisphere regions, including the SLF, cingulum, forceps
minor and cerebellum. The SAD studies showed a primarily left
lateralized pattern of decreased FA, which occurred in the SLF and
corticospinal tract, and the UF bilaterally (more ventrally on the right).
Two of the clusters for SAD overlapped with OCD and/or MDD. The
OCD group showed reduced FA in several regions, all of which over-
lapped with at least one other diagnosis. These included the left SLF,
IFOF, cerebellum and right ILF, shared with the BD contrasts, the left su-
perior corona radiata shared with the SAD contrasts, the left IFOF/UF/
ATR shared with the MDD and SAD contrasts, and the right cerebellum
shared with the MDD group. Finally, like the OCD, SAD and to a lesser
extent MDD contrasts, the PTSD contrasts revealed reduced FA in

 primarily left hemisphere regions. Unlike OCD and to a lesser extent
SAD, however, these regions did not overlap with those of other disor-
ders. Reduced FA was found in the left UF, however this was inferior
to the region identified in MDD, SAD and OCD. Similarly, the region of
the left SLF identified in the PTSD contrasts was inferior to that of the
other diagnoses. There was also reduced FA in the left cingulum and
the right ILF in PTSD.
4. Discussion
The present meta-analysis revealed that overall, emotional disorders
exhibit a shared pattern of reduced FA in fronto-temporal and fronto-
parietal white matter tracts compared to HCs. The most robust and rep-
licable finding (determined by Jack-knife analysis), peaked in the left
superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). The largest cluster identified
peaked in the left forceps minor/inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus,
and extended to include the uncinate fasciculus (UF) and anterior tha-
lamic radiations (ATR). There was also a significant peak in the region
of the left superior corona radiata/corticospinal tract, bilateral cerebel-
lum and right SLF. These tracts link important networks involved in cog-
nition, affect, and the regulation thereof. The discussion therefore
focuses on the SLF, IFOF, UF, anterior corpus callosum and tracts within
the cerebellum, including evidence for their potential functional roles
that may be relevant to emotional disorders. We also present converg-
ing evidence for alterations in FA in these tracts in ED from the TBSS
studies listed in the Supplement. Due to space limitation, relatively
less discussion of ED differences is provided.
4.1. Superior longitudinal fasciculus
The left SLF was the most replicable tract identified in the
transdiagnostic meta-analysis. The SLF is a major association fiber
tract connecting parieto-temporal association areas and the frontal
lobe, and links aspects of default mode (medially) and cognitive control
(laterally) networks. The SLF II terminates in the dorsolateral PFC
(Makris et al., 2005), which is closely associated with executive func-
tioning (Tekin and Cummings, 2002). Thus the SLF II may offer a
means for the PFC to control the focusing of spatial attention by the pa-
rietal lobe (Schmahmann et al., 2008; Makris et al., 2005). The SLF III is
located in the parietal and frontal opercula and reaches from the
supramarginal gyrus to ventral prefrontal and premotor areas (Makris
et al., 2005). It provides higher order somatosensory input to the ventral
premotor region and pars opercularis. It may also be important for mon-
itoring hand and facial action, as well as articulatory and phonemic as-
pects of language (Schmahmann et al., 2008; Makris et al., 2005).
These functions are consistent with the impairments in perception of
and attention to emotional information in ED, including prosody and fa-
cial expressions of emotion. Our findings of reduced FA in the SLF are
also supported by the TBSS studies reported in the Supplement, includ-
ing findings from studies of reduced FA in the left SLF in OCD (Spalletta
et al., 2014) and PTSD (Fani et al., 2012), as well of studies of BD

 (Ambrosi et al., 2013), particularly in the left SLF (Versace et al., 2010),
as well as in the right hemisphere in MDD (Murphy et al., 2012) and
OCD (Benedetti et al., 2013), and bilaterally in treatment-resistant de-
pression (de Diego-Adelino et al., 2014).
We also found evidence for increased FA in BD in the right SLF. In-
creased FA in BD has been reported previously (Versace et al., 2008).
Whilst this may seem counter-intuitive, it is important to note that
higher FA reflects more numerous, myelinated, dense, and coherently
orientated fibers in many circumstances, but it does not always signify
healthier WM or beneficial outcomes. On the contrary, higher FA
could suggest, for example, compensatory mechanisms, as WM struc-
ture is shaped by experiences (Thomason and Thompson, 2011). There-
fore, when evaluating results of FA studies, the interpretation that
decreased FA is maladaptive and increased FA is adaptive may be too
simplistic an explanation.
4.2. Inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus
The largest cluster peaked in the left IFOF, connecting the dorsolater-
al and inferolateral frontal cortex with the occipital lobe and posterior
temporal cortex (Catani et al., 2002). As such, the IFOF is an intra- and
cross-network connection of cognitive control and salience networks
often implicated in EDs. The IFOF traverses the sagittal striatum, and
progresses posteriorly through the medial temporal lobe, passing
through the anterior floor of the external capsule where it is parallel
to the inferiorly located UF fibers (Catani et al., 2002). The fronto-occip-
ital fasciculus comprises part of the dorsal visual stream and is implicat-
ed in peripheral vision and processing visuospatial information
(Schmahmann et al., 2008) and the IFOF is located near a region impor-
tant for processing of facial emotions (Nakamura et al., 1999). The find-
ing of reduced FA in the left IFOF in the VBA studies is supported by the
TBSS studies listed in the Supplement, which have reported reduced FA
in this region in patients with OCD (Benedetti et al., 2013), MDD
(Kieseppa et al., 2010), melancholic MDD (Korgaonkar et al., 2011),
and in patients with MDD who were homozygous for the A allele of
NTRK2 (Murphy et al., 2012), a neurotrophic factor hypothesized to be
a risk factor for MDD. Reduced FA bilaterally has also been reported in
the IFOF in patients with TRD (de Diego-Adelino et al., 2014) in BD
(Ambrosi et al., 2013; Chan et al., 2010), PD (Lai and Wu, 2013) and
OCD (Fan et al., 2016).
4.3. Uncinate fasciculus
The UF joins the orbital and polar frontal cortex to the anterior tem-
poral lobe, as it reaches out from the amgydala, hippocampal gyrus,
uncus and temporal pole (Catani et al., 2002). Considered part of the
limbic system (emotion and salience networks), the UF may be a path-
way via which the PFC exerts control over limbic regions involved in
emotion processing, an ability that is reduced in MDD (Anand et al.,
2005). The UF is an important part of the system for regulating emotion-
al responses to auditory stimuli (Schmahmann et al., 2008), and could
also play a role in attaching emotional valence to visual stimuli. Reduced
FA in the UF might support a mechanism of decreased salience and
emotional network connectivity and activity in limbic regions, including
the amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, which lie at both
ends of the UF.
The strongest evidence for reduced FA in the UF in ED is from studies
of MDD. For example, tractography studies (excluded from our analysis
as they do not report stereotactic coordinates) have reported reduced
FA in the UF in MDD (Zhang et al., 2012; de Kwaasteniet et al., 2013).
Murphy et al. (2012) found reduced FA in patients with MDD compared
to HC in the left UF. Another FA study with an upper age limit beyond
65 years also found reduced FA in the left UF in MDD (Steele et al.,
2005). However Lai and Wu (2013) failed to demonstrate reduced FA
in panic disorder, and results from individual studies of BD are more
mixed, with Ambrosi et al. (2013) finding reduced FA in the UF of pa-
tients with BD, but Versace et al. (2008) reporting increased FA. Further
research is necessary to determine the impact of hypo/manic symptoms
on FA in BD.
4.4. Anterior corpus callosum
The CC is critical for interhemispheric communication, particularly
the integration of high-level cognitive, emotional, perceptual and lin-
guistic functions across numerous networks (Gazzaniga, 2000). The for-
ceps minor of the CC was implicated in the largest cluster in the ED

 analysis. Some, but not all studies (Yurgelun-Todd et al., 2007) that
were not included because they exceeded the upper age limit to 65
have also reported reduced FA in the forceps minor and genu of the
CC in individuals with MDD (Cole et al., 2012; Seok et al., 2013) and
BD (Benedetti et al., 2011). Numerous TBSS studies included in the Sup-
plement reported reduced FA in the forceps minor/genu of the CC, in-
cluding for MDD (Murphy et al., 2012), young adults with first-
episode, treatment-responsive depression (Guo et al., 2012) and pa-
tients with treatment resistant depression (de Diego-Adelino et al.,
2014). One TBSS study of OCD also found reduced FA in the forceps
minor bilaterally (Benedetti et al., 2013), consistent with Fig. 4 that
showed this region to be affected in the left hemisphere in OCD in the
VBA meta-analysis.
4.5. Cerebellum
Tracts within the cerebellum are known to connect with the PFC,
subcortical limbic nuclei, and brainstem structures that produce mono-
amines (Schmahmann, 2000). The anterior lobe has a primary sensori-
motor region, and the posterior lobe contains association areas
important for higher order behavior, via connections with basis pontis
and thalamic nuclei (Schmahmann and Caplan, 2006). Disrupted cere-
bellar and corticocerebellar connectivity has been proposed as a main
neurobiological mechanism of emotion dysregulation (Schmahmann,
2000), as lesions confined to the cerebellum can result in a cerebellar
cognitive affective syndrome that includes dysregulation of affect
(Schmahmann and Caplan, 2006).
4.6. Distinctiveness of each finding across EDs
Notably, the results of the transdiagnostic meta-analyses are primar-
ily left lateralized. Severity of post-stroke depression has also been cor-
related with proximity of stroke lesion to the left frontal pole, which
may align with the shared negative affect across these EDs. However
this association has been found both in cortical lesions and lesions re-
stricted to subcortical regions (Starkstein and Robinson, 1987), thus de-
pression following brain lesions cannot be attributed to disruptions to
WM alone. Furthermore, stroke lesions impair signal transport by
destroying nerve fiber bundles locally, in contrast to decreased signal
transport due to a more extensive impairment of neurons. Whilst our
focus was largely on shared WM alterations across all three disorders,
there is some evidence of differences. Most notably, the PTSD findings
were the most distinct, demonstrating no overlap with any other EDs
for any of the significant clusters in the separate meta-analyses for
each disorder. The OCD group showed overlap with both categories of
mood disorders, including for clusters in the right hemisphere. OCD
also showed overlap with SAD for two of the clusters, one of which it
also shared with MDD (the largest cluster, i.e. the IFOF/ATR/UF/forceps
minor cluster). The BD findings were more bilateral relative to the ten-
dency for left laterality observed across the other groups. This laterality
finding harkens back to early lesion research suggesting right hemi-
sphere stroke is associated with a hypomanic state characterized by in-
appropriate cheerfulness, loss of interest, anxiety, slowness and
agitation (Robinson et al., 1983). Left prefrontal hypometabolism has
also been reported in patients with BD in the depressed phase (Baxter
et al., 1989). However, subsequent studies have found little consistent
support for lateralization of mood or emotion, and only limited support
for the valence hypothesis of emotion in the frontal cortex (Wager et al.,
2003). BD also differed from the other disorders in that it was the only
one to find increased FA in any region. This finding supports previous
findings that BD loads on a separate factor from MDD and AD
(Watson, 2005; Kotov et al., 2015); however it may also suggest BD is
the addition of a separate manic disorder to MDD and/or AD. Future
studies might examine the relationship between increases in FA for con-
trasts between internalizing and externalizing symptoms.
4.7. Limitations
The present study had several limitations. First, there were insuffi-
cient GAD studies using VBA that met our inclusion criteria, and all stud-
ies of panic disorder used TBSS thus were only able to be included in the
Supplemental analysis. Second, we chose to exclude studies with any
subjects outside of the age range 18–65 to limit the potential influence
of degenerative conditions and development, thus numerous studies
primarily involving adults were excluded (Steele et al., 2005; Seok et
al., 2013; Benedetti et al., 2011). The included studies differed in diffu-
sion imaging methods, which could limit the interpretability of the find-
ings. For example, more recent studies tend to use correcting
procedures for EPI distortions that more dated studies did not, which
could impact findings in proximity of brain regions that are sensitive
to B0 inhomogeneities. There are also limitations in the interpretation
of FA, as it is only an indirect marker of WM microstructure. Although
commonly interpreted to reflect decreased myelination or progressive
myelin degradation due to a loss of oligodendrocyte cells, there are
other interpretations of reduced FA. For instance, low FA could also be
the result of axonal damage, reduced fibers (axonal density), or disorga-
nized fibers (Thomason and Thompson, 2011; Kumar et al., 2015). It
could all be the result of inadequate stimulation of anatomic structures
or pathways. Furthermore, microstructural alterations in the brain may
be an antecedent and/or a consequence of disease. It is unclear at this
point how length and severity of illness might affect DTI measurements.
The diffusion tensor method has received criticism for underestimating
FA in regions where fibers cross. Thus findings in such areas of crossing
fasciculi should be interpreted with caution. Newer models such as
mode of anisotropy avoid such limitations and allow a more meaningful
interpretation of FA results (Kumar et al., 2015). Finally, our discussion
of the functionality of the decreased FA in each area in relation to the
EDs are speculative and require additional research to verify whether
these functions are indeed reduced in these disorders, and whether
they precede or are a consequence of them.
5. Conclusions
Consistent with the NIMH RDoC initiative, we attempted to identify
WM alterations common across different types of ED compared to HCs.
Reduced FA occurred in tracts that connect emotion, salience and cogni-
tive control networks. Future studies would benefit from looking at
transdiagnostic symptom, cognitive, and affective domains, given the
high co-occurrence of many depressive and/or anxious disorders.
Through these multi-method studies the field will develop a more com-
plete understanding of common and specific symptoms and associated
phenotypes and develop improved treatment targets.
