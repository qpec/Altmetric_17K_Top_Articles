IMPORTANCE It is unclear if the risk of intraocular bleeding with novel oral anticoagulants
differs compared with warfarin.
OBJECTIVE To characterize the risk of intraocular bleeding with novel oral anticoagulants
compared with warfarin.
DATA SOURCES A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken in an academic
medical setting. MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized clinical trials
published up until August 2016. This search was supplemented by manual bibliography
searches of identified trials and other review articles.
STUDY SELECTION Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were phase 3 randomized clinical
trials, enrolled patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism, compared a novel
oral anticoagulant (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban) with warfarin, and
recorded event data on intraocular bleeding. Data on intraocular bleeding were pooled using
inverse-variance, weighted, fixed-effects meta-analysis.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The PRISMA guidelines were used for abstracting data and
assessing quality. Independent extraction was performed by 2 investigators.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Intraocular bleeding events and associated risk ratio for
novel oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin.
RESULTS Twelve trials investigating 102 627 patients were included. Randomization to novel
oral anticoagulants was associated with a 22% relative reduction in intraocular bleeding
compared with warfarin (risk ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61-0.99). There was no significant
heterogeneity observed (I2 = 4.8%, P = .40). Comparably lower risks of intraocular bleeding
with novel oral anticoagulants were seen in subgroup analyses, with no significant difference
according to the indication for anticoagulation (P for heterogeneity = .49) or the novel oral
anticoagulant type (P for heterogeneity = .15). Summary estimates did not differ materially
when random-effects meta-analytic techniques were used.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest that novel oral anticoagulants reduce
the risk of intraocular bleeding by approximately one-fifth compared with warfarin. Similar
benefits were seen in both patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Our
data have particular relevance for patients at higher risk of spontaneous retinal and subretinal
bleeding. These findings may also have important implications in the perioperative period, in
which the use of novel oral anticoagulants may be superior. Future studies are required to
better characterize the optimal management of patients with both ophthalmic disease and
cardiovascular comorbidities requiring anticoagulation.

 I
n recent years, novel oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, riva-
roxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) have become widely
used worldwide in patients with atrial fibrillation and in pa-
tients with venous thromboembolism. Several phase 3 ran-
domized clinical trials1-3 have established equal or superior
antithrombotic efficacy of these agents and lower risk of intra-
cranial hemorrhage compared with warfarin. Intraocular
hemorrhage is an uncommon but potentially visually threat-
ening adverse event that has been well documented in
patients taking warfarin and other antithrombotics.4-8 In the
only previous meta-analysis9 on this topic to our knowledge,
no significant difference was reported in the risk of intraocu-
lar bleeding between novel oral anticoagulants and other anti-
thrombotic agents, such as warfarin. However, the authors
acknowledged that this conclusion may have been susceptible
to a lack of statistical power given the limited number of
bleeding events. Moreover, analyses were performed only
within disease indications, further reducing the ability to
detect significant differences. Given this uncertainty, we
sought to perform an updated meta-analysis on the risk of
intraocular bleeding with novel oral anticoagulants compared
with warfarin. We include additional data, analyze event data
across disease indications, and discuss the implications of our
findings in patients at high risk of spontaneous intraocular
bleeding and in the perioperative setting.
Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed in
an academic medical setting in accord with the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines.10 The PRISMA checklist is included in
eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Eligibility Criteria for Considering
Studies for This Study
We restricted our analysis to phase 3 randomized clinical
trials that included patients with atrial fibrillation or venous
thromboembolism who were randomly assigned to receive
novel oral anticoagulants or warfarin. Studies were eligible
for inclusion if data on intraocular bleeding were available as
a predefined study outcome or from adverse event reports.
We contacted study authors to obtain event data if this infor-
mation was not readily available from the published articles.
We did not use any data from phase 2 dose-ranging studies
because of their small sample size and short follow-up.
Search for Identifying Studies
We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE published up
until August 2016. Search terms included atrial fibrillation,
pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, deep venous
thrombosis, venous thromboembolism, dabigatran, rivaroxa-
ban, apixaban, edoxaban, factor Xa inhibitor, thrombin inhibi-
tor, vitamin K antagonist, and warfarin. We also performed a
search of ClinicalTrials.gov and manually searched bibliogra-
phies of identified trials, review articles, and meta-analyses
to find relevant studies.
Study Selection
Two investigators (M.T.S. and C.X.W.) independently
reviewed all identified studies for inclusion. The decision to
include studies was hierarchical, initially based on the study
title, followed by abstract and then full-text review of each
remaining article. Disagreements were resolved by discus-
sion between the 2 investigators.
Data Collection, Risk-of-Bias Assessment,
and Overall Quality of Evidence
The number of individuals in the treatment and control arms,
number of intraocular bleeds in both arms, novel oral antico-
agulant used, and indication for anticoagulation were
recorded. A risk ratio from the total number of events was
calculated for each trial.
The Cochrane Collaboration’
s risk-of-bias tool was used to
evaluate risk of bias for included trials.11 Risk of bias was evalu-
ated on the following 5 dimensions: selection bias (defined as
randomsequencegenerationandallocationconcealment),per-
formance bias (masking of both participants and investiga-
tors), detection bias (masking of evaluators), attrition bias (in-
completeoutcomedata),andreportingbias(selectiveoutcome
reporting). Each dimension was judged to be of low, unclear,
or high risk of bias. The bias in the effect estimate was as-
sessed for each individual outcome, and the trial was then
judged to be of low, unclear, or high risk of bias, depending on
whether a trial resulted in a biased effect estimate and would
have led to bias in the reported intraocular bleeding out-
come. We also rated the quality of evidence using the Grad-
ingofRecommendationsAssessment,DevelopmentandEvalu-
ation (GRADE) Working Group approach.12
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Overall effect estimates were calculated using inverse-
variance, weighted, fixed-effects meta-analysis with 95% CIs.
Random-effects meta-analysis was performed as a sensitiv-
ity analysis. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 statis-
tic and tested between subgroups using Cochran Q statistic.
Themainanalysiswasperformedtoaddresswhethernoveloral
anticoagulants reduce the risk of intraocular bleeding com-
pared with warfarin. As prespecified secondary analyses, we
stratified trials by whether they were conducted in patients
with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism and
Key Points

between patients receiving warfarin compared with the newer
novel oral anticoagulants?
Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of phase 3
randomized clinical trials involving 102 627 patients, use of novel
oral anticoagulants was associated with a reduced risk of
intraocular bleeding by one-fifth compared with warfarin.
Meaning Patients requiring anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation or
venous thromboembolism at high risk of spontaneous intraocular
bleeding may benefit from novel oral anticoagulant therapy.

 similar between trials, as was the proportion of men re-
cruited. The median time in therapeutic range among pa-
tients receiving warfarin ranged from 55% to 65.3%. Included

quality evidence for the assessed outcome (eTable 2 and eFig-
ure 2 in the Supplement).
Risk of Intraocular Bleeding With Novel Oral Anticoagulants
Compared With Warfarin
Randomization to novel oral anticoagulants was associated
with a 22% relative reduction in intraocular bleeding com-
pared with warfarin (risk ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61-0.99)
(Figure 2). The absolute risk decrease in intraocular bleeding
associated with novel oral anticoagulant use compared with
warfarin was 0.8 bleeds per 1000 person-years. There was no
significant heterogeneity observed (I2 = 4.8%, P = .40), and es-
timates did not differ materially when random-effects meta-
analysiswasused(eFigure3intheSupplement).Thelowerrisk
of intraocular bleeding with novel oral anticoagulants com-
pared with warfarin was similar in patients with atrial fibril-
lation (risk ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.62-1.07) and in patients with
venous thromboembolism (risk ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.37-1.14)
(P for heterogeneity = .49) (Figure 3). Similarly, relative ef-
fects of novel oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin ap-
peared to be similar regardless of the type of novel oral anti-
coagulant (P for heterogeneity = .15) (Figure 3). Estimates did
not differ materially when random-effects meta-analysis was
used (eFigure 4 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In our analyses, we demonstrate that novel oral anticoagu-
lants reduce the risk of intraocular bleeding by approximately

 one-fifth compared with warfarin. This finding has signifi-
cant clinical implications for ophthalmologists managing pa-
tients receiving anticoagulation, particularly for those at high
riskofintraocularbleeding.Furthermore,ourresultsmayhave
relevance for the perioperative management of patients re-
ceiving anticoagulation.
In the only previous meta-analysis on this topic, by
Caldeira and colleagues,9 the risk of intraocular bleeding was
analyzed within subgroups according to the indication for an-
ticoagulation.Asaresult,theauthorsconcludedthattherewas
no difference in bleeding risk between novel oral anticoagu-
lants and warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (risk
ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.59-1.19) and in patients with venous
thromboembolism (risk ratio, 0.67; 95% 0.37-1.20). While the
95% CIs for these risk estimates cross unity, suggesting a lack
of statistical significance, the actual point estimates and wide
95% CIs reported indicate that novel oral anticoagulants may
have a moderate benefit (16% and 33% lower risk of intraocu-
lar bleeding, respectively). Therefore, their results do not pro-
vide reliable evidence of a lack of difference in intraocular
bleeding. Indeed, our results taken as a whole suggest the con-
verse. By pooling data across indications for anticoagulation
and including additional data from other phase 3 random-
ized clinical trials, our analysis demonstrates that novel oral
anticoagulants reduce the risk of intraocular bleeding by ap-
proximately one-fifth compared with warfarin. This differ-
ence was not only statistically significant, but we also show
that this benefit appears to be similar regardless of the indi-
cation for anticoagulation (atrial fibrillation or venous throm-
boembolism) or the type of novel oral anticoagulant.
The exact mechanism for the reduced risk of intraocular
bleeding with novel oral anticoagulants compared with war-
farin is uncertain. Similar to the reduced risk of intracranial
bleeding, this effect could be partially attributable to the fact
that novel oral anticoagulants target only a single site in the
coagulation cascade compared with multiple sites with
warfarin.22 Furthermore, novel oral anticoagulants are known
to have no direct effect on factor VIIa, which may add to their
bleeding benefit. Finally, modest time in therapeutic range re-
mains a considerable concern with warfarin, with unmoni-
tored periods of supratherapeutic anticoagulation being
another potential contributor to higher rates of bleeding.
Our findings have particular relevance for those at high
baseline risk of ocular bleeding. Massive intraocular hemor-
rhage in patients with exudate age-related macular degenera-
tion (AMD) is often associated with poor visual outcomes, and
previous data have demonstrated an increased risk in pa-
tients receiving warfarin therapy.6 Tilanus and colleagues6
found that a patient having AMD with an associated massive
intraocular bleed is 11.6 times more likely to be taking an oral
anticoagulant and has significantly worse posthemorrhage
visual acuity compared with controls. There is also an associ-
ated increased risk of subretinal hemorrhage in patients with
AMD receiving anticoagulation, which is also known to con-
fer a poorer visual prognosis.5 Furthermore, in a recent analy-
sis of 1165 participants in a cohort study within the Compari-
son of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials,
Ying and colleagues23 found that there was an increased risk
of retinal and subretinal hemorrhage in hypertensive pa-
tients receiving warfarin therapy, although this increased risk
was not noted in normotensive patients receiving anticoagu-
lation. To our knowledge, there are no previous reports in the
literature investigating the risk of intraocular and subretinal
bleedinginpatientsreceivingnoveloralanticoagulants.There-
fore, our findings have significant implications for treating
clinicians when considering patients with exudative AMD,
especially in those who have hypertension. Further studies are
required to better evaluate the role of novel oral anticoagula-
tion in these settings.
Each year, approximately 10% of patients receiving anti-
coagulant agents require treatment interruption for surgical
interventions.24 For routine ophthalmic operations, the con-
tinuation of anticoagulation agents has not been found to sig-
nificantly increase the risk of severe sight-threatening hem-
orrhagic complications; hence, cessation of these agents is
generally not recommended.25-27 However, there are a few
studies that have investigated the implications of novel oral
anticoagulant therapy during ocular surgery; while the rapid
onset and offset action of these agents is potentially advanta-
geous, an understanding of the optimal cessation and recom-
mencement timing is critical to balance bleeding and throm-
botic risks.28 The Randomized Evaluation of Long-term
Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) study29 comparing dabiga-
tran with warfarin was the only trial included in this meta-
analysis that reported bleeding outcomes in patients who
underwent cataract surgery. Of the 800 patients treated with
dabigatran and 400 patients treated with warfarin, 9.3%
underwent cataract surgery during the trial period, and nei-
ther group had associated significant bleeding complica-
tions, although this study was not specifically designed or
powered to evaluate periprocedural bleeding. A small study30
of 36 patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery maintained on
a regiment of novel oral anticoagulants found no associated
increased risk of perioperative complications, while high-
risk oculoplastic procedures, such as dacryocystorhinos-
tomyanddeeporbitalandextensiveeyelidsurgery,requireces-
sation of novel oral anticoagulant therapy 48 hours before
surgery.28,31 Data from the present analyses raise the possibil-
ity that novel oral anticoagulants may also be superior to war-
farin in the perioperative period. Furthermore, the recent de-
velopment of previously unavailable reversal agents for novel
oral anticoagulants now counters this one advantage that war-
farin once had.32 However, additional clinical experience and
data are still required to characterize the optimal manage-
ment strategies when novel oral anticoagulant–associated
intraocular bleeding occurs.
Limitations
Our study has some limitations that warrant recognition.
First, intraocular bleeding is uncommon; therefore, the total
number of events in any individual trial was low. The pooling
of trials in this meta-analysis was thus required to demon-
strate a significant lower risk of intraocular bleeding with
novel oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin. Second,
we did not have access to individual patient data, which may

 which the benefits of novel oral anticoagulants may be more
pronounced, such as those with preexisting ophthalmic dis-
ease. Third, the short follow-up of included trials precludes
any assessment of the long-term intraocular bleeding risks of
novel oral anticoagulants. Observational data from registries
may be more useful in this regard. Fourth, although we ob-
served no statistically significant difference in the risk of in-
traocular bleeding according to the indication for anticoagu-
lation or the type of novel oral anticoagulant, we cannot
exclude the possibility of a small difference that may be de-
monstrable with greater statistical power. Fifth, the protocol
for this systematic review and meta-analysis was not for-
mallyregistered;therefore,theobjectivesandmethodsarenot
publicly and explicitly prespecified.
Conclusions
Our data suggest that novel oral anticoagulants reduce the risk
of intraocular bleeding by approximately one-fifth compared
withwarfarin.Similarbenefitswereseeninbothpatientstreated
for atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Our data
have particular implications for patients at higher risk of spon-
taneous retinal and subretinal bleeding. These findings may
alsohaveimportantimplicationsintheperioperativeperiod,in
which the use of novel oral anticoagulants may be superior.
Future studies are required to better characterize the optimal
managementofpatientswithbothophthalmicdiseaseandcar-
diovascularcomorbiditiesrequiringtherapywithanticoagulants.
