USYNOPSIS: Groin pain is common in athletes 
who participate in multidirectional sports and has 
traditionally been considered a difficult problem 
to understand, diagnose, and manage. This may 
be due to sparse historical focus on this complex 
region in sports medicine. Until recently, there 
has been little agreement regarding terminol-
ogy, definitions, and classification of groin pain 
in athletes. This has made clear communication 
between clinicians difficult, and the results of 
research difficult to interpret and implement into 
practice. However, during the past decade, the field 
has evolved rapidly, and an evidence-based under-
standing is now emerging. This clinical commen-
tary discusses the clinical examination (subjective 
history, screening, physical examination); imaging; 
testing of impairments, function, and performance; 
and management of athletes with groin pain in 
an evidence-based framework. J Orthop Sports

roin pain is common in athletes participating in 
multidirectional sports. It is especially prevalent in 
the various football codes and in ice hockey, which 
involve repetitive and forceful hip movements, such as 
those that occur during high-intensity kicking, skating, and 
direction change.22,62,104 Traditionally, groin pain has been considered
has led to poor communication 
and research interpretation be-
tween clinicians. However, dur-
ing the past decade, the field has 
evolved and an evidence-based 
understanding is now emerg-
ing.33,94 Numerous groups around the 
world are working together to create clear 
terminology, provide information on the 
diagnostic accuracy of relevant clinical 
examination and imaging techniques, and 
improve the assessment of impairment, 
function, and performance to optimize 
management of athletes with groin pain.
The aim of this paper was to synthe-
size recent advances in the clinical exami-
nation, diagnostic imaging, and testing of 
athletes with groin pain. Furthermore, we 
describe how information from reliable 
and valid clinical examination, diagnos-
tic imaging, and testing of impairment, 
function, and performance can guide 
current evidence-based management of 
athletes with groin pain.
The clinical framework suggested 
in this commentary (FIGURE 1) is based 
on consensus between experts31,105 and 
reliable and valid investigations where 
available.9,36,58,83,86,92,98

derstanding concerning the underlying pa-
thology of pain originating from the pubic 
symphysis, adjacent bone, and many sur-
rounding musculotendinous attachments 
has caused controversies and disagree-
ments concerning diagnoses and terminol-
ogy.94 Furthermore, current improvements 
in understanding hip joint pathologies

the clinical examination and classification 
of groin pain more complex and compre-

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
History
G
roin pain is generally more 
common in male athletes,62,104 but 
some specific injuries, such as stress 
fractures in and around the pelvic ring, 
are more common in female athletes.23 In 
young, skeletally immature athletes, the 
pelvic apophyses are vulnerable to injury.74 
High-load activities, such as kicking and 
sprinting, may result in avulsion fractures, 
with the anterior inferior and superior 
iliac spines being the 2 most frequently 
injured locations.72,81 Additionally, as the 
pubic symphysis is the last part of the hu-
man skeleton to mature, pubic apophysi-
tis should be considered in the differential 
diagnosis of hip and groin pain in athletes 
as they age into their early twenties.74 Ad-
olescent athletes are also at increased risk 
of hip-related problems if they have a pre-
vious history of slipped capital femoral 
epiphysis,18 Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease,55 
or acetabular dysplasia. Hip-related groin 
pain is more likely to occur in mature ath-
letes starting in their early twenties,16,45 
and hip joint osteoarthritis (OA) as a 
cause of groin pain should also be consid-
ered in older athletes.16
Types of Sports and Injuries
Due to the high number of athletes com-
peting in multidirectional sports, such 
as football, many athletes with either 
acute strains or overuse injuries related 
to the groin region are seen in clinical 
practice. Acute strains often occur at the 
musculotendinous junction, specifically 
of the adductor longus, rectus femoris, 
and iliopsoas muscles.87,88 Acute adduc-
tor longus and rectus femoris injuries 
may also involve tendinous rupture/
avulsion, primarily at the proximal inser-
tions (FIGURE 2).87,88 In contrast to strains, 
groin overuse injuries more often involve 
bone and tendons and their insertions, 
and rarely involve the rectus femoris.34 
Acute adductor muscle injuries usually 
occur during kicking and change of di-
rection.84 In comparison, acute rectus 
femoris injuries primarily occur during 
kicking and sprinting, whereas acute 
iliacus and psoas major injuries mainly 
occur with movement requiring change 
of direction.88 Runners and dancers can 
also present with groin pain, often due 
to overuse. Hip flexor injuries, hip joint 
pain, and stress fractures are the most 
common injuries seen in these individ-
uals,8,43,47,66 and, like most other overuse 
injuries, these are more often related to 
repetitive and accumulated overload.

Screening for Serious Pathology  
Causing Groin Pain
Evidence supporting diagnostically accu-
rate red flag signs and symptoms in the 
groin region is limited21 and inconsistent 
across current practice guidelines.48 Still, 
clinicians must be aware of abdominal 
and pelvic organ disorders mimicking 
musculoskeletal-related groin pain.15 A 
history of cancer, such as prostate can-
cer in men, breast cancer in women, or 
cancer in any reproductive organs, is a 
potential red flag, as it is associated with 
metastases in the hip and groin region.32 
Other red flags of concern are history of 
trauma, fever, unexplained weight loss, 
painful urination, night pain, and pro-
longed corticosteroid use.29,51,100
Serious pathology causing groin pain 
includes avascular necrosis, femoral neck 
fracture, or femoral shaft stress fracture. 
Information on screening for avascular 
necrosis is limited, but it has been suggest-
ed that having normal hip range of motion 
(ROM) is helpful in ruling out this condi-
tion.42 The patella-pubic percussion test 
(sensitivity, 95%; negative likelihood ratio 
= 0.07) and fulcrum test (sensitivity, 88%; 
negative likelihood ratio = 0.92) provide 
good to limited clinical utility to help rule 
out femoral neck fractures and femoral 
shaft stress fractures, respectively.68
If there is suspicion of serious under-
lying pathology, specific imaging should 
always be performed. Plain radiographs 
are a good primary examination to detect 
neoplasms in the skeleton. Even in seem-
ingly healthy athletes, this should be con-
sidered for unexplained or long-standing 
groin pain not improving with treatment. 
If a stress fracture is considered, radio-
graphs are frequently negative, especially 
in the early stages, and therefore cannot 
be used to rule out these injuries.17,47 Al-
ternatively, magnetic resonance imag-
ing (MRI), which visualizes bone stress 
reactions at an earlier stage, especially 
in high-risk sites, is therefore recom-
mended.17,47 In the skeletally immature 
adolescent athlete, plain radiographs are 
used to detect osseous avulsions in mus-
culotendinous distraction injuries, avas-
cular necrosis, and epiphysiolysis of the 
femoral neck.6,30
Physical Examination
Once serious pathology has been ruled 
out, the clinician should screen for poten-
tial lumbar spine– and sacroiliac joint–
related pathology using subjective history 
and clinical examination tests that are 
highly sensitive. A lack of peripheraliza-
tion or centralization (sensitivity, 92%; 
negative likelihood ratio = 0.12) of the 
athlete’s symptoms with repeated lumbar 
spine ROM testing and negative straight 
leg raise (sensitivity, 97%; negative like-
lihood ratio = 0.05) and slump testing 
(sensitivity, 83%; negative likelihood ratio 
= 0.32) assist with ruling out the poten-
tial existence of discogenic/radiculopathy 
pathology.19,101 Facet joint pathology is 
best ruled out with a negative extension-
rotation test (sensitivity, 100%; negative 
likelihood ratio = 0.00).50,82 Despite the 
controversial nature of sacroiliac joint pa-
thology testing, the thigh thrust test has 
good clinical utility to rule out (sensitivity, 
88%; negative likelihood ratio = 0.18) po-
tential sacroiliac joint pathology.49
The Doha agreement regarding the 
examination of athletes with groin pain 
suggests classifying athletes according 
to certain clinical entities based on pain-
provocation tests.34,36,105 Tenderness with 
palpation is present in the defined clinical 
entities of adductor-, pubic-, inguinal-, 
and iliopsoas-related groin pain (TABLE). 
Tenderness with palpation denotes the 
presence of recognizable pain related to 
anatomical structures encompassed by 
the specific entity (FIGURE 3).105 The same 
applies to resistance testing of the adduc-
tors, where the pain must be felt in the 
adductor region to be classified as being 
adductor-related groin pain.105 Good in-
traobserver and interobserver agreement 
for this approach (κ ≥0.70)36 has been 
documented. New studies examining the 
accuracy of the clinical examination of 
pain-provocation tests using palpation, 
stretch, and resistance testing in ath-
letes with acute groin injuries have been 
published since the Doha agreement 
meeting.84,86 These studies demonstrate 
that clinical examination is accurate in 
locating acute injuries to the adductors, 
generally with an accuracy greater than 
90% for the various adductor tests.86 For 
acute hip flexor injuries, it can sometimes 
be hard to distinguish between iliopsoas 
or proximal rectus femoris involvement 
based on clinical findings. The accuracy 
of the different hip flexor tests is not 
much better than flipping a coin.86 Im-
portantly, absence of palpation pain in 
the adductors and hip flexors has the 
highest predictive value for ruling out 
acute injury in these structures, with an 
accuracy greater than 90%.86
Hip-related intra-articular pathology 
is a possible cause of groin pain in ath-
letes.31 Clinical tests work best as screen-
ing tests, with negative tests assisting in 
ruling out intra-articular hip pathology. 
A positive test can only indicate the need 
for further investigation of the hip.67,68 To 
further elucidate actual intra-articular 
injury, diagnostic imaging is necessary to 
corroborate the athlete’s symptoms and 
the clinical findings.69 This approach was 
established by a panel of specialists and 
formulated in the 2016 Warwick Agree-
ment on femoroacetabular impingement 
(FAI) syndrome. Femoroacetabular im-
pingement syndrome was defined as a 
motion-related clinical hip disorder with 
a triad of symptoms, clinical signs, and 
imaging findings.31 The primary symp-
toms of FAI syndrome are motion- or 
position-related pain in the hip or groin 
region,31 with potential clicking, catching, 
locking, stiffness, restricted hip ROM, or 
giving way (TABLE).
Therefore, current best evidence sup-
ports a comprehensive examination (eg, 
subjective history, screening, physical 
examination) of the entire groin region 
for athletes presenting with groin pain 
(FIGURE 1).

ruling out of serious pathology? When 
serious pathology is not suspected, the 
guidelines from the Doha agreement clas-
sification system are useful.105 For athletes 
with symptoms and clinical findings who 
can readily be classified into 1 or more of 
the 4 defined clinical entities (TABLE, FIGURE 
3), there is currently no available evidence 
to suggest an improvement of diagnostic 
or prognostic indicators with imaging.11 
Additionally, inappropriate and excessive 
use of imaging can be problematic, be-
cause morphology alone does not equate 
to pathology.10,26 The consequence of un-
necessary imaging is that athletes may fo-
cus on these normal morphological tissue 
changes, which may make them fearful of 
movement and exercise and impede effec-
tive treatment.
Imaging for Pubic- and Adductor-Related 
Groin Pain
Abnormal imaging findings around the 
pubic symphysis are commonly reported 
in athletes with adductor- and pubic-re-
lated groin pain.11 Many of these findings, 
such as low-grade pubic bone marrow 
edema, are also found in asymptomatic 
athletes.10 In football players with and 
without groin pain, only higher grades of 
pubic bone marrow edema and a protru-
sion of the symphyseal joint disc were as-
sociated with pain.10 Pubic bone marrow 
edema can be described as a bone stress 
reaction, as histologic analyses of bone bi-
opsies show no signs of inflammation.102 
Therefore, the diagnostic term “osteitis 
pubis” is not recommended based on 
current evidence. Whether a higher pu-
bic bone marrow edema severity grading 
is associated with a longer rehabilitation 
time has never been reported, but can-
not be discarded. Based on current evi-
dence of imaging findings in relation to 
the symphysis joint and the adjacent pu-
bic bone, clinicians need to consider age, 
type of sport, loading, and the athlete’s 
presenting symptoms when interpreting 
these imaging findings. In adolescents, 
pubic- or adductor-related groin pain 
could be due to apophysitis.74 This is an 
important differential diagnostic consid-
eration, as the mainstay of treatment is 
supervised load management. The best 
imaging modality to show the apophyses 
is computed tomography, a modality not 
recommended for young athletes due to 
the high dose of ionizing radiation. In-

stead, age, location of the pain at the ad-
ductor insertion on the pubic bone, and 
uncharacteristic worsening of pain with 
adductor exercises should make one con-
sider this diagnosis.
Imaging may be considered to deter-
mine the initial severity of acute adductor 
muscle strains. Avulsion injuries account 
for a high proportion of injuries at the 
proximal adductor longus insertion,87 
and these injuries generally have a lon-
ger rehabilitation time than lower-grade 
injuries.79,107 Therefore, if an avulsion is 
suspected, ultrasonography or MRI can 
be used for confirmation.84,86 In athletes 
with long-standing adductor-related 
groin pain, ultrasonography is often the 
imaging modality of choice.35
Imaging for Inguinal-Related Groin Pain
In inguinal-related groin pain, ultraso-
nography is also most often the imaging 
of choice, used as part of the diagnostic 
process. One proposed etiology of in-
guinal-related pain is that posterior ab-
dominal wall weakness leads to bulging 
of abdominal structures that compresses 
the genital branch of the genitofemoral 
nerve.14 This weakness can sometimes 
be visualized through dynamic ultra-
sonography. However, bulging alone has 
not been associated with groin pain, and 
there is a high risk of false-positive find-
ings due to the high prevalence of bulg-
ing in asymptomatic athletes.63 Currently, 
there is no evidence on the validity or re-
producibility of these ultrasonography 
imaging findings,11,63 and therefore ul-
trasonography findings in athletes with 
inguinal-related groin pain should be 
interpreted with caution.
Imaging for Iliopsoas-Related Groin Pain
In athletes with groin pain, diagnosing 
iliopsoas-related groin pain can some-
times be difficult,84 as widespread pain 
can result in multiple positive clinical 
examination tests.86 Magnetic resonance 
imaging or ultrasonography may there-
fore be helpful to improve accuracy in 
the initial diagnosis,7,59 although evidence 
regarding the therapeutic or prognostic 
relevance of such findings is currently 
lacking.
Imaging for Hip-Related Groin Pain
In hip-related groin pain, there are several 
cases where imaging may assist in the di-
agnosis.67,68,71 As previously mentioned, as-
sessment of radiological measures of cam 
and/or pincer morphology is required for 
the diagnosis of FAI syndrome.31 Initial 
diagnostic imaging should therefore in-
clude an anteroposterior radiograph of 
the pelvis and a lateral femoral-neck view 
to examine bony hip morphology and 
determine the presence of other possible 
sources of hip-related groin pain.31
In prospective studies, the presence 
of acetabular dysplasia and the presence 
of cam morphology are associated with 
an up to 5-fold2 and 10-fold1,61 increased 
risk of OA development, respectively, in 
middle-aged cohorts presenting with hip 
pain. Large cam morphology, defined as 
an alpha angle greater than 78°, has been 
identified as the threshold best distin-
guishing hips that proceed to develop OA.3 
In contrast, it appears that the presence of 
a pincer deformity may have a protective 
effect against the development of OA.3,73 
Whether these findings can be extrapolat-
ed to athletes younger than 40 years of age 
is currently unknown. In older athletes, 
hip OA should always be considered and 
is clinically indicated by hip flexion of 115° 
or less and hip internal rotation less than 
15°, and radiographically verified as joint 
space narrowing or presence of femoral or 
acetabular osteophytes.5
If further assessment of morphology, 
cartilage, or labral injury is warranted, 
then cross-sectional imaging is appro-
priate, preferably using 3.0-T MRI.3,31 
In accordance with the Warwick Agree-
ment31 and other work,70 we also suggest 
that imaging findings of intra-articular 
pathology be matched with clinical ex-
amination findings and the athlete’s 
symptoms before a specific diagnosis is 
provided under the umbrella of hip-relat-
ed groin pain.
Based on the many false-positive find-
ings and the lack of understanding be-
tween the specific underlying pathology 
and its specific manifestation on imaging, 
utilizing imaging as the main guide for 
treatment is not recommended. How-
ever, as previously mentioned, imaging 
has a role in detecting serious pathology, 
and may in some cases also serve to give 
more credence to the diagnostic work-up

process if it matches clinical signs and 
symptoms.
IMPAIRMENT AND  
FUNCTION TESTING
M
ost athletes with groin pain 
are able to continue training for 
several months prior to pain forc-
ing them to discontinue their sport.93 
Continuing to train and play with groin 
pain can result in movement compen-
sation strategies, resulting in decreased 
function and performance.24,27,41,56,57,93
Therefore, in addition to the use of 
pain-provocation tests,69,92 joint ROM, 
muscle strength, function, and perfor-
mance must be systematically assessed 
(FIGURE 4)69 and the appropriate patient-
reported outcome measures must be 
completed (FIGURE 5).69
Hip ROM
There is conflicting evidence on whether 
athletes with groin pain have impairments 
in ROM compared to controls.46,57,90 A re-
cent systematic review examining impair-
ments in athletes reported no significant 
differences in ROM between athletes with 
FAI syndrome and healthy controls.28 The 
clinical value of including hip ROM still 
remains uncertain. If clearly measurable 
side-to-side differences or changes be-
tween test and retest exist (greater than 
5°),90 then this could potentially inform 
individually targeted management strat-
egies.31 However, it is important to un-
derstand whether ROM restrictions are 
caused by bony morphology or are the 
consequence of underlying chondral sta-
tus and/or protective muscle guarding.
Hip Muscle Strength
Decreased hip muscle strength seems to 
be a consistent finding in athletes with 
groin pain.46,57 Hip muscle strength defi-
cits have been demonstrated in athletes 
with adductor- and pubic-related groin 
pain,53,93 and in individuals with hip-re-
lated groin pain, FAI syndrome, or after 
having hip arthroscopy, often for several 
hip movement planes.20 In particular, 
reduced hip adduction strength is com-
monly reported in athletes with groin 
pain46 and is important to target through 
rehabilitation. Athletes with adductor- 
and pubic-related groin pain have also 
shown reduced hip abduction and ab-
dominal muscle strength.46,57
Objective measurements of hip 
strength in all planes of motion are 
therefore important. When using hand-
held dynamometry, results can either be 
interpreted based on published norma-
tive values for specific populations (types 
of athletes)58 or in comparison with the 
unaffected limb in individuals with uni-
lateral presentations.58 When compar-
ing to the unaffected side, a lower-limb 
symmetry index can then be calculated 
by dividing the strength of the affected 
limb by the unaffected limb. In addition, 
ratios between agonist and antagonist 
hip muscle groups have been reported 
for athletes with and without groin pain, 
providing additional reference criteria 
for measuring progress.58,93,97,99 Clinically, 
changes/differences in muscle strength 
greater than 15% to 20% can be reliably 
measured across all movement directions 
of the hip when using the same tester.96

Interestingly, deficits greater than 20% 
for adductors and abdominals have been 
frequently documented in athletes with 
adductor- and pubic-related pain.53,60,77,93 
Adductor squeeze strength testing is a 
very precise clinical measure.52,53 In ath-
letes with adductor- and pubic-related 
pain, a numeric pain rating (0-10) can be 
obtained simultaneously,108 and the test is 
a quick, valid indicator of hip- and groin-
specific sports function.92
Function and Physical Performance
The use of the single-leg stance, single-
leg squat, and the Star Excursion Bal-
ance Test for athletes with hip pathology 
is supported by a recent systematic re-
view.20 However, functional and physical 
performance deficits have not been con-
sistently reported in athletes unless clear 
hip pathology or a history of hip surgery 
is present.109 In athletes without clear 
hip pathology or a history of hip sur-
gery, decreased functional performance 
has only been documented in labora-
tory settings, using 3-D motion analy-
sis, showing changes and differences in 
kinematics during movements requiring 
changes of direction.24,27 Although these 
results are intriguing, it is not yet clear 
how clinically applicable these kinematic 
measures are and how they relate to man-
agement. Performance measures that in-
clude actual cutting time, however, seem 
promising, as cutting functionally relates 
to pelvic lateral tilt range and lateral tho-
rax rotation.54 In addition, cutting-time 
testing is reliable and possible in most 
clinical settings.54 More research is, how-
ever, needed prior to suggesting the wide-
spread, standard clinical implementation 
of performance-related tests for athletes 
with groin pain that is not hip related.
Patient-Reported Outcome Measures
Athletes with groin pain demonstrate 
substantial reductions in self-reported 
questionnaire scores on pain, physical 
function, participation/performance, and 
quality of life.76,93 Both the Copenhagen 
Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS) 
and the international Hip Outcome Tool 
are reliable, valid, and responsive mea-
sures for patients with hip and/or groin 
pain.98 Both of these measures have re-
cently been translated and validated in 
different languages and by different re-
search groups, and reference values have 
been provided in different subgroups.98 
The HAGOS has been translated into 14 
languages and is easily accessible and free 
of charge (www.koos.nu). Standard and 
repeated completion of the HAGOS and/
or the international Hip Outcome Tool 
can help evaluate progress and guide the 
treatment plan. Clinically, changes of 10 
to 30 points can be measured at the indi-
vidual level, depending on specific patient 
population and the subscale used.91,95 
Such changes also exceed the minimal 
important change,91,95 and most athletes 
with groin pain will seek treatment when 
their HAGOS scores for sports-related 
function and participation/performance 
are less than 50 points on a 100-point 
scale, where 100 points indicates perfect 
function.76,93
EVIDENCE-BASED 
MANAGEMENT
A
t present, there is limited evi-
dence based on clinical trials com-
paring nonsurgical to surgical 
interventions for groin pain in athletes, 
but a recent systematic review has indi-
cated that nonsurgical and surgical in-
terventions have similar return-to-play 
times.44 We therefore generally recom-
mend nonsurgical management as the 
first line of treatment for athletes with 
hip and groin pain. This less invasive op-
tion will in many cases result in satisfac-
tory results.
Athletes With Adductor- and  
Pubic-Related Groin Pain
For athletes with adductor-related groin 
pain, there is level 1 evidence that a su-
pervised active approach to rehabilita-
tion, including physical training, results 
in a higher success of return to play when 
compared to the use of passive physical 
therapy modalities.39 The use of adjunct 
treatments, such as manual adductor ma-
nipulation or shockwave therapy, in addi-
tion to exercises seems to result in a faster 
return to play,80,106 but not higher overall 
treatment success, than a supervised ac-
tive physical training program alone.39 
Around 50% to 75% of athletes with 
adductor-related groin pain will return 
to their previous pain-free level of activ-
ity using a general exercise approach.39,106 
Monitoring of impairment, function, and 
performance can help individualize the 
plan of care. For athletes with adductor- 
and pubic-related groin pain, hip adduc-
tor and abductor muscle strength, as well 
as abdominal muscle strength, is impor-
tant to monitor for optimal loading in 
the rehabilitation program. In refractory 
cases, level 2 evidence suggests that par-
tial surgical release of the adductor lon-
gus tendon may be effective for returning 
athletes to preinjury level.78 Weakness of 
the adductors is a possible consequence 
of adductor tenotomy,4 and tenotomy 
should therefore be avoided if possible. 
Athletes with adductor-related groin 
pain and cam morphology on imaging 
have a good long-term prognosis using an 
exercise-based rehabilitation program.38 
Therefore, imaging findings of cam 
morphology appear less important in 
athletes with adductor-related groin pain 
than in athletes with hip-related groin 
pain. The clinical difference between 
adductor-related and pubic-related pain 
in the current literature seems mini-
mal.10,11,25,39,80,89,103,106 Therefore, pubic-re-
lated pain should be treated in a manner 
similar to adductor-related groin pain.
Athletes With Inguinal-Related  
Groin Pain
For athletes with inguinal-related groin 
pain, laparoscopic hernia surgery has 
been shown to result in lower pain and a 
higher percentage returning to play than 
nonsurgical treatment in a randomized 
controlled trial.64 However, as nonsurgi-
cal treatment with exercises and injec-
tions showed some promise, with 50% of 
participants fully recovered after 1 year 
in this randomized controlled trial,64 we

advise a nonoperative approach first, 
given the risk of possible surgical com-
plications. Again, monitoring hip adduc-
tor, hip abductor, and abdominal muscle 
strength is relevant in relation to individ-
ual weaknesses in these patients.46
Athletes With Iliopsoas-Related  
Groin Pain
There is no high-level evidence to support 
or refute the use of exercise or other non-
surgical treatments to address iliopsoas-
related groin pain. We therefore propose 
to base treatment on impairments and 
functional deficits. Because arthroscopic 
iliopsoas release or tenotomy results in il-
iopsoas atrophy with substantial volume 
loss and reduced hip flexion strength,12 
surgery is not recommended as first-line 
treatment. Iliopsoas-related groin pain 
can coexist with hip-related groin pain,65 
and any issues related to impairments 
in hip flexion strength may need to be 
addressed.
Athletes With Hip-Related Groin Pain
Suggested management strategies for 
hip-related groin pain (specifically FAI 
syndrome) include rehabilitation (eg, 
physical therapy programs), medica-
tion, and surgery (particularly arthros-
copy).31 There is no high-level evidence 
supporting the superiority of any single 
approach. Therefore, the best available 
evidence to guide appropriate physical 
therapy treatment for hip-related groin 
pain involves targeting characteristic im-
pairments seen in hip-related groin pain, 
such as hip and trunk strength, function, 
and performance.20,28
Athletes With Multiple Entities
As athletes with groin pain often present 
with multiple entities,34,37 specific atten-
tion toward impairments, function, and 
performance can be helpful. In these 
athletes, the most prominent deficits can 
be identified by clinical testing. It is ad-
visable to direct treatment toward these 
deficits first, and then monitor how this 
affects the clinical signs and symptoms. 
Sound clinical reasoning and systematic 
testing using the evidence-based instru-
ments provided in this clinical commen-
tary are also recommended for these 
athletes.
CONCLUSION
T
his clinical commentary high-
lights an evidence-based examina-
tion and management approach to 
athletes with groin pain based on science 
and consensus among clinical experts 
around the world. Further improve-
ments are needed in relation to nonsur-
gical and surgical management—and the 
timing of these management approaches. 
Such progress is now easier due to better 
clinical differentiation and management 
strategies being reported. U
