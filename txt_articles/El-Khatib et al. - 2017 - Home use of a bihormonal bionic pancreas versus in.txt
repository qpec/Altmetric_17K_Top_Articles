 reduce mean glycaemia and hypoglycaemia in adults with type 1 diabetes who were living at 
home and participating in their normal daily routines without restrictions on diet or physical 
activity.
Methods—We did a random-order crossover study in volunteers at least 18 years old who had 
type 1 diabetes and lived within a 30 min drive of four sites in the USA. Participants were 
randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of two using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes to 
glycaemic regulation with a bihormonal bionic pancreas or usual care (conventional or sensor-
augmented insulin pump therapy) first, followed by the opposite intervention. Both study periods 
were 11 days in length, during which time participants continued all normal activities, including 
athletics and driving. The bionic pancreas was initialised with only the participant’s body mass. 
Autonomously adaptive dosing algorithms used data from a continuous glucose monitor to control 
subcutaneous delivery of insulin and glucagon. The coprimary outcomes were the mean glucose 
concentration and time with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) glucose concentration less 
than 3·3 mmol/L, analysed over days 2–11 in participants who completed both periods of the 
study. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02092220.
Findings—We randomly assigned 43 participants between May 6, 2014, and July 3, 2015, 39 of 
whom completed the study: 20 who were assigned to bionic pancreas first and 19 who were 
assigned to the comparator first. The mean CGM glucose concentration was 7·8 mmol/L (SD 0·6) 
in the bionic pancreas period versus 9·0 mmol/L (1·6) in the comparator period (difference 1·1 
mmol/L, 95% CI 0·7–1·6; p<0·0001), and the mean time with CGM glucose concentration less 
than 3·3 mmol/L was 0·6% (0·6) in the bionic pancreas period versus 1·9% (1·7) in the comparator 
period (difference 1·3%, 95% CI 0·8–1·8; p<0·0001). The mean nausea score on the Visual 
Analogue Scale (score 0–10) was greater during the bionic pancreas period (0·52 [SD 0·83]) than 
in the comparator period (0·05 [0·17]; difference 0·47, 95% CI 0·21–0·73; p=0·0024). Body mass 
and laboratory parameters did not differ between periods. There were no serious or unexpected 
adverse events in the bionic pancreas period of the study.
Interpretation—Relative to conventional and sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy, the 
bihormonal bionic pancreas, initialised only with participant weight, was able to achieve superior 
glycaemic regulation without the need for carbohydrate counting. Larger and longer studies are 
needed to establish the long-term benefits and risks of automated glycaemic management with a 
bihormonal bionic pancreas.

Introduction
People with type 1 diabetes are at risk of life-threatening acute and chronic complications. 
Maintaining mean blood glucose concentrations near the non-diabetic range prevents 
complications of type 1 diabetes and reduces mortality.1–3 However, most people with type 1 
diabetes are not able to maintain mean blood glucose in this range,4–6 and intensifying 
treatment to achieve therapeutic goals increases the risk of both symptomatic and life-
threatening hypoglycaemia.7–11 Current treatments need painstaking effort by patients to 
count carbohydrates, closely monitor blood glucose, and make dosing decisions for insulin, 
a drug with a narrow therapeutic range and a low margin for error. An unmet need exists for

 better methods to manage glycaemia. We have investigated a strategy to automate glycaemic 
management with a bihormonal bionic pancreas that uses continuous glucose monitoring 
(CGM) and mathematical algorithms to automatically administer both insulin and 
glucagon.12–19
We have previously done day-and-night 5-day studies with a bihormonal bionic pancreas in 
outpatient settings.17, 18 Findings from these studies showed significantly reduced mean 
glucose concentrations and hypoglycaemia or the need to treat hypoglycaemia versus usual 
care in participants aged 6–76 years.17, 18 The bionic pancreas was initialised only with the 
participant body mass; there were no restrictions on diet or exercise, and meal 
announcements did not require carbohydrate counting. However, in the adult study,17 
participants stayed in a hotel at night and had in-person monitoring by study staff during the 
day, and the studies in children17, 18 took place in a diabetes camp setting.
Several randomised, controlled day-and-night outpatient studies have tested various insulin-
only artificial pancreas systems for between 40 h and 12 weeks.20, 25 These studies were 
done in a supervised hotel-based setting,20 a diabetes camp,21 or in a unsupervised free-
living home setting.23–25 In all of these studies, the artificial pancreas systems were 
initialised with information from each participant’s insulin regimen and required 
carbohydrate counting. Participants in two of the three home studies used the insulin-only 
artificial pancreas for 7 days and were restricted in their use of the artificial pancreas during 
vigorous exercise.23, 24 However, in the longest of these studies,25 lasting 12 weeks, 
participants had no restrictions on exercise after the first 2 weeks. Findings from this study 
showed increased time in the target blood glucose concentration range, decreased mean 
glucose concentration, and reduced hypoglycaemia exposure compared with sensor-
augmented pump (SAP) treatment.25 In two studies26, 27 of a bihormonal artificial pancreas 
administering insulin and glucagon, participants were allowed to go home after an inpatient 
period of optimisation: for 2 days in one26 and for 3 days in the other.27 Diet and exercise 
were not restricted and no meal announcements were required. However, the system was 
initialised with a personalised insulin sensitivity factor that could be adjusted daily during 
the experiment by the investigators, and neither study showed improvements in the primary 
outcomes—time in target blood glucose concentration range26 or median glucose 
concentration27— relative to conventional insulin pump (CIP) treatment.
We did a multicentre, randomised, crossover trial to assess whether the bihormonal bionic 
pancreas initialised only with body mass can safely reduce both mean glycaemia and 
hypoglycaemia in adult volunteers with type 1 diabetes who were following their usual 
routines in a home-use setting without restrictions on diet or physical activity.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did this random-order crossover study at four sites in the USA: Massachusetts General 
Hospital (Boston, MA), University of Massachusetts Medical School (Worcester, MA), 
Stanford University (Palo Alto, CA), and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 
(Chapel Hill, NC). All participants were at least 18 years old, had type 1 diabetes for at least

 1 year, and were on insulin pump treatment for at least 6 months. They were required to 
work or study at one of the participating campuses and to live within a 30 min drive-time 
radius. Each participant had a designated contact at least 18 years old who lived with them 
and was willing to receive calls from the study staff regarding the participant’s welfare. The 
appendix (p 3) lists other eligibility and exclusion criteria.
The protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at each centre. All participants 
and designated contacts gave written informed consent before participation in the study.
Randomisation and masking
Participants completed two 11-day study periods in random order, during which they used 
the bihormonal bionic pancreas (intervention period) or their own insulin pump (and CGM if 
they used one) according to their usual practice (comparator period). Participants were 
randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of two using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes 
produced by MAH and opened in the same order by KLM when participants were deemed 
eligible. Allocation assignment was not masked. Further details of masking are provided in 
the Procedures section. There was a washout period of 3 days or 10 days between study 
periods, depending on local scheduling constraints. Each study period included an in-person 
start-up visit on day 1, a shutdown visit on day 11, and two brief check-in calls on days 4 
and 8.
Procedures
As described previously,17, 18 the bihormonal bionic pancreas used for automatic 
administration of insulin and glucagon consisted of an iPhone 4S (Apple, Cupertino, CA, 
USA) connected to a G4 Platinum CGM (Dexcom, San Diego, CA, USA). The insulin and 
glucagon control algorithms used were identical to the ones used in our previous study.18 
These algorithms are similar to those used in our other previous studies,14–17 with the 
additional refinement of incorporating into the insulin dosing algorithm a feedback effect of 
the total glucagon dosing. The control algorithm and user interface ran as an app on the 
iPhone. The user interface allowed optional meal announcements, designated as “breakfast”, 
“lunch”, or “dinner”, of size “typical”, “more than typical”, “less than typical”, or “a small 
bite”. Participants were suggested, but not required, to use this feature immediately before 
eating the main meals of the day, but not snacks. Use of this feature triggered a partial meal-
priming bolus that automatically adapted towards 75% of the 4 h prandial insulin need for 
that meal size and type. The first meal-priming bolus for each meal type, before adaptation, 
was based on body mass. For a “typical” meal the first weight-based meal-priming bolus 
was 0·05 U/kg. The meal-priming bolus was a third of that for a “typical” meal for a “small 
bite”, two-thirds for “less than typical”, and one and a third for “more than typical”. The 
bionic pancreas used two t:slim infusion pumps (Tandem Diabetes Care, San Diego, CA, 
USA) to deliver subcutaneous doses of insulin and glucagon up to every 5 min through 
insulin infusion sets (appendix p 15).
System initialisation was based solely on the participant’s body mass, without information 
about the usual insulin regimen. The bionic pancreas adapted dosing to each participant’s 
needs automatically. When CGM data were not available, the bionic pancreas invoked

 automatic basal insulin dosing on the basis of mean basal dosing delivered at corresponding 
times on previous days. Automatic correction doses of insulin or glucagon were delivered in 
response to manually entered blood glucose measurements that the system requested once 
per hour when CGM data were unavailable. No insulin was given other than by the bionic 
pancreas. Patients were asked not to use acetaminophen because of interference with CGM 
performance.28, 29
During the comparator period, all participants carried the CGM and iPhone portion of the 
bionic pancreas set to a mode in which CGM data were collected but not displayed to the 
participant, allowing collection of CGM data and remote telemetric monitoring for 
hypoglycaemia without altering their usual method of glycaemic management. During the 
comparator period, participants were also encouraged to use their own unmasked CGM, in 
addition to the masked study CGM, if that was part of their usual approach to glycaemic 
management (ie, if their usual care treatment was SAP). In both study periods, whenever 
CGM glucose concentrations were less than 2·8 mmol/L for more than 15 min, study staff 
were alerted and telephoned the participant to alert them. Remote telemetric monitoring was 
otherwise masked to glucose concentrations and to the actions of the bionic pancreas. In the 
bionic pancreas period, telemetric monitoring alerted study staff when the CGM or pumps 
were disconnected for 15 min, prompting a phone call to the participant for troubleshooting. 
Participants were instructed to send a text message to the monitor before driving, which 
changed the threshold for alerts from less than 2·8 mmol/L to less than 3·3 mmol/L during 
the trip. Participants calibrated the CGM twice daily using the StatStrip Xpress meter (Nova 
Biomedical, Waltham, MA, USA) and used this meter for all plasma glucose measurements 
in both study periods. Participants were asked to take capillary plasma glucose 
measurements at least four times daily.
During both treatment periods, participants used their usual insulin analogue and changed 
insulin infusion sets every 2 days. During the bionic pancreas period, participants 
reconstituted glucagon (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and used a new pump cartridge, 
tubing, and infusion set daily.
No restrictions were placed on diet or exercise. Participants were asked to limit alcohol 
intake to no more than two drinks in 1 h or four drinks in 1 day. Participants completed a 
questionnaire each evening via an automated email regarding the previous 24 h, including 
symptomatic hypoglycaemia, carbohydrate treatments for hypoglycaemia, and any nausea 
(intensity on a 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale, answers could be 0 or whole integers 1–10; 
appendix p 4).
At the start and end of each treatment period, body mass and blood pressure were measured 
and blood was taken for a chemistry panel and a complete blood count (appendix p 3).
Outcomes
The coprimary outcomes were the mean CGM glucose concentration and the time with 
CGM glucose concentration less than 3·3 mmol/L during days 2–11 in each period. 
Although the bionic pancreas continues to adapt beyond day 1, glycaemic data collected on

 days 2–11 are expected to be more representative of long-term system performance than day 
1 data.16–18
Secondary outcomes included the percentage of time CGM glucose concentrations were in 
clinically relevant ranges (<2·8 mmol/L, <3·9 mmol/L, 3·9–10·0 mmol/L, and >10·0 
mmol/L); number of symptomatic hypoglycaemic events; number of carbohydrate 
interventions for hypoglycaemia; and amount of carbohydrates taken for treatment of 
hypoglycaemia (appendix p 4). All glycaemic outcome measures derived from CGM data 
were calculated for the full 24 h period and for the night-time period (2300 h to 0700 h). The 
number of participants with a mean CGM glucose concentration 8·6 mmol/L or lower 
(secondary endpoint) was also calculated because this is the estimated mean glucose 
concentration that corresponds to a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 7·0%.30–32 Other 
secondary outcomes were insulin and glucagon total daily dose.
Safety outcomes were nausea reported on the daily surveys, change in body mass, and 
change in laboratory measurements from the beginning to end of each study period (days 1–
11).
Statistical analysis
In our previous outpatient study in adults,17 the difference between the mean CGM glucose 
concentration in the bionic pancreas and usual care periods was 1·4 mmol/L (bionic 
pancreas mean 7·4 mmol/L [ SD 0·7] vs usual care 8·8 mmol/L [1·7]) and the difference in 
time with CGM glucose concentration less than 3·3 mmol/L was 2·2% (1·5% [1·7] vs 3·7% 
[3·3], SD of the difference 3·7%). The sample size needed to detect the same difference in 
time with CGM glucose concentration less than 3·3 mmol/L with a power of 95% and a 
significance level of 5% using a one-sided paired t test assuming a SD of 4% to be 
conservative was 38 participants. This number of participants was predicted to provide more 
than 99% power to detect the difference in mean CGM found in the previous study17 using 
the same statistical method. This sample size was larger than that needed to detect the 
previously observed difference in mean CGM glucose. We aimed to have ten participants 
complete the study at each of the four sites and we replaced participants who withdrew.
All data from participants who completed both periods of the study, including data from 
periods when the bionic pancreas was not in use, were included in the analyses. Data were 
analysed using Excel for Mac 2011 (version 14.7.0) and SAS (version 9.4). We used the 
paired t test to compare study periods, and report two-sided p values. For the two coprimary 
outcomes, we used a repeated measures model allowing within-patient random effects fitted 
using the generalised estimating equations method to analyse the period and treatment main 
effects, and used the interaction between them to test for a carryover effect. We also used 
multivariable models to analyse the effect, in separate analyses (one variable per analysis) of 
study site, participant age, duration of diabetes, baseline HbA1c concentration, insulin total 
daily dose, and CGM use in the comparator period. For analysis of laboratory measures, we 
used the paired sample Student’s t test to establish whether the difference from the 
beginning to the end of each period was different between the two periods. Additionally, we 
used the Wilcoxon signed rank test to assess whether there was a difference in the total 
number of laboratory measurements that changed from normal to abnormal during the two

 periods. We used McNemar’s test to assess whether the difference in number of participants 
achieving a mean CGM glucose 8·6 mmol/L or lower in the two periods was statistically 
significant. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to establish whether there was 
a correlation between the number of meal announcements and the effect on mean CGM 
glucose and time with CGM glucose concentration less than 3·3 mmol/L. p values were not 
adjusted for multiple comparisons.

Results
We randomly assigned 43 participants between May 6, 2014, and July 3, 2015 (figure 1). 
Among 21 participants randomly assigned to the bionic pancreas period first, one had an 
episode of severe hypoglycaemia during the comparator period and was removed from the 
study according to the protocol. Among 22 participants randomly assigned to the comparator 
period first, two withdrew during the comparator period before participation in the bionic 
pancreas period because of unrelated illnesses, and one withdrew during the bionic pancreas 
period because of nausea, anxiety, and inconvenience. Therefore, there were 39 assessable 
participants. The washout period between study periods was 3 days for 30 participants and 
10 days for nine participants. Table 1 lists baseline data for the 39 participants who 
completed both treatment periods and were included in the analyses. During the comparator 
period, 22 (56%) of 39 participants used their own unmasked CGM devices as a part of SAP 
treatment in addition to the masked CGM used to collect study data. Among those who used 
SAP treatment, the CGM was used on a mean of 87·2% of comparator days (SD 21·9; IQR 
81·8–100). Overall, SAP treatment was used during 211 (49%) of 429 days during the 
comparator period.
In terms of the coprimary outcomes, on days 2–11, the mean CGM glucose concentration 
was 7·8 mmol/L (SD 0·6) in the bionic pancreas period versus 9·0 mmol/L (1·6) in the 
comparator period (difference 1·1 mmol/L, 95% CI 0·7–1·6; p<0·0001), and the mean time 
with CGM glucose concentration less than 3·3 mmol/L was 0·6% (0·6) versus 1·9% (1·7; 
difference 1·3%, 95% CI 0·8–1·8; p<0·0001; figure 2; table 2). In the repeated measures 
model, we did not detect a significant period effect or carryover effect for either the mean 
CGM glucose concentration (period effect p=0·34 and carryover effect p=0·72) or the time 
with CGM glucose concentration less than 3·3 mmol/L (p=0·48 and p=0·81). In the 
multivariable analyses for both mean CGM glucose and time with CGM glucose 
concentration less than 3·3 mmol/L, we did not detect an effect of study site (data not 
shown), or of participant age or insulin total daily dose at baseline on the treatment effect 
(appendix p 5). For the mean CGM glucose concentration outcome, a higher baseline 
HbA1c concentration was associated with a larger treatment effect (p=0·0026; appendix p

 5). For time with CGM glucose concentration less than 3·3 mmol/L, a longer duration of 
diabetes was associated with a larger treatment effect (p=0·016) and a higher baseline 
HbA1c was associated with a smaller treatment effect (p=0·035; appendix p 5). Participants’ 
use of their own unmasked CGM as a component of SAP treatment, quantitated as the 
percentage of days during which CGM was used, did not affect the treatment effect either 
for mean CGM glucose (p=0·62) or for time with CGM glucose concentration less than 3·3 
mmol/L (p=0·69; appendix p 5). In a post-hoc analysis, participants were divided into 
groups according to whether they used CGM (SAP, n=22) or not (CIP, n=17) during the 
comparator period. The bionic pancreas was associated with reductions in mean CGM 
glucose in the SAP subgroup (7·9 mmol/L [SD 0·6] in the bionic pancreas period vs 9·0 
mmol/L [1·9] in the comparator period; difference 1·2 mmol/L, 95% CI 0·5–1·8; p=0·0026) 
and in the CIP subgroup (7·8 mmol/L [0·4] vs 8·9 mmol/L [1·0]; 1·1 mmol/L, 0·6–1·6; 
p=0·00057). Likewise, the bionic pancreas was associated with similar reductions in time 
with CGM glucose concentration less than 3·3 mmol/L in the SAP subgroup (0·6% [SD 0·7] 
in the bionic pancreas period vs 1·9% [2·0] in the comparator period; difference 1·3%, 95% 
CI 0·6–2·1; p=0·0028) and in the CIP subgroup (0·6% [0·4] vs 1·8% [1·4]; 1·2%, 0·6–1·8; 
p=0·00071).
The bionic pancreas was also associated with an increase in time with CGM glucose 3·9–
10·0 mmol/L of 16·5% (95% CI 12·5–20·6; 78·4% [SD 6·0] in the bionic pancreas period vs 
61·9% [14·4] in the comparator period; p<0·0001), a reduction in time with CGM glucose 
more than 10·0 mmol/L of 13·8% (9·3–18·3%, 19·8% [6·1] vs 33·6% [16·4]; p<0·0001), a 
reduction in time with CGM glucose concentration less than 3·9 mmol/L of 2·7% (1·6–3·9%, 
1·8% [1·4] vs 4·5% [3·8]; p<0·0001), and a reduction in time with CGM glucose 
concentration less than 2·8 mmol/L of 0·4% (0·3–0·6, 0·1% [0·2] vs 0·6% [0·6]; p<0·0001; 
table 2; figure 2).
During the night-time hours, the bionic pancreas was associated with a reduction in mean 
CGM glucose concentration of 1·7 mmol/L (95% CI 1·2–2·3 mmol/L; 7·4 mmol/L [SD 0·8] 
in the bionic pancreas period vs 9·2 mmol/L [2·1] in the comparator period; p<0·0001), a 
reduction in time with CGM glucose concentration less than 3·3 mmol/L of 1·6% (0·8–2·5%; 
0·3% [0·4] vs 1·9% [2·7]; p=0·0008), and an increase in the time within 3·9–10·0 mmol/L of 
24·6% (20·0–29·1%; 84·8% [8·6] vs 60·3% [16·9]; p<0·0001; table 2; figure 2). The effect of 
the bionic pancreas to decrease mean glucose concentration was greater during the night-
time than over the full 24 h day by 0·6 mmol/L (95% CI 0·3–0·9; p<0·0001); the effect of the 
bionic pancreas on reduction in time with CGM glucose concentration less than 3·3 mmol/L 
was not significantly different at night than over the full 24 h day (p=0·19). The increase in 
time with CGM glucose within 3·9–10·0 mmol/L was greater during the night-time hours 
than during the full 24 h day by 8·0% (95% CI 5·5–10·6; p<0·0001).
The aggregate mean and SD of CGM glucose concentrations, as well as the means of daily 
differences,33 showed lower glucose variability on the bionic pancreas period, both for the 
full day and at night relative to the comparator (table 2; figure 3). The bionic pancreas 
achieved a mean CGM glucose concentration less than 8·6 mmol/L during days 2–11 in 36 
(92%) of 39 participants versus 16 (41%) of 39 participants during the comparator period 
(p<0·0001; figure 2; figure 4). There was no difference in the mean CGM glucose

 concentration during days 2–11 versus during day 1 in the bionic pancreas period (p=0·91) 
or in the comparator period (p=0·98). Likewise, there was no difference in the time with 
CGM glucose concentration less than 3·3 mmol/L during days 2–11 versus during day 1 in 
the bionic pancreas period (p=0·98) or in the comparator period (p=0·92).
In response to the daily automated survey, participants reported that, over the entire study 
period, the bionic pancreas was associated with a reduction in the mean number of 
symptomatic hypoglycaemia events by 0·31 events per day (95% CI 0·07–0·56; 0·59 events 
per day [0·56] in the bionic pancreas period vs 0·90 events per day [0·64] in the comparator 
period; p=0·023), the number of times carbohydrates were taken for hypoglycaemia by 0·5 
events per day (95% CI 0·3–0·8; 0·4 events per day [0·3] vs 0·9 events per day [0·7]; 
p<0·0001; table 2; appendix p 6), and grams of carbohydrates per day consumed to treat 
hypoglycaemia by 12·8 g/day (8·4–17·2; 22 g/day [14] vs 35 g/day [16]; p=0·00033). 
Participants completed 425 (99%) of the 429 possible daily surveys in the bionic pancreas 
period and 416 (97%) in the comparator period.
The mean total daily dose of insulin delivered by the bionic pancreas varied widely between 
participants (0·26–1·07 U/kg per day), and the mean total daily insulin dose was greater 
during the bionic pancreas period than during the comparator period by 0·042 U/kg per day 
(95% CI 0·010–0·074; 0·66 U/kg per day [SD 0·15] in the bionic pancreas period vs 0·62 
U/kg per day [0·18] in the comparator period; p=0·014; figure 4). We hypothesised that 
increased insulin use in the bionic pancreas period could be related to insufficient insulin 
dosing during the comparator period for participants not meeting glycaemic goals for 
treatment. In a post-hoc analysis, we found no difference in the mean insulin total daily dose 
between the bionic pancreas and comparator periods among participants with a mean CGM 
glucose of 8·6 mmol/L or lower in the comparator period (0·61 U/kg per day [SD 0·15] in 
the bionic pancreas period vs 0·60 U/kg per day [0·18] in the comparator period; 95% CI 
−0·027 to 0·044 U/kg per day; p=0·65; appendix p 7). The mean insulin given as adaptive 
meal-priming boluses by the bionic pancreas in response to meal announcements was 23% 
(SD 8) of the total insulin delivered over days 2–11. Participants self-administered boluses 
during the comparator period a mean of 5·6 times per day (SD 2·2) for meals and 
corrections, whereas during the bionic pancreas period all corrections were automatically 
done by the bionic pancreas and participants initiated partial meal-priming boluses from the 
bionic pancreas a mean of 2·6 times per day (SD 0·8; mean range by participant 1·3–5·5) by 
providing qualitative meal announcements without carbohydrate counting (reduction of 3·0 
interactions resulting in insulin delivery per day, 95% CI 2·2–3·7; p<0·0001; appendix p 8). 
The mean number of meal announcements per day varied by participant from 1·3 per day to 
5·5 per day. In a post-hoc analysis, we found no correlation between number of meal 
announcements during the bionic pancreas period and the treatment effect for either of the 
coprimary outcomes (p=1·0, R2=0·00028 for mean CGM and p=0·96, R2=0·00778 for time 
with CGM glucose concentration <3·3 mmol/L). The mean total daily dose of glucagon over 
days 2–5 was 0·51 mg/day (SD 0·19, range 0·23–0·90), or 6·8 µg/kg per day (2·4; appendix p 
17). Participants were asked to take at least four capillary plasma glucose measurements 
during the bionic pancreas period, but took fewer plasma glucose measurements in the 
bionic pancreas period than in the comparator period by 1·2 measurements per day (95% CI 
0·6–1·7; 4·1 measurements per day [SD 1·7] vs 5·3 measurements per day [1·8]; p=0·0001).

 Plasma glucose values were entered into the bionic pancreas on 14 occasions (mean 0·4 
occasions per participant) when the CGM signal was unavailable; the bionic pancreas 
responded with bolus insulin on three of those occasions and bolus glucagon on no 
occasions.
No episodes of severe hypoglycaemia occurred in the bionic pancreas period. One 
participant had an episode of severe hypoglycaemia in the comparator period and was 
removed from the study according to the protocol (appendix p 57).
We found no difference in the self-reported mean minutes per day engaged in exercise in the 
bionic pancreas and comparator periods (39 min/day [SD 28] in the bionic pancreas period 
vs 39 min/day [32] in the comparator period; 95% CI −8·9 to 8·0; p=0·99), or in alcohol 
consumption between the two periods (0·5 drinks per day [0·5] vs 0·5 drinks per day [0·5]; –
0·1 to 0·2; p=0·35).
There was no difference in the change in body mass from day 1 to day 11 between the bionic 
pancreas and comparator periods (0·4 kg [SD 1·0] in the bionic pancreas period vs 0·1 kg 
[1·1] in the comparator period; 95% CI −0·1 to 0·8; p=0·17). Likewise, from day 1 to day 11, 
there was no difference between the bionic pancreas and comparator periods in the mean 
change in systolic (−2·2 mm Hg [12] vs −1·9 mm Hg [16]; 95% CI −6·3 to 4·0; p=0·93) or 
diastolic blood pressure (−1·1 mm Hg [8·0] vs −1·9 mm Hg [10·0]; −12·3 to 5·9; p=0·70). 
When participants were asked to report nausea on a Visual Analogue Scale, the number 
reporting a score greater than 0 on at least one day was 21 in the bionic pancreas period and 
five in the comparator period.
The mean nausea score on the Visual Analogue Scale was greater during the bionic pancreas 
period (0·52 [SD 0·83]) than in the comparator period (0·05 [0·17]; difference 0·47, 95% CI 
0·21–0·73; p=0·0024; appendix p 9). Two participants reported vomiting in the bionic 
pancreas period and one in the comparator period. There was no difference in the mean 
change in any haematology parameter or in 22 of the 25 chemistry tests from day 1 to day 
11 between the bionic pancreas and comparator periods. The mean change differed 
significantly between periods in three of the tests, but these were not safety concerns 
because the values remained within the normal range (appendix p 10). Of 1443 possible 
instances (ie, pairs of before and after values for the same test), laboratory test results 
changed from normal to abnormal between days 1 and 11 in 48 instances during the bionic 
pancreas period and in 44 instances during the comparator period (p=0·98).
The mean absolute relative difference between plasma glucose concentrations and the 
closest CGM glucose value within 2·5 min of a plasma glucose measurement was 18·5% 
(mean of 91·1 plasma glucose–CGM measurement pairs per participant; n=3554), with a 
mean negative bias (CGM glucose concentration below the plasma glucose concentration) of 
1·1%. The mean absolute relative difference did not differ between the bionic pancreas and 
comparator periods (19·2% vs 18·0%; 95% CI −0·7 to 3·2; p=0·22).
The insulin pumps lost wireless connectivity to the bionic pancreas a mean of 3·9% (SD 2·5) 
of the time and the glucagon pumps 4·1% (2·5%) of the time. The CGM signal was 
unavailable 3·4% of the time during the bionic pancreas period and 3·7% of the time during

 the comparator period (95% CI −0·78 to 0·30; p=0·39). 11 (6%) of 200 insulin infusion site 
changes in the bionic pancreas period and 15 (9%) of 175 in the comparator period were 
unscheduled (appendix p 11). 14 (3%) of 422 glucagon infusion site changes were 
unscheduled (appendix p 11). During the bionic pancreas period, the device was being worn 
and working properly for at least 23 h a day on 393 (95·2%) of 413 days for which surveys 
were returned. During the comparator period, the bionic pancreas monitoring configuration 
(with only the masked CGM active) was being worn and working properly for at least 23 h a 
day on 396 (96·8%) of 409 days for which surveys were returned (appendix pp 12–14).
Discussion
In this study, the bionic pancreas reduced mean CGM glucose concentrations, 
hypoglycaemia, symptomatic hypoglycaemia, and carbohydrates given to treat 
hypoglycaemia relative to the comparator period. This finding occurred despite participants 
taking fewer capillary plasma glucose measurements and triggering fewer insulin boluses 
during the bionic pancreas period. When participants did interact with the bionic pancreas to 
announce a meal, the interaction required no carbohydrate counting.
By contrast with other automated insulin delivery systems,20–25 the bionic pancreas tested in 
this study automated delivery of both insulin and glucagon and required no information for 
initialisation other than the participant’s body mass.20–27 In this study, the participants’ 
insulin requirements varied by more than four times during the bionic pancreas period, yet 
the bionic pancreas adapted automatically to each participant’s insulin needs and was able to 
manage glycaemia with no information about the participants’ past insulin-pump regimens. 
Whether artificial pancreas systems can be used as the initial treatment, without a 
preliminary period of CIP or SAP treatment, in patients newly diagnosed with type 1 
diabetes remains to be established.
Debate is ongoing regarding what is the best control group for studies of artificial pancreas 
systems: usual care or the most sophisticated treatment available (ie, SAP treatment).34 In 
this study, more than half of participants used SAP treatment, and the effect of the bionic 
pancreas was similar in participants who used SAP and CIP treatments. Future studies 
should include participants who are naive to advanced diabetes technology,34 since many 
patients with type 1 diabetes do not use pumps (30–60% are pump users)35, 36 and an even 
smaller proportion use CGM (∼11% used CGM according to a 2015 survey).35, 36 The small 
amount of input required from the user by the bionic pancreas is likely to make it 
particularly useful in patients who have no previous experience with advanced diabetes 
technology.
This study had several limitations. The number of participants was small and their glycaemic 
control was better than usually found in patients with type 1 diabetes at baseline.4–6 The 
study duration was short and a longer trial is needed to establish whether patients will 
consistently use the bionic pancreas for longer periods. This was a crossover trial, so there 
was the possibility of both period and carryover effects; although no such effects were 
detected, the trial was not powered to detect them. At the request of the US Food and Drug 
Administration, we monitored participants remotely in both periods of the study for severe

 biochemical hypoglycaemia (CGM glucose <2·8 mmol/L) and alerted participants who had 
episodes below this threshold lasting more than 15 min. The percentage of time with CGM 
glucose concentration less than 3·3 mmol/L and less than 2·8 mmol/L were both reduced in 
the bionic pancreas period compared with the comparator period, but these differences might 
have been larger if no remote monitoring had been done. We also monitored remotely for 
loss of wireless communication between the iPhone and the pump that lasted for more than 
15 min. Results with this version of the bionic pancreas would probably have been worse 
without monitoring for connectivity. Longer duration day-and-night home-use studies of an 
insulin-only artificial pancreas system have been done successfully without remote 
monitoring.23–25 The next generation of our bionic pancreas integrates both of the pumps, 
the CGM receiver, and the algorithms into a single unit, thereby eliminating the need for 
wireless communication with the pumps, and this device will need to be tested in studies 
without remote monitoring. Our study did not compare the bihormonal bionic pancreas with 
an insulin-only configuration. Other investigators have directly compared insulin-only and 
bihormonal artificial pancreas systems in night-time-only studies.37, 38
The version of the bionic pancreas device used in this study has several limitations. 
Acetaminophen can lead to overestimation of blood glucose by the current generation 
Dexcom CGM, so we requested that participants refrain from using acetaminophen.39, 40 
The next generation of the Dexcom CGM sensors will be resistant to interference by 
acetaminophen. Other CGM sensor technologies available in Europe but not the USA 
(Abbott FreeStyle Flash, Abbott Diabetes Care, Abbot Park, IL, USA; and Senseonics 
Eversense, Senseonics, Germantown, MD, USA) are resistant to such interference.40, 41 The 
glucagon reservoir had to be filled daily because of the unstable nature of glucagon 
formulations. Stable formulations and analogues of glucagon have been developed42–46 that 
should obviate the need for daily glucagon reservoir changes; however, the extent to which 
the use of glucagon will increase the cost of treatment is unknown.
Several findings from this trial warrant further investigation. More participants experienced 
nausea in the bionic pancreas period than in the comparator period, although the absolute 
amount was low. In this study, but not in our two previous studies in adolescents and 
preadolescents,17, 18 more insulin was used in the bionic pancreas period than in the 
comparator period. The increment was small and there was no difference in insulin total 
daily dose among participants who achieved a mean glucose concentration in the comparator 
period (8·6 mmol/L) predicted to give an HbA1c of 7% or lower.30, 31 This result is 
consistent with the bionic pancreas delivering additional insulin to participants who were not 
taking enough insulin during the comparator period. Likewise, small changes in several 
laboratory values were associated with the use of the bionic pancreas, but none seemed to 
raise safety concerns. Whether these findings are of clinical significance, and whether the 
balance of benefits, risks, and costs associated with the use of glucagon will be favourable 
overall, requires further study.47
Relative to CIP treatment and SAP treatments, the bihormonal bionic pancreas, initialised 
only with participant body mass, was able to achieve superior glycaemic regulation in this 
free-living home-use trial, without the need for carbohydrate counting. A fully integrated

 device should be tested in much larger studies of longer duration to establish the long-term 
benefits and risks of automated glycaemic management with a bihormonal bionic pancreas.

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE for articles published up to Oct 31, 2016, using the search terms 
(“artificial pancreas” OR “bionic pancreas” OR “closed-loop”) AND (“diabetes mellitus” 
OR “diabetes”) AND (“randomised” OR “randomised controlled trial”). We identified 11 
randomised trials that tested automated or semi-automated glucose control during the day 
and night in the outpatient setting. Six of these studies tested insulin-only systems and 
three were done in the home setting. These studies were done in a supervised hotel-based 
setting, diabetes camps, or in a unsupervised free-living home setting. All initialised the 
artificial pancreas with information from the participant’s insulin regimen and required 
carbohydrate counting. In two of the home studies, participants were restricted in their 
use of the artificial pancreas during vigorous exercise, but in one study lasting 12 weeks 
participants had no restrictions on exercise afterthefirst2 weeks. This study showed 
increased time in range, decreased mean glucose concentration, and reduced 
hypoglycaemia exposure compared with sensor-augmented pump treatment. Five of the 
outpatient studies tested a system using both insulin and glucagon. Three of these were 
our own previous studies: one a hotel-based study of adults who stayed in a hotel at night 
and were free to move around a city centre with an escort, and two in adolescents or 
preadolescents, respectively, in a diabetes camp environment. In our previous studies, we 
found decreased mean glucose and hypoglycaemia or need for treatment of 
hypoglycaemia with a bionic pancreas compared with usual care. In the other two 
outpatient studies, participants were required to stay in a clinical research centre at the 
beginning of the study and the settings were adjusted before participants went home for 2 
or 3 days. The parameters of the artificial pancreas algorithm were further adjusted by the 
research team during the home-use period. Use of the artificial pancreas in these studies 
was not associated with a reduction in median glucose concentration or hypoglycaemia.
Added value of this study
We did a multicentre study of automated glycaemic control using both insulin and 
glucagon in an unrestricted home-use setting, with each participant using the bihormonal 
bionic pancreas and their usual treatment for 11 days each in random order, during which 
time they participated in their usual activities and had no restrictions on diet or exercise. 
The bionic pancreas was initialised only with the body mass of the participants and was 
adapted autonomously to the participants’ insulin needs. Meal announcements were not 
required, and, when given, did not require carbohydrate counting. We found that the 
bihormonal bionic pancreas reduced the mean glucose concentration, reduced 
hypoglycaemia, increased the time in range (3·9–10·0 mmol/L), and reduced the need for 
carbohydrate interventions for hypoglycaemia versus conventional insulin pump 
treatment and sensor-augmented pump treatment. Use of the bihormonal bionic pancreas 
was associated with a mean glucose concentration predicted to correspond to a glycated 
haemoglobin of 7% or lower in 92% of participants versus 41% in those in the usual care 
comparator period, while simultaneously reducing hypoglycaemia to 0·6% of the time 
versus 1·9% of the time in the comparator period.

 Implications of all the available evidence
A bihormonal bionic pancreas has the potential to deliver substantially improved 
glycaemic management in patients with type 1 diabetes. Since only the body mass is 
required for initialisation of the system, less time and effort will be needed of health-care 
providers to start treatment. Since meal announcements are optional and no carbohydrate 
counting is required, use of the bionic pancreas reduces the patient burden associated 
with management of diabetes. Longer trials will be needed to assess the long-term 
benefits and risks of automated glycaemic management using insulin and glucagon.

(A) Mean CGM glucose concentration in each participant on days 2–11 of the comparator 
period (centre of red circles), connected by a line to the corresponding mean CGM glucose 
concentration during the bionic pancreas period (centre of black circles). The diameter of 
each circle is proportional to the percentage of time that the patient spent with a CGM 
glucose concentration less than 3·3 mmol/L. The solid red line represents the aggregate 
mean for all study participants. The dashed horizontal red line shows a mean CGM glucose 
concentration of 8·6 mmol/L. (B) Cumulative CGM glucose concentrations during the
