Advanced age is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, which is usually 
referred to as inflammaging. Elderly are also known to have an altered gut microbiota 
composition. However, whether inflammaging is a cause or consequence of an altered 
gut microbiota composition is not clear. In this study, gut microbiota from young or old 
conventional mice was transferred to young germ-free (GF) mice. Four weeks after gut 
microbiota transfer immune cell populations in spleen, Peyer’s patches, and mesen-
teric lymph nodes from conventionalized GF mice were analyzed by flow cytometry. 
In addition, whole-genome gene expression in the ileum was analyzed by microarray. 
Gut microbiota composition of donor and recipient mice was analyzed with 16S rDNA 
sequencing. Here, we show by transferring aged microbiota to young GF mice that 
certain bacterial species within the aged microbiota promote inflammaging. This effect 
was associated with lower levels of Akkermansia and higher levels of TM7 bacteria and 
Proteobacteria in the aged microbiota after transfer. The aged microbiota promoted 
inflammation in the small intestine in the GF mice and enhanced leakage of inflammatory 
bacterial components into the circulation was observed. Moreover, the aged microbiota 
promoted increased T cell activation in the systemic compartment. In conclusion, these 
data indicate that the gut microbiota from old mice contributes to inflammaging after 
transfer to young GF mice.

The gut microbiota is a highly complex and diverse community of bacteria that closely interacts 
with the epithelium and underlying immune cells in the gut (1). The bacterial divisions that domi-
nate the human gut microbiota are Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria  
(2). The dominance of these bacterial divisions is evolutionary conserved and has been confirmed

in different mammalian species (3, 4). In recent years, it has 
become clear that the gut microbiota has a major impact on 
the immune system, metabolism, and even behavior of the host 
(5). Moreover, an imbalance in gut microbiota composition 
(dysbiosis) has been associated with several immunological, 
metabolic, and mental disorders (6). However, for the majority 
of these diseases it remains unclear whether dysbiosis is a cause 
or consequence of the disease.
In adults, the gut microbial community remains relatively 
stable (7). However, a number of studies have shown that gut 
microbiota composition is different in the elderly. For example, 
it has been demonstrated that Firmicutes was dominant in the 
gut microbiota of young individuals, whereas Bacteroidetes was 
more prevalent in the gut microbiota in the elderly (8, 9). Others 
found a decrease in anaerobes such as Bifidobacteria, but an 
increase in Enterobacteria, such as Escherichia coli in the elderly 
(10, 11). In people above 100 years old, an increase in pathobi-
onts was observed (12). Also bacteria with anti-inflammatory 
properties such as Faecalibacterium prauznitzii were decreased 
in older individuals (13).
Concomitantly with microbiota changes, immunity becomes 
impaired in elderly (14). Elderly are known to be more suscep-
tible to infections and mount less effective immune responses after 
vaccination. Moreover, homeostasis between pro-inflammatory 
and regulatory responses is lost, which results in a state of 
low-grade chronic systemic inflammation (14). The age-related 
chronic inflammation, which is called inflammaging, likely 
contributes to the pathology of several diseases typically associ-
ated with aging such as dementia, stroke, and cardiovascular 
diseases. In addition, advanced age has been reported to increase 
intestinal permeability in rodents and non-human primates and 
may subsequently enhance translocation of luminal bacterial 
products and induce inflammation (15, 16).
Whether age-induced microbiota changes are associated with 
inflammaging is not entirely clear, but there are some indica-
tions that intestinal microbes are involved in this process (17). 
 
To address the influence of the aged gut microbiota on the 
immune system, we transferred the gut microbiota from young or 
old conventional mice to germ-free (GF) mice. We demonstrate 
that the aged microbiota induced higher frequencies of several 
T helper (Th) cell subsets, in particular in the spleen. Moreover, 
expression of several inflammatory markers was elevated in 
 
the ileum after transferring microbiota of aged mice. Presumably 
translocation of bacterial components occurred, since the serum 
after transfer of aged microbiota contained higher levels of 
immunostimulatory bacterial components. Finally, gut micro-
biota composition analysis revealed differences in abundance of 
bacterial species such as Akkermansia, TM7, and Proteobacteria, 
which are potentially involved in the increased inflammatory 
potential of the microbiota of aged mice.
MaTerials anD MeThODs
study Design
All animal experiments were approved by the local ethical com-
mittee of the University of Groningen (project number 6543) 
and adhered to FELASA guidelines. The objective of this study 
was to determine whether the gut microbiota from aged mice 
contributes to the aging of the immune system. To this end, 
gut microbiota from young or old conventional mice was trans-
ferred to young GF mice. Effects on the immune system were 
compared between young or old conventional mice, GF recipi-
ents of young or old microbiota, and GF mice that remained GF 
throughout the experiment. Each experimental group consisted 
of 10 mice per group, except the control group of GF mice, 
which consisted of 5 mice per group. After an acclimatization 
period of at least 4 weeks, feces were freshly collected from 
the conventional mice. Feces from the same group was pooled 
and mixed in PBS. Next, 200 µl of 100 mg/ml of this mixture 
were given by oral gavage to GF mice of 12–14 weeks old. After 
transfer, recipient mice were individually housed in IVC cages 
for another 4 weeks. Mice were sacrificed on 10 different days, 
each day one mouse per group.
Mice
Young (7–10 weeks) or old (17 months) C57BL/6JRccHsd 
con 
ventional female mice were purchased from a commercial 
supplier (Envigo, Horst, the Netherlands). Female GF mice 
of 12–14 weeks were obtained from a breeding colony at the 
animal facility of Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre 
(Nijmegen, the Netherlands). All animals were put on an 
autoclaved Rat/mouse maintenance V153X R/M-H diet (Ssniff, 
Soest, Germany) directly after weaning in the case of GF mice, or 
directly after arrival in the case of conventional mice. The mice 
were kept on this diet throughout the experiment. Conventional 
mice were housed in IVC cages and GF mice were housed in 
 
GF isolators.
Organ and Tissue collection
Mice were sacrificed at the following ages: young conventional 
mice 16–19 weeks, old conventional mice 19–20 months, GF 
recipient mice 16–18 weeks, GF mice 13–15 weeks. Mice were 
anesthetized with isoflurane, bled, and sacrificed by cervical 
dislocation. Serum was collected and stored at −80°C. Colon 
content and a piece of terminal ileum were snap frozen in liquid 
nitrogen and stored at −80°C. In addition, spleen, Peyer’s patches 
(PPs), and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were collected for 
FACS analysis.
Flow cytometry
Single cell suspensions were obtained from spleen, PPs, and 
MLNs. Cells were stained with Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 
506 (eBioscience, Vienna, Austria) for exclusion of dead cells. 
A-specific binding to Fc receptors was blocked by incubating 
the cells with anti-CD16/32 (clone 93, Biolegend, Uithoorn, the 
Netherlands) for 15 min on ice. For extracellular staining, cells 
were incubated with the desired mixture of antibodies for 30 min 
on ice. After washing, cells were fixed with FACS lysing solution 
(BD Biosciences, Breda, the Netherlands). For intracellular stain-
ing, fixed cells were permeabilized with PERM (eBioscience, 
Vienna, Austria) and subsequently stained with the desired 
antibodies for 30 min on ice. For identification of the different 
Th cell subsets, cells were stained with antibodies against: CD3e

(clone 17A2), CD4 (clone GK1.5), T-bet (clone 4B10), RORγt 
(clone B2D), Gata-3 (clone TWAJ), CD25 (clone PC61), and 
Foxp3 (clone FJK-16S). Appropriate isotype controls were used 
to determine specificity of the staining. Samples were acquired 
with the FACSVerse (BD Biosciences, Breda) and analyzed with 
FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC, Oregon, USA).
Transcriptome Microarray
A piece of terminal ileum from each mouse was snap frozen 
in liquid nitrogen and stored afterward at −80°C. From these 
samples, RNA was isolated with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, 
Valencia, CA, USA) and whole-genome gene expression was 
analyzed with Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.1 ST arrays 
as described previously (18). The gene expression datasets 
were deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
and are accessible through GEO Series accession number: 
GSE104063.
heK293 toll-like receptor (Tlr)2/Tlr4 
assay
Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells stably transfected with 
mouse TLR2/CD14 or TLR4/MD-2/CD14 and the secreted 
embryonic alkaline phosphatase reporter coupled to the NF-kB/
AP-1 promoter were purchased from Invivogen (San Diego, 
CA, USA). Every cell line was grown at 37°C, 5% CO2 in DMEM 
medium (Lonza B.V., Basel, Switzerland), supplemented with 
4.5 g/l glucose, 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 
50 U/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 mg/ml 
Normocin. After two passages, the cells were cultured in the 
presence of HEK-Blue selection medium (Invi 
vogen, San Diego, 
CA, USA) in order to maintain the transfected constructs. 
Cells were stimulated with 2.5% mouse serum for 20 h at 37°C, 
5% CO2. As a control, cells were stimulated in triplo with 
medium only (negative control), 100 ng/ml lipopolysaccha-
ride (LPS)-EK (InvivoGen; positive control for TLR4), or 107  
bacteria/well of heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes (InvivoGen; 
positive control for TLR2). Next, 20 µl medium from each well 
was aliquoted and mixed with 180 µl QUANTI-Blue reagent 
(Invivogen, San Diego, CA, USA). After incubation at 37°C for 
2 h, OD at 650 nm was measured with a microplate absorbance 
spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Veenendaal, the 
Netherlands).
Microbiota analysis
Fresh feces samples obtained just after defecation were collected 
from all mice at different time points during the experiment. 
In addition, colonic content samples from these mice were col-
lected at the end of the experiment. All samples were snap frozen 
in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. These samples were 
used for 16S rRNA gene analysis for microbiota profiling with 
barcoded amplicons from the V1–V2 region of 16S rRNA genes 
as described previously (18). Briefly, amplicon pools were 250 bp 
paired-end sequenced using Illumina Miseq (GATC-Biotech, 
Konstanz, Germany). The Illumina Miseq data analysis was car-
ried out with a workflow employing the Quantitative Insights 
Into Microbial Ecology pipeline (19) and a set of in-house scripts 
as described before for Illumina Hiseq 16S rRNA gene sequences 
(Hermes et al., manuscript in preparation).
statistics
Flow cytometry data and HEK293 TLR assay data are expressed 
as means, error bars represent SEM. To verify whether data 
were normally distributed, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was 
performed. In cases where data were not normally distributed, 
data were log transformed before analysis. For comparing 
two groups, the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test was used. 
 
For comparing more than two groups with each other, one 
way ANOVA was performed followed by the Bonferroni test to 
compare specific groups. P-values below 0.05 were considered 
significant. All tests were performed with Graphpad software 
(Prism, La Jolla, CA, USA).

Microbiota of Old Mice enhances cD4+  
T cell Differentiation in the spleen
In order to investigate how aging influences the interplay 
between the gut microbiota and the immune system of the host, 
we transferred gut microbiota from young (11–14 weeks) or old 
(18 months) conventional mice to young GF mice (12–14 weeks). 
Four weeks later, the mice were sacrificed and the frequency of 
 
the different CD4+ Th subsets were identified in the PPs, MLNs, 
and the spleen by flow cytometry (see Figure S1 in Supplementary 
Material for gating strategy). Conventional mice, aged 11–14 weeks, 
or 18 months served as control.
In conventional mice, a higher frequency of Th2 cells was 
found in the spleen of old mice compared with young mice 
(Figure 1A). This enhanced Th2 frequency could be induced 
by transfer of the old microbiota to young GF mice and was 
not observed when young microbiota was transferred. Also the 
high Treg (Figure 1B) and Th1 (Figure 1C) numbers in spleens 
of old conventional mice could be induced by transfer of old 
microbiota. GF mice, which received the old microbiota had 
a higher frequency of splenic Tregs (Figure 1B) and Th1 cells 
(Figure 1C) than GF mice which received the young micro-
biota. No differences were observed in Th17 cells (data not 
shown). Furthermore, in the PPs and MLNs no differences 
were observed in Th frequencies (data not shown), except for 
Th1 cells in PPs, which were significantly higher in GF mice 
after transfer of the old microbiota (Figure 1D) when com-
pared with GF mice after transfer of microbiota of young mice. 
 
In conclusion, the old microbiota enhanced CD4+ T cell dif-
ferentiation or distribution of several Th subsets, in particular 
in the systemic compartment.

the ileum with microarray. Genes that were significantly higher 
expressed in the ileum of old conventional mice compared 
with young conventional mice were analyzed with the STRING 
database (20). We identified a large cluster of genes involved 
in the immune response that were upregulated in the ileum 
of old conventional mice (Figure 2A). The function of these 
genes included antigen processing and presentation, activation 
of the complement pathway, recognition of microbe-associated 
molecular patterns, and migration of B cells. TNF-α was in the 
center of this network, which might suggest that TNF-α plays an 
important role in these processes.
Also genes that were significantly higher expressed in GF 
mice that received the old microbiota compared with recipients 
of young microbiota were analyzed with the STRING database. 
Also here we identified a cluster of genes with TNF-α in the 
center of the network (Figure 2B). These results might sug-
gest that TNF-α production is specifically enhanced by the old 
microbiota.

Microbiota
Microarray data were further analyzed with Ingenuity Pathway 
Analysis (IPA), only focusing on genes that were significantly dif-
ferentially expressed (P < 0.05, fold-change >1.2 or <−1.2) when 
comparing old versus young conventional mice, or GF recipient 
mice that received young versus old microbiota. Interestingly, 
we observed three canonical pathways that were significantly 
affected both in the conventional mice and in the GF recipient 
mice (Figure 3A). The canonical pathways “role of PRRs in 
recognition of bacteria and viruses,” “Th cell differentiation,” 
and “B-cell development” were upregulated in old conventional 
mice compared with young conventional mice and also in GF 
recipients of old microbiota compared with recipients of young 
microbiota. Therefore, these pathways might be in particular 
influenced by the microbiota during aging.

Also predicted upstream regulators were identified with 
IPA. Upstream regulators are the upstream transcriptional 
regulators that potentially explain the observed gene expres-
sion differences in the dataset. The most significantly predicted 
upstream regulator that could cause the gene expression 
profile in old conventional mice in comparison with young 
conventional mice was LPS (Figure 3B). Importantly, LPS from 
Salmonella enterica was among the most significantly predicted 
upstream regulators of old microbiota after transfer to GF mice 
(Figure 3B). Thus, LPS is a component of the old microbiota 
that is possibly involved in mediating its effects on the immune 
system of the host.
To further identify the genes that were specifically influenced 
by the old microbiota, we compared the genes that were differ-
entially expressed between young versus old conventional mice 
and GF recipients of young versus old microbiota (Figure 3C). 
We identified 27 genes that were differentially expressed in both 
datasets. This list of genes was further narrowed down to genes 
that were up- or down-regulated in both datasets and are known 
to play a role in the immune response. As mentioned above, 
TNF-α was upregulated both in old conventional mice and in 
GF recipients of old microbiota. Also, TNFSF8, which is the 
ligand for CD30, was more highly expressed in these groups of 
mice. On the other hand, several genes encoding for the lambda 
immunoglobulin light chain were more highly expressed both 
in young conventional mice and in GF recipients of young 
microbiota.
higher amounts of Bacterial components 
in systemic circulation after Old 
Microbiota Transfer
As LPS was a prominent predicted upstream regulator in the 
ileal IPA analysis, we investigated whether there were innate 
immune activating components in sera of animals receiving old 
microbiota. These components can possibly be transferred from 
the intestine by translocation of bacterial components due to a 
compromised intestinal barrier (21, 22). To this end, we incubated 
the sera of these mice with HEK293 cells transfected with TLR 
2 or TLR4. Activation of NFκB was measured with a reporter 
gene. No differences were observed between old conventional 
mice and young conventional mice. However, the sera from GF 
mice, which had received old microbiota showed significantly 
higher activation of TLR2 compared with sera from recipients 
 FigUre 2 | Old microbiota upregulates several immune pathways in the ileum. Whole-genome gene expression in the ileum of mice (n = 5 per group) was assessed 
with Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.1 ST arrays. The most highly upregulated genes were analyzed with the STRING database. Only genes with  
at least one interaction are shown. The following interactions are indicated: from curated databases (blue), experimentally determined (pink), textmining (yellow),

of young microbiota (Figure 4A). A similar trend was observed 
for TLR4 activation, although this difference did not reach 
 
statistical significance (Figure 4B). In summary, these data indi-
cate that old microbiota transfer leads to increased translocation 
of inflammatory bacterial products into the circulation.
Bacterial groups associated with 
increased inflammatory Potential  
of Old Microbiota
Next, we investigated how the gut microbiota composition changes 
over time in the recipient mice. To this end, the composition 
of the gut microbiota of the different experimental groups was 
analyzed with 16S rDNA sequencing. From the GF recipient 
mice that received old or young microbiota, we analyzed feces 
1 week after transfer or 4 weeks after transfer (Figure 5). We were 
particularly interested to see whether the gut microbiota evolves 
into a community similar to the donor, or whether it adapts to 
its host. Redundancy analysis at the genus level confirmed that 
gut microbiota composition was different between old conven-
tional mice and young conventional mice, since the samples 
separated into two distinct clusters (Figure 6A). The samples 
collected 1 week after transfer also separated into two different 
clusters, suggesting that the transfer of different gut microbiota 
communities also led to the establishment of different micro-
biota communities in the recipients. However, after 4 weeks gut

recipient mice of young or old microbiota (n = 10), and GF control mice (n = 5). Activation of these receptors was measured with a secreted embryonic alkaline 
phosphatase reporter coupled to the NF-kB/AP-1 promoter. All data are expressed as means. **P < 0.01.

microbiota composition in the recipient mice was most similar 
to the gut microbiota composition in young conventional mice. 
Moreover, at this time point the clusters of samples derived from 
the recipient mice were showing more overlap, which suggests 
 
gut microbiota composition of the two groups became more 
similar to each other compared with the first week time point. 
Together these results indicate that at 1 week the gut microbiota 
composition of the donor dictates the gut microbiota composi-
tion in the recipient, but at later time points the gut microbiota 
composition adapts to the host.
To look more specifically at the bacterial groups that were 
responsible for the observed differences in immune responses, 
we investigated which bacterial phyla had a significant difference 
in abundance (Figure 6B). Compared with young conventional 
mice, old conventional mice had higher abundance of Tenericutes, 
but lower abundance of Verrucomicrobia. Akkermansia is the only 
genus known to belong to the Verrocumicrobia phylum. Indeed 
we observed a similar difference in abundance for Akkermansia 
(data not shown). In addition, age influenced the Firmicutes/ 
Bacteroidetes ratio. Old conventional mice had more Bacteroidetes, 
but less Firmicutes compared with young conventional mice. 
Interestingly, 1 week after transfer of old microbiota, recipient 
mice had significant less Verrucomicrobia than GF mice that 
received young microbiota (Figure 6B). There was also a dif-
ference in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, but surprisingly 
recipients of old microbiota had significantly less Bacteroidetes 
and more Firmicutes compared with recipients of young micro-
biota. Four weeks after transfer, the differences at 1 week were 
no longer present. However, at this time point recipients of old 
microbiota had a higher abundance of TM7 and Proteobacteria 
(Figure 6B). The difference in Proteobacteria was likely due to 
a difference in abundance of Desulfovibrio, since this was the 
only Proteobacterium that was significantly more abundant at 
the genus level after transfer of old microbiota. In summary, 
 
a number of bacterial groups were identified that were affected 
by age, which included Akkermansia, TM7, and Proteobacteria. 
These bacterial groups are possibly involved in the increased 
inflammatory potential of the old microbiota.
DiscUssiOn
Several studies have demonstrated that aging is associated with an 
altered gut microbiota composition, inflammaging, and increased 
 
gut permeability (17). However, whether the aged microbiota is 
a cause or consequence of inflammaging is not known. To the 
 
best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that some char-
acteristics of this typical immunosenescence can be induced 
by microbiota of aged mice after transfer into young GF mice. 
Microorganisms associated with this effect were found to be 
Akkermansia, TM7 bacteria, and Proteobacteria. Our results indi-
cate that increased amounts of TLR2-stimulating components 
were found in the circulation of recipients of old microbiota, 
which may have promoted increased inflammation and enhanced 
T cell differentiation. Interestingly, dysbiosis and a comprised 
intestinal barrier are also observed in several other disorders 
 
such as IBD and metabolic syndrome (23, 24).
Certain bacterial species colonizing the gut have been shown 
to induce a specific subset of Th cell. For example, segmented 
filamentous bacterium was found to specifically induce

Aged Gut Microbiota Induces Inflammaging

A produced by the human symbiont Bacteroides fragilis was 
shown to promote expansion of IL-10-producing Treg cells in 
a TLR2-dependent manner (26–28). It has also been demon-
strated that certain Clostridium species induce Treg cells in the 
colon (29, 30). In our study, the aged microbiota did not promote 
differentiation of a specific Th cell subset. However, after transfer 
of aged microbiota to GF mice, we rather observed increased 
levels of several Th cell subsets. This effect was almost exclusively 
observed in the spleen, but not in the PPs or MLNs. These results 
do not suggest an association with any of the bacterial species 
mentioned above. An increased exposure of naïve T cells in 
the systemic compartment to bacterial compounds in general 
as a result of a reduced intestinal barrier seems a more likely 
explanation.
The transfer of old microbiota into young GF mice induced 
differential regulation of pathways including T cell differentia-
tion, B-cell development, and recognition of microbes by pattern 
recognition receptors. A central regulatory cytokine was TNF-α, 
which was consistently upregulated by the old microbiota both 
in the conventional mice and GF recipient mice. TNF-α is well 
known for its role in the pro-inflammatory response (31). TNF-α 
also plays a central role in the pathogenesis of IBD and anti-
TNF-α agents are used in the clinic to treat the disease (32). TNF-
α was also shown to increase intestinal epithelial permeability 
(33). Interestingly, in agreement with our data it was recently 
demonstrated that age-associated inflammation depends on the 
microbiota and TNF- α (34).
Young microbiota had a different effect and increased 
expres 
sion of lambda immunoglobulin light chain genes both 
in conventional and GF recipient mice. B cells express only 
one class of light chain, lambda (λ), or kappa (κ). It has been 
observed previously that the gut microbiota can influence the 
ratio of these two light chains. Microbial colonization of GF 
mice was shown to increase the ratio of Igλ+ to Igκ+ B cells in 
the lamina propria (35). Since increased Igλ usage by B cells is 
considered a marker for B-cell receptor editing (36–38), these 
results might suggest that the young microbiota promote a more 
diverse B-cell repertoire. Another possibility is that the young 
microbiota contains more antigens that are recognized by B-cell 
clones that express Igλ.

The increased level of differentiated CD4+ T cells in the 
spleen, the elevated inflammation in the ileum, and the predic-
tion of LPS as an upstream regulator in the presence of aged 
microbiota led us to hypothesize that more bacterial components 
had translocated into the circulation in animals containing old 
microbiota. Indeed we observed that serum of GF recipients of 
old microbiota had an increased ability to activate TLR2 and 
trend toward increased TLR4 stimulation. Similar mechanisms 
seem to contribute to other disorders such as type 2 diabetes 
and metabolic syndrome. High-fat diet was shown to alter gut 
microbiota composition, which increased the permeability of 
the small intestine (22). The increased permeability allowed 
bacterial components to reach distal sites, which induced low-
grade inflammation and subsequent insulin resistance (21). 
Importantly, the mucin-degrading bacterium A. muciniphila was 
shown to reverse these metabolic disorders by strengthening the 
intestinal barrier (39). In our study, old conventional mice had 
lower abundance of Akkermansia, which has also been reported 
previously both in humans and mice (40, 41). Akkermansia was 
also less abundant after transfer of old microbiota to GF mice at 
early time points. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the 
absence of Akkermansia in recipients of old microbiota might 
 
be associated with translocation of inflammatory bacterial com-
ponents into the circulation.
As mentioned previously, certain members of the gut micro-
biota modulate the immune system (42). However, components 
of the immune system such as IgA antibodies also shape gut 
microbiota composition (43–45). Therefore, we investigated 
whether after transfer to GF mice the aged microbiota remained 
similar in composition to the donor or would quickly adapt to 
the young host. One week after transfer, the composition of old 
and young microbiota was clearly different, but after 4 weeks 
the difference was less pronounced, and both the microbiota 
from the old and young mice were more similar to the micro-
biota of the young mice. This suggests that the aged microbiota 
had partially adapted to the young host. As described for aged 
humans (8, 9), old conventional mice had a lower Firmicutes/
Bacteroidetes ratio. However, this trait was not transferable to GF 
mice. Four weeks after transfer, GF recipients of old microbiota 
had more TM7 bacteria and Proteobacteria. The difference in 
Proteobacteria was at least partially due to a significant lower 
abundance of Desulfovibrio after transfer of old microbiota. 
Interestingly, Desulfovibrio and TM7 bacteria have recently been 
associated with a compromised intestinal barrier due to an altered

mucus structure that was more penetrable by bacteria leading to 
increased intestinal immune infiltration (46). Further indications 
that TM7 phyla and Proteobacteria such as Desulfovibrio can 
contribute to intestinal inflammation comes from observations 
that these bacteria are associated with the pathogenesis of IBD 
(47–49). In conclusion, our data seem to support the hypothesis 
that the altered gut microbiota composition in aged individuals 
contributes at least partially to the chronic low-grade inflamma-
tory state observed during aging. Therefore, strategies to modify 
gut microbiota composition of the elderly with, for example, 
probiotics or prebiotics (50) might help to reduce inflammation 
and thereby promote healthy aging.
