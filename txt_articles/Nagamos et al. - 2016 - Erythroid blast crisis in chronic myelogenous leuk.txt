Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder where over a period of time 15–
20% of patients show blastic transformation with majority transforming into acute myeloid leukemia,
most of which are of granulocytic lineage. Erythroid blast phase of CML is relatively rare with the in-
cidence ranging from 0–10%. Further the incidence of acute erythroid leukemia by itself is fairly low
amongst all acute leukemias. We report a case of 41-year-old patient with CML who failed to achieve
cytogenetic remission, transformed to acute erythroid leukemia and eventually succumbed to the disease
over a short period of time. Related literature is also reviewed

1. Case description
A 41-year-old woman prompted a visit to an optometrist due to
blurred vision in June 2013, and was diagnosed to have retinal
hemorrhage. Complete blood count revealed marked leukocytosis
(326 K/mL), neutrophilia (25%, 64.6 K/mL) with a prominent mye-
locyte peak (27.5% myelocytes), basophilia (4.0%, 12.9 K/mL), and
mild normocytic anemia (Hemoglobin 10.4 g/dl). Bone marrow
study revealed hyperplastic myeloid series (myeloid/erythroid ra-
tio of 8.1/1) with only 1.2% blasts. Further both karyotype and FISH
analysis revealed presence of Philadelphia chromosome in nearly
all cells (Fig. 1A and B) Based on these findings patient was diag-
nosed with Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic phase. She
was started on Imatinib 400 mg daily and hydroxyurea. Despite
achieving hematological remission three months after diagnosis,
patient continued to have persistent cytogenetic disease as de-
tected on follow up FISH assays with 32% cells showing t (9; 22). In
June 2014, patient was switched to Nilotinib, as she appeared to
have Imatinib resistant disease, although molecular testing for ABL
kinase mutational analysis was negative. In July 2015 repeat blood
work was done as patient complained of progressive fatigue and
menorrhagia. CBC done at that time revealed a normal white cell
count of 9.1 K/mL with 17.5% circulating blasts, (Fig. 1C) and he-
moglobin of 7.5 g/dL. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy was
performed and the specimen was also submitted for flow cyto-
metry and cytogenetic analysis. Prominent erythroid hyperplasia
was noted on the bone marrow aspirate smears with 69.5% ery-
throid precursors, several of which showed dysplastic features
(Fig. 1D–F). Although only 9% blasts were counted on the bone
marrow differential count, flow cytometry revealed 14% cells in the
blast gate (Fig. 1G) mostly expressing myeloid markers CD117,
CD33, stem cell marker CD34 and with partial aberrant expression
of lymphoid marker CD7. Bone marrow biopsy sections revealed
marked architectural disarray with prominent erythroid hyper-
plasia (Fig. 1H) and normal number of megakaryocytes several of
which were small and unilobed. Although no solid sheets of blasts
were seen, CD34 highlighted scattered blasts throughout the
biopsy section with a variable distribution estimated at approxi-
mately 10–15% (Fig. 1I). Both karyotype and FISH analysis revealed
presence of Philadelphia chromosome. Additionally monosomy
7 was detected in 82% of the cells (Fig. 1J and K) and chromosome
3 anomaly was also noted. Based on the presence of marked ery-
throid hyperplasia (69.5%) and 9% bone marrow blasts the diag-
nostic criteria for acute erythroid/myeloid leukemia were met and
a diagnosis of blast transformation of underlying CML to acute
erythroid/myeloid leukemia was made.
Patient received 7þ3 induction chemotherapy with Idarubicin
and Cytoxan. Despite lowering of her peripheral blood counts
patient continued to have persistent circulating peripheral blasts.
She further developed subarachnoid hemorrhage, and septicemia
and subsequently died six weeks after her hospitalization.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a clonal disorder
involving the pluripotent stem cell and is consistently associated

 with the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene located on the Philadelphia
chromosome [1]. The disease typically evolves in 3 distinct
clinical stages: chronic and accelerated phases and blast crisis. In
approximately 70% of cases, the blast lineage is myeloid, of which
granulocytic and monocytic blasts are more common. The
remaining 20–30% of cases show lymphoblast proliferation. Er-
ythroid blast phase of CML is relatively rare and a literature
review suggests that the incidence ranges from 0% to 10% [2].
Acute erythroid leukemia is a rare subtype (o5%) of acute
myeloid leukemia that may arise de novo or from transformation
of an underlying myelodysplastic syndrome. It is further sub-
divided into two subtypes namely: acute erythroleukemia and
pure erythroid leukemia. Unlike pure erythroid leukemia in which
the erythroid series is mostly comprised of proerythroblasts and

 basophilic erythroblasts, in acute erythroleukemia (erythroid/
myeloid) all maturation stages of the erythroid precursors are
present (comprise 450% of the entire nucleated cell population),
may frequently show a shift to immaturity, are dyspoietic and
myeloblasts comprise greater than 20% of non-erythroid cells [1].
Chronic myelogenous leukemia with erythroid crisis is a rare
entity with variable reported incidence rates [2]. Based on our
review of literature we came across very few reported cases of
transformation of underlying CML to acute erythroid leukemia
[3–8]. We also searched our institutional database for all cases of
CML that transformed to acute leukemia over the course of last
twenty years and did not find any other CML patient with ery-
throid blast crisis. Whether the criteria listed for diagnosis of
erythroleukemia should be applied in CML erythroid blast phase
is poorly defined. Some studies have considered the percentage
of normoblasts below 50% as criteria for erythroblast phase but
not erythroleukemia [6]. Although acute erythroid leukemia is
far less common than CML erythroblast crisis, a few cases of
Philadelphia-positive acute erythroid leukemia have been re-
ported [5]. Studies have also suggested that erythroid blast phase
is not independent of CML chronic phase. McFarlane and Tseih
[6] were able to demonstrate a ‘bcr-abl’ fusion product in the
normoblasts of CML, which provides concrete evidence con-
firming erythroid leukemia rather than a hyperplastic process. In
our case at the time of disease progression in 2015 we were able
to demonstrate presence of both bcr-abl fusion and monosomy
7 in majority of the bone marrow cells that on morphology were
mostly erythroid precursors by FISH assays. Although the 9; 22
translocation was seen at the time of diagnosis, the anomalies of
chromosome 7 and 3 were newly acquired in 2015, indicating
karyotype evolution and disease progression. In the blastic phase
of CML, several additional chromosome aberrations in addition to
the Philadelphia chromosome have been reported in 75–80% of
patients [3,5,7]. Complex rearrangements are widely dominant in
acute erythroleukemia with clonal abnormalities mostly invol-
ving chromosomes 5 and 7 followed by 8, 16 and 21 [3]. There is
no chromosome abnormality specific to erythroleukemia. In our
patient we found anomalies of chromosomes 3 and 7 as her
disease progressed.
pH-positive acute erythroid leukemia represents an even less
common occurrence than erythroid blast phase CML. It is difficult
to distinguish the erythroblast phase of CML from a pH-positive
acute leukemia [9]. Although complex karyotype and presence of
multiple chromosomal abnormalities is fairly common in all cases
of acute erythroleukemia, very few cases of pH-positive ery-
throleukemia have been reported [5]. Blast phase of CML is often
associated with a complex karyotype, including trisomy 8 and 19,
double pH chromosomes, and isochromosome i (17q) [10,11]. The
WHO classification does not specifically address the issue of ery-
throid hyperplasia in patients with CML or erythroid blast phase of
CML. We feel due to presence of more than 50% erythroid pre-
cursors and increased myeloblasts (greater than 20% of the non-
erythroid cells) our case meets the WHO diagnostic criteria for
acute erythroleukemia (erythroid/myeloid). The criteria for diag-
nosing acute erythroleukemia arising from an underlying CML
have not been firmly established, partly due to the rare occurrence
of this phenomenon.
Chronic myelogenous leukemia blast crisis is highly refractory
to standard induction chemotherapy, with a response rate of less
than 20–30% [12,13]. In patient's with Imatinib resistant disease
Dastanib and Nilotinib can help achieve hematological response
however neither drug has been reported to be entirely effective
in achieving complete cytogenetic remission or for treatment of
blast crisis [14]. Further acute erythroid leukemia has an ag-
gressive clinical course mostly with an adverse clinical outcome.
Blast crisis with erythroblast phase is rare and remains a chal-
lenge to treat.
