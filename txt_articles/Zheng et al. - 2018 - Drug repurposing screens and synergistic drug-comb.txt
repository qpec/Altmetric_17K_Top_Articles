Infectious diseases account for nearly one fifth of the worldwide death toll every year. The continuous increase of drug-resistant
pathogens is a big challenge for treatment of infectious diseases. In addition, outbreaks of infections and new pathogens are
potential threats to public health. Lack of effective treatments for drug-resistant bacteria and recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika
viral infections have become a global public health concern. The number of newly approved antibiotics has decreased signifi-
cantly in the last two decades compared with previous decades. In parallel with this, is an increase in the number of drug-resistant
bacteria. For these threats and challenges to be countered, new strategies and technology platforms are critically needed. Drug
repurposing has emerged as an alternative approach for rapid identification of effective therapeutics to treat the infectious dis-
eases. For treatment of severe infections, synergistic drug combinations using approved drugs identified from drug repurposing
screens is a useful option which may overcome the problem of weak activity of individual drugs. Collaborative efforts including
government, academic researchers and private drug industry can facilitate the translational research to produce more effective
new therapeutic agents such as narrow spectrum antibiotics against drug-resistant bacteria for these global challenges.

 Introduction
Since the discovery and application of antibiotics and vac-
cines, the mortality rate across the world has been dramati-
cally reduced. However, infectious diseases still caused
approximately 20% of deaths in 2010 (Lozano et al., 2012)
and remain as a medical challenge to physicians and health
organizations. The emergence and re-emergence of infections
caused by HIV, Ebola virus and Zika virus has put great pres-
sure on the development of vaccines and new specific thera-
peutics. The rapid appearances of drug-resistant pathogens
such as drug-resistant bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses
have been widely reported (Snitkin et al., 2012; Ashley et al.,
2014; McCarthy, 2016; Takeda et al., 2017).
Development of new therapeutic agents and vaccines
usually takes a long time and requires immense resources.
Vaccine development typically takes 10 to 15 years. The Vac-
cine Adverse Event Reporting System receives approximately
30 000 reports annually, in which 10–15% are classified as se-
rious medical events. Effective vaccines are still not available
for many infectious diseases such as malaria, HIV, Ebola virus
and Zika virus. The traditional process of development for a
new low MW drug usually requires an average of 10 to 12 years
and costs hundreds of millions of dollars (Sun et al., 2016a).
Development of new broad spectrum antibiotics is increas-
ingly difficult. Thus, alternative approaches, such as drug
repurposing, are needed to meet the challenges of outbreaks
and the emergence of drug-resistant infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases
Based on the identity of a pathogen, infectious diseases can be
categorized into four major classes: bacterial infections, fun-
gal infections, viral infections and protozoan infections.
Many of these infections still do not have effective therapeu-
tic agents. Another major challenge in infectious diseases is
the rising incidence of drug resistance of these pathogens. In
the last 5 years, there were several outbreaks of severe infec-
tious diseases, including these caused by the carbapenem-
resistant
Klebsiella
pneumoniae
(Snitkin
et
al.,
2012),
Exserohilum rostratum in contaminated methylprednisolone so-
lutions (Kainer et al., 2012), Ebola virus (Carroll et al., 2015),
Zika virus (Heymann et al., 2016; Kreuels et al., 2014) and the
emerging artemisinin-resistant malaria (Ariey et al., 2014).
The speed of developing new therapies for drug-resistant
pathogens has not kept up with the evolution of drug resis-
tance by these pathogens. Currently, 194 low MW drugs
and 10 biological agents are on the list of Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved drugs available for systemic
use to treat infectious diseases (Santos et al., 2017). In
addition, a total of 79 approved vaccine products are
available for the prevention of infectious diseases (available
from http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/) (online
accessed: 30th January 2017).
Discovery and development of new
antibiotics – issues and new approaches
Most antibiotics were developed in the 1960s and 1970s by
screening natural products and chemicals derived from
semi-synthesis with phenotypic screening methods (Power,
2006). Drug-resistant bacteria quickly emerged because of
the extensive uses of antibiotics against various infections,
especially the overuse and misuse of broad spectrum anti-
biotics (Granizo et al., 2000; Woodford et al., 2014). Anti-
biotics become less effective for treatment of infections
due to the increase in drug-resistant bacteria. With the ad-
vance of molecular biology and bacterial genome analysis,
target-based drug discovery developed into a a major path
for antibiotic drug discovery in the 1990s (Broughton and
Queener, 1991). High-throughput screening of the bacte-
rial targets was carried out in many companies. A number
of lead compounds were identified and optimized. How-
ever, a decade-long effort did not produce the expected re-
sults. Only a few compounds derived from target-based
screening campaigns advanced to late-stage development.
One of the reasons for this failure was the inability of
these lead compounds to cross the bacterial cell wall. A
second
reason
was
that
the
narrow
spectrum
of
the
antibactericidal activities of these lead compounds did
not meet the requirement for further development (Fan
et al., 2002; Jarvest et al., 2002; Payne et al., 2002). The
number of antibiotics approved by the FDA has steadily
decreased in the last two decades, while the total number
of new molecular entities has remained about the same
(Figure 1A).
Classically, antibiotics inhibit bacterial growth and kill
bacteria via inhibition of a key enzyme or an essential process
in the bacterial life cycle. The five main bacterial processes
that are involved in the mechanisms of action for antibiotics
include cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis,
DNA-directed RNA polymerase and essential metabolic en-
zymes (Coates et al., 2002). Based on the selectivity against
different types of bacteria, antibiotics are divided into
broad-spectrum antibiotics that suppress a wide range of bac-
teria including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative and
narrow-spectrum antibiotics that are only active against
small groups of bacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-
positive bacteria.
Drug-resistant bacteria have developed a wide range of
mechanisms to alter their susceptibility to antibiotics. Reduc-
tion of drug entry, decrease of intracellular drug concentra-
tions
by
increasing
efflux,
inactivation/modification
of
drugs, bypass of metabolic pathways and alteration of drug
binding sites are mechanisms commonly involved in the
drug resistance of bacteria (Lewis, 2013). New drugs have
been developed to overcome some specific drug-resistant
mechanisms. For example, clavulanic acid (Wise et al.,
1978), sulbactam (Retsema et al., 1980), tazobactam (Jacobs
et al., 1986) and avibactam (Stachyra et al., 2009) are the
β-lactamase inhibitors that are used in combinations with
β-lactam
antibiotics
to
overcome
the
resistance
of
β-
lactamase-producing bacteria.
The pharmaceutical industry has primarily focused on the
development of broad spectrum antibiotics in the last two de-
cades and abandoned narrow spectrum lead compounds. The
main reason for only developing broad spectrum antibiotics
is the financial return on investment from such new drugs.
The new broad spectrum antibiotics can be used more fre-
quently in clinics, as they have more indications, and are
suitable for early intervention in infections. A critical fiscal

 goal of drug development is to find ‘blockbuster drugs’ or new
therapies that earn at least $1 billion in annual return.
Orphan drugs, often developed for rare diseases that affect
less than 200 000 people in the U.S., offer less financial re-
wards than blockbuster drugs. With the limited patient popu-
lation, it is more difficult to recover the cost for drug
development from pharmaceutical sales. Narrow spectrum
antibiotics face the same hurdles: antibiotics indicated for a
small group of bacteria usually do not offer a big market
share. Hence, the monetary incentive to develop this type
of drug is too low to be profitable.
As a result of the disappointment in producing new anti-
biotics, many pharmaceutical companies decreased their at-
tempts to discover new antibiotic drugs in the early 2000s.
This trend of reduced effort in antibiotic drug discovery by
the industry continues, while the prevalence of drug-
resistant bacteria such as salmonellae increase every year, al-
though some others such campylobacters and Escherichia coli
did not change significantly (Figure 1B). Development of new
drugs requires a significant amount of resources and time.
Waiting to act is dangerous; the crisis of infections by drug-
resistant bacteria is an emerging threat to public health.
Hence, new strategies and technologies for antibiotic devel-
opment and treatment of infectious diseases are critically
needed. To inspire the development of new anti-infective
treatments, the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development
provides incentives (including fiscal ones) for sponsors to de-
velop drugs for limited patient populations.
Phenotypic screening has re-emerged as an alternative ap-
proach for drug discovery in recent years (Zheng et al., 2013).
In contrast to mechanism-based drug discovery, phenotypic
screening enables identification of active compounds that
function by killing bacteria or inhibiting bacterial growth.
For antibiotic drug development, specific strains of drug-
resistant bacteria can be used in the primary compound
screens, employing a phenotypic growth assay to identify
new bactericidal compounds. The spectrum of initially iden-
tified active compounds can be determined quickly in the
follow-up confirmation experiments by screening additional
strains of bacteria. The mechanisms of action of the identified
active compounds are typically unknown after the pheno-
typic screen. If the newly identified compounds are approved
drugs, the known functions of these drugs may provide some
useful clues for the study of the mechanism of action. Pheno-
typic screening has not been extensively used in high-
throughput screens against large collections of compounds
for antibiotic drug discovery as the mechanism-based drug
screening was the main approach in last two decades. The dis-
covery of new bacterial genes and resistance plasmids further
fuelled this target-based drug discovery effort, as well as the
completion of bacterial genome mapping in the middle of
1990s (Kunst et al., 1997). The phenotypic approach mea-
sures an actual biological response. Hence, phenotypic
screens are more useful for identifying lead compounds with
selective and narrow spectrums that target specific drug-
resistant bacteria. A combination of phenotypic screening
using patient-derived bacterial samples and drug repurposing
could potentially identify new therapeutic agents to treat in-
fections caused by drug-resistant bacteria.
Drug repurposing
Drug repurposing of approved drugs provides an alternative
method for rapid identification of new therapeutic agents to
treat infections with drug-resistant bacteria and other emerg-
ing infectious diseases. The data for human pharmacokinet-
ics and drug safety, as well as the preclinical results, are
readily available for approved drugs. In the traditional drug
development process, approximately one third of investiga-
tional drugs failed in clinical trials due to unexpected human
toxicity and another one third failed due to lack of efficacy
(Petrova, 2014). Repurposing approved drugs should avoid
attrition
in
clinical
trials
due
to
drug
toxicity
and
unfavourable issues in pharmacokinetics. The approved
drugs found in drug repurposing screens can be advanced to

and 1987 to 2 between 2008 and 2012. In 2012, the Generating Antibiotic Incentives (Durand et al., 2016) was signed into law, which may have
contributed to the increase of approved antibiotics between 2013 and 2016. The period *2013–2016 covers 4 years. Total new molecular entities
(NMEs) are above 100 during every 5-year span between 1983 and 2016. (B) Increase of drug-resistant Salmonella typhi, Campylobacter coli and

 clinical trials or treatments quickly without prolonged pre-
clinical study and a phase I clinical trial. A new indication
of an FDA-approved drug qualifies the existing drug for a line
extension. Currently, approximately 1500 US FDA-approved
drugs are available for the treatments of a variety of diseases
(Figure 2A). We conducted a pharmacological function
search for each drug in Medical Subject Headings and other
literature in December 2016. The majority of approved drugs
are those for non-infective indications. Among the approved
drugs, 310 showed anti-infective activities comprising 178
antibacterial agents, 41 antifungal agents, 70 antiviral agents,
27 anti-parasitic agents and 18 other anti-infective agents
(anthelmintic and antiprotozoal) (Figure 2B). At the National
Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, the approved
drug collection has been expanded to a larger collection: the
NCGC Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC) (Huang et al.,
2011). The NPC consists of approximately 2750 active low
MW compounds including human drugs and animal drugs
as well as investigational drugs being used in clinical trials.
This collection will be updated periodically by the addition
of
newly
approved
drugs.
While
known
antibiotics
previously indicated for other bacteria can be directly applied
for treatments of newly identified bacterial infections, a clin-
ical trial is usually needed for treatment of infectious diseases
with drugs approved for non-infective indications.
Due to commercial concerns, the pharmaceutical indus-
try historically has lacked an interest in repurposing off-
patent old drugs and/or exploring applications of approved
drugs for unpredicted outbreaks of infectious diseases, such
as the outbreak of Ebola virus. Therefore, drug repurposing
for treatment of infectious diseases benefits from funding
support through governments and foundations, as well as
the collaborations between academic institutions and private
industry.
Some successes have been achieved by repurposing anti-
infective drugs for treatment of infectious diseases (Table 1).
Enoxacin, a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibacterial
agent approved for treatment of urinary tract infections and
gonorrhoea,
showed
antifungal
activity
in
both
a
Caenorhabditis elegans assay and a murine model of candidia-
sis (Bregeret al., 2007). Delamanid, a drug for tuberculosis, ex-
hibited activity against visceral leishmaniasis (Patterson et al.,
2016). More recently, niclosamide, an anti-worm medicine,
showed potent activity against the Zika virus (Xu et al., 2016).
Drugs that are not originally approved to treat an infec-
tious disease have also been reported to inhibit infections
caused by various pathogens. Auranofin, a gold-containing
compound used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,
has been repurposed for several pathogens. The mechanism
of action employed by auranofin is the inhibition of host or
pathogen’s thioredoxin reductases (Figure 3). It showed
good
activities
against
multidrug-resistant
bacteria,
including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
and K. pneumoniae (Harbut et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2016b).
Auranofin also exhibited activities against other diseases in-
cluding HIV/AIDS (Chirullo et al., 2013), and some parasitic
diseases (Debnath et al., 2012), as well as Alzheimer’s disease,
Parkinson’s disease (Madeira et al., 2013; Madeira et al.,
2014) and cancer (Fiskus et al., 2014). Notably, auranofin
was evaluated in human clinical studies for gastrointestinal
protozoa, HIV, and cancer. Additionally, loperamide, a di-
arrhoea drug, was repurposed against Salmonella enterica
(Ejim et al., 2011). The breast cancer drug tamoxifen
showed efficacy in a murine model of cryptococcosis (Butts
et al., 2014). Chlorcyclizine, an old antihistamine, was
repurposed
for
the
treatment
of
infections
by
the
hepatitis C virus (He et al., 2015).
Assays for drug repurposing screens
Although a mechanism-based assay can be used for drug
repurposing screens, phenotypic screening of intact patho-
gens with the approved drug collection is more physiologi-
cally relevant for drug repurposing. The active compounds
identified from phenotypic screening with bacterial strains
can be tested directly in the animal models or in clinical tri-
als. A number of cell viability assays are available for pheno-
typic screening of bacteria including absorbance growth
assays (Highlander, 1997), ATP content assays (Sun et al.,
2016b) and resazurin reduction assays (Foerster et al., 2017).
These assays are robust and amenable to high-throughput

 dilution assays with low throughput in which the minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of confirmed compounds is
determined. Generally, the IC90 values have correlated well
with MICs (Munck et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2016b).
One of the main drawbacks for drug repurposing is that
the new activity identified for an approved drug is usually
not potent enough for the intended clinical application
(Sun et al., 2016a). For example, the repurposed drug is not
therapeutically effective at its approved dose due to the lim-
ited human plasma concentrations. A higher dosage of
repurposed drug is needed for the new indication, which
can lead to undesired toxicity. From the perspective of clinical
pharmacology, each drug is effective and safe in the approved
drug dosage that allows a steady drug concentration in hu-
man plasma. All drugs can be toxic or cause severe adverse ef-
fects
if
drug
dosage
is
too
high
and
plasma
drug
concentration is above the safety threshold. Drug potencies
(EC50 or IC50 values) can be obtained in drug repurposing
screens, while the pharmacokinetic parameters of approved
drugs, Cmax (maximum drug concentration recorded in hu-
man blood or plasma), can be found in published papers
(Schulz
and
Schmoldt,
2003)
or
databases,
such
as
DailyMed
(https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/index.
cfm) and NDAs at drugs@FDA (http://www.accessdata.fda.
gov/scripts/cder/daf/).
One solution to the problem of insufficient drug concen-
trations in human plasma is to utilize synergistic drug combi-
nations, which will be discussed in the next section. Another
remedy is to conduct extensive preclinical development and
new clinical trials for the repurposing drug candidates in or-
der to find new optimal dosing and formulation. Approved
anti-infective agents identified from the repurposing screen
may be used immediately to treat patients with severe infec-
tions for which they were not developed initially (Bassetti
et al., 2011). Conversely, non-anti-infective drugs such as an-
tihypertensive and antihistamine agents, once found from
drug repurposing screens, typically do need new clinical trials
to demonstrate their safety and efficacy for the treatment of
infections (He et al., 2015).
Synergistic drug combinations for
infectious diseases
Drug combinations have been used for treatment of a variety
of diseases including infectious diseases. There are several
advantages of drug combinations. First, drug combinations
expand the spectrum of antibiotics for a broader coverage of
pathogens. This is important for severe infections where early
and effective treatment is critical (Zilberberg et al., 2014).
Second, drug combinations are effective in overcoming drug
resistance (Fleisher et al., 1983; Houang et al., 1984; Qin
et al., 2017). For example, β-lactams are effective against
many sensitive bacterial strains but not the β-lactamase pro-
ducing resistant bacteria which hydrolyzes the β-lactam anti-
biotics and inactivates them. Addition of a β-lactamase
inhibitor to a β-lactam antibiotic in treatments effectively
overcomes this type of drug resistance. Third, prudent use
of drug combinations may reduce the development of antibi-
otic resistance (Levin, 2002; Mahamat et al., 2007; Aldeyab
et al., 2008). Fourth, combinations of two or more drugs
may lead to a synergistic effect, which is achieved by different
mechanisms of action. Examples include the combinations
of streptomycin–penicillin (Plotz and Davis, 1962) and
trimethoprim–sulfa drugs against E. coli (Nichols et al.,
2011)
as
well
as
the
unexpected
synergism
between
minocycline and non-antibiotics (Ejim et al., 2011).
Synergistic drug combination is particularly useful for
drug repurposing because many active compounds identified
from phenotypic screens have weak activities and cannot be
directly applied in humans as a single agent. In a recent
screen, we found 25 approved drugs with activities against
the drug-resistant K. pneumoniae (Sun et al., 2016b). Many
newly identified drugs have not been used for drug-resistant
K. pneumoniae previously, and more than a half of them were
not antibiotics. The potency of these 25 drugs was not high
enough for the clinical use as a single agent due to the limited
drug concentration in human plasma. A new drug combina-
tion screen led to identification of synergistic drug combina-
tions against the drug-resistant K. pneumoniae. Seventeen
three-drug combinations were effective against the drug-
resistant pathogen at clinically reachable individual drug
concentrations. Another group also reported the strong syn-
ergy
between
meropenem,
piperacillin
and
tazobactam
against MRSA (Gonzales et al., 2015). The concentrations of
individual drugs in the combinations are lower than the clin-
ical susceptibility break points that are required for the clini-
cal applications. Hence, treatment with drug combinations is
an important consideration for the treatment of multidrug-
resistant bacteria (Table 2A). In another example, 53 ap-
proved drugs were identified with activities against the Ebola
virus in a drug repurposing screen (Kouznetsova et al., 2014).
Similarly, the activity of most of the 53 drugs was too weak to
be used in patients with Ebola infection as a single agent. We
then carried out a new screening of synergistic drug combina-
tions with individual drug concentrations relevant to human
plasma concentrations. Several three-drug combinations
with the clinically relevant drug concentrations that effec-
tively suppressed Ebola virus infection in vitro were identified
(Sun et al., 2017) (Table 2B and Figure 4).
Current treatment of bacterial infections commonly em-
ploys a broad-spectrum antibiotic agent until a pathogen
can be isolated and identified and antimicrobial susceptibil-
ity testing is completed, a process which takes 3 to 4 days.
The methods of antimicrobial susceptibility testing for clini-
cal diagnosis include broth microdilution, agar dilution,
rapid automated instrument methods, disk diffusion and gra-
dient diffusion methods (Jorgensen and Ferraro, 2009)
(Table 3). Limited numbers of antibiotics, approximately 25,
can be tested with the current methods in clinical diagnostic
laboratories. It is not possible to use these methods for phe-
notypic screening of approved drug collection, or even a set
of 200 antibiotics. They are also not suitable for testing of op-
timal drug combinations from hundreds of drug combina-
tions in two-drug and three-drug combination formats.
Several new methods have been under investigation for anti-
microbial susceptibility testing (Smith and Kirby, 2016b; Sun
et al., 2016b; van Belkum and Dunne, 2013) (Table 3). Im-
provement of the current antimicrobial susceptibility testing
methods or invention of new methods is needed to meet the
challenge of drug-resistant bacteria. Recent advances include
the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of

Perspectives
Currently, broad-spectrum antibiotics are usually used in
clinical treatment of bacterial infections until a pathogen
can be isolated/identified and an effective antibiotic agent is
found. In many cases, the broad-spectrum antibiotics are
used through the entire course of treatment. The overuse of
broad-spectrum antibiotics actually contributes to develop-
ment of drug resistance in pathogens as well as in many

 non-harmful or less pathogenic bacteria. To avoid this unnec-
essary
generation
of
resistance,
effective
and
narrow-
spectrum antibiotics might be the first choice for treatment
of infections if the pathogens can be diagnosed quickly with
new methods such as the bacterial genome sequencing tech-
nology (Dekker and Frank, 2016).
Effective narrow-spectrum antibiotics can be a good
choice for treatment of infections with drug-resistant bacte-
ria. Although narrow-spectrum antibiotics may not have a
big market initially, their usage can increase with an improve-
ment in antimicrobial susceptibility testing and an applica-
tion
of
drug
combination
therapy.
Narrow-spectrum
antibiotics or lead compounds can be found by phenotypic
screens of approved drug collection and other compound col-
lections against individual drug-resistant pathogens. The
leads can then be optimized and developed through an
accelerated drug development process. Because of the small
market and high costs associated with the development of
narrow-spectrum antibiotics, a collaborative consortium of
government, academic institutes and private drug industry
may be needed for such an effort. For example, the National
Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National
Institutes of Health in the United States has initiated a new
drug repositioning model with three-way partnerships be-
tween public funders, the pharmaceutical industry and aca-
demic investigators (Frail et al., 2015). Involvement of
government funders facilitates translational research and
‘de-risks’ these drug development projects which have a
small, unprofitable share of the market.
Currently, initial treatment of infectious diseases is almost
always based on a preliminary clinical diagnosis of potential
pathogens. The individual responses and the genetic back-
ground of patients to antimicrobial treatment are usually
either not or less frequently considered. Variations in the
genetic background of individuals contribute to adverse
effects of drug treatment as well as the therapeutic effects.
Varied patient responses to drug treatments may also be
caused by the interaction of pathogens with the microbiome
of patients (Schwab and Schaeffeler, 2012; Nirmal Kumar
Ganguly, 2013; Chaudhry et al., 2016). Therefore, a personal-
ized treatment for infectious diseases with consideration of
pharmacogenomics is a future direction for combating severe
infections and infections with drug-resistant bacteria which
may increase the therapeutic efficacy, reduce adverse effects
and decrease the possibility of developing drug resistance.
To improve the current treatment methods and to estab-
lish new treatment approaches for infectious diseases, physi-
cians will need new antibiotics and technologies. These
include more choices of narrow-spectrum antimicrobials
and better diagnostic methods for pathogens, genome se-
quencing and analysis tools, and rapid antimicrobial suscep-
tibility testing methods with real-time and high-throughput
capacity. In particular, the current methods of antimicrobial
susceptibility testing in clinical diagnostics are based on
methods developed over 40 years ago. Unsurprisingly, these
approaches do not have enough throughput and capacity
for compound screening and cannot accommodate the need
for screening of synergistic drug combinations. Moderniza-
tion of the methods of testing for antimicrobial susceptibility
is needed to meet the challenges of treating of infectious dis-
eases. The bacterial growth assay in a miniaturized format
(384- or 1536-well plates) (van Belkum and Dunne, 2013;
Smith and Kirby, 2016a; Sun et al., 2016b) or a chip-based
method can be developed and optimized for this purpose.
Only a short time (8 - 10 h) is needed for determination of ef-
fective antimicrobial agents and effective drug combinations
in the bacterial growth assay with an absorbance assay format
(Sun et al., 2016b). New methods for rapid diagnosis of path-
ogens (10 h or less) such as genome sequencing of pathogens
are also needed (van Belkum and Dunne, 2013; Dekker and
Frank, 2016). The data should be quickly analysed to reveal
the nature of pathogens and the information of drug suscep-
tibility for a particular pathogen. In addition, pathogens
should be quickly isolated from patient samples to be used
in a rapid antimicrobial susceptibility test.
Conclusion
To treat the growing numbers of infections with drug-
resistant bacteria, phenotypic screens of an approved drug
collection as well as synergistic combinations are a useful ap-
proach for rapid identification of new therapeutics. This ap-
proach may also be useful for emerging outbreaks of
infectious diseases such as Ebola and Zika virus for which vac-
cines and therapeutic agents are unavailable and unrealistic
to be developed in a short period of time. Meanwhile, devel-
opment of new narrow-spectrum and selective antimicrobials
using the phenotypic screening approach is a feasible direc-
tion
to
combat
increasing
infections
of
drug-resistant
