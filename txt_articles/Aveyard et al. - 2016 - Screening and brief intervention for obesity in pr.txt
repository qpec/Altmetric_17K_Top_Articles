Summary
Background Obesity is a common cause of non-communicable disease. Guidelines recommend that physicians screen 
and off
 er brief advice to motivate weight loss through referral to behavioural weight loss programmes. However, 
physicians rarely intervene and no trials have been done on the subject. We did this trial to establish whether physician 
brief intervention is acceptable and eff
 ective for reducing bodyweight in patients with obesity. 
Methods In this parallel, two-arm, randomised trial, patients who consulted 137 primary care physicians in England 
were screened for obesity. Individuals could be enrolled if they were aged at least 18 years, had a body-mass index of at 
least 30 kg/m² (or at least 25 kg/m² if of Asian ethnicity) , and had a raised body fat percentage. At the end of the 
consultation, the physician randomly assigned participants (1:1) to one of two 30 s interventions. Randomisation was 
done via preprepared randomisation cards labelled with a code representing the allocation, which were placed in opaque 
sealed envelopes and given to physicians to open at the time of treatment assignment. In the active intervention, the 
physician off
 ered referral to a weight management group (12 sessions of 1 h each, once per week) and, if the referral was 
accepted, the physician ensured the patient made an appointment and off
 ered follow-up. In the control intervention, the 
physician advised the patient that their health would benefi
 t from weight loss. The primary outcome was weight change 
at 12 months in the intention-to-treat population, which was assessed blinded to treatment allocation. We also assessed 
asked patients’ about their feelings on discussing their weight when they have visited their general practitioner for other 
reasons. Given the nature of the intervention, we did not anticipate any adverse events in the usual sense, so safety 
outcomes were not assessed. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, number ISRCTN26563137.
Findings Between June 4, 2013, and Dec 23, 2014, we screened 8403 patients, of whom 2728 (32%) were obese. Of these 
obese patients, 2256 (83%) agreed to participate and 1882 were eligible, enrolled, and included in the intention-to-treat 
analysis, with 940 individuals in the support group and 942 individuals in the advice group. 722 (77%) individuals 
assigned to the support intervention agreed to attend the weight management group and 379 (40%) of these individuals 
attended, compared with 82 (9%) participants who were allocated the advice intervention. In the entire study population, 
mean weight change at 12 months was 2·43 kg with the support intervention and 1·04 kg with the advice intervention, 
giving an adjusted diff
 erence of 1·43 kg (95% CI 0·89–1·97).  The reactions of the patients to the general practitioners’ 
brief interventions did not diff
 er signifi
 cantly between the study groups in terms of appropriateness (adjusted odds 
ratio 0·89, 95% CI 0·75–1·07, p=0·21) or helpfulness (1·05, 0·89–1·26, p=0·54); overall, four (<1%) patients thought 
their intervention was inappropriate and unhelpful and 1530 (81%) patients thought it was appropriate and helpful. 
Interpretation A behaviourally-informed, very brief, physician-delivered opportunistic intervention is acceptable to 
patients and an eff
 ective way to reduce population mean weight.

Introduction
Internationally, guidelines recommend that physicians 
screen for and opportunistically encourage patients to 
lose weight.1,2 However, patient surveys and recordings of 
consultations suggest that such guidelines are not widely 
implemented.3,4 Physicians report several barriers to 
action, including insuffi
  cient time and knowledge, belief 
that intervention would be ineff
 ective, and fear of causing 
off
 ence.5–8 However, patients seem to be open to receiving 
advice from their doctors.9
No randomised trials have investigated whether advice 
from physicians leads to weight loss in their patients. 
Systematic reviews of data from randomised trials show 
strong evidence that brief physician intervention is 
eff
 ective for smoking cessation and some evidence that it 
is eff
 ective at reducing problem drinking,10,11 suggesting 
that brief opportunistic interventions on behavioural risk 
factors can be eff
 ective. Cross-sectional data show that 
people who are attempting to lose weight are more likely 
to report having received advice from a physician than are 
people who aren’t trying to lose weight.12–14 However, 
recordings of consultations show that it is the patient, not 
the doctor, who instigates half of these discussions,4 
which could explain the association; patients motivated to

lose weight seek help from their physician. We therefore 
did a trial to test the eff
 ectiveness of physicians screening 
for and opportunistically intervening on obesity.
Methods
Study design and participants
The full trial protocol has been reported previously15 and 
is available online. The protocol was implemented 
without changes. This study was a parallel, two-arm, 
randomised trial of a brief intervention for obesity in 
primary care, which involved the participation of 
137 primary care physicians at 57 practices from across 
the south of England. The trial was approved by the NHS 
Research Ethics Service.
Study researchers attended participating primary care 
practices and asked to weigh, measure, and estimate the 
body fat of every patient waiting to see a physician by use of 
a 
Tanita 
SC-240MA 
Body 
Composition 
Analyser 
(Tanita, Amsterdam, Netherlands). We sought informed 
consent from all patients. To be enrolled, participants 
needed to be aged at least 18 years, have a body-mass 
index (BMI) of at least 25 kg/m² if they were of Asian 
ethnicity16 or at least 30 kg/m² if they were of any other 
ethnic groups, and have a raised body fat percentage 
(defi
 ned in accordance with age and sex).17 Participants who 
declined participation were asked for anonymous data on 
their demographic characteristics and height and weight.
We excluded women who were pregnant or planning a 
pregnancy within 12 months, people who had undergone 
bariatric surgery at any time, people who had completed a 
weight management programme (pharmacotherapy or 
behavioural programme) within the past 3 months or 
were currently enrolled in one, people who were attending 
the physician to discuss weight, or people who could not 
speak English. People who consented and were eligible to 
participate were handed a randomisation envelope to give 
to the general practitioner (GP), which included an 
appended record of the patient’s height, weight, and BMI. 
Physicians could exclude people during the consultation, 
before opening the randomisation envelope (in which 
case the envelope was reused), if opportunistic 
intervention on weight was clinically inappropriate 
(eg, short life expectancy or a history of eating disorder), 
inappropriate in that consultation (eg, an emotional 
consultation), or for other exceptional reasons.
Randomisation and masking
An independent statistician used Stata Software 
version 12 to produce a randomisation list that was 
stratifi
 ed by physician, with random permuted blocks of 
four. The list was used to prepare randomisation cards, 
which were placed in opaque sealed envelopes. Neither 
the researchers nor the physicians enrolling participants 
were aware of the allocation for each potential participant. 
Once 
the 
physician 
opened 
the 
envelope, 
the 
randomisation card contained a two letter code showing 
the assigned intervention, which was either support or 
advice. Sealed envelopes provide a faster method of 
enacting randomisation than do any other methods, so it 
did not break the fl
 ow of the consultation.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
A US Preventive Services Task Force systematic review searched 
for studies of screening and opportunistic intervention on 
obesity up to September, 2010, and found no studies. On 
Sept 23, 2016, we updated this search in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, 
and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, restricted 
to articles published in English. We found no trials. 
International guidelines recommend that physicians screen for 
obesity and off
 er referral to eff
 ective weight management 
programmes. This recommendation is based on the results of 
randomised trials showing such programmes to be eff
 ective in 
people seeking treatment, but no trials have examined whether 
screening and opportunistic intervention in people not seeking 
support are eff
 ective or acceptable. Physicians rarely intervene 
opportunistically.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the fi
 rst trial of screening and 
opportunistic intervention on obesity in the world. We enrolled 
consecutive patients presenting to a primary care physician who 
were obese. We trained physicians to off
 er referral to an eff
 ective 
weight management programme, ensure that the patient left 
with an appointment, and off
 er follow-up, and to do so within 
30 s. In the control intervention, the physician advised the 
patient that their health would benefi
 t from weight loss. 
We showed that such brief interventions were highly acceptable, 
with most patients fi
 nding opportunistic intervention 
appropriate and helpful and very few fi
 nding it inappropriate 
and unhelpful. Moreover, the intervention group lost more than 
the control group at 12 months. Most people tried to lose 
weight during the year of follow-up, with only a small diff
 erence 
between groups. The diff
 erence in weight loss arose mainly 
because of the greater uptake of behavioural support for weight 
loss in the intervention group.
Implications of all the available evidence
Evidence suggests that physicians are concerned about 
off
 ending their patients by discussing weight, but qualitative 
evidence from patients and this trial in particular shows that 
they should be less concerned. If physicians act in accordance 
with the guidelines, patients are likely to welcome the 
intervention and lose a signifi
 cant amount of weight. 
Given that many patients consult their primary care physician 
at least once a year and most several times a year, this brief 
intervention has high reach, is practicable, and could reduce 
population mean weight.

Half of the randomisation cards also carried a request 
to record the consultation about weight, although 
patients were allowed to opt out or could request deletion 
afterwards. The sequence for random allocation of 
recording was prepared in exactly the same way as for 
allocation to intervention, but was independent of it.
Procedures
We considered and decided against using a control 
condition that off
 ered no intervention. Such a control 
would have compromised our ability to assess feelings 
about the intervention and compromised blinding. 
Instead, for the control, we used an intervention that 
physicians typically use when intervening on behavioural 
risk factors: advice to change behaviour to benefi
 t health.6 
Physicians were allowed to personalise this advice on the 
basis of their patient’s medical or family history.
The aims for the active intervention were that it would 
be eff
 ective, acceptable, and could be delivered in less 
than 30 s, to meet physicians’ concerns about imple-
mentation. The design of the intervention was informed 
by evidence that an off
 er of help to change is more 
motivating than advice to do so.18 We therefore 
encouraged physicians to off
 er referral to a weight loss 
service that has proven eff
 ective. Such programmes are 
widely available to primary-care physicians in England, 
are usually provided by commercial weight loss 
companies, and are the recommended fi
 rst-line 
intervention for obesity, having been shown to be 
eff
 ective.19–21 In this trial, these programmes were 
provided mainly by Slimming World (Alfreton, UK). 
When patients are referred for free through the NHS, the 
programme off
 ers 12 sessions consisting of 1 h of 
behavioural group support, once per week. Second, we 
drew on the results of a trial for smoking cessation that 
showed that brief opportunistic interventions en-
couraging patients to use a behavioural programme have 
a ten-times higher uptake when the referral is enacted by 
the system rather than leaving patients to instigate it.22 
We ensured that patients who agreed to referral left the 
practice with an appointment. Finally, we drew on 
evidence that external accountability is an important 
component of behavioural programmes23 and we trained 
physicians to ask the participant to return in 4 weeks to 
assess their progress (panel).
We trained physicians with a 90 min online course. The 
modules covered the rationale of the trial, the medical 
benefi
 ts of weight loss, and the mechanics of running the 
trial, but mostly consisted of fi
 lmed consultations with 
commentary to help physicians assimilate the skills 
necessary to deliver both interventions with confi
 dence. 
The course also trained physicians to handle diffi
  cult 
situations that might arise in consultations and what to 
do in follow-up consultations.
We assessed fi
 delity by recording randomly selected 
consultations (ie, consultations in which the random-
isation card included a request to record). After each 
physician’s session, the researcher listened to the 
recording and assessed whether key aspects of the 
intervention were delivered as intended. We provided 
feedback to physicians where necessary to improve 
fi
 delity. These recordings were prespecifi
 ed in the 
protocol analysis plan.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was weight change from baseline to 
12 months. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of 
participants who had lost 5% and 10% of their baseline 
body weight at 12 months and mean change in self-reported 
weight from baseline to 3 months. The secondary 
outcomes also included cost per kg, which is presented 
briefl
 y in the discussion, and cost per kg per m². We will 
present a fuller economic analysis in a separate paper. We 
used a checklist to code a convenience sample of the 
consultation recordings for the presence or absence of key 
aspects of the control and active interventions. Fidelity in 
the intervention group was assessed by recording whether 
or not an off
 er of referral was made and whether or not 
there 
was 
supporting 
discussion 
(for 
example, 
encouragement to attend, advice on the superiority of the 
service over trying alone). Fidelity in the control group was 
assessed on whether advice was given that linked weight 
loss to improved health and that no off
 er of referral to 
weight management was made. To assess patients 
perception of the interventions, participants completed 
two questions on their response to the physician’s brief 
intervention immediately after the consultation. At 
3 months, participants were telephoned by researchers 
blinded to allocation to assess their actions to manage 
weight. Researchers masked to allocation weighed 
participants at 12 months using the same Tanita device as 
Panel: Typical physician intervention
Physician: While you’re here, I just wanted to talk about your 
weight. You know the best way to lose weight is to go to 
[Slimming World or Rosemary Conley] and that’s available 
free on the NHS?
Patient: Oh?
Physician: Yes, and I can refer you now if you are willing to 
give that a try?
Patient: Yes, ok.
Physician: Ok, what you need to do is take this envelope back 
outside to the person who weighed you and they will book 
you into the weight loss course now.
Patient: Ok.
Physician: Good, but I’d like to see how you’re getting on, so 
come and see me again in 4 weeks, please. Ok?
Patient: Ok, see you then.

at baseline and again assessed participants’ actions on 
weight. These actions were classifi
 ed as no action, self-help 
measures (alterations to diet and activity), and more 
eff
 ective than self-help measures (attending a behavioural 
weight loss programme, taking orlistat, or following a 
meal-replacement weight loss programme). Finally, we 
also assessed physicians’ thoughts, feelings, and practice 
about giving opportunistic interventions on weight before 
and after participating in the trial. These outcomes will be 
reported separately. Given the nature of the intervention, 
we did not anticipate any adverse events in the usual sense 
so safety outcomes were not assessed.
Statistical analysis
Our sample size was based on the assumption that 
people lost to follow-up would be imputed as not having 
changed weight: ie, baseline observation carried forward 
(BOCF).24 Although the assumption is often made that 
people gain weight over time, this notion seems to be 
untrue for people who are overweight. The Prospective 
Studies Collaboration did a meta-analysis of data from 
72 000 participants with a BMI more than 30 kg/m² and 
their results showed modest weight loss, so BOCF 
seemed a reasonable and conservative approach.25 We 
assumed that we would be able to follow-up 70% of 
participants, that 30% of the participants would take up 
referral for weight management when off
 ered, and that 
in doing so these individuals would lose 3·5 kg at 1 year.19 
We assumed that 10% of the control group would aim to 
lose weight and achieve 1·2 kg weight loss.19 Assuming 
an SD for weight change of 6·0 kg,19 to achieve 90% power 
and 5% type I error, we would need to randomly assign 
912 people to each group, giving 1824 in total.
The primary analysis of weight change at 12 months 
was based on the intention-to-treat principle, with BOCF-
imputed values where data were missing. We used a 
linear mixed-eff
 ect model to assess weight change at 
12 months, adjusting for baseline weight as a fi
 xed eff
 ect 
and physician as a random eff
 ect. We also did a 
prespecifi
 ed sensitivity analyses that included complete 
case analysis and several other imputation methods to 
assess the robustness of the results. We used the same 
model to analyse weight change at 3 months. For the 
other secondary outcomes, proportion of patients 
losing 5% and 10% of baseline weight, we compared 
between groups with an analogous logistic model.
We summarised the appropriateness and helpfulness 
data separately and combined them to give the proportion 
of participants who thought the intervention was both 
inappropriate and unhelpful or appropriate and helpful 
to any degree, and we used a mixed-eff
 ects ordinal 
logistic regression model to compare between treatment 
groups. We analysed participants’ actions to manage 
their weight at 3 months and 12 months, which we 
categorised as no action, self-help, and eff
 ective action, 
with a similar ordinal logistic model. We present fi
 delity 
data descriptively by item.
All statistical analyses were done in accordance with a 
prespecifi
 ed analysis plan, which is available from the 
authors on request. We used Stata Software version 13·1 
for all analyses and we defi
 ned statistical signifi
 cance as a 
p value less than 0·05 (2 sided). This trial is registered 
with the ISRCTN Registry, number ISRCTN26563137
.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. PAv, AN, and L-MY had full access to all the 
data in the study and PAv had responsibility for the 
decision to submit.

action on weight, and physicians excluded 122 (5%) 
individuals, but mostly did not record the reason. 
940 participants were assigned to the support (active) 
intervention and 942 to the advice (control) intervention. 
One individual (<1%) assigned to the active intervention 
and three (<1%) individuals assigned to the control 
intervention received the intervention that was not 
assigned because of physician error, but were analysed as 
allocated (fi
 gure). We weighed 1419 (75%) of participants 
at the 12 month follow-up. 
Overall, the mean age of participants was 56·0 years 
(SD 16·1), 1076 (57·2%) of 1882 were women, and 
96 (5%) individuals were from minority ethnic groups. 
Mean weight was 104·6 kg (SD 15·7) for men and 
92·5 kg (15·3) for women, with a mean BMI of 
34·9 kg/m² (4·8). Characteristics were balanced between 
treatment groups (table 1). We found no large diff
 erences 
between the characteristics of people who declined 
participation or were ineligible and those included, 
except that women were slightly less likely to be willing 
to participate  (282 [17%] women vs 168 [16%] men were 
unwilling to participate).
Weight loss at 12 months, the primary outcome, was 
2·43 kg (SD 6·49) for the support group and 
1·04 kg (5·50) for the advice group, giving a diff
 erence of 
1·43 kg (95% CI 0·89–1·97, p<0·0001). Mean self-
reported weight loss at 3 months was 2·91 kg (5·16) for 
support and 1·18 kg (3·81) for advice, giving a diff
 erence 
of 1·76 kg (1·35–2·17, p<0·0001).
Overall, participants found the interventions both 
appropriate and helpful, with 1530 (81%) of 1882 individuals 
describing the intervention as both appropriate and 
helpful, whereas only four (<1%) individuals found the 
intervention inappropriate and unhelpful. The ratings that 
participants gave did not signifi
 cantly diff
 er between the 
support intervention and the control intervention (table 2).
As a result of the support intervention, 722 (77%) of 
940 participants accepted referral to the weight 
management programme and 379 (40%) attended an 
appointment, compared with 82 (9%) participants who 
were allocated the advice intervention. The odds of a 
patient taking eff
 ective action to manage their weight 
were signifi
 cantly higher in the support group than in 
the advice alone group (table 3). 
At 12 months, 238 (25%) of 940 participants in the 
support group had lost at least 5% of their bodyweight 
and 117 (12%) had lost at least 10%. These proportions 
were roughly double those in the control group (131 [14%] 
of 942 individuals lost 5% of bodyweight and 53 [6%] lost 
10% of bodyweight; table 4).
Physician fi
 delity was reasonably good (appendix). 
Physicians reported that patients very rarely re-attended 
for review. Listening to the recordings, these apparent 
failures are often explained by the direction of the 
consultation. For example, if on starting to describe the

possibility of referral to a weight management service, a 
patient made it clear that she or he would not want a 
referral, physicians would not go on to make a direct 
off
 er of referral in that case, which was appropriate. In 
18 (17%) of 106 recordings, physicians spoke to patients 
indirectly, using phrases such as “the trial would like to 
off
 er you referral”. Recordings of this kind were often 
marked by hesitancy and we interpret this inability to 
personally take ownership of the advice as refl
 ecting the 
physician’s nervousness about so directly addressing 
patients about their weight in the consultation. The last 
two elements of the brief intervention, asking patients to 
make an appointment at the weight management service 
and off
 ering follow-up, were intended only for people 
who accepted the initial referral: ie the 722 (77%) 
patients in the support group who accepted referral. 
Consequently, adherence to these referrals was somewhat 
higher than the fi
 gures suggest.
In our prespecifi
 ed sensitivity analyses, changing the 
assumptions about imputed weight for those lost to 
follow-up did not change the results of the primary 
analysis (appendix).
Discussion
A brief, 30 s, opportunistic intervention delivered by 
trained primary care physicians together with a support-
ive system meant that roughly 40% of patients attended 
the weight management group off
 ered and 54% of the 
patients assigned to the active intervention took eff
 ective 
action to manage their weight compared with 11% of 
the control participants. Consequently, participants 
who received advice and support lost 1·43 kg more 
than did those who received advice. Only four (<1%) 
people thought the opportunistic interventions were 
inappropriate and unhelpful and most participants 
thought the opposite, with no diff
 erence in response 
between treatment groups.
Previous studies on this topic have been cross-
sectional,26 so the major strength of this study is its 
prospective randomised design. Importantly, most 
eligible people participated in the trial and there were no 
substantial diff
 erences in the demographic profi
 le of 
those recruited and those who declined. However, the 
routine recruitment of participants and our desire to 
make the intervention from the physician truly 
opportunistic limited the information that we could 
collect at baseline; we did not obtain data on participants’ 
ratings of desire, intention, or confi
 dence to achieve 
weight loss. The absence of these data limits our ability 
to examine whether either intervention increased 
participants’ motivation to lose weight, although we 
excluded people who were already taking action to 
manage their weight, suggesting that we recruited people 
with low motivation to lose weight. Follow-up is diffi
  cult 
in weight loss trials, with typical 1 year follow-up of 63%.27 
In this trial, in which the population were not seeking 
help to lose weight, follow-up was particularly 
diffi
  cult, but we managed to measure the weights of 
1419 (75%) participants at 12 months; imputation with 
various methods and completer analysis did not change 
the fi
 ndings. The study participants were recruited from 
southern England and the only large conurbation that we 
recruited 
from 
was 
Bristol. 
Consequently, 
most 
participants were of white ethnicity. Although a range of 
people from diff
 erent socioeconomic circumstances 
were included, the study population was slightly more 
affl
  uent on average than the population of England as a 
whole. Whether the results can be generalised to other 
groups depends on whether the response to the 
physician’s intervention diff
 ers by socioeconomic or 
ethnic group and whether the response to the weight loss 
programme varies. Existing evidence20 suggests that no 
diff
 erences in response seem to exist by socioeconomic

or ethnic groups. The results might therefore be 
applicable to similar populations where physicians are 
able to refer patients to an eff
 ective weight management 
programme provided at no cost to the patient, as is the 
case in the UK, Australia, or Germany. In health-care 
systems in which free treatment is not available, 
arranging a referral at the patient’s own cost might 
possibly also be eff
 ective, although not everyone will be 
able to aff
 ord the weekly fee (about £5 in the UK).
 In most consultations, physicians do not discuss weight 
with patients who are obese.4,28 In the control group, 
physicians provided strong advice that losing weight would 
benefi
 t participants’ health and it is possible that this 
advice alone might have been eff
 ective. Results from a 
meta-analysis of general population cohorts suggests that 
people who are obese lose 300 g a year in the course of 
normal living.25 On average, individuals in who only 
received this advice lost more than 1 kg, which is typical of 
a population motivated to lose weight.29 Other data from 
our trial also suggest that physician’s advice motivated 
patients and prompted action. In the population screened, 
more people had attended a weight management group 
in the 3 months after the intervention than in the 
3 months before the GP’s advice.
Most people who were obese in this unselected 
population took action during the year to lose weight. 
Although the active brief intervention increased the 
proportion of people taking some action from 75% of 
to 86% (table 3), it increased the proportion of people 
who were taking eff
 ective action by fi
 ve times. This fi
 ve 
times increase in the use of a routinely available 
behavioural weight management programme created 
the diff
 erence in weight loss between treatment groups, 
with individuals who attended a weight loss programme 
lost substantially more weight than those who did not 
attend one. These programmes are widely available for 
primary care and some secondary care physicians to 
refer patients to in the English NHS. However, available 
data suggest that such referrals are rare.30 The implication 
for practising physicians is that they should concentrate 
on directing patients to eff
 ective support rather than 
seeking to boost inherent motivation to take any action 
at all. For behavioural scientists who are developing 
future brief interventions, it is notable that this 
intervention seems to have increased motivation to act 
by providing an opportunity to do so, rather than just 
reasons to act. Also notable is the fact that weight loss in 
this initially unmotivated group who attended the weight 
loss programme was similar to that seen in people 
seeking help to lose weight.19,20 Intrinsic motivation 
might not be key to success in well-structured 
behavioural weight loss programmes.
Guidelines recommend that physicians off
 er brief 
opportunistic interventions to patients who are obese, and, 
to our knowledge, this trial is the fi
 rst to directly support 
these recommendations.1,2 The recommendations are 
based on evidence from trials that behavioural weight 
management programmes are eff
 ective.19–21 However, these 
trials have involved people actively seeking help from a 
physician to lose weight. No previous trial has approached 
people opportunistically at visits in which patients were 
consulting about problems unrelated to their weight and 
off
 ered treatment, as physicians did here (panel).
Initially, physicians participating in this trial reported 
that they were nervous about off
 ering unprompted 
interventions on weight and that they had often become 
embroiled in long and fruitless conversations on weight 
in the past. The results from this trial should provide 
strong reassurance and a practical way forward. 
Additionally, the costs of this intervention were modest. 
GPs reported that patients returned for follow-up rarely 
or never, so the intervention takes 30 s of the physician’s 
time, costing roughly £1·45, and the 12 week behavioural 
support programme that the physicians referred 
patients to cost £50. In this trial, research assistants 
booked 
patients 
into 
the 
weight 
management 
programme. This task—ie, opening the website of the 
provider and fi
 nding a convenient day and time and 
transferring the details to a voucher—could easily be 
completed by the physician’s administrative staff
 , such 
as receptionists. This would cost about £0·76 for the 
2 min it takes to complete. Given that 40% of patients in 
the active intervention group attended the programme, 
each brief intervention cost the NHS about £22, giving a 
cost per kg lost at 12 months of £16. This cost per kg is 
many times less than that of other available interventions 
for obesity, such as prescription of pharmacotherapy. 
Although prescription could add to the eff
 ectiveness of 
brief interventions, this low cost per kg makes the case 
that brief interventions could reasonably be viewed as 
the fi
 rst option in physicians’ time and eff
 ort spent on 
obesity. A fuller cost-eff
 ectiveness analysis will be 
published elsewhere. In the UK and USA, more than 
80% of patients attend their primary care physician 
every year, making fi
 ve and three visits per year, 
respectively.31–34 In a post-hoc analysis, we used an 
established microsimulation model to examine the 
cumulative health eff
 ect of physicians making a brief 
intervention on just one of these visits each year.35 
According to our simulation, by 2035,  because of the 
falling prevalence of obesity, the annual incidence of 
coronary heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes 
could be 22%, 23%, and 17% lower than predicted in the 
base case model in the UK and 9%, 21%, and 20% lower 
in the USA. This frequency of brief interventions would 
take a primary care physician about 2·5 h per year in the 
UK and 4 h per year in the USA to deliver, but would 
probably save much more time in reduced consultations 
for these chronic conditions.
In conclusion, a brief opportunistic intervention by 
physicians to motivate weight loss in unselected patients 
who are obese was highly acceptable to patients. When 
combined with supportive systems, the intervention led 
to overall population weight loss.
