SUMMARY
The human gut is colonized by a large number of mi-
croorganisms (�1013 bacteria) that support various
physiologic functions. A perturbation in the healthy
gut microbiome might lead to the development of
inflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis
(MS). Therefore, gut commensals might provide
promising therapeutic options for treating MS and
other diseases. We report the identification of human
gut-derived commensal bacteria, Prevotella histi-
cola, which can suppress experimental autoim-
mune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in a human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) class II transgenic mouse model.
P. histicola suppresses disease through the modula-
tion of systemic immune responses. P. histicola chal-
lenge led to a decrease in pro-inflammatory Th1 and
Th17 cells and an increase in the frequencies of
CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells, tolerogenic dendritic
cells, and suppressive macrophages. Our study pro-
vides evidence that the administration of gut com-
mensals may regulate a systemic immune response
and may, therefore, have a possible role in treatment
strategies for MS.
INTRODUCTION
The human gut is colonized by a large number of microorgan-
isms (�1013 bacteria) that support various physiologic functions
(Sender et al., 2016). Recent research envisages humans as
holobionts having evolved with our microbiome, with the latter
playing an important role in maintaining human health (Charbon-
neau et al., 2016; Honda and Littman, 2016). The increased prev-
alence of inflammatory diseases in developed countries has
been attributed to an altered gut microbiome that is characteris-
tically linked with the disease state. Therefore, gut commensals
capable of restoring the healthy microbiome could be a prom-
ising therapy for treating inflammatory diseases such as multiple
sclerosis (MS). Although several therapies for MS are available,
none cure the disease, and many are not well tolerated.
The hypothesis that MS is an autoimmune disease caused by
myelin-specific CD4 T cells comes from experimental autoim-
mune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS (Gold
et al., 2000). The CD4 T cell repertoire is selected in humans
by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules, and MS
patients show increased frequency of particular HLA class II
haplotypes, such as HLA-DR2/DQ6, DR3/DQ2, and DR4/DQ8
(Dyment et al., 2005; Zivadinov et al., 2007). We have used trans-
genic mice expressing human class II genes and lacking endog-
enous class II genes to identify disease-susceptible and
disease-resistant class II alleles (Luckey et al., 2011; Mangalam
et al., 2008). Transgenic mice expressing HLA-DR3 and DQ8
genes (HLA-DR3.DQ8) develop EAE and have severe brain and
spinal cord pathology (Mangalam et al., 2009; Mangalam et al.,
2004).
During recent decades, the incidence of autoimmune diseases
in developed countries has increased steadily (Bach, 2002;
Okada et al., 2010). Numerous hypotheses have been suggested
to explain this phenomenon, including alterations of the gut
microbiome due to decreased exposure to parasites, antibiotics,
western diet, and other environmental factors (Rook, 2012).
Additionally, western diets are associated with an abundance
of the Bacteroides enterotype, whereas the Prevotella entero-
type is more prevalent in persons with a carbohydrate-rich,
high-fiber, agrarian diet (Wu et al., 2011).
As certain commensal bacteria residing in the intestine might
have immunomodulatory properties, we cultured proximal small
bowel biopsies from celiac disease patients to isolate and char-
acterize gut commensals with the ability to modulate immune
response (Marietta et al., 2016). We isolated strains of Prevotella
histicola, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Capnocytophaga spu-
tigena and then investigated the ability of these anaerobic,

 Gram-negative Bacteroidetes commensals to modulate proteo-
lipid protein (PLP)91–110-induced EAE in HLA-DR3.DQ8 trans-
genic mice. Here, we report that a strain of P. histicola can
suppress or prevent disease in EAE. We further show that
P. histicola suppresses disease through downregulation of pro-
inflammatory Th1/Th17 response and induction of regulatory
CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs).
RESULTS
Treatment with P. histicola Suppressed PLP91–110-
Induced EAE in HLA-DR3.DQ8 Transgenic Mice
Previously, we showed that double-transgenic mice expressing
HLA-DR3.DQ8 develop EAE with CNS pathology (Mangalam
et al., 2009). Therefore, we tested the immunomodulatory
capabilities of P. histicola, P. melaninogenica, and C. sputigena
in HLA-DR3.DQ8 transgenic mice (see Figure S1A). Among the
groups tested with the three bacteria strains, the P. histicola-
treated group had higher levels of interleukin (IL)-10 and trans-
forming growth factor b (TGF-b), compared to medium or
C. sputigena-treated mice. Mice treated with P. melaninogenica
had higher levels of IL-10 but no change in the levels of TGF-b
or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a). Next, we tested whether
these commensals modulated EAE in HLA-DR3.DQ8 transgenic
mice.
EAE was induced in HLA-DR3.DQ8 transgenic mice (Manga-
lam et al., 2009), and 7 days post-immunization, animals were
challenged with 1 3 109 colony-forming units (CFUs) per milliliter
of bacteria or medium (Lavasani et al., 2010). Mice were gavaged
every other day with P. histicola,P. melaninogenica, C. sputigena,
Escherichia coli (control-derived from mouse intestine), or
medium alone and monitored for disease incidence and severity.
P. histicola-treated mice had a reduced incidence of disease,
with only 5 of 20 mice (25%) developing EAE, as compared
with
100%
EAE
incidence
(20/20)
in
medium-fed
mice
(p < 0.005) (Figures 1A and 1B; Table 1). Challenge with
P. melaninogenica had a mild suppressive effect, but the cumu-
lative disease score was not different from that of control groups.
In contrast, all mice in the C. sputigena-treated and E. coli-treated
groups developed disease. Because P. histicola-challenged
mice had a less cumulative disease (13.6 ± 18.9 versus 76.75 ±
7.7; p < 0.001) (Figure 1B), and not P. melaninogenica-challenged
mice, we focused on P. histicola for later experiments. Further,
disease onset was delayed in P. histicola-challenged mice
compared with medium-challenged mice (17.5 ± 0.3 days versus
10.6 ± 0.2 days; p < 0.005) (Table 1). To address whether coloni-
zation with P. histicola alone can modulate the disease, we
depleted microbial flora of mice using broad-spectrum antibi-
otics for 3 weeks (Rakoff-Nahoum et al., 2004) and gavaged
with medium or P. histicola. The P. histicola-challenged group
developed milder EAE, compared to the medium-treated group
(see Figure S1B). These data suggest that P. histicola alone can
modulate EAE in HLA-DR3.DQ8 mice.
P. histicola challenge did not cause any pathology in the upper
gut (see Figure S1C). To investigate which part of the gut
P. histicola colonizes, naive mice (8–12 weeks old) were treated
with either medium or P. histicola. Utilizing qPCR and Prevotella-
specific primers, we observed higher colonization in the stomach
and jejunum/ileum (see Figure S1D). Thus, our data suggest that
P. histicola might colonize the upper gut of HLA-DR3.DQ8 trans-
genic mice.
Disease-Suppressive Effects of P. histicola Required
Viable Bacteria
To determine whether P. histicola suppression of disease
required whole bacteria or bacteria-derived soluble factors,
we investigated the ability of cell-free P. histicola culture super-
natant (PH-CS) to suppress EAE. The PH-CS-treated group had
a disease incidence of 67% (10/15), compared with a 27%
incidence rate in the P. histicola-challenged group (see Table
S1). Mice challenged with PH-CS had a greater risk of devel-
oping EAE than mice given live P. histicola (hazard ratio, 3.3;
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03–10.5; p = 0.04), indicating
that PH-CS had a modest effect on disease incidence (Fig-
ure S2). The risk of EAE development was significantly lower
in the live-bacterium group (hazard ratio, 7.7; 95% CI, 2.5–24;
p = 0.005). We tested live P. histicola in doses that ranged
from 1 3 107 to 1 3 109 CFUs/mL and observed a dose-depen-
dent effect with optimal suppression at 1 3 108 CFUs/mL (see
Table S2).
Treatment with P. histicola Reduced Inflammation and
Demyelination in the CNS
Analysis
of
CNS
tissues
from
medium-challenged
HLA-
DR3.DQ8 transgenic mice showed severe inflammation and
demyelination in the brain and spinal cord compared to the
P. histicola-challenged groups (Figure 1C). Quantitative analysis
of spinal cord inflammation and demyelination showed that
P. histicola-challenged animals had fewer regions with inflam-
mation and demyelination (Figure 1D). Groups receiving other
bacteria (E. coli and C. sputigena) had severe CNS inflammation
and demyelination, similar to the medium-challenged group.
Thus, treatment with P. histicola reduced CNS inflammation
and demyelination, compared to the medium-only group.
P. histicola Administration Downregulated PLP91�110-
Specific T Cell and Cytokine Response
To determine the effect of P. histicola on antigen-specific T cell
responses, we isolated splenocytes from mice given bacteria
or
medium
and
stimulated
with
the
PLP91–110
peptide.
P. histicola-challenged mice had less antigen-specific T cell
response compared with the medium-challenged group or the
E.
coli-challenged
group
(Figure
2A).
Splenocytes
from
P. histicola-challenged mice produced less proinflammatory
cytokines IL-17 and interferon (IFN)-g after stimulation with
PLP91–110, whereas the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was
increased (Figure 2B). Levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a
were similar among different groups (Figure 2B). Animals given
control bacteria (E. coli) showed cytokine levels similar to that
of the medium-only group.
P. histicola Treatment Reduced the Blood-Brain Barrier
(BBB) and Gut Permeability and Downregulated CNS
Inflammation
The P. histicola-challenged group had reduced BBB perme-
ability, as measured by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-
1270

 albumin, compared with the medium-only group (Figure 2C).
Mice with EAE also had increased gut permeability, compared
to
the
medium-treated
group.
However,
challenge
with
P. histicola restored the gut permeability to pre-EAE levels (Fig-
ure 2D). Groups receiving E. coli had increased permeability of
both BBB and gut, which was similar to that of the medium-
treated group (Figures 2C and 2D). CNS tissue from the
P. histicola-treated
mice had reduced cellular infiltration,
compared with the control groups (Figure 2E), with lower levels
of total CD4 T cells as well as IFN-g- and IL-17-expressing
CD4 T cells, compared with the medium- or E. coli-treated
groups (Figures 2F–2H). Thus, P. histicola decreased BBB
permeability and reduced the frequency of pro-inflammatory
Th1 and Th17 cells in the CNS.
P. histicola Suppresses EAE through an Increase in
CD4+FoxP3+Tregs
To identify the cell population(s) responsible for the disease-pro-
tective effect, we characterized the cellular profile of bacterially
challenged and untreated animals. Prevotella-challenged mice
had an increased frequency of CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs in the spleen
and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) (Figures 3A and 3B). To test
whether P. histicola could directly induce a Treg population,
naive HLA-DR3.DQ8 transgenic mice were challenged with
1 3 108 CFUs/mL P. histicola or medium on alternate days for
seven doses. P. histicola-treated animals had higher levels of
CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs in splenocytes, MLNs, and cervical
lymph nodes (CLNs), compared with the medium-treated
group
(see
Figure
S3).

Animals were immunized with PLP91–110 peptide and treated with either bacteria or medium starting at day 7 post-immunization and every other day, for a total of
seven doses.
(A) Only P. histicola-treated mice had late disease onset and lower disease incidence. No significant effect was observed in the groups receiving
P. melaninogenica, C. sputigena, or E. coli. Animals were scored daily for disease, and the daily mean disease score for each group is plotted. Error bars represent
SEM.
(B) P. histicola-treated animals had a lower average cumulative disease score compared with medium-treated animals. Error bars represent SD.
(C) Mice were sacrificed on day 30 post-immunization, and the brain and spinal cord were examined by histopathology. Representative photomicrographs show
mild to severe inflammation and demyelination in medium-treated mice compared with P. histicola-treated mice.
(D) Quantitative analysis of spinal cord pathology similarly showed increased inflammation and demyelination in medium-treated groups compared with the
P. histicola-treated group. Error bars represent SD.
The data in (A) and (B) represent average cumulative scores of three experiments performed at different times with n = 10 mice per group. The data in (C) and (D)

 P. histicola-challenged animals also showed higher suppression
of PLP91–110-specific CD4+ T effector cells compared with the
Tregs isolated from naive, medium-treated, or E. coli-treated
mice (Figure 3C). Therefore, P. histicola increased regulatory
CD4+ T cell numbers and also enhanced their suppressive
function.
P. histicola Challenge Increased the Frequency and
Activity of Tolerogenic Dendritic Cells (DCs)
Next, we analyzed levels of CD103+CD11c+ tolerogenic DCs
in MLNs, and in splenocytes, among different treatment
groups. P. histicola-treated animals had increased levels of
CD103+CD11c+ DCs in the spleen and MLNs, compared with
the medium-treated group (Figure 3D). CD11c+ cells from
P. histicola-treated animals had lower antigen presentation
capacity, compared with CD11c+ DCs isolated from naive,
medium-treated, or E. coli-treated mice (Figure 3E). Lipopoly-
saccharide-stimulated CD11c+ DCs from medium-treated mice
produced high levels of IL-23 and low levels of IL-10, whereas
P. histicola-treated animals produced low levels of IL-23 and
high levels of IL-10 (Figure 3F). CD11c+ DCs isolated from the
E. coli-treated group behaved similarly to the medium-treated
group (Figure 3F). We also observed that P. histicola challenge
led to the induction of CD11b+Gr-1med macrophages (Fig-
ure S4A) and that CD11b+ cells from the P. histicola-challenged
group had reduced antigen presentation capacity, compared to
the medium-treated group (Figure S4B). Macrophages from
P. histicola-treated animals produced higher IL-10 and lower
IL-12 (Figure S4C), compared with medium-treated or E. coli-
treated groups. Thus, P. histicola-treated animals had an
increased frequency of tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells
and decreased antigen presentation capacity compared with
medium-treated animals.
Splenocytes from P. histicola-Treated Animals
Suppressed PLP91–110-Induced EAE
Next, we tested whether adoptive transfer of immune cells from
P. histicola-treated mice would ameliorate EAE. We transferred
splenocytes (1 3 107) from PLP91–110 EAE-immunized animals
treated with either P. histicola or medium into different mice
that had been previously immunized with PLP91–110 5 days earlier
(Mangalam et al., 2012). The group receiving splenocytes from
P. histicola-treated animals had lower disease incidence and
severity, as compared with the untreated mice or those receiving
splenocytes from medium-treated animals (Figure S5). Thus, our
data indicated that the disease-suppressive effect of P. histicola
was transferable.
P. histicola Challenge Caused a Shift in the Composition
of the Gut Microbiota
Finally, to investigate whether treatment with P. histicola can
alter gut microbiota composition, fecal samples were collected
from pre- (naive) and post-immunized (EAE) mice receiving either
medium or P. histicola. Mice with EAE had a distinct fecal micro-
biota, compared to naive mice (Figure 4A); however, challenge
with P. histicola shifted gut microbiota composition closer to
that of pre-immunized (naive) mice. Naive mice had a higher rela-
tive abundance of certain genera such as Prevotella, Lactoba-
cillus, and Sutterella, which were reduced in the EAE group
receiving medium. However, mice induced for EAE and treated
with P. histicola had increased abundance of Prevotella, Lacto-
bacillus, and Sutterella (Figures 4B and 4C). Thus, P. histicola
challenge restored gut microbiota to the pre-immunized state.
DISCUSSION
We have identified a commensal bacterium, P. histicola, from the
human upper gastrointestinal tract that had a systemic suppres-
sive effect distant from the small intestine. P. histicola inhibited
the development of EAE in HLA-DR3.DQ8 transgenic mice, a
preclinical model of MS. We observed that P. histicola treatment
markedly
attenuated
inflammation
and demyelination
and
reduced BBB permeability, compared to medium or control
bacteria. We demonstrated that P. histicola suppressed disease
by downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNg and IL-
17, by inducing CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs, tolerogenic DCs,
and suppressive macrophages. These observations suggest
that P. histicola monotherapy is effective when administered to
HLA transgenic mice, a model of the chronic disease. Disease
protection induced by P. histicola was transferable into other an-
imals; this, therefore, supports our hypothesis that P. histicola
protects the mice from EAE by modulating the systemic immune
response. Our study shows that a human commensal from the
upper gastrointestinal tract possesses potent disease-protec-
tive characteristics and provides proof of principle that human
commensal gut bacteria protect against neuroinflammation.
Recent studies have indicated that the ecosystem that is
composed of human commensal bacteria (i.e., the microbiome)
is a new frontier of biologic discovery with great therapeutic po-
tential. Examples of bacterial therapeutics for ameliorating EAE
include Bacteroides fragilis (Round and Mazmanian, 2010;
Surana and Kasper, 2012) and mixtures of Lactobacillus strains
(Lavasani et al., 2010). The disease-protective effects of
B. fragilis have been attributed to its production of polysaccha-
ride A (PSA) (Ochoa-Repa
´ raz et al., 2010). However, live

 P. histicola was needed for maximal disease protection in our
study, which suggests that the interaction of the living bacteria
with the gut mucosal immune systems may be required. The abil-
ity of P. histicola to suppress EAE in mice with depleted gut flora
suggests a direct role for P. histicola in disease suppression.
However, we cannot rule out potential additional indirect effects
through modulation of other microbes, because P. histicola
treatment was also associated with a shift in gut microbiota to
more closely resemble that of a healthy mouse, with an increase
in the relative abundance of Prevotella, Sutterella, and Lactoba-
cillus at the genus level. Although both Prevotella and Sutterella
genera had been shown to be increased in relapsing-remitting
MS (RRMS) patients on disease-modifying treatments (Jangi
et al., 2016), it is currently unclear whether the species of Prevo-
tella (i.e., P. histicola) used in our study is part of the observed
alteration of Prevotella at the genus levels in patients with MS.
A previous study has shown that B. fragilis, a gut commensal,
can influence host behavior by modulation of gut microbes
(Hsiao et al., 2013). Thus, it is possible that P. histicola-induced
changes in gut microbiome might also contribute to P. histicola’s
disease-protective effect either directly, indirectly, or both.
P. histicola challenge was associated with elevated levels of
IL-10, CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs, tolerogenic DCs, and suppressive
macrophages. The disease-protective effect of other human
commensals such as B. fragilis and a mixture of Lactobacillus
species in EAE has been attributed to their ability to induce
CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs and IL-10 (Lavasani et al., 2010; Ochoa-Rep-
a
´ raz et al., 2010). A role of tolerogenic DCs observed in our study
Figure 2. P. histicola-Treated Mice Show Decreased T Cell Recall Response, CNS Inflammation, and Cytokine Levels
(A) P. histicola-treated animals had a reduced T cell proliferative response to the PLP91–110 peptide in vitro, compared with the medium- and E. coli-treated
groups. Response to concanavalin A was similar among three groups. The data presented are the mean counts per minute ± SD.
(B) Splenocytes stimulated with antigen from P. histicola-treated mice had reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IFN-g and increased levels of anti-
inflammatory cytokine IL-10, compared with medium-treated mice. The data presented are the average of two independent experiments (n = 4 mice per group).
(C and D) Medium-treated HLA-DR3.DQ8 transgenic mice had compromised BBB permeability (C) and gut permeability (D). Challenge with P. histicola restored
BBB permeability (C) as well gut permeability to pre-EAE levels.
(E) Cellular infiltration into the CNS was reduced in P. histicola-treated mice, compared with medium- or E. coli-treated mice.
(F–H) CNS inflammatory cells from the P. histicola-treated group had reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IFN-g as measured by ELISA (F) and flow
cytometry (G and H, respectively), compared with the medium-treated group.
Error bars represent SD. The data represent two separate experiments performed in triplicate (n = 5 mice per group). *p % 0.05; ** p % 0.005; n.s., not significant,

 is consistent with earlier studies (Ochoa-Repa
´ raz et al., 2010)
showing a role for CD11c+ DCs in suppressing disease in a
PSA-treated EAE model. P. histicola increased levels of tolero-
genic CD103+ DCs, producing high levels of IL-10 and low levels
of IL-23.
Both IL-17 and IFN-y are the major pro-inflammatory cyto-
kines associated with the pathology of MS. P. histicola treatment
suppressed myelin antigen-specific T cell recall response and
reduced IL-17 and IFN-g in the periphery, as well as in CNS.
Thus, P. histicola might mediate its effect through the downregu-
lation of pro-inflammatory cells of both Th1 and Th17 pheno-
types. Once inflammatory cells are activated in the periphery,
their movement across the BBB and into the CNS is an essential
step for initiating inflammation and demyelination in the brain
and spinal cord. Reduced BBB permeability and milder pathol-
ogy in the brain and spinal cord from P. histicola-treated
mice suggests that P. histicola mediates its suppressive effect
through modulation of inflammatory cells trafficking to the CNS.
Our study demonstrates that P. histicola can suppress EAE in
mice; however, it is currently unclear whether P. histicola supple-
mentation will be effective as a treatment for MS. Interestingly,
the genus Prevotella is reduced in RRMS patients, compared
with healthy controls (Chen et al., 2016; Miyake et al., 2015),
and increased in RRMS patients on disease-modifying treat-
ments (Jangi et al., 2016). Thus, human MS studies suggest
that individual, or a combination of, Prevotella strains might
have immunomodulatory properties; however, it is unknown
whether these changes at the genus level correlate with changes
in P. histicola or some other species of Prevotella.
In summary, we report the association of a human commensal
bacterium with disease-protective abilities in an animal model of
MS. Our data indicate that P. histicola, a human commensal, has
immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory capabilities that sup-
press PLP91–110-induced EAE in HLA-DR3.DQ8 transgenic mice.
The disease protection was due to the ability of P. histicola to
induce regulatory and suppressive immune subsets. Our future
studies will investigate whether P. histicola modulates human
immune cells directly or via its interaction with intestinal epithelial
cells. This work demonstrates that P. histicola can manipulate
the systemic immunity and organ-specific disease far away
from its localization in the gut.

Figure 3. P. histicola Challenge Increased the Frequency and Activity of CD4+FoxP3+ Regulatory T Cells and Tolerogenic DCs
(A) P. histicola-treated mice had an increased frequency of CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs, compared with the medium-treated group or E. coli-treated group. Numbers in
scatterplots indicate the percentage of positive cells.
(B) Histogram plot of Treg frequency in the P. histicola-treated and untreated groups. The data presented are the average of two independent experiments (n = 4
mice per group).
(C) CD4+CD25+ Tregs from P. histicola-treated mice had increased suppressive activity, compared with the medium-treated group or the E. coli-treated group.
(D) The P. histicola-treated group had increased levels of CD103+CD11c+ DCs in the spleen and MLNs, compared with the medium-treated group. Numbers in the
histogram indicate the percentage of CD103+ cells gated from the CD11c+ population. Data are from one of three experiments performed at different times.
(E) Co-culture of CD11c+ cells from the P. histicola-treated group with PLP-specific CD4 T cells resulted in reduced proliferation, compared to the medium-
treated group or the naive group. The data are presented as the mean counts per minute (CPM) ± SD and are the average of two independent experiments (n = 3
mice per group).
(F) CD11c+ DCs from the P. histicola-treated group produced low IL-23 and high IL-10, compared with the medium-treated group. The data are presented as the
mean CPM ± SD and are the average of two independent experiments (n = 3 mice per group).
(B–F) Error bars represent SD.

 Isolation and Culture of Bacteria
Prevotella and similar anaerobic Gram-negative Bacteroidetes bacteria were
isolated from the duodenum of treated celiac disease patients, and their identity
was confirmed using 16SrRNA-specific PCRfollowed by sequencing, as well as
whole-genome sequencing, as described previously (Marietta et al., 2016).
Flow Cytometry
Expression of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ molecules on peripheral blood leuko-
cytes, lymph node cells, and splenocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry.
Additional details are provided in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Disease Induction and Scoring
For disease induction, 8- to 12-week-old transgenic mice were immunized
subcutaneously in both flanks with 100 mg of PLP91–110. Disease severity
was scored as described previously (Mangalam et al., 2009); additional details
are provided in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Treatment of Animals with Commensal Bacteria
HLA-DR3.DQ8
transgenic
mice
were
treated
with
P.
histicola,
P. melaninogenica, C. sputigena, and mouse-specific E. coli or media by
oral gavage, starting 7 days after immunization. Animals were gavage-fed on
alternate days with 1 3 108 CFUs in 100 mL of culture medium or medium
alone, for a total of seven doses. Mice were evaluated for disease incidence,
duration, and severity for 4 weeks after immunization.
T Cell Proliferation and Cytokine Assay
Tcellrecallresponsewas measuredinsplenocytesandlymphnodesfromimmu-
nized mice using standard thymidine incorporation methods (Das et al., 2000).
Gut Flora Depletion and Colonization with Prevotella
Gut flora was depleted by giving a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail (0.5 g/L
vancomycin, 1 g/L neomycin sulfate, 1 g/L metronidazole, 1 g/L ampicillin) in
drinking water as described previously (Rakoff-Nahoum et al., 2004). After
3 weeks of antibiotic treatment, animals were placed on sterile water for
3 days before being challenged with P. histicola (108 CFUs) or medium on alter-
nate days, for the total of seven doses. One week after the last dose, EAE was
induced, and the disease was monitored (Mangalam et al., 2009).
Isolation of Tregs, DCs, and Macrophages
Tregs, DCs, and macrophages were isolated from splenocytes using commer-
cial cell isolation kits (Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego, CA). Additional details are
provided in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Figure 4. P. histicola Challenge Caused a Shift in the Composition of the Gut Microbiota
(A) HLA-DR3.DQ8 transgenic mice with EAE had a distinct gut microbiome profile compared to those from pre-immunized (naive mice). The P. histicola-treated
group had a gut microbiota profile similar to that of the pre-immunized (naive mice) group. Weighted UniFrac-based 3D PCoA plot based on all OTUs from fecal
samples of mice from the pre-immunized (n = 6), medium-treated EAE group (n = 11), and the P. histicola–treated group (n = 6).
(B) Relative abundance of gut microbiota at the genus levels in pre-immunized (naive mice), EAE mice treated with medium, and EAE mice treated with P. histicola.
(C) Boxplot showing a normalized relative abundance of bacteria (genus-level profile) between groups. Mice with EAE had loss of certain genera, especially
Prevotella, Sutterella, and Lactobacillus, compared to pre-immunized (naive) mice. P. histicola challenge restored the abundance of Prevotella, Sutterella, and
Lactobacillus. The difference between groups was analyzed using one-way ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test) and false-discovery-rate-adjusted p < 0.05.
The colored box represents middle 50% of the distribution with top and bottom horizontal lines representing maximum and minimum abundance levels of
particular bacteria.

 In Vitro Functional Analysis of Tregs, DCs, and Macrophages
Suppressive abilities of CD4+CD25+ Tregs isolated from P. histicola-treated or
medium-treated HLA-DR3.DQ8 transgenic mice were analyzed by coculturing
Tregs (5 3 104 cells per well) with PLP91–110-specific CD4+ T cells (5 3 104 cells
per well) in the presence of irradiated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) loaded
with antigen. Additional details are provided in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures. Lipopolysaccharides from E. coli 026:B6 (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) were used to stimulate macrophages and DCs.
Adoptive Transfer of Splenocytes
The splenocytes were collected from EAE-immunized animals treated with
either P. histicola or medium and transferred (1 3 107 cells per mouse) intrave-
nously into PLP91–110-immunized HLA-DR3.DQ8 transgenic mice 5 days after
immunization. The timing for adoptive transfer studies was based on our pre-
vious study (Mangalam et al., 2012).
Microbiome Analysis
Fecal pellets were collected from pre- and post-immunized mice. Microbial
DNA extraction, 16S amplicon preparation (V3–V5 region), and sequencing
were done as described previously (Chen et al., 2016). R1.fastq and R2.fastq
reads were merged using Paired-End reAd mergeR (PEAR) (Zhang et al.,
2014), merged reads were converted to FASTA, and merged FASTA se-
quences were processed by Cloud Virtual Resource (CloVR) (Angiuoli et al.,
2011) to form operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% similarity; and histo-
grams were generated using METAGENassist (Arndt et al., 2012).
Pathology
Brain and spinalcordsections were analyzedfor inflammation and demyelination
afterstainingwithmodifiedH&E,asdescribedpreviously(Mangalametal.,2009).
Additional details are provided in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Statistical Analysis
Differences in proliferation or cytokine levels between groups was assessed by
a one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons of the means when more than
two groups were analyzed or by Student’s t test when only two groups were
analyzed if their data were normally distributed. The Kaplan-Meier method
was used to estimate the probability of survival. The log-rank test was used
to compare outcomes of different treatment groups. Hazard ratios (HRs) for
developing disease (and 95% CIs) were calculated from the estimated coeffi-
cients in Cox proportional hazards regression models. All statistical analyses
were performed with GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) or
SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A significance level of 0.05 was used.
