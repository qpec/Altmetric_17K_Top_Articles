 Diagnosis of Acute Gout: A Clinical Practice Guideline From the
American College of Physicians
Amir Qaseem, MD, PhD, MHA; Robert M. McLean, MD; Melissa Starkey, PhD; and Mary Ann Forciea, MD; for the Clinical
Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians*
Description: The American College of Physicians (ACP) devel-
oped this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical
recommendations on the diagnosis of gout.
Methods: This guideline is based on a systematic review of pub-
lished studies on gout diagnosis, identified using several data-
bases, from database inception to February 2016. Evaluated out-
comes included the accuracy of the test results; intermediate
outcomes (results of laboratory and radiographic tests, such as
serum urate and synovial fluid crystal analysis and radiographic
or ultrasonography changes); clinical decision making (addi-
tional testing and pharmacologic or dietary management); short-
term clinical (patient-centered) outcomes, such as pain and joint
swelling and tenderness; and adverse effects of the tests. This
guideline grades the evidence and recommendations by using
the ACP grading system, which is based on the GRADE (Grading
of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evalua-
tion) method.
Target Audience and Patient Population: The target audi-
ence for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target pa-
tient population includes adults with joint inflammation sus-
pected to be gout.
Recommendation: ACP recommends that clinicians use syno-
vial fluid analysis when clinical judgment indicates that diagnostic
testing is necessary in patients with possible acute gout. (Grade:
weak recommendation, low-quality evidence)

G
out is caused by excess urate crystals accumulating
in body tissues and fluid, resulting in inflammatory
arthritis. Patients have joint swelling and pain during
gout attacks, the initial stages of which are called acute
gouty arthritis or acute gout flares. Progression to
chronic gout may be accompanied by the accumula-
tion of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals (known as to-
phi) in joints, cartilage, tendons, bursae, bone, and soft
tissue. Risk factors associated with gout include male
sex, overweight or obesity, hypertension, excess alco-
hol intake, diuretic use, a diet rich in meat and seafood,
and poor kidney function (1–4). The self-reported prev-
alence of ever receiving a gout diagnosis is estimated
to be 3.9% in U.S. adults older than age 20 (5); this
prevalence increased by 1.0% between about 1990
and 2007 (5). An estimated $1 billion is spent annually
on ambulatory care for gout, largely on treatments and
prescription medications (6).
Correctly diagnosing gout and differentiating it
from other inflammatory arthritic conditions, such as
rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis, and inflammatory
episodes of osteoarthritis, is important, because treat-
ment of these conditions differ. The reference standard
for diagnosing acute gout is joint aspiration with syno-
vial fluid analysis for MSU. However, most patients ini-
tially are seen in the primary care or emergency medi-
cine setting, where synovial fluid analysis rarely is
performed. Synovial fluid analysis is also underutilized
in rheumatology (7). Additional approaches for diag-
nosing acute gout include clinical algorithms that incor-
porate patient signs and symptoms, ultrasonography,
dual-energy computed tomography (DECT), computed
tomography, and plain radiography.
GUIDELINE FOCUS AND TARGET POPULATION
The purpose of this American College of Physicians
(ACP) guideline is to provide guidance on diagnosing
acute gout in patients with gout symptoms, including
joint inflammation. This guideline does not apply to
adults who have chronic gout that was diagnosed pre-
viously by identification of MSU and who present with a
flare and no suggestion of a concurrent problem, such
as a septic joint. These recommendations are based on
a background evidence review paper (8) and an evi-
dence review sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality (AHRQ) (9).

 METHODS
Systematic Review of the Evidence
The
evidence
review
was
conducted
by
the
AHRQ's Southern California Evidence-based Practice
Center–RAND Corporation. Additional methodological
details may be found in the Appendix (available at www
.annals.org) as well as in the accompanying article (8)
and full report (9). Reviewers searched several data-
bases for studies published from database inception
through February 2016 and included prospective and
cross-sectional studies. The study population included
all adults aged 18 years or older with suspected gout
(such as an acute episode of joint inflammation).
The systematic review evaluated diagnostic tests
for gout. Evaluated outcomes included accuracy of
the test results (sensitivity, specificity, and positive and
negative predictive value); intermediate outcomes (re-
sults of laboratory and radiographic tests, such as se-
rum urate and synovial fluid crystal analysis and radio-
graphic or ultrasonography changes); clinical decision
making (additional testing and pharmacologic or di-
etary
management);
short-term
clinical
(patient-
centered) outcomes, such as pain and joint swelling
and tenderness; and adverse effects of the tests.
Grading the Evidence and Developing
Recommendations
This guideline was developed by the ACP Clinical
Guidelines Committee (CGC) according to the ACP
guideline development process, details of which may
be found in the methods paper (10). The CGC used the
evidence tables in the accompanying systematic review
(8) and full report (9) when reporting the evidence and
graded the recommendations by using the ACP sys-
tem, which is based on the GRADE (Grading of Recom-
mendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation)
method (Table).
Peer Review
The AHRQ evidence review was sent to invited
peer reviewers and posted on the AHRQ Web site for
public comments. The guideline was peer reviewed
through the journal and posted online for comments
from ACP Regents and Governors, who represent ACP
members at the regional level.
ACCURACY OF TESTS, ALGORITHMS, AND
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS
Clinical Algorithms Incorporating Clinical Signs
and Symptoms
Eleven studies assessed the sensitivity and specific-
ity of clinical algorithms versus evaluation of synovial
fluid MSU crystals for diagnosing gout (11–21) and re-
ported widely varying results. Evaluated algorithms in-
cluded the Rome criteria, New York criteria, American
Rheumatology Association criteria, Janssens diagnostic
rule, Clinical Gout Diagnosis criteria, monoarthritis of
the first metatarsophalangeal joint, SUGAR (Study
for Updated Gout Classification Criteria), and 2015
American College of Rheumatology and European
League Against Rheumatism gout classification criteria.
Moderate-quality evidence showed that several clinical
algorithms based on clinical signs and symptoms have
good specificity and sensitivity (>80%) for diagnosing
gout compared with assessment of synovial fluid MSU
crystals. Many algorithms had a higher sensitivity in pa-
tients with a longer history of flares (>2 years) than in
those with more recent-onset symptoms (≤2 years). The
components of the clinical algorithms varied; however,
most included the following clinical characteristics:
more than 1 attack of acute arthritis, maximum inflam-
mation developing within 1 day, redness observed
over joints, painful or swollen first metatarsophalangeal
joint, proven or suspected tophi, and the comorbid risk
factor of hyperuricemia. Details on each algorithm are
provided in the accompanying evidence review (8).
DECT
Low-quality evidence from 3 observational studies
(20–22) showed that DECT had a sensitivity of 85% to
100% and specificity of 83% to 92% for predicting gout
compared with assessment of synovial fluid MSU crys-
tals or clinical algorithms.
Ultrasonography
Low-quality evidence (20, 23–27) showed that
ultrasonography had a wide range in sensitivity and
specificity for diagnosing acute gout compared with as-
sessment of synovial fluid MSU crystals or clinical algo-
rithms. Pooled sensitivity from 4 trials (12, 17, 19, 28)
showed 74% sensitivity (95% CI, 52 to 88) and 88%
specificity (95% CI, 68 to 96).
DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY BASED ON JOINT SITE
AND NUMBER OF JOINTS
Insufficient evidence exists regarding whether the
joint site or number of joints involved affected the ac-
curacy of diagnostic tests based on clinical signs and
symptoms because no studies were identified that di-
rectly tested this association.
DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY BASED ON
SYMPTOM DURATION
Insufficient evidence exists regarding the effect of
symptom duration (that is, time since beginning of
flare) on the accuracy of gout diagnosis based on clin-
ical signs and symptoms.

 FACTORS AFFECTING THE ACCURACY
OF SYNOVIAL FLUID ASPIRATION AND
CRYSTAL ANALYSIS
Insufficient evidence exists to determine what fac-
tors influence the accuracy of gout diagnosis from 3
studies that reported conflicting results (29–31).
ADVERSE EFFECTS OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTS
Insufficient evidence exists regarding adverse ef-
fects associated with diagnostic tests for gout. Evidence
from 1 observational study from a referral center pro-
cedure clinic (21) reported no adverse events associ-
ated with DECT or with aspiration of synovial fluid, al-
though procedures for detecting adverse events were
not reported. One study assessed adverse events asso-
ciated with synovial fluid aspiration for MSU analysis
and reported 1 occurrence of septic arthritis and 11
nonserious adverse events, such as mild postprocedure
pain (32). None of the identified studies reported ad-
verse effects from other diagnostic tests (ultrasonogra-
phy or clinical examination). Evidence from 1 observa-
tional study from Korea (30) that assessed factors
associated with misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of
acute gout showed that misdiagnosis or delayed diag-
nosis may result in longer hospitalization and delays in
joint aspiration after a gout attack begins. Reviewers
found no evidence for patient-reported outcomes, such
as pain and subsequent infection from joint aspiration
and synovial fluid analysis, the accuracy and reliability
of synovial fluid analysis in primary care, or how often
joint aspiration is difficult or impossible in primary care.

Potential Benefits 
Accurate diagnosis of gout, leading to appropriate treatment
Potential Harms 
None reported for DECT. No studies reported for ultrasonography or clinical examination/algorithms
Synovial fluid aspiration for MSU analysis associated with nonserious adverse events, such as mild postprocedure pain
Misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, leading to inadequate or inappropriate treatment
Recommendation
Recommendation: ACP recommends that clinicians use synovial fluid analysis when clinical judgment indicates that
diagnostic testing is necessary in patients with possible acute gout. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality
evidence)
Clinical Considerations
Synovial fluid analysis is considered the reference standard for gout diagnosis, although it may be difficult to perform
in primary care.
Synovial fluid analysis should be used in the following clinical circumstances:
   The joint can be aspirated without substantial patient discomfort by an experienced clinician who can minimize the risk of 
      infection.
   A reliable and accurate source (including a polarizing microscope and a trained operator) is available to detect the presence of
      urate crystals.
   The clinical situation is ambiguous, and a probability of infection exists.
Clinical algorithms are shown to have sensitivities and specificities >80%, although little evidence exists that they can be used
to distinguish septic joints.
DECT = dual-energy computed tomography; MSU = monosodium urate.

 SUMMARY
Although synovial fluid analysis has been the refer-
ence standard for gout diagnosis, it often is difficult to
perform in primary care and even rheumatologic set-
tings. Furthermore, accurate detection of urate crystals
requires a polarizing microscope and a trained opera-
tor. Evidence for alternatives to synovial fluid MSU crys-
tal analysis for diagnosing acute gout would be helpful
but is limited. An accurate clinical algorithm that could
be used in primary care would be especially valuable.
The evidence review found moderate-quality evidence
that several clinical prediction tools have sensitivities
and specificities greater than 80% for diagnosing early-
onset gout compared with the reference standard of
synovial
fluid
MSU
crystal
analysis.
Evidence
on
whether clinical algorithms can rule out such conditions
as septic joints is limited. Evidence showing variation in
the sensitivity and specificity of both DECT and ultra-
sonography for diagnosing acute gout is also limited,
leading to uncertainty about the usefulness of these
tests in the primary care setting.
The Figure summarizes the recommendations and
clinical considerations.
RECOMMENDATION
ACP recommends that clinicians use synovial fluid
analysis when clinical judgment indicates that diagnos-
tic testing is necessary in patients with possible acute
gout.
(Grade:
weak
recommendation,
low-quality
evidence)
Synovial fluid analysis has been the reference stan-
dard for gout diagnosis. Misdiagnosis or delayed diag-
nosis of acute gout may result in unnecessary surgery;
hospitalization; delays in adequate treatment, such as
antibiotics for septic joints; and unnecessary prescrib-
ing of long-term treatment. In the absence of an
evidence-based alternative, joint aspiration and syno-
vial fluid analysis should be done if the joint can be
aspirated without substantial patient discomfort by an
experienced clinician who can minimize the risk for in-
fection; a reliable, accurate source (including a polariz-
ing microscope and a trained operator) is available to
detect the presence of urate crystals; the clinical situa-
tion is ambiguous; and a significant probability of infec-
tion exists.
If these criteria cannot be met, the clinician should
either refer the patient to a source that can meet the
criteria or use his or her clinical judgment. Clinical judg-
ment is especially appropriate in situations that are less
clinically ambiguous and where there is not a signifi-
cant probability of infection. For example, joint aspira-
tion would not be essential in a patient with podagra, a
history of appropriate risk factors (such as age), and no
sign of an overlying skin wound. This patient may ap-
propriately be considered to have gout and treated ap-
propriately (see accompanying guideline on gout
management [33]). The current evidence is insufficient
to recommend a single clinical algorithm for diagnos-
ing
gout.
However,
several
promising
algorithms
showed sensitivities and specificities greater than 80%.
Current evidence is insufficient to support the use of
DECT or ultrasonography to diagnose acute gout.
AREAS OF INCONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE
Insufficient evidence exists to determine the clinical
utility of serum urate alone, computed tomography, or
plain radiography for diagnosing gout. Evidence also is
insufficient to determine the effects of joint site, num-
ber of affected joints, duration of symptoms, or practi-
tioner type on the diagnostic accuracy of various tests.
Further validation of clinical algorithms is needed.

APPENDIX: DETAILED METHODS
The evidence review was conducted by the South-
ern California Evidence-based Practice Center–RAND
Corporation to address the following key questions:
Key Question 1
a. What is the accuracy of clinical signs and symp-
toms and other diagnostic tests (such as serum urate,
ultrasonography, computed tomography, DECT, and
plain radiography), alone or in combination, compared
with synovial fluid analysis in diagnosing acute gouty
arthritis, and how does the accuracy affect clinical deci-
sion making, clinical outcomes and complications, and
patient-centered outcomes?
b. How does the diagnostic accuracy of clinical
signs and symptoms and other tests vary by affected
joint site and number of joints?
c. Does the accuracy of diagnostic tests for gout
vary by duration of symptoms (that is, time from the
beginning of a flare)?
d. Does the accuracy of synovial fluid aspiration
and crystal analysis differ by the type of practitioner
who is performing the aspiration or the crystal analysis?
Key Question 2
a. What are the adverse effects (including pain, in-
fection at the aspiration site, radiation exposure) or
harms (related to false-positive, false-negative, and in-
determinate results) associated with tests used to diag-
nose gout?
Search Strategy
The systematic literature search included studies
identified by using PubMed (from 1946), EMBASE
(from 1972), the Cochrane Library (from 1945), and the
Web of Science (from 1949) through February 2016 as
well as unpublished or non–peer-reviewed studies
identified through ClinicalTrials.gov and the Web of
Science. Studies were not limited to those published in
English.
Quality Assessment
The QUADAS-2 (Revised Quality Assessment of Di-
agnostic Accuracy Studies) was used to assess the qual-
ity of individual studies for risk of bias (34, 35); AMSTAR
(A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews)
was used to assess the quality of existing systematic
reviews (36). This guideline rates the evidence and rec-
ommendations by using the ACP guideline grading
system, which is based on GRADE (Table 1).
Population Studied
Studies were limited to adults aged 18 years or
older with suspected gout (such as an acute episode of
joint inflammation).
Interventions Evaluated
Studies evaluated clinical history and physical ex-
amination, serum urate assessment, ultrasonography,
DECT, computed tomography, plain radiography, joint
aspiration by physicians and synovial fluid analysis us-
ing polarizing microscopy, and combinations of the
aforementioned tests as identified in the literature.
Comparators
Interventions were compared with joint synovial
fluid aspiration and microscopic assessment for MSU
crystals performed by practitioners (such as rheuma-
tologists and laboratory personnel) with different levels
of expertise or experience.
Outcomes
Outcomes evaluated included accuracy of the test
results (sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative
predictive value); intermediate outcomes (results of
laboratory and radiographic tests, such as serum urate
and synovial fluid crystal analysis and radiographic or
ultrasonography changes); clinical decision making
(additional testing and pharmacologic or dietary man-
agement); short-term clinical (patient-centered) out-
comes, such as pain and joint swelling and tenderness;
and adverse effects of the tests, including pain, infec-
tion, radiation exposure, and effects of false-positive or
-negative results.
Timing
Studies considered timing in terms of symptom re-
lief (1 to 2 days minimum), whether symptoms occurred
early versus later or after a flare, and whether adverse
outcomes occurred immediately.

 Setting
The studies were conducted in primary care (out-
patient) or acute care settings or outpatient rheumatol-
ogy practices or academic medical centers.
Target Audience
The target audience for this guideline includes all
clinicians.
Target Patient Population
The target patient population includes adults pre-
senting with symptoms suggesting acute gout (such as
an acute episode of joint inflammation), with or without
a previous gout diagnosis.
Peer Review
The AHRQ evidence review was sent to invited
peer reviewers and posted on the AHRQ Web site for
public comments. The guideline was peer reviewed
through the journal and posted online for comments
from ACP Governors and Regents. All comments were
read and carefully considered by the authors, and im-
portant issues were discussed by the CGC.
Details of the ACP guideline development process
are provided in the ACP methods paper (10).
