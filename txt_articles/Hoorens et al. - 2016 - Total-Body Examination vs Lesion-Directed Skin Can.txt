IMPORTANCE Skin cancer is the most frequent cancer type. It remains unknown if and how
screening programs can be organized in a cost-effective manner.
OBJECTIVE To compare the 2 screening strategies of systematic total-body examination
(TBE) and lesion-directed screening (LDS), with a focus on the participation rate, detection
rate, anxiety, and cost.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Population-based cross-sectional screenings by a team
of 6 dermatologists were organized in 2 sociodemographically similar regions. The TBE was
organized in a community of 9325 inhabitants 18 years and older (Wichelen, East Flanders,
Belgium) during a 5-day screening (March 14-18, 2014). The LDS was organized in a
sociodemographically comparable community (Nevele, East Flanders, Belgium) of 9484 adult
inhabitants during a 4-day screening (April 22 and 25-27, 2014). The first population received
a personal invitation for a standard TBE. In the second population, individuals were invited for
an LDS if they had a lesion meeting 1 or more of the following criteria: ABCD rule (A,
asymmetry; B, borders; C, colors; and D, differential structures), ugly duckling sign, new
lesion lasting longer than 4 weeks, or red nonhealing lesions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES In total, 1982 individuals were screened, and 47 skin
cancers (2.4%) were histologically confirmed, including 9 melanomas (0.5%), 37 basal cell
carcinomas (1.9%), and 1 squamous cell carcinoma or Bowen disease (0.1%).
RESULTS The positive predictive value for all suspicious lesions was 56.6% (47 of 83). The
participation rate was 17.9% (1668 of 9325) in the TBE group vs 3.3% (314 of 9484) in the
LDS group (P < .01). The skin cancer detection rate per 100 participants did not differ
significantly between the 2 groups, with rates of 2.3% (39 of 1668) in the TBE group vs 3.2%
(8 of 248) in the LDS group (P = .40). The operational effectiveness per 100 invitees was
0.4% (39 of 9325) in the TBE group vs 0.1% (8 of 9484) in the LDS group (P < .01). In
addition, LDS was 5.6 times less time consuming than TBE. Participants in the LDS group had
significantly higher baseline anxiety levels compared with participants in the TBE group (3.7
vs 3.3 points on a visual analog scale, P < .01). In screenees without a suspicious lesion,
anxiety levels significantly dropped after screening.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Total-body examination yielded a higher absolute number of
skin cancers. Lesion-directed screening had a similar detection rate of 3.2% (8 of 248) but
was 5.6 times less time consuming. When performed by dermatologists, LDS is an acceptable
alternative screening method in health care systems with limited budgets or long waiting lists.

T
he incidence of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin can-
cer (NMSC) has been rising dramatically worldwide, and
this increase is expected to continue with aging of the
population.1,2 The cumulative lifetime risk of developing basal
cell carcinoma (BCC) in the Netherlands is estimated to range
from 1 in 5 to 1 in 6 persons.3 In the United Kingdom, the life-
time risk of developing malignant melanoma is 1 in 55 for men
and 1 in 56 for women.4 Early detection is believed to result in
better cure rates and subsequently more cost-effective
treatment.5,6 Because skin examination is a simple, noninva-
sive technique, several early detection initiatives exist, most of
whichfocusonmelanomaonly.However,mostskincancersare
NMSC, and these neoplasms represent the greatest direct cost
to public health.7-9 Population-based screening by means of
total-bodyexamination(TBE)inasymptomaticpersonshasnot
been proven cost-effective,10,11 although experience in Ger-
many suggests that such screening is feasible and can reduce
skin cancer burden.5,12 Most screening initiatives focus on spe-
cific high-risk groups,13-15 missing many skin cancers that oc-
cur outside of this high-risk setting. A reliable and acceptable
test is an important tool in skin cancer screening. Dermoscopy
has been shown to increase diagnostic accuracy for melanoma
over naked-eye examination in experienced users.16,17
Because evidence for the cost-effectiveness of skin can-
cer screening by TBE is lacking, we aimed to test a lesion-
directed screening (LDS) approach. With this method, screen-
ees are seen with only a specific lesion of concern meeting
certain preset criteria. We hypothesized that LDS would in-
crease the a priori probability of skin cancer detection and be
time saving for the physician.
In a pilot study evaluating LDS in 199 persons, 25 suspi-
cious lesions (12.6%) were detected, and individuals were re-
ferred to their general practitioner (GP) or to a dermatologist
for further care. When only BCC (which can be diagnosed clini-
cally) and 2 histologically confirmed melanomas were in-
cluded, the pilot study had a detection rate of at least 8.5%.
This percentage is 10-fold higher than the detection rate of a
systematic skin cancer screening program in the German state
of Schleswig-Holstein, in which skin cancers were detected in
0.8% of the population, including 0.5% BCCs, 0.1% squa-
mous cell carcinomas (SCCs), and 0.2% melanomas.5 Based on
estimated incidence rates in Belgium, the expected skin can-
cer yield would be less than 0.2% of the population. There-
fore, screening individuals for selected lesions meeting pre-
defined criteria could give a higher yield of relevant lesions
than promoting systematic whole-body screening. This con-
cept is new in skin cancer screening. Based on these data, we
decided to perform a comparative effectiveness study.18
We compared dermatologist-conducted LDS with stan-
dard TBE screening in 2 sociodemographically similar re-
gions, with a focus on the participation rate, detection rate,
anxiety level, and cost. Because screening may cause anxiety
and depression,19,20 a visual analog scale (VAS) to measure
anxiety levels was included in the protocol. Such a scale is an
accepted tool used in dental practice and in the measure-
ment of perioperative anxiety.21,22 The VAS corresponds well
with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, a vali-
dated test quantifying anxiety.22
Methods
Patients and Screening
Population-based cross-sectional skin cancer screenings were
performed without randomization. The TBE was organized in
acommunityof9325inhabitants(Wichelen,EastFlanders,Bel-
gium) during a 5-day screening (March 14-18, 2014). All inhab-
itants 18 years and older received a personal invitation 5 weeks
in advance for a free-of-charge TBE, including a message that
skin cancer incidence is an increasing health care problem.
The LDS was organized in a comparable community in
terms of genetic background, socioeconomic status, culture,
and geographic area (Nevele, East Flanders, Belgium) during
a 4-day screening (April 22 and 25-27, 2014). The 9484 inhab-
itants were also invited by a personal letter 5 weeks in ad-
vance for a free-of-charge skin cancer check if they had a le-
sion meeting 1 or more of the following listed criteria: ABCD
rule (A, asymmetry; B, borders; C, colors; and D, differential
structures), ugly duckling sign, new lesion lasting longer than
4 weeks, or red nonhealing lesions. A TBE was offered to all
LDS participants at the end of the lesion screening.
Individuals were asked to preregister to obtain an esti-
mate of the number of participants and to organize the screen-
ing team. All aspects of the sensitization campaign and regis-
tration process were similar in the 2 groups. Only the specific
message to the populations differed.
The screenings were organized in a public place of the mu-
nicipality. All participants were randomized to 1 of 6 derma-
tologists (including K.V., B.B., S.D.S., K.O., or L.B.) with simi-
larexpertiseinskincanceranddermoscopy.Thescreeningwas
performed using both naked-eye inspection and dermos-
copy. In the case of a suspicious lesion, a second opinion was
obtained to reduce interobserver variability. Suspicious le-
sions were photographed, and the patient received a referral
letter for his or her GP or a dermatologist.
The study was approved by the Flemish government and
by the medical ethics committee of the University Hospital
Ghent, Ghent, Belgium. All participants provided written
informed consent.
Data Collection
Participants were interviewed using a standard question-
naire to collect information on demographics and risk fac-
tors.AnxietyaboutskincancerwasevaluatedusingaVASrang-
ing from 0 (no fear) to 10 (highest possible fear) before and
immediately after screening, irrespective of the outcome.
During the clinical examination, the following features
were recorded: skin type according to Fitzpatrick,23 solar len-
tigines, actinic keratosis, the number of nevi, and the pres-
ence of atypical nevi. All melanocytic lesions on exposed skin
(except genitalia) were counted, and atypical melanocytic nevi
were defined as previously described by Garbe et al.24,25 The
durationoftheclinicalexaminationwasnoted.Thisperiodwas
defined as the time needed for the patient to get fully un-
dressed (for TBE) or to show the specific lesion (for LDS), plus
the time needed for the dermatologist to examine the body (for
TBE) or the lesion (for LDS) via naked eye and dermoscopy.

When a suspicious lesion was detected during one of
the screenings, the patient was referred to his or her GP or
to a dermatologist for biopsy or excision and treatment. The
clinical suspicion rate was defined as the number of refer-
rals divided by the number of participants. The pathological
outcome of the lesion was retrieved and considered the
final diagnosis and yield.
Outcomes
Four primary outcomes were evaluated. First was the par-
ticipation rate, defined as the total number of participants
divided by the total number of invited inhabitants. Second
was the detection rate, defined as the number of histologi-
cally confirmed skin cancers among the total number of par-
ticipants, as well as the operational effectiveness, defined as
the overall yield in the invited population. Third, the effect
of the screening on anxiety was evaluated by comparing the
VAS scores before and after screening. Fourth, the cost,
expressed as the direct cost per detected lesion, was calcu-
lated for the 2 screening methods. For calculation of the
cost, the measurement and valuation were consistent with
the perspective of the Belgian health care budget and in
accordance with the 2014 National Institute for Health reim-
bursement guidelines in Belgium. For these costs of the
screening program, subsequent treatment and indirect costs
were not taken into account. In addition, the time spent per
screening was assessed to better understand the screening
capacity of both methods. Mortality was not included as an
end point.
Statistical Analysis
All categorical variables were compared using Pearson χ2 test
or Fisher exact test if the conditions for Pearson χ2 test were
not met. Independent-sample or paired-sample t test was used
for continuous variables. Differences are expressed with 95%
CIs. All statistical tests were 2 tailed, and P < .05 was consid-
ered statistically significant. The analyses were conducted
usingstatisticalsoftware(SPSS,version21.0;IBM).Samplesize
calculation of the number of invitees was based on the par-
ticipation rate and effect size of published data and the pilot
study. Power analysis was also conducted using a computer
program (SPSS SamplePower, version 3.0; IBM).
Results
Participation
In total, 1982 individuals were screened in this study. The par-
ticipation rate was 17.9% (1668 of 9325) in the TBE group vs
3.3% (314 of 9484) in the LDS group (P < .01) (Table 1). The sex
distribution was comparable, with a modest female predomi-
nance of 56.2% (1113 of 1982) overall. There was no difference
between groups in the median age. Educational level was
higher in the LDS group, with 16.0% (49 of 306) having a uni-
versity degree compared with 9.9% (163 of 1654) in the TBE
group (P < .01).
Regarding their motivation to participate, 77.3% (1280 of
1655) in the TBE group wanted to obtain a total-body skin
check, whereas 75.8% (238 of 314) in the LDS group consulted

17.8% (56 of 314) in the LDS group had no specific lesion of con-
cernbutconsultedforaTBE.Intotal,90.1%(283of314)ofscre-
enees in the LDS group agreed to a total-body skin check.
Clinical Findings
The clinical findings are summarized in Table 2. Participants
in the 2 groups did not differ significantly regarding Fitzpat-
rick skin type, total nevus count, and the presence of actinic
keratosis or atypical nevi. A positive personal or family his-
tory of skin cancer and the number of participants who had
received at least 1 previous skin check was similar in both
groups at 38.3% (634 of 1655) in the TBE group and 39.2% (123
of 314) in the LDS group.
The clinical suspicion rate was 4.4% (73 of 1668) in the TBE
group vs 3.2% (10 of 314) in the LDS group (P = .66). The most
frequent clinical diagnosis was BCC. Some screenees had more
than 1 clinically suspicious lesion, especially multiple BCCs (1
individual each had 3, 9, and 10 lesions, while 6 individuals
had 2 lesions) and Bowen disease lesions (1 individual had 3
lesions, while 3 individuals had 2 lesions).
Skin Cancer Detection Rate
Thehistologicaldiagnosesof1participantintheLDSgroupand
12 participants in the TBE group could not be retrieved. In the
LDS group, a lesion suspicious for Bowen disease had re-
solved spontaneously when the participant came to the der-
matology office for biopsy. In the TBE group, 1 participant died
before referral, 4 participants chose not to have an excision or
biopsy, and 7 participants postponed excision or biopsy be-
cause of other health problems.
In total, 1982 individuals were screened, and 47 skin can-
cers (2.4%) were histologically confirmed. No suspicious le-
sions were found in screenees younger than 35 years, and the
skin cancer detection rate in the age group 35 years and older
was 3.0% (47 of 1548). Melanoma was detected in 0.5% (9 of
47),1.9%(37of47)hadconfirmedBCC,and0.1%(1of47)mani-
fested SCC or Bowen disease. The positive predictive value
(PPV) for melanoma was 50.0% (95% CI, 0.24-0.76), while
the PPV for BCC was 72.3% (95% CI, 0.58-0.83) (Table 3).
The PPV for SCC or Bowen disease was only 12.5% (95% CI,
0.01-0.49). The overall PPV for skin cancer was 56.6% (95%
CI, 0.46-0.67).
Skin cancer detection rates between the 2 screening meth-
ods did not differ significantly at 2.3% (39 of 1668) for TBE vs
3.2% (8 of 248) for LDS (P = .40). However, in the population
invited for TBE, significantly more skin cancers were de-
tected given the higher participation rate of 0.4% (39 of 9325)
for TBE vs 0.1% (8 of 9484) for LDS (P < .01) (Table 4).
In total, 283 of 314 participants in the LDS group (90.1%)
agreed to have a total-body skin check. Among individuals in
whomtheinitialindexlesionwasnotsuspicious,onlyoneskin
cancer at another site was detected. In a subgroup of 10 par-
ticipants in whom the presented lesion was suspicious, addi-

in 3 persons (confirmed BCC in 2 and confirmed Bowen dis-
ease in 1). Among 66 participants in the LDS group who did not
consult for a specific lesion, only one skin cancer (a con-
firmed BCC) was detected in her total-body check.
Anxiety
Participants in the LDS group had significantly higher base-
line anxiety scores (3.7 points) compared with the TBE group
(3.3 points) as measured by the VAS (P < .01) (Table 5). Among
individuals in whom no suspicious lesion was detected by
screening, a similar reduction in anxiety level of 1.3 points on
theVASwasobservedinbothgroups(P < .01).Inscreeneeswho
were diagnosed as having a suspicious lesion, a small rise in
the level of anxiety of 0.3 points was seen, but this change was
not statistically significant.
Time and Cost
The mean (SD) duration of the complete skin cancer exami-
nationwas232.0(70.1)secondsintheTBEcomparedwith40.9
(67.1) seconds in the LDS (P < .01) group. Therefore, LDS was
5.6 times less time consuming than TBE. Analysis of the time
needed to perform only the clinical examination, without con-
sidering the time to undress, revealed similar mean (SD) re-
sults of 171.6 (62.7) seconds for TBE and 24.2 (31.8) seconds
for LDS.
Reimbursement for the clinical examination, excision, and
pathological analysis was in accordance with the 2014 Na-
tional Institute for Health reimbursement guidelines in Bel-
gium. The total estimated costs of screening per detected skin
cancer were €931 (US $1008) for LDS and €1012 (US $1096) for
TBE. In future work, a Markov model will be designed to de-

Discussion
In this article, we present the results of a study comparing 2
different screening methods for skin cancer by dermatolo-
gists in 2 similar populations. The participation rate, detec-
tion rate, anxiety level, and cost were compared.
Overall, 1982 individuals were screened by this initiative,
and 47 skin cancers (2.4%) were histologically confirmed,
including 9 melanomas (0.5%), 37 BCCs (1.9%), and 1 SCC or
Bowen disease (0.1%). No skin cancers were detected
among 434 individuals in the age group younger than 35
years while the detection rate was 3.0% (47 of 1548) in those
35 years and older. In addition, the PPV for all suspicious
lesions was 56.6%. Definitive histological diagnoses were
missing for 13 lesions. Therefore, the rate of false-positive
findings, an important adverse effect of screening, ranged
between 27.7% and 44.6%.
These detection rates and PPVs were high compared with
other screening initiatives. The largest European study to date
is the screening in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein,
which reported a histological yield of 0.8% malignant lesions
(0.5% BCC, 0.1% SCC, and 0.2% melanoma) and a false-
positive rate of 74.3%.5,26 The use of dermoscopy could have
led to a higher diagnostic accuracy in the present study. The
odds for detecting melanoma have been shown to increase by
at least 9 times with dermoscopy compared with naked-eye
examination.17 However, some of this difference could also be
explained by study design variation. In the screening de-
scribed herein, a team of dermatologists highly experienced
in skin cancer and dermoscopy was involved, whereas in Ger-
many nondermatologists may participate in screening after an
8-hour course on clinical detection of skin cancer. Therefore,
it is possible that the false-negative rate was high in the Ger-
man study because some patients with suspicious lesions
may not have been correctly referred to a dermatologist,
resulting in an overall lower yield of malignant lesions.
Data from the Euromelanoma campaigns rarely report
complete histological follow-up for NMSC. The yield for his-
tologically confirmed melanoma varies among different Eu-
ropean countries. In the 2009 and 2010 campaigns, the total
detection rate was 0.35% among all participating countries.27
Only one campaign in Switzerland included NMSC histologi-
cal findings, resulting in detection rates of 0.38% for BCC and
0.15% for SCC.27-29 During the 2009 Euromelanoma cam-
paign in Belgium, 2652 participants were screened, and 12
melanomas were found, resulting in a detection rate of 0.45%,
which is similar to our findings.27 Their PPV for melanoma was
22.2% compared with 50.0% in our study, although dermos-
copy was used in 94.4% of their examinations.
Compared with TBE, LDS had a lower operational effec-
tiveness, with TBE detecting 5 times more skin cancers in the
population. However, the detection rates were not signifi-
cantly different between the 2 screening methods (2.3% [39
of 1668] for TBE vs 3.2% [8 of 2480] for LDS, P = .40). Further-
more, LDS was 5.6 times less time consuming than TBE and
resulted in lower costs per detected skin cancer. The opera-
tional effectiveness of LDS can be increased if whole-body
screening is offered to individuals in whom the initial index
lesion that was the reason for participation was not suspi-
cious on clinical examination. A large 2-step screening study30
offered a TBE after dermatologists performed an inspection of
the problem area. The researchers found that, if a skin tumor
was the reason for consultation (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.0-
4.8) or if a suspicious lesion was found at the problem area
(odds ratio, 6.8; 95% CI, 5.2-9.0), the risk of missing a skin can-
cer significantly increased when no additional TBE was per-
formed. A large proportion of patients with BCC develop mul-
tiple BCCs over time, and some of these patients are seen with
synchronous BCCs.31 In our study, 3 of 10 patients had a sec-
ond confirmed BCC or Bowen disease after being seen with a
confirmed malignant lesion on LDS. Total-body examination
seems to be the most complete skin cancer screening that can
be offered to a population. However, because of budgetary and
medical staff challenges that health care systems face today
andthatresultinwaitingliststoseeadermatologist,LDSmight
be a viable alternative.

The participation rate in the TBE group herein was com-
parabletotheparticipationrateof19.1%intheGermanSCREEN
(Skin Cancer Research to Provide Evidence for Effectiveness
of Screening in Northern Germany) project.32 The almost 5
timeslowerparticipationrateintheLDSgrouphereincanlikely
be explained by the specific message on the invitation or the
stated conditions to participate because all other aspects of the
sensitization campaign were similar and because the 2 par-
ticipating areas were socioeconomically comparable accord-
ing to official statistics. In the TBE group, 109 of 1655 partici-
pants(6.6%)attendedthescreeningbecausetheywereworried
about 1 or more lesions compared with 238 of 314 partici-
pants in the LDS group (75.8%). Therefore, the message on the
invitation was correctly interpreted by most individuals in the
LDS group, probably resulting in a general lower participa-
tion rate. In screening, higher educational levels lead to greater
participation. Our data showed a significantly higher educa-
tional level in the LDS group, with 49.0% (150 of 306) of par-
ticipants having a higher education or a university degree
compared with 41.7% (689 of 1654) of participants in the TBE
group. This finding could be related to the more complex
and selective message communicated to the LDS group and
deserves attention because lower socioeconomic class is an
important risk factor for nonparticipation in health care
programs and for more advanced cancers at diagnosis.33,34
Efforts to increase the participation rate in the LDS group by
means of sensitization campaigns using television, social
media, and extra reminders should be examined to fully
exploit the benefits of the LDS method and raise its overall
yield. Introduction of a preventive health care pathway
managed by GPs could benefit the current socioeconomic
discrimination in screening campaigns.
Melanoma is one of the most aggressive of all skin can-
cers. However, the screening cost per melanoma detected in
our study was high, raising the question whether it can be cost-
effective to focus only on melanoma. In this study, the screen-
ing cost per melanoma detected varied between €4631 (US
$5015) and €7449 (US $8067). Nonmelanoma skin cancers rep-
resent a higher direct cost in the health care budget. Their early
detection can help to reduce this cost because when applied
to early-stage disease the treatment options are less costly and
more effective.35
To our knowledge, no studies evaluating anxiety in skin
cancer screening have been published to date, and this ad-
verse effect is frequently used as an argument against screen-
ing. The literature suggests that a high-anxiety state should be
defined at 1 SD above the normative mean, or a value exceed-
ing 45 on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.36 This definition
correlates with a VAS score cutoff of greater than 2 points, with
a sensitivity of 76.7% and a specificity of 64.9%.22 Our results
show that the mean anxiety level dropped significantly in both
groups by 1.2 points after a negative screening result (P < .01).
In the case of a positive screening result, anxiety level did not
increase significantly. It is possible that anxiety was induced
by the personal invitations sent out 5 weeks in advance, re-
sulting in a subsequent return to baseline levels. An anxiety
measurementobtainedbeforesendingouttheinvitationwould
provideamoreaccurateeffectoftheintervention.Anxietylevel
prescreening was 0.4 points higher in the LDS group com-
pared with the TBE group (P < .01). This effect is likely be-
cause of the perceived alarming nature of the information re-
garding skin cancer on the LDS invitation. The anxiety level
of 109 participants having a specific lesion of concern in the
TBE group was comparable to the prescreening level of anxi-
etyintheLDSgroup(mean3.7,P = .95).Therefore,itisnotonly

Conclusions
Ingeneral,thisstudyobtainedahighskincancerdetectionrate
and PPV compared with other screening initiatives. There was
also high male participation relative to other screenings. Im-
portant factors in establishing skin cancer screening are com-
munity-based sensitization campaigns and personal invita-
tions to participate, as well as screening teams with
dermatologists experienced in using dermoscopy.
Total-body examination yielded a higher absolute num-
ber of skin cancers in the invited population. Lesion-directed
screeninghadasimilardetectionrateof3.2%butwas5.6times
less time consuming. When performed by dermatologists, LDS
is an acceptable alternative screening method, especially in
health care systems with limited budgets or long waiting lists.
The effectiveness of skin cancer screening by nondermatolo-
gists warrants further study. It is important to increase the par-
ticipationrateinLDSandthustheabsolutenumberofskincan-
cers detected, noting any differences in screenees’educational
levels and skin cancer awareness. Among participants herein
in whom the initial index lesion was not suspicious, only one
skin cancer at another site was detected. This finding sug-
gests that a TBE would primarily be indicated if an individual
is seen with a suspicious lesion.
