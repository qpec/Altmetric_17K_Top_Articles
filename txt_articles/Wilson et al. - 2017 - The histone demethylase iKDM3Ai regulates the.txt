ABSTRACT
The lysine demethylase 3A (KDM3A, JMJD1A or JHDM2A) controls transcriptional 
networks in a variety of biological processes such as spermatogenesis, metabolism, 
stem cell activity, and tumor progression. We matched transcriptomic and ChIP-
Seq profiles to decipher a genome-wide regulatory network of epigenetic control 
by KDM3A in prostate cancer cells. ChIP-Seq experiments monitoring histone 3 
lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation marks show global histone demethylation effects of 
KDM3A. Combined assessment of histone demethylation events and gene expression 
changes presented major transcriptional activation suggesting that distinct oncogenic 
regulators may synergize with the epigenetic patterns by KDM3A. Pathway enrichment 
analysis of cells with KDM3A knockdown prioritized androgen signaling indicating 
that KDM3A plays a key role in regulating androgen receptor activity. Matched ChIP-
Seq and knockdown experiments of KDM3A in combination with ChIP-Seq of the 
androgen receptor resulted in a gain of H3K9 methylation marks around androgen 
receptor binding sites of selected transcriptional targets in androgen signaling 
including positive regulation of KRT19, NKX3-1, KLK3, NDRG1, MAF, CREB3L4, MYC, 
INPP4B, PTK2B, MAPK1, MAP2K1, IGF1, E2F1, HSP90AA1, HIF1A, and ACSL3. The 
cancer systems biology analysis of KDM3A-dependent genes identifies an epigenetic 
and transcriptional network in androgen response, hypoxia, glycolysis, and lipid 
metabolism. Genome-wide ChIP-Seq data highlights specific gene targets and the 
ability of epigenetic master regulators to control oncogenic pathways and cancer 
progression.
INTRODUCTION
Methylation of histone lysine residues is a significant 
component of epigenetics and is associated with control 
of gene expression [1]. Specifically, methylation of lysine 
9 of histone H3 (H3K9) has been recognized as hallmark 
of transcriptionally suppressed genes [2]. KDM3A (lysine 
demethylase 3A; Gene ID: 55818; also referred to as 
JMJD1A or JHDM2A) is crucial for gene regulation in a 
variety of biological activities such as spermatogenesis, 
metabolism, stem cell activity and tumor progression 
by demethylating mono- or di-methylated H3K9 [3–5]. 
Although the KDM3A protein regulates a wide array of 
target genes in tissue- and development-specific settings, 
chromatin modifiers often lack intrinsic DNA sequence 
specificity. Therefore, how KDM3A is targeted to specific 
genes is an area of current research interest and important for 
understanding epigenetic dysregulation in human disease.
KDM3A activity is deregulated in several cancers 
[3, 6–8]. In prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), KDM3A

functions as a transcriptional coactivator for the androgen 
receptor (AR; Gene ID: 367) [3, 9]. The ability to cooperate 
with the AR highlights a potential role of KDM3A as 
coactivator and driving force for sex-specific tissue 
development as well as for prostate cancer initiation and 
progression. In PRAD, androgen-dependent signaling 
plays a key role in the oncogenesis of prostate epithelial 
cells and the aggressiveness of the malignancy [10, 
11]. The AR transcription factor belongs to the nuclear 
receptor superfamily and contains a C-terminal ligand-
binding domain. Upon ligand binding, the AR undergoes 
a conformational change and dissociates from a cytosolic 
chaperone protein complex. Its ligand-bound conformation 
allows the AR to dimerize and to translocate into the nucleus 
[12]. Once in the nucleus, the activated AR dimer binds to 
androgen response elements (AREs) present in the promoter 
or enhancer of AR-regulated target genes and recruits co-
activators or co-repressors to regulate gene expression [13]. 
In addition to the AR, KDM3A has been found to regulate 
expression and/or activity of several transcription factors 
such as PPARG, KLF2, ESR1, and HOXA1 [14–17].
In order to further elucidate the impact of 
KDM3A on the epigenome, we performed chromatin 
immunoprecipitation in combination with next generation 
sequencing (ChIP-Seq) of its binding and demethylation 
activity. We quantified changes of H3K9me1 or H3K9me2 
marks, the two substrates of KDM3A, and mapped AR-
binding in the CWR22Rv1 prostate cancer cell line in 
combination with knockdown of KDM3A. Alteration of 
H3K9 methylation marks mapped to genomic locations 
coinciding with AR binding pinpoints target genes and 
oncogenic pathways cooperatively regulated by KDM3A 
and AR.
RESULTS
Genomic annotation and transcriptional 
regulation of KDM3A specific demethylase 
activity
Knockdown of KDM3A in CWR22Rv1 cells showed 
minor effects on global levels of H3K9me1 or H3K9me2 by 
Western blot analysis (Figure 1A), suggesting that KDM3A 
demethylates a small pool of methylated histone marks and 
regulates a specific set of gene targets. In order to establish 
the genome-wide impact of the epigenetic regulator 
KDM3A, we conducted a matched ChIP-Seq experiment 
using antibodies specific for histone marks H3K9me1 
and H3K9me2 in combination with small hairpin RNA

B-C. H3K9me1-antibody and D-E. H3K9me2-antibody show specific gain of signal following small hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown

and 1002 genes as negatively regulated by KDM3A activity. I. Transcriptomic impact of KDM3A knockdown shows 58.4% of gene

(shRNA) knockdown of KDM3A in the CWR22Rv1 cell 
line (Supplementary Table 1). Histone lysine demethylation 
(KDM) events mediated by KDM3A were defined by gain 
of methylation ChIP-Seq signals following knockdown 
of KDM3A (Figure 1B–1E). Alterations of H3K9me1 
and H3K9me2 histone marks upon KDM3A knockdown 
were evaluated in comparison to reference genomic DNA 
input or control non-coding shRNA samples. Overall, the 
peak counts of both H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 ChIP-Seq 
experiments showed a gain of signal (32244 to 34162 and 
23353 to 46599, respectively). Since H3K9 methylation is a 
mark associated with the highly condensed heterochromatin 
state, we characterized the specific genomic regions 
associated with both H3K9 histone methylation marks. 
KDM events were functionally annotated by mapping 
bound regions to the human genome and by classifying 
them according to the nearest gene locus and relative 
position within coding regions. Promoter or transcription 
start sites (TSS) and transcription termination sites (TTS) 
genomic annotations are defined as being within ± 1000 bp 
of the gene-coding body. Intergenic regions were defined 
as the remaining regions outside the gene body. In the 
H3K9me1 ChIP-Seq experiment the intergenic regions were 
the most frequently found region with 21112 peaks (46.5%) 
followed by 21495 (47.7%) as intronic regions, 822 (1.8%) 
as exonic regions, 606 (1.3%) as promoter-TSS regions, 
549 (1.2%) as TTS regions, 424 (0.9%) as 3’UTR regions, 
and 46 (0.1%) as 5’ untranscribed (UTR) regions (Figure 
1C). Similarly, the H3K9me2 ChIP-Seq had the intergenic 
region as its most frequent region with 18195 (55.9%) 
followed by 13167 (55.9%) as intronic regions, 373 (1.1%) 
as exonic regions, 355 (1.1%) as promoter-TSS regions, 246 
(0.8%) as TTS regions, 204 (0.6%) as 3’UTR regions, and 
25 (0.1%) as 5’ UTR regions (Figure 1E). Taken together, 
ChIP-Seq profiles monitoring histone 3 lysine 9 methylation 
marks following KDM3A knockdown revealed selective 
histone demethylation effects of this epigenetic modifier.
Following genomic annotation, we were curious if 
there was a specific gene expression program underlying 
demethylation of H3K9me1 and H3K9me2. Half of the 
detected genes, 8841 (55.1%), contain both H3K9me1/2 
marks (Figure 1F–1G). While the ChIP-Seq data shows that 
H3K9me1 has more annotated genes compared to H3K9me2 
(5121 and 2089 respectively), both histone marks showed 
an equal fraction of genes being transcriptionally responsive 
to KDM3A knockdown according to the transcriptomic 
dataset. Overall, from the transcriptomic experiments, 1408 
(58.4%; using a significance cutoff with adjusted p-values 
below 0.05) genes are reported as differentially down-
regulated upon shRNA knockdown of KDM3A while 1002 
genes are reported as up-regulated by KDM3A knockdown 
(Figure 1H–1I). The combination of ChIP-Seq histone 
demethylation events and transcriptomic assessment showed 
major transcriptional activation by KDM3A, suggesting 
that KDM3A may synergize with distinct transcriptional 
regulators for epigenetic control of gene expression.
Identification of an epigenetic and 
transcriptional network in androgen receptor 
signaling regulated by KDM3A
Following characterization of histone H3K9me1/2 
marks we determined enrichment of transcriptional 
motifs associated with these histone marks controlled by 
KDM3A in prostate cancer cells. The goal of this analysis 
is to identify potential transcription factors that cooperate 
with KDM3A to regulate gene expression. Using the 
Jaspar motif database, we conducted an unbiased search 
for significant enrichment of transcription factor families 
(analysis of motif enrichment search with p-values below 
0.05). Top hits included the androgen receptor, sterol 
regulatory element binding factor (SREBF), hypoxia 
inducible factor (HIF), activator protein 1 (AP1) complex 
of JUN/FOS, Krüppel-like factors (KLF), v-myc avian 
myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC), and 
forkhead box (FOX) families of transcription factors with 
significant enrichments and p-values below 1.0E-04 
(Table 1). In addition, we enhanced simple ChIP-Seq-based 
 
searches with position-specific matrices to determine 
which transcription factor motifs were enriched compared 
to shuffled background sequences. The enrichment 
analysis showed the androgen response element (ARE) 
with 2915 incidences as one of the most frequent motifs 
detected (Table 1). Next, we analyzed significantly altered 
expression levels upon KDM3A shRNA knockdown 
(Figure 2A). At the transcriptional level, the androgen 
response gene set was the most enriched with a p-value 
and false discovery rate q-value each below 1.0E-20 
(Figure 2B). Next, we sought inferred transcriptional 
regulators by comparing transcriptional targets to datasets 
that outline targets of transcription factors through the use 
of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The transcription factors 
AR, HIF, MYC, and AP1 complex were significantly 
enriched with p-values below 1.0E-07. Lastly, we 
merged ChIP-Seq profiles of H3K9Me1/2 and KDM3A 
transcriptional data focusing on 1408 annotated genes 
(overlap of H3K9ME1/2 ChIP-Seq with transcriptomic 
data that were down-regulated upon shRNA KDM3A 
knockdown) (Figure 1I, Supplementary Table 2). The 
data contained the highest enrichment ratio (26.7%) 
in a significantly enriched set of 27 genes in androgen 
signaling with p-values below 1.0E-17 and q-values 
below 1.0E-15 (Supplementary Table 3). In detail, putative 
KDM3A-regulated genes included pathways involved 
in androgen response, androgen receptor signaling, 
androgen biosynthesis, prostate cancer, pathways in 
cancer, cholesterol homeostasis, bile acid metabolism, 
aldosterone-regulated reabsorption, and progesterone 
regulation, hinting at the possibility of hormone nuclear 
steroid receptor involvement (enrichment with p-values 
below 2.62E-02 and q-values below 9.35E-02 correcting 
for multiple hypotheses testing) (Table 2). Interestingly

by all of these different enrichment approaches, suggesting 
a key role for KDM3A in regulating AR activity.
Matched KDM and AR ChIP-Seq experiments 
reveal coincidence of demethylase binding, 
demethylation and AR binding events
Knockdown of KDM3A in CWR22Rv1 cells resulted 
in loss of KDM3A ChIP-Seq binding accompanied by 
specific, matched gain of histone lysine 9 demethylation 
(Figure 4A–4C). Knockdown of KDM3A had little 
effect on the protein level of AR [3, 18]. We examined 
the alteration of AR binding by ChIP-Seq with an AR 
antibody following KDM3A knockdown and quantified 
the overlap of AR ChIP-Seq events with KDM3A binding 
and changes in epigenetic H3K9me1/2 marks (Figure 
4A–4D). The activity-based ChIP-Seq array matched with 
knockdown of KDM3A resulted in 37525 peaks associated 
with KDM3A binding, 45246 and 32665 H3K9 mono- and 
di-demethylation (H3K9me1/2-KDM) events, respectively, 
and 34614 peaks for KDM3A-matched AR binding. Such 
an experimental design allows one to distinguish between 
histone demethylase binding (Figure 4E), epigenetic 
activity (Figure 4F), and coactivator binding events (Figure 
4G). Gain of H3K9me1/2 was coupled to specific changes 
in AR binding in the KDM3A knockdown experiments 
(Figure 1A–1E). Overall 37.0% of the AR ChIP-Seq 
peaks with altered H3K9me1/2 signal were suppressed 
upon knockdown of KDM3A, while the remaining fraction 
was not affected. The genome-wide ChIP-Seq analysis is 
consistent with the biochemical data, demonstrating that 
KDM3A in effect recruited AR to target genes [3, 18]. 
KDM3A ChIP-Seq and H3K9me1/2-KDM ChIP-Seq 
in combination with matched knockdown of KDM3A 
produced an epigenetic network that overlaid with the AR 
ChIP-Seq data (Figure 4H–4J). In the case of matched 
and merged datasets of AR ChIP-Seq in combination with 
KDM3A knockdown, we identified in total 77911 H3K9me 
peaks (Figure 4F) and directly overlaid them with 34614 
AR peaks containing 121700 ARE motifs (Figure 4I). 
Importantly, using such matched ChIP-Seq analyses, a set 
of 1912 genes was identified that showed an overlap of 
demethylation and AR binding events (KDM3A/AR ChIP, 
2381 peaks, 1912 genes) (Figure 4I, Supplementary Table 
1). Epigenetic events identified by ChIP-Seq were overlaid 
with transcriptomic data, defining a set of 421 genes that

had epigenetic marks (H3K9me1/2 ChIP), AR binding (AR

KDM3A and AR coactivation results in 
oncogenic pathway activation of AR signaling
H3K9 demethylation is known for stimulating gene 
expression [3, 5, 19, 20]. We used gene set enrichment 
analysis to identify signaling networks or functional 
clusters of genes controlled by both KDM3A and AR. 
At the gene level we studied pathway enrichment for the 
following three sets: A) 1912 genes defined by overlapping 
H3K9 demethylation/AR ChIP (Figure 4I, Supplementary 
Table 1-2); B) 421 genes defined by overlapping H3K9 
demethylation/AR ChIP with differential expression upon 
KDM3A/AR knockdown (Figure 4K, Supplementary 
Table 2); and C) 260 genes that are down-regulated upon 
KDM3A or AR knockdown and having overlapping H3K9 
demethylation/AR ChIP (Figure 4K, Supplementary Table 
2). The gene sets were designed in a hierarchical fashion 
such that the parental set A of 1912 genes includes subset 
B of 421 genes, and B includes subset C of 260 genes 
(Supplementary Table 2). Such a hierarchical structure of 
gene sets allows one to monitor and identify requirements 
and conservation of a functional outcome. The gene 
set enrichment analysis revealed oncogenic activation 
of androgen signaling and metabolic pathways with 
p-values below 1.40E-02 and q-values below 4.44E-02 in 
hypoxic response, glycolysis, and lipogenic metabolism 
(Table 3, Supplementary Table 5). Enrichments of 
androgen response, metabolic pathways, hypoxia, 
aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorption, glycolytic and 
glycerophospholipid metabolism pathways were conserved 
and enriched from the overlapping H3K9 demethylation/
AR ChIP (1912 genes) to the genes displaying down-
regulation upon KDM3A/AR knockdown and overlapping 
H3K9 demethylation/AR ChIP signal (260 genes). For 
example, androgen response and metabolic pathways 
showed incrementally higher enrichment with better 
defined input gene sets (significant enrichment of genes in 
androgen response with p-value of 7.51E-07 for 1912 gene 
set and decreased p-value of 5.23E-09 for 260 gene set). 
Similarly, pathways of glycolytic and glycerophospholipid 
metabolism showed consistently higher enrichment with 
the lowest p-values in the set of 260 genes, indicating 
that KDM3A demethylation targets these pathways and 
causes an up-regulation of gene expression. Of all genes 
detected by both H3K9 demethylation and AR ChIP-
Seq experiments as well as KDM3A and AR differential 
expression following knockdown (core set of 45 genes; 
28 genes up-regulated; 17 genes down-regulated), the 
AR response was the only significantly enriched pathway 
with a p-value of 5.29E-08. 7 genes, NDRG1, PTK2B, 
ACSL3, KRT19, INPP4B, NKX3-1, and MAF, with direct 
implication in AR signaling were present in all gene 
sets of the hierarchical enrichment analyses, thereby 
subject to KDM3A control by H3K9 demethylation, AR 
binding, and differential expression following knockdown 
(Supplementary Table 1-3, 5). In the androgen response 
pathway KDM3A and AR had strong ChIP-Seq activity 
(Table 4). The majority of epigenetic H3K9 demethylation 
events resulted in up-regulation of target gene activity 
and occurred at the TSSs of target genes. In addition, 
multiple introns, exons, and TTS of target genes were 
also implicated in KDM3A control. A network upstream 
regulator analysis implicated the AR to coordinate 
with epigenetic and transcriptional responses observed 
upon knockdown of KDM3A (Supplementary Table 
6). At the transcriptional level, KDM3A may affect AR 
signaling directly by interacting with regulatory regions 
of HSP90AA1 and AR genes. In addition, downstream 
effects of AR signaling were observed at KRT19, NKX3-
1, KLK3, TMPRSS2, PMEPA1, NDRG1, MAF, CREB3L4, 
MYC, INPP4B, PTK2B, MAPK1, MAP2K1, IGF1, E2F1, 
HIF1A, TARP, FKBP5, SPDEF, SMS, PPAP2A, SEPP1, 
UAP1, SORD, AZGP1, BCL2L1, ACSL3, CHUK, and 
CDKN1A (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
Epigenetic regulators like KDM3A specifically 
demethylate histone marks H3K9me1 and H3K9me2, 
thereby playing a central role in the histone code. In cancer, 
demethylation and decondensation of chromatin can lead to 
dysregulated gene expression and transcriptional activation 
of gene targets [21]. Previous cell biological studies have 
suggested that KDM3A may stimulate transcription 
mediated by nuclear receptors and/or that KDM3A may 
be involved in activation of forkhead proteins during 
cell differentiation [17, 22]. While histone modifiers are 
not limited to specific DNA cognate sites, transcriptional 
specificity can be accomplished by cooperation with 
transcription factors recognizing distinct DNA motifs [13].
The chosen bioinformatics approach of quantifying 
changes of matched epigenetic remodeling in combination 
with transcription factor ChIP-Seq and transcriptomic 
analysis following knockdown of an epigenetic 
master regulator offers insight from two angles: it can 
identify in an unbiased way genome-wide cooperation 
of epigenetic remodeling with other members of the 
transcriptional machinery, and it can elucidate details 
of the interaction. In prostate cancer, steroid ligand 
dependency or independency can influence the prognostic 
outcome. The CWR22Rv1 cell line offers the benefit 
 Oncotarget

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
of being able to probe a static, aggressive end point of 
the disease, while it has limitations due to lacking the 
dynamic ligand-dependent aspect of AR signaling. Since 
the CWR22Rv1 cell line expressed permanently activated 
AR without the ligand binding domain, it provides a stable 
model for studying the dynamic response to epigenetic 
regulation by KDM3A knockdown in combination with 
ChIP-Seq analysis. KDM3A knockdown abolished tumor 
formation in an orthotopic prostate tumor model using 
CWR22Rv1 cells [18]. Interestingly, KDM3A knockdown 
in other prostate cancer cell lines, including the androgen 
dependent LNCaP cells, blocked cell proliferation [18].
Androgen signaling is subject to multilevel 
control. In addition to agonist and antagonist ligand 
chaperones, intracellular localization and interactions 
with other transcription factors or histone modifiers can 
influence the transcriptional outcome. Multiple epigenetic 
regulators have been described to interact with the AR. 
KDM4C co-localizes with the androgen receptor in 
prostate carcinomas, and knockdown of KDM4C inhibits 
transcriptional activation and tumor cell proliferation [23]. 
KDM3A is involved in spermatogenesis by regulating 
expression of target genes such as PRM1 and TMP1, 
which are required for packaging and condensation of

The analysis is focused on coactivation by KDM3A/AR ChIP and transcriptomic change upon knockdown. Input gene 
sets were defined by coactivation by KDM/AR ChIP-Seq (1912 genes; marked with *), coactivation by KDM/AR ChIP-
Seq and transcriptomic change upon KDM3A/AR knockdown (421 genes; marked with **), oncogenic gene up-regulation 
by KDM3A/AR and KDM/AR ChIP coactivation (260 genes; marked with **) (compare Figure 4). Comprehensive lists 
of gene sets and enrichment ratios are deposited in the Supplementary Information. To determine significance of pathway 
enrichment thresholds of 0.05 and 0.10 were used for p-values and q-values, respectively according to multiple hypotheses 
testing using the controlling procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg.

sperm chromatin [3]. Furthermore, its involvement in 
obesity resistance through regulation of metabolic genes 
such as PPARA and UCP1 highlight a transcriptional 
network focused on lipid modifiers.
In this epigenetic and transcriptomic study we aimed 
to outline specific pathways of KDM3A demethylase 
action and enriched transcriptional networks under 
its control. Previous studies have outlined KDM3A 
expression levels in prostate cancer phenotypes [24], but 
KDM3A-regulated target pathways by ChIP-Seq analysis 
were unknown [24–26]. Motif-guided searches for 
cooperating transcription factors can link transcriptional 
programs with genome-wide histone modifications. 
Motifs of SREBP, HIF, AP1, KLF, MYC, and FOX 
families are enriched in the H3K9me1/2-KDM ChIP-Seq 
data and were described to play a role in prostate cancer 
progression [3, 9, 27–31]. However, of the enriched 
transcription factors characterized so far, only AR and 
MYC have strong biochemical links to KDM3A [3, 18]. 
Solely based on KDM3A regulation of ChIP-Seq and 
transcriptomic data, a gene set of 1408 genes revealed 
androgen-related signaling as top hit. Within the androgen 
response, transcriptionally validated genes, NKX3-1 and 
KLK3, have been shown to have dynamically regulated 
histone modification states [32].
In a second step, matched ChIP-Seq studies of 
KDM3A and the AR allowed us to focus on a distinct 
transcriptional network. Aside from the androgen 
response, cellular metabolism is highly enriched in 
the executioner program of KDM3A and the AR. In 
particular, lipogenic and hypoxic metabolism stand out 
for their regulation in the combined KDM3A/AR ChIP-
Seq and transcriptomic data. Previously established AR 
targets involved in cellular metabolism include ACSL3, 
which is involved in converting free long chain fatty acids 
into fatty acyl-CoA esters [33, 34]. Genome-wide ChIP-
Seq profiles show that KDM3A regulates the expression 
of FKBP5, CHUK, HSP90AA1, and VHL. These genes 
were previously implicated as being regulated by the AR 
and their proteomic function is involved in AR folding, 
transactivation, and translocation in the nucleus [35–38]. 
HSP90AA1 is described to be under the control of KDM3A 
[39–41]. Prominent shared targets of KDM3A and AR 
include gene targets associated with hypoxic metabolism. 
Transcriptional regulation in response to hypoxia is 
regulated by the actions of HIF1A and controls glycolytic

metabolism [42]. Previously, KDM3A gene expression was 
identified as one of the genes under control of HIF1A [43]. 
In addition, there is increased transcriptional activity of AR 
within castration-resistant prostate cancer by hypoxia [44]. 
A similar overlapping network of KDM3A demethylation, 
nuclear hormone signaling, and hypoxia is described 
in estrogen independent breast cancer models [16]. 
KDM3A’s ability to regulate metabolic gene expression 
by controlling AR binding site availability in hypoxic cells 
may be the molecular action KDM3A utilizes to stimulate 
tumor progression [45]. The additional enriched pathways 
with shared KDM3A and AR regulation appear to the 
hypoxic cell response. Cytokine and metabolic signaling 
is able to induce expression of HIF1A and promote its 
activation in an oncogenic fashion [46–51].
The functional impact of coordinated action 
between a lysine demethylase and transcription factors 
may lend to its target specificity, or at the very least, 
create accessibility for DNA binding [52–56]. KDM3A 
controlled H3K9me1/2 ChIP-Seq data shows a strong 
enrichment of AR binding sites within the CWR22Rv1 
castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line with continued 
expression of genes involved in the androgen response. 
However, about a third of the AR ChIP-Seq peaks were 
suppressed in response to increased H3K9me1/2 signal 
in the KDM3A experiments. It remains to be determined 
which other coactivators and corepressors take charge of 
AR binding sites in genomic locations where KDM3A 
has no effect on AR binding or transcriptional response. 
Notably, selected KDM3A- or AR-dependent genes show 
no clear association of modulated H3K9me1/2 marks 
within 50,000 bp around the gene body, suggesting 
that KDM3A can regulate gene expression either by 
accessing distant enhancers or by physical interaction 
with the transcriptional machinery independent of H3K9 
demethylation. For example, KDM3A was identified to 
erase lysine 372 monomethylation of TP53, a protein 
methylation site crucial for the stability and pro-apoptotic 
function of chromatin-bound tumor suppressor [57]. 
Significantly, next to the AR, SREBF, and HIF, the 
conducted transcription factor motif analysis confirmed a 
strong presence of TP53 target sequences controlled by 
KDM3A. Extensive future ChIP-Seq studies of KDM3A 
as well as other candidate transcription factors associated 
with KDM3A will be necessary to further characterize the 
full spectrum of epigenetic and transcriptional control of 
the master regulator KDM3A.
In conclusion, the ChIP-Seq study refined the 
genomic sites of KDM3A-mediated H3K9me1/2 
histone demethylation within the CWR22Rv1 prostate 
cancer cell line. The cancer systems biology analysis 
expanded 
underlying 
transcription 
factor 
motifs 
associated with oncogenic KDM3A demethylation, 
suggesting an underlying transcriptional network that 
directs transcriptional activation. Future experimental 
verification of epigenetic hotspots is needed to determine 
when detected response elements are functional in gene 
regulation. The matched transcriptomics and epigenomics 
approach identified an overlap between androgen receptor 
ChIP-Seq and KDM3A-regulated H3K9me1/2 ChIP-Seq. 
The comprehensive genome-wide mapping of matched 
ChIP-Seq profiles highlighted mechanistic details of 
how an epigenetic master regulator can exhibit control 
over selected transcriptional programs, such as metabolic 
pathways and hypoxia response in cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue culture of prostate cancer cell lines
CWR22Rv1 is a human prostate carcinoma 
epithelial cell line derived from a xenograft that was 
serially propagated in mice after castration-induced 
regression and relapse of the parental, androgen-dependent 
CWR22 xenograft [58, 59] (CRL-2505, American Type 
Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). The CWR22Rv1 
prostate cancer cell line was kindly provided by Dr. 
James Jacobberger (Case Western Reserve University, 
Cleveland, OH), and are maintained in RPMI 1640 
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 
antibiotics. Cell cultures are regularly tested to ensure 
absence of mycoplasma. The CWR22Rv1 prostate cancer 
cell line expresses AR full-length with a duplicated DNA 
binding domain in exon 3 and AR splice variants, for 
example AR-v7, lacking a ligand binding domain. Thus, 
the CWR22Rv1 cell line displays constitutively active 
AR even in the absence of androgen [59]. In the ChIP-
Seq study an AR antibody (PG21, 06-680, Sigma EMD 
Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) was used recognizing 
both forms of the AR. All experimental protocols were 
approved by the Institutional Review Board at the 
University of California Merced. The study was carried 
out as part of IRB UCM13-0025 of the University of 
California Merced and as part of dbGap ID 5094 on 
somatic mutations in cancer and conducted in accordance 
with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975.
Knockdown of KDM3A with shRNA
Lentiviral vectors encoding KDM3A small hairpin 
RNA (shRNA), AR shRNA or lentiviral pLKO.1 control 
shRNA were purchased from Open Biosystems (GE 
Healthcare Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO), and packaged 
in human embryonic kidney 293T cells (CRL-3216, 
American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) 
by calcium phosphate transfection. The supernatant 
containing lentiviral particles were collected 48 hours 
after transfection. CWR22Rv1 cells were transduced 
with the supernatant of lentiviral particles in the presence 
of polybrene (8 μg/ml) for 24 hours before replacement 
with the fresh growth media. Cells were analyzed at 48 
hours post-transduction. The knockdown efficiency was 
confirmed by quantitative real time polymerase chain 
reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western-blot analysis.

qRT-PCR analysis
Total RNA from prostate cancer cells was extracted 
using a mammalian RNA mini preparation kit (RTN10-1KT, 
GenElute, Sigma EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and 
then digested with deoxyribonuclease I (AMPD1-1KT, Sigma 
EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Complementary 
DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using random hexamers. 
Triple replicate samples were subjected to SYBR green 
(SYBR green master mix, Qiagen SABiosciences) qRT-
PCR analysis in an Eco system (Illumina, San Diego). 
Gene expression profiles were analyzed using the ΔΔCT 
method. qRT-PCR threshold cycle (CT) values were 
normalized using the housekeeping gene cyclophilin A 
(PPIA; peptidylprolyl isomerase A; Gene ID: 5478). The

Western-blot analysis
Whole cell lysates were harvested using radio-
immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer composed of 50 
mM trisaminomethane hydrochloride (Tris-HCl) pH7.5, 
150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% 
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 
1.0 mM EDTA, 1.0 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 1x 
protease inhibitor cocktail. Lysates were subjected to 
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
(SDS-PAGE) and proteins transferred to a nitrocellulose 
membrane (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA). 
The membrane was probed with ChIP-grade H3K9me1 
(ab9045, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), H3K9me2 (07-441, 
Sigma EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), KDM3A 
(A301-539A, Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX), 
or ACTB (A5441, Sigma EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, 
Germany) antibodies followed by a secondary antibody 
conjugated to fluorescent dye, and blots were imaged using 
the odyssey detecting system (LI-COR Biotechnology, 
Bad Homburg, Germany).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Cells were crosslinked using 1% formaldehyde 
for 10 min at 298 K. Formaldehyde was removed and 
cells were incubated with 125 mM glycine for 5 min at 
298 K. Nuclear extracts were collected and sonicated to 
obtain 300 bp chromatin fragments using the Covaris 
S2 ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn, MA). 100 μg of 
chromatin was incubated with 5 μg of AR (PG21, 06-680, 
Sigma EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), 5 μg of 
KDM3A (A301-538A, Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, 
TX), 2 μg of H3K9me1 (ab9045, Abcam, Cambridge, 
MA), or 2 μg of H3K9me2 (07-441, Sigma EMD 
Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) antibodies overnight 
at 277 K followed by incubation with 30 μl of protein 
A/G beads for 4 hours. After four washes, crosslinking 
was reversed. Chromatin was digested with ribonuclease 
A followed by proteinase K. Then the DNA was purified 
using spin columns. The size of the DNA was confirmed 
by a bioanalyzer (Agilent Biotechnologies, Savage, MD).
Next generation sequencing and ChIP-Seq 
analysis
The purified DNA library was sequenced using an 
Illumina HighSeq2000 at the Sanford-Burnham Medical 
Research Institute at Lake Nona, National Genome Library 
Core Facility. Sequenced regions were aligned to the 
reference human genome 19 using the Bowtie alignment 
program that utilizes an extended Burrows-Wheeler 
indexing for an ultrafast memory efficient alignment 
[60]. Peak calling utilized a model-based analysis of 
ChIP-Seq (MACS) algorithm [61, 62]. The overlap 
analysis, plot of genomic location, sequence extraction, 
motif identification, and peak filtering were performed 
using ChIPseek: a web-based analysis for ChIP data [63]. 
ChIPseek also employs scripts from BEDtools [64] using 
a genome binning algorithm used by the UCSC genome 
browser to sort genomic regions into groups along the 
length of chromosome [65]. Data visualization was carried 
out using the integrative genomics viewer [66].
Motif analysis based on position site-specific 
matrix models
Computational 
response 
element 
searching 
algorithms are able to estimate a sequence’s likelihood 
in belonging to the response element of the query 
transcription factor using position site-specific matrix 
(PSSM) models where each position in the query 
transcription factor model gives each of the four letters 
in the DNA alphabet a score based on the probability 
of that nucleotide being found at that position [67]. 
Summation into a logs-odd score is converted into a 
p-value assuming a zero-order background model, and 
all response elements less than the threshold are reported 
[68]. Motif discovery, motif enrichment, and motif 
scanning used the multiple expectation maximization 
for motif elicitation (MEME) and discriminative regular 
expression motif elicitation (DREME) suite software 
toolkits from a set of user supplied unaligned sequences 
for ChIP-Seq regions [69]. De novo motif analysis 
programs MEME and DREME identify frequently 
detected DNA sequences patterns and similarity matches 
of recurring ChIP-Seq sequences with DNA motifs

of deposited studies in genomic sequence databases 
[68, 70]. After a motif of interest is discovered the 
genomic sequences of the ChIP sequenced data is 
scanned using the MEME suite software find individual 
motif occurrences (FIMO) [68] for individual motif 
occurrences using PSSMs to compute a log-likelihood 
ratio score for each submitted sequence. Sequence-
specific matrix models are further used to analyze the 
next generation sequencing data for motif enrichment 
and potential coactivators [13, 71].
Microarray analysis
In order to quantify the transcriptomic effect 
of KDM3A or AR knockdown, a microarray profiling 
analysis was conducted on CWR22Rv1 knockdown 
cells. CWR22v1 cells were transduced with lentiviral 
pLKO.1 control shRNA vector, AR, or KDM3A shRNA 
for 48 h. Total RNA was isolated from cells, and 500 
ng was used for synthesis of biotin-labeled cRNA using 
an RNA amplification kit (Ambion, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, Waltham, MA). Biotinylated cRNA was 
labeled by incubation with streptavidin-Cy3 to generate 
a probe for hybridization with the GeneChip Human 
Transcriptome Array 2.0 (Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, 
CA) or the genome-wide transcriptome Human HT-
12 V4.0 (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA). Four samples 
from two experimental groups (n=2 per group) were 
hybridized to the chip to obtain raw gene expression 
data, which was processed to obtain raw data in the 
form of expression intensities. Raw data was then 
exported for further processing and analysis using R 
statistical software version 3.1 in combination with the 
BioConductor oligo, affy and genefilter packages [72]. 
The raw signal intensities were background corrected, 
LOG2 transformed, and quantile normalized to generate 
robust multi-array average (RMA) normalized intensities 
[73]. Quality control analyses did not reveal any outlier 
samples. Differential expression between experimental 
groups was assessed by generating relevant contrasts 
corresponding to the two-group comparison and was 
evaluated using the Linear Models for Microarray 
Analysis (LIMMA) package [72, 74]. Raw p-values 
were corrected for multiple hypotheses testing using the 
false discovery rate controlling procedure of Benjamini 
and Hochberg, and adjusted p-values below 0.05 were 
considered significant [75]. Genes with significantly 
altered expression levels with adjusted p-values below 
0.05 following KDM3A knockdown were selected and 
analyzed through the use of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 
(IPA, Qiagen, Redwood City, CA). Pathway enrichment 
of differentially expressed genes was determined by 
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) by pairing each 
gene with its expression value and ranking genes in 
descending order (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA) 
[76, 77]. As we are testing multiple gene sets at the 
same time, the p-values need to be controlled for false 
positives. The false discovery rate estimation for the 
pathway enrichment is as summarized in q-values with a 
threshold of 0.10 controlling the error rate and correcting 
for multiple hypotheses testing according to Benjamini 
and Hochberg [75]. Acquired data of transcriptome 
profiling microarray analysis of CWR22Rv1 cells with 
AR knockdown using GeneChip Human Transcriptome 
Array 2.0, platform GPL16686 (Affymetrix Inc, Santa 
Clara, CA), is deposited in the NCBI GEO database 
under accession number GSE86547. Acquired data 
of CWR22Rv1 cells with KDM3A knockdown using 
hybridization with genome-wide transcriptome Human 
HT-12 V4.0, platform GPL10558 (Illumina Inc, San 
Diego, CA), is deposited under accession number 
GSE70498.
