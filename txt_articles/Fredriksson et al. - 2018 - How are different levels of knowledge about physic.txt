Abstract
People with knowledge of the benefits of physical activity tend to be more active; however,
such knowledge is typically operationalized as a basic understanding that physical activity is
‘good’ for health. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether there are differ-
ences in how detailed a person’s knowledge is about the benefits of physical activity. Partici-
pants (N = 615) completed an online survey to measure their current physical activity
behaviour, as well as their level of knowledge of the benefits and risks of physical (in)activity.
The majority of participants (99.6%) strongly agreed that physical activity is good for health,
however on average, participants only identified 13.8 out of 22 diseases associated with
physical inactivity and over half of participants (55.6%) could not identify how much physical
activity is recommended for health benefits. Furthermore, 45% of the participants overesti-
mated, 9% underestimated and 27% did not know the increased risk of disease resulting
from inactivity as indicated by the Australian Department of Health. Participants were signifi-
cantly more active when they correctly identified more diseases associated with physical
inactivity and when they overestimated the risks associated with inactivity. Therefore, health
promotion initiatives should increase knowledge of the types of diseases associated with
inactivity. Low knowledge of physical activity guidelines suggest they should be promoted
more, as this knowledge provides guidance on frequency, types and duration of physical
activity needed for health.
Introduction
Regular physical activity reduces the risk of all-cause mortality by 30%, reduces the risk of
developing major chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease by 35%, type 2 diabetes by
42%, colon cancer by 30% and increases life expectancy by up to seven years [1,2]. Regular par-
ticipation in physical activity also improves general physical health and well-being [3]. The
Australian Department of Health recommends that Australian adults aged between 18–64
years engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week, or

 alternatively, in 75 minutes of vigorous intensity physical activity per week to increase the
prospect of experiencing the health benefits [3]. However, the 2014–2015 Australian Health
Survey suggested that only 56% of Australian adults are meeting these recommendations [4].
Social cognitive theories such as the theory of planned behaviour [5] and the health belief
model [6,7] suggest that knowing about the health implications of physical (in)activity
increases intentions to be regularly active. However, people’s general beliefs that physical activ-
ity is beneficial for health does not predict much variability in intentions or behaviour [8].
These previous null findings may be the result of the superficial operationalization of ‘knowl-
edge’ that is typically used in studies through one or two items (e.g., “Do you think physical
activity is beneficial or harmful?”) [8]. A more nuanced approach into understanding people’s
knowledge of physical activity benefits is needed before ruling out that knowledge is important
in influencing future activity behaviour.
Chapman and Liberman [9] proposed four different levels of knowledge regarding
smoking.
Briefly, level 1 knowledge is ‘having heard that smoking increases health risks’, level 2
knowledge is ‘being aware that specific diseases are caused by smoking’, level 3 knowledge is
‘accurately appreciating the severity and probabilities of developing tobacco-related diseases’,
and level 4 knowledge is ‘accepting that the risks inherent in levels 1–3 directly apply to one’s
own risk of developing such diseases’ [9]. These four levels of knowledge can also be applied to
physical activity, as outlined in Table 1.
Morrow et al. [10] examined the prevalence of different levels of knowledge regarding phys-
ical activity for health among U.S. adults (N = 2002, 62% female, 80% aged between 18–60
years). They found that the majority of people (94%) understand and believe that physical
activity is good for one’s overall health (i.e., Level 1 knowledge). However, only 70% of the par-
ticipants had more specific knowledge regarding the minimum days of physical activity per
week required to gain health benefits (i.e., Level 3 knowledge). Furthermore, less than 50% of
participants were aware of the U.S. physical activity recommendations of at least 150 minutes a
week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activ-
ity [10] Similar findings were reported by Bennett et al. [11] in U.S. adults (N = 2701, 52%
female, age M = 46 years) and Hui and Morrow [12] in Chinese adults (N = 812, 54% female,
90% aged between 18–60 years), where participants were found to have an overall poor under-
standing of physical activity’s role in disease prevention (i.e., Level 2 knowledge). Further, only
Table 1. Levels of knowledge regarding benefits and risks of physical (in)activity for health.
Level 1: Knowing that physical activity is beneficial for health and physical inactivity is harmful to health
At the most elementary level, one can ask whether an individual has ever heard that physical activity is beneficial for
health, and in turn, that physical inactivity poses risks to ‘health’ in its widest sense. People might simply be aware
that ‘being active is good for health’.
Level 2: Knowing that specific health conditions are related to physical inactivity
Level 2 knowledge involves knowing that a lack of physical activity can lead to particular diseases, such as
cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart attacks, strokes), type 2 diabetes, colon and breast cancer. Level 2 knowledge also
means knowing about the relationship between levels of activity and certain health risk factors, such as high blood
pressure and elevated cholesterol.
Level 3: Knowing exactly how much physical activity is needed for health, and the probabilities of developing
physical inactivity related health conditions
Knowledge of how much physical activity (frequency, duration, intensity) is needed to receive health benefits.
Furthermore, Level 3 knowledge involves an understanding of the magnitude of the health risks associated with
physical inactivity (e.g., 35% increase in CVD).
Level 4: Knowing and accepting that the risks and benefits of physical activity (inherent in levels 1–3) apply to
one’s own risk of developing such health conditions
Level 4 knowledge involves people agreeing and understanding that their physical (in)activity poses significant risks
or benefits to their own health.

 57% of the participants in the Chinese study could correctly identify appropriate physical
activity recommendations (i.e., Level 3 knowledge) [12]. To-date, only one study has investi-
gated different levels of physical activity knowledge in Australians [13]. This study examined
individual (miss)perceptions in relation to physical activity behaviour and health in 2535 Aus-
tralian adults. They found that 24% of individuals thought they were meeting the national
physical activity guidelines (i.e., Level 3 knowledge), when in fact they were not [13]. More-
over, 46% of the Australian adults who did not meet the physical activity guidelines overesti-
mated the health benefits they attributed to their insufficient level of physical activity
participation (i.e., Level 2 knowledge) [13]. More research is needed to develop a better under-
standing of the levels of physical activity knowledge and the relationship with physical activity
behaviour in Australian adults. A greater understanding of what type of knowledge is associ-
ated with physical activity behaviour will help inform the development of new or improved
effective health promotion interventions.
The aims of this study were to (1) identify different levels of knowledge regarding physical
activity for health in Australian adults, and (2) to examine the relationship between different
levels of physical activity knowledge and physical activity behaviour. It was hypothesised that
the majority of adults will have low levels of knowledge regarding the benefits and risks of
physical (in)activity for health beyond Level 1. Further, it is hypothesised that adults with
higher levels of knowledge regarding the benefits and risks of physical (in)activity for health
will be significantly more active than those with lower levels of knowledge.
Method
Participants and procedures
Overall, 615 Australian adults participated in the current study. The participants were
recruited online through invitations posted on Facebook and emailed to university students
and staff at Central Queensland University, as well as businesses listed in local directories in
Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia. Participants were eligible to
partake in the study if they were 18 years or older and currently residing in Australia. Respon-
dents were asked to complete the survey by clicking on a link which directed them to the Sur-
vey Monkey website (an online survey development cloud-based platform). Prior to starting
the survey, participants were provided with an online information sheet that outlined the
study aims, participants’ rights and the research team’s contact details should participants have
any questions or concerns regarding the study. Upon reading this information, participants
were given the option to commence participation of the study and were asked to provide
informed consent to participate in the study through ticking a box if they agreed to the terms
and conditions of the study. The participants then proceeded to start the survey which took
approximately 10–15 minutes to complete. The survey was divided into three separate sections
where the demographic questions, Active Australia Survey, and knowledge of benefits and
risks of physical (in)activity were each provided on a separate page. Ethical clearance for the
study was obtained from the Central Queensland University Human Ethics Committee in
May 2017 (H1704-063). The data collection methods met the terms of service for all websites
used as part of this research.
Measures
Demographics.
The survey included demographic questions regarding age, gender,
height and weight. The participants education was further assessed on three different levels,
including low levels of education (i.e., up to year 12; 17.6%), medium levels of education (i.e.,
trade certificate or diploma; 30.4%), and high levels of education (i.e., bachelor or post-

 graduate degrees; 52%). Furthermore, the survey included questions assessing level of urbani-
sation (major city, regional area, rural remote area), as well as current employment status
(employed/self-employed, part-time employed/part-time self-employed, and unemployed/
home duties/student/retired/pensioner).
Physical activity behaviour
Adults’ levels of physical activity were assessed using the Active Australia Survey [14]. The
Active Australia Survey consists of eight questions designed to measure walking activity, mod-
erate intensity activity (e.g., gentle swimming) and vigorous intensity activity (e.g., cycling).
For example, the domain ‘walking’ was assessed through two questions: 1) “In the last week,
how many times have you walked continuously, for at least 10 minutes, for recreation, exercise
or to get to or from places?” with the response being the amount of times and 2) “What do you
estimate was the total time that you spent walking in this way in the last week?”, with the
response being hours and minutes. Total physical activity was calculated by summing the time
spent walking, completing moderate physical activity and completing vigorous physical activ-
ity (the number of vigorous minutes was doubled to account for the additional health benefits)
according to manual instructions [14]. The Active Australia Survey has been found to have
good construct validity for moderate and vigorous activity (r = 0.86 and 0.95, respectively), as
well as excellent reliability (0.71 to 0.86, & Spearman’s Rho of 0.54 to 0.77) [14].
Levels of knowledge of physical activity for health
Knowledge questions pertaining to the impact of physical activity on health were based on
Chapman’s [9,15] questionnaire of levels of smoking knowledge. Level 1 knowledge was
assessed with the question, ‘In your opinion, is participating in regular physical activity benefi-
cial for people’s health? ‘Would you say that it is. . .’ (5 response options, from ‘not beneficial
at all’ to ‘very beneficial’ with higher scores indicating higher knowledge). Level 2 knowledge
was assessed through asking the participants to select which health conditions were a result of
physical inactivity from a list of options including correct responses such as ‘cardiovascular
disease’, ‘diabetes’ and incorrect responses such as ‘skin cancer’. Level 2 knowledge was calcu-
lated as a sum of how many health conditions they correctly identified as having benefit from
increased activity (from 0 to 21). Level 3 knowledge was split into two separate variables (a and
b). Level 3a was assessed through the use of a multiple choise question with 5 response options
of which only one was correct: ‘To the best of your knowledge, how much physical activity is
sufficient to achieve health benefits in adults? Do you think it is. . .’ with incorrect response
options such as ‘30 minutes of vigorous intensity physical activity on at least 2 days a week’
and a correct response option, ‘30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on 5 or
more days a week’. Level 3a knowledge was coded as a binary ‘correct’ or ‘incorrect.’ Level 3b
was assessed using four items asking ‘On a range of 0–100%, by what percentage do you think
participating in regular physical activity would reduce a person’s risk of developing cardiovas-
cular disease/colon cancer/depression/Type 2 diabetes?’ The participants chose values from a
dropdown box listing the values in ten percent increments (0%, 10%, 20% . . . 100%).
Responses were averaged across the 4 items and participants were coded into 1) do not know,
2) underestimate <27.5%, 3) correct >27.5% & <47.5%, and 4) overestimate >47.5%. These
cut offs were based on past research which demonstrate the increased risk of these diseases due
to inactivity to range from 30–45%, and allowing a 2.5% room for error either side [1,2]. Level
4 knowledge was assessed using four items: ‘In your opinion, would not participating in regular
physical activity increase your risk of developing cardiovascular disease/colon cancer/depres-
sion/Type 2 diabetes at some point during your lifetime?’ (5 response options, from ‘Yes, a

 very high risk’ to ‘no increased risk’). Responses were averaged to create a Level 4 knowledge
summary score (range of 1–5) with a higher score indicating a higher understanding of per-
sonal risk of inactivity.
Data analysis.
The prediction, that the majority of adults would have low levels of knowl-
edge regarding the benefits and risks of physical (in)activity for health beyond Levels 1 was
examined using descriptive statistics for each of the levels of knowledge. A generalized linear
model analysis (Tweedie with log link which is applicable to non-negative continuous data
that includes a mixture of zeros and positive values) was conducted to test whether adults with
higher levels of knowledge regarding the benefits and risks of physical (in)activity for health
would be significantly more active than those with lower levels of knowledge. The independent
variables were the four different levels of knowledge (level 2, level 3a, level 3b, level 4), and the
dependent variable was weekly minutes of physical activity behaviour. Age, gender and educa-
tion were included in the model as covariates.
Results
In total, 615 participants, 150 males (24.4%), 463 females (75.3%), and 2 individuals identifying
as ‘other’ (0.3%) participated in the online survey conducted between May and July 2017.
Table 2 presents participant demographics. The participants were between 18 and 77 years of
age (M = 43, SD = 13), with the majority (67%) of the participants residing in regional areas.
Participants were of various educational backgrounds including low levels of education
(17.6%), medium levels of education (30.4%), and high levels of education (52%). The majority
of participants were employed in full-time paid positions (43.9%), followed by people currently
not employed (28.6%), and individuals employed in part-time paid positions (27.5%). Only a
small percentage of people (0.4%) were found to not possess Level 1 knowledge. Therefore,
Level 1 knowledge was excluded from the general linear model testing associations between
levels of physical activity knowledge and physical (in)activity.
As seen in Table 2, levels of knowledge of benefits and risks of physical (in)activity were
much lower beyond Level 1. On average, participants were only able to correctly identify 13.8
(SD = 3.43) out of 22 diseases associated with physical inactivity (Level 2 knowledge), and with
a large portion of adults (55.6%) incorrectly identifying how much physical activity is needed
for health (Level 3a knowledge). The majority (80%) of participants failed to correctly identify
the probabilities of developing diseases if physical activity guidelines were not met. Specifically,
many participants overestimated the health impact of physical activity on diseases (44.7%),
whereas a much smaller percentage (8.8%) underestimated. On average, participants scored
3.3 out of 5 for Level 4 knowledge which demonstrates on average the belief of a moderate sus-
ceptibility to disease in their lifetime if they are inactive.
Table 3 shows the results of the model testing whether knowledge was associated with phys-
ical activity behaviour. Knowledge of disease risk of physical (in)activity (Level 2 knowledge)
was positively associated with time spent in physical activity (β = 1.03, p < .05). A significant
association was also found for Level 3b knowledge, such that participants who underestimated
the impact of inactivity on disease risk were less active compared to participants who overesti-
mated the risk (β = .67, p = < .05). No significant associations were found between Level 3a
knowledge (β = -1.06, p = .424), or Level 4 knowledge (β = 1.05, p = 294) and physical activity
behaviour.
Discussion
The present study aimed to take a more nuanced approach to understanding the degree to
which Australian adults understand the benefits and risks of physical (in)activity and whether

 different levels of knowledge is associated with physical activity behaviour. Previous evidence
[8] suggests that general knowledge of the health benefits of physical activity does not predict
behaviour well, despite the inclusion of this construct in prominent behaviour change theories.
Our evidence suggests this may be because most people only have a vague understanding of
the relationship between physical activity and health, and when a more nuanced approach to
understanding people’s knowledge is taken, the association to behaviour becomes clearer. As
such, the prediction that the majority of adults would have low levels of knowledge regarding
the benefits and risks of physical (in)activity beyond Level 1, was supported. This is similar to
results presented by Morrow et al. [10], who found that 94% of Americans participating in the
study had knowledge that physical activity is good for health (i.e., Level 1 knowledge), but at
higher knowledge levels, the percentage of participants with correct knowledge was much
lower.

 Furthermore, the prediction that adults with higher levels of knowledge would be signifi-
cantly more active than adults with lower levels of knowledge was confirmed for Level 2 and
3b knowledge. This is similar to the findings of Hui and Morrow [12] who suggested that par-
ticipants with lower levels of knowledge regarding diseases associated with physical (in)activity
were less likely to meet the physical activity guidelines. However, our results indicate that pro-
moting exact figures of increased risk of disease (i.e. 30–40% increased risk of cardiovascular
disease, diabetes and some cancers) is unlikely to increase physical activity behaviour, because
individuals who overestimated the decrease in health risk from being active were significantly
more active than those who underestimated the risk. It may even negatively impact the physi-
cal activity behaviour of those who currently overestimate the disease risk reduction of physical
activity. Health promotion efforts may be more successful if they promote a greater awareness
of the entire range of diseases associated with physical (in)activity (Level 2 knowledge) as this
is positively associated with physical activity levels. This finding indicates that health care pro-
fessionals and campaign directors could benefit from emphasizing more on information
regarding specific health conditions related to physical inactivity in health promotion
materials.
No significant relationship was found between Level 3a knowledge and physical activity
behaviour. Many physical activity promotion messages in Australia focus on the dissemination
of the national physical activity guidelines recommended for good health (Level 3a knowl-
edge), however our research demonstrates that this knowledge is not associated with physical
activity behaviour. This finding differs from those reported by Plotnikoff et al. [16] who found
that Canadian adults’ knowledge of specific physical activity recommendations was higher
among those who are more active.
Also, no significant relationship was found between Level 4 knowledge and physical activity
behaviour. One potential explanation for this lack of association is that the participants who
correctly identified Level 4 knowledge may believe that inactivity will lead to an increased risk
of disease for them, however as this risk may not be perceived as urgent they may not see a rea-
son to be active early on. Hall and Fong’s [17] temporal self-regulation theory suggests that
people’s willingness to perform a health behaviour is partially determined by how soon they
anticipate outcomes (such as health consequences) to occur. Therefore, future research should
consider incorporating perceived time to risk outcome into investigations of the link between
physical activity behaviour and knowledge of risk/benefits.

 Strengths and limitations
The current study has several strengths, particularly the large sample, as well as a great diver-
sity among participants in terms of employment, age, and urbanisation. Furthermore, to the
authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to have examined how different levels of knowledge
regarding the benefits and risks of physical (in)activity are associated with physical activity
behaviours in an Australian population. The median age of the sample was 43 years, 82% of
adults had more than 12 years education and 71% were in paid employment which is relatively
respresentative of the general Australian population (38 years, 62% and 88%, respectively)
[18,19]. However, our sample included 75% females and 30% living in a city as opposed to
51% females and 67% living in a city among the general Australian population [18,19].
While the study had several strengths, there are a some limitations that warrant attention.
One limitation of the current study is the overrepresentation of women, with 75% of the sam-
ple consisting of female participants. The findings may therefore not generalise to males. Due
to the anonymity and format of the online survey, controlling the percentage of males and
females proved difficult. For future research it is suggested that measures are taken to assure a
more equal distribution of gender in the sample. This could for example be achieved by con-
ducting a telephone survey similar to the study conducted by Morrow et al. [10]. Another limi-
tation of the current study is the reliance on self-report measures for assessing physical activity
levels, as recall and social desirability bias may influence the truthfulness of the answers [20,
21]. While the anonymity of the survey minimises this issue, future research may still consider
an objective measure for physical activity, such as accelerometers [22]. Furthermore, the physi-
cal activity knowledge questions were newly developed based on the four different levels of
knowledge regarding smoking proposed by Chapman and Liberman [9], however, their psy-
chometric properties are unknown. Finally, the cross-sectional design of the current study pre-
cludes inference on causal relationships and identification of changes in physical activity
knowledge over time as predictor of physical activity behaviour. The latter would be worth
exploring in future longitudinal studies.
Conclusion
The results of the current study provides useful insight into how the different levels of physical
activity knowledge are associated with physical activity behaviour. The study supported previ-
ous findings of limited knowledge in adult populations beyond a basic understanding that
physical activity is good for health, in an Australian population. Findings demonstrated an
association between knowledge of diseases associated with inactivity and physical activity and
that participants who overestimated the increased risk of disease from inactivity were more
active than those who underestimated. It is recommended that physical activity interventions
and health promotion initiatives improve knowledge of types of diseases associated with inac-
tivity. However, improved knowledge of the exact increased risk of disease from inactivity,
knowledge of the physical activity guidelines and an understanding that inactivity increases
one’s own risk of disease is unlikely to have any significant effect on physical activity levels.
