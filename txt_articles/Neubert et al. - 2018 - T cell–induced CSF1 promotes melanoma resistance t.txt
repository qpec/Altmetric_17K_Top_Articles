Abstract
Colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) is a key regulator of monocyte/macrophage differentiation that 
sustains the protumorigenic functions of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We show that 
CSF1 is expressed in human melanoma, and patients with metastatic melanoma have increased 
CSF1 in blood compared to healthy subjects. In tumors, CSF1 expression correlated with the

 abundance of CD8+ T cells and CD163+ TAMs. Human melanoma cell lines consistently 
produced CSF1 after exposure to melanoma-specific CD8+ T cells or T cell–derived cytokines in 
vitro, reflecting a broadly conserved mechanism of CSF1 induction by activated CD8+ T cells. 
Mining of publicly available transcriptomic data sets suggested co-enrichment of CD8+ T cells 
with CSF1 or various TAM-specific markers in human melanoma, which was associated with 
nonresponsiveness to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) checkpoint blockade in a smaller 
patient cohort. Combination of anti-PD1 and anti–CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) antibodies induced the 
regression of BRAFV600E-driven, transplant mouse melanomas, a result that was dependent on the 
effective elimination of TAMs. Collectively, these data implicate CSF1 induction as a CD8+ T 
cell–dependent adaptive resistance mechanism and show that simultaneous CSF1R targeting may 
be beneficial in melanomas refractory to immune checkpoint blockade and, possibly, other T cell–
based therapies.
INTRODUCTION
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) frequently make up a substantial proportion of all 
tumor-infiltrating immune cells. TAMs play complex immunological roles in the tumor 
microenvironment, which vary with their activation state (1, 2). Although a spectrum of 
TAM phenotypes likely exists in tumors, two opposing phenotypes, denoted classically 
activated (or M1-like) and alternatively activated (or M2-like), have been associated with 
anti- and protumoral functions, respectively (3–5). Progressing tumors typically display M2-
like TAM activation in response to various tumor-derived factors (1, 2). M2-polarized TAMs 
facilitate angiogenesis, cancer cell invasion, and metastasis and may also suppress T cells 
(6–8). Conversely, there is evidence for M1-like TAMs engaging tumor-antagonizing 
functions, and their presence and roles in tumors have been primarily characterized in the 
context of anticancer therapies or gene-targeting studies (9, 10). Although abundant TAM 
infiltrates generally associate with poor clinical outcome in most cancer types (11–13), some 
studies have also shown that M1-like TAMs may correlate positively with patient survival 
(13, 14). Macrophages make up a significant, albeit variable, proportion of the immune cell 
infiltrate in human melanoma (2), but their significance for clinical outcome remains 
unclear. Although several studies showed that macrophage abundance correlates with 
melanoma thickness (15–19), only one study (18) out of six examined (15–20) suggested 
that TAMs may correlate with poor overall survival in patients with malignant melanoma.
Colony-stimulating factor 1 [CSF1; also known as macrophage colony-stimulating factor 
(M-CSF)] controls proliferation, differentiation, and survival of macrophages from their 
precursors (21, 22). CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling in TAMs may promote their 
acquisition of an immunosuppressive and protumorigenic, M2-like phenotype (10, 23, 24). 
For example, expression of CSF1 is associated with poor prognosis in tumors of the 
reproductive system, such as ovarian, uterine, breast, and prostate cancers (25, 26). 
Accordingly, preclinical studies have shown that CSF1R blockade may delay tumor growth 
in some mouse cancer models through the elimination or repolarization of TAMs (9, 10, 27–
32). Two phase 1 clinical trials documented objective clinical responses after CSF1R 
blockade in patients with diffuse-type tenosynovial giant cell tumors, a degenerative 
condition sustained by proliferating macrophages (31–33). However, single-agent CSF1R

 blockade had limited activity in Hodgkin lymphoma (34, 35) and provided no benefits in 
glioblastoma (36), according to phase 2 and 2/3 clinical trials.
In recent years, antibodies targeting immune inhibitory receptors (“checkpoints”) have 
markedly improved the clinical outcome of patients with advanced melanoma. The U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first anti–cytotoxic T lymphocyte–
associated protein 4 (CTLA4) antibody, ipilimumab, in 2011, followed by two programmed 
cell death protein 1 (PD1)–specific antibodies, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, in 2014 (37). 
Three programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1)–specific antibodies—atezolizumab, durvalumab, 
and avelumab—have also been approved by the FDA (38, 39). The response to anti-PD1 
therapy may correlate with prognostic baseline markers, such as expression of PDL1 in the 
tumors, high intratumoral T cell infiltration, or the abundance of tumor-specific T cells (40, 
41). However, clinical responses are not always associated with these prognostic biomarkers, 
suggesting that additional mechanisms may hamper effective T cell responses in melanoma.
Generally, immune checkpoint blockade aims to support the activation of antitumor T cells 
(42). Two major cytokines secreted by activated CD8+ T cells are interferon-γ (IFNγ) and 
tumor necrosis factor–α (TNFα), which are both known to induce CSF1 expression in 
various cell types of the tumor microenvironment (43). This raises the possibility that a 
feedback mechanism conducive to T cell suppression may be instigated by T cells through 
CSF1 induction and the recruitment or activation of immunosuppressive and protumoral 
TAMs. Here, we show that CSF1 expression by melanoma cells may limit immune attack by 
activated, IFNγ-secreting CD8+ T cells in patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma. 
Our results support the notion that concomitant blockade of the CSF1/CSF1R pathway may 
improve intratumoral CD8+ T cell function and melanoma treatment with immune 
checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD1- or PDL1-blocking antibodies. Although monotherapy 
with CSF1R inhibitors may have limited clinical efficacy (34, 35), its combination with 
immune checkpoint blockade has the potential to provide clinical benefits to patients with 
melanoma and, possibly, other cancer types.
RESULTS
Melanoma progression is associated with increased CSF1 concentration in peripheral 
blood
We measured CSF1 in the blood of 12 healthy individuals and 15 patients with distant 
metastases (stage IV) or locally advanced (stage III) cutaneous melanoma (table S1), staged 
according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer. CSF1 was significantly increased (P 
< 0.0001) in melanoma patients, suggesting that CSF1 production is tumor-induced (Fig. 
1A). A positive correlation was observed between CSF1 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a 
biomarker of disease burden (44), in the blood of the patients (Fig. 1B). In addition, analysis 
of a larger patient cohort (n = 40) showed higher concentration of blood CSF1 in patients at 
stage IV compared to stage IIIB (Fig. 1C). These findings indicate that CSF1 production is 
elevated in patients with melanoma and increases with disease progression.

 Melanoma infiltration by CD8+ T cells correlates with enrichment of CSF1+, CSF1R+, and 
CD163+ cells
To determine whether the expression of CSF1 is associated with the abundance of CSF1R+ 
macrophages in human melanoma, we examined CSF1 and CSF1R expression by 
chromogenic immunohistochemistry (IHC). In both primary tumors and cutaneous 
metastases (table S1), the expression of CSF1 correlated with that of CSF1R (Fig. 2A), 
suggesting a relationship between CSF1 production and TAM abundance.
CSF1 may promote T cell suppression by expanding immunosuppressive TAMs (45). To test 
this hypothesis, we quantified the expression of CD8, CSF1, CSF1R, and the M2 marker 
CD163 on histological sections of primary tumors and cutaneous metastases. Tumor regions 
with high density of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells were also enriched in CSF1+ cells and 
CSF1R+ or CD163+ TAMs, whereas tumor regions with scant CD8+ T cell infiltrates 
displayed poor TAM infiltration (fig. S1 and Fig. 2, B and C). We observed these 
correlations in patients with either high or low CD8+ T cell infiltration in their tumors (Fig. 
2D). We next examined whether the correlations between CD8+ T cells and TAMs that we 
observed in our patient cohort could be confirmed in an independent, larger patient cohort. 
Transcriptomic data of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) of The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) (46) showed that, in metastatic tumors, the expression of CD8A and CD8B strongly 
correlated with the expression of CSF1, CSF1R, CD68, and CD163 (Fig. 2E), but not with 
the melanoma-specific marker genes MIA (melanoma inhibitory activity) and TYR 
(tyrosinase), which we analyzed as “housekeeping” controls (fig. S2). Together, these results 
strongly argue that the abundance of CD8+ T cells positively correlates with TAM 
infiltration in human cutaneous melanoma.
Tumor cells are a source of CSF1 in human melanoma
We then asked whether melanoma cells could be a source of CSF1 in the tumors. We 
performed multiplexed immunofluorescence staining on histological sections of eight 
melanoma specimens (table S1). Melanoma cells were identified by their expression of the 
S100 protein, which is the most sensitive diagnostic marker for melanoma cells (47). We 
found that about 80% of the S100+ melanoma cells expressed CSF1 (Fig. 3, A and B). We 
then reassessed CSF1 expression in relation to CD8+ T cell abundance and found that it was 
higher in tumor regions with high than low CD8+ T cell density (fig. S3, A to C), which 
confirmed the IHC data (Fig. 2, C and D).
Melanoma-specific CTLs trigger CSF1 production by melanoma cells
To evaluate whether melanoma cells constitutively secrete CSF1, we tested four low-passage 
human melanoma cell lines for their ability to produce CSF1 (Fig. 4A). Although CSF1 was 
low or undetectable in medium conditioned by untreated melanoma cell cultures, it was 
induced by coculturing the melanoma cell lines with melanoma-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T 
lymphocyte (CTL) clones (Fig. 4B) (48). The CTLs were specific for human leukocyte 
antigen–A2 (HLA-A2)/MelanA/MART-1 (hereafter MelanA), and all four melanoma cell 
lines were positive for both HLA-A2 and MelanA (48, 49). Two of the four CTL-melanoma 
cocultures were autologous (T1185B and T1015A), whereas the other two (Me275 and 
Me290) were matched for HLA-A2. Notably, HLA-A2–restricted CTLs with irrelevant

 specificity (yellow fever virus–specific CTLs) did not trigger CSF1 secretion by melanoma 
cells.
We then analyzed intracellular CSF1 expression in the Me275 melanoma cell line by flow 
cytometry. Intracellular CSF1 increased in the melanoma cells after encounter with 
melanoma-specific CTLs (fig. S4A). Intracellular CSF1 was also increased in CTLs 
cocultured with antigen-expressing melanoma cells (fig. S4A). Together, these data support 
the notion that melanoma-specific CD8+ T cells stimulate CSF1 expression in human 
melanoma.
To assess whether the induction of CSF1 secretion was dependent on direct contacts 
between CTLs and melanoma cells, we performed distinct cell culture assays. Two different 
melanoma cell lines (Me290 and Me275) up-regulated CSF1 expression in the presence of 
activated MelanA-specific CTLs, both in direct contact (coculture) and in a transwell assay 
enabling the passage of soluble factors but not cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Nonspecific CTLs 
failed to induce CSF1 in either cell culture assay. Thus, CTLs that have been activated 
through antigen-specific interaction can induce CSF1 expression in neighboring melanoma 
cells without the requirement of further direct cell contacts.
We then asked whether CTL-derived soluble factors induce CSF1 production in melanoma 
cells. To this aim, we cultured human melanoma cell lines in the presence of combinations 
of IFNγ and TNFα, which are cytokines prominently secreted by activated CTLs (50). The 
two cytokines induced CSF1 secretion from the melanoma cell lines in the absence of 
melanoma-specific CTLs (Fig. 4E). Although CSF1 was induced by either IFNγ or TNFα 
alone, the combination of the two cytokines had the strongest effects. Fifteen additional 
melanoma cell lines were tested and found to secrete only low amounts of CSF1 in the 
absence of cytokines, but stimulation with IFNγ and TNFα strongly increased CSF1 
secretion in all cell lines (fig. S4B and table S2). In addition, blockade of IFNγ and TNFα 
during coculture attenuated the expression and secretion of CSF1 by melanoma cells (fig. 
S4, C and D). CSF1 mRNA expression was strongly increased in all four examined cell lines 
within 24 hours of coculture with melanoma-specific CTLs or stimulation with IFNγ and 
TNFα, but not in the presence of CTLs with irrelevant specificity (Fig. 4F), confirming the 
rapid and strong transcriptional up-regulation of CSF1 in melanoma cells. A 72-hour kinetic 
analysis of melanoma–T cell cocultures revealed a peak of IFNγ concentration at 24 hours, 
which coincided with the onset of CSF1 protein in the cell culture supernatant (Fig. 4, G and 
H). Finally, to explore the potential occurrence of autocrine signaling, we analyzed CSF1R 
expression in melanoma cells either unstimulated or exposed to IFNγ and TNFα but found 
no detectable CSF1R expression on melanoma cells (fig. S5). Together, these data identify 
IFNγ and TNFα as CTL-derived factors that induce CSF1 expression in melanoma cells.
We next examined the expression of CSF1, IFNG, and TNF in the metastatic cohort of 
TCGA melanoma data set (46). We found significant correlations (P < 0.001) between the 
expression of the three genes in cutaneous melanoma samples (Fig. 4I). The finding that 
CTL-derived cytokines promote CSF1 secretion is consistent with our previous study 
showing that, upon encountering melanoma-specific CTLs, melanoma cells activate a 
number of immune cell genes (49), some of which have been implicated in resistance to

 immunotherapy (51–54). Motivated by these earlier findings, we analyzed the expression of 
additional factors that may support immunosuppressive macrophage recruitment and found 
that melanoma cells also up-regulated TGFB, IL10, VEGFA, and VEGFC upon coculture 
with MelanA-specific CTLs or after exposure to IFNγ and TNFα (fig. S6).
Markers of CD8+ T cells and TAMs correlate with response to PD1 blockade in human 
melanoma
To further explore the associations between CTLs and TAMs in human melanoma, we 
analyzed the expression of CD8A and a compendium of macrophage-specific genes, 
previously identified in metastatic melanomas through single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-
seq) (55), in the SKCM metastatic cohort of TCGA (46). Compared to tumors with low 
CD8A expression, tumors with high CD8A expression were highly enriched for the 
macrophage signature (mean fold change > 2; P < 0.001) (Fig. 5A and table S3).
To explore the clinical significance of the CTL-TAM interplay, we examined the expression 
of CSF1, CSF1R, CD163, and CD68 in pretreatment tumor biopsies of metastatic melanoma 
patients stratified into responders and nonresponders after anti-PD1 therapy (56). The 
overall expression of the selected genes was not different between responders and 
nonresponders (fig. S7). However, further stratifying tumors based on CD8A expression 
revealed that, unlike the responders, the nonresponders showed an association between high 
CD8A expression and high expression of CSF1, CSF1R, and CD163 (Fig. 5B). To evaluate 
the impact of CTL and TAM infiltrates on melanoma prognosis, we analyzed CD8A and 
CSF1R expression and overall patient survival in the SKCM metastatic cohort (46). We 
found that a high CD8A/CSF1R ratio—a surrogate for the relative abundance of CD8+ T 
cells over TAMs—correlated with improved overall survival (P < 0.01; Fig. 5C). We 
obtained similar results by using alternative markers for both CD8+ T cells (GZMA and 
PRF1) and TAMs (CD68 and CD163) (fig. S8), which indicates that the observed 
correlations are cell type–specific and valid beyond single markers. Collectively, these 
findings support the notion that CTLs may drive the recruitment of immunosuppressive 
macrophages to human melanoma. Moreover, they suggest that TAM recruitment by 
activated CTLs may contribute to limit a potentially more robust antitumor immune response 
in the patients.
CSF1R inhibition enhances the therapeutic efficacy of PD1 blockade in BRAFV600E-driven 
transplant melanoma models
The results described above prompted us to investigate whether TAMs may limit melanoma 
response to immune checkpoint blockade. We used ovalbumin (OVA)–expressing SM1 cells 
(SM1-OVA), a mutant BRAFV600E-driven mouse melanoma cell line (57) that secretes high 
amounts of CSF1 (fig. S9). When inoculated in syngeneic C57Bl/6 mice, SM1 cells 
establish macrophage-rich tumors (27). We found that combined CSF1R and PD1 blockade 
improved tumor growth inhibition compared to the single agents (Fig. 6, A to C). Dual 
CSF1R and PD1 blockade induced complete regression of all tumors by 17 days after tumor 
challenge. Notably, single CSF1R blockade only slightly delayed tumor growth, whereas 
single PD1 blockade induced tumor regression in several, but not all, mice and with delayed 
kinetics compared to the combined treatment.

 Flow cytometric analysis of the tumors showed a significant reduction of MRC1+ (M2-like) 
TAMs (9) after anti-CSF1R treatment (Fig. 6D) and a significant increase of both CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells in the spleens of mice treated with anti-PD1 or combined anti-PD1 and anti-
CSF1R antibodies (Fig. 6E). Accordingly, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) 
analysis of tumor samples revealed decreased expression of Mrc1 (CD206) and Adgre1 
(F4/80), indicative of macrophage elimination, and elevated expression of Ifng, after CSF1R 
blockade (Fig. 6F). Six mice in the anti-PD1 plus anti-CSF1R treatment cohort were 
monitored for six additional weeks after the termination of the treatment and remained 
tumor-free.
We then used another transplant melanoma model, Yummer1.7, which does not express the 
highly immunogenic OVA protein but has been subject to subsequent rounds of ultraviolet 
irradiation to induce de novo mutations (58) that better recapitulate the high mutational load 
of human melanoma (46). Yummer1.7 cells express CSF1 constitutively (fig. S9). Anti-PD1 
treatment inhibited Yummer1.7 tumor growth in most of the mice (Fig. 6G) but did not 
extend survival after therapy withdrawal (Fig. 6H). Similar to findings in the SM1-OVA 
model, CSF1R blockade had no growth-inhibitory activity in the Yummer1.7 model, 
although both M2-like MRC1+ TAMs and total F4/80+ TAMs were markedly decreased 
upon treatment (Fig. 6I). Remarkably, the combination of anti-CSF1R and anti-PD1 
antibodies fully eradicated most of the tumors and greatly extended mouse survival after 
therapy, indicating strongly additive therapeutic effects of the two antibodies.
Finally, we generated a transgenic melanoma model, called iBIP2 (see Supplementary 
Materials and Methods), which is driven by tamoxifen- and doxycycline-inducible Cdkn2a 
and Pten deletion and BRAFV600 expression in skin melanocytes. iBIP2 transgenic mice 
were obtained by refining the existing iBIP melanoma model, which carries constitutively 
deleted Cdkn2a alleles, floxed Pten alleles, and inducible BRAFV600 expression (59). At 
variance with results obtained with transplant tumor models, combined CSF1R and PD1 
blockade did not inhibit melanoma growth in iBIP2 transgenic mice (Fig. 7A). Notably, anti-
CSF1R antibodies failed to deplete protumorigenic macrophages in the transgenic 
melanomas, as shown by both flow cytometry (Fig. 7B) and qPCR analysis of macrophage-
specific genes (Fig. 7C). These findings suggest that transgenic iBIP2 melanomas are 
refractory to TAM elimination and/or repolarization by anti-CSF1R antibodies, which may 
explain the lack of therapeutic responses.
Flow cytometric analysis of immunoglobulin G (IgG) control-treated iBIP2 and SM1-OVA 
tumors showed that iBIP2 tumors contained more abundant CD45+ hematopoietic cell 
infiltrates (Fig. 7D). Myeloid cells encompassing F4/80+ TAMs, Ly6C+ monocytes/
monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mo-MDSCs), and Ly6G+ neutrophils/
granulocytic MDSCs (gr-MDSCs) were all more abundant in iBIP2 compared to SM1-OVA 
tumors. Conversely, nonmyeloid (CD11b−) cells, which comprise lymphocytes and natural 
killer cells, were less abundant in the iBIP2 tumors. qPCR analysis of chemokine and 
cytokine genes involved in myeloid cell recruitment and activation (Fig. 7E) showed greatly 
enhanced expression of Ccl2, Il4, and Cxcl12 in iBIP2 compared to both SM1-OVA and 
Yummer1.7 tumors. It is possible that the cytokine networks active in iBIP2 melanomas may

 sustain tumor refractoriness to anti-CSF1R–mediated macrophage elimination and drive 
resistance to combined CSF1R and PD1 blockade.
DISCUSSION
This study suggests that adaptive CSF1 secretion upon exposure to T cell–derived cytokines 
may act detrimentally to recruit TAMs and consequently hamper antitumor immune 
responses. We observed elevated CSF1 in patients with advanced malignant melanoma, and 
CSF1 expression correlated with disease progression. Histological analysis of biopsies of 
primary and metastatic melanomas, as well as transcriptomic analysis of metastatic 
melanomas from TCGA (46), revealed a positive correlation between CD8A and CSF1 or 
the macrophage markers CSF1R and CD163. High CD8A was associated with higher 
CSF1R, CD68, and CD163 gene expression in pretreatment melanomas from patients who 
did not respond to anti-PD1 therapy (56). Accordingly, IFNγ and TNFα secreted by 
activated tumor-specific T cells induced melanoma cells to secrete CSF1 in vitro. Finally, 
mouse experiments using transplant melanoma models showed that combined PD1 and 
CSF1R blockade could eradicate the tumors.
Tumor resistance to targeted therapies is frequently due to selection of resistant cancer cell 
clones. Although this principle has been broadly demonstrated for therapies targeting 
oncogenes (60), the mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapies are diverse and not yet 
fully understood. Resistance can also develop in the absence of therapeutic pressure, for 
example, through evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that slow down or halt T cell 
responses after acute immune responses to avoid overwhelming tissue destruction (49). 
These conserved mechanisms have been referred to as adaptive immune resistance (40, 51–
53). The best-studied example of adaptive resistance is the well-known immune checkpoint 
PDL1-PD1 axis (54). PDL1 is one of the ligands for the immune checkpoint inhibitory 
molecule PD1, which is expressed on activated T cells. The induction of PDL1 on cancer 
cells and tumor-associated stromal cells was shown to be directly mediated by IFNγ 
signaling (51), one of the main cytokines secreted by activated CD8+ T and CD4+ helper 1 T 
cells. IFNγ can thus exert opposing roles in tumors. On the one hand, it ensues from the 
activation of T cells and can counteract tumor progression. On the other hand, it can 
indirectly suppress activated T cells through the up-regulation of immune inhibitors in the 
tumor microenvironment, such as PDL1 or indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), 
through a negative feedback mechanism (61, 62). Accordingly, the treatment of cancer 
patients with IFNγ has not yielded positive results (63–65).
Our patient data suggest that CSF1 induction in melanoma represents a conserved, adaptive 
resistance mechanism triggered by activated (IFNγ- and TNFα-secreting) T cells, which 
correlates with disease progression. In line with our findings, Varney et al. (66) previously 
reported augmented CSF1 mRNA in melanoma thicker than 0.75 mm. CSF1 is known to 
play a key role in shaping the tumor myeloid cell compartment toward immunosuppression 
by inducing the differentiation and accumulation of M2-like TAMs and MDSCs (3–5, 31). 
For example, infiltrating CD68+ or CD163+ TAMs correlated with poor outcome in solid 
tumors, such as breast and pancreatic cancers (67–69). Although CSF1R blockade provided 
limited therapeutic benefits, if any, in most of the cancer types tested so far (22, 34–36),

 preclinical mouse studies of breast, lung, and pancreatic tumors, and melanoma, suggest that 
its combination with other cancer immunotherapies, such as adoptive T cell transfer and 
checkpoint blockade (27, 29, 70), might improve clinical responses by relieving cancer-
associated immunosuppression (71). Here, combined PD1 and CSF1R blockade induced 
complete tumor regressions in two transplant BRAFV600E-driven melanoma models (SM1-
OVA and Yummer1.7). In both models, the anti-CSF1R antibody AFS98 (72) efficiently 
depleted TAMs. Conversely, dual CSF1R and PD1 blockade did not impair tumor growth in 
an inducible, BRAFV600E-driven transgenic melanoma model. In this experimental setup, 
antibody-mediated CSF1R blockade by the CSF1R antibody 2G2 (9, 31) neither eliminated 
TAMs nor altered their polarization, which may explain the lack of therapeutic benefit. 
Notably, 2G2 is a potent TAM-depleting agent, as shown previously in both transplant and 
transgenic cancer models (9, 31, 73). Failure of 2G2 to deplete TAMs in the iBIP2 model 
was associated with higher pretreatment expression of Ccl2, Il4, and Cxcl12, as well as 
infiltration by monocytic and granulocytic myeloid cells, compared to both SM1-OVA and 
Yummer1.7 models. Notably, elevated interleukin-4 (IL-4) expression may sustain TAM 
survival under emactuzumab (an anti-human CSF1R antibody), as shown in a recent clinical 
study (74). Furthermore, both CCL2 and CXCL12 are potent monocyte chemoattractants (1, 
3, 6–8), which may enhance monocyte-derived TAM turnover in the presence of CSF1R 
inhibition.
Earlier studies have shown that the combination of a CSF1R small-molecule inhibitor 
(PLX3397) and adoptive T cell transfer prolonged mouse survival compared to the single 
treatments in the BRAFV600E-driven SM1 and SM1-OVA mouse models in a T cell–
dependent manner (27). In another study, melanoma-bearing mice were treated with a BRAF 
inhibitor (PLX4720), a CSF1R inhibitor (PLX3397), and anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 antibodies 
(75). The triple combination delayed tumor growth compared to dual BRAF and CSF1R 
inhibition, although the growth delay achieved by the combination of PD1 or PDL1 
blockade and the CSF1R inhibitor was smaller than in our study. Differences in the 
therapeutic agents and dosage regimens may underlie the differences between earlier works 
and our study (27, 75). We used CSF1R antibodies (clones AFS98 and 2G2) that are specific 
for the ligand-binding domain of CSF1R and do not bind other tyrosine kinase receptors (31, 
72). Conversely, PLX3397 inhibits several kinases, including CSF1R [IC50 (median 
inhibitory concentration), 0.02 μM], cKIT (IC50, 0.01 μM), and FLT3 (IC50, 0.16 μM), so it 
may have broader effects than CSF1R antibodies on the immune tumor microenvironment 
(67). cKIT (CD117) is expressed by immature progenitor cells (72, 76), so PLX3397 may 
intervene at more upstream stages of myelopoiesis than AFS98. PLX3397 also suppresses 
extramedullary hematopoiesis by inhibiting the expansion of splenic myeloid precursors, 
granulocytes, monocytes, and macrophages, as shown in mice (77). Different modes of 
CSF1R inhibition, for example, by monoclonal antibodies versus kinase inhibitors with a 
broader spectrum of molecular targets, may induce tumor responses that vary with the 
cancer type and patient population (78).
Tumor responses to immunotherapy are generally heterogeneous and can be influenced by 
various parameters, including tumor type and the extent of immune cell infiltration, among 
other factors (79). The CTL-TAM molecular cross-talk identified in our study may help to 
predict clinical responses to PD1 or PDL1 blockade. Several genomic and transcriptomic

 markers of response or resistance to PD1/PDL1 blockade have been proposed (41, 56, 80–
85). Our analysis of the Hugo et al. data set (56) revealed that, unlike responders to anti-PD1 
therapy, nonresponders showed increased expression of CSF1, CSF1R, CD163, and CD68 in 
CD8AHigh tumors compared to CD8ALow tumors, pointing to higher protumoral 
macrophage infiltrates in the nonresponders. This is in line with previous studies showing a 
higher proximity of CD68+ myeloid cells to CD8+ T cells in nonresponders after PD1 
blockade (84). Therefore, combined macrophage elimination and immune checkpoint 
blockade may improve clinical outcomes in melanoma patients who do not respond to 
immune checkpoint blockade and, possibly, other T cell–based therapies.
Our study also has limitations that should be addressed with further work. Although we 
focused on CSF1, additional factors, such as transforming growth factor β (TGFB), IL-10, 
vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), and VEGFC, may be induced by CD8+ T 
cells (49) and contribute to recruit or polarize immunosuppressive macrophages in 
melanoma. Therefore, the relative contribution of CSF1 versus other factors to recruiting or 
activating immunosuppressive TAMs remains to be studied. Another unresolved issue is the 
discrepancy between therapeutic responses in transplant and transgenic melanoma models. It 
is currently unknown whether transgenic iBIP2 melanomas recapitulate more accurately 
than transplant melanoma models the cellular and molecular milieu of human melanoma. It 
is also possible that distinct patient subsets present biological features in their tumors that 
approximate either melanoma model. Ongoing clinical trials, such as those referenced in 
table S4, are expected to provide useful information on the potential of combined CSF1R 
and immune checkpoint blockade in patients with solid cancers. Several clinical trials 
involve patients enrolled for combination therapies of CSF1R kinase inhibitors (PLX3397, 
ARRY-382, and BLZ945) and anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 antibodies (NCT02777710, 
NCT02452424, NCT02880371, and NCT02829723). In further trials, patients with solid 
tumors are being treated with anti-CSF1R antibodies (RG7155, FPA008, and AMG820) in 
combination with PD1, PDL1, or CTLA4 blockade (NCT02323191, NCT02526017, 
NCT02713529, and NCT02718911). Notably, an anti-CSF1 antibody is also being tested in 
combination with PD1 blockade (NCT02807844). On the basis of current evidence, our data 
would encourage the stratification of patients for treatment with CSF1R inhibitors with PD1 
or PDL1 blockade based on T cell infiltration, IFNγ-regulated gene signatures, and 
abundance of M2-like TAMs in the tumor microenvironment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The patients analyzed in this study were diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma and gave 
informed consent before study inclusion. Patient studies and human sample collection were 
performed according to protocols (188/12 and 400/11) approved by the Institutional Review 
and Privacy Board of the University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland) 
and the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Canton de Vaud (Switzerland). The 
patient characteristics are described in table S1.
Studies involving large and independent experimental cohorts of mice were performed once. 
Mice with transplant or transgenic melanoma were randomized to the various experimental

 cohorts by excluding mice that lacked palpable tumors at the time of enrollment. The 
treatment of mice carrying transplant tumors was begun when the tumors had reached a size 
of about 50 mm3, whereas treatment of iBIP2 mice was begun when the tumors had reached 
a size of 50 to 100 mm3. All mouse cohorts received antibody injections at the dosage 
regimens indicated in Supplementary Materials and Methods. The investigators were not 
blinded when they administered therapeutic antibodies or while assessing the results of the 
experiments. All procedures involving transplant tumor models were performed according to 
a protocol approved by the Veterinary Authorities of the Canton Vaud according to the Swiss 
Law (protocol 3049). All procedures involving iBIP2 transgenic mice were performed 
according to a protocol approved by the Veterinary Authorities of the Canton Vaud 
according to the Swiss Law (protocol 3100).
Statistical analysis
Information on the study outline, sample size, and statistical analysis is shown in the main 
text, figures, and figure legends. For the analysis of human samples, we used the 
nonparametric unpaired Mann-Whitney U test to assess statistical significance of differences 
between two data sets. Statistical analysis by one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA, both 
with correction for multiple comparisons, was used to compare data sets involving more 
than two experimental groups. In the experiments involving cell cultures, replicates indicate 
independent cell cultures. For IHC of human melanoma samples, correlation coefficients 
were computed using the Spearman’s rank-order correlation. For the analysis of published 
RNA-seq data sets of human melanoma, correlation between selected genes was assessed 
using the Spearman’s rank-order correlation.
For the analysis of preclinical experiments involving mouse models (tumor volumes, 
quantification of immune cell infiltrates, etc.), we used either unpaired Student’s t test or 
one-way ANOVA with correction for multiple comparisons for assessing statistics involving 
two or more than two experimental groups, respectively. The statistical analysis of mouse 
survival data was performed by using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. For the comparison of 
tumor growth curves in the iBIP2 model, statistical analysis was performed using a linear 
mixed modeling approach. Briefly, we approximated each mouse’s tumor growth curve by a 
linear fit. By treating mouse-specific deviations as random, we estimated a population mean 
for each treatment group. To test whether population means were different between 
treatment groups, we compared a full model including an interaction term between the 
categorical variable representing treatment groups and the linear fit representing tumor 
growth to a null model without such interaction term. On rare occasions, outliers at endpoint 
were excluded by using the ROUT method to identify outliers (provided in GraphPad 
Prism). In some cases, selected samples were excluded from specific analyses (for example, 
flow cytometry) because of technical flaws during sample processing or data acquisition.
Data show the mean values ± SD or SEM, as indicated in the figure legends. In all statistical 
analyses, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001. All numerical values 
(primary raw data when n < 20) are reported in table S5.

 Fig. 5. Markers of CD8+ T cells and TAMs correlate with response to PD1 blockade in human 
melanoma
(A) Enrichment of melanoma-derived macrophage-specific transcriptional signature from 
(55) in CD8AHigh versus CD8ALow melanomas of the SKCM metastatic cohort (n = 369) 
(46). Genes are ranked based on mean fold change expression. Error bars indicate 95% 
confidence interval for each gene. The horizontal dashed line indicates mean fold change of 
the macrophage signature. Gray region indicates 95% confidence interval of the overall 
mean fold change. (B) CSF1, CSF1R, CD163, and CD68 expression in responder (n = 15) 
and nonresponder (n = 13) melanomas to anti-PD1 therapy, obtained from (56). 
Stratification as CD8AHigh or CD8ALow was performed using the median expression. 
Statistical analysis by Student’s t test. FPKM, fragments per kilobase of transcript per 
million mapped reads. (C) Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival in the SKCM metastatic cohort 
(n = 326, for which survival data were available) of TCGA (46), stratified as (CD8A/
CSF1R) ratio high (n = 170) or (CD8A/CSF1R) ratio low (n = 156), using median ratio as 
cutoff value. The CD8A/CSF1R ratio denotes the numeric difference between log-
transformed expression data. P value was obtained using the log-rank test and adjusted for 
tumor stage.

 TAMs (means ± SEM) at day 20 after tumor inoculation, determined by flow cytometry of 
whole tumor-derived cells. Each dot represents one tumor. Flow cytometric analysis was 
performed on tumors selected for having a comparable size (only the smaller tumors in the 
IgG and CSF1R were analyzed) from the experiment shown in (A). IgG (n = 5), α-CSF1R 
(n = 5), and α-PD1 (n = 4). Note that tumors in the combination group could not be 
analyzed because they had fully regressed by day 20. Statistical analysis by one-way 
ANOVA with Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) test. (E) Percentage of splenic 
CD8+ or CD4+ T cells (means ± SEM) determined by flow cytometry. IgG (n = 5), α-
CSF1R (n = 5), α-PD1 (n = 7), and α-CSF1R + α-PD1 (n = 4). Flow cyto-metric analysis 
was performed on spleen from mice also used in (D). For the α-PD1 group, three additional 
spleens from mice whose tumors had regressed were used to exclude differences between 
tumor-free and tumor-bearing mice. Each dot represents one spleen. Statistical analysis by 
one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction for multiple comparisons. (F) qPCR analysis of 
Adgre1 (F4/80), Mrc1 (CD206), and Ifng from whole tumor lysates. Data indicate mean fold 
change values ± SEM over the reference sample (IgG) after normalization to the average of 
Hprt and Gapdh housekeeping genes. IgG (n = 5) and α-CSF1R (n = 6 to 7). Each dot

expression in lysates of Yummer1.7 melanomas treated as indicated and analyzed at 
termination (between day 30 and day 42 after tumor challenge). Data indicate mean fold 
change values ± SEM over the reference sample (IgG) after normalization to the average of 
Hprt and Gapdh housekeeping genes. For qPCR, we analyzed tumors of the first six mice 
that reached the termination endpoint (1000 mm3) in the experiment shown in (G). IgG (n = 
5 to 6) and α-CSF1R (n = 6). Each dot represents one tumor. Statistical analysis by 
Student’s t test. ****P < 0.0001; ***P < 0.001; **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05.
