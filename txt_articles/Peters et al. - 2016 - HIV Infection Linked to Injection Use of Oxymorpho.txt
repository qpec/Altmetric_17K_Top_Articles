Key findings
Data from the National 
Vital Statistics System 
(Mortality)
 
● From 2000 through 2013, 
the age-adjusted rate for drug-
poisoning deaths involving 
heroin nearly quadrupled from 
0.7 deaths per 100,000 in 2000 
to 2.7 deaths per 100,000 in 
2013. Most of the increase 
occurred after 2010. 
 
● The number of drug-
poisoning deaths involving 
heroin was nearly four times 
higher for men (6,525 deaths) 
than women (1,732 deaths) in 
2013.
 
● In 2000, non-Hispanic black 
persons aged 45–64 had the 
highest rate for drug-poisoning 
deaths involving heroin (2.0 
per 100,000). In 2013, non-
Hispanic white persons aged 
18–44 had the highest rate (7.0 
per 100,000). 
 
● From 2000 through 2013, 
the age-adjusted rate for drug-
poisoning deaths involving 
heroin increased for all regions 
of the country, with the greatest 
increase seen in the Midwest.
Drug poisoning (overdose) is the number one cause of injury-related death 
in the United States, with 43,982 deaths occurring in 2013 (1). While much 
attention has been given to deaths involving opioid analgesics (2), in recent 
years there has been a steady increase in the number of drug-poisoning 
deaths involving heroin. A recent study using data from 28 states reported 
that the death rate for heroin overdose doubled from 2010 through 2012 (3). 
Using data from the National Vital Statistics System, this data brief provides 
a description of trends and demographics for heroin-related drug-poisoning 
deaths in the United States from 2000 through 2013.

While the age-adjusted rate for drug-poisoning deaths 
involving opioid analgesics has leveled in recent years,  
the rate for deaths involving heroin has almost tripled  
since 2010.

NOTES: The number of drug-poisoning deaths in 2013 was 43,982, the number of drug-poisoning deaths involving opioid 
analgesics was 16,235, and the number of drug-poisoning deaths involving heroin was 8,257. A small subset of 1,342 deaths 
involved both opioid analgesics and heroin. Deaths involving both opioid analgesics and heroin are included in both the rate of 
deaths involving opioid analgesics and the rate of deaths involving heroin. Access data table for Figure 1 at: http://www.cdc.gov/

From 2000 through 2013, the age-adjusted rate for drug-poisoning deaths involving opioid 
analgesics was higher than the rate for drug-poisoning deaths involving heroin (Figure 1). The 
age-adjusted rate for opioid-analgesic poisoning deaths increased at a faster pace from 2000 
through 2006 (19% per year) than from 2006 through 2013 (2% per year). From 2010 through 
2013, the age-adjusted rate for opioid-analgesic poisoning deaths declined slightly from 5.4 to 5.1 
per 100,000. In contrast, the age-adjusted rate for drug-poisoning deaths involving heroin showed 
a different pattern with a slower pace of increase between 2000 and 2010 (6% per year) and a 
faster pace of increase from 2010 forward (37% per year). From 2010 through 2013, the age-
adjusted rate for heroin-related drug-poisoning deaths nearly tripled from 1.0 per 100,000 in 2010 
to 2.7 per 100,000 in 2013.
In 2013, the number of drug-poisoning deaths involving heroin was nearly 
four times higher for men than women.
More men than women died from drug poisoning involving heroin (Figure 2). In 2013, the 
number of heroin-related drug-poisoning deaths for men (6,525 deaths) was nearly four times that 
for women (1,732 deaths). From 2010 through 2013, the age-adjusted rate increased from 1.6 to 
4.2 per 100,000 for men and from 0.4 to 1.2 per 100,000 for women.

The rate for heroin-related drug-poisoning deaths was highest among 
adults aged 25–44 from 2000 through 2013.
Compared with adults aged 18–24 and 45–64, those aged 25–44 had the highest rate for drug-
poisoning deaths involving heroin (Figure 3). From 2000 through 2010, the average annual 
increase in the rates was 10% for adults aged 18–24, 5% for those aged 25–44, and 4% for those 
aged 45–64. From 2010 through 2013, the death rate for adults aged 18–24 increased 2.3-fold 
from 1.7 to 3.9 per 100,000, for those aged 25–44 the rate increased 2.8-fold from 1.9 to 5.4, and 
for those aged 45–64 the rate increased 2.7-fold from 1.1 to 3.0.

In 2000, non-Hispanic black persons aged 45–64 had the highest rate 
for drug-poisoning deaths involving heroin. In 2013, non-Hispanic white 
persons aged 18–44 had the highest rate.
In 2000, the highest rate for drug-poisoning deaths involving heroin was among non-Hispanic 
black persons aged 45–64 (2.0 per 100,000) (Figure 4). In contrast, in 2013, the rate was highest 
among non-Hispanic white persons aged 18–44 (7.0 per 100,000). From 2000 through 2013, rates 
increased for both age groups (18–44 and 45–64) and race and ethnicity groups (non-Hispanic 
white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic), with the largest increases seen among non-Hispanic 
white persons.

From 2000 through 2013, the age-adjusted rate for drug-poisoning deaths 
involving heroin increased for all regions of the country, with the greatest 
increase seen in the Midwest.
In 2000, age-adjusted rates for drug-poisoning deaths involving heroin were higher in the 
Northeast and West regions (0.9 per 100,000) (Figure 5). In contrast, in 2013, the Midwest and 
Northeast regions had higher rates (4.3 and 3.9 per 100,000, respectively). From 2000 through 
2013, the age-adjusted rate for heroin-related drug-poisoning deaths increased nearly 11-fold in 
the Midwest region (from 0.4 to 4.3 per 100,000), more than 4-fold in the Northeast region (from 
0.9 to 3.9), more than 3-fold in the South region (from 0.5 to 1.7), and doubled in the West region 
(from 0.9 to 1.8).

Summary
This report provides the latest national statistics on drug overdose deaths involving heroin, 
highlighting the substantial increase in death rates and the populations most at risk. From 2000 
through 2013, the age-adjusted rate for drug-poisoning deaths involving heroin nearly quadrupled 
from 0.7 per 100,000 in 2000 to 2.7 per 100,000 in 2013. During this 14-year period, the age-
adjusted rate showed an average increase of 6% per year from 2000 through 2010, followed by a 
larger average increase of 37% per year from 2010 through 2013.

Identifying populations at high risk of heroin-related drug-poisoning death can help target 
prevention strategies. The number of heroin-related drug-poisoning deaths among men was nearly 
four times higher than among women. Since 2000, the rates for drug-poisoning death involving 
heroin have increased for all age and race and ethnicity groups, with adults aged 25–44 having the 
highest rate. Heroin-related drug-poisoning deaths increased for all regions of the country from 
2000 through 2013, with the greatest increase seen in the Midwest.
Data source and methods
Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality 
files (4). Deaths were classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision 
(ICD–10). Drug-poisoning deaths were defined as having an ICD–10 underlying cause-of-
death code of X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 
(undetermined intent) (5). Of the drug-poisoning deaths in 2013, 81% were unintentional, 12% 
were suicides, 6% were of undetermined intent, and less than 1% were homicides. Among deaths 
with drug poisoning as the underlying cause, the types of drugs involved are indicated by the 
ICD–10 multiple cause-of-death codes of T40.1 for heroin and T40.2, T40.3, or T40.4 for opioid 
analgesics.
Age-adjusted death rates were calculated using the direct method and the 2000 standard 
population (6). Data for Hispanic origin should be interpreted with caution. Studies comparing 
Hispanic origin on death certificates and on census surveys have shown inconsistent reporting 
on Hispanic ethnicity (6). Geographic regions were based on census definitions (7). Trends 
in death rates and number of deaths were evaluated using the Joinpoint Regression Program 
(8). Comparisons of rates among different groups were tested for statistical significance using 
methods described elsewhere (6); a statement that a given death rate is higher or lower than 
another rate indicates that the difference in the rates is statistically significant.
Several factors related to death investigation and reporting may affect measurement of death rates 
involving specific drugs. For example, toxicological tests to determine the types of drugs present 
may vary by jurisdiction (9). Measurement errors related to these factors are more likely to affect 
substance-specific death rates than the overall drug-poisoning death rate. In 2013, 22% of drug-
poisoning deaths did not include information on the specific types of drugs involved. Some of 
these deaths could potentially involve heroin or opioid analgesics.
Metabolic breakdown of heroin into morphine in the body can make it difficult to distinguish 
between deaths from heroin and deaths from morphine based on the information on the death 
certificate. Some deaths reported to involve morphine could actually be deaths from heroin. This 
may result in an undercount of heroin-related deaths.
Drug-poisoning deaths may involve multiple drugs. Analysis shows that approximately 16% of 
the drug-poisoning deaths involving heroin also involve opioid analgesics. This percentage is 
relatively consistent across time, age groups, and race and ethnicity groups.
