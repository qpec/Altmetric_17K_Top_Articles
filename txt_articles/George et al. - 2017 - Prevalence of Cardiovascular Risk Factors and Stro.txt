in Younger Adults
Mary G. George, MD, MSPH; Xin Tong, MPH; Barbara A. Bowman, PhD
IMPORTANCE While stroke mortality rates have decreased substantially in the past 2 decades,
this trend has been primarily limited to older adults. Increasing trends in stroke incidence and
hospitalizations have been noted among younger adults, but there has been concern that this
reflected improved diagnosis through an increased use of imaging rather than representing a
real increase.
OBJECTIVES To determine whether stroke hospitalization rates have continued to increase
and to identify the prevalence of associated stroke risk factors among younger adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Hospitalization data from the National Inpatient Sample
from 1995 through 2012 were used to analyze acute stroke hospitalization rates among adults
aged 18 to 64 years. Hospitalization data from 2003 to 2012 were used to identify the
prevalence of associated risk factors for acute stroke. Acute stroke hospitalizations were
identified by the principal International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification code and associated risk factors were identified by secondary International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for each hospitalization.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Trends in acute stroke hospitalization rates by stroke type,
age, sex, and race/ethnicity, as well as the prevalence of associated risk factors by stroke type,
age, and sex.
RESULTS The 2003-2004 set included 362 339 hospitalizations and the 2011-2012 set
included 421 815 hospitalizations. The major findings in this study are as follows: first, acute
ischemic stroke hospitalization rates increased significantly for both men and women and
for certain race/ethnic groups among younger adults aged 18 to 54 years; they have almost
doubled for men aged 18 to 34 and 35 to 44 years since 1995-1996, with a 41.5% increase
among men aged 35 to 44 years from 2003-2004 to 2011-2012. Second, the prevalence of
stroke risk factors among those hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke continued to increase
from 2003-2004 through 2011-2012 for both men and women aged 18 to 64 years (range
of absolute increase: hypertension, 4%-11%; lipid disorders, 12%-21%; diabetes, 4%-7%;
tobacco use, 5%-16%; and obesity, 4%-9%). Third, the prevalence of having 3 to 5 risk factors
increased from 2003-2004 through 2011-2012 (men: from 9% to 16% at 18-34 years, 19% to
35% at 35-44 years, 24% to 44% at 45-54 years, and 26% to 46% at 55-64 years; women:
6% to 13% at 18-34 years, 15% to 32% at 35-44 years, 25% to 44% at 45-54 years, and 27%
to 48% at 55-65 years; P for trend < .001). Finally, hospitalization rates for intracerebral
hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage remained stable, with the exception of declines
among men and non-Hispanic black patients aged 45 to 54 with subarachnoid hemorrhage
(13.2/10 000 to 10.3/10 000 hospitalizations and 15.8/10 000 to 11.5/10 000
hospitalizations, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The identification of increasing hospitalization rates for acute
ischemic stroke in young adults coexistent with increasing prevalence of traditional stroke risk
factors confirms the importance of focusing on prevention in younger adults.

troke was the third leading cause of death in the United
States from 1938 to 2007, and dropped to the fifth lead-
ing cause of death in 2013.1 Yet, the relative rate of de-
cline in mortality among those aged 65 years and older is ap-
proximately double the rate of decline among those aged 45
to 64 years.1 The overall decline in stroke mortality over the
past 50 years reflects the improved control of hypertension
through efforts such as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute’
s Joint National Commission guidelines on hyper-
tension control, as well as increased treatment of atrial fibril-
lation with anticoagulants, increased use of aspirin for sec-
ondary prevention, improvements in stroke care through
structured quality improvement programs, and the develop-
ment of stroke systems of care that promote the use of evi-
dence-based care.2

stand whether these risk factor patterns are similar among
those experiencing an acute stroke. To identify whether pre-
vious trends in stroke hospitalization rates and the patterns
ofassociatedriskfactorshavecontinued,weexaminedthehos-
pitalization rates for acute stroke by stroke type along with the
prevalence of associated risk factors by sex and age group
among younger adults (aged 18 to 64 years).
Methods
Data Sources and Study Sample
The National Inpatient Sample (NIS)8 is part of the Health-
care Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP),8 sponsored by the
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The NIS is a da-
tabase of hospital inpatient stays derived from billing data sub-
mitted by hospitals to statewide data organizations across the
United States. It is a stratified sample that represents dis-
charges from approximately 20% of all community hospitals
participating in HCUP; hospitals are selected based on 5 char-
acteristics: rural/urban location, hospital size, region, teach-
ing status, and ownership. There were 37 states that partici-
pated in 2003 and the number of states increased each year
to 44 states in 2012.8 Because the data are publicly available
and do not contain direct personal identifiers, this study was
exempt from review by the institutional review board, per
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidelines.
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes were used to identify
hospitalizations for subarachnoid hemorrhage (430), intrace-
rebral hemorrhage (431), and acute ischemic stroke (AIS)
(433.01, 433.11, 433.21, 433.31, 433.81, 433.91, 434.01, 434.11,
434.91, and 436). For each hospitalization, only the principal
diagnosis code was used to identify events, which were then
assigned to 1 of 3 mutually exclusive categories: subarach-
noid hemorrhage (SAH), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH),
and AIS.
The ICD-9-CM code 436 was included in ischemic stroke
as recommended by HCUP when doing trend over time analy-
sisacrossthetimeascodinginstructionschangedforthiscode.
The use of this code underwent a change in fiscal year 2005,
where coders were instructed to use code 434.91 rather
than 436.
Statistical Methods
The unit of analysis was hospital discharge. In this analysis,
hospital discharge records were included if the patient was 18
years or older at the time of the hospital admission. We com-
bined NIS annual data to create 5 consecutive 2-year periods
from 2003-2004 through 2011-2012. Four age groups were de-
fined: 18 to 34 years, 35 to 44 years, 45 to 54 years, and 55 to
64 years. Separate stroke hospitalization rates for men and
womenwereestimatedforeachstroketypeandagegroup.Risk
factor prevalence was estimated using secondary ICD-9-CM
codes, taking into account changes in ICD-9-CM coding over
time (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Common risk factors for
stroke in this population were assessed for linear trends using
orthogonal polynomial contrasts. We also looked at the com-
bination of the following 5 traditional cardiovascular risk fac-
tors related to the stroke: hypertension, diabetes, lipid disor-
ders, obesity, and tobacco use, which were identified as none,
1 to 2 risk factors, or 3 to 5 risk factors to address the burden
of multiple stroke risk factors. Linear trends were not re-
ported if the data were too sparse to report based on HCUP re-
porting guidelines. Further, trends in stroke hospitalizations
for those aged 18 to 34, 35 to 44, 45 to 54, and 55 to 64 years
by sex from 1995 to 2012 were assessed across 5 periods by
using linear regression models.
National estimates were obtained by using individual dis-
charge sampling weights. As a result of changes imple-
mentedintheredesignof2012NISdata,weusedtrendweights
developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qual-
ity to make estimates comparable for data prior to 2012. All sta-
tistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3–
Key Points
Questions Are stroke hospitalization rates for younger adults
continuing to increase, and is the prevalence of associated risk
factors increasing among those hospitalized for acute stroke?
Findings This analysis found that stroke hospitalization rates from
2003 to 2012 significantly increased for acute ischemic stroke
hospitalization rates among men (41.5%) and women (30%) aged
35 to 44 years, with a near doubling of the prevalence of 3 or more
of 5 common stroke risk factors among both men and women
aged 18 to 64 years hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke.
Meaning Hospitalization rates for acute ischemic stroke in
younger adults continued to increase since 1995-1996, coexistent
with increasing prevalence of stroke risk factors.

Results
Among acute ischemic stroke hospitalizations, rates in-
creased from 2003-2004 through 2011-2012 for all race/
ethnic groups; men; and women in age groups 18 to 34, 35 to
44, and 45 to 54 years, except among non-Hispanic black in-
dividuals and other race groups for ages 18 to 34 years. Among
those aged 55 to 64 years, only Hispanic individuals showed
a significant increase in AIS hospitalization rates (from 181.8/
10 000 to 199.7/10 000; P = .02), but there was no change in
stroke hospitalization rates in this age group by sex or among
other non-Hispanic race groups (Table 1).
The hospitalization rate for men aged 18 to 34 years in-
creased from 11.2 to 18.0 per 10 000 hospitalizations; for
women aged 18 to 34 years, it increased from 3.8 to 5.8 per
10 000 hospitalizations; for men aged 35 to 44 years, it in-
creased from 37.7 to 68.2 per 10 000 hospitalizations; and for
women aged 35 to 44, it increased from 24.8 to 35.8 per 10 000
hospitalizations from 1995-1996 through 2011-2012 (relative
percentage increases were 74.8%, 65.7%, 91.0%, and 53.6%,
respectively) (eFigure and eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Table 2 shows the prevalence of stroke-related risk fac-
tors among adults admitted for AIS by age and sex. Across all
age groups and both sexes, increasing prevalence was seen in
hypertension, lipid disorders, diabetes, tobacco use, obesity,
and among multiple risk factors. The prevalence of 3 or more
traditional risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, lipid disor-
ders, obesity, and tobacco use) roughly doubled among all age
groups for both men and women, while the prevalence of none
of these risk factors decreased. Notably, during the study pe-
riod of 2003-2004 through 2011-2012, hypertension in-
creased from 34.0% to 41.3%, and lipid disorders increased
from 14.6% to 29.1% among men aged 18 to 34 years. Smaller
increases were seen among women aged 18 to 34 years, al-
though in 2011-2012, 30.7% had hypertension, 21.7% had lipid
disorders, 26.5% used tobacco, and 15.7% were obese. One
in 7 men aged 18 to 34 years and 1 in 3 men aged 35 to 44 years
had 3 to 5 traditional risk factors. There were small but

 significant increases in the prevalence of atrial fibrillation
amongtheolder2agegroupsforbothmenandwomen.Among
those with AIS, the prevalence of ischemic heart disease de-
clined among men aged 45 to 54 and 55 to 64 years, yet in-
creased among women aged 18 to 34 years. There were no
changes among the other sex/age groups (Table 2).
There were no changes in ICH hospitalization rates by age,
race/ethnicity, or sex from 2003-2004 through 2011-2012
(Table 3). However, men had significantly higher hospitaliza-
tion rates than women among all age groups. The relative dif-
ference between men and women decreased with increasing
age group.
Among those with ICH, the prevalence of hypertension
among men in 2011-2012 was 44.1% (aged 18-34 years), 73.8%
(aged 35-44 years), and 81.4% (aged 45-54 and 55-64 years),
and the prevalence of hypertension among men aged 18 to 34
and 35 to 44 years with ICH was higher than the prevalence
among their counterparts with AIS. Rates of hypertension
among women with ICH were comparable with those with AIS
(Table 2 and Table 4). Tobacco use increased among all male
age groups and among women aged 18 to 34, 45 to 54, and 55
to 64 years. There was a significant trend toward increasing
prevalence of having multiple stroke risk factors among men
and women across all age groups among those hospitalized for
ICH (Table 4).
From 2003-2004 through 2011-2012, hospitalization rates
for SAH declined among all age groups, but significantly only
among men aged 45 to 54 years (13.2/10 000 to 10.3/10 000;
P = .01), non-Hispanic white individuals (14.5/10 000 to 11.9/
10 000; P = .045), and non-Hispanic black individuals (15.8/
10 000 to 11.5/10 000; P = .006). Rates of SAH among His-
panic individuals aged 45 to 54 and 55 to 64 years were
significantly higher compared with non-Hispanic white and
non-Hispanic black individuals. The hospitalization rate for
men aged 18 to 35 years were 3 times the rate of women, but
women had significantly higher hospitalization rates for SAH
among those aged 45 to 54 and 55 to 64 years (Table 3).
Significant increases in the prevalence of stroke risk fac-
tors were seen among hospitalizations for SAH across all age
groups of men for hypertension, obesity, and tobacco use and

 for lipid disorders and diabetes among men aged 35 to 44, 45
to 54, and 55 to 64 years. Among women with acute SAH hos-
pitalizations, the prevalence of hypertension increased among
allagegroups,andtheprevalenceofdiabetes,obesity,andlipid
disorders increased among age groups 35 to 44, 45 to 54, and
55 to 64 years. Women aged 45 to 54 years had an increased
prevalence of alcohol abuse and tobacco use. The presence of
multiple risk factors (inclusive of hypertension, diabetes, lipid
disorders, obesity, and tobacco use) shifted toward a greater
number of risk factors among both men and women across all
age groups (Table 5).
For most age groups and stroke types, there were trends
of decreasing in-hospital death and increasing trends of trans-
fer to skilled nursing units/rehabilitation facilities/long-term
care facilities (eTable 3, eTable 4, and eTable 5 in the Supple-
ment). While this data set lacks important socioeconomic data,
we found that among all age groups and stroke types, be-
tween56%and60%ofstrokehospitalizationsoccurredamong
the lower 50th percentile of median household income of the
patients’zip code, with no change over time.
Overall, AIS hospitalizations among those aged 18 to 64
years increased from an average of 141 474 per year in 2003-
2004 to 171 386 per year in 2011-2012. Hospitalizations for SAH
declined from an average of 17 598 per year in 2003-2004 to
15 974peryearin2011-2012.Therewaslittlechangeinthenum-
ber of hospitalizations for ICH (22 097/year in 2003-2004 vs
23 545/year in 2011-2012).
Discussion
The major findings in this study are as follows: first, AIS hos-
pitalization rates increased for both men and women and for
certain race/ethnic groups among younger adults aged 18 to
54, and they have almost doubled for men aged 18 to 34 and
35 to 44 years since 1995-1996, while rates for men and women

 aged 55 to 64 have not changed from 2003-2004. Second, the
hospitalization rates for ICH did not change from 2003-2004
to 2011-2012 among those aged 18 to 64 years, while the only
change in hospitalization rates for SAH was a decrease among
men and non-Hispanic individuals aged 45 to 54 years. Third,
the prevalence rates of multiple risk factors associated with
people experiencing AIS and ICH hospitalizations have con-
tinued to increase for both men and women of all age groups
studied over the most recent decade of available data, and they
are consistent with increases seen from 1995-1996 and 2007-
2008. Finally, the prevalence of having multiple traditional
stroke risk factors among young adults experiencing an AIS
has doubled over the decade from 2003-2004 through
2011-2012.
The increasing trends in AIS hospitalization rates among
the 3 younger age groups (18-34 years: 27.3% increase; 35-44
years:35.6%increase;and45-54years:20.5%increase)arecon-
sistent with other studies,3,9 as well as earlier hospitalization
trends.4 They are also associated with high and increasing
trends in the prevalence of having multiple traditional cardio-
vascular risk factors.9-12 This is also consistent with a clinical
study reported 25 years ago, which found that among young
adults aged 15 to 45 years, AIS was due to atherosclerotic dis-
ease in one-third of patients.13 Both small- and large-vessel dis-
ease have been identified as an increasing cause of AIS begin-
ning at age 30 years.14 It is unclear why hospitalization rates
among non-Hispanic black individuals aged 18 to 34 years re-
mained stable; however, Kissela et al3 noted a nonsignificant
increase in incident stroke rates among black individuals aged
20 to 44 years from 1993 to 2005 and yet a significant in-
crease among white individuals. The young adult population
experiencing AIS has rates of traditional stroke risk factors that
are also nearly double that of their peers in the general popu-
lation or greater.7 Approximately 12% of the general popula-
tion aged 45 to 64 years has diabetes,7 yet approximately 40%
of those hospitalized with an AIS had diabetes. Tobacco use
is high among men of all age groups experiencing an AIS, at
rates nearly double the national rate among adults. In com-

 parison with European studies on stroke in young adults, we
found similar rates of lipid disorders, atrial fibrillation, and to-
bacco use, but much higher rates of hypertension, diabetes,
and ischemic heart disease.14 We found a lower prevalence of
obesity than other traditional risk factors and yet obesity has
been identified as a major risk factor for stroke in young
adults.15-17 This could be due to underreporting in an admin-
istrative data set. The shift to an increasing number of mul-
tiple traditional risk factors for stroke and the extremely high
and increasing prevalence of hypertension among those hos-
pitalized with all stroke types is of particular concern, as the
hypertension control rate among men aged 18 to 39 years is
only 27.9%.18
One in 3 acute stroke hospitalizations for all stroke, AIS,
and ICH occurs among those aged 18 to 64 years, while 60%
ofSAHhospitalizationsoccuramongadultsaged18to64years,
when adults are in their prime years for productive careers and
busy family lives.19 Most age, race/ethnic, and sex groups had
nonsignificant decreasing trends in hospitalization rates for
SAH, with only modest, although significant, decreases among
men aged 45 to 54 years. Hypertension, tobacco use, and al-
cohol use are among the most important risk factors for SAH.20
We saw significant increases in hypertension, tobacco use, and
drug abuse only among men and women aged 55 to 64 years
and among women aged 45 to 54 years, but no significant in-
crease in alcohol abuse among those with SAH. With increas-
ing prevalence of key risk factors for SAH, the trend toward
stable or decreasing hospitalizations for SAH are difficult to ex-
plain. There are improved diagnostic modalities for other ce-
rebral conditions that could be leading to increased inciden-
tal findings of aneurysms from imaging for other reasons.
Managementandprophylactictreatmentpriortorupturewhen
indicated could in part explain decreases in hospitalizations
for SAH.21
Nearly 40% of ICH hospitalizations occur in those aged 18
to 64 years.19 Because intracerebral hemorrhage can result in
significant morbidity and mortality, the relatively high preva-
lence of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors among men aged 18 to
34 years (drug abuse: 14.3%; tobacco use: 25.8%; and hyper-

 stroke in this study. The findings that Hispanic and non-
Hispanic black individuals have ICH hospitalization rates 1.5
to 2 times the rates for white individuals is not inconsistent
with the findings from Walsh et al,22 which found an in-
creased risk for ICH among Hispanic and non-Hispanic black
individuals with treated or untreated hypertension among
younger age groups compared with white individuals. They
concluded that untreated hypertension confers a greater ICH
risk in black and Hispanic relative to white individuals.
These findings of increasing AIS hospitalization rates
among those aged 18 to 54 years and no change among those
aged 55 to 64 years reveals an inflection point in stroke hos-
pitalization rates when compared with findings of decreasing
AIS hospitalization rates among those aged 65 to 74 and 75 to
84 years, and a nonsignificant decline among those 85 years
and older.23,24 We identified no change in the hospitalization
rate for ICH among those aged 18 to 64 years, while others have
seen decreasing rates among those with ICH aged 65 to 74, 75
to 84, and 85 years and older.23 It is possible that these find-
ings represent better hypertension control over time among
elderly people compared with younger adults. We only noted
a decrease in SAH hospitalization rates among those aged 45
to 54 years, while others also noted no change in rates among
the 3 oldest age groups.23
Strengths and Limitations
This study has several strengths in that the data are nation-
ally representative of hospitalizations in the United States
and provide the ability to report trends over time. The
reported comorbidities and risk factors were documented in
the medical record using ICD-9-CM codes. However, there are
some limitations. First, a person who experiences more than
1 hospitalization for an acute stroke during a 2-year analytic
period would be represented for each acute stroke hospital-
ization event. Second, while one can identify the prevalence
of multiple comorbidities, we are unable to characterize
stroke severity nor the cause of the stroke. Third, while we
cannot rule out any influence of increased use of advanced
imaging over time, Kissela et al3 found high rates of the use of
computed tomography (87%) and magnetic resonance
imaging (60%-70%) among younger adults by 2005, and the
impact of magnetic resonance imaging findings does not
appear to influence stroke incidence,5 making it unlikely that
the trends in stroke hospitalizations among younger adults
are due solely to increased imaging and hence increased
detection. Finally, we are unable to account for several
important risk factors such as family history or the use of
estrogen-based medications.
Conclusions
The young adult population is experiencing an increase in a
serious yet largely preventable disease. We note the trend of
increasing AIS among Hispanic individuals (a small but rela-
tive increase of 41% among those aged 18-34 years) of all age
groups as a particularly important demographic to assure ac-
cess to adequate stroke prevention. The significant increases
in ischemic stroke hospitalizations and associated traditional
stroke risk factors from 2003-2012, which is consistent with
rates from 1995-1996 and 2007-2008 among those experienc-
ing an acute stroke4 should serve as a call to action to focus
onimprovingthehealthofyoungeradults.Preventingandcon-
trollingstrokeriskfactorsamongyoungworking-ageadultscan
savelives,reducedisability,decreasesocietalhealthcarecosts,
and improve the quality of life for hundreds of thousands of
Americans and their families. Identifying the high and rising
prevalence of stroke risk factors among younger adults pre-
senting with acute stroke should prompt a sense of urgency
among younger adults, public health practitioners, clini-
cians, and policy makers to engage adolescents and their fami-
lies, as well as younger adults, to identify and treat stroke risk
factors and promote opportunities that allow for healthy life-
styles to prevent the tragedy of stroke at such early ages.
