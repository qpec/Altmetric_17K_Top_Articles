Purpose
Patients with double-hit lymphoma (DHL) rarely achieve long-term survival following disease re-
lapse. Some patients with DHL undergo consolidative autologous stem-cell transplantation
(autoSCT) to reduce the risk of relapse, although the benefit of this treatment strategy is unclear.
Methods
Patients with DHL who achieved first complete remission following completion of front-line therapy
with either rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) or
intensive front-line therapy, and deemed fit for autoSCT, were included. A landmark analysis was
performed, with time zero defined as 3 months after completion of front-line therapy. Patients who
experienced relapse before or who were not followed until that time were excluded.
Results
Relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates at 3 years were 80% and 87%, re-
spectively, for all patients (n = 159). Three-year RFS and OS rates did not differ significantly for
autoSCT (n = 62) versus non-autoSCT patients (n = 97), but 3-year RFS was inferior in patients who
received R-CHOP compared with intensive therapy (56% v 88%; P = .002). Three-year RFS and OS
did not differ significantly for patients in the R-CHOP or intensive therapy cohorts when analyzed by
receipt of autoSCT. The median OS following relapse was 8.6 months.
Conclusion
In the largest reported series, to our knowledge, of patients with DHL to achieve first complete
remission, consolidative autoSCT was not associated with improved 3-year RFS or OS. In addition,
patients treated with R-CHOP experienced inferior 3-year RFS compared with those who received
intensive front-line therapy. When considered in conjunction with reports of patients with newly
diagnosed DHL, which demonstrate lower rates of disease response to R-CHOP compared with
intensive front-line therapy, our findings further support the use of intensive front-line therapy for this
patient population.

INTRODUCTION
Double-hit lymphoma (DHL), defined as a B-cell
non-Hodgkin lymphoma harboring rearrange-
ment of MYC as well as BCL2 and/or BCL6,1 has
been described as a high-risk variant of aggressive
non-Hodgkin lymphoma in several retrospective
series, with a reported median overall survival
(OS) of , 2 years.2-7 Within the population of
patients with DHL, a worse prognosis has been
associated with multiple clinicopathologic features
present at diagnosis, including B-cell lymphoma
unclassifiable (BCLU) histologic classification,2
evidence of MYC-IG translocation,2,8,9 bone
marrow involvement,2,4 elevated serum lactate
dehydrogenase,4,6 and CNS involvement.4,6
With the recognition of the poor survival
experienced by patients with DHL, chemotherapy
intensification has been explored as one strategy
for improving outcomes in this population.
Although earlier single-institution reports did
not reveal a benefit from intensified front-
line chemotherapy,2,4 two large retrospective

 multicenter studies suggested prolongation of progression-free
survival (PFS), but not OS, in patients with DHL treated with
intensive front-line therapy compared with rituximab plus cyclo-
phosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP).6,10
A second application of chemotherapy intensification for
patients with DHL has been high-dose chemotherapy with au-
tologous stem-cell transplantation (autoSCT) in patients achieving
first complete remission (CR1). This treatment strategy may be
particularly relevant for the population of patients with DHL, given
the poor prognosis following relapse of this disease,5,6 and more
specifically, the low likelihood of achieving long-term remission
following salvage immunochemotherapy and autoSCT.11 Although
receipt of autoSCT seemed to prolong PFS in patients with high-
risk aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma achieving CR1,12 the
benefit of autoSCT in CR1 could not be clearly determined in two
retrospective series of patients with DHL,5,6 as a result of the small
sample size of patients achieving CR1, as well as lack of analysis of
patient-, disease-, and treatment-related factors that may be
predictive of survival in this patient population.
Herein, we report outcomes for a large multicenter series of
patients with DHL who achieved CR1, analyzing the impact of
front-line therapy and autoSCT in CR1 on relapse and survival.
METHODS
Patients
DHLwas defined as high-grade B-cell lymphoma with rearrangement
of MYC/8q24 as well as BCL2/18q21 and/or BCL6/3q27 as assessed by
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or conventional karyotype.1
Inclusion criteria included diagnosis between January 2006 and Decem-
ber 2015, age 18 to 72 years, an overall condition deemed fit for autoSCT by
the local investigator, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or BCLU
histologic classifications and receipt of front-line treatment with either
R-CHOP or intensive therapy, defined as either DA-EPOCH-R (etoposide,
prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin), R-hyper-
CVAD (hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin,
and dexamethasone alternating with methotrexate and cytarabine), or
R-CODOX-M/IVAC (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and
high-dose methotrexate alternating with ifosfamide, etoposide, and
cytarabine). Exclusion criteria included , 3 months in remission following
completion of front-line therapy (equating to # 7.5 months after diagnosis
for patients receiving R-CHOP, DA-EPOCH-R, and R-CODOX-M/IVAC
and # 9.0 months after diagnosis for patients receiving R-hyperCVAD),
the presence of HIV, receipt of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, and
a history of indolent lymphoma treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Cell
of origin classification was defined per the Hans algorithm.13 When staging
bone marrow aspiration and biopsy was not performed, patients with
lymphomatous involvement of the peripheral blood by high-grade lym-
phoma were considered to have bone marrow involvement, whereas
patients without abnormal [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the bones
were considered not to have bone marrow involvement by high-grade
lymphoma.14 Cases were reviewed by hematopathologists at each academic
medical center per routine clinical practice. Criteria and methods for
performance of fluorescent in situ hybridization were per the policy of each
center. Therapy was prescribed at the discretion of the treating physician.
Data were censored in October 2016. This protocol was approved by the
institutional review board of each participating center.
Statistical Analysis
As previously described,15 a landmark analysis was performed with
time zero occurring at 3 months after completion of front-line therapy.
Relapse-free survival (RFS) was defined as the interval from time zero to
disease relapse or last follow-up in remission. OS was defined as the in-
terval from time zero to death from any cause or last follow-up. Disease
response by computed tomography with or without positron emission
tomography was determined by the Revised Response Criteria for Ma-
lignant Lymphoma.16 Categorical data were analyzed by the x2 test. RFS
and OS curves were plotted using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and survival
analysis was performed using the log-rank test. Univariable analysis was
performed using Cox proportional-hazards regression. Statistical signifi-
cance was defined as a two-tailed P value , .05. All statistical analyses were
performed using Stata version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Patients
One hundred fifty-nine cases from 19 US academic medical
centers were included in this analysis. Baseline clinicopathologic
characteristics for all patients, as well as comparison by receipt of
autoSCT in CR1, are listed in Table 1. The only statistically sig-
nificant differences between the non-autoSCT (n = 97) and autoSCT
(n = 62) patients were age . 60 years (49% v 29%; P = .01), bone
marrow involvement (33% v 19%; P = .04), and prior indolent
lymphoma (6% v 23%; P = .002). For those patients with prior
indolent lymphoma (n = 20), management strategies for indolent
lymphoma included no treatment (n = 17), rituximab monotherapy
(n = 2), and radiation therapy (n = 1).
Outcomes
With a median follow-up of 26.5 months (range, 0.2 to
114.6 months) from time zero, the 3-year RFS and OS rates for all
patients were 80% and 87%, respectively (Figs 1A and 1B). No
significant differences in 3-year RFS and OS rates were seen be-
tween patients with de novo (n = 139) versus transformed indolent
(n = 20) disease (78% v 94%, P = .18 and 86% v 93%, P = .54,
respectively) nor International Prognostic Index score , 3 (n = 84)
versus $ 3 (n = 71; 75% v 87%, P =.38 and 87% v 89%, P = .69,
respectively). On the basis of gene rearrangement status, 3-year
RFS and OS rates were 79% and 86% for patients whose tumors
demonstrated BCL2 rearrangement, 77% and 80% for BCL6
rearrangement, and 70% and 73% for BCL2/BCL6 rearrangement
(triple-hit lymphoma), respectively. For patients with lymphomas
that were known to demonstrate MYC-IG translocation (n = 35),
3-year RFS and OS rates were 77% and 88%, respectively.
When analyzed by receipt of autoSCT in CR1, non-autoSCT
and autoSCT patients experienced similar rates of 3-year RFS (75%
v 89%; P = .12) and OS (85% v 91%; P = .74; Figs 2A and 2B). No
significant differences in 3-year RFS and OS rates were observed
when non-autoSCT (n = 91) and autoSCT (n = 48) patients with
de novo disease were analyzed separately (74% v 88%, P = .15 and
84% v 91%, P = .68, respectively). Compared with patients in the
autoSCT group, patients in the non-autoSCT group were less likely
to be known to have received CNS prophylaxis with front-line
therapy (57% v 75%; P = .02) and intensive front-line therapy
(72% v 87%; P = .03).
Additional analysis by front-line therapy received revealed that
3-year RFS rates differed significantly among patients treated with
R-CHOP (n = 35), DA-EPOCH-R (n = 81), R-hyperCVAD (n = 32),

 and R-CODOX-M/IVAC (n =11; 56% v 88% v 87% v 91%, re-
spectively; P = .003), but 3-year OS rates did not (77% v 87% v
90% v 100%, respectively; P = .36; Figs 3A and 3B). Given the
similar 3-year RFS and OS for DA-EPOCH-R, R-hyperCVAD, and
R-CODOX-M/IVAC patients (P = .90 and P = .57, respectively),
these three regimens were combined into a single intensive front-line
therapy cohort (n = 124), with a 3-year RFS rate of 88% (P = .002
compared with R-CHOP) and an OS rate of 90% (P = .13 compared
with R-CHOP; Figs 3C and 3D). Patients in the R-CHOP group were
less likely to be known to have received CNS prophylaxis with front-
line therapy (28% v 72%; P = .001) and autoSCT in CR1 (23% v
44%; P = .03) compared with patients in the intensive group. Of
note, comparison of baseline clinicopathologic characteristics listed
in Table 1 between R-CHOP and intensive patients demonstrated

 a statistically significant difference only in age . 60 years (57% v
37%; P = .03).
A final analysis of outcomes on the basis of both front-line
therapy and receipt of autoSCT in CR1 was performed. For
patients receiving R-CHOP front-line therapy without autoSCT
in CR1 (R-CHOP/non-autoSCT, n = 27), 3-year RFS and OS
rates were 51% and 75%; for patients receiving R-CHOP front-
line therapy and autoSCT in CR1 (R-CHOP/autoSCT, n = 8),
3-year RFS and OS rates were 75% and 83%; for patients re-
ceiving intensive front-line therapy without SCT in CR1
(intensive/non-autoSCT, n = 70), 3-year RFS and OS rates were
86% and 89%, respectively; and for patients receiving intensive
front-line therapy and autoSCT in CR1 (intensive/autoSCT,
n = 54), 3-year RFS and OS rates were 91% and 92%, re-
spectively. Intergroup comparison showed a statistically sig-
nificant difference in 3-year RFS (P = .003), which was because
of a significantly lower rate of 3-year RFS for R-CHOP/non-
autoSCT compared with intensive/non-autoSCT (P = .003) and
intensive/autoSCT (P = .001) patients, but similar 3-year OS
(P = .50; Figs 3E and 3F).
None of the baseline clinicopathologic characteristics listed in
Table 1 were significantly associated with 3-year RFS or OS in all
patients by univariable analysis. In addition, univariable analysis of
the baseline clinicopathologic features listed in Table 1 demonstrated
that no factor was associated with either 3-year RFS or OS when
analyzing patients receiving front-line R-CHOP and intensive front-
line therapy separately. Receipt of autoSCT in CR1 was also not
associated with 3-year RFS or OS for patients receiving front-line
R-CHOP (P = .51 and P = .85, respectively) or front-line intensive
therapy (P = .47 and P = .92, respectively) by univariable analysis.
Relapse and Death
Twenty-five patients relapsed with a median OS of 8.6 months
(range, 0 to 43.0 months) after relapse, with a 1-year postrelapse
survival rate of 37% (Fig 4). Postrelapse survival did not differ by
treatment with R-CHOP (n = 13) compared with intensive (n = 12)

compared with no receipt (n = 19) of autoSCT in CR1 (9.7 v
3.8 months; P = .12). Only one patient with prior indolent lymphoma
experienced disease relapse, which was of high-grade histologic
classification. CNS relapse was diagnosed in five of these patients,
three of whom received CNS prophylaxis with front-line therapy, with
one each receiving intrathecal only, intravenous only, and combi-
nation intrathecal/intravenous therapy. Nineteen patients died, with
five deaths during remission (one each from amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, lung cancer, and unknown causes in non-autoSCT patients
and from infection and acute myeloid leukemia in autoSCT patients.
DISCUSSION
DHL is an aggressive form of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that
is associated with a poor prognosis. However, prior studies have
suggested that outcome may be improved for DHL patients re-
ceiving intensive front-line immunochemotherapy. A series of 129
patients with DHL published by the MD Anderson Cancer Center
reported a CR1 rate of 40% in patients treated with front-line
R-CHOP, whichwas significantly lower than 68% for DA-EPOCH-R
and R-hyperCVAD, and patients treated with DA-EPOCH-R ex-
perienced a significantly improved event-free survival rate compared
with those who received R-CHOP.5 A US multicenter study of 311
patients with DHL reported a significantly lower CR1 rate for patients
treated with R-CHOP compared with DA-EPOCH-R, and a shorter
median PFS for patients receiving R-CHOP compared with intensive
front-line therapy (7.8 v 21.6 months).6
What is apparent from these two studies is the difficulty in
salvaging patients with DHL if they are experiencing relapse, with
a 3-year OS rate of 7%5 and a median OS of 176 months in patients
receiving therapy at relapse. Although it is possible for patients
with DHL to achieve long-term survival if undergoing autoSCT
after disease relapse, autoSCT is unlikely to provide durable disease
control in this setting.11,17
Thus, despite the potential toxicity associated with autoSCT,
the dismal outcome of relapsed DHL warrants consideration of
consolidative autoSCT for patients achieving CR1 as a strategy to
reduce the likelihood of disease relapse. Subgroup analyses of DHL
patients achieving CR1 within the two aforementioned studies
have demonstrated no significant difference in PFS or OS observed
in 23 patients receiving SCT and 48 patients not receiving SCT in
the MD Anderson Cancer Center series5 and 39 and 112 patients,
respectively, in the US multicenter study.6 However, conclusions
drawn about the benefit of SCT in CR1 within these studies are
limited by multiple factors, including small cohorts of patients
undergoing SCT, lack of analysis of baseline clinicopathologic
characteristics and therapy received within the SCT and non-SCT
cohorts, as well as inclusion of patients receiving allogenic SCTand
cytotoxic therapy for prior indolent lymphoma.
Through a landmark analysis of 159 patients with DHL achieving
CR1, we have demonstrated a 3-year RFS rate of 80% and a 3-year OS
rate of 87% for all patients, which did not differ significantly on the
basis of receipt of autoSCT in CR1. Comparison of baseline char-
acteristics between autoSCTand non-autoSCT patients suggested that
autoSCT patients were more likely to be # 60 years of age, lack bone
marrow involvement, and have a history of transformed indolent
lymphoma; however, none of these characteristics were prognostic of
3-year RFS or 3-year OS on univariable analysis. Therefore, the
apparent lack of benefit of autoSCT in CR1 is not confounded by
a relevant difference in prognostic baseline clinicopathologic char-
acteristics between patients receiving and not receiving autoSCT.
Interestingly, within this cohort, patients receiving R-CHOP
front-line therapy experienced inferior rates of 3-year RFS compared
with those receiving intensive front-line therapy. No significant
differences in 3-year RFS and OS were noted in the R-CHOP or
intensive therapy patient cohorts when analyzed by baseline clini-
copathologic characteristics or receipt of autoSCT in CR1. Although
patients treated with R-CHOP were more frequently older than
60 years compared with those receiving intensive induction, age
older than 60 years was not associated with 3-year RFS or OS on
univariable analysis of all patients. In addition, although patients
treated with R-CHOP were less likely to receive CNS prophylaxis
compared with those receiving intensive induction, the fact that CNS
prophylaxis was received by three of five patients experiencing CNS
relapse suggests that this statistical difference is of limited clinical
significance. One explanation for improved outcomes for patients
treated with intensive front-line therapy may be that although all
patients in our cohort demonstrated radiographic complete re-
sponse, those treated with intensive regimens may have been more
likely to achieve a deeper disease response that is not distinguishable
by standard postchemotherapy radiographic assessment. Techniques
for detection of minimal residual disease following front-line
therapy, such as circulating tumor DNA, should be investigated
in future studies of patients with DHL.
Also of interest were the survival outcomes for patients in the
R-CHOP/autoSCT cohort, which did not differ significantly from
those for patients receiving intensive therapy. This former group of
patients represented only 5% of all patients included in this analysis;
thus the small sample size of this cohort limits the generalizability of
these results. Also, given the aforementioned data, which demon-
strate an inferior rate of CR1 achievement in patients with DHL
treated with R-CHOP compared with intensive therapy, it cannot be
safely assumed that patients with DHL treated with R-CHOP will
necessarily achieve CR1 and subsequently be able to receive con-
solidative autoSCT. Nevertheless, if encountering a patient with

Outcomes of Patients With DHL Achieving First Complete Remission

 DHL in clinical practice who achieved CR1 following R-CHOP,
proceeding with consolidative autoSCT may be justifiable as the
result of the relatively poor survival outcomes for R-CHOP/non-
autoSCT patients demonstrated in this series.
The strengths of our study include a large sample size of pa-
tients with DHL collected from multiple academic medical centers
(which may help to minimize biases regarding autoSCT referral
patterns at individual centers), well-matched clinicopathologic
characteristics between autoSCT and non-autoSCT patients despite
the nonrandomized nature of this study, and the use of a landmark
analysis to account for variation in duration of front-line therapy.
In addition to the retrospective nature of this study, we rec-
ognize potential limitations of our study. These include a lack of
uniform testing for MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements by FISH
for all high-grade lymphoma cases at all participating centers.
However, the lack of previously reported studies of unselected
patients with DHL, as well as the fact that baseline clinicopathologic
characteristics in our cohort are similar to those of other large
retrospective series of patients with DHL identified by selective FISH
testing,5,6 suggests that outcomes in our series can be extrapolated to
the population of patients with DHL identified in routine clinical
practice. Another limitation is the lack of central review of FISH
results for MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements, as was the case
for prior multicenter studies of patients with MYC-rearranged
lymphomas.6,18 Although we are not aware of studies reporting the
interobserver reproducibility of FISH results for MYC, BCL2, and/or
BCL6 probes, prior reports do suggest high interobserver re-
producibility of FISH results for relevant genes in solid tumors.19,20
Finally, our series does not include information regarding
prognostic pathologic data for all patients, such as MYC trans-
location partner2,8,9 or concurrent MYC and BCL2 expression by
immunohistochemistry, the presence of which is associated with
a poorer prognosis in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL
treated with R-CHOP.21,22 However, it is not clear that these high-
risk pathologic features carry the same prognosis for patients with
DHL who have achieved CR1, as evidenced by the relatively high
rate of 3-year RFS and OS rates (77% and 88%, respectively) for
patients in our cohort known to harbor the MYC-IG translocation.
These pathologic features should be analyzed in subsequent studies
of patients with DHL achieving CR1.
In conclusion, survival of patients with DHL achieving CR1 is
not significantly prolonged by receipt of autoSCT, regardless of
front-line therapy received. In addition, patients receiving R-CHOP
experienced inferior 3-year RFS compared with those receiving
intensive front-line therapy. There are no prospective randomized
studies analyzing survival outcomes in patients with DHL on the
basis of receipt of autoSCT in CR1, and although CALGB/Alliance
50303 was recently reported to show no significant difference in
survival for patients with DLBCL receiving R-CHOP compared with
DA-EPOCH-R, this study will be unable to determine a survival
difference on the basis of front-line therapy received for patients
with MYC-rearranged DLBCL.23 Therefore, we believe that our
analysis provides the best available evidence to address the benefit of
autoSCT in CR1 in patients with DHL, as well as the durability of
CR1 on the basis of front-line therapy received. It also supports the
management strategy of intensive front-line therapy without con-
solidative autoSCT in CR1 for fit patients with DHL.
