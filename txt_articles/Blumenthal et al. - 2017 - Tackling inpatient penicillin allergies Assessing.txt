Abstract
Background—Reported penicillin allergy rarely reflects penicillin intolerance. Failure to address 
inpatient penicillin allergies results in more broad-spectrum antibiotic use, treatment failures, and 
adverse drug events.
Objective—We aimed to determine the optimal approach to penicillin allergies among medical 
inpatients.

 Methods—We evaluated internal medicine inpatients reporting penicillin allergy in three periods: 
(1) standard of care (SOC), (2) penicillin skin testing (ST), and (3) computerized guideline 
application with decision support (APP). The primary outcome was use of a penicillin or 
cephalosporin, comparing interventions to SOC using multivariable logistic regression.
Results—There were 625 patients: SOC 148, ST 278, and APP 199. Of 278 ST patients, 179 
(64%) were skin test eligible; 43 (24%) received testing and none were allergic. In the APP period, 
there were 292 unique website views; 112 users (38%) completed clinical decision support. While 
ST period patients did not have an increased odds of penicillin or cephalosporin use overall (aOR 
1.3 [95% CI 0.8, 2.0]), we observed a significant increased odds of penicillin or cephalosporin use 
overall in the APP period (aOR 1.8 [95% CI 1.1, 2.9]), and in a per protocol analysis of the skin 
tested subset (aOR 5.7 [95% CI 2.6, 12.5]).
Conclusions—Both the computerized guideline with decision support and penicillin skin testing 
– when completed – increased use of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics among inpatients 
reporting penicillin allergy. While the skin tested subset showed an almost 6-fold impact, the 
computerized guideline significantly increased penicillin or cephalosporin use overall nearly 2-
fold and was readily implemented.

INTRODUCTION
Penicillin allergy is reported in up to 15% of inpatients and is associated with increased use 
of alternative antibiotics, including vancomycin, clindamycin, aminoglycosides, and 
aztreonam.1–4 Compared to beta-lactam antibiotics, these drugs are less effective in some 
clinical circumstances,5–8 more toxic,4,9 more costly,10,11 and generally cover a broader 
antimicrobial spectrum. When a beta-lactam antibiotic is the preferred inpatient antibiotic, 
but not administered due to alleged allergy, patients experience more treatment failures and 
adverse events.4,8 Patients reporting penicillin allergy have increased odds of antibiotic 
resistant organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-
resistant Enterococcus.12
Despite a reported penicillin allergy, more than 95% of patients evaluated for such allergy 
are found penicillin and cephalosporin tolerant.10,12–16 Therefore, active attention to 
clarifying old and inaccurate penicillin allergies is supported by various U.S. guidelines and 
agencies as an important feature of antimicrobial stewardship.17–20 Because the optimal 
approach to the evaluation and management of inpatient penicillin allergy is unknown, yet 
impacts a substantial number of patients per year, we implemented and assessed two 
healthcare delivery system innovations to improve antibiotic choice among medical 
inpatients reporting a history of penicillin allergy.

 METHODS
Design Overview
We conducted a quasi-experimental study evaluating prospectively identified cohorts of 
internal medicine inpatients at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). We sequentially 
evaluated three strategies: (1) BWH standard of care (SOC); (2) history-appropriate 
penicillin skin testing (ST), a process-based innovation; and (3) a computerized guideline 
application with clinical decision support, a technology-based innovation (APP). We 
compared antibiotic use in the intervention periods to the SOC period. This study was 
approved by the Partners Human Research Committee.
Study Population
A daily electronic tracker identified medical inpatients with a history of penicillin allergy 
prescribed one or more doses of any antimicrobial in all periods (Fig 1). Patient 
readmissions and patients not meriting treatment of a presumed infection were excluded. 
The latter exclusion comprised patients who did not receive therapeutic antibiotics in the 
first seven days of hospitalization, and those who received < 48 hours of antibiotic therapy, 
accounting for both discharge antibiotics and amended dosing frequency associated with 
renal dosing.21
Study Periods
BWH Standard of Care (SOC)—SOC was the comparison period when no active 
intervention was performed. SOC patient data were collected from June 9, 2014 through 
November 5, 2014. As an academic, tertiary care facility, BWH has an antibiotic 
stewardship program that restricts some broad-spectrum and costly antibiotics (e.g., 
linezolid, daptomycin). BWH also has a drug allergy program with inpatient Allergy/
Immunology consultation and 24-hour on-call services. During SOC, all penicillin skin 
testing and test dose challenge22 procedures were performed only when referred by the 
primary team and deemed appropriate after Allergy/Immunology consultation (eMethods 1, 
Fig E1a).
Penicillin Skin Testing (ST)—The ST period began November 12, 2014, and continued 
through June 30, 2015. During the ST period, all tracker-identified patients were screened by 
the care redesign team for skin test eligibility. Patients ineligible for skin testing included 
patients with penicillin intolerances (e.g., gastrointestinal upset), patients taking medications 
that interfered with skin testing (e.g., antihistamines), and patients with multiple beta-lactam 
allergies, penicillin anaphylaxis in the last five years, or a type II–IV hypersensitivity 
reaction23 to penicillin. Skin testing was routinely intended for all skin test eligible patients, 
but required permission from the primary team, coordination of skin testing using a 
moonlighting pool of allergy trainees and nurses, and patient consent (eMethods 1, Fig E1b). 
Patients with both negative penicillin skin testing and tolerance of an oral amoxicillin test 
dose were deemed not allergic. The primary medical team and the patients were updated 
regarding changes in allergy status.

 Computerized Guideline Application with Clinical Decision Support (APP)—
After a five month study break due to a hospital-wide electronic health record conversion,24 
the APP period ran from November 20, 2015 through June 13, 2016 (Fig E1c). A clinical 
pathway that guided beta-lactam antibiotic use in patients with listed penicillin allergy was 
previously developed, implemented, and assessed at an academic hospital affiliate 
(eMethods 2).5,25–27 The guideline empowered inpatient providers to group allergic 
reactions into hypersensitivity type, then recommended if and how specific beta-lactam 
antibiotics be used (i.e., very low risk: full doses; low risk: test doses; medium to high risk: 
Allergy/Immunology consultation; serious type II–IV hypersensitivity reactions: avoidance).
The previously studied pathway was adapted into a computerized guideline,28,29 a mobile-
friendly website with optional clinical decision support, functionally similar to a smartphone 
application (eMethods 3). Due to the coincident electronic health record conversion at 
BWH, the computerized guideline was not integrated into the electronic health record, but 
remained a distinct clinical workflow. The guideline was accessible at any BWH desktop 
computer or mobile device on the secure intranet. Providers could access the pathway 
figures directly from the website and/or login to use clinical decision support. After decision 
support computed the patient’s likely allergic reaction type, it stratified the reaction into a 
risk category and displayed recommendations for further action (Fig E2). The website 
housed additional educational information and provider videos.
Data Collection
All patient data were collected from the electronic health record, with duplicative entry, 
initially by research assistants (NP, AEN), followed by internal medicine housestaff. Data 
were entered and maintained using Research Electronic Data Capture hosted at Partners 
HealthCare.30
Demographic Characteristics—Collected patient data included age, sex, race, 
admission date, discharge date, admission diagnosis, allergy history, intensive care unit stay 
and duration time, Infectious Diseases consultation, Allergy/Immunology consultation, 
history of colonization or infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or 
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, renal disease, and overall length of stay. Two board-
certified internists and allergists/immunologists (KGB, PGW) determined which admission 
diagnoses were related to an infection as well as which penicillin allergies were intolerances.
Intervention Uptake—In the ST period, we determined the frequency with which eligible 
patients completed skin testing. In the APP period, we tracked usage through reports from 
Google Analytics Solutions (website views) and clinical decision support responses.
Outcomes—The primary outcome was use of formulary unrestricted penicillins or 
cephalosporins (Table E2). Penicillin and cephalosporin use was identified through inpatient 
antibiotic administrations. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients 
discharged on a penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotic, inpatient use of alternative antibiotics, 
and resultant adverse drug reactions.

 Penicillins and cephalosporins on BWH formulary were included; cephalosporins were 
grouped by generation for analysis. Because of the intent to improve antibiotic choice, we 
excluded penicillins and cephalosporins historically restricted by BWH’s antibiotic 
stewardship program, including piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftaroline, ceftolozane-
tazobactam, and ceftazidime-avibactam. Alternative antibiotics included drugs that are 
potentially more toxic, less effective, more costly, and/or more broad-spectrum: vancomycin, 
clindamycin, daptomycin, linezolid, carbapenems, aztreonam, and aminoglycosides.
Balance Measure—We analyzed macrolide antibiotic utilization as a balance measure, 
given its use would not be expected to change as a result of interventions related to penicillin 
allergy evaluation.
Statistical Analysis—Study period duration and sample size were estimated in advance 
(eMethods 4). Pairwise study group comparisons were specified a priori. While the primary 
analysis between periods was an intention-to-treat analysis, we performed an additional 
secondary (per protocol) analysis for the ST period (ST-PP) to estimate the potential impact 
of this strategy if it were fully implemented. Demographic data were reported as medians 
with quartiles or as frequencies with percentages. Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare 
study groups for binary variables, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used for continuous 
variables. Racial differences among study groups were tested using the Freeman-Halton test. 
Logistic regression was used to test group differences, with unadjusted and adjusted odds 
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) presented. Selection of variables to include 
in multivariable models involved prior knowledge of association with outcome, and 
imbalance across the study duration. Nominal p-values were reported in this context of three 
a priori non-independent pair-wise group comparisons, considering 5% two-sided alpha. 
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
RESULTS
Cohort Characteristics
Of 1,000 medicine inpatients with a reported penicillin allergy prescribed one or more 
antibiotic dose, there were 780 unique patients and 625 unique patients admitted with a 
presumed infection across three periods: SOC 148, ST 278, and APP 199 (Fig 1).
Patient characteristics were largely balanced across periods, with a few exceptions (Table I). 
Compared to the SOC period, there were fewer females in the subset of patients skin tested 
(i.e., skin test per protocol analysis [ST-PP]), more patients with an admission diagnosis of 
infection in the ST and APP periods, more frequent Allergy/Immunology consultation in the 
ST period and in the ST-PP analysis, more frequent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus colonization in the ST and APP periods, and more reported cephalosporin allergies in 
the ST and APP periods.
Intervention Uptake
Among 278 patients in the ST period, 179 (64%) were skin test eligible. Of 43 (24%) 
patients skin tested, none were allergic (Fig 2). There were 2,802 webpage views in the APP

 period, with 292 unique page views lasting 26 seconds on average (Table E1). There were 
112 unique users who completed decision support.
Primary Outcome, Inpatient Penicillin or Cephalosporin Use
Of 148 patients in the SOC period, 56 (38%) were treated with a penicillin or cephalosporin 
(Table II). Of 278 patients in ST period, 116 (42%) were treated with a penicillin or 
cephalosporin antibiotic. Of 43 ST-PP patients, 31 (72%) of patients were treated with a 
penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotic. Of 199 patients in the APP period, 99 (50%) were 
treated with a penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotic; treated patients received the penicillins 
and/or cephalosporins after negative penicillin skin testing (n=5, 5%) or directly with a test 
dose or full dose challenge (n=94, 95%).
In univariable analyses compared to SOC, penicillin or cephalosporin use was similar in the 
ST period overall (p=0.44), but greater in the ST-PP analysis (p<0.001) and overall in the 
APP period (p=0.03). In the multivariable logistic regression model, patients in the ST 
period did not have a significant increased odds of receiving a penicillin or cephalosporin 
(aOR 1.3 [95% CI 0.8, 2.0], Table III). ST-PP patients had increased odds of receiving a 
penicillin or cephalosporin, with an adjusted OR 5.7 [95% CI 2.6, 12.5]. APP period patients 
had increased odds of receiving a penicillin or cephalosporin, with an adjusted OR 1.8 [95% 
CI 1.1, 2.9].
Secondary Outcomes
Although a similar proportion of patients in the ST period used a penicillin or cephalosporin 
on discharge compared to the SOC period, a greater frequency of ST-PP patients received a 
penicillin or cephalosporin on discharge compared to SOC (26% vs 16%, p=0.18, Table II). 
In the multivariable model, there was an increased odds of a penicillin or cephalosporin used 
for discharge treatment for ST-PP patients, compared to SOC (OR 2.5 [95% CI 1.04, 6.2], 
Table III). In both univariable and multivariable analyses, the frequency of discharge use of a 
penicillin or cephalosporin was similar in the APP period, compared to SOC (Tables II and 
III).
Overall frequency of alternative antibiotic use was largely similar across periods (Tables II 
and III, Bottom).
There were no adverse drug reactions identified in SOC or ST periods. One patient in the 
APP period with history of penicillin allergy developed erythema and pruritus to amoxicillin 
after a negative penicillin skin test.
Balance Measure
The frequency of inpatient macrolide antibiotic use was unchanged by the interventions, 
compared to SOC (10%), for all comparisons (ST 10%, p =0.89; ST-PP 2%, p=0.10; APP 
12%, p=0.67).

 DISCUSSION
In this study of two antibiotic stewardship innovations designed to safely increase use of 
favorable beta-lactam antibiotics in medical inpatients reporting penicillin allergy, we found 
that the allergy history-driven computerized guideline as well as completed penicillin skin 
testing significantly increased penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotic use. While skin testing 
period patients did not have increased odds of penicillin or cephalosporin use, patients in the 
computerized guideline period had a significant almost 2-fold increased odds of receiving a 
penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotic. Completed skin testing, in the per protocol analysis, 
had an almost 6-fold increased odds of receiving a penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotic.
Among inpatients treated for infections, 5–25% report an allergy to penicillin.1,4,7,16,31 
Although up to 3 in 4 patients with alleged penicillin allergy warrant inpatient treatment 
with a beta-lactam antibiotic,4 only half were receiving these antibiotics in the baseline SOC 
period. We implemented interventions that were associated with increased use of favorable 
penicillins and cephalosporins, reflecting improved antibiotic choice and stewardship. Since 
the impact of over-reporting penicillin allergy is felt beyond antibiotic utilization to resultant 
readmissions,31 treatment failures,8 and adverse events,4 safely increasing the use of 
penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics in this patient population is a crucial first step 
towards improved quality of care and reduced cost.32
We did not observe a significant impact of the interventions on the frequency of discharge 
use of penicillins or cephalosporins in the primary analyses, or inpatient use of alternative 
antibiotics. The former may be explained by providers’ choice for outpatient therapy placing 
more emphasis on medication convenience. Yet, we observed that patients who completed 
skin testing in the per protocol analysis had an increased odds of penicillin or cephalosporin 
use at discharge, which may indicate that skin test negative patients have improved antibiotic 
use beyond their hospitalization. It was not surprising that neither intervention had a 
significant impact on use of alternative antibiotics, since medical inpatients with infections 
are often given empiric treatment that includes the alternative antibiotics.
Prior studies addressing over-reported penicillin allergies have demonstrated the utility of 
penicillin skin testing in emergency, intensive care, and perioperative patients.10,13,33 Fewer 
skin testing studies are reported among highly selected inpatient subsets.16,34–36 Alternative 
approaches to address inpatient penicillin allergies have included consultation by allergy 
specialists34,37 and guidelines/clinical pathways.26,38 By implementing and assessing both a 
skin testing approach and guideline approach in sequential cohorts at the same institution, 
we were able to determine the overall hospital policy level impact of these interventions.
While completed penicillin skin testing was effective at improving inpatient antibiotic 
choice, 36% of patients were ineligible for testing, consistent with prior estimates that 
deemed 4–59% of inpatients skin test ineligible.16,39,40 One modifiable reason that patients 
in the ST period overall may not have experienced a significant increase in penicillin and 
cephalosporin use was an inability to coordinate testing for 58 skin test eligible patients. 
However, we skin tested 16% of all patients reporting penicillin allergy on antibiotics in this 
period, and 24% of those who were skin test eligible, largely comparable to the 19% yield

 achieved through the use of a designated pharmacist performing skin testing in a prior 
study.36 Still, more patients would have had testing completed, and overall findings may 
have differed, had we hired an on-site skin testing clinician.
Despite challenges associated with coincidental innovation at the time of electronic health 
record conversion,41–44 there were almost 300 unique webpage views of the computerized 
guideline, and 112 providers completed decision support. Given the computerized 
guideline’s overall positive impact on antibiotic use, reliance on new technology over new 
human capital, and relative ease of implementation, the computerized guideline and decision 
support tool have great potential to improve the care of inpatients with reported penicillin 
allergy. This conclusion is further strengthened by our knowledge of the intervention’s 
limited electronic health record integration and basic user interface during the study 
period.45,46 Further, the computerized guideline and decision support tool can provide 
guidance when hospitals do not have access to allergists or penicillin skin testing, or when 
patients are otherwise ineligible or unwilling to complete a skin test.
Innovations in healthcare delivery substantially change care, while quality improvement 
targets incremental change.47 The interventions implemented challenged the status quo by 
introducing a new process (i.e., skin testing) and a new technology (i.e., computerized 
guideline) to change the care of inpatients labeled penicillin-allergic. Healthcare systems are 
ill-equipped to address penicillin allergy because general clinicians have poor drug allergy 
knowledge,25 there are inadequate numbers of allergy specialists to perform these 
evaluations,48,49 and less than 15% of U.S. hospitals have the skin testing reagent on 
formulary.50 Thus, healthcare delivery innovations are needed with investments in 
infrastructure, technology, and/or human resources. These investments may contain elements 
of the computerized guideline, which was easy to implement and relatively inexpensive. 
Hospitals will likely need processes for performing penicillin skin testing and test dose 
challenges, even without access to allergy specialists.
While the hospital policy perspective of this study afforded us a realistic view of the overall 
impact of our interventions, the analysis underestimates the potential impact because of 
incomplete uptake. Using a per protocol analysis for the penicillin skin testing period 
provided additional insight, but is subject to selection bias towards patients who would most 
clearly benefit from the penicillin skin test. While a per protocol analysis may have been 
similarly favorable for patients whose providers used the computerized guideline, these data 
were not available. Although cohorts were identified prospectively, data were gathered 
retrospectively, potentially resulting in missing or misclassification information; for 
example, we could not identify mild adverse reactions, if they were not included in the 
electronic health record. Data were also gathered in two different electronic health record 
systems, however, variables were collected by medicine-trained chart verifiers comfortable 
with both systems. We acknowledge that our quasi-experimental design limits our ability to 
demonstrate causality, but we included the macrolide balance measure to provide 
reassurance against unmeasured confounders or secular trends. This study assessed 
antibiotic outcomes within patients’ incident admission only, and did not capture important 
longitudinal outcomes, such as clarity of allergy status/documentation or types of antibiotics 
(i.e., beta-lactams or alternatives) used after discharge or in future hospitalizations. Finally,

 internal medicine patients may not be similar to other types of inpatients (e.g., surgical, 
obstetric), and results may differ in hospitals whose patients, resources, and/or personnel 
differ from those of BWH.
In summary, we implemented and assessed two interventions in the care of hospitalized 
medical patients with reported penicillin allergy. Although barriers to completing skin 
testing routinely in medical patients made skin testing impractical and without an overall 
impact on antibiotic use, skin tested patients had almost 6-fold odds of increased penicillin 
and cephalosporin use. The computerized guideline had an overall positive, almost 2-fold 
impact, with a feasible implementation and long-term strategy for greater technology 
integration.

 Clinical Implications
Improved antibiotic choice among medical inpatients reporting prior penicillin allergy 
was achieved using a computerized guideline, which resulted in an overall significant 
increased odds of penicillin or cephalosporin use compared to standard of care (aOR 1.8 
[95% CI 1.1, 2.9]).

This flow chart demonstrates patient cohort identification. The care redesign team was 
notified prospectively if patients met initial criteria, including (1) internal medicine 
inpatient, (2) reported penicillin allergy, and (3) prescribed one or more antibiotic doses. 
From this cohort, we excluded readmissions and patients whose admission was not for 
treatment of an infection. Of 625 patients meeting these criteria, 148 were admitted in the 
standard of care period, 278 were admitted in the penicillin skin testing period, and 199 were 
admitted in the computerized guideline period.
