Abstract
Background: Cluster headache (CH) is a disabling primary headache disorder characterized by severe
periorbital pain. A subset of patients does not respond to established pharmacological therapy. This study
examines outcomes of a cohort of mainly chronic CH patients treated with sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG)
stimulation.
Methods: Patients were followed in an open-label prospective study for 12 months. Ninety-seven CH patients
(88 chronic, 9 episodic) underwent trans-oral insertion of a microstimulator targeting the SPG. Patients
recorded stimulation effect prospectively for individual attacks. Frequency, use of preventive and acute
medications, headache impact (HIT-6) and quality of life measures (SF-36v2) were monitored at clinic visits.
Per protocol, frequency responders experienced ≥ 50% reduction in attack frequency and acute responders
treated ≥ 50% of attacks. HIT-6 responders experienced an improvement ≥ 2.3 units and SF-36 responders ≥
4 units vs. baseline.
Results: Eighty-five patients (78 chronic, 7 episodic) remained implanted and were evaluated for effectiveness
at 12 months. In total, 68% of all patients were responders, 55% of chronic patients were frequency
responders and 32% of all patients were acute responders. 67% of patients using acute treatments were able
to reduce the use of these by 52% and 74% of chronic patients were able to stop, reduce or remain off all
preventive medications. 59% of all patients were HIT-6 responders, 67% were SF-36 responders.
Conclusions: This open-label registry corroborates that SPG stimulation is an effective therapy for CH patients
providing therapeutic benefits and improvements in use of medication as well as headache impact and
quality of life.

Background
Cluster headache (CH) is a primary headache manifest-
ing as unilateral attacks of severe pain with increased
cranial parasympathetic outflow lasting 15–180 min [1].
Attacks may occur up to eight times per day and it has
been described as one of the most painful sensations
humans can experience. CH exists as episodic CH
(eCH), where attacks occur in clusters lasting weeks-
months separated by attack-free intervals > 1 month,
and chronic CH (cCH) with no periods of remission last-
ing > 1 month for > 1 year. Around 85% of patients suf-
fer from the episodic form but CH is by no means a
static condition and patients may transition between the
two forms. There are no known differences in patho-
physiology and in both eCH and cCH impairment is
high with reduced quality of life [2] and high direct and
indirect costs [3].
Traditional treatment can be divided into acute and
preventive strategies. Acute therapies consist of oxygen

 and injectable or nasal triptans taken as early as possible
during the individual attacks. Preventive therapies are
taken daily during the cluster period, or in cCH continu-
ously, and consist of verapamil or lithium [4]. With up
to eight attacks/day use of acute medications may ex-
ceed recommendations, and often doses of preventive
medications higher than recommended are necessary,
increasing the risk of side-effects [5]. To complicate
management
further,
around
1%
of
patients
are
medically
refractory
[6].
Invasive
neurostimulation,
including deep brain and occipital nerve stimulation,
is usually reserved for these patients. Consequently,
the literature consists of reports of relatively small
populations [7].
It is desirable to develop targeted treatments with no
systemic side effects and no safety issues with repeated use.
Sphenopalatine
ganglion
(SPG)
stimulation
using
an
implantable microstimulater (Pulsante™) has been evaluated
in a randomized, controlled trial where 68% were thera-
peutic responders [8]. These results were subsequently
confirmed in a 24-month follow-up study [9, 10].
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of
SPG stimulation through 12 months in an open label set-
ting, in a large population including cCH and a limited
number of eCH patients. As opposed to the previously
mentioned forms of neurostimulation, ONS and DBS,
SPG stimulation elicits both an acute and preventive effect
which this study was specifically designed to capture.
Methods
The Pathway R-1 registry study is a post-market registry of
the Pulsante™ SPG Microstimulator System (Autonomic
Technologies, Inc., Redwood City, California, USA) to con-
firm safety and long-term effectiveness of SPG stimulation
in a large population, where patients underwent trans-oral
insertion of this SPG microstimulator [11, 12].
Patient selection
Selection criteria for this registry were patients who met CH
criteria per CE -labeling for the Pulsante Microstimulation
System. Patients should have cluster headaches for a mini-
mum of 16 weeks (investigator opinion) and the ability to
provide written informed consent. Exclusion criteria in-
cluded changes in preventive medication in the month
prior to enrollment and patients who have bony facial
deformities, inappropriate surgical anatomy or have had
facial surgery that would prevent the proper placement of
the Pulsante Microstimulator. Given that previous studies
established a good safety profile it was not a requirement
that patients were medically refractory per established
criteria [6], however, most had tried several or all pharma-
ceutical options and were considered difficult to treat with
a high headache burden.
SPG microstimulator system
The SPG Microstimulator System is designed to fit in
the facial anatomy with an integrated lead placed prox-
imate to the SPG. The microstimulator communicates
with a handheld remote control by radio-waves, is
inductively powered and contains no battery. Using the
remote control, patients apply on-demand SPG stimula-
tion to treat individual cluster attacks and were advised
to treat these for at least 15 min as soon as they were
felt. Patients were also permitted to use SPG stimulation
prophylactically without any sense of an impending or
ongoing attack.
Data collection
Response to SPG stimulation during each treated attack
was collected prospectively in an electronic headache
diary incorporated into the remote control. Pain scores
were reported using the Categorical Pain Scale (CPS;
0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = very
severe). Headache pain was reported just prior to
stimulation use and headache pain and acute medica-
tion were reported immediately following stimulation.
Average attack frequency, laterality and acute and pre-
ventive medication use were collected retrospectively at
each clinic visit, with patients asked to recall their attack
frequency and acute medication usage over the prior
4 week period. Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) and Short
Form Health Survey (SF-36v2) questionnaires were com-
pleted at baseline and quarterly during the first year. Fol-
lowing microstimulator insertion, a patient experience
questionnaire was completed quarterly. Adverse events
were collected throughout the study.
Outcomes and analyses
Per protocol analyses included percent change in attack
frequency, percent of attacks achieving effective therapy,
the number of patients achieving acute and/or frequency
effect, changes in acute and preventive medication,
characterization of HIT-6 headache disability and SF-
36v2 quality of life and patient evaluation of therapy
using the patient experience questionnaire. Due to the
different nature of eCH and cCH additional frequency
analyses were performed separately for chronic and epi-
sodic patients. Surgical outcomes, including insertion of
the microstimulator within the pterygopalatine fossa, ex-
plants and lead revision rates were collected.
Change in the frequency of attacks was analyzed as
the change in attack frequency from baseline (4 weeks
prior to enrollment) to the 12 month visit (4 weeks prior
to the 12 month visit) where Frequency Responders ex-
perienced at least a 50% reduction.
Analysis of the acute response included all attacks
where SPG stimulation was applied and for which the
patient entered diary responses through the 12 month

 study visit. An Acute Responder is a patient able to
achieve effective therapy in at least 50% of attacks.
Acute effective therapy was defined in the protocol as
pain relief (decrease in categorical pain scale (CPS) from
2 (moderate) or higher to 1 (mild) or 0 (none)) without
the use of acute medications or pain freedom (decrease
in CPS from 1 (mild) or higher to 0 (none)) without the
use of acute medications as evaluated immediately fol-
lowing the cessation of SPG stimulation.
Furthermore, therapeutic responders were defined as
patients who were either acute responders, frequency re-
sponders, or both. An additional post hoc analysis was
performed to evaluate therapeutic response at the 75%
and 30% levels.
Change in acute medication use compared to baseline
was calculated for all acute medication uses (average num-
ber of uses per week), as well as separately for triptans and
oxygen. Preventive medication changes were characterized
to identify patients who stopped, decreased dose, remained
off, or added/increased doses of preventive medications.
Headache impact improvements were considered clinic-
ally meaningful when scores improved by at least 2.3 units
relative to baseline [13]. Quality of life improvements were
considered clinically meaningful if either the physical
(PCS) or mental component score (MCS) improved by at
least 4 units relative to baseline [14]. Responses to a patient
experience questionnaire were characterized. In 8 patients,
who missed their 12 month study visit, any missing data
for frequency, medication, or questionnaire data were im-
puted from the preceding 9 month study visit. HIT-6 data
was incomplete in 5 patients and 6 patients had incomplete
SF-36v2 data. These were omitted from the respective ana-
lyses. With regards to study visits and duration, 28 days
were considered a month. Some patients completed their
3, 6 or 12 month visit earlier or later than scheduled (see
results) based on the protocol defined visit schedule and
visit windows.
Statistics
For
all
quantitative
comparisons
against
baseline
(frequency, acute medication, headache disability, quality
of life) a paired t-test was used to account for changes
over time with p < 0.05 regarded as statistically signifi-
cant. Results for stimulation usage for acute cluster
headache pain, were analyzed using a generalized esti-
mating equation with least squares means. Changes in
use of medication were calculated as absolute changes
using Wilcoxon signed ranks.
Results
Patient disposition, clinical characteristics, and surgical
outcomes
Ninety-seven CH patients (88 chronic, 9 episodic) were en-
rolled at 12 centers (Germany: 10, Denmark: 1, Austria: 1)
and underwent microstimulator insertion from September
2012 through March 2015 (Fig. 1, Table 1). None of these
patients were included in previous studies of SPG stimula-
tion. Four patients were not able to be implanted during
the initial attempt, however two of the four underwent an
additional insertion attempt and a microstimulator was
successfully placed within the pterygopalatine fossa. Twelve
patients did not complete the study through to the
12 month visit (Fig. 1). Two of these have some efficacy
data available indicating non-response to therapy. The
remaining 85 patients (78 chronic, 7 episodic) continued
through the study to 12 months and are included in the
present 12 month evaluation of effectiveness (average time
from microstimulator insertion to 12 month study visit:
368 ± 42 days (range 245–475)). Of the 85 patients in-
cluded in the final analysis at 12 months, 8 underwent lead
repositioning prior to the 12 month time point. Seven of
these were repositioned on the same day as the original
surgery as post-op CT showed misplacement. The eighth
patient was explanted 3 months after the original surgery
and re-implanted 9 months later as lead placement was
deemed to be suboptimal. Three patients (1 episodic, 2
chronic) had a frequency of 0 attacks/week at baseline.
These patients were still implanted as they were very well
characterized clinically, had CH for many years and logis-
tics did not allow postponement.
Attack frequency, chronic patients
Fifty-five per-cent (43/78) of the cCH patients were fre-
quency responders, defined as experiencing at least a
50% reduction in attack frequency. For these, frequency
was significantly reduced at 12 months compared to
baseline (Table 2).
In the 78 chronic patients evaluated, 23 (29%) reported
no attacks at the 12 month visit. For these cCH patients
experiencing no attacks, the preventive effect manifested
150 ± 102 (range 8–390) days after microstimulator
insertion. In all chronic patients, the average frequency
at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months was
14.9 ± 17.6, 14.9 ± 18.9, 14.2 ± 17.4 and 14.9 ± 18.1, re-
spectively. At the 12 M visit 9 cCH patients experienced
an increase in frequency of ≥ 50%.
Transitional therapies (oral steroids and greater oc-
cipital nerve (GON) blocks) were permitted at any
time. Three of the 48 frequency responders (6%) re-
ceived transitional therapies between microstimulator
insertion and the 12 month visit. One patient received
oral steroids at the 12 month visit, another had a
GON block at 7 months post baseline, and a third a
GON block 1½ months after microstimulator inser-
tion. Of the frequency non-responders, six (16%) re-
ceived GON blocks (0–6 months before 12 month
visit), and two received oral steroids (6 and 9 months
before 12 month visit).

 Acute effectiveness, episodic and chronic patients
Among all 85 patients, 13,600 attacks were treated with
acute SPG stimulation (average 160 ± 245, median 82,
range 0–1424 attacks per patient). Per protocol, 39%
(5304/13600) of these attacks were effectively treated
with SPG stimulation, with 26% (3534/13600) achieving
pain freedom (Additional file 1: Figure S1). 32% (27/85)
of patients were acute responders achieving effective
therapy in at least 50% of their attacks. These acute re-
sponders were able to effectively treat 86% (4157/4811)
of their attacks, with 57% (2750/4811) achieving pain
freedom. Average SPG stimulation application for acute
pain was 16.9 ± 12.1 min (0.02–127.3 min). Stimulation
duration was not statistically different between attacks
achieving effective therapy and those not (18.9 ± 15.7
and 15.7 ± 8.8 min, respectively, p = 0.5024).
Therapeutic endpoints, chronic patients
As described above, patients using SPG stimulation ex-
perience both acute and frequency effects, and thera-
peutic response was therefore defined as experiencing
either acute and/or frequency response. In the chronic
patients, 65% (51/78) were considered responders per
protocol (achieving effective therapy in at least 50% of
attacks or experiencing a 50% reduction in attack fre-
quency or both). Seventeen patients (20%) experienced
both an acute and frequency response per the protocol.
Nearly half of the chronic patients (47% (37/78)) experi-
enced a very strong ≥ 75% response to SPG stimulation.
74% (58/78) of patients experienced at least a 30% thera-
peutic response.
Acute and preventive medication use
Ninety-seven percent (82/85) of patients used acute
treatments (triptans and/or oxygen) at baseline. All acute
treatments were reduced by 52% from 22.0 ± 21.3 to
10.6 ± 17.6 uses/week (p < 0.0001, n = 82), triptan usage
was reduced by 57% from 11.3 ± 13.3 to 5.0 ± 9.9 uses/
week (p < 0.0001, n = 82), and oxygen usage was reduced
by 54% from 9.8 ± 15.4 to 4.5 ± 11.3 uses/week (p = 0.0024,
n = 84) (Fig. 2). Among those using acute medications at
baseline, 67% (52/78) reduced all acute treatments, 87%
(59/68) reduced triptan use, and 79% (34/43) reduced oxy-
gen use by ≥50% compared to baseline.
At 12 months, for chronic patients only, improvements
in preventive medication use were noted in 74% (58/78)
with 18 stopping all, 19 stopping some and/or decreasing
the dose of others, 20 remaining off all, and 1 experiencing
a clinical improvement (per clinical judgment) in prevent-
ive medication use at 12 months versus baseline.
Episodic cluster headache patient outcomes
Seven patients with eCH were followed through the
study and per protocol, two were acute responders. This
study is not ideally suited to evaluate the frequency
response in eCH patients, however, per protocol, 5 of

 these were frequency responders. These eCH patients
also saw improvements in quality of life and headache
impairment similar to chronic patients: HIT-6 baseline:

baseline: 29.7 ± 8.4, 12 months: 40.4 ± 13.2.
Headache disability, quality of life, and patient surveys
Fifty-nine percent (47/80) of all the patients that com-
pleted HIT-6 at baseline, and 74% (39/53) of therapeutic
responders were HIT-6 responders, experiencing a re-
duction in headache disability of at least 2.3 points. 67%
(53/79) of all the patients that completed the SF-36, and
73% (38/52) of therapeutic responders, were SF-36v2 re-
sponders, experiencing an improvement in PCS, MCS,
or both in the SF-36v2 survey. In addition, HIT-6, SF-
36v2 PCS, and SF-36v2 MCS scores were significantly
improved at 12 months compared to baseline (Table 3).
Seventy percent (56/80) of all patients who completed
the questionnaire and 86% (48/56) of therapeutic re-
sponders rated the Pulsante™ system as good or very
good. 81% considered the sensation of stimulation toler-
able, 83% found the inserted device comfortable or did
not feel it, 81% found surgery effects tolerable, 86%
would recommend the therapy to someone else, 80%
would make the same decision again, and 76% found
SPG stimulation useful for treating their attacks.
Safety
The occurrence of side-effects in this population was simi-
lar to previously published data [12] on this issue, which
typically included sensory disturbances, post-operative
pain and swelling (Additional file 2: Table S1). Briefly, 73%
of patients experienced such postoperative sequelae and
these were generally considered mild to moderate and re-
solved within 2–3 months (average: 68 days for resolved

after correct placement. There were no cases of lead frac-
ture. Eight patients underwent lead revision after initial
insertion due to suboptimal electrode placement.
Discussion
In this prospective study of 85 eCH and cCH patients
treated with an implantable neurostimulator, we have
demonstrated the effectiveness of SPG stimulation for
attack frequency reductions and acute pain relief. At
12 months 55% of chronic patients were frequency re-
sponders and 32% of all patients were acute responders.
At the per protocol defined level of ≥50%, 68% of all pa-
tients were therapeutic responders to SPG stimulation.
67% (52/78) of patients were able to reduce the use of
acute medications by at least 50% and clinical improve-
ments in the use of preventive medications were ob-
served in 74% of patients. These clinical improvements
were reflected in improved headache disability in 59% of
all patients and 74% of responders.
Compared to deep brain stimulation and occipital
nerve stimulation, SPG stimulation elicits both acute
and preventive responses as supported by the reduction
of both acute and preventive treatments in this popula-
tion. Other studies in chronic headache have employed a
responder level of 30% [15, 16]. If such a responder level
were applied to this population, 76% of patients would
be considered responders. However, some problems re-
main. For example, how the preventive response should
be interpreted, given the possibility of spontaneous fluc-
tuations [17]. The response to SPG stimulation appears
stable over time as demonstrated in a previous 24 month
study [9]. However, the difficulty in interpreting this re-
sponse is underlined by results in the cCH group where
the majority experienced reductions in frequency but a
small subset did see an increase in the number of attacks
compared to baseline. Further, in episodic CH, the fre-
quency response cannot be solely attributed to treatment
as the bout may be ending of its own accord. Longer
baseline prospective attack diaries may be helpful in this
regard, but given the dreadfulness of the disease, are
impracticable and indeed unethical as it could delay
effective treatment.
Overall, the data presented here is very similar to pre-
viously published results of SPG stimulation [8–10] with
one exception: The proportion of acute uses of the
stimulator achieving effective therapy was lower than
previously reported (39% vs. 65%). This difference may
be attributed to acute non-responders choosing the SPG
stimulator over other acute treatments, despite it not be-
ing effective in them. This hypothesis may be supported
by the fact that in the acute responders, the number of
acute uses achieving effective therapy was similar in this
study to that previously reported (86% vs. 78%, respect-
ively). SPG stimulation is uniquely useful to CH patients
as it is not associated with the daily limit in the number
of uses as triptans which is especially important to pa-
tients with more than 2 daily attacks. Nor does it have
the impracticality and stigmatization of oxygen, espe-
cially in the context of maintaining a professional life.
Given that the use of acute medication is significantly
reduced using SPG stimulation, this method also has an
economical advantage [18].
As stated, SPG stimulation provides acute relief in
some, a preventive effect in others, or both. This makes
characterizing the efficacy challenging as reflected in
previous studies [8, 9] where the preventive effect was
unanticipated. However, this registry study was specific-
ally designed to capture both signals. In the highly dy-
namic field of neurostimulation no official guidelines
exist and there are only very few long-term neuromodu-
lation studies of relatively small populations of CH pa-
tients. It should be noted that for want of a specific CH
tool for measuring headache impact, the HIT-6, vali-
dated for migraine, was used. Although interventions
with steroids were allowed per protocol, we believe these
to have played a minor part in the overall results as only
3 of the 48 frequency responders were treated in this
manner. A recall bias cannot be excluded, as the attack
frequency was self-reported retrospectively at each study
visit. Also, while a frequency effect is apparent, the effect
of preventive simulation, i.e. stimulating without pain, is
still unknown. At current, no positive or negative predic-
tors for efficacy of SPG stimulation have been identified
therefore patients with no immediate acute effect should
keep stimulating as a preventive effect may manifest at a

 later point. An obvious possibility may be an influence
of highly variant facial anatomy; however, other mecha-
nisms should not be excluded. Additionally, stimulation
duration and timing may play a role and future studies
should investigate this and possible predictive factors.
Conclusion
In conclusion, SPG stimulation is an effective treatment for
CH patients reducing their need for medications and im-
proving quality of life and reducing headache impairment.
