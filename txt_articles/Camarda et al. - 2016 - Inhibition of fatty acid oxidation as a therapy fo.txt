Abstract
Expression of the oncogenic transcription factor MYC is disproportionately elevated in triple-
negative breast cancer (TNBC) compared to estrogen, progesterone and human epidermal growth 
factor 2 receptor-positive (RP) breast tumors1,2. We and others have shown that MYC alters 
metabolism during tumorigenesis3,4. However, the role of MYC in TNBC metabolism remains

 largely unexplored. We hypothesized that MYC-dependent metabolic dysregulation is essential for 
MYC-overexpressing (MO) TNBC and may thus identify novel therapeutic targets for this 
clinically challenging subset of breast cancer. Using a targeted metabolomics approach, we 
identified fatty acid oxidation (FAO) intermediates as being dramatically upregulated in a MYC-
driven model of TNBC. A lipid metabolism gene signature was identified in patients with TNBC 
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and multiple other clinical datasets, implicating 
FAO as a dysregulated pathway critical for TNBC metabolism. We find that MO-TNBC displays 
increased bioenergetic reliance upon fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and that pharmacologic inhibition 
of FAO catastrophically decreases energy metabolism of MO-TNBC, blocks growth of a MYC-
driven transgenic TNBC model and that of MO-TNBC patient-derived xenografts. Our results 
demonstrate that inhibition of FAO is a novel therapeutic strategy against MO-TNBC.
We hypothesized that MYC-dependent metabolic dysregulation is essential for MO-TNBC. 
To test this hypothesis, we investigated the metabolism of a conditional doxycycline-
inducible transgenic model of MO-TNBC (MTB-TOM)5,6. We utilized mass spectrometry 
to compare the global metabolic profile of MTB-TOM tumors to naïve transgenic mammary 
glands in which MYC was not induced. Metabolite analysis revealed a number of 
dysregulated pathways in MTB-TOM tumors commonly associated with tumorigenesis 
including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and fatty acid metabolism (Fig. 1a, 
Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 1). Although fatty acid synthesis (FAS) is upregulated in 
many types of cancer, a MYC-dependent role for FAO in breast tumorigenesis has not been 
described4,7,8. Considering the proximity of primary breast tumors to the adipose-rich 
mammary gland, we chose to focus on the dysregulation of FAO in MO-TNBC.
To investigate the role of MYC in TNBC FAO upregulation, we returned to our MTB-TOM 
metabolomic data (Supplementary Table 1). Acyl-carnitines (AC) are an essential 
intermediate and the first committed step of FAO9. To catabolize long-chain fatty acids such 
as palmitate to acetyl-CoA, a major fuel for biosynthetic and bioenergetic metabolism, acyl-
CoAs must be converted to acyl-carnitines across the outer mitochondrial membrane by 
carnitine-palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1)9. Within our metabolomic data, we found that all 
six acyl-carnitine (AC) intermediates detected were significantly elevated in MTB-TOM 
tumors compared to control tissue (Fig. 1b). To further validate our steady-state findings in 
vivo, we assayed AC production in MTB-TOM tumors 4 hours (h) following intraperitoneal 
(IP) injection of 13C-palmitate into tumor-bearing mice. We found that tumor tissue had a 
four-fold increase in 13C-palmitoyl-carnitine production compared to control mammary 
gland (Fig. 1c). This experiment was not normalized by overall uptake, and thus, may reflect 
a relative increase in FA uptake, FA utilization via oxidation or both. Nevertheless, these 
data overall indicate that the first committed step of FAO is upregulated in MO-TNBC.
To determine how FAO is altered in TNBC, we analyzed RNA-expression data from primary 
human tumors (TCGA, 771 patients). Of 336 genes associated with fatty acid metabolism by 
the Gene Ontology database (GO:0006631), we found that 244 (73%) were significantly 
dysregulated (FDR < 0.05) in TN versus RP tumors (Supplementary Table 2). We found that 
TN tumors displayed upregulation of many activators of FAO, including the master 
transcriptional regulator PGC1α, and downregulation of many activators of fatty acid

 synthesis (FAS), including FASN and ACACB (ACC2) (Supplementary Table 2). We 
applied the fatty acid metabolism signature identified from the TCGA samples (Fig. 2a) to 
four additional breast cancer clinical cohorts (2,119 total patients including TCGA) and 
confirmed that it was highly correlated with TN tumor samples (Supplementary Fig. 2 and 
Table 3)10–13. We confirmed upregulation of key FAO activators and downregulation of key 
fatty acid synthesis activators at the protein level in TN versus RP human breast cancer cell 
lines (Fig. 2b)4,14,15. Interestingly, while FASN and ACC2 were markedly downregulated in 
TN cell lines compared to RP cells, ACC1 is expressed in both TN and RP cell lines. To 
directly test if FAO was increased in MYChigh TNBC we measured 14C-oleic acid 
conversion to 14CO2. We found a ~50% increase in FAO in TN MYChigh cells compared to 
TN MYClow and RP cells (Fig. 2c). Taken together these data suggest FAO is upregulated in 
MYChigh TNBC, while FAS, if maintained, may occur preferentially through ACC1 activity 
rather than ACC2.
TN is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer and is characterized by poor clinical 
outcome1,2. To determine if FAO gene expression is associated with prognosis, we 
performed univariate analysis of the 336 fatty acid metabolism genes on a patient cohort 
with long-term distant recurrence-free survival data (Supplementary Table 4)11. We found 
that decreased ACACB (ACC2), a critical FAS gene, that produces malonyl-CoA to directly 
inhibit CPT1 and therefore FAO, was associated with worse prognosis in all patients, as well 
as within a TN cohort (Fig. 2d)9. While diminished ACACB was also associated with worse 
outcome for patients with RP tumors, median distant recurrence-free survival was not 
reached in this cohort (Fig. 2d). These data suggest that decreased ACC2 and thus increased 
FAO directly contribute to the aggressiveness of breast tumors, with worst outcome found 
amongst the TN cohort.
FAO is the primary bioenergetic pathway in many non-tumor tissues9. We therefore 
investigated if this pathway is essential for energy production in MO-TNBC. We used 
etomoxir, a clinically tested specific inhibitor of CPT116, to determine the effects of FAO 
inhibition on ATP or NAD(P)H production. We first examined nine human breast cancer cell 
lines (six TN, three RP) with various levels of MYC expression15. Etomoxir treatment 
dramatically inhibited ATP production in TNBC cell lines expressing high MYC, while low 
MYC TN and RP cell lines were significantly less affected (Fig. 3a,f). Analysis of 
proliferation and apoptosis revealed that etomoxir-treated MYChigh cells displayed 
decreased proliferation without a decrease in viability (Supplementary Fig. 3).
To validate the requirement for FAO in MO-TNBC with an orthogonal approach, we 
extracted data specific to the knockdown of CPT1 (isoform B) from the Project Achilles 
dataset17. We focused specifically on an independent set of breast cancer cell lines and 
categorized them as RP, TN MYClow and TN MYChigh as in Fig. 3a. We found that the 
growth of TN MYChigh cell lines was significantly more sensitive to CPT1B knockdown 
than that of RP or TN MYClow cells (Fig 3b). Additionally, we utilized siRNA to deplete 
CPT2, a different essential FAO enzyme9. CPT2 knockdown markedly decreased 
proliferation of MYChigh TN cell lines, but had a significantly reduced effect on the growth 
of RP lines (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 4). Thus, small molecule inhibition and

 knockdown of CPT1, as well as knockdown of CPT2 suggest FAO is an essential metabolic 
pathway in MO-TNBC.
FAO has been shown to be important during matrix detachment and under nutrient-deprived 
conditions18,19. We asked whether TN and MYC status affected responses to FAO inhibition 
when tumor cells are not attached or deprived of glucose. We utilized ultra-low adhesion 
plates and grew breast cancer cell lines as spheres to model matrix detachment. While TN 
MYChigh, TN MYClow and RP cells were all able to form viable spheres upon matrix 
detachment, the TN MYChigh cells were significantly more sensitive to FAO inhibition 
(Supplementary Fig. 5). Next, we tested the additive effect of FAO inhibition and glucose 
deprivation. Both TN MYChigh and TN MYClow cells display increased sensitivity to 
glucose deprivation, consistent with a well-established dependence on glycolysis for TNBC 
growth. Depleting glucose and inhibiting FAO results in additive ATP depletion in TN but 
not in RP cells (Supplementary Fig. 6). This is consistent with previous findings that FAO is 
important for breast cancer cell survival and NADPH production when glycolysis is 
limited20. Although FAO is important during matrix detachment and nutrient-deprivation, 
data presented in this study suggest TN MYChigh cells are uniquely more reliant upon FAO 
in both contexts.
To confirm the bioenergetic reliance upon FAO in MO-TNBC is a MYC-dependent 
phenotype, we examined if conditional MYC expression could alter sensitivity to FAO 
inhibition. We employed two distinct approaches: non-tumor human mammary epithelial 
cells expressing a four-hydroxytamoxifen (TAM)-inducible MYC-ER fusion protein 
(HMECMYC-ER) and two RP lines stably transduced with a MYC overexpression construct 
or control vector1,15 (Supplementary Fig. 7). We found that TAM-induced HMECMYC-ER 
and MYC-transduced RP cells were significantly more sensitive to etomoxir than uninduced 
HMECMYC-ER and vector-transduced RP cells, respectively (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, siRNA-
mediated knockdown of MYC significantly rescued etomoxir sensitivity in three of four 
MYChigh TNBC cell lines (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 8). Finally, MYC protein 
expression was significantly correlated with bioenergetic sensitivity to FAO inhibition across 
our panel of human breast cell lines (Fig. 3f). While MYC expression is not tightly 
correlated with FAO or FAS protein expression (Figs. 2b and 3g), it is well correlated with 
FAO inhibition sensitivity and FAO activity (Figs. 2c and 3g). These data suggest MYC 
expression is both necessary and sufficient to induce a bioenergetic reliance upon FAO in 
breast epithelial cells.
Given that our initial observation of dysregulated FAO was made in MYC-driven breast 
tumors, we sought to test the effects of FAO inhibition on MO-TNBC metabolism in vivo. 
We administered 60 mg per kg of body weight (mg/kg) etomoxir or vehicle by IP injection 
at t = 0 h and 24 h to a cohort of mice bearing orthotopic HCI-002 MYChigh TNBC patient-
derived xenografts (PDX) (Fig. 4a)21. Metabolite analysis of tumors harvested at 26 h 
revealed a significant reduction in long-chain AC levels as well as a reduction in TCA cycle 
intermediates, especially α-ketoglutarate, in drug-treated tumors compared to vehicle-treated 
tumors (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 5). Phosphorylation of AMPK (pAMPK) is a 
well-established marker of bioenergetic stress. We found that etomoxir-treated tumors had a 
significant increase in pAMPK compared to control-treated tumors (Fig. 4c). Further, we

 conducted a second metabolomic study comparing MTB-TOM tumors treated with 20 
mg/kg for 14 days (d) to untreated tumors. Our analysis of tumors treated for 14 d 
corroborated our 26 h data as etomoxir-treated tumors displayed a significant reduction in 
the majority of TCA cycle intermediates, as well as ATP, and a significant increase in AMP/
ATP, ADP/ATP, UMP/UTP and UDP/UTP ratios (Supplementary Fig. 9 and Table 6). These 
data indicate that treatment with an FAO inhibitor decreases bioenergetic metabolism in vivo 
in both transgenic and PDX models of TNBC.
The observed reduction in bioenergetic metabolism prompted us to analyze the effects of 
prolonged FAO inhibition on the growth of MO-TNBC tumors. We performed orthotopic 
transfer of MTB-TOM or HCI-002 PDX tumors into the mammary fat pad of FVB/N or 
NOD/SCID mice, respectively. We administered 40 mg/kg etomoxir or vehicle by IP 
injection daily for 14 d to MTB-TOM allograft-bearing mice. We administered 40 or 60 
mg/kg etomoxir or vehicle by IP injection daily for 21 d to HCI-002 PDX-bearing mice. 
Etomoxir treatment resulted in significant attenuation of tumor growth in both models, and a 
significant extension of the time to ethical endpoint in the PDX model (Fig. 4d,e). In 
contrast, we observed no significant attenuation in tumor growth of the HCI-009 MYClow 
TNBC PDX tumors treated with 40 mg/kg etomoxir (Fig. 4a,f). The MYClow TNBC PDX 
tumors (HCI-009) were found to have moderate ACC2 expression indicating that FAO may 
be attenuated in these tumors (Fig 4a), explaining their resistance to etomoxir. Thus, both 
MYChigh transgenic and PDX models, but not a MYClow PDX model, demonstrate in vivo 
efficacy of etomoxir treatment and low ACC2 expression may serve as a biomarker of 
sensitivity.
Ki-67 is a well-established marker of proliferation. We found that PDX tumors treated with 
60 mg/kg etomoxir had significantly decreased Ki-67 staining (Fig. 4g). We next sought to 
determine if cell death was increased in PDX tumors treated with etomoxir. We found a 
dose-dependent increase in TUNEL staining in etomoxir-treated tumors compared to 
controls (Fig. 4g). Although etomoxir treatment of cultured MO-TNBC cell lines had a 
marked effect on cell proliferation without appreciable changes in cell death (Supplementary 
Fig. 3), in vivo FAO inhibition resulted in a concurrent decrease in proliferation and an 
increase in apoptosis of MO-TNBC (Fig. 4g). These results are consistent with FAO playing 
a more critical role for in vivo tumor development.
Elevated MYC expression was recently discovered to be a defining factor of TNBC1,2. The 
present study is amongst the first to investigate the role of MYC in TNBC metabolism in 
vivo. Here we show that MO-TNBC upregulates FAO, that TNBC is sensitive to FAO 
inhibition in a MYC-dependent manner, and that FAO inhibition abrogates growth of distinct 
models of MO-TNBC in vitro and in vivo. This work supports a critical role for FAO in 
TNBC7,8, and identifies a dependency on MYC as a marker for this phenotype. Inhibition of 
FAO demands further investigation as a therapeutic strategy for MO-TNBC.

  ONLINE METHODS
 TB-TOM tumor generation
All protocols described in this and other sections regarding animal studies were approved by 
the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. MTB-TOM (MMTV-rtTA/TetO-
MYC) were generated as previously described5. Mice were bred and maintained off 
doxycycline. At 12–15 weeks of age female mice were put on doxycycline (200 mg/kg doxy 
chow, Bio-Serv) to induce MYC expression and tumorigenesis. Mice were monitored daily 
for tumor growth by inspection and caliper measurement in two dimensions. Mice were 
sacrificed as per ethical guidelines (tumors reaching 2 cm in any single dimension) and 
tumor(s) or mammary gland(s) were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
 Metabolomics
For U-13C-palmitate flux analyses, the labeled palmitate (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories 
Inc, CLM-409-0.5) or unlabeled palmitate (Sigma) diluted in PEG40 (Spectrum) via 
sonication was administered via intraperitoneal injection at 100 mg/kg. 4 h after injection, 
animals were sacrificed and tumors were flash frozen.
Nonpolar metabolites were extracted using Dounce homogenizers in 4 mL of 2:1:1 
chloroform:methanol:PBS spiked with 10 nmol of internal standards (C12:0 dodecylglycerol 
and pentadecanoic acid, Sigma). Separation of organic and aqueous layers was achieved via 
centrifugation at 1000g for 5 minutes at 4 °C. Secondary extraction of the aqueous layer was 
performed using 0.1% formic acid followed by addition of 2 mL chloroform and further 
centrifugation. After combining the organic extractions, the lipid-containing mixture was 
dried under N2 and dissolved in 120 uL chloroform. Single-reaction monitoring (SRM) LC-
MS/MS on an Agilent 6400 series QQQ using 10 uL of sample was achieved using a 
reverse-phase C5 column (Phenomenex, Luna 50mm × 4.6mm, 5um particle diameter). 
Mobile phases: Buffer A composed of 95:5 water:methanol and buffer B 60:35:5 2-
propanol:methanol:water. Solvent modifiers were 0.1% formic acid with 5 mM ammonium 
formate or 0.1% ammonium hydroxide for positive and negative ionization modes, 
respectively.
For polar metabolites, frozen tissue was homogenized using a TissueLyser in 300 µl of 
40:40:20 acetonitrile:methanol:water with the addition of 1 nM final concentration of 
D3-15N serine as an internal extraction standard (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories Inc, 
DNLM-6863). 10 µl of cleared supernatant (via centrifugation at 15,000 rpm, 10 minutes, at 
4 °C) was used for SRM-LC-MS/MS using a normal-phase Luna NH2 column 
(Phenomenex). Mobile phases: Buffer A composed of 100% acetonitrile, buffer B composed 
of 95:5 water:acetonitrile. Solvent modifiers were 0.1% formic acid or 0.2% ammonium 
hydroxide with 50 mM ammonium acetate for positive and negative ionization modes, 
respectively.
All metabolites were analyzed using the MassHunter software package (Agilent 
Technologies) by quantifying the transition from parent precursor mass to product ions for 
each individual metabolite.

  Gene expression analysis
The TCGA breast invasive carcinoma dataset was sourced from data generated by the TCGA 
Research Network: http://cancergenome.nih.edu/, made available on the University of 
California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Cancer Browser. Series matrix files for ISPY1 (Accession: 
GSE22226) and a neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated cohort (Accession: GSE25066) were 
downloaded from GEO and processed using the GEOquery R package10,11,22. A 
chemotherapy-naïve and an aggressively treated early-stage cohort were obtained from the 
UCSC Cancer Browser12,13. Multiple probes corresponding to the same gene were collapsed 
using the “MaxMean” method in the WGCNA R package23,24.
A fatty acid metabolism gene set was compiled using genes containing the Gene Ontology 
term, GO:0006631 (http://geneontology.org). An average expression profile (centroid) of 
these genes was calculated for the triple-negative subset of samples within the TCGA breast 
invasive carcinoma dataset. Similarities between this centroid and gene expression profiles 
of samples from the four independent clinical cohorts were then quantified using a Pearson 
correlation metric.
Heatmaps and clustering analyses were performed using the gplots (http://cran.r-
project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html) and cluster (http://cran.r-project.org/web/
packages/cluster/index.html) R packages respectively.
To generate Kaplan Meier plots, samples were grouped by receptor status, and dichotomized 
by ACC2 expression at an optimal threshold, yielding groups with the most significant 
difference in distant recurrence-free survival based on the log-rank test. Kaplan Meier plots 
were then generated for the respective groups using the survival (http://cran.r-
project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html) R package.
Univariate cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed using the survival R 
package to assess the correlation of fatty acid metabolism gene expression to distant 
recurrence-free survival in the pooled neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated cohort11. This was 
conducted for all tumors, TN tumors and RP tumors.
 Cell lines and propagation
A panel of established TN and RP human breast cancer cell lines and their culture conditions 
have been previously described15. Primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) were 
derived from histologically normal breast tissues and cultured as previously described25. The 
cells were infected with lentivirus encoding p16 shRNA and further infected with pBabe-
MycER virus and named B1389-shp16-MycER (HMECMYC-ER)26,27. While expressing p16 
shRNA delays senescence, the cells are not immortalized and undergo spontaneous 
senescence when continuously cultured. Therefore, cells were not used beyond twelve 
passages past derivation. HMECMYC-ER cells were treated with four-hydroxytamoxifen 
(TAM) at 500 nM to induce MYC activation. RP (HCC1428 and T47D) cells stably 
overexpressing MYC have been previously described1. No cell line used in this paper is 
listed in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines maintained by ICLAC (http://
iclac.org/databases/cross-contaminations/). All lines were found negative for mycoplasma 
contamination.

  Immunoblot analysis
Proteins were extracted using RIPA buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% 
Na-deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM EDTA, and proteinase (Roche) plus 
phosphatase (Roche) inhibitor cocktails. Protein extracts were resolved using 4–12% SDS-
PAGE gels (Life Technologies) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Life 
Technologies). Membranes were probed with primary antibodies overnight on 4 °C shaker, 
then incubated with horseradish-peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies and signals 
were visualized with ECL (Bio Rad). The primary antibodies used are as follows: β-Actin 
(Actin) (sc-47778 HRP, Santa Cruz, 1:10,000), PGC1α (ab54481, Abcam, 1:500), BBOX1 
(WH0008424M1, Sigma Aldrich, 1:500), CPT2 (ab71435, Abcam, 1:500), FASN 
(SAB1403807, Sigma Aldrich, 1:1000), pACC1/2 (11818, Cell Signaling, 1:1000), ACC1 
(4190, Cell Signaling, 1:1000), ACC2 (8578, Cell Signaling, 1:1000), AMPK (2532, Cell 
Signaling, 1:1000), pAMPK (2535, Cell Signaling, 1:1000) and c-MYC (MYC) (ab32072, 
Abcam, 1:1000).
 ATP and NAD(P)H quantification
To determine ATP effects of etomoxir treatment, tumor cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 
5,000–7,000 cells per well and cultured in the presence of 0 or 200 µM etomoxir (Sigma-
Aldrich) for 48 h, with triplicate samples for each condition. Relative ATP concentration was 
determined using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). To 
determine NAD(P)H effects of etomoxir treatment, HMECMYC-ER cells were seeded in 96-
well plates at 2,000 cells per well and cultured in the presence of 0 or 500 nM TAM for 48 h, 
then 0 or 200 µM etomoxir for 24 h, with six samples for each condition. Relative NAD(P)H 
concentration was determined using CellTiter-Glo 96 AQueous One Solution Cell 
Proliferation Assay (Promega).
 Fatty acid oxidation assay
To determine relative fatty acid oxidation pathway activity, tumor cells were seeded in 24-
well plates at 100,000 cells per well in triplicate. Cells were incubated in serum-free 
medium for 2 h and then incubated back in standard medium for 1 h. 14C-oleic acid 
(Moravek Biochemicals, MC406) at 0.1 µCi/µL was added, 2×2 cm squares of Whatman 
paper were taped over wells, and cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. After adding 200 µL 
3 M NaOH directly to each square of Whatman paper, 100 µL 70% perchloric acid was 
added to each well and CO2 was captured at room temperature for 1 h. Whatman paper was 
dried at room temperature and placed in scintillation vial with 5 mL scintillation fluid. 14C 
radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counter and normalized to protein 
concentration.
 RNAi knockdown
MYC (L-003282-02-0005), CPT2 (M-008574-01-005) and non-targeting (D-001810-10-20) 
siRNAs were purchased from GE Dharmacon (SMARTpool, 4 siRNAs per gene) and used 
to transfect cells with 30 pmol using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Life 
Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Cells were incubated with siRNA 
for 72 h. For siMYC studies, media was changed at 24 h and 0 and 200 µM etomoxir was

 added for 48 h before ATP levels were quantified as described above. For siCPT2 studies, 
relative number of cells was determined at 72 h as described below.
The CPT1 knockdown data was extracted from the Project Achilles dataset17. The viability 
score represents the ATARiS solution, which is the computationally derived score that 
quantifies the gain or loss of growth specific to knockdown of the gene from pooled shRNA 
screens.
 Proliferation and viability assays
To determine proliferative effects of etomoxir treatment, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 
100,000–150,000 cells per well and cultured in the presence of 0 or 200 µM etomoxir. Cells 
were harvested at 24, 48 and 72 h. Cell counts were determined using the Countess 
Automated Cell Counter (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instruction, 
and cell viability was assessed by performing the flow cytometry-based Guava ViaCount 
viability assay (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. To determine 
proliferative effects of siCPT2 treatment, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 100,000–
150,000 cells per well and transfected with siNT or siCPT2 as described above. Cells were 
harvested at 24, 48 and 72 h and cell counts were determined using the Countess Automated 
Cell Counter (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Three 
independent biological replicates were performed for each time-point and condition.
 Matrix detachment assays
To determine the effects of matrix detachment, cells were seeded in ultra-low adhesion 
round bottom 96-well plates at 1,000 cells per well. Sphere formation was judged by 
brightfield imaging 4 d after seeding, and then spheres were subsequently culture in 0 or 200 
µM etomoxir for 48 h, with triplicate samples for each condition. Relative ATP 
concentration was determined as above.
 Glucose starvation assays
To determine the effects of glucose starvation, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 5,000–
7,000 cells per well and cultured in replete medium, glucose-depleted medium, 200 µM 
etomoxir or glucose-depleted medium and 200 µM etomoxir for 24 h, with triplicate samples 
for each condition. Relative ATP concentration was determined as above.
 Orthotopic allograft and xenograft studies
4 week-old WT FVB/N and immunocompromised NOD/SCID female mice were purchased 
from Taconic Biosciences. The derivation of the HCI-002 and HCI-009 TN patient-derived 
xenograft has been previously described21. Viably frozen MTB-TOM, HCI-002 and 
HCI-009 tumor samples were transplanted into the cleared mammary fat pads of FVB/N and 
NOD/SCID mice, respectively. Tumor growth was monitored daily by caliper measurement 
in two dimensions. Researchers were not blinded to treatment group.
For the 13C-palmitate experiment, the tumors were allowed to reach ~1.5 cm3 and then mice 
were randomized into experimental groups. Mice received 100 mg/kg 12C- or 13C-palmitate 
delivered by IP injection at t = 0 h. The palmitate was prepared by sonication into PEG-40

 (Spectrum). Mice were euthanized at t = 4 h and tumors and contralateral non-tumor 
mammary glands were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
For the HCI-002 acute etomoxir experiment (Fig. 2g), tumors were allowed to reach ~1.5 
cm3 and then mice were randomized into experimental groups. Mice received vehicle or 60 
mg/kg etomoxir delivered by IP injection at t = 0 and 24 h. Mice were euthanized at t = 26 h 
and tumors were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
For the remaining in vivo studies, tumors reached ~1 cm3 when mice were randomized into 
experimental groups and drug treatment was initiated. For the MTB-TOM studies (Fig. 2h, 
Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Table 6), mice received vehicle or 20 or 40 
mg/kg etomoxir delivered by IP injection daily for 14 d. Tumor growth was monitored daily 
by caliper measurement. Mice were euthanized after 14 d of treatment or if tumors reached 
2cm in any dimension and tumors were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. For the HCI-002 and 
HCI-009 studies (Fig. 2i,j), mice received vehicle, 40 or 60 mg/kg etomoxir delivered by IP 
injection daily for 21 d. Tumor growth was monitored daily by caliper measurement. Mice 
were euthanized after 21 d of treatment or if tumors reached 2 cm in any dimension and for 
the HCI-002 study two pieces of tumor from separate locations were fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde (n = 5 for vehicle, n = 7 for 40 mg/kg, n = 4 for 60 mg/kg). Remaining 
tumor was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
 Immunohistochemical analysis
PFA-fixed tumor samples were paraffin-embedded and a tissue microarray (TMA) of 
HCI-002 tumors following described treatment conditions was created using two 2 mm 
punch cores per each tumor. Immunohistochemical staining of the TMA for Ki-67 was 
performed using MIB-1 antibody clone (1:50 dilution; DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA) 
following 20 minutes antigen retrieval with epitope retrieval solution 2 (Leica Biosystems, 
Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). Images were scored as the percentage of Ki-67 positive tumor cell 
nuclei per total tumor cell nuclei in each captured field using Immunoratio software (http://
jvsmicroscope.uta.fi/immunoratio/). TUNEL staining was performed using the ApopTag 
Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s 
instruction. Images were scored as the total number of TUNEL positive cells per captured 
field. All quantification was performed blinded to treatment group; TMA was created with 
independent labeling system.
 Statistical analysis
Prism software was used to generate and analyze Pearson correlations (Fig. 2f) and the 
survival plot (Fig. 2h). Correlation P-values were generated using a two-sided t-test. Clade 
enrichment P-value was generated using a Fisher’s exact test. Survival plot P-value was 
generated using a log-rank test. All differential metabolite abundance and gene expression 
analyses were performed using the limma R package.
Differential metabolite abundance between MTB-TOM tumors and non-tumor mammary 
glands was performed using the limma R package28. Metabolites that were significantly 
different between these groups at a false discovery rate of 0.05 were extracted for 
downstream analyses. Pathway enrichment within this set of metabolites was quantified

 using the maxmean method within the piano R package29, based on annotations from the 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG): http://www.genome.jp/kegg/. 
Significantly enriched pathways were identified at a P-value cutoff of 0.05.
For all other comparisons, unpaired two-sided t-tests were used (GraphPad). No statistical 
method was used to predetermine sample size. The investigators were not blinded to 
allocation during in vivo experiments. The investigators were blinded during 
immunohistochemical analysis. All in vivo studies were randomized as tumors reached 
predetermined volume on a per experiment basis as described above. For each dataset, the 
data meet the assumptions of the statistical test used as determined by distribution and 
variance.
Sample size for all experiments (in vitro and in vivo) was not chosen with consideration of 
adequate power to detect a pre-specified effect size. For in vitro studies, all completed 
experiments are reported. For in vivo studies, number of indicated mice represents total 
number of mice treated and processed for each experiment. No samples were fully processed 
for metabolomic analysis or otherwise and then excluded. For the etomoxir treatment 
studies, mice were euthanized at ethical endpoint (~2 cm) or at study endpoint unless they 
surpassed predetermined UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee quality of life 
guidelines. No mice that completed the studies were excluded from analyses. In the 
prolonged PDX etomoxir study (Fig. 2h), two mice from the vehicle group and one mouse 
from the 60 mg/kg experimental group were found dead of unknown causes, and these 
tumors were not included in further analyses.
