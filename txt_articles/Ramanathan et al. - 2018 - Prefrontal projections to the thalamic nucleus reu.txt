The thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) receives dense projections from the medial prefrontal
cortex (mPFC), interconnects the mPFC and hippocampus, and may serve a pivotal role in
regulating emotional learning and memory. Here we show that the RE and its mPFC afferents
are critical for the extinction of Pavlovian fear memories in rats. Pharmacological inactivation
of the RE during extinction learning or retrieval increases freezing to an extinguished con-
ditioned stimulus (CS); renewal of fear outside the extinction context was unaffected. Sup-
pression of fear in the extinction context is associated with an increase in c-fos expression
and spike firing in RE neurons to the extinguished CS. The role for the RE in suppressing
extinguished fear requires the mPFC, insofar as pharmacogenetically silencing mPFC to RE
projections impairs the expression of extinction memory. These results reveal that mPFC-RE
circuits inhibit the expression of fear, a function that is essential for adaptive emotional
regulation.

earning to contend with threats in the environment is
essential to survival. It allows animals, whether rats or
humans, to anticipate harm and organize appropriate
defensive behaviors in response to threat. However, aversive
learning can become maladaptive and lead to pathological con-
ditions such as panic disorder, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress
disorder to name a few1,2. Of course, fear memories are evolu-
tionarily programmed to be rapidly acquired, temporally endur-
ing, and broadly generalized across both familiar and novel
contexts. In contrast, procedures that reduce fear and anxiety,
such as exposure therapy, tend to produce fear suppression that is
often slow to develop, short-lived, and context-dependent3–5.
Therefore, considerable research has explored the neural circuits
that govern these forms of learning. In the laboratory, Pavlovian
fear conditioning and extinction procedures are widely used to
study the neural basis of emotional memory. Briefly, animals
learn an innocuous conditioned stimulus (CS) predicts an aver-
sive unconditioned stimulus (US). After fear conditioning, ani-
mals exhibit conditioned fear responses (CRs), such as freezing, to
presentation of the CS alone. Repeated presentation of the CS
alone (i.e., extinction training) ultimately reduces conditioned
responses6,7. Importantly, extinction represents new learning and
does not erase the original fear memory. Fear to an extinguished
CS returns under many circumstances, including when the CS is
encountered outside of the extinction context, a phenomenon
termed renewal8,9. Because extinction learning is at the heart of
clinical interventions, such as exposure therapy, that are aimed to
treat stress- or trauma-related disorders such as post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), many patients are prone to fear relapse3,5.
Decades of research have implicated the hippocampus (HPC),
medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and basolateral amygdala
(BLA) in the encoding and context-dependent expression of
extinction memories2,10. Recently, we have shown that the
renewal of fear to an extinguished CS activates ventral hippo-
campal (vHPC) neurons projecting to both the mPFC and
BLA11–13. Importantly, functional disconnection of the vHPC
and either the prelimbic (PL) prefrontal cortex or BLA impairs
fear renewal12. These studies support a circuit model in which
vHPC projections to the mPFC and BLA facilitate the retrieval of
CS-US memories when an extinguished CS is encountered out-
side the extinction context12,13. However, when the CS is
encountered in the extinction context, the retrieval of fear
memories must be suppressed in order to dampen fear responses,
such as freezing, to the CS. Recent work in humans suggests that
retrieval suppression might be mediated by prefrontal cortical
projections to the hippocampus14.
Anatomically, the mPFC does not project directly to the HPC,
but it can influence the HPC through indirect projections. For
example, the mPFC projects to midline thalamic nuclei that relay
information to both the hippocampus and amygdala15,16. mPFC
projections to the midline paraventricular nucleus, in particular,
have been implicated in the expression of conditioned fear17,18. In
addition, the nucleus reuniens (RE), a midline thalamic nucleus is
well positioned to mediate mPFC influences on hippocampal
function16,19,20. Lesions or inactivation of the RE impair forms of
memory that require both the mPFC and HPC21–23, including
goal-directed
spatial
memory24
and
contextual
fear
memories25,26. Given the crucial role of the RE in mediating
mPFC-HPC interactions, we sought to determine whether it also
plays a role in the encoding and retrieval of context-dependent
extinction memories. Using Pavlovian fear conditioning and
extinction procedures in rats, we show that pharmacological
inactivation of the RE dramatically increases freezing behavior
during both the encoding and later retrieval of an extinction
memory. This extinction impairment was not state-dependent.
This pattern of extinction deficits was reproduced by selective
pharmacogenetic silencing of mPFC neurons (or their terminals)
projecting to the RE. Taken together, these data reveal a novel
role for the prefrontal-reuniens circuit in the inhibition of fear
after extinction. This circuit may function to oppose fear
expression after threat has passed.
Results
RE inactivation impairs encoding of extinction. To explore the
role of RE in fear extinction, we first examined whether reversible
inactivation of the RE with the GABAA agonist muscimol would
impair the acquisition and later retrieval of the extinction
memory. Because mPFC-HPC circuits have been implicated in
contextual processing2,27, we were particularly interested in
whether RE inactivation might influence the context-dependence
of the extinction memory. To this end, we examined the effects of
RE inactivation on freezing during within-subject retrieval tests
conducted in the extinction (ABB) and conditioning (ABA)
contexts. Rats were first implanted with a single midline cannula
targeting the RE (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Figure 1). After recovery
from surgery, rats underwent fear conditioning, extinction, and
retrieval testing (Fig. 1b). During fear conditioning (Fig. 1c, left),
rats exhibited low levels of freezing behavior prior to the onset of
the first conditioning trial, and an increase in freezing across the
conditioning trials [repeated measures ANOVA, main effect of
trial, F(5, 115) =36.7, p < 0.001]. The levels of freezing did not differ
between the drug groups [F < 1.8], indicating that rats in each
group acquired similar levels of conditioned fear. The following
day, rats received intra-RE infusions of either saline (SAL) or
muscimol (MUS) immediately prior to an extinction training
session (45 CS-alone trials) that was conducted in a context dif-
ferent from that used for conditioning. During this session
(Fig. 1c, middle), both groups of rats exhibited robust conditioned
freezing to the CS in the earliest trial block, and saline-treated rats
exhibited a within-session decrease in freezing that is typical of
extinction learning. However, inactivation of the RE completely
eliminated this within-session decrement in freezing [repeated
measures ANOVA, main effect of drug, F(1,
23) =14.86, p =
0.0008; drug × trial interaction F(9, 20) = 6.46, p < 0.0001].
Twenty-four hours after extinction, rats were tested for their
fear to the extinguished CS in both the extinction (retrieval) and
conditioning (renewal) contexts. As shown in Fig. 1c (right), rats
extinguished under muscimol showed greater levels of CS-elicited
freezing compared to control rats and this was particularly
pronounced in the extinction context; both groups of rats
renewed fear to the extinguished CS outside the extinction
context. These observations were confirmed in a repeated
measures ANOVA, which revealed main effects of drug [F(1,2)
= 5.14; p = 0.03] and test context [F(1,23) = 16.85; p = 0.0004].
Although there was not a reliable drug x test interaction [F(1,23) =
0.89; p = 0.36], planned comparisons revealed a significant
difference between SAL and MUS groups during the retrieval
session (p = 0.011) but not in the renewal session (p = 0.226).
These results reveal that RE inactivation causes a deficit in the
acquisition of fear extinction.
RE inactivation impairs extinction retrieval, but not fear
renewal. Given the critical role of the RE in encoding an
extinction memory, we next examined the role of the RE in the
retrieval those memories. Rats were implanted with a single
midline cannula targeting the RE and, after recovery from sur-
gery, underwent fear conditioning, extinction, and retrieval test-
ing (see Fig. 2a for behavioral design). RE placements were
similar to those in Supplementary Figure 1. Freezing behavior
during the conditioning session is shown in Fig. 2b. As before,
freezing was low before fear conditioning but significantly

 increased across the conditioning trials [repeated measures
ANOVA, main effect of trial, F(5, 145) =26.3, p < 0.0001]. The
following day the rats received extinction training in a different
context. Rats showed high levels of CS-elicited freezing early in
the session, but it dramatically decreased by the end of the session
[repeated measures ANOVA, main effect of trial, F(9, 261) = 53.0,
p < 0.0001], indicating successful within-session extinction. There
were no group differences observed during the conditioning and
extinction sessions [Fs < 1.6].
On subsequent days, the rats received intra-RE infusions of
SAL or MUS immediately prior to retrieval tests in the
extinction and conditioning contexts; each rat was tested under
the same drug condition for both tests. As shown in Fig. 2b,
saline-treated rats exhibited significantly lower fear in the
retrieval context relative to the renewal context. Importantly,
MUS infusions into RE increased CS-elicited freezing in the
extinction
context,
but
not
the
renewal
context.
These
observations were confirmed in a repeated measures ANOVA
that revealed significant main effects of drug [F(1,29) = 8.79; p
= 0.006],
test
context
[F(1,18) = 20.2;
p = 0.0003]
and
a
significant drug × test interaction [F(1,29) = 4.43; p = 0.04].
Post-hoc comparisons revealed a significant difference between
SAL and MUS groups during the retrieval session (p = 0.0024)
but not in the renewal session (p = 0.28). These results reveal
that RE inactivation causes a deficit in the retrieval of
extinction
memories.
Importantly,
the
increased freezing
produced by RE inactivation was not due to nonspecific
reductions in locomotor activity insofar as both pre-CS
baseline freezing and fear renewal were unaffected by RE
inactivation (Supplementary Fig. 2a). These results indicate
that the RE is required for the inhibition of conditioned fear to
an extinguished CS.
Muscimol-induced extinction impairments are not state-
dependent. The previous results reveal that MUS infusions into
the RE impair both the encoding and retrieval of fear extinction,
but did not affect fear renewal. It is possible that this pattern of
results is due to a shift in interoceptive (i.e., drug) context
between extinction and retrieval testing that itself causes fear
renewal28. To examine this possibility, we conducted an experi-
ment in which RE inactivation occurred before both the extinc-
tion and retrieval sessions. If the interoceptive context associated
with RE inactivation is critical for the expression of extinction,
then animals that are extinguished and tested after RE inactiva-
tion should show normal extinction retrieval.
To examine this possibility, rats were implanted with a single
midline cannula targeting the RE and after recovery from surgery
underwent fear conditioning, extinction, and retrieval testing.
Muscimol was infused in RE prior to both extinction and retrieval
sessions. During the extinction session (Fig. 3, middle), we
replicated our previous observation that RE inactivation impairs
within-session extinction compared to saline controls [repeated
measures ANOVA, main effect of group, F(2,60) = 12.8; p < 0.001].
During retrieval testing (Fig. 3, right), animals extinguished and
tested under RE inactivation continued to exhibit an extinction
impairment relative to SAL-treated controls and exhibited levels
of fear comparable to that in rats that did not undergo extinction.
These observations were confirmed in an ANOVA performed on
the average CS-elicited freezing during the test [main effect of
group, F(2,60) = 4.8; p < 0.05]. Post-hoc comparison revealed that
SAL-treated rats differed from both MUS-treated and No-ext
controls, which did not differ from one another. Importantly,
these data indicate the extinction retrieval deficits in muscimol-
treated rats are not due to a drug-shift induced renewal, because
extinction deficits were observed in animals extinguished and
tested in the same drug state. These results indicate that encoding
and retrieval deficits after MUS infusions into RE are not due to
state-dependent generalization deficits.
Another possibility is that extinguishing the animals outside
the extinction context more strongly contextualizes the extinction
memory than delivering extinction trials in the conditioning
context29. This might increase the sensitivity of extinction to RE
inactivation. To examine this issue, we compared the effects of RE
inactivation on extinction retrieval in rats that underwent
extinction in either the conditioning context (COND) or a novel
context (NOVEL); all rats were then tested in their respective
extinction contexts (AAA or ABB) and then in a novel renewal
context (C)
(see Supplementary
Figure 3a for behavioral
paradigm). Animals were first implanted with cannulas targeting
RE and, after recovery from surgery, underwent fear conditioning
in context A (Supplementary Figure 3b). On Day 2, animals were
extinguished in either the conditioning context (COND) or a
novel context (NOVEL). During the extinction session, rats
showed high levels of CS-elicited freezing early in the session, but
it dramatically decreased by the end of the session indicating
successful extinction [repeated measures ANOVA, main effect of
trial F(1,11) = 13.07; p = 0.0041]. Freezing in rats extinguished in
the conditioning context was significantly higher than that in rats
extinguished in the novel context [repeated measures ANOVA,
main effect of extinction context F(1,11) = 11.24; p = 0.007], which
reflects a summation of context and CS fear in the conditioning
context.
On subsequent days, animals received infusions of SAL or
MUS (counterbalanced, within-S’s design) and a retrieval test in
the extinction context followed by a test in a third novel context
(renewal test). During the retrieval test (Supplementary Figure 3b,
right), MUS infusions into the RE increased freezing to the
extinguished CS independent of the extinction procedure; MUS
infusions did not affect the renewal of freezing outside the
extinction context. These observations were confirmed in a one-
way repeated-measures ANOVA that revealed a main effect of
drug [F(1,11) = 37.57; p < 0.001], but no effect of extinction
context [F(1,11) = 0.79; p = 0.39] or drug × context interaction
[F(1,11) = 2.44; p = 0.15]. During the renewal session, a one-way
repeated measures ANOVA revealed no main effect of drug
[F(1,11) =2.98; p = 0.12] or extinction context [F(1,11) = 0.21; p =
0.65] and no interaction between the two variables F(1,11) = 2.13;
p = 0.13].
Encoding and retrieval of extinction increases Fos expression
in RE. The previous results indicate that RE inactivation impairs
both the encoding and retrieval of extinction memories. Here we
sought to determine whether RE neurons are activated (as
indexed by c-Fos immunohistochemistry) during the encoding
and retrieval of extinction memories. To this end, we examined
Fos expression in the RE after the extinction training session, as
well as after extinction retrieval. In the first case (Fig. 4a), rats
underwent auditory fear conditioning followed 24 h later by
extinction training; the animals were sacrificed 90 min after the
end of the extinction session. Conditioning and extinction of fear
were similar to previous experiments (Fig. 4c). As shown in
Fig. 4b–d, animals that underwent fear extinction exhibited sig-
nificantly higher number of Fos+ neurons in the RE compared to
home control rats [unpaired t test, t(12) = 5.5, p < 0.001]. Retrieval
testing also increased Fos expression in the RE. As shown in
Fig. 4e, after conditioning and extinction, conditioned freezing to
the extinguished CS was suppressed in the retrieval context and
elevated in the renewal context. Interestingly, testing in either the
retrieval or renewal contexts increased the number of Fos+
neurons in RE relative to home-cage controls (Fig. 4f). A one-way

 ANOVA revealed a main effect of group [F(2,25) = 3.8, p < 0.05]
and post-hoc comparisons revealed that both SAME and DIFF
groups were reliably higher than the HOME control and did not
differ from one another. These results reveal that RE neurons are
recruited during both encoding and retrieval of extinction
memories (including extinction memories undergoing renewal).
Extinguished CSs increase single-unit firing in the RE. The
previous data indicate that extinguished CSs increase Fos
expression in the RE in both the extinction and renewal contexts.
However, Fos expression has low temporal resolution and inte-
grates neuronal activity elicited by both the context and CS
during retrieval testing. It is therefore possible that RE neurons
respond differentially to CSs presented in the extinction and
renewal contexts. To examine this possibility, we made single-
unit recordings from RE neurons in freely behaving rats using a
within-subject design. A schematic illustration of the behavioral
paradigm is shown in Fig. 5a. Briefly, animals were implanted
with a microwire bundle targeting RE (see Fig. 5b for repre-
sentative electrode placements). After recovery from surgery,
animals underwent auditory fear conditioning followed 24 h later
by extinction training.
Twenty-four hours after extinction, the rats received an
unsignaled reminder shock in context A to facilitate the return
of freezing during the renewal test. On the subsequent day, rats
were subjected to a within-subject testing procedure wherein the
extinguished CS was presented in both the extinction context
(retrieval) and a novel context (renewal); single-unit recordings
were made during both tests and the same neurons were tracked
across sessions. During the retrieval tests (Fig. 5d), rats showed
lower levels of freezing in the extinction context relative to the
renewal context, though this was not statistically reliable [F(1,2) =
17.10; p = 0.053 for trial 1]. During the retrieval tests we recorded
from a total of 27 neurons in RE. The basal firing rate of these
neurons was significantly higher in the retrieval (2.88 ± 0.17 Hz)
than the renewal (2.42 ± 0.22 Hz) [paired t test; t(26) = −2.3, p <
0.03]. Among this population of cells, seven neurons (25%)
exhibited significant increases in firing to the tone CS (defined as
an increase in firing rate > 1.96 standard deviations above the 500
ms pre-CS baseline). Interestingly, tone-responsive RE neurons
exhibited greater CS-evoked firing within 200 ms of CS onset in
the extinction context relative to that in the renewal context
(Fig. 5c, d). This observation was confirmed in a one-way
repeated measures ANOVA that revealed a main effect of test
[F(1,6) = 15.67; p = 0.008] indicating that neurons in RE showed
greater CS-evoked responses to an extinguished CS in the
extinction context relative to the renewal context.
Silencing RE projectors in the mPFC impairs extinction
encoding. The mPFC plays a critical role in extinction learning
and retrieval. The RE receives heavy input from the mPFC and
this may represent a critical functional input regulating fear
extinction. Here we sought to determine whether mPFC projec-
tions to the RE are involved in the acquisition and retrieval of fear
extinction. Rats received injections of AAV5-Cre-GFP in the RE
and
AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry
in
the
mPFC
4–5 weeks prior to behavioral training (see Fig. 1b for behavioral
design and Fig. 6a for viral expression). Twenty-four hours after
auditory fear conditioning [repeated measures ANOVA, main
effect of trial, F(5,160) = 35.6; p < 0.001] (Fig. 6b, left), rats received
systemic injections of either SAL or CNO and underwent fear
extinction. As shown in Fig. 6b (middle), CNO administration
increased CS-elicited freezing during the extinction session
[repeated measures ANOVA, main effect of drug F(1,32) = 4.15; p
= 0.05.
During retrieval testing (Fig. 6b, right), all animals exhibited
low levels of freezing in the extinction context and increased
freezing to the CS in the renewal context [repeated measures
ANOVA, main effect of test F(1,32) = 17.57; p = 0.0002]. Inter-
estingly, rats that previously received CNO during extinction
training showed higher levels of freezing compared to SAL-
treated rats during both of the retrieval tests [repeated measures
ANOVA, main effect of drug, F(1,31) = 8.23; p = 0.007]. Post-hoc
comparisons revealed that CNO-injected animals showed ele-
vated levels of freezing compared to SAL-injected animals during
both retrieval (p = 0.031) and renewal (p = 0.011) sessions. These
results are consistent with the effects that we previously showed
with RE inactivation alone and reveal that projections from the
mPFC to the RE are involved in extinction learning. Furthermore,
this effect was not simply a performance effect of CNO (e.g., non-
specific increases in freezing), insofar as pre-CS baseline freezing
during extinction training was not affected by CNO [unpaired t
test; t(32) = 0.18; p = 0.85] and the extinction impairments were
manifest during the drug-free retrieval tests.
Silencing RE projectors in the mPFC impairs extinction
retrieval. Next, we examined whether mPFC projections to RE
also mediate the retrieval of extinction memories. Rats received
injections of CAV2-Cre in the RE and AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4D
(Gi)-mCherry in the mPFC 4–5 weeks prior to behavioral training
(See Fig. 2a for behavioral design). As shown in Fig. 6c, rats

 using a within-subjects design in which each animal served as its
own control. That is, rats were tested after receiving either SAL or
CNO in two counterbalanced tests in the extinction context,
which were conducted over two days. As shown in Fig. 6c (right),
CNO administration impaired the retrieval of the extinction
memory and increased freezing in the extinction context [repe-
ated measures ANOVA, main effect of drug, F(1,6) = 7.2; p <
0.05]. Importantly, CNO did not increase baseline freezing prior
to CS onset [repeated measures ANOVA, no main effect of drug
F(1,6) = 0.55; p = 0.49] (Supplementary Fig. 2b). These results
indicate that prefrontal projections to the RE are involved in both
the encoding and retrieval of extinction memory.
Silencing mPFC terminals in RE impairs extinction retrieval.
The previous experiment reveals that mPFC neurons that project
to RE are involved in both the encoding and retrieval of extinc-
tion memories. However, silencing these projection neurons
might influence mPFC output to other brain areas insofar it has
been shown that mPFC neurons send collateral projections to
medio-dorsal thalamus and reticular thalamus30. To specifically
manipulate mPFC projections to RE, we expressed inhibitory
DREADDs (or a blank control) in the mPFC and microinfused
CNO into the RE to inactivate mPFC terminals31. A schematic

 AAV8-hSyn-GFP in either PL or IL (Fig. 7b) or both and were
implanted with cannula targeting the RE five weeks after viral
infusions. Viral infusions in the mPFC produced robust terminal
expression in the RE (Supplementary Figure 4).
One week after cannula implantation, rats underwent auditory
fear conditioning [repeated measures ANOVA, main effect of
trial, F(5,240) =50.72; p < 0.001, no main effect of group F(3,48)
=0.604, p = 0.61] and three sessions of extinction training
[repeated measures ANOVA, main effect of trials, F(1,48) =
132.45; p < 0.0001, no main effect of group F(3,48) = 0.28; p =
0.84] (Supplementary Figure 4). On the following two days after
the last extinction session, rats received extinction retrieval tests
using a within-subjects design in which each animal served as its
own control (Fig. 7c). That is, rats were tested after receiving
infusions of either SAL or CNO in two counterbalanced tests in
the extinction context, which were conducted over two days. As
shown in Fig. 7c, CNO infusion into RE increased conditional
freezing to the extinguished CS in animals expressing inhibitory
DREADDs in either the PL, IL or both areas; CNO did not affect
freezing in blank controls. These observations were confirmed in
a repeated measures ANOVA that revealed a main effect of drug
[F(1,48) = 17.74; p = 0.0001], without a main effect of group,
[F(3,48) =1.73; p = 0.17] or a group x drug interaction [F(3,48) =
2.02; p = 0.12]. Planned comparisons revealed that CNO infu-
sions did not result in any changes in freezing in rats receiving
blank GFP virus (p = 0.74) confirming that CNO-induced
increases in freezing are not due to nonspecific effects of the
drug. However, CNO infusions increased freezing in all three
groups expressing inhibitory DREADDs in the mPFC: PL + IL (p
= 0.022), PL (p = 0.012), and IL (p = 0.046). These results
indicate that both prelimbic and infralimbic prefrontal projec-
tions to the RE are involved in the retrieval of an extinguished
fear memory.
Discussion
Here we have demonstrated for the first time that the nucleus
reuniens of the midline thalamus is required for both encoding
and retrieving extinction memories. Extinction training or
retrieval testing increased the activity of RE neurons and inacti-
vation of the RE or its projections from the mPFC produced
deficits in extinction memory. Taken together, the present study
reveals a novel role for prefrontal-thalamic circuits in fear
extinction and suggests the RE is a key structure mediating pre-
frontal top-down inhibitory control of fear inhibition that is
crucial for extinction.

 The fact that the RE is critically involved in extinction learning
and recall is in line with previous work demonstrating the
importance of the midline thalamus in both memory and emo-
tion23–25,32–35. Importantly, a recent study demonstrated that the
RE is important for maintaining the specificity of contextual fear
memory25. Specifically, the authors showed that RE inactivation
caused an overgeneralization of conditional fear to contexts other
than the one in which shock was encountered, but did not affect
fear recall in the original conditioning context or auditory fear
expression25. Interestingly, both contextual conditioning and the
extinction of fear to an auditory CS rely heavily on contextual
processing. That is, contextual fear conditioning requires the
acquisition of a contextual representation that comes in to asso-
ciation with an aversive US. As a result, conditioned fear is
expressed in the place where shock is encountered, but not in
other places. Similarly, extinction involves learning that a CS is
not reinforced in a particular context. In this case, the suppres-
sion of fear to a CS after extinction occurs in the extinction
context, but not in other places; in other words, fear to an
extinguished CS renews outside the extinction context2. In both
cases, deficits in contextual specificity—knowing what happened
where—would result in both overgeneralized fear after context
conditioning and an inappropriate renewal of fear after extinc-
tion. In both cases, fear is expressed in otherwise safe contexts.
Together, these data suggest that the RE and its connections with
the mPFC might be involved in the inhibition of fear in safe
contexts. Importantly, RE or mPFC-RE projections were not
involved in mediating the renewal of fear to an extinguished CS
outside the extinction context.
Previous studies from our lab have demonstrated that the
renewal of extinguished fear requires the hippocampus and its
projections to the mPFC11–13,27. HPC inactivation or dis-
connections of the HPC and mPFC disrupted fear renewal, but
did not affect the expression of extinction12,36. This reveals that
direct HPC-mPFC projections are not involved in fear inhibition,
but rather contribute to the excitation of fear to an extinguished
CS outside the extinction context. In the present study, we have
shown that direct mPFC inputs to the RE are crucial for fear

 extinction. Indeed, the RE has been suggested as a critical hub
that interconnects the mPFC and hippocampus16,19. Prefrontal
projections to the RE are involved in fear memory general-
ization25, goal-directed spatial navigation24, motivation and
reward related behavior37 and spatial working memory19,23.
Anatomically, there are strong reciprocal projections between the
RE and the mPFC and hippocampus38, and the RE is important
for synchronizing local field potentials in this circuit39. This
suggests that the mPFC-RE interactions we find are important for
extinction learning might ultimately be mediated through RE
projections to the hippocampus. Indeed, interactions between the
mPFC and HPC are involved in a number of emotional and
cognitive processes associated with fear and anxiety including
extinction2,9,11,20,27,40–42.
Indeed, a role for mPFC-RE-HPC circuits in the inhibition of
conditioned fear in safe contexts might be an example of a
broader role of this circuit in retrieval suppression. For example,
humans can actively suppress recalling a particular memory,
either by being instructed to do so in the laboratory or sponta-
neously when confronted with a reminder of a trauma. Inter-
estingly, functional neuroimaging work indicates that retrieval
suppression is associated with an increase in activity in the mPFC,
but a suppression of activity in the hippocampus14. It has been
suggested that RE might coordinate this inhibitory influence of
the mPFC on hippocampal memory retrieval. In the context of
the present work, this mechanism might eliminate interference
between fear and extinction memories, by suppressing the
retrieval of the fear memory in otherwise safe contexts. That is,
during extinction retrieval, when an extinguished CS is encoun-
tered in a safe context, a retrieval suppression process mediated
by projections of the mPFC to the HPC via the RE might prevent
retrieval of the fear memory. Alternatively, RE projections to the
amygdala, including the basolateral and basomedial amygdala43,
might allow for both the mPFC and HPC to exert integrated
contextual control over the expression of fear.
In conclusion, the present study reveals that mPFC inputs to
the RE are critically involved in fear extinction. Given the critical
role for mPFC-HPC interactions in emotional memory retrieval,
we propose that the RE serves as a hub by which mPFC regulates
HPC activity to suppress the retrieval of fear memories. Inhibi-
tion of either the RE or its inputs from the mPFC impairs both
extinction encoding and retrieval, resulting in excessive fear in an
otherwise safe context. Preventing fear relapse is at the core of
exposure therapy; therefore, future studies are needed to under-
stand how dysfunction in mPFC-RE circuits underlies psycho-
pathology associated with stress- and trauma-related events.
Methods
Subjects. Adult male rats (200–224 g; Long-Evans Blue Spruce) obtained from
Envigo were used for the experiments. The rats were individually housed on a 14/
10 h light/dark cycle and had access to food and water ad libitum. All experiments
were performed during the light cycle. The rats were handled for 30 s every day for
5 days before the experiments to habituate them to the experimenters. All
experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the protocols
approved by the Texas A&M University Animal Care and Use Committee.

 Viruses and drugs. AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry (titer ≥ 4 × 1012 vg/
mL) was obtained from University of North Carolina Vector Core and Addgene.
CAV2-Cre (titer: 8.7 × 1012 pp/mL) was obtained from the Institute of Molecular
Genetics of Montpellier and AAV5-CMV-HI-eGFP-Cre-WPRE-SV40 (titer:
0.64–1.42 × 1014 GC/mL) was from University of Pennsylvania Vector Core. AAV-
8-hsyn-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry (titer: 3 × 1012 vp/mL) and AAv8-hSyn-eGFP (titer:
3 × 1012 vp/mL) was obtained from Addgene. Clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) was
provided by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH; Chemical Synthesis
and Drug Supply Program) and muscimol (GABAA receptor agonist) was from
Sigma.
Surgery. For muscimol microinfusion experiments, rats were anesthetized with
isoflurane (5% for induction, ~2% for maintenance), and placed into a stereotaxic
instrument (Kopf Instruments). An incision was made in the scalp, the head was
leveled, and bregma coordinates were identified. Small holes were drilled in the
skull to affix three jeweler’s screws and to target a single midline cannula (8 mm, 26
gauge; Plastics One) above the RE. The cannula was implanted at a 10° angle on the
midline (A/P: −2.05 to 2.15 mm, M/L: + 1.0 mm, D/V: −6.7 to 6.9 mm from dura;
coordinates were measured from bregma). The cannula was affixed to the skull
with dental cement, and a stainless-steel dummy cannula (30 gauge, 9 mm; Plastics
One) was inserted into the guide cannula. Rats were allowed to recover for a period
of 7 d after surgery before behavioral testing.
For DREADD experiments targeting the mPFC→RE circuit, rats were bilaterally
infused with AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry into the mPFC (including PL
and IL), and CAV2-Cre or AAV5-Cre-eGFP into the RE. Within the mPFC, two
infusions (1.0 μl each) were made in the IL (A/P: +2.7–3.0 mm, M/L: ±0.5–0.75
mm, D/V: −4.4 mm from dura) and PL (A/P: + 2.7–3.0 mm, M/L: ± 0.75 mm, D/
V: −3.2 mm from dura), respectively. A single infusion (1.0–1.2 μl) was made in
the RE (A/P: −2.15 mm, M/L: +1.0 mm, D/V: −6.9 mm from dura) at a 10° angle.
For the terminal inactivation experiment, rats were bilaterally infused with
AAV8-hSyn-eGFP into PL and IL using the coordinates mentioned above. For the
active virus groups, targeting of PL and PL + IL groups was done using the
coordinates mentioned above. However, for the IL group the following coordinate
was used in order to limit the damage to PL (A/P = +2.7–3.0, M/L = ± 2.0, D/V =
−4.9 from dura at 30° angle).
Drug delivery. For RE microinfusions, rats were transported to an infusion room
using white buckets (5-gallon) from the vivarium. The dummy cannula was
removed from the implanted guide and a stainless steel injector (33 gauge, 9 mm)
connected to tubing was inserted into the guide cannula for intracranial infusions.
Polyethylene tubing connected the injectors to Hamilton syringes (10 μl), which
were mounted in an infusion pump (Kd Scientific). Infusions were monitored by
the movement of an air bubble that separated the drug or saline solutions from
distilled water within the polyethylene tubing. All infusions were made ~10 min
before either extinction training or retrieval sessions. Muscimol was diluted in
sterile saline to a concentration of 0.1 μg/μl. For terminal inactivation experiment,
CNO dissolved in SAL (with 2.5% DMSO) at 1 mM concentration. Infusions were
made at a rate of 0.1 μl/min for 3 min (0.3 μl total) and the injectors were left in
place for 1 min for diffusion. After infusions, clean dummies were secured to the
guide cannula.
For DREADD experiments, CNO was first dissolved in 2.5% DMSO and then
diluted in sterile saline (0.9%) to a concentration of 3 mg/ml immediately before
injection. Approximately 30–40 min before extinction or testing session, rats
received intraperitoneal injection of either CNO (3 mg/kg) or saline in the vivarium
and then were placed back to their home cages until the start of the behavioral
procedures.
Behavioral apparatus and contexts. Sixteen identical rodent conditioning
chambers (30 × 24 × 21 cm; Med-Associates, St Albans, VT) were used in all
behavioral sessions. Each chamber consisted of two aluminum sidewalls and a
Plexiglas ceiling and rear wall, and a hinged Plexiglas door. The floor consisted of
19 stainless steel rods that were wired to a shock source and a solid-state grid
scrambler (Med-Associates) for the delivery of footshocks. A speaker mounted on
the outside of the grating in one aluminum wall was used to deliver auditory
stimuli. Additionally, ventilation fans and house lights were installed in each
chamber to allow for the manipulation of contexts. Each conditioning chamber rest
on a load-cell platform that is used to record chamber displacement in response to
each rat’s motor activity and is acquired online via Threshold Activity software
(Med-Associates). For each chamber, load-cell voltages are digitized at 5 Hz,
yielding one observation every 200 ms. Freezing was quantified by computing the
number of observations for each rat that had a value less than the freezing
threshold (load-cell activity = 10). Freezing was only scored if the rat is immobile
for at least 1 s. Stimuli were adjusted within conditioning chambers to generate two
distinct contexts in two distinct behavioral rooms. For context A, a 15-W house
light was turned on, and the room light remained on. Ventilation fans (65 dB) were
turned on, cabinet doors were left open, and the chambers were cleaned with 1%
ammonium hydroxide. Rats were transported to context A in white plastic boxes.
For context B, house lights were turned off and a fluorescent red room light was
turned on. The cabinet doors were closed and the chambers were cleaned with
1–1.5% acetic acid. Rats were transported to context B in black plastic boxes.
Behavioral procedures. For muscimol inactivation experiments, ~1 week after
surgery, rats underwent fear conditioning, extinction, and retrieval testing in either
the conditioning context (Context A) or the extinction context (Context B).
Auditory fear conditioning consisted of five tone (CS; 10 s, 80 dB, 2 kHz)-footshock
(US; 1.0 mA, 2 s) pairings with 60 s interstimulus intervals (ISIs). On the following
day, rats underwent fear extinction in which they received a 3 min stimulus-free BL
followed by 45 tone-alone presentations (30 s ISIs). Prior to the extinction session,
rats were exposed to the conditioning context for 35 min 30 s to extinguish fear
associated with the context. On the following two days, rats received a retrieval test
in the conditioning context to assess fear renewal and a subsequent test in the
extinction context to assess extinction retrieval. Each test consisted of a 10-min
stimulus-free baseline period followed by 5 CS presentations (30 s ISIs). Rats
received microinfusions of SAL or MUS into the RE 10-min before extinction
training or retrieval testing. The test order was counterbalanced such that
half of the rats received the renewal test first and the others received the retrieval
test first.
To assess the state-dependence of RE inactivation, rats underwent fear
conditioning, extinction and extinction retrieval testing as previously described.
One group of rats received MUS infusions in the RE before both extinction training
and the retrieval test and a second group of rats received SAL infusions before both
extinction and retrieval test. A third group of rats (No-ext) also received SAL
infusions, but they did not receive CS presentations during the extinction session.
To assess whether extinction retrieval is affected in same context, the animals were
conditioned and extinguished as described above. On the following 2 days, rats
received either infusions of SAL or MUS (counterbalanced across days) prior to the
retrieval test in the extinguished context to test the strength of the extinction
memory. On the subsequent two days, rats received either infusions of SAL or
MUS (counterbalanced across days) prior to the retrieval test in a novel non-
extinguished context to test for fear renewal.
To determine whether extinction training or retrieval testing activates the RE,
we examined Fos expression in the RE after these procedures. Rats underwent fear
conditioning and extinction as previously described (though in this experiment the
animals received three days of extinction training because they exhibited
particularly high levels of freezing). One group of rats (EXT) was sacrificed and
perfused 90 min after the first extinction session. Control rats (No-ext) stayed in
their home cage during first extinction and were sacrificed together with EXT rats.
After all extinction sessions, one group of rats underwent a renewal test (context A)
and a second group received an extinction retrieval test (context B); a third group
of rats (HOME) remained in their home cages during behavioral testing. Ninety-
minutes after testing, all rats were sacrificed and perfused for c-fos analysis.
For the intersectional DREADD experiments, rats underwent auditory fear
conditioning, extinction, retrieval testing 4–5 weeks after surgery as previously
described. Rats received SAL or CNO injections either 30 min before extinction
training or retrieval testing. For the encoding experiment, retrieval tests were
conducted in both the conditioning context (context A, renewal) and the
extinction context (context B, retrieval). For the retrieval, experiment animals
were only tested in the extinction context (context B, retrieval) using a within-
subjects procedure in which each animal served as its own control. That is, each
rat received either a SAL or CNO injection before each of two extinction
retrieval tests conducted over two days; test order was counterbalanced such
that half of the animals received SAL in their first test whereas the other half
received CNO in their first test.
For the terminal DREADD experiment, animals underwent surgery for viral
infusions into either PL or IL or both. Five weeks after this surgery, animals
underwent a second surgery to implant cannula targeting the RE. One week after
the second surgery, rats underwent auditory fear conditioning, extinction, retrieval
testing as previously described. Rats received infusions of SAL or CNO in RE 10
min before the retrieval testing using a within-subjects procedure in which each
animal served as its own control.
Electrophysiological recordings. For the in-vivo electrophysiological recording
experiment, a modified rodent conditioning chamber (30 × 24 × 21 cm) was used
for the extinction and testing sessions. This chamber was modified to allow for
awake, behaving recordings. One week after recovery from surgery, rats (n = 3)
underwent auditory fear conditioning in context A in which they were presented
with 3 CS-US (60 s ISI) pairings after a 3 min stimulus-free baseline period. On the
subsequent two days, rats underwent identical extinction sessions in context B in
which they were presented with 45 CS-alone trials (30 sec ISI) after a 3 min
stimulus-free baseline period. Twenty-four hours after the final extinction session,
rats received a single, weak unsignaled reminder shock (2 sec, 0.5 mA) in context A
after a 3-min baseline period.
On the fifth and final day of the experiment, rats received a dual-test session for
extinction retrieval (context B) and fear renewal (context C). These sessions
consisted of a 3 min baseline period followed by presentation of 5 CS-alone trials
(30 sec ISI). Three minutes after the final CS the recording system was paused and
rats were temporarily placed in a 5-gallon buck with bedding (the recording cable
remained connected), allowing us to record signal from the same neurons over

 both tests. During this time, the experimenters quickly changed the contextual
layout of the recording chamber (i.e., swapping from context B to context C). Rats
were then placed back into the recording chamber and underwent a second
retrieval session in the new context. This dual testing session enabled us to record
CS-elicited activity in the same single-units in both the retrieval and renewal
contexts.
Extracellular single-unit activity and freezing behavior were automatically
recorded with a multichannel neurophysiological recording system (OmniPlex,
Plexon, Dallas, TX). Wideband signals recorded on each channel were referenced
to one of two ground wires, amplified (8000×), digitized (40 kHz sampling rate),
and saved on a PC for offline sorting and analysis. After high-pass filtering
(600–6000 Hz), waveforms were sorted manually using 2D principal component
analysis (Offline Sorter, Plexon). Only well-isolated units with a signal-to-noise
ratio greater than 3 standard deviations were used in our analysis. We then
imported sorted waveforms and their timestamps to NeuroExplorer (Nex
Technologies, Madison, AL) for further analysis.
Histology. Rats were overdosed with sodium pentobarbital (Fatal Plus; 100 mg/ml,
0.5 ml) and were transcardially perfused with ice-cold saline and 10% formalin.
Brains from animals in the RE muscimol experiments were extracted and stored in
30% sucrose-formalin at 4 °C. Brains from animals in the DREADD experiments
were extracted and stored in 10% formalin for up to 24 h and then transferred to
30% sucrose at 4 °C for at least 48 h. Coronal brain sections (40 μm) were made on
a cryostat (−20 °C). For the animals only implanted with RE cannula, brain sec-
tions were mounted on subbed slides and stained with thionin (0.25%) to visualize
cannula placements. For animals expressing viruses in the mPFC, the sections were
mounted on subbed slides and coverslipped using fluoromount (Diagnostic Bio-
systems) to visualize viral expression.
Fos immunohistochemistry. Rats were overdosed with sodium pentobarbital
(Fatal Plus; 100 mg/ml, 0.5 ml) and were transcardially perfused with ice-cold
saline and 10% formalin. Brains were extracted and stored in 10% formalin for up
to 24 h and then transferred to 30% sucrose at 4 °C for at least 48 h. Coronal brain
sections (40 μm) were made on a cryostat (−20 °C). Brain sections were washed
three times in TBST and then were incubated in 0.3% H2O2 for 15 min. The tissue
was washed in TBS three times and was incubated in rabbit anti-c-Fos primary
antibody (1:1000; Millipore) overnight. Brain tissue was washed three times in TBS
followed by a 1-h incubation in a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody
(1:1000; Jackson Immunoresearch), amplification with the avidin biotin complex at
1:1000 (ABC; Vector labs), and visualization with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) +
nickel ammonium sulfate to yield a purple/black nuclear reaction product. Stained
brain sections were mounted on subbed slides, coverslipped with Permount, and
stored at room temperature until photographed using a Zeiss microscope (Axio
Imager).
Image analysis. To quantify c-fos expression, two images were taken at different
A/P levels (1.9 and 2.3 from bregma) at 10X magnification (895 μm × 670 μm;
0.596 mm2) of the midline thalamus. The number of Fos-positive neurons within
each image and brain region were averaged and divided by the surface area to
reveal the number of c-fos cells/mm2.
Data analysis. For the RE muscimol experiments, 16 out of 152 rats were excluded
from the analysis because RE cannula were misplaced or the animals did not
complete the experiment. This yielded the following group sizes: encoding
experiment (SAL, n = 14; MUS, n = 11), retrieval experiment (MUS = 15,Sal =
16), state-dependent experiment (SAL-SAL, n = 20; MUS-MUS, n = 20; No-ext, n
= 23) and context-independent retrieval experiment (COND, n = 6; NOVEL, n =
7). For the intersectional DREADD experiments, 14 of 56 rats had incomplete or
unilateral mPFC expression of AAV-hM4Di. This yielded the following group
sizes: encoding experiment (SAL, n = 19, CNO, n = 15), retrieval experiment (n =
7). For the terminal DREADD experiments, 28 out of 80 rats had incomplete or
unilateral mPFC expression of AAV-hM4Di and/or had misplaced RE cannulae
and were excluded from the analyses. This yielded the following group sizes: Blank-
GFP, n = 17; PL + IL DREADD, n = 14; PL DREADD, n = 12; IL DREADD, n =
9. All freezing data represent freezing behavior during the interstimulus intervals
(ISIs). The data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), and post-hoc
comparisons in the form of Fisher’s protected least significant difference (PLSD)
tests were performed after a significant overall F ratio in the ANOVA. For some
analyses, paired or unpaired t tests were used. All the data are represented as
means ± s.e.m.s.
