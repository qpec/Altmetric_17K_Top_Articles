Very rapid long-distance sea 
crossing by a migratory bird

Landbirds undertaking within-continent migrations have the possibility to stop en route, but most 
long-distance migrants must also undertake large non-stop sea crossings, the length of which can vary 
greatly. For shorebirds migrating from Iceland to West Africa, the shortest route would involve one of 
the longest continuous sea crossings while alternative, mostly overland, routes are available. Using 
geolocators to track the migration of Icelandic whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus), we show that they can 
complete a round-trip of 11,000 km making two non-stop sea crossings and flying at speeds of up to 
24 m s−1; one of the fastest recorded for shorebirds flying over the ocean. Although wind support could 
reduce flight energetic costs, whimbrels faced headwinds up to twice their ground speed, indicating 
that unfavourable and potentially fatal weather conditions are not uncommon. Such apparently 
high risk migrations might be more common than previously thought, with potential fitness gains 
outweighing the costs.
Recent advances in tracking movements of individual birds are revolutionising our understanding of avian migration1,2. 
New tracking technologies (e.g. geolocators and PTT transmitters) have revealed migratory journeys in excess 
of 5000 km of active flight1–3, setting the endurance exercise record of any animal4. Ultra long-distance contin-
uous migratory flights have been suggested to facilitate avoidance of predators, parasites and pathogens5, but 
such continuous exercise is also known to increase mortality risk4. Migratory landbirds typically avoid crossing 
large ecological barriers such as mountain-ranges, deserts and oceans6,7, often using routes over suitable habitats 
along which stopping to rest and refuel is possible, for example by following the edge of continental land-masses6. 
However, when detours from the shortest route considerably increase travel distance, energy or time, crossing 
ecological barriers may be beneficial1. Birds breeding at high latitudes are often those that undertake the longest 
non-stop flights, crossing oceans1,8–10, ice-caps11 and deserts2, but such long flights can incur high mortality risk 
due to exhaustion associated with prolonged unfavourable weather conditions6. Species migrating by flying long 
distances continuously over oceanic waters1,3,8,12 and land masses2 all undertake stop-overs during either both 
journeys2,3,8,12 or pre-nuptial migration only1,6. During pre-nuptial migration, the use of stop-over sites might 
allow gauging conditions closer to the Arctic and subarctic breeding grounds as arriving too early can also be 
disadvantageous if conditions are unsuitable upon arrival6. Additionally, by refuelling during migration, birds can 
restore body reserves thus increasing the likelihood of reaching the breeding grounds in good condition and at the 
right time6,13. Non-stop long distance flights over unsuitable habitats entail considerable survival risk as no shel-
tering options are available and future weather conditions in distant locations are impossible to predict14. Indeed 
the largest mortality events recorded on migration (5000–200 000 individuals15–18) refer to landbirds crossing large 
waterbodies and encountering adverse weather conditions6. However, favourable winds can also play a fundamen-
tal role in the crossing over large expanses of unsuitable habitat such as oceans6. Many species wait for tailwinds 
at coastal sites for several days before embarking on large sea crossings, departing only when wind subsidies are 
considerable6,14. If significant headwinds are encountered during oceanic flights, birds must endure substantially 
longer flight periods which can result in depletion of fat and muscles and exhaustion19. It is therefore expected that 
birds depart for long distance sea crossings with favourable tailwinds and that flight air speeds are as high as pos-
sible, independent of winds encountered en route, in order to reduce exposure to potentially adverse conditions.

Iceland hosts important populations of several migratory wader (or shorebird) species20 which winter 
in Europe and west Africa21,22. These species have to negotiate one of the longest continuous sea crossing of 
all Arctic and subarctic breeding landbirds6. Species migrating to west Africa (e.g. the Bijagós archipelago in 
Guinea-Bissau) could either undertake a non-stop oceanic flight (~5800 km) or, after an initial sea crossing 
(~800 km) to the UK, follow the continental land masses to the wintering grounds (~5200 km). Both alternatives 
result in similar distances and some Icelandic breeding waders are known to follow the coastline21, even those 
for which a single flight overwater is potentially feasible23. The extent to which either of these routes is used is 
not known and although the non-stop oceanic flight is potentially of higher risk, this will likely depend on wind 
conditions during migration. We deployed geolocator tags on Icelandic whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus islandi-
cus Brehm, 1831), a species which is known to winter in West Africa22 to investigate (1) if non-stop flights over 
oceanic waters between Iceland and West Africa are undertaken during autumn and spring migration; (2) the 
level of wind support encountered en route and how this affects flight speed.
Results and Discussion
Ten adult breeding Icelandic whimbrels were tagged with geolocators in June 2012 (Fig. 1), seven were recorded 
on their territories in June 2013, of which four tags with data were retrieved. During the post-nuptial migration 
in autumn 2012, all four whimbrels flew non-stop to their wintering areas in west Africa (Fig. 2),  covering dis-
tances of ~3900 to 5500 km in 5 days (Table 1) and, on occasion, achieving some of the fastest recorded speeds 
for terrestrial birds on long-distance flight over oceanic waters (up to 18–24 m s−1). During the return migra-
tion, two of these birds stopped for 11 (Male 2) and 15 days (Female 2), covering a total distance of ~10,500 and 
11,000 km, respectively. However, the remaining female and male completed the return migration in another

continuous flight (Fig. 2) for a total round trip of ~7800 (Female 1) and 11,000 (Male 1) km, respectively (Table 1). 
Completing such a long annual migration cycle in two long-distance flights is highly unusual for species where 
such studies have been undertaken. Only one other long-distance Arctic migrant wader, the Pacific Golden 
Plover (Pluvialis fulva), has been recorded undertaking such non-stop flights (ca. 9700 km total distance) between 
Alaska and Hawaii9. For this species however, no alternative route over coastal land masses is possible without 
considerably increasing flight distance.
In order to assess how wind conditions encountered on these journeys varied, particularly for flights with 
and without stopovers, we quantified wind support at each position just prior to and during the migratory flight. 
All four whimbrels departed Iceland in favourable wind conditions (i.e. tailwinds), but all four arrived in West 
Africa having faced headwinds, mostly in the later part of the journey (Fig. 3). Conversely, only one individual 
departed from the winter grounds in favourable wind conditions (Male 1, the earliest to depart), while all others 
departed in headwinds of 1.3–4.8 m s−1, with one individual encountering headwinds for virtually the entire 
journey, including after stopping-over (Female 2, Fig. 3). A pre-nuptial migration strategy involving a stopover 
is likely safer regarding potentially unfavourable weather conditions encountered en route and upon arrival, but 
stopping to refuel will reduce overall migration speed. Indeed, and despite all tracked individuals departing the 
wintering grounds at similar times (22nd–29th of April), those flying non-stop arrived before those that undertook 
a stopover. This includes the last individual to depart which flew non-stop (Female 1) and arrived at the breed-
ing grounds 6 to 10 days before the two individuals that made a stopover (of 11–15 days), thus overtaking its 
conspecifics23. The earlier arrival of the female and male that flew non-stop to Iceland could be advantageous if 
they capitalize by nesting early, as this is known to increase breeding success, particularly in Arctic and subarctic 
systems24. However, laying dates did not differ substantially between the individuals undertaking direct flights 
(20th–31st of May) or those that made a stopover (25th May–7th of June), suggesting that timing of breeding is 
constrained by other or additional factors, such as environmental conditions for nesting or timing of mate arrival 
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
The very fast ground speeds achieved by migrating whimbrels were influenced by the wind speeds encoun-
tered en route, particularly at altitudes of 1500 m (Table 2). Wind support at this altitude accounts for 4 to 36% 
of fastest speeds of each individual, with the highest wind assistance corresponding to the maximum recorded 
ground speed of 24.2 m s−1 (87 km h−1). Some individuals also reach very fasts speeds whilst facing headwinds 
which can be 2 to 40% of their ground speed, and in its most extreme case resulting in airspeed of 25.0 m s−1 
(90 km h−1; Female 2). Average speeds for the entire continuous migratory flight are similar to those of other 
species crossing oceans (50–65 km h−1 5,8,9) which are also strongly influenced by wind speed en route5. By flying 
at high speeds and non-stop over open ocean these species reduce the time on migration and might be using an 
“airspace corridor” to avoid predators, parasites and pathogens5. But if wind conditions at distant locations along 
the route are unfavourable, such migratory strategy can result in mortality by exhaustion, even after arriving at 
destination (TGG, pers. observation).
Our ability to track migration is providing new insights into the extraordinary capacity of birds to move 
extremely fast over very large distances, by continuously sustaining endurance exercise during several days. Wind 
support is crucial during such extreme journeys, but current predictions of changes in climatic patterns, specif-
ically changes on regional scale wind patterns25, can potentially have a considerably disproportionate negative 
effect on those species that regularly undertake non-stop long distance flights over unsuitable habitats. Variation 
in migratory strategies within the same population will likely allow coping with potential changes, but predicting 
such responses requires an understanding on how these migration strategies can arise and are maintained. In 
addition, by linking different migratory strategies to associated fitness consequences will be key in our ability to 
anticipate demographic changes for migratory populations.

Methods
Bird tracking. 
Given Icelandic whimbrels previously established adult return rate (ca. 60–80%)26, in June 
2012 we deployed 10 geolocators (Intigeo W65A9RJ, Migrate Technology) on breeding birds in South Iceland 
(63° 47N, 20° 12W). All individuals were caught with a nest trap (Moudry TR60; www.moudry.cz), ringed with 
metal and colour rings and measured to determine sex26. Seven of these birds were recorded breeding in the 
same location 12 months later, five of which (two females and three males) were re-captured and the geolocator 
collected. All of these individuals were from different pairs and the geolocator of one male was corrupted as a 
result of saltwater entering the device, leaving four individuals available for analysis. All animal handling and pro-
tocols were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations under licenses issued by Icelandic 
(Natural History Institute; license number 365) and International regulatory bodies (International Wader Study 
Group; license number 1235).
Positional data and flight speed. 
Light data from the geolocators were smoothed twice27 and used to 
estimate positions28 during migration (i.e. between Iceland and West Africa) using IntiProc (v. 1.03, Migrate

Technology, Ltd.) and “GeoLight” package in R29, assuming a sun elevation angle of − 
6° based on in situ geolo-
cator calibration prior to deployment. Total migration length, distance (great circle route) and speed were esti-
mated between the last and first positions on land in the breeding areas (Iceland) or wintering areas (W Africa). 
As geolocator positions are only attained at a minimum of 12 hours intervals, flight speed (time taken to cover 
the distance between two sequential positions-in m s−1) was estimated for each 12 hour flight segment defined as 
two sequential positions between the first location outside the breeding, wintering or stop-over areas and the first 
location on land (at breeding, wintering or stop-over areas).
Wind support. 
Wind data at the location (± 
2.5 degrees) and time of each geolocator recorded position was 
extracted from NOAA using the dataset Reanalysis by NCEP30. Headwind or tailwind vector between sequen-
tial positions was interpolated for three altitudes (1500, 3000 and 5500 m) using function “NCEP.interp” from 
package RNCEP31. To test at which altitude wind speed had an effect on ground speed, we built a GLMM with 
individual as random factor to control the non-independence and DFs were calculated using the Satterthwaite 
approximation in package lmerTest. All analysis and calculations were performed in R 2.15.032.

complete a round-trip of 11,000 km making two non-stop sea crossings and flying at speeds of up to 24 m s−1; one 
of the fastest recorded for shorebirds flying over the ocean”
.
In the Results and Discussion section,
“During the post-nuptial migration in autumn 2012, all four whimbrels flew non-stop to their wintering areas 
in west Africa (Fig. 2), covering distances of ~3900 to 5500 km in 5 days (Table 1) and, on occasion, achieving 
the fastest recorded speeds for terrestrial birds on long-distance flight over oceanic waters (up to 18–24 m s−1)”
