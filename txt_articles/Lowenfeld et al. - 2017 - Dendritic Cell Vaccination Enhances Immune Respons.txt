Abstract
Purpose: Vaccination with HER2 peptide-pulsed DC1s stimu-
lates a HER2-specific T-cell response. This randomized trial aimed
to establish safety and evaluate immune and clinical responses to
vaccination via intralesional (IL), intranodal (IN), or both intra-
lesional and intranodal (ILN) injection.
Experimental Design: Fifty-four HER2pos patients [42 pure
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 12 early invasive breast cancer
(IBC)] were enrolled in a neoadjuvant HER2 peptide-pulsed DC1
vaccine trial. Patients were randomized to IL (n ¼ 19), IN (n ¼ 19),
or ILN (n ¼ 16) injection. Immune responses were measured in
peripheral blood and sentinel lymph nodes by ELISPOT or in vitro
sensitization assay. Pathologic response was assessed in resected
surgical specimens.
Results: Vaccination by all injection routes was well toler-
ated. There was no significant difference in immune response
rates by vaccination route (IL 84.2% vs. IN 89.5% vs. ILN
66.7%; P ¼ 0.30). The pathologic complete response (pCR)
rate was higher in DCIS patients compared with IBC patients
(28.6% vs. 8.3%). DCIS patients who achieved pCR (n ¼ 12)
and who did not achieve pCR (n ¼ 30) had similar peripheral
blood
anti-HER2
immune
responses.
All
patients
who
achieved pCR had an anti-HER2 CD4 immune response in
the sentinel lymph node, and the quantified response was
higher by response repertoire (P ¼ 0.03) and cumulative
response (P ¼ 0.04).
Conclusions: Anti-HER2 DC1 vaccination is a safe and
immunogenic treatment to induce tumor-specific T-cell re-
sponses in HER2pos patients; immune and clinical responses
were similar independent of vaccination route. The immune
response in the sentinel lymph nodes, rather than in the periph-
eral blood, may serve as an endpoint more reflective of antitu-
mor activity. Clin Cancer Res; 23(12); 2961–71. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
Cancer progression is associated with immune dysregulation
and suppression. Cancer immunotherapy aims to sensitize and
restore a specific antitumor immune response. Our group has
shown that there is a progressive loss of the anti-HER2 Th1
immune response along the continuum of HER2pos breast cancer
(1), and we have developed anHER2 peptide-pulsed dendritic cell
(DC1) vaccine that is uniquely engineered to induce a strong anti-
HER2 immune response (2, 3). DC1s are particularly well-suited
for cancer vaccines due to their potent antigen-presenting capac-
ity, sensitizing both CD4pos (4) and CD8pos (5) T-cells to specific
antigens (6–8). Although CD8pos T cells, and cytotoxic T lym-
phocytes (CTL) in particular, have traditionally been viewed as the
primary effectors of antitumor immunity (9), CD4pos T cells have
more recently been shown to potentiate the CTL response (5, 10)
and contribute additional cytotoxicity (11–13).
DCs migrate to, or otherwise enter, secondary lymphoid
organs to interact with resident T lymphocytes (14, 15). DC
vaccines administered intravenously (16–18), subcutaneously
(18–20), or intranodally (18, 21, 22) have been shown to
induce a specific T-cell response. Direct intranodal administra-
tion obviates migration and may, therefore, be the most efficient
route of administration. In a murine model, DCs pulsed with
tumor lysate and injected intranodally resulted in greater sen-
sitization of T cells and improved antitumor responses com-
pared with intravenous or subcutaneous vaccination (23). In
our previous trial of the neoadjuvant DC1 vaccine in patients
with HER2pos ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), DCs were
injected into nonpathologic distant lymph nodes in the groin
under ultrasound guidance (3). In the current trial, we random-
ized patients to vaccination via intralesional (IL), intranodal

 (IN), or a combination of both intralesional and intranodal
(ILN) injections and compared immune and clinical responses.
The goals of this trial were to establish the safety of the various
routes of DC1 vaccination, to evaluate the immune and clinical
responses induced by the various routes of vaccination, and to
explore possible relationships between immune and clinical
responses.
Materials and Methods
Study design
This randomized selection design trial was approved by the
University of Pennsylvania's Institutional Review Board and reg-
istered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02061332). All patients
signed informed consent for the trial, and patients were random-
ized to one of three different routes of vaccine administration: (i)
our previously established protocol of ultrasound guided intra-
nodal injection (IN); (ii) intralesional injection (IL); and (iii)
both intralesional and intranodal injection (ILN).
In our previous trial, we found that a higher percentage of
patients with ERneg tumors (4/10, 40.0%) had no tumor at the
time of surgery [pathologic complete response (pCR)] compared
with patients with ERpos tumors (1/17, 5.9%; refs. 3, 24). Because
of the lower pCR rate in ERpos patients, the bidirectional cross-
talk between the estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 signaling
pathways demonstrated in preclinical studies (25, 26), and
the clinical benefits shown in dual blockade of ER and HER2
(26, 27), an amendment was approved during this trial to treat
subsequent ERpos patients with concurrent antiestrogen therapy.
After the 22nd patient (the seventh ERpos patient) was vaccinat-
ed, the subsequent 21 ERpos patients were prescribed antiestro-
gen therapy. None of the patients, including those with invasive
disease, received any other systemic treatment while enrolled in
the trial.
The primary goals of this trial were to establish the safety and
tolerability of the vaccine and to evaluate the immune response
generated by the three different routes of vaccination. The sec-
ondary goals of this trial were to measure the clinical response
following vaccination and explore possible relationships between
the immune and clinical outcomes.
Patient selection
Female patients �18 years of age with biopsy-proven
HER2pos DCIS, DCIS with microinvasion, DCIS with invasive
disease less than 5 mm, or Paget disease of the nipple who had
not yet received definitive treatment were eligible for the trial.
Patients whose DCIS was eliminated by excisional biopsy at
diagnosis were not eligible. The Hercept (Dako) antibody was
used to analyze HER2 expression. HER2 positivity was defined
as >5% of tumor population with 2þ or 3þ staining by IHC
verified by a single pathologist (P.J. Zhang). Each patient
underwent a breast MRI scan prior to vaccination to document
the initial extent of disease and exclude patients with macro-
scopic invasive foci. Pregnant or lactating women were exclud-
ed from the trial. Women with cardiac dysfunction, immune
deficiencies, coagulopathies, or a preexisting medical illness or
medication, which might interfere with the study, were exclud-
ed from the trial. Fifty-eight women enrolled in the trial and
signed informed consent; one patient's tumor was reclassified
as HER2neg upon review, 2 patients voluntarily withdrew prior
to the first leukapheresis, and one patient had an inadequate
collection of cells by leukapheresis, yielding a final cohort of 54
patients (Supplementary Fig. S1). Demographic and clinical
data were obtained from the electronic medical record.
Vaccination procedure
Vaccine preparation has been described in detail previously
(2, 3, 24, 28). Briefly, patients underwent tandem apheresis/
countercurrent centrifugal elutriation to isolate monocytic DC
precursors. Cells were pulsed with six HER2 MHC class II binding
peptides (American Peptide Corporation): three extracellular
domain peptides (42-56, 98-114, 328-345) and three intracellu-
lar domain peptides (776-790, 927-941, 1166-1180), and rapidly
matured to a DC1 phenotype by adding IFNg (Actimmune;
1,000 U/mL) and LPS (gift from Dr. Anthony Suffredini, NIH,
Bethesda, MD; 10 mg/mL). The monocytes of HLA-A2pos and
HLA-A3pos patients were also pulsed with two HER2 MHC class I
binding peptides, 369-377 and 689-697. Six weekly injections of
1–2 � 107 HER2 peptide-pulsed DC1s were administered into the
breast (IL; n¼ 19),into the groinlymph nodes (IN; n ¼19), orhalf
of the dose into the breast and half of the dose into the groin
lymph nodes (ILN; n ¼ 16).
Following each weekly vaccination, patients were moni-
tored for adverse effects for a minimum of 1 to 2 hours.
Each patient underwent cardiac evaluation including multi-
gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram prior to
vaccination and within 2 weeks of the final vaccination. All
adverse events were classified by NCI Common Toxicity
Criteria (NCI-CTC version 3.0).
Outcome measures
Immune monitoring. Systemic anti-HER2 CD4pos T-cell responses
were measured in 53 of 54 patients pre- and postvaccination,
systemic anti-HER2 CD8pos T-cell responses were measured in 22
HLA-A2pos patients pre- and postvaccination, and localized anti-
HER2 CD4pos T-cell responses were measured postvaccination in
the regional, sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in 40 patients who
underwent SLN biopsy. HER2-specific IFNg production was mea-
sured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays
or by in vitro sensitization assays, as previously described in detail
(10, 29).
Translational Relevance
In this randomized selection design trial, we confirmed that
neoadjuvant DC1 vaccination is a safe and immunogenic
treatment in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and early invasive
breast cancer (IBC), inducing a tumor-specific T-cell response
in the peripheral blood and the sentinel lymph nodes inde-
pendent of the route of vaccination (intralesional, intranodal,
or both intralesional and intranodal). The pathologic com-
plete response (pCR) rate was similar across all three injection
routes, but was higher in patients with DCIS than in patients
with stage I IBC. In DCIS patients, immune responses detected
in the sentinel lymph nodes, but not peripheral blood, were
associated with pCR. These findings suggest that (i) vaccines
are more effective in DCIS and warrant further evaluation in
DCIS or other minimal disease settings; and (ii) the local
regional sentinel lymph node may serve as a more meaningful
immunologic endpoint.

 Briefly, ELISPOT PVDF membrane plates (Mabtech Inc.] were
coated overnight with anti-IFNg capture antibody (1D1K). The
following day, after the plates were washed with PBS (Mediatech
Inc.) and blocked with 10% human serum/DMEM, 2 � 105
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, immature or mature DCs,
or SLN cells were plated in each well either unstimulated, pulsed
with HER2-derived class II peptide (4 mg; 42-56, 98-114, 328-345,
776-790, 927-941, 1166-1180), or pulsed with anti-human CD3
and CD28 antibodies (0.5 mg/mL; positive control; BD Pharmin-
gen). The plates were incubated at 37�C þ 5% CO2 for 24 to 36
hours. After the plates were washed with PBS, 100 mL of detection
antibody (1 mg/mL; 7 B6-1-biotin) was added to each well, and
the plates were incubated for 2 hours. After the plates were washed
again with PBS, 100 mL of 1:1,000 diluted streptavidin–HRP was
added to each well, and the plates were incubated for another
hour. TMB substrate solution was added to reveal spot formation.
Spot-forming cells (SFC) were counted using an automated reader
(ImmunoSpot CTL). By ELISPOT, a positive response to an
individual HER2 peptide was defined as a minimum of 20
SFC/2 � 105 cells after subtracting the unstimulated background.
Two immune response metrics based on the six class II HER2
peptides were used to quantify the immune response: (i) response
repertoire (the number of peptides to which a patient responded,
range: 0–6); and (ii) cumulative response (the sum of the SFCs
across all six class II HER2 peptides).
Alternatively, CD4pos or CD8pos T cells were selected from the
cryopreserved 120 to 140 lymphocyte cell fractions via negative
selection (STEMCELL Technologies) for in vitro sensitization.
Autologous DC1s were suspended in serum-free medium (Invi-
trogen) with GM-CSF (10 ng/mL), pulsed with one of six class II
HER2 peptides (42-56, 98-114, 328-345, 776-790, 927-941,
1166-1180) or a class I HER2 peptide (10 mg/mL; 369-377), and
cocultured with CD4pos or CD8pos T cells at a ratio of 10:1.
interleukin-2 (30 IU/mL; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added
on day 2. On day 10, T cells were harvested and were tested against
T2 target cells pulsed with either the class II or class I HER2 peptide
or irrelevant controls (p53 and colon cancer peptide). After
24 hours, the supernatant was harvested and analyzed by ELISA.
By ELISA, a positive response to an individual HER2 peptide
was defined as a 2-fold increase in CD4pos or CD8pos HER2
peptide-specific T-cell IFNg production compared with the irrel-
evant peptide control. Again, the response repertoire was used to
quantify the CD4pos immune response.
As defined in the protocol, a patient was considered to be an
immuneresponderbymeetingatleastoneofthefollowingcriteria:
(i) the cumulative CD4pos response increased by 2-fold (postvac-
cination cumulative response/prevaccination cumulative response
>2) and the postvaccination cumulative CD4pos response was
greater than 20 SFC/106 cells after subtracting the unstimulated
background (by ELISPOT); (ii) the response to an individual
CD4pos peptide increased by 2-fold (postvaccination peptide
response/prevaccination peptide response >2) and the postvacci-
nation peptide response was greater than 20 SFC/2 � 105 cells after
subtracting the unstimulated background (by ELISPOT); or (iii)
the postvaccination ELISA showed a new specific response to a
CD4 or CD8 HER2 peptide (HER2 peptide/control � 2) that was
not present prevaccination (HER2 peptide/control < 2).
Clinical monitoring. Subjects had a clip placed at the site of
microcalcification under stereotactic guidance at the time of
biopsy to serve as a marking site for future resection. Pathologic
response was measured in the resected specimen: lumpectomy
(n ¼ 38) or mastectomy (n ¼ 16). A pCR was defined as no DCIS
or invasive breast cancer (IBC) found in the entire resected
specimen. Rates of pCR were reported separately for pure DCIS
and early IBC.
Statistical analysis
A ranking and selection design procedure (30) was employed to
select the best treatment arm with regards to immune response
rate. The sample size of 18 patients per arm ensured that if there
was a 20% difference in true immune response rates between the
best and second best arms and a 10% difference between second
best and worst arms and assuming the best arm had a true
immune response rate of 80% to 95%, then the probability of
correctly selecting the superior arm exceeded 88%. The final
sample sizes per arm varied slightly from the target of 18 patients,
due to the introduction of a stratification by ER status after the
amendment, which added concurrent antiestrogen therapy in the
treatment of ERpos patients.
Descriptive statistics were employed to characterize distribu-
tions of variables and of outcomes. Continuous variables were
described by mean, SEM, median, and 25th and 75th percentiles.
Categorical variables were described by frequencies and percent-
age. Normality of continuous variables was examined by normal
probability plots. Comparisons of continuous variables by route
of administration were conducted by ANOVA or nonparametric
Kruskal–Wallis test, as appropriate. Two-group comparisons were
conducted by Student t test or nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum
test. Pre-vaccine to post-vaccine comparisons were conducted by
paired t test or Wilcoxon signed rank test. Comparisons of
categorical variables by route of administration were conducted
by Fisher exact test. Immune response rates and exact 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were computed, and rates were com-
pared by route of administration by Fisher exact test. Rates of pCR
by route of administration and associations between immune
measures and pCR were reported for DCIS patients. Absolute
increases (post-vaccine – pre-vaccine) of response repertoire and
fold increases (post-vaccine/pre-vaccine) of cumulative response
were calculated to adjust for the pre-vaccine immune levels. All
P values were two-sided. Statistical analyses were conducted in
IBM SPSS v23.0 (30).
Results
Between July 2009 and July 2015, 54 patients were treated on
this trial. The median age was 55 years (range, 35–83), and the
majority of patients were postmenopausal (84.0%) and white
(80.2%). Most tumors were high grade (71.7%) with 3þ HER2
expression (64.8%). Biopsy prior to vaccination diagnosed DCIS
in a vast majority of patients (n ¼ 51, 94.4%); however, 9 patients
who were initially diagnosed with DCIS were found to have
invasive disease in the final surgical specimen, representing a
17.6% upstaging at the time of resection, and leading to a cohort
of 12 patients diagnosed with IBC. The three patients that were
initially diagnosed with IBC were all HER2 positive by American
Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists
guidelines (31). Most patients were treated with lumpectomy
(59.3%), but only a minority of patients who underwent lump-
ectomy received postoperative radiation (38.3%). Randomized
treatment allocation was as follows: 19 patients (35.2%) received
IL injections, 19 patients (35.2%) received IN injections, and 16

 patients (29.6%) received ILN injections (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar across all
three treatment groups as summarized in Table 1.
Route of vaccine injection and ER status do not impact vaccine
safety
Overall, the vaccine was well tolerated with only grade 1
(n ¼ 37, 68.5%) and grade 2 (n ¼ 15, 27.8%) adverse events
reported. The most commonly reported adverse events associated
with the vaccine were fatigue (n ¼ 22, 40.7%), injection site
reaction (n ¼ 22, 40.7%), and chills/rigors (n ¼ 14, 25.9%). All of
the patients received all six vaccine injections, and none of the
patients withdrew from the trial due to the experienced side
effects. The route of injection did not affect the risk of adverse
events with grade 1–2 vaccine-related adverse events reported in
73.7% of patients who received IL injections, 68.4% of patients
who received IN injections, and 75.0% of patients who received
ILN injections. Only 2 patients exhibited asymptomatic declines
in left ventricular ejection fraction (EF); one patient who received
IL injection exhibited a decrease in EF to 55% (an 18% decrease),
which subsequently returned to baseline within 30 days, and one
patient who received ILN injection exhibited a decrease in EF to
49% on MUGA (a 28% decrease), which was attributed to PVCs
and was not evident when immediately reevaluated by echocar-
diogram (EF, 60%–65%).
ER status and concurrent treatment with antiestrogen therapy
also did not affect the experience of adverse events. In fact, ERpos
patients who were treated with combination antiestrogen therapy
and DC1 vaccination reported a lower rate of adverse events
(61.9%) compared with ERpos patients who did not receive
antiestrogen therapy and were treated with vaccination alone
(75.0%) or ERneg patients (80.0%) who were treated with vacci-
nation alone.
Immune responses increase following vaccination independent
of the injection route
On the basis of 53 vaccinated patients evaluable for immune
responses, 43 (81.1%) had new or increased immune responses

 (either CD4 or CD8 anti-HER2 immune responses) detected in
the peripheral blood following vaccination. The immune
response rates (exact 95% CI) by route of vaccination were as
follws: IL 84.2% (60.4%–96.6%), IN 89.5% (66.9%–98.7%), and
ILN 66.7% (38.4%–88.2%; Table 2). By the ranking and selection
design, in which the arm with the highest observed rate is selected,
the IN arm could be selected, although IL and ILN arms had
similar immune responses, and there was no significant difference
in immune response rate among the three arms (P ¼ 0.30). The
immune response rates were similar for vaccinated ERneg patients
(83.3%) and ERpos patients (87.5%), but was slightly lower for the
vaccinated ERpos patients who were treated with concurrent
antiestrogen therapy (76.2%; Supplementary Table S1).
We also examined the CD4pos Th1 immune response in a
quantified manner using two metrics: response repertoire and
cumulative response. Overall, the quantified CD4pos Th1 immune
response in the peripheral blood significantly increased from
prevaccination to postvaccination, in response repertoire [median
(25th–75th percentile), 0 (0–2) to2 (1–4), P < 0.001; Fig. 1A], and
cumulative response [48.6 (18.5–102.5) to 132.2 (72.5–238.5),
P ¼ 0.0001; Fig. 1B]. By each injection route, the quantitative
response significantly increased from prevaccination to postvac-
cination by response repertoire [IL, 0 (0–1) to 2 (1–3), P ¼ 0.001;

repertoire was similar across all three injection routes [IL, 1 (1–2);
IN, 2 (1–3); ILN, 1 (0–2); P ¼ 0.16; Fig. 1E], and the fold increase
in cumulative response was also similar across all three injection
routes [IL, 2.2 (1.6–4.4); IN, 2.3 (1.6–7.9); ILN, 2.2 (1.2–5.7); P ¼
0.81; Fig. 1F]. The quantified immune responses for each patient
are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2.
In the HLA-A2pos patients, the peripheral blood CD8pos T-cell
response rate increased from 3 of 22 patients (13.6%), exhibiting
an HER2-specific response prevaccination to 16 of 22 patients
(72.7%) postvaccination (P ¼ 0.0002, McNemar test). The 3
patients who exhibited a prevaccination anti-HER2 CD8pos T-cell
response maintained the response, and an additional 13 patients
developed a new anti-HER2 CD8pos T-cell response. There was no
significant difference in the CD8pos T-cell response across all three
injection routes, although the rate was lowest for the IN group
(P ¼ 0.17; Table 2)
Of 40 patients evaluable for quantified CD4pos Th1 immune
response in the SLN, 32 (80%) had a HER2-specific response;
median response repertoire was 2 (25th–75th percentile, 1–5),
and median cumulative response was 76.5 (23.5–209.5).
Although the postvaccination SLN immune response showed the
highest immune response rate in the IN group (91.7%), it was not
significantly higher than the rates in the IL (71.4%; P ¼ 0.33) or
ILN (78.6%; P ¼ 0.60) groups (Table 2). The quantified SLN
response repertoire (P ¼ 0.60; Fig. 1G) and cumulative response
(P ¼ 0.56; Fig. 1H) were also similar across all three injection
routes. By definition, evaluation of the SLN immune response was
limited to the postvaccination response at the time of lympha-
denectomy and could not be compared with prevaccination
immune levels. In addition, the limited nodal specimens were
only examined for the CD4pos, but not the CD8pos, responses.
We compared the immune responses in patients with DCIS
(n ¼ 42) and patients with stage I IBC (n ¼ 12). DCIS and IBC
patients had similar immune response rates (Table 3) and
similar increases in the quantified response repertoire (Supple-
mentary Fig. S3A) and cumulative response (Supplementary
Fig. S3B).
Clinical responses are associated with increased SLN immune
response, but not peripheral immune response
Clinically, 13 patients had no disease in the surgical specimen
at the time of surgical resection, achieving a pCR. Patients with
DCIS achieved a higher rate of pCR (12/42, 28.6%) compared
with patients with invasive disease (1/12, 8.3%). We further
investigated the pCR rate in DCIS patients. Patient variables (age,
BMI, race, menopausal status, and comorbidities) and tumor
variables (grade, ER, PR, and HER2 status) were not different
between DCIS patients who achieved a pCR and DCIS patients
who did not achieve a pCR. In DCIS patients, the rate of pCR was
similar by route of injection (IL, 23.1%; IN, 31.3%; ILN, 30.8%;
Supplementary Table S2). The pCR rate was similar for ERneg DCIS
patients who underwent vaccination alone (31.5%) and ERpos
DCIS patients who underwent vaccination with concurrent anti-
estrogen therapy (33.3%). Interestingly, none of the five ERpos
DCIS patients who underwent vaccination alone and did not
receive concurrent antiestrogen therapy achieved a pCR. Finally,
the pCR rate was higher in the 21 HLA-A2neg DCIS patients
compared with the pCR rate in the 21 HLA-A2pos DCIS patients
(38.1% vs. 19.0%); however, this difference was not statistically
significant (P ¼ 0.3). Furthermore, comparing the patients who
underwent vaccination with both class I and class II peptides
(HLA-A2pos or HLA-A3pos patients; n ¼ 30) with the patients
who underwent vaccination with the class II peptides alone
(HLA-A2negA3neg; n ¼ 12) showed more similar rates of pCR
(26.7% vs. 33.3%; P ¼ 0.7). As vaccination led to similar immune
and pathologic responses regardless of the injection route, ER

 status, or HLA typing in patients with DCIS, we further explored
the relationship between the immune response and the clinical
response.
In the peripheral blood, DCIS patients who achieved a pCR and
DCIS patients who did not achieve a pCR had similar overall
immune response rates (Table 4) and similar increases in the
quantified CD4 response repertoire (Supplementary Fig. S4A)
and cumulative response (Supplementary Fig. S4B) following
vaccination. However, the DCIS patients who achieved a pCR
started with a slightly higher quantified CD4 immune response in
the peripheral blood, as measured by both median response
repertoire (1 vs. 0) and median cumulative response (94 vs. 34).
In contrast, a more robust response was detected in the SLN in
the DCIS patients who achieved a pCR compared with the DCIS
patients who failed to achieve a pCR. All 7 of the DCIS patients
who achieved a pCR had an anti-HER2 immune response detected
in the SLN (Table 4). Furthermore, the postvaccination–quanti-
fied immune response in the SLN was higher in the pCR group
than in the non-pCR group as measured by both response
repertoire (median 5.0 vs. 1.0, P ¼ 0.03; Fig. 2A) and cumulative
response (243.0 vs. 52.0, P ¼ 0.04; Fig. 2B). Regardless of the route
of vaccination, the response repertoire in the SLN was higher in
the DCIS patients who achieved pCR (median IL, 3.5 vs. 1.0; IN,
3.5 vs. 2.5; ILN, 5.0 vs. 1.0; Fig. 2C), and the cumulative response
in the SLN was higher in the patients who achieved pCR (IL, 217.5
vs. 24.5; IN, 187.0 vs. 66.0; ILN, 243.0 vs.58.0; Fig. 2D).
Discussion
This study confirmed that neoadjuvant DC1-based vaccination
in early breast cancer is safe and immunogenic. Furthermore, the
immune and clinical responses induced by DC1 vaccination were
similar regardless of the route of vaccine administration. How-
ever, a higher rate of pCR was achieved in the DCIS patients
compared with the IBC patients. Finally, the clinical response in
DCIS patients correlated with the immune response detected in
the SLN, but not the immune response detected in the peripheral
blood.
In this study, HER2 peptide-pulsed DC1 vaccination was well
tolerated with only mild adverse events reported. Fatigue, injec-
tion site reaction, and chills/rigors were the most commonly
reported adverse events, without evidence of immunotherapy-
induced autoimmunity or irreversible cardiac toxicity. We specif-
ically compared three routes of vaccination: IL, IN, or ILN.
Previous studies have shown that migration of DCs to the
lymph nodes is required for induction of immune response
(32) and imaged the migration of DCs injected intradermally,
subcutaneously, or intranodally to the draining lymph node
regions (32–34). Theoretically, direct intranodal injection may
be expected to be more effective because the DCs would be placed
directly at the site of T-sensitization; however, in these studies,
despite fewer DCs arriving at the lymph nodes following intra-
dermal injection than intranodal injection, similar immune
responses were detected in the peripheral blood regardless of the
route of vaccination (34, 35). Similarly, in this study, our analysis
of the immune response did not show any significant differences
by route, but may be limited by small sample sizes. Specifically,
the CD8 immune response was only measured in the peripheral
blood and was only measured in 22 patients, and therefore, the
lower rate of CD8 responders in the IN group (n ¼ 7) did not
achieve statistical significance. In addition, in the ILN group, we
hypothesize that the rate of immune responders may be lower

 because the vaccination dose was split in half, with half of the dose
injected into the breast and half of the dose injected into the
lymph node. Nevertheless, despite the half doses delivered at each
injection site and the lower immune response rate in the ILN
group, the clinical response in the ILN group was similar. Overall,
the current study demonstrated that the vaccine was equally
tolerated with similar adverse events by all routes of injection,
and the immune and clinical response rates following vaccination
were similar regardless of the route of vaccination.
The main goal of DC vaccination, and consequently the main
outcome measured in clinical trials, is stimulation of antigen-
specific T cells that recognize and eliminate tumor cells. In a meta-
analysis of 29 trials involving more than 900 patients using DCs as
cellular
adjuvants,
antigen-specific
cellular
immunity
was
induced in 77% of patients with prostate cancer and 61% of
patients with renal cell carcinoma (36). In this trial, 81% of
patients developed an HER2-specific immune response following
vaccination. Despite the favorable safety profile and high immu-
nogenicity, DC-based vaccination has been heavily criticized for
the disappointing and variable clinical responses (37–39). In a
systematic review of all published clinical trials, the objective
clinical responses following DC vaccination were much more
limited: 7.1% in patients with prostate cancer, 8.5% in patients
with melanoma, 11.5% in patients with renal cell carcinoma, and
15.6% in patients with malignant glioma (39). These rates are
similar to the pCR rate we found in patients with IBC (8.3%), and,
in this context, the 28.6% rate of pCR in DCIS patients is even
more impressive. Of note, in this study, we chose to analyze
patients based on the final pathology found in the resected
specimen, rather than the pathology found in the diagnostic
biopsy. Diagnostic biopsy caries a risk of sampling error, and the
rate of upstaging found in this study (17.6%) is similar to rates
reported in the literature (40–42). On the other hand, progression
from DCIS to IBC over the course of the 6 weeks of vaccination is
very unlikely. Therefore, we chose to include those patients who
were diagnosed with IBC in the definitive surgical specimen in the
group of IBC patients. Alternatively, if we had grouped the
patients based on the initial biopsy results, there would have
been only 3 patients in the IBC group and 51 patients in the DCIS
group. Of the 51 patients initially diagnosed with DCIS on biopsy,
12 achieved a pCR leading to a pCR rate of 23.5%, only slightly
less than the 28.6% pCR rate in the group of DCIS patients
diagnosed by final pathology.
We have previously argued that DC-based vaccines may be
more effective in patients with preinvasive/early-stage disease
with a smaller tumor burden and preserved anti-HER2 Th1
immunity (1, 2), and similar studies using vaccination in pre-
invasive cervical lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3)

 have also led to similar rates of regression (30%;ref. 43).Although
the DCIS patients and the IBC patients had similar immune
response rates in this study, the rate of pCR was higher in DCIS
patients, suggesting that immunotherapy may be more effective in
DCIS. We have previously shown that there is a progressive loss of
the anti-HER2 Th1 immune response along the continuum of
HER2pos breast cancer; DCIS patients have a diminished immune
response, and the immune response is nearly absent in patients
with IBC (1). The anti-HER2 CD4 Th1 response prior to vacci-
nation may distinguish patients with pure DCIS from those with
DCIS and IBC, as the DCIS patients have a higher CD4 Th1
response than the patients with IBC. Measuring the prevaccina-
tion immune response may allow us to successfully identify and
treat DCIS patients with preserved immune responses. In addi-
tion, in future studies, response rates in both DCIS and IBC may be
further improved by prolonged vaccination regimens to boost
responses, the addition of targeted therapies, such as trastuzumab
and pertuzumab, to decrease tumor proliferation, or modification
of the tumor microenvironment to enhance migration of activat-
ed lymphocytes to tumor regions (44).
Criticisms of DC-based vaccination point to the discordance
between the immune and clinical responses. Vaccination has been
shown to induce an immune response in the peripheral blood
without leading to clinical tumor regression and, conversely, lead
to tumor regression without inducing an immune response (45).
In this study, both the CD4pos and the CD8pos immune responses
in the peripheral blood increased following vaccination; however,
neither was associated with the pathologic response rate. On the
other hand, the anti-HER2 CD4 Th1 response measured in the
SLN was significantly higher in the patients who achieved pCR
compared with the patients who did not achieve a pCR, suggesting
that the SLN immune response better reflects the pathologic
response.
In our comparison of DCIS patients who achieved a pCR with
DCIS patients who failed to achieve a pCR, both the rate of CD4
immune responders and the rate of CD8 immune responders in
the peripheral blood were lower in the group of patients who
achieved a pCR. Despite the lack of statistical significance, we can
speculate that the lower rate of immune responders in the pCR
group may be due to the congregating of the immune response in
the SLN. In patients who achieved a pCR, the circulating immune
response rate may be lower because the T cells home to the SLN to
gain access to the tumor. The higher CD4 immune response rate in
the SLN in the group of patients who achieved a pCR further
supports this theory that the immune response concentrated in
the SLN successfully attacks the tumor. An analogous study of the
immune response in patients with acute bacterial soft tissue
infections identified activated CD4pos and CD8pos T cells in the
peripheral blood and at the site of infection, but found that only
CD4pos and CD8pos T cells harvested from the infected site (but
not CD4pos or CD8pos T cells in the peripheral blood of the same
patients) expressed CXCR6 and produced IFNg, suggesting a
uniquely local role for CD4 and CD8 T cells in host defense (46).
The discrepancy between the peripheral blood immune
response and the clinical response is also particularly apparent
when examining the groups by ER status. The ERpos patients who
were treated with antiestrogen had a noticeably lower proportion
of immune responders measured in the peripheral blood, but a
higher rate of pCR. In the SLN, the immune response was higher in
the ERpos patients who received concurrent DC1 vaccination and
antiestrogen therapy compared with the ERpos patients who
received DC1 vaccination alone, supporting the importance of
the immune response in the SLN. This study was not powered to
evaluate the addition of antiestrogen therapy to vaccine therapy,
and the lack of statistical significance is likely due to the small
numbers in this study. Combination anti-HER2 vaccination and
antiestrogen therapy is more completely examined in our overall
institutional experience (13).
This study is subject to limitations that warrant emphasis.
First, the anti-HER2 immune responses were not measured at
the level of the tumor. We have previously reported an increase in
periductal lymphocytic infiltration at the site of residual DCIS
following DC1 vaccination (10). However, given that DCIS
lesions are small, most patients did not have sufficient tissue to
assess the pre- and/or post anti-HER2–specific lymphocytic infil-
trate, and there were no immunohistochemical or immunofluo-
rescent signs of the former DCIS lesion in those patients who
achieved a pCR. To overcome this obstacle, we investigated the
closest pathologic sample, the regional draining SLN. The SLN
was an appealing media to measure the immune response as SLN
biopsy is frequently part of standard treatment and would not add
any additional morbidity or mortality. Furthermore, the SLN
immune response could be compared between DCIS patients
who achieved pCR and DCIS patients who failed to achieve pCR.
Second, the findings of this study also leave the cause and effect of
the association between the SLN immune response and the
clinical response open to question. By definition, the SLN
immune response cannot be examined pre- and postvaccination
to measure the immune response induced by vaccination. Fur-
thermore, the results of this study do not distinguish whether the
increased tumor-specific immune response is caused by the expo-
sure to destroyed tumor or induces tumor destruction. In either
case, the antitumor Th1 immune response measured in the SLN
may better reflect antitumor activity and serve as a marker for
response to immunotherapy. Further studies of immunotherapy
may more thoroughly evaluate the immune response in the
peripheral blood, the SLN, and the tumor to correlate more
meaningfully with the clinical response.
In summary, this trial showed that DC1 vaccination remained
safe and well tolerated independent of the route of vaccination.
DC1 vaccination was also equally effective in inducing immune
and clinical responses independent of the route of vaccination.
The clinical response was much higher in DCIS patients compared
with IBC patients, and DCIS patients who achieved a pCR showed
a higher immune response measured in the SLN. The SLN has
been extensively evaluated for its prognostic and therapeutic
capacity with respect to tumor progression. We suggest that the
SLN may also be evaluated for its immunologic properties and
that future trials may further explore the immune response
detected in the SLN as an endpoint to better evaluate immune-
based therapies.
