OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to examine the relationship between distinct tobacco smoke 
exposure (TSE) measures and TSE-related symptoms and emergency department (ED)  
and/or urgent care (UC) use among nonsmoking adolescents without asthma diagnoses.
METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of 7389 adolescents who completed the 
Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study wave 2. Logistic regression and 
Poisson regression models were built.
RESULTS: Adolescents with TSE were at increased risk of reporting: shortness of breath, 
finding it hard to exercise, wheezing during or after exercise, and dry cough at night. 
Adolescents who lived with a smoker and had home TSE were at increased odds of 
reporting wheezing or whistling in the chest, and only adolescents with home TSE were 
at increased risk of reporting wheezing that disturbed sleep. Adolescents with TSE were 
less likely to report very good or excellent overall health and physical health but were 
more likely to report they sometimes, often, or very often missed school because of illness. 
Participants who lived with a smoker and had TSE ≥1 hour were more likely to have had 
an ED and/or UC visit. Participants with any TSE were at increased risk of having a higher 
number of ED and/or UC visits.
CONCLUSIONS: Different TSE measures uniquely increased the risk of TSE-related symptoms, 
but any TSE increased the risk of having a higher number of ED and/or UC visits. The 
providers at these high-volume settings should offer interventions to adolescents who 
are exposed to tobacco smoke and their families to decrease these symptoms and related 
morbidity.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Tobacco smoke 
exposure (TSE) may contribute to lower overall 
health and increased acute health care visits. 
Evidence is lacking regarding the consequences of 
TSE on related symptoms, other health indicators, 
and health care visits among nonsmoking 
adolescents without asthma diagnoses.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: TSE increases the risk 
of respiratory symptoms, including shortness of 
breath and dry cough at night. Adolescents with 
TSE were also at increased risk of having a higher 
number of emergency department or urgent care 
visits.

 Despite significant progress in 
tobacco control, 9.6 million US 
adolescents are exposed to tobacco 
smoke.1, 
 
2 Eliminating tobacco 
smoke exposure (TSE) is the only 
way to protect nonsmokers.3, 
 
4 
Evidence reveals that adolescents 
who are exposed to tobacco smoke 
are at substantial risk for cough, 
wheeze, acute respiratory infections, 
pneumonia, ear problems, and 
asthma.5, 
 
6 Although TSE is a well-
recognized risk factor among 
children with asthma, 
7 little is known 
about related symptomatology in 
adolescents without asthma. In 
addition, TSE-attributable illnesses 
may contribute to increased school 
absenteeism, with researchers 
indicating that when children live 
with a greater number of smokers, 
they have more missed school days.8 
Additionally, an inverse relationship 
between physical activity and 
active smoking has been reported 
in adolescents.9 Active and passive 
smoking have been associated 
with lower overall health.10 It is 
important to assess the relationship 
between types of TSE and potential 
TSE-attributable symptoms and 
other health indicators to inform 
intervention content that is aimed 
at reducing TSE among adolescents 
without asthma diagnoses.
Emergency departments (EDs) care 
for >4 million pediatric patients with 
potential TSE-related diagnoses 
(ie, upper respiratory infections or 
ear infections) annually.11 Children 
and adolescents who are exposed, 
as measured by parent report and 
serum cotinine (which is an ideal 
TSE biomarker), 
12 are up to 3.5 
times more likely to seek care at 
EDs.13, 
 
14 Adolescents have high ED 
use for nonurgent and semiurgent 
complaints, including preventive 
primary care, 
11, 
 
15, 
 
16 but little is 
known about the relationship 
between TSE and ED use among 
adolescents. Much of the literature 
is focused on younger children, 
17 
broad age ranges, 
13, 
14 and children 
and adolescents with asthma7, 
 
18, 
 
19 
and has limited self-report measures 
of parental smoking status and 
exposure to indoor tobacco smoke to 
define TSE.20
Our purpose was to examine the 
relationship between 3 distinct TSE 
measures and TSE-related symptoms 
and other health indicators among 
adolescents without asthma 
diagnoses. We hypothesized that 
adolescents with TSE would be 
more likely to report TSE-related 
symptoms and miss school because 
of illness but less likely to report 
very good or excellent overall health 
and physical health than unexposed 
adolescents. We assessed the 
association between TSE and ED and 
urgent care (UC) use. We posited that 
adolescents with TSE would be at 
increased risk for higher ED and/or 
UC use than unexposed adolescents.
METHODS
Participants and Procedures
A secondary analysis of wave 2 data 
(October 3, 2014–October 30, 2015) 
from the Population Assessment 
of Tobacco and Health (PATH) 
Study, a longitudinal cohort study 
in which researchers measure 
tobacco use behavior and related 
health outcomes in US adolescents 
and adults, 
21 was conducted. A total 
of 7389 nonsmoking adolescents 
were included after excluding those 
who reported that they had asthma 
diagnoses (n = 2198) and were 
current smokers (n = 143). PATH 
Study procedures are described 
elsewhere.21 A university-based 
institutional review board considered 
the study to be not human subjects 
research, and exempt from review.
Measures
TSE Variables
We used 3 exposure variables that 
included adolescent self-report of 
the following: (1) lives with a smoker 
who may not smoke inside the home 
and whether anyone who lives in 
the home now smokes cigarettes, 
cigars, cigarillos, or filtered cigars; 
(2) home TSE and whether smoking 
tobacco products that are burned are 
allowed inside the home by anyone 
who lives in the home, including 
visitors or workers; and (3) having 
≥1 hour of TSE (how many hours 
they were around others who were 
smoking in the past 7 days, including 
time at home, in a car, at school, or 
outdoors).
TSE-Related Symptom Outcome 
Variables
TSE-related symptoms included 
adolescent self-report of the 
following: shortness of breath 
compared with peers, finding it 
harder to exercise compared with 
peers, chest sounding wheezy 
during or after exercise in the past 
12 months, wheezing or whistling 
in the chest in the past 12 months, 
wheezing that disturbed sleep in 
the past 12 months, speech that is 
limited to only 1 to 2 words between 
breaths because of wheezing in the 
past 12 months, and dry cough at 
night that is not associated with a 
cold or chest infection in the past 12 
months. Wheezing-related questions 
were only asked among adolescents 
who reported having experienced 
wheezing or whistling within their 
lifetime (n = 942). We assessed 
self-reported health indicators, for 
which responses were collapsed 
into 2 categories because of skewed 
distributions: overall health, physical 
health (poor, fair, or good versus very 
good or excellent), and frequency 
of missing school because of illness 
(never or rarely versus sometimes, 
often, or very often).
ED and/or UC Use Outcome Variables
For ED and/or UC use, we used 
parent report variables because 
adolescent report was not publicly 
available. The variables included the 
following: (1) visited an ED and/or 
UC for a health problem in the past 
12 months and (2) the number of ED

Downloaded from 
 and/or UC visits for a health problem 
in the past 12 months.
Covariates
We selected the following covariates 
a priori: adolescent sex (male or 
female), age (12–14 years or 15–17 
years), race (white, African American, 
or other), ethnicity (non-Hispanic or 
Hispanic), and parent education level 
(less than high school, high school or 
equivalent, some college, bachelor’s 
degree, or advanced degree). 
Adolescent age was dichotomized in 
the PATH Study for public use.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were performed by using 
R version 3.3.0.22 We used sampling 
weights provided in the PATH 
Study to compensate for sampling 
design factors (eg, oversampling), 
nonresponse adjustment factors, 
differential nonresponse rates, 
possible sampling frame deficiencies, 
and variable selection probabilities. 
We performed χ2 tests to examine 
the relationship between TSE 
measures and covariates. We report 
raw sample sizes and weighted 
percentages to provide estimates 
that are generalizable to the US 
nonsmoking adolescent population 
without asthma diagnoses. We 
built a series of logistic regression 
models, adjusting for the covariates, 
to examine the association between 
TSE and TSE-related symptoms, 
other health indicators, and ED and/
or UC use. We report adjusted odds 
ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs). We built multiple 
Poisson regression models to 
assess the relationship between 
TSE and the number of ED and/or 
UC visits while controlling for the 
covariates. We present weighted 
least squares means, weighted SEs, 
and β coefficients. A sensitivity 
analysis was performed to assess 
whether removing adolescents who 
may not have been diagnosed and 
treated for asthma and/or reported 
asthma symptoms of wheezing or 
whistling in the chest during the 
past 12 months (n = 312) from 
analysis skewed the study’s results. 
Trends remained similar despite the 
smaller sample size and lower power. 
Analyses were 2 sided, with P < .05 
indicating significance. Incomplete 
cases were excluded before each 
analysis.
RESULTS
Of the 7389 nonsmoking adolescents 
included after excluding those with 
asthma diagnoses (n = 2198) and 
current smokers (n = 143), 49.7% 
(n = 3651) were boys and 42.4% 
(n = 3181) were 12 to 14 years old. 
A total of 77.2% (n = 5078) were 
non-Hispanic, 71.1% (n = 4832) 
were white, 15.0% (n = 1054) 
were African American, and 13.9% 
(n = 1053) were of another race. 
Parent education level varied, with 
12.4% obtaining less than a high 
school diploma (n = 1033), 21.7% 
completing high school or equivalent 
(n = 1595), 30.5% obtaining some 
college (n = 2098), 22.4% completing 
a bachelor’s degree (n = 1389), and 
13.0% completing an advanced 
degree (n = 755). A total of 24.7%  
(n = 1868) of adolescents lived with a 
smoker, 17.7% (n = 1338) had home 
TSE, and 35.3% (n = 2554) had ≥1 
hour of TSE.
Sociodemographic Characteristics 
of Adolescents by TSE
Boys and girls had similar rates of 
living with a smoker (24.4% and 
24.9%, respectively) and home TSE 
(17.7% and 17.7%, respectively). 
There was a significant difference 
between boys (31.9%) and girls 
(37.7%) for TSE ≥1 hour (P < .001; 
 
Table 1). Adolescent age differed  
by living with a smoker (P = .003) 
and TSE ≥1 hour (P < .001), with 
higher rates reported among 15- to 
17-year-olds (26.2% and 37.3%, 
respectively) compared with 12- to 
14-year-olds (23.1% and 33.2%, 
respectively). Race differed on the 
basis of living with a smoker (P < .001)  
and home TSE (P < .001), with the 
highest rates reported among African 
American adolescents (30.2% and 
24.0%, respectively), followed 
by white adolescents (24.5% and 
17.3%, respectively) and adolescents 
of other races (23.2% and 14.9%, 
respectively). Ethnicity differed on 
the basis of TSE (all P < .001), with 
non-Hispanic adolescents reporting 
higher rates of living with a smoker, 
home TSE, and TSE ≥1 hour (25.9%, 
18.5%, and 36.9%, respectively) 
compared with Hispanic adolescents 
(20.5%, 14.7%, and 29.5%, 
respectively). Parent education level 
differed on the basis of TSE (all  
P < .001; Table 1). Participants with 
parents who completed high school 
or an equivalent had the highest 
rates of living with a smoker (35.9%), 
home TSE (26.3%), and TSE ≥1 hour 
(44.4%).
TSE and TSE-Related Symptoms and 
Other Health Indicators
Adolescents who lived with a smoker, 
had home TSE, and had ≥1 hour 
of TSE were at increased risk of 
reporting shortness of breath, finding 
it harder to exercise compared with 
peers, wheezing during or after 
exercise, and dry cough at night 
than were unexposed participants 
(all P < .001; Table 2). Adolescents 
who lived with a smoker (P < .001) 
and had home TSE (P = .02) were at 
increased odds of reporting wheezing 
or whistling in the chest, and only 
adolescents with home TSE (P = .02) 
were at increased risk of reporting 
wheezing that disturbed sleep. 
Regarding other health indicators, 
adolescents who lived with a smoker, 
had home TSE, and had ≥1 hour of 
TSE were less likely to report very 
good or excellent overall health and 
physical health status (all P < .001; 
 
Table 2). Participants who lived with 
a smoker, had home TSE, and had 
≥1 hour of TSE were ∼1.50 times 
more likely to report they sometimes, 
often, or very often missed school 
because of illness (all P < .001).

 TSE and ED and/or UC Use
Participants who lived with a smoker 
and had ≥1 hour of TSE were 
significantly more likely to have  
had an ED and/or UC visit (both  
P < .001; Tables 3 and 4). Participants 
who lived with a smoker, had 
home TSE, and had ≥1 hour of TSE 
were at increased risk of having a 
higher number of ED and/or UC 
visits compared with unexposed 
participants. Specifically, participants 
with TSE had a mean of 1.62 to 1.65 
visits compared with unexposed 
participants, who had a mean of 1.42 
to 1.48 visits (Tables 3 and 4).
DISCUSSION
We found that more than one-
third (35.3%) of the nonsmoking 
adolescent population without 
asthma diagnoses nationwide were 
around others who smoked for 
≥1 hour in the past 7 days. Homa 
et al2 found similar rates (33.8%) 
of biochemically validated TSE, as 
measured by serum cotinine with a 
mean half-life of ∼16 hours, 
23 thus 
reflecting relatively short-term TSE. 
We found that one-quarter (24.7%) 
of adolescents lived with a smoker, 
and 17.7% lived in homes in which 
smoking is allowed inside the home 
by anyone. Similarly, Merianos et al14  
found that one-quarter (24.1%) of 
parents nationwide reported that 
their children (aged 0–17 years) 
lived with a smoker, but only 5% 
had home TSE. Thus, we report 
exceptionally high rates of self-
reported home TSE in adolescents 
without asthma diagnoses. One 
potential reason for the difference is 
that parents may underestimate their 
smoking prevalence, 
24, 
25 but we used 
adolescent report of home TSE. It 
should be noted that adolescents who 
live with smokers who do not smoke 
inside the home are still potentially 
exposed to tobacco smoke and its 
related toxicants.26 Despite an overall 
recent decline in TSE, 
2 we highlight 
the need for continued TSE reduction 
initiatives, especially for adolescents, 
nationwide.
We report demographic differences 
based on TSE. Girls had higher rates 
of TSE ≥1 hour. No sex differences 
were reported based on living with a 
smoker or home TSE, which differed 
from previous research that revealed 
that boys had slightly higher rates of 
living with a smoker and home TSE.14 
We found that older adolescents 
had relatively higher rates of living 
with a smoker and TSE ≥1 hour. 
Non-Hispanic adolescents had high 
rates of all TSE types, and African 
American adolescents had high rates 
of living with a smoker and home 
TSE, which is comparable to previous 
work.2 African American and white 
adolescents had similar rates of  
TSE ≥1 hour. Parent education level 
varied; the lower the grade level, 
with the exception of less than a high 
school diploma, the higher the TSE 
prevalence, which parallels existing 
literature.2, 
 
27
One of our objectives was to examine 
the association between TSE and 
potentially related symptoms and 
other health indicators. As posited, 
we found that adolescents without 
asthma diagnoses who had any TSE 
were at increased odds of having 
TSE-related symptoms, including 
shortness of breath and dry cough at 
night. Adolescents who lived with a 
smoker had higher risk of reporting 
wheezing or whistling in the chest, 
and adolescents with home TSE 
had increased risk of wheezing or 
whistling in the chest and wheezing 
that disturbed sleep. Wheeze-related 
symptoms are frequently reported 
as TSE-attributable symptoms.5

 One potential explanation for the 
variations in symptoms by TSE 
measures is that those who live with 
a smoker and have home TSE are 
regularly exposed compared with 
those who may have temporary TSE 
for ≥1 hour in the past 7 days. For 
example, adolescents who live with 
someone who smokes tobacco inside 
the home may experience exposure at 
night, thus leading to wheezing that 
disturbed sleep. Future researchers 
should capture the frequency and 
amount of TSE and use biochemically 
validated measures to provide better 
insight into the differences found in 
this study.
TSE negatively impacts adolescents’ 
overall health and physical health.1, 
 
10  
We found that TSE translated 
into a lower likelihood of having 
very good or excellent overall 
health and physical health status, 
as hypothesized. We found that 
regardless of TSE measure, 
adolescents with TSE reported  
that it was harder to exercise 
compared with peers and wheezing 
during or after exercise. Previous 
work reveals that TSE negatively 
impacts exercise capacity in adults, 
28  
which was reported in our study. 
TSE may cause overall decreased 
maximum oxygen uptake because 
TSE reduces oxygen delivery to the 
myocardium and potentially reduces 
the myocardium’s ability to use the 
delivered oxygen effectively.5 This 
physiologic response caused by 
TSE inhibits exercise. Additionally, 
participants who lived with a smoker, 
had home TSE, and were around 
TSE for ≥1 hour were at increased 
risk of frequently missing school 
because of being sick. This expanded 
on previous findings that living with 
a smoker contributed to increased 
school absenteeism.8 TSE contributes 
to increased morbidity and related 
consequences in adolescents without 
asthma diagnoses.
Another study objective was to 
examine the relationship between 
TSE and ED and/or UC use among 
adolescents who are often high users 
of these settings. The literature 
reveals mixed findings among youth; 
thus, this study was conducted to 
further assess these relationships 
by using 3 distinct TSE measures. 
As hypothesized, we found that 
adolescents who were exposed by 
living with a smoker or had ≥1 hour 
of TSE were at an elevated risk of 
ED and/or UC use compared with 
adolescents who did not live with 
a smoker or had no TSE in the past 
7 days. These findings align with 
previous work by Merianos et al, 
14 
which found that children who lived 
with a smoker were at an increased 
risk, and children with TSE levels (as 
measured by serum cotinine) that 
were indicative of active smoking (≥3 
ng/mL) were 3.5 times more likely 
to select an ED as the place they most 
often go for health care.13
Interestingly, we found that all TSE 
types increased the risk of having 
a higher number of ED and/or 
UC visits. These venues should be 
considered high-priority settings  
for TSE prevention intervention 
because of the increased interaction 
with adolescents who are exposed. 
EDs are typically the main sources  
for primary care and preventable

 health care services for Americans 
who have limited access to primary 
health care settings.29 Previous 
TSE reduction initiatives reveal 
that health care providers and 
parents who smoke and bring their 
children to ED and/or UC settings 
are highly receptive to these feasible 
efforts.30, 
 
31 In addition, delivering 
interventions in these settings may 
increase caregiver quit attempts 
and successful quits and ultimately 
decrease child TSE.32– 
34 This includes 
the implementation of electronic 
health record–embedded clinical 
decision support systems that can 
be easily incorporated into busy ED 
and/or UC providers’ workloads.34, 
 
35  
However, despite these practical 
options, prevention initiatives in 
these settings, including the first step 
of TSE screening, are infrequent.36– 
38 
Efforts supported by evidence-based 
policies and procedures, including 
the implementation of systems to 
prevent, identify, and treat tobacco 
dependence, may help to increase 
ED and/or UC professionals’ 
engagement with adolescents and 
their families about eliminating TSE 
to protect their overall health.39, 
 
40
Study strengths include examining 
the relationship between several 
TSE measures and ED and/or 
UC use by using a sample that is 
generalizable to the US nonsmoking 
adolescent population without 
asthma diagnoses and controlling 
for sociodemographics that may 
influence this relationship. Despite 
the study strengths, the limitations 
should be noted. We were limited to 
public-use variables provided in the 
PATH Study, including relying  
on adolescent report of TSE, which 
may have been underreported, 
41, 
 
42 
rather than using biomarkers. We 
relied on parent report of ED and/or  
UC use because adolescent report 
was unavailable. Although authors of 
other studies have used population-
based survey data that rely on parent 
report of a child’s health care  
use, 
13, 
 
14 future researchers should 
examine the validity of parent report 
by comparing responses to medical 
records. Residual confounding 
may have biased results, although 
we adjusted for well-known 
confounders. We adjusted for 
parent education level as a proxy 
for socioeconomic status because 
the PATH Study does not provide 
publicly available information on 
income level or health insurance. 
Although it is possible that some 
adolescents who were not diagnosed 
yet were included, the proportion 
of adolescents with asthma who 
were excluded (23%) was higher 
than in other national data, which 
indicate that ∼18% have had lifetime 
asthma.43 Finally, inferences are 
not causal or temporal because we 
analyzed 1 wave of data. Because the 
PATH Study continues to collect data, 
it would be of interest to examine the 
longitudinal relationship between 
TSE and related symptoms and ED 
and/or UC use among nonsmoking 
adolescents.
CONCLUSIONS
With this study, we add to the 
literature by examining the 
potential impact TSE has on TSE-
related symptoms and ED and/or 
UC use among solely nonsmoking 
adolescents without asthma 
diagnoses and revealing that a 
considerable proportion are exposed 
by living with a smoker, at home, and 
for ≥1 hour. We found that different 
TSE types uniquely increased the 
risk of TSE-related symptoms, other 
health indicators, and ED and/
or UC use. However, all TSE types 
increased the risk of having a higher 
number of visits to an ED and/or 
UC, and this has not been previously 
reported. Because adolescents are 
high users of EDs and/or UCs for 
primary care reasons, these venues 
are high-volume settings that should 
be used to offer interventions to 
adolescents with TSE and their 
families. They should be educated on 
the importance of TSE elimination 
to increase their overall health and 
wellness, especially because they 
may not be receiving preventive 
care elsewhere. There are feasible 
options available for EDs and UCs to 
implement such efforts that would 
not interfere with clinical flow. 
Targeting initiatives to adolescents 
with potential TSE-related symptoms 
and illnesses may assist in reducing 
TSE and related morbidity. Sustained 
TSE reduction research is needed 
to better understand TSE-related 
symptoms and ED and/or UC use. 
Physicians at EDs and UCs should 
consider referring adolescents 
with asthma symptoms (eg, 
recurrent wheeze, shortness of 
breath, or difficulty exercising) for 
a formal evaluation to ensure that 
undiagnosed cases are properly 
treated. Longitudinal research with 
objective measures would provide 
better insight into the influence that 
TSE has on related symptoms, overall 
health, and ED and/or UC use over 
time.
