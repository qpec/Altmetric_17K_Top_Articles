Introduction
Supportive and palliative care play an important role in can-
cer treatment, and when introduced early can improve qual-
ity of life (QoL)–related outcomes and may even increase 
median survival rates, as shown in patients with advanced 
lung cancer.1 Complementary medicine (CM) is extremely 
popular among oncology patients, with as many as half of 
US patients reported using at least 1 CM therapy within the 
previous year, and as many as 91% doing so during chemo-
therapy and radiation treatments.2-4 In order to further 
advance patient care, many of today’s oncology centers 
have established integrative oncology services, which pro-
vide patients with evidence-based CM treatments shown to 
be both effective and safe in reducing the symptom load and 
improving QoL-related outcomes.5,6 In these programs, 
patients undergo a consultation with an integrative physi-
cian (IP) who has extensive training and experience in the 
field of integrative oncology. The IP provides both guidance 
on nutrition and the use of supplements, referring patients 
to a wide range of CM treatment modalities from varying

Abstract
Background: Homeopathy has the potential to reduce symptoms related to cancer treatment. The present study examined 
the feasibility of a homeopathic consultation and treatment program, provided as part of an integrative oncology service. 
Methods: The electronic medical files of patients undergoing a homeopathic consultation in an integrative oncology 
service clinic were examined retrospectively. Adherence to the homeopathic treatment regimen and perceived response 
to the treatment were evaluated. Results: The files of 124 patient (34 males, 90 females) were examined, of which 
two-thirds reported acquiring and self-administering the homeopathic remedy as prescribed, and nearly three-quarters 
reporting a beneficial effect. Adherence to the homeopathic treatment regimen was greatest among patients attending 
a second visit, as opposed to having only telephone/e-mail follow-up (P < .005). An association was found between a 
perceived beneficial effect of treatment with attending a follow-up visit (P = .04), female gender (P = .02), younger age (P = 
.048), diagnosis of breast cancer (P = .014), and current radiation treatment (vs chemotherapy; P = .003). Patients reporting 
chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy were also more likely to report a beneficial effect (P = .004), as were female 
patients reporting hot flashes (P = .005) and those referred by an oncologist (P = .046). No adverse effects were attributed 
to the homeopathic treatment. Conclusions: Homeopathy can be successfully incorporated within a supportive care 
integrative oncology service. In addition to demographic and cancer-related characteristics, as well as symptoms, patients 
attending a second visit (vs only telephone/e-mail follow-up) were more likely to adhere to and perceive a beneficial effect 
from the homeopathic regimen.

etc).
Homeopathy is an extremely popular CM modality, 
especially in Europe and the Far East (India). Homeopathy 
teaches that highly diluted and succussed natural substances 
(organic and inorganic) can restore the body’s “vital force,” 
relieving symptoms and restoring health,7 in accordance 
with the “law of similars” as described by Samuel 
Hahnemann.8 Homeopathy uses both “low potency” (ie, 
<12C, or a dilution <10−24) and “high potency” (ie, >12C, or 
a dilution ≥10−24), with the former used for acute and physi-
cal symptoms, the latter for chronic and psychological 
symptoms.9 However, because homeopathy uses highly 
diluted compounds, as well as its homeopathic approach to 
patient care (vs the allopathic paradigm of conventional 
medicine), this complementary medicine therapy remains 
one of the most debated modalities in integrative oncology.
Still, despite the controversy, a large body of research 
has been published in the scientific literature supporting the 
benefits of homeopathy on health and well-being, including 
in cancer care. Clinical studies have shown homeopathy to 
potentially reduce many of the toxic effects of oncology 
treatments, while improving global health and well-being.10 
These include cancer-related fatigue,11 hot flashes due to 
hormonal treatment in patients with breast cancer,12-16 and 
radiation-induced dermatitis.17,18 A 2009 Cochrane review 
on the benefits of homeopathy identified 8 clinical trials 
that were of adequate quality (n = 664), and though the 
review did not find any clear evidence for the effectiveness 
of homeopathy for treatment-related outcomes (ie, sur-
vival), it did suggest a beneficial impact in reducing radia-
tion-induced 
dermatitis 
and 
chemotherapy-induced 
stomatitis. The authors of this systematic review also con-
cluded that homeopathy is safe and without adverse effects, 
either direct (ie, toxic effects) or indirect (ie, interactions 
with conventional anticancer agents).19
The present study set out to examine the feasibility of a 
homeopathic consultation and treatment regimen, provided 
as part of an integrative medicine service located within an 
oncology institute in central Israel. The characteristics of 
the patients referred to the consultation, as well as their 
adherence and perceived response to the homeopathic treat-
ment regimen, were examined as well. The feasibility of 
incorporating homeopathy into integrative oncology care, 
alone or in conjunction with other CM modalities, is 
discussed.
Material and Methods
Study Setting
The study took place at the Tal Center for Integrative 
Oncology at the Institute of Oncology, Sheba Medical 
Center, Israel. The Institute of Oncology at Sheba provides 
state-of-the art medical and radiation oncology therapies, 
and houses the Institute of Hemato-Oncology. The Tal 
Center provides integrative medicine treatments to patients 
with cancer during active treatment, as well as during survi-
vorship and end-of-life care. Treatments are provided both 
on an individual basis (eg, acupuncture, reflexology, 
Shiatsu, homeopathy, macrobiotic nutritional guidance, etc) 
and in groups (yoga, Chi Kong, meditation, etc). The study 
was approved by the Research Ethics Board at the Sheba 
Medical Center.
Homeopathic Consultation
All patients treated with homeopathy at the study center are 
referred by either an IP or by their oncologist. At the first 
visit, the homeopath examines the patient’s medical history 
and addresses their expectations from both the integrative 
oncology service in general and the homeopathic therapeu-
tic process in particular. The homeopath then conducts an 
in-depth examination of the patient’s “story”, in which the 
various “stations” of their “journey”, from the initial diag-
nosis to the surgical, medical and radiation treatments are 
addressed. The patient’s concerns regarding general and 
specific QoL-related concerns are addressed, and together 
with the homeopath external and internal factors which 
may relieve or worsen their symptoms (eg, heat/cold, time 
of day, etc) are identified. The homeopath also evaluates 
the patient’s mental and emotional state, dietary prefer-
ences (eg, sweet vs salty), as well as other lifestyle-related 
factors.
At the end of the first homeopathic consultation patients 
are given a prescription for a remedy, to be prepared and 
dispensed by a Ministry of Health–certified pharmacy. A 
follow-up visit is scheduled in a month’s time, when the 
symptoms described and new ones that may have appeared 
in the interim are addressed. At the follow-up visit patients 
are asked about their adherence to the suggested treatment 
regimen (ie, acquiring and self-administering the remedy). 
During the treatment process patients are contacted by the 
homeopath, either by phone or via e-mail. All follow-up 
visits—whether by phone/e-mail or in person—are recorded 
in the patient’s electronic medical file.
Data Retrieval
Patient files were retrospectively examined for demographic 
information (gender, age, country of birth); cancer-related 
parameters, which include the site of primary tumor, tumor 
stage (localized/metastatic), treatment modality (chemother-
apy/radiotherapy/other), and therapeutic setting (neoadju-
vant/adjuvant/curative/palliative).The 
files 
were 
also 
searched for patient-reported symptoms, which included 
fatigue and/or weakness, upper gastrointestinal (GI) symp-
toms (nausea/vomiting/retching, anorexia, disturbed taste); 
 488 
Integrative Cancer Therapies 17(2)
lower GI symptoms (constipation/diarrhea); pain (localized/
diffuse; joint/muscle); symptoms associated with peripheral 
neuropathy (sensory/motor); emotional concerns (depres-
sion, anxiety, other); sleep disturbances; and other disease- 
or treatment-related concerns. In addition to the above 
information, each patient file was examined for the referring 
healthcare professional, adherence to the homeopathic treat-
ment regimen, and self-perceived effect of the homeopathic 
therapeutic process.
Statistics
The collected data were examined using SPSS software pro-
gram (version 20; IBM, Armonk, NY). Pearson’s chi-square 
and Fisher’s exact tests were used to identify variations in 
demographic data and the prevalence of categorical vari-
ables in the 2 groups of patients (adherent vs nonadherent; 
effect on symptoms—improved, worsened, no effect). A t 
test was used to evaluate differences between continuous 
variables when normality was assumed. A Mann-Whitney U 
test was used for cases of nonnormal distribution. Paired 
tests were used in order to evaluate the mean differences 
between groups; the Mann-Whitney U test evaluated the dif-
ference between the median values. A P value of ≤.05 was 
considered to be of statistical significance.
Results
The study sample consisted of 124 patients (34 males, 90 
females) who had been referred to the homeopathic consul-
tation and for whom data were available. The demographic 
and cancer-related characteristics, as well as the main 
symptoms reported by participants, are presented in Table 
1. The mean age of the study group was 57.0 ± 13.3 years, 
with no significant difference between genders. Nearly half 
of participants were diagnosed with breast cancer, and more 
than three-quarters with localized (vs metastatic) disease. 
Half of the patients were undergoing active cancer treat-
ment at the time of the consultation, which included chemo-
therapy, radiotherapy, and treatment with biological or 
endocrine agents. More than two-thirds reported suffering 
from fatigue and/or weakness, with just less than half

reporting symptoms from the upper or lower GI tracts, as 
well as those associated with peripheral neuropathy, hot 
flashes, disturbed sleep, and emotional concerns.
More than two-thirds of patients had been referred to the 
homeopathic consultation by an IP, the remainder by an 
oncologist. Less than half of the patients (43%) attended a 
second visit with the study homeopath, in addition to tele-
phone or e-mail follow up. Forty percent of the patients 
were currently being treated with other complementary 
medicine modalities (acupuncture, reflexology, etc).
Following the first homeopathic consultation, patients 
were given a prescription for a homeopathic remedy, to be 
acquired at one of the pharmacies licensed by the Israeli 
Ministry of Health to prepare and dispense homeopathic 
preparations. The most frequently prescribed remedies were 
Carcinosin (30C), Phosphoricum acidum (30C), Cadmium 
sulphuratum (30 C), X-ray (6C), and Radium bromatum 
(30C). Of the total cohort of 124 patients, 82 (66.2%) pro-
cured and self-administered the remedy as prescribed. 
Adherence to the homeopathic treatment regimen was simi-
lar in both genders, and was not found to be related to the 
age of the patient, primary tumor site, symptoms reported 
by the patient, or use of other complementary medicine 
modalities during the study period. A chi-square analysis 
found a higher rate of adherence among patients undergoing 
chemotherapy (P = .047), though this group was extremely 
small and further analysis did not support the finding. 
Patients who had been referred by their oncologist (vs an 
IP) tended to be more adherent to the treatment regimen, 
though this finding was also not of statistical significance 
(P = .09). However, patients who attended a second visit 
with the homeopath were significantly more likely to adhere 
to the treatment regimen than those whose follow-up was 
only by telephone/e-mail (P < .005).
Of the 82 patients who adhered to the homeopathic treat-
ment regimen (ie, acquired and self-administered the rem-
edy as prescribed), nearly three-quarters (73.2%, n = 60) 
reported that they felt that the treatment was of benefit 
(Table 2). The remaining patients felt that the treatment was

either of no benefit, or did not know whether there was 
indeed an effect. Only 1 patient reported a worsening of 
symptoms (irritability), though this was not attributed to the 
homeopathic treatment. Factors that were associated with a 
perceived beneficial effect included attending a second visit 
with the homeopath (vs telephone/e-mail follow-up alone; 
P = .04), female gender (P = .02), younger age (P = .048), 
diagnosis of breast cancer (P = .014), and currently under-
going radiation treatment (vs chemotherapy; P = .003). 
Patients reporting chemotherapy-induced peripheral neu-
ropathy were also more likely to report that the homeo-
pathic therapy was of benefit (P = .004), as well as female 
patients reporting hot flashes (P = .05). Finally, female 
patients who had been referred to the study homeopath by 
their oncologist were also more likely to report a beneficial 
effect of the treatment (P < .005).
Discussion
The present study set out to examine the feasibility of a 
homeopathic consultation and treatment regimen, provided 
as part of an integrative oncology service located within an 
oncology institute. We found that the homeopathic thera-
peutic process was feasible, with two-thirds of patients 
acquiring and self-administering the remedies as prescribed. 
Adherence was significantly higher among patients who 
attended a second visit with the homeopath, as opposed to 
telephone or e-mail follow-up alone. In addition, a trend for 
greater adherence was found among patients who had been 
referred by their oncologist (vs an IP), though this finding 
was of borderline significance. No difference in adherence 
was found between those who were treated with homeopa-
thy alone and those receiving other modalities of comple-
mentary medicine.
Nearly three-quarters (73%) of patients who adhered to 
the homeopathic treatment regimen reported that the treat-
ment was helpful in reducing their symptoms. This positive 
response was more pronounced among female patients, 
especially those of a younger age, patients with a diagnosis 
of breast cancer, and those undergoing radiotherapy. 
Patients reporting symptoms associated with peripheral 
neuropathy and female patients with hot flashes were also 
more likely to report a beneficial effect. A perceived benefi-
cial effect from homeopathy was found to be more likely 
among female patients who had been referred by their 
oncologist, as well as those who attended a second visit 
with the homeopath, as opposed to telephone or e-mail fol-
low-up alone. As with earlier research, no adverse effects 
were associated with the homeopathic treatment in the pres-
ent study. Research has also shown that homeopathy does 
not impair treatment outcomes in patients with advanced 
cancer, and may even have a positive effect on survival 
rates, though this remains to be proven in large controlled 
trials.20
The demographic and cancer-related characteristics 
associated with adherence to the homeopathic treatment 
regimen are similar to those found in other studies examin-
ing the use of complementary medicine by patients with 
cancer. Patients using these therapies are more likely to be 
female, and with a diagnosis of breast cancer. The lowest 
rates of complementary medicine use found in male patients 
with prostate cancer.21,22 However, the rates of use of home-
opathy by adult patients with cancer, alone or in conjunc-
tion with other complementary medicine modalities, has 
been largely uninvestigated. In contrast, a number of studies 
have examined the use of homeopathy in pediatric oncol-
ogy, where rates of use range from 1.2% in Canada to 45.2% 
in Germany.23,24 A Canadian study published in this journal 
investigated the feasibility of a homeopathic treatment pro-
gram in children with chemotherapy-related fatigue. The 
researchers concluded that the use of homeopathy in this 
setting was not feasible, primarily due to a lack of interest 
on behalf of parents, despite the fact that they found the 
treatment to be easy or very easy to follow.25
There are a number of challenges faced when including 
homeopathy in the integrative oncology setting. Conventional 
oncology health care professionals may find it easier to 
accept the allopathic approach of therapies such as acupunc-
ture and herbal medicine. Indeed, there are many conven-
tional chemotherapy agents which originate from plant 
sources,26 and many of the physiological effects of acupunc-
ture, such as the release of β-endorphins and adrenocortico-
tropic hormone (ACTH), have been well documented.27 In 
contrast, although there is clinical evidence supporting the 
effects of homeopathy on reducing many of the symptoms 
associated with cancer care, the use of highly diluted com-
pounds (with further dilution to increase the “strength” of the 
effect) make it extremely difficult for conventional medicine 
to accept. In order for homeopathy to become part of conven-
tional supportive cancer care, there is a need for randomized, 
controlled trials that will test the effectiveness of this modal-
ity in alleviating cancer and treatment-related toxicities.
The present study has a number of limitations which 
need to be addressed in future research on this subject. First 
and foremost is the retrospective nature of the study, as well 
as the generality of the question regarding patients’ response 
to the homeopathic treatment. The use of patient-report out-
come measures, for example, would have provided a more 
accurate and measurable assessment of patients’ response to 
the homeopathy. In addition, the integration of CM in con-
ventional supportive cancer care has been shown to be 
related to the cross-cultural aspects of care, which need to 
be addressed in any therapeutic framework, especially inte-
grative oncology.28 The present study population was com-
prised almost exclusively of Hebrew-speaking patients 
residing in central Israel, and may thus not reflect popula-
tions from more peripheral areas of the country, where the 
socioeconomic status is typically lower.

Conclusions
Homeopathy can be successfully incorporated into an inte-
grative oncology service, on its own or as an adjuvant to 
other complementary medicine modalities. Adherence to 
the homeopathic treatment regimen can be increased by 
asking the patient to attend a second visit with the homeo-
path, as opposed to telephone or e-mail follow-up alone. 
Demographic (female gender, younger age), cancer-related 
factors (breast cancer, radiotherapy) and symptom-related 
factors (peripheral neuropathy, hot flashes) are associated 
with a perceived beneficial response to the homeopathic 
therapeutic process, as is a referral to the homeopath by the 
patient’s oncologist. Further research is needed in order to 
better understand how to best introduce the homeopathic 
paradigm of care to the integrative oncology setting, along 
with other therapeutic modalities of complementary medi-
cine in supportive cancer care.
