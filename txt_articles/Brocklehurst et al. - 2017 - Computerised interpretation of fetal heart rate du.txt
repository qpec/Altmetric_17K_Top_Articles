Computerised interpretation of fetal heart rate during 
labour (INFANT): a randomised controlled trial
The INFANT Collaborative Group*
Summary
Background Continuous electronic fetal heart-rate monitoring is widely used during labour, and computerised 
interpretation could increase its usefulness. We aimed to establish whether the addition of decision-support software 
to assist in the interpretation of cardiotocographs affected the number of poor neonatal outcomes.
Methods In this unmasked randomised controlled trial, we recruited women in labour aged 16 years or older having 
continuous electronic fetal monitoring, with a singleton or twin pregnancy, and at 35 weeks’ gestation or more at 
24 maternity units in the UK and Ireland. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to decision support with the INFANT 
system or no decision support via a computer-generated stratified block randomisation schedule. The primary 
outcomes were poor neonatal outcome (intrapartum stillbirth or early neonatal death excluding lethal congenital 
anomalies, or neonatal encephalopathy, admission to the neonatal unit within 24 h for ≥48 h with evidence of 
feeding difficulties, respiratory illness, or encephalopathy with evidence of compromise at birth), and developmental 
assessment at age 2 years in a subset of surviving children. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is 
completed and is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, number 98680152.
Findings Between Jan 6, 2010, and Aug 31, 2013, 47 062 women were randomly assigned (23 515 in the decision-
support group and 23 547 in the no-decision-support group) and 46 042 were analysed (22 987 in the decision-support 
group and 23 055 in the no-decision-support group). We noted no difference in the incidence of poor neonatal 
outcome between the groups—172 (0·7%) babies in the decision-support group compared with 171 (0·7%) babies in 
the no-decision-support group (adjusted risk ratio 1·01, 95% CI 0·82–1·25). At 2 years, no significant differences were 
noted in terms of developmental assessment. 
Interpretation Use of computerised interpretation of cardiotocographs in women who have continuous electronic 
fetal monitoring in labour does not improve clinical outcomes for mothers or babies.

Introduction
Continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring in 
labour is widely used but its potential for improving 
neonatal outcomes has not been realised.1 The reasons 
for this are complex, but include difficulty interpreting 
the fetal heart rate trace correctly during labour.2–4 
Computerised interpretation could be used to objectively 
detect abnormalities in fetal heart rate patterns during 
labour that are associated with asphyxia and bring them 
to the attention of birth attendants, who could then take 
action or expedite delivery and potentially prevent 
stillbirth or exposure to significant asphyxia. 
Guardian (K2 Medical Systems, Plymouth, UK) is an 
electronic information capture system for managing 
information from labour monitoring.5 It displays the 
cardiotocograph on a computer screen alongside other 
clinical data either from external ultrasonographic 
transducers, or from fetal scalp electrodes (eg, 
partographs, maternal vital signs, details of maternal 
anaesthesia and analgesia) collected as part of routine 
clinical care. Guardian does not interpret any of the data 
gathered, but acts as an interface to collect and display 
data at the bedside, centrally on the labour ward, in 
consultants’ offices, or remotely. 
INFANT (K2 Medical Systems) is a decision-support 
software that was developed to run on the Guardian 
system. It analyses the quality of fetal heart signals and, 
if these signals are adequate, displays baseline heart rate; 
heart-rate variability; accelerations and type and timing 
of decelerations; the quality of the signal; and the 
contraction 
pattern.6–8 
INFANT 
then 
makes 
an 
assessment of the overall pattern, which, if necessary, 
will result in a colour-coded alert (blue is the least severe, 
yellow is moderate severity, and red is the most severe; 
appendix). The decision-support software does not 
provide recommendations for any action that should be 
taken in response to abnormalities—such decisions are 
at the discretion of attending clinicians. In the UK’s 
National Health Service (NHS), all clinicians supervising 
labour are expected to have been trained in the 
appropriate response to an abnormal cardiotocographic 
reading—eg, by completing computer-based training 
packages every 6–12 months, attending annual lectures, 
or attending regular cardiotocographic review meetings.

However, training is not standardised, and individual 
competence is not assessed in most units.9
We did a randomised controlled trial to test the 
hypotheses that a substantial proportion of substandard 
care results from failure to correctly identify abnormal 
fetal heart rate patterns, that improved recognition of 
abnormality would reduce substandard care and poor 
outcomes, and that improved recognition of normality 
would decrease unnecessary intervention. 
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a pragmatic, unblinded, randomised controlled 
trial in maternity units in the UK and Ireland. All 24 sites 
in the UK and Ireland that used Guardian at the time of 
the trial took part. Doctors and midwives were able to 
recruit participants. Eligible women were judged to 
require continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring 
by the local clinical team on the basis of their existing 
practice, had a singleton or twin pregnancy, were at 
35 weeks’ gestation or further along, had no known gross 
fetal abnormality, including any known fetal heart 
arrhythmia such as heart block, aged 16 years or older, 
and able to give consent to participate as judged by the 
attending clinicians. Continuous electronic fetal heart 
rate monitoring during labour is not routine in the UK. 
Clinical guidance for the NHS recommends that women 
assessed as having a low risk of complications should be 
offered intermittent auscultation during labour.10
Pregnant women attending recruiting hospitals were 
provided with written information about the trial during 
pregnancy and in labour. For women who met the 
eligibility criteria, written informed consent was sought 
by means of a dated signature from the woman and from 
the person who obtained informed consent. Research 
ethics committee approval for the study was granted by 
the National Research Ethics Service—Northern and 
Yorkshire Research Ethics Committee (09/H0903/31). 
The study protocol has been published.11
Randomisation and masking
The Guardian system was used to confirm that all 
necessary eligibility criteria were met and then to randomly 
allocate women (1:1) to cardiotocography with or without 
decision support. The allocations were computer generated 
in Stata (version 10.1) by the trial statistician, who used 
stratified block randomisation, in which variable block 
sizes were used to balance between the two trial arms by 
whether the pregnancy was a singleton (block sizes 12, 14, 
16, 18, 20, 22, and 24, allocated in proportion to the 
elements of Pascal’s triangle—1:6:15:20:15:6:1) or twin 
(block sizes 2, 4, and 6, allocated in proportion to the 
elements of Pascal’s triangle 1:2:1), and within each 
participating centre. The trial was not blinded, which 
allowed indirect measurement of any changes in clinician 
behaviour, such as how much time the attending midwife 
spent with the woman on the basis of the knowledge that 
the decision-support system was active or not.
Procedures
Clinicians in participating centres were trained in the use 
of the decision-support software by staff from the trial 
office. A training team at each site was responsible for 
cascading training among the local clinicians. Women in 
the trial were managed according to standard procedures. 
No additional training was provided to clinical staff in 
how to respond to fetal heart rate abnormalities. 
Labour data and outcomes were stored contem-
poraneously on the Guardian system, which were then 
sent electronically to the trial office. Data were extracted 
from notes of babies admitted to the neonatal unit and 
for all neonatal deaths. All children surviving were 
Research in context
Evidence before the study
The National Institute for Health Research searched the Cochrane 
library, PubMed, NHS Evidence, and the DARE database for 
articles published in the 5 years before it commissioned this trial 
in 2006. No studies of electronic decision support in 
interpretation of cardiotocography were identified. One previous 
trial of decision support in labour has been done, in which direct 
measurement of the fetal electrocardiograph—which requires 
the application of a fetal scalp electrode—was used. That trial 
recruited 7730 women and showed no evidence of a difference 
between the groups on the primary outcome of metabolic 
acidosis as measured in cord blood.
Added value of this study
This trial, INFANT, was the first to assess the use of decision 
support in the interpretation of the cardiotocographs in women 
undergoing continuous electronic fetal heart-rate monitoring. 
The aim was to address the effect on substantive outcomes of 
neonatal mortality and morbidity. The size of the INFANT trial 
provides sufficient power to detect small differences in the main 
outcome of perinatal mortality and serious morbidity, and 
outcomes such as metabolic acidosis. No differences were noted. 
Additionally, it had very high power to assess whether use of this 
decision-support system had any effect on the risk of operative 
delivery, and again we noted no evidence of any difference.
Implications of all the available evidence
The quality of care in labour is a major concern for women, their 
families, and the health professionals providing care for them. 
Technologies to improve intrapartum monitoring that identify 
early signs of fetal hypoxia during labour are needed so that 
clinicians can intervene and attempt to prevent poor neonatal 
outcomes. Our results show that the method of decision 
support we tested does not achieve this aim.

flagged at the NHS Information Centre for those born in 
England and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Safe 
Haven for those born in Scotland, which meant that all 
deaths occurring after discharge in these countries could 
be identified. Ireland does not have a similar system for 
monitoring deaths, so Irish data had to be excluded from 
the denominator for these calculations. A sample of 
surviving children were followed up to age 2 years via a 
parent-completed questionnaire to assess the child’s 
health, development, and wellbeing (appendix). 
All babies with an adverse outcome potentially associated 
with intrapartum asphyxia (ie, the trial primary outcome 
plus cord artery pH <7·05 with base deficit 12 mmol/L or 
more) and all neonatal deaths and intrapartum stillbirths 
had their care in labour assessed by review of de-identified 
case notes by a panel comprising a senior obstetrician, 
neonatologist, and midwife, to see if care was suboptimal—
ie, if it was possible or probable that different management 
would have prevented the adverse outcome.9,12
Outcomes
The trial had two primary outcomes. The first was a binary 
(present or not present) composite of poor neonatal 
outcome, including deaths (intrapartum stillbirths plus 
neonatal deaths up to 28 days after birth, except for 
congenital anomalies deaths) and significant morbidity 
(moderate or severe neonatal encephalopathy, defined as 
the use of whole-body cooling or admission to the neonatal 
unit within 48 h of birth for 48 h or more with evidence of 
feeding difficulties or respiratory illness, with evidence of 
compromise at birth suggesting mild asphyxia or mild 
encephalopathy, or both). The second was a continuous 
outcome of developmental progress measured by the 
Parent Report of Children’s Abilities—Revised (PARCA-R) 
composite score13,14 at age 2 years for a subset of children. 
Infant secondary outcomes, all of which are binary 
unless specified, were intrapartum stillbirth (excluding 
deaths from congenital anomalies); neonatal deaths up to 
28 days after birth (excluding deaths from congenital 
anomalies); moderate or severe encephalopathy; admis-
sions to the neonatal unit within 48 h of birth 
for 48 h or more with evidence of feeding difficulties 
or respiratory illness (when there was evidence of 
compromise at birth suggesting mild asphyxia or mild 
encephalopathy, or both); admission to a higher level of 
care; an Apgar score of less than 4 at 5 min; distribution of 
cord blood gas data for cord artery pH; metabolic acidosis 
(cord artery pH <7·05 and base deficit of 12 mmol/L or 
more); resuscitation interventions (categorical); seizures; 
destination immediately after birth (categorical); length 
of hospital stay (continuous); health and development 
outcomes at 24 months (continuous); score on the 
non-verbal cognition scale (continuous), vocabulary sub-
scale (continuous), and sentence complexity sub-scale 
(continuous) of PARCA-R; deaths to 24 months; major 
disability and non-major disability at 2 years; and cerebral 
palsy. Maternal secondary outcomes were mode of delivery 
(categorical); operative intervention (caesarean section 
and instrumental delivery) for fetal indications, failure to 
progress, a combination of fetal indications and failure to 
progress, or any other reason; grade or urgency of 
caesarean section15 (categorical); episiotomy; any episode 
of fetal blood sampling; length of first stage, length of 
second stage, and total length of labour from trial entry 
(continuous); 
destination 
immediately 
after 
birth 
(categorical); and admission to a higher level of care. 
Because trial allocation was not blinded, it was 
important to measure any change in clinical care that 
could result from clinicians being aware of whether the 
decision-support system was in operation. We measured 
the total number of cardiotocographic abnormalities and 
the proportion of women with cardiotocographic 
abnormalities in each arm; the time taken between last 
red alert and delivery (for these first three outcomes, we 
retrospectively used the decision-support software after 
the trial was over to analyse the cardiotocographic trace, 
and used these data to determine when the alert would 
have occurred); the number of routine measurements 
recorded during labour, including the number of vaginal 
examinations, use of epidural analgesia, use of labour 
augmentation, and presence of meconium; and the 
number of thumb entries (similar to a signature in paper 
notes) per hour from time of trial entry to first yellow 
level of concern or until the cervix was fully dilated (as a 
proxy measure to assess presence of a health professional 
in the delivery room during the labour).
Statistical analysis
A sample size of 46 000 births was needed.11 We postulated 
an incidence of the primary outcome of three per 1000 births 
by summing the previous reported rates of intrapartum 
stillbirth, neonatal death, moderate and severe encephalo-
pathy, and mild encephalopathy (reliable data for significant 
asphyxial morbidity were not available and so could only be 
estimated).16–18 The effect size that could be detected with 
46 000 women (23 000 in each group), assuming a 5% level 
of significance and 90% power, was a 50% reduction in 
poor neonatal outcomes from three to 1·5 per 1000. In a 
study of preterm infants,14 the mean PARCA-R composite 
score at 2 years was 80 (SD 33) and the mean Mental 
Development 
Index 
(Bayley 
Scales 
of 
Infant 
Development II) was around half an SD below the mean of 
100. Assuming that a healthy group of term infants would 
have a PARCA-R composite score half an SD higher than 
this sample of preterm infants, we estimated a mean 2 year 
score of 96 (SD 33). A follow-up sample of size 7000 
(3500 per arm) had more than 90% power to detect a 
difference of 3 points in the PARCA-R component score 
with a two-sided 5% significance level. The incidence of 
severe metabolic acidosis (cord artery pH <7·05) is 
ten per 1000.19–22 A sample of 46 000 women enabled us to 
detect a 28% relative risk reduction in this incidence with 
more than 80% power, assuming a 5% level of significance, 
in babies in whom cord artery pH was measured.

During the early part of the trial, and with advice from 
the data-monitoring committee, the primary outcome 
definition was refined to ensure that it captured babies 
who were likely to have experienced hypoxia during 
labour. The original component of the primary outcome—
admission to neonatal unit within 48 h of birth for 48 h or 
more with evidence of feeding difficulties, respiratory 
illness, or encephalopathy—resulted in the inclusion of 
many babies with a range of disorders, many of which 
were unlikely to be related to hypoxia. Each case fulfilling 
this component of the primary outcome was reviewed by 
an independent panel of neonatologists (who were blinded 
to allocation) to ascribe it as fulfilling the revised definition 
or not (appendix). 
The trial steering committee approved the statistical 
analysis plan before the analysis (appendix). For the main 
comparative analysis, participants were analysed in the 
groups into which they were randomly allocated, 
irrespective of allocation received. All women and babies 
with available data were included, except for women for 
whom a valid signed consent form could not be located or 
women who withdrew consent. The numbers and 
percentages of babies in whom the primary outcomes 
were noted are for each group, and the risk ratios plus 
95% CIs were calculated. Risk ratios were estimated with 
generalised linear models with a binomial distribution 
and a log link (or a Poisson distribution with a log link if 
convergence could not be achieved). Hazard ratios were 
estimated with Cox regression and rate ratios with 
Poisson regression. We adjusted for the stratification 
factors used in the randomisation (centre and singleton 
or twin pregnancy), and used robust variance estimators 
in all models to account for the correlation in outcomes 
between twins and siblings delivered in a subsequent

pregnancy during the trial period.11 The mean (SD) 
PARCA-R composite score was calculated for each group, 
and the mean difference between groups plus 95% CI 
were calculated and compared with a Gaussian model 
with identity link. For secondary outcomes including the 
components of the primary outcome, a 1% level of 
significance was employed. 
We did prespecified subgroup analyses with the statistical 
test for interaction for singletons versus twins, suspected 
fetal growth restriction at labour onset versus no growth 
restriction, body-mass index group, and centre. These 
analyses were done for the trial primary outcomes, all 
neonatal outcomes, instrumental vaginal deliveries, and 
caesarean section. Additionally, we did a subgroup analysis 
of all process outcomes by centre. Major disability at 2 years 
was classified in terms of neuromotor function, seizures, 
auditory function, communication, visual function, 
cognitive function, and other physical disability.23,24 
We used Stata/SE for Windows (version 13.1) for all 
analyses. The trial was overseen by an independent trial 
steering 
committee 
and 
an 
independent 
data-
monitoring committee. The data-monitoring committee 
used the Haybittle-Peto approach25 for interim analyses, 
with three SEs as the cutoff for consideration of early 
cessation, preserving the type-1 error across the trial.
The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 98680152.

(table 2). 172 (0·7%) of 23 263 babies had a poor outcome in 
the decision-support group compared with 171 (0·7%) of 
23 351 babies in the no-decision-support group (adjusted 
risk ratio [RR] 1·01, 95% CI 0·82–1·25; table 2). Similarly, we 
noted no evidence of a difference in any component of the 
composite primary outcome between the groups (table 2). 
A prespecified sensitivity analysis, in which we used a 
different cutoff for defining compromise at birth (a score of 
7 or greater indicating very severe compromise rather than 
a score of 3 or greater on a scale from 0 to 14), made no 
difference to the interpretation of the measure of effect for 
the primary outcome (adjusted RR 0·97, 95% CI 0·58–1·63; 
appendix). We noted no evidence of any differences in any 
of the trial’s secondary outcomes for the baby (table 2), 
including Apgar scores, admission to the neonatal unit, 
metabolic acidosis of cord blood samples, the need for 
neonatal resuscitation, or duration of hospital stay. 
Just over half of all births were spontaneous vaginal 
births and the frequency did not differ significantly 
between the two groups (adjusted RR 0·99, 99% CI 
0·97–1·01; table 2). More women underwent fetal blood 
sampling in the decision-support group than in the no-
decision-support group (2366 [10·3%] vs 2187 [9·5%]; 
adjusted RR 1·08, 99% CI 1·01–1·16). No other significant 
differences were noted between the two groups from trial 
entry to birth in terms of clinical outcomes (table 2).
For babies with an adverse outcome and cord metabolic 
acidosis who underwent expert review, the overall 
proportion of babies judged to have received suboptimal 
care likely to have affected the outcome was 38%—14 of 35 
babies in the decision-support group and 13 of 36 babies in 
the control group—which is similar to that reported 
previously.26 We could not investigate whether in all cases 
not reviewed appropriate action was taken in response to 
recognised abnormality.
In women with any level of concern as measured by 
INFANT (table 3), blue levels of concern were most 
frequent (median seven alerts during labour—roughly 
1·1 per h), followed by yellow alerts (median two alerts 
per labour), and then red alerts (median one per labour). 
A lower rate of yellow levels of concern was noted in the 
decision-support group compared with the no-decision-
support group (adjusted rate ratio 0·87, 99% CI 
0·84–0·89; table 3). Frequency of blue and red alerts did 
not differ significantly between groups (table 3).
Although there was a worry that women in the decision-
support group would be left alone more frequently during 
labour than those in the no-decision-support group, the 
frequency of thumbprint entries on the Guardian did not 
differ significantly between groups (4·22 per h vs 4·21; 
adjusted rate ratio 0·99, 99% CI 0·95–1·03; table 3).
Time from the last red level of concern to birth was 
similar in both groups (median 58 min; table 3). In a 
subgroup of 473 readable traces from a sample of 500 taken 
as a similar number of consecutive cases from each 
contributing centre, the last red level of concern was judged 
(by expert investigator, PS) to be a valid fetal concern for 
276 (58%) traces. Maternal heart rate triggered the red level 
of concern in 128 (27%) cases, misclassified accelerations 
in 36 (8%) cases, and other reasons in 33 (7%) cases.
Families were contacted when their surviving child or 
children born reached age 2 years. Nearly 7000 families 
returned a questionnaire. The characteristics of the 
mothers who responded differed significantly from those 
of the entire trial cohort and from those of mothers who 
did not respond (appendix). Compared with the entire

trial cohort, responders were more likely to be white, to 
have given birth at a later gestational age, and to have 
been having their first baby (appendix).
Of the 7066 infants for whom a questionnaire was 
returned, data could be analysed for 6707 (95%). We 
noted no significant differences between the two groups 
for any of the 2 year outcomes, including the primary 
outcome, PARCA-R score (table 4). Nearly 6% of children 
for whom data were available had a major disability. The 
classification of disability23,24 used meant that large 
numbers of children were assigned a major disability as 
a result of having poor growth (between 2·8% and 3·0% 
of all children) and cognitive difficulties (between 1·2% 
and 1·5% of all children). Other major disabilities such 
as physical disability, blindness, and deafness were all 
very uncommon (appendix).
We noted no evidence that the decision-support software 
performed significantly differently between any of the pre-
specified subgroups for either the primary outcome or a 
range of secondary outcomes (appendix). Furthermore, no 
differences were noted in the distribution of cord blood 
pH measurements (appendix). The number of alerts 
differed significantly by centre, but no other significant 
differences were noted by centre (appendix).
Discussion
In this trial of more than 46 000 women, we found 
no evidence that the use of decision-support software 
in conjunction with cardiotocography reduced the 
likelihood of poor neonatal outcomes compared with 
cardiotocography alone. 
In another randomised trial, which also recruited in the 
UK, the use of decision support was assessed in women 
monitored during labour with fetal electrocardiographic 
monitoring.27 This study also showed no evidence that 
decision support improved the primary outcome of cord 
blood metabolic acidosis in 7730 women.27 The results of 
one small trial28 of 220 women in Bulgaria have suggested 
that decision support is associated with benefits with 
respect to cord blood metabolic acidosis. In the UK 
continuous electronic fetal heart-rate monitoring is not 
routine, making generalisability to settings in which it is 
routine less certain.
The strengths of this study are its contemporaneous 
data collection and size. Potential weaknesses include 
the challenges of use of a composite primary outcome 
measure, the potential for staff to learn from exposure to 
the decision-support arm of the trial, resulting in 
improved outcomes in the control arm, and the issue of 
accounting for multiple comparisons. 
Use of a composite primary outcome might not always 
be helpful if different components of the outcome respond 
differently to the intervention.29 We initially hypothesised 
that the components of the outcome would have similar 
incidences, with each component likely to contribute 
around a third to the composite. Estimates of the incidence 
of these components for eligible women were difficult to 
find before the trial began.11 The perinatal mortality in our 
study (13 per 46 614 babies [0·3 per 1000]) was lower than 
the previous estimate (1·05 per 1000), and the incidence of 
neonatal encephalopathy requiring cooling was also lower 
than previous estimates (0·8 per 1000 vs 1·3 per 1000).11 
However, the incidence of prolonged admission to 
neonatal units with evidence of compromise at birth, for 
which we had no good data when planning the trial, 
occurred more frequently (291 per 46 614 [six per 1000]) 
and contributed substantially more to the higher-than-
anticipated overall primary event rate of seven per 1000 
compared with our estimated three per 1000. This 
frequency afforded us power to detect smaller differences 
in the composite outcome than we had originally planned.
The potential weakness of staff learning from exposure to 
the decision-support system was identified when planning 
the trial. We acknowledged that passive learning from the 
decision-support system would be possible. However, part 
of our previous hypothesis was that, although some poor 
cardiotocographic interpretation is due to a lack of training, 
some clinicians have poor intrinsic pattern-recognition 
abilities, which, by definition, would not be affected by 
training, and the performance of such clinicians would be 
particularly improved by assistance from automatic 
interpretation. We collected a range of process outcomes to 
measure the impact on clinician behaviour during the trial, 
and these data suggested some evidence for behaviour 
change in the decision-support arm: fetal blood sampling 
was more frequent and the incidence of repeated yellow

alerts lower than in the control group. Perhaps different 
action was taken in response to the alerts in the decision-
support arm of the trial—eg, clinicians might have reduced 
the dose of an oxytocin infusion in women having their 
labour augmented if the infusion was leading to very 
frequent contractions. Such actions could have prevented 
further yellow alerts, leading to a decrease in this group, 
although we do not have any direct evidence for this 
scenario. Even if this effect did occur, it did not result in any 
significant change in clinical outcomes. Although the 
median time from last level of red concern to birth might 
seem lengthy (58 min), some red levels of concern did not 
prompt immediate delivery—eg, the cardiotocographic 
monitor picking up the maternal heart rate. 
We accounted for multiple comparisons in the trial by 
using 99% CIs for all secondary outcomes. Significant 
findings in secondary outcomes require careful 
interpretation irrespective of the level of significance, 
and factors such as the strength of the finding and 
plausibility need to be taken into account.30 In this trial, 
the only two significant findings relate to behaviour 
change in clinicians favouring decision support. These 
findings  were in the expected direction of effect and are 
mutually supportive, suggestive of a real effect.
Detection of abnormalities in the fetal heart rate can 
improve outcome only if caregivers respond appropriately 
to the alerts. A review of all severe adverse outcomes in 
the trial showed no evidence of differences in suboptimal 
care between the two groups. Therefore our hypothesis 
that substandard care is largely related to failure to 
identify pathological fetal heart-rate patterns is not 
supported. Most adverse outcomes associated with 
preventable substandard care seemed to involve failure 
to take appropriate management decisions once the 
cardiotocographic abnormality had been recognised. 
This aspect will be reported in detail in a follow-up paper. 
Our hypothesis that unnecessary intervention would be 
reduced was also not supported.
The decision-support software used in this trial identifies 
fetal heart-rate abnormalities.6–8 However, the alerts do not 
take into account other information about the labour, such 
as duration of labour, the rate of labour progress, and 
presence of meconium, all of which could modify the way 
a clinician interprets the fetal heart rate and acts on this 
information. Further development of decision-support 
software could improve the quality of feedback that the 
system provides to clinicians to make a difference to 
outcomes. In view of the importance for parents, clinicians, 
and health services of the consequences of intrapartum 
hypoxia, identification of signs of early compromise during 
labour so that timely intervention can be used to reduce 
poor outcomes is an urgent unmet need.

Missing data are <3% unless otherwise presented; there were no apparent differences in missing data between trial arms. 
Effect measures were adjusted for stratification factors used in the randomisation (centre and twin birth) and clustering 
as a result of twins and multiple birth episodes. Stratification factors were not adjusted for in the analysis of infant deaths 
at 2 years and cerebral palsy because of the small number of events. Crude effect measures were not presented as 
identical to one decimal place (two decimal places for most outcomes). At 2 years, 29 (0·13%) of 21 508 infants had died 
in the decision-support group and 35 (0·16%) of 21 597 infants had died in the no-decision-support group (adjusted RR 
0·83 [99% CI 0·44–1·59])—all deaths were reported to age 2 years excluding stillbirths (one in the decision-support 
group and two in the no-decision-support group). Data from Ireland were not included in the numerator (n=1 in the 
decision-support group) or denominator (n=1754 in decision-support group and n=1752 in the no-decision-support 
group) because data for deaths after discharge were not available. CI=confidence interval. PARCA-R=Parent Report of 
Children’s Abilities—Revised. RR=risk ratio. *Disability in any of neuromotor function, seizures, auditory function, 
communication, visual function, cognitive function, or other physical disability.

Acknowledgments
This study was funded by the UK National Institute for Health Research 
(NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme (project number 
06.38.01). SK was partly funded by the NIHR Collaboration for Leadership 
in Applied Health Research and Care West Midlands. The quality-of-care 
review panel consisted of an obstetrician (PS), neonatologist (Ilya Kovar), 
and midwife (Christina McKenzie) for all sessions except one, when 
CM was replaced by Mary Griffin. Previous funding from the UK Medical 
Research Council enabled the initial development of Guardian and the 
INFANT software. The views and opinions expressed by authors in this 
publication are those of the authors and do not reflect those of the UK
