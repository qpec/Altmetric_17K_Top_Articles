IMPORTANCE Hypoglycemia is common during neonatal transition and may cause permanent
neurological impairment, but optimal intervention thresholds are unknown.
OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that neurodevelopment at 4.5 years is related to the
severity and frequency of neonatal hypoglycemia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Children With Hypoglycemia and Their Later
Development (CHYLD) Study is a prospective cohort investigation of moderate to late
preterm and term infants born at risk of hypoglycemia. Clinicians were masked to neonatal
interstitial glucose concentrations; outcome assessors were masked to neonatal glycemic
status. The setting was a regional perinatal center in Hamilton, New Zealand. The study was
conducted from December 2006 to November 2010. The dates of the follow-up were
September 2011 to June 2015. Participants were 614 neonates born from 32 weeks’gestation
with at least 1 risk factor for hypoglycemia, including diabetic mother, preterm, small, large, or
acute illness. Blood and masked interstitial glucose concentrations were measured for up to
7 days after birth. Infants with hypoglycemia (whole-blood glucose concentration <47 mg/dL)
were treated to maintain blood glucose concentration of at least 47 mg/dL.
EXPOSURES Neonatal hypoglycemic episode, defined as at least 1 consecutive blood glucose
concentration less than 47 mg/dL, a severe episode (<36 mg/dL), or recurrent (�3 episodes).
An interstitial episode was defined as an interstitial glucose concentration less than 47 mg/dL
for at least 10 minutes.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cognitive function, executive function, visual function,
and motor function were assessed at 4.5 years. The primary outcome was neurosensory
impairment, defined as poor performance in one or more domains.
RESULTS In total, 477 of 604 eligible children (79.0%) were assessed. Their mean (SD) age
at the time of assessment was 4.5 (0.1) years, and 228 (47.8%) were female. Those exposed
to neonatal hypoglycemia (280 [58.7%]) did not have increased risk of neurosensory
impairment (risk difference [RD], 0.01; 95% CI, −0.07 to 0.10 and risk ratio [RR], 0.96; 95%
CI, 0.77 to 1.21). However, hypoglycemia was associated with increased risk of low executive
function (RD, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.10 and RR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.17 to 4.59) and visual motor
function (RD, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.06 and RR, 3.67; 95% CI, 1.15 to 11.69), with highest risk
in children exposed to severe, recurrent, or clinically undetected (interstitial episodes only)
hypoglycemia.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Neonatal hypoglycemia was not associated with increased
risk of combined neurosensory impairment at 4.5 years but was associated with a
dose-dependent increased risk of poor executive function and visual motor function, even if
not detected clinically, and may thus influence later learning. Randomized trials are needed to
determine optimal screening and intervention thresholds based on assessment of
neurodevelopment at least to school age.

 T
he diagnosis and management of neonatal hypoglyce-
mia has been widely debated for more than 40 years,
with authorities recommending lower1 and higher2
thresholds for intervention and treatment, reflecting the pau-
city of high-quality evidence to guide management.3 The re-
sults of population studies4,5 have suggested that neonatal hy-
poglycemia may be one of the most readily preventable causes
ofneurodevelopmentalimpairmentandlearningdisorders,but
there is also the potential for iatrogenic harm from increased
intervention, including decreased breastfeeding and altered
cortical development from pain-induced stress with heel
lancing.6
To address these concerns, our group established the Chil-
dren With Hypoglycemia and Their Later Development
(CHYLD) Study to determine the effects of transitional hypo-
glycemia, including its severity and frequency, on neurode-
velopment and health outcomes.7 Herein, we report on neu-
rodevelopmental function at age 4.5 years.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
TheCHYLDStudyisaprospectivecohortinvestigationofmod-
erate to late preterm and term infants born from 32 weeks’ges-
tation with one or more risk factors for neonatal hypoglyce-
mia, including the following: diabetic mother, preterm (<37
weeks), small (<10th centile or <2500 g), large (>90th centile
or >4500 g), or acute illness. Infants were recruited to 1 of 2
studies (102 in the Babies and Blood Sugar’
s Influence on EEG
Study [BABIES] and 514 in the Sugar Babies Study; 2 infants
were in both studies), conducted from December 2006 to No-
vember 2010, at Waikato Hospital, Hamilton, New Zealand.8,9
The dates of the follow-up were September 2011 to June 2015.
Infants had regular measurement of whole-blood glucose by
the glucose oxidase method (ABL800 FLEX; Radiometer) ac-
cording to the clinical protocol; screening commenced at 1 to
2hoursafterbirth,thenevery3to4hoursforthefirst24hours,
and every 6 to 8 hours for the following 24 hours and up to 7
days, or until there was no ongoing clinical concern. Masked
interstitial continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) (CGMS Gold;
Medtronic MiniMed) was performed for up to 7 days, with off-
linerecalibration.10Hypoglycemia,definedaswhole-bloodglu-
cose concentration (BGC) less than 47 mg/dL, was treated with
additional feeding, buccal dextrose gel, and intravenous dex-
trose, with the aim of maintaining a BGC of at least 47 mg/dL
(to convert BGC to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). A
subgroup of infants (n = 214) in the Sugar Babies Study were
randomized to buccal dextrose gel or placebo for initial man-
agement of hypoglycemia, but all were eligible for subse-
quent open-label treatment with dextrose gel.9 Two-year neu-
rodevelopmental outcomes have been reported.7,11
All surviving children remaining in the study were eli-
gible for follow-up at 4.5 years’corrected age. Both neonatal
studies and the follow-up study were approved by the
Northern Y Regional Health and Disability Ethics Commit-
tee. Written informed consent was obtained at study entry
and at follow-up.
Follow-up Assessment
At 4.5 years’corrected age (±2 months), children underwent
assessment by a psychologist, a pediatrician, and an optom-
etrist, who were masked to neonatal glycemic status. Cogni-
tive ability was assessed by the Weschler Preschool and Pri-
mary Scale of Intelligence, Third Edition (WPPSI-3), including
full-scale IQ and verbal, performance, and processing speed
subscales, each with standardized mean (SD) of 100 (15).
A battery of 5 graded tasks was used to assess executive
function, including working memory (Digit Span),12 flexibil-
ity and attention (Dimensional Change Card Sort),13,14 delay in-
hibition (Gift Wrap Delay),15 and complex or conflict inhibi-
tion (Bear and Dragon and Day and Night Stroop).16 One point
was allocated for successfully completing the practice trials of
a task (“can do it”), 2 points for completing lower levels of a
task (“did do it”), and 3 points for completing more complex
levels of a task (“did advanced task”). Therefore, up to 6 points
could be scored for each task, and a composite executive func-
tion score was calculated as the sum of the individual task
scores, up to a maximum of 30 points (eTable 1 in Supple-
ment). If a child did not succeed with the practice or any trials,
he or she received a score of zero for that task.
Motor function was assessed by the Movement Assess-
mentBatteryforChildren-2(MABC-2),withstandardizedmean
(SD) of 10 (3),17 and the motor coordination subscale of the
Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual Motor Integra-
tion, Sixth Edition (BBVMI-6), with standardized mean (SD) of
100(15).18Cerebralpalsywasdiagnosedusingastructuredneu-
rological examination.
Optometric examination was performed as previously
described.19 Blindness and visual impairment were defined as
visual acuity in the better eye of at least 1.4 or at least 0.5 log-
MAR, respectively (Snellen ≥20/500 or ≥20/63, respectively).
A single point was assigned to each of the following vision as-
sessment categories if test results indicated the need for re-
ferral: (1) internal ocular pathology; (2) external ocular pathol-
ogy; (3) presence of strabismus; (4) absence of motor fusion
on the 20Δ prism test or muscle restrictions, weaknesses, or
imbalance evident on standard tests of ocular motility, smooth
pursuit, and near point of convergence; (5) if stereopsis was
Key Points
Question What is the relationship between neonatal
hypoglycemia, including the severity and frequency, and
neurodevelopmental outcomes?
Findings In this prospective cohort study of 477 at-risk children,
neonatal hypoglycemia (<47 mg/dL) was not associated with
combined neurosensory impairment at 4.5 years but was
associated with impaired executive function and visual motor
function. Severe, recurrent, and clinically undetected episodes
increased this risk.
Meaning Neonatal hypoglycemia may increase the risk of
impaired executive function and visual motor function in a
dose-dependent fashion, even if not detected clinically, and may
thus influence later learning; randomized trials to determine
optimal intervention thresholds need to assess neurodevelopment
at least to school age.

 not measurable on either the Randot, Lang, or Frisby stereo-
tests; and (6) visual acuity worse than 0.3 logMAR (Snellen 20/
40) in either eye or difference between eyes worse than 0.1 log-
MAR (more than 1 line). A vision composite score was
calculated as the sum of 6 vision assessment categories, up to
a maximum of 6 points.
Global motion perception was measured as the motion co-
herence threshold, determined from random dot kineto-
grams of varying coherence using an adaptive staircase pro-
cedure (lower threshold indicates better perception).19 Visual
processing was also assessed by the visual processing sub-
scaleoftheBBVMI-6,withstandardizedmean(SD)of100(15).18
Deafness was defined as hearing impairment requiring
aids. Auditory processing was assessed by the auditory sub-
scale (items 6 to 8) of the Phelps Kindergarten Readiness Scale,
with standardized mean (SD) of 10 (3).20 Visual motor integra-
tion was measured by the BBVMI-6, with standardized mean
(SD) of 100 (15).18
Parental questionnaires were used to screen for emo-
tional and behavioral problems (Strengths and Difficulties
Questionnaire [SDQ]21 and Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]22),
executive dysfunction (Behavior Rating Inventory of Execu-
tiveFunction,PreschoolVersion[BRIEF-P]23),andautistictraits
(Social Communication Questionnaire [SComQ] lifetime
form24). Parental questionnaires were also used to obtain in-
formation on the home and family environment.
Statistical Analysis
The sample size was limited by the size of the inception co-
horts. We estimated that if 470 children were assessed and half
were exposed to neonatal hypoglycemia,25 the study would
have 80% power to detect an increase in the primary out-
come from 25% to 37% (12% absolute increase and 48% rela-
tive increase) and, for normally distributed data, a difference
of 0.25 SD at the 5% significance level.
All outcomes were defined and analyses conducted
according to a prespecified study protocol unless stated oth-
erwise. The primary outcome was neurosensory impair-
ment, defined as any of the following: visual impairment,
deafness, cerebral palsy, full-scale IQ or visual motor inte-
gration score exceeding 1 SD below the test mean, MABC-2
total score less than 15th centile, or motion coherence
threshold or executive function score worse than 1.5 SDs
from the cohort mean. Prespecified secondary outcomes
included the following: (1) individual components of the pri-
mary outcome and associated subscales and proportion of
children with low test scores; (2) SDQ, CBCL, BRIEF-P, and
SComQ scores and proportion of children with scores in the
clinical range; and (3) proportion of children with a neurode-
velopmental disorder, history of afebrile seizures, senso-
rimotor impairment (cerebral palsy, visual impairment, deaf-
ness, or MABC-2 total score <5th centile), and combined
emotional-behavioral difficulty (SDQ, CBCL, BRIEF-P, or
SComQ score in the clinical range).
Hypoglycemic definitions were as reported previously.7
Hypoglycemia was defined as at least 1 episode of consecu-
tive BGCs less than 47 mg/dL, severe hypoglycemia as an
episode less than 36 mg/dL, and recurrent hypoglycemia
as at least 3 episodes. Interstitial episodes were defined as
at least 10 minutes below these thresholds. Hypoglycemic
events were defined as the sum of nonconcurrent whole-
blood and interstitial episodes less than 47 mg/dL more than
20 minutes apart.
The primary analyses compared primary and secondary
outcomes between children with and without hypoglycemic
episodes in the first week after birth using generalized linear
regression models (binomial or normal distribution) ad-
justed for predefined potential confounders (socioeconomic
decile,26 sex, and primary risk factor for neonatal hypoglyce-
mia). The data analysis was performed using statistical soft-
ware (SAS, version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc). Results are pre-
sented as risk ratios (RRs) on binary outcomes or mean
differences on continuous outcomes, with 95% CIs. Two-
sided tests with P < .05 were considered statistically signifi-
cant, with no adjustment for multiple comparisons.
The secondary analyses related the primary outcome and
full-scaleIQtotheseverityandfrequencyofhypoglycemia,un-
detected low glucose concentration (detected only on masked
CGM),continuousmeasuresofhigherglucose(meanandmaxi-
mum in the first 12 and 48 hours), and glucose instability (pro-
portion of glucose concentrations outside the central band of
54 to 72 mg/dL in the first 48 hours).7 Receiver operating char-
acteristic curves were used to explore the diagnostic value of
continuous measures of hypoglycemia for the primary out-
come, including the number of events, minimum BGC, and
negative interstitial glucose increment (area above the inter-
stitial glucose concentration curve and below thresholds rang-
ing from 54 to 32 mg/dL).7 Repeated-measures mixed models
explored trends over time.

 children assessed, the primary outcome was available for 473
(78.3% of those eligible) (Figure 1). Compared with those as-
sessed, children not assessed at 4.5 years were more likely to
be of European or other ethnicity but were less likely to have
been exposed to prenatal smoking and alcohol and neonatal
hypoglycemia or admitted to neonatal intensive care (Table 1).
Children assessed at 2 years but not at 4.5 years had higher risk
of neurosensory impairment at 2 years compared with those
assessed at both time points (55.1% [27 of 49] vs 35.2% [125 of
355]) (eTable 2 in Supplement).
Neonatal hypoglycemia occurred in 280 infants (58.7%),
of whom 111 (39.6%) had at least 1 severe episode and 53
(18.9%) had recurrent hypoglycemia (≥3 episodes). Children
who experienced hypoglycemia compared with those who
did not were less likely to be an infant of a diabetic mother
and were more likely to be female and to be admitted to neo-
natal intensive care (Table 1). Among infants with hypoglyce-
mia, those with severe or recurrent episodes were more likely
to have a mother with pregestational diabetes (14.2% [17 of
120] vs 6.6% [9 of 137], P = .04), but there was no association
with other baseline maternal and infant characteristics.
Masked CGM was performed in 377 infants (79.0%), of whom
32 had at least 1 episode of low interstitial glucose concentra-
tions but normal BGCs (21.7% of those without clinically
detected hypoglycemia).
Primary Analyses
Children who were and were not exposed to neonatal hypo-
glycemia had similar risk of neurosensory impairment
(37.4% vs 38.5%; risk difference [RD], 0.01; 95% CI, −0.07 to
0.10 and RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.21) (Table 2). Among
secondary outcomes, children exposed to hypoglycemia had
a greater risk of low executive function score (10.6% vs 4.7%;

 Secondary Analyses
The severity and frequency of hypoglycemic episodes or pres-
enceofundetectedlowinterstitialglucoseconcentrationswere
not related to neurosensory impairment or full-scale IQ at 4.5
years (Figure 2). However, children in the lowest quintile for
mean and maximum interstitial glucose concentrations in the
first 12 hours after birth had increased risk of neurosensory im-
pairment (Figure 3). There was no association between pro-
portion of blood and interstitial glucose concentrations out-
side the central band in the first 48 hours and neurosensory
impairment or full-scale IQ. The number of hypoglycemic
events, minimum BGC, and negative interstitial glucose in-
crement did not predict neurosensory impairment at 4.5 years
(eTable 3 in Supplement). Interstitial glucose profiles of chil-
dren with and without neurosensory impairment at 4.5 years
were similar, including those who experienced neonatal hy-
poglycemia treated with dextrose, either intravenous or buc-
cal (eFigure in Supplement).
In post hoc analysis, the risk of a low executive function
score and a low visual motor integration score was greatest in
children exposed to severe hypoglycemia (Figure 2). The risk
ofalowexecutivefunctionscorewassimilarlyincreasedinchil-
dren exposed to 1 or 2 episodes and at least 3 episodes, but the
riskofalowvisualmotorintegrationscorewasgreatestinthose
exposed to at least 3 episodes. A low executive function score
was more common in children with exposure to clinically un-
detected low glucose concentrations (interstitial monitoring
only) compared with children with no hypoglycemic events
(12.5% [4 of 32] vs 3.5% [4 of 115]; RR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.23-
12.85), but the risk of low visual motor integration score was
similar between these groups.
In a post hoc subgroup analysis, interstitial glucose pro-
files were examined in children assessed at both 2 years and
4.5 years. Children who developed neurosensory impair-
ment between 2 years and 4.5 years had a steeper rise in
interstitial glucose concentration after hypoglycemia,
whereas children who had stable neurosensory status, either
normal or impaired at both time points, had similar intersti-
tial glucose concentrations in the first 48 hours (eFigure in
Supplement).
Because follow-up at 2 years was limited to children born
from 35 weeks’gestation, we performed a sensitivity analysis
that excluded children born at 32 to 34 weeks (n = 38). This ex-
clusiondidnotsubstantiallyaltertheassociationbetweenneo-
natalhypoglycemiaandtheriskoflowexecutivefunctionscore
and visual motor integration score at 4.5 years.

 cemia may have widespread effects in the developing brain, in-
cluding the frontal cortex,27 later childhood follow-up was
planned. The present study has shown that at 4.5 years, while
neonatalhypoglycemiawasnotassociatedwithmajorneurologi-
caldeficits,itwasassociatedwitha2-foldto3-foldincreasedrisk
of poor executive and visual motor performance.
By age 4.5 years, children have markedly increased capac-
ity for problem solving, planning, attention control, and goal-
directed behavior, collectively referred to as executive func-
tion.Impaireddevelopmentofthesefacultiesisassociatedwith
increased risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, con-
duct disorder, and learning problems.28 We found that the risk
ofpoorperformanceacross5executivefunctiontaskswasmore
thantwiceascommonamongchildrenexposedtoneonatalhy-
poglycemia, potentially leading to behavioral and educational
difficulties at school age. Indeed, the increased SDQ scores in
the clinical range, indicative of reduced emotional and behav-
ioral regulation,21 may signal the start of such a trajectory.

 The BBVMI-6 assesses integration of visual processing and
motor coordination, and low visual motor integration scores
have been associated with poor performance in reading, math-
ematics, and writing, which are skills with a strong visuospa-
tial basis.29 Neonatal hypoglycemia, if associated with both re-
duced executive and visual motor function, may be an
important risk factor for schooling difficulties, as found in a
recent large population study.4
Neonatal hypoglycemia has been traditionally associated
with injury of the occipital lobes,30 which include the pri-
mary visual cortices and several extrastriate visual areas. How-
ever, more widespread injury has been reported more
recently,31 and we did not detect any other adverse effects on
visual development, despite detailed testing, including global
motion perception. This finding may be due to the fact that
we used a prospective cohort study design, which is at less risk
of selection bias than retrospective case series.
Limitations and Strengths
These results of an observational study must be interpreted
cautiously.Wetestedawiderangeofneuropsychologicalfunc-
tions, most of which were similar between groups, so it is pos-
sible that our positive findings represent residual confound-
ing or type I errors. However, we prospectively hypothesized
that executive function and visual motor skills may be af-
fected by hypoglycemia based on early reports32,33 and the fact
that concurrent impairment of these skills is not uncommon
in children with learning problems. Furthermore, the appar-
ent dose-response relationship between the severity and fre-
quency of hypoglycemic episodes and the risk of low execu-
tive and visual motor function also makes it more likely that
our findings represent true associations.
Continuous glucose monitoring of neonates at risk
detects more episodes of low glucose concentrations than
does intermittent blood glucose monitoring, and our group
has previously argued against routine use of this technology
because the clinical significance of these additional episodes
is unknown.8 To our knowledge, the present study shows for
the first time that clinically undetected low glucose concen-
trations may be associated with a 4-fold increased risk of
executive dysfunction. We also found that children with the
lowest interstitial glucose concentrations in the first 12 hours
after birth had increased risk of combined neurosensory
impairment. This finding, taken together with a recent
report that transient neonatal hypoglycemia detected on
whole-population screening was associated with decreased
school achievement in literacy and mathematics,4 raises the
question of whether currently recommended intermittent
blood glucose screening of infants at risk is sufficient or
whether more intensive screening or prophylactic measures
should be assessed.
Nevertheless, it should not be assumed that more aggres-
sive intervention would necessarily improve outcomes. At 2
years,neurosensoryimpairmentwasassociatedwithhigherand
less stable glucose concentrations in the first 48 hours, al-
though still within the normal range.7 This association was
strongest among hypoglycemic infants who received dex-
trose, raising concern that rapid correction of hypoglycemia to
higher glucose concentrations may lead to poorer outcome. In
animal studies, higher glucose concentrations after hypogly-
cemia can worsen neuronal injury due to generation of reac-
tive oxygen species34 and changes in cerebral perfusion.35 Al-
thoughwedidnotseethesamerelationshipbetweeninterstitial
glucoseprofilesandneurosensoryimpairmentat4.5years,chil-
dren who had worsening of neurological status between as-
sessments had a more rapid rise in glucose concentrations af-
ter initial hypoglycemia, similar to that observed previously.
It remains to be determined whether glucose instability is on
the causal pathway of neuronal injury or is simply a marker of
perinatal stress.
Our study was prospective, used masked interstitial glu-
cose monitoring, involved a comprehensive neurodevelop-
mental assessment, and was adequately powered to detect
clinically important differences in outcomes, but, like any ob-
servational study, was limited by inability to determine cau-
sation. In addition, only 78.3% of eligible children were as-
sessed, and those lost to follow-up had slightly lower rates of
several perinatal risk factors. However, results of children seen
at 2 years but not at 4.5 years suggest that those lost to fol-
low-up had higher rates of neurosensory impairment; there-
fore, our study may underestimate the risks associated with
neonatal hypoglycemia.
In this longitudinal cohort study, we have demonstrated
the potential for adverse outcomes with both undertreat-
ment and overtreatment of neonatal hypoglycemia, particu-
larly among infants with less stable glucose concentrations. In-
tervention studies are now needed to determine optimal
glycemicmanagementforimprovinglong-termoutcomes.Fur-
thermore, because the relationship between neonatal hypo-
glycemia and neurodevelopment is complex and changes
over time, it is essential that infants in randomized trials are
followed up to school age. Such studies will be expensive;
however, given that approximately 15% of all newborns
experience hypoglycemia25 and hypoglycemia may influ-
ence educational outcomes, the potential for benefit may be
great.
Conclusions
Neonatal hypoglycemia, when treated to maintain BGCs of at
least 47 mg/dL, was not associated with increased risk of com-
bined neurosensory impairment at 4.5 years but was associ-
ated with a dose-dependent increased risk of poor executive
and visual motor function. Randomized trials are needed to
determineoptimalscreeningandinterventionthresholdsbased
on assessment of neuropsychological development at least to
school age.
