We evaluated the extent of attenuation and immunogenicity of the �lppAB and
�lppAB �msbB mutants of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium when delivered
to mice by the oral route. These mutants were deleted either for the Braun lipoprotein
genes (lppA and lppB) or in combination with the msbB gene, which encodes an
acetyltransferase required for lipid A modification of lipopolysaccharide. Both the
mutants were attenuated (100% animal survival) and triggered robust innate and
adaptive immune responses. Comparable levels of IgG and its isotypes were produced
in mice infected with wild-type (WT) S. typhimurium or its aforementioned mutant
strains. The �lppAB �msbB mutant-immunized animals resulted in the production
of higher levels of fecal IgA and serum cytokines during later stages of vaccination
(adaptive response). A significant production of interleukin-6 from T-cells was also
noted in the �lppAB �msbB mutant-immunized mice when compared to that of the
�lppAB mutant. On the other hand, IL-17A production was significantly more in the
serum of �lppAB mutant-immunized mice (innate response) with a stronger splenic
T-cell proliferative and tumor-necrosis factor-α production. Based on 2-dimensional gel
analysis, alterations in the levels of several proteins were observed in both the mutant
strains when compared to that in WT S. typhimurium and could be associated with
the higher immunogenicity of the mutants. Finally, both �lppAB and �lppAB �msbB
mutants provided complete protection to immunized mice against a lethal oral challenge
dose of WT S. typhimurium. Thus, these mutants may serve as excellent vaccine
candidates and also provide a platform for delivering heterologous antigens.

Immunogenicity of Salmonella typhimurium Mutants
INTRODUCTION
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a food-borne
pathogen that causes self-limiting gastroenteritis in healthy
individuals. The global burden for non-typhoidal salmonellosis
(NTS) was estimated at 93 million cases and 155,000 deaths in
2010 (Majowicz et al., 2010). Infection with S. typhimurium in
immunologically compromised adults (e.g., HIV+) and children
under the age of three, may lead to invasive non-typhoidal
salmonellosis (iNTS) characterized by systemic infection and
bacteremia, particularly in Africa and parts of south-east Asia,
with approximately one million clinical cases per year (Feasey
et al., 2012). The case fatality rate for iNTS bacteremia was
reported at 25% (Reddy et al., 2010; Gordon, 2011). Antibiotics
are the first choice to treat Salmonella infections; however,
the rapidly emerging antibiotic resistance among Salmonella
serovars has been a significant concern (Anderson, 1975). In the
United States, it is estimated that ∼7% of NTS infections are
invasive, of which about 5% are fatal (Vugia et al., 2004). NTS
strains resistant to multiple antibiotics complicate the treatment
of iNTS (Anderson, 1975; Varma et al., 2005). In addition,
Salmonella can be used as a bioweapon, as occurred in the
intentional contamination of restaurant salad bars in Oregon by
a religious cult, which resulted in ∼1000 cases of gastroenteritis
(Greenfield et al., 2002).
Currently, there is no vaccine available for NTS in humans.
Several S. typhimurium mutants such as �aroA (Hormaeche
et al., 1990, 1991), �crp �cdt (Zhang X. et al., 1997; Zhang
et al., 1999), �phoP (Galán and Curtiss, 1989), �relA �spoT
(Na et al., 2006), or �aroC �ssaV (designated as WT05; Hindle
et al., 2002) have been developed and showed attenuation in
mice. These deleted genes have been implicated in a variety
of biological functions. For example, the aroA and aeroC are
involved in the bacterial aromatic (Aro) pathway (Hormaeche
et al., 1991), while the cdt gene product plays an important role
in bacterial colonization of deep tissues in the host (Zhang X.
et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 1999). Likewise, the crp gene encodes
cyclic AMP receptor protein and acts as a global transcriptional
regulator (Shimada et al., 2013). A similar regulatory role has
also been assigned to PhoP (Groisman et al., 1989). On the
other hand, RelA and SpoT are responsible for synthesizing
bacterial signal molecule ppGpp (Pizarro-Cerdá and Tedin,
2004), while ssaV encodes a crucial inner membrane structure
component of the type III secretion system (T3SS) on the
pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) of Salmonella (Hindle et al.,
2002).
Although, animals vaccinated with the aforementioned
mutants were protected against a dose >104-fold above the LD50
of the parental Salmonella strains, these mutants were found to
be either reactogenic or had disappointing immunogenicity in
human clinical trials (Tennant et al., 2011; Strugnell et al., 2014).
In addition, these live attenuated S. typhimurium vaccine strains
were shed in the feces for longer periods of time, which is an
undesirable trait for any vaccine (Tennant et al., 2011).
To address the rising concerns of iNTS, several new
gene targets (e.g., guaBA and clpP or lon, encoding guanine
biosynthesis proteins and ATP-dependent protease, respectively)
have been deleted singly or in combination with other genes
from S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis (Tennant et al., 2011;
Matsui et al., 2015). Importantly, the lon and sulA (encoding the
suppressor of lon) double deletion mutants of S. typhimurium
and S. enteritidis showed cross protection in animal models
(Tennant et al., 2011; Matsui et al., 2015). In addition, attenuated
Salmonella strains have been used as vehicles to deliver foreign
antigens. For example, a novel attenuated S. typhimurium strain
SL368 derived from the auxotrophic S. typhimurium aroA strain
SL7207 by deleting part of the spiR coding sequence, was
used to express hemagglutinin as well as neuraminidase of a
highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus. This strain provided
protection to mice against both H5N1 and H1N1 viral infections
(Pei et al., 2015). Likewise, an oral vaccine for type 1 diabetes was
based on live attenuated S. typhimurium strain Mvp728 (�htrA
�purD) that expressed diabetic autoantigen preproinsulin and
transforming growth factor (TGF)-β (Husseiny et al., 2014).
One of the most serious complications of S. typhimurium
infection is septic shock in humans and animals, which is
mainly mediated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Parrillo, 1993).
We previously reported that Braun (murein) lipoprotein (Lpp)
also contributed significantly to septic shock induction (Sha et al.,
2004; Fadl et al., 2005a,b). Lpp is 5- to 9- kDa in size (Braun and
Hantke, 1974; Braun, 1975; Zhang H. et al., 1997; Fenton and
Golenbock, 1998) and encoded by two functional copies of the lpp
gene (lppA and lppB) which are located in tandem and separated
by 82 bp on the chromosome of S. typhimurium 14028 (Sha et al.,
2004). Lpp synergizes with LPS to produce pro-inflammatory
cytokines/chemokines (Braun, 1975; Sha et al., 2004; Fadl et al.,
2005b). While LPS activates cellular responses by binding to
CD14 receptor and via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 (Ulevitch and
Tobias, 1995; Aliprantis et al., 1999; Tobias et al., 1999), Lpp
triggers TLR-2 to activate host cell signaling (Aliprantis et al.,
1999). In Escherichia coli and S. typhimurium, the msbB (multi-
copy suppressor of htrB [high temperature requirement B]) gene
encodes an acyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of lauric
acid (C12) to the lipid A moiety of LPS, thus increasing its
biological potency (Clementz et al., 1996, 1997; Somerville et al.,
1996; Rebeil et al., 2006). Mutation in the msbB gene impaired
Salmonella’s ability to cause lethality in mice and to induce tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and inducible nitric
oxide (iNOS) production (Kalupahana et al., 2003).
In our previous studies, we generated various individual
(�lppA and �lppB) and combinatorial lpp and msbB (�lppAB,
�lppA �msbB, �lppB �msbB, and �lppAB �msbB) gene
deletion mutants of S. typhimurium 14028 and characterized
them both in vitro and in vivo models of salmonellosis (Sha et al.,
2004; Fadl et al., 2005a,b; Liu et al., 2008). We demonstrated
that mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) immunized with these various
mutant strains were protected from the lethal challenge dose
(given by the i.p. route) of wild-type (WT) S. typhimurium.
Furthermore, serum IgG1 antibody titers, T-cell proliferation,
as well as the expression of T cell activation maker CD44,
were substantially higher in mice i.p. immunized with the
mutant strains when compared to that of WT S. typhimurium-
infected animals (Liu et al., 2008). Both the �lppAB and
�lppAB �msbB mutants were among the most attenuated and

immunogenic ones, and, therefore, were considered as excellent
vaccine candidates against S. typhimurium infection (Liu et al.,
2008).
Oral inoculation is not only the natural route of Salmonella
infection in the host but also the easiest and least invasive
method of immunization. In the present study, we analyzed
the immunological responses, including IgA levels, of inbred
(C57BL/6J) mice that were orally immunized with the �lppAB
or �lppAB �msbB mutants. In addition, we studied bacterial
protein profiling alterations attributed to the lpp and/or
msbB gene deletions by 2-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis
and analysis. We detected changes in the levels of several
potential immunogenic proteins in both the mutant strains,
and demonstrated that �lppAB and �lppAB �msbB mutants
induced robust innate and adaptive immune responses in mice
and protected them from the lethal oral challenge with WT
S. typhimurium. Our presented data further validate the vaccine
potential of the mutants and we provide a possible mechanistic
basis for the protection provided by these mutants in mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial Strains
WT S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028 was purchased
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas,
VA. The �lppAB and �lppAB �msbB mutants were generated
in our laboratory (Sha et al., 2004; Fadl et al., 2005a,b). The
Salmonella strains were grown either in Luria-Bertani (LB) or
on MSB medium, the latter consisted of LB medium with
no NaCl but supplemented with 2 mM MgSO4 and 2 mM
CaCl2 (Murray et al., 2001). Bacterial cells from the exponential
growth phase at 37◦C were harvested and used for both animal
studies (immunization and challenge) and 2D gel electrophoresis
analysis. All of the Salmonella strains were periodically examined
on Salmonella-Shigella (SS) agar plates (Difco, Detroit, MI) for
purity.
Serum Antibodies and Cytokines As Well
As Fecal IgA in Mice Orally Infected with
S. typhimurium Strains
Six-to-eight week old C57BL/6J female mice were obtained from
the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Animals were first
fasted for at least 4 h and then orally dosed with 100 µl of bacterial
suspension with a mouse stomach tube (Sigma, St. Lois, MO).
The bacterial doses were prepared in 5% sodium bicarbonate
solution to overcome stomach acidity. Briefly, mice (n = 10 per
group) were orally infected with 2.0 × 106 colony forming units
(CFU)/100 µl of WT S. typhimurium (our calculated LD50 was
2.0 × 105 CFU) or its �lppAB or �lppAB �msbB mutants. Blood
from the surviving animals from four independent experiments
was collected by retro-orbital bleeding on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, and
21 post infection (p.i.). Total IgG and its isotype antibody titers
to the whole bacterial cells on days 14 and 21 p.i. were evaluated
by ELISA in serially diluted serum as we previously described
(van Lier et al., 2014). Briefly, ELISA plates were first coated
with the whole bacterial cells overnight at 4◦C. For preparing the
bacterial cells, the WT S. typhimurium was grown at 37◦C until an
OD600nm of 0.8 was reached. The culture was then resuspended
to a concentration of 5 × 109 CFU/ml and used to coat the
plates treated with poly-L-lysine (10 µg/ml). A serial dilution
(1:5) of serum was made to evaluate antibody titers, and a positive
antibody titer was defined as the inverse of the highest serum
dilution giving an absorbance reading of ≥0.2. Antibody classes
and IgG isotypes were also examined by using specific isotype
secondary antibodies as we previously described (van Lier et al.,
2014).
Likewise, the serum cytokine levels were examined on days
1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 p.i. by using a mouse 6-plex assay kit
(Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA; Tiner et al., 2015).
The fecal matter was collected on day 21 p.i. and suspended
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.15 mg soybean
trypsin inhibitor and 25 mM EDTA (ethylenedinitrilo tetraacetic
acid) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). To measure the level of
IgA, the ELISA plates were first coated with anti-IgA antibody
(without biotinylation), and then the serial dilutions of fecal
suspension were added to the plates. After 2 h incubation at room
temperature followed by serial washes, the biotinylated anti-IgA
antibody with the peroxidase-labeled streptavidin were applied.
After further incubation, washes, and addition of the substrate,
the plates were read under OD450mm and the values were
normalized by their corresponding total protein concentrations
(µg/ml) in the fecal suspensions (Cong et al., 1998; Cao
et al., 2012). Four independent experiments were performed
and the pooled data (each sample was run in duplicate) were
presented with statistical analysis. All of the animal studies were
performed under an approved Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee protocol.
Oral Immunization, Challenge, and
Histopathological Analysis
C57BL/6J
mice
(n

were
orally
immunized/infected with 3 × 103
CFU/100 µl of WT
S. typhimurium and its �lppAB or �lppAB �msbB mutants.
After 36 days, mice were challenged via the oral route with
2 × 106 CFU/100 µl of WT S. typhimurium. Our goal was
to discern efficacy of the vaccine strains at a low dose of 3 ×
103 CFU.
In a parallel experiment, mice (n = 5 per group) were orally
immunized with a high dose of 1 × 108 CFU (∼1000 LD50
of WT S. typhimurium) of �lppAB or the �lppAB �msbB
mutant and all survived. After 21 days, the immunized animals
along with naïve control mice (n = 5) were challenged with
1 × 108 CFU of WT S. typhimurium via the oral route. Organs
from these challenged animals were excised on either day 7 (for
unimmunized mice that were infected with WT S. typhimurium
before succumbing to infection) or day 21 (for immunized and
challenged animals, all survived). The organs were fixed in 10%
neutral buffered formalin (Sha et al., 2008; Agar et al., 2009)
and tissues processed and sectioned at 5 µm. The samples were
mounted on slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E). Tissue lesions were scored on the basis of a severity scale,
which correlated with estimates of lesion distribution and the

extent of tissue involvement, as we previously described (Sha
et al., 2008; Agar et al., 2009). The histopathological evaluation
of the tissue sections was performed in a blinded fashion.
T-Cell Proliferative Responses and
Cytokine Production
Mice (n = 5) were orally immunized with 1 × 108 CFU
of �lppAB or the �lppAB �msbB mutant, and spleens were
harvested on day 21 post immunization. We chose a higher
dosage of the mutants for vaccination as Salmonella vaccines
are administered at a dosage range of 107-1010 CFU in humans,
e.g., S. typhi Ty21a (WHO, 2014) or other typhoid vaccine
candidates that have undergone clinical trials (Tacket et al., 2000;
Tacket and Levine, 2007). T-cells from the mutant-immunized
mice were isolated, and their ability to proliferate as well
as to produce cytokines was evaluated upon co-culture with
the γ-irradiated and heat-killed WT S. typhimurium-stimulated
antigen-presenting cells (APCs; pulsed). T-cells incubated with
γ-irradiated naïve APCs (without the bacterial stimulation; un-
pulsed) served as controls (Sha et al., 2013; van Lier et al.,
2014). After 72 h of incubation, 1µCi of [3H] thymidine
was added to a set of each co-culture well, and the cells
harvested 16 h later using a semi-automated sample harvester,
FilterMate Harvester (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA), followed
by the measurement of radioactive counts (TopCount NXT,
PerkinElmer). Likewise, from another set of the T-cell cultures,
a portion of the supernatant was collected at 48 and 72 h
to measure cytokine/chemokine production by using a mouse
6-plex assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.).
Two-Dimensional (2D) Gel Electrophoresis
and Mass Spectrometric Analysis
Bacterial cells (mutants and WT S. typhimurium) were lysed in 8
M urea, 4% CHAPS [3-(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio-
1-propanesulfonate], and 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), followed
by 10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation to remove
salts and to concentrate proteins. The TCA precipitated proteins
were re-dissolved in the lysis solution and subjected to 2D gel
electrophoresis as we previously described (Chopra et al., 2006).
For each vaccine strain, the above prepared samples were
run in triplicate gels, and the WT S. typhimurium sample-
containing gels were set as a reference during analysis by using
Progenesis Workstation (NonlinearDynamics, Durham, NC) at the
Protein Chemistry Laboratory, UTMB. The normalized volume
(NV) of each spot was calculated by using the total volume
normalization method in which each spot on a gel image was
expressed relative to the total volume of all spots on that image,
and then normalized to the total volume of all spots on the
reference gel image (Berth et al., 2007). The detected spots with
NVs of ≤60 were filtered out. The NVs of the corresponding
spots from gels containing samples of WT S. typhimurium
and its two mutants were compared, and a fold-change of ≥2
was considered as differentially expressed/produced proteins.
Some of these well separated protein spots (a total of 61)
were picked robotically, trypsin-digested, and peptides identified
by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight
Mass Spectrometry (MALDI TOF-MS) at the Protein Chemistry
Laboratory, UTMB.
Statistics
Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Tukey’s post-
hoc test or the multiple Student’s t-test with the Holm-sidak
post-hoc test correction was used for data analysis. We used
Kaplan–Meier survival estimates or Fisher exact test for animal
studies, and p ≤ 0.05 were considered significant for all of the
statistical tests used.
RESULTS
Attenuation of the �lppAB and �lppAB
�msbB Mutants of S. typhimurium in an
Oral Mouse Model of Infection
Our previous studies with both �lppAB and �lppAB �msbB
mutants in mice were focused on the i.p. model of infection
(Sha et al., 2004; Fadl et al., 2005a,b; Liu et al., 2008). Both
the mutant strains displayed significantly decreased virulence
phenotype and provided protection to mice upon subsequent
WT S. typhimurium lethal challenge. However, their potential as
vaccine strains (attenuation and protection) in the oral infection
mouse model was not characterized and formed the basis of
this study. As shown in Figure 1A, when mice were orally
challenged with WT S. typhimurium at the dose of 2.0 × 106
CFU (∼10LD50), animals started to die at day 8 p.i., and 90% of
them eventually succumbed to infection by day 16 p.i. In sharp
contrast, 100% of the mice infected with either the �lppAB and
or the �lppAB �msbB mutant at the same dose of 2.0 × 106 CFU
survived up to tested 30 days, and no signs of the disease were
observed during the course of infection (Figure 1A).
Mouse Serum Antibody Titers and Fecal
IgA Production
Specific anti-S. typhimurium antibodies were evaluated on
days 14 and 21 p.i. from the above infected groups of mice.
Compared to the pre-immune serum, animals in all of the
infected groups (WT S. typhimurium and the �lppAB and
�lppAB �msbB mutants) developed high levels (∼1:10,000) of
Salmonella specific IgG antibodies on day 14 p.i. (Figure 1B).
More specifically, all infected mice had similar levels of total IgG
and IgG2b isotypes; however, slightly higher levels of IgG1 and
IgG2a were observed in the mutant-infected groups of animals
when compared to mice in the WT S. typhimurium-infected
group (Figure 1B).
On day 21 p.i., the total IgG titers remained unchanged in
the �lppAB mutant-infected mice, while it slightly dropped in
animals infected with WT S. typhimurium when compared to
that on day 14 p.i. (Figures 1B,C). In contrast, the total IgG
titers in the �lppAB �msbB mutant-infected mice continued to
mount (>1:100,000) on day 21 p.i. (Figure 1C). Likewise, the
IgG isotype titers in all of the infected mice were maintained
essentially at the similar levels when comparisons were made for
days 14 and 21 p.i., with the exception of the level of IgG2a in WT

S. typhimurium-infected group and was based on Kaplan–Meier Curve
Analysis (0.0027) and Fisher exact test (0.0079). Blood from animals was
collected and the titers of IgG and its isotypes (serial dilutions of serum) to the
whole bacterial cells on days 14 (B) and 21 (C) post infection (p.i.) were
evaluated by ELISA. Serum collected on day 0 before infection served as a
pre-immune control. Data were analyzed by using multiple Student’s t-test
with the Holm–sidak post-hoc test correction. The statistical significances
were indicated either by asterisks when comparted to the pre-immune serum
or by a line for the compared groups with the P-values. Mice fecal matter was
collected on day 21 p.i., and the level of IgA in the fecal suspension was
assessed by ELISA and the OD450mm values were normalized by their
corresponding total protein concentrations (µg/ml) in the fecal suspensions
(D). Two-way ANOVA with the Tukey’s post-hoc correction was used to
analyze the data, and the statistical significances were indicated either by
asterisks when compared to WT S. typhimurium-infected mice or by a line for
the compared groups with the P-value. The presented data were pooled from
4 independent experiments representing 4–8 animals/group.
S. typhimurium-infected animals which dropped back to the level
detected in the pre-immune serum (Figure 1C).
The intestinal secretory IgA was also monitored during the
course of infection, and a significant level of fecal IgA was
detected on day 21 p.i. from all of the infected mice, whether with
WT S. typhimurium or its �lppAB or �lppAB �msbB mutants.
However, the highest level of IgA was noted in mice infected with
the �lppAB �msbB mutant followed by the �lppAB mutant,
and then the WT S. typhimurium-infected group of animals
(Figure 1D).
Levels of Cytokines in Mice Serum during
the Course of Infection with WT
S. typhimurium and Its Mutants
Serum cytokines were monitored periodically by Bioplex during
the course of infection. In general, irrespective of whether the
mice were infected with WT S. typhimurium or its designated
mutants, the levels of examined cytokines, except for IL-6 and
interferon (IFN)-γ, were higher in the serum on day 1 p.i. when
compared to the pre-immune serum (Figure 2). The levels of all
examined cytokines were also maintained at significantly higher
levels during the later stages of infection (i.e., days 14 or 21 p.i.),
indicating the mounting of both early (innate) and late (adaptive)
immune responses in the infected mice (Figure 2).
Interestingly, a similar trend in IL-1β, IL-10, IL-17A, and
TNF-α production was observed in all of the infected groups of
mice (i.e., WT S. typhimurium or its �lppAB or �lppAB �msbB
mutants), in which their levels were relatively high on day 1 p.i.,
but subsequently declined by the end of the first week. However, a
resurgence in these cytokine production reaching to their highest
levels was noted on either day 14 or 21 p.i. (Figures 2A,C,D,F).
On the other hand, the trends for IL-6 and IFN-γ production
varied among different groups of mice (Figures 2B,E).
IFN-γ levels gradually mounted during the course of infection
in the WT S. typhimurium-infected group of mice and reached
the peak level on day 14 p.i. (Figure 2E). In contrast, a substantial
level of IFN-γ was only detected on days 14 and 21 p.i. in

FIGURE 2 | Serum cytokine production in mice orally infected with WT and mutants of S. typhimurium. Six-to-eight week old C57BL/6J female mice (10
per group) were challenged with 2.0 × 106 CFU/100 µl of WT S. typhimurium or its �lppAB and �lppAB �msbB mutants via the oral route. The serum cytokine
levels IL-1β (A), IL-6 (B), IL-10 (C), IL-17A (D), IFN-γ (E), and TNF-α (F) were examined on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 p.i. by using a mouse 6-plex assay kit. Data were
analyzed by using Two-way ANOVA with the Tukey’s post-hoc correction. The statistical significances were indicated by a line for the compared groups with the
P-values or by asterisks when compared to either the pre-immune serum on day 1 or the serum from WT S. typhimurium-infected mice for other days. The presented
data were pooled from 4 independent experiments representing 4–8 animals/group.
the �lppAB �msbB mutant-infected group of mice. Strikingly,
minimal IFN-γ was produced in the group of animals infected
with the �lppAB mutant throughout the infection course
(Figure 2E).
Likewise, the level of IL-6 gradually increased during the
course of infection in the WT S. typhimurium-infected group
of mice and reached the highest level on day 14 p.i. However,
the levels of IL-6 in either of the mutant-infected mice increased
somewhat on day 3 p.i. and declined on day 7 p.i., followed by its
increase on days 14 or 21 p.i. (Figure 2B).
When comparing WT S. typhimurium vs. the mutant-infected
mice, the former generally had higher levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10,
and IFN-γ on day 14 p.i. (Figures 2A–C,E). These cytokine levels
significantly dropped to lower than that of both the mutant-
infected groups of mice on day 21 p.i. On the other hand, TNF-
α was maintained at generally a similar level across all of the
infected mice (with WT S. typhimurium or its �lppAB or �lppAB
�msbB mutants), but were elevated to much higher levels in both
of the mutant-infected groups of animals at the later stages of
infection (days 14 and 21, Figure 2F).
Interestingly, the production of IL-17A was generally higher
in the mutant-infected groups of mice; however, the trend was
reversed on day 14 p.i., with significantly higher levels of IL-
17A in the WT S. typhimurium -infected group of animals
(Figure 2D) compared to that of the mutant-infected groups of
mice.
Finally, all of the measured cytokine levels were at the
comparable levels in the �lppAB mutant-infected group of mice
during the first week of infection in comparison to the �lppAB
�msbB mutant-infected group of animals. However, the trend
changed at the later stages of infection (e.g., days 14 and 21 p.i.),
during which time significantly higher levels of cytokines were
observed in the �lppAB �msbB mutant-infected group of mice
(Figure 2).
Protection Conferred by Oral Immunization
of Mice with the �lppAB or the �lppAB
�msbB Mutant against Subsequent WT.
S. typhimurium Challenge
To gauge protection provided by immunization of mice with
the mutant strains compared to that of the WT bacterium,
animals were initially immunized/infected orally with a relatively
low dose (3 × 103 CFU) of the mutant strains (�lppAB and
�lppAB �msbB) or WT S. typhimurium. This low dose ensured
animal survival from WT S. typhimurium infection as its LD50
was calculated to be 2.0 × 105 CFU when administered via
the oral route. The naïve mice received PBS and served as a
control. No animal succumbed to infection during the initial
immunization/infection period in all of the groups. On day
36 post immunization, these mice were orally challenged with
2 × 106 CFU of WT S. typhimurium (Figure 3A). All mice

�msbB mutants via the oral route. Naïve mice received PBS and served as a negative control. Thirty-six days after immunization, mice were orally challenged with 2 ×

group was plotted. Asterisks indicate statistically significant P-value in comparison to the naïve control group and were based on Kaplan–Meier Curve Analysis (0.013)
and Fisher exact test (0.04). (B) Mice (n = 5 per group) were orally immunized with 1 × 108 CFU of �lppAB or the �lppAB �msbB mutant, and after 21 days, the
immunized animals along with unimmunized naïve control mice (n = 5) were challenged with 1 × 108 CFU of WT S. typhimurium via the oral route. Organs were
excised from WT S. typhimurium-challenged unimmunized control mice on day 7 and from the mutant-immunized animals on day 21 post challenge with WT
S. typhimurium. These organs were stained with H&E and evaluated by light microscopy in a blinded fashion. Asterisks indicate focal necrosis and thrombosis. Solid

survived, while 60% of the animals were protected in the WT
S. typhimurium-vaccinated group. Naïve control mice (80%), on
the other hand, succumbed to infection.
In a parallel experiment, mice were orally immunized with
a high dose (1 × 108 CFU) of �lppAB or the �lppAB
�msbB mutant, and no animal succumbed to infection during
immunization. After 21 days, the immunized mice were
challenged with WT S. typhimurium (1 × 108 CFU) via the
oral route and all survived. Mouse organs were excised 21 days
post challenge for histopathological analysis. The high doses used
for both immunization and challenge were to examine safety
of the aforementioned mutants and their protective potential.
The unimmunized naïve mice challenged with 1 × 108 CFU of
WT S. typhimurium via the oral route were used as a positive
control for examining histopathological lesions in organs. These
tissues were examined on day 7 post challenge as animals showed
severe symptoms such as ruffled fur, lethargy, loss in weight,
and diarrhea. As shown in Figure 3B, the WT S. typhimurium-
challenged naïve mice had pyogranulomas in various peripheral
organs, such as the liver and spleen (arrows), and the lungs had
inflammatory cell infiltrate (solid triangle). The splenic tissues
revealed lymphoid depletion in white pulps and leukocytosis. The
depleted cell types were more likely hematopoietic or stromal
cells in the red pulps. In addition, focal necrosis and thrombosis
were observed in liver and spleen tissues (asterisks) of mice
infected with the WT bacterium. However, intestinal tissue
sections, e.g., duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, showed no marked
lesions except for inflammation on day 7 p.i. (data not shown).
While analyzing tissues from both of the mutant-immunized
groups of mice after WT S. typhimurium challenge, the above
observed lesions (e.g., granulomas in the liver, arrows) and focal
necrosis/thrombosis (asterisk) in the spleens were much milder
in nature with largely intact red and white pulps, when compared
to tissues from the WT S. typhimurium-infected naïve mice
(Figure 3B).
T-Cell Responses in Mice Immunized with
the �lppAB or the �lppAB �msbB Mutant
of S. typhimurium
As
shown
in
Figure 4A,
T-cells
from
both
the
mutant-immunized groups of mice significantly proliferated in
response to the stimulation with WT S. typhimurium antigens.
However, the extent of proliferation was much higher for the
�lppAB mutant-vaccinated mice than that of �lppAB �msbB
mutant-immunized animals.
A robust cytokine production was also observed in T-cells
from both the �lppAB and �lppAB �msbB mutant-immunized
mice in response to stimulation with WT S. typhimurium
antigens. At 48 h after stimulation, T-cell production of
TNF-α in the �lppAB-immunized mice was significantly higher
when compared to T-cells from the �lppAB �msbB mutant-
immunized animals (Figure 4B). On the other hand, IFN-γ and
IL-6 production from T-cells in the �lppAB �msbB mutant-
immunized animals (Figures 4C,D) were much higher when
compared to the animals immunized with the �lppAB mutant.
At 72 h after stimulation, T-cell production of IFN-γ
(Figure 4C) and IL-17A (Figure 4E) were much higher in the
�lppAB mutant-immunized mice when compared to that in the
�lppAB �msbB mutant-vaccinated animals. The level of IL-10
was maintained at a similar level in both the mutant- immunized
mice at both time points of 48 and 72 h (Figure 4F).
Compared to the un-pulsed controls, IFN-γ and IL-10
production were at higher levels in T-cells from both of the
mutant infected mice (Figures 4C,F) at both the time points;
however, IL-6 levels were specifically induced in T-cells of
�lppAB �msbB mutant-immunized mice at 48 h time point
(Figure 4D), Likewise, TNF-α was significantly produced only
from the T-cells of �lppAB mutant-immunized mice upon
stimulation with the WT S. typhimurium antigens at a 48 h time
point, but it was significantly dropped at 72 h (Figure 4B). In
contrast, the level of TNF-α in the supernatant of pulsed T-cells
from the �lppAB �msbB mutant-immunized mice was slightly
increased at 72 h time point and reached statistical significance
when compared to the un-pulsed control (Figure 4B).
Alterations in the Protein Profiling of
�lppAB and �lppAB �msbB Mutants in
Comparison to WT S. typhimurium
2D gel electrophoresis and analysis were performed to obtain
protein profiling of WT S. typhimurium and that of its �lppAB
and �lppAB �msbB mutants. There were a total of 1726, 1899,
and 1835 protein spots on the 2D gels for WT bacteria, and its
�lppAB and �lppAB �msbB mutants, respectively. After manual
editing and filtering, a total of 1099 spots correlated across the
gels of different groups of bacteria (e.g., WT S. typhimurium,
�lppAB, and �lppAB �msbB mutants; Table S1). Compared
to the 2D gels for WT S. typhimurium, 22 spots had higher
normalized volumes (NVs) and 47 spots had lower NVs in the
�lppAB mutant (Table S2). These numbers were 46 (higher) and
14 (lower) for the �lppAB �msbB mutant. Likewise, 10 spots
on the 2D gel for the �lppAB mutant and 43 spots for the
�lppAB �msbB mutant had relatively higher NVs when these
two mutants were compared to each other (Table S2).
A total of 61 spots were picked based on their fold changes
and NVs for mass spectrometric analysis. Among these identified
proteins, the majority of them belonged to bacterial inner and
outer membranes such as structural proteins, receptors, and
transporters. In addition, some proteases, metabolic enzymes,
translation associated components, as well as cell signaling
related molecules (synthases and regulatory proteins) were
also observed. Interestingly, the levels of two proteins, outer
membrane protein A (OmpA) and periplasmic protein TolB were
higher in both the �lppAB and �lppAB �msbB mutants when
compared to that in the WT bacterium (Table 1).
In contrast, the level of seven proteins, including a serine
protease, tricarboxylic transport, cAMP-regulatory protein,
arginine-binding periplasmic protein 2 precursor, flagellar-
associated

produced significantly more with respective 8.1–39.4 and 7.4-fold
changes (Table S3), respectively, in the �lppAB �msbB mutant.
On the other hand, protein chain initiation factor 2 and Lon
protease were increased by 7.0 and 4.4-folds, respectively, in the
�lppAB mutant. A complete list of 61 spots with their protein
identification and fold changes are shown in Table S3.
DISCUSSION
Vaccine-based prophylaxis has historically been not only the
most significant advances in the healthcare, but also a cost-
effective means of public health intervention. We generated
S. typhimurium mutants deleted for the lppA and lppB genes
alone or in combination with the msbB gene, and studied their
attenuation and immunogenicity in mice first in a septicemic
mouse model of infection (Sha et al., 2004; Fadl et al., 2005a,b;
Liu et al., 2008), and now by the oral route.
Lpp synergizes with LPS to produce pro-inflammatory
cytokines/chemokines by activating host cells through TLR-2
and TLR-4 signaling, respectively (Ulevitch and Tobias, 1995;
Aliprantis et al., 1999; Tobias et al., 1999). In our previous
studies, we showed that both �lppAB and �lppAB �msbB
mutants indeed triggered much less pro-inflammatory cytokines
compared to the WT bacterium in an intraperitoneal mouse
model of infection during early stages of infection (within a
week; Sha et al., 2004; Fadl et al., 2005a,b; Liu et al., 2008).
However, this phenomenon was not apparent in mice orally
infected with the mutants. For example, IL-17A was detected in
higher levels in both the mutant-infected mice when compared
to WT S. typhimurium-infected animals during early stages of
infection (Figure 2). In addition, a more balanced Th1 and
Th2 antibody responses were observed across all orally infected
mice, irrespective of whether WT or mutants of S. typhimurium
were used (Figures 1B,C). In contrast, IgG1 was the dominant
isotype in all mice infected intraperitoneally, accompanied with
high levels of T-cell IL-4 production from animals infected with
the mutant strains (Liu et al., 2008). These differences may be
attributed to different infection routes, bacterial dosages used,
and, specifically, C57BL/6J mice are biased to mount a Th1
response (Watanabe et al., 2004).
IL-17 is a signature cytokine of Th17 cells, along with IL-21
and IL-22, and the Th17 response protects animals in an

antibody-independent manner (Lin et al., 2011). It has been
reported that IL-17 and its associated cytokines (IL-21 and IL-
22) are induced in the gastrointestinal tract during Salmonella
infection (Ramarathinam et al., 1993; Lee et al., 2012; Kurtz
et al., 2014; McSorley, 2014). While Th1 cells are critical for
activation of infected macrophages to kill Salmonella in the
tissues, Th17 cells are likely essential for recruiting neutrophils to
the site of intestinal infection to engulf bacteria (Ramarathinam
et al., 1993; Tükel et al., 2009; Broz et al., 2012; Lee et al.,
2012). Likewise, fecal IgA, the abundant class of antibodies in
the intestinal secretion, serves as the first line of defense against
infection (Michetti et al., 1992; Mantis et al., 2011; Gutzeit et al.,
2014), and IgA antibodies against a variety of Salmonella antigens
are highly effective in preventing salmonellosis (Michetti et al.,
1992, 1994; Amarasinghe et al., 2013). Although both Th17 and
IgA responses have been shown to provide protection against
Salmonella infection (Martinoli et al., 2007; Ko et al., 2009;
Mayuzumi et al., 2010; Geddes et al., 2011; Keestra et al., 2011),
it is still unclear whether both the �lppAB and �lppAB �msbB
mutant-induced Th17 and IgA responses in mice are directly
linked to their protection against subsequent WT S. typhimurium
challenge.
Nevertheless, the serum levels of IL-17A were not only
generally maintained at higher levels in the mutant-infected mice
when compared to WT bacterium-infected animals at an early
infection stage (e.g., day 1), but were also sustained longer in the
mutant-infected mice at the later infection stages (Figure 2D).
More importantly, these IL-17A levels correlated with more fecal
IgA production on day 21 p.i. in mice infected with the �lppAB
and �lppAB �msbB mutants (Figure 1D). As we demonstrated
recently that Th17 cell production of IL-17 promoted intestinal
IgA responses (Cao et al., 2012), it is very likely that the increased
IL-17 mediated the high fecal IgA response in mice immunized
with the mutants.
In addition to higher IL-17A and fecal IgA production,
increased levels of Salmonella- specific antibodies as well as
other examined serum cytokines, which were generally sustained
for longer periods (up to day 21 p.i.; Figures 1, 2) in mice
orally infected with the mutants, might have contributed to
full protection of immunized mice to WT bacterial challenge.
This protection was 60% in WT S. typhimurium -infected
mice during the subsequent re-challenge with WT bacterium
(Figure 3A). Interestingly, each of the two mutants displayed
some unique immunological aspects. For example, the �lppAB
mutant-infected mice had relatively higher serum cytokines at
the early infection stage (Figure 2), and elicited stronger T-cell
proliferation which was associated with the production of TNF-
α in comparison to animals infected with the �lppAB �msbB
mutant (Figure 4).
On the other hand, the �lppAB �msbB mutant-infected mice
generally displayed higher levels of serum cytokines during the
later stages of infection (Figure 2) and IL-6 production from T-
cells (Figure 4), as well as more fecal IgA production (Figure 1).
However, it is unclear whether all of these differences are related
to the compromised TLR-4 signaling as a result of the msbB
deletion, which needs to be further investigated. Interestingly,
LPS, a sero-dominant and protective antigen in most gram-
negative bacteria, has undergone limited analysis as a human
Salmonella vaccinogen (MacLennan et al., 2010). This is being
re-addressed in new exploratory programs to develop Salmonella
vaccines using LPS from S. enteritidis (Simon et al., 2011) and
S. typhimurium (Simon et al., 2013) as part of efforts to combat
iNTS (Strugnell et al., 2014). Most importantly, a vaccine using
GMMA (generalized modules for membrane antigens) from
msbB and pagP (encoding lipid A palmitoyltransferase) deletion
mutants of S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis with reduced
potential for in vivo reactogenicity showed a slightly higher
stimulatory potential than WT S. typhimurium harboring WT
lipid A (Rossi et al., 2016). Therefore, in this regard, the �lppAB
�msbB mutant with modified LPS may have some advantages
over the �lppAB mutant.
Based on 2D gel analysis (Table 1 and Table S3), the
production of several proteins such as OmpA, OmpX, TolB,
and superoxide dismutase were found to be altered in the
�lppAB and/or �lppAB �msbB mutants compared to WT
S. typhimurium. More specifically, the production of first three
proteins was up-regulated while the production of superoxide
dismutase was down-regulated in the mutants. OmpA binds
to and activates APCs, resulting in protective cytotoxic T-
lymphocyte (CTL) responses in Klebsiella pneumoniae. It also
augments cytokine production (IL-1, -10, and -12) by dendritic
cells (DCs) and their migration across the polarized human
intestinal epithelial cells in E. coli O157:H7 (Jeannin et al., 2000;
Maisnier-Patin et al., 2003; Torres et al., 2006). While OmpX,
also referred to as Ail (attachment-invasion locus), is a major
contributor to serum resistance and complement evasion in
Yersinia pestis (Bartra et al., 2008; Tiner et al., 2015).
Importantly, active immunization with either OmpA or Ail
(OmpX) provided protection to mice and rats against developing
bubonic and/or pneumonic plague (Erova et al., 2013). The
periplasmic protein TolB belongs to the gram-negative bacterial
Tol system which comprises five proteins (TolQ, TolR, TolA,
TolB, and Pal), and are involved in maintaining bacterial outer

membrane stability (Lazzaroni et al., 2002). A study has shown
that Groupers, e.g., Epinephelus awoara, a fish belonging to
the family Serranidae, immunized with the recombinant TolB
of Vibrio alginolyticus generated high antibody responses and
protected the immunized fish from V. alginolyticus infection
(Pang et al., 2015). The superoxide dismutase protects Salmonella
from products of phagocyte NADPH-oxidase and nitric oxide
synthase (De Groote et al., 1997). Consequently, the reduced
production of superoxide dismutase in the �lppAB �msbB
mutant compared to WT S. typhimurium might result in efficient
killing of the mutant by phagocytic cells as we previously
demonstrated (Fadl et al., 2005b), a feature desirable for any
vaccine candidate (Golubeva and Slauch, 2006).
Interestingly, the level of flagellar-associated GTP-binding
protein decreased in both �lppAB and �lppAB �msbB mutant
strains based on our 2D gel analysis (Table 1), which was
in agreement with the reduced transcription level of flagellar
structure protein-encoding genes detected by our previous
microarray analysis (Fadl et al., 2006), thus adding credibility to
our data obtained by both 2D and microarray analyses. Flagellin,
a TLR-5 agonist, has been recognized and used as an adjuvant for
many vaccines (Hayashi et al., 2001; Yin et al., 2013; Gupta et al.,
2014). However, a recent study showed that flagellin was not a
major factor for GMMA-mediated immune stimulation against
salmonellosis (Rossi et al., 2016). Therefore, the immunogenicity
of our mutants either should not be significantly influenced
by the decreased flagellar-associated proteins or can be further
enhanced in conjunction with the flagellin based adjuvants.
In addition, a study with Y. pestis EV �lpxM (msbB) mutant
also revealed pleiotropic effects of LpxM in altering synthesis
of major immunoreactive antigens (Feodorova et al., 2009).
Therefore, it will be interesting to further discern the role of
the altered potential immunogens in triggering better immune
responses by the mutants than the WT S. typhimurium, and
explore the possibility of developing a subunit vaccine(s) against
salmonellosis.
Nevertheless, the two attenuated S. typhimurium mutant
strains, �lppAB and �lppAB �msbB, elicited robust innate
and adapt immune responses in mice as measured by sera
cytokines and specific Salmonella antibody levels, as well as
T cell responses. Thus, both �lppAB and �lppAB �msbB
mutants showed potential as viable vaccine candidates against
S. typhimurium infection. In addition, the immunological
differences observed between these mutants may provide unique
perspective for specific applications. Our future direction will
include studying the potential cross-protection conferred by the
immunization of animals with �lppAB and �lppAB �msbB
mutants of S. typhimurium against other S. enterica serovars (e.g.,
S. enteritidis).
