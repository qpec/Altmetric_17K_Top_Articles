Abstract
Rats selectively bred for high (HCR) and low (LCR) aerobic capacity show a stark divergence in 
wheel running behavior, which may be associated with dopamine (DA) system in the brain. HCR 
possess greater motivation for voluntary running along with greater brain DA activity compared to 
LCR. We recently demonstrated that HCR are not immune to ovariectomy (OVX)-associated 
reductions in spontaneous cage (i.e. locomotor) activity. Whether HCR and LCR rats differ in their 
OVX-mediated voluntary wheel running response is unknown.
PURPOSE—To determine whether HCR are protected from OVX-associated reduction in 
voluntary wheel running.
METHODS—Forty female HCR and LCR rats (age ~27 weeks) had either SHM or OVX 
operations, and given access to a running wheel for 11 weeks. Weekly wheel running distance was 
monitored throughout the intervention. Nucleus accumbens (NAc) was assessed for mRNA 
expression of DA receptors at sacrifice.

 RESULTS—Compared to LCR, HCR ran greater distance and had greater ratio of excitatory/
inhibitory DA mRNA expression (both line main effects, P<0.05). Wheel running distance was 
significantly, positively correlated with the ratio of excitatory/inhibitory DA mRNA expression 
across animals. In both lines, OVX reduced wheel running (P<0.05). Unexpectedly, although HCR 
started with significantly greater voluntary wheel running, they had greater OVX-induced 
reduction in wheel running than LCR such that no differences were found 11 weeks after OVX 
between HCROVX and LCROVX (interaction, P<0.05). This significant reduction in wheel running 
in HCR was associated with an OVX-mediated reduction in the ratio of excitatory/inhibitory DA 
mRNA expression.
CONCLUSION—DA system in the NAc region may play a significant role in motivation to run 
in female rats. Compared to LCR, HCR rats run significantly more, which associates with greater 
ratio of excitatory/inhibitory DA mRNA expression. However, despite greater inherent motivation 
to run and an associated brain DA mRNA expression profile, these HCR rats are not protected 
against OVX-induced reduction in wheel running. The impairment in wheel running in HCR rats 
may be partially explained by their reduced ratio of excitatory/inhibitory DA receptor mRNA 
expression.

1. Introduction
Most Americans fail to meet the U.S. guidelines for physical activity, and postmenopausal 
women exhibit a particularly high prevalence of physical inactivity for a multitude of 
reasons [1]. Menopause-associated reduction in physical activity is associated with an 
increased prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as coronary heart disease and 
stroke [2, 3]. Conversely, walking and exercise regimens can lower the prevalence of CVD-
associated diseases in postmenopausal women [3, 4]. Given the detrimental impact of 
physical inactivity in postmenopausal women, it is imperative to seek a major psychological/
molecular pathway involved in menopause-associated physical inactivity in order to 
attenuate the CVD-related consequences of menopause, a vicious circle driven by both 
menopause [5] and consequent physical inactivity [2, 6].
Rats selectively bred for high (HCR) and low (LCR) capacity running also demonstrate a 
divergence in voluntary wheel running [7], an activity that represents an evolutionarily 
salient behavior. The large variations in motivated running behavior and locomotion between 
lines may be mediated by a unique brain pathway to engage motor behavior [8, 9]. The 
dopamine (DA) system in the mid-brain mesolimbic circuit has been considered a key 
controller for the regulation of motivation [10], reward [11], and motor control [12], that 
significantly contributes to voluntary physical activity. Among the DA circuits, the nucleus 
accumbens (NAc) located in the ventral striatum is a key element in the cognitive and 
affective processing of voluntary motor actions [13]. DA activation in the NAc plays a 
critical role in behaviors associated with natural re-enforcers, i.e. voluntary running [14–16]. 
The role of the DA system in motivating physical activity can be implied from addiction 
studies [17], in that the DA system serves as a mediator of the incentive or appetitive

 properties of rewarding events, such as voluntary running. Roberts and Booth [18] proposed 
the possibility of an inherent difference in DA-related transcriptomes in the NAc between 
rats selectively bred for high and low voluntary wheel running, a different type of selective 
breeding than what was used for the HCR/LCR rats. Despite differences in how selective 
breeding was performed, the data from Roberts and Booth suggest that higher levels of DA-
transcriptomes may also be a mechanism for higher voluntary wheel running in the HCR 
rats. This argument is supported by previous research demonstrating that highly active mice 
express greater DA activation in the mesolimbic circuit compared to control mice [7, 19]. 
While the role of the DA system in the NAc in mediating the rewarding nature of voluntary 
running has been documented, it is also unknown if elevating excitatory and decreasing 
inhibitory DA mRNA expression (i.e., HCR rats) protects against OVX-induced reduction in 
voluntary wheel running and/or locomotion.
Ovarian hormones including estrogen (E2) appear to exert a tonic stimulation for DA 
receptors, and chronic stimulation may help maintain DA activation in rodents [13]. Loss of 
ovarian hormones in OVX rodents, a model of human menopause, reduces wheel running 
and locomotor activity via attenuated DA receptor expression and DA release at synaptic 
clefts in the NAc [20, 21]. Recently, our group demonstrated that, while female HCR had 
~30% greater spontaneous physical activity (i.e., locomotor activity) than LCR, both HCR 
and LCR experienced ~20% reduction in physical activity following OVX [22]. As that 
study employed no wheel running system, we were unable to determine whether OVX in 
HCR and LCR rats might also alter the re-enforcing nature of physical activity (i.e., 
voluntary wheel running). The purpose of the present study was to determine 1) if HCR are 
protected against OVX-associated reduction in voluntary wheel running activity compared to 
LCR; 2) whether this protection in HCR is associated with preservation of greater excitatory 
and/or less inhibitory DA mRNA expression in the NAc.
2. Material and methods
2.1 Animal protocol
Using the different levels of performance on 3-grade treadmill exercise tests, we have 
developed two strains of rats having different intrinsic endurance exercise capacities 
determined by maximal running distance to exhaustion. We have selectively bred the rats for 
high (i.e. HCR) and low (i.e. LCR) endurance running capacities over many generations, and 
finally HCR had ~30% greater intrinsic aerobic capacities compared to LCR rats [23]. Forty 
female HCR and LCR rats (generation 33) were shipped to the University of Missouri, and 
singly housed under standard temperature and humidity on a 12h-12h light/dark cycle. Rats 
were fed with water and standard rodent chow (Harlan Teklad Rodent Diet 8604) ad libitum. 
Animal procedures were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 
(IACUC) at the University of Missouri-Columbia prior to their initiation.
2.2 Experimental design
The HCR and LCR rats were randomized to four groups: HCRSHM, HCROVX, LCRSHM, 
and LCROVX. When the rats were approximately 27 weeks old, sham (SHM) or ovariectomy 
(OVX) operations were conducted. Following a one-week recovery period, all rats were

 given access to voluntary wheel running in their cages, and fed standard rodent chow 
(Harlan Teklad Rodent Diet 8604) and water ad libitum for 11 weeks. Voluntary wheel 
running distance was monitored weekly. Wheels were locked 3–5 hours prior to sacrifice, to 
prevent any acute exercise effect. On the day of sacrifice, rats were anesthetized with 
pentobarbital sodium (100mg/kg; Nembutal Sodium Solution; Akorn, Lake Forest, IL). 
Immediately after rapid decapitation via guillotine, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was 
collected and frozen for further analyses.
2.3 Ovariectomy and sham surgeries
OVX and SHM surgeries were performed as previously described [24]. Briefly, rats were 
anesthetized with inhaled isofluorane and kept at 2% during surgery. A one-inch incision at 
midline of the dorsal surface was made, followed by bilateral incisions through the muscle 
layer to expose the ovaries. After removing the ovaries, the skin incision was closed using 
wound clips, and rats received acetaminophen (500 mg/kg).
2.4 Brain tissue collection
For mRNA assessment, NAc was collected via a protocol adapted from Mathes et al. [25]. 
Whole brains were removed and rinsed in saline solution, and then placed posterior side up 
in an acrylic sectioning apparatus (Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA). A 2.0 mm coronal 
slice of each brain was made between Bregma 0.7 and 2.7 mm. Slices were positioned on an 
ice-cooled plate, and in turn bilateral punches (2.00 mm diameter) were made for the NAc 
regions. Tissues were stored at −80°C until analysis.
2.5 Voluntary wheel running system
Use of the wheel running system is well established to study rodent voluntary activity [26]. 
Each cage was equipped with a running wheel (11cm wide with an inner diameter of 35cm). 
An electronic bicycle computer monitoring system (Sigma Sport BC 800 bicycle computer, 
Cherry Creek Cyclery, Foster Fall, VA) was connected to the wheel system to quantify the 
number of revolutions; revolutions were then converted to distance in kilometers.
2.6 Assessment of NAc gene expression
Total mRNA was extracted from NAc tissue from bilateral punches in order to assess gene 
expression via real-time quantitative PCR (rtPCR). The following mRNAs were measured to 
assess the DA system: the D1-like DA receptors (excitatory; Drd1 and 5), the D2-like DA 
receptors (inhibitory; Drd 2, 3, and 4), and dopamine transporter (DAT), and 18S 
(housekeeping gene). The NAc tissue was thawed on ice, and tissue lysis was conducted by 
a high-speed shaking apparatus (Tissuelyser LT, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and Trizol method 
via manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was reverse transcribed from total RNA using the 
High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Our 
RNA extraction method was previously validated for optimal quality assurance (i.e., through 
RNA quality number (RQN) determination); all RQN values were >8.0 [27]. rtPCR was 
performed using the ABI StepOne Plus sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) 
and the iTaq UniverSYBR Green SMX (BioRad, Hercules, CA), as previously described 
[28]. Primer sequences were designed using the NCBI Primer Design tool and obtained from 
Park et al.

 IDT (Coralville, IA). 18S was used to amplify the endogenous control product, and mRNA 
expression values are expressed as 2ΔCT (ΔCT = HK CT − gene of interest CT); gene 
expression data were expressed relative to the HCRSHM group, which was set to 1.0. The 
total activation of DA system was estimated by the ratio of the average of D1-like DA 
receptor gene expressions (i.e. Drd1 and 5) to the average of D2-like DA receptor gene 
expressions (i.e. Drd 2, 3, and 4).
2.7 Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Two-way analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) was used to determine statistical differences for line main effects (HCR 
vs. LCR), treatment main effects (SHM vs. OVX), and line × treatment interactions. For 
wheel running distance changes over time, two-way ANOVA with repeated measures was 
used. Bivariate Spearman’s correlations were performed to determine the association 
between the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory DA receptor mRNA expression and total 
running distance (accumulated running distance for 11 weeks) in HCR and LCR rats. In all 
cases, P<0.05 was considered statistically different and data are reported as mean ± SE.
3. Results
3.1 Wheel running assessment
Weekly running distance throughout the 11-week period is depicted in Figure 1A. When 
averaged over the intervention period, wheel running distance was greater in HCR than LCR 
and OVX reduced it in both lines compared to SHM group (treatment and line main effect, 
F=111 and F=83, respectively, P<0.001 for both main effects; Figure 1B). When investigated 
as early (i.e., week 1) and late (i.e., week 11) time points, HCR ran greater distance than 
LCR at both points (line main effect, F=49.6 and F=40.6 for week1 and week11, 
respectively, P<0.001 for both time points; Figure 1C), and OVX reduced weekly wheel 
running distance in both lines at both points compared to SHM group (treatment main effect, 
F=9.7 and F=56.3, P=0.004 and P<0.001 for week1 and week11, respectively). However, 
following 11 weeks, HCR had greater OVX-induced reduction in weekly wheel running 
distance than LCR (time × treatment; time × line interactions, F=3.8 and F=2.5, P=0.001 and 
P=0.042, respectively; Figure 1C). Interestingly, although the increase in running over time 
was significantly lower in LCROVX compared to LCRSHM, it is important to note that 
LCROVX did continue to increase their weekly wheel running from week 1 to week 11. This 
was in stark contrast to the HCROVX group, who decreased running activity throughout the 
intervention (P<0.001), an effect not observed in any other group.
3.2 Dopaminergic gene expression in NAc
Overall HCR had greater excitatory dopamine (i.e., Drd1) mRNA expression compared to 
LCR (line main effect, F=10.9, P=0.003; Figure 2A). On the other hand, genes associated 
with inhibitory dopamine (i.e., Drd3 and Drd4) were expressed relatively greater in LCR 
than HCR rats (line main effect, F=32.2 and F=3.6, P<0.001 and P=0.05 for Drd3 and Drd4, 
respectively; Figure 2A). OVX differentially affected HCR and LCR rats such that OVX 
increased inhibitory (i.e., Drd2 and Drd4) mRNA expression in HCR, and reduced those 
markers in LCR (line × treatment interaction, F=18.9 and F=11.0, P=0.001 and 0.003 for 
Park et al.

 Drd2 and Drd4, respectively; Figure 2A). No significant difference was found between line 
and treatment in Drd5 and DAT mRNA expression. The estimated marker of DA activation, 
assessed by the ratio of excitatory DA receptor to inhibitory DA receptor gene expressions, 
was greater in HCR than LCR (line main effect, F=15.7, P<0.001), but OVX only affected 
this ratio in HCR (line × treatment interaction, F=4.7, P=0.037; Figure 2B). Moreover, this 
ratio was positively correlated with weekly running distance across animals (r=0.55, F=167, 
P<0.001, Figure 2C). This significant correlation across all animals was primarily attributed 
to the significant correlation in HCR rats (r=0.43, F=52, P<0.05; Figure 2D) whereas the 
correlation was not significant in LCR rats alone (r= −0.004, F=−0.245, P=0.49; Figure 2E). 
However, the correlation was strengthened with the addition of the LCR rats, suggesting that 
the relationship exists in both lines.
4. Discussion
It is well established that loss of ovarian hormones (e.g., rodent ovariectomy (OVX) and 
human menopause) reduces spontaneous physical activity [22, 29, 30]; yet, whether female 
hormone loss affects motivated physical activity (e.g. wheel running in rodents or structured 
exercise in humans) is not known. It is also known that physiological and psychological 
drives for physical activity are mediated via brain dopamine (DA) system [14–16]; which 
may cause the HCR rats to be physically active [18]. Yet, if elevating DA receptor 
expression (i.e., HCR rats) protects against OVX-induced reduction in voluntary wheel 
running is uncertain. The major findings of the present study were as follows. First, similar 
to our previous findings that OVX reduced spontaneous physical activity in both HCR and 
LCR rats [22], both lines experienced an OVX-mediated reduction in voluntary wheel 
running (i.e., motivated running behavior) compared to their SHM counterparts. 
Interestingly, HCROVX was the only group that did not escalate weekly wheel running from 
week 1 to week 11, while LCROVX showed attenuated increase of wheel running over time 
compared to LCRSHM. Second, HCR rats also appeared susceptible to an OVX-mediated 
reduction in the ratio of excitatory/inhibitory DA receptor mRNA expression while the ratio 
was unchanged in LCR rats following OVX. Strikingly, this change in DA receptor mRNA 
expression in HCR rats was associated with a significant reduction in wheel running from 
week 1 to week 11. Finally, compared to LCR rats, HCR did have a significantly greater 
ratio of excitatory/inhibitory DA receptor mRNA expression compared to LCR rats; and that 
ratio correlated significantly in the positive direction with voluntary wheel running across 
animals. That relationship was driven largely by the HCR line, as the correlation was not 
significant in LCR rats alone (Figure 2C–E).
Approximately 60% of all women fail to meet the U.S. guidelines of physical activity [1]. 
Moreover, women over age 60 are a particularly concerning cohort regarding physical 
inactivity; indeed, a strong, inverse association between physical activity level and mortality 
has been reported in postmenopausal women [1]. The reason why this group is particularly 
susceptible to physical inactivity is not well understood, but there is a strong association 
between loss of ovarian hormones and reduced physical activity [30]. Using OVX rodent 
models, previous research has demonstrated that lack of ovarian hormones per se causes a 
reduction in spontaneous physical activity (i.e. locomotor activity) [21], and decreases 
voluntary running activity [20, 31, 32]. We previously showed that both HCR and LCR rats

 experienced a ~20% reduction in spontaneous physical activity following OVX, but 
HCROVX still had enhanced SPA levels compared to LCROVX [22]. Rodent wheel running is 
an accepted model of voluntary, motivated activity, and has also been used to study the brain 
reward mechanism associated with voluntary activity [26]. The present study showed that 
OVX reduced voluntary wheel running in both HCR and LCR rats. In week 1, HCR 
appeared to be somewhat protected from an OVX-induced reduction in wheel running, such 
that OVX reduced wheel running distance more in LCR (HCROVX: −45% compared to 
HCRSHM; LCROVX: −65% compared to LCRSHM; Figure 1C), and HCROVX still ran more 
than 10-fold greater in wheel running distance compared to LCROVX. However, only the 
HCROVX group gradually decreased their wheel running over time so that, by week 11, 
HCROVX and LCROVX groups ran a similar weekly running distance (Figure 1A and C), and 
OVX-induced reduction in wheel running distance was greater in HCR than LCR (HCR: 
−75% compared to HCRSHM; LCR: −65% compared to LCRSHM; a significant interaction, 
P<0.005; Figure 1C). These data suggest that HCR are more susceptible to OVX-associated 
attenuation in wheel running than LCR on a longer-term basis (i.e., following 11 weeks). 
This may be explained by the fact that HCR started with greater wheel running distance than 
LCR, thus they had more distance to decline. On the other hand, LCR started at an already 
very low activity level with almost no room to decline.
Knab and Lightfoot [16] stated that DA system in the NAc is a major controller of voluntary 
running. Other research has implicated the mesolimbic DA circuits in the regulation of 
motivation [10], reward [11], and motor control [12], all of which may contribute to 
voluntary activity. Among the DA circuits, NAc located in the ventral striatum is a key 
element in the cognitive and affective processing of voluntary motor actions [13]. The DA 
neurons in the striatum appears to be responsible for control of motor activity [33], while 
DA activity in the NAc plays a critical role in behaviors associated with natural re-enforcers, 
e.g. sexual behavior, food consumption, incentive learning, or voluntary running [14, 15, 
34]. The role of the DA system in motivating physical activity can be implied from addiction 
studies [17, 35], in that the DA system may mediate the incentive and reward properties that 
motivate an animal to perform additional physical activity. A most salient finding of the 
present study is that wheel running distance was positively correlated with the ratio of 
excitatory/inhibitory DA receptor mRNA expression, measured by the ratio of excitatory to 
inhibitory receptors across animals, suggestive of the significant role of DA system in wheel 
running. No studies have previously showed the importance of DA system in regulating 
motivated wheel running activity using the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory receptor gene 
expression as a marker of estimated DA activation. Our finding is partially congruent with a 
previous animal study [36] demonstrating that DA knock-out rodents have reduced 
motivation for high-effort tasks. Moreover, using a DA receptor-specific agonist, De Vries et 
al. [37] demonstrated the importance of the DA system in regulating physical activity by 
injecting a Drd1 (i.e., excitatory) receptor agonist into the NAc and showing a resultant 
enhancement in physical activity. Baldo et al. [38] further confirmed this finding, showing 
that injecting a Drd1 receptor antagonist reduces physical activity. Thus, it is evident that 
brain DA system dictates physical activity behavior in rodents. For the first time, the present 
study demonstrates that excitatory DA receptor gene expression (i.e., Drd1) gene expression 
was greater in HCR (well characterized as having intrinsically high levels of both

 spontaneous and wheel running activities) compared to LCR rats (characterized as having 
the counter phenotype – lower spontaneous and wheel running activities). Similarly, we 
found that inhibitory DA receptor gene expression (i.e., Drd3 and Drd4) were lower in HCR.
We tested the hypothesis that HCR rats would be protected against OVX-induced reduction 
in wheel running compared to LCR due to greater baseline DA activation (i.e. increased 
excitatory and decreased inhibitory DA receptors) in the NAc. We did show that HCRSHM 
exemplified significantly greater voluntary wheel running than LCRSHM rats, and that this 
enhancement was paralleled by a similar enhancement in the ratio of excitatory/inhibitory 
DA receptor mRNA expression. Yet, an unexpected finding was that HCROVX was the only 
group that did not increase weekly wheel running from week 1 to week 11. It has been 
shown that HCR have more than 5-fold greater voluntary running distance compared to LCR 
rats [9], and Booth’s group [18] previously proposed the possibility that rats selectively bred 
for high voluntary running are more physically active owing to their enhanced DA-
associated transcriptomes in the NAc. Previous studies with mice also demonstrated that 
highly active mice express greater DA activation in the mesolimbic circuit compared to 
control mice [7, 19]. However, we found that, despite greater ratio of excitatory/inhibitory 
DA receptor mRNA expression, HCR were not protected against OVX-mediated reduction 
in wheel running. Specifically, HCROVX decreased wheel running from week 1 to week 11 
while LCROVX increased running over time. This differential response to OVX was 
paralleled by a unique interaction response in two of the DA inhibitory receptors, notably, 
Drd 2 (Figure 2A) such that OVX increased gene expression in HCR and decreased it in 
LCR compared to their SHM counterparts. The reason for this interesting interaction is not 
clear. However, it has been demonstrated in rats that OVX significantly increases Drd 2 
receptor density and DA binding in the NAc brain region, which is normalized with estrogen 
replacement [39]; indeed other reports show that estrogen decreases Drd 2 receptor density 
in the NAc [40]. Thus, the effect we observed in the LCR rat following OVX appears to be 
the atypical response. Similar to that study by Chavez et al. [39], we did not observe any 
changes in Drd 1 expression following OVX; thus, our data support their hypothesis that 
changes in DA receptor levels following OVX are specific to Drd 2. However, it is important 
to re-acknowledge here that our data were mRNA only, whereas Chavez et al. measured 
receptor levels and binding affinities. Thus, more studies are clearly necessary to investigate 
the mechanism and implications of this differential response to OVX in Drd 2 expression 
between HCR and LCR rats. As an exploratory analysis, we expressed the mRNA levels of 
excitatory and inhibitory DA receptors as a ratio and compared the groups. Although the 
meaningfulness of this measure is not completely clear given that it only accounts for 
differences in relative gene expression, it is interesting to note that only HCR rats 
experienced a ~30% reduction in the excitatory/inhibitory ratio following OVX, which was 
significantly associated with their reduction in wheel running over time. Thus, although not 
conventional, we felt compelled to present the data that way given the significant correlation 
with running behavior.
It is unclear why OVX reduces wheel running in HCR rats despite their intrinsically 
enhanced DA receptor mRNA expression, but it may be partially attributed to a strong effect 
of ovarian hormones on mediating DA activation and physical activity, independent of 
intrinsic aerobic capacity level. We also recently demonstrated a strong impact of ovarian

 hormones on metabolic function (i.e., tissue-specific insulin sensitivity) independent of 
intrinsic aerobic capacity level [41]. Among ovarian hormones, circulating E2 is the critical 
mediator of physical activity in female animals. One study suggests estrogenic modulation 
of neurotransmitters including DA in mid-brain [42]. E2 appears to exert a tonic stimulation 
for striatal DA receptors, and chronic stimulations may help maintain DA activity in rodents. 
Whereas this stimulation is lost following OVX, E2 replacement immediately after OVX can 
preserve the upregulated D1-like (excitatory) DA receptors [43, 44]. The estrogenic pathway 
can also control DA functioning in different steps such as DA release and metabolism at the 
pre- and post- synaptic receptors [45]. Nearly all areas of the brain present DA receptor 
expression, while greater expression of the receptors were found in mesolimbic/nigrostriatal 
circuits [46]. In summary, ovarian hormones including E2 likely play a critical role in 
mediating motivation to physical activity via activation of DA system. Loss of E2 by OVX 
may decrease motivated physical activity through an attenuation of DA activation 
independent of intrinsic physical activity level, but likely involves other factors related to 
ovarian hormone loss. Future studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms 
by which HCROVX was the only group that did not increase weekly wheel running from 
week 1 to week 11, and also showed reduced ratio of excitatory/inhibitory DA receptor 
mRNA expression compared to HCRSHM.
The findings of the present study should be considered along with its limitations. First, we 
used the gene expression ratio of excitatory to inhibitory DA receptors as an estimate of DA 
activation. This ratio may not represent the actual DA activation, and some studies reported 
the importance of the binding state or affinity of receptors to DA rather than the quantitative 
presence of DA receptors [47, 48]. Nonetheless, studies still argue the importance of altered 
gene transcription for specific DA receptors, to investigate reward and motivation for 
physical activity [18, 49]. Future studies should employ more substantive methods (e.g., 
immunohistology, protein analyses, binding affinity assays) to validate the gene expression 
data described herein. Yet, the fact that our gene expression analyses correlate so strongly 
with the physiological/behavioral data may argue for the validity of these measures. The 
second limitation is that the HCR/LCR model provides two extreme conditions with 
contrasting running capacity, and it may be argued that a true control is lacking. However, 
we felt that this model served as a good means to initially address the question of whether 
aerobic fitness affects voluntary running behavior following loss of ovarian hormones. 
Future studies will assess how exercise training affects this response to OVX in terms of 
running behavior and brain changes. Similarly, we did not have true sedentary controls (e.g. 
a wheel-locked control). Because our question was about the role of fitness in protecting 
against OVX-related reductions in voluntary behavior, we providing all groups with running 
wheels to control for differences in running behavior over time under ovary-intact 
conditions. Future studies should measure brain changes following OVX versus SHM in 
HCR versus LCR rats also under sedentary conditions. Certainly, more mechanistic studies 
are required to determine causal relationships between OVX-mediated changes in brain 
dopamine signaling and/or behavior.

 4. Conclusions
Despite having a greater ratio of excitatory/inhibitory DA receptor mRNA expression in the 
NAc brain region compared to low-fit LCR rats, high-fit HCR rats were not protected 
against an OVX-induced reduction in voluntary wheel running. Remarkably, this reduction 
in wheel running following OVX, observed especially in HCR rats, correlated significantly 
with a reduction in the ratio of excitatory/inhibitory DA receptor mRNA expression in the 
NAc. Indeed, average wheel running distance throughout the intervention correlated 
positively and significantly with that excitatory/inhibitory ratio across all animals. In 
conclusion, NAc brain region DA receptor gene expression is affected by OVX and may 
result in reduced motivated physical activity in female rats. Thus, activation of DA receptors 
may serve as a future therapeutic target to enhance motivation for physical activity in 
postmenopausal women.

 Highlights
•
High capacity running (HCR) rats have greater net positive dopamine 
(DA) receptor gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) brain 
region compared to low capacity running (LCR) rats.
•
NAc DA receptor gene expression significantly correlates with 
voluntary wheel running.
•
Ovariectomy (OVX) reduces voluntary wheel running independent of 
intrinsic running capacity.
•
Compared to LCR, HCR rats experience greater OVX-induced 
reduction in wheel running which associates with a greater reduction in 
net positive DA receptor gene expression.
