abstract
OBJECTIVES: Examine fatal and nonfatal firearm injuries among children aged 0 to 17 in the 
United States, including intent, demographic characteristics, trends, state-level patterns, 
and circumstances.
METHODS: Fatal injuries were examined by using data from the National Vital Statistics 
System and nonfatal injuries by using data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance 
System. Trends from 2002 to 2014 were tested using joinpoint regression analyses. Incident 
characteristics and circumstances were examined by using data from the National Violent 
Death Reporting System.
RESULTS: Nearly 1300 children die and 5790 are treated for gunshot wounds each year. Boys, 
older children, and minorities are disproportionately affected. Although unintentional 
firearm deaths among children declined from 2002 to 2014 and firearm homicides declined 
from 2007 to 2014, firearm suicides decreased between 2002 and 2007 and then showed 
a significant upward trend from 2007 to 2014. Rates of firearm homicide among children 
are higher in many Southern states and parts of the Midwest relative to other parts of the 
country. Firearm suicides are more dispersed across the United States with some of the 
highest rates occurring in Western states. Firearm homicides of younger children often 
occurred in multivictim events and involved intimate partner or family conflict; older 
children more often died in the context of crime and violence. Firearm suicides were often 
precipitated by situational and relationship problems. The shooter playing with a gun was 
the most common circumstance surrounding unintentional firearm deaths of both younger 
and older children.
CONCLUSIONS: Firearm injuries are an important public health problem, contributing 
substantially to premature death and disability of children. Understanding their nature and 
impact is a first step toward prevention.

Recent evidence from the National 
Survey of Children’s Exposure to 
Violence indicates that 4.2% of 
children aged 0 to 17 in the United 
States have witnessed a shooting in 
the past year.1 Children across the 
United States also directly experience 
the fatal and nonfatal consequences 
of firearm violence. Firearm-related 
deaths are the third leading cause 
of death overall among US children 
aged 1 to 17 years, surpassing the 
number of deaths from pediatric 
congenital anomalies, heart disease, 
influenza and/or pneumonia, chronic 
lower respiratory disease, and 
cerebrovascular causes.2 They are 
the second leading cause of injury-
related death in this age group, 
surpassed only by motor vehicle 
injury deaths.2
Previous studies of firearm injuries 
among children have examined 
selected outcomes (eg, deaths, 
hospitalizations, or emergency 
department [ED] visits for nonfatal 
firearm injuries)‍3

of firearm injuries (eg, homicides 
and assaults, unintentional firearm 
injuries)‍.8

10 This article provides the 
most comprehensive examination 
of current firearm-related deaths 
and injuries among children in the 
United States to date. It examines 
overall patterns of firearm-related 
death and injury, patterns by type of 
firearm injury (interpersonal, self-
directed, and unintentional)‍, trends 
over time, state-level patterns, and 
circumstances surrounding these 
deaths. The findings underscore the 
need for scientifically sound solutions 
to address this important public 
health problem.
MeThODs
A firearm injury is defined as a 
gunshot wound or penetrating injury 
from a weapon that uses a powder 
charge to fire a projectile. This 
definition includes gunshot injuries 
sustained from handguns, rifles, 
and shotguns but excludes gunshot 
wounds from air- and gas-powered 
guns, BB guns, and pellet guns, as 
well as nonpenetrating injuries 
associated with firearms (eg, “pistol 
whipping”)‍.
New data were not collected for 
these analyses. National data on 
fatal firearm injuries were derived 
from death certificate data from 
the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention’s (CDC)‍ National 
Vital Statistics System, and were 
obtained via the CDC’s Web-based 
Injury Statistics Query and Reporting 
System.2 Firearm deaths were 
defined by using one of the following 
underlying cause of death codes 
from the International Classification 
of Diseases, 10th Revision: W32-W43 
(unintentional firearm deaths)‍, 
X72-X74 (firearm suicides)‍, X93-
X95 (firearm homicides)‍, Y22-
Y24 and U01.4 (firearm deaths 
of undetermined intent)‍, and 
Y35.0 (legal intervention deaths 
by firearm)‍. Firearm deaths were 
examined for children aged 0 to 17 
years by known intent (homicide, 
suicide, unintentional)‍, race and 
ethnicity, and state. State-level data 
include deaths of state residents only 
and exclude deaths of nonresidents, 
even if the fatal injury occurred 
within the state in question. Firearm 
suicides are reported for children 
aged 10 years and older given how 
rare they are in children younger 
than age 10 (ie, 5 cases for the nation 
over the period 2000–2014)‍2 and 
because children <10 years old may 
not be developmentally capable of 
fully forming suicidal intent. Given 
potential differences in exposures 
for younger children (0–12 years)‍ 
compared with older children (13–17 
years)‍, the data were stratified by age 
group where possible.
Data on nonfatal firearm injuries 
are from the National Electronic 
Injury Surveillance System (NEISS)‍ 
operated by the US Consumer 
Product Safety Commission.11 NEISS 
is a stratified probability sample of 
US hospitals that have an ED and a 
minimum of 6 beds, representing 
large urban, suburban, rural, and 
children’s hospitals. Nonfatal injury 
estimates have been adjusted to 
account for hospital nonresponse and 
changes in the number of US hospital 
EDs over time. NEISS classifies injury 
intent by using standard definitions 
for the following categories: assault, 
self-harm, unintentional, and legal 
intervention. Self-harm data are 
reported only for children aged 
10 years and older (see previous 
note)‍. Information on nonfatal 
injury by racial and ethnic group 
is not presented here because of 
large amounts of missing race and 
ethnicity data.12 NEISS data are 
collected on the basis of a national 
probability sample and sample 
weights are summed to provide 
national estimates; valid regional- 
and state-level estimates cannot be 
obtained from these data.
Data on circumstances and other 
incident characteristics for firearm 
homicide, firearm suicide, and 
unintentional firearm deaths among 
children were derived from the 
National Violent Death Reporting 
System (NVDRS)‍. NVDRS is an 
active, state-based surveillance 
system started in 2003 that collects 
information on all violent deaths and 
unintentional firearm deaths within 
participating states from 3 primary 
sources: death certificates, coroner 
and/or medical examiner records, 
and law enforcement reports. NVDRS 
collects detailed information about 
the context and circumstances of 
these deaths, including victim and 
perpetrator characteristics. This 
analysis includes data from 2003 
to 2013 for the 17 NVDRS states 
funded during this time period (AK, 
CO, GA, KY, MA, MD, NJ, NM, NC, 
OH, OK, OR, RI, SC, UT, VA, and WI)‍. 
States joined the NVDRS system 
in different years13; data for each 
state were included for all available 
years. Pearson χ2 tests were used 
to test the statistical significance of 
differences in NVDRS circumstance

counts between younger (aged 0–12 
years)‍ and older (aged 13–17 years)‍ 
children for firearm homicide and 
unintentional firearm deaths.
Crude rates per 100 000 children 
were calculated by using US Census 
bridged-race population estimates. 
To derive the average annual number 
of nonfatal firearm injuries, national 
estimates for each year from 2012 
to 2014 were summed and divided 
by 3. Similar calculations were 
made to derive the average annual 
number of firearm deaths by using 
unweighted data and annualized 
mortality rates. Additional years of 
data (2010–2014)‍ were used for 
the state maps to provide stable 
estimates at the state level. SAS and 
joinpoint regression analyses were 
used to test the significance of trends 
across the period from 2002 to 
2014. Annual percent change (APC)‍ 
estimates that were statistically 
significant at P < .05 are presented to 
indicate the magnitude and direction 
of significant trends in firearm death 
rates.
ResulTs
The extent of Firearm Injuries and 
Deaths among children in the united 
states
On average, from 2012 to 2014, 
nearly 1300 children (N = 1297)‍ 
died each year in the United States 
from a firearm-related injury, for an 
annual crude rate of 1.8 per 100 000 
(Table 1)‍. Fifty-three percent of 
these were homicides (n = 693)‍, 38% 
were suicides (n = 493)‍, and 6%  
were unintentional firearm deaths  
(n = 82)‍; the remaining 3% were due  
to legal intervention (n = 9)‍ and deaths 
of undetermined intent (n = 19)‍.  
The annual rates of firearm 
homicide (2.6 per 100 000)‍ and 
firearm suicide (2.3 per 100 000)‍ 
were roughly equivalent among the 
older age group (aged 13–17 years)‍ 
and were 15 to 17 times higher than 
the unintentional firearm death rate 
for this group. For the younger group 
(aged 0–12 years)‍, the annual rate of 
firearm homicide (0.3 per 100 000)‍ 
was over 3 times higher than the rate 
of unintentional firearm deaths. As 
noted previously, suicide rates were 
calculated only for children aged 
10 years and older; therefore, they 
cannot be directly compared. During 
the same period, an average of 5790 
children each year received medical 
treatment in an ED for a firearm-
related assault, an act of self-harm, or 
from an unintentional firearm injury, 
for an average annual rate of 7.9 per 
100 000 (Table 1)‍.

National Vital Statistics System (fatal firearm injuries), NEISS (nonfatal injuries). All estimated injuries reported represent annualized (average) numbers; hence, they may not sum to 
total because of rounding.
a Rates are considered unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or fewer cases (for the 3 years 2012–2014). Unreliable rates are suppressed.
b In addition to the firearm-related deaths classified as homicide, suicide, and unintentional, the count for all firearm-related deaths includes those deaths classified as undetermined 
and legal intervention.
c Rates per 100 000 for firearm suicide deaths are calculated by using population estimates for persons 10 years of age and older. Suicide deaths in the 0 to 12-year-old age group therefore 
reflect only decedents aged 10 years and older. N = 2 children under the age of 10 who died by firearm suicide across all years represented.
d All race/ethnicity groups are non-Hispanic other than 'Hispanic, 
' which includes persons of any race with Hispanic ethnicity indicated.
e In addition to the nonfatal firearm injuries classified as assault, self-harm, and unintentional, the count for all nonfatal firearm injuries includes those injuries classified as undetermined 
and legal intervention.

Firearm injuries have among the 
highest case fatality rates of most 
illnesses or injuries. The case fatality 
rate (ie, the proportion of cases 
resulting in death)‍, however, varies 
by intent. From 2012 to 2014, the 
average annual case fatality rate was 
74% for firearm-related self-harm, 
14% for firearm-related assaults, and 
6% for unintentional firearm injuries.
Which children are Most at Risk for 
a Firearm-Related Injury?
Boys disproportionately bear 
the burden of firearm mortality, 
accounting for 82% of all child 
firearm deaths. The annual rate of 
firearm death for boys from 2012 to 
2014 was 4.5 times higher than the 
annual rate for girls (2.8 vs 0.6 per 
100 000)‍ (Table 1)‍; this difference 
was even more pronounced by age, 
with the rate for 13- to 17-year-old 
boys being 6 times higher than the 
rate for same-aged girls (8.6 vs 1.4 
per 100 000; data not shown)‍. During 
this period, the annual rate ratio of 
the boy versus girl firearm homicide 
rate was ∼4:1, for firearm suicide 
it was ∼6:1, and for unintentional 
firearm deaths it was 4.5:1.
Older children (aged 13–17 years)‍ 
had a rate of fatal firearm injury 
that was more than 12 times higher 
than the rate for younger children 
(aged 0–12 years)‍: 5.1 per 100 000 
vs 0.4 (Table 1)‍. The magnitude 
of differences between older and 
younger children varies by intent. 
The annual rate of firearm homicide 
was ∼10 times higher among 13- to 
17-year-olds versus 0 to 12-year-
olds (2.6 vs 0.3 per 100 000)‍; 
unintentional firearm death rates 
were approximately twice as high 
when comparing these 2 groups (0.2 
vs 0.1 per 100 000)‍. Firearm suicide 
rates were ∼11 times higher among 
13- to 17-year-olds (2.3 per 100 000)‍ 
versus 10- to 12-year-olds (0.2 per 
100 000)‍.
African American children have the 
highest rates of firearm mortality 
overall (4.1 per 100 000)‍, and this 
disparity is largely a function of 
differences between racial and ethnic 
groups in firearm homicide. From 
2012 to 2014, the annual firearm 
homicide rate for African American 
children (3.5 per 100 000)‍ was 
nearly twice as high as the rate for 
American Indian children (2.2 per 
100 000)‍, 4 times higher than the 
rate for Hispanic children (0.8 per 
100 000)‍, and ∼10 times higher than 
the rate for white children and Asian 
American children (each 0.4 per 
100 000)‍.
In contrast with patterns of firearm 
homicide, white and American Indian 
children have the highest annual 
average rates of firearm suicide (each 
2.2 per 100 000)‍. From 2012 to 2014, 
the annual rate of firearm suicide 
among white and American Indian 
children was nearly 4 times higher 
than the rate for African American 
(0.6 per 100 000)‍ and Hispanic (0.5 
per 100 000)‍ children and over 5 
times the rate for Asian American 
children (0.4 per 100 000)‍. From 
2012 to 2014, rates of unintentional 
firearm deaths were between 0.1 
and 0.2 per 100 000 across racial and 
ethnic groups. The rate for African 
American children was twice as high 
(0.2 per 100 000)‍ as the rate for 
white children (0.1 per 100 000)‍ and 
4 times the rate for Hispanic children 
(0.05 per 100 000)‍.
Similar to fatal firearm injuries, 
boys incur the majority of nonfatal 
firearm injuries treated in US EDs, 
accounting for ∼84% of all nonfatal 
firearm injuries medically treated 
each year. From 2012 to 2014, the 
average annual rate of nonfatal 
firearm injuries for boys was 12.9 
per 100 000, or ∼5 times the rate for 
girls (2.6 per 100 000)‍. Most of these 
injuries (71%)‍ were from a firearm-
related assault. Older children (aged 
13–17)‍ accounted for 88% of all 
nonfatal firearm injuries treated in 
an ED. The overall average annual 
rate of nonfatal firearm injuries for 
older children was ∼19 times the rate 
for younger children (24.4 vs 1.3 per 
100 000)‍.
Where Do Most Firearm Deaths 
Occur?
Patterns of firearm mortality vary 
by state (Fig 1)‍. Several states (DE, 
HI, ME, NH, ND, RI, SD, and VT)‍ had 
20 or fewer child firearm deaths 
(the threshold below which rates are 
considered unstable because they 
are based on low counts)‍ over the 
entire 5-year period from 2010 to 
2014. The District of Columbia and 
Louisiana had the highest rates of 
child firearm mortality in the nation 
(4.5 and 4.2 per 100 000 children, 
respectively)‍. The highest rates of 
firearm homicide among children 
were largely concentrated across 7 
Southern states (AL, FL, GA, LA, MS, 
SC, and TN)‍, 4 Midwestern states (IL, 
MO, MI, and OH)‍, 2 Western states 
(CA and NV)‍, and 3 Northeastern 
states (CT, MD, and PA)‍. Firearm 
suicides among children were more 
dispersed across the United States. 
An observable pattern not defined 
by region is also seen extending from 
Louisiana, Arkansas, and the upper 
Midwest to Oklahoma, Kansas, and 
through the Western states (eg, CO, 
NM, UT, NV, ID, MT, OR, and WA)‍. 
Alaska, Montana, and Idaho had the 
highest rates of child firearm suicides 
over the 5-year period.
Trends
Trends in firearm death rates 
for the nation between 2002 and 
2014 are depicted in Fig 2. Child 
firearm homicide rates increased 
significantly from 2002 to 2007, 
increasing 17% from 1.2 to 1.4 per 
100 000 (APC = 4.6, P < .05)‍, and 
exhibited a significant decline from 
2007 to 2014, decreasing 36% from 
1.4 to 0.9 (APC = −6.7, P < .05)‍. 
Child firearm suicide rates, on the 
other hand, showed a significant 
downward trend between 2002 and 
2007, decreasing 23% from 1.3 to 
1.0 (APC = −4.2, P < .05)‍, but then a 
significant upward trend between 
2007 and 2014, increasing 60% from

1.0 to 1.6 (APC = 6.3, P < .05)‍ to the 
highest rate seen over the period 
examined. Unintentional firearm 
deaths exhibited a significant overall 
decrease between 2002 and 2014 
(APC = −2.7, P < .05)‍.
circumstances and Other Incident 
characteristics
National data on the circumstances 
surrounding child firearm deaths 
are not available. Although limited 
to the 17 states participating in 
NVDRS during the period of the 
study, data from NVDRS provide 
the only detailed and systematically 
collected circumstance information 
available regarding the factors 
surrounding these deaths. These 
data indicate that during the study 
period (2003–2013)‍, approximately 
half of all incidents involving firearm 
homicides of younger children (aged 
0–12 years)‍ had multiple victims 
versus 13% of incidents with victims 
aged 13 to 17 years (Table 2)‍. The 
perpetrator died by suicide in 42% 
of firearm homicides of younger 
children versus 6% of cases with 
older children. Information about the 
perpetrator’s age was known in 78% 
of the deaths for younger children 
and in 54% for older children. Over 
two-thirds of perpetrators in cases 
involving younger children were 25 
years of age or older. Older children 
were primarily killed by someone 
of the same age (13–17 years)‍ or 
close in age (18–24 years)‍. The vast 
majority of younger children (85%)‍ 
were killed in a home, whereas 
older victims were equally likely 
to be killed in a home (39%)‍ or on 
the streets (38%)‍. The majority of 
younger and older children were 
killed with a handgun (75% and 85%, 
respectively)‍.
Firearm homicides of younger 
children were significantly more 
likely to be intimate partner 
violence–related (ie, related to 
conflict between intimate partners, 
such as violence between parents)‍, 
to be incidents in which the victim

be precipitated by family relationship 
problems. Firearm homicides of older 
children were significantly more 
likely to be precipitated by another 
crime, to be gang-related, to have 
drug involvement, and/or to involve 
weapon use also on the part of the 
victim.
Firearm suicides among children 
were often precipitated by situational 
factors such as a crisis in the past 
or upcoming 2 weeks (42%)‍ and 
relationship problems (71%)‍ with 
an intimate partner, friend, or family 
member. Mental health factors were 
also evident: 34% had a depressed 
mood at the time of their death, 26% 
had a clinically diagnosed mental 
health problem, and 18% were 
receiving mental health treatment 
at the time of death. More than a 
quarter (26%)‍ disclosed their intent 
to die by suicide to someone before 
the incident. Approximately 60% of 
the firearm suicides were completed 
with a handgun.
Both younger and older 
children were more likely to be 
unintentionally shot and killed 
by someone else than from 
an unintentional self-inflicted 
injury, although the proportion 
unintentionally shot by someone 
else was higher for older children 
(71%)‍ than for younger children 
(56%)‍. When the fatal injury was 
from another person, the shooter was 
most often another younger child 
(54%)‍ in deaths of children aged 0 to 
12 years. Older children were mostly 
shot by someone similar in age (62% 
of shooters were aged 13–17 years)‍, 
followed by shooters age 18 to 24 
years (19%)‍ or less than age 13 
(13%)‍. The majority of both younger 
and older children were fatally 
injured in a home.
The most common circumstance 
surrounding unintentional firearm 
deaths of both younger (60%)‍ and 
older children (49%)‍ was playing 
with a gun. Older children, relative 
to younger children, more often died 
in incidents involving showing a gun 
to others and/or mistakenly thinking 
the gun was unloaded or the safety 
was engaged. A gun was mistaken for 
a toy in 16% of younger children’s 
deaths and in only 1 death involving 
an older child. Approximately 
the same percentage of deaths of 
younger and older children occurred 
while hunting or target shooting 
(14% and 17%, respectively)‍. The 
majority of both younger and older 
children were fatally injured in a 
home. The proportion involving a 
handgun was similar for younger 
and older children (59% and 57%, 
respectively)‍.
DIscussIOn
International studies indicate that 
91% of firearm deaths of children 
aged 0 to 14 years among all high-
income countries worldwide occur 
in the United States, making firearm 
injuries a serious pediatric and public 
health problem in the United States.14 
The findings in this article highlight 
the magnitude and characteristics of 
firearm injuries among children in 
the United States. Approximately 19 
children a day die or are medically 
treated in an ED for a gunshot wound 
in the United States. The majority 
of these children are boys 13 to 17 
years old, African American in the 
case of firearm homicide, and white 
and American Indian in the case of 
firearm suicide.
Firearm homicides of children have 
different contexts depending on age. 
Firearms have been a prominent 
factor in assaults, crime, and 
homicide involving young males, 
particularly ethnic minority males, 
for decades.15 
– 
18 Findings based on 
the NVDRS data indicate that firearm 
homicides among older children 
were more likely to be precipitated 
by another crime, to be gang-related, 
and to have drug involvement, which 
is consistent with other research  
on youth violence.19 As seen in this 
and other studies, younger children  
are often “caught in the crossfire, 
”  
whether as innocent bystanders 
to community violence or during 
incidents of intimate partner violence 
and family conflict.20 Previous 
research indicates that these 
“corollary victims” may be killed 
in an act of retaliation against an 
intimate partner of the perpetrator20

and are much more likely to be killed 
in a homicide followed by suicide of 
the perpetrator compared with older 
children and the general population 
of homicide victims.21
Child firearm suicides were most 
often precipitated by acute crises and 
life stressors such as relationship, 
school, and crime problems. 
Programs that help children and 
youth manage emotions and 
develop skills to resolve problems 
in relationships, school, and with 
peers can reduce adolescent suicidal 
behavior and improve help-seeking 
and coping skills.22, 
 
23 These types of 
programs have also demonstrated 
preventive effects on peer violence 
and dating violence among 
teenagers.24 Mental health factors 
were also evident in firearm suicides 
among children. Pediatricians and 
other primary care providers can 
play an important role in screening 
for depression25 and other behavioral 
health risks, such as alcohol misuse, 
26 
 
to help adolescents receive 
appropriate care and follow-up. 
It is also important to address the 
availability of lethal means during a 
dispute or in times of crisis. Suicides 
are often impulsive in this age group, 
with previous findings indicating that 
many who attempt suicide spend 10 
minutes or less deliberating.27, 
 
28 The 
high case fatality rate associated with 
firearm suicide attempts29 makes 
availability of highly lethal means 
in a time of crisis a crucial factor 
in determining whether a suicide 
attempt will be fatal. Safe storage 
practices (ie, unloading and locking 
all firearms and ammunition)‍ can 
potentially be lifesaving in these 
instances. Previous studies indicate 
that these practices are protective 
against adolescent firearm suicide 
attempts and against unintentional 
firearm deaths in children.30 The 
evidence also suggests that state 
statutes that limit access to firearms 
among persons under a restraining 
order for domestic violence31, 
 
32 are 
associated with a reduced risk for 
intimate partner homicide overall 
and intimate partner homicide by 
firearm.31, 
 
32
Our findings indicate that most 
children who died of unintentional 
firearm injuries were shot by another 
child in their own age range and most 
often in the context of playing with a 
gun or showing it to others. Previous 
research shows that children are 
curious about firearms and will touch 
a firearm even when instructed 
not to do so, 
33 which points to the 
importance of adult supervision and 
the need to store firearms safely and 
out of the reach of children. More 
than one-third of the deaths of older 
children occurred in incidents in 
which the shooter thought that the 
gun was unloaded or thought that the 
safety was engaged, suggesting a lack 
of knowledge about the safe handling 
of a firearm and potentially a lack of 
adult supervision. Although many 
states have child access prevention 
laws, which are designed to limit 
children’s unsupervised access to 
a firearm, the laws vary in terms of 
their limits of liability and in their 
effectiveness, with effects noted for 
firearm suicides in children ages 
14 to 17 years and in unintentional 
firearm deaths to children less than 
the age of 15.34
Consistent with previous findings 
for all age groups, firearm homicides 
of children tended to occur at higher 
rates in the South and parts of the 
Midwest, particularly in states in 
which high rates of youth homicide 
have been previously reported.35 
The findings for firearm suicide 
reflect the larger, more widespread 
problem of increased suicide rates 
across the nation, particularly after 
the economic downturn that began 
in 2007.36, 
 
37 Although children  
have much lower suicide rates 
compared with other age groups, 
some of the steepest increases from 
1999 to 2014 have been found 
among children 10 to 14 years of 
age.37 Unintentional firearm death 
rates have been steadily declining 
for several decades.12, 
 
38 Our findings 
are consistent with this overall 
trend.
It is important to remember 
that many types of violence are 
interconnected39 and that firearm 
violence does not stand in isolation 
when developing preventive 
interventions. There are a number of 
strategies to prevent violence. These 
include street outreach approaches 
such as Cure Violence and Safe 
Streets, which when implemented 
fully have been associated with 
reductions in gun violence, gang-
related violence, homicide, and 
nonfatal assault-related injuries40, 
 
41;  
universal school-based programs 
as noted previously22– 
24; early 
childhood education, which has 
demonstrated long-term effects 
on youth involvement in serious 
violence and delinquency42, 
 
43; and 
therapeutic approaches, which 
have demonstrated impacts on 
adolescent suicidal behavior, 
44 youth 
gang involvement, felony arrests 
for violence, 
45, 
 
46 and the harms of 
violence exposures.47, 
 
48 It is also 
important to address poverty and the 
other contextual factors that mediate 
and moderate the risk for these forms 
of violence.49
The findings in this paper are 
subject to a few limitations. Firstly, 
unintentional firearm deaths may be 
significantly underreported in the 
CDC’s vital statistics system as other 
studies have noted.50 It is difficult 
to know the extent to which this 
underreporting differentially changes 
the victimization patterns reported 
here. Secondly, there is potential 
misclassification of certain racial 
and ethnic groups (eg, Hispanics, 
Asian Americans, and American 
Indians)‍ in death certificate data.51 
Estimates derived from these data 
may therefore underestimate 
victimization in these groups. The 
extent of missing data on race and 
ethnicity in NEISS precluded an 
examination of nonfatal firearm 
injuries by race and ethnicity.

Nonfatal firearm injuries treated 
in settings other than hospital EDs 
and inpatient settings, or which are 
not medically treated at all, are also 
not included in this study. Finally, 
although NVDRS provides the only 
available detailed circumstance 
information related to violent deaths 
and unintentional firearm deaths, 
the findings reported here are based 
on data from states funded from 
2003 to 2013 and are not nationally 
representative.
cOnclusIOns
Pediatric firearm injuries and 
deaths are an important public 
health problem in the United States, 
contributing substantially each year 
to premature death, illness, and 
disability of children. Understanding 
the nature, magnitude, and health 
impact of firearm violence against 
children is an important first step. 
Finding ways to prevent such injuries 
and ensure that all children have safe, 
stable, nurturing relationships and 
environments52 remains one of our 
most important priorities.
