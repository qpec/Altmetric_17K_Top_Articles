ABSTRACT
The focus of this paper is to explore better strategies
for optimising bone strength and reducing risk of
fracture, while at the same time decreasing risk of
cardiovascular disease. The majority of Americans do
not consume the current recommended dietary
allowance for calcium, and the lifetime risk of
osteoporosis is about 50%. However, traditional
mononutrient calcium supplements may not be ideal.
We comprehensively and systematically reviewed the
scientific literature in order to determine the optimal
dietary strategies and nutritional supplements for long-
term skeletal health and cardiovascular health. To
summarise, the following steps may be helpful for
building strong bones while maintaining soft and
supple arteries: (1) calcium is best obtained from
dietary sources rather than supplements; (2) ensure
that adequate animal protein intake is coupled with
calcium intake of 1000 mg/day; (3) maintain vitamin D
levels in the normal range; (4) increase intake of fruits
and vegetables to alkalinise the system and promote
bone health; (5) concomitantly increase potassium
consumption while reducing sodium intake; (6)
consider increasing the intake of foods rich in vitamins
K1 and K2; (7) consider including bones in the diet;
they are a rich source of calcium-hydroxyapatite and
many other nutrients needed for building bone.
INTRODUCTION
Calcium: general physiology and
epidemiology
Calcium is the most ubiquitous mineral in
the human body. An average-sized adult
body contains approximately 1000 to 1200 g
of calcium, which is predominately incorpo-
rated into bones and teeth in the form of
calcium-hydroxyapatite
(Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2)
crystals. The remainder circulates throughout
the blood and soft tissues, and plays funda-
mental roles in cell conduction, muscle func-
tion,
hormone
regulation,
vitamin
(Vit)
K-dependent
pathways,
and
cardiac
and
blood vessel function.1
Some studies indicate only 30% of the US
population
consumes
the
Recommended
Dietary Allowance of calcium, which is 1000–
1200 mg daily.1 Furthermore, humans absorb
only about 30% of calcium from foods depend-
ing on the specific source.1 The body will
demineralise its own skeletal system to maintain
serum calcium levels in situations where dietary
calcium is insufficient and/or absorption is
decreased, and/or excretion is increased.2
Osteopenia/osteoporosis: an epidemic
Starting at about age 50 years, postmenopau-
sal women lose about 0.7–2% of their bone
mass each year, while men over age 50 years
lose 0.5–0.7% yearly. Between ages 45 and
75 years, women, on average, lose 30% of
their bone mass, whereas men lose 15%.
According to the US Surgeon General’s
Report, 1 in 2 Americans over age 50 years is
expected to have or to be at risk of develop-
ing osteoporosis.3 Osteoporosis causes 8.9
million fractures annually, with an estimated
cumulative cost of incident fractures pre-
dicted
at
US$474
billion
over
the
next
KEY QUESTIONS
What is already known about this subject?
▸ The lifetime risk of osteoporosis is approxi-
mately 50%. Most people do not consume the
Recommended
Daily
Allowance
of
calcium.
Traditional mononutrient calcium supplements
may not be ideal for promoting long-term car-
diovascular and skeletal health.
What does this study add?
▸ Calcium is ideally obtained from dietary sources.
The form of calcium in bones and bone meal is
calcium-hydroxyapatite, which may be particu-
larly effective for building bone.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
▸ Increased consumption of calcium-rich foods
such as bones, fermented dairy products (e.g.
yogurt, kefir, cheese), leafy greens, almonds,
and chia seeds may be effective for improving
both skeletal and cardiovascular health.

 20 years in the USA.3–6 Among adult women over age
45 years, osteoporosis accounts for more days spent in
hospital than many other diseases such as diabetes, myo-
cardial
infarction
(MI),
chronic
obstructive
airway
disease and breast cancer.3 Fragility fractures are the
primary cause of hospitalisation and/or death for US
adults ≥ age 65 years and older; and 44% of nursing
home admissions are due to fractures.3
A Mayo Clinic study reported that compared to 30 years
ago, forearm fractures have risen more than 32% in boys
and 56% in girls. The authors concluded that dietary
changes, including insufficient calcium and excess phos-
phate, were significantly associated with increased frac-
tures.7 Public health approaches are crucial to prevent
symptomatic bone disease, but widespread pharmaco-
logical prophylaxis is prohibitively expensive and carries
potential serious adverse effects.
Cardiovascular disease and bone mineral disease:
a calcium nexus
Strong
epidemiological
associations
exist
between
decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and increased
risk of both cardiovascular (CV) disease and CV death.8
For example, individuals with osteoporosis have a higher
risk of coronary artery disease, and vice versa. This
problem will be magnified if the therapies for osteopor-
osis (eg, calcium supplements) independently increase
risk of MI.
Issues with dairy as primary source of calcium
Dairy foods and beverages account for about 70% of all
dietary calcium intake among Americans. Dozens of epi-
demiological and randomised controlled trials in adults
and children have used dairy products as the principal
source of calcium, and have credited dairy intake with
preventive benefits on study end points including bone
mass, fractures and osteoporosis. A recent meta-analysis
of over 270 000 people showed a strong trend for dairy
intake protecting against hip fracture; the relative risk
(RR) of hip fracture per daily glass of milk was 0.91,
95% CI 0.81 to 1.01.9
In many industrialised nations, milk is often the most
cost-effective strategy for achieving recommended levels
of calcium intake at a population level. Yet, legitimate
concerns exist regarding potential deleterious effects of
chronic dairy intake on health.10–16 Dairy foods, on an
evolutionary time scale, are relative ‘new-comers’ to the
hominin diet.17 Domestication of cattle, sheep and goats
first occurred approximately 11 000–10 000 years Before
Present.17 Furthermore, it appears that an estimated
65% of the worldwide population expresses the pheno-
type of lactase non-persistence.18
Consumption of cow’s milk has been inconsistently
associated with cataracts, ovarian and prostate cancers,
and Parkinson’s disease, and it has been implicated in
certain autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes
and multiple sclerosis. Overall, the evidence for dairy-
induced human disease appears to be most consistent
for prostate cancer and for type 1 diabetes.19
A recent study of over 106 000 adults followed for
20 years showed that drinking three or more glasses of
milk per day was associated with increased risks for bone
fracture and higher mortality rates compared with drink-
ing not more than one glass of milk per day.20 By con-
trast, for the women in that study, each daily serving of
cheese and/or other fermented milk products such as
yogurt was associated with a 10–15% decrease in the
rates of mortality and hip fractures (p<0.001). However,
this was an observational study with inherent limitations
such as residual confounding and reverse causation, and
thus, firm conclusions cannot be drawn from the data.
The sugar in milk, lactose, is broken down in the
gastrointestinal
tract
to
d-galactose
and
d-glucose.
d-Galactose has been found to increase inflammation
and oxidation in adult humans, and in adult animals
this sugar triggers accelerated ageing, neurodegenera-
tion, and a shortened life span.20
Thus, cow’s milk, though rich in many nutrients,
including calcium, has issues that render it less than
ideal as a dietary staple for many adults. On the con-
trary, fermented dairy foods, such as yogurt and cheese,
appear to be safer than milk, possibly because the most
or all of d-galactose has been metabolised by bacteria.20
Plant-based dietary sources of calcium and protein:
effects on bone health
Most vegetarians, especially vegans, appear to absorb less
calcium because of the oxalic and phytic acid contained
in many plant, grain and legume products.1 Indeed,
several studies have reported that risks of bone fracture
are higher in vegans—likely due, at least in part, to their
lower dietary calcium intake, and/or poor absorption of
this key mineral (table 1).21
Dietary protein, calcium and bone health
Evolutionary evidence suggests that preagricultural diets
were net base-yielding, and contributed to the robust

 bone health generally seen among hunter-gatherers.10 17
By contrast, processed foods displace base-yielding fruits
and vegetables, thereby shifting to a net acid-yielding
diet.2 22–24
Increased protein intake can raise levels of insulin-like
growth factor 1, which is anabolic, and contributes to
bone building. Experts currently agree that diets moder-
ate in protein (≈1.0–1.5 g/kg/day) are associated with
normal calcium metabolism, and do not adversely alter
bone metabolism; however, at lower protein intakes
(<0.8 g/kg/day),
intestinal
calcium
absorption
is
reduced and levels of parathyroid hormone rise, causing
the mobilisation of calcium from bone.25 26
A growing body of evidence indicates that diets higher
in animal protein associate with greater bone mass and
fewer fractures, particularly if the calcium intake is also
sufficient
(approximately
1000 mg
of
calcium/day)
(figure 1).26–28 Thus, a diet providing ample dietary
calcium, along with alkalising nutrients, such as fruits
and vegetables, and possibly also alkaline mineral waters,
may create a milieu where moderate intake of animal
protein
contributes
favourably
to
bone
health.
Additionally, intake of protein plus calcium with Vit D
may reduce fracture rates through mechanisms inde-
pendent of bone density.29
Magnesium
Maintaining replete magnesium status may reduce risk
for the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, hypertension and
MI.30 Circumstantial and experimental evidence has also
implicated magnesium deficiency in osteoporosis.31–34
Optimal dietary magnesium intake is about 7–10 mg/
kg/day, preferably in the context of a net base-yielding
diet, since a net acid-yielding diet increases excretion of
both magnesium and calcium (table 2).
Potassium/sodium ratio affects calcium metabolism
A potassium/sodium ratio of 1.0 or higher is associated
with a 50% lower risk of CVD and total mortality com-
pared with a ratio under 1.0.35 Reducing excessive
sodium intake is also associated with resultant decreased
urinary calcium excretion, which may help to prevent
against bone demineralisation.36 The average potassium
content (about 2600 mg/day) of the typical US diet is
substantially lower than its sodium content
(about
3300 mg/day).35 Approximately 77% of dietary sodium
chloride is consumed in the form of processed foods. By
contrast,
potassium
is
naturally
abundant
in
many
unprocessed foods, especially vegetables, fruits, tubers,
nuts, legumes, fish and seafood. In fact, a high potas-
sium/sodium ratio is a reliable marker for high intake
of plant foods and lower intake of processed foods.35
High dietary sodium intake has been associated with
endothelial damage, arterial stiffness, decreased nitric

A diet that contains moderate amounts of fresh, lean, animal protein, when combined with adequate calcium intake,
promotes bone strength and reduces fracture risk. In contrast, high protein diet with inadequate calcium intake increases risk of
fracture.28

 oxide production and increased levels of transforming
growth factor β; whereas, high potassium dietary intake
can counteract these effects.35 36
Evidence indicates that the lowest CV event rates occur
in the moderate sodium excretion and high potassium
excretion groups.37 Thus, it appears that a moderate
sodium diet (2800–3300 mg/day) in conjunction with a
high potassium intake (>3000 mg/day) might confer the
optimal CV benefits for the general population.37
Vit K and bone health
Emerging evidence suggests that Vit K may confer pro-
tective effects for both the skeletal and CV systems. Vit K
operates in the context of other fat-soluble vitamins,
such as A and D, all of which are involved in mainten-
ance of serum calcium concentration, along with the
manipulation of materials leading to bone morphogen-
esis and maintenance of bone tissue.38 Specifically, the
oxidation of Vit K results in activation/carboxylation of
matrix Gla protein (MGP) which is partially responsible
for mineralising bone.39
Also,
Vit
K
is
required
for
the
activation
(γ-carboxylation) of osteocalcin; the inactivated form, or
per cent of undercaboxylated-osteocalcin (%ucOC), has
been found to be a sensitive indicator of Vit K nutrition
status.38 In cross-sectional and prospective analyses, ele-
vated %ucOC, which occurs when Vit K status is low, is a
marker of increased risk for hip fracture in the elderly.38
Several large observational studies appear to support
the benefits of Vit K on bone health.38 A meta-analysis
concluded that while supplementation with phytona-
dione (Vit K1) improved bone health, Vit K2 was even
more effective in this regard.40 This large and statistically
rigorous meta-analysis concluded that high Vit K2 levels
were associated with reduced vertebral fractures by
approximately 60% (95% CI 0.25% to 0.65%), hip frac-
tures by 77% (95% CI 0.12% to 0.47%), and all non-
vertebral fractures by approximately 81% (95% CI
0.11% to 0.35%). Moreover, the benefit of Vit K on
bone may not be due to its ability to increase BMD, but
rather to its effects at increasing bone strength.41
Vit K benefits in CV health
Mounting
evidence
suggests
vascular
calcification
whether in the coronary or peripheral arteries is a
powerful predictor of CV morbidity and all-cause mortal-
ity.42 Prevention of vascular calcification is therefore
important
as
an
early
intervention
to
potentially
improve long-term CV prognosis.
A
major
calcification
inhibitory
factor,
is
a
Vit
K-dependent protein synthesised by vascular smooth
muscle cells.42 Increased Vit K2 intake has been asso-
ciated with decreased arterial calcium deposition and
the ability to reverse vascular calcification in animal
models. Vit K2 prevents pathological calcification in soft
tissues via the carboxylation of protective MGP
. The
undercarboxylated (inactive) species of MGP is formed
during inadequate Vit K status, or as a result of Vit K
antagonists.42
Low
Vit
K
status
is
associated
with
increased vascular calcifications, and can be improved
by effective Vit K supplementation (table 3).43 44 In two
different randomised, double-blind controlled trials, sup-
plemental Vit K has been shown to significantly delay
both the development of coronary artery calcification
and the deterioration of arterial elasticity.45 46
Dietary Vit K exists as two major forms: phylloquinone
(K1) and menaquinones (MK-n). K1, the predominant
dietary form of Vit K, is abundant in dark-green leafy
vegetables and seeds. The main dietary sources for MK-n
in Western populations are fermented foods, especially
natto, cheese and curds (mainly MK-8 and MK-9).47
Calcium supplementation and bone health
A recent large meta-analysis of 26 randomised controlled
trials reported that calcium supplements lowered the
risk of any fracture by a modest but statistically signifi-
cant 11% (n=58 573; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96).48
Even so, the authors concluded that the evidence for
calcium supplements on bone health was weak and
inconsistent.
Other large meta-analyses found that calcium supple-
mentation was most effective for preventing hip fractures
when it was combined with Vit D.49–51 Indeed Vit D
plays a major role in intestinal calcium absorption and
bone health (figure 2).52 Additionally, calcium absorp-
tion is, in part, dependent on adequate stomach acid,
and both these parameters tend to decrease with age.
Drugs that markedly reduce stomach acid, such as
proton pump inhibitors, have been shown to reduce
calcium absorption and increase risk of osteoporosis and
fractures.53
A large meta-analysis focusing on calcium intake and
fracture risk found that in women (seven prospective
cohort studies=170 991 women, 2954 hip fractures), there
was no association between total calcium intake and hip
fracture risk (pooled RR per 300 mg total=1.01; 95% CI
0.97 to 1.05).50 In men (five prospective cohort studies=
68 606 men, 214 hip fractures), the pooled RR per 300 mg
of calcium daily was 0.92 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.03).

 Monosupplementation with calcium, especially using
the most commonly prescribed formulations (calcium
carbonate and calcium citrate) might drive down the
absorption of phosphate, thereby contributing to bone
demineralisation secondary to abnormal calcium to
phosphate ratios.54 The recently updated US Preventive
Services Task Force (USPSTF) has stated that there is
insufficient evidence that calcium and Vit D prevent
fractures in premenopausal women or in men who have
not experienced a prior fracture. Indeed, the USPSTF
now recommends against daily calcium supplementation
for primary prevention of fragility fractures; stating, ‘the
balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined’.55
Calcium supplementation and arterial health
The
Women’s
Health
Initiative,
a
7-year,
placebo-
controlled randomised trial involving 36 282 partici-
pants, found that calcium supplementation with Vit D
(1000 mg/400 IU daily) had a neutral effect on coron-
ary risk and cerebrovascular risk.56 By contrast, some
subsequent publications have reported data challenging
the CV safety of calcium supplementation.57–60
One meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials involv-
ing 28 000 participants reported that a daily calcium sup-
plement was associated with an increased risk of MI (HR
1.24, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.45, p=0.004).58 A prospective
study of 388 229 men and women with a 12-year
follow-up showed that calcium supplementation was asso-
ciated with elevated risk of heart disease death in men,
but not in women.61 Yet, only one randomised con-
trolled trial of calcium supplementation using adverse
cardiac events as the primary end point has been pub-
lished.
In
that
study,
daily
supplementation
using
1200 mg of calcium carbonate did not increase the risk
of CV death or hospitalisation for 1460 women (mean
age 75 years).62
In a prospective cohort study with a mean follow-up of
19 years, both high and low dietary calcium intakes were
associated with increased CV disease and higher all-cause
mortality (figure 3).51 Importantly, a low dietary calcium
intake with or without calcium supplementation is also
associated with higher CV morbidity and mortality rates.51
Elevated serum calcium concentrations are associated
with carotid artery plaque thickness, arterial and aortic
calcification, and incidence of MI.57 58 Transient eleva-
tions in serum calcium levels have been noted following
ingestion of 500–1000 mg of calcium supplements.63 64
By contrast, calcium from dietary sources or bone
(calcium
hydroxyapatite)
ingestion
results
in
much
smaller changes in circulating calcium levels.65
Other possible mechanisms that have linked calcium
supplements with CV disease include coronary artery
calcification, impaired vasodilation, increased arterial
stiffness, and hypercoagulability.51 66

mortality during follow-up. Data were fully adjusted for

longevity is about 1000 mg/day, with higher and lower calcium
intakes associated with increased CV mortality.51

 Food as the ideal source of calcium
The traditional focus in nutrition based on supplemen-
tation of single isolated nutrients may be especially mis-
guided in the case of calcium and bone health. A diet
supplemented with calcium as a mononutrient pill is not
ideal for promoting bone health, and may instead accel-
erate arterial plaque growth and vascular calcification,
and increase risk of MI. Food-based solutions place
evidence-based emphasis on finding the admixture of
foods that balance the acid–base status of the body, and
that most favourably impact the body’s calcium metabol-
ism and bone health.
A plant-rich, grain-free diet alters the acid–base status
so as to be slightly alkaline, which is conducive for bone
health. However, plants are relatively poor sources of
calcium compared to animal sources such as dairy pro-
ducts and animal bones. We suspect that milk, though
an excellent source of bioavailable calcium, has poten-
tial
adverse
health
effects
for
some
individuals.
Additionally, 65% of the world’s population show some
decrease
in
lactase
activity
during
adulthood.
Importantly, fermented dairy has been linked to favour-
able outcomes for bone health and mortality risk.
Benefits of consuming bones or bone meal
Ethnographic and anthropological studies indicate that
adult human hunter-gatherers consumed most of their
calcium in the form of bones from animals, such as
small and large mammals, birds, fish and reptiles.67 68
Indeed through millions of years of evolution, we are
genetically adapted to consume a large proportion of
our dietary calcium from bones, where calcium is
absorbed along with a matrix of nutrients including
magnesium, phosphorus, strontium, zinc, iron, copper,
collagen protein, aminoglycans and osteocalcin—all of
which
also
support
robust
bone
formation.68
69
Theoretically, including animal bones (sardines, salmon,
soft chicken bones, bone broths, etc) may be an effective
dietary strategy to ensure adequate calcium intake and
to optimise long-term bone health.
Mineral supplements made from bone meal, when
taken with food, theoretically might provide a more
practical means to ensure adequate calcium intake
without predisposing to CVD risk. Ingestion of micro-
crystalline hydroxyapatite (the form of calcium found in
bone) produces less of an acute spike in blood calcium
levels compared to soluble calcium salts typically used in
standard supplements, and thus may be less likely to
increase
vascular
calcification
and
coronary
risk.65
Hydroxyapatite also stimulates bone osteoblast cells and
contains
virtually
all
the
essential
building
blocks
needed to construct bone tissue. In a small placebo-
controlled randomised trial, women who took 1000 mg
of calcium in the form of hydroxyapatite in conjunction
with oral Vit D showed a significant increase in bone
thickness, whereas those who took 1000 mg of a stand-
ard calcium carbonate supplement did not (figure 4).70
Another double-blind placebo-controlled study found
that supplementing with hydroxyapatite and Vit D3 sig-
nificantly
improved
serological
markers
of
bone
health.15
In theory, the addition of Vit K2 and magnesium to an
organic bone meal supplement might further enhance
its effectiveness and reduce the risk of soft tissue calcifi-
cation. However, the quantity and quality of the experi-
mental data testing the effects of Vit D and calcium on
bone health dwarfs the data for bone meal supplementa-
tion. Much larger randomised trials will be needed to
firmly establish the safety and effectiveness of bone meal
as well as Vit K and magnesium as supplements for
building bone without increasing vascular calcification.
CONCLUSION
It is becoming increasingly clear that the fundamental
unit for nutrition is the food (eg, milk, nuts, eggs), not
the nutrient (eg, calcium, saturated fat, cholesterol). A
nutrient perceived as beneficial, such as calcium, may be
unhealthy if the parent food, say milk, contains other
nutrients, such as galactose, that on the balance might
stimulate adverse effects in the body. In theory, consum-
ing calcium-rich foods such as bones, fermented dairy
(eg, unsweetened yogurt, kefir, cheese), leafy greens,
almonds, and chia seeds may be an effective strategy for
improving both calcium intake and long-term health.

Figure 4
Change in cortical bone thickness among 64
women with osteopenia randomised to 14-month treatment
with no mineral therapy (red bar), calcium gluconate (blue
bar), or calcium hydroxyapatite (green bar). The control group
showed bone loss (p<0.01 compared to baseline), while the
hydroxyapatite group showed bone gain (p<0.01 compared to
baseline). The calcium gluconate showed no significant
change.70
