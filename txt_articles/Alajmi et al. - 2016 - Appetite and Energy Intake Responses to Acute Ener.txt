STENSEL. Appetite and Energy Intake Responses to Acute Energy Deficits in Females versus Males. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 48,
No. 3, pp. 412–420, 2016. Purpose: To explore whether compensatory responses to acute energy deficits induced by exercise or diet
differ by sex. Methods: In experiment one, 12 healthy women completed three 9-h trials (control, exercise-induced (Ex-Def) and food
restriction–induced energy deficit (Food-Def)) with identical energy deficits being imposed in the Ex-Def (90-min run, È70% of
V
˙ O2max) and Food-Def trials. In experiment two, 10 men and 10 women completed two 7-h trials (control and exercise). Sixty minutes
of running (È70% of V
˙ O2max) was performed at the beginning of the exercise trial. The participants rested throughout the remainder
of the exercise trial and during the control trial. Appetite ratings, plasma concentrations of gut hormones, and ad libitum energy intake
were assessed during main trials. Results: In experiment one, an energy deficit of approximately 3500 kJ induced via food restriction
increased appetite and food intake. These changes corresponded with heightened concentrations of plasma acylated ghrelin and lower
peptide YY3–36. None of these compensatory responses were apparent when an equivalent energy deficit was induced by exercise. In
experiment two, appetite ratings and plasma acylated ghrelin concentrations were lower in exercise than in control, but energy intake did
not differ between trials. The appetite, acylated ghrelin, and energy intake response to exercise did not differ between men and women.
Conclusions: Women exhibit compensatory appetite, gut hormone, and food intake responses to acute energy restriction but not
in response to an acute bout of exercise. Additionally, men and women seem to exhibit similar acylated ghrelin and PYY3–36 responses
to exercise-induced energy deficits. These findings advance understanding regarding the interaction between exercise and energy homeo-
stasis in women. Key Words: SEX-BASED DIFFERENCES, GASTROINTESTINAL HORMONES, COMPENSATION, ENERGY

T
he regulation of appetite control and energy balance
is an area of scientific inquiry, which continues to
receive widespread attention across disciplines. To
date, as in many fields of science, the foundation of our
knowledge within appetite regulation has been gleaned from
studies conducted predominantly in men. Consequently, less
is known, specifically regarding the regulation of appetite
control and energy balance in women, and the potential for
sex-based differences has not been thoroughly investigated.
Preliminary research has hinted that appetite and appetite-
regulatory hormones may display divergent responses to
nutritional interventions between men and women; however,
this proposition continues to be debated (5). Specifically,
it has been suggested that women, compared to men, ex-
hibit more potent compensatory responses (appetite, appetite
regulatory hormones, food intake) to energy deficits to pre-
serve energy balance and reproductive function (14). This
viewpoint is supported by studies demonstrating that men
exhibit greater reductions in body fat and body mass than
women in response to supervised exercise training (8,19,35).
Conversely, other research has suggested that differences in
weight loss and adiposity responses to exercise are unrelated
to sex (5,6).
Sex-based differences in the short-term regulation of ap-
petite and energy balance were previously investigated in
a carefully designed experimental study using consecutive
days of exercise to induce an energy deficit in male and
female participants (15). The researchers showed that this

 acute exercise-induced energy deficit triggered a compen-
satory increase in circulating acylated ghrelin (appetite-
stimulating hormone) in women but not in men. These
changes corresponded with higher appetite ratings in women
than men and suggest that sex-based differences may be
apparent in the early appetite and gut hormone response to
exercise-induced energy deficits.
Over the past decade, our laboratory has conducted many
acute experimental trials seeking to enhance understanding
concerning the short-term regulation of appetite and energy
balance (21,31). In a sample of male participants, we re-
cently demonstrated that the induction of an acute energy
deficit by food restriction elicited a rapid and robust com-
pensatory appetite, gut hormone (acylated ghrelin and
PYY3–36), and energy intake response whereas the same
energy deficit imposed by exercise had no effect (20). These
findings suggest that the method by which an energy deficit
is imposed has a marked impact on the subsequent physio-
logical and behavioral response. It is currently unknown
whether women exhibit the same acute responses to exercise
and food restriction as men. This information has important
implications regarding the use of lifestyle therapies to assist
weight control in women.
Within this report, we describe the findings from two
acute experimental studies, which sought to provide new
information regarding the short-term appetite, food intake,
and appetite hormone responses to exercise and food-
induced energy deficits in men and women. In experiment 1;
we compared the appetite, energy intake, acylated ghrelin, and
PYY3–36 responses to an equivalent energy deficit induced
by exercise or energy restriction in women. In experiment 2,
we directly compared appetite, food intake, and circulating
acylated ghrelin responses to an exercise-induced energy
deficit in men versus women. Our findings identify a high
degree of similarity in the acute response to energy deficits
in men and women.
METHODS
Experimental protocol. This investigation contained
two experiments that were conducted according to the
guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. All
procedures were approved by the Institutional Ethics Advi-
sory Committee, and written informed consent was obtained
from all participants. Study participants were nonsmokers,
not taking medication, weight stable for at least 6 months
before participation, and were not dieting. Participants had
no known history of cardiovascular/metabolic disease, and
the female participants were of reproductive age but were
not pregnant. In each study, participants were recreationally
active, i.e., were familiar with exercise but were not formally
trained in endurance activities such as running or cycling.
The participants completed a weighed food diary in the
24 h before the first main trial of each experiment and rep-
licated this before each subsequent trial. Alcohol, caffeine,
and strenuous physical activity were not permitted during
this period. All trials commenced between 8:00 a.m. and
9:00 a.m. after an overnight fast of at least 10 h, and the
participants exerted themselves minimally when traveling to
the laboratory, using motorized transport when possible.
Verbal confirmation of dietary and exercise standardization
was obtained at the beginning of each experimental trial.
The female participants completed all main trials within the
follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (4).
Preliminary trials. To determine the running speed re-
quired to elicit 70% of maximum oxygen uptake (V
˙ O2max)
for each individual, the participants completed a preliminary
trial before the main trials for each experiment. This con-
sisted of a submaximal running test and a V
˙ O2max test on a
motorized treadmill (34). Anthropometric measurements and
study questionnaires, e.g., Three Factor Eating Questionnaire
(TFEQ) (33), were also taken/completed at this time. At this
visit, the participants also verbally confirmed acceptability of
the test meals and ad libitum meals subsequently to be pro-
vided during main experimental trials.
In experiment one, a second preliminary trial was com-
pleted to determine the net energy cost of exercise, which
was needed to calculate food provision in the main trials
and to enable trial randomization in advance. During this
session, the participants ran for 90 min at 70% of V
˙ O2max,
with expired air samples being collected into Douglas bags
at 15-min intervals to calculate energy expenditure using the
equations provided by Frayn (12).
Experiment one. Twelve female participants performed
three 9-h experimental trials (control (Con)), exercise-
induced energy deficit (Ex-Def) and diet-induced energy
deficit (Food-Def)) separated by 1 wk in a randomized
counterbalanced design. To ensure standardization of men-
strual phase, the participants_ first main trial was undertaken
at the beginning of their follicular phase, with their second
trial occurring 1 wk later. The participants_ third main trial
was subsequently undertaken at the beginning of their next
cycle approximately 4 wk later. The participants rested
within the laboratory throughout all trials, with participants
being permitted to read, work at a computer, or watch DVDs,
which had been screened to ensure that there was no overt
emphasis on food and drink. The exception to this occurred at
0–1.5 h during Ex-Def, where participants performed 90 min
of treadmill running at approximately 70% of V
˙ O2max (iden-
tical to that performed during the preliminary trial). Resting
expired air samples were collected from 0 to 1.5 h during the
Con and Food-Def trials to calculate the net energy expen-
diture of exercise (gross energy expenditure of exercise minus
energy expenditure at rest) (12).
Identical test meals were provided at 2 h (breakfast) and
4.75 h (lunch) and were each consumed within 15 min. The
meals consisted of a tuna and mayonnaise sandwich, salted
crisps, chocolate muffin, and green apple. The macronutrient
composition of the meal was 47% carbohydrate, 18% pro-
tein, and 35% fat. The energy content of the test meals
was identical in Con and Ex-Def (2778 (109) kJ), with each
meal providing 35% of the participants_ estimated daily

 energy needs for a sedentary day. This calculation was based
on an estimation of each participant_s daily energy needs,
which was determined using a validated equation for resting
metabolic rate (28) that was multiplied by an activity factor
(1.4) deemed appropriate for a sedentary day (10). In Food-
Def, the energy content of the test meals was reduced (1025
(159) kJ) by deducting the net energy expenditure of exer-
cise from the energy provided at the test meals during Con
and Ex-Def. This energy deficit was individually prescribed
based on the exercise energy expenditure data derived from
the preliminary trials, and the total amount of energy
deducted was divided equally between breakfast and lunch.
Therefore, equivalent energy deficits were induced in Ex-
Def and Food-Def relative to Con. The macronutrient per-
centage of the test meals was identical across main trials,
i.e., only the meal energy content was altered in the Food-
Def trial.
Experiment two. Ten female and 10 male participants
performed two 7-h experimental trials (exercise and control)
separated by 1 wk in a randomized counterbalanced design.
The female participants completed both main trials during
the follicular phase (days 1–11) of their menstrual cycle. The
participants rested within the laboratory throughout each
trial, except from zero to 1 h during the exercise trial, where
the participants performed 60 min of treadmill running at
approximately 70% of V
˙ O2max. Expired air samples were
collected as described earlier to calculate the net energy
expenditure of exercise. A test meal was provided at 2 h,
consisting of a ham sandwich, banana, salted crisps, and
chocolate bar. The macronutrient composition of the meals
was 63% carbohydrate, 9% protein, and 28% fat. The energy
content was 42 kJIkgj1 body mass (men, 3167 (395) kJ;
women, 2599 (305) kJ).
Appetite perceptions and ad libitum buffet meals.
Appetite perceptions (hunger, satisfaction, fullness, and pro-
spective food consumption) were assessed at baseline and
every 30 min during both experiments using 100-mm visual
analog scales (11). An overall appetite rating was calculated
for each time point as the mean value of the four appetite
perceptions after inverting the values for satisfaction and
fullness (32). At 8 h during experiment one and 5 h during
experiment two, the participants were given 30-min access to
a buffet meal from which they were free to select and con-
sume food ad libitum. The buffet was set up identically before
each meal, with food being presented in excess of expected
consumption. The items available were milk, three varieties
of cereal, cereal bars, white bread, brown bread, ham, cheese,
tuna, mayonnaise, butter, margarine, cookies, chocolate rolls,
apples, oranges, and bananas. The participants were told to
eat until satisfied and that additional food was available if
desired. The participants were not overtly aware that their
food intake was being monitored with actual intake being
deduced by experimenters covertly reweighing leftover foods
after ad libitum meals. Energy and macronutrient intake was
determined using values provided by the food manufacturers.
All meals were consumed in isolation so that social influence
did not affect food selection. Water was available ad libitum
throughout each trial.
Blood sampling and analysis. During the experi-
mental trials, venous blood samples were collected via a
cannula (Venflon, Becton Dickinson, Helsinborg, Sweden)
inserted into an antecubital vein. Blood samples were col-
lected at baseline, 2, 3, 4.75, 6, 7, 8, and 9 h in experiment
one and baseline, 0.5, 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, and 7 h
in experiment two. Plasma acylated ghrelin concentrations
were measured from blood samples in both experiments,
and PYY3–36 was additionally measured in experiment one.
Details on acylated ghrelin and PYY3–36 sample collection
and processing have been described in-depth previously (7).
A commercially available enzyme immunoassay was used
to determine plasma concentrations of acylated ghrelin (SPI
BIO, Montigny le Bretonneux, France). Plasma concentra-
tions of PYY3–36 were determined using a commercially
available radioimmunoassay (Millipore, Watford, UK). To
eliminate interassay variation, samples from each participant
were analyzed in the same run. The within-batch coefficients
of variation for the assays were 6.9% and 6.8% for acylated
ghrelin and PYY3–36, respectively.
Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using IBM
SPSS statistics version 19 for Windows. Time-averaged area
under the curve (AUC) values were calculated using the
trapezoidal method. For experiment one, one-way repeated-
measures ANOVA was used to assess trial-based differences
in energy intake at the ad libitum meal as well as AUC
values for appetite, acylated ghrelin, and PYY3–36. For ex-
periment two, independent samples t-tests were used to assess
baseline differences between male and female participants.
Mixed measures, two-way ANOVA (sex � trial) was used to
assess differences in energy intake and AUC values for ap-
petite and acylated ghrelin. Where significant main effects
were found, post hoc analysis was performed using Holm-
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Statistical
significance for this study was accepted as P e 0.05. Results
in text and tables are presented as mean (SD). Graphical
representations of results are presented as mean (SEM) to
avoid distortion of the graphs.
Sample size calculations. The sample sizes used
within this study were deemed sufficient to detect a signifi-
cant difference in energy intake between trials in experiment
one and a significant difference in relative energy intake
between sexes in experiment two. These variables were se-
lected as the primary outcome measure for each experiment.
The anticipated effect size for a difference in energy intake
between trials for experiment one was based on previous
findings from our laboratory using an identical experimental
protocol in men (20). The anticipated effect size for a dif-
ference in relative energy intake between the sexes for ex-
periment two was based on the findings from previous
research that used methods similar to those of the present
experiment (16). Based on these effect sizes and an alpha
value of 5%, a sample size of 12 participants in experiment
one would have more than 95% power to detect a difference

 in energy intake, and 20 participants (10 men and 10 women)
in experiment two would have more than 87% power to detect
a difference in relative energy intake between the sexes. All
calculations were performed using G*power (9).
RESULTS
Experiment One
Participant characteristics and exercise responses.
The physical characteristics of the participants are described
in Table 1. The participants rated ‘‘low’’ for each trait within
the TFEQ (cognitive restraint, 7.8 (3.3); disinhibition, 7.9
(3.2); and hunger, 6.9 (3.1). The participants completed the
90-min run at 8.6 (1.0) kmIhj1. This elicited an oxygen con-
sumption equivalent to 70.2% (1.5%) of V
˙ O2max and a net
energy expenditure of 3560 (382) kJ. The nonprotein respi-
ratory exchange ratio was 0.86 (0.04), which reflected a
proportional contribution to energy provision of 54% (13%)
carbohydrate and 46% (13%) fat. Heart rate and RPE were
175 (3) bpm and 13 (1), respectively.
Appetite and energy intake. Overall appetite ratings
did not differ between trials at baseline (Ex-Def, 71 (23);
Food-Def, 77 (12); Con, 75 (16); P = 0.536). One-way
ANOVA revealed higher appetite AUC in Food-Def than
in Ex-Def and Con across the 9-h trial (P G 0.0005; Figs. 1
and 2). At the ad libitum buffet meal, total energy intake
was significantly higher in Food-Def than in Ex-Def and
Control (Ex-Def, 2774 (1682); Food-Def, 3965 (1409); Con-
trol, 2560 (1112) kJ; P G 0.0005). Similarly, energy intake
from fat, protein, and carbohydrate was significantly higher
in Food-Def than in Ex-Def and Control (all P G 0.004;
data not presented).
Plasma acylated ghrelin and PYY3–36 concentra-
tions. Owing to problems with venous cannulation acylated
ghrelin and PYY3–36, data are only available for 11 partici-
pants. Fasting plasma acylated ghrelin concentrations did
not differ significantly between trials at baseline (Con, 148
(100); Ex-Def, 140 (86); Food-Def, 148 (96) pgImLj1; P =
0.422). Acylated ghrelin concentrations were significantly
higher in Food-Def and significantly lowest in Ex-Def across the
9-h trial (P G 0.0005; Figs. 1 and 2). Fasting PYY3–36 concen-
trations did not differ significantly between the trials at baseline
(Con, 77 (39); Ex-Def, 76 (34); Food-Def, 77 (36) pgImLj1;
P = 0.989). Time-averaged AUC for PYY3–36 was signifi-
cantly highest in Ex-Def and significantly lowest in Food-Def
across the 9-h trial (P G 0.0005; Figs. 1 and 2).
Experiment Two
Participant characteristics and exercise responses.
The physical characteristics of the participants are described
and contrasted (men vs women) in Table 1. There were no
differences between men and women in their TFEQ scores
for cognitive restraint (men, 6 (1); women, 8 (2)), disinhibi-
tion (men, 4 (1); women, 6 (1)) or hunger (men, 6 (1); women,

speed in men than in women (men, 10.7 (0.7) kmIhj1; women,
8.4 (0.3) kmIhj1; P = 0.006). The run also generated a greater
net energy expenditure in men than in women (men, 3971
(200) kJ; women, 2536 (126) kJ; P G 0.0005). However, there
was no difference in relative exercise intensity (70.9% (1.4%)
and 73.3% (0.6%) of V
˙ O2max in men and women, respec-
tively; P = 0.130). There was a tendency for a lower heart
rate in men than in women (men, 163 (4) bpm; women, 174
(4) bpm; P = 0.068). Ratings of perceived exertion did not
differ between the sexes (13 (1) and 12 (0) in men and women,
respectively; P = 0.797).

 Appetite and energy intake. Appetite did not differ
by trial (exercise vs Con) or sex at baseline (Female Ex,
61 (22); Female Con, 65 (11); Male Ex, 70 (12); Male Con,
74 (11); all P 9 0.05). Two-way ANOVA revealed main
effects of trial (P = 0.05) and sex (P = 0.01) for AUC ap-
petite ratings across the 7-h trial, with higher appetite ratings
in men than in women and in control compared with exer-
cise (Fig. 3).
Two-factor ANOVA revealed a main effect of sex for
energy intake (P = 0.023) and carbohydrate intake (P =
0.013) during the ad libitum buffet meal, indicating greater
consumption by men than women. Differences between sexes
no longer remained after intakes were adjusted for lean body
mass (both, P Q 0.289). There was no effect of trial for energy
or macronutrient intake and no differences between sexes for
fat and protein intake (both P 9 0.05; Table 2).
Two-factor ANOVA revealed a main effect of trial for
relative energy intake (energy intake minus net energy ex-
penditure of exercise) indicating lower relative energy intake
in the exercise trial compared with control (Female Ex, 442
(1711); Female Con, 2916 (1510); Male Ex, 1414 (2510);
Male Con, 4971 (2648) kJ; P G 0.0005). This resulted in a
similar energy deficit for men and women in the exercise trial
relative to control (men, 3557 (598); women, 2474 (406) kJ;
P = 0.152).
Acylated ghrelin. Owing to problems with venous can-
nulation, acylated ghrelin data are only available for 8 men
and 8 women. Baseline values were not different between the
control and exercise trials (P 9 0.05) but were significantly
higher in women than men (Female Ex, 155 (101); Female
Con, 178 (61); Male Ex, 71 (31); Male Con, 100 (56); P =
0.018). Two-way ANOVA revealed main effects of trial
(P = 0.004) and sex (P = 0.034) for AUC acylated ghrelin
concentrations across the 7-h trial, with higher concentra-
tions in women than in men and in control compared with
exercise (Fig. 4).
DISCUSSION
In recent years, there has been an explosion of research
examining the interaction between exercise and energy ho-
meostasis. One area that has received widespread attention is
the influence of exercise and associated changes in energy
balance on gut hormones, which have been identified as key
regulators of appetite, energy intake, and adiposity (21,30,31).
To date, most research within these areas has been con-
ducted using male participants, meaning that much less is
known regarding the interaction between acute exercise and
food intake regulation in women. The findings of the present

 experiments demonstrate that women respond similarly to
men with regard to short-term responses to energy deficits
induced by exercise and food restriction. Specifically, in
accordance with our previous results in male participants
(20), in experiment one, our female sample demonstrated
rapid and robust compensatory appetite, energy intake, and
appetite hormone responses (acylated ghrelin and PYY3–36)
to energy deficits induced by food restriction but not exer-
cise. Additionally, in experiment two, both male and female
participants exhibited suppressed appetite and circulating
acylated ghrelin in response to exercise without any change
in ad libitum energy intake being apparent. These data pro-
vide new information regarding short-term physiological
and behavioral responses to energy deficits in women.
Experiment one showed that in women, an acute energy
deficit of approximately 3500 kJ robustly stimulated appe-
tite and energy intake when induced via energy restriction,
but such compensatory responses did not occur when an
equivalent deficit was induced by exercise. These outcomes
are consistent with the findings from an identical previous
study in men (20) and highlight the importance of orogastric
mechanisms, e.g., stomach distention and/or passage of nu-
trients through the gastrointestinal tract, for short-term ap-
petite control in men and women (2,36). Such regulatory
mechanisms are complemented by a network of appetite
regulatory hormones, and the identification of higher circu-
lating concentrations of acylated ghrelin, and lower PYY3–36
in response to energy restriction is consistent with the known
acute regulatory actions of these hormones (24,25). In con-
trast, within experiment one, exercise elicited reductions in
circulating acylated ghrelin and elevations in PYY3–36 across
the 9-h trial in our female sample. These responses are con-
sistent with previous studies in men, which have identified
a potent capacity of exercise to perturb the circulating con-
centrations of these hormones in directions associated with a
reduction in appetite (30). The mechanisms promoting such
changes are unclear and were not investigated in the present
experiments. It has been suggested that exercise-induced
changes in sympathetic nervous system activity (3,38) and
splanchnic blood flow (29,37) may be important; however,
additional work is needed to investigate this issue. As per our
previous findings in males (20), the results from experiment
one demonstrate the usefulness of exercise for weight man-
agement in women to minimize compensatory responses as-
sociated with energy deficits produced solely by dietary
restriction. Additional research is now needed to determine
the more prolonged impact of exercise and diet-related energy
deficits on appetite and energy intake in men and women,
research that will provide more tangible information for in-
dividuals concerned with weight management.
The second experiment of this article demonstrated that
an acute bout of exercise, performed at the same relative
exercise intensity, decreased appetite ratings in men and
women. Furthermore, this response was consistent with lower
acylated ghrelin concentrations in both sexes and the absence
of any compensatory increase in ad libitum energy intake.
These findings are consistent with the suggestion that men
and women do not differ in their physiological and behav-
ioral responses to exercise (5), and this notion is supported
by previous data albeit with a very brief period of observa-
tion after exercise (16). Our findings therefore add to the
literature by demonstrating that acute responses to exercise
do not differ between men and women over a prolonged
duration within the laboratory.
In contrast to the present results, previous research has
shown that appetite is not suppressed in women during ex-
ercise (18,22,23). Furthermore, Larson-Meyer et al. (23)
observed an increase in circulating acylated ghrelin in re-
sponse to acute exercise, contrasting the suppression reported
in the present article. The discrepant findings with regard to
appetite may be related to exercise intensity, with the intensity
in the present studies being much greater (70% of V
˙ O2max)
than that used by Hopkins et al. (18) (È50% of V
˙ O2max).
Training status and familiarity with exercise also moderate
exercise-related appetite responses (26,27), and the lack of
influence of exercise on appetite in the studies of King et al.

 (22) and Larson-Meyer et al. (23) may be because their
participants were regularly active and particularly familiar
with the mode of exercise used. An increase in circulating
acylated ghrelin in response to exercise (23) contrasts the
present findings and the bulk of the literature that have studied
men (30). Regression to the mean may have been a con-
founding factor in the study of Larson-Meyer et al. (23),
however. Furthermore, differences in the analytical tech-
niques used between studies may also be influential. None-
theless, despite these noted discrepancies, ad libitum energy
intake remained unchanged in each of the aforementioned
studies. Thus, as seen in men, single sessions of exercise do
not seem to influence energy intake in women.
Although we found no differences between the sexes in
compensatory responses to exercise, female participants ex-
hibited significantly higher plasma acylated ghrelin concen-
trations across the main trials compared with men, a finding
that has been reported previously (13). Despite this dispar-
ity, appetite ratings were paradoxically higher in men than
women across the main trials. This difference may highlight
the importance of relative changes in gut hormone concen-
trations, rather than absolute circulating levels, which may
markedly differ between individuals. The similar acylated
ghrelin response to exercise in both sexes may therefore un-
derpin the comparable appetite and energy intake responses
observed. Given that acylated ghrelin and PYY3–36 function
within a network of other key appetite regulatory peptides
(17), additional research is needed to characterize the impact
of the present interventions on glucagon-like-peptide-1,
oxyntomodulin, pancreatic polypeptide, and leptin in men
compared with women.
The higher appetite ratings and food intake seen in men in
experiment two supports the concept that lean body mass is
the primary determinant of tonic appetite ratings and energy
intake (1). This theory is further supported by our finding
that energy intake during ad libitum feeding did not differ
between the sexes when expressed per kilogram of lean body
mass. Although acylated ghrelin may in part mediate the epi-
sodic changes in appetite observed in the present study, the
lower tonic concentrations observed in men suggests that lean
body mass may influence appetite and energy intake through
an alternative mechanism. Recent evidence suggests that
resting metabolic rate may be important in this regard (1).
Our findings provide a comparative insight into the short-
term appetite, energy intake, and gut hormone responses to
acute energy deficits in women compared with men. In ac-
cordance with the recent findings of Caudwell et al. (5),
these new data support the perspective that men and women
do not exhibit different physiological or behavioral com-
pensatory responses to energy deficits (induced by exercise
or food restriction), at least during the actual day when an
energy deficit is imposed. Our findings therefore support the
importance of exercise for weight management in women;
however, these data must be considered in light of certain
limitations. First, experiment one and experiment two were
powered to detect changes in food intake, and it is possible
that subtle effects of the present interventions on appetite
and gut hormones may not have been detected. Second, the
implementation of prolonged and strenuous exercise pro-
tocols, completed by recreationally active individuals, may
limit the generalizability of the findings, i.e., to those who
are less active or less fit. The arduous exercise undertaken in
the present studies may therefore not be achievable by many
seeking to commence a weight loss program, and additional
work is needed with overweight and/or obese participants.
In conclusion, the experiments presented in this article
have provided evidence that appetite, energy intake, and gut
hormone responses to acute energy deficits do not differ
between men and women. These data support the impor-
tance of exercise for weight management in women to re-
duce the compensatory responses to energy deficits achieved
solely via food restriction.
