ABSTRACT
Objective Previous studies on consumption of caffeine
and risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) have yielded
inconclusive results. We aimed to investigate whether
consumption of coffee is associated with risk of MS.
Methods Using two population-representative case–
control studies (a Swedish study comprising 1620 cases
and 2788 controls, and a US study comprising 1159
cases and 1172 controls), participants with different
habits of coffee consumption based on retrospective
data collection were compared regarding risk of MS, by
calculating ORs with 95% CIs. Logistic regression
models were adjusted for a broad range of potential
confounding factors.
Results Compared with those who reported no coffee
consumption, the risk of MS was substantially reduced
among those who reported a high consumption of
coffee exceeding 900 mL daily (OR 0.70 (95% CI 0.49
to 0.99) in the Swedish study, and OR 0.69 (95% CI
0.50 to 0.96) in the US study). Lower odds of MS with
increasing consumption of coffee were observed,
regardless of whether coffee consumption at disease
onset or 5 or 10 years prior to disease onset was
considered.
Conclusions In accordance with studies in animal
models of MS, high consumption of coffee may decrease
the risk of developing MS. Caffeine, one component of
coffee, has neuroprotective properties, and has been
shown to suppress the production of proinflammatory
cytokines, which may be mechanisms underlying the
observed association. However, further investigations are
needed to determine whether exposure to caffeine
underlies the observed association and, if so, to evaluate
its mechanisms of action.
BACKGROUND
Coffee contains more than a thousand biologically
active compounds of which caffeine, a stimulant of
the central nervous system, is the most studied
agent. Caffeine intake has been inversely associated
with cardiovascular disease,1 stroke2 and type 2
diabetes mellitus,3 and a recent dose–response
meta-analysis showed that coffee consumption was
associated with a decreased risk of mortality from
all causes and cardiovascular disease.4 5 In animal
models of Alzheimer’s disease, caffeine exerts pro-
tective effects at least in part by protecting against
blood–brain barrier leakage.6 By upregulation of
adenosine A1 receptors, consumption of caffeine
attenuates neuroinflammation and demyelination in
animal models of MS.7–9 The relationship between
consumption of caffeine and risk of MS has been
investigated in several case–control studies that gen-
erated inconsistent results,10–12 while one prospect-
ive study found no apparent association.13 Using
data from two large case–control studies, we aimed
to investigate whether consumption of coffee is
associated with risk of MS.
METHODS
Design and study population
The present report was based on data from two
case–control studies of environmental and genetic
risk factors for MS. The first study is EIMS
(Epidemiological
Investigation
of
Multiple
Sclerosis) with a study base comprising the Swedish
population aged 16–70 years. Potential incident
cases of MS, including those with clinically isolated
syndrome, were recruited via 40 study centres,
including all university hospitals in Sweden. All
cases were examined and diagnosed by a neurolo-
gist located at the unit where the case was entered.
The
treating
neurologist
provided
information
regarding
the
patient’s
onset
of
disease,
and
whether the patient fulfilled the McDonald cri-
teria.14 For each potential case, two controls were
randomly selected from the national population
register, matched by age in 5-year strata, sex and
residential
area.
Only
cases
that
fulfilled
the
McDonald criteria were included in the analyses.
Cases that did not fulfil the criteria at the time of
this report were excluded, but not their corre-
sponding controls. All aspects of the study were
approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board at
Karolinska Institutet.
The other case–control study recruited prevalent
cases
identified
among
members
of
Kaiser
Permanente
Medical
Care
Plan,
Northern
California Region (KPNC) using electronic health
records. KPNC is an integrated health services
delivery system with a membership of 3.3 million
that comprises about 25–30% of the population of
a 22-county service area in northern California.
Cases of MS, aged 18 years through 69 years, were
required to be current KPNC members who had
received
the
MS
diagnosis
by
a
neurologist.
Diagnoses were validated by chart review and radi-
ology
and
pharmacy
records,
according
to
McDonald criteria.15 The treating neurologist of
each potential MS case was contacted to gain
approval regarding contacting the case; potential

 cases who did not have MS, were deemed unable to participate
due to being too severely ill or impaired, or who were no
longer KPNC members, were thus excluded by their neurolo-
gists. Controls were randomly selected from KPNC members;
they did not have a diagnosis of MS or related conditions and
were individually matched to cases on sex, birth date, race/ethni-
city and zip code of the case residence. The study protocol was
approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the KP Division
of Research and the University of California, Berkeley. Details
of the research resource have been described elsewhere.15
Data collection
In EIMS, information on lifestyle factors and different expo-
sures was collected using a standardised questionnaire given to
the cases shortly after they had received their diagnosis, and was
sent by mail to the controls. During the study period (April
2005 to March 2013), completed questionnaires were obtained
from 2055 cases who fulfilled the McDonald criteria,13 and
from 4518 matched controls, which is equivalent to 93% of
invited cases and 73% of invited controls. In November 2013,
complementary questions were sent to all participants who had
answered the standardised questionnaire during the aforemen-
tioned period. Among other questions, participants were asked
to report their coffee consumption during different age periods
by asking ‘How many cups of coffee did you usually drink per
day when you were 15–19, 20–29, 30–39 and 40+ years old?’.
For each age period, the answer options were 0, 1–3, 3–4, 5–6,
7–8 and 8 or more cups of coffee daily. Those who reported 7–
8 or 8 or more cups of coffee daily were combined into one cat-
egory since few participants consumed more than 8 cups of
coffee daily. The complementary questions were answered by
82% of the cases and 66% of the controls. Information regard-
ing coffee consumption was missing for 57 cases and 166 con-
trols, and these individuals were excluded. Cases younger than
15 years of age at disease onset and their corresponding controls
were also excluded. The present study is thus comprised of
1620 cases and 2788 controls.
In the KPNC study, participants completed a computer-
assisted telephone interview at study entry administered by
trained staff regarding lifestyle factors and various exposures;
recruitment began in mid-2007. As of a recent data freeze in
August 2014, the study included a total of 1479 cases and 1185
controls. Within this data set, there were 1163 cases and 1178
matched controls. The study participation proportions were
approximately 80% for cases and 66% for controls. Information
on consumption habits of caffeinated coffee was obtained by
asking participants ‘the highest number of servings per day they
have ever been consumed for 6 months or more’ (answer
options were 0, 1, 2–3 and 4 or more cups of caffeinated coffee
daily), and those who reported consuming one or more servings
of any caffeinated beverage were asked ‘to estimate at what age
they started drinking caffeine on a regular basis’. Information
regarding coffee consumption was missing for four cases and six
controls, and these individuals were excluded. The results based
on the KPNC study are thus comprised of 1159 cases and 1172
controls.
For each case in both studies, the year of the initial appear-
ance of symptoms indicative of MS was defined as the index
year. Coffee consumption was considered prior to the index
year in the cases and during the same period of time in the cor-
responding controls. Participants from both data sets were cate-
gorised into groups based on their daily consumption of coffee
(number of cups of coffee). The size of one cup of coffee varies
between the countries. In Sweden, one cup of coffee was
defined as 150 mL, whereas a cup of coffee was defined as
237 mL (8 oz) in the KPNC study.
Confounding factors and other covariates
All analyses in EIMS were adjusted for relevant demographic
factors as well as for factors previously associated with MS risk.
These factors included the design variables age, sex, residential
area, as well as ancestry, smoking habits (number of pack
years),16 exposure to passive smoking,17 sun exposure habits,18
and body mass index at age 20 years.19 20 Age was categorised
into the same eight intervals that were used in the matching pro-
cedure: 16–19, 20–24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, 40–45, 45–49
and 50–70 years of age. Assessment of ancestry was based on
whether the participant was born in Sweden or not, and
whether either of the participant’s parents had immigrated to
Sweden. A participant who was born in Sweden and whose
parents had not immigrated, was classified as Swedish. Smoking
was adjusted for by using a continuous variable (pack years of
smoking). Exposure to passive smoking was dichotomised into
ever-exposed or never-exposed before the index year. On the
basis of three questions regarding ultraviolet radiation (UVR)
exposure where each answer option was given a number ranging
from 1 (the lowest exposure) to 4 (the highest exposure), we
constructed an index by adding the numbers together, and thus,
acquired a value between 3 and 12. UVR exposure was adjusted
for as a continuous variable. Body mass index at age 20 years
was calculated by dividing self-reported weight in kilograms by
self-reported height in metres squared, and adjusted for as a
continuous variable.
Additional covariates included educational level (compulsory
school, vocational upper secondary school, theoretical upper
secondary
school,
other
education
and
university),
socio-
economic status (skilled and unskilled workers, assistant, inter-
mediate,
and
higher
non-manual
employees),
alcohol
consumption at inclusion in the study (yes or no), a history of
infectious mononucleosis (yes or no) and HLA-DRB1*15 status
(positive or negative), but these factors did not significantly
influence the association between coffee consumption and MS
and were not retained in the final models.
In the KPNC study, sex, birth date, race/ethnicity and zip
code of the case residence were taken into consideration by
matched analysis. Adjustment was made for similar potential
confounders as in the EIMS study, including smoking habits,
passive smoking, sun exposure habits and body mass index in
one’s 20s21 (average of self-reported highest and lowest non-
pregnancy weight during one’s 20s, divided by self-reported
height in metres squared at the time of interview). Smoking was
dichotomised into ever-smokers and never-smokers before the
index year. Exposure to passive smoking was dichotomised into
those who had and had not been exposed to passive smoking
after the age of 18 years.
Sun exposure was dichotomised into high exposure (always
or almost always sunbathed in the summer at the age of
10 years), and low exposure (sometimes, rarely or never sun-
bathed in the summer at the age of 10 years). Body mass index
in one’s 20s was entered as a continuous variable. Adjustments
were also made for educational level (college or no college edu-
cation, or unknown), a history of infectious mononucleosis
(yes, no or unknown), and HLA-DRB1*15 status (positive,
negative, or unknown), but these factors had only minor influ-
ence on the results. Similar to analyses for EIMS, these factors
were not retained in the final models as there was no significant
change in the association of coffee consumption and the odds
of MS.

 Statistical analysis
Using logistic regression, the occurrence of MS among partici-
pants with different coffee consumption habits was compared
with those who never drank coffee, by calculating ORs with
95% CIs. In EIMS, we investigated the influence of coffee con-
sumption at the index year, and 5 and 10 years prior to the
index year. W
e performed both matched and unmatched ana-
lyses of EIMS. In the unmatched analysis we were able to
include a higher number of controls, and therefore had
increased statistical power. Only the results from the unmatched
analyses are presented in this report since these were in close
agreement with those from the matched analyses but had tighter
CIs. A trend test for a dose–response relationship regarding
coffee consumption and risk of MS was performed by using a
numerical integer variable for coffee consumption, ranging from
0 to 4 in EIMS, and 0 to 2 in KPNC.
In KPNC, we investigated the influence of coffee consumption
at the index year, and 5 years prior to the index year, using condi-
tional logistic regression. W
e assumed that consumption of coffee
began at the age the subjects first began consuming caffeinated
beverages. For each individual, the reported highest number of
servings per day that coffee had ever been consumed for
6 months or more was considered to represent typical consump-
tion during the whole period of regular coffee consumption. A
trend test for a dose–response relationship regarding coffee con-
sumption and risk of MS was performed by using a numerical
variable for coffee consumption ranging from 0 to 2. To differen-
tiate if results were related to an overall effect of caffeine or were
likely attributable to coffee intake specifically, we also conducted
analyses based on servings of tea and soda separately, using the
same assumptions as we did for coffee for ‘consumption before
onset’. This analysis was performed on KPNC data only. Data on
non-caffeinated beverages were neither collected for the KPNC
study participants nor for the EIMS participants. In Sweden, con-
sumption of non-caffeinated beverages is rare.
W
e also conducted a meta-analysis in which the results of the
two case–control studies were combined by calculating a
weighted
average
of
the
two
study-specific
adjusted
ORs
(weights were proportional to the inverse of the variance for
each OR). All analyses were conducted using Statistical Analysis
System (SAS) V
.9.2.
RESULTS
In the EIMS and KPNC cohorts, coffee consumption was asso-
ciated with sex, smoking, passive smoking and adolescent body
mass index among both cases and controls. Characteristics of
cases and controls, by the amount of daily coffee consumption
at the index year, are presented in table 1.
In EIMS, coffee consumption, both during the index year or 5
or 10 years prior to the index year, was associated with reduced
odds of developing MS as compared with participants who
reported no coffee consumption. The adjusted OR was 0.70
(95% CI 0.49 to 0.99, p=0.04) among those who drank more
than six cups of coffee (more than 900 mL) daily at the index
year. The corresponding OR for those who reported high coffee
consumption 5 or 10 years prior to the index year were 0.72
(95% CI 0.51 to 1.03, p=0.08) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.06,
p=0.09), respectively (table 2). Similar results were observed in
the KPNC study. Among those who had started drinking coffee
at any point before the index year and consumed four or more
cups of coffee (more than 948 mL) daily, the OR of developing
MS was 0.69 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.96, p=0.05) compared with
those who never drank coffee. Similarly, drinking four or more
cups of coffee daily at least 5 years prior to the index year was
associated with reduced odds of developing MS (OR 0.64, 95%
CI 0.45 to 0.91, p=0.04) (table 2). No evidence for association
was observed between increasing amounts of tea or soda intake
and
MS.
Dose–response
relationships
were
observed
that
showed reduced odds of MS with increasing coffee consumption
(table 2). When results from both studies were combined in
meta-analysis, the OR was 0.71 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.92) when
participants with the highest consumption of coffee (>900 mL
of coffee daily in the Swedish study and >948 mL of coffee
daily in the US study) were compared with participants who
never drank coffee. The corresponding OR was similar when
the analysis was stratified by smoking status (OR 0.72 (95% CI
0.45 to 1.13) among never-smokers and OR 0.65 (95% CI 0.44
to 0.96) among ever smokers).
DISCUSSION
Compared with participants who reported no coffee consump-
tion, the odds of MS were reduced among those who reported
high coffee consumption. These results are in line with similar
observations in studies using animal models of MS.7 These
results are also interesting in light of the fact that coffee and caf-
feine have both been associated with a reduced risk of
Parkinson’s disease.22 23 There are several potential mechanisms
by which coffee consumption may be important in MS. By
upregulation of adenosine 1A receptors, caffeine treatment
exerts a protective effect against experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis.7 8 Furthermore, in vitro caffeine treatment
of human monocytoid cells increased the expression of adeno-
sine 1A receptors and reduced proinflammatory cytokine pro-
duction.6 Coffee consumption has also been associated with
reduced
progression
of
disability
in
relapsing
onset
MS,
although this study was cross-sectional, and a causal relationship
could not be confirmed.24
The relationship between caffeine consumption and MS risk
has been investigated in several studies that generated inconsist-
ent results.10–13 In a case–control study comprising 93 cases and
186 controls of which 92 were hospital controls and 94 popula-
tion controls, an increased risk of MS was observed among sub-
jects who consumed coffee before age 15 years, where no
association was found between risk of MS and coffee intake after
age 15 years.10 A hospital-based, case–control study using 210
incident cases and 210 individually matched controls observed
an increased risk of MS with increasing coffee intake.11 An
inverse association between different eating patterns, which
included coffee, was observed in a case–control study comprising
75 cases and 75 controls recruited from the case’s relatives, or
matched for age, economic and educational levels.12 Coffee con-
sumption was not investigated separately in this study, however.
The only prospective cohort study (Nurses’ Health Study, NHS)
that has been carried out found no association between caffeine
intake and MS risk.13 It is possible that the much smaller
number of MS cases present in the NHS study (n=282, of
whom only 44 drank three or more cups of coffee daily, (ie, the
highest exposure category in NHS drank less than those in the
highest category of the present investigation) or other differences
in the patient populations (eg, inclusion of only female nurses in
this cohort) explains the discrepancy in findings.
Both case–control studies used in our analyses have some lim-
itations. Since information on exposure was gathered retrospect-
ively, recall bias may be a concern, and given the lack of
validated instruments, misclassification bias may also have
occurred. However, the relationship between coffee consump-
tion and MS risk had not been investigated until recently, and
since the results of previous studies have been inconsistent, the

 quality of the reported information on habits of coffee con-
sumption would probably not differ between cases and controls
due to different perceptions on potential effects from coffee
consumption, and misclassification would likely have been non-
differential, thus biasing towards the null (when comparing the
category of highest exposure with the unexposed). While a
potential selection bias may result from the relatively high pro-
portion of non-responders among the controls who answered
the complementary questions in EIMS, this bias is probably
modest because lifestyle habits such as the prevalence of
smoking and the pattern of alcohol consumption among the
controls who responded were consistent with that expected for
the general population in similar ages.25 Furthermore, there
were no significant differences in lifestyle habits (smoking,
passive smoking, BMI and sun exposure) between those who
answered the complementary questions and those who did not,
indicating that selection did not take place in this step. The pos-
sibility that the inverse relationship between coffee consumption
and risk of MS might be due to reverse causation seems less
likely since higher consumption of coffee was associated with
decreased odds of MS even several years prior to the index year,
as observed in EIMS. Further, there were no significant changes
in habits of coffee consumption among cases or controls during
the decade preceding the index year in the Swedish data. The
correlation between coffee consumption at index and 5 years
prior to index was 0.9 (p<0.0001), for cases and controls. The
corresponding correlation between coffee consumption and
10 years prior to index was 0.8 (p<0.0001; see also table 1).
The same was assumed to be true in the KPNC cohort for this
investigation. However, the possibility remains that under-
reporting of coffee intake prior to onset by MS cases, occurred
and led to an overestimate of the strength of the association, a
risk that may be higher in the KPNC cohort due to the longer
disease duration at the time of the study. Given the delay
between diagnosis of MS and data collection in both data sets
and, for KPNC, the adoption of the highest ever exposure as
representing pre-MS exposure, the possibility of reverse caus-
ation cannot entirely be ruled out. Additional limitations in the
KPNC cohort are that the amount consumed was assumed to be
consistent over time and that coffee consumption was assumed
to have begun at the age the participants first began consuming
caffeinated beverages. However, using a similar method with the
same assumptions as for evaluating coffee, there was no appar-
ent evidence of an association between greater consumption of
tea or soda intake and reduced odds of MS. Finally, while we
carefully adjusted for putative confounders in both case–control
studies, the possibility of residual confounding remains, as is
true of any study.
The main analysis based on EIMS was performed by uncondi-
tional logistic regression (adjusted for the matching factors) in
order to maximise the number of controls that could be
included in the analysis and, thereby, increase the precision of
our effect estimates. The rationale for doing so is that cases that
did not fulfil McDonald criteria at the time of this report were
excluded, but their corresponding controls were not. Further,
since information on coffee consumption was collected by com-
plementary questions sent out in 2013, non-response made
some triplets without a case or without controls. However, we
also performed conditional analyses, and the estimated ORs
were in close agreement with those from the unconditional ana-
lysis (OR 0.73 in the conditional vs OR 0.70 in the uncondi-
tional analysis).
The study also has a number of strengths. The careful recruit-
ment of cases and controls from the same reference population
in both cohorts mitigates concern that apparent associations are
due to anything other than case or control status. Further, our
analytical models were adjusted for a large number of potential
confounding factors, including currently established environ-
mental risk factors for MS.
In conclusion, we observed a significant association between
high consumption of coffee and decreased risk of developing
MS. Further studies are required to establish if it is in fact caf-
feine, or if there is another molecule in coffee underlying the
findings, to longitudinally assess the association between con-
sumption of coffee and disease activity in MS, and to evaluate
the mechanisms by which coffee may be acting, which could
thus lead to new therapeutic targets.
