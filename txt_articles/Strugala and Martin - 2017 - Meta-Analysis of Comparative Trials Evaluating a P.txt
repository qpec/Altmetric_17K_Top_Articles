 Meta-Analysis of Comparative Trials Evaluating
a Prophylactic Single-Use Negative Pressure Wound
Therapy System for the Prevention
of Surgical Site Complications
Vicki Strugala and Robin Martin
Abstract
Background: We report the first meta-analysis on the impact of prophylactic use of a specific design of negative
pressure wound therapy (NPWT) device on surgical site complications.
Methods: Articles were identified in which the specific single-use NPWT device (PICO), Smith & Nephew)
was compared with standard care for surgical site infection (SSI), dehiscence, or length of stay (LOS). Risk
ratio (RR) –95% confidence interval (CI) (SSI; dehiscence) or mean difference in LOS –95% CI was calculated
using RevMan v5.3.
Results: There were 1863 patients (2202 incisions) represented by 16 articles. Among 10 randomized studies,
there was a significant reduction in SSI rate of 51% from 9.7% to 4.8% with NPWT intervention (RR 0.49 [95%
CI 0.34–0.69] p < 0.0001). There were six observational studies assessing reduction in SSI rate of 67% from
22.5% to 7.4% with NPWT (RR 0. 32 [95% CI 0.18–0.55] p < 0.0001). Combining all 16 studies, there was a
significant reduction in SSI of 58% from 12.5% to 5.2% with NPWT (RR 0.43 [95% CI 0.32–0.57] p < 0.0001).
Similar effects were seen irrespective of the kind of surgery (orthopedic, abdominal, colorectal, or cesarean
section), although the numbers needed to treat (NNT) were lower in operations with higher frequencies of
complications. There was a significant reduction in dehiscence from 17.4% to 12.8% with NPWT (RR 0.71
[95% CI 0.54–0.92] p < 0.01). The mean reduction in hospital LOS by NPWT was also significant (-0.47 days
[95% CI -0.71 to -0.23] p < 0.0001).
Conclusions: The significantreductioninSSI,wounddehiscence,andLOSonthebasisofpooleddatafrom16studies
shows a benefit of the PICO single-use NPWT system compared with standard care in closed surgical incisions.

mproving outcomes for patients undergoing surgical
procedures by reducing rates of surgical site complications
(SSC) could have a significant impact on patients’ lives and
societal and healthcare costs [1]. Complications that may
affect closed surgical incisions and ultimately delay healing
include surgical site infection (SSI), dehiscence, seroma, and
hematoma, and these may result in poor quality or abnormal
scar formation. The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC) definitions of SSIs are widely used for sur-
veillance and research purposes. They classify SSIs as
superficial incisional, deep incisional, or organ/space and are
applicable to all types of operations [2].
Prevention of SSCs is complex because of the interactions
of patient-related, environmental, and surgical factors that
may be involved. Risk factors may occur at multiple points
during the pre-operative, operative, and post-operative phases

 of surgical procedures. Efforts to reduce SSI often include a
limited number of selected interventions that are grouped
together in a ‘‘care bundle’’ [3], but compliance with a care
bundle is not assured [4].
Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is emerging as
a promising technology as a preventative intervention and is
beginning to be advocated within care bundles in a variety of
closed surgical incisions to reduce SSC and specifically SSI
[1,5–7]. The mode of action of NPWT on a closed surgical
incision is notably different from the mode of action in open
wounds. The combined effects of reduced lateral tension,
improved lymphatic clearance, and reduction in hematoma
and seroma, as demonstrated in studies of NPWT on closed
surgical incisions, may contribute to faster and stronger
healing with reduced risk of infection and dehiscence [6].
Although conventional wisdom might suggest that the
NPWT dressing should be targeted just to the sutured inci-
sion, there is a developing awareness that the lateral extent of
operation may be important and that application of NPWT
across a wider surface area (‘‘the zone of injury’’) may be a
better clinical strategy [1,6,8], because NPWT can act to
reduce: edema, excess interstitial fluid, and venous stasis and
improve the general condition of the adjacent tissue [9–11].
There is a growing body of clinical evidence in which pro-
phylactic NPWT has been investigated to reduce the risk of
SSC in controlled studies, and a number of meta-analysis have
been performed on this data [5,12–16]. It must be stressed that
these previous meta-analyses include a diverse mix of tradi-
tional NPWT and single-use NPWT devices operating at
varying levels of negative pressure and mixed surgical indi-
cations,which mayintroduce heterogeneity intometa-analysis.
Aim
We report the first meta-analysis on SSC occurrence using
a specific single-use or disposable NPWT device (PICO)
single-use NPWT system, Smith & Nephew, Hull, UK) that
operates only at -80 mm Hg with the aim of reducing two key
variables that are responsible for heterogeneity when differ-
ent devices are combined. The influence of this specific
NPWT device on the rate of SSI, dehiscence, and length of
stay (LOS) has been analyzed in comparison with standard
care across a number of surgical indications. Disposable or
single-use NPWT devices are particularly attractive for pre-
ventative use [6]. Figure 1 shows the PICO device in use.
Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis is reported in
accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [17].
Eligibility criteria
All known clinical studies comparing single-use NPWT with
standardcare(anynon-NPWTdressing)appliedpost-operatively
on a closed surgical incision were included. The intervention was
required to be the PICO single-use NPWT system, which is a
small canister-free device that deals with exudate by absorption
and evaporation using a unique dressing technology. It delivers
-80mm Hg negative pressure (nominal) for seven days.
Participants of any age and undergoing any type of oper-
ation were eligible. There were no restrictions on the inclu-
sion or exclusion criteria with regard to risk factors for
complications. Studies had to report either SSI with at least
21 days follow-up, wound dehiscence occurrence, or the LOS
(days). Eligible clinical studies could be randomized con-
trolled trials (RCT), retrospective or prospective observa-
tional studies, and be of any sample size. No publication
restrictions were imposed. Published abstracts or PhD thesis
with sufficient information to extract mean and variance data
were included. No valid study was excluded. Studies that
were not in English, participants were not human, or case
reports, case-series, letters, commentaries, notes, or editorials
were excluded. Whenever multiple publications of the same
data existed, only the most inclusive, comprehensive, and
recent one was included.

META-ANALYSIS OF SINGLE-USE NPWT ON SSC
811
 This systematic review and meta-analysis were based on
that PICO) database and search terms listed from 2011 up to
March 31, 2017. Review of the publications that met the
eligibility criteria was performed by two independent re-
viewers (VS and RM).
Data extraction
Data were extracted on the number of patients (or more
precisely, the number of incisions), type of surgical proce-
dure, duration of prophylactic NPWT, clinical end-points,
and frequency of those outcomes (SSI or dehiscence). The
mean (– SD [standard deviation]) LOS was also extracted (or
derived by calculation from other reported averages and
variance). The type of study was noted as either RCT (in-
cluding interim or pilot) or observational for non-randomized
comparative studies.
Data analysis
Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effects model
in Review Manager (RevMan) software Version 5.3. (Co-
penhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane
Collaboration, 2014). Dichotomous data were analyzed using
Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) [18] to calculate risk ratio (RR)
–95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, mean
(SD) was entered and was analyzed by Inverse Variance to
calculate mean difference –95% CI. Level of heterogeneity
across studies was noted by the I2 statistic, and random ef-
fects meta-analyses modeling was also reported [19].
For the SSI studies, the data were analyzed as (1) RCTs
only, (2) observational studies only, (3) all studies combined
(overall). Subgroup meta-analyses stratified by type of sur-
gical procedure were performed subsequently. Number nee-
ded to treat (NNT) to avoid a complication was calculated.
Data are presented as forest plots, and study bias evaluation
was presented as a funnel plot.
Results
Study selection
On the basis of a review of a comprehensive database of 64
articles, 88 posters/abstracts, and one PhD thesis, we selected
26 articles for full text review (Fig. 2 shows the flow chart of
the selection of articles for the meta-analysis). After exclu-
sion of eight articles [20–27], finally 18 articles in which
PICO was compared with standard care were used in the
final qualitative review [8,28–44]. Two articles did not go
on to the quantitative meta-analysis because of the SSC end-
points not meeting the selection criteria for analysis [8,37].
One article described two separate patient populations
(breast and colorectal surgery) that were assessed and ana-
lyzed separately [40].
Study characteristics
All studies used the PICO single-use NPWT system. In the
quantitative meta-analysis, there were 16 articles (1863 pa-
tients) comprising 10 RCTs reported in 10 articles (including
1734 incisions) and seven observational studies reported in

each included study are displayed in Table 1.
Synthesis of results
SSI.
The rate of SSI was reported in 15 articles re-
presenting 16 studies and 1839 patients and comprising 2154
incisions [28–33,35,36,38–44]; the summary statistics of the
analysis are shown in Table 2.
On the basis of the 10 RCTs of varying patient numbers,
there was a significant reduction in the relative risk of SSI
with PICO) treatment compared with standard care from
9.7% to 4.8%, which represents an absolute reduction of
4.9% and a relative reduction of 51% (fixed effects RR 0.49
[95% CI 0.34–0.69] p < 0.00001).
In comparison, there were six studies that assessed the SSI
rate with non-randomized observational methodology, and
these also noted a significant reduction in relative risk of SSI
with PICO treatment compared with standard care—22.5%
to 7.4%—which is a 15.1% absolute reduction and 67%
relative reduction (fixed effects RR 0.32 [95% CI 0.18–055]
p < 0.00001).
Overall, combining RCT and observational studies, the
rate of SSI was 5.2% (54/1037) with PICO single-use NPWT
treatment compared with 12.5% (140/1117) in the standard
care group equating to an absolute reduction of 7.3% and a
relative reduction of 58% (fixed effects RR 0.43 [95% CI
0.32–0.57] p < 0.0001).
The details of each individual study and the RCT, obser-
vation, and overall data analysis (as a forest plot) are shown
in Figure 3. The optimum estimate of the effect was obtained
using the strong RCT evidence because there were more
studies.
A subgroup analysis was performed on the basis of in-
dividual surgical specialities if three or more studies ex-
isted (Table 3). Significant reductions in SSI risk compared
with standard care was seen in orthopedic surgical proce-
dures (RR 0.48 [95% CI 0.25–0.94] p = 0.03), abdominal
operations (RR 0.44 [95% CI 0.30–0.64] p < 0.0001), co-
lorectal surgical procedures (RR 0.29 [95% CI 0.15–0.57]
p = 0.0004), and cesarean section (RR 0.53 [95% CI 0.33–
0.84] p = 0.007). The degree of relative reduction in the SSI
rate was similar (49%–71%) irrespective of the inherent
SSI rate of the surgical procedure; however, the NNT is

Dehiscence.
Rate of wound dehiscence was reported in
six articles and 1068 patients, comprising 1291 incisions
[28,30,31,34,35,44]. The rate of dehiscence was 12.8%
(78/611) with PICO single-use NPWT treatment compared
with 17.4% (118/680) in the standard care group (Table 2)
relating to an absolute reduction of 4.6% and a relative
reduction of 26.4%. There was a significant reduction in
the relative risk of dehiscence with PICO treatment com-
pared with standard care (fixed effects RR 0.71 [95% CI
0.54–0.92] p = 0.01). The details of each individual study
and the overall data analysis (as a forest plot) are shown in
Figure 4.
LOS.
The LOS was reported in eight studies representing
725 patients [28,29,31,36,39–41]. There was a significant
mean difference in LOS from PICO single-use NPWT
treatment compared with standard care (-0.47 days [95% CI
-0.71 to -0.23] p < 0.0001). The detail of each individual
study and the overall data and subgroup analysis (as a forest
plot) is shown in Figure 5. A subgroup analysis was per-
formed on the basis of surgical speciality, and mean differ-
ence in LOS was -5.1 days in colorectal/laparotomy surgical
procedures [39–41] but only -0.1 days in all other operations
[28,29,31,36,40].
Publication bias
An assessment of the publication bias on the basis of the 15
articles included for an SSI outcome is shown in the funnel
plot (Fig. 6). The distribution of studies is symmetric, sug-
gesting no publication bias. because both large and small
(pilot/ feasibility) studies regardless of the outcome are being
published.

META-ANALYSIS OF SINGLE-USE NPWT ON SSC
815
 Discussion
On the basis of 16 published clinical papers in which the
PICO single-use NPWT device was compared with standard
care, there was a clear and significant benefit in favor of
prophylactic NPWT to reduce SSI, wound dehiscence, and
LOS when the device was applied on a closed surgical inci-
sion. The SSCs may delay healing and result in considerable
morbidity, death, and socioeconomic costs, and up to 60% are
considered to be preventable [1]. There is now also an ar-
gument that SSC, and SSI in particular, could have a detri-
mental effect on oncologic survival [45–47]. The PICO
single-use NPWT is shown to be an intervention that reduces
SSC and therefore the socioeconomic sequelae.
This is the first comprehensive meta-analysis that has as-
sessed the impact of a specific design of NPWT system on
SSCs. By limiting the meta-analysis to a single brand of
NPWT with a fixed level of negative pressure (-80 mm Hg),
some heterogeneity was reduced. There still remains a het-
erogeneous mix of surgical indications and patient profiles
but the sub-group analysis confirms that the benefit of PICO
on SSI remains with stratification. On the basis of the I2
statistic, it confirms the homogenous study population and
strengthens the conclusions that can be made (I2 = 9% for 10
RCTs, 0% for six observational studies, and 7% for the
combined 16 studies). Other reviews and meta-analyses have
included a diverse mix of traditional NPWT and single-use
NPWT devices, varying levels of negative pressure, and
varying materials/fillers. There was also calculation of an
effect on dehiscence again with a homogenous study popu-
lation (I2 = 0%). On the basis of a higher level of heteroge-
neity in the LOS data (I2 = 94% when 8 studies combined),
however, the conclusions for this specific analysis need to be
downgraded but show it is worth investigating LOS further.
De Vries et al [15] published recently the supporting meta-
analysis data for prophylactic use of NPWT on SSI risk as
part of the World Health Organization recommendations for
SSI prevention [7]. They stratified their meta-analysis by RCT
and also by comparative observational studies, like our study.
They reviewed six RCTs and reported a reduction in SSI with
RR 0.56. Their observational study analysis comprised 15
studies, and they noted decrease in SSI rate with RR 0.29.
The PICO-only data in this present analysis confirm that
this specific design operating at -80 mm Hg is proven to
reduce the incidence of SSI across several surgical indica-
tions. This echoes the W.H.O. conditional recommendations
that suggest the use of prophylactic NPWT on primarily
closed surgical incisions in high-risk wounds for the purpose
of preventing SSI, taking resources into account [7]. It also
supports consensus findings that advocate the prophylactic
use of NPWT on closed surgical incisions when either patient
or procedure risk factors exist [1].
To support the widespread adoption of the use of pro-
phylactic NPWT, of course there needs to be supporting
health economic evidence to show that investing in preven-
tion delivers a net benefit for patients and healthcare systems.

STRUGALA AND MARTIN
 These studies are now emerging [27,48]. At an approximate
cost of $225 for a week of preventative NPWT (April 2017)
and modest numbers for NNT, PICO single-use NPWT may
prove to be a cost-effective tool in the reduction of surgical
complications.
This is a fast moving field. Even with this specific design
of single-use NPWT device, new studies are being pub-
lished regularly, and there are many studies ongoing as
noted by published protocols [49–52] or listing on public
registries, such as clinicaltrials.gov. Evidence is broader
for SSI than for dehiscence or LOS, and it has not yet been
possible to individually analyze for superficial, deep, or
organ space SSI.
Conclusion
This is the first comprehensive meta-analysis that has as-
sessed the benefit of a specific brand of single-use NPWT on
SSCs. It showed a clear and significant reduction in SSIs,
wound dehiscence, and LOS by application of the PICO
single-use NPWT system used prophylactically on a closed
surgical incision when compared with standard care.
