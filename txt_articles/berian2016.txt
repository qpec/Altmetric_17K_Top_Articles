IMPORTANCE Older adults are at increased risk for adverse events after surgical procedures.
Loss of independence (LOI), defined as a decline in function or mobility, increased care needs
at home, or discharge to a nonhome destination, is an important patient-centered outcome
measure.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate LOI among older adult patients after surgical procedures and examine
the association of LOI with readmission and death after discharge in this population.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study examined 9972
patients 65 years and older with known baseline function, mobility, and living situation
undergoing inpatient operations from January 2014 to December 2014 at 26 hospitals
participating in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement
Program Geriatric Surgery Pilot Project. A total of 4895 patients were excluded because they
were totally dependent, classified as class 5 by the American Society of Anesthesiologists,
undergoing orthopedic or spinal procedures, or died prior to discharge.
EXPOSURES Loss of independence at time of discharge.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Readmission and death after discharge.
RESULTS Of the 5077 patients included in this study, 2736 (53.9%) were female and 3876
(76.3%) were white, with a mean (SD) age of 75 (7) years. For this cohort, LOI increased with
age; LOI occurred in 1386 of 2780 patients (49.9%) aged 65 to 74 years, 1162 of 1726 (67.3%)
aged 75 to 84 years, and 479 of 571 (83.9%) 85 years and older (P < .001). Readmission
occurred in 517 patients (10.2%). In a risk-adjusted model, LOI was strongly associated with
readmission (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.4-2.2) and postoperative complication (odds ratio, 6.7;
95% CI, 4.9-9.0). Death after discharge occurred in 69 patients (1.4%). After risk adjustment,
LOI was the strongest factor associated with death after discharge (odds ratio, 6.7; 95% CI,
2.4-19.3). Postoperative complication was not significantly associated with death after
discharge.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Loss of independence, a patient-centered outcome, was
associated with postoperative readmissions and death after discharge. Loss of independence
can feasibly be collected across multiple hospitals in a national registry. Clinical initiatives to
minimize LOI will be important for improving surgical care for older adults.

W
ith the aging of the population, an increased de-
mand on surgical services can be anticipated. Ac-
cording to the US Census Bureau, people 65 years
and older constituted 13.0% of the population in 2010.1 In the
same year, people 65 years and older underwent 37.4% of all
inpatient procedures, which totaled 19.2 million procedures.2
Older adults undergoing surgical procedures are at increased
risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality3 and may pri-
oritize quality over quantity of life years. Among older adults
with life-threatening illnesses, one study4 found that most pa-
tients would decline life-saving interventions if it resulted in
significant functional or cognitive impairment (74.4% and
88.8%, respectively).
Patient-centered care requires that clinicians pay atten-
tion to outcomes that matter most to patients. Loss of the abil-
itytoliveindependentlyisahigh-prioritypatient-centeredout-
come. In the current study, loss of independence (LOI) is
defined as 1 of 3 changes: a decline in function according to
activities of daily living (ADLs), a decline in mobility requir-
ing new mobility aid, or an increase in care needs, such as the
need for new home-care services or discharge to a nonhome
destination. Loss of independence is a novel intermediate out-
come (ie, occurring in the early postoperative period). These
elements correspond to a conceptual framework known as the
Disablement Process, in which multiple factors, such as sur-
gical procedures, the need for special equipment and de-
vices, lifestyle and behavioral changes, and the physical and
social environment, all influence a person’
s ability to func-
tionindependently.5Thisconceptualmodelhasbeenusedpre-
viously in the surgical literature by Lawrence et al6 in a longi-
tudinal evaluation of functional outcomes in older patients
after major abdominal surgical procedures.
Currently, quality metrics prioritized by hospitals and
medical professionals focus on discrete outcomes, such as re-
admission or mortality. This study hypothesized that LOI at
the time of discharge would be associated with readmission
and death after discharge. The objectives of the current study
were to evaluate LOI among older adults after surgical proce-
dures and to examine the association of LOI with readmis-
sion and death after discharge in this population.
Methods
Data Source
Data were obtained from the American College of Surgeons
(ACS)NationalSurgicalQualityImprovementProgram(NSQIP)
Geriatric Surgery Pilot Project. The ACS NSQIP has been de-
scribed previously.7-10 Briefly, it is a prospective, multi-
institutional clinical data registry that collects data on more
than 200 variables, including preoperative patient character-
istics, operative details, and postoperative events. A trained
abstractorcollectsdatafrommedicalrecordsusinghighlystan-
dardized data definitions; previous ACS data audits have in-
dicated high reliability.9
The Geriatric Surgery Pilot Project was developed by the
ACS Geriatric Surgery Task Force and the ACS NSQIP to cap-
ture more granular information valuable to older adults.11
Twenty-six NSQIP hospitals volunteered to collect a set of 14
geriatric-specific variables from 4 important domains: func-
tion, cognition, mobility, and decision making. The pilot data
were collected between January 2014 and December 2014. Be-
cause all data were collected from a deidentified database, in-
formed consent was waived, and the study is exempt from in-
stitutionalreviewboardoversightaccordingtotheChesapeake
Research Review Institutional Review Board.
Patient Population
Patients 65 years and older undergoing an inpatient opera-
tion at hospitals in the Geriatric Surgery Pilot Project who had
known ADLs, living situation, and mobility were included in
the cohort. Because LOI was assessed at the time of dis-
charge, patients who died prior to discharge were excluded.
Risk Factors and Outcomes
The ACS NSQIP collects data on preoperative demographic in-
formation and comorbidities, operative details, and postop-
erative events. Preoperative demographic information and co-
morbidities used in this analysis includes sex, age, American
SocietyofAnesthesiologists(ASA)classification,andbodymass
index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared). Preoperative functional status (indepen-
dence, partial dependence, or dependence for ADLs) is a stan-
dard variable collected for all NSQIP patients. The NSQIP Geri-
atricSurgeryPilotProjectcollects14geriatric-specificvariables,
including preoperative living situation (patient living at home
without support, living at home with support, or living in a fa-
cility), use of mobility aids, previous falls within 1 year, his-
tory of cognitive decline or dementia, functional status at time
of discharge, fall risk at time of discharge, postoperative use
ofmobilityaid,andhospitaldischargedestinationwithorwith-
out the need for additional services.
Additional variables used in this analysis include emer-
gency operation and a NSQIP composite measure for serious
postoperative complications. This measure calculates seri-
ous postoperative complication as 1 or more of the following
occurrences: cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, pneumo-
nia, progressive renal insufficiency, acute renal failure, deep
vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, a return to the op-
erating room, deep incisional surgical site infection, organ/
Key Points
Question How frequently do older adults experience loss of
independence (LOI) after surgical procedures, and is LOI
associated with poor outcomes of readmission and death after
discharge?
Findings In this cohort study of 5077 older adults after surgical
procedures, LOI occurred frequently and increased with age. After
risk adjustment, LOI was significantly associated with a 1.7-fold
increased risk for readmission and a 6.7-fold increased risk for
death after discharge.
Meaning Hospitals should consider tracking patient-centered
outcomes such as LOI, with the goal to intervene and minimize
poor outcomes after discharge.

space surgical site infection, systemic sepsis (sepsis or septic
shock),unplannedintubation,urinarytractinfection,orwound
disruption. Of note, the following were adjusted and not con-
sidered complications if identified prior to the operation: sur-
gical site infection, pneumonia, sepsis, progressive renal in-
sufficiency or acute renal failure, and urinary tract infection.
Loss of independence was assessed at the time of dis-
charge and was defined as a decline in functional status, mo-
bility, and/or care needs. Decline in functional status was mea-
sured by comparing preoperative with postoperative function
according to ADLs, which include bathing, dressing, groom-
ing, eating, toileting, and transferring. Patients who were pre-
operatively independent or partially dependent had a de-
cline in function if they became partially dependent or fully
dependent, respectively. Decline in mobility was estimated
using the requirement for a new mobility aid as a proxy. In-
creased care needs were assessed by discharge destination and
the need for additional support or skilled services in the home.
Livingsituationwascapturedpreoperatively(originfromhome
alone, home with support, or nonhome origin, ie, from facil-
ity) and postoperatively (discharge destination to home alone,
home with support or skilled services, or nonhome destina-
tion). Patients who were discharged to a nonhome destina-
tionorwhoneedednewsupportorskilledservicesinthehome
were considered to have increased care needs.
The main outcome measures for the study were readmis-
sion and death after discharge, both measured within 30 days
postoperatively. The ACS NSQIP collects date of discharge and
date of death, allowing for the calculation of mortality after
discharge or postdischarge death.
Statistical Analysis
Univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted with de-
scriptive statistics, χ2 tests, and t tests as appropriate. Multi-
variable regression models were developed using forward se-
lection. Missing data were evaluated and found to be missing
at random. Two variables were missing more than 5% of data
(fall history missing 12% and preoperative cognitive impair-
ment missing 9%). Missing data were handled with multiple
imputation, using the SAS fully conditional specification im-
putation algorithm (preferred because of predominantly cat-
egoricaldata).Toexceedthehighestpercentageofmissingdata,
15 imputed data sets were created. Variables included for im-
putation were those included in the final model: age, sex, body
mass index classification, ASA classification, race/ethnicity,
smoking status, preoperative living situation (origin), preop-
erative cognitive impairment, surrogate consent, fall history,
emergency status, serious postoperative complications, post-
operative loss of function or mobility or increased care needs,
readmission, and death after discharge. All statistical analy-
ses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
A total of 9972 eligible patients 65 years and older underwent
inpatient operations in 26 hospitals taking part in the ACS
NSQIP Geriatric Surgery Pilot Project between January 2014
and December 2014. The 100 patients who were totally de-
pendent in ADLs and the 16 classified as ASA class 5 (mori-
bund) were excluded. Because of the expected loss of mobil-
ityfollowingorthopedicorspinalprocedures,the4680patients
undergoing these operations were also excluded. Because LOI
was assessed at the time of discharge, the 99 patients who died
prior to the time of discharge were excluded. The final cohort
for analysis consisted of 5077 older adults.
The cohort included 2736 female patients (53.9%) with a
mean (SD) age of 75 (7) years who underwent a range of inpa-
tient operations. Most operations were general surgical pro-
cedures (2934 [57.8%]), followed by vascular surgical proce-
dures (965 [19.0%]), and urologic or gynecologic surgical
procedures(622[12.3%]),andtheremainderweresurgicalsub-
specialties. The group of patients experiencing LOI was sig-
nificantly older with more comorbid conditions and geriatric
risk factors (falls, weight loss, and cognitive impairment)
(Table 1). Patients with LOI experienced higher rates of seri-
ous complications after the procedure than patients without
LOI (5.2% vs 2.5%; P < .001) and stayed in the hospital longer
(mean [SD] length of stay, 7.3 [7.5] vs 3.3 [3.3] days; P < .001).
Loss of independence was defined as a decline in func-
tional status or mobility or increased care needs at the time of
discharge. A decline in functional status occurred in 1348 pa-
tients (26.6%), and a decline in mobility occurred in 1626
(32.0%)(Figure,A).Increasedcareneedswereobservedin2339
(46.0%), with 1414 (27.8%) requiring additional skilled or sup-
portive services at home and 925 (18.2%) requiring discharge
to a nonhome destination (Figure, A). Overall, 3027 (59.6%)
of the cohort experienced at least some degree of LOI (loss in
at least 1 domain), with 666 (13.1%) experiencing losses in all
3 domains (Figure, B). Loss of independence increased sig-
nificantly with age, occurring in 1386 of 2780 patients (49.9%)
aged 65 to 74 years, 1162 of 1726 (67.3%) aged 75 to 84 years,
and 479 of 571 (83.9%) 85 years and older (P < .001).
Factors associated with LOI were identified through mul-
tivariable regression with forward selection, controlling for the
preoperativepatientcharacteristicsidentifiedinTable1,aswell
as postoperative complication and length of stay. The stron-
gest factor associated with LOI was age of 85 years and older,
with an odds ratio (OR) of 4.4 (95% CI, 3.4-5.7) (Table 2). Hav-
ing experienced a fall in the year prior to the operation was also
strongly associated with LOI, with an OR of 2.4 (95% CI, 1.9-
3.0). Although serious postoperative complications were not
significant in the model, postoperative length of stay demon-
strated a significant association, with each day increasing risk
by 30% (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.3).
Readmission occurred in 517 patients (10.2%) from the co-
hort. A multivariable model with forward selection controlled

plication, and LOI. The model identified 4 risk factors
demonstrating a strong association with readmission. Loss of
independence exhibited the second strongest association with

nificant factors included an ASA class of 3 or 4 (OR, 1.4; 95%
CI, 1.1-1.7) and preoperative living situation with support in the
home (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7) (Table 3).
Deathafterdischargeoccurredin69patients(1.4%).Amul-
tivariable model with forward selection controlled for age,
emergency operation, unintentional weight loss (loss of ≥10%
body weight in prior 6 months), surrogate consent, preopera-
tive cognitive impairment, fall history within 1 year, serious
postoperative complication, and LOI. There were 4 signifi-
cant risk factors selected by the model. Loss of independence
demonstrated the strongest association with death after dis-
charge (OR, 6.7; 95% CI, 2.4-19.3). A surrogate decision maker
having signed the consent form was also strongly associated
with death after discharge (OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 3.4-10.5). Addi-
tional risk factors associated with death after discharge in-
cluded emergency operation (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.6) as well
as age of 75 to 84 years (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.6) and age of 85
years and older (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2-4.8) compared with pa-
tients aged 65 to 74 years. Serious postoperative complica-
tion was not significantly associated with death after dis-
charge and was not selected in the model (Table 4).
Discussion
The current study aimed to evaluate the association between
LOI, a novel and patient-centered outcome, and the discrete
end points of readmission and postdischarge death. Loss of in-
dependence encompasses several elements that influence in-
dependent living, including function in performing tasks nec-
essary for survival and personal care (ie, ADLs, such as eating
and toileting), use of aids to ambulate (mobility devices), and
physical and social environmental factors (home with sup-
port or skilled care vs nonhome environment). In this retro-
spective cohort study, 3027 older patients (59.6%) undergo-
ing surgical procedures experienced a decline in at least 1 of 3
domains—function, mobility, or home care needs—at the time
ofdischarge.Lossofindependenceincreasedsignificantlywith
age, with those 85 years and older at greatest risk.
After serious postoperative complication, LOI was the sec-
ond most important factor associated with readmission, in-
creasing the risk by 70%. Serious postoperative complica-
tions were most significantly associated with readmission,

increasing the risk by 6.7-fold. Complications may presum-
ably be directly associated with the indication for readmis-
sion. However, the significant association of readmission with
LOIandpreoperativesupportinthehomemaysuggestthecriti-
cal role of environment and patient resources in prompting re-
admission. When examining death after discharge, LOI was as-
sociated with a 6.7-fold increased risk. Additional significant
factors included surrogate-signed consent and emergency op-
erations, as well as advancing age. Postoperative complica-
tions were not significantly associated with death after dis-
charge. The need for a surrogate decision maker or an
emergency operation suggests that patients had cognitive or
psychological limitations or severe illness prior to an opera-
tion. Patients experiencing LOI were older and sicker; pa-
tients 85 years and older experienced a 4.4-fold increased risk
forLOIcomparedwithpatientsaged65to74years,whilethose
with a fall in the year prior to an operation had a 2.4-fold in-
creased risk for LOI. Certainly, older, sicker patients often have
a poorer prognosis, and this may help explain the increased
risk for death after discharge.
These findings may be best interpreted by considering the
literature on frailty, a phenotypic state of decreased physi-
ologic reserve not confined to chronological age.12 Patients ex-
periencing LOI in this study may have had underlying frailty
predisposing them to worse outcomes. This subset of vulner-
able patients are likely the same group that experience high
rates of LOI. Although rates of frailty vary widely when stud-
ied among surgical populations (10% to more than 50%), stud-
ies consistently demonstrate increased risks for poor postop-
erativeoutcomes(eg,infectiouscomplications,cardiacevents,
respiratory compromise, or death) among frail patients.13-15
Studies examining discharge to nonhome destinations have
identified that frailty significantly increases this risk, ranging
from a 1.5- to a 20-fold increase.13,16,17 Although frailty repre-
sents a critical prognostic factor, it is imperative to identify pa-
tient-centered outcomes, such as LOI, that may serve as tar-
getsforinterventionandrelevantmetricsforhigh-qualitycare.
Thedemandforsurgicaltherapyfromolderadultswillonly
increase in the coming decades. The association of LOI with
readmission and death after discharge should prompt in-
creased attention from physicians, hospital quality person-
nel, and administrators. Efforts to decrease LOI at the time of
discharge may potentially prevent readmission at a later time.
Multidisciplinary care with an emphasis on geriatric medi-
cine may provide benefits for surgical patients. Established
models of care (such as the Hospital Elder Life Program18) and
geriatric comanagement strategies focus on simple interven-
tions, such as frequent reorientation, hydration, and early
ambulation to prevent delirium, deconditioning, and
malnutrition.19,20 Length of stay was a significant risk factor
forLOI,witheachadditionalhospitaldayadding30%risk.Cer-
tainly, deconditioning over the hospital stay is a logical mecha-
nism that may explain LOI. The current study identified func-
tional decline among 1348 surgical inpatients (26.6%) 65 years
and older. This is consistent with literature that indicates most
functional loss occurs within the first week of surgical proce-
dures and may even persist up to 6 months later.6
Therapies to promote preservation of function and
mobility may minimize the detrimental effects of a hospital-
ization in vulnerable elderly patients. Recognition that LOI
carries an increased risk for readmission should prompt a
more detailed, personalized discharge plan. A 2013 Cochrane
database systematic review21 found that personalized,
detailed discharge planning improved transitions of care,
with a significant decrease in readmission rates and length of
stay. Attention to postoperative care needs may allow early
recognition of limited home resources or an overreliance on
family and friends for support. Caregiver burnout can occur
in chronic conditions and contribute to hospital readmission
and poor outcomes.22,23 The significant association of LOI
and support in the home preoperatively with risk of readmis-
sion in our study underscores the importance of evaluating
the patient’
s social support system. Further investigation
should examine mechanisms to prevent LOI and promote
care processes that facilitate successful transitions from the
hospital to the community.
This study has several limitations. First, the ACS NSQIP
Geriatric Surgery Pilot Project includes a subset of 26 NSQIP
hospitals, with voluntary participation. These hospitals and
their patients may represent a homogenous sample, poten-
tially limiting the generalizability of these findings. However,
it remains possible that LOI in a more heterogeneous sample,
with less awareness of geriatric-specific issues, may demon-
strate an even stronger association with readmission and post-
discharge death. Second, LOI at discharge, death after dis-
charge, and readmission within 30 days remain short-term
outcomes. Function, cognition, and mobility are dynamic,
long-term processes. The current study presents an assess-
ment of 1 patient-centered outcome at 1 time point; however,
future studies should include longitudinal assessments of pa-
tient-centered postoperative outcomes. Third, the current
study is retrospective in nature and cannot establish the cause

readmission within 30 days postoperatively were selected by forward selection.
The model is controlled for loss of independence, age, emergency operation,
unintentional weight loss (loss of �10% body weight in prior 6 months),
surrogate consent, preoperative cognitive impairment, fall history within 1 year,
and serious postoperative complication. Loss of independence is defined as a
loss in function, mobility, or care needs. Serious postoperative complication
included cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, progressive renal
insufficiency, acute renal failure, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism,
a return to the operating room, deep incisional surgical site infection,
organ/space surgical site infection, systemic sepsis (sepsis or septic shock),
unplanned intubation, urinary tract infection, and wound disruption.

study demonstrates that data on function, mobility, and care
needs can be feasibly collected in a multi-institutional, na-
tional data registry.
Conclusions
Loss of independence, as defined by decreases in function or
mobility or an increase in care needs, is associated with read-
mission and death after discharge. Patient-centered out-
comes such as LOI can, and should, be collected in multi-
institutionaldataregistries.Lossofindependenceisapotential
target for intervention, and future work should move beyond
its use as a factor for prognostication. To best serve the aging
population, clinical initiatives must focus on efforts to mini-
mize LOI and better understand its association with discrete
outcomes like readmission and death after discharge.
