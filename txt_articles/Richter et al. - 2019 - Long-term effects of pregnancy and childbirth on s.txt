Abstract
Study Objectives: To examine the changes in mothers’ and fathers’ sleep satisfaction and sleep duration across prepregnancy, pregnancy, and the 
postpartum period of up to 6 years after birth; it also sought to determine potential protective and risk factors for sleep during that time.
Methods: Participants in a large population-representative panel study from Germany reported sleep satisfaction and sleep duration in yearly 
interviews. During the observation period (2008–2015), 2541 women and 2118 men reported the birth of their first, second, or third child and provided 
longitudinal data for analysis. Fixed-effects regression models were used to analyze changes in sleep associated with childbirth.
Results: Sleep satisfaction and duration sharply declined with childbirth and reached a nadir during the first 3 months postpartum, with women more 
strongly affected (sleep satisfaction reduction compared with prepregnancy: women, 1.81 points on a 0 to 10 scale, d = 0.79 vs. men, 0.37 points, d = 0.16; 
sleep duration reduction compared with prepregnancy: women, 62 min, d = 0.90 vs. men, 13 min, d = 0.19). In both women and men, sleep satisfaction 
and duration did not fully recover for up to 6 years after the birth of their first child. Breastfeeding was associated with a slight decrease in maternal 
sleep satisfaction (0.72 points, d = 0.32) and duration (14 min, d = 0.21). Parental age, household income, and dual vs. single parenting were unrelated, or 
only very weakly related, to improved sleep.
Conclusions: Following the sharp decline in sleep satisfaction and duration in the first months postpartum, neither mothers’ nor fathers’ sleep fully 
recovers to prepregnancy levels up to 6 years after the birth of their first child.
Key words: pregnancy; childbirth; sleep satisfaction; sleep duration; postpartum; development
Statement of Significance
The costs of having children include drastic short-term consequences for maternal sleep, with a nadir in sleep satisfaction and duration 
during the first three postpartum months. After the first child, neither mothers’ nor fathers’ sleep satisfaction or duration fully recovers, 
even when their children reach preschool age (4–6 years postpartum). Sleep effects are more pronounced in first-time parents compared 
with experienced parents, in mothers compared with fathers, and in breastfeeding compared with bottle-feeding mothers. Higher 
socioeconomic status (household income) and psychosocial factors (dual vs. single parenting) do not appear to protect against these 
postpartum sleep changes.

Introduction
Poor sleep quality and insufficient sleep are highly prevalent 
during pregnancy and after childbirth [1–8]. Although sleep 
disturbances have been linked with adverse birth outcomes 
[9, 10] and poor postpartum mental health [3, 11–14], 
intraindividual changes in maternal and paternal sleep across 
prepregnancy, pregnancy, and the postpartum years remain 
poorly described.
Existing longitudinal studies have shown that from late 
pregnancy onwards, insomnia symptoms remain highly 
prevalent and sleep duration decreases [15, 16], with first-time 
mothers more strongly affected than those experiencing their 
second or third childbirth [3]. During late pregnancy, sleep 
onset insomnia symptoms are more prevalent compared with 
the postpartum period, whereas sleep maintenance insomnia 
symptoms are more prevalent postpartum than during 
pregnancy [16]. Although paternal sleep is also affected, there 
are indications that maternal sleep is more highly fragmented 
[17], includes longer periods spent awake after sleep onset 
[18], and leads to greater neurobehavioral performance 
deficits, such as decreased psychomotor vigilance [17]. Slight 
improvements in sleep quality are typically reported around 
weeks 10–12 postpartum [3, 19] and, consistent with this, the 
percentage of mothers with insomnia symptoms decreases 
from approximately 60% at week 8 postpartum to 40% at 2 years 
postpartum [16]. However, the exact course of sleep recovery as 
individuals’ parental roles mature is yet to be explored.
Furthermore, little is known regarding the impact of 
protective and risk factors on sleep disturbances during 
pregnancy and the postpartum years; most previous research 
has considered the effects of breastfeeding on maternal sleep, 
with inconsistent findings. Although one study showed greater 
sleep fragmentation among breastfeeding women [15], others 
have not found sleep duration or quality differences between 
women using different feeding methods [7], or even longer sleep 
duration among breastfeeding mothers [20] (for a review, see 
Montgomery-Downs and colleagues [21]).
The role of some commonplace sociodemographic and 
psychosocial variables has not been investigated in detail either. 
For example, the extent to which parental age and parity may 
play a role in amplifying or buffering the effect of pregnancy 
and childbirth on sleep. One would also expect that variables 
representing higher socioeconomic status (higher household 
income and homeownership) would protect against sleep 
disturbance, insofar as they are known to decrease stress 
levels generally [22]. It also makes sense to reason that living 
with a partner (i.e. dual parenting vs. single parenting) may 
be protective. Compared with single parenting, dual parenting 
involves higher levels of direct, practical support that might 
protect sleep (e.g. the partner may assist with nocturnal feedings) 
and/or emotional support, which may decrease perception of 
stress and thereby protect sleep [23, 24]. Clarity on the role of 
these variables would help interpret the effects of pregnancy 
and childbirth on sleep within a socioeconomic context.
Further limiting our current understanding of sleep during 
pregnancy and after childbirth is that most investigators have 
used convenience samples, whereas population-representative 
samples have rarely been assessed. Existing studies with 
representative samples have been based on cohorts of pregnant 
women from hospitals with a geographically limited catchment 
area [3, 16]; no previous study has been based on a sample 
representative of a whole nation’s population.
Identifying the precise timing and trends in, and factors 
underlying, sleep changes during and after pregnancy, would 
inform the development of evidence-based interventions 
for preventing or ameliorating the effects of pregnancy and 
childbirth on parental sleep. In the present study, we aimed to 
address gaps in the literature by taking advantage of a large, 
longitudinal panel study that represents the entire adult German 
population and by analyzing intraindividual change across 
time using fixed-effects regression models. First, we examined 
whether mothers’ and fathers’ sleep satisfaction and duration 
decrease across prepregnancy, pregnancy, and the postpartum 
periods, with the expectation that mothers’ sleep satisfaction 
and duration would decline during pregnancy and reach a nadir 
during early postpartum, whereas fathers’ sleep satisfaction 
and duration would not be affected during pregnancy and less 
strongly affected postpartum compared with mothers. Second, 
we determined whether and when mothers’ and fathers’ sleep 
satisfaction and duration improved following childbirth, with 
the expectation that sleep satisfaction and duration should have 
reached baseline levels, after controlling for age, by the time 
the child reached their preschool years (4–6 years postpartum). 
Finally, we examined the roles of potential protective and 
risk factors for mothers’ and fathers’ sleep satisfaction and 
duration during pregnancy and the postpartum years, including 
sociodemographic background variables (maternal and paternal 
age, parity, household income, and homeownership), infant 
feeding practices (breastfeeding), and psychosocial variables 
(dual vs. single parenting).
Methods
Database source
The data were drawn from the German Socio-Economic Panel 
(SOEP; Version 32.1; German Institute for Economic Research), 
an ongoing, nationally representative, longitudinal study of 
private households in Germany. All members of the selected 
households aged 18 years and older were asked to participate 
in yearly interviews. Households were initially chosen using a 
multistage random sampling technique with regional clustering; 
later, some refreshment samples were added to increase the 
sample size and maintain the representativeness of the data for 
the entire population of Germany. In addition, new household 
members (e.g. new partners or grown-up children) were invited 
to join the study and were also interviewed during the yearly 
assessment sessions. To minimize attrition, individuals were 
followed even in cases of relocation or a split in the household.
We used the measures of sleep satisfaction and duration 
collected during the annual interviews for eight waves of the 
SOEP (2008–2015). Comprehensive information about data 
collection, design, participants, variables, and assessment 
procedures has been described elsewhere [25]. All data were 
collected by a professional fieldwork organization (Kantar Public, 
Munich). The interview methodology of the SOEP is based on a 
set of pretested questionnaires for households and individuals. 
Generally, an interviewer tries to obtain face-to-face interviews 
with all members of a given survey household. All participants 
provided informed consent; ethical permission was granted by

SOEP is available to universities and research institutes. There 
have been no previous publications using SOEP data addressing 
the topics presented herein.
Participants
The sample included 2541 women and 2118 men who reported 
the birth of their first, second, or third child during the study 
period, lived in Germany, and contributed longitudinal data (i.e. 
at least two available data points on either sleep satisfaction or 
sleep duration); mothers were on average 32.9 (SD = 5.69) years 
and fathers were on average 36.18 (SD = 6.39) years old; with an 
average of 5.1 data points per participant for sleep satisfaction 
(SD = 2.0) and 4.6 for sleep duration (SD = 1.6). Average parental 
age at the birth of the first child was 30.10 years (SD = 5.37) 
for mothers and 33.26 years (SD = 5.82) for fathers. During the 
observation period (2008–2015), a total of 2128 participants 
reported the birth of their first child (54.37% mothers; 1338 
first-born children); 2461 participants reported the birth of their 
second child (54.57% mothers; 1495 second-born children); and 
1032 participants reported the birth of their third child (54.55% 
mothers; 671 third-born children). Few participants reported 
the birth of their fourth to twelfth child. These were excluded 
from analyses once they reached the “2 years before childbirth” 
position with their fourth child (N = 690 for sleep satisfaction; 
N = 656 for sleep duration; see Appendix Table 1 for coding 
of childbirth for statistical analyses). The total panel sample 
comprised N = 38 861 participants with longitudinal data on 
either sleep satisfaction or sleep duration. Descriptive statistics 
are reported in Table 1. Participant flow charts can be found in 
Supplementary Figures S1 and S2.
Measures
Childbirth biography
Childbirth biographies are provided by the SOEP for every 
participant with at least one successful interview. To generate 
childbirth biographies, all available SOEP data were used, 
including information from the biographical questionnaire 
completed when each participant entered the panel; new 
childbirth information was collected during annual interviews.

Sleep satisfaction and sleep duration were self-reported by 
participants during the annual interviews between 2008 and 
2015 (sleep duration was not included in 2014 due to interview 
time constraints). To reduce respondent burden as much as 
possible, only a single item indicator of sleep satisfaction was 
used (“How satisfied are you with your sleep?”), which was rated 
on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (“totally unsatisfied”) to 10 
(“totally satisfied”). This single item is strongly correlated with 
validated scales that measure sleep problems and discriminates 
between individuals affected vs. unaffected by sleep disturbance 
[26–28]. Sleep duration was assessed with two items: “How 
many hours do you sleep on average on a normal day during the 
working week?” and “How many hours do you sleep on a normal 
weekend day?” Implausibly low or high values were unusual 
(i.e. sleep duration <2 hr: 85 observations; sleep duration >12 
hr: 290 observations) and were replaced by a value of 2 or 12 hr, 
respectively. A weighted composite score was calculated as an 
indicator of mean sleep duration (i.e. sleep duration = ([5 × work 
day sleep duration] + [2 × weekend sleep duration])/7).
Breastfeeding
Associations between breastfeeding and parental sleep were 
assessed in a subsample of parents who had their first child 
within the observation period (2008–2015). Information on 
primiparous mothers’ breastfeeding was available for 1799 
parents regarding sleep satisfaction and for 1581 parents 
regarding sleep duration. Whether children were exclusively 
breastfed, and for how long, was not asked. Up to 3 months 
after the birth of their first child, 74.48% of mothers were still 
breastfeeding; 48.91% of mothers were still breastfeeding when 
their child was 4 to 6 months old.
Household income, homeownership, and single parenting
Participants’ average monthly household income after taxes was 
2829€ (SD = 1467€) at the birth of the first child. Home-ownership 
was reported by 29.33% when their first child was born. 
Compared with parents living in flats let for rent, homeowners 
had considerably larger living spaces (M = 132.02 m2, SD = 44.86 
m2 vs. M = 83.23 m2, SD = 24.58 m2, respectively; p < .001). Single 
parenting was defined as participants indicating that they lived 
without a romantic partner with their child or children. Single 
parenthood after birth of the first child was reported by 6.11% of 
all primiparous parents (n = 130; 117 women and 13 men).
Statistical analyses
To analyze changes in sleep satisfaction and duration over the 
course of pregnancy and postpartum, we used fixed-effects 
models [29] (for the same analytic approach using SOEP-data, 
see Mata and colleagues [30]). Fixed-effects models exclusively 
analyze within-individual variation, which avoids confounding 
of results by time-constant unobserved heterogeneity, such as 
social origin or genetic differences in sleep satisfaction and 
habitual sleep duration. Thus, the participants’ sleep satisfaction 
and duration after the birth of a child were compared with their 
own prechildbirth sleep satisfaction and duration. Furthermore, 
the models control for all other included predictors (e.g. effects 
of the second childbirth are controlled for effects of the first 
childbirth) and control variables including participant-centered 
age and age-squared, because sleep quality and duration decline 
with age [31, 32].
To calculate these fixed-effects models, the variable of time 
between interviews and childbirth was represented with 21 
dummy variables (coded 0 or 1) within every measurement wave. 
Within one measurement wave, dummy variables 1–7, 8–14, and 
15–21 represented the time between the interview and the births 
of the first, second, or third child, respectively. Thus, there were 
seven dummy variables per childbirth. The dummy codes for the 
first childbirth were: Year 2 before 1st childbirth = the participant’s 
first child was born during the second year after that interview; 
Year 1 before 1st childbirth = the first child was born during the 
year after that interview; Year 1 after 1st childbirth = the first child 
was born during the year before that interview; Year 2 after 1st 
childbirth = the first child was born between 1 and 2 years before 
that interview; Year 3 after 1st childbirth = the first child was born 
between 2 and 3 years before that interview; Years 4 to 6 after 1st 
childbirth = the first child was born between 3 and 6 years before 
that interview; More than 6 years after 1st childbirth = the first child 
was born more than 6 years before that interview. These seven 
predictors were mutually exclusive. The same coding procedure 
was used for the second and third childbirths (Appendix Table 1).
Several secondary (follow-up) analyses were conducted: 
(1) To analyze the changes in sleep satisfaction and duration 
across pregnancy and the first year after the birth of the first 
child at a more fine-grained level, separate follow-up analyses 
were conducted with indicators for each of the three pregnancy 
trimesters and indicators for each of the four quarters of the 
first year after childbirth. This allowed studying the more 
detailed course of sleep satisfaction and duration over the 
trimesters of pregnancy and postpartum; (2) further follow-up 
analyses were conducted using the birth of the first child to test 
potential protective or risk factors as time-varying covariates: 
breastfeeding, maternal and paternal age, household income, 
homeownership, and dual parenting (vs. single parenting). 
The analyses of the time-varying covariates related to risk and 
protective factors rely on comparisons between coefficients 
of fixed-effects regression models, which are derived from 
different subsets of participants.
All analyses were conducted using Stata Version 15 (College 
Station, TX). All Cohen’s d score effect sizes were calculated 
based on the standard deviation of the full sample.
Sensitivity analysis
As is the case in all linear fixed-effects models with longitudinal 
data, the effect on within-person change (i.e. regarding sleep 
satisfaction and duration) can only be calculated for participants 
who report variation in the outcome of interest over time [29]. In 
our case, variation in sleep satisfaction was reported by 89.98% of 
all participants (with 176 061 observations in total) and variation 
in sleep duration was reported by 86.21% of all participants 
(with 144 779 observations in total). In the entire sample, 3848 
participants did not report any change in sleep satisfaction and 
4864 participants did not report any change in sleep duration. For 
sensitivity analysis, all participants were assigned an artificial 
within-person change (i.e. a mean of 0.0 and a SD of 0.0001) so 
that all participants were included in the analyses. The results of 
this analysis (not shown) were identical to those of the sample 
reporting change in sleep satisfaction or sleep duration.

Furthermore, we compared participants with only one 
measurement time point and those with more measurements 
(i.e. participants with longitudinal data that could be used for 
fixed-effects analyses). There were only small differences in 
sleep satisfaction (7.04 vs. 6.80, respectively) and sleep duration 
(7.23 vs. 7.17 hr, respectively; all p’s < .001). These differences 
were further reduced after accounting for between-groups age 
differences (sleep satisfaction: d = 0.04, p < .001; sleep duration: 
d = 0.02, p = .11); participants with only one observation were 
younger and more likely to have been newly recruited (i.e. in the 
most recently added wave; p < .001). Thus, when age differences 
were accounted for, sleep satisfaction and duration were highly 
similar between participants who were included and those who 
were excluded from the fixed-effects models.
Results
Descriptive analyses
Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1, separately for 
women and men. On average, women reported slightly lower 
sleep satisfaction (M = 6.65 vs. M = 6.98, d = 0.15; p < .001) and 
almost identical sleep duration compared with men (M = 7 hr 
9 min vs. M = 7 hr 11 min, d = 0.03; p < .001). In both women and 
men, sleep satisfaction was worse, and sleep duration shorter, 
for participants reporting childbirth compared with those not 
reporting childbirth (women: M = 6.58 vs. M = 6.66, d = 0.04 
and M = 7 hr vs. M = 7 hr 10 min, d = 0.15, respectively; men: 
M = 6.97 vs. M = 7.03, d = 0.03 and M = 6 hr 59 min vs. M = 7 hr 
13 min, d = 0.21, respectively; all p’s < .01). Participant age was 
negatively correlated with sleep satisfaction, r = −.10, p < .001, 
and sleep duration, r = −.04, p < .001. Socioeconomic status 
and homeownership were associated with sleep satisfaction 
and duration, although the differences between groups were 
very small. Participants above the median monthly household 
income (Mdn = 2500€) showed slightly higher sleep satisfaction 
and slightly longer sleep duration compared with participants 
below the median (sleep satisfaction: M = 7.03 vs. M = 6.58, 
d = 0.20, p < .001; sleep duration: M = 7 hr 12 min vs. M = 7 hr 
8 min, d = 0.06; p < .001). Homeowners showed slightly higher 
sleep satisfaction and slightly longer sleep duration compared 
with nonhomeowners (sleep satisfaction: M = 6.94 vs. M = 6.65, 
d = 0.13, p < .001; sleep duration: M = 7 hr 13 min vs. M = 7 hr 
7 min, d = 0.08, p < .001).
Course of sleep satisfaction and duration across 
pregnancy and birth of the first, second, and third 
child, for mothers and fathers
Fixed-effects regression models showed that for mothers, 
sleep satisfaction decreased with pregnancy and postpartum 
compared with before pregnancy (all p’s < .001, see Table 2 and 
Figure 1). Compared with the penultimate interview before the 
respective childbirth, mothers’ sleep satisfaction decreased by 
an average of 1.53 points on the 0 to 10 scale (d = 0.67) after the 
birth of their first child, 0.96 points (d = 0.42) after the second, 
and 1.15 points (d = 0.51) after the third. Mothers’ sleep duration 
increased slightly during pregnancy (10 min, d = 0.14, p < .01) 
but decreased sharply after childbirth compared with before 
pregnancy; sleep duration decreased on average by 41 min 
(d = 0.59) after the first child, 39 min (d = 0.58) after the second, 
and 44 min (d = 0.64) after the third (all p’s < .001, see Table 2 
and Figure 1). Four to six years after the birth of their first child, 
maternal sleep satisfaction and duration were still lower than 
prepregnancy, after controlling for age (0.95 scale points, d = 0.42 
for sleep satisfaction and 22 min, d = 0.32 for sleep duration, all 
p’s < .001). The birth of the second and third children affected 
mothers’ sleep satisfaction significantly less than did the birth 
of the first child (all p’s < .001), whereas the effects on sleep 
duration were similar after the first, second, and third childbirth 
(all p’s > .05).
Consistent with mothers, fathers’ sleep satisfaction and 
duration decreased after childbirth compared with before 
pregnancy (p < .05, see Table 2 and Figure 1) although compared 
with mothers these effects were significantly smaller (all p’s < 
.001). An exception was fathers’ sleep satisfaction after the birth 
of their third child, when sleep satisfaction no longer showed 
a significant decrease. In terms of effect sizes and compared 
with before pregnancy (i.e. at the second to last interview 
before the respective childbirth), fathers’ sleep satisfaction 
decreased by d = 0.18 (0.41 scale points), d = 0.09 (0.20 points), 
and d = 0.08 (0.19 points) after the birth of their first, second, 
and third children. Moreover, fathers’ sleep duration decreased 
on average by 14 min (d = 0.21), 9 min (d = 0.13), and 12 min 
(d = 0.18) after the first, second, and third child. Four to six years 
after the birth of their first child, fathers’ sleep satisfaction and 
duration were still lower than their prepregnancy values (0.64 
scale points, d = 0.28 for sleep satisfaction and 14 min, d = 0.21 
for sleep duration, all p’s < .01) after controlling for age. The 
birth of their second child affected fathers’ sleep satisfaction 
less than did the birth of their first child (all p’s < .05), whereas 
the effect on sleep duration was very similar after the first, 
second, and third childbirth.
Fine-grained analysis of sleep satisfaction and 
duration across the three pregnancy trimesters and 
first year after childbirth
Next, we conducted finer-grained analyses focusing on the 
first childbirth, with indicators for the last quarter year before 
pregnancy, each of the three pregnancy trimesters, and each of 
the four quarters of the first year after the child’s birth (Figure 
2; Supplementary Tables S1–S4). There was a decrease in sleep 
satisfaction across the three pregnancy trimesters in women 
but not in men. There was no decrease in sleep duration across 
pregnancy in either women or men. However, there was a clear 
decrease in sleep satisfaction and duration between the third 
pregnancy trimester and the first 3 months after childbirth in 
both women and men (all p’s < .001). In terms of the magnitude of 
change, compared with prepregnancy, sleep satisfaction was 1.81 
scale points (d = 0.79) lower in women and 0.37 points (d = 0.16) 
lower in men; sleep duration was 62 min (d = 0.90) shorter in 
women and 13 min (d = 0.19) shorter in men. Compared with the 
third trimester of pregnancy, sleep satisfaction after childbirth 
was 0.57 points (d = 0.25) lower in women and 0.96 points 
(d = 0.42) lower in men; sleep duration was 87 min (d = 1.27) 
shorter in women and 27 min (d = 0.40) shorter in men. Between 
the first 3 month quarter and the second 3 month quarter after 
childbirth, both mothers’ and fathers’ sleep duration improved 
(all p’s < .001).

Potential protective and risk factors for mothers’ 
and fathers’ sleep satisfaction and duration across 
pregnancy and after the birth of their first child
Among the variables analyzed as potential protective or 
risk factors for parental sleep, maternal and paternal age, 
household income, and dual parenthood vs. single parenthood 
(for mothers) were unrelated to changes in either sleep 
satisfaction or duration across pregnancy and in the first 
year after birth of the first child (Supplementary Tables S5–
S8). However, breastfeeding slightly increased the negative 
effect of childbirth on sleep satisfaction and duration among 
mothers (0.72 points, d = 0.32 for sleep satisfaction; 14 min, 
d = 0.21 for sleep duration, all p’s < .01) but not among fathers. 
Homeownership was associated with slightly better sleep 
satisfaction (0.27 points, d = 0.12, p < .05) and slightly longer 
sleep duration (8 min, d = 0.12, p < .05) in mothers.
Discussion
Our study shows, for the first time with a large population-
representative panel study and a long-term follow-up of more 
than 6 years, that maternal sleep satisfaction decreases linearly 
across the three trimesters of pregnancy and reaches a nadir 
during the first 3 months after birth; thereafter, maternal sleep 
satisfaction improves, though it does not reach prepregnancy 
levels even up to 6 years postpartum. Maternal sleep duration 
increases slightly during pregnancy, but in the first 3 months 
postpartum women experience, on average, a marked 1 hr 
reduction per night compared with prepregnancy. Although 
sleep duration then increases by around 30 min, on average, 
during months 4–6 postpartum, it does not recover fully to 
prepregnancy levels even up to 6 years after the birth.
After the second and third child, the effects on maternal 
sleep satisfaction are less pronounced than after the first child. 
In contrast, maternal sleep duration shows a similar magnitude 
of change regardless of whether it was after the first, second, or 
third child. In sum, childbirth causes pervasive sleep effects for 
women, despite being a common life-event. Most intriguingly, 
our study is the first to show that mothers’ sleep satisfaction 
and duration do not recover to prepregnancy levels even up 
to 6 years after birth of the first child, having adjusted for 
maternal age.
Changes in paternal sleep satisfaction and duration after 
birth compared with prepregnancy are less pronounced and 
reach only around a third or less of the effect sizes seen in 
mothers. This may be associated with the observation that 
mothers, including working women, still have more household 
and child rearing responsibilities and spend more time on 
these tasks compared with fathers in most industrialized

countries including Germany [33, 34]. It is possible that an 
unequal distribution of the burden of child nursing at night 
favoring fathers is reflected in a less pronounced decline in 
sleep satisfaction and sleep duration in fathers than mothers 
after childbirth. However, neither father’s sleep satisfaction nor 
sleep duration reaches prepregnancy levels up to 6 years after 
the birth of their first child. Taken together, the long-term course 
of both mothers’ and fathers’ sleep satisfaction and duration 
even up to 6 years following the birth of their first child indicates 
incomplete recovery.
In line with previous research, our findings show a 
decrease in parental sleep satisfaction during later pregnancy 
and immediately after childbirth [1–3, 6–8, 15, 16, 27], an 
improvement after the first three postpartum months have 
passed in mothers [3, 19], more pronounced effects in mothers 
compared with fathers [17, 18], and more pronounced effects 
after the first compared with the second and third child [3]. 
The nadir of mothers’ sleep satisfaction and duration during 
the first 3 months after childbirth coincides with the peak in 
infant crying [35]. It is possible that children’s increased fussing 
and crying during the first 3 months after birth, along with 
their dependence on frequent nocturnal feedings and other 
caretaking, are important reasons for parental sleep disturbance 
after childbirth. Apart from infant crying and frequent nursing, 
other potential proximate causes of poor postpartum sleep may 
involve physical pain following delivery and distress related to 
the demands of a new role. Causes of the long-term decrease 
in sleep satisfaction and duration till 6 years after birth may 
involve changes in duties, strains, and worries related to the 
parental role even when children are older.
One aim of our study was to examine the roles of several 
potential factors that may be protective of maternal and paternal 
sleep during pregnancy and postpartum. Our study shows that 
breastfeeding is related to a slight decrease in maternal sleep 
satisfaction (0.72 points on the 0 to 10 scale, d = 0.33) and 
duration (14 min, d = 0.21). This finding adds further evidence 
to the long-standing question about whether breastfeeding 
is related to sleep quality, for which previous research has 
yielded inconsistent findings. Our results are consistent 
with a study showing more sleep fragmentation among 
breastfeeding women [15] but they are also in contrast to studies 
showing no differences in sleep between breastfeeding and 
nonbreastfeeding women [36] or even longer sleep duration in 
breastfeeding mothers [20]. It is possible that these inconsistent 
findings are due to differences in sample selection. Although 
other studies have examined sleep in convenience samples, 
the current study included a large sample representative of the 
adult population in Germany. Furthermore, it is possible that 
inconsistent findings are due to differences in measurement of 
sleep (e.g. self-report vs. actigraphy).
Towards determining other factors that may protect 
maternal and paternal sleep satisfaction and duration, we 
studied sociodemographic (parental age), socioeconomic 
(household income and homeownership), and psychosocial 
(dual vs. single parenting) factors. Among these, only 
homeownership emerged as a significant factor for mothers’ 
sleep; however, the effect size was very modest. Our 
examination of potential protective factors therefore suggests 
that wealthier parents, parents who are older, and mothers 
who live with a partner are equally vulnerable to the sleep-
impairing effects of pregnancy and childbirth as are less 
wealthy, younger, and single counterparts.
Although our study has important strengths, including 
our examination of a large representative sample and 
analysis of sleep patterns longitudinally from prepregnancy 
through pregnancy and until 6 years after childbirth, it also 
includes some limitations. First, only single-item survey 
questions were administered. Although there is evidence 
for reliability and validity of single-item questions about 
sleep satisfaction and duration [27, 37, 38]—and objective 
sleep recordings with samples of this size are impractical—
employing objective measures of sleep may nonetheless have 
strengthened our study. Moreover, it is possible that more 
sensitive measures of psychosocial support during pregnancy 
and the postpartum years may have revealed more protective

duration in hours (B) for women and men before pregnancy (tri0: trimester 0 
including months 1–3 before pregnancy), during pregnancy (tri1: months 1–3 of

during the first year of the firstborns life (quart1: months 1–3 after childbirth; 
quart2: months 4–6 after childbirth; quart3: months 7–9 after childbirth; quart4: 
months 10–12 after childbirth). The approximate time of birth is indicated by 
a vertical line. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals of fixed-effects 
regression coefficients. Note that neighboring confidence intervals are generated 
by different subsets of participants.

effects on sleep. Relatedly, we could not distinguish between 
exclusive breastfeeding and breastfeeding supplemented 
by formula or infants receiving breast milk from the bottle. 
Second, it is possible that other variables which were not 
analyzed herein may have moderated the effect of childbirth 
on sleep, such as bed-sharing (co-sleeping with the infant), 
duration of family leave, or body mass index. Third, due 
to the study design, only yearly assessment waves are 
available. This precludes analysis of changes in sleep across 
the trimesters of pregnancy and the postpartum quarters 
in a pure longitudinal analysis. Fourth, although our study 
shows within-individual changes across time that coincide 
with pregnancy and childbirth, this does not preclude the 
possibility that other, unobserved causal mechanisms may 
have been involved. Finally, it is impossible to exclude the 
possibility that panel dropout was nonrandom, which may 
have affected effect sizes and interpretation of the findings. 
Although sensitivity analyses indicated that there were no 
sleep differences between participants who continued or 
dropped out, it is possible that changes in sleep may have 
occurred after the last interview.
In conclusion, our study shows that pregnancy, and 
particularly 
the 
first 
several 
months 
postpartum, 
is 
accompanied by a marked decline in parental sleep 
satisfaction. This is especially true for first-time mothers, for 
whom childbirth is presumably the most significantly sleep-
altering life event during their adulthood. After the birth of a 
first child, sleep satisfaction apparently does not fully recover 
to prepregnancy levels in either mothers or fathers. It is 
therefore possible that parenthood contributes meaningfully 
to the well-documented overall decline in sleep satisfaction 
during adulthood [31, 32]. We found little evidence for factors 
that might offset the impacts of pregnancy and childbirth 
on parental sleep. Higher socioeconomic status and dual 
parenting do not buffer against the decrease in either sleep 
satisfaction or duration, whereas breastfeeding and living 
in a rented flat appear to only slightly amplify the effect 
on maternal sleep during the first 3 months postpartum. 
Because sleep plays an important role for adjustment and 
mental health during pregnancy and postpartum, it is an 
important task for future research to examine ways to protect 
sleep satisfaction and duration in this stage of the life cycle. 
Furthermore, advice and support should be routinely provided 
for new parents preparing for childbirth, towards managing 
their postpartum sleep expectations and to encourage them 
to take precautions to reduce risks from the effects of sleep 
fragmentation and deprivation.
Appendix
Indicators for the first, second, and third childbirth were coded 
using the participants’ childbirth biography, which is provided 
by the SOEP for every participant who has had at least one 
successful interview. To generate the childbirth biography, 
all available SOEP data were used, including information 
from the biographical questionnaire completed when each 
participant entered the panel; new childbirth information 
was collected during the annual interviews. The time between 
interviews and childbirth(s) was represented using 21 dummy 
variables (coded 0 or 1) per measurement wave. Within one 
measurement wave, dummy variables 1–7, 8–14, and 15–21 
represent the time between the interview and the births of 
the first, second, and third child, respectively. Thus, there 
were seven dummy variables per childbirth; the dummy codes 
for the first childbirth were: Year 2 before 1st childbirth = the 
participant’s first child was born during the second year after 
that interview; Year 1 before 1st childbirth = the first child 
was born during the year after that interview; Year 1 after 1st 
childbirth = the first child was born during the year before 
that interview; Year 2 after 1st childbirth = the first child was 
born between 1 and 2 years before that interview; Year 3 after 
1st childbirth = the first child was born between 2 and 3 years 
before that interview; Years 4 to 6 after 1st childbirth = the 
first child was born between 3 and 6 years before that 
interview; More than 6 years after 1st childbirth = the first 
child was born more than 6 years before that interview. These 
seven predictors were mutually exclusive. The same coding 
procedure was used for the second and the third childbirths. 
Please note that the respective seven indicators for the first, 
second, and third childbirths are not mutually exclusive; that 
is, the effects of previous children were taken into account 
when the effects of subsequent children were estimated 
(Appendix Table 1).
