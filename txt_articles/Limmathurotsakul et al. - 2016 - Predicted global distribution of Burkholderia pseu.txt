Abstract
Burkholderia pseudomallei, a highly pathogenic bacterium that causes melioidosis, is commonly 
found in soil in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia1,2. Melioidosis can be difficult to diagnose 
due to its diverse clinical manifestations and the inadequacy of conventional bacterial 
identification methods3. The bacterium is intrinsically resistant to a wide range of antimicrobials, 
and treatment with ineffective antimicrobials may result in case fatality rates (CFRs) exceeding 
70%4,5. The importation of infected animals has, in the past, spread melioidosis to non-endemic 
areas6,7. The global distribution of B. pseudomallei and burden of melioidosis, however, remain 
poorly understood. Here, we map documented human and animal cases, and the presence of 
environmental B. pseudomallei, and combine this in a formal modelling framework8-10 to estimate 
the global burden of melioidosis. We estimate there to be 165,000 (95% credible interval 
68,000-412,000) human melioidosis cases per year worldwide, of which 89,000 (36,000-227,000) 
die. Our estimates suggest that melioidosis is severely underreported in the 45 countries in which 
it is known to be endemic and that melioidosis is likely endemic in a further 34 countries which 
have never reported the disease. The large numbers of estimated cases and fatalities emphasise that 
the disease warrants renewed attention from public health officials and policy makers.

 Melioidosis is a disease of public health importance in areas of Southeast Asia and 
Australia, and is considered a potential emerging infectious disease in many tropical 
developing countries11. In northeast Thailand, there are around 2,000 culture-confirmed 
melioidosis cases per year with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 40%12. In Singapore, 550 
melioidosis cases occurred during the last ten years, of which a fifth resulted in death13. Skin 
inoculation is considered the main route of infection in agricultural workers in developing 
countries14. Recent evidence also suggests that inhalation of B. pseudomallei during extreme 
weather events15,16 and ingestion of B. pseudomallei contaminated water are also important 
routes of infection17. High-risk groups include patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic 
kidney disease and excessive alcohol intake12,18. Developed countries are also observing an 
emergence of melioidosis related to travelling and importation of cases11. No licensed 
vaccine for melioidosis is currently available. Strengthening of microbiological laboratories 
and research facilities often results in the discovery of B. pseudomallei in new areas; recent 
national additions include India, Southern China, Brazil and Malawi11,19. Given the 
diagnostic limitations3, it is likely that B. pseudomallei is present in many other tropical 
countries but has not yet been detected.
Importation of infected humans and animals could lead to the establishment of B. 
pseudomallei in previously unaffected areas because the organism can be released to and 
persist in the environment. Previous importation events to non-endemic regions include an 
outbreak of melioidosis in 1975 in Paris, resulting in the deaths of two humans and an 
unknown number of animals6,7. B. pseudomallei then persisted in the soil for up to six 
years6. A recent outbreak of melioidosis in a non-endemic area occurred at Tulane Primate 
Research Center, Louisiana, USA, in November 201420. The results of a CDC investigation 
concluded that the organism had spread from a building where mice were being infected 
experimentally to primates within the facility possibly through contamination of the inner 
garments worn by staff20. It is, however, not yet known whether B. pseudomallei could have 
contaminated and persisted in the environment in Louisiana.
Knowledge about the global burden of melioidosis and its potential to become established in 
non-endemic areas is poor. Previous maps of melioidosis simply displayed countries that had 
reported melioidosis cases11 and therefore provided no information on areas where 
melioidosis could be endemic but undiagnosed. In addition, previous maps could not 
estimate the global morbidity and mortality of melioidosis11, which are essential for policy 
makers to help determine allocation of the limited resources available for public health. 
Finally, previous maps could not determine the level of risk of B. pseudomallei 
establishment in the event that the organism was released in non-endemic areas.
Here we present the first evidence-based predicted map of B. pseudomallei, and estimate the 
total incidence and mortality due to melioidosis worldwide for 2015 (see Supplementary 
Information Figure 1-3). A globally comprehensive database has been compiled, comprising 
22,338 geo-located records of human and animal melioidosis, as well as the presence of 
environmental B. pseudomallei from reports published from 1910 to 2014 (Supplementary 
Figure 4). We assessed the strength of evidence for melioidosis endemicity at a national 
level, ranging from complete consensus on absence to complete consensus on presence (see 
Limmathurotsakul et al.

 Supplementary methods and Figure 1). A boosted regression tree (BRT) statistical model 
was used to estimate environmental suitability for B. pseudomallei globally at a resolution of 
5 km × 5 km using a database of occurrence records and a set of gridded environmental 
covariates known, or hypothesised, to affect the presence of B. pseudomallei. We then used a 
multivariable negative binomial regression model to relate the environmental suitability 
values generated by the BRT model to geo-positioned incidence data to estimate the 
incidence of melioidosis cases in each 5 km × 5 km square. We similarly applied a logistic 
regression model to estimate the mortality in these cases. Using bootstrap resampling and 
Monte Carlo simulations we developed an ensemble model of 2,500 global realisations of 
these incidence and case fatality maps to derive spatial estimates of the numbers of cases and 
deaths caused by the disease in melioidosis-endemic areas, along with corresponding 95% 
credible intervals (CrI). We excluded countries in which there is complete consensus on B. 
pseudomallei absence from the estimation of global incidence and mortality of melioidosis, 
and lastly we evaluated environmental suitability for B. pseudomallei in those areas to 
identify where imported cases may lead to subsequent B. pseudomallei establishment.
We predict that B. pseudomallei is ubiquitous throughout the tropics (Figure 2). The highest 
risk zones are in Southeast and South Asia, tropical Australia, Western sub-Saharan Africa 
and South America. Risk zones of varying sizes are also observed in Central America, 
Southern Africa and the Middle East. We found that high rainfall and temperature, and 
anthrosol and acrisol soil types were strongly associated with the presence of B. 
pseudomallei. Anthrosol is a soil type that has been modified profoundly by human activities 
particularly by irrigated agriculture, and acrisol is clay-rich soil found in tropical climates21. 
We also found that high salinity and high proportion of gravel were associated with the 
presence of B. pseudomallei (see Supplementary Information Figure 5). The association 
between presence of B. pseudomallei and high soil salinity is consistent with previous 
laboratory studies22. Although our model did not find an association between the presence 
of B. pseudomallei and soil pH reported by previous environmental studies23, this could be 
because soil pH is generally associated with other soil factors, particularly soil salinity21, 
reducing the capacity of our model to identify this as a geographic risk factor. Validation 
statistics indicated a high predictive performance of the BRT ensemble model with an area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 (95% CrI 0.76-0.86).
We estimate that there will be 165,000 melioidosis cases in 2015 among the three billion 
people living in the areas likely to contain B. pseudomallei (incidence rate of 5.0 per 
100,000 people at risk per year) (Table 1). The reported incidence rate of melioidosis was 
positively associated with environmental suitability for B. pseudomallei predicted by BRT, 
adjusted by country income level24, and prevalence of diabetes mellitus25 and indigenous 
ethnicity in Australia (see Supplementary Information Figure 6 and 7). Country income level 
was included to take account of a trend showing lower incidence rates in high-income 
countries (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 0.58, 95% CrI 0.23-1.39), which could be due 
to comparatively lower exposure rates, better prevention in general or other residual 
factors14-17. The prevalence of indigenous ethnicity was significantly associated with a 
higher incidence rate of melioidosis (aIRR 1.23, 95% CrI 1.09-1.38, for an increase of 10% 
prevalence of indigenous ethnicity). Indigenous ethnicity is likely to be a proxy of other risk 
factors such as excessive alcohol intake and chronic kidney disease, and higher exposure

 rates18. The development of high-resolution geographic data for these risk factors and 
additional epidemiological studies outside Southeast Asia and Australia would likely 
improve the model further.
We predict that only 40% of all melioidosis cases occur in the East Asia and Pacific region, 
where melioidosis is considered highly endemic. By contrast, South Asia is predicted to bear 
44% of the overall burden, because large populations live in areas contaminated with B. 
pseudomallei. Only Australia, Brunei Darussalam and Singapore have national surveillance 
data for melioidosis that are comparable to our estimates. Our estimates for other countries 
where melioidosis is known to be endemic were higher than reported (see Supplementary 
Information Table 1), supporting the suggestion that the burden of melioidosis in many 
tropical developing countries is hidden and masked by under-development of 
microbiological facilities, lack of relevant clinical and laboratory expertise3, and poor 
reporting systems.
We estimate that 89,000 people globally will die from melioidosis in 2015. We found that 
the mortality of melioidosis was strongly associated with the under-5 mortality rate (odds 
ratio (OR), 1.88, 95%CrI 1.73-2.07, for an increase of 10 times in infant deaths per 1,000 
live births)24 and used this to estimate the CFR for all predicted melioidosis cases. We 
predict that >99% of all deaths due to melioidosis occur in low- and middle-income 
countries, and <1% occur in high-income countries including Australia, Brunei Darussalam 
and Singapore (see Supplementary Information Figure 8).
We developed a list of priority countries where microbiological diagnostic facilities and 
disease reporting systems should be strengthened urgently, so that accurate diagnosis3 can be 
provided and the burden of melioidosis can then be defined. Appropriate prevention 
campaigns14 and treatment guidelines5 could then be implemented to reduce disease 
mortality rates. The list of priority countries includes 45 countries where melioidosis is 
known to be endemic but is underreported and a further 34 countries where melioidosis is 
probably endemic but has never been reported (Figure 3).
We also predict that two (USA and Japan) of the 44 countries where B. pseudomallei is 
considered currently absent have areas which would be suitable for B. pseudomallei 
establishment. These include a geographically contiguous area covering southern parts of 
Florida, Louisiana and Texas in the USA, and Okinawa and Kagoshima prefectures in Japan. 
These areas share similar environmental values to the Caribbean islands and Taiwan where 
melioidosis is known to be endemic (Figure 1). Following the recent outbreak at Tulane 
Primate Research Center, we evaluated the B. pseudomallei suitability level in Louisiana in 
more detail. The B. pseudomallei suitability level is very low at the Center (suitability level 
0.02) and is moderately high in New Orleans, 35 miles south of the Center (suitability level 
0.55). The suitability level 0.55 is comparable to other known endemic areas such as 
Saravane in Laos26 (suitability level 0.54), suggesting that it would be possible for B. 
pseudomallei to become established in Louisiana if the bacterium were to be released 
widely. It is also possible that B. pseudomallei is already present in the environment in USA 
and Japan but has never been detected.

 We have strived to be exhaustive in the assembly of contemporary data on melioidosis and 
have applied new modelling approaches to maximise the predictive power of these analyses. 
Our estimate of global mortality due to melioidosis (89,000 per year) is comparable to those 
due to measles (95,600 per year)27 and higher than that due to leptospirosis (50,000 per 
year)28 and dengue infection (9,100 – 12,500 per year)27,29 – diseases which are considered 
to be of high priority by many international health organizations27. The global burden of 
melioidosis is likely to be substantial and increasing due to population and pathogen 
movements increasing the likelihood of establishment in new areas, fuelled by an increase in 
anthrosol30 and the marked rise in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus globally27. This wide 
and potentially increasing geographical distribution and burden, combined with the high 
CFR particularly when melioidosis patients are undiagnosed and treated with ineffective 
antimicrobials4,5, highlight the need for public health officials and policymakers to raise the 
priority of this disease.
Methods
The occurrence database
The occurrence data set was comprised of geo-located records of human cases, animal cases 
and presence of B. pseudomallei in the environment derived from (i) peer reviewed literature 
and (ii) case reports (see Supplementary Information Figure 1, Panel a). For peer reviewed 
literature, we searched PubMed, GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank), 
MLST database (http://bpseudomallei.mlst.net) and Eurosurveillance database (http://
eurosurveillance.org) for studies describing human cases, animal cases or presence of B. 
pseudomallei in the environment between Jan 1, 1920 and Dec 31, 2014 using the MeSH 
terms “melioidosis” or “pseudomallei”. No language restrictions were placed on these 
searches, but only those citations with a full title and abstract were retrieved. We searched 
bibliographies from selected studies for secondary references. For case reports, we searched 
ProMED (http://www.promedmail.org), and Ministry of Health websites for each country. 
We also searched Google News archives (http://news.google.co.uk/archivesearch) using the 
same search terms and country name for news and reports of melioidosis at a country level.
An occurrence was defined as the reporting of a case of melioidosis infection or an 
identification of B. pseudomallei at an environmental sampling point. After processing, a 
total of 22,338 geo-located occurrences spanning a period from 1910 to 2014 were included. 
A summary of the data management procedure, beginning with the raw inputs and showing 
the proportion of data lost through the stages of quality control before reaching the final 
occurrence database is provided in Supplementary Information Figure 2. The final 
occurrence database with geo-positioned data points and the data dictionary are publicly 
available online (http://figshare.com/s/7f671b7610b811e59a3f06ec4b8d1f61).
Evidence for the presence of melioidosis was obtained from three types of source: health 
reporting organizations, peer-reviewed articles and case reports (see Supplementary 
Information Figure 1, Panel b). We then used a weighted scoring system to quantify 
evidence consensus (see Supplementary methods and Supplementary Information Figure 3).

 Explanatory covariates
We assembled gridded (5 km × 5 km pixel) global data for a suite of explanatory covariates 
of soil characteristics, climatic conditions and other covariates. These were chosen based on 
factors known or hypothesised to contribute to presence of B. pseudomallei in the soil. 
Covariates included (i) soil characteristics from Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) 
(http://www.iiasa.ac.at)21, (ii) precipitation and land surface temperature variables from the 
WorldClim database (www.worldclim.org), and (iii) a vegetation/moisture index from the 
Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) database of the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration (www.noaa.gov). HWSD and WorldClim are freely 
available sets of global soil and climate data at a 1 km ×1 km spatial resolution, respectively. 
All grids were resampled to the same 5 km × 5 km grid to ensure uniformity of land/water 
boundaries and spatial resolution.
Predicting environmental suitability for B. pseudomallei
We used a boosted regression tree (BRT) approach31 to establish a multivariable empirical 
relationship between the distribution of occurrence records of B. pseudomallei and the 
environmental conditions at each location, as has been previously applied to mapping 
dengue8, avian influenza9 and Ebola10 (see Supplementary Information Figure 1, Panel c). 
Model accuracy was assessed by calculating the mean cross-validated area under the curve 
(AUC) statistic32.
Estimation of populations at risk
People living in each 5 km × 5 km pixel with a predicted environmental suitability for B. 
pseudomallei greater than the value of the fifth percentile of the positive occurrence records 
were considered at risk of acquiring melioidosis in each submodel. The population density 
map was derived from Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP) 2010 (http://
sedac.ciesin.org/data/collection/grump-v1) and levelled to match national and global 
population projections for 2015 from UN World Population Prospects (http://esa.un.org/
wpp/). World regions were categorized according to the World Bank24.
Estimation of incidence of melioidosis
Published literature reporting annual incidence rates of melioidosis from the literature search 
described above were used to make spatial prediction of incidence rates (see Supplementary 
Information Figure 1, Panel d). Inclusion criteria were restricted to the literature reporting 
annual incidence rate (per 100,000 population) of culture-confirmed melioidosis or 
equivalent in a defined area. We then used a negative binomial model to estimate the 
incidence of melioidosis cases based on the B. pseudomallei suitability and the prevalence of 
diabetes and aboriginal population. The fitted negative binomial model was then applied to 
the 2015 human population surface, the B. pseudomallei suitability, the prevalence of 
diabetes25 and the prevalence of indigenous Australians to provide a mapped estimate of 
incidence.

 Estimation of mortality of melioidosis
Published literature reporting case fatality rates (CFRs) of melioidosis from the literature 
search described above were used to make spatial prediction of CFRs. Inclusion criteria 
were restricted to the literature reporting CFRs (%) of culture-confirmed melioidosis in a 
defined area. We evaluated the association of reported CFRs with national-level healthcare 
expenditure (HE) per capita, log10 transformed HE per capita, the national-level under-5 
mortality rate (U5MR)24 and log10 transformed U5MR by constructing multivariable 
logistic regression models and assessing their goodness of fit to the data. Reported HE and 
U5MR were expected to be a proxy for the capacity of medical services in the countries and 
associated with the CFRs of melioidosis. The optimal logistic regression model contained 
only log10 transformed U5MR. This model was then used to predict the number of deaths 
due to melioidosis by applying it to national-level log10 transformed U5MR and multiplying 
this by the gridded predictions of melioidosis incidence.
Development of priority country list
Priority countries included countries where melioidosis is known to be endemic but 
underreported, and countries where melioidosis is probably endemic but is never reported. 
Countries where melioidosis is known to be endemic were defined as countries with a 
national level of evidence from “complete presence” to “poor presence” and having the 
lower limit of 95% credible interval of predicted incidence of human melioidosis as more 
than or equal to one case per year. Countries where melioidosis is probably endemic were 
defined as countries with a national level of evidence from “indeterminate” to “good 
absence” and having the lower limit of 95% credible interval of predicted incidence of 
human melioidosis as more than or equal to one case per year. Countries with a level of 
evidence equal to “complete absence” were considered not endemic for melioidosis, and the 
level of risk of B. pseudomallei establishment was evaluated in the countries within this 
category.

 Figure 1. Global evidence consensus and geographic locations of occurrence data from 1910 to 
2014
Country coloring is based on evidence-based consensus with green representing a complete 
consensus on absence of B. pseudomallei and red a complete consensus on presence of B. 
pseudomallei. Black dots represent geo-located records of melioidosis cases or presence of 
B. pseudomallei.
