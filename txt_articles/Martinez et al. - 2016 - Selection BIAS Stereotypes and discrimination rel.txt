Although great strides have been made in increasing equality and inclusion in organizations, a number
of stigmatized groups are overlooked by diversity initiatives, including people with a history of cancer.
To examine the workplace experiences of these individuals in selection contexts, we conducted 3
complementary studies that assess the extent to which cancer is disclosed, the stereotypes associated with
cancer in the workplace, and discrimination resulting from these stereotypes. In a pilot study, we
surveyed 196 individuals with a history of cancer (across 2 samples) about their workplace disclosure
habits. In Study 1, we explored stereotypes related to employees with a history of cancer using the
framework outlined by the stereotype content model. In Study 2, we used a field study to assess the
experiences of job applicants who indicated they were “cancer survivors” (vs. not) with both formal and
interpersonal forms of discrimination. This research shows that cancer is disclosed at relatively high rates
(pilot study), those with a history of cancer are stereotyped as being higher in warmth than competence
(Study 1), and the stereotypes associated with those who have had cancer result in actual discrimination
toward them (Study 2). We discuss the theory behind these findings and aim to inform both science and
practice with respect to this growing workplace population.

Organizations have made great strides in increasing equality and
inclusion initiatives, but at least one hurdle that remains is the
exclusion of people with potentially stigmatizing health conditions
(Ball, Monaco, Schmeling, Schartz, & Blanck, 2005). The focus of
the current research is on reactions to one such health condition,
namely, having a history of cancer. Recent estimates indicate that
14 million individuals with a history of cancer are alive in the
United States today, a figure that is projected to grow to 19 million
over the next 10 years (de Santis et al., 2014). Importantly,
approximately 40% of individuals with a history of cancer are of
working age (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 2011).
Thus, these individuals make up a sizable portion of prospective
employees, coworkers, subordinates, and managers, highlighting
the importance of understanding the manifestation of discrimina-
tion in selection contexts for individuals with a history of cancer.
Indeed, individuals with a history of cancer are at a greater risk of
unemployment than their healthy counterparts (de Boer, Taskila,
Ojajärvi, van Dijk, & Verbeek, 2009; de Boer, Verbeek, & van
Dijk, 2006).
The present research examines how stereotypes associated with
a history of cancer influence return-to-work experiences. This
research extends the current literature in several ways. First, the
extant workplace cancer research does not examine the theoretical
reasons that might explain why individuals with a history of cancer
may receive differential treatment in the workplace. To address
this gap in the literature, we draw upon the stereotype content
model (SCM), which points to stereotypes of competence and
warmth (Cuddy, Fiske, & Glick, 2007; Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu,
2002). Within this framework, we argue that individuals with a
history of cancer will elicit ambivalent stereotypes—higher in
warmth than competence—which will manifest in specific behav-
ioral reactions from potential employers. Second, we focus on the
workplace context to examine how the tenets of the SCM influence
employees who have a history of cancer. We argue that although
perceptions of warmth may be attributed to people with a history
of cancer, competence is more important than warmth in work-

 place contexts. Moreover, within the SCM framework, we antic-
ipate that perceptions of relatively higher warmth than competence
will lead to specific behaviors, including passive harm. Third, the
existing SCM research relies upon correlational studies or exper-
iments in which hypothetical scenarios or target groups are uti-
lized. The present research extends this work by utilizing an
experimental field research design in which individuals apply for
actual jobs and interact with actual hiring personnel. As a whole,
the present research addresses a growing problem of potential
workplace discrimination as a result of a history of cancer and
advances knowledge about the SCM in organizational settings.
The SCM and Individuals With a History of Cancer
The SCM (Fiske et al., 2002; Fiske, Xu, Cuddy, & Glick, 1999)
articulates two important orthogonal dimensions of stereotypes—
perceptions of warmth and competence—which account for the
majority of variance in global impressions of others (Wojciszke,
Abele, & Baryla, 2009). In general, groups with goals that are
incompatible with one another represent threats to resources and
thus are stereotyped as being relatively low in warmth (Caprari-
ello, Cuddy, & Fiske, 2009). The warmth dimension captures
perceptions of a target’s benevolent intentions and tends to be
measured by traits such as morality, trustworthiness, sincerity,
kindness, and friendliness. The competence dimension captures
perceptions of a target’s ability to carry out benevolent (or lack
thereof) intentions and is measured by traits such as efficacy, skill,
creativity, confidence, and intelligence. Groups that are stereo-
typed as being relatively high in status are assumed to be more
competent than those that are relatively low in status, because of
the link between status and power to control resources (Caprariello
et al., 2009) and the (often erroneous) assumption that status is
because of ability (Fiske et al., 2002). These propositions have
been tested and replicated across many samples, using survey and
experimental methodologies, focused on both authentic and ma-
nipulated outgroups, and in many diverse cultures (for a review,
see Cuddy, Fiske, & Glick, 2008). It is important to highlight that
although previous studies use verbiage such as “high in warmth
and low in competence,” the way that these constructs are opera-
tionalized and measured suggests that it is the relative perceptions
of warmth and competence—rather than actual mean scores—that
determine outcomes.
Little research has focused on stereotypes associated with hav-
ing a history of cancer. Cho, Smith, et al.’s (2013) work reveals
that people believe it is difficult to treat cancer despite medical
advances (58.4%), that it is very difficult to regain one’s health
after a cancer diagnosis (55.8%), that individuals with a history of
cancer would not be able to make contributions to society (71.8%),
and that the working ability of these individuals would be reduced
even after treatment (56.1%). This suggests that low levels of
competence may be attributed to a history of cancer. Additionally,
individuals with a history of cancer are believed to be more
appreciative of life because of their experiences with cancer (Stan-
ton, 2006), suggesting that these individuals may be seen as warm.
Indeed, this notion is supported by retrospective research in which
individuals with a history of cancer report more positive interper-
sonal relationships as a result of their experiences with cancer,
possibly because they seek more meaningful and healthier rela-
tionships (e.g., Stanton, Bower, & Low, 2006). Other research that
compares those with a history of cancer to matched controls
without a history of cancer suggests that individuals with a history
of cancer report having closer interpersonal relationships with
others than individuals who do not have a history of cancer
(Andrykowski et al., 1996). Importantly, a recent study examined
the perceptions of warmth and competence of individuals with (vs.
without) a history of cancer and found the former were rated
higher in warmth and lower in competence (Clément-Guillotin,
Falzon, & d’Arripe-Longueville, 2014). Thus, the SCM provides a
useful tool to understand the stereotypes associated with people
with a history of cancer in the workplace.
A particular strength of the SCM is its ability to predict attitudinal
reactions to groups based on the stereotypes associated with those
groups. For example, groups that are perceived as being more warm
than competent tend to elicit paternalistic attitudes from others be-
cause of assumptions that these groups are noncompetitive and inca-
pable of causing harm. As a result, members of these groups are seen
as kind or friendly and tend to elicit feelings of pity and sympathy
related to the perception that they are not responsible for their negative
outcomes (Weiner, 1985). Examples of these groups include individ-
uals with intellectual or physical disabilities, “traditional” women, and
elderly individuals (Fiske et al., 2002). Consistent with these findings,
Cho, Choi, et al. (2013) found that the majority of participants agreed
that cancer survivors should be protected in society (56.6%). These
paternalistic attitudes are further evidence that individuals with a
history of cancer are likely to be perceived to be higher in warmth
than in competence.
In summary, the limited research on stereotypes related specifically
to individuals with a history of cancer suggests that these stereotypes
include perceptions that they are less healthy (and thus less compe-
tent); experience a greater appreciation for interpersonal relationships
(and thus are more warm); and elicit paternalistic, protective attitudes
from others, which tend to result from perceptions of higher warmth
than competence. Thus, we predict the following:
Hypothesis 1: Cancer survivors will be rated higher in per-
ceived warmth than in perceived competence.
Linking the SCM to Discriminatory Behavior Toward
Individuals With a History of Cancer
In day-to-day interactions, judgments of warmth tend to be
prioritized over judgments of competence because warmth—the
benevolent or malevolent intentions of others—is more critical to
interpersonal interactions (Cuddy et al., 2007, 2008). However,
Cuddy, Glick, and Beninger (2011) argue that judgments of com-
petence are likely prioritized over warmth in organizational con-
texts because the primary goal of most organizations is to recruit,
select, and maintain a highly competent workforce. Thus, in orga-
nizational contexts, perceptions of competence, and not warmth,
should more strongly dictate behavioral responses toward out-
groups. The Behaviors from Intergroup Affect and Stereotypes
(BIAS) Map (Cuddy et al., 2007) is an extension of the SCM that
links warmth and competence stereotypes to specific behaviors.
The BIAS Map predicts that perceptions of competence predict
passive (e.g., covert, less intense, avoidant) rather than active (e.g.,
direct, explicit, overt) behaviors (Cuddy et al., 2007, 2008). The
level of perceived competence will predict whether these passive
behaviors are harmful or facilitative. Harmful behaviors include

 those that lead to detrimental outcomes for outgroups, whereas
facilitative behaviors include those that lead to favorable outcomes
for outgroups (Cuddy et al., 2007).
Given that stereotypes linked to a history of cancer suggest low
competence (relative to warmth), a history of cancer should elicit
passive harm behaviors in organizational contexts (Cuddy et al.,
2007). Examples of passive harm behaviors include “avoiding eye
contact, being dismissive, and ignoring” others (Cuddy et al.,
2008, p. 109). Although subtle, these behaviors can constitute
“consequential forms of discrimination (e.g., passive segregation,
failure to hire members of a specific group)” (Cuddy et al., 2007).
For example, Cuddy, Fiske, and Glick (2004) found that working
mothers, stereotyped as being higher on warmth than in compe-
tence, were more likely to experience passive harm behaviors
including reduced likelihood of being hired, promoted, or receive
developmental training, which are all characterized as acts of
relatively passive acts of omission.
The present research focuses on three important phases of the
selection process: interacting with hiring personnel, being allowed
to submit an application, and receiving inquiries from hiring per-
sonnel to pursue employment (e.g., callbacks for interviews in
response to applications; Hebl, Foster, Mannix, & Dovidio, 2002).
Each of these contexts may elicit passive harm behaviors from
hiring personnel, as characterized by the BIAS Map (Cuddy et al.,
2007). Specifically, we propose the following:
Hypothesis 2: Hiring personnel will engage in more passive
harm behaviors toward applicants with a history (vs. no his-
tory) of cancer. These behaviors include negative interper-
sonal interactions (Hypothesis 2a), communicating lower job
availability (Hypothesis 2b), and engaging in fewer callbacks
(Hypothesis 2c) compared with applicants without a history of
cancer.
In the present research, two studies test the role of discrimina-
tion (passive harm) directed toward those with a history of cancer
in selection contexts by taking a three-pronged approach. We first
present the results of a pilot study that examines whether people
with a history of cancer elect to disclose this history in selection
contexts. In Study 1, we then present data that examines the nature
of stereotypes of cancer history in workplace settings. In Study 2
we investigate the ways that discrimination toward those with a
history of cancer manifests in actual selection scenarios.
Pilot Study: Do Individuals With a History of Cancer
Disclose in the Workplace?
We began by examining, across two samples, whether individ-
uals with a history of cancer actually disclose in selection contexts.
All participants were at least 18 years of age, lived in the United
States, and identified as “cancer survivors who are working part-
or full-time.” Eighty participants were recruited via Amazon Me-
chanical Turk (MTurk) and compensated $0.40. We recruited an
additional 112 participants at a Susan G. Komen fun-run event.
Descriptive statistics of these two samples are provided in Table 1.
Table 2 provides a summary of the specific questions and
responses collected across both samples. Most participants indi-
cated that they either would disclose or had previously disclosed
their cancer histories in selection contexts. Common reasons for
disclosure included health-related concerns, a desire to be forth-
right with interviewers, being directly asked about cancer, or
wanting to communicate that they were stronger as a result of their
cancer histories. Our initial results confirm that individuals with a
history of cancer do disclose, and at fairly high rates. We now
explore the stereotypes associated with individuals with a history
of cancer in workplace contexts (Study 1) and how these stereo-
types may affect actual hiring scenarios (Study 2).
Study 1: What Are the Stereotypes Associated With
Cancer Survivorship?
In this study, we assess ratings of warmth and competence attrib-
uted to people with a history of cancer. In addition, we compare the
ratings of people with a history of cancer to other groups identified in
previous SCM research (Fiske et al., 2002; see also Clement-Guillotin
et al., 2014). Specifically, we focus on a noncollege sample
within the United States, and we compare the ratings of warmth
and competence for individuals with a history of cancer to
ratings for White, Asian, and “poor” individuals. These groups
were chosen because they consistently represent the high-
warmth/high-competence, low-warmth/high-competence, and
low-warmth/low-competence quadrants outlined in the SCM in
previous research (Fiske et al., 2002), respectively.
Method
Participants.
Participants were 87 individuals recruited via
MTurk. Of these, 15 were removed because they did not provide any
variation in responses. On average, participants were 38.83 years
(SD � 13.29 years), the majority (54.90%) were employed full time,
and many had management experience (52.80%) and/or experience as
an interviewer (41.70%).1
1 We also conducted the analyses reported in this study using only
individuals with management experience and using only individuals with
interviewing experience. Neither of these restrictions resulted in substan-
tively different results for any analyses.

DISCRIMINATION RELATED TO CANCER HISTORY
 Procedure.
Participants took part in an online survey and
provided their opinions regarding “perceptions of individuals.”
They were asked to “respond honestly as to how most people in
society feel about individuals who have been diagnosed with,
treated for, and survived cancer” with respect to certain character-
istics. To assess workplace-specific stereotypes, we added “in the
workplace” to the stem of each item. Perceived competence and
warmth were measured using nine items (competence: competent,
confident, independent, competitive, intelligent; warmth: tolerant,
warm, good natured, sincere) on a 5-point rating scale (1 � not at
all, 5 � very much so) from Fiske et al. (2002). To compare with
other groups in the SCM framework, participants responded to the
same questions in reference to White, Asian, and poor individuals.
Results and Discussion
An initial exploratory principal components factor analysis of
the nine cancer items using promax rotation yielded two distinct
factors that accounted for 63.16% of the total variance. The two
factors replicated Fiske et al.’s (2002) distinction between warmth
(� � .80) and competence (� � .84). All factor loadings exceeded
.60, with no cross-loading across factors. Reliabilities for the
warmth and competence items with respect to the other three
groups all exceeded .61.
Following Fiske et al.’s (2002) procedure to establish within-
group differences along the two dimensions of competence and
warmth, a paired samples t test was used to compare the percep-
tions of competence and warmth with respect to those with a
history of cancer. In support of Hypothesis 1, these individuals
with a history of cancer were rated higher in warmth (M � 3.96,
SD � 0.63) than in competence (M � 3.54, SD � 0.73), t(65) �
4.57, p � .001, d � 0.56.
We next compared those with a history of cancer with people
representing other quadrants. As expected, those with a history of
cancer were rated higher in warmth than White individuals (M �
3.26, SD � 0.75), t(53) � 5.44, p � .001, d � 0.74, and lower in
competence than White individuals (M � 4.08, SD � 0.50),
t(53) � 4.03, p � .001, d � 0.63. Individuals with a history of
cancer were rated higher in warmth than Asians (M � 3.14, SD �
0.91), t(55) � 5.56, p � .001, d � 0.74, and lower in competence
than Asians (M � 4.32, SD � 0.50), t(55) � 6.50, p � .001, d �
0.87. Those with a history of cancer also were rated higher in
warmth than poor people (M � 3.01, SD � 0.92), t(54) � 6.83,
p � .001, d � 0.92, and higher in competence than poor people
(M � 2.12, SD � 0.75), t(54) � 10.99, p � .001, d � 1.48.
The results of Study 1 suggest that, in line with the SCM,
individuals with a history of cancer are rated higher in warmth than
they are in competence. Furthermore, warmth and competence
ratings from previous SCM research confirm that people with a
history of cancer are best classified in the high-warmth/low-
competence quadrant. Thus, corresponding with prior conceptual-
izations of SCM categories, we classify individuals with a history
of cancer in the high-warmth/low-competence quadrant of the
SCM.
Study 2: What Behaviors Result From
Cancer Stereotypes?
We now focus on how the content of these stereotypes may
manifest as discriminatory behaviors against individuals with a
history of cancer in actual hiring scenarios using a field study.
Based upon our review of the SCM, BIAS Map, and organizational
contextual factors, we predicted that individuals with a history of
cancer would receive passive harm behaviors.
Method
Participants and research confederates.
Participants were
121 managers of retail stores at three large shopping malls in a
major metropolitan city in the southern United States. The only
demographic information recorded of the managers was gender
(65% female). Five research confederates (two male and three
female) served as applicants. All of these confederate applicants
were between 21 and 29 years of age. For each study trial,
applicants were assigned randomly to disclose a history of
cancer or provide no information about a history of cancer.
Prior to data collection, we confirmed that each store was
currently hiring and we excluded stores that utilized a com-
pletely online application process. Finally, applicants were as-
signed randomly to each store and only one applicant entered
any given store.
Manipulations and training.
Manipulation of cancer status.
The confederates presented
resumes to managers that included their actual employment expe-
riences. The resumes were adjusted to fit the work history and job
requirements appropriate for an individual applying to a sales
associate position at a retail store by omitting any overqualifica-
tions and irrelevant work experiences, and were standardized
across confederates for length, formatting, and level of experience
or impressiveness.

MARTINEZ, WHITE, SHAPIRO, AND HEBL
 In the experimental condition, confederates wore hats and pro-
vided resumes that disclosed cancer survivor status. The resumes
included the following statement, “Please note: There is a gap in
my employment because I was diagnosed and treated for cancer. I
have been in remission for one year” and the hat had the words
“Cancer Survivor” depicted across the front. In the control condi-
tion, the resume provided no extra information and participants
wore a plain white hat. Finally, it is important to note that all
confederates served as their own control—they entered some
stores wearing the “Cancer Survivor” hat and other stores with the
plain white hat. Confederate applicants remained blind to condi-
tion.
Training and standardization.
The confederates received ex-
tensive training in order to standardize the interactions. In addition,
the confederates asked four standard questions of all managers: (a)
“Are you hiring right now?”; (b) “Can I fill out an application?”;
(c) “What sorts of things would I be doing if I worked here?”; and
(d) “When should I expect to hear from you?” The confederates
did not deviate from this predetermined script unless the manager
had follow-up questions, in which case the confederate was to act
naturally but not overengage.
Procedure.
The experimental paradigm for the present
study was one adapted from previous organizational field re-
search (Hebl et al., 2002; Singletary & Hebl, 2009). Before
entering each store, a research assistant placed a hat on the
confederate’s head and handed them the corresponding resume.
To remain blind to condition, confederates did not look at the
resume and avoided reflective surfaces. Upon entering each
store, confederates asked to speak with a manager and then
asked the four standardized questions. If the manager stated that
the store was hiring, the confederate took an application and left
a resume with the manager. Conversely, if the manager indi-
cated the store was not hiring, the confederate thanked them,
exited the store, and noted this response on a rating form that
also included the focal dependent variables. All applications
were completed in a standardized way and returned the same
day. If managers contacted the confederate regarding the posi-
tion, the confederates politely indicated that they were appre-
ciative of the response but were no longer seeking employment.
Measures.
Interpersonal interactions.
Passive harm was measured with
items used in previous field research assessing subtle interper-
sonal discriminatory behaviors (e.g., Hebl et al., 2002). Con-
federate job applicants evaluated the manager on 13 dimen-
sions: friendliness (reverse coded [R]), eye contact (R), smiling
(R), helpfulness (R), level of interest (R), comfort (R), nodding
(R), rudeness, pursing lips, negative brow furrowing, hostility,
and nervousness. Each item was rated on a 7-point Likert scale
(1 � not at all, 7 � very much). These variables showed high
reliability (� � .92), and were averaged into one composite,
Passive Harm, with higher ratings indicating more negative
interpersonal behaviors.
Application.
For each applicant, we noted whether or not the
employer indicated that there was an open position available and
allowed the applicant to submit an application.
Callbacks.
For each applicant, we noted whether or not the
employer called the applicant to offer them a job within a 3-month
period of time following the initial data collection.
Results and Discussion
None of the managers specifically mentioned the applicant’s hat
during the interactions. An analysis of variance examining the
effects of individual applicants revealed no statistically significant
differences on ratings of Passive Harm as a result of individual
confederates, F(4, 116) � 1.18, p � .05, �2 � .04, or confederate
gender, F(1, 119) � 2.46, p � .05, �2 � .02. Similar tests revealed
that there were not systematic effects related to the particular mall,
F(2, 118) � 1.712, p � .05, �2 � .03, or type of store, F(2, 118) �
0.10, p � .05, �2 � .001, that was visited. Thus, we collapse
across confederates, confederate gender, mall, and store type in
further analyses.
Passive harm.
Consistent with Hypothesis 2a, applicants in
the cancer disclosure condition reported significantly more passive
harm from the hiring personnel (M � 3.21, SD � .97) compared
with applicants in the control condition (M � 2.34, SD � 0.81),
F(1, 119) � 30.89, p � .001, �2 � .21.
Application.
Hypotheses 2b and 2c were evaluated using
Fisher’s exact test, which provides the statistical significance of
differences for contingency tables in which the actual (rather than
inferred from a larger population) phenomenon of interest is avail-
able. There were no differences as a function of condition in the
number of managers offering prospective applicants an opportu-
nity to apply for the job (one-sided Fisher’s exact test, p � .39).
Specifically, six stores indicated that they were not hiring in the
control condition and eight stores indicated they were not hiring in
the cancer disclosure condition. Hence, although the pattern of
data is in the predicted direction, Hypothesis 2b was not supported.
Callbacks.
Consistent with Hypothesis 2c, prospective appli-
cants in the cancer disclosure condition received fewer callbacks
from hiring personnel (n � 13; 21.3%) than those in the control
condition (n � 22; 36.7%; one-sided Fisher’s exact test, p � .05).
The results of Study 2 revealed that individuals with a history of
cancer were treated with higher levels of passive harm (worse
interpersonal treatment, fewer callbacks) by managers. However,
these individuals were allowed to apply for jobs at comparable
levels, a finding that is contrary to predictions but perhaps in line
with legal concerns. The differences in passive harm are striking,
given that the interactions were highly structured (because of the
standardized training the confederates received) and short in
length. These findings cannot be attributed to demand character-
istics or self-fulfilling prophecy, as the confederates were blind to
the manipulation in each encounter.
General Discussion
The purpose of the present research was to examine the return-
to-work experiences of individuals with a history of cancer. Al-
though past research suggests that these individuals are prone to
higher incidences of unemployment (de Boer et al., 2006, 2009),
little is known about the psychological mechanisms that may
explain this phenomenon in selection contexts. Our pilot study
demonstrated that individuals with a history of cancer often decide
to disclose this fact to interviewers. Study 1 demonstrated that the
stereotypes associated with these individuals include perceptions
that they are higher in warmth than competence. Finally, Study 2
demonstrated that, in accordance with the tenets of the SCM and
BIAS Map, applicants that ostensibly had a history of cancer
received more passive harm behaviors from store personnel, in-

DISCRIMINATION RELATED TO CANCER HISTORY
 cluding worse interpersonal treatment (Hebl et al., 2002) and fewer
callbacks compared with applicants that did not report a history of
cancer.
Theoretical and Practical Implications
The present research adds to a relatively small body of literature
focused on the psychosocial aspects of cancer survivorship in the
workplace and suggests that the stereotypes associated with cancer
history may be at least partially responsible for the lower employ-
ment rates reported in other studies. By utilizing an experimental
field research paradigm, we can rule out that alternative explana-
tions (such as changing priorities regarding employment and indi-
viduals deciding not to return to work after treatment; see Mols,
Thong, Vreugdenhil, & van de Poll-Franse, 2009) account for
differences in rates of employability.
Our methodology also provides an extension of the SCM and
BIAS Map scholarship. Although past studies have utilized exper-
imentation to test the predictions of the SCM, most have relied
upon hypothetical situations or target groups (Caprariello et al.,
2009). By collecting data in actual organizational settings among
managers who were unaware that they were being exposed to
manipulations, we provide evidence that the propositions of the
SCM manifest in the “real world.” Moreover, the BIAS Map
predicts two possible behaviors in response to a given outgroup,
yet does not describe when one behavior is more likely than
another. We proposed that the workplace context would encourage
more passive (rather than active) behavioral responses. Taking the
context into account will likely prove to be a lucrative area of
future SCM research, particularly in predicting which behaviors
are likely to be elicited in response to different outgroups.
In terms of practical implications, it seems counterintuitive that
individuals with a history of cancer would choose to willingly
disclose information that may make them more vulnerable to
discrimination. Indeed, hiring personnel in Study 2 made fewer
callbacks and displayed more negative interpersonal reactions to
individuals who displayed a history with cancer than those who did
not, despite the fact that applicant qualifications and behaviors
were standardized. This lower rate of callbacks is evidence of
systematic exclusion based on history of cancer, which can leave
employers at risk of biased selection decisions and potential liti-
gation. Thus, hiring personnel should be mindful to base such
decisions on performance-related characteristics only.
Despite this discrimination, our pilot study showed that individ-
uals do choose to disclose a cancer history in selection contexts.
This may be related to the fact that a diagnosis of cancer and the
experience of undergoing treatment and recovery are often very
traumatic events, and many of these individuals can come to
incorporate their histories with cancer as a central parts of their
self-concepts (see Parry & Chesler, 2005; Zebrack, 2000). Given
that these individuals may feel compelled to disclose in selection
or other workplace contexts, it is important for leaders within
organizations to be prepared to handle such disclosures. An inter-
viewer that allowed a disclosure of cancer history to impact
decisions to hire an applicant that is otherwise capable of perform-
ing the job would be at risk of making suboptimal selection
decisions and litigation for violating the tenets of the Americans
with Disabilities Act (1990).
Furthermore, engaging in negative interpersonal behaviors like
we found in Study 2 could create a self-fulfilling prophecy among
applicants in which they perceive negativity from hiring personnel
and thus form negative impressions about the job. This negative
impression would then be communicated to hiring personnel, who
would determine that they are either not interested in the job or
would not be a good fit for the organization. It has been shown that
these negative interpersonal interactions can indeed affect inter-
view performance, giving hiring personnel justified reasons to not
hire the applicant (Word, Zanna, & Cooper, 1974).
Finally, there are implications for individual employees with a
history of cancer. The present research suggests that the perceived
competence of these potential employees may be a barrier to
employment. Thus, individuals with a history of cancer may be
able to allay concerns about their competence by highlighting
positive aspects about their experiences and specifically address-
ing concerns employers may have.
Limitations and Future Directions
We presumed that employers perceived that our control appli-
cant did not have a history of cancer. Similarly, we have concep-
tualized the discrimination experienced by the applicant in the
experimental condition to emerge as a result of the applicant’s
history of cancer. However, it may be the case that this discrimi-
nation emerged as a result of disclosing a history of cancer. The
present research does not allow us to differentiate between these
hypotheses. This is a problem inherent to any stigmatizing char-
acteristic that is concealable—one can avoid prejudice and dis-
crimination related to the characteristic if one is able to conceal it
and does not disclose its presence. Hence, the present research
adds to the growing literature on the double bind of the negative
implications of both concealing and revealing concealable stigmas.
The present findings stand in contrast to a growing body of work
suggesting the benefits that some groups receive from explicitly
acknowledging their stigmas (e.g., Singletary & Hebl, 2009). Fu-
ture research will benefit from continuing to explore the implica-
tions of concealing versus disclosing a history of cancer, especially
considering the relatively high rates of disclosure found in our
pilot study.
Future research would benefit from continuing to explore
health-related stigma in the workplace. The present research did
not specify the type of cancer experienced by the applicant, which
may constitute a fruitful avenue of future research, particularly if
the cancer is perceived to be the result of controllable factors (e.g.,
a smoker’s lung cancer; Weiner, 1985).
Conclusion
Although diversity efforts have increased over the past decade,
health characteristics are often not included in these programs.
Individuals with a history of cancer make up a large proportion of
the potential workforce, and return to work has tremendous eco-
nomic and psychological benefits for these individuals (e.g., Brad-
ley & Bednarek, 2002). Hence, it will be essential for organiza-
tions to address discrimination related to cancer history (and other
health outcomes) in interventions designed to create equity in
hiring practices.
