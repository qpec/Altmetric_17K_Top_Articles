Introduction 
 
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a pathological 
condition characterized by an abnormal, localized dilata-
tion of the lower part of the aorta  
[1] 
. The general con-
sensus for defining an AAA is aortic diameter  
≥ 
1.5 times 
the normal diameter at the level of the renal arteries, 
which typically equates to a minimum diameter of 3.0 cm 
to be considered an AAA  
[2] 
. The prevalence of AAA has 
previously been shown to be approximately 4–5% among 
adults over 50 years of age, although it is several times 
more common in men than in women  
[3–5] 
.
 
The United States Preventive Services Task Force 
(USPSTF) currently recommends one-time screening for 
AAA in men aged 65–75 years who have ever smoked and 
recommends that clinicians selectively offer screening
for AAA in men who have never smoked. However, the 
USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insuffi-

Abstract 
 
Objectives: 
 Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a patholog-
ical condition characterized by an abnormal, localized dilata-
tion of the lower part of the aorta. Due to a lack of data on 
the natural history of AAA and risk of death from other car-
diovascular diseases attributable to AAA, the true number of 
AAA-attributable deaths may be higher than currently esti-
mated. This study aims to produce more realistic estimates 
of the burden of AAA.  
Methods: 
 A disease-modeling soft-
ware, DisMod II, was used to assess the AAA burden via a 
multistate life table. Inputs included population, all-cause 
mortality, size- and sex-specific AAA prevalence, and relative 
risk of death estimates for persons with AAA compared with 
persons without AAA.  
Results: 
 There were 2,347,339 preva-
lent cases of AAA in the USA in 2013 (95% CI: 2,131,964–
2,524,116), resulting in 41,371 deaths attributable to AAA 
(95% CI: 34,090–49,234). Females constituted 21.1% of prev-
alent cases and 45.2% of deaths, compared with males con-
stituting 78.9% of prevalent cases and 54.8% of deaths.

clusions: This work shows that the burden of mortality at-

cient to assess the balance of harms and benefits of screen-
ing for AAA in women aged 65–75 years who have ever 
smoked, and it recommends against the routine screen-
ing for AAA in women who have never smoked  
[6] 
. 
 
 
Due to implementation of the Screening Abdominal 
Aortic Aneurysms Very Efficiently (SAAAVE) Act in 
January 2007, Medicare began covering the costs of a one-
time ultrasound screening of men aged 65–75 years who 
ever smoked in their lifetime, or men and women who 
have a family history of AAA. However, this is a fairly 
narrow screening program, and it has been shown that 
the SAAAVE Act has had no discernable effect on AAA 
rupture or all-cause mortality  
[7] 
. 
 
 
AAA patients have a higher prevalence of cardiovas-
cular risk factors compared with those without AAA, as 
well as an increased risk of death due to aneurysm rupture 
 
[8, 9] 
. In a retrospective analysis of the National Inpatient 
Sample, the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient 
health care database in the USA, patients with ruptured 
AAA had a 39% in-hospital mortality rate  
[10] 
. Even 
among patients with successful repair of AAA, the aver-
age life expectancy is lower than in the general population 
 
[11] 
. 
 
According to the American Heart Association, in 2010 
there were 16,417 any-mention deaths attributable to 
thoracic aortic aneurysm or AAA  
[12] 
. However, this 
number of aneurysm-related deaths may underestimate 
the true number of deaths due to the fact that patients 
with AAA ruptures outside of the hospital may not sur-
vive the trip to receive care  
[5] 
. According to a system-
atic review and meta-analysis, 32% of patients with AAA 
ruptures die before reaching the hospital  
[13] 
. 
 
Few data are available on the natural history of AAA 
and risk of death from other cardiovascular diseases at-
tributable to AAA. Due to the relatively high prevalence 
of AAA among the elderly population, it is reasonable to 
assume that the true number of AAA-attributable deaths 
could be expected to be much higher than previously es-
timated. 
 
Methods 
 
This study used a disease-modeling software, DisMod II, devel-
oped by the World Health Organization for the Global Burden of 
Disease 2000 study. This has previously been used to model the 
burden of a wide range of other diseases, such as diabetes  
[14, 15] 
, 
multiple sclerosis  
[16] 
, schizophrenia  
[17] 
, and malaria  
[18] 
. The 
mathematical model of DisMod II is a multistate life table describ-
ing a single disease, where transition hazards define the relation-
ships between three states: healthy, diseased, and dead  
[19] ( 
fig. 1 
). 
Those in the healthy state are defined as people being unaffected 
by the disease of interest. They are exposed to an incidence transi-
tion hazard, which may lead to them moving into the diseased 
state. From the diseased state they are exposed to a hazard of dying 
from the disease or a hazard of remission. The hazard of mortality 
from all other causes is the same for those in either the healthy or 
diseased state. A set of differential equations defines the relation-
ships between the states and transition hazards, and allows for the 
calculation of the number of people in each state.
 
Input data for this study consisted of: age- and sex-specific pop-
ulation; age- and sex-specific all-cause mortality; size- and sex-
specific AAA prevalence, and relative risk (RR) estimates of death 
for persons with AAA compared with persons without AAA, ad-
justed for age, ethnicity, height, weight, smoking, and cardiovas-
cular disease history. AAA prevalence and RR estimates were seg-
mented by size of aneurysm, where small AAA refers to aneurysms 
with an infrarenal diameter of 3.0–3.9 cm and large AAA refers to 
aneurysms with an infrarenal diameter of  
≥ 
4.0 cm.

Population data by sex and age were obtained from the United 
States Census Bureau’
s American FactFinder database  
[20] 
. All-
cause mortality data by sex and age were obtained from the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention’
s National Vital Statistics Sys-
tem  
[21] 
. Estimates for prevalence came from results of the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs Aneurysm Detection and Manage-
ment (ADAM) study  
[4] 
. The ADAM study represents the largest 
AAA epidemiological study that involves the inclusion of women. 
A cubic spline interpolation curve was used to extend the preva-
lence estimates from 50–79 years to  
≥ 
50 years. Measures of RR of 
death for those with AAA came from the Cardiovascular Health 
Study, a longitudinal cohort study from the UK  
[22] 
. Confidence 
intervals (CI) were calculated within DisMod II via a Monte Carlo 
simulation (parametric bootstrapping). 
 
Results 
 
The numbers of calculated prevalent cases and AAA-
attributable deaths based on the model are presented in 
 
tables 1 and  
2 
, respectively. There were 2,347,339 total 
prevalent cases of AAA (95% CI: 2,131,964–2,524,116) 
resulting in 41,371 AAA-attributable deaths (95% CI: 
34,090–49,234). Among males, there were 1,853,116 
prevalent cases (95% CI: 1,686,511–1,995,377) and 22,680 
AAA-attributable deaths (95% CI: 18,472–28,922), repre-
senting 78.9% of the total prevalent cases and 54.8% of
the total AAA-attributable deaths, respectively. Among 
females, there were 494,223 prevalent cases (95% CI: 
445,453–528,739) and 18,691 AAA-attributable deaths 
(95% CI: 15,618–20,312), representing 21.1% of the total 
prevalent cases and 45.2% of the total AAA-attributable 
deaths, respectively. The 22,680 deaths among males ac-
counted for 1.7% of male all-cause deaths in 2013, while 
the 18,691 deaths among females accounted for 1.5% of 
female all-cause deaths. Combined, AAAs were respon-
sible for 1.6% of all-cause deaths in 2013. 
 
 
Small AAAs accounted for 72.7% of the total prevalent 
cases and 59.1% of total AAA-attributable deaths. Among 
males, 68.7% of prevalent cases and 33.1% of AAA-attrib-
utable deaths were due to small AAAs. 87.9% of female 
prevalent cases and 90.8% of female AAA-attributable 
deaths were due to small AAAs. Large AAAs accounted 
for 27.3% of total prevalent cases and 40.9% of total AAA-
attributable deaths. Among males, large AAAs accounted 
for 31.3% of prevalent cases and 66.9% of AAA-attribut-
able deaths, compared with 12.1% of prevalent cases and 
9.2% of AAA-attributable deaths among females. 
 
Among those  
≥ 
55 years of age, the AAA-attributable 
proportion of all-cause deaths increased to a peak be-
tween 75 and 84 years ( 
fig. 2 
). For males in both age 
groups of 75–79 and 80–84 years, AAA-attributable 
deaths accounted for 3.0% of all-cause deaths, compared 
with 1.9% for females in both age groups of 75–79 and 
80–84 years. 
 
Discussion 
 
Modeling the burden of AAA using the DisMod II 
program resulted in over twice as many deaths attribut-
able to AAA as current estimates by the American Heart 
Association. Interestingly, the results showed that fe-
males accounted for a disproportionately high percentage 
of total AAA-attributable deaths, 45.2%, despite only ac-
counting for 27.3% of the total prevalent cases. 
 
 
AAA-attributable deaths due to large AAAs repre-
sented a more significant burden among males than fe-

males: 66.9 versus 9.2%, respectively. This is most likely 
due to the lower prevalence of large AAAs among women 
(0.12%) compared with men (1.34%)  
[4] 
.
 
This study suggests that while AAA is less common 
among females than males, it is more likely to result in 
death. Among males, there were 81.7 prevalent cases of 
AAA per each AAA-attributable death, whereas among 
females this ratio is much lower at only 26.4 prevalent 
cases per death. These results are in line with other re-
search stating that although females are generally pro-
tected from the development of AAAs, the ones that do 
develop behave more aggressively with higher growth 
and rupture rates  
[23] 
.
 
Due to females having a disproportionately high per-
centage of total AAA-attributable deaths, as well as a lower 
ratio of prevalent cases to deaths compared with males, it 
is not unreasonable to suggest that perhaps current screen-
ing procedures for AAA should be expanded to include a 
more focused effort on identifying affected females. 
 
The aim of this study was to provide more realistic es-
timates of the burden of AAA. However, there are some 
important limitations. The prevalence estimates include 
both diagnosed and undiagnosed patients, and cubic 
spline interpolation was used in order to apply these esti-
mates to the entire population aged  
≥ 
50 years rather than 
only 50–79 years as reported in the ADAM study. Also, 
due to a lack of available data, the RR of death input was 
taken from a study conducted in the UK and used in this 
model to estimate the disease burden in the USA. It is pos-
sible that there are underlying factors that would result in 
risk values differing between these countries, although 
according to the World Health Organization the UK and 
USA have comparable age-standardized mortality rates 
due to cardiovascular disease  
[24] 
. There are also ele-
ments of DisMod II that are subjective to the researcher, 
such as using various statistical means of smoothing in-
put variables or using different weights for input vari-
ables. Using DisMod II is an interactive exercise, and the 
output results of the model may differ based on how the 
researcher utilizes different settings. Inconsistency of 
cross-sectional variables describing a disease may be real 
or deceptive, and there are inherent difficulties in com-
bining measurements from different sources  
[25] 
. De-
spite these potential limitations, the results of this study 
demonstrate that the burden of deaths attributable to 
AAA may be considerably higher than current estimates 
suggest, particularly among females.
