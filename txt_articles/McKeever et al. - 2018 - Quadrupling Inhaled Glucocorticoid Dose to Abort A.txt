BACKGROUND
Asthma exacerbations are frightening for patients and are occasionally fatal. We 
tested the concept that a plan for patients to manage their asthma (self-manage-
ment plan), which included a temporary quadrupling of the dose of inhaled gluco-
corticoids when asthma control started to deteriorate, would reduce the incidence 
of severe asthma exacerbations among adults and adolescents with asthma.
METHODS
We conducted a pragmatic, unblinded, randomized trial involving adults and adoles-
cents with asthma who were receiving inhaled glucocorticoids, with or without add-
on therapy, and who had had at least one exacerbation in the previous 12 months. 
We compared a self-management plan that included an increase in the dose of 
inhaled glucocorticoids by a factor of 4 (quadrupling group) with the same plan 
without such an increase (non-quadrupling group), over a period of 12 months. 
The primary outcome was the time to a first severe asthma exacerbation, defined 
as treatment with systemic glucocorticoids or an unscheduled health care consul-
tation for asthma.
RESULTS
A total of 1922 participants underwent randomization, of whom 1871 were in-
cluded in the primary analysis. The number of participants who had a severe 
asthma exacerbation in the year after randomization was 420 (45%) in the quadru-
pling group as compared with 484 (52%) in the non-quadrupling group, with an 
adjusted hazard ratio for the time to a first severe exacerbation of 0.81 (95% 
confidence interval, 0.71 to 0.92; P 
= 
0.002). The rate of adverse effects, which were 
related primarily to local effects of inhaled glucocorticoids, was higher in the 
quadrupling group than in the non-quadrupling group.
CONCLUSIONS
In this trial involving adults and adolescents with asthma, a personalized self-
management plan that included a temporary quadrupling of the dose of inhaled 
glucocorticoids when asthma control started to deteriorate resulted in fewer severe 
asthma exacerbations than a plan in which the dose was not increased. (Funded 
by the Health Technology Assessment Programme of the National Institute for 
Health Research; Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN15441965.)

Quadrupling Inhaled Glucocorticoid Dose
A
sthma is one of the most common 
chronic diseases, with an estimated 300 
million people affected worldwide.1 Acute 
exacerbations of asthma are frightening for pa-
tients, cause considerable illness and death, and 
account for a large proportion of the overall 
costs related to asthma.2
Although plans for patients to manage their 
asthma (self-management plans) have been shown 
to improve asthma control,3 the previously rec-
ommended step of doubling the dose of inhaled 
glucocorticoids when asthma control is deterio-
rating is ineffective at preventing acute exacer-
bations.4,5 Although some guidelines suggest a 
greater increase in the dose of inhaled glucocor-
ticoids, a 2016 Cochrane review concluded that 
it is unlikely that increasing the dose of inhaled 
glucocorticoids reduces the odds of systemic 
glucocorticoid use or hospitalization or shortens 
recovery time.6
A large, pragmatic trial was therefore com-
missioned by the Health Technology Assessment 
Programme of the National Institute for Health 
Research in the United Kingdom. We performed 
an individually randomized, unblinded, pragmat-
ic, multicenter trial involving adults and adoles-
cents to test the hypothesis that a self-manage-
ment plan that included a temporary increase in 
the dose of inhaled glucocorticoids by a factor of 
4 when asthma control started to deteriorate 
would reduce the use of oral glucocorticoids or 
unscheduled health care consultations for asth-
ma as compared with a plan that did not include 
this step.
Methods
Trial Oversight
The North West–Greater Manchester South NHS 
Research Ethics Committee approved the proto-
col. The last author vouches for the completeness 
and accuracy of the data and analyses and for 
the fidelity of the trial to the protocol (available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). 
Written informed consent was obtained from 
each participant before inclusion in the trial.
Population
Patients 16 years of age or older with a clinical 
diagnosis of asthma who were receiving any 
United Kingdom–licensed dose of inhaled gluco-
corticoids, with or without add-on medication, 
and who had had at least one exacerbation lead-
ing to treatment with systemic glucocorticoids 
in the previous 12 months were eligible to par-
ticipate. (For further details, see the Methods 
section in the Supplementary Appendix, avail-
able at NEJM.org.)
Intervention and Randomization
We compared two self-management plans that 
were based on a plan developed by Asthma UK 
and used in the United Kingdom at the time of 
trial design (Figs. S1 and S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). The plans were identical other 
than zone 2 of the plans. Zone 1 described well-
controlled asthma and recommended continua-
tion of current treatment. Zone 2 described de-
teriorating asthma control and recommended 
increased bronchodilator medication and an in-
crease in the dose of inhaled glucocorticoids by 
a factor of 4 (quadrupling group) or increased 
bronchodilator medication alone (non-quadru-
pling group) (Table 1). (For details, see the 
Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix 
and the protocol.7) Zones 3 and 4 described the 
development of an exacerbation and when to 
start oral glucocorticoids and seek medical in-
tervention (zone 3) and what to do in the event 
of a life-threatening exacerbation (zone 4). Par-
ticipants were sent an automated text message 
every month to remind them to follow their self-
management plan. Additional glucocorticoid in-
halers that were required to achieve a quadru-
pling of the dose were provided free of charge.
A Web-based randomization system was used 
to assign participants to the quadrupling group 
or non-quadrupling group in permuted blocks 
of randomly varying size. Randomization was 
stratified according to trial site (regional center), 
current smoking status (yes vs. no), and mainte-
nance dose of inhaled glucocorticoids (high 
[>1000 μg per day of beclomethasone or the 
equivalent] vs. low [≤1000 μg per day of beclo-
methasone or the equivalent]). The participants 
and local research team were aware of the trial-
group assignments at randomization. The trial 
management group, statistician, and chief in-
vestigator were unaware of the trial-group as-
signments until the analysis was complete. (For 
details, see the Methods section in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.)

Outcome Measurements
The primary outcome was the time to a first 
severe asthma exacerbation, defined as treatment 
with systemic glucocorticoids or an unscheduled 
health care consultation for asthma. Scheduled 
visits occurred at 6 months and 12 months after 
randomization. For participants who were lost 
to follow-up, site staff attempted to review elec-
tronic patient records to document whether they 
had had an asthma-related general-practice ap-
pointment or had been prescribed systemic gluco-
corticoids during the trial period.
Secondary outcomes included the number of 
participants who had a severe exacerbation, the 
area under the curve of the morning peak expi-
ratory flow 2 weeks after activation of zone 2 of 
the self-management plan, the change in score 
on the Mini Asthma Quality of Life Question-
naire (Mini-AQLQ; scores range from 1 to 7, 
with higher values indicating better quality of life; 
minimal important difference, 0.5)8 2 weeks af-
ter activation of zone 2 of the self-management 
plan, and the cumulative dose of inhaled and 
systemic glucocorticoids used in the 12 months 
after randomization. (For details, see the Meth-
ods section in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Safety
Adverse events and serious adverse events relat-
ing to established adverse effects of inhaled 
glucocorticoids were reported during the 14 days 
after activation of zone 2 of the self-management 
plan. After a request from the data monitoring 
committee, cases of pneumonia were reported 
for up to 4 weeks after activation of zone 2.
Statistical Analysis
A group of local general practitioners, asthma 
nurses, and asthma experts suggested that a 
reduction of one third in the number of people 
initiating a course of systemic glucocorticoids is 
a worthwhile treatment effect. With 1000 partici-
pants per group, a log-rank test (at the two-sided 
5% significance level) had at least 90% power to 
detect a between-group difference of 30% (rela-
tive effect), with the assumption of an exacerba-
tion rate of 13% in the non-quadrupling group.4,9 
We initially proposed to recruit 2300 patients to 
allow for withdrawals and losses to follow-up, 
but this was reduced in March 2015 to a mini-
mum of 1774 because the combined primary-
outcome rate was higher than expected. (For 
details, see the section on sample size in the 
protocol.7)
All analyses were conducted with the use 
of Stata software, version 13.1 (StataCorp). Cox 
proportional-hazards regression was used to 
analyze the primary outcome, including the 
randomization-stratification variables, the dose 
of inhaled glucocorticoids (high vs. low), and 
smoking status (never smoked vs. former smoker 
vs. current smoker) as covariates and using a 
shared-frailty model to account for stratification 
according to regional center. Participants were 
included in analyses according to their random-
ized group, regardless of their adherence to their

assigned self-management plan. All the par-
ticipants were included in the analysis of the 
primary outcome, except for those who had no 
further contact after randomization and had 
no data on systemic glucocorticoid use or un-
scheduled health care consultations for asth-
ma. A sensitivity analysis that included all the 
participants was performed. (For details, see 
the Methods section in the Supplementary Ap-

Results
Participants
We wrote to approximately 30,000 potential pa-
tients from general-practice and volunteer data-
bases and also used posters, social media, and 
face-to-face discussions in clinics to recruit pa-
tients. A total of 4811 patients were screened, of 
whom 1922 underwent randomization (957 to the 
quadrupling group and 965 to the non-quadru-
pling group). All the participants received their 
assigned self-management plan, although 51 (3%) 
were excluded from the primary analysis, pri-
marily owing to being lost to follow-up and hav-
ing no outcome data. A total of 933 participants 
in the quadrupling group and 938 participants in 
the non-quadrupling group were included in the 
primary analysis (Fig. 1). Participants were en-
rolled from May 2013 through January 2016, and 
follow-up was completed by March 2017.
A total of 81% of recruited participants were 
identified in primary care and 19% in secondary 
care. The mean (±SD) age of the participants 
was 57±15 years, 1305 participants (68%) were 
female, 1495 (78%) were receiving 1000 μg or 
less per day of beclomethasone (or equivalent 
glucocorticoid), and 1344 (70%) were using a 
long-acting beta-agonist–inhaled glucocorticoid 
combination inhaler at the time of randomiza-
tion. A total of 1116 participants (58%) had 
never smoked, 125 (7%) were current smokers, 
and 681 (35%) were former smokers. Character-
istics at baseline were well balanced between the 
two treatment groups (Table 2).
Attendance at the scheduled visits was similar 
in the two groups. A total of 773 participants 
(81%) in quadrupling group and 772 (80%) in 
the non-quadrupling group attended the 6-month 
visit, and 679 (71%) and 700 (73%), respectively, 
attended the 12-month visit.
Outcomes
Of the 1922 participants, 1114 (58%) reached 
zone 2 or higher of their self-management plan 
at some point during follow-up (562 participants 
in the quadrupling group and 552 participants in 
the non-quadrupling group). The number of par-
ticipants who reported a severe exacerbation of 
asthma in the year after randomization was 420 
(45%) in the quadrupling group as compared 
with 484 (52%) in the non-quadrupling group, 
yielding an adjusted hazard ratio for the time to 
a first exacerbation of 0.81 (95% confidence in-

Quadrupling Inhaled Glucocorticoid Dose
terval [CI], 0.71 to 0.92; P 
= 
0.002) (Fig. 2). Ad-
ditional adjustment for age, sex, and peak flow 
at randomization had little effect on the hazard 
ratio (0.80; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.92; P 
= 
0.001). There 
was also little difference in the hazard ratio ac-
cording to smoking status or dose of inhaled 
glucocorticoids (high vs. low) at randomization 
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). A sen-
sitivity analysis that included all 1922 partici-
pants yielded a hazard ratio for the time to a 
first exacerbation of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.92).
The percentage of participants who used sys-
temic glucocorticoids was lower in the quadru-
pling group than in the non-quadrupling group, 
as was the percentage of participants who had 
unscheduled health care consultations for asth-
ma. A total of 311 participants (33%) in the 
quadrupling group versus 377 (40%) in the non-
quadrupling group started systemic glucocorti-
coids, with a mean number of courses of 0.50 
versus 0.61 (incidence rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 
0.70 to 0.96). A total of 379 participants (41%) in 
the quadrupling group versus 442 (47%) in the 
non-quadrupling group had an unscheduled 
health care consultation, with a mean total num-
ber of visits of 0.73 versus 0.84 (incidence rate 
ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.99). (For details, 
see Tables S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.)
Self-reported adherence to the instruction to 
quadruple or to not adjust the dose of inhaled 
glucocorticoids was similar in the two groups. 
Among participants with a reported activation of 
zone 2, 50% of those in the quadrupling group 
and 42% of those in the non-quadrupling group 
were judged by the researcher as having good 
adherence, and 6% and 3%, respectively, were 
judged as having poor adherence. No informa-
tion was available for 28% and 39% of the par-
ticipants in the respective groups.
Approximately 47% of the participants had a 
peak-flow value recorded on activation of zone 2 
of their self-management plan and at least one 
value on or after day 10 (54% of those in the 
quadrupling group and 41% of those in the non-
quadrupling group). From these values, the mean 
area under the curve of the peak flow was 1166 
liters per minute per day in the quadrupling 
group and 1130 liters per minute per day in the 
non-quadrupling group (adjusted difference in 
means, 38 liters per minute per day; 95% CI, 13 
to 62; 529 participants) (Table S4 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Similarly, Mini-AQLQ data 
after the first activation of zone 2 was available 
for only 45% of the participants, with data avail-
able for more participants in the quadrupling 
group than in the non-quadrupling group (50% 
vs. 39%). The mean Mini-AQLQ score 2 weeks 
after zone 2 activation was also higher in the 
quadrupling group, with an adjusted difference in 
means of 0.20 (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.46; 499 partici-
pants) (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Among participants who attended the 12-month 
follow-up visit, the estimated mean total dose of 
inhaled glucocorticoids taken in the 12 months 
after randomization was 385 mg in the quadru-
pling group (679 participants) and 328 mg in the 
non-quadrupling group (700 participants). The 
mean total dose of systemic glucocorticoids was 
121 mg and 151 mg, respectively.
In the 14 days after zone 2 activation, 11 par-
ticipants (2%) in the quadrupling group (9 receiv-
ing a high maintenance dose of inhaled gluco-
corticoids) reported a total of 11 serious adverse 
events, and 22 participants (4%) in the non-
quadrupling group (8 receiving a high mainte-
nance dose of inhaled glucocorticoids) reported 
a total of 32 serious adverse events. The most

common serious adverse event was hospitalization 
for asthma, occurring 3 times in the quadrupling 
group and 18 times in the non-quadrupling group. 
Because these events also fulfill the criteria for 
the primary outcome, they are included in the 
primary outcome analysis, so caution is needed 
when considering total adverse events in the two 
groups. There were 5 events in the quadrupling 
group and 6 in the non-quadrupling group relat-
ing to pneumonia or lower respiratory tract in-
fection in the 4 weeks after activation of zone 2 
of the self-management plan. One participant in 
the quadrupling group died of severe pneumonia. 
(For details, see the Supplementary Appendix.)
In the 14 days after zone 2 activation, 41 par-
ticipants (7%) in the quadrupling group reported 
a total of 56 nonserious adverse events, and 10 
participants (2%) in the non-quadrupling group 
reported a total of 13 nonserious adverse events. 
Oral candidiasis and dysphonia accounted for the 
great majority of nonserious adverse events, with 
36 events in the quadrupling group (19 events of 
oral candidiasis) and 9 events in the non-quadru-
pling group (7 events of oral candidiasis).
Discussion
Our trial involving adults and adolescents showed 
that a temporary quadrupling of the dose of in-
haled glucocorticoids at the time of worsening 
asthma control resulted in a lower rate of severe 
exacerbations of asthma than no increase in the 
dose (45% vs. 52%). The main strength of our 
trial is its pragmatic design and 80% recruit-
ment in primary care, giving it considerable ex-
ternal validity. Broad inclusion criteria ensured 
that the trial results are applicable to adult pa-
tients with a clinical diagnosis of asthma who 
are taking any licensed dose of inhaled gluco-
corticoids, with or without add-on medication 
and regardless of smoking status. We minimized 
trial visits after training participants to follow a 
personalized self-management plan to reflect 
follow-up in clinical practice as closely as pos-
sible, although the requirement to report zone 2 
activations is different than real-life clinical prac-
tice and may have influenced adherence to the 
assigned self-management plan. Finally, we chose 
a primary outcome that was directly relevant to 
the trial participants, and owing to the time-to-
event analysis, only 3% of the participants could 
not be included in the primary analysis.
The pragmatic design of our trial may also be 
considered to limit the implications of its find-
ings. The open-label nature of the intervention 
means that there may be a bias because the 
participants were aware, and many of the treat-
ing physicians may have been aware, of the 
person’s intervention, and this may have influ-
enced the decision by participants to seek medi-
cal help or by physicians to advise treatment 
with systemic glucocorticoids. If such an effect 
occurred, it reflects the beneficial effects likely 
to be seen in clinical practice that are missed in 
strict explanatory studies. The pragmatic nature 
of the trial also affected the quality of secondary 
outcome data such as the number of peak-flow 
measurements and quality-of-life questionnaires 
completed, but the data that were collected were 
consistent with better asthma control in the 
quadrupling group. A further potential bias was 
that more participants in the quadrupling group 
than in the non-quadrupling group attended a 
post-activation visit and, therefore, provided diary-
card data; the extent to which this affected the 
outcomes observed is unknown.
The estimated rate of severe exacerbations 
was deliberately conservative, to ensure adequate 
power, and was based on our previous studies, 
in which participants did not have to have had 
an exacerbation leading to the use of systemic 
glucocorticoids in the previous 12 months.4,9 In 
reality, the rate of severe exacerbations was much 
higher in the non-quadrupling group than we 
estimated, enabling a reduction in the number 
of participants required for the trial to detect a 
30% effect size without a loss of statistical 
power. Our finding that approximately 50% of 
the patients included in the trial had an exacer-
bation, within a year, that led to treatment with 
oral glucocorticoids or an unscheduled health 
care consultation confirms that our inclusion 
criteria identified a group of patients at high risk 
for an asthma exacerbation and is consistent 
with generally poor asthma control reported in 
many asthma surveys.10,11 It also highlights the 
pragmatic nature of our trial, because the exac-
erbation rate was much higher than that seen in 
more explanatory trials in which patient selec-
tion, a high degree of follow-up care, and a high 
rate of adherence to medication are all likely to 
reduce the background exacerbation rate.

Quadrupling Inhaled Glucocorticoid Dose
management plan based on symptoms or peak-
flow recordings improves asthma control and 
reduces the incidence of exacerbations and hospi-
tal visits as compared with no self-management 
plan.3 We and others have, however, found that 
the previous recommendation to double the dose 
of inhaled glucocorticoids when asthma control 
is deteriorating was no more effective than not 
changing the dose,4,5 and a 2016 Cochrane re-
view concluded that it is unlikely that increasing 
the dose of inhaled glucocorticoids reduces the 
odds of systemic glucocorticoid use or hospital-
ization or shortens recovery time.6 When we 
designed our trial, a 30% reduction in the inci-
dence of asthma exacerbations was thought to be 
a minimum that was clinically meaningful. Al-
though we observed a significant 19% reduction 
in the incidence of severe exacerbations, the mag-
nitude of reduction was smaller than expected.
We believe that our safety data support the 
clinical benefit of temporarily quadrupling the 
dose of inhaled glucocorticoids, because partici-
pants in the quadrupling group reported fewer 
asthma-related hospitalizations than those in the 
non-quadrupling group (3 vs. 18). However, the 
bias of the open-label aspect of the trial may 
have altered the threshold to hospitalize partici-
pants and cannot be measured.
As expected, the quadrupling group had a 
higher frequency of treatment-related adverse 
effects, such as oral candidiasis that led to treat-
ment with topical antifungal medication. We 
paid particular attention to the issue of pneumo-
nia because of reports of pneumonia associated 
with the use of inhaled glucocorticoids in asth-
ma12 and chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease,13 but there was no significant between-
group difference in the incidence of pneumonia 
in our trial. The median dose of inhaled gluco-
corticoids in our trial was 0.8 mg per day, so 
quadrupling this would be approximately equiva-
lent to 3.2 mg per day of inhaled beclometha-
sone for 7 to 14 days. Unfortunately, the sys-
temic 
effects 
of 
high-dose 
inhaled 
glucocorticoids 
are not well understood. In terms of milligrams 
of prednisolone, adrenal suppression from 1.0 mg 
per day of budesonide has been estimated to be 
as high as that from 8.7 mg of prednisolone.14 
Because we included patients receiving 1.6 mg of 
inhaled budesonide and 2 mg of inhaled flutica-
sone propionate, and if the potency ratio be-
tween inhaled glucocorticoids and prednisolone 
is linear, then the quadrupled dose in these 
participants could have had the same systemic 
effects on adrenal suppression as a course of 
prednisolone that is used to treat severe asthma 
exacerbations.
In our trial, the number of patients who 
needed to be provided with such a self-manage-
ment plan in order to prevent one severe asthma 
exacerbation was 15 (95% CI, 9 to 43). Given the 
potential benefit with respect to preventing ex-
acerbations and in view of the toxic effects of 
inhaled glucocorticoids and the biases that may 
have been introduced by the absence of blinding, 
individual practitioners, patients, and guideline 
committees will need to consider whether the 
magnitude of the reduction achieved is clinically 
meaningful.
