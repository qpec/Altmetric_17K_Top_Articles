Abstract
IMPORTANCE Unhealthful diet is a top contributor to chronic diseases in the United States. There
are growing concerns about disparities in diet among US adults, especially for those who participate
in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the largest federal food assistance
program. It remains unclear how these disparities may have changed over time.
OBJECTIVE To assess whether disparities in key food groups and nutrients according to
participation and eligibility for SNAP have persisted, improved, or worsened over time among
US adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This survey study examined a nationally representative
sample of 38 696 adults aged 20 years or older: 6162 SNAP participants, 6692 income-eligible
nonparticipants, and 25 842 higher-income individuals from 8 cycles of the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2014). Data analysis was conducted between January 1, 2017,
and December 31, 2017.
EXPOSURES Survey-weighted, energy-adjusted diet by SNAP participation status.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mean diet scores and proportions of US adults meeting poor,
intermediate, or ideal diet scores based on the American Heart Association (AHA) 2020 Strategic
Impact Goals for diet, including 8 components (fruits and vegetables; whole grains; fish and shellfish;
sugar-sweetened beverages; sodium; nuts, seeds, and legumes; processed meats; and saturated fat).
RESULTS The survey included 38 696 respondents (20 062 female [51.9%]; 18 386 non-Hispanic
white [69.8%]; mean [SD] age, 46.8 [14.8] years). Participants of SNAP were younger (mean [SD]
age, 41.4 [15.6] years) than income-eligible nonparticipants (mean [SD] age, 44.9 [19.6] years) or
higher-income individuals (mean [SD] age, 47.8 [13.6] years); more likely to be female (3552 of 6162
[58.6%] vs 3504 of 6692 [54.8%] and 13 006 of 25 842 [50.4%], respectively); and less likely to be
non-Hispanic white (2062 of 6162 [48.2%] vs 2594 of 6692 [56.0%] and 13 712 of 25 842 [75.8%],
respectively). From surveys conducted in 2003 and 2004 to those conducted in 2013 and 2014,
SNAP participants had less improvement in AHA diet scores than both income-eligible
nonparticipants and higher-income individuals (change in mean score = 0.57 [95% CI, −2.18 to 0.33]
vs 2.56 [95% CI, 0.36-4.76] and 3.84 [95% CI, 2.39-5.29], respectively; P = .04 for interaction).
Disparities persisted for most foods and nutrients and worsened for processed meats, added sugars,
and nuts and seeds. In 2013 to 2014, a higher proportion of SNAP participants had poor diet scores
compared with income-eligible nonparticipants and higher-income individuals (461 of 950 [53.5%]
vs 247 of 690 [38.0%] and 773 of 2797 [28.7%]; P < .001 for difference), and a lower proportion had
intermediate diet scores (477 of 950 [45.3%] vs 428 of 690 [59.8%] and 1933 of 2797 [68.7%];

Key Points
Question Have disparities in diet
quality of US adults according to
participation and eligibility for food
assistance persisted, improved, or
worsened over the past 15 years?
Findings This survey study found that
despite an overall improvement in diet
quality among US adults between 1999
and 2014, disparities persisted or
worsened for most dietary components
when comparing participants of the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program (SNAP) with income-eligible
nonparticipants and higher-income
individuals. For nearly all dietary
components, SNAP participants do not
meet recommendations for a
healthful diet.
Meaning Evidence-based nutrition
policies are needed to reduce diet-
related health disparities in the
United States.

P < .001 for difference). The proportion of participants with ideal diet scores was low in all 3 groups
(12 of 950 [1.3%] vs 15 of 690 [2.2%] and 91 of 2797 [2.6%]; P = .26 for difference).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Dietary disparities persisted or worsened for most dietary
components among US adults. Despite improvement in some dietary components, SNAP
participants still do not meet the AHA goals for a healthful diet.

Introduction
Unhealthful diet is one of the top contributors to poor health in the United States,1 and disparities in
diet quality by socioeconomic status can contribute to the nation’
s health disparities. While overall
diet quality has modestly improved in the past decade,2 there are growing concerns that
socioeconomic disparities persist in diet quality of US adults. Low-income individuals have not
experienced the same improvements in diet quality as high-income individuals,2,3 and for
consumption of several foods, this disparity may have widened over time.3
Among different dietary programs for low-income households, the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (SNAP) is by far the largest and most important safety net program, providing
monthly benefits to approximately 1 in 7 US individuals and representing more than half of the annual
budget of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).4,5 Participants in SNAP experience significantly
higher all-cause, cardiovascular, and diabetes mortality compared with other American adults.6-8
Prior studies have shown that disparities exist in diet quality between SNAP participants and higher-
income individuals.9 However, potential trends in these dietary disparities over time remain unclear.
We assessed whether disparities for overall diet quality and for key foods and nutrients
persisted, improved, or worsened over time among adult SNAP participants from 1999 to 2014
compared with both SNAP-eligible nonparticipants and higher-income American adults.
Methods
Study Design and Population
We used data from US adults aged 20 years or older completing at least 1 valid 24-hour diet recall, as
determined by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), during 8 cycles of the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 through 2014. The response rates of
the NHANES ranged from 71% to 85% over the study period.10 We used NHANES sampling weights
in all analyses, which account for the complex survey design (eg, oversampling of minorities), survey
nonresponse, poststratification, and whether 1 or 2 days of diet recalls were completed.11 During the
study period, 89.0% (38 979 of 43 793) of the NHANES respondents aged 20 years or older
provided a single valid diet recall, among whom 69.9% (27 258 of 38 979) also provided a second
valid recall. The dietary sampling weights additionally account for the dietary interview–specific
nonresponse and day of the week for dietary intake interviews.11 All analyses incorporated these
survey weights and provided nationally representative estimates of dietary intake. Data analyses
were conducted between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017. The NCHS Research Ethics Review
Board approved NHANES, and all participants provided written informed consent. The Tufts
University institutional review board exempted the study from review and waived requirements for
patient informed consent.
SNAP Participation
Individuals were classified as SNAP participants based on reported household participation in SNAP
at any point during the past 12 months. Individuals were classified as income-eligible nonparticipants

 if they did not participate but had a monthly family gross income of less than or equal to 130% of the
poverty guideline (ie, family income to poverty ratio �1.30, the major eligibility criterion for SNAP),
and as higher-income individuals if they had a family income to poverty ratio greater than 1.30.12
American Heart Association Diet Score
As a summary indicator of a healthful diet, a diet score was constructed based on the American Heart
Association (AHA) 2020 Strategic Impact Goals for diet,1 which have been validated as
independently associated with cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes in multiple populations.13 The
8 dietary components were fruits and vegetables; fish and shellfish; whole grains; sugar-sweetened
beverages (SSBs); sodium; nuts, seeds, and legumes; processed meat; and saturated fat. As
previously detailed,2 a continuous score (ie, AHA total score) was constructed by summing all 8
components. Based on the AHA 2020 goals for diet, the proportions of US adults with a poor diet
(score <32.0, corresponding to <40.0% adherence to the AHA 2020 goals), an intermediate diet
(score = 32.0-63.9, corresponding to 40.0%-79.9% adherence), or an ideal diet (score �64.0,
corresponding to �80.0% adherence) were estimated.
Food Groups and Nutrients
In addition to the 8 AHA dietary components, we evaluated individual food groups and nutrients
linked to major health outcomes as well as those of current interest to policy makers or the general
public. The USDA Food Patterns Equivalents Database and MyPyramid Equivalents Database, which
disaggregate mixed foods into their component parts, were harmonized and used to assess trends
in consumption of major food groups.2 Food groups (eg, vegetables) were further disaggregated into
subgroups (eg, dark green vegetables vs white potatoes) to evaluate trends by subtype. Nutrients
were estimated based on cycle-specific versions of the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary
Studies. Intake of all food groups and nutrients was energy adjusted using the residual method to
evaluate trends independent of changes in total energy intake, which could relate to nondietary
changes such as physical activity, and to minimize measurement error in dietary estimates.
Statistical Analysis
We estimated the nationally representative population mean intake for key food groups and
nutrients for each NHANES cycle among SNAP participants, income-eligible nonparticipants, and
higher-income individuals, incorporating the weights from the complex NHANES sample design to
account for different sampling probabilities and participation rates. To assess overall diet quality, we
calculated AHA diet scores and estimated the proportion of participants meeting criteria for poor,
intermediate, and ideal diets. Because such binary estimates are not based on stratum means but on
distributions of dietary intake above or below a certain threshold, which are not comparable between
single and multiple diet recalls, we restricted all analyses on proportions and corresponding AHA diet
scores to participants with 2 nonconsecutive diet recalls (2003 onward).
We assessed the trends in dietary intake and AHA diet scores by treating the 2-year survey cycle
as a continuous variable in survey-weighted linear regression models. We also evaluated changes in
dietary intake by computing the difference in mean intake between the earliest (1999-2000) and
latest (2013-2014) cycles. To assess whether dietary disparities persisted, improved, or worsened
over time, we used a survey-weighted Wald test for an interaction term between 2-year survey cycle
and SNAP participation status and for an interaction term between change in mean intake and SNAP
participation status. To determine the degree to which the observed dietary disparity trends were
driven by demographic shifts, we performed sensitivity analyses adjusting for trends in demographic
variables (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and income).
All statistical analyses were 2-sided and significance was considered at an α level of .05. Stata
statistical software version 14 (StataCorp) was used for all analysis. We followed the American
Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) reporting guideline for this study.

 Results
The survey included 38 696 respondents (20 062 female [51.9%]; 18 386 non-Hispanic white
[69.8%]; mean [SD] age, 46.8 [14.8] years). Survey-weighted characteristics of SNAP participants,
income-eligible nonparticipants, and higher-income individuals are presented in Table 1,
representing the characteristics of approximately 25.5 million adult SNAP participants, 26.9 million
income-eligible nonparticipants, and 158.7 million higher-income US adults. Participants of SNAP
were younger (mean [SD] age, 41.4 [15.6] years) than income-eligible nonparticipants (mean [SD]
age, 44.9 [19.6] years) or higher-income individuals (mean [SD] age, 47.8 [13.6] years); more likely to
be female (3552 of 6162 [58.6%] vs 3504 of 6692 [54.8%] and 13 006 of 25 842 [50.4%],
respectively); and less likely to be non-Hispanic white (2062 of 6162 [48.2%] vs 2594 of 6692
[56.0%] and 13 712 of 25 842 [75.8%], respectively). Trends in SNAP participation and accompanying
demographic shifts are shown in eTable 1 in the Supplement. From 2003 to 2014, the mean AHA diet
score (maximum of 80) among SNAP participants did not significantly change (from 31.5 [95% CI,
29.2-33.8] to 32.1 [95% CI, 30.6-33.6]; P = .11 for trend), whereas the mean AHA diet score
significantly improved in both income-eligible nonparticipants (from 34.2 [95% CI, 32.6-35.9] to 36.8
[95% CI, 35.3-38.3]; P = .004 for trend) and higher-income individuals (from 35.8 [95% CI, 34.6-
36.9] to 39.6 [95% CI, 38.7-40.5]; P < .001 for trend) (Table 2). The mean change in AHA diet score
was 0.57 (95% CI, −2.18 to 0.33) among SNAP participants, 2.56 (95% CI, 0.36-4.76) among income-
eligible nonparticipants, and 3.84 (95% CI, 2.39-5.29) among higher-income individuals (P = .04 for
interaction).

a Weighted sample size was estimated using National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dietary
weights that account for the complex survey design
(including oversampling), survey nonresponse, and
poststratification. The weighted sample size
represents US adults who are SNAP participants,
income-eligible nonparticipants, and higher-income
individuals.
b Family income to poverty ratio represents the ratio
of family income to the federal poverty threshold,
adjusting for household size. For reference, the
federal threshold in 2014 for a family of 4 was
$23 850 per year. A family of 4 earning $44 123 per
year would have a ratio of 1.85. A lower ratio
indicates a lower level of income.

a All dietary variables were adjusted for energy to 2000 kcal/d using the residual method prior to analysis. Each
AHA dietary component was evaluated based on a continuous scoring system. Intake of each dietary component
was scored from 0 to 10 (beneficial components) or from 10 to 0 (harmful components). For beneficial
components, individuals with zero intake received the lowest score (0). For harmful components, the lowest
score (0) was assigned to a higher level, approximately equivalent to the 80th to 90th percentile of intake
among US adults, and rounded to practical values (eg, 4500 mg/d of sodium, one 50-g serving per day of
processed meat, two 8-oz servings per day of sugar-sweetened beverages, and 15% energy from saturated fat).
Intermediate dietary intake was scored linearly between 0 and 10. For example, an adult consuming 3000 mg/d
of sodium would receive 5 sodium points (ie, his or her sodium consumption was halfway between 1500 mg/d
and the maximum value of 4500 mg/d).
b The total AHA diet score is the sum of the scores for 8 dietary components (fruits and vegetables; whole grains;
fish and shellfish; sugar-sweetened beverages; sodium; nuts, seeds, and legumes; processed meat; and
saturated fat).
c P value for interaction for potential heterogeneous trends in diet scores by SNAP participation status.
d P value for interaction for potential heterogeneous changes in diet scores from 2003 to 2014 by SNAP
participation status.
e According to the AHA 2020 goals, up to 3 cups per week (0.42 cups per day) of starchy vegetables (eg, potatoes,
peas, corn) could be included; this maximum was incorporated into the analysis, with higher intake not
contributing toward the score. Consumption of 100% fruit juice could also be included; however, its contribution
was not capped in the original AHA 2020 goals and does not contribute to the score.

 Among higher-income individuals, the proportion with an ideal diet score increased from 1.4%
(95% CI, 0.8%-2.3%) to 2.6% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.4%) (P = .01 for trend) and the proportion with an
intermediate diet score increased from 59.1% (95% CI, 55.4%-62.7%) to 68.7% (95% CI,
66.3%-71.0%) (P< .001 for trend), while the proportion with a poor diet score decreased from 39.5%
(95% CI, 35.9%-43.3%) to 28.7% (95% CI, 26.4%-31.1%) (P< .001 for trend) (Table 3 and Figure). In
contrast, no significant changes in the proportions having ideal, intermediate, and poor diet scores
were detected among SNAP participants and income-eligible nonparticipants. The change in
proportions with a poor diet score were −0.5% (95% CI, −12.4% to 11.4%) among SNAP participants,
−4.9% (95% CI, −11.6% to 1.9%) among income-eligible nonparticipants, and −10.8% (95% CI,
−15.2% to −6.5%) among higher-income individuals (P = .06 for interaction). The corresponding
changes in proportions with an intermediate diet score were −0.4% (95% CI, −12.2% to 11.3%) among
SNAP participants, 3.5% (95% CI, −3.3% to 10.3%) among income-eligible nonparticipants, and 9.6%
(95% CI, 5.3%-13.9%) among higher-income individuals (P = .05 for interaction). The corresponding
changes in proportions with an ideal diet score were 0.9% (95% CI, −0.4% to 2.3%) among SNAP
participants, 1.4% (95% CI, −0.4% to 3.2%) among income-eligible nonparticipants, and 1.2% (95%
CI, 0.3%-2.2%) among higher-income individuals (P = .61 for interaction).
Among the 8 AHA dietary components, disparities worsened for processed meat among SNAP
participants. The mean change in processed meat score was −0.94 (95% CI, −1.55 to −0.34),
corresponding to a reduced proportion of individuals meeting the recommended intake over time,
compared with no change in processed meat score among income-eligible nonparticipants (−0.25;
95% CI, −0.91 to 0.42) and higher-income individuals (0.20; 95% CI, −0.12 to 0.52) (P = .001 for
interaction) (Table 2). Among other key food groups, dietary disparities also worsened for nuts and
seeds, fish and shellfish, and added sugars. For example, SNAP participants experienced the smallest
reductions in added sugars (mean change, −4.0 servings per day; 95% CI, −7.3 to −0.7 servings per
day) compared with income-eligible nonparticipants (−7.6 servings per day; 95% CI, −10.4 to −4.9
servings per day) and higher-income individuals (−6.0 servings per day; 95% CI, −7.3 to −4.7 servings
per day) (P = .05 for interaction). Increasing trends of nut and seed and fish and shellfish
consumption were apparent among income-eligible nonparticipants and higher-income individuals
but not among SNAP participants (eTable 2 and eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Consistent differences
for sodium intake were not evident. Disparities appeared to improve for certain nutrients, such as
saturated fat, cholesterol, and polyunsaturated fat, but persisted for most food groups and nutrients
(eTable 2 and eFigures 1 and 2 in the Supplement). After adjusting for differences in age, sex, race/
ethnicity, education, and income over time, diet-related disparities by SNAP participation status were
not materially altered for most dietary components (eTables 3, 4, 5, and 6 in the Supplement).
Despite some improvement in diet quality by 2014, SNAP participants still had lower diet quality
than income-eligible nonparticipants and higher-income individuals. In 2014, mean (SD) AHA diet
scores were 32.1 (11.7) among SNAP participants, 36.8 (12.3) among income-eligible nonparticipants,
and 39.6 (10.4) among higher-income individuals (P < .001 for difference) (Table 2). Similarly, SNAP
participants had a significantly higher proportion with a poor diet score than income-eligible
nonparticipants and higher-income individuals (461 of 950 [53.5%] vs 247 of 690 [38.0%] and 773
of 2797 [28.7%]; P < .001 for difference) and a significantly lower proportion with an intermediate
diet score (477 of 950 [45.3%] vs 428 of 690 [59.8%] and 1933 of 2797 [68.7%]; P < .001 for
difference). The proportion of participants with an ideal diet score was low in all 3 groups (12 of 950
[1.3%] vs 15 of 690 [2.2%] and 91 of 2797 [2.6%]; P = .26 for difference) (Table 3). In terms of AHA
diet components, SNAP participants had the lowest consumption of fruits and vegetables; whole
grains; fish and shellfish; and nuts, seeds, and legumes and the highest consumption of SSBs,
although SNAP participants also had the lowest sodium consumption (Table 4).
Similar trends in diet quality were found between SNAP participants with higher vs lower levels
of income: neither group had improved AHA diet scores over time. After adjusting for differences in
age, sex, and race/ethnicity over time, the mean change in total AHA diet score from 2003 to 2014
was 0.32 (95% CI, −1.95 to 2.58; P = .36 for trend) among lower-income SNAP participants (family

income SNAP participants (family income to poverty ratio >1.30). In contrast, both income-eligible
nonparticipants and higher-income individuals had significant improvements in diet quality score
over time. The adjusted mean change in total AHA diet score was 2.16 (95% CI, 0.01-4.30; P = .008
for trend) and 3.33 (95% CI, 1.86-4.80; P < .001 for trend), respectively (P = .02 for interaction)
(eTable 7 in the Supplement). Further adjustment for education did not alter results. Dietary trends
were also similar among subgroups of SNAP participants by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education
(eTables 8, 9, 10, and 11 in the Supplement).
Discussion
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program served 42.1 million people in fiscal year 2017, with an
annual budget of $70 billion, exceeding the budgets of the National Institutes of Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, US Food and Drug Administration, Health Resources and Services
Administration, and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality combined. While SNAP provides
essential financial assistance to alleviate hunger and food insecurity in low-income families,14 less
emphasis has been given to improving diet quality and healthfulness. To our knowledge, the time
trends in diet disparities of multiple food groups and nutrients associated with chronic diseases have

Trends and Disparities in Diet Quality Among US Adults, 1999-2014

 not been previously evaluated by SNAP participation status. Our results demonstrate that from 1999
to 2014, overall diet quality of SNAP participants did not significantly improve, in contrast to
improvements among both income-eligible nonparticipants and higher-income individuals.
Consistent with this, disparities in most individual dietary components persisted or worsened
over time.
Some improvements were seen in individual dietary components among SNAP participants.
These included increased whole grains, whole fruits, and dark green vegetables and decreased SSBs.
These encouraging trends could be attributable to public health policies and nutrition education that
influence all consumers, including SNAP participants, such as the 5 A Day national campaign,15
increasing public support for tax initiatives on SSBs,16 and new federal dietary recommendations on
whole grains in 2000 and 2005.17 Advocacy groups such as the AHA have also launched nutrition
campaigns,18 while the food industry has increased the number of whole-grain products 20-fold over
10 years.19
Despite these positive trends, we found that SNAP participants experienced the smallest
improvements in these food categories and also experienced increasing disparities in processed
meats, added sugars, nuts and seeds, and fish and shellfish. Our findings highlight the need to
investigate and address the reasons for these worsening disparities. For example, access to healthful
foods and beverages by low-income families participating in SNAP may remain limited.20 Our
findings should not be interpreted as a causal effect of participating in SNAP, however. It is possible
that dietary trends in this group could have been even worse without participation in SNAP.
Nevertheless, our findings underscore the need for robust new strategies to improve diet quality and
reduce dietary disparities in the United States.
Nutrition knowledge, often associated with education and income, may partly mediate
disparities in dietary intake.21-23 The USDA SNAP-Ed program provides grants to states for nutrition
education and obesity prevention for SNAP participants and other income-eligible individuals, yet
represents only about 0.5% of the overall SNAP budget, or about $10 per participant per year. This
program could be expanded to address diet-related disparities through not only education but also
policy and system interventions that would be rigorously evaluated for effectiveness.
Given higher costs of healthier food,24 bipartisan panels have recommended economic
incentives for healthier eating among SNAP participants.25,26 For example, the Healthy Incentives
Pilot randomized trial demonstrated a 26% increase in fruit and vegetable consumption among SNAP
participants receiving a 30% subsidy on such purchases.27 However, expansion of such programs
remains limited, with only about $15 million per year (about $0.36 per participant per year) invested
in this program over the last 2 years.28 A recent modeling analysis suggested that a 30% subsidy for
purchases of fruits and vegetables provided to all SNAP participants could reduce cardiovascular
disease disparities between SNAP participants and SNAP-ineligible individuals by
approximately 8%.29
Revisions of food items eligible for SNAP purchases have also been recommended.25,26 A
related federal nutrition assistance program, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), has been revised to limit eligibility of unhealthy foods and
encourage consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains through various measures, including
vouchers.30 These revisions significantly improved the diet quality of children participating
in WIC.31-33
We found that SNAP participants consumed more SSBs than other US adults, a finding
consistent with prior reports34 and purchasing data.35 About three-quarters of SSB grocery
purchases by SNAP participants are paid for with SNAP dollars (with the rest paid for with
participants’other food dollars),36 representing 9% of all SNAP spending37 ($6 billion per year38) or
about 36 million 8-oz servings per day of SSBs purchased by SNAP.39 While removing SSBs from
SNAP eligibility is controversial because of concerns about government paternalism and industry
opposition,40,41 most SNAP participants support removing SSBs from eligible purchases if paired
with incentives for healthful foods.42 As an alternative strategy, partial disincentives on purchases of

 unhealthful items, rather than complete restrictions, would preserve choice and also provide direct
cost savings to SNAP that could be leveraged for subsidizing healthful foods.
Our investigation has several strengths. Eight cycles of nationally representative data provided
the most up-to-date evaluation of recent trends. We assessed diet quality scores, proportions
meeting cut points, and intakes of key food groups and nutrients, providing a comprehensive portrait
of diet quality of US adults by SNAP status.
Limitations
Potential limitations should also be considered. Self-reported dietary intake is subject to
measurement error. However, NHANES incorporated 1 or 2 standardized 24-hour diet recalls per
person that were energy adjusted and averaged whenever possible to reduce measurement
error.43-45 Although one or two 24-hour diet recalls per individual may inaccurately estimate habitual
long-term intake for a specific individual, this method is excellent for estimating the mean intake of
a group or population stratum,43 the unit in our analyses. Benefit levels in SNAP can differ between
participants and over time, producing partial misclassification of SNAP participation and reducing
our ability to detect full differences. There could also be misreporting of SNAP participation, although
the proportion of misreporting appeared to be a small fraction.46 The SNAP participation rates
reported by NHANES respondents were consistent with the participation rates assessed based on
the administrative records of the USDA.47-49 Because the consequence of such measurement error is
to bias the results toward the null, our findings may underestimate certain disparities by SNAP status.
Lastly, the proportion of SNAP participants among US adults increased from 9% in 1999 to 17% in
2014, which could reflect both changes in economic factors (ie, the Great Recession) and, to a lesser
extent, changes in SNAP policies, such as the 2002 and 2008 Farm Acts that improved accessibility
and expanded eligibility.50 These economic and policy changes moved individuals with greater
education and higher income onto SNAP. Such shifts would most likely make the observed dietary
disparities smaller, because such individuals would generally have better diet quality than SNAP
participants with lower education. The observed dietary disparities among US adults could be
even larger.
Conclusions
Despite an overall improvement in diet quality among all US adults aged 20 years or older between
1999 and 2014, the overall diet quality of SNAP participants remained unchanged, and disparities
persisted or worsened for most dietary components compared with income-eligible nonparticipants
and higher-income individuals. Our findings highlight the need for evidence-based nutrition policies
to help close these gaps and reduce diet-related health disparities in the United States.
