Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been used to enhance endurance per-
formance but its precise mechanisms and effects remain unknown.
Objective: To investigate the effect of bilateral tDCS on neuromuscular function and performance during
a cycling time to task failure (TTF) test.
Methods: Twelve participants in randomized order received a placebo tDCS (SHAM) or real tDCS with
two cathodes (CATHODAL) or two anodes (ANODAL) over bilateral motor cortices and the opposite
electrode pair over the ipsilateral shoulders. Each session lasted 10 min and current was set at 2 mA.
Neuromuscular assessment was performed before and after tDCS and was followed by a cycling time to
task failure (TTF) test. Heart rate (HR), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), leg muscle pain (PAIN) and
blood lactate accumulation (DB[La�]) in response to the cycling TTF test were measured.
Results: Corticospinal excitability increased in the ANODAL condition (P < 0.001) while none of the other
neuromuscular parameters showed any change. Neuromuscular parameters did not change in the SHAM
and CATHODAL conditions. TTF was significantly longer in the ANODAL (P ¼ 0.003) compared to
CATHODAL and SHAM conditions (12.61 ± 4.65 min; 10.61 ± 4.34 min; 10.21 ± 3.47 min respectively),
with significantly lower RPE and higher DB[La�] (P < 0.001). No differences between conditions were
found for HR (P ¼ 0.803) and PAIN during the cycling TTF test (P ¼ 0.305).
Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that tDCS with the anode over both motor cortices using a
bilateral extracephalic reference improves endurance performance.

Introduction
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive
brain stimulation technique that delivers a constant, weak elec-
trical current flow to the brain by placing two or more electrodes
over the scalp [1]. The neuromodulatory effect of tDCS is polarity
specific with an excitatory effect under the anodal electrode and an
inhibitory effect under the cathodal electrode [1]. When applied to
the primary motor cortex (M1), cortical excitability has been shown
to increase after anodal stimulation and to be reduced after
cathodal stimulation [2], as demonstrated by changes in the motor
evoked potential (MEP) elicited via transcranial magnetic stimu-
lation (TMS). This neuromodulatory effect is probably achieved by a
shift of the resting membrane potential of the targeted neural cells
[1]. tDCS has been widely used in cognitive neuroscience to un-
derstand brain function [3,4], and in the treatment of various
neurological disorders [5], and psychiatric disorders [6].
More recently, there has been great interest in the use of tDCS to
enhance sport performance [7,8], and to facilitate neuroplasticity
and training adaptations [9]. With specific reference to the
enhancement of endurance performance, the acute administration
of anodal stimulation over the contralateral primary motor cortex
(M1) prior to or during isometric time to task failure (TTF) tests of
isolated muscle groups has induced either an improvement
[10e13], or no effect [14,15]. A similar inconsistency in endurance

 performance outcomes has been also reported in cycling studies
[16e19]. The inconsistent effects of tDCS on endurance perfor-
mance found in previous experimental studies might be partly
caused by the different electrode montages adopted [20]. For
example, Angius et al. [21], did not find any improvement in TTF
during cycling exercise when anodal tDCS was delivered over M1
with the cathode over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [21].
Such a cephalic montage may induce effects under the cathode [11]
that may modulate or even nullify the effect of the anode over M1.
In a follow-up study, Angius et al. [11] compared cephalic and
extracephalic tDCS montages by targeting M1 with the anodal
electrode and they found that isometric TTF of the knee extensor
muscles was significantly longer when the extracephalic montage
was used. Therefore, it seems that an extracephalic montage may
be preferable when tDCS is applied to enhance endurance perfor-
mance. Furthermore, various studies have demonstrated the effi-
cacy and safety of extracephalic montages [11,22] and monopolar
montages [23] in other experimental and clinical settings [24].
The primary aim of the present study was to verify that the
positive effect of an anodal electrode over M1 with an extracephalic
montage on endurance performance during an isometric TTF test
with the knee extensor muscles can be replicated in an exercise
mode (cycling) more relevant to real endurance competitions,
involving continuous, dynamic, whole-body exercise lasting more
than 75 s [25]. As cycling exercise involves both lower limbs, the
extracephalic montage proposed by Angius et al. [11], might be
more targeted than the unilateral one used in a previous cycling
study [21]. Overall, this montage simultaneously stimulates both
primary motor cortices while also potentially avoiding the effects of
the cathode over other brain areas. The secondary aim of the study
was to investigate some of the potential physiological and psy-
chological mechanisms for the hypothesised positive effect on
endurance performance. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that
an extracephalic bilateral tDCS montage with anodal electrodes
over M1 and cathodes placed over the shoulders increases corti-
cospinal excitability during submaximal contractions of the knee
extensor muscles and reduces perception of effort during cycling
exercise. Therefore, because the neural signals processed by the
brain to generate perception of effort seem to be corollary dis-
charges from SMA and other cortical areas upstream of M1
[26e29], an increase in corticospinal excitability should lead to a
lower perception of effort during cycling exercise at the same po-
wer output.
Methods
Participants
Twelve recreationally active participants (4 women and 8 men;
mean ± SD, age: 24 ± 5 yr, height: 175 ± 12 cm, weight: 74 ± 17 kg)
volunteered for this study. Eligibility criteria were age between 18
and 44 yr old and performing regular aerobic training (at least 3 h
per week). Participants were not included in the study if they had
any somatic or mental disorder or were taking any medication at
the time of the study. Prior to providing written informed consent,
all participants were given instructions about the experimental
procedures. Approval for the experiment was obtained from the
local
Research
Ethics
Committee
(approval
number:
Prop
98_2014_2015), in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
After completion of all their experimental visits, participants were
fully debriefed on the actual study aims, and provided with their
individual results. To minimize the subject-expectancy effect, par-
ticipants were told that the aim of the experiment was to study the
effect of tDCS on the cardiovascular response during exhaustive
exercise. After debriefing, participants were asked not to discuss
the real purpose of the study purpose with any other participants
until the entire data collection had been completed.
Experimental protocol
Participants visited the laboratory on four different occasions
that included one preliminary visit and three experimental visits.
During the three experimental visits, participants were randomly
assigned in a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced order to a
sham (SHAM), anodal (ANODAL) and cathodal (CATHODAL) stim-
ulation conditions (see Transcranial direct current stimulation pro-
cedures for more details). Participants were given instructions to
avoid caffeine, alcohol, stimulants or depressants, and strenuous
exercise for 48 h prior to each visit. All experimental visits were
completed within 14 days and were interspaced by at least 48 h.
Each visit was performed at the same time of the day in a
temperature-controlled room (20 �C, relative humidity between 40
and 50%).
During the first visit participants were familiarized with the
laboratory equipment and all the experimental procedures. In
addition, they performed an incremental cycling test on a cycle
ergometer (Excalibur Spot, Lode, Groningen, Netherlands) to
establish individual peak power output (Wpeak). In this test, par-
ticipants performed a 5 min warm up at 100 W, followed by an
incremental protocol in which the power increased by 5 W every
15 s�1 until task failure (i.e. operationally defined as a pedal fre-
quency of less than 60 revolutions/min (RPM) for more than 5 s
despite strong verbal encouragement). The cycle ergometer rider
position was recorded for each participant so that it could be
reproduced for all the following visits.
In visits 2e4, participants performed a neuromuscular assess-
ment before (pre) and after (post) tDCS administration (see
Neuromuscular assessment for more details), as well as a time to task
failure (TTF) test (see Time to task failure test for more details). A
schematic summary of all procedures performed and timing during
each experimental visit is illustrated in Fig. 1, panel B.
Transcranial direct current stimulation procedures
For the present experiment, an extracephalic tDCS montage
similar to the one used by Angius et al. [11] was adopted. For the
ANODAL condition both anodal electrodes were placed over bilat-
eral M1 (C3 and C4 according to the 10e20 EEG system) in corre-
spondence with the TMS stimulation point, while the cathodal
electrodes were placed respectively above the ipsilateral shoulders
(see Fig. 1, panel A). For the CATHODAL condition, the position of
the electrodes was simply reversed with respect to the ANODAL
condition (see Fig. 1, panel B). For the SHAM condition, the same set
up of ANODAL condition was used. tDCS was administered by two
direct current stimulators (TCT Research Limited, Hong Kong) using
two rubber target electrodes (size: 7 � 5 cm) and two rubber return
electrodes (size 5 � 5 cm) and water-soaked synthetic sponge.
Stimulation intensity was set at 2.0 mA for 10 min, whereas during
the SHAM condition lasted only 30 s. For all three conditions, the
current was ramped up and down for 10 s. To ensure good
conductance, electrode sponges were soaked with standard saline
solution (NaCl 9%) and elasticated straps were used to maintain all
the electrodes on the scalp and both shoulders. The electrical
resistance was constantly monitored on the stimulator's display
within a range between 4 and 5 kU.
Neuromuscular assessment
After a standardised warm up consisting of 10 brief (5 s) sub-
maximal voluntary isometric contractions at 50% of the estimated
L. Angius et al. / Brain Stimulation 11 (2018) 108e117
109
 MVC torque, the neuromuscular assessment was performed before
and after tDCS stimulation (see Fig. 1). All participants performed a
5 s isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the right
knee extensor muscles with superimposed doublet followed (3 s
post MVC) by a resting potentiated doublet (Doublet). Ten seconds
after the MVC, participants were asked to perform four brief sub-
maximal isometric contractions (3 s) at 10% of MVC with super-
imposed TMS, followed by one submaximal contraction (3 s) at 10%
of MVC with superimposed nerve stimulation. Each contraction
was interspaced by 3 s. Submaximal muscle contraction has been
shown to provide a facilitation of the corticospinal tract, thus
requiring less than 100% of the maximum stimulator output to elicit
the minimum measurable MEP response of the targeted muscle
[30,31] and also reduces the unpleasantness caused by the high
stimulator intensity for the participants.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
Excitability of the left M1 was measured by means of TMS.
Stimulation was delivered with a 110 mm diameter concave coil
over the left M1 by a magnetic stimulator (Magstim 2002, The
Magstim Company Ltd, Whitland, UK). The precise site of the
stimulation was determined at the beginning of each visit and then
marked on the scalp to maintain the same coil position during the
visit. The coil position was determined in order to elicit the largest
MEP response of the right vastus lateralis (VL) and a small MEP
response (<10% of right VL MEP amplitude) in the antagonist
muscle (biceps femoris, BF). After determination of the exact coil
position, the stimulus intensity was set to elicit the largest MEP
response during a brief (3 s) submaximal isometric contraction at
the 10% of MVC of the knee extensor muscles. The stimulation in-
tensity was determined during each experimental visit before
commencing with the neuromuscular assessment. The mean
stimulation intensity was 65 ± 4% of the maximum stimulator
output.
Femoral nerve stimulation
Transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the right femoral nerve
was delivered by a high-voltage constant-current stimulator
(model DS7 modified, Digitimer, Hertfordshire, UK). The femoral
nerve was stimulated by a cathode electrode (2 � 2 cm, Swaromed,
Nessler Medizintechnik, Innsbruck, Austria) positioned over the
right femoral triangle with the anodal electrode (10 � 5 cm;
Phoenix Healthcare Products Ltd., Nottingham, UK) placed in the
right gluteal fold. Stimulation intensity was increased by 20 mA
until the electrical compound action potential response (M-wave)
did not further increase both at rest and during a submaximal 10%
MVC contraction. The stimulation intensity was determined during
each experimental visit before commencing the neuromuscular
assessment. The optimal intensity of stimulation (Mmax) was then
set at 130% of the intensity required to elicit the highest M-wave.
The stimulus duration was 200 ms, with an interval between stimuli
in the doublet of 10 ms (100 Hz frequency). The mean stimulation
intensity was 290 ± 71 mA.
Mechanical recordings
The neuromuscular assessment was performed on an isokinetic
dynamometer (Cybex NORM, CMSi, Computer Sports Medicine Inc.,
Stoughton, USA). All participants performed the neuromuscular
assessment in isometric conditions with the right leg at a knee
flexion of 90� (0� ¼ full extension) and a hip angle of 90�.
The dynamometer set-up was recorded and kept constant over
all visits for each participant to maintain the same position. Me-
chanical signals were recorded at a sampling frequency of 1 kHz
and analysed with commercially available software (Acqknowledge
4.2 for MP Systems, Biopac Systems Inc., Goleta, USA).

 Electromyographic recordings
Surface electromyography (EMG) of the VL and BF were acquired
with two square surface electrodes (Swaromed, Nessler Medi-
zintechnik, Innsbruck, Austria). The recording site was circular
(10 mm diameter) in the center of the electrode (center-to-center
distance of 20 mm). Electrodes were placed according to the
SENIAM guidelines [32]. More specifically electrodes for VL were
placed on the muscle belly at 2/3 of the line from the anterior spina
iliaca superior and the lateral side of the patella while for the BF
electrodes were placed on the muscle belly at 50% on the line be-
tween the ischial tuberosity and the lateral epicondyle of the tibia
with the reference electrode placed over the patella. Before starting
the neuromuscular assessment, the skin was shaved and cleaned
with alcohol swabs. The electrical signal was then amplified with a
bandwidth frequency ranging from 10 Hz to 500 Hz (gain ¼ 500)
with commercially available software (Acqknowledge 4.2 for MP
Systems, Biopac Systems Inc., Goleta, USA).
Cycling time to task failure test
After the final neuromuscular assessment, participants per-
formed the TTF test on the cycle ergometer at 70% of their Wpeak.
The cycling TTF test terminated when the participants were not
able to maintain a pedal frequency above 60 revolution/min for
more than 5 s despite strong verbal encouragement. The cycling
TTF test was preceded by a 5 min warm up at 100 W. Participants
were verbally encouraged throughout the cycling TTF test by a
researcher blinded to the condition allocation.
Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and leg muscle pain (PAIN)
were measured respectively using the 15-point RPE scale [33] and a
10-point numerical scale for PAIN [34] administered 30 s after the
start of the cycling TTF test, at the end of each min, and at task
failure. Heart rate (HR) was continuously monitored using a HR
monitor (Polar RS400; Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland) and
averaged to provide data points to coincide with RPE and PAIN
ratings. Blood lactate concentration (B[La�]) was measured at rest
before the first neuromuscular assessment (baseline) and imme-
diately after the cycling TTF test (at task failure). The difference
between B[La�] at task failure and B[La�] at rest was used to obtain
blood lactate accumulation (DB[La�]). A 10 ml sample of capillary
blood was collected from the thumb of the right hand and imme-
diately analysed for B[La�] (Biosen; EFK Diagnostics, London, UK).
Data analysis
Peak torque obtained during the MVC was used as a measure of
the force-generating capacity of the knee extensor muscles.
Voluntary activation level (VAL) during the MVC was obtained ac-
cording to the following formula:
VAL ¼ 100 � ð1
� superimposed doublet amplitude=potentiated doubletÞ
The EMG amplitude obtained during the MVC was quantified
with the root mean square (RMS) for a 0.5 s interval during the peak
torque (250 ms either side at the peak torque). The RMS of EMG was
automatically calculated with the software (Acqknowledge 4.2 for
MP Systems, Biopac Systems Inc., Goleta, USA). The MEP area
(MEParea) was manually calculated and then averaged for the four
brief submaximal contractions performed at 10% MVC, and was
normalized for the M-wave area (MEParea/M-wave ratio) obtained
during the 10% MVC contraction. This procedure was performed
both for VL muscle (VLMEParea/M-wave ratio) and BF muscle
(BFMEParea/M-wave ratio). The following MEP parameters were
also calculated: MEP peak to peak amplitude (MEPamp), MEP peak
to peak duration (MEPdur). The MEP cortical silent period (CSP) was
measured from the onset of the MEP to the return of EMG signal.
The isotime data of RPE, PAIN and HR were measured at the
selected time points to allow the within-subjects comparison of
temporal changes during the cycling TTF test. The shortest TTF test
was identified for each individual over the three visits and
considered as 100% isotime. The values for each variable obtained at
the final minute of the shortest cycling TTF test was compared to
the value obtained at the equivalent minute in the other two visits.
The minute identified as 100% isotime was divided by four and
rounded up to obtain the necessary value corresponding to 25, 50
and 75% isotime. Isotime values for 0% were attained by taking into
account data collected at 30 s of each cycling TTF test [35,36].
Statistical analysis
Unless specified, data are presented as mean ± SD. Assumption
of statistical tests such as normal distribution was checked by using
the Shapiro-Wilk and sphericity of data was checked by using the
Mauchly's test. The Greenhouse-Geisser correction to the degrees
of freedom was applied when violations to sphericity were present.
A one-way measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated
measures was used to compare TTF across the tDCS conditions and
to check whether there was a statistical significance at baseline for
MVC, VAL, Doublet, CSP, MEPdur, MEPamp and VLMEParea/M-wave
ratio and BFMEParea/M-wave ratio. Furthermore, intraclass corre-
lation coefficient (ICC) was also calculated according to Hopkins
et al. [37].
A 3 � 5 fully repeated measures (condition x time) ANOVA were
performed to test the effects of tDCS condition on RPE, PAIN and HR
during the cycling TTF test. The effects of tDCS condition on RPE,
PAIN, HR and DB[La�] at task failure were analysed by using the
Friedman test because the normal distribution assumption was
violated. A 3 � 2 fully repeated measures (condition x test) ANOVA
was performed to verify the effect of condition on MVC, VAL,
Doublet, MEPamp, MEPdur, VLMEParea/M-wave ratio, BFMEParea/M-
wave ratio and CSP measured before and after tDCS. When a sig-
nificant simple main effect of time or condition was found, a Holm-
Bonferroni follow-up test was performed. Correlation coefficients
(r) were determined by using Pearson's r. Post-hoc analysis for
Friedman test was performed by means of multiple comparison
with the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test. Pearson correlation was
computed to observe the relationships between MEP change and
change in TTF. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Statistics
analysis was performed by using SPSS version 20.
Results
Effects of tDCS on neuromuscular function and corticospinal
response
All participants completed the three experimental visits. Par-
ticipants reported an itching sensation on the scalp in all the tDCS
conditions and none reported any side effects during, or after tDCS
administration.
There were no statistical differences at baseline between each
experimental condition for MVC (P ¼ 0.822), VAL (P ¼ 0.348),
Doublet (P ¼ 0.671), MEPamp (P ¼ 0.176), MEPdur (P ¼ 0.340),
VLMEParea/M-wave ratio (P ¼ 0.108) and BFMEParea/M-wave ratio
(P ¼ 0.885), CSP (P ¼ 0.466). ICC of reliability data with upper and
lower 95% confidence intervals for MVC, VAL, Doublet, MEPamp,
MEPdur, VLMEParea/M-wave ratio, BFMEParea/M-wave ratio and CSP
were reported in Table 1.

 There were no significant interactions and no significant main
effects of condition or time on MVC, VAL, Doublet, MEPdur, BFME-
Parea/M-wave ratio and CSP (all Ps > 0.208) (see Figs. 3 and 4). There
were, however, significant condition by time interactions for

There was a significant main effect of condition on TTF
(P ¼ 0.003). Follow-up tests showed a significantly longer TTF in the
ANODAL condition (13.25 ± 4.34 min) compared to CATHODAL
(11.10

(10.76 ± 3.03 min, P ¼ 0.024). No significant difference between
CATHODAL and SHAM conditions was found (P ¼ 0.1) (see Fig. 2).
Analyses of isotime data revealed significant main effects of
time for RPE, PAIN and HR (all Ps < 0.001), but no condition � time
interactions were found (all Ps > 0.305). A simple main effect of
condition for RPE was found (P ¼ 0.001). Specifically, participants
rated perceived exertion lower in the ANODAL condition compared
to
CATHODAL
condition
(P

and
SHAM
condition
(P ¼ 0.008). No significant main effects of condition were found for
PAIN (P ¼ 0.305) or HR (P ¼ 0.803).
A main effect of condition for both HR (P ¼ 0.004) and DB[La�]
(P < 0.001) at task failure was found. Follow up tests revealed a
higher HR in the ANODAL condition (174 ± 14 bpm) compared to
CATHODAL condition (170 ± 15, P ¼ 0.023) and SHAM condition
(171 ± 14, P ¼ 0.003). Follow up tests revealed a higher DB[La�] in
the ANODAL condition (13.26 ± 4.47 mmol l�1) compared to
CATHODAL condition (9.90 ± 2.51 mmol l�1, P ¼ 0.011) and SHAM
condition (9.09 ± 2.33 mmol l�1, P ¼ 0.006). RPE and PAIN were not
significantly different at task failure (P ¼ 0.779 and P ¼ 0.326
respectively) (see Fig. 2). There was no correlation between MEP
change and TTF (P ¼ 0.377, r ¼ �0.281).
Discussion
The present study demonstrates that extracephalic anodal
stimulation over bilateral M1 significantly improves TTF during
cycling exercise by 23%. As hypothesised, this positive effect on
endurance performance occurred alongside a lower perception of
effort during cycling exercise. Cathodal stimulation over bilateral
M1 using the same montage did not have any significant effect on
these variables.
Effect of anodal tDCS on endurance performance
To the best of our knowledge only four studies have previously
investigated the effects of tDCS on various measures of endurance
performance [17e19,21]. In a previous study from our laboratory,
we found no significant changes in TTF during cycling exercise
when a cephalic montage was administered with a single anodal
electrode over one M1 and with the cathode over contralateral
prefrontal cortex [21]. The lack of improvement in endurance per-
formance in that study may be explained by the isolated effect of
the anodal electrode over the left M1 while cycling exercise re-
quires both legs. The absence of a significant effect on TTF may also
be due to the tDCS montage used as any benefit from the anodal
electrode over M1 could have been negated by the cathodal elec-
trode over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F4). These
speculations are supported by the results of a recent study showing
that extracephalic montage with anode over M1 and cathode over
the ipsilateral shoulder elicits a significant 17% improvement in TTF
during single leg isometric exercise [11]. Contrarily, in the same
study, the cephalic montage with the anode over M1 and cathode
over the opposite dorsolateral prefrontal cortex did not have any
significant effect on this kind of endurance performance.
On the basis of previous studies implicating the SMA in the
generation of perception of effort during physical tasks [27,28,38],
Vitor-Costa et al. [19] placed the center of one electrode (9 � 4 cm)
over Cz region (both SMA), thus each side (4.5 cm) were also placed
over both M1, and found a significant improvement in TTF during
cycling exercise following anodal stimulation. This finding suggests
that anodal stimulation of cortical areas upstream of M1 may also
improve endurance cycling performance. However, the mecha-
nisms for this ergogenic effect are not clear as the hypothesised
reduction in perception of effort was only a trend (P ¼ 0.07) and no
electrophysiological or neuromuscular parameters were measured.
Three other studies investigated the effects of an electrode
montage aimed at reducing the perception of effort via the stim-
ulation of the insular cortex (tDCS with anodal electrode over T3
and cathodal over the contralateral supraorbital area, Fp2) [17,18].
The results, however, are contrasting. Okano et al. [18], reported a
reduction in perception of effort and ~4% improvement in peak
power output during an incremental cycling test, whereas Barwood
et al. [17], did not find any perceptual or performance improvement
during a cycling TTF and time trial test in the heat. Although testing
and environmental differences may explain these contrasting re-
sults, further replications are needed to establish the ergogenic
effect of this specific tDCS procedure.

 to investigate the effects of tDCS on the force-generating capacity of
the locomotor muscles. The latter can significantly affect perception
of effort and endurance performance during cycling exercise
[39,40]. Similar to previous findings [11], acute anodal stimulation
over M1 did not change MVC torque, VAL and doublet torque of the
knee extensor muscles. In healthy participants an increase in MVC
force after anodal stimulation over M1 has been reported only for
the pinching muscle in the foot [41].
There is a limited number of studies in healthy participants
investigating the effects of tDCS administration on lower limb
motor cortex [11,41e44]. In line with previous experiments, the
findings of the current study demonstrated an increased cortico-
spinal excitability of the VL after anodal stimulation over M1
[42,43], as demonstrated by the increase MEParea/M-wave ratio and
MEPamp without any significant change in the MEP size of the
antagonist muscle (BF). In support of this, Krishan et al. [45] re-
ported an increase in activation of the bicep brachii (agonist mus-
cle) with no effect on the tricep brachii (antagonist muscle).
However, it is important to note that our protocol was designed to
evaluate the response of the knee extensor muscles, and therefore
was not optimised to detect possible changes in corticospinal
excitability of BF muscle. Therefore, further studies should be per-
formed to clarify the potential effect of tDCS on selective muscle
recruitment.
Similarly to our findings, cathodal stimulation failed to induce
suppression of corticospinal excitability [42]. The lack of dimin-
ished corticospinal excitability in the CATHODAL condition in this
study is in contrast to previous studies which have investigated

 tDCS effects on the upper limb [2]. These conflicting findings might
be caused by fewer inhibitory circuits available to suppress leg
excitability compared to the hand, or due to a different neuroana-
tomical structure and orientation of the leg motor cortex, which
make cathodal stimulation less effective [42]. Further, the different
cortical organization and projection to the spinal cord between
upper and lower limbs might explain the lack of effect [46,47].
Effects of tDCS on physiological and perceptual responses during
cycling exercise
In the current study, HR increased over time and similarly to DB
[La�] was significantly higher at task failure in the ANODAL con-
dition compared to SHAM and CATHODAL conditions, most likely
because of the longer exercise duration [48]. Our results are in line
with previous findings where anodal stimulation over the M1 did
not induce significant changes in HR response [11,21] or other
cardiovascular and autonomic parameters at a given time point
during exercise [22,23]. A reduction in HR has been previously re-
ported during the initial phases of a maximal incremental cycling
test [18] albeit in this study anodal stimulation was administered
over T3.
Contrarily to previous studies where anodal stimulation over
M1 induced changes in pain perception during various types of
experimentally induced pain [49,50], our data did not show any
significant effect on exercise-induced muscle pain. Previous studies
did not elicit any analgesic effect of tDCS on PAIN during cycling
[21] or isometric exercise [11,14]. As discussed by Angius et al. [21]
many factors could explain why exercise-induced muscle pain
seems to be insensitive to the analgesic effects of tDCS with anode
over M1. These factors include the type of nociceptive stimulus,
attentional focus, release of endogenous opioids or catecholamines
and supraspinal nociceptive inhibitory mechanisms.
As hypothesised, RPE during cycling exercise was significantly
lower in the ANODAL condition compared to CATHODAL and SHAM
conditions. Because RPE at task failure was not significantly affected
by anodal tDCS, participants reached similar levels of RPE at task
failure later than in the other two experimental conditions. Ac-
cording to the psychobiological model of endurance performance
proposed by Marcora [39,51], this perceptual effect of anodal tDCS
is sufficient to explain its effect on performance during TTF tests.
Indeed, according to this model, which is based on motivational
intensity theory [52], task failure occurs because people voluntary
stop exercising when their perception of effort coincides with the
maximum effort they are willing to exert in order to succeed in the
task (potential motivation).
It is likely that M1 excitability was higher during cycling exercise
performed after anodal stimulation compared to both cathodal
stimulation and sham tDCS. Such effect provides a plausible
neurophysiological explanation for the observed effect on RPE
during cycling exercise. Perception of effort seems to originate from
processing of corollary discharges from cortical areas upstream of
M1 [27,28,38,53]. These cortical areas include the supplementary
motor area (SMA) and provide excitatory inputs into M1 that
eventually lead to its discharge and recruitment of the locomotor
muscles. Because locomotor muscle function (as measured by
doublet torque) was not affected by anodal tDCS, we can safely
assume that recruitment of the locomotor muscles whilst cycling at
the same power output was the same after the three tDCS condi-
tions. However, because M1 excitability was increased by anodal
stimulation, less excitatory input into M1 was required to produce
the same level of locomotor muscle recruitment. Therefore, the

voluntary activation level (VAL); Panel C shows peak torque of the doublet (Doublet). Data are presented as mean ± SD (n ¼ 12).

 activity of SMA and other motor and premotor areas providing
excitatory inputs into M1 and producing the corollary discharges
processed by the brain to generate perception of effort should be
lower after anodal stimulation compared to cathodal stimulation
and sham tDCS. Accordingly, further studies involving neuro-
imaging techniques such as fMRI or PET would be required to verify
this hypothesis and clarify the neurophysiological mechanisms for
the reduction in perception of effort.
Technical considerations and limitations
A possible limitation is that the exact propagation of the elec-
trical current in the brain for the montage used in this study is
unknown. tDCS has been demonstrated to have a widespread dis-
tribution on an area larger than the targeted one [54]. In light of
this, an accurate evaluation of the current field distribution could
optimize this montage to specifically target the brain areas of in-
terest. Another limitation is that we did not measure cortical ac-
tivity
during
cycling
exercise.
Therefore,
our
hypothesised
neurophysiological mechanisms for the reduction in perception of
effort during cycling exercise observed after anodal stimulation
remain hypothetical. Further studies using motor-related cortical
potentials [27,28], single-photon-emission computed tomography
[55], or functional magnetic resonance imaging [56] should be
carried out to test the hypotheses that i) anodal stimulation over
M1 reduces the activity of the SMA and other cortical areas
upstream of M1 during subsequent voluntary submaximal muscle
contractions, and ii) that this cortical effect is associated with a
reduction in perception of effort.
In this experiment, knee extensor muscles were used to monitor
the neuromuscular response given their role in cycling exercise.
However, it is important to recognise that other muscles contribute
to power production during cycling (e.g. calf muscle, hip muscles,
tibialis anterior) and therefore their contribution is likely to change
over time during prolonged and fatiguing cycling exercise. A
possible explanation for the lack of correlation between MEP
change and TTF might be due to the small sample size for this
experiment and higher variability of cycling TTF tests [57]. Further,
it should be taken into account that the precise neurophysiological
mechanism between excitability of M1 and perception of effort is
still not clear and therefore the relationship between these two
variables might not be direct. Further experiments would be
required to elucidate the link between these two variables.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that by applying anodal
stimulation over both M1 via an extracephalic montage improves
TTF and reduces RPE during cycling exercise in a group of healthy
participants. Our data suggest that the increase in endurance per-
formance might be the result of higher excitability of the motor
cortex leading to a reduction in perception of effort.
