Psychological distress in relation to site specific cancer mortality: 
pooling of unpublished data from 16 prospective cohort studies
G David Batty,1 Tom C Russ,2,3 Emmanuel Stamatakis,4 Mika Kivimäki1 
ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To examine the role of psychological distress (anxiety 
and depression) as a potential predictor of site specific 
cancer mortality. 
Design
Pooling of individual participant data from 16 
prospective cohort studies initiated 1994-2008.
setting
Nationally representative samples drawn from the 
health survey for England (13 studies) and the Scottish 
health survey (three studies).
PartiCiPants
163 363 men and women aged 16 or older at study 
induction, who were initially free of a cancer diagnosis, 
provided self reported psychological distress scores 
(based on the general health questionnaire, GHQ-12) 
and consented to health record linkage.
Main OutCOMe Measure
Vital status records used to ascertain death from 16 
site specific malignancies; the three Scottish studies 
also had information on cancer registration 
(incidence).
results
The studies collectively contributed an average of 9.5 
years of mortality surveillance during which there were 
16 267 deaths (4353 from cancer). After adjustment for 
age, sex, education, socioeconomic status, body mass 
index (BMI), and smoking and alcohol intake, and with 
reverse causality (by left censoring) and missing data 
(by imputation) taken into account, relative to people 
in the least distressed group (GHQ-12 score 0-6), death 
rates in the most distressed group (score 7-12) were 
consistently raised for cancer of all sites combined 
(multivariable adjusted hazard ratio 1.32, 95% 
confidence interval 1.18 to 1.48) and cancers not 
related to smoking (1.45, 1.23 to 1.71), as well as 
carcinoma of the colorectum (1.84, 1.21 to 2.78), 
prostate (2.42, 1.29 to 4.54), pancreas (2.76, 1.47 to 
5.19), oesophagus (2.59, 1.34 to 5.00), and for 
leukaemia (3.86, 1.42 to 10.5). Stepwise associations 
across the full range of distress scores were observed 
for colorectal and prostate cancer.
COnClusiOn
This study contributes to the growing evidence that 
psychological distress might have some predictive 
capacity for selected cancer presentations, in addition 
to other somatic diseases.
Introduction
Although the notion of a link between mental health and 
physical health was first advanced centuries ago,1  the 
discovery of pathogenic causes for many diseases led to 
an extended period of quiescence in this field. In recent 
decades, most research has been conducted in the con-
text of cardiovascular disease, with growing evidence 
implicating the psychological factors of psychosocial 
stress,2  cognitive function,3  and selected personality 
types (particularly neuroticism and conscientiousness)4 
 
as potentially having roles at various stages of the dis-
ease process, including acting as predictive factors, 
markers of undiagnosed pathology, triggers of clinical 
events in individuals with subclinical disease, or a con-
sequence of diagnosed somatic disease.5
The predictive capacity of a further psychological fac-
tor—psychological distress (symptoms of depression 
and anxiety)—in the development of cardiovascular 
disease has also been explored, with meta-analyses 
showing positive relations with risk of coronary heart 
disease6  and stroke.7 8  Like cardiovascular disease, 
cancer is a major cause of death and morbidity,9  yet few 
studies have examined its links with distress. Various 
mechanisms have been implicated in linking psycho-
logical distress with cancer. Recurrent exposure to emo-
tional distress could diminish natural killer cell 
function, which has been implicated in tumour cell 
control.10  Of particular relevance to hormone related 
cancers is the suggestion that symptoms of depression 
could lead to dysregulation of the hypothalamic pitu-
itary adrenal (HPA) axis, increase cortisol concentra-
tions and immunological and inflammatory responses, 
and inhibit DNA repair, so unfavourably impacting on 
multiple cancer defence processes.11  With there also 
being evidence that, relative to their non-distressed 
counterparts, people with distress symptoms are more 
likely to smoke, be sedentary, have an unfavourable 
diet, and become obese, distress could also increase 
the likelihood of cancer indirectly through these life-
style related risk factors.12

provide the best test of an association in observational

While psychological distress (symptoms of depression and anxiety) is related to

WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
A pooled analysis of unpublished raw data from 16 prospective cohort studies 
suggests associations between distress and cancer, most notably for carcinoma of 
the colorectum, prostate, pancreas, and oesophagus and for leukaemia
This adds to the growing evidence that psychological distress could have some 
predictive capacity for certain somatic diseases
With extant evidence being exclusively based on observational studies, further 
research is now required to clarify the extent to which each of the associations 
between distress and cancer is likely to be causal.

epidemiology, are generally small in size and show 
highly discordant findings with positive, null, and even 
inverse associations between distress and cancer 
reported.13 Other major gaps in understanding include 
the extent to which associations might be dependent on 
site—as cancer is not a single disease entity—and 
whether any apparent gradient could be generated by 
reverse causality—that is, distress might be a conse-
quence of the early stages of the malignancy rather than 
a potential predictor. It is also the case that some stud-
ies are insufficiently well characterised to explore alter-
native explanations for the observed associations, 
including confounding by health behaviours, socioeco-
nomic status, and systemic inflammation.
In view of the limitations of the existing evidence 
base, we pooled unpublished individual participant 
data from 16 community based prospective cohort stud-
ies that used the same methods to ascertain psycholog-
ical distress, covariates, and cancer. In contrast to the 
more common study level meta-analytical technique,13 
 
the use of unpublished raw data across a series of stud-
ies provides more precise estimates of the associations 
between uniformly defined risk markers and disease; a 
consistent approach to statistical control for plausible 
covariates and subgroup analyses; and a method that is 
less likely to suffer from publication bias, which besets 
modern epidemiology. While individual participant 
meta-analysis has been extensively applied to the study 
of the role of physiological factors for risk of disease,14 
15 
 
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first pooling of 
individual participant data on psychological distress, 
as opposed to major depression,13 and the risk of spe-
cific malignancies. In view of some of the described 
mechanisms potentially linking distress with selected 
malignancies, we hypothesised positive associations 
between distress and cancer for hormone related 
(breast, prostate, ovary) and lifestyle related (lung, col-
orectal, pancreas, oesophagus, stomach) cancers.
Methods
Participants were taken from the health survey for 
England (HSE)16  and Scottish health surveys(SHS),17 a 
series of geographically representative health examina-
tions of people from the general population. Between 
1994 and 2008, 16 independent, cross sectional, and 
methodologically near identical studies were con-
ducted on either an annual (HSE; n=13) or occasional 
basis (SHS; n=3). The original purpose of these studies 
was to monitor secular trends in health and related 
behaviours. A total of 199 504 men and women, aged 
16-107 at baseline, were surveyed, with consenting 
study members linked to national health registers for 
vital status and, in the case of the SHS only, incidence 
of cancer.
Measurement of psychological distress
During a household visit, interviewers administered 
computer assisted personal interviewing modules that 
included the 12 item version of the general health ques-
tionnaire (GHQ-12).18  A widely used measure of psycho-
logical distress in population studies, the GHQ-12 
comprises items capturing symptoms of depression and 
anxiety over the previous four weeks. Item response is 
based on a 4 point scale that signals the presence of a 
symptom (“not at all”/“same as usual” were give a 
score of 0; “more than usual”/“much more than usual,” 
a score of 1). Consistent with our previous analyses,8 
19-21 
 
we divided people into four groups: asymptomatic 
(score 0), subclinically symptomatic (1-3), symptomatic 
(4-6), and highly symptomatic (7-12). The GHQ-12 has 
been validated against standardised psychiatric inter-
views.22  
23
Measurement of cancer at baseline and covariate data
Cancer at baseline was based on self report (HSE), or 
self report and cancer registration (SHS). The validity of 
self reported cancer data has been validated against 
standard records from cancer registries. Although there 
is evidence that increased age and lower socioeconomic 
status are associated with lower levels of agreement,24 
 
the ability of people to report a past diagnosis of cancer 
accurately seems to be sufficiently high for specific can-
cer sites of relevance to our study, such as breast, pros-
tate, lung, and colon.25  Height and weight were 
measured directly, and body mass index (BMI) com-
puted. A BMI of ≥30 was used to denote obesity.26  The 
following characteristics were self reported: age on 
leaving full time education (minimum allowable age for 
leaving secondary school was 12-16 depending on 
epoch), smoking status (not a current smoker; or <5, 
5-10, 10-15, 15-20, and >20 cigarettes/day), frequency of 
alcohol consumption (never drinker, ex-drinker, 1-2 
drinks a month, 1-4 drinks a week, or ≥5 drinks a 
week),16 
17 and physical activity (five or more occasions 
of moderate to vigorous physical activity a week).
Other covariates were collected only in certain survey 
years. Area-based socioeconomic deprivation was 
derived by linking study member postcode with the 
index of multiple deprivation (HSE: 2001-6; SHS: 1995, 
1998, 2003); serum C reactive protein, a marker of sys-
temic inflammation, was measured from blood samples 
drawn by a nurse at a second home visit27  (HSE: 1998, 
2003-6; SHS: 1998, 2003); physical activity was self 
reported (HSE: 1994, 1997-99, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2008; 
SHS: 1995, 1998, 2003)28 ; and from data on quantity of 
weekly alcohol intake in surveys (HSE: 1994-95, 1997-98, 
1999-2000, 2001; SHS: 2003)29  we categorised study 
members into harmful drinkers (>14 units/week30).
Outcome ascertainment: cancer mortality 
and incidence
Study members were linked to the National Health Ser-
vice (NHS) central registries at Southport and Dumfries, 
UK, the procedures of which provide the vital status of 
study members and, when applicable, causes of death, 
which included cancer. Cancers deaths were denoted by 
cancer recorded as the underlying cause of death on the 
death certificate (as opposed to contributing cause). 
Cancer registrations for a diagnosis of a non-fatal 
malignancy (incidence) were also available for the three 
Scottish studies through the Scottish cancer registry. All 
cancers combined were denoted by ICD-9 (international

Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the present 
research question nor the outcome measures, nor were 
they involved in developing plans for recruitment, 
design, or implementation of the study. No patients 
were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of 
results. There are no plans to disseminate the results of 
the research to study participants or the relevant patient 
community.
statistical analyses
We used raw data for all study years, with the exception 
of 1996 and 2007
, when a psychological distress scale 
was not administered. In preliminary analyses, we were 
able to determine that the proportional hazards 
assumption had not been violated by inspecting the 
survival curves according to distress categories. With 
there also being no evidence of an interaction by sex for 
the association between psychological distress and 
cancer (P=0.63), we pooled data for men and women 
and adjusted the effect estimates for sex. Cox propor-
tional hazards models35 were used to compute study 
specific hazard ratios with accompanying 95% confi-
dence intervals for the association between distress and 
each cancer mortality outcome. We used calendar time 
(months) as the time scale, with survivors having a cen-
soring date of 15 February 2011. Hazard ratios were 
 
minimally adjusted (age and sex only) and maximally 
adjusted (age, sex, BMI, educational attainment, smok-
ing status, and frequency of alcohol consumption). In 
the main analyses, we omitted cancer endpoints with 
too few cases (<50) to provide stable effect estimates.
Subgroup analyses were conducted with data that 
were available only in selected surveys. Here, age and 
sex adjusted hazard ratios for the association between 
distress and cancer were additionally adjusted for phys-
ical activity,36  C reactive protein,37  area level depriva-
tion,38  and harmful levels of alcohol intake39 in turn, all 
of which have been linked with selected malignancies 
featured in the present analyses. We also constructed 
models using cancer incidence (for SHS only) to com-
pare with results for distress and mortality in this group 
of studies.
We used the I2 statistic as a measure of the degree of 
inconsistency of effect estimate (heterogeneity) across 
studies (and cancer outcomes). Although preliminary 
analyses showed that the I2 statistic between studies 
varied between 0% and 38% depending on the cancer 
mortality outcome under investigation, we pooled the 
study specific effect estimates and their standard errors 
in random effects meta-analyses to provide conserva-
tive effect estimates. All analyses were computed with R 
version 3.2.2, with the exception of data imputation, 
which was performed with SPSS (version 22). 
Results
Tables 1 and 2 show the characteristics of study mem-
bers according to each of the 16 included studies. Indi-
vidual study sample size ranged from 7405 to 14 573 
people; there was no difference in mean psychological 
distress score across the studies.
Figure 1 shows the flow of participants from study 
induction through to analytical sample. About 18% 
(n=36 141) of study members were excluded between 
recruitment and analyses, largely because of refusal to 
be linked to death or cancer registration records. Indi-
viduals with an extant cancer diagnosis at baseline 
(n=3875) were also excluded. This resulted in a maxi-
mum analytic sample of 163 363 (55% women, mean age 
46.3 (range 16-102)).
Table 3 compares the characteristics of the analytical 
sample with study members who had been excluded. In 
general, absolute differences were small, though signif-
icance at conventional levels was common because of 
the high numbers of people in the analyses. On this 
basis, there seemed to be little evidence of selection 
bias. In the analytical sample, participants were around 
middle age at study induction (mean age 46.3; range 
16-102); around half were women (54.9%), and about a 
quarter (26.3%) were smokers. Around two thirds of the 
sample left school after the mandatory age.
Based on the 163 363 study members in the sample for 
analysis, we examined baseline covariates according to 
the four categories of psychological distress (table 4). 
As anticipated, study members with higher distress 
scores had less favourable levels of a range of character-
istics, some of which are known risk factors for selected 
cancers. Thus, relative to people with lower distress lev-
els, the more distressed study members were more 
likely to have a basic education, smoke, and be obese. 
The only exception to this observation was the weekly 
intake of alcohol beverages, which was lower in people 
reporting higher levels of distress.
During a mean (SD) follow-up of 9.5 (4.3) years across 
the 16 studies there were 16 267 deaths, 4353 of which 
were ascribed to cancer of any site. Figure 2 shows the 
age and sex adjusted relation between psychological 
distress and mortality from all cancer sites combined 
according to each of the 16 studies featured in the pres-
ent meta-analysis. With the exception of three studies 
with among the lowest number of cancer deaths (1997

2005, and 2006 HSE), relative to individuals reporting 
lower distress scores (0-6), those with higher levels 
(7-12) experienced increased rates of total cancer mor-
tality, though confidence intervals for all but five 
 
studies included unity. An I2 statistic of 2% suggests 
essentially no statistical heterogeneity in the study spe-
cific estimates. In the 16 studies in aggregate, after 
adjustment for age and sex, higher levels of distress 
were associated with a 32% greater risk of total cancer 
mortality (hazard ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval 
1.18 to 1.48).
Figure 3 shows analyses for distress according to 16 
independent (non-overlapping) cancer presentations 
plus some of these sites in aggregate (total cancer and 
cancers related and not related to smoking). For all the 
malignancy endpoints featured in analyses in which 
hazard ratios were adjusted for age and sex, higher 
death rates were apparent in people with higher levels 
of distress, though significance at conventional levels 
was not always apparent. Thus, of the individual sites, 
in the model with age and sex, the weakest effects were 
seen for lung cancer and the strongest for mesotheli-
oma. Some of these estimates were imprecise, as evi-
denced by the wide confidence intervals because of a 
low number of cancer deaths. We also show the impact 
of adjustment for a range of further covariates. Relative 
to the age and sex adjusted hazard ratios, adjustment 
for covariates that included socioeconomic position 
(education) and health behaviours (cigarette smoking, 
alcohol intake) had little attenuating effect; indeed, in 
some cases, positive confounding was apparent. One 
exception was tobacco related cancer (including lung), 
for which, unsurprisingly, the addition of smoking to 
the multivariable model led to partial attenuation of the 
association with distress (table A in appendix 1 shows 
the impact of control for individual confounding factors 
in the multivariable model).
Table 5 shows the four categories of psychological 
distress we used to explore dose-response associations 
with different presentations of cancer. In these analyses 
there was some evidence of stepwise effects across the 
full distress range for cancer of the colorectum and 
prostate. With different models being based on different 
analytical samples because of missing covariates, we 
recomputed these effects estimates in a non-missing 
dataset—that is, the same sample size in both models—
and our results were unchanged.
We then carried out some planned subgroup analy-
ses. Firstly, as described, certain potential covariates 
(physical activity, C reactive protein, area based depri-
vation, quantity of alcohol consumed) were collected 
only in selected studies and therefore did not feature in 
our main analyses. Because of the smaller numbers, we 
were able to examine the impact of adjustment for these 
covariates only on the relation between distress and all 
cancers combined (table B in appendix 1). The strength 
of the relation between distress and total cancer was 
little changed. Secondly, to explore the role of reverse 
causality—people entering the studies might have some 
symptoms of undiagnosed cancer, including pain and 
tiredness, which could cause, or be taken for, mental

distress—we excluded study members who died in the 
first five years of follow-up from the particular endpoint 
featured in each analysis. In doing so, we found that 
most of the associations between distress and cancer 
were largely unaffected (fig A in appendix 2).
Thirdly, in related analyses, given that death data 
combine both incidence and survival, we examined if 
there was a relation between distress and incidence 
based on registration of a cancer diagnosis (data avail-
able only for the three Scottish studies) as this is more 
proximal to the exposure of interest and therefore the 
analyses potentially provide greater insights into aetiol-
ogy. Figure 4 shows that there was some evidence of 
differential effects for cancer of all locations combined 
and colorectal cancer, such that the associations 
between distress and incidence were weaker, though 
the latter analysis particularly was compromised by rel-
atively few events.
Lastly, 18% (n=36 141) of study members were 
excluded between recruitment and analyses, largely 
because of refusal to be linked to death or cancer regis-
tration records (fig 1 ). Accordingly, for each of the 16 
cohort studies in the analysis we used multiple multi-
variate imputation based on baseline variables avail-
able for any missing values. We ran five cycles of 
regression, which generated five imputation datasets 
for each of the 16 studies, and the results were obtained 
by averaging results across each of these five datasets 
using the approach of Rubin.40 This procedure takes 
into account the uncertainty in the imputation process 
as well as uncertainty from random variation. 
Meta-analysis of the results from these imputed study 
specific data (table C in appendix 1) gave similar results 
to those seen with the non-missing dataset as reported 
in the present paper. 
discussion
Principal findings
In this pooling of unpublished individual participant 
data, we found that people in the highest distress 
grouping relative to the lowest experienced increased 
rates of death from selected cancers. Thus, after adjust-
ment for covariates that are known risk factors for 
selected malignancies, such as adverse health 
behaviours, and with reverse causality (by left censor-
ing) and missing data (by imputation) taken into con-
sideration, the most consistently robust effects were 
evident for carcinoma of the colorectum, prostate, pan-
creas, and oesophagus and for leukaemia. For two of 
these malignancies—colorectal and prostate—a gradi-
ent was apparent, such that the greater level of distress, 
the higher the risk of cancer mortality. These associa-
tions provide partial support for our hypotheses based 
on plausible mechanisms of effect.
usefulness of the present study
Our findings could be important in advancing under-
standing of the role of psychological distress in cancer 
aetiology and cancer progression as investigators 
attempt to ascertain what role this and other psycholog-
ical factors (such as psychosocial stress, cognition, 
 
personality, life satisfaction) have, if any, in prevention 
and prognosis. By contextualising the predictive value 
of distress for risk of cancer by comparing it with estab-
lished non-psychological risk factors using data from 
the present study (table D in appendix 1), it is evident

that, aside from lung cancer for which cigarette smok-
ing has a known causal influence, the hazard ratios for 
higher levels of distress are of similar magnitude to 
those for current smoking and obesity for selected can-
cer presentations. Individually, however, none of these 
risk factors is powerful enough to determine a person’s 
risk: in analyses of death from a common cancer such 
as colorectal for instance, the sensitivity—the propor-
tion of people who went on to develop a disease who 
also had the risk factor at baseline—was only 8% for 
psychological distress, 17% for current cigarette smok-
ing, and 27% for obesity. As has been shown for cardio-
vascular disease, however, where multifactorial 
algorithms are in widespread use in general practice 
(such as Framingham,41  QRisk42 ), collectively, these 
and other risk factors might have predictive utility for 
common cancer presentations (such as colorectal, 
breast, prostate). In developing such algorithms, psy-
chological distress could be considered as a compo-
nent, which is not currently the case.43  That these risk 
factors collectively have predictive value for selected 
cancers, together with the well established observa-
tions that cancers rates differ systematically across 
time,44  location,45  and migration pattern,46  strongly 
suggest that the initiation of cancers is not a simple sto-
chastic process reflecting the number of tissue specific 
stem cell divisions,47  as has been suggested.48
study strengths and limitations
Our study has some strengths, including the use of 
unpublished raw data from similarly conducted studies 
in the general population; as such, our findings are not 
subject to publication bias and comparison across stud-
ies is straightforward. We also used a large and well 
characterised dataset relative to many other studies in 
this specialty. Our work is of course not without its lim-
itations. The assessment of psychological distress with 
the GHQ-12 referenced the preceding four week period. 
A short bout of distress is unlikely to be of aetiological 
relevance for a disease like cancer, which has a long 
induction period. There is evidence, however, that rates 
of recurrence are high for psychological distress. For 
instance, in a population of 4363 people in a similar age 
range to the present study members, we found that, 
based on the general health questionnaire (30 items) 
over a maximum of 19 years of surveillance (four phases 
of data collection), two thirds of the sample classified as 
distressed at baseline were also distressed on one or 
more occasion during follow-up. This is broadly consis-
tent with findings for clinical depression.49 Thus, a sin-
gle administration of a distress inventory seems to 
capture cases of long term depression and anxiety. This 
notwithstanding, having serial measurement of our 
exposure would have provided further insights into the 
chronicity of psychological distress and would have the 
added advantage of allowing us to mimic a trial in an 
observational context by identifying a group whose 
depression resolved over time and observing the occur-
rence of cancer in this group. 
While we chose to include an array of cancer out-
comes to explore specificity of association, not all of 
these were hypothesis driven. It is also the case that, 
given that our meta-analysis is based on observational 
studies, as well characterised as these studies were, 
confounding by known or unknown factors remains a 
perennial concern. The assessment of dietary charac-
teristics, for example, was an omission. This problem 
could theoretically be circumvented in a randomised 
controlled trial of people undergoing treatment for 
depression and anxiety who are also subject to surveil-
lance for cancer events where, if it is genuinely causal, 
a reversal of symptoms of distress would produce a 
lower rate of cancer in treated patients. While such an 
aetiological trial has been conducted in the context of 
cardiovascular disease— reduction in depression pro-
duced a lower risk of total mortality in one50  but had no 
impact on myocardial reinfarction rates in another51 —
the logistics involved with the size and duration of a 
trial for multiple cancer presentations are likely to be 
prohibitive. An alternative but related approach would 
be to use Mendelian randomisation in the context of

observational data in which a gene variant for psycho-
logical distress in principle provides an unconfounded 
estimate of the relation between an exposure and a 
 
disease outcome.52  As the genes for depression get 
identified,53 this represents a realistic proposition; 
unfortunately, the studies that comprise the present 
collaboration did not capture genetic material.
Comparison with other studies
The present analyses considerably extend our existing 
work,21  where we have shown that higher levels of dis-
tress were related to major causes of mortality, includ-
ing cardiovascular disease, external causes of death, 
and all cancers combined, by exploring the link 
between distress and 16 different cancer presentations. 
We are not aware of previous meta-analyses on symp-
toms of psychological distress in relation to site specific 
cancer. In a recent meta-analysis of the occurrence of 
cancer subsequent to the assessment of major depres-
sion,13  which used study rather than individual level 
data and excluded studies in which investigators cap-
tured depressive symptoms, the aggregated result for 
depression and cancer for all malignancies across the 
13 studies included unity (relative risk 1.12, 95% confi-
dence interval 0.99 to 1.26). This was of markedly lower 
magnitude than our estimate between psychological 
distress and overall cancer (multivariable adjusted haz-
ard ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 1.48). The 
discordant findings of prospective studies published 
since that meta-analysis have not clarified matters.54-60 
 
Even within the same study, all cancers combined 
showed opposing gradients with depression in sex 
stratified analyses.59  Studies of sufficient scale to 
explore site specific associations with depression are 
rare, and the few that have been  
conducted show null 
effects for colon, lung, and prostate.57 
60
Mechanisms of effect
Cancer mortality according to anatomical site—the 
main outcome in our study—is a composite of the onset 
of cancer (aetiology) together with survival from the 
disease (prognosis). The influence of psychological dis-
tress on processes acting at either or both of these dis-
ease stages could therefore influence the risk of cancer 
mortality. Moreover, these mechanisms can be direct 
(biological) and/or indirect (behavioural), and their 
action cancer specific and/or common to multiple pre-
sentations.
People with chronic distress typically have a less 
favourable lifestyle relative to those with lower levels,12 
 
and this has been advanced as one means by which dis-
tress can be embodied, so increasing the risk of cancer. 
While we controlled for cigarette smoking, heavy alco-
hol intake, and physical inactivity in our analyses—and 
the associations held—health seeking behaviours might 
also be important, perhaps at a later stage in the dis-
ease process. Thus, people who are distressed might be 
less likely to comply with requests for screening,61

resulting in a delayed diagnosis, and, once cancer is 
diagnosed, depression might hamper adherence to 
treatment.62  These findings, however, are notuniver-
sal.63 We did not collect data on treatment behaviours in 
the present study.
Of the biological mechanisms, mood disorders such 
as depression have been implicated in immune path-
ways and are known to provoke inflammatory 
responses. Prolonged immune dysregulation can com-
promise the repair capacity of the exposed cells, poten-
tially contributing to genetic instability and mutations, 
alterations in DNA repair, and inhibition of apopto-
sis.64 
65  Immune dysregulation can also lead to a worse 
prognosis for several carcinomas, including cancer of 
the colorectum, lung, mesothelium, and stomach.66 
 
Depression and distress are also associated with mark-
ers of increased inflammation, such as interleukin 6, 
high sensitivity C reactive protein, and soluble tumour 
necrosis factor receptor.67  In subgroup analyses, the 
associations between distress and cancer we observed 
were unchanged after the addition of circulating C reac-
tive protein concentrations to the multivariable model, 
but we did not have data on a wider suite of inflamma-
tory indicators. The lack of specificity of the relation 
between distress and cancer site in our analyses did not 
provide unambiguous insights into potential mecha-
nisms, though, in general, the associations seemed 
stronger for some hormone related cancers, such as car-
cinoma of the prostate and ovaries. This observation 
accords with the notion of stress related mechanisms, 
which include dysregulation of the hypothalamic pitu-
itary adrenal (HPA)68  and sympathetic adrenal medul-
lary (SAM) axes.69
exploring the role of reverse causality
It is plausible that the associations we found between 
distress and cancer reflect both the effects of cancer—
diagnosed and undiagnosed—on mood, the effects of 
distress on cancer progression, or a combination. As 
described, it is well documented that a diagnosis of can-
cer can give rise to distress,70 and we dealt with this 
potential source of reverse causality by using the stan-
dard practice of excluding members with self reported 
malignancy at study entry. Having done so, when we 
explored the risk between distress and total cancer 
according to study, those with longer follow-up gener-
ally showed weaker associations. As duration of fol-
low-up increases, the proportion of surviving people 
who had entered the study with unknown cancer dimin-
ishes relative to the total number of deaths from cancer; 
the influence of cancer on distress should likewise wane 
over time. Moreover, in analyses of the Scottish studies, 
the associations were somewhat weaker for cancer inci-
dence than for cancer mortality, though these analyses 
were not well powered because of the lower number of 
new cancer cases. Taking these observations together, 
there was a suggestion that subclinical malignancy 
might have had an impact on mood. Thus, to explore the 
impact of occult cancer, we excluded study members 
who died in the first five years of follow-up. This practice 
is based on the assumption that people with occult can-
cers of the more lethal variety will have died during this 
period. In these analyses, the gradients between distress 
and cancer were, however, still seen.
In conclusion, our findings add to the growing evi-
dence of an association between psychological distress 
and physical conditions by characterising new rela-
tions with death from selected cancer presentations. 
The extent to which these associations could be causal 
requires further testing with alternative study designs.
