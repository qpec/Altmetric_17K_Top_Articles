ABSTRACT
Background: There is little information about the associations of
intakes of cholesterol and eggs, a major source of dietary cho-
lesterol, with the risk of cognitive decline in general populations
or in carriers of apolipoprotein E e4 (APO-E4), a major risk
factor for dementia.
Objective: We investigated the associations of cholesterol and egg
intakes with incident dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD), and cog-
nitive performance in middle-aged and older men from Eastern
Finland.
Design: A total of 2497 dementia-free men, aged 42–60 y in 1984–
1989 at the baseline examinations of the prospective, population-
based Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study, were
included in the study. Information on the apolipoprotein E (Apo-E)
phenotype was available for 1259 men. Data on cognitive perfor-
mance tests at the 4-y re-examinations were available for 480 men.
Dietary intakes were assessed with the use of 4-d food records at
baseline. Dementia and AD diagnoses were based on Finnish
health registers. Cox regression and ANCOVA were used for
the analyses.
Results: During the 21.9-y follow-up, 337 men were diagnosed
with dementia, and 266 men were diagnosed with AD. Neither
cholesterol nor egg intake was associated with a higher risk of in-
cident dementia or AD. For example, when evaluated continuously, each
intake of 100 mg cholesterol/d was associated with a multivariable-
adjusted HR of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.02) for incident dementia,
and each additional 0.5 egg (27 g)/d was associated with an HR of
0.89 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.01). However, egg intake was associated with
better performance on neuropsychological tests of the frontal lobe
and executive functioning, the Trail Making Test, and the Verbal
Fluency Test. The Apo-E4 phenotype did not modify the associa-
tions of cholesterol or egg intake (P-interactions . 0.11).
Conclusions: Neither cholesterol nor egg intake is associated with
an increased risk of incident dementia or AD in Eastern Finnish
men. Instead, moderate egg intake may have a beneficial associ-
ation with certain areas of cognitive performance.

INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of dementia is expected to triple by the year 2050,
when there will be .115 million people in the world who are
suffering from dementia (1). A high serum cholesterol concentra-
tion is a known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)5 (2)
and for dementia (3). Furthermore, Alzheimer disease (AD) and
CVD share the same risk gene, apolipoprotein E e4 (APO-E4) (4).
The prevalence of APO-E4 varies worldwide (5), but in Finland,
one-third of the population has $1 of the e4 alleles (6).
Egg has traditionally been stigmatized with warnings because
of its high content of cholesterol, but recent studies have chal-
lenged the role of dietary cholesterol or egg intake in disease
etiology (7, 8). For most people, the effect of dietary cholesterol
on plasma cholesterol concentrations is minor (9), and cholesterol
or egg intake has not been shown to be associated with CVD risk
in general populations (8, 10, 11). The impact of dietary cho-
lesterol on serum cholesterol is enhanced in APO-E4 carriers
(12), but dietary cholesterol or egg intake has not been associ-
ated with a higher CVD risk in these carriers either (13). There
has been a limited number of studies concerning the impact of
dietary cholesterol on dementia risk, and most of the studies
have been conducted with the use of animals. These experiments
have shown an association between dietary cholesterol and
AD-type pathologies (14–18), but such associations have not
been shown in human studies (19, 20). To the best of our
knowledge, the impact of egg intake on incident dementia risk
has not been studied before, although some studies have shown a
beneficial association with mild cognitive impairment (21, 22).

 In this study we examined the associations of cholesterol and
egg intakes with incident dementia in 2497 men from Eastern
Finland. In a subset of 1259 men, we investigated whether the
Apo-E4 phenotype modified the associations. We also examined
the associations of cholesterol and egg intakes with cognitive
performance 4 y after the baseline examinations in a subset of 480
men.
METHODS
Study population
The KIHD (Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor
Study) was designed to investigate risk factors for CVD, athero-
sclerosis, and related outcomes in a prospective, population-based
sample of men from Eastern Finland (23). Baseline examinations
were carried out in 1984–1989. A total of 2682 men aged 42, 48,
54, or 60 y at baseline (82.9% of eligible men) were recruited in 2
cohorts (Supplemental Figure 1). The first cohort consisted of
1166 men who were 54 y old and were enrolled in 1984–1986,
and the second cohort included 1516 men who were 42, 48, 54 or
60 y old and were enrolled in 1986–1989. The baseline exami-
nations were followed by the 4-y examination round in 1991–
1993 in which 1038 men from the second cohort (88% of eligible
subjects) participated. Baseline characteristics of the entire study
population have been described previously (24). The KIHD pro-
tocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the
University of Kuopio. All subjects gave written informed consent
for participation.
Cholesterol and egg intakes and dementia incidence
Subjects with a history of a mental problem (including de-
mentia) at baseline (n = 144) or with missing diet data (n = 41)
were excluded, which left 2497 men for the analyses of incident
dementia.
Cholesterol and egg intakes and dementia incidence: influence
of Apo-E phenotype
The Apo-E phenotype was determined from blood samples of
1033 men who participated in the 4-y examinations and from 307
other men from the baseline examinations for whom blood
samples for phenotyping were available. Of these 1340 men,
subjects with a history of a mental problem at baseline (n = 70) or
with missing diet information (n = 11) were excluded, which left
1259 men for the analyses of incident dementia. Compared with
subjects without data on the Apo-E phenotype, subjects with
these data were, in general, healthier and had more favorable
lifestyles and dietary habits, although their serum lipid and li-
poprotein profiles were less favorable (13).
Cholesterol and egg intakes and cognitive performance
Cognitive performance tests at the 4-y examinations in 1991–
1993 were performed by 519 of 555 men who belonged to the 2
oldest age groups at the baseline examinations in 1986–1989
(i.e. men who were 54 or 60 y old). Of these men, we excluded
individuals with a history of a mental problem (n = 31) or with
missing diet (n = 6) or Apo-E phenotype (n = 2) data, which left
480 men for the analyses. We did not have data on cognitive
performance tests at baseline.
Assessment of dietary intakes
The consumption of foods was assessed at baseline in 1984–
1989 with the use of a 4-d guided food record, 1 d of which
was a weekend day, by using household measures. A picture
book of common foods and dishes was used to help in the es-
timation of portion sizes. The picture book contained 126 of the
most common foods and drinks that are consumed in Finland,
and for each food item, the participant could choose from 3 to 5
commonly used portion sizes or could describe the portion size
in relation to those in the book. To further improve accuracy,
instructions were given and completed food records were
checked by a nutritionist together with a participant. Nutrient
intakes were estimated with the use of NUTRICA 2.5 software
(Social Insurance Institution). The databank of the software is
mainly based on Finnish values of the nutrient compositions
of foods. Nutrient intakes were energy adjusted with the use of
the residual method. The egg-consumption variable represented
total egg consumption and included the intake of eggs in mixed
dishes and recipes.
Measurements
Venous blood samples were collected between 0800 and 1000
at the baseline examinations in 1984–1989. Subjects were in-
structed to abstain from ingesting alcohol for 3 d and from
smoking and eating for 12 h before giving the sample. Detailed
descriptions of the determination of serum lipids and lipopro-
teins (25) and the assessments of patient medical history and
medication use at baseline (25), family history of diseases (25),
smoking (25), alcohol intake (25), blood pressure (25), and
physical activity (26) were previously published. Serum high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured with the use
of an immunometric assay (Immulite High Sensitivity CRP
Assay; DPC). Education was assessed in years with the use of a
self-administered questionnaire. The Apo-E phenotype was de-
termined from plasma with the use of isoelectric focusing and
immunoblotting techniques. Subjects who had the phenotype 3/4
or 4/4 were included in the Apo-E4 group.
Neuropsychological tests
At the 4-y examinations in 1991–1993, cognitive function was
measured with the use of the following 5 neuropsychological
tests: the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Trail Making Test,
the Verbal Fluency Test, the Selective Reminding Test, and
Russell’s adaptation of the Visual Reproduction Test (27–31).
The tests were administered by interviewers who were trained in
neuropsychological assessment. Each of the tests has been val-
idated in the Finnish population (32).
The Mini-Mental State Examination has been widely used
in both population-based and clinical research to test for the
presence of cognitive impairment and as a screening tool for
dementia. The test assesses orientation (10 items), registration (3
items), attention and calculation (5 items), recall (3 items), and
language (9 items). A correct response to each item scores 1 (an
incorrect response scores 0), and the scores are summed to give a
potential maximum score of 30. Higher scores indicate better
cognitive function.
The Trail Making Test is a test of frontal lobe functioning
as indicated by perceptual motor speed, visual searching and

 sequencing, and the ability to make alternating conceptual shifts
(33). The original version of the test consisted of 2 parts (A and
B), but in the current study, we used part A. Performance was
judged in terms of the number of seconds that were required to
complete the test.
The Verbal Fluency Test is a test of language performance that
assesses an individual’s ability to spontaneously produce words
under the restrictions of a limited letter category and is also a
test of frontal lobe functioning, particularly of the left frontal
lobe (33). Participants were asked to generate as many words as
possible that began with the letters P, A, and S; 60 s were al-
located for each letter. Different forms of the same word and
proper names of people or places were not counted as correct.
Performance was assessed by counting the number of words
produced during the 3-min period with higher scores indicating
better language facility.
The Selective Reminding Test examines storage, retention, and
the retrieval of information from short- and long-term memory
and learning abilities. Participants were initially read 10 un-
related words in w20 s and were asked to recall the entire list in
any order. Participants were read only those words that they
failed to recall after the first reading and were again asked to
recall the entire list of 10 words. This procedure was repeated
6 times, and the participant’s score was the total number of
words recalled correctly (potential maximum score of 60).
Russell’s adaptation of the Visual Reproduction Test exam-
ines visual memory for nonrepresentative figures (right temporal
lobe functioning) and constructional ability. Participants were
initially shown a single geometric figure for 10 s, after which the
figure was removed from view, and the participant was required
to draw the figure from memory. This procedure was repeated
with a figure of greater complexity and then again for a third
time, although on this occasion, the participant was asked to
draw 2 figures. Scoring was based on the degree to which the
participant was able to correctly and accurately replicate the
figures (potential maximum score of 21).
Ascertainment of follow-up events
Three national health registers were used to identify incident
cases of dementia or AD in the KIHD cohort by the end of the
year 2014. Computer linkages to the Care Register (hospital-
discharge data) (34) and Causes of Death register (35) were
applied with the use of International Classification of Diseases
(ICD)-8 code 290, ICD-9 codes 4378A and 290, and ICD-10
codes F00, F01, F02, F03, G30, and G31 to identify persons
with dementia and ICD-8 codes 29000 and 29010, ICD-9 codes
290 and 3310A, and ICD-10 codes F00 and G30 were used to
identify cases of AD. Since 1999, a few years after the first drugs
for symptomatic treatment of AD were launched, a diagnosis of
AD was recorded in the Special Reimbursement Register (SRR),
which is maintained by the Social Insurance Institution of Fin-
land. The SRR is often used as a clinical epidemiology data
source for studies on specific chronic conditions (36, 37) in-
cluding the prevalence and incidence of AD (38, 39). To receive a
special reimbursement right, the patient has to be examined,
diagnosed, and given a certificate by a medical doctor, who is
usually a specialist. For a diagnosis of AD to be verified and
recorded in the SRR, the following conditions are required: the
person has 1) symptoms consistent with AD, 2) experienced a
decrease in social capacity over a period $3 mo, 3) received a
computed tomography or MRI scan, 4) had possible alternative
diagnoses excluded, and 5) received confirmation of the di-
agnosis by a registered neurologist or geriatrician. Each medical
certificate is assessed by the Social Insurance Institution to en-
sure that a patient meets the diagnostic criteria for AD of the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Version IVand of the National
Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders–Alzheimer’s
Disease and Related Disorders Association for AD (40–42). Persons
with mixed dementias of the AD and vascular and AD and Lewy
body are also recorded. Linkage to the SRR was also used in the
current study, and it proved to be strongest method to identify cases
with AD in the KIHD cohort.
Statistical analysis
The univariate relations between cholesterol and egg intakes and
baseline characteristics were assessed with the use of means and
linear regression (for continuous variables) or chi-square tests (for
bivariate relations). Cox proportional hazards regression models
were used to estimate HRs for incident dementia and AD in
quartiles of baseline cholesterol and egg intakes. The validity of the
proportional hazards assumption was evaluated with the use of
Schoenfeld residuals. The associations of baseline cholesterol and
egg intakes with cognitive-performance tests at the 4-y examina-
tions were analyzed with the use of an ANCOVA. Confounders in
the analyses were selected on the basis of established risk factors for
dementia, previously published associations with dementia (3), or
associations with exposures or outcomes in the current analysis.
Model 1 included age (years), examination year, and energy intake
(kilocalories per day). The multivariable model (model 2) included
model 1 variables and education years; smoking (cigarette packs per
day multiplied by years of smoking); BMI (in kg/m2); diabetes (yes
or no); leisure-time physical activity (kilocalories per day); history
of coronary artery disease (yes or no); use of a lipid-lowering
medication during follow-up (yes or no); and intakes of alcohol
(grams per week); fruits, berries, and vegetables (grams per day);
carbohydrates (percentage of energy); and fiber (grams per day).
Model 3 was adjusted as for model 2 and mutually for either egg
intake (grams per day) or cholesterol intake (milligrams per day).
Further adjustment for history of stroke, systolic or diastolic blood
pressure, hypertension medication use, blood glucose, serum long-
chain n–3 PUFAs, or intakes of coffee, SFAs, or PUFAs did not
appreciably affect the associations (change in estimates: ,5%). All
quantitative variables were entered as continuous variables.
The cohort mean was used to replace missing values in covariates
(,3.4%). The significance of interactions on a multiplicative scale
was assessed with the use of a stratified analysis and likelihood
ratio tests with a cross-product term. Tests of linear trend were
conducted by assigning the median values of each category of
exposure variable and treating these as a single continuous vari-
able. All P values were 2-tailed (a = 0.05). Data were analyzed
with the use of SPSS 21.0 for Windows software (IBM Corp.).

 (w4 medium-sized eggs/wk). Cholesterol intake from eggs
(mean 6 SD: 110 6 81 mg/d) accounted for 27% of total
cholesterol intake. Forty-eight percent of subjects (n = 1199)
consumed $0.5 eggs (27 g)/d. Only 27 subjects (1.1%) did not
consume eggs at all, and 3 subjects reported consuming egg
whites only.
Men with a higher cholesterol intake were less physically
active, less educated, more likely to smoke, and less likely to have
hypertension (Table 1). They had higher total-, LDL-, and HDL-
cholesterol concentrations but lower serum triglyceride con-
centrations. Their serum long-chain n–3 PUFA concentrations
were higher. They also had higher intakes of protein, SFAs,
MUFAs, and processed red meat and lower intakes of carbo-
hydrates, fiber, PUFAs, trans fatty acids, and fruit, berries, and
vegetables. Men with higher egg intakes were younger and less
likely to smoke, have hypertension, or have a history of a cor-
onary artery disease, and their serum CRP concentrations and
diastolic blood pressures were lower (Table 1). They had higher
serum HDL-cholesterol concentrations and lower serum tri-
glyceride concentrations. They also had higher intakes of en-
ergy, fiber, SFAs, MUFAs, cholesterol, dairy, and coffee and
lower intakes of carbohydrates and PUFAs.
Cholesterol and egg intakes and risk of any incident
dementia
During a mean 6 SD follow-up of 21.9 6 7.9 y, 337 men
(13.5%) were diagnosed with any incident dementia. Cholesterol
intake was not associated with risk of incident dementia (Table 2).
Egg intake had a trend toward lower risk after multivariable ad-
justments (HR for highest compared with lowest quartiles: 0.74;
95% CI: 0.53, 1.02; P-trend across quartiles = 0.04) (model 2), but
the association was NS after adjustment for cholesterol intake
(P-trend = 0.20) (model 3). When evaluated continuously, each
intake of an additional 100 mg cholesterol/d was associated with a
multivariable-adjusted HR of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.02) (model 2).
After further adjustment for egg intake, the HR was 0.97 (95% CI:
0.79, 1.19) (model 3). Each additional 0.5 eggs (27 g)/d was as-
sociated with an HR of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.01) (model 2) with
little impact after further adjustment for cholesterol intake (HR:
0.91, 95% CI: 0.74, 1.13) (model 3).
In the subset of 1259 men, 29.6% of subjects had the Apo-E3/4
phenotype, and 3.6% of subjects had the 4/4 phenotype (Table 3).
After adjustment for age and examination year, men with the
Apo-E4 phenotype had 97% (HR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.46, 2.65) higher
risk of any incident dementia compared with that of Apo-E4
noncarriers. After multivariable adjustments (model 2), the
HR was 1.97 (95% CI: 1.45, 2.68). However, the Apo-E4
phenotype did not modify the association of either cholesterol in-
take (P-interaction = 0.62) (model 2) or egg intake (P-interaction =
0.95) with risk of incident dementia.
Cholesterol and egg intakes and risk of AD
In the analyses with the incident AD diagnosis as the outcome
(266 events), HRs were 0.79 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.19; P-trend = 0.29)
for highest compared with lowest cholesterol-intake quartiles
and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.23; P-trend = 0.34) for highest
compared with lowest egg-intake quartiles (Model 2). The
associations were again attenuated after mutual adjustments
(data not shown).
In the subset of 1295 men, the Apo-E4 phenotype did not modify
the associations of either cholesterol intake (P-interaction = 0.87)
(model 2) or egg intake (P-interaction = 0.52) with incident AD
although subjects with the Apo-E4 phenotype had 127% higher risk
of developing AD (140 AD events; HR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.62, 3.18).
Cholesterol and egg intakes and cognitive performance
In the subset of 480 men, there were no significant associations
between baseline cholesterol intake and cognitive performance at

 the 4-y follow-up examinations, whereas higher egg intake was
associated with better performance in the Trail Making Test and
Verbal Fluency Test (Table 4). Further adjustment for cholesterol
intake had little impact on the results of the Trail Making Test
(P-trend = 0.04) or the Verbal Fluency Test (P-trend = 0.03). Each
additional 0.5 eggs/d was associated with a 1.9-s better perfor-
mance on the Trail Making Test (95% CI: 0, 3.8 s) (model 2) and
with a better score of 1.2 words (95% CI: 20.1, 2.4 words) on the
Verbal Fluency Test. Again, the Apo-E4 phenotype did not modify
the association of cholesterol intake (P-interaction . 0.11) or egg
intake (P-interaction . 0.24).
Sensitivity analyses
We investigated the impact of excluding men with coronary
artery disease at baseline (n = 613) because they might have
changed their dietary habits after the coronary artery disease
event, which could explain the lower number of men with a
history of coronary artery disease in subjects with higher egg
intakes (Table 1). However, this factor did not have any major
impact on the associations with incident events. For example, in
these analyses (254 events), each intake of an additional 100 mg
cholesterol/d was associated with a multivariable-adjusted HR
of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.03) (model 2) and each additional 0.5
eggs (27 g)/d was associated with an HR of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.78,
1.05) (model 2) for incident dementia. In the cognitive-performance
tests (n = 335), the inverse associations of egg intake with the
Trail Making Test and the Verbal Fluency Test were attenuated
and no longer significant. Each additional 0.5 eggs/d was as-
sociated with a 1.4-s better performance on the Trail Making
Test (95% CI: 20.9, 3.6 s) (model 2) and with a better score
of 0.7 words (95% CI: 20.9, 2.3 words) on the Verbal Fluency
Test (model 2).
DISCUSSION
In this population-based cohort study in middle-aged and older
men from Eastern Finland, we showed that higher cholesterol or
egg intake was not associated with higher risk of incident de-
mentia. Instead, we showed that higher egg intake was associated
with better performance in 2 cognitive tests (i.e., Trail Making
Test and Verbal Fluency Test) that assessed frontal lobe and
executive functioning.
The evidence about the association between dietary choles-
terol intake and risk of dementia is controversial. In animal
studies in mice, rats, and rabbits, the association between high
cholesterol intake and AD-type pathologies has been shown
systematically (14–18). However, the association has not been
shown in humans (19, 20). As regards the association between
dietary cholesterol and lower cognitive performance, $3 studies
have been published of which 2 studies showed an association
(43, 44) and 1 study did not (45). In our study, higher intake of
dietary cholesterol had, in general, no association with cognitive
performance or risk of incident dementia.
It is not clear why the associations between dietary cholesterol
and dementia seem incoherent between animal and human
studies. One explanation could be the different lipoprotein me-
tabolism of rats, mice, rabbits, and humans (46), and thus, results
obtained from animal studies are possibly not directly applicable
to humans. Although the lipid metabolism of rabbits is more
comparable to that of humans than is the metabolism of rodents,
there are still some differences. For instance, rabbits are sensitive

 to cholesterol, and the consumption of a long-lasting diet that
contained .1% cholesterol resulted in abnormally high cho-
lesterol concentrations in plasma, which have not been shown in
humans (46). Another explanation could be that dietary cho-
lesterol does have an effect on the human brain, but the patho-
logic changes are so minor that they cannot be seen on MRI or
on clinical status. This possibility could explain why there
have been some indications of the associations between dietary
cholesterol and lower cognitive performance (43, 44). However,
this connection cannot be applied to eggs as such.
To the best of our knowledge, there has been no previous
evidence concerning the impact of egg intake on the risk of
dementia. However, a few studies have investigated the associ-
ation between egg intake and mild cognitive impairment and have
shown either no association (47) or that eggs have had a beneficial
association (21, 22), as was the case in our study. Nevertheless, all
of these previous publications covered a more limited number of
tests than in our study.
Eggs are a major source of dietary cholesterol because 1 egg
contains w200 mg cholesterol. However, the effects of eggs on
health are difficult to determine only by their cholesterol con-
tent. Dietary cholesterol has only a minor effect on plasma
cholesterol concentration in the majority of people (9), and eggs
are a source of many other nutrients and bioactive compounds
than just cholesterol (48). Eggs contain high-quality protein,
unsaturated fatty acids, chelators, and all necessary minerals and
vitamins, with the exception of vitamin C. The nutrient-dense
form of eggs may be a good source of energy for individuals
who are at risk of malnutrition, such as the elderly (49). The
bioactive compounds, such as lutein, zeaxanthin, (50) and cho-
line (51), may have some beneficial effects on inflammation (52)
and intestinal cholesterol absorption (53). High intake of choline
has also been associated with fewer errors in a test that measured
cognitive capacity (21), and in the current study population,
eggs have been associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes
(54). Overall, egg intake does not appear to be associated with
elevated risk of CVD (8, 10, 11) or mortality (11) in general
populations. The results have been similar even in hyper-
responders to dietary cholesterol (i.e., in APO-E4 carriers) (13).
Our results indicate that a moderate intake of #1 egg/d does not
seem to increase the risk of cognitive decline either.
In some studies, egg intake has been associated with unhealthy
lifestyle factors such as smoking, high intake of processed red
meat, and low intake of vegetables (55, 56), which may have
influenced the conclusions that were made on the health effects of
eggs. In our study population, such associations were not ob-
served (Table 1). On the contrary, higher intake of eggs was
associated with some favorable health factors, such as lower
serum CRP, and a lower likelihood to have hypertension.
A strength of our study is the detailed information about dietary
intakes, which were assessed with the use of a 4-d food record and
included data about eggs in mixed dishes and recipes. We also had
detailed information about incident dementia diagnoses. The other
strengths are the population-based recruitment, extensive database
of potential confounders, and virtually no loss to follow-up in the
analyses with incident dementia.
A potential limitation of the study is the lack of data on the
Apo-E4 phenotype for all participants. We also had information
on the performance in the cognitive tests for only a small pro-
portion of the participants, which limited the generalizability of
the findings to the whole study population. The number of
subjects was further reduced in the sensitivity analyses after the
exclusion of men with coronary artery disease at baseline, which
may at least partly explain the attenuated associations between
egg intake and the performance on the Trail Making Test and
Verbal Fluency Test in those analyses. Dietary habits were
assessed only at baseline, which may have attenuated the asso-
ciations with incident dementia during the long follow-up. Be-
cause the majority of dementia events occurred toward the end of
the follow-up as the men were getting older, we were unable to
investigate the associations with a shorter follow-up without
losing a significant number of events. For example, only 11 events
occurred during the first 10 y of follow-up. However, cholesterol
or egg intake was not associated with worse performance in the
cognitive tests at the 4-y examinations either, which supports the
lack of an association with incident events. Scores on the cog-
nitive performance tests at the 4-y examinations were relatively
good, which indicated the good cognitive ability of participants at
baseline. Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to study
populations who already exhibit cognitive declines.
In conclusion, there are no indications of a relation of dietary
cholesterol intake or moderate egg consumption with an in-
creased risk of incident dementia in the current study. Instead, our
results suggest that moderate egg intake may have a positive
association with certain areas of cognitive performance. More
studies in diverse populations are needed to elucidate the impact
of egg and cholesterol intakes on cognitive decline.
