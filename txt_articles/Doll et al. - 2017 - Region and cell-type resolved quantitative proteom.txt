The heart is a central human organ and its diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide,
but an in-depth knowledge of the identity and quantity of its constituent proteins is still
lacking. Here, we determine the healthy human heart proteome by measuring 16 anatomical
regions and three major cardiac cell types by high-resolution mass spectrometry-based
proteomics. From low microgram sample amounts, we quantify over 10,700 proteins in this
high dynamic range tissue. We combine copy numbers per cell with protein organellar
assignments to build a model of the heart proteome at the subcellular level. Analysis of
cardiac fibroblasts identifies cellular receptors as potential cell surface markers. Application
of our heart map to atrial fibrillation reveals individually distinct mitochondrial dysfunctions.
The heart map is available at maxqb.biochem.mpg.de as a resource for future analyses of
normal heart function and disease.

he human heart beats more than two billion times in an
average life span and each contraction is precisely con-
trolled by an intricate interplay between electrical signals
and mechanical forces. At the anatomical level, it is composed of
four cavities, four valves, large arteries, and veins, which act in
concert to achieve proper filling, ejection, contraction, and overall
pump function. The heart’s own blood supply is ensured by two
coronary arteries. The human heart is composed of four major
cell types—cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), cardiomyocytes, smooth
muscle cells (SMCs), and endothelial cells (ECs)1. Their pro-
portion with respect to number and volume, however, remains
controversial. CFs are mesenchymal cells, which produce the
extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold of the heart and are thought
to constitute more than half of all heart cells2. Cardiomyocytes
are estimated to provide about 30% of the total cell number but
account for over 70% of the total cardiac mass because of their
large volume. In contrast, SMCs, which support the vascular
system, and ECs, which form the interior lining of the heart,
blood vessels, and cardiac valves, are generally believed to be
much less abundant. However, these estimates have been chal-
lenged and a recent report claims that ECs are the largest cellular
population within the heart3.
In common with other muscle tissues, the heart is dominated
by a small number of proteins involved in the contractile appa-
ratus. It employs tissue-specific isoforms such as cardiac tropo-
nins, which are used in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction.
From a physiological and pathophysiological perspective, it would
be desirable to gain deeper insights into the molecular char-
acteristics of the heart at the spatial and cellular levels. In parti-
cular, characterization of the healthy state of the human heart
would be an important starting point to investigate heart disease,
which—despite major progress remains the leading cause of death
in developed countries and is rapidly increasing in developing
ones4.
Relatively little is known about the protein composition of the
different regions and cell types of the heart. Previous studies have
focused on defining differences between specific regions of the
heart, or single-diseased heart compartments5, or from nonhu-
man, or subcellular material6,7. Phosphoproteomic studies have
also been applied for the analysis of mammalian hearts8,9.
Moreover, other studies use transcriptomic approaches10–12,
which is an imperfect proxy for protein levels and their dynamics.
However, proteins are the driving forces of the cellular machinery
and they are involved in the control of virtually all physiologic

 events. The high dynamic range of the muscle proteome presents
a formidable challenge to the comprehensive analysis of the heart
at the level of expressed proteins. This is because very abundant
proteins make it difficult to detect low abundant regulatory
proteins in the same sample. The majority of studies only iden-
tified a few thousand proteins, and there is a paucity of studies of
the human, nondiseased heart, because of the difficulty in
obtaining the relevant tissue.
A global protein expression “footprint” of the healthy heart can
be used as a reference library to compare against footprints of
malfunctioning hearts in the search for biomarkers, therapeutic
targets, or disease signatures. Recent advances in MS-based pro-
teomics technology now allow the identification of very deep
proteomes13,14. Our group has already established proteomics
maps of the mouse liver and brain15,16 and analyzed skeletal
muscle in considerable depth and sensitivity17,18. Here, we set out
to generate a spatial and cell-type-resolved proteomic map of the
healthy human heart. To this end, we measured 16 regions of
three human hearts, as well as primary cell types. We employed
high-sensitivity sample preparation, peptide fractionation, and an
advanced label-free LC–MS workflow to quantify a total of more
than 11,000 proteins. Our results establish proteomic differences
between heart regions, suggest functional differences, and pin-
point potential cell-type markers. To illustrate the usefulness of
the heart proteomic map, we apply it to define molecular changes
in patients suffering from atrial fibrillation (AFib).
Results
Establishing a proteomic map of the human heart. Three adult
hearts were obtained from male trauma victims aged 21–47 years
with no apparent adverse heart condition (Supplementary
Table 1). We selected a total of 16 anatomically defined regions
from each heart for MS analysis (Fig. 1a, b): the atrial and ven-
tricular septa (SepA and SepV) separating the atria and ventricles,
respectively; the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV)
connected via the tricuspid valve (TV); the left atrium (LA) and
left ventricle (LV) linked via the mitral valve (MV); the right and
left ventricles connected to the pulmonary artery (PA) and aorta
(Ao) via the pulmonary and aortic valves (PV and AV); the
inferior vena cava (IVC) collecting deoxygenated blood; the
pulmonary vein (PVe) carrying oxygenated blood; and the main
right and left coronary arteries (RCA and LCA) supplying the
heart with oxygen-rich blood. In addition, we isolated CFs, ECs,

 and SMCs from patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery
(Fig. 1c).
After tissue homogenization in liquid nitrogen, we performed
all sample preparation using the “in-StageTip (iST) method” (see
“Methods”
section),
reducing
sample
contamination,
loss,
preparation time, and increasing quantification accuracy19. The
recently described “loss-less” nano-fractionator enabled efficient
fractionation of a total of only 30 µg of peptides into eight
fractions, of which a third of each fraction was loaded in the
subsequent LC–MS step20. The resulting 400 samples were
analyzed
with a state-of-the-art
label-free workflow on a
quadrupole– Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Fig. 1a).
Analysis in the MaxQuant environment using a false-discovery
rate (FDR) of less than 1% at the peptide and protein levels21,
identified a total of 181,814 sequence-unique peptides. These
assembled into 11,236 protein groups. Many high-abundance
proteins had very high sequence coverage—such as 100% for
myosin regulatory light chain 2 (MYL7)—whereas median
coverage of all proteins was ~38%. The MaxLFQ algorithm22
quantified 11,163 proteins, 10,751 in the 16 heart regions, and
10,447 in the noncardiomyocyte cell types, including AFs
(Fig. 1d). Proteomic depth was high in all regions, including
the four cardiac valves, in which we identified a mean of about
7800 proteins despite the fact that it mainly consists of ECM. To
put this number in perspective, reanalysis of the “human draft
proteome” heart data23 with the settings used here revealed that
our study identified more than three times as many proteins,
most of which were of low abundance (Supplementary Fig. 1). For
further analysis, we only considered a subset of 8908 proteins
with quantitative values in all biological triplicates of at least one
heart region.
Signal intensities for the quantified proteins spanned more
than six orders of magnitude, while only six proteins—myosin 7
(MYH7), titin (TTN), cardiac muscle-specific actin (ACTC1),
alpha-actinin-2 (ACTN2), and hemoglobin (HBA1 and HBB)
represented 25% of the total protein molecules in cavities, with
similar values in vessels and valves (Supplementary Fig. 2a–f). A
large amount of hemoglobin remained, despite extensive washing

 of the samples with PBS, since hearts of trauma victims cannot be
perfused. Due to efficient peptide fractionation, our measurement
covered regulatory proteins such as transcription factors GATA4,
GATA6, TBX20, TBX3, and TBX5 controlling cardiac-specific
gene expression (Supplementary Fig. 3).
To assess quantitative reproducibility, we analyzed several
samples in technical triplicates. Pearson correlation coefficients
(0.97–0.99) were on par with, or exceeded the values previously
achieved in cell line systems24 (Supplementary Fig. 4). Likewise,
we observed high correlation values between biological replicates;
ranging from 0.83 (PVe) to 0.95 (LA) (Supplementary Fig. 5). As
these values incorporate any differences due to postmortem
sample treatment, we conclude that our results from three
individuals can likely be generalized to the adult male population
at large. Raw data and MaxQuant results are provided online and
the human cardiac proteome resource is available in our online
database MaxQB25 (see below).
Comparative analysis between anatomical areas of the heart.
For an overall assessment of proteomics similarities and differ-
ences of the 16 heart regions, we employed principal component
analysis (PCA). Cavities, vessels, and valves clearly clustered
separately with the samples from different individuals tightly
grouped together (Fig. 2a). The only exception was the PVe from
patient 1 and 2, which clustered closer to the atrium than the
other vessels. This is readily explained by the difficulty of
resecting PVe without contamination from LA; thus, PVe samples
were excluded from the subsequent analyses.
The segregation of the three groups was mainly driven by
MYL7, MYL5, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 7A1 (COX7A1),
sarcalumenin (SRL) and TTN (highlighted in red, driving
segregation of the cavities), and collagen proteins, such as
COL4A2, COL14A1, and integrins, including ITGA7, ITGA8,
and ITGB1 (highlighted in blue, segregating vessels), as well as
biglycan (BGN), COL11A1, COL11A2, and COL6A6 (highlighted
in purple, segregating valves) (Fig. 2b). As these proteins reflect
known biological differences between the cardiac cavities and the
vessels and valves that are rich in ECM components, they serve as
positive controls of our proteomic analysis. Furthermore, the
PCA analysis highlighted several interesting candidates, such as
cartilage intermediate layer protein 2 (CILP2) and MXRA5
(valves), nephronectin (NPNT), a functional ligand of ITGA8 and
ITGB1 (vessels), and uncharacterized proteins such as C16orf96
(cavities).
Each of the three main clusters exhibited further subgroupings.
Heart cavities were divided into atrial (RA, LA, and SepA) and
ventricular (RV, LV, and SepV) parts and within them atrial and
ventricular septa were separated from atria and ventricles,
respectively. Furthermore, there was a moderate but clear
distinction of the left and right side of the heart (Fig. 2c). The
vessel group subdivided into large arteries (Ao and PA) and large
veins (IVC) (Fig. 2d). Within the arteries, the RCA and LCA
formed a subcluster, demonstrating differences between coronary
and large arteries at the proteomic level. Finally, both atrioven-
tricular valves (MV and TV) clustered together, whereas
semilunar valves (AV and PV) formed a separate group (Fig. 2e).
The main drivers of the PCA separation are highlighted in
Supplementary Fig. 6.
For a functional view of the proteomic differences in the
human heart, we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering
of the 6807 proteins with statistically different expression across
the heart regions (FDR < 0.05) (Supplementary Data 1). This
again clustered individuals in all but one case (RV of one
individual), followed by cavities, vessels, and valves with their
subdivisions (Fig. 3a). The heat map shows one major cluster of
highly and coexpressed proteins for each of the three anatomical
areas. Gene ontology and GSEA26 revealed that proteins in cluster
A (high expression in the cavities) were enriched (p < 10−12)
in terms of cardiac muscle contraction, Z disc, and sarcomere
organization
compared
to
clusters
B
and
C
(high
expression in the vessels and valves, respectively). The terms
mitochondria and respiratory electron transport chain were also
enriched (p < 10−55) in this cluster, concordant with the large
number of mitochondria to ensure sufficient amounts of ATP for
continuous muscle contraction (Supplementary Data 2). Thus,
our proteomic data provide a global protein expression basis for
the functional specialization of cardiac muscle tissue.
To provide insights into the organelle sizes in the heart
proteome at a quantitative level, we used the proteomic ruler
approach to estimate copy numbers per cell27 together with

We
calculated
an
approximate total protein content of 1 ng per diploid nucleus
and found that a heart cavity muscle cell has an approximate
volume of 5 pL per nucleus (note that about 30% of all
cardiomyocytes have two or more nuclei2). These values are
roughly double that of mouse heart muscle cells30. Estimated
protein copy numbers per diploid nucleus and protein concen-
tration31 across our samples ranged from ~10 to 109 and <0.1 nM
to 200 µM, respectively (Supplementary Data 3). We found that
mitochondria constituted 21% of protein mass in the cavities
(Fig. 3b, “Methods” section, and Supplementary Data 3). This
compares to 7% of mitochondrial protein mass in HeLa cells28
and 3% in valves and vessels, demonstrating the immense aerobic
respiration in cardiac muscle cells localized in the atrial and
ventricular part of the heart at a quantitative level.
To further mine our quantitative and in-depth proteome
resource, we used volcano plots32 to compare expression
differences within the three anatomical areas of the heart. We
specifically focused on proteins that were in the top 75% in
abundance and only identified in one of the two regions that we
compared (Supplementary Data 4).
The atrial vs. ventricular proteome. Although they are both
heart muscles, the main role of atria is to collect and transfer
pulmonary and systemic blood, whereas ventricles need to pump
the blood throughout the entire body. Consistent with these
different functions, we found drastic differences in their pro-
teomes, with 1220 (13.7%) proteins showing significantly higher
expression in the atria and 409 (4.6%) displaying higher expres-
sion in the ventricles (Fig. 4a). As expected, mitochondrial pro-
teins were more abundant in ventricles (p < 10−150 by GSEA
analysis, Supplementary Data 5). Cardiomyocytes use fatty acids
as their main energy source and ventricular myocytes have higher
energy demands due to the greater force of contraction.
Accordingly, lipid metabolic processes were overrepresented in
the ventricular region (p 7 × 10−26), exemplified by the ~tenfold
increased expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Likewise, it was
enriched in muscle contraction (p 9 × 10−27), due to increased
cardiomyocyte
size,
as
estimated
by
the
proteomic
ruler
(“Methods” section). The known markers for ventricles vs. atria,
such as MYL2, MYL3, and LPL were clearly recovered as such,
and our data set contains many additional ones, including the
lysine methyltransferase SMYD2, which is thought to have a role
in myocyte function33. Several interesting candidates were only
identified in the ventricles but not in the atria, such as the
probable histone demethylase JMJD1C, the ubiquitin ligase
TRIM38, the tumor suppressor RASSF8, and the uncharacterized
KIAA1324L protein. These proteins have not been associated
with ventricular functions before and suggest starting points for
exploring their role in heart physiology. Proteins previously
reported as atrium specific34–36, including myosin 6 (MYH6),
peptidyl-glycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), and
natriuretic peptides A (NPPA) displayed ten to several hundred-
fold higher abundance in the atrium. Interestingly, these proteins
are only highly expressed in the ventricular regions under
pathological conditions—for example, cardiac hypertrophy leads
to elevated PAM levels in ventricles37. We found potassium ion
channels predominantly in the atrial part, such as KCNK1, which
induces background currents38, and calcium-dependent ion
channels, including CACNA2D2 and 3 (>fourfold), as well as gap
junction GJA5 (>ninefold), reflecting the presence of the sinus
and AV node, which generate the electrical impulse for heart
contraction. Others, such as CACNA1C, which play an important
role in excitation–contraction coupling in the heart, were equally
expressed in the atria and ventricles (see also Supplementary
Fig. 7).
The
high
protein
sequence
coverage
encouraged
us
to
investigate isoform-specific expression patterns of sarcomeric
proteins (Supplementary Data 6). These isoforms are of particular
importance because their altered expression has been associated
with diverse cardiac dysfunctions39 and because troponins are
routinely used biomarkers for myocardial infarction40. The
myosin isoform families MYH6, MYH7, MYL2-7, and MYL8
localized highly specifically to atria or ventricles, confirming the
regional specificity of our data set despite high sequence identity,
for instance, over 80% between MYHs41.
Myocardial infarction remains one of the largest causes of
death and although rapid ELISA tests against cardiac troponins
TNNT2 and TNNI3 play a crucial role, further improvements in
diagnosis would be of great clinical benefit42,43. Here, we found
that TNNT2 was more abundant (>twofold) than TNNI3 in all
cavities and that their expression largely correlated across regions
(Pearson correlation: 0.99). Interestingly, the cardiac isoform
myosin-binding protein C3 (MYBPC3), which participates in
stabilizing sarcomere structures, displayed a strikingly similar
protein expression profile to cardiac troponins and was similarly
abundant to TNNT2 (about 1.5-fold higher abundant) (Supple-
mentary Fig. 8). Moreover, it can be detected by antibody- and
MS-based
approaches
in
human
plasma
after
myocardial
injury44,45, showing that it can be used as an useful additional
parameter to monitor myocardial infarct.
Finally, while the RV and LV did not show any significantly
altered protein expression, the protein myotilin, which stabilizes
thin filaments during muscle contraction was much more
abundant in LA compared to RA (>100-fold; Supplementary
Fig. 9).
Large vs. small arteries proteomes. Coronary arteries are rela-
tively small as they supply the heart itself with blood; however,
their malfunction is responsible for the high prevalence of cor-
onary artery diseases (CADs), affecting more than 16 million
individuals in the United States alone46. Overall, 1233 (13.8%) of
quantified proteins were significantly more abundant in coronary
arteries (RCA and LCA) and 631 (7.1%) in large arteries (Ao and
PA) (Fig. 4b). Proteins involved in mitochondrial functions,
collagen proteins, and integrins, such as COL15A1 and ITGB4
were highly enriched in the coronary vs. large arteries. Fibro-
nectin (FN1) showed a 12-fold increase and has been previously
associated with CADs47, although it would need to be investi-
gated whether or not it is a specific marker for CAD patients.
Arylsulfatase E (ARSE) is a constituent of artery walls where it
regulates the composition of cartilage, and we found it to be >20-
fold more abundant in coronary arteries.
Large arteries showed significant (p < 3 × 10−42) enrichment
for cytoskeleton proteins and proteins involved in cell junction,
consistent with the higher structural demands on them. For
instance, fibulin 5 (FBLN5) was six- to tenfold higher expressed
in PA and Ao than the other heart compartments (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 10). It is required to form the elastic lamina, has a
protective role against vascular injury, and its downregulation has
been associated with aortic aneurysm48. Interestingly, fibroblast
growth factor 2 (FGF2) and ras-related protein (RAP1A),
described as a key regulator of FGF2-induced angiogenesis49,
were three- to sixfold more abundant in the large arteries. As we
had not identified FGF2 in a deep plasma proteome previously50,
it is unlikely to derive from blood remnants and may instead
represent an ECM-bound form51. A total of 92 medium- to high-
abundance proteins were exclusively quantified in the large
arteries (Supplementary Data 4). This included the key focal

 adhesion protein SORBS1, COL26A1, and MYLK and MYH11,
which are both involved in smooth muscle contraction, reflecting
the higher proportion of SMCs in the large arteries’ wall
compared to coronary arteries.
The atrioventricular vs. semilunar valves proteome. The atrio-
ventricular valves separating atria from ventricles (TV and MV)
are morphologically quite different from the semilunar valves
(AV and PV) preventing backflow of blood from aorta or pul-
monary artery to ventricles. We found that only 497 (5.6%)
proteins were significantly more abundant in the atrioventricular
valves and 242 (2.7%) were more abundant in the semilunar
valves (Fig. 4c). Valves are composed of highly organized ECM
proteins and changes in its composition and their possible release
are expected during valve deterioration, leading to dysfunction
and failing heart valves52–54. Although the overall changes were
limited, we found that among the ECM proteins, plectin isoform
3 and GFAP were highly expressed in the semilunar valves,
whereas peripheral plasma membrane CASK, collagen enzyme
P4HA1, integrin ITGA8, and neurofibromin (NF1) were sig-
nificantly higher in atrioventricular valves.
Cell-type-resolved proteome of the human heart. Our region-
resolved proteome achieved great depths, but as we used homo-
genized tissue, we do not have cell-type-specific information
about the origin of the proteins. To address this, we isolated CFs,
ECs, and SMCs from tissue samples harvested during cardiac
surgery (Supplementary Table 2, “Methods” section). AFs were
included to help in defining the CF-specific proteome. Cardio-
myocytes were not investigated because of the impossibility to
culture these cells from surgical biopsies. We achieved highly
purified cell populations with values for CFs, AFs, ECs, and SMCs
of 96%, 97%, 96%, and 92%, respectively (Supplementary
Fig. 11a–d). Of a total of 11,236 different proteins, 7965 were
identified in all four cell types, indicating that the majority of the
cardiac cell proteome is expressed in its major cell types (Fig. 5a).
We found high correlation (0.92) in protein expression between
the fibroblast cell types (CF and AF), whereas SMC and EC were
somewhat less related (0.81) and this is also reflected in the PCA
(Supplementary Fig. 12 and Fig. 5b). On average, the 40 most
abundant proteins accounted for 25% of the total protein mass in
all four cell types (Fig. 5c). Consistent with the mesodermal origin
of these cell types, vimentin (VIM) was the most abundant pro-
tein, accounting for 3% of the total protein mass. In conjunction
with LARP6, VIM stabilizes type I collagen mRNAs, leading to
upregulation of the collagens COL1A1 and COL1A255. We found
the collagens in the top quartile (Q1) of expression in CFs, AFs,
and SMCs, whereas they were among the least abundant proteins
(Q4) in ECs. Cell-type-enriched proteins—those with at least
twofold higher expression in one of the cell types compared to all
others—are listed in Supplementary Data 7.
CF-enriched cell surface markers. Over the past decade, CFs
have been shown to hold great promise as a potential target
population for cardiac regenerative therapies1,56,57. Selection and
targeting of CFs, however, remains challenging and currently
relies on unspecific CF markers, including VIM, discoidin
domain-containing receptor 2 (DDR2), periostin (POSTN),
protein S100A4, ACTA2, platelet-derived growth factor receptors
PDGFRα and β, T-box transcription factor TBX18, and the THY1
membrane glycoprotein58. Among these, only PDGFRB, S100A4,
and ACTA2 showed at least twofold enrichment in CFs com-
pared to ECs and SMCs, whereas all other currently employed CF
markers were not enriched in CFs. Remarkably, compared to
another fibroblast cell type (AFs), none of these markers were
even twofold enriched. GATA4 and TBX20 have been reported as
specific CF markers59. GATA4 was indeed only identified and
quantified in CFs; however, TBX20 was fourfold more abundant
in SMCs compared to CFs.
Globally, 609 (5.8%) proteins were specifically enriched in CFs
compared to AFs, ECs, and SMCs. These encompassed 25 cell
membrane receptors (Supplementary Data 8). The presence of the
tyrosine kinase ROR1 in CFs has not been reported before but we
found it to be 200-fold more abundant than in the other cardiac
cell types. Activin receptor ACVR1 is required for normal heart
development60 and it was also one of the most highest expressed
proteins in CFs. Natriuretic peptide receptor NPR3 has a central
role in vasodilatation, is known to be present in CFs,61 and our
data showed sixfold higher expression in CFs. The drug target
hepatocyte growth factor receptor MET, was also increased in
CFs (fourfold higher than ECs and SMCs). BDKRB2, the receptor
for bradykinin plays a pivotal role in the cardiovascular system by
regulating blood pressure. Interestingly, we exclusively identified
it in fibroblasts, with 11-fold higher expression in CFs compared
to AFs. Likewise, protein levels of the cell membrane phosphatase
PTPRZ1 were more than 40-fold higher in CFs compared to all
other investigated cell types, a finding supported by qPCR.
Interestingly, the direction of expression changes was concordant
between the mRNA and protein levels. Importantly, however, for
this and six other genes, the fold-changes indicated by qPCR were
not predictive of the actual protein-level changes (Fig. 5d). Our
data provide a catalog of CF-enriched marker candidates that
hold promise for better definition and targeting of human CFs.
EC and SMC proteome. Two further major cell types of the
human heart include ECs, which form the inner lining of heart
blood vessels and SMCs, the major constituents of the heart
vasculature. ECs contain numerous storage granules filled with
von Willebrand factor (VWF), which is involved in hemostasis.
VWF was one of the most abundant proteins in ECs, whereas it
was among the least abundant in CFs, AFs, and SMCs (Fig. 5c).
The platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM1/CD31)
was among the most abundant (Q1) proteins in ECs. Further-
more, EC- specific proteins ESAM (>22-fold) and ESM1
(exclusively) were overrepresented. Proteins involved in blood
vessel morphogenesis such as the VEGF receptors FLT1, FLT4,
KDR, as well as EPHB4 and its ligand Ephrin B2 showed 3- to
250-fold higher expressions compared to the other cell types.
Comparing our data with single- cell transcriptomic data62
revealed that all genes identified as EC specific compared to CF
(except CAV2, which only displayed a moderate increase) also
showed at least several 10-fold upregulation in ECs at the pro-
teomic level (Supplementary Data 8).SMCs contain the same
muscle-contracting proteins as cardiac cells but do not have
troponin. The low levels of cardiac TNNT2 detected (>100-fold
less than in cavities), are likely due to the 8% impurity of isolated
SMCs. In place of troponins, caldesmon (CALD1), which was
among the highest abundant proteins in SMCs, blocks the
myosin-head binding site on actin filaments63. Proteins segre-
gating the SMC group (Fig. 5b, highlighted in pink) from EC, AF,
and CF included typical smooth muscle proteins such as
SMTNL2 and MYH11 of which we quantified three splice var-
iants and two were exclusively identified in SMCs. Our analysis
also opens up for the investigation of new epigenetic mechanisms,
for instance, based on the very significant enrichment for EZH2-
regulated proteins (p < 10−34).

 differences between healthy and diseased tissue. To this end, we
collected LA samples from three patients suffering from AFib
(Supplementary Table 3), the most common heart arrhythmia
and a major cause of mortality64. We applied a single-run
method, in which an in-depth measurement of the proteomic
system in question serves as a reference set of identified peptides
for deep and high-throughput single-run measurements65 to
assess the proteomic changes in AFib patients from minimal
material and in a timely manner. We found that combining the
iST sample preparation, our established healthy reference heart
“library,” and single-run, triplicate measurements, any cardiac
sample can be profiled in less than two days, of which only
300 min are MS-measuring time (Fig. 6a). In this way, we
quantified an average of 3681 proteins for the healthy LAs and
4147 proteins in the AFib group, with excellent average Pearson
correlations for technical and “biological replicates” of 0.97 and
0.93, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 13). In the AFib group
compared to healthy samples, 104 proteins were significantly
downregulated and 307 were upregulated (Fig. 6b and Supple-
mentary Data 9). Proteins with increased expression in AFib are
involved in ribonucleoprotein complexes and transcription. Some
ECM proteins, such as DSTN, ITGB2, ITGAM, and FLNB, were
significantly upregulated in the AFib group, whereas others,
including COL1A2, COL3A1, and ITGB1 were downregulated.
These results point to a reorganization of the ECM in AFib,
explaining previous observations at the level of expressed pro-
teins66. There is also evidence of significant contractile remo-
deling in AFib with several-fold lower expression of TNNT2,
HRC, MYH6, SCN5A, and SRL, suggesting disruption of the
cardiac tissue. Furthermore, MPRIP, a protein that has been
previously associated with an increased number of stress fibers
when downregulated67 showed 12-fold lower expression. The
most significantly downregulated proteins in the AFib group
(Fig. 6b and lower yellow box in Supplementary Fig. 14) were
enriched for “mitochondrion” (p < 10−100). This included the
most significantly downregulated protein (COX7B) and two other
key mitochondrial proteins—IMMT and TIMM8A, all of which
were >25-fold less abundant than in healthy tissue. Mitochon-
drial dysfunction has already been reported in AFib68–71; how-
ever, the broader molecular nature of their defects and whether
they are different between patients are not fully understood.
Interestingly, inspection of the hierarchical clustering plot within
the AFib group revealed distinct and nonoverlapping clusters of
up- and downregulated proteins for each of the three patients
(orange and green clusters, Supplementary Fig. 14), whereas
nondiseased biological controls showed similar expression to each
other. Although the number of AFib patients is much too small to
derive a general signature, our data clearly show that the mito-
chondrial defects reflected in the proteomes are very different
between individuals. These proteomic patterns point to a
potential molecular subclassification of AFib patients. These
observations, however, will require a more thorough analysis
including a larger patient cohort.
Discussion
Creating anatomical and cellular maps increases our under-
standing of human biology and diseases15,16,72. Here, we used
“loss-less” high-pH reversed-phase fractionation and high reso-
lution, quantitative MS to generate a heart region, and cell-type-
resolved human heart map. Starting from low microgram sample
amounts, we quantified over 11,000 proteins, representing by far
the deepest proteome of the healthy human heart, which is
available in the online database MaxQB25. The ability to work
with minimal starting material enables in-depth proteomics
analyses from heart biopsies that can be obtained during surgery.
Furthermore, our streamlined proteomics workflow enables the
profiling of any cardiac sample in less than two days, a realistic
time frame for future clinical application. At the anatomic level,
we found that the 16 heart regions clustered into the expected
three main areas (cavities, vessels, and valves). Binary comparison
of subgroups, such as the atria and ventricles, provides crucial
information to understand the basis for atrioventricular differ-
ences in healthy as well as diseased human hearts, a precondition
to identify more specific and reliable biomarkers. To complement
the region-resolved heat map, we also established a comprehen-
sive proteomic map of three noncardiomyocyte cell types. This
should be particularly useful in future studies to better define and
target the CF population. CFs are activated into myofibroblasts
after acute myocardial infarction, leading to increased ECM
production and wound healing by scar formation within the
infarction area. The direct reprogramming of resident CFs after
myocardial infarction into induced cardiomyocytes or cardiac

 progenitor cells is currently a promising strategy for cardiac
regeneration. Our quantitative proteomic data question the spe-
cificity of currently used CF markers while providing a promising
panel of enriched cell surface markers for therapy. There is a lack
of reliable biomarkers for aortic aneurysms (enlargement of the
Ao) or more importantly aortic dissection (tear in the wall of the
Ao). Currently, both diagnoses rely on clinical examinations and
laborious imaging techniques. Our deep quantitative proteome of
large arteries, in particular the Ao, could help in establishing a
healthy baseline in future studies aiming to define protein
expression indicative of these conditions. Likewise, our human
cardiac valve proteome can be used as a background for future
studies aiming to uncover biomarkers indicative of cardiac valve
deterioration. Finally, we show that patients suffering from AFib
present both common and distinct proteome profiles, potentially
pointing to individual-specific disease manifestation. While our
investigation is only a first step, it opens up as a yet-unexplored
molecular classification at the level of expressed proteins. Further
directions in human heart proteomics could include region- and
cell-type-specific mapping at higher resolution, investigation of
PTMs,
and
the combination
of
proteomics
with detailed
mechanistic investigations of disease etiology.
Methods
Tissue preparation. In total, 16 healthy heart regions from three adult male
individuals (Supplementary Table 1) were collected less than 72 h postmortem
during an autopsy after a court order. The hearts of the subjects did not present any
relevant injury or signs of cardiac malfunction and were therefore defined as
healthy. The 16 heart regions included four main vessels (aorta (Ao), pulmonary
artery (PA), vena cava inferior (IVC), and pulmonary vein (PVe)), four heart
cavities (right atrium (RA), left atrium (LA), right ventricle (RV), and left ventricle
(LV)), four heart valves (tricuspid valve (TV), pulmonary valve (PV), aortic valve
(AV), and mitral valve (MV)), the ventricular septum (SepV), the atrial septum
(SepA), the left coronary artery (LCA), and the right coronary artery (RCA) were
explanted by an official medicolegal expert. Samples were stored at −80 °C after
collection. The investigation was approved by the local ethical committee of the
Medical Faculty of the Technical University of Munich (project no. 247/16s). The
ethical committee explicitly approved the use of human samples in the context of
trauma.
Cell isolation. Atrial samples from patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery
were cut into 1–2-mm2 fragments and digested with 2 mg per ml of collagenase
type II (Life Technologies, Cat. No. 17101-015, Carlsbad, CA) in PBS (1 h, 37 °C).
After filtration (70-µm cell strainer (Greiner Bio-One, Cat. No. 542070, Frick-
enhausen, Germany) and red cell lysis (Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution, Miltenyi
Biotec, Cat. No. 130-094-183, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), the remaining cells
were resuspended in 1 ml of auto-running MACS buffer (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat. No.
130-090-221). After preseparation (30-µm filter, Miltenyi Biotec, Cat. No. 130-041-
407), CD31-positive endothelial cells (ECs) were isolated using the CD31
MicroBead Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat. No. 130-091-935) and the human FcR-
Blocking Regent (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat.No. 130-059-901) in the MACS system
(Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Isolated ECs were
cultured in Endothelial Cell Growth Medium 2 (PromoCell, Cat. No. C-22011,
Heidelberg, Germany) until confluence. Adipose fibroblasts (AF) were isolated
from subcutaneous fat tissue and cardiac fibroblasts (CF) were isolated from
atrial samples. Tissues were cut and digested using collagenase solution type II
(2.5 h, 37 °C), and resuspended in DMEM high glucose (Biochrom-Millipore, Cat.
No. FG 0435; Berlin, Germany) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Fisher
Scientific, Schwerte, Germany), penicillin (100 U per ml), streptomycin (100 µg per
ml), both from PanReacAppliChem (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany), and
sodium-pyruvate (1 mM, Gibco, Karlsbaden, CA) and grown to confluence.
Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were isolated from the arteria mammaria interna
(ITA). Vessels were cut longitudinally. With a scalpel, the tissue was cut into square
pieces. The pieces were put on BD PrimariaTM 6-well plates (Greiner Bio-One,
Frickenhausen, Germany) and dried (2–3 h, 37 °C, 5% CO2). Subsequently, SMC
growth medium 2 (PromoCell GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) was added. When the
first SMCs migrated from the tissue, the pieces were removed and cells were grown
to confluence. All biopsies from patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery were
transferred within 10 min from the operation room in PBS. To passage the ECs,
SMCs, and fibroblasts, cells were incubated with trypsin (Life Technologies) diluted
1 in 4 in PBS (5 min, 37 °C, 5% CO2). Trypsin solution was neutralized using 2
times of media. ECs and SMCs were frozen in liquid nitrogen in 10% DMSO (Roth,
Karlsruhe, Germany), 40% FCS, and 50% cell-type-specific medium. CFs and AFs
were frozen in liquid nitrogen using 10% DMSO and 10% FCS in fibroblast-specific
medium as described above. The generation of cell cultures from patient biopsies
was approved by the local ethical committee of the Medical Faculty of the Tech-
nical University of Munich (project no. 1588/06 (amendment) and 2919/10).
Flow cytometry-based quantification of the cell types. Frozen SMCs isolated
from the ITA (passage p2) and cultured as described above were thawed and used
for flow cytometry analysis. SMCs were fixed in 1% formaldehyde (20 min) and
blocked in PBS containing 10% FCS (v/v) and 0.05% sodium azide (w/v). The first
antibody anti-alpha smooth muscle actin (ab5694, Abcam, UK) was added at a
ratio of 1:20 in wash/permeabilization buffer (PBS containing 5% FCS (v/v),
saponin 0.5% (w/v), and sodium azide (0.05%, w/v)) for 30 min at 4 °C. The
secondary antibody goat-anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488® (ab150077, Abcam, UK) was
added at a ratio of 1:2000 in buffer containing saponin (30 min, ice, dark). ECs
from atrial biopsies were isolated and cultured as described above. After pre-
paration of a single-cell suspension, one sample of the total biopsy and the positive
and negative fraction obtained after MACS were analyzed. All cell fractions were
resuspended in ice-cold PBS/0.5% BSA/2 mM EDTA (FACS buffer) containing 5%
anti-human CD31 PE-Cy7 (25-0319, eBioscience, Frankfurt, Germany) and incu-
bated for 30 min in the dark. CFs and AFs were isolated as described before. Cells
were cultured on gelatin-coated plates and analyzed at passage 1 or 2. Cells were
detached using 0.25% trypsin (Life Technologies) diluted at a ratio of 1:4 in PBS.
Monoclonal anti-human CD90 PE-Cy5 (eBioscience, 15-0909), anti-human CD105
APC (eBioscience, 17-1057), and anti-human CD45 FITC (eBioscience, 11-9459)
antibodies were resuspended at a ratio of 1:20 in ice-cold FACS buffer and incu-
bated for 30 min on ice in the dark. After staining, all cells undergoing flow
cytometry analyses were resuspended in ice-cold PBS/0.5% BSA/4 mM EDTA and
kept in the dark on ice until flow cytometric analysis was performed with a BD
LSRFortessa (BD, San Jose, CA). Negative controls were unstained or stained with
the secondary antibody alone. Cytometry data were analyzed with the FlowJo
software version 7.6.5 (flowjo@treestar.com).
Immunocytochemistry. SMCs were fixed (4% PFA, 20 min) and permeabilized in
PBS-T (0.1% Triton-X-100 in PBS, 10 min). Unspecific binding was blocked with
5% normal goat serum (Abcam, ab7841, Cambridge, UK) in PBST for 30 min.
Polyclonal rabbit anti-alpha smooth muscle actin (Abcam, ab5694) was diluted at a
ratio of 1:20 in PBS-T and SMCs were incubated with the first antibody overnight
at 4 °C. The secondary antibody goat-anti- rabbit IgG (H&L) Alexa Fluor 555®
(Abcam, ab150078) was diluted at a ratio of 1:200 in PBS-T. Cells were incubated
in the dark for 60 min. ECs isolated from LA and the positive and the negative
fraction after MACS sort were stained for CD31. Cells were isolated and processed
using the MACS system as described above and plated on cover slides until con-
fluence. Cells were fixed using 4% PFA (10 min) and blocked (5% goat serum in
PBS). Polyclonal rabbit anti-CD31 (Abcam, ab28364) was diluted at a ratio of 1:25
and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibody goat-anti-rabbit IgG (H&L)
Alexa Fluor 555® (Abcam, ab150078) was diluted at a ratio of 1:500 and incubated
(60 min, dark). Both antibodies were diluted in PBS. CFs and AFs were fixed using
4% PFA/sucrose in PBS (15 min). For VIM staining, cells were permeabilized
(0.25% Triton-X-100 in PBS) and unspecific binding sites were blocked (5% goat
serum in PBS-T, 1 h). Polyclonal rabbit anti-VIM (Abcam, ab45939) was used as
cytoskeleton marker at 1 µg per ml of final concentration in PBS-T. For DDR2,
staining cells were washed with PBS after fixation and blocked with 5% goat-serum
in PBS. Polyclonal rabbit anti-DDR2 (LSBio, LS-C99151, Seattle, WA) was diluted
at a ratio of 1:20 in PBS. Both antibodies were incubated for 1 h. Secondary
antibody goat-anti-rabbit IgG (H&L) Alexa Fluor 555® (Abcam, ab150078) was
diluted at a ratio of 1:500 in either PBS-T or PBS and incubated for 1 h in the dark.
For immunocytochemistry, SMCs, ECs, CFs, and AFs were grown to approxi-
mately 80% confluence on 4-well chamber cover slides (Millizell EZ slides, Milli-
pore, Darmstadt, Germany). All incubations were performed at room temperature,
except overnight incubations. After the last wash, slides were air-dried, mounted in
Abcam-mounting medium containing DAPI (Abcam, ab104139), sealed with
coverslips, and evaluated under a fluorescent microscope (Axiovert 200 M, Zeiss,
D-73447 Oberkochen).
RT-qPCR analysis. Expression of CF-specific proteins was confirmed on tran-
scriptional level by RT-qPCR analysis. ECs, SMCs, CFs, and AFs (p0-4) were lysed
with RNA lysis buffer (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). Total RNA was purified using
the peqGOLD total RNA kit (Peqlab) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with M-
MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendation. Expression of ALDH1A2, PDFD, DAPK1,
CSRP2, DIAPH3, CES1, and PTPRZ1 was evaluated on a QuantStudio3 (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems) and the following conditions: activation of Taq DNA polymerase
(15 min at 95 °C) followed by 40 cycles with 15 s at 95 °C, 60 s at 60 °C. The
sequences of the used primers are noted in Supplementary Table 4. Quantification
was performed using the relative expression software tool REST©. Data were
normalized to β-actin.
Sample preparation for MS analysis. All 16 heart regions dissected from three
trauma victims were washed three times with cold PBS before being crushed in
liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Powdered samples were then resupended

 in 500 µl of SDC reduction and alkylation buffer and boiled for 10 min to denature
proteins19. Samples were further mixed (six times for 30 s and cooled on ice in-
between) using a FastPrep®-24 Instrument (MP Biomedicals). Protein concentra-
tion was measured using the Tryptophan assay and 300 µg were further processed
for overnight digestion by adding Lys-C and trypsin in a 1:50 ratio (µg of enzyme
to µg of protein) at 37 °C and 1700 rpm. On the following day, samples were
sonicated using a bioruptor (15 cycles of 30 s) and further digested for 3 h with Lys-
C and trypsin (1:100 ratio). Peptides were acidified to a final concentration of 0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) for SDB-RPS binding and 40 µg of peptides were loaded
on four 14-gauge Stage-Tip plugs. Peptides were washed first with isopropanol/1%
TFA (200 µl) and then 0.2% TFA (200 µl) using an in-house-made Stage-Tip
centrifuge at 2000×g. Peptides were eluted with 60 µl of elution buffer (80% acet-
onitrile/1% ammonia) into auto sampler vials and dried at 60 °C using a SpeedVac
centrifuge (Eppendorf, Concentrator plus). Peptides were resuspended in 2%
acetonitrile/0.1% TFA and sonicated (Branson Ultrasonics, Ultrasonics Cleaner
Model 2510) before peptide concentration estimation using the Nanodrop. About
30 µg of peptides of each sample were further fractionated into 54 fractions and
concatenated into 8 fractions by high-pH reversed-phase fractionation using the
recently described “loss-less” nano-fractionator20. CFs, AFs, ECs, and SMCs were
processed similarly to the heart tissue samples without liquid nitrogen crushing
and FastPrep®-24 Instrument.
Liquid chromatography–MS analysis. Nanoflow LC–MS/MS analysis of tryptic
peptides was conducted on a quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer73 (Q Exac-
tive HF, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) coupled to an EASYnLC
1200 ultra-high-pressure system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) via a nano-electrospray
ion source. About 1 µg of peptides were loaded on a 40-cm HPLC-column (75-μm
inner diameter; in-house packed using ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9-µm silica beads;
Dr Maisch GmbH, Germany). Peptides were separated using a linear gradient from
2 to 20% B in 55 min and stepped up to 40% in 40 min followed by a 5 min wash at
98% B at 350 nl per min where solvent A was 0.1% formic acid and 5% DMSO in
water and solvent B was 80% acetonitrile, 5% DMSO, and 0.1% formic acid in
water. The total duration of the run was 100 min. Column temperature was kept at
60 °C by a peltier element-containing, in-house-developed oven. The mass spec-
trometer was operated in “top-15” data-dependent mode, collecting MS spectra in
the Orbitrap mass analyzer (60,000 resolution, 300–1650 m/z range) with an
automatic gain control (AGC) target of 3E6 and a maximum ion injection time of
15 ms. The most intense ions from the full scan were isolated with an isolation
width of 1.5 m/z. Following higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with a
normalized collision energy (NCE) of 27%, MS/MS spectra were collected in the
Orbitrap (15,000 resolution) with an AGC target of 5E4 and a maximum ion
injection time of 25 ms. Precursor dynamic exclusion was enabled with a duration
of 30 s. For clinical AFib samples, a “top-5” data-dependent acquisition method as
described above was modified to increase the dynamic range on the MS1 level by
including three segmented MS scans (12 segments each; total AGC target 1E6),
covering a m/z range of 400–1200. MS1 resolution was set to 120,000 at m/z 200
throughout.
MS data analysis. Tandem mass spectra were searched against the 2015 Uniprot
human databases (UP000005640_9606 and UP000005640_9606_additional) using
MaxQuant21 version 1.5.5.6 with a 1% FDR at the peptide and protein level,
peptides with a minimum length of seven amino acids with carbamidomethylation
as a fixed modification, and N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidations as
variable modifications. Enzyme specificity was set as C-terminal to arginine and
lysine using trypsin as protease and a maximum of two missed cleavages were
allowed in the database search. The maximum mass tolerance for precursor and
fragment ions was 4.5 ppm and 20 ppm, respectively. If applicable, peptide iden-
tifications by MS/MS were transferred between runs to minimize missing values for
quantification with a 0.7-min window after retention time alignment. Label-free
quantification was performed with the MaxLFQ algorithm using a minimum ratio
count of 1. For clinical AFib samples, the identification transfer was restricted to
the healthy LA library only, and we set a minimum ratio count of 2 for label-free
quantification.
Statistical analysis. Statistical and bioinformatics analysis was performed with the
Perseus software32 (version 1.5.5.0), Microsoft Excel, and R statistical software.
Proteins that were identified in the decoy reverse database or only by site mod-
ification were not considered for data analysis. We also excluded potential con-
taminants. Data were further filtered to make sure that identified proteins showed
expression in all biological triplicates of at least one heart region and missing values
were imputed on the basis of normal distribution (down shift = 1.8, width = 0.15).
PCA analysis of the heart region and cell types relied on singular value decom-
position and the original feature (protein) space was orthogonally transformed into
a set of linearly uncorrelated variables (principal components). These account for
distinct types of variability in the data. For hierarchical clustering, LFQ intensities
were first z-scored and clustered using Euclidean as a distance measure for column
and row clustering. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using
gene set collections from the MSigDB26. Mean log2 ratios of biological triplicates
and the corresponding p values were visualized with volcano plots. We used t-test
for binary comparisons and SAM with s0 = 0.1 and FDR < 0.05 for the assessment
of t-test results in volcano plots32.
Copy number calculation and subcellular heart proteome model. Conversion of
LFQ intensities to copy number estimations was achieved using the proteomic
ruler27. The proteomic ruler plug-in v.0.1.6 was downloaded from the Perseus
plug-in store, for use with Perseus version 1.5.5.0. Protein intensities were filtered
for three valid values in at least one heart region. Proteins belonging to the GO
term “blood microparticle” were removed from the analysis (see Supplementary
Data 3 for a full list of removed proteins). Protein groups (proteins that can be
distinguished based on the available peptide information) were annotated with
amino acid sequence and tryptic peptide information for the leading protein ID,
using the .FASTA file used for processing in MaxQuant. Copy numbers per diploid
nucleus were estimated using the following settings: averaging mode—“All col-
umns separately,” molecular masses—“average molecular mass,” detectability
correction—“Number of theoretical peptides,” scaling mode—“Histone proteomic
ruler,” ploidy “2,” and total cellular protein concentration—“200 g per l.” To build a
subcellular model of the heart atlas proteome, subcellular localization predictions
from spatial proteomics data28,29 were matched to the protein groups using the
leading canonical protein ID. The median copy number of the three replicates was
multiplied by the protein molecular weight to calculate protein mass. The mass of
each protein was attributed to the nucleus, cytosol, or a specific organelle according
to its distribution in HeLa cells. Since many highly abundant heart-specific proteins
were not present in this spatial proteomics database, the top 100 proteins in each
heart region were completed for subcellular localization using annotation from
UniProt. These manually annotated protein masses were assigned entirely to the
respective organelle. This led to a median of 94% of total protein mass being
assigned to a specific location.

meXchange via the PRIDE database with the data set identifier PXD006675 and
