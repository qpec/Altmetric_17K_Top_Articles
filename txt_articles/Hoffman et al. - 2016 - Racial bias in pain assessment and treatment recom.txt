Black Americans are systematically undertreated for pain relative
to white Americans. We examine whether this racial bias is related
to false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and
whites (e.g., “black people’s skin is thicker than white people’s
skin”). Study 1 documented these beliefs among white laypersons
and revealed that participants who more strongly endorsed false
beliefs about biological differences reported lower pain ratings for a
black (vs. white) target. Study 2 extended these findings to the med-
ical context and found that half of a sample of white medical stu-
dents and residents endorsed these beliefs. Moreover, participants
who endorsed these beliefs rated the black (vs. white) patient’s pain
as lower and made less accurate treatment recommendations.
Participants who did not endorse these beliefs rated the black
(vs. white) patient’s pain as higher, but showed no bias in treat-
ment recommendations. These findings suggest that individuals
with at least some medical training hold and may use false beliefs
about biological differences between blacks and whites to inform
medical judgments, which may contribute to racial disparities in
pain assessment and treatment.
racial bias | pain perception | health care disparities | pain treatment
A
young man goes to the doctor complaining of severe pain in
his back. He expects and trusts that a medical expert, his
physician, will assess his pain and prescribe the appropriate
treatment to reduce his suffering. After all, a primary goal of
health care is to reduce pain and suffering. Whether he receives
the standard of care that he expects, however, is likely contingent
on his race/ethnicity. Prior research suggests that if he is black,
then his pain will likely be underestimated and undertreated
compared with if he is white (1–10). The present work investi-
gates one potential factor associated with this racial bias.
Specifically, in the present research, we provide evidence that
white laypeople and medical students and residents believe that
the black body is biologically different—and in many cases,
stronger—than the white body. Moreover, we provide evidence
that these beliefs are associated with racial bias in perceptions
of others’ pain, which in turn predict accuracy in pain treatment
recommendations. The current work, then, addresses an im-
portant social factor that may contribute to racial bias in health
and health care.
Extant research has shown that, relative to white patients,
black patients are less likely to be given pain medications and, if
given pain medications, they receive lower quantities (1–10). For
example, in a retrospective study, Todd et al. (10) found that
black patients were significantly less likely than white patients to
receive analgesics for extremity fractures in the emergency room
(57% vs. 74%), despite having similar self-reports of pain. This
disparity in pain treatment is true even among young children.
For instance, a study of nearly one million children diagnosed
with appendicitis revealed that, relative to white patients, black
patients were less likely to receive any pain medication for mod-
erate pain and were less likely to receive opioids—the appropriate
treatment—for severe pain (6).
These disparities in pain treatment could reflect an over-
prescription of medications for white patients, underprescription
of medications for black patients, or, more likely, both. Indeed,
there is evidence that overprescription is an issue, but there is
also clear evidence that the underprescription of pain medica-
tions for black patients is a real, documented phenomenon (1, 4).
For example, a study examining pain management among pa-
tients with metastatic or recurrent cancer found that only 35% of
racial minority patients received the appropriate prescriptions—
as established by the World Health Organization guidelines—
compared with 50% of nonminority patients (4).
Broadly speaking, there are two potential ways by which racial
disparities in pain management could arise. The first possibility is
that physicians recognize black patients’ pain, but do not to treat
it, perhaps due to concerns about noncompliance or access to
health care (7, 8). The second possibility is that physicians do not
recognize black patients’ pain in the first place, and thus cannot
treat it. In fact, recent work suggests that racial bias in pain
treatment may stem, in part, from racial bias in perceptions of
others’ pain. This research has shown that people assume a priori
that blacks feel less pain than do whites (11–17). In a study by
Staton et al. (14), for instance, patients were asked to report how
much pain they were experiencing, and physicians were asked to
rate how much pain they thought the patients were experiencing.
Physicians were more likely to underestimate the pain of black
patients (47%) relative to nonblack patients (33.5%). Of note,
Significance
The present work examines beliefs associated with racial bias in
pain management, a critical health care domain with well-docu-
mented racial disparities. Specifically, this work reveals that a
substantial number of white laypeople and medical students and
residents hold false beliefs about biological differences between
blacks and whites and demonstrates that these beliefs predict
racial bias in pain perception and treatment recommendation
accuracy. It also provides the first evidence that racial bias in pain
perception is associated with racial bias in pain treatment rec-
ommendations. Taken together, this work provides evidence that
false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and
whites continue to shape the way we perceive and treat black
people—they are associated with racial disparities in pain as-
sessment and treatment recommendations.

 this research has also shown that racial attitudes, measured both
implicitly and explicitly, do not predict racial bias in pain per-
ception or treatment (11, 15, 18), with the exception of one study
showing that implicit pro-white attitudes predicted physicians’
likelihood of recommending thrombolysis treatment (19). Racial
bias in perceptions of pain (and possibly treatment) does not
appear to be borne out of racist attitudes. In other words, it is
likely not the result of racist individuals acting in racist ways. To
date, then, it is unclear what beliefs account for disparities in
pain assessment and treatment. Here, we examine the extent to
which beliefs about biological differences between blacks and
whites (e.g., beliefs that blacks have thicker skin than do white
people or that black people’s blood coagulates more quickly than
white people’s blood) are associated with racial bias in pain
perception and treatment recommendations.
Beliefs that blacks and whites are fundamentally and biologically
different have been prevalent in various forms for centuries. In the
United States, these beliefs were championed by scientists, physi-
cians, and slave owners alike to justify slavery and the inhumane
treatment of black men and women in medical research (20–25). In
the 19th century, prominent physicians sought to establish the
“physical peculiarities” of blacks that could “serve to distinguish
him from the white man” (23). Such “peculiarities” in-
cluded thicker skulls, less sensitive nervous systems, and diseases
inherent in dark skin (20, 21, 23). Dr. Samuel Cartright, for in-
stance, wrote that blacks bore a “Negro disease [making them]
insensible to pain when subjected to punishment” (20). Other
physicians believed that blacks could tolerate surgical operations
with little, if any, pain at all (22, 25). Well into the 20th century,
researchers continued to experiment on black people based in
part on the assumption that the black body was more resistant to
pain and injury. The military covertly tested mustard gas and
other chemicals on black soldiers during World War II, and the
US Public Health Service, in collaboration with the Tuskegee
Institute, studied the progression of untreated syphilis in black
men from 1932 to 1972.
Today, many laypeople, scientists, and scholars continue to
believe that the black body is biologically and fundamentally
different from the white body and that race is a fixed marker of
group membership, rooted in biology (26–28). In fact, many people
insist that black people are better athletes—stronger, faster, and
more agile—as a result of natural selection and deliberate breeding
practices during slavery (29–33). Research suggests that people
even believe that black people are more likely than white people to
be capable of fantastical mental and physical feats, such as with-
standing extreme heat from burning coals (17). These biological
conceptions of race are only weakly if at all correlated with racial
attitudes (27, 34). They are nonetheless consequential. Research
has shown that biological conceptions and related beliefs are as-
sociated with greater acceptance of racial disparities (27) and even
racial bias in pain perception (17). Indeed, in one study, white
participants who believed black people can tolerate extreme heat
more than white people can, for example, were more likely to think
that black people feel less pain than do white people (17).
In the present work, we examine whether beliefs about bi-
ological differences are associated with racial bias in pain per-
ception and treatment recommendations. Specifically, we test
whether people—including people with some medical training—
believe that black people feel less pain than do white people, and
we test whether people with some medical training recommend
fewer or weaker pain medications to black vs. white patients. In
addition, the present work extends prior work in three important
ways. First, it documents whether people with some medical
training (medical students and residents who already treat pa-
tients) hold false beliefs about biological differences between
blacks and whites in contemporary times. Second, it tests
whether these beliefs predict racial bias in perceptions of others’
pain and racial bias in the accuracy of treatment recommendations
among a sample of white medical students and residents. Third, it
investigates whether racial bias in pain perception is related to
racial bias in pain management. We focus on white participants
given the historical context of black–white relations, particularly in
the medical context (20–25). Analyses for nonwhite participants
can be found in the SI Text for the interested reader.
In two studies, we asked people to make judgments about
another person’s pain. In study 1, we used a between-participants
design in which laypeople were randomly assigned to rate the
pain of either a black or a white target. In study 2, we used a
within-participants design in which medical students and resi-
dents provided pain ratings and treatment recommendations for
both a black and a white target. In addition to pain ratings, we
measured beliefs about biological differences between blacks and
whites using 15 items (e.g., black people’s skin is thicker than
white people’s skin; see SI Text for the full list of items). We
predicted that these beliefs would be associated with racial bias
in pain perception.
Study 1
In study 1, we first establish that individuals without medical
training endorse beliefs about biological differences between
blacks and whites and demonstrate that these beliefs are related
to racial bias in pain perception. We recruited 121 participants,
92 of whom met our a priori criteria (i.e., white, born in the
United States, native English speakers). Participants gave in-
formed consent in accordance with policies of the Institutional
Review Board (IRB) of the University of Virginia. Participants
reported the amount of pain they would feel across 18 scenarios
(e.g., “I slam my hand in a car door”; scale: 1 = not painful, 2 =
somewhat painful, 3 = moderately painful, 4 = extremely pain-
ful) and were then randomly assigned to rate the pain of a
gender-matched black or white target across the same scenarios.
Participants also rated the extent to which 15 biological dif-
ferences between blacks and whites are true or untrue on a six-
point scale (1 = definitely untrue, 2 = probably untrue, 3 =
possibly untrue, 4 = possibly true, 5 = probably true, 6 = defi-
nitely true; see Table 1 for a list of the items, and SI Text and
Table S1 for additional descriptive information for the measure).
Here, we report results using a composite averaging the false
items about biological differences between the black body and
the white body for each participant (α = 0.92). We provide
analyses using all items in Table S2.
We conducted all of the analyses using continuous measures of
false beliefs and pain ratings. On average, participants endorsed
23.82% (SD = 24.01) of the biological beliefs and 22.43% (SD =
22.93) of the false beliefs specifically. About 73% of the sample
endorsed at least one of the false items (i.e., indicated that an
item was possibly, probably, or definitely true; Table 1). We
regressed pain ratings on target race, false beliefs, and their in-
teraction, controlling for age, gender, and self-ratings of pain
(see Table S3 for the correlations between covariates and de-
pendent measures for both studies). Consistent with previous
work, results revealed a main effect of target race [β = −0.07, SE
= 0.03, F(1,85) = 5.50, P = 0.021, η2
p = 0.06, such that participants
reported lower pain ratings for the black vs. white target. This
effect was qualified by the predicted interaction between target
race and false beliefs [β = −0.07, SE = 0.03, F(1,85) = 4.36, P =
0.040, η2
p = 0.05; Fig. 1]. Simple slope analyses revealed that
participants who endorsed fewer false beliefs (−1 SD) did not
differ in their pain estimates for a black vs. a white target [β =
−0.01, SE = 0.05, F(1, 85) = 0.02, P > 0.250]. However, target
race did predict racial bias in pain ratings among participants
who endorsed more false beliefs (+1 SD) [β = −0.14, SE = 0.05,
F(1,85) = 9.78, P = 0.002, η2
p = 0.10], such that participants who
rated the black target reported lower pain estimates than did
participants who rated the white target. Interestingly, among this
sample, the bias emerged because participants high in false beliefs

 rated the pain of the black target lower and the pain of the white
target higher than did participants low in false beliefs. In other words,
relative to participants low in false beliefs, they seemed to assume
that the black body is stronger and that the white body is weaker.
Study 1 thus demonstrates that white adults without medical
training endorse at least some beliefs about biological differ-
ences between blacks and whites, many of which are false and
fantastical in nature (e.g., black people’s blood coagulates more
quickly than white people’s blood). Study 1 also demonstrates
that these beliefs are related to racial bias in pain perception
among a sample of white adults without medical training. Given
the well-documented, pervasive racial disparities in pain man-
agement, understanding who might contribute to this racial bias
and why is of paramount importance. Thus, we next examined
whether people with some degree of medical training also en-
dorse these beliefs, and if so, whether these beliefs are associated
with racial bias in pain perception and pain treatment recom-
mendations. Study 2 extends the findings of study 1 in at least
three important ways: (i) it examines racial bias in a relevant
context—medicine—using medical cases similar to those used in
medical training; (ii) it extends our investigation to a sample with
at least some medical training—medical students and residents;
and (iii) it considers a critical downstream outcome—racial bias
in pain treatment recommendations.
Study 2
We collected data from a total of 418 medical students and
residents. Two hundred twenty-two met the same a priori criteria
as in study 1 and completed the study (first years, n = 63; second
years, n = 72; third years, n = 59; residents, n = 28). Participants
gave informed consent in accordance with policies of the IRB of
the University of Virginia. After consenting, participants read
two mock medical cases about a black and a white patient and
made pain ratings (scale: 0 = no pain to 10 = worst possible pain)
and medication recommendations (dummy coded for accuracy: 1 =
accurate, 0 = inaccurate) for each.† They also completed the
same measure of beliefs about biological differences between
blacks and whites as in study 1. We again averaged the 11 items
that captured our variable of interest (α = 0.92) (see Table 1 and
Table S1 for descriptive information; analyses for the composite
with all items can be found in Table S4). On average, participants
endorsed 11.55% (SD = 17.38) of the false beliefs. About 50%
reported that at least one of the false belief items was possibly,
probably, or definitely true (Table 1). These percentages are
noticeably lower compared with those in study 1 (50% vs. 73%);
however, given this sample (medical students and residents), the
percentages for false beliefs are surprisingly high.

 First, we examined whether those who endorsed false beliefs
exhibited a racial bias in pain assessment. We modeled pain
ratings as a function of target race (as a repeated measure), false
beliefs (as a between-participants measure), and their interaction,
controlling for age, gender, and medical cohort.‡,§ Results
revealed only the predicted target race by false beliefs interaction
[F(1,211) = 9.56, P = 0.002, η2
G = 0.02; Fig. 2A]. To decompose this
interaction, we conducted simple slope analyses. We constructed a
difference score to reflect racial bias in pain perception, subtracting
black pain scores from white pain scores; greater, positive scores
indicate that a participant rated the white patient as feeling more
pain than the black patient. The simple slope analyses indicated
that participants who endorsed more false beliefs (+1 SD) rated the
black target as feeling less pain than the white target [β = 0.45, SE =
0.20, t(211) = 2.24, P = 0.026]. Conversely, participants who en-
dorsed fewer false beliefs (−1 SD) rated the black target as feeling
more pain than the white target [β = −0.48, SE = 0.20, t(211) =
−2.34, P = 0.020]. In other words, as in study 1, participants in study
2 who endorsed false beliefs about biological differences between
blacks and whites exhibited a racial bias in pain perception similar
to the bias shown in previous work (11–17). Unexpectedly, partic-
ipants who did not endorse such beliefs exhibited a bias in the
opposite direction.
We next modeled the accuracy of treatment recommendations
(coded as 1 = accurate, 0 = inaccurate) as a function of target race
(as a repeated measure), false beliefs (as a between-participants
measure), and their interaction, controlling for age, gender, and
medical cohort. Once again, we found only the predicted in-
teraction between target race and false beliefs [F(1,192) = 5.68, P =
0.018, η2
G = 0.01; Fig. 2B]. To decompose this interaction, we again
conducted simple slope analyses on the difference score in treat-
ment recommendation accuracy for the black vs. white target
(white accuracy minus black accuracy; greater, positive scores in-
dicate greater likelihood of recommending an accurate treatment
for a white vs. black target). These analyses indicated that partic-
ipants who endorsed more false beliefs (+1 SD) were less accurate
in their treatment recommendations for the black target compared
with the white target [β = 0.15, SE = 0.06, t(192) = 2.47, P = 0.014].
Conversely, participants who endorsed fewer false beliefs (−1 SD)
did not differ in their treatment recommendation accuracy [β =
−0.06, SE = 0.06, t(192) = −1.05, P > 0.250]. In other words,
participants who endorsed more false beliefs about biological
differences between blacks and whites showed a racial bias in
the accuracy of their treatment recommendations. Participants
who did not endorse such beliefs showed no bias in treatment
recommendation accuracy.
We also examined the relationship between racial bias in pain
perception and racial bias in treatment recommendation accuracy.
We correlated racial bias in pain perception (white pain minus
black pain) with racial bias in treatment recommendation accuracy
(accuracy for white patient minus accuracy for black patient),
covarying out age, gender, and medical cohort. This analysis
revealed a significant and sizable positive correlation, such that
greater racial bias in pain ratings was associated with greater racial
bias in the accuracy of treatment recommendations (r = 0.46, P <
0.0001). As predicted, racial bias in pain perception is related to
racial bias in the accuracy of treatment recommendations.
Last, we conducted a mediation analysis to test whether racial
bias in pain perception mediated the racial bias in treatment rec-
ommendation accuracy. When adding racial bias in pain assess-
ment (white pain minus black pain) to the model predicting racial
bias in treatment recommendation accuracy, false beliefs was no
longer a significant predictor [B = 0.05, SE = 0.04, F(1,191) = 1.22,
P > 0.250, η2
p = 0.01], whereas racial bias in pain perception
continued to predict racial bias in treatment recommendation
accuracy [B = 0.25, SE = 0.04, F (1,191) = 44.44, P < 0.0001, η2
p =
0.19], suggesting mediation.
Study 2 demonstrates that, similar to white laypersons in study
1, many white medical students and residents hold beliefs about
biological differences between blacks and whites, many of which
are false and fantastical in nature, and that these false beliefs are
related to racial bias in pain perception. Furthermore, study 2
also reveals that white medical students and residents who en-
dorsed false beliefs showed racial bias in the accuracy of their
pain treatment recommendations. Specifically, participants who

‡We present analyses using ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions. For the continuous
pain measure in study 2, we provide the mixed-effects model for comparison in Table S5.
For binary outcomes, such as treatment recommendation accuracy in study 2, logistic or
OLS regressions are appropriate and produce similar results. The OLS regression is our
preferred specification because interpretation requires weaker functional form assump-
tions than a linear dependent variable model (35) and provides unbiased, reliable esti-
mates of a variable’s average effect (36–40). However, because the outcome is binary,
some may prefer a logit and/or probit specification; we provide these specifications
in Table S6.
§This analysis also revealed that medical cohort was a significant predictor of both pain
ratings and treatment recommendation accuracy irrespective of patient race [F(1,211) =
38.79, P < 0.0001 and F(1,192) = 8.08, P = .005, respectively]. As participants progressed in
their training from first-year students through residents, they rated the targets as feeling
more pain and they were more accurate in their treatment recommendations. This
finding is interesting given the common perception that medical training hardens phy-
sicians to others’ pain and suffering (see ref. 41 for a review). At least in our sample,
people with more medical training were actually more, not less, sensitive to others’ pain.
Perhaps in the present sample, as more senior medical students and residents gained
“hands-on” experience on the medical wards and witnessed patients in pain, they per-
ceived greater pain for the scenarios we provided—both of which would be extremely
painful. In addition, it is perhaps not surprising that treatment recommendation accu-
racy was higher among more senior students, as additional training and experience
should yield greater accuracy. Medical cohort did not moderate the interaction between
target race and false beliefs for pain ratings or treatment recommendation accuracy
(Fs < 1). We thus included medical cohort as a covariate and not as a moderator of
the target race × false beliefs interaction term in all of our analyses.

 endorsed more of these beliefs reported that a black (vs. white)
target patient would feel less pain and they were less accurate
in their treatment recommendations for the black (vs. white)
patient. Although the effect sizes for these findings were not
large (η2
p = 0.03 and 0.04), the practical importance is significant:
those endorsing more false beliefs rated the pain of a black (vs.
white) patient half a scale point lower and were less accurate in
their treatment recommendations 15% of the time.
In contrast to white medical students and residents who en-
dorsed false beliefs, those who did not endorse (or endorsed
fewer) false beliefs reported that a white (vs. black) target pa-
tient would feel less pain. This opposite bias perhaps reflects
real-world differences, as previous work has shown that black
patients tend to report greater pain than do white patients (7, 24,
42). This opposite bias could also reflect participants’ attempt to
compensate for known racial disparities (see ref. 13 for a similar
explanation). Of note, these medical students and residents did
not exhibit a racial bias in treatment recommendations. In other
words, endorsing fewer false beliefs was associated with the
perception that whites feel less pain but not with insufficient
treatment recommendations for white patients. In contrast, en-
dorsing more false beliefs was associated with perceptions that
blacks feel less pain and a “commensurate” insufficient treat-
ment recommendation for black patients. It thus seems that ra-
cial bias in pain perception has pernicious consequences for
accuracy in treatment recommendations for black patients and
not for white patients.
Unexpectedly, shifts in racial bias as a function of false beliefs
stemmed from shifts in perceptions of the white target and not
the black target in study 2 (it stemmed from both shifts in per-
ceptions of the white target and black target in study 1). Although
perhaps counterintuitive, this pattern of results is consistent with
research on intergroup bias demonstrating that discrimination
often occurs due to ingroup favoritism rather than outgroup
hostility (43). In the present case, it is possible that shifts in
perceptions of the white target (and not the black target) reflect
this kind of bias; it is possible that these shifts reflect positive
(empathic) cognitions about white ingroup members rather than
negative (callous) cognitions about black outgroup members.
Limitations of the present work offer avenues for future re-
search. For practical reasons, we used survey methods to docu-
ment medical students’ and residents’ beliefs and racial bias.
Future work will need to test whether white and nonwhite
medical personnel in more advanced stages of their career also
hold beliefs about biological differences between blacks and
whites, and if so, whether these beliefs have consequences for
pain assessment and treatment in real medical contexts. Future
work may also delve into the nature of the racial bias: whether it
reflects ingroup favoritism rather than outgroup derogation. This
distinction may be useful for the development of interventions.
These limitations aside, studies 1 and 2 make at least three im-
portant contributions. First, they provide the first evidence that
racial bias in pain assessment is associated with racial bias in the
accuracy of pain treatment recommendations. Second, they re-
veal that a substantial number of white people—laypersons with no
medical training and medical students and residents—hold beliefs
about biological differences between blacks and whites, many of
which are false and even fantastical in nature. To our knowledge,
this is the first demonstration of medical personnel (students and
residents with at least some medical training) endorsing such be-
liefs in modern times. Third, the current studies demonstrate that
these beliefs are associated with racial bias in perceptions of others’
pain. Interestingly, in study 2, that bias seemed to result from shifts
in perceptions of the white target’s pain more so than perceptions
of the black target’s pain, suggesting that perceptions of whites’
frailty may shape racial bias in pain perception as much, if not
more, than perceptions of blacks’ strength.
Concluding Remarks
This last year marks the 30th anniversary of the landmark 1985
Report of the Secretary’s Task Force on Black and Minority Health—
more commonly known as the Heckler Report—the first compre-
hensive documentation of racial disparities in health by medical
experts. This report put a national spotlight on the pervasive racial
inequities in health and issued a resounding call to eliminate
health disparities. Although this call was met with a surge in re-
search efforts and substantial changes in medical programs, policy,
and legislation, the ultimate goal of eliminating racial disparities
remains elusive. Racial disparities in health and health care con-
tinue to be a problem in the United States, a point underscored
by the US Department of Health and Human Services’ “clarion
call to continue to take action toward ending health disparities”
(minorityhealth.hhs.gov/Blog/BlogPost.aspx?BlogID=68). The pre-
sent work sheds light on a heretofore unexplored source of racial
bias in pain assessment and treatment recommendations within a
relevant population (i.e., medical students and residents), in a
context where racial disparities are well documented (i.e., pain
management). It demonstrates that beliefs about biological dif-
ferences between blacks and whites—beliefs dating back to slav-
ery—are associated with the perception that black people feel less
pain than do white people and with inadequate treatment rec-
ommendations for black patients’ pain.
Materials and Methods
Study 1.
Participants. We recruited a sample of 121 adults on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk in
exchange for a small amount of money. As in previous work (15), we excluded
participants who were not born in the United States or native English speakers,
as well as participants who did not complete all of the relevant measures. We
also excluded all nonwhite participants, given the historical context of black–
white relations, particularly in the medical context (20–25). Our final sample
consisted of 92 participants (28% female; Mage = 26.70, SD = 8.76).
Procedure and materials. Participants gave informed consent in accordance with
policies of the IRB of the University of Virginia. After consenting, participants
were asked to provide their age and gender so the survey program could route
the participant to a gender-matched target. They then rated the amount of
physical pain they would feel across 18 scenarios and were randomly assigned to
rate the pain of a gender-matched black or white target across the same
18 scenarios (SI Text). Next, participants completed a 15-item measure of be-
liefs about biological differences between blacks and whites that are true or
untrue (see Table 1 and SI Text for a list of items and descriptive information).
To compose our conceptual variable of interest—false beliefs about biological
differences between blacks and whites—we created an average rating of 11 of
the items (α = 0.92; see bold items in Table 1 and see SI Text for additional
information on the measure). All analyses were conducted using continuous
measures of beliefs and pain ratings. After this measure, participants provided
demographic information, including their race/ethnicity, nationality, and pri-
mary language. SI Text provides additional information on materials, methods,
and results. Data and study materials are also available at https://osf.io/crxwa/.
Study 2.
Participants. We recruited cohorts of first-, second-, and third-year medical
students from a large public university, who completed the study online
during class sessions. We also recruited medical residents from multiple sites,
who completed the study online at their convenience. The sample included
418 participants (first years, n = 134; second years, n = 133; third years, n =
117; residents, n = 34); we had no set sample size, but rather collected data
from as many participants as we were able to obtain. As in previous work
(15), we excluded participants who were not native English speakers and/or
American because racial bias in pain perception is likely a cultural phe-
nomenon. Including these participants in our analyses does not change
the pattern of results. We again excluded nonwhite participants given the
historical context of black–white relations, particularly in the medical con-
text (20–25). The final sample consisted of 222 participants (first years, n =
63; second years, n = 72; third years, n = 59; residents, n = 28; 48% female;
Mage = 25.18, SD = 2.66). Some participants did not report age, gender, and/
or race/ethnicity and thus degrees of freedom vary across analyses.
Procedure and materials. Participants gave informed consent in accordance
with policies of the IRB of the University of Virginia. After consenting, par-
ticipants were asked to provide their age and gender so the survey program

 could route the participant to gender-matched targets. Participants then read
two mock medical cases about a black and a white patient. They were asked
to estimate the pain of each patient and to make a recommendation to treat
the patient’s pain. Next, participants were asked to provide demographic
information and to complete the same measure of beliefs about biological
differences between blacks and whites as in study 1, averaging the 11 false
items to create a measure of false beliefs (α = 0.92). Last, participants responded
to debriefing questions about the study and then were debriefed in person
(medical students) or read an electronic debriefing (medical residents). SI Text
provides additional information on materials, methods, and results. Data and
study materials are also available at https://osf.io/crxwa/.
