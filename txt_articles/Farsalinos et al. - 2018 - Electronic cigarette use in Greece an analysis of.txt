Abstract
Background: The purpose was to assess prevalence and correlates of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use in Greece in
2017.
Methods: A cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of 4058 adults living in Attica prefecture (35% of the Greek
adult population) was performed in May 2017 through telephone interviews. Prevalence and frequency of e-cigarette use
were assessed according to the smoking status, and logistic regression analysis was performed to identify correlates of use.
Results: Current smoking was reported by 32.6% of participants. Ever e-cigarette use was reported by 54.1% (51.4–56.8%)
of current smokers, 24.1% (21.7–26.5%) of former smokers and 6.5% (5.3–7.7%) of never smokers. Past experimentation
was the most prevalent pattern of e-cigarette use among ever users (P < 0.001). Almost 80% of ever and 90% of current
e-cigarette users were using nicotine. Extrapolated to the whole Attica population (3.1 million), there were 1 million
current smokers, 848,000 ever e-cigarette users and 155,000 current e-cigarette users. The majority of current e-cigarette
users (62.2%) were former smokers. Only 0.2% of never smokers were current e-cigarette users. One out of 20 participants
considered e-cigarettes a lot less harmful than smoking. Being current or former smoker were the strongest correlates
current e-cigarette use (OR 30.82, 95%CI 10. 21–69.33 and OR 69.33, 95%CI 23.12–207.90 respectively).
Conclusions: E-cigarette use in Greece is largely confined to current or former smokers, while current use and nicotine
use by never smokers is extremely rare. The majority of current e-cigarette users were former smokers. Most participants
overestimate the harmfulness of e-cigarettes relative to smoking.

Background
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been increasingly
popular over the past few years, and this has been a matter
of intense debate within the public health community. Two
major areas of concern are their safety/risk profile and pat-
terns of use by the population. For the former, currently
available evidence suggests that they are by far less harmful
than smoking; however, these estimates are mainly derived
from chemistry and toxicology studies, and there is still no
long-term epidemiological evidence to accurately quantify
the level of risk reduction [1–4]. Moreover, e-cigarettes emit
some toxins, although at low levels, suggesting that they are
not absolutely safe. The use and popularity of e-cigarettes
among various population subgroups can raise important is-
sues. From a public health perspective, e-cigarette use would
be desirable if it was confined to smokers and if the intended
use would be as substitute for smoking. Additionally, it is
important to assess whether e-cigarette use promotes smok-
ing cessation. On the contrary, use by non-smokers would
result in exposure to toxins which could confer some add-
itional health risk compared to not using any inhalational
product. Therefore, assessing the patterns of e-cigarette use
in the population, focusing on the smoking status of users,
is particularly important in determining the public health
impact of e-cigarettes [3].

 Few randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy
of e-cigarettes in smoking cessation and reduction have
shown modest results [5–7]. A metanalysis of such studies
has shown that e-cigarettes are effective in smoking cessa-
tion, but the level of evidence was low [8]. Several cohort
studies have shown mixed results [9–12], which was also
reflected in metanalyses showing that e-cigarettes pro-
mote, have no effect or prevent smoking cessation [13–
15]. Several concerns have been raised about these studies,
mainly methodological issues that create substantial bias
and make many of the studies unsuitable for evaluating
the effects of e-cigarettes on smoking cessation [16]. A re-
view of studies evaluating e-cigarettes effects on smoking
cessation identified that only a small proportion met the
proposed quality criteria [16]. Additionally, randomized
controlled trials have inherent problems, such as the long
duration for trial planning, recruitment, implementation
and analysis [17]. Thus, they may not be the best way of
assessing a behavioural intervention such as e-cigarette
use, with the large variability of devices and flavours being
used according to self-preference by consumers. In this
context, real world and population studies provide a useful
insight on the impact of e-cigarettes on smoking preva-
lence. In the UK, the increase in prevalence of e-cigarette
use by smokers was positively associated with the success
rates of quit attempts and the association remained sig-
nificant after adjustment for a range of confounding vari-
ables [18]. In their latest report, Public Health England
(PHE) estimated that e-cigarettes have contributed up to
57,000 additional former smokers in 2016 in the UK [19].
Greece historically has a high prevalence of smoking,
ranked among the highest within the European Union
[20]. In 2002, the prevalence of smoking was 39.2% in the
EU and 42% in Greece [21]. By 2014, the smoking preva-
lence was reduced to 26% in the EU (a 34% relative reduc-
tion) but remained quite high in Greece (38%, a 10%
relative reduction) [20]. While e-cigarettes appear to have
become popular in Greece, no published studies have pro-
vided any data on the true prevalence of e-cigarette use
and the patterns of use by different population subgroups.
For this reason, a cross-sectional study was performed in
2017, evaluating smoking and e-cigarette use in adult in-
habitants of the Attica prefecture, the largest prefecture of
Greece. The main aims of this study were to assess the (1)
e-cigarette awareness and prevalence of ever, current and
past e-cigarette use, as well as past experimentation; (2)
prevalence of nicotine-containing e-cigarette use; and (3)
correlates of ever and current e-cigarette use.
Methods
Design, setting and participants
The cross-sectional study was performed in May 2017 in
a sample of 4058 respondents aged ≥18 years. The popula-
tion of the survey was inhabitants in the Attica prefecture.
This region hosts 35% of the total adult population of
Greece according to Census 2011 (http://www.statistics.
gr/en/2011-census-pop-hous) and consists of the Regional
Departments of Athens, Piraeus, Eastern Attica and West-
ern Attica. The sample drawn was representative of the
prefecture of Attica population, with all registered landline
phone numbers being used as the sampling frame. Ac-
cording to the Hellenic Authority for Telecommunica-
tions and Postal services (www.eett.gr) landline phones
penetration in 2016 was 44.1% of the population, while
mobile phones was 148%. The above difference is a com-
mon example for a possible coverage error [22]. For the
landline phones, the potential issue on the survey is the
under-coverage, but for the usage of mobiles phones, it is
the over-coverage. Unfortunately, there is no reliable
benchmark study for the Greek population that identifies
the direction, strength and potential implications of the
coverage error. Using the landline phones prevented the
error of over-presenting into the sample people that own
more than one mobile phone. The mode of data collection
was computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI), and
the sample design was stratified random sampling. Further
post-survey adjustment weights were applied in order to
depict sample composition as the actual population
demographics.
The study was approved by the ethics committee of the
Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center (reference no. 591/14.12.
16). All participants provided verbal consent at the begin-
ning of the interview in order to participate to this study.
Sociodemographic factors
The exact age of the participants was recorded and then
recoded into five categories (18–24, 25–39, 40–54 and
55 years and older). Education was coded as “high
school or less”, “technical education”, “university educa-
tion” and “postgraduate education”. Marital status was
recorded and categorized as “single”, “married/living
with a partner” and “widowed/divorced”. The financial
status of the participants was assessed through a ques-
tion seeking a self-assessment report of the financial
conditions
of
each
household:
“How
would
you
characterize your financial situation?”. Response options
were “We are unable to cope with our household fi-
nances” (very bad financial situation), “We are able to
cope with our household finances, but with a lot of diffi-
culties” (bad financial situation), “We are able to to cope
with our household finances, but without the ability to
save a lot of money” (not good financial situation), and
“We don’t have financial problems” (good financial
situation).
This
variable
attempts
to
accommodate
measurement issues, processing errors and item non-
response errors [22, 23]. For the analysis, responses were
recoded into three groups (“very bad/bad”, “not good”,
and “good”).

 Smoking and e-cigarette use
Participants were categorized according to their smoking
status as current smokers, past smokers and never
smokers.
Current
and former smokers
were asked
whether
they
were
smoking
daily
or
occasionally.
Current daily smokers were asked whether they had
tried to quit smoking in the past 3 years and, if yes,
which smoking cessation methods they had used. Re-
sponse options were “Nicotine replacement therapies”,
“Oral smoking cessation medications”, “Psychological
support”, “E-cigarettes” and “By myself (without any aid)
”, with participants being able to choose multiple
responses.
E-cigarette awareness was assessed by asking: “Have
you ever heard of e-cigarettes?”. Those responding “No”
were classified as never e-cigarette users and no further
questions about e-cigarettes were asked. E-cigarette use
was assessed by asking: “Regarding the use of e-
cigarettes, which of the following statements applies to
you?”
The
responses
“I
currently
use
e-cigarettes”
(current use), “I used them in the past, but no longer
use them” (past use) and “I tried them in the past only
once or twice” (past experimentation) were categorized
as ever e-cigarette use. The response “I have never used
them” was categorized as never use. A separate question
assessed
the
use
of
nicotine-containing
e-cigarettes
among ever e-cigarette users, by asking “Do/did you use
nicotine in your e-cigarette?” Current and past e-
cigarette users were asked whether they use or used the
e-cigarette daily or occasionally. The harm perception
for e-cigarettes was examined by asking “Do you think
e-cigarettes are…”, with available responses being “A lot
more harmful than tobacco cigarettes”, “More harmful
than tobacco cigarettes”, “As harmful as tobacco ciga-
rettes”, “Less harmful than tobacco cigarettes”, “A lot
less harmful than tobacco cigarettes”, “Absolutely harm-
less” and “Don’t know”.
Statistical analysis
All values were presented as weighted proportions with
95%CI, while the projected number within the Attica
population was extrapolated based on the total sampling
population using an appropriate weighing variable. Dif-
ferences in prevalence of e-cigarette current use, past
use and past experimentation were assessed using chi-
square
(χ2)
test.
Two
separate
logistic
regression
analyses were performed to assess correlates of ever and
current e-cigarette use, similarly to a previous analysis of
data from Eurobarometer 2014 [24]. Independent vari-
ables included all demographics as well as the percep-
tion of e-cigarette harmfulness. The latter was recoded
as a binary variable, with responses “A lot more harmful
than tobacco cigarettes”, “More harmful than tobacco
cigarettes”, “As harmful as tobacco cigarettes” and
“Don’t know” coded as 1 and “Less harmful than tobacco
cigarettes”, “A lot less harmful than tobacco cigarettes”
and “Absolutely harmless” coded as 2. All analyses were
weighted and were performed with commercially avail-
able software (SPSS v.22.0, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Smoking and e-cigarette use in the population of Attica
Participant
demographics
are
presented
in
Add-
itional file 1: Table S1. The prevalence of smoking and
e-cigarette use is shown in Table 1. Current smoking
was reported by 32.6% of the population while an add-
itional 29.7% were former smokers. The majority were
daily smokers (85.8% for current smokers and 76.9% for
former smokers). Cessation attempts over the past
3 years were reported by 46.9% (95%CI 44.0–49.8%) of
current daily smokers. Among these, quitting without
any aid was the most popular method (74.6%, 95%CI
70.9–78.3%), followed by e-cigarettes (47.4%, 95%CI
43.1–51.6%), nicotine replacement therapies (13.0%,
95%CI 10.1–15.8%) and oral smoking cessation medica-
tions (4.9%, 95%CI 3.1–6.7%). Extrapolated to the total
Attica population, there were 194,000 current daily
smokers who had used e-cigarettes in a smoking cessa-
tion attempt compared to 53,000 using nicotine replace-
ment therapies and 20,000 using oral smoking cessation
medications.
More than 9 out of 10 participants were aware of e-
cigarettes. Ever e-cigarette use was reported by 27.2% of
the population. Current e-cigarette use was reported by
5.0% of the population, while 1 out of 10 participants
reported being past e-cigarette users. The majority
were daily e-cigarette users (78.8% for current and 79.9%
for past e-cigarette users). Past experimentation was the
most prevalent pattern of e-cigarette use for the whole
population of ever e-cigarette users (χ2 = 142.5, P < 0.001).
Nicotine use was reported by the majority of ever e-
cigarette users and was more prevalent in current (88.9%)
and past e-cigarette users (84.0%) compared to past exper-
imenters (68.6%; χ2 = 61.8, P < 0.001). Extrapolated to the
total population of 3.1 million adult inhabitants in Attica,
there were 1 million current smokers, 848,000 ever
e-cigarette users and 155,000 current e-cigarette users at
the time of the survey.
E-cigarette use according to the smoking status
The prevalence of e-cigarette use according to the smok-
ing status is shown in Table 2, including data on daily use
and nicotine-containing e-cigarette use. From the total
population of ever e-cigarette users, 64.8% were current
smokers, 26.2% were former smokers and 9.0% were never
smokers. From the total population of current e-cigarette
users, 36.3% were current smokers, 62.2% were former
smokers and 1.5% were never smokers.

 Among
ever
e-cigarette
users
who
were
current
smokers, past experimentation and past e-cigarette use
were more prevalent compared to current e-cigarette
use (χ2 = 197.2, P < 0.001). Among ever e-cigarette users
who were former smokers, current e-cigarette use was
more prevalent than former e-cigarette use and past e-
cigarette experimentation (χ2 = 15.1, P = 0.001). Among
ever e-cigarette users who were never smokers, past e-
cigarette experimentation was by far the most prevalent
pattern of use (χ2 = 178.6, P < 0.001). Characteristically,
92.9% of never smoking ever e-cigarette users reported
past experimentation only. The majority of current and
former smokers reported daily current and past e-
cigarette use. For never smokers, all current and past e-
cigarette users reported daily use but the overall preva-
lence of e-cigarette use was very low in this population
subgroup.
Similar patterns of use were observed for nicotine-
containing
e-cigarettes,
with
approximately
90%
of
current e-cigarette users who reported being current or
former smokers were using nicotine. However, such use
was very rare among never smokers. Only 1 never-
smoking participant reported being current, and 2 re-
ported being former nicotine containing e-cigarette
users.
Perception of e-cigarette harmfulness
The perception of e-cigarette harmfulness for the whole
population and according to the smoking status is pre-
sented in Table 3. The most prevalent perceptions were
that e-cigarettes are equally or less harmful than tobacco
cigarettes. A remarkably low proportion perceived e-
cigarettes as a lot less harmful than cigarettes, including
among current smokers, and a substantial proportion
responded that they did not know. While no statistically
significant differences were observed in the perceptions
that e-cigarettes are a lot more or more harmful than
smoking, a larger proportion of never smokers consid-
ered
e-cigarettes
less
harmful
than
smoking.

 Additionally,
more

smokers
considered
e-
cigarettes a lot less harmful than smoking or absolutely
harmless and more current smokers were uncertain
about the harmfulness of e-cigarettes.
Correlates of current and ever e-cigarette use
The results of the logistic regression analyses are pre-
sented in Table 4. Being current or former smoker were
the strongest correlates of ever e-cigarette use. Age
younger than 55, male gender and perception of low
harm for e-cigarettes were also correlates of ever e-
cigarette use. University education and being married/
living with partner were negatively associated with ever
e-cigarette use.
For current e-cigarette use, being current or former
smoker were also by far the strongest correlates. Age
25–39 years, male gender and perception of low harm
for
e-cigarettes
were also
correlates
of
current
e-
cigarette use. University education was negatively associ-
ated with current e-cigarette use.
Discussion
This study presents the first evidence on prevalence and
patterns of e-cigarette use in Greece, a European country
with a very high prevalence of smoking. The study iden-
tified almost universal awareness of e-cigarettes, while
more than 1 out of 4 participants reported ever e-
cigarette use. However, current e-cigarette use was sub-
stantially lower and mainly confined to current and
former smokers, with the latter representing the majority
of current e-cigarette users.
The prevalence of current e-cigarette use in Greece is
similar to the UK, where it was recently reported that 5.
8% of the population is using e-cigarettes [25]. In the EU
in 2014, current e-cigarette use was reported by 1.8% of
the population, with 60% of current users reporting daily
use [24, 26]. In the United States (US) in 2014, the
prevalence of current e-cigarette use (defined as any past
30-day use) was 5.5%, with only 21.3% of those reporting
daily use. These data identify higher prevalence and
more intense use by the Greek population compared to
the average use in the EU and the US while use preva-
lence is similar compared to the UK, a country with a
positive environment for e-cigarettes among the public
health community. There has been a lot of debate about
the definition of current e-cigarette use in the US, de-
fined as any past 30-day use, because it includes a lot
of recent experimenters [27]. Additionally, frequency
of e-cigarette use is positively associated with both
quit attempts and quit success [28]. Considering that
frequency of use seems to vary considerably between
different populations, it is important to record such
information in population surveys in order to make
proper comparisons. Frequency of use and nicotine
use are among the principle items that are recom-
mended as measures included in population surveys
examining e-cigarette use [29].
An important finding of this study is the high propor-
tion of current e-cigarette users who were former
smokers. Being current and former smoker were the
strongest correlates of e-cigarette use, with a particularly
strong association observed for former smokers. E-
cigarettes were also by far the most popular smoking
cessation aid among current daily smokers. Similar find-
ings have been observed in the UK where the proportion
of e-cigarette users being former smokers surpassed
current smokers for the first time in 2017 [25] while,
over the past 3 years, e-cigarettes have replaced nicotine
replacement therapies as the most popular alternative to
smoking for people trying to quit [30]. Current e-
cigarette use was remarkably uncommon among Greek
never smokers. These findings provide indirect evidence
that e-cigarette use is maintained because it helps
smokers quit, while e-cigarettes are not attractive to
never smokers. This represents a desirable effect from a
public health perspective and appears reassuring for the
potential threat that e-cigarettes act as a gateway to
smoking. However, there are inherent limitations in

 cross-sectional surveys when addressing such research
questions, which are discussed below.
An important issue raised by the study herein is the
overestimation of e-cigarette harmfulness relative to
smoking. Only about 1 in 20 participants correctly con-
sidered e-cigarettes as a lot less harmful than smoking
while perceptions of low harmfulness was a correlate of
ever and current e-cigarette use. Such misconceptions
were more pronounced among smokers. Several studies
have shown a growing misconception in the general
population about the relative risks of e-cigarettes [25,
31–33]. Brose et al. found that perception of low harm
predicted subsequent use of e-cigarettes in a cohort of
current and former smokers [31]. A cross-sectional sur-
vey of dedicated vapers found that perception of low
harm was independently associated with being exclusive
e-cigarette
user
rather
than
dual
user
[34].
Since
overestimating
their
harmfulness
may
discourage
smokers from using e-cigarettes in an effort to quit
smoking, there is a need to provide accurately and reli-
able information about the risks of smoking and e-
cigarette use, particularly to smokers [19, 35]. Studies
need to examine the factors associated with such mis-
conceptions. For example, media articles that largely ex-
aggerate the potential adverse health effects of e-
cigarettes and provide no comparison with the effects of
smoking, a phenomenon that is frequently observed in
Greece, could be responsible for providing misleading

Limitations applicable to this study are the inherent
weaknesses of cross-sectional studies. Associations can-
not be interpreted as causation, while lack of temporality
does not allow for determining if e-cigarette use pre-
ceded

 smoking status was self-reported and not objectively
verified, which is common for large population studies.
Still, the study is valuable in showing for the first time
that e-cigarette use in the Greek population is adopted
by smokers only and is minimal among never smokers,
largely rejecting the concerns about gateway to smoking
effects.
Conclusions
In conclusion, current e-cigarette use in Greece is pre-
dominantly confined among current and former smokers.
In never smokers, minimal experimentation and almost
no current use was observed. The majority of current
e-cigarette users reported being former smokers, while
e-cigarettes are the most popular smoking cessation aid
among current daily smokers over the past 3 years. The
findings suggest a positive public health impact of
e-cigarettes in Greece, which is particularly important for
a country having a high prevalence of smoking, and pro-
vide reassurance that e-cigarettes are not popular among
never smokers. However, major misconceptions about the
relative risks of e-cigarettes compared to smoking exist in
the population, and this needs to be addressed.
