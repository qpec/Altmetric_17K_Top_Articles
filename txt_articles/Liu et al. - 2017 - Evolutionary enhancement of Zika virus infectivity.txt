in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes

Zika virus (ZIKV) remained obscure until the recent explosive 
outbreaks in French Polynesia (2013–2014) and South America 
(2015–2016)1–3. Phylogenetic studies have shown that ZIKV has 
evolved into African and Asian lineages. The Asian lineage of 
ZIKV was responsible for the recent epidemics in the Americas1,3. 
However, the underlying mechanisms through which ZIKV rapidly 
and explosively spread from Asia to the Americas are unclear. 
Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) facilitates flavivirus acquisition by 
mosquitoes from an infected mammalian host and subsequently 
enhances viral prevalence in mosquitoes4. Here we show that NS1 
antigenaemia determines ZIKV infectivity in its mosquito vector 
Aedes aegypti, which acquires ZIKV via a blood meal. Clinical 
isolates from the most recent outbreak in the Americas were much 
more infectious in mosquitoes than the FSS13025 strain, which was 
isolated in Cambodia in 2010. Further analyses showed that these 
epidemic strains have higher NS1 antigenaemia than the FSS13025 
strain because of an alanine-to-valine amino acid substitution at 
residue 188 in NS1. ZIKV infectivity was enhanced by this amino 
acid substitution in the ZIKV FSS13025 strain in mosquitoes that 
acquired ZIKV from a viraemic C57BL/6 mouse deficient in type I 
and II interferon (IFN) receptors (AG6 mouse). Our results reveal 
that ZIKV evolved to acquire a spontaneous mutation in its NS1 
protein, resulting in increased NS1 antigenaemia. Enhancement of 
NS1 antigenaemia in infected hosts promotes ZIKV infectivity and 
prevalence in mosquitoes, which could have facilitated transmission 
during recent ZIKV epidemics.
Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne virus belonging to the genus 
flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae, is transmitted to humans by 
Aedes mosquito species1,5. Several neurological complications, such 
as Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults6 and microcephaly in newborn 
babies7, have been associated with ZIKV infection. Before 2007, cases 
of ZIKV infection were detected only sporadically1,8. The first reported 
mild ZIKV outbreak occurred in 2007 on Yap Island in Western 
Pacific Micronesia9. In 2013, a larger ZIKV epidemic was recorded 
in French Polynesia and other Southern Pacific islands2,10. In 2015, 
ZIKV emerged in the Americas for the first time, rapidly spreading 
to 20 countries or territories3. Phylogenetic studies have revealed that 
ZIKV has evolved into African and Asian clusters1,3. Sequence analyses 
have shown that the ZIKV strains that caused the earlier outbreaks in 
Micronesia (2007) and French Polynesia (2013–2014) and later out-
breaks in the Americas (2015–2016) all belong to the Asian clade1, 
suggesting that increased infectivity of the Asian ZIKV lineage might 
have contributed to the recent epidemic.
Evolutionary increases in the infectivity of mosquito-borne viruses 
within their vectors results in high epidemic potential11,12. We speculate 
that the adaptability and infectivity of ZIKV within its mosquito vectors

might have evolved over time, contributing to the prevalence and spread 
of the virus from Asia to the Americas. To test this hypothesis, we com-
pared the viral infectivity of two clinical ZIKV isolates of the Asian 
lineage, GZ01 (isolated in 201613) and FSS13025 (isolated in 201014,15), 
in the primary urban mosquito vector A. aegypti. Phylogenetic analysis 
showed that these two strains represent the clades corresponding to the 
epidemic strains of ZIKV that are prevalent in the Americas (2015–
2016) and Southeastern Asia (2007–2012) (Extended Data Fig. 1). 
 
Thus, we exploited a ‘host–mosquito’ acquisition model, in which 
mosquitoes acquire ZIKV from a viraemic AG6 mouse4,16,17, to assess 
the infectivity of these ZIKV strains (Fig. 1a). Both strains exhibited 
similar replication kinetics in the blood of infected AG6 mice (Fig. 1b). 
 
However, the serum level of secreted NS1 was much lower in mice 
infected with the FSS13025 strain than the GZ01 strain (Fig. 1c). 
The infected mice were subjected to daily biting by the Rockefeller 
laboratory strain of A. aegypti from days 1 to 5 after mouse infection

(Fig. 1a). Infection prevalence was substantially lower in mosquitoes 
that fed on FSS13025-infected mice than in those that fed on GZ01-
infected mice (Fig. 1d, e).
Secretion of NS1 into the serum of an infected host is a common 
property of many flaviviruses4,18–21. Our previous study demonstrated 
that circulating NS1 acquired by mosquitoes together with virions 
when mosquitoes feed on a viraemic mammalian host enhances viral 
infectivity4. NS1 antigenaemia plays a key role in maintaining the 
 
flavivirus life cycle4. We hypothesize that NS1 antigenaemia is respon-
sible for the difference in mosquito infectivity between the GZ01 and 
FSS13025 strains. We therefore infected Vero cells (a monkey kidney 
cell line) with the American isolates GZ01 and PRVABC5922, the SZ01 
strain representing the French Polynesian clade23, and the FSS13025 
strain. The three post-epidemic strains showed higher NS1 secretion 
than the FSS13025 strain (Fig. 2a–c), even when NS1 amount was 
 
normalized to viral titre (Fig. 2c).
To determine whether NS1 secretability correlates with ZIKV infec-
tivity in mosquitoes, we generated a mouse NS1 polyclonal antibody 
(Extended Data Fig. 2a). Neutralization of NS1 by antibody treatment 
 
reduced the mosquito infection prevalence of the GZ01 strain 
 
(Fig. 2d–f). The mouse NS1 antibodies did not neutralize ZIKV virions 
(Extended Data Fig. 3). We also tested whether the addition of NS1 
 
protein could enhance ZIKV infectivity. A recombinant GZ01 NS1 protein 
 
was expressed and purified using a Drosophila S2 expression system 
(Extended Data Fig. 2b). The presence of NS1 increased the infectivity 
of the FSS13025 strain in mosquitoes (Fig. 2g–i). We next assessed 
the threshold concentration of NS1 that can effectively enhance ZIKV 
acquisition. Compared to bovine serum albumin (BSA), the presence 
of 100 ng ml−1 or higher concentrations of NS1 substantially increased 
ZIKV prevalence in A. aegypti (Fig. 2j–l). To identify the role of animal 
 
NS1 antigenaemia in ZIKV infectivity in mosquitoes, we allowed 
 
mosquitoes to feed on viraemic AG6 mice (Extended Data Fig. 4a). 
The NS1 antibody treatment reduced the quantity of circulating NS1 
in mouse serum (Extended Data Fig. 4b) but did not influence GZ01 
ZIKV replication in AG6 mice (Extended Data Fig. 4c). The infec-
tion ratios of fed A. aegypti were reduced as a result of the antibody- 
mediated neutralization of NS1 in mice (Extended Data Fig. 4d, e).
Considering the difference in secretion of NS1 between the GZ01 
and FSS13025 strains (Figs 1c, 2a–c), we next attempted to identify the 
amino acids that are critical for NS1 secretion. We focused on the endo-
plasmic reticulum transmembrane region of pre-membrane (prM), the 
full length of envelope (E), and NS1 (prM-E-NS1)24 (Fig. 3a). There are 
only two sites that vary between the GZ01 and FSS13025 prM-E-NS1 
proteins: residue 473 in the E protein (Val/FSS13025 to Met/GZ01) and 
residue 188 in the NS1 protein (Ala/FSS13025 to Val/GZ01) (Fig. 3a). 
 
We therefore individually subcloned the prM-E-NS1 regions from 
the GZ01 and FSS13025 strains and subsequently transfected these 
segments into 293T cells. Ectopic expression of the GZ01 prM-E-NS1 
protein, but not the FSS13025 protein, led to abundant NS1 secretion in 
the supernatants of transfected cells (Fig. 3b). Mutation from valine to 
methionine at residue 473 of the E protein in the FSS13025 prM-E-NS1 
protein did not improve NS1 secretion; however, the alanine-to-valine 
substitution at residue 188 of NS1 rendered NS1 secretable (Fig. 3b), 
 
demonstrating that this single mutation determines NS1 secreta-
bility. Residue 188 is located within the interface between two NS1 
 
monomers25 (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Nonetheless, the alanine-to- 
valine substitution at position 188 does not influence NS1 dimerization 
(Extended Data Fig. 5b), suggesting that the mechanism by which the 
single mutation affects NS1 remains to be identified.
We next performed an alignment of the NS1 proteins from the Asian 
clade of ZIKV
. In ZIKV isolates collected before 2012, residue 188 of the 
NS1 protein was alanine. However, this residue was mutated to valine in 
all isolates collected after 2013 (Extended Data Fig. 6), suggesting that 
the Asian lineage of ZIKV evolved to acquire NS1 secretability when it 
spread from southeastern Asia to the Southern Pacific islands around 
2013. Correspondingly, Singapore reported local ZIKV transmission in 
August 2016. The Singaporean strains stemmed from an ancestral node 
of the Asian lineage26. In all ZIKV isolates from Singapore, residue 188 
of the NS1 protein was a valine (Extended Data Fig. 6), suggesting that 
the alanine-to-valine substitution may have contributed to the recent 
ZIKV epidemics. Therefore, we synthesized the prM-E-NS1 genes from 
a Malaysia P6-740 strain isolated in 1966 and a Micronesian 2007 strain 
and ectopically expressed these genes in 293T cells. Compared to the 
secretion of NS1 in the supernatants of GZ01 prM-E-NS1-transfected 
cells, the NS1 protein was hardly detectable in the supernatants of these

pre-epidemic ZIKV prM-E-NS1-expressing cells (Fig. 3c). However, 
the alanine-to-valine mutation in the NS1 protein of the P6-740 strain 
conferred NS1 secretability (Fig. 3d).
Next, we created the alanine-to-valine mutation at residue 188 of the 
NS1 protein in an infectious clone of the FSS13025 strain (FSS13025-
A188V)15. The substitution substantially increased NS1 secretion in 
the supernatant of infected Vero cells (Extended Data Fig. 7a–c). The 
FSS13025-A188V strain showed higher ZIKV infectivity than the 
 
wild-type virus in mosquitoes (Extended Data Fig. 7d, e). In the mouse–
mosquito acquisition model, NS1 antigenaemia was increased in the 
serum of FSS13025-A188V ZIKV-infected mice (Fig. 3e). Mutation of 
residue 188 of NS1 did not influence viral infectivity or dissemination 
kinetics in infected AG6 mouse blood (Fig. 3f). However, the substitu-
tion enhanced ZIKV transmission from mice to mosquitoes (Fig. 3g, h). 
 
Moreover, neutralization of NS1 with mouse ZIKV NS1 antibodies 
effectively reduced the prevalence of FSS13025-A188V ZIKV in mos-
quitoes (Extended Data Fig. 8a–d), confirming that the valine at residue 
188 of NS1 has a critical role in antigenaemia, which is essential for 
ZIKV acquisition by mosquitoes.
We next investigated whether NS1-mediated enhancement of 
ZIKV infectivity influenced the prevalence of ZIKV-carrying mos-
quitoes using a mosquito–mouse–mosquito transmission cycle. We 
thoracically inoculated equal titres (5 plaque-forming units (p.f.u.)) 
of the GZ01, FSS13025 and FSS13025-A188V mutant strains into 
female A. aegypti mosquitoes. Six days after virus inoculation, two 
infected mosquitoes were allowed to feed on AG6 mice (Fig. 4a). The 
 
mosquito-bitten animals developed high-titre viraemia for all three ZIKV 
strains (Fig. 4b). Replication of both the GZ01 and FSS13025-A188V 
ZIKV strains, but not the FSS13025 strain, resulted in efficient NS1 anti-
genaemia (Fig. 4c). Subsequently, the infected mice were subjected to 
daily biting by naive A. aegypti from days 1 to 8 after mouse infection 
(Fig. 4a). Through a complete transmission cycle, the FSS13025-A188V 
strain showed a substantially higher prevalence of mosquito infection 
than did the FSS13025 strain (Fig. 4d, e), demonstrating that the valine 
at residue 188 is required for the generation of NS1 antigenaemia, which 
enhances ZIKV transmissibility from hosts to vectors.
ZIKV independently separated into the African and Asian lineages. 
 
We found that residue 188 in all ZIKV African strains was valine 
(Extended Data Fig. 9a). The Uganda MR766-infected Vero cells 
abundantly secreted NS1 (Extended Data Fig. 9b–d), implying that 
infection with African ZIKV might produce high NS1 antigenaemia. 
ZIKV has two ecologically distinct transmission cycles: a sylvatic cycle 
(mosquitoes to non-human primates) and a human cycle (mosquitoes 
to humans)27. Knowledge of ZIKV before 2012 was almost exclusively 
centred on the enzootic sylvatic cycle in Africa27,28. A mosquito sur-
vey in Africa showed that ZIKV was detected in mosquitoes collected 
in multiple surveyed landscapes, except for indoor locations within 
 
villages28. Therefore, we hypothesize that the presence of a valine at 
 
residue 188 of NS1 might bestow on the African lineage of ZIKV a 
highly efficient enzootic or epizootic transmission cycle27,28. Other 
unknown factor(s) might prevent African ZIKV from efficiently 
establishing a human infection cycle. However, the Asian strains may 
have evolved to target humans with high infectivity; indeed, one such 
strain caused a medium-scale epidemic in Micronesia in 20071,9. The 
alanine-to-valine substitution at position 188 further improved ZIKV 
transmission efficiency from humans to mosquitoes and thus increased 
its prevalence in mosquitoes. Our data offer a potential explanation 
for the recent re-emergence of ZIKV, and suggest that co-evolution of 
arboviruses with their hosts or vectors contributes to their long-term 
existence and occasional widespread re-emergence.

Ethics statement. Human blood for mosquito feeding was taken from healthy 
donors who provided written informed consent. The collection of human blood 
samples was approved by the local ethics committee at Tsinghua University.
Mice, mosquitoes, cells and viruses. AG6 mice were donated by the Institute 
Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The mice were bred and 
maintained under a specific pathogen-free animal facility at Tsinghua University. 
Groups of age- and sex-matched AG6 mice, 6–8 weeks of age, were used for the 
animal studies4. All experiments were approved by and performed under the 
guidelines of the Experimental Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee of Tsinghua 
University. A. aegypti (Rockefeller strain) were reared in a low-temperature, 
 
illuminated incubator (Model 818, Thermo Electron Corporation) at 28 °C and 
80% humidity according to standard rearing procedures29. The ZIKV GZ01 
(KU820898), PRVABC59 (KU501215), SZ01 (KU866423), MR766 (NC_012532) 
and FSS13025 (KU955593)15 strains were grown in Vero cells for blood meals4. The 
Drosophila melanogaster S2 cell line was cultured in Schneider’s medium with 10% 
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic (15240-062, 
Invitrogen). The Vero cells and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s mod-
ified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated 
fetal bovine serum (16000-044, Gibco). For ZIKV infection, the Vero cells were 
maintained in VP-SFM medium (11681-020, Gibco). The Vero and 293T cell lines 
were purchased from the ATCC (CCL81, CRL-3216).The Drosophila S2 cell line 
was sourced from a Drosophila expression system of Invitrogen (R690-07). None 
of these cell lines were found in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines 
maintained by ICLAC and NCBI Biosample. All these cell lines were authenticated 
by ATCC or Invitrogen and do not have mycoplasma contamination. ZIKV was 
titred by a plaque formation (p.f.u.) assay29.
Antibodies. The ZIKV NS1 genes were amplified from the cDNA of infected cells 
and cloned into a pET-28a (+ 
) expression vector (69864, Millipore). The cloning 
primers are presented in Extended Data Table 1. Recombinant NS1 proteins were 
expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 strain in an insoluble form in inclusion 
bodies. The proteins were then solubilized by 8 M urea and purified with a TALON 
Purification Kit (635515, Clontech). Mouse antisera were produced via inoculation 
with recombinant ZIKV NS1 with three boosts. Polyclonal antibodies were purified 
from the immunized antisera using protein A/G agarose (20423, Thermo). The 
anti-V5-HRP antibody for tag detection was purchased from Invitrogen (R96125, 
Thermo).
Expression of prM-E-NS1 protein in human cells. The prM-E-NS1 regions (base 
pairs 820–3,438 in GZ01 KU820898; 927–3,545 in FSS13025 KU955593) were 
amplified from cDNA of infected cells. The prM-E-NS1 genes from the P6-740 
strain (base pairs 820–3,438, HQ234499) and the Micronesian 2007 strain (base 
pairs 820–3,438, EU545988) were commercially synthesized (Genescript). All the 
genes were subcloned into a pcDNA3.1/V5-His/TOPO DNA vector (K4800-01, 
Invitrogen), and subsequently transfected using X-treme Gene HP DNA trans-
fection reagent (06366236001, Roche) for ectopic expression in 293T cells. The 
amount of NS1 in the supernatants of the 293T cells was measured 48 h after trans-
fection. The cloning primers are shown in Extended Data Table 1.
ZIKV NS1 protein generation in a Drosophila expression system. The ZIKV 
NS1 gene was cloned into a pMT/BiP/V5-His A vector (V4130-20, Invitrogen) for 
expression in Drosophila S2 cells. The cloning primers are shown in Extended Data 
Table 1. The procedure for ZIKV NS1 expression and purification in a Drosophila 
expression system has been described previously4,29.
ZIKV NS1 detection by ELISA. Secretion of ZIKV NS1 into Vero cell supernatant 
and mouse serum was measured using a ZIKV NS1 Antigen ELISA Kit (ZIKV-
NS1-EK, BioFront MonoTrace). The experiment was performed according to the 
kit’s manual. Samples were diluted to the range of quantification of the kit using the 
sample dilution buffer provided in the kit. Standard materials for the generation of 
a standard curve were also provided in the kit. The measured amount of ZIKV NS1 
matched the linearity in the assay. Optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm 
with an ELISA reader (Varioskan Flash Multimode Reader, Thermo Scientific). 
The detection limit of NS1 protein by ELISA is 0.1 ng ml−1.
Thoracic inoculation of ZIKV in mosquitoes. Detailed procedures for micro-
injection in mosquitoes have been described previously4,29. In brief, female 
 
A. aegypti mosquitoes were anaesthetized on a cold tray, and subsequently a certain 
titre (5 p.f.u.) of ZIKV was microinjected into the mosquito thoraxes. The infected 
mosquitoes were used for ZIKV transmission to AG6 mice by a blood meal.
Membrane blood feeding. Fresh human blood was placed in heparin-coated tubes 
(367884, BD Vacutainer) and centrifuged at 1,000g and 4 °C for 10 min to separate 
the plasma from the blood cells. The plasma was collected and heat-inactivated at 
55 °C for 60 min. The separated blood cells were washed three times with PBS to 
remove the anticoagulant. The cells were then resuspended in the heat-inactivated 
plasma. The donor sera were negative for the E and NS1 proteins of JEV
, DENV and 
ZIKV. Either purified proteins or antibodies were mixed with the ZIKV-infected 
supernatant and human blood for mosquito oral feeding via a Hemotek system 
(6W1, Hemotek Limited). Engorged female mosquitoes were transferred into new 
containers and maintained under standard conditions for an additional 8 days. The 
mosquitoes were subsequently killed for further analysis.
Mosquito feeding on infected mice. Eight to ten female A. aegypti mosquitoes 
were separated into a netting-covered container for blood feeding. The mosqui-
toes were starved for 24 h before engorgement. ZIKV-infected AG6 mice were 
anaesthetized and placed on top of the container. The mosquitoes were allowed 
to feed on the mice for 30 min in the dark. After being anaesthetized using ice, the 
engorged mosquitoes were transferred to new containers and maintained under 
standard conditions for an additional 8 days. The mosquitoes were subsequently 
killed for further analysis.
Purification of infectious ZIKV virions. The purification of flaviviral infectious 
virions has been described previously4. In brief, supernatant from GZ01-infected 
Vero cells was collected 5 days after infection. Cell fragments were removed by 
 
centrifugation at 25,000g and 4 °C for 20 min. Subsequently, the supernatant was 
carefully transferred into a clean centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 25,000g and 
4 °C for an additional 6 h to pellet the virions. The precipitated virions were washed 
twice and then solubilized in VP-SFM medium (11681-020, Gibco). Insoluble 
material was removed by an extra centrifugation step at 12,000g and 4 °C for 2 min. 
The virions in the VP-SFM medium were aliquoted and stored at − 
80 °C.
Viral genome quantification by TaqMan qPCR. Total RNA was isolated 
from homogenized mosquitoes using an RNeasy Mini Kit (74106, Qiagen) and 
reverse-transcribed into cDNA using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (170-8890, 
Bio-Rad). Viral genomes were quantified via TaqMan qPCR amplification of ZIKV 
genes, normalized against A. aegypti actin (AAEL011197). The detection limit of 
ZIKV E/Actin mRNA ratio is 0.001. The primers and probes used for this analysis 
are shown in Extended Data Table 1.
Determination of the virus titre in infected mice by plaque assay. Blood sam-
ples were collected from the tail veins of infected mice in 0.4% sodium citrate 
and were centrifuged for 5 min at 6,000g and 4 °C to isolate plasma. The presence 
 
of infectious viral particles in the plasma was determined using a plaque assay4. 
The detection limit in the plaque assay is 10 p.f.u. ml−1 in cell supernatant, and 
100 p.f.u. ml−1 in serum.
RNA transcription, transfection and virus recovery. The pFLZIKV-FSS13025 
and pFLZIKV-FSS13025-A188V15 plasmids were amplified in E. coli Top10 
(C404010, Invitrogen) and purified using MaxiPrep PLUS (12965, Qiagen). For 
in vitro transcription, 10 μ 
g plasmid was linearized with the restriction enzyme 
ClaI. A mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 kit (AM1344, Ambion) was used for 
 
in vitro transcription of RNA in a 20 μ 
l reaction with an additional 1 μ 
l of 30 mM 
GTP solution. The RNA was precipitated with lithium chloride and quantified by 
spectrophotometry. Subsequently, the RNA was transfected into Vero cells seeded 
in a T175 flask with DMEM medium and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 using 
Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (L3000015, Invitrogen). Recombinant viruses in cell 
culture media were harvested 4 days after transfection, stored in aliquots at − 
80 °C, 
and subjected to further investigation.
Statistics. Animals were randomly allocated into different groups. Mosquitoes 
that died before measurement were excluded from analysis. The investigators 
were not blinded to allocation during the experiments or to the outcome assess-
ment. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Descriptive 
statistics have been provided in the figure legends. Kruskal–Wallis analysis of 
variance was conducted to detect any significant variation among replicates. 
If no significant variation was detected, the results were pooled for further 
comparison. Given the nature of the experiments and the types of samples, 
differences between continuous variables were assessed with a non-parametric 
Mann–Whitney test. Differences in mosquito infective rates were analysed using 
Fisher’s exact test. P values were adjusted using the Bonferroni correction to 
account for multiple comparisons. All analyses were performed using GraphPad 
Prism statistical software.

Extended Data Figure 3 | Anti-ZIKV NS1 antibodies did not neutralize 
ZIKV virions. We premixed two dilutions of mouse ZIKV NS1 polyclonal 
antisera (1:100 and 1:1,000) with purified ZIKV GZ01 infectious virions. 
The same amount of pre-immune serum served as a negative control. 
After a 30-min incubation, the infectivity of the antibody–virion mixture 
was determined by plaque assay on Vero cells. The values in the graph 
represent the mean ± s.e.m. P values were determined by two-tailed 
Mann–Whitney test. The data were combined from three biological 
repeats. NS, not significant.

Extended Data Figure 4 | Passive transfer of ZIKV NS1 antibodies 
into infected AG6 mice prevented ZIKV acquisition by A. aegypti. 
a, Schematic representation of the study design. AG6 mice were 
intradermally infected with 1 × 104 p.f.u. of the ZIKV GZ01 strain. 
Subsequently, 100 μ 
l of a mouse ZIKV NS1 antibody was intraperitoneally 
inoculated into the mice 12 h after infection. The same amount of pre-
immune serum was inoculated as a mock control. After 12 h of antibody 
dissemination, the infected mice were subjected to daily biting by female 
A. aegypti from days 1 to 5 after mouse infection. The mouse-blood-fed 
mosquitoes were reared for an additional 8 days for ZIKV detection.  
b, ZIKV NS1 measurement by ELISA (n = 6 mice per group pooled from  
3 independent biological replicates). Mouse serum was collected to 
quantify ZIKV NS1 protein from days 0 to 6 after mouse infection.  
c, Detection of the ZIKV load in the blood of the infected mice (n = 8 mice 
per group pooled from 4 independent biological replicates). The presence 
of infectious ZIKV particles in blood plasma was determined by plaque 
assay from days 0 to 6 after mouse infection. d, e, Immunoblockade of 
ZIKV NS1 in infected AG6 mice reduced the infection of fed A. aegypti 
(n = 6 mice per group pooled from 3 independent biological replicates).

Extended Data Figure 5 | Modelling the location of residue 188 of ZIKV 
NS1 and assessing NS1 dimer formation in cell lysates. a, Modelling 
the location of residue 188 of ZIKV NS1. Modelling was based on the 
ZIKV NS1 structure (PDB: 5K6K)30. Residue 188 is located within the 
interface of a NS1 dimer (contoured red), which is formed by hydrophobic 
interactions. Residue 188 is deep within the hydrophobic pocket formed 
by Trp210, Leu23, His299 and Leu231. b, Assessing NS1 dimer formation 
in the lysates of cells transfected with GZ01 or FSS13025 prM-E-NS1 
recombinant plasmids. The cell lysates, with or without heating treatment, 
were used for assessing NS1 monomers and dimers, respectively, by 
western blotting with an anti-V5 antibody. The experiment was repeated 
three times with similar results. For gel source data, see Supplementary 
Fig. 1.
