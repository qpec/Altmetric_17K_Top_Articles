Abstract
Problem: Sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts can both be used to identify sexual minority youth. Significant health disparities 
exist between sexual minority and nonsexual minority youth. However, not enough is known about health-related behaviors that 
contribute to negative health outcomes among sexual minority youth and how the prevalence of these health-related behaviors 
compare with the prevalence of health-related behaviors among nonsexual minorities.
Reporting Period: September 2014–December 2015.
Description of the System: The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health-
related behaviors among youth and young adults: 1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; 2) tobacco 
use; 3) alcohol and other drug use; 4) sexual behaviors related to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, 
including human immunodeficiency virus infection; 5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. In addition, YRBSS 
monitors the prevalence of obesity and asthma and other priority health-related behaviors. YRBSS includes a national school-
based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) conducted by CDC and state and large urban school district school-based YRBSs 
conducted by state and local education and health agencies. For the 2015 YRBSS cycle, a question to ascertain sexual identity 
and a question to ascertain sex of sexual contacts was added for the first time to the national YRBS questionnaire and to the 
standard YRBS questionnaire used by the states and large urban school districts as a starting point for their YRBS questionnaires. 
This report summarizes results for 118 health-related behaviors plus obesity, overweight, and asthma by sexual identity and sex 
of sexual contacts from the 2015 national survey, 25 state surveys, and 19 large urban school district surveys conducted among 
students in grades 9–12.
Results: Across the 18 violence-related risk behaviors nationwide, the prevalence of 16 was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual 
students than heterosexual students and the prevalence of 15 was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the 
same sex or with both sexes than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex. Across the 13 tobacco use-related 
risk behaviors, the prevalence of 11 was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than heterosexual students and the 
prevalence of 10 was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes than students who 
had sexual contact with only the opposite sex. Similarly, across the 19 alcohol or other drug use-related risk behaviors, the prevalence 
of 18 was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than 
heterosexual students and the prevalence of 17 was higher among 
students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with 
both sexes than students who had sexual contact with only the 
opposite sex. This pattern also was evident across the six sexual

Introduction
Sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts can both be used to 
identify sexual minority youth. Sexual minority youth include 
those who identify as gay, lesbian, and bisexual and those who 
are not sure about their sexual identity as well as those who 
have sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes. 
Dissonance between sexual identity and sex of sexual contact 
occurs, particularly among youth (1–7). Some youth who 
identify as heterosexual, gay, lesbian, or bisexual and some 
youth who are not sure of their sexual identity might not 
have had any sexual contact. Some youth who have had sexual 
contact with only the same sex or with both sexes might identify 
as heterosexual and some youth who have had sexual contact 
with only the opposite sex might identify as gay, lesbian, or 
bisexual or be not sure of their sexual identity. Sexual identity 
and sex of sexual contacts can change throughout the life span.
Significant health disparities exist between sexual minority 
and nonsexual minority youth (7,8). More specifically, 
violence, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, 
sexually transmitted infections, and pregnancy occur more 
frequently among sexual minority youth than nonsexual 
minority youth. In addition, some sexual minority youth 
struggle with stigma, discrimination, family disapproval, and 
social rejection. However, not enough is known about health-
related behaviors that contribute to negative health outcomes 
among sexual minority youth and how the prevalence of these 
health-related behaviors compare with the prevalence of health-
related behaviors among nonsexual minority youth (8).
CDC developed the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System 
(YRBSS) to monitor six categories of priority health-related 
behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of mortality 
and morbidity among youth and adults in the United States: 
1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and 
violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol and other drug use; 
4) sexual behaviors related to unintended pregnancy and 
sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV infection; 
5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. These 
behaviors frequently are interrelated and are established during 
childhood and adolescence and extend into adulthood. YRBSS 
also monitors obesity, overweight, asthma, and other priority 
health-related behaviors. YRBSS includes school-based national, 
state, and large urban school district Youth Risk Behavior 
Surveys (YRBS) conducted among representative samples of 
students in grades 9–12. Additional information about the 
YRBSS is available at http://www.cdc.gov/yrbs.
Since 1995, the need for data on the priority health-related 
behaviors of high school students by sexual minority subgroup 
has been recognized by an increasing number of states and large 
urban school districts (Table 1). With CDC support, these 
states and large urban school districts began adding at least one 
of two questions to their YRBS questionnaire to ascertain sexual 
identity and/or sex of sexual contacts and to generate estimates 
of priority health-related behaviors by sexual identity and sex 
of sexual contacts. For the 1997 YRBSS cycle, a question on 
sexual identity and a question on sex of sexual contacts were 
placed on the YRBS Optional Question List for the first time 
indicating CDC’s support for the use of these questions. Results 
from seven states and six large urban school districts that used 
these questions during 2001–2009 were then summarized in 
a previous MMWR Surveillance Summary (9). For the 2015 
YRBSS cycle, on the basis of substantial support from the 
state and large urban school district YRBS coordinators, the 
two questions ascertaining sexual minority status were added 
for the first time to the standard YRBS questionnaire used by 
the states and large urban school districts as a starting point 
for their YRBS questionnaires. The two questions also were 
added to the national YRBS questionnaire for the first time.
This report provides the first national estimates of the 
percentage of high school students who are gay, lesbian, 
and bisexual or are not sure of their sexual identity and the 
percentage of high school students who have had sexual contact 
risk behaviors. The prevalence of five of these behaviors was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than heterosexual 
students and the prevalence of four was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes 
than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex. No clear pattern of differences emerged for birth control use, 
dietary behaviors, and physical activity.
Interpretation: The majority of sexual minority students cope with the transition from childhood through adolescence to 
adulthood successfully and become healthy and productive adults. However, this report documents that sexual minority students 
have a higher prevalence of many health-risk behaviors compared with nonsexual minority students.
Public Health Action: To reduce the disparities in health-risk behaviors among sexual minority students, it is important to raise 
awareness of the problem; facilitate access to education, health care, and evidence-based interventions designed to address priority 
health-risk behaviors among sexual minority youth; and continue to implement YRBSS at the national, state, and large urban 
school district levels to document and monitor the effect of broad policy and programmatic interventions on the health-related 
behaviors of sexual minority youth.

with only the same sex or with both sexes. In addition, this 
report summarizes results for 118 health-related behaviors 
plus obesity, overweight, and asthma from the 2015 national 
YRBS by sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts. Results 
from 25 state and 19 large urban school district surveys that 
added at least one of the questions to ascertain sexual minority 
status and had weighted data for the 2015 YRBSS cycle also 
are included in this report. However, seven states (Colorado, 
Georgia, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin) and 
two large urban school districts (Chicago and Shelby County) 
that added at least one of the questions to ascertain sexual 
minority status, but had unweighted data, are not included 
in this report. Among the 25 states and 19 large urban school 
districts included in this report, two state and one large urban 
school district surveys were conducted during fall 2014; the 
national survey, 22 state, and 16 large urban school district 
surveys were conducted during spring 2015; and one state 
and two large urban school district surveys were conducted 
during fall 2015.
Methods
Detailed information about the methodology of the 
national, state, and large urban school district YRBSs has been 
described elsewhere (10). Information also is available at http://
www.cdc.gov/yrbs.
Sampling
National Youth Risk Behavior Survey
The sampling frame for the 2015 national YRBS consisted 
of all regular public* and private† schools with students in at 
least one of grades 9–12 in the 50 states and the District of 
Columbia. The sampling frame was based on the Market Data 
Retrieval (MDR) database (11), which includes information 
on both public and private schools, and the most recent 
data from the Common Core of Data from the National 
Center for Education Statistics (12). A three-stage cluster 
sample design produced a nationally representative sample of 
students in grades 9–12 who attend public and private schools. 
The first-stage sampling frame consisted of 1,259 primary 
sampling units (PSUs), consisting of counties, subareas of 
large counties, or groups of smaller, adjacent counties. The 
1,259 PSUs were categorized into 16 strata according to their 
metropolitan statistical area (MSA) status (e.g., urban city) 
and the percentages of black and Hispanic students in the 
PSUs. From the 1,259 PSUs, 54 were sampled with probability 
proportional to overall school enrollment size for the PSU.
In the second stage of sampling, 180 schools with any of 
grades 9–12 were sampled with probability proportional to 
school enrollment size from within the 54 PSUs. The third 
stage of sampling consisted of random sampling in each of 
grades 9–12, one or two classrooms from either a required 
subject (e.g., English or social studies) or a required period (e.g., 
homeroom or second period). All students in sampled classes 
were eligible to participate. Schools, classes, and students that 
refused to participate were not replaced.
State and Large Urban School District Youth Risk 
Behavior Surveys
In 2015, a two-stage cluster sample design was used to 
produce a representative sample of public§ school students in 
grades 9–12 in the 25 states and 19 large urban school districts 
that asked at least one of two questions to ascertain sexual 
minority status. In the first sampling stage, schools with any 
of grades 9–12 were sampled with probability proportional to 
school enrollment size in 23 states and three large urban school 
districts; all schools with any of grades 9–12 were invited to 
participate in two states and 16 large urban school districts. In 
the second sampling stage, intact classes from either a required 
subject (e.g., English or social studies) or a required period 
(e.g., homeroom or second period) were sampled randomly in 
24 states and 18 large urban school districts, and all students 
in the sampled classes were eligible to participate. In one state 
and one large urban school district, all students in sampled 
schools were eligible to participate.
Data Collection Procedures and 
Questionnaires
Survey procedures for the national, state, and large urban 
school district surveys were designed to protect students’ privacy 
by allowing for anonymous and voluntary participation. Before 
survey administration, local parental permission procedures 
were followed. Students completed the self-administered 
questionnaire during one class period and recorded their 
responses directly on a computer-scannable booklet or answer 
sheet. CDC’s Institutional Review Board approved the protocol 
for the national YRBS.
The 2015 standard YRBS questionnaire contained 89 
questions. This questionnaire was used as the starting point 
for the state and large urban school district questionnaires. 
* Might include charter schools and public alternative, special education, or 
vocational schools.
† Might include religious and other private schools, but does not include private 
alternative, special education, or vocational schools.
§ Includes regular public schools and might include charter schools; public 
alternative, special education, or vocational schools; and schools overseen by 
the Bureau of Indian Education.

States and large urban school districts could add and/or delete 
questions from the standard questionnaire. Only two states and 
three large urban school districts used the 2015 YRBS standard 
questionnaire without modifications. This report presents 
state and large urban school district results only from selected 
questions on the 2015 standard questionnaire.
The 2015 national YRBS questionnaire contained 
99 questions including all 89 questions on the standard 
questionnaire. This report presents national results (along 
with state and large urban school district results) for selected 
questions on the 2015 standard questionnaire, plus national 
only results from eight additional questions measuring usual 
method of marijuana use, ever use of hallucinogenic drugs, 
consumption of sports drinks, consumption of water, muscle 
strengthening exercises, indoor tanning device use, having had 
a sunburn, and avoidance of foods because eating the food 
could cause an allergic reaction.
Two questions on the standard questionnaire and national 
questionnaire measured sexual minority status. Sexual identity 
was ascertained with the following question: “Which of 
the following best describes you?” Response options were 
“heterosexual (straight),” “gay or lesbian,” “bisexual,” and “not 
sure.” All 25 states and 19 large urban school districts included 
this question. Sex of sexual contacts was ascertained with: 
“During your life, with whom have you had sexual contact?” 
Response options were “I have never had sexual contact,” 
“females,” “males,” and “females and males.” No definition 
was provided for sexual contact. All but two (Arizona and 
North Dakota) of the 25 states and all 19 large urban school 
districts included this question.
Except for six demographic questions (sex, grade in 
school, age, Hispanic ethnicity, race, and sexual identity) 
and three questions assessing height, weight, and asthma, 
all the remaining questions on the standard questionnaire 
and the national questionnaire measured behaviors practiced 
or experienced by the students (referred to as “behaviors”). 
Skip patterns, which occur when a particular response to one 
question indicates to the respondents that they should not 
answer one or more subsequent questions, were not included 
in any YRBS questionnaire to protect students’ privacy by 
ensuring all students took about the same amount of time 
to complete the questionnaire. All questions (except for two 
questions assessing height and weight and the race question) 
were multiple choice with a maximum of eight mutually 
exclusive response options and only one possible answer per 
respondent. Information about the reliability of the standard 
questionnaire has been published elsewhere (13). The wording 
of each question, including recall periods, response options, 
and operational definitions are available in the 2015 standard 
and national YRBS questionnaires at http://www.cdc.gov/yrbs.
Data Processing Procedures and 
Response Rates
For the 2015 national YRBS, 15,713 questionnaires were 
completed in 125 public and private schools. The national data 
set was cleaned and edited for inconsistencies. Missing data 
were not statistically imputed. Among the 15,713 completed 
questionnaires, 89 failed quality control¶ and were excluded 
from analysis, resulting in 15,624 usable questionnaires 
(Table 2). The school response rate was 69%, the students 
response rate was 86%, and the overall response rate was 60%**.
Data from each state and large urban school district survey 
were cleaned and edited for inconsistencies with the same 
procedures used for the national data set. The percentage 
of completed questionnaires that failed quality control 
checks and were excluded from analysis ranged from 0.2% 
to 5.3% (median: 0.8%) across the 25 states and from 0.3% 
to 6.4% (median: 1.6%) across the 19 large urban school 
districts. The student sample sizes ranged from 1,452 to 
55,596 (median: 2,899) across the states and from 1,052 to 
10,419 (median: 2,181) across the large urban school districts 
(Table 2). Among the states, the school response rates ranged 
from 70% to 100%, student response rates ranged from 66% 
to 90%, and overall response rates ranged from 60% to 82%. 
Among the large urban school districts, the school response 
rates ranged from 90% to 100%, student response rates ranged 
from 66% to 88%, and overall response rates ranged from 
64% to 88%.
To obtain a sufficient sample size for analyses of health-
related behaviors by sexual identity subgroups, students who 
selected “gay or lesbian” or “bisexual” were combined into a 
single subgroup and are referred to as “gay, lesbian, and bisexual 
students” as appropriate. Students who selected “heterosexual 
(straight)” are referred to as “heterosexual students” and 
students who selected “not sure” are referred to as “not sure 
students.” Sex of sexual contact was computed from “During 
your life, with whom have you had sexual contact?” and “What 
is your sex?” (response options were “female” and “male”). To 
obtain a sufficient sample size for analyses of health-related 
behaviors by sex of sexual contact subgroups, students who had 
sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes were 
combined into a single subgroup and are referred to as “students 
who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both 
sexes.” Students who had sexual contact with only the opposite 
sex are referred to as “students who had sexual contact with 
only the opposite sex.” Students who selected “I have never had

editing or has the same answer to ≥15 consecutive questions.

sampled schools) x (number of usable questionnaires/number of eligible 
students sampled).

sexual contact” are referred to as “students who had no sexual 
contact.” Students who had no sexual contact were excluded 
from analyses on sexual behaviors, female students who had 
sexual contact with only females were excluded from analyses 
on condom use and birth control use, and male students who 
had sexual contact with only males were excluded from analyses 
on birth control use.
Race/ethnicity was computed from two questions: 1) “Are 
you Hispanic or Latino?” (response options were “yes” 
and “no”), and 2) “What is your race?” (response options 
were “American Indian or Alaska Native,” “Asian,” “black 
or African American,” “Native Hawaiian or other Pacific 
Islander,” and “white”). For the second question, students 
could select more than one response option. For this report, 
students were classified as “Hispanic/ Latino” and are referred 
to as “Hispanic” if they answered “yes” to the first question, 
regardless of how they answered the second question. Students 
who answered “no” to the first question and selected only 
“black or African American” to the second question were 
classified as “black or African American” and are referred to as 
“black.” Students who answered “no” to the first question and 
selected only “white” to the second question were classified, 
and are referred to, as “white.” Race/ethnicity was classified 
as missing for students who did not answer the first question 
and for students who answered “no” to the first question but 
did not answer the second question.
Students were classified as having obesity or being overweight 
based on their body mass index (kg/m2) (BMI), which was 
calculated from self-reported height and weight. The BMI 
values were compared with sex- and age-specific reference data 
from the 2000 CDC growth charts (14). Obesity was defined 
as a BMI of ≥95th percentile for age and sex. Overweight was 
defined as a BMI of ≥85th percentile and <95th percentile for 
age and sex. These classifications are not intended to diagnose 
obesity or overweight in individual students, but to provide 
population-level estimates of obesity and overweight.
Weighting
For the national YRBS, a weight based on student sex, race/
ethnicity, and grade was applied to each record to adjust for 
school and student nonresponse and oversampling of black and 
Hispanic students. The overall weights were scaled so that the 
weighted count of students equals the total sample size, and 
the weighted proportions of students in each grade match the 
national population proportions. Therefore, weighted estimates 
are representative of all students in grades 9–12 attending 
public and private schools in the United States.
Data from states and large urban school districts that had a 
representative sample of students, appropriate documentation, 
and an overall response rate of ≥60% were weighted. A weight 
was applied to each record to adjust for school and student 
nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade, sex, 
and race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction, such that the weighted 
count of students equals the student population in each 
jurisdiction. Data from 25 states and 19 large urban school 
districts were weighted. The weighted prevalence estimates are 
representative of all students in grades 9–12 attending public 
schools in each jurisdiction.
Analytic Methods
Statistical analyses were conducted on weighted data using 
SAS (15) and SUDAAN (16) software to account for the 
complex sampling designs. Prevalence estimates and confidence 
intervals were computed for all variables and all data sets. In 
addition, for the national YRBS data, t tests (17) were used to 
determine pairwise differences between sexual identity and sex 
of sexual contact subgroups. Differences between prevalence 
estimates were considered statistically significant if the t test 
p value was <0.05 for main effects (sexual identity and sex of 
sexual contacts) and for interactions (sex by sexual identity, 
sexual identity by sex, sex by sex of sexual contacts, and sex of 
sexual contacts by sex). In the results section, only statistically 
significant differences in national YRBS prevalence estimates 
are reported in the following order: sexual identity, sex by 
sexual identity, sexual identity by sex, sex of sexual contacts, 
sex by sex of sexual contacts, and sex of sexual contacts by sex.

Nationwide, 88.8% of students identified as heterosexual, 
2.0% identified as gay or lesbian, 6.0% identified as bisexual, 
and 3.2% were not sure of their sexual identity (Table 3). 
Across 25 states, from 84.4% to 91.1% (median: 87.4%) 
of students identified as heterosexual, from 0.8% to 4.4%

than male students who had no sexual contact (10.1%).
The question this variable is based on was not included in 
the standard questionnaire used in the state and large urban 
school district surveys in 2015. Consequently, the range and 
median prevalence estimates across states and large urban 
school districts for the prevalence of avoiding foods because 
eating the food could cause an allergic reaction by sexual 
minority subgroups are not available.
Discussion
YRBSS has been measuring sexual identity and sex of sexual 
contacts at the state and local levels longer than any other 
public health surveillance system in the United States and has 
now generated the first national estimates of the size of sexual 
minority subgroups (as defined by sexual identity and sex of 
sexual contacts) among students in grades 9–12. Other large, 
national public health surveys (National Survey of Family 
Growth, National Health Interview Survey, National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the National Survey 
on Drug Use and Health) have published estimates of sexual 
identity subgroups and/or sex of sexual contact subgroups 
mostly for adults aged ≥18 years.
Although the majority of the 16,067,000 students estimated 
to be attending public and private schools in grades 9–12 
nationwide in 2015 (18) are heterosexual, this report indicates 
that approximately 321,000 are gay or lesbian, 964,000 are 
bisexual, and 514,000 are not sure of their sexual identity. In 
addition, approximately 273,000 of all students in grades 9–12 
have had sexual contact with only the same sex and 739,000 
have had sexual contact with both sexes. Sexual minority 
students are part of every community and are as racially, 
ethnically, socially, economically, and geographically diverse 
as their nonsexual minority peers.
Regardless of whether sexual identity or sex of sexual 
contacts is used to describe sexual minority students, this 
report documents that sexual minority students have a higher 
prevalence of many health-risk behaviors compared with 
nonsexual minority students. For example, across the 18 
violence-related risk behaviors nationwide, the prevalence of 
16 was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than 
heterosexual students and the prevalence of 15 was higher 
among students who had sexual contact with only the same 
sex or with both sexes than students who had sexual contact 
with only the opposite sex. For nine of these behaviors (did 
not go to school because of safety concerns; having ever been 
forced to have sexual intercourse; physical dating violence; 
sexual dating violence; having felt sad or hopeless; seriously 
considered attempting suicide; made a suicide plan; attempted 
suicide; and made a suicide attempt that resulted in an injury, 
poisoning, or overdose that had to be treated by a doctor or 
nurse), gay, lesbian, or bisexual students had a twofold or 
greater prevalence estimate than heterosexual students and for 
nine of these behaviors (injured in a physical fight; did not go 
to school because of safety concerns; having ever been forced 
to have sexual intercourse; physical dating violence; sexual 
dating violence; seriously considered attempting suicide; make 
a suicide plan; attempted suicide; and made a suicide attempt 
that resulted in an injury, poisoning, or overdose that had 
to be treated by a doctor or nurse) students who had sexual 
contact with only the same sex or with both sexes had a twofold 
or greater prevalence estimate than students who had sexual 
contact with only the opposite sex.
Across the 13 tobacco use-related risk behaviors, the 
prevalence of 11 was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual 
students than heterosexual students and the prevalence of 10 
was higher among students who had sexual contact with only 
the same sex or with both sexes than students who had sexual 
contact with only the opposite sex. For three of these behaviors 
(having smoked a whole cigarette before age 13 years, current 
frequent cigarette use, and current daily cigarette use) gay, 
lesbian, or bisexual students had a twofold or greater prevalence 
estimate than heterosexual students and for three of these 
behaviors (current frequent cigarette use, smoking more than 
10 cigarettes per day, and current daily cigarette use) students 
who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both 
sexes had a twofold or greater prevalence estimate than students 
who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex.
Similarly, across the 19 alcohol or other drug use-related 
risk behaviors, the prevalence of 18 was higher among gay,

lesbian, and bisexual students than heterosexual students 
and the prevalence of 17 was higher among students who 
had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes 
than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite 
sex. For nine of these behaviors (tried marijuana before age 
13 years, ever used hallucinogenic drugs, ever used cocaine, ever 
used ecstasy, ever used heroin, ever used methamphetamines, 
ever took steroids without a doctor’s prescription, ever used 
inhalants, and ever injected any illegal drug) gay, lesbian, or 
bisexual students had a twofold or greater prevalence estimate 
than heterosexual students and for seven of these behaviors 
(ever used cocaine, ever used ecstasy, ever used heroin, ever 
used methamphetamines, ever took steroids without a doctor’s 
prescription, ever used inhalants, and ever injected any illegal 
drug) students who had sexual contact with only the same 
sex or with both sexes had a twofold or greater prevalence 
estimate than students who had sexual contact with only the 
opposite sex.
The same pattern also was evident across the six sexual 
risk behaviors. The prevalence of five of these risk behaviors 
was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than 
heterosexual students and the prevalence of four was higher 
among students who had sexual contact with only the same 
sex or with both sexes than students who had sexual contact 
with only the opposite sex. For two of these risk behaviors 
(had sexual intercourse before aged 13 years and not using any 
method to prevent pregnancy) gay, lesbian, or bisexual students 
and students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or 
with both sexes had a twofold or greater prevalence estimate 
than heterosexual students and students who had sexual contact 
with only the opposite sex, respectively.
When the results were examined for male and female 
students separately, the same general patterns emerged for 
violence-related risk behaviors, tobacco use-related risk 
behaviors, alcohol or other drug use-related risk behaviors, and 
sexual risk behaviors. In contrast, no clear pattern of differences 
by sexual identity or sex of sexual contact subgroups overall 
or for male and female students separately emerged for birth 
control use, dietary behaviors, and physical activity. However, 
the prevalence of not drinking water and not participating in 
at least 60 minutes of physical activity on at least 1 day during 
the 7 days before the survey was twofold or greater among 
gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than heterosexual students.
This report also demonstrates that some students are not 
yet sure of their sexual identity. Not sure students and gay, 
lesbian, and bisexual students often have a similar prevalence 
of many health-risk behaviors and not sure students often 
have a higher prevalence of many health-risk behaviors than 
heterosexual students. For example, across the 18 violence-
related risk behaviors nationwide, the prevalence of 15 was 
higher among not sure students than heterosexual students and 
across the 19 alcohol or other drug use-related risk behaviors, 
the prevalence of 13 was higher among not sure students than 
heterosexual students.
Further, this report demonstrates that students who had no 
sexual contact have a much lower prevalance of most health-risk 
behaviors compared with students who had sexual contact with 
only the opposite sex and students who had sexual contact with 
only the same sex or with both sexes. For example, across the 
18 violence-related risk behaviors nationwide, the prevalence 
of all 18 was higher among students who had sexual contact 
with only the opposite sex and students who had sexual contact 
with only the same sex or with both sexes than students who 
had no sexual contact. Across the 13 tobacco use-related risk 
behaviors, the prevalence of all 13 was higher among students 
who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex and students 
who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both 
sexes than students who had no sexual contact. Similarly, 
across the 19 alcohol or other drug use-related risk behaviors, 
the prevalence of all 19 was higher among students who had 
sexual contact with only the opposite sex and students who 
had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes 
than students who had no sexual contact.
Comparison of Data Across Sites
Because all the state and large urban school district surveys 
share similar sampling designs, questionnaires, data collection 
strategies, and data processing procedures, YRBS data can be 
compared across the states and large urban school districts. 
Across states, a substantial difference (i.e., a range of 25 or 
more percentage points or a fivefold variation or greater) 
was identified for 17 behaviors among heterosexual students; 
38 behaviors among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students; 69 
behaviors among not sure students; 19 behaviors among 
students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex; 
41 behaviors for students who had sexual contact with only the 
same sex or with both sexes; and 27 behaviors for students who 
had no sexual contact. Across the large urban school districts, 
a substantial difference was identified for 18 behaviors among 
heterosexual students; 38 behaviors among gay, lesbian, and 
bisexual students; 58 behaviors among not sure students; 
15 behaviors among students who had sexual contact with 
only the opposite sex; 33 behaviors for students who had 
sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes; and 
25 behaviors for students who had no sexual contact. Only 
eight behaviors (having been electronically bullied, seriously 
considered attempting suicide, current marijuana use, ever took 
prescription drugs without a doctor’s prescription, having sexual 
intercourse with four or more persons during their life, eating

vegetables three or more times per day, not eating breakfast, 
and being physically active for at least 60 minutes per day 
on all 7 days) did not have a substantial difference across 
any of the sexual identity or sex of sexual contact subgroups 
among states or large urban school districts. The substantial 
differences across states and large urban school districts 
may reflect differences in state and local laws and policies, 
enforcement practices, access to drugs, availability of effective 
school and community interventions, prevailing behavioral and 
social norms (including attitudes toward sexual minorities), 
the amount of stigma and discrimination, demographic 
characteristics of the population, and adult practices and 
health-related behaviors. The differences also highlight how 
changes in one or more of these factors might contribute to 
reductions in health-risk behaviors within and across states and 
large urban school districts among students in grades 9–12.
Public Health Action
Most sexual minority students cope with the transition 
from childhood through adolescence to adulthood successfully 
and become healthy and productive adults. However, some 
sexual minority students struggle because of the disparities in 
health-related behaviors documented in this report, particularly 
violence-related behaviors and alcohol and other drug use, 
that can be compounded by stigma, discrimination, and 
homophobia. Because many health-related behaviors initiated 
during adolescence often extend into adulthood, they can 
potentially have a life-long negative effect on health outcomes, 
educational attainment, employment, housing, and overall 
quality of life.
Schools have a unique and important role to play in 
addressing the health-related behaviors of sexual minority 
students. In particular, schools can help reduce stigma and 
discrimination by creating and sustaining positive school 
environments which are associated with less suicide ideation 
and fewer suicide attempts, lower prevalence of substance use, 
and fewer school absences among sexual minority students 
(19–22). This might be accomplished through the following 
policies and practices:
• Encourage respect for all students and do not allow 
bullying, harassment, or violence against any student.
• Identify “safe spaces” (e.g., counselors’ offices, designated 
classrooms, or student organizations) where sexual 
minority students can get support from administrators, 
teachers, or other school staff.
• Encourage student-led and student-organized school clubs 
(e.g., gay/straight alliances) that promote school 
connectedness and a safe, welcoming, and accepting school 
environment for all students.
• Ensure that health classes and educational materials 
include information that is relevant to sexual minority 
students and use inclusive words or terms.
• Implement professional development opportunities and 
encourage all school staff to attend on how to create safe 
and supportive school environments for all students, 
regardless of sexual minority status.
• Make it easier for students to have access to community-based 
health care providers who have experience providing health 
services, including HIV/STD testing and counseling and 
social and psychological services, to sexual minority youth.
• Promote parent engagement through outreach efforts and 
educational programs that provide parents with the 
information and skills they need to help support sexual 
minority youth.
The 2014 School Health Policies and Practices Study 
(SHPPS) (23) indicates that nationwide during 2014, 21.5% of 
middle schools and 51.5% of high schools taught about sexual 
identity and sexual orientation as part of required instruction. 
In addition, 20.2% of middle schools and 34.6% of high 
schools provided health services specifically for gay, lesbian, and 
bisexual students and 17.7% of middle schools and 13.9% of 
high schools provided services specifically for gay, lesbian, and 
bisexual students through providers not on school property. 
Nationwide, 12.0% of school health services coordinators in 
elementary schools, 10.1% in middle schools, and 16.6% in 
high schools and 22.4% of school mental health and social 
services coordinators in elementary schools, 21.2% in middle 
schools, and 29.7% in high schools had received professional 
development on services specifically for gay, lesbian, and 
bisexual students during the 2 years before the study.
Schools address bullying through both policies and 
practices. According to SHPPS, nationwide in 2014, 98.5% 
of elementary, middle, and high schools had adopted a policy 
prohibiting bullying on school property; 90.7% had adopted 
a policy prohibiting bullying at off-campus, school-sponsored 
events; 91.2% had adopted a policy prohibiting electronic 
aggression or cyber-bullying on school property; and 84.8% 
had adopted a policy prohibiting electronic aggression or cyber-
bullying at off-campus, school-sponsored events. In addition, 
81.5% of elementary schools, 86.5% of middle schools, and 
66.2% of high schools had or participated in a program to 
prevent bullying.
School Health Profiles (Profiles) (24) provides additional 
information about how schools nationwide are addressing the 
health-related behaviors of sexual minority youth. Specifically 
in 2014, a median of 26.7% of middle and high schools 
across 47 states had a gay/straight alliance or similar club and 
a median of 61.4% of middle and high schools identified safe 
spaces where sexual minority students can receive support from

administrators, teachers, or other school staff. During 2008–
2014, in 15 of 37 states, significant increases were observed 
in the percentage of secondary schools having a gay/straight 
alliance or similar club, and in 26 of 36 states significant 
increases were observed in the percentage of secondary 
schools identifying safe spaces for sexual minority students. 
Nonetheless, these SHPPS and Profiles data demonstrate 
how much more schools could be doing to address the needs 
of sexual minority students and the health-risk behaviors 
they practice.
CDC provides funding and technical assistance to education 
agencies in 18 states and the District of Columbia and to 17 
large urban school districts to help schools implement effective 
policies and practices to reduce sexual risk behaviors among 
youth. These programs are focusing increasingly on sexual 
minority youth as part of their HIV, STD, and pregnancy 
prevention activities. Examples of program activities include: 
providing training for district and school staff to ensure that 
health curricula are inclusive of and relevant to sexual minority 
students, supporting schools in establishing gay/straight 
alliances and safe and supportive environments for sexual 
minority students, linking schools to community organizations 
that provide sexual health services for sexual minority youth, 
and developing resources to help school staff understand the 
special concerns and needs of sexual minority students. In 
addition, CDC provides funding and technical assistance to 
47 states and 21 large urban school districts to conduct YRBS.
State and local education and health agencies are using their 
YRBS data on sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts to inform 
a variety of policies and programs designed to help reduce health-
risk behaviors among sexual minority students. For example, the 
Connecticut State Department of Education used their YRBS 
data to identify the needs of populations that are disproportionally 
affected by HIV, other sexually transmitted infections, and teen 
pregnancy and help develop Guidelines for the Sexual Health 
Education Component of Comprehensive Health Education for 
local school districts on best practice policies, programs, and 
instruction in sexual health education. The Massachusetts 
Department of Elementary and Secondary Education used their 
YRBS data to describe the health-related needs of sexual minority 
youth and to support schools in modifying their sexual health 
curricula and lessons to make them more inclusive of all youth. 
The state reported that, as a result, differences between the percent 
of sexual minority youth and all other students who ever learned 
about HIV in school were reduced. In addition, YRBS data were 
used in a 2-day training of school counselors, social workers, and 
nurses to help them understand the risks faced by sexual minority 
youth in Massachusetts and how their support can help reduce 
those risks. The Vermont Department of Education used their 
YRBS data on sexual behaviors and sexual minority students in a 
series of data briefs to help inform educators and the community 
about the health-related needs of youth throughout the state. In 
the District of Columbia, the DC Concerned Providers Coalition 
used the District of Columbia YRBS data on sexual behaviors 
and sexual minority students to initiate development of a youth 
mentoring program for sexual minority youth and the District 
of Columbia Child and Family Services Agency used their YRBS 
data on sexual behaviors and sexual minority youth to support 
the development and implementation of a training program 
for working effectively with sexual minority youth involved in 
the foster care system. The District reported that the training 
program helped reduce complaints from sexual minority youth 
about unfair or insensitive care while in a placement. The School 
District of Philadelphia used their YRBS data on sexual minority 
youth to implement changes in professional development 
programs for teachers and other school staff to increase sensitivity 
and understanding of the issues facing sexual minority youth 
and to provide programming directly for students and parents. 
The San Diego Unified School District distributed their YRBS 
data on sexual minority students to superintendents, the Board 
of Directors, principals, and other key stakeholders to support 
sexuality education, sexual health services, and a revision to their 
sexual health education curriculum to include age-appropriate 
information and build support for gender minority students 
district-wide. San Francisco Unified School District used their 
YRBS data on sexual minority youth to support the creation of 
gay/straight alliances, encourage schools to implement activities 
during the school district’s LGBTQ Pride Month, assist in 
implementation of curricula inclusive of all students, create 
school-specific safer school strategies, and increase referrals to 
and collaboration with community-based organizations that 
serve sexual minority youth.
Limitations
The findings in this report are subject to at least eight 
limitations. First, these data apply only to youth who attend 
school and, therefore, are not representative of all persons 
in this age group. Nationwide, in 2012, of persons aged 
16–17 years, approximately 3% were not enrolled in a high 
school program and had not completed high school (25). 
Sexual minority youth might represent a disproportionate 
percentage of high school dropouts and other youths who 
are absent from or do not attend school (26). Second, the 
extent of underreporting or overreporting of health-related 
behaviors cannot be determined, although the survey questions 
demonstrate good test-retest reliability (10,13). Third, some 
students might not have known their sexual identity; might 
have been unwilling to disclose it on the YRBS questionnaire; 
 Surveillance Summaries
MMWR / August 12, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 9

might have been unwilling to label themselves as heterosexual, 
gay, lesbian, or bisexual; or might not have understood the 
sexual identity question. Although the “not sure” response 
option for the sexual identity question is a credible choice for 
youth who might truly be unsure of their sexual identity at 
this point in their lives, it is also possible that this response 
option was selected by students who did not know what the 
question or the other response options meant. Nonetheless, 
evidence that the words used to describe various types of sexual 
identity are unclear to youth is not available. Fourth, because 
no definition was provided for sexual contact, it is likely that 
students considered a range of sexual activities when responding 
to this question, possibly including involuntary activities. Fifth, 
the questions used to ascertain sexual minority status focused 
only on sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts. Questions 
focused on sexual attraction might have identified a different 
subgroup of sexual minority students and different estimates 
of health-related behaviors. Sixth, BMI is calculated on the 
basis of self-reported height and weight, and, therefore, tends 
to underestimate the prevalence of obesity and overweight (27). 
Seventh, not all states and large urban school districts included 
all of the standard questions on their YRBS questionnaire; 
therefore, data for certain variables are not available for some 
sites. Finally, these analyses are based on cross-sectional surveys 
and can only provide an indication of association, not causality.
Conclusions
To reduce the disparities in health-related behaviors 
experienced by sexual minority students, it is important to 
use this and other reports based on scientifically sound data to 
raise awareness about the prevalence of priority health-related 
behaviors among sexual minority students in grades 9–12 
among policy makers, the public, and a wide variety of agencies 
and organizations that work with youth. These agencies and 
organizations, including schools and youth-friendly health 
care providers, can help facilitate access to education, health 
care, and evidence-based interventions designed to address 
priority health-related behaviors among sexual minority 
youth. It is also important to continue to implement YRBSS 
at the national, state, and large urban school district levels 
to document and monitor the effect of broad policy and 
programmatic interventions on the health-related behaviors 
of sexual minority youth. In particular, more states could 
include questions on sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts 
on their YRBS questionnaire. Because sexual minority students 
represent a relatively small proportion of all students, use of 
large, population-based samples of students is key to obtaining 
the most generalizable and highest quality data on which to 
base policy and programmatic decisions that can help eliminate 
the health-related behavior disparities and improve health 
status, educational outcomes, and overall quality of life for 
sexual minority and all youth.
