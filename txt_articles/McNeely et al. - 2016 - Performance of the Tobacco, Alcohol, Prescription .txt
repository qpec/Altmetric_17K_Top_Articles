 Abstract
Background—Substance use is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality that is under-
identified in medical practice.
Objective—The Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription medication, and other Substance use (TAPS) 
Tool was developed to address the need for a brief screening and assessment instrument that 
includes all commonly used substances, and fits into clinical workflows. The goal of this study 
was to assess the performance of the TAPS Tool in primary care patients.
Design—Multi-site study conducted within the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials 
Network, comparing the TAPS Tool against a reference standard measure.
Setting—Five adult primary care clinics.
Participants—2,000 adult patients were consecutively recruited from clinic waiting areas.
Measurements—Interviewer- and self-administered versions of the TAPS Tool were compared 
to the reference standard modified Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), which 
measures problem use and substance use disorders (SUD).
Results—Interviewer- and self-administered versions of the TAPS Tool had similar diagnostic 
characteristics. For identifying problem use (at a cutoff of 1+), the TAPS Tool had sensitivity 0.93 
(95% CI 0.90–0.95) and specificity 0.87 (95% CI 0.85–0.89) for tobacco, and sensitivity 0.74 
(95% CI 0.70–0.78), specificity 0.79 (95% CI 0.76–0.81) for alcohol. For problem use of illicit 
and prescription drugs, sensitivity ranged from 0.82 (95% CI 0.76–0.87) for marijuana to 0.63 
(95% CI 0.47–0.78) for sedatives, and specificity was 0.93 or higher. For identifying any SUD, 
sensitivity was lower, but a score of 2+ greatly increased the likelihood of having a SUD.
Limitations—Low prevalence of some drug classes led to poor precision in some estimates. 
Research assistants were not blinded to the participant’s TAPS Tool responses when they 
administered the CIDI.
Conclusions—In a diverse population of adult primary care patients, the TAPS Tool detected 
clinically relevant problem substance use. While it may also detect tobacco, alcohol, and 
marijuana use disorders, further refinement is needed before the TAPS Tool can be broadly 
recommended as a screener for SUD.
Introduction
Tobacco and alcohol use are among the leading causes of preventable death in the US, (1, 2) 
and illicit substance use is a significant contributor to the HIV and opioid overdose 
epidemics(3, 4). Health care settings offer an opportunity to identify substance use and 
related problems, provide timely interventions, and link patients to treatment. Tobacco 
screening and treatment is a core clinical quality measure for primary care(5), and screening 
followed by brief intervention (BI) for unhealthy alcohol use is recommended by the United 
States Preventive Services Task Force(6–9). While the efficacy of BI for reducing drug use 
has not been clearly established(10–13), screening for substance use in medical settings may 
be clinically justified by the impact of substance use on the prevention and treatment of

 other medical conditions(14–16), and the potential for drug-medication interactions(17, 18) 
and overdose(19).
Primary care settings require a screening and assessment approach that is efficient, accurate, 
and informs clinical care(20–23). Very brief screening tools to efficiently identify alcohol 
and drug use have been developed(24–27), but they do not provide enough information 
about the specific substances used, or the patient’s risk level, to guide clinical actions. A 
structured substance use assessment can provide this information, but current options are 
either too lengthy(28), or do not provide sufficient detail(29, 30) to meet the needs of 
medical providers.
We developed the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription medication, and other Substance use 
(TAPS) Tool as a more optimal instrument for substance use screening in primary care 
settings. The TAPS Tool consists of a 4-item screen for tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs, and 
non-medical use of prescription drugs, followed by a substance-specific assessment of risk 
level for individuals who screen positive. The TAPS Tool has the flexibility to be 
administered face-to-face or self-administered using a tablet computer, to accommodate a 
variety of clinical workflows. The current paper presents the results from a large multi-site 
study conducted within the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) National Drug Abuse 
Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) to assess the performance of the TAPS Tool in 
comparison to a reference standard measure in adult primary care patients.
Methods
Participants & Recruitment
Participants were recruited from five primary care clinics located in Baltimore, MD; New 
York, NY; Richmond, VA; and two sites in Kannapolis, NC. Clinics were selected to provide 
a geographically diverse sample of urban and suburban participants, which would be 
expected to vary in their substance use patterns. A sample size of 2,000 was set prior to 
initiating recruitment, and sites enrolled competitively from August, 2014 to April, 2015, 
until the total sample was achieved. Sample size was determined through computer 
simulations to calculate the precision of the estimates of sensitivity and specificity as a 
function of the number of participants and substance use prevalence. We determined that a 
sample size of 2,000 allowed us to estimate sensitivity with precision (defined as 95th 
percentile of the half-width of the 95% confidence interval) of 12.5% for substances with a 
prevalence of 5%, up to 2.5% for substances with a prevalence of 50%.
Eligibility Criteria
Adults 18 years and older who were in clinic for a medical visit and able to provide 
informed consent were eligible to participate. Individuals were excluded if they were unable 
to comprehend spoken English, physically unable to complete the self-administered TAPS 
Tool, or previously enrolled in this study.

 Recruitment
Research assistants (RAs) consecutively approached each individual in the waiting area. 
Interested patients were screened for eligibility and provided verbal consent. Participants 
were given the option of having the study visit before their appointment if they had more 
than a 1-hour wait time, otherwise the study visit was done after the medical visit.
Study Procedures
Study visits were completed in a private room. Participants were assigned a unique identifier 
and informed that responses were confidential, and would not be shared with anyone in the 
clinic. The electronic data capture system randomly assigned half of the participants to begin 
with the self-administered TAPS Tool, and half to begin with the interviewer-administered 
TAPS Tool. After completing the TAPS Tool in the first format (e.g. self-administered), they 
completed it in the alternate format (e.g. interviewer). The self-administered version was 
delivered on a tablet computer (iPad®) that gave participants the option of hearing the 
questions and response options read verbatim by a recorded female voice. For the 
interviewer version, all questions and response options were read aloud by the RA. 
Following completion of both versions, the RA administered a questionnaire about the 
feasibility and acceptability of the TAPS Tool. This was followed by additional substance 
use measures that were collected for comparison purposes. RAs were not blinded to 
participant responses on the interviewer-administered TAPS Tool when they administered 
the reference standard measure (CIDI). After completing self-reported assessments, all 
participants were asked to provide verbal consent to participate in oral fluid testing for 
drugs. Individuals received $20 for the main study and an additional $10 for oral fluid 
testing. All study procedures were approved by local Institutional Review Boards (Duke 
University Health System, Friends Research Institute, New York University School of 
Medicine, and Virginia Commonwealth University).
Measures
Experimental instrument: TAPS Tool—The TAPS Tool was developed as a two-step 
screening and brief assessment tool from instruments that had not been validated. TAPS-1, 
the screening component, was adapted from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) 
Quick Screen V1.0.(31) TAPS-2, the brief assessment component, is a modified version of 
the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test-Lite (ASSIST-Lite).(32) 
A prototype of the TAPS Tool was evaluated using cognitive interviewing (33–35) with 30 
adult primary care patients from 3 of the study sites. Minor modifications to the wording of 
the TAPS Tool items were made based on these interviews, prior to finalizing the instrument 
that was used in this study.
The TAPS Tool is shown in Figure 1. The TAPS-1 asks about frequency of use in the past 12 
months of tobacco, alcohol above guideline-recommended daily limits (>5 drinks/day for 
men, >4 drinks/day for women),(36) illicit drugs, and non-medical use of prescription 
medications (sedatives, opioids, and stimulants). Respondents choose from five response 
options ranging from ‘never’ to ‘daily or almost daily.’ The TAPS-2 assesses use in the past 
three months of tobacco, alcohol, six different classes of illicit drugs, and ‘other’ drugs using 
McNeely et al.

 a yes/no format. When the answer is ‘yes’ to any use, the participant receives 2–3 follow-up 
items specific to that substance class.
For the TAPS-1, any response other than ‘never’ constitutes a positive screen. Those with a 
positive screen complete the corresponding items on the TAPS-2, and responses are summed 
within each substance class to generate a substance-specific risk score. TAPS Tool scores 
have a potential range of 0–3 for tobacco and other drugs, and 0–4 for alcohol. In clinical 
practice the TAPS-2 items would only be administered to those with a positive screen, but 
for the purposes of the study, participants completed all TAPS-2 items, regardless of their 
TAPS-1 responses.
Reference measures—The modified Composite International Diagnostic Interview, 
Second Edition, Substance Abuse Module (CIDI) was the ‘gold standard’ reference 
measure(37–41). The CIDI has been widely used in epidemiological and clinical research to 
assess substance use disorders (SUDs) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders (DSM), 4th edition. As in our previous research(42), we used the existing 
CIDI items that mapped onto the DSM-5 SUD classifications (by omiting the item on legal 
problems and including the CIDI item on craving).
Problem use was defined as past-year use with endorsement of one or more items on the 
CIDI. This approach has been used in prior screening tool studies to identify clinically 
important substance use that may not be severe enough to meet criteria for a SUD(42, 43). 
SUDs were defined using the standard diagnostic threshold of meeting two or more DSM 
criteria on the CIDI.
Oral Fluid Testing
The Intercept™ immunoassay (OraSure Technologies) provided an objective measure of 
point prevalence for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine, PCP, opiates, 
amphetamines, opiates, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates. It has a window of detection of 
up to 3 days for most drugs(44–46). To assist in interpretation of results, participants were 
assessed for medical use of medications that would be detected by the test. Oral fluid test 
results were not shared with participants, and were linked to the self-report data by the 
participant’s unique identifier.
Statistical Analysis
Concurrent validity of the interviewer-administered and self-administered versions of the 
TAPS Tool, in comparison to the reference standard CIDI, was assessed for the risk 
categories of problem use and SUD for each substance class. We calculated sensitivity, 
specificity, and positive and negative diagnostic likelihood ratios (LRs)(47), with exact 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs). There were 5 participants who did not complete the entire CIDI, 
and one participant who did not complete the entire interviewer-administered TAPS Tool. 
When the score for the CIDI or TAPS Tool was missing for a given substance, these cases 
were excluded from the analyses. For identification of problem use, we selected cutoffs that 
maximized sensitivity. For SUD, cutoffs were selected that were both higher than the cutoff 
for problem use and had highest sensitivity.

 To assess for differences based on order of administration of the TAPS Tool, we examined 
differences in prevalence for each substance related to order of administration and 
instrument (self-administered vs interviewer-administered) using a generalized estimating 
equation (GEE) approach.(48, 49) A two-way crossed model was fit, and to account for the 
crossover nature of the data, an unstructured working correlation matrix was used under the 
GEE framework. The most important parameter of interest was the interaction between order 
and instrument. This variable was highly significant for alcohol, suggesting there is a 
difference in the participant responses to self-administered and interviewer-administered 
TAPS tool due to order of administration. Reporting of alcohol use was higher (38.6%) 
among participants who had the self-administered tool first, compared to participants who 
had the self-administered tool second (30.7%). For substances other than alcohol, analyses 
of diagnostic accuracy were conducted without regard to order of administration. For 
alcohol, analyses were also conducted separately, restricted to the first version received (see 
Supplementary Tables 3a and 3b). All analyses were conducted in SAS® version 9.3 or 9.4.
Role of the funding source—The study was supported by a National Institute on Drug 
Abuse (NIDA) Center for Clinical Trials Network (CCTN) Cooperative Agreement. Co-
authors include NIDA CCTN staff (GS and CC), who contributed to protocol development 
including study design and methods, conduct, and the preparation of the manuscript.
RESULTS
Participants
A total of 12,473 individuals were assessed for eligibility, of which 48% were eligible for 
participation (Figure 2). Among those eligible, 35% agreed to participate and were 
randomized. Of the 2,000 participants who completed the measures, 1,802 (90%) 
subsequently agreed to oral fluid testing.
As shown in Table 1, the mean (SD) age of the participants was 46.0 (14.7) and more than 
half (56.2%) were women. The prevalence of past-year use, as reported on the modified 
CIDI, is shown in Table 2. Among the participants who provided a sample for oral fluid 
testing, point prevalence was 11.3% for illicit substances, and 5.0% for non-medical use of 
prescription medications.
Acceptability of the TAPS Tool
The vast majority (99%) of participants said they felt comfortable answering the TAPS Tool 
questions, and said they would be comfortable sharing the results with their doctor (95%). 
Participants differed in their preferences for interviewer-versus self-administered screening: 
24% preferred the iPad, 31% preferred the interview, and 45% had no preference.
Comparison of Interviewer and Self-administered versions
Overall, the interviewer-administered and self-administered versions of the TAPS Tool 
performed similarly, and generated the same cutoffs for problem use and SUD. Because they 
generated similar results, only the interviewer-administered version is presented in Table 3, 
while data for the self-administered version is in Supplemental Table 2. Small differences in

 sensitivity were observed, but they did not follow a consistent pattern. Specificity was 
almost uniformly high across substance classes, for both versions.
Identification of problem use (Table 3)
The optimal cutoff score for problem use was 1+. At this cutoff, the interviewer-
administered TAPS Tool had good sensitivity and specificity for identifying any problem use 
of tobacco (0.93 and 0.87, respectively) and alcohol (0.74 and 0.79, respectively). For illicit 
drugs, sensitivity ranged from 0.82 (marijuana) to 0.68 (cocaine). For non-medical use of 
prescription drugs, sensitivity was 0.71 for opiates and 0.63 for sedatives. The 95% 
confidence intervals were broad for substances with lower prevalence in the study 
population. Specificity for identifying problem use was high (0.93 or greater) for all illicit 
and prescription drug classes. Positive LRs ranged from 3.5 for tobacco to over 250 for 
heroin, while negative LRs ranged from 0.08 for tobacco to 0.37 for sedatives.
Identification of substance use disorder (Table 3)
The optimal cutoff score on the TAPS Tool for identifying SUD was 2+. A lower cutoff of 
1+ had higher sensitivity for identifying SUD, but because this was the optimal cutoff for 
problem use, it was not selected. Conversely, a higher cutoff of 3 demonstrated high 
specificity for identifying SUDs, but was not selected due to unacceptably low sensitivity 
(<0.50). At a score of 2+, sensitivities were lower for identification of SUD than for problem 
use (although they were 0.70 or greater for tobacco, alcohol and marijuana), and specificities 
were no lower than 0.85. Positive LRs ranged from 4.7 to over 990, and negative LRs ranged 
from 0.30 to 0.52. The small number of participants with prescription stimulant use, (7 with 
problem use and 4 with SUD were identified on the CIDI), did not allow us to make 
meaningful estimates for this substance class.
DISCUSSION
This multi-site study of a substance use screening instrument found that for those substances 
that are most commonly used by primary care patients (i.e. tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana), 
the TAPS Tool has good sensitivity and specificity for identifying problem use. For 
substances that are less frequently encountered in primary care, sensitivity and specificity 
estimates were lower and less precise, and sensitivity for detection of SUD was 
unacceptably low. Thus, while the TAPS Tool cutoffs of 1+ for problem use and 2+ for SUD 
can be applied for alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana, for other drugs, any patient with a score 
of 1+ should be further assessed for presence of a SUD.
In comparison to other substance use screening instruments, the TAPS Tool has several 
characteristics that make it attractive for primary care. First, the TAPS Tool screens and 
assesses tobacco, alcohol, and all major drug classes in a single instrument. It has the 
potential to be easily integrated into regular clinical workflows, which in most settings have 
already been designed to screen for tobacco use (required under Meaningful Use Stage 
2(50)). Second, the TAPS Tool gives substance-specific risk information, which is essential 
for ensuring patient safety, providing feedback and education, and guiding treatment 
decisions. Neither the widely-used Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10)(25, 51) nor the

 newer Screen of Drug Use (SoDU)(29) provides this level of detail. Third, the TAPS Tool 
provides the option of a patient self-administered format, which can facilitate more accurate 
reporting of stigmatized behavior(52, 53), ensure fidelity of administration(54, 55), increase 
patient comfort(56), and reduce the burden on staff. It has the potential to be completed 
through a web-based patient portal, or on a kiosk or tablet computer in the clinic, that would 
upload screening results into the electronic health record.
In some practice settings, there may still be a role for very brief screeners (e.g. Substance 
Use Brief Screen (SUBS)(27), or single-item screening questions (SISQs) for alcohol and 
drugs(24–26)) to quickly identify patients with any unhealthy substance use. The four-item 
TAPS-1 screener could potentially accomplish this, and future reports will examine its 
performance as a stand-alone instrument. Yet, for the significant proportion of patients who 
are positive on a brief screener (28–29% in some studies(26, 27)), it is essential to have an 
efficient follow-up assessment that can risk-stratify patients and guide care. For alcohol, this 
can be accomplished with the AUDIT or AUDIT-C, which have been widely adopted(36, 43, 
57, 58). There has been no similarly brief structured assessment tool for other drugs. Until 
now, the WHO ASSIST has been the only screening tool that provides substance-specific 
risk stratification for drugs, but its length and complexity has hindered its implementation in 
primary care settings(32, 59), (though a computer self-administered version could be more 
feasible(60)). The TAPS Tool streamlines the ASSIST to perform this assessment relatively 
quickly. Future research may explore whether the TAPS-2 could be simplified even further, 
either by reducing either the number of substances queried or the number of items.
The TAPS Tool has some shortcomings. Sensitivity was low for detecting problem use of 
some substances. It is possible that this reflects differences between the timeframe of our 
reference standard measure and the TAPS Tool. Although the TAPS Tool screens for use in 
the past 12 months (TAPS-1), the final score is based on use in the past 3 months (TAPS-2). 
As a result, the TAPS Tool could fail to identify individuals who had problem use in the past 
year that had not continued into the most recent 3-month period. However, by focusing on 
current use, the TAPS Tool identifies those patients who are most in need of clinical 
intervention, which is important in primary care settings where providers have multiple 
demands on their time. We have limited ability to draw comparisons with other instruments 
that screen for illicit and prescription drug use, because only the ASSIST, (and its shortened 
version the ASSIST-Lite), provide substance-specific results. Validation studies of the 
ASSIST have not reported its diagnostic accuracy at the WHO-recommended cutoffs, and 
were conducted in samples that included drug treatment and psychiatric patients(28, 61, 62). 
The ASSIST-Lite (on which the TAPS-2 is based) was developed from secondary analysis of 
data from the validation study of the full ASSIST(32), and its performance has not been 
previously assessed.
Performance of the TAPS Tool for detecting problem use and SUD was lowest for 
prescription medications, particularly on the self-administered version, but still compares 
favorably to an existing brief screening tool that specifically queries non-medical use of 
prescription drugs(27). The relatively low sensitivity of screening for this substance class 
could be due to confusion among participants about what constitutes non-medical use(63), 
poor comprehension, or question fatigue due to the length and complexity of these items on 
McNeely et al.

 the TAPS-1. The variability in how non-medical use is described in the TAPS-1 versus the 
TAPS-2 could have confused some respondents. In practice, performance of the TAPS and 
similar screening tools may be further compromised by patients’ reluctance to disclose 
misuse of a medication to the physician who is prescribing it.
Interviewer-administered screening approaches can be challenging to implement in practice 
because they require staff time and training, and interviewers may modify the screening 
language in ways that compromise the tool’s accuracy(54, 64). Self-administered tools could 
help to promote disclosure of substance use(52, 53, 65–67), but this format may not be 
feasible in all practice settings. Self-administration on an iPad could be problematic in 
patients with low literacy or poor vision, though the audio guidance can help to address 
these barriers. Elderly patients may have difficulty using an iPad. Tablet computers are 
currently uncommon in primary care settings, and their use would require considerations for 
workflow, security, and hygiene.
Our study design has several limitations. Although our sample was large, for most drug 
classes we did not have enough participants with problem use or SUD to develop and then 
test the cutoffs in separate samples. The low prevalence of certain drugs also led to poor 
precision in some estimates, particularly with respect to identifying a SUD. RAs 
administering the CIDI were not blinded to participant responses on the interviewer-
administered TAPS Tool, which could potentially bias the CIDI responses. Our analyses 
relied on self-reported substance use, which has consistently shown good accuracy in 
research studies(68–71), but nonetheless depends on accurate and truthful disclosure of use. 
Data were collected with an assurance of confidentiality and anonymity, as they have been 
for all prior studies examining the concurrent validity of substance use screening tools, to 
increase the accuracy of self-report. In clinical practice, where patients are aware that 
medical providers will view their screening results, the diagnostic accuracy of the TAPS 
Tool might be expected to differ(54, 56, 69, 72).
The TAPS Tool was developed and evaluated only in English, which may limit its 
application in some settings. Though we recruited from clinics that had geographic and 
demographic diversity, our participants may not be representative of patients seen in all 
primary care settings. In particular, we had a high proportion of African-Americans and 
individuals with lower levels of education in our sample. Many eligible patients declined to 
participate in the study, and we are unable to assess how their inclusion would have 
impacted the performance of the TAPS Tool. Our study also has notable strengths, including 
enrollment of a large and diverse sample of adult primary care patients, high rates of 
completion of the reference standard measures, and a rigorous approach to testing both a 
self-administered and interviewer-administered version of the TAPS Tool.
Conclusion
Having information about a patient’s substance use is essential for ensuring the quality and 
safety of medical care. This study supports the use of the TAPS Tool (at a cutoff of 1+) in 
screening primary care patients for problem substance use. It may also detect alcohol, 
tobacco, and marijuana use disorders, although further refinement is needed before it can be 
broadly recommended as a screener for SUD. Because it identifies problem use of all

 commonly used substances with a limited number of questions, and has the flexibility to be 
either self-administered or completed as an interview, the TAPS Tool has the potential to 
ease barriers to incorporating substance screening into busy clinical environments.

Notes to Table 3. CI = Confidence Interval; LR=Likelihood Ratio; CIDI = Composite International Diagnostic Interview Composite Index; TAPS = Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription medication, and other 
Substance use
There were 5 participants who did not complete the entire CIDI, and one participant who did not complete the entire interviewer-administered TAPS Tool. Therefore, when the score for CIDI or TAPS Tool 
is missing for a given drug, these cases were excluded from the analyses.
