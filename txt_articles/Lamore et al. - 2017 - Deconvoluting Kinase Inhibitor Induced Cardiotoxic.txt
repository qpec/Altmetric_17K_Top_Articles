ABSTRACT
Many drugs designed to inhibit kinases have their clinical utility limited by cardiotoxicity-related label warnings or
prescribing restrictions. While this liability is widely recognized, designing safer kinase inhibitors (KI) requires knowledge of
the causative kinase(s). Efforts to unravel the kinases have encountered pharmacology with nearly prohibitive complexity.
At therapeutically relevant concentrations, KIs show promiscuity distributed across the kinome. Here, to overcome this
complexity, 65 KIs with known kinome-scale polypharmacology profiles were assessed for effects on cardiomyocyte (CM)
beating. Changes in human iPSC-CM beat rate and amplitude were measured using label-free cellular impedance.
Correlations between beat effects and kinase inhibition profiles were mined by computation analysis (Matthews Correlation
Coefficient) to identify associated kinases. Thirty kinases met criteria of having (1) pharmacological inhibition correlated with
CM beat changes, (2) expression in both human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and adult heart tissue,
and (3) effects on CM beating following single gene knockdown. A subset of these 30 kinases were selected for mechanistic
follow up. Examples of kinases regulating processes spanning the excitation–contraction cascade were identified, including
calcium flux (RPS6KA3, IKBKE) and action potential duration (MAP4K2). Finally, a simple model was created to predict
functional cardiotoxicity whereby inactivity at three sentinel kinases (RPS6KB1, FAK, STK35) showed exceptional accuracy in
vitro and translated to clinical KI safety data. For drug discovery, identifying causative kinases and introducing a predictive
model should transform the ability to design safer KI medicines. For cardiovascular biology, discovering kinases previously
unrecognized as influencing cardiovascular biology should stimulate investigation of underappreciated signaling pathways.
Key words: cardiotoxicity; kinase; kinase inhibitor; cellular impedance.

 Because kinases play a critical role in regulating diverse human
biology, their modulation has become a mainstay for pharmaceu-
tical discovery particularly for treating cancer (Wu et al., 2015).
More than 25 small molecule kinase inhibitor (SMKI) drugs are
now approved (Wu et al., 2015), yet many have cardiac liabilities
requiring label warnings (Bellinger et al., 2015; Fabbro et al., 2012;
Orphanos
et
al.,
2009;
and
Supplementary
References).
Cardiotoxicity is also a cause for SMKI failure in clinical develop-
ment (Ho et al., 2011) and preclinical discovery (Lim et al., 2011).
Thus, the current preclinical testing cascades need supplemental
tools to help mitigate cardiotoxicity. In principle, understanding
the particular kinase(s) that cause cardiotoxicity could allow ra-
tional design of safer drugs. Unfortunately, SMKI are notoriously
promiscuous and this polypharmacology has been too complex
to unravel within a single drug discovery program.
A dedicated study to deconvolute kinases contributing to
functional cardiotoxicity has been prohibited by at least one of
three hurdles. First, the human genome encodes 518 protein ki-
nases, 478 of which belong to the “typical” (or “eukaryotic”) su-
perfamily with a conserved catalytic domain (Manning et al.,
2002). The highly conserved ATP binding is the site of interac-
tion for the majority of SMKI. This creates polypharmacology
with
kinome-scale
complexity
thereby
requiring
higher
throughput assays and large data sets to deconvolute. Second,
kinases modulate cardiac function by coordinated regulation of
proteins involved in the action potential, calcium flux, and me-
chanical contraction (Bers, 2002). This necessitates functional
assays that are sensitive to endpoints downstream in the exci-
tation–contraction signaling cascade to capture diverse kinase
effects on excitation, calcium flux and contraction. Third, inter-
species variation in kinases raises the possibility that kinase in-
hibitor
polypharmacology
profiles
will
also
vary
between
species. It follows that both human kinome pharmacology pro-
files and human functional assays are needed to align in vitro
data with clinical cardiotoxicity. Thus, while existing cardiotox-
icity assays perform well for most drug classes, they lack the
throughput, downstream functional readout, and/or human ba-
sis
that
is
required
for
unraveling
mechanisms
of
SMKI
cardiotoxicity.
Recent advances have addressed each of these three hur-
dles. Kinase selectivity profiles across the majority of human
kinome have been publicly disclosed for diverse sets of com-
pounds (Anastassiadis et al., 2011; Davis et al., 2011). These data
sets are now larger than the proprietary sets used to success-
fully generate predictive models of SMKI-induced chromosomal
damage (Olaharski et al., 2009) and bone marrow toxicity
(Olaharski et al., 2010). Advances in stem cell biology and cell
manufacturing have enabled abundant quantities of human in-
duced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC
CM), making human cell-based cardiotoxicity screening a prac-
tical option. Finally, impedance-based assays with hiPSC CM
have proven highly predictive for each of the leading functional
cardiotoxicity hazards including arrhythmia (hERG and non-
hERG related), chronotropy, inotropy, and KI induced functional
cardiotoxicity (Guo et al., 2013; Lamore et al., 2013; Peters et al.,
2015; Scott et al., 2014).
The present study tests a large panel of SMKI for effects on
human CM beating and mines their kinome-scale pharmacol-
ogy profiles for correlations with the aim of achieving two inde-
pendent but complementary goals. First, can kinase(s) whose
inhibition alters CM function be discovered, thereby providing a
mechanistic basis for future studies? Second, can a predictive
model be developed that flags compounds based on kinase inhi-
bition profiles for earlier testing and refinement?
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture. iCell Cardiomyocytes (cat #CMC-100-010, Cellular
Dynamics International, Madison, Wisconsin) were thawed
according to the manufacturer’s suggestion and plated in 96-
well xCELLigence Cardio E-plates (ACEA Biosciences, San Diego,
California) coated with fibronectin (10 mg/ml in DPBS; cat #
F1114, Sigma, St Louis, Missouri) at 30 000 plateable cells per
well. Cells were cultured at 7% CO2 and 37 �C for twelve days
prior
to
experimentation.
The
maintenance
medium
was
changed every 48 h and also 4 h prior to drug addition.
Drug source preparation and addition. Compounds were obtained
from
EMD
Millipore
(Billerica,
Massachusetts),
Tocris
Biosciences (Bristol, UK), Selleck Chemicals (Houston, Texas), or
were synthesized at AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals. Compound
stock solutions (1000 � g) were prepared in DMSO. hiPSC-CM
were treated with compound in a final concentration of 0.1%
DMSO or 0.1% DMSO as a vehicle control. Because temperature
decreases reduce CM beat rates, liquid handling steps were
automated on a BioMek FX in order to minimize the time that
cell cultures were out of the incubator to fewer than 90 s.
Measurement of beat rate and amplitude as determined by cellular
impedance recordings. Cellular impedance was selected as the
detection method because it provides high throughput and exqui-
site sensitivity to changes in cell morphology although it does not
quantitate contractile force. Impedance data were collected with
the xCELLigence Cardio System instrument (ACEA Biosciences,
92121 San Diego, California) with three consecutive 58 s reads sep-
arated by 2 s intervals. SMKI responses were collected at single
time, 2 h postdrug addition. In Excel, data were transformed first
to percent of baseline for each well and subsequently to percent
of time-matched vehicle control. Data were then exported to
Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California) for graphing and
statistical analysis. Data are representative of at least three inde-
pendent experiments. To ensure robust assessment of cytotoxic-
ity, cellular ATP levels were measured 24 h postdrug addition. Cell
index (measured as the relative change in impedance), which is
dependent on cell attachment and viability, was also measured
24 h postdrug addition or 72 h post siRNA transfection.
Quantification of cellular ATP levels. ATP content was determined
using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent assay (Promega, Madison,
Wisconsin) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All but
75 ml of cell culture supernatant was removed from each well
and an equal volume of CellTiter-Glo reagent was added. Plates
were shaken for 1 min, incubated at ambient temperature for
10 min and 125 ml was transferred to a white-walled 96 well
plate (Costar, Corning, New York). Luminescence was recorded
on a Victor Light Luminescence Counter (PerkinElmer, Santa
Clara, California). Data are representative of at least three inde-
pendent experiments.
Method to assess the co-variability of two variables. Because the
underlying distributions of the variables in these data sets are
unknown the statistical significance was quantified by sam-
pling. For each pair of variables (v1, v2) the Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC; Baldi et al., 2000) was calculated with respect
to v1 using the n examples tested. MCC is widely used in
machine learning approaches to compare models with binary
data where the two classes differ in size. It is a balanced meas-
ure that takes into account both true and false positives and
negatives, which makes the measure less biased toward the

 majority class. MCC values range from -1 to þ1, where þ1 indi-
cates perfect positive prediction, 0 indicates no better than ran-
dom prediction, and -1 indicates perfect inverse prediction. To
evaluate if the obtained correlation was significantly different
from what could be expected from a random correlation, m
samples with length n where drawn from v2 and MCC was cal-
culated with respect to v1 for each sample. This resulted in an
estimate of the distribution describing the random co-variation
between v1 and a random variable with the same outcome as v2.
By sorting the sampled MCC values, a two sided 90% confidence
interval (CI) was calculated by retrieving the MCC from the
0.05*m:th position in the ordered list as well as the value of
the .95*m:th position. A P-value was also calculated by counting
the number of MCCs more extreme than the observed MCC for
v2 and dividing by m. To easily rank and compare the co-
variation of the variables an enrichment factor, which incorpo-
rates information about both magnitude (MCC) and statistical
significance (CI) of the correlation, was calculated. The enrich-
ment factor was defined as the obtained MCC for v2 divided by
the largest limit of the CI with the same sign, thus for positive
v2 MCCs the upper 90% CI limit was used. This ordering was
used to rank the co-variation and thus the importance of the
individual variables. This method was applied to the analysis of
correlation between functional beat changes and individual kin-
ases as well as the importance of kinase groups.
Assessment of correlation between functional beat changes and indi-
vidual kinases. The categorical data set described in “Assessment
of correlation between functional beat changes and kinase
groups” (see below) was used to assess the correlation between
specific kinases and beat response. The correlation between
effects on CM beating and kinase inhibition was assessed as
described in “Method to assess the co-variability of two varia-
bles”. Because the underlying distribution of the kinase data is
unknown it was important to use a methodology that does not
assume any underlying distribution of the variables. The co-
variability of beat response and kinase inhibition was evaluated
by MCC, P-value, and enrichment (see “Method to assess the co-
variability of two variables”).
Kinase gene expression obtained from GEO. Kinase gene expression
data were obtained from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO
dataset record number GSE35671: sample numbers GSM873327-9
and GSM873336-8 for adult heart samples; GSM873330-2 for left
ventricular sample; and GSM873300-2 for hiPSC 45 days after ini-
tiation of differentiation; Babiarz et al., 2012).
siRNA-mediated
gene
knockdown.
iCell
Cardiomyocytes
were
thawed into 96-well xCELLigence Cardio E-plates and cultured
as described in “Cell culture”. Ten days postthaw, cells were
transiently transfected with a pool of four small interfering RNA
(siRNA) oligonucleotides (oligos) targeting the specific gene of
interest (see Supplementary Table 2) or 20–100 nM of non-tar-
geting siRNA oligos (siControl; D-001210-01) using DharmaFECT
1 transfection reagent (0.4 ml/well; Thermo Fisher Scientific). For
each transfection, a siRNA oligo stock and a Dharmafect 1 stock
were prepared in Optimem (Life Technologies) and incubated
separately for 5 min. The two stocks were then mixed and incu-
bated for approximately 30 min. iCell Cardiomyocyte mainte-
nance medium (without antibiotics) was added to the mixture
and 100 ml was added to each well. Following a 6 h incubation,
transfection medium was removed and replaced with fresh
maintenance medium. Data are representative of at least three
independent experiments.
Quantitative RT-PCR. Quantitative reverse transcription polymer-
ase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed using the Ambion
Gene
Expression
Cells-to-CT
kit
from
Life
Technologies
(Carlsbad, California) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Cells were lysed and cDNA was synthesized using the
provided reverse transcriptase. Quantitative PCR was performed
using an Applied Biosystems 7900HT SDS instrument (Life
Technologies) with the following cycling conditions: 50 �C for
2 min, 95 �C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 �C for 15 s
alternating
with 60 �C for 1 min. PCR reactions
contained
TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, nuclease free water, VIC-
labeled glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (assay ID Hs02758991_g1) as
endogenous control, and FAM-labeled TaqMan Gene Expression
Assays specific to the gene of interest (see Supplementary Table
2). For each sample, gene-specific product was normalized to
GAPDH and quantified using the comparative Ct (DDCt) method.
Data
are
representative
of
at
least
three
independent
experiments.
Assessment of correlation between functional beat changes and kinase
groups. A categorical data set was devised where both beat
response and kinase inhibition were categorized into binary
variables. Significant effects on CM beating were defined by
changes in beat rate or amplitude >3 * standard deviation (SD)
of the vehicle-treated group. For each of the 65 inhibitors, the
beat response separates alteration in beat rate or amplitude
from no alteration (ie, “effect” vs “no effect”). For kinase inhibi-
tion, the variable separates > 50% binding at 3 mM (active)
from <50% (inactive). This results in a binary matrix with inhibi-
tor and associated beat response versus kinase assays. In addi-
tion, all kinases were labeled with their respective kinase group
(Manning et al., 2002). The Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (Toutenburg
1975), a non-parametric test that thus can be used without
assuming an underlying distribution of the variables, was used
to assess if kinase groups could be used to identify inhibitors
that affect beat response. Within each kinase group the sum of
active kinases was calculated for each compound in the data
set. The data were separated into two sets, active and inactive
with respect to the beat response. The null hypothesis was that
there was no difference in the number of active kinases within
a group between the active and inactive compounds. For each
kinase group the low limit of the CI for the estimated shift from
the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to separate predicted
active and inactive compounds. Comparing the predicted classi-
fication to the beat response for each compound resulted in a
contingency table for each kinase group. The MCC, P-value, and
enrichment were calculated from these contingency tables (see
“Method to assess the covariability of two variables”). Wilcoxon
Rank Sum calculations were made using R (The R Project for
Statistical Computing, version 2.5.0, 2007).
Recursive partitioning analysis. Categorical data as described
above were analyzed for kinase activity correlations with altera-
tions in beat activity using the Recursive Partitioning function
in JMP (SAS Institute, Inc). The y variable was set to the beat
activity and the kinase categorical activities were assessed for
their contribution to that activity. Because of the low number of
actives in the dataset, the minimum split size was set at 3.
In vitro kinase assays. Competition binding assays were per-
formed with human enzymes using the KinomeScan profiling
service (KinomeScan, a division of DiscoveRx, San Diego,
California). The selectivity profile of the internal set of 102

 AstraZeneca compounds was evaluated at a concentration of
1 mM. Clinically tested SMKI (Table 5) were evaluated against
RPS6KB1, FAK, and STK35 at four different concentrations, cen-
tered around human Cmaxss values, and IC50s were estimated
from a four point concentration–response curve.
Measurements of action potential, intracellular Ca21 and contraction.
Human iPS-CM were transiently loaded with 6 lM di-4-ANEPPS
(Biotium Ref. 61010) in serum-free media (DMEM Gibco #11966,
10mM Galactose, 1 mM Na-Pyruvate). The media containing the
dye was replaced by fresh serum free media and kept in this con-
dition throughout the experiment. Intracellular Ca2þ was meas-
ured
after
Fura4-AM
incubation
(Molecular
Probes
Ref.
F14201 3 lM, 30 min incubation, 37 �C). Cell contractility was
assessed using 10 s of recorded video using a Hammatsu Flash4
camera recorded at 100 Hz. The cell motion was analyzed using a
previously established method (Hortigon-Vinagre et al., 2016). A
multi-well plate was placed on the stage incubator (37 �C, 5%
CO2, water-saturated air atmosphere) of the CellOPTIQ platform
(Clyde Biosciences Ltd, Glasgow, Scotland) and the electrical
activity, intracellular Ca2þ and contractility was measured from
areas (0.2� 0.2mm) of hiPS-CM in individual wells visualized
using a 40� (NA0.6) objective. Fluorescence signals were digitized
at 10 kHz and the records were subsequently analyzed off-line
using proprietary software (CellOPTIQ, Clyde Biosciences Ltd).
Statistical analysis. Graphing and statistical analyses were per-
formed using Prism (GraphPad Software). Data in text and fig-
ures are represented as mean 6 standard error of the mean
(SEM). The relationship between a selectivity score (S-score)
(Davis et al., 2011) and beat rate/amplitude inhibition was deter-
mined by Pearson correlation analysis. For experiments deter-
mining compound effects, significance was judged as any
change >3 * SD of the vehicle-treated group. For experiments
determining consequence of siRNA-based knockdown on beat
rate and amplitude, P-values were adjusted for multiple com-
parisons
using
the
false
discovery
rate
(FDR)
approach
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Knockdown groups with FDR-
adjusted P � .01 compared with the non-targeting siRNA group
were deemed as having an effect on CM beating.
RESULTS
Effects of KIs on hiPSC Cardiomyocyte Beating
Cellular impedance was used to evaluate the effect on hiPSC CM
beating by 65 SMKI whose affinity for 385 wild type kinases has
been published (Davis et al., 2011). Effects on CM beat rate and
amplitude were measured following a 2 h exposure based on
our previous experience that KI effects on CM beating are more
robust at 2 h than 20 min or 24 h (Lamore et al., 2013). The total
compound concentration was 3 mM to match the selectivity
profiling by Davis et al., (2011). Of the 65 compounds tested, 22
resulted in a significant change in beat rate or amplitude (Figure
1 and Supplementary Table 1). The most frequent functional
effect was a decrease in beat rate independent of amplitude
changes (17 compounds; Figure 1). One compound (GDC-0879)
increased beat rate independent of a change in amplitude
whereas two compounds (CEP-701 and PKC-412) increased beat
rate with a concomitant decreased amplitude. Two compounds
(A-674563 and GSK-690693) increased amplitude independent of
a change in beat rate. With the exception of staurosporine,
these functional effects occurred in absence of cytotoxicity as
judged by decreased cellular ATP levels and decreased cell index
measured
24 h
after
compound
addition
(Figure
1
and
Supplementary Table 1). This set of data meets criteria for fur-
ther correlation analysis by the presence of ample active and
inactive compounds with respect to functional effects on CM
beating in the absence of cytotoxicity.
Identification of Individual Kinases Critical for CM Function
We sought to identify and evaluate individual kinases contribu-
ting to functional cardiotoxicity. Inhibition of each of the 385
kinases and functional cardiotoxicity were both scored in binary
form (see Methods section) and univariate analysis was used to
determine correlation between kinase inhibition and effect on
CM beating. Of the 385 kinases, 58 correlated with functional
cardiotoxicity (MCC > 0.4, P � .001, and enrichment score > 2.0;
Table 1). Eliminating kinases not expressed in both hiPSC CM
and adult heart tissue (Babiarz et al., 2012) reduced the candi-
date list to 46 kinases (Table 1).
Experimentally testing the univariate results with additional
pharmacological probes is complicated by the lack of highly
selective
compounds.
Therefore,
as
an
independent
test,
expression of each of the 46 candidate kinases was knocked
down and effects on CM beating were evaluated. Robust knock-
down (>75% at the mRNA level) was achieved for 45 of 46 the
genes (Supplementary Table 2). For those 45 kinases, the effects
of gene knockdown on CM beat rate or amplitude were assessed
for significance in accordance with the FDR (Benjamini and
Hochberg, 1995; FDR-adjusted P < .01). 30 out of the 45 kinases
resulted in significant changes in CM beat function upon knock-
down; these effects occurred in the absence of cytotoxicity as
judged by cellular ATP and cell index (Table 2, Figure 2, and
Supplementary Table 3). Knockdown of four kinases (CAMKK2,
IKBKE, PRKCE, and STK24) decreased beat rate independent of
changes in amplitude, whereas sixteen kinases (CDK7, MAP3K2,
MAP4K2,
MST4,
NUAK1,
PAK1,
PIP4K2B,
PRKAA2,
PRKCQ,
PRKD2, PRKG1, ROCK1, RPS6KA3, STK35, TBK1, and ULK2)
decreased
beat
amplitude
without
affecting
beat
rate.
Knockdown of either PAK3 or PRKACA decreased beat ampli-
tude with a concomitant increased beat rate, whereas knock-
down of eight genes (FAK, STK4, PRKCD, MAP3K12, MAP3K4,
FER, ZAP70, and MAP4K1) simultaneously decreased beat rate
and amplitude. This functional specificity may be a valuable
first step for follow-up studies on either understanding their
biological role or providing context for toxic liability.
Kinome-Wide Promiscuity and Effects on Cardiomyocyte Beating
Given the promiscuous nature of ATP-competitive KIs at clini-
cally relevant concentrations, a simple hypothesis is that SMKI-
induced cardiotoxicity correlates with lack of selectivity across
the kinome. To quantify SMKI promiscuity, Davis et al. deter-
mined dissociation constants (Kd) and then calculated a selec-
tivity (S) score for each compound by calculating the fraction of
kinases bound at a specified concentration. This approach was
used to calculate S scores at a 3 mM test concentration for the 65
SMKI that had been screened against 385 wild-type kinases. The
resulting S scores varied widely (0.0078–0.8782), signifying a
broad range of selectivity. To examine the correlation between
kinome selectivity and functional effect on CM beating, S (3 mM)
was plotted against changes in beat rate (Figure 3a) and beat
amplitude (Figure 3b) following a 2 h exposure to 3 mM for each
inhibitor. Some highly selective compounds including GDC-
0879 [S (3 mM) ¼ 0.042] and BMS-540215 [S (3 mM) ¼ 0.086] induced
CM beating effects whereas the relatively promiscuous inhibi-
tors TG-101348 and SU14813 with S (3 mM) ¼ 0.539 and 0.542,
respectively, had no effect on CM beating. To minimize effects

 on CM beating influenced by cytotoxicity, staurosporine, the
only compound to induce cell death at 3 mM, was removed and
Pearson’s correlation coefficients (r) and their P-values were cal-
culated. Overall, S score did not significantly correlate with
changes in beat rate (r¼ �0.08, P ¼ .48) or amplitude (r ¼ �0.12,
P ¼ .34). Thus, the present measurement of promiscuity at the
kinome level is not a predictive tool of functional cardiotoxicity.
Intragroup Promiscuity and Effects on Cardiomyocyte Beating
The weak relationship between kinome-wide selectivity and
effect on CM beating warranted a more detailed analysis to
identify specific kinase groups more suitable for predictive pur-
poses. In addition to the eight groups within the typical protein
kinase superfamily (CAMK, STE, AGC, CK1, CMGC, TK, TKL, and
OTHER), we looked for correlation within the atypical protein
kinase group, which lacks sequence similarity to the typical pro-
tein kinase superfamily, as well as the lipid kinase group. To
this end, the binary classification of kinase activity and beat
activity was also used to identify any potential correlations
between activity within particular kinase group(s) and func-
tional beat effects. The CAMK, AGC, STE, and OTHER kinase
groups were identified as strongly correlated with functional
cardiotoxicity (MCC > 0.4, P � .001, and enrichment score > 2.0;
Table 3). The atypical, CMGC, and CK1 groups were identified as
having a weaker correlative relationship (MCC < 0.4, P < .05, and
enrichment scores < 2.0). The lipid, TKL, and TK groups did not
significantly correlate with functional cardiotoxicity (MCC < 0.4,
P > .05, and enrichment scores < 2.0). Thus, rather than identify-
ing concentration within a particular group, these data indicate
culprit promiscuity is spread across at least four groups.
Identification of Sentinel Kinases With Predictive Value
To identify a minimum set of individual kinases that could be
used as “predictor” or “sentinel” kinases, the data set was
probed using recursive partitioning. Using the binary classifica-
tion framework to describe kinase activity and effects on CM
beating, compounds were categorized into one of two end-
points: “decreased beat rate” (n ¼ 19) or “no change in beat rate”
(n ¼ 43). To increase statistical power, the three compounds that
increased beat rate were not included in construction of the
sentinel kinase model because the number was limited. The
classification tree was constructed by sequentially selecting
kinases that best separated out compounds that decrease beat
rate (Figure 4). The individual kinase whose pharmacological
activity best separated “decreased beat rate” from “no change in
beat rate” was RPS6KB1 (LogWorth ¼ 5.5; P ¼ 2.8 � 10�6). Of the
compounds
with
RPS6KB1
inhibitor
activity,
80%
(12/15)
decreased
beat
rate.
Removing
RPS6KB1-active
inhibitors
reduced the percentage of compounds with beat activity by half
[from 30.7% (19/62) in the full set to 15.2% (7/47) in the RPS6KB1-
inactive set]. Successively repeating this approach among these
remaining
compounds
identified
FAK
(aka
PTK2;

among the remaining RPS6KB1-inactive compounds. A third
iteration identified STK35 (LogWorth ¼ 2.6; P ¼ .003) as the best
predictor
among

compounds.
Eighteen of the nineteen compounds that were categorized as
inducing a decreased beat rate were active against at least one
of the sentinel kinases. Thus, recursive partitioning analysis of
the present data set generated a simple predictive model such
that compounds inactive at all three sentinel kinases (RPS6KB1,

 FAK, and STK35) had a 3.4% probability of affecting CM beat
activity compared with 30.7% in the full training set (Figure 4
and Table 4).
To test the model’s predictivity for the ability to translate to
a distinct compound set, we turned to our internal library of
SMKI from which we drew 102 compounds with binding data
for RPS6KB1, FAK, and STK35. Ten of these compounds were
identical to compounds in the training set but were included
because they were tested at different concentrations and there-
fore the kinase binding profiles differed. The remaining 92 com-
pounds in the test set were diverse relative to the training set,
as indicated by low Tanimoto similarity to the nearest neighbor
in the training set (ranging from 0.22 to 0.71 and computed
using ECFP4 fingerprints; Rogers and Hahn, 2010). These com-
pounds were tested in the CM impedance assay at 1 mM to
match the binding data. Five compounds that resulted in an
increased beat rate were not included in analysis as the model
was constructed to predict “decreased beat rate” versus “no
change in beat rate”. The internal AstraZeneca set revealed
fewer compounds that resulted in a decreased beat rate [13.4%
(13/97) vs 30.7% (19/62) in the training set], perhaps due to the
lower concentration tested or more highly selective drug-like
nature of the inhibitors. None of the compounds that caused a
decrease in CM beat rate affected cell viability as determined by
cellular ATP and cell index (data not shown). The 97 compounds
were scored with the recursive partitioning model. Of the 56
that were inactive at all three sentinel kinases, only two (3.6%)
had an effect on beat rate (Table 4).
We tested how well the sentinels translate to the clinic by
screening an independent set of 19 SMKI with sufficient pub-
lished clinical cardiac safety profiles and human exposure data
(Cmaxss). On the basis of label warnings, we categorized the
four without any warnings as “cardiac safe” and the fifteen
SMKI with cardiac liabilities as “cardiotoxic” [seven FDA-
approved SMKI with CV warnings and eight with CV dose limit-
ing toxicities (DLTs) in phase I or II]. We screened all 19 com-
pounds against each of the three sentinel kinases, RPS6KB1,
FAK, and STK35 at four concentrations centered around the
published human Cmax values. Kinase binding IC50 � Cmaxss
was used to delineate inhibition at clinically relevant concentra-
tions (Table 5, frequency of clinical CV toxicity listed in
Supplementary Table 5). The model correctly predicted three of

fected with either non-silencing control siRNA (siControl) or a pool of siRNA targeted against the indicated gene. Cardiomyocyte beat rate (A) or amplitude (B)
expressed as percent siControl was determined by impedance measurements 48 h post siRNA transfection. All data are expressed as mean þ SEM of three independent
experiments (� 12 wells/experiment). Asterisks indicate significant differences relative to siControl-transfected cells (*False discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted P < .01).

 the four “cardiac safe” SMKI, in that their kinase IC50 > Cmaxss
for all three kinases. Twelve of the fifteen “cardiotoxic” SMKI
were correctly predicted: their activity against sentinel kinases
was
detected
at
clinically
relevant
concentrations
(kinase
IC50 < Cmaxss) for at least one of the sentinel kinases. Out of the
three “cardiotoxic” SMKI that were missed, two (telatinib and
tivozanib) are VEGF inhibitors with hypertension as the only
cardiac-related DLT event in clinical trials. Hypertension with
VEGFR inhibitors is well established (Force et al., 2007) and medi-
ated by effects on vascular endothelial cells (Lankhorst et al.,
2015) rather than on CMs. Therefore predictivity metrics were
calculated with and without the two VEGF inhibitors (Table 6).
Contribution of Non-Kinase Targets to Cardiotoxicity Seen With Test
and Validation Sets
The sentinel kinase discovery and validation experiments
would be complicated if the sets of SMKI evaluated had direct
pharmacological effects on hERG or other non-kinase targets
that affect excitation–contraction coupling (ECC). To examine
the contributions of non-kinase targets, we selected all of the
SMKI that altered CM beating in the discovery (Ambit) and vali-
dation (AstraZeneca) sets plus a random subset that did not
alter beating. Compounds were tested for activity against six
ion channels known to control the cardiac action potential and
eight non-channel targets considered as cardiotoxicity risks.
The
data
were
interrogated
using
binary
and
regression
analysis. For binary assessment, off-target activity was classi-
fied by potency relative to concentration tested in the CM assay.
Among compounds that did not alter CM beating, 50% were
active against at least one target in the panel. For compounds
that did alter CM beating, 47% were active against at least one
target. Reviewing individual targets in the panel, there was a
lack
of
enrichment
among
beat
altering
compounds
(Supplementary Table 4a and b). Finally, regression analysis
comparing percent change in beat activity with potencies at
individual cardiotoxicity targets did not reveal significant corre-
lations for any of the targets in the panel (R2 values in
Supplementary Figure 1). The lack of correlation between beat
effects and inhibition of ion channel or non-kinase cardiotoxic-
ity targets suggest direct pharmacological inhibition of these
targets was limited in the SMKIs used in this study.
The Contribution of Selected Kinases to the ECC Mechanism
In order to achieve the broadest coverage of kinases linked to
CM function, an assay sensitive to a downstream endpoint, con-
traction measured by impedance, was selected as the discovery
screen. However, this assay does not provide mechanistic
insight as to where within the ECC process particular kinases
may be acting. In an effort to gain additional granularity on
mechanistic site(s) of action, individual kinases were knocked
down and effects on action potential duration (APD), Ca2þ tran-
sients and contractility were assessed simultaneously using an

 optical approach. For spontaneously beating hiPSC CM, a
change in beat rate can affect the beat amplitude. Therefore, in
order to specifically assess the effect on contractility, the CMs
were paced to maintain a constant beat rate (1 Hz). The kinases
chosen for investigation include the three sentinels (RPS6KB1,
FAK, STK35), a paralog of the best sentinel (RPS6KA3), and two
each that altered spontaneous beat rate (PRKCD, IKBKE) and
amplitude (PRKAA2, MAP4K2).
Comparing
across
the
kinase
knockdown
experiments
revealed a remarkable diversity and specificity for each compo-
nent of the ECC process. Reduced expression of RPS6KB1 and
MAP4K2 resulted in a shortened APD, which in turn shortened
the
duration
of
the
Ca2þ
and
contractility
transients.
Knockdown of STK35 had no effect on APD, but shortened both
the
Ca2þ
and
contractility
transients
(Figure
5,
and
Supplementary Figure 2). Loss of RPS6KA3 and IKBKE increased
the amplitude of the Ca2þ transient, with the former also
decreasing
the
duration
of
the
contractility
transient.
Knockdown of PRKCD had no effect on APD or the Ca2þ transi-
ent, but did reduce the duration of contraction. Knockdown of
FAK and PRKAA2 had no noteworthy effects detectable by opti-
cal methods.
Kinase knockdowns were assessed for modulation of the
coupling between APD and Ca2þ as well as between Ca2þ and
contraction
by
analyzing
hysteresis
loops
(Supplementary
Figure 3). Compared with assessment of each of these parame-
ters in isolation, hysteresis loops allow the interdependency of
each parameter to be highlighted and provide fingerprints of
different mechanisms of action. RPS6KB1 hysteresis data indi-
cated the effects on action potential were associated with mini-
mal changes in coupling between ECC nodes. In contrast,
MAP4K2 knockdown hysteresis loops revealed decreased cou-
pling from APD to Ca2þ followed by increased coupling from
Ca2þ to contraction. Knockdown of both RPS6KA3 and IKBKE
revealed increased APD to Ca2þ coupling with comparably
decreased
coupling
of
Ca2þ
changes
to
contraction
(Supplementary Figure 3). See Supplementary Material for fur-
ther analysis and discussion of these data.
DISCUSSION
The central aim of the present study was to discover individual
kinases whose inhibition alters human CM beating. We identi-
fied 30 kinases that met criteria of having (1) pharmacological
inhibition highly correlated with beat changes, (2) expression in
both hiPSC CM and adult heart tissue and (3) single gene knock-
down affecting CM beating. From the perspective of cardiovas-
cular
biology,
this
work
identifies
novel
kinase
signaling
pathways regulating CM beating. From a drug discovery point-
of-view, the impact may be more immediate. The identification
of kinases linked to CM beating expands the ability to predict
and assess mechanisms of drug-induced cardiotoxicity.
Many of the 30 kinases identified have a limited known role
in cardiac function. No published findings exist directly linking
MST4, STK24 (aka MST3), MAP4K1, or MAP3K12 to CM function.
In contrast, calcium handling and contractility signaling path-
ways were well represented. In addition to CAMK and PKC iso-
forms, both PAK1 and PAK3 regulate CM contractility by
enhancing sensitivity to calcium (reviewed in (Sheehan et al.,
2007)). STK4 (aka MST1) phosphorylates cardiac troponin I
in vitro (You et al., 2009). Similarly, PRKACA, the catalytic subunit
of Protein Kinase A (PKA), acts downstream of the b-adrenergic
receptors (Kamp and Hell, 2000; Layland et al., 2005). PIP4K2B
catalyzes formation of phosphatidylinositol-5,4-bisphosphate
(PIP2), known to directly regulate several potassium channels
(Kruse et al., 2012; Stansfeld et al., 2009).
An additional 15 kinases met the criteria of having pharma-
cological inhibition that was highly correlated with effects on
beat activity but were not confirmed by single gene knockdown.

not judged to be significant for beat rate (r2 ¼ 0.008 and P ¼ .48) or beat amplitude
(r2 ¼ 0.014 and P ¼ .34).

 The criteria of knocking down mRNA by 75% (Supplementary
Table 2) may be insufficient to deplete functional reserve in
some kinase pathways. These kinases merit additional follow
up. More complete kinase inhibition of individual kinase is a
straightforward starting point. Alternatively, some of these 15
kinases may regulate CM beating in combination with another
kinase such as a closely related homolog or as part of conver-
gent signaling pathways. Any necessity for dual inhibition of

 pairs of kinases in the primary pharmacological screen would
not be distinguished by the univariate analysis and would fail
single gene knockdown confirmation. Thus, follow-up studies
could explore combination effects by dual knock down of pairs
or by repeating the analysis using larger panels of SMKIs suffi-
ciently powered for multivariate analysis.
One measure to evaluate the success or limitations of the
present search for kinases is to consider the kinases missed rel-
ative to literature precedent. In a review of KI cardiotoxicity,
Force and Kolaja highlight four kinase pathways linked to func-
tional effects: PKC, CAMK, PKA, and PI3Kc (Force and Kolaja,
2011). Our analysis identified members of three of these four
families; kinases identified included the PKA catalytic subunit
(PRKACA and the closely related PRKX), one CAMK isoform
(CAMK1D and a kinase in the pathway CAMKK2), and three PKC
isoforms (PRKCD, PRKCE, PRKCQ along with the related PKN2).
Interestingly, PI3Kc was not identified. Inspection of the pub-
lished
PI3Kc
data
reveals
that
gene
deletion
selectively
increased the beat rate of sinoatrial nodal CM but not atrial CM
(Rose et al., 2007). Because we used CM with a very low propor-
tion of nodal cells, it is perhaps expected that we would miss

 PI3Kc activity. When the capability emerges to direct cellular
maturation and differentiation of hiPSC into adult atrial, ven-
tricular, or sinus nodal CM, future studies could retest kinase
profiles in these different CM types.
A second aim was to evaluate the kinome for predictive
pharmacology tools. It is intuitive to hypothesize that com-
pounds inhibiting more kinases will have a greater chance of
inhibiting kinases that control CM beating, thereby raising the
possibility that kinome promiscuity may be a metric that pre-
dicts cardiotoxicity (Chen et al., 2008; Lal et al., 2013). Another
widely recognized observation is that the overwhelming major-
ity of SMKI with clinical cardiotoxicity are tyrosine kinases
inhibitors, thereby raising the possibility that promiscuity
within the tyrosine kinase group may be predictive (Kruse et al.,
2012; Sharma et al., 2017). The present analysis revealed a weak
correlation between kinase selectivity and effect on beat rate or
amplitude (Figure 3) and no particular concentration of promis-
cuity within the tyrosine kinase group (MCC ¼ 0.04, P ¼ .53).
Promiscuity within four of the ten kinase groups (CAMK, Other,
STE, and AGC; MCC > 0.4, P < .05, and enrichment > 2.0) were
correlated with effects on CM beating (Table 3). However, these
four groups comprise � 51% of the human kinome. Activity
against hERG, or other cardiotoxicity-related targets did not cor-

 promiscuity within a particular group, or known cardiotoxicity
targets proved to be a practical tool for predicting SMKI func-
tional cardiotoxicity.
Rather than kinome or tyrosine kinase promiscuity, the pre-
dictive tools identified were three sentinel kinases, RPS6KB1,
FAK, and STK35 (Table 6). The predictivity was validated by ret-
rospective analysis of clinical SMKI. While this retrospective
test is necessary, its interpretation comes with the caveats of
comparing biochemical potencies with clinical concentrations.
For kinases, these include differences not limited to: (1) ATP
concentration, (2) protein constructs, (3) kinase binding part-
ners, and (4) cell penetrance/pharmacokinetic profiles. Thus,
rather than lending too much credence to the precise values of
predictivity metrics, we submit that the presently available data
indicate sentinel predictivity is highly likely to translate to the
clinic. It is also important to emphasize that SMKI-associated
functional cardiotoxicity was assessed in CMs which does not
address vascular, neuronal, hormonal or structural cardiotoxic-
ity/cytotoxicity. Future studies aiming to refine the choice of
sentinel kinases may include compounds that selectively affect
amplitude, rhythmicity or increased beat rate and thereby
advance the current predictive model or focus it on functional
endpoints such as contractility, arrhythmia, and tachycardia.
Most of the 30 kinases identified in this study were previ-
ously unknown or underappreciated as regulators of CM beat-
ing, hence resolving the signaling networks through which they
modulate ECC will require extensive follow-up. At the molecular
level, the scope of this challenge can be gauged from phospho-
proteome analysis which suggests 20 phosphorylation sites per
kinase (Huang et al., 2014). From a cellular perspective, it will be
valuable to elucidate the modulation point(s) within the ECC
cascade affected by each kinase. A suite of technologies have
emerged to enable measuring the influence of KI and kinase
siRNA on APD, calcium flux, and contraction either individually
or simultaneously (eg, MEA, FLIPR, impedance, and CellOPTIQ;
Hortigon-Vinagre et al., 2016; Peters et al., 2015). Application to
the present kinases illustrates both the diversity and complex-
ity
of
their
ECC
modulation.
For
example,
RPS6KB1
and
RPS6KA3 are close paralogs yet were found to differentially reg-
ulate APD and calcium flux, respectively (Figure 5). Both are
novel findings—neither RPS6KB1’s involvement in action poten-
tial regulation nor RPS6KA3’s regulation of calcium flux were
previously recognized. The two kinases that affected beat
amplitude did so via different mechanisms as judged by their
profiles in APD and calcium transient studies; the same is true
for the two kinases that reduced beat rate. Thus, cellular func-
tion assays may provide the guidance necessary to focus future
molecular studies aimed at identifying phosphorylation sub-
strates and delineate signaling networks regulated by particular
kinases.
The present study reveals (1) a novel platform to deconvo-
lute SMKI cardiotoxicity by combining kinome-wide human kin-
ase profiles and human stem cell-derived CMs with label-free
CM beat detection, (2) a simple predictive model of three senti-
nel kinases, and (3) a list of kinases mechanistically linked to
effects on CM beating. We envision future safety-testing cas-
cades for SMKI drug discovery will use the sentinels as a high
throughput screen for early assessment at low cost. Any com-
pounds flagged would be tested directly for CM beating activity
in vitro. If activity is confirmed, follow-up mechanistic studies
would be enabled by the list of 30 candidate kinases. Once the
culprit kinases are identified, testing with traditional kinase
assays could be used to screen for activity, develop SAR, and
design-out CV toxicity risk. Taken together, the present findings
offer the opportunity for a paradigm shift from the present era
where the majority of SMKI drugs exhibit cardiotoxicity in the
clinic, to rational design of SMKI CV safety.
