Food and beverage consumption has a great impact on the environment, although there is a lack of 
information concerning the whole diet. The environmental impact of 153 Italian adults (51 omnivores, 
51 ovo-lacto-vegetarians, 51 vegans) and the inter-individual variability within dietary groups were 
assessed in a real-life context. Food intake was monitored with a 7-d dietary record to calculate 
nutritional values and environmental impacts (carbon, water, and ecological footprints). The Italian 
Mediterranean Index was used to evaluate the nutritional quality of each diet. The omnivorous choice 
generated worse carbon, water and ecological footprints than other diets. No differences were found 
for the environmental impacts of ovo-lacto-vegetarians and vegans, which also had diets more 
adherent to the Mediterranean pattern. A high inter-individual variability was observed through 
principal component analysis, showing that some vegetarians and vegans have higher environmental 
impacts than those of some omnivores. Thus, regardless of the environmental benefits of plant-based 
diets, there is a need for thinking in terms of individual dietary habits. To our knowledge, this is the first 
time environmental impacts of three dietary regimens are evaluated using individual recorded dietary 
intakes rather than hypothetical diet or diets averaged over a population.
It is well known that food choices are strong determinants of human health, but recently awareness has grown 
about the fact that the foods and beverages we produce, choose and consume may significantly affect the envi-
ronment1–3. Since plant-based diets often emerge as nutritionally and environmentally advantageous4, a potential 
strategy to reduce both the rate of many human non-communicable diseases and prevent environmental deterio-
ration might lie in promoting the consumption of plant-based instead of animal foods4–8.
The Mediterranean Diet (MD), which could be considered a plant-oriented dietary approach, appears able to 
face both health and environmental concerns. A MD regimen has been associated with reduced incidence of obe-
sity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and has been shown to represent a valid preventative strategy towards 
certain cancers9–13. At the same time, MD has been described as a wise choice to reduce the environmental impact 
associated with food consumption3, 6, 14.
Despite the general agreement on the environmental impact of food1, there is a lack of information about the 
real influence of the whole diet not based on hypothetical intake on different indexes of environmental impact. 
Although greenhouse gas emissions have been extensively studied, the assessment of other indicators, such as 
water consumption and land use demand, have not been examined in relation to specific populations and actual 
dietary choices15. To improve evidence-based nutritional and environmental joint recommendations, more thor-
ough research should be carried out to properly demonstrate the exact capability of dietary regimens on overall 
environmental impact5.
The extent to which real diet affect the environment has usually been analysed by applying Life Cycle 
Assessment (LCA) method to single foodstuffs or food groups16, failing to reflect actual eating habits. Just like

what happened in the framework of nutritional epidemiology, that has now leaped from a short-sighted focus 
on single dietary components to a more integrative approach focused on whole diets, the whole concept of envi-
ronmental impact evaluation urgently needs to evolve toward a comprehensive approach17. LCA analysis is 
based mainly on dietary recommendations, hypothetical diets or average consumption of population groups18. 
However, previous studies have shown that compared with recommendations or model diets, food consumption 
based on recorded diets is usually associated with higher environmental impacts19. Therefore, using actual food 
intake data appears to be the best strategy to perform realistic, not theoretical, environmental evaluations18. In 
addition, using recorded dietary intake allows the exploration of more detailed associations between environ-
mental impact factors and food groups, nutrients, and/or calories actually consumed by a person or a group of 
people19, 20.
Interdisciplinary research is needed to integrate both health and environmental variables in relation to human 
nutrition and, in this framework, the use and analysis of real, diets within a real-life setting should be encouraged 
and appears to be a crucial step for the evolution of nutrition ecology and for achieving behavioural changes4, 17, 
21. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been so far conducted by considering, simultaneously, the three 
major environmental indicators of the agro-food system in the framework of different dietary regimens based 
on real food intakes. Previous studies only provided data for different food or food groups, meals, and dietary 
models, generally linked to a national population18, without taking into account real diets, or the variance exist-
ing within a whole population19. For these reasons, this study aimed (i) to explore the environmental impact of 
omnivorous, ovo-lacto-vegetarian, and vegan diets in a real-life context of an Italian population; (ii) to examine 
the inter-individual variability within each dietary group.
Methods
Subjects. 
Volunteers were recruited for a previous observational multi-centre study and were enrolled 
across four centres in Italy (Bari, Bologna, Parma, and Turin). A total of 153 apparently healthy adults (aged 
18–60 years), recruited according to their self-reported habitual diets, completed the study: 51 omnivores (O), 
51 ovo-lacto-vegetarians (VG), and 51 vegans (V). Inclusion and exclusion criteria, recruitment procedure, and 
characteristics of the subjects have been fully described by De Filippis and colleagues22.
The study protocol (registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02118857 on April 18th, 2014) was approved by the 
Ethics Committees of Bari, Bologna, Parma, and Turin and carried out according to the International Conference 
on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All the volunteers signed an informed consent at recruit-
ment. Enrolled participants were instructed to fill in a 7-d weighed food record to obtain accurate information on 
food and beverages consumed the week after the visit with researchers.
Dietary information. 
Participants were asked to record all food and beverages consumed over 7 consecu-
tive days using a weighed food record, as previously described22, 23, and to send the completed food record to the 
Department of Food Science of the University of Parma. Food and drink items consumed were divided into food 
categories, principally to control the accuracy of the enrolment of participants in one of the three diet groups, 
based on self-reported eating habits. The food database of the European Institute of Oncology24 was used to 
calculate daily energy and nutrient intakes. The Italian MD Index25 was used to evaluate the level of adherence 
to the Mediterranean dietary pattern, a measure of the participants’ diet healthiness. This tool is a 11-unit die-
tary score specific for the Italian population and it attributes positive points to Mediterranean foods (e.g. pasta, 
Mediterranean vegetables, fruit, legumes, olive oil, and fish) and negative points to non-Mediterranean foods (e.g. 
soft drinks, butter, red meat, potatoes and alcohol). Ethanol received 1 point for intake up to 12 g/day; abstainers 
and persons who consumed more than 12 g/day received a 0.
Environmental impacts. 
Environmental impact analysis was carried out to analyse the degree to which 
differences in dietary choices affect the environment by using data calculated according to the LCA methodology, 
which takes into consideration all phases of food chain26. In particular, the environmental impact database of the 
Barilla Centre for Food and Nutrition27, 28 was used to evaluate environmental impact of the three dietary groups, 
taking into account three indexes considered to be the most representative of the agro-food system29: the carbon 
footprint (CF), the water footprint (WF), and the ecological footprint (EF). These three indexes account for the 
greenhouse gas emissions, the consumption of water resources, and the amount of biologically productive land/
sea needed to produce a unit of food product, respectively. The CF (expressed as g CO2 eq./kg), WF (L/kg), and 
EF (global m2/kg) of foodstuffs were weighed according to the actual consumption, as previously described30, and 
the mean daily CF (g CO2 eq./day), WF (L/day), and EF (global m2/day) were calculated for each participants.
Statistics. 
Descriptive statistics and statistical analysis have been carried out using SPSS® statistics 21.0 soft-
ware (IBM, Chicago, IL), and performed at P < 0.05 of significance level. Daily energy and nutrient intakes, CF, 
WF, and EF are presented as mean and standard deviation, as the distribution of these variables was normal.
A one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey HSD test was employed to assess energy and nutrient intake differ-
ences among the three diet groups, and to evaluate the effects of each dietary approach, also by food groups, on 
CF, WF, and EF. Food group intakes and Italian MD score are presented as medians and interquartile range, as 
the distribution of these variables was invariably skewed from normality. To assess the differences in food group 
intakes and in the Italian MD score among the three dietary approaches, non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was 
performed, and, when significant, the pairwise multiple comparison was applied to define specific differences.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to achieve a better understanding of the characteristics of 
each diet group and to explore the inter-individual variability. In order to simplify the model, PCA was carried 
out considering energy and nutrient intakes, adherence to the MD pattern, and environmental impact indicators, 
without keeping into account food groups. PCA was carried out with varimax rotation to explore the relationship

between environmental impacts and dietary factors in each dietary group. The same configuration was used to 
perform a second PCA, considering nutrient intakes, adherence to the MD, and environmental impact indicators 
adjusted by the energy intake. One-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD test was employed to evaluate differences in the 
scores of each principal component (PC) among dietary groups, for both PCAs.
Results
One hundred and fifty-three 7-d food records were collected. Participants belonging to the different diet groups 
were similar in terms of BMI, age, and gender (Table 1). Daily intakes of food and beverages, grouped in the same 
categories for the environmental impact analysis, and Italian MD score, as measured in the three diet groups, 
are reported in Table 2. As expected, VG and V were the highest consumers of vegetables and fruits (678.7 and 
871.4 g/d, respectively), whereas O were the lowest (386.1 g/d). On the other hand, foods of animal origin (meat, 
fish, milk and dairy products, eggs, and animal fat) were significantly higher for O (357.3 g/d compared with 
83.2 g/d for VG and as expected 0.0 g/d for V). The three dietary groups showed a medium to high level of adher-
ence to the MD25, and MD score was significantly higher in the V group (7.0) and lower for the O group (4.0).
With respect to energy and macronutrient intake (Table 3), although energy intake was similar among the 
three diet groups, protein and carbohydrate intakes in O subjects were the highest and the lowest, respectively, 
while V and VG groups showed similar intakes. The highest fat intake was seen in the omnivores, while the lowest 
characterised vegans.
The analysis of the environmental impacts of the three diet groups revealed how the animal-based diet is con-
siderably associated with a higher impact for each environmental indicator evaluated. Indeed, the O choice gen-
erated significantly worse CF, WF, and EF (P < 0.001) when compared to the other diets (Fig. 1). No differences 
were found regarding the environmental impact when comparing VG and V groups.

The contribution of each food group on all the three environmental indicators by diet groups is presented in 
Table 4. Although food of animal origin was not the category consumed in greatest quantity, it was the largest 
contribution to footprint values for the O group. Meat, fish, and other animal-based foods (i.e. eggs, milk and 
dairy products, and animal fat) made the largest contribution to the environmental footprints of the O group, 
while animal-based foodstuffs had an intermediate impact for the VG one. As expected, foods of animal origin 
were not represented in the V group. The contribution of the meat and fish category to the omnivorous diet was: 
37% for the CF, 38% for the WF, and 44% for the EF. Other animal-based foodstuffs contributed by 22% and 26% 
to the CF, and by 26% and 31% to the EF of the O and VG groups, respectively, whereas they represented the 17% 
of the WF for both the O and VG groups. Conversely, the greatest part of the environmental impact of V and VG 
was attributable to the consumption of vegetable foods. The sum of the food categories “cereals and their deriva-
tives” and “other vegetable-based foods” (e.g. vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts and dried fruit, potatoes and other 
tubers, vegetable fat, and vegetable alternatives) accounted for 24%, 56%, and 84% of the CF, 31%, 69%, and 92% 
of the WF, and 21%, 58%, and 90% of the EF for the O, VG, and V groups, respectively. The smallest part of each 
environmental indicator was linked to sweets and desserts, and drinks.
When inter-individual variability was explored by applying PCA, two PCs explained 72% of the total variation 
(Fig. 2a). Almost 52% of the observed variability was explained by the first PC (PC1) that correlated positively 
with the environmental impact indexes EF, CF, and WF, total protein intake, total fat intake, and energy intake, 
while negatively with the Italian MD score. Principal component 2 (PC2) had high component loadings from the 
total carbohydrate intake, energy intake, and MD score.
Individual scores of each PC were computed, clearly highlighting the differences existing among dietary 
choices (P < 0.001 for both PCs), as well as within each diet group (% of variability at Supplemental Table S3) 
(Fig. 2b). The O group, with high scores for PC1 and low scores for PC2, was defined as a dietary choice with 
higher CF, WF, and EF values, higher consumption of proteins and fats while lower consumption of carbohydrates,

and lower adherence to the Italian MD. On the contrary, VG and V groups, which resulted to be quite similar, 
showed negative PC1 scores and positive PC2 scores. This implies that VG and V groups are characterized by 
a lower environmental impact, a lower consumption of proteins and fats, a higher consumption of carbohy-
drates, and a higher adherence to the Italian MD. Inter-individual variability within every diet groups was mainly 
affected by the energy intake and the level of intake of carbohydrates (variability within PC2 was higher than var-
iability within PC1, Supplemental Table S3). Variability among subjects within the O group was higher than that 
recorded for the VG and V groups (see dispersion at Fig. 2b and standard deviations for each PC at Supplemental 
Table S3). Moreover, it must be taken into account that some specific subjects within a particular group may have 
environmental impacts notably different from the other subjects belonging to the same group. Therefore, to over-
come the effect that the energy density of a diet may have on the magnitude of the environmental impact of each 
subject, a second PCA was performed after normalizing each variable by energy intake of each subject. Results 
of this new PCA confirmed the same trend for each dietary group, as well as the high inter-individual variability 
within every group (Supplemental Fig. S1 and Supplemental Table S4). Besides noting the higher environmental 
impact of some VG and V when individually compared to some O (Supplemental Fig. S1b), the presence of two 
vegan participants having extremely high environmental impact values was particularly interesting. When delv-
ing into their nutritional data, these two subjects were characterized by the sole consumption of fruits.
Discussion
In order to explore the environmental impact of different dietary regimens, three dietary groups were selected: 
omnivorous, ovo-lacto-vegetarian, and vegan. The analysis of food patterns highlighted the definition of 
well-matched diet groups based on participants’ self-reported eating habits.
Conversely to previous data of environment impact obtained on hypothetical diets and meals, the present 
results are based on recorded intakes and have the clear advantage of being realistic. The three dietary regi-
mens were equivalent to one another for energy content, but differed from the custom diets designed in previ-
ous studies7, 28. As an example, the environmental impacts of different dietary patterns (omnivorous, vegetarian, 
and vegan) were assessed in Italy by designing a weekly well-balanced plan, with a daily average energy intake 
ranging between 2100 and 2300 kcal7. In another study dealing with the environmental impact of omnivorous, 
vegetarian and vegan diets, three weekly menus were designed, and the average energy intake resulted to be a

little higher than 2000 kcal/d28. Recorded energy intakes were indeed higher than those hypothesised before, 
especially for O, and showed a remarkable variance within our study groups, but all fell within the reference 
values for Italian healthy adults31, 32 with a normal BMI. It should be noted that the mean energy intake of our 
population was similar to a designed dietary plan of 2400 kcal in which the environmental impact of omnivorous, 
ovo-lacto-vegetarian and vegan diets were compared33. Despite these similarities on energy intake, modelling 
approaches referring to an average diet may produce unrealistic food combination and quantities, since eat-
ing patterns vastly differ among individuals34. Indeed, our three diet groups differed in their nutrient profiles. 
Specifically, carbohydrate intake was always matching the 45–60% of daily calories recommended for the Italian 
population31, 32, with the O and V groups close to the lower and the upper values, respectively. Total fat intake fell 
within the reference range of 20–35% of daily calories31, 35 only in the V group, while O and VG volunteers had 
fat intakes slightly over the recommended values. Protein intake was within the recommended 10–20% of daily 
calories36 for all the diet groups. When compared to dietary models, which are standardised to match the energy 
contribution for protein, lipid and carbohydrate with recommended values7, 28, our assessment revealed: 1) lower 
intakes of carbohydrates in the O and VG groups, 2) lower intakes of proteins in the VG and V groups, and 3) 
higher intakes of lipids in all the diet groups, especially for O and VG.
These differences between real and hypothetical diets underline the need to observe and analyse recorded die-
tary intakes in order to properly assess the environmental impact of dietary approaches. Only a few studies have 
assessed the environmental impact of actual dietary intake calculated on the basis of CF, WF, and EF simultane-
ously. Both Donati et al.30 and Germani et al.29 evaluated the carbon, water, and land footprints of the actual food 
intake of the Italian adult population, but without taking into account any differences in the dietary regimen. Data 
on the environmental impact of the Italian household consumption are consistent with our results for all the three 
environmental indicators29. Germani et al. also compared the actual Italian food consumption to a MD model, 
highlighting the lower value of the three indices in MD compared to the actual Italian diet29. Similar results were 
found in other studies, in which a shift of the Italian average food consumption towards a MD pattern resulted in 
a reduction of the food environmental impact on natural resources, especially on greenhouse gas emissions37 and 
water usage38. Indeed, in accordance with numerous studies, the MD emerges as a dietary regimen with beneficial 
environmental and health effects14, 29, 39, 40. Along with the nutritional profiles, the notable adherence to the MD 
revealed a general healthy eating pattern of our participants in all the three dietary regimens. These results are 
consistent with those previously reported by Benedetti et al.41 in which Italians appeared to have a moderately 
high level of adherence to the MD.
In addition to the MD, other predominantly plant-based diets appear environmentally better than meat-based 
ones21, 42, 43. Our results are consistent with those reports, since, in the present study, VG and V diets represent 
a clear environmental advantage with respect to the O one for all the three environmental evaluated indicators. 
This aspect, which is related to the biggest environmental impact generated by a greater consumption of animal 
products, had already been hypothesized7, 28.
However, the big differences highlighted when observing virtual scenarios are not so evident when taking into 
account real-life contexts. In particular, the V approach was not associated with significantly lower environmental 
footprints when compared to VG one. A likely explanation might be that, while unprocessed plant-based food-
stuffs usually replace animal-based products in hypothetical vegetarian and vegan diets18, the real plant-based

diets are instead characterised by industrially highly-processed plant-based meat and dairy substitutes (e.g. 
seitan burger and soy yoghurt). Some people opt for highly processed, high-fat products instead of nutritious 
plant-based foodstuffs44. Moreover, the lower energy density of plant-based foodstuffs results in a higher food 
intake for V with respect to VG (around 12.5% in terms of food weight), possibly explaining the lack of environ-
mental benefits of a vegan diet in comparison with an ovo-lacto-vegetarian choice.
Comparison of the environmental impact of different populations remains very difficult, as data found in 
the literature vary widely among studies. Differences in geographical areas, data sources, and dietary assess-
ment strategies could represent explanatory factors for this variability45. In the present study, as an example, CF 
equalled 3.96 ± 0.98, 2.60 ± 0.62, and 2.34 ± 0.50 kg CO2-eq per person/d for the O, VG, and V group, respec-
tively, as assessed with a 7-d food record. Without considering the specific diet of the participants, the same 
parameter was 3.44 kg CO2-eq per person/d in the Italian INRAN-SCAI cohort (2313 subjects, aged 18–65 years) 
using a self-recorded 3-d dietary record29. Differences among European populations were detected in various 
studies resulting in: 3.24 kg CO2-eq per person/d for the UK-NDNS cohort (1491 subjects, aged 19–94 years), 
assessed through a 4-d food record46; 3.55 and 4.69 kg CO2-eq per person/d for women and men, respectively, 
of the INCA2 French cohort (2624 adults) recording a 7-d food record47; 3.87 kg CO2-eq per person/d for the 
Nederland EPIC cohort (40011 adults), measured through a food frequency questionnaire48; and 3.76 and 5.04 kg 
CO2-eq per person/d, if evaluated with a food frequency questionnaire or with a 7-d weighed dietary record, 
respectively, in 166 Sweden volunteers49.
Beyond the impact of dietary choices, variations in the average environmental impact of a particular diet or a 
population have been attributed to differences on individual choices50, gender51 or household structure52. In the 
present study, the high inter-individual variability registered within each dietary group is worth attention. In par-
ticular, it is interesting to note the presence of some VG and V subjects with individual values of environmental 
impact higher than some of the O study group. The high impact of these specific subjects was mainly attributed to 
a high consumption of proteins and fats, but energy intake also contributed. High meat consumption and high-fat 
vegetarian diets were hypothesized to require more land resources than other food choices53. Inter-individual 
variability was also conditioned by energy intake of each subject, which is associated with adequate nutritional 
needs and influenced by energy density of the diet. When impact data were adjusted by energy intake, as also 
reported by Soret et al.44, the analysis brought to light an extremely high environmental impact of some subjects, 
in particular fruitarians.
A focus on a specific population, even though participants belong to four geographically distant areas in Italy, 
and the fact that seasonality, farming and cattle rearing typology, and food production methods were not taken 
into account for the environmental impact evaluation should be considered the main weaknesses of this study. In 
addition, the environmental database used presents some intrinsic limitations. Although it is regularly updated 
and based entirely on public data and information from scientific literature, it cannot be considered complete. 
As a consequence, data related to food subgroups and not to the single food item were used. Correspondence 
among specific foodstuffs and the subgroup to which these foods were assigned, as well as the environmental 
impact values for each food subgroup, are provided at Supplemental Tables S1 and S2, respectively. The WF of fish 
and seafood were not available and the environmental data on coffee and tea were not easily attributable because 
linked to dry powder and not to ready-to-use products. Nevertheless, this is the first study to evaluate simultane-
ously the carbon, water, and land impact of real recorded and weighed food intakes in groups, although not large, 
of O, VG, and V.
To reach an environmentally sustainable solution, animal-based foodstuffs should be partially replaced with 
fruits, vegetables, legumes, and cereals, according to nutritional guidelines. At the same time, observations 
regarding inter-individual variability are of critical importance as the generic definition of every dietary pattern 
may dramatically conceal the impact of individual choices on environmental footprints. This emphasizes the need 
for thinking not only in terms of dietary group but also of individual dietary habits, irrespective of dietary choice. 
These aspects should be considered before launching equivocal messages to the general population through the 
media, and/or underpinning certain dietary choices.
Dietary recommendations in terms of environmental impacts deserve further studies, considering, for 
instance, the choice of locally grown and seasonal products as well as agricultural and processing techniques. 
Health status should be also included in this multifactorial scenario dealing with food choice, energy intake, and 
environmental impact. This holistic approach, merging health preservation and disease prevention with environ-
mental sustainability in the dietary habits framework should be pursued. Educating people to make little changes 
in their dietary behaviours could be a key action towards this common goal.
