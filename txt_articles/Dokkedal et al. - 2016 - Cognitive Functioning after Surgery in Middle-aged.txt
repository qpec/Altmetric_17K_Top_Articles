 the association between exposure to surgery and level of cognitive functioning in a sample of 
8,503 middle-aged and elderly twins.
Methods—Results from five cognitive tests were compared in twins exposed to surgery, 
classified as either major, minor, hip and knee replacement, or other, with those of a reference 
group without surgery using linear regression adjusted for sex and age. Genetic and shared 
environmental confounding was addressed in intra-pair analyses of 87 monozygotic and 124 
dizygotic same-sexed twin pairs in whom one had a history of major surgery and the other did not.
Results—Statistically significantly lower composite cognitive score was found in twins with at 
least one major surgery compared with the reference group (mean difference −0.27 [95% CI:
−0.48;−0.06]), corresponding to one tenth of a standard deviation, i.e., a negligible effect size. In 
the intra-pair analysis the surgery-exposed co-twin had the lower cognitive score in 49% [95% CI: 
42%;56%] of the pairs. None of the other groups differed from the reference group except the 
knee and hip replacement group that tended to have higher cognitive scores (mean difference 0.35 
[95% CI:−0.18; 0.87]).
Conclusions—A history of major surgery was associated with a negligibly lower level of 
cognitive functioning. The supplementary analyses suggest that preoperative cognitive functioning 
and underlying diseases were more important for cognitive functioning in mid and late life than 
surgery and anesthesia.
Introduction
Cognitive impairment is a well-known complication after surgery with delirium and 
postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) as the most common disorders.1 Early (7-day) 
POCD occurs in adult surgical patients of all ages, but elderly patients are at higher risk, and 
at three months after surgery, cognitive impairment is still detectable in patients above 60 
years.2–5 POCD may be present for longer than six months in some patients6 with potential 
long-term implications for the patient including impaired quality of life,7,8 increased 
mortality risk,3,9 higher prevalence of time receiving welfare benefits, and increased risk of 
leaving the labor market prematurely.9
In recent years, POCD has received increasing attention in the literature, and several 
pathophysiological factors and pathways have been suggested, including anesthetics and 
inflammatory response to the surgical trauma.10 Animal studies suggest that general 
anesthetics are a possible pathogenic factor of POCD as brain cell damages, apoptosis and 
decrease in cognitive skills are seen in animals after prolonged exposure.11–15 Based on 
evidence from human studies, type of surgery is suggested as a risk factor of POCD as the 
incidence of early POCD after minor surgery was significantly lower than after major 
surgery.16 Several explanations for this finding have been proposed including non-resolution 
of the inflammatory response following surgery.10,17 Moreover, the disease prompting the 
surgery may be responsible for the cognitive impairment as two very common diseases 
among the elderly, namely cardiac disease and cancer, are found to be associated with 
cognitive impairment.18–20 A longitudinal study has shown that patients with coronary 
artery disease showed significant declines in different cognitive domains after six years of 
follow-up, regardless of whether they had on-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)

 surgery, off-pump CABG surgery or no surgery.19 Furthermore, the incidence of cognitive 
impairment in colorectal cancer patients prior to chemotherapy is more than three times that 
of aged-matched healthy controls.20 No differences were found by disease stage or between 
patients pre- and postoperatively, indicating that factors other than surgery and anesthesia 
were responsible for the higher proportion of cognitive impairment in these patients at 
baseline. Mild cognitive impairment with memory deficits has been shown to associate with 
subsequent dementia, particularly Alzheimer’s disease (AD)21, and it has further been 
suggested that POCD and dementia share some of the perioperative risk factors, including 
anesthetics.22 However, a meta-analysis23 including 15 case control studies found that a 
history of exposure to general anesthesia was not associated with an increased risk of AD, 
and also in a recent cohort study it was not possible to ascertain an association between 
POCD and dementia.24
Our aim was to examine the association between exposure to surgery and subsequent level 
of cognitive functioning in a very large population of middle-aged and elderly twins with 
almost complete records of surgeries since 1977, hereby enabling us to test for more subtle 
differences in cognitive functioning. The use of a twin design further enabled us to address 
potential confounding from shared environmental and genetic factors as an approach to 
adjust for preoperative cognitive functioning.
Materials and Methods
The present study was based on the linkage of the intake examination data of the 
Longitudinal Study of Middle-Aged Danish Twins (MADT) and the Longitudinal Study of 
Aging Danish Twins (LSADT) with the Danish National Patient Register (NPR) in 
Copenhagen. Both studies included an assessment of cognitive functioning and have 
previously been described in detail elsewhere.25–27 In brief, participants in the MADT and 
the LSADT were ascertained through the Danish Twin Registry (DTR) comprising twin 
pairs born in 1870–2004 and considered representative of the general population in 
Denmark.28,29 The MADT represented a random sample of 120 intact twin pairs from each 
birth cohort from 1931 to 1952. The LSADT was initiated in 1995 and included Danish 
twins aged 75 years or older and residing in Denmark by January 1995. Further cohorts aged 
at least 70 years were added in 1997, 1999 and 2001. The MADT and the LSADT included 
a questionnaire on socio-demographic factors, health and diseases, life style factors along 
with physical and cognitive tests. We excluded patients who had undergone neurosurgery.
Register linkage
Since 1968, all Danish citizens have been assigned a unique 10-digit identifier, the civil 
registration number (the CPR number), which is the key to individual information in all 
official registries covering the Danish population.30 Within Statistics Denmark, the CPR 
number enables the linkage between Danish registries, including the Danish National Patient 
Register. The Danish National Patient Register comprises data on surgeries performed in 
Danish hospitals since 1977 along with data on diagnoses. Until 1996, the Danish National 
Board of Health’s Classification of Surgeries was used to classify surgeries, and from 1996, 
the Nordic Classification of Surgical Procedures (NCSP) was used. Data on outpatients and

 emergency patients was added in 1995.31 Thus, the register has nation-wide coverage and is 
considered to have high validity, especially with regard to surgical procedures.32
Exposure assessment
The exposure group encompassed twins who had at least one surgical procedure within 18 to 
24 years before intake cognitive examination. The exposure group was separated into four 
groups by type of surgical procedure taking into account the severity of the underlying 
disease: 1) major surgeries, including cardiac, thoracic, laparotomy, central and peripheral 
vascular and major fracture surgeries, 2) knee and hip replacement surgeries, 3) minor 
surgeries, and 4) other surgeries. Minor surgeries included all-day only procedures, surgeries 
followed by less than two days of hospitalization and, independently of the first two criteria, 
surgery codes representing eye, skin, endoscopic procedures along with biopsies and other 
small surgical procedures. The classification was performed by two experienced 
anesthesiologists (TGH and LR), who, independently of one another, went through the 
records of surgery codes in the study sample for the period from 1977 and until intake 
examination (details can be found in Appendix 1). Twins who had more than one surgical 
procedure were assigned to the groups using the following algorithm: 1) major surgery if 
any, 2) knee and hip replacement surgery if any, but no major surgery and 3) other surgeries 
if any, but neither major nor knee and hip replacement surgery. The reference group in all 
analyses comprised twins with no surgical procedures from 1977 and until intake 
examination. The exposure was reassessed employing three more narrow time frames to 
assess whether time since surgery modified the association between exposure to surgery and 
cognitive performance: 1) two years 2) one year and 3) three months preceding intake 
examination.
Also the effect of cumulative exposures was investigated based on type of surgical 
procedures carried out from 1977 and until cognitive examination. Five exposure groups 
were defined according to both type and number of surgeries performed: 1) minor surgeries, 
2) one major/other surgery, 3) two major/other surgeries, 4) three major/other surgeries and 
5) more than three major/other surgeries.
Outcome measurement
The outcome was cognitive functioning assessed by a five-component test battery. The 
specific tasks included in the test battery were 1) a category fluency task, in which 
individuals were asked to name as many animals as they could during a one-minute interval, 
2) forward and 3) backward digit span and 4) immediate and 5) delayed recall of a twelve-
item list. An overall composite measure of cognitive functioning was computed by adding 
the five standardized scores (using mean and standard deviation from participants aged 45–
49 years) of each of the five component tasks.33 The composite cognitive score has been 
used in a series of previous studies. It has been shown to be a valid, reliable and very age-
sensitive measure of cognitive functioning, though moderately stable over a two-year 
interval (.60), and it has a high internal consistency reliability (.75).33–36

 Covariates
Potential confounders were identified in other similar studies,5,37 including sex, age and 
educational attainment. However, as the effect sizes were similar regardless of whether 
educational attainment was included in the statistical model, this covariate was omitted in 
the analyses.
Intra-pair analyses
To address genetic and shared environmental confounding and to take preoperative 
cognition into account, intra-pair analyses were performed. The 8,503 twins in the study 
population consisted of 1,065 monozygotic pairs and 1,179 dizygotic, same-sexed twin 
pairs, as well as 4,015 twin individuals from opposite-sexed pairs and “single twins”, i.e. 
twins who had a co-twin who was either deceased or a non-participant. To avoid 
confounding by sex, the intra-pair analyses only included same-sexed pairs. To obtain the 
biggest contrast in exposure, the intra-pair analyses only included pairs in whom one had a 
history of major surgery and the other no surgery. Among the 1,065 monozygotic pairs, a 
total of 87 such pairs were identified, whereas the corresponding number for dizygotic twins 
was 124 among 1,179 pairs. Consequently, 211 exposure-discordant pairs were included in 
the intra-pair analyses.
Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics were expressed as means and standard deviations for continuous 
variables and as numbers and proportions for categories. The comparisons of composite 
cognitive scores between twins exposed for at least one surgery (major, minor surgery, knee 
and hip replacement surgery, other surgeries) before examination of cognitive functioning 
and twins not exposed were performed using multivariate linear regression models adjusting 
for sex and age at examination. The within-pair dependency of twin individuals was 
considered by estimating the standard errors using the cluster option of STATA (release 13). 
Model assumptions were checked by residual plots and quantile-quantile plots of residuals.
In the intra-pair analyses, the proportion of pairs in which the co-twin who had been 
exposed to anesthesia and major surgery also had the lower composite cognitive score was 
calculated including the 95% confidence interval using the binomial distribution.
Results
A total of 8,527 Danish twins with a valid cognitive score were included: 4,309 of 4,314 
from the MADT (< 70 years) and 4,218 of 4,731 from the LSADT (≥70 years).
Of these participants, 65% had at least one surgery preceding intake examination. We 
excluded 24 twins with neurosurgery from the study: 10 from the MADT and 14 from the 
LSADT, reducing the sample sizes to 4,299 and 4,204, respectively (Table 1).
Major surgery was slightly more common in twins aged 70 years and above compared with 
twins younger than 70 years (20% vs. 17%). The unadjusted mean cognitive scores varied 
slightly between exposure groups, whereas the cognitive scores were substantially lower for 
older compared to younger participants, as expected. However, twins aged 70 years and

 above with knee and hip replacement surgery had the highest cognitive score (1.68) of 
surgery groups (ranging from 0.88 to 1.68) and even higher than the reference group (1.24).
Compared with the reference group, twins with major surgery preceding intake examination 
had slightly lower cognitive scores when adjusted for sex and age (mean difference:−0.27, 
CI:−0.48;−0.06) (Table 2), which is equivalent to about one tenth of a standard deviation 
(Table 1), i.e., negligible effect size38. In contrast, we found that those with knee and hip 
replacement surgery had higher cognitive score at intake (mean difference: 0.35, CI:−0.18; 
0.87), although the difference did not reach significance. For twins with minor or other 
surgical procedures, no differences were found in cognitive score in comparison with the 
reference group. Analyses stratified on overall age (< 70 years and ≥70 years) yielded 
similar estimates.
To further illustrate the effect size associated with major surgery (0.1 SD), we analyzed 
separately one of the cognitive tests included in the cognitive composite score, namely the 
animal fluency test (i.e. mention as many animals as possible in one minute). Here, one tenth 
of a standard deviation corresponds to 0.7 named animal. In MADT, the mean number of 
animals named in one minute is 24.2, and this means that a tenth of a standard deviation 
lower score corresponds to 23.5, which represents a difference that must be considered 
clinically unimportant. In comparison, the difference in cognitive score between the group 
below 70 years and that above 70 years is about a 0.9 standard deviation (Table 1), which in 
the animal fluency test would correspond to a six-word difference.
We also analyzed data according to those who had undergone surgery up to two years 
(n=1,738), one year (n=1,109) or three months (n=391), respectively, preceding intake 
examination (Figure 1). Overall, the mean differences in cognitive scores in the surgery 
groups compared with those without surgery in the same periods were similar across strata. 
Although the majority of estimates did not reveal statistical significance, the results 
indicated no interaction of time since surgery with the association between surgery and 
cognitive score at intake examination. When we stratified on overall age (< 70 years and 
≥70 years), the analyses yielded similar estimates in each of the age groups.
In addition, analyses were stratified on type and number of surgical procedures to 
investigate the dose-response pattern of cumulative exposure to surgery and anesthesia on 
cognitive impairment (Table 3). We found that exposure to three or more surgeries was 
associated with significantly lower score, about one fifth of a standard deviation.
The intra-pair analysis of twin pairs in whom one had a history of major surgery and the 
other had no surgery was included to further adjust for genetic and shared environmental 
factors. In the analysis of all 211 discordant pairs, we found that the surgery-exposed twin 
had a lower cognitive score than the co-twin in 49% [95% CI: 42%; 56%] of the pairs 
(Figure 2), suggesting that it was as common to have the higher cognitive score when 
exposed to surgery as it was to have the lower cognitive score. When twin pairs were 
restricted according to the magnitude of the intra-pair differences in cognitive score to the 
top 75%, 50% and 25%, respectively, the analyses yielded similar results. This was also the 
case when the twins were stratified by zygosity (not shown).

 Discussion
In this study comprising 8,503 twins, major surgery was associated with a negligibly lower 
level of cognitive functioning. Thus, the study provides evidence against a clinically 
relevant association between exposure to surgical procedures and anesthesia and subsequent 
cognition in mid and late life.
Twins who had undergone major surgery had slightly lower cognitive scores, corresponding 
to one tenth of a standard deviation, compared with the reference group, but in the intra-pair 
analysis where genetic and shared environmental factors were adjusted for by design, no 
association was observed. Twins who had undergone hip or knee replacement had slightly 
higher cognitive scores, although not significantly so, whereas no differences were found in 
the minor or other surgery group when compared with the reference group.
The time interval between surgery and cognitive examination had no impact on effect sizes 
and no dose-response pattern for number of surgeries was found, albeit having had three or 
more major/other surgeries was significantly associated with a lower cognitive score 
corresponding to one fifth of a standard deviation.
Our results are reassuring in relation to long-term adverse cognitive effects of exposure to 
major surgery and anesthesia in adulthood for two reasons: First, effect sizes of one tenth to 
one fifth of a standard deviation are very subtle and may be clinically irrelevant; secondly, 
our large sample size ensures estimates with high confidence. Cognitive impairment is a 
feared aspect of aging,39 and thus our finding of a subtle yet persistent cognitive impairment 
following surgery and anesthesia may be a concern. However, the results from the intra-pair 
analysis and across surgical procedures suggest that factors other than surgery and 
anesthesia are important. In the intra-pair analysis, the association between major surgery/
anesthesia and cognitive score disappeared and along with evidence of high correlation in 
cognitive scores among twins,40 this suggest that long-term postoperative cognitive 
functioning is primarily determined by the preoperative cognitive functioning. The severity 
of the underlying diseases across surgery groups are diverse with the more severe diseases in 
twins belonging to the major surgery group (e.g. cardiac and vascular surgeries and 
laparotomies) than to the minor (e.g. eye and laparoscopic surgeries) and knee and hip 
replacement surgery groups. Thus, the observations of a lower cognitive score in the major, 
no difference in the minor and other surgery groups and even a higher score in the hip and 
knee replacement group in comparison with the reference group indicate that the underlying 
disease is a major determining factor.
There was a tendency to better cognitive scores in the hip and knee replacement group 
compared with all other groups including the reference group. This is most likely due to the 
fact that the best functioning individuals are offered hip and knee replacements. 
Furthermore, it could also be explained by reduction in pain and increased mobility after 
successful joint replacements and subsequent improvement in level of functioning.
Comparisons with other studies are hampered by differences in methodology, including 
differences in design, endpoints and of length of follow-up. The present study reports mean 
differences in composite cognitive score whereas most other studies report dichotomous

 outcomes, primarily incidence of POCD. Moreover, the present study has longer follow-up 
(up to 24 years) than other studies.41
Despite the methodological differences our findings across surgical procedures and in the 
intra-pair analyses are to a large extent in line with other studies that assessed cognition 
more than six months postoperatively.16,37,42 Still, a recent cohort study43 (n=192) found an 
increased incidence of POCD in surgical patients above 60 years compared with age-gender 
matched controls at one year postoperatively, and a meta-analysis of 17 studies44 concluded 
that no impairment in cognitive performance could be documented at three to six months 
after hip and knee replacement. However, only two small studies that included control 
groups assessed cognitive functioning at three months of follow-up in this meta-analysis, 
and that conclusion may therefore not be justified. Another study of 270 elderly patients 
undergoing elective orthopedic surgery found improvements in some verbal cognitive tasks 
including immediate and delayed verbal recall and either deterioration or no differences in 
other tasks at follow-up at approximately one year.45 Hence, our findings of a tendency to a 
slightly higher composite cognitive score in the hip or knee replacement group could be 
considered to be in agreement with these findings. However, caution in this interpretation is 
warranted as the effect size in our study is small and non-significant. In addition, even if 
surgery successfully treats chronic pain and restores both physical and cognitive functioning 
in this patient group,46,47 the recovery may take time and is only registered by longer 
follow-up.
Our finding of no effect of time interval between surgery and cognitive examination on 
effect sizes does not support the current evidence of a gradual resolution of POCD between 
three months and one to two years,6,37 but the confidence intervals are quite wide.
Exposure to three or more surgeries seemed to be a risk factor but may be explained by 
underlying disease(s) or complications after surgery. Interestingly, a cross-sectional study48 
found no association between number of general anesthetic exposures and cognitive deficits 
in 606 participants aged 75 years or more. Likewise, a case-control study of 1,010 
participants found no association between cumulative number of exposures of general 
anesthesia and AD.49
Major strengths of the present study are the use of study samples from population-based 
surveys retrieved from the Danish Twin Registry28 and the completeness of the Danish 
National Patient Register,31,32 which minimized the risk for selection bias. The Danish 
national health care system with no out-of-pocket expenses further minimizes bias from 
different access to health care depending on educational and socioeconomic factors that are 
known to be strongly associated with cognitive performance. On the other hand, the study is 
performed in a relatively homogeneous Northern European population, and thus the results 
should be replicated in other settings.
The large sample size of more than 8,500 twins is another strength as this enabled us to 
detect even very subtle cognitive score differences with high accuracy. In the literature there 
is a compelling body of evidence that twins are similar to the general population with regard 
to health and survival50–54 and in recent cohorts also with regard to cognitive functioning.55

 An observed, slightly lower cognitive functioning in older cohorts56 should not affect the 
associations in this study as the comparisons are conducted within a twin population. In 
addition, we have no reason to believe that the effect of surgery and anesthesia differs 
between twins and singletons and so, our findings are likely generalizable to the non-twin 
population.
The use of the co-twin design has a number of strengths. Firstly, it is statistically powerful, 
reflected in the narrow confidence interval on the effect measure (proportion of pairs in 
which the major surgery-exposed twin had the lowest score: 49%; 95% CI 42–56%) despite 
that only 211 pairs were included. Furthermore, the design controls for childhood 
socioeconomic status and genetic endowment, both known to be strongly associated with 
cognitive functioning in mid- and late life.57,34 Finally, due to the high correlation in 
cognitive performance within twin pairs, especially within monozygotic twin pairs, the co-
twin is the best matched control.
Even though we argued that the risk of selection bias is small in this study, selection bias 
due to mortality and non-attendance should be considered when interpreting the results. The 
non-attendance of 518 twins (6%) in the cognitive examination may be explained by severe 
cognitive or physical impairments.36 An explorative data analysis (not shown) revealed that 
non-attendees had 1.3 times higher odds of having had any surgery than attendees. Hence, it 
cannot be ruled out that a small fraction of surgery-exposed twins may be particularly 
susceptible to surgery and anesthesia or disadvantaged in other ways.
The cross-sectional design of this study did not allow us to consider selective mortality, i.e., 
those with cognitive decline may have less chance of surviving to the study intake. Results 
were similar when restricting the analyses to surgeries performed less than three months 
before intake and hence minimizing the risk of survival bias. We did not assess cognition 
preceding surgery/anesthesia. However, in the intra-pair analysis, preoperative cognition 
was taken into account to some degree as the intra-pair similarity of intelligence is high.40
Unmeasured co-morbidity is likely to represent an important factor for cognitive 
performance. If the operated participants have less co-morbidity than the non-operated 
(which may be anticipated among the oldest in the cohort since surgery is often not 
performed among those who are very frail) the surgery-cognition association will be 
underestimated. However, if the operated participants have more co-morbidity (which may 
be anticipated among middle-aged and younger elderly), the association will be 
overestimated. We see no such age-dependence in our study (Table 2). A limitation of the 
exposure measure is that information about outpatient procedures performed prior to 1995 is 
not available. This could mean inclusion of exposed cohort members in the unexposed group 
and tend to bias the results towards null. However, major surgery very rarely took place in 
an outpatient setting before 1995.
Finally, alternative explanations related to the cognitive measure used in this study should 
be considered in the interpretation of our findings. Low sensitivity may be associated with 
an inability to detect cognitive deficits that may have been picked up by other cognitive test 
batteries. It is noteworthy that the composite cognitive score used is shown to be very age-

 sensitive with a difference of 2.5 standard deviation from age 45 to age 90.33 Although the 
composite cognitive score does not capture exactly the same cognitive domains as the 
psychometric test batteries used to detect POCD, it reflects elements that are pivotal for 
daily living, including working memory.
In conclusion, exposure to major surgery and anesthesia was associated with a negligible 
reduction in cognitive functioning among middle-aged and elderly twins. This finding 
substantiates the current evidence of no long-term major adverse cognitive effect of surgery 
and anesthesia as the very large sample size along with the sensitive cognitive measure 
allow us to detect very subtle effect sizes.
