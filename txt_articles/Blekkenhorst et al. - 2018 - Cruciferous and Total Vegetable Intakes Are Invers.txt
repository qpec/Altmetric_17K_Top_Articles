Background-—Dietary patterns rich in fruits and vegetables are considered to reduce atherosclerotic disease presentation and are
reported to be inversely associated with subclinical measures of atherosclerosis, such as carotid artery intima-media thickness
(IMT) and plaque. However, the effect of vegetable intake alone, and relationships to specific types of vegetables containing
different phytochemical profiles, is important. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of total vegetable intake
and specific vegetables grouped according to phytochemical constituents with common carotid artery IMT (CCA-IMT) and carotid
plaque severity in a cohort of older adult women (aged ≥70 years).
Methods and Results-—Total vegetable intake was calculated at baseline (1998) using a validated food frequency questionnaire.
Vegetable types included cruciferous, allium, yellow/orange/red, leafy green, and legumes. In 2001, CCA-IMT (n=954) and carotid
focal plaque (n=968) were assessed using high-resolution B-mode carotid ultrasonography. Mean (SD) total vegetable intake was
199.9 (78.0) g/d. Women consuming ≥3 servings of vegetables each day had �4.6% to 5.0% lower mean CCA-IMT (P=0.014) and
maximum CCA-IMT (P=0.004) compared with participants consuming <2 servings of vegetables. For each 10 g/d higher in
cruciferous vegetable intake, there was an associated 0.006 mm (0.8%) lower mean CCA-IMT (P<0.01) and 0.007 mm (0.8%) lower
maximum CCA-IMT (P<0.01). Other vegetable types were not associated with CCA-IMT (P>0.05). No associations were observed
between vegetables and plaque severity (P>0.05).
Conclusions-—Increasing vegetables in the diet with a focus on consuming cruciferous vegetables may have benefits for the
prevention of subclinical atherosclerosis in older adult women.

H
igher vegetable intake is consistently associated with a
reduced risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.1 The
underlying cause of these cardiovascular disease subgroups is
atherosclerosis, a complex multifactorial disorder of the
arteries initiated by endothelial dysfunction, inflammation,
and dyslipidemia.2,3 Subclinical measures of atherosclerosis
include common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-
IMT) and carotid atherosclerotic plaques, both of which have
been shown to predict myocardial infarction and stroke.4–6
Diets high in vegetables, such as the Mediterranean-style
diet and the vegetarian diet, have been shown to be
associated with lower CCA-IMT7,8 and delayed progression
of atherosclerotic plaques.9 However, the role of individual
dietary components, such as vegetables, is uncertain.10

 Furthermore, given the heterogeneity of vegetables, there has
been little research investigating whether specific types of
vegetables are associated with a reduction in atherosclerosis.
Vegetables contain many nutrients and bioactive com-
pounds, such as phytochemicals that may slow the progres-
sion of atherosclerosis.11 Some of these naturally occurring
compounds include carotenoids, polyphenols, organosulfur
compounds, and nitrogen-containing compounds.12–15 Differ-
ent types of vegetables contain different levels of these
putative protective components. For example, cruciferous
vegetables, such as cabbage, brussels sprouts, cauliflower,
and broccoli, and allium vegetables, such as onions, leek, and
garlic, are rich sources of organosulfur compounds, which are
proposed to be beneficial for cardiovascular health.14 Another
example is leafy green vegetables, such as spinach and
lettuce, which are a rich source of the nitrogen-containing
compound, nitrate. Nitrate has been shown in clinical trials to
lower blood pressure,16,17 a major risk factor for cardiovas-
cular disease. If specific components have a greater protec-
tive role in atherosclerosis, then particular types of vegetables
rich in these components may confer a greater cardioprotec-
tive effect, as we have previously demonstrated.18
The primary objective of this study was to investigate the
associations of total vegetable intake and intake of specific
types of vegetables, grouped according to phytochemical
constituents previously outlined, with CCA-IMT and carotid
plaque severity in a cohort of older adult women. Because of
the potential for cocorrelation, the effects of individual dietary
confounders were studied.

Study Population
Participants (n=1500) for this observational study were
initially enrolled in 1998 to the CAIFOS (Calcium Intake
Fracture Outcome Study). The CAIFOS was a 5-year, double-
blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of daily calcium
supplementation (1.2 g calcium carbonate) to prevent osteo-
porotic fracture.20 Participants were recruited in 1998 from
the Western Australian general population of women aged
≥70 years. Invitations were sent by mail using the Electoral
Roll, which is maintained for all Australian citizens enrolled to
vote in Western Australia. All participants recruited into the
study were ambulant, with an expected survival beyond
5 years, and were not receiving any medication known to
affect bone metabolism (including hormone replacement
therapy). Participants were comparable in terms of disease
burden and medication use to the general population of
similar age but were more likely to come from a higher
socioeconomic status.21 A total of 39 of 1500 participants
(2.6%) of the CAIFOS received 1.2 g calcium carbonate plus
1000 IU of vitamin D (ergocalciferol) as part of a substudy.22
In 2001, a preplanned ancillary study was performed to
investigate the epidemiological determinants of CCA-IMT and
carotid atherosclerosis in 1154 of 1500 participants (77%).
The remaining women (n=346) had died, withdrew from the
study, or were unable to be scheduled. Both studies were
approved by the Human Ethics Committee at the University of
Western Australia, and written informed consents were
obtained from all participants.
Inclusion criteria for the current observational study
included all available exposure and outcome variables.
Exclusion criteria included no dietary data, implausible energy
intakes, and participants with prevalent atherosclerotic vas-
cular disease (ASVD) or diabetes mellitus. Dietary data were
available in 1146 of 1154 participants (99.3%). Implausible
energy
intakes
(<2100 kJ
[500 kcal]
or
>14 700 kJ
[3500 kcal] per day) resulted in 12 of 1146 participants
(1.0%) being excluded. Participants with prevalent ASVD
(n=107), diabetes mellitus (n=44), or both (n=15) at baseline
(1998) were excluded, leaving 968 participants for the carotid
plaque severity analysis and 954 participants for the CCA-IMT
analysis (n=14 with missing CCA-IMT data) (Figure 1). Preva-
lent ASVD and/or diabetes mellitus at baseline was an a priori
exclusion criteria to help avoid the possibility of reverse
causality, which may weaken the true association. Prevalence
of ASVD at baseline (1998) was determined from principal
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• In a cohort of older Australian women, a higher intake of
vegetables (≥225 g/d in comparison to <150 g/d) was
associated with a �5% lower common carotid artery intima-
media thickness.
• Cruciferous vegetables, including cabbage, brussels sprouts,
cauliflower, and broccoli, contributed the most towards this
beneficial effect.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Cruciferous vegetables are recognized to be a good source
of several nutrients and bioactive phytochemicals.
• This observational cohort study provides evidence of a
vascular protective effect.
• If supported by other studies, dietary guidelines should
highlight the importance of increasing consumption of
cruciferous vegetables for protection from vascular disease.

 hospital discharge diagnosis codes from 1980 to 1998 using
the Hospital Morbidity Data Collection, linked via the Western
Australian Data Linkage System. Diagnosis codes for ASVD
included ischemic heart disease (International Statistical
Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death, Ninth
Revision [ICD-9]/International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] codes 410–414);
heart failure (ICD-9/ICD-9-CM code 428); cerebrovascular
disease, excluding hemorrhage (ICD-9/ICD-9-CM codes 433–
438); and peripheral arterial disease (ICD-9/ICD-9-CM codes
440–444). These codes were defined using the manual of the
ICD-923 and the Australian Version of the ICD-9-CM.24
Prevalent diabetes mellitus at baseline (1998) was deter-
mined
using
medication
use.
Medications
were
coded
(T89001–T90009) using the International Classification of
Primary Care—Plus method.25
CCA-IMT and Carotid Plaque Severity
CCA-IMT and carotid plaque severity were assessed at year 3
(2001) using high-resolution B-mode carotid ultrasonography.
Ultrasounds were conducted by the same sonographer using
a standard image acquisition protocol.26 An 8.0-mHz linear
array transducer attached to an Acuson Sequoia 512
ultrasound machine (Mountain View, CA) was used. To
account for asymmetrical wall thickening, images were taken
from 3 different angles (anterolateral, lateral, and posterolat-
eral) of the far walls of the distal 2 cm of the left and right
common carotid arteries. The same technician conducted off-
line analyses on all end-diastolic images using a semiauto-
mated edge-detection software program. The mean and
maximum CCA-IMT (mm) from each of the 6 images (3 on
either side) were averaged to give an overall mean CCA-IMT
and maximum CCA-IMT. A short-term precision study was
undertaken in 20 nontrial subjects using the same sonogra-
pher and technician. Repeated IMT measurements were made
between 0 and 31 days apart (mean, 10.3 days). The
coefficient of variation for the repeated measures was
5.98% (calculated using the root-mean-square method).27
Focal plaques were then determined by examining the entire
carotid tree (CCA, carotid bulb, and internal and external
carotid). Carotid plaque severity was categorized according to
the degree of stenosis: less advanced (<25% stenosis) or
more advanced (≥25% stenosis).28
Dietary Intake Assessment
A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to
assess dietary intake at baseline (1998). This questionnaire
was developed and validated by the Cancer Council of Victoria
and was designed to assess usual dietary intake over a period
of 12 months.29–31 Food intake frequency was assessed by
10 frequency options, ranging from “never” to “≥3 times per
day,” and portion size was calculated using photographs of
scaled portions of different food types. Energy and nutrient
intakes were calculated by the Cancer Council of Victoria
using the NUTTAB 95 food composition database32 and were
supplemented by other data where necessary. Food items
(including 24 vegetable items) were individually calculated in
g/d by the Cancer Council of Victoria. A research assistant
supervised participants while completing the questionnaires
and provided food models, photographs, measuring cups, and
spoons for the accuracy of reported food consumption.
Total vegetable intake
Total vegetable intake was calculated per serving (75 g/d) on
the basis of the 2013 Australian Dietary Guidelines.33
Servings per day were then categorized into 3 categories
(<2, 2–<3, and ≥3 servings/day) with a similar number of
participants in each category. “Potatoes, roasted or fried,
including hot chips” was not included in total intake of
vegetables because hot chips are not recommended as part of
a healthy diet.33 “Potatoes cooked without fat” were included.
Vegetable types
Vegetables were grouped on the basis of the 2013 Australian
Dietary Guidelines33 and were modified relating to phyto-
chemical constituents, as previously described.18,34 Vegetable

 types included cruciferous (cabbage, brussels sprouts, cauli-
flower, and broccoli), allium (onion, leek, and garlic), yellow/
orange/red (tomato, capsicum, beetroot, carrot, and pump-
kin), leafy green (lettuce and other salad greens, celery, silver
beet, and spinach), and legumes (peas, green beans, bean
sprouts, alfalfa sprouts, baked beans, soy beans, soy bean
curd and tofu, and other beans).
Baseline Demographic and Clinical Assessment
Body weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters) were
assessed using digital scales and a wall-mounted stadiometer,
respectively. Participants were wearing light clothing with no
socks and shoes. Body mass index (kg/m2) was then
calculated. Questionnaires were used to assess physical
activity and smoking status. Physical activity (kJ/d) was
calculated using a validated method using the type of activity,
time engaged in the activity, and the participants’ weight.35,36
Smoking status was coded as nonsmoker or ex-smoker/
current smoker. Ex-smoker/current smoker was defined as
consuming >1 cigarette/day for >3 months at any time
during the participants’ life. Alcohol intake (g/d) was
assessed using the validated food frequency questionnaire,
as previously described. Socioeconomic status was calculated
using the Socioeconomic Indexes for Areas developed by the
Australian Bureau of Statistics. These indexes ranked resi-
dential postcodes according to relative socioeconomic advan-
tage and disadvantage. Participants were coded into 6 groups
from the top 10% most highly disadvantaged to the top 10%
least disadvantaged.37
A detailed medical history and list of current medications
were obtained from all participants and were verified by their
general practitioner, where possible. Medication use was
coded using the International Classification of Primary Care—
Plus method, which allows aggregation of different terms for
similar pathologic entities, as defined by the ICD-10 coding
system.25 Use of antihypertensive agents, statin therapy, and
low-dose aspirin was included in the multivariable models to
adjust for atherosclerotic-related risk factors, such as hyper-
tension and dyslipidemia. Baseline serum creatinine was
analyzed in 875 of 968 participants (90.4%) using an isotope
dilution mass spectrometry traceable Jaffe kinetic assay and
Hitachi 917 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim,
Germany).38
Estimated
glomerular
filtration
rate
was
calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology
Collaboration equation39 and was added to the multivariable-
adjusted models because this has been shown to predict
atherosclerotic disease in this cohort of older adult women.38
Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and
triglyceride concentrations were analyzed in 895 of 968
participants (92.5%) using a Hitachi 917 autoanalyzer (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was
calculated in 888 of 968 participants (91.7%) using the
Friedewald’s method.40
Statistical Analysis
An analytical protocol was produced before analysis. Statis-
tical significance was set at a 2-sided type 1 error rate of
P<0.05. All data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for
Windows, version 21.0 (IBM) and SAS software, version 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc). Normality was assessed for each variable
by observing whether the frequency distribution curves and
quantile-quantile plots showed evidence of a normal distribu-
tion. Descriptive statistics of normally distributed continuous
variables were expressed as mean�SD, nonnormally dis-
tributed continuous variables (physical activity, alcohol intake,
allium vegetable intake, nut intake, fish intake, processed
meat intake, and red meat intake) were expressed as median
and interquartile range, and categorical variables were
expressed as number and proportion (percentage). Differ-
ences in baseline characteristics and dietary intakes among
vegetable serve categories were tested using 1-way ANOVA
for normally distributed continuous variables and the Kruskal-
Wallis test for nonnormally distributed continuous variables.
The v2 test for independence was used to test for differences
in baseline characteristics and dietary intakes for categorical
variables.
Multivariate linear regression was used to investigate the
association between CCA-IMT (mean and maximum) and our
primary exposures of interest (total vegetable intake and
intake of vegetable types). The association between focal
plaque severity (less advanced versus more advanced) and
the same exposure variables was investigated using binary
logistic regression. Three models of adjustment were used in
each analysis: unadjusted, age and energy adjusted, and
multivariable adjusted (age, body mass index, level of physical
activity, alcohol intake, smoking history, socioeconomic
status, the CAIFOS supplementation group of calcium versus
calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo, use of antihyperten-
sive agents, statin therapy and low-dose aspirin, Chronic
Kidney
Disease
Epidemiology
Collaboration
estimated
glomerular filtration rate, and energy intake). Covariates were
entered into the models as continuous variables, with the
exception of smoking history, socioeconomic status, the
CAIFOS supplementation group of calcium versus calcium
plus vitamin D versus placebo, use of antihypertensive agents,
statin therapy, and low-dose aspirin, which were entered as
categorical variables. When assessing the association for
vegetable types, the total intake from other vegetables was
added to the multivariable-adjusted model as an additional
analysis. Covariates included in the adjusted models were
selected on an a priori basis because of their biological
relationship with cardiovascular disease.

 Sensitivity analysis
In addition to the fully adjusted models, we also considered the
potential for confounding from other dietary components.
Given the potential for multicollinearity between many of these
confounders, we considered their impact by entering them into
models separately, each as a continuous variable, for mean and
maximum CCA-IMT. These included daily intakes of total fruit
(g/d),41 fish (g/d), nuts (g/d), red meat intake (g/d), processed
meat intake (g/d), fiber (g/d), potassium (mg/d), magnesium
(mg/d), monounsaturated fat (g/d), saturated fat (g/d),42 and
vegetable-derived nitrate (mg/d).43 In addition, because potato
can be classified nutritionally as a starchy food, potatoes
cooked without fat were excluded from the calculation of total
vegetable intake and the fully adjusted models were reanalyzed
for mean and maximum CCA-IMT. Furthermore, vitamin D has
been associated with subclinical atherosclerosis44; we there-
fore excluded participants who had received 1.2 g calcium
carbonate plus 1000 IU of vitamin D (n=28) and then repeated
the fully adjusted models for mean and maximum CCA-IMT.
Last, because fruit also contains many phytochemicals thought
to benefit cardiovascular health,45 we explored the relationship
of total fruit intake (per serving, 150 g/d) with CCA-IMT (mean
and maximum) and carotid plaque severity using the 3 models
of adjustment previously described plus an additional model
further adjusting for total vegetable intake (per 75 g/d).
Results
Characteristics of Study Population
Participant demographics, medication use, and biochemical
analyses of all 968 study participants and by categories of
vegetable servings are presented in Table 1. Generally, higher
intakes of vegetables corresponded to higher intakes of other
foods and nutrients. Mean (SD) vegetable intake was 199.9
(78.0) g/d, and mean (SD) vegetable servings was 2.7 (1.0)
for all participants (Table 2). Proportional intakes of vegetable
types (including intake of potatoes and other vegetables) are
presented in Figure 2. Mean (SD) mean CCA-IMT was 0.778
(0.129) mm, and mean (SD) maximum CCA-IMT was 0.922
(0.152) mm. More advanced carotid stenosis (≥25%) was
present in 120 of 968 participants (12.4%), and less advanced
carotid
stenosis
(<25%)
was
present
in
848
of
968
participants (87.6%).
Common Carotid Artery Intima-Media Thickness
Total vegetable intake
In linear regression, for all models of adjustment, total
vegetable intake was inversely associated with mean CCA-IMT
and maximum CCA-IMT (Table 3). For each serving (75 g/d)
higher in vegetables, there was an associated 0.011 mm
(1.4%) lower mean CCA-IMT (P=0.014) and 0.016 mm (1.7%)
lower maximum CCA-IMT (P=0.002) after adjusting for
lifestyle and cardiovascular risk factors (Table 3). Similarly,
participants consuming ≥3 servings of vegetables each day
had �0.036 mm (4.6%) lower mean CCA-IMT and 0.047 mm
(5.0%) lower maximum CCA-IMT compared with participants
consuming <2 servings of vegetables (Table 3).
Vegetable types
In linear regression, for all models of adjustment, intake of
cruciferous vegetables was inversely associated with mean
CCA-IMT and maximum CCA-IMT (Table 4). This relationship
remained significant after further adjustment for noncrucifer-
ous vegetable intakes. Legume intake was not associated with
mean CCA-IMT. However, for maximum CCA-IMT, legume
intake was inversely associated in unadjusted (P=0.023), and
age and energy adjusted (P=0.044), models, but not the
multivariable-adjusted model (P=0.085). Intakes of allium,
yellow/orange/red, and leafy green vegetables were not
significantly associated with mean or maximum CCA-IMT
(Table 4).
Carotid Plaque Severity
Total vegetable intake and intake of vegetable types were not
associated with carotid plaque severity (Table 5).
Sensitivity Analyses
In the separate linear regression analyses that additionally
adjusted for individual dietary confounders, total fruit, fish,
nuts, red meat, processed meat, fiber, magnesium, and
monounsaturated fat did not change the interpretation of the
association between total vegetable intake and CCA-IMT
(Table 6). Adjustment for potassium and vegetable-derived
nitrate, however, both attenuated the association between
total vegetable intake and CCA-IMT. Adjustment for saturated
fat intake attenuated the association between total vegetable
intake and mean CCA-IMT, but not maximum CCA-IMT.
Similarly, in the separate linear regression analyses that
additionally adjusted for individual dietary confounders, total
fruit, fish, nuts, fiber, magnesium, monounsaturated fat, and

association between intake of cruciferous vegetables and

derived nitrate both attenuated the association between
intake of cruciferous vegetables and maximum CCA-IMT, but
not mean CCA-IMT. Exclusion of potatoes cooked without fat
from total vegetable intake did not change the interpretation
of the association between total vegetable intake and mean
CCA-IMT (unstandardized ß=�0.018, SE=0.006, P=0.004)
and

 SE=0.007, P=0.001). Furthermore, exclusion of participants
who had received 1.2 g calcium carbonate plus 1000 IU of
vitamin D (n=28) did not change the interpretation of the
association of total vegetable intake and intake of cruciferous
vegetables with CCA-IMT (mean and maximum) (Table 7).
Total fruit intake (per 150 g/d) was not associated with
mean CCA-IMT and carotid plaque severity in all 3 models of
adjustment (P>0.05 for all). There was evidence for an
association between total fruit intake (per 150 g/d) and
maximum CCA-IMT, but this was only statistically significant
in the unadjusted (unstandardized ß=�0.012, SE=0.006,
P=0.034)
and
multivariable-adjusted
(unstandardized
ß=�0.013, SE=0.006, P=0.042) models. Total fruit intake (per
150 g/d) was not associated with maximum CCA-IMT in the
age- and energy-adjusted model (unstandardized ß=�0.011,
SE=0.006, P=0.072) and in the multivariable-adjusted model
after further adjustment for total vegetable intake (per 75 g/d)
(unstandardized ß=�0.009, SE=0.006, P=0.166).

 Discussion
In this cohort of older adult women, we found that both total
vegetable intake and intake of cruciferous vegetables were
inversely associated with mean and maximum CCA-IMT.
These associations were independent of lifestyle and cardio-
vascular risk factors as well as other dietary confounders.
We observed a difference of 0.05 mm in maximum CCA-
IMT between high and low intakes of total vegetables. This is
likely to be clinically significant because a 0.1-mm decrease in
carotid IMT is associated with a 10% to 18% decrease in risk
of myocardial infarction and stroke.5 The results of our study
can be supported by a randomized controlled trial reporting a
slight regression in CCA-IMT with dietary changes, which
included an increased intake of fruit and vegetables over a 12-
month period.46 However, in observational studies, no
associations have been observed between intakes of vegeta-
bles alone and carotid IMT, and they suggest fruit intake may
be more beneficial.47,48 Fruit intake, however, did not
influence the association between total vegetable intake
and CCA-IMT in our study, and it was not itself an independent
predictor. Individual adjustments for potassium and veg-
etable-derived nitrate intakes did, however, attenuate the
association between total vegetable intake and CCA-IMT. This
suggests that at least some of the benefit from total vegetable
intake was mediated by these components, which are also
likely to influence vascular health.43,49–52

 There are many possible mechanisms to explain the
relationship between higher vegetable intake and lower CCA-
IMT. Vegetables have many important nutritive and nonnutri-
tive constituents that may contribute to vascular health.11
Phytochemicals have been postulated to have additional
benefits beyond basic nutrients. These include polyphenols,
which may play a role in scavenging free radicals that have
the ability to oxidize low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
infiltrated in the arterial wall.53 Organosulfur compounds
found abundantly in cruciferous vegetables may also play a
role.
Isothiocyanates

compounds

their

properties.14,54–56 However, accumulating evidence suggests
sulforaphane, a compound within the isothiocyanate group,
may have beneficial effects on vascular damage via the
blockade of oxidative stress and/or inhibition of advanced
glycation end products.57,58 There was strong evidence that
intake of cruciferous vegetables was inversely associated with

 mean CCA-IMT in this cohort, even after further adjustment
for noncruciferous vegetables and other food and nutrients
thought to be associated with cardiovascular health.
Focal carotid plaque severity was not associated with
vegetable intake in this cohort of older adult women.
Although CCA-IMT and carotid plaque are both intercorre-
lated,
they may reflect different
biological
aspects of
atherogenesis and are associated with different clinical
vascular outcomes.59 Carotid plaques are strongly related
to hyperlipidemia and myocardial infarction, whereas CCA-
IMT is more related to hypertension and ischemic stroke.59
This may be because of focal plaque size being dependent on
the influx of lipids into the plaque, whereas CCA-IMT captures
both
the
atherosclerotic
process
as
well
as
the
nonatherosclerotic
process,
such
as
the
compensatory
thickening of the carotid wall as a response to ageing and
hypertension.60
There are several strengths to this observational study.
Study participants were representative of older adult women
from the Australian population, with similar intakes of
vegetable servings.61 Furthermore, our study used 6 repeated
measurements for both mean and maximum CCA-IMT and
was shown to be highly reproducible, thereby reducing the
likelihood of measurement error in this variable. However,
since 2001, when the carotid ultrasounds were undertaken in
the CAIFOS, sonographic characteristic evaluations have
advanced (eg, surface irregularity, ulceration, and echogenic-
ity). These sonographic characteristics along with resistive

*Vegetable servings were calculated on the basis of the 2013 Australian Dietary Guidelines of a vegetable serving equal to 75 g/d. Vegetable types included cruciferous vegetables
(cabbage, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and broccoli), allium vegetables (onion, leek, and garlic), yellow/orange/red vegetables (tomato, capsicum, beetroot, carrot, and pumpkin), leafy
green vegetables (lettuce and other salad greens, celery, silver beet, and spinach), and legumes (peas, greens beans, bean sprouts, alfalfa sprouts, baked beans, soy beans, soy bean curd
and tofu, and other beans). Carotid plaque severity was measured in 2001 (N=968). Results were analyzed by logistic regression.

 the study involving 1154 of the original 1500 women (77%)
recruited at baseline, particularly because this study was done
3 years after recruitment for the primary randomized con-
trolled trial. In addition, classification by 1 characteristic
results in differences in other characteristics, such as food
and nutrient intakes. For example, participants consuming the
highest servings of vegetables compared with participants
consuming the lowest servings of vegetables reported a 32%
higher energy intake, as well as most other foods and
nutrients. Only marginal weight differences were observed for
participants consuming the highest servings of vegetables
compared with participants consuming the lowest servings of
vegetables, even though there was a 32% higher energy intake
reported. This suggests either errors in reported food intakes
or, more likely, higher energy use. Last, only 1 measure of
food intake and 1 measure for subclinical atherosclerosis
were available; thus, the study resembles a cross-sectional
design more than a prospective design. The study was
conducted in older women only and, therefore, results need to
be replicated in men and younger cohorts.
In conclusion, we found that both total vegetable intake
and intake of cruciferous vegetables were inversely associ-
ated with CCA-IMT. These associations were independent of
lifestyle and atherosclerotic-related risk factors as well as
other dietary confounders. Increasing vegetables within the
diet with a focus on consuming cruciferous vegetables may
protect against subclinical atherosclerosis in older adult
women.
