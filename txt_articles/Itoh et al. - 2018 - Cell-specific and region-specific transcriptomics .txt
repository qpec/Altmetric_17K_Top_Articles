Changes in gene expression that occur across the central nervous
system (CNS) during neurological diseases do not address the
heterogeneity of cell types from one CNS region to another and are
complicated by alterations in cellular composition during disease.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is multifocal by definition. Here, a cell-specific
and region-specific transcriptomics approach was used to determine
gene expression changes in astrocytes in the most widely used MS
model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Astrocyte-
specific RNAs from various neuroanatomic regions were attained
using RiboTag technology. Sequencing and bioinformatics analyses
showed that EAE-induced gene expression changes differed between
neuroanatomic regions when comparing astrocytes from spinal cord,
cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus. The top gene path-
ways that were changed in astrocytes from spinal cord during chronic
EAE involved decreases in expression of cholesterol synthesis genes
while immune pathway gene expression in astrocytes was increased.
Optic nerve from EAE and optic chiasm from MS also showed
decreased cholesterol synthesis gene expression. The potential role
of cholesterol synthesized by astrocytes during EAE and MS is
discussed. Together, this provides proof-of-concept that a cell-
specific and region-specific gene expression approach can provide
potential treatment targets in distinct neuroanatomic regions during
multifocal neurological diseases.

T
he biology of cell types within the central nervous system
(CNS) differs between neuroanatomic regions serving dif-
ferent functional neurological pathways (1–3). Channel distri-
bution, neurotransmitters, and neurotrophic factors all differ by
functional neuroanatomic pathway (2), and regional differences
in astrocytes (1) and oligodendrocytes (3) have been shown. Thus,
molecular mechanisms underlying distinct disabilities may differ
based on the neurological pathway involved. Multiple sclerosis
(MS) is by definition multifocal, characterized by a variety of dis-
abilities affecting walking, vision, cognition, and fatigue, to name a
few. The incidence and severity of each disability varies from pa-
tient to patient. Accordingly, we hypothesized that a “one size fits
all” treatment may not be optimal to achieve neuroprotection in
MS. Rather, treatments tailored for each specific disability may be
more effective. This approach is challenging since elucidation of
gene expression changes in neuroanatomic regions associated with
each disability would be needed.
A neuroprotective treatment optimally designed for one dis-
ability may have maximal effects on one or two disabilities but
have only modest effects on other disabilities, thereby diluting
out effects on commonly used standard composites of all dis-
abilities in MS clinical trials. Accordingly, the discovery of
disability-specific targets should be accompanied by disability-
specific biomarkers. To this end, our group has recently used
MRI to create disability-specific atlases of gray matter loss in
MS, which revealed distinct localized gray matter atrophy in
clinically eloquent areas aligned with different disabilities (ref. 4;
see comment in ref. 5).
Previous methods of identifying new molecular targets in
neurological diseases have largely entailed examining gene ex-
pression in whole CNS tissues from disease versus normal con-
trols in preclinical models of disease. Genes overexpressed or
underexpressed in disease models were then investigated in hu-
mans with disease as potential targets for new treatments. A
major limitation of this approach is that CNS tissues contain
multiple different cell types and that the composition of these
cell types is altered during disease. For example, in MS and its
preclinical model EAE, there is infiltration of immune cells,
proliferation and migration of progenitors, and damage or death
of oligodendrocytes and neurons. Thus, a difference in gene
expression during disease may reflect in part the difference in
cellular composition, confounding mechanistic insights into the
effect of disease on the biology of any given CNS cell. Exami-
nation of gene expression changes in whole CNS tissue may also
Significance
Molecular mechanisms underlying distinct disabilities during
neurological diseases may differ based on the neurological
pathway involved. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is multifocal, char-
acterized by distinct disabilities affecting walking, vision, cog-
nition, and fatigue. Neuroprotective treatments tailored for
each disability may be more effective than nonspecific treat-
ments aiming to reduce a composite of disabilities in clinical
trials. Here, we use the MS model to apply a cell-specific and
region-specific gene expression approach to discover targets in
distinct neuroanatomic regions. Altered cholesterol synthesis
gene expression in astrocytes in spinal cord and optic nerve
was identified as a potential target for walking and visual
disabilities, respectively. This disability-specific discovery ap-
proach represents a strategy for finding neuroprotective
treatments for multifocal neurodegenerative diseases.

 miss important changes in a subset of cells. Laser microdissection
of cells from the CNS and single cell RNA sequencing are valid
alternative approaches but have their own set of challenges (6–8).
Here, to determine changes in gene expression in a cell-
specific and region-specific manner during a multifocal neuro-
logical disease, we applied RiboTag technology (9) to the MS
preclinical model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE). Astrocytes were the cell of focus since the hallmark
multiple sclerotic lesions are based on astrocytic scarring, and
both beneficial and deleterious roles of astrocytes have been
shown in neuroinflammatory diseases, including EAE and MS
(1, 10–12). The RiboTag approach yields ribosomes with a tag
[hemagglutinin (HA)] in a specific cell type using Cre-loxP re-
combination (9). RiboTag mice were crossed with mice of the
mGFAP-Cre line 73.12 (13) to express HA-tagged ribosomal
protein only in astrocytes, and then astrocyte-specific RNAs
from different neuroanatomic regions were isolated and exam-
ined for changes in gene expression in astrocytes during EAE
using RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses. Regional
differences in the disease-related astrocyte transcriptome were
observed, and treatment targets were discovered in EAE and
confirmed in MS. Together, this represents an approach to
neuroprotective treatment development in MS that is based on
cell-specific and region-specific gene expression analyses.
Results
Specificity of Astrocyte mRNA Isolation. Colocalization of the HA
tag specifically with astrocytes in astrocyte RiboTag mice was
first shown at the protein level by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1
A–D). Efficiency of HA colocalization to astrocytes in spinal
cord at the protein level was 91.2%, as determined by the per-
cent area of HA staining that colocalized with GFAP staining.
RNA-seq analysis of astrocyte-enriched RNAs (immunopreci-
pitated by anti-HA antibody) confirmed enrichment of astrocyte-
specific gene expression, and deenrichment of neuronal, oligo-
dendroglial, and microglia-specific gene expression, shown as the
log fold change calculated between spinal cord astrocyte RNA
versus spinal cord total cell RNA (immunoprecipitated with
control antibody, anti-RPL22) (13) (Fig. 1E).
Regional Differences in Astrocyte-Specific Gene Expression During
EAE. EAE was induced in astrocyte RiboTag mice. Clinical
signs of EAE began at day 11 after disease induction, and mice
were killed at day 45 (mean EAE score = 3.1), as were age- and
sex-matched normal controls. Comparison was made between
RNAs from spinal cord astrocytes versus RNAs from spinal cord
all cell types using principal component analysis (PCA) graphed
three-dimensionally. Separation between spinal cord astrocyte-
specific RNAs versus spinal cord total cell RNAs was observed,
underscoring the difference between a cell-specific versus a
whole tissue gene expression approach (Fig. 1F). This was con-
sistent with the difference in the number of genes with sig-
nificantly [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.1] different expression
when comparing EAE versus healthy controls, with approxi-
mately twice as many significant genes from analysis of spinal
cord astrocytes (n = 2,015) compared with spinal cord all cells
(n = 1,168). Together, this demonstrated that many gene dif-
ferences in astrocytes in spinal cord during EAE are missed using
a whole tissue gene expression approach.
EAE-induced gene expression changes in astrocytes differed
between neuroanatomic regions when comparing astrocytes from
spinal cord, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus.
Compared with spinal cord astrocytes during EAE, gene ex-
pression in cerebellar astrocytes was distinct, but more similar to
spinal cord than cortical astrocytes and hippocampal astrocytes
(Fig. 1F). This separation between astrocytes derived from var-
ious regions of the CNS was observed in both EAE and normal
controls, consistent with the concept of regional heterogeneity of
astrocytes in normals (1), with this being an observation of re-
gional differences in gene expression in astrocytes during EAE.
The number of genes with significantly (FDR < 0.1) different
expression was highest in spinal cord astrocytes (n = 2,015)
compared with the other brain regions (cerebellum, n = 197;
hippocampus, n = 49; cerebral cortex, n = 20). See Dataset S1
for the list of significant gene differences with (FDR < 0.1) in
astrocytes of each region. The FDR < 0.1 threshold for differ-
entially expressed genes was based on previously published
analyses of RNA-seq data from astrocyte RiboTag mice (13).
Up-Regulation of Immune Pathway Gene Expression in EAE. Canon-
ical pathway analysis (Fig. 2 A–C and Table S1) of astrocyte-
specific RNAs differentially expressed in EAE versus normal
(FDR < 0.1) showed that genes involved in the antigen pre-
sentation pathway and the IFN signaling pathway were signifi-
cantly different in astrocytes from spinal cord (Fig. 2A) and
cerebellum (Fig. 2B). The change was in the direction of an in-
crease in gene expression in EAE compared with normal (Fig.
2D). Since antigen presentation by astrocytes in spinal cords of
EAE mice has been previously characterized (14, 15), this find-
ing validated the RiboTag approach.
Down-Regulation of Cholesterol Synthesis Pathway Gene Expression
in EAE. In spinal cord astrocytes, several cholesterol synthesis
pathways were significantly different in EAE compared with
normal, with these pathways dominating the profile of top
pathways in this cell type (Fig. 2A and Table S1). In contrast to
an increase in immune pathway gene expression in spinal cord
astrocytes, the direction of change for cholesterol synthesis
pathway gene expression was a decrease in EAE compared with
normal (Fig. 2D and Table S2). Cerebellar astrocytes also
showed numerous cholesterol synthesis pathways that were sig-
nificantly different during EAE compared with normal (Fig. 2B),
Fig. 1.
Enrichment of astrocyte-specific mRNA using RiboTag technology.
(A–D) Double immunolabeling in mGFAP-Cre:RiboTag mice showed coloc-
alization of ribosome associated HA-Tag (red) with the astrocyte-specific
marker GFAP (green), with colocalization seen in Merge (yellow). Nuclei
were counterstained with DAPI (blue) (40-μm-thick spinal cord sections). B–D

astrocyte-specific gene expression and deenrichment of neuronal, oligo-
dendroglial, and microglia-specific gene expression, shown as the log fold
change calculated between spinal cord astrocyte RNAs immunoprecipitated
by anti-HA antibody versus spinal cord total cell RNAs (including astrocytes)
immunoprecipitated with control antibody, anti-RPL22. Asterisks show the
significant enrichment or deenrichment (FDR < 0.1). (F) Principal component
analysis of astrocyte-enriched RNAs from four different brain regions (Cb,
cerebellum; Crx, cerebral cortex; Hippo, hippocampus; and Sc, spinal cord), as
well as RNAs from heterogeneous cells from spinal cord (RNA from all cell
types). The samples from all cells of spinal cord were markedly separated
from astrocyte-enriched spinal cord samples. Within astrocyte-enriched
samples, the samples from different brain regions were also separated.

 again with gene expression decreased during EAE (Table S2).
For cerebral cortex and hippocampus, the gene numbers with
FDR < 0.1 significance level were too few to run for reliable
enriched pathway analysis. The individual cholesterol synthesis
genes that were down-regulated in astrocyte-specific RNAs
during EAE in each region are listed in Table S2. When data
were further analyzed using FDR < 0.01 and FDR < 0.05, the
most significantly different pathways were the same as when
FDR < 0.1 was used.
Regarding genes within the cholesterol synthesis pathway (Fig.
S1), RNA-seq analyses showed robust down-regulation of 3-
hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase1 (Hmgcs1), farnesyl di-
phosphate synthase (Fdps), and farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyl-
transferase 1 (Fdft1) (Table S2). To validate these changes in
gene expression in astrocytes of spinal cord, another in-
dependent set of RiboTag mice had EAE induced, and astrocyte
gene expression in EAE versus control spinal cords was assessed
by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). Expression of all three cho-
lesterol synthesis genes was down-regulated in spinal cord as-
trocytes during EAE (Fig. 3A). Immunohistochemistry showed a
decrease in expression in spinal cord astrocytes in WT mice
during EAE at the protein level (Fig. 3B), and colocalization of
HMGCS1, FDPS, and FDFT1 with astrocytes was demonstrated for
each (Fig. 3C and Fig. S2). Finally, to further validate cell specificity
of our findings in astrocytes, neuronal RiboTag mice (rNSEII-Cre:
RiboTag) were created to assess gene expression in neurons during
EAE, and the decreases in cholesterol gene expression observed in
astrocytes did not occur in neurons (Fig. S3).
Focusing on White Matter Astrocytes: Optic Neuritis. Regional dif-
ferences in astrocyte gene expression during disease revealed
that genes in cholesterol synthesis pathways were decreased
more in spinal cord and cerebellum than in hippocampus and
cerebral cortex (Table S2), despite the fact that hippocampus
and cerebral cortex each have significant pathology during
chronic EAE, including an increase in reactive astrocytes (16–
21). The relative abundance of white matter in the first two re-
gions compared with the latter two regions suggested that as-
trocytes from white matter might drive the observed changes in
cholesterol synthesis gene expression during EAE. Since the
anterior visual pathway is known to be affected by optic neuritis
during EAE and contains only white matter, the astrocyte tran-
scriptome of optic nerve during EAE was determined. First,
colocalization of the HA label with GFAP in astrocytes of optic
nerve of RiboTag mice was shown (Fig. S4 A–D). Then, to assess
the enrichment of astrocyte-specific mRNA transcripts from
optic nerve, qPCR analyses of cell-specific gene expression
confirmed enrichment of astrocyte-specific gene expression and
deenrichment of oligodendroglial, microglial, and axonal-specific
gene expression (Fig. S4E).
Similar to astrocytes from spinal cord (Fig. 2A), astrocytes
from optic nerve during EAE showed a difference compared
with normal in several cholesterol synthesis pathways (Fig. 4A
Fig. 2.
Expression of cholesterol synthesis pathway genes is decreased and of immune pathway genes is increased in spinal cord astrocytes during EAE.
(A) Top canonical pathways are shown in spinal cord astrocytes (Sc-astr), (B) cerebellar astrocytes (Cb-astr), and (C) spinal cord all cells (Sc-all), each in
descending order of significance. Astrocyte-specific RNAs differentially expressed in EAE versus normal (FDR < 0.1) showed that genes involved in several
cholesterol synthesis pathways were significantly enriched in spinal cord and cerebellum (Table S1), with gene expression decreased in EAE (Tables S2 and S4).
The antigen presentation pathway and IFN signaling pathway were also significantly enriched in both regions (Table S1), with gene expression increased in
EAE (Table S4). Several pathways enriched in spinal cord astrocytes (Sc-astr) were not detectable in spinal cord all cells (Sc-all). n = 9 mice (5 EAE, 4 normal). Full
names of pathways are listed in Table S1. (D) Heat map of direction of change of genes in pathways. A heat map of cholesterol synthesis and immune
pathway genes that were significantly different between EAE and normal (NL) in astrocyte-specific RNAs (FDR < 0.1) revealed that cholesterol synthesis
pathway genes were decreased in EAE (green) while immune pathway genes were increased (red). Green color represents lower expression, and red color
represents higher expression. n = 9 mice (5 EAE, 4 normal). Significant differences in gene expression in spinal cord astrocytes were confirmed in another
independent set of astrocyte RiboTag mice using RNA-seq analysis with n = 10 mice (5 EAE, 5 normal).

 and Table S3). The direction of the change in cholesterol synthesis
pathway genes was decreased in EAE compared with normal as
shown in the heat map (Fig. 4B). This change in gene expression in
astrocytes of optic nerve by RNA-seq was then confirmed in an
independent set of RiboTag EAE mice where gene expression was
assessed by qPCR. Hmgcs1 and Fdft1, two cholesterol synthesis
genes in optic nerve that were found to be significantly down-
regulated during EAE by RNA-seq, were confirmed to be de-
creased in EAE by qPCR (Fig. 5A). Quantification of expression in
astrocytes in WT mice at the protein level also showed a decrease
during EAE (Fig. 5 B and C). Immunohistochemistry showed
colocalization of HMGCS1 and FDFT1 with astrocytes in optic
nerve (Fig. 5D and Fig. S5). FDPS was not decreased in optic nerve
during EAE by RNA-seq analysis and thus was not further assessed
by qPCR and immunohistochemistry.
Regarding inflammatory pathways in astrocytes in optic nerve
during EAE, astrocytes from optic nerve showed an increase in
expression of genes in the antigen presentation pathway as the
top pathway (Fig. 4A and Table S3), consistent with the antigen
presentation pathway being one of the top pathways in spinal
cord and cerebellar astrocytes (Fig. 2 A and B and Table S1).
However, unlike spinal cord and cerebellar astrocytes, optic
nerve astrocytes showed a highly significant difference in ex-
pression of genes in the complement system pathway (Fig. 4A
and Table S3), revealing region-specific differences in inflam-
mation in astrocytes during EAE.
Changes in Astrocyte Gene Expression in Early Versus Late EAE. While
our focus was on astrocytes during late EAE, we next asked
whether gene expression changes in astrocytes that were ob-
served late were also observed earlier during EAE. Using qPCR
for mRNAs from an additional set of astrocyte RiboTag mice,
we found that cholesterol synthesis gene expression was not
significantly decreased early during EAE (day 17) but was de-
creased late during EAE (day 50), in both spinal cord and optic
nerve, with each confirmed at the protein level by immunohis-
tochemistry in WT mice (Fig. S6 A, B, D, and E). Expression of
MHC class II of the antigen presentation pathway in astrocytes
was markedly increased in early EAE and then decreased late,
albeit still higher than normal (Fig. S6C). Early immune activa-
tion, with some persistence late, is consistent with previous lit-
erature showing that immune responses in the CNS during EAE
are not quiescent in chronic EAE in the C57BL/6 model (22–24).
Interestingly, optic nerve astrocytes showed an increase in MHC
class II early, and this did not decrease late (Fig. S6F).
Targeting Cholesterol Homeostasis as a Treatment for EAE. The
astrocyte-specific molecular signature of decreased cholesterol
synthesis pathways in EAE spinal cord, cerebellum, and optic
nerve suggested a novel target for treatment in EAE, namely
cholesterol homeostasis. During adulthood, astrocytes are the
main CNS cells producing cholesterols, with transport via apo-
lipoprotein E (ApoE) to neurons to make membranes and syn-
apses and to oligodendrocytes to make myelin (25). We
hypothesized that decreased cholesterol synthesis in astrocytes
during EAE could lead to decreased cholesterol transport. Thus,
we investigated CS-6253, an agonist for ATP-binding cassette
transporter A1 (ABCA1) that is known to increase efflux of
cholesterol to extracellular ApoE (26, 27). Since it was not
known whether treatment with CS-6253 could affect cholesterol
synthesis gene expression, astrocyte-RiboTag mice that either
had EAE or were normal were treated with either CS-6253 or
vehicle, and qPCR determined if CS-6253 treatment affected
cholesterol synthesis gene expression in astrocytes in spinal
cords. Significant increases in Hmgcs1, Fdps, and Fdft1 were
observed in spinal cords of CS-6253–treated EAE mice and also
in normal controls (Fig. 6A). Immunohistochemistry showed in-
creased expression of HMGCS1, FDPS, and FDFT1 at the pro-
tein level in CS-6253-treated versus vehicle-treated WT EAE
mice, with CS-6253–treated EAE mice demonstrating levels as
high as those in normal mice (Fig. 6B). Expression was principally
in astrocyte cell bodies, but also in astrocyte processes (Fig. 6C).

that several cholesterol synthesis pathways were different in EAE (Table S3),

antigen presentation pathway and complement system pathway were also
significantly different in EAE, but these were in the direction of an increase
in EAE (Table S4). (B) A heat map of cholesterol synthesis pathway genes that

 Finally, CS-6253–treated EAE mice had less severe EAE disability
compared with vehicle-treated, as shown by motor function using
standard EAE walking scores (Fig. 6D) and rotarod testing per-
formance (Fig. 6E).
Translation to Multiple Sclerosis. Translating our findings in optic
neuritis in EAE to humans, optic neuritis is common in MS.
Therefore, gene expression analyses of white matter tracts of the
anterior visual pathway in MS optic chiasm tissues were exam-
ined using MS brain autopsy tissues. We compared gene ex-
pression in five MS and five healthy age-matched controls (MS
mean age = 57.6 y, healthy controls mean age = 56.2 y; MS
disease duration mean = 20.4 y; MS and healthy control all fe-
male; see SI Materials and Methods for additional subject char-
acteristics). Cholesterol synthesis pathways were significantly
different in MS optic chiasm compared with healthy control
optic chiasm (Fig. 7A and Table S3), with cholesterol synthesis
gene expression decreased in MS compared with healthy controls
(Fig. 7B).
Discussion
RiboTag technology was applied to EAE to determine astrocyte-
specific gene expression networks in multiple regions of the
CNS. Our results provide proof of concept that unbiased bio-
informatics analyses of the molecular signature of gene expres-
sion during disease in a cell-specific and region-specific manner
can provide unique insights. Here, the study of astrocytes in EAE
unexpectedly pointed to cholesterol homeostasis. To explore
how a decrease in cholesterol synthesis in astrocytes might affect
demyelinating autoimmune disease, we reviewed known choles-
terol actions in the CNS. Peripheral cholesterol does not pass
through the blood–brain barrier; instead, cholesterols in the
brain must be synthesized de novo. The predominant CNS cell
that synthesizes cholesterol changes during development, with
synthesis by neurons at the embryonic stage, oligodendrocytes at
the postnatal stage, and astrocytes at the adult stage (25). In adult
brain, cholesterols synthesized in astrocytes are transported via
ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA1) to apolipoprotein E
(ApoE) to neurons and oligodendrocytes. Neurons use cholesterol
to make cell membranes and synapses (28, 29) while oligoden-
drocytes use cholesterol to make myelin (25, 30) (Fig. 8A). Thus,
we hypothesize that reduced cholesterol synthesis in astrocytes

Treatment targeting cholesterol homeostasis during EAE. EAE (blue)
and normal (NL, black) mice were treated with either Vehicle (Veh, solid) or
CS-6253 (CS, striped). (A) Quantification of cholesterol synthesis gene ex-
pression by qPCR using astrocyte-specific RNAs from CS or vehicle-treated
astrocyte RiboTag mice with EAE at day 43 showed that Hmgcs1, Fdps, and
Fdft1 expression were up-regulated in astrocytes in CS-treated normal mice
(P = 0.0117 for Hmgcs1, P = 0.0324 for Fdps, P = 0.0475 for Fdft1) and in CS-
treated EAE mice (P = 0.0059 for Hmgcs1, P = 0.0093 for Fdps, P = 0.005 for
Fdft1). n = 5 in each group. (B) HMGCS1, FDPS, and FDFT1 were also in-
creased in CS-treated EAE spinal cord astrocytes in WT mice at the protein
level using immunohistochemistry (P = 0.0008 for HMGCS1, P = 0.0002 for
FDPS, P = 0.00195 for FDFT1). n = 4 in each group. (C) Colocalization of
HMGCS1 (red) with GFAP (green) in astrocytes (yellow) in Merge, showing
the CS-mediated increase in HMGCS expression in astrocyte cell bodies and
processes. Shown are 10× images of ventral spinal cord white matter, Insets
at 40×. (Scale bars: 100 μm.) (D and E) CS treatment resulted in a reduction in
clinical EAE severity scores, which assess walking disability (P = 0.005 cumula-
tive disease index after EAE day 30, P = 0.013 all days; CS group n = 6, vehicle
group n = 7), and an increase in the number of seconds that mice could stay
on the rotarod (P = 0.0077), respectively, each compared with vehicle treat-
ment in EAE. For confirmation, an additional set of EAE mice underwent
treatment with CS-6253 or vehicle, again demonstrating improvement in EAE
scores (P < 0.0001 cumulative disease index after EAE day 30, P = 0.0006 all
days; CS group n = 7, vehicle group n = 9).

 during EAE may lead to reduced cholesterol available for trans-
port to neurons and/or oligodendrocytes. While demyelination and
synaptic loss are due to the autoimmune attack in EAE, limited
reparative synaptic plasticity and remyelination may be due in part
to reduced synthesis of cholesterol by astrocytes (Fig. 8B). Further
investigation of this hypothesis is now warranted.
Other effects of decreased cholesterol synthesis in astrocytes
during EAE are possible and not mutually exclusive. Another
purpose of the de novo synthesis of cholesterol in astrocytes is
neurosteroid production. Cholesterol is a precursor for estradiol,
progesterone, and testosterone. Neurosteroid production in the
CNS is known to be a neuroprotective response to brain injury
(31–34), and expression of neurosteroid receptors is increased in
MS brain (35). Sex steroids delivered systemically are lipophilic,
cross the blood–brain barrier, and are neuroprotective in MS
models (36–38). Thus, exogenous sex hormone treatments may
compensate for decreased neurosteroid production from cho-
lesterol in astrocytes during disease in MS models and perhaps in
MS clinical trials (39–43).
Consistent with our region-specific transcriptomics data, clin-
ical studies in MS have suggested that altered levels of choles-
terol precursors and oxysterols in blood and cerebrospinal fluid
may be biomarkers for neurodegeneration (44, 45). Treatment
with statins in MS clinical trials has focused on antiinflammatory
effects, but whether statins can enter the CNS during disease to
affect cholesterol homeostasis in astrocytes in a deleterious or
beneficial manner warrants investigation (46–48). Together, our
data in spinal cord and optic nerve suggest that targeting cho-
lesterol synthesis in astrocytes in MS may affect walking and
vision, respectively.
Regarding other MS disabilities, there are implications for
cholesterol metabolism in the hippocampus, given the associa-
tion of apolipoprotein E (apoE) allele inheritance in cognitive
disability in MS (49–51). Cognition is frequently affected in MS,
including hippocampal-dependent verbal and spatial memory
(52). Hippocampal atrophy and neuropathology have been
shown in EAE (18, 21, 53–55) and MS (56–58). However, we
found relatively few cholesterol gene expression changes in as-
trocytes in hippocampus in EAE. That said, an effect of disease
on cholesterol pathways in another cell type (neurons, oligo-
dendrocytes) in hippocampus during EAE remains possible.
Findings herein also have implications for the role of astro-
cytes in the immunopathogenesis of MS and EAE. It is known
that there are regional differences in local inflammatory infil-
trates in MS and EAE. There is diffuse and localized microglial
and astrocyte activation with high levels of T lymphocyte and
macrophage infiltration in white matter while there is diffuse
microglial and astrocyte activation with a relative paucity of lo-
calized T lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration in gray matter,
each accompanied by axonal and/or synaptic loss (11, 21, 59, 60).
Inflammatory infiltrates in EAE white matter can also vary
qualitatively from one CNS region to another (61–63). A central
question is whether differences in local inflammatory infiltrates
are responsible for regional differences in astrocyte gene ex-
pression, or whether regional differences in astrocyte gene ex-
pression are responsible for differences in local inflammatory
infiltrates. Either is possible as a causal driver of the other. Since
differences in gene expression in astrocytes exist in healthy states
in the absence of inflammation (1), regional differences in as-
trocytes could drive regional differences in immune infiltration
during EAE. For example, lipocalin2 (LCN2), an autocrine
mediator of astrocyte activation (64), drives expression of CCL2
and CXCL10 to promote microglia activation and peripheral
immune infiltration in optic nerve and spinal cord during EAE
(65–67). Here, the astrocyte transcriptome during EAE showed
that Lcn2 gene expression was increased in astrocytes from
white, but not gray, matter (Dataset S1). Conversely, differential

Cholesterol synthesis gene expression is decreased in optic chiasm in
MS. (A) Top canonical pathways in MS optic chiasm tissues. Pathway analysis
of optic chiasm from MS and healthy control patients showed that choles-
terol synthesis pathways were significantly different. n = 10 human (5 MS,
5 normal). Full names of pathways are listed in Table S3. (B) Heat map of
cholesterol synthesis pathway genes that were significantly different be-
tween MS and normal (NL) RNAs (FDR < 0.1) revealed that cholesterol syn-
thesis pathway genes were decreased in MS optic chiasm (green). Green
color represents lower expression and red color represents higher expres-
sion. n = 10 human (5 MS, 5 normal).
Fig. 8.
Hypothetical effect of reduced cholesterol synthesis in astrocytes
during EAE. (A) Peripheral cholesterols cannot enter into the CNS due to the
blood–brain barrier; thus, cholesterols in the CNS are synthesized de novo. In
adults, astrocytes are the main cells producing cholesterols (25), with
transport via ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA1) to apolipoprotein E
(ApoE) to neurons to make membranes and synapses (28, 29), and to oli-
godendrocytes to make myelin (25, 30). (B) In EAE, there is synaptic loss,
axonal damage, and demyelination (71). Here, we hypothesize that less
cholesterol synthesis in astrocytes during EAE may lead to reduced choles-
terol for transport to neurons and oligodendrocytes, thereby reducing re-
parative synaptic plasticity and remyelination.

 production of IFNγ and interleukin-17 (IL-17) in peripheral
immune cells has led to differential inflammation in white matter
regions during autoimmune inflammation (62, 63), and LCN2
expression in astrocytes could be induced by IFNγ, IL-17, and
tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (68, 69). Thus, these mechanisms are
not mutually exclusive and may coexist in a self-perpetuating feedback
loop. Regardless of causality, regional differences in astrocyte gene
expression and immune infiltration may provide a rationale for a
therapeutic strategy optimally targeting each region and its associated
disability.
In conclusion, discovery of cell-specific and region-specific
molecular signatures of disease in preclinical models can provide
novel targets tailored for each neurological pathway in MS as a
strategy to optimize neuroprotective treatment development.
Accordingly, a clinical trial designed to reverse the molecular
signature within a specific neurological pathway should have a
primary outcome measure sensitive to change in a specific dis-
ability, rather than a composite that pools different disabilities.
This disability-specific approach that begins with discovery and
ends with clinical trial design represents a strategy for finding
neuroprotective treatments, not only for MS but also for other
multifocal neurodegenerative diseases.
Materials and Methods
Mice. RiboTag mice (9) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice
expressing HA-tagged ribosomal protein RPL22 in astrocytes were generated
by crossing RiboTag mice with GFAP-Cre mice (13). All animal experiments
were approved by the University of California, Los Angeles Animal Research
Committee. Informed consent was attained for research involving human
autopsy tissues.
Active EAE Induction, Clinical Scoring, and Treatment. GFAP-Cre RiboTag mice
and WT C57BL/6 mice were induced with active EAE and scored, as described
(16). CS-6253 or vehicle treatment was started 4 d before EAE induction, as
described (70).
RNA Coimmunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation using mouse monoclonal
anti-HA antibody or rabbit anti-RPL22 control were as described (13), with
minor modification.
Quantitative RT-PCR and Immunohistochemistry. Standard procedures were
used to quantify gene expression (see SI Materials and Methods for primer
sequences) and to colocalize cholesterol synthesis gene expression with
GFAP, as described (10).
High Throughput Sequencing and Statistical Analysis. Astrocyte-specific tran-
scriptome (mouse) and whole tissue transcriptome (human) analyses were
performed using a high throughput sequencing approach.
Data Availability. Datasets are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ (SuperSeries accession no. GSE100330).
Further details on methods are provided in SI Materials and Methods.
