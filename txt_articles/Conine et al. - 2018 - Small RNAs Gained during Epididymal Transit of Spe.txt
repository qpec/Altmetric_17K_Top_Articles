 ABSTRACT 
The small RNA payload of mammalian sperm undergoes dramatic remodeling during 
development, as several waves of microRNAs and tRNA fragments are shipped to 
sperm during post-testicular maturation in the epididymis. Here, we take advantage of 
this developmental process to probe the function of the sperm RNA payload in 
preimplantation development. We generated zygotes via intracytoplasmic sperm 
injection (ICSI) using sperm obtained from the proximal (caput) vs. distal (cauda) 
epididymis, then characterized development of the resulting embryos. Embryos 
generated using caput sperm significantly overexpress multiple regulatory factors 
throughout preimplantation development, and subsequently implant inefficiently and fail 
soon after implantation. Remarkably, microinjection of purified cauda-specific small 
RNAs into caput-derived embryos not only completely rescued preimplantation 
molecular defects, but also suppressed the postimplantation embryonic lethality 
phenotype. These findings reveal an essential role for small RNA remodeling during 
post-testicular maturation of mammalian sperm, and identify a specific preimplantation 
gene expression program responsive to sperm-delivered microRNAs. 
 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
In sexually-reproducing organisms, the vast majority of inheritance is mediated by the 
two half-complements of genetic material carried by the gametes. However, beyond the 
DNA blueprint provided by the gametes, other factors delivered during fertilization are 
required to initiate embryogenesis, and to orchestrate a robust cascade of differentiation 
events required for multicellular development. Many maternally supplied factors have 
been demonstrated to be essential for development, as for example 1) mitochondria are 
strictly maternally-inherited in the majority of species, 2) many maternally-supplied 
proteins and RNAs are required to initiate the first cellular division after fertilization, and 
3) defects in imprinted gene expression underly the failure of embryos with various 
paternal disomies in mammals. 
In contrast, due to the discrepancy in size of sperm and oocyte (one thousand-
fold or more in most organisms), it is generally believed that sperm contribute little or 
nothing to early development beyond their haploid genome, a small number of 
epigenetic marks that are not “erased” by maternal factors, and, in some organisms, the

 first functional centriole. That said, it is increasingly clear that the male gamete carries 
additional information that can affect offspring development (Rando 2012), and a 
growing number of studies in mammals have implicated sperm RNAs in control of early 
embryonic development and offspring phenotype. For example, embryos generated 
using Dicer cKO sperm exhibit defects in progression to the blastocyst stage of 
development, and these defects can be rescued by microinjection of purified sperm 
RNAs (Yuan et al. 2016). Moreover, we and others have found that paternal 
environmental conditions can alter the RNA payload of mature sperm, and in some 
cases injection of sperm RNAs has been shown to recapitulate either regulatory or 
physiological phenotypes induced in offspring of natural matings (Rassoulzadegan et al. 
2006; Fullston et al. 2013; Rodgers et al. 2013; Gapp et al. 2014; Rodgers et al. 2015; 
Chen et al. 2016; Sharma et al. 2016). Nonetheless, although small RNAs play key 
roles in well-characterized transgenerational epigenetic inheritance systems such as 
paramutation in maize and RNA interference in plants and worms (Fire et al. 1998; 
Hamilton and Baulcombe 1999; Volpe et al. 2002; Zilberman et al. 2003; Arteaga-
Vazquez and Chandler 2010), it remains unclear what functions are served by the small 
RNA payload of mammalian sperm upon delivery to the zygote. 
Developing mammalian sperm exhibit multiple rounds of small RNA dynamics, 
starting with two major waves of piRNA production during spermatogenesis in the testis 
(Li et al. 2013), followed by a global loss of piRNAs and gain of 5’ tRNA fragments 
(tRFs) that occurs during post-testicular maturation of sperm in the epididymis (Peng et 
al. 2012; Garcia-Lopez et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2016; Sharma et al. 2016). Mature 
sperm from the cauda (distal) epididymis, which exhibit progressive motility and are 
competent for in vitro fertilization, carry an RNA repertoire comprised chiefly of 5’ tRFs 
along with a smaller population (~10% of small RNAs) of microRNAs. In addition to this 
dramatic switch between the dominant small RNA species that occurs as sperm enter 
the epididymis, the abundance of specific small RNAs varies even between sperm 
obtained from the proximal (caput) vs. distal (cauda) epididymis (Figure 1A, 
Supplemental Figure 1) – while caput sperm already carry high levels of tRF-Glu-CTC 
and tRF-Gly-GCC, levels of the similarly-abundant tRF-Val-CAC are dramatically (>10-
fold) higher in cauda sperm than in caput sperm (Sharma et al. 2016). Levels of specific 
microRNAs also vary significantly during epididymal maturation of sperm, as for 
example microRNAs encoded in several genomic clusters, such as the X-linked miR-
880 cluster and the miR17-92 oncomiR cluster, are far more abundant in cauda sperm 
than in caput sperm and appear to be delivered to maturing sperm by fusion with 
epididymosomes (Nixon et al. 2015; Sharma et al. 2016) (Supplemental Figure S1B).  
 
Here, we use the dramatic remodeling of the sperm small RNA payload that 
occurs during epididymal transit to probe the function of sperm-delivered RNAs in the 
zygote. Sperm were obtained from the caput and cauda epididymis of the same animal,

 and matched zygotes were generated via intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). These 
zygotes were then developed to varying stages of preimplantation development for 
molecular characterization by single-embryo mRNA-sequencing, or transferred to 
surrogate mothers for further development. We find that caput-derived embryos 
significantly overexpress ~50 genes primarily encoding regulatory factors (RNA binding 
proteins and chromatin-associated factors), beginning at the 4-cell stage and persisting 
to the blastocyst stage of development. These preimplantation regulatory aberrations 
were accompanied by pleiotropic defects in implantation and post-implantation 
development, as caput-derived embryos transferred into surrogate mothers did not 
develop to term. Remarkably, defects in both early embryonic gene regulation, and in 
post-implantation development, could be rescued by microinjection of purified small 
RNAs from cauda epididymosomes into caput-derived ICSI zygotes. Finally, we show 
that microRNAs (or similarly-sized small RNAs), rather than the more abundant class of 
longer tRNA fragments, are the essential RNAs gained during epididymal transit. 
Together, our data reveal an essential role for epididymal RNA trafficking during post-
testicular maturation of sperm, and identify a specific molecular program that is 
controlled by sperm-delivered microRNAs in preimplantation development. 
 
RESULTS 
We take advantage of the dramatic remodeling of the sperm RNA repertoire that occurs 
during epididymal transit to interrogate the function of distinct RNA payloads in the 
zygote. Sperm were obtained from the caput and cauda epididymis of the same animal, 
and zygotes were generated via intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using these 
paired samples (Figure 1B). For convenience, we refer throughout to embryos 
generated using cauda epididymal sperm as either “cauda-derived” ICSI embryos, or as 
“Cauda” embryos, to distinguish between caput/cauda as descriptors of location and 
Caput/Cauda as compact descriptors of the embryo generation protocol. 
Focusing first on preimplantation development, we cultured Caput and Cauda 
embryos to varying developmental stages (2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst) 
for molecular characterization by single-embryo RNA-Seq (Ramskold et al. 2012; 
Sharma et al. 2016). Importantly, both fertilization rates and blastocyst progression 
rates were identical for caput and cauda sperm (Table S1), ruling out the possibility that 
sperm obtained from the caput epididymis are grossly defective (aneuploid, etc.) sperm 
in the process of being resorbed.

In addition to allowing us to generate embryos using caput sperm (which do not 
exhibit forward motility and are therefore not competent for in vitro fertilization), ICSI 
provides unprecedented temporal resolution for genome-wide analysis of early 
development, as the precise moment of fertilization is known (unlike in typical in vitro 
fertilization protocols). We therefore analyzed 2-cell stage embryos at two time points – 
18 hours and 28 hours post-fertilization – which span the maternal-to-zygotic transition 
(Table S2). This dataset faithfully documents the process of the major wave of zygotic 
genome activation (ZGA), revealing 5654 genes that significantly change in abundance 
from 18 to 28 hours (Figure 1C-D). Additional embryos cultured for intermediate times 
provided a finer temporal view of this process (Supplemental Figure S2). Confident in 
our experimental pipeline, we next compared data for Caput and Cauda 2-cell stage 
embryos to identify any gene expression phenotypes induced by the developmental 
differences in the sperm small RNA epigenome. However, the source of sperm used for 
ICSI had no significant effect on mRNA abundance in either 18 or 28 hour 2-cell stage 
embryos (Figure 1E-F). While it is possible that subtle yet meaningful changes in 
mRNA abundance occur that are not captured by single-embryo RNA-Seq, we conclude 
that any such changes must be quantitatively modest at this stage of development. 
 
Overexpression of multiple epigenetic regulators in Caput embryos 
We next turned to the single embryo RNA-Seq dataset for later stages of 
preimplantation development – 4-cell, 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst (Tables S3-4) – 
focusing first on the 4-cell stage. Here, we find a strong signature of differential gene 
expression, with 37 genes exhibiting significantly increased mRNA abundance in Caput 
embryos, relative to matched cauda-derived embryos (Figures 2A-B). These genes 
primarily encode regulatory factors, including RNA binding proteins (Hnrnpab, Hnrnpu, 
Pcbp1, Eif3b, Yrdc, Ythdf1, Srsf2, and Ybx1) and chromatin-associated factors 
(Smarcd2, Smarca5, Smarcc1, Trim28, and Ezh2). Not only were these genes 
upregulated at the 4-cell stage, but they (along with other RNA and chromatin regulatory 
genes – Grsf1, Alyref, etc. – that changed, but were not statistically significant, in the 4-
cell dataset) remained upregulated in 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst-stage embryos 
(Figures 2C-D, Supplemental Figures S3-4). The consistent behavior of these genes 
throughout preimplantation development provides extensive biological replication of this

 gene signature, giving us a high-confidence set of target genes affected by some aspect 
of post-testicular sperm maturation. In addition to the common gene expression 
signature observed across preimplantation development, a small number of genes were 
preferentially affected specifically at the blastocyst stage, with decreased levels of 
Upp1, Utf1, and Tdgf1, and increased levels of Gata6, in Caput blastocysts (Figure 2D, 
Supplemental Figure S4B). Together, our preimplantation RNA-Seq data reveal robust 
effects of sperm maturation on expression of a group of RNA and chromatin regulators, 
with these early expression changes potentially contributing to later effects on signaling 
and gene regulation in the blastocyst. 
 
Caput-derived embryos exhibit multiple defects in post-implantation development 
Interestingly, the significant regulatory changes observed in early embryos do not 
impact overall preimplantation development – we achieved identical rates of fertilization 
and blastocyst progression for ICSI using caput and cauda sperm (Table S1). This 
raises the question of whether the significant molecular alterations observed in early 
development might result in any overt later phenotypes, such as defects in post-
implantation development, or altered physiology in resulting offspring. To address this 
question, we generated Caput and Cauda embryos by ICSI using paired sperm samples 
as described above, cultured the embryos to the 2-cell stage, and then surgically 
transferred 10-20 embryos into pseudo-pregnant surrogate mothers (Figure 3A). 
Although we initially set out to characterize phenotypes in offspring of these 
experiments, to our surprise none of the females implanted with Caput embryos ever 
gave birth (Figure 3B). This was not a defect in our embryo transfer procedure, as we 
readily obtained healthy litters from matched transfers of cauda-derived ICSI embryos 
carried out under identical conditions. Given that Caput embryos are perfectly capable 
of progression to the blastocyst stage (Table S1), we conclude that caput sperm carry a 
functional haploid genome (e.g. they are not aneuploid, or heavily oxidatively damaged), 
and instead that caput sperm may lack some epigenetic factor required for normal post-
implantation development. 
At what stage do Caput embryos fail during post-implantation development? We 
initially noted that recipient females carrying Caput embryos do not exhibit the increase 
in size typical of gravid females, suggesting that the defect occurs relatively early in 
pregnancy. We therefore repeated ICSI with caput and cauda sperm and transferred 2-
cell stage embryos as before, but rather than allow the embryos to go to term we 
dissected the embryos from the uteri at embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5). Figure 3C shows all 
embryos recovered from a typical pair of embryo transfers, with Cauda embryos yielding 
a number of large, normally-developing embryos, along with a few defective embryos. In 
contrast, we obtained many fewer Caput embryos at this stage of development, and the

 majority of these exhibited clear growth defects. We quantified several features of peri-
implantation development, finding that the decrease in the number of healthy caput-
derived embryos was a result of defects at multiple stages: Caput embryos exhibited 
fewer implantation sites in the recipient uterus (for the same number of transferred 
embryos), a higher fraction of embryos were resorbed, and the small number of 
developing embryos more often exhibited gross delays in developmental progression 
(Figure 3D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that, in our hands, Caput 
embryos exhibit a pleiotropic defect during or soon after implantation (see Discussion).  
 
Molecular and developmental characterization of embryos generated using 
testicular spermatozoa 
The failure of Caput ICSI embryos to develop to term is quite surprising in light of the 
fact that embryos generated using even more immature testicular sperm, or even round 
spermatids, are viable – this is a common method of assisted reproduction in humans 
(Greco et al. 2005; Tanaka et al. 2015). We readily confirmed this finding under our 
experimental conditions, successfully producing offspring from ICSI embryos using 
testicular spermatozoa (3/4 transfers yielding offspring), in contrast to 0/3 litters for a 
matched set of Caput embryo transfers. Given the ability of testicular sperm ICSI 
embryos to develop to term, we tested the prediction that the preimplantation regulatory 
aberrations observed in Caput embryos would not occur in Testicular embryos. 
Intriguingly, the altered gene expression program observed in Caput embryos was 
indeed absent in embryos generated using testicular spermatozoa (Figure 5A, 
Supplemental Figure S5), confirming that both testicular sperm and cauda epididymal 
sperm are capable of supporting similar embryonic development from fertilization to 
birth, while caput sperm – uniquely – cause the regulatory and developmental 
aberrations documented in Figures 2-3. These data suggest two likely hypotheses: 1) 
that sperm isolated from the caput epididymis represent a developmental dead end 
resulting from defects such as, eg, DNA damage, or 2) that epigenetic dynamics during 
early post-testicular development create a transiently-defective sperm population that is 
subsequently corrected during further epididymal transit. 
 
Small RNAs gained during epididymal transit rescue preimplantation defects in 
caput-derived embryos 
As Caput and Cauda ICSI embryos are identically successful through blastocyst 
development (Table S1), we set out to test the hypothesis that epigenetic differences 
between caput and cauda sperm are responsible for the preimplantation molecular 
alterations, and the defective post-implantation development, of caput-derived embryos.

 Cytosine methylation patterns are largely unchanged following their establishment 
during primordial germ cell development (Feng et al. 2010) – we have confirmed in 
whole genome surveys that genes in the Caput gene expression program are not 
differentially-methylated between caput and cauda sperm (unpublished data) – and the 
histone-to-protamine transition is already essentially complete in testicular spermatozoa 
(Gaucher et al. 2010). We therefore focused on the possibility that the dramatic 
remodeling of the sperm RNA payload that occurs during epididymal maturation (Figure 
1A) could be responsible for the effects we see here. To test this, we obtained cauda-
specific small RNAs by purifying 18-40 nucleotide RNAs from extracellular vesicles – 
epididymosomes – isolated from the cauda epididymis (Sharma et al. 2016). We then 
generated three sets of embryos: Cauda ICSI embryos, control Caput ICSI embryos 
injected with H3.3-GFP mRNA (to visualize successfully-injected embryos), and Caput 
ICSI embryos injected with cauda-specific small RNAs (as well as H3.3-GFP) three 
hours after fertilization (Figure 5A). Resulting embryos were cultured to the blastocyst 
stage and characterized by RNA-Seq (Table S5). 
Consistent with the first two replicate datasets and with data from earlier 
developmental stages (4-cell, etc.), this third blastocyst dataset again reveals 
upregulation of the same group of regulatory genes – Hnrnpab, Eif3b, Pcbp1, Gata6, 
etc. – in caput-derived embryos compared to Cauda embryos (Figure 5B). Strikingly, 
injection of cauda-specific small RNAs was sufficient to rescue the gene expression 
defects of Caput embryos, offsetting the overexpression of these regulatory genes 
(Figure 5B). More globally, cauda-specific small RNAs were able to almost completely 
restore Cauda-like gene expression in Caput blastocysts (Figure 5C). The complete 
suppression of the Caput preimplantation gene expression program by small RNA 
injections essentially rules out the possibilities that this altered regulatory program 
results from 1) defects in caput sperm such as aneuploidy or oxidative DNA damage, 2) 
cytosine methylation or chromatin differences between caput and cauda sperm, or 3) 
the absence of various proteins normally delivered to sperm during epididymal 
maturation (Sullivan et al. 2007; Krapf et al. 2012). 
 
What is the identity of the small RNAs responsible for rescuing the 
preimplantation regulatory defects in Caput embryos? As detailed extensively 
elsewhere ((Sharma et al. 2016) and Sharma et al, accompanying manuscript, 
summarized in Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure 1), caput sperm gain multiple 
small RNAs as they continue their transit through the epididymis. Cauda-specific RNAs 
most notably include several abundant tRFs (tRF-Val-CAC, tRF-Val-AAC), as well as 
~100 microRNAs, most of which are encoded in multi-microRNA genomic clusters (as 
in, eg, the X-linked miR-880 cluster, or the “oncomiR”17-92 cluster). To broadly 
separate the effects of cauda-specific tRFs from cauda-specific microRNAs, we gel-
purified 18-26 nt and 26-40 nt cauda epididymosomal RNAs to enrich for microRNAs

 and tRFs, respectively (Figures 6A-B). It is important to note that although this 
procedure greatly enriches the indicated RNA species (free of associated binding 
proteins), these preparations nonetheless represent complex RNA populations, as for 
example the “microRNA” fraction includes low levels of a variety of relatively short (<26 
nt) tRNA fragments (see Discussion). Purified small RNA populations were 
microinjected into caput-derived ICSI embryos as described above, and embryos were 
cultured to either the 4-cell stage or to the blastocyst stage for single-embryo RNA-Seq 
(Tables S6-7). 
 
These data once again confirmed the robust overexpression of Hnrnpab and 
various other genes involved in RNA and chromatin metabolism in Caput embryos. This 
Caput-specific gene expression program was unperturbed by microinjection of cauda-
specific tRFs, both for 4-cell stage embryos and for blastocysts (Figure 6C and 
Supplemental Figure S6B). Instead, we find that the suppression of the Caput 
preimplantation gene expression program by cauda-specific small RNAs could be 
recapitulated via microinjection of cauda-specific microRNAs (Figures 6C-D and 
Supplemental Figure S6). This was readily apparent for any individual Caput-specific 
target gene (Figure 6C, Supplemental Figure S6B), and more generally we find that a 
Cauda-like gene expression program was globally restored in caput sperm-derived 
embryos following microRNA injection (Figure 6D, Supplemental Figure S6C). 
Repression of Caput-induced genes was specific to cauda-specific microRNAs, as 
cauda-specific tRFs had no effect on these genes (Figures 6E-F). Taken together, 
these data demonstrate that the microRNAs gained by caput sperm as they further 
transit the epididymis are required to support normal preimplantation gene regulation. 
 
Cauda-specific small RNAs rescue development of caput-derived embryos 
Finally, as cauda-specific small RNAs were able to rescue the preimplantation 
molecular defects in caput-derived embryos, we sought to determine whether these 
RNAs could also rescue the post-implantation defects of these embryos. We therefore 
generated the same three sets of embryos described in Figure 5A – Cauda, Caput, and 
Caput+RNA – which were then transferred into recipient females as in Figure 3. As 
observed in Figure 3, we did not obtain any live births from the Caput embryos – across 
three different experiments we obtained 0 litters from 20 Caput embryo transfers (in 
contrast to 7/9 for Cauda embryos, or 3/4 for Testicular embryos). Astonishingly, 
microinjection of cauda-specific small RNAs suppressed the developmental lethality 
observed in the Caput embryos, as we obtained litters for 4 out of 7 embryo transfers 
(Figure 7). We conclude that the small RNAs that are gained as sperm transit from the 
caput to the cauda epididymis are essential to support proper development. Moreover, 
the ability of small RNAs to rescue the development of embryos fertilized using caput

 epididymal sperm provides further evidence that these sperm are not genetically 
defective, but are simply epigenetically immature. 
 
DISCUSSION 
Taken together, our data demonstrate that the dynamic remodeling of the small RNA 
payload of sperm that occurs during post-testicular maturation has dramatic functional 
consequences in the early embryo, and define a novel function for the epididymal 
maturation process beyond the established acquisition of sperm motility and 
competence for fertilization. We show that paternally-transmitted small RNAs function 
during preimplantation development to downregulate a set of genes encoding RNA-
binding proteins and chromatin-associated factors, and that proper acquisition of small 
RNAs by maturing sperm is essential for offspring development. Importantly, several 
lines of evidence rule out the hypothesis that sperm obtained from the caput epididymis 
represent defective sperm in the process of apoptosis or resorption, as 1) fertilization 
rates and blastocyst progression are identical for Caput and Cauda embryos, and 2) the 
developmental defects of Caput embryos can be rescued simply by small RNA 
microinjection. 
 
We are aware that our findings appear to contradict previous reports 
documenting successful generation of full-term offspring from Caput ICSI embryos in 
mouse (Suganuma et al. 2005) and (with extremely low ICSI success rates) in rat (Said 
et al. 2003). Focusing on the more comparable mouse experiments, we consider 
several potential explanations for this discrepancy. First, our studies differ in strain 
background – we used FVB rather than 129Sv animals – and it is plausible that this 
affects the ability of Caput embryos to implant. Second, Suganuma et al obtained sperm 
from 6-10 month old males, whereas we use 10-12 week old males. Third, the precise 
anatomical dissection of the caput epididymis could differ between our preparations – 
given that both testicular sperm and cauda sperm support full development in our hands 
as well as countless other reports, a caput epididymis dissection that included earlier or 
later sperm populations could result in greater developmental success of “caput sperm” 
ICSI embryos. That said, the comparable success rate for Caput and Cauda embryos 
reported by Suganuma et al makes this idea unlikely. Fourth, our protocols differ 
significantly in the embryos transferred to females, as Suganuma et al transferred 
morula/blastocyst stage embryos to the ampulla, whereas we transfer 2-cell stage 
embryos. It is plausible that multiple days of diapause experienced by blastocyst-stage 
Caput embryos as they transit the oviduct could potentially help overcome the deficits 
we observe in Caput embryos. Finally, we note that ICSI is typically performed with 
sperm heads, but sperm head isolation protocols differ in detail – Suganuma et al

 piezo pulses, and recovering the sperm head for injection. In rats, Said et al generated 
sperm heads by sonicating intact sperm. In contrast, we generate sperm heads en 
masse by drawing sperm repeatedly through a fine-gauge needle (Methods), and 
sperm heads from the resulting suspension are then picked for ICSI. It is likely that 
these protocols differ in the extent to which the injected sperm heads retain associated 
sperm components such as the midpiece, and it is therefore almost certain that the RNA 
contents differ between caput sperm head preparations. 
Whatever the reason for this discrepancy, we demonstrate here that injection of 
cauda epididysomal small RNAs reproducibly and completely rescues both the 
defective development and molecular gene expression phenotype exhibited by embryos 
fertilized with our caput sperm head preps. This is clearly most consistent with a model 
in which sperm small RNAs gained during epididymal transit have important regulatory 
functions during early embryonic development. 
 
A functional role for microRNA remodeling in the epididymis 
Sperm undergo at least two dramatic alterations to their small RNA payload during the 
process of post-testicular maturation in the epididymis – a global switch from a piRNA-
dominated payload in testicular sperm to a tRF-dominated payload in the epididymis, 
and a transient destruction or loss of a subset of microRNAs in caput sperm that is then 
countered by re-gain of these microRNAs in the cauda epididymis (Supplemental 
Figure S1). Two lines of evidence demonstrate that it is this latter process – the 
transient loss of genomically-clustered microRNAs – that causes the developmental 
aberrations in embryos generated using caput epididymal sperm. First, the robust 
overexpression of various regulatory genes is observed specifically in embryos 
generated using caput epididymal sperm, whereas embryos generated using testicular 
spermatozoa and cauda epididymal sperm exhibit much more similar gene expression 
programs (Figure 4). Moreover, in contrast to Caput embryos, we readily obtained 
offspring from both Cauda and Testicular ICSI embryos. As the loss of clustered 
microRNAs such as the miR-880 cluster is a transient feature specific to caput sperm – 
these microRNAs are abundant in all testicular sperm populations analyzed from 
primary spermatocytes to mature spermatozoa, and are similarly-abundant in cauda 
sperm – the strong similarity between Testicular and Cauda embryos pointed to the 
possibility that these microRNAs might play a role in early embryonic gene regulation. 
Second, fractionation of the cauda-specific small RNA payload based on RNA length 
confirmed that microRNAs (or, less likely, relatively low-abundance fragments of mature 
tRNAs that are shorter than the primary population of 28-36 nt tRNA cleavage products) 
are responsible for supporting normal gene expression in Cauda embryos, as re-
introduction of this purified RNA population was able to almost completely suppress the

 overexpression of regulatory genes in caput-derived embryos (Figure 6). Moreover, in 
ongoing studies we have been able to obtain viable offspring from Caput ICSI embryos 
injected with this microRNA fraction (2/4 transfers). We note that although our gel-
purified “microRNA” fraction includes additional RNA species including relatively short 
tRNA fragments, the absence of the Caput regulatory aberrations in embryos generated 
using testicular sperm – which have yet to gain appreciable tRFs, but which express the 
microRNAs in question – strongly argues that it is indeed the microRNAs in this fraction 
that rescue the developmental deficits in Caput embryos. 
 
These data identify a functional consequence for a surprising epigenetic 
remodeling event – transient elimination of a group of genomically-clustered microRNAs 
– recently documented to occur during post-testicular sperm maturation (Sharma et al. 
2016). This process bears a curious similarity to the global erasure and re-
establishment of cytosine methylation patterns that occurs following fertilization, and 
again during primordial germ cell development, in mammals (Feng et al. 2010). The 
purpose of this microRNA turnover is unclear, although as caput sperm are not 
transferred to the female during natural mating and in any case are incapable of 
fertilization – caput sperm do not exhibit forward motility – we do not anticipate that this 
process normally plays any role in control of offspring phenotype. Nonetheless, together 
with a prior report demonstrating that defective blastocyst progression of embryos 
generated from Dicer cKO germ cells can be rescued with sperm RNAs (Yuan et al. 
2016), our findings provide very strong additional evidence that the mammalian sperm 
RNA payload is functional upon introduction to the zygote. 
 
The identity of the small RNA(s) responsible for repression of the various RNA 
and chromatin regulatory genes identified here remains to be determined. Roughly ~100 
microRNAs present at >50 transcript per million abundance in cauda sperm are at least 
2-fold less abundant in caput sperm (Sharma et al. 2016), and extensive examination of 
predicted microRNA targets reveals no strong single candidate microRNA as a common 
regulator of the various Caput-upregulated target genes. We note two broad possible 
explanations for the observed Caput gene expression profile. First, given the number of 
differentially-abundant microRNAs, it is plausible that multiple distinct microRNAs each 
repress expression of a small number of relevant target genes – that, for example, miR-
17 represses Grsf1, miR-881 represses Hnrnpu, etc. Alternatively, one specific 
microRNA-mediated regulatory event could cause a broad downstream regulatory 
program, as for example repression of a single signaling protein or a transcription factor 
could result in altered expression of the ~50 target genes observed here. Beyond 
microRNA targeting of some upstream regulator, the altered gene expression program 
could be a physiological response to a global cellular defect such as, for example, 
decreased nuclear pore formation, altered nuclear exosome activity, etc. Given that the 
Caput-specific gene expression program is comprised of a strikingly coherent set of

 chromatin and RNA regulators, we favor the latter possibility – that the Caput gene 
expression program represents a cellular response to some upstream cellular defect – 
but this remains to be identified.  
 
Together, our data demonstrate that paternally-transmitted small RNAs are 
functional in the early embryo and are essential for proper development. It will be 
interesting to determine the direct targets of sperm microRNAs in the zygote, the course 
of events that leads to downregulation of various regulatory factors during early 
development, and the specific molecular events responsible for facilitating proper 
postimplantation development. Finally, although embryos generated using immature 
testicular sperm are viable in mouse and humans, given that testicular sperm carry a 
very distinct small RNA repertoire from that of cauda sperm we suggest that the 
phenotypic consequences of ICSI bear further scrutiny, and our studies provide a 
possible interventional framework for offsetting potential issues.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) 
The caput and cauda epididymis of 8-12 week old FVB/NJ mice were dissected separately into 
PBS. Sperm were then released by making an incision in the epididymal tissue followed by 
squeezing to release the contents. To detach sperm heads from the tails (both caput and 
cauda), after collecting the sperm in PBS in an eppendorf tube, the sperm were spun at 10,000 
x g and washed once with PBS. The sperm were then resuspended in 500 µl PBS and then 
drawn through a 26G needle on a 1ml syringe between 20-30 times. The shearing force from 
being drawn in and out of the needle removes the sperm head from tail for the majority of 
sperm. The sperm were then washed twice in Nuclear Isolation Media (NIM) 1% PVA and finally 
resuspended in 100-500 µl NIM 1% PVA for use in ICSI.  
  
Females were superovulated by an intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of pregnant mare’s 
serum gonadotropin (PMSG; 5 IU) followed by an i.p. injection of human chorionic gonadotropin 
(hCG; 5 IU) 48 hours later. Eggs were then collected from the oviducts of the females 13-18 
hours later by placing the dissected ampulla of the oviduct into KSOM containing 3 mg/ml 
hyaluranidase to digest the cumulus cells away from the eggs. After several minutes in

 hyaluranidase the eggs were washed 4-5 times in KSOM, finally being placed in KSOM in a 
37°C incubator until injected. 
 
For ICSI, plates were made with drops of NIM with 1% Polyvinyl alcohol for washing the 
injection needle, drops of NIM 1% PVA with sperm, drops of FHM with 0.1% PVA for the eggs to 
be added to for injection, and finally covered with mineral oli. 15-25 eggs at a time were placed 
into the FHM 0.1% FHM drops of the injection plate for subsequent injection. Sperm heads were 
then picked and injected into the eggs. After completion of the ~20 injections, the injected eggs 
were maintained at room temperature for 5 minutes, washed 4 times in KSOM, and then 
cultured in KSOM in a 37°C incubator in 5% CO2, 5% O2, for development. The process was 
repeated for a total of 100-200 injections per day. 
 
18, 24, and 28 hours post-injection, 2-cell embryos were collected into TCL buffer with 
1% β−mercaptoethanol and then stored at -80°C for processing into single embryo RNA-
sequencing libraries. 4-cell, 8-cell, and morula embryos were collected at 46, 60 and 75 hours 
respectively. Blastocysts were collected 4-5 days after ICSI determined by the morphology of a 
typical mid-blastocyst stage.  
 
Epididymosome Small RNA Isolation and Injection 
Epididymosomes were prepared and RNA was extracted as previously described (Belleannee 
et al. 2013; Sharma et al. 2016). In brief, luminal contents of the cauda epididymis were 
centrifuged at 2000 × g to pellet sperm, and the resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 
10,000 x g for 30 minutes to get rid of cellular debris. Next the supernatants were subjected to 
an ultracentrifugation at 120,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 h (TLA100.4 rotor; Beckman). Pellets were 
washed in cold PBS and subjected to a second ultracentrifugation at 120,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 
hours. These pellets were then resuspended in 50 µl of PBS and used for RNA extraction.  
For epididymosome RNA extraction, the total volume of the samples were adjusted to 60 
µl with water. 33.3 µl of lysis buffer (6.4 M Guanidine HCl, 5% Tween 20, 5% Triton, 120 mM 
EDTA, and 120 mM Tris pH 8.0), 3.3 µl ProteinaseK (>600 mAU/ml, Qiagen 19131), and 3.3 µl 
water were added to the samples. The samples were then incubated, with shaking, at 60 °C for 
15 minutes on an Eppendorf thermomixer.  
 
One volume of water (100 µl) was then added and the sample transferred to a phase 
lock column (5 PRIME). For phase separation 200 µl of TRI Reagent (MRC inc) and 40 µl BCP 
(1-bromo-2 chloropropane, MRC inc) were added. The samples were then mixed by inversion 
10-15 times, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 RPM for 4 minutes. A second addition of TRI 
reagent and BCP was performed to further purify the RNA. The aqueous phase was then 
removed and transferred to a low binding RNase/DNase free microcentrifuge tube (MSP); 
followed by the addition of 20 µg of glycoblue (Ambion) and 1 volume (~200 µl) of Isopropanol. 
The RNA was then precipitated for 30 minutes or greater at -20°C, followed by centrifugation at 
14,000 RPM for 15 minutes at 4°C, and one wash with 70% cold Ethanol followed by

 centriguation at 14,000 RPM for 5 minutes at 4°C. Finally, the RNA was reconstituted in 10 µl 
water for gel size selection. 
 
 Total RNA was combined with an equal volume of Gel Loading Buffer II (Ambion), 
loaded onto a 15% Polyacrylamide with 7M Urea and 1X TBE gel, and run at 15W in 1X TBE 
until the dye front was at the very bottom of the gel (~25 minutes for Criterion minigels). After 
staining with SYBR Gold (Life Technologies) for 7 minutes, and destaining in 1X TBE for 7 
minutes, gel slices corresponding to 18-40 nucleotides were then cut from the gel. Gel slices 
were then ground (using a pipette tip or plastic pestle) and 750 µl of 0.3 M NaCl-TE pH 7.5 was 
added and incubated with shaking on a thermomixer overnight at room temperature. The 
samples were then filtered using a 0.4 µm Cellulose Acetate filter (Costar) to remove gel debris. 
The eluate was transferred to a new low binding microcentrifuge tube and 20 µg of glycoblue 
and 1 volume of Isopropanol (~700 µl) were added. Finally, samples were precipitated for 30 or 
more minutes at -20 °C. 
 
The resulting small RNA preps are almost certainly free of ribonucleoprotein complexes, 
as they are purified from acrylamide gels. Although they may contain other impurities (traces of 
acrylamide, etc.), the clear distinction between the “microRNA” and “tRF” preps in microinjection 
studies (Figure 6, Supplemental Figure S6, Supplemental Tables S6-7) strongly argues that 
the relevant activity of these preps is in the specific RNA populations purified. 
 
Three hours following ICSI fertilization, zygotes were transferred to an injection plate 
with FHM medium containing 0.1% PVA, and subjected to micromanipulation. Caput zygotes 
were microinjected with either H3.3-GFP mRNA (caput control) or H3.3-GFP mRNA plus 1 ng/µl 
epididymosomal gel-purified small RNAs (18-40 nts). RNA injections were carried out using a 
Femtojet (Eppendorf) microinjector at 100 hPa pressure for 0.2 seconds, with 7 hPa 
compensation pressure. After the microinjections, zygotes were washed 4-5 times in KSOM and 
placed back into culture. H3.3-GFP fluorescence was verified at the 2-cell stage as a marker for 
injection. 
Given an estimated microinjection volume of 10 picoliter using the Femtojet parameters 
described above, the epididymosomal small RNA concentration of 1 ng/µl was chosen to 
achieve delivery of roughly a single sperm’s payload of small RNAs to a given zygote. 
Unpublished titrations in parthenote injections suggest that small RNA effects on Caput-specific 
genes are robust over at least a 4-fold concentration range. 
 
 
Single embryo RNA sequencing 
Single embryo RNA-seq was carried out using the SMART-Seq protocol (Ramskold et al. 
2012). Data were mapped using RSEM after removing microRNAs, snoRNA, rRNA, and PCR 
duplicates. Embryos with fewer than 10,000 detected transcripts were removed from the 
dataset. For most analyses we focused on mRNAs with a median abundance of at least 10 tpm 
across the dataset.

HNRNPAB Immunofluorescence 
Caput and cauda ICSI embryos were collected at the mid-blastocyst stage and fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described in (Torres-Padilla 
et al. 2006). The primary antibody used was Alexa Fluor-647 conjugated anti-HNRNPAB 
(ab210053).  
 
E7.5 Embryo Dissection 
Noon of the day that a mating plug was observed was considered embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5) of 
gestation. E7.5 embryos were dissected in DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium) 
(Invitrogen, Cat. No. 31600-034) containing 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Atlanta 
Biologicals, Cat. No. S11150), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml) (Invitrogen, Cat. 
No. 15140-122) and 20 mM HEPES (Fisher, Cat. No. BP310).

small RNA populations (Nixon et al. 2015; Sharma et al. 2016). These sperm samples 
differ in the abundance of hundreds of small RNAs – shown here are prominent 
examples of relevant RNA species. The RNAs listed for caput sperm are present at high 
abundance in caput sperm and are generally maintained at high levels in cauda sperm, 
while those listed for cauda sperm are examples of small RNAs that are scarce in caput

abundance to Cauda levels, while tRFs had little to no effect on these target genes. See 
Supplemental Figure S6B for blastocyst-stage data. The clear difference between 
these matched RNA injections – both RNA samples should be free of contaminating 
proteins, and should include similar levels of any potential contaminants such as 
leftover acrylamide – demonstrates that the rescue activity is specific to 18-26 nt cauda 
epididymosomal small RNAs.

cases, data are shown for mRNAs which exhibit a log2 fold change of at least 0.5 in 
Caput vs. Cauda embryos (p<0.01, uncorrected for multiple hypothesis testing to 
include a greater number of genes – results are even more dramatic for the smaller 
subset of genes significant after multiple hypothesis-correction). For both 4-cell stage 
(E) and blastocyst-stage (F) data, cauda-specific microRNAs cause downregulation of 
Caput-induced genes, while tRFs have little to no effect on these genes (KS p value 
comparing microRNA and tRF effects < 10-15 for both datasets).

SUPPLEMENTAL FIGURE LEGENDS 
Supplemental Figure S1. Schematic of small RNA changes during sperm 
development and maturation. 
A) Top cartoon shows three populations of spermatozoa, from the testis, caput 
epididymis, and cauda epididymis. Bottom panels show schematics of the major small 
RNA changes across this developmental trajectory, such as the global transition from 
piRNAs to tRFs occurring as sperm enter the epididymis. Note that while the majority of 
tRFs have been shipped to sperm already in the caput epididymis, several highly 
abundant tRFs (including tRF-Val-CAC, tRF-Val-AAC, and others – (Sharma et al. 
2016)) are cauda-specific. Bottom panel shows schematic for microRNA dynamics in 
the epididymis. While many singleton microRNAs are relatively stable in abundance 
across these sperm populations, caput sperm do lose a wide variety of microRNAs 
(Nixon et al. 2015; Sharma et al. 2016), almost all of which are encoded in genomic 
clusters ranging from clusters of two (miR-15/16, etc.) to 100 kb-scale clusters with 
close to 20 miRNAs, such as the imprinted X-linked miR-880 cluster. Sperm transiting 
the epididymis then apparently re-gain a second round of these clustered microRNAs, 
which occurs via trafficking of epididymosomes from the surrounding epididymal 
epithelium (Sharma et al. 2016). 
B) Example of microRNA cluster dynamics in the epididymis. Data from Sharma et al 
2016 show abundance (in parts per million reads, on a log10 y axis) for microRNAs 
comprising the miR-880 cluster in testis, caput sperm, and cauda sperm. Caput to 
cauda differences in these and other clustered microRNAs have also been documented 
in (Nixon et al. 2015), and we have reproduced these observations and confirmed that

 these microRNAs are highly expressed in purified testicular germ cell populations 
including mature testicular spermatozoa (see accompanying manuscript). 
 
Supplemental Figure S2. Zygotic genome activation. 
A) Embryos were generated using ICSI and cultured for precisely 18, 24, or 28 hours 
following sperm injection into the oocyte. Embryos were then promptly harvested for 
single-embryo RNA-Seq. 
B) In an original pilot experiment, ICSI embryos were generated over the course of 
roughly six hours on a given day (on several different days), then harvested for RNA-
Seq 20 hours after the last sperm injection. These embryos thus span a poorly-staged 
time window of roughly 20-26 hours post-fertilization, providing samples that “fill in” 
temporal gaps between the 18, 24, and 28 hour embryos from (A). 
C) All 2-cell stage RNA-Seq. Embryos (columns) are sorted according to their 
correlation with the final ZGA (28 hours/18 hours) profile. The time of embryo collection 
is indicated as bars above the heatmap – long pink bars correspond to the relatively 
unstaged embryos. 
 
Supplemental Figure S3. Caput vs. Cauda comparisons for 8-cell, morula, and 
blastocyst stages. Scatterplots as in Figure 2A, for the indicated developmental 
stages. Two separate biological replicates, carried out nearly one year apart, are 
analyzed separately for the blastocyst stage. 
 
Supplemental Figure S4. Validation and further analysis of Caput embryo 
regulatory phenotypes. 
A) Immunofluorescence (IF) validation of Caput effects on HNRNPAB protein 
expression in the blastocyst. Four panels show HNRNPAB levels, normalized to the 
Cauda average, for ~50-150 individual nuclei (from at least eight blastocysts for each 
experiment) for cauda- and caput-derived blastocysts. 
B) Sperm origin does not affect cell fate allocation in blastocysts. Box plots are shown 
as in Figure 2C for three sets of lineage marker genes in blastocyst RNA-Seq data, as 
indicated. With the exception of the significant upregulation observed for the gene 
encoding the key primitive endoderm transcription factor GATA6, we find no evidence 
for changes in cell composition between Caput and Cauda blastocysts.

Supplemental Figure S5. Morula-stage gene expression in testicular ICSI 
embryos. Scatterplot comparing median mRNA abundance in Cauda (x axis) and 
Testicular ICSI (y axis) embryos, as in Figures 4C-D. More detailed analysis of this 
experiment will be presented elsewhere – most relevant for this study is the absence of 
the Caput-specific regulatory program in embryos generated using testicular 
spermatozoa. 
 
Supplemental Figure S6. Cauda-specific microRNAs rescue Caput defects in 
blastocyst-stage gene regulation. 
A) Schematic of microinjection experiments. As in Figure 6A, but embryos were 
cultured to the blastocyst stage for single-embryo RNA-Seq. 
B) Data for individual blastocyst-stage embryos, plotted as in Figure 6C. 
C) Scatterplot comparing Caput effects on mRNA abundance (x axis) with effects of 
cauda-specific microRNAs (y axis), plotted as in Figure 6D.
