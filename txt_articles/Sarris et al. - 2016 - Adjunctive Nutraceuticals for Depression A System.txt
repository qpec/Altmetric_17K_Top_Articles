Objective: There is burgeoning interest in augmentation
strategies for improving inadequate response to antidepres-
sants. The adjunctive use of standardized pharmaceutical-
grade nutrients, known as nutraceuticals, has the potential
to modulate several neurochemical pathways implicated in
depression. While many studies have been conducted in this
area, to date no specialized systematic review (or meta-
analysis) has been conducted.
Method: A systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane
Library, and Web of Science was conducted up to December
2015 for clinical trials using adjunctive nutrients for depression.
Where sufficient data were available, a random-effects model
analyzed the standard mean difference between treatment
and placebo in the change from baseline to endpoint, com-
bining the effect size data. Funnel plot and heterogeneity
analyses were also performed.
Results: Primarily positive results were found for replicated
studies testing S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), methylfolate,
omega-3 (primarily EPA or ethyl-EPA), and vitamin D, with
positive isolated studies for creatine, folinic acid, and an
amino acid combination. Mixed results were found for
zinc, folic acid, vitamin C, and tryptophan, with non-
significant results for inositol. No major adverse effects
were noted in the studies (aside from minor digestive
disturbance). A meta-analysis of adjunctive omega-3
versus placebo revealed a significant and moderate to
strong effect in favor of omega-3. Conversely, a meta-
analysis of folic acid revealed a nonsignificant difference
from placebo. Marked study heterogeneity was found in
a Higgins test for both omega-3 and folic acid studies;
funnel plots also revealed asymmetry (reflecting potential
study bias).
Conclusions: Current evidence supports adjunctive use of
SAMe, methylfolate, omega-3, and vitamin D with antide-
pressants to reduce depressive symptoms.

Augmentation strategies in depression treatment are being
increasinglyexplored,withagrowingrecognitionthatformany
people with a depressive disorder, full remission is either short-
lived or absent (1). Even in cases of beneficial response, sub-
syndromal symptoms may still persist (2). Augmentation and
combination approaches are often applied in clinical practice
to provide an enhanced mood-elevating effect (especially in
cases of perceived treatment resistance [3]), and this pre-
scriptive approach may involve multiple agents with antide-
pressant activity (4). The combining of two or more established
antidepressants may target different neurochemical pathways,
while augmentation approaches may involve agents that
work synergistically with the antidepressant (5). More novel
approaches may target nonneurotransmitter pathways to
provide adjuvant benefits that may ultimately improve mood
(e.g., reduction of inflammation [6]). Augmentation strategies
canbeinitiatedeitheratthestartoftreatmentorlater,ifthereis
insufficientresponsetomonotherapy.Thecoadministrationof
standardized pharmaceutical-grade nutrients, referred to as
nutraceuticals, may provide an effective and safe approach to
enhancing antidepressant effects, either by synergistically
augmenting a particular activity of an antidepressant medi-
cation(e.g.,enhancingreuptakeinhibition of monoamines)or
by providing a range of additional biological effects (7).
While the pathophysiology of depression is complex (and
still being unraveled), several key neurobiological mechanisms
underpinning the disorder have been considered germane
(monoamine impairment, neuroendocrinological changes, re-
duced neurogenesis, reduction-oxidation reaction [redox] and
bioenergeticsabnormalities,andcytokinealterationsconsistent
with chronic inflammation) (8, 9). Several nutrients are known
tohavecriticalinvolvementinbrainfunction,andsome,suchas
omega-3, zinc, and folate, have been shown to affect an array of
neurobiological processes that may be implicated in depression
(10). By targeting these key neurobiological pathways through
specific nutraceuticals, such adjunctive treatments have the
potential to augment the response to antidepressants.
While the potential of antidepressant augmentation with
nutraceuticalsiscompelling,onlyrecentlyhaveenoughclinical
studies become available to permit a clearer determination of
their effectiveness as augmentation agents. To our knowledge,
to date there have been no comprehensive systematic reviews

REVIEWS AND OVERVIEWS
 of this area or, where sufficient data exist, any specific meta-
analysis of these adjunctive studies. Our intention is to provide a
comprehensive and critical review of the literature, focusing
specifically on the current evidence for adjunctive use of nutra-
ceuticals with antidepressants for clinical depression, and to dis-
cuss their potential evidence-basedapplication in clinical practice.
METHOD
Search Strategy
PubMed, CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied
Health Literature), Web of Science, and Cochrane Library
databases were searched upto December2015. We lookedfor
human clinical trials by using the search terms “Depression,”
“Major Depressive Disorder,” “Major Depression,” “Mood,”
“Antidepressant,” and “SSRI” in combination with the search
terms “Adjunct,” “Adjunctive,” “Adjuvant,” “Augmentation,”
and “Add-on” in combination with a range of nutraceutical
searchtermsand14individualnutrientsknowntobeimportant
for neurological function, e.g., omega-3, folic acid, amino acids,
vitamins, and minerals. Clinical trial registers were searched
for relevant studies to cross-reference with the literature re-
view and to locate unpublished data. A forward search of the
identified articles was subsequently performed by using a Web
of Science cited reference search, in addition to hand-searching
the literature and reference lists, contacting authors and aca-
demic personnel for studies in the area, and searching the
Internet for “gray” literature (data, published or unpublished,
that is not readily accessible through the main databases).
Study Inclusion Criteria
We reviewed studies that reported uncontrolled, controlled,
or quasi-experimental human studies that used any adjunctive
(i.e., combined with pharmacotherapy) nutrient-based in-
tervention for either diagnosed major depressive disorder
(primary diagnosis or comorbid with another condition, e.g.,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer) or ongoing depression
(defined as current use of antidepressant medication and a
moderate or above-threshold level of depressive symptoms
according to a validated scale, e.g., a score above 17 on the
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAM-D]). Further, the
depression had to be either clinician-diagnosed or a primary
health issue (i.e., not depressive symptoms studied as a sec-
ondary outcome for any other primary medical condition). For
a study to be considered an “adjunctive study,” more than 95%
of the study participants must have been taking antidepressant
medication.Studiesthatwereopen-labelwithoutacontrol(e.g.,
an antidepressant-only group or single-blind dose variation
design) must have recruited participants with “nonresponsive”
or “treatment-resistant” depression (defined as no response
to current or additionally previous antidepressant medication
used for that depressive episode). Use of a recognized depres-
sion assessment scale was required for the primary depression
outcome. The studies were required to have a duration of
treatment of at least 21 days and a total sample size of .10 per
arm. Case studies were not included. Only English-language
articles since 1960 were included. No criteria were set for
gender, age, or ethnicity of participants. All articles that did not
meet these criteria were excluded. Studies were selected for
finalinclusionbymeansofconsensuswithintheresearchgroup.
Study Tabulation
Studiesweretabulatedinfourseparategroups:one-carboncycle
nutraceuticals, omega-3, tryptophan, and other nutraceuticals.
These were evaluated for dose, age, sample size, method,
coprescribed antidepressant medication, diagnostic criteria,
percentageoffemaleparticipants,completionrate,andwhether
the study revealed a significant effect in favor of treatment or
control condition (full data appear in the supplement accom-
panying the online version of this article). In the tables pre-
senting results, “1” is used to indicate a statistically significant
reduction in depression rating scores in the treatment group
compared with the control group at study endpoint, and “n.s.“
is used to indicate no significant difference in depression
rating scores between the treatment and control groups at
study endpoint. For open-label studies, “1” is employed if the
treatment significantly reduced depression symptoms on the
depression rating scale over the course of the trial compared
with baseline, and “n.s.“ is used if the treatment did not sig-
nificantly reduce depression symptoms on the depression
rating scale over the duration ofthe trial comparedto baseline.
This information is also summarized in text.
Statistical Analysis
A review of the studies was employed to determine whether
multiple studies with acceptable homogeneity and adequate
data were available to apply a meta-analysis. Homogeneity
sufficient for meta-analysis was defined as the availability of
more than two randomized controlled trials studying a ho-
mogeneous isolated nutraceutical compound at a therapeu-
tic dose for 21 days or more for the adjunctive treatment of
major depressive disorder. Such trials were available only for
omega-3 and folic acid. A random-effects model was used, as
the directional effect of omega-3 and folic acid in depression
has not yet been established. The model analyzed the stan-
dard mean difference between treatment and placebo in
the change between baseline and endpoint, combining the
effect size (Hedges g) data. Data were analyzed by means of
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, version 3 (Biostat,
Englewood,N.J.,2015).Thepooledeffectsizewas determined
by using a 95% confidence interval, while significance was
determined by z tests (significance was defined as a p value of
,0.05). Sensitivity analyses were conducted by comparing
the results in a fixed-effects model and by removing studies
with lesser homogeneity. A homogeneity test (Higgins I2)
and a visual funnel plot analysis were conducted to ascertain
whether the effect sizes came from a homogeneous source
(11), and a regression analysis was used to assess whether any
relationship between sample size and results occurred.
RESULTS
An initial search revealed 5,287 articles in the area, from
which 571 were indexed as clinical trials. From subsequent

 hand-searching of the abstracts, 60 potential studies were
revealed as being in the specific area of the systematic review.
Analysis of the full texts revealed 40 studies that met the in-
clusion criteria (see Figure S1 in the online data supple-
ment). Nine studies involved folic acid, methylfolate,
folinic acid, or a combination of folic acid and vitamins B6
and B12; eight involved tryptophan (or 5-HTP); four in-
volved S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe); eight involved
omega-3 (a combination of eicosapentaenoic acid[EPA] and
docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], EPA alone, or ethyl-EPA); two
studies each were found on zinc, inositol, vitamin C, and vi-
tamin D; and isolated studies were found for creatine, B12, and
an amino acid combination. Common trial lengths were 4, 6,
and 8 weeks (range 3–52 weeks), with a mean sample size of
63 participants (SD575; range 20–475) and a mean age of 44
years (SD511 years). The tables present results separately for
one-carbon cycle nutraceuticals (Table 1), omega-3 (Table 2),
tryptophan (Table 3), and other nutraceuticals (Table 4); the
expanded tables in the online data supplement provide ad-
ditional study features. Over two-thirds of the participants
were female (69%). Of the 40 studies reviewed, 31 were
randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trials.
Four studies had a 100% completion rate, with a mean overall
completion rate of 85%.
Most studies used the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis
of major depressive disorder, with the HAM-D being used in
29 studies (most of the others used the Beck Depression
Inventory or the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating
Scale). A variety of antidepressant pharmacotherapies were
used in the studies, which primarily used open inclusion of all
SSRIs or commonly specified prescription of fluoxetine, cit-
alopram, or escitalopram at adequate doses and durations. A
positive effect of the adjunctive intervention was revealed
in 68% of the clinical trials (including six out of eight omega-3
studies).
One-Carbon Cycle Nutraceuticals
Fifteen data sets in 14 studies were located concerning ad-
junctive use of nutrients involved in the one-carbon cycle:
SAMe, folic acid (or related forms: folinic acid, methylfolate),
B6, and B12 (Table 1). Eight of these were double-blind
randomized controlled trials, with seven studying open-
label augmentation after nonresponse to antidepressant
medication. Eight studies used DSM-IV criteria, two DSM-
III, three ICD-10, and the study by Syed et al. (25) made
diagnoses according to depression level. Sample size ranged
from 22 to 475, with the majority of studies having a pri-
marily female sample (two folic acid studies had samples
that were 85% [17] and 100% [19] female). Study lengths
ranged from 6 to 52 weeks. Dosage variance was found
among studies using oral SAMe (800 or 1600 mg/day) and
methylfolate (15 or 30 mg/day). The HAM-D was used in all
but four studies as the primary outcome measure. A range of
antidepressants were used by participants, with fluoxetine
being used solely in three studies. Ten out of the 15 trials
revealed an effect in favor of this class of nutraceuticals,
either over placebo or beyond baseline in nonresponsive
depression.
A sufficient number of folic acid studies were available to
perform a meta-analysis. Four sets of data on folic acid (0.5 to
10 mg) were included in the meta-analysis. Two out of the
four studies revealed a benefit in favor of folic acid; however,
the largest study (Bedson et al. [20]), with a robust sample of
475 subjects, revealed no significant difference from placebo.
The pooled data in a random-effects meta-analytic model
revealed a nonsignificant difference between folic acid
and placebo (p50.23; z51.19, 95% confidence interval [CI],
–0.31 to 1.29), with an inconsequential effect size (g) of
0.49 (Figure 1). Sensitivity analyses revealed that when the
disproportionately large study (20) (N5475) was removed,
the nonsignificant effect was maintained (p50.29). When a
fixed-effects model was adopted in place of a random-
effects model, the significance of the results was also not
altered (p50.78). A Higgins test revealed substantial het-
erogeneity among folic acid depression studies (I2593%,
p,0.001), with the funnel plot showing one marked outlier
study (17) (figure not shown); this reflects potential study
bias. A regression analysis showed no relationship between
sample size and the level of effect size (figure not shown).
While heterogeneity may be produced when folic acid and
methylfolate studies are combined, when the only methyl-
folate randomized controlled trial with available baseline
and end-point data (Papakostas et al. [24] trial 1/phase 1:
7.5 mg; trial 2/phase 1: 15mg)wasaddedtothemeta-analysis,
a similar nonsignificant effect was revealed (p50.25; z51.15,
95% CI, –0.22 to 0.83).
Omega-3
We located eight studies that met the inclusion criteria. All
studies were double-blind randomized controlled trials.
The trials involved EPA and DHA combinations (N53),
ethyl-EPA (N54), and EPA versus DHA (N51) (Table 2).
The range of EPA varied between 930 mg and 4.4 g
(commonly 1 to 2 g per day, which is a therapeutic dose).
The sample sizes of the study arms were generally modest
(full sample size range, 20–122), and all but one study (27)
had a majority of female participants. Study lengths ranged
from 4 to 12 weeks, with avariety of antidepressants used by
the participants. All studies diagnosed the depression by
means of DSM-IV criteria, except the study by Peet et al.
(31), who studied physician-diagnosed depression treated
with antidepressants.
Eleven sets of data were included in the meta-analysis
(including the four-arm Peet et al. study [31] and the three-
arm Jazayeri et al. study [32]). Seven out of the 11 data sets
revealed a benefit in favor of omega-3, but only six were
statistically significant. The pooled data in a random-effects
meta-analytic model revealed an effect size (Hedges g) of
0.61 (z52.63, 95% CI, 0.15 to 1.06), which was highly sta-
tistically significant (p50.009; Figure 1). Sensitivity analy-
ses revealed that when meta-analysis of the data was
restricted to EPA-inclusive studies (removing the DHA-only

 arm of the Mozaffari-Khosravi et al. study [29]), this effect was
slightly strengthened (g50.69, p50.007). When a fixed-effects
model was adopted in place of a random-effects model, the
significance of the results was p,0.001. Aside from the
methodological limitations of the generally small samples and
the samples defined by diabetes and coronary heart disease in
the studies by Bot et al. (33) and Carney et al. (27), re-
spectively, most of the other study elements were reasonably
consistent. A Higgins test, however, revealed substantial
data heterogeneity among the omega-3 depression studies
(I2582%, p,0.001), with the funnel plot showing three
outlier studies (figure not shown); this reflects potential
study bias. A regression analysis showed no relationship
between sample size and the level of effect size (data not
shown).
Tryptophan
Eight studies investigating the various forms of tryptophan
(including one 5-HTP study) were reviewed (Table 3). Many
of the earlier studies (six studies before 1990) used
DL-tryptophan, which is potentially less effective than
L-tryptophan, as the D isomer is inactive. One study used
L-5-HTP, the active precursor of serotonin and a derivative of
tryptophan, in conjunction with a tricyclic antidepressant.
The majority of studies (N57) were published before 1985
and used the diagnosis of “endogenous depression” (N54)
or “affective disorder” (N52). The HAM-D was used by
most studies to asses depression symptoms (N55), and two
studies used the Cronholm-Ottosson Depression Scale.

tween1969and1983,predominatelytricyclicantidepressants

 (N54) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (N52) were pre-
scribed in conjunction with tryptophan (or 5-HTP). Four
out of the seven tryptophan studies and the one L-5-HTP
study found a positive effect of the adjunctive treatment,
relative to placebo and/or acontrol condition. We considered
undertakingameta-analysisoftryptophanbutwereunableto
perform one because of missing raw data in many of the early
studies.
Other Nutraceuticals
Ten other studies involving a range of nutraceuticals were
located, but there were too few on specific nutraceuticals
for us to perform a meta-analysis (Table 4). Two studies
each tested zinc, vitamin C, vitamin D, and inositol; one
study used a mixture of amino acids, and one tested
creatine. All studies except one (47) were double-blind
randomized controlled trials ranging from 4 to 26 weeks.
All studies used DSM-IV to establish the depression di-
agnosis, and all but two studies used the HAM-D for as-
sessment. A range of antidepressants were coprescribed,
with the most common being fluoxetine (N53). In all
but one study (44), the majority of participants were fe-
male. The individual study findings demonstrated positive
and significant results for vitamin D (a separate negative
community-based, nonclinical trial notwithstanding [52]),
creatine, and an amino acid combination; mixed results for
zinc and vitamin C; and no significant benefit over placebo
for inositol.

ADJUNCTIVE NUTRACEUTICALS FOR DEPRESSION
 Safety
All the nutraceuticals were generally well tolerated; gas-
trointestinal symptoms (e.g., constipation, stomach upset,
and diarrhea) were the most commonly reported adverse
events across all nutraceutical groups (omega-3, one-carbon
cycle, andtryptophan). Acrossallstudies,the rates ofdropouts
due to side effects were very low (less than 2% of the samples),
further supporting tolerability.
Despite the mild nature of the adverse effects reported in
the included studies, nutraceuticals are not without risk
or serious safety concerns when used at high doses, over
long periods of time, and/or when combined with certain
medications. Potential carcinogenicity should be considered
regarding supplements containing folic acid, as higher
folate blood levels are linked to increased risk of prostate
cancer (53, 54). While meta-analyses have not revealed de-
finitive evidence for the association between folic acid sup-
plementation and a range of cancers (55), and adequate
folate consumption from vegetables and whole grains has
potential cancer-protective properties, high dosages of folic
acid may not be advised in people with cancer, since it in-
creases cell proliferation (56). Folic acid has also been
implicated in accelerating cognitive decline with age and
reducing the efficacy of particular antifolate drugs, such as
immunosuppressants (57).
Omega-3 also should be prescribed with caution in peo-
ple with prostate cancer, since a meta-analysis showed that
certain fatty acids may have an association with prostate
cancer risk (58). It should be noted that this association
was weak and further larger epidemiological studies are

 required toassessthiscomprehensively.Higher-doseomega-3
supplementation has also been suspected to increase bleeding,
impair immune function, increase lipid peroxidation, and im-
pair lipid and glucose metabolism (59). There is also evidence
that omega-3 likely increases LDL cholesterol concentrations,
butonlywhen dosages of DHA and combined EPA/DHA are
over 2 g/day (59).
SAMe has been associated with an increased risk of hy-
pomania or manic switching in depressed patients. However,
the switching has primarily been reported in patients with
a diagnosed bipolar disorder and with intravenous or
intramuscular administrations of SAMe (60, 61). The
phenomenon has not been observed in clinical trials of oral
administration of SAMe (62). Tryptophan and 5-HTP, when
used in conjunction with other serotonergic agents (such as
antidepressants, opioid pain medications), may cause a toxic
state, serotonin syndrome, due to an excess of serotonin in
the brain (63). Hypercalcemia and vascular calcification may
occur when vitamin D is used at high doses ($275 mg/day)
(64), while high doses of zinc (.25 mg/day) can lead to cop-
per deficiency (65). At doses above 1000 mg/day, vitamin C
has been linked to an increased risk of kidney stones in men
due to its conversion to oxalate and excretion in urine (66).
Caution is warranted when reviewing the safety data on
nutraceuticals, and manyofthesuggestedpotential risks have
not been revealed in randomized controlled trials or meta-
analyses.
DISCUSSION
The overall findings revealed a substantive number of human
clinical trials testing adjunctive nutraceuticals to augment
antidepressant activity in depression. Primarily positive re-
sultsinreplicatedstudieswerefoundforSAMe,methylfolate,
omega-3 (EPA or ethyl-EPA specifically), and vitamin D. Due
to positive isolated studies, tentative consideration may also
be extended to creatine and an amino acid combination.
Further research is needed to clarify whether zinc, vitamin C,
or tryptophan (or more specifically 5-HTP, the active pre-
cursor of serotonin) may be of value, while inositol is unlikely
to have any utility as an adjunctive antidepressant agent. It
should be noted, however, that previous findings suggest that
inositol may have an antidepressant effect as a monotherapy
agent rather than an adjunctive agent for depression (67, 68).

ADJUNCTIVE NUTRACEUTICALS FOR DEPRESSION
 Thefindingfromtheomega-3meta-analysisdemonstrates
that this augmentation approach significantly reduces de-
pressive symptoms beyond placebo and thus has potential
clinical and public health significance. As detailed in a recent
general meta-analysis, it is advised that EPA or ethyl-EPA
dominant formulas be used, as DHA may not be effective (69).
In summation, EPA-rich omega-3 fish oil may be recom-
mended for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive
disorder. In respect to folic acid and methylfolate, results
are less clear. As the meta-analysis revealed, folic acid
cannot be firmly recommended; however, the “active”
forms of methylfolate and folinic acid can be tentatively
recommended. It should be noted that while the review
included various formulations (folic acid, folinic acid,
methylfolate), the latter is a patented derivative that has
been the subject of several large-scale commercially spon-
sored clinical trials. There is a potential concern that com-
mercially sponsored trials may be biased toward positive
results. For example, a review by Perlis et al. (70) found
that industry-funded randomized controlled trials with a
reported conflict of interest were 4.9 times more likely
to report positive results. Regardless, the vast majority of
efficacy-focused biological medicine studies have commer-
cial sponsorship, and while there is the potential for inherent
bias, the methodology of these studies was rigorous.
All of the nutraceuticals reviewed in this article have
mechanistic antidepressant activity underpinning their use.
The one-carbon cycle agents (SAMe, folic acid/methylfolate,
B6/B12) are critical in the methylation processes of mono-
amines (71). In particular, SAMe may improve depressed
mood through enhanced methylation of catecholamines and
increased serotonin turnover, reuptake inhibition of nor-
epinephrine, enhanced dopaminergic activity, decreased pro-
lactin secretion,andincreasedphosphatidylcholine conversion
(72). Omega-3 (in particular, EPA) exerts antidepressant ac-
tivity potentially through modulation of norepinephrine, do-
pamine, and serotonin reuptake, degradation, synthesis, and
receptor binding; through enhancement of glutathione an-
tioxidant capacity (73); and through enhancement of cell
membrane fluidity (74).
Another possible explanation for the antidepressant effi-
cacyofthesecompoundsmayresidewiththeiranti-inflammatory
properties, which are well demonstrated with SAMe (75)
and EPA (76, 77). A recent double-blind monotherapy
randomized controlled trial (N5155) showed that patients
with major depressive disorder who have biomarkers of in-
creased inflammation (e.g., interleukins or C-reactive protein)
maybenefit from EPA over both placebo and DHA, compared
with those with low levels of inflammation biomarkers (78).
Zinc is one of the most prevalent trace elements in the
amygdala, hippocampus, and neocortex, and aside from having
anti-inflammatoryand immunological-modulating properties,
it is involved with hippocampal neurogenesis through up-
regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), while
also modifying N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and glutamate
activity (79, 80).
Amino acids are essential precursors of all proteins in-
volved in the manufacture of neurochemicals. In particular,
tryptophan (and particularly its derivative 5-HTP) is an es-
sential monoamine precursor required for the synthesis of
serotonin (81). Creatine plays a pivotal role in brain energy
homeostasis, and altered cerebral energy metabolism at a
cellular level may be involved in the pathophysiology of de-
pression(51).Oral creatinesupplementationmay modify brain
high-energyphosphatemetabolisminpeoplewith depression.
Inositol is incorporated into neuronal cell membranes as
inositol phospholipids, and it is the key metabolic precursor in
the phosphoinositide (PI) intracellular secondary messenger
cycle (82). The PI cycle is involved with a broad range of
neurotransmitter systems, including adrenergic, serotonergic,
dopaminergic, glutaminergic, and cholinergic receptor types
(83).ThepotentialexiststhatbothinositolandSSRIsconverge
on the same mechanism of action, as 5-HT2 receptors are
linked to the PI cycle signal transduction pathway (84). Re-
gardless of this preclinical activity, as reviewed above, this
effect was not manifested in adjunctive treatment studies.
However, as discussed above, inositol may have a greater ther-
apeutic effect as a monotherapy agent for depression (67, 68) or
for panic disorder (85).
Vitamin D can be considered a neurosteroid, with vitamin
D receptors being identified in areas involved with de-
pression, such as the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, and
substantia nigra (86).Vitamin Dhas beenrevealed to increase
the expression of genes encoding for tyrosine hydroxylase
(precursor of dopamine and norepinephrine) (86). Further, a
major dopamine metabolite in the striatum and accumbens
has been found in methamphetamine-treated animals ad-
ministered vitamin D (87). Vitamin C is an essential vitamin
involved in various neuroendocrine activities and is needed
for the production of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin
(88). An animal study showed that the coadministration of
vitamin C (1 mg/kg p.o.) potentiated the action of subeffective
doses of fluoxetine (1 mg/kg), thus providing a synergistic
antidepressant-like effect with an SSRI (89).
Themethodology ofthisreviewhas several limitations,and
general cautions regarding the findings need to be considered.
First, our search criteria were modestly restrictive, and
several excluded studies (i.e., case studies and trials with
non-English-speaking patients or those with general de-
pressive symptoms) were not included, and thus a more
expansive perspective might have been reached with their
inclusion. Becausemuchof the earlyliteratureon SAMeis in
Italian, it is not covered by this review. Readers are advised
to additionally consult the Italian literature on this nutra-
ceutical. Caution also needs to be extended to the findings of
some of the nutraceuticals (aside from omega-3, SAMe, and
folic acid/methylfolate) due to a limited number of studies
and the small sample sizes of the studies reviewed. Po-
tential publication bias was also revealed in the folic acid
and omega-3 meta-analyses (from funnel plot analysis), as
well as heterogeneity among studies (in respect to I2 anal-
ysis and marked differences in medications used, study

 lengths, nutraceutical dosages, and participant character-
istics). Several studies of treatment-resistant depression
were also open label, and while any effect beyond baseline is
of merit, the lack of placebo cautions interpretation of the
results. Lastly, the older studies did not provide compre-
hensive details of the methodology or the raw statistics, and
thus a more thorough assessment could not be achieved.
Caveats regarding the prescription of the nutraceuticals
relate to the quality of nutrient products (especially with
SAMe, though current formulations have potentially more
stable shelf-lives) and the correct formulation and dosage
(especially with omega-3). Expense may also be an issue in
the case of SAMe and methylfolate.
Nutraceutical applications in psychiatry are advancing,
as reflected in recent international collaborative consen-
sus and position statements discussing the potential of
nutraceutical use in psychiatry (10, 90) As noted, much
more work is needed, and while an evolving body of re-
search is strengthening the potential of nutraceuticals
(and dietary considerations) as an important element in
modern psychiatric practice, we are only beginning to
study their potential applications. A major barrier to this
field is the often unpatentable nature of these compounds,
and large-scale randomized controlled trials may be un-
feasible due to a potential lack of financial incentive.
Despite the challenges of soliciting non-industry-spon-
sored funding, randomized controlled trials with robust
sample sizes and the application of pharmacogenomic
and neuroimaging technologies to determine biomarkers
of response are now required. Finally, while the current
studies (whether as first-line therapy or in treatment-
resistant depression) were pooled in the present article, as
the database of this research expands, future subanalyses
potentially can be conducted assessing these individual
nutraceuticals as first-line agents.
Another area of potential interest is the use of combin-
ationnutraceuticals.Ourresearchgroupiscurrentlytestingan
adjunctivenutraceutical formulationinthe treatment ofmajor
depressive disorder not responsive to stable antidepressant
medication (7). Nutrients commonly work in concert, and as
detailed above, a range of nutraceuticals modulate several key
pathways involved with the pathogenesis of depression. The
formulation currently being tested (involving SAMe, ethyl-
EPA, zinc, folinic acid, and 5-HTP and relevant cofactors) may
provide an array of antidepressant action beyond that of iso-
lated approaches. In conclusion, as detailed above, several
nutraceuticals may hold a potential clinical application to
enhance the antidepressant effect of medications. Further, the
integration of nutraceuticals into clinical practice guidelines
should be considered, especially in circumstances where the
risk-benefit ratio may not justify the use of pharmacological
treatment (such as in mild symptom presentations and in the
treatmentofchildren,adolescents,andpregnantwomen[ifthe
nutraceuticals are established as safe]). While future research
needs to determine how this is applied to the individual (and
whether it is more pertinent in cases of nutrient deficiencies),
many nutraceuticals are low-cost options that are worthy of
clinical consideration.
