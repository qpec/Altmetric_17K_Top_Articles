In an effort to stem the rising tide of multi-resistant bacteria, researchers have turned
to niche environments in the hope of discovering new varieties of antibiotics. We
investigated an ethnopharmacological (cure) from an alkaline/radon soil in the area of
Boho, in the Fermanagh Scarplands (N. Ireland) for the presence of Streptomyces, a
well-known producer of antibiotics. From this soil we isolated a novel (closest relative
57% of genome relatedness) Streptomyces sp. capable of growth at high alkaline pH
(10.5) and tolerant of gamma radiation to 4 kGy. Genomic sequencing identified many
alkaline tolerance (antiporter/multi-resistance) genes compared to S. coelicolor M145
(at 3:1), hence we designated the strain Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1,
from the Greek, myro (fragrance) and phorea (porter/carrier). In vitro tests demonstrated
the ability of the Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1 to inhibit the growth of
many strains of ESKAPE pathogens; most notably carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter
baumannii (a critical pathogen on the WHO priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria),
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (both listed as high priority pathogens). Further in silico prediction of antimicrobial
potential of Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1 by anti-SMASH and RAST
software identified many secondary metabolite and toxicity resistance gene clusters (45
and 27, respectively) as well as many antibiotic resistance genes potentially related
to antibiotic production. Follow-up in vitro tests show that the Streptomyces sp.
myrophorea, isolate McG1 was resistant to 28 out of 36 clinical antibiotics. Although
not a comprehensive analysis, we think that some of the Boho soils’ reputed curative
properties may be linked to the ability of Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1
to inhibit ESKAPE pathogens. More importantly, further analysis may elucidate other key
components that could alleviate the tide of multi-resistant nosocomial infections.

INTRODUCTION
The global increase in multi-resistant ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus
aureus,
Klebsiella
pneumoniae,
Acinetobacter
baumannii,
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa,
and
Enterobacter species) has created an urgent need to develop replacement therapies. ESKAPE
pathogens are responsible for the top 6 health care-associated infections (HAIs) and many have

Boho’s Novel Streptomyces
been identified as priority antibiotic-resistant bacteria (Jelic et al.,
2016; Santajit and Indrawattana, 2016; Founou et al., 2017;
Tacconelli et al., 2018). Infections with multi-resistant pathogens
are extremely hard to treat and may spread throughout a
hospital or community environment (Jelic et al., 2016; Santajit
and Indrawattana, 2016). It was thought that developing new
antibiotics from combinatorial chemistry would be able to
eliminate these resistant bacteria. However, years of trials have
not produced anything like the number of new drugs necessary
to stem the tide of multi-resistant bacteria (Lewis, 2013). In
addition, the production of new antibiotics tapered off in the
early 1980s due to unfavorable market conditions which has led
to a crisis in the supply line of new antibiotics (Santajit and
Indrawattana, 2016; Founou et al., 2017). Normally, bacterial
infections are treated with the simplest, most effective antibiotics,
however, multi-resistant pathogens usually require treatment
with higher tier antibiotics or antibiotics of last resort (Santajit
and Indrawattana, 2016). There are no guarantees of success
with these treatments and they can involve expensive and
sometimes toxic chemotherapy. If all solutions fail, infections
by ESKAPE pathogens can lead to death of the patient and
a spread of multi-resistant strains. Antibacterial resistance
has now been detected for nearly all new antibiotics, even
those of last resort (Jelic et al., 2017; Li and Webster,
2018). As a consequence, the WHO have created an urgent
priority list for discovery of new antibiotics (Tacconelli et al.,
2018).
Current strategies to alleviate the shortage of new antibiotics
have turned to niche environments such as deserts, thermal
vents, and alkaline environments in the hope that they might
produce exotic varieties of current antibiotics (Sato et al., 1983;
Mao et al., 2007; Yucel and Yamac, 2010; Mohammadipanah
and Wink, 2015). Alkaline environments in particular have
proven to be a rich source of antibiotics, many derived from
Streptomyces bacteria (Sato et al., 1983; Yucel and Yamac,
2010; Behroozian et al., 2016; Maciejewska et al., 2016).
Together with other members of the phylum Actinobacteria,
Actinomycetes, are responsible for the synthesis of more
than half of modern medicines including antimicrobial, anti-
cancerous (Noomnual et al., 2016), antiviral (Yokomizo et al.,
1998), antifungal (Nguyen and Kim, 2015), and antiparasitic
compounds (Procopio et al., 2012). In 1943, it was streptomycin
(from Streptomyces) that was the great savior against the
formally incurable scourge of tuberculosis (Schatz et al.,
1944).
Another promising avenue of drug (re)discovery lies in the
investigation of traditional medicines or ethnopharmacology.
Although ancient medical traditions are well known in Chinese
and Native American cultures, less is known about European folk
medicines (Foley, 2015; Behroozian et al., 2016; Kung et al., 2018).
One of the last vestiges of continuous ethnopharmacological
culture can be found on the most westerly fringes of Europe,
in rural locations on the island of Ireland (Foley, 2015). One
such cure originates from a region of the West Fermanagh
Scarplands known locally as Boho (pronounced Bo) in Northern
Ireland. This cure is derived from an alkaline soil deposited in
the late Pleistocene period (circa 9,126,000–
11,700 years ago) on
a bedrock of Carboniferous Dartry limestone (circa 335 million
years ago) imparting an alkaline/high radon character to the
soil (Brunton and Mason, 1979). Traditionally, this cure had
been used to treat a variety of conditions from toothache to
infections by placing a small portion of the soil wrapped in
cloth next to the infection or underneath the users’pillow for
9 days. The soil was then returned to the area of sampling.
The exact specificity and origins of the cure are obscured by
lack of documentation, however, some relatively recent written
records remain, associating it with the grave of James McGirr, a
cleric and healer who died in 1815 (Gallachair, 1975). Previous
to this time the area had significance as an amphitheater
for the Druids and a symbolic place for Neolithic peoples as
evidenced by the nearby Reyfad stones (Halpin and Newman,
2009).
The purpose of this paper is to report the isolation of a novel
alkaliphilic strain of Streptomyces from soil with antimicrobial
activity against multiresistant ESKAPE pathogens which may
have potential clinical applications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sampling
The Boho soil sample was collected from an alkaline escarpment
region (Latitude-54.364637◦N Longitude-7.820939◦W) at the
Sacred Heart Church, in the townland of Toneel North, Boho,
Fermanagh, United Kingdom (Donnelly et al., 2003) on the
28 July 2015. The test soil, which was pre-aliquoted into
small cloth bags on site, was sampled with a sterile spatula.
Instructions as to the traditional uses and practices with the soil
are displayed on the door of an adjacent building. Approximately
25 g of this soil sample was collected in a sterile conical
sample tube (50 ml) and dispatched to the laboratory for
analysis. For laboratory analysis, 1 g of the Boho soil sample
was diluted in 1 ml sterile water, vortexed, and cultured on
International Streptomyces Project (ISP) 2 agar (1/5th strength),
and Starch agar (1/5th strength) for the initial Streptomyces
isolation.

Boho’s Novel Streptomyces
Isolates were assigned unique isolate IDs and subsequently
anonymized with designations a, b, c, etc. (meaning the strains
cannot be linked to patients in any identifiable manner)
in accordance with European regulations. Stocks of original
Streptomyces were frozen at −80◦C in 18% glycerol after their
initial isolation.
Microbiological Media
Microbiological media used in these experiments: ISP 2 media
(1/5th strength: meaning 20% of standard ingredients except
agar which was 2%) and Starch media (1/5th strength) for
initial Streptomyces isolation. Soy Flour Mannitol (SFM) for
Streptomyces sub culture and growth. Alkaline SFM for selection
of alkaline tolerant Streptomyces (soy flour 10 g, mannitol 10 g,
agar 20 g, CaCO3 1 g, humic acid 0.002 g, pH adjusted to
8.3 before sterilization). Blood agar was used for the isolation
and cultivation of clinical isolates and Mueller-Hinton agar used
for antimicrobial tests unless organisms specifically required
enriched blood media.
For the determination of Streptomyces alkaline tolerance,
we
used
ISP-2
media
supplemented
with
Streptomyces
minor elements solution [consisting of 0.1% (wt/vol) (each)
of
ZnSO4·7H2O,
FeSO4·7H2O,
MnCl2·4H2O,
and
CaCl2
anhydrous], 1% (wt/vol) glucose, and 0.02% (vol/vol) NaH2PO4–
K2HPO4 buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.8). It was necessary to increase the
concentration of agar to 4% after pH 13.2, and 6% after 13.4,
due to the inability of lower agar concentrations to solidify. The
pH of the agar was adjusted after sterilization (when the agar
had cooled but was still liquid, i.e., 42–
45◦C) by the addition
of appropriate volumes of filter sterilized sodium carbonate
buffer (0.2 M Na2CO3 + 0.2 M NaH2CO3; pH 9.2 → 10.7) and
potassium chloride/sodium hydroxide buffer (0.2 M KCl + 0.2 M
NaOH; pH 11.6 → 13.0). The pH of the agar was checked
immediately after the agar had set.
On the occasions when the robust growth of frozen
stocks of Streptomyces isolates seemed to decline (as was
observed
from
2-year-old
stocks,
even
when
stored
in
glycerol at −80◦C), stocks were revived by cultivation of
the Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1 on ISP 2
agar (1/5th) supplemented with Streptomyces minor elements
solution. In some cases, a mineral solution was made from
alkaline soil by dissolving 1 g soil in 1 g water, vortexed (1-min),
centrifuged (15,616 × g, 10 min) to clear the supernatant
and then added at a concentration of 0.5% (vol/vol) to pre-
solidified agar. In both cases supplements were filter sterilized
(syringe filter, 0.2 µm) prior to their addition to the agar to
prevent precipitation of ferric compounds. Cores of this agar
were used as negative controls in antimicrobial inhibition
assays
involving
Mueller-Hinton
agar.
All
reagents
were
supplied by Oxoid (Basingstoke, Hampshire, United Kingdom)
except agar which was supplied by Melford (Melford, Suffolk,
United Kingdom).
Atomic Force Microscopy
Atomic Force Microscopy (Bruker BioScope Catalyst; Bruker
Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA, United States) was used to
visualize Streptomyces hyphae growing on glass cover slips. The
measurements were conducted in air, using TESPA cantilevers
(Bruker Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA, United States) in
Tapping Mode, with a nominal spring constant of 40 N/m and
a nominal resonant frequency of 300 kHz. Off-line processing
involved first-order plane fitting and flattening using the software
Nan scope Analysis 1.50 (Bruker Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA,
United States).
pH Measurement
Soil pH was measured by dissolving 1 g of soil in 5 ml distilled
water, shaking for 5 min and then waiting 1 h for the soil to
settle (measuring in triplicate using a pH-meter; Mettler-Toledo
Seven Compact, Leicester, United Kingdom). A similar procedure
was used with pH paper, where 1 g of soil was dissolved in 2 ml
distilled water, vortexed for 15 min, and applied in small aliquots
to pH indicator strips (EMD Millipore ColorpHast, Burlington,
MA, United States). The pH strips were accurate to 0.5 pH units.
To test the alkaline tolerance of bacteria, a pH gradient
was established from pH 9.0 to 13.0 in ISP-2 by adding
sterilized buffer as described above. The pH of agar surface
was continuously monitored using flat pH sticks (Macherey-
Nagel GmbH & Co. KG, Düren, Germany) as described (Jones
et al., 2017). The pH strip accuracy was routinely tested against
standard pH calibration solutions.
Gamma-Irradiation of Streptomyces sp.
Myrophorea, Isolate McG1 Spores
Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1 spore concentrations
were estimated by cultivation of dilutions of the spore stock.
A 1 ml spore suspension (estimated to be 1 × 105 spores/ml)
received gamma radiation doses of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 10.0,
15.0, and 20.0 kiloGray (kGy) from a cobalt source (60Co,
8.2645 Gy/s). Spore suspensions were contained in 2 ml plastic
microfuge tubes surrounded by a layer of ice inside a polystyrene
ice container. After irradiation, aliquots of the spore suspensions
were spread (100 µl) on SFM agar and cultivated for 2–
3 weeks.
The growth of one colony (colony-forming units = CFU) was
interpreted to be the survival of one spore.
Antimicrobial Tests
Agar Overlay
A standard agar overlay combined with an antibiotic assay
was used to test the inhibitory potential of Streptomyces sp.
myrophorea, isolate McG1 against ESKAPE pathogens (Nkanga
and Hagedorn, 1978; Lehrer et al., 1991). Briefly, wells were
made in a base layer (15 ml) of Mueller-Hinton agar. Control
wells contained standard amounts of dissolved antibiotics were
allowed to absorb into the agar over a period of 2 h. Once the wells
were dry, an agar core of Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate
McG1 (cultivated for 9 days 20◦C) was placed in an empty well
in addition to a negative control of the original media without
Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1. This base layer was
then overlaid with 15 ml Mueller-Hinton agar (cooled to 43◦C)
that incorporating the test organisms (ESKAPE pathogens with
a minimum 5 × 105 CFU/ml). Bacterial inhibition was indicated

overnight incubation.
Kirby–Bauer
Antibiotic sensitivity tests (antibiograms) for the Streptomyces sp.
myrophorea, isolate McG1 and for ESKAPE pathogens followed
the Kirby–
Bauer protocol (Bauer et al., 1966). The resistance
profiles (antibiograms) of clinical isolates (ESKAPE pathogens)
were determined using standard concentrations of antibiotic
impregnated discs (Oxoid) as proposed by the European
Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests (EUCAST)
(Supplementary Table S1). Breakpoint tables for interpretation
of MICs and zone diameters can be found in Version 8.0, 20181.
Genotypic Characterization of
Streptomyces sp. Myrophorea, Isolate
McG1
Genome Sequencing
Cultures of Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1 were
grown on 1/10th strength LB agar for DNA extraction using
a Qiagen DNA mini kit (Qiagen, MD, United States) with the
inclusion of a lysis step using lysozyme. Genomic DNA was
prepared for sequencing using Qiagen FX and sequenced on an
Illumina MiSeq platform using a 600 cycle V3 reagent kit.
Assembly and Annotation of Genome
Paired-end reads were subjected to quality filtering using the
Trimmomatic tool (4 bp sliding window of Q20) (Bolger et al.,
2014) prior to de novo genome assembly using SPAdes under
default parameters (Bankevich et al., 2012). The genome assembly
was assessed using QUAST (Gurevich et al., 2013) and annotated
using Prokka (Seemann, 2014) and Rapid Annotation using
Subsystem Technology (RAST)2 (Aziz et al., 2008).
Phylogenetic Analysis
In silico DNA–
DNA hybridization was performed using the
Genome–
Genome Distance Calculator (GGDC) v 2.1 (Auch
et al., 2010) using all Streptomyces genomes (868 sequences) as
references. All genomes were downloaded from GenBank3.
Phylogenetic placement of Streptomyces sp. myrophorea,
isolate McG1 was performed using PhyloPhlAn (Segata et al.,
2013). Protein sequences from annotated Streptomyces genomes
were retrieved autonomously from the GenBank FTP site using
the term “
Streptomyces” as a query. Ortholog identification and
alignment was performed in Phylophlan. A maximum-likelihood
phylogeny was reconstructed from the concatenated alignments
in FastTree MP (JTT + CAT) implemented in the Cipres Science
Gateway Server (Miller et al., 2010). The robustness of the
phylogeny was assessed using 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates.
Secondary Metabolite Analysis
Gene clusters known to be involved in secondary metabolite
biosynthesis, self-immunity, or resistance were identified using

3https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/genomes/13511
Antibiotics and Secondary Metabolite Analysis Shell (anti-
SMASH) version 4.0.0 (Medema et al., 2011). The GenBank
sequence file (from Prokka annotation) was submitted to the web
interface selecting all extra features of annotation.
RESULTS
Isolation of Streptomyces From Soil
Aliquots (20 µl) of diluted soil samples were cultivated on
several agars to select for Streptomyces including ISP2 (1/5th) and
alkaline SFM (Figure 1). The original soil was returned to the
sampling site as per local tradition.
Preliminary screening of the Boho soil sample resulted
in the isolation of eight (visually different) Streptomyces-

and

characteristics.
The

isolate
which had the most consistent inhibitory activity toward

bacteria
(initially

was

for

and

(Figure 1).
Streptomyces Characterization
Visually Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1 had
(powdery) light to dark green colonies on SFM agar with
green to very light green/white spores (Figures 1B,C). After
a period of approximately 3–
5 days, colonies emitted a
distinctly “
germaline” odor. Streptomyces sp. myrophorea,
isolate McG1 appeared to be a non-motile, spore forming
bacteria with very slender vegetative and aerial hyphae. Atomic
force microscopy revealed that the bacterial hyphae were
approximately 0.5–
1.0 µm width, with spores in a linear

conformation (17–
20 spores) having a width of approximately
0.5–
1.0 µm (Figures 1D–I).
Alkaline Tolerance of Streptomyces sp.
Myrophorea, Isolate McG1
The Boho soil sample had an average pH of 7.8 (mean ± standard
deviation 0.35, by pH meter). Parallel measurements using pH
strips indicated a wider range of pH from pH 7.8 to pH 8.5 (six
readings at two different time points).
To measure the pH tolerance of Streptomyces sp. myrophorea,
isolate McG1, a pH gradient was prepared as described. The
pH levels of the agar surface were measured after it had set
and every subsequent day after this using flat pH sticks (see
the section “
Materials and Methods”). The results revealed
pronounced Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1 growth
around pH 9.0 to pH 10 after 3–
4 days. Growth was slower
when bacteria were inoculated on agar that was prepared at
pH 11.5 and took 5 days to be visible, however, during this
time the pH of the agar also dropped to pH 10.5 (Figure 2A).
In addition, we observed that Streptomyces sp. myrophorea,
isolate McG1 inoculated at pH 12.2 or 13.0 could survive
several days without prominent growth. As above, we noted
that bacterial biomass became visible once the pH of the
agar decreased to pH 10.5. In contrast S. coelicolor M145
was unable to grow in high alkaline conditions (pH 9 and
above) implying that our new strain of Streptomyces was more
alkaliphilic.
In contrast to the alkaline conditions, Streptomyces sp.
myrophorea, isolate McG1 did not grow well under acidic
conditions, the lowest pH for growth being pH 6.5.
Based on changes in pH during sterilization of media and
between buffered and unbuffered media, we realize that it is very
important to measure the pH of the agar surface throughout the
bacterial growth cycle.

measurements, pH 9.0 (originally pH 9.5), pH 9.5 (originally pH 10.0), pH 10.0

representative of three independent experiments. (B) Effect of γ-irradiation
(60Co) on spore survival of Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1. All
tests performed in triplicate. The variation in spore survival is indicated using
standard error of the mean.
Radio-Tolerance of Streptomyces sp.
Myrophorea, Isolate McG1
The alkaline environment of the Boho area is not the only
characteristic which makes this region a niche habitat. The
(limestone/shale) bedrock also releases radon gas which can be
found at levels as high as 710 bq/m3 (domestic dwelling annual
totals) in Boho and adjacent areas (Daraktchieva et al., 2015).
To test the effects of radiation on the survival of Streptomyces
sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1, we subjected spore solutions
to increasing levels of gamma radiation, i.e., spores were
removed from a chamber after an exposure to absorbed doses of
0.25 → 20 kGy. After irradiation, aliquots (100 µl) of spores were
spread evenly on diluted ISP2 agar in triplicate. The agar plates
were then incubated at 4–
10◦C for 3 weeks before enumeration.
Our measurements indicated that spores of Streptomyces sp.
myrophorea, isolate McG1 were able to tolerate doses of 4 kGy
of gamma irradiation and still remain viable (Figure 2B). In
comparison, another Streptomyces, Streptomyces radiopugnans
resists radiation expose of up to 15 kGy, whereas vegetative cells
such as Deinococcus radiodurans tolerates an exposure of 12 kGy,
E. coli 600 Gy, and human cells 4 Gy (Mao et al., 2007; Daly,
2012).
Antimicrobial Tests
To test antimicrobial potential of Streptomyces sp. myrophorea,
isolate McG1, agar cores from the Streptomyces were embedded
in Mueller-Hinton test agar and overlaid with a suspension
of ESKAPE pathogens. The pathogens were isolated from
different hospitals in Croatia based on clinical antimicrobial
susceptibility data. Controls consisted of ampicillin (Amp-
20 µg), chloramphenicol (Cam-20 µg), ciprofloxacin (Cip-
5 µg), gentamicin (Gen-30 µg), kanamycin (Kan-10 µg),
streptogramin (10 µg), and ampicillin + sulbactam (Amp + Sulf-
10 µg + 10 µg). An agar core from the original ISP2
supplemented agar was used as a negative control.
ESKAPE pathogens were considered susceptible (S) to
antibiotics if the zone of inhibition was greater than 12 mm
diameter; resistant (R), if zone was less than 8 mm radius and
of intermediate status (I) if the zone was between 8 and 12 mm
or there were a few colonies appearing in between the beginning
of the zone and the edge of the antibiotic disc. A single mark
indicates uniformity of result in a triplicate. Tests with variable
results are indicated by the result of each replicate, i.e., S/R/S
indicates the result of 1st/2nd/3rd test (Table 1).
ESKAPE pathogens are known to resist many clinical
antibiotics
including
aminoglycosides,
beta-lactams,
carbapenems and glycopeptides (Founou et al., 2017). Our
data on the incubation of ESKAPE pathogens reveal that
Streptomyces
sp.
myrophorea,
isolate
McG1
was
broadly
inhibitory to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
Specifically Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1 inhibited
carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii [listed as a critical pathogen
in the WHO priority pathogens list), vancomycin-resistant

The inhibitory effects of Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1 were
compared to those of ampicillin (Amp-10 µg), chloramphenicol (Cam-20 µg),
ciprofloxacin (Cip-5 µg), gentamicin (Gen-30 µg), kanamycin (Kan-10 µg),
streptogramin: ampicillin + sulbactam (Amp + Sulf-10 µg + 10 µg)) and a negative
control (an agar core from the original ISP2 supplemented agar) using the agar
overlay method. ESKAPE pathogens were considered susceptible (S) to antibiotics
if the zone of inhibition was greater than 12 mm diameter; resistant (R), if zone was
less than 8 mm radius and of intermediate status (I) if the zone was between 8 and
12 mm or there were a few colonies appearing in between the beginning of the zone
and the edge of the antibiotic disc. A single mark indicates uniformity of result in a
triplicate. Tests with variable results are indicated by a sign for each replicate, i.e.,

DNA–DNA Hybridization
The top 12 matches against Streptomyces genomes and the
intergenomic distances for in silico DNA–
DNA hybridization
(DDH) were calculated using GGDC (Table 3). The calculation
of GGDC Formula 2 is independent of genome length (calculated
by dividing found identities by high-scoring pairs and not by
whole-sequence length). An absence of any DDH values over
the recognized threshold of 70% revealed that our isolate was an
uncharacterized species of Streptomyces.
Alkaline and Radio Tolerance Genes
The ability of bacteria such as Streptomyces sp. myrophorea,
isolate McG1 to tolerate high levels of alkalinity is often attributed
to alkaline shock genes, proton antiporters (like nhaA), and
multidrug resistance factors (like mdt/mdfA) (Krulwich et al.,
2011; Holdsworth and Law, 2013). We identified the presence
of these genes in the annotated genomes of Streptomyces sp.
myrophorea, isolate McG1 and S. coelicolor M145 listing 25 of
these genes in Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1 and
9 genes in the genome of S. coelicolor M145 (Table 4). Only
Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1 possessed alkaline
shock genes, aspartate/ammonium antiporters, and multidrug
transporters of the type mdtH (Table 4). Hence, the Streptomyces
sp. was referred to as strain myrophorea, isolate McG1, from
the Greek myro (fragrance; the isolate emits a strong fragrant
odor) and phorea (porter/carrier; in recognition of the number
of predicted antiporter genes).
A similar identification of the number of DNA repair genes
for Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1, and S. coelicolor
M145 revealed little difference (Supplementary Table S2).
Phylogeny
To infer the evolutionary history of Streptomyces sp. myrophorea,
isolate McG1 a maximum-likelihood phylogeny was performed
using a concatenation of 400 protein sequences (Figure 4).
Identification of Secondary Metabolites
Potential antibiotic synthesis clusters from Streptomyces sp.
myrophorea, isolate McG1 were predicted using anti-SMASH
(Adamek et al., 2017). This revealed that Streptomyces sp.
myrophorea, isolate McG1 possessed a total of 45 secondary
metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters including multiple clusters
with genes encoding the following secondary metabolite families:
non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) – 5 clusters; type I
polyketide synthase (TI PKS) – 10 clusters; type III polyketide
synthase (TIII PKS) – 2 clusters; terpenes – 5 clusters,
lantipeptides –3 clusters, and other biosynthesis genes clusters
(BGCs) (Table 5).
Streptomyces sp. Myrophorea, Isolate
McG1 Resistance to Antibiotics
Antibiotic producing bacteria such as Streptomyces often
require resistance genes to ameliorate the potentially toxic
nature of their secondary metabolites. Such resistance elements
can also be associated with antimicrobial biosynthesis gene
clusters and can be used to predict potential antimicrobial
synthesis
(Nodwell,
2007).
To
better
characterize
these
resistance elements, we cultivated Streptomyces sp. myrophorea,
isolate McG1 in the presence of 36 different antibiotics (in
triplicate). Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1 was
resistant to 20 out of the 36 antibiotics tested after 2 days
growth (Table 6 and Figure 5A). Resistance to a further eight
antibiotics was visually apparent after a further 4 days, most
notably in vancomycin, produced by Amycolatopsis orientalis;

It is also possible that resistance may also be mediated

clusters.
DISCUSSION
We have isolated a novel species of Streptomyces from an
alkaline/radon environment that inhibits the growth of many
multiresistant ESKAPE pathogens. There have been several
reports in recent years of the presence of Streptomyces and
other organisms in alkaline environments that can tolerate
high pH levels (Tiago et al., 2004; Yucel and Yamac, 2010;
Janto et al., 2011; Maciejewska et al., 2016). Our original
hypothesis presumed that the Boho soil sample most likely
contained Streptomyces which may produce antibiotics given
the alkaline nature of the environment (Kontro et al., 2005).
However, we were surprised to find that our isolate, Streptomyces
sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1 inhibited the growth of many
of the multiresistant ESKAPE pathogens. Some of these
bacteria have been listed in a recent WHO document on
priority pathogens urgently requiring the development of new
antibiotics, such as carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (at
the top of this list) classified as a critical priority pathogen
and vancomycin-resistant Enterobacter faecium and methicillin-
resistant S. aureus classified as high priority pathogens (Tacconelli
et al., 2018).
We have not ascertained the active component(s) responsible
for inhibition of ESKAPE pathogens by Streptomyces sp.
myrophorea, isolate McG1 as yet but this forms part of our
ongoing research. Many Streptomyces species have the capacity to
produce multiple antibiotics whose composition and identity can
vary from species to species (Watve et al., 2001; Procopio et al.,
2012). Given that our isolate encodes many antimicrobial gene
clusters, it is entirely possible that some of these are responsible
for the inhibition of ESKAPE pathogens. Given that our species
is also novel and has the capacity to inhibit many multi-resistant
pathogens also raises the possibility that some of its inhibitory
components could be novel.
Another unexpected finding of the research was that although
the pH of the Boho soil sample was around pH 8; our species
of Streptomyces was able to grow at pH 10.5. This suggested not
only tolerance of high alkaline conditions but the capacity to grow
and divide in an extreme environments. More detailed tests will
have to be made to ascertain the specifics of these optimal growth
conditions.
The mechanism by which organisms such as Streptomyces
can ameliorate high alkaline conditions is thought to be a
product of a group of pH homeostasis genes, some of which

have been identified in other species as alkaline shock genes,
multidrug resistance factors (mdt/mdfA) and proton antiporters
(nhaA) (Krulwich et al., 2011; Holdsworth and Law, 2013).
Alkaline tolerance is also linked to the production of antibiotics
through the presence of multidrug resistance factors which are
often associated with antimicrobial biosynthesis gene clusters
(Nodwell, 2007).
In support of our results, genome sequencing of Streptomyces
sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1 revealed that it contained more
annotated alkaline tolerance genes than S. coelicolor M145
(at 25/9). Furthermore alkaline shock genes, ammonium and
aspartate antiporters and multidrug resistance antiporters of
the type mdtH were only identified in the Streptomyces sp.

smell of the Streptomyces that prompted us to refer to the strain
as myrophorea, isolate McG1, myro (Greek for fragrance) and
phorea (Greek for porter).
The sequencing of the Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate
McG1 genome also enabled the prediction of potential antibiotics
through anti-Smash and RAST (Aziz et al., 2008; Medema et al.,
2011). However, given the cryptic nature of many Streptomyces
spp. metabolites, it cannot be assumed these antibiotics are
produced until their products are identified. We were also able
to predict many antibiotic resistance clusters through RAST
which are often associated with antimicrobial biosynthesis gene

clusters (Nodwell, 2007). Antimicrobial resistance predictions
were followed by in vitro experiments on 36 clinical antibiotics.
This data showed that Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate
McG1 was resistant to 28 out of 36 antibiotics. Specifically it
was resistant to nearly all the β-lactams, with the exception
of augmentin to which resistance developed after 6 days. The
same pattern of delayed resistance was seen for glycopeptides,
fluoroquinones (such as ciprofloxacin), and tetracyclines (such as
tigecycline).
It is interesting that the ancient healers of Boho made a
connection between alkaline soils (containing Streptomyces sp.)
and (skin) infections. It has only recently been discovered that
the pH of the specific infection sites can rise from normal skin
pH about pH 5.5 to 8.5 and that bacterial biofilms, which can

(6 days) in the presence of an array of clinical antibiotics starting at the top the
image and moving clockwise: imipenem (IMI 10), ertapenem (ETP 10),
linezolid (LZD 10), quinpristin + dalropristin (SYN 15), erythromycin (E 15) and
meropenem (MEM 10). (B) Delayed development of antibiotic resistance in
Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1 only became apparent for some
antibiotics after 6 days incubation in the case of erythromycin (E-15 µg),

colonize wounds, can also reach similar pH levels (Schneider
et al., 2007; Hostacka et al., 2010; Percival et al., 2014). Perhaps
the indigenous people, who were undoubtedly in close proximity
to the soil, noted (after many years) its curative properties
under specific conditions. However, it is difficult to know the
exact genesis of this cure because the previous occupants of the
Boho site, the Druids, left no surviving records of healing and
their Neolithic counterparts left only undeciphered carvings on
some nearby stones. Anthropologically, the Boho folk tradition
is similar to that of Kisameet Bay clay in Canada, another
indigenous soil cure which was found to have inhibitory activity
against a range of ESKAPE pathogens (Behroozian et al., 2016).
CONCLUSION
We have isolated and genome sequenced a novel alkaline
and
radio-tolerant
species
of
Streptomyces
from
an
ethnopharmacological soil cure; Streptomyces sp. myrophorea,
isolate McG1. This Streptomyces sp. inhibits many multi-
resistant ESKAPE pathogens including carbapenem-resistant
A. baumannii (a critical priority species from the WHO
priority
list
of
antibiotic-resistant
bacteria),
vancomycin-
resistant
E.
faecium,
and
methicillin-resistant
S.
aureus
(listed as high priority by the WHO). Although not a
complete
elucidation
of
the
antibacterial
components
of
the Boho soil; we think that inhibition of such pathogens
by
Streptomyces
sp.
myrophorea,
isolate
McG1
may
explain
some
of
its
reputed
curative
properties.
It
is
hoped
to
further
characterize
some
of
these
inhibitory
components
from
Streptomyces
sp.
myrophorea,
isolate
McG1
and
investigate
the
properties
of
other
species
contained
in
alkaline
soil.
We
hope
this
will
advance
progress in stemming the tide of multi-resistant bacteria.
