 Abstract
The use of potent therapies inhibiting critical oncogenic pathways active in epithelial cancers has 
led to multiple resistance mechanisms including the development of highly aggressive, small cell 
neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNC). SCNC patients have a dismal prognosis due in part to a 
limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving this malignancy and the lack of 
effective treatments. Here we demonstrate that a common set of defined oncogenic drivers 
reproducibly reprograms normal human prostate and lung epithelial cells to small cell prostate 
cancer (SCPC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), respectively. We identify shared active 
transcription factor binding regions in the reprogrammed prostate and lung SCNCs by integrative 
analyses of epigenetic and transcriptional landscapes. These results suggest that neuroendocrine 
cancers arising from distinct epithelial tissues may share common vulnerabilities that could be 
exploited for the development of drugs targeting SCNCs.
Main text
Human cancers originating in different organs share commonalities in cancer phenotypes 
and molecular features (1). Notably, SCNC is recognized by its unique histological features 
and can arise from almost all epithelial organs including the prostate and lung (2, 3). These 
cancers show remarkable lineage plasticity and acquire therapeutic resistance by converting 
from an epithelial to a neuroendocrine cancer phenotype (4–8). Large-scale analyses of 
transcriptome data from a variety of cancer types have provided substantial evidence (9–11) 
to support a phenotypic convergence to SCNC during cancer progression. The underlying 
molecular mechanisms are not fully understood.
To explore whether distinct human epithelial cell types can be transformed to SCNC by 
shared oncogenic drivers, we used a human tissue transformation assay (12). SCPC is a type 
of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), a class of malignancies that includes the 
extremely rare “large cell prostate carcinoma”, whose exact definition is still emerging (14). 
Overexpression of c-Myc or N-Myc in combination with myristoylated Akt1 (myrAkt1, 
partial mimic of PTEN-loss) drives normal human prostate epithelial cells to poorly-
differentiated prostate adenocarcinoma (PrAd) or SCPC, respectively(12, 13). To identify 
additional oncogenic drivers of SCPC, we investigated the functional impact of dominant 
negative p53 (TP53DN), myrAkt1, RB1-shRNA, c-Myc, and Bcl2 on the genesis of SCPC, 
based on their recurrent genetic alterations in prostate cancers including SCPC (5, 7, 15, 16). 
These five genetic factors are hereafter referred to as PARCB. Primary basal epithelial cells 
were isolated from the prostates of eight human donors and were lentivirally transduced with 
the PARCB factors, briefly cultured in an organoid system (Fig. 1A), and transplanted into 
immunodeficient NOD/SCID-IL2R-γc-KO mice (17) where they formed tumors that 
displayed GFP, RFP, and YFP (Green, Red, and Yellow Fluorescence Protein) expression 
from the three lentiviruses (Fig. 1B). PARCB gene expression and the human cellular origin 
of the tumors were confirmed by immunostaining (fig. S1). All PARCB tumors derived from 
basal cells demonstrated histological features of human SCPC including a high nuclear-to-
cytoplasmic (N:C) ratio, frequent mitotic and apoptotic figures, and uniform expression of 
neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) markers (Fig. 1C and 1D).

 We next defined the genetic factors required to initiate SCPC from the PARCB combination 
by leave-one-out analysis. No tumors developed in the absence of either c-Myc or myrAkt1. 
In the absence of Bcl2, the PARC combination still produced tumors with histologic 
characteristics and NED marker expression consistent with SCPC (Fig. 1D and fig. S2A), 
albeit with reduced efficiency (fig. S3). In contrast to Bcl2, RB1-shRNA and TP53DN 
together or individually were indispensable for SCPC development. Tumors arising from 
these conditions (PACB without RB1-shRNA, ARCB without TP53DN, and ACB without 
TP53DN and RB1-shRNA) displayed histological features of poorly-differentiated PrAd. 
PACB and ARCB tumors displayed only focal expression of NED markers (Fig. 1D). Thus, 
loss of RB1 and inactivation of p53 are required to convert an epithelial lineage to a 
neuroendocrine lineage in SCPC development during human prostate epithelial 
transformation.
To further investigate the molecular contributions of the PARCB genetic factors to SCPC, 
we established tumor cell lines from fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) purified 
cells of the ACB, PACB, ARCB, and PARCB tumors (Fig. 2A). Immunoblot analysis 
confirmed the expression of the respective genetic factors in the newly generated cell lines 
(fig. S2B). We then performed two downstream global analyses: mRNA-sequencing (RNA-
seq) and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin-sequencing (ATAC-seq). Currently, 
there is a lack of gene expression datasets specific for SCPC. We utilized the largest RNA-
seq dataset of NEPC and PrAd patient samples (8) in our study. We simplified the 
nomenclature of NEPC as SCPC to prevent confusion when alternating between epithelial 
tissue types.
Our RNA-seq data revealed that the PARCB cell lines have transcriptomes that are distinct 
from those characterizing ACB, PACB, and ARCB lines (fig. S4A), supporting the 
histologic and molecular differences we observed above. The PARCB cell lines exhibited 
enriched expression of genes that are up-regulated in clinical SCPC specimens relative to 
PrAd samples (8, 18) whereas the ACB, PACB, and ARCB lines did not (fig. S5A). The 
PARCB lines were also highly similar to human SCPC (fig. S5B) based on a published 
SCPC gene expression signature (7).
Global transcriptome analysis revealed that the PARCB cell lines exhibited strong 
transcriptional similarity to SCPC patient samples, while the other engineered cell lines 
clustered with patient-derived PrAd cell lines (Fig. 2B). They did not express detectable 
levels of androgen receptor (AR) and exhibited the lowest level of AR signaling activity 
when compared to clinical samples (fig. S6). The PARCB cell lines also exhibited NED 
markers in vivo and in vitro (fig. S7).
Open- or closed-chromatin regions can be indicative of transcriptional regulatory elements 
and serve as predictors of gene transcription activity. We measured genome-wide chromatin 
accessibility and its association with transcriptional programs by ATAC-seq. PARCB and 
patient-derived SCPC lines exhibited distinct chromatin accessibility status compared to 
ACB, PACB, or ARCB lines (Fig. 2C and fig. S4B). Dual inactivation of p53 and Rb in 
PARCB lines induced dramatic changes in chromatin accessibility compared to ACB lines

 (Fig. 2D). However, single inactivation of p53 or Rb alone in PACB or ARCB lines, 
respectively, did not alter chromatin accessibility compared to ACB lines (Fig. 2D).
Hyper-accessible chromatin regions in PARCB compared to ACB were highly enriched for 
genes associated with neuronal differentiation and SCLC, whereas hypo-accessible regions 
in PARCB were enriched for epithelial development- and PrAd-associated genes (Fig. 2E). 
We conclude that concomitant p53 and Rb disruption is required and may synergize to 
promote lineage plasticity during human prostate epithelial transformation by modulating 
transcriptional and epigenetic programs, supporting previous findings from mouse models 
(8, 19).
To further characterize p53 and Rb inactivation-induced changes in chromatin, we 
performed transcription factor (TF) binding-motif enrichment analysis with the differentially 
accessible peaks in PARCB compared to ACB. We found that LHX family TF-motifs 
(LHX1, LHX2, and LHX3) and ISL1 were the most accessible regions in PARCB, whereas 
OCT family TF-motifs (OCT2 and OCT6) and ETS family TF-motifs (EHF and ELF5) were 
less accessible in PARCB relative to ACB lines (Fig. 2F and table S1). Although the 
biological functions of these TFs are unexplored in prostate cancer, we were able to assess 
the transcriptional activity of these TF-motifs altered by concomitant p53 and Rb disruption. 
Our integrated analysis with the matched RNA-seq data revealed that enriched accessibility 
of LHX2, ISL1, OCT2, or EHF-DNA binding motifs was mirrored by the expression of their 
downstream target genes (Fig. 2G).
We next investigated how similar the PARCB lines might be to SCNCs from other organs. 
We performed a gene list enrichment analysis (20) of 938 transcriptionally-profiled cancer 
cell lines using genes up-regulated in the PARCB lines (table S2). This analysis 
demonstrated that the PARCB cell lines were transcriptionally most similar to SCLC cell 
lines and the NCI-H660 SCPC cell line (fig. S8 and table S3). To further evaluate the 
similarity of SCPC and SCLC, we projected gene expression data from human lung cancer 
samples [from (21) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)] to our aforementioned prostate 
cancer clustering plot in Fig. 2B. All clinical SCLC samples tightly clustered with the SCPC 
samples, indicating that prostate and lung SCNCs are both histologically and 
transcriptionally similar (fig. S9).
Given the similarity of the PARCB prostate cancer models to SCPC and SCLC, we next 
asked whether the PARCB factors could initiate SCLC from human lung epithelial cells. In 
similar fashion to the primary human prostate cells, we transformed primary normal human 
bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells with the PARCB lentiviruses (Fig. 3A). Xenografts 
(NHBE-PARCB) expressed GFP, RFP, and YFP (Fig. 3B) and the PARCB factors (fig. 
S10A). NHBE-PARCB tumors showed typical histological features and NED marker 
expression characteristic of clinical SCLC (Fig. 3C). Removing one gene from the PARCB 
combination did not result in tumor growth. Similar to clinical SCLC (22), all of the tumors 
expressed the proliferation marker Ki67 and none expressed the basal/squamous epithelial 
cell markers p63 and cytokeratin 14 (fig. S10B).

 To interrogate the convergent evolutionary pattern of SCNCs, we established five NHBE-
PARCB tumor cell lines for downstream multi-omics analyses. Like the prostate-PARCB 
lines, the NHBE-PARCB lines propagated in suspension, demonstrated tumorigenic 
potential in vivo (Fig. 3D), and exhibited transcriptional similarity to patient-derived SCLC 
cell lines (from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database (23)) (Fig. 3E). Comparative 
genomic hybridization and whole-exome sequencing analyses identified no recurrent genetic 
alterations between prostate- and lung-PARCB models, indicating that the defined five 
genetic factors are likely sufficient to drive human SCNC (fig. S11 and table S4 and S5).
We found that normal prostate basal epithelial cells and NHBE cells displayed distinct 
transcriptomes. In contrast, the prostate-PARCB and NHBE-PARCB cell lines tightly 
clustered together, indicating a shared gene expression profile associated with 
reprogramming by the PARCB factors irrespective of tissue of origin (Fig. 4A). We then 
examined transcriptome data from SCPC and SCLC patient biopsy specimens (7, 21) and 
compared these to their respective adjacent normal tissues from TCGA. These results 
support the finding that SCPC and SCLC are transcriptionally convergent relative to the 
normal epithelial cells from which they originated (Fig. 4B) and demonstrate that a similar 
convergence occurs in patients.
Both transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory networks dictate cell lineage decisions (24, 
25). We investigated the nature of the global chromatin states involved in the convergent 
transformation to SCNC by ATAC-seq. PARCB, SCPC, and SCLC lines exhibited similar 
chromatin accessibility landscapes (Fig. 4C and fig. S12), which paralleled their 
transcriptional resemblance. Notably, the chromatin accessibility profiles of patient-derived 
SCPC and SCLC cell lines clustered with our prostate- and NHBE-PARCB cell lines but not 
with non-neuroendocrine prostate and lung epithelial cells (Fig. 4C). We identified shared 
hyper- and hypo-accessible chromatin regions in the lung and prostate SCNCs compared to 
normal lung and prostate epithelial cells (fig. S13). The SCNC-specific accessible regions 
were enriched for genes important for development and neuronal differentiation (Fig. 4D 
and table S6).
To gain insight into the possible biological roles of TFs that serve as master regulators in 
SCNCs, we performed DNA-binding motif enrichment analysis of the hyper-accessible 
regions. This analysis revealed motifs corresponding to pro-neural TFs (ASCL1, 
NEUROD1, NEUROG2, and OLIG2) and Nkx homeodomain TFs (NKX2.1, NKX2.2, 
NKX2.5, and NKX6.1) (Fig. 4E and table S7). ASCL1 and NEUROD1 are required for 
SCLC survival and initiation (26–28). NEUROD1, NEUROG2, and NKX homedomain TFs 
are implicated in neural stem cell patterning and neural progenitor fate specification (29). 
NKX2.1/TTF-1 is a biomarker for SCLC and SCPC (30). We found that the chromatin 
regions for binding p53 family TFs (p53, p63, and p73) and ETS family TFs (ELF3, ELF5, 
and ERG) were less accessible in SCNCs relative to normal epithelial cells (Fig. 4E). Both 
of these TF families also play critical roles in neuronal development and lineage decisions 
(31, 32). Our motif analysis identified TFs known to be involved in neural proliferation and 
differentiation as well as additional TFs (table S7) with unexplored roles in SCNC. We next 
evaluated both RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data to compare the transcriptional activity of these 
TFs with the global accessibility of their DNA-binding motifs. Our integrated analysis

 revealed that the differentially accessible TF-motifs we identified correlated with the 
transcriptional output of TF target genes for each motif (Fig. 4F and fig. S14). These 
findings indicate that concomitant enrichment of pro-neural TFs and Nkx homeodomain TFs 
and silencing of ETS family TFs and p53 family TFs transcriptional activities are conserved 
in and are likely critical for transformation to SCNC across tissue types.
Current therapeutic strategies designed to inhibit oncogenic pathways driving malignant 
phenotypes almost inevitably lead to treatment-resistant cancers. Increasingly, treatment-
resistant tumors that assume aggressive clinical characteristics and molecular features of 
both stem-like and neuroendocrine lineages are being identified in a variety of epithelial 
cancers. We provide cellular, transcriptional, and epigenetic evidence that the SCNC 
phenotype that arises from distinct epithelial organs represents a common point in the 
evolution of cancers that is induced by shared genetic and epigenetic processes. Although 
normal human epithelial cells derived from developmentally distinct organs have their own 
molecular landscapes, our findings demonstrate that a defined set of oncogenic factors can 
induce the development of a common lethal neuroendocrine cancer lineage (SCNC) from 
different epithelial cell types. We have characterized the essential contribution of these 
factors and the convergence of both the transcriptional and chromatin landscapes during the 
process of transformation to SCNC. Our integrated molecular analyses have identified a 
group of key transcription factors that appear critical for initiation and maintenance of 
SCNC independent of the tissue of origin. These data may help inform efforts to identify 
novel therapeutic approaches for preventing the emergence of SCNCs and for treating them 
once they arise.
