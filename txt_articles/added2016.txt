ABSTRACT 
1 
Study Design: Randomized controlled trial  
2 
Objective: To determine the effectiveness of adding the use of Kinesio Taping in patients 
3 
with chronic nonspecific low back pain who receive physical therapy program consisting 
4 
of exercise and manual therapy.  
5 
Background: Many clinical practice guidelines endorses that both manual therapy and 
6 
exercise are effective treatment options for patients with low back pain. To optimize the 
7 
effects of the treatments recommended by the guidelines, a new intervention known as 
8 
kinesio Taping is being widely used in these patients.  
9 
Methods: 148 patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain were randomly allocated 
10 
to receive ten twice-weekly sessions of physical therapy consisting of exercise and 
11 
manual therapy or the same treatment with the addition of kinesio Taping applied to the 
12 
lower back. The primary outcomes were pain intensity and disability (5 weeks after 
13 
randomization) and the secondary outcomes were pain intensity, disability (3 months and 
14 
6 months after randomization), and satisfaction with care (5 weeks after treatment). Data 
15 
were collected by a blinded assessor.  
16 
Results: No between-group differences in the primary outcomes pain intensity (mean 
17 
difference = -0.01 points; 95% CI -0.88 to 0.85) and disability (mean difference = 1.14 
18 
points, 95% CI -0.84 to 3.13) were observed. In addition, no between-group differences 
19 
were observed for any of the other outcomes evaluated, except disability 6 months after 
20 
randomization (mean difference = 2.01 points, 95% CI 0.03 to 4.00) in favor of the control 
21 
group.  
22 
Conclusion: Patients who received a physical therapy program consisting of exercise and 
23 
manual therapy did not get additional benefit from the use of Kinesio Taping. 
24 
Level of Evidence: Therapy, level 1b.

INTRODUCTION 
30 
Low back pain is a significant public health problem3, 11, 30 and it affects 
31 
approximately 39% of the world’s population at some stage in their lives14, 17. Because of 
32 
this high prevalence, clinical practice guidelines have been developed in order to 
33 
summarize the best evidence for the care of these patients3, 13, 24. Several interventions 
34 
commonly used by physical therapists, such as manual therapy techniques and exercises 
35 
are endorsed in most guidelines as effective treatments for patients with low back pain3, 
36 
13, 24; however, the effect of these techniques is, at best, moderate10, 13, 16. Therefore, new 
37 
interventions have been tested in order to enhance the effects of existing treatments. 
38 
The method that has long been used in patients in rehabilitation clinics to Olympic 
39 
athletes, is Kinesio Taping®. The Kinesio Taping® was introduced at the Olympic Games 
40 
in Athens and has since gained increasing popularity19. One of the main objectives of the 
41 
method, according to its creators, is to reduce pain by inhibiting the nociceptive stimuli 
42 
with elastic tape19, 20. 
43 
The evidence of the benefits that the Kinesio Taping can promote for patients with 
44 
chronic low back pain is still scarce. To date, four randomized controlled trials have been 
45 
published6, 21, 27, 29, two of which did not perform sample size calculation or medium- and 
46 
long-term follow-up6, 27 and three of which only analyzed the isolated effect of this 
47 
technique versus sham taping6, 29 or versus exercise27. Among the published systematic 
48 
reviews4, 18, 22, 23, 28, the most recent28 included 12 studies with quality that ranged from 
49 
low to very low according to the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations 
50 
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) of the Cochrane Collaboration15. The results 
51 
of this review indicate that there is no current evidence to support the use of this method28. 
52 
Low quality in the GRADE means that new studies have the potential to modify the 
53 
results of current evidence15. All systematic reviews published to date indicate the need

for new, low risk of bias, randomized controlled trials with medium to long-term follow-
55 
up4, 22, 23, 28. Most important, no studies have investigated the addition of the use of Kinesio 
56 
Taping to a physical therapy program consisting of exercise and manual therapy.  
57 
Therefore, the objective of this randomized controlled trial was to compare the 
58 
effectiveness of adding Kinesio Taping to a physical therapy program in patients with 
59 
chronic nonspecific low back pain. 
60 
 
61 
METHODS 
62 
Study design 
63 
This is a two-arm, randomized controlled trial with a blinded assessor. This 
64 
clinical trial was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Universidade Cidade de 
65 
São Paulo (protocol 254.063) and prospectively registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov - 
66 
NCT01866332. All methodological details of this trial were published before the start of 
67 
the data collection2. 
68 
 
69 
Participants  
70 
The participants were recruited and treated at the rehabilitation department of 
71 
Irmandade da Santa Casa de Misericórdia de São Paulo, Brazil, from June 2013 to 
72 
November 2014. To be eligible, the patient could be of either gender and had to be aged 
73 
18-60 years, experiencing chronic nonspecific low back pain for more than three months 
74 
and seeking physical therapy treatment. Participants were excluded if they were pregnant 
75 
or had contraindications to physical exercise according to the American College of Sports 
76 
Medicine1, serious spinal pathology, nerve root compromise, contraindication to the use 
77 
of Kinesio Taping due to allergy and intolerance to the tape, or cardiorespiratory disease.

Outcomes and follow up 
80 
Prior to randomization, a blinded assessor collected the data at baseline using an 
81 
evaluation form with questions on clinical and sociodemographic characteristics as well 
82 
as the following outcome measures:  
83 
1) Pain Numerical Rating Scale9, which assesses pain intensity. This is an 11-point 
84 
scale ranges from 0 “no pain” to 10 “the worst possible pain”. The participants were 
85 
instructed to report the level of pain intensity in the last seven days;  
86 
2) Roland Morris disability questionnaire9, 25, which evaluates the patient’s level 
87 
of disability. It assess disability associated with low back pain by means of 24 questions 
88 
that describe daily tasks that the patients have difficulty performing due to low back pain. 
89 
Scores range from 0 to 24 and high scores mean high disability; 
90 
3) Global Perceived Effect Scale9. This scale assesses the global impression of 
91 
recovery of the treatment comparing the onset of symptoms to the last few days. It is an 
92 
11-point numerical scale ranging from -5 (absolutely worse0 to 0 (no changes) to +5 
93 
(completely recovered);   
94 
4) MedRisk instrument for measuring Patient Satisfaction with physiotherapy care 
95 
(MRSP)5, 12. This 13-item questionnaire assesses satisfaction with physical therapy care. 
96 
Each item varies from 1 “strongly disagree” to 5 “absolutely agree” and the higher the 
97 
score is, the greater the patient’s satisfaction. This instrument is divided into 3 
98 
dimensions: 1) interpersonal, including 6 items related to the patient’s interaction with 
99 
therapists and employees; 2) convenience and efficiency, containing 3 items related to 
100 
time of appointment and courtesy; 3) patient education, containing 2 items related to the 
101 
therapist’s dedication and 2 global items. The score varies from 0 to 5 points, with higher 
102 
scores representing high satisfaction with care.

6 
 All scales and questionnaires have been translated and cross-culturally adapted to 
104 
the Brazilian population and their respective measurement properties have been assessed9, 
105 
12, 25. These measures are recommended by an expert committee on low back pain as 
106 
essential instruments for all clinical trials that include patients with low back pain7. 
107 
The primary outcome measures were pain intensity and disability measured at 5 
108 
weeks after randomization (immediately after treatment). The secondary outcome 
109 
measures were pain intensity and disability at 3 and 6 months after randomization and 
110 
global perceived effect at 5 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after randomization. Another 
111 
secondary outcome evaluated was satisfaction with care at 5 weeks after randomization. 
112 
All baseline assessments were conducted in person, but the vast majority of data collected 
113 
during the follow up assessments were collected over the phone  
114 
All patients deemed eligible for the study were tested for allergic reaction to the 
115 
Kinesio Tape prior to randomization. The test consisted of applying a small piece of 
116 
Kinesio tape to the thoracic spine of patients and leaving it for 24 hours. If the participants 
117 
developed allergies or intolerance to the tape, they were excluded from the study. If they 
118 
did not, they were allocated to one of the treatment groups. 
119 
 
120 
Randomization and Interventions 
121 
Immediately after the allergy test, the therapist completed a checklist to determine 
122 
whether the eligibility criteria of patients were correct and then opened the randomization 
123 
envelope prior to starting the first session of treatment. The randomization sequence was 
124 
created using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) and sealed in 
125 
sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes by a researcher who was not involved in the 
126 
assessment or treatment of patients. Once the envelope was opened, the patient was

7 
allocated to one of two groups: physical therapy group or physical therapy plus Kinesio 
128 
Taping group. 
129 
Both groups received physical therapy treatment consisting of exercise and 
130 
manual therapy. The therapists could apply the manual therapy techniques that were 
131 
appropriate to the patient (including joint mobilization and myofascial release), as well 
132 
as general exercise (e.g. aerobic exercise and strengthening of the large muscle groups 
133 
such as rectus abdominis and gluteus maximus) and specific exercises to strengthen the 
134 
lumbar spine (e.g. strengthening of transversus abdominis and lumbar multifidus). The 
135 
decision to use one or more resources was pragmatic, i.e. the therapist would decide what 
136 
procedures to use at each session based on their clinical reasoning. 
137 
These techniques were applied according to the clinical presentation of each 
138 
patient, as routinely assessed by the therapist. The objectives of the interventions were 
139 
reducing pain intensity, muscle strengthening, improving motor control, and promoting 
140 
the independence of the participant.  
141 
The group that received physical therapy plus Kinesio Taping had the elastic tape 
142 
applied to the lower back at the end of the sessions. Prior to application, the area was 
143 
shaved (if necessary) and cleansed to improve adherence. The Kinesio Tape was 
144 
positioned bilaterally on the erector spinal muscles parallel to the spinous processes of 
145 
the lumbar vertebrae (Figure 1).  
146 
 
147 
FIGURE 1 
148 
 
149 
After that, the participant was instructed to leave it on for 48 hours and return to 
150 
normal activities such as bathing, doing household chores, working, etc. If the participant 
151 
developed any kind of skin reaction, he/she was instructed to remove the tape.

The sessions were 30-60 minutes long, twice a week for 5 weeks. All participants 
153 
were instructed to do the muscle strengthening exercises at home, once a day (3 sets of 
154 
10 repetitions for each exercise); however, these home exercises were not monitored. A 
155 
total of three physical therapists with an average of 6 years of clinical experience 
156 
participated on this trial. All of them were trained in manual therapy (Maitland’s 
157 
approach). The corresponding author is certified by the Kinesio Taping Association 
158 
International (levels KT1 and KT2) and provided training to the therapists on how to 
159 
apply the Kinesio Taping. All therapists were formally trained for a period of one week 
160 
in order to standardize the approach. All senior authors (LOPC, LCM, DGF and TYF) 
161 
audited the interventions over the trial period.  
162 
 
163 
Blinding 
164 
In this study, the assessor was blinded to the allocation of participants in their 
165 
respective groups; however, given the nature of the interventions, it was not possible to 
166 
blind both the therapists and the patients. 
167 
 
168 
Sample calculation 
169 
The sample size calculation was based on the detection of a one-point difference 
170 
between groups for the outcome pain intensity assessed by the Pain Numerical Rating 
171 
Scale (estimated SD of 1.84) and a four-point difference for the outcome disability 
172 
measured by the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (estimated SD of 4.9)10 with a 
173 
statistical power of 80%, alpha of 5%, and possible sample loss of up to 15%. Therefore, 
174 
74 participants were needed per group or 148 in total.

All statistical procedures were performed according to the principles of intention 
178 
to treat. First, we conducted descriptive analyses and histogram inspections to determine 
179 
data normality (or lack thereof). The between-group comparisons to obtain the mean 
180 
effects were conducted by means of interaction terms (group versus time interactions) 
181 
using Linear Mixed Models. The statistical analysis was conducted by a researcher who 
182 
was not involved in any of the phases of data collection and received data in coded form. 
183 
The differences were considered statistically significant when p<0.05. The software 
184 
package SPSS 19 was used for these analyzes. 
185 
 
186 
RESULTS 
187 
A total of 198 potential participants sought the treatment for back pain over the 
188 
course of the study. Of this total, 50 were considered ineligible (Figure 2). The reasons 
189 
for exclusion were: back pain due to nerve root compromise (n=17), decompensated 
190 
heart disease (n=6), withdrawal prior to the start of the study (n=5), age above 60 (n=3), 
191 
vertebral fracture (n=3), previous surgery to the lumbar spine (n=2), knee surgery 
192 
scheduled for the study period (n=2), no telephone number for follow-up (n=2), lower 
193 
limb tumor (n=1), acute low back pain (n=1), contraindications to the use of Kinesio 
194 
Taping (n=1), pain in the thoracic spine (n=1), scheduled bone marrow transplant during 
195 
the treatment period (n=1), multiple myeloma in the spine (n=1), chemotherapy (n=1), 
196 
anxiety (n=1), already receiving physical therapy treatment (n=1), and hepatomegaly 
197 
(n=1).

Regarding the number of sessions, of the 1480 predicted sessions (n=148 x 10 
200 
sessions) only 47 absences were recorded (3.17%). On average, each patient attended 
201 
9.70 sessions (SD=1.00) for the physical therapy group and 9.66 sessions (SD=1.17) for

the physical therapy plus Kinesio Taping group, which represents an excellent 
203 
adherence to treatment. The groups not differ in their adherence (p=0.82). In five cases 
204 
(6.7%), some type of skin irritation occurred due to the application of the Kinesio Tape; 
205 
however, this irritation subsided before the following session and did not prevent the 
206 
participants from completing the study. One participant from the physical therapy group 
207 
was mistakenly treated with Kinesio Tape from the fifth session, but was analyzed in 
208 
his original group following the recommendations of intention to treat analysis. 
209 
During the 3-month reassessment, a participant of the physical therapy plus 
210 
Kinesio Taping group declined to answer the questionnaires due to high pain intensity 
211 
and because he wanted to receive more sessions than the protocol allowed. There were 
212 
only three losses to follow-up, which reflects an excellent follow up rate (Figure 2). 
213 
Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the participants in their 
214 
respective groups. The study included mainly single women with completed primary 
215 
education. The groups have similar baseline characteristics. 
216 
TABLE 1 
217 
Table 2 shows the mean (SD) of pain intensity, disability and global perceived 
218 
effect in all time points. The results indicate that symptoms improved with the 
219 
interventions and this improvement was maintained over time. Table 3 shows the within 
220 
and between-group differences for all outcomes. In the within-group analysis, the 
221 
treatments reduced pain and disability and increased the participant’s perceived 
222 
improvement (about 35% improvement, which can be considered as clinically 
223 
important)26. In the between-group analysis, however, no differences were observed, 
224 
except for disability at 6 months in favor of the physical therapy group.

Another outcome evaluated was the satisfaction with care after five weeks of 
226 
treatment. Overall, there was a high degree of satisfaction with care in both groups, with 
227 
no between-group statistically significant differences.  
228 
TABLE 3 
229 
DISCUSSION 
230 
This randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the effectiveness of adding 
231 
Kinesio Taping to a physical therapy program consisting of exercise and manual therapy 
232 
in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain compared to patients who received 
233 
only physical therapy. After five weeks of treatment, the between-group comparisons 
234 
showed no advantage of using Kinesio Taping in these patients for all primary outcomes. 
235 
These estimates were maintained over time for all other secondary outcomes, except for 
236 
disability at 6 months in favor of the control group. Clearly, the addition of Kinesio 
237 
Taping to physical therapy did not enhance treatment outcomes at any point in time. 
238 
Another outcome measured was the level of satisfaction with care, which was very high 
239 
in both groups. Similarly, there were no between-group differences in satisfaction levels. 
240 
Currently, there is one meta-analysis related to prevention and treatment of sports 
241 
injuries31, and there are five systematic reviews, including two18, 22 with different clinical 
242 
conditions and three4, 23, 28 that assess musculoskeletal conditions of the effects of Kinesio 
243 
Taping. None of the studies cited above provide favorable results for the use of this 
244 
method. The randomized controlled trials that evaluated the musculoskeletal conditions 
245 
published to date have moderate methodological quality22, 23, 28 and, for the most part, 
246 
have small samples (i.e. 42 patients per trial)28, 31. Furthermore, the quality of the evidence 
247 
against the use of Kinesio Taping28 varies from low to very low. This reinforces the 
248 
importance of our study, not only for the scientific community, but also for clinicians, 
249 
because it aims to minimize the risk of bias and use an appropriate sample of patients in

order to better understand the effects of adding Kinesio Taping to the treatment of patients 
251 
with chronic low back pain. Another strength of this study is its pragmatic nature 
252 
regarding the use of exercise and manual therapy. We believe that our results are 
253 
generalizable to physical therapists who usually use these interventions. 
254 
Our data corroborate the results of three previous randomized controlled trials that 
255 
do not support the application of Kinesio Taping in patients with chronic nonspecific low 
256 
back pain. The study by Paoloni27 aimed to evaluate pain intensity and disability of 39 
257 
patients with chronic low back pain after 4 weeks of treatment. The patients were 
258 
allocated into three different groups: Kinesio Taping alone; muscle strengthening and 
259 
relaxation techniques; and a combination of the two interventions. As in the present study, 
260 
the analysis of the results showed no statistically significant difference between groups. 
261 
Castro-Sanchez et al.6 analyzed pain and disability, as well as muscular endurance and 
262 
kinesiophobia, in 60 individuals allocated into two groups (Kinesio Taping vs. sham 
263 
taping) and found no difference in any of the outcomes measured between groups after 
264 
four weeks of intervention. Finally, the study by Parreira et al.13 evaluated the effects of 
265 
skin convolutions generated by Kinesio Taping, compared to no convolutions, in 148 
266 
patients and found no difference between the two forms of application. 
267 
One of the differences between the existing clinical trials is in relation to patient 
268 
follow-up periods. Paoloni et al.27 and Castro-Sanchez et al.6 included a short-term 
269 
follow-up period, while the present study conducted follow-ups for up to six months from 
270 
randomization. The three clinical trials published to date6, 27, 29 evaluated the effect of 
271 
Kinesio Taping with different objectives: isolated, combined with global strengthening 
272 
exercises, and the form of application. Our study aimed to replicate clinical practice and 
273 
add other interventions to the treatment of the participants, therefore we used resources 
274 
described in the clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of patients with chronic

13 
nonspecific low back pain in order to determine whether the addition of Kinesio Taping 
276 
would enhance the effects of treatments already supported by the literature. Our results 
277 
show that there is not an additive effect between Kinesio Taping and physical therapy 
278 
consisting of manual therapy and exercise. 
279 
 
280 
Study limitations 
281 
This study followed all steps described in the published protocol2, with no 
282 
deviations from the trial protocol. The study design aimed to minimize most sources of 
283 
risk of bias. However it was not possible to blind both the therapist and participants, which 
284 
can be considered a limitation of our study.  
285 
Another limitation of our study is related to the replicability of the interventions 
286 
provided. Although pragmatic and individualized approaches are important, we 
287 
acknowledge that this approach is difficult to be replicated. Finally, although subgroup 
288 
analysis is considered as the top research priority8 in the back pain field, our study was 
289 
not adequately powered for such analysis. It is possible that some patients would benefit 
290 
more from Kinesio Taping than others, but we are unaware of studies (even preliminary 
291 
derivation studies) aimed on this research question.  
292 
CONCLUSION  
293 
The literature suggests that the use of Kinesio Taping in isolation provides no 
294 
benefit to patients with chronic low back pain21, 29. Similarly, its use as an additional 
295 
method in a treatment based upon exercise and manual therapy does not alter the 
296 
outcomes, as shown by the results of our study.

Findings: This study did not identified an additional benefit of using Kinesio Taping in 
299 
patients with back pain who received physical therapy consisting of exercises and manual 
300 
therapy.  
301 
Implications: Patients would not get additional benefit from the use of Kinesio Taping 
302 
if they receive a treatment based on individualized exercises and manual therapy.  
303 
Cautions: As our approach was pragmatic and individualized, it is possible that our 
304 
approach could not be fully replicated.
