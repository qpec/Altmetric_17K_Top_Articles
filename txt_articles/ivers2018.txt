 Lessons From the Canadian Experience
With Single-Payer Health Insurance
Just Comfortable Enough With the Status Quo

n the fall of 2017, US Sen Bernie Sanders (Independent,
Vermont) visited Toronto to learn about health care in
Canada. His warm welcome by large crowds prompted the
question: Why is Bernie Sanders so popular in Canada? Perhaps
by advocating universal single-payer health insurance in
the United States, Sanders gives voice to a core aspect of
national identity for many Canadians. He reaffirms their belief
that provision of health care should be equitable—delivered
according to need rather than wealth. Critics, however, felt
that Sanders missed the challenges in the Canadian system.1
Although proud of its ideals and appreciative of its achievements
in certain areas, many Canadians, including some of the greatest
current champions of Medicare, the unofficial name for the
system, strongly advocate for change.2 Complaints about wait
times are increasingly expressed and disseminated via social
media,3 and there are frequent calls to address ongoing inequity,
particularly in coverage for outpatient medications.4 With single-
payer public health insurance again on the political radar in
the United States at both the state (California) and federal (Demo-
crat party) levels, the performance of the Canadian health care
system during the last 50 years and the lessons it may offer should
be considered.
Performance of the Canadian System Over Time
From its inception in the late 1960s5 to the early 1990s, Canada’

single-payer public health insurance was popular both inside the
countryandabroad.SurveysshowedthatCanadianspreferredtheir

With single-payer public health insurance again on the political radar in the United States at
both the state (California) and federal (Democrat party) levels, the performance of the
Canadian health care system during the last 50 years and the lessons it may offer should be
considered. Canadians are proud of their universal approach to health insurance based on
need rather than income. The system has many strengths, such as the ease of obtaining care,
relatively low costs, and low administrative costs, with effectiveness and safety roughly on
par with other countries, including those, such as the United States, that spend considerably
more per capita. There are increasing frustrations, however, with system performance,
especially with issues related to access and coordination of care. Medicine has changed
dramatically since the introduction of Canadian Medicare in the late 1960s, which primarily
covered acute care physician and hospital services—the needs of the time. Meaningful
reforms that match coverage and services to changing needs, especially those of
community-based patients with multiple chronic conditions, have been difficult to
implement. The status quo represents a compromise struck decades ago between payers and
physicians and organizations that provide health care, and the current system works just well
enough for those who both need it and vote. Enacting substantial change simply carries too
much risk. Perhaps the most important lesson that the United States can learn from Canada’
s
experience during the last 50 years is that a single-payer health care system solves a lot of
problems, but it does not equate to an integrated, well-managed system that can readily
meet the changing health care needs of a population.

dianpolicyanalystsinacademiaandthenewsmediahaveusedthese

als for fundamental changes.
The Canadian health care system has many desirable features.
First,virtuallyeveryonewhohaslegalstatusinCanadacaneasilyac-
quire a card indicating to physicians and hospitals that payment for
care is covered. The process involves neither complex enrollment
procedures nor extensive paperwork. Second, the public program
has low administrative costs (Table). Hospitals collect the majority
of their funds from provincial governments with relatively low re-
porting cost, and physicians are paid promptly and fully, with low
collection costs and almost no preapproval, adjudication, or other
barriersthatpatientsandphysiciansoftenfaceintheUnitedStates.
Thecoverageisalsoportable,althoughnotidentical,acrosstheen-
tire country. Third, patients have the freedom to choose any physi-
cian or hospital,11 face virtually no copayment for medically neces-
saryphysicianandhospitalservices,anddonotreceiveanycomplex
bills to review after discharge. As a result, patients are less likely to
forgo assessment or treatment for financial reasons and much less
likely to end up bankrupt from receiving care. Fourth, effective-
ness and safety are roughly on par with other countries, including
those that spend considerably more per capita. In areas in which
Canada has focused efforts, such as in cancer care, it has achieved
5-yearsurvivalratesamongthehighestintheworld.12Fifth,thevast
majority of Canadians have access to a primary care clinician, and
an increasing number of Canadians achieve continuity of care with
thisclinician.13Strongprimarycareisessentialforanefficienthealth
system and has been posited to partially explain some of the differ-
ences in outcomes, including life expectancy and cost of care, ob-
servedbetweencountries.14Finally,someglobalcomparisonsshow
that Canada is still in the top tier among health systems. For ex-
ample, a 2015 study of 195 countries using the Healthcare Access
andQualityIndexbasedonmortalityfromcausesamenabletoper-
sonal health care (ie, mortality that could be prevented by health
care) ranked Canada 17th, whereas the United Kingdom was 30th
and the United States was 35th (Andorra, Iceland, and Switzerland
werethetop-rankedcountries).15Canadaachievestheseresultswith
less government health spending as a percentage of the gross do-
mestic product (7.4%) than the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development mean (8.3%).7
Nevertheless, there are cracks in the Canadian health care edi-
fice. The drop in popularity among Canadians likely began with
changesmadeinresponsetotheeconomicrecessionofthe1990s,
whencutstohospitalbudgetsandregionalizationofhospitalboards
led to unpopular hospital closures. In addition, capping physicians’
incomes(whichledsomephysicianstomigratetotheUnitedStates)
and reducing medical school class sizes (to address a government-
perceived physician oversupply) led to reduced access and in-
creased wait times. The news media broadly covered these devel-
opments. These changes were aimed largely at reducing or
controlling costs rather than improving quality or outcomes. Since
2000,however,therehavebeenmassiveinvestmentsintothesys-
tem.

most universal praise in Canada for the health system, are an un-
likelyexplanationofcontinuingproblems.Abetterexplanationisthe

 Single Payer, but Not a “System”
As a result of stunted or ineffective policy reforms, the organiza-
tion of Canada’
s health care seems to be frozen in time. That time is
the 1970s, when the country celebrated its ability to make health
insurance available to all Canadians while controlling costs and
achieving physician support. Other countries looked to Canada as
aforward-thinkingexampleofhealthcarereform,withsomecoun-
tries, such as Taiwan, modeling their health insurance on the Cana-
dian approach. In the 1970s, health care expenditures that re-
quired insurance primarily consisted of acute care services paid to
physicians and hospitals. Thus, it is not surprising that the Medical
Care Act of 1966 specifically limited all medically necessary ser-
vices to these items.5 But since the 1970s, health care has changed
dramatically, with an increased number of patients with multiple
chronic diseases who take many medications. Modern health sys-
tems recognize that high-quality chronic disease management re-
quires coordination and continuity to support patients in the com-
munity. Payment methods such as global budgeting for hospitals17
and fee-for-service payment for physicians that were successful in
achievingthegoalsofinsuringacutecareinthe1970shavebeendif-
ficulttochange—andmayactuallyinhibitchange—eventhoughthey

tervailingforcesoffee-for-servicepaymentsprovidingincentivesfor
physicians to expand care and of hospital global budgets providing
incentives for hospitals to provide less care may play a key role in
sustainingthestatusquo.Fundamentally,medicinehaschanged,but
the structure of Canadian Medicare has not.

the news media raises attention, such as delays for emergency de-

targeted initiatives that usually are not replicated in regions be-
yond where they were initially rolled out.20 In addition, there is no
system-wide electronic health record to enable informational con-
tinuity of care as patients with chronic conditions move across care
settings (eg, acute, chronic, and home care), although some prov-
inces, for example, Alberta, have made progress in this regard.
Canada remains the only country we are aware of with univer-
salhealthinsurancebutwithoutbroadpublicinsurancecoveragefor
outpatient medications. (Medicare in Canada covers mainly phar-
maceuticals for inpatients and for outpatients who are older than
65yearsoronsocialassistancebutnotformostworking-ageadults

tion, it is estimated that in 2016, 14.1% of Canadians had no phar-
maceutical coverage through either public or private sources, and
8%ofthosewhoreceivedaprescriptionreportedcost-relatednon-
adherence due to large copays.21
In short, Canada’
s health care system is undermanaged. In-
deed,somearguethatinCanadathereisnota“
system”tomanage.22
Instead, there are a series of independently operating institutions
andprofessionals,representingpredominantly“
private”deliveryof
care, regulated and paid by a single government insurer. Hospitals
are not owned by government, and physicians are not government
employees. This situation contrasts sharply with examples in the
United States of integrated systems, such as Kaiser Permanente or
the US Department of Veterans Affairs, which are able to more ac-
tively manage the delivery of care albeit with variable results. De-
spite their role as single payers, provincial governments in Canada
have been unable to address dysfunctions such as long wait times
and poor coordination where they occur because of the absence of
contracts with physicians, hospitals, and other health care agen-
cies that include shared accountability or even clarity on shared
goals.16 Although the experience with the UK National Health Ser-
vicehasshownthatanintegratedsingle-payersystemdoesnotguar-
antee success in reforms, it does provide a platform for trying. The
contribution of most reform efforts to effectiveness, equity, or ef-
ficiencyinCanada—outsideoflurchestowardvariousmodelsforre-
gionalization or hospital funding—has left many disappointed. The
lack of ambitious attempts at innovation contrasts sharply with the
manylarge-scalereformeffortsintheUnitedStates,althoughthere
is variable evidence about whether these efforts have decreased
costs or increased access and quality of care.
Ontario’
s Experience With Primary Care Reform
One of the most ambitious reforms in Canadian health care in-
volvedchangestoprimarycarebetween2002and2015inOntario,23
themostpopulousprovinceinthecountry,withabout14millionciti-
zens. That case study demonstrates the challenges of implement-
ing reforms that limit the potential advantages of Canada’
s single-
payer system. Since 1968, the predominant payment model for
physicians throughout Canada has been fee-for-service, with fees
determinedbyperiodicnegotiationsbetweenprovincialmedicalas-
sociations and provincial governments. This approach encourages
maximal access and is helpful in scenarios in which the number of
physicians per capita is not particularly high by encouraging physi-
cians to deliver more care. The approach, however, involves no ac-
countabilityexceptforthevolumeofpatientsseen,whichforsome
settings, such as tertiary academic health science centers, aligns
physician behavior with institutional objectives.24 In Canada,
primary care is delivered predominantly by family physicians;
fee-for-service payment encouraged episodic interactions rather
than a comprehensive, longitudinal, and population-oriented
approach.25Fee-for-servicepaymentnegotiationswithinthemedi-

 proceduralandcognitivespecialties,ashasalsobeenthecaseinthe
UnitedStates.Asaresult,primarycarephysiciansincreasinglymade
less money than their peers, particularly those in procedural spe-
cialties. A decreasing number of medical graduates were selecting
family medicine as their specialty of choice.
Beginning in 2002, the Ontario government addressed these
problems through payment changes for primary care. Opportuni-
ties were created for physicians to form groups that could be paid
on a capitation basis instead of fee-for-service in exchange for of-
feringtheirpatientsreliableaccesstoafter-hourscare.26Thepolicy
goal,whichwassupportedbythemedicalassociations(akeyingre-
dient for implementation), was to encourage the development of
patient-centeredmedicalhomes.27Althoughacceptingthenewpay-
ment models was voluntary, many primary care physicians found it
desirable to be paid substantially more without substantially in-
creasing their workload. The reforms successfully addressed some
disparities in primary care physician income compared with the in-
comefromotherspecialtiesandmayhavehelpedincreasemedical
student interest in primary care.13 Patients in the new primary care
models were more likely to receive all appropriate tests for diabe-
tesandweremorelikelytoundergoappropriatescreeningtestsfor
cervical, breast, and colorectal cancers.28
The well-intentioned and substantial investments to facilitate

likely to take advantage of the payment reforms,28,29 and physi-
cians whose patients were more complex chose to continue to be
paid through fee-for-service.29 The government found itself pay-
ing family physicians more overall without achieving commensu-
rate gains in access or equity. In retrospect, the results were
unsurprising.13Astheunintendedconsequencesbecameclear,the
Ontario government began to question the wisdom of further in-
vestment. In 2015, it limited access to the new payment models,30
tothedisappointmentofsubsequentgraduatesoffamilymedicine
training programs.
Why, in a single-payer system with relatively simple account-
ability structures, did the desired changes not follow from well-
intentioned payment reforms? The political compromises required
to push forward these reforms in many respects compromised the
reforms themselves. Neither the medical association (beholden to
the variable perspectives of their broad membership that pretty
muchmandatedvoluntaryparticipation)northeprovincialgovern-
ment (restricted by public opinion and votes) were willing to pur-
sue an overall switch to team-based primary care.
The Enemy of Good
Great is the enemy of good, and good is entirely electable. Given the
remarkablepoliticalachievementofauniversalsingle-payerhealthin-
surancesystemmorethan50yearsago,whyhasmeaningfulreform
eluded Canada ever since? First, Canadians know that the big-ticket

dominatedbycomparisonswithitsclosestneighbor,theUnitedStates,
rather than comparisons to other Organisation for Economic Co-

services in all insurance plans or debate how to segregate high-risk
peopleintoseparatepoolsthatmayormaynotreceiveadequatepub-
licsubsidies(neitherofthesedebatesmakesanysensetomostCana-
dians), enhances Canadians’comfort with their status quo. Fourth,
Canadaisdoingjustwellenough,andmostCanadianswhoexperience

parators has a large effect on how countries are ranked. Although
Canadaisnotperformingaswellinsomeareasofhealthcareasitsciti-
zensdesire,suchaswaittimesandcoordination,citizensofallcoun-
tries are likely similarly disappointed, albeit in different ways.
Finally,thepoliticalnatureofhealthcareinCanadaimposesim-
portant constraints.31 The Constitution Act of 1867 placed respon-
sibility for health care primarily in the hands of the provinces, not
thefederalgovernment.Thus,Canadadoesnothaveasinglehealth
system; each province administers its own health system. This fea-
turelimitsthefederalgovernment’
sabilitytoimposenationalstan-
dards to address provincial inequities, such as establishing a fed-

losethecontrolthattheycurrentlyhave.Thisfeaturealsolimitsthe
abilitytotakeadvantageofeconomiesofscale,suchasthroughne-
gotiationofdrugpricesfortheentirecountry.Inaddition,healthcare
accounts for more than 40% of provincial spending; thus, any
changes that jeopardize cost control mechanisms (such as global
budgetingforhospitals)putgovernmentsatsignificantfinancial(and
therefore electoral) risk.
TheparliamentarysystemofgovernmentinCanada—wherethe
executive and legislative branches are always from the same party
and party discipline enforces leaders’agendas—makes it very clear
to the public who will be responsible if health care fails.32 This po-

(85% of nurses are unionized in Canada33; physicians belong to as-
sociations that bargain on their behalf) to openly oppose the re-
election of political leaders, and every major restructuring or rede-

Rather than waiting for fundamental policy reform, a more re-
