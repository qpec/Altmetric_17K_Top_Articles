Abstract
Recapitulation of lung development from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in three 
dimensions (3D) would allow deeper insight into human development, as well as the development 
of innovative strategies for disease modeling, drug discovery and regenerative medicine1. We 
report here the generation from hPSCs of lung bud organoids (LBOs) that contain mesoderm and 
pulmonary endoderm and develop into branching airway and early alveolar structures after 
xenotransplantation and in Matrigel 3D culture. Expression analysis and structural features 
indicated that the branching structures reached the second trimester of human gestation. Infection 
in vitro with respiratory syncytial virus, which causes small airway obstruction and bronchiolitis in 
infants2, led to swelling, detachment and shedding of infected cells into the organoid lumens, 
similar to what has been observed in human lungs3. Introduction of mutation in HPS1, which 
causes an early-onset form of intractable pulmonary fibrosis4,5, led to accumulation of 
extracellular matrix and mesenchymal cells, suggesting the potential use of this model to 
recapitulate fibrotic lung disease in vitro. LBOs therefore recapitulate lung development and may 
provide a useful tool to model lung disease.
The respiratory system originates from buds that arise on the ventral aspect of the anterior 
foregut endoderm (AFE) and develop through a stereotyped branching process into proximal 
airways and distal alveolar progenitors (pseudoglandular stage). During the canalicular 
stage, cell cycle activity decreases, and specialization of the airway epithelium occurs in the 
stalks, with the emergence of basal, goblet, club, ciliated, and other cell types. This stage is 
followed by the saccular stage, where the canaliculi widen into distal sacculations that will 
give rise to primitive alveoli6,7. Organoids are in vitro generated 3D structures containing 
multiple cell types that are organized similar to an organ and recapitulate some specific 
organ function1. One group reported generation of human lung organoids8,9. However, while 
these small structures contained cells expressing markers of lung and airway8 and have some 
airway potential after subcutaneous xenografting in mice9, they do not satisfy the 
aforementioned criteria for organoids, as neither features of lung development, notably 
branching morphogenesis and proximodistal specification, nor function were observed.
We previously reported a strategy to differentiate hPSCs (embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and 
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)) in 2D through sequential developmental steps from 
definitive endoderm (DE) to AFE, lung field progenitors, and, finally, lung and airway 
epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig. 1a)10–12. Early during induction of a ventral lung fate 
from AFE adherent structures formed that detached easily and expanded in suspension 
culture as clumps of cells (Fig. 1a,b) in the presence of BMP4, FGF10, FGF7, retinoic acid 
(RA) and the GSK3β antagonist, CHIR99201 (Supplementary Fig. 1b), factors shown 
previously to be required for lung development6,7. 7.5×105 DE cells yielded 2490±129 
clumps (n=3; RUES2 ESCs). The structures formed folding sheets of EPCAM
+KRT8+ECAD+FOXA1/2+ AFE cells (FOXA2: 89.07% ± 3.36%, EPCAM+: 92.08% 
± 1.88%, n=3; RUES2 ESCs) (Fig. 1c). By d25 51.26±4.37% (n=3; RUES2 ESCs) of the 
cells expressed the lung marker NKX2.1+ (Fig. 1c). Except for the epithelial progenitor

 marker, p63 (18.59% ± 1.49%, n=3; RUES2 ESCs, Fig. 1c), markers of mature lung and 
airway cells were absent (not shown). The cells were surrounded by mesodermal PDGFRA
+ECAD− cells (Fig. 1d). RNAseq (Supplementary Fig. 1c) confirmed strong enrichment of 
endoderm/lung genes (FOXA2, SOX2, NKX2.1) in EPCAM+ cells (Fig. 1e). EPCAM− cells 
expressed mesodermal genes (Fig. 1e), some of which, such as TBX4 and HOX5 paralogs, 
are expressed in pulmonary mesoderm13,14. Genes expressed in mature lung and airway and 
in other AFE-derived lineages were nearly undetectable in the EPCAM+ fraction 
(Supplementary Fig. 1d). Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) was expressed in endodermal cells, and its 
transcriptional targets15, PTCH1, GLI1 and HHIP in mesoderm (Supplementary Fig. 1d). In 
situ hybridization confirmed SHH expression in the endodermal fraction at d15. At d25, 
SHH was expressed most strongly in the tips of budding epithelial structures 
(Supplementary Fig. 1e). These findings are consistent with the developing mouse lung 
where SHH is expressed throughout the pulmonary endoderm early but is limited to branch 
tips during branching morphogenesis15–17. Because they contain multiple cell types that are 
spatially organized similar to developing lung buds in vivo, we call these structures lung bud 
organoids (LBOs).
When transplanted under the kidney capsule of immunodeficient NSG mice, LBOs yielded 
growths (Fig. 2a) containing tubular structures surrounded by mesenchymal tissue after 1.5 
months (Fig. 2b). The tubes were uniformly lined by a FOXA2+NKX2.1+SOX2+ epithelium 
containing MUC5AC+ (goblet) cells with p63+ cells in the basal layer (Fig. 2c), compatible 
with airway epithelium. All cells were human (Supplementary Fig. 2a), except for 
endothelial cells, which were of mouse origin (Supplementary Fig. 2b). After 5 months, 
branching structures (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 2c) surrounded by SMA+ mesodermal 
cells arose (Supplementary Fig. 2c). All epithelial cells were NKX2.1+ while SOX2, a 
proximal marker later in lung development18,19, was excluded from the branch tips, which 
expressed SFTPB and SFTPC, markers of surfactant-producing type II alveolar epithelial 
(ATII) cells (Fig. 2e)20. The stalks and central tubules expressed the proximal (airway) 
markers FOXJ1 (ciliated cells), CC10 (club cells) and mucins (goblet cells) (Fig. 2e). 
Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed abundant multiciliated cells (Supplementary Fig. 2d), 
while live imaging documented beating cilia (Supplementary Video 1). Furthermore, 
submucosal glands were observed near the larger tubular structures (Supplementary Fig. 2e). 
Overall, morphology and expression pattern within the growths are consistent with 
proximodistal specification during lung branching morphogenesis6,7. The fluid in the tubular 
structures contained all tested secretory products of lung and airway but was negative for the 
cell surface mucin21, MUC1, indicating detection of secreted proteins and not proteins 
associated with sloughed cells, and providing evidence for function (Fig. 2f). After 7 
months, dome-shaped groups of CGRP+PGP9.5+ cells, compatible with neuroepithelial 
bodies22, were present in the airway-like structures (Fig. 2g). Furthermore, areas of the 
growths developed into a network of thin cell layers (Fig. 2g) containing cells expressing 
ATII cells markers (SFTPC, ABCA3, HT2-280)23 and cells bearing type I alveolar epithelial 
cell (ATI) markers (HT1-56, HOPX, PDPN, CAV1, SCNN1A, AKAP5, CLIC5)20, although 
other markers for mature ATI cells (RAGE, AQP5)20 were not detected (Fig. 2g). An 
alveolar capillary network and bronchoalveolar ducts were not observed, however. We 
conclude that, although full phenotypic and architectural alveolar maturation was not

 achieved, possibly at least in part because of the ectopic location, LBOs recapitulate many 
essential features of lung development, including branching morphogenesis and 
proximodistal specification, after xenotransplantation.
After embedding d25 LBOs in Matrigel in the presence of CHIR99021, FGF10, FGF7, 
BMP4 and RA (Supplementary Fig. 1b), >95% yielded rapidly expanding branching 
structures (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 3a for iPSCs, including C12, a line from a patient 
with mutations IRF7, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome after influenza 
infection)24 expressing markers of pulmonary endoderm (FOXA2+: 95.17%±1.54%, 
NKX2.1+: 74.97%± 4.37%, EPCAM+: 96.83% ± 0.62%, SOX9+: 92.42% ± 3.81% n=3 at 
d70; RUES2 ESCs) (Fig. 3b). Uniform luminal expression of MUC1 demonstrates 
polarization (Fig. 3b). Cells expressing the ATII markers SFTPC, SFTPB and ABCA3 were 
present in all structures (Fig. 3b). Airway goblet cells (MUC5B or MUC5AC) were rare 
while other airway cells (club cells (SCGB3A2), ciliated cells (FOXJ1) and basal cells 
(KRT5 and P63)) were not detected (not shown). While singly plated LBOs branched 
randomly in every direction and filled a 6.4mm well within 90 days, they formed branching 
trees that only occupied a section of the well when plated together in close proximity 
(Supplementary Fig. 3b). These findings show that branching architecture can be 
manipulated in vitro, and that repulsive interactions between branching structures may play 
a role in determining their architecture. Mesenchymal cells expressing VIMENTIN and 
CD90 were present surrounding the structures (Fig. 3b). Their proportion, as determined by 
flow cytometry for EPCAM− cells, declined during Matrigel culture to less than 2% of the 
total population however (Supplementary Fig. 3c). EPCAM+, but not EPCAM− cells, 
purified from d25 LBOs yielded branching colonies after plating in Matrigel, albeit with low 
cloning efficiency (0.30±0.0316%,) (Supplementary Fig. 3d). These branching colonies 
displayed a similar pattern of marker expression as Matrigel colonies generated from intact 
LBOs (Supplementary Fig. 3e). These findings indicate that rare progenitors in the LBOs are 
capable of generating branching colonies, and that mesenchymal cells are not required for 
branching in these culture conditions.
After >170 days, macroscopic tissue (Fig. 4a) consisting of branching tubules with dilated 
tips, reminiscent of saccules formed during the saccular stage of lung development, had 
developed (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 4a, Supplementary Video 2). 84.86%±5.21% cells 
were NKX2.1+, while most cells were SOX9+ (76.75±6.89%) and a minority (23.78±5.21%) 
were SOX2+ (Supplementary Fig. 4b) (n=4, one ESC and three iPS lines). Most luminal 
cells expressed HT2-280, MUC1, SFTPB, SFTPC and ABCA3 (RUES2 Fig. 4c, iPSCs 
Supplementary Fig. 4b), identifying these as ATII cells. Electron microscopy showed large 
numbers of lamellar bodies (LBs), the organelles where surfactant is stored25 (Fig. 4d, 
Supplementary Fig. 4c). To examine ATII cell function, we added SFTPB covalently linked 
to the fluorescent lipid, BODIPY. Within minutes, SFTPB-BODIPY was taken up by the 
cells and secreted in the lumens (Fig. 4e,f, Supplementary Video 3). Although HOPX, a 
marker of ATI cells and of putative bipotential alveolar progenitors in the mouse,20,26 was 
widely expressed (Supplementary Fig. 4b), other ATI markers (AQP5, CLIC5, AKAP5, 
CAV1, AGER) were undetectable. SOX9, a marker for the distal tips that is downregulated 
as alveoli mature and becomes undetectable postnatally, was mostly expressed at the tips and 
outer edges of the branching structures in vitro, consistent with mouse development, where

 SOX9 is a distal lung marker27–29 (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Expression of airway markers 
(MUC5AC, SCGB3A2) in the Matrigel LBO colonies was confined to structures co-
expressing SOX2 and SOX9 (Supplementary Fig. 4b), and were therefore likely more 
proximal. While co-expression of SOX2 and SOX9 is unusual in the mouse19, numerous 
larger SOX2+SOX9+ structures were identified in the human second trimester fetal distal 
lung (Supplementary Fig. 4d), suggesting that LBOs recapitulate human lung development. 
The expression of SOX9, the formation of saccular structures expressing predominantly 
ATII markers and absence of mature ATI cells are consistent with the canalicular stage of 
lung development, which occurs at the end of gestation of mice, but during the late second 
trimester in humans. To further verify the developmental stage of d170 Matrigel LBO 
cultures, we performed RNAseq on 12 independent samples from RUES2 cells and from 
three iPSC lines. Cross-referencing with the KeyGenes database, which contains expression 
profiles of human organs during first and second trimesters of gestation and adulthood30, 
showed the best match with second trimester fetal lung, without any match with other organs 
(Fig. 4g, Supplementary Fig. 4e). Together, the structural, protein expression and 
transcriptomic data indicate that the d170 Matrigel LBO organoids reached the late second 
trimester of human gestation.
We next explored whether select infectious and fibrotic lung disease could be recapitulated. 
We asked whether LBOs infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) display features of 
human lung infection. RSV is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants, 
and causes bronchiolitis with obstruction of small airways2,31. There is no licensed vaccine 
or effective antiviral drug at this time, and immunity after infection is short-lived32. RSV 
tropism in humans includes ciliated cells and alveolar epithelial cells2,3. Previous studies in 
human airway epithelial cell lines showed that cells infected with RSV swell and detach 
from the epithelium33, a finding consistent with obstruction of small airways by infected 
cells in archival pathology specimens and with the clinical syndrome of bronchiolitis3. At 
day 2 after infection of d170 Matrigel LBO cultures with RSV, confocal microscopy 
revealed shedding of swollen, infected cells into the lumen of the branching structures (Fig. 
5a, arrows, Supplementary Video 4). No shedding was seen at day 1, despite evidence of 
viral infection. RSV infection in LBOs therefore recapitulates important features of infection 
in humans.
Next, we attempted to model pulmonary fibrosis associated with some forms of Hermansky-
Pudlak Syndrome (HPS)5. HPS is characterized by pigmentation and bleeding abnormalities 
caused by abnormal biogenesis and trafficking of lysosome-related organelles (LROs), 
which include platelet dense granules and melanosomes.34 Some forms, in particular HPS1, 
are associated with early-onset and intractable pulmonary fibrosis (HPS interstitial 
pneumonia (HPSIP)) that is clinically similar Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)5, is 
characterized by fibrotic obliteration of alveoli and has a median survival of 3–4 years35. 
The fact that LBs of ATII cells are also LROs34 potentially explains the association of IPF 
with some mutations causing HPS5. Matrigel colonies derived from LBOs generation from 
RUES2 cells with CRISPR-CAS9-induced deletion of HPS1 (Supplementary Fig. 5a) 
exhibited less sharply defined branching structures in Matrigel cultures than the LBOs from 
parental RUES2 line (Fig. 5b), with an increased fraction of EPCAM− mesenchymal cells 
(Fig. 5c, Supplementary Fig. 5b), heterogeneously expressing the mesenchymal markers

 PDGFRA, PDGFRB, SMA, VIMENTIN and CD90 (Fig. 5d, low magnification tile scans in 
Supplementary Fig. 5c). The EPCAM−, but not the EPCAM+ population, showed strongly 
enhanced proliferation in cultures of RUES2-HPS1 cells compared to parental cells 
(Supplementary Fig. 5d,e), indicating that expansion of mesenchymal cells explains the 
increased fraction of EPCAM− cells. Surprisingly however, hyperproliferation of EPCAM− 
cells was already noticed in RUES2-HPS1 LBOs as early as d15 of suspension culture, prior 
to detection of any ATII markers. Furthermore, increased hydroxyproline content 
(Supplementary Fig. 5f) as well as enhanced extracellular matrix (ECM) autofluorescence 
(Supplementary Fig. 5c) and immunofluorescent staining for collagens 1 and 3 and 
fibronectin (Fig. 5d, Supplementary Fig. 5g) in RUES2-HPS1 cells indicated increased ECM 
deposition. Mixing experiments (Supplementary Fig. 5h–j) were consistent with notion that 
the accumulation of mesenchymal cells was driven by mutant epithelial cells, and not a cell 
intrinsic property of mutant mesenchymal cells, a finding consistent with the notion that 
HPSIP36 and potentially other forms of IPF4 may be caused by epithelial injury. Together, 
these findings suggest that it may be possible to model at least some fibrotic pulmonary 
disease using LBOs.
LBOs and LBO-derived branching colonies in Matrigel in vitro and growths after 
xenografting fulfill the definition of true organoids1. Previously reported human lung 
organoids did not show branching in vitro or after xenografting8,9. Furthermore, in contrast 
to LBOs, these were generated in the presence of serum, but in the absence of BMP4, RA 
and Wnt agonism, which we have shown to be essential for lung specification in vitro10. 
Finally these structures did not develop in vivo after grafting under the kidney capsule of 
immunodeficient mice, but required preculture on a bioengineered scaffold to generate 
airway epithelial cells after subcutaneous transplantation9.
We could reproduce the morphological features of RSV infection in the distal lung, for 
which there is currently no model that reproduces human infection. The LBO model also 
showed evidence of fibrosis in cells lacking HPS1, mutation of which is the most penetrant 
for a form of pulmonary fibrosis that is clinically, prognostically, radiologically and 
pathologically indistinguishable from IPF4,5,36. It is remarkable, however, that while HPSIP 
typically arises in the 3rd to 4th decade of life, a fibrotic phenotype could be reproduced in 
vitro within 40 days of directed differentiation. While it cannot be fully excluded that this in 
vitro model in fact reveals a developmental abnormality not observed in patients, it is 
possible that stress of in vitro culture recapitulated the changes induced by senescence and 
led to the very rapid appearance of the phenotype, in particular since age and telomere 
dysfunction are prime risk factors for IPF35,37.
The LBO model has limitations however. After 6 months of culture in Matrigel, the 
organoids match the second trimester of human gestation in terms of structure, marker 
expression and genome-wide expression signature. These findings suggest that lung 
development as modeled in the LBO system keeps pace with human lung development in 
utero. Full, terminal maturation therefore remains a challenge in the organoid field1. A 
second limitation is that branching appears random, a finding consistent with a, as yet 
unproven, ‘space-filling’ model of branching morphogenesis38. However, branching could 
be directed by plating several LBOs in close proximity to each other in Matrigel, in which

 case the organoids branch away from each other, suggesting that branching can be 
manipulated in vitro. A third limitation is that the exact nature and patterning of the 
mesenchyme present in the LBOs is unclear. In vivo xenografting revealed that LBO-
associated mesodermal cells do not have the potential to generate endothelial cells, bone or 
skeletal muscle, suggesting that the mesenchyme is specified to some extent. The various 
mesenchymal lineages in the lung and their ontogeny are still poorly characterized.6 
Pulmonary vasculature is likely not derived from pulmonary mesenchyme however. 
Proximal pulmonary vessels are derived from a common cardiopulmonary mesenchymal 
progenitor, while the development origin of the alveolar capillary network likely arises from 
VE-cadherin+ progenitors arising in preexisting trunk vessels.6,39 A fourth limitation is that 
the in vitro cultures are strongly biased towards distal lung, and, although some areas co-
expressing SOX2 and SOX9 expressed more proximal markers for goblet cells and club cell 
precursors, mature club cells, ciliated cells or basal cells were not observed. We could also 
not achieve induction of ATI markers in vitro, although ATI potential is present after 
engraftment in vivo. It is possible that the cultures were not sufficiently mature to allow 
development of ATI cells. Alternatively, our current culture condition may drive 
differentiation of distal progenitor towards ATII cells at the expense of ATI cells.
Taken together, this work indicates that, despite certain limitations, LBOs will be a useful 
tool for the study of human lung development and possibly for lung disease modeling.
METHODS
Reagents
Reagents used are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
Human samples
The use of human fetal tissues procured by the Human Studies Core at Columbia Center for 
Translational Immunology was approved by the Columbia University Medical Center 
(CUMC) Human research review committee and the experiments were performed in 
accordance with the approved protocols.
Media
hPSC maintenance media consisted of DMEM/F12 (1:1) supplemented with 20% knockout 
serum replacement, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, Primocin, and 20 ng/ml FGF-2. Serum-free 
differentiation (SFD) media consisted of IMDM/Ham’s F12 (3:1) supplemented with N2, 
B27, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid, 
2mM Glutamax, 0.4 µM monothioglycerol and different growth factor cocktails as indicated 
in Supplementary Table 2.
hPSCs Maintenance
Rockefeller University Embryonic Stem Cell Line 2 (RUES2, NIH approval number 
NIHhESC-09-0013, Registration number 0013, passage 17–28), Sendai Virus and modified 
mRNA generated hiPSC lines from healthy human dermal fibroblasts7,9 (passage 16–25) 
and IRF7-deficient C12 hiPSC lines28 were maintained on mouse embryonic fibroblasts

 (MEFs) plated at 15,000–18,000 cells/cm2. Cells were cultured in hPSC maintenance media 
and medium was changed daily. hPSCs were passaged with Accutase/EDTA washed and 
replated at a dilution of 1:48. Cultures were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere 
at 37°C. Lines are karyotyped and verified for Mycoplasma contamination using PCR every 
6 months.
Endoderm induction
Induction of endoderm was carried as previous described9. Briefly, MEFs were depleted by 
passaging onto Matrigel for 24 h supplied with hPSC maintenance media and maintained in 
a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. After MEF depletion, primitive streak and 
embryoid body induction was performed in embryoid bodies/primitive streak formation 
media (Supplementary Table 2) in low attachment plates for 12–16 h followed by switching 
to endoderm induction media (Supplementary Table 2) for 36–40 h. Embryoid bodies were 
fed every day and maintained in a humidified 5% CO2/5% O2 atmosphere at 37°C. 
Endoderm yield was determined by the expression of CXCR4 and c-KIT. For iPS lines, 
endodermal cells were purified using human CD184 (CXCR4) MicroBead kit. Cells used in 
all experiments had > 90% endoderm yield.
Anterior foregut endoderm induction
Anterior foregut endoderm was induced as previous described9. On day 4, embryoid bodies 
were dissociated with 0.05% Trypsin/EDTA and plated on fibronectin-coated multiple well 
plates with a density at 80,000–105,000 cells/cm2. Cells were incubated in Anteriorization 
media-1 for 24 h followed by switching to Anteriorization media-2 for another 24 h.
Formation of lung bud organoids
At the end of anterior foregut endoderm induction, cells were treated with Ventralization 
media (Branching media) for 48 h and three-dimensional clump formation was observed. 
The clumps were then suspended by gently pipetting around the wells. The suspended 
clumps are called lung bud organoids (LBOs) hereafter. LBOs were maintained in non-tissue 
culture treated multiple-well plates submerged in Branching media and were fed every other 
day until d20–d25.
Branching morphogenesis in Matrigel
The d20-d25 LBOs were embedded in 100% Matrigel in 24-well transwell inserts and 
incubated in incubator until the Matrigel solidified. Branching media were added to the well, 
after which the transwell was inserted, branching media added into the transwell insert as 
well. Media were changed every other day. A step-by-step protocol describing the 
generation of LBOs and LBO-derived branching colonies in Matrigel can be found at Nature 
Protocol Exchange41.
Immunofluorescence staining
LBOs and branching Matrigel cultures were freshly embedded in Optimal Cutting 
Temperature (OCT). Samples were sectioned between 5–8 µm, and then air dried for 2 
hours. The sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room

 temperature (RT) and washed with DPBS for 5 minutes. The sections were permeabilized 
with 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS for 30 minutes followed by blocking in 5% donkey serum for 1 
hour. Primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 3) were incubated at 4°C overnight. The 
next day, sections were washed with DPBS 3 × 5 minutes followed by secondary antibody 
(Supplementary Table 3) incubation for 2 hours at RT, washed 3 × 10 minutes with DPBS 
then mounted with DAPI contained fluorescent mounting medium. For 3D imaging, D25 
LBOs were stained as described above, but were stained as intact organoids.
Isolation of EPCAM+ and EPCAM− population from LBOs
LBOs were dissociated by 0.05% Trypsin/EDTA. The cells were stained with APC-
conjugated EPCAM for 20 minutes at 4°C. EPCAM+ and EPCAM− cells were isolated by 
Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) using a BD Influx Cell Sorter (San Jose, CA).
RNAseq
Total RNA from LBOs was purified using Direct-zol™ RNA MicroPrep kit. RNA 
concentration and RNA integrity number (RIN) were determined using an Agilent 
microfluidic RNA 6000 Nano Chip kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) on the 2100 
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Those samples with RIN greater than 
9 were used for RNAseq. Poly-A-pull-down was used to enrich mRNAs from total RNA 
samples. Libraries were prepared using Illumina TruSeq RNA prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, 
CA). Libraries were then sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq2000 (Illumina, San Diego, 
CA) at the Columbia Genome Center. Samples were multiplexed in each lane, yielding a 
targeted number of single-end/pair-end 100bp reads for each sample, as a fraction of 180 
million reads for the whole lane. RTA (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was used for base calling 
and bc12fastq (version 1.8.4) for converting BCL to fastq format, coupled with adaptor 
trimming. Reads were mapped to a reference genome (NCBI/build37.2) using Tophat 
(version 2.0.4) with 4 mismatches and 10 maximum multiple hits. To tackle the mapping of 
reads that are from exon-exon junctions, Tophat infers novel exon-exon junctions ab initio, 
and combines them with junctions from known mRNA sequences as the reference 
annotation. We estimated the relative abundance of genes and splice isoforms using cufflinks 
(version 2.0.2) with default settings. We tested for differentially expressed genes under 
various conditions using DEseq, an R package based on a negative binomial distribution that 
models the number reads from RNAseq experiments and tests for differential expression.
In situ hybridization
In situ hybridization was performed on frozen sections (5–8 µm) using digoxigenin (DIG)-
UTP-labeled SHH riboprobes. Briefly, human adult lung tissue cDNA was used as template 
to generate SHH PCR products containing either T7 or T3 promoter sequences (Forward: 
AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGACAGCTCGGAAGTCATCAGTT; Reverse: 
TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGG CCTCTGAGTGGTGGCCATCTT). The PCR products 
were used as templates to generate SHH riboprobes using T7 MAXIscript kit (Ambion) 
followed by RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen) to clean up the riboprobes. Different stages of the 
LBOs freshly embedded in OCT. Samples were sectioned between 5–8 µm followed by 
fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes RT. The sections were washed with 
DEPC-DPBS for 3× 5 minutes and acetylated in acetylation buffer (584 µl of

 triethanolamine/50 ml of DEPC-H2O/125 µl acetic anhydride) for 10 minutes. 
Permeabilization was carried in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 30 minutes at RT followed by 
washed with DEPC-DPBS 3 × 5 minutes. The sections were incubated with hybridization 
buffer (5% dextran sulfate/4× SSC/50% formamide/1× Denhardt’s/5% fish sperm DNA) for 
at least 2 hours at RT then overnight with 200 ng/ml of DIG-labeled SHH probe in 
hybridization buffer at 72°C. The next day, sections were incubated with 0.2× SSC pre-
warmed to 72°C for 2 hours followed by cool down to RT for 30 minutes. The sections were 
washed with fresh 0.2× SSC for 5 minutes then PBS for another 5 minutes. The sections 
were incubated with blocking solution (2% sheep serum/TBST) for 1 hour followed by anti-
DIG-AP Ig overnight at 4°C. The sections were washed with TBST 3 × 10 minutes and 
rinsed in color reaction buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 9.5/0.1% Tween-20/100 mM NaCl/50 mM 
MgCl2) for 10 minutes. Color was developed by incubating the section with BM-purple.
Mouse kidney capsule transplantation
The NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid.Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free 
mouse facility. All the mice used at 10–13 weeks of age and not selected for gender. The 
experiment was set up to use 5–7 mice per time point. No statistical method was used to 
predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized. Experiments and animal 
care were performed in accordance with the protocols approved by The Columbia University 
Institutional Animal Care And Use Committee. One million of d20-d25 LBO cells were 
mixed with 5 µl Matrigel prior to surgery and implanted under the kidney capsule. 
Outgrowths were excised, embedded freshly in OCT for immunofluorescence or fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde for paraffin embedding. Histology was analyzed using hematoxylin/eosin 
staining.
Dot blots
Three microliter of fluid aspirated from the tubular structures of 5 month grafts was 
deposited onto a nitrocellulose blotting membrane (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The dot-
blot membrane was air-dried for 5 minutes, and blocked in 5% milk/PBS for 1 hour and then 
probed with the indicated primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 3) overnight at 4°C. 
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies was applied to the membranes followed by signal 
detection with ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents and exposure to X-ray film.
Imaging
Samples were imaged using motorized Leica DMI6000 B (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo 
Grove, IL) or DMi8 (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) inverted microscopes or 2-
photon confocal laser scanning microscope Leica TCS SP8 (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo 
Grove, IL). Macroscopic images (Fig. 3a and Fig. 5a) were taken using iPhone 6 (Model: 
MG5A2LL/A, Apple, Cupertino, CA).
Quantification of immunofluorescence
Images for each nuclear marker were quantified using ImageJ. Briefly, images were 
converted to 8-bit images and the threshold was adjusted to correspond with the nuclear 
stain, which allows for measurement of total area. The total area was analyzed by the

 “Analyze Particles” function of ImageJ. Percentage of positive cells were calculated by 
dividing the total area of positive cells over the total area of DAPI. For extracellular matrix 
quantification, fluorescence intensity was quantified using Leica Application Suite X. The 
values were normalized to the RUES2 control for each individual experiment before 
statistical analysis.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was performed at the NYU Langone Medical 
Center Microscopy Core. LBOs were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium 
cacodylate buffer (pH7.2) for 2 hours and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1.5 hours 
at room temperature, then processed in a standard manner and embedded in EMbed 812 
(Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Semi-thin sections were cut at 1 mm and 
stained with 1% Toluidine Blue to evaluate the quality of preservation and find the area of 
interest. Ultrathin sections (60 nm) were cut, mounted on copper grids and stained with 
uranyl acetate and lead citrate by standard methods. Stained grids were examined under 
Philips CM-12 electron microscope and photographed with a Gatan (4k ×2.7k) digital 
camera (Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA).
Generation of RUES2-HPS1 line
The RUES2-HPS1 line was generated at the Stem Cell Core Facility at Columbia University 
Medical Center. Briefly, RUES2 cells (passage 25) were cultured in six-well plates coated 
with Matrigel to 70–80% confluence. Cells were electroporated with 7.5 µg of HPS1 guide 
RNA plasmid plus 2.5 µg of Cas9mCherry per well of a 6-well plate using Nucleofector 4D. 
Cas9mCherry-derived mCherry was used as a fluorescent marker to sort transfected cells. 
Twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were sorted using FACS with a Bio-Rad S3e cell 
sorter and seeded at ~2,000 cells/6 cm dish on MEF feeders. Colonies were picked 7–10 
days post sorting. Genomic DNAs from individual clones were isolated and genotyping was 
done using HPS1-specific PCR primers (HPS1-F-1 (GTAGAGGCAGCAGATCCAAGAGG) 
and HPS1-R-1 (GAACAAGGTGGTCCACACA). 420 bp band to be expected). The PCR 
products were cloned into a plasmid for proper sequence using In-Fusion reaction (Clontech, 
Mountain View,CA). Sequencing revealed premature stop codons in each allele 
(Supplementary Fig. 5).
Uptake of SPB-BODIPY in live LBOs and quantification
d170 LBOs were stained with CellMask™ Deep Red Plasma membrane Stain for 10 
minutes and washed for 5 times followed by imaging prior loading SPB-BODIPY to 
obtained background fluorescence levels (0 min). The cultures then were loaded with 20 
ng/ml purified human SPB-BODIPY protein (10 ng in total per culture) directly on top of 
the Matrigel. Images were taken every 2 minutes using a 2-photon confocal laser scanning 
microscope (Leica TCS SP8) and the fluorescent intensities were quantified using Leica 
Application Suite X. The background fluorescence values were subtracted from all 
measurements before statistical analysis.

 Hydroxyproline content
Hydroxyproline content was measured followed manufacture’s protocol (Sigma, 
MAK008-1KT). Briefly, samples from RUES2 or RUES2-HPS1 cultures were homogenized 
by tissue glass Teflon dounce homogenizer (10 mg samples in 100 µl of water) and 
transferred to a pressure-tight vial followed by adding 100 µl of concentrated hydrochloric 
acid (~ 12M) per 10 mg of sample. The mixtures were hydrolyzed at 120°C for 3 hours. 
Samples were dried in a 96 well plate at 60°C followed by Chloramine T/Oxidation Buffer 
Mixture for 5 mins at RT and DMAB reagent for another 90 mins at 60°C. Hydroxyproline 
content were measured at 560 nm. The same amount of Matrigel was used as control.
Comparative analysis using KeyGenes
RNAseq data obtained from d170 LBOs from RUES2, C12, HDF SV and HDF mRNA lines 
was compared to different first and second trimesters and adult organs, including the lungs, 
using KeyGenes. Hierarchical clustering of 12 samples of the d170 LBOs and 75 samples 
from 19 organs from second trimester was performed using Cluster 3.0 and viewed by 
TreeView. The 87 classifier genes were calculated by KeyGenes.
Respiratory syncytial virus preparation and infection
Recombinant red fluorescent protein (RFP)-expressing RSV A2 (rrRSV) was generated 
from the full-length RSV plasmid1, MP224 by replacing the enhanced green fluorescent 
protein gene with the wild-type Discosoma RFP gene from pDsRed. For cell maintenance, 
HEp-2 cells (ATCC no. CCL-23) and Vero cells (ATCC no. CCL-81) were grown in 
monolayer culture and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) 
and 2 mM L-glutamine in a humidified atmosphere with 5%CO2 at 37 °C. Viral stocks were 
prepared in HEp-2 cells (ATCC no. CCL-23). Briefly, HEp-2 cells were grown overnight, 
washed with OptiMEM, and inoculated with rrRSV. After a 2.5-h adsorption period the cells 
were incubated for 3 days in DMEM supplemented with 1% FCS. Virus was harvested by 
one freeze-thaw cycle followed by a clarifying centrifugation at 3,500 r.p.m. and stored at 
−80 °C. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay in Vero cells using a 2% methyl 
cellulose overlay, 5% (v/v) formaldehyde fixation, and crystal violet staining (0.015% w/v) 
at 5 days. For RSV infection of d170 LBOs, 107 plaque-forming units (PFU) of RSV in 1 ml 
was directly added onto each Matrigel culture in wells and incubated for 3 hrs at 37 °C. The 
RSV inocula were then removed and the cultures were washed with SFD media 5 times for 5 
minutes and maintained in branching media. The cultures were collected at indicated time 
points for whole mount staining using anti-RSV (all antigens) antibody (Meridian Life 
Science, B65890G). Images were taking using inverted microscopes or 2-photon confocal 
laser scanning microscope Leica TCS SP8 (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL).
