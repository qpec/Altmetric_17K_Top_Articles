Abstract
Precision medicine in cancer proposes that genomic characterization of tumors can inform 
personalized targeted therapies1–5. This proposition, however, is complicated by spatial and 
temporal heterogeneity6–14. Here we study genomic and expression profiles across 127 multi-
sector or longitudinal specimens from 52 glioblastoma (GBM) patients. Using bulk and single-cell 
data, we find that samples from the same tumor mass share genomic and expression signatures, 
while geographically separated multifocal tumors and/or long-term recurrent tumors are seeded 
from different clones. Chemical screening of patient-derived glioma cells (PDCs) shows that 
therapeutic response is associated to genetic similarity, and multifocal tumors enriched with 
PIK3CA mutations have a heterogeneous drug response pattern. Importantly, we show that 
targeting truncal events is more efficacious in reducing tumor burden. In summary, this work 
demonstrates that evolutionary inference from integrated genomic analysis in multi-sector biopsies 
can inform targeted therapeutic interventions for GBM patients.
Main Text
In glioblastoma (GBM) most clinical trials on targeted therapy have shown limited clinical 
success15. Although recent genome-wide studies evaluating regional heterogeneity9,11 and 
longitudinal GBM pairs8,12,14,16 have suggested potential evolutionary models, there is little 
understanding which strategies can effectively use genomic data to inform targeted 
therapies. To identify such strategies, we analyzed somatic variants in 127 multi-region or 
longitudinal tumor specimens from 52 glioma patients: 42 from Samsung Medical Center 
(SMC) Seoul, South Korea, and 10 from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) GBM 
cohort8,14,16 (Supplementary Table 1). Additionally, we analyzed transcriptomes of 83 tumor 
specimens from 41 patients (bulk) and 305 single cells from seven samples of three patients. 
Tumors were classified into three distinct groups according to spatial and temporal tissue 
acquisition: from the same location and time (locally adjacent), from different locations at 
the same time (multifocal/multicentric, referred as multiple)17, and from local and distant 
recurrences at different times (longitudinal local or distant, respectively) (Fig. 1a).
We inferred clonal and subclonal alterations from cancer cell fractions in multiple sectors 
(Methods, Supplementary Table 2). The average mutation rate was 2.2 mut/Mb for non-
hypermutated samples, consistent with previous studies2,14. IDH1 R132 mutations were 
clonal across all the regions in IDH mutant tumors2,14 (6/6). PIK3CA mutations were always 
clonal and shared in all sectors (5/5), consistent with our previous longitudinal analysis from 
tumor evolution directed graphs (TEDG) that PIK3CA mutations are early events14 (Fig. 1b, 
Supplementary Fig. 1a–b). Furthermore, FGFR3-TACC3 fusions were highly expressed in 
all regions from two patients18. These somatic variants that are shared in all tumor regions 
represent promising therapeutic targets14,19, as they reflect truncal alterations suspected to 
be present among all tumor cells. In contrast, PTEN alterations including copy number

 deletions and mutations were shared in 10/20 (50%) and 5/7 (71.4%) tumor sectors, 
respectively. Likewise, EGFR amplifications were observed as private events in 4/15 
(26.7%) of EGFR-amplified tumors, including two multiple cases (GBM5 and GBM9). 
Furthermore, EGFR mutations were shared in 3/7 (42.9%) cases, including one harboring 
disjoint alterations (GBM7-I1: L62R and R108K; GBM7-I2: A289V and C624S), 
suggesting that partial genetic information of a single tumor biopsy can be inconclusive for 
assessing EGFR targeted therapy (Supplementary Fig. 1b–c).
To understand the association between spatiotemporal architecture and genetic relevance, we 
calculated Nei’s genetic distance among multi-sector samples from the same patient 
(Methods). Genetic diversity is greater in multiple tumors compared to locally-adjacent 
tissues (q=4.7e-5, Fig. 2a), in distant compared to local recurrence (q=1.4e-5, Fig. 2a), and 
in long-term recurrence compared to short-term recurrence (q=2.9e-3, Fig. 2a). A 
multinomial logistic regression was applied to classify multi-sector sample pairs based on 
genomic features (Supplementary Note). This analysis has highlighted that tumors from 
distant regions or longer period separation compose a distinct evolutionary scenario in GBM 
(Figure 2b). In colorectal tumors, a Big Bang model20 interprets that cells from different 
biopsies of the same tumor share clonal and subclonal variants (Fig. 2c, left panel). 
Consistent with this model, samples taken from locally adjacent tumors share a large 
proportion of clonal and subclonal events (Supplementary Fig. 2a–b). In contrast, multiple 
tumors contain fewer shared (higher private) clonal mutations compared to local (q=1.86e-3, 
Supplementary Fig. 2a). We corroborated this finding by computing statistics on the space of 
evolutionary trees (evolutionary moduli spaces, Supplementary Fig. 3, Methods). Local 
tumors clustered near the tip of the space, indicating a higher shared mutation ratio 
compared to multiple tumors (p=1.27e-2). These results indicate that in contrast to local 
tumors, geographically separated multifocal tumors and/or long-term recurrent tumors are 
seeded from distinct clones, a phenomenon we call the ‘Multiverse model’ (Fig. 2c, right 
panel). Unlike the Big Bang model20, in the Multiverse model, tumor samples from different 
tumor masses share very few genomic alterations, indicating tumor clones are 
geographically segregated at an early stage of evolution, and each clone acquires distinct 
“private” alterations, leading to the construction of multiple “universes”.
Next, we investigated the mutation profiles of GBMs with multifocal/multicentric (M-GBM) 
or solitary (S-GBM) lesion in 160 treatment naïve patients from both SMC and TCGA17 
cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 4 and 5a, Supplementary Table 3, Methods). Notably, non-
synonymous mutations of PIK3CA were enriched in M-GBM (13/130 and 9/30 tumors in S- 
and M-GBMs respectively, p=7.905e-3, Fig. 2d). This conclusion remains the same in IDH1 
wild type cohort (Supplementary Fig. 5b). PIK3CA induces multipotency of mammary 
tumors, suggesting its associative role in tumor multiplicity21. Survival analysis indicates 
that both M-GBM and PIK3CA mutant patients have worse prognosis (p-values: 0.0151 and 
0.039, respectively, Supplementary Fig. 5c–d).
To further characterize the heterogeneity of expression profiles, we curated single cell RNA-
Seq of seven different samples from three patients. Overall, expression-based cell subtypes 
were not clearly determined by location or time (Fig. 3), consistent with a previous report10. 
To make sure this observation is not due to the limitations of this classification and to

 capture the transcriptional similarity among different cells, we used topological data analysis 
(Methods), a recently developed technique to summarize and reduce the dimensionality of 
large data sets while retaining local high dimensional structure22,23.
GBM9 (Figs. 3a–d) consisted of samples from two primary tumors in the right and left 
frontal lobes, and a recurrent tumor in the left frontal lobe that emerged after concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and EGFR targeted treatment (Supplementary Note). We found 
in bulk whole exome sequencing (WES) and confirmed using ultra-deep sequencing 
(Supplementary Table 4) and single-cell analysis that cells from the recurrent tumor shared 
genomic and expression features with the left initial tumor cells (Supplementary Figs. 6–8, 
Fig. 3b). Particularly, there are 61 somatic mutations shared between left and recurrent, 
while only 42 between right and recurrent. Single-cell transcriptome analysis showed EGFR 
expression predominantly in the right tumor mass, but not in the left and recurrent tumors 
(Fig. 3c). Interestingly, different single cells harbor different EGFR alterations, implying 
they were late events during tumor evolution21. PIK3CA mutations were detected from 
single cells in all three samples, consistent with the bulk WES that PIK3CA mutations are 
founder events (Supplementary Figs. 1a and 6a). Our analysis also revealed the presence of 
transcriptional heterogeneity within the individual samples. A subset of left-initial tumor 
cells was characterized by upregulation of mitotic genes not found in either right or recurrent 
sections (Fig. 3d).
Additionally, we profiled IDH1 mutant tumor cells distinguished by 5-Aminolevulinic acid 
(5-ALA) uptake pattern (populations stained for tumor cellularity24) (GBM10, Fig. 3e–f, 
Supplementary Figs. 6–7). Previous glioma studies suggested that low pathologic grade is 
associated with low uptake of 5-ALA24,25; however, genomic determinants for 5-ALA 
uptake remain elusive. Using single cell transcriptome analysis, we found predominant 
enrichment of proneural cells on 5-ALA (-) sample, supporting previous observations that 
GBM cells may be evolved from proneural precursors (p<0.01, Fig. 3e,)26. We also found 
enrichment of several cell proliferation and migration markers in the 5-ALA (+) section, 
including MET and CD4427–29. Notably, 5-ALA (-) tumors, which are conceived as less 
aggressive, are actually fully-fledged tumors that harbor driver mutations and express tumor 
aggressive markers (Fig. 3e and 3f, Supplementary Fig. 6b, 7, 9a and 10). Finally, we 
studied main and margin samples from GBM2—a locally adjacent hypermutated case, and 
found distinct subpopulations of cells expressing mitotic cell markers and migration-
associated genes, including CD44 (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Figs. 6–7, Supplementary Figs. 
9–10)28.
To investigate the influence of genetic heterogeneity on drug response, we isolated 28 PDCs 
from 11 patients and screened 40 different cancer-related compounds (Supplementary Table 
5)4,30. We found that Nei’s genetic distance was associated with drug response correlation 
(p=0.02; Fig. 4a). Consistently, both distant and longitudinal samples showed significantly 
broader drug responses compared to local samples (Fig. 4b). Importantly, we found that the 
PDCs from M-GBMs were more sensitive to PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) pathway inhibitors 
than those from solitary tumors (p=1.872e-6, Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 11). This 
indicates that PAM inhibitors could provide clinical benefit for M-GBMs. In addition, we

 observed that PDCs from recurrent GBMs were more resistant to EGFR inhibitors, 
compared to initial (p=2.9e-4, Supplementary Figs. 12–13).
We hypothesized that clonal alterations found in all multi-sector samples (truncal 
alterations) represent better molecular targets. In agreement with this truncal target 
hypothesis (Supplementary video), multisector PDCs were more sensitive to drugs that 
target shared alterations compared to private alterations (p=0.0381, Methods, Fig. 4d; 
Supplementary Figs. 14–16). The Multiverse model implies that the extensive genetic 
diversity of multiple tumors presents a special challenge. Accordingly, GBM9 showed a 
divergent genetic profile and a highly heterogeneous drug response (Fig. 4e–f). PDCs from 
the right-side tumor were highly sensitive to EGFR inhibitors but not to MEK inhibitors, and 
vice-versa in the left side tumor. However, PAM pathway inhibitors were ubiquitously 
effective, consistent with our hypothesis that targeting the PAM signaling pathway could be 
a potent option to treat M-GBMs (Fig. 4c,f). Yet not all truncal alterations can serve as drug 
targets. For example, “gatekeeper” genes, which are necessary for tumor initiation but no 
longer required for tumor maintenance, are not good candidates31. Although targeting 
subclonal mutations show limited effect, patients might still benefit from the elimination of a 
subclone that has a bystander effect on surrounding cells.
In conclusion, based on comprehensive bulk and single cell analyses, we have proposed a 
Multiverse model to interpret the evolution of multiple GBMs. We showed M-GBMs are 
more genetically diverse than locally adjacent tumors, and genetic similarity between multi-
region samples is associated with consistent drug response. Specifically, we found an 
enrichment of PIK3CA mutations in M-GBMs and that PAM inhibitors are more effective in 
PDCs from this cohort. These findings support the truncal target hypothesis that truncal 
mutations can inform more effective therapies.
Online Methods
Glioma specimens and their derivative cells
After receiving informed consents, glioma specimens and clinical records were obtained 
from patients undergoing surgery at Samsung Medical Center (SMC) or Seoul National 
University Hospital (SNUH) in accordance with its Institutional Review Board (IRB file No. 
2010–04-004). Surgical samples measuring approximately 5 × 5 × 5 mm3 were snap-frozen 
using liquid nitrogen for genomic analysis. We also curated whole exome and/or RNA 
sequencing of 33 multisector specimens from 10 GBM patients in TCGA cohort8, and 22 
previously reported GBM longitudinal pairs14,16. To investigate the genomic characteristics 
of solitary and multifocal/multicentric GBMs, we curated 83 and 77 tumor exome 
sequencing data with matched normal DNA from SMC and TCGA8,17, respectively. 
Portions of the surgical samples were enzymatically dissociated into single cells, following 
the procedures reported previously with modification of immune cell depletion33. Tumor 
cells were cultured in neurobasal media with N2 and B27 supplements (0.5× each; 
Invitrogen) and human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and epidermal 
growth factor (EGF; 20 ng/ml each; R&D Systems). The patient-derived cells (PDCs) used 
here had shown no obvious contamination of mycoplasma.

 Radiological evaluation
Both T1-weighted contrast-enhancement (T1CE) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery 
(FLAIR)/T2 axial images of 160 treatment-naïve GBMs (83 and 77 tumors from SMC and 
TCGA cohort, respectively) were reviewed. MR images of TCGA cohort have been obtained 
from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) website17,34,35. We excluded cases with any 
evidence of prior neurosurgical intervention except biopsy, lack of treatment history, or loss 
of T1CE or FLAIR/T2 images. To distinguish the multifocal/multicentric GBMs (M-GBM) 
from solitary ones (S-GBMs), we adapted annotations from the VASARI feature set for 
human glioma36. According to VASARI feature set, m-GBMs are defined as having at least 
one region of tumor, either enhancing or non-enhancing, which is not contiguous with the 
main lesion and is outside of the region of signal abnormality (edema) surrounding the main 
mass17,37,38. When FLAIR/T2 high signal intensity lesion resides outside of the T1-
weighted contrast-enhancement lesion, this lesion is considered as separate tumor foci and 
counted as multifocal tumor in our study39,40. In contrast, tumors which present separate 
contrast-enhancement lesions within the FLAIR/T2 high-signal intensity background are 
considered as solitary ones.
Whole-exome sequencing
Agilent SureSelect kit was used for capturing the exonic DNA fragments. Illumina 
HiSeq2000 was used for sequencing and generated 2 × 101 bp paired-end reads.
Somatic mutation
The sequenced reads in FASTQ files were aligned to the human genome assembly (hg19) 
using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner version 0.6.2. The initial alignment BAM files were 
subjected to conventional preprocessing before mutation calling: sorting, removing 
duplicated reads, locally realigning reads around potential small indels, and recalibrating 
base quality scores using SAMtools, Picard version 1.73 and Genome Analysis ToolKit 
(GATK) version 2.5.2. We used MuTect (version 1.1.4) and Somatic IndelDetector (GATK 
version 2.2) to make high-confidence predictions on somatic mutations from the neoplastic 
and non-neoplastic tissue pairs. Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) version 73 was used to 
annotate the called somatic mutations. Additionally, we ran SAVI (Statistical Variant 
Identification) software to call somatic variants and indels for refining the mutation calls 
from the above pipeline.
Copy number
Excavator was used to generate estimated copy number alterations in tumor specimens 
compared to its matching non-neoplastic part. For each gene we calculated the copy number 
=2x+1 , where x is the segmentation mean from Excavator and defined as the log2 fold-
change of tumor divided by normal. The gene was labeled as “amplified” when the copy 
number was ≥ 3 and “deleted” when it was ≤ 1.
Cancer cell fractions and clonality
We ran ABSOLUTE41 using input of genomic variants and copy number data to infer 
sample purity and cancer cell fractions (CCF) and removed those having <20% purity. We

 considered mutations as clonal if indicated clonal in Absolute and with a cancer cell fraction 
of 80% or having CCF of 100% and not marked as clonal or subclonal. The Absolute CCF 
estimates with regard to hypermutated samples appeared disproportionately subclonal in 
sample GBM18 inital and TCGA-14-1402 2nd recurrence and we reasoned the large 
mutational load may skew estimates. In hyper mutated samples treatment-associated 
mutation coupled with defects in mismatch repair are deemed largely responsible for a 
majority of observed mutations. Therefore, mutations having cancer cell fractions greater 
than or equal to the maximum mismatch repair CCF were marked clonal in these two 
samples.
If a mutation was found to be clonal in all sectors of a patient’s tumor, it was inferred to be 
clonal throughout the entire tumor. We investigated the number of sequenced tumor sectors 
or cores needed to obtain a reasonable false discovery rate (FDR) for this inference of 
clonality. We analyzed glioma patient LGG174 published recently by Suzuki et al., where 
nine sectors from different locations of the same tumor mass were sequenced. Based on 
Figure 7b from their paper42, 13 mutations have high cell fraction (>60%) shared by all 
samples. To relate the number of sectors sequenced to the number of mutations deemed to be 
clonal tumor-wide, we exhausted all possible sub-sampling strategies (number of cores k = 
1, 2, …, 9), and calculated the reported clonal mutations based on k cores. For example, if 
there are two cores (k=2), there are 
 potential sampling strategies. We found that 22 
out of 36 sampling strategies contained no false discoveries in identifying clonal mutation. 
For each value of k, we calculated FDR (Supplementary Fig. 17). Almost 90% of clonal 
mutations identified by two-core sequencing are true clonal mutations, and over 95% 
identified by three-core sequencing are true clonal mutations.
Nei genetic distances
Nei’s genetic distance is used in population genetics to assess the similarity between 
populations, taking into account heterogeneity within populations. Samples containing the 
same spatial or longitudinal category (Local, 5-ALA, Multiple Lesion, Longitudinal Local, 
Longitudinal Distant) were retained for statistical comparisons. We calculated Nei distance 
of CCF for each patient’s sample as follows. Let X = all CCF of sample 1 and Y = all CCF 
of sample 2:
The multiverse model of tumor evolution
We found increased Nei’s genetic distance in Multi-focal/multi-centric compared with 
locally-adjacent biopsies. In addition, private clonal mutations appear frequently in multi-
sectional and distant longitudinal samples, but are infrequent in local samples 
(Supplementary Figure 2a). This spurred a hypothesis that specific early event(s) can give 
rise to distinct mutational profiles in spatially separated tumors (Figure 2A). These 
differences in mutational load suggested distinct tumor profiles may arise in separate 
‘universes’ of clones rather than from one large growth period followed by diversification.

 For each somatic mutation we record the clonal status as determined by ABSOLUTE and if 
the mutation is shared or private or if the clonal status changes between biopsies. Mutations 
are then classified into 5 patterns between every available pair of a patient’s samples. The 
mutational classes are labeled as the following: CC (clonal-clonal), CS (clonal-subclonal), 
SS (subclonal-subclonal), CX (clonal-absent) or SX (subclonal-absent). Order of the sample 
pair is not important: a mutation that is clonal in one sample and subclonal in the other is 
marked “CS,” regardless of sample identity.
These mutational classifications were used to predict whether the spatiotemporal 
configuration of a sample pair fell into one of three groups: locally adjacent, local 
longitudinal, or multi-sectional/distant-longitudinal. The fractions of mutations in a sample 
pair that fit each of the five patterns were used as features in a multinomial-logistic 
regression. Predictions were then made using leave-one-out cross validation.
Mutational pairs plotted on the simplex allowed us to visually separate multi-sectional/
distant-longitudinal, locally adjacent or local longitudinal sections in agreement with most 
of our MRI classifications. The simplex axes represent the predicted probabilities of 
outcomes for each observation. Curiously, the sample layout contained 3 longitudinal local 
outliers closest to the multi-sectional point of the simplex. The time interval between 
surgeries of the 3 pairs was 18 months or more. Moreover, their Nei distances were 
significantly different from all other sections (p-value = 0.01652). We labeled all samples 
exceeding surgical intervals of 18 months as long-term recurrence and colored them in dark 
green. Analysis was performed in the [R] computing environment using the multinom 
function from the nnet package (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nnet).
Isolation of single cells and RNA sequencing
We adopted the C1TM Single-Cell Auto Prep System (Fluidigm) with the SMARTer kit 
(Clontech) to generate cDNAs from single cells. 352R and L cells were captured as a single 
isolate in C1 chip (17–25 μm) determined by microscopic examination as previous 
described. RNAs from pooled samples were also processed using the SMARTer kit with 
10ng of starting materials. Libraries were generated using Nextera XT DNA Sample Prep 
Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on the HiSeq 2500 using the 100bp paired-end mode of the 
TruSeq Rapid PE Cluster kit and TruSeq Rapid SBS kit. Before mapping RNA sequencing 
reads to the reference, reads were filtered out at Q33 by using Trimmomatic-0.30. TPM 
values were calculated from each single cell (as if they are different samples) using RSEM 
(version 1.2.25)43 and expressed as log2(1+TPM).
Gene fusion detection
Chimerascan was applied to generate candidate list of gene fusions44. For bulk sequencing, 
only previously reported in-frame, high expressing fusions, such as FGFR3-TACC318, 
MGMT fusion14, EGFR-SEPT145 and ATRX fusion were considered in this manuscript. For 
single cell fusion analysis, if a fusion was highly expressed and independently detected in 
multiple cells the fusion will be reported.

 Expression based subtypes determination
Gene expression was measured by RSEM and then log2 transformed. To determine the 
expression-based subtype of GBM cells, we first calculated z-scores for gene expression 
data across samples, and then applied ssGSEA (version gsea2–2.2.1) on the normalized 
expression profile. For each cell, we ranked all genes based on their expression values to 
create a .rnk file as the input of the software GseaPreranked. An enrichment score was 
computed for all four subtypes initially defined in Verhaak et al32. The subtype with the 
maximal enrichment score was used as the representative subtype for each cell.
Topological data analysis using Single cell transcriptome
We filtered out normal cells based on their expression profile. To that end, we considered 
expression signatures of normal oligodendrocytes, neurons, and astrocytes 45, microglia 46, 
endothelial cells 47, T-cells 48, and other immune cells 48,49, and used a Gaussian mixture 
model to classify individual cells according to their expression profile. 94/133, 82/85 and 
90/137 cells, respectively for GBM9, GBM10, and GBM2, were classified as tumor cells. 
After normalization of gene expression level by dividing total number of reads in each cell 
to eliminate the potential bias caused by batch effect, we built topological representations of 
these single cell data using Mapper algorithm 23, as implemented by Ayasdi Inc. Open-
source implementations of this algorithm are also available (http://danifold.net/mapper, 
http://github.com/MLWave/kepler-mapper). We used the first two components of 
multidimensional scaling (MDS) as auxiliary functions for the algorithm. The output of 
Mapper is a low-dimensional network representations of the data, where nodes represent sets 
of cells with similar global transcriptional profiles (as measured by the correlation of the 
expression levels of the 2,000 genes with highest variance across each patient). We identified 
individual genes that had an expression pattern localized in the network, and used those to 
determine the sub-clonal structure of the samples at the level of expression.
PDC-based chemical screening and analysis
PDCs grown in serum-free medium were seeded in 384-well plates at a density of 500 cells 
per well in duplicate or triplicate for each treatment. The drug panel consisted of 40 
anticancer agents (Selleckchem) targeting oncogenic signals. Two hours after the plating, 
PDCs were treated with drugs in a fourfold and seven-point serial dilution series from 20 
μM to 4.88 nM using Janus Automated Workstation (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). 
After 6 days of incubation at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator, cell viability was 
analyzed using an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) monitoring system based on firefly 
luciferase (ATPLite™ 1step, PerkinElmer). Viable cells were estimated using EnVision 
Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer). Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was also included as control 
in each plate. Controls were used for calculation of relative cell viability for each plate and 
normalization per-plate basis. DRC fitting was performed using GraphPad Prism 5 
(GraphPad) and evaluated by measuring Area Under the Curve (AUC) of dose response 
curve. After normalization, best-fit lines were determined and the AUC value of each curve 
was calculated using GraphPad Prism, ignoring regions defined by fewer than two peaks.
Cell viability was determined via calculating AUC values of dose–response curves (DRCs) 
with exclusion of non-convergent fits50.

 Moduli space analysis
To illustrate evolution histories of GBM patients, we applied moduli space analysis51 in 
local and multiple group of patients. Multiregion pairs were compared to calculate number 
of shared and private mutations. In this analysis, clonal mutations were separated based on 
their allele frequencies. Sector pairs were put in left sphere based on the number of shared 
and private mutations with high allele frequency mutations (>20%), while the same number 
of pairs were put in right sphere based on mutations with low allele frequency mutations 
(<20%). The same analysis was then also performed based on inferred clonally.
Immunohistochemistry
Tissue specimens were fixed by formalin and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin-embedded 
sections were treated with 0.3% Hydorgen peroxide to block endogenous peroxidase acitivty 
and antigens were retrieved by heating sections in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0) for 95 
degree Celsius 30 min. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 
degree Celsius, biotinylated secondary antibodies for 1 hr in RT and avidin-biotin complex 
for 1 hr in RT.
Western blot
GBM PDCs were washed with cold PBS, harvested in lysis buffer (150 mM sodium 
chloride, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCL and 2 
mM EDTA), and a protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail added (Thermo Scientific). 
Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 15 min, 4°C. The 
proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed using antibodies 
against indicated proteins.
Limiting dilution assay
GBM PDCs were dissociated into single-cell suspensions and then plated into 96-well plates 
at 1–250 cells per well. Cells were incubated at 37°C for one to two weeks. At the time of 
quantification, each well was examined for formation of neurosphere-like cell aggregates. 
Statistical significance was evaluated using Extreme Limiting Dilution Analysis (ELDA; 
Walter+Eliza Hall Bioinformatics).
Gene fusion validation
Validation of gene fusion transcripts were performed by reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Total RNA was extracted from the tissues by AllPrep 
DNA/RNA Mini kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). Total RNA (1 
μg) was reverse transcribed to synthesize template cDNA by a random primer using the 
SuperScriptIII First-Strand System(Life Technologies), and 20 μl of synthesized cDNA was 
diluted 5 fold with DW. For RT-PCR, EzWay Taq PCR MasterMix (Komabiotech, KOREA) 
and 5 μl of synthesized cDNA template was used. Thermal cycling was carried out under the 
following conditions: 1 min at 95°C followed by 30 cycles of 30 sec at 95°C, 30 sec at 56°C, 
30 sec at 72°C. The primer pairs used in this experiment were designed to make the 
amplification product including the breakpoints of the fusion genes. PCR products were

 Figure 1. Mutational landscape of multi-region malignant glioma samples
(a) A schematic representation of glioma genomic heterogeneity and differential drug 
response analysis. Human glioma specimens were acquired based on their spatial order, or 
longitudinal pairs and subjected for genomic analysis for identification of tumor-initiating 
(truncal) events. (b) Somatic mutations including Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) and 
small Insertions/Deletions, copy number alterations, and gene fusions of 83 glioma multi-
region or multisector-longitudinal specimens from 30 patients are demonstrated. 34 locally 
adjacent tumor fragments were from 14 patients, 13 multifocal/multicentric (referred as 
multiple) tissues from 5 patients, and a longitudinal pair GBM14 with leptomeningeal 
seeding were collected from Samsung Medical Center (SMC). We also curated 34 
multisector-longitudinal tumor exomes and/or RNA sequencing from 10 patients in TCGA 
cohort8. All somatic mutations called by SAVI with allele frequency >5% were 
demonstrated. For each gene we calculated the copy number (CN) based on Excavator. 
Clonal alterations were determined using ABSOLUTE with cancer cell fraction >80%.

 Figure 2. Comparison of genetic heterogeneity across glioma multisector / longitudinal samples
Patient samples were classified into five groups: Local, Multiple Lesion, S.T. (Short-Term) 
Longitudinal Local, L.T. (Long-Term) Longitudinal Local and Longitudinal Distant for 
comparative analyses. (a) Nei’s genetic distance of the indicated groups are shown. Q-values 
were calculated by Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test and corrected for false discovery rate using 
Benjamini-Hochberg method. S.T. and L.T. Local indicates short-time (<18 months surgical 
interval) and long-time recurrent tumors ( ≥18 months), respectively. (b) Illustration of 
leave-one-out results from multinomial logistic regression. Each point indicates one pair of 
samples, and their coordinates are the probabilities to be local, multiple lesion/longitudinal 
distant, or longitudinal local. Long-Time recurrent samples were classified together with 
multiple lesion/longitudinal distant samples, indicating they might follow the same 
evolutionary model. (c) Tumor evolution behind Big Bang and Multiverse models. The Big 
Bang model is indicated as a mixture of tumor cells that share many clonal and subclonal 
alterations. The Multiverse model is indicated with a greater proportion of private events at a 
clonal level. (d) Pie charts demonstrate the frequencies of PIK3CA mutations in multifocal/
multicentric (M-) GBMs (30%, 9/30) and solitary (S-) GBMs (10%, 13/130). The p-value 
was calculated using Fisher’s exact test.

 Fig. 3. Single cell transcriptome from multi-region samples
(a) Expression profile of individual tumor cells from three samples of GBM9 (left initial, 
right initial, and relapse), according to expression subtypes32. For each cell, the subtype with 
the highest expression is marked with an asterisk. Several EGFR genomic alterations can be 
identified in the single cell expression data (yellow), despite the abundance of missing data 
(gray). (b) Topological representation of the expression data of individual tumor cells from 
GBM9, labeled by sample of origin. Each node represents a set of cells with similar 
transcriptional profile. A cell can appear in several nodes, and two nodes are connected by 
an edge if they have at least one cell in common. Topological representation of GBM9 
labeled by expression of EGFR (c) and mitotic genes (d). (e) Expression profile of 
individual tumor cells from GBM10 (two samples: 5-ALA (+) and 5-ALA (-)). The p-value 
between proneural and 5-ALA was obtained using Fisher’s exact test. The p-value between 
mesenchymal and LTBP4 expression was calculated based on Spearman’s correlation. 
ATRX fusion was validated by RT-PCR assays (Supplementary Fig. 7b–c). Topological 
representation of expression data of individual tumor cells from patients GBM10 (f) and 
GBM2 (g), labeled by the sample of origin. (h) Expression profile of individual tumor cells

 Fig 4. Chemical screening of multi-region patient-derived cells (PDCs)
(a) PDCs were treated with 40 chemical agents, targeting oncogenic signaling pathways in 
diluted series from 20 μM to 4.88 nM. X-axis indicates Nei’s genetic distances between 
fragments from the same patient, while y-axis indicates Spearman’s correlation coefficient 
(SCC) of corresponding fragments based on drug sensitivities measured by Area Under the 
Curve (AUC). (b) A violin plot for SCC of drug responses of the groups described in Fig. 
4a. (c) Mean values of AUCs for six PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) inhibitors (BEZ235, 
BKM120, BYL719, AZD5363, AZD2014 and Everolimus) of PDCs isolated from M- (n=9) 
or S-GBMs (n=22) were plotted. (d) The normalized Z-score in each PDC was plotted when 
the corresponding tissues harbored associated genetic alterations, designated as “shared” or 
“private”. The private group was determined when the drug response-associated genetic 
alteration (i.e. EGFR mutations-EGFR inhibitors; PTEN mutations-PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
pathway inhibitors) was private, and vice versa for the shared group. (e) Preoperative T1-
weighted contrast-enhanced MR image and key genomic alterations found in the 
corresponding tumors and its derivative cells from a multicentric patient (GBM9). Right-side 
‘R’ tumors encompassed the right frontal lobes and corpus callosum (CC). ‘L’ indicates the 
left frontal tumor. Preoperative MRI showed a multifocal infiltrative lesion in both the 
frontal lobe and CC. (f) Scatterplot of AUC for 40 cancer-targeting compounds on GBM9 
PDCs derived from the left and right side tumor. The R was obtained as Pearson’s 
correlation coefficient. All p-values in this figure were obtained using Wilcoxson Rank-Sum 
test.
