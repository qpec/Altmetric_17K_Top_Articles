Abstract
Introduction
Health locus of control refers to the belief that health is in one’s
control (internal control) or is not in one’s control (external con-
trol). Among adults, external locus of control is associated with
negative health outcomes, whereas internal locus of control is as-
sociated with favorable outcomes. Few studies examined these as-
sociations among youths. The objective of our study was to de-
termine how locus of control relates to health care use, medication
adherence, missed school, and readiness for transition to adult
medical care for youths with chronic conditions.
Methods
Participants at a camp for youths aged 6 to 17 years with chronic
health conditions completed a survey measuring locus of control,
readiness for transition to adult care, and medication adherence.
Their parents completed a separate part of the survey about health
care use and missed school days in the past year.
Results
A total of 163 youths completed the survey (78.5% white; 52.1%
female; mean age, 12.3 y).  Internal locus of control (β = 0.196; P
= .013) and external Doctor locus of control with doctors con-
trolling disease (β = 0.181; P = .025) were positively associated
with transition readiness. External control by chance or with oth-
ers controlling disease was negatively associated with transition
readiness (β = −0.248; P = .002) and positively associated with
emergency department visits (β = 0.225; P = .004) and with num-
ber of hospital inpatient nights at hospital (β = 0.166; P = .04).
Conclusion
Adolescents with external control of their health by chance or by
other people are at increased risk for negative health outcomes and
may fail to develop the self-management skills needed for success-
ful transitioning to adult care. Future studies should examine ef-
fects of changes in locus of control on health outcomes among
youths.
Introduction
Health locus of control (LOC) reflects people’s beliefs about who
or what is responsible for management of their health condition
(1). LOC may influence a person’s health behaviors and can there-
fore influence health outcomes. In adults, internal LOC (the belief
that a person can control his or her health condition and that
health-related outcomes are contingent on a person’s behaviors
and actions) has been associated with positive health outcomes
such as reduced use of emergency departments (EDs) (2) and re-
duced disease burden and increased self-rated health (3), adher-
ence to treatment (4), and general health (5). Internal LOC may
similarly affect youths with chronic conditions, but studies are
lacking. Conversely, external LOC indicates that a person be-

 lieves that outside factors such as doctors, other people, or chance
determine health outcomes. In the adult population, external LOC
has been associated with negative outcomes, such as decreased
quality of life (6), increased ED visits (2), and decreased accept-
ance of illness (7). A 1985 study found that many children had a
strong external LOC and felt that their doctor rather than they
themselves were in control of their health condition. This belief
was linked to a reduction in independent health decision-making
(8), but no data are available suggesting how external LOC affects
disease outcomes among youths. Youths with high external LOC
may be at a particular risk for negative health outcomes because of
dependence on others (eg, doctors, parents, another responsible
adult) to manage their condition or because of the belief that
chance controls progression of their disease. These 2 factors may
hinder learning important self-management skills to prepare for
transition to adult health care (9).
Understanding how LOC is associated with outcomes in this popu-
lation may provide a basis for interventions aimed at changing
young patients’ LOC. Health LOC has been a target for interven-
tions in several adult populations, such as women with post-
partum depression (10) and people with chronic pain (11). Given
the evidence that LOC can be changed and the potential of such
interventions to improve health outcomes, the baseline association
of LOC and health outcomes among youths should be examined.
Despite the numerous health outcomes associated with LOC
among adults, few outcomes have been studied in youths with
chronic conditions. The aim of our study was to examine the rela-
tionship between LOC and transition readiness, self-management,
medication adherence, health care use, and missed school days
among youths with chronic conditions. We hypothesized that, as
with adults, internal LOC would be associated with improved
health outcomes and transition readiness and external LOC would
be associated with poor health outcomes and transition readiness.
Methods
Our study population consisted of youths aged 6 to 17 years  who
attended Victory Junction Camp in Randleman, North Carolina,
during the summer of 2015. Victory Junction is a therapeutic camp
that serves youths in this age group with at least one chronic con-
dition such as cancer, sickle cell disease, spina bifida, chronic kid-
ney disease, or diabetes. Most participants came from the south-
eastern United States. Before the start of camp, we sent an invita-
tion to participate in our study and a link to the online consent
forms and survey via email to the parents of each camper. All
questionnaires were administered by using the web-based Qual-
trics survey software (Qualtrics LLC). Parents gave informed con-
sent and youths gave assent within the Qualtrics platform before
they completed the surveys. To be included in the study, both the
camper and a parent had to complete their respective portions of
the survey. We excluded families in which only a parent or only
the child provided data. Parents were asked to report their child’s
number of missed school days, ED visits, hospitalizations, and
number of inpatient nights spent in the hospital during the past
year. Parents provided camper age, sex, race, and insurance status.
The study was approved by the institutional review board of the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
The Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLC)
Form C is an 18-item validated questionnaire that assesses a pa-
tient’s LOC (12). One subscale of the MHLC is for internal LOC
(patients have control over their own health) and 3 are for external
LOC (Doctors external, Chance external, and Others external [eg,
parents, other responsible adult control health]). The MHLC con-
sists of statements that the camper is asked to agree or disagree
with on a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 being “strongly disagree”
and 5 being “strongly agree.” The total score for each subscale
was calculated by summing the points associated with responses
within each subscale. Statements include, for example, “If my con-
dition worsens, it is my own behavior which determines how soon
I will feel better again” and “As to my condition, what will be will
be.”
We used the University of North Carolina STARx scale (Self-
Management and Transition from Pediatric to Adult-Focused
Health Care with Rx/Treatment scale) as a measure of transition
readiness (13,14). This 18-item validated questionnaire was used
to collect self-reported transition readiness scores from patients.
Six subdomains were defined: communication with physician, en-
gagement during appointments, medication management, disease
knowledge, health responsibilities, and resource use. All items
were measured on a 5-point Likert scale with the overall scale
score as a sum of the point value associated with each response,
for a total score ranging from 0 to 90. Examples of questions in-
cluded were “How often did you make an effort to understand
what your doctor told you?” and “How often did you take your
medicines on your own?”
The 4-item Morisky Medication Adherence (MMA) scale (15)
was used to determine medication adherence. Questions were
answered in a yes or no format. The number of “no” answers was
summed to create a total score of 1 to 4 with 0 indicating low ad-
herence and higher scores indicating increased adherence. Ex-
amples of questions were “Do you forget to take your medicine?”
and “Are you careless at times about taking your medicine?”

 All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Version 23 (IBM
Corp). Descriptive statistics were used to determine average scale
scores and sample characteristics. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used
to determine normality of the variables, and variables that were
non-normal were transformed by using base-10 logs. Linear re-
gressions were used with domains of the MHLC as independent
variables, and age, sex, race, and insurance type were used as con-
trol variables. Separate analyses were run for the following 6 de-
pendent variables: transition readiness (using STARx), adherence
(using MMA), ED visits, hospitalizations, length of hospital stay,
and missed school days. Additionally, we examined the relation-
ship between number of daily medications or weekly injections
and LOC.
Results
We enrolled 163 parent–camper pairs in this study. Surveys were
sent  to  all  families  with  email  access,  for  a  total  of  903
parent–camper pairs; 260 parents and 176 campers completed sur-
veys. Only those campers whose parents also completed their sur-
veys were included in the sample. The sample was predominantly
white (78.5%), and 65% of youths were privately insured. Boys
(47.9%) and girls (52.1%) were approximately equally represen-
ted, and youths reported various chronic medical conditions with
diabetes (19%) being the most common (Table 1).
The mean number of daily medications was 2.48 (standard devi-
ation [SD], 2.72). The mean number of weekly injections was 0.93
(SD, 2.03). An average of one ED visit (SD, 2.0), less than 1 hos-
pital admission (SD, 1.2),  4.3 inpatient nights in the hospital (SD,
9.9), and 11 school absences (SD, 17.6) were reported by parents
for the past year. The average transition scale score was 61.9 (SD,
12.9). These variables were nonnormally distributed, and all had
positive skewness greater than 2. The data were transformed by
using base-10 logs, and after transformation, skewness was within
the normal limit (<2). Medication adherence (mean, 2.33; SD,
0.57) was normally distributed and not transformed.
Linear regressions were used to test our hypotheses that LOC is
associated with health care use, medication adherence, and trans-
ition scores (Table 2). The models predicting medication adher-
ence (F8,162 = 1.307, P = 0.25, R2 = .07), and missed school (F8,162
= 1.490, P = .17, R2 = .07), were not significant. The model with
transition readiness scores as the dependent variables was signific-
ant (F8,162 = 2.944, P = .004; R2 = 0.133). In that model, internal
LOC (β = 0.196, P = .01) and Doctors external LOC (β = 0.181, P
= .03) and others external LOC (β = −0.248, P = .002) were asso-
ciated with transition scores. ED visits (F8,162 = 2.305, P = .02, R2
= 0.107) were positively associated with Chance external LOC (β
= 0.225, P = .004). The number of inpatient nights spent in the
hospital (F8,162 = 3.162, P = .002, R2 = 0.141) were associated with
an Others external LOC (β = 0.166, P = .04). Hospital admissions
were not significantly associated with LOC.
Daily medications were regressed onto each LOC domain and
were not significant in any of the domains. When weekly injec-
tions were regressed with the LOC domains, significance was
found between injections and internal LOC (β = 0.641, P = .005)
and between injections and Doctors external LOC (β = 0.214, P =
.046).
Discussion
This study examined the relationship between LOC and various
health outcomes among youths with chronic diseases. A stronger
internal LOC or Doctors external LOC corresponded with im-
proved transition readiness, whereas an external others LOC or ex-
ternal chance LOC was associated with decreased transition readi-
ness. This finding suggests that youths who feel they can control
the outcome of their disease and do not let their disease course de-
pend on people other than their physician are more likely to learn
self-management skills needed for transitioning to adult care. The
positive association between Doctors external LOC and increased
transition readiness probably indicates that people trust their phys-
ician to act in their best interest and thus adhere more strongly to
disease management tasks recommended by their physician. Addi-
tionally, an increased Chance external LOC was associated with
increased ED visits in the past year, whereas an increased Others
external LOC was associated with an increase in the number of in-
patient nights spent in the hospital. This suggests that youths who
believe that other people or chance have a greater effect on their
disease progression than they themselves do are more likely to use
additional health services than youths with a lower external LOC.
Why we did not observe a significant effect of LOC on school ab-
sences or medication adherence is not clear. Other factors may
provide a more powerful explanation. For example, parents rather
than children will determine if the child stays home from school.
Additionally, a large number of youths (28.9%) in our sample did
not use medications for their condition. When we limited our ana-
lysis to only those participants who did use medication, LOC still
was not associated with adherence (F8,112 = 1.145, P = .34, R2 =
0.081). Parents play a key role in their child’s medication adher-
ence (16,17), which may explain why the child’s LOC did not in-
fluence adherence. More studies are needed to test the association
between LOC and adherence among youths.

 Although  daily  medications  were  not  associated  with  LOC,
weekly injections were. This may be due to the wide variation of
conditions and disease severity present in our sample. Our find-
ings demonstrated a positive association between the number of
weekly injections and an internal and Doctors external LOC, that
is, the more injections a patient performed per week, the greater
their internal and Doctors external LOC. In our analyses conduc-
ted for this study, we found that an increase in both of these LOC
domains were related to improved transition readiness. Because a
greater proportion of the youths who completed surveys had dia-
betes, this relationship between LOC and injections may suggest
these youths have stronger internal and Doctors external LOCs,
and thus may be more prepared to transition to adult care. This
finding may also suggest that patients who regularly have injec-
tions may have more opportunities to take their care into their own
hands by learning self-injection and are then able to observe the
positive outcomes that come with regular injections. Conversely,
patients with a higher internal or Doctors external LOC may be
more likely to perform their recommended daily injections. This
relationship should be explored in future studies.
Health LOC was not previously studied in youths with chronic
diseases or in relation to the range of health outcomes that we ex-
plored. As among the adult population, a stronger internal LOC
was linked to improved outcomes (2–5), whereas stronger extern-
al LOCs were related to poor outcomes, such as more hospitaliza-
tions. As with adults, an increased external LOC among youths
was linked to increased use of EDs (2). Thus, LOC may have sim-
ilar effects in youths and adults. The effect of parents as an LOC
on outcomes among youths needs to be studied.
This study had several limitations. First, all measurements were
collected at the same time and no causality can be determined
from the study. We could not determine if LOC influences out-
comes or if outcomes influence LOC. Second, health care use and
school absences were collected by retrospective self-report for the
past year. Issues with recall may bias these measurements. There-
fore, future studies should include more objective measurements
extracted from medical and school records. Third, the sample, al-
though fairly sizeable and varied in medical diagnoses, was largely
homogeneous in race and socioeconomic class. Most participants
were white and privately insured. Studies with more diversity in
race and socioeconomic status are needed. Finally, although Vic-
tory Junction campers come from throughout the country, most
campers were from the southeastern United States. A broader
sample could explore whether geographic location within the
United States is associated with LOC or with the health outcomes
we studied.
This is the first study of youths with chronic disorders showing the
importance of LOC in predicting health outcomes and transition
readiness. A stronger internal LOC was associated with improved
outcomes, and a stronger external LOC was linked to poorer out-
comes. Health care providers can use LOC to identify patients
who are at risk for negative outcomes so that steps can be taken to
improve outcomes. Evidence suggests that LOC can be a target for
intervention. For example, in a sample of adult patients with
chronic pain, internal health LOC was increased after the imple-
mentation of a pain management program (11), indicating that
with increased opportunities to learn about disease management,
patients may feel more empowered and in control of their condi-
tion. Youths’ health beliefs are not yet fully formed; therefore,
they may be more receptive to an intervention that aims to modify
LOC. An increase in youths’ internal LOC may correspond with
improved health behaviors. Ultimately, this shift in beliefs may
significantly improve health outcomes, and adaptation of an inter-
vention targeting LOC for youths may be an important next step.

a A 1-unit increase in LOC predicts a change of B units in the outcome (dependent variable). Unstandardized regression coefficients in the same model cannot be
directly compared.
b For a 1-standard deviation change in LOC domain, the standard deviation of the outcome changes by β units. Standardized regression coefficients in the same
model can be compared with higher values indicative of larger associations between LOC domain and outcome.
c Race, sex, age, and insurance coverage were controlled for in each model.
