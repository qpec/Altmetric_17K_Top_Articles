S
troke is a leading cause of long-term disability.1 Although 
an estimated 80% of patients survive for 1 year after 
stroke, >70% have enduring disabilities.2 There are no proven 
medical or surgical neurorestorative treatments for chronic 
stroke; however, the regenerative effects of different cell types 
and various routes of delivery are being investigated as poten-
tial treatment.3,4 To date, pilot clinical trials have reported 
an acceptable safety profile with some functional benefits 
to patients with stroke using transplanted neuronal cells dif-
ferentiated from a teratocarcinoma cell line,5 human imma-
ture neural and hematopoietic cells,6 autologous human bone 
marrow–derived mononuclear cells, and mesenchymal stem 
cells.3,7 The cells used in these pilot clinical trials were admin-
istered to patients by intracerebral, intra-arterial, intravenous, 
or intracerebroventricular routes during the period of days to 
years after stroke.3,7
Background and Purpose—Preclinical data suggest that cell-based therapies have the potential to improve stroke outcomes.
Methods—Eighteen patients with stable, chronic stroke were enrolled in a 2-year, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate 
the safety and clinical outcomes of surgical transplantation of modified bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells 
(SB623).
Results—All patients in the safety population (N=18) experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event. Six patients 
experienced 6 serious treatment-emergent adverse events; 2 were probably or definitely related to surgical procedure; 
none were related to cell treatment. All serious treatment-emergent adverse events resolved without sequelae. There were 
no dose-limiting toxicities or deaths. Sixteen patients completed 12 months of follow-up at the time of this analysis. 
Significant improvement from baseline (mean) was reported for: (1) European Stroke Scale: mean increase 6.88 (95% 
confidence interval, 3.5–10.3; P<0.001), (2) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale: mean decrease 2.00 (95% 
confidence interval, −2.7 to −1.3; P<0.001), (3) Fugl-Meyer total score: mean increase 19.20 (95% confidence interval, 
11.4–27.0; P<0.001), and (4) Fugl-Meyer motor function total score: mean increase 11.40 (95% confidence interval, 4.6–
18.2; P<0.001). No changes were observed in modified Rankin Scale. The area of magnetic resonance T2 fluid-attenuated 
inversion recovery signal change in the ipsilateral cortex 1 week after implantation significantly correlated with clinical 
improvement at 12 months (P<0.001 for European Stroke Scale).
Conclusions—In this interim report, SB623 cells were safe and associated with improvement in clinical outcome end points 
at 12 months.

 1818  Stroke  July 2016
Interim data from the PISCES Phase 1 trial for chronic 
stroke showed that intracerebral implantation of modified 
human neural stem cells was safe and seemed to be associated 
with improvements of neurological function in some of the 
stroke scales; these data were considered sufficient to warrant 
initiating a Phase 2 trial (PISCES II).8 In addition, a Phase 2 
trial for subacute stroke reported that intravenous infusion of 
bone marrow–derived mononuclear cells was safe but had no 
effect on measures of neurological function.9
A recent meta-analysis of preclinical studies showed that 
mesenchymal stem cells used to treat ischemic stroke were 
associated with improvements of neurological function and 
that the intracerebral route was associated with the greatest 
improvement.10 A Cochrane Database review of the safety and 
efficacy of transplanted stem cells in patients with ischemic 
stroke identified a single small randomized clinical trial which 
reported no cell-related adverse events (AEs) associated with 
nonstatistically significant improvements in patients after lon-
ger follow-up.11
The stereotactic implantation of modified bone marrow–
derived mesenchymal stem cells (SB623) transiently trans-
fected with the human Notch-1 intracellular domain is an 
additional option.12 Preclinical studies using a model of 
chronic ischemic stroke in which rodent and human SB623 
cells were stereotactically implanted into the striatum of the 
rat showed improvements in locomotor and neurological func-
tion that were associated with a reduction in peri-infarct cell 
loss.13 Other preclinical studies have reported that SB623 cells 
are associated with the promotion of neuronal stem cell migra-
tion and differentiation and production of extracellular matrix 
factors that provide trophic support for damaged cells.14,15
This report presents preliminary 12-month interim data 
from a 2-year, open-label, single-arm study (NCT01287936) 
that was designed to evaluate the safety and clinical outcomes 
of the stereotactic placement of SB623 cells at the margin of 
the stroke in patients with chronic motor deficits >6 months 
after their initial stroke.
Methods
Patients
We screened 379 patients and enrolled 18 patients (mean age of 61 
years; 61% female; Table 1) with chronic motor deficits between 6 
and 60 months after sustaining a nonhemorrhagic stroke. Patients 
had stable chronic stroke at baseline as assessed by 2 evaluations 
conducted within 3 weeks before enrollment in which there was no 
change in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 
of greater than ±1 point (inclusion criteria listed in Table I in the 
online-only Data Supplement).5,16 Patients did not receive poststroke 
rehabilitation services during the study. This study was conducted at 
2 sites in the United States (Stanford University School of Medicine/
Stanford Healthcare and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center), 
with patients being enrolled between September 2011 and August 
2013. Clinical study protocols were reviewed and approved by insti-
tutional review boards, and patients provided written informed con-
sent. Study inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table I in the 
online-only Data Supplement.
The intent-to-treat population (n=18) that was used for the clini-
cal evaluation included all patients enrolled in the study; at the time 
of this interim analysis, 16 subjects had 12-month data (2 patients 
had withdrawn, both were lost to follow-up [last contact with patients 
being at the month 3 and month 6 visits, respectively, with the second 
patient declining her year 1 and year 2 visits because she had moved 
to Taiwan]). The safety population consisted of 18 patients who 
enrolled in the study, received cell treatment, and had postbaseline 
data. Patients enrolled in the study were assessed for acute and long-
term outcomes using the following measures: (1) European Stroke 
Scale (ESS, the primary outcome end point was ESS at 6 months),17 
(2) NIHSS,18,19 (3) modified Rankin Scale (mRS),20,21 and (4) Fugl-
Meyer (F-M) score.22–24 ESS, NIHSS, and mRS evaluations were 
conducted by neurologists, whereas F-M scores were evaluated by 
physical therapists at the 2 sites. The neurologists were not blinded to 
SB623 cell dose (they had access to all records) but stated that they 
were not aware of the dose delivered when conducting evaluations. 
The study visit schedule is listed in the Methods section in the online-
only Data Supplement.
SB623 Cells
SB623 cells are modified bone marrow–derived mesenchymal 
stem cells that were developed as an allogeneic cell therapy for 
chronic motor deficit because of stable stroke. SB623 cells are 
generated under good manufacturing practices by transient trans-
fection with a plasmid containing the human Notch-1 intracellular 
domain.12 The transfection is considered to be transient because 
expansion and passaging of the cells result in the rapid loss of the 
transfected plasmid. Using an intracerebral xenograft in stroke and 
nonstroke rodent models, the SB623 cells only survive 1 month 
post implantation.13,25
Study Design, Dosing, and Administration
Patients were divided into 3 cohorts of 6 patients. The 3 cohorts 
received single doses of 2.5×106, 5.0×106, or 10×106 SB623 cells. 
The SB623 cells were implanted using magnetic resonance imag-
ing stereotactic technique to define the target sites surrounding the 
residual stroke volume. At baseline, the mean poststroke interval 
was 22 months and mean stroke volume was 42 cm3. Using a single 
burr-hole craniostomy and 3 cannula tracks, five 20 µL cell deposits 
were made at 5 to 6 mm intervals along each track in the peri-infarct 
area. The concentration of cells ranged from 8000 to 33 000 SB623 
cells per microliter. Cells were deposited at a rate not exceeding 
10 µL per minute, equating to ≈15 minutes for each needle track. 
A 0.9-mm outer diameter stereotactic cannula was used for cell 
injection.5,16
Safety
A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) was defined as any event not 
present before the initiation of treatment or any event already pres-
ent that worsened in either intensity or frequency after exposure to 
study treatment. All AEs were reported according to standard pro-
cedures and were classified by investigators as being: (1) mild, (2) 
moderate, (3) severe, or (4) life threatening. The parameters used by 
investigators to evaluate the relationship of the AE to the cell treat-
ment or study procedure are listed in Table II in the online-only Data 
Supplement.
Statistics
Descriptive statistics were calculated for continuous variables that 
included patient number, mean, SD, SEM (95% confidence interval 
[CI]=±1.96×SEM), median, minimum, maximum, and 95% CIs. 
Descriptive statistics were calculated for categorical variables, which 
included the number and percentage of patients in each category. For 
prospectively specified end points, Wilcoxon signed-rank test was 
used to evaluate significance of change versus baseline for clinical 
outcomes, with P<0.05 considered to be statistically significant. In 
post hoc analyses, Pearson correlations were used to evaluate the 
associations between: (1) area of transient postimplantation magnetic 
resonance (MR) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal 
intensity changes and clinical outcomes and (2) number of contrast-
enhancing areas and changes in clinical outcomes. P<0.05 was con-
sidered to be statistically significant. Data analyses were performed 
using Statistical Analysis System (SAS) version 9.2 (Cary, NC).

Results
Safety Evaluations
In this analysis, all patients experienced at least 1 TEAE in 
the 12 months after implantation of SB623 cells (Table 2). 
The most frequently reported TEAEs (percent of patients) 
in the pooled dose assessment of SB623 cells were head-
ache related to surgical procedure (77.8%), nausea (33.3%), 
vomiting (22.2%), depression (22.2%), muscle spasticity 
(22.2%), fatigue (16.7%), blood glucose increase (16.7%), 
and C-reactive protein increase (16.7%; Table 2). There 
was no relation between cell dose levels and frequency of 
TEAEs.
In the safety population (N=18), patients experienced a total 
of 28 treatment-related TEAEs during 12 months of follow-up. 
In total, 88.9% of patients (16 TEAEs in 18 patients) experi-
enced a TEAE that investigators evaluated as being unrelated to 
cell treatment (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement). 
In comparison, 44.4% (8 TEAEs in 18 patients) experienced 
a TEAE that was unlikely to be related to the cells and 22.2% 
(4 TEAEs in 18 patients) experienced a TEAE that was possi-
bly related (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement). No 
patients experienced a TEAE that was probably or definitely 
related to cell treatment. The 4 TEAEs (22.2%) that were pos-
sibly related to the cells were muscle spasticity (2), gait distur-
bance (1), and procedural headache (1).
More patients possibly, probably, or definitely experienced 
TEAEs related to the surgical procedure than to the cells 
(Table III in the online-only Data Supplement). Postsurgery 
headache was the most common TEAE that was probably or 
definitely related to the procedure, experienced by 77.8% (14 
in 18 patients) of patients (Table III in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
There were 6 serious TEAEs experienced by 6 patients, 
with no clear trends regarding serious TEAEs and cell dos-
age (Table 3). Serious TEAEs were unrelated or unlikely to 
be related to cell treatment; however, a single patient devel-
oped an asymptomatic subdural fluid collection that was defi-
nitely related to the procedure and was managed by burr-hole 
drainage. An additional patient had a seizure on study day 70, 
which the investigator evaluated as life threatening and prob-
ably related to the surgical procedure. A patient underwent 
stenting for an asymptomatic cervical carotid artery steno-
sis on study day 291; the investigator evaluated the event as 
being unrelated to both cell treatment and surgical procedure. 
A patient experienced a transient ischemic attack on study 
day 334 that was associated with worsening facial droop and 
slurred speech. Although the transient ischemic attack was 
assessed as being in the same brain area as the original stroke 
and SB623 cell delivery, it occurred 11 months after surgery 
and was evaluated by the investigator as being unrelated to 
both cell treatment and surgical procedure. All serious TEAEs 
received supportive therapy and were evaluated as being 
recovered or resolved without sequelae (Table 3).
We found no clinically meaningful changes in hematology 
parameters, biochemistry parameters, lipids, cytokines (tumor 
necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interferon-γ), or vital 
signs during this 12-month analysis. In addition, no antibody-
related sensitization to SB623 cells was observed.
Clinical Outcome Evaluations
Clinical outcome analyses were conducted on 16 patients who 
had completed 12 months of treatment in the intent-to-treat 
population (n=18). The baseline mean (SD) ESS total score 
was 58.44 (6.27). The mean ESS total score increased sig-
nificantly from baseline by 6.50 (95% CI, 2.6–10.4; P<0.01) 
at 6 months (the primary outcome) and 6.88 (95% CI, 3.5–
10.3; P<0.001) at 12 months and was increased significantly 
from baseline at all other time points, starting at 1 month 
(Figure 1A).
Significant improvements from baseline of the NIHSS 
total score was also observed at all time points starting with 1 
month. The baseline mean (SD) NIHSS total score was 9.44 
(1.89). The mean NIHSS total score decreased from baseline 
by 2.00 (95% CI, −2.7 to −1.3; P<0.001) at 12 months, repre-
senting a measurable improvement (Figure 1B).
The F-M total score and F-M motor function total score 
of the baseline means (SDs) were 133.61 (20.90) and 30.44

significantly from baseline by 19.20 (95% CI, 11.4–27.0; 
P<0.001) at 12 months (Figure 1C), and the mean F-M motor 
function total score increased significantly from baseline by 
11.40 (95% CI, 4.6–18.2; P<0.001) at 12 months (Figure 1D). 
Both F-M total score and F-M motor function total score 
were significantly increased from baseline at all time points 
(Figure 1C and 1D). From a baseline mean (SD) score of 3.22 
(0.43), no change was seen in mRS at 12 months (0.00; 95% 
CI, −0.2 to 0.2; P=1.0000). Correlation of improvements of 
clinical outcome end points with cell dose levels did not show 
any clear dose–response relationships. There was no associa-
tion between improvement in clinical outcome measures and 
either baseline stroke severity or baseline patient age.

 Steinberg et al  Transplanted SB623 Cells for Chronic Stroke   1821
MR Findings
Thirteen of the 18 patients in the trial demonstrated new signal 
changes on MR T2 FLAIR imaging (0.5–9.2 cm2; 0.6–3.5 cm 
maximum diameter) primarily in or adjacent to the premotor 
cortex along the cannula track at 1 week post-transplantation 
(except 1 patient without a week 1 MR who showed a new 
FLAIR signal at 2 weeks). These FLAIR signal changes were 
diffusion-weighted image negative, were not present on the day 
1 post-transplant MR scan, and were found to have resolved 
on the month 1 or 2 post-transplant MR scan (Figure 2). There 
were significant Pearson correlations between the size of the 
initial post-transplant FLAIR signal changes and neurological 
recovery as measured by change from baseline in clinical out-
comes at 12 months (ESS total score: 0.818, P<0.001; NIHSS 
total score: −0.688, P<0.01; F-M total score: 0.708, P<0.01; 
F-M motor function total score: 0.668, P<0.01).
We also examined the relationship between FLAIR signal 
changes and ≥10% change in the F-M motor function total 
score, a change that is accepted as a clinically meaningful 
improvement in chronic stroke.26–29 At 12 months, the posi-
tive predictive value of whether a FLAIR signal change 
would determine a clinically meaningful improvement was 
seen in 6 of 12 cases, whereas the negative predictive value 
(ie, the absence of a FLAIR signal change) of predicting a 
nonclinically meaningful improvement was seen in 3 of 4 
cases.
Contrast-enhancing areas in the cannula tract were 
observed at 1 week post-transplant in 15 patients (except 
1 patient without a week 1 MR who showed contrast 
enhancement at 2 weeks), 12 of whom had FLAIR signal 
changes. Such changes resolved with the same time course 
as the FLAIR signal abnormalities. There were signifi-
cant Pearson correlations between the number of contrast-
enhancing areas and change from baseline in measures 
of neurological recovery at 12 months (ESS total score: 
0.904, P<0.001; NIHSS total score: −0.643, P<0.05; F-M 
total score: 0.798, P<0.01; F-M motor function total score: 
0.728, P<0.01).

Discussion
Despite stroke representing a major cause of mortality and 
severe disability, the only proven therapies for ischemic stroke 
are intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator and intra-
arterial thrombectomy, both of which must be administered 
within a few hours of stroke onset.3,4,30,31 Currently, there are 
no proven medical or surgical neurorestorative treatments 
available for subacute or chronic stroke. However, stem cell 
and cultured cell therapy for chronic stroke is moving quickly 
into the clinical arena.3,6 For example, the stereotactic implan-
tation of cultured human neuronal cells into the brains of 
patients with stroke was investigated in Phase 1 and 2 studies 
which showed that although the surgical procedure and cell 
treatment were safe, there was no significant improvement in 
motor function, despite measureable improvements in some 
patients.5,16
Assessment of Potential Benefit
This is the first reported intracerebral stem cell transplant 
study for stroke in North America, in which stereotactic 
implantation of SB623 cells was generally safe and well toler-
ated by patients with most TEAEs being of moderate inten-
sity. No TEAEs were evaluated as being probably or definitely 
related to cell treatment; however, consistent with an earlier 
study that also used stereotactic intracranial administration of 
cells, many TEAEs were probably or definitely related to the 
surgical procedure.5 Of 6 serious AEs (all of which resolved 
without sequelae), 2 were probably or definitely related to the 
surgical procedure. Overall in this study, there were no clear 
dose responses to measures of safety.
The neurological deficits of patients with chronic stroke 
were assessed using standard impairment scales, specifically 
the ESS, NIHSS, and F-M scale. Despite these patients hav-
ing chronic stroke and stable neurological function scores at 
baseline, there were significant improvements in the mean 
scale scores of ESS, NIHSS, F-M total score, and F-M motor 
function total score at 12 months after treatment. The primary 
clinical outcome measure (significant improvement in ESS at 
6 months) was also positive.
The F-M motor function total score is well established 
as a reliable and valid method of assessing recovery from 
chronic stroke.24,32,33 A ≥10-point improvement (ie, ≥10% 
of the 100-point scale range) in the F-M motor function 
total score is accepted as a clinically meaningful change in 
chronic stroke.26–29 In this study, the mean F-M motor func-
tion total score increased from baseline by 11.4 points, rep-
resenting a clinically meaningful improvement at 12 months. 
Furthermore, a total of 7 patients experienced a ≥10-point 
change from baseline of the F-M motor function total score. 
For patients in the study, this represented a clinical improve-
ment in the power of upper and lower limbs, ranging from an 
improvement in the ability to stand to the disappearance of 
tremor.
The mRS has typically been applied to measure long-
term outcomes in global neurological function after acute 
stroke34; however, the value of the mRS to measure outcomes 
in patients with chronic stroke has not been established.35 In 
this study, patients did not experience a significant improve-
ment in mRS at 12 months or at any time point after treat-
ment. Considering these factors, it is not surprising that we 
were unable to detect significant change in the mRS during 12 
months. The most dramatic recovery in motor function after 
stroke is reported to occur in the first 30 days after stroke, 
with improvements in motor function reaching a plateau at 6 
months regardless of stroke severity.36–38 In addition, patients 
treated with cultured human neuronal cells in earlier clinical 
trials were also considered to have stable chronic stroke after 
6 months.5,16 It is significant that patients enrolled in this study

 Steinberg et al  Transplanted SB623 Cells for Chronic Stroke   1823
had a minimum poststroke time of 6 months at baseline (mean 
poststroke time of 22 months) and were therefore already in a 
chronic stroke setting.
Survival of SB623 Cells
The transfection with Notch-1 in SB623 cells is temporary 
but results in altered patterns of DNA methylation and protein 
expression.12 In preclinical studies, SB623 cells: (1) secrete 
factors that protect cells from hypoxic injury, (2) secrete 
trophic factors that support damaged cells, (3) secrete extra-
cellular matrix proteins that support neural cell growth, (4) 
have anti-inflammatory effects, (5) have immunosuppressive 
effects, (6) promote angiogenesis, (7) promote neuronal stem 
cell migration and differentiation, and (8) provide a biobridge 
of extracellular matrix metalloproteinases.14,15,25,39,40 Because 
transplanted human SB623 cells only survive for 1 month in 
preclinical stroke and nonstroke models,13,25 persistent neuro-
logical recovery may be achieved by the secretion of support-
ive molecules rather than by the integration of transplanted 
stem cells.
Potential Relevance of Postimplant 
Imaging Changes
The positive correlation between the area of post-transplant 
MR T2 FLAIR signal changes, which appeared at 1 week 
and resolved by 1 to 2 months, and measures of neurological 
recovery at 12 months is interesting. The pathogenesis of the 
FLAIR signal changes is unknown, but diffusion-weighted 
image negative and therefore not representative of cytotoxic 
edema (ie, an acute infarct). Despite resolution of FLAIR 
signal changes by 1 to 2 months, the neurological recovery 
documented on several outcome scales was sustained for at 
least 12 months. The observation that the transplanted cells 
likely do not persist for >1 month in preclinical models sug-
gests that the acute cell transplantation stimulates a sustained 
recovery process. Several patients without post-transplant 
FLAIR signal changes showed some neurological recovery, 
although only 1 of the FLAIR-negative patients demon-
strated a clinically meaningful improvement at 12 months. 
The significance of the MR findings is uncertain considering 
the small number of patients, but given the association with 
clinical improvement, it deserves further examination in sub-
sequent studies.
Study Limitations
This study is a small-scale, open-label, dose-escalation, 
Phase 1/2a trial and is therefore limited by its nonrandom-
ized, uncontrolled design and small number of patients. In 
addition, the patient screening process was highly selective, 
with only 4.7% of all screened patients enrolled in the trial. 
Therefore, the application of conclusions from this early 
phase trial to the general chronic stroke population should 
be performed with caution. The definition of stable chronic 
stroke used at baseline in this trial (ie, 2 NIHSS evaluations 
conducted within 3 weeks of enrollment with no score change 
of greater than ±1 point) has also been used in previous tri-
als. However, other studies have defined chronic stable stroke 
by use of minimum changes in several stroke scales during 
6 weeks. Therefore, differences in the definition of chronic 
stable stroke should be considered while interpreting conclu-
sions from this trial.
The positive measures of safety and clinical outcomes 
reported here highlight the need for large-scale Phase 2b and 
3 clinical trials to further evaluate the use of SB623 cells for 
the treatment of chronic stroke.
Conclusions
In this interim analysis of the first intracerebral stem cell 
transplant study for stroke in North America, treatment with 
SB623 cells was generally safe and well tolerated and dem-
onstrated a significant improvement in neurological function 
after 12 months.
