abstract
OBJECTIVE: Improving provider recommendations is critical to addressing low human 
papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination coverage. Thus, we sought to determine the effectiveness 
of training providers to improve their recommendations using either presumptive 
“announcements” or participatory “conversations.”
METHODS: In 2015, we conducted a parallel-group randomized clinical trial with 30 pediatric 
and family medicine clinics in central North Carolina. We randomized clinics to receive no 
training (control), announcement training, or conversation training. Announcements are 
brief statements that assume parents are ready to vaccinate, whereas conversations engage 
parents in open-ended discussions. A physician led the 1-hour, in-clinic training. The North 
Carolina Immunization Registry provided data on the primary trial outcome: 6-month 
coverage change in HPV vaccine initiation (≥1 dose) for adolescents aged 11 or 12 years.
RESULTS: The immunization registry attributed 17 173 adolescents aged 11 or 12 to the 29 
clinics still open at 6-months posttraining. Six-month increases in HPV vaccination coverage 
were larger for patients in clinics that received announcement training versus those in 
control clinics (5.4% difference, 95% confidence interval: 1.1%–9.7%). Stratified analyses 
showed increases for both girls (4.6% difference) and boys (6.2% difference). Patients in 
clinics receiving conversation training did not differ from those in control clinics with 
respect to changes in HPV vaccination coverage. Neither training was effective for changing 
coverage for other vaccination outcomes or for adolescents aged 13 through 17 (n = 37 796).
CONCLUSIONS: Training providers to use announcements resulted in a clinically meaningful 
increase in HPV vaccine initiation among young adolescents.

Versus Conversations to Improve HPV Vaccination Coverage: 
A Randomized Trial. Pediatrics. 2017;139(1):e20161764
WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: National 
guidelines recommend routine human 
papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for all 11- or 
12-year-olds; however, vaccine coverage in the United 
States is persistently low. Provider recommendation 
for HPV vaccination is critical for motivating uptake.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Training providers 
to use announcements resulted in a clinically 
meaningful increase in HPV vaccine initiation among 
11- and 12-year-olds. Training providers to start 
participatory conversations did not increase HPV 
vaccine initiation coverage beyond secular trends.

The United States first licensed 
human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine 
a decade ago, 
 
1 but only 34% of girls 
and 21% of boys aged 13 to 15 had 
completed the 3-dose series by 
2014. 
2 These levels fall far short 
of the Healthy People 2020 goal 
of 80% coverage. 
3 The President’s 
Cancer Panel described this shortfall 
as “a serious but correctable threat 
to progress against cancer.” 
4 An 
important target for intervention 
is HPV vaccine initiation as most 
adolescents who start the series 
complete it.2
A high-quality recommendation by 
a health care provider is a uniquely 
potent motivator of HPV vaccine 
uptake, 
 
5, 
 
6 yet many providers make 
these recommendations hesitantly, 
late, or not at all. 
5, 
 
7– 
9 Provider 
concerns include the time it takes 
to recommend the vaccine, 
 
10 
– 
12 
anticipation of an uncomfortable 
conversation related to sex5, 
 
13, 
 
14 and 
a false perception that parents do 
not value HPV vaccination. 
5, 
 
15 One 
intriguing approach to addressing 
these issues is to use presumptive 
“announcements, 
” or brief statements 
that assume parents are ready 
to vaccinate. Announcements 
are commonly used for early 
childhood vaccines and other 
routine clinical care. Furthermore, 
analyses of videotaped clinician 
encounters16, 
 
17 and a nationally 
representative survey 
18 suggest that 
announcements are associated with 
higher vaccine uptake. Alternatively, 
a “conversation” approach that 
engages parents in open-ended 
discussions may build rapport and 
thus increase parental openness to 
HPV vaccination for their children. 
19 
Although a previous trial did not find 
evidence that conversations improve 
parents’ vaccination attitudes, 
the impact of the approach on 
vaccination outcomes has not been 
tested. 
19
In the absence of previously 
published randomized trials, it 
is unclear whether providers 
who are trained to improve 
their recommendations using 
announcements or conversations 
are more successful in increasing 
HPV vaccination coverage compared 
with providers who do not receive 
such training. We hypothesized that 
either announcement training or 
conversation training would lead to 
larger increases in HPV vaccination 
coverage compared with no training.
METHODS
Participants
We sought to enroll 30 primary care 
clinics into the trial. Clinics were 
eligible to enroll if they specialized 
in pediatric or family medicine; had 
100 or more patients aged 11 or 12 
attributed to the clinic in the North 
Carolina Immunization Registry 
(NCIR) as of March 2014; were 
located within a 2-hour drive of 
Chapel Hill, North Carolina; and had 
at least 1 pediatric or family medicine 
physician who provided HPV vaccine 
to adolescents aged 11 or 12. Clinics 
were ineligible for the trial if they had 
taken part in quality improvement 
efforts to increase HPV vaccination 
rates in the previous 6 months or 
planned to do so over the next 6 
months. We identified 150 eligible 
clinics based on NCIR data.
The parallel-group trial design had 
3 arms: announcement training, 
conversation training, or control. A 
biostatistician unaffiliated with the 
trial used a 1:1:1 allocation ratio to 
randomize to trial arm, stratifying 
clinics based on their patient volume 
( 
Fig 1). Between March and August 
2015, we conducted recruitment 
efforts until we met the trial quota 
of 10 clinics enrolled per arm. 
When a clinic expressed interest 
in participating, we determined 
whether vaccine-prescribing 
clinicians practiced at clinics 
randomized to different trial arms 
(ie, provider crossover) and included 
only the eligible clinic appearing 
first on our list, excluding the other 
clinic from the trial. Although clinics 
could not be blinded as to whether 
they received a training, we did not 
alert them ahead of the training as 
to which strategy they would learn. 
Patients were unaware of the training 
of providers. Of the clinics that did 
not enroll, 66 were unreachable, 38 
declined, 14 were excluded (8 had 
participated or were planning to 
participate in HPV vaccination quality 
improvement efforts, 3 did not have 
an HPV vaccine prescriber, 3 had 
provider crossover), and 2 expressed 
interest after we met the trial’s clinic 
enrollment quota. Compared with 
clinics in the intervention arms, 
fewer control arm clinics declined 
trial participation and more were 
unreachable. The number of 11- or 
12-year-olds attributed to enrolled 
clinics and unenrolled clinics did not 
differ as of March 2014. Providers 
consented to be in the trial before the 
start of training sessions.
Procedures
From May to August 2015, a 
physician educator traveled to 
intervention clinics to deliver 
the 1-hour trainings to vaccine-
prescribing clinicians (eg, physicians, 
physician assistants, and nurse 
practitioners) and other clinic 
staff, who may support parents’ 
decisions to vaccinate their children. 
Providers received up to 1 prescribed 
continuing medical education 
credit for attending the training. 
Intervention clinics received up to 
$800 and control clinics received 
$200. The University of North 
Carolina Institutional Review Board 
approved the trial protocol.
Intervention
Formative Research
To inform the development of the 
announcement and conversation 
trainings, we conducted formative 
research that included national 
surveys of US primary care 
physicians 
5, 
 
11 and parents of 
adolescents. 
6 We integrated the

surveys’ findings with other 
published findings and feedback 
from an expert panel of pediatricians, 
family physicians, other vaccine 
providers, and researchers. These 
experts did not practice at our pilot 
or trial clinics. In April 2015, we 
piloted our trainings in 2 clinics, 
conducted follow-up phone calls with 
3 of the clinics’ vaccine-prescribing 
clinicians to gather additional 
feedback, reviewed posttraining 
satisfaction surveys, and refined the 
trainings.
Training Content
The announcement training, 
informed by the work of Opel 
and colleagues, 
 
16, 
 
17 included the 
steps shown in  
Fig 2A. The darker 
boxes indicate requisite steps for 
delivering announcements, whereas 
lighter boxes are necessary only 
if the previous step did not result 
in HPV vaccination. We instructed 
providers to first announce that the 
child is due for 3 vaccines to be given 
today. Key elements of this first step 
included providers mentioning the 
child’s age; announcing the child is 
due for 3 vaccines recommended 
for children this age, placing HPV 
vaccine in the middle of list; and 
saying they will vaccinate today 
(Supplemental Fig 3). Only if parents 
raised a concern would providers 
then identify and ease parents’ 
main concern about HPV vaccine, 
using a structured approach 
20 and 
strongly recommending same-day 
HPV vaccination. Key elements of this 
final step included providers giving 
a motivational statement, ending 
with the phrase “I recommend …” 
and encouraging parents to get HPV 
vaccine that day (Supplemental 
Fig 3).
In contrast, the conversation 
training built on the principles of 
shared decision making. It differed 
from the announcement training 
primarily in the first step. We 
instructed providers to first start 
the conversation about 3 adolescent 
vaccines. Key elements of this first 
step included providers introducing 
the 3 vaccines recommended for 
children this age, placing HPV 
vaccine in the middle of the list to 
deemphasize it and make it routine, 
 
21 
discussing the health benefits 
of these vaccines, and inviting 
parents’ questions while saving the 
recommendation for later in the 
conversation ( 
Fig 2B).
For both trainings, we provided 
general advice on addressing 
common problems posed by HPV 
vaccine communication. For instance, 
if parents associated the vaccine with 
sex, we suggested providers redirect 
the conversation to be about cancer 
prevention. If parents asked which 
vaccines are required for school 
attendance and which are optional, 
we suggested providers redirect the 
conversation by saying they strongly 
recommend all 3 adolescent vaccines.

Both trainings suggested providers 
ask parents who did not agree to 
vaccination to return in 2 months to 
further discuss vaccination.
Training Procedures
The physician educator used a 
standardized script and PowerPoint 
slide set to lead the 4-part training. 
The first section, “Review Evidence, 
” 
was a didactic review of the latest 
research on HPV vaccination 
practices, HPV vaccine effectiveness, 
safety, and the rationale for 
targeting younger adolescents. In the 
second section, “Build Skills, 
” 
the physician educator taught 
participants how to deliver effective 
HPV vaccine recommendations 
using either announcements or 
conversations, depending on the 
training. This section included step-
by-step instruction as well as a 
demonstration. In the third section, 
“Practice, 
” the physician educator 
gave participants a note card that 
outlined relevant steps and asked 
them to complete a brief exercise to 
adapt the suggested material to their 
own personal style and language 
(Supplemental Fig 3). This section 
included role-play with a colleague 
and discussion about the benefits and 
challenges of using announcements 
or conversations. In the fourth 
section, “Application to Your Practice, 
” 
the physician educator engaged 
participants in a discussion of how 
they would apply the training to their 
clinical practice, allowing them to 
align their communication as a group.
After the training, vaccine-
prescribing clinicians agreed to use 
announcements or conversations 
to recommend HPV vaccination for 
at least 5 vaccine-eligible patients 
within 2 weeks. 
22 We asked that 
participants not share the training 
content outside their clinics. Clinics 
in the waitlist control condition 
received a video recording of the 
announcement training, which was 
sent 1 month after the 6-month 
assessment of vaccination outcomes.
Measures
NCIR provided clinic-level data on 
vaccination coverage, specialty, 
patient volume (ie, count of 
patients attributed to the clinic in 
NCIR), patient sex, and patients’ 
eligibility for publicly funded 
vaccines ( 
Table 1). Used by >90% 
of vaccine providers in the state, 
NCIR is a secure, Web-based 
registry that contains immunization 
information for almost all North 
Carolina adolescents. 
23, 
 
24 NCIR 
had vaccination data for the 
highest percentage of adolescents 
of any state as of 2013. 
24 NCIR 
provides data on vaccination status, 
attributing all vaccine doses to the 
clinic at which the adolescent is a 
patient at the time of data collection. 
We calculated changes in vaccine 
coverage, from baseline to 3 months 
and 6 months posttraining at the 
clinic, among adolescents aged 
11 or 12 and 13 through 17. We 
matched the trial arms on timing 
of trainings and assessments to 
control for seasonal variation in 
vaccination. Vaccine coverage 
was assessed for the cohort of 
adolescents attributed to each clinic 
as of 6-months postintervention. We 
assessed coverage for the following 
vaccines: HPV initiation (≥1 dose); 
HPV completion (3 doses); tetanus 
toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, 
and acellular pertussis (Tdap); and 
meningococcal conjugate (≥1 dose). 
The primary trial outcome was 
change in HPV vaccination initiation 
between baseline and 6-months post-
intervention for adolescents ages 
11 or 12. The remaining vaccination 
outcomes were secondary trial 
outcomes. We used data for a single 
cohort in each clinic, although some 
adolescents may not have had a 
visit with their provider during this 
6-month trial period.
Statistical Analysis
Power analyses assumed each trial 
arm would have 10 clinics that 
served 5000 adolescents aged 11 or 
12, baseline HPV vaccine initiation 
coverage of 45%, α = .05. We 
estimated 80% power to detect a 
2.7% difference between the control 
and each intervention arm in HPV 
vaccine initiation coverage from 
baseline to follow-up. Analyses of 
trial data used a modified intent-to-
treat approach that included enrolled 
clinics with data available at baseline 
and 6-months postintervention. To 
assess whether clinic characteristics 
differed by trial arm, we used Fisher’s 
exact test and analysis of variance. 
To analyze intervention effects, 
we performed mixed-level Poisson

regressions for each vaccination 
outcome, modeling the change in 
vaccine coverage from baseline to 
3- and 6-month follow-up at the 
level of the patient. Regression 
models included a random 
intercept to account for unobserved 
heterogeneity among clinics as well 
as an offset variable equal to the log 
of the number of adolescent patients 
at each clinic. Analyses accounted 
for clustering of data by clinic. We 
report unadjusted proportions for 
vaccine coverage data at 3 and 6 
months posttraining. Analyses were 
conducted in SAS version 9.4 (SAS, 
Cary, NC), using 2-tailed tests and a 
critical α = .05.
RESULTS
Clinic Characteristics
Of the 30 clinics enrolled in the 
trial, 29 had accessible data for 
3- and 6-month vaccine coverage 
assessments (1 clinic that received 
announcement training closed before 
follow-up assessments). No clinics 
or participants withdrew due to 
adverse events. Most were pediatric 
clinics (76%). As of 6 months 
posttraining, NCIR attributed 17 173 
adolescents aged 11 or 12 and 37 796 
adolescents aged 13 through 17 to 
the clinics. A mean of 5 (range 2–12) 
vaccine prescribers practiced at 
each clinic. Trial arms did not differ 
on these clinic characteristics but 
did differ with respect to baseline 
vaccination coverage ( 
Table 1). Of 
vaccine prescribers at intervention 
clinics, attendance was 90% for 
announcement trainings and 89% 
for conversation trainings. Of vaccine 
prescribers who attended trainings, 
92% were present for the majority 
(ie, at least three-quarters) of the 
announcement training, and 99% 
were present for the majority of 
the conversation training. As is 
typical, some clinics received quality 
improvement visits from the state 
immunization branch during the 
follow-up period (2 that received 
announcement training, 3 that 
received conversation training, and 3 
in the control arm).
Trial Outcomes
Clinics that received announcement 
training had increases in HPV vaccine 
initiation coverage at 6 months for 
11- or 12-year-olds that exceeded 
control clinics’ increases (5.4% 
difference, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] 1.1% to 9.7%), the primary trial 
outcome ( 
Table 2). This difference 
represents 37 more patients who 
initiated HPV vaccination. Sex-
stratified analyses also showed 
greater increases in coverage at 6 
months among girls (4.6% difference, 
95% CI 0.1% to 9.0%) and among 
boys (6.2% difference, 95% CI 1.5% 
to 11.0%). These increases were 
already observable by 3 months for 
11- or 12-year-olds overall (5.1%

(5.6% difference, 95% CI 2.0% to

Clinics that received conversation 
training did not differ from the 
control arm on coverage change 
for HPV vaccine initiation among 
adolescents ages 11 or 12 (all Ps > 
.05). Intervention arms did not differ 
from the control arm with respect 
to other ages (adolescents aged 13 
through 17) or other vaccination 
coverage, including HPV series 
completion, Tdap, and meningococcal 
(Supplemental Tables 3 and 4).
DISCUSSION
A decade after HPV vaccine licensure, 
coverage remains low, in part 
because of missed opportunities 
for providers to recommend 
the vaccine. 
25 Our trial found 
that a brief, 1-hour training in 
using announcements increased 
coverage for HPV vaccine initiation 
by 5 percentage points over the 
control for 11- and 12-year-old 
adolescents. Training providers 
to start recommendations with a 
participatory conversation did not 
increase coverage.
Researchers have used various 
names for announcements, including 
“paternalistic, 
” “presumptive, 
” and 
“efficient communication.” We 
prefer the term “announcement” 
as it describes the communication 
behavior impartially. Our findings 
are consistent with observational 
studies that suggest announcements 
encourages vaccination, a hypothesis 
first advanced by Opel. 
16, 
 
17 In an 
analysis of 111 videotaped provider-
parent discussions, parental 
acceptance of early childhood 
vaccines was more common 
when providers started their 
communication using what Opel 
called a “presumptive format.” 
16, 
 
17 
Similarly, Moss and colleagues found 
that among a probability sample of 
4121 parents of adolescents from 
the National Immunization Survey—
Teen, HPV vaccination coverage 
was higher among adolescent girls 
of parents who recalled “efficient” 
provider communication about 
HPV vaccination than those who 
recalled participatory discussions.18 
We speculate that announcements 
normalize HPV vaccination for both 
providers and parents, making 
providers more likely to raise the 
topic and parents more likely to 
consent to vaccination. In contrast, 
our conversation training did not 
increase HPV vaccine initiation. This 
outcome mirrors the findings of a 
trial by Henrikson and colleagues 
who found that participatory 
communication training was 
ineffective in reducing hesitant 
attitudes toward early childhood 
vaccination, as assessed by a survey 
of 347 mothers. 
19
The absence of change for 3-dose 
HPV vaccine series completion 
observed in the current trial may 
be due to the intervention’s focus 
on vaccine initiation, the 6-month 
follow-up period, and a decline in 
visits to a provider. We speculate 
an absence of change in vaccine 
coverage among older adolescents 
may also be due, in part, to a 
decline in visits to a provider. Our 
intervention sought to change 
provider behavior during a clinical 
encounter but not to change the 
frequency of clinic visits.
By achieving a clinically 
meaningful improvement in HPV 
vaccine initiation coverage, the 
announcement training fills an 
important gap. Providers describe 
needing a brief recommendation 
approach that avoids discussing sex 
and gives parents an opportunity to 
ask questions should they wish to, 
issues that our trainings addressed. 
14 
Additional research is needed to 
better understand how trainings 
improve coverage and the extent to 
which providers use announcements 
in routine clinical practice.
Strengths of our trial include an 
effective, brief, and standardized 
intervention; having clinic-provided 
data on vaccination; and having 
a large sample of vaccine-eligible 
adolescents at trial clinics. We chose 
a physician to deliver the trainings, 
but future research will need to 
establish whether educators with 
different backgrounds would be 
as effective. A benefit of holding 
trainings at providers’ own clinics 
is that it allowed most members 
of health care teams to attend, 
but we do not know what impact 
the trainings would have in other 
settings, such as a national meeting, 
or other modes, such as a webinar. 
Although our trial was conducted in 
larger clinics in urban and rural areas 
of 1 Southeastern US state, we do 
not know whether the findings will 
generalize to other areas of the US, 
to large managed-care organizations, 
to smaller clinics, or to clinics that 
do not use immunization registries. 
Trial findings may represent more 
motivated clinics as many eligible 
clinics were unreachable or declined. 
We attempted to limit contamination 
by randomizing at the clinic level, 
randomizing before recruiting, and 
discouraging participants from 
sharing the strategy outside their 
clinics. It is possible that some 
spillover occurred, and if it did, our 
evaluation would underestimate 
the effects of the intervention. 
Differences by trial arm in baseline 
vaccination coverage also may 
have affected the magnitude of 
the observed intervention effect. 
Future research can extend the 
present trial by comparing the 
effectiveness of announcement 
training in clinics with low and high 
vaccination coverage. We did not 
assess clinics’ use of electronic health 
records nor clinicians’ adherence 
to recommendation approaches 
through visit observation. Research 
is needed to identify how parents and 
their adolescent children respond 
to announcements. Although our 
evaluation focused on how best to

CONCLUSIONS
A brief training in improving HPV 
vaccine recommendations using 
announcements increased HPV 
vaccine initiation among adolescents 
at the recommended ages for 
routine vaccination. Our findings 
support training providers to use 
announcements as an approach to 
address low HPV vaccination uptake 
in primary care clinics.
