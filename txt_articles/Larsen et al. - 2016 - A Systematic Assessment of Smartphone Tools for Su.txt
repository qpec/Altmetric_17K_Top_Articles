Abstract
Background
Suicide is a leading cause of death globally, and there has been a rapid growth in the use of
new technologies such as mobile health applications (apps) to help identify and support those
at risk. However, it is not known whether these apps are evidence-based, or indeed contain
potentially harmful content. This review examines the concordance of features in publicly
available apps with current scientific evidence of effective suicide prevention strategies.
Methods
Apps referring to suicide or deliberate self-harm (DSH) were identified on the Android and
iOS app stores. Systematic review methodology was employed to screen and review app
content. App features were labelled using a coding scheme that reflected the broad range
of evidence-based medical and population-based suicide prevention interventions. Best-
practice for suicide prevention was based upon a World Health Organization report and sup-
plemented by other reviews of the literature.
Results
One hundred and twenty-three apps referring to suicide were identified and downloaded for
full review, 49 of which were found to contain at least one interactive suicide prevention fea-
ture. Most apps focused on obtaining support from friends and family (n = 27) and safety
planning (n = 14). Of the different suicide prevention strategies contained within the apps,
the strongest evidence in the literature was found for facilitating access to crisis support (n =
13). All reviewed apps contained at least one strategy that was broadly consistent with the
evidence base or best-practice guidelines. Apps tended to focus on a single suicide preven-
tion strategy (mean = 1.1), although safety plan apps provided the opportunity to provide a
greater number of techniques (mean = 3.9). Potentially harmful content, such as listing
lethal access to means or encouraging risky behaviour in a crisis, was also identified.
Discussion
Many suicide prevention apps are available, some of which provide elements of best prac-
tice, but none that provide comprehensive evidence-based support. Apps with potentially

 harmful content were also identified. Despite the number of apps available, and their varied
purposes, there is a clear need to develop useful, pragmatic, and multifaceted mobile
resources for this population. Clinicians should be wary in recommending apps, especially
as potentially harmful content can be presented as helpful. Currently safety plan apps are
the most comprehensive and evidence-informed, for example, “Safety Net” and “Mood-
Tools—Depression Aid”.
Introduction
Rationale
Suicide is a leading cause of death globally, particularly amongst young people [1]. Although
immediate help during a crisis is critical, those who may be experiencing suicidal ideation or
crisis experience barriers to help-seeking, such as not perceiving a need for professional help,
lack of time, preference for informal help, access to and cost of services, and fear of stigma and
disclosure [2]. With the increasing ubiquity of mobile phones, health applications (apps) have
the potential to improve access and availability of evidence-based support to this group, as
apps are low-cost, convenient, and discreet. Apps may be especially suited to deliver suicide
prevention interventions with their ability to deliver support and intervention in situ and at the
time of crisis. As suicide ideation and suicide risk change rapidly, access to high quality mobile
resources may save lives.
Consumers are rapidly embracing apps, proactively seeking apps to manage their personal
health. Recent data suggest 85% of young people in the USA own a smartphone, three quarters
of whom have used their device to access health information [3]. In a survey in the psychiatric
out-patient setting, 69% of respondents and 80% of those aged 45 years or younger indicated a
desire to use a mobile app to track their mental health [4].
This consumer enthusiasm for apps to manage mental health has spurred the development
of numerous apps for suicide prevention. Many of these offer digitised versions of tools and
strategies common in mental health. However, to our knowledge the content of these apps has
not been investigated. There is also an absence of efficacy data for apps related to suicide pre-
vention, although the publication of designs [5], proof-of-concept results [6], and protocols for
evaluation studies [7] are indicative of the future research direction. Assessment of content is
vital, as the Android [8] and iOS [9] app stores do not have guidelines specifically related to the
restriction of pro-suicidal content, or app content quality. Therefore, we currently do not know
whether apps provide potential harmful content which promotes suicide or encourages suicidal
behaviour [10], nor whether their content is consistent with clinical and population based
policy.
In previous work, Donker et al. found that mental health apps evaluated in randomised con-
trolled trials [11] were not publicly available, while those with no research evidence were.
Reviews of apps for other mental and physical disorders support this, reporting low adherence
to clinical best practice, or the provision of unreliable, unsuitable tools [12–14]. In the present
review, in view of the absence of published efficacy data for existing apps, we use the corpus of
extant research trial evidence to address whether the features of publicly available health apps
for suicide prevention are consistent with the research evidence. Suicide prevention strategies
identified within the apps were ranked according to the strength of the evidence, as indicated
by inclusion in the World Health Organization report by Scott and Guo [15], inclusion in
other published systematic reviews [16–18], or inclusion in the Suicide Prevention Resource
Centre Best Practices Registry [19].

 The findings from this review will inform clinicians and consumers of the content quality of
suicide prevention apps currently available in the marketplace. An examination of the evidence
base of app components will assist clinicians in recommending particular apps as part of
adjunctive care and those promoting apps through the web to prioritise those most consistent
with current evidence. Ultimately, this review will assist consumers to find apps consistent
with best practice, and developers to consider the evidence-base of content during app design.
Objectives
Using descriptive methodology, the primary aim of this study was to compare evidence-based
strategies undertaken for suicide prevention with the content of publicly available apps provid-
ing tools for suicide prevention.
Methods
Eligibility criteria
Huckvale et al. highlighted the difference between informational and tool-based apps in a
review of apps for asthma [14]. Tool-based apps are “active” or “interactive” as defined by De
Jaegere et al. [20], specifically requiring active involvement from the user, or allowing users to
interact with one another. Meanwhile, “passive” apps are those that solely present content,
which could be in a variety of formats such as text or video, but require no user input or inter-
action beyond navigating through the content. In this review, only “active” or “interactive”
apps were included due to the previously identified challenges in identifying the provenance of
information contained within suicide prevention apps [21].
In the current review, free and paid-for apps containing content related to suicide were
included if they could be downloaded via the official Android and iOS stores. Apps were
excluded if they: contained no “active” or “interactive” suicide prevention content; referred to
suicide non-literally, for example in branding, or music titles; referred specifically to self-harm
with non-suicidal intent; were related exclusively to depression, bipolar disorder, or other men-
tal health conditions, unless suicidality was explicitly mentioned; or were not in English, or
included character sets which did not display correctly.
Information sources
Apps were identified by searching the Australian Google Play store (Android) via its web inter-
face, and the Australian iTunes store (iOS) using its search application programming interface
(API). Results were limited by the search engines to a maximum of 250 (Android) or 200 (iOS)
apps, and all of these search results were screened.
Search
A set of core search terms related to suicide was created: suicid�; parasuicid�; kill me/myself/
yourself; take my/your [own] life; self[–]harm�; DSH. To ensure consistency in the stemming
of search terms across the two app stores, these keywords were manually expanded to create a
comprehensive set of terms (see S2 Text). The terms related to deliberate self-harm (DSH)
allowed the initial identification of apps where self-harming behaviours are with, without, or
with unclear suicidal intention. Search terms on the Google Play store were surrounded by
quotation marks to ensure the exact phrases were matched–this functionality was performed
automatically by the iTunes search API. The unique identifier, title, description, and price of
each app were retrieved from the app store, and apps which appeared in the results for multiple
search terms were de-duplicated.

 App selection
During the screening stage, two reviewers independently assessed the title and description of
each app against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The reason for each exclusion was
recorded. Results of the screening were compared, and discrepancies were resolved by discus-
sion until consensus was achieved. All apps that were identified as being eligible for inclusion
were downloaded and installed on a Samsung Galaxy S4 mini (Android version 4.2) or iPhone
5s (iOS version 7.1) for full content review.
Data collection process
Following download, each app was opened and assessed independently by the two reviewers to
confirm eligibility. The content and features of the apps were then independently reviewed for
both harmful and suicide prevention content. The reviewers used a custom coding scheme (see
Data Items section), and coded the interventional components directly into a database created
for the review. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion until consensus was achieved.
Data items
Suicide prevention strategies are broad, ranging from population based activities (such as
restricting access to means) to specific treatment interventions (such as dialectical behaviour
therapy, DBT). Moreover, suicide is commonly experienced in a range of mental and physical
health conditions. Apps may also contain potentially harmful content, and may be targeted at
different user groups with different purposes (for example consumers, or clinicians). To
accommodate these multiple facets, we developed four broad categories on which data were
extracted for each app, as described below.
App characteristics.
The download cost for each app, whether free or paid-for, was
recorded. Apps which contained any suicide prevention content were broadly categorised
based on their primary function. The following distinct foci were determined: primarily or
solely suicide prevention; depression (for example, an app which mentions suicide in the con-
text of depression); deliberate self-harm; physical health or other mental health (for example,
an app may include suicide as one of many health topics); or setting-based psychological or
general support (for example, a university information app which mentions suicide prevention
as part of its welfare programme). This categorisation allowed us to compare apps with a spe-
cific focus on suicide prevention and those in which suicide prevention is embedded within a
wider context.
Harmful content. Harmful information was coded using a synthesis of schemes used by
Biddle et al. [10], Tam et al. [22], and Westerlund et al. [23] in their reviews of suicidal content
on the internet. The harmful categories were: describing or facilitating access to lethal means;
providing encouragement to people to end their life; portraying suicide in a fashionable or
appealing manner; or an open category for other harmful content.
App quality.
In line with previous eHealth and suicide prevention reviews [10, 20, 21, 24]
we rated broader app quality indicators. These quality-related features included: the type of
developer or provider of the app (Q1); whether the provider name or contact details was explic-
itly stated within the app (Q2); whether references for the source of app content was included
(Q3); whether a privacy policy was included within the app or app store description (Q4);
whether the app could be protected with an account login, password or personal identification
number (Q5); and whether bugs or reliability issues were apparent through use of the app
(although the reviewers did not seek to exhaustively test the app for reliability; Q6).
Suicide prevention tools.
The spectrum of suicide prevention strategies is wide, spanning
public health interventions associated with prevention in the general population, those targeted

 at higher risk groups, and mental health interventions for treatment and maintenance. In this
review, strategies were coded based on the spectrum initially presented by Mrazek and Hagg-
erty [25], and as reported by Scott and Guo in their report for the World Health Organization
[15]. For convenience, we divided the strategies into the following five categories: public health,
screening, accessing support, mental health/treatment strategies, and follow-up strategies.
Public health strategies. Suicide prevention strategies include public health techniques
targeting: information about legislation and policies restricting access to lethal means (S1);
guidelines for media reporting of suicides (S2); and material about organisational, regional, or
national suicide prevention strategies and policies (S3). These public health strategies were
expected to be largely information-based and unlikely to be delivered through an interactive
mobile app, however they were retained in the coding scheme for completeness.
Screening strategies. This category consisted of strategies to improve screening and detec-
tion of suicidal risk, with apps targeted at physicians (S4); those in gatekeeper roles (S5); or for
individuals to self-screen (S6).
Accessing support strategies. Content to encourage or facilitate getting access to help
included: requesting help and support from peers or family (S7); accessing help via a gate-
keeper (S8); accessing non-crisis support services (S9); and access to crisis support and help-
lines (S10). For those apps which provided crisis support details, an additional data item was
recorded to assess whether the crisis contacts were always visible within the app (for example,
through a “get help now” button; S10a), as suggested by De Jaegere et al. [20].
Mental health/treatment strategies.
Mental health strategies focussed on preventing sui-
cide either before or after an attempt. These strategies included: psychotherapy (S11); pharma-
cotherapy (S12); non-drug physical therapies (S13); the use of safety plans (S14); and
postvention support for those bereaved by suicide (S15). As suicide safety plans contain multi-
ple components and address a number of suicide prevention strategies, we performed a sepa-
rate sub-analysis of the content of these apps. As with the public health category, we did not
expect all of these strategies to be deliverable through an app (for example, drug or electrocon-
vulsive therapy), however they were retained for completeness, and to record possible inclu-
sion, for example, as part of a treatment diary.
Follow-up strategies.
Additional longer-term strategies focussed specifically on follow-up
support after a suicide attempt. These strategies included: ongoing outreach and contact (S16);
adherence management (S17); and peer support for those who have made a suicide attempt
(S18).
Evidence quality.
After coding the apps’ suicide prevention strategies into the five catego-
ries described above, the quality of evidence for each strategy was rated from the extant litera-
ture for reducing suicide. As noted previously, we developed a coding scheme based upon the
WHO report by Scott and Guo [15], and prevention strategies were coded as having strong evi-
dence (E1) if they were consistent with findings in this report. Supplementary evidence was
gathered from reviews by Mann et al. [16], Leitner et al. [17], and Shekelle et al. [18], and strat-
egies with some degree of evidence from these reviews were coded as E2. Finally, if there was a
lack of evidence within these reviews, a final check was made with the Suicide Prevention
Resource Centre Best Practices Registry [19] to check if the strategy was at least consistent with
expert ratings of best practice (E3). Otherwise, we coded a strategy as containing no relevant
evidence (E4).
Summary measures
The number and percentage of apps satisfying each of the coding elements are reported. For
each suicide prevention strategy contained within the apps, the coded evidence quality is also

 reported. The number of strategies and apps containing recognised evidence is reported, along
with the number of suicide prevention strategies per app.
Results
App selection
The PRISMA flowchart for the review is shown in Fig 1. From the original 1271 search results,
the descriptions of 856 unique apps were screened, and 123 apps were downloaded for review.
Seventy-four apps were excluded following download, including 13 that did not contain any
suicide prevention content. Eight of these 13 apps were games with the aim of killing or inflict-
ing harm upon the character, including Russian Roulette. One of the excluded apps suggested
risky behaviour, including deliberate self-harm or taking drugs, as an alternative to a suicide
attempt. These suggestions contained disclaimers relating to the risk, possible legal conse-
quences, and the lack of concordance with professional medical advice.
Fifty-two of the reviewed apps were excluded as they did not provide interactive features to
support suicide prevention. As expected, these informational apps described a wider range of
suicide prevention strategies than could be incorporated into a tool-based app. In addition to
components identified in the evidence review (described in the following sections), information
was provided about: media reporting guidelines (one app; S2), national suicide prevention
guidelines (one app; S3), gatekeeper screening for suicide (seven apps; S5), gatekeeper access to
support (eight apps; S8), pharmacotherapy (four apps; S12), and non-drug physical therapies
(one app; S13). None of these excluded apps contained information on adherence management
(S17), or peer-support for those who attempt suicide (S18). The remaining 49 apps (Android:
20, iOS: 29) were included in the evidence review (S1 Dataset).
App characteristics
All 20 of the reviewed Android apps were free, while seven of the iOS apps required payment
to download (four at AU$1.29, one at AU$2.49, one at AU$3.79, and one at AU$18.99).

 Approximately half of the apps downloaded and reviewed were suicide-specific (n = 24,
49.0%). Of those apps with a wider context, five apps had a focus on depression (10.2%), four
on deliberate self-harm (8.2%, none with a specific focus on self-harm with suicidal intent), six
on general health information (12.2%), and 10 on general support (20.4%).
Harmful content. In addition to the potentially harmful content described for the
excluded apps, two additional apps contained a list of means of instant death, although this
was presented as suggestions for removing access to means. The risks of presenting lethal
means have been discussed in previous work looking at the presentation of suicide on the inter-
net [10, 22].
App quality.
The majority of apps were developed (Q1) by academic/healthcare institu-
tions, or commercial organisations (20 apps, 40.8%, each). Five apps (10.2%) were privately
developed by individuals, and the type of provider was not clear for four apps (8.2%). Despite
this range of developers, only 34 (69.4%; 13 suicide-specific apps, 54.2%) included contact
details of the provider within the app (Q2).
Although the apps were interactive, delivering a resource to users, just six (12.2%; one sui-
cide-specific app, 4.2%) referenced the source of the content (Q3). While many apps prompted
users to enter personal data, less than a half (19 apps, 38.8%; seven suicide-specific apps,
29.2%) included a privacy policy (Q4). Fewer still offered the option to protect the app with an
account login, password, or personal identification number (eight apps, 16.3%; three suicide-
specific apps, 12.5%; Q5). Nineteen apps (38.8%; eight suicide-specific apps, 33.3%) demon-
strated obvious bugs or reliability issues during the content review (Q6).
Suicide prevention tools.
Table 1 shows the suicide prevention tools that were found in
the 49 reviewed apps. The 24 apps which pertained primarily to suicide prevention are shown
separately. Accessing peer support and safety plans were the most common features in the
apps with a suicide prevention focus, as well as those with a broader focus. Follow-up strategies
were least commonly identified within both groups of apps.

 Public health strategies. The only public health strategy identified within the apps related
to means access restriction (S1), although this was at the level of an individual, rather than a
population. Seven apps (six suicide-specific) allowed the user to identify lethal means that
should be removed from their environment in the context of a safety plan (S14). No apps con-
tained interactive features relating to media reporting guidelines (S2), or suicide prevention
policies (S3).
Screening strategies. Sixteen apps provided interactive screening tools for depression or
suicidality: three for mental health professionals (S4), and 13 for individuals to self-screen (S6).
No apps provided gatekeeper screening tools (S5).
Two of the self-screening apps were suicide-specific, whereas none of the professional
screening apps were primarily focussed on suicide. Nevertheless, one of the professional
screening apps contained customised instruments to assist mental health professionals in
screening for both suicidality and depression. The second app contained the Hamilton Rating
Scale for Depression [26], and the third app included an extended version of the PHQ-9 [27]
with additional questions related to suicide, paranoia, hallucinations, and mania.
Of the 13 self-screening apps, two (both suicide-specific) contained a custom screening tool
for detecting suicidality, including items on suicidal thoughts, social withdrawal, denying
responsibilities, and other warning signs. The remaining self-screening apps focussed on
depression: four presented an extended DSM scale, four used a modified or expanded PHQ-9
scale [27], and one which was designed specifically for post-natal depression, reproduced the
Edinburgh post-natal depression survey [28]. The remaining two apps provided custom
screening tools, one app specifically for depression based on a list of symptoms, and the other
app provided multiple custom tools to screen for anxiety, depression, substance use, and
suicide.
Eight of the self-screening apps directed users to seek support from health or mental health
professionals, or provided crisis support information when users screened high on depression
or suicidality measures. Two apps additionally suggested users might be suitable for psycho-
therapy or antidepressant treatment, but did not directly suggest seeking help. Three further
apps did not direct users to help-seeking options, however two were designed to be used as a
checklist prior to an appointment with a health professional, and the final app used the screen-
ing results to populate a list of suggested tasks, including seeking help, in another section of the
app.
Accessing support strategies. Apps enabling access to support directed users to either
peer support networks, non-crisis support, or crisis support services. None of the reviewed
apps provided interactive access to gatekeeper services (S8). Of the apps providing access to
help, 27 (16 suicide-specific) apps allowed users to access support from their peers, friends, or
family (S7). Approximately half of the apps providing this function did so as part of a safety
plan (n = 14; 13 suicide-specific). Eight of the non-safety-plan apps (three suicide-specific)
allowed the user to nominate people as supporters and facilitated easy contact during a crisis.
The remaining five apps (all non-suicide-specific) additionally allowed users to interact with
one another within the app–users could share and discuss common experiences, and support
others. This interaction and support took many forms with users interacting through photo
sharing in one app, and by video sharing in another. One app also included a personal peer-to-
peer support function where users could request support, or nominate times throughout the
week when they were available to provide support. Of the five apps which offered peer interac-
tion, four offered some degree of content moderation. Two of these apps specifically indicated
that discussion of dangerous, unsafe, or violent acts would be removed; one other app included
a function for alerting the service provider about worrying posts; and in one other app all con-
tent was centrally approved before being made publicly available.

 Twelve apps (10 suicide-specific) also provided access to non-crisis support services (S9),
with 11 apps (10 suicide-specific) doing so within a safety plan. The remaining app was devel-
oped specifically for a clinical psychology practice and provided active access to the practice via
a direct text message.
A further 13 apps (10 suicide-specific) provided access to crisis support services (S10), seven
of which (four suicide-specific) were independent of safety plans. Of these, five apps (four sui-
cide-specific) contained interactive crisis support or helpline components. These features
included: finding the nearest crisis centre based up location/GPS data (four apps, which were
localised versions of the same app); and the ability for the user to enter their own crisis support
contact (one app). Two apps also offered features for users to interact with other people. Both
apps allowed users to initiate contact with an organisation-affiliated support service, either by
text message or online chat capabilities. None of the 13 apps which provided access to crisis
support services ensured that this access was visible at all times within the app (S10a).
Mental health strategies.
Safety planning (S14) was a prevalent mental health strategy
contained with the reviewed apps, and is reported separately in a following section. Two apps
also provided some degree of interactive psychotherapeutic content (S11), and another two
provided postvention support for those bereaved by suicide (S15). No apps provided interactive
features related to pharmacotherapy (S12) or physical therapies (S13).
Both of the apps which delivered psychotherapy were based on cognitive therapy–one in the
context of depression, and the other for deliberate self-harm. Both apps used thought challeng-
ing techniques: the depression app provided a tool that assisted users in identifying and chal-
lenging negative thoughts, while the DSH app provided a space to think about negative
thoughts and to reframe them positively. The psychological content of both apps was self-
guided, with no personalised input from a mental health professional. However, the DSH-ori-
entated app did offer advice based on user-entered responses to motivations behind the current
urge to harm, and suggested strategies or activities to distract users until the urge subsided.
The two postvention apps provided an interactive plan for those bereaved by suicide. This
was similar to a safety plan, in which the user completed sections of their plan after watching
short videos that discussed different aspects of suicide bereavement. Elements of the plan
included information, thoughts, and feelings associated with the event, and coping strategies and
long term goals. The apps also highlighted that those bereaved by suicide may be at increased
risk for suicide themselves, and encouraged seeking support if suicide ideation was present.
Follow-up strategies.
Finally, one app contained content specifically targeted at support-
ing someone who survived a suicide attempt. In addition to a safety plan, this app provided an
appointment reminder function, which was coded as ongoing contact/outreach (S16). No apps
addressed adherence management (S17) or peer support (S18) following a suicide attempt.
Safety plans.
As discussed above, many suicide prevention tools were incorporated into
apps as part of a safety plan (S14). Safety plans were one of the most prevalent app features,
with 14 apps (13 suicide-specific) enabling users to create a plan.
Half of these safety plan apps (seven apps, six suicide-specific apps) allowed users to identify
lethal means that they should remove from their environment in a crisis (S1). All safety plan
apps allowed users to identify peer supporters who could be contacted in a crisis situation (S7).
Additionally, 10 of the apps connected to the user’s contact/address book, enabling users to
contact peers from within the app (all 10 apps), and facilitating the input of contacts by import-
ing their details from the address book (five apps). In addition to peer support, 11 safety plan
apps (ten suicide-specific) included details of non-crisis support services (S9) including psychi-
atrists, psychologists, mental health organisations and service providers, and general practi-
tioners. All of these apps allowed users to enter their own contacts, and one app additionally
assisted users in finding the nearest mental health resource based on location data obtained

 from the phone handset. Crisis support information (S10) was available within six of the apps
(all suicide-specific) and was similar to non-crisis support, allowing users to input relevant cri-
sis support line information. However, one app additionally prompted the user to call a
national crisis support centre if pre-nominated warning signs were selected.
Safety plans also contained components not otherwise coded in the description above. Just over
half of the safety plan apps (eight apps, seven suicide specific) included a section for users to identify
their individual warning signs for a crisis, with two apps (both suicide-specific), also allowing users
to actively identify personal triggers. All 14 apps had a section for users to record coping strategies
to ameliorate these factors, either allowing the user to enter their own strategies (12 apps), or allow-
ing the user to listen to music or meditation tracks as a means of relaxation (two apps).
In addition to specific means access restriction, an additional six apps featured sections for
making the user’s environment generally safer and more comfortable, for example by not being
alone. Four apps allowed users to nominate distracting places to go to in a crisis, such as social
environments. Finally, seven apps encouraged users to record details associated with medium
and longer term life planning, or reasons to live.
Synthesis of results
Ten distinct suicide prevention strategies were identified within the reviewed apps, one of
which was associated with good evidence at level E1 (see Table 1). Five strategies were associ-
ated with secondary evidence (E2), three with concordance with best practice guidelines (E3),
and one for which no relevant evidence could be identified (E4).
Within the 49 apps, 94 individual interactive components were identified. Thirteen compo-
nents (13.8%) were coded with E1 evidence, 46 (48.9%) were coded as E2, 34 (36.2%) were
coded as E3, and one component (1.1%) had no relevant evidence (E4). Sixty individual com-
ponents were identified in the 24 suicide-specific apps: 10 (16.7%) at E1, 28 (46.7%) at E2, 21
(35.0%) at E3, and one (1.7%) at E4.
Aggregating these results to the app-level, accounting for multiple components within each
app and the evidence-based components within safety plans, 13 apps (26.5%; 10 suicide-specific,
41.7%) contained at least one element with some degree of evidence from the WHO report (E1).
A further 28 apps (12 suicide-specific) contained at least one component with evidence from the
literature reviews (E2), and the remaining eight interactive apps (two suicide-specific) contained
at least one element which follows best-practice guidelines (E3). None of the reviewed apps were
completely absent of components consistent with evidence or best practice.
Excluding the safety plan apps, a mean of 1.1 (range: 1–2) identified suicide prevention
strategies were found in each app. Safety plan apps, which inherently contain multiple compo-
nents, contained a mean of 3.9 (range: 2–6) components.
Within the 13 apps that contained the one identified high quality strategy coded as E1, the
most comprehensive app was a safety plan app [29]. Overall, the most comprehensive app was
also a safety plan app [30]. Both these apps were available for Android only. Outwith the safety
plan apps, no apps which contained crisis contacts (E1) contained any other coded suicide pre-
vention strategies.
Discussion
Summary of evidence
This review has examined app store descriptions for 856 unique apps, the in-app content of
123 apps, and evidence for interactive suicide prevention strategies within 49 apps. Overall,
providing access to crisis support services was the only strategy included within apps with E1
level evidence, with approximately a quarter of apps providing this feature. A further half of

 the apps were consistent with strategies identified in previous evidence reviews, and all apps
contained elements consistent with at least best practice guidelines. A small number of apps
with potentially harmful content were also identified during the review process.
Twenty-four apps focussing specifically on suicide prevention were identified, all of which
included features broadly concordant with the evidence base. This degree of concordance is
higher than observed in reviews of other physical and mental health apps, and possibly reflects
a higher degree of involvement from professional institutions in app development. For exam-
ple, Nicholas et al. found that only 4% of apps for bipolar disorder were developed by institu-
tions [12], and similarly Shen et al. reported that universities and institutions accounted for
only 4.2% of developers of depression-related apps [13]. In contrast, institutions accounted for
approximately half of developers of the reviewed suicide prevention apps. This potentially
accounts for the difference in the proportion of apps that are evidence-informed between the
current study and other mental health areas. This may also explain the reasonable provision of
duty of care embedded within the relevant suicide prevention strategies. Most apps which
offered self-screening tools alerted users towards help seeking options if risk of suicidality was
detected, although the suggestion was not always direct or immediate. Apps which allowed
users to interact with one another also contained content moderation, which is important con-
sidering the potential for sharing potentially harmful content.
Despite the involvement of academic and healthcare institutions in their development, rela-
tively few suicide prevention apps contained broader markers of app quality, such as referenc-
ing of source material. Indeed, a review by Aguirre et al. [21], specifically of suicide prevention
apps, sought to review the evidence base of the content, however found it not possible due to
the lack of information within apps indicating the provenance of the content. Apps also suf-
fered from a lack of privacy policies, locking and protecting of apps, and reliability. These defi-
ciencies may influence consumer and professional confidence in these apps.
The components contained within the reviewed apps covered a broad range of suicide pre-
vention content, with the strongest emphasis on safety planning and getting help in a crisis.
However, the vast majority of apps only featured one interactive component. Given that the
WHO report indicates good evidence for multifaceted suicide prevention strategies, the lack of
comprehensive app-based support via the inclusion of numerous tool-based components rep-
resents a missed opportunity. Therefore, there is considerable scope for increasing the compre-
hensiveness of apps for suicide prevention. This could include targeted crisis support for
individuals, including immediate access to support services through the app, and an active
safety plan (despite the lack of clear evidence for this, it remains best practice and a prudent
inclusion). Secondarily, non-crisis tools could include identifying suicide risk factors and trig-
gers, and the delivery of psychological interventions.
In addition to increasing the number of components offered, there is also a need for greater
coverage of specific suicide prevention strategies that were missing or under-represented in the
reviewed apps. While it may not be feasible to deliver large, public health strategies, pharmaco-
therapy, or physical therapy through an app, there is room for development of apps to deliver
psychotherapy specifically for suicide prevention, improved physician-led screening for suicid-
ality and wider risk factors, and for assertive follow-up following a suicide attempt. Although
these strategies lacked the highest grade of evidence, there was some evidence in the literature.
It is perhaps reassuring that there are a number of suicide prevention apps already publicly
available to support individuals who may be in crisis, and that the interactive components gen-
erally follow best practice guidelines and strategies for which there is at least some degree of
evidence. The identification of these good-quality apps, however, remains a challenge. Just
under 90% of the apps identified in the app stores contained no suicide prevention strategies,
and some contained potentially harmful content. With no regulation in the app marketplace, it

 currently falls on clinicians and consumers to delineate app quality. Therefore app developers
have a challenge in not only creating suicide prevention apps with evidence informed content,
but in dissemination strategies so that the app is identified and used by the target audience.
Limitations
There are a number of possible limitations with the current review. App stores allow publishers
to restrict distribution to particular territories, and therefore not all apps may be available glob-
ally. As app store searches are localised to one particular country, it is possible that some sui-
cide prevention apps were not found in the search of the Australian stores. However, an ad-hoc
search of the term “suicide” on the American, Australian, British, Canadian, French, and Ger-
man iOS app stores found 100% concordance, and no apps that were not available in each terri-
tory. This provides confidence in this review reflecting the global app market.
Unlike searches of literature databases, app store search results provide a static snapshot of
a dynamic marketplace. Apps can be updated at any time, removed entirely from the app
stores, or disappear from the search results due to decreasing popularity. As an illustration, an
ad-hoc search of the Australian iOS store at the time of writing found seven of the 149 apps
originally identified through the “suicide” search term were no longer available. This illustrates
a methodological challenge inherent in such reviews, as the results can only provide a snapshot
into the current offering of available apps. This can also be a challenge for clinicians recom-
mending an app, as there is no guarantee that an app will continue to be available.
Mapping of app components to the evidence base has been, to some degree, hampered by
the extent to which both apps and suicide prevention programmes adopt a multifaceted
approach. Identifying which features or individual components are effective is therefore a chal-
lenge. This is further exacerbated by a relative paucity of good quality evidence for specific sui-
cide prevention interventions that would be appropriate for inclusion into an app. As reported
by Leitner et al.: “the research literature has adopted a ‘scattergun’ approach. . . The evidence
base for any single form of intervention is therefore very limited” [17]. As there is a lack of a
gold standard for effective suicide prevention interventions, we adopted the WHO report as
that standard. Implementation of quality suicide prevention strategies, whether in app form or
indeed wider policy implementation, could benefit from standard guidelines.
Conclusions
Despite a lack of evidence in the literature, there are a growing number of apps publicly avail-
able for suicide prevention. Many of these provide no interactive features, representing a lost
opportunity to engage users in suicide prevention programmes. There are also a small number
of apps which, to varying degrees, present potentially harmful content–of greatest concern is
the encouragement to engage in risky behaviours such as drugs and deliberate self-harm to
manage a crisis. Of those that do provide interactive prevention content, there was limited con-
cordance with high quality evidence-based practice. However, all apps contained at least one
component that was broadly consistent with either known evidence or best practice guidelines.
While this represents a promising first step in harnessing apps to compliment suicide preven-
tion awareness and strategies, there is a need for suicide-prevention apps to move beyond best
practice into the delivery of genuine evidence-based practice with apps supported by empirical
data on their effectiveness at reducing suicidal behaviours.
