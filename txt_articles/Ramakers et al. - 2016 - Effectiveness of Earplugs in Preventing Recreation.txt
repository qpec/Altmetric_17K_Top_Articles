IMPORTANCE The incidence of hearing loss has risen in past years. Attendance at music
festivals and concerts may contribute to this increasing problem.
OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of earplugs in preventing temporary hearing loss
immediately following music exposure.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized, single-blind clinical trial was conducted
on September 5, 2015, at an outdoor music festival in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
Normal-hearing adult volunteers were recruited via social media. An exclusion criterion was
the participants’intention to wear earplugs. Of the 86 volunteers assessed, 51 were included
in the study. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned to a group using earplugs or an
unprotected group during a 4½-hour festival visit.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary study outcome was a temporary threshold
shift (TTS) on the audiogram, primarily for frequencies at 3 and 4 kHz. Secondary study
outcomes included distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) measurements and
claims of tinnitus using a questionnaire and tinnitus matching experiments.
RESULTS Of 51 participants included, 25 were randomized to the earplug group and 26 to the
unprotected group. Nine in each group (36% and 35%, respectively) were men, and the
mean (SD) ages were 27.3 (5.6) years in the earplug group and 27.0 (6.2) years in the
unprotected group. Baseline demographics were similar in both groups. The time-averaged,
equivalent A-weighted sound pressure level experienced was 100 dBA during the festival.
A TTS over frequencies at 3 and 4 kHz after exposure was seen in 4 of 50 ears (8%) in the
earplug group compared with 22 of 52 ears (42%) in the unprotected group (P < .001). The
relative risk for a TTS after exposure was 5.3 (95% CI, 2.0-14.3) for the unprotected group vs
the earplug group. The number needed to treat with earplugs for preventing 1 TTS was 2.9.
The DPOAE amplitudes decreased significantly more over the frequencies 2 to 8 kHz in the
unprotected group: the mean (SD) decrease in magnitude was 0.6 (2.8) dB in the earplug
group vs 2.2 (1.9) dB in the unprotected group (P = .04). Newly induced tinnitus following
sound exposure occurred in 3 of the 25 participants (12%) in the earplug group vs 10 of 25
(40%) in the unprotected group (difference, 28%; 95% CI, 3.6%-49.0%; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Earplug use is effective in preventing temporary hearing loss
after loud music exposure. The present randomized clinical trial adds proof to the scarce
evidence and knowledge on this topic, which is a growing global problem.

T
he prevalence of acquired hearing loss has risen in
past years. The US National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey found that the prevalence of
adolescents with hearing loss has increased by 31% in the 2
decades since 1988.1
An explanation for this trend is the increase in exposure
to recreational noise, such as visiting music venues (concerts,
festivals, and nightclubs). Attendees of these recreational
activities can be exposed to loud music with sound pressure
levels of approximately 100 to 110 dBA for several hours.2-5
This exposure is known to cause hearing loss.6,7
Short-term exposure to extremely loud noise (>140 dBA)
can lead directly to cochlear damage. This is referred to as
acoustic trauma and can consequently cause permanent hear-
ing loss.8 However, in most cases, noise exposure causes tem-
porary hearing loss immediately after exposure. Hearing loss
can be measured objectively by temporary threshold shifts
(TTSs) observed on audiograms. A TTS usually recovers sev-
eral minutes to hours after the noise exposure.9,10 After fre-
quentexposure,however,recurrenttemporaryhearinglosscan
ultimately lead to permanent hearing loss due to damage to
the outer hair cells (OHCs) in the cochlea; these hair cells play
a major role in the transduction of sound by the cochlea to the
auditory nerve.11 Dysfunction of OHCs can lead to a TTS, re-
cruitment, and loss of frequency selectivity.12 The function of
the OHCs can be mirrored in otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). A
prompt decrease in OAE levels is observed in cases of noise-
induced hearing loss (NIHL) due to OHC damage. Also, a sub-
jectivemeasureoftemporaryhearingdamageistinnitus,which
is commonly experienced after loud acoustic stimulation at-
tenuates;tinnitustypicallysubsidesafewsecondstoafewdays
after exposure.13
A recent prognostic study found that a TTS is the most
important factor associated with the development of perma-
nent threshold shifts.14 In a longitudinal cohort study, hear-
ing level thresholds increased under the influence of recre-
ational noise during a 4-year period.4 Several preventive
strategies against recreational hearing loss from music ven-
ues exist. These include using earplugs, reducing the dura-
tion of exposure, and keeping a safe distance from the music
source.15,16 However, the general willingness to use earplugs
in music venues by attendees is low.17-19 This reluctance is
partly owing to the lack of evidence and general knowledge
on the effectiveness of earplugs in protecting hearing and the
scarce availability of earplugs.15 A recent systematic review20
by our research group found only 1 randomized clinical trial
(RCT) on the efficacy of earplugs in concert attendees. That
RCT21 revealed lower differences in audiometric thresholds
after a concert and fewer TTSs in concert attendees who used
earplugs compared with unprotected attendees. Because that
study was a small RCT (n = 29) with audiometric assessment
as the only outcome, a larger, well-designed RCT with mul-
tiple objective and subjective outcomes is needed.
Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to assess
the efficacy of earplugs in the prevention of hearing loss in a
well-designed RCT using objective and subjective outcomes.
By adding more knowledge to the scarce scientific evidence
of their effectiveness, we aim to highlight the importance of
earplugs in an attempt to increase their use among people
attending music venues, thereby decreasing the incidence of
NIHL.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
This study was a single-blinded RCT conducted by the
research group of the Department of Otorhinolaryngology
and Head and Neck Surgery from the University Medical
Center Utrecht in association with Van Boxtel Hoorwinkels
(a hearing aid distributor), Oticon Medical, and MTV Ben-
elux. This study was designed and conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki,22 and an exemption of full
review was obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of
the University Medical Center Utrecht (WAG/OM/15/027141).
Participants provided written informed consent. The trial
protocol is available in the Supplement. We conducted and
reported the study following the CONSORT guidelines for
RCTs.
The study took place at an outdoor music festival in Am-
sterdam, the Netherlands, on September 5, 2015. Normal-
hearing volunteers were recruited via social media advertise-
ments.Participantswereofferedafreetickettothefestivaland
a €50 stipend after completion of the study and were eligible
for inclusion if they were 18 years or older. Exclusion criteria
were current ear problems (eg, otitis, otorrhea, the presence
of ventilation tubes, or perforation of the eardrum), the use
of a hearing aid or cochlear implant, previous ear surgery (ex-
ceptfortheinsertionofventilationtubes),theabsenceofDutch
or English language skills, and the intention to use earplugs
during the festival. The last criterion was specified because of
the ethical consideration that participants could be random-
ized into the unprotected group and thus would not be al-
lowed to use their own earplugs.
Intervention
Participants were randomly allocated to the earplug group or
the unprotected group using a web-based randomization pro-
gram (version 2008; Gerard E. Dallal, PhD, http://www
.randomization.com) (Figure 1). Block randomization (n = 10)
would lead to an equal distribution between the 2 groups in
Key Points
Question What is the effectiveness of wearing earplugs in
preventing temporary hearing loss immediately following loud
music exposure?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 51 normal-hearing
adult music festival attendees, 25 were randomized to an earplug
group and 26 to an unprotected control group. The relative risk for
developing a temporary threshold shift on the audiogram at 3 and
4 kHz after the festival visit was 5.3 for the unprotected group
compared with the earplug group.
Meaning Earplugs are effective in preventing temporary hearing
loss following music exposure.

casetherequirednumberofparticipantscouldnotbeachieved.
All participants in the intervention group used the same ear-
plugs (MTV Soundkeepr; Standt BV) with a reported noise re-
duction rate of 18 dB. All participants were assigned to par-
ticular time slots for their hearing evaluations. These
evaluations took place before and immediately after a 4½-
hour festival visit. The participants in the intervention (ear-
plug) group were debriefed on how to properly wear the ear-
plugs and were advised to keep the earplugs in place for the
duration of the 4½-hour festival visit. Finally, all participants
were strongly advised to avoid or only moderately use alco-
hol and drugs.
Hearing Evaluation
The primary outcome of this study was the presence of a
TTS on the audiogram after the festival visit. Secondary out-
comes were differences in tinnitus perception and the mag-
nitude of distortion product OAEs (DPOAEs) after exposure.
All evaluations took place in the adjacent MTV Studio. At
baseline, a questionnaire about demographics as well as the
history of sound exposure and otolaryngology-related prob-
lems was completed. Air conduction audiograms for the fre-
quencies 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz were performed by the
same audiologist (including G.C.) or audiology assistant for
both ears at baseline and after exposure in the same mobile
audiocabin (350 Series Maxi Audiology Booth; IAC Medical)
using an audiometer (AVANT A2D+; MedRx Inc) with a head-
phone (HDA200; Sennheiser Electronic Corp). When a par-
ticipant experienced tinnitus at 1 or both evaluations, audio-
metric tinnitus pitch and loudness matching was performed
in a separate audiocabin with the same equipment. Partici-
pants were asked to complete 3 visual analog scales for
pitch, loudness, and annoyance of tinnitus using a scale
from 0 (very low) to 10 (very high). The DPOAEs were mea-
sured at 18 frequencies between 2 and 10 kHz in both ears
with a DPOAE probe and dedicated software (Titan
DPOAE440 module and Titan Suite Software, version 3.2.1;
Interacoustics) at baseline and after exposure by the same
experienced researcher. We used the following protocol and
settings: level 1 (L1), 55 dB; L2, 65 dB; and a frequency ratio
(f1:f2) of 1.22. The frequencies measured were 2002, 2196,
2417, 2654, 2918, 3208, 3531, 3881, 4263, 4689, 5152, 5668,
6228, 6847, 7525, 8274, 9097, and 10 002 Hz because higher
frequencies are more prone to TTSs due to loud noise. The
database program OtoAccess (version 1.2.1; Interacoustics)
was used for the extraction of the DPOAE data in DP-grams.
After sound exposure, participants were asked to complete a
questionnaire concerning the use of alcohol and drugs, the
presence of tinnitus, and subjective hearing performance.
Sound Level at Festival and Calibration of Equipment
Two members of the research team wore calibrated noise
dosimeters (DC-112 with Capture Studio Editor Software;
CESVA) and visited the festival while the participants were
present (7 hours 27 minutes). All instruments were cali-
brated according to the corresponding ISO standards. The
background sound level in the audiocabins was measured
before and after the study with a sound level meter (Type
2250; Brüel & Kjær) and condenser microphone (Type 4189;
Brüel & Kjær) and was below the maximum tolerated levels.
Blinding
All investigators who performed the hearing evaluations
were blinded for the group assignment. The 2 investigators
who analyzed the data (G.G.J.R. and V.J.C.K.) were also
blinded. Participants were aware of their group assign-
ment after initial evaluations and before entering the
festival.
Statistical Methods
To detect a difference of 3 dB on the audiogram between the
study groups, with an SD of 2.5 dB, a power calculation with a
2-tailed α of .05 and a power of 95% showed that 20 partici-
pants were needed per group. To compensate for the ex-
pected number of withdrawals and loss to follow-up, 10 ad-
ditionalindividualswererecruitedpergroup,resultinginafinal
sample size of 60 participants. All data were normally distrib-
uted; therefore, we used mean values and performed para-
metric tests. Pure tone averages (PTAs) were computed for the
frequencies 3 and 4 kHz and for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz for both
ears. A threshold shift (presumed to be a TTS) was defined as
an average increase of 10 dB or more after exposure at 3 and 4
kHz in 1 ear on the audiogram. We opted for 3 and 4 kHz be-
cause noise damage is known to cause threshold shifts pri-
marily in these frequencies.5,10
Differences in mean values between the groups were
analyzed by the independent, 2-tailed t test and proportions

by the χ2 test. For differences between the values before and
after exposure within participants, the dependent, 2-tailed
t test was used. The relative risk for developing a TTS was
computed as the ratio between the risk for developing a TTS
in the unprotected group and the risk for developing a TTS
in the earplug group. The number needed to treat for pre-
venting 1 TTS was calculated by the inverse of the absolute
risk reduction. Mean DPOAE levels were computed for all
frequencies between 2 and 8 kHz and for the frequencies
between 3 and 4 kHz for both ears together.
In case of missing data, a complete case analysis was
performed in which missing data were excluded from the
analyses. An exception was the lack of approximately one-
fourth of the 3-kHz thresholds in baseline audiometry
owing to a failure to follow the protocol by one of the audiol-
ogy assistants. We decided to interpolate the 3-kHz thresh-
old in these cases by averaging the thresholds at 2 and 4
kHz.23 As a sensitivity analysis for the interpolated data, we
also performed a complete case analysis. All analyses were
performed on an intention-to-treat basis. SPSS, version
21.0.0 for Windows was used, and P < .05 was considered
statistically significant. The P values comparing audiometric
results were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure24 to control for the false dis-
covery rate.
Results
Characteristics of the Study
Participants were recruited between August 26 and Septem-
ber 3, 2015, and data were analyzed from September 10 to 16,
2015. As shown in Figure 1, 51 of the 86 volunteers who were
assessed for eligibility were included in the study. Twenty-
five participants were allocated to the earplug group and 26 to
the unprotected group; no participants were lost to follow-up.
As presented in Table 1, the baseline characteristics did not
differ between groups. Moreover, as evidenced by Table 2, the
baseline audiometry characteristics did not differ between
groups. For baseline DPOAEs, there was a significant differ-
ence in magnitudes between the 2 groups for 6847 Hz and
6228 Hz in the left ear (P = .02 for both); no other frequencies
differed at baseline.
The mean (SD) time spent on the festival grounds was 270
(29) minutes for the earplug group and 277 (27) minutes for
the unprotected group. The mean time-averaged, equivalent
A-weighted sound pressure level was 100 dBA. In the earplug
group, 12 participants (48%) spent 75% or more of their time
at music stages compared with 7 (27%) in the unprotected
group. None of the participants in the earplug group spent 75%
or more of their time situated less than 10 m from the music
speakers compared with 2 individuals (8%) in the unpro-
tectedgroup.Noneoftheabove-mentionedcharacteristicsdif-
fered statistically significantly between the groups. The mean
(SD) time between leaving the festival grounds and the start
of the objective hearing evaluation tests was 29 (15) minutes.
Missing Data
The 3-kHz audiometric thresholds were omitted in both ears
before the festival for 12 participants (6 in each study
group). In 2 participants, a single audiometric value was
missing for the left ear (for 0.5 kHz in 1 person in the earplug
group and for 6 kHz in 1 person in the unprotected group).
The DPOAE data were missing for 8 participants at baseline
and after sound exposure in 1 or both ears because of the
inability to conduct the test (5 participants in the earplug
group and 3 in the unprotected group); the available tips on
the DPOAE probe did not fit their small external acoustic
meatuses.
Primary Outcome
There were significant differences in the proportion of TTSs
between the 2 study groups. Specifically, a TTS was observed
in 4 of 50 ears (8%) in the earplug group vs 22 of 52 ears
(42%) in the unprotected group (P < .001). Table 2 provides
the mean thresholds before and after music exposure as well
as the differences. In the earplug group for both ears, the
mean thresholds increased significantly less after exposure at
3 and 4 kHz compared with the ears in the unprotected
group. For example, at 3 kHz in the right and left ears, mean
(SD) increases of 3.3 (5.5) dB and 2.1 (6.2) dB, respectively,
were observed in the earplug group. In contrast, more severe
elevations of 8.8 (6.1) dB in the right ear and 6.5 (6.1) dB in
the left ear were observed in the unprotected group. At 4

kHz, the threshold shifts for the earplug group were 1.4 (4.2)
dB in the right ear and 0.0 (5.8) dB in the left ear compared
with 7.9 (5.5) dB in the right ear and 7.1 (6.5) dB in the left ear
for the unprotected group. The increase in PTA of 3 and 4
kHz was also significantly lower in the earplug group for both
ears. The complete case analysis, in which all missing 3-kHz
audiometric results were deleted, also showed significant dif-
ferences between the earplug group and the control group for
3 kHz and the PTA of 3 and 4 kHz for the left and the right
ear. The relative risk for a TTS after loud music exposure in
the unprotected group vs the earplug group was 5.3 (95% CI,
2.0-14.3). The number needed to treat was 2.9: the use of ear-
plugs in 3 individuals at this festival prevented a temporary
hearing loss in 1 individual.
Secondary Outcomes
DPOAE Measurements
Figure 2 shows the DPOAE amplitude at baseline and after ex-
posure for the earplug and the unprotected group for both ears
combined. The DPOAEs in the earplug group did not change
following the festival visit except for 2 frequencies: 2654 Hz
(P = .04) and 2196 Hz (P = .002) for the right and left ears, re-
spectively. In contrast, the DPOAE levels in the unprotected
group decreased significantly for 22 of the 36 tested frequen-
cies (61%). In the unprotected group, essentially all magni-
tudes for frequencies between 2 and 3 kHz decreased along
with most of the frequencies between 3 and 6 kHz. The mean
(SD) DPOAE magnitude for frequencies 2918 through 4689 Hz
decreased by 0.3 (2.8) dB in the earplug group compared with
1.9 (2.2) dB in the unprotected group (P = .04). For all frequen-
cies between 2 and 8 kHz, the mean (SD) decrease in magni-
tude was 0.6 (2.8) dB in the earplug group vs 2.2 (1.9) dB in the
unprotected group (P = .04).
Subjective Outcome Measures
As indicated in Table 3, at baseline there was only 1 person in
theunprotectedgroupwithtinnitusperception.Afterloudmu-
sic exposure, there were 3 new cases of tinnitus among 25 par-
ticipants (12%) in the earplug group compared with 10 of 25
participants (40%) in the unprotected group (difference, 28%;

95% CI, 3.6%-49.0%; P = .02). There were no differences in the
objective and subjective pitch and loudness perception of tin-
nitus between the groups. Only 1 participant (4%) in the ear-
plug group vs 15 (58%) in the unprotected group subjectively
thought their hearing had deteriorated (difference, 54%; 95%
CI, 29.3%-70.8%; P < .001).
Discussion
This single-blind RCT assessed the effectiveness of earplug
use at music festivals in preventing temporary hearing loss.
We found that the proportion of participants with a TTS fol-
lowing sound exposure was only 8% in the earplug group
compared with 42% in the unprotected group. The difference
in threshold shifts was most evident for the frequencies 3
and 4 kHz. The DPOAE amplitude decreased significantly less
for the frequencies 2 through 8 kHz in the earplug group
compared with the unprotected group. In addition, a lower
percentage of participants had tinnitus following sound
exposure in the earplug group (12% vs 40% in the unpro-
tected group).
As in the present study, Derebery et al5 found a TTS in
either one or both ears in 33% of participants and decreased
DPOAE levels after a concert in 68%. That study, however,
was not randomized, and only 3 participants wore earplugs.

An RCT by Opperman et al21 investigated the effect of ear-
plugs during 3 concerts and found a smaller incidence of TTS
in participants who wore earplugs: 4 of 15 (27%) who wore
earplugs compared with 9 of 14 (64%) in the unprotected
group experienced a TTS. Those authors found significantly
lower differences in thresholds in the earplug group after the
concert for the frequencies 0.5, 3, and 4 kHz compared with
the unprotected group. Our study showed an incidence of
TTS in 22 of 52 ears (42%) in the unprotected group, which is
within the range of the above-mentioned studies. Our pro-
portion of TTS in the earplug group, however, is lower than
that described by Opperman et al.21 An interesting finding
was the opposite attitude toward earplug use in the study by
Opperman et al, who described their participants’refusal to
wear earplugs despite being offered free first-row tickets to a
sold-out concert.21 In our study, we had to exclude several
participants because of their explicit wish to wear earplugs.
This development may indicate that the attitude toward ear-
plugs has begun to shift.
A strength of this study is that it was a well-designed and
well-conducted RCT and the first, to our knowledge, to
evaluate noise exposure and hearing loss at an outdoor music
festival. Another asset is that we performed hearing evalua-
tions within half an hour of loud music exposure after par-
ticipants left the festival grounds. An additional advantage
was the use of multiple objective and subjective measures of
hearing loss.
A limitation of this study is that some audiometric data
were missing, especially at 3 kHz. Because the effect of
NIHL is seen on the audiogram primarily at the frequencies
of 3 and 4 kHz, interpolation of missing data may have
reduced the effects. However, our complete case analysis, in
addition to the interpolated data, showed similar results.
Other limitations of our study were the lack of the exact
level of noise exposure per individual and the possible
recovery of the TTS before the postexposure audiometry
was performed. In the earplug group, the exact duration of
individual earplug use and the individual noise reduction
rate per frequency of the earplugs was unknown. The indi-
vidual noise reduction rate relied on various user-related
factors, such as insertion of the earplug in the external
acoustic meatus. The last 2 limitations have probably led to
an underestimation of the preventive effect of earplugs.
Another disadvantage of this study is that it reports on only
short-term outcomes after sound exposure. It would be
interesting to analyze the effect of sound exposure on per-
manent hearing loss; however, a long-term controlled
follow-up study of music venue attendees is difficult to real-
ize both ethically and practically.
Conclusions
In this RCT, the proportions of participants with a TTS and
tinnitus were significantly lower in the earplug group com-
pared with the unprotected group. In addition, a significantly
greater decrease in DPOAE amplitudes was seen in the
unprotected group compared with the earplug group. This
RCT adds evidence that earplugs are effective in preventing
temporary hearing loss during high recreational music levels.
Therefore, the use of earplugs should be actively promoted
and encouraged to avoid NIHL.
