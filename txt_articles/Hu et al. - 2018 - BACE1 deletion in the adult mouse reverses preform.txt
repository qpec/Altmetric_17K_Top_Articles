INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is the most common 
age-dependent neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by 
the presence of amyloid deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, 
progressive loss of synapses, and severe cognitive dysfunction 
(Braak and Braak, 1997; Corriveau et al., 2017). Excessive ac-
cumulation of β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) is a widely recognized 
early event that leads to the development of AD pathologies, 
including impairments in synaptic functions at various sites 
(Malenka and Malinow, 2011; Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; 
Yan et 
al., 2016). Generation of Aβ requires β-secretase, also called 
β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)–cleaving enzyme 1 
(BACE1), which cleaves APP to release a soluble N-terminal 
fragment and a membrane-anchored C-terminal fragment 
(Hussain et al., 1999; Sinha et al., 1999; Vassar et al., 1999; 
Yan et al., 1999; Lin et al., 2000). Further cleavage of the 
C-terminal fragment by γ-secretase excises Aβ (Sisodia and St 
George-Hyslop, 2002; De Strooper et al., 2012). Genetic mu-
tations such as the K670M671 to N670L671 mutation (Mul-
lan et al., 1992) or the A673 to T673 mutation (Jonsson et al., 
2012) can either increase or decrease Aβ generation, result-
ing in early-onset AD or protection against developing AD. 
Mice completely deficient in BACE1 show nearly abolished 
Aβ production (Cai et al., 2001; Luo et al., 2001; Roberds et 
al., 2001), further confirming that BACE1 is an important 
target for AD treatment.
However, the use of BACE1 inhibition is not without 
concerns. Mice with BACE1 ablation exhibit abnormal as-
trogenesis, reduced neurogenesis, hyperactivities, impaired 
axonal growth and pathfinding, hypomyelination, altered 
long-term potentiation (LTP), and long-term depression, as 
well as defects in muscle spindles (see reviews in Vassar et al., 
2014; 
Yan and 
Vassar, 2014; Barão et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2016). 
These phenotypes appear to be related to the abolished cleav-
age of BACE1 cellular substrates such as neuregulin-1 (Nrg1), 
Jagged 1 (Jag1), close homologue of L1, seizure protein 6, and 
voltage-gated sodium channel protein β subunits.
T
o better understand how BACE1 inhibition in adults 
will benefit AD patients, we generated homozygous BACE1 
flox (fl) mice in which the BACE1 gene can be temporally 
and tissue-specifically ablated by inducible Cre/lox technol-
ogy. We bred BACE1 conditional KO mice (BACE1fl/fl mice) 
with ubiquitin-CreER mice, which express Cre-ER driven by 
the ubiquitin C promoter in almost all tissues after treatment 
with tamoxifen (Ruzankina et al., 2007). We found signifi-
cantly reduced BACE1 expression in adult BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER 
mice even before tamoxifen treatment, and ∼50% deletion 
of BACE1 occurred after postnatal day 60 (P60). Hence, 
the 5xFAD mouse model was chosen for this study because 
of the development of amyloid plaques after P60 in this 
model (Oakley et al., 2006). Strikingly, deletion of BACE1 
in adult 5xFAD mice showed a remarkable reversal of amy-
loid deposition. T
o our knowledge, this is the first evidence 
that amyloid plaques can be completely reversed by gradual 
deletion of BACE1 beginning in early developmental stages. 
More importantly, the reversal of amyloid deposition in this 
AD mouse model significantly reduced neuronal loss, and 
cognitive functions were improved. Hence, this knowledge 
provides a strong foundation for the concept that BACE1 
BACE1 initiates the generation of the β-amyloid peptide, which likely causes Alzheimer’s disease (AD) when accumulated 
abnormally. BACE1 inhibitory drugs are currently being developed to treat AD patients. To mimic BACE1 inhibition in adults, 
we generated BACE1 conditional knockout (BACE1fl/fl) mice and bred BACE1fl/fl mice with ubiquitin-CreER mice to induce 
deletion of BACE1 after passing early developmental stages. Strikingly, sequential and increased deletion of BACE1 in an 
adult AD mouse model (5xFAD) was capable of completely reversing amyloid deposition. This reversal in amyloid deposition 
also resulted in significant improvement in gliosis and neuritic dystrophy. Moreover, synaptic functions, as determined by 
long-term potentiation and contextual fear conditioning experiments, were significantly improved, correlating with the re-
versal of amyloid plaques. Our results demonstrate that sustained and increasing BACE1 inhibition in adults can reverse 
amyloid deposition in an AD mouse model, and this observation will help to provide guidance for the proper use of BACE1 
inhibitors in human patients.

inhibitors should be administered to humans as early as pos-
sible to prevent or reverse amyloid deposition. However, we 
also demonstrate that caution is warranted, as BACE1 itself is 
required for optimal cognitive functions.
RESULTS
BACE1 deletion in the adult mouse precludes 
early developmental defects
To generate BACE1 conditional KO mice, we designed a 
targeting vector with two loxP sites flanking exon 2 of the 
BACE1 gene (Fig. S1, A–C). After F1 founder mice were 
identified, we crossed them with the flippase (FLP) deleter 
strain Tg-ACT 
FLPe to delete the FRT-flanked neomycin 
resistance (Neo) cassette and to obtain the final conditional 
BACE1fl/fl mice. BACE1fl/fl mice in C57BL/6J background 
were generated by crossing with C57BL/6J mice for over six 
generations and were maintained for subsequent functional 
and phenotypic analyses. By visual inspection, we noted that 
BACE1fl/fl mice grew normally and showed no visible differ-
ences compared with 
WT C57BL/6J mice. 
Western blot anal-
yses confirmed no significant alterations in BACE1 expression 
when no Cre-recombinase gene was introduced (Fig. S1 D).
We then crossed BACE1fl/fl mice with UBC-Cre/ERT2 
mice (007001; Jackson Laboratory), which presumably ex-
press Cre-ER driven by the ubiquitin C promoter in broad 
cell populations when treated with tamoxifen (Ruzankina et 
al., 2007). In our initial examination of BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER 
mice, we surprisingly discovered that expression of BACE1 in 
protein lysates from 2- and 4-mo-old mice was significantly 
reduced in BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER mice, even before tamoxifen 
treatment, suggesting a potential leakage of Cre expression 
in the UBC-Cre/ERT2 driver mice. Because leaked expression 
of Cre in this driver line of mice has never been reported 
in the literature, we then bred UBC-Cre/ERT2 mice with a 
Cre reporter line R26R (Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1Sor/J) to mon-
itor Cre-mediated (β-galactosidase) LacZ expression during 
development. We showed that LacZ was sparsely detected in 
the cortex and hippocampus beginning at the age of P45 in 
UbcCreER/R26R mice and reached broad neuronal expres-
sion at the age of P90 (Fig. 1 A). Further confocal staining 
confirmed that expression of β-galactosidase in UbcCreER/
R26R mice was mainly in neurons and was not obviously 
observed in microglia or astrocytes (Fig. 1 B). β-Galactosidase 
was detected in neurons from broad brain regions, but only 
weakly in the lung (Fig. S2). This observation suggests that 
BACE1 deletion in BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER mice can be attained 
in the adult even without tamoxifen treatment.
BACE1 expression and activity are well correlated with 
cleavage of its cellular substrates (Yan, 2017). We showed 
that BACE1 levels were not visibly different between P7 
BACE1fl/fl and BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER mice (Fig. 2 A), consistent 
with the aforementioned LacZ reporter expression. Levels of 
its substrates such as Jag1 were not significantly altered, and its 
downstream signaling molecules such as Notch intracellular 
domain and brain lipid–binding protein (BLBP) were also not 
visibly altered. BACE1 substrate type I Nrg1 was not detect-
able at this age. At the age of P20, BACE1 levels were also 
similar: Nrg1 was expressed, but levels of full-length Nrg1 
were not significantly altered (see quantitative comparisons in 
Fig. 2 B). At this age, myelination was active, and myelin pro-
teins such as myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid pro-
tein (PLP) were strongly expressed, but no significant changes 
in either of these two proteins were detected.
With the growth of mice to P30 and P60, BACE1 lev-
els were reduced in BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER mice compared with 
BACE1fl/fl littermates, reaching ∼50% at P60. However, at 
P120, BACE1 levels were reduced by ∼80% (Fig. 2 C), re-
flecting a continuing expression of Cre at later ages. This 
significant reduction also caused a corresponding elevation 
in full-length Nrg1 as a result of decreased cleavage. Conse-
quently, less Nrg1 bound to ErbB receptors to transmit sig-
nals, and thus, expression of downstream molecules such as 
MBP and PLP was decreased (Fig. 2, A and B). These results 
confirmed sequential and increased deletion of BACE1 in 
BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER mice in an age-dependent manner.
Although cleavage of Nrg1 was reduced, and levels of 
MBP and PLP were decreased, we found no significant im-
pact of reduced Nrg1 signaling on myelin sheath thickness 
in adult BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER mice (an example of 5-mo-old 
nerves is shown in Fig. S3), likely as a result of passing a crit-
ical developmental stage for myelination. Unlike that seen in 
the BACE1-null dentate gyrus, we found no visible changes 
in astrogenesis in P30 and P60 BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER mice (Fig. 
S4) when compared with BACE1fl/fl littermates, consistent 
with the important role of Jag-Notch signaling for the con-
trol of neurogenesis and astrogenesis in early developmen-
tal stages. T
ogether, these data show that sequential deletion 
of BACE1 after early developmental stages avoids develop-
mental defects that are normally observed in mice with ger-
mline deletion of BACE1.
Sequential deletion of BACE1 reverses neuritic 
plaques in a 5xFAD mouse model
Because BACE1 was largely deleted after P90, we then chose 
to cross BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER mice with 5xFAD mice, which 
begin to develop amyloid plaques at the age of P75 as a re-
sult of the overexpression of familial APP and PS1 mutations 
(Oakley et al., 2006). Amyloid plaques initially develop in 
the subiculum and gradually spread to other hippocampal 
and broad cortical regions. We first obtained BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD 
mice to breed them with BACE1fl/fl/UbeCrcER mice. The ob-
tained BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice were compared with 
 
BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD mice for amyloid plaque development. We 
showed that both genotypes of mice (BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD and 
BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD) developed amyloid plaques at P75 at 
a comparable rate (Fig. 3 A), indicating no obvious effect of 
the small reduction in BACE1 on the formation of amyloid 
plaques. However, a clearer disparity developed with increas-
ing age. BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD mice exhibited significantly increased 
plaque loads in an age-dependent manner and reached a high

density of plaques in the frontal cortex and hippocampus at 
P300 (Fig. 3 A). Plaque loads in BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice 
were greater at P120 than at P75, indicating a clear growth 
of plaque density during this period. Strikingly, the plaque 
load was decreased at P190 and was essentially undetectable at 
P300, suggesting a reversal of amyloid deposition when addi-
tional BACE1 was deleted. Further quantification confirmed 
that BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD mice had 31.7 ± 4.9 amyloid plaques in 
the cortex at P75, whereas BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice had 
24 ± 4.6 amyloid plaques in comparable regions (Fig. 3 B). 
With increasing age, BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD mice continuously ac-
cumulated more cortical amyloid plaques: 313.3 ± 48.2 at 
the age of P120, 444.9 ± 22.1 at the age of P190, and 778.5 
± 8.2 at the age of P300 (n = 6 mice in each age group). 
Comparably, BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice at the age of P120 
had 115.9 ± 10.7 amyloid plaques, which was 63% less than 
BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD mice but was still significantly higher than 
the numbers of amyloid plaques at the age of P75. However, 
with the continuing deletion of BACE1, amyloid plaque load 
at the age of P190 and P300 was reduced to 6.7 ± 4.6 in 
P190 BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice and was barely visible in 
P300 BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice (Fig. 3 B; n = 6 pairs; 
**, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; Student’s t test). Plaque reduc-
tion in the BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD hippocampus was on a 
similar scale (Fig. 3 C).
We 
also 
conducted 
biochemical 
analyses 
of 
APP-processing products. The mean reduction of BACE1 
reached ∼40% at P30 (Fig. 4 A) and was >50% at P75 in 
BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice (Fig. 4, A and quantifica-
tion in B). We found that BACE1 conditional deletion at 
P75 had a relatively weak effect on APP-C99, which is a 
BACE1-cleaved APP C-terminal fragment detected by both 
antibodies A8717 (recognizing the APP C terminus) and 
6E10 (recognizing the N-terminal end of Aβ; Fig. 4 A). The 
reduction of APP-C99 generation was highly correlated with 
BACE1 reduction, showing a more significant reduction after 
P120 compared with control littermates, and was essentially 
undetectable in P300 BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice (Fig., 4 
A and B). Intriguingly, an increase in APP-C83, which is the 
product of APP cleavage by α-secretase, appeared to be in-
versely correlated with the reduction of C99 at early time 
points (P75) but was significantly reduced concomitantly 
with the loss of C99 in older BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice, 
especially at P300 (Fig. 4 A).
Quantification of Aβ by ELI 
SA showed consis-
tent results: an age-dependent sequential increase in Aβ40 
(Fig. 4 C) and Aβ42 (Fig. 4 D) in BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD mice 
and a sequential reduction in both Aβ40 and Aβ42 in older 
 
BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice. At the age of P300, the reduc-
tions in 
Aβ40 and 
Aβ42 were by ∼97% and ∼97.5%, respectively, 
consistent with the essentially abolished amyloid plaques in 
P300 BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice. Collectively, these re-
sults demonstrate that significant and sequential inhibition 
of BACE1 in an age-dependent manner completely reverses 
amyloid deposition in the late adult stage. T
o our knowledge, 
this is the first observation of such a dramatic reversal of amy-
loid deposition in any study of AD mouse models.
Decreased amyloid deposition reverses gliosis and dystrophic 
neurites in a 5xFAD mouse model
T
o determine whether sequential deletion of BACE1 af-
fects gliosis, we examined fixed brain sections with Iba1 
antibody to label microglia. We showed that activated mi-
croglia, as labeled by Iba1, were correlated with amyloid 
plaque density (Fig. S5, A–C) and that activated microglia 
were clearly associated with amyloid plaques (Fig. 5 A). In 
 
BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice, levels of activated microglia 
with clear ramified and amoeboid morphology were smaller 
at P75 but were significantly greater at P120 and returned 
to barely detectable levels at P300 (Fig. 5 A and Fig. S5 C), 
suggesting that their activation is reversible and is correlated 
with amyloid deposition. In parallel, the density of reactive as-
trocytes, as labeled by Smi22 for glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP), was also correlated with amyloid plaque loads: It was 
low at P75, higher at P120, and returned to resting levels at 
P300 BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD (Fig. 5 B).
We also examined dystrophic neurites labeled by reticu-
lon-3 (RTN3) or ubiquitin antibody. RTN3-immunoreactive 
dystrophic neurites (RIDNs) were readily observed sur-
rounding amyloid plaques beginning in P75 BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD 
mice (Fig. 5 C). Ubiquitin-labeled dystrophic neurites were 
not yet detectable at this age but were visible at older ages 
(Fig. S5 D). Noticeably, dispersed RIDNs were not evident 
at P75 but were readily observed in both BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD 
and BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice at P120 (Fig. 5 C, arrows). 
Ubiquitin-labeled dystrophic neurites mostly surrounded am-
yloid plaques and were not in dispersed form, indicating the 
presence of two populations of dystrophic neurites and that 
RIDNs likely result from enrichment in RTN3-containing 
tubular ER (Sharoar et al., 2016). At P300, RIDNs (Fig. 5 C) 
and ubiquitin-labeled dystrophic neurites (Fig. S5 D) were 
essentially absent from BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mouse brains, 
in line with the abolished amyloid deposition. 
This is in con-
trast to P300 BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD mouse brains, in which neuritic 
dystrophy was more dramatic and exhibited a higher density 
of dispersed RIDNs (Fig. 5 C). Noticeably, dispersed RIDNs

sporadically remained in P300 BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mouse 
hippocampi. 
Together, these results show that a significant re-
duction in BACE1 activity in older 5xFAD mice not only re-
verses gliosis, but also significantly reduces neuritic dystrophy.

expression of BACE1 in BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER mice was examined at different ages (P7–P120). BACE1 substrates such as APP, Nrg1, and Jag1, as well as selected 
relevant downstream molecules such as Notch intracellular domain (NICD), MBP, PLP, and BLBP, were also examined in parallel. Molecular mass is indicated

tions, including impairments in LTP and cognitive functions 
(Malenka and Malinow, 2011). We recorded LTP on hippo-
campal slices prepared from four different genotypes of mice: 
BACE1fl/fl/5XFAD, BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER, BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5XFAD, 
and BACE1fl/fl. LTP was induced in Schaffer collateral–CA1 
synapses by applying theta burst stimulations (TBSs), and the 
amplitudes of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) 
were compared. BACE1fl/fl mice elicited a typical LTP lasting 
>40 min with 160.2 ± 8% of the mean fEPSP amplitude 
at 30 min after TBS (Fig. 6 A, blue line; 10 mo of age, n = 8 
slices). However, 5xFAD mice (BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD mice) exhibited 
significantly impaired LTP
, with a mean fEPSP amplitude of 
only 104.6 ± 2% at 30 min after TBS (Fig. 6 A, red line; n = 
8 slices; **, P < 0.01; Student’s t test), and this impairment was 
age dependent because younger BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD mice exhibited 
stronger LTP (Fig. 6 B, pink line; 4–5 vs. 10 mo, n = 8 slices). 
When amyloid plaques were removed in BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD 
mice, LTP in these mice was partially restored, with the mean 
fEPSP amplitude reaching 121.3 ± 4% (Fig. 6 C, black line; n = 
8 slices; *, P < 0.05 when compared with BACE1fl/fl/5XFAD mice; 
Student’s t test). This partial improvement was related to the 
deletion of BACE1 in the adult, as we found no differences in 
mean fEPSP amplitude between BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice 
and BACE1fl/fl/ubcCreER mice, which was 127.5 ± 6% in fEPSP 
amplitude (Fig. 6 D; n = 8 slices; P > 0.05, Student’s t test). 
The 
overlay of these traces showed clear partial impairment of LTP 
upon deletion of BACE1 in the adult (Fig. 6, E and F) when 
comparing the five different conditions.
Improved learning and behavior in a 5xFAD mouse 
model with BACE1 reduction
Although BACE1 deletion in the adult decreases LTP
, we ac-
tually found improved learning and memory as measured by 
a contextual fear conditioning test, which is one of the most 
commonly used paradigms to assess cognitive function in ro-
dents (Bach et al., 1995). In this experiment, four genotypes 
of 8–10-mo-old mice were subjected to the standard 3-d test. 
In the preconditioning test on day 1, mice were placed in 
the fear conditioning chamber and exposed to a sound fol-
lowed by a foot shock. There were no significant differences 
among the different genotypes of mice in the percentage of 
freezing time (Fig. 7). Context-dependent freezing was re-
corded on day 2 by placing mice back in the same chamber, 
but without exposure to the sound or shock. We found that 
freezing time was lowered in 5xFAD mice (Fig. 7; 35.47 ± 
4.75% in 20 BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD mice vs. 41.62 ± 4.51% in 15 
BACE1fl/fl mice, P = 0.23), consistent with the reduction 
in LTP exhibited in BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD mice. Freezing time in 
BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER mice was 42.16 ± 7.62% (n = 14), which 
was comparable with BACE1fl/fl mice and suggested no obvi-
ous impairment in learning and memory when BACE1 was 
deleted. Remarkably, a reversal in freezing time was seen in 
BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice (49.77 ± 4.32%; n = 25; *, P 
< 0.05; Student’s t test), indicating that removal of amyloid 
plaques improves performance on the contextual fear con-
ditioning test. On day 3 for the cue test, the freezing time 
in BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD mice was also reduced but did not reach 
statistical significance when compared with the other three 
genotypes of mice (Fig. 7). Thus, our behavioral tests indi-
cate an improved learning and memory after BACE1 dele-
tion in adult 5xFAD mice.
DISCUSSION
AD is widely regarded as a disease of synaptic failure asso-
ciated with age-dependent neurodegeneration. Abnormal 
accumulation of Aβ is an early event that leads to the even-
tual formation of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, 
and cognitive dysfunction (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). BACE1 
is a critical enzyme for Aβ generation, and BACE1 inhibi-
tors are being actively developed to treat AD patients (Vas-
sar, 2014; Yan, 2016). Ideally, BACE1 inhibitors should have 
manageable side effects, as BACE1 inhibitors are expected 
for long-term use. We developed conditional BACE1 KO 
mice for the purpose of deleting BACE1 at the adult stage to 
mimic inhibition of BACE1 in AD patients. Using this model, 
we investigated how BACE1 deletion in adults impacts the 
development of amyloid deposition and related pathological 
changes. In this study, we provide genetic evidence that se-
quential and gradually increased deletion of BACE1 not only 
reverses existing amyloid plaques, but also reduces gliosis and 
neuritic dystrophy and improves synaptic functions.
We showed that inhibition of BACE1 has multiple 
beneficial effects. Not only can it reduce Aβ generation and 
amyloid deposition, but it can also reduce levels of other po-
tentially toxic APP-processing products such as APP intracel-
lular domain (AICD). BACE1-cleaved C-terminal fragment 
(APP-C99) was previously shown to impair synaptic func-
tions (Tamayev et al., 2012), endosomal function (Kim et al., 
2016), and lysosomal-autophagic function (Lauritzen et al., 
2016). BACE1 inhibition clearly reduces APP-C99 produc-
tion in early stages, and its production is nearly abolished at 
later stages (Fig. 4). In P300 BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice, 
dystrophic neurites were significantly reduced (Fig. 5 C), 
in line with the reduction of both Aβ and APP-C99. No-
ticeably, in P300 BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice, we also ob-
served a clear reduction in APP-C83, which is produced by 
α-secretase cleavage of APP
. BACE1 and α-secretase are ex-
pected to compete to cleave APP to produce APP-C99 and 
which are indicated by red arrows. No amyloid plaques were observed in P300 BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice, whereas a high load of amyloid plaques was ob-
served in P120 BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice. Bar, 200 µm. (B and C) Numbers of 6E10-positive plaques in the cortex (B) and hippocampus (C) were quantified 
from six animals in each age group, and mean numbers per section are plotted for comparison (**, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; two-tailed Student’s t test). Plaque 
load was significantly reduced in BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice older than P120 compared with BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD littermates. Values are expressed as mean ± SEM.

-C83. Reduction in both products was unexpected, and the 
reason for this is not yet clear. One potential explanation is 
that it is caused by enhanced degradation of these fragments 
by improved lysosomal-autophagic function. An improved ly-
sosomal-autophagic function is likely to be beneficial for AD 
patients and should be investigated in more detail in the future.
Nevertheless, significant inhibition of BACE1 in the 
adult is not without concern. In BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice, 
we noted an age-dependent reduction in LTP (Fig. 6 B) and 
that impaired LTP reverted to a level similar to BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER 
mice, but not control levels in BACE1fl/fl mice (Fig. 6 E), in-
dicating that BACE1 in the adult is required for optimal LTP
. 
Our results also suggest that significant inhibition of BACE1 
in the adult is likely to have side effects associated with the full 
recovery of cognitive function in AD patients. As demonstrated 
in our study (Fig. 2, B and C), partial deletion of BACE1 im-
pacts cleavage of Nrg1, and this is likely related to the high 
affinity between BACE1 and Nrg1 (Ben Halima et al., 2016). 
BACE1 cleavage of Nrg1 releases its epidermal growth factor 
domain–containing N-terminal fragment, which binds to ErbB 
receptors in inhibitory neurons to control synaptic functions 
(Mei and Nave, 2014), and the deletion of BACE1 reduces this 
signaling capacity and likely alters synaptic transmission. Fur-
ther studies will be needed to elucidate whether Nrg1 or other 
BACE1 substrates are responsible for the partial reduction in 
LTP
. Despite this, we found that BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice 
appeared to behave normally in the contextual fear condition-
ing test. 
This difference between electrophysiological recording 
results and learning and memory behaviors is likely a result 
of multiple factors, which include the relatively young age of 
Figure 4. Sequentially increased deletion of BACE1 
reduces APP processing and Aβ generation. (A) APP 
processing products were examined by Western blot 
analyses. C99 is a BACE1-cleaved APP C-terminal frag-
ment, which was detected by both antibody 6E10 and 
A8717, which recognize the APP C terminus. Antibody 
A8717 also detects C83, which is a product resulting 
from α-secretase cleavage of APP. Antibody to β-actin 
was used to verify equal loading. Blot measurements in 
kilodaltons. (B) Relative levels of BACE1 in different age 
groups are plotted for comparison (equal to at least six 
animals in each genotype and age group). Significantly 
less C83 and C99 were observed in BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD 
mice compared with BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD mice beginning at 
P120. (C and D) Insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 from mouse 
hippocampal regions were extracted and measured by 
standard ELI 
SA methods (n = 6 pairs of animals; **, P < 
0.01; ***, P < 0.001; two-tailed Student’s t test). Values 
are expressed as mean ± SEM.

behaviorally tested animals and potential compensatory effects 
in BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice, as well as weak behavioral im-
pairments exhibited in BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD mice.
To our knowledge, this study provides the first evi-
dence that preformed amyloid deposition can be completely 
reversed after sequential and increased deletion of BACE1 
in adults. Partial inhibition of BACE1, i.e., by 50% in het-
erozygous BACE1 KO mice, is not sufficient to dramatically 
reduce amyloid plaques in all age groups (Sadleir et al., 2015). 
Although it is expected that BACE1 inhibition in our model 
will gradually decrease the production of Aβ, it is intrigu-
ing that amyloid plaques are actually cleared and removed 
in old BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice. Potential factors in this 
clearance are the effects produced by microglia. 6–10-mo-old 
BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice are still considered to be rela-
tively young, and microglia are fully functional in removing 
amyloid plaques, as demonstrated in a recent study (Daria et 
al., 2017). It will be interesting to test whether significant 
deletion of BACE1 in older AD mice will also result in clear-
ance of preformed amyloid plaques by microglia or whether 
additional components to enhance microglial function are 
required for full clearance of amyloid plaques. Enhanced ly-
sosomal-autophagic functions are postulated to contribute to 
the degradation of aggregated Aβ.
In summary, our data in this study show that BACE1 
inhibition has the full potential to treat AD patients if the

drug effectively crosses the blood–brain barrier and re-
tains high potency to inhibit BACE1 activity. More impor-
tantly, BACE1 inhibitors should be devoid of unwanted and 
off-target chemical toxicity, and such drugs can be used in 
humans for long-term use. Our data also suggest that sequen-
tial and gradual increases in BACE1 inhibition are likely to be 
the most beneficial for AD patients. Future studies should fur-
ther develop a strategy to minimize the synaptic impairments 
arising from significant inhibition of BACE1 to achieve max-
imal and optimal benefits for AD patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Generation of BACE1 conditional KO mice
The BACE1 gene contains nine exons spanning ∼24 kb on 
the chromosome 9 forward strand. For conditional deletion 
of BACE1, we generated a conditional BACE1 KO mouse 
(BACE1fl/fl mouse) by using the targeting vector having two 
loxP sites flanking exon 2 of BACE1. Exon 2 is a common 
exon for all BACE1 isoforms, and the region around exon 
2 does not include known regulatory elements. The target-
ing vector was confirmed by DNA sequencing, linearized by 
AscI digestion, and electroporated into C2 C57BL/6 embry-
onic stem (ES) cells, in which its 5′ arm (9.5 kb) and 3′ arm 
(8.3 kb) of homology underwent homologous recombination 
with the WT allele. Selection for homologous recombination 
was achieved by G418, which identifies ES cell clones that 
contain the Neo cassette present in the targeted allele. The 
Neo cassette is flanked with FLP recombinase target (FRT) 
sites to facilitate subsequent removal of the Neo cassette from 
founder mice (Fig. S1 A). Southern blotting using two differ-
ent probes (see diagram of WT allele in Fig. S1 A) was per-
formed to identify correctly targeted ES cell clones. A total 
of seven clones, confirmed by PCR genotyping with primers 
(forward: 5′-TCT

the 5′ loxp sequence (Fig. S1 B), were determined to contain 
the targeted allele and validated by Southern blot analyses 
(probes illustrated in Fig. S1 C). The verified ES cell clones 
were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and a total of 
10 chimeras were further bred for germline transmission of 
the targeted allele in the F1 generation, which was confirmed 
by both PCR and Southern blotting. F1 founders were 
further crossed with the FLP deleter strain Tg-ACT 
FLPe 
(003800; Jackson Laboratory) to delete the FRT-flanked Neo 
cassette to generate the final conditional BACE1 KO mice 
(BACE1fl/fl mice). For maintenance, mice heterozygous for 
BACE1-floxed allele (BACE1fl/+) in C57BL/6J background 
were genotyped by PCR with primers (forward: 5′-TCT

protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee of the Lerner Research Institute in com-
pliance with the guidelines established by the Public Health 
Service Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Mouse strains and breeding strategy
BACE1fl/+ mice were crossbred to generate mice homozy-
gous for the floxed BACE1 allele (BACE1fl/fl). BACE1fl/fl 
mice were bred with Tg (UBC-Cre/ERT2) mice (007001; 
Jackson Laboratory) to obtain mice heterozygous for the 
transgenic Cre and homozygous for the floxed BACE1 
(BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER) mice. BACE1fl/fl mice were bred 
with Tg (APPSwFlLon,PSEN1*M146L*L286V) mice 
(5xFAD; Jackson Laboratory) to obtain mice heterozy-
gous for the transgenic 5xFAD and homozygous for floxed 
BACE1 (BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD) mice. BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD male and 
 
BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER females were mated to generate 
 
BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD, BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD, BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER, 
and BACE1fl/fl offspring for this study. R26R (Gt(RO-
SA)26Sortm1Sor/J (003474) was purchased from the Jack-
son Laboratory. All lines were routinely backcrossed with 
C57BL/6J mice for at least five generations to ensure consis-
tent genetic background for phenotypic analyses.
Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy
Confocal experiments were performed according to standard 
methods as previously described (He et al., 2004). The mouse 
brain was surgically removed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde 
for 12 h, and immersed in 20% sucrose overnight at 4°C. 
Brains were sagittally sectioned (16-µm thick) on a freezing 
microtome (Microm GmbH). Sections were permeabilized 
with 0.3% 
Triton X-100 for 30 min. After being rinsed in PBS 
three times to remove detergent, the sections were heated by 
Figure 7. BACE1 deletion in the adult 5xFAD mouse model amelio-
rates learning and behavioral impairments. A fear conditioning assay 
was conducted for 3 d using standard procedures. There were no differ-
ences in the percentage of freeze time during the day 1 preconditioning 
test. On day 2, contextual fear learning and memory of the mice were an-
alyzed. Changes in total freeze time on day 2 are reflected in their contex-
tual learning ability. BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD mice (n = 20) showed significantly less 
freezing time compared with BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice (n = 25; *, P < 0.05). 
Day 3 measured tone-mediated cue memory by comparing freezing during 
the presentation of tones in a different chamber, which is more related to 
amygdala function, and no significant differences were noted among the 
four genotypes of mice. Values are expressed as mean ± SEM.

microwave in 0.05 M citrate-buffered saline, pH 6.0, for 5 
min, blocked with 5% normal goat serum, and incubated with 
individual primary antibodies at the following dilutions: 6E10 
(1:1,000; AB_662804; Signet), Iba1 (1:500; AB_839504; 
Wako 
Chemicals), SMI22 (1:1,000; AB_2313859; Covance), Aβ1-42 
(1:500; AB_2341375; IBL-American), Ubiquitin (1:1,000; 
AB_477667; Sigma), and R458 (1:1,000; Millipore; He et al., 
2004). The quality of the R458 antibody was confirmed by 
Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining by uti-
lizing RTN3 KO mice (Shi et al., 2014). After washing with 
PBS three times, sections were incubated with secondary 
antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 
568 (Molecular Probes).
Western blotting and antibodies
Protein extraction was performed according to previously 
described procedures (Hu et al., 2007). Brain samples were 
homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) 
buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium 
deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaF
, 
1 mM Na3VO4, and a protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) 
and centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 90 min. Equal amounts of 
protein were resolved on a NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) 
and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). 
Subsequently, blots were incubated with primary antibod-
ies (1:1,000 APP-C [AB_258409; Sigma]; 1:1,000 BACE1; 
1:200 type I Nrg1 [AB_2154793; Santa Cruz]; 1:200 Jag1 
[AB_649685; Santa Cruz]; 1:1,000 BLBP [AB_10000325; 
Millipore]; 1:1,000 Cleaved Notch1 [AB_2153351; Cell 
Signaling]; 1:10,000 MBP [AB_510039; Sternberger Mono-
clonals]; 1:2,000 PLP; 1:2,000 6E10 [AB_662804; Signet]; 
1:50,000 actin [AB_476744; Sigma]) overnight at 4°C. After 
extensive washing, blots were reacted with HRP-conjugated 
secondary antibodies and visualized using enhanced chemilu-
minescence (Thermo Scientific).
Quantification of Aβ peptides using ELI 
SA
Insoluble Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 were differentially prepared 
from the frozen hippocampus by the guanidine hydro-
chloride method (Shi et al., 2014). Levels of Aβ1–40 and 
Aβ1–42 in hippocampal samples were quantified by sand-
wich ELI 
SA according to previously described procedures 
(He et al., 2004). Results were obtained from six female 
 
BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD and six female BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD hip-
pocampal samples in each age group.
Quantification of amyloid plaque load
Quantification of amyloid plaques was conducted with serial 
sagittal sections, which were selected at 10-section intervals. 
Amyloid plaques were labeled with 6E10 antibody followed 
by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine visualization. Images were cap-
tured by a DMR microscope (Leica) with a charge-coupled 
device camera (Retiga-2000R; QImaging) using a 2.5× 
objective. Plaque numbers in the cerebral cortex and hip-
pocampus were counted using ImageJ software (National In-
stitutes of Health). Six female BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD and six female 
 
BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD mice in each age group were used.
LTP recordings
LTP recordings on hippocampal slices were performed ac-
cording to previously described procedures (Shimono et al., 
2002; Baba et al., 2003; Itoh et al., 2005). In brief, horizon-
tal hippocampal slices (350-µm thickness) were prepared 
from the brains of 10–12-mo-old BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER/5xFAD, 
 
BACE1fl/fl/5xFAD, BACE1fl/fl/UbcCreER, and BACE1fl/fl mice in ice-
cold, 95% O2/5% CO2 oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid 
consisting of the following ingredients: 124 mM NaCl, 3 mM 
KCl, 1.24 mM KH2PO4, 1.5 mM MgSO4, 2.0 mM CaCl2, 
26 mM NaHCO3, and 10 mM glucose. The prepared slices 
were incubated at room temperature for >1 h before recording. 
Slices were then placed onto the center of a MED probe (MED-
P515A; 
AutoMate Scientific) and perfused in 95% O2/5% CO2–
saturated artificial cerebrospinal fluid. The device had an array 
arranged in an 8 × 8 pattern of 64 planar microelectrodes across 
a hippocampal slice. Each electrode was 20 × 20 µm with an 
interelectrode distance of 150 µm. A SU-MED640 amplifier 
run by Mobius software was used for data acquisition and anal-
ysis. Schaffer collaterals to CA1 synapses were typically analyzed 
for LTP assays. fEPSPs caused by stimulation were recorded at 
a 20-kHz sampling rate. Control fEPSPs were recorded for at 
least 10 min before the conditioning stimulation. After a stable 
baseline was established, LTP was induced by TBS, which was a 
10-burst train of four 100-Hz pulses with 200-ms intertrain in-
tervals. Field potential amplitudes were then measured. Data are 
expressed as mean ± SEM. Synaptic strength was evaluated by 
measuring changes in the fEPSP amplitude relative to baseline. 
Pairwise statistics were calculated by Student’s t tests.
Contextual fear conditioning test
The standard contextual fear conditioning test is conducted 
over 3 d. On the first day, which was the conditioning period, 
the mouse was placed in the conditioning chamber (Med As-
sociates) for 3 min (phase A) before the onset of the sound at 
2,800 Hz and 85 dB for 30 s (phase B, conditioning stimulus). 
The last 2 s of the conditioning stimulus was coupled with a 
0.7-mA continuous foot shock (phase C, unconditioned stim-
ulus). After resting an additional 30 s in the chamber, phases 
B and C were repeated once, and the mouse was returned to 
its home cage after resting in the chamber for 30 s On the 
second day, mice were tested for their contextual memory in 
the same chamber for 3 min without either sound or foot 
shock. On the third day, mice were tested for tone memory in 
a different chamber environment with the sound but no foot 
shock. Fear memory was measured as the percentage of freez-
ing, which was defined as the percentage of time completely 
lacking movement, except for respiration, in intervals of 5 s.
Quantification of G-ratios
The myelinated axon circumference was measured by digi-
tally tracing the inner and outer layers of the myelinated fiber 
 939
JEM Vol. 215, No. 3
using ImageJ software. The G-ratio was calculated by divid-
ing the inner circumference of the axon (without myelin) by 
the outer circumference of the total fiber (including myelin). 
Three pairs of BACE1fl/fl/Nes-Cre and BACE1fl/fl mice were 
processed for the quantification of G-ratios.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Excel (Microsoft). All 
data values are expressed as mean ± SEM and were analyzed 
for statistical significance using an F–test for equal variance, 
followed by a two-tailed Student’s t test. Significant p-values 
are denoted by the use of asterisks in the text and figures
