Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Although numerous children receive methylphenidate hydrochloride for the 
treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), little is known about age-dependent 
and possibly lasting effects of methylphenidate on the human dopaminergic system.
OBJECTIVES—To determine whether the effects of methylphenidate on the dopaminergic 
system are modified by age and to test the hypothesis that methylphenidate treatment of young but 
not adult patients with ADHD induces lasting effects on the cerebral blood flow response to 
dopamine challenge, a noninvasive probe for dopamine function.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial (Effects of Psychotropic Drugs on Developing Brain–Methylphenidate) among ADHD 
referral centers in the greater Amsterdam area in the Netherlands between June 1, 2011, and June 
15, 2015. Additional inclusion criteria were male sex, age 10 to 12 years or 23 to 40 years, and 
stimulant treatment–naive status.
INTERVENTIONS—Treatment with either methylphenidate or a matched placebo for 16 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Change in the cerebral blood flow response to an 
acute challenge with methylphenidate, noninvasively assessed using pharmacological magnetic 
resonance imaging, between baseline and 1 week after treatment. Data were analyzed using intent-
to-treat analyses.
RESULTS—Among 131 individuals screened for eligibility, 99 patients met DSM-IV criteria for 
ADHD, and 50 participants were randomized to receive methylphenidate and 49 to placebo. 
Sixteen weeks of methylphenidate treatment increased the cerebral blood flow response to 
methylphenidate within the thalamus (mean difference, 6.5; 95% CI, 0.4–12.6; P = .04) of children 
aged 10 to 12 years old but not in adults or in the placebo group. In the striatum, the 
methylphenidate condition differed significantly from placebo in children but not in adults (mean 
difference, 7.7; 95% CI, 0.7–14.8; P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—We confirm preclinical data and demonstrate age-
dependent effects of methylphenidate treatment on human extracellular dopamine striatal-thalamic 
circuitry. Given its societal relevance, these data warrant replication in larger groups with longer 
follow-up.
TRIAL REGISTRATION—identifier: NL34509.000.10 and trialregister.nl identifier: NTR3103.
Methylphenidate hydrochloride is the most frequently prescribed medication for the 
treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It effectively reduces 
symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity in up to 80% of children with 
ADHD.1 Methylphenidate increases extracellular dopamine (DA) levels in the brain by 
blocking the DA transporters in the synapse.2 Its short-term safety has been documented in 
Schrantee et al.

 many studies, and its efficacy is among the highest of all psychiatric medications.3 However, 
despite its prevalent use among children and adolescents, little is known about lasting effects 
of methylphenidate on the developing DAergic system.3–5
The adolescent brain is a rapidly developing system that maintains high levels of plasticity. 
As such, the brain may be particularly vulnerable to drugs that interfere with these processes 
or modify the specific transmitter systems involved. The effects of methylphenidate on brain 
development have so far only been studied in healthy male animals,4,6 with short washout 
periods.7 More recent evidence indicates that psychotropic drugs affect the brain in a 
differential manner that depends on the age at exposure.5 Whereas long-term stimulant 
exposure in adult animals results in a temporary adaptation to the drug effects, more lasting 
(and sometimes permanent) alterations are seen when methylphenidate is administered to 
juvenile animals, a process referred to as neurochemical imprinting.5
Safety investigations on the effects of methylphenidate on DA function in the developing 
brain are scarce in children.7 Regardless of this alarming paucity of findings, increasingly 
greater numbers of children and young adolescents are exposed to methylphenidate, many of 
whom likely do not meet the criteria for ADHD.8 This heightened use has led to 
considerable debate and concern (eg, among parents) about the long-term consequences or 
possible adverse effects of methylphenidate use in children. Such knowledge is urgently 
needed, as recently emphasized by several entities, including the US Food and Drug 
Administration9 and National Institutes of Health10 and the European Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use.11
The primary aim of the Effects of Psychotropic Drugs on Developing Brain–
Methylphenidate study was to assess the effects of long-term methylphenidate treatment on 
DA function in children and adults with ADHD. We probed DA function using 
methylphenidate-based pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI), a powerful 
noninvasive technique to investigate DA function in vivo.12,13 Due to increased DA levels,14 
we hypothesized an increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) response to methylphenidate in 
children treated with methylphenidate for 4 months (with a 1-week washout) but no such 
lasting effects in methylphenidate-treated adults.
Methods
Trial Design
The Effects of Psychotropic Drugs on Developing Brain–Methylphenidate15 study was a 16-
week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of the use of 
methylphenidate and a blinded end point evaluation in stimulant treatment–naive patients 
with ADHD. The effect of age on the CBF response to a DA challenge and overall clinical 
outcome was assessed using phMRI in children and adults with ADHD, randomly assigned 
to either placebo or active treatment with methylphenidate, at baseline and after a 1-week 
washout (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). The trial protocol applied the code of medical ethics 
and was registered by the Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects (an 
independent registry) on March 24, 2011 (identifier NL34509.000.10) and subsequently at 
The Netherlands National Trial Register (identifier NTR3103), with enrollment of the first

 patient on October 13, 2011. In addition, the institutional review board of the Academic 
Medical Center approved the study. The full protocol is available in Supplement 2. The trial 
ended on June 15, 2015, and was monitored by the Clinical Research Unit of the Academic 
Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
All patients and parents or legal representatives of the children provided written informed 
consent.
Participants
Participants were 50 stimulant treatment–naive boys (10–12 years old) and 49 stimulant 
treatment–naive men (23–40 years old) diagnosed as having ADHD and recruited through 
clinical programs at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Triversum 
(Alkmaar, the Netherlands), De Bascule Academic Center for Child and Adolescent 
Psychiatry (Amsterdam), and PsyQ mental health facility (The Hague). All children and 
adults who were included met strict criteria for ADHD according to the DSM-IV16 and were 
diagnosed by an experienced psychiatrist (M.A.B.), which was confirmed with the 
Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (authorized Dutch translation)17 and the 
Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in Adults.18 Patients with comorbid Axis I psychiatric 
disorders requiring treatment with medication at study entry, a history of major neurological 
or medical illness, or a history of clinical treatment with drugs influencing the DAergic 
system (for adults before age 23 years), such as stimulants, neuroleptics, antipsychotics, and 
dopamine 2 and 3 (D2 and D3) agonists, were excluded. More detailed inclusion and 
exclusion criteria are available in the trial protocol (Supplement 2).
Intervention, Randomization, and Blinding
Patients were randomly assigned to either methylphenidate or placebo treatment (eAppendix 
in Supplement 1). The treating physicians (C.B. and M.A.B.) prescribed the study 
medication under double-blind conditions on clinical guidance (ie, reduction in ADHD 
symptoms) in accord with Dutch treatment guidelines. Adult participants received coaching 
sessions, and parents of children received psychoeducation. Adherence to the study 
medication was monitored at each of the 5 control visits (weeks 1, 3, 8, and 12 for children 
and weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 for adults).
Outcomes
Primary Outcome Measure of DA Function—We used phMRI to assess the CBF 
response to the DA challenge with methylphenidate. Pharmacological MRI is based on the 
principle that neurotransmitter-specific drug challenges evoke changes in neurovascular 
coupling and resultant changes in brain hemodynamics, such as the CBF.19 It has been 
shown to indirectly assess DA dysfunction in a noninvasive manner similar to positron 
emission tomographic and single-photon emission computed tomographic studies.12,13,20,21
The phMRI scan consisted of 2 sessions, one before and one 90 minutes after oral 
administration of 0.5 mg/kg of methylphenidate hydrochloride (with a maximum dose of 20 
mg for children and 40 mg for adults) acquired on a 3.0-T MR imaging system (Philips). 
Heart rate (HR) was determined using a peripheral pulse unit, and carotid flow was

 measured using 2-dimensional phase-contrast MRI. Pharmacological MRI assessment took 
place at baseline (week 0) and posttreatment after a 1-week washout (week 17) to ascertain 
drug clearance (methylphenidate has a half-life of 2–3 hours22). Arterial spin labeling 
phMRI was used to assess the CBF. The means of the CBF values in the gray matter of 3 a 
priori selected regions of interest (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1) (ie, striatum, thalamus, and 
anterior cingulate cortex) were used for statistical analysis. These regions of interest were 
selected because the striatum is rich in DA transporters (the primary target of 
methylphenidate) and because animal literature has demonstrated large phMRI effects of 
early methylphenidate treatment in the thalamus and anterior cingulate cortex.14 Data 
acquisition, postprocessing, absolute CBF values, exploratory voxel-based analyses of the 
CBF maps, HR, and carotid flow are described and shown in detail in the eAppendix and 
eFigures 3, 4, 5, and 6 in Supplement 1, respectively).
Secondary Outcome Measure of Clinical Assessment—Clinical change was rated 
using the Clinical Global Impression–Severity and Clinical Global Impression–
Improvement23 scores, both on a 7-point Likert-type scale. Response to treatment was 
defined as a score of 1 or 2 on the Clinical Global Impression–Improvement (indicating 
“very much improved” or “much improved”) and compared between groups at trial’s end.
Statistical Analysis
All primary analyses are intent-to-treat, with the significance level set at P < .05 (2-sided). 
To evaluate the effect of methylphenidate on the development of the DAergic system, paired 
t tests were used to assess individual change in acute CBF response after a methylphenidate 
challenge from baseline to posttreatment (Δi CBF) for all 4 groups separately. The effect of 
treatment on Δi CBF within both age groups was assessed using independent t tests. To test 
the interaction between age and treatment on Δi CBF, a 2-way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) was performed with age and medication group as factors. Missing values for the 
CBF (3.6% [14 of 392] due to dropout and 10.7% [42 of 392] in total) and clinical 
assessments (3.6% [14 of 392] due to dropout and 18.9% [74 of 392] in total) were replaced 
using nearest neighbor interpolation within age and medication group. For baseline 
characteristics and clinical outcome, a Fisher exact test was used for the analysis of 
categorical data, with odds ratio as effect size estimate (Clinical Global Impression–
Improvement), and t test and ANOVA were used for continuous variables (Clinical Global 
Impression–Severity and CBF), with normal distributions and partial eta squared (ηp2) as 
effect size estimate. Statistical analyses were conducted with a software program (SPSS, 
version 22; IBM). Sample size calculations are available in the eAppendix in Supplement 1.
Results
Randomization and Baseline Characteristics
Between June 1, 2011, and February 6, 2015, a total of 99 patients with ADHD in 3 Dutch 
centers were randomized to methylphenidate or placebo treatment. After randomization, one 
individual disclosed that he had been treated for ADHD with methylphenidate before and 
was therefore excluded from the statistical analyses. Fifty children and 48 adults were 
included in the primary analysis (Figure 1), although one individual was included at age 22

 years 5 months. Treatment groups did not differ in age, ADHD symptom severity, and 
clinical impairment (Table 1). No serious adverse events were noted in any of the individuals 
studied.
Treatment Assignment and Details
Treatment allocation and dropout rates are shown in Figure 1. Owing to unforeseen technical 
changes to the MRI scanner, 8 adults underwent the posttreatment scan at 8 weeks instead of 
17 weeks. The mean treatment duration did not differ between treatment groups in adults (P 
= .68) and children (P = .73).
Main Outcome of the CBF Response to Methylphenidate Challenge
Paired t tests indicated a significant increase (mean difference, 6.5; 95% CI, 0.4–12.6; P = .
04) (Figure 2) in the CBF change from pretreatment to posttreatment in the thalamus of 
children treated with methylphenidate and nonsignificant differences in the striatum and 
anterior cingulate cortex (mean difference, 5.7; 95% CI, −0.4 to 11.8; P = .07 and mean 
difference, 5.5; 95% CI, −0.1 to 11.1; P = .06, respectively), presumably reflecting increased 
DA levels. As hypothesized, treatment of adults with methylphenidate did not induce such 
an effect, nor did placebo treatment in either age group. Furthermore, striatal CBF values 
were also significantly higher (mean difference, 7.7; 95% CI, 0.7–14.8; P = .03) in children 
treated with methylphenidate compared with placebo, whereas no such treatment effect was 
observed in adults (Table 2). Finally, 2-way ANOVA showed a nonsignificant age × 
treatment interaction in the striatum (8.0; 95% CI, −0.3 to 16.3; P = .06) (ηp2 = 0.04). The 
difference in response to methylphenidate or placebo treatment in children can also be 
observed in the difference maps (eFigure 4 in Supplement 1).
Clinical Assessment
A repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant time × treatment interaction in children 
(P = .01, ηp2 = 0.21) and adults (P = .02, ηp2 = 0.20) on the Clinical Global Impression–
Severity scale (Figure 3), with the methylphenidate groups reporting lower global clinical 
impairment compared with the placebo groups. The methylphenidate group in children 
showed more improvement than the placebo group at week 3 (P = .03, ηp2 = 0.09) and week 
8 (P < .01, ηp2 = 0.15), whereas in adults this difference was only significant at week 3 (P 
= .01, ηp2 = 0.14) and week 17 (P = .01, ηp2 = 0.14). On the Clinical Global Impression–
Improvement scale, the proportion of patients who reported feeling “much improved” or 
“very much improved” (compared with baseline) 1 week after the end of the trial was 
significantly higher for the methylphenidate condition relative to the placebo condition in 
adult patients but not in children. The values in adults were 62.5% (15 of 24) for the 
methylphenidate group vs 8.3% (2 of 24) for the placebo group (odds ratio, 18.33; P < .001). 
The values in children were 12.0% (3 of 25) for the methylphenidate group vs 0% (0 of 25) 
for the placebo group (odds ratio, 7.93; P = .24).
Discussion
We studied whether age modulates the effects of prolonged methylphenidate treatment on 
the human DAergic system. After 4 months of methylphenidate treatment, we found 
Schrantee et al.

 significant increases in the CBF response to a DA challenge in the striatum and thalamus 1 
week after the end of the trial in treatment-naive children, suggesting lasting changes in the 
DAergic system. This effect was specific to children because placebo treatment failed to 
show such an effect in either age group, and active treatment with methylphenidate in adults 
had no effect either. In contrast, methylphenidate induced persistent clinical improvement in 
adults but not in children.
Our finding that methylphenidate treatment induces persistent increases in the CBF response 
to an acute challenge with methylphenidate in children is in line with preclinical phMRI 
investigations that report long-lasting increases in regional CBF in several DA-rich brain 
regions in juvenile rats treated with methylphenidate.14 Similarly, more invasive techniques 
have demonstrated that long-term methylphenidate treatment with clinically relevant doses 
causes long-lasting reductions in striatal DA transporters,24 expression of D3 receptors in the 
prefrontal cortex,14 increased DA levels,25 and a reduction in prefrontal neuronal excitability 
and synaptic transmission6 in juvenile (but not adult) rats. In humans, structural MRI 
studies26,27 have shown that stimulant treatment affects brain maturation, such that untreated 
children with ADHD show more rapid cortical thinning and smaller white matter volumes 
than children with ADHD receiving stimulant medication. Several positron emission 
tomographic investigations have compared on-medication and off-medication conditions in 
children and adults with ADHD. They showed mostly reductions in the CBF when off 
medication in motor and anterior cingulate cortices,28 somatosensory cortices,29 striatum,29 
and parietal areas30 in children. However, in adults, decreases were seen in precentral gyri 
and striatum but increased CBF in the vermis.31 In addition, an arterial spin labeling–based 
study32 reported reduced frontal and striatal perfusion in adults receiving ADHD 
medication. These findings are in line with our exploratory voxelwise analyses that showed 
reduced CBF after methylphenidate challenge (eFigure 4 in Supplement 1).
Preclinical evidence suggests that our present findings are mediated, in part, by changes in 
the expression of cortical D3 receptors. For example, juvenile exposure to methylphenidate 
induced a long-lasting decrease in D3 receptor messenger RNA in the medial prefrontal 
cortex.33 In rats, D3 receptor expression is high during early adolescence and then wanes 
until becoming absent in adulthood. Reduced D3 receptor autoregulation after early 
methylphenidate treatment causes DA levels to rise, which subsequently increases activity at 
other DA receptors. The D2 and D3 receptors have the highest affinity for DA. However, as 
extracellular DA levels increase, more binding to D1 occurs, inducing increases in the 
hemodynamic response.14
Because ADHD is associated with DA hypofunction,2 a lasting increase in DA 
neurotransmission—as evidenced by increased CBF values in response to an acute challenge 
with methylphenidate (which we found in methylphenidate-treated children only)—will 
likely result in positive effects on the clinical condition. However, this finding was not the 
case in the children in our cohort, with the positive effect of methylphenidate on clinical 
assessment during the trial waning after drug clearance. In contrast, adults in the 
methylphenidate group showed clinical improvement after washout, but there was no 
response difference in the placebo group at week 8, which is probably owing to the large 
placebo response as a result of coaching. Despite limited evidence for cognitive

 interventions in children,34 coaching has shown to be beneficial in adult ADHD both with 
and without additional pharmacological treatment.35–38 Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded 
that pharmacological treatment is less robust in adults than in children, and this hypothesis 
warrants further research.
Because maturation of several brain regions is not complete until adolescence,39 drugs given 
during the sensitive early phases of life may affect neurodevelopmental trajectories that can 
have more profound effects later in life.24 Indeed, the most comprehensive trial on the long-
term effects of ADHD, the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With ADHD,1 reported 
that 6 years after enrollment, medication management was associated with a transient 
increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression.40 This finding is in line with animal 
studies that reported increased anxiety and depression scores in juvenile methylphenidate-
treated rats41 and memory impairments.42 In addition, cohort investigations have provided 
evidence for age-dependent effects. For example, adult ADHD is associated with a high rate 
of substance abuse,43 but ADHD stimulant medication use in childhood does not increase 
this risk44,45 and may even decrease such vulnerability.46
A major strength of the present study is its design, such that the effects of confounders (eg, 
age and sex) are small. We chose to include only male patients to limit participant variation 
because girls and boys differ considerably in brain growth patterns39 and because ADHD is 
most prevalent in male individuals.15 The selective inclusion of stimulant treatment–naive 
patients was also critical for addressing our objective. Ideally, we would have used a longer 
washout period because the effects of drug exposure on the developing brain are 
hypothesized to be only fully expressed during early adulthood,5,24 and the present results 
indicate that such follow-up studies are warranted. However, for ethical reasons, the time 
that a child would not receive adequate treatment (placebo condition) dictated the length of 
this randomized clinical trial because the waiting list for treatment in the Netherlands was 
typically 4 months.
Our study had limitations. Owing to its complexity, the power of the study was limited, 
especially because we examined 3 different brain regions, which could have increased the 
risk of a type I error. Hence, our findings need to be replicated using a larger sample size 
with more statistical power. In addition, it is likely that the effects of methylphenidate are 
not confined to the regions of interest studied but likely affect DAergic projections 
throughout the brain, including other cortical regions.
Another potential weakness is that—despite its advantages and sensitivity, as discussed 
above—phMRI remains an indirect measure of DA function. It specifically assesses the 
hemodynamic response as a proxy of neurotransmission, and physiological effects could 
affect the hemodynamic response. For example, HRs differ between children and adults.47 
Although acute methylphenidate administration increased HR, it occurred in both children 
and adults. Moreover, we found no age × treatment interaction at baseline, nor did 
methylphenidate treatment significantly alter HR in either age group (eFigure 5 in 
Supplement 1). Therefore, although we did not find evidence for systemic vascular effects 
(eFigure 6 in Supplement 1), we cannot fully disentangle DA neurotransmission from direct 
effects of DA on the microvasculature.48
Schrantee et al.

 Another potential limitation is baseline differences in the CBF between children and adults. 
However, additional analyses assessing changes in relative CBF provided similar results 
(eAppendix in Supplement 1). Therefore, it is unlikely that the differences between children 
and adults are attributable to differences in HR or global CBF. Furthermore, previous studies 
have shown that time-course changes in the phMRI signal closely parallel microdialysis 
measurements of striatal DA release21 and correlate well with positron emission 
tomographic and single-photon emission computed tomographic measurements of DA 
transporter availability,12 DA release,13 and behavioral measures of DA dysfunction.12,13 
Pharmacological MRI investigations in rats5 further report data similar to the present 
findings. This collective evidence indicates that phMRI is ideally suited to noninvasively 
study methylphenidate effects in children.
Conclusions
In line with extensive preclinical data, we provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that 
methylphenidate treatment during a specific period of maturation alters the CBF response, 
likely reflecting increased DA neurotransmission due to neurochemical imprinting by 
methylphenidate. In the short term, these alterations do not induce major benefits or harm 
regarding clinical improvement, but the long-term consequences remain to be established. 
Therefore, our data stress the need for longer follow-up studies that address possibly 
progressive disturbances of the DAergic system and associated behavioral abnormalities.

 Key Points
Question
Are the effects of methylphenidate hydrochloride on the dopaminergic system in patients 
with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder modified by age?
Findings
In a randomized clinical trial of 99 male patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder, 4 months of methylphenidate treatment induced enduring effects in the cerebral 
blood flow response to an acute challenge with methylphenidate (a noninvasive probe for 
dopamine function) in children but not in adults.
Meaning
Methylphenidate has a different effect on the developing dopaminergic system compared 
with the matured dopaminergic system.

 Figure 2. Treatment Effects on the Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) Response to Dopamine Challenge
Shown are the means (SEMs) for the individual change in acute CBF response (Δi CBF) in 
the placebo and methylphenidate hydrochloride groups.
aP < .05 by independent t test comparing Δi CBF between the 2 treatment groups in the 
striatum (mean difference, 7.7; 95% CI, 0.7–14.8; P = 0.03, ηp2 = 0.09) (see also Table 2).
bP < .05 by paired t test comparing pretreatment to posttreatment Δi CBF within each group 
in the thalamus (mean difference, 6.5; 95% CI, 0.4–12.6; P = 0.04, ηp2 = 0.17).

 Figure 3. Treatment Effects on Global Clinical Impairment in the Methylphenidate and Placebo 
Groups
Shown are the means (SEMs) for Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scores at baseline, week 
3, week 8, and posttreatment (week 17). In children, we found a significant difference 
between treatment groups in the change from baseline to week 3 (P = .03) and week 8 (P = .
005) but not at week 17 (P = .06). In contrast, in adults, we found a significant time × 
treatment interaction at week 3 (P = .01) and week 17 (P = .01) but not at week 8 (P = .20).
aP < .05 comparing treatment groups on individual time points (by t test).
