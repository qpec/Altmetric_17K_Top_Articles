Objective: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) refers to the intentional self-inflicted destruction
of body tissue without suicidal intention and for purposes not socially sanctioned. Our
paper presents an up-to-date overview on nonsuicidal, self-injurious behaviors.
Method: In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature search was
conducted across two databases, PubMed and PsycARTICLES, regarding the main
features of NSSI with a focus on epidemiological and etiologic data, diagnostic criteria,
and functions. All English articles, published between 1998 and 2016, were considered,
and screened against a priori inclusion/exclusion criteria. The search terms include:
self-harm, self-injury, NSSI, epidemiology, comorbidity, gender, functions and DSM. We
also examined the references of the retrieved articles.
Results: NSSI is most common among adolescents and young adults, and the age
of onset is reported to occur between 12 and 14 years. Comorbidity with borderline
personality disorder (BPD) and eating disorders is often reported. DSM-5 includes NSSI
as a condition requiring further study. This review gives an overview of the prevalence
rates (7.5–46.5% adolescents, 38.9% university students, 4–23% adults) and main
causes that appear to stem from childhood trauma, comorbidity with many other
disorders and several functions of NSSI, and the potential independence of a NSSI
disorder.
Conclusion:
Over the years, interest in NSSI grew to such an extent that an
ongoing debate was instigated on whether NSSI should be considered as a diagnosis
in its own right and given its own category. This paper provides an up-to-date
overview on self-injury, what is known about it and what remains to be done. Clearly,
our understanding of the main issues of NSSI has increased in last two decades.
However, future researches is needed to examine the developmental trajectories, cultural
backgrounds and shed light on the risk factors and functions as well as clarify its role as
an independent diagnostic entity.
Keywords: deliberate self-harm, self-injury, nonsuicidal self-injury, NSSI, DSM-5
INTRODUCTION
Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) behavior is a growing clinical and public health problem. NSSI
is defined as the direct and deliberate destruction of one’s own bodily tissue in the absence of
lethal intent and for reasons not socially sanctioned (Favazza, 1996; Nock, 2010). Common forms
of NSSI include behaviors such as cutting, burning, scratching, and self-hitting (Briere and Gil,
 Cipriano et al.
Nonsuicidal Self-injury
1998; Laye-Gindhu and Schonert-Reichl, 2005; Whitlock et al.,
2006; Klonsky and Muehlenkamp, 2007) and most self-
injurers report using multiple method (Favazza and Conterio,
1988; Favazza, 1992). Evidences focused on the psychological
intentions underlying NSSI demonstrated that the behavior
serves a variety of function, both interpersonal and intrapersonal,
that are not mutually exclusive (Suyemoto, 1998; Nock and
Prinstein, 2004; Klonsky, 2007). Initial research on self-injurious
behavior focused on studies in clinical settings (Pattison and
Kahan, 1983), primarily with female subjects (Favazza and
Conterio, 1989; Favazza et al., 1989; Herpertz, 1995; Suyemoto
and MacDonald, 1995).
Epidemiological studies have endured due to the over-
inclusive definition of behavior, with and without suicidal
intent, as well as the dearth of consistent assessment measures.
Earlier estimates ranged from 40 to 82% among adolescents
in psychiatric inpatient settings (Darche, 1990; DiClemente
et al., 1991) and stated that ∼4% of the general population
have a history of NSSI (Briere and Gil, 1998). Most recently
researchers noticed that self-injurious behavior is more prevalent
even among adolescents and young adults. The first attempt to
describe this behavior can be seen in the book “Man against
himself ” by Menninger (1938), in which the author defined
self-injurious behavior as a sort of “partial suicide.” There
has been an absence of generally agreed upon terminology
and, over the years, several different terms to define self-
injurious behaviors have appeared in literature: syndrome of
delicate self-cutting (Pao, 1969), deliberate self-harm (Pattison
and Kahan, 1983), self-wounding (Tantam and Whittaker, 1992),
moderate self-mutilation (Favazza and Rosenthal, 1993), self-
mutilation (Ross and Heath, 2002); some of which include
suicidal behaviors, risk taking, and an indirect form of
self-harm (Favazza, 1996). The lack of consensus regarding
terminology and definition has made the understanding of such
behaviors very difficult. Self-injury is a common but—as yet—
poorly understood phenomenon (Klonsky and Muehlenkamp,
2007).
Self-injury has long been linked to other disorders as well,
including post-traumatic stress disorder (Briere and Gil, 1998;
Bolognini et al., 2003), depressive disorders (Darche, 1990),
obsessive-compulsive disorder (Bolognini et al., 2003), anxiety
disorder (Darche, 1990; Simeon and Favazza, 2001), borderline
personality disorder (BPD) (Klonsky et al., 2003; Nock et al.,
2006), and eating disorder (Iannaccone et al., 2013). Many
researchers and clinicians have argued for the adoption of a
NSSI disorder: some of the earliest attempts to define such a
syndrome being made by Graff and Mallin (1967); Pao (1969),
and Rosenthal et al. (1972). Those first attempted failed (Favazza
and Rosenthal, 1990) due to the inclusion of suicide attempts
in the definitions. Kahan and Pattison (1984) differentiated
self-harming behaviors from suicide and proposed a separate
diagnostic disorder: the deliberate self-harm syndrome (DSH).
Later, Favazza and Rosenthal (1990) suggested that habitual
and repetitive self-injurious behavior could be considered as
an impulse control disorder: the repetitive self-mutilation
syndrome. Muehlenkamp (2005) also proposed that repetitive
NSSI should be regarded as a separate diagnostic disorder. More
recently, Wilkinson and Goodyer (2011) proposed that giving
NSSI its own diagnostic category would improve communication
and increase research on etiology, its treatment and outcome.
There have been many arguments over NSSI, but given the
high prevalence of self-injurious behaviors among clinical and
community samples of adolescents (Muehlenkamp et al., 2012;
Swannell et al., 2014), and associated clinical and functional
impairment, the Childhood and Mood Disorders work-group
of the DSM-5 proposed the inclusion of NSSI as a separate
diagnostic disorder (Shaffer and Jacobson, 2009). Despite its
criteria undergoing several revisions, due to a lack of research
on the full set proposed criteria, inadequate sample size and
unacceptably low inter-rater reliability results in the DSM-5
field trials (Regier et al., 2013), the NSSI disorder (NSSID) was
only included as a condition requiring further study, in section
3 of DSM-5, and it represents an important step forward in
recognizing NSSI as a disorder in its own right (Selby et al.,
2015) and in promoting further research. Given the contrasts
and conflicting data present in literature on NSSI, the aim of
the present study is to systematize this broad field of research,
focusing on (1) proposed diagnostic criteria for the DSM-
5, (2) epidemiology, (3) comorbidity, (4) etiology, and (5)
functions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source and Search Strategy
The present study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA, Liberati et al.,
2009). PubMed and PsycARTICLES databases were searched for
eligible studies published in English between 1998 and 2016. The
following combinations of search terms were employed: 1. self-
harm OR, self-injury OR, nonsuicidal self-injury OR, NSSI, 2.
epidemiology, 3. comorbidity, 4. gender, 5. Functions, 6. DSM.
Additionally, we also examined the references of the articles
identified in the search.
Study Selection
Figure 1 shows the selection of included studies. In total, the
initial database search yielded 12340 abstract, of which 6356
duplicate were removed. Articles were first screened by title and
abstract by two independent reviewers. Of the remaining studies,
the full text was obtained and inspected independently by the
same two authors to ensure that the inclusion/exclusion criteria
were met.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
To be included in this review, studies had to: (a) be published
between 1998 and 2016, (b) reported empirical data, (c) provide
a definition of self-injury and of their method of assessment, (d)
not focus on treatment for NSSI, (e) be published in the English
language. There were no restrictions on participant.
Reason for exclusion were: (a) samples could be not
categorized as universal, (b) studies were based on the same
results already found in another publication, (c) the full text was
not available.

RESULTS
We identified 53 studies that met the inclusion criteria for this
review. Table 1 provide a summary of the data obtained from
each study.
Diagnostic Criteria
Recent research on NSSI disorder (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013) found that a high percentage of those
who self-injure met the DSM-5 proposed criteria (Glenn and
Klonsky, 2013; Washburn et al., 2015). In a community sample
of 3,097 Swedish adolescents, Zetterqvist et al. (2013) found
that 6.7% met the criteria, whereas in a sample of adolescent
impatients prevalence was 50% (Glenn and Klonsky, 2013).
Empirical data on a potential NSSI disorder have collected among
clinical and community samples of adolescents and adults, using
different version of proposed criteria (Shaffer and Jacobson, 2009;
American Psychiatric Association, 2012, 2013). In a combination
samples of inpatient and intensive outpatient subjects 85.5% met
Criterion A (Washburn et al., 2015). Two hundred and five
of adolescents reported frequent and multiple forms of NSSI
(Zetterqvist et al., 2013). For Criterion B, high endorsement was
found in clinical sample of adolescents and adults (In-Albon
et al., 2013; Zetterqvist et al., 2013; Washburn et al., 2015), as well
as in general adult samples (Andover, 2014; Gratz et al., 2015).
Almost all of adolescents (99.5%) who fulfilled criteria for NSSI
disorder reported engaging NSSI to relieve both intrapersonal
and interpersonal difficulties (Zetterqvist et al., 2013), likewise
most patients engaged in NSSI with the expectation to lead
relief from either a negative feeling or cognitive state (82.0%)
or resolution of an interpersonal problem (57.1%) (Washburn
et al., 2015). Automatic functions are reported significantly more
often than social functions, in adolescents and adults (Zetterqvist
et al., 2013; Andover, 2014). In Washburn et al. (2015), it was
also rare to meet Criterion B without also meeting Criterion
C: C1 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) was the most
commonly endorsed symptom, but patients also reported high
endorsement (62.4%) for all three symptoms.
Clinicians and expert NSSI researchers described experiencing
negative feeling or through prior to the NSSI behavior as a
prototypic symptom, following by preoccupation and urge to
engage with a less agreement (Lengel and Mullins-Sweatt, 2013).
Criterion D—behavior act for purposes not socially sanctioned—
had an agreement of 88% as being relevant characteristic to
the disorder (Lengel and Mullins-Sweatt, 2013). The presence
of clinically significant distress or impairment (Criterion E) is
considered difficult to assess, NSSI behavior would lead relief
rather than impairing. NSSID group reported more distress and
impairment in functioning than non-NSSID group (Zetterqvist
et al., 2013; Andover, 2014; Gratz et al., 2015). Several studies
have assessed Criterion F using indirect methods (e.g., In-Albon
et al., 2013; Andover, 2014).
Epidemiology
Prevalence rates of NSSI in adolescents fall between 7.5 and
46.5%, rising to 38.9% among university students and 4–23%
among adults (Briere and Gil, 1998; Gratz et al., 2002; Whitlock
et al., 2006; Lloyd-Richardson et al., 2007; Hilt et al., 2008a;
Plener et al., 2009; Cerutti et al., 2012; Andover, 2014). Although
self-injurious behavior is a widespread phenomenon, data vary
considerably across samples. The age onset of NSSI most often
occurs in early adolescence, between 12 and 14 years (Nock
et al., 2006; Muehlenkamp and Gutierrez, 2007; Cerutti et al.,
2011), but findings have also reported NSSI behavior in children
under the age of 12 (Barrocas et al., 2012). The most common
method was self-cutting (over 70%) followed by head banging,
scratching, hitting and burning (Briere and Gil, 1998; Laye-
Gindhu and Schonert-Reichl, 2005; Gratz, 2006; Whitlock et al.,
2006). However, most individuals who engage in NSSI employ
more than one method (e.g., Whitlock et al., 2011) acting on
the arms, legs, wrists and stomach (Whitlock et al., 2006; Lloyd-
Richardson et al., 2007; Klonsky, 2011; Sornberger et al., 2012).
The results from some studies suggested that women displayed
more NSSI behaviors than males, in both clinical and non-clinical
samples (Ross and Heath, 2002; Laye-Gindhu and Schonert-
Reichl, 2005; Whitlock et al., 2006, 2011; Claes et al., 2007;
Muehlenkamp and Gutierrez, 2007; Yates et al., 2008; Plener et al.,
2009; Sornberger et al., 2012; Muehlenkamp et al., 2013). A meta-
analysis by Bresin and Schoenleber (2015) demonstrated that
women are slightly more likely than men to engage in NSSI.
Differences concern also the type of method chosen: self-
cutting is most common among women, that were more likely
than men to engage in methods of NSSI that generally involve
blood (Sornberger et al., 2012), whereas hitting, burning and
banging are most common among men (Laye-Gindhu and
Schonert-Reichl, 2005; Claes et al., 2007). On the other hand,
equal rates of NSSI between the genders have been reported
within samples of adolescents, college students, and adults (Briere
and Gil, 1998; Nock et al., 2006; Lloyd-Richardson et al., 2007;
Hilt et al., 2008a; Cerutti et al., 2011, 2012; Kirchner et al., 2011;
Kaess et al., 2013), as well as clinical samples of adults (Briere and
Gil, 1998). Although no race differences were noted in NSSI rate
among adolescents and university samples (Gratz et al., 2002; Hilt
et al., 2008a), data on ethnic/minority groups are scarce. Within
ethnically diverse sample, multiracial college students reported
high prevalence rates (20.8%), followed by Caucasian (16.8) and
Hispanic (17%) (Kuentzel et al., 2012). However, research on
non-Caucasian subjects was limited to few countries. Among
Chinese students prevalence rates of NSSI ranged 24.9–29.2%
(Wan et al., 2015; Tang et al., 2016), likewise Zoroglu et al. (2003)
reported that 21.4% of Turkish adolescents engage NSSI.
NSSI and Other Disorders
According to research literature, NSSI is often associated
with several maladaptive outcomes. Most notably, there is an
association between NSSI and the diagnosis of BPD (Briere and
Gil, 1998; Nock et al., 2006; Glenn and Klonsky, 2013; Gratz et al.,
2015). Although listed as a diagnostic criterion for BPD (DSM-
5, American Psychiatric Association, 2013), NSSI may also occur
in individuals who do not receive BPD diagnosis, and not every
individual who receives BPD diagnosis engages in self-harm
behaviors (e.g., In-Albon et al., 2013). Differences between NSSI-
group and BPD-group would suggest to define NSSI as syndrome
in its own right (Selby et al., 2012; Turner et al., 2015). Even

though NSSI and suicidal behavior are distinct, suicide attempts
and suicide ideation were found in both clinical and non-clinical
samples of adolescents (Nock et al., 2006; Plener et al., 2009).
Exploring the association between NSSI and psychiatric
diagnoses, several researchers have reported self-injurious
behavior in a wide range of other disorders, such as post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dissociative disorder, conduct
disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, intermittent explosive
disorder, anxiety and mood disorder, substance use disorder,
bulimia, and dissociative identity disorder (Briere and Gil,
1998; Nock et al., 2006; Claes et al., 2007; Selby et al., 2012;
Glenn and Klonsky, 2013; In-Albon et al., 2013; Gratz et al.,
2015; Jenkins et al., 2015; Turner et al., 2015). Furthermore,
in a study on DSH behavior among young Italian adults,
individuals with a history of DSH, compared with individuals
with no history of DSH, reported higher levels of dissociations
and depersonalization (Cerutti et al., 2012). In addition, a
relationship between NSSI and eating disorders often appears
(Claes et al., 2001; Iannaccone et al., 2013; Eichen et al.,
2016), although not all researchers confirm such an association
(Selby et al., 2012). Cerutti et al. (2012) found that adults
with NSSI history reported negative attitudes toward the body
and lower levels of body protection. In both clinical and non-
clinical samples, those who self-injury were more likely to report
depressive symptomatology and anxiety (Ross and Heath, 2002;
Muehlenkamp and Gutierrez, 2007; Giletta et al., 2012; Selby
et al., 2012). Moreover, results provided significantly higher rates
of both internalizing (Nock et al., 2006; Glenn and Klonsky,
2013; In-Albon et al., 2013) and externalizing disorders (Nock
et al., 2006). Adolescents who engage in NSSI were more likely
to present several health-risk behaviors, such as substance abuse,
risky sexual behaviors, and maladaptive eating habits (Hilt et al.,
2008a; Giletta et al., 2012). In a study that assess potential
NSSI disorder (Gratz et al., 2015) participants who met the
proposed criteria for NSSID (DSM-5, American Psychiatric
Association, 2013) differed from NSSI-group and reported

significantly more depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, and
BPD disorder.
Etiology
The potential etiologic factors of NSSI may be divided into
two major categories: individual (e.g., emotional dysregulation,
psychiatric
disorders)
and
environmental
(e.g.,
childhood
maltreatments, attachment disruption). Most research focused
on early childhood traumatic experiences found that childhood
maltreatments emerged as a predictor of NSSI within adolescents
and college students (Paivio and McCulloch, 2004; Gratz,
2006; Arens et al., 2012; Auerbach et al., 2014; Wan et al.,
2015). Exploration of environmental contributors revealed that
childhood sexual abuse would present a strong link with NSSI
development (Briere and Gil, 1998; Gratz et al., 2002; Gratz,
2006; Gratz and Chapman, 2007; Yates et al., 2008; Auerbach
et al., 2014). However, other researchers have not found a strong
association with sexual abuse (Zoroglu et al., 2003; Whitlock
et al., 2006; Goldstein et al., 2009). In their study among college
female students, Gratz (2006) found that both environmental
and individual factors were strongly associated with NSSI,
as well their interaction. Gratz et al. (2002) emphasized the
role of parental relationship in the etiology of self-injurious
behaviors: insecure paternal attachment and both maternal and
paternal emotional neglect were significant predictors of NSSI
within women, whereas NSSI in men was primarily predicted
by childhood separation (usually from father). Furthermore,
maternal rejection appeared the only significant predictor among
psychiatric inpatients sample (Kaess et al., 2013).
Most recent studies have investigated the role of stress-full life
events in the etiology of NSSI (Cerutti et al., 2011; Tang et al.,
2016). Among Chinese adolescents, Tang et al. (2016) found that
adverse life experiences were associated with moderate and severe
NSSI and a lesser risk of engaging NSSI in those who had a
good emotional regulation. Examining individual factors, results
reported that NSSI frequency was strongly predicted by emotion
dysregulation and affect intensity/reactivity within men (Gratz
and Chapman, 2007), and by emotional inexpressivity within
women (Gratz, 2006). Low emotional expressiveness would have
a role in engagement in NSSI (Jacobson et al., 2015). Results of a
regression analysis showed that difficulties to identify and express
emotional experience appropriately (i.e., alexithymia) mediated
the relation between childhood trauma (except sexual abuse) and
NSSI (Paivio and McCulloch, 2004).
Functions
Engage in NSSI may serves several functions that are not
mutually exclusive (Nock and Prinstein, 2004; Klonsky, 2011).
The most common function seems to be the affect regulation
(Nock and Prinstein, 2004; Laye-Gindhu and Schonert-Reichl,
2005; Claes et al., 2007; Muehlenkamp et al., 2013). Indeed,
negative emotions, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and
loneliness, tend to occur before the NSSI behavior, whereas an
increase in positive emotions and a decrease in negative emotions
would follow as well (e.g., Laye-Gindhu and Schonert-Reichl,
2005; Claes et al., 2007). Moreover, Giletta et al. (2012) found
that engaging NSSI were strongly associated with depressive
feelings among Italian, USA and Dutch samples. NSSI may
represent a strategy for affect regulation (Laye-Gindhu and
Schonert-Reichl, 2005). Nock and Prinstein (2004) proposed a
functional model of NSSI, known as the Four Factor Model
(FFM). FFM is grounded on behavioral theory, which focus
on the antecedent and consequent influences that produce and
maintain the behavior.
The
FFM
delineates
two
dichotomous
dimensions
of
functional
processes:
contingencies
interpersonal/social
vs.
intrapersonal/automatic, and reinforcement positive vs. negative.
The four processes proposed by the model include: automatic
negative reinforcement when NSSI serves to reduce aversive
internal states, automatic positive reinforcement, when NSSI
serves to generate positive feelings, social negative reinforcement,
when NSSI serves to avoid interpersonal demands, and social
positive reinforcement, when NSSI serves to gain attention,
or increase social support (Nock and Prinstein, 2004). Much
of the studies on the psychological reasons underlying the
NSSI behavior has mainly focused on emotion regulation
and tension reduction, but social functions of NSSI have also
been described in both adolescents (Nock and Prinstein, 2004;
Lloyd-Richardson et al., 2007; Hilt et al., 2008a,b; Turner et al.,
2012; Muehlenkamp et al., 2013; Zetterqvist et al., 2013) and
adults samples (Turner et al., 2012, 2016). Engaging NSSI “to
stop bad feelings” was endorsed by 56.8% of German inpatients
sample, in which automatic functions were predicted by adverse
childhood experiences (Kaess et al., 2013). Self-punishment
function was commonly endorsed by adolescents and adult
among community and clinic samples (Briere and Gil, 1998;
Laye-Gindhu and Schonert-Reichl, 2005; Lloyd-Richardson
et al., 2007; Turner et al., 2012; Glenn and Klonsky, 2013; Kaess
et al., 2013). Although males were more likely to engage NSSI
for social reasons (Claes et al., 2007) and females to relieve
negative emotional states and self-punishment (Briere and
Gil, 1998; Glenn and Klonsky, 2013), no significant gender
differences emerged about NSSI functions among adolescents
samples (e.g., Lloyd-Richardson et al., 2007; Calvete et al., 2015).
Zetterqvist et al. (2013) found that about 90% of adolescents
those met proposed criteria for NSSI disorder most commonly
reported automatic negative functions, followed by automatic
positive ones, and about 27% reported social functions. Greater
endorsement of intrapersonal functions than social was also
found among adult with NSSI Disorder (Andover, 2014).
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to review the existing literature
on NSSI by providing a preliminary understanding of the main
features. There is general consensus that NSSI begins in early
adolescence, with a main age onset of 12 years old. Even
though only few studies have investigated NSSI within children
younger than 12 years old (Kirchner et al., 2011; Barrocas et al.,
2012; Sornberger et al., 2012). Prevalence is even high among
adult, mostly in samples of university students. Studies have
demonstrated a high variability on prevalence rates. Some of this
variability may partially explain by a growing interest in NSSI

 Cipriano et al.
Nonsuicidal Self-injury
behavior. Nevertheless, the assessment methods chosen appears
to heavily influence the estimates of prevalence: checklists would
seem to provide higher estimates than single item questions
(Muehlenkamp et al., 2012).
In order to overcome the mentioned assessment bias, future
research will have to accurately investigate perceptions and
interpretations of participants which may not reflect NSSI
definition provided. NSSI is generally assumed to be more
common among females than men. This assumption is not
fully supported by existing literature. Self-injury is popularly
associated with “cutting” and this could have influenced data,
as females are more likely to self-cut than men. Literature has
primarily focused on women samples and higher prevalence on
NSSI among females could be due to an over representation
of women (Claes et al., 2007). Data on non-Caucasian samples
are scarce, but it may be due to an ethnocentric bias that
tend to underestimate the culture impact on NSSI. Indeed,
similar rates of prevalence among female adolescent and methods
used, in Chinese samples, could be consider a reflection of
Western culture’s influence, and NSSI in minorities group, such
as Native Americans (e.g., Kuentzel et al., 2012), could be related
to culturally sanctioned rituals (ceremonial or religious). Due
to paucity of studies on racial/ethnic differences in NSSI, its
distribution and prevalence remain unclear.
Regarding etiology, the relation between sexual abuse and
NSSI remains still contentious. Evidence suggests that additional
risk factors, both environmental and individual, may play a
role in the etiology of NSSI: a history of child maltreatment
and stressful life experiences could represent a vulnerability that
disrupt emotional regulation function. Therefore, several forms
of maltreatment appear to be related to engaging NSSI in both
clinical and non-clinical samples (e.g., Briere and Gil, 1998;
Gratz et al., 2002; Gratz, 2006; Yates et al., 2008; Arens et al.,
2012; Auerbach et al., 2014), whereas individual factors might
play a role in the maintenance of the behavior (e.g., Gratz and
Chapman, 2007; Jacobson et al., 2015). So, a potential interaction
between risk factors should be explored. Emotional regulation
was the most common reason for NSSI behavior: individuals
who self-injury commonly reported negative experiences, such as
depression, anxiety, and angry, before NSSI. To further support
automatic function, NSSI would result in a negative emotions
reduction. Although interpersonal functions have not received
as much attention, both adolescents and adult endorsed social
reasons to engage NSSI (e.g., Nock and Prinstein, 2004; Lloyd-
Richardson et al., 2007; Hilt et al., 2008b; Zetterqvist et al.,
2013). Moreover, lower prevalence of social functions could be
explained by the fact that NSSI is a private act and who self-injury
may be socially isolated and experience negative emotions that
increase the likelihood of further acts to reduce tension state. The
inclusion of a potential NSSI disorder in the DSM-5 is justified by
the clinical benefits that would ensue from a better understanding
of the behavior.
Empirical research on NSSI disorder has recently begun to
provide relevant data. It is however limited by the use of the
different methods employed in assessing NSSI, and not originally
envisaged for this purpose. There are several important obstacles
regarding diagnostic validity of NSSID. Firstly, delimitation from
other disorders. Self-injurious behavior primarily existed in the
DSM as a symptom of BPD but, although NSSI and BPD can
co-occur, they also present themselves independently (In-Albon
et al., 2013). Most studies, focused on NSSI disorder rather
than BPD, have highlighted that NSSI is not indicative of BPD
and that the diagnostic coincidence of NSSI disorder and BPD
was similar to existed to a lesser degree than BPD and other
disorders (Glenn and Klonsky, 2013). Moreover, the introduction
of NSSI disorder recognizes the importance of differentiating
NSSI from attempted suicide. Although both suicide attempts
and NSSI conform to a continuum of self-harming behaviors,
there are important clinically differences among behaviors in
etiology, psychiatric impairment, functions, methods and course.
The use of diverse criteria, different assessment methodologies
and the absence of studies employing all the criteria as proposed
in the DSM-5, have deterred advancement in this field.
Strengths and Limitations
The current review not only includes women engaged in self-
injury but also men, and goes some way to addressing the
misrepresentation present in previous literature, which could be
explained by the fact that men behave differently to women in this
context. This study only addresses the links between NSSI and
biological roots and developmental\intellectual disabilities in
part, and does not address NSSI treatment. Our review attempted
to understand the main causes and functions of NSSI through
studies on clinical and non-clinical populations but many aspects
remain unclear, especially as regard NSSI etiology. Finally, we
must consider the secretive nature of self-injury due to which
prevalence rates may be seen to be ambiguous. Studies on NSSI
treatment were not included.
Implications for Future Research
Despite the behavior is more likely to present in adolescence,
the variation in age of onset and in prevalence rates among
adolescents and adults suggest that there may be different
developmental trajectories in NSSI and a lack of knowledge
regarding the course of NSSI: further exploration should employ
a longitudinal approach aimed at examining the risk factors and
progression of a potential NSSI disorder. This implication is
directly related to the need for additional research using a variety
of adult group to obtain accurate prevalence rates, as data on
adult samples have mostly collected in educational institutions.
Findings on gender differences provided contradictory data
that could benefit from future research that also consider other
variables, such as culture, school, and social contagion. More
research would be helpful in understanding the course and
patterns of NSSI and exploring NSSI among gender. Research
should be extended to other cultures and ethnicities, in order to
recognize the influence of cultural factors on these behaviors.
Self-injurious behavior for culturally sanctioned purposes (e.g.,
religious ritual, tattoos and piercings) was not considered in
the research field nor included among the proposed diagnostic
criteria for NSSID in the DSM-5. The contextualization of
behavior is required, as is an exploration of the similarities and
differences in prevalence rates, methods and functions across
cultures. Although findings suggest the role of abuse, neglect

NSSI
behavior,
future
research
could
explore
other
characteristics of maltreatment experiences, such as frequency,
perpetrator, bond type between child, and abuser, and cumulative
effects.
There may be several reasons for engaging in NSSI and future
research should investigate the mechanism underlying NSSI, the
role of gender differences and whether functions change during
development in order to a more complete understanding of
the behavior. Moreover, there are still several areas that require
further investigation to give credence to NSSI as a disorder in
its own right: it would be pertinent to provide a valid, clinical
delineation of the disorder and develop a standardized tool for its
assessment in order to improve research, to conduct longitudinal
studies and cross-cultural and ethnic studies, but there is still
further work to be done.
CONCLUSIONS
NSSI is a common phenomenon among adolescents and adults,
associated with significant impairment. Over the years, interest
in NSSI grew to such an extent that an ongoing debate was
instigated on whether NSSI should be considered as a diagnosis
in its own right and given its own category. As a result, it was
included in section 3 of the DSM-5 as a condition requiring
further studies. This paper provides an up-to-date overview on
self-injury, what is known about it and what remains to be done.
