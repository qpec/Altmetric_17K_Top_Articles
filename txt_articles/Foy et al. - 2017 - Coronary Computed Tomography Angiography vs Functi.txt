IMPORTANCE Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is a new approach for the
diagnosis of anatomical coronary artery disease (CAD), but it is unclear how CCTA performs
compared with the standard approach of functional stress testing.
OBJECTIVE To compare the clinical effectiveness of CCTA with that of functional stress testing
for patients with suspected CAD.
DATA SOURCES A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE for
English-language randomized clinical trials of CCTA published from January 1, 2000, to July
10, 2016.
STUDY SELECTION Researchers selected randomized clinical trials that compared a primary
strategy of CCTA with that of functional stress testing for patients with suspected CAD and
reported data on patient clinical events and changes in therapy.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently extracted data from and
assessed the quality of the trials. This analysis followed the PRISMA statement for reporting
systematic reviews and meta-analyses and used the Cochrane Collaboration’
s tool for
assessing risk of bias in randomized trials. The Mantel-Haenszel method was used to conduct
the primary analysis. Summary relative risks were calculated with a random-effects model.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, cardiac
hospitalization, myocardial infarction, invasive coronary angiography, coronary
revascularization, new CAD diagnoses, and change in prescription for aspirin and statins.
RESULTS Thirteen trials were included, with 10 315 patients in the CCTA arm and 9777
patients in the functional stress testing arm who were followed up for a mean duration of
18 months. There were no statistically significant differences between CCTA and functional
stress testing in death (1.0% vs 1.1%; risk ratio [RR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.71-1.21) or cardiac
hospitalization (2.7% vs 2.7%; RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79-1.21), but CCTA was associated with
a reduction in the incidence of myocardial infarction (0.7% vs 1.1%; RR, 0.71; 95% CI,
0.53-0.96). Patients undergoing CCTA were significantly more likely to undergo invasive
coronary angiography (11.7% vs 9.1%; RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.12-1.59) and revascularization (7.2%
vs 4.5%; RR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.43-2.43). They were also more likely to receive a diagnosis of new
CAD and to have initiated aspirin or statin therapy.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Compared with functional stress testing, CCTA is associated
with a reduced incidence of myocardial infarction but an increased incidence of invasive
coronary angiography, revascularization, CAD diagnoses, and new prescriptions for aspirin
and statins. Despite these differences, CCTA is not associated with a reduction in mortality or
cardiac hospitalizations.

testing assesses for inducible cardiac ischemia. Coro-
nary computed tomography angiography has higher diagnos-
tic accuracy for coronary artery disease (CAD) when using in-
vasivecoronaryangiographyasthereferencestandard.1Several
studies have concluded that CCTA is safe and expedites the tri-
age of patients in the emergency department with acute chest
pain compared with standard care.2,3 United States and Euro-
pean cardiology guidelines include the use of CCTA for pa-
tients with suspected CAD.4
Whether CCTA improves clinical outcomes compared with
traditional functional stress testing for patients with sus-
pected CAD remains unclear. Meta-analyses comparing CCTA

ited number of trials and have not assessed the effect on new
diagnoses of CAD and changes to cardiac medication.5-8 Be-
cause the value of diagnostic tests lies in their ability to affect
clinical management and improve patient outcomes, we per-
formed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized
clinical trials (RCTs) for CCTA vs functional stress testing to ex-
aminesubsequentpatientmanagementandcardiovascularout-
comes for patients with both acute and stable chest pain.
Methods
Data Sources
We followed the PRISMA statement for reporting systematic
reviews and meta-analyses.9 A systematic search of MEDLINE
and PubMed for English-language RCTs of CCTA was per-
formed. Search terms corresponding to coronary computed to-
mography angiography limited to RCTs conducted for adults
from January 1, 2000, to July 10, 2016, were used. We also
searched the references of all articles retrieved (eAppendix in
the Supplement). We identified all RCTs of CCTA vs func-
tional stress testing for patients with suspected CAD that in-
cluded information on downstream cardiovascular events and
patient management with at least 1 month of follow-up. This
study used deidentified, trial level data from published trials.
The data publicly available at the time our study was per-
formed; thus, institutional review board approval was not
sought, nor was it necessary.
Study Selection
Two of us (A.J.F. and B.P.) independently performed the fol-
lowing steps to screen studies identified in the database search
and to extract data. Any disagreements were resolved by con-
sensus. First, all titles were reviewed to exclude studies that
were observational, that performed the wrong test (eg, lower
extremityCTA),orthataddressedthewrongquestion(eg,com-
paring diagnostic accuracy or comparing different CCTA tech-
niques),followedbyreviewingabstractsoftheremainingstud-
ies using the same exclusion criteria.
Data Extraction
Two of us (A.J.F. and B.P.) independently reviewed all stud-
ies meeting the inclusion criteria and performed standard-
ized data extraction of the following study characteristics:
patient population (eg, acute vs stable chest pain), setting
(eg, emergency department, inpatient, or outpatient), design
(eg, intervention and comparator arms), primary end point
(s), duration of follow-up, patient characteristics, and patient
outcomes (all-cause death, myocardial infarction [MI], car-
diac hospitalization, invasive coronary angiography, coro-
nary revascularization including percutaneous coronary in-
tervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery, new CAD
diagnosis, new medication change for aspirin, and new medi-
cation change for statin therapy). New CAD was diagnosed
when patients had either angiographic evidence of obstruc-
tive CAD on a CCTA (ie, >50% obstruction) and/or angio-
graphic evidence of obstructive CAD on an invasive coronary
angiogram (ie, >50% obstruction). If these data were not pro-
vided, new CAD was diagnosed if any of the following diag-
noses were explicitly stated: acute coronary syndrome, stable
angina, or CAD.
Data Synthesis
The Mantel-Haenszel method was used to conduct the pri-
maryanalysis.Eachclinicaloutcomewasorganizedintoa2 × 2
table and analyzed on the log relative scale using a random-
effects model. A prespecified subgroup analysis was per-
formed based on whether patients were being evaluated for
acute vs stable chest pain. Trials that did not report the clini-
cal end point of interest were removed from the denominator
and not factored into the analysis. Trials in which the end point
of interest was reported but no events occurred in either arm
were included in the analyses using a fixed-count correction
method, where a value of 1 was added to all cell counts. Trials
in which the end point of interest was reported but events oc-
curred in only 1 arm were included without the need for cor-
rection. Examination of heterogeneity was performed using
Q statistics and I2. Heterogeneity was assessed for all studies
Key Points
Question For patients with suspected coronary artery disease,
what is the effect on clinical outcomes of coronary computed
tomography angiography compared with functional stress testing?
Findings This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized
clinical trials found that, compared with functional stress testing,
coronary computed tomography angiography may reduce the
incidence of myocardial infarction, but not death or cardiac
hospitalizations. Coronary computed tomography angiography
increased the downstream rates of invasive coronary angiography
and coronary revascularization, as well as new coronary artery
disease diagnoses and new prescriptions for aspirin and statin
medications.
Meaning Compared with functional stress testing, coronary
computed tomography angiography is associated with a
decreased incidence of myocardial infarction in patients with
suspected coronary artery disease, as well as an increase in
detection of coronary artery disease and use of secondary
prevention medications; tradeoffs involve an increase in
downstream invasive procedures, many of which may be
unnecessary.

 combined and between subgroups. A sensitivity analysis was
performed for each end point by excluding individual stud-
ies. Examination of publication bias was performed visually
using funnel plots.
Quality of Trials
Two of us (A.J.F. and S.S.D.) independently assessed the qual-
ity of the trials using Cochrane Collaboration’
s tool for assess-
ing risk of bias in randomized trials.10 Any disagreements were
resolved by consensus.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with Review Manager
(RevMan), version 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Coch-
rane Collaboration). P values were 2 sided, with P < .05 con-
sidered statistically significant.
Results
Qualitative Synthesis
Wescreened216recordsand19full-textarticles(Figure1),from
which 13 RCTs that randomized 20 092 patients were in-
cluded:10 315patientswereassignedtotheCCTAarmand9777
were assigned to the functional stress testing arm.2,3,11-21 Mean
participant age was 58 years, and 9845 were women (49.0%).
Patients in the acute chest pain subgroup were significantly
younger than those in the stable chest pain subgroup (53 vs
59 years; eTable 1 in the Supplement). The mean duration of
follow-up was 18 months; follow-up was longer in the stable
chest pain subgroup than in the acute chest pain subgroup (23
vs 5 months; Table 1).
The CCTA strategy used in the intervention arm differed
across studies, and most of the RCTs did not follow prespeci-
fied protocols for handling indeterminate stenosis identified
on a CCTA. In 2 trials, there were prespecified plans to follow
up all cases of intermediate stenosis with myocardial perfu-
sion imaging,11,12 and in 1 trial (SCOT-HEART [Scottish Com-
puted Tomography of the Heart Trial]), 85% of patients re-
ceived functional stress testing in both arms.21
The stress testing arms varied among trials, with mul-
tiple modalities, including no testing, used in 4 trials (31%),
myocardial perfusion imaging used in 4 trials (31%), exercise
treadmill or bike electrocardiography testing used in 3 trials
(23%),andstressechocardiographyusedin1trial(8%);themo-
dality was not specified in 1 trial (8%). In 2 studies in which
multiplemodalitieswereusedthatinvolvedpatientswithacute
chest pain, 42% of patients in one trial and 26% of patients in
the other trial did not undergo any functional stress testing in
the control arms.2,3
Nine trials involved patients who presented to the emer-
gency department with symptoms concerning for acute coro-
nary syndrome and who underwent testing prior to or shortly
following hospital discharge.2,3,11-13,15-17,20 Eight trials re-
quired initially normal serum troponin level test results and
nonischemic electrocardiogram results,2,3,11-13,15,16,20 while 1
trial enrolled patients admitted with suspected acute coro-
nary syndrome who were thought to be at intermediate risk
based on elevated troponin levels, electrocardiographic
changes, or clinical signs or symptoms.17 Four trials involved
patients who underwent testing in the outpatient setting for
symptoms of stable chest pain.14,18,19,21
There was significant variation in the quality of the trials
based on the Cochrane Collaboration’
s tool for bias assess-
ment (eTable 2 in the Supplement). The overall quality of evi-
dencewasjudgedtobemoderate,with45of98domains(46%)
judged to be at high or questionable risk for bias. In all stud-
ies,atleast2domainswerepotentiallysusceptibletobias.Lack
of blinding patients and personnel was noted in all trials. Only
3 trials explicitly used blinded outcome assessment,12,18,21 and
only 5 trials explicitly stated their technique for allocation con-
cealment in the publications.2,11,15,16,21 The SCOT-HEART was
assigned a high risk of other bias because its design included
functional stress testing for 85% of patients in the CCTA arm.21
The funding source was noted as a possible risk of other bias
in 3 trials because industry-sponsored trials are nearly 4 times
more likely to report positive results than are non–industry-
sponsored studies.11,12,14,22
Quantitative Results
All-Cause Mortality
There was no difference between CCTA and functional stress
testing in mortality overall (1.0% vs 1.1%; risk ratio [RR], 0.93;
95% CI, 0.71-1.21) or in patients with acute (0.3% vs 0.6%; RR,
0.66; 95% CI, 0.27-1.59) or stable chest pain (1.3% vs 1.3%; RR,
0.96; 95% CI, 0.72-1.27) (Table 2 and eFigure 1 in the Supple-
ment). No deaths occurred in 7 trials, and zero event han-
dling was used.2,3,11-14,20 There was no significant heteroge-

 neity between trials (χ2 = 2.74; P = .95; eFigure 1 in the
Supplement). The overall effect estimate is not sensitive to the
inclusion or exclusion of any individual trial. There was no sig-
nificant interaction noted between the acute and stable chest
pain subgroups (χ2 = 0.64; P = .99). There is mild visual asym-
metry in the funnel plot in eFigure 2 in the Supplement in fa-
vor of CCTA related to PROSPECT (Prospective Randomized
Outcome Trial Comparing Radionuclide Stress Myocardial Per-
fusion Imaging and ECG-Gated Coronary CT Angiography).17
Removal of this trial did not lead to a significant difference in
the overall effect estimate.
Myocardial Infarction
Coronary computed tomography angiography was associ-
ated with a reduction in MIs overall (0.7% vs 1.1%; RR, 0.71;
95% CI, 0.53-0.96) and for patients with stable chest pain
but not those with acute chest pain (Table 2 and Figure 2).
No MIs occurred in 4 trials, and zero event handling was
used.11-14 There was only a modest amount of heterogeneity
between trials, which was not statistically significant
(χ2 = 0.31; P = .58; Figure 2). The overall effect estimate is
sensitive to the exclusion of the SCOT-HEART trial, which
assigned most patients in the CCTA arm to undergo func-
tional stress testing.21 Its removal leads to a 17% increase in
the relative risk estimate that is no longer statistically signifi-
cant (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.70-1.21). The relative risk reduction
was greater for patients with stable chest pain (RR, 0.68;
95% CI, 0.49-0.95) than for patients with acute chest pain
(RR, 0.84; 95% CI 0.44-1.61) (Table 2), but there was no sig-
nificant interaction between groups (χ2 = 0.31; P = .58).
There is no visual asymmetry in the funnel plot in eFigure 3
in the Supplement.

 Cardiac Hospitalization
There was no statistically significant difference between CCTA
and functional stress testing in cardiac hospitalizations overall
(2.7% vs 2.7%; RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.79-1.21) or for patients with
acute(4.8%vs6.3%;RR,0.83;95%CI,0.66-1.04)orstablechest
pain(2.0%vs1.7%;RR,1.21;95%CI,0.96-1.53)(Table2andeFig-
ure 4 in the Supplement). There was only a modest amount of
heterogeneity between trials, which was not statistically sig-
nificant (χ2 = 14.26; P = .22; eFigure 4 in the Supplement), and
theoveralleffectestimateisnotsensitivetotheinclusionorex-
clusion of any individual trial. An important interaction was
foundbetweentheacuteandstablechestpaingroups(χ2 = 5.15;
P = .02; eFigure 4 in the Supplement). Coronary computed to-
mography angiography led to a nonstatistically significant re-
duction in cardiac hospitalizations of patients with acute chest
pain (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66-1.04) but a nonstatistically signifi-
cant increase in cardiac hospitalizations of patients with stable
chest pain (RR 1.21; 95 CI, 0.96-1.53). There is no visual asym-
metry in the funnel plot in eFigure 5 in the Supplement.
Invasive Coronary Angiography
Coronary computed tomography angiography was associ-
ated with an increase in invasive coronary angiography pro-
cedures overall (11.7% vs 9.1%; RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.12-1.59) and
in both the acute (9.2% vs 7.2%; RR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.10-1.76)
and stable chest pain (12.7% vs 9.8%; RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.96-
1.70)subgroups(Table2andeFigure6inthe Supplement).The
overall effect estimate is not sensitive to the inclusion or ex-
clusion of any individual trial. There was significant hetero-
geneity found between trials (χ2 = 29.29; P = .004). The main
source of heterogeneity is the SCOT-HEART trial.21 When it is
excluded, there is no significant heterogeneity (χ2 = 12.59;
P = .32). There was no significant interaction identified be-
tween the acute and stable chest pain subgroups (χ2 = 0.22;
P = .64). There is mild visual asymmetry in the funnel plot in

spective First Evaluation in Chest Pain) trial.20 Removal of this

bThe basis for the assumed risk is based on the risk in the functional stress
testing groups. The corresponding risk (and its 95% CI) is based on the
assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the
intervention (and its 95% CI).

 Revascularization
Coronary computed tomography angiography was associ-
ated with an increase in revascularizations overall (7.2% vs
4.5%; RR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.43-2.43) and in both the acute (5.2%
vs2.8%;RR,1.96;95%CI,1.45-2.65)andstablechestpain(7.9%
vs 5.1%; RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.12-2.60) subgroups (Table 2 and
Figure 3). The overall effect estimate is not sensitive to the in-
clusion or exclusion of any individual trial. There was signifi-
cant heterogeneity between trials (χ2 = 29.87; P = .003). The
main source of heterogeneity is the SCOT-HEART trial.21 When
it is excluded, there is no significant heterogeneity. There is
mild visual asymmetry in the funnel plot related to the SCOT-
HEART and PERFECT trials (eFigure 8 in the Supplement).20,21
Removal of these trials did not lead to a significant difference
in the overall effect estimate.
New CAD Diagnoses
Coronary computed tomography angiography was associ-
ated with an increase in new diagnoses of CAD overall (18.3%
vs 8.3%; RR, 2.80; 95% CI, 2.03-3.87) and in both the acute
(12.5% vs 5.0%; RR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.92-5.89) and stable chest
pain (23.8% vs 10.7%; RR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.51-3.66) subgroups
(Table 2 and eFigure 9 in the Supplement). The overall effect
estimate is not sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of any
individual trial. There was significant heterogeneity found be-
tweenthe9trialsthatallowedforadjudicationofthisendpoint
(χ2 = 27.31; P < .001).2,3,13-17,19-21 There was no significant in-
teraction between the acute and stable chest pain groups
(χ2 = 0.97; P = .32). There is mild visual asymmetry in
the funnel plot related to 2 small trials (eFigure 10 in the
Supplement).13,14 Removal of these trials did not lead to a sig-
nificant difference in the overall effect estimate.
Medication Change: Aspirin and Statins
Coronary computed tomography angiography was associ-
ated with a significant increase in the use of aspirin (21.6% vs
8.2%; RR 2.21; 95% CI, 1.20-4.04) and statin prescribing over-
all(20.0%vs7.3%;RR,2.03;95%CI,1.09-3.76)andinthestable

Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs comparing
outcomesinpatientsundergoingCCTAvsfunctionalstresstest-
ing for suspected CAD found no difference in mortality or car-
diac hospitalization; however, CCTA was associated with a re-
duction in MIs and an increase in invasive coronary
angiography procedures, revascularizations, new CAD diag-
noses, and aspirin use and statin prescribing.
Four meta-analyses have addressed the efficacy of CCTA
vs stress testing and reached different conclusions.5-8 The 3
analyses conducted for patients with acute chest pain have re-
lied on 4 RCTs each, and new trials have been conducted since
then; 1 included observational data.5-7 To our knowledge, only
1 meta-analysis has been conducted for outpatients with stable
chest pain.8 None of the meta-analyses assessed the out-
comes of new CAD diagnoses and medication changes be-
tween trial arms.5-8 Combining data from trials of both pa-
tients with acute chest pain and patients with stable chest pain
increases the sample size of this analysis. In addition, testing
for interactions between patients with acute chest pain and
those with stable chest pain better informs how clinical sce-
narios may affect the efficacy of CCTA compared with func-

 tional stress testing. For example, CCTA lowered the risk of MI
when including all trials, but the difference was only statisti-
cally significant in the stable chest pain subgroup. However,
the lack of an interaction effect between the subgroups sug-
gests that patients with acute chest pain may also benefit in
terms of MI reduction. Based on our results, 250 patients with
suspected CAD need to undergo CCTA rather than functional
stress testing to prevent 1 MI (number needed to treat, 250).
There are several reasons to view this reduction in MI cau-
tiously. The SCOT-HEART, which drove this finding, com-
paredCCTAplusfunctionalstresstestingwithfunctionalstress
testing alone and thus did not directly compare a CCTA strat-
egy with a functional stress testing strategy.21 Patients in the
CCTA arm in SCOT-HEART experienced a lower rate of excess
revascularization compared with those in the CCTA arm in all
other trials, which may be because patients with stenosis de-
tected by CCTA who did not have ischemia detected by func-
tional testing did not get referred for revascularization. Less
revascularization means lower rates of periprocedural MI
and cardiac events associated with in-stent thrombosis and
restenosis.
Coronary computed tomography angiography was not as-
sociated with an overall reduction in mortality or cardiac hos-
pitalizations. This finding may be due to a lack of power to de-
tect a reduction in mortality; however, a lack of power is
unlikely to account for the cardiac hospitalization finding be-
cause there were more than twice as many cardiac hospital-
izations as MIs, and the difference in MIs was statistically sig-
nificant.Infact,patientswithstablechestpainhadaborderline
statistically significant increase in cardiac hospitalizations in
the CCTA arm (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.96-1.53), despite the reduc-
tion in MIs in this subgroup (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.95). One
possible explanation is that the MI reduction for patients in the
CCTAarmisoffsetbydownstreamcardiachospitalizationsdue
to complications after a percutaneous coronary intervention
such as in-stent restenosis because these patients had higher
rates of revascularization. Another possible reason is that the
MIs prevented are small and would not be associated with sig-
nificantmorbidity;futureinvestigationsshouldinvestigatethis
possibility.
This analysis corroborates prior meta-analyses showing
that CCTA compared with functional stress testing is associ-
ated with increased invasive coronary angiography and revas-
cularization procedures.5-8 For every 37 patients who un-
dergoCCTA,therewillbe1excessrevascularizationprocedure.
We hypothesize that at least some of these additional proce-
dures are associated with the finding of incidental CAD that
is not causing symptomatic ischemia and would not have been
detected with functional stress testing alone. Results from
SCOT-HEART support this contention.21 Eighty-five percent of
patients in the CCTA arm of SCOT-HEART underwent func-
tional stress testing, and this arm had a nonsignificant excess
rate of revascularization (RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.97-1.39) that was
significantly lower than that of all other trials combined, ex-
cluding SCOT-HEART (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.70-2.30).21
A novel finding from our meta-analysis is that CCTA was
associated with an increase in new CAD diagnoses, based on
a criterion of obstructive stenosis of more than 50%, at 18.3%
for CCTA vs 8.3% for functional stress testing alone. This in-
crease in CAD diagnoses likely drove the associated increase
inaspirinandstatinuseandmightexplainthereductioninMIs.
However,arandomizedclinicaltrialofCCTAscreeningvsstan-
dard care for asymptomatic patients with diabetes failed to
show that more CCTA-related CAD diagnoses plus the result-
ing intensified care improved clinical outcomes.23
Limitations
Limitations to this meta-analysis include the use of trial-
level data rather than patient-level data. Thus, we are unable
to assess for heterogeneous effects associated with CCTA
that may be present based on age, sex, baseline risk, and
comparator test used. However, patient-level data are
unavailable. Our search was also limited to PubMed and
English-language studies. Furthermore, we did not analyze
end points of time to hospital discharge and cost for patients
in the emergency department with acute chest pain.6 We
also did not assess for differences in radiation exposure, an
end point dependent on the functional stress test modality
used in the comparator arms.
Conclusions
There were no significant differences between CCTA and func-
tional stress testing in the end points of mortality and cardiac
hospitalization. Coronary computed tomography angiogra-
phy was associated with a reduction in MIs but an increase in
invasive coronary angiography procedures, revasculariza-
tions, new CAD diagnoses, and aspirin and statin prescrip-
tions. Although these results may apply to patients with both
acuteandstablechestpainandsuspectedCAD,importantgaps

ence of heterogeneous effects for CCTA compared with func-

Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography—
The First Test for Evaluating Patients With Chest Pain?
Todd C. Villines, MD; Leslee J. Shaw, PhD
In November 2016, the National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE), the evidence-based organization that pro-
vides authoritative national guidance to improve health care
quality in the United King-
dom (UK), updated its clini-
cal guideline on the evalua-
tion of patients with chest
pain of recent onset.1 On the basis of a thorough literature re-
view, NICE updated the guideline to recommend coronary
computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) as the initial test
for all patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD)
who present with atypical and typical angina, and for those
withnonanginalchestpainwhohaveanabnormalrestingelec-
trocardiogram. This dramatic change to national health care
policy in the UK resonated across the Atlantic, where office-
based single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
has served for decades as the dominant noninvasive test for
CAD in the United States.
Why did NICE make such a drastic change? Over the past
15 years, CCTA certainly has undergone dramatic technologi-
