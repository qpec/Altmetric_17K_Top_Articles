Firearms account for a substantial proportion of external causes of death, injury, and disability across the world.
Legislation to regulate firearms has often been passed with the intent of reducing problems related to their use.
However, lack of clarity around which interventions are effective remains a major challenge for policy development.
Aiming to meet this challenge, we systematically reviewed studies exploring the associations between firearm-
related laws and firearm homicides, suicides, and unintentional injuries/deaths. We restricted our search to studies
published from 1950 to 2014. Evidence from 130 studies in 10 countries suggests that in certain nations the simul-
taneous implementation of laws targeting multiple firearms restrictions is associated with reductions in firearm
deaths. Laws restricting the purchase of (e.g., background checks) and access to (e.g., safer storage) firearms
are also associated with lower rates of intimate partner homicides and firearm unintentional deaths in children, re-
spectively. Limitations of studies include challenges inherent to their ecological design, their execution, and the lack
of robustness of findings to model specifications. High quality research on the association between the implemen-
tation or repeal of firearm legislation (rather than the evaluation of existing laws) and firearm injuries would lead to a
better understanding of what interventions are likely to work given local contexts. This information is key to move this
field forward and for the development of effective policies that may counteract the burden that firearm injuries pose
on populations.

INTRODUCTION
Firearms account for a substantial number of external
causes of death across the world. In 2000, for example, it has
been estimated that globally between 196,000 and 229,000
persons died from nonconflict firearm-related injuries (1).
Global estimates from 2010 indicate that the rates of firearm
homicides and unintentional firearm injuries for this year
were 2.5 and 0.7 per 100,000, respectively (2). Although less
clear estimates for global firearm suicide rates are available,
among high-income countries, the United States has one of
the highest rates (5.8 per 100,000) (3). In the United States,
31,672 persons died from firearm injuries in 2010, at an
age-adjusted rate of 10.1 per 100,000, and this has remained
relatively unchanged since 2000 (4, 5).
Governments around the world have adopted a range of ap-
proaches to regulate the access and use of firearms in the gen-
eral population, aiming to reduce firearm-related crime and
mortality rates (Table 1). The variety of laws is matched by
the diversity of ways in which laws are implemented, the het-
erogeneity in law enforcement efforts, and the severity of
penalties associated with legal violations.
This heterogeneity in approaches and implementation
methods makes it critical to identify approaches that are
less likely to be effective and to identify which strategies,
looking forward, may be more likely to work (5–8). In addi-
tion, examining the associations between specific policies
and firearm-related deaths across countries can improve our
understanding about which types of laws are more likely to
be successful in reducing firearm mortality rates in similar
contexts or within diverse legal frameworks. This review
aimed to examine the association between firearm-related
laws and the rate of firearm-related suicides, homicides,
and unintentional injuries and deaths worldwide. Previous
literature reviews assessing this issue (6–11) have focused
mainly on US studies.

 We conducted a systematic literature review of empirical
studies directly assessing the association between firearm-
related laws at the local, regional, and national levels and
the rate of firearm-related homicides, suicides, and uninten-
tional injuries/deaths. We defined firearm-related laws as any
law on regulations or restrictions on the use, sale, ownership,
storage of firearms, those banning specific types of firearms
or ammunition, those modifying the penalties and sentences
for firearm misuse, and those promoting voluntary rendition
of firearms through buyback programs.
METHODS
We reviewed peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed pub-
lished studies between 1950 and 2014. Given the fact that
laws are enacted and implemented in social contexts and are
not controlled by researchers as in an experimental study,
evidence of the consequences of these laws is likely to be gen-
erated from observational ecological cross-sectional or longi-
tudinal studies. Although these studies have limitations related
to confounding, the uncertainty of a temporal sequence, and
variation in the laws and enforcement across units of observa-
tion, they provide an alternative when it is not feasible to con-
duct randomized controlled trials for policy interventions.
Therefore, our inclusion criteria included observational eco-
logical studies examining the association between firearm-
related laws and firearm-related suicides, homicides, and
unintentional injuries/deaths at the national or local level.
No randomized trials were available on this topic.
We searched the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge
databases to capture evidence from cross-sectional and longi-
tudinal studies in diverse fields including the social, medical,
political, and criminology sciences. We also searched for
studies cited in previous literature reviews and books on
this topic, as well as studies cited in the reference lists of
the original articles identified through our search.
The search was conducted in the English language but cov-
ered studies in other languages (e.g., French, Spanish, or
Portuguese) if abstracts were available in English so they could
be detected in our search or if studies were cited in reviewed
studies. We used keywords/Medical Subject Headings terms
for the searches that included a combination of the following:
1) firearm terms (firearms, weapons, gun, handgun); 2) gun-
control law terms (law enforcement, storage, trafficking, safety,
carry, permit, ban, legislation, regulation, control, formal, back-
ground check, child safety locks, childproof handguns); and
3) health outcome terms (impact, assessment, trends, mortality,
wounds,injuries,suicide,homicide).Wealsosearchedcitations
in primary studies and literature reviews on the topic.
We excluded studies that did not assess the association be-
tween firearm-related laws and homicides, suicides, or unin-
tentional injuries/deaths; studies in which firearm deaths were
reported as part of a combined outcome but specific results
for firearm death rates were not reported; longitudinal studies
reporting only average rate comparisons in pre/post law peri-
ods; or those reporting descriptive changes in rates but not
using any statistical method to compare rates.
A total of 5,039 studies were retrieved by using the Med-
ical Subject Headings/keywords terms in selected search en-
gines: PubMed (n = 1,120), Scopus (n = 2,197), and Web of
Science (n = 1,722). After exclusion of duplicates and those
not meeting the inclusion or exclusion criteria after title
screening (n = 2,861) and after reading the abstract or text
(n = 852), a total of 90 primary studies were identified. In ad-
dition, we identified 40 articles cited in selected studies or in
reviews that met our inclusion or exclusion criteria for a total
of 130 primary studies. A description of the number of stud-
ies that were included or excluded in our study is presented in
Figure 1.
Design suitability and quality of execution of studies were
assessed following criteria from the Guide to Community
Preventive Services (12, 13). Although there are other instru-
ments, such as the environmental health perspectives tool or
the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool, we used the criteria
from this Guide given its applicability to the evaluation of eco-
logical studies and because it has been used to examine studies
on the effectiveness of firearm laws (9). In this review, assess-
ments of studies were conducted by one of the coauthors. Lon-
gitudinal prospective or retrospective cohort studies with a
concurrent comparison group and multiple pre/post interven-
tion measurements were classified as having “greatest” design

parison group but with multiple pre/post intervention mea-
surements were classified as “moderate”; and cross-sectional
studies or longitudinal studies without a concurrent comparison
group and with only single pre/post intervention measurements
or with only postintervention measurements were classified as
“least” design suitability (Web Table 1 available at http://aje.
oxfordjournals.org/). Potential limitations that could threaten
the internal validityof studies are also presented in Web Table 1
(a description of limitations is provided in Table 2).
The reporting and description of findings from included
studies adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Sys-
tematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement
guidelines (14).
FINDINGS
Results are presented and described according to catego-
ries of firearm laws (Table 1) and then according to specific
types of laws within these categories. A summary of different
laws evaluated by studies in this review is provided in Table 3.
A description of studies reviewed here, including data, study
design ratings, results, and potential limitations, is summarized
in the Web Table 1. Most studies used a cross-sectional time-
series design to compare rates and rate trends between pre/post-
law periods. The majority of studies conducted in the United
States compared states with and without laws over time while
controlling for potential confounders. In addition, US cross-
sectional studies frequently used an index of strictness of fire-
arm laws to examine the association between laws and firearm
deaths (Web Table 1). Most international studies assessed the
association between combinations of laws being simulta-
neously implemented and different outcomes using pre/post-
law period comparisons at the national level without a control
group. Of all studies, 47.69% fit the “greatest,” 20% fit the
“moderate,” and 32.31% fit the “least” design criteria.
We also provide a summary of results from some studies in
Figures 2–4. Results are grouped according to the laws being
examined across studies and the different outcomes. A sum-
mary of results for the association between laws restricting
firearm use and homicides is shown in Figure 2. The results
for the association between all other laws and homicides and
suicides/unintentional deaths are shown in Figures 3 and 4,
respectively.
Laws targeting firearms use
Licenses to carry concealed firearms or “shall issue” laws.
These laws allow qualified individuals to carry concealed
firearms (Table 3). In the United States, Lott and Mustard
(15) using a times-series design approach and data from the
Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reports
(UCR) (1977–1992) identified that shall issue laws were as-
sociated with lower rates of homicides at the county and state
levels. Bronars and Lott (16) also noted evidence that shall
issue laws were associated with an apparent increase in the
rate of homicides in adjacent counties without shall issue
laws (16). Seven other studies (17–23) supported Lott and
Mustard’s findings. However, others found inconsistent re-
sults when using different modeling strategies (24–31) and
suggested the presence of errors in the data used in this
study (32). Ayres and Donohue (33–35) used Lott and
Mustard’s data and found, after recoding the data and varying
model specifications, that shall issue laws were not associated
with reductions in homicide rates. Particularly, they demon-
strated that using county data introduced severe bias and that
results were not robust to model specifications (such as in-
cluding more year data or weighting strategies). Wellford
et al. (36) from the National Research Council reached simi-
lar conclusions. In addition, Grambsch (37) found that con-
trolling for regression to the mean diluted the association
between shall issue laws and homicides. Using additional
data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),
Rosengart et al. (38) and Hepburn et al. (39) showed no asso-
ciation between these laws and overall and firearm homicides.
Studies comparing cities with a population of 100,000 or more
(40) and others using samples of large cities in the United
States (41, 42) found similar findings. Another study (43)
looking at injury data from southern Arizona found higher

issue laws.
In recent years, studies by Strnad (44) using a Bayesian ap-
proach and by Moody and Marvell (45, 46), Lott (47), and
Gius (48) showed that shall issue laws were associated with re-
ductions in homicide rates (extending data to 2000). Ayres and

“Shall issue” or “right to carry”
laws (United States)
Different enactment
dates for each
state
These laws allow qualified individuals to carry concealed firearms. Qualified individual
criteria require that eligible individuals have no felony convictions, no pending
domestic violence orders, no drug or alcohol disorders or charges, and no
hospitalizations in a mental institution. Individuals usually must also have American
citizenship, state citizenship, and county residency; have met the minimum age
requirement; and have a certificate of completion of a firearm safety course. In
addition, some states have may-issue laws, which are laws containing language
suggesting that a qualified individual could be denied the permit to carry concealed
firearms (36).
Gun Control Act of 1968
(United States)
October 22, 1968
This law banned the sale of Saturday night specials (handguns), blocked the
importation of firearms that did not meet criteria for being classified for sporting or
scientific purposes, prohibited dealers from shipping firearms to other states and
prohibited the sale of firearms to buyers without state identification, implemented
license requirements for firearm sellers and owners, and banned possession and
purchasing of firearms by minors (under 18 years for rifles and 21 years for
handguns) and high-risk-group individuals (persons convicted of a felony, mental
health problems, or illegal drug users) (147).
Florida felony firearm law
(United States)
October 1, 1975
This law mandated a 3-year sentence for possessing a firearm or destructive device
while committing or attempting to commit any of the specified felonies in the law
(including murder, sexual battery, robbery, burglary, and aggravated assault).
Sentences could not be suspended, deferred, or withheld, and the defendant could
not be eligible for parole until the minimum 3 years had been served (85).
Massachusetts gun control law
(United States)
April 1, 1975
This law mandated a 1-year minimum prison term for the unlicensed carrying of
firearms. In addition, the law required a Firearms Owner Identification card to
own or possess either firearms or ammunition. Sentences could not be suspended,
and the defendant could not be eligible for parole until at least 1 year had been
served (79).
District of Columbia 1976 law
(United States)
July 23, 1976
This law required that every person who owned and had firearms should register
them under the provision of the 1968 law and should reregister them with the
Metropolitan Police Department 60 days after the effective date of the Act. New
rifles and shotguns could be registered if purchased from a licensed dealer and
after passing a background check for criminal records and history of substance
use or mental health problems. The law also strengthened safe storage
requirements, including keeping firearms unloaded or bound by a trigger-locking
device (97, 148).
Michigan Felony Firearm Law
(United States)
February 11, 1976
(effective date:
January 1, 1977)
This law mandated a 2-year sentence for possessing a firearm for felonies committed
with or in possession of firearms. Sentences could not be suspended, deferred, or
withheld, and the defendant could not be eligible for parole until the minimum
2 years had been served (84).
New Jersey “Graves
Amendment” (United States)
February 12, 1981
This law mandated a minimum sentence of imprisonment for any person involved in a
crime who was in possession of a firearm. The minimum sentence also applied to
those convicted of possession of a firearm with intention to use against another
person. Sentences could not be suspended, and the defendant could not be eligible
for parole until the mandatory sentence had been served. The minimum sentence
was one third to one half of the total sentence imposed or 3 years, whichever was
greater, for first, second, and third degree crimes and 18 months for fourth degree
crimes (87).
1986 Detroit law (United
States)
November 26, 1986
This law imposed mandatory jail sentences of 30–90 days and a fine of $100–$500,
depending on whether or not it was a first conviction under the ordinance, on
anyone convicted of unlawfully concealing a pistol or carrying a firearm (88).
1994 Brady Handgun Violence
Prevention Act (United
States)
November 30, 1993
The Brady Act instituted federal background checks on firearm purchasers from a
federally licensed dealer, manufacturer, or importer.
Prohibitions applied to an individual convicted in any court of a crime punishable by
imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year, fugitives from justice, unlawful user of or
addicted to any controlled substance, persons with mental conditions or committed
to a mental institution, a person being unlawfully in the United States, a person with
a court restraining order for domestic violence, or convicted in any court of a
misdemeanor crime of domestic violence (149).
1994 Federal assault weapons
ban (The Public Safety and
Recreational Firearms Use
Protection Act) (United
States)
September 13,
1994
This law banned the manufacture, transfer, sale, and possession of certain
semiautomatic weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines.
Semiautomatic weapons fire a bullet each time the trigger is squeezed, loading the
next bullet after each shot. Weapons already in possession at the time of the law’s
enactment were grandfathered. The law was enacted in 1994 and expired in 2004.
None of the attempts to renew it has prospered (76).
Maryland Gun Violence Act
(United States)
Effective date:
October 1, 1996
This law set stronger restrictions to prevent firearm purchases including background
checks and registration of handguns sold by private gun owners, 1 handgun
purchase per month, and greater authority given to police and judges to confiscate
firearms from domestic violence offenders (77).

The National Firearms Agreement included banning the importation, ownership, sale,
transfer, possession, manufacture, or use of all self-loading center rifles, all
self-loading and pump action shotguns, and all self-loading rim fire rifles. The law
included the following: implementation of a buyback program for prohibited
firearms; mandatory registration of all firearms; licensing requirements proving
genuine reason for owning a firearm; being at least 18 years of age to buy guns; a
28-day waiting period to purchase a firearm; requirement of a separate permit for

percussion) in addition to psychological testing; also, the law required a 3-day
“cooling-off” waiting period for category C and D weapons including long firearms
with a smooth bore and rifled barrels and other semiautomatic long firearms. The
law increased the minimum age to purchase to 21 years and also included safer
firearm storage regulations (123).
Amendment to the Arms Act
(New Zealand)
October 27, 1992
The law required licensing for dealers and licensing for firearm owners that included
the following: passing a test on knowledge of the Firearms Code and rules of firearm
safety; police assessments of the applicant and the applicant’s home that include
checks for firearm storage, security, and social arrangements; and interviews with
2 referees of whom one was a partner or parent in a process that could take
8–12 weeks. The law also included stricter safe storage requirements with
ammunition being kept separately from firearms (125).

county data should not be used. The study by Aneja et al.
(51) that included different model specifications also sug-
gested that shall issue laws were not associated with reduction
of homicides. A summary of study results for the association
between shall issue laws and homicides is shown in Figure 2.
In Colombia, Villaveces et al. (52) examined the associa-
tion between laws banning the carrying of firearms during
weekends after paydays, holidays, and election days in Cali
and Bogota and the rate of homicides. In an interrupted time
series with multiple replications comparing the rates of homi-
cides on days with and without the restriction, these authors
identified a 14% reduction in all homicide rates in Cali during
intervention days compared with days without it. The inter-
vention was associated with a 13% reduction in firearm homi-
cides in Bogota.
“Castle doctrine” laws and “stand your ground” laws.
These laws eliminate the duty to retreat before using lethal
force against an assailant in one’s own home and remove
civil liability for those acting under the principle of self-
defense (Table 3). Lott (47), using time-series models and
data over the 1977–2005 period, observed that castle doctrine
laws were associated with a 9% reduction in homicide rates. In
contrast, Cheng and Hoekstra (53) compared states during the
2000–2010 period using a differences-in-difference approach
(UCR data) and found that these laws were associated with a
6%–11% increase in homicide rates. With a similar approach
to that of Cheng and Hoekstra (53) but using NCHS monthly
data (2000–2010), McClellan and Tekin (54) found that stand
your ground laws were associated with a 6.8% increase in ho-
micide rates, mainly driven by increments (14.7%) in homicide
rates among white males; other self-defense provisions were
not consistently associated with homicides.

 mixed results. Kleck and Patterson (7) used data from 170 US
cities (1979–1981) and found no association between waiting
periods and homicides or suicides; however, firearm purchase
bans for those with mental health conditions were associated
with fewer homicides. Ruddell and Mays (55) using a scale
to rate the state’s ability to screen individuals found that
more stringent background checks were associated with re-
ductions in firearm homicides. Sumner et al. (56) wrote that
local checks (as opposed to federal) for local mental health
and court restraining records were associated with lower sui-
cide rates, but not with homicide rates, among adults aged
21 years or older.
Longitudinal studies have also examined these laws. Lott
and Mustard (15) using time-series analyses and UCR data
from counties and states in the United States found no asso-
ciations between waiting periods and homicide rates at the
state level (inconsistent results at the county level). Similar
findings were previously reported by McDowall et al. (30)
using data from 5 cities. Ludwig and Cook (57) compared
32 “treatment” states directly affected by the Brady Act
against 18 “control” states that already had similar restrictions
(NCHS data, 1985–1997). No associations between the Brady
Act and firearm homicides among adults (aged 21 years or
older and 55 years or older) were observed. However, in
states that included changes in waiting periods, the law was
associated with fewer firearm suicides only among those aged
55 years or older. More recently, Lott (47) using state-level
data found no significant associations between the Brady
Act and homicide rates. In contrast, La Valle (41), compar-
ing 20 large cities in the United States by using UCR data
(1990–2000), found that the Brady Act was associated with
reductions in all and firearm homicide rates.
Other studies examined specific aspects of these laws.

 found that states with laws preventing subjects with domestic
violence restraining orders from owning/purchasing firearms
had a 9% reduction in the rates of intimate partner, female
intimate partner, and female intimate partner firearm homi-
cides; however, there was no association between these
outcomes and restrictions for those convicted of domestic vi-
olence misdemeanors. Zeoli and Webster (60) also described
similar findings using data from 46 of the largest cities in the
United States (1979–2003). In addition, Rodríguez Andrés
and Hempstead (61), using NCHS data from 1995 to 2004,
found that purchasing restrictions for mental health issues
and domestic violence convictions were associated with
lower rates of male suicides in some age groups. Sen and
Panjamapirom (62), using NCHS data from 1996 to 2005,
found that, compared with states checking for criminal back-
grounds only, there were lower homicide rates in states addi-
tionally checking for restraining orders and lower suicide
rates in states also checking for mental conditions, fugitive
status, and misdemeanors.
Particularly on laws regarding licensing of dealers, Kleck
and Patterson (7) in across-sectional study found an association
between these laws and reductions in homicide rates but not in
suicide rates. Moreover, Irvin et al. (63), using NCHS data
(1995–2010) in adjusted models, found that licensing require-
ments for dealers were associated with firearm homicide
reductions.
Laws targeting firearms ownership
Two cross-sectional studies (7, 64) found that permits and
licenses to purchase firearms were associated with lower rates
of firearm suicides. In a longitudinal study using NCHS data
(1970–1998), Marvell (65) found that laws restricting juvenile
access to firearms were not associated with all or firearm homi-
cide or suicide rates among youth. Studies using times-series
analyses from Webster et al. (66) and Rosengart et al. (38)
did not find evidence of reductions in firearm deaths associated
with state and federal laws raising the legal age to 18 or 21
years for handgun purchases/possession. Rodríguez Andrés
and Hempstead (61) in unadjusted models found that minimum
age requirements were associated with fewer suicides among
males.
Interestingly, Webster et al. (67) examined the association
between Missouri’s 2007 repeal of the permit-to-purchase
handgun law, which required all handgun purchasers to have
a valid license to purchase handguns, and homicide rates.

 Using NCHS (1999–2010) and UCR (1999–2012) data, these
authors found that repeal of the law was associated with a
25% increase in firearm homicide rates in Missouri.
In Switzerland, Reisch et al. (68) examined the association
between the national army XXI reform and suicide rates; this
reform reduced by half the number of active soldiers, in-
creased the fee to purchase a military gun, and implemented
license requirements for gun owners (Table 3). The overall
suicide and firearm suicide rates were lower than predicted
among males aged 18–43 years (targeted population), with-
out changes among control groups (women aged 18–44 years
and males aged 44–53 years). In Norway, Gjertsen et al. (69)
examined different firearm laws using piecewise regression
models (1969–2009 data). Their findings suggested that the
1990 restrictions requiring permits for firearm purchases
were the only firearm ownership laws likely contributing to
reductions in suicides rates.
Laws targeting firearms storage regulations
Cummings et al. (70) examined the association between
child access prevention laws and firearm deaths using an eco-
logical time-series design and NCHS data (1979–1994).
These authors found that child access prevention laws were
associated with fewer unintentional firearm deaths among
children under the age of 15 years, but not among older
ones. Results were pronounced in 3 states that allowed felony
prosecution of law offenders, especially Florida and Califor-
nia. Similar results were found by Webster and Starnes (71)
using NCHS data (1979–1997) and Hepburn et al. (72) using
NCHS data (1979–2000) in more complex models, with
Florida driving most of the association (the authors suggest
that the low number of unintentional deaths in some states
may have resulted in limited power to identify significant as-
sociations (72)). Only Lott and Whitley’s (73) study using
UCR data (1977–1996) in time-series weighted tobits analy-
ses found that child access prevention laws were not associ-
ated with unintentional firearm deaths.
Regarding suicides and homicides, no clear association
between child access prevention laws on these outcomes
was observed by Lott and Whitley (73), who indicated
that Poisson models suggested a decline in firearm suicides
and an increment in homicides, or by Lott (47) (with homi-
cides). In contrast, Webster et al. (66) found that child ac-
cess prevention laws were associated with a reduction in all
suicide and firearm suicide rates among individuals aged 14–
17 years (8.3% and 10.8% reduction, respectively) and those
aged 18–20 years (11% and 13%, respectively). Cummings
et al. (70) observed a reduction of 19% in firearm suicides
and 11% in firearm homicides among children aged 15 years
or younger, almost reaching significance (95% confidence in-
tervals: 0.66, 1.01 and 0.76, 1.05, respectively).
Other studies focused on hospital discharge data. A cross-
sectional study by Lee et al. (74) found that child access
prevention laws were associated with increments in firearm
injuries. A longitudinal study by DeSimone et al. (75) using
information from 11 states, of which 7 passed child access
prevention laws between 1988 and 2003, found that child ac-
cess prevention laws were associated with lower nonfatal fire-
arm injuries among individuals under the age of 18 years.
In Norway, Gjertsen et al. (69) found that the 2003 home
guard firearm law implementing safer storage requirements
was likely contributing to reductions in homicide rates among
males.
Laws targeting specific firearms and ammunition
1994 Federal assault weapons ban, United States.
This
law banned the sales and ownership of semiautomatic fire-
arms and large-capacity ammunition magazines. Koper and
Roth (76) using UCR data (1980–1995) found no association
between the law and homicide rates in 15 states after adjust-
ing for the presence of other firearm laws and crime laws in
New York and California. A recent study by Gius (48) showed
that the federal assault weapons ban was associated with
higher rates of firearm homicides.
Saturday night specials, United States.
Saturday night
specials are inexpensive poor-quality guns commonly used
in crime activity. In a cross-sectional study, Kleck and
Patterson (7) found no associations between these laws and
homicide rates. Webster et al. (77) studied the 1988 Maryland
law banning these firearms in time-series analyses using 2
neighboring states as controls and NCHS data (1975–1998).
These authors found the law was associated with a 6.8%–
11.5% reduction in homicide rates when assuming a delayed
effect model but not an immediate and constant model.
Rosengart et al. (38) found no association of the law with re-
ductions in firearm or all homicides rates when assuming an
immediate and constant model. A reduction in suicide rates,
but not in firearm suicide rates, was associated with the law.
The 1988 Victoria state law, Australia.
Ozanne-Smith
et al. (78) examined the Victoria law that tightened restric-
tions on semiautomatic long-arms and pump action guns,
by comparing pre- versus posttrends of annual death rates
in Victoria compared with other states in Australia. The law
was associated with a 17.3% decrease in the rate of firearm
deaths and lower rates of firearm suicides, but not with fire-
arm homicides (78).
Laws targeting sentences and punishment for gun
offenders
Deutsch and Alt (79) examined the 1975 Bartley-Fox
amendment to Massachusetts’ gun control law that mandated
a 1-year minimum prison term for carrying firearms without a
license and a 2-year sentence for crimes committed while in
possession of a firearm. Examining the following 6 months
postimplementation, these authors found no association be-
tween the law and homicide rates. Similar results were ob-
served by Berk et al. (80) and by Hay and McCleary (81)
using UCR data up to 1976. Pierce and Bowers (82) using
other cities as controls and data up to 1976 found a reduction
of 55.7% in the rate of homicides, a reduction not observed in
other control cities. In a posterior study, Deutsch (83) found
the law to be associated with fewer homicides after adding
more years of data.
Loftin and McDowall (84) examined the 1977 Michigan
Felony Firearm Law, with 2-year mandatory sentences for
felonies committed with or in possession of firearms. They
found, in unadjusted autoregressive integrated moving average

 models, that the law was associated with a 10.86% reduction
in the number of firearm homicides in Detroit. These authors
also observed similar results in 1 of 3 cities in Florida in re-
gard to the state felony firearm law (3-year sentence for pos-
sessing a firearm while committing or attempting to commit a
felony) (85) and also reductions in Pittsburgh and Philadel-
phia associated with legislation in Pennsylvania (5-year min-
imum sentence for violent crimes committed with firearms)
(86). Fife and Abrams (87) also found similar results while
examining the 1981 New Jersey “Graves Amendment” re-
quiring minimum sentences of imprisonment without parole
for possessing a firearm while committing a crime. O’Carroll
et al. (88) found that the 1986 Detroit law (mandatory jail
sentence for unlawfully carrying a firearm in public) was as-
sociated with higher rates of firearm indoor and nonfirearm
homicides but not with firearm homicides or those committed
outside.
Marvell and Moody (89) criticized previous studies for not
adjusting models for confounders; in time-series analyses
adjusting for state and year effects and state-level covariates,
they found that laws requiring minimum sentences or addi-
tions to sentences for crimes committed with guns (1970–
1993 data) were not associated with state-level homicide or
firearm homicide rates; they confirmed only Deutsch’s find-
ings for the Massachusetts law (83). La Valle (90), using data
from 20 major cities (1970–2005 data), found that additional
jail time was associated with reductions in firearm homicide
rates, and minimum sentencing enhancements were associ-
ated with higher firearm homicide rates.
With regard to Project Exile from Richmond, Virginia (con-
sidered a sentence enhancement program as felons arrested for
gun possession were brought to federal courts where sentences
were more severe), Raphael and Ludwig (91) using UCR data
(1994–1999) did not find strong evidence suggesting that the
program was associated with reductions in firearm homicide
rates once 1997 (a year with unusual high rates) was excluded.
Rosenfeld et al. (92) added more years (1992–2001) and used
adjusted multilevel models, and they observed a 22% yearly
reduction in firearm homicides; however, this reduction was
only marginal (P < 0.10) when 1997 was excluded and re-
placed by the average of 1996 and 1998 values.
Laws promoting voluntary rendition of firearms
Rosenfeld (93) found no association between firearm buy-
back programs implemented in St. Louis, Missouri (1991 and
1994) and firearm homicides. More recently, Phillips et al.
(94) found that yearly firearm buyback programs imple-
mented in Buffalo, New York, from 2007 to 2012 were not
associated with reductions in firearm homicides. Leigh and
Neill (95) evaluated the 1997 Australian gun buyback pro-
gram and found no association between the program and fire-
arm homicides but a reduction in suicide rates associated with
the number of firearms that were bought back.
Simultaneous implementation of laws targeting multiple
elements of regulations
US Gun Control Act of 1968.
This law restricted the sale
of some handguns, blocked the importation of firearms not
meeting specific criteria, prohibited the sale of firearms to
buyers without state identification, implemented licenses
for firearm sellers and for owners, and banned the posses-
sion/purchasing of firearms by high-risk-group individuals
(Table 3). Magaddino and Medoff (96), using data for the pe-
riod 1947–1977 in structural models adjusted by state charac-
teristics, found that the law was not associated with changes
in homicide rates.
District of Columbia 1976 law.
This law banned residents
from owning automatic and semiautomatic firearms and hand-
guns, placed stronger requirements for home firearm storage,
and required registration of all firearms. Loftin et al. (97),
using NCHS data (1968–1987) from the District of Columbia
and adjacent metropolitan areas of Maryland and Virginia,
found an abrupt reduction in homicide and suicide rates
with no similar changes in control areas. Similar results for
suicides were found by McDowall et al. (98) comparing the
District of Columbia with Boston, Massachusetts, Memphis,
Tennessee, and Baltimore, Maryland. Britt et al. (99, 100)
questioned the selection of controls in the study by Loftin
et al. (97), given the differences in homicide rates in the pre-
law period; using Baltimore as the control area, Britt et al.
found that the law was not associated with abrupt or gradual
changes in homicide rates (no estimates for the law-suicide
rates association were reported).
1996 Maryland Gun Violence Act.
This law set stronger
regulations including background checks and registration of
handguns sold by private gun owners, 1 handgun purchase per
month, and greater authority given to police and judges to
confiscatefirearmsfromdomesticviolenceoffenders.Webster
et al. (77) examined the law in models adjusted for sociode-
mographics and trends in neighboring states (1975–1998
NCHS data) and found that the law was associated with re-
ductions (from 10.3% to 11.4%) in firearm homicide rates
in Maryland, assuming an immediate or delayed start, and
constant/gradual effects.
Canadian firearm-related bills.
Table 3 contains a sum-
mary of the 3 Canadian firearm bills. Regarding the variabil-
ity in homicides rates, Leenaars and Lester (101) found that
the 1977 bill C-51 was no longer associated with reductions
in firearm homicide rates, as previously suggested (102, 103),
after controlling for other socioeconomic indicators (101);
however, reductions in homicide rates remained associated
with the bill (101). Mauser and Holmes (104) found no asso-
ciations between bill C-51 and all homicides in dummy mod-
els adjusted for covariates and time trends. Blais et al. (105)
in models adjusted for potential confounders (1974–2004
data) found that bill C-51 was associated with reductions in
firearm homicide rates. In this study, bill C-17 from 1991 was
not associated with all or firearm homicides, but bill C-68
from 1995 was associated with lower firearm homicide rates.
More recently, Langmann (106) analyzed data from 1974
to 2008 using different modeling strategies and found no as-
sociation of any of the 3 bills with firearm homicide rates and
also no association between bills C-17 and C-68 and spousal
firearm homicide rates (results for bill C-51 on this outcome
were not provided). Using a similar approach, McPhedran
and Mauser (107) found no associations between bill C-68
and firearm female homicides, but bill C-51 was associated
with reductions in firearm female domestic homicides.

 Studies on the association between the Canadian bills and
suicide rates are also described. Unadjusted studies comparing
pre- versus postlaw trend slopes showed that lower suicide
(108) and firearm suicide (103, 109) rates were associated
with bill C-51. Although the association with firearm suicides
was diluted after adjusting for divorce and unemployment
rates (102), additional analyses assessing trends in pre/post
intervention periods and models adjusting for additional fac-
tors showed that bill C-51 reversed a prior steep increase in
firearm suicides; further, although the bill was associated
with lower firearm suicide rates in the population and among
males and females (110), there was evidence of males switch-
ing to other methods.
Caron et al. (111), using Quebec, Canada, data (1987–
2001), found that bill C-17 was not associated with changes
in firearm suicide rates; an increment in the rates of suicides
by hanging was observed among females. Gagné et al. (112)
using Quebec data (1981–2006) in Joinpoint regressions
found a breakpoint in 1996 indicating reductions in firearm
suicides among males and individuals aged 15–34 years. Re-
sults from Poisson regressions showed reductions in suicide
rates when the anticipated effect of bill C-17 was moved to
1995 (112). Similar results were identified by Cheung and
Dewa (113) for firearm suicides after 1994. These 3 studies
found that suicides due to hanging increased and that the rate
of overall suicides did not change over time, which is sugges-
tive of individuals switching to substitution methods.
Regarding unintentional firearm deaths, Leenaars and
Lester (114) using national data (1969–1985) in models ad-
justed by unemployment and divorce rates, initially found bill
C-51 was only marginally associated with lower death rates
among males; later the authors found the bill was also asso-
ciated with lower death rates in the entire population (102).
The 1996 National Firearms Agreement (NFA) and the
South Australia Firearms Act.
A summary of these laws is
provided in Table 3. In regards to homicide rates, Ozanne-
Smith et al. (78) examined the NFA using Victoria as a con-
trol group, given that this state had previously enacted firearm
restrictions in 1988. The authors found a reduction (14%) in
overall firearm death rates in states implementing NFA re-
strictions relative to Victoria (78). Another study by Chapman
et al. (115), analyzed data from 1979 to 2003 and found ev-
idence of an acceleration in the reduction in firearm deaths
and all homicides after the passing of the law; although
there was also a steeper reduction in firearm homicides, the
trend ratio was not significant. In addition, no firearm mass
shootings occurred in Australia after the NFA compared
with 13 in the prelaw period (115). In contrast, Baker and
McPhedran (116) compared observed versus predicted homi-
cide rates after the NFA (1979–2004 data) in autoregressive
integrated moving average models and found no association
between the law and homicide rates, although the downward
trend was observed to continue in the years after the law. Neill
and Leigh (117) criticized Baker and McPhedran (116) for
not using the log of death rates (which made expected rates
become negative). Adjusting for new model specifications,
they found a reduction in the firearm homicide rates associ-
ated with the NFA (117).
Lee and Suardi (118), using data from 1915 to 2004 and tests
of unknown structural breaks, found no evidence suggesting
that the NFA was associated with reduction in homicides or
suicide rates. In contrast, Chapman et al. (115) showed reduc-
tions in the rate of firearm and total suicide rates after the im-
plementation of the NFA. Similar results were observed by
Neill and Leigh (117) and by Baker and McPhedran (116)
for firearm suicides. McPhedran and Baker (119), using an
approach similar to that of Lee and Suardi (118), also identi-
fied a breakpoint in 1997 for firearm suicide rates but only for
individuals aged 35–44 years (although no association was
found in other models). Klieve et al. (120), examining data
from the Queensland suicide register (1990–2004) and na-
tional data (1968–2004), found that the NFA was associated
with negative trends in firearm suicide rates at the national
level, but not with suicides among males in Queensland.
In regard to the 1977 South Australia Firearms Act,
Snowdon and Harris (121) using data from Australian states
(1968–1989) observed that the law was associated with lower
rates of firearm suicides.
Finally, in regard to unintentional firearm death rates,
Bakerand McPhedran (116)and Chapman etal. (115) showed
an increment in the rate of unintentional firearm deaths asso-
ciated with the NFA (115), although they conclude that rates
can be greatly affected by small changes in the number of an-
nual cases given that unintentional firearm deaths are rare
events.
The Estatuto do Desarmamento in Brazil.
This law tight-
ened restrictions on the possession of firearms and ammuni-
tion, implemented requirements for the registration of owned
firearms, increased firearm costs, and established stronger
penalties for illegal trafficking of firearms (Table 3). Marinho
de Souza et al. (122), using time-series models (1996–2004
data) found that observed deaths were lower than predicted
ones in the next 6 postlaw months.
The 1997 Austrian firearm law.
This law placed restric-
tions for some firearms (including handguns and semiauto-
matics) and mandated background checks, minimum age
requirements for purchases, safer firearm storage regulations,
and waiting periods (Table 3). Kapusta et al. (123), using data
from 1985 to 2005, found that the law was associated with
reductions in firearm homicide (percent change in trends in
pre/postlaw periods = −4.8) and firearm suicide (percent
change = −9.9) rates in models adjusted for unemployment
and alcohol consumption. Moreover, Niederkrotenthaler
et al. (124) found that the law was associated with a long-term
reduction in the rate of firearm suicides and the proportion of
firearm suicides among adolescents (aged 10–19 years).
The New Zealand Amendment to the Arms Act.
The law
included bans on certain firearms, licensing for dealers and
firearm owners that required passing training tests, police as-
sessments of applicant and applicant’s home, and interviews
with family members. Beautrais et al. (125), using Poisson
models and interrupted time-series analyses (1985–2002
data), found that the amendment was associated with reduc-
tions in the rate of firearm suicides among those aged 15–24
and 25 years or older, but not with reductions in all suicides.
South Africa’s Firearms Control Act.
This law banned cer-
tain firearms (including automatic guns), required an addi-
tional license per each gun owned and passing training tests
to obtain licenses, increased age requirements for possession/
purchase of firearms, and mandated background checks

 (Table 3). Matzopoulos et al. (126) evaluated the association
between the Act and changes in homicide rates in 5 major cit-
ies (2001–2005 data). Results showed a decreasing trend
(13.6% per year) for firearm homicides through the imple-
mentation of the program and until 1 year after the law was
fully implemented. Reductions in nonfirearm homicides were
also observed, although not as pronounced as the ones ob-
served for firearm homicides.
Additional studies comparing states/cities with a
classification based on degrees of firearm law strictness
In regard to homicide rates, studies from the 1960s found
little evidence of laws affecting homicide rates. Geisel et al.
(127) compared states and major cities (1960–1965 data) and
found that stricter laws were not associated with homicide
rates. Magaddino and Medoff (96) and others (128–130) ex-
amined state and federal laws (requirements for sales and pur-
chases) using data from 1960 and 1970, and they observed
that associations between laws and homicide rates vanished
after controlling for sociodemographic factors. A study by
Seitz (131) (1967 data) showed that states with carrying and
purchasing prohibitions had lower homicide rates among
whites. Recent studies found that states/cities with stricter
laws had lower rates of homicides (132), firearm deaths
(133–135), and firearm injuries (136). Fleegler et al. (137),
using a legislative strength score, found that states with scores
in the highest quartile (more restrictive) compared with those
in the lowest quartile had lower rates of firearm homicides.
In regard to variations in suicide rates, Geisel et al. (127)
and other authors (129, 138–141) reported that stricter laws
were associated with lower rates of suicides and unintentional
death rates; however, other authors described that these asso-
ciations vanished when models were adjusted for confound-
ers (128, 130). Boor and Bair (142) (1985 data) found that
stricter firearm laws were associated with reductions in sui-
cide rates. Sloan et al. (143) while comparing 2 cities also
found similar results for firearm suicides. In addition, Conner
and Zhong (144) classified states according to strictness
(1999–2000 data) and found lower suicide rates among males
and females in states with stricter laws. Fleegler et al. (137)
also identified lower firearm suicides in states in the highest
quartile (most strict).
CONCLUSIONS
In a comprehensive review of firearm-control legislation
worldwide, we identified a range of studies examining the as-
sociation between firearm-related laws and firearm deaths.
Three general observations emerge from this analysis:
1) The simultaneous implementation of laws targeting multi-
ple elements of firearms regulations reduced firearm-related
deaths in certain countries; 2) some specific restrictions on
purchase, access, and use of firearms are associated with re-
ductions in firearm deaths; 3) challenges in ecological design
and the execution of studies limit the confidence in study
findings and the conclusions that can be derived from them.
A variety of longitudinal studies describe the association
between the simultaneous implementation of laws targeting
multiple elements of regulations and firearm deaths. Despite
their limitations, specifically on the identification of which
laws are more likely to be effective, these studies inform on
the potential synergistic effects, or the aggregated individual
effects of multiple laws, when they are simultaneously imple-
mented within a narrow time window. The Australian NFA
provides a good illustration of this. Following the implemen-
tation of the NFA, a decline in firearm deaths and firearm sui-
cides, as well as an absence of mass shootings (78, 115, 117,
120), occurred. We found similar findings in other studies ex-
amining legislation targeting multiple elements of regula-
tions in other countries (122–126), although, except in the
case of Austria, findings have not been replicated. In Canada,
although there has been a continuous downward trend in fire-
arm death rates over time and legislation including back-
ground checks has been associated with fewer female firearm
homicides, evidence of the association between these laws and
overall homicides is mixed. Moreover, studies from Canada,
New Zealand, and Australia (at least for the first post-NFA
years) show that observed reductions in firearm suicides,
after the implementation of these laws, were compensated by
substitution methods that resulted in no significant changes in
overall suicide rates.
There is also compelling evidence of specific laws being
associated with reductions in the rate of firearm deaths. Stud-
ies on background checks suggest that the quality of systems
used to review applicants, in terms of the access to local and
federal information on mental health conditions and criminal
and domestic violence history, is a critical component of
these laws. However, in some longitudinal studies, little at-
tention is given to whether states conducted local checks
and how results would vary after adjusting models for this.
US studies examining more detailed aspects of background
check laws describe how requiring checks on restraining or-
ders is associated with reductions in intimate partner female
firearm homicides, and how checking local mental health fa-
cility records is linked to fewer firearm suicides. Regarding
child access prevention laws, most studies in the United
States show that additional laws allowing for felony prosecu-
tion of offenders are associated with greater reductions in un-
intentional deaths among children. In addition, most studies
show that relaxing firearm restrictions, as in the case of “stand
your ground” laws or the repealing of existing permit laws,
may increase the rate of firearm homicides. We also found in-
ternational evidence suggesting that, in a particular setting
with high rates of homicides, banning the carrying of firearms
on sensitive days along with police enforcement can be an ef-
fective strategy to reduce homicide rates.
In contrast, evidence suggests that laws restricting the sales
of certain firearms are not associated with variations in all or
firearm homicides. In this regard, it is possible that because of
the fact that studies examine short periods after the laws are
implemented, studies may not be able to identify a significant
association, as the effects of these laws are more likely to be
gradual and delayed given the already high rate of firearms
ownership and the availability of firearms in secondary mar-
kets. A similar situation may occur for studies with short
postlaw periods examining laws targeting sentences for gun
offenders, as described for studies on the 1975 Massachu-
setts’ law. In addition, for laws targeting sentences, variations
in the restrictions and the types of sentence in states, and also

 the interactions with other factors, such as law enforcement
and limitations in jail space, may explain the different results
across regions and studies.
One potential problem of studies on firearms laws is the
way in which the author’s affiliations and personal interests
bias study results and influence what is to be published.
This can be particularly problematic when researchers are
funded by for-or-against firearms groups and when these or-
ganizations have control of what material is publishable and
what is not, and also when researchers purposely select to
present only the results that match their interests. In this re-
view, we have avoided making statements on sources of fund-
ing or on affiliations of authors, although we acknowledge
that this is an important problem that may distort the general
information that could be obtained from this review, and that
may contribute to publication bias.
In addition, the studies reviewed here may suffer from va-
lidity problems that are common in observational ecological
studies. In this regard, cross-sectional studies are of least de-
sign suitability (145), and although useful for hypothesis
generation, they offer little information on which laws are
more likely to work in certain settings. Alternatively, longi-
tudinal studies, especially those examining changes in out-
comes before and after the legislation and those including
control groups, offer stronger evidence. Longitudinal studies
looking at local policy changes, although less generalizable,
may provide more precise information on factors necessary
for interventions to work compared with those using national
aggregated data. However, we observe that incomplete or
missing data or problems in quality of the data challenge the
evaluation of laws at local levels. Additional concerns of
validity, even in longitudinal designs, include the lack of
robustness of findings to modeling specifications, such as re-
garding the use of more years of data or moving the expected
point of the intervention effect. Also, particular challenges
in study execution include specifications that control for po-
tential confounders that can also be mediators (e.g., firearm
ownership). Researchers adjusting for these variables with-
out acknowledging the presence of mediating effects can
wrongly conclude that these laws are not associated with the
outcomes.
While identifying the limitations of designs and the execu-
tion of studies reviewed here, we also identified opportunities
for future research. First, studies focusing on the association
between the relaxation of firearms laws, such as Missouri’s
repeal of permits law and the “stand your ground” law, and
firearm-related deaths provide an alternative angle to evaluate
firearm legislation. Research in this direction may be able to
identify more abrupt changes in firearm mortality compared
with research on the implementation of new laws, which in
theory would have more gradual and delayed effects (67).
Second, limited availability and quality of injury data have
driven most research to focus on firearm deaths, the most ex-
treme outcome. Better data to assess changes in firearm in-
juries at both the national and state levels could improve
our knowledge on the consequences of firearm laws with a
broader scope. Third, we found that few studies have exam-
ined how these laws are associated with outcomes among
particular ethnic/racial or lower socioeconomic groups; fo-
cusing on subgroup outcomes would help to identify which
laws may be most beneficial to those at greater risk. Fourth, re-
search is needed to understand how the enactment or repeal of
firearms laws is associated with changes in social attitudes,
norms, and behaviors and how this in turn is associated with
firearms deaths. Fifth, there is little research using complex sys-
tems approaches to identify or predict variations in firearm
deaths when single or multiple laws are implemented and
how the magnitude of associations would vary in the presence
of other factors (e.g., enforcement). As these methods evolve,
they may become an avenue to explore the benefits and disad-
vantages associated with firearms laws and other alternatives in
different population contexts. There are also unanswered ques-
tions on whether new alternatives, not directly targeting firearm
rights, such as increments in firearm taxation, safer manufac-
turing of firearms, or background checks for all private sales,
can be effective in reducing firearm-related death rates.
To conclude, we have provided an overview of national
and international studies on the association between firearm-
related laws and firearm injuries/deaths. High-quality re-
search overcoming limitations of existing studies in this field
would lead to a better understanding of what interventions are
more likely to work given local contexts. This information is
key for policy development aiming at reducing the burden
posed to populations worldwide by violent and unintentional
firearm injuries.
