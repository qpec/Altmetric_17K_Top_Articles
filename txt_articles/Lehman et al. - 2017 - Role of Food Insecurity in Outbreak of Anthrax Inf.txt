 In September 2011, a total of 511 human cases of anthrax 
(Bacillus anthracis) infection and 5 deaths were reported in 
a game management area in the district of Chama, Zambia, 
near where 85 hippopotamuses (Hippopotamus amphibi-
ous) had recently died of suspected anthrax. The human 
infections generally responded to antibiotics. To clarify 
transmission, we conducted a cross-sectional, interviewer-
administered household survey in villages where human 
anthrax cases and hippopotamus deaths were reported. 
Among 284 respondents, 84% ate hippopotamus meat 
before the outbreak. Eating, carrying, and preparing meat 
were associated with anthrax infection. Despite the risk, 
23% of respondents reported they would eat meat from hip-
popotamuses found dead again because of food shortage 
(73%), lack of meat (12%), hunger (7%), and protein short-
age (5%). Chronic food insecurity can lead to consumption 
of unsafe foods, leaving communities susceptible to zoo-
notic infection. Interagency cooperation is necessary to pre-
vent outbreaks by addressing the root cause of exposure, 
such as food insecurity.
D
uring August–September 2011, a total of 85 hippopota-
muses (Hippopotamus amphibious) died of suspected 
anthrax (Bacillus anthracis) infection in a game manage-
ment area along the South Luangwa River near the district 
of Chama in northeastern Zambia (Figure 1) (1). At least 521 
suspected human anthrax cases and 5 deaths were reported 
near this area during this period. Residents of the area near 
the river had reportedly found dead hippopotamuses and 
subsequently butchered, cooked, and consumed meat from 
the dead animals, which was thought to be the cause of the 
human outbreak. As previously reported, most human cases 
of anthrax infection were cutaneous infections, with most 
patients initially having papular lesions (95%) and the rest 
having lymphadenopathy and gastrointestinal symptoms (1). 
Most cases resolved after the patient received a course of 
oral ciprofloxacin. Some additional animal species were re-
ported by local wildlife staff to have been affected, but no 
empiric data were found to corroborate those reports.
Anthrax outbreaks associated with animals are com-
mon and reported worldwide. Herbivores are thought to 
have onset of disease after ingesting spores in soil, water, 
or on vegetation. Reports of anthrax outbreaks occurring in 
wild and domestic animals in Africa have usually been as-
sociated with the dry season and have stopped with the on-
set of the rainy season (2,3). Outbreaks can begin with wild-
life, expand into domestic livestock, and ultimately affect 
humans (4,5). When anthrax outbreaks occur in national 
parks in Africa and are limited to the wildlife, the outbreak 
is usually allowed to run its natural course without any hu-
man intervention. Multiple challenges make it impractical 
to vaccinate free-ranging wildlife populations; sometimes 
vaccine programs are initiated but usually only to protect 
endangered species or populations at high risk (6–8).
Anthrax outbreaks associated with hippopotamuses 
have been reported previously in Zambia, Uganda, Zimba-
bwe, and South Africa (3,9–11). Human cases associated 
with wildlife outbreaks in Africa are generally not well-
documented but are known to occur (5).

 RESEARCH
Zambia’s Chama District (population 103,894) borders 
Malawi, in what is currently known as Muchinga Province 
(Figure 1) (12). Nearly 93% of the district’s residents live 
in rural areas, and overall population density is 5.9 persons/
km2 (12). The rural population resides in small villages 
largely accessible only by all-terrain vehicles. Communi-
cation in many parts of the district is only possible through 
2-way radios. Chama is within a game management area 
that includes the South Luangwa River and contains rich 
flora and fauna, including hippopotamuses but also other 
foragers and predators. Because of Chama’s status as a 
game management area, residents are not permitted to pro-
tect crops from foragers or hunt on area grounds, which 
are overseen by the Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA). 
Food and water are scarce for animals and humans during 
Zambia’s dry season, generally May–November. A delay 
in the annual rainy season, usually December–March, can 
put farmers at risk for low crop production, as was the case 
in 2011 (13). During this period, animals forage deep into 
riverbeds in search of water and food, digging up and acti-
vating dormant anthrax spores. Residents, for whom food 
can also be scarce under these conditions, have been known 
to consume animals they find dead in their area (Figure 2).
In September 2011, a few months after the first hu-
man anthrax cases were reported in the district, a team of 
epidemiologists, health officers, and environmental health 
technicians from the Zambia Central Ministry of Health, 
the Eastern Provincial Health Office, and Chama District 
Health Office conducted a preliminary investigation of the 
possible outbreak under their jurisdiction. Shortly thereaf-
ter, upon formal request, epidemiologists from the US Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention joined the Zambia 
team to conduct this outbreak investigation in an effort to 
further inform prevention activities.
Specifically, we aimed to shorten the outbreak by 
identifying and eliminating any remaining exposures and 
by recommending mitigation and prevention strategies for 
this and future outbreaks. We also wanted to determine the 
riskiest exposures so that educational messages could be 
properly tailored. Here we report the results of a house-
hold survey used to identify the most common exposures 
associated with human anthrax and to determine how food 
insecurity contributed to consumption of the anthrax-con-
taminated meat and anthrax infection among residents of 
this game management area.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional, interviewer-administered 
household survey in 3 villages with access to riverbeds where 
hippopotamuses died: Chikwa, Chigoma, and Chimpamaba.

 Anthrax among Humans and Hippopotamuses, Zambia
These villages’ estimated combined population of adults >15 
years of age is 6,553 (12). A questionnaire (online Techni-
cal Appendix, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/23/9/16-
1597-Techapp1.pdf) was developed in English and trans-
lated into Senga, the local language spoken in these areas. 
The questionnaire was designed to complement and expand 
on the data initially collected in the district by local public 
health officials. It captured age, sex, and occupation and yes/
no responses to several questions about symptoms, exposure 
to hippopotamuses, food sources, and whether respondents 
would eat meat from an animal they found dead. Those 
who responded that they would eat animals they found dead 
were asked an open-ended question to elucidate their rea-
sons for doing so. Interviewers and supervisors were trained 
on procedures for conducting the survey before fieldwork 
commenced. Interviewers and supervisors tested questions 
on each other, which resulted in improvements to question 
wording. They also practiced administering the survey on 
one another before interviewing community participants.
Three teams administered the questionnaire, each team 
made up of a trained District Health Office staff supervi-
sor and 6 trained volunteer interviewers. Each team was 
assigned to 1 of the 3 communities. Interviewers selected 
every fifth household they encountered in each village for 
inclusion and interviewed all adults >15 years of age living 
in selected households. No incentives were offered for par-
ticipation. Interviewers read each prospective participant a 
description of the survey, highlighting that it was voluntary 
and could be stopped at any time by request. The Zambia 
Ministry of Health deemed this outbreak investigation to 
be exempt from Research Ethics Committee review. The 
investigation protocol was reviewed by the CDC-Zambia 
office and CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoo-
notic Infectious Diseases, in accordance with institutional 
review policies. The protocol was determined to be non-
research under 45 CFR 46 §102(d) and therefore did not 
require Institutional Review Board review.
Data from completed questionnaires were entered into 
an Access database (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) and 
analyzed by using Epi Info version 3.5.1 (CDC, Atlanta, 
GA, USA). We defined a case as illness in a respondent 
who reported having had anthrax infection diagnosed by 
a healthcare worker since July 2011 and compared demo-
graphic characteristics and risk factors by case status by us-
ing χ2 and t tests. Associations were quantified with simple 
and multivariable logistic regression.
The second part of the investigation involved going 
into the field to view 3 of the areas where most of the in-
fected hippopotamuses were found. The site visits occurred 
within about a month after the outbreak and were conduct-
ed to better understand the topography and the range of the 
animals and to identify any additional animal species af-
fected by anthrax. All sites were areas frequented by the ex-
posed human populations and were <1 km from residents’ 
homes. The site surveys were not exhaustive; they focused 
on areas with known human-animal interaction (Figure 
3) and recently discovered dead hippopotamuses (Figure 
4). N95 masks, Tyvek suits, and rubber boots were worn

during site visits when members exited vehicles. We used 
these observations and the results of the household-level 
surveys to develop recommendations to mitigate and con-
trol future spread of the infection to humans, animals, and 
the environment.
Results
All 284 household members (≈4% of the population of the 
villages) in the 87 households selected agreed to be inter-
viewed (mean 3 participants per household). In total, 31 
(11%) of participants reported having anthrax infection di-
agnosed by a healthcare worker since July 2011; another 
137 (48%) reported not having anthrax infection diag-
nosed, and 116 (41%) did not know whether they had an-
thrax infection diagnosed. We assumed that those who did 
not know did not have anthrax infection diagnosed. Male 
respondents accounted for 48% (n = 136) of total partici-
pants but 68% (n = 21) of those reporting having anthrax 
infection diagnosed, compared with 36% of cases occurring 
among female respondents (p<0.001) (Table 1). Of the 96 
persons who answered the occupation-related question, 91 
(95%) listed their occupation as farmer. This finding was 
not surprising given the rural setting of the outbreak. Be-
cause the responses for occupation were so homogenous, 
occupation was not evaluated as a risk factor. The median 
age of persons having received an anthrax diagnosis since 
July 2011 was 33 years, similar to the median age of all 
participants (32 years) (Table 1). The most common signs 
and symptoms reported by those reporting having been di-
agnosed with anthrax included myalgia, skin lesions, fa-
tigue, diarrhea, and fever (Table 2).
Most participants (238 [84%]) reported having eaten 
hippopotamus meat at the time of the outbreak. Participants 
who ate the meat were 9 times (95% CI 1.3–369.3 times) 
more likely to report having had anthrax than those who 
did not eat the meat. Carrying hippopotamus meat (odds 
ratio 5.3, 95% CI 2.0–15.4) and preparing it for cooking 
(odds ratio 3.3, 95% CI 1.1–13.7) were also significantly 
associated with anthrax infection. After controlling for 
having eaten the hippopotamus meat, 3 activities (skinning, 
carrying, and cutting the meat) were all still significantly 
associated with reported anthrax infection (Table 3).
Most people surveyed (216 [76%]) reported they 
would not eat meat from a dead hippopotamus knowing 
now that it can cause anthrax infection, but 65 (23%) of all 
respondents and 5 (16%) of the 31 respondents in whom 
cases were reported said that they would eat meat from a 
dead hippopotamus despite this knowledge. Of the 65 par-
ticipants saying they would eat the meat if given the chance 
again, reasons given were because they lacked other op-
tions for a side dish (“relish”) to Nshima, the maize-based 
staple food (44 [73%]); lacked meat (14 [22%]); suffered 
from hunger (4 [7%]); or lacked protein (3 [5%]), in ad-
dition to other less commonly reported reasons (Table 4).
The investigation team also visited several field sites. 
At 1 of the sites, previous human interaction with dead hip-
popotamuses was evident. Bones and hides were strewn 
across a large area. Evidence of multiple campfires were 
found in the vicinity of the hippopotamus remains (Figure 
3). According to a Zambia Ministry of Health official and 
others on the investigation team who had visited the site 
earlier, the strewn animal parts appeared to have been from 
the initial human contact with the dead hippopotamuses. 
Residents appeared to stop handling dead hippopotamuses 
after human anthrax cases were detected and linked to con-
tact with hippopotamus carcasses.
Discussion
A large outbreak of cutaneous anthrax among humans in 
the Chama District of Zambia was associated with physi-
cal contact with meat from hippopotamuses that had died 
of anthrax, specifically skinning, carrying, or cutting the 
meat. Food insecurity was thought to have been the major 
factor driving the local population to consume meat from 
dead animals.
Large outbreaks affecting hippopotamus herds oc-
curred within the Luangwa River Valley during 1987–1988 
(7). Although no human infections were reported in rela-
tion to these outbreaks, positive results with low antibody 
titers against B. anthracis were obtained during a 1989 
follow-up study from half of the subjects in a small sample 
of unvaccinated healthy volunteers from Luangwa River 
Valley villages, suggesting previous exposures in those 
persons through handling or consumption of meat from 
anthrax-infected animal carcasses (7).
Our findings are subject to a few limitations. In the 
household surveys, we used self-report of anthrax diagno-
sis to define a case; however, 41% of participants indicated

they did not know whether they had received an anthrax 
diagnosis. We assumed that these respondents might not 
have understood the question and had probably not had an-
thrax diagnosed. Although this assumption is a limitation, 
it would probably bias our associations toward the null. We 
also had to use self-report of diagnosis rather than laborato-
ry confirmation. However, separately some hippopotamus 
 
and human samples were confirmed in the laboratory as 
positive for B. anthracis, which does strengthen the epide-
miologic linkage (14). Finally, slight discrepancies can be 
noted in the number of cases and hippopotamus deaths in 
this and the 2 other reports describing other aspects of the 
outbreak and response that have been published; specifi-
cally, the numbers of human cases vary from 511 to 521, 
and the numbers of hippopotamus deaths vary from 81 to 
85 (14,15). This discrepancy likely illustrates the difficulty 
in describing events in very remote areas.
From this investigation we found that the greatest risk 
for having anthrax diagnosed came from carrying, skin-
ning, or butchering hippopotamuses. This finding is consis-
tent with other anthrax outbreaks associated with contami-
nated meat (11,16).
Recommendations from this investigation built on the 
initial response of the Zambia Ministry of Health and in-
cluded community education, enhanced surveillance in hu-
man and animal populations, and resolution of food insecu-
rities by working with governmental and nongovernmental 
agencies. The message to not eat meat from animals found 
dead was communicated at the time of the initial investiga-
tion. On the basis of survey responses indicating persons 
were no longer touching the meat and that carcasses were 
no longer being butchered, we think the messages were re-
ceived and understood by the communities affected. Be-
cause the handling of the carcasses proved to be the most 
important risk factor for anthrax infection, future education 
campaigns should also focus on avoiding handling animals 
that have died of unknown causes. In rural Zimbabwe com-
munities where anthrax awareness was high (71.5%) in a 
2013 survey, 41% of persons surveyed reported “forget-
ting about anthrax,” a major reason for consuming meat 
from anthrax-infected animals (17). Residents should be 
reminded by community-based awareness campaigns or 
other means of the hazards of consuming meat from ani-
mals that have died of unknown causes (15).
To inform planning, wildlife authorities should 
identify high-risk periods and locations for naturally oc-
curring animal outbreaks through ecologic studies that 
identify conditions favoring anthrax infection among 
animal populations (18–20). Wildlife and public health 
authorities should work together to ensure that commu-
nity-based campaigns proactively prepare communities 
for possible outbreaks according to their risk profile 
(20). Community-based interventions should involve 
residents in addressing communitywide food insecurity 
and in educating neighbors on the hazards of consum-
ing meat from animals that die of unknown causes (16). 
These interventions should begin before the dry season 
in outbreak-prone areas.
Questionnaire responses showed that food insecuri-
ties appear to be the primary reason for handling and 
consuming meat from animals found dead. Other coun-
tries in Africa have undertaken successful programs to 
distribute meat from trophy animals to feed communi-
ties with limited access to protein while also reducing 
poaching by local communities (21). Such an approach 
might be considered as a component of a multisectoral 
solution to address food insecurity and consumption of 
unsafe foods in Zambia.
Overall, food insecurity throughout sub-Saharan Af-
rica has improved throughout recent years; however, hun-
ger and malnutrition continue to be concerns in many sub-
Saharan countries including Zambia. Zambia maintains a

food reserve of maize, and it was suggested throughout the 
investigation that officials should provide additional corn 
meal as a possible solution for the food shortage. However, 
populations at risk for food insecurity need better access 
to balanced diets rather than more carbohydrates (22). Our 
survey respondents highlighted the desire for more fresh 
fruits and vegetables, which suggests more balanced diets 
would be welcomed.
Most of the crops grown in this region were cotton and 
other nonedible, exportable crops. Assistance is needed 
to help the population better balance subsistence farming 
with cash crops on small family farms to improve the over-
all diversity of crops and ultimately mitigate the risk for 
 
food insecurity (22).
Our household survey aimed to determine the main 
risk factors for anthrax transmission and the underlying 
factors driving those infected to risk exposure. Our results 
suggest the need to address long-standing political and eco-
nomic issues related to food insecurity in protected areas, 
as well as an urgent need for better coordination between 
wildlife management and public health authorities. A more 
proactive approach could help prevent future outbreaks.
