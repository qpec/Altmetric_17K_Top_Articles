Abstract
Background
Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) has a wide
range of clinical applications but does not directly bond to
bone. Bulk incorporation of osteoconductive materials
including hydroxyapatite (HA) into the PEEK matrix is a
potential solution to address the formation of a fibrous
tissue layer between PEEK and bone and has not been
tested.
Questions/purposes
Using in vivo ovine animal models,
we asked: (1) Does PEEK-HA improve cortical and can-
cellous bone ongrowth compared with PEEK? (2) Does
PEEK-HA improve bone ongrowth and fusion outcome in
a more challenging functional ovine cervical fusion model?
Methods
The in vivo responses of PEEK-HA Enhanced
and PEEK-OPTIMA1 Natural were evaluated for bone
ongrowth in the form of dowels implanted in the cancellous
and cortical bone of adult sheep and examined at 4 and 12
weeks as well as interbody cervical fusion at 6, 12, and 26
weeks. The bone-implant interface was evaluated with
radiographic and histologic endpoints for a qualitative
assessment of direct bone contact of an intervening fibrous
tissue later. Gamma-irradiated cortical allograft cages were
evaluated as well.
Results
Incorporating HA into the PEEK matrix resulted
in more direct bone apposition as opposed to the fibrous
tissue interface with PEEK alone in the bone ongrowth as
well as interbody cervical fusions. No adverse reactions
were found at the implant–bone interface for either mate-
rial. Radiography and histology revealed resorption and
fracture of the allograft devices in vivo.
Conclusions
Incorporating HA into PEEK provides a
more favorable environment than PEEK alone for bone
ongrowth. Cervical fusion was improved with PEEK-HA
compared with PEEK alone as well as allograft bone
interbody devices.
Clinical Relevance
Improving the bone–implant interface
with a PEEK device by incorporating HA may improve
interbody fusion results and requires further clinical
studies.
Introduction
Interbody spinal fusion has a long history from the
pioneering works of Cloward [10] and Babgy [1]. The
biomechanical benefits of interbody fusion and spinal
instrumentation in the treatment of disorders of the spine
are firmly established [11]. The evolution of interbody
devices has dramatically changed from a design standpoint
as well as the materials they are made from as is evident in
the literature [7, 22].
Polyetheretherketone
(PEEK)
is
a
biocompatible
semicrystalline thermoplastic polymer that has a wide
range of clinical applications [29]. PEEK has been used in

 spinal fusion surgeries, predominantly in the form of load-
bearing interbody cages, for nearly 15 years [16]. Clinical
studies continue to support that PEEK performs as well as,
or better than, equivalent interbody fusion devices made of
metals or allograft while providing some distinct clinical
and manufacturing advantages [6, 8, 17]. These advantages
include mechanical strength, a modulus similar to cortical
bone, imaging compatibility, biocompatibility, and ease of
manufacture.
Clinically,
interbody
cages
allow
graft
material to be contained within the device and participate
in the fusion, be it autograft, allograft, or synthetic bone
graft substitutes [18]. Nevertheless, bone does not directly
bond to PEEK [20–22], which is a reflection of the
chemical inertness and hydrophobic nature of the material
[19]. In vivo, a nonreactive, discontinuous fibrous tissue
interface can form that has been well reported in preclinical
models [28, 30] and clinically observed based on imaging
modalities [21]. High fusion rates and low subsidence rates,
however, are consistently reported for PEEK-based devices
[7].
Bulk
incorporation
of
osteoconductive
materials
including hydroxyapatite (HA) into the PEEK matrix is one
potential solution to address the fibrous tissue layer present
between PEEK and bone [21]. Materials science research
into the combination of PEEK and HA has evaluated
processing as well as bioactivity of this composite material
[12, 27, 31].
We hypothesized that the incorporation of HA into the
PEEK matrix would enhance in vivo response at the bone–
implant interface. Using in vivo ovine animal models, we
asked: (1) Does PEEK-HA improve cortical and cancellous
bone ongrowth compared with PEEK? (2) Does PEEK-HA
improve bone ongrowth and fusion outcome in a more
challenging functional ovine cervical fusion model? The
null hypothesis was that there were no differences between
the different materials at the bone–implant interface.
Materials and Methods
Local institutional animal ethical approval was obtained
before the start of this work. The local histologic reaction
at the bone–implant interface was evaluated in a well-re-
ported and standardized bone–implant interface model in
both cortical and cancellous bone in sheep [2–5, 24–26, 28]
in the
form
of cylindrical
dowels. Unfilled PEEK-
OPTIMA1 Natural (PEEK; Invibio Limited, Hillhouse
International, Thornton-Cleveleys, Thornton, Cleveleys,
UK) served as the predicate material, whereas PEEK-
OPTIMA1 HA Enhanced (PEEK-HA) was the test mate-
rial. The HA in the PEEK-OPTIMA1 HA Enhanced has
been fully dispersed in the PEEK matrix with mechanical
properties
similar
to
the
standard
unfilled
PEEK-
OPTIMA1 Natural.
Dowels (6 mm diameter 9 25 mm long) were prepared
from bar stock of PEEK and PEEK-HA and autoclaved
before surgery. Three bicortical defects (6 mm diameter)
were created with a three-fluted pyramidal tip 4.5-mm drill
(Surgibit; Orthopedic Innovations, Collaroy, Australia)
overdrilled with a 6-mm drill. Dowels were implanted in
the cortical bone of the tibia in a line-to-line fashion with a
spacing of 20 mm. Cancellous implants were inserted in a
press-fit manner after the creation of 5.5-mm defects in the
cancellous bone of the proximal tibia and distal femur. The
sample size in the cortical sites was n = 5 for both groups,
whereas the sample size in the cancellous bone was n = 4
for PEEK and n = 3 for PEEK-HA at 4 and 12 weeks. One
dowel of each group was examined before surgery using a
stereo-zoom microscope and an environmental scanning
electron microscope to assess the surface when HA was
incorporated into PEEK.
The surgical sites were inspected for any signs of
adverse reactions to the implants in terms of infection,
inflammation, or swelling. The femur and tibias were
radiographed in the craniocaudal and lateral planes using a
Faxitron machine (Faxitron X-ray Corporation, Tucson,
AZ, USA) and digital plates. The DICOM data were
examined using an ezDICOM medical viewer (www.
mricro.com) to evaluate the implant-bone interface from a
radiographic perspective for evidence of adverse events at
the implant-bone interface in terms of bony resorption.
The cortical and cancellous samples were processed for
hard tissue histology by fixation in 10% phosphate-buf-
fered
formalin,
ethanol
dehydration
(70%–100%),
infiltration with methylmethacrylate (MMA), and poly-
merization in polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). PMMA-
embedded cortical implant dowels were sectioned along
the long axis of the implants using a Leica SP 1600
Microtome (Leica, Melbourne, Australia). The medial and
lateral cortical specimens were sectioned in the middle of
the implant. Two sections were cut from each PMMA
block
(approximately
15–20
lm)
and
stained
with
methylene blue and basic fuchsin. PMMA-embedded
cancellous implant dowels were sectioned perpendicular
to the long axis of the implant (approximately 15–20 lm)
and were cut and stained at 5-mm increments for the
cancellous implantations. The bone–implant interfaces on
the superior and inferior aspects of the implant were
examined using 9 2 objective using an Olympus micro-
scope and a DP72 video camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan)
to obtain a digital image of the entire interface to evaluate
bone or fibrous tissue ongrowth. The implant-bone inter-
face was examined at higher magnification for general
tissue response, and the presence of inflammatory cells as
outlined in ISO 10993-6 Biological evaluation of medical

 devices–Part 6: Test of local effects after implantation
[23]. The histologic evaluation considered cell type,
neovascularization, and fibrous tissue response with a
qualitative scale from 0 to 4 [23].
Cervical Interbody Fusion Study
The in vivo response at the bone-implant interface was
further evaluated in a functional interbody cervical fusion
model in adult sheep [13–15, 30] using local autograft as
the graft material to fill the interbody cages. PEEK and
gamma-irradiated ovine allograft cages served as the
predicate cage device, whereas cages made from PEEK-
HA were the test devices.
Cervical interbody fusion devices of identical design were
machinedfromPEEK,PEEK-HA,orovineallograftbone.The
cage dimensions were 7 9 11 9 14 mm based on anatomic
dimensions of the adult ovine cervical spine obtained from CT
scans at the study site of adult sheep. The allograft cages were
machined fromthe metatarsus of 2-year-old ovine donors from
other studies. The allograft cages were sonicated in 70%
ethanol for 30 minutes before air-drying in a laminar flow
cabinet. Samples were gamma radiation-sterilized at 25 kGy
on dry ice and then stored frozen at �20�C until implantation.
All allograft cages were inspected before implantation using
Faxitron radiographs and visual inspection to verify they were
free from defects at the time of implantation.
The cervical fusion model incorporated 18 fully mature
female sheep (4–5 years old) that were randomly assigned
to three groups to undergo cervical fusion at two nonad-
jacent spinal levels (C2–C3 and C4–C5). Preoperative
preparation began with fentanyl patches (100 mg at 2 lg/
kg/hr transdermally) applied to the sheep 24 hours before
surgery for analgesia [9].
With the animal placed in dorsal recumbency, a single
ventral midline skin incision was made from the level of
the larynx to the manubrium of the sternum. The C2–3 and
C4–5 levels were identified through manual of the atlas
(C1) after surgical exposure. The ventral aspect of the
annulus fibrosis was excised with a No. 10 scalpel blade
and the nucleus pulposus was removed with a curette to the
level of the endplate. The endplates were prepared with a
series of rasps to remove the disc material with preserva-
tion of subchondral bone. The interbody cages were filled
with local bone harvested from the ventral aspects of the
vertebral bodies with a rongeur. A 28-mm four-hole tita-
nium alloy cervical plate with four screws was positioned
ventrally to span the treated level. All interbody devices
were successfully implanted with no evidence of fracture
or damage. The fascia and skin were reapproximated and
closed using 2-0 Vicryl suture. The animals were returned
to their pens and allowed unrestricted movement after
surgery. All animals recovered well after surgery with no
adverse events. Animals were euthanized at 6, 12, and 26
weeks as per the study design for radiographic and histo-
logic endpoints.
The cervical spine from C1 to C6 was harvested at the
designated time points. High-definition radiographs were
using a Faxitron machine (Faxitron X-ray Corporation) and
digital plates. The DICOM data from the Faxitron radio-
graphs were examined using ezDICOM medical viewer to
evaluate the implant-bone interfaces from a radiographic
perspective for evidence of adverse events in terms of bony
resorption. Micro-CT was performed using an Inveon
Scanner (Siemens, Malvern, PA, USA). Slice thickness
was set to approximately 50 lm. Fusions were graded
based on the amount and quality of the bone within the
interbody devices as well as the contact with the device
itself in the sagittal and coronal planes in a blinded fashion
(WRW, CT, CC) based on a semiquantitative scale
(Table 1).
The fusions were fixed in phosphate-buffered formalin,
dehydrated through increasing concentrations of ethanol
(70%–100%), infiltrated with MMA, and polymerized in
PMMA. Three sections were taken in the sagittal plane
with a Leica SP 1600 microtome. Samples were stained
using methylene blue (Sigma-Aldrich, Castle Hill, NSW
Australia; 1% in borax buffer [0.1 M], pH 8.5) for 1 minute
followed by basic fuchsin (Sigma-Aldrich; 0.3% in water).
The histology was examined blinded (WRW, PC) to
treatment and time for device integrity, endplate interac-
tions, new bone and quality within the interbody device,
and local cellular reactions at the bone–implant interface
following the guidelines for histology grading scale as

Results
Adult Ovine Unloaded Bone–Implant Interface
PEEK-HA implants had similar surfaces compared with
PEEK although they appeared slightly grayer as a result of
the incorporation of the HA, which was present at the
surface (Fig. 1).
Faxitron radiographs did not reveal any adverse bony
reactions in terms of resorption to either group at 4 or 12
weeks in the cortical or cancellous sites. PMMA histology
revealed the typical fibrous tissue interface and the lack of
any inflammatory cell types with PEEK or PEEK-HA at 4
and 12 weeks in cortical and cancellous sites (Figs. 2, 3).
Areas of direct bone to implant contact were noted with the
PEEK-HA dowels at 4 and 12 weeks in cortical and can-
cellous sites (Figs. 2, 3).
Cervical Interbody Fusion Study in Sheep
Faxitron radiographs did not reveal any adverse bony
reactions, whereas resorption and remodeling of the allo-
graft spacers were noted. The PEEK and PEEK-HA
devices remained intact throughout the implantation peri-
ods. Micro-CT demonstrated fracture and resorption of the
allograft interbody devices that were not detected in the
Faxitron radiographs. Resorption of the allograft interbody
spacers was noted at all time points. Fracture of the allo-
graft interbody spacers was noted in three of five at 6
weeks; two of four at 12 weeks; and one of four at 26
weeks for a total six of the 13 sites (46%) during the in vivo
implantation period. Micro-CT analysis demonstrated that
new bone formation was greater with the PEEK-HA
devices compared with PEEK at 6 weeks (Table 2). The
quality of new bone bridging between the vertebral bodies
and contributing toward fusion was more mature in the
PEEK-HA group compared with PEEK at all time points
(Fig. 4). A qualitative examination of the lCT images
supported greater direct bone contact with the PEEK-HA
devices compared with PEEK, and this was more evident at
Fig. 1A–B Macroscopically, PEEK-HA (B) appears slightly gray
compared with PEEK (A). Backscattering scanning electron micro-

 6 and 12 weeks while the fusion was still maturing and
remodeling.
Histology confirmed the biocompatibility of PEEK as
well as PEEK-HA with no evidence of inflammatory cell
types at the interface at 6, 12, and 26 weeks (Fig. 5). This
was supported by the ISO 10993-6 evaluation (data not
shown).
The graft inside the PEEK-HA devices qualitatively
appeared more robust at 6 and 12 weeks compared with
the graft inside the PEEK devices. These differences
were less evident at 26 weeks but remained suggestive of
a more mature graft in the PEEK-HA devices compared
with PEEK. In contrast, there was substantial resorption
of the allograft implants and fracture of the devices as
noted in the lCT results. Allograft devices showed a
high degree of new bone formation and incorporation
into the surrounding bone. This was countered, however,
by the high degree of resorption combined with device
fracture.
Discussion
Controlling the surface interactions at the bone-implant
interface has the potential to influence the in vivo responses
to a device. Modifying properties of a material either through
surface coatings or topography can increase bone ingrowth
or ongrowth to orthopaedic biomaterials [2–5, 24–26, 28].
Direct bone ongrowth to PEEK-HA could provide a better
interface than the nonreactive fibrous layer reported for
PEEK alone in bone [28]. We hypothesized that the incor-
poration of HA into the PEEK matrix would enhance the
in vivo response at the bone–implant interface. Using in vivo
sheep models, we asked: (1) Does PEEK-HA improve cor-
tical and cancellous bone ongrowth compared with PEEK
alone? (2) Does PEEK-HA improve bone ongrowth and
fusion outcome in a more challenging cervical fusion model?
The current studies demonstrate incorporating HA into
PEEK provides a more favorable environment than PEEK
alone for bone ongrowth and spinal fusion.
Fig. 2A–D Bone ongrowth in cortical sites for PEEK at 4 and 12
weeks (A, C) and PEEK-HA (B, D) demonstrated the presence of
fibrous tissue interface for PEEK (*), whereas a direct bone-to-
implant interface was observed for PEEK-HA at the magnification
used. Magnification bar = 200 lm.

 Although the two models used in the current study
represent increasing complexity of surgery, loading, and
kinematics, they remain limited for direct comparisons
with human pathology. The long bone ongrowth model
[2–5, 24–26, 28] is limited because the implants are con-
tained in a closed defect and are not under direct load. The
cervical fusion model is more demanding with implants
under load and motion between the vertebral bodies and the
device endplates. The small sample size and lack of fol-
lowup
beyond
26
weeks
are
also
limiting
factors.
Nevertheless, preclinical animal models allow for exami-
nation of devices and interfaces using lCT and histology
beyond the scope of human studies.
Our results demonstrate incorporating HA into PEEK
qualitatively enhanced bone ongrowth in cortical and
cancellous sites, whereas PEEK alone presented the
Fig. 3A–D Bone ongrowth in cancellous sites for PEEK at 12 weeks
(A, C) and PEEK-HA (B, D) demonstrated the presence of fibrous
tissue interface for PEEK (*), whereas a direct bone-to-implant
interface was observed for PEEK-HA at the magnification used.
Magnification bars = 1 mm for A and C and 200 lm for B and D.

 nonreactive fibrous tissue interface as reported previously
[16, 20, 28]. The fusions across all groups improved with
time demonstrating an increase in new bone formation
within the interbody devices. The allograft interbody
device showed the most variability in new bone formation,
device fracture, and fusion quality. The allograft cage was
the most ‘‘biologically’’ active with new bone formation
directly on the surfaces of the implant. Although the benefit
of the HA incorporation into the PEEK was not differen-
tiated at the clinical or radiographic levels, micro-CT and
histology showed direct bone contact rather than a nonre-
active fibrous tissue layer at the implant interface. The

HA at the surface of PEEK provides an osteoconductive
surface, which supports bone apposition. This material is
being used clinically and future reports in humans will
provide a bridge between the preclinical and clinical
results. The application of new materials to improve clin-
ical outcome and participate actively with the biologic
process involved in healing represents an exciting area of
new research. This coupled with increased understanding
of the ideal geometry for interbody devices will continue to
push this field forward.
