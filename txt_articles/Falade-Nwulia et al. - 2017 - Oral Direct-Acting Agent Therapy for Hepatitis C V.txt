Background: Rapid improvements in hepatitis C virus (HCV)
therapy have led to the approval of multiple oral direct-acting
antiviral (DAA) regimens by the U.S. Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) for treatment of chronic HCV infection.
Purpose: To summarize published literature on the efficacy and
safety of oral DAAs for treatment of persons with chronic HCV
infection.
Data Sources: MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception through
1 November 2016.
Study Selection: 42 English-language studies from controlled
and
single-group
registered
clinical
trials
of
adults
with
HCV infection that evaluated at least 8 weeks of an FDA-
approved interferon-free HCV regimen that included at least 2
DAAs.
Data Extraction: Two investigators abstracted data on study
design, patient characteristics, and virologic and safety out-
comes sequentially and assessed quality independently.
Data Synthesis: Six DAA regimens showed high sustained viro-
logic response (SVR) rates (>95%) in patients with HCV genotype
1 infection without cirrhosis, including those with HIV co-
infection. Effective treatments for HCV genotype 3 infection are
limited (2 DAA regimens). Patients with hepatic decompensa-
tion, particularly those with Child–Turcotte–Pugh class C disease,
had lower SVR rates (78% to 87%) than other populations. The
addition of ribavirin was associated with increased SVR rates for
certain DAA regimens and patient groups. Overall rates of seri-
ous adverse events and treatment discontinuation were low
(<10% in the general population); regimens that included ribavi-
rin had more mild or moderate adverse events than those
without.
Limitations:
Twenty-three
studies
had
moderate
risk
of
bias (10 were open-label single-group trials, 11 had limited in-
formation on concealment of the allocation scheme, and 5 had
selective outcome reporting). All but 1 of the studies were
industry-funded.
Heterogeneity
of
interventions
precluded
pooling.
Conclusion: Multiple oral DAA regimens show high rates of
safety, tolerability, and efficacy for treatment of HCV genotype 1
infection, particularly among persons without cirrhosis.

I
n the United States, 3.2 to 5 million people are chron-
ically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and are at
risk for cirrhosis, liver cancer, and death if untreated (1,
2). Infection with HCV is the primary indication for liver
transplantation and causes more deaths than all other
notifiable infectious diseases in the United States com-
bined (3, 4). Cure of this infection, defined as the ab-
sence of detectable HCV RNA in the blood at least 12
weeks after treatment completion (sustained virologic
response [SVR]), is strongly associated with reduced
liver-related morbidity and mortality (5, 6). The devel-
opment of drugs that directly inhibit key steps in viral
replication has led to availability of several oral HCV
treatment regimens (7). We systematically reviewed the
efficacy and safety of oral interferon-free HCV treat-
ment regimens that have been approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and include at
least 2 direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). We also assessed
the effect of ribavirin on rates of SVR and adverse
events. We reviewed phase 2 and 3 clinical trial data for
patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 to 6 and pa-
tients previously considered difficult to cure with de-
compensated cirrhosis, HIV infection, renal failure, or
liver transplantation.
METHODS
Data Sources and Searches
We developed a protocol for this systematic review
and registered it in PROSPERO (CRD42014009711).
We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for literature pub-
lished in English from inception through 1 November
2016. The search strategy included terms for HCV
infection and the medications of interest (Figure 1). We
also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and hand-searched the
reference lists of included articles and related system-
atic reviews.
Study Selection
We included English-language, single-group, ran-
domized controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with chronic

 HCV infection that evaluated at least 8 weeks of an
FDA-approved interferon-free HCV regimen that in-
cluded at least 2 DAAs. We included trials that used
DAA combinations—including inhibitors of HCV NS3
protease (grazoprevir, paritaprevir, and simeprevir),
NS5A (daclatasvir, elbasvir, ledipasvir, ombitasvir, and
velpatasvir), and NS5B polymerase (sofosbuvir and das-
abuvir), as well as the oral antiviral ribavirin—and for
which the primary outcome was SVR. We excluded
studies published only as abstracts; dose-finding stud-
ies; those in which the primary outcome was pharma-
cokinetics; or those in which the regimens included in-
terferon, DAAs that were not FDA-approved, or only 1
DAA (for example, sofosbuvir plus ribavirin). Trials were
included regardless of participants' cirrhosis, HIV, or
liver transplantation status, but trials of limited popula-
tions (for example, DAA-experienced patients or those
of a single race) were excluded.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Two reviewers independently screened titles and
abstracts and then the full text of potentially eligible
articles to identify studies meeting inclusion criteria. Us-
ing standardized forms, 1 reviewer extracted informa-
tion from the selected studies about study characteris-
tics, design, outcomes, and the funding source. A
second reviewer confirmed the accuracy of the extrac-
tions. Differences were resolved through consensus.
Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias for
each selected study by using 5 items from the Co-
chrane risk-of-bias tools for RCTs and a Cochrane tool
for assessment of risk of bias in nonrandomized trials
and observational studies (8, 9).
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Detailed evidence tables were generated, and
studies were summarized by outcomes. The results
were organized by genotype and then by the specific
population studied. The heterogeneity of the interven-
tions precluded quantitative pooling of results.
Role of the Funding Source
The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute
(PCORI) funded the study and reviewed the report but
did not participate in the formulation of the review'
s
questions, data searches, study appraisals, evidence in-
terpretation, or the preparation or approval of the man-
uscript for publication.
RESULTS
Study and Quality Characteristics
Of 1796 citations evaluated, we included 42 stud-
ies published in 40 articles (Figure 1). All but 1 of the
studies were funded by industry (10). Ten were open-
label, single-group studies (10–19); 5 had a placebo
group with deferred treatment (20–24); 11 evaluated
different durations of therapies and the addition of
ribavirin (for example, 8 vs. 12 weeks or 12 vs. 24 weeks
of therapy with or without ribavirin) (25–35); 5 evalu-
ated the same duration of therapy with and without
ribavirin (36–39); 6 evaluated different durations with
ribavirin (40–45); and 3 evaluated different durations of
therapy without ribavirin (46–48). Only 2 studies had an
active comparator group receiving an HCV treatment
regimen other than that being evaluated in the trial
(49). Three studies had 48 weeks of posttreatment
follow-up, whereas the remainder had 12 or 24 weeks
of follow-up.
Of the 42 studies, 19 had low risk of bias and 23
had moderate risk. Sources of possible bias included
single-group design (n = 10), lack of information on se-
quence generation or concealment of the allocation
scheme (n = 11), and selective reporting of outcomes
(n = 5). Because SVR is a highly objective outcome
measure, lack of blinding was not considered an impor-
tant threat to validity. Rates of loss to follow-up were
low (<10% for all studies).

 HCV Genotype 1 Infection
Thirty-two studies enrolled persons with HCV ge-
notype 1 infection (Table; Figure 2; and Table 1 of the
Supplement, available at Annals.org).
Regimens That Include NS3/4A Protease Inhibitors
Grazoprevir–Elbasvir.
Grazoprevir is an NS3 pro-
tease inhibitor that is available in a fixed-dose combi-
nation with elbasvir, an NS5A inhibitor. This regimen
was studied in 4 multicenter randomized trials pub-
lished in 6 articles (11, 20, 21, 25–27). Risk of bias was
moderate in 3 of these studies due to lack of a compar-
ator group (n = 1) and selective reporting (n = 2). Daily
grazoprevir–elbasvir for 12 weeks was associated with
SVR rates of 92% and 99% to 100% in treatment-naive
and treatment-experienced patients with genotype 1a
and 1b infection, respectively (20, 26, 27). Among pa-
tients with genotype 1a but not genotype 1b infection,
lower SVR rates were associated with pretreatment
presence of naturally occurring resistance-associated
substitutions (RASs) at positions 28, 30, 31, and 93 of
the NS5A region (20, 27). Prolongation of therapy to 16
weeks and addition of ribavirin led to SVR among 49
treatment-experienced patients, including all 6 patients
with baseline NS5A RASs (27). Ribavirin was associated
with greater incidence of anemia (3% to 16% vs. 0%),
fatigue, and nausea (25–27). With the exception of pa-
tients with genotype 1a infection with baseline RASs,
the SVR rate was similar in those treated with or without
ribavirin. Cirrhosis was not associated with lower SVR
rates (14, 16).
Paritaprevir–Ritonavir–Ombitasvir and Dasabuvir.
Paritaprevir is an NS3 protease inhibitor that is cofor-
mulated
with
ritonavir
(to
provide
pharmacologic
boosting) and ombitasvir (an NS5A inhibitor). For pa-
tients with genotype 1 infection, dasabuvir (a non-
nucleoside NS5B polymerase inhibitor) was added. We
identified 1 study with low risk of bias that used the
two-DAA regimen without dasabuvir (45) and 9 studies
(5 with low risk of bias and 4 with moderate risk of bias)
that used the three-DAA regimen for 12 or 24 weeks
(12, 13, 22, 23, 37, 38, 40, 41). Moderate risk of bias
was due to lack of a comparator group (n = 2) and un-
clear sequence generation and allocation scheme con-
cealment (n = 2). The three-DAA regimen without riba-
virin yielded lower SVR rates in persons with genotype
1a infection (90%) than those with genotype 1b infec-
tion (99%); however, with the addition of ribavirin, the
SVR rate among noncirrhotic patients with genotype 1a
infection increased to 97% (38). Compared with pla-
cebo, ribavirin was associated with more anemia, fa-
tigue, insomnia, and rash (22, 38). Among cirrhotic

 patients with genotype 1a infection, the three-DAA reg-
imen plus ribavirin for 24 weeks led to higher SVR rates
than 12 weeks of treatment (94.2% vs. 88.6%) (41). High
rates of SVR were seen among cirrhotic and noncir-
rhotic patients with genotype 1b infection treated for
12 weeks with the three-DAA regimen alone or with
ribavirin (97% to 100%) (22, 23, 37, 38, 41, 45).
Simeprevir and Sofosbuvir.
Simeprevir is an NS3
protease inhibitor that is used once daily in combina-
tion with sofosbuvir, a nucleoside analogue NS5B poly-
merase inhibitor. We identified 3 studies using this reg-
imen (14, 28, 46). Risk of bias was moderate in 2 studies
due to unclear sequence generation (n = 1) and lack of
a comparator group (n = 1). When used for 12 weeks,
the regimen was associated with high rates of SVR
(97%) in persons with HCV genotype 1a or 1b infection
without cirrhosis (46). In this population, pretreatment
presence of naturally occurring simeprevir RASs at po-
sition 80 of the NS3 region (Q80K) was not associated
with lower SVR rates (46). However, lower SVR rates
were observed among patients with cirrhosis (79% to
88%) and, in this population, the presence of the Q80K
RAS was associated with lower SVR rates in patients
with genotype 1a infection (74% with Q80K and 92%
without) (14).
Regimens That Do Not Include NS3/4A Protease
Inhibitors
Daclatasvir and Sofosbuvir. Daclatasvir is an NS5A
inhibitor used with sofosbuvir. Clinical trial data on this
combination are limited but suggest high SVR rates
with 12- and 24-week treatment (96% to 100%), based
on data from 2 studies with moderate risk of bias (29,
48). Among patients with advanced liver disease, SVR
rates were lower (82%) (15).
Ledipasvir–Sofosbuvir. Ledipasvir, an NS5A inhibi-
tor, is coformulated with sofosbuvir as a once-daily tab-
let. Eight studies (4 with low risk of bias and 4 with
moderate risk of bias) evaluated different treatment du-
rations (8, 12, and 24 weeks) and the addition of riba-
virin (17, 30–34, 43, 44). Moderate risk of bias was due
to lack of a comparator (n = 1) and unclear sequence

 In treatment-naive patients, SVR rates were greater than
95% with 12 weeks of treatment, and longer treatment
did not yield higher rates (30, 31, 33). Although 8
weeks of therapy was assessed in 1 RCT and was found
to lead to high SVR rates in noncirrhotic persons with
pretreatment HCV RNA levels less than 6 × 106 IU/mL
(33), the most data on efficacy are for 12 weeks. In
treatment-naive patients, ribavirin was not associated
with higher SVR rates regardless of cirrhosis status,
whereas in treatment-experienced patients, either lon-
ger therapy (24 weeks) with ledipasvir–sofosbuvir or the
addition of ribavirin to the regimen for 12 weeks was
associated with higher SVR rates in patients with cirrho-
sis (97% vs. 96%) (34). The addition of ribavirin led to
more adverse events, notably anemia, fatigue, and in-
somnia (31–33).
Velpatasvir–Sofosbuvir.
Velpatasvir, a pangeno-
typic NS5A inhibitor, is coformulated with sofosbuvir as
a once-daily tablet. This regimen for 12 weeks was as-
sociated with high SVR rates (97% to 99%) in patients
with HCV genotype 1a or 1b infection, including those
with cirrhosis and prior treatment experience (24). In
this placebo-controlled, double-blind trial with low risk
of bias, the incidence of adverse events was similar in
patients receiving velpatasvir–sofosbuvir and those re-
ceiving placebo.
HCV Genotype 2 Infection
Six studies enrolled patients with HCV genotype 2
infection (Table and Figure 3); 3 studies (2 with low risk
of bias and 1 with moderate risk of bias) evaluated the
fixed-dose combination of velpatasvir–sofosbuvir (24,
35, 49), and 3 with moderate risk of bias evaluated da-
clatasvir plus sofosbuvir (15, 29, 48).
Daclatasvir and Sofosbuvir
In the ALLY-2 study, all 13 HIV-infected patients
with genotype 2 infection who were treated for 12
weeks achieved SVR (48). In another study, 24 of 26
(92%) treatment-naive, noncirrhotic, HIV-seronegative
patients treated for 24 weeks with or without ribavirin
achieved SVR; 2 patients were lost to follow-up (29).
Velpatasvir–Sofosbuvir
The ASTRAL-1 and ASTRAL-2 studies reported SVR
in 237 of 238 patients (99%) with genotype 2 infection
who received velpatasvir–sofosbuvir for 12 weeks; 1 pa-
tient was lost to follow-up (24, 49). Rates of SVR were
not affected by cirrhosis or prior treatment experience.
In an RCT, velpatasvir–sofosbuvir was superior to sofos-
buvir plus ribavirin (SVR of 99% vs. 94%) and was asso-
ciated with fewer adverse events (49).
HCV Genotype 3 Infection
Eight studies enrolled patients with HCV genotype
3 infection (Table and Figure 3).
Daclatasvir and Sofosbuvir
In a phase 2 study, 16 of 18 noncirrhotic patients
treated with or without ribavirin for 24 weeks achieved
SVR (29). In the single-group ALLY-3 trial, which had
moderate risk of bias, 94% to 97% of noncirrhotic
treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients
achieved SVR with 12 weeks of treatment (16). In the
same study, cirrhosis was associated with a marked re-
duction in SVR (58% to 69%) (16). The addition of riba-
virin to the regimen for 12 or 16 weeks in patients with
advanced liver disease led to SVR in 86% of cirrhotic
patients (n = 36) in the ALLY-3+ study, which had mod-
erate risk of bias due to unclear sequence generation
and allocation scheme (42).
Ledipasvir–Sofosbuvir
In a single-center study with low risk of bias, all
26 treatment-naive patients treated with ledipasvir–
sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 12 weeks achieved SVR
(39). The SVR rate was lower without ribavirin (64%) and
in treatment-experienced patients (82%) (39).
Velpatasvir–Sofosbuvir
In a phase 3 RCT with 552 patients and low risk of
bias, velpatasvir–sofosbuvir for 12 weeks (95%) was su-
perior to sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 24 weeks (80%)
and was associated with fewer adverse events, particu-
larly less anemia (49). Lower SVR rates were observed
in patients with pretreatment presence of velpatasvir
NS5A RASs, particularly at position 93 (88%), compared
with those without RASs (97%).
HCV Genotype 4 Infection
Twelve studies enrolled persons with HCV geno-
type 4 infection (Table and Figure 3).
Grazoprevir–Elbasvir
In the C-EDGE study, efficacy of grazoprevir–
elbasvir was demonstrated among 18 of 18 treatment-
naive patients with genotype 4 infection (SVR of 100%)
who received the regimen for 12 weeks; baseline pres-
ence of NS5A RASs did not affect SVR (20). Among
treatment-experienced patients in a randomized trial of
12 or 16 weeks of the regimen with or without ribavirin,
SVR rates were below 95% in all groups except patients
who received 16 weeks of the regimen with ribavirin
(27).
Paritaprevir–Ritonavir–Ombitasvir
In

with

risk

bias,
paritaprevir–
ritonavir–ombitasvir plus ribavirin resulted in high effi-
cacy (SVR of 100%) in both treatment-naive (n = 42) and
treatment-experienced (n = 44) patients with genotype
4 infection (36). The absence of ribavirin was associated
with a lower SVR rate (91%).
Simeprevir and Sofosbuvir
In an RCT with moderate risk of bias due to unclear
sequence generation and allocation scheme conceal-
ment, simeprevir plus sofosbuvir was associated with
SVR in all 43 patients (100%) treated for 12 weeks, in-
cluding those with cirrhosis (n = 23); however, SVR

 rates were lower in 20 patients treated for 8 weeks
(75%) (47).
Ledipasvir–Sofosbuvir
In a single-group trial of 21 patients, 95% who re-
ceived 12 weeks of ledipasvir–sofosbuvir achieved SVR;
the study included few patients with cirrhosis (n = 7) or
prior treatment experience (n = 8) (10). In a similar trial
conducted in France, 41 of 44 patients (93%) who were
treated for 12 weeks achieved SVR (19). No serious ad-
verse events were reported in these studies (10, 19).
Velpatasvir–Sofosbuvir
In the ASTRAL-1 RCT, which had low risk of bias,
velpatasvir–sofosbuvir led to SVR in all 116 treatment-
naive and treatment-experienced patients (100%) who
were treated, including those with cirrhosis (24).
HCV Genotype 5 and 6 Infection
Six studies enrolled persons with HCV genotype 5
and/or 6 infection (18, 20, 24, 27, 35, 39) (Figure 3).
Ledipasvir–Sofosbuvir
This combination led to high SVR rates in persons
with genotype 5 (n = 41; SVR of 95%) and genotype 6
(n = 25; SVR of 96%) infection (18, 39). Although the
numbers of patients in these subgroups were small,
SVR rates were high in treatment-experienced patients
(≥95%) and those with cirrhosis (89%) (18).
Velpatasvir–Sofosbuvir
In 1 RCT with low risk of bias, patients with geno-
type 5 (n = 35) and genotype 6 (n = 41) infection
achieved high rates of SVR (97% and 100%, respec-
tively) with 12 weeks of treatment; only 1 patient did
not achieve SVR (death unrelated to treatment) (24).
Subpopulations
Patients With HIV Co-infection
Direct-acting antiviral regimens used for 12 or 24
weeks showed high SVR rates (91% to 98%) and low
adverse event rates (<10%). These rates were similar to
those observed in persons without HIV (11, 17, 26, 40,
48). Shorter therapy (8 weeks) was evaluated in 1 RCT
of daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir and led to lower rates of
SVR (76%) than 12 weeks of therapy (97%) (48).
Patients With Decompensated Cirrhosis
Relatively few patients with decompensated liver
disease (for example, those with jaundice, ascites, en-
cephalopathy, or variceal hemorrhage) have been
enrolled in DAA trials. Because of impaired metabo-
lism, NS3 protease inhibitors are not recommended
(simeprevir) or are contraindicated (paritaprevir or gra-
zoprevir) in patients with Child–Turcotte–Pugh class B
and C disease. These patients have been treated in tri-
als of sofosbuvir plus NS5A inhibitors, including dacla-
tasvir, ledipasvir, and velpatasvir (15, 35, 43, 44). In 1
RCT, velpatasvir–sofosbuvir with ribavirin for 12 weeks
was more effective than velpatasvir–sofosbuvir alone
for 12 or 24 weeks; however, ribavirin was associated
with more treatment discontinuation due to adverse
events (35). Across all studies, rates of serious adverse
events were higher in patients with decompensated cir-
rhosis (10% to 52%) than in the general HCV patient
populations (<10%).
Patients After Liver Transplantation
Four trials evaluated DAAs in patients who had un-
dergone liver transplantation. Overall, SVR rates ob-
served in these trials were similar to those reported in
patients without a transplant (12, 15, 43, 44). However,
among liver transplant patients with decompensated
liver disease due to recurrent HCV infection, SVR rates
were lower (50% to 80%) and adverse event rates were
higher (16% to 75%) than those observed in liver trans-
plant patients with compensated cirrhosis or those with
minimal liver disease (6% to 21%) (12, 43, 44).
Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease
In 2 studies of patients with advanced renal dys-
function, including those receiving hemodialysis, high
SVR rates were reported in those with HCV genotype
1 infection (13, 21). In 1 study with low risk of bias,
grazoprevir–elbasvir for 12 weeks resulted in SVR in
94% of patients (n = 111) (21). In a smaller study with
moderate risk of bias due to lack of a comparator
group, a regimen of paritaprevir–ritonavir–ombitasvir
and dasabuvir was effective (SVR of 90%), but ribavirin,
which was used for patients with genotype 1a infection,
was poorly tolerated and was discontinued due to ad-
verse events in 8 of 14 patients (48).
DISCUSSION
Multiple interferon-free, oral DAA regimens are
available for treatment of chronic HCV infection. We
found high SVR rates for all FDA-approved DAA regi-
mens, with some evidence of variable response influ-
enced by specific patient and virus characteristics.
Rates
of
serious
adverse
events
(<10%),
loss
to
follow-up (<10%), and treatment discontinuation (<5%)
were low even in patients with comorbid conditions,
such as HIV infection and cirrhosis.
The evidence was robust for persons with geno-
type 1 infection, which is the most common genotype
worldwide, infecting approximately 84 million persons
(50). We reviewed 6 distinct DAA regimens for geno-
type 1 infection, with SVR rates greater than 95% for
most drug combinations and patient populations. Our
findings represent an important update of other sys-
tematic reviews of DAA regimens with and without in-
terferon for treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection,
which reported SVR rates in the range of 95% (50, 51)
and 92% (52). The high treatment response rates in
persons with genotype 1 infection are particularly im-
portant in light of the historically poor SVR rates ob-
served with interferon in this population.

 In contrast, fewer DAA regimens are available and
effective for the treatment of HCV genotype 3 infection,
which is the second most prevalent HCV genotype
globally, infecting approximately 54 million persons.
Our findings indicate that the most effective DAA regi-
mens for patients who have genotype 3 infection with-
out cirrhosis are sofosbuvir plus the NS5A inhibitors
velpatasvir or daclatasvir for 12 weeks, whereas higher
SVR rates were observed with velpatasvir–sofosbuvir in
patients with cirrhosis. This agrees with recent system-
atic reviews, identified through MEDLINE searches from
2014 to 2016, that identified velpatasvir–sofosbuvir as the
most effective treatment for genotype 3 infection (51,
52). Our findings also suggest that lower SVR rates
were achieved in patients with compensated and de-
compensated cirrhosis, prior treatment experience, or
NS5A RASs; the addition of ribavirin and longer treat-
ment duration were associated with higher SVR rates in
these patient groups (42, 53).
Although relatively few studies enrolled patients
with genotype 2, 4, 5, or 6 infection, high rates of SVR
(>92%) were observed for all regimens administered
for at least 12 weeks. Rates of SVR were particularly
high (99%) for patients with genotype 2, 4, 5, or 6 in-
fection treated with velpatasvir–sofosbuvir (24). For
treatment of genotype 4 infection, all but 1 of the DAA
regimens (paritaprevir–ritonavir–ombitasvir) led to high
SVR rates (93% to 100%) without ribavirin and were as-
sociated with minimal adverse effects in treatment-
naive patients.
Oral DAA regimens also showed high SVR rates
and minimal adverse events in patient populations that
were poorly responsive or could not be treated with
interferon, including those with HIV co-infection, de-
compensated cirrhosis, severe chronic kidney disease,
and a liver transplant. Patients co-infected with HIV and
HCV and those receiving immunosuppressive agents
after liver transplantation had SVR rates similar to those
of persons without immune dysfunction, suggesting
that oral DAAs mitigate the effect of an impaired HCV
immune response (54–56). Direct-acting antiviral op-
tions for persons with severe chronic kidney disease
remain limited, and although high SVR rates (85% to
100%) were observed in 2 RCTs for persons with HCV
genotype 1 infection, no trials were identified in per-
sons with genotype 2 or 3 infection, for whom inter-
feron is still recommended (57). Treatment options also
remain limited in patients with decompensated liver
disease. Current NS3 protease inhibitors are hepatically
metabolized and are contraindicated in this popula-
tion; as such, trials have been restricted to sofosbuvir
plus NS5A inhibitors. The evidence indicates that these
regimens provide high rates of SVR (>85%), but serious
adverse events are common (10% to 52%). In addition,
questions remain with regard to the long-term clinical
benefit of cure of HCV infection in persons with severe
liver dysfunction.
Across multiple trials, our findings indicate that
ribavirin continues to have a role in maximizing SVR
rates in certain patients, including those with genotype
1a or 3 infection, cirrhosis, or prior treatment experi-
ence. Clinical trials for patients with decompensated
cirrhosis and a liver transplant have also largely in-
cluded ribavirin. Although ribavirin was associated with
an increase in anemia, fatigue, and insomnia, the rates
of serious adverse events and treatment discontinua-
tion were similar in patients treated with and without
it.
Limitations of this study include the fact that safety
data from clinical trials may not fully represent patient
experience in clinical practice. Persons with chronic
hepatitis B virus infection were excluded from trials,
and the risk for hepatitis B virus reactivation was not
examined. We also included noncontrolled trials; how-
ever, spontaneous cure of HCV infection is rare. Most of
the studies were industry-funded; such studies are
more likely to be published if results are favorable (58),
but we are not aware of large, unpublished studies in
this field and the risk of bias with the objective outcome
of SVR is low. The heterogeneity of the interventions
studied also prevented quantitative pooling of results,
and the relatively short follow-up limits our ability to
comment on late relapse of HCV infection. Several
studies were also population-specific, thus limiting gen-
eralizability of findings to all patients. Given the multi-
tude of effective oral DAA regimens with similar rates of
SVR and adverse events, RCTs will be needed to deter-
mine the best HCV treatments for different patient
populations. One such trial, the PRIORITIZE study
(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02786537), is under way in per-
sons with genotype 1 infection (59).
Finally, our systematic review is limited by the
rapidly evolving HCV treatment landscape and the in-
ability to include all DAA regimens in ongoing or re-
cently completed clinical trials that we identified on
ClinicalTrials.gov (Table 7 of the Supplement). These
ongoing clinical trials include 2 novel nucleotide ana-
logue NS5B polymerase inhibitors, MK-3682 and AL-
335, which are being evaluated in combination with ap-
proved
NS3
protease
inhibitors
and
novel
NS5A
inhibitors (ruzasvir and odalasvir), as well as 2 novel
pangenotypic NS3 protease inhibitors, voxilaprevir and
glecaprevir, which are being evaluated in combination
with approved (sofosbuvir–velpatasvir–voxilaprevir) and
novel (glecaprevir–pibrentasvir) DAAs (60).
In conclusion, oral DAA regimens that are highly
efficacious, well-tolerated, and relatively short in dura-
tion are now available for all HCV genotypes and for
patient populations historically considered difficult to
cure. The ease of dosing, safety profile, and effective-
ness of these agents provide an opportunity to expand
the number of patients who can be treated for HCV
infection and the pool of treating providers. Rapid de-
velopments in oral DAA therapies can be beneficial
only if they are linked to efforts to improve rates of
HCV detection, linkage to care, and access to DAA
therapy.
