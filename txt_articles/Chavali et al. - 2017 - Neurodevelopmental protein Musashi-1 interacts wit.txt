A recent outbreak of Zika virus in Brazil has led to a simultaneous increase in reports of
neonatal microcephaly. Zika targets cerebral neural precursors, a cell population essential for
cortical development, but the cause of this neurotropism remains obscure. Here we report
that the neural RNA-binding protein Musashi-1 (MSI1) interacts with the Zika genome and
enables viral replication. Zika infection disrupts the binding of MSI1 to its endogenous
targets, thereby deregulating expression of factors implicated in neural stem cell function. We
further show that MSI1 is highly expressed in neural progenitors of the human embryonic
brain and is mutated in individuals with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly. Selective
MSI1 expression in neural precursors could therefore explain the exceptional vulnerability
of these cells to Zika infection.
Z
ika virus (ZIKV) recently emerged as a major
public health risk because of its devastating
effect on fetal neurodevelopment (1–3). ZIKV
was first isolated in Uganda in 1947, and
the virus subsequently spread through Asia,
and from there to the Americas (4). A causal link
between ZIKV infection and congenital brain
malformations became apparent in 2016 after an
outbreak in Brazil (1). Brazilian ZIKV belongs to
the Asian lineage which affected New Caledonia
and French Polynesia, where cases of microceph-
aly were reported retrospectively (5).
Intrauterine infections can impair neurodevel-
opment (6), but ZIKV is highly neurotropic and
interferes specifically with fetal brain develop-
ment, causing microcephaly, cortical malforma-
tions, and intracranial calcifications (7–10). We
hypothesized that the single-stranded RNA fla-
vivirus ZIKV may hijack RNA-binding factors
present in the developing central nervous sys-
tem (11). Host RNA-binding proteins are known
to interact with untranslated regions (UTRs) to
regulate replication, translation, and stabilization
of viral genomes (11). In silico analysis of the
genomic RNA of the Brazilian ZIKV strain, PE243,
revealed three consensus binding sites in the 3′
UTR for the highly conserved Musashi family
of RNA-binding proteins, Musashi-1 (MSI1) and
Musashi-2 (MSI2), both important translational
regulators in stem cells (12–15). Two sites were con-
served between PE243 and the Ugandan MR766
strains (sites 1 and 2), whereas the third (site 3)
was found only in the Asian-lineage strains includ-
ing PE243 (Fig. 1A and fig. S1, A and B). By mapping
these sites onto a predicted secondary structure
of ZIKV 3′UTR, we found all three sites to be pre-
sent on stem-loop structures, which are considered
optimal for MSI binding (16, 17). Moreover, a re-
cent study revealed nucleotide substitutions prox-
imal to sites 1 and 2 in the Asian-lineage strains,
which could indicate positive selection for MSI1
binding during ZIKV evolution (18).
To address if the Musashi proteins interacted
with ZIKV, we first tested their binding to ZIKV
3′UTR. RNA pull-down assays identified binding
of MSI1, but not MSI2, to the 3′UTR of PE243
(Fig. 1B) (15). Mutating the three consensus MSI1
sites in the 3′UTR of PE243 significantly weakened
this interaction (Fig. 1, C and D, and fig. S1C). We
also confirmed binding between MSI1 and the
3′UTR of MR766 (Fig. 1C). To investigate whether
MSI1 also binds ZIKV 3′UTR in vivo, ultraviolet
(UV) cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) of
RNA was performed from lysates of PE243-infected
U-251 glioblastoma cells, revealing a robust direct
interaction between MSI1 and PE243 ZIKV RNA
(Fig. 1E). Consistently, in ZIKV-infected cells, MSI1
colocalized with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a
viral replication intermediate, as visualized by con-
focal and stimulated emission depletion (STED)
super-resolution microscopy (Fig. 1, F and G).
These data confirm an interaction between MSI1
and ZIKV RNA, which is, at least in part, me-
diated by the 3′UTR of the virus.
To investigate whether MSI1 had an effect on
the life cycle of ZIKV, we used RNA interference
to deplete the protein in U-251 glioblastoma,
SK-N-BE2c neuroblastoma, and H9-derived neu-
ral stem cells (NSCs) and performed PE243 viral
infections. In all three cell types, MSI1 depletion
led to a marked reduction in viral RNA levels
(Fig. 2, A and B). We then generated MSI1
knockouts (KOs) in U-251 cells by clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–
Cas9–mediated targeting of exons 8 or 6 of MSI1
(KO1 and KO2, respectively; Fig. 2C and fig. S2).
Control cells were obtained through clonal expan-
sion of cells transfected with Cas9 alone. By
measuring viral RNA at different times after
PE243 infection, a marked reduction of viral load
was seen in KO1 and KO2 cells at 24 and 48 hours
(Fig. 2D). Whereas extensive cell death precluded
RNA analysis in the controls at 72 hours, viral RNA
was comparable between the 48- and 72-hour
time points in the KO cells. Consistently, levels
of the viral dsRNA and flavivirus E protein, as
well as the infectious titer, were reduced in the
KOs (Fig. 2E and fig. S3). Because MSI2 levels
were similar between control and KO cells
(Fig. 2C), MSI1 and MSI2 are unlikely to have
complete functional redundancy in ZIKV repli-
cation. Replication of the MR766 strain was also
impaired in the KO cells (Fig. 2F). In summary,
we identify MSI1 as an important factor for ZIKV
replication, both in primary and transformed
neural cell lines.
Because there was no discernible difference
between ZIKV binding and entry into control and
KO cells (Fig. 2, G and H), we asked if MSI1 could
regulate translation through ZIKV UTRs. To this
end, luciferase RNA flanked by the 5′ and 3′UTRs
of PE243, was transfected with increasing amounts
of MSI1 into human embryonic kidney (HEK)
293T cells, which do not normally express MSI1
(fig. S4). We observed a modest MSI1-driven in-
crease in luciferase expression. The ability of MSI1
to promote ZIKV UTR–driven translation in vitro
raises the possibility that it performs a similar
function in vivo. Alternatively, MSI1 might stabi-
lize the viral RNA genome and/or regulate its
cyclization or synthesis. In addition, given the
pleiotropic roles of MSI1 in cellular pathways, it
is plausible that MSI1-dependent regulation of
gene expression contributes to the ZIKV life cycle
(19). However, MSI1 is unlikely to act through
general pro- or antiviral pathways, as infection
with H1N1 influenza virus was unaffected by
MSI1 expression levels (fig. S5). In line with pub-
lished work, we also find that MSI1 KO cells ex-
hibited defective migration, increased doubling
time, and cell-cycle delay (fig. S6) (17, 20, 21). Be-
cause ZIKV replication requires cyclin-dependent
kinase activity, such pro-proliferative effects ex-
erted by MSI1 might contribute to virus produc-
tion (22). Nevertheless, the direct interaction
between MSI1 and the ZIKV genome is consistent
with the hypothesis that the protein promotes
some aspect of the viral life cycle.
ZIKV predominantly infects neural progen-
itors in human fetal brain. We find MSI1 to be
abundant in neural precursors of the ventricular

 and subventricular zones of the human embryonic
brain, but absent from mature neurons (Fig. 3A
and fig. S7). Owing to its high levels in neural pro-
genitors, and its ability to stimulate ZIKV replica-
tion, MSI1 could be instrumental to ZIKV-induced
cytopathicity in the fetal brain. In addition, MSI1
is required for neurodevelopment in both inver-
tebrates and vertebrates, with MSI1-depleted
zebrafish displaying microcephaly and mutant
mice exhibiting a thin cerebral cortex and reduced
number of mature neural cell types, among other
morphological brain abnormalities (14, 19, 23–25).
We have identified a consanguineous Turkish
family in which two siblings displayed clinical
features suggestive of autosomal primary micro-
cephaly (MCPH), a condition associated with a
considerable reduction in cerebral cortex size,
but a structurally normal brain (fig. S8, A and B)
(26, 27). Exome sequencing uncovered potential-
ly deleterious homozygous mutations in MSI1,
ACACB, DKK4, and DTX3L (fig. S8, C to F, and
tables S1 and S2). Of these, only MSI1 is known
to have neural functions, but because mutations
were present in four genes, the point mutation
causing the p.Ala184Val (A184V) substitution in
MSI1 may not be the sole cause of MCPH in these
individuals (referred to as MSI1A184V). Neverthe-
less, three lines of evidence show that A184V mu-
tant MSI1 is functionally impaired. First, MSI1A184V
patient cells exhibit premature chromosome con-
densation (PCC), the same phenotype as MSI1-
deficient glioblastoma cells. Second, we show
that the A184V mutation impedes RNA bind-
ing of MSI1, leading to deregulated expression
of its endogenous targets. Third, we find that the
A184V mutant MSI1 is unable to support ZIKV
replication.
The PCC phenotype seen in MSI1A184V-patient
cells has been previously described in cells deficient

Downloaded from 
 of the MCPH-associated protein microcephalin
(MCPH1) (fig. S8G) (28, 29). Because the MCPH1
locus is unaffected in MSI1A184V patients, we
speculated that MSI1 could control chromosome
condensation by regulating MCPH1 expression.
To determine if MCPH1 was a MSI1 target, we
performed RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) under
native conditions. In addition to its known targets
NUMB, p21WAF1, and the MCPH-associated gene
CDK6/MCPH12, MSI1 co-precipitated with two
isoforms of MCPH1 (MCPH1_S and MCPH_L),
despite their divergent 3′UTRs, but did not
interact with other MCPH genes tested (fig. S9,
A and B) (12, 30, 31). CLIP and RNA electropho-
retic mobility shift assays suggest a direct inter-
action between MSI1 and MCPH1_L (Fig. 3, B
and C). MSI1 can act as a translational suppressor
(e.g., for NUMB and p21WAF1) or activator (e.g.,
for CDK6) (12, 21, 30). Consistent with a role for
MSI1 in translational activation of MCPH1, we
observed low MCPH1 protein levels in MSI1A184V-
patient and MSI1-deficient U-251 cells and a reduc-
tion in polysome-associated MCPH1 transcripts
in KO cells (Fig. 3, D and E, and figs. S9C and S10).
Given that MSI1 interacts with ZIKV RNA, and
that viral RNA is abundant in the infected cell, the
viral genome could compete with endogenous tar-
gets for binding MSI1. Indeed, upon ZIKV infection
of U-251 cells, we observed a marked reduction in
the interaction between MSI1 and its target RNAs,
including MCPH1 and NUMB, accompanied by
changes in their protein levels that mirrored those
of MSI1 KO cells (Fig. 3, F and G).

 MSI1 interacts with target transcripts through
its two RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) (19, 30, 32).
Nuclear magnetic resonance studies show that
the conserved Ala184 within the RRM2 is an
RNA-binding residue (33). Modeling based on
the crystal structure of the RNA-binding protein
HRP1 with RNA indicates that the A184V mu-
tation impairs the MSI1-RNA interaction (Fig. 4A).
To evaluate the effect of A184V on MSI1 function
in cells, transgenes encoding wild-type (WT) and
A184V MSI1 (MsiWT and MsiAV, respectively) were
randomly integrated into KO1 or KO2 U-251 cells,
and single clones were isolated (KO1/2-MsiWT
or KO1/2-MsiAV). MSI1 protein expression in these
clones was quantified with respect to endogenous
protein levels in parental cells (Fig. 4B). When
compared to KO2-MsiWT cells, MSI1 RIP recov-
ered two- to fourfold fewer target transcripts
from KO2-MsiAV, indicative of reduced RNA
binding by the A184V mutant (Fig. 4C). NUMB
and MCPH1 protein levels changed accordingly
(Fig. 4B). These results were recapitulated in
HEK293T cells expressing Msi1WT or Msi1AV
(fig. S11). MSI1A184V, MSI1 KO, KO1/2-MsiAV,
and MSI1-depleted cells all exhibited suboptimal
MCPH1 protein levels and PCC, prompting us to
investigate if a functional link existed between
these phenotypes (fig. S9, C to F). MCPH1 over-
expression reduced PCC frequency in MSI1-
depleted cells, thereby confirming a role for MSI1
in chromosome condensation through translation-
al control of MCPH1 (fig. S8, G and H). Therefore,
the A184V mutation impairs binding of MSI1 to

Fig. 3. MSI1 is enriched in neural progenitors and regulates micro-
cephalin (MCPH1) expression. (A) Immunohistochemistry of human
embryonic brain at postconception week (pcw) 10 and 12. Tissue sections
stained with antibodies against MSI1 (red) combined with neuron-specific
b-III tubulin (green), or the apical neural progenitor marker Nestin (green).
DNA is detected by 4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (blue). Note that
MSI1 is enriched in neural progenitors at the ventricular and subventricular
zones (VZ and SVZ, respectively) but is absent from the cortical plate
(CP). (B) MSI1 CLIP from U-251 cells with genotypes as indicated. CLIP
was performed with rabbit IgG or MSI1 antibodies. Graphs show qPCRs of
bound transcripts. n = 3 biological replicates. (C) RNA electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis to detect binding between MCPH1_L
3′UTR and purified GST-MSI1 recombinant protein (GST, glutathione
S-transferase). Coomassie staining of corresponding purified proteins is
shown below. (D) Western blots of parental, control, KO1, and KO2 cell
lines. Blots were probed with antibodies as indicated. p150 serves as
loading control. (E) Western blots of whole-cell lysates from MSI1A184V
parent-of-patient– and patient-derived primary lymphocytes. Blots were
probed with antibodies as indicated. MSI1 levels are unchanged. (F) MSI1
RIP from mock- and ZIKV-infected U-251 cells (MOI: 1 FFU/cell, 72 hours).
Rabbit IgG or MSI1 antibodies were used for IP. Input corresponds to
10% of whole-cell extract. Western blot was probed with MSI1 antibody.
Graphs below show amounts of bound RNAs, including ZIKV genome and
endogenous target transcripts. RIP values are presented as a percentage
of input after subtraction of the IgG background. MR766 and PE243
were quantitated by TaqMan assay and endogenous transcripts with SYBR
qPCR. Bar charts depict mean ± SEM. n = 3 biological replicates. (G)
Western blots of PE243-infected U-251 cells (MOI: 1 FFU/cell, 72 hours).
Blots were probed with antibodies as indicated. a-tubulin serves as loading
control. MSI1 positively regulates MCPH1 and CDK6 and negatively regulates
NUMB and p21 protein levels. P values were obtained from Student’s t test,
unpaired, two-tailed: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.005; n.s., not significant.

Fig. 4. The A184V MCPH mutation disrupts RNA binding by MSI1 and
impairs the ability of MSI1 to drive ZIKV replication. (A) Structural
model of MSI1 (blue) and HRP1-RNA complex (gray-orange) predicts that the
A184V mutation impairs the interaction with RNA because of a steric clash.

 RNA, which leads to reduced MCPH1 expression
and a concomitant increase in PCC frequency.
Notably, defective chromosome condensation has
been recently found to cause MCPH (34).
Given that the A184V mutation impedes binding
of MSI1 to RNA, we next probed the effect of
A184V mutant MSI1 on ZIKV replication. To
this end, viral RNA levels and cell viability were
assayed in KO1/2, KO1/2-MsiWT, and KO1/2-MsiAV
U-251 cells infected with PE243. Complementation
of KO1/2 cells with MsiWT increased both ZIKV
RNA levels and cell death (Fig. 4, D and E). By
contrast, MsiAV was unable to support ZIKV
replication and showed minimal impact on cell
viability. Additionally, in HEK293T cells, expres-
sion of MsiWT, but not MsiAV, increased viral
RNA and cell death upon infection (Fig. 4, F and
G, and fig. S12). These findings also imply that MSI1
expression increases susceptibility of HEK293T
cells to ZIKV infection (35). Furthermore, we noted
an apparent dose-dependent effect of MSI1 on
viral replication; those U-251 and HEK293T clones
that express higher levels of MSI1 displayed greater
viral RNA levels and increased cell death (Fig. 4, B
and D to G, and figs. S11 and S12).
Our study raises the question of whether MSI1
could have functions in other flaviviruses. We
have surveyed putative MSI1 binding sites in a
number of flaviviruses by mapping the consen-
sus site [A/GU(1 to 3)AG] onto predicted second-
ary structures of flaviviridae 3′UTRs obtained
from a recent publication (table S3) (16). Although
several flaviviruses harbor consensus MSI1 sites
in appropriate structural landscapes, whether
MSI1 is relevant to the biology of these viruses
remains to be established. Furthermore, where-
as our data are consistent with a role for MSI1
in ZIKV neurotropism and pathology, multiple
factors must collude in ZIKV infection of the fetal
brain, not least of which are viral entry receptors
that allow the virus to cross the placental barrier
(36). Viruses such as human cytomegalovirus and
Rubella can also access the developing fetal brain,
but whether MSI1 contributes to their replication
or pathogenesis is unknown and would require
further study.
This work suggests that high MSI1 expression
levels in neural precursors could be a key con-
tributor to the fetal neurotropism exhibited by
ZIKV (2, 10, 37) (fig. S13). Intriguingly, MSI1 is also
highly expressed in the retina and testis, other tis-
sues deemed vulnerable to ZIKV infection (38–41).
Although our study provides new insight into the
potential pathogenic mechanisms of ZIKV, further
work will be required to determine if the mod-
ification or interference of the MSI1-ZIKV inter-
action results in neuronal attenuation of ZIKV.
