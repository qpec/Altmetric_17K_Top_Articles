Varied Reports of Adult Transgender Suicidality:
Synthesizing and Describing the Peer-Reviewed
and Gray Literature
Noah Adams,1,* Maaya Hitomi,2 and Cherie Moody3
Abstract
Purpose: This article reports on the findings of a meta-synthesis undertaken on published gray transgender sui-
cidality literature, to determine the average rate of suicidal ideation and attempts in this population.
Methods: Studies included in this synthesis were restricted to the 42 that reported on 5 or more Canadian or U.S.
adult participants, as published between 1997 and February 2016 in either gray or peer-reviewed health literature.
Results: Across these 42 studies an average of 55% of respondents ideated about and 29% attempted suicide in
their lifetimes. Within the past year, these averages were, respectively, 51% and 11%, or 14 and 22 times that of the
general public. Overall, suicidal ideation was higher among individuals of a male-to-female (MTF) than female-to-
male (FTM) alignment, and lowest among those who were gender non-conforming (GNC). Conversely, attempts
occurred most often among FTM individuals, then decreased for MTF individuals, followed by GNC individuals.
Conclusion: These findings may be useful in creating targeted interventions that take into account both the
alarmingly high rate of suicidality in this population, and the relatively differential experience of FTM, MTF,
and GNC individuals. Future research should examine minority stress theory and suicidality protection/resilience
factors, particularly transition, on this population.

Introduction
In recent years, transgender individuals have rapidly
gained visibility. Despite this, they continue to be at
risk for negative life events that adversely affect their
health and well-being, such as being rendered invisible,
experiencing isolation, and being subjected to societal
violence.1 Perhaps as a result, current and past studies
report appallingly high rates of suicidality (attempts
and ideation) in this population. For instance, Scanlon
et al.,1 reported an attempt rate of 43% and an ideation
rate of 77% among transgender Ontarians, compared
to 0.5% and 3.7%, respectively, in the general popula-
tion.2,3 Unfortunately, the applicability of these find-
ings in guiding policy and future research is impacted
by wide variation in the findings of suicidality
rates.4,5 For example, Xavier et al.6 report an attempt
rate of 25% and an ideation rate of 65%, while Imbimbo
et al.7 record rates of 3% and 50%, respectively. The
current meta-synthesis attempts to address these dis-
crepancies by measuring the overall variation across
and averaging the suicidality rates within these studies.
This knowledge may encourage the creation of targeted
and strategic mental health interventions and research.
Literature review
Historical trends.
The field of transgender healthcare
has been described by Bockting8 as evolving from uti-
lizing a disease-based lens of transgender health and
behavior to an identity-based lens. Within this frame-

 disease-based lens appears to have been prevalent from
1953, when the first report on transgender suicidality
was published9 until roughly 1997. This period was
characterized by research that viewed transgender health
and identity as fundamentally psychopathological, devi-
ant, and manipulative.10–13 Despite no empirical sup-
port, many healthcare professionals tended to view
suicidality as a manipulative tactic to force surgery,14
which would invariably lead to poor mental health out-
comes, such as suicide and psychotic breakdown.15 In
fact, evidence existed that suggested the opposite: that
improvement tended to be drastic following surgery.16
The utilization of an identity-based lens appears to
have begun to overtake the disease-based lens in roughly
1997, with the publication of Devor’s17 seminal study on
female-to-male (FTM) transsexuals. The identity-based
lens is characterized by the assumption that transgender
identity is part of a natural spectrum that includes iden-
tities beyond those that are male or female, feminine or
masculine.8 Proponents of this lens argue that physical
and psychological stress, resultant from institutional
and societal discrimination, are major contributors to
suicidality in this population.1,18,19
While the disease-based lens continues to be used,8
particularly outside of North America,20 there is in-
creasing disagreement as to whether the cause of trans-
gender identity is mental, hormonal, biological, and/or
genetic.21 Similarly, suicidality in this population is var-
iously attributed to psychopathology, neurobiology,22
and/or antitransgender stigma.19
Meta-analyses and systematic reviews.
Ten system-
atic reviews or meta-analyses have mentioned suicidal-
ity among transgender people; however, only Marshall
et al.,23 approached this as the primary question and
was designed to include all articles on transgender sui-
cidality. Nevertheless, although an important contribu-
tion to the literature and even accounting for the
parameters of their review, Marshall et al.23 appear to
have missed several studies (numbers 2, 5–11, 16, 19–
21, 23–26, 32–33, 35, and 42 in Table 1), and counted
a single research project three times (37 in Table 1).
The remaining nine reviews and meta-analyses,
while important, largely address transgender suicidality
as a secondary question in relation to other issues, such
as HIV or geographical location. As such, these articles
do not encompass the breadth of transgender suicidal-
ity literature addressed in this meta-synthesis. For ex-
ample Meads et al.91 restricts itself to one region in
England, while Herbst et al.92 focuses primarily on
HIV prevalence and risk factors which, though com-
mon in this field, is not reflective of all transgender in-
dividuals.21 Finally, the articles by Pauly,93–96 the
Wessex Institute for Health Research and Develop-
ment,97 and Lundstro
¨m et al.98 address transgender
suicidality vis-a-vis the impact of gender confirmation
surgery, finding the persistently held notion that trans-
gender individuals experience higher rates of suicidal-
ity after gender confirming surgery to be unfounded
(indeed, suicidality has been recorded to be most com-
mon when requests for surgery are refused).15
Method
Eligibility criteria
All studies included in this meta-synthesis reported data
from original participant research investigating transgen-
der suicide attempts and/or ideation. Both gray and
peer-reviewed academic literature were included, as the
formerallowed for a larger data pooland helped to reduce
the impact of publication bias, where research with non-
significant findings may be published in a thesis, but not
a peer-reviewed journal. Studies were included if they
were published in English-language North American
(Canada and the United States) journals, between 1997
and February 1, 2016. These studies must also have
reported quantitative data on suicidality among five or
more transgender participants with a diagnosis of gender
dysphoria and/or self-identification as transgender. Fur-
ther, the majority (50% +1) of participants must have
been 18 years or older at the time of participation.
Additionally, a word about the inclusion of cross-
dressers (CDs). It is noted that there are many terms
used by transgender individuals to define their experi-
ence of gender and gender identity.65,99 The term CD,
which identifies individuals ‘‘who dress in clothing or
express their gender in ways that society deems incon-
sistent with the sex they were assigned at birth’’ is com-
monly used for this purpose.99 In the case of this study,
CDs are included because they answered research calls
for transgender people and because in most cases this
identity cannot be assumed to be exclusive of other
transgender identities.
Studies were excluded if they reported only on com-
pleted suicides or nonsuicidal self-injury, single case
reports, or included a transgender cohort as part of a
larger population (e.g., LGB) without providing dis-
crete transgender data. This includes reports that refer-
enced, but did not provide data on investigations into
transgender suicidality. Additionally, research that
resulted in multiple publications was only counted

Discusses victimization and psychological distress among transgender college students via
clinical (Fall 2008) and nonclinical (Spring 2010) samples. The clinical sample is
comprised of college counseling center patients where, unlike the nonclinical sample,
‘‘other’’ was not a gender option. The nonclinical sample consisted of respondents to a
survey conducted by colleges aligned with the counseling centers. Both used the same
survey measure; however, institutions varied in their use of incentives and completion
prompts. Effrig et al.50 contains contradictory figures for both the number and
suicidality of nonclinical and clinical participants, although it was possible to rationalize
these figures, revealing a probable 65 nonclinical and 32 clinical participants. We have
combined the nonclinical and clinical data because the articles don’t provide enough

 once, while the most recently published report was of
primary import, though all reports published on a sin-
gle study were reviewed for pertinent information.
Finally, all included studies were reported in a primar-
ily written format, thus excluding posters and other
visual presentations.
Data collection
Rates of transgender suicidality were collected from in-
cluded studies. Data absent from the included articles
were supplemented by interviews with the study
authors. However, to ensure the confidentiality prom-
ised as a condition of these interviews and required
by the original Research Ethics Board approval,
obtained through Dalhousie University, we have not
indicated where this supplementation occurred.
Literature.
Transgender suicidality literature was pri-
marily identified via the WorldCat database because it is
oneofthelargestglobaldigitalcatalogsofcross-referenced
and multi-disciplinary material. This search was supple-
mented with and cross-checked against results from
Google Scholar and Google Search and later by manually
reviewing the reference lists of identified articles, which
resulted in the identification of a small number of addi-
tional articles. University of Calgary suicidality research
Richard Ramsay’s collated list of transgender suicidality
studies was also invaluable.100 The following key terms
were used when searching WorldCat, Google Scholar,
and in Google Search; ‘‘transgender suicide’’; ‘‘transsexual
suicide’’; ‘‘FTM suicide’’; ‘‘MTF suicide’’; ‘‘transsexual sui-
cidality’’; ‘‘transgender suicidality’’; ‘‘transgender suicide
attempt’’; and ‘‘transsexual suicide attempt.’’
Of the 2016 records identified, 1005 duplicates were
immediately eliminated. The titles and abstracts of the
remaining articles were screened (Fig. 1). After exclud-
ing reference lists, non-English language publications,
audiovisual reports, and those that did not mention
transgender suicidality in either the title or the abstract,
311 articles remained. The full texts of these articles
were reviewed. Those further eliminated include arti-
cles that reported no original data on transgender sui-
cide attempts and/or ideation (105), meta-analyses/
reviews of transgender suicidality (10), those with no/
unclear quantitative data (42), articles published before
1997 (31), those not from the United States or Canada
(43), those where the majority of participants were
under 18 at the time of first data collection (5), and
those with less than five participants (3). The remain-
ing 72 articles, representing 42 distinct research studies
(some published multiple times), were examined in the
qualitative synthesis, while the 3 that reported suicidal-
ity as an amalgamate of ideation and attempts were ex-
cluded from the quantitative synthesis.32–33,62,84
Data analysis
The 42 studies on transgender suicidality are subjected
here to a simple descriptive analysis, with the intention
of summarizing the statistics on transgender suicidality
included in the source research, and providing inroads
to a more thorough examination in the future. To this
end, individual studies’ suicidality statistics (total num-
ber of participants, mean suicidality, range) were recal-
culated where possible using all study participants as a
denominator. We considered but chose not to use only
participants that responded to a given suicidality ques-
tion because relatively few studies reported enough
raw data to reliably and consistently calculate this fig-
ure. Similarly, we noted that the 42 studies differed in
whether they reported ideation and attempts separately
or in an amalgamate. We have compensated for this by
separating these statistics where enough raw data are
available to make this possible. Where this was not pos-
sible (three cases) we recorded the given figures as is
and did not use them in subsequent calculations of
cross-study suicidality averages. Note that, beyond
these actions and the criteria set for inclusion on this
meta-synthesis, no additional measures were taken to
account for varying study designs.
After processing the individual studies as described,
we combined their suicidality statistics and calculated
the overall mean rate of suicidal ideation and attempts
for the 39 that measured these as independent factors
and excluding the 3 that combined these figures. Varia-
tion is operationalized in the current meta-synthesis as
any difference between the calculated study ideation
and attempt means and the overall ideation and attempt
means for all studies included. After calculating these
studies by comparing these means according to partici-
pants’ gender identity and over time (ever, past year, and
before treatment/transition/when participants first felt
transgender). We also compared the range of suicidality
figures reported by these studies. These calculations
were conducted with the aid of Excel and SPSS v. 23.
Results
Methodologies and study design
Of the 42 studies analyzed here, 11.9% (n = 5) were
Canadian, with the remaining 88.1% (n = 37) originating
in the United States. Beginning with an average of 1 per

 year, there are now *4 publications per year on this
topic, with a high of 11 in 2011. Interestingly, despite
the inclusion of gray literature, only six studies were
solely published outside of a formal peer-reviewed for-
mat. Of these, one took the form of a thesis, while the
remaining five were published in reports to communi-
ties, research granting agencies, governmental bodies,
or as part of rigorous analyses by academic think tanks.
Eleven studies have included cisgender comparison
or control groups, all of which were published since
2002, and 82% (n = 9) since 2009. In comparing the
research designs of all 42 studies, we see that 11.9%
(n = 5) used case series, 59.5% (n = 25) used cross-
sectional, 19% used case control (n = 8), and 9.5%
used cohort (n = 4) designs, with a marked increase
in the latter two since 2009 (83% of 12 total). Addi-
tionally, 73.8% (n = 31) of these studies took place in
a nonclinical setting, 23.8% (n = 10) in a clinical set-
ting, and 2.4% (n = 1) in combined clinical and
nonclinical settings. Finally, four different meth-
ods of data collection were employed, with 69%
(n=29) using self-administered questionnaires, 31%
(n = 13) administered questionnaires, 14.3% (n = 6)
face-to-face interviews, and 16.7% (n = 7) chart reviews.
Participant demographics
The individual studies that make up this meta-
synthesis include from 9 to 6441 participants, for an

majority 18 years of age or older (50% +1).

 estimated total of 25,735 transgender individuals. Of
these, *4625 could be distinctly classified as FTM,
9698 as male-to-female (MTF), 1377 as gender non-
conforming (GNC), and 939 as CDs. The majority of
participants were male assigned at birth (MAAB;
n = 15,074 vs. female assigned at birth [FAAB];
n = 8697). Additionally, though inconsistently recorded
and difficult to track, four studies reported on a total of
13 intersex participants (Table 1).
The majority of studies excluded all participants
under 18 years of age (n = 32), though36–38,40,80–83,88
reported a minority under this age (2.94–33.3%). In
the remaining cases,1,28–30,43,50,51,73–78,85–87 while it
was apparent that the majority of the sample was
over 18 years at the time of participation, insufficient
information was provided to determine the exact num-
ber and proportion of those under this age.
Suicidality
Of the 42 studies analyzed, 83% (n = 35) asked partici-
pants about lifetime ideation and/or attempts, while
36% (n = 15) measured suicidality specific to a particu-
lar period either instead of, or in addition to this. (In
one case, suicidality was recorded over a period of 17
years, which was treated as lifetime suicidality in the
following calculations.) In addition to different studies
assessing either ideation and attempts during different
time frames (e.g., lifetime or part year), several studies
assessed both ideation and attempts over different pe-
riods (e.g., lifetime ideation, attempts in past year)
and/or for different gender identities and/or sexes
assigned at birth.
Suicidal
ideation
and
attempts
were
typically
reported separately; for example, 67% (n = 28) of the
studies assessed ideation and 81% (n = 34) assessed at-
tempts. Additionally, three studies (7, 28, and 38 in
Table 1) amalgamated ideation and attempts into a sin-
gle figure, one of which investigated suicidality over the
lifetime, one in the past 3 years, and one in 2011 alone.
These three studies have therefore been excluded from
the subsequent synthesis of suicidality statistics.
Lifetime suicidality.
As seen in Figure 2, when suici-
dality statistics are averaged across all studies and
analyzed by participants’ gender identity, there is a ten-
dency for MTF participants to ideate somewhat more
often than FTM participants (51.7% vs. 45.4%), while
attempts are virtually identical (31% vs. 32.3%). GNC
individuals appear to ideate (30%) and attempt
(25.6%) less than MTF and FTM individuals, while

 CD individuals experience perhaps the least suicidality
of the four groups (16.9% ideation).
Suicidality over a specific period.
As seen in Figure 3,
the most common time period used for measuring sui-
cidality was over the lifetime (n = 23 for ideation; n = 32
for attempts), followed by the past year (n = 5 for idea-
tion; n = 5 for attempts). Additionally, four studies mea-
sured suicidality surrounding transition (e.g., when
participants first felt transgender, before treatment, be-
fore transition, and after surgery). Of this group, only
the three (n = 2 for ideation; n = 2 for attempts) that in-
vestigated suicidality before treatment, transition, or
when participants first felt transgender (representing a
combined total of 3531 individuals) could reasonably
be compared. Finally, one study measured ideation in
the past 30 days.
The

rate
of
suicidal
ideation
(M = 55.5%; range = 28.9–96.5%) and attempts (M =
28.9%; range = 10.7–52.4%) were calculated across the
23 and 32 studies for which these behaviors were, re-
spectively, recorded. Similarly, we see the average and
range of suicidality over the past year (ideation
M = 50.6%; range = 30.8–80.2%; attempt M = 10.7%;
range = 4.2–19%). Of equal import, this data set dem-
onstrates the average and range of suicidality before
transition (ideation M = 36.1%; range = 16.6–55.6%; at-
tempt M = 13.1%; range = 11.1–15%).
Discussion
Findings
Methodologically speaking, much has changed within
the period covered by this meta-synthesis. For example,
there appears to have been an increase in methodolog-
ical rigor, particularly in terms of study design and the
use of comparison groups. Furthermore, the majority of
transgender suicidality research now takes place in non-
clinical environments, which is a marked contrast from
the beginning of this period and the previous era. Dem-
ographically, these studies have included proportion-
ately more MTF and MAAB participants than FTM/
FAAB, GNC, or CD. Interestingly, CD appears to be
something of a remnant of an older period in North
American transgender culture, no longer in widespread
use, at least as seen in recent academic publications.
In the studies examined in the current meta-
synthesis, an average of 56% of participants experi-
enced lifetime suicidal ideation and 29% had ever
attempted suicide. Given the rate of suicidality in the
general population, 0.5%2 and 3.7%,3 respectively, it

with those that measured this before transition. The numbers in brackets represent, first, the number of
studies that recorded ideation statistics and second, the number that recorded attempt statistics. Studies
that measured suicidality in ‘‘the past year’’ and ‘‘past 12 months’’ were combined. Little information was
available for suicidality before transition (three studies total, two each for ideation and attempts) and the
category is a combination of before treatment, when participants first felt trans, and before transition.

70
 is clear that transgender individuals are disproportion-
ately impacted by this phenomenon. Indeed, even over
the past year, where 51% of participants ideated and
11% attempted, suicidality is approximately 14 and
22 times higher than in the general public. MTF partic-
ipants also appear to experience more ideation and
roughly equal attempts as their FTM counterparts,
though both groups ideate and attempt more than par-
ticipants identified as GNC, followed by those identi-
fied as CD. Finally, the vast majority of studies
explored suicidality at any point in a participants’ life-
time, either in addition to, or instead of time-specific
measures ( past year, before transition). Of those that
did record time-specific measures, the majority did so
for the past year.
We can also theorize on the impact of time and tran-
sition on suicidality, though only in an exploratory
fashion. For example, as expected, when we compare
lifetime to past year suicidality we find that ideation
(55% vs. 51%) and especially attempts (29% vs. 11%)
decrease. It seems counterintuitive, on the other
hand, that suicide attempts are lower before transition
(ideation 36.1%; attempt 13.1%) than over most other
periods (past year attempts being the exception). How-
ever, we may expect to find higher rates of suicidality
over the lifetime because this is a category that repre-
sents a non-transition specific and cumulative experi-
ence, in contrast to the single period represented by
before transition. It may also be the case that individu-
als who do not desire transition represent a less
dysphoric group and are therefore less suicidal.64 By
contrast,
evidence
is
mounting
that
barriers
to
transition-related healthcare contribute to suicidality
among those who desire such measures63,78 and though
it sometimes increases during transition,78 it typically
decreases once desired transitional goals are complet-
ed.30,102 Indeed, a recent qualitative inquiry into suicide
protective factors among trans adults identified several
important protective factors among this population,
one of which was socially and/or medically transition-
ing (for those who seek it).103 Additionally, suicidality
may be generally higher among transgender individu-
als than the general population throughout the life
course, due to factors unrelated to transition, such as
stigma and discrimination.20,55,78
Implications
The results of the current meta-synthesis can inform a
number of potential transgender healthcare strategies.
For example, as noted above, there is growing evidence
for the role of both antitransgender discrimination and
transitional services in suicidality among this popula-
tion, with the former implicated in heightened suicidal-
ity and the provision of the latter in its reduction.
Physical healthcare providers may, therefore, find it ad-
visable to reduce barriers to transition, while mental
healthcare providers should be prepared to support
transgender clients in seeking out, preparing for, and
obtaining these services. Nevertheless, given the con-
tinued vulnerability of this population, mental health-
care practitioners should also be prepared to develop
and reinforce this populations’ resiliency against anti-
transgender stigma and discrimination, as well as pre-
pare them for the possible increase of stress during
transition. This may also include supporting and par-
ticipating in policy and legislative measures arguing
for transgender healthcare and human rights protec-
tions and decrying attempts to discriminate against
this population (e.g., The American Psychiatric Associ-
ation’s Position Statement on Transgender and Gender
Variant Individuals,104 The American Medical Associ-
ations’ resolution on Removing Financial Barriers to
Care for Transgender Patients,105 and the American
Academy of Pediatrics Statement in Opposition of
Legislation that Discriminates Against Transgender
Children).106
Limitations
The results of this meta-synthesis are very preliminary
and there are a number of limitations inherent to a
study of this kind, relying as it does on datasets that
are methodologically varied. For example, relatively
few studies reported on lifetime suicidality among indi-
viduals identified as GNC and CD, with the result that
the analysis here is limited in generalizability. Similarly,
relatively few studies measured suicidality either before
transition or in the past year and it was, therefore, nec-
essary to amalgamate several similar categories into the
before transition group (before treatment, when partic-
ipants first felt trans, and before transition). As noted,
beyond the criteria set for an individual study’s inclu-
sion in this meta-synthesis and the actions taken to ac-
count for variation in their calculation of suicidality, no
additional measures were taken to account for varying
study designs and methodology.
Similarly, as is true within the broader field of
transgender health, definitions of gender identity
vary widely across these 42 studies. While documenta-
tion of nonbinary identities has increased in recent
years107 researchers continue to struggle to account
Adams, et al.; Transgender Health 2017, 2.1
http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/trgh.2016.0036
71
 for the diversity among nonbinary individuals or re-
spond to the rapid shifts in acceptable and preferred
language within this community.108
The manner in which researchers inquired about sui-
cidality is also concerning. For example, some research-
ers63 note that yes/no questions, such as ‘‘have you ever
attempted suicide?’’ tend to overestimate positive re-
sponses from those who have self-harmed, but not
attempted to end their life. This might be corrected by
questioning participants’ intent to die through in-person
interviews, which have been found to reduce attempt
rates from 4.6% to 2.7% of an adult sample.109,110
Unfortunately, only 14% of the 42 studies included here
collected data primarily from face-to-face interviews.
Future research
There is a lack of research into transgender people’s ex-
periences of minority stress111 and resiliency61 particu-
larly the impact of transition-related interventions on
suicidality.52 Researchers may also wish to include an
additional measure reflecting current lived gender pre-
sentation which, owing to prejudice and/or other prac-
tical concerns, may differ from ones’ core identity. It
may also be the case that participants’ gender identity
evolves and shifts, and it is therefore difficult to capture
this without asking participants to account for all pre-
viously held identities, rather than just that held in the
moment of data collection.
Additionally, researchers might also explore the po-
tential for bias in studies conducted in clinical environ-
ments, as participants may be dependent on the clinical
environment for transition-related care. Consistent
with social desirability bias, asking about suicidality
in these environments, especially if not anonymously,
may reinforce a transitional narrative where partici-
pants feel pressured to give a more positive picture of
their mental health for fear of being denied, losing, or
being forced to wait longer than necessary for life-
saving transition-related services112,113 Indeed, the
practice of delaying transitional treatment due to co-
morbid symptomatology like depression and suicidal-
ity is widely practiced,114 though evidence is mounting
against the efficacy and ethics of this approach.78 While
set guidelines for transgender suicidality research
would help to address this and other concerns, such a
tool might not be help to address the expectation of
bias created by the optics of the situation (e.g., that pa-
tients may not feel comfortable sharing their experi-
ences of suicidality with those responsible for their
care, where they are suspected to impact it).
Several decades of research have been conducted re-
garding suicidality experienced by transgender individu-
als. As summarized in the current meta-synthesis, rates of
both ideation and attempts vary a great deal in subgroups
of transgender individuals (FTM, MTF, GNC, CD), and
based on several factors (e.g., type of questions asked,
data collection method). The current meta-synthesis is
the first of its kind to summarize 19 years of this impor-
tant research and make sense of the 42 studies published
in that time. It is our hope that the current article is a
small but important addition to the body of knowledge
regarding transgender suicidality and that the results
may be used to inform future research and best practices.
