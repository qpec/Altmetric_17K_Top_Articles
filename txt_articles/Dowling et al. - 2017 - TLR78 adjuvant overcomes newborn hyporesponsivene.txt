Introduction
Early life immunization is desirable, but vaccine-induced responses of newborns and young infants demon-
strate slow initiation, low immunogenicity, and reduced persistence of functional antibodies (Abs) and 
cell-mediated responses (1). Although the majority of global immunization schedules are focused on the 
pediatric age group, development of early life vaccines has been hampered by this distinct immunity and 
an ad hoc approach in developing vaccines for adults prior to infant trials (2). By comparison to initiation 
of immunization in infancy, accelerated neonatal immunization strategies may be highly advantageous (3, 
4) because (a) newborn vaccines achieve relatively high population penetration, as birth is the most reliable 
point of health care contact worldwide (5); (b) there is high risk of severe infection after very early life col-
onization; and (c) reduced vaccine responses can occur after bacterial colonization (6, 7). Adjuvantation is 
a key tool to enhance vaccine-induced immunity. Adjuvants can enhance, prolong, and modulate immune 
responses to vaccinal antigens to maximize protective immunity (8) and may potentially enable effective 
immunization in the very young (1). However, responses of human newborn leukocytes to most adjuvants, 
including most TLR agonists (TLRAs), are functionally distinct (2).
Considerations in selecting a clinically relevant adjuvanted vaccine formulation include (a) minimiz-
Infection is the most common cause of mortality in early life, and immunization is the most 
promising biomedical intervention to reduce this burden. However, newborns fail to respond 
optimally to most vaccines. Adjuvantation is a key approach to enhancing vaccine immunogenicity, 
but responses of human newborn leukocytes to most candidate adjuvants, including most TLR 
agonists, are functionally distinct. Herein, we demonstrate that 3M-052 is a locally acting lipidated 
imidazoquinoline TLR7/8 agonist adjuvant in mice, which, when properly formulated, can induce 
robust Th1 cytokine production by human newborn leukocytes in vitro, both alone and in synergy 
with the alum-adjuvanted pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13 (PCV13). When admixed with 
PCV13 and administered i.m. on the first day of life to rhesus macaques, 3M-052 dramatically 
enhanced generation of Th1 CRM-197–specific neonatal CD4+ cells, activation of newborn and infant 
Streptococcus pneumoniae polysaccharide–specific (PnPS-specific) B cells as well as serotype-
specific antibody titers, and opsonophagocytic killing. Remarkably, a single dose at birth of PCV13 
plus 0.1 mg/kg 3M-052 induced PnPS-specific IgG responses that were approximately 10–100 
times greater than a single birth dose of PCV13 alone, rapidly exceeding the serologic correlate of 
protection, as early as 28 days of life. This potent immunization strategy, potentially effective with 
one birth dose, could represent a new paradigm in early life vaccine development.

ing systemic inflammation (9), which can occur with TLRAs included in soluble or, to a lesser extent, 
with TLRA adjuvant-conjugated nanoparticle-based formulations (10, 11), and (b) ensuring activity 
toward the target population — not a forgone conclusion in newborns, given age-specific soluble and cel-
lular factors (1) that shape distinct Th-mediated immunity (12), potentially limiting immune responses to 
vaccines and pathogens (13, 14). Our prior in vitro studies have suggested that, among the TLRAs, those 
that most effectively activate human newborn leukocytes are agonists of TLR7 and TLR8, a subfamily 
of endosomal leukocyte pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize uridine-rich single-strand-
ed RNA molecules, as are found in viral RNA, and synthetic imidazoquinolines (IMQs) (15–17). The 
activity of TLR7/8As toward neonatal leukocytes suggests possible utility as neonatal vaccine adjuvants. 
For example, when conjugated to particulate vaccinal antigen, free resiquimod (R848) can have adjuvant 
activity in nonhuman primates (NHPs) immunized in the first month of life, but with noticeable systemic 
inflammation (10). In addition, to our knowledge, no studies have addressed whether TLRA adjuvanta-
tion of common aluminum salt–adjuvanted (alum-adjuvanted) conjugate vaccines — key to the pediatric 
immunization schedule — is feasible and effective at birth (i.e., the first 24 hours of life), a key point of 
global healthcare contact (18), during which the immune system is most distinct (1). To test the hypothe-
sis that agents activating human neonatal leukocytes in vitro would also be active in newborns at birth in 
vivo, we undertook a rational vaccine design approach, employing a TLR7/8A adjuvant. We examined 
3M-052, a locally acting lipidated IMQ TLR7/8A that can induce tumor-specific immunity by forming 
agonist depots for a gradual sustained release (19).
Immunization approaches that lead to more rapid and early protection against pneumococcus would 
be highly advantageous (20). Pneumococcus is an important pediatric pathogen comprising ≥92 different 
capsular polysaccharide serotypes that cause serious invasive disease, including meningitis, sepsis, otitis 
media, and pneumonia; it is responsible for approximately 10% of worldwide deaths in children less than 5 
years of age (21). The poor efficacy of plain polysaccharide vaccines in young children prompted the devel-
opment of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) that induce T cell–dependent mechanisms (22), with 
a recommended 3- to 4-dose schedule starting at 2 months of age (23). However, PCV-induced protection 
may not be fully achieved until completion of the recommended vaccination schedule (12–18 months of 
life) (20), and the inclusion of alum, though safe and effective, appears to be Th2 polarizing (24) and results 
in a formulation that requires multiple doses prior to achieving protective Ab titers. In this context, we have 
selected PCV13, which protects against Streptococcus pneumoniae, as a model vaccine to adjuvant, because 
(a) PCV13 is a well-studied vaccine with known correlates of protection, which allows clear and unambigu-
ous evaluation of our adjuvantation strategy; (b) current PCVs can prevent severe disease in older children 
and offer newborns some indirect herd protection, but newborns are not directly protected; (c) pneumo-
coccal diseases strikes in early life, particularly in resource-poor countries, such as Papua New Guinea, 
making a vaccine that provides rapid protection in early life desirable (3, 4); and (d) although studies of 
PCV7 immunization, with a 3-dose schedule starting at birth, induced protective serum Ab concentrations 
in human infants as early as 18 weeks (4.5 months), neonatal hyporesponsiveness was noted for several 
vaccine serotypes, as compared with infants starting a 3-dose schedule of PCV7 at 2 months of life (24, 25).
Here, 3M-052 induced robust Th1 cytokine production by human newborn and adult leukocytes in 
vitro, both alone and in synergy with alum-adjuvanted PCV13. Using a potentially clinically relevant neo-
natal rhesus macaque model, we demonstrate that, when admixed with PCV13 and administered i.m., 
3M-052 dramatically accelerated and enhanced neonatal B and T cell immune responses, rapidly ampli-
fying functional serotype-specific Ab titers to concentrations that correlate with protection after the first 
dose of a 3-dose series (day of life 0 [DOL0], DOL28, and DOL56), without serious adverse effects. This 
rational design approach to identify adjuvants active toward distinct populations may be broadly applica-
ble, potentially closing the window of vulnerability to infections in early life.
Results
3M-052 is a locally acting TLR7/8 agonist. Key to preventing excessive adjuvant reactogenicity, includ-
ing fever and malaise, is avoiding systemic adjuvant distribution and consequent peripheral cytokine 
induction (9). We therefore selected 3M-052, a TLR7/8A that bears a C18 lipid moiety (11) that serves 
to localize its action. We conducted rodent pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) stud-
ies to compare the IMQ TLR7/8A R848 and its lipidated congener 3M-052 (Figure 1A), which can 
be formulated in an oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion vehicle (Supplemental Table 1; supplemental mate-

rial available online with this article; doi:10.1172/jci.insight.91020DS1). Distinct PK differences were 
observable by measurement of R848 or 3M-052 serum drug levels determined by liquid chromatogra-
phy–mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) before and after a single i.m. (into quadriceps) or s.c. (into scruff 
of neck) administration (Figure 1B). One hour after i.m. or s.c. injection in rats (both 1 mg/kg), serum 
R848 concentrations were >1,000 pmol/ml, while only a 4-hour peak of approximately 50 pmol/ml of 
3M-052 was detected at equal treatment dosages. After a 1 mg/kg dose, less than 1 pmol/ml of 3M-052 
was detectable in serum at 24 hours after dose, while a 100-fold lower dose of 3M-052 (0.01 mg/kg) was 
not detectable in serum up at any time. Blood TNF concentrations mirrored drug PK patterns, with a 
peak of approximately 1,000 pg/ml detectable in the R848-treated group and no induced systemic TNF 
detectable in any of the 3M-052–treated groups (Figure 1C). The relative PKs of R848 and 3M-052 
were further characterized in mice that received a single s.c. dose of R848 or 3M-052 (each ~0.1 mg/kg) 
(Figure 1D). These studies confirmed the serum TNF PK observations in rats and demonstrated distinct 
serum and inducible mRNA expression kinetics between R848 and 3M-052 for IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, and 
CCL2 (Figure 1D) in lymph node tissue (Supplemental Figure 1A) and splenocytes (Supplemental Fig-
ure 1B). In all cases, cytokine mRNA expression peaked at 1–3 hours after R848 administration and at 6 
hours after 3M-052 administration. s.c. administration of 3M-052 induced little if any cytokine mRNA 
expression but robust IFN-related and TLR7 gene expression in the spleens of treated mice (Supplemen-

tal Figure 1, A and B). Compared with R848, 3M-052 thus demonstrated reduced systemic distribution 
to the blood/serum, with induction of responses in the spleen suggesting confinement of this adjuvant to 
local and lymphatic leukocytes. Overall, although focused on adult and not newborn rodents, these data 
support the concept that 3M-052 has distinct advantages over R848 by being a locally acting adjuvant 
in vivo that avoids extensive systemic distribution and consequent induction of systemic inflammation.
3M-052 enhances type 1 immunity in vitro. To confirm activity of our adjuvanted vaccine formu-
lation toward neonatal leukocytes, we characterized cytokine-inducing activity of 3M-052 alone or 
in combination with the FDA-approved alum-containing 13-valent PCV (PCV13; Prevnar 13, Pfizer 
subsidiary, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) in vitro. We tested the ability of the alum-containing PCV13, 
3M-052, and the admixed formulation 3M-052 + PCV13 to induce concentration-dependent cytokine 
production in human neonatal and adult blood (Figure 2). As combining adjuvants such as alum (in 
the PCV13 formulation) and 3M-052 may have antagonistic, additive, or synergistic effects, we tested 
combinations of PCV13 + O/W (no 3M-052) or PCV13 + O/W formulated with 3M-052 (i.e., PCV13 
+ 3M-052) at multiple concentrations. Both PCV13 and O/W-formulated 3M-052 alone activated neo-
natal and adult blood in a concentration-dependent manner, significantly inducing production of TNF 
over baseline (n = 12, P < 0.001). The vehicle control did not induce TNF or IFN-γ production at any 
concentration tested (data not shown). Of note, 3M-052 + PCV13 synergistically induced TNF (n = 
12) and IFN-γ (n = 10) in both newborn cord and adult peripheral blood (Figure 1 and Supplemental 
Figure 2, A and B). Synergy between 3M-052 and the alum-adjuvanted PCV13 was of greatest mag-
nitude in neonatal blood (TNF, with a synergy measure D = 0.273; IFN-γ D = 0.118). The synergistic 
effects of 3M-052 + PCV13 were mainly restricted to Th1-polarizing cytokines TNF and IFN-γ, with 
some evidence of enhanced neonatal IL-12p70 and IL-6 as well (Supplemental Figures 3 and 4). These 
human in vitro whole blood data were consistent with the ability of 3M-052 to act in combination 
with alum to induce a mixed Th1/Th2-response and enhance influenza hemagglutinin-specific IgG2a 
production when administered to mice in vivo (Supplemental Figure 5 and 6).

Addition of  a TLR7/8A accelerates neonatal serotype-specific Ab responses to PCV13. 
Having demonstrated a low reactogenicity potential of 3M-052 in vivo as well as a 
high Th1/Th2-polarizing activity toward human neonatal leukocytes in vitro and 
mice in vivo, we next assessed the effect of 3M-052 on PCV13 immunogenicity in 
neonatal animals. As human TLR8 is structurally and functionally divergent from 
murine TLR8, but is closely similar to monkey TLR8 (26), we conducted our study 
in NHPs (Indian origin rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta). We have also previously 
demonstrated that compared with agonists of other TLRs, TLR8 agonists induce 
robust production of TNF and IL-1β in whole blood of neonatal and infant rhesus 
macaques assayed in vitro (15). Most studies to date investigating immunogenicity of PCVs in human 
or NHP neonates have employed half of the recommended human infant dose (24, 25, 27). Therefore, 4 
cohorts of 5 rhesus macaques per cohort (Table 1) were immunized i.m. with saline (control), 3M-052 adju-
vant alone (0.1 mg/kg 3M-052, or 40 μg per animal), a half dose of PCV13 alone, or a half dose of PCV13 
admixed with 3M-052 PCV13 + 0.1 mg/kg 3M-052. All treatments began with a birth dose (DOL0), fol-
lowed by booster doses at 1 (DOL28) and 2 months (DOL56) of life (Figure 3A). Peripheral blood was 
collected at the indicated time points to obtain plasma for an assay of antipneumococcal serotype Ab titers 
by polysaccharide-IgG binding microarray (Supplemental Table 2).
After a single immunization, PCV13 alone failed to induce antipneumococcal serotype Ab responses 
above 0.35 μg/ml (Figure 3B), the WHO’s reference IgG Ab concentration that is a correlate of protec-
tion in humans (28). In marked contrast, PCV13 adjuvanted with 3M-052 dramatically induced robust 
Ab responses as early as DOL28 (Figure 3B). Remarkably, a single dose at birth of PCV13 + 0.1 mg/kg 
3M-052 induced pneumococcal polysaccharide–specific (PnPS-specific) IgG responses that were approxi-
mately 10–100 times greater than a single dose at birth of PCV13 alone (Figure 3B and Figure 4). These Ab 
responses significantly surpassed the WHO-recommended minimal protective Ab concentrations (0.35 μg/
ml) for 7 serotypes (Figure 4A) and 6 serotypes as compared with PCV13 alone (Figure 4B).
In vivo adjuvanticity of  3M-052 is dose dependent. Next, we evaluated the PD immunogenicity range of 
3M-052 by repeating our immunization schedule, but with a 10-fold reduced dose. Two additional cohorts 
of 3 rhesus macaques per cohort were immunized i.m. with the lower dose of 3M-052 adjuvant alone (0.01 
mg/kg 3M-052, or 4 μg per animal) or PCV13 admixed with the lower dose of 3M-052 (PCV13 + 0.01 
mg/kg 3M-052). As before, all treatments began with a birth dose (DOL0), followed by booster doses at 1 
(DOL28) and 2 months (DOL56) of life and peripheral blood collection for downstream analysis (Supple-
mental Table 2). DOL28 Ab responses to PCV13 adjuvanted with the lower dose of 3M-052 significant-
ly surpassed the WHO-recommended minimal protective Ab concentrations (0.35 μg/ml) for serotype 3 
(Figure 4A) and serotypes 3, 7F, and 9V as compared with PCV13 alone (Figure 4B). Subsequent boosting 
immunizations on the second and third months enhanced the Ab responses in all groups receiving PCV13. 
However, while PCV13 + 0.01 mg/kg 3M-052 showed significantly enhanced responses to serotypes 6A, 
6B, and 19A, only the PCV13 + 0.1 mg/kg 3M-052 group demonstrated significantly elevated anti-PnPs 
Ab responses to all 13 serotypes by DOL120 (Figure 4A and Supplemental Figure 7), demonstrating that 
TLR7/8A adjuvant dosage can be used to determine a therapeutic window of enhanced immunogenicity.
TLR7/8A adjuvantation dramatically accelerates and enhances serotype-specific pneumococcal opsonophagocyt-
ic killing. To further characterize humoral immunity to the vaccine formulation, DOL0, DOL28, DOL56, 
and DOL120 sera from neonatal and infant rhesus macaques immunized with PCV13 alone, PCV13 + 
0.01 mg/kg 3M-052 or PCV13 + 0.1 mg/kg 3M-052 were examined in a pneumococcal opsonophagocy-
tosis assay. As expected, all rhesus macaque serum samples had no opsonic activity toward all 13 pneu-
mococcal serotypes evaluated at birth (Table 2 and Supplemental Figure 8), with a single outlier animal 
having a slightly increased baseline over undetectable levels for serotype 18C. All PCV13 + 0.1 mg/kg 
3M-052–immunized rhesus macaques demonstrated functional Ab responses to all 13 PS serotypes con-
tained in PCV13. Consistent with the striking observations seen for PnPS-specific IgG titers, functional 
Ab-mediated responses were dramatically accelerated in animals receiving a single dose of (PCV13 + 
3M-052), i.e., PCV13 adjuvanted with either dose of adjuvant. All animals receiving PCV13 + 0.1 mg/
kg 3M-052 demonstrated a robust functional Ab activity to 11 of the 13 serotypes tested by DOL28, with 
opsonization indices approximately 10–100 greater than PCV13 alone (Table 2). In addition, for animals 
receiving PCV13 + 0.1 mg/kg 3M-052, serum opsonophagocytic activity at DOL120 (after immuniza-
tion 3) was 2-fold (for serotypes 4, 14, 1, 5, and 7F), 4-fold (for serotypes 18C and 6A), or 10-fold (for

serotypes 6B, 9V, 19F, 23F, and 19A) greater than that of animals receiving PCV13 alone (Supplemen-
tal Figures 8 and 9). Opsonophagocytic killing activity correlated with accelerated serotype-specific Ab 
responses to (PCV13 + 3M-052) (Supplemental Figure 10–12).
3M-052 has limited systemic activity in neonatal and infant primates. Our study included assessments of the 
general health of enrolled animals as well as detailed monitoring for potential local and systemic reacto-
genicity. During the entire study period through DOL360, no serious adverse effects (29) were observed 
in any of the enrolled animals. Weight curves were documented throughout the course of the study, as 
weight is a sensitive indicator of infant well-being. Weight gains were similar in all treatment groups (Sup-
plemental Figure 13A). Similarly, fever was not reported up to DOL150 in all treatment groups, with the 
only significantly minor change in body temperature (a 0.8°C increase [n = 5, P = 0.05]) observed in the 
PCV13 + 0.1 mg/kg 3M-052 treatment group 48 hours after the third immunization (Supplemental Figure

3M-052)–treated infant animals presented with a transient and mild maculopapular rash. Complete blood 
counts are shown in Supplemental Table 3. When present, erythema (redness) at the site of injection was 
localized and mild to moderate. For the second immunization, the diameter of injection site erythema at 
48 hours after i.m. injection was significantly greater in the (PCV13 + 3M-052) treatment groups (P = 0.05; 
Supplemental Figure 14, A and B) but not significant for any of the other treatment conditions or time 
points evaluated to DOL63. In all animals with localized erythema, this erythema resolved fully with no 
visible sequelae. In line with our murine studies, and in accordance with its chemical design as a hydropho-
bic/locally acting adjuvant, 3M-052 administration with or without PCV13 did not induce systemic cyto-
kine induction in neonatal/infant rhesus macaques over the first 63 days of life (Supplemental Figure 15A) 
or 48 hours after a single dose of PCV13 + 0.01 mg/kg 3M-052 (DOL30) (Supplemental Figure 15, B–D).
Unlike PCV13, (PCV13 + 3M-052) markedly enhanced Th1 CRM-197–specific neonatal CD4+ cells. A meth-
odology for the evaluation of vaccine-specific B and T lymphocytes from peripheral blood was developed 
for this study, driven by the fact that only limited volumes of blood can be obtained from infant macaques. 
Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were sorted to obtain highly pure populations of B 
cells, T cells, and monocytes that were used for the evaluation of antigen-specific vaccine-induced B and 
T cells in infant rhesus macaques by means of enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) and intracellular 
cytokine staining assays, respectively. Cryopreserved PBMCs obtained at DOL28, DOL56, and DOL90 
were used for restimulation in vitro, as outlined in Supplemental Figure 16. Autologous monocytes were 
differentiated to monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs), and after treatment of MoDCs with CRM197 
(the protein component of PCV13), cells were cocultured with neonatal and infant CD4+ T cells for 10 
days (Supplemental Figure 16A). CRM197-specific CD4+ T cells were quantified to determine the pro-
portion of memory cells producing IL-4, IL-17, or IFN-γ (Figure 5, A–C). We observed similar num-
bers of CRM197-specific IL-17 memory CD4+ T cells, associated with reduced pneumococcal carriage, in 
response to PCV13 and PCV13 + 0.1 mg/kg 3M-052 (Figure 5, B and D). Remarkably, by DOL28, animals 
that received PCV13 + 0.1 mg/kg 3M-052 at birth had significantly higher proportions of CRM197-specific 
memory CD4+ T cells producing IFN-γ than those who received PCV13 alone (~0.61% vs. ~0.08%, P = 
0.04) (Figure 5C). Indeed, the IL-17+/IL-4+/IFN-γ+ ratio in the (PCV13 + 3M-052) group was approxi-
mately 1:0.82:1.49 vs. approximately 1:0.65:0.27 for PCV13 (Figure 5D). We also observed a significant 
response for DOL56 (~1.01% vs. ~0.01%, ratio ~1:0.40:2.33 vs. ~1:0.14:0.02, P = 0.018), and a similar 
trend for DOL90 (~0.33% vs. ~0.11%, ratio ~1:0.25:0.50 vs. ~1:0.9:7.81, P = 0.08) (Figure 5, C and D).

significantly enhanced frequencies of PnPs-specific 
CD20+CD27– naive B cells (Figure 6A and Supplemental 
Figure 16B) and CD20+CD27+ memory B cells (Figure 6B) 
on DOL56 and DOL90. Of note, the switch from naive 
to a memory phenotype occurred much earlier in life for 
the (PCV13 + 3M-052)–immunized animals (DOL28) 
than for the PCV13 alone group (DOL56). In fact, DOL28 
PnPs-specific memory cells were significantly elevated in 
the (PCV13 + 3M-052) treatment group and significant-
ly lower for PCV13 alone (Figure 6C). Both the quantity 
and quality (avidity) of 4, 6B, 14, and 23F serotype-spe-
cific (Supplemental Figure 17, A and B) and total (Sup-
plemental Figure 17C) anti–S. pneumoniae capsular poly-
saccharide Abs by ELISA and electrochemiluminescence 
support these observations. These data not only confirm 
the earlier increase in PnPs-specific Ab titer in the (PCV13 
+ 3M-052) treatment groups, but also demonstrate a trend 
of increased Ab avidity, which, together with an earlier 
switch in B cell memory phenotype observed by ELISPOT, 
indicates that 3M-052 accelerated and enhanced B cell 
activation (Supplemental Figure 17D). Indeed, addition 
of 3M-052 to PCV13 was associated with increased infil-
tration of CD68+ cells (i.e., monocytes/macrophages) into 
the injection site muscle (Supplemental Figure 18).
Discussion
Until the end of the 20th century, vaccine adjuvantation 
was largely limited to the use of alum (30). Over the past 
20 years there has been explosive growth of information 
regarding PRRs that can activate leukocytes and thereby enhance immune responses. In parallel, a growing 
menu of adjuvants is now becoming available to immunologists and vaccinologists (31). Newborns and 
young infants demonstrate distinct immune responses, are at the greatest risk of infection of any age group, 
and receive most vaccines; yet to date, adjuvanted vaccine development programs have usually not system-
atically selected or optimized adjuvants for use in early life. Therefore, many vaccine formulations produce 
distinct and potentially suboptimal responses in the very young. A number of adjuvanted, including live 
(self-adjuvanted), vaccines induce relatively robust immunogenicity in early life: (a) in mice, measles vac-
cines employing DNA (32) and a live-replicating attenuated strain of Listeria monocytogenes (33) induced 
early protection; (b) in infant rhesus macaques, liposome adjuvant/replicon particles induce anti-measles 
immunity (34); and (c) in human newborns, Bacille Calmette Guérin, a live-attenuated Mycobacterium bovis 
vaccine that activates multiple PRRs induces robust Th1 responses at birth (35). However, to our knowl-
edge, a molecular adjuvant that can help induce adult-level immunogenicity/protection in newborn pri-
mates had yet to be described.

An increased appreciation of immune ontogeny may inform future research and design of age-specific 
vaccine formulations. Accordingly, and as neither rodent models nor adult human leukocytes accurately 
model human newborn and infant responses (1), we focused on a candidate early life TLR7/8 adjuvanta-
tion system that was active toward human newborn leukocytes in vitro coupled with in vivo evaluation in 
an animal species (Macaca mulatta) that expresses TLR8 that is structurally and functionally similar to its 
human counterpart (15). In vitro modeling identified 3M-052 as a lipidated TLR7/8A adjuvant that both 
alone and in synergy with alum induced Th1 cytokine responses at birth and that when administered with 
alum-adjuvanted PCV13 in vivo dramatically accelerated and enhanced neonatal antigen-specific immuno-

genicity after a single immunization. Moreover, 3M-052 synergistically enhanced type II IFN and Th1-po-
larizing human cord blood cytokine production in response to PCV13 in vitro and dramatically accelerat-
ed S. pneumoniae antigen-specific neonatal rhesus macaque B and Th1 cell responses ex vivo. The ability 
of 3M-052 to enhance and accelerate activation of anti–PnPs-IgG (PnPS-specific) B cells, Th1-polarized 
CRM197-specific CD4+ T cells, and synergistically activated type II IFN responses in vitro shares similarity 
with the immune-polarizing effects of systemic viral infection (36) and signatures of bacterial viability (37), 
highlighting the potential of TLR7/8-triggered pathways to fundamentally shape immune responses (38, 
39), especially vaccinal antigen-specific IFN-γ–producing T cells in early life (10). In light of the ability 
of 3M-052 to prime at a high dose (0.1 mg/kg) and boost at a lower dose (0.01 mg/kg), it is possible that 
(PCV13 + 3M-052) may enhance induction of extrafollicular B cell responses (40). Indeed, we speculate 
that vaccine adjuvantation with agonists of TLR7/8, PRRs key to detecting microbial RNAs, may induce 
a response that more closely resembles natural infection, with live pneumococci inducing Th1/Th17-po-
larized cell-mediated immunity (41) and supporting Tfh cell differentiation circumventing the neonatal 
inhibitory milieu and T cell–intrinsic factors and thereby enabling early life germinal center B cell responses 
(42). We hypothesize that the trend toward reduced numbers of blood circulating CRM197-specific IL-17 
memory CD4+ T cells at day 90 in the (PCV13 + 3M-052) immunized animals may reflect migration of 
pneumococcal-specific IL-17 cells to mucosal sites where they may play roles in reducing pneumococcal 
carriage (43). Of note, 3M-052 + PCV13 expanded atypical PnPS-specific CD27– B cells, also known as 
“naive-mature B cells,” thought to represent direct precursors to multiple phenotypically distinct memory B 
cells, including germinal center–dependent Ab-secreting memory B cells with relatively high proliferation 
and somatic hypermutation (44). As 3M-052 is a dual TLR7/8A, direct activation of naive B cells through 
TLR7 may also contribute to the observed effects of this adjuvant (45).
A key concern regarding adjuvanted vaccine development is reactogenicity, the propensity of a formu-
lation to cause acute inflammatory events either locally (e.g., erythema, tenderness) or systemically as fever. 
Of note, vaccine adjuvants are not licensed separately; rather, the adjuvant is a constituent of the licensed 
vaccine formulation. Therefore, as demonstrated in our assays, adjuvants must be evaluated both alone and 
as a component of a vaccine formulation. To the extent that they reflect activity in vivo, development of 
reliable platforms for in vitro modeling may help exclude adjuvants with high potential to induce unaccept-
able reactogenicity in the very young (1, 4). Through our adjuvantation approach, not only was the system-

ducing rhesus naive and memory B cell quantification. Higher frequencies of PnPS-specific B cells were noted in the (PCV13 + 3M-052) animals vs. the 
PCV13 group (n = 3–4). (C) Coadministration of 3M-052 with PCV13 to newborn rhesus macaques dramatically accelerated the transition of anti-PnPS B 
cells from naive to memory phenotype. Antipneumococcal polysaccharide (PnPS) IgG-producing naive (CD27–) and memory (CD27+) B cells were measured 
by flow cytometry. At day of life 28 (DOL28), the switch from naive to memory phenotype occurred earlier in (PCV13 + 3M-052)– vs. PCV13 only–immunized 
animals. Nonspecific polysaccharide in vitro activation in the control conditions (i.e., saline or 3M-052 alone) or specific CRM-197 treatment of B cells from 
all treatment groups never exceeded approximately 1.0%. For comparison at individual time points, the unpaired Mann-Whitney test was applied, *P < 
0.05, **P < 0.01. Results represent mean ± SEM (n = 4 per group).

ic inflammation associated with TLR7/8 stimulation reduced, but adjuvant efficacy was also maintained in 
newborns. Thus, we demonstrate that a rationally designed adjuvanted vaccine approach taking both age 
and species specificity into account could enable effective early life immunization.
Even though our study breaks ground in the area of early life immunization, as with any research effort, it 
has some limitations. Although NHPs are a helpful model, vaccine-induced reactogenicity and efficacy in infant 
NHPs can diverge from those observed in human infants (46). In addition, as 3M-052 likely exerts its adjuvant 
effects at local sites of injection (not the systemic bloodstream), our knowledge of it’s PD (i.e., the concentration 
required to achieve an adjuvant effect) is limited by the fact that (a) our in vitro whole blood assay system may 
not reflect the concentration needed at the injection site (e.g., i.m.) and (b) in vivo drug concentration data are 
often based on sampling the bloodstream and not the likely site of adjuvant action. Although the higher con-
centration in cord blood of monocytes, the major producers of TLR-mediated TNF in blood, may contribute 
to robust 3M-052 activation of newborn blood, we have previously demonstrated that agonists of other TLRs 
do not activate robust Th1 cytokines from newborn blood (16). Moreover, direct comparison of purified human 
newborn and adult monocytes at equal concentrations demonstrates a similar pattern of substantially greater 
responses to TLR8As that are refractory to inhibitory neonatal adenosine pathways (15–17).
The persistently high global burden of infections in the very young (47) provides a compelling rationale 
for developing additional safe and effective early life vaccines. Overall, four key aspects of our findings 
deserve particular emphasis: (a) human in vitro systems may be able to predict age-specific adjuvantici-
ty, (b) chemical modification of adjuvants can help limit systemic reactogenicity, (c) newborn primates 
are not inherently incapable of robust immune responses at birth but can mount robust Th1 and Th2 
cell and humoral responses when stimulated with an appropriately adjuvanted vaccine formulation, and 
(d) TLR7/8As, such as 3M-052, may offer substantial advantages for adjuvantation of PCV13 and other 
vaccines. To our knowledge, ours is the first report of employing medicinal chemistry and human in vitro 
modeling for development of a locally targeted, age-specific adjuvanted neonatal vaccine formulation with 
robust in vivo activity at birth, a key point of healthcare contact (18). Another translational feature of our 
approach is that it builds upon a traditional alum-adjuvanted vaccine formulation, providing a potentially 
practical path to modify common pediatric conjugate vaccines for greater efficacy. Overall, study of indi-
vidual and combined adjuvantation systems with activity toward specific age groups may open new paths 
to develop adjuvanted vaccines for distinct vulnerable populations, such as the young and elderly. Prior to 
human clinical trials, further evaluation and optimization of this adjuvant approach, including potential 
dose-sparing effects, reactogenicity, safety, and efficacy, are warranted.
Methods
In vivo rodent vaccination studies. To evaluate drug PK (serum drug levels) and PD (serum TNF), female 
crl:CD(SD) rats (~350–400 g) (Charles River Laboratories) received a single s.c. (scruff of neck) or 
two i.m. (quadriceps) administrations of 3M-052 or R848 formulated in O/W emulsion (vehicle). Rat 
serum was collected 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 24 hours after dose. 3M-052 and 
R848 serum drug levels were determined by LC-MS/MS before or after dose, with a lower limit of 
quantification (LLQ) of 0.84 and 3.2 pmol/ml, respectively. Similarly, serum TNF concentrations were 
measured by ELISA at the indicated times before or after dose, with a LLQ of 31 pg/ml. To determine 
systemic cytokine response and IFN-inducible gene expression following free or lipidated TLR7/8 
IMQ administration, 6- to 8-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory), weighing 
approximately 18 g each, were administered a single s.c. dose of 3M-052 or R848 formulated (both 1 
mg/kg, 20 μg/mouse) in O/W emulsion (vehicle). After administration, whole blood was collected 1, 
3, 6, 9, 18, and 24 hours after dose, while draining lymph nodes (brachial and axillary) and spleen were 
collected 1, 3, 6, and 18 hours after dose. TNF, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, and CCL2 serum cytokine kinetics 
were evaluated by flow cytometry cytometric bead array (BD Biosciences). mRNA expression in drain-
ing lymph nodes and spleen after administration were determined by quantitative RT-PCR (Applied 
Biosystems), as described previously (11) and represented as relative fold-change expression (i.e., treat-
ment relative expression/naive relative expression). For rodent studies, 6- to 8-week-old male BALB/c 
mice were immunized by s.c. injection (scruff of neck) with recombinant influenza A hemagglutinin 
(10 μg) alone or in combination with 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, or 1 mg/kg 3M-052 or in combination with 
alum, 3 times (prime, boost, boost), 14 days apart. Hemagglutinin-specific serum Ig levels were mea-
sured by ELISA on day 77, 21 days after final immunization (11).

Human blood sample processing and in vitro stimulation. Peripheral blood was collected from healthy adult 
volunteers, while human newborn cord blood was collected immediately after Cesarean section delivery of 
the placenta. Births to known HIV-positive mothers were excluded. Human blood was anticoagulated with 
20 units/ml pyrogen-free sodium heparin (American Pharmaceutical Partners Inc.). All blood products were 
kept at room temperature and processed within 4 hours from collection. Human whole blood assays were 
completed as previously described (48). Briefly, neonatal cord blood or adult whole blood was mixed 1:1 with 
sterile prewarmed (37°C) RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), and 180–225 μl of the 1:1 suspension was added 
to each well of a 96-well U-bottom plate (Becton Dickinson) containing 20–25 μl freshly prepared specific 
TLRAs at 10 times the final concentration. Suspensions containing 200–250 μl/well were gently mixed by 
pipetting and incubated for 6 hours at 37°C in a humidified incubator at 5%, CO2. After culture, plates were 
centrifuged at 500 g, and approximately 100–150 μl supernatant was carefully removed by pipetting without 
disturbing the cell pellet. Supernatants derived from human leukocyte stimulations were assayed by ELISA 
for TNF (BD Biosciences) and IL-1β (eBiosciences). Additionally, whole blood assay supernatants were ana-
lyzed by multiplex cytokine assays (Millipore). The minimum threshold for each analyte was set at the mini-
mum detectable concentration for a given assay, defined as 3 standard deviations above the mean background.
TLRAs and multianalyte assays. R848 (TLR7/8) was purchased from InvivoGen. All TLR7/8As and 
emulsions used in both in vitro and in vivo studies were verified to be free of endotoxin (<1 EU/ml) by 
the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay per the manufacturer’s instructions (Charles River Laboratories). Cyto-
kine and chemokine expression profiles in cell culture supernatants and peripheral blood plasma were 
measured using customized Milliplex human and NHP cytokine/chemokine magnetic bead panels (Milli-
pore), respectively. Assays were analyzed on the Luminex 100/200 System employing xPOTENT software 
(Luminex) and Millipore Milliplex Analyst (version 3.5.5.0).
Vaccine formulation. The point-of-use mixed vaccine formulation consisted of 2 components. The 
first component consisted of an O/W emulsion, made up of a pH 6 citrate buffer, soybean oil, and 
surfactants that contains 0.04–0.4 mg/ml of N-[4- [(4-amino-2-butyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-1-yl)
oxy]butyl]octadecanamide (3M-052) (11) (3M Drug Delivery Systems Division, 3M Center). Concen-
trations of 3M-052 O/W emulsion preparations were confirmed by high-performance liquid chroma-
tography (HPLC). The 3M-052 O/W emulsion formulations were sterile filtered, aliquoted into sterile 
2-ml serum vials sealed with rubber septa, and stored at 2°C–8°C until use. Dual agonist activity of 
3M-052 was confirmed using HEK293 cells stably expressing either human TLR7 or TLR8 (11). The 
dosing range of 3M-052 was approximately 4–40 μg (0.01–0.1 mg/kg; 400 g birth weight) (Supplemen-
tal Table 1). The second component consisted of one-half of the recommended human infant dose of 
the Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine (Diphtheria CRM197 Protein) (Pfizer), which included 
the 13 pneumococcal conjugates (serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F). 
Each PCV13-containing administration totaled 1.1 μg per dose of saccharide per serotype, except for 
serotype 6B, which totaled 2.2 μg per dose. Each of the polysaccharides was conjugated separately to 
CRM197 and adsorbed on aluminum phosphate (0.0625 mg aluminum). Sodium chloride, succinic 
acid, polysorbate 80, and water for injection were also included in PCV13. Where possible, components 
were verified to be free of endotoxin (<1 EU/ml), as measured by the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay per 
the manufacturer’s instructions (Charles River Laboratories).
For the injection of animals, all preparations were made within 1 hour of planned injection using sterile 
techniques. Briefly, a premade PCV13 vial was gently mixed by hand several times. The total volume (500 μl) 
of the PCV13 vial was sterilely injected into the prealiquoted adjuvant vials containing 3M-052 adjuvant O/W 
emulsion (making a combined total volume of 700 μl). The combined (PCV13 + 3M-052) vial was then vortexed 
for 20 to 30 seconds. Using a 1 ml pyrogen-free syringe 22- to 25-gauge needle, 350 μl of the formulation was 
removed and injected i.m. into the quadriceps muscle. The vial containing the remaining 350 μl of the formula-
tion was discarded. Both the adjuvant alone and half recommended human infant dose of PCV13 alone were 
treated similarly, replacing equal volumes of saline for O/W emulsion. 0.35 ml clinical-grade saline (sterile/
pyrogen-free 0.9% NaCl solution for injection) was used as a placebo control. Oil droplet particle size was deter-
mined by dynamic light scattering using a Zetasizer nanoseries instrument (Malvern Nano-ZS, l 1⁄4 532 nm) as 
previously described (49). The particle size data refer to scattering intensity distributions (z-average) with accom-
panying polydispersity/heterogeneity index (PDI), with a PDI < 0.2 considered monodisperse.
Selection of  rhesus macaque model. Murine TLR8 is divergent from human and monkey TLR8, and mice

animal model for predicting TLR8 adjuvant responses in human infants (27, 51). To date, 10 TLR/TIR 
orthologs have been identified within the rhesus macaque (M. mulata) genome, with an overall mean amino 
acid identity of 96.7% to their corresponding human TLR/TIR sequences, compared with 87.4% to mouse 
TLR/TIR sequences (26). The most highly conserved TLR/TIR is TLR8, which demonstrates 98.6% ami-
no acid identity to human TLR8. Moreover, TLR8 in rhesus macaques and humans is highly conserved 
in terms of its predicted distribution pattern of extracellular LRRs. Rhesus macaques are also well suited 
for our study because: (a) adult rhesus macaques have demonstrated human-like responses to TLR7/8As 
in vivo (52–54), (b) both infant and adult rhesus macaques demonstrate human-like TLR7/8A-induced 
cytokine responses in vitro (15), and (c) like humans, infant rhesus macaques respond immunologically to 
conjugated but not to unconjugated polysaccharides in vivo.
In vivo neonatal and infant rhesus macaque vaccination studies. Rhesus macaques were obtained from the 
TNPRC specific pathogen–free breeding colony. Upon identification, pregnant dams were transferred to an 
indoor social group to allow for monitoring and delivery of infants. At birth, neonatal rhesus macaques (<24 
hours of age) were enrolled into the longitudinal immunization study. Exclusion criteria were (a) maternal 
fever (≥40°C) during infant exam on DOL0, (b) birth weight <400g, (c) clinical signs of neonatal infection 
(e.g., infant temperature ≥36.5°C; nasal, ocular discharge; respiratory distress; cardiovascular instability), 
(d) congenital defects (e.g., abnormal digits, omphalocele), and/or (e) abnormal cling. Animals were group 
housed in dam/infant pairs with a maximum of 4 pairs (8 animals) together. All animals received standard 
environmental enrichment, including manipulanda in the cage, perches/swings, various food supplements, 
foraging or task-oriented feeding methods, and regular human interaction with caretakers. Animals were 
assigned to either the phlebotomy group or the biopsy/phlebotomy group in a predesigned random sequential 
order (Supplemental Table 2). As a per-protocol analysis method was employed, one enrolled animal that 
died of natural causes unrelated to the study treatments within 24 hours of birth was not included in the final 
analysis. A standardized procedure for tattooing; physical exam; assessment of local reactogenicity, including 
photographic documentation; and immunization of neonatal and infant rhesus macaques was employed. 
Briefly, on the day of immunization (DOL0, DOL28, and DOL56), the leg designated to receive treatment 
was clipped to remove hair and a tattoo was applied (at birth only) on the thorax. Standard physiological safe-
ty parameters, extrapolated from human infant clinical trials of PCV13 (29), included temperature and weight 
(normalized to TNPRC reference standard for rhesus macaques), which were recorded at multiple time points 
at observation/sample acquisition, as well as local signs of reactogenicity, such as leg circumference before/
after immunization and photographic documentation of erythema (Supplemental Table 2). A standardized 
physical exam and assessment of local reactogenicity, including photographic documentation, were repeated 
48 hours after immunization through DOL70, according to the schedule in Supplemental Table 2. For photog-
raphy, animals were positioned in a standardized way and 9 sequential photographs obtained. These included 
photograph 1, the tattoo number (to avoid false attribution of pictures to animals); photograph 2, both ventral 
thighs; photographs 3 and 4, each ventral thigh individually; and photographs 5–8: each thigh individually 
from medial and lateral aspects. If local erythema (redness) or swelling were noted, a higher magnification 
photograph was taken of the area. Finally, the newborn underwent i.m. vaccination as outlined above. After 
DOL70, physical exam alone (i.e., without photography) was conducted according to the same schedule, up 
to 1 year of life. For biopsy samples, animals were anesthetized via i.m. ketamine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) 
and dexmedetomidine (7.5–15 μg/kg i.m.) or i.m. tiletimine/zolazepam (8 mg/kg). i.m. buprenorphine (0.01 
mg/kg) was also administered for analgesia when indicated, and atipamezole was administered i.m. as a 
reversal agent when dexmedetomidine was used. The cranial aspect of the rear limb distal to the coxofemoral 
joint and proximal to the stifle were surgically prepped, a sterile fenestrated drape was placed on the cranial 
aspect of the rear limb, and a no. 15 scalpel blade was used to make a 3-mm incision through the skin. Skin 
adjacent to the incision was undermined, and muscle tissue was exteriorized using sterile rat tooth forceps. 
Curved scissors were used to excise a 2-mm length of superficial musculature. Once completed, sterile gauze 
was placed over the skin incision if hemorrhage occurred. Finally, the skin incision was closed with a single 
interrupted suture or skin glue. The 2-mm cube muscle biopsies were obtained from the injection site (quadri-
ceps muscle) prior to and 48 hours after each immunization (one in each thigh) and obtained in an alternating 
pattern (e.g., DOL0 left leg, DOL2 right leg, DOL30 left leg, DOL58 right leg). Lymph node biopsies were 
obtained on DOL7 and 63 and followed a similar pattern of alternation. Peripheral blood samples were 
drawn from each group at multiple time points, per Supplemental Table 2, including at DOL0 (preimmuni-
zation), DOL7, DOL28, DOL30, DOL35, DOL56, DOL63, DOL90, DOL150, DOL180, DOL240, and

DOL360. Serum and plasma samples were stored at –80°C for subsequent immunogenicity assays. PBMCs 
were isolated and stored in liquid nitrogen. For select peripheral blood samples, standard hematology, serum 
chemistry, and urinalysis assays were conducted at the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–certi-
fied Department of Laboratory Medicine, Boston Children’s Hospital. Biomarkers evaluated included serum 
chemistry (electrolytes, creatinine, ALT, and AST to monitor for renal or hepatic damage). Macroscopic and 
microscopic urinalysis were employed to assess possible renal damage and/or inflammation. Complete blood 
counts (to detect dyscrasias) were measured at TNPRC within 2 hours of phlebotomy.
Multiplexing electrochemiluminescence and opsonophagocytosis assays. Ab response in infant monkey sera 
was measured in a 96-well electrochemiluminescence multiplex assay employing Meso Scale Discovery 
(MSD) technology, as previously described (55, 56). Two 10-spot (per single microtiter well) 96-well plates 
were used to monitor Ab responses to all 13 pneumococcal serotypes. PnPSs were obtained from ATCC 
or Statens Serum Institut (SSI) for Danish serotype designations 3, 4, 6B, 9V
, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F. These 
were individually spotted in each well (100 μg/ml coating concentration, 5 ng/spot for all types) on one 
plate, while polysaccharides 1, 5, 6A, 7F, 19A, 22F, and 33F were individually spotted in each well on the 
second plate. Before addition to the plate, primate serum samples were combined with an absorbent con-
taining C-polysaccharide (C-PS), 25A, and 45 capsular PS (from SSI) to neutralize Ab binding to C-PS and 
other common contaminants present in the PnPS-coating antigens. A Sulfo-tag–labeled goat anti-human 
IgG that emits light upon electrochemical stimulation was used as a secondary Ab. The total IgG concen-
tration in rhesus serum was calculated with MSD Workbench v. 3 software using the human antipneumo-
coccal reference serum, lot 89SF-2 (Lederle-Praxis Biologicals) (56), and 007SP (57), as controls. Pneu-
mococcal opsonophagocytosis assays were conducted at the Laboratory of Moon Nahm (University of 
Alabama; Birmingham, Alabama, USA). The multiplexed opsonophagocytic killing assay, MOPA4, was 
used to test the infant rhesus macaque sera, as previously described (58, 59). Opsonization titers were 
defined as the serum dilution that kills 50% of bacteria. The lowest detectable titer in the MOPA was 24, 
and therefore, samples identified as negative in the assay (i.e., samples having no functional activity detect-
ed) were assigned a titer of 12 (i.e., half the lowest limit of detection).
Characterization of  PnPS-specific B cells. Rhesus macaque PBMCs were labeled with anti-CD14-PE (clone 
M5E2), CD20-V450 (clone L27), CD27-PE.Cy7 (clone M-T271), CD4-FITC (clone SK3) Abs (BD Bioscienc-
es). CD14+ monocytes, CD20+CD27– naive B cells, CD20+CD27+ memory B cells, and CD4+ Th cells were sort-
ed with a FACSAria II cell sorter. Antipneumococcal B cells in peripheral blood were enumerated in sorted B 
cell populations. Sorted B cell populations were cultured at a concentration of 5 × 106/ml for 5 days at 37°C, 5% 
CO2, in RPMI media supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 1 μg/ml R848 (Invivo-
gen), 10 IU/ml IL-2 (R&D Systems), and 8,000 U/ml IFN-α (Abcam). ELISpot plates (Millipore) were coated 
either with a combination of 10 μg/ml anti-rhesus IgG-Fc and anti-rhesus IgM-Fc (Nordic Immunological Lab-
oratories) in PBS or with a 10 μg/ml pool of the following PnPSs: Danish designations 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 9V
, 14, 
18C, 19A, and 23F (ATCC) as well as 7F and 19F (SSI) in PBS. Plates were coated overnight at 4°C and blocked 
with RPMI 1640/10% FBS for 1 hour prior to plating of cells. After 5 days of culture, B cells were incubated 
for 16 hours on the coated and blocked ELISpot plate in RPMI supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin 
and 10% FBS. Unless indicated otherwise, 10% of each culture (~50,000 cells) was plated in anti-rhesus IgG/
IgM-coated wells and 90% of each culture (~450,000 cells) was plated in wells coated with polysaccharides. 
Secreted immunoglobulins were detected using horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat anti-rhesus immuno-
globulin (Nordic Immunological Laboratories). Spots were developed using 3,3’,5,5’-Tetramethylbenzidine 
(TMB) (Mabtech) and visualized and counted using a series 5 ELISpot analyzer (Cellular Technology Limited). 
The fraction of PnPS-specific B cells was quantified as the ratio of the spots detected in polysaccharide-coated 
wells to spots detected in immunoglobulin-coated wells after correction for dilution.
Characterization of  CRM197-specific CD4+ T cells. Monocytes and T cells were sorted as described above. 
Sorted CD4+ T cells were nonspecifically maintained by culturing in RPMI 1640 media supplemented 
with penicillin/streptomycin, 10% fetal bovine albumin, and 100 ng/ml Concanavalin A (Sigma-Aldrich) 
during the generation of MoDCs from sorted monocytes. Monocytes were cultured at a concentration of 
0.75 × 106/ml to 1 × 106/ml for 5 days in RPMI supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, 10% FBS, 
100 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and 50 ng IL-4 (R&D Systems). On day 5, 
MoDCs were harvested and incubated in the absence or presence of 5 μg/ml CRM197 (Sigma-Aldrich) 
for 5 hours in RPMI without FBS. After 5 hours, FBS was added to 10% (v/v), and 100 ng/ml lipopoly-
saccharide (ultrapure from List Biological Laboratories) was added for an additional 18 hours. MoDCs

were subsequently harvested, washed, and cocultured at 5,000 cells per well with 50,000 T cells for 7 days. 
On day 7, cells producing IFN-γ, IL-4, or IL-17 were analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining after the 
addition of BD Golgi-plug (BD Biosciences) during the final 6 hours of culture. T cells were made perme-
able with Cytofix/Cytoperm reagents (BD Biosciences). Cells were stained with anti–IFN-γ-PE.Cy7 (clone 
B27, BD Biosciences), anti–IL-17-APC (clone 41802, R&D Systems), and anti–IL-4-V450 (clone 8D4-8, 
BD Biosciences). Cells were analyzed for production of these 3 cytokines by flow cytometry (LSRFortessa 
flow cytometer, Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with Flowjo software version 10 (Tree Star Inc.).
ELISAs. Quantitation of total S. pneumoniae and capsular polysaccharides serotype 4-, 6B-, 14-, and 
23F-specific IgG were determined by use of an adapted WHO-recommended ELISA protocol, as outlined 
by the Bacterial Respiratory Pathogen Reference Laboratory at the University of Alabama at Birmingham 
(60). Serum Ab concentrations were calculated by comparing the optical density of each unknown well at 
405 nm and 690 nm (reference) and to the optical density of the standard (human antipneumococcal ref-
erence serum, lot 89-SF). For avidity determination, assessment of the overall strength of binding between 
Ab and antigen, a 0- to 4-M NaSCN gradient was used to determine the NaSCN concentration that com-
petes off approximately 50% of the bound rhesus immunoglobulins (61).
Statistics. Statistical significance and graphs were generated using Prism v. 5.0b (GraphPad Soft-
ware) and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation). For data analyzed by normalization to control val-
ues (vehicle), column statistics were conducted using the 2-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test or unpaired 
Mann-Whitney test as appropriate. Gaussian sample distributions were assessed by Shapiro-Wilk normal-
ity test. Group comparisons employed 1-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison post-test or 
2-way repeated-measures ANOVA comparing column and row effects. Results were considered significant 
at P < 0.05. Level of synergy was calculated using the Loewe definition of additivity (62), with D > 1 indi-
cating antagonism, D = 1 additivity, and D < 1 synergy.
Study approval. All experiments were conducted in accordance with relevant institutional and national 
guidelines, regulations, and approvals. All rodents were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, and 
studies were approved by the 3M Drug Delivery Systems IACUC. Nonidentifiable human cord blood sam-
ples were collected with approval from the Ethics Committees of Brigham and Women’s Hospital (protocol 
2000-P-000117) and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA (protocol 2011P-
000118). Blood samples from adult volunteers were collected after written informed consent, with approval 
from the Ethics Committee of Boston Children’s Hospital (protocol X07-05-0223). Human experimenta-
tion guidelines of the US Department of Health and Human Services were observed. The longitudinal 
rhesus monkey experimental protocol (P0184) was approved by the IACUC at Tulane University (New 
Orleans, Louisiana, USA) and performed at TNPRC. Additionally, peripheral blood samples from rhesus 
macaques were derived from New England Primate Research Center (Southborough, Massachusetts, USA) 
and used under Harvard University IACUC approval (protocol 04936).
