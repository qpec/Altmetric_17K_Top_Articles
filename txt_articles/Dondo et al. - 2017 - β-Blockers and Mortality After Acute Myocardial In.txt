ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND For acute myocardial infarction (AMI) without heart failure (HF), it is unclear if b-blockers are
associated with reduced mortality.
OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to determine the association between b-blocker use and mortality in patients
with AMI without HF or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD).
METHODS This cohort study used national English and Welsh registry data from the Myocardial Ischaemia National
Audit Project. A total of 179,810 survivors of hospitalization with AMI without HF or LVSD, between January 1, 2007,
and June 30, 2013 (final follow-up: December 31, 2013), were assessed. Survival-time inverse probability weighting
propensity scores and instrumental variable analyses were used to investigate the association between the use of
b-blockers and 1-year mortality.
RESULTS Of 91,895 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and 87,915 patients with non–ST-segment
elevation myocardial infarction, 88,542 (96.4%) and 81,933 (93.2%) received b-blockers, respectively. For the entire
cohort, with >163,772 person-years of observation, there were 9,373 deaths (5.2%). Unadjusted 1-year mortality was lower
for patients who received b-blockers compared with those who did not (4.9% vs. 11.2%; p < 0.001). However, after
weighting and adjustment, there was no significant difference in mortality between those with and without b-blocker use
(average treatment effect [ATE] coefficient: 0.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: �0.60 to 0.75; p ¼ 0.827). Findings were
similar for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (ATE coefficient: 0.30; 95% CI: �0.98 to 1.58; p ¼ 0.637) and
non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (ATE coefficient: �0.07; 95% CI: �0.68 to 0.54; p ¼ 0.819).
CONCLUSIONS Among survivors of hospitalization with AMI who did not have HF or LVSD as recorded in the
hospital, the use of b-blockers was not associated with a lower risk of death at any time point up to 1 year.

istorically, b-blockers have been the stan-
dard
of
care
for
patients
with
acute
myocardial
infarction
(AMI).
However,
clinical uncertainty exists regarding their effective-
ness in reducing mortality among patients with AMI
who do not have heart failure (HF) or left ventricular
systolic dysfunction (LVSD). For example, although
there is sufficient evidence to support the use of
b-blockers in patients with AMI and HF (1,2), as well
as in hospitalized patients who are hemodynamically
stable (3,4), there are no contemporary randomized
data for survivors of AMI without HF or LVSD in rela-
tion to the use of b-blockers. As such, international
guidelines differ in their recommendation regarding
the use of b-blockers after AMI (5–8).
Results from recent observational studies suggest
no
significant
association
between
the
use
of
b-blockers among patients with AMI who do not have
HF or LVSD and clinical outcomes. A meta-analysis
comprising 16,645 patients with preserved left ven-
tricular ejection fraction and who received percuta-
neous coronary intervention (PCI) for AMI found that
the
use
of
b-blockers
was
not
associated
with
improved survival (9). However, recent data for 2,679
patients with AMI without HF or LVSD recorded in the
FAST-MI (French Registry on Acute ST-Elevation and
Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction) study found
that early b-blocker use was associated with reduced
30-day mortality, but their discontinuation at 1 year
was not associated with higher 5-year mortality (10).
To the best of our knowledge, to date, there are no
analyses of large-scale datasets that have investi-
gated the impact of b-blockers on survival after AMI
among patients without HF or LVSD. On one hand,
discontinuing b-blockers in survivors of AMI who do
not have HF may prevent unnecessary overtreatment
and
costs,
and
improve
adherence
to
other
medications. On the other hand, randomized
evidence
to
date
suggests
that
use
of
b-blockers after AMI reduces clinical events
(3,11). The goal of the present study, there-
fore, was to use the United Kingdom national
heart
attack
register,
known
as
MINAP
(Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Proj-
ect), to investigate the impact of the use
of b-blockers on all-cause mortality at 1 year
for survivors of hospitalized AMI without HF
or LVSD.
METHODS
The
analyses
were
based
on
data
from
MINAP, a comprehensive registry of acute
coronary syndrome hospitalizations started
in 2000 and mandated by the United King-
dom’s Department of Health (12). Data were collected
prospectively at each hospital, electronically encryp-
ted, and transferred online to a central database. Each
patient entry offered details of the patient journey,
including
the
method
and
timing
of
admission,
inpatient
investigations,
results
and
treatment,
comorbidities, risk factors, and (if applicable) date of
death from linkage to the United Kingdom’s Office for
National Statistics. Ethical approval was not required
under National Health Service research governance
arrangements. The National Institute for Cardiovas-
cular Outcomes Research, which includes the MINAP
registry (Ref: NIGB: ECC 1-06 [d]/2011), has support
under section 251 of the National Health Service Act
2006 to use patient information for medical research
without consent.
The analytical cohort (N ¼ 179,810) was drawn
from 531,282 patients with AMI admitted to 1 of
247 hospitals between January 1, 2007, and June 30,
2013, with a final follow-up as of December 31,
2013 (Figure 1). Patients were eligible for the study

 if
they
were
admitted
from
2007
onward
and
discharged with a final diagnosis of ST-segment
elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non–ST-
segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
For patients with multiple admissions, the earliest
record was used. We excluded 55,981 (10.5%) patients
who had other final diagnoses; 29,607 (5.6%) who
died in the hospital; 24,984 (4.7%) with missing
mortality data; 237 (0.05%) >100 years of age; 105,447
(19.9%) who had previous AMI, angina, PCI, and/or
coronary artery bypass graft surgery (and, therefore,
may previously have received b-blockers); 57,682
(10.9%)
who
had
a
record
of
previous
use
of
b-blockers; 38,806 (7.3%) with a contraindication to
b-blockers; 5,430 (1.0%) who had a history of HF; and
33,298 (6.3%) who were prescribed a loop diuretic.
For the present study, HF was defined as a history of
HF, use of a loop diuretic on or during hospitaliza-
tion, and/or a left ventricular ejection fraction <30%
as recorded in the hospital. b-blocker use was deter-
mined according to whether eligible patients had
received b-blockers at discharge from the hospital.
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 1 year
after hospitalization.
STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS. Baseline
characteristics
according
to
treatment
with
b-blockers
were
described by using number and percentage for cate-
gorical data and mean � SD or median and inter-
quartile
range
for
normally
and
non-normally
distributed
continuous
data,
respectively.
Differ-
ences
in
characteristics
were
assessed
by
using
chi-square tests, 2-sample Student t tests, and, for
non-normally distributed data, the Mann-Whitney
U test. Adjusted Kaplan-Meier curves were used to
assess survival differences between patients who
received b-blockers and those who did not.
Survival time inverse probability weighting pro-
pensity score analysis (13,14) was used to evaluate
the association between b-blocker use and mortality
by estimating the average treatment effects (ATEs)
and ATEs on the treated. Briefly, the method incorpo-
rated 2 models, the first of which was a treatment
assignment model that estimated the propensity for
b-blocker treatment assignment and was used to
derive
inverse
probability
weights.
This
model
included 24 case-mix variables: sex; socioeconomic
deprivation (Index of Multiple Deprivation score);
year
of
hospital
admission;
cardiovascular
risk
factors (diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hyperten-
sion, smoking status, and family history of coronary
heart
disease);
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease; cerebrovascular disease; peripheral vascular
disease;
discharge
medications
(statins,

mini–Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk
score variables (age, cardiac arrest, elevated enzyme,
systolic blood pressure, heart rate at hospitalization,
and creatinine level); and care by cardiologist. The
second model was a survival model to determine
the treatment effect using the inverse probability
weights from model 1 to balance the covariate distri-
bution between the treatment and control observa-
tions. To further mitigate from residual confounding
in survival modeling, we adjusted for these covariates
as well as cardiac rehabilitation. The second model
was performed twice: first including only cases that
were within 0.1 to 0.9 of the propensity score distri-
bution to conduct a balanced analysis; and second
including all cases regardless of their propensity
score to check the robustness of the balanced analysis
(the Online Appendix presents additional details).
Given
that
propensity
scoring
only
adjusts
for
measured confounding, an instrumental variable anal-
ysis with hospital rates of prescription of guideline-
indicated
treatments
(aspirin,
P2Y12
inhibitors,
b-blockers, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers) as the instru-
ment was used to further assess potential selection
bias (the Online Appendix presents additional details).
A Poisson regression analysis with an offset for the log
survival time between discharge and final follow-up
was used to provide a better approximation of the
survival modeling framework. Analyses were under-
taken for the overall AMI cohort and separately for
cases of STEMI and NSTEMI, and effects were investi-
gated at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year.
To mitigate potential bias caused by missing data,
we used multiple imputation by chained equations to
create 10 datasets from 20 iterations; the resultant
model estimates for each were combined by using
Rubin’s rules (Online Appendix, Online Table 1). A
complete case analysis was also conducted (Online
Tables 2 and 3). Analyses were performed by using
Stata MP64 version 14 (StataCorp, College Station,
Texas) and R version 3.1.2 (R Foundation for Statis-
tical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A p value <0.05
was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Of the 179,810 patients with AMI (91,895 with STEMI
[51.1%]; 87,915 with NSTEMI [48.9%]) and no HF or
LVSD who survived to discharge, 170,475 (94.8%)
(88,542 with STEMI [96.4%]; 81,933 with NSTEMI
[93.2%]) received b-blockers. There were significant
differences
in
baseline
characteristics
between
patients
with
and
without
b-blocker
treatment
(Table
1).
In
particular,
patients
who
received
b-blockers tended to be younger and male compared
with those who did not receive b-blockers (mean age
of 63.3 � 13.4 years and 71.1% male vs. mean age of
68.6 � 15.1 years and 61.7% male, respectively).
Compared with patients who received b-blockers,
those who did not were more frequently comorbid and
of higher ischemic risk, including diabetes (15.4% vs.
11.6%), chronic renal failure (3.2% vs. 1.6%), asthma or
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (20.6% vs.
7.8%), cerebrovascular disease (7.0% vs. 3.8%), and
with an intermediate or high Global Registry of Acute
Coronary Events risk score (76.5% vs. 69.8%). Overall,
the prescription of discharge medications, in-hospital
procedures, and enrollment into cardiac rehabilitation
was higher among those who received b-blockers.
For the entire cohort, with >163,772 person-years
of observation (maximum 1-year follow-up), there
were 9,373 deaths (5.2%). Unadjusted 1-year mortality
was significantly lower for patients who received
b-blockers compared with those who did not (4.9%
vs. 11.2%; p < 0.001).
PROPENSITY SCORE ANALYSES. For the balanced
propensity score analysis, 163,127 observations at the
tails (i.e., outside the bounds of 0.1 to 0.9) of the
estimated
propensity
score
distribution
were
removed, leaving 16,683 patients (4,932 with STEMI
[29.6%]; 11,751 with NSTEMI [70.4%]) for analysis.
Overlap assumption assessment and balance checks
were conducted and the results are summarized in
Online Figures 1 to 5 and Online Tables 4 to 14,
respectively. The assumption was not violated, and
the covariates were balanced. The area under the
curve
for
the
propensity
score
model
was
0.80
(Online Figure 6), which indicated a good discrimi-
nation for the model. After weighting and adjust-
ment, there were no survival differences between
patients with AMI and without HF or LVSD who
received b-blockers and those who did not at any time
point to 1 year (Figure 2, Online Figure 7). Specifically,
at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year after hospitalization
with AMI, there was no significant difference in
mortality when every patient in the analytical cohort
used b-blockers compared with when no patients in
the analytical cohort used b-blockers (ATE coefficient:
0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI]: �2.99 to 3.94
[p ¼ 0.785]; ATE coefficient: 0.06; 95% CI: �0.35 to
0.46 [p ¼ 0.768]; and ATE coefficient: 0.07; 95%
CI: �0.60 to 0.75 [p ¼ 0.827], respectively) (Table 2).
There was also no significant treatment effect for the
use of b-blockers at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year for
STEMI and NSTEMI.

2714
 In the second propensity score analysis of 179,810
patients, and after weighting and adjustment, results
were consistent with the balanced analysis. There
was no significant association of b-blockers with
survival at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year for AMI
overall or separately for STEMI and NSTEMI (Table 2).
INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE ANALYSIS. The instru-
mental variable analysis of 179,810 cases found no
significant
difference
in
mortality
at
1
month,
6 months, and 1 year for patients who did and did not
receive b-blockers (coefficient: �0.003; 95% CI: �1.56
to 1.55 [p ¼ 0.997]; coefficient: 0.18; 95% CI: �0.76 to
1.12 [p ¼ 0.712]; and coefficient: 0.02; 95% CI: �0.64
to 0.68 [p ¼ 0.953], respectively). This result was
consistent
across
cases
of
STEMI
and
NSTEMI
(Table 3). Validity of the instrumental variable was
assessed, and the results are given in the Online
Appendix and Online Table 15.
DISCUSSION
In this prospective, observational cohort study of the
management and outcome of patients with acute
coronary syndrome, using data for all hospitals in a
single health care system, the use of b-blockers was
not associated with a lower risk of death at up to
1 year among patients with AMI without HF or LVSD as
identified during hospitalization (Central Illustration).
Propensity score and instrumental variable analyses
were used to provide insights into this important
question from a large-scale, unselected patient pop-
ulation derived from the MINAP national registry.
Among nearly 17,000 (balanced propensity score
analysis)
and
180,000
(instrumental
variable
analysis) patients between 2007 and 2013 who were
matched for demographic and clinical characteristics,
the lack of association of b-blockers with survival was
evident at 1 month, 6 months, and at 1 year after
hospital discharge for STEMI and NSTEMI without HF
or LVSD. These findings were in line with recom-
mendations from recent guidelines for the manage-
ment of acute coronary syndrome in patients with
and without persistent ST-segment elevation (5,15)
and of clinical importance when the incidence of HF
complicating AMI is in decline (16,17).
However, international guidelines differ in their
recommendations for the use of b-blockers after AMI,
with U.S. guidelines recommending these drugs for all
patients with AMI regardless of left ventricular ejec-
tion fraction or HF (Class I indication), whereas Euro-
pean guidelines have a Class IIa indication for those
without LVSD or HF (5–8). Many patients with AMI
are prescribed b-blockers ad infinitum regardless of
whether they have LVSD, HF, or neither (18). It is
probable that this practice is, in part, supported by
clinical
uncertainty
because
evidence
suggesting
clinical benefit associated with the use of b-blockers in
the context of AMI is varied, historical, extrapolated
from nongeneralizable data, and unclear for AMI
patients without HF. For example, although a meta-
analysis of 31 studies reported an approximately one-
quarter reduction in risk of death associated with
b-blocker use, most of the included studies pre-dated
the introduction of invasive coronary treatments (19).
A meta-analysis of 10 observational studies across
>40,000 patients suggested a lack of evidence to
support the routine use of b-blockers in all patients
with AMI who received PCI, but the effect was

b-Blockers and Mortality in AMI Without Heart Failure

 restricted to those with a reduced ejection fraction,
NSTEMI, and those with low use of secondary pre-
vention medications (9). Moreover, while b-blockers
have been shown to be beneficial if given early after
STEMI in patients who are hemodynamically stable,
this effect is largely driven by a reduction in ventric-
ular arrhythmias and reinfarction, and it was not
known if there was a mortality advantage after 1 month
of use among patients with STEMI or NSTEMI and who
did not have HF or a preserved ejection fraction (4).
No randomized trials have tested the efficacy of
b-blockers on long-term mortality among patients
with AMI without HF or LVSD. Until now, the largest
study,
which
comprised
6,758
propensity
score–
matched patients with AMI, found no reduction in
mortality according to use of b-blockers (20). Notably,
this
study
censored
data
in
2009
and
did
not
investigate the impact of b-blockers on mortality
among patients without HF or according to diagnosis
of STEMI and NSTEMI. A smaller, but more recent
study found that the discontinuation of b-blockers at
1 year was not associated with higher 5-year mortality
(10). This finding is important because guidelines
recommend that b-blockers be prescribed long term
for patients after AMI who have HF, and it is uncer-
tain as to whether b-blockers are beneficial for pa-
tients without HF but who have presented to the
hospital with STEMI or NSTEMI.
In an era of coronary revascularization for AMI,
whether it is primary PCI for acute STEMI or a
risk-dependent early invasive strategy for NSTEMI,
the likelihood of preserving more viable and there-
fore less arrhythmogenic myocardium is potentially
greater
than
that
of
the
noninterventional
era.

2716
 Arguably, in the absence of HF or LVSD, our study
revealed that such patients who do not use b-blockers
are at equal risk of death as those who do. Moreover,
we found that the lack of effect of b-blockers on
survival was evident for both STEMI and NSTEMI,
and at early and later time points. Because b-blockers
are not without potential harm, and given that many
patients report side effects and that incremental
numbers of medications are associated with reduced
drug adherence (21), secondary prevention medica-
tions at hospital discharge for patients with AMI and
without HF may not need to include b-blockers.
Indeed, the European Society of Cardiology STEMI
guidelines suggest that b-blockers be commenced in-
hospital and continued long term after AMI but only
with a Class IIa, Level of Evidence: B recommenda-
tion (6). For NSTEMI, a Class I, Level of Evidence: A
recommendation is provided for the use of b-blockers
but only in the context of HF (5). This recommenda-
tion contrasts with the current American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines,
which recommend oral b-blockers as a Class I indi-
cation for all patients with AMI who do not have a
contraindication (7,8).
STUDY LIMITATIONS. Even though, to our knowl-
edge, this study was the largest analysis to date
(comprising >180,000 cases) of the effectiveness of
b-blockers on mortality after AMI without HF or LVSD,
our study was not without limitations. Only patients
who survived the hospital stay were studied and,
consequently, the role of in-hospital b-blockers was
not investigated (e.g., for patients with early arrhyth-
mias complicating AMI). The presence of HF or LVSD
was only assessed by using data recorded during the
hospital stay, and the risk of developing HF in the year
after AMI, while declining, is not small (16,17). In such
circumstances, there is good evidence that b-blockers
are beneficial and associated with lower mortality rates
and better cardiovascular outcomes (22).
In
addition,
there
was
no
information
in
the
present study about rates of discontinuation, new
prescriptions, or doses of b-blockers after hospital
discharge. It is possible that nonpersistence with

 CENTRAL ILLUSTRATION b-Blockers and Mortality After AMI Without HF
Dondo, T.B. et al. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2017;69(22):2710–20.
In this study, patients experiencing an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) without heart failure (HF) or left ventricular systolic dysfunction were commonly prescribed
b-blockers at hospital discharge (94.8%). However, in this nationwide observational study using propensity score analysis (1-year follow-up), the use of b-blockers
was not associated with a significant difference in survival times after AMI.

 b-blockers explained the lack of impact on mortality
or that patients who did not receive b-blockers at
discharge received them later when reviewed in pri-
mary care. However, in the United Kingdom, patients
receive a minimum of 1 month’s supply of medica-
tions at hospital discharge; only if patients in the
treatment arm were nonadherent with their medica-
tions would this explain our study findings. More-
over, in the United Kingdom, b-blocker persistence is
high after an AMI (18). Although the unadjusted
analysis revealed a large difference in mortality rates
between
those
who
did
and
did
not
receive
b-blockers, the difference was not observed after
adjusting for confounders and selection bias using
propensity score analysis. This finding likely reflects
the fact that unadjusted analyses in observational
data might be influenced by confounding (e.g., the
use of other medical treatments) as well as selection
bias. Notably, our study was a select and non-
randomized sample; in addition, although propensity
scoring and instrumental variable analysis adjusted
for confounding by indication, and further adjust-
ments were made for many additional confounders in
the survival models, residual confounding is prob-
able. Nonetheless, our results are consistent with
other
nonrandomized
data,
albeit
these
studies
used post hoc analyses to investigate the impact of
b-blockers on mortality among AMI patients without
HF or LVSD (10). Clearly, a randomized controlled
trial is a necessary next step for the contemporary
evaluation of b-blockers in AMI without HF or LVSD.
CONCLUSIONS
Among
patients
who
survived
hospitalization
in
England and Wales with STEMI and NSTEMI without
HF or LVSD, b-blocker use was not associated with
lower all-cause mortality at any time point up to
1 year. This result adds to the increasing body of
evidence that the routine prescription of b-blockers
might not be indicated in patients with a normal
ejection fraction or without HF after AMI.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Among hospital
survivors of AMI without HF or LVSD, use of b-blockers was not
associated with a lower risk of death at 1 year.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Clinical trials are needed to
prospectively evaluate the efficacy of b-blockers in patients with
AMI who do not have HF or LVSD.
