IMPORTANCE Previous studies have shown high mortality rates among homeless people in
general, but little is known about the patterns of mortality among “rough sleepers,”the
subgroup of unsheltered urban homeless people who avoid emergency shelters and primarily
sleep outside.
OBJECTIVES To assess the mortality rates and causes of death for a cohort of unsheltered
homeless adults from Boston, Massachusetts.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 10-year prospective cohort study (2000-2009) of
445 unsheltered homeless adults in Boston, Massachusetts, who were seen during daytime
street and overnight van clinical visits performed by the Boston Health Care for the Homeless
Program’
s Street Team during 2000. Data used to describe the unsheltered homeless cohort
and to document causes of death were gathered from clinical encounters, medical records,
the National Death Index, and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health death
occurrence files. The study data set was linked to the death occurrence files by using a
probabilistic record linkage program to confirm the deaths. Data analysis was performed
from May 1, 2015, to September 6, 2016.
EXPOSURE Being unsheltered in an urban setting.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Age-standardized all-cause and cause-specific mortality
rates and age-stratified incident rate ratios that were calculated for the unsheltered adult
cohort using 2 comparison groups: the nonhomeless Massachusetts adult population and
an adult homeless cohort from Boston who slept primarily in shelters.
RESULTS Of 445 unsheltered adults in the study cohort, the mean (SD) age at enrollment
was 44 (11.4) years, 299 participants (67.2%) were non-Hispanic white, and 72.4% were men.
Among the 134 individuals who died, the mean (SD) age at death was 53 (11.4) years. The
all-cause mortality rate for the unsheltered cohort was almost 10 times higher than that of
the Massachusetts population (standardized mortality rate, 9.8; 95% CI, 8.2-11.5) and nearly
3 times higher than that of the adult homeless cohort (standardized mortality rate, 2.7; 95%
CI, 2.3-3.2). Non-Hispanic black individuals had more than half the rate of death compared
with non-Hispanic white individuals, with a rate ratio of 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.7; P < .001). The
most common causes of death were noncommunicable diseases (eg, cancer and heart
disease), alcohol use disorder, and chronic liver disease.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Mortality rates for unsheltered homeless adults in this study
were higher than those for the Massachusetts adult population and a sheltered adult homeless
cohort with equivalent services. This study suggests that this distinct subpopulation of
homeless people merits special attention to meet their unique clinical and psychosocial needs.

 A
paucity of literature exists regarding the health status
of unsheltered, urban homeless adults, also known as
“rough sleepers.” These elusive, yet highly visible un-
sheltered individuals eschew organized shelters and choose
to sleep on park benches, in back alleyways, in doorways, un-
der bridges, near train stations, and in abandoned cars.
In the United States, the unsheltered population consti-
tutesmorethanathirdoftheoverallhomelesspopulation,with
an estimated 192 875 people sleeping unsheltered on a single
night in January 2017.1 Most of these individuals were men 24
years or older of white or non-Hispanic race/ethnicity.1 De-
spite their visibility, this population wanders across our urban
landscapes,anddataontheseindividualsaredifficulttogather.
Previous studies of mortality have focused on the homeless
population who primarily sleep in shelters, and these studies
havefoundhigherratesofdeathinhomelesspopulationscom-
paredwithnonhomelesspopulations.2-9Studiesfromthe1980s
showed common causes of death to be from substance use dis-
orders and unintentional injuries.3-5 Studies from the 1990s re-
vealed HIV/AIDS, when combined, to be a leading cause of
death.6,7 More recently, unintentional overdose was shown to
havereplacedHIV/AIDSasaleadingcauseofdeathinthehome-
lesspopulation.10Literatureontheunshelteredpopulationhas
shown that they have more risk factors for death, more behav-
ioral health issues, more trauma, and poorer health than their
sheltered counterparts.11-13 However, these studies have not
looked specifically at mortality outcomes for unsheltered in-
dividuals, whose unique blend of comorbidities and environ-
mental exposures may place them at higher risk for death.
Abetterunderstandingofthedemographics,mortalitypat-
terns,andcausesofdeathamongunshelteredindividualscould
inform social policy and clinical practice initiatives to im-
prove outcomes in this vulnerable population. To address the
current gap in the literature about this unique subpopula-
tion, we conducted a 10-year, prospective cohort study using
an unsheltered cohort from Boston, Massachusetts, that was
established in 2000 and followed up through the end of
2009. We described the unsheltered cohort, examined causes
of death, and calculated age-specific rate ratios and age-
standardized all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates and
compared this cohort with both the nonhomeless adult popu-
lation living in Massachusetts and a cohort of homeless adults
living in Boston who primarily slept in emergency shelters. We
hypothesized that the unsheltered cohort would have higher
all-causeandcause-specificmortalityratesthanthenonhome-
less and sheltered homeless populations, and that those un-
sheltered homeless individuals would die prematurely from
common but preventable and treatable causes, such as can-
cer, heart disease, and substance use disorders.
Methods
Study Population
The study population consisted of adults living outside who
were primary care patients of the Boston Health Care for the
Homeless Program’
s (BHCHP’
s) Street Team. Eligibility crite-
ria for the study included the following: (1) sleeping outside
for 1 or more nights during 2000; (2) 18 years or older by Janu-
ary 1, 2000; (3) at least 1 face-to-face encounter with the
BHCHP’
s Street Team staff during 2000; and (4) a first and last
name and either a date of birth or a Social Security number in
the study database. Participants were excluded if there was a
lack of identifying information in the study database. Of 568
records in the BHCHP’
s Street Team database, 445 unshel-
tered adults (78.3%) met the eligibility criteria. The study was
approved by the institutional review board of Boston Univer-
sity Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts. Participant in-
formed consent was waived by BHCHP. The study posed mini-
mal risk to privacy.
Study Design and Data Collection
Weconducteda10-yearprospectivestudyfromJanuary1,2000,
throughDecember31,2009.Dataanalysiswasperformedfrom
May 1, 2015, to September 6, 2016. Data from face-to-face en-
counterswiththeBHCHP’
sStreetTeamwereusedforthestudy
and stored prospectively. Face-to-face encounters for primary
care consisted of a BHCHP’
s Street Team clinician meeting an
unsheltered individual on the street or at an outside location
during a daytime or nighttime clinical session. The clinicians of
theBHCHP’
sStreetTeamdocumentedtheseencountersonpa-
per at the time of the visit and the notes were later transcribed
by a research assistant into a database (Microsoft Office Ac-
cess;MicrosoftCorporation).Datacollectedattheinitialandsub-
sequentvisitsincludedthefollowinginformation:firstandlast
names, date and location of the encounter, date of birth, Social
Security number, sex, race/ethnicity, medical and behavioral
health diagnoses, and the name of the clinician performing the
visit. Any new data, such as a date of death, was added to the
database. The cohort had no known duplicates, and no indi-
vidual was added to the cohort after December 31, 2000. Ev-
eryone in the cohort was alive at the time of enrollment.
After the study concluded, the database was matched to
BHCHP’
s electronic medical record to confirm data such as the
correct spelling of the first and last name, sex, race/ethnicity,
date of birth, and Social Security number. The records were
then matched with the Massachusetts Department of Public
Health death occurrence files from 2000 to 2009 (received on
CD from Massachusetts Department of Public Health; Novem-
ber 3, 2014) in the manner described below to confirm deaths,
Key Points
Question What are the mortality patterns for unsheltered
homeless adults who primarily sleep outdoors?
Findings In this 10-year cohort study of 445 unsheltered
homeless adults, the age-standardized all-cause mortality rate
was almost 3-fold larger than that for a cohort of homeless adults
primarily sleeping in shelters and nearly 10-fold larger than that
for the adult population of Massachusetts; both represented
significant differences. Common causes of death were cancer and
heart disease.
Meaning Interventions and models of care need to address the
unique needs of the unsheltered homeless adult population to
improve outcomes.

 add the dates of deaths if they were previously unknown, and
add the underlying and multiple causes of death. Over the
course of the study, reports were requested from the Na-
tional Death Index14 in 2006 and in 2011 to investigate the pos-
sibility of a death occurring outside the state for a proportion
of the cohort whose whereabouts were unknown. Data ex-
tracted from the National Death Index14 reports included the
date of death, the state in which death occurred, and the un-
derlying and multiple causes of death.
All data describing the causes of death were in the format
of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Re-
lated Health Problems, Tenth Edition (ICD-10) diagnosis codes.
The data identifying the underlying and multiple causes of
death taken from the Massachusetts Department of Public
Health and the National Death Index14 were previously pro-
cessed by the National Center for Health Statistics using well-
establishedcomputeralgorithmstoselecttheunderlyingcause
of death from conditions reported on death certificates. Un-
derlying causes of death codes were used for this study and
grouped based on previous literature.7,10,15,16 Definitions of
codes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research
(WONDER) were also used for interpretation of the ICD-10
codes.17 The ICD-10 groupings, terminology, and definitions
used to combine the ICD-10 categories can be found in the
eTable in the Supplement.
Race/ethnicity categories created by BHCHP were as fol-
lows: non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and persons of
color/unknown identified as Asian, Hispanic, American In-
dian, or unknown race/ethnicity. Age categories included 18
to 44 years, 45 to 64 years, and 65 to 84 years. Sex was di-
chotomous without unknowns. There were 2 variables with
missing data: Social Security number was missing in 15 of 445
records (3.4%) and race/ethnicity, 7 of 445 records (1.6%).
Comparison Groups
Two comparison groups (the Massachusetts population and
a sheltered homeless cohort from Boston) were used to cal-
culate the standardized mortality ratios (SMRs). Data for
the Massachusetts population were taken from the CDC’
s
WONDER for ages 18 to 84 years from 2000-2009. The Mas-
sachusetts population was chosen as a comparison group be-
cause our study methods were analogous to methods used in
a 2013 study by Baggett et al,10 who also used the Massachu-
setts population as a comparison group.
Data for the adult homeless cohort were obtained from the
2013 study by Baggett et al.10 They retrospectively assembled
a homeless cohort of 28 033 adults 18 years or older who had
1 or more encounters with a BHCHP clinician between Janu-
ary 1, 2003, and December 31, 2008.10 The comparison co-
hort included homeless adults who were seen by BHCHP from
2003 to 2008.10
Matching Data
Link Plus 2.0, a probabilistic record linkage program devel-
oped at the CDC Division of Cancer Prevention and Control in
support of the CDC’
s National Program of Cancer Registries,
was used to match BHCHP’
s data to the Massachusetts De-
partment of Public Health data. Each match was manually re-
viewed. A death record was accepted as a match if it had the
same data on 1 or more of the following: Social Security num-
ber; first and last name and month and year of birth within a
range of 1 year; or first and last name and month and day of
birth.7,10,14 The algorithm was similar to that used by the Na-
tional Death Index14 to match records and has been reliably
used by previous researchers who studied mortality among
homeless populations.7,10,14
Statistical Analysis
We described the demographic characteristics of the unshel-
tered cohort overall and by subgroups, including sex and vi-
tal status (whether the cohort member was alive or dead and
information about the decedent). Among those in the cohort
who died, we noted the place of death and whether an au-
topsy was performed.
Crude mortality rates for all-cause and cause-specific mor-
tality were calculated using the number of deaths in each cat-
egory divided by person-years of observation for that cat-
egory to create incident rates, expressed as events per 100 000
person-years. Strata-specific incident rate ratios were calcu-
lated by taking one crude mortality rate within a stratum and
dividing it by another crude mortality rate within the same
stratum. For rate ratios, women, non-Hispanic white, and
the young age category (18-44 years) were used as reference
groups.
Age-standardized all-cause and cause-specific mortality
rates were calculated using indirect standardization, with the
unsheltered cohort as the standard population. The SMRs were
calculatedasfollows:bycreatingage-specificmortalityratesper
person-year for young (18-44 years), middle (45-64 years), and
old age (65-84 years) categories for both the Massachusetts
population and the adult homeless cohort; by multiplying the
age-specificmortalityratesbytheage-specificperson-yearsfrom
the unsheltered cohort; by summing the 3 age-specific results
to determine the expected number of deaths; and then by di-
viding the number of observed deaths by the number of ex-
pected deaths. The SMRs were calculated when the number of
deaths in a category was 5 or more.15
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata, version 14
(StataCorp) and Microsoft Excel 2013 (Microsoft Corporation)
and consisted of calculating incidence rates, rate ratios, and
SMRs. Corresponding 95% CIs for rates and ratios were calcu-
lated using OpenEpi (Open Source Epidemiologic Statistics for
Public Health), version 3.01.18 A 2-sided significance level of
<.05 was used for testing.
Results
Cohort Characteristics
The study cohort comprised 445 unique unsheltered adults
who were followed for a total of 3608.7 person-years (mean,
8.2 years; range 0.1-9.9 years). The mean (SD) age at enroll-
ment was 44 (11.4) years with a range of 18 to 81 years. Of 445
participants in the cohort, 299 (67.2%) were non-Hispanic
white and 322 (72.4%) were men (Table 1).

 Decedent Characteristics
Of the 445 unsheltered adults, 134 died during the study pe-
riod.Atotalof122deathswereconfirmedthroughlinkagewith
the Massachusetts Department of Public Health data, and an
additional 12 records were manually matched to the National
Death Index14 reports. The mean (SD) age at death was 53 (11.4)
years. Of the 134 decedents, 116 (86.6%) were men and 108
(80.6%) were non-Hispanic white. A mean (SD) of 13 (3.4)
deaths per year occurred throughout the study. Most deaths
(87 of 134 [64.9%]) occurred inside a health care facility (ie,
inpatient wards, outpatient clinics, emergency departments,
and nursing homes), and 48 (35.8%) resulted in an autopsy.
Mortality Rates
The crude mortality rate overall was 3713.2 (95% CI, 3110.9-
4397.5) deaths per 100 000 person-years (Table 2). The race/
ethnicity specific mortality rate ratio for non-Hispanic blacks
was 0.4 times the rate ratio of death for non-Hispanic whites
(95% CI, 0.2-0.7; P < .001) (Table 2). The SMR for the unshel-
tered cohort was 9.8 (95% CI, 8.2-11.5) relative to the Massa-
chusetts population and 2.7 (95% CI, 2.3-3.2) relative to the
sheltered adult homeless cohort (Table 3).
Causes of Death
Thirty-nine deaths (29.1%) were directly attributable to sub-
stanceusedisordersandunintentionaloverdose(Table3).Non-
poisoning injuries represented 19 of the 134 deaths (14.2%).
Mortality rates in the unsheltered cohort for HIV/AIDS (10 of
134 deaths [7.5%]) were considerably higher than rates in the
Massachusetts population and in the sheltered adult home-
less cohort, and SMRs were significantly elevated among the
unsheltered cohort when compared with both the Massachu-
setts population (SMR, 63.8; 95% CI, 32.4-113.8) and the shel-
tered adult homeless cohort (SMR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.7-6.0). The
one exception was drug overdose, which did not differ be-

 0.9; 95% CI, 0.4-1.7). No deaths occurred from diabetes or
tuberculosis. External causes, such as suicide, homicide, and
hypothermia, which were included in the nonpoisoning in-
jury category, accounted for fewer than 5 deaths each.
Discussion
All-cause mortality rates in the unsheltered cohort were nearly
3 times greater than those in an adult homeless cohort and al-
most 10 times greater than in the Massachusetts population.
Our cause-specific mortality findings underscore a high bur-
den of substance use in this population. In addition to the
deaths directly attributable to substance use, many of the
deaths due to nonpoisoning injuries, which primarily in-
cluded motor vehicle crashes, falls, and drownings, have been
shown by previous researchers to be related to alcohol or other
drug use.20-22 The SMR for nonpoisoning injuries was high for
the unsheltered cohort compared with the adult homeless co-
hort; these results may indicate a possibly greater risk of death
for rough sleepers, but more research is warranted. Other com-
mon causes of death, such as cancer and heart disease, have a
strong link to cigarette smoking, which is highly prevalent
among homeless people.20 To effectively decrease morbidity
and mortality in the unsheltered population, it is necessary to
have fully integrated clinical outreach teams to meet rough
sleepers where they live on the streets in order to establish and
maintain continuity of care.13,23,24 Addiction treatment and re-
covery programs should be readily available, with treatment
on demand to support motivation for action and prevent fur-
ther morbidity and mortality. Future research should include
harm reduction policies, such as managed alcohol programs
or supervised injection sites within shelters and homeless pro-
grams,whichmightmakesheltersmoretolerableforthosewho
currently fear substance abuse withdrawal.25,26
Higher rates of death among non-Hispanic white individu-
als compared with non-Hispanic black individuals and per-
sonsofcolorhavebeenconsistentlyobservedinpreviousstud-
ies of homeless persons, and the causes for this phenomenon
arelikelymultifactorial.2,4,5,7,8,10Similarly,studieshaveshown
that homeless men have higher rates of death than homeless
women. Non-Hispanic white individuals and men, on aver-
age, have more economic resources than non-Hispanic black
individuals and women and are less likely to have experi-
enced adverse social and economic effects due to bias or
discrimination.27 Thus, non-Hispanic white individuals and
men may, on average, have reached a higher threshold of co-
morbidities at the time that they become homeless com-
paredwithnon-Hispanicblackindividualsandpersonsofcolor.
Men, whether or not they are homeless, are at a higher risk of
death at an earlier age than women because of risk-taking be-
haviors related to the male sex. However, more research with
empiricaldataneedstobeconductedtofullyunderstandthese
disparities among the unsheltered homeless.
Limitations
Although the study was subject to some biases that we could
not control, we believe the influences were minor. Some un-
sheltered adults living on the streets of Boston may not have

a Adult sheltered homeless cohort from the study by Baggett et al.10
bThere were no unknown causes of death, and fewer than 5 deaths in each
category were suppressed.
c The SMR was calculated when there were 5 or more deaths in each category.
dNonpoisoning injuries (ICD-10 diagnosis codes): transportation accidents
(codes V01-V99), other external causes of accidental injuries (codes
W00-X59, except X40-X49), and events of undetermined intent (codes
Y20-Y34, except Y10-Y19). Methodology in combining the ICD-10 categories
were based on the Health of Boston 2014-2015 report.15

 not included in the cohort, which created a potential selec-
tion bias toward those homeless adults who sought health
services. Since Boston is a moderately sized city with an
extensive network of outreach services provided by the
BHCHP’
s Street Team and their community partners, the num-
ber of individuals not served by BHCHP during enrollment was
likely to have been small. Additional bias could have oc-
curred if someone entered the cohort and then traveled to an-
other state and died while living in another state. Obtaining
National Death Index14 records improved our ability to detect
deaths that occurred outside the state. The BHCHP’
s Street
Team database contained 123 records with insufficient iden-
tifying information to be included in the study. These ex-
cluded individuals could be systematically different from in-
dividualsincludedinthestudyinimportantways,suchastheir
level of illness or the length of time that they were homeless.
Based on our clinical experience, an alternative explanation
was that most of these records with insufficient identifying in-
formation were duplicate records of identified cohort mem-
bers because a new record was opened, rather than an exist-
ing one updated, when identifiers were learned.
Additionallimitationsincludedalackofinformationabout
individual comorbidities or the chronicity of being homeless
before or during the observation period; both could have con-
tributed to a more nuanced understanding of mortality risk in
this population. Some causes of death were too rare to ascer-
tain mortality rates. A larger cohort would be required to ad-
dress this limitation in future studies. Some overlap of the 2
homeless cohorts may have occurred, but the overlap was be-
lieved to have been small because BHCHP’
s data on sleeping
location from 2008 showed that the proportion of patients
sleeping outside was small (1%-3%) and the time frames of the
2cohortswerenotexact.Iftherewasoverlap,estimatesofmor-
tality using the sheltered adult homeless cohort as a compari-
son would be conservative.
Choosing Massachusetts as a comparison population in-
stead of Boston could be considered a limitation of the study;
however, some of our methods were based on those used by
Baggett et al10 in their 2013 study, in which the Massachu-
setts population was the comparison group. In addition, dur-
ingthetimeframeofthestudy,theage-adjusted,all-causemor-
tality rate in Boston (687 per 100 000 population) was only
slightly higher than the age-adjusted, all-cause mortality rate
for Massachusetts (669 per 100 000 population).15,28 We
anticipated that confounding by race/ethnicity would be
minimal given that the study cohort was disproportionately
of non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity as was the Massachu-
setts population.
Generalizability to cities outside Boston could be af-
fected by difference in access to homeless shelters, health in-
surance, and health care. Boston guarantees each homeless
person access to emergency homeless shelters each night.29
Not every city across the United States makes this guarantee,
and the homeless people accessing shelters in Boston may dif-
fer from the homeless accessing, or not accessing, shelters in
another city. Most of Boston’
s shelters have few limits on the
length of stay and have little to no requirements regarding
sobriety. These shelters accept individuals struggling with al-
cohol and other drugs, an important factor in minimizing the
number of unsheltered individuals in Boston. Shelters in many
cities have limits on the length of stay or requirements for so-
briety and do not allow individuals with active substance use
disorders, which increases the number of homeless people liv-
ing outside. Access to health care and health insurance were
availabletoourcohort,butitwasnotuniformacrosstheUnited
States, particularly during the time of the study. These fac-
tors could influence mortality for those individuals sleeping
outside in different locations and thereby influence the gen-
eralizability of our results. Our study provides important in-
sights about mortality patterns in this previously overlooked
group of highly vulnerable individuals.
Conclusions
Our study results showed that unsheltered adults had a higher
all-causemortalityratethanamostlyshelteredhomelessadult
population in Boston, a finding that to our knowledge is not
previously reported in the literature. The unsheltered cohort
died at a relatively young age of both noncommunicable and
substance-attributable causes of death. Access to a patient-
centered, outreach service model with integrated medical and
behavioral health care delivered directly to the unsheltered
population is necessary to begin to address these disparities.
A better understanding of the social and supportive services
is necessary to augment an integrated outreach team. Ser-
vices such as harm-reduction models; greater availability and
access to substance use disorder treatment, including smok-
ing cessation; and a continuum of housing models with flex-
ible social services to meet individual needs for successful ten-
ancies and improved health are also needed to ultimately
improve health disparities borne by those sleeping outside.30
