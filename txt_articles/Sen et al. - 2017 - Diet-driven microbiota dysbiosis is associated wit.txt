Abstract
Obesity is one of the major health issues in the United States. Consumption of diets rich in energy, 
notably from fats and sugars (high-fat/high-sugar diet: HF/HSD) is linked to the development of 
obesity and a popular dietary approach for weight loss is to reduce fat intake. Obesity research 
traditionally uses low and high fat diets and there has been limited investigation of the potential 
detrimental effects of a low-fat/high-sugar diet (LF/HSD) on body fat accumulation and health. 
Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the effects of HF/HSD and LF/HSD on microbiota 
composition, gut inflammation, gut-brain vagal communication and body fat accumulation. 
Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that LF/HSD changes the gut microbiota, induces gut 
inflammation and alters vagal gut-brain communication, associated with increased body fat 
accumulation.
Sprague-Dawley rats were fed an HF/HSD, LF/HSD or control low-fat/low-sugar diet (LF/LSD) 
for 4 weeks. Body weight, caloric intake, and body composition were monitored daily and fecal 
samples were collected at baseline, 1, 6 and 27 days after the dietary switch. After four weeks, 
blood and tissues (gut, brain, liver and nodose ganglia) were sampled. Both HF/HSD and LF/
HSD-fed rats displayed significant increases in body weight and body fat compared to LF/LSD-
fed rats. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that both HF/HSD and LF/HSD-fed animals exhibited gut

 microbiota dysbiosis characterized by an overall decrease in bacterial diversity and an increase in 
Firmicutes/Bacteriodetes ratio. Dysbiosis was typified by a bloom in Clostridia and Bacilli and a 
marked decrease in Lactobacillus spp. LF/HSD-fed animals showed a specific increase in 
Sutterella and Bilophila, both Proteobacteria, abundances of which have been associated with liver 
damage. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β and TNFα was 
upregulated in the cecum while levels of tight junction protein occludin were downregulated in 
both HF/HSD and LF/HSD fed rats. HF/HSD and LF/HSD-fed rats also exhibited an increase in 
cecum and serum levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a pro-inflammatory bacterial product. 
Immunofluorescence revealed the withdrawal of vagal afferents from the gut and at their site of 
termination the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in both the HF/HSD and LF/HSD rats. 
Moreover, there was significant microglia activation in the nodose ganglia, which contain the 
vagal afferent neuron cell bodies, of HF/HSD and LF/HSD rats. Taken together, these data indicate 
that, similar to HF/HSD, consumption of an LF/HSD induces dysbiosis of gut microbiota, 
increases gut inflammation and alters vagal gut-brain communication. These changes are 
associated with an increase in body fat accumulation.

1. INTRODUCTION
Obesity has reached epidemic proportion in Western countries, including the United States 
[1]. Evidence suggests that consumption of an energy-dense high-fat/high-sugar diet (HF/
HSD) promotes excessive weight gain and that there is a direct relationship between the 
amount of dietary fat and the degree of obesity [2]. Consequently, lowering dietary fat intake 
has been considered one of the best approaches for weight management. However, a 
growing body of evidence has been pointing to its inadequacy for weight loss or disease 
prevention [3, 4]. Interestingly, many commercial low-fat foods are high in sugar and refined 
carbohydrates [5] and increased intake of sugars, especially fructose has been linked to 
increased body fat accumulation and obesity [6].
There is evidence that the gut microbiota plays a role in obesity [7]. In humans and animal 
models, changes in diet composition can rapidly trigger changes in gut microbiota 
composition [8, 9]. Interestingly, colonization of germ-free (GF) animals with either a “lean” 
or an “obese” microbiota leads to a recapitulation of the donor phenotype, identifying the 
gut microbiota as a potential driver of obesity [10]. The gut microbiota impacts the host 
metabolism and notably affects energy harvest and fat storage [8, 10] as well as 
inflammatory status [10, 11]. Consumption of HF/HSD has been associated with increased 
production of bacterial pro-inflammatory factors, such a lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a 
breakdown product of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria) [7, 11]. Moreover, 
diet-driven gut inflammation results in impairment in the gut epithelial barrier leading to 
enhanced LPS uptake into the plasma [7, 12]. An increase in circulating LPS, also called 
metabolic endotoxemia, can trigger systemic inflammation, impair liver function, alter food 
intake [12] and promote body fat accumulation [11, 12]. Interestingly, LPS has been shown

 in culture to activate vagal afferent neurons [13] and chronic treatment with low doses of 
LPS results in NG inflammation and impairs vagal satiety signaling [12].
Gut-originating peptides signal via the vagus nerve to control meal initiation and termination 
[14, 15]. Disruption of vagal afferent signaling is sufficient to drive obesity in a diet-induced 
rat obesity model [13]. Therefore, microbiota-mediated dysregulation of gut-brain vagal 
communication might contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and its related diseases.
In the present study, we investigated the influence of diets rich in sugars, with different fat 
contents, on microbiota composition and gut-brain axis inflammation. Results show that 
regardless of fat contents, diets rich in sugars promote gut microbiota dysbiosis, induce gut 
inflammation, increase gut permeability, and alter vagal gut-brain communication when 
compared to control chow diet.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Animals and diet
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (6 weeks old; Envigo, Indianapolis, IN) were housed in 
individual plastic cages in a temperature-controlled vivarium with ad libitum access to food 
and water. Rats were maintained on a 12-h light/dark schedule and habituated to laboratory 
conditions for one week before their diet was changed. All animal procedures were approved 
by the University of Georgia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed 
to National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of Laboratory animals 
(publication No. 8023, revised 1978). All efforts were made to minimize both the number of 
animals used and animal suffering.
Rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups (n = 4) and fed for four weeks 
with either normal low fat, low sucrose laboratory chow (LF/LSD, kcal%: Carb, 58; Fat, 
13.5; Prot, 24.5, # 5053, PicoLab Rodent diet, Louis, MO); high-fat, high sucrose diet (HF/
HSD; Kcal%: Carb, 35; Fat, 45; Prot, 20, # D12451, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ), 
or sucrose matched low-fat diet (LF/HSD; Kcal%: Carb, 70; Fat, 10; Prot, 20, # D12450H, 
Research Diets) with each of the diets containing sufficient minerals and vitamins (Table 1). 
LF/HSD and HF/HSD primarily contain refined carbohydrates and were matched for 
sucrose content; while the LF/LSD contains less than one-fifth the amount of sucrose (3.2% 
kcal) as the other two diets (17% kcal). The composition of the LF/LSD was analyzed by NP 
Analytical Laboratories (St. Louis, MO).
2.2 Measurement of body composition, body weight, and food intake
Body weight, body composition, and food intake were measured daily throughout the 
experiment. A Minispec LF 110 BCA Analyzer (Bruker Corp., The Woodlands, TX), which 
uses whole-body magnetic resonance relaxometry in non-anesthetized rodents, was used to 
measure the body composition with linearity and reproducibility [16]. All food intake was 
reported in kcal and was broken down into kcals from fat and sugar based upon the 
composition of each diet. The food intake was measured daily. Preweighed food (~50g) was 
provided in standard stainless steel hoppers. After 24 h, rats were briefly removed from their 
cages and weighed, and the amount of food remaining, including any on the bottom of the

 cages or bedding crumbs, was recorded. Intake was calculated as the weight (in grams) of 
food provided minus that recovered. The total fat gain on each diet was calculated by 
subtracting body fat (g) at baseline from body fat (g) at study end. Total kcal consumed 
divided by total body fat (g) gained provided the kcal needed to gain 1g of body fat while on 
each diet. Similarly, total fat or sugar kcal consumed was divided by total body fat gained to 
determine fat kcal or sugar kcal needed to gain 1g of body fat.
2.3 Microbiota Analysis
Fecal samples were collected at baseline, 1 d, 6 d and 27 d after the dietary switch. Bacterial 
DNA was extracted from feces using a commercial kit and following the recommendation of 
the manufacturer (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). Briefly, fecal contents were lysed by bead 
beating and DNA was isolated using fast-spin columns. DNA was filtered to remove humic 
acids and polyphenols and the eluted DNA was sent to SeqMatic (Fremont, CA) for 
sequencing. A library was generated by targeting the 16S V4 region. Sequencing was 
performed via Illumina MiSeq and sequences aligned to reference genomes. Diversity was 
determined using the Shannon-Weiner index. Abundances were normalized by log 
transformation and METAGENAssit platform [17] was used for phylogenic quantification 
and principal component analysis [17]. To identify discriminant taxa between groups, linear 
discriminant analysis was conducted using the Galaxy platform [18, 19].
2.4 Tissue fixation and sectioning
Immediately following euthanasia, the cecum and part of the liver were sampled. Rats were 
then transcardially perfused with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) followed 
by 4% paraformaldehyde (over 20 minutes). Hindbrains and nodose ganglia were harvested, 
post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 hours, and immersed overnight in 18% sucrose in 
PBS and 0.1% NaN3 (Sigma-Aldrich; pH 7.4). Hindbrains were sectioned at 20 μm 
throughout the caudal to the rostral extent of the NTS (between bregma −14.16 and −12.93 
mm) and stained for selected antigens. Nodose ganglia were sectioned at 15 μm and stained 
for selected antigens.
2.5 Immunofluorescence
Primary and secondary antibodies used in the study are listed in Table 2. After blocking in 
10% normal horse serum in Tris-phosphate buffered saline (TPBS, pH 7.4) sections were 
incubated overnight with a primary antibody against ionized calcium binding adaptor 
molecule 1 (Iba1) followed by an Alexa-488 secondary antibody (Invitrogen, CA) to 
visualize microglia activation as previously described [20]. The hindbrain sections were 
incubated with isolectin B4 biotin-conjugated (IB4) for 12 h at room temperature to 
visualize primary unmyelinated vagal afferents innervating the GI tract as previously 
described [21], followed by ExtrAvidin-CY3 (1:600, E-4142, Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h. 
Negative controls were performed by omission of primary antibodies. Sections were 
mounted in ProLong (Molecular Probes, OR) and examined under Nikon 80-I fluorescent 
microscope as previously described [20, 22].

 2.6 Immunofluorescence quantification
Images of the NG and dorsal vagal complex were captured under 20× magnification with a 
Nikon 80i imaging photomicroscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a digital camera 
(Nikon Digital Sight DS-Qi1Mc), and appropriate filters for DAPI, Alexa 488, and 
ExtrAvidin-CY3. Stitched large images were produced for NG and dorsal vagal complex for 
the analysis. Images were analyzed with the Nikon Elements AR 3.0 Imaging software 
(Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).
The number of positive-stained profiles for a particular antigen (Iba1 and IB4) was 
quantified as described in our previous studies [22], using binary imaging analysis based on 
principles described by Hunter et al. [23]. Briefly, a binary threshold was set at the mean 
intensity plus standard deviations to separate positively labeled fibers or cells from the 
background. The area of positively labeled fibers or cells above the binary threshold was 
recorded for each section. For each animal, the analyzed sections were binned by calculating 
the average area across three serial sections. The reported values represent the group mean 
of these binned values. For the preparation of the microscopic illustrations, Adobe (San Jose, 
CA) Photoshop CS5 was used to adjust only the brightness, contrast, and sharpness and to 
make composite plates.
2.7 LPS measurement
Blood was collected intracardially with a sterile syringe during the euthanasia process and 
allowed to clot for 30 min on ice. Serum was then collected following centrifugation at 
1,000× g for 10 minutes at 4°C. LPS was measured in serum and cecal content 
(homogenized in PBS) as previously described [12]. Briefly, LPS was quantified using a 
Pyrochrome Lysate Mix, a quantitative chromogenic reagent, diluted in Glucashield buffer 
which inhibits cross-reactivity with (1 → 3)- β-D-Glucans (Associate of Cape Cod, East 
Falmouth, MA, USA). Samples were diluted 1:10 in pyrogen-free water (Associate of Cape 
Cod) and heated for 10 min at 70°C. Samples and reactive solution were incubated at 37°C 
for 15 min (for cecum) 30 min (for serum) and absorbance was read at 405 nm.
2.8 Western blot analysis
Binding of IB4 and expression of occludin, NF-kB p65, histone H3 and beta-3-tubulin was 
analyzed by western blotting. Primary and secondary antibodies used in the study are listed 
in Table 2. Fresh cecal tissues were washed in PBS and homogenized on ice for 30 min in 
RIPA buffer [0.5M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5M NaCl, 2.5% deoxycholic acid, 10% NP-40, 10 
mM EDTA, supplemented with 1 mM phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor 
mixture (EMD Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts)]. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 
15 min, the supernatant was harvested. Nuclear and cytosolic subcellular fractions were 
prepared using a Nuclear/Cytosol Fractionation kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA) 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The protein concentration was determined using a 
Pierce™ Coomassie Plus (Bradford) Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher scientific, Grand Island, 
NY). Equal amounts of protein (50 to 75 μg each) were mixed with 4X Bolt® LDS Sample 
Buffer and sample reducing agent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), run on 4–12% NuPAGE, and 
electroblotted onto Nitrocellulose membrane (iBlot® 2 Dry Blotting System, Invitrogen, 
Carlsbad, CA). For subcellular fractions, 40 μg of each of the extracts were subjected to

 electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel followed by immunoblotting using appropriate 
antibodies. The membrane was blocked with PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 and 
5% nonfat milk or 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature, and probed with primary antibody 
(Table 2) overnight at 4°C followed by appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies (IR 
Dye800 or IR Dye680; LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) for 1 h at room temperature. β-
actin and Histone H3 were used as loading controls for the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions 
respectively. Immunoblots were visualized using the LI-COR Odyssey CLx. Quantification 
was done using Image Studio (LI-COR Biosciences); lanes were defined and bands were 
automatically identified. The profile feature was used to identify band boundaries and lane 
background was subtracted. Optimization of images for publication was performed by 
adjusting the brightness and contrast in Image Studio (LI-COR Biosciences).
2.9 RNA extraction and Real-Time RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA from fresh cecum samples was isolated using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, 
MD) according to manufacturer’s instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 
μg of total RNA using qScript™ cDNA SuperMix kit (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, 
MD). Amplifications were performed on Step one plus real-time PCR system (Applied 
Biosystems, Austin, TX) (95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 
seconds, 55°C for 40 seconds and 62°C for 60 seconds) using SYBR Green-based PCR 
master mix (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was determined using the ΔΔCt method 
with 18S as the housekeeping gene [24]. Primers for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), 
interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β) were ordered from Real Time Primers 
(Elkins Park, PA) and TNFα F:CCCATTACTCTGACCCCTTT, R: 
TGAGCATCGTAGTTGTTGGA; IL-1β F:AGAGTGTGGATCCCAAACAA, R: 
AGTCAACTATGTCCCGACCA; IL-6 F:CTTCCTACCCCAACTTCCAA,

GATGTGGTAGCCGTTTCTC.
2.10 Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA) was used for statistical analysis and 
to plot the data unless noted otherwise. The 5% (P<0.05) significance level was adopted. 
Variables from the three groups (LF/LSD, LF/HSD, and HF/HSD) were compared using 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparisons were performed using the Tukey-
Kramer post-hoc test (P<0.05) unless noted otherwise. Repeated measures two-way ANOVA 
tests were used to assess the differences between groups over time for body weight gain, 
body fat, and lean mass, considering treatment and time as repeated factors. The post-hoc 
Tukey–Kramer test was used when significance was detected by multiple comparisons. Data 
for energy intake, LPS analysis, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence quantification 
were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer post-tests for 
comparisons between HF/HSD, LF/HSD, and LF/LSD control. Each graph depicts the mean 
± standard error of the mean [10].

 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Consumption of diets rich in sugars can promote obesity
We determined the animals’ body weight, body fat mass, and lean mass at baseline and 
throughout the four-week feeding study. As expected, there were no significant differences 
in body weight and body composition between groups at baseline (Figure 1A). However, 
body weights of the LF/HSD and HF/HSD fed rats were significantly increased after 4 
weeks on their respective diets when compared to the LF/LSD control rats (Figure 1A). The 
HF/HSD fed animals weighed significantly more than the LF/LSD after only one week on 
their diet (LF/LSD: 332.12±3.8g and HF/HSD: 355.94±7.4g), while, the LF/HSD fed 
became significantly heavier than the LF/LSD-fed rats after week 3 of their diet (LF/LSD: 
351.36±6.4g and LF/HSD: 373.15±6.2g). At the end of the experiment, HF/HSD fed rats 
were significantly heavier than both LF fed groups (LF/LSD: 361.7±7g, LF/HSD: 
379.2±7.3g and HF/HSD: 402.4±8.1g).
The increase in body weight was due to an increase in adiposity. The growth and 
development of the rats was found to be unaffected by the diets as the body length and tail 
growth were unaltered between the groups in four weeks (data not shown). Total body fat 
mass significantly increased with both high sugar diets with no significant differences in 
lean body mass (Figure 1B and 1C). HF/HSD fed rats displayed a significant increase in 
body fat mass within a day of diet introduction when compared to both LF fed groups. 
LF/HSD fed rats showed a significant increase in body fat mass a week following diet 
introduction when compared to the LF/LSD control rats. (Figure 1B). Overall, body fat mass 
was greater in LF/HSD than LF/LSD (LF/HSD: 39±3.1 g and LF/LSD: 29.7±2 g) and 
greater in HF/HSD than both LF fed groups (HF/HSD: 59.8±8.5 g) (Figure 1B).
Sprague-Dawley rats have previously been reported to display different phenotypes (obesity-
prone and obesity-resistant) when fed a high-fat diet [25]. In this particular cohort, only one 
animal was somewhat resistant to diet-induced obesity. It should be noted that LF/LSD has 
not systematically been used as control diets and previous studies have used LF/HSD for 
control. In this study, all animals were included in the HF/HSD group and were all 
significantly heavier than the LF/LSD.
Interestingly, consumption of both the LF/HSD and HF/HSD led to a significant increase in 
body fat and body weight compared to the LF/LSD leading us to conclude that diets rich in 
sugars can promote obesity. The combination of HF and HS exacerbated the obese 
phenotype, however, because we did not include an HF/LSD group, we do not know if these 
effects are additive or synergistic.
3.2. HSD promote liver fat infiltration
Increased fat infiltration in the liver is a risk factor for metabolic abnormalities [26]. Because 
of its anatomical location, blood supply, immunological repertoire, and multiple metabolic 
roles, the liver is continually exposed to gut-derived factors (including microbes, microbial 
components, and products of microbe-gut interactions) that traverse the gut barrier and gain 
access to the bloodstream. Recent studies have shown that a leaky gut can contribute to the

 onset and progression of liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
[27].
In this study, we found that liver fat was significantly increased in the LF/HSD group 
compared to LF/LSD-fed rats (LF/LSD: 12.05 ± 1.317g, LF/HSD: 19.575 ± 2.013 g; p<0.05 
by one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey–Kramer test). We did not find statistically 
significant changes in liver fat accumulation between LF/LSD and HF/HSD or LF/HSD and 
HF/HSD-fed rats (LF/LSD: 12.05 ± 1.317g, LF/HSD: 19.575 ± 2.013 g and HF/HSD: 13.8 
± 2.539 g).
We speculated that the extent of liver fat accumulation might correlate with abundance and 
overgrowth of specific groups of bacteria. It is possible that bacteria and/or bacterial 
metabolites affect the regulation of energy metabolism by controlling the transcription of 
metabolic mediators (e.g., PPARγ, Fiaf) or other enzymes involved in de novo fatty acid 
synthesis [10]. This hypothesis is supported by the previous finding that a low-fat, high-
carbohydrate diet promotes the development of a fatty liver through de novo fatty acid 
synthesis [28, 29].
3.3. HSDs alter energy efficiency and promote body fat accumulation
The introduction of HF/HSD led to a significant increase in energy intake during the first 
week of exposure when compared to the LF/HSD and LF/LSD control group. By week 2, 
intake was normalized and there were no significance differences between the LF/LSD and 
HF/HSD throughout the rest of the experiment. Conversely, starting at week 2, rats fed the 
LF/HSD consumed significantly less kcal than the LF/LSD control group and the HF/HSD 
fed animals. Difference between the LF/HSD and HF/HSD did not reach significance at 
week 4 (Figure 2A).
The LF/HSD rats had increased body fat accumulation (Figure 1B) when compared to the 
LF/LSD rat while consuming fewer calories (Figure 2A). HF/HSD fed rats consumed 
significantly more calories from fat than the two LF fed groups. Conversely, LF/HSD rats 
consumed significantly fewer calories from fat than the LF/LSD fed animals (Figure 2B). 
Both LF/HSD and HF/HSD fed animals consumed significantly more calories from sugars 
than the LF/LSD control group (Figure 2C). Energy efficiency (the amount of energy needed 
to gain 1 gram of body fat) was dramatically altered by high sugar diets. Both LF/HSD and 
HF/HSD rats were required to consume significantly fewer calories to gain a gram of body 
fat than the LF/LSD animals (Figure 2D) suggesting that, despite providing less fat, the 
LF/HSD diet modified body fat metabolism and storage similarly to the energy dense 
HF/HSD resulting in an increase in adiposity [30]. HSD may also be downregulating energy 
expenditure [31], however, we did not measure it in this study.
We concluded that diet composition plays a critical role in regulating fat storage and diets 
rich in sugars may promote adiposity. However, the observed increased body fat 
accumulation cannot be attributed solely to just the sugar content because of some fiber and 
microelements differences between the control (LF/LSD) and high-sugar diets used in the 
study.

 3.4. HSD consumption significantly alters gut microbial ecology
Diet-induced obesity is associated with marked changes in the microbiota composition, and 
there is evidence that microbiota composition can regulate body fat accumulation; 
colonization of GF mice with the microbiota from a diet-induced obese animal notably leads 
to a significant increase in body fat [32, 33]. Previous studies have shown that diet-induced 
dysbiosis and associated impairment in gut function are especially marked in the distal gut, 
including the colon and cecum [34, 35]. In the present study, we focused on fecal microbiota 
composition.
We characterized the microbiota composition at baseline, 24hrs (day 1), 6 days (week 1) and 
26 days (week 4) post-diets introduction. The rarefaction curve for this analysis indicates 
>120,000 sequences and >1,000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) per sample on average 
(Supplementary Figure S1). Principal component analysis (PCA) using all phylogenic levels 
was used to characterized the microbiota profile (Figure 3A). At baseline (B) and day 1 
(D1), all animals clustered together. LF/LSD rats at week 1 (W1) and week 4 (W4) still 
clustered with their baseline profiles, while LF/HSD and HF/HSD clustered together. These 
results are further confirmed by heatmap analysis with dendrogram (Supplementary Figure 
S2). Diets rich in sugars, regardless of fat contents, induced rapid microbiota dysbiosis.
A loss of microbial diversity is the most common presentation of intestinal dysbiosis and has 
been associated with many disease states including obesity [36, 37]. In the present study, we 
calculated the Shannon-Weiner index which takes into account richness (number of species) 
and evenness (abundances distribution). Consumption of a diet rich in sugar, regardless of fat 
contents, led to a significant decrease in microbial diversity within a week of diet 
introduction. This significantly reduced microbial diversity was maintained in both HF/HSD 
and LF/HSD groups through the end of the experiment (Figure 3B). Microbiota composition 
was not significantly different at week 1 and week 4. The detailed week 4 composition is 
shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4A displays the fecal microbiota composition of each of the three groups with all 
phylogenic levels with an abundance >1% represented. Separate phylogenic abundances can 
be found in the supplementary data (Supplementary Figures S3–S4). At the phylum level, 
HSD consumption led to a significant increase in Firmicutes abundance and a decrease in 
Bacteriodetes, these changes being more marked in the HF/HSD group. Diet-induced 
obesity has previously been reported to be associated with decreased levels of Bacteroidetes 
and an increase in Firmicutes abundance when compared to lean controls [32, 38]. Despite 
an overall increase in Firmicutes, HSD consumption led to a significant reduction in Bacilli, 
particularly Lactobacillus, a known probiotic [39]. Conversely, Clostridia abundance 
bloomed under the HSD, especially the Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families; 
higher abundances of these two families have been previously reported in obese animals 
[40–42] and are believed to promote body fat accumulation [43].
HSD-induced dysbiosis was overall more marked in the HF/HSD fed rats, which notably 
displayed elevated Micrococcaceae, a family of Actinobacteria. Actinobacteria abundance 
has previously been shown to be regulated by dietary fat [44] and to be elevated in obese 
individuals [8]. Surprisingly, Micrococcaceae had previously been reported to preferentially

 colonize the upper gastrointestinal tract [45]. Additionally, HF/HSD led to a specific 
increase in Anaeroplasmatales abundance; Anaeroplasmatales are an order of Mollicutes 
bacteria, a class of Tenericutes that has been previously linked to diet-induced obesity and 
increased fat deposition [32, 33] (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure S5).
LF/HSD led to a specific increase in Proteobacteria, which was largely mediated by an 
increase in abundances of genera Sutterella and Bilophila (Figure 4B and Supplementary 
Figure S5). An increase in Betaprotebacteria abundance has been associated with enhanced 
liver fat deposition [46]. Specifically, in humans, the family Sutterellaceae has been shown 
to be associated with short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetate and butyrate [47], 
which can promote liver lipogenesis [48] while in mice, reduction in Bilophila abundance is 
associated with a decrease in liver fat infiltration [49].
Interestingly, abundances of Actinobacteria (Class) and Tenericutes were negatively 
correlated with Betaproteobacteria abundance (Supplementary Figure S6). Since 
Betaproteobacteria promotes fat deposition in the liver, HF/HSD driven increases in 
Actinobacteria and Tenericutes may explain the counterintuitive effect of HF consumption 
on liver fat in this study. Interestingly, a diet rich in medium and long chain saturated fatty 
acids has previously been shown to counterbalance the effect of ethanol on liver 
inflammation and fat accumulation [50].
3.5. HSD consumption led to an increase in metabolic endotoxemia
In the present study, we found that HSD consumption, regardless of fat contents led to a 
significant increase in cecal and circulating LPS levels when compared to control LF/LSD-
fed animals (Figure 5A, B). Although there was no significant difference in LPS levels 
between HF/HSD and LF/HSD, HF/HSD fed animals displayed higher LPS levels in both 
cecum and serum at the end of the experiment (Figure 5A, B), which may be directly related 
to the exaggerated dysbiosis observed in these animals.
The increase in circulating LPS has previously been reported in diet-induced obesity models 
[11]. Interestingly, in rodents, chronic administration of LPS led to an increase in body fat 
mass [11, 12] which was not systematically accompanied by an increase in food intake [11] 
suggesting that LPS can modulate fat metabolism and body fat accumulation.
3.6. Consumption of HSD promotes gut inflammation and impaired gut epithelial function
LPS binding to its receptor (Toll-like receptor-4, TLR4) leads to nuclear translocation of 
transcription factor NF-κB and upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines expressions, 
such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. We have previously shown that diet-induced dysbiosis is 
associated with an increase in intestinal TLR-4 activation, resulting in gastrointestinal 
inflammation [38]. Gut inflammation can alter tight junction protein expression and 
localization, notably occludin [51] resulting in an increase in gut permeability. A leaky gut 
allows for LPS translocation to the general circulation and promotes systemic inflammation 
[7].
Consistent with increased LPS levels (Figure 5), nuclear translocation and activation of NF-
κB were considerably higher in both LF/HSD, and HF/HSD compared to that of LF/LSD-

 fed group (Figure 6A). Consumption of HSD, regardless of fat contents, promoted distal gut 
inflammation compared to the LF/LSD control, as shown by the significant increase in pro-
inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-1β and TNFα, expression in cecum tissues (Figure 6B). In 
accordance with these data, we found that cecal occludin protein levels were greatly reduced 
in both LF/HSD and HF/HSD-fed rats compared to of LF/LSD-fed rats (Figure 6C, D).
We concluded that consumption of a diet rich in sugars, regardless of energy density and fat 
contents can promote gut inflammation and impair gut permeability. In combination with 
dysbiosis, impaired gut function can promote metabolic endotoxemia as we have observed in 
the HSD fed animals.
3.7. Consumption of HSD led to vagal withdrawal and remodeling
We have previously shown that LPS can activate vagal afferent neurons and impair satiety 
signaling in rodents [12]. Therefore, to investigate the effects of diet-induced microbial 
dysbiosis on the vagal system, we examined the gut-brain vagal innervation after 
consumption of HF/HSD, LF/HSD or LF/LSD for four weeks.
We first quantified IB4 binding and β3-tubulin protein expression in cecum samples. β3-
tubulin is regarded as a neuron-specific marker [52]. IB4 is a marker of unmyelinated c type 
fiber neurons and can be used to detect vagal and spinal afferents [53, 54]. We found that 
both the LF/HSD and HF/HSD led to a significant decrease in IB4 binding and ß3-tubulin 
protein expression when compared to LF/LSD (Figure 6E, F, and G), suggesting the 
consumption of HSD can compromise gut innervation. The decrease in IB4 binding was 
significantly more pronounced in the HF/HSD when compared to the LF/HSD.
Vagal sensitivity to gut-originating signals, including satiety peptides, has been shown to 
decrease in HF/HSD fed animals [55, 56] and may be related to the loss of gut innervation. 
In our study, the decrease in innervation was more marked in HF/HSD, which may be 
related to LPS production as LPS has been shown to promote neurodegeneration [57].
3.8. HSD consumption induces inflammation in the nodose ganglia and withdrawal of 
sensory fibers from the hindbrain
We have previously found that HF feeding triggers vagal withdrawal from the NTS [58]. 
Moreover, our previously published studies show that damage to the subdiaphragmatic vagus 
triggers withdrawal of afferent fibers from the NTS and microglia activation in the NG and 
Dorsal Vagal Complex. [20, 22]. In the present study, using IB4 immunofluorescence 
staining, we found that vagal afferent density was decreased in the NTS in LF/HSD and 
HF/HSD rats, compared to LF/LSD rats (Figure 7A staining). However, differences reached 
statistical significance in the HF/HSD group only, showing that fats and sugars may both 
have an independent deleterious effect on vagal innervation (Figure 7A bar graph). 
Immunostaining against Iba1 revealed that HSD consumption, independently of fat and 
calorie contents, led to microglia activation in the NG but not in the NTS (Figure 7B and C). 
Thus, we concluded that loss of gastrointestinal vagal innervation may be responsible for the 
reorganization of vagal afferents in the NTS through the activation of microglia at NG. 
Alternatively, microglia activation may be directly related to gut dysbiosis as LPS and pro-
inflammatory cytokines have previously been found to induce glial activation [59, 60].

 Additionally, LPS has also been shown induce an inflammatory response in vagal afferent 
neurons in culture [61].
Similar to vagotomy, it is possible that inflammation-mediated damage to the gastric vagus 
system may reduce food intake and increase satiety signaling in these animals [62, 63]. 
Consumption of HF, highly palatable food in rodents has been shown to promote 
hyperphagia. The food intake in response to such diets can be divided into different phases. 
First, exposure to high calorie diets leads to immediate overconsumption during the first few 
days of exposure which is believed to be driven by the rewarding value of the palatable food 
[64]. Then rats and mice appeared to control their energy intake until the appearance of a 
hyperphagic phase after 4–8 weeks on the diet [13, 65, 66] which is associated with a 
decrease in peripheral, including vagal, satiety signaling [61, 66, 67]. We have observed 
marked changes in the microbiota composition after only 1 week on the LF/HSD and HF/
HSD; therefore it is possible that the initial hyperphagia may be a contributing factor in 
modulating the gut microbiome in the HF/HSD. However as previously described [13, 65, 
66] after this first phase, the animals were able to control their energy intake. Changes in 
microbiota composition have been shown to be very dynamic and detectable as early as 1 to 
2 weeks following changes in diet composition [68, 69] with some studies suggesting that a 
single meal could trigger compositional changes and increase endotoxemia [70, 71]. 
Therefore, it appears unlikely that the initial hyperphagia would have a lasting influence on 
the microbiota composition at week 4. If hyperphagia was the main driver of the week 1 
changes, one should expect that these alterations would be corrected by week 4, however in 
our study differences observed at week 1 were exacerbated at week 4. Furthermore, the 
LF/LSD displayed the same microbiota dysbiosis in the absence of hyperphagia. Therefore, 
the vagal remodeling we observed in this study seems to happen prior to hyperphagia and 
may be a necessary step in the development of obesity. Additionally, the vagus innervates 
most visceral organs bi-directionally and vagal efferent neurons located in the DMV can 
send motor information from the brain to the gastrointestinal tract [72, 73]. Therefore, it is 
possible that descending brain-to-gut communication is also compromised by dysbiosis of 
the gut microbiota impairing vagal efferent output and gut motility [74]. Because gut 
motility affects microbiota composition, alteration in vagal efferent output may play a role 
and/or worsen diet-driven dysbiosis. Remodeling of the vagal pathway may be directly 
related to the observed increase in fat storage. Earlier studies demonstrated that vagal 
pathways innervating the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and liver are involved in the control 
of assimilation, storage, mobilization, conversion, and oxidation of macronutrients [75, 76]. 
Lactobacillus has been hypothesized to modulate fat metabolism via a vagal-dependent 
pathway [77] and vagal ablation abolished -ornithine positive effects on lipid metabolism 
[78]. PPARγ signaling in NG has notably been hypothesized to regulate diet-driven 
thermogenesis [79].
Collectively, our study indicates that consumption of HSD, regardless of fat contents, 
induces microbiota dysbiosis, induces gut inflammation and alters vagal gut-brain 
communication. These changes are associated with an increase in body fat mass, 
independently of hyperphagia. Further studies are warranted to understand the precise 
mechanisms by which this chronic inflammation and altered gut-brain vagal pathway may 
lead to obesity.

 4. CONCLUSION
Summarizing the present data and considering our previous observations, we propose that 
ingestion of an HSD leads to changes in gut microbiota, which, possibly via an increase in 
LPS and inflammatory cytokines leads to withdrawal of vagal innervation in the gut and 
hindbrain. Dysbiosis-driven gastrointestinal inflammation could lead to an increase in gut 
permeability allowing passage of LPS and other pro-inflammatory signals from the lumen to 
the lamina propria. These pro-inflammatory products could trigger an inflammatory 
response in different tissues including microglia activation in the NG leading to vagal 
remodeling. We showed that increases in body fat mass are consistently correlated with 
microbiota shifts and altered gut-brain communication, however, the exact pathways remain 
unknown. Additionally, due to the presence of specific members of the microbial community 
(such as the bacterial family Sutterellaceae), HSD consumption may be a risk factor for non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

 Figure 1. HSD consumption increases body fat content
A–C. Daily changes in body weight (A), body fat (B) lean mass (C) of rats fed with regular 
diet (LF/LSD in blue), low-fat diet (LF/HSD in green) or high-fat diet (HF/HSD in red) for 
four weeks (n=4) shows that both HF/HSD and LF/HSD can significantly increase both 
body weight and body fat gains, compared to control LF/LSD. HF/HSD showed a significant 
increase in body weight and body fat within one week of diet introduction compared to 
control diet. Compared to LF/LSD, LF/HSD fed rats had significant increases in body fat 
after one week on their diet and significant increases in body weight appeared after three

 weeks. Significant differences in body fat between HF/HSD and LF/HSD appeared after one 
week on experimental diets while significant differences in body weight did not appear until 
after the second week between these two groups. Despite differences in body weight and 
body fat, lean mass did not differ between the three diet groups at any time during the 4 
week study. The vertical arrow after 3 days (day 0 on the graph) represents the point at 
which the LF/HSD or HF/HSD was introduced in two groups of rats. The third group was 
maintained on the same control LF/LSD throughout the experiment. Statistical significance 
was analyzed by repeated measures two-way ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer post-test between 
the groups. a,b,cMean values for week 4 with unlike letters (at the bottom of the graph with 
LF/LSD in blue, LF/HSD in green and HF/HSD in red) were significantly different (P≤ 
0.05).

 Figure 2. HSD consumption impacts energy efficiency
Average weekly Kcal per day consumed on diets (A), average Kcal intake from fat (B), 
average Kcal intake from sugar (C) and average Kcal to gain 1 g of fat (D) was plotted (as 
mean ± SEM, n=4) with each group of rats fed either LF/LSD, LF/HSD or HF/HSD for 4 
weeks. Summary results in bar graph show that, although the average weekly Kcal 
consumption between LF/LSD and HF/HSD were significantly different during the first 
week of diet changes, there was no significant difference after the second week of diet 
changes (Figure 2A). At the same time, although the average weekly Kcal consumption 
between LF/LSD and LF/HSD were not significantly different during the first week of diet 
changes, there was a significant difference after the second week of diet changes (Figure 
2A). However, the average weekly Kcal consumption between LF/HSD and HF/HSD were 
significantly different from the very first week of diet changes (Figure 2A). Similarly, the 
average Kcal intake from fat (B) was significantly higher in HF/HSD (P≤0.0001 compared 
to LF/LSD and LF/HSD), and the average Kcal intake from sugar (C) was significantly 
higher (P≤0.05) in both HF/HSD and LF/HSD. However, average calories to gain 1 g of fat 
(D) was significantly lesser in both HF/HSD and LF/HSD compared to control LF/LSD 
(P≤0.05). Statistical significance was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer 
post-test between the groups. a,b,cMean values at week 4 with unlike letters were 
significantly different.

experimental diets and Week 4 is after four weeks on experimental diets. All diet groups had 
similar species diversity at baseline. During the study period, both of the sugar-rich diets 
(LF/HSD and HF/HSD) led to a significant loss in species diversity.

Lactobacillaceae, E: Erysipelotrichaceae, A: Anaeroplasmataceae, D: Desulfovibrionaceae, 
B: Bifidobacteriaceae, V: Verrucomicrobiaceae. Overall, consumption of HSD, regardless of 
fat content, led to increases in members of the Firmicutes and decreases in Bacteroidetes. 
However, Lactobacillus, a Firmicutes of the Bacilli class, decreased significantly on HSD. 
The Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families of the Firmicutes class Clostridia 
significantly increased on the HSD. Micrococcaceae, genera of Actinobacteria, increased on 
HSD and more so on HF/HSD. LF/HSD specifically increased the Sutterella and Bilophila 
genera of Proteobacteria.
B. Cladogram produced from LDA score of 2.5 at Day 26 (See Supplementary Figure S5 for 
LDA Scores). Colors designate diet groups: Blue: LF/LSD; Green: LF/HSD; Red: HF/HSD. 
Cladogram reveals that LF/HSD and HF/HSD are characterized by abundant members of the 
Firmicutes class Clostrida. LF/HSD, in particular, is marked by the abundance of members 
of Proteobacteria, particularly the genera Sutterella and Bilophila.

 Figure 6. HSD intake modulates inflammation, tight junction integrity and vagal innervation in 
the gut
A. Effects of different diet on the nuclear translocation of NF-κB: Immunoblot analysis of 
isolated nuclear and cytosolic protein fractions from cecum were performed to determine 
NF-κB (p65) nuclear translocation and activation levels (total and phospho-). Actin and 
histone 3 were used as internal controls for the cytosolic and nuclear fractions, respectively. 
The representative figure of three different experiments shows that in both LF/HSD and 
HF/HSD the NF-κB nuclear translocation and activation was more than LF/LSD.
B. mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β and TNFα) in the cecum 
of rats fed four weeks with LF/LSD, LF/HSD, or HF/HSD were measured by real-time PCR. 
The results are indicated as a fold-change expression from the LF/LSD. Summary results are

ANOVA with a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc correction shows a significant increase in 
expression of IL-6, IL-1β and TNFα in HF/HSD and LF/HSD compared to that of LF/LSD 
(P≤0.05); a,b,cMean values at week 4 with unlike letters were significantly different 
(P≤0.05).
C–D. Immunoblot analysis (C) and quantification of immunoblot (D, the average 
densitometric analysis as compared with actin) with whole cell lysate from cecum using the 
occludin antibody show both HF/HSD and LF/HSD have significantly lower expression 
compared to LF/LSD (P≤0.05 compared to LF/LSD). Actin was used as internal control for 
the immunoblot analysis. All values were indicated as the mean ± SEM (n 
= 
4). a,b,cMean 
values at week 4 with unlike letters were significantly different (P≤0.05).
E–G. Immunoblot analysis (E) and quantification of immunoblot (F and G, the average 
densitometric analysis as compared with actin) with whole cell lysate from cecum were 
performed using the biotinylated IB4 and ß3-tubulin antibody as described in methods. 
Actin was used as internal control for the immunoblot analysis. All values were indicated as 
the mean ± SEM (n

4). The one-way ANOVA with a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc correction 
shows that both HF/HSD (P≤0.0001 for IB4; P≤0.001 for β3-tubulin) and LF/HSD (P≤0.001 
for IB4 and P≤0.0001 for β3-tubulin) have a significantly lower binding of IB4 and 
expression of ß3-tubulin protein compared to LF/LSD. a,b,cMean values at week 4 with 
unlike letters were significantly different (P≤0.05).
