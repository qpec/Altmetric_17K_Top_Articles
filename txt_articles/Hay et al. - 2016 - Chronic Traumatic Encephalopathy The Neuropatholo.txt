Abstract
Almost a century ago, the first clinical account of the punch-drunk syndrome emerged, describing 
chronic neurological and neuropsychiatric sequelae occurring in former boxers. Thereafter, 
throughout the twentieth century, further reports added to our understanding of the 
neuropathological consequences of a career in boxing, leading to descriptions of a distinct 
neurodegenerative pathology, termed dementia pugilistica. During the past decade, growing 
recognition of this pathology in autopsy studies of non-boxers who were exposed to repetitive, 
mild traumatic brain injury, or to a single, moderate or severe traumatic brain injury, has led to an 
awareness that it is exposure to traumatic brain injury that carries with it a risk of this 
neurodegenerative disease, not the sport or the circumstance in which the injury is sustained. 
Furthermore, the neuropathology of the neurodegeneration that occurs after traumatic brain injury, 
now termed chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is acknowledged as being a complex, mixed, but 
distinctive pathology, the detail of which is reviewed in this article.

INTRODUCTION
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a leading cause of morbidity and mortality 
internationally. In the United States alone, there are upwards of 2.5 million TBIs annually, 
with just less than 300,000 requiring hospitalization, and approximately 2% of the US 
population (approximately 5 million people) living with long-term disabilities as a

 consequence of a TBI (1–4). As a result, the estimated annual cost for TBI-associated health 
care in the United States exceeds $60 billion (5). Nevertheless, the evolving 
neuropathologies of TBI survival remain poorly described. In particular, the association of a 
history of TBI with neurodegenerative disease has, thus far, been based on observations from 
limited case-series, which often have incomplete clinicopathological correlations. As such, 
recognition of TBI-associated neurodegeneration in clinics and at autopsy is comparatively 
rare, with the consequence that the true prevalence and socioeconomic burden of these late 
TBI outcomes remain unknown.
In his observations on the punch-drunk syndrome in former boxers almost 90 years ago, the 
New Jersey Medical Examiner, Harrison S. Martland, described a constellation of 
neuropsychiatric and motor symptoms, together with limited autopsy data, observing
the condition can no longer be ignored by the medical profession or the public. It is 
the duty of our profession to establish the existence or nonexistence of punch drunk 
by preparing accurate statistical data as to its incidence, careful neurologic 
examinations of fighters thought to be punch drunk, and careful histologic 
examinations of the brains of those who have died with symptoms. (6)
Thereafter, throughout the twentieth century, reports of further isolated case descriptions and 
short case-series (7–10) reinforced Martland’s observations on the link between exposure to 
repetitive TBI in boxing and late neurodegenerative disease associated with a distinct 
neuropathology later recognized and termed dementia pugilistica (DP) (7). Perhaps because 
this condition was thought restricted to the uniquely brutal sport of boxing, DP garnered 
remarkably little interest, certainly not the formal studies called for by Martland to establish 
the incidence and describe the detailed neuropathology. However, during the past decade or 
so, with growing recognition of the neuropathology of DP in athletes who were not boxers 
(11–20), and in survivors of a single, moderate or severe TBI (sTBI) (21–25), there has been 
increasing acknowledgment that it is brain injury per se that is associated with the risk of 
late neurodegenerative disease, rather than it being a unique consequence of participation in 
a single sport. Hence, the current, more encompassing term chronic traumatic 
encephalopathy (CTE) replaces DP.
Inevitably, as reports of CTE attributed to a growing list of circumstances, in particular 
sports, have emerged in the media and in peer reviewed manuscripts, there has been growing 
public concern. However, although it is almost nine decades on from Martland’s first 
descriptions, we remain little further forward in understanding the true prevalence of CTE, 
and remarkably few cases have been described. Further, no robust and validated operational 
criteria for the clinical diagnosis of CTE have been defined. At present, the diagnosis of 
CTE rests with neuropathological assessment conducted at autopsy. However, validated 
operational criteria are in their infancy, and understanding of the complex of pathologies 
contributing to CTE continues to be expanded. This review describes our current 
understanding of the range of pathologies observed in survivors of TBI, and the potential 
pathological substrates linking TBI to this late neurodegeneration.

 TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND DEMENTIA
TBI is widely accepted as the strongest environmental risk factor for dementia (26–35). 
Indeed, not only is there evidence of a link between TBI and dementia, there is also evidence 
to support a dose–response relationship, with the risk of dementia increased in severe TBI 
versus moderate or mild TBI (34). However, much of the evidence supporting an association 
between TBI and the later development of neurodegenerative disease comes from 
observational and retrospective studies, and thus it may have been influenced by recall bias. 
The best current estimates suggest that between 5% and 15% of current cases of dementia 
may be TBI related (36), representing in excess of 675,000 dementia patients in the United 
States. However, as our appreciation of this link grows, and appropriately designed 
prospective studies report their findings, these figures undoubtedly will be revised.
Both historically and currently, TBI-associated dementia has been subdivided based on 
whether it follows an sTBI or repetitive, mild TBI (rTBI), with the associated clinical 
syndromes considered distinct. In particular, despite compelling literature to the contrary, 
there is a general presumption that CTE is limited to patients exposed to rTBI, most often 
athletes. This misperception may be due in part to a complete absence of comparative 
research or clinicopathological studies looking at material from both sTBI and rTBI patients 
in parallel. As such, considering late neurodegenerative outcomes from an sTBI and rTBI as 
different syndromes is, at best, premature and, arguably, flawed.
Following Martland’s seminal account of the punch-drunk syndrome, describing chronic 
neuropsychiatric sequelae and limited associated pathology in former boxers (6), multiple 
other reports followed and expanded on his findings. Of these, perhaps most enlightening 
were the observations by Roberts (37) on a cohort of 224 randomly selected professional 
boxers in which he reported that 17% displayed a “relatively stereotyped” clinical picture, 
comprising emotional lability, personality change, memory impairment and dementia, as 
well as pyramidal and extrapyramidal dysfunction, and cerebellar impairment. More recent 
descriptions of former nonboxer athletes (including from American football, ice hockey, and 
rugby) and military personnel have reported similar neuropsychiatric and behavioral 
problems, while expanding the descriptions to include aggression, poor judgment, 
depression, suicidal ideation, and, in some instances, suicide (17, 18, 39–41). Of note, these 
more recent case-series in nonboxer athletes report less prevalent motor symptoms than 
earlier reports of former boxers.
Studies reporting on dementia occurring following a moderate or severe sTBI typically 
describe the associated clinical syndrome as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in type (27–35), with 
only occasional studies formally recording a clinical diagnosis based on validated consensus 
criteria (28, 30–32, 34, 35). Notably, neuropathological confirmation that the pathology after 
an sTBI conforms to AD is lacking in these reports. Certainly, there have been no suitably 
designed, robust studies in the current era of understanding of the neuropathology of CTE 
that confirm the dementia occurring in late survivors of an sTBI is AD. In that regard, in 
contrast to patients with AD and no history of TBI, dementia in association with an sTBI is 
reported to feature prominent motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression 
and suicide (42, 43). As such, in cases where it has been evaluated in detail, the clinical

 syndrome of neurodegeneration following an sTBI echoes that of rTBI, and appears distinct 
from AD. Thus, the traditional view permeating the literature that an sTBI is specifically 
associated with the development of AD (44, 45) appears speculative, at best, and without 
confirmatory neuropathology.
CHRONIC TRAUMATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: A SPECTRUM OF 
NEUROPATHOLOGY OCCURRING WITH SURVIVAL AFTER TRAUMATIC 
BRAIN INJURY
Although Martland called for neuropathological assessment of DP in his original publication 
in 1928, it took until 1954 for the first formal account of the neuropathology of the brain of a 
former boxer to be described (46). Thereafter, several isolated case reports appeared during 
the following decades (9, 47–51), preceding the landmark observations of Corsellis et al. 
(52) on their neuropathological findings in a series of 15 former amateur and professional 
boxers. Although further studies on the material from this unique cohort followed, added to 
by many more studies both in boxers and, more recently, nonboxer athletes, this original 
publication remains informative. Of note, the picture that emerged from these original 
studies, and the observations made since, is of a complex of pathologies arising following 
exposure to TBI, whether repetitive or single, that might best be regarded as a 
polypathology. However, although increasing reports on the pathology of CTE are emerging, 
the often limited case numbers, biases in case selection, differences in methods, and the lack 
of matched-control observations create challenges in identifying informative pathology and 
in permitting comparative observations between rTBI and sTBI. The following account 
reviews the current understanding of the pathology of CTE and offers observations on 
priority areas requiring attention in future studies.
Macroscopic Neuropathology
A common observation in the early case reports of boxers was a degree of atrophy occurring 
in the cerebral hemispheres (9, 17, 46–49, 51–57) and cerebellum (51, 58), the former often 
showing preferential involvement of the temporal (59, 60) and frontal (9, 48, 50, 57, 60) 
lobes. In contrast, more recent reports on CTE in nonboxer athletes have documented 
relatively mild global atrophy, with the observation of a reduction in brain weight being 
made less consistently (11, 13–17, 39). Nevertheless, a pattern of macroscopic features, 
albeit relatively nonspecific, is emerging in studies on CTE in individuals exposed to rTBI, 
which encompasses atrophy of the mammillary bodies, a mild degree of ventricular 
enlargement (perhaps preferentially of the third ventricle), pallor of the substantia nigra, and 
thinning of the corpus callosum (46–49, 51–53, 56, 57, 59). In contrast to these observations 
in rTBI, formal reports of brain atrophy from autopsy examinations following survival after 
an sTBI are lacking. Notwithstanding this, generalized brain atrophy following an sTBI has 
been recognized, both at autopsy and in imaging studies, with the latter suggesting this 
atrophy continues beyond the acute phase and into longer-term survival (61–65). Further, as 
in rTBI, autopsy studies have reported notable thinning of the corpus callosum in a 
proportion of sTBI survivors at 1 year or more from injury (23).

 Beyond evidence of cerebral atrophy, a feature that has been described in a majority of cases 
following exposure to rTBI is abnormalities of the septum pellucidum, in particular cavum 
septum pellucidum (CSP), septal fenestration, or, in occasional cases, complete absence of 
the septum (9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 46–51, 53–59, 66–69). Although CSP has been reported in 
up to one-third of participants in population studies as being a normal finding (52, 70–73), 
evidence has suggested that there is both a higher prevalence and a greater extent of CSP in 
those exposed to rTBI (52). Further, imaging studies have confirmed CSP in vivo in boxers, 
with evidence in longitudinal studies supporting CSP as an acquired and evolving pathology 
(9, 50, 74, 75). In contrast to experiences in rTBI, to date CSP has not been documented as a 
specific feature in late survivors of an sTBI.
Microscopic Neuropathology
To date, some 150 or so cases have been reported describing the neuropathology of those 
exposed to rTBI from a range of sports—including boxing (22, 46, 52), American football, 
ice hockey, wrestling, soccer, and rugby union (11, 13–20, 40, 41)—and former military 
personnel (12, 19, 20), together with sporadic cases exposed to rTBI in other circumstances, 
including domestic abuse (58, 69, 76). Approximately 40 further cases reporting the 
pathology of survival after an sTBI have been described (21, 23, 77). However, although 
relatively small numbers of cases have been recorded in the literature, it should be noted this 
does not represent the entire world’s incidence of CTE during the period from the first 
clinical description by Martland or since the first pathology account in the 1950s. Instead, 
this represents recognized cases coming to autopsy, undoubtedly with considerably higher 
numbers either clinically diagnosed as an alternate dementia, such as AD, or not recognized 
as CTE during neuropathology assessment at autopsy. Notably, the pathology of CTE has 
been recognized only in circumstances where there has been exposure to brain injury, with 
this pathology featuring a range of abnormalities, including pathologies in tau, amyloid β 
(Aβ), and transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43); 
neuroinflammation; axonal degeneration; degradation of white matter; and neuronal loss 
(21).
Tau
Under the high strain rates encountered in TBI, mechanical breaking of axonal microtubules 
occurs, leading to transport interruption as a component of diffuse axonal injury (DAI) (78–
80) (Figure 1). This vulnerability of axons to mechanical loading arises as a result of their 
unique viscoelastic properties, in turn thought to derive from the biophysical properties of 
the microtubule-associated protein tau (80). Nevertheless, examination of tissue acquired at 
autopsy from patients dying in the acute phase after an sTBI (with up to 4 weeks’ survival) 
has revealed no evidence of immediate tau pathology (81). In contrast, where sought, 
abnormal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau is a constant in reported cases of CTE 
(22) and in a proportion of patients dying 1 year or more after an sTBI (21). Although the 
deposition of tau is a feature of a number of neurodegenerative pathologies and can be 
observed in normal aging, the pattern and distribution of tau pathology in CTE is sufficiently 
distinct to be proposed as pathognomonic. Specifically, whether in material from survivors 
of rTBI or an sTBI, this pathology is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal, 
hyperphosphorylated tau in both neurons and glia, showing a distinct perivascular

 accentuation and preferential involvement toward the depths of sulci in the neocortical gray 
matter (11, 17–19, 39, 40, 67, 82) (Figure 2). Typically, there is an irregular, patchy 
involvement within and between the involved cortical areas (17, 39, 40, 82). This pattern, 
originally observed by Geddes and colleagues (67, 82) in their description of tau pathology 
in boxers, has since been confirmed and refined in subsequent case-series, both in rTBI and 
sTBI, such that its appearance might be considered as defining CTE, when observed in the 
correct clinical context.
Remarkably, there remain just two cases, both former boxers, in which biochemical 
characterization of tau in CTE has been performed (55). In both cases, the 
hyperphosphorylated tau of CTE was indistinguishable from that observed in AD. When 
optimally assessed using immunostains for hyperphosphorylated tau (such as AT8, CP-13, or 
PHF-1), the neuronal tau pathologies appear as typical neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and 
pretangles that, beyond the perivascular accentuation and preferential involvement toward 
the depths of sulci, often show a distribution to superficial cortical layers (layers II and III) 
(39) in contrast to the involvement of deeper cortical layers that is more typical of AD. In the 
hippocampus, CTE is noted for the preferential involvement of sector CA2 by NFTs and 
extracellular tangles (Figure 3a), with NFTs and astroglial tau pathology also a feature in the 
hypothalamic region, in particular the mammillary bodies (39). Beyond these regions, there 
may be frequent involvement of deep gray nuclei and brainstem in the nucleus basalis of 
Meynert, substantia nigra (Figure 3b), locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, and tectum. In contrast, 
the dorsal striatum (the caudate and putamen) appears relatively spared, as too are the 
cerebellar dentate nuclei. In addition to neuronal tangle and pretangle pathologies, frequent, 
and perhaps distinctive, grain-like tau-immunoreactive profiles and neurites are often present 
in affected neuropil. Further, tau-immunoreactive axonal profiles are often observed in 
subcortical and midline white matter (Figure 3c,d). Finally, glial pathology is commonly 
observed as tau-immunoreactive thorn-shaped astrocytes located in subpial and perivascular 
locations in the neocortex and subependymally (39).
In relation to rTBI, these tau pathologies have been documented in virtually all cases. 
However, specifically for rTBI, there has been an unavoidable case-selection bias and a 
virtual absence of control material from uninjured cases in reports of CTE, rendering 
interpretations of the incidence of this pathology meaningless in the context of exposure to 
repetitive mild injury. In contrast, in the single study that looked at survivors of an sTBI, tau 
pathology was observed in up to 30% of patients at 1 year or more following injury, and this 
pathology was observed in greater density and in a wider distribution than in age-matched 
controls (21). However, as a retrospective archive-based study, no information was provided 
on the clinical status of these post-TBI tau-positive patients, hence, the clinical significance 
of the pathology identified at autopsy remains uncertain.
Regarding the hierarchical evolution of tau pathologies in CTE, putative staging protocols 
have been suggested by authors reviewing material from athletes after rTBI, and these range 
from restricted, focal, cortical pathology (stage I) to more extensive, widespread, cortical, 
hippocampal, and brainstem involvement (stage IV) (39). However, validation of this 
proposed staging, in particular clinicopathological correlation, has yet to be completed. Of

 note, the single study of a limited number of sTBI cases reported a hierarchy similar to that 
for AD (21), although this might reflect more limited anatomical sampling of the cohort.
Amyloid β
An early and consistent event in all severities of TBI, diffuse axonal injury results in 
cytoskeletal disruption with associated interruption of axonal transport (61, 83–85). In 
common medicolegal practice, DAI is sought by examining for evidence of transport 
interruption through the immunocytochemical demonstration of the abnormal accumulation 
of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in injured axons (83, 86, 87). Normally transported by 
fast axonal transport, following TBI, APP may be observed in damaged axons within hours 
of injury (Figures 1f and 4a). In addition, colocalizing with APP at these sites of injury are 
the enzymes presenilin-1 and β-site–APP-cleaving enzyme, which is required to cleave APP 
to Aβ (88–93). Thus, DAI creates an environment in which high concentrations of Aβ 
protein may be generated following TBI (93) (Figure 1g).
A hallmark pathology of AD, Aβ plaques are identified in autopsy material from up to 30% 
of patients dying acutely following an sTBI, and at higher density than observed in 
equivalent material from uninjured age-matched controls (Figure 5a) (24, 25, 94). Further, 
Aβ plaques can also be demonstrated in pericontusional, surgically excised tissue from sTBI 
survivors (94). Typically, these acute plaques are diffuse in nature and similar to those of 
early-stage AD. However, whereas plaques in AD are thought to develop slowly and occur 
predominantly in the elderly, TBI-associated plaques are detectable within hours of injury 
and across a range of ages, including in young adults. Notably, the appearance of these Aβ 
plaques in the acute phase might represent not only excessive Aβ genesis as a consequence 
of DAI but also the failure of normal Aβ-clearance pathways, which become overwhelmed 
by excess parenchymal Aβ production.
In the months following injury, evidence suggests that the normal order in amyloid cycling 
might be restored, with these acute TBI plaques clearing (92). However, in observations of 
material acquired at autopsy from people who survived 1 year or more after an sTBI, 
amyloid plaques were again observed in considerably greater density and in wider 
distribution than they were in material from age-matched uninjured controls (21). 
Furthermore, although the acute plaques following TBI are typically diffuse in nature, those 
observed in survivors of an sTBI are more typically neuritic in type (21), thus more 
reminiscent of plaques in established AD (Figure 5b).
In studies reviewing cases from the Corsellis Archive, Roberts and colleagues (53) observed 
the “occult aftermath of boxing,” referring to the often-abundant Aβ plaques identified in 
material acquired at autopsy from a cohort of 20 retired amateur and professional boxers. In 
this series, samples from all but one case contained diffuse amyloid plaque pathology; the 
exception was a 22-year-old former professional boxer who had had a 3-year career and only 
3 professional fights. Of note, however, the remaining 19 cases ranged in age from 53 to 83 
(median 65) years, thus arguably representing an older cohort. All NFT-positive cases in this 
cohort contained plaque. In contemporary descriptions of CTE in former athletes, Aβ 
plaques are often reported as a less consistent finding (39). However, where documented, Aβ 
plaque pathology is present in a majority of cases, the proportion increasing with advancing

 age (95). Hence, the current recognition of tau pathologies leading to putative CTE 
diagnoses in comparably younger athletes might underlie the occasionally misreported 
assertion that amyloid pathologies are absent or rare in CTE, when indeed they appear to be 
frequently observed in older and, perhaps crucially, clinically confirmed cases. In studies of 
material from patients with histories of exposure to rTBI, these Aβ plaques are almost 
invariably described as diffuse in nature (Figure 5c,d), in contrast to the neuritic plaque more 
often observed in long-term survivors of an sTBI. However, although much research 
attention is focused on tau pathology in CTE, comparatively little attention is directed 
toward amyloid pathologies.
Transactive Response DNA-Binding Protein 43
The 43 kDa transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a nuclear 
protein widely expressed throughout the body. However, under certain conditions TDP-43 
may translocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, forming polyubiquitinated and 
hyperphosphorylated pathological inclusion bodies; this abnormal TDP-43 is recognized as 
a major disease-associated protein in a number of neurodegenerative conditions, including 
frontotemporal lobar dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (96), and as a minor 
component of a variety of other conditions, including AD, Parkinson’s disease, and a small 
proportion of normal, aged individuals (97–99). Of relevance, animal modeling studies of 
TBI have suggested that axonal injury might upregulate TDP-43, leading to its translocation 
from the nuclear to cytoplasmic compartment (100–102). With recovery, TDP-43 is restored 
to the nucleus, suggesting this redistribution represents some form of acute-phase response 
(100, 101). Thus, there is the potential that TBI-induced axonal injury might influence 
neuronal TDP-43 processing.
In limited observations in CTE following exposure to rTBI, which included material from 
boxers and nonboxer athletes, neuronal cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions and distinctive 
grain-like profiles in the surrounding neuropil, where sought, have been documented in the 
hippocampus, temporal neocortex, and amygdala in a majority of cases (18, 39, 77, 103). In 
a small proportion of these cases, this TDP-43 pathology coincided with a clinical diagnosis 
of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, with the autopsy examination revealing features consistent 
with CTE (18). Based on these few observations, a diagnosis of chronic traumatic 
encephalomyopathy has been proposed (18), although it remains to be seen whether with 
further case experience this putative diagnosis will survive rigorous scrutiny.
In contrast to the similarities in pathologies in tau and Aβ in survivors of rTBI and sTBI, 
there is a notable difference in TDP-43 pathology. Specifically, following survival after an 
sTBI, although increased cytoplasmic immunoreactivity to physiological, 
nonphosphorylated TDP-43 has been observed in acute and late survivors (1 year or more 
after injury), abnormally phosphorylated TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions have not been 
reported to the extent or distribution beyond that seen in material from uninjured controls 
(77). This intriguing apparent difference in pathologies between survivors of rTBI and sTBI 
might suggest a physiological role for TDP-43 in the response to injury, which is somehow 
modified after exposure to repetitive brain injury, and thus precipitates cytoplasmic 
accumulation of hyperphosphorylated TDP-43.

 Neuroinflammation
Neuroinflammation is increasingly regarded as an important facet of the pathology of a 
range of neurodegenerative disorders (104–106), with neuroinflammation in AD recognized 
as an early event in disease pathogenesis (107–110). Of note, as regards TBI, studies 
exploring serum or cerebrospinal fluid from patients surviving an sTBI have reported 
elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels that correlated with poor neuropsychiatric 
outcome, including suicidal ideation (111–113).
Immediately following injury, TBI induces a complex neuroinflammatory response in both 
humans and animal models, a consequence of blood–brain barrier compromise, and an 
acute-phase inflammatory cell reaction featuring polymorphonuclear leukocytes, T 
lymphocytes, macrophages, and natural killer cells, together with activation of resident 
microglia (23, 114). Under normal circumstances it might be anticipated that this acute-
phase inflammation would resolve. However, in a proportion of survivors there is 
accumulating evidence that neuroinflammation persists beyond the acute phase (Figure 1j–
l). Examination of material acquired at autopsy from patients surviving an sTBI has revealed 
a remarkable and ongoing neuroinflammatory response in a proportion of survivors, even 
decades after survival following injury (Figure 6) (23). Intriguingly, although these 
observations noted florid neuroinflammation, with numerous activated microglia in the 
corpus callosum, in vivo positron emission tomography studies in surviving patients after an 
sTBI using the ligand [11C]PK-11195 have reported no significant differences in binding in 
this region, although they have reported a difference in binding in the thalamic region 
compared with control patients (115). As such, the possibility that imaging studies might 
considerably underestimate or misrepresent neuroinflammation following TBI could be 
considered. Of note, evidence of persistent inflammation in these imaging studies has been 
correlated with clinical evidence of impaired cognition.
In contrast to the limited, although detailed, studies of neuroinflammation following an 
sTBI, there has been comparatively little characterization of the extent and distribution of the 
neuroinflammatory response following rTBI, although neuroinflammation has been 
mentioned in several reports (47, 52, 56, 116). Further, numerous experimental models of 
rTBI have demonstrated persistent microglial activation after repetitive injury that has been 
associated with ongoing, degenerative pathology and evidence of cognitive deficit at up to 
12 months postinjury (117, 118).
Although neuroinflammation after TBI has been increasingly documented, it remains 
unclear whether this neuroinflammation is primary—representing dysregulated 
inflammation driving late TBI pathology—or secondary—responding to ongoing post-TBI 
pathologies. However, data from experimental models have suggested that the immediate 
microglial inflammatory response arising following TBI is of a mixed reparative M2a 
(alternative) and neurotoxic M1 (classic) phenotype that might then be switched to an M1-
predominant phenotype during the chronic phase (114, 119, 120). Whether the microglial 
responses in human TBI, in particular the phenotypic profiles in early-versus-late survivors, 
mirror observations from animal studies has yet to be confirmed.

 Neuronal Loss
In studies on tissue acquired at autopsy from patients who had sustained an sTBI, a degree 
of acute-phase neuronal loss has been documented (121, 122). Given the multiple acute 
pathologies of TBI, including diffuse axonal injury and the acute-phase neuroinflammatory 
response, this neuronal loss is to be anticipated. However, there is evidence suggesting that 
this neuronal loss might continue beyond the acute phase in a proportion of patients, with 
active degeneration of neurons via programmed cell death being observed in material from 
patients in a persistent vegetative state up to 1 year following a single, severe TBI, and this is 
accompanied by evidence of a continued reduction in hippocampal and thalamic neuronal 
densities (122–124).
Neuronal loss has been described in the majority of studies of boxers and nonboxer athletes 
with CTE, involving the neocortex, substantia nigra, locus coeruleus, and cerebellum (12–
16, 46, 48, 49, 51, 55, 57, 58, 68, 125, 126). Varying degrees of cell loss have been 
described, from widespread and diffuse to more patchy, or selective, changes. Of note, given 
reports of motor symptoms in CTE (in particular, Parkinsonian symptoms), although there 
have been reports of neuronal loss from the substantia nigra, this is typically accompanied 
by nigral NFTs, but synuclein-associated pathologies, including Lewy bodies, have not been 
a feature (13, 14, 46, 49, 52, 59). In contrast to rTBI, little is known about the vulnerability 
of the substantia nigra with survival from an sTBI.
White Matter Degradation and Continued Axonal Degeneration
As noted, a degree of DAI is regarded as a constant in all severities of TBI and is associated 
with cytoskeletal disruption and interruption of axonal transport, thus creating a milieu 
favoring rapid Aβ genesis in the acute setting (83–85, 88, 90, 91, 93). Since the earliest 
accounts of axonal injury after TBI, there has been an awareness that these white matter 
pathologies might continue beyond the immediate acute phase following injury (Figure 6). 
Specifically, using the Marchi technique, Strich (127) demonstrated evidence of ongoing 
myelin degeneration at autopsy up to 15 months after survival from a single, severe TBI.
As for progressive axonopathy after an sTBI, a swine model of DAI demonstrated that axons 
continue to degenerate months after injury (91), an observation subsequently supported in 
studies of patients surviving an sTBI, which show evidence of ongoing axonal pathology in 
a proportion of survivors, even decades after injury (23, 92) (Figure 1d). This progressive 
axonal pathology is characterized as morphologically abnormal APP-immunoreactive 
swollen axonal profiles in multiple regions (Figure 4). These profiles have been observed in 
isolation and as small clusters of somewhat granular axonal bulbs, indicative of disconnected 
axon terminals and providing evidence of ongoing axonal degeneration occurring with long-
term survival. In addition, in long-term survival in humans, this axonal loss in the corpus 
callosum was accompanied by a remarkable thinning of the white matter and diminished or 
abnormal myelin staining, which coincided with amoeboid microglia that contained myelin 
breakdown products, in keeping with ongoing myelin phagocytosis (23).
In contrast to current experience in sTBI, accounts of white matter pathology after rTBI are 
limited. While early reports did not seek specific evidence of axonal pathology, subsequent

 reports have described morphologically abnormal axonal profiles accumulating transport-
interrupted proteins, including phosphorylated tau (19, 39), although these reports have not 
characterized the extent and distribution, or made reference to controls or agonal state. As 
such, although these limited observations are noteworthy, the formal characterization of 
axonal pathology in rTBI remains to be pursued. Similarly, somewhat limited reports have 
described mixed observations regarding white matter pathology after rTBI, from foci of 
degeneration or rarefaction (12, 47, 56, 125), with reduced or patchy myelin staining (17, 47, 
48, 52), to reports suggesting no evidence of demyelination (49).
GENETICS
Despite axonal pathology and linked Aβ production appearing ubiquitous after TBI, only 
30% of patients develop Aβ plaques in the acute-phase following an sTBI (24, 25, 94), with 
a similar proportion of long-term sTBI survivors (21) and a majority of rTBI survivors (22, 
95) depositing plaques. Among the possible explanations for this variable response to injury, 
there may potentially be a genetic predisposition whereby some individuals cannot 
sufficiently clear Aβ during the acute phase, and others may slowly lose the battle to keep 
Aβ deposition at bay over a period of years after TBI.
APOE and Traumatic Brain Injury
Possession of the ε4 allele of the APOE gene has long been associated with an increased 
risk of AD (128, 129). Specifically, possession of the ε4 allele is associated with the 
incidence of Aβ pathologies in AD and also with age-related Aβ deposition in cognitively 
intact individuals (130). In TBI there is considerable evidence supporting an association 
between the APOE genotype and prognosis following an sTBI, with ε4 carriers 
demonstrating worse immediate and 6-month outcomes than non-ε4 carriers in a variety of 
clinical indices (131–140). Further, with a longer duration of survival, the influence of the 
ε4 allele appears to be synergistic with TBI, with individuals possessing this allele at greater 
risk of dementia following injury than non-ε4 carriers (30, 32, 34, 141–143). This contrasts 
with longitudinal studies on outcome in late survivors of an sTBI which, while confirming 
deterioration in measures of functional and cognitive outcomes over time, have reported no 
particular association with the APOE genotype; although the age at follow-up in these 
studies might be argued to be relatively young in comparison with studies reporting an 
association between TBI and dementia (47).
Regarding mild TBI, thus far there has been no convincing evidence of an association 
between the APOE genotype and injury risk (144, 145). However, it should be noted that the 
number of injury episodes in these studies has been small. In contrast, studies of longer-term 
outcomes after rTBI have reported that possession of the ε4 allele is associated with greater 
neurological impairment in high-exposure boxers (that is, those with more than 12 
professional bouts) (146) and poorer cognitive performance in older, professional American 
footballers (147). However, once again, the number of participants in these studies was 
small.
In relation to neuropathology, following an sTBI, individuals possessing the ε4 allele have 
demonstrated more severe contusional injury and show a trend toward more marked, diffuse,

 hypoxic brain injury (138). In addition, there is an increased incidence of amyloid plaque 
pathology in autopsy material from patients dying during the acute-phase after an sTBI 
compared with those who do not carry the ε4 allele (148). However, the association between 
APOE and late neuropathologies after an sTBI remains unknown. Although there are no data 
on the influence of the APOE genotype on acute pathology after exposure to rTBI, studies of 
its influence on late pathology after exposure to rTBI are informative. Original reports 
suggested that there is no particular association between the APOE genotype and CTE 
pathology as defined by characteristic tau deposition (11, 39). However, in an appraisal of a 
cohort of neuropathologically confirmed CTE cases, specifically those with Aβ pathologies, 
McKee and colleagues (95) reported a clear association between possession of the APOE ε4 
allele, Aβ pathologies, and more advanced disease.
Intriguingly, although the pathognomonic lesion of CTE has been proposed to be tau, and 
considerable attention in the literature has focused on CTE as a tauopathy, the limited 
clinical reports of outcomes after rTBI and of dementia after an sTBI suggest that possession 
of the APOE ε4 allele is associated with an increased risk of poor outcome. Further, in 
emerging pathology studies in CTE after rTBI, the APOE ε4 allele appears to be more 
closely associated with Aβ pathologies than with tau. Together these observations suggest 
that clinically relevant CTE might extend beyond being a pure tauopathy, with Aβ 
pathologies undoubtedly meriting closer attention.
Neprilysin and Traumatic Brain Injury
Neprilysin is recognized as the principal Aβ-degrading enzyme, with microsatellite 
polymorphism in the promoter region of the neprilysin gene (NEP) linked to amyloid 
pathologies, including AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (149–151). In TBI, a 
relationship between this GT repeat polymorphism and Aβ plaque pathology has been 
demonstrated at up to 1 month following an sTBI (152). Specifically, individuals carrying a 
longer repeat (greater than 41 total GT repeats) were at considerably greater risk of Aβ 
plaque pathology after TBI than those with shorter repeat sequences. These findings 
implicate neprilysin as having an important role in post-traumatic Aβ metabolism and 
plaque formation. However, although an increase in intra-axonal neprilysin 
immunoreactivity has been observed in association with Aβ accumulation at up to 3 years 
following an sTBI (92), the longer-term association between NEP and neurodegenerative 
pathologies after TBI remains unknown. To date, no studies of neprilysin and rTBI outcome 
or pathology have been conducted.
CONCLUSIONS
Almost a century on from the first clinical descriptions of the punch-drunk syndrome (6), 
several decades after the first comprehensive descriptions of an associated neuropathology 
(52), and with growing recognition during the past decade of the range of circumstances in 
which the clinical syndrome and pathology arise, there can remain no doubt that in some 
individuals exposure to brain injury is associated with later development of a distinct 
neurodegenerative pathology. Thus far, although remarkably few cases have come to 
attention, this neuropathology has been described only in autopsy material from individuals

 exposed to TBI, either as rTBI or as an sTBI. Regarding the former, exposure to rTBI is 
most often described in relation to sports-associated mild TBI, with the list of sports in 
which autopsy-proven CTE has been documented continuing to grow. As such, it is clear 
that it is exposure to TBI that is associated with the development of CTE, and not the sport 
or environment in which TBI is encountered.
The association between exposure to TBI and an increased risk of dementia is widely 
acknowledged. However, over the decades there has evolved an unsubstantiated view that 
dementia associated with exposure to rTBI represents CTE and is clinically and 
pathologically distinct from dementia that arises following exposure to an sTBI, traditionally 
regarded as AD (44, 45). Although studies in those exposed to rTBI have distinguished their 
cohort from the outset as former boxers, American footballers, or other athletes, and often 
are supported by neuropathological confirmation at autopsy, studies of dementia following 
an sTBI are typically retrospective clinical reports with no autopsy confirmation of 
diagnosis. As a consequence, the diagnosis of AD in these studies on dementia associated 
with an sTBI is subject to the same errors in reporting as dementia diagnosed without 
autopsy validation. Of note, in cases where careful clinical review of patients with AD has 
been performed, the clinical syndrome in those exposed to an sTBI has been reported as 
distinct from that in patients with no exposure to TBI (42, 43). Further, although hampered 
by small case numbers, varied methods, and the limited number of cases reported, when 
suitable data are available, the pathologies of survival from sTBI and rTBI appear 
comparable, and distinct from descriptions of existing neurodegenerative pathologies, 
including AD (Table 1).
Regarding this pathology, as more robust assessments emerge, it is becoming clearer that the 
neuropathology of survival from TBI is complex and multifaceted. An apparent constant is 
pathologies in tau, with a relatively stereotyped pattern and distribution proposed as 
sufficiently distinctive as to be pathognomonic. However, although tau pathologies have 
attracted attention, almost to the exclusion of wider pathologies, the complex of pathologies 
after TBI extends to include at least pathologies in Aβ and TDP-43, axonal degeneration, 
white matter degradation, neuronal loss, and persistent neuroinflammation. The significance 
of this complex of mixed pathologies to the clinical presentations of CTE remains to be 
established. Further, although there is emerging evidence on the potential contribution of 
genotype to the development of pathology after TBI, undoubtedly, greater efforts are 
required to establish risk factors for developing CTE including, but not limited to, the 
contribution of the severity and number of injuries, genotype, and the influence of comorbid 
pathologies.
Undoubtedly, to advance understanding of the part that TBI might play in precipitating this 
distinct, complex, neurodegenerative pathology, and to gain insight into the incidence, risk 
factors, and risk modifiers, concerted efforts are required to establish collaborative programs 
of research to document outcomes and, critically, neuropathology in survivors of TBI, 
regardless of the source of injury. Through these studies insight may be provided to inform 
strategies for prevention and much-needed robust, in vivo diagnostics. Until then, CTE 
remains an autopsy-defined diagnosis. However, despite remarkably few cases having been

 thoroughly evaluated neuropathologically, there can be no question that CTE is intimately 
associated with exposure to TBI.

 SUMMARY POINTS
1.
Exposure to traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with an increased risk 
of neurodegenerative disease.
2.
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), the pathology of neurodegeneration 
occurring after TBI, is a complex polypathology featuring tau as a constant, 
with abnormalities in amyloid β and TDP-43, axonal degeneration, 
neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and white matter degradation also being 
described.
3.
It is exposure to TBI per se that is associated with the risk of CTE, rather than 
the environment or circumstances of exposure.
4.
The clinical syndrome and neuropathology are comparable for survival after a 
single, moderate or severe TBI (sTBI) and after repetitive, mild TBI. 
Importantly, there are no neuropathological data to support neurodegeneration 
after an sTBI in Alzheimer’s disease.
5.
Global initiatives are required to support programs of research in survivors of 
TBI that are directed at documenting outcomes and, critically, the associated 
neuropathology.

 Figure 1. 
Proposed evolution of axonal and microglial pathologies contributing to late 
neurodegeneration following traumatic brain injury (TBI). In the intact, uninjured axon (a) 
microtubules composed of tubulin dimers bound by tau protein (h) transport cargo along the 
axon, including amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the enzymes responsible for its 
cleavage to amyloid β (Aβ) (e). As a consequence of dynamic stretch during injury, there is 
a change in the physical properties of tau protein, resulting in the mechanical breaking of 
microtubules, tau liberation, and its subsequent phosphorylation (i). At these sites of 
microtubule breakage, transport interruption follows, with the accumulation of transported 
cargo (f) resulting in axonal swelling (b), degeneration (c), and the liberation of large pools 
of Aβ, leading to plaque formation (g), a process that continues beyond the acute phase in a 
proportion of survivors (d). In parallel with this axonal pathology, there is a notable 
neuroinflammatory response marked by quiescent, ramified microglia (j) becoming activated 
(k); these activated and amoeboid microglia (l) persist beyond the acute phase in a 
proportion of survivors.

 Figure 2. 
Neocortical tau pathology in chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Tau immunoreactive profiles 
are distributed throughout the neocortex, although they typically show a preferential 
distribution toward the superficial neocortical layers and depths of sulci [a, 49-year-old male 
12 months following single, severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)], with a distinctive and 
characteristic perivascular accentuation of immunoreactive neurons and glia, whether 
exposed to repetitive, mild TBI (b, 56-year-old male, former rugby player) or a single, 
moderate or severe TBI (c, 48-year-old male 3 years following a single, severe TBI). The 
accumulations of subpial thorn-shaped astrocytes may also be observed (d, 59-year-old 
male, former soccer player). All sections stained for phosphorylated tau using antibody 
CP-13 (courtesy of Dr. P. Davies).

 Figure 3. 
Tau pathology in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In addition to neocortical tau 
pathology, tau-immunoreactive profiles are common in the hippocampus in CTE, with 
preferential involvement of sector CA2 by neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular tangles, 
as well as astroglial tau pathology (a, 59-year-old male, former soccer player). Elsewhere, 
tau pathologies are described in the deep gray nuclei and brainstem, where tau-
immunoreactive substantia nigra neurons and neurites may be present, together with a 
degree of pigment incontinence (b, same case as in a). Scattered tau-immunoreactive axonal 
profiles are also common in subcortical and midline white matter (c, same case as a; d, 60-
year-old male, former boxer). All sections stained for phosphorylated tau using antibody 
CP-13 (courtesy of Dr. P. Davies).

 Figure 4. 
Axonal pathology in the corpus callosum with varying durations of survival after traumatic 
brain injury (TBI). A constant in all severities of TBI is diffuse axonal injury (DAI) with 
associated interruption of axonal transport. In tissue sections, DAI is typically revealed by 
staining for amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is detectable in under an hour following 
injury as immunoreactive axonal profiles with varying abnormal morphologies (a, 18-year-
old male 11 h after severe TBI). Beyond this acute-phase axonal injury, evidence of ongoing 
interruption of axonal transport is marked by scattered, morphologically abnormal axons; 
staining for APP remains present in survivors 1 year or more after a single, moderate or 
severe TBI (b, 24-year-old male 8 years after a single, severe TBI) and in material from 
individuals exposed to repetitive, mild TBI (c, 59-year-old male, former soccer player). All 
sections stained for an antibody to the N-terminal amino acids 66–81 of APP (EMD 
Millipore).

 Figure 5. 
Amyloid β (Aβ) plaque pathologies following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Diffuse Aβ 
plaques can be identified in autopsy and surgical material from approximately 30% of TBI 
patients during the acute phase post-injury (a, 51-year-old male 24 h following severe TBI). 
In the following weeks to months, these diffuse plaques resolve, only to reemerge in 
approximately 30% of survivors 1 year or more after a single, moderate or severe TBI as 
both neuritic and diffuse Aβ plaques (b, 55-year-old female 47 years after a single, severe 
TBI). Aβ plaques are also present in a majority of cases of chronic traumatic encephalopathy 
following exposure to repetitive, mild TBI; these are typically, although not exclusively, 
diffuse in subtype (c, 60-year-old male, former boxer; d, 59-year-old male, former soccer 
player). All sections stained using antibody 6F/3D, specific for the N-terminal epitope of Aβ 
(Dako, Agilent Technologies).

 Figure 6. 
Neuroinflammation and degradation of white matter in the corpus callosum occurring with 
survival following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Material from approximately 30% of 
survivors at 1 year or more after a single, moderate or severe TBI shows evidence of white 
matter degradation as rarefaction in staining with Hematoxylin and eosin (d) when compared 
with material from uninjured controls (a). Accompanying this is evidence of ongoing 
neuroinflammation in the form of numerous amoeboid, activated microglia (e) in contrast to 
the quiescent, ramified microglia in uninjured controls (b). Staining for myelin with Luxol 
fast blue–Cresyl violet demonstrates an associated loss of myelin with evidence of continued 
myelin degradation after trauma (f). (a–c) Sections from the corpus callosum of a 38-year-
old male non-TBI control whose cause of death was sudden, unexpected death in epilepsy. 
(d–f) Sections from the corpus callosum of a 56-year-old male with 3-year survival after a 
single, severe TBI. (b) and (e) stained for HLA-DP, -DQ, and -DR using antibody CR3/43 
(Dako, Agilent Technologies) to reveal activated microglia.
