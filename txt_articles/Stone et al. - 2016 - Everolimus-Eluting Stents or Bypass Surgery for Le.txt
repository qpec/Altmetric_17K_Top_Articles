BACKGROUND
Patients with obstructive left main coronary artery disease are usually treated with 
coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG). Randomized trials have suggested that 
drug-eluting stents may be an acceptable alternative to CABG in selected patients 
with left main coronary disease.
METHODS
We randomly assigned 1905 eligible patients with left main coronary artery disease 
of low or intermediate anatomical complexity to undergo either percutaneous coro-
nary intervention (PCI) with fluoropolymer-based cobalt–chromium everolimus-eluting 
stents (PCI group, 948 patients) or CABG (CABG group, 957 patients). Anatomic com-
plexity was assessed at the sites and defined by a Synergy between Percutaneous Coro-
nary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) score of 32 or lower (the 
SYNTAX score reflects a comprehensive angiographic assessment of the coronary vas-
culature, with 0 as the lowest score and higher scores [no upper limit] indicating more 
complex coronary anatomy). The primary end point was the rate of a composite of death 
from any cause, stroke, or myocardial infarction at 3 years, and the trial was powered 
for noninferiority testing of the primary end point (noninferiority margin, 4.2 percent-
age points). Major secondary end points included the rate of a composite of death from 
any cause, stroke, or myocardial infarction at 30 days and the rate of a composite of 
death, stroke, myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven revascularization at 3 years. 
Event rates were based on Kaplan–Meier estimates in time-to-first-event analyses.
RESULTS
At 3 years, a primary end-point event had occurred in 15.4% of the patients in the 
PCI group and in 14.7% of the patients in the CABG group (difference, 0.7 percent-
age points; upper 97.5% confidence limit, 4.0 percentage points; P 
= 
0.02 for non-
inferiority; hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.79 to 1.26; P 
= 
0.98 for 
superiority). The secondary end-point event of death, stroke, or myocardial infarc-
tion at 30 days occurred in 4.9% of the patients in the PCI group and in 7.9% in 
the CABG group (P<0.001 for noninferiority, P 
= 
0.008 for superiority). The second-
ary end-point event of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven re-
vascularization at 3 years occurred in 23.1% of the patients in the PCI group and 
in 19.1% in the CABG group (P 
= 
0.01 for noninferiority, P 
= 
0.10 for superiority).
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with left main coronary artery disease and low or intermediate SYNTAX scores 
by site assessment, PCI with everolimus-eluting stents was noninferior to CABG with 
respect to the rate of the composite end point of death, stroke, or myocardial infarction 
at 3 years. (Funded by Abbott Vascular; EXCEL ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01205776.)

L
eft main coronary artery disease is 
associated with high morbidity and mor-
tality owing to the large amount of myo-
cardium at risk. European and U.S. guidelines 
recommend that most patients with left main 
coronary artery disease undergo coronary-artery 
bypass grafting (CABG).1,2 Randomized trials 
have suggested that percutaneous coronary inter-
vention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents might be 
an acceptable alternative for selected patients 
with left main coronary disease.3-5 Specifically, in 
the subgroup of patients with left main coronary 
disease in the Synergy between PCI with Taxus 
and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) trial, the rate of 
a composite of death, stroke, myocardial infarc-
tion, or unplanned revascularization at 5 years was 
similar among patients treated with paclitaxel-
eluting stents and those treated with CABG.4 
However, the outcomes of PCI were acceptable 
only in the patients with coronary artery disease 
of low or intermediate anatomical complexity.4 
Because these results represented a subgroup of a 
subgroup, they were hypothesis generating. More-
over, contemporary metallic drug-eluting stents 
have a better safety and efficacy profile than do 
the first-generation stents used in earlier trials.6,7 
Surgical techniques and outcomes have also 
continued to improve, and an evaluation of alter-
native methods of revascularization for patients 
with left main coronary artery disease is war-
ranted in a contemporary trial.
Methods
Trial Design
The design of the Evaluation of XIENCE versus 
Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness 
of Left Main Revascularization (EXCEL) trial has 
been reported previously.8 In brief, EXCEL was an 
international, open-label, multicenter randomized 
trial that compared everolimus-eluting stents 
with CABG in patients with left main coronary 
artery disease. Details of the organization of the 
study are provided in the Supplementary Appen-
dix, which is available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org. The protocol, also available 
at NEJM.org, was designed by the principal inves-
tigators and trial committees, in which interven-
tional cardiologists and cardiac surgeons were 
represented equally. The trial was approved by 
the investigational review board or ethics com-
mittee at each participating center. The trial was 
sponsored by Abbott Vascular, which participated 
in the design of the protocol and in the selection 
and management of the sites but was not in-
volved in the writing of the drafts of the manu-
script or in the management or analysis of the 
data, although it had the right to a nonbinding 
review. The principal investigators (the first three 
authors and the last author) had unrestricted ac-
cess to the data, were involved in the analysis 
and interpretation of the data, wrote the first and 
subsequent drafts of the manuscript, and made 
the decision to submit the manuscript for publi-
cation. The principal investigators vouch for the 
completeness and accuracy of the data and analy-
ses and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. 
The equipment and drugs used in the study were 
purchased by the participating hospitals.
Enrollment, Randomization, and Follow-up
Patients were assessed for eligibility at each par-
ticipating site by a heart team that consisted of 
an interventional cardiologist and a cardiac sur-
geon. Inclusion criteria were stenosis of the left 
main coronary artery of 70% or more, as esti-
mated visually, or stenosis of 50% to less than 
70% if determined by means of noninvasive or 
invasive testing to be hemodynamically signifi-
cant,8 and a consensus among the members of 
the heart team regarding eligibility for revascu-
larization with either PCI or CABG. In addition, 
participants were required to have low-to-inter-
mediate anatomical complexity of coronary ar-
tery disease, as defined by a site-determined 
SYNTAX score of 32 or lower9 (the SYNTAX 
score reflects a comprehensive angiographic as-
sessment of the coronary vasculature, with 0 as 
the lowest score and higher scores [no upper 
limit] indicating more complex coronary anat-
omy). Complete details of the inclusion and ex-
clusion criteria are provided in Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix. A cohort of 1000 con-
secutive patients with stenosis of the left main 
coronary artery of 50% or more, as estimated 
visually, who did not otherwise meet criteria for 
randomization, were enrolled in a screening reg-
istry during the initial recruitment phase of the 
trial and were followed through their initial treat-
ment to determine the applicability of the study 
results. The treatment these patients received was 
based on the assessments of all caregivers and 
on the personal preferences of the patients. Writ-
ten informed consent was obtained from all the 
patients.

of an interactive voice-based or Web-based sys-
tem in block sizes of 16, 24, or 32, with stratifi-
cation according to diabetes (present vs. absent), 
SYNTAX score (≤22 vs. ≥23), and study center. 
Twelve-lead electrocardiography was performed 
at baseline, within 24 hours after the procedure, 
at discharge, and at 1 year. Levels of the MB frac-
tion of creatine kinase were measured at baseline 
and at 12 and 24 hours after the procedure. Ad-
ditional electrocardiograms and biomarker mea-
surements were obtained to assess for recurrent 
ischemia or to evaluate adverse cardiac events. 
Clinical follow-up was performed at 1 month, 
6 months, and 1 year and then annually through 
5 years. The primary composite end point was 
assessed at a median follow-up of 3 years, with 
a minimum follow-up of 2 years for all patients. 
When the last randomly assigned patient reached 
the 2-year time point, an additional follow-up 
visit was performed to minimize bias and facili-
tate a more reliable ascertainment of the primary 
end point.10 Guideline-directed medical therapy was 
recommended for all the patients, and risk factors 
were managed as described previously.8 Routine 
angiographic follow-up was not permitted.
Revascularization Strategies  
and Medications
The goal of PCI was complete revascularization 
of all ischemic territories with the use of fluo-
ropolymer-based cobalt–chromium everolimus-
eluting stents (XIENCE, Abbott Vascular). The 
recommended technical approach to performing 
PCI has been described in detail elsewhere.8 Intra-
vascular ultrasonographic guidance was strongly 
recommended. The use of heparin or bivalirudin 
was allowed for procedural anticoagulation, and 
the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was 
discouraged. Dual antiplatelet therapy was initi-
ated before PCI and was continued for a minimum 
of 1 year thereafter.
CABG was performed with or without cardio-
pulmonary bypass according to the discretion of 
the operator, as described previously.8 The goal 
of CABG was complete anatomical revascular-
ization of all vessels 1.5 mm or larger in diam-
eter in which the angiographic diameter stenosis 
was 50% or more; the use of arterial grafts was 
strongly recommended. Epiaortic ultrasonogra-
phy and transesophageal ultrasonography were 
recommended to assess the ascending aorta and 
ventricular and valvular function. Aspirin was 
administered during the perioperative period, 
and the use of clopidogrel during follow-up was 
allowed, but not mandatory, according to the 
local standard of care.
Objectives and End Points
The trial was designed to determine whether PCI 
was noninferior to CABG with respect to the 
primary composite end point of death from any 
cause, stroke, or myocardial infarction at 3 years. 
Secondary objectives were to determine whether 
PCI was noninferior to CABG with respect to the 
rate of a composite of death from any cause, 
stroke, or myocardial infarction at 30 days and 
the rate of a composite of death, stroke, myocar-
dial infarction, or ischemia-driven revasculariza-
tion at 3 years. Additional secondary end points 
included the components of the primary end 
point, as well as revascularization, stent throm-
bosis, symptomatic graft stenosis or occlusion, 
bleeding complications, and a prespecified com-
posite of periprocedural major adverse events. 
Definitions of the end points are provided in 
Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix. Study 
monitors collected source documents of all pri-
mary and secondary end-point events for adjudi-
cation by an independent events committee. The 
extent of disease and SYNTAX score were as-
sessed at an angiographic core laboratory.
Statistical Analysis
We estimated that the random assignment of 
1900 patients would provide 80% power (at a 
one-sided alpha level of 0.025) to show the non-
inferiority of PCI to CABG with respect to the 
3-year primary end point, with a noninferiority 
margin of 4.2 percentage points for the upper 
97.5% confidence limit for the between-group 
difference in event rates, assuming an 11% event 
rate in each study group11 (with a minimum 
follow-up of 2 years and a median follow-up 
of 3 years) and an 8% rate of loss to follow-up or 
withdrawal from the trial. The noninferiority 
margin of 4.2 percentage points was agreed on 
by the study leadership of cardiac surgeons and 
interventional cardiologists as consistent with 
an interpretation of equipoise between the two 
treatments,12 given the lower periprocedural 
morbidity associated with PCI. Our original in-
tention was to randomly assign 2600 patients, 
which would have provided 90% power. Because 
enrollment was slower than anticipated, the sam-
ple size was reduced to 1900 patients for 80% 
power. The sponsor and study leadership were

unaware of the study results at the time of this 
decision.
With respect to the 30-day secondary com-
posite end point of death, stroke, or myocardial 
infarction, we estimated that the random assign-
ment of 1900 patients would provide 80% power 
(at a one-sided alpha level of 0.05) to show the 
noninferiority of PCI to CABG with a noninferior-
ity margin of 2.0 percentage points, assuming a 
3.0% event rate in each study group.11 With re-
spect to the 3-year secondary composite end 
point of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, or 
ischemia-driven revascularization, we estimated 
that the random assignment of 1900 patients 
would provide 99% power (at a one-sided alpha 
level of 0.05) to show the noninferiority of PCI 
to CABG with a noninferiority margin of 8.4 
percentage points, assuming a 22.0% event rate 
in each group.11 Hierarchical family-wise testing 
for the primary and first two secondary end 
points was prespecified to control the type I er-
ror (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).8
All principal analyses were performed with data 
from the time of randomization in the intention-
to-treat population, which included all patients 
according to the group to which they were ran-
domly assigned, regardless of the treatment re-
ceived. Sensitivity analyses were performed in the 
per-protocol and as-treated populations.8 Event 
rates were based on Kaplan–Meier estimates in 
time-to-first-event analyses. Noninferiority was cal-
culated with the use of the Com–Nougue approach 
to estimating the z statistic for the Kaplan–Meier 
failure rates, with standard errors estimated by 
means of Greenwood’s formula.13 In time-to-first-
event analyses, hazard ratios with 95% confi-
dence intervals were determined, and event rates 
were compared with the use of the log-rank test. 
Categorical variables were compared with the 
use of the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. 
Continuous variables were compared with the 
use of Student’s t-test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum 
test for non-normally distributed data. For supe-
riority, a two-sided P value of 0.05 or less was 
considered to indicate statistical significance. 
All statistical analyses were performed with the 
use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
Patient Enrollment
From September 29, 2010, to March 6, 2014, a 
total of 2905 patients with left main coronary 
artery disease were recruited at 126 sites in 17 
countries, including 1905 patients who were 
randomly assigned to a treatment group and 
1000 patients who were enrolled in the registry 
(registry patients). The CONSORT diagram is pro-
vided in Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix. 
During the initial recruitment period (the period 
during which the 1000 registry patients were en-
rolled), 747 of 1747 consecutive enrolled patients 
(42.8%) underwent randomization. The registry 
patients were at higher risk at baseline than were 
the patients who underwent randomization. 
Among the 1000 registry patients, 648 under-
went CABG, 331 underwent PCI, and 21 did not 
undergo revascularization. Thus, of the 1747 pa-
tients enrolled during the initial recruitment pe-
riod, 1078 (61.7%) were eligible for PCI and 1395 
(79.9%) were eligible for CABG. After enrollment 
in the registry was concluded, an additional 1158 
patients underwent randomization. Further de-
tails of the reasons for exclusion from random-
ization and patient characteristics are provided in 
Tables S3 and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Baseline Features and Procedures
Among the 1905 patients who underwent ran-
domization, 948 were assigned to the PCI group 
and 957 to the CABG group. Baseline clinical and 
angiographic characteristics were well balanced 
between the groups (Table 1). The SYNTAX score 
according to assessment at local sites was low 
(≤22) in 60.5% of the patients and intermediate 
(23 to 32) in 39.5% of the patients. The SYNTAX 
score according to the angiographic core labora-
tory analysis (Table S5 in the Supplementary 
Appendix) was low in 35.8% of the patients, in-
termediate in 40.0%, and high (≥33) in 24.2% 
and was slightly higher among the patients in the 
PCI group than among those in the CABG group. 
Distal left main bifurcation or trifurcation dis-
ease was present in 80.5% of the patients, and 
two-vessel or three-vessel coronary artery disease 
was present in 51.3% of the patients.
Among the 948 patients assigned to the PCI 
group, 942 underwent revascularization; PCI was 
the first procedure in 935 patients. A mean of 
2.4 stents with a mean total stent length of 
49.1 mm were implanted per patient; 99.2% 
of the stents implanted were everolimus-eluting 
stents. Among the 957 patients assigned to the 
CABG group, 940 underwent revascularization; 
CABG was the first procedure in 923 patients. A 
mean of 2.6 grafts per patient were placed; an

internal thoracic artery graft was used in 98.8% 
of the patients. Medication use differed between 
the groups. Additional procedural data and in-
formation on medication use are provided in 
Tables S6 and S7, respectively, in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.
Primary and Hierarchical Secondary End 
Points
The median duration of follow-up was 3.0 years 
(interquartile range, 2.4 to 3.0) in both groups. 
The results of the analyses of the primary and 
hierarchical secondary end points are provided 
in Table 2. The primary composite end-point 
event of death, stroke, or myocardial infarction 
at 3 years occurred in 15.4% of the patients in 
the PCI group and in 14.7% of the patients in the 
CABG group (difference, 0.7 percentage points; 
upper 97.5% confidence limit, 4.0 percentage 
points; P 
= 
0.02 for noninferiority; hazard ratio, 
1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 1.26; 
P 
= 
0.98 for superiority) (Fig. 1). The relative 
treatment effect for the primary end point was 
consistent across prespecified subgroups, includ-
ing the subgroup defined according to the pres-
ence versus absence of diabetes (Fig. 2).
At 30 days, the composite end-point event of 
death, stroke, or myocardial infarction had oc-
curred in 4.9% of the patients in the PCI group 
and in 7.9% of the patients in the CABG group 
(difference, −3.1 percentage points; upper 95.0% 
confidence limit, −1.2 percentage points; P<0.001 
for noninferiority). At 3 years, the composite end-
point event of death, stroke, myocardial infarc-
tion, or ischemia-driven revascularization had 
occurred in 23.1% of the patients in the PCI 
group and in 19.1% of the patients in the CABG 
group (difference, 4.0 percentage points; upper 
95% confidence limit, 7.2 percentage points; 
P 
= 
0.01 for noninferiority). The results of the 
analyses of the primary and major secondary 
end points were similar in the per-protocol and 
as-treated populations (Table S8 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Other Secondary End Points
The results of the analyses of additional second-
ary end points are provided in Table 3 and Fig. 1 
and have not been adjusted for multiple testing. 
There were no significant between-group differ-
ences in the 3-year rates of the components of 
the primary end point (death, stroke, and myo-
cardial infarction). At 30 days, the rate of the 
composite end point of death, stroke, or myocar-
dial infarction was lower among patients in the 
PCI group than among those in the CABG group 
(hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.88; P 
= 
0.008 
for superiority), which was driven by fewer myo-
cardial infarctions among the patients in the PCI 
group. In a post hoc landmark analysis of the 
period between 30 days and 3 years after ran-
domization to PCI or CABG, more primary end-
point events occurred in the PCI group than in 
the CABG group (Table S9 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Ischemia-driven revascularization dur-
ing follow-up was more frequent after PCI than 
after CABG (in 12.6% vs. 7.5% of the patients, 
P<0.001), although symptomatic graft occlusion 
after CABG occurred more frequently than defi-
nite stent thrombosis after PCI (5.4% vs. 0.7%, 
P<0.001). Major and minor bleeding events were 
also less common after PCI than after CABG.
Major periprocedural adverse events within 
30 days after randomization to PCI or CABG oc-
curred in 77 patients (8.1%) in the PCI group 
and in 220 patients (23.0%) in the CABG group 
(P<0.001); the lower rate of major periprocedural 
adverse events in the PCI group was due princi-
pally to fewer major arrhythmias, fewer infec-
tions that required antibiotics, and fewer blood 
transfusions among the patients in this group. 
Eighteen more deaths occurred after PCI than 
after CABG; these deaths were mostly from non-
cardiovascular causes (infections and malignant 
conditions), whereas cardiovascular mortality was 
similar in the PCI group and the CABG group. 
Additional details of major periprocedural ad-
verse events and adjudicated causes of death 
within 3 years after PCI or CABG are provided in 
Tables S10 and S11, respectively, in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
Discussion
In this large-scale randomized trial involving 
patients with left main coronary artery disease 
and low or intermediate SYNTAX scores, PCI with 
everolimus-eluting stents was noninferior to 
CABG with respect to the primary composite end 
point of death, stroke, or myocardial infarction 
at 3 years. The rate of the composite end point 
of death, stroke, or myocardial infarction within 
30 days after PCI or CABG was lower in the PCI 
group than in the CABG group, whereas fewer

Everolimus-Eluting Stents or Bypass Surgery
primary end-point events occurred in the CABG 
group than in the PCI group between 30 days 
and 3 years after the procedure. The 3-year rate 
of revascularization was 5 percentage points 
higher with PCI with everolimus-eluting stents 
than with CABG, whereas the rates of early myo-
cardial infarction and major adverse events — 
including bleeding, infection, major arrhythmia, 
and renal failure — were 15 percentage points 
lower with PCI than with CABG.
The results of the EXCEL trial suggest that 
PCI with everolimus-eluting stents is an accept-
able or perhaps preferred alternative to CABG in 
selected patients with left main coronary artery 
disease who are candidates for either procedure. 
An analysis of the screening registry suggests 
that approximately 62% of patients with left 
main coronary artery disease might be eligible 
for PCI, and approximately 80% might be eligible 
for CABG. Decisions with respect to revascular-
ization should be made after discussion among 
the members of the heart team and take into 
account each patient’s individual circumstances 
and preferences.16
In the SYNTAX trial, among 417 patients with 
left main coronary artery disease and SYNTAX 
scores of 32 or lower, the rate of the composite 
end point of death, stroke, or myocardial infarc-
tion at 5 years was similar among those who 
underwent CABG and those who underwent PCI 
with first-generation paclitaxel-eluting stents,4,17 
a hypothesis-generating subgroup observation 
that motivated the current trial. Since the time 
that the SYNTAX trial was conducted, changes 
in practice have occurred that would be expected 
to improve outcomes with PCI. In the EXCEL 
trial, we used everolimus-eluting stents almost 
exclusively; these stents are associated with a 
low rate of stent thrombosis.6,7 Definite stent 
thrombosis occurred in only 0.7% of patients 
within 3 years after the procedure and was less 
common than symptomatic graft occlusion. Con-
versely, in the SYNTAX trial, rates of stent 
thrombosis with paclitaxel-eluting stents were 
substantially higher and were similar to the rates 
of graft occlusion.18 In addition, intravascular 
ultrasonographic imaging guidance was used in 
nearly 80% of the patients in the PCI group in 
our trial, a practice that has been associated with 
higher event-free survival after left main coronary-
artery stenting.19,20 However, improvements in 
CABG have also occurred. Off-pump surgery,

arterial revascularization, and transesophageal 
ultrasonography were used more frequently in the 
current trial than in the SYNTAX trial,21 which 
probably contributed to the low rates of surgery-
related death and stroke that we observed.
The composite primary end point is sensitive 
to the protocol definition of myocardial infarc-
tion, which varied from the definition used in the 
SYNTAX trial and the Third Universal Definition 
of Myocardial Infarction.22,23 The study leadership 
of surgeons and interventionalists thought it 
important to use an identical definition of myo-
cardial infarction for both PCI and CABG to 
minimize ascertainment bias and to use a defi-
nition that is clinically relevant. The biomarker 
threshold chosen to indicate periprocedural myo-
cardial infarction in the case of both revascular-
ization procedures (a rise in the level of the MB

Figure 2. Subgroup Analyses of the Primary Composite End Point.
Data are shown as the number of primary end-point events per total number of patients in that subgroup and the event rate. Event rates were based on Kaplan–Meier estimates in 
time-to-first-event analyses. Hazard ratios are for the primary composite end point of death, stroke, or myocardial infarction at 3 years. The P value for interaction represents the 
likelihood of interaction between the variable and the treatment. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated by means of the Cockcroft–Gault equation. The 
Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) score reflects a comprehensive angiographic assessment of the coronary vascula-
ture, with higher scores indicating more complex coronary anatomy.

event ascertainment bias cannot be excluded. Sec-
ond, although the investigators recruited only 
patients with low and intermediate SYNTAX 
scores, 24% of the patients who underwent ran-
domization had a high SYNTAX score according 
to the angiographic core laboratory analysis. 
Although the results of the primary end-point 
analysis were consistent in this subgroup, fur-
ther studies are required to determine whether 
PCI is an acceptable alternative to CABG in pa-
tients with high anatomical complexity of left 
main coronary artery disease. Third, long-term 
medication use after PCI and CABG varied, 
which reflects differences in practice with re-
spect to the two revascularization strategies. 
Further study is required to determine the extent 
to which these differences contributed to the 
observed results. Finally, longer-term follow-up 
is required to examine whether additional differ-
ences between PCI and CABG emerge over time; 
a 5-year follow-up is currently being undertaken.
In conclusion, for the treatment of patients 
with left main coronary artery disease and low 
or intermediate SYNTAX scores, PCI with evero-
limus-eluting stents was noninferior to CABG 
with respect to the composite of death, stroke, 
or myocardial infarction at 3 years.
