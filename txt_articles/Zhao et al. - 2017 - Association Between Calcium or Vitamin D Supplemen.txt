 Association Between Calcium or Vitamin D Supplementation
and Fracture Incidence in Community-Dwelling Older Adults
A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
Jia-Guo Zhao, MD; Xian-Tie Zeng, MD; Jia Wang, MD; Lin Liu, MD
IMPORTANCE The increased social and economic burdens for osteoporosis-related fractures
worldwide make the prevention of such injuries a major public health goal. Previous studies
have reached mixed conclusions regarding the association between calcium, vitamin D, or
combined calcium and vitamin D supplements and fracture incidence in older adults.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium and
vitamin D supplements are associated with a lower fracture incidence in community-dwelling
older adults.
DATA SOURCES The PubMed, Cochrane library, and EMBASE databases were systematically
searched from the inception dates to December 24, 2016, using the keywords calcium,
vitamin D, and fracture to identify systematic reviews or meta-analyses. The primary
randomized clinical trials included in systematic reviews or meta-analyses were identified,
and an additional search for recently published randomized trials was performed from July 16,
2012, to July 16, 2017.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials comparing calcium, vitamin D, or combined
calcium and vitamin D supplements with a placebo or no treatment for fracture incidence in
community-dwelling adults older than 50 years.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent reviewers performed the data
extraction and assessed study quality. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate risk ratios
(RRs), absolute risk differences (ARDs), and 95% CIs using random-effects models.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hip fracture was defined as the primary outcome.
Secondary outcomes were nonvertebral fracture, vertebral fracture, and total fracture.
RESULTS A total of 33 randomized trials involving 51 145 participants fulfilled the inclusion
criteria. There was no significant association of calcium or vitamin D with risk of hip fracture
compared with placebo or no treatment (calcium: RR, 1.53 [95% CI, 0.97 to 2.42]; ARD, 0.01
[95% CI, 0.00 to 0.01]; vitamin D: RR, 1.21 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.47]; ARD, 0.00 [95% CI, −0.00
to 0.01]. There was no significant association of combined calcium and vitamin D with hip
fracture compared with placebo or no treatment (RR, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.39]; ARD, 0.00
[95% CI, −0.00 to 0.00]). No significant associations were found between calcium, vitamin
D, or combined calcium and vitamin D supplements and the incidence of nonvertebral,
vertebral, or total fractures. Subgroup analyses showed that these results were generally
consistent regardless of the calcium or vitamin D dose, sex, fracture history, dietary calcium
intake, and baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, the use of
supplements that included calcium, vitamin D, or both compared with placebo or no
treatment was not associated with a lower risk of fractures among community-dwelling older
adults. These findings do not support the routine use of these supplements in
community-dwelling older people.

pproximately40%of50-year-oldwomenwillhavema-
jor osteoporotic fractures during the remainder of their
lifetimes,1 and these fractures are associated with ma-
jor morbidity.2 Hip fractures are generally considered the most
serious type of osteoporotic fracture. A cohort study con-
ducted between 2000 to 2010 showed that more than one-
fifth of patients died within 1 year after hip fracture.3 Survi-

relatedfracturesworldwidemaketheirpreventionamajorpub-
lic health goal.
Practice guidelines recommend calcium and vitamin D
supplements for older people to prevent fractures in people
with osteoporosis. However, meta-analyses published to date
have not reached consistent conclusions regarding the asso-
ciation between calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium and
vitamin D supplements and fracture risk.4
Older people living in institutions such as nursing homes
andresidentialcarefacilitieshaveahigherriskoffracturecom-
pared with people living in the community.5 Therefore, the
association of calcium and vitamin D supplementation with
fracture risk may differ between community-dwelling men
and women and people living in institutions. In addition, trials
assessing calcium and vitamin D supplementation and risk
of fracture have recently been published and add to the evi-
dence base of the associations of calcium and vitamin D
with fracture risk. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-
analysis was performed to separately compare calcium, vita-
minD,andcombinedcalciumandvitaminDsupplementswith
aplaceboornotreatmentforfractureincidenceincommunity-
dwelling older adults.
Methods
This meta-analysis was performed according to the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions6 and pre-
sented based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Re-
views and Meta-analyses guidelines.7 The protocol for this
meta-analysis is available in PROSPERO (CRD42016053867).
Search Trials
We searched the PubMed, Cochrane library, and EMBASE
databases from the inception dates to December 24, 2016,
using the keywords calcium, vitamin D, and fracture to iden-
tify published systematic reviews or meta-analyses evaluat-
ing the association between calcium, vitamin D, or com-
bined calcium and vitamin D supplements and the
incidence of fracture. There were no language restrictions,
but the search was restricted to systematic reviews or meta-
analyses published in the last 10 years from December 24,
2006, toDecember 24, 2016, and excluded systematic
reviews or meta-analyses that included only populations
living in institutions (detailed search strategies are reported
in eTable 1 in the Supplement). We identified original ran-
domized clinical trials (RCTs) included in the systematic
reviews or meta-analyses. An additional search was per-
formed to identify recently published RCTs (from July 16,
2012, to July 16, 2017) meeting inclusion criteria, using the
databases and keywords described above.
Inclusion Criteria
Trials were selected based on the following inclusion criteria:
(1) RCTs comparing calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium
and vitamin D supplements with a placebo or no treatment
group; (2) trials enrolling adults older than 50 years and liv-
ing in their communities; and (3) trials providing fracture
data. Exclusion criteria were (1) randomized trials without a
placebo or no treatment group; (2) trials of participants with
corticosteroid-induced secondary osteoporosis; (3) trials in
which supplementation with calcium, vitamin D, or com-
bined calcium and vitamin D was combined with other treat-
ments (eg, an antiosteoporotic drug); (4) trials in which vita-
min D analogues (eg, calcitriol) or hydroxylated vitamin D
were used; and (5) trials in which dietary intake of calcium
or vitamin D (eg, from milk) was evaluated.
Risk-of-Bias Assessments
The methodological quality for the included RCTs was as-
sessed independently by 2 researchers (J.-G.Z., L.L.) based on
Cochrane risk-of-bias criteria,6 and each quality item was
graded as low risk, high risk, or unclear risk. The 7 items used
to evaluate bias in each trial included the randomization se-
quence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of par-
ticipants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, in-
complete outcome data, selective reporting, and other bias.
We defined other bias as trials sponsored by drug companies
and trials in which baseline characteristics were not similar be-
tween different intervention groups. The included trials were
graded as low quality, high quality, or moderate quality based
on the following criteria: (1) trials were considered low qual-
ity if either randomization or allocation concealment was as-
sessedasahighriskofbias,regardlessoftheriskofotheritems;
(2) trials were considered high quality when both randomiza-
tion and allocation concealment were assessed as a low risk
of bias, and all other items were assessed as low or unclear
risk of bias in a trial; (3) trials were considered moderate qual-
ity if they did not meet criteria for high or low risk.

 our outcomes of interest, we pooled them with the data
from primary trials.
The number of participants with hip fracture was the pri-
mary outcome because hip fracture can lead to more serious
consequences than other fractures for older people. The sec-
ondary outcomes were the number of participants with non-
vertebral fracture, vertebral fracture, and total fractures. Frac-
tures were defined as total fractures when they occurred at all
sites or when trials did not describe the sites of fractures in de-
tail.Ifatrialonlyreportedthenumberofparticipantswithfrac-
tures at a single site, such as hip fracture, we did not consider
it to be a total fracture.
Statistical Analysis
The association of calcium, vitamin D, and combined cal-
cium and vitamin D supplements with fracture incidence was
assessed, and each type of supplement was separately com-
pared with a placebo or no treatment group. We performed
meta-analysis to calculate risk ratios (RRs), absolute risk dif-
ferences (ARDs), and 95% CIs using the Mantel-Haenszel sta-
tistical method. If zero events were reported for one group in
a comparison, a value of 0.5 was added to both groups for each
such study. Based on the practice recommendation of the
Cochrane Handbook,6 trials with zero events in both the in-
tervention and the control groups were not included in the
meta-analysis when RRs were calculated.
Arandom-effectsmodelwasusedtopoolthedata,andsta-
tistical heterogeneity between summary data was evaluated
using the I2 statistic. Sensitivity analysis was performed by ex-
cluding low-quality studies, trials recruiting participants with
particular conditions, or trials with characteristics different
from the others.
When an inconsistency was detected between the RR and
ARD for the same outcome, we explained the results based on
theRRbecausetheRRmodelismoreconsistentthanARD,par-
ticularly for an intervention aimed at preventing an undesir-
able event.6,8
To evaluate whether the association between calcium,
vitamin D, or combined calcium and vitamin D supplements
and fractures was modified by clinical characteristics, we
specified subgroups based on dose and frequency of calcium
supplementation (≥1 or <1 g/d), vitamin D supplementation
(≥800 IU/d; <800 IU/d; intermittent high-dose given as once
every year; intermittent high-dose given as other frequen-
cies, including once every 3 or 4 months and once every 1 week
or month), or combined calcium and vitamin D supplemen-
tation; sex (women-only trials or trials that include both men
and women); fracture history (participants with a history of
fractures or other conditions, including participants with frac-
ture history in trials in which not all participants had a his-
tory of fracture before the start of the trial, no previous frac-
ture history, and missing fracture data); dietary calcium intake

Size of data markers is proportional to the weight of each trial. Risk ratios and
95% CIs were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method, with a
random-effects model used to pool data. Error bars indicate 95% CIs. Risk ratio
data are rounded to 2 decimal places; error bars reflect unrounded values. Trials
with zero events in both the intervention and control groups are not included in
the meta-analysis.

 evaluated calcium supplementation with or without vita-
min D for fracture prevention in older people.9-12 Seventeen
systematic reviews or meta-analyses evaluated vitamin D
with or without calcium for fracture incidence.13-31 Twenty-
five RCTs met the inclusion criteria from 21 included system-
atic reviews or meta-analyses. eTables 2 and 3 in the
Supplement summarize the RCTs included in the systematic
reviews or meta-analyses.
The searches for recently published RCTs yielded 1441 rec-
ords, and 53 full texts of these records were reviewed. Of these,
15 trials met inclusion criteria. After excluding duplicate trials,
33 RCTs32-64 involving 51 145 participants were ultimately in-
cluded in this meta-analysis (Figure 1). Hansson et al41 did not
report the residential status of participants, although a previ-
ous meta-analysis classified this status as community.12 The
trial by Hansson et al41 was included, but a sensitivity analy-
sis was performed that excluded that trial. Table 1 reports the
characteristics of the included RCTs. We excluded 38 trials for
the reasons listed in eTable 4 in the Supplement.
eFigures 1 and 2 in the Supplement show the assessment
oftheriskofbias.Allstudieswererandomized;25weredouble-
blind, placebo-controlled trials; 19 trials described an ad-
equate random sequence generation process; and 13 trials de-
scribed the methods used for allocation concealment. One
trial40 was low quality, 6 were high quality,54,56,58,61,63,64 and
the others were moderate quality. Inkovaara et al40 did not re-
portwhetherthedatarepresentthenumberoffracturesorpar-
ticipants with fracture (3 fractures in the placebo group, 1 frac-
ture in the calcium group, 1 fracture in the vitamin D group,
andnofractureinthecombinedcalciumandvitaminDgroup).
The data were included, but a sensitivity analysis was per-
formed that excluded that trial. We obtained unpublished data
for 6 trials51,52,58,61,63,64 from a Cochrane review.26 Two in-
cludedtrialsenrolled222participants,33,48accountingfor0.4%
of total participants, and reported that no fracture events oc-
curred in their intervention and control groups during the
follow-up period. Publication bias was not reported because
the number of trials reporting hip fracture (primary out-
come) was less than 10 for each comparison.
Calcium was administered as calcium carbonate in 14
trials33,35,40,44,47,51-56,58,60,62; calcium citrate in 3 trials46,48,57;
calcium citrate malate in 2 trials45,49; a combination of bicar-
bonate, lactate, and gluconate in 1 trial41; in combination with
lactate, gluconate, and carbonate in 1 trial42; and in unclear
form in 1 trial.39 Vitamin D was administered as vitamin D3 in
23 trials and vitamin D2 in 2 trials52,59 (Table 1).
Calcium Supplementation and Fracture Risk
Fourteen trials compared calcium supplements with a pla-
cebo or no treatment. As shown in Figure 2, there was no sig-
nificant association of calcium supplementation with hip frac-
ture (RR, 1.53 [95% CI, 0.97 to 2.42]; ARD, 0.01 [95% CI, 0.00
to 0.01]). There was no statistically significant association of
calciumsupplementationwithnonvertebralfractures(RR,0.95
[95% CI, 0.82 to 1.11]; ARD, −0.01 [95% CI, −0.02 to 0.01]), ver-
tebral fractures (RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.66 to 1.05]; ARD, −0.01
[95% CI, −0.03 to 0.01]), or total fractures (RR, 0.88 [95% CI,
0.75 to 1.03]; ARD, −0.02 [95% CI, −0.03 to −0.01]) compared
with placebo or no treatment. Baron et al47 recruited only par-
ticipants with a recent history of colorectal adenomas. A sen-
sitivity analysis in which the trias by Baron et al,47 Inkovaara
et al,40 and Hansson and Roos41 were excluded showed that
the results did not change (eTable 5 in the Supplement). There
was no significant association of calcium with fracture risk in

D with hip fracture (RR, 1.21 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.47]; ARD, 0.00
[95% CI, −0.00 to 0.01]) or nonvertebral fractures (RR, 1.10
[95% CI, 1.00 to 1.21]; ARD, 0.01 [95% CI, −0.00 to 0.01]), com-
pared with placebo or no treatment. There was no significant
association of vitamin D with risk for vertebral fractures (RR,
0.97 [95% CI, 0.54 to 1.77]; ARD, 0.00 [95% CI, −0.00 to 0.01]),
ortotalfractures(RR,1.01[95%CI,0.87to1.17];ARD,0.00[95%
CI, −0.01 to 0.01]).
Mitri et al62 included only participants who had a high risk
of diabetes; the TIDE trial32 included only people with type 2
diabetes and glycated hemoglobin concentration of 6.5% to
9.5% who were at risk of cardiovascular disease; the VitDISH
trial64 enrolled only participants with isolated systolic hyper-
tension; and the VitaDial trial34 included only people receiv-
ing hemodialysis (chronic kidney disease stage 5) with serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL. A sensitivity
analysis was performed that separately excluded the TIDE
trial,32 VitDISH trial,64 and VitaDial trial,34 as well as the trials
by Mitri et al62 and Inkovaara et al,40 and the results re-
mained unchanged (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Table 3 summarizes results of subgroup analyses for vita-
min D and the incidence of fracture. Vitamin D supplementa-
tion was associated with a significantly higher incidence of hip
fracture in participants with baseline serum 25-hydroxyvita-
min D concentrations of 20 ng/mL or greater (RR, 1.49
[95% CI, 1.03 to 2.17]; ARD, 0.00 [95% CI, −0.00 to 0.01]),
but interaction term compared with people with serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations less than 20 ng/mL was
not statistically significant. Intermittent high-dose vitamin D
given once yearly was associated with a higher incidence of
hip fracture (RR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.02 to 1.96]; ARD, 0.00 [95%
CI, 0.00 to 0.01]) (Table 3).
Combination Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation
and Fracture Risk
Thirteen trials compared results for participants receiving
combination calcium and vitamin D supplementation vs pla-
cebo or no treatment. In the Women’
s Health Initiative (WHI)
trial,55 36 282 women were randomized into 1 of 4 groups:
(1) calcium combined with vitamin D; (2) combined supple-
mentation with calcium, vitamin D, and hormone therapy;
(3) hormone therapy alone; or (4) placebo alone. In this meta-
analysis, only the data of the participants who did not receive
hormone therapy were pooled.65 Figure 4 shows results of
the meta-analysis. There was no significant association of

were not altered after excluding the trial by Inkovaara et al40
(eTable 5 in the Supplement).
The subgroup analysis did not show any significant dif-
ferences within subgroups based on the dose of calcium or vi-
taminD,sex,fracturehistory,dietarycalciumintake,andbase-
line serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (Table 4).
Discussion
Resultsofthismeta-analysisshowedthatcalcium,calciumplus
vitamin D, and vitamin D supplementation alone were not sig-
nificantly associated with a lower incidence of hip, nonverte-
bral, vertebral, or total fractures in community-dwelling older
adults.Sensitivityanalysesthatexcludedlow-qualitytrialsand
studies that exclusively enrolled patients with particular medi-
cal conditions did not alter these results. Furthermore, these
results were generally consistent regardless of the dose of cal-
cium or vitamin D, sex, fracture history, calcium intake, and
baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration.

 A meta-analysis by Tang et al10 reported that calcium
supplementation was significantly associated with preven-
tion of osteoporosis-related fractures. However, the report by
Tang et al included 2 large-sample cluster trials66,67 and did
not adjust for the number of participants, which might have
increased the probability of smaller P values and narrower CIs
between the intervention and control groups. Bolland et al12
reported that calcium supplementation was significantly as-
sociatedwithalowerincidenceoftotalfractureincommunity-
dwelling participants. Results reported here showed that cal-
cium supplementation was not associated with a lower rate of
hip fracture. In the current analyses, the point estimate re-
garding the association of calcium supplementation with hip
fracture was increased, but it did not reach statistical signifi-
cance. These results suggest the possibility of a significant as-
sociation of calcium supplementation with increased frac-
ture incidence, but the current analyses may have lacked
statistical power to show this association. However, the rea-
sonforthisassociationisunclear.Overall,resultsreportedhere
suggest that calcium should not be routinely recommended
for fracture prevention.
Prior analyses also reported favorable associations of high-
dose (≥800 IU daily) vitamin D supplementation and fracture
incidence.20,24 Bischoff-Ferrari et al24 found that supplemen-
tation with 800 IU or more of vitamin D per day was associ-
ated with lower rates of hip fracture and nonvertebral frac-
tures in adults 65 years or older. However, their findings may
havebeeninfluencedbyinclusionofthetrialbyChapuyetal,67
which only enrolled participants living in an institution. An-
other possible reason for differences in conclusions of earlier
meta-analyses and the current meta-analysis is that more re-
cently published trials reported neutral or harmful associa-
tionsofvitaminDsupplementationandfractureincidence.Re-
sults reported here showed that vitamin D was associated with
a higher risk for hip fracture, but this finding did not reach sta-
tistical significance. This finding may be attributable to lack
of statistical power in this meta-analysis.
Avenell et al26 performed a Cochrane review that con-
cluded that combined supplementation might be associated
with reduced incidence of hip fracture or total fractures. Bol-
land et al27 found that supplementation with combined cal-
cium and vitamin D did not decrease the incidence of hip
fracture or total fractures in community-dwelling individu-
als. In the current meta-analysis, data from the WHI trial
were updated compared with prior reports.55 The WHI trials
demonstrated a significant interaction of hormone therapy
for the association of supplementation with combined cal-
cium and vitamin D and risk of hip fracture (P = .01).65
Supplementation with combined calcium and vitamin D was
associated with lower fracture risk in participants who were
also taking hormone therapy. In contrast, supplementation
with combined calcium and vitamin D had no benefit in
women not assigned to hormone therapy.65 However, previ-
ously published meta-analyses did not exclude patients
receiving hormone therapy. In results reported here, data
were pooled for 7972 participants (4015 participants ran-
domly received combined calcium and vitamin D, and 3957
participants randomly received placebo) who did not receive
hormone therapy.
In the meta-analysis reported here, few included trials
specifically enrolled participants with established osteoporo-
sis, but some trials enrolled participants with risk factors for
osteoporosis, such as lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D con-
centration, low dietary calcium intake, previous fracture, and
postmenopausal status. A subgroup analysis based on adher-
ence was not performed in this meta-analysis because the
definition of adherence substantially differed between
included trials. A previous trial reported that calcium and
vitamin D supplements lowered fracture risk for individuals
living in residential institutions.67 These populations are
more likely to have osteoporosis because of their poorer
mobility, infrequent sun exposure, and poorer diet. For these
reasons it is possible that older people living in residential
care communities may benefit from calcium or vitamin D

 supplements.5 In summary, benefits of calcium and vitamin
D supplementation may differ between people living in the
community and people living in residential institutions.
This study has several limitations. First, RCTs from 21 pub-
lished systematic reviews and meta-analyses were identi-
fied, which might lead to the omission of trials meeting inclu-
sion criteria. Second, some included trials did not test baseline
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations for all partici-
pants. The subgroup results might have been different if all in-
dividuals were tested. Third, some RCTs were of poor quality
and,forexample,usedunclearallocationconcealment.Fourth,
the methods used to classify studies as high quality may have
been relatively lenient, and other researchers may have se-
lected different definitions for study quality.
Conclusions
In this meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, the use of
supplements that included calcium, vitamin D, or both com-
pared with placebo or no treatment was not associated with a
lower risk of fractures among community-dwelling older
adults. These findings do not support the routine use of these
supplements in community-dwelling older people.
