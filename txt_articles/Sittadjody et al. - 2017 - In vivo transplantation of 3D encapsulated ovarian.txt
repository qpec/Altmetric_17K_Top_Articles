Safe clinical hormone replacement (HR) will likely become increasingly important in the
growing populations of aged women and cancer patients undergoing treatments that ablate
the ovaries. Cell-based HRT (cHRT) is an alternative approach that may allow certain
physiological outcomes to be achieved with lower circulating hormone levels than
pharmacological means due to participation of cells in the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary
feedback control loop. Here we describe the in vivo performance of 3D bioengineered ovarian
constructs that recapitulate native cell–cell interactions between ovarian granulosa and theca
cells as an approach to cHRT. The constructs are fabricated using either Ca++ or Sr++ to
crosslink alginate. Following implantation in ovariectomized (ovx) rats, the Sr++-cross-linked
constructs achieve stable secretion of hormones during 90 days of study. Further, we
show these constructs with isogeneic cells to be effective in ameliorating adverse effects of
hormone deficiency, including bone health, uterine health, and body composition in this rat
model.

ancer therapies and the growing number of women
reaching the age of menopause have led to an increasing
prevalence in the loss of ovarian function, which has
profound health complications including sexual disturbances,
obesity, and osteoporosis1, 2. Pharmacologic hormone replace-
ment therapy (pHRT) with estrogen alone or estrogen and pro-
gestogens is known to effectively ameliorate these effects, but these
modes of pHRT are controversial and their use has decreased3, 4.
The decrease in use of pHRT is primarily an outcome of the
Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) studies of 2002 and 2004, which
indicated that adverse effects, including breast, endometrial, and
ovarian cancers5, 6 outweighed benefits such as reductions in
osteoporotic fractures7, 8. However, pHRT may have beneficial
effects9–11, in particular when delivered at an optimal dosage,
frequency, and appropriate time12. Thus, methods of HRT deliv-
ery that can maintain beneficial effects (e.g., enhanced bone
mineral density) with improved safety profiles (e.g., no increased
risk of cancer) are needed for the treatment of conditions asso-
ciated with loss of ovarian function such as osteoporosis.
Unfortunately, achieving the optimal dosage delivery of HRT is
challenging, owing to the complexity of the endocrine system.
Granulosa and theca cells of the ovary produce estradiol (E2) and
progesterone (P4) in response to follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary. The
secretion of LH and FSH, in turn, is regulated by gonadotropin-
releasing hormone (GnRH) produced by the hypothalamus.
Further, the hormones of the ovary (E2, P4, activin, and inhibin)
provide feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary, thereby
regulating their own production in the hypothalamic-pituitary-
ovarian (HPO) endocrine axis13, 14. Pharmacological approaches
to HRT lack integration into the hypothalamic-pituitary (HP)
components of the axis that would allow feedback and regulation
over dosage and timing of circulating hormone levels associated
with the delivery method. As such, pHRT methods exhibit dif-
ferent plasma concentrations of hormones from those associated
with functional ovaries, which may contribute to safety issues
associated with pHRT.
Regenerative medicine approaches that use cell-based hormone
replacement therapy (cHRT) offer a potential solution to tem-
poral control of hormone delivery and the ability to restore the
HPO axis in a way not possible with pHRT. We hypothesized that
by engineering a cell encapsulation process to more faithfully
recapitulate native ovarian structure, the key functional effects of
circulating hormones (which are sensitive to dosage and time)
could be achieved more effectively and safely than pHRT.
We

to
achieve
microencapsulation of ovarian cells that results in bioengineered
constructs that replicate key structure-function relationships

ovarian
follicles
(Fig.

In
this
report,
we
have
adapted
an
isogeneic
cell-based
construct to provide a proof-of-concept for the potential
benefits of cHRT.
Results
Construct preparation and evaluation. The fabricated constructs
(shown schematically in Fig. 1b) have distinct compartments for
the granulosa and theca cells as indicated by confocal microscopy
of the constructs containing specifically labeled cells (Fig. 1c). For
all in vivo studies, only isogeneic ovarian cell-based constructs
were used to demonstrate proof-of-concept, and the constructs
were implanted into omental pouches created in ovx rats.
Retrieval of the constructs at 90 days post-implantation showed
that the constructs remained in the omental pouch and that the
omental region around the capsules was well-vascularized
(Fig. 1d). In addition, we did not observe any evidence of

 fibrous encapsulation by either gross inspection (Fig. 1d) or
histology (Fig. 1e). The cells remained encapsulated as indicated
by phase images of the retrieved constructs (Fig. 1f) and also
maintained high levels of viability (Fig. 1g) over the time course
of the studies. Although we did not assess the degree of degra-
dation in the constructs, we believe that these observations are
consistent with the stability of the construct over the period of
experiment.
Plasma levels of hormones. A potential advantage of a cHRT
system is the ability of the construct to participate in the HPO
endocrine loop for regulation of plasma hormone concentrations.
In the first set of experiments with constructs in which alginate
was cross-linked with calcium ions (Ca++), we therefore assessed
circulating levels of 17β-estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4) (Fig. 2),
and gonadotropins (FSH and LH) (Fig. 3) after pHRT (implanted
subcutaneously) or cHRT implantations in omentum pouches
created in ovx rats. Untreated ovx rats (ovx with placebo pellets
not loaded with hormones in the case of pHRT, or animals
receiving empty alginate constructs and no cells in the case of
cHRT) and sham-operated (ovary-intact) rats served as controls.
To further investigate the ability of cells in the cHRT constructs
to secrete androgen precursors for estrogen or to participate in
the HPO axis, we also investigated plasma levels of testosterone
(Fig. 2e) and inhibin (Fig. 3e), respectively.
The pHRT treatment delivered by a subcutaneous route was
given at both low (10 µg/kg b.w.) and high (50 μg/kg b.w.) doses
of E2 either in the absence or presence of P4. These doses were
chosen based on previous studies16–18. Ovx rats that received
placebo pellets were used as negative controls, while sham-
operated ovary-intact rats served as positive controls. The pHRT
regimens used resulted in various plasma levels of E2 and P4
depending on the dosage given (Fig. 2a, b). Low-dose estrogen
formulations led to slightly elevated levels of E2 compared to our
bioengineered cHRT constructs (compare Fig. 2a with 2c), but
were still less than the hormone levels measured in ovary-intact
animals. The high-dose regimens led to supraphysiological levels
of E2 in the plasma, as indicated by values apparently above those
measured in ovary-intact animals (Fig. 2a).

 E2 and P4 levels in animals treated with our bioengineered
cHRT constructs did not reach the levels measured in ovary-
intact rats. Nonetheless, plasma levels of E2 and P4 in ovx rats
that received the bioengineered constructs were significantly
higher
than
levels
measured
in
untreated
ovx
rats
throughout the study period (Fig. 2c, d; p < 0.05 at all-time
points using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
Student–Newman–Keuls post hoc analysis).
We also evaluated the plasma levels of FSH and LH following
treatment of ovx animals with either pHRT or the bioengineered
constructs for cHRT (Fig. 3). Plasma levels of both FSH and LH
were found to be elevated in ovx rats due to the loss of negative
feedback control loop. Although P4 pellet implantation did not
exert any impact on the FSH levels, the implantation of E2 pellets
in ovx rats showed a dose-dependent suppression of the elevated
FSH. However, even the high-dose E2 (50 µg/kg) + P4 adminis-
tration did not completely suppress the elevated FSH levels to the
normal levels of ovary-intact animals (Fig. 3a). This is in contrast
to the cHRT recipients (Fig. 3c), in which FSH levels were
suppressed comparable to those of ovary-intact rats. The failure
of the pHRT treatment to normalize FSH levels is likely due to
absence of other regulators involved in the negative feedback loop
from ovarian tissues such as inhibin. On the other hand, the high-
dose 50 µg/kg E2 pellets with and without combination with P4, as
well as the low-dose 10 µg/kg E2 plus P4 schemes brought the
plasma levels of LH down to the level measured in ovary-intact
rats (Fig. 3b). However, there was only a slight decline in the
circulating levels of LH in the group that received P4 pellets alone
(Fig. 3b). Likewise, the group of ovx rats implanted with 10 µg/kg
E2 alone showed an intermediate response in the suppression of
LH. Even though the circulating levels of E2 and P4 in the ovx rats
that received cHRT constructs were found to be mid-way between
ovary-intact rats and ovx rats (Fig. 2), the full restoration of the
negative feedback loop is evident from the suppression of both
gonadotropins to the levels that are comparable to ovary-intact
rats by 3 weeks after implantation (Fig. 3c, d).
As shown in Figs. 2e and 3e, the plasma levels of both
testosterone (Fig. 2e) and inhibin (Fig. 3e) produced by the
cHRT constructs were intermediate between those of the
ovx and ovary-intact rats. The testosterone levels are consistent
with the levels of production of estrogen and progesterone. In
general, our data indicate that the cellular constructs are
producing additional hormones (inhibin) involved in the HPO
axis and androgens (testosterone) that serve as precursors to
estrogen production, a physiologic phenomenon not achievable
with pHRT.

 Body weight and fat accumulation. It is well known that loss of
ovarian function leads to body fat accumulation and body weight
gain19–21 as shown in Fig. 4 comparing ovary-intact and ovx rats.
We evaluated the influence of hormone supplementation by the
pHRT and cHRT constructs on body weight by weekly mon-
itoring, while fat accumulation and lean body mass were mea-
sured at the end of the study by using dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) imaging. Ovx rats receiving low-dose E2
alone or with P4 (Fig. 4a) and ovx rats treated with the cHRT
bioengineered constructs (Fig. 4b) had body weights comparable
to the levels in ovary-intact animals. Interestingly, the percent
body fat observed with the low-dose pHRT regimens was higher
than the amount observed with the cHRT bioengineered con-
structs (Fig. 4c). In other words, despite similar plasma levels of
circulating hormones, the cHRT constructs were able to achieve
substantially lower percent body fat levels than low-dose (10 μg
E2 ± P4) treatments. Furthermore, the body fat percentages in
animals receiving the cHRT constructs were not different from
ovary-intact animals (Fig. 4c). Consistent with observations in
other studies19, 22, the high-dose E2 (supraphysiological) admin-
istration (with or without P4) resulted in a greatly reduced body
weight compared to ovary-intact animals (Fig. 4c). There was no
difference between the effects of pHRT regimens (low dose or
high dose) containing estrogen and the cHRT treatments in terms
of lean body mass as determined by DXA (Fig. 4d), indicating
that the observed effect of estrogen deprivation on body weight
was related to fat deposition. We also note that whole body BMD
was substantially improved with our ovarian constructs compared
to ovx rats (Supplementary Fig. 1A).
Characterization of bone metabolism and architecture. Bone is
a major target organ of estrogens, and estrogen deficiency can
lead to osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteoporotic fractures in
pre- and post-menopausal women. We therefore assessed the
impact of our bioengineered ovarian cHRT constructs on circu-
lating biomarkers of bone metabolism, trabecular bone micro-
architecture, and bone mineral density (BMD). The systemic
influence of sex steroid hormones secreted by the ovarian con-
structs on bone metabolism is demonstrated by the fact that
plasma levels of osteocalcin (OCN) and c-telopeptide of collagen
(CTx) were substantially reduced in animals treated with the
ovarian constructs compared to ovx rats (Supplementary Fig. 1B,
C), as OCN levels in cHRT construct recipients were similar to
those measured in ovary-intact rats by 30 days (Supplementary
Fig. 1B).
BMD was determined by micro-computed tomography (µCT)
applied to the proximal femur at 90 days post-implantation.
Figure 5a shows a quantification of the femoral BMD for control
animals (ovary-intact or ovx) with comparison to the various
pHRT treatments or to our cHRT bioengineered ovarian
construct treatment. All treatment groups except P4 pellet

 implants alone showed substantial increases in BMD compared to
ovx animals, but none of the treatment groups had the BMD
restored to the level of ovary-intact animals. The cHRT
bioengineered construct recipients achieved BMD levels that
were not different from the high-dose E2 (supraphysiological) but
substantially greater than the levels attained with low-dose E2.
This is particularly striking given the fact that the bioengineered
constructs had lower circulating plasma levels of E2 and P4 than
both the low-dose E2 and the high-dose E2 pHRT regimens.
The micro-CT scans shown in Fig. 5b–i indicate differences in
the
bone
architecture
and
porosity
between
the
various
treatments. In particular, bone from animals treated with the
bioengineered constructs (Fig. 5i) showed morphology similar to
the native bone (ovary-intact animals; Fig. 5b), with the lowest
levels of porosity across the bone and regions of both cortical and
trabecular bone. Animals that received pHRT containing estrogen
(Fig. 5d, e, g, h), and particularly those receiving the high-dose
estrogen (Fig. 5e, h) showed thicker cortical bone than ovx rats,
but there was also demonstrable porosity in the trabecular region.
This observation may account for the measurements of increased
BMD in the 3D images of the µCT due to the higher density and
mineral content of cortical bone23. In short, although BMD levels
were similar for cHRT and high-dose estrogen pHRT, BMD and
porosity appear to be better for cHRT in the bone cross section.
Taken as a whole, the results shown in Fig. 5 indicate that the
cHRT treatment led to better bone outcomes (BMD and bone

Although the reason for the reduced levels of porosity achieved
with the bioengineered constructs is not clear, effects of other
cell-based products besides estrogen and progesterone may play a
role.

Changes in uterine morphometry. The loss of ovarian function
is known to have adverse effects on the genitourinary tract in
women, which can lead to sexual dysfunction, urinary incon-
tinence, and perturbations in the structure of sex organs24. The
uterus is one target of ovarian steroids and is very sensitive to the
levels of estrogens and progestins to which it is exposed. Indeed,
studies have shown that uterine tissue is susceptible to hyper-
plasia and hypertrophy when treated with estrogens25, 26.
Therefore, we evaluated morphometrical changes in uterine
tissue at the end of the study to determine the effects of both
pHRT and our cHRT bioengineered construct treatments on

 uterine morphology. Following euthanasia of animals at 90 days
after the treatment period (in ovx animals treated with pHRT or
cHRT), uterine tissue was excised from all groups of rats, weighed
and used for histological analysis. As shown in Fig. 6a, e, h, the
effects of the high-dose estrogen (50 µg E2 + P4) were profound,
leading
to
extreme
increases
in
uterine
weight
(Fig.
6a)
attributable to the hypertrophy shown in the gross images
(Fig. 6e, h). The low-dose estrogen pHRT (10 μg E2 + P4)
formulations (Fig. 6a, d, g) had virtually no effect on uterine
weight, compared to untreated ovx animals (6a-red color bar and
6d). In contrast, implantation of the bioengineered constructs led
to uterine weight demonstrably higher than the ovx animals
despite plasma hormone levels essentially similar to the low-dose
E2 pHRT (Fig. 6a gray color bar and 6i). Indeed, the uterine
weight achieved with the construct was not different from that of
the ovary-intact group. Also, in contrast to the high E2 pHRT
doses (50 µg E2 ± P4), no uterine hypertrophy was observed in the
bioengineered construct-treated animals (compare Fig. 6e or
6h to 6i for high-dose pHRT and the cHRT, respectively). In fact,
as shown in Fig. 6e, evidence of hyperplasia and possibly tumor
growth was observed with the high-dose estrogen regimens (50 µg
E2 ± P4), consistent with concerns noted in human patients on
estrogen therapy27, 28. These results from the high E2 pHRT dose
treatment groups are also consistent with previous reports from
animal studies showing extensive hypertrophied tissue formation
at high E2 doses29, 30 and highlight the challenges of balancing
safety and efficacy in pHRT treatments, albeit, our data generated
in a rat model remains to be validated in human studies. In
addition, since we did not assess the effect of an intermediate
estrogen dose regimen, it remains to be determined if such a dose
would eliminate the adverse effects of the high estrogen dose
observed in our studies in the ovx rat model.
Histological evaluations of the uterine tissue revealed that
bioengineered constructs (Fig. 6l) restored or maintained the
endometrial layer of uterus (noted as En in Fig. 6j through l) that
was atrophied in ovx rats (Fig. 6k) to an appearance essentially
similar to uterine tissue of ovary-intact rats (Fig. 6j). Importantly,

 constructs showed no signs of hyperplasia or hypertrophy. Taken
together, these results indicate that the levels of sex steroid

physiologically relevant. The implantation of the bioengineered

Approach to achieve sustained secretion of estrogen. At the
conclusion of the studies reported in Figs. 2–6, we observed that
plasma levels of E2 decreased over time beginning at about day 40
through the remainder of the 90 days period of study (see Fig. 2c).
Based on the results shown in Fig. 1d, we considered that one
possible reason for this decrease was calcification of the constructs
due to the use of calcium as the alginate crosslinker. To rectify this
problem, we conducted a follow-on study in which the alginate in
the cHRT constructs was cross-linked with strontium (Sr++)
rather than calcium (Ca++). In this second set of experiments, we
again used ovx rats as the negative control and ovary-intact ani-
mals as a positive control to maintain an internal reference to the
previous studies. As shown in Fig. 7a, and consistent with Fig. 2c,
estrogen levels declined over time when Ca++ was used as the ionic
crosslinker. However, the use of the Sr++ crosslinker abolished the
decline in estrogen levels that occurred between 60 and 90 days
after the Ca++ cross-linked construct implantations. The results
for progesterone, FSH, and LH in this follow-on study (Fig. 7b–d)
were consistent with those shown in Fig. 2d (progesterone), Fig. 3c
(FSH), and Fig. 3d (LH) with constant hormone production over
the course of time and no apparent change in the levels of these
hormones when strontium was used in place of calcium. Thus, the
replacement of Ca++ with Sr++ eliminated construct calcification,
as shown in the explant (Supplementary Fig. 2) and allowed

ovx rats that received cHRT constructs cross-linked with either Ca++ or Sr++. Following a decline in the levels of E2 observed in Fig. 2c, it was suspected that
calcification of the constructs as evident from Fig. 1d might be the cause. Therefore, the study (Figs. 2 and 3) was repeated by replacing Ca++ with Sr++ and
endocrine functions of modified constructs were assessed. The replacement of Ca++ with Sr++ improved the E2 secretion by the construct as is evident
from the sustained stable hormone release by the Sr++-cross-linked cHRT constructs (green) compared to Ca++-cross-linked cHRT constructs (yellow; see
also the green data points in Fig. 2c for cHRT constructs with Ca++-crosslinking). Each point represents the mean ± SEM of 10 animals (biological

 maintenance of the secreted levels of plasma estradiol (Fig. 7a).
We also note that the sustained levels of estrogen secretion likely
indicate minimal luteinization of the granulosa cells while sus-
tained LH levels indicate active theca cell function.
Discussion
Tissue or cell encapsulation may offer effective strategies to fab-
ricate ovarian constructs for the purpose of fertility and/or hor-
mone replacement. Approaches using segmental ovarian tissue or
whole-follicle implantation (typically with a focus on cryopre-
servation of the tissue for reproductive purposes) have resulted in
detectable hormone levels in the blood after transplantation31.
Previous studies have also shown that autotransplantation of
frozen-thawed ovarian tissue can lead to hormone secretion for
over 5 years in humans32, albeit, there is a possibility that those
individuals may have had some residual hormone secretion. Also,
whole-follicle encapsulation leads to the growth of antral follicles
and secretion of pre-ovulatory levels of estradiol33–35. It is well
established that high levels of estradiol secreted by pre-ovulatory
follicles induce LH surge via a positive feedback36, which in turn
would induce ovulation of the encapsulated follicles with con-
comitant luteinization of the follicular cells. Given the added
challenges of whole-follicle encapsulation for large mammalian
species37, cell-based approaches are appealing for hormone
replacement because of the ease of cell encapsulation. In addition,
a recent study has demonstrated that a bioprosthetic ovary cre-
ated using 3D printed microporous scaffolds restored ovarian
function in sterilized mice38. Although these approaches can be
used to achieve the dual purpose of fertility and hormone
replacement in premenopausal women undergoing premature
ovarian failure, they would have limited application in post-
menopausal women who only need hormone replacement to
manage menopausal symptoms and in whom fertility is not
desirable. In full development, the technology we describe in this
paper, which is focused on hormone replacement, would meet the
needs of the latter group of women.
Cell-based approaches have included encapsulated mixed cell
cultures39 or used co-culture approaches to ovarian cell encap-
sulation for cHRT15, 40, 41. Sustained hormone secretion in vitro
and in vivo40, 41 and amelioration of osteoporotic bone archi-
tecture in vivo39 have been reported. We have previously reported
the development of a 3-D cell encapsulation approach to mimic
native
structure-function
relationships
through
multilayer
bioengineered ovarian cell constructs as a means to deliver cell-
based HRT (cHRT)15. These multilayer constructs were shown to
have enhanced hormone secretion in vitro compared to co-cul-
tures, but the in vivo behavior of the constructs remained to be
determined. As a first translational step for this cHRT design, we
have investigated plasma levels of several ovarian hormones,
pituitary gonadotropins, and physiological end-organ effects of
the cell-based constructs.
For all studies in this report, isogeneic cells obtained from
donor animals were used to fabricate constructs that were
implanted in the ovariectomized rats of the same strain as the
donors. The construct presents differential compartmentalization
of the two endocrine cells, mimicking the native follicle. The
design shows two alginate layers (each containing a different cell
type) separated by a poly-L-ornithine (PLO) layer which could
provide immuno-isolation for the granulosa cells, but the prac-
tical purpose of this PLO coating was to provide a basement
membrane for the outer layer of alginate where the theca cells
were encapsulated. An additional outer coating with PLO on top
of the theca cell layer, which provides immuno-isolation for both
the granulosa and theca cells in the construct was added prior to a
final coating of the construct with alginate. Although we
investigated only isogeneic cell-based constructs, this design
could be used in the future to test the suitability of our cHRT
constructs with either allogeneic or xenogeneic cells since we and
others have previously shown that a PLO-coated alginate
microcapsule system provides immuno-isolation of both allo-
geneic and xenogeneic cells after transplantation42, 43.
In our studies, we compared the performance of the cHRT
constructs with an experimental pHRT treatment regimen in the
ovx rat model. There are numerous clinical delivery methods for
pHRT including oral, transdermal patches or gels, injections,
creams, and subcutaneous implants. While the pharmacokinetics
of these methods vary44, 45, the goal with these clinical approa-
ches is to achieve a steady-state concentration of the hormones in
the plasma in a range effective for an individual patient. Using
subcutaneous pHRT delivery we were able to achieve two dif-
ferent levels of circulating estrogen levels, which we have denoted
as low- and high-dose estrogen regimens. While the low-dose
estrogen is physiologically relevant, the high-dose is supraphy-
siological. Importantly, the low-dose regimen resulted in plasma
concentrations of estrogen and progesterone similar to those
achieved in other reports46, 47 and by our cHRT constructs,
allowing direct comparison of pHRT and cHRT. While the high-
dose regimen we used would not be clinically acceptable due to
safety issues, this dose has been used in previous studies to
achieve beneficial effects20, 22, and in our current studies has
demonstrated that supraphysiological plasma levels of estrogen
were required for pHRT to achieve benefits in bone health that
were comparable to those achieved by cHRT at much lower
plasma hormone concentrations.
The systemic effects achieved by the cell constructs were made
possible through their sustained sex steroid hormone production
along with their placement in the vascularized omentum. The
omentum is considered a clinically-translatable implant site for
implantation of tissue engineered constructs because of its vas-
cular supply to the implants48, as apparent in the engineered
tissue explants in our studies, and particularly, has been shown to
provide a better site, in terms of follicle survival, for intra-
abdominal ovarian cortex transplantation in the baboon com-
pared to other sites42. Plasma levels of E2 and P4 in animals
treated with our bioengineered constructs were not as high as
those measured in the ovary-intact rats. However, hormone levels
in the ovary-intact animals are of reproductive significance
whereas the goal of cHRT (or pHRT) is to achieve other phy-
siological benefits at the lowest plasma levels possible. The LH
levels measured after low-dose estrogen with progesterone pHRT
and cHRT construct implantation were equivalent to those of
ovary-intact animals, consistent with previous reports indicating
that E2 at low doses with P4 suppressed LH levels49. We note that
the FSH levels in ovx (no treatment) were approximately 2.5-fold
higher than ovary-intact in our studies, which used ELISA for
hormone measurement. Others have reported much higher FSH
levels after ovariectomy compared to ovary-intact rats in studies
using the more sensitive radioimmunoassay for hormone mea-
surement50. Thus, the disparity in the detection limits likely
explains the differences in the magnitudes of LH elevation fol-
lowing ovariectomy. Since ovarian sex steroid hormones are
known to be synthesized and secreted under the stimulation of
FSH and LH13, 14, the elevated levels of these gonadotrophins
after ovariectomy in the recipient rats could have acted as the
trigger for the secretion of sex steroid hormones from the
implanted constructs. It is also possible that even small numbers
of oocytes may play a role in granulosa cell secretion of estro-
gen51, but we cannot rule out the possibility that hormone
secretion may also occur in the absence of oocytes52.

cHRT constructs, though lower than the levels in ovary-intact

 rats, were effective in suppressing the levels of FSH and LH in ovx
rats. The increased levels of inhibin in the plasma of ovx rats that
received the construct implants validates our previous in vitro
findings of the secretion of activin and inhibin by the cHRT
constructs15. Given the known effects of estrogen and inhibin on
the hypothalamus secretion of gonadotrophin releasing hormone
(GnRH), our interpretation of these results is that the cHRT
constructs re-established the HPO axis in the ovx animals, in
contrast to the pHRT. It is presently unclear if other molecules
such as kissipeptin, which acts upstream of GnRH in the sex
steroid feedback mechanisms53, participate in the regulation of
the HPO loop mediated by our constructs. These observations
reinforce the notion that the concentrations of ovarian sex steroid
hormones secreted by the ovarian constructs were physiologically
relevant and achieved efficacious end-organ results at lower and
safer plasma levels. The secretion of other ovarian hormones (e.g.,
inhibin) as well as androgen precursors (e.g., testosterone) of
female steroid hormones by our constructs, which are not present
in pHRT regimens, has wider implications. For example, it has
been reported that osteoporosis associated with ovarian failure is
not solely due to the decline in sex steroids, but may also involve
decline in inhibins as well as elevated levels of FSH. Elevated FSH
following disruption of the negative feedback loop is known to
induce bone loss by increasing osteoclastogenesis54. The secretion
of hormones such as inhibin (Fig. 3e) may also explain our results
showing maintenance of low levels of FSH (Fig. 3c) despite
decreasing secretion of estrogen (Fig. 2c). These examples high-
light the significance of other hormones and factors secreted by
ovarian endocrine components, which can only be achieved
through cHRT.
The results of our follow-on study clearly show that the
replacement of Ca++ with Sr++ in the alginate crosslinking cor-
rects the problem of time-dependent decline in estrogen secretion
from the constructs seen in our first set of experiments where Ca+
+ was used for alginate crosslinking. We suggest a couple of
possibilities for the abolition of the time-dependent decline in
estrogen levels from constructs fabricated using alginate cross-
linked with Sr++. First, when Ca++ is used to crosslink alginate it
precipitates out of the hydrogel matrix over time with consequent
calcification of the constructs. Alternatively, it is possible that the
alginate matrix in the construct in which Ca++ is used for
crosslinking may provide a microenvironment with higher stiff-
ness55 than is appropriate for sustained function of the encap-
sulated ovarian cells, thus causing a decline in construct
performance over time. Although not tested directly, the results
with the Sr++ crosslinking in which estrogen levels were main-
tained at steady levels indicates that luteinization of the granulosa
cells did not occur56.
In summary the cell-based system of hormone replacement
described in this report offers an attractive alternative to tradi-
tional pharmacological approaches and is consistent with current
guidelines in the U.S. and Europe recommending the lowest
possible doses of hormone for replacement therapy57, 58. In our
studies plasma levels of estrogen and progesterone (from our
cHRT constructs) similar to the recommended levels led to
improved end-organ outcomes, thus demonstrating the ability of
cHRT constructs to achieve the desired benefits. Sustained
stable hormone release over the course of 90 days of study
was demonstrated by our constructs when using the Sr++
crosslinker. We also demonstrated effective end-organ outcomes
in body fat composition, uterine health, and bone health. How-
ever, additional studies will be required to determine the
sustainability of the hormone secretion of the Sr++-cross-linked
constructs
by
measuring
hormone
levels
from
implanted
constructs for periods longer than 3 months such as 6–12 months
in the rat model.
In conclusion, this study highlights the potential utility of
cHRT for the treatment and study of conditions associated with
functional loss of the ovaries. Although longer-term studies
would be of future interest, the 90-day duration of this rodent
model study is consistent with others investigating osteoporosis
in an ovariectomy model59–62. However, while our study provides
a proof-of-concept for cHRT, it suffers the limitation that it is
only an isogeneic-based construct implantation. We concede that
further studies in either allogeneic or xenogeneic settings would
be required with the construct design described in this report in
the path towards clinical translation given that patients who
would receive this type of treatment are unlikely to have sufficient
autologous ovarian cells for transplantation.
Methods
Animals. All animal studies were conducted with the approval of the Wake Forest
University Health Sciences Animal Care and Use Committee. Female Fischer 344
rats purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley Inc. (Indianapolis, IN) were used in
this study. 21-day old immature female rats were used as donors for the isolation of
granulosa and theca cells, while 3-month old mature female rats served as
bioengineered ovarian cell construct recipients. These studies were conducted with
3 cohorts of animals with a total of 14 treatment groups. All 3 cohorts had sham-
operated ovary-intact rats and ovariectomized (ovx) rats as internal cohort con-
trols. The first cohort consisted of seven groups, including the following (1) sham-
operated ovary-intact rats, (2) ovx rats, (3) progesterone only (2 mg/kg), (4) low-
dose estrogen (10 μg/kg), (e5) low-dose estrogen (10 μg/kg) with progesterone (2
mg/kg), (6) high-dose estrogen (50 μg/kg) estrogen or (7) high-dose estrogen (50
μg/kg) with progesterone (2 mg/kg). All animals receiving pHRT treatments in the
first cohort (listed 3–7above) received the hormones via a subcutaneously
implanted pellet as described below and the ovx animals received placebo sub-
cutaneous pellets instead of pellets loaded with hormone. The second cohort
consisted of 3 groups, including (1) sham-operated ovary-intact rats, (2) ovx rats
that received blank capsules without any cells, (3) ovx rats implanted with con-
structs in which alginate was cross-linked with Ca++. The third cohort consisted of
four groups including: (1) sham-operated ovary-intact rats; (2) ovx rats that
received blank capsules without any cells; (3) ovx rats implanted with constructs in
which alginate was cross-linked with Ca++; or (4) ovx rats implanted with con-
structs using Sr++-cross-linked alginate. Animals that exhibited any unrelated
pathological conditions that would have affected the study outcome were excluded
from the study based on pre-established conditions included in the original animal
protocol.
Materials. Medium 199 and McCoy’s 5 A media were purchased from Gibco-BRL
(Life Technologies/Gibco-BRL, Grand Island, NY). Percoll, FSH, LH, insulin-
transferrin-selenium mix (ITS), deoxyribonuclease I (DNase 1), poly-L-ornithine
(PLO molecular weight 15–30 KDa) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO). Low viscosity (20–200 mPa·s) ultra-pure sodium alginate with high
mannuronic acid (LVM) content and with high guluronic acid (LVG) were pur-
chased from Nova-Matrix (Sandvika, Norway). Collagenase type 1 was from
Worthington (Lakewood, NJ) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) from
Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Solutions for alginate microcapsule synthesis were
made using the following chemicals: HEPES, sodium chloride, calcium chloride,
and strontium chloride (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The vendors for other
chemicals, reagents, assay kits and antibodies used have been indicated in the
relevant areas of this method section.
Cells isolation and purification. The endocrine cells were isolated from
ovaries of immature rats15. The ovaries collected in ice-cold medium 199 (M199)
[containing HEPES (25 mM), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), L-glutamine
(2 mM), penicillin (10, 000 IU/ml), streptomycin (10, 000 µg/ml), and amphoter-
icin B (25 µg/ml)] were cleansed of extraneous tissues, washed twice with ice-cold
M199 and punctured gently with 27 G syringe needles in order to release the
loosely packed granulosa from the follicles; cells thus collected were kept on ice.
The remaining ovaries were chopped into fine pieces of ~ 0.25 mm2 and the cells
released during this process were also collected and kept separately on ice. The
pieces of ovaries were then incubated with collagenase (2 mg/ml) and DNase (10
µg/ml) in M199 for 90 min with occasional mixing. The enzyme-digested pieces
were dispersed by using a Pasteur pipette to obtain a single cell suspension and
stored on ice as a separate fraction. Using different fractions collected from the
above mentioned steps granulosa and theca cells were purified by a discontinuous
Percoll gradient separation and the purity of each cell type was assessed by flow
cytometric analysis using cell-specific markers (CYP19 for granulosa cells and
CYP17A1 for theca cells). The viability of the cells assessed using the Trypan blue
method was found to be between 85–95%, indicating only little batch-to-batch
variability.

 Culture of granulosa and theca cells. Purified granulosa and theca cells were
cultured in McCoy’s 5 A medium [with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mg/ml BSA, 10,000
IU/ml penicillin, 10,000 µg/ml streptomycin, 25 µg/ml amphotericin B, ITS (10 µg/
ml insulin; 5.5 µg/ml transferrin; 5 ng/ml selenium; 0.5 mg/ml BSA;
4.7 µg/ml linoleic acid) and 10 nM IGF-I] with supplementation of different hor-
mones to maintain their respective phenotypes. While the media for granulosa cell
culture were supplemented with 50 ng/ml FSH and 100 nM E2 the media for theca
cells were supplemented with 50 ng/ml LH and cultured at 37 °C under an
atmosphere of 5% CO2 in humidified air until they reached 80%–90% confluency.
Upon reaching 80%–90% confluent stage (~ 96 h), the granulosa and theca cells
were lifted from the culture flask with a cell scrapper and used for studies.
Ovarian tissue-construct encapsulation. The ovarian tissue-constructs that
mimic the follicular architecture were fabricated by using encapsulation techni-
ques15. Briefly, for fabricating the cHRT construct, first the granulosa cells were
encapsulated in 1.5% (w/v) ultra-pure low viscosity mannuronic acid (up-LVM)
and coated with 0.1% (w/v) poly-L-ornithine (PLO) for 20 min. The PLO-coated
microcapsules were then mixed with theca cells suspended in 1.5% (w/v) up-LVM
and encapsulated again using the micro-fluidic device in order to obtain double
alginate-layered microcapsules. An additional layer of PLO followed by a layer of
0.5% (w/v) ultra-pure low viscosity guluronic acid (up-LVG) purchased from
Nova-Matrix (Sandvika, Norway) were then applied on the periphery. The addi-
tional layers of PLO and alginate were included as this design would be appropriate
for immune-isolation of the encapsulated theca cells in the external compartment
of the construct (Fig. 1b) should allogeneic or xenogeneic cells be used. The cHRT
construct design has structural architecture resembling that of native follicles as
illustrated in Fig. 1a. The differential distribution of ovarian endocrine cells in the
multi-layered microcapsules was demonstrated by encapsulating pre-staining
granulosa and theca cells with Cell Tracker green and Cell-tracker Orange (Life
Technologies/Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), respectively. The multilayer micro-
capsules were then imaged by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM510) to visualize the
compartmentalization of each cell type, as depicted in Fig. 1c.
Bilateral ovariectomy transplantation of bioengineered ovarian cell constructs
or delivery of pharmacological HRT. Female Fisher 344 rats aged 3 months
(weighing 208.2 ± 19.7 g) were subjected to bilateral ovariectomy (ovx). Blood
samples were collected weekly (between 8 and 11 am) in order to follow the
changes in plasma levels of E2, P4, FSH and LH in these rats (see below for methods
of measurements). After confirming that the circulating E2 and P4 had reached
their baseline, the ovx rats were divided into three cohorts (7 groups in the first
cohort, 3 groups in the second cohort and 4 groups in the third cohort) comprising
a total of 14 groups (n = 10/group) where the animals were randomly assigned
within each cohort. Animals typically were allowed to reach stable baseline plasma
levels of E2, P4, at 4–6 weeks post ovariectomy, and treatment was begun thereafter.
The number of animals was derived from a Power calculation based on our pre-
liminary data for differences in means, standard deviations, and assuming power =
0.8 and alpha = 0.05.
Following analysis of the plasma levels of E2, P4, FSH, and LH, we selected five
different pHRT treatments in an effort to mimic or exceed the plasma levels
achieved with the bioengineered ovarian cell constructs and to simulate the
temporal plasma levels that might be obtained in pHRT delivery. These five pHRT
groups were: (1) progesterone only (2 mg/kg), (2) low dose of estradiol only (10 µg/
kg), (3) high dose of estradiol only (50 µg/kg), (4) low dose of estradiol +
progesterone (10 µg/kg and 2 mg/kg, respectively), and (5) high dose of estradiol +
progesterone (50 µg/kg and 2 mg/kg respectively). The sixth and seventh groups in
the first cohort were the sham-operated (ovary-intact) and ovx (with placebo
pellets not containing hormones) controls, both of which acted as internal controls
for comparison to the second cohort (below). For pHRT the given estrogen and/or
progesterone doses were delivered by pellets (Innovative Research of America,
Sarasota, FL) implanted subcutaneously as described by others previously17, 20, 63–
66. The pellets were for 90-day release to match the time scale of the measurements
taken for the cHRT constructs and contained 17β-estradiol, progesterone, or
nothing (placebo control).
In the second cohort, one group of ovx rats had constructs implanted in their
omentum as a pouch. A second group of ovx rats received blank microcapsules
without any cells (untreated ovx group), and the third group was sham-operated
(ovary-intact). In the third cohort, two groups of ovx rats were implanted in their
omentum pouches with either Ca++-cross-linked or Sr++-cross-linked cHRT
constructs. A third group of ovx rats that received blank microcapsules without any
cells (untreated ovx group) and the fourth group consisting of sham-operated,
ovary-intact rats served as controls for the third cohort. The construct transplant
recipient groups were implanted with tissue-constructs containing ~ 5 × 106 cells of
each type in the omentum pouch. We estimate that there are ~ 2500 of each cell
type (granulosa and theca) for a total of 5000 cells in each construct. We implanted
approximately 1000 constructs per animal for a total of 5 × 106 cells. The number
of cells per construct is much lower than in an individual follicle (~ 200,000
granulosa cells)67, but the total number of implanted cells is similar to the number
of cells in each ovary of the rat (4.7 × 106 of each cell type)68. The body weights of
the rats were measured during weekly blood sample collections (between 8 and 11
am to measure plasma levels of hormones (E2, P4, testosterone, FSH, LH and
inhibin) for 90 days.
Measurement of plasma 17β-estradiol progesterone testosterone FSH LH and
inhibin. To evaluate the endocrine functions of implanted tissue-constructs in the
ovariectomized rats, the levels of E2, P4, FSH and LH were measured in the plasma
samples obtained from all fifteen experimental groups of rats. Levels of testosterone
and inhibin were measured only in the plasma samples obtained from the cohort 2
rats. The levels of sex steroid hormones in the plasma samples were measured using
ELISA kits following the manufacturers’ instructions. The E2 was measured by
competitive ELISA kits purchased from Enzo Life Sciences (Plymouth Meeting, PA;
ADI-901-174) and is reported to have 17.8% cross reactivity with estrone (E1),
0.9% cross reactivity with estriol (E3), and less than 0.5% cross reactivity with other
steroid hormones compared to 100% for E2. The P4 was also measured by com-
petitive ELISA from Enzo Life Sciences (ADI-901-011) and is not reported to have
cross reactivity with other steroid hormones. The testosterone was measured by
competitive ELISA kits purchased from Enzo Life Sciences (Plymouth Meeting, PA;
ADI-901-065) and is reported to have 14.6% cross reactivity with 19-hydro-
xytestosterone, 7.20% cross reactivity with androstendione, 0.72% cross reactivity
with dehydroepiandrosterone, 0.40% cross reactivity with E2 and less than 0.001%
cross reactivity with other steroid hormones compared to 100% for testosterone.
FSH (R6403) and LH (R6316) were measured by sandwich ELISA kits from TSZ
ELISA (Framingham, MA) and have no reported cross-reactivities. Inhibin was
measured by competitive ELISA kits purchased from BlueGene Biotech (Shanghai,
China) and has no reported cross-reactivity.
Measurement of plasma osteocalcin and c-telopeptide of collagen. To assess
the restoration of balance in bone metabolism after cell-based HRT (cohort 2), the
levels of bone turnover markers, osteocalcin (OCN) (bone formation marker) and
c-telopeptide of collagen (CTx) (bone resorption marker), were measured in the
plasma samples from all experimental groups of rats in the second cohort (cHRT).
Both OCN and CTx in the plasma samples were measured using competitive
immunoassay kits purchased from MyBioSource, Inc. (San Diego, California, USA)
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Integrity of the constructs in the explants of omentum pouches. 90 days post-
transplantation, the omentum pouches were resected out. After a gross examina-
tion for any fibrotic tissue around the omentum pouch, the cHRT constructs were
retrieved from the omentum pouch and the constructs were imaged under phase-
contrast microscope. A part of the omentum pouch was used to assess the viability
of the encapsulated cells as described below for “Live/dead analysis of cells”.
Another part of the omentum pouches was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed
after 24 h, processed and embedded in paraffin blocks. The blocks were sectioned at
5 µm thickness by using a Leica RM 2265 and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
The cross sections of omentum pouches were assessed for the integrity of the
constructs and fibrotic capsules around the constructs at 100 x magnifications.
Live/dead analysis of cells in the constructs after 90 days in vivo. The viability
of the encapsulated cells in the cHRT constructs was assessed using a live/dead
assay15. Briefly, the constructs retrieved form the omentum pouches were trans-
ferred to a 24-well plate and incubated with 25 µM CFDA SE (carboxyfluorescein
diacetate, succinimidyl ester) (Life Technologies/Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) in
serum-free medium for 15 min at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in
humidified air. Then the CFDA SE containing medium was replaced with medium
containing 10% FBS and incubated again under the same conditions for another 30
min. The serum-containing medium was then replaced with 50 µg/ml of propidium
iodide (PI) (Life Technologies/Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and incubated at
room temperature for 2 min and the microcapsules were washed to remove excess
PI. The microcapsules were then observed under inverted fluorescence microscope
and imaged. The number of live and dead cells was determined qualitatively from
the composite image acquired using Image-Pro plus software (version 6.3.1.542).
Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry and micro-computed-tomography scans.
Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) measurement was performed by using a
Hologic QDR-4500 Elite Fan Beam X-ray densitometer (Hologic Inc., Waltham,
MA, USA). Fat distribution and whole body bone mineral density (BMD) in vivo
were measured in anesthetized rats using a small animal software (version 13.3:3)
according to methods described by Rosen et al.69. Femur bones were collected and
their qualities were analyzed at Biomedical Research Imaging Center (University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) by using cone-beam X-ray micro-computed-
tomography (µCT) (Scanco Medical AG, Bruttisellen, Switzerland). The bones
were immersed in saline solution (0.9% NaCl) and the distal region of the bone
was scanned at a slice thickness of 18 µm. Three-dimensional images were
reconstructed using the SCANCO-40 software and the following parameters were
analyzed: BMD, fractional trabecular bone volume (BV/TV [%]), trabecular
thickness (Tb.Th [μm]), Trabecular number (Tb.N [1/mm]), trabecular separation
(Tb.Sp [μm]).

 Uterine weight and histology. Uterine tissue was explanted from each rat at the
end of the study, imaged at the gross level, weighed and fixed in 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde. After 24 h the tissues were washed, processed and embedded in
paraffin blocks. The blocks were sectioned at 5 µm thickness by using a Leica RM
2265 and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The longitudinal sections of uteri
were assessed for the thickness of (a) perimetrium [Pe]; (b) myometrium [My] and;
(c) endometrium [En] at 100 x magnifications.
Statistical analysis. The investigator conducting measurements used for statistical
analysis was blinded to the experimental groups for each study. Results are pre-
sented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) unless stated otherwise.
Comparisons between different groups were performed by using one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student–Newman–Keuls post hoc analysis.
Differences were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05. Statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 10.0.1). Satisfaction of
model assumptions and best estimate of error was determined in SPSS software.
