Some birds achieve primate-like levels of cognition, even though
their brains tend to be much smaller in absolute size. This poses a
fundamental problem in comparative and computational neuro-
science, because small brains are expected to have a lower
information-processing capacity. Using the isotropic fractionator
to determine numbers of neurons in specific brain regions, here
we show that the brains of parrots and songbirds contain on
average twice as many neurons as primate brains of the same
mass, indicating that avian brains have higher neuron packing
densities than mammalian brains. Additionally, corvids and parrots
have much higher proportions of brain neurons located in the
pallial telencephalon compared with primates or other mammals
and birds. Thus, large-brained parrots and corvids have forebrain
neuron counts equal to or greater than primates with much larger
brains. We suggest that the large numbers of neurons concen-
trated in high densities in the telencephalon substantially contrib-
ute to the neural basis of avian intelligence.

any birds have cognitive abilities that match or surpass
those of mammals (1). Corvids and parrots appear to be
cognitively superior to other birds, rivalling great apes in many
psychological domains (1–3). They manufacture and use tools (4,
5), solve problems insightfully (6), make inferences about causal
mechanisms (7), recognize themselves in a mirror (8), plan for
future needs (9), and use their own experience to anticipate future
behavior of conspecifics (10) or even humans (11), to mention just
a few striking abilities. In addition, parrots and songbirds (in-
cluding corvids) share with humans and a few other animal
groups a rare capacity for vocal learning (12), and parrots can
learn words and use them to communicate with humans (13).
Superficially, the architecture of the avian brain appears very
different from that of mammals, but recent work demonstrates
that, despite a lack of layered neocortex, large areas of the avian
forebrain are homologous to mammalian cortex (14–16), con-
form to the same organizational principles (15, 17, 18), and play
similar roles in higher cognitive functions (14, 19), including
executive control (20, 21). However, bird brains are small and
the computational mechanisms enabling corvids and parrots to
achieve ape-like intelligence with much smaller brains remain
unclear. The notion that higher encephalization (relative brain
size deviation from brain–body allometry) endows species with
improved cognitive abilities has recently been challenged by data
suggesting that intelligence instead depends on the absolute
number of cerebral neurons and their connections (22–25). This
is in line with recent findings that absolute rather than relative
brain size is the best predictor of cognitive capacity (26–28).
However, although corvids and parrots feature encephalization
comparable to that of monkeys and apes, their absolute brain
size remains small (29, 30). The largest average brain size in
corvids and parrots does not exceed 15.4 g found in the common
raven (29) and 24.7 g found in the hyacinth macaw (30), re-
spectively. Do corvids and parrots provide a strong case for re-
viving encephalization as a valid measure of brain functional
capacity? Not necessarily: it has recently been discovered that
the relationship between brain mass and number of brain neu-
rons differs starkly between mammalian clades (31). Avian
brains seem to consist of small, tightly packed neurons, and it is
thus possible that they can accommodate numbers of neurons
that are comparable to those found in the much larger primate
brains. However, to date, no quantitative data have been avail-
able to test this hypothesis.
Here, we analyze how numbers of neurons compare across
birds and mammals (32–39) of equivalent brain mass, and de-
termine the cellular scaling rules for brains of songbirds and
parrots. Using the isotropic fractionator (40), we estimated the
total numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells in the cerebral
hemispheres, cerebellum, diencephalon, tectum, and brainstem
in a sample of 11 parrot species, 13 vocal learning songbird species
(including 6 corvids), and 4 additional model species representing
other avian clades (Figs. S1 and S2). Because most of the cited
mammalian studies analyzed cellular composition of only three
brain subdivisions, namely the pallium (referred to as the cerebral
cortex in those papers), the cerebellum, and rest of brain, we
divided the avian brain identically to ensure an accurate com-
parison of neuronal numbers, densities, and relative distribution
of neurons in birds and mammals. Specifically, the avian pallium
(comprising the hyperpallium, mesopallium, nidopallium, arcopallium,
and hippocampus) was compared with its homolog—the mam-
malian pallium (comprising the neocortex, hippocampus, olfac-
tory cortices such as piriform and entorhinal cortex, and pallial
Significance
Birds are remarkably intelligent, although their brains are
small. Corvids and some parrots are capable of cognitive feats
comparable to those of great apes. How do birds achieve im-
pressive cognitive prowess with walnut-sized brains? We in-
vestigated the cellular composition of the brains of 28 avian
species, uncovering a straightforward solution to the puzzle:
brains of songbirds and parrots contain very large numbers of
neurons, at neuronal densities considerably exceeding those
found in mammals. Because these “extra” neurons are pre-
dominantly located in the forebrain, large parrots and corvids
have the same or greater forebrain neuron counts as monkeys
with much larger brains. Avian brains thus have the potential
to provide much higher “cognitive power” per unit mass than
do mammalian brains.

 amygdala) (14–16, 41). The avian subpallium (formed by the
striatum, pallidum, and septum), diencephalon, tectum, and brain-
stem were pooled and compared with the same regions of
mammalian brains that are referred to as “the rest of brain.” The
cerebellum is directly compared between the two clades. The
results of our study reveal that avian brains contain many more
pallial neurons than equivalently sized mammalian brains.
Results
Total Numbers of Neurons. We found that the bird brains have
more neurons than mammalian brains and even primate brains
of similar mass (Fig. 1 A and B), and have very high neuronal
densities (Fig. 2 B and C). Among the songbirds studied, weighing
between 4.5 and 1,070 g, brain mass ranges from 0.36 to 14.13 g,
and total numbers of neurons in the brain from 136 million to 2.17
billion (Fig. S3 and Table S1; for complete data see Datasets S1
and S2). In the parrots studied, body mass ranges between 23 and
1,008 g, brain mass from 1.15 to 20.73 g, and numbers of brain
neurons from 227 million to 3.14 billion. Interestingly, the re-
lationship between brain mass and the number of brain neurons
can be described by similar power functions in these two bird

Cellular scaling rules for brains of songbirds and parrots compared with
those for mammals. (A) Avian and mammalian brains depicted at the same scale.
Numbers under each brain represent brain mass (in grams) and total number of
brain neurons (in millions). Notice that brains of songbirds (goldcrest, starling, and
rook) and parrots (cockatoo) contain more than twice as many neurons as rodent
(mouse and rat) and primate (marmoset and galago) brains of similar size. (Scale
bar: 10 mm.) (B) Brain mass plotted as a function of total number of neurons. Note
that allometric lines for songbirds (green line) and parrots (red line) do not differ
from each other, but they do differ from allometric lines for mammals (for sta-
tistics, see SI Results). (C) Brain mass plotted as a function of total number of
nonneuronal cells. (D) Brain mass plotted as a function of body mass. (E) Total
number of brain neurons plotted as a function of body mass. Allometric lines for
the taxa examined are significantly different (for statistics, see SI Results). Each
point represents the average values for one species. Data points representing
noncorvid songbirds are light green, and data points representing corvid songbirds
are dark green. The fitted lines represent reduced major axis (RMA) regressions
and are shown only for correlations that are significant [coefficient of determi-
nation (r2) ranges between 0.831 and 0.997; P ≤ 0.021 in all cases]. Because non-

 groups (Table S2). Thus, songbirds and parrots with similar brain
masses also have similar total numbers of brain neurons, as shown
in Fig. 1B. Because the scaling exponents are significantly higher
than 1.0 in both groups, any gain in number of brain neurons is
accompanied by an even more pronounced gain of mass: a 10-
fold increase in the number of neurons results in a 16.9- and
14.0-fold larger brain in songbirds and parrots, respectively. With
their higher neuronal densities (Fig. 3 A–C), songbird and parrot
brains accommodate about twice as many neurons as primate
brains of the same mass and two to four times more neurons than
rodent brains of equivalent mass (Fig. 1B). Songbirds and parrots
also show a large brain mass for their body mass compared with
nonprimate mammals (Fig. S4 A and B). Consequently, they
have many more neurons than a nonprimate mammal of the
same body size (Fig. 1E). For instance, the goldcrest’s body mass
is ∼9-fold smaller than the mouse, but its brain has ∼2.3-fold
more neurons. Large corvids and parrots possess the largest
avian brains, harboring the highest absolute numbers of neurons
(Fig. 1 D and E and Fig. S4C). Their total numbers of neurons
are comparable to those of small monkeys or much larger un-
gulates (Fig. S5).
Relative Distribution of Mass and Neurons. The bird/mammal com-
parison becomes even more striking when the relative distribu-
tion of neurons among the major brain components is taken into
consideration. In the birds examined, the telencephalon mass
fraction increases with brain size at the expense of all other brain
components, ranging from 63% to 80% in songbirds, and from
71% to 85% in parrots (Fig. 4 A and B and Table S3); the rel-
ative proportion of the telencephalon resembles that reported
for primates (42) (primates, 74 ± 5%; songbirds, 72 ± 6%; parrots,
78 ± 5%). The cerebellar mass fraction decreases from 11% to
8% in songbirds, and from 11% to 6% in parrots. Besides this,
telencephalon mass scales approximately isometrically with the
number of neurons, whereas all other brain components hyper-
scale in mass as they gain neurons (Table S2), because neuronal
densities decrease and average neuronal sizes increase signifi-
cantly as brains get larger within all brain parts but the telen-
cephalon (Fig. 2 B and C). Thus, in contrast to mammals, larger
brains of songbirds and parrots contain increasing proportions of
neurons in the telencephalon, and correspondingly decreasing
proportions of brain neurons in the cerebellum and other brain
regions (Fig. 4 C and D). Neuronal densities in the avian pallium
exceed those observed in the primate pallium by a factor of 3–4
(Fig. 3A). Hence, the telencephalon houses 38–62% of all brain
neurons in songbirds and 53–78% in parrots (Fig. 4C); the pallium
houses 33–55% in songbirds and 46–61% in parrots (Fig. 3D and
Table S4). This markedly contrasts with the situation found in
mammals, in which the pallium accounts for most of total brain
volume, but the cerebellum houses a large majority of brain neu-
rons (32–39) (Fig. 3 D–F). Notably, the human pallium contains a
mere 19% of brain neurons but represents 82% of brain mass (38).
Thus, when avian and mammalian brains of equivalent size are
compared, avian pallial neurons greatly outnumber those observed
in the mammalian pallium (Fig. 3G and Fig. S5). For instance, the
goldcrest has ∼64 million pallial neurons, almost five times more
than the mouse pallium. The raven or the kea have ∼1.2 billion
pallial neurons, more than in the pallium of a capuchin monkey,
and the blue-and-yellow macaw has ∼1.9 billion pallial neurons,
more than in the pallium of a rhesus monkey.
Subpallium. Although once believed to constitute almost the
entire avian telencephalon (14), the subpallium (basal ganglia
homolog) accounts only for 10–22% of total telencephalon
volume in songbirds and for 15–18% in parrots, and houses
only 9–16% of telencephalic neurons in songbirds and 14–24%
in parrots (Tables S3 and S4). In songbirds, both the relative
mass of the subpallium and the fraction of telencephalic

 neurons contained within it decrease with increasing telenceph-
alon size (Fig. 5 B and C). In parrots, in contrast, the relative
mass remains constant and neuronal fraction increases with
telencephalon size. Therefore, large-brained parrots have a
relatively larger subpallium within the telencephalon that ac-
commodates relatively more telencephalic neurons than that
of large-brained songbirds (Fig. 5 B–D), implying that parrots
have evolved a specific, previously unrecognized cerebrotype (43)
distinguished by a higher number of neurons allocated to the
subpallium. Because subpallial structures play an important role
in sensory and motor learning and execution of motor behavior
(15, 44), we suggest that the relatively enlarged subpallium in
large parrots is likely associated with their greater learning skills,
including vocal learning, and enhanced foot and beak dexterity
(5, 6, 13, 45).
Nonneuronal Scaling Rules. Although neuronal scaling rules for avian
brains differ from those for mammalian brains (Fig. 1B), non-
neuronal scaling rules are shared between the two vertebrate classes
(Fig. 1C and Table S2). In line with data from all mammals analyzed
so far (32–39), the densities of nonneuronal (glial and endothelial)
cells remain similar across bird species in all brain structures, except
for the telencephalon, where nonneuronal cell density appears to be
distinctively lower (Fig. 2 D and E). The latter may be a specific
avian feature, as it has not been observed in mammals (31).
Glia/Neuron Ratio. Neurons outnumber nonneuronal cells in both
bird groups examined (Fig. S6A and Table S5). The proportion of
nonneuronal cells in the brain ranges between 21% and 37% in
songbirds and from 31% to 41% in parrots. Hence, the maximal
glia/neuron ratio (if all nonneuronal cells were glial cells) for the
whole brain ranges from 0.27 to 0.59 in songbirds and from 0.44 to
0.69 in parrots. Like in mammals (32–39, 46), the proportion of
nonneuronal cells is very small in the cerebellum, varying between
12% and 19% in songbirds and between 14% and 19% in parrots,
but, in contrast to mammals, nonneuronal cells also constitute a
minor cellular fraction in the telencephalon, representing 21–40%
of cells in songbirds and 31–43% of cells in parrots (Fig. S6B).
Nonneuronal cells predominate in the remaining brain regions
analyzed, representing in songbirds and parrots, respectively, 60–
90% and 79–94% of all cells in the diencephalon, 28–70% and
52–71% of all cells in the tectum, and 76–95% and 85–95% of all
cells in the brainstem (Fig. S6B). The fact that neurons constitute
an extremely small cellular fraction in the diencephalon of many
avian species is an unexpected finding. Given that nonneuronal
cell densities are similar to those found in most other brain di-
visions investigated (Fig. 2 D and E), this is unlikely to be due to
a technical error. The numeric preponderance of neurons over
nonneuronal cells in the bird brain as a whole is therefore due to
the disproportionately large numbers of neurons in the telenceph-
alon and cerebellum.
Corvid Brain as a Scaled-Up Songbird Brain. When considering the
numbers of neurons and nonneuronal cells and their allocations
to the major brain divisions, the same scaling rules apply to the
brains of corvids and noncorvid songbirds (Figs. 1–5 and Table
S2). Thus, it is not cellular composition but encephalization that
sets corvids apart from other songbirds. Technically, residual
brain mass calculated from regressions for all songbirds is sig-
nificantly larger in corvids than in noncorvid songbirds [species
examined in this study: t(2,11) = 2.542, P = 0.03, Fig. 1D; species
collated from literature: t(2,848) = 7.55, P < 10−6, Fig. S4C].
Because corvid brains tend to be larger than brains of noncorvid
songbirds for any given body size (Fig. 1D and Fig. S4C), corvids
have larger total numbers of neurons than noncorvid songbirds of
the same body size (Fig. 1E). We suggest that corvid brains are
scaled-up songbird brains, just as humans brains are to brains of
nonhuman primates (38, 47), and that large absolute numbers of
neurons endow corvids with superior cognitive abilities.
Comparison with Other Birds. The similarity of neuronal scaling
rules between songbirds and parrots is not too surprising, con-
sidering their close phylogenetic relationship (48–51). The ex-
amination of outgroup taxa, however, suggests that, as in mammals
(31), different neuronal scaling rules apply to various bird lineages.
The closest relative to songbirds and parrots of the species sam-
pled, the barn owl (Fig. S1) (48–51) resembles songbirds and
parrots in terms of encephalization (Fig. 1D), relative telencephalon
size (Fig. 4A), and neuronal densities in the telencephalon and di-
encephalon (Fig. 2C), but has a proportionally smaller subpallium
(Fig. 5B) and lower neuronal densities in the tectum and cerebel-
lum (Fig. 2C). The emu, the red junglefowl, and the pigeon, all
species representing more basal bird lineages (Fig. S1), share
lower degree of encephalization (Fig. 1D), a proportionally smaller
telencephalon (Fig. 4A), small telencephalic and dominant cer-
ebellar neuronal fractions (Fig. 4C), generally lower neuronal
densities (Fig. 2C), and larger glia/neuron ratios (Fig. S6).

 Therefore, their brains harbor much smaller absolute numbers of
neurons than brains of equivalently sized songbirds or parrots.
For instance, although a red junglefowl is ∼50-fold heavier than
a great tit, both birds have approximately the same number of
brain neurons (Fig. 1E and Fig. S3). Remarkably, even in these
basal birds, neuronal densities in the pallium are still comparable
to those observed in the primate cortex (Fig. 3A). Thus, high
neuronal density in the telencephalon appears characteristic of
all birds. This means that neuronal densities in the primate
pallium are matched by those of chicken and emu, but surpassed
by those of songbirds and parrots.
Discussion
Assuming that brains of parrots and songbirds have diverged
from the presumptive ancestral avian pattern found in all rep-
resentatives of basal bird lineages examined and characterized by
a mammal-like numerical preponderance of cerebellar neurons,
we suggest that birds generally have higher neuronal densities
than mammals, and further that parrots and songbirds have ac-
quired an expanded telencephalon with increased neuronal den-
sities. Two proximate, synergistic mechanisms likely contributed to
this evolutionary process. First, just like the expansion of neocortex
in primates (52), the expansion of the telencephalon in parrots and
songbirds is associated with delayed and protracted neurogenesis,
an expanded subventricular zone, and delayed neuronal matura-
tion (53–55). It has been suggested that extensive posthatching
neurogenesis and brain maturation promote learning from con-
specifics and may have facilitated the emergence of specialized
circuits that mediate vocal learning and possibly also other flexible
and innovative behaviors (56). Second, analyses of brain gene ex-
pression profiles strongly suggest that songbirds and parrots in-
dependently evolved vocal learning pathways by duplication of
preexisting, surrounding motor circuits (57, 58). Intriguingly, par-
rot pallial song nuclei underwent a further duplication event to
evolve a unique additional circuit, the so-called shell song system,
which seems to be particularly well developed in large-brained
parrots (45). What ultimate mechanisms drive the evolution of
the enlarged, neuron-rich telencephalon, which sets parrots and
songbirds apart from the more basal birds we examined, remains
poorly understood. We suggest that this expansion has been due
to simultaneous selective pressures on cognitive enhancement
and an evolutionary constraint on brain size, which may stem
from the constraints on body size imposed by active flight.
Altriciality and the extended parental care that has developed in
avian ancestors simultaneously relaxed constraints on the dura-
tion of ontogenesis, a precondition for telencephalic expansion
by the mechanisms described above (56). Moreover, a short neck
relative to many other bird lineages may have reduced biophys-
ical constraints on head size (cf. ref. 59).
Our finding of greater than primate-like numbers of neurons
in the pallium of parrots and songbirds suggests that the large
absolute numbers of telencephalic neurons in these two clades
provide a means of increasing computational capacity, support-
ing their advanced behavioral and cognitive complexity, despite
their physically smaller brains. Moreover, a short interneuronal
distance, the corollary of the extremely high packing densities of
their telencephalic neurons, likely results in a high speed of in-
formation processing, which may further enhance cognitive
abilities of these birds. Thus, the nuclear architecture of the
avian brain appears to exhibit more efficient packing of neurons
and their interconnections than the layered architecture of the
mammalian neocortex.
Further comparative studies on additional species are required
to determine whether the high neuronal densities and preferential
allocation of neurons to the telencephalon represent unique fea-
tures of songbirds, parrots, and perhaps some other clades like
owls, or have evolved multiple times independently in large-brained
birds. More detailed quantitative studies should assess the distri-
bution of neurons among various telencephalic regions involved in
specific circuits subserving specific functions. The results, combined
with behavioral studies, will enable us to determine the causal re-
lationships between neuronal numbers and densities and percep-
tual, cognitive, and executive/motor abilities, and greatly advance
our understanding of potential mechanisms linking neuronal den-
sity with information-processing capacity.
Methods
Experimental procedures were all approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at Charles University in Prague. Altogether, 73 birds belonging
to 28 species were used in this study (Table S1). Animals were killed by an
overdose of halothane and perfused with 4% (wt/wt) paraformaldehyde. Brains
were removed, postfixed for an additional 7–21 d, and dissected into the ce-
rebral hemispheres, cerebellum, diencephalon, tectum, and brainstem. In one
individual per species, one hemisphere was dissected into the pallium and the
subpallium. In these brain components, the total numbers of cells, neurons, and
nonneuronal cells were estimated following the procedure of isotropic frac-
tionation described earlier (40). The reduced major axis regressions to power
functions were calculated to describe how structure mass, numbers of cells, and
densities are interrelated across species. Analysis of covariance was used to
compare scaling among groups (taxonomic orders or brain regions). To
compare relative brain size between corvid and noncorvid songbirds, we
computed t test on the residuals of a log–log regression of brain mass
against body mass (residual brain mass, hereafter). For the comparison with
cellular scaling rules reported previously for mammals, the reduced major
axis regressions were calculated from quantitative data published for primates
(33, 37, 38), rodents excluding the naked mole-rat (32, 39), and artiodactyls
(36). In addition, the published quantitative data for Eulipothyphla (34)
and Afrotheria (35) were used for comparison in Fig. S5. Further details are
provided in Supporting Information.
