End-stage lung disease is the third leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 400,000 deaths per year in
the United States alone. To reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with lung disease, new therapeutic
strategies aimed at promoting lung repair and increasing the number of donor lungs available for transplan-
tation are being explored. Because of the extreme complexity of this organ, previous attempts at
bioengineering functional lungs from fully decellularized or synthetic scaffolds lacking functional vasculature
have been largely unsuccessful. An intact vascular network is critical not only for maintaining the blood-gas
barrier and allowing for proper graft function but also for supporting the regenerative cells. We therefore de-
veloped an airway-specific approach to removing the pulmonary epithelium, while maintaining the viability and
function of the vascular endothelium, using a rat model. The resulting vascularized lung grafts supported the
attachment and growth of human adult pulmonary cells and stem cell–derived lung-specified epithelial cells.
We propose that de-epithelialization of the lung with preservation of intact vasculature could facilitate cell ther-
apy of pulmonary epithelium and enable bioengineering of functional lungs for transplantation.
INTRODUCTION
Lung injury, whether acute or chronic, can lead to end-stage lung
disease, a condition that affects millions of patients in the United States
and accounts for approximately 400,000 deaths per year (1). Lung
transplantation—the only definitive treatment for patients with end-
stage lung disease—remains limited by a severe shortage of donor
organs such that only 20% of patients waiting for a donor lung undergo
transplantation (2). Strategies aimed at increasing the number of trans-
plantable lungs would have an immediate and profound impact. In
addition, early intervention with gene or cell therapy may offer even
greater benefits by promoting lung repair and regeneration, thus
slowing the progression of disease and ultimately avoiding the need
for transplantation (3, 4).
Gas exchange, the major function of the lung, requires close inter-
action between functional epithelium, intact alveolar-capillary mem-
brane, and viable endothelium. Lung epithelium is highly susceptible
to pathological insults and is specifically implicated in a number of con-
genital and acquired diseases. After injury, lung epithelium may either
activate physiologic repair mechanisms or undergo aberrant remodel-
ing. When repair mechanisms fail, epithelial-vascular-mesenchymal
interplay canleadto dysfunctionalwound healing dominatedby fibrosis
(3). The period following injury that determines the fate of lung epithe-
lium may serve as an optimal window of time for therapeutic interven-
tion to either promote healthy physiologic repair or allow for cell
replacement. Tissue engineering strategies are currently under develop-
mentto regenerateorreplaceinjuredlungs(5–8).Because of theextreme
complexity of the lung, with its hierarchical three-dimensional
architecture, diverse cellular composition, highly specialized extra-
cellular matrix (ECM), and region-specific structure and function
(4, 9, 10), bioengineering a functional lung is still an elusive goal
(11, 12). The lungs bioengineered by full decellularization and recellu-
larization have shown a limited and temporary function, largely due to
blood clotting and pulmonary edema, which have led to lung failure
within a few hours following transplantation. To date, whole-organ
engineering methods using lung grafts with denuded vascular networks
have failed to produce functional grafts.
Given the essential need for intact and functional pulmonary vascu-
lature (13), we developed an airway-specific approach to removing the
pulmonary epithelium while preserving the lung vasculature, ECM,
and other supporting cell types (for example, fibroblasts, myocytes,
chondrocytes, and pericytes). We demonstrated the outcomes of our
method by using a rodent lung model. Following lung cannulation,
lungs were ventilated and perfused on an ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP)
circuit (Fig. 1A). A mild detergent solution was delivered intratracheally
to an isolated single lung (Fig. 1B) to remove epithelial cells and obtain a
functional vascularized lung scaffold (Fig. 1, C and D). We investigated
the utility of this model in (i) removing pulmonary epithelial cells, (ii)
maintaining and preserving pulmonary vascular integrity and function,
and (iii) creating a vascularized lung scaffold supporting the delivery
and engraftment of human airway epithelium and stem cell-derived
lung-specified epithelial cells.

Lung de-epithelialization
Rat lung epithelium was removed by infusing a detergent solution only

 animal was placed on an EVLP circuit (fig. S1B) and primed with
venous blood. Ventilation on 21% oxygen resulted in normal gas ex-
change (DpO2 = 121 ± 10 mmHg and DpCO2 = −184 ± 6 mmHg),
normal pH (pre-EVLP, 6.74 ± 0.3; EVLP, 7.4 ± 0.4), and a change to
normal blood color (fig. S1C). The airway in one lung was isolated by
cannulation of the main bronchus and ventilated to serve as control,
whereas the other lung was subjected to de-epithelialization (Fig. 1B).
Single lung ventilation maintained physiologic pH, pO2, and pCO2 (fig.
S1C). Stable EVLP was achieved using a physiologic vascular perfus-
ate composed of electrolytes, an energy substrate, and an oncotic reg-
ulator (Fig. 1E) that supported the lung during de-epithelialization
(fig. S1D).
On the basis of previous studies in our laboratory (14), a 3-[(3-
cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPS)
detergent–based solution was used for airway de-epithelialization. Con-
centrations of CHAPS and sodium chloride were optimized to enable
efficient removal of the pulmonary epithelium while minimizing effects
on the pulmonary interstitium and vasculature (Fig. 1E and fig. S2, A
and C). To enhance distribution of the solution throughout the airway
and to improve epithelial cell removal by physical agitation, we venti-
lated lungs at low tidal volumes (TV) [0.03 ml/100 g; normal value,
0.3 ml/100 g body weight (15)] and a high frequency [150 to 180 breaths
per minute (bpm)], mimicking the high-frequency oscillatory ventilation
(HFOV) used clinically in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
patients (movies S1 and S2).
Microscopic and Western blot analyses confirmed the removal of
pulmonary epithelium (Fig. 2). In the conductive zone of the lung,
histologic analysis indicated the removal of pseudostratified epithelium
from the airway (Fig. 2, A to D). Immunostaining revealed the pres-
ervation of blood vessels retaining the endothelial cell marker Von
Willebrand factor (vWF) and the interstitial fibroblast marker vimentin
(fig. S3, A to D), adjacent to large airways stripped of the epithelial cell
marker epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) (Fig. 2, E and F).
Similarly, in the respiratory zone, lung epithelium was removed from
the bronchioles and alveoli (Fig. 2, G and H), with the preservation of
small blood vessels retaining vWF and a significant reduction in the
epithelial cell marker EpCAM (fig. S3, E and F), the alveolar type I cell
marker aquaporin 5 (Aq5) (Fig. 2, I and J), and the type II cell marker

(EpCAM) and endothelial (CD31) cell markers in de-epithelialized lungs

(70%) of epithelial cells (Fig. 2, M and N, and fig. S3I). Furthermore,
de-epithelialized lungs showed significant reductions in lung epithe-
lial cell–specific markers, including Aq5 (bronchial epithelial and alve-
olar type I cell marker), SPC (alveolar type II cell marker), acetylated
tubulin (ciliated cell marker) (16, 17), and CC-10 (club cell marker)
(fig. S3, G and H). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of de-
epithelialized lungs showed denuded basement membrane due to the
loss of alveolar epithelium and retention of both the alveolar-capillary
basement membrane and microvascular endothelial cells in pulmonary
capillaries (Fig. 2, O and P, and fig. S3, J to M).
Preservation of lung structure and ECM
Immunostaining, scanning electron microscopy, and quantitative
analyses suggested that the de-epithelialized lung retains a native-like
structure and ECM (Fig. 3). Distributions of ECM components retained
in the de-epithelialized lung were similar to those in the native lung (Fig.
3A and fig. S4A), as well as the vessel structure (Fig. 3, B to E), histo-
morphology of airway submucosa and cartilage (Fig. 3, D to G), pres-
ervation of elastic fibers (Fig. 3, H and I), and architecture of the alveoli
(fig. S4A). Further quantification of ECM components demonstrated
no significant differences between native and de-epithelialized lungs
with respect to hydroxyproline (HOP) (P = 0.72) and elastin (P =
0.26), indicating that de-epithelialization does not significantly reduce
the concentrations of critical lung matrix components (Fig. 3J). Sulfated
glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) content was decreased in de-epithelialized
lungs compared to native lungs, although not significantly (P = 0.15).
Quantification of DNA showed a 23.4% decrease in DNA content of
de-epithelialized lungs compared to native lungs (P = 0.04) (Fig. 3J).
In comparison, full decellularization resulted in the removal of >80%
of DNA content compared to native lungs and 60% compared to
de-epithelialized lungs (P < 0.0001, when compared to both native and
de-epithelialized lungs). Scanning electronic microscopy confirmed the
preservation of bronchial, alveolar, and vascular structures (Fig. 3K and

 fig. S4, B to G). Morphometric and stereologic analyses did not show any
significant differences between native and de-epithelialized lungs with
respect to airspace volume fraction (native, 0.76 ± 0.05; de-epithelialized,
0.70 ± 0.08; P = 0.27; values are expressed as means ± SD throughout),
septal volume fraction (native, 0.24 ± 0.05; de-epithelialized, 0.29 ±

7.1 ± 0.5 mm; P = 0.98), and surface density (native, 0.067 ± 0.009;
de-epithelialized, 0.081 ± 0.017; P = 0.15) (Fig. 3L). Because of the loss
of alveolar surfactant and epithelial cells, dynamic lung compliance de-
creased after de-epithelialization (fig. S5, A to C).
Airway structure and smooth muscle function
Bronchial architecture, smooth muscle, and ECM components play
pivotal roles in regulating gas exchange in the respiratory zone of the
lung. Pentachrome staining of large bronchi showed de-epithelialized
airways with histologic appearance otherwise similar to that of native
airways. Collagen abundance in submucosal interstitium and airway
cartilage is shown in yellow, with elastic fibers highlighted in black
(Fig. 4, A and B). Smooth muscle actin (SMA) was observed in native
and de-epithelialized lungs surrounding large airways and arteries
(Fig. 4, C and D). Similarities in underlying airway smooth muscle

 between native and de-epithelialized lungs were observed regardless
of the presence or absence of airway epithelium (Fig. 4, C and D, arrow-
heads). Airway casts imaged by scanning electron microscopy
showed no microscopic differences in airway structure between na-
tive and de-epithelialized lungs. Thin parallel striations visible along
the length of bronchi within airway casts suggested that the natural
wrinkles present in native lung airway lining (which render airways ca-
pable of accommodating increases in airway diameter up to 30% during
inspiration) were also preserved following de-epithelialization (Fig. 4, E
and F). Therefore, although the epithelial cells were effectively removed,
it did not compromise the structure of the basement membrane lining
of airways. Clusters of alveolar sacs were visible in airway casts of both
native and de-epithelialized lungs (Fig. 4, E and F).
To assess the viability of airway smooth muscle cells and their re-
sponsiveness to physiological signals, we subjected de-epithelialized
lungs to methacholine challenge similar to that used diagnostically for
asthmatic patients (18, 19). Following administration of methacholine,
dynamic compliance significantly decreased in both native lungs [from
0.190 ± 0.046 ml/cmH2O to 0.048 ± 0.007 ml/cmH2O (reduction of
74.7 ± 8.7%)] and de-epithelialized lungs [from 0.065 ± 0.036 ml/
cmH2O to 0.031 ± 0.004 ml/cmH2O (reduction of 45.3 ± 19%)]. These
data demonstrated a clear bronchoconstrictive response to stimulation
of muscarinic receptors in smooth muscle cells of the de-epithelialized
lung airway (Fig. 4, G and H, and fig. S5, D to G). Following de-
epithelialization, lungs showed reduced lung compliance before
methacholine challenge (fig. S5, F and G).
Global preservation, viability, and function of
pulmonary vasculature
Integrity of the pulmonary vascular bed and the alveolar-capillary
membrane is critical for lung function (13, 20). Immunostaining of
de-epithelialized lung revealed preservation of markers for endothelial
cells (vWF and CD31), smooth muscle cells (SMA), pericytes (NG2),
tight junctions [zonula occludens–1 (ZO-1)], and gap junctions [con-
nexin 43 (Cx43)] throughout the pulmonary vasculature (Fig. 5A and
fig. S6A). The function of endothelial cells in the de-epithelialized lung
was confirmed by the uptake of acetylated low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) (Fig. 5B and fig. S6, B and C). The fractions of endothelial cells
thatwereapoptoticintheTUNEL(terminaldeoxynucleotidyltransferase–
mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling) assay were com-
parable for the native and de-epithelialized lungs (n = 3, 82 of 521 and
33 of 385, respectively; P = 0.16) (Fig. 5C and fig. S6, D and E).
To assess the viability and function of vascular smooth muscle cells
following de-epithelialization, a vasoconstrictor and a vasodilator were
subsequentlyadministered,whilepressurewasmeasuredinthepulmonary
artery (PA). De-epithelialized lungs demonstrated a marked vaso-
constrictive response to endothelin-1, with an 89% pulmonary arterial
pressure increase from baseline within 10 min. Response to the vaso-
dilator treprostinil reversed most of the effects of endothelin-1 and
demonstrated a notable decrease in arterialpressure after 20 min, result-
inginanarterialpressureof31.9%ofbaseline(Fig.5Dandfig.S6,FandG).
To assess alveolar-capillary barrier function in de-epithelialized
lungs, 500-kDa FITC-dextran was administered via the PA and
collected from the pulmonary veins (PVs) and airways (21). Native
lungs and fully decellularized lungs retained 96 ± 6% and 21 ± 4%, re-
spectively, of the total dextran administered to the vascular compart-
ment. De-epithelialized lungs retained 62 ± 9.5% of the total dextran,
indicating significant preservation of the alveolar-capillary barrier
(Fig. 5E). Histologic assessment documented the differences between
native, de-epithelialized, andfully decellularizedlungs(Fig. 5F). To eval-
uate the integrity of the pulmonary microvasculature, 0.2-mm-diameter
fluorescent microspheres were administered to de-epithelialized lungs
through the PA and were seen in capillaries and larger vessels but not in
either the alveoli or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, indicating
the integrity of the vascular tree (Fig. 5, G to I, and movies S3 and S4).
Recellularization of vascularized lung scaffolds
To assess whether de-epithelialized lungs could serve as a vascularized
lung scaffold supporting therapeutic human cells, we developed a lung
bioreactor system to investigate the engraftment and survival of human
small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) and human-induced pluripotent
stem cell (hiPSC)–derived lung-specified epithelial cells (22, 23) within
de-epithelialized lung scaffolds(Fig. 6A). SAECs were labeled with near-
infrared (NIR) dye before intratracheal delivery to enable real-time
transpleural imaging as a means of visualizing and monitoring cell
distribution immediately after delivery (Fig. 6B). Twenty-four hours
after delivery, carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)–
labeled SAECs were detected throughout the tracheobronchial tree and
in subpleural regions (Fig. 6C). Histological analysis of recellularized
lungs confirmed the preservation of intact blood vessels (Fig. 6, D
andE,fig.S7,AandB)andthepresenceofcellswithsquamousmorphology
attached to the basement membrane reconstituting the alveolar epithelium
(Fig. 6, F and G, and fig. S7, C and D). Vascularized lung grafts were

 effectively repopulated with CFSE-labeled SAECs. A total of 51.98 ±
2.78% epithelial cells in the lung graft were human (n = 3) (Fig. 6, H
to J). Notably, vascularized lung scaffolds recellularized with SAECs
displayed a level of metabolism similar to native lungs (P = 0.87) (Fig.
6K). DNA content of the recellularized lung was similar to that of the
native lung (n = 3; native, 596.18 ± 386.12 ng per tissue biopsy; re-
cellularized, 884.58 ± 596.37 ng per tissue biopsy; P = 0.40, Student’s
t test). Furthermore, 24 hours after recellularization, vascularized lung
scaffolds demonstrated improved compliance (native, 0.066 ± 0.002 ml/
cmH2O; de-epithelialized, 0.017 ± 0.002 ml/cmH2O; recellularized,
0.026 ± 0.0015 ml/cmH2O). Compliance decreased by 74.2 ± 3.9%
following de-epithelialization but increased by 53.4 ± 21% following re-
cellularization by SAECs (Fig. 6L).
Survival and proliferation of delivered CFSE-labeled SAECs were
assessed by immunostaining for Ki67 (proliferation marker) (Fig. 6M
and fig. S7, E and F) and activated caspase-3 (apoptosis marker) (Fig.

of 856 and 31 of 1030 Ki67-positive cells among CFSE-labeled SAECs
and native cells, respectively (n = 3; P < 0.0001, Student’s t test). The
fractions of apoptotic cells in recellularized and intact lungs were com-
parable: 9 of 543 or 5 of 538 caspase-3–positive cells among CFSE-
labeled SAECs, respectively (n = 3; P = 0.41, Student’s t test).

 As a translational alternative to SAECs, vascularized lung scaffolds
were recellularized with mRNA hiPSC–derived lung-specified epithelial
cells fluorescently labeled at days 40 to 45. The cells contained 71.25 ±
3.34% FOXA2+NX2.1+ cells [over 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole–positive
(DAPI+)population]ofwhichapproximatelyhalfexpressedSPB (22, 23).
Twenty-four and forty-eight hours after intratracheal delivery, cells
were uniformly distributed and attached to the alveolar basement
membrane (Fig. 6, O to T). Notably, hiPSC-derived lung-specified
epithelial cells attached to the native lung matrix (Fig. 6, O and P, and
fig. S7, G and H) and expressed apical membrane markers specific to
alveolar type I (HT1-56) (Fig. 6, Q and R) (24, 25) and type II (HT2-280)
cells (Fig. 6, S and T, and fig. S7, I to L) (25–27).
DISCUSSION
End-stage lung disease has a profound impact on the quality and dura-
tion of countless lives and represents a growing burden to health care
systems worldwide (28). Despite meritorious efforts to better under-
stand the pathogenesis of lung disease and identify targets and strategies
to reverse disease trajectory, many patients suffer significant impair-
ment and ultimately require lung transplantation (2). Although in-
creasing the pool of donor lungs by implementing tissue engineering
strategies has tremendous promise, several key obstacles have slowed
the progress and even questioned the validity of this approach. The
absence of functional vascular networks has been a major limitation
in creating functional, nonthrombogenic lung constructs (5, 11, 12).
Given the complexity of the lung, the needs for nutrient and oxygen
delivery require vascular supply (13). Global lung function depends
on the intricate and extensive capillary network, which could not be
recapitulated or preserved using available bioengineering methods.
We demonstrate a transformative approach to obtaining functional
vascularized lung grafts. By intratracheal targeting of the airway, we
removed lung epithelium in a manner that preserves the surrounding
cells, matrix, basement membrane, and vasculature. De-epithelialized
lungs with intact, functional vasculature could serve as physiologic
scaffold by (i) enabling the delivery of nutrients, oxygen, growth factors,
and signaling molecules; (ii) providing key biophysical and mechanical
signals via perfusion (flow and shear) and ventilation (strain); and (iii)
maintaining the ECM (biochemical moieties, adhesion molecules, and
matricryptic peptides) and the interstitial and support cells (fibroblasts,
pericytes, endothelial, mesothelial, and lymphatic cells).
Previously established methods for decellularization of the entire
organ were designed to remove both the epithelium and endothelium
and could only be applied ex vivo (5, 11, 12, 14). This study developed
the first procedure for the removal of epithelium from the lung airway
with the full preservation of vascular epithelium, which could be applied
in vivo to treat diseases of lung epithelium (for example, ARDS and
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). Whole lung scaffolds with an intact
vascular network may also allow for recellularization using patient-
specific cells and bioengineering of chimeric lungs for transplantation
capable of gas exchange. In addition to the clinical potential, lung scaf-
folds lacking an intact epithelial layer but with functional vascular and
interstitial compartments may also serve as a valuable physiological
model for investigating (i) lung development, (ii) the etiology and
pathogenesis of lung diseases involving pulmonary epithelium, (iii)
acute lung injury and repair, and (iv) stem cell therapies.
We demonstrated the removal of airway epithelium by general
histology (Fig. 2, A to D and G and H); immunostaining of EpCAM,
Aq5, and SPC (Fig. 2, E and F and I to L); immunoblotting of EpCAM
and other lung epithelial cell–specific markers (Fig. 2M and fig. S3G);
and a 24% decrease in the DNA content (Fig. 3J). Given the cellular
composition in the parenchyma of rat lung (43% endothelial cells,
32% interstitial cells, and 22% epithelial cells) (29), these results demon-
strated that the treatment effects are well contained to the epitheli-
um. Typically, full organ decellularization results in 75 to 98% DNA
reduction, consistent with the depletion of all cell types (14, 30–32).
Tissue ECM is known to provide the structural and mechanical
support for resident cells, along with biochemical cues: growth factors,
chemokines, and cytokines. The structure, composition, and mechanics
of the ECM play major biological roles, making tissue-specific ECM an
ideal scaffold for cell attachment, differentiation, and functional organiza-
tion (11, 33–37). In this respect, the proposed method results in retention
of the lung architecture and matrix proteins, as evidenced by immuno-
staining (collagen IV, collagen I, elastin, fibronectin, and laminin), quan-
tification of HOP and elastin (Fig. 3, A and J, and fig. S4A), scanning
electronmicroscopy(Fig.3K),andmorphometricandstereologicanalyses
(Fig. 3L). Although not statistically significant, the measured decrease in
sGAG content of de-epithelialized lungs (Fig. 3J) may be due to the loss of
epithelial cell–associated sGAGs rather than matrix-bound sGAGs be-
cause our approach uses CHAPS at pH 8, known to be more protective
of matrix-bound sGAGs compared to treatments with solutions at higher
pH (31). The preserved matrix features in de-epithelialized lungs
support diverse lung functions: elastic recoil during ventilation, cell
adhesion, and barrier function.
The endothelial cells and functional vasculature were preserved in
de-epithelialized lungs, as demonstrated by histology (Fig. 2, A
and B), immunostaining for vWF (Fig. 2, E and F and I and J), and im-
munoblotting for CD31 (Fig. 2, M and N). The alveolar-capillary mem-
brane remained intact, as shown by TEM and immunostaining for
gap (Cx43) and tight (ZO-1) junctions (Figs. 2, O and P, and 5A and
figs. S3, J to M, and S6A). Viability and function of endothelial cells in
the macro- and microvasculature were shown by the capture of acety-
lated LDL (Fig. 5B and fig. S6, B and C). Blood vessels maintained
responsiveness to vasoconstrictors/vasodilators, indicating that de-
epithelialized lung scaffolds are capable of regulating blood flow
(Fig. 5D). Integrity of the pulmonary vascular tree was well preserved,
as demonstrated by the infusion of FITC-dextran (Fig. 5E) and micro-
spheres (Fig. 5, H and I, and movies S3 and S4). The leakage ofdextranin
de-epithelializedlungscaffolds(~30%)washigherthanthatinanintactlung
but much lower than that in a fully decellularized lung. This leakage,
indicative of weakened endothelial tight junctions, may be transient and
recoverable,giventhepresenceofpreservedendothelialcellsandpericytes,
an expectation that will need to be confirmed in long-term studies.
Ultimately, a challenge for using de-epithelialized lung as a scaffold
for lung bioengineering is lung regeneration following infusion of fresh
epithelial cells. Here, de-epithelialized lung scaffolds with preserved
functional vasculature enabled the delivery and topographic
distribution of several types of human cells, including human SAECs
and hiPSC-derived lung-specified epithelial cells (Fig. 6). Cells attached
throughout the distal lung, assuming a flattened morphology that nor-
mally precedes reconstitution of airway epithelium (Fig. 6, F and G).
Fifty-two percent of all epithelial cells in our recellularized and vascu-
larized lung scaffolds were human (Fig. 6, H to J). Following 24 hours of
incubation in a bioreactor, cells were viable (Fig. 6, M and N) and meta-
bolically active (Fig. 6K). Recellularized lungs with SAECs showed high-
er numbers of Ki67-positive cells compared to native lungs. This result
is likely a reflection of the relatively low regeneration rate in native lungs
(4) when compared to a cell line like SAECs.

 Lung compliance showed a trend of improvement (Fig. 6L) that we
attribute to recellularization and reconstitution of the alveolar mem-
brane, rather than surfactant production, because we would not expect
SAECs to produce surfactants over this time course. In previous studies
of full decellularization and recellularization with rat lung fetal or neo-
natal epithelial cells (11, 12), lung constructs showed production of SPC
and SPA only at 4 to 5 days of bioreactor culture. Finally, hiPSC-derived
lung-specified epithelial cells expressed markers specific to alveolar type I
and type II cells (Fig. 6, Q to T), indicating that the vascularized lung
scaffold supported their survival and phenotypic gene expression.
There are several limitations to the present study, which open new
avenues for future research. To preserve the architecture and viability of
the vascular compartment, we carefully titrated our de-epithelialization
solution to only remove, as much as possible, epithelial cells. This ti-
trated balance, which enabled vasculature preservation, also resulted
in the retention of some endogenous epithelial cells. Nevertheless, we
believe that these few remaining cells may also provide important in-
structive cues to cells newly introduced into the airway. Although our
de-epithelialization approach targets airway epithelial removal, we
cannot exclude some detergent leak in the vascular compartment.
Although vascular viability and the attachment of exogenous cells
confirmed a functional scaffold, long-term studies are needed to in-
vestigate the presence of residual detergent after de-epithelialization
and its effects on scaffold functionality and cell viability. Immuno-
logical changes during de-epithelialization and recellularization
were not investigated, given that human cells were studied in nude
rats. It would be of interest to investigate the role of the innate immune
system in chimeric lung constructs and define the host response to de-
epithelialization in situ. In terms of recellularization, our hypothesis
is that human pluripotent stem cell progenitor cells seeded into de-
epithelialized regions of the lung, with the support of functional lung
vasculature, will enable regeneration and remodeling of the donor
lung. This could lead to a gradual increase in the fraction of the re-
cipient’scells andcontribute to global lung functionality. Unless patient-
specific hiPSC cells can be used in the future, immunosuppression
would be necessary during this transient period (extent and duration
remain to be determined). Although this study used healthy lungs,
the method is intended for application to injured lungs. We antici-
pate that diseased epithelium may have enhanced response to de-
epithelialization and that the treatment may thus need to be shortened
to achieve equivalent efficacy. Cell delivery and engraftment potential
were demonstrated over a period of 24 to 48 hours. Vascularized lung
scaffolds demonstrated a high level of recellularization, a parameter
that can be experimentally manipulated by varying the number of
human cells delivered. Additional studies are needed to determine
optimal cell dosage and the degree to which exogenous cells expand
and repopulate the recipient lung. Future studies are needed to eval-
uate the remodeling and function of recellularized lung scaffolds
over prolonged periods and investigate their function in subsequent
transplantation.
Lung decellularization has resulted in substantial advances in lung
bioengineering and the ability to create acellular scaffolds for tissue
engineering applications (11, 12, 21). We believe that our methodology
can address some of the challenges that have slowed the progress in lung
bioengineering by (i) preserving the vascular endothelium throughout
the lung (from large vessels to capillaries) and (ii) targeting the removal
of airway epithelium while maintaining structural and cellular compo-
nents essential for lung repair. Further developments may involve the
therapeutic use of de-epithelialization by targeting specific types
of damaged/defective cells. Cell replacement therapy may have
potential for repairing acutely injured epithelium (for example,
following ARDS and acute injury), defective epithelium (for example,
Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and SFTPC disease), and conditions
wherein the damaged epithelium activates aberrant remodeling (for
example, chronic interstitial lung disease and Birt-Hogg-Dubé syn-
drome) (3). The use of patient-specific lung progenitor cells and the
transplantation of chimeric organs may help mitigate rejection and
offer a more personalized approach to lung transplantation (fig. S8)
(4, 38). Additionally, de-epithelialization could be applied to other
organs with dual flow, such as the liver or kidney. In summary, the cre-
ation of de-epithelialized whole lungs with functional vasculature may
open new frontiers in lung bioengineering and regenerative medicine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Lungs were harvested from 12-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats weighing
250 to 350 g (Charles River Laboratories). For recellularization
experiments, 12-week-old Crl:NIH-Foxn1rnu nude rats weighing 250
to 300 g (Charles River Laboratories) were used. All animal work was
approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee and complied with the National Research Council
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (eighth edition).
Animals were euthanized via intraperitoneal injection of sodium pen-
tobarbital(140mg/kg;Sigma-Aldrich)afterheparininjection(1000U/kg;
Sagent Pharmaceuticals). Immediately after euthanasia, a median
sternotomy was performed, and the trachea was exposed and cannu-
lated using a 16- to 18-gauge catheter. Venous blood was collected from
the inferior vena cava. The right ventricle was accessed, and the PA
cannula (Harvard Apparatus) was placed directly in the PA and se-
cured with a 4-0 Prolene tie. Next, an incision was made on the in-
ferior aspect of the left ventricle, and mitral valve leaflets were
dissected open. A PV cannula (Harvard Apparatus) was placed in
the left ventricle and secured via a purse-string 4-0 Prolene suture
to collect venous drainage. For dual lung cannulation, the right
mainstem bronchus was isolated. A 5-0 Prolene tie was placed just
inferior to the carina to ensure that the right lung remained isolated
from the left. A small incision was made distal to the tie on the right
mainstem bronchus, and a second cannula was placed and secured
with 5-0 Prolene ties.
EVLP bioreactor
Bioreactor design and components
All tubing components were obtained from Pharmed (tube sizes L/S 14
andL/S16).PressurewasmonitoredusingaTruWavepressuretransducer
(EdwardsLifesciences)betweentheperfusionpumpandtheconnectionto

2 to 5% of the estimated cardiac output, with a target PA pressure of
<15mmHgandaPVpressureof3to5mmHg.Ventilationwasperformed
using a Small Animal Ventilator (Harvard Apparatus). Ventilation was
initiated within the first 10 min of isolated EVLP, with the following
initial settings: volume control mode; respiratory rate (RR), 25 bpm;
TV, 0.6 ml/100 g; positive end-expiratory pressure, 5 cmH2O; and FiO2,
21%. During de-epithelialization, lungs were ventilated using HFOV
(TV, 100 ml; RR, 150 to 180 bpm). Rat lungs were perfused with
whole blood collected during animal harvest. Hemogas analysis
was performed on blood before entry into the PA and on blood exiting

 the PV cannula to assess gas exchange (fig. S1C). Blood gas analysis was
performed using an epoc point-of-care blood analysis system (Epocal
Inc.). Once gas exchange efficacy was confirmed, lungs were directly
flushed with 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing hep-
arin (50 U/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 mg of methylprednisolone
(APP Pharmaceuticals LLC), followed by perfusion with Hepes buffer
[20 mM Hepes 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM KCl, 5% glucose,
1% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM CaCl2, and 4% dextran (70 kDa)]. In-
clusion of 4% dextran (70 kDa) maintains colloid osmotic pressure of
20 cmH2O (39, 40). Buffer pH was maintained between 7.35 and 7.45
and checked hourly.
EVLP monitoring
Pressure-volume loops of the lung were obtained during ventilation
using a custom-configured measurement system. During the measure-
ments, the trachea of the rat lung was attached to the measurement sys-
tem connected to the ventilator that supported lung ventilation. The
pressure-volume measurement system consisted of a pressure sensor
(MPXV7002GC6U, Freescale Semiconductor), an airflow sensor
(HAFBLF0200CAAX5, Honeywell), and a microcontroller (Arduino
Uno).Pressure-volumedatacollectedthroughthesystemwereprocessed,
and then pressure-volume loops were generated using MATLAB
software (MathWorks). The quasi-static compliance (milliliters per
centimeters of water) values of the lungs were determined from the
inhalation curves of the pressure-volume loops (that is, quasi-static
compliance= maximumvolume/maximumpressure duringinhalation).
Rat lung de-epithelialization
Freshly harvested lung tissues (n = 6 Sprague-Dawley rats and n = 6
nude rats) were mounted on EVLP, as described above. Both lungs were
separately cannulated. The de-epithelialization solution was intratra-
cheally injected into one lung, whereas the contralateral (control) lung
was ventilated, as described above. The de-epithelialization solution
contained4mMCHAPS(Sigma-Aldrich),0.5MNaCl(Sigma-Aldrich),
and 25 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) in deionized water. During de-
epithelialization, lungs were perfused with Hepes buffer, as described
above. During de-epithelialization, both lungs were subjected to HFOV
to allow more uniform oscillation of de-epithelialization solution
within the treated lung. After 2 hours of treatment, airways were rinsed
with washing solution {PBS and benzonase preconditioning buffer
[50 mM tris-HCl (pH 8), bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml), and
1 mM MgCl2]}. The washing solution was infused through the
airway cannula to the treated lung and let sit for the times indicated
below. Next, the airway cannula was opened, and the washing solution
was allowed to passively drain out. PBS washes were as follows: five fast
washes (1 min) and two long washes (5 min). Subsequently, airways
were rinsed twice for 10 min, each with benzonase precondition buffer,
followed by treatment with benzonase (90 U/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for
60 min to remove nucleic acids released from the cells, and then
rinsed again with PBS (as above) before processing of the samples.
Time for washing and benzonase treatment totaled 2 hours.
Rat lung complete decellularization
Freshly harvested lung tissues (n = 3 Sprague-Dawley rats) were
mounted on EVLP, as described above. Both lungs were separately
cannulated. The decellularization solution was intratracheally injected
into one lung, whereas the contralateral (control) lung was ventilated, as
described above. The decellularization solution contained 8 mM
CHAPS (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 M NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich), and 25 mM
EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) in deionized water. During decellularization,
lung perfusion and washing after treatment were performed as de-
scribed in the de-epithelialization procedure.
Cell culture
Human SAECs (Lonza) were cultured and passaged by trypsinization
and used before passage (P3). hiPSC-derived lung-specified epithelial
cells were differentiated according to previously published methods
(22, 23). hiPSCs were generated from healthy human dermal fibroblasts
using modified mRNA. mRNA hiPSCs were first prepared for definitive
endoderm induction using activin A, followed by anterior foregut
endoderm (AFE) induction with dual and sequential inhibition of bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP) and transforming growth factor–b
(TGF-b) and then by WNT and TGF-b signaling. AFE was further
cultured with lung specification medium containing a WNT signaling
agonist, fibroblastgrowthfactor10 (FGF10), FGF7, BMP4, and all-trans
retinoic acid until day 15 of differentiation, followed by expanding with
the WNT signaling agonist, FGF10, andFGF7untilday 25. From day 25,
maturation components containing dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich),
8-bromo-cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) (R&D Systems), and
3,7-dihydro-1-methyl-3-(2-methylpropyl)-1H-purine-2,6-dione (Sigma-
Aldrich) were added in addition to the WNT signaling agonist, FGF10,
and FGF7. All cytokines were from R&D Systems, and all the small mol-
ecules were purchased from Tocris (R&D Systems).
Rat lung recellularization
Prepared de-epithelialized nude rat lungs (n = 5) were rinsed in culture
medium with Antibiotic/Antimycotic (50×) (Life Technologies) and
transferred to a tissue culture incubator for culture under standard
sterile conditions at 37°C and 5% CO2. Before recellularization,
mRNA hiPSC–derived lung-specified epithelial cells at days 40 to 45
were dissociated with 0.05% trypsin gentle dissociation for 2 to 3 min,
passed through a 40-mm cell strainer, and pelleted by centrifugation.
Both SAECs and mRNA hiPSC–derived lung-specified epithelial cells
were labeled with 5 to 10 mM CFSE (Abcam) or CellBrite NIR790 cy-
toplasmic membrane dye (Biotium) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, and suspensions were prepared at a concentration of 5
to 10 × 106 cells/ml for SAECs and 2 × 106 cells/ml for hiPSC-derived
lung-specified epithelial cells. Cells were intratracheally injected in
five separate infusions of 1 ml, each with 1 min of liquid ventilation
(RR, 5 bpm) between them. Immediately after cell injection, live
transpleural imaging of NIR-labeled cells was performed using a cus-
tom imaging system developed in our laboratory that consists of a
light-emitting diode (LED) excitation source (M780L3, Thorlabs),
a camera (Zyla 4.2, Andor Technology Co.), and an objective (Plan
N 10, Olympus). Three hours after injection, liquid ventilation was
started (RR, 20 bpm). The medium in the airways was changed three
times per day. Lungs were perfused with endothelial cell growth me-
dium 2 with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 500 nM hydrocortisone
(Sigma-Aldrich), heparin (50 U/ml), and Antibiotic/Antimycotic
(50×) at 1 cm3/min. Culture periods generally varied from 24 to
48 hours.
Histopathologic analysis
The location of each lung section was standardized for every experiment
by dividing the lung into six regions (upper right, middle right, lower
right, upper left, middle left, and lower left regions) (fig. S2B). Speci-
mens from control and de-epithelialized lungs were immediately fixed
in cold phosphate–buffered 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 to 48 hours,
embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 3- or 5-mm thickness. All
sections were stained for H&E and examined under light microscopy.
Additional sections were stained for Alcian blue (pH 2.5), elastic van
Gieson, trichrome, and pentachrome at the Department of Molecular
Pathology at Columbia University.

 Immunohistochemical staining
Lung sections were deparaffinized, subjected to boiling citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval, and blocked with 10% normal goat serum
in PBS for 2 hours at room temperature. Primary antibodies were added
and incubated for 12 hours at 4°C or for 4 hours at room temperature.
For all stains, the secondary antibody was diluted 1:200 and incubated
for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were mounted in a Vecta-
shield Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories Inc.), cover-
slipped, and imaged using an Olympus FSX100 microscope (Olympus
America Inc.). Late apoptosis was detected on tissue sections from rat
lungs (n = 3) using TUNEL assay. Additional staining for vWF was con-
ducted by the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC)
molecular pathology services at Columbia University. A list of antibodies
and dilutions used is provided in tables S1 and S2.
Immunofluorescence staining and analysis
Lung slices were deparaffinized, subjected to boiling citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval, and permeabilized in PBS with
0.25% Triton X-100 and 5% fetal donkey or goat serum (Life Technol-
ogies) for 20 min. Samples were blocked in 10% fetal donkey or goat
serum for 2 hours at room temperature. Sections were stained with
one or a combination of two primary antibodies (table S1). After
blocking, all stains were performed by incubating primary antibodies
in staining/wash buffer (5% fetal goat serum in PBS) overnight at 4°C,
followed by 3× 10-min wash. Sections were incubated with the cor-
responding secondary antibodies (table S2), diluted in staining/wash
buffer for 2 hours at room temperature, washed twice for 10 min, in-
cubated with DAPI for 5 min at room temperature, and mounted with
Vectashield Mounting Medium (cat. #H-1000, Vector laboratories Inc.)
for better preservation. Percentage of recellularization was quantified by
analysis of immunofluorescence staining for Pankeratin (recognizes
both human and rat epithelial cells) on nine sections of recellularized
lungs from three independent experiments. The locations of each lung
section were standardized and were randomly selected for analysis for
every experiment (fig. S2B). The percentage of recellularization was
calculated as the number of CFSE-labeled SAECs that stained positive
for Pankeratin over the total number of Pankeratin-positive cells. Cell
counts were quantified using the ImageJ particle analysis using previ-
ously described methods (41).
Immunoblotting analysis
Lung tissue samples were lyophilized and weighed. Consistent amounts
of each sample (10 mg) were digested in a fixed volume of cold radio-
immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) with protease/
phosphatase inhibitors (Cell Signaling) for 1 hour at 4°C, followed by
centrifugation at 14,000g for 30 min at 4°C to remove insoluble mate-
rial. Cell pellets [SAECs and human umbilical cord endothelial cells
(HUVECs)] were digested in RIPA buffer, and protein concentration
was quantified via Bradford assay. Samples were reduced in Laemmli
buffer (Novex, Life Technologies) for 10 min at 70°C. Samples were
run on 4 to 12% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen); 30 mg of SAEC and
HUVEC cell extracts were loaded as control. After electrophoresis,
proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane or poly-
vinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked
for 1 hour in blocking/probing buffer (PBS with 5% nonfat dry milk,
Bio-Rad; 0.1% Tween, Sigma-Aldrich). Primary antibodieswere applied
overnight in blocking/probing buffer, followed by 3× 10-min wash in
PBS 0.1% Tween 20 (42). Secondary antibody was applied for 1 hour
at room temperature at a dilution of 1:5000, followed by three washes,
as described above. Protein signal was detected using an Odyssey 2.1
scanner.AntibodysourcesanddilutionsaredescribedintablesS1andS2.

Briefly, lung parenchymal tissue samples were weighed, homogenized,
and hydrolyzed in 12 M hydrochloric acid for 3 hours at 120°C. HOP
was subsequently assayed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
sGAG quantification
sGAGs were quantified using the dimethylene blue (DMB) dye assay.
Samples of lung parenchyma were weighed and digested in papain
(125 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 hours at 60°C. DMB dye (Sigma-

measured at 595 nm, with 540 nm as the reference wavelength, and
normalized to sample dry weight.
Elastin quantification
Elastin was quantified using the Fastin Elastin Assay Kit (Biocolor).
Briefly, lung parenchymal tissue samples were weighed, and water-
soluble a-elastin was extracted via three hot 0.25 M oxalic acid ex-
tractions, which were combined for each sample. Elastin was assayed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
DNA quantification
DNA was quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA (double-
stranded DNA) Assay Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, lung parenchymal tissue samples were weighed
and digested in papain (125 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 hours at
60°C. Fluorescence was measured with excitation/emission at 480 nm/

Samples obtained from the control and de-epithelialized lungs were
fixed in formalin, rinsed in 70% EtOH, frozen, and lyophilized. Airway
castings were obtained using a commercially available anatomical
corrosion kit (Batson’s #17, Polysciences Inc.) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Sections were imaged on a Hitachi S-4700
FE-SEM Zeiss GeminiSEM 300 with an accelerating voltage of 2.5 kV.
Transmission electron microscopy
Samples obtained from control and de-epithelialized lungs were fixed
with a modified Karmovsky’s fix (43) and a secondary fixation in re-
duced osmium tetroxide (44). Following dehydration, samples were
embedded in an open analog resin. Ultrathin sections (65 nm) were
contrasted with lead citrate stain (45) and viewed on a JEM 1400 elec-
tron microscope (JEOL USA Inc.) operated at 120 kV. Digital images
were captured on a Veleta 2kx2k charge-coupled device (Olympus Soft
Imaging Solutions) by electron microscopy at the Histology Core of
Weill Cornell Medicine.
Morphometry and stereology
Three blocks (a few millimeters in thickness) were cut from native
and de-epithelialized lungs of each animal (n = 3) at 4-mm intervals,
so that the upper, middle, and lower regions of the left and right lungs
were sampled (fig. S2B). Within each block, a 5-mm section was cut at
a random start point. Sections were mounted and stained with H&E.
Each entire lung section was imaged using a VS120 slide scanner
(Olympus) at the objective lens magnification of ×20 and a pixel size
of 0.347 mm.

 Stereologic analysis was performed using the Fiji distribution
(46) of ImageJ (47), the Multipurpose Grid macro version 1.0
(A. Mironov, University of Manchester; https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/
macros/Multipurpose_grid.txt), and custom-written scripts, available
at https://github.com/theresaswayne/stereology/releases/latest. Fields
for stereologic analysis were selected randomly from each tissue section.
To select fields, we overlaid a grid on an overview of the entire section
using the VSI Reader plugin (O. Burri and R. Guiet, École Polytech-
nique Federale de Lausanne; http://biop.epfl.ch/TOOL_VSI_Reader.
html). A Python script was written for ImageJ to select 40 random
fields (1024 pixels × 1024 pixels in size) from the grid. Random
numbers generated by the Python random module did not show
artifactual patterns, as judged by visual inspection of random numbers
rendered as pixel values in an image. The image data in each field
were extracted using the VSI Reader. After removing empty fields,
a subset of the selected fields was selected for further analysis, so
that each part of the lung was represented equally in the data set.
All measurements were carried out in a blinded fashion (fig. S9).
For volume fraction measurements, the Multipurpose Grid macro
was used to overlay point grids on each image with random offsets
(48). Intersections of points with alveolar airspace, alveolar duct
airspace, septal tissue, and nonparenchyma were counted manually
using the Multi-point tool in ImageJ. For large areas in which many
points had to be counted, a region of interest was drawn around the
area, and points were counted automatically using the particle analysis
function in ImageJ. At least 119 images were analyzed for each group
(native and de-epithelialized). The number of images analyzed and
the grid point density were selected so that each structure was
counted at least 200 times in each lung (49). Parenchymal volume was
estimated by subtracting nonparenchymal points from the total number
of points (50).
For surface density and septal thickness measurements, horizontal
segmented lines were overlaid on each image with random offsets using
the Multipurpose Grid macro (48). Intersections of septal surface with
the lines and line end points lying on nonparenchyma were counted
using the Multi-point tool. At least 119 images were analyzed for each
group (native and de-epithelialized). The number of images analyzed,
line density, and line length were set so that at least 200 intercepts were
counted in each lung.

the indicated structure. Scale factors were retrieved from the OlyVIA
desktop VSI viewer (Olympus).

Functional assays
Acetylated LDL uptake
To assess the viability of vascular endothelium, rat lungs (n = 3) were
perfused after de-epithelialization with acetylated LDL, Alexa Fluor
594 conjugate (L35353, Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted 1:200 for
4 hours at the conclusion of each experiment. Following incubation,
lungs were perfused with 1× PBS, fixed in cold phosphate–buffered
4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours, embedded in paraffin, and
sectioned at 5-mm thickness. Following deparaffinization and DAPI
staining, slides were examined using a fluorescence microscope
(Olympus FSX100).
Vascular responsiveness test
The effect of vasoconstrictor (endothelin-1) and vasodilator (treprosti-
nil) on pulmonary vascular tone was tested in de-epithelialized (n = 3)
and control (n = 3) rats. Heart-lung blocks were mounted on EVLP and
mechanically ventilated, as described above. Lungs were perfused with a
modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) with the addition of
1% fetal bovine serum, 4% dextran (70 kDa), and heparin (10 IU/ml).
Buffer was continuously gassed with 95% CO2/5% O2 at 37°C to main-
tain pH 7.4. Endothelin-1 (20 nM; Sigma-Aldrich) was intravenously
given into the PA cannula (52). PA pressure was continuously recorded,
as previously described, to assess the changes in PA pressure. In-
fusion was stopped when 100% increase in PA pressure was
achieved. Treprostinil (0.3 mM; United Therapeutics) was started,
and infusion was stopped when 20% relaxation was recorded (53).
Data were expressed as the percent change relative to the baseline
pressure (mean ± SEM) during induced response to endothelin-1 and
teprostinil infusions.
Bronchial responsiveness test
The effect of methacholine chloride (Methapharm) on bronchial mus-
cular tone was tested in de-epithelialized (n = 3) and control (n = 3) rats.
Heart-lungblockswere mounted on EVLPandmechanically ventilated,
as described above. Lungs were perfused with modified Krebs-Henseleit
buffer, as described above. Methacholine was added to the buffer at a
concentration of 16 mg/kg per min for 15 min (54). Pressure-volume
loops were recorded before infusion and at 5-, 10-, and 15-min time
points from infusion. Plateau was reached at 10 min and maintained
at 15 min.
FITC-dextran perfusion and BAL assay
FITC-dextran (500 kDa) (Sigma) perfusion assay was performed, as
previously described (21). Dextran perfusion and BAL assay were per-
formed on freshly isolated (n = 3), fully decellularized (n = 3), and
de-epithelialized (n = 3) rat lungs.

 Ex vivo lung vasculature perfusion with microspheres
Fluorescent microspheres (excitation/emission, 580 nm/605 nm;
diameter, 0.2 mm; FluoSpheres F-8821, Thermo Fisher Scientific)
were suspended in 1× PBS at a final concentration of 106 beads/ml.
At the appropriate experimental time points, the microsphere solution
was introduced into the vascular tree of lungs mounted on EVLP.
Following the injection, rat lungs (n = 3) were placed on a petri dish,
and the microspheres within the blood vessels were imaged using a
custom-built microscope, which consisted of an excitation light
source (M595L3, Thorlabs), an emission filter (FF02-641/75-25,
Semrock), a 40× water immersion lens (CFI APO NIR 40×, 0.80
numerical aperture, 3.5-mm working distance; Nikon), and an
sCMOS camera (Zyla 4.2, Andor).
Metabolic activity assay
Lung tissue from upper, middle, and lower regions were randomly
selected from rat lungs cultured in the bioreactor for 24 to 48 hours
(n = 3). Two-millimeter-diameter punch biopsies (n = 4) from each
region were dissected in a sterile fashion, finely minced, and placed
in a 96-well plate (BD Falcon). CellTiter-Blue Cell Viability Assay
(Promega) reagent diluted 1:5 was added to each sample suspended
in 100 ml of 1× Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s cell culture medium with
10% FBS. Negative control contained only medium. The multiwell plate
was covered with aluminum foil and incubated at 37°C with gentle
shakingfor4hours.Followingincubation,wellcontentsweretransferred
into new 96-well plates, and absorbance was measured at 570 nm and
normalized to 600 nm. Following the metabolic activity assay, the DNA
content of each sample was quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen
dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Samples were digested in papain (250 mg/ml) for 4 hours at 60°C
and mixed with PicoGreen reagent. Fluorescence emission was mea-
sured at 520 nm with excitation at 480 nm, and DNA was quantified
using a standard curve.
Study design and statistical analysis
The study was conducted with the minimum number of animals to
achieve reproducibility and statistical significance between time points
(at least three animals per experiment).
Randomization of sampling
Samples of lung collected for histologic, microscopic, and pathologic
analyses were collected at the end of each experiment according to a
predetermined lung map (fig. S2B). A grid was overlaid over a section
slide, and 20× magnified images were chosen for analysis after they had
been numbered by a random number generator (www.random.org).
Blinded review
All analytical assessments were blinded to the maximum practical
extent. Pathologic analysis was performed by a blinded independent
expert to eliminate any bias.
Student’s t testswere performed using Prism v6 (GraphPad). A value
of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
