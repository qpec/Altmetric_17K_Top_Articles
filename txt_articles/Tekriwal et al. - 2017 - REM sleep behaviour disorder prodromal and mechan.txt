ABSTRACT
Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder
(RBD) is characterised by complex motor enactment of
dreams and is a potential prodromal marker of
Parkinson’s disease (PD). Of note, patients with PD
observed during RBD episodes exhibit improved motor
function, relative to baseline states during wake periods.
Here, we review recent epidemiological and mechanistic
findings supporting the prodromal value of RBD for PD,
incorporating clinical and electrophysiological studies.
Explanations for the improved motor function during
RBD episodes are evaluated in light of recent
publications. In addition, we present preliminary findings
describing changes in the activity of the basal ganglia
across the sleep–wake cycle that contribute to our
understanding of RBD.
As in every other disease, so here, the earlier the
remedies are resorted to, the greater will be the
probability of success.

REM SLEEP BEHAVIOUR DISORDER
Background
Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour dis-
order (RBD) is categorised as a parasomnia, the
group of sleep disturbances that is characterised by
the occurrence of atypical motor, behavioural or
cognitive events, occurring at any time between
transitioning to sleep and waking. Other parasom-
nias
include
somnambulism,
recurrent
isolated
sleep paralysis and sleep-related hallucinations. In
RBD, patients, typically men aged 60–70 years, do
not
experience
the
electromyographic
(EMG)
atonia that accompanies physiological REM sleep.1
The pathological lack of atonia is termed REM
sleep without atonia (RSWA).2 The lack of atonia is
associated with complex motor enactment of vivid,
often
frightening
dreams,
that
can
result
in
sleep-related injury (SRI) to patients as well as to
their sleeping partners. One study of 41 patients
with RBD reported that 46% of patients injured
themselves and 34% injured their sleeping partners
during RSWA episodes.3 During motor enactment,
patients may sing, laugh, punch, kick or cry out.
Falling out of bed is a common cause of SRI, often
resulting in contusions, with the potential for more
serious events, including traumatic brain injuries
and subdural haematomas in severe cases. The pres-
ence of RBD can have a significant negative impact
on quality of life, as repeated SRI can cause antici-
patory anxiety for, and fear of, falling asleep.4
Modifying sleeping arrangements is the only RBD
treatment recommended by the American Academy
of Sleep Medicine (AASM), while pharmacological
interventions with clonazepam and melatonin are
suggested, but carry risks or are not as well sup-
ported, respectively.5 Evidence for several therapies
was
graded
using
the
Oxford
Centre
for
Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence by a
specially convened AASM task force in 2010, with
only
modification
of
sleeping
arrangements
meeting criteria for the highest treatment recom-
mendation, Level A.5 Reflecting these findings,
many uncontrolled patients sleep separate from
their partners and move mattresses to the floor to
decrease risk of falls. Some resort to more inventive
methods, including wearing oven mitts over their
hands to prevent scratching or fully restraining
themselves to prevent bolting out of bed. Officially
recognised as a medical diagnosis in 1990, the diag-
nostic criteria and understanding of RBD are still
evolving.
Published in March 2014, the most recent iter-
ation of the International Classification of Sleep
Disorders (ICSD) lists 10 core categories of para-
somnias, in which only RBD requires a polysomno-
graph (PSG) for diagnosis.2 PSG is a commonly
performed, multimetric, diagnostic test used to
identify sleep-associated illnesses such as RBD: in
the setting of a clinical sleep laboratory, physio-
logical
information,
including
EEG,
electro-
oculogram (EOG),
electromyogram (EMG) and
pulse oximetry, are collected over the course of a
night’s sleep. These physiological recordings are
then scored per well-established AASM criteria,
with diagnoses based on quantifiable objective data.
PSG results are displayed as a stair plot with each
plateau corresponding to the wake, REM, N1, N2
or N3 state, and transitions between states are
represented as vertical lines. A representative stair
plot is shown in figure 1 (red line). RBD is formally
defined by the presence of dream enactment behav-
iour (DEB) and RSWA. Although patient history or
bed partner interview may confirm DEB, the diag-
nosis of RSWA—and therefore RBD—rests on the
presence
of
EMG
abnormalities
during
REM
sleep.2
6 A single-question screen for RBD, the
REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder Single-Question
Screen (RBD1Q), has demonstrated impressive sen-
sitivity (93.8%, with 95% CI 90.0 to 96.2) and
specificity (87.2%, with 95% CI 82.4 to 90.8),
when compared to gold-standard PSG diagnosis,
but the RBD1Q is not part of recognised diagnostic
criteria.7

 Because of the requirement for PSG confirmation to establish
the diagnosis of RBD, the true prevalence of RBD is unclear,
but estimates range from 0.38% to 0.5% according to DSM-V
.
EMG abnormalities necessary for the diagnosis of RBD are
defined as an excess of muscle tone and/or phase twitch during
REM sleep. Specific scoring guidelines as to what constitutes
‘abnormal’ EMG findings are moving from qualitative to quanti-
tative criteria.6 Although RBD episodes may vary widely in dur-
ation, findings suggest the majority last <2 min, and occur at a
frequency of <1 per week.3 Within the RBD, diagnosis are
more nuanced classifications of subclinical, clinically probable,
idiopathic and secondary RBD, with recent efforts to character-
ise ‘prodromal’ RBD. Secondary RBD refers to the concurrent
presence of another neurological condition such as a PD.2 6
However, idiopathic RBD (iRBD) occurs in the absence of such
conditions and is known to precede PD and other neurodegen-
erative synucleinopathies such as Lewy body dementia (LBD) or
multiple system atrophy (MSA), by as much as 50 years with a
well-documented average of 5–10.8–10 Generally, 50–75% of
patients who present with iRBD will go on to develop PD
within 10 years of iRBD diagnosis.8–10 In 2014, Iranzo et al8
reported that 90.9% of 174 patients diagnosed with iRBD,
developed
a
defined
neurodegenerative
syndrome
within
14 years. This powerful finding holds promise for diagnosing
PD earlier in the disease course.
PD and prodromal value
W
ell-established clinical criteria are used to diagnose PD, but due
to heterogeneous presentation and the existence of closely
related disorders, diagnosis can be challenging. Pathognomonic
for PD is the presence of intraneuronal α-synuclein protein accu-
mulation, but the risk-to-benefit calculus currently supports diag-
nosis based on clinical criteria rather than confirmatory brain
biopsy.11 When the aetiology of PD cannot be attributed to spe-
cific genetics or strong familial history, postmortem neuropatho-
logical confirmation is required to establish the diagnosis of PD
with rigour.12 Recent evidence suggests that α-synuclein may be
found in peripheral tissues and skin allowing for less invasive
confirmation, but validation is required.13 The absence of a
simple, validated, in vivo, diagnostic test for PD poses a major
obstacle to treatment and advancing research, as therapies and
outcomes can be very different for PD compared to closely
related disorders, such as MSA. Effective early diagnosis must
allow the identification of PD among an even larger cohort of
related neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Early
diagnosis will be crucial for instituting treatments that can halt,
slow or reverse disease course. Current treatments, such as levo-
dopa and deep brain stimulation (DBS), can help manage motor
symptoms, but are not proven to affect disease course. However,
these treatments are currently implemented sometimes after
motor symptom onset, when neurodegeneration has already led
to 50–70% loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia
nigra pars compacta (SNc). Appreciably altering disease course
from this late-stage degeneration has been unsuccessful, leading
to efforts to reliably diagnose PD at earlier stages. Longitudinal
PD studies have attempted to recognise markers that consistently
manifest before motor symptoms, identifying declines in working
memory
, visuospatial processing and bradyphrenia, beginning
∼5 years prior to motor deterioration. However, these signs are
not specific to PD and difficult to disentangle from cognitive
decline associated with other aetiologies.12 Historically, the lack
of unambiguous, prodromal features specific to PD has posed a
major barrier to effective treatment, but in the last 20 years
several potential prodromal biomarkers have been recognised.
The identification of PD prodromal biomarkers is largely due
to a reconsideration of the importance of nonmotor symptoms
(NMS) in PD pathogenesis and management. Interest in NMS
has arisen through the realisation of their cumulative burden on
patient mood, daily activities and quality of life. In 2010, the
American Academy of Neurology released a 10-point quality
measure recommendation, with half of these points pertaining
to NMS, and citing gaps in assessment despite the strong associ-
ation between NMS and quality of life.14 Following this recom-
mendation, NMS are now recognised to present in predictable
constellations correlating with younger or older PD age-of-onset
(defined as onset before 45 years or after 65 years, respectively).
Specifically, anosmia, constipation, urinary urgency, nocturia,
hallucinations and components of RBD are generally more

 common in older-age onset PD, while young-onset PD may be
more associated with restless leg and excessive sweating.15
Along with these observations came the realisation that many
NMS manifest several decades prior to PD-related motor symp-
toms, shifting their clinical value from treatment targets to
potential prodromal markers.11 Among NMS, anosmia, consti-
pation and sleep disturbances, such as RBD, are the most exten-
sively characterised. Considering these findings, in 2015, the
International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS)
released research diagnostic criteria for the prodromal phase of
PD.16 Among the PD risk factors are male sex, exposure to pes-
ticides and family history, while prodromal markers range from
olfactory loss to orthostatic hypotension. Using these criteria
retrospectively to assess a patient cohort (N=488), Mahlknecht
et al17 found a 5-year 60% positive predictive value for incident
PD. Traits found to be most predictive included family history,
substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, olfactory loss and symptom-
atic hypotension. Because of the retrospective nature of this
study, costly and time-consuming examinations included in the
MDS criteria that would potentially have improved predictive
accuracy—such as PSG-determined iRBD—were not assessed.
Investigations into the MDS prodromal criteria have led to the
finding that iRBD has particularly high sensitivity and specificity
for conversion to synucleinopathies, in contrast to other pro-
dromal markers such as constipation and anosmia. Further investi-
gations have
found
biological
bases
for the high
rate
of
iRBD-to-PD conversion. Imaging studies have identified significant
changes in brainstem white matter in iRBD patients compared to
controls, and specifically in brain regions affected by PD, including
the substantia nigra and olfactory cortex.18 Additional work has
implicated
brainstem
regions,
including
the
sublaterodorsal
nucleus, laterodorsal tegmental, pericoerulear, pedunculopontine
nuclei (PPN) and ventrolateral reticulospinal tracts, in RBD patho-
genesis.1 19 A single-photon emission CT (SPECT) and transcra-
nial sonography imaging study conducted by Iranzo et al,20
followed 43 patients with iRBD over a period of 2.5 years, with
27 patients displaying either reduced dopamine (DA) transporter
uptake or hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra—both physio-
logical changes seen in early PD—and 8 of 27 patients developing
a neurodegenerative disease within 2.5 years (5 of 8 developed
PD). Patients with iRBD who did not present with abnormal
imaging findings did not go on to develop PD or related disorders.
The ability to distinguish those patients with iRBD who will ultim-
ately develop synucleinopathies is of obvious importance. The
connection between RBD and PD has been further strengthened
by the recent finding of PD-associated memory impairments in
individuals with iRBD.21 These findings support the notion that
iRBD is a prodromal PD biomarker—not only because of linear
conversion, but also because of associated functional and behav-
ioural changes prior to the onset of PD motor symptoms.
While the utility of iRBD in prodromal identification of PD is
increasing substantiated, it should be noted that although iRBD
has shown a high rate of conversion to synucleinopathies, only a
minority of newly diagnosed PD cases show RBD.22 This is
likely reflective of the heterogeneous aetiology of PD, with
iRBD indicative of some subpopulation of all mechanisms of PD
development. Although this indicates that iRBD is not a pro-
dromal marker for all types of PD, it also provides a means to
differentiate between subtypes of PD, which may have implica-
tions for treatment.
Insights into PD pathogenesis
The value of iRBD in elucidating PD pathogenesis stems from a
detailed understanding of the brainstem: functional deficits can
be tied to pathologies at well-defined anatomical locations
without the need for imaging. The resolution of this under-
standing is high for sleep–wake cycling, as recently evidenced by
successful optogenetic control of the REM phenomenon via
modulation of the dorsal medulla GABAergic neurons in
rodents.23 Studies characterising the location of RBD deficits
point to locus coeruleus (LC) and related areas as lesion sites.
Since RBD appears well in advance of symptomatic dopamin-
ergic neurodegeneration of SNc, it is possible that this relation-
ship describes the caudal-to-rostral directionality of a larger
disease process. The Braak Staging Model describes such a time-
line, proposing that constipation and anosmia present even
before the sleep disturbances of PD, as a consequence of the
more peripheral location their respective nervous system control
centres.11 Clinical evidence from patients with iRBD supports
Braak’s hypothesis that neurodegeneration via α-synuclein mis-
folding may arise in the periphery and progress centrally up
through to the cortex.11 The timeline of onset of idiopathic
anosmia to RBD to PD does not describe all patients; however,
raising the possibility that for each pattern of prodromal
symptom presentation, there is a corresponding, distinct PD
aetiology. Possibly, neuroprotective interventions will not be
uniform in their impact across these groups. Because of the rela-
tively high rates of conversion of iRBD into PD, patients with
iRBD are well suited to aid in the development, and to assess
the efficacy, of neuroprotective therapies. Recently published
work by Postuma et al24 quantified the number of iRBD patients
needed to prove significant reduction in neurodegeneration
assuming a therapy provided a modest HR of 0.5, finding that a
sample size of fewer than 80 patients would be sufficient.
Insights into movement processing
Evaluations of patients with RBD-PD have provided insights
into
the
underlying
neural
mechanism
of
movement.
Improvements in patient movement and speech during RBD epi-
sodes have been reported, relative to awake periods.3
25 In
2007, De Cock et al reported on 53 patients with RBD-PD,
with 100% of bed partners reporting improvement of at least 1
component of motor function during RBD episodes. These
authors suggest that the levodopa-like improvement in motor
symptoms during RBD may be attributable to primary motor
cortex activity bypassing the inhibitory role of the subthalamic
nucleus (STN) and eventually transmitting to lower motor
neurons.3 Ictal SPECT imaging has supported the hypothesis
that the basal ganglia are bypassed during RBD episodes, as
well.26 In 2011, De Cock et al published a study evaluating
RBD in patients with MSA, reporting that patients with MSA
similarly improved motor control during RBD episodes. In con-
trast to PD, patients with MSA respond to levodopa for only 2–
3 years—if at all—suggesting that motor improvement during an
RBD episode is not mediated through DA signalling, or at least
not exclusively.25 Transient RBD-associated improvements in
motor
function
bear
a
resemblance
to
another
movement-related phenomenon—that of paradoxic kinesis (PK).
During PK, spontaneous, transient motor improvement accom-
panies intense stimuli. Certain behavioural paradigms have been
found to reproducibly provoke PK-like improvements in motor
control, allowing researchers to evaluate this phenomenon in
the clinical setting.27
Application of these paradigms to patients undergoing DBS
surgery is particularly interesting because it is possible to have
implanted patients perform tasks while recording the neuronal
activity of nuclei such as STN or globus pallidus internus (GPi).
Activity is measured using electrophysiological signals, including

 single-unit potential and local field potential (LFP). LFPs are
oscillations thought to represent the aggregate discharges from
neurons within the immediate vicinity of recording sites.28 29
LFP can be recorded through the same macroelectrode contacts
used to deliver stimulation via DBS. Recordings are most often
performed intraoperatively, but can be collected chronically,
years after surgery.29 30 Analysis of LFP recordings has led to
the identification of a number of electrophysiological findings
correlated
with
PD
states
and
symptoms,
and
has
elucidated aspects of basal ganglia function. For example, the
β-band (13–30 Hz) of the LFP spectrum has greater power in
the OFF medication and OFF stimulation states. In comparison,
the converse has been reported for γ (60–90 Hz) power. β is
often regarded as ‘antikinetic’, because it is present when
patients are in an OFF state or at rest, and decreases in spectral
power during motor planning and execution. Conversely, γ is
considered ‘prokinetic’ because its spectral power increases with
the initiation of movement relative to rest. This information has
led to clinically useful advances in PD patient care and DBS
device design.31 Using LFP recordings in conjunction with
PK-inducing behavioural paradigms allows clinicians to examine
whether known DA-related changes in basal ganglia activity can
explain PK-related improvements in movement. Reporting on
such a study in 2012, Anzak et al27 were unable to connect PK
to DA, supporting the presence of a DA-independent modifying
circuit. Candidates for this DA-independent modifying circuit
include the brainstem reticular-activating system and PPN, with
recently reported recording from PPN (n=1) during a PK task
supporting this hypothesis.32 These reports have helped high-
light the relative contributions of dopaminergic and non-
dopaminergic control on movement processing, largely arising
from analysis of patients with RBD-PD.
LFP recordings from STN and/or PPN in patients experien-
cing an RBD episode could prove an invaluable contribution to
this field. Few reports to date have attempted to provide charac-
terisation of changes in the activity of deep brain structures rela-
tive to arousal state. T
o the best of our knowledge, only two
publications describe deep brain LFP spectral changes with
respect to sleep stage.33 34 In 2009, Urrestarazu et al33 reported
the first characterisation of STN activity with respect to sleep
stage, identifying 3–8-s long segments in 3 of 10 patients as
periods of RSW
A, based on EMG of limb muscles (figure 2).
β-Band during REM was found by these investigators to be com-
parable or higher than awake periods, and significantly greater
than in other sleep stages (figure 3). Comparing RSWA segments
to atonic segments during REM sleep, the authors found power
in the β-band to be greater during RSW
A segments (figure 2).
Although RBD was not explicitly assessed, the increase in β
during RSW
A identified by Urrestarazu et al would likely also be
present during RBD episodes. These findings might support the
existence of a non-DA-modifying circuit because if dopamin-
ergic control at the level of STN and related structures were
solely responsible for PD motor symptoms, we would expect to
see a worsening of motor function during RSWA/RBD, rather
than the reported improvements, because of the known increase
in β during REM and RSWA. As acknowledged by the authors,
conclusions from this study are limited because video recordings
corresponding to the RSWA periods did not demonstrate clear
patient movement, raising questions about the diagnosis of
RSWA. Furthermore, specifics on how the diagnosis of RSW
A
was determined, beyond the presence of an abnormal EMG,
were not delineated. At present, the data provided in the
Urrestarazu et al publication are most rigorous description of
STN LFP spectral changes over the sleep–wake cycle available.
Additional reports on this subject would likely have a high
impact on the understanding of STN function as well as RBD.
The cost and challenges of performing LFP recordings from
awake, implanted patients during an operative procedure are
not trivial, but expanding the duration of a DBS surgery to
capture recordings during sleep is neither feasible nor ethical.
Alternatively, capturing sleep cycle LFP data from patients
chronically implanted with a research device that stimulates and
records (Medtronic PC+S) is technically feasible, but currently
consumes significant battery life. Nonetheless, detailed charac-
terisation of LFP spectral changes across sleep stages would
provide an idea of the predictive value of basal ganglia LFP in
relation to sleep–wake states. Components of such an analysis of
unilateral STN LFP recordings from 10 PD participants, with
concurrent overnight PSG captured during a full night of sleep,
are shown in figures 1, 4 and 5. DBS surgery was performed as
previously
described,
and
data
were
collected
using
an
XLTEK-EMU40 system.30

36 The following montage was
used for sleep evaluation according to the 2007 American
Academy of Sleep Medicine guidelines: F3-C3, P3-O1, F4-C4
and P4-O2, LEOG-O2, REOG-O1 and chin EMG.37 38 In brief,
our analysis supports the finding that changes in STN activity
tightly correlate with PSG-determined sleep–waking transitions
and with specific sleep stages (figure 1). Of note, in figure 1, the
β-band (13–30 Hz) appears to reflect dynamic changes in spec-
tral power across sleep–waking and REM–NREM transitions.
Frequency-specific analysis shows that changes in β are greatest
in
the
lower
half
of
the
frequency
range
(figure
4).
Furthermore, quantitative analysis of β-power across awake and
sleep states demonstrates greater power during REM compared
to other sleep stages within participant (figure 5). This relation-
ship is also observed in preliminary group analysis (n=10).
Median values for per cent of total spectral power (0–350 Hz)
along with 25% (Q1) and 75% (Q3) quartiles for group analysis
(n=10) are as follows (median, Q1, Q3): REM (29%, 20%,
38%), N1 (18%, 12%, 25%), N2 (8%, 6%, 11%) and N3 (5%,
4.5%, 6.5%).
Shortcomings
Although iRBD has strong epidemiological and increasingly con-
vincing mechanistic evidence supporting its use as a PD bio-
marker, there are some caveats to consider. RBD almost
exclusively affects male patients (nearly 90%) over the age of
50. The strong bias towards presentation in men may represent
underdiagnosis in women—due perhaps to a less obvious pres-
entation of DEB in women, or gender-based discrepancies in
reporting or history taking—but alternative explanations to this
male predominance include a sex-linked genetic aetiology.
Reports indicating that PD NMS might be attributable to endo-
crine dysfunction led to the hypothesis that RBD, with its high
proportion of male patients, is caused by testosterone defi-
ciency.39 However, in 2007, Chou et al40 assayed testosterone
levels in patients with PD+RBD versus patients with PD, report-
ing
no
significant
differences.
Regardless,
the
discrepancy
between iRBD and PD patient demographics suggests that the
utility of tracking iRBD-to-PD conversion would extend only to
a subset of patients with PD.
Additionally, although iRBD most often converts to PD, it can
also precede the diagnosis of LBD and MSA. This lack of speci-
ficity is not unique to RBD, as other prodromal PD features
such as anosmia or constipation are also known to be associated
with multiple diagnoses, including Alzheimer’s disease. Even a
hypothetical biomarker based on blood or cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) would likely lack the resolution to differentiate between

awareness for the significance of RBD in predicting a subsequent
Parkinsonian disorder could enhance self-monitoring and sleep-
ing partner monitoring and reporting. Less expensive and less
intrusive methods, aimed at distinguishing which patients with
iRBD are likely to convert to synucleinopathies, need to be
developed. In parallel, animal model and clinical electrophysio-
logical experiments aimed at deciphering STN/GPi spectral
activity during RBD episodes are needed to further elucidate the
role of a non-dopaminergic movement processing circuit. This
may lead to novel pharmaceutical and/or DBS targets for move-
ment disorders, while contributing to our understanding move-
ment processing.

Figure 4
Spectral power of STN LFP β-band (13–30 Hz) across PSG-determined sleep–awake states for individual participant. REM β-power closer
in magnitude to wake states than other sleep stages. LFP, local field potential; PSG, polysomnograph; STN, subthalamic nucleus.
Figure 5
Notched box plot
quantifying spectral power in STN LFP
β-band (13–30 Hz) across
PSG-determined sleep–awake states
for individual participant (same
participant as in figure 4). Midbox
horizontal lines represent the median,
with the notch representing the 95%
CI for the median. The lower and
upper extremes of the boxes represent
25% (Q1) and 75% (Q3) quartiles,
respectively, with the difference
between Q1 and Q3 representing the
IQR. Lower boxplot whisker extends to
(Q1–IQR) and upper boxplot whisker
extends to (Q3+IQR). LFP, local field
potential; PSG, polysomnograph; STN,
subthalamic nucleus.
