Abstract
Strong epidemiologic evidence documents the protective effect
of physical activity on breast cancer risk, recurrence, and mortality,
but the underlying mechanisms remain to be identified. Using
human exercise–conditioned serum for breast cancer cell incu-
bation studies and murine exercise interventions, we aimed
to identify exercise factors and signaling pathways involved
in the exercise-dependent suppression of breast cancer. Exer-
cise-conditioned serum from both women with breast cancer
(n ¼ 20) and healthy women (n ¼ 7) decreased MCF-7 (hor-
mone-sensitive) and MDA-MB-231 (hormone-insensitive) breast
cancer cell viability in vitro by 11% to 19% and reduced tumor-
igenesis by 50% when preincubated MCF-7 breast cancer cells
were inoculated into NMRI-Foxn1nu mice. This exercise-mediated
suppression of cell viability and tumor formation was completely
blunted by blockade of b-adrenergic signaling in MCF-7 cells,
indicating that catecholamines were the responsible exercise
factors. Both epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NE) could
directly inhibit breast cancer cell viability, as well as tumor
growth in vivo. EPI and NE activate the tumor suppressor Hippo
signaling pathway, and the suppressive effect of exercise-
conditioned serum was found to be mediated through phosphor-
ylation and cytoplasmic retention of YAP and reduced expression
of downstream target genes, for example, ANKRD1 and CTGF. In
parallel, tumor-bearing mice with access to running wheels
showed reduced growth of MCF-7 (–36%, P < 0.05) and MDA-
MB-231 (–66%, P < 0.01) tumors and, for the MCF-7 tumor,
increased regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway. Taken
together, our findings offer a mechanistic explanation for
exercise-dependent suppression of breast cancer cell growth.

Introduction
Persuasive epidemiologic evidence has emerged over the recent
years outlining an inverse association between self-reported phys-
ical activity level and the risk of breast cancer (1–4). Moreover,
physically active women diagnosed with breast cancer have lower
risk of disease recurrence, as well as overall and cancer-specific
mortality relative to their sedentary counterparts (5–9). This
protection has been demonstrated for physical activity performed
both before and after the patients' cancer diagnosis. As a conse-
quence, this body of evidence has created the basis for cancer-
specific exercise guidelines, recommending women to participate
in exercise of moderate intensity for 150 minutes per week
following a breast cancer diagnosis (10).
While observational data support a protective effect of physical
exercise on breast cancer risk, recurrence, and mortality, limited
mechanistic work has been published elucidating the potential
biological pathways, driving this protection. Long-term reduc-
tions in various circulatory risk factors, for example, sex hor-
mones, metabolic hormones, and low-grade inflammation, all
of which are associated with weight loss, have gained consider-
able attention while linking the protective effect of exercise on
cancer (11). However, our group recently highlighted that, in
contrast to the long-term adaptations in breast cancer risk factors,
acute changes in circulating exercise factors during a single exercise
bout could reduce breast cancer cell viability by approximately
10% (12). This discovery has prompted us to conduct a compre-
hensive investigation into the antioncogenic potential of the acute
systemic exercise response to identify exercise-induced cancer-
controlling pathways and their exercise-dependent stimulants.
Against this background, we have performed the current study
to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the control of
breast cancer viability and tumorigenesis through circulating
factors induced during exercise. We have utilized in vitro models
of the two breast cancer cell lines; MCF-7 [estrogen receptors (ER)
and progesterone receptors (PR) positive and categorized within
the largest subgroup of luminal breast cancer tumors], and MDA-
MB-231 (triple negative for sex hormone receptors and represent-
ing a basal-like subgroup of breast cancer tumors; ref. 13). These
two cell lines were incubated with human serum taken at rest or
immediately after an acute exercise bout or with catecholamines;
or used as inoculated tumors in wheel running interventions in

 mice. Our primary objectives were to: (i) identify responsible
intratumoral pathways involved in acute exercise-dependent inhi-
bition of breast cancer cell growth; (ii) identify plausible exercise-
dependent circulatory candidates stimulating these pathways;
and (iii) investigate the potential differences between breast
cancer cell subtypes, representing differences in sex hormone
receptor status.
Patients and Methods
Human studies
Subjects. Human studies were performed at Copenhagen Univer-
sity in the period 2011–2014, according to the Declaration
of Helsinki and after approval by the local ethical committee
(H-3-2010-141). Written informed consent was obtained from all
participants included in the studies. For the purpose of this study,
we collected exercise-conditioned serum from healthy women
and breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy,
recruited in two different settings:
Two-hour acute exercise session in healthy women. Healthy women
(n ¼ 7) were recruited to participate in a one day acute exercise
intervention combined with a nonexercise resting day trial. Inclu-
sion criteria were: age between 18 and 30 years, no medication or
oral contraceptives, nonsmokers, and normal weight. All partici-
pants completed the two test days and baseline characteristics
were; age: 24.6 (1.0) years, BMI: 23.3 (2.7) kg/m2, and VO2peak:
44.5 (7.0) mL/kg/min [mean (SD)].
Two-hour acute exercise study in breast cancer patients receiving
adjuvant chemotherapy. The participants of this study have previ-
ously been described (12). Briefly, women operated for stage I/II
breast cancer and receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (n ¼ 20) were
recruited from the 6-week standard exercise rehabilitation pro-
gram at the Copenhagen University Hospital (the Body and
Cancer Program; ref. 14). Baseline characteristics of the subjects
were; age: 49.5 (7.3) years, BMI: 26.0 (5.2) kg/m2, and VO2peak:
25.2 (8.3) mL/kg/min [mean (SD)]. The women were provided
with oral and written information about the project, and had
several days to decide on their participation. Once the patients
had signed written consent, the experimental day was planned,
aiming to take place halfway through the 6 weeks of training
within the Body and Cancer program. In addition, it was ensured
that the test day took place more than 7 days since last chemo-
therapy administration and with �2 days since last supervised
exercise session.
Exercise interventions
Two-hour acute exercise session in healthy women. Participants
came to the laboratory 3 times. On day 1, a medical examination
and physiologic measures, including a VO2peak test were per-
formed. VO2peak was measured directly by indirect calorimetry
with a Cosmed Quark CPET system, after an incremental exercise
test on a stationary cycle ergometer (Monark Ergomedic 839E).
Following 5 minutes of warm-up at steady state, the incremental
test was initiated at a baseline workload of Watts followed by 20
Watts increments every minute until volitional exhaustion, where
Wattmax, maximum heart rate (HRmax) and VO2peak were
recorded. On day 2, the women rested throughout the stay and
had blood samples drawn after 1 and 2 hours, which were
immediately processed to serum and stored on –80�C until
further use. On day 3, they performed an acute bout of ergometer
cycling at 55% of VO2peak for 2 hours. Blood samples were drawn
on the same time points as on day 2. Experimental day 2 and 3
were scheduled between day 7 and 12 of the women's menstrual
cycle. Participants were fasting overnight for all experimental days
and had refrained from physical exercise for 24 hours. Training
intensity was documented by heart rate monitoring, showing
heart rate levels above 70% of HRmax throughout the exercise
bout (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Two-hour acute exercise study in breast cancer patients. On the test
day, the patients participated as normal in the Body and Cancer
program, which consisted of 30-minute warm up, 1 hour resis-
tance whole body training, and 30 minutes of high intensity
spinning (pulse > 80% of HRmax) on stationary ergometer
bicycles. The participants were asked to fast 2 hours prior to the
exercise intervention. Blood samples were collected just before
the program and immediately after the spinning program, and
were processed to serum and stored on –80�C.
Biochemical profile. Serum concentrations of IL6 were measured
by ELISA(Meso Scale Discovery), lactate byABL 800 flex blood gas
analyzer (Radiometer), and EPI/NE by 2-CAT RIA kit (LDN), all
according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Cell culture studies
Cancer cell lines. The human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines
MCF-7 (ERþ, PRþ, HER2–) and MDA-MB-231 (ER–, PR–, HER2–)
were cultured in DMEM, 1 g/L glucose (Invitrogen), 10% FBS
(Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). The
in vitro studies were performed from 2014 to 2017. The two cell
lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) were obtained from ATCC,
which authenticates via short tandem repeat profiling. Upon
receipt, cells were expanded and frozen in multiple vials and
subsequently used for experiments within the same six passages
(P14–P19). Both cell lines were periodically tested for mycoplas-
ma by the MycoProbe kit (R&D Systems), and found negative. The
cell lines were authenticated by routinely visual inspection of the
morphologic phenotype. For all cell stimulation experiments,
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in 96-well plates at
concentrations 1 � 103 and 2 � 103 cells/well, respectively, in
their normal growth media. After attachment to bottom of plate
(6 hours), cells were serum starved overnight (18 hours).
Viability assays. To study the effect on cancer cells of human
exercise-conditioned serum, viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-
231 were measured by quantification of live proteases by CellTi-
ter-Fluor cell viability assay (Promega). Quality control of the
assay was performed before the actual experiments by plotting
fluorescence signal against serial dilutions of cell counts (data not
shown). Starvation media were replaced by growth media con-
taining 10% human serum obtained at rest or after exercise in
healthy women or breast cancer patients instead of FBS. All
stimulations were performed in triplets. For the propranolol
incubation study, 10% human serum obtained from breast cancer
patients
pre/post
exercise
�
propranolol
(Sigma
Aldrich;
10 mmol/L) was added to the medium. Stimulated cells were
incubated for 48 hours. Cells were added to 100 mL viability
reagents, mixed by orbital shaking, and incubated for 1 hour
at 37�C. For viability evaluation, fluorescence was measured at
400Ex/505Em.

 For evaluation of the growth-inhibitory effect of EPI and NE,
viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were measured by both
MTT assay (Promega) and by confluence (% fraction of area),
quantified as a mean of three images/well in 3 wells by the image
processing program ImageJ. Starvation media were replaced by
growth media containing 0, 0.1, 1, or 10 mmol/L EPI or NE, and
media were changed daily throughout the experiments. MTT
assays were performed according to manufacturer's protocol after
24, 48, and 72 hours of stimulation. Measure of confluence was
performed after 48 hours of EPI/NE (10 mmol/L) stimulation.
Cellular localization by fluorescence microscopy. For visualization
of the cellular localization of YAP, MCF-7 cells were stimulated
with medium containing 10% rest or exercise-conditioned serum
from breast cancer patients for 1 hour. Medium was removed and
the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde fixative solution
(Sigma Aldrich) and incubated for 15 minutes. The cells were
washed, added 0.5% Triton X-100 solution (Sigma Aldrich) and
incubated for another 15 minutes before blocking in 3% BSA for
60 minutes. After washing, the cells were stained with YAP
antibody (63.7; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, # sc-101199) for
1 hour and AlexaFluor secondary antibody (Molecular Probes),
before costaining with DAPI and Actin (Molecular Probes). Fluo-
rescence was visualized by EVOS FL microscope.
Animal models
All mice studies were approved by the Danish Research Animal
Inspectorate and conducted in accordance with the recommenda-
tions of the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate
Animals used for Experimentation. Female NMRI-Foxn1nu mice
(own breed) were housed in standard housing cages and were
between 12 and 22 weeks old when the studies were initiated. The
mice were maintained in a thermo-stated environment under a
12-hour light/dark cycle with free access to food and drinking
water.
Tumor challenge. For cancer cell inoculation, MCF-7 and MDA-
MB-231 cancer cells were grown until 70% confluent in growth
media. In the preincubation studies, the standard 10% FBS was
replaced by 10% human rest- or exercise-conditioned serum �
propranolol (10 mmol/L) from healthy women or breast cancer
patients for the last 48 hours prior to tumor inoculation. Five
million MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells were inoculated subcutane-
ously on the flank of the mice, and tumor growth was followed by
caliper measurements and allowed to reach a maximum volume of
1,000 mm3. Mice with MCF-7 tumors had their drinking water
supplemented with 10 mg/mL water-soluble b-Estradiol (Sigma).
Voluntary wheel running and catecholamine treatment. At the day
of tumor inoculations, mice were randomized to cages with/
without a running wheel of 12 cm in diameter [MCF-7: n ¼
14/10; MDA-MB-231: n ¼ 13/12 (control/exercise)], or to daily
injections of EPI (0.05 mg/mL, 200 mL i.p.; MCF-7: n ¼ 10; MDA-
MB-231: n ¼ 10) or NE (0.25 mg/mL, 200 mL i.p.; MCF-7: n ¼ 10;
MDA-MB-231: n ¼ 11). Mice were housed in pairs to prevent
isolation-induced stress; however, the running wheel allowed for
both mice to run simultaneously. Tumor volume was followed
using caliper readings and tumor volume was calculated by the
formula: tumor volume ¼ p � (longest diameter � diameter
perpendicular to aforementioned � depth)/6. At termination,
blood sugar was measured by Abbott Precision Xtra Glucose
monitoring system and blood was collected, separated into serum
by centrifugation, and stored at –80�C. Tumors were excised and
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Animals showing any sign
of illness during the intervention periods were euthanized and
excluded from the studies.
Molecular methods
Detailed methodologic description of PCR and Western blot-
ting analyses are presented in Supplementary Information.
Statistical analyses
Two-way ANOVA with subsequent Tukey posttest was used for
multiple comparison of exercise with additional interventions.
When the effects of interventions/stimulations were measured at
different time points or at different concentrations, a two-way
ANOVA with repeated measures was used, and for comparison of
2 groups, a two-tailed t test was used. Comparison of survival
curves in the murine preincubation study was performed by a Log-
rank (Mantel–Cox) test. Results are expressed as means � SEM

considered to be statistically significant. Data analyses were

Results
Effect of exercise-conditioned human serum on breast cancer
cell viability and tumorigenic potential
First, we stimulated the breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231, with serum obtained from 20 breast cancer
patients, participating in a 2-hour exercise session as part of
a clinical rehabilitation program. After 48 hours of incubation
with exercise-conditioned serum, breast cancer cell viability was
reduced with 11% in the MCF-7 cells (n ¼ 19, P < 0.05, Fig. 1A)
and 9% in MDA-MB-231 cells (n ¼ 20, P < 0.05, Fig. 1B) compared
with breast cancer cells incubated with serum obtained prior
to the exercise session. These data are in accordance with our
recent findings (12). In parallel, we performed a controlled
laboratory-based 2-hour moderate–intensity cycling intervention
at 55% of VO2peak in 7 healthy young women (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). As for the breast cancer patients, the viability of both
breast cancer cell lines were significantly reduced by the exercise-
conditioned serum (MCF-7; 1 hour: –10%, P < 0.01, 2 hours:
–19%, P < 0.001, Fig. 1C, MDA-MB-231; 1 hour: –14%. P < 0.05, 2
hours: –13%, P < 0.05, Fig. 1D).
To explore whether exercise-conditioned serum regulated the
tumorigenic potential of the cancer cells, we inoculated female
NMRI-Foxn1nu mice with 5 � 106 MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 breast
cancercells,whichhadbeenpreincubated for 48hourswithresting
or exercise-conditioned serum from the healthy women. Tumor
incidence and growth were then followed without any further
intervention. MCF-7 tumor incidence was markedly reduced for
the cells preincubated with exercise-conditioned serum, as only
45% of mice inoculated with cells preincubated with exercise-
conditioned serum formed tumors compared with 90% of the
mice inoculated the MCF-7 cells preincubated with serum
obtained at rest (P < 0.05, Fig. 1E). In continuation, end tumor
volume was significantly reduced in the group of mice with tumors
preincubated with exercise-conditioned serum (–76%, P <
0.05, Fig. 1F). Tumor incidence in mice inoculated with MDA-
MB-231 cells preincubated with exercise-conditioned serum,
tended to be lower than in mice inoculated with MDA-MB-231
cells preincubated with rest serum (P ¼ 0.09, Fig. 1G). Yet, no

 difference in end tumor volume was observed between the
two groups (Fig. 1H). These results demonstrate that exercise-
stimulated changes suppress breast cancer cell viability, but even
more strikingly reduce the tumorigenic potential of particular
MCF-7 cells.
Exercise-induced epinephrine and norepinephrine mediate the
cancer suppressive effect
We went on to explore which exercise factors were responsible
for the exercise-dependent suppression of the two breast cancer
cell lines. Noticeable candidates were the catecholamines, that is,
EPI and NE. These fight-or-flight hormones are markedly upre-
gulated during high-intensity exercise (15, 16), as also observed in
both human exercise intervention studies (Fig. 2A–D; ref. 12). In
addition, we found elevated levels of other known exercise-related
factors, that is, serum lactate was increased by 1.5-fold (P < 0.01,
Supplementary Fig. S1B), and IL6 by 2.4-fold (P < 0.05, Supple-
mentary Fig. S1C).
Next, we blocked b-adrenergic signaling by propranolol
during the serum incubation studies to explore whether catechol-
amine-dependent signaling were driving the exercise-mediated
suppression on cell viability and tumorigenic potential. Addition
of propranolol blunted the suppressive effect of the exercise-
conditioned serum on cell viability in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2E), while
there was no attenuating effect in the MDA-MB-231 cells (P <
0.01, Fig. 2F). In continuation, we inoculated mice with MCF-7
cells preincubated with exercise-conditioned serum and propran-
olol treatment, and found that b-adrenergic blockade during the
preincubation completely blunted exercise-mediated suppression
on tumor formation (Fig. 2G). These results highlight the role of
adrenergic signaling in the exercise-dependent control of breast
cancer tumorigenesis.
Regulation of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway by
epinephrine and norepinephrine
We proceeded to explore whether EPI and NE directly could
regulate breast cancer cell viability in cell culture studies. Both
cancer cell lines displayed visible decreases in viability by micros-
copy (Fig. 3A), and when quantified as percent cell confluence
after 48 hours of stimulation with EPI (MCF-7: –25%, P < 0.01;
MDA-MB-231: –18%, P < 0.01) or NE (MCF-7: –41%, P < 0.01;
MDA-MB-231: –6%, P < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B).

 In continuation, we demonstrated a dose-dependent growth-
inhibitory effect of both catecholamines for both breast cancer
cell lines at 24, 48, and 72 hours by MTT assays [10 mmol/L at 72
hours: MCF-7: EPI: –36% (P < 0.001), NE: –30% (P < 0.001);
MDA-MB-231: EPI: –32% (P < 0.001), NE: –48% (P < 0.001); Fig.
3B, Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2D].
EPI and NE have been shown to regulate the Hippo tumor
suppressor signaling pathway (17, 18).This developmental sig-
naling pathway is dysregulated in several types of cancer, includ-
ing breast cancer, where activation of the oncoproteins, YAP/TAZ,
are associated with tumor growth and progression, tumor forma-
tion, metastasis, and drug resistance (19). When the Hippo
pathway is induced, YAP and TAZ are phosphorylated and thus
inactivated. In line with the original studies, we found that EPI
and NE directly regulated the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway in
the two breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 3C–F; Supplementary
Fig. S3A–S3D). Both EPI and NE induced a rapid phosphorylation
of YAP Ser127 at 15 and 30 minutes (P < 0.05; Fig. 3C and D), and
a reduction in total TAZ protein at 30–120 minutes (P <
0.01; Fig. 3F) in MCF-7 cells. In continuation, expression levels
of genes downstream of YAP/TAZ were significantly downregu-
lated (Fig. 3G).
Exercise-conditioned serum is controlling breast cancer cells
through the Hippo signaling pathway
Next, we investigated whether the Hippo tumor suppressor
pathway was regulated by exercise-conditioned serum (Fig. 4).
Incubation with exercise-conditioned serum induced phos-
phorylation of YAP in MCF-7 cells in a time-dependent man-
ner, peaking already at 15 minutes, which was evident by YAP
phos-tag staining (Fig. 4A), as well as phosphorylation on
YAP Ser127 (P ¼ 0.05, n ¼ 3, Fig. 4B). In parallel, total protein
levels of YAP tended to decrease (P ¼ 0.09, Fig. 4C), while TAZ
protein remained unchanged (Fig. 4D). In MDA-MB-231 cells,
there were no significant differences in pYAP (P ¼ 0.13), YAP,
or TAZ protein expression after 1 hour of incubation with
exercise-conditioned serum (Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4D).
Phosphorylation of YAP leads to its cytosolic sequestration,
and
subsequent
proteolytic
breakdown.
Accordingly,
we
depicted the cellular localization of YAP after incubation with
exercise-conditioned serum, and found that YAP was indeed
sequestrated in the cytosol following serum incubation for
1 hour (Fig. 4E). Correspondingly, this deactivation and
cytosolic sequestration of YAP, resulted in decreased expres-
sion of YAP target genes in MCF-7 cells [MCF-7; ANKRD1:

0.05); Fig. 4F]. In the MDA-MB-231 cells, exercise-conditioned
serum had less effect on the expression levels of these genes
[MDA-MB-231; ANKRD1: –6% (P ¼ 0.06), CTGF: –4% (P <

stimulating MCF-7 cells with serum in combination with
propranolol, we found that b-adrenergic blockade reduced the
serum-mediated phosphorylation of YAP (Fig. 4A and Sup-
plementary Fig. S4F).
Voluntary wheel running regulates tumor growth in mice
To evaluate the effect of exercise on breast cancer tumor
growth in vivo, female NMRI-Foxn1nu mice were inoculated
with MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 tumor cells, and randomized to
home cages with or without running wheels. Mice with access
to running wheels ran voluntarily approximately 4 km per
night/cage (Supplementary Fig. S5A). For MCF-7 tumor-bear-
ing mice, all mice from the exercise group completed the study
while 4 mice from the control group were euthanized due to
signs of illness. For MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice, 2 mice
from the exercise group and 4 mice from the control group
did not complete the study. Growth of both MCF-7 (–36%, P <
0.05) and MDA-MB-231 (–66%, P < 0.01) tumors were reduced
by voluntary wheel running compared with control mice
(Fig. 5A and B). We have previously seen that propranolol
treatment can blunt the exercise-dependent suppression of
tumor growth in B16 melanoma-bearing wild-type mice
(20). Here, we also attempted to block b-adrenergic signaling
during the exercise intervention, but the NMRI-Foxn1nu mice
did not tolerate the propranolol treatment. In tumors from the
running mice, we found no difference in protein expression of
pYAP (Fig. 5C–D), which may simply reflect that these tumors
were excised at rest. We did however find an overall down-
regulation of downstream genes in the MCF-7 tumors from
mice with access to running wheels (P < 0.05, two-way
ANOVA, Fig. 5E), while the expression of these genes were not
affected in MDA-MB-231 tumors (Fig. 5F).
Exercise-dependent control of breast cancer progression has
been suggested to relate to weight control (21); however, in these
lean chow-fed mice, we did not observe any differences in body
weight or blood glucose between the control and wheel running
groups at the end of the study (Supplementary Fig. S5B), and
neither body weight nor blood glucose levels correlated with
tumor volume in the either of the two groups (Supplementary
Fig. S5C). Moreover, we have previously shown that wheel run-
ning controls growth of melanoma tumors through an exercise-
dependent mobilization of immune cells (20); however, in our
breast cancer models, wheel running only tended to increase
immune cell infiltration as reflected by the expression of immune
cell markers in MDA-MB-231 tumors (Fig. 5G and H). Thus, we
did not find evidence to suggest that neither weight control nor
immune cell infiltration were the primary exercise-induced
mechanisms responsible for suppression of tumor growth in
these models.

 Control of tumor growth in mice by daily injections of
epinephrine and norepinephrine
Finally, we investigated if EPI and NE had direct effects on
tumor growth in vivo, by inoculating MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cells in NMRI-Foxn1nu mice, and subsequently treated with
daily physiologic doses of EPI (0.05 mg/mL, 200 mL, i.p.) or NE
(0.25 mg/mL, 200 mL, i.p.), mimicking the increases occurring
during acute exercise. Concordant with the tumor suppression
observed with wheel running (Fig. 5A and B), we found that both
EPI and NE reduced tumor growth of MCF-7 tumors [EPI: –85%
(n ¼ 9, P < 0.001), NE: –53% (n ¼ 6, P < 0.05), Fig. 6A] and MDA-
MB-231 tumors [EPI: –59% (n ¼ 9, P < 0.01), NE: –58% (n ¼ 10, P
< 0.01), Fig. 6B]. As for the wheel running intervention, daily
injections of EPI or NE had no effect on body weight (Fig. 6C and
D), and end tumor volume did not correlate with body weight
(Fig. 6E and F).
Discussion
Despite a large number of published training intervention
studies in women with breast cancer, relative little is known about
the molecular mechanisms whereby exercise andexercise-induced
factors influence breast cancer biology and progression. The
current study is the first to demonstrate that systemic changes
occurring during exercise can reduce breast cancer cell viability
and decrease tumorigenesis through regulation of the Hippo
signaling pathway. This exercise-dependent control of breast
cancer was driven by induction of catecholamines, that is, EPI
and NE, both of which directly regulated the Hippo signaling
pathway, suppressed breast cancer cell viability and reduced
tumor formation in vivo. We have used two distinct breast cancer
cell lines, and while both cell lines were regulated by exercise and
catecholamine stimulation, the less aggressive hormone-sensitive
cell line, MCF-7, displayed greater sensitivity to exercise-mediated
activation of Hippo signaling.
Solid epidemiologic data show that regular exercise is associ-
ated with lower risk of developing breast cancer, as well as
decreased risk of disease recurrence (5, 8, 9). Recently, excitement
about the identification of exercise-dependent immune cell reg-
ulation and myokine secretion in cancer control have highlighted
the clinical potential of utilizing exercise in cancer therapy (22).
Yet, to fully explore the potential of exercise in control of breast
cancer, a detailed molecular understanding of the effect of exercise
and exercise factors in breast cancer biology is warranted. To this
end, we have recently shown that systemic changes occurring
during acute exercise can directly inhibit breast cancer cell viability
(12). In line with these results, we here demonstrate that serum
taken during or immediately after an exercise session from both
breast cancer patients and healthy women could reduce cancer cell
viability in vitro by approximately 10%. Yet, the effect of exercise-
conditioned serum on the tumorigenic potential was even more
strikingly. Here, preincubation with exercise-conditioned serum
reduced MCF-7 tumor formation with 50%.
Endurance exercise has been suggested to alter Hippo signaling
in skeletal muscles through AMPK-, EPI-, and IL6-driven regula-
tions of YAP (23); however, the effect of exercise on Hippo
signaling is undescribed in cancer. The Hippo tumor suppressor
signaling pathway is involved in basal processes like cellular
growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, and is particularly recog-
nized for its role in tissue development (24). In many cell types,
including myoblasts, cardiomyocytes, and several cancer cells YAP
hyperactivity increases cell proliferation (25–29). An even more
striking effect of activation of Hippo signaling and thus reduced
YAP activation is a pronounced suppression of tumor formation
(17, 30–32), corresponding precisely to the effect seen in our
studies with preincubation with exercise-conditioned serum. The

 Hippo signaling pathway has been shown to be dysregulated in
several types of cancer, including breast cancer, where the activa-
tion of the oncoproteins YAP/TAZ have been associated with a
poor prognosis (19), and the therapeutic role of YAP has been
studied in gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, where
molecules targeting YAP caused pronounced tumor regression in
mice (33, 34).
Activation of Hippo signaling comprises of phosphorylation
and thus inhibition of the two homologous transcription factors,
YAP and TAZ. This phosphorylation leads to sequestration of
YAP/TAZ in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing the induction of
their target genes, that is, genes involved in cell proliferation and
survival (35). The cytoplasmic sequestration also leads to ubiqui-
tin-mediated degradation of YAP/TAZ, further inhibiting their
function (36). Here, we demonstrate that exercise-conditioned
serum has the potential to regulate all of these steps, including a 2-
fold induction of YAP phosphorylation, retention of YAP to the
cytoplasmic compartment, a 50% reduction in the amount of
total YAP protein, and 17%–19 % decrease in the expression of
YAP target genes, in particular in MCF-7 cells. Although the
regulation at each step might not seem dramatic, the notion that
acutely induced exercise factors can elicit these responses is
highlighting that these physiologic changes may translate into
a pronounced effect on tumor formation.
The Hippo pathway is regulated by numerous extracellular
stimuli, among other factors signaling through G protein–
coupled receptors (17, 24). While most G-coupled receptor
ligands have shown to inhibit Hippo signaling, the catechola-
mines have shown to stimulate Hippo signaling through b-adren-
ergic receptors, resulting in inactivation of YAP/TAZ (24, 37). In
line with this, we found that the exercise-dependent breast cancer
suppression could be mimicked by EPI or NE. Both of these factors
were markedly upregulated in our acute human exercise inter-
ventions, and blockade of their signaling through b-adrenergic
receptors during the serum incubation studies, blunted the exer-
cise-mediated growth suppression in the MCF-7 cells, as well as
tumor formation. Moreover, direct stimulation of the breast
cancer cell lines with either EPI or NE activated Hippo signaling,
reduced breast cancer cell viability, and suppressed tumor growth
when EPI and NE were injected daily in tumor-bearing mice. This
control of breast cancer tumor growth by b-adrenergic stimulation
is in accordance with studies from other groups (38, 39). We have
recently shown that EPI could mimic the exercise-mediated con-
trol of melanoma tumor growth through mobilization and acti-
vation of NK cells, resulting in increased intratumoral immune
cell infiltration (20). In the breast cancer tumors in the current
study, we also evaluated the effect of wheel running on immune
cell infiltration, and although wheel running tended to increase

 the infiltration of some immune cell subsets, it could not explain
the pronounced effect on tumor growth control.
Throughout this study, we have utilized MCF-7 and MDA-MB-
231 breast cancer cell lines. These comprise markedly different
phenotypic characteristics, that is, MCF-7 cells are sex hormone
sensitive with a luminal A classification, representing the majority
of breast cancer tumors in patients. In contrast, the MDA-MB-231
cells are triple negative with claudin-low classification, represent-
ing another subgroup of breast cancer tumors, typically with a
worse prognosis (13). Despite these marked differences in the
molecular profiles, the progression of both breast cancer cell lines
was affected by wheel running, exercise-conditioned serum, as
well as both catecholamines. However, the two cell lines dis-
played differential responses regarding regulation of the Hippo
signaling pathway. The MCF-7 cells showed a rapid phosphory-
lation of YAP with both exercise-conditioned serum and EPI and
NE, sequestration to the cytosol and suppression of downstream
genes. In our hands, MDA-MB-231 cells showed a less pro-
nounced induction in YAP phosphorylation by EPI and NE, while
exercise-conditioned serum only regulated Hippo signaling to a
minor degree. Yet, Yu and colleagues have comprehensively
shown that EPI can phosphorylate and deactivate YAP in MDA-
MB-231 cells in time- and dose-dependent manners (24). One
marked difference between the two cell lines is the b-adrenergic
receptor density, which is much higher in MDA-MB-231 cells
compared with MCF-7 cells (40). Furthermore, as many signaling
pathways converge at YAP, additional exercise-stimulated signal-
ing pathways may cross-communicate to explain the differential
response. Chen and colleagues have shown that LIF, a member
of the IL6 superfamily, is an upstream tumor suppressor,
which inhibited breast cancer metastasis through Hippo and YAP
signaling (31). LIF is also recognized as an exercise-induced
muscle-derived factor, that is, myokine (41), and in line with
this, we have previously shown that such myokines can inhibit the
proliferation of breast cancer cells (42). A recent study has also
demonstrated that Hippo signaling interacts with ERa signaling,
and loss of Hippo signaling conferred resistance to antihormonal
therapy (43).
It is important to distinguish between the acute and rapid
exercise/stress response, demonstrated to suppress breast cancer
cell viability in this study, and chronically upregulated stress
responses. During exercise, systemic levels of catecholamines
increase several fold, but these levels return rapidly to baseline
levels after exercise cessation, with the half-life of EPI being within
minutes. In contrast, chronic stress is associated with persistent
elevations of catecholamine levels, as well as other stress factors,
for example, cortisol (44). In this situation, several studies have
documented that the chronic upregulation of stress factors,
including the catecholamines is associated with increased tumor
progression (45).
Taken together, we show an omnipresent exercise-dependent
suppression of breast cancer cell viability and tumorigenic poten-
tial that depends on acutely exercise-induced catecholamines and
suggest a role for regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway. The
identification of EPI and NE as active oncostatic factors in the
exercise-mediated control of breast cancer cell viability and tumor
formation suggests that exercise of moderate to high intensity is
the most optimal regimen for generation of an acute systemic
response with potential to directly control breast cancer cell
development.
