Abstract
Introduction
Ticks are the most common arthropod vectors of both human and animal diseases in Europe,
and the Ixodes ricinus tick species is able to transmit a large number of bacteria, viruses and
parasites. Ticks may also be co-infected with several pathogens, with a subsequent high like-
lihood of co-transmission to humans or animals. However few data exist regarding co-infec-
tion prevalences, and these studies only focus on certain well-known pathogens. In addition
to pathogens, ticks also carry symbionts that may play important roles in tick biology, and
could interfere with pathogen maintenance and transmission. In this study we evaluated the
prevalence of 38 pathogens and four symbionts and their co-infection levels as well as possi-
ble interactions between pathogens, or between pathogens and symbionts.
Methodology/principal findings
A total of 267 Ixodes ricinus female specimens were collected in the French Ardennes and
analyzed by high-throughput real-time PCR for the presence of 37 pathogens (bacteria and
parasites), by rRT-PCR to detect the presence of Tick-Borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and
by nested PCR to detect four symbionts. Possible multipartite interactions between patho-
gens, or between pathogens and symbionts were statistically evaluated. Among the infected
ticks, 45% were co-infected, and carried up to five different pathogens. When adding symbi-
ont prevalences, all ticks were infected by at least one microorganism, and up to eight micro-
organisms were identified in the same tick. When considering possible interactions between
pathogens, the results suggested a strong association between Borrelia garinii and B. afzelii,
whereas there were no significant interactions between symbionts and pathogens.
Conclusion/significance
Our study reveals high pathogen co-infection rates in ticks, raising questions about possible
co-transmission of these agents to humans or animals, and their consequences to human

with pathogens, opening new avenues of enquiry regarding their effects on pathogen trans-
mission and vector competence.
Author Summary
Ticks transmit more pathogens than any other arthropod, and one single species can
transmit a large variety of bacteria and parasites. Because co-infection might be much
more common than previously thought, we evaluated the prevalence of 38 known or
neglected tick-borne pathogens in Ixodes ricinus ticks. Our results demonstrated that co-
infection occurred in almost half of the infected ticks, and that ticks could be infected with
up to five pathogens. Moreover, as it is well established that symbionts can affect pathogen
transmission in arthropods, we also evaluated the prevalence of four symbiont species and
demonstrated that all ticks were infected by at least one microorganism. This work high-
lights the co-infection phenomenon in ticks, which may have important implications for
human and animal health, emphasizing the need for new diagnostic tests better adapted to
tick-borne diseases. Finally, the high co-occurrence of symbionts and pathogens in ticks,
reveals the necessity to also account for these interactions in the development of new alter-
native strategies to control ticks and tick-borne disease.
Introduction
Ticks are the most common arthropod vectors of disease agents to humans and domestic ani-
mals in Europe [1]. Ixodes ricinus is the most important tick in terms of human and animal
health as it can attach to vertebrate hosts for up to ten days, and takes a blood meal during each
of its three life stages of larva, nymph and adult, except adult males who mate with feeding
adult females. The natural hosts of I. ricinus include almost all wild or domestic animals living
in woods and pasture, whereas humans become accidental hosts when entering tick habitats.
Of all ticks, I. ricinus transmits the greatest variety of pathogens i.e., microorganisms able to
cause disease in animals or humans [2]. This is likely due to the large variety of animals from
which they can ingest blood, exposing the ticks to any pathogens currently infecting the hosts,
including bacteria (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato group: Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, B.
garinii, B. afzelii, B. spielmanii [3], Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the spotted fever group of
Rickettsia sp., and possibly Bartonella spp. and Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis. . .), para-
sites (mainly Babesia), and viruses (mainly tick-borne encephalitis virus). Questing larvae can
only be infected by those few pathogens capable of horizontal transmission in ticks. Thus larvae
have a limited potential role as vectors of human or animal pathogens. In contrast, the impor-
tance of nymphs on the impact of tick-borne pathogens on public health is readily recognized.
Indeed, questing nymphs have already been exposed to pathogens during their blood meal as
larvae. They are often able to transmit pathogens, especially considering nymph bites often go
unnoticed due to their tiny size, and that transmission rates increase with lengthening meal
duration [4]. Questing adults can also bite humans, and are the cause of between 10 to 40% of
all human tick bites in Europe [5–8]. During the larval and nymphal stages they have ingested
two blood meals, both potential pathogen-acquiring occasions. Thus, they are more likely to be
infected and co-infected than nymphs [7,9,10] and represent a substantial threat to the public
health, especially in term of co-infections. However, they are less numerous in the environment
[11] and they are often removed earlier than nymphs because they are more easily detected.

Competing Interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist.
 Ticks co-infection [12–18], and co-transmission of pathogens [19–28] might have impor-
tant potential implications and hence be highly relevant to public health [29]. Indeed co-infec-
tion in humans and animals might enhance disease severity as has been reported for
concurrent babesiosis and Lyme disease [30,31], and may also have significant consequences in
terms of tick-borne disease treatment and diagnosis [29].
In addition to human and animal pathogens, ticks also carry symbionts (any interacting
species [32]) that may not only play a role in tick biology, but might also interact with patho-
gens [33]. Occasionally, the distinction between pathogens and endosymbionts is blurred. For
instance, some authors state that Rickettsia species are primarily endosymbionts that are verti-
cally transmitted by arthropods, and only exist secondarily as vertebrate pathogens [34]. Sec-
ondly, Coxiella burnetii is mostly reported as a vertebrate pathogen, even though numerous
other Coxiella species have been identified in ticks. In fact, it was recently demonstrated that
the inherited tick symbiont C. burnetii has emerged and is now able to infect vertebrates [35].
Thirdly, Wolbachia is a common symbiont widespread in insects affecting the reproduction
and/or immunity of their hosts [36] [37]. This species has also been found associated with ticks
[38]. A recent experimental approach has revealed that the presence of Wolbachia in I. ricinus
was due to parasitism from the parasitoid wasp, Ixodiphagus hookeri [39]. And finally, the I.
ricinus endosymbiont Midichloria mitochondrii is detected in nearly all I. ricinus females
derived from natural populations [40]. The high prevalence and transovarial transmission of
this symbiont suggest that an obligate association exists, playing a crucial role in tick fitness.
However, in laboratory-raised I. ricinus colonies, its prevalence decreased, indicating that any
advantage acquired by the tick may only be evident under natural conditions [41]. M. mito-
chondrii has also recently been reconsidered as a potential vertebrate pathogen [42].
Besides their likely important roles in tick biology, tick symbionts may also interfere with
pathogen transmission. For instance, endosymbionts belonging to the rickettsial genera are
thought to alter transmission of other rickettsial pathogens, as seen by the inverse relationship
between the infection prevalence of R. rickettsii (pathogen) and R. peacockii (symbiont) in Der-
mancentor andersoni [38,43]. Furthermore, the presence of Coxiella-related symbionts in the
salivary glands of Amblyomma ticks impairs transmission of Ehrlichia chaffeensis [44]. In addi-
tion to symbionts, ticks are also colonized with naturally-occurring bacterial microbiota,
mainly belonging to the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroides phyla [45,46]. Tick micro-
biomes can also interfere with pathogens. As an example, ticks bred in a sterile environment
exist without a normal microbiota, this alters their gut integrity and modifies B. burgdorferi’s
ability to colonize this niche [45]. Microbiome alterations may also result in modulated
immune responses, which might then interfere with pathogen survival and infection, as dem-
onstrated for other arthropod vectors [47].
Until now, most studies addressing tick co-infection have only been able to assess limited
numbers of pathogens at a time, such that they are unable to generate a clear and an accurate
representation of all pathogens present in ticks. To overcome this limitation, we have devel-
oped a novel high-throughput method to identify both major and neglected European tick-
borne pathogens (bacteria and parasites), representing up to 37 different species of bacteria
and parasites, in a single sample [48]. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of these 37 dif-
ferent known and neglected bacterial and parasitic tick-borne pathogens, and together with
TBEV, determined the co-infection level, and any possible interactions between the detected
pathogens in adult females. Females were analyzed as they have had an additional blood meal
compared to nymphs, and thus are more likely to be infected and co-infected thereby increas-
ing chances of identifying co-infections and potential interactions. As symbionts might have
significant effects on both pathogens (replication, survival, etc.) and ticks, we also determined
the presence of four suspected or known bacterial tick symbionts in parallel. i.e., Wolbachia sp.,

 Midichloria mitochondrii, Spiroplasma spp. and Acinetobacter spp. (as common gut inhabi-
tants of many arthropod species), and assessed possible multipartite interactions.
Materials and Methods
Ticks
From May to August 2012, 267 questing Ixodes ricinus female ticks were collected by flagging
along a transect line of approximately 80 km in the French Ardennes, a region endemic for
rodent-borne hantaviruses, during the course of a Puumala hantavirus epidemiological study
(Fig 1, [49]). Along this transect, we sampled six forested sites and three sites with fragmented
habitats (i.e. hedge networks). All collected ticks were surface sterilized and individually
crushed as previously described [50].
RNA and genomic DNA extraction
Genomic tick DNA was extracted from 100 μL of crushed tick using the Wizard genomic DNA
purification kit (Promega, France) according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was extracted

 from 100 μL of crushed tick using the Nucleospin RNA II kit (Macherey Nagel, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified DNA and RNA were eluted into 50 μL of
either elution buffer or RNase-free water respectively. Tick DNA/RNA quality was assessed via
amplification of the I. ricinus ITS2 and 16S rRNA fragments respectively as described [48,51].
High-throughput screening of bacterial and parasitic tick-borne
pathogens
The BioMark real-time PCR system (Fluidigm, USA) was used for high-throughput microflui-
dic real-time PCR for the most common bacterial and parasitic species of tick-borne pathogens
known to circulate in Europe, or that might emerge in Europe. Among them, we were able to
detect seven species belonging to the Lyme disease spirochete group (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu
lato): B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. spielmanii, B. valaisiana, B. lusitaniae,
and B. bissettii. We were also able to detect one species belonging to the Borrelia recurrent
fever group recently detected in France: B. miyamotoi. In addition to Borrelia species, we were
able to detect DNA from five species of Anaplasma (i.e. A. phagocytophilum, A. platys, A. mar-
ginale, A. ovis, A. centrale), Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Ehrlichia ruminantium, E.
canis, E. chaffeensis. We were also able to detect all Rickettsial species from the spotted fever
group using specific primers and probes, R. conorii, R. slovaca, R. massiliae, R. helvetica.
Among Bartonella species, we were able to detect B. henselae, as well as ten species of Babesia
(B. divergens, B. microti, B. caballi, B. canis, B. vogeli, B. venatorum, B. bovis, B. bigemina, B.
major, B. ovis). Finally, we were able to detect two species of Theileria parasite: T. equi and T.
annulata.
Briefly, a DNA pre-amplification step was performed in a final volume of 5 μL containing
2.5 μL TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix (2X), 1.2 μL of the pooled primer mix (0.2X) and 1.3 μL
of tick DNA, with one cycle at 95°C for 10 min, 14 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 4 min at 60°C.
Following pre-amplification, qPCRs were performed using FAM- and black hole quencher
(BHQ1)-labeled TaqMan probes [48] with TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix in accor-
dance with manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems, France). Thermal cycling condi-
tions were as follows: 95°C for 5 min, 45 cycles at 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 40°C for 10
s. Data were acquired on the BioMark Real-Time PCR system and analyzed using the Fluidigm
Real-Time PCR Analysis software to obtain crossing point (CP) values. Assays were performed
in duplicate and two negative water controls were included per chip.
Reverse transcription real-time PCR for TBEV
RNA samples were screened for TBEV by rRT-PCR targeting a 3’ non-coding region of the
TBEV genome using specific primers and probes [51]. rRT-PCR Taqman assays were per-
formed in a final volume of 20 μL using the LightCycler 480 RNA Master Hydrolysis Probes
Master Mix (Roche Applied Science, Germany) at 1 X final concentration, with 0.5 μM specific
primers and 0.25 μM probes, 3.25 mM manganese acetate [Mn(OAc)2] and 2 μL RNA. Positive
and negative (water) controls were included in each run. rRT-PCR thermal cycling conditions
were as follows: 63°C for 3 min, 95°C for 30 s, 45 cycles at 95°C for 10 s then 60°C for 30 s, fol-
lowed by cooling at 40°C for 10 s.
Validation of B. henselae prevalence by conventional PCR and
sequencing
Conventional PCR using primers targeting the Bartonella spp. gltA gene were used to confirm
the presence of B. henselae DNA in tick samples. Amplicons were sequenced by Eurofins

 MWG Operon (Germany), and then assembled using BioEdit software (Ibis Biosciences, Carls-
bad). An online Blast (National Center for Biotechnology Information) was used to compare
results with published sequences listed in GenBank.
Diagnostic PCR of bacterial symbionts
PCR amplification of bacterial 16S rRNA-encoding rrs genes was performed using 2 μL of tick
DNA template in 25 μL of reaction mixture containing 5X buffer (New England Biolabs), 40 μM
of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 0.2 μM of each pA and pH primer (primer details in
Table 1), 0.7 U of Q5 High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), 1X Q5 high GC
enhancer (New England Biolabs) and BSA (0.2 mg mL-1). Nested PCR was then used to screen
for the presence of Wolbachia, Spiroplasma, Acinetobacter, and Midichloria DNA in 2 μL positive
rrs PCR products. Reactions (25 μL) containing 1X polymerase reaction buffer (Invitrogen,
France), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 40 μM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 0.2 μM of each primer
pair (Table 1) and 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) were carried out in a T-Gradient
Thermocycler (Biometra, France). Each bacterial genus was amplified as previously described
[52–55]. For each set of PCR reactions, bacterial DNA extracts from reference strains were used
as positive controls. Amplified DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis through 1%
agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under ultraviolet illumination.
Detection of associations between pathogens and symbionts in ticks
The statistical likelihood of all possible combinations of pathogens and/or symbionts detectable
in this study was analyzed via an association screening approach as described previously [56].
Briefly, the association screening approach comprises a statistical test based on a simulated the-
oretical distribution of a statistic and its associated confidence interval, under the null hypothe-
sis H0, that pathogen associations are random. The occurrence (i.e. counts) for all possible
combinations was theoretically simulated for each pathogen combination, and each combina-
tion was unique. The ‘envelope’ function from the ‘boot’ package in R software was used to esti-
mate the 95% confidence envelope for the combination count distribution profile,
simultaneously including all infection patterns. A global test based on the 95% confidence
envelope was initially performed. When H0 was rejected, tests based on the number of possible
pathogen combination confidence intervals were performed. Because of the large number of
bacterial species that result in an excessive number of combinations compared to the number
of ticks, we split the association analyses into three parts: (i) the first concerned associations
between the Borrelia burgdorferi sl group (comprising B. burgdorferi s.s., B. garinii, B. afzelii, B.

mikurensis, R. helvetica, B. henselae and B. divergens); (ii) the second related to associations
among the Borrelia sp. group of the six Borrelia species; (iii) and the third analyzed symbiont
and pathogen associations, for which we analyzed possible interactions between all pathogens
(the Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. group analyzed as a whole) and each of the different symbionts.
Environmental drivers of infection
We investigated the effects of environmentally-linked variables (habitat and locality) on the
local prevalence of microorganisms (either pathogens or symbionts) within tick populations.
Statistical logistic regressions were performed with the R statistical platform using the package
MuMIn v.1.7.2 and lme4, with prevalence as the dependent variable, and habitat (forest vs.
hedges), and sampling site (nested within habitat) as fixed variables. Model selection was per-
formed using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) [57]. The model with the lowest AIC value
was viewed as the most parsimonious, i.e. the model which explains the majority of variance
with the fewest parameters [57].
Results
Pathogen prevalence according to habitat
In this study, we analyzed I. ricinus for the presence of bacterial or parasitic DNA, including
the most common tick-borne pathogens circulating in Europe (Fig 2), as well as TBEV RNA.
Among the 267 individually analyzed female ticks, almost half (45%) were infected by at least
one pathogen. Of these, the most prevalent nucleic acids belonging to pathogenic agent were
those affiliating to Lyme disease spirochetes [21.7% in total; including B. burgdorferi sensu
stricto (5.6%), B. afzelii (9.4%), B. garinii (10.8%), B. valaisiana (6.0%), and B. spielmanii

 (2.2%)]. The next most prevalent nucleic acids corresponded to Bartonella henselae (17.6%)
and Rickettsia of the spotted fever group (16.8%), which were mostly Rickettsia helvetica. Due
to the unexpectedly high prevalence of B. henselae, all ticks that returned positive qPCR results
were also tested by conventional PCR for the Bartonella gltA gene. All samples gave positive
PCR amplicons, which after sequencing demonstrated that all samples shared 100% identity
with B. henselae (Houston I strain), confirming that 17.6% of ticks carried B. henselae DNA.
Besides these highly prevalent pathogens, other pathogens with lower prevalences were also
detected: Borrelia miyamotoi (3.0%), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (2.6%), Candidatus Neoehr-
lichia mikurensis (1.4%), and Babesia divergens (0.37%). We failed to detect TBEV, other Borre-
lia species (B. lusitaniae and B. bissettii), other Babesia species (B. microti, B. caballi, B. canis, B.
vogeli, B. venatorum, B. bovis, B. bigemina, B. major and B. ovis), Theileria species (T. equi, T.
annulata), other Rickettsia species (R. conorii, R. slovaka, R. massiliae), Ehrlichia species (E.
ruminantium, E. canis, E. chaffeensis), and other Anaplasma species (A. phagocytophilum, A.
platys, A. marginale, A. ovis, A. centrale).
Statistical models indicated significant variation in the prevalence of B. burgdorferi sensu
lato, B. henselae, and R. helvetica amongst sampling sites (Table 2). For the other microorgan-
isms, none of the variables were retained in the most parsimonious model, thus suggesting that
their prevalence was not clearly related to locality or the type of habitat.
Co-infections and associations between pathogens
Among all infected ticks (120/267, 45% of all collected ticks) half were found to be co-infected
(54 co-infected ticks out of 120 infected ticks) (Fig 3A): 9% carried DNA from two pathogen
species, 6.7% carried DNA from three pathogens, 1.9% carried DNA from four pathogens, and
0.75% carried DNA from five different pathogens. When performing statistical analyses of bac-
terial associations, where only the five Borrelia species were included, five combinations were

 significant (p-values: <10−3): two co-infection patterns were found to be significantly over-rep-
resented, one between Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, B. afzelii, and B. spielmanii,
and the other between Borrelia garinii and B. afzelii; while three combinations were signifi-
cantly under-represented, these included two single infections (Borrelia garinii and B. afzelii),
and combinations concerning non-infected individuals. When analyzing all pathogens
together, and when the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato group was analyzed as a single pathogen,
no combinations were found to be significant (Table 3).
Interactions between symbionts and pathogens
We were able to estimate the prevalence of four known or suspected symbionts associated with
ticks, i.e., Wolbachia, Spiroplasma, Acinetobacter, and Midichloria mitochondrii. Tick samples
were only utilized in prevalence analysis if the rrs gene could be successfully amplified prior to
specific amplification. From a total of 255 analyzed tick specimens, M. mitochondrii DNA was
detected in all ticks (100% prevalent), Spiroplasma spp. DNA was found in 75.7% of ticks, Acine-
tobacter spp. in 64.7% of ticks, and Wolbachia DNA in 19.2% of ticks (Fig 2). Analysis of the 823
bp PCR products identified several different Wolbachia wsp genes which aligned with KT285474,
KT285475, KT285476, KT285477, and KT285478 sequences. PCR products shared 99% identity

 with Wolbachia wsp sequences previously reported as associated with insects and parasitoid
Hymenoptera: the parasitoid Nasonia vitripennis (M84686.1), the parasitoid Pteromalus
puparum (EU827689.1), the birch catkin bug Kleidocerys resedea (JQ726770.1) [22], the pigeon
fly Pseudolynchia canarienis (GQ167624.1), and Colpodes buchanani (GU236928.1). Accord-
ingly, due to these high rates of infection, the overall co-infection rate also increased when symbi-
onts were added to the pathogen analyses; since all ticks were found to be infected by at least one
microorganism, and some ticks were carrying up to eight microorganisms each (Fig 3B).
Statistical models indicated significant variation in the prevalence of Wolbachia sp., Spiro-
plasma sp., and Acinebacter sp. amongst sampling sites (Table 2). When assessing possible
interactions between symbionts and pathogens, no combinations were found to be significant.
Discussion
Using powerful high-throughput epidemiological tools we achieved a comprehensive overview
of the epidemiological situation of tick-borne pathogens circulating in ticks from the French
Ardennes. The most significant findings were; 1) the high overall levels of pathogen infection,
since half of all ticks (120 out of 267) carried at least one pathogen and 2) frequency of co-infec-
tion, as half of the infected ticks (54 out of 120) were infected by at least two pathogens. Both
novel results may have important implications in terms of public health issues [19–25,29].
First of all, co-infections with different tick-borne pathogens in both humans and animals
are commonly reported [20,22–25,58,59]. For instance, in the USA it was shown that 11% of
Lyme disease patients in southern New England also experienced concurrent babesiosis [59],
and 13% of Lyme disease patients in Wisconsin also contracted human granulocytic anaplas-
mosis [60]. Of 310 North American patients suspected to be infected with tick-borne disease
and screened for Lyme disease, HGA, and Babesiosis, 117 had single infections, 75 had co-
infections, and 4 individuals were positive for Lyme disease, HGA, and Babesiosis [58].
Tick-borne co-infections can have enormous impact on the diagnostic methods utilized.
For instance, the diagnosis of tick-borne disease in France is almost uniquely limited to Lyme
Borreliosis. The detection of many different pathogenic species in ticks indicates that diagnos-
tic tools must match the range of pathogens carried by ticks from every specific geographical
area. Another important public health issue is that co-infections may enhance disease severity,
or alter typical symptoms, thus impeding diagnosis [59]. For instance, co-infected Lyme disease
patients harbored more influenza-like symptoms than those with Lyme disease alone [59]. In
the case of concurrent babesiosis and Lyme disease, co-infected patients experienced a greater
number of symptoms for a longer duration than those with Lyme disease alone [59]. And
finally, co-infections can affect tick-borne disease treatment, as antibiotic therapies prescribed
for Lyme disease are not efficient against parasitic or viral diseases.
In this context, adopting a perspective that takes co-infection into account may help to iden-
tify more causes of tick-borne disease, and thus aid in the development of adapted diagnostic
tools and treatments [29].
Despite the importance of nymphs in terms of pathogen transmission, we chose to investi-
gate co-infection in adult ticks for two main reasons: firstly, because they feed once more than
nymphs and are more likely to be (co)-infected; secondly, even though nymphs are thought to
be more relevant to public health (bites may remain undetected due to their small size), adults
may actually be more important than previously thought. Contrary to popular belief, female
adult ticks are capable of biting humans (although probably in lower proportions than
nymphs) [5–8], and although female ticks are likely more easily noticed and removed before
the end of their blood meal due to their larger size, perhaps reducing pathogen transmission
time [4], transmission might start before the tick bite is noticed and adult tick removal.

 Combined with the fact that adults are more likely to be co-infected, and that co-infections in
humans are difficult to diagnose, studying adult tick co-infection appears highly relevant. In
any case, similar future studies should be performed on nymphs to assess co-infection levels in
this highly relevant tick stage.
The most prevalent tick pathogens were those linked to Lyme disease, which is not entirely
surprising due to the region’s close proximity to Alsace, the most important French territory
endemic for Lyme disease. Of the five French Borrelia species responsible for Lyme disease, B.
garinii and B. afzelii were the most prevalent in ticks, with Lyme borreliosis spirochete species
detected in 21.7% of ticks. This infection rate reflects previously published results, with preva-
lences ranging from 6% in Western France, to 32% in forests around Paris [61], and 36% in
Alsace [62]. In addition to Lyme Borreliosis spirochetes, we also identified Borrelia miyamotoi
in 3% of ticks. Similar to Lyme borreliosis etiological agents, this pathogenic species is trans-
mitted by the same Ixodes tick species, but causes different clinical manifestations (relapsing
fever, without erythema migrans). Up until now no human cases have been reported in France,
but our data and the recent case of human infection described in the Netherlands [63] suggest
that surveillance urgently needs to be improved.
Interestingly, the most prevalent pathogens after Lyme spirochetes were B. henselae (17.6%)
and R. helvetica (16.8%). Over recent years many reports have identified B. henselae DNA in
ticks and in patients bitten by ticks [64,65], and I. ricinus has also been identified as a compe-
tent vector for B. henselae [66]. Notwithstanding these findings, the role of ticks as a vector of
B. henselae is still heartily debated, where the faction “against” argues that if transmission has
occurred, it may only be anecdotal. Prevalence of B. henselae DNA in ticks varies greatly
between countries, with no positive detection in the Netherlands, to a confirmed significant
prevalence in ticks from Germany [64]. Variation may also occur at a national level. For exam-
ple, B. henselae prevalence in ticks from France varied from 1% in ticks collected near Paris
[48] to 38% in some specific regions of Alsace [64]. These significant differences could be
explained by the differential presence of B. henselae reservoirs in the studied areas. For B. hen-
selae, the most common reservoir animals are Felidae, including wild cats [67,68]. Interestingly,
wild felids were known to be present in the Ardennes forest from which ticks were collected,
and thus may serve as the actual reservoir for this bacterium. In addition to felids, it has been
frequently debated whether rodents could also play a role as a possible B. henselae reservoir.
One study isolated B. henselae from Apodemus sylvaticus wood mice, which also happens to be
a common Ixodes larval host [69]. In addition to tick survey, we have also conducted the identi-
fication of Bartonella species in small mammals collected in France (in a forest located in
Southeastern Paris) but did not detect any B. henselae despite high prevalence of other Barto-
nella species confirming that rodents are unlikely to be infected by B. henselae [70].
R. helvetica has previously been described as prevalent in ticks throughout Europe, and this
finding was replicated in our study [71,72]. It is still unknown whether an animal reservoir
exists for this bacterium, and thus the tick is thought to be the natural reservoir. Its pathogenic-
ity in humans also remains unclear. For instance, R. helvetica has been incriminated in the
development of fatal perimyocarditis, however isolation of the bacterium from a patient is still
required to definitively confirm its pathogenic status as a cause of perimyocarditis [73].
Following these highly prevalent pathogens, we detected much lower prevalence levels for
A. phagocytophilum and the possible tick-borne pathogen Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikuren-
sis. Both are known to be pathogenic for humans and/or animals. However clinical symptoms
caused by these agents are not pathognomonic, and could be indicative of other pathogens.
Because public health professionals may be unaware of these types of diseases, multiple unre-
ported cases may exist. Monitoring of these bacteria must be enhanced to the level of other
tick-borne pathogens.

 Interestingly, we detected Babesia species (B. divergens) at very low prevalence rates (0.3%),
which might be explained by the absence of its natural bovine host in the collected area.
In this study, all of these pathogens were found to co-exist within individual ticks (up to five
species of pathogens in the same tick). When considering possible interactions between patho-
gens, the association results are suggestive of a strong association between Borrelia garinii and
Borrelia afzelii in ticks. Borrelia garinii or Borrelia afzelii are implicated in four of the five sig-
nificant combinations: they are detected together more frequently than for any other two com-
binations (Table 3), as a result, they are less frequently detected alone. B. garinii and B. afzelii
are known to have different reservoir hosts ([74,75], birds and rodents respectively). Female
ticks can contract infection at both the larval and nymph stages. Thus, the detected association
between B. garinii and B. afzelii could result from: (i) immature stages having fed on both birds
and rodents (ii) ticks contracting Borrelia species other than the Borrelia which infects their
host during co-feeding, (iii) and/or biological interactions between the two Borrelia species
that facilitate co-infection. Furthermore, our findings suggest a possible role for the combina-
tion of Borrelia garinii and B. afzelii together, which favors the establishment of bacteremia by
Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. and Borrelia spielmanii. In addition, given the observed prevalence of
the five Borrelia species, a surprising number of ticks were actually free from Borrelia, likely
caused by the under-representation of infections with only B. garinii or B. afzelii.
High prevalence rates may indicate intimate symbiotic relationships between a given bacte-
rium and its host. For at least three species, M. mitochondrii (100%), Spiroplasma (75.7%), and
Acinetobacter (64.7%), such high prevalences were actually observed, thus conferring probable
symbiont status to these I. ricinus bacteria. Previous studies have demonstrated M. mitochon-
drii presence in 100% of I. ricinus females within a geographical locality [40,41]. Interestingly,
it was demonstrated that M. mitochondrii can reside in tick salivary glands [76]. These authors
suggested that M. mitochondrii could modulate the host’s immune response via I. ricinus saliva,
which is important for both the success of the tick blood meal and for initiating infection by
tick-vectored pathogens. Despite the importance of I. ricinus to both human and veterinary
medicine, the full consequences of M. mitochondrii presence on the biology of its host arthro-
pod remain unknown.
The genus Spiroplasma encompasses diverse poorly characterized species, including com-
mensal, mutualistic, and pathogenic organisms [77,78]. While many categories of insects and
arachnids harbor these bacteria, little information is available on the prevalence and distribu-
tion of Spiroplasma in natural tick populations. A recent study showed that Spiroplasma and
Coxiella dominated bacterial microbiota in tick salivary glands, accounting for more than 90%
of the bacterial community in Ixodes ovatus [79]. These results are in accordance with our find-
ings and again suggest a symbiotic association between this bacterium and ticks.
To our knowledge, this is the first study estimating Acinetobacter prevalence in ticks. The
relatively high prevalence described here (64.7%), poses further questions as to how I. ricinus
females acquire and transmit the bacterium. Acinetobacter are often found associated with
hematophagous arthropods [55,80] and its role in insect biology has only been demonstrated
in the fly Stomoxys calcitrans, which requires these bacteria to ensure complete larval develop-
ment [81].
Surprisingly, we found an overall Wolbachia infection frequency of 19.2% in female I. rici-
nus. This indeed contrasts with previous infection prevalence values of 1.0% in French adult I.
ricinus ticks [61], or with other European prevalence studies, where 0.9% of adult I. ricinus
ticks were infected in Southern Germany [82], and where it was not detected in ticks from the
west coast of Norway [83]. It was recently demonstrated that Wolbachia in ticks is actually due
to the seemingly cryptic interaction of the I. hookeri wasp [39]. This hymenopteran endopara-
sitoid mostly parasites nymphs, and whose existence only becomes visible after tick

 engorgement. The adult tick’s innate immune response against parasitoid eggs likely explains
the lower Wolbachia infection rate in adult ticks [39]. More efforts are needed to fully under-
stand the apparently contradictory higher infection prevalence found in this study.
Overall, statistical association analysis between symbionts and pathogens did not reveal any
significant associations. This might indicate that the presence of symbionts does not affect the
presence of pathogens. However, even though no synergistic or antagonistic associations were
observed, this does not exclude the possibility of more subtle functional interactions between
commensal microbiota with potential impact on pathogen acquisition, transmission, and viru-
lence that are not currently revealed by our statistical tests and the limited number of ticks ana-
lyzed. Another limitation of our study is the use of adult stage only. Indeed, nymphs are also a
very important stage in terms of public health and a better knowledge of the importance of co-
infection as well as the possible interaction between pathogens and symbionts in nymphs will
be of great interest.
In conclusion, our study reveals high pathogen co-infection rates in adult ticks. Even though
additional larger studies on nymph co-infection are yet to be completed, this primary result
raises questions about the possibilities of co-transmission of these agents to humans (or ani-
mals), their prevalence, the effects of these co-infections on the severity of symptoms, the effi-
cacy of treatments, and how to develop new diagnostic tests better adapted to tick-borne
diseases. We also demonstrated high prevalence of symbionts co-existing with pathogens. It is
now important to address and comprehend their effect on pathogen transmission and/or tick
biology. Improved knowledge on the functional and evolutionary consequences of tick micro-
biota-pathogen interactions should boost the development of new alternative strategies for the
control of ticks and tick-borne pathogens.
