Objective: To develop clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with primary
aldosteronism.
Participants: The Task Force included a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of the
Endocrine Society, six additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The guideline was co-
sponsoredbyAmericanHeartAssociation,AmericanAssociationofEndocrineSurgeons,EuropeanSociety
of Endocrinology, European Society of Hypertension, International Association of Endocrine Surgeons,
InternationalSocietyofEndocrinology,InternationalSocietyofHypertension,JapanEndocrineSociety,and
The Japanese Society of Hypertension. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.
Evidence: We searched for systematic reviews and primary studies to formulate the key treatment and
preventionrecommendations.WeusedtheGradingofRecommendations,Assessment,Development,and
Evaluation group criteria to describe both the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations.
We used “recommend” for strong recommendations and “suggest” for weak recommendations.
Consensus Process: We achieved consensus by collecting the best available evidence and conduct-
ing one group meeting, several conference calls, and multiple e-mail communications. With the
help of a medical writer, the Endocrine Society’s Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs
Core Committee, and Council successfully reviewed the drafts prepared by the Task Force. We
placed the version approved by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee and Clinical Affairs Core
Committee on the Endocrine Society’s website for comments by members. At each stage of review,
the Task Force received written comments and incorporated necessary changes.
Conclusions: For high-risk groups of hypertensive patients and those with hypokalemia, we recommend
case detection of primary aldosteronism by determining the aldosterone-renin ratio under standard con-
ditionsandrecommendthatacommonlyusedconfirmatorytestshouldconfirm/excludethecondition.We
recommend that all patients with primary aldosteronism undergo adrenal computed tomography as the
initial study in subtype testing and to exclude adrenocortical carcinoma. We recommend that an experi-
encedradiologistshouldestablish/excludeunilateralprimaryaldosteronismusingbilateraladrenalvenous
sampling, and if confirmed, this should optimally be treated by laparoscopic adrenalectomy. We recom-
mend that patients with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia or those unsuitable for surgery should be treated
primarily with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 101: 1889–1916, 2016)

 Summary of Recommendations
1.0 Case detection
1.1 We recommend case detection of primary aldosteron-
ism (PA) in patients with sustained blood pressure (BP)
above 150/100 mm Hg on each of three measurements
obtained on different days, with hypertension (BP
�140/90 mm Hg) resistant to three conventional antihy-
pertensive drugs (including a diuretic), or controlled BP
(�140/90 mm Hg) on four or more antihypertensive
drugs; hypertension and spontaneous or diuretic-induced
hypokalemia; hypertension and adrenal incidentaloma;
hypertension and sleep apnea; hypertension and a family
history of early onset hypertension or cerebrovascular ac-
cident at a young age (�40 years); and all hypertensive
first-degree relatives of patients with PA. (1⎪QQEE)
1.2 We recommend using the plasma aldosterone/renin
ratio (ARR) to detect possible cases of PA in these patient
groups. (1⎪QQQE)
2.0 Case confirmation
2.1 Instead of proceeding directly to subtype classifi-
cation, we recommend that patients with a positive ARR
undergo one or more confirmatory tests to definitively
confirm or exclude the diagnosis (1⎪QQEE). However, in
the setting of spontaneous hypokalemia, plasma renin be-
low detection levels plus plasma aldosterone concentra-
tion (PAC) �20 ng/dL (550 pmol/L), we suggest that there
may
is
no
need
for
further
confirmatory
testing.
(2⎪QEEE)
3.0 Subtype classification
3.1 We recommend that all patients with PA undergo
adrenal computed tomography (CT) as in the initial
study in subtype testing to exclude large masses that
may represent adrenocortical carcinoma and to assist
the interventional radiologist and surgeon where ana-
tomically appropriate (Figure 1). (1⎪QQQE)
Figure 1. Algorithm for the detection, confirmation, subtype testing, and treatment of PA. a We recommend unilateral laparoscopic
adrenalectomy for patients with documented unilateral PA (ie, APA or UAH) (1⎪QQQE). If a patient is unable or unwilling to undergo surgery, we
recommend medical treatment including a MR antagonist (1⎪QQQE). If an ARR-positive patient is unwilling or unable to undergo further
investigations, we similarly recommend medical treatment including an MR antagonist (1⎪QQEE). b Instead of proceeding directly to subtype
classification, we recommend that patients with a positive ARR undergo one or more confirmatory tests to definitively confirm or exclude the
diagnosis (1⎪QQEE). However, in the setting of spontaneous hypokalemia, undetectable renin, and PAC �20 ng/dL (550 pmol/L), we suggest
that there may be no need for further confirmatory testing (2⎪QEEE). c We recommend that when surgical treatment is feasible and desired by
the patient, an experienced radiologist should use AVS to make the distinction between unilateral and bilateral adrenal disease (1⎪QQQE).
Younger patients (�age 35) with spontaneous hypokalemia, marked aldosterone excess, and unilateral adrenal lesions with radiological features
consistent with a cortical adenoma on adrenal CT scan may not need AVS before proceeding to unilateral adrenalectomy (2⎪QEEE). [Adapted

 3.2 We recommend that when surgical treatment is fea-
sible and desired by the patient, an experienced radiologist
should use adrenal venous sampling (AVS) to make the
distinction between unilateral and bilateral adrenal dis-
ease (1⎪QQQE). Younger patients (�age 35 years) with
spontaneous hypokalemia, marked aldosterone excess,
and unilateral adrenal lesions with radiological features
consistent with a cortical adenoma on adrenal CT scan
may not need AVS before proceeding to unilateral adre-
nalectomy. (2⎪QEEE)
3.3 In patients with an onset of confirmed PA earlier
than 20 years of age and in those who have a family history
of PA or stroke at a young age (�40 years), we suggest
genetic testing for familial hyperaldosteronism type 1
(FH-I) (glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism [GRA])
(2⎪QQEE). In very young patients with PA, we suggest
testing for germline mutations in KCNJ5 causing familial
hyperaldosteronism type 3 (FH-III). (2⎪QEEE)
4.0 Treatment
4.1 We recommend unilateral laparoscopic adrenalec-
tomy for patients with documented unilateral PA (ie, al-
dosterone-producing adenoma [APA] or unilateral adre-
nal hyperplasia [UAH]) (1⎪QQQE). If a patient is unable
or unwilling to undergo surgery, we recommend medical
treatment including a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)
antagonist (1⎪QQQE). If an ARR-positive patient is un-
willing or unable to undergo further investigations, we
similarly recommend medical treatment including an MR
antagonist. (1⎪QQEE)
4.2 In patients with PA due to bilateral adrenal disease,
we recommend medical treatment with an MR antagonist
(1⎪QQEE); we suggest spironolactone as the primary
agent, with eplerenone as an alternative (Figure 1).
(2⎪QEEE)
4.3 In patients with GRA, we recommend administer-
ing the lowest dose of glucocorticoid to lower ACTH and
thus normalize BP and potassium levels as the first-line
treatment (Figure 1) (1⎪QEEE). In addition, if BP fails to
normalize with glucocorticoid alone, an MR antagonist
may be added. For children, the glucocorticoid dosage
shouldbeadjustedforageandbodyweight,andBPtargets
should be determined from age- and gender-specific pub-
lished normative data.
Foreword
In2008,theEndocrineSocietypublishedclinicalguide-
lines titled The Case Detection, Diagnosis, and Treatment
of Primary Aldosteronism. Consistent with the Institute of
Medicine Standards for Developing Trustworthy Clinical
Practice Guidelines (1), the Endocrine Society plans reg-
ular updates of its guidelines. Therefore, we incorporated
insights from relevant studies over the past 6 years and
updated recommendations on PA. Because PA is common
and has a much higher cardiovascular risk profile than
age-, sex-, and BP-matched essential hypertension, tar-
geted treatment is of obvious benefit to affected patients
with hypertension.
For those with confirmed PA, laparoscopic adrenalec-
tomy for unilateral disease cures hyperaldosteronism and
hypokalemia and cures or substantially reduces elevated
BP. For those with bilateral disease, targeted medical ther-
apy lowers both BP and the deleterious effects of aldoste-
rone hypersecretion. For this reason, we continue to rec-
ommend case detection, diagnosis, and treatment of
hypertensive patient groups with a relatively high preva-
lence of PA.
Where the guidelines differ significantly from the pre-
vious version is in the explicit recognition of PA as a major
public health issue and not merely a matter of case detec-
tion, diagnosis, and treatment of individual patients, as
might be inferred from the 2008 title.
Because case detection (screening) entails follow-up
(confirmation, imaging, AVS, and surgery, if indicated)
and these procedures (where available) are expensive, the
present rate of screening is very low. Therefore, most sub-
jects with PA are never screened. Our recommendation
that a sizeable percentage of those with hypertension un-
dergo screening is thus not a counsel of perfection, but a
clarion call to physicians to substantially ramp up the
screening of hypertensive patients at risk of PA. As the
prevalence of case detection rises, so will demand for
the subsequent steps. More PA patients will thus benefit
from demand-driven diagnosis and effective treatment.
The question then remains of how to address the major
public health issue. Even with modest progress in case
detection, diagnosis, and treatment, the overwhelming
majority of those with hypertension and occult PA (if and
when treated) receive suboptimal care (ie, without tar-
geted MR antagonist therapy). There is no easy solution
for this problem, but we need to recognize that the man-
agement of PA cannot be confined to those fortunate
enough to be screened, diagnosed, and treated.
As physicians, we have a duty to care for all patients
suffering from PA, and we should not ignore or gloss over
the public health issue that results from patients with PA
who go untreated because there are negative consequences
for patient and physician.
Method of Development of Evidence-
Based Guidelines
In 2006, the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) of
the Endocrine Society deemed detection, diagnosis, and

 treatment of patients with PA a priority area in need of
practice guidelines and appointed a seven-member Task
Force to formulate evidence-based recommendations. The
Task Force followed the approach recommended by the
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Develop-
ment, and Evaluation group, an international group with
expertise in the development and implementation of evi-
dence-based guidelines (2). The recommendations and
suggestions made by the Task Force were subject to ex-
tensive consultation before being published in the Journal
of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism in 2008 (3).
Recently,theCGSoftheEndocrineSocietyconcludedthat
we needed an updated set of practice guidelines, and in
2013 it appointed a second seven-member Task Force,
which included members from the earlier group.
Both Task Forces used the best available research evi-
dence to inform the recommendations, and both used con-
sistent language and graphical descriptions of the strength
of a recommendation and the quality of the evidence. In
terms of the strength of the recommendation, strong rec-
ommendations use the phrase “we recommend” and the
number 1, and weak recommendations use the phrase “we
suggest”andthenumber2.Cross-filledcirclesindicatethe
quality of the evidence, such that QEEE denotes very low
quality evidence; QQEE, low quality; QQQE, moderate
quality; and QQQQ, high quality. The Task Force has con-
fidence that patients who receive care according to the
strong recommendations will derive, on average, more
good than harm. Weak recommendations require more
careful consideration of the patient’s circumstances, val-
ues, and preferences to determine the best course of action.
A detailed description of this grading scheme has been
published elsewhere (4).
Linked to each recommendation is a description of the
evidence, the values that panelists considered in making
the recommendation (when necessary), and remarks—a
section where panelists offer technical suggestions for test-
ing conditions, dosing, and monitoring. These technical
comments facilitate the implementation of recommenda-
tions and are often derived from the nonsystematic obser-
vations of the panelists. One should, therefore, consider
them as suggestions.
The Endocrine Society maintains a rigorous conflict-
of-interest review process for clinical practice guidelines.
All Task Force members must declare any potential con-
flicts of interest, which the Endocrine Society reviews both
before and periodically during the development of the
guideline to ensure the integrity of Task Force members.
Specifically, conflict-of-interest forms are vetted by the
CGSbeforetheSociety’sCouncilapprovesthemembersto
participate on the Task Force. Participants in the guideline
development must include a majority of individuals with-
out conflicts of interest in the matter under study. Partic-
ipants with conflicts of interest may participate in the de-
velopment of the guideline, but they must disclose all
conflicts. The CGS and the Task Force have reviewed all
disclosures for this guideline and resolved or managed
all identified conflicts of interest.
Conflicts of interest are defined by remuneration in any
amount from commercial interest(s) in the form of grants;
research support; consulting fees; salary; ownership inter-
est (eg, stocks, stock options, or ownership interest ex-
cluding diversified mutual funds); honoraria or other pay-
ments for participation in speakers’ bureaus, advisory
boards, or boards of directors; or other financial benefits.
Completed forms are available through the Endocrine
Society office.
The Task Force received no funding or remuneration
from commercial or other entities because the Endocrine
Society provided all support for this guideline.
Systematic reviews
The Task Force identified several existing systematic
reviews that addressed various aspects of the diagnosis,
treatment, and overall management of PA. We listed these
in Table 1, which is titled “Summary of Systematic Re-
views Addressing Management of Primary Aldosteron-
ism.” The table also provides an explicit description of the
outcomes and the quality (certainty) of evidence.
Definition and clinical significance of primary
aldosteronism
What is primary aldosteronism?
PA is a group of disorders in which aldosterone pro-
duction is inappropriately high for sodium status, rela-
tively autonomous of the major regulators of secretion
(angiotensin II, plasma potassium concentration), and
nonsuppressible by sodium loading. Such inappropriate
production of aldosterone causes hypertension, cardiovas-
cular damage, sodium retention, suppression of plasma
renin, and increased potassium excretion that (if prolonged
and severe) may lead to hypokalemia. PA is commonly
caused by an adrenal adenoma, unilateral or bilateral ad-
renal hyperplasia (BAH), or in rare cases adrenal carci-
noma or inherited conditions of familial hyperaldosteron-
ism. PA is also known as Conn’s syndrome, in recognition
of the researcher who initially described the disorder, its
prevalence, and its treatment (9–11).
How common is primary aldosteronism?
Most experts previously described PA in �1% of pa-
tients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension and
had assumed that hypokalemia was a sine qua non for
diagnosis (12–18). Accumulating evidence has over-

 turned these assumptions. Cross-sectional and prospec-
tive studies report PA in �5% and possibly �10% of
hypertensive patients, both in general and in specialty
settings (6, 19–29).
How frequent is hypokalemia in primary
aldosteronism?
Only a minority of patients with PA (9 to 37%) has
hypokalemia (20, 26). Thus, normokalemic hypertension
constitutes the most common presentation of the disease,
with hypokalemia probably present in only the more severe
cases. In the largest single study to date, half of the patients
with an APA and 17% of those with idiopathic hyperaldo-
steronism (IHA) had serum potassium concentrations �3.5
mmol/L (20). Thus, the presence of hypokalemia has low
sensitivity, and the absence of hypokalemia has a low nega-
tive predictive value for the diagnosis of PA.
Why is primary aldosteronism important?
This condition is important not only because of its
prevalence, but also because patients with PA have higher
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than age- and sex-
matchedpatientswithessentialhypertensionandthesame
degree of BP elevation (30, 31). Furthermore, specific
treatments are available that ameliorate the impact of this
conditiononimportantpatientoutcomes.TreatingPAeither
by MR antagonists or unilateral adrenalectomy (where in-
dicated) resolves hypokalemia, lowers BP, reduces the num-
ber of antihypertensive medications required, and improves
parameters of impaired cardiac and renal function. There
is continued debate on the noninferiority of medical
treatment for unilateral PA in the longer term, although
the current consensus is that unilateral laparoscopic ad-
renalectomy is the preferred option (32–34).
1.0 Case detection
1.1 We recommend case detection of PA in patients
with sustained BP above 150/100 mm Hg on each of three
measurements obtained on different days, with hyperten-
sion (BP �140/90 mm Hg) resistant to three conventional
antihypertensive drugs (including a diuretic), or controlled
BP (�140/90 mm Hg) on four or more antihypertensive
drugs; hypertension and spontaneous or diuretic-induced
hypokalemia; hypertension and adrenal incidentaloma;
hypertension and sleep apnea; hypertension and a family
history of early onset hypertension or cerebrovascular ac-
cident at a young age (�40 years); and all hypertensive
first-degree relatives of patients with PA. (1⎪QQEE)
Evidence
Table 2 summarizes evidence of the increased preva-
lence of PA in certain patient groups in whom we recom-
mend case detection. There are no clinical trials of screen-
ing that measure the impact of this practice on morbidity,
mortality, or quality-of-life outcomes. Patients could po-
tentially be harmed by the work-up and treatment (ie, by
withdrawal of antihypertensive medication, salt-loading
protocols, invasive vascular examination, adrenalectomy)
aimed at vascular protection and easier and better BP con-
trol. Indirect evidence links the detection of PA with im-
proved patient outcomes. There is strong evidence linking
improved BP control and/or reduction in aldosterone lev-

 els to improved cardiac and cerebrovascular outcomes (33–
37) and quality of life (38). Until prospective studies inform
us differently, we recommend that all hypertensive first-de-
gree relatives of patients with PA undergo ARR testing.
Values
OurrecommendationtodetectcasesofPAplacesahigh
value on avoiding the risks associated with missing a PA
diagnosis (and thus forgoing the opportunity of a surgical
cure or amelioration of excess cardiovascular morbidity
through specific medical treatment); and it places a lower
value on avoiding the risk of falsely classifying a hyper-
tensive patient as having PA and exposing him or her to
additional diagnostic testing. Our recommendation also
places a high value on avoiding the risk associated with
missing a diagnosis of unilateral forms of PA and thus the
opportunity of possibly curative intervention by unilateral
adrenalectomy leading to the reduction or complete ces-
sation of antihypertensive medications (39) and the re-
duction of target organ damage (32, 36, 40), and it places
a lower value on avoiding the risks of exposing patients
with bilateral PA (who are rarely candidates for surgical
treatment) to additional diagnostic testing.
1.2 We recommend using the plasma ARR to detect
possible cases of PA in these patient groups. (1⎪QQQE)
Evidence
TheARRiscurrentlythemostreliablemeansavailablefor
screening for PA. Although valid estimates of test character-
isticsoftheARRarelacking(mainlyduetolimitationsinthe
design of studies that have addressed this issue) (8), numer-
ous studies have demonstrated the ARR to be superior in
measuring potassium or aldosterone (both of which have
lower sensitivity) or renin (which is less specific) in isolation
(39, 41, 42). Importantly, laboratories need to report indi-
vidual values for both PAC and plasma renin activity (PRA)/
plasma renin concentration, as well as the ARR.
Like all biochemical case detection tests, the ARR is not
without false positives and false negatives (43). Table 3
documents the effect of medications and conditions on the
ARR. The ARR should therefore be regarded as a detec-
tion test only and should be repeated if the initial results
are inconclusive or difficult to interpret due to suboptimal
sampling conditions (eg, maintenance of some medica-
tions listed in Table 3), or if PA is strongly suspected clin-
ically but the initial screening results are negative.
Values
Similar values underpin our recommendation to target
subjects in groups with a documented high prevalence of
PA and perform ARR testing. In particular, this recom-

Groups With High Prevalence of PA
Patient Group
Prevalence
Moderate/severe hypertension: the prevalence rates cited here are from Mosso et al (27).
Others have reported similar estimates (28, 67, 163, 206). We based the classification
of BP for adults (aged �18 y) on the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on
Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (207), which
establishes three different stages: Stage 1 � SBP 140–159 mm Hg, DBP 90–99 mm
Hg; Stage 2 � SBP 160–179 mm Hg, DBP 100–109 mm Hg; Stage 3 � SBP �180
mm Hg, DBP � �110 mm Hg (23). When systolic and diastolic BPs were in different
categories, the higher category was selected to classify the individual’s BP status.
Overall, 6.1%. Stage 1 (mild), 2%.
Stage 2 (moderate), 8%. Stage 3
(severe), 13%.
Resistant hypertension, defined as SBP �140 mm Hg and DBP �90 mm Hg despite
treatment with three hypertensive medications (56, 193, 208–211).

Hypertensive patients with spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia.
Specific prevalence figures are not
available, but more frequently
found in this group.
Hypertension with adrenal incidentaloma (141, 212–216), defined as an adrenal mass
detected incidentally during imaging performed for extra-adrenal reasons.
Median, 2% (range, 1.1–10%). One
retrospective study that excluded
patients with hypokalemia and
severe hypertension found APA in
16 of 1004 subjects (215).
Hypertension with obstructive sleep apnea (217, 218).
34% among newly hypertensive
patients referred to a tertiary
referral center and found to have
obstructive sleep apnea.

 mendation acknowledges the costs currently associated
with ARR testing of all patients with essential hyperten-
sion. Against this recommendation for selective testing,
however, one must weigh the risk of missing or at least
delaying the diagnosis of PA in some hypertensive indi-
viduals. The consequences of this may include the later
development of more severe and/or resistant hypertension
resulting from failure to lower levels of aldosterone or to
block its actions. The duration of hypertension has been
reported by several investigators to be a negative predictor
of outcome after unilateral adrenalectomy for APA (44,
45), suggesting that delays in diagnosis may result in a
poorer response to specific treatment once PA is finally
diagnosed.
Remarks: technical aspects required for the correct
implementation of recommendation
Testing conditions
The ARR test is most sensitive when samples are col-
lected in the morning after patients have been out of bed
for at least 2 hours, usually after they have been seated for
5–15 minutes (Table 4). Ideally, patients should have un-
restricted dietary salt intake before testing and should be
potassium-replete. In particular, MR antagonists should
be withdrawn for at least 4 weeks before ARR testing. In
many cases, the ARR can be confidently interpreted de-
spite the effect of continued medications or other subop-
timal conditions of testing, thus avoiding delay and/or
allowing the patient to proceed directly to confirmatory/
exclusion testing. A washout of all interfering antihyper-
tensive medications is feasible in patients with mild hy-
pertension but is potentially problematic in others. The
complete cessation of all antihypertensive treatment is
usually unnecessary because there are substitute medica-
tions that have a minimal effect on the ARR (Table 5). If
all potentially problematic agents cannot be safely with-
drawn, an ARR should be performed and the results con-
sidered in the light of the potential confounding factors.
For example, in some patients with severe PA, treatment
with an MR antagonist cannot be safely discontinued; in
this setting, PA-related testing can be pursued as long as
renin is suppressed.
Assay reliability
Clinicians can use an immunometric assay to measure
renin either by testing for PRA or for direct renin concen-
tration (DRC); tandem mass spectrometry methodology
for measuring PRA has also been developed recently (46).
PRA takes into account factors (such as estrogen-contain-
ing preparations) that affect endogenous substrate levels.
It is preferable that the low-level control material for PRA/
DRC comprises a human pool of low-level PRA/DRC
samples aliquoted and stored at �80°C that have a PRA
value of approximately 0.5 ng/mL/h or a DRC value of
approximately 5 ng/L. Because the ARR is mathematically
highly dependent on renin (47), renin assays should be
sufficiently sensitive to measure levels as low as 0.2–0.3

a Renin inhibitors lower PRA, but raise DRC. This would be expected to
result in false-positive ARR levels for renin measured as PRA and false
negatives for renin measured as DRC.
b In premenopausal, ovulating women, plasma aldosterone levels
measured during the menses or the proliferative phase of the
menstrual cycle are similar to those of men but rise briskly in the luteal
phase. Because renin levels are lower, the ARR is higher than in men
for all phases of the cycle, but especially during the luteal phase during
which aldosterone rises to a greater extent than renin. False positives
can occur during the luteal phase, but only if renin is measured as DRC
and not PRA. In preliminary studies, some investigations have found
false positives on the current cutoffs for women in the luteal phase.
Accordingly, it would seem sensible to screen women at risk in the
follicular phase, if practicable.

 ng/mL/h (DRC, 2 mU/L) (23, 27). Although some labo-
ratories still use RIA for plasma and urinary aldosterone,
measured levels of standards have been shown to be un-
acceptably different in some instances (48). The available
RIAs for plasma aldosterone overestimate levels by 50–
100% in the range below 200 pmol/L, most probably from
cross-reactivity with soluble aldosterone metabolites (49).
Published studies have included numerous tandem mass
spectrometrymethodsthathaveaffordedapathwaytoassay
standardization and improved analytical accuracy (50).
Interpretation
A limitation of the ARR is that in the presence of very
low renin levels (for example, at PRA values of 0.1 ng/
mL/h), the ARR may be elevated even when plasma aldo-
sterone is also low (for example, 4 ng/dL or 110 pmol/L)
and is almost certainly not consistent with PA. To avoid
this problem, some investigators include a minimum PAC
of �15 ng/dL (410 pmol/L) within the screening criteria
(51). However, in one study seated plasma aldosterone
levels were �15 ng/dL (�420 pmol/L) in 36% of 74
patients diagnosed with PA who screened positive by
ARR and whose aldosterone failed to suppress during the
fludrocortisone-suppression test (FST) and in four of 21
patients found by AVS to have unilateral, surgically cor-
rectable PA (52); a reasonable inference from this study is
that relatively low PAC (that is �15 ng/dL) may be more
commoninBAHthaninpatientswithAPA.Anotherstudy
reported plasma aldosterone levels of 9–16 ng/dL (250–
440 pmol/L) in 16 of 37 patients diagnosed with PA by
FST (27). Some investigators therefore proceed with a di-
Table 4.
Measurement of ARR: A Suggested Approach
A. Preparation: agenda
1. Attempt to correct hypokalemia. Measure plasma potassium in blood collected slowly with a syringe and needle
[preferably not a Vacutainer to minimize the risk of spuriously raising potassium]. During collection, avoid fist
clenching, wait at least 5 seconds after tourniquet release (if used) to achieve insertion of needle, and ensure
separation of plasma from cells within 30 minutes of collection. A plasma [K�] of 4.0 mmol/L is the aim of
supplementation.
2. Encourage patient to liberalize (rather than restrict) sodium intake.
3. Withdraw agents that markedly affect the ARR (219) for at least 4 weeks:
a. Spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride, and triamterene
b. Potassium-wasting diuretics
c. Products derived from licorice root (eg, confectionary licorice, chewing tobacco)
4. If the results of ARR after discontinuation of the above agents are not diagnostic, and if hypertension can be controlled
with relatively noninterfering medications (see Table 5), withdraw other medications that may affect the ARR (219) for
at least 2 weeks, such as:
a. �-Adrenergic blockers, central �-2 agonists (eg, clonidine, �-methyldopa), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
b. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, renin inhibitors, and dihydropyridine
calcium channel antagonists
5. If necessary to maintain hypertension control, commence other antihypertensive medications that have lesser effects on
the ARR (e.g. verapamil slow-release, hydralazine [with verapamil slow-release, to avoid reflex tachycardia], prazosin,
doxazosin, terazosin; see Table 5).
6. Establish OC and HRT status because estrogen-containing medications may lower DRC and cause false-positive ARR
when DRC (rather than PRA) is measured (220). Do not withdraw OC unless confident of alternative effective
contraception.
B. Conditions for blood collection
1. Collect blood midmorning, after the patient has been up (sitting, standing, or walking) for at least 2 hours and seated
for 5–15 minutes.
2. Collect blood carefully, avoiding stasis and hemolysis (see A.1 above).
3. Maintain sample at room temperature (and not on ice, as this will promote conversion of inactive to active renin)
during delivery to laboratory and prior to centrifugation and rapid freezing of plasma component pending assay.
C. Factors to take into account when interpreting results (see Table 3)
1. Age: in patients aged �65 years, renin can be lowered more than aldosterone by age alone, leading to raised ARR.
2. Gender: premenstrual, ovulating females have higher ARR levels than age-matched men, especially during the luteal
phase of the menstrual cycle, during which false positives can occur, but only if renin is measured as DRC and not as
PRA (220).
3. Time of day, recent diet, posture, and length of time in that posture
4. Medications
5. Method of blood collection, including any difficulty doing so
6. Level of potassium
7. Level of creatinine (renal failure can lead to false-positive ARR)

 agnostic workup for PA in all patients with elevated ARR
unless the PAC is below the level used to define normal
suppression during confirmatory suppression testing (eg,
for the FST, 6 ng/dL or 170 pmol/L) (53). Although a
disadvantage of this approach is that the likelihood of a
false-positive ARR will be greater, this is counterbalanced
byalowerlikelihoodofmissingPA.Of125patientswhohad
APAs removed, 20 (16%) had upright midmorning plasma
aldosterone levels of �15 ng/dL, and five (4%) had levels
�10 ng/dL (280 pmol/L) (43). Therefore, whereas the like-
lihoodofmissingAPAatlevels�10ng/dLappearstobelow,
the risk may be greater for PA patients with BAH.
The lack of uniformity in diagnostic protocols and as-
say methods for measuring the ARR has been associated
with substantial variability in cutoff values (24–26, 53–
56). Table 6 lists ARR cutoff values using some commonly
expressed assay units for PAC, PRA, and the direct mea-
surement of plasma renin concentration.
2.0 Case confirmation
2.1 Instead of proceeding directly to subtype classifi-
cation, we recommend that patients with a positive ARR
undergo one or more confirmatory tests to definitively
confirm or exclude the diagnosis (1⎪QQEE). However, in
the setting of spontaneous hypokalemia, plasma renin be-
low detection levels, plus PAC �20 ng/dL (550 pmol/L),
we suggest that there may be no need for further confir-
matory testing. (2⎪QEEE)
Evidence
The current literature does not identify a “gold stan-
dard” confirmatory test for PA. Most studies evaluated
test performance retrospectively in a relatively small series
of patients selected with high prior (pretest) probability of
PA and commonly in comparison with other tests, rather
than toward a conclusive diagnosis of PA.
Someoftheselimitationsareillustratedinthefollowing
example. There is empirical evidence that case-control de-
signs for establishing the accuracy of diagnostic tests over-
estimate their accuracy. Giacchetti et al (57) used such a
design in a study of 61 PA patients (26 with confirmed
APA) and 157 patients with essential hypertension. In this
context, they found that a postsodium infusion test with a
cutoffvalueforplasmaaldosteroneof7ng/dL(195pmol/L),

a Values shown are on the basis of a conversion factor of PRA (ng/mL/h)
to DRC (mU/L) of 8.2. DRC assays are still in evolution, and in a
recently introduced and already commonly used automated DRC assay,
the conversion factor is 12 (see text). It should be noted that there is
poor correlation between DRC and PRA in the range where PRA is �1
ng/mL/h, the domain of major interest in PA screening (221, 222).
b The most commonly adopted cutoff values are 30 for PAC and PRA
in conventional units (equivalent to 830 when PAC is in SI units) and
750 when PAC is expressed in SI units (equivalent to 27 in
conventional units).

 curve analysis, showed a sensitivity of 88% and a speci-
ficity of 100% in the 76 cases with ARR �40 ng/dL per
ng/mL/h (3.1 pmol/L/min).
IntheprospectivePrimaryAldosteronismPrevalencein
Hypertensives study, the analysis of sensitivity/specificity
in the 317 patients who underwent a saline infusion test
(SIT) gave a best aldosterone cutoff value of 6.8 ng/dL
(190 pmol/L). However, the sensitivity and specificity were
moderate (83 and 75%, respectively), reflecting values over-
lappingbetweenpatientswithandwithoutdisease;usingthe
aldosterone-cortisol ratio did not improve the accuracy of
the test (58). The same authors reported that the captopril
challenge test (CCT) showed similar accuracy when per-
formed under adequate sodium intake conditions (58), al-
though Mulatero et al (59) suggested caution in the inter-
pretationoftheCCTbecauseofdifferencesbetweenpatients
regarding the bioavailability of the drug.
Nanba et al (60) performed a more complex evaluation
of three tests (SIT, CCT, and the furosemide upright test
[FUT]) in hypertensive patients who tested positive for PA
byARR.TheCCTandFUTshowedsimilarlevels(�90%)
of confirmation/exclusion, whereas the SIT showed lower
levels of agreement (�65%) with either the CCT or FUT.
Given the similar results of CCT and FUT and the low
sensitivity of SIT, the authors proposed that one test (CCT
�FUT)shouldbesufficienttoconfirmthediagnosisofPA.
Finally, Willenberg et al (61) reported divergent results
between the SIT and FST and also found a lower cutoff
value for SIT than FST; this was in contrast with Mulatero
et al (62, 63), who reported a satisfactory agreement be-
tween the two tests.
Four testing procedures (oral sodium loading, saline
infusion, fludrocortisone suppression, and captopril chal-
lenge) are thus in common use, with the FUT also in use in
Japan (64, 65). Despite the reports cited above, definitive
evidence that one single test is optimal is lacking, and there
is still insufficient direct evidence to recommend one over
all the others. Although these tests may differ in terms of
sensitivity, specificity, and reliability, the choice of con-
firmatory test is commonly determined by considering
cost, patient compliance, laboratory routine, and local ex-
pertise (Table 7).
Clinicians should use caution when administering con-
firmatory tests requiring oral or iv sodium loading in pa-
tients with uncontrolled hypertension or congestive heart
failure and should avoid furosemide in subjects at risk of
arrhythmia. We recommend that clinicians utilize the
pharmacological agents with minimal or no effects on the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system shown in Table 5 to
control BP during confirmatory testing (66). Clinicians
should avoid medications known to stimulate renin dur-
ing confirmatory testing because these prevent the sup-
pression of aldosterone (false positive).
In fact, the reproducibility of SITs performed twice af-
terrecommendeddrugwithdrawalhasbeenreportedtobe
84% (66), whereas maintaining established therapy (ex-
cluding diuretics and MR antagonists) on one of the two
occasions was associated with a reproducibility of only
66% (66). In patients with a baseline PAC �24 ng/dL (670
pmol/L), PAC remained nonsuppressible after the two
SITs in both experimental conditions. Nanba et al (60)
reported similar data after CCT. These findings support
an alternative approach, as already suggested by authors
who claim that the diagnosis of PA can be made confi-
dently in patients with a combination of a high ARR and
a high level of plasma and urinary aldosterone (51, 67).
Given the possible variability in repeat PAC and ARR
measurements (68, 69), Letavernier et al (70) consider PA
to be present if separate measurements show high recum-
bent ARR (�63 pmol/mU; 23 ng/mU) plus high PAC
(�500 pmol/L; 15 ng/dL) or high upright PAC �550
pmol/L (16.5 ng/dL) or urinary aldosterone levels (�63
nmol/d; 25 �g/d). At the other end of the spectrum, a study
reported patients with unilateral hypersecretion at AVS with
normal baseline PAC (52); similarly, patients with suppress-
ible aldosteronism on SIT may lateralize on AVS, reflecting
the existence of an angiotensin-responsive APA (71).
Finally, researchers have proposed two additional con-
firmatory tests. The first is the dexamethasone-enhanced
FST, whereby roughly 30% of referred hypertensives
show PAC values above the range found in normotensive
controls (72). Inpreliminarystudies,aseated(asopposedto
the usual recumbent) SIT has shown remarkable agreement
withtheFST,incontrastwithmuchpoorercongruenceofthe
recumbent SIT and FST (73). Of 24 patients with confirmed
PA,23(96%)testedpositivebyseatedSITcomparedtoonly
eight (33%) by recumbent SIT (P � .001). If larger studies
confirm these findings, seated SIT may represent a reliable
and more practicable alternative to FST.
Values
Confirmatory testing places a high value on sparing
patients with false-positive ARR tests from undergoing
costly and intrusive lateralization procedures.

we describe procedures, interpretations, and concerns in

PA Confirmatory Tests
Test and Procedure
Interpretation
Concerns
Oral sodium loading test
Patients should increase their sodium intake to
�200 mmol (�6 g)/d for 3 d, verified by 24-
h urine sodium content.
PA is unlikely if urinary aldosterone is �10 �g/
24 h (28 nmol/d) in the absence of renal
disease where PA may coexist with lower
measured urinary aldosterone levels.
This test should not be performed in patients
with severe uncontrolled hypertension,
renal insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmia, or
severe hypokalemia.
Patients should receive adequate slow-release
potassium chloride supplementation to
maintain plasma potassium in the normal
range.
Urinary aldosterone is measured in the 24-h
urine collection from the morning of day 3 to
the morning of day 4.
Elevated urinary aldosterone excretion (�12
�g/24 h [�33 nmol/d] at the Mayo Clinic;
�14 �g/24 h [39 nmol/d] at the Cleveland
Clinic) makes PA highly likely.
24-h urine collection may be inconvenient.
Laboratory-specific poor performance of
the RIA for urinary aldosterone
(aldosterone 18-oxo-glucuronide or acid
labile metabolite) may blunt diagnostic
accuracy—a problem obviated by the
currently available HPLC-tandem mass
spectrometry methodology (223).
Aldosterone 18-oxo-glucuronide is a renal
metabolite, and its excretion may not rise
in patients with renal disease.
SIT
Patients stay in the recumbent position for at
least 1 h before and during the infusion of 2
L of 0.9% saline iv over 4 h, starting at
8–9.30 AM. Blood samples for renin,
aldosterone, cortisol, and plasma potassium
are drawn at time zero and after 4 h, with BP
and heart rate monitored throughout the
test. In a modified approach, which appears
(in preliminary studies) to have much higher
sensitivity for diagnosing PA, patients remain
in a seated position for at least 30 min and
during the infusion (73).
Postinfusion plasma aldosterone levels �5 ng/
dL (140 pmol/L) make the diagnosis of PA
unlikely, whereas levels �10 ng/dL (280
nmol/L) are a sign of very probable PA.
Values between 5 and 10 ng/dL are
indeterminate, although a cutoff of 6.8 ng/
dL (190 pmol/L) has been found to offer the
best trade-off between sensitivity and
specificity (57, 58, 224, 225). For the seated
SIT, a postinfusion plasma aldosterone of �6
ng/dL (170 pmol/L) confirms PA, provided
plasma cortisol concentration is lower than
the value obtained basally (to exclude a
confounding ACTH effect) (73).
This test should not be performed in patients
with severe uncontrolled hypertension,
renal insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmia, or
severe hypokalemia.
FST
Patients receive 0.1 mg oral fludrocortisone
every 6 h for 4 d, together with slow-release
KCl supplements (every 6 h at doses
sufficient to keep plasma K�, measured four
times a day, close to 4.0 mmol/L), slow-
release NaCl supplements (30 mmol three
times daily with meals) and sufficient dietary
salt to maintain a urinary sodium excretion
rate of at least 3 mmol/kg body weight. On
day 4, plasma aldosterone and PRA are
measured at 10 AM with the patient in the
seated posture, and plasma cortisol is
measured at 7 and 10 AM.
Upright plasma aldosterone �6 ng/dL (170
nmol/L) on day 4 at 10 AM confirms PA,
provided PRA is �1 ng/mL/h and plasma
cortisol concentration is lower than the value
obtained at 7 AM (to exclude a confounding
ACTH effect) (39, 52, 53, 112, 226).
Although some centers (23, 27) conduct this
test in the outpatient setting (provided
that patients are able to attend frequently
to monitor their potassium), in other
centers several days of hospitalization are
customary.
Most of the data available come from the
Brisbane group (39, 52, 53, 89, 112, 226)
who have established, on the basis of a
very large series of patients, a cutoff of a
PAC of 6 ng/dL (170 nmol/L) at 10 AM in
an ambulatory patient on day 4.
Proponents of the FST argue that: a) it is
the most sensitive for confirming PA; b)
it is a less intrusive method of sodium
loading than SIT and therefore less likely
to provoke non-renin-dependent
alterations of aldosterone levels; c) it
allows for the potentially confounding
effects of potassium to be controlled,
and for ACTH (via cortisol) to be
monitored and detected; and d) it is safe
when performed by experienced hands.
Captopril challenge test
Patients receive 25–50 mg of captopril orally after
sitting or standing for at least 1 h. Blood samples
are drawn for measurement of PRA, plasma
aldosterone, and cortisol at time zero and at 1 or
2 h after challenge, with the patient remaining
seated during this period.
Plasma aldosterone is normally suppressed by
captopril (�30%). In patients with PA it remains
elevated and PRA remains suppressed (58, 60,
163, 227). Differences may be seen between
patients with APA and those with IAH, in that
some decrease of aldosterone levels is
occasionally seen in IAH (228).
There are reports of a substantial number of
false-negative or equivocal results (59,
229).

 exclude large masses that may represent adrenocortical
carcinoma and to assist the interventional radiologist
and surgeon where anatomically appropriate (Figure 1).
(1⎪QQQE)
Evidence
Clinicians use the findings from adrenal CT—normal-
appearing adrenals, unilateral macroadenoma (�1 cm),
minimal unilateral adrenal limb thickening, unilateral mi-
croadenomas (�1 cm), or bilateral macro- or microad-
enomas (or a combination of the two)—in conjunction
with AVS and (if needed) ancillary tests to guide treatment
decisions in patients with PA. APA may appear as small
hypodense nodules (usually �2 cm in diameter) on CT.
Idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia (IAH) adrenal glands may
be normal on CT or may show nodular changes. Aldoste-
rone-producing adrenal carcinomas are almost always �4
cm in diameter, but occasionally smaller, and like most
adrenocortical carcinomas have a suspicious imaging phe-
notype on CT (51, 74). Large benign-appearing unilateral
masses may represent an aldosterone- and cortisol-secret-
ing adenoma. If this proves to be the case on dexameth-
asone suppression testing, some centers require AVS,
whereas others proceed directly to unilateral adrenalec-
tomy; in either case, patients will require hydrocortisone
support postoperatively.
Adrenal CT has several limitations. Radiologists might
interpret small APAs incorrectly as “IAH” on the basis of
CT findings of bilateral nodularity or normal-appearing
adrenals. Moreover, apparent adrenal microadenomas
may actually represent areas of hyperplasia or nonfunc-
tioning nodularity, and unilateral adrenalectomy would
be inappropriate. In addition, nonfunctioning unilateral
adrenal macroadenomas are not uncommon, especially in
older patients (�age 35 years) (75), and are indistinguish-
able from APAs on CT. UAH may be visible on CT, or the
UAH adrenal may appear normal on CT.
In one study of 203 patients with PA who were evalu-
ated with both CT and AVS, CT was accurate in only 53%
of patients (76). On the basis of CT findings, 42 patients
(22%) would have been incorrectly excluded as candi-
dates for adrenalectomy, and 48 (25%) might have had
unnecessary or inappropriate surgery (76). In another
study, 41 patients had AVS, and the concordance between
CT and AVS was only 54% (77). In a systematic review of
38 studies with 950 patients with PA, CT and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) misdiagnosed the cause of PA in
37.8% of patients (7). Therefore, AVS is essential to direct
appropriate therapy in patients with PA who seek a po-
tential surgical cure. CT is particularly useful, however,
for detecting larger lesions (eg, �4 cm) that may warrant
consideration for removal based on malignant potential
(51, 74). In addition, CT is useful for localizing the right
adrenal vein as it enters into the inferior vena cava, thus
aiding cannulation of the vein during AVS (78, 79). Fi-
nally, the findings on CT may be very helpful in young
patients with marked PA (see below).
Remarks
MRI has no advantage over CT in subtype evaluation
of PA because it is more expensive and has less spatial
resolution than CT.
3.2 We recommend that when surgical treatment is fea-
sible and desired by the patient, an experienced radiologist
should use AVS to make the distinction between unilateral
and bilateral adrenal disease (1⎪QQQE). Younger pa-
tients (�age 35 years) with spontaneous hypokalemia,
marked aldosterone excess, and unilateral adrenal lesions
with radiological features consistent with a cortical ade-
noma on adrenal CT scan may not need AVS before pro-
ceeding to unilateral adrenalectomy. (2⎪QEEE)
Evidence
Lateralizationofthesourceoftheexcessivealdosterone
secretion is critical to guide the management of PA. Dis-
tinguishing between unilateral and bilateral disease is im-
portant because unilateral adrenalectomy in all patients
with APA or UAH results in the normalization of hypo-
kalemia; hypertension is also improved in all and cured in
30–60% of these patients (32, 44, 80, 81). In bilateral
IHA and GRA, unilateral or bilateral adrenalectomy sel-
dom corrects the hypertension (82–86), and medical ther-
apy is the treatment of choice (87). Unilateral disease may
be treated medically if the patient declines or is not a can-
didate for surgery.
Imaging cannot reliably visualize microadenomas or
distinguish nonfunctioning incidentalomas from aldoste-
rone-producing adenomas with confidence (76) in most
patients, making AVS the most accurate means of differ-
entiating unilateral from bilateral forms of PA. AVS is
expensive and invasive, and so it is highly desirable to
avoid this test in patients who do not have PA (88). Be-
cause ARR testing can be associated with false positives,
confirmatory testing should eliminate the potential risk
that patients with false-positive ARR undergo AVS.
The sensitivity and specificity of AVS (95 and 100%,
respectively) for detecting unilateral aldosterone excess
are superior to that of adrenal CT (78 and 75%, respec-
tively) (76, 77, 89). Importantly, CT has the potential to
be frankly misleading by demonstrating unilateral adrenal
nodules in patients with bilateral disease, and thereby
leading to inappropriate surgery.
AVS is the “gold standard” test to distinguish unilateral
(APA or UAH) from bilateral (IHA) disease in patients

 with PA (76, 89). AVS can be a difficult procedure, espe-
cially in terms of successfully cannulating the right adrenal
vein (which is smaller than the left and usually empties
directly into the inferior vena cava rather than the renal
vein); however, the success rate usually improves as the
angiographer becomes more experienced. According to a
review of 47 reports, the success rate for cannulating the
right adrenal vein in 384 patients was 74% (87). With
experience, the success rate increases to 90–96% (76, 78,
79, 90, 91). The addition of rapid intra-procedural mea-
surement of adrenal vein cortisol concentrations has fa-
cilitated improved accuracy of catheter placement in AVS
(92–97). Some centers perform AVS in all patients who
have the diagnosis of PA (89, 94). However, in patients
younger than 35 years with marked PA (eg, spontaneous
hypokalemia; PAC �30 ng/dL, 831 pmol/L) and solitary
unilateral apparent adenoma on CT scan, a case can be
made to proceed directly to unilateral adrenalectomy
without prior AVS (76, 98–101) (Figure 1). In a recent
study, of 87 PA patients, a subset of 26 presented with a
typical APA on CT and serum potassium �3.5 mmol/L
and/or an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least
100 mL/min/1.73 m2; all had unilateral PA (100% spec-
ificity, 95% confidence interval, 91 to 100; and 53% sen-
sitivity,95%confidenceinterval,38to68)(71).However,
the utility of these three criteria was not reproducible in
two recently published studies (100, 102).
At centers with experienced AVS radiologists, the com-
plication rate is 2.5% or lower (76, 78, 103). The risk of
adrenal hemorrhage can be minimized by employing a
radiologist skilled in the technique, avoiding adrenal
venography,andlimitingtheuseofcontrasttothesmallest
amounts necessary to assess the catheter tip position (79).
Where there is a clinical suspicion of a procoagulant dis-
order, the risk of thromboembolism, which is very low in
AVS, may be further reduced by performing tests for such
conditions before the procedure and administering hepa-
rin after the procedure in patients at risk.
Values
Our recommendation to include AVS in the subtype
evaluation of most patients with PA who are candidates
for surgery places a high value on avoiding the risk of an
unnecessary unilateral adrenalectomy based on adrenal
CT and a relatively low value on avoiding the potential
complications of AVS.
Remarks
A radiologist experienced with and dedicated to AVS is
necessary to implement this recommendation. There are
three protocols for AVS: 1) unstimulated sequential or
simultaneous bilateral AVS; 2) unstimulated sequential or
simultaneous bilateral AVS followed by bolus cosyntro-
pin-stimulated sequential or simultaneous bilateral AVS;
and 3) continuous cosyntropin infusion with sequential
bilateral AVS. Simultaneous bilateral AVS is difficult to
perform and is not used at most centers (104). Many
groups advocate the use of continuous cosyntropin infu-
sion during AVS to: 1) minimize stress-induced fluctua-
tionsinaldosteronesecretionduringnonsimultaneous(se-
quential) AVS; 2) maximize the gradient in cortisol from
adrenal vein to inferior vena cava and thus confirm suc-
cessful sampling of the adrenal vein (105); and 3) maxi-
mize the secretion of aldosterone from an APA (76, 84, 90,
106, 107), and thus avoid the risk of sampling during a
relatively quiescent phase of aldosterone secretion. Clini-
cians should avoid administering medications known to
stimulate renin in patients undergoing AVS, in that it may
lead to the stimulation of the adrenal contralateral to an
APA, and unilateral PA might be misclassified as bilateral.
The criteria used to determine the lateralization of al-
dosteronehypersecretiondependonwhetherthesampling
is done under cosyntropin administration. Dividing the
right and left adrenal vein PACs by their respective cortisol
concentrationscorrectsfordilutionaleffectsoftheinferior
phrenic vein flowing into the left adrenal vein and, if sub-
optimallysampled,ofinferiorvenacavaflowintotheright
adrenal vein. These are termed “cortisol-corrected aldo-
sterone ratios.” With continuous cosyntropin administra-
tion, clinicians use a cutoff of the cortisol-corrected aldo-
sterone ratio from high-side to low-side of more than 4:1
to indicate unilateral aldosterone excess (76, 108); a ratio
of �3:1 is suggestive of bilateral aldosterone hypersecre-
tion (76). With these cutoffs, AVS for detecting unilateral
aldosterone hypersecretion (APA or UAH) has a sensitiv-
ity of 95% and specificity of 100% (76). Patients with
lateralization ratios between 3:1 and 4:1 may have either
unilateral or bilateral disease, and the AVS results must be
cautiously interpreted in conjunction with the clinical set-
ting, CT scan, ancillary tests, and if possible, repeat AVS.
The contralateral suppression of aldosterone secretion has
recently been reported to be helpful in the diagnosis of
unilateral PA (109, 110).
Some investigators consider a cortisol-corrected aldo-
sterone lateralization ratio (high to low side) of more than
2:1 in the absence of cosyntropin as consistent with uni-
lateral disease (88, 104, 108). Other groups rely primarily
on comparing the adrenal vein aldosterone-cortisol ratios
to those in a simultaneously collected peripheral venous
sample (89). When the aldosterone-cortisol ratio from an
adrenal vein is significantly (usually at least 2.5 times)
greater than that of the peripheral vein (cubital fossa or
inferior vena cava), and the aldosterone-cortisol ratio in
the contralateral adrenal vein is no higher than peripheral

 (indicating contralateral suppression), this is interpreted
as showing lateralization, an indication that unilateral ad-
renalectomy should cure or improve the hypertension.
Cosyntropin use
If clinicians do not use cosyntropin infusion, they
should perform AVS in the morning hours after overnight
recumbency. This approach avoids the confounding ef-
fects of changes in posture on aldosterone levels in patients
with angiotensin II-responsive varieties of PA and takes
advantage of the effect of high early morning endogenous
ACTH levels on aldosterone production in all subtypes of
PA (79).
If clinicians use cosyntropin infusion, it may be contin-
uous or bolus. For continuous cosyntropin, clinicians
should begin an infusion of 50 �g/h of cosyntropin 30
minutes before adrenal vein catheterization and continue
it throughout the procedure (76, 84, 90). The bolus co-
syntropin technique involves AVS before and after the iv
administration of 250 �g of cosyntropin. However, some
groups have suggested that when clinicians administer a
bolus injection of cosyntropin and sample the adrenal
veins simultaneously, cosyntropin does not improve the
diagnostic accuracy of AVS, and, in fact, cosyntropin may
increase secretion from the nonadenomatous gland to a
greater degree than from the APA (20).
Catheterization
Clinicians (commonly interventional radiologists) catheter-
ize the adrenal veins using the percutaneous femoral vein
approach and verify the position of the catheter tip by
radiography after injecting a small amount of nonionic
contrast medium (78, 111). Blood from both adrenal veins
and a peripheral vein (labeled peripheral) is taken and
assayed for aldosterone and cortisol concentrations. To
ensure no cross-contamination, the “peripheral” sample
should come from a cubital or iliac vein.
Clinicians typically obtain the venous sample from the
left side with the catheter tip at the junction of the inferior
phrenic and left adrenal vein. The right adrenal vein may
be especially difficult to catheterize because it is short and
enters the inferior vena cava at an acute angle (90). Cli-
nicians use the cortisol concentrations from the adrenal
veins and peripheral veins to confirm successful catheter-
ization. The adrenal/peripheral vein cortisol ratio is typ-
ically more than 5:1 with the continuous cosyntropin in-
fusion protocol (76, 104, 108) and more than 2:1 without
cosyntropin use (104, 112).
If both adrenal veins are not successfully catheterized,
the decision may be to: 1) repeat AVS; 2) treat the patient
medically; or 3) consider surgery based on the findings of
other diagnostic tests, as previously noted. A posture stim-
ulation test or iodocholesterol scintigraphy may further
guide the clinician in this setting.
Posture stimulation test
In patients with unsuccessful AVS and with a CT scan
showing a unilateral adrenal mass, some experts use the
posture stimulation test. This test, developed in the 1970s,
was based on the finding that the PAC in patients with
APA showed diurnal variation and was relatively unaf-
fected by changes in angiotensin II levels, whereas IAH
was characterized by enhanced sensitivity to a small
changeinangiotensinIIthatoccurredwithstanding(113).
In a review of 16 published reports, the accuracy of the
posture stimulation test was 85% in 246 patients with
surgically verified APA (87). The lack of accuracy is ex-
plained by the fact that some APAs are sensitive to angio-
tensin II and some patients with IHA have diurnal varia-
tions in aldosterone secretion (114). Thus, the posture
stimulation test—particularly if it shows a lack of respon-
siveness (consistent with angiotensin II-unresponsive APA
or hyperaldosteronism type 1 [FH-I], with the latter read-
ily confirmed or excluded by genetic testing)—may serve
an ancillary role, for example, in those patients for whom
AVS was unsuccessful and CT shows a unilateral adrenal
mass (115, 116).
Iodocholesterol scintigraphy
Clinicians first used (131I)-19-iodocholesterol scintig-
raphy in the early 1970s (117), and an improved agent,
(6�-131I) iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NP-59), was in-
troduced in 1977 (118). The NP-59 scan, performed with
dexamethasone suppression, had the putative advantage
of correlating function with anatomical abnormalities.
However, the sensitivity of this test depends heavily on the
size of the adenoma (119, 120). Because tracer uptake is
poor in adenomas smaller than 1.5 cm in diameter, this
method often is not helpful in interpreting micronodular
findings obtained with high-resolution CT (121) and
rarely plays a role in subtype evaluation. Currently iodo-
cholesterol scintigraphy is no longer used in the United
States, but it remains in use in Japan and other countries.
18-Hydroxycorticosterone levels
18-Hydroxycorticosterone (18-OHB) is formed by 18-
hydroxylation of corticosterone. Patients with APA gen-
erally have recumbent plasma 18-OHB levels greater than
100 ng/dL at 8:00 a.m., whereas patients with IAH have
levels that are usually less than 100 ng/dL (122). In one
study, 18-hydroxycortisol, 18-oxocortisol, and 18-OHB
were higher in patients with APA than in patients with
IHA or essential hypertension (123). In addition, measur-
ing 18-oxocortisol may have some utility during AVS

 (124). More recently, the same group has shown a con-
siderable degree of separation between APA and IHA,
with less than 40% of patients not able to be allocated to
one or the other on the basis of 18-oxocortisol measure-
ments (125). Until these latter data are reproduced else-
where, these surrogates and predictors of APA may guide
the clinician in selecting patients for AVS but should not
be used to direct surgical management (87).
(11)C-Metomidate positron emission
tomography-computed tomography
Metomidate is a potent inhibitor of adrenal steroido-
genic enzymes. A study of 25 patients with PA that used
(11)C-metomidate—a positron emission tomography ra-
diotracer—reported a specificity of 87% and sensitivity of
76% for APA (126). In the future, APA-specific positron
emission tomography radiotracers may have a major role
in the subtype evaluation of PA.
3.3 In patients with an onset of confirmed PA earlier
than 20 years of age and in those who have a family history
of PA or strokes at a young age (�40 years), we suggest
genetic testing for FH-I (GRA) (2⎪QQEE). In very young
patients with PA, we suggest testing for germline muta-
tions in KCNJ5 causing FH-III. (2⎪QEEE)
Evidence
Testing for familial forms of primary aldosteronism:
familial hyperaldosteronism type 1 (glucocorticoid
remediable aldosteronism)
The FH-I syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dom-
inant fashion and is responsible for 1% of cases of PA
(127, 128). The mutation in patients with GRA is fusion
of the promoter region of the gene for CYP11B1 and the
coding sequences of CYP11B2, resulting in a CYP11B1/
CYP11B2 chimeric gene. GRA is a form of hyperaldoste-
ronism in which the hypersecretion of aldosterone is depen-
dent upon endogenous ACTH secretion, which activates
aldosterone synthesis. GRA presentation is highly variable,
with some patients presenting with normal BP and some
characterized by aldosterone excess, suppressed PRA, and
hypertension of early onset that is usually severe and refrac-
tory to conventional antihypertensive therapies.
SomestudiessuggestahighpretestprobabilityforGRA
in children or young adults with severe or resistant hyper-
tension and a positive family history of early onset hyper-
tension and/or premature hemorrhagic stroke (129, 130).
In the study by Dluhy et al (129), 50% of children �18
years of age with GRA had moderate or severe hyperten-
sion (BP �99th percentile for age and sex) at diagnosis.
Moreover, Litchfield et al (130) reported that in 376 pa-
tients from 27 genetically proven GRA pedigrees, 48% of
all GRA pedigrees and 18% of all GRA patients had cere-
brovascular complications, with the mean age at the time
of the initial event being 32 � 11.3 years. Seventy percent
of events were hemorrhagic strokes with an overall case
fatality rate of 61% (130). The study design used in these
reports does not allow for the estimation of the yield of
new GRA patients that case detection could have permit-
ted in such populations.
Genetic testing by either Southern blot (131) or long
PCR (132) techniques for the underlying hybrid CYP11B1/
CYP11B2 mutation is sensitive and specific for GRA and
should replace indirect testing (eg, urinary levels of 18-
oxocortisol and 18-hydroxy-cortisol, or dexamethasone
suppression testing), both of which may be misleading
(133). Genetic testing for GRA should be considered for
PA patients with a family history of PA or of strokes at a
young age (130, 134), or with onset at a young age (eg,
�20 years).
Testing for familial forms of primary aldosteronism:
familial hyperaldosteronism type II
FH-II is an autosomal dominant disorder and possibly
genetically heterogeneous (135). Unlike FH-I, the hyper-
aldosteronism in FH-II does not suppress with dexameth-
asone, and GRA mutation testing is negative (136). FH-II
families may have APA, IAH, or both and are clinically
indistinguishable from patients with apparent nonfamilial
PA (39). Although FH-II is more common than FH-I, ac-
counting for at least 7% of patients with PA in one series,
its true prevalence is unknown (39). In a recent monocen-
tric prospective study of 199 index cases with PA, system-
atic screening for FH-II in family members resulted in 12
additional families (6%) with 35 affected members (128).
The molecular basis for FH-II is unclear, although several
linkage analyses have shown an association with chromo-
somal region 7p22 (135, 137). In a recent European mul-
ticenter study of 46 members from 21 families with sus-
pected FH-II (after exclusion of FH-I) (123), one family
was found to have a germline mutation in the potassium
channel gene KCNJ5 (consistent with a diagnosis of FH-
III). Therefore, patients with KCNJ5 mutations may be
clinically incorrectly classified as affected by FH-II. Mem-
bers of two different families had somatic KCNJ5 muta-
tions in APA tissue removed at unilateral adrenalectomy,
demonstrating that genetics of FH-II is complex and may
involve multiple genetic steps.

severe hypertension in early childhood associated with hy-

 pertensive therapy, requiring bilateral adrenalectomy
(138).ThecauseofFH-IIIisamutationintheKCNJ5gene
encoding the potassium channel Kir 3.4 (potassium in-
wardly rectifying channel, subfamily 1, member 5). Mu-
tations occur near the selectivity filter for potassium,
resulting in increased sodium conductance and cell depo-
larization. This opens voltage-activated calcium channels
leading to increased calcium signaling, followed by in-
creased aldosterone production and cell proliferation
(139). Meanwhile, five more families with FH-III have
been described. In one study of four families with FH-III,
nine of 10 affected subjects were diagnosed at age 6 or
younger,withhalfundergoingbilateraladrenalectomyfor
uncontrolled PA (140). In an Italian family, the index case
was found to be hypertensive at age 18 and responded well
to triple antihypertensive therapy, including low-dose spi-
ronolactone,demonstratingthattheFH-IIIphenotypecan

Genetic events in sporadic aldosterone-producing
adenomas
Starting in 2011, causative somatic mutations in key
proteins of adrenal zona glomerulosa cells have been de-
tected in APAs, constitutively altering the function of po-
tassium and calcium channels and ion pumps. Some of the
mutationsareassociatedwithdistinctphenotypicandbio-
chemical characteristics. The detection of the mutational
status of the removed adenoma has no current clinical
implications for treatment.
KCNJ5 gene
Calcium-dependent signaling is of particular relevance
for zona glomerulosa cells to regulate aldosterone secre-
tion. Glomerulosa cell membrane depolarization leads to
the opening of voltage-dependent Ca2� channels and the
activation of the calcium-signaling pathway. Recently, so-
matic heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in the
KCNJ5 gene have been shown in APAs from PA patients
with severe hypertension and hypokalemia (139). The dif-
ferent hot spot mutations identified in APA (p.G151R and
p.L168R) and FH-III (p.T158A) are all clustered near or
within the selectivity filter of potassium channel Kir3.4
and affect the ion selectivity of the channel, with increased
sodium conductance leading to chronic membrane depo-
larization.Thesechangesareresponsibleforincreasedcal-
cium influx into the cell, leading to constitutive secretion
of aldosterone and possibly cell proliferation (35, 141).
Since its first publication, large collections of sporadic
APAs have been screened worldwide, demonstrating that
KCNJ5 mutations are present in 10 to 68% of APAs (142–
145). Patients with KCNJ5 mutations are younger on pre-
sentation, and more often female than male.
ATP1A1 and ATP2B3
Recently, researchers have described recurrent somatic
mutations in two new genes, ATP1A1, coding for the
�-subunit of the Na�/K�-ATPase, and ATP2B3, coding
for the plasma membrane calcium-transporting ATPase 3
(PMCA3) (146). The mutations occurred in highly con-
servedregionsinvolvedininteractionwiththetransported
cation, potassium for Na�/K�-ATPase and calcium for
PMCA3. In vitro studies have shown that the ATP1A1
mutations significantly reduced Na�/K�-pump activity,
as well as the apparent affinity of Na�/K�-ATPase for K�.
Somatic ATP1A1 mutations were present in 5.2% and
ATP2B3 mutations in 1.6% of patients. Patients carrying
these somatic adrenal mutations commonly show in-
creased plasma aldosterone and lower potassium than
noncarriers, similar to patients with somatic KCNJ5 mu-
tations. However, in contrast with patients with somatic
KCNJ5 mutations, ATPase mutations are more common
in males (146).
CACNA1D gene
Two jointly published studies from the United States
and the United Kingdom reported somatic mutations in a
gene (CACNA1D) encoding a voltage-gated calcium
channel (147, 148). The mutations were found in 11 and
5% zona glomerulosa-like APAs without KCNJ5 muta-
tions. The CACNA1D mutations affect conserved sites
within functional domains of the Cav1.3 channels respon-
sible for the channel activation gate. This increases intra-
cellular Ca2� entry leading to Ca2�-mediated signaling
and enhanced aldosterone secretion. In addition, Scholl et
al (147) reported de novo (ie, not inherited) but germline
mutationsinCACNA1Dintwochildrenwithapreviously
undescribed syndrome featuring PA and neuromuscular
abnormalities.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1
Finally, APA may rarely but on occasion be seen in
multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.
4. Treatment
Cardiovascular complications
Hypertension is the rule in patients diagnosed with PA
and is cured or improved by unilateral adrenalectomy in
patients with unilateral disease and improved by MR an-
tagonists in the remaining patients. In addition, aldoste-
rone excess has deleterious effects on the cardiovascular
system, at least partly independent of its effects on BP. The
pathophysiology was first established in animal models
and subsequently was clearly demonstrated by several
studies on PA patients (149). Such studies showed in-
creased left ventricular (LV) dimensions and myocardial

 fibrosis (150–152), increased carotid intima-media thick-
ness (153, 154), and increased femoral pulse wave velocity
and reduced endothelial function (155).
Several outcome studies also have provided evidence
that PA patients are particularly at risk of cardiovascular/
renal complications, including arrhythmias, myocardial
infarction, strokes, chronic kidney disease, and death,
compared with age-, sex-, and BP-matched essential hy-
pertensives (30, 33, 156). It is therefore not sufficient
merely to control hypertension in patients with PA be-
cause increased LV wall thickness and reduced diastolic
function have been shown in normotensive patients with
FH-I (31).
The Framingham Offspring Study suggested the in-
volvement of aldosterone in the development of arterial
hypertension in the general population, in which plasma
aldosterone levels in normotensive subjects predicted sub-
sequent increases in BP and the development of hyperten-
sion (157). This observation suggests that PA and MR
overactivation play a crucial role in not only cardiovas-
cular complications but also a risk of developing hyper-
tension. Recent reports from the German Conn’s registry
showed cardiovascular mortality to be the main cause of
death in PA; however, these reports also showed that
whereas cardiovascular mortality is increased in patients
treated for PA, all-cause mortality is not different from
matched hypertensive controls (33).
Either unilateral adrenalectomy or MR antagonist
therapy can reverse the cardiovascular morbidity caused
by aldosterone excess (158). Researchers reported that
arterial stiffness (measured as carotid-femoral pulse wave
velocity and augmentation index) was reduced by unilat-
eral adrenalectomy but not after 1 year of spironolactone
treatment in PA (159). Catena et al (36) showed surgery to
be more effective than spironolactone treatment in reduc-
ing LV mass after 1 year, but overall reduction from base-
line was comparable by the end of the study (mean follow-
up, 6.4 years). A recent nationwide survey in Japan
showed that surgical therapy improved both hypertension
and hypokalemia more than medical therapy in unilateral
and/or bilateral aldosterone-producing adenomas; one
possible caveat is that eplerenone was not used in the sur-
vey (160). Overall, these data provide compelling support
for early detection of individuals with PA who can then
benefit from improved cardiovascular outcomes affected
by specific surgical or medical treatment.
4.1 We recommend unilateral laparoscopic adrenalec-
tomy for patients with documented unilateral PA (ie, APA
or UAH) (1⎪QQQE). If a patient is unable or unwilling to
undergo surgery, we recommend medical treatment in-
cluding a MR antagonist (1⎪QQQE). If an ARR-positive
patient is unwilling or unable to undergo further investi-
gations, we similarly recommend medical treatment in-
cluding an MR antagonist. (1⎪QQEE)
Evidence
Cliniciansuseunilaterallaparoscopicadrenalectomyin
patients with unilateral PA because BP and serum potas-
sium concentrations improve in nearly 100% of patients
postoperatively (80, 161–165). Hypertension is cured (de-
fined as BP �140/90 mm Hg without the aid of antihy-
pertensive drugs) in about 50% (range, 35–80%) of pa-
tients with APA after unilateral adrenalectomy (32, 38,
81, 161), with a “cure” rate as high as 56–77% when the
cure threshold is BP �160/95 mm Hg (44, 166, 167),
which is clearly still in the hypertensive range. There is
little high-quality evidence linking adrenalectomy with
improved quality of life, morbidity, or mortality. Re-
cently, however, a large case-control study demonstrated
a similar mortality of patients with PA treated with either
adrenalectomy or MR antagonists compared with mor-
tality of patients with essential (primary) hypertension
(33). In addition, adrenalectomy induces a significant and
sustained reduction in LV mass index due to a reduction
in LV diameter and volume with a reduction in LV work-
load (improvement in diastolic dysfunction) (32). Adre-
nalectomy also appears to reverse the increase in carotid
intima-media thickness and arterial stiffness in patients
with unilateral PA (34). Two prospective studies also re-
ported the reversal of albuminuria 1 year after adrenalec-
tomy (40, 168), and another study reported significant
improvement in quality of life by 3 months sustained at 6
months (38).
Factors associated with hypertension resolution in the
postoperative period include having one or no first-degree
relative with hypertension and preoperative use of two or
fewer antihypertensive drugs (80). Other factors that have
been reported to predict cure, but have only been evalu-
ated by univariate analysis or when the cutoff for BP res-
olution was �160/95 mm Hg (44, 161), include: duration
of hypertension �5 years (44, 45, 80, 81), higher PAC:
PRA ratio preoperatively (80, 81), higher urinary aldo-
sterone secretion (80, 81), or positive preoperative re-
sponse to spironolactone (81, 162). The most common
reasons for persistently increased BP after adrenalec-
tomy are coexistent primary hypertension (of unknown
cause) (44, 80) and older age and/or longer duration of
hypertension.
Compared with open adrenalectomy, laparoscopic ad-
renalectomy is associated with shorter hospital stays and
fewer complications (163, 169, 170). Because AVS is able
to identify only which gland (and not which part of the
gland) is overproducing aldosterone, partial adrenalec-
tomy (removal of an adenoma leaving the remaining

 adrenal intact) may result in persistent hypertension. Con-
tinued PAC elevation is found in up to 10% of patients
with unilateral APA, and 27% of extirpated adrenal
glands are found to contain multiple nodules (171).
Medical management is recommended for patients
who do not undergo surgery. In a retrospective study of 24
patients with APA who were treated for 5 years with spi-
ronolactone or amiloride, systolic and diastolic BP de-
creased from an average of 175/106 to 129/79 mm Hg
(172), with 83% of these patients requiring additional
antihypertensive medication to achieve this result. Side
effects of spironolactone are dose-dependent and include
gynecomastia, breast engorgement, erectile dysfunction,
and muscle cramps. In the long-term, adrenalectomy is
more cost-effective than lifelong medical therapy for pa-
tients with unilateral PA (173, 174).
Therefore, because unilateral laparoscopic adrenalec-
tomy can either eliminate the need for medication or re-
duce medication-related side effects, it is the preferred pro-
cedure for the treatment of unilateral disease in patients
with PA.
Values
Our recommendation that laparoscopic adrenalec-
tomy is preferable to other methods of treatment in pa-
tientswithunilateraladrenaldiseaseplacesahighvalueon
the normalization of endogenous aldosterone secretion,
the resolution of hypokalemia, and the reduction of BP
and/or the number of medications necessary to control BP.
This benefit is far greater than the risks of surgery and
postoperative management, which are very low.
Remarks
This recommendation requires the availability of a sur-
geon experienced in laparoscopic adrenalectomy.
Preoperative management
Both hypertension and hypokalemia should be well
controlled before patients undergo surgery. Obtaining
such control may require a delay in surgery and the addi-
tion of an MR antagonist.
Postoperative management
Clinicians should measure plasma aldosterone and
renin activity levels shortly after surgery as an early indi-
cation of biochemical response (165), although renin lev-
els may not fall immediately. They should also withdraw
potassium supplementation on postoperative day 1, dis-
continue spironolactone, and reduce antihypertensive
therapy, if appropriate (175).
Postoperative iv fluids should be normal saline without
potassium chloride unless serum potassium levels remain
very low (ie, �3.0 mmol/L); during the first few weeks
after surgery, clinicians should recommend a generous so-
dium diet to avoid the hyperkalemia that can develop from
hypoaldosteronism due to chronic contralateral adrenal
gland suppression (175, 176). Persistent hypoaldosteron-
ism requiring mineralocorticoid replacement therapy
(fludrocortisone) may occur in up to 5% of adrenalecto-
mized patients (176). Preoperative reduced glomerular
filtration rate and increased serum creatinine as well as
postoperative increased creatinine and microalbuminuria
are significant predictors of postoperative hyperkalemia
(176).
BP typically normalizes or shows maximum improve-
ment in 1–6 months after unilateral adrenalectomy for
unilateral APA but can continue to fall for up to 1 year in
some patients. Some investigators have employed postop-
erative FST (performed at least 3 months after surgery to
permit recovery of the contralateral gland) to assess
whether the PA has been cured from a biochemical per-
spective (177). Seated SIT, which appears in preliminary
analysis to be much more sensitive than recumbent SIT for
diagnosing PA (73), holds promise as a more practical
alternative to FST in this regard, but has yet to undergo
formal evaluation in the postoperative setting.
4.2 In patients with PA due to bilateral adrenal dis-
ease, we recommend medical treatment with an MR
antagonist (1⎪QQEE); we suggest spironolactone as the
primary agent, with eplerenone as an alternative (Figure
1). (2⎪QEEE)
Evidence
Bilateral adrenal disease includes IAH, bilateral APA,
and GRA. In 99 surgically treated patients with IAH re-
ported in the literature, the hypertension cure rate was
only 19% after unilateral or bilateral adrenalectomy (82–
86). A randomized controlled trial has demonstrated that
spironolactone may be more effective than eplerenone in
controlling BP in patients with PA, albeit the doses of
spironolactonewerehigherthancommonlyemployedand
eplerenone was only given once daily (178). In a smaller
study, eplerenone and spironolactone were in contrast
found to be equipotent in reducing BP in patients with
confirmed PA (179). However, the pathophysiology of PA
due to BAH and long-standing clinical experience suggest
several pharmacological targets.
MR antagonists
MR antagonists appear to be effective at controlling BP
and protecting target organs independent of effects on BP.

 Spironolactone
For more than five decades, the MR antagonist spi-
ronolactone has been the agent of choice in the medical
treatment of PA. Several observational studies in patients
with IAH (combined n � 122) have reported mean reduc-
tions in systolic BP of 25% and diastolic BP of 22% in
response to spironolactone 50–400 mg/d for 1–96
months (180–186). In a study of 28 hypertensive subjects
with an ARR �750 pmol/L (27 ng/dL)/ng/mL/h who
failed to suppress their PAC after salt loading and had no
evidence of adenoma on adrenal CT scan, spironolactone
therapy (25–50 mg/d) reduced the need for antihyperten-
sive drugs by 0.5 drugs (from a mean of 2.3 to 1.8 drugs)
and reduced systolic BP by 15 mm Hg (from a mean of 161
to 146 mm Hg) and diastolic BP by 8 mm Hg (from a mean
of 91 to 83 mm Hg); 48% of subjects achieved a BP
�140/90 mm Hg, and about half were able to be managed
with spironolactone monotherapy (187). The dose of spi-
ronolactone the study employed was much lower than
previously considered necessary for the treatment of PA.
The incidence of gynecomastia with spironolactone
therapy is dose-related, with one study reporting an inci-
denceafter6monthsof6.9%atadose�50mg/dand52%
at a dose �150 mg/d (188). The exact incidence of men-
strual disturbances in premenopausal women with spi-
ronolactone therapy is unknown. Where available, can-
renone (an active metabolite of spironolactone) or
potassium canrenoate (its open E-ring water soluble con-
gener) might be considered. In addition, a small dose of a
thiazide diuretic, triamterene, or amiloride can be added
to attempt to avoid a higher dose of spironolactone, which
may cause side effects.
Eplerenone
Eplerenoneisanewer,selectiveMRantagonistwithout
antiandrogen and progesterone agonist effects (189), thus
reducing the rate of adverse endocrine side effects. It has
been approved for the treatment of primary (essential)
hypertension (190, 191) in the United States and Japan,
and for heart failure after myocardial infarction (192) in
the United States and a number of other countries. Epler-
enone in vivo has 50% of the MR antagonist potency of
spironolactone. Its better tolerability profile needs to be
balanced against its higher cost and the possibility that
spironolactone may lower BP more effectively than epler-
enone in the medical treatment of PA (178). Reflecting its
shorterhalf-life,eplerenoneshouldbegiventwicedailyfor
optimal effect.
Other agents
The up-regulation of distal tubular sodium epithelial
channel activity is a major mechanism whereby aldoste-
rone exerts its actions on sodium and potassium handling.
Of the two available epithelial sodium channel antago-
nists amiloride and triamterene, amiloride has been the
more studied as a mode of treatment for PA. Although less
efficacious than spironolactone (193, 194), amiloride
does have some advantages. Being a potassium-sparing
diuretic, amiloride can ameliorate both hypertension and
hypokalemia in patients with PA and is generally well tol-
erated. It lacks the sex steroid-related side effects of spi-
ronolactone but does not provide the beneficial effects on
endothelial function (195, 196).
Calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting en-
zyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers have
been evaluated in very few patients with PA, and in general
they are antihypertensive without a major effect on MR
activation. They are, nevertheless, commonly used to
lower BP (in combination with MR antagonists) if BP re-
mains above normal. Aldosterone synthase inhibitors may
play a role in the future.
Values
This recommendation places a relatively higher value
onnormalizingserumpotassiumconcentrations;reducing
BP; and eliminating the vascular, cardiac, and renal effects
of aldosterone with the minimum number of pharmaco-
logical agents, and a relatively lower value on side effects
such as gynecomastia and erectile dysfunction in men and
menstrual irregularities in women. Eplerenone, given its
selectivity and despite its cost, is an alternative if the side
effects of spironolactone prove difficult to tolerate.
Remarks
The starting dose for spironolactone should be 12.5 to
25 mg/d in a single dose. The lowest effective dose should
be found by very gradually titrating upward, if necessary,
to a maximum dose of 100 mg/d. The starting dose for
eplerenone is 25 mg twice daily. In patients with stage III
chronic kidney disease (ie, glomerular filtration rate �60
mL/min/1.73 m2), clinicians should administer spirono-
lactone and eplerenone with caution because of the risk of
hyperkalemia; clinicians should avoid administering MR
antagonists in patients with stage IV disease.
Observations suggest that patients with PA may have
reversible reduction in intrarenal vascular resistance and
glomerular hyperfiltration, which may disguise the under-
lying renal injury, including declining glomerular filtra-
tion rate and albuminuria (40, 197). Treating PA by ad-
renalectomy or with an MR antagonist frequently
unmasks the underlying reduction in renal function in pa-
tients with PA (198, 199).
4.3 In patients with GRA, we recommend administer-
ing the lowest dose of glucocorticoid to lower ACTH and

 thus normalize BP and potassium levels as first-line treat-
ment (Figure 1) (1⎪QEEE). In addition, if BP fails to nor-
malize with glucocorticoid alone, an MR antagonist may
be added. For children, glucocorticoid dosage should be
adjusted for age and body weight, and BP targets should
be determined from age- and gender-specific published
normative data.
Evidence
GRA should be treated medically with a glucocorticoid
to partially suppress pituitary ACTH secretion. We rec-
ommend administering a synthetic glucocorticoid that is
longer acting than hydrocortisone, such as dexametha-
sone or prednisone, to suppress ACTH secretion. Ideally,
the glucocorticoid should be taken at bedtime to suppress
the early morning ACTH surge. Plasma renin activity
and aldosterone concentrations may be helpful in assess-
ing the effectiveness of treatment and the prevention of
overtreatment.
Overtreatment with exogenous steroids must be avoid-
ed; iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome and impaired linear
growth in children have resulted from such overdosing
(129). In general, clinicians should use the lowest possible
dose of glucocorticoid that normalizes BP and/or serum
potassium concentration (79). Treating with a glucocor-
ticoid may not always normalize BP, and clinicians should
consider adding an MR antagonist in these cases. Treat-
ment targets for BP in children should be determined from
published age- and gender-specific normative data (200,
201). Glucocorticoid doses in children vary by age and
body weight (128).
The use of eplerenone may be preferred in the case of
affected children, in whom there may be concerns with
respect to growth retardation and the antiandrogenic ef-
fects of glucocorticoids and spironolactone, respectively.
Values
The treatment of GRA places a high value on prevent-
ing the potential consequences of hyperaldosteronism and
a lower value on the possible side effects of chronic glu-
cocorticoid administration.
Remarks
The starting dose of dexamethasone in adults is 0.125–
0.25 mg/d. The starting dose of prednisone is 2.5–5 mg/d.
For each, treatment is usually administered at bedtime.
Perspectives
The revised guidelines make recommendations and
suggestions for the management of PA on the evidence,
both scientific and societal. Over the next 5 years, man-
agement should have further evolved; as a guide to where
progress might (and should) be made, we offer the fol-
lowing commentary.
There are currently on the market only two classes of
MR agonists (MRAs). Spironolactone and its congeners
canrenone and potassium canrenoate are generation 1,
with high MR affinity but major side effects due to non-
selectivity. Eplerenone is the generation 2 MRA, with low
MR affinity, but it is selective (and expensive); both have
an obligate effect of an elevation in plasma potassium in
subjects without PA, thus limiting their use. In many coun-
tries, eplerenone is not approved for hypertension (includ-
ingPA);insomecountriesevenspironolactoneisnoteasily
reimbursableforhypertension.Thesideeffectsofspirono-
lactone are well known and an issue in terms of compli-
ance; eplerenone is more expensive than spironolactone.
Diabetes is not a contraindication to the use of eplerenone,
despite the package insert, providing patients are carefully
monitored in terms of plasma (K�) and renal function.
In the next 5 years, it is likely that generation 3 MRAs
(nonsteroidal,aspotentasspironolactone,andasselective
as eplerenone) and perhaps selective aldosterone synthase
inhibitors will be available for the treatment of PA. For
additional uses of MRAs (eg, heart failure, fibrotic disor-
ders), generation 4 MRAs may also be available (non-
steroidal,potent,selective,andtubulesparingtolessenthe
extent of elevating plasma potassium).
Over the same period, there will need to be a number of
advances within the medical centers where clinicians refer
patients with possible PA. At present, we have only esti-
mates of the annual numbers of patients diagnosed and
treated (medically or surgically) for PA. We need registries
(such as those that exist in Germany) on a regional and/or
national basis; in conjunction with these registries, there
should also be blood and tissue biobanks.
We urgently need the revision of an agreement on nor-
mal ranges for PAC, DRC, and PRA, with standardized
and quality-controlled assays. If the normal range for PAC
is 3–31 ng/dL in Ancona, Italy, and 4–21 ng/dL in Roch-
ester, Minnesota, we have not only a 2-fold difference in
range for what is considered normal, but also a strong
indication that such a 5- to 10-fold variation in “normal”
PAC may reflect not only differences in sodium intake but
also variations in sensitivity to aldosterone (as have been
shown between African Americans and those of Cauca-
sian ancestry) (202).
Over the next 5 years, we may settle upon on a rapid,
inexpensive, and safe confirmatory/exclusion test for pa-
tients with possible PA on screening. In preliminary stud-
ies, a seated SIT proved far superior to the conventional
recumbent SIT, and equivalent to the FST. The possibility
thatinclusionofovernightdexamethasonewoulduncover
an additional approximately 20% of hypertensives with

 inappropriate aldosterone secretion, as found in the dex-
amethasone-enhanced FST, represents a major possible
advance.
Many practicing physicians were taught that PA is a
rare and benign cause of hypertension, and in terms of
diagnosis and treatment thus merely a footnote to the
management of hypertension as a whole. Cardiologists
usually write guidelines for hypertension with some input
from nephrologists and clinical pharmacologists and little
or none from endocrinologists; the recent European So-
ciety of Hypertension Guidelines (203) nicely illustrate
this point.
In the next 5 years, cardiologists and endocrinologists
need to work together so that those whose responsibility
is primary care are made keenly aware that the prevalence
of PA, as currently defined, is roughly 10% in hyperten-
sives, and that it is even higher in certain groups (hypo-
kalemia, higher BP, resistant hypertension), with another
roughly 20% having “inappropriate aldosterone secre-
tion” and responding specifically to MRAs.
Nationally (204) and internationally (205), hyperten-
sion is recognized as the most significant risk factor for
death and disability. Within hypertension, 5% of patients
have florid PA, predominantly APA, and another 5% have
clear but less florid PA, primarily IAH. As noted above, in
an additional approximately 20% of patients (resistant
hypertension,lowreninhypertension),MRAsareremark-
ably effective in lowering BP. It is also established that
within hypertension, patients with PA have a much higher
risk of atrial fibrillation, nonfatal myocardial infarct, and
stroke than age-, sex-, and BP-matched essential hyper-
tensives; in some centers patients presenting with atrial
fibrillation have both TSH and ARR measured. All of
these factors taken together clearly indicate that PA is a
major public health issue requiring urgent attention and
concerted action.
Refinements in the diagnosis and treatment of PA,
some of which are listed above, are almost certain to
emerge over the next 5 years; the main strategy is to
convince primary care physicians to screen for PA in all
at-risk hypertensive patients. To this end, three things
(at least) are desirable, and the first immediately
practicable.
First, in parallel with these guidelines (which are tar-
geted at endocrinologists and other specialists involved in
the diagnosis and treatment of PA), we are developing a
simple and accessible guideline for screening and referral
for widespread national and, if possible, international
distribution.
Secondly, and very urgently, the development of meth-
ods to measure PAC and DRC in the same sample, as an
aid to screening in primary care, are currently in develop-
ment. Optimally, a point-of-care test to accurately mea-
sure PAC and DRC—analogous to the currently available
strips for plasma glucose, D-dimer, etc—would be a game-
changerfortheprimarycarephysician.Whetherornotthe
current strict regime of drug withdrawal is totally neces-
sary is an area of conjecture and debate; if the test is in-
expensive enough, it may be that only MRAs absolutely
need to be withdrawn before screening.
Finally, and debatably, it may be appropriate that
at-risk patients who do not undergo screening routinely
have a low-dose MRA included in their antihyperten-
sive regimen.
5.0 What is new?
The revised 2015 guidelines for the management of PA
build on and extend the 2008 guidelines in a number of
areas, as follows:
• Broadenedindicationsforscreening,toincludesubjects
withsustainedBPelevationabove150mmHg(systolic)
and/or 100 mm Hg (diastolic).
• Recognition that stringent cutoffs for ARR and PAC
produce a positive rate of approximately 5% of hyper-
tensives with PA as so defined, most of whom have a
unilateral APA; less stringent cutoffs give a positive rate
of 10%, with the majority having IAH as the source of
autonomous aldosterone secretion.
• Details of recent findings establishing somatic muta-
tions as (currently) the explanation of aldosterone hy-
persecretion in approximately 50% of APA, and of sim-
ilar germline mutations in FH-III.
• Strengthening the case for timely diagnosis and treat-
ment of PA, based on mounting evidence for cardio-
vascular and renal damage.
• Explicit recommendations for referral by primary care
physicians of patients with suspected PA to specialized
centers for further work-up.
• Explicit suggestions for an abbreviated work-up in pa-
tients with spontaneous hypokalemia, renin levels be-
low the detection limit plus florid hyperaldosteronism.
• Enhanced communication among and between care
providers to optimize outcomes for patients with con-
firmed PA.
• Recognition that capacity constraints mean that most
patients with PA will be unable to be screened in the
foreseeable future, and that given the heightened risk
profile of PA and its frequency in hypertension, occult
PA constitutes a major public health issue.
