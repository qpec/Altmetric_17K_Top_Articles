ABSTRACT
Breathlessness in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is often discordant with
airway pathophysiology (“over-perception”). Pulmonary rehabilitation profoundly affects breathlessness,
without influencing lung function. Learned associations influence brain mechanisms of sensory perception.
We hypothesised that improvements in breathlessness with pulmonary rehabilitation may be explained by
changing neural representations of learned associations.
In 31 patients with COPD, we tested how pulmonary rehabilitation altered the relationship between
brain activity during a breathlessness-related word-cue task (using functional magnetic resonance
imaging), and clinical and psychological measures of breathlessness.
Changes in ratings of breathlessness word cues positively correlated with changes in activity in the
insula and anterior cingulate cortex. Changes in ratings of breathlessness-anxiety negatively correlated with
activations in attention regulation and motor networks. Baseline activity in the insula, anterior cingulate
cortex and prefrontal cortex correlated with improvements in breathlessness and breathlessness-anxiety.
Pulmonary rehabilitation is associated with altered neural responses related to learned breathlessness
associations, which can ultimately influence breathlessness perception. These findings highlight the
importance
of
targeting
learned
associations
within
treatments
for
COPD,
demonstrating
how
neuroimaging may contribute to patient stratification and more successful personalised therapy.

ORIGINAL ARTICLE
COPD
 Introduction
Breathlessness is an “all-consuming and life-changing” experience that is subjective, intensely personal and
is associated with profound fear [1, 2]. It is the primary symptom of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD). The severity of breathlessness is frequently discordant with airway pathophysiology [3].
The most effective treatment for breathlessness in stable COPD is pulmonary rehabilitation [4]. It benefits
both personal well-being and exercise capacity, but has no measurable effect on lung function [5]. The
clinical response to pulmonary rehabilitation is variable. Approximately 40% of people who complete
pulmonary rehabilitation derive no measurable benefit [6].
Recently there has been a step-change in the neuroscientific understanding of sensory perception,
emphasising the importance of top-down perceptual processing [2, 7]. So far, these models have been
most rigorously tested in the field of visual neuroscience. A recent review by VAN DEN BERGH et al. [7]
explains how such models may relate to respiratory symptom perception. Traditionally, it has been
thought that peripheral sensory information is modulated by brain processes such as learning, expectation
and negative affect, which influence conscious perceptions of the sensation (e.g. breathlessness) [8]. Recent
models suggest that sensory perception includes a more prominent top-down process [7, 9]. Instead of
being a stimulus-response organ that passively waits for ascending inputs, the brain forms predictions
constructed from previous experiences (otherwise known as “priors”). These priors are then updated or
corrected by neural observations of incoming sensory information [7, 9]. Negative affect, attention and
interoceptive ability may act as moderators within this system, adjusting either the priors or weighting
(gain) of incoming sensory information to influence symptom discordance.
Priors are generated in a stimulus valuation network comprising the anterior insula, anterior cingulate
cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex [9], which generate information and
predictions about bodily state and emotion. Incoming sensory information is then fed into this network,
via the periaqueductal gray and posterior insula [10, 11]. The link between learned associations (that
influence priors) and respiration has been well demonstrated in a number of experimental studies using
conditioning to demonstrate how associative learning influences respiratory perception and its neural
processing [10–16]).
In COPD, repeated episodes of breathlessness might reinforce learned associations with context-relevant
cues (e.g. stairs, steep hills). These learned associations may then influence the brain’s set of priors. Strong
priors may dominate conscious perception, accompanied by reduced gain in sensory processing regions.
Taken together, these processes could facilitate decoupling of symptoms from objective physiology. This
decoupling is further supported by depression and anxiety [17]. Worsening breathlessness then drives a
downward spiral of activity avoidance and physical deconditioning, and ever-worsening breathlessness.
Pulmonary rehabilitation interrupts this downward spiral of decline. Participants learn to cope better with
their breathlessness through repeated exposure to exercise-induced breathlessness in a “safe” healthcare
setting, with profound effects on the affective components of breathlessness [18, 19]. The brain
mechanisms underlying this have yet to be investigated. We hypothesised that an important effect of
pulmonary rehabilitation would be to reduce learned negative associations with breathlessness-related cues
(i.e. a reduction in “over-perception”). This would be reflected in reduced activation in the stimulus
valuation network. Extending this hypothesis, we predicted that those subjects with the strongest learned
associations might have the most to gain from pulmonary rehabilitation.
We therefore assessed brain activity associated with breathlessness-related word cues in a group of patients
with COPD before and after a course of pulmonary rehabilitation. Using functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI), we measured the brain’s response to a validated set of breathlessness-related word cues
[20] in combination with detailed clinical and psychological characterisation.
Methods
A brief overview of the study methods is provided here. For full details, see the supplementary material.
Comparison of pre-rehabilitation fMRI findings with healthy controls and development of the
breathlessness-cue task have been published elsewhere [20, 21].
Participants
31 people with mild to moderate COPD (median (interquartile range) Global Initiative for Chronic
Obstructive Lung Disease stage 2 (1–2), 21 male, mean±SD age 68±9 years) were studied immediately
preceding and following a 6-week course of outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation. All participants gave
written, informed consent and the Oxfordshire Research Ethics Committee A approved the study.

 Behavioural and physiological measurements and analysis
Self-report questionnaires
The following self-report questionnaires were completed and scored according to their respective manuals:
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) [22], State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [23],
Fatigue Severity Scale [24], St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) [25], Medical Research Council
(MRC) breathlessness scale [26], Dyspnoea-12 (D12) questionnaire [27], Catastrophic Thinking Scale in
Asthma (modified by substituting the word “breathlessness” for the word “asthma”) [28], Pain Awareness
and Vigilance Scale (modified by substituting the word “breathlessness” for the word “pain”) [29], and
Behavioural Inhibition System/Behavioural Activation System scale [30].
Physiology
Spirometry and an incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) were undertaken according to standard
practices [31].
Analysis
Full correlation matrices were calculated for all behavioural and physiological measures at baseline, and for
the change following pulmonary rehabilitation, using MATLAB version R2013a (Mathworks, Natick, MA,
USA). Partial correlation matrices were calculated on correlated variables, defined as p<0.05 (uncorrected).
The D12 score was taken as the clinical measure of breathlessness, and was compared with visual analogue
scale (VAS) breathlessness scores both prior to and across pulmonary rehabilitation. To explore whether
any of our measured behavioural variables were mediating these VAS–D12 relationships, we conducted a
mediation analysis using the CANlab mediation toolbox [32].

 Brain imaging and analysis
MRI was performed with a Siemens 3 T TIM-Trio scanner (Siemens, Camberley, Surrey, UK), using a
12-channel head coil. A structural T1-weighted scan (voxel size 1×1×1 mm), fMRI T2*-weighted scan
(voxel size 3×3×3 mm) and fieldmaps were collected. During fMRI scanning, participants were shown a
set of breathlessness-related word cues [20], and asked to rate each cue according to breathlessness and
breathlessness-anxiety on a VAS with the question “How breathless would this make you feel?” (wB) and
the “How anxious would this make you feel?” (wA). Word cues were chosen that were applicable to all
subjects. All subjects viewed the same set of words during both sessions, with the order of word
presentation randomised within each session.
A

of
matched
random-letter-string
presentations
was
interspersed
with
the
breathlessness cues. This allowed us to test whether any changes in mean VAS responses related to
generalised changes in negative valence or arousal, or were more breathlessness specific.
fMRI data processing was carried out within FSL (Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging of the Brain Software Library, Oxford, UK), using FEAT (fMRI Expert Analysis Tool version
5.98). The cluster Z threshold was 2.3 and the corrected cluster significance threshold p=0.05 [33].
Analysis was corrected for multiple comparisons across the whole brain; region-of-interest approaches
were not used.
The first-level (individual subject) analysis in FEAT incorporated a general linear model, with explanatory
variables included for word presentation, and two (de-meaned) explanatory variables modelling the
trial-by-trial variability in VAS responses to the breathlessness (wB) and breathlessness-anxiety (wA) cues

 presented during scanning. A middle-level analysis was then conducted to calculate a difference in brain
activity from pre- to post-rehabilitation for each subject.
The group-level analysis aimed to interrogate which brain regions could account for between-subject
variability in the VAS responses over the course of pulmonary rehabilitation. To do this, we regressed each
individual’s change in wB and wA VAS scores against the change in mean word-cue explanatory variable
from the middle-level analysis. We also conducted a secondary analysis, where we regressed the change in
VAS responses on pre-rehabilitation word-cue brain activity, to probe baseline factors associated with
improved breathlessness following pulmonary rehabilitation. Mediation analyses were also conducted on
the relationship between VAS score and correlated brain regions, with the behavioural questionnaire scores
as potential mediators, using the CANlab mediation toolbox [32].
Results
Participants
Demographic, physiological and questionnaire data, as well as averaged breathlessness VAS ratings, are
presented in tables 1 and 2. Improvement above the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in
quality of life (as measured by SGRQ [34]) occurred in 16 subjects (52%; MCID 4 points), functional
exercise capacity (as measured by ISWT [35]) in 19 subjects (61%; MCID –48 m) and clinical measures of
breathlessness (as measured by D12 [36]) in 14 subjects (45%; MCID 3 points).
Pulmonary rehabilitation led to a group mean±SD improvement in wA VAS responses (pre 40.5±19.4 versus
post 28.8±21.1; p=0.002, two-tailed paired t-test). As illustrated in figure 1, over the course of pulmonary
rehabilitation, in 24 patients wA decreased, in six patients wA increased and in one patient there was no
change. Improvements in wB VAS response did not reach statistical significance (pre 52.6±14.2 versus post
49.1±19.9; p=0.086 two-tailed paired t-test). Over the course of pulmonary rehabilitation, in 22 patients wB
decreased and in nine patients wB increased.

 Variability of response to pulmonary rehabilitation
Here, we present the findings of the longitudinal repeated measures analysis examining the changes in
neural responses and behaviour associated with changes in breathlessness-related word cues over the
course of pulmonary rehabilitation (figure 2).
“How breathless would this make you feel?” (wB)
Changes in wB ratings over the course of pulmonary rehabilitation were positively correlated with changes
in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activation in the left anterior insula, left posterior insula, left
supramarginal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex. We did not observe any significant activations in the
opposite direction.
“How anxious would this make you feel?” (wA)
Changes in wA ratings over the course of pulmonary rehabilitation were negatively correlated with
changes in BOLD activity in the posterior cingulate cortex, angular gyrus, primary motor cortex and
supramarginal gyrus. We did not observe any significant activations in the opposite direction.
Random letter strings
No changes in brain activity to random letter strings that correlated with changes in either wB or wA were
observed.
Behavioural changes with pulmonary rehabilitation
Exploratory full and partial correlation matrices of all behavioural scores are illustrated in figure 3.
Mediation analysis
A mediation analysis incorporated all variables [32] to investigate the relationship between changes in wA
and wB, and their relationship to change in D12 (our clinically validated measure). Change in wB was not

 correlated with D12, so mediation did not proceed further. The relationship between wA and D12 was
significantly mediated by change in depression, and the residuals (once depression was accounted for)
were nonsignificant (figure 4).
Baseline factors associated with improved breathlessness following pulmonary rehabilitation
Here, we present the findings of an analysis that examines how baseline brain activity correlates with
changes in the behavioural responses to breathlessness-related word cues over the course of pulmonary
rehabilitation (figure 5).
“How breathless would this make you feel?” (wB)
We observed a positive correlation between change in wB and pre-rehabilitation activity in the anterior
insula (bilateral), orbitofrontal cortex (bilateral), precuneus, lateral occipital cortex and primary motor
cortex (bilateral).
“How anxious would this make you feel?” (wA)
We observed a positive correlation between change in wA and pre-rehabilitation activity in the anterior
cingulate cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex.
Discussion
Key findings
Pulmonary rehabilitation was associated with improvements in breathlessness, exercise capacity and quality
of life, in line with previously published research [4, 6, 18, 19]. Changes in ratings of VAS breathlessness
(wB) positively correlated with changes in activity in the brain’s stimulus valuation network, whereas
changes in ratings of VAS breathlessness-anxiety (wA) negatively correlated with activity in attention-
regulating networks. At baseline, activity in the stimulus valuation network correlated with change in wB
and wA scores following pulmonary rehabilitation.
Effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on brain and behaviour
Group improvements were observed in a range of affective domains (table 2) that occurred independently
of any changes in spirometry [5]. However, not all participants showed clinically important improvements,
emphasising the need to understand the brain processes that are associated with pulmonary rehabilitation.
In chronic diseases such as COPD, prior experiences of symptoms can vastly alter outcomes and symptom
perception [37]. Learned associations between environmental cues and symptoms can influence this
symptom expectation and subsequent perception. We therefore used a word-cue task to probe these
associations. The changes in ratings of breathlessness-anxiety (wA) positively correlated with the changes
in the clinical measure of breathlessness (D12) across the course of rehabilitation (figure 4). This supports
previous work demonstrating that pulmonary rehabilitation has greater effects upon the affective
components of breathlessness [18, 19].
We then examined the changes in brain activity associated with word-cue presentation across pulmonary
rehabilitation. Changes in the ratings of breathlessness (wB) were positively correlated with changes in
brain activity in the anterior insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex and posterior
insular cortex. Taken together, these form key components of the stimulus valuation network, which is
responsible for the conscious awareness of the internal state of the body, or interoception [9]. These
observations may represent re-evaluated associations relating to breathlessness expectations.
The posterior insula plays a role in sensory-discriminative processing, with connectivity both to
somatosensory cortices and to the anterior insula to integrate sensory inputs with the stimulus valuation
network [9]. The positive correlation between changes in wB ratings and changes in BOLD activity seen in
this structure over the course of pulmonary rehabilitation suggests that the reappraisal of learned
associations may also influence lower-order sensory processing.
fMRI activity was negatively correlated with ratings of breathlessness-anxiety (wA) in the angular gyrus,
supramarginal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex. These changes in brain activity could represent a shift
in expectancy towards that seen in healthy controls [14, 21]. The angular gyrus and supramarginal gyrus
form a multimodal complex that integrates somatosensory inputs to the brain and is associated with
attention processing. The posterior cingulate cortex is thought to mediate interactions between emotions
and memory, controlling attentional focus [38]. All these functions are impaired by anxiety [39, 40].
Additionally, the increase in activity in the granular primary and pre-motor cortices may reflect a shift
towards more objective perceptual processing less dominated by learned associations [9, 14, 41].

 Baseline fMRI correlates with changes in VAS scores following pulmonary rehabilitation
Change in VAS responses over pulmonary rehabilitation was positively correlated with baseline BOLD
activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex in response to wA ratings
(figure 5), and in the anterior insula (bilateral), orbitofrontal cortex and motor cortex in response to wB
ratings. These areas comprise much of the stimulus valuation network. Our findings suggest that people
with greater brain activity during word-cue presentation are more likely to benefit from pulmonary
rehabilitation, particularly with regard to the wA contrast, as this correlates with the clinically validated
D12 score. Although tempting to dissect the specific brain areas relating to wA and wB in more detail, this
is best reserved for future studies where connectivity profiles might better explain the components of this
network function more comprehensively.
It is possible that the repeated episodes of breathlessness experienced in a “safe” setting during pulmonary
rehabilitation help to re-shape associations. These findings and interpretations are supported by a recent
behavioural study [42], which showed that higher breathlessness-fear before pulmonary rehabilitation was
associated with greater reductions in breathlessness during exercise following pulmonary rehabilitation.
Driving forces behind changes in behaviour
We also interrogated how the relationship between VAS scales and associated brain activity may be related
to other clinical and behavioural measures of breathlessness. The full correlation matrix (figure 3)
demonstrates that many of the behavioural measures are at least partially explained by each other. A
notable exception is spirometry, which is poorly explained by all of the other measures. This distinction
between lung function and the various measures of breathlessness perception adds to the weight of
evidence that the impact of COPD is poorly reflected by spirometry [3].
When investigating the VAS scores associated with the breathlessness expectancy task, the strongest
correlation with wA was the D12 questionnaire; a well-validated clinical measure of breathlessness [27]. In
addition, strong correlations exist between wA and breathlessness catastrophising and depression.
Conversely, the wB measure did not correlate significantly with any of the measures. Mediation analysis
[32] revealed that the relationship between wA and the D12 scale appears to be mediated by changes in
depression, and when this component is removed there is no remaining relationship between D12 and wA
(figure 4f). Although the direction of the relationship between anxiety, depression and breathlessness
remains unknown, many consider it to be bidirectional [17]. Some even speculate that aberrant predictions
mediated by the stimulus valuation network may drive depression, anxiety and fatigue [9].
Thus, based upon predictive models of sensory perception, we speculate that pulmonary rehabilitation
exerts its benefit by two broad mechanisms in the brain: 1) by updating of the brain’s set of
breathlessness-related priors (through associative learning), and 2) by acting upon measures of negative
affect that act as moderators of priors and influence gain of sensory information processing. Improvements
in muscle function with fitness would additionally adjust afferent inputs [4]. These factors are likely to
work together to contribute to the well-documented improvements in well-being with pulmonary
rehabilitation [4, 19, 42].
Further considerations
Although some of the brain regions identified in the present study overlap with brain regions activated by
induced breathlessness, it is important to note that this does not necessarily implicate activity in identical
neuronal populations or networks. A single MRI voxel may contain over half a million neurons, not all of
which would activate simultaneously. Future work could also explore connectivity profiles, or functional
communication between different areas of the brain, which may differ across perceptions even with similar
task activation patterns.
Although it is possible that changes in ratings of breathlessness (wB) and breathlessness-anxiety (wA) may
be influenced by a generalised changes in negative valence, arousal or attention, the fact that we observed
no changes in brain activity correlated with wB and wA during the random-letter-string control task
suggests that this unlikely to be a major confound.
The current study used a parametric design, investigating changes in brain activity that correlated with
individual subject’s VAS scores of wA and wB. With the range of responses to pulmonary rehabilitation,
future work could look to more formally compare responders with nonresponders, but this would require
considerably larger sample sizes.
We did not include a control group of COPD subjects who either did not undertake pulmonary
rehabilitation treatment or received a sham treatment. Without a control group, potential contributing
factors (such as placebo effects and natural fluctuations in disease severity) cannot be disentangled from
the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation. However, our primary question was to understand the brain

 mechanisms underlying subject-specific changes in breathlessness perception. Future work may wish to
include a control group, to better understand group-wide effects of rehabilitation compared with control
or sham-treated subjects. Importantly, the clinical changes we have observed are very much in line with
clinical reports of pulmonary rehabilitation (e.g. the UK National Pulmonary Rehabilitation Audit [6]),
suggesting we have studied a representative sample of individuals.
Clinical relevance
This study examined brain mechanisms underlying the variable changes in breathlessness over a course of
pulmonary rehabilitation. We have shown that changes in breathlessness ratings are positively correlated
with
changes
in
activity
in
the
stimulus
valuation
network,
and
changes
in
ratings
of
breathlessness-anxiety are negatively correlated with activity in attention processing and motor control
areas of the brain. We have also demonstrated that changes in ratings of breathlessness-anxiety correspond
with a clinically meaningful measure of breathlessness, the D12 questionnaire. Therefore, specifically
targeting associative learning might be a way to further improve efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation. This
might arise from combining pulmonary rehabilitation with drugs that target relevant neurotransmitter
systems [43]. As many patients decline the invitation to pulmonary rehabilitation, alternative behavioural
therapies could be developed to focus on re-evaluating the interpretation of respiratory sensations, such as
through breathing exercises or mindfulness [44].
Our findings also demonstrate the first steps towards using fMRI as a tool for patient stratification. We
speculate that this is most likely to be achieved in real life by using a detailed understanding of neural
mechanisms to guide the development of appropriate behavioural tests (questionnaires, computerised
tasks) that can be used at the bedside. These tests could be incorporated with appropriate clinical measures
to personalise the treatment of COPD, targeting treatment options where they are needed in each
individual.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that changes in ratings of breathlessness and breathlessness-anxiety
over the course of pulmonary rehabilitation likely reflect changes in associative learning. Our findings
suggest that changes in the brain responses to breathlessness-related word cues over the course of
pulmonary
rehabilitation
become
less
dependent
upon
learned
associations,
thus
reducing
“over-perception” of symptoms. Understanding the neural processing of breathlessness in a clinical
population is crucial for advances to be made in its treatment, such as the development of patient
stratification, leading to individualised treatments that may target breathlessness independently of disease
mechanisms.
