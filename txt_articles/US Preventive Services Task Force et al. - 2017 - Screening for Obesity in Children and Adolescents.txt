 Screening for Obesity in Children and Adolescents
US Preventive Services Task Force
Recommendation Statement
US Preventive Services Task Force
IMPORTANCE Based on year 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts,
approximately 17% of children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years in the United States have
obesity, and almost 32% of children and adolescents are overweight or have obesity. Obesity
in children and adolescents is associated with morbidity such as mental health and
psychological issues, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, orthopedic problems, and adverse
cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes (eg, high blood pressure, abnormal lipid levels, and
insulin resistance). Children and adolescents may also experience teasing and bullying
behaviors based on their weight. Obesity in childhood and adolescence may continue into
adulthood and lead to adverse cardiovascular outcomes or other obesity-related morbidity,
such as type 2 diabetes.
SUBPOPULATION CONSIDERATIONS Although the overall rate of child and adolescent obesity
has stabilized over the last decade after increasing steadily for 3 decades, obesity rates
continue to increase in certain populations, such as African American girls and Hispanic boys.
These racial/ethnic differences in obesity prevalence are likely a result of both genetic and
nongenetic factors (eg, socioeconomic status, intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and fast
food, and having a television in the bedroom).
OBJECTIVE To update the 2010 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
recommendation on screening for obesity in children 6 years and older.
EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for obesity in children
and adolescents and the benefits and harms of weight management interventions.
FINDINGS Comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions (�26 contact hours) in children
and adolescents 6 years and older who have obesity can result in improvements in weight
status for up to 12 months; there is inadequate evidence regarding the effectiveness of less
intensive interventions. The harms of behavioral interventions can be bounded as small
to none, and the harms of screening are minimal. Therefore, the USPSTF concluded with
moderate certainty that screening for obesity in children and adolescents 6 years and older
is of moderate net benefit.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen
for obesity in children and adolescents 6 years and older and offer or refer them
to comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions to promote improvements
in weight status. (B recommendation)

Summary of Recommendation and Evidence
The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for obesity in chil-
dren and adolescents 6 years and older and offer or refer them to
comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions to promote im-
provements in weight status (B recommendation) (Figure 1).
Rationale
Importance
Approximately 17% of children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years
in the United States have obesity (defined as an age- and sex-
specific body mass index [BMI] in the 95th percentile or greater,
based on year 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[CDC] growth charts).1-4 Almost 32% of children and adolescents
are overweight (defined as an age- and sex-specific BMI in the
85th to 94th percentile) or have obesity.2,3 Although the overall
rate of child and adolescent obesity has stabilized over the last
decade after increasing steadily for 3 decades, obesity rates con-
tinue to increase in certain populations, such as African American
girls and Hispanic boys.4,5 The proportion of children who meet
the criteria for severe obesity (class II [�120% of the 95th per-
centile] or class III [140% of the 95th percentile]) also continues
to increase.6
Obesity in children and adolescents is associated with morbid-
ity such as mental health and psychological issues, asthma,
obstructive sleep apnea, orthopedic problems, and adverse cardio-
vascular and metabolic outcomes (eg, high blood pressure, abnor-
mal lipid levels, and insulin resistance). Children and adolescents
also may experience teasing and bullying behaviors based on their
weight. Obesity in childhood and adolescence may continue into
adulthood and lead to adverse cardiovascular outcomes or other
obesity-related morbidity, such as type 2 diabetes.3
Detection
In 2005, the USPSTF found that age- and sex-adjusted BMI
(calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height
in meters) percentile is the accepted measure for detecting over-
weight or obesity in children and adolescents because it is fea-
sible for use in primary care, a reliable measure, and associated
with adult obesity.7-9
Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment or Intervention
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening and inten-
sive behavioral interventions for obesity in children and adoles-
cents 6 years and older can lead to improvements in weight status.
The magnitude of this benefit is moderate.

Clinical Considerations
Patient Population Under Consideration
This recommendation applies to children and adolescents 6 years
and older (Figure 2).
Assessment of Risk
Although all children and adolescents are at risk for obesity and
should be screened, there are several specific risk factors, includ-
ing parental obesity, poor nutrition, low levels of physical activity,
inadequate sleep, sedentary behaviors, and low family income.3
Risk factors associated with obesity in younger children in-
cludematernaldiabetes,maternalsmoking,gestationalweightgain,
andrapidinfantgrowth.Adecreaseinphysicalactivityinyoungchil-
dren is a risk factor for obesity later in adolescence. Obesity rates
continue to increase in some racial/ethnic minority populations.
These racial/ethnic differences in obesity prevalence are likely a re-
sultofbothgeneticandnongeneticfactors(eg,socioeconomicsta-
tus, intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and fast food, and hav-
ing a television in the bedroom).3 The prevalence of obesity is
approximately 21% to 25% among African American and Hispanic
children 6 years and older.2,3 In contrast, the prevalence of obesity
ranges from 3.7% among Asian girls aged 6 to 11 years to 20.9%
among non-Hispanic white adolescent girls.2,3
Screening Tests
Body mass index measurement is the recommended screening
test for obesity. Body mass index percentile is plotted on growth

demonstrated greater weight loss and some improvements in

of multiple components.3,4 Although these components varied

Discourage the use of this service.
I statement
The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits
and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of
benefits and harms cannot be determined.
Read the Clinical Considerations section
of the USPSTF Recommendation
Statement. If the service is offered,
patients should understand the
uncertainty about the balance of benefits
and harms.
USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit
Level of Certainty
Description
High
The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care
populations. These studies assess the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes. This conclusion is therefore unlikely to be
strongly affected by the results of future studies.
Moderate
The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate
is constrained by such factors as 
the number, size, or quality of individual studies.
inconsistency of findings across individual studies.
limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice.
lack of coherence in the chain of evidence.
As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large
enough to alter the conclusion.
The USPSTF defines certainty as “likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct.” The net benefit is defined as
benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature
of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.
Low
The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of
the limited number or size of studies.
important flaws in study design or methods.
inconsistency of findings across individual studies.
gaps in the chain of evidence.
findings not generalizable to routine primary care practice.
lack of information on important health outcomes.
More information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes.

tempting foods and limiting screen time), goal setting, self-
monitoring, contingent rewards, and problem solving; and
included supervised physical activity sessions. Intensive interven-
tions involving 52 or more contact hours rarely took place in pri-
mary care settings but rather in settings to which primary care cli-
nicians could refer patients. These types of interventions were
often delivered by multidisciplinary teams, including pediatri-
cians, exercise physiologists or physical therapists, dietitians or
diet assistants, psychologists or social workers, or other behav-

All children and adolescents are at risk for obesity and should be screened; specific risk factors include parental obesity, poor nutrition,
low levels of physical activity, inadequate sleep, sedentary behaviors, and low family income. 
BMI measurement, using height and weight, is the recommended screening test for obesity. Obesity is defined as an age- and
sex-specific BMI in the 95th percentile or greater.
Comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions of ≥26 contact hours resulted in weight loss. Effective interventions consisted
of multiple components, including: sessions targeting both the parent and child (separately, together, or both); offering individual
sessions (both family and group); providing information about healthy eating, safe exercising, and reading food labels; encouraging
the use of stimulus control (eg, limiting access to tempting foods and screen time), goal setting, self-monitoring, contingent rewards,
and problem solving; and supervised physical activity sessions. Providers included primary care clinicians, exercise physiologists,
physical therapists, dietitians, diet assistants, psychologists, and social workers, but the more intensive interventions usually
involved referral outside the primary care office. Evidence regarding pharmacotherapy interventions was inadequate.
The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of screening for obesity in children and adolescents 6 y and
older and offering or referring them to comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions to promote improvements in weight status
is moderate.
The USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for primary hypertension and lipid disorders in children and adolescents.

 Adherence to interventions can change their effectiveness. In
the included trials, 68% to 95% of participants completed all of
the sessions.3 Lower adherence in clinical practice could decrease
the overall benefit of these interventions.
Metformin has been used for weight loss in children but is not
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this pur-
pose. Metformin has a small effect on weight (BMI reduction <1),
and this effect is of uncertain clinical significance. Although the
harms of metformin use are probably small, evidence regarding
long-term outcomes of its use is lacking. In addition, participants
in the metformin trials had abnormal insulin or glucose metabo-
lism, and most had severe obesity. This limits the applicability of
the results to a general pediatric population with obesity. Orlistat
is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in
adolescents 12 years and older. However, orlistat also has a small
effect on weight (BMI reduction <1), and this effect is of uncertain
clinical significance. In addition, orlistat is associated with moder-
ate harms. Therefore, the USPSTF encourages clinicians to pro-
mote behavioral interventions as the primary effective interven-
tion for weight loss in children and adolescents.
Clinically Important Weight Loss
Research studies use a standardized measure (z score) of BMI.
This measure helps compare results among children of different
ages and over time as children grow. A few observational studies
have addressed the question of what change in BMI z score or
excess weight represents a clinically important change. These
studies showed that a BMI z score reduction of 0.15 to 0.25 is
associated with improvements in cardiovascular and metabolic
risk factors.3,4 A German expert panel determined that a BMI
z score reduction of 0.20 is clinically significant and is comparable
to a weight loss of approximately 5%.11 A BMI z score reduction in
the range of 0.20 to 0.25 appears to be a suitable threshold for
clinically important change.3
An analysis by Epstein et al of 10-year outcomes from 4 ran-
domized clinical trials of family-based behavioral obesity treat-
ment programs suggested an association between weight loss
in childhood and decreased risk of obesity in early adulthood.
Participants were aged 8 to 12 years at baseline (mean age, 10.4
years), and average age at follow-up was 20 years.3,12,13 Almost all
participants (about 85%) had obesity at baseline. The compre-
hensive behavioral interventions involved 30 or more contact
hours with the families. Among children with obesity, 52% contin-
ued to have obesity as adults.3,12,13 In contrast, naturalistic longi-
tudinal studies with similar follow-up report obesity rates of 64%
to 87% among adults who had obesity as children; US-based
studies were often at the upper end of the range.9,14-16
Additional Approaches to Prevention
The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends
behavioral interventions to reduce sedentary screen time among
children 13 years and younger.17 It found insufficient evidence to
recommend school-based obesity programs to prevent or reduce
overweight and obesity among children and adolescents.18
The CDC recommends 26 separate community strategies to
prevent obesity, such as promoting breastfeeding, promoting
access to affordable healthy food and beverages, promoting
healthy food and beverage choices, and fostering physical activity
among children.19
Useful Resources
In a separate recommendation, the USPSTF concluded that there
is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms
ofscreeningforprimaryhypertensioninasymptomaticchildrenand
adolescentstopreventsubsequentcardiovasculardiseaseinchild-
hood or adulthood (I statement).20 The USPSTF has also con-
cluded that there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of
benefits and harms of screening for lipid disorders in children and
adolescents (I statement).21
Other Considerations
Research Needs and Gaps
The USPSTF identified several areas in need of further research.
Trials evaluating the direct benefit and harms of screening for obe-
sity in children and adolescents are needed. One such trial could
implement a systematic screening and treatment program in 1 set
of clinics and providers and continue with usual care in a separate
set of clinics and providers. Reproducing existing effective inter-
ventions and conducting full trials of small feasibility studies are
necessary next steps. Further investigations to determine the spe-
cific effective components of behavioral interventions are needed.
Long-term follow-up of participants after completion of treatment
is needed to confirm maintenance of weight loss and to assess
long-term benefits and harms. More studies are needed that
address behavioral interventions in diverse populations and
younger children (age �5 years). Also, more evidence is needed
about what constitutes clinically important health benefits and the
amount of weight loss associated with those health benefits.
The quality of study methods and reporting in recent studies
is much better than in the earlier literature; however, the field
would benefit further from improved consistency in how health
outcomes are reported. Individual-patient meta-analysis could
be beneficial in helping understand the differences between
patients who lose weight and those who do not. Efficacy and
safety trials of weight loss medications for pediatric populations
with obesity are needed.
Discussion
Burden of Disease
Recent prevalence figures from 2011 to 2012 indicate that 17% of
children and adolescents aged 2 to 18 years in the United States
have obesity.2 Children and adolescents aged 6 to 19 years are
more likely to have obesity than children aged 2 to 5 years.2,3
Although overt cardiovascular disease can take many years to
develop, obesity is associated with poor cardiovascular and meta-
bolic outcomes during childhood (eg, high blood pressure, abnor-
mal lipid levels, and insulin resistance). In addition, conditions such
as asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, orthopedic problems, early

 maturation, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and hepatic steatosis are
associated with childhood and adolescent obesity. Children may
experience low self-esteem, impaired quality of life, and teasing
and bullying behaviors based on their weight.3
Obesity can have short-term effects on the health of children
andadolescents.Inaddition,obesityinchildhoodandadolescence

80% of adolescents with obesity will have obesity as adults (70%
when BMI is measured at age �30 years).3,14 Approximately 64%
of preadolescents with obesity also had obesity as adults. Meta-
analyses have shown a strong association between childhood and
adultobesity;childrenwithobesityareabout5timesmorelikelyto

Scope of Review
TheUSPSTFexaminedtheevidenceonscreeningforobesityinchil-
dren and adolescents and the benefits and harms of weight man-
agement interventions. Bariatric surgery, which is limited to pa-
tients with morbid obesity, and obesity prevention interventions
amongchildrenofnormalweightwereconsideredtobeoutsidethe
scope of this review.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
The USPSTF previously found evidence that BMI is an adequate
screening measure for identifying children and adolescents with
obesity.7-9
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Interventions
The USPSTF found no direct evidence addressing the benefits of
screening for obesity in children and adolescents to improve
intermediate or health outcomes. Estimated time of contact
was the only behavioral intervention component associated
with effect size (P < .001).3,4 The USPSTF found no evidence for
or against the importance of any other specific intervention
component.3 Subgroup analysis of prespecified populations
(ie, age, race/ethnicity, sex, degree of excess weight, socioeco-
nomic status) was sparsely reported in trials, resulting in an inabil-
ity to draw any conclusions about differential effectiveness on
weight outcomes.3 The USPSTF did not find sufficient evidence
on screening in children younger than 6 years. Effective behav-
ioral interventions were targeted at children 6 years and older.3
Evidence on effective interventions in children younger than 6
years is limited.
Behavioral Interventions
The USPSTF reviewed 45 trials (n = 7099) of behavioral interven-
tions for obesity. Of these, 42 trials (n = 6956) used multicompo-
nent interventions targeting lifestyle change (eg, counseling on
diet, increasing physical activity or decreasing sedentary behavior,
and addressing behavior change) to limit weight gain or decrease
weight. Three smaller trials assessed different behavioral
approaches (weight loss maintenance, regulation of cues for over-
eating, and interpersonal therapy).3
Of the 42 behavioral intervention trials (n = 6956), 8 were
good quality and 34 were fair quality. Half of the trials were con-
ducted in the United States; the rest were conducted in Europe,
Israel, or Australia.3 Forty-three percent of trials were conducted
in primary care settings and 43% in another health care setting.
The remaining trials were conducted outside of a health care
setting. Trials included children and adolescents aged 2 to 19
years; almost half of the trials were limited to elementary school–
aged children (6 to 8 years, up to 12 years).3 Slightly more than
half of the participants were girls. Most trials did not report on
race/ethnicity or included predominantly white participants.
Trials included children with obesity only or both children with
overweight and children with obesity.3 Average baseline BMI was
18.7 in trials of preschool-aged children, 23.5 in trials of elementary
school–aged children, and 32.2 in trials of adolescents. Time of
contact in the interventions ranged from 0.25 to 122 hours
(over 1 to 122 sessions); 7 studies had 52 contact hours or more,
9 studies had 26 to 51 contact hours, 11 studies had 6 to 25
contact hours, and 15 studies had 15 contact hours or less.3 Ses-
sions took place over 2.25 to 24 months. Data on follow-up
beyond 1 year were limited. Trials with minimal contact time
(�5 hours) were often conducted in primary care settings and
involved individual sessions.
All of the effective behavioral interventions included parents
and delivered basic instructive information about healthy nutri-
tion and physical activity. Additional components of the most
effective interventions included being conducted in a specialty
setting; targeting both children and their parents; helping parents
and children engage in stimulus control (eg, limiting access to
tempting foods and limiting screen time); and assisting partici-
pants in identifying goals, self-monitoring, and problem solving to
accomplish their selected goals. Trials with 52 contact hours or
more often included supervised physical activity sessions, as did
approximately half of the trials with 26 to 51 contact hours.3
Other common components included contingent use of rewards
or reinforcement, motivational interviewing, teaching of coping
skills, addressing body image, and the option of individual-family
counseling to address family-specific issues. All of the effective
studies emphasized eating healthy foods and using moderate
portions.3
All 7 trials with 52 contact hours or more demonstrated
benefits of treatment, with a pooled standardized mean differ-
ence in change of −1.10 (95% CI, −1.30 to −0.89; I2 = 43%)
(1 study did not have adequate data to pool). Nine trials with 26
to 51 contact hours showed smaller effects, with a pooled stan-
dardized mean difference in change of −0.34 (95% CI, −0.52 to
−0.16; I2 = 24%).3 Among the more intensive trials (�26 contact
hours), intervention groups showed absolute reductions in BMI
z score (a standardized measure of BMI based on age- and sex-
specific norms to facilitate comparison across ages) of 0.20 or
greater. Most participants maintained their baseline weight
within 5 lb while growing in height. In comparison, control groups
showed small increases or reductions in BMI z score of less than
0.10 or weight gain of 5 to 17 lb (Table 2).3 Interventions were
effective in reducing excess weight in children and adolescents
after 6 to 12 months. Across all categories of intervention inten-
sity, children in both the intervention and control groups showed
a broad range of effects. Some participants had large reductions
in weight, some showed no or modest changes, and some contin-
ued to gain weight.3 Very limited evidence suggests that briefer
interventions may be effective in children with overweight only.
Only 3 of the 24 trials with less than 26 contact hours showed

 statistically significant benefits of treatment. Two of the 3 studies
were among children with overweight but not obesity.3 Standard-
ized effect sizes were typically small (absolute BMI z score reduc-
tion �0.10 in intervention groups). Although the effects in the
less intensive trials were seldom statistically significant, interven-
tion groups frequently showed greater average reductions in
excess weight than control groups.3
Cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors were consistently
reported in studies with 52 contact hours or more. Pooled re-
ductions in systolic blood pressure (6 studies; pooled mean
difference in change between groups, −6.4 mm Hg [95% CI,
−8.6 to −4.2]; I2 = 51%) and diastolic blood pressure (6 studies;
pooled mean difference in change between groups, −4.0 mm Hg
[95% CI, −5.6 to −2.5]; I2 = 17%) were statistically significant.3
Pooled results did not demonstrate statistically significant
improvements in lipid or fasting plasma glucose levels but
some improvements in insulin or glucose measures. Cardiovascu-
lar and metabolic risk factors were reported less frequently in
trials with fewer contact hours, and pooled results were not asso-

lin or glucose levels.3
Eleven trials (n = 1523) of behavioral interventions reported
on quality of life or functioning, self-esteem, body satisfaction,
and depression outcomes. Trial results mostly demonstrated
small, statistically insignificant increases in quality-of-life scores.3
Five of these trials reported on self-esteem outcomes, and 5
reported on body satisfaction outcomes; no group differences
were found.3 One trial reported no group differences in the per-
centage of participants screening positive for depression. No
trials reported on other health outcomes, such as morbidity asso-
ciated with type 2 diabetes or hypertension, orthopedic pain,
sleep apnea, or adult obesity.3
Theremaining3smalltrials,whicheitherdidnotconsistofmul-
tiplecomponentsortargetedweightlossmaintenance,didnotfind
benefit.3 The small weight maintenance trial (n = 61) found no be-
tween-group differences in body weight, body composition, glu-
cose or insulin levels, or lipid levels. Two small pilot trials (n = 82)
that targeted overeating used regulation of cues for overeating or
interpersonal therapy approaches and found no group differences
in BMI z score or BMI.3
Pharmacotherapy Interventions
Metformin and orlistat are associated with small reductions in ex-
cess weight (BMI reduction <1 [about 5 to 7 lb]) compared with pla-
cebo, and both have mild to moderate gastrointestinal adverse ef-
fects, which, when considered collectively, provide small or no
benefit on health outcomes.
Eleven trials (n = 1395) examined the benefits of pharmaco-
therapy interventions compared with placebo. Ten of these trials
were fair quality, and the remaining trial was good quality. A little
more than one-half of the trials focused on adolescents only; the
rest included younger children. Approximately two-thirds of
the participants were girls.3 None of the trials were conducted in
a primary care setting; rather, trials took place in pediatric obesity,
endocrine, or research clinics. Trials were conducted in the United
States (64%), the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany,
and Switzerland. Among trials that reported race/ethnicity, 25%
to 89% of participants were white. Most pharmacotherapy trials
only followed up participants for 6 months.3 Only 1 trial assessed
the effects of pharmacotherapy after discontinuation.
The average baseline BMI in the pharmacotherapy interven-
tion trials (36.0 vs 37.4 in metformin and orlistat trials, respec-
tively) was higher than in the behavioral intervention trials. Adher-
ence was reported inconsistently.3 All but 1 pharmacotherapy trial
includedbehavioralinterventions,while3trialsofferedgroupphysi-
cal activity sessions; none involved primary care clinicians. Metfor-
mindosagerangedfrom1to2g/d;orlistatdosagewas360mg/din
all 3 trials.3
Metformin | One good-quality and 7 fair-quality trials (n = 616)
showed small effect sizes on weight reduction in intervention
groups compared with placebo. Pooled results from 6 studies
showed a reduction in BMI z score of −0.10 (95% CI, −0.17
to −0.03; I2 = 13%) and a reduction in BMI of −0.86 (95% CI,
−1.44 to −0.29; I2 = 0%). All participants had abnormal insulin
or glucose metabolism.3 Most participants also met adult criteria
for severe obesity. Trials showed no benefit on blood pressure
or lipid levels and a small benefit on insulin or glucose levels.
No metformin trials reported health outcomes.3 One trial demon-
strated that the effect of metformin dissipates after 12 to 24
weeks of discontinuation.3

 Orlistat | Three fair-quality trials (n = 779) showed small reductions
in excess weight in intervention groups compared with placebo.
Orlistat was associated with small reductions in BMI ranging from
−0.94 (95% CI, −1.58 to −0.30) to −0.50 (95% CI, −7.62 to 6.62)
and weight ranging from −3.90 kg (95% CI, −25.54 to 17.74) to
−2.61 kg (95% CI not reported; P < .001).3 The 1 trial reporting BMI
z score showed a between-group difference of −0.06 (95% CI,
−0.12 to 0.00). Most studies found no benefits on cardiovascular
and metabolic risk factors, except for a reduction in diastolic blood
pressure levels in 1 trial (mean difference in change, −1.81 mm Hg
[95% CI not reported]; P = .04). One trial reported quality-of-life
measures and found no differences between intervention and pla-
cebo groups at 6 months.3
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
or Interventions
The USPSTF found no direct evidence addressing the harms of
screening for obesity in children and adolescents.
Behavioral Interventions
Ten trials (n = 1232) examined the harms of behavioral interven-
tions. Four trials were good quality and 6 were fair quality. Five
trials found no adverse or serious adverse events in the interven-
tion group. Five trials found no group differences in disordered
eating or body dissatisfaction.3
Pharmacotherapy Interventions
Fourteen trials (n = 1484) examined the adverse effects of phar-
macotherapy.
Metformin | Eleven trials (n = 705) examined the harms of metfor-
min.Tentrialswerefairquality,andtheremainingtrialwasgoodqual-
ity. Gastrointestinal adverse effects (eg, nausea, vomiting, or diar-
rhea) were common in both the intervention and placebo groups
butnotserious.Vomiting,forexample,wasreportedby15%to42%
ofparticipantstakingmetforminin2trialsandby3%to21%ofcon-
trolgroupparticipants.3Ratesofdiscontinuationduetoadverseef-
fects were 3.8% in the metformin groups and 3.2% in the placebo
groups. Trials showed no differences in kidney or liver function.
No cases of lactic acidosis were reported.3
Orlistat | Three fair-quality trials (n = 779) found that gastrointesti-
nal adverse effects were more common in the intervention groups
than in the placebo groups.3 Gastrointestinal adverse effects were
common among patients taking orlistat. Fatty or oily stools were
reported by 50% to 70% of participants taking orlistat and 0% to
8% of those taking placebo, and uncontrolled passage of stool or
oil was reported by 60% of participants taking orlistat and 11% of
those taking placebo.3 Abdominal pain or cramping were reported
by 16% to 65% of participants taking orlistat and 11% to 26%
of those taking placebo; flatus with discharge was reported by
20% to 43% of those taking orlistat and 3% to 11% of those taking
placebo; and fecal incontinence was reported by 9% to 10% of
those taking orlistat and 0% to 1% of those taking placebo.3
One possibly related serious adverse event (cholecystectomy)
was reported in a participant who lost 15.8 kg. Rates of discontinua-
tion due to adverse effects were twice as common in the interven-
tion group as in the placebo group (3.2% vs 1.7%, respectively).3
However, prescribing data from the United Kingdom show that
rates of orlistat discontinuation among adolescents are about 50%
after 1 month.22
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF previously found adequate evidence that BMI is an ac-
ceptablemeasureforscreeningforexcessweightinchildrenandado-
lescents. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that comprehen-
sive,intensivebehavioralinterventionsinchildrenandadolescents
6 years and older who have obesity can result in improvements in
weightstatusforupto12months.Itfoundinadequateevidencere-
gardingtheeffectivenessoflessintensiveinterventions.TheUSPSTF
found adequate evidence to bound the harms of behavioral inter-
ventions as small to none and judged the harms of screening to be
minimal. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate cer-
taintythatscreeningforobesityinchildrenandadolescents6years
and older is of moderate net benefit.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Genetics and various environmental factors play important roles in
the development of obesity. Once obesity has developed, an indi-
vidual’
s biochemical feedback mechanisms work to sustain the
body’
s weight gain.23 Changes in neuronal signaling decrease sati-
ety and perceptions of the amount of food eaten.24 As a result,
weight loss can be challenging. Prospective data suggest that car-
diovascularriskfactorsamongadultswithoutobesityaresimilarbe-
tweenthosewhohadobesityaschildrenandthosewhodidnot.3,25
This suggests that adverse cardiovascular effects in childhood may
be reversible with weight loss. This is of particular importance be-
causeobesityinchildhoodandadolescencemaycontinueintoadult-
hood and lead to poor health outcomes.
Response to Public Comment

public comment on the USPSTF website from November 1 to
November 28, 2016. Many comments asked about the compo-
nentsofeffectiveinterventions.Inresponse,theUSPSTFaddedlan-
guageinthe“EffectivenessofEarlyDetectionandInterventions”sec-

 well as medical and behavioral risk factors for obesity.26 The
American Academy of Pediatrics endorsed these recommenda-
tions and further recommends annually plotting BMI on a growth
chart for all patients 2 years and older.27 In 2011, a National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute expert panel recommended using BMI
to screen for obesity in children and adolescents aged 2 to 21
years at high risk for obesity (ie, due to history of parental obesity,
excessive gain in BMI, or change in physical activity).28 In 2015,
the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health recommended
growth monitoring for all children and adolescents 17 years and
younger at all appropriate primary care visits. It also recommends
that primary care clinicians offer or refer children and adolescents
with overweight or obesity to structured behavioral interventions
aimed at healthy weight management.29
The National Academies Health and Medicine Division (for-
merly the Institute of Medicine) recommends that clinicians mea-
sure weight and length or height at every well-child visit using
World Health Organization (0 to 23 months) or CDC (24 to 59
months) growth charts.30 The National Association of Pediatric
Nurse Practitioners recommends assessing height and weight para-
meters, including height to weight ratio, in children younger than 2
years and BMI in children 2 years and older.31
