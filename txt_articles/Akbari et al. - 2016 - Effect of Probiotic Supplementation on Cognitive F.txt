Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with severe cognitive impairments as well as
some metabolic defects. Scant studies in animal models indicate a link between
probiotics and cognitive function. This randomized, double-blind, and controlled
clinical trial was conducted among 60 AD patients to assess the effects of probiotic
supplementation on cognitive function and metabolic status. The patients were randomly
divided into two groups (n = 30 in each group) treating with either milk (control
group) or a mixture of probiotics (probiotic group). The probiotic supplemented group
took 200 ml/day probiotic milk containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus
casei, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Lactobacillus fermentum (2 × 109 CFU/g for
each) for 12 weeks. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score was recorded
in all subjects before and after the treatment. Pre- and post-treatment fasting
blood samples were obtained to determine the related markers. After 12 weeks
intervention, compared with the control group (−5.03% ± 3.00), the probiotic treated
(+27.90% ± 8.07) patients showed a significant improvement in the MMSE score
(P < 0.001). In addition, changes in plasma malondialdehyde (−22.01% ± 4.84
vs. +2.67% ± 3.86 µmol/L, P < 0.001), serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
(−17.61% ± 3.70 vs. +45.26% ± 3.50 µg/mL, P < 0.001), homeostasis model of
assessment-estimated insulin resistance (+28.84% ± 13.34 vs. +76.95% ± 24.60,
P = 0.002), Beta cell function (+3.45% ± 10.91 vs. +75.62% ± 23.18, P = 0.001),
serum triglycerides (−20.29% ± 4.49 vs. −0.16% ± 5.24 mg/dL, P = 0.003), and
quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (−1.83 ± 1.26 vs. −4.66 ± 1.70, P = 0.006)
in the probiotic group were significantly varied compared to the control group. We
found that the probiotic treatment had no considerable effect on other biomarkers of
oxidative stress and inflammation, fasting plasma glucose, and other lipid profiles. Overall,
the current study demonstrated that probiotic consumption for 12 weeks positively
affects cognitive function and some metabolic statuses in the AD patients. Clinical Trial

Probiotic and Alzheimer’s Disease
BACKGROUND
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is recognized as one of the most
common forms of senile dementia (Qiu et al., 2007). AD
begins with memory loss of recent events (short-term memory
impairment) and finally robs the patients of their sense
of self (Amemori et al., 2015). Early onset of the disease,
older age, low education level, and several poor health
conditions affect the prevalence rate of the disease and the
degree of cognitive impairment (de Souza-Talarico et al.,
2016). Increased biomarkers of oxidative stress (Furman
et al., 2016), inflammation and chronic neuroinflammation
are reported to be associated with many neurodegenerative
disorders of central nervous system (CNS) including AD
(Leszek et al., 2016). Furthermore, previous studies have
demonstrated
that
metabolic
alterations
such
as
insulin
resistance
(Arrieta-Cruz
and
Gutierrez-Juarez,
2016),
hyperglycemia
(Arrieta-Cruz
and
Gutierrez-Juarez,
2016),
and dyslipidemia (Presecki et al., 2011) are associated with
the
pathogenesis
and
development
of
AD.
Experimental
evidence
indicates
that
alterations
in
micronutrients
are
also among the risk factors for AD (Taghizadeh et al.,
2014).
The microbiota is a dynamic ecosystem which is influenced
by several factors including genetics, diet, metabolism, age,
geography, antibiotic treatment, and stress (Hufeldt et al.,
2010; Cho et al., 2012; Drago et al., 2012). Recent evidence
indicates a clear association between changes in the microbiota
and cognitive behaviors (Gareau, 2014). In addition, animal
studies imply on the necessity of an optimal function of
what is known as the microbiome-gut-brain axis in the
behavioral as well as electrophysiological aspects of brain
action (Davari et al., 2013). There is a preliminary research
on the effect of probiotics on the prognosis of cognition
(Bhattacharjee and Lukiw, 2013). However, data on the
effects of probiotics on improving cognitive disorders are
scarce (Bhattacharjee and Lukiw, 2013; Davari et al., 2013).
Gareau reported that intestinal dysbiosis in germ free animals
(containing no microbiota), bacterial infection with an enteric
pathogen and administration of probiotics can modulate
cognitive behaviors including learning and memory (Gareau,
2014).
Some complications such as cognitive disorders, oxidative
stress, neuroinflammation, insulin resistance, and altered lipid
metabolism, which are observable in AD, are identified to be
influenced by the gut flora as well as probiotics. However, no
direct study has considered the gut microbiota manipulation
in AD patients. Hence, this clinical trial was designed to
assess if reinforcement of the intestinal microbiota via probiotic
supplementation helps to improve cognitive and metabolic
disorders in the AD patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trial Design
This study was a 12-week randomized, double-blind, and
controlled clinical trial.
Participants
Participants included in this study were people with AD (60–95
years old) residing at the Golabchi (Kashan, Iran) and Sadeghyeh
(Esfahan, Iran) Welfare Organizations between December 2015
and February 2016. The AD patients were diagnosed following
the NINDS-ADRDA criteria (McKhann et al., 1984) and
revised criteria from the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s
Association (Jack et al., 2011). Patients with metabolic disorders,
chronic infections and/or other clinically relevant disorders with
exception of AD and consuming probiotic supplements within
6 weeks prior to the study, taking other forms of probiotics
including probiotic yogurt, kefir, and other fermented foods were
excluded.
Ethics Statements
This trial was performed in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. Informed consent was received from all patients before
beginning the study. The research was approved by the ethics
committee of Kashan University of Medical Sciences (KUMS)
and was registered in the Iranian website for registration of
clinical trials (http://www.irct.ir) IRCT201511305623N60.
Study Design
At the onset of the study, all subjects were matched for disease
severity based on gender, BMI, and age. The participants were
then randomly divided into two groups to receive either milk
(control group, n = 30: 24 females and 6 males) or milk
containing a mixture of probiotics (probiotic group, n = 30: 24
females and 6 males) for 12 weeks. The patients were requested
not to change their ordinary physical activity and not to take
any nutritional supplements during the 12-week trial. A trained
researcher recorded dietary intakes (3-day food records) of all
participants at the study baseline, the 3rd, 6th, and 9th week of the
intervention and at the end of the trial. Daily macronutrient and
micronutrient intakes were analyzed by nutritionist IV software
(First Databank, San Bruno, CA). The nutritional questionnaire
was completed by a trained researcher (the first author: E.
Akbari).
Intervention
In the intervention group (n = 30), patients received 200 ml/day
probiotic milk containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus
casei, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Lactobacillus fermentum (2
× 109 CFU/g for each) for 12 weeks. It is generally agreed
that probiotic strains should be of host origin with a beneficial
effect on the host, withstand into food stuff with a high count,
withstand transits through intestine and colonize lumen of
the tract, produce antimicrobial agents, and technologically
appropriate for industrial production (Shewale et al., 2014).
Due to the lack of evidence about the appropriate dosage of
probiotics for AD, we used the above-mentioned doses based
on few previous studies in healthy subjects (Benton et al., 2007;
Mohammadi et al., 2015). Probiotic supplements were produced
by Tak Gen Zist Pharmaceutical Company (Tehran, Iran) that
was approved by the Food and Drug Organization of the Ministry
of Health and Medical Education.

Assessment of Anthropometric Measures
Weight and height of participants were determined in an
overnight fasting status using a standard scale (Seca, Hamburg,
Germany) at the onset of the study and after 12 weeks of the
treatment. BMI was calculated as weight in kg divided by height
in meters squared.
Assessment of Outcomes
The primary outcome measurements were Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) in the current study. The secondary
outcome measurements were biomarkers of oxidative stress,
inflammation and metabolic profiles. The MMSE was used to
assess cognition in the AD subjects (Folstein et al., 1975).
Assessment of Biochemical Parameters
Twelve-hour
fasting
blood
samples
were
collected
by
venipuncture at weeks 0 and 12 at Kashan Reference Laboratory.
The blood samples were taken according to a standard protocol
and immediately centrifuged (Hettich D-78532, Tuttlingen,
Germany). Then, the samples were stored at −80◦C until
analysis. Plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was measured
using the ferric reducing antioxidant power method developed
by Benzie and Strain (1996). Total glutathione (GSH) was
assessed by the method of Beutler et al. (Beutler and Gelbart,
1985). Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations was evaluated
using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance method (Janero,
1990). Serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)
concentrations were quantified by the use of commercial ELISA
kit (LDN, Nordhorn, Germany) with the intra- and inter-assay
CVs 3.5 and 5.4%, respectively. Plasma nitric oxide (NO) were
quantified by the Griess method (Tatsch et al., 2011). Available
kits (Pars Azmun, Tehran, Iran) were used to determine
the concentrations of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), serum
triglyceride (TG), total holesterol, LDL, and HDL. All inter-
and intra-assay CVs for NO, TAC, GSH, MDA, FPG, and lipid
profiles were lower than 5%. Circulating levels of serum insulin
were assessed using ELISA kit (Monobind, California, USA)
with the intra- and inter-assay CVs 3.1 and 4.9%, respectively.
The homeostatic model of assessment for insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR), homeostatic model assessment for B-cell function
(HOMA-B) and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index
(QUICKI) were calculated according to suggested formulas
(Pisprasert et al., 2013).
Statistical Methods
To determine whether or not the study variables were normally
distributed, we applied the Kolmogrov-Smirnov test to the
data. Analyses were conducted based on an intention-to-
treat (ITT) principle. Missing values were treated based on
Last-Observation-Carried-Forward method (LOCF) (Lachin,
2016). LOCF ignores whether the participant’s condition was
improving or deteriorating at the time of dropout, instead, it
freezes outcomes at the values observed before dropout (i.e.,
last observation) (Lachin, 2016). For non-normally distributed
variables (FPG, insulin, HOMA-IR and hs-CRP), we applied
Log transformation. Independent samples Student’s t-test was
used to detect the differences in anthropometric measures as
well as in macronutrient and micronutrient intakes between
the two groups. For comparison of the categorical variables,
Pearson Chi-square test was used. To determine the effects
of probiotic milk consumption on MMSE, biomarkers of
oxidative stress, inflammation, and metabolic profiles, we used
independent samples Student’s t-test. Adjustment for changes
in the baseline values of biochemical parameters, age and BMI
at was performed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using
general linear models. The P-value of < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant. All statistical analyses used the Statistical
Package for Social Science version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
Illinois, USA). To calculate sample size, we used the standard
formula suggested for clinical trials by considering type one
error (α) of 0.05 and type two error (β) of 0.20 (power =
80%). Based on a previous study (Malaguarnera et al., 2007),
we used 1.3 as SD and 1.1 as the difference in mean (d) of
MMSE as key variable. Accordingly, we needed 25 persons
in each group. Assuming 5 dropouts in each group, the final
sample size was determined to be 30 persons per group.
Randomization assignment was conducted using computer-
generated random numbers. Randomization and allocation were
concealed from the researchers and individuals until the final
analyses were completed. The randomized allocation sequence,
enrolling subjects and allocating them to interventions were
conducted by a trained staff at the Welfare Organizations.
RESULTS
All participants were introduced to the MMSE cognitive test.
Also the blood samples were assessed for the biomarkers status.
During the study 4 out of 30 patients in the two groups were died
and a total of 52 subjects [control (n = 26) and probiotic (n = 26)]
completed the experiments (Figure 1). However, as the analysis
was based on the ITT principle, all 60 patients were included
in the final analysis. The between group comparisons are made
considering the post-treatment changes in the baseline values.
No side effects were reported following administration with
probiotic in AD patients throughout the study. Mean age, height,
weight, and BMI at baseline and end of trial were not statistically
different between the two groups (Table 1). Based on the 3-
day dietary records obtained at study baseline, end of trial and
throughout the trial, we found no significant difference in mean
dietary macronutrient and micronutrient intakes between the
two groups (Data not shown).
Cognitive Assessment
The degree of cognitive impairments in the probiotic and
control groups was evaluated by the MMSE test. Twelve weeks
intervention resulted in an improvement in MMSE score in the
probiotic group (+27.90% ± 8.07) compared to their control
counterparts (−5.03% ± 3.00). The difference between the two
groups of testing was statistically significant (P < 0.001).
Biochemical Measurements
Twelve weeks probiotic treatment decreased the level of the
factors affecting metabolism of carbohydrates. The changes in
hs-CRP were −17.61% ± 3.70 and +45.26% ± 3.50 µg/ml

in the probiotic and control groups, respectively (P < 0.001).
HOMH-IR index decreased in the probiotic group (+28.84%
± 13.34) compared to their control counterparts (+76.95%
± 24.60, P = 0.002). The probiotic treatment considerably
reduced the HOMA-B index (+3.45% ± 10.91) in the probiotic
compared to the control (+75.62% ± 23.18) patients leading
to a significant variation between the two groups (P = 0.001).
The QUICKI level was significantly (P = 0.006) increased in
the probiotic subjects (−1.83% ± 1.26) in comparison to their
control counterparts (−4.66% ± 1.70). On the other hand,
the probiotic supplementation was ineffective on the FBP; the
changes are (3.41% ± 2.12) and (4.50% ± 4.39) mg/dl in the
probiotic and control groups, respectively.
The probiotic supplementation differently influenced the lipid
profiles. The TG level was substantially decreased (P = 0.003)
in the probiotic patients (−20.29% ± 4.49 mg/dl) compared
to the control group (−0.16% ± 5.24 mg/dl). Although the
concentration of VLDL was reduced in the probiotic subjects
compared to their control counterparts (−20.29% ± 4.49 vs.
−0.16% ± 5.24 mg/dl, P = 0.003), however, the other lipid
profiles (LDL, HDL and cholesterol) were insensitive to the
probiotic treatment.
It should be noted that the baseline levels of serum
triglycerides, VLDL, and HDL were significantly different
between the two groups. Therefore, we controlled the analyses for
the baseline values of biochemical parameters, age, and baseline
BMI. Nevertheless, this adjustment indicated no considerable
changes in our findings (Data not shown).
The probiotic treatment caused a significant decrease
(P < 0.001) in the MDA of the probiotic group (−22.01% ±
4.84 µmol/l) in comparison to the control patients (+2.67% ±
3.86 µmol/l). We found no difference in the level of the TAC and
NO between the two groups.
Table 2 explains the pre- and post-trial values in the control
and probiotic patients.
DISCUSSION
The
current
study
demonstrated
that
the
probiotic
administration for 12 weeks has favorable effects on MMSE
score, MDA, hs-CRP, markers of insulin metabolism and
triglycerides levels of the AD patients; however, the changes
in other biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation,
FPG and other lipid profiles are negligible. To the best of
our knowledge, this study is the first evaluating the beneficial
effects of probiotic supplementation on cognitive function,
biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammation and metabolic

status in patients with AD. AD patients are predisposed
to some complications including increased oxidative stress
(Sultana et al., 2011), morbidity, mortality (Schelke et al., 2016),
microvascular disease, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance
(Sridhar et al., 2015). Our results indicated that the probiotic
treated patients showed some improvement in their MMSE
scores. Studies considering the effect of probiotic supplements
on brain behavioral phenomena are scant. In our previous
work, we have shown that probiotics efficiently reverse the
impaired spatial learning and memory as well as synaptic
transmission in diabetes mellitus (Davari et al., 2013). It is
demonstrated that other brain related disorders such as multiple
sclerosis (Kouchaki et al., 2016) and stress are also influenced
by probiotics (Liang et al., 2015). In the levels of molecular
mechanism, microbiome is known to play a pronounced
role in synaptic transmission. Numerous studies have shown
capability of bacteria in producing neurotransmitters and
neuromodulators including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA),
norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and acetylcholine (Cryan
and Dinan, 2012). Further, findings from germ free animals
indicated a decreased level of brain derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF), important neurotrophic factor in the neuronal growth
and survival, and a reduced expression of some subunits of
N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (Sudo et al., 2004)
involved in most abundant neurotransmission in brain (Salami
et al., 2000). GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter
in the CNS. Dysfunctions in GABA-signaling are linked to
anxiety and depression, defects in synaptogenesis and cognitive
impairments (Aziz et al., 2013; Mitew et al., 2013). Also the
glutamatergic NMDA receptors are involved in the most
important excitatory neurotransmission of brain (Talaei et al.,
2016) which is engaged in the neural circuits involved in learning
and memory. From these considerations it can be concluded
that, at least through contributing in neurotransmitter synthesis
or receptor expression, probiotics might adjust the brain activity.
Findings of the current study indicated that while the
probiotic supplementation decreased the plasma MDA and the
serum hs-CRP levels it was ineffective on other biomarkers of
oxidative stress and inflammation. Consistent to our findings,
a significant reduction in MDA levels was reported in type
2 diabetic patients after consuming probiotic yogurt (Ejtahed
et al., 2012). In addition, Zarrati et al. (2014) showed that
8 weeks consumption of yogurt, enriched by L. acidophilus,
Bifidobacterium langum, and L. casei (108 CFU/g each) decreased
inflammatory cytokines in overweight people. In contrast, others
reported no beneficial effects of probiotics on biomarkers of
oxidative stress and inflammation. For example, it was reported
that 6 weeks probiotic treatment caused no significant change
in inflammatory factors of diabetic patients (Mazloom et al.,
2013). Furthermore, 8 weeks consumption of capsules containing
108 CFU/g of L. casei by the people suffered from rheumatoid
arthritis displayed no significant within- and between-group
changes in MDA and TAC levels (Vaghef-Mehrabany et al., 2015).
Oxidative stress is a frequently observed feature of AD, although
its pathological significance is not understood (Selvarajah et al.,
2011). Evidence indicates that, through production of reactive
oxygen species, oxidative stress acts as vehicle for deposition
and accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) in AD (Kim et al., 2015).
It has also been postulated that oxidative stress may decrease
the activity of α-secretase, which promotes the expression
and activity of β and γ-secretase, leading to the increased
production of Aβ (Tan et al., 2013). It seems that probable
anti-inflammatory role of probiotics needs further investigation
to be cleared. Altogether, since the microbiota-gut-brain axis
conduits some of its main actions through nerve pathways
both dysbiosis and probiotic treatment could have profound
effects on the CNS functions. Accumulating evidence from
experimental studies supports the hypothesis that; via affecting
inflammation, endocrine system, and neurotransmission; the
gut microbiome takes a crucial role in the CNS function
(Collins et al., 2012; Dinan and Cryan, 2013). Accordingly, it
is suggested that dysfunction of the neuroendocrine system,
behavior, and cognition are correlated with gut microbiota
dysbiosis (Liang et al., 2015). These considerations led to
establishing the term “psychobiotics” to highlight the potential
effects of probiotics in treatment of mental disorders (Wall
et al., 2014). Consistently, in a meta-analysis study, Kasi´
nska
and Drzewoski (2015) reported a reduced HOMA-IR and
insignificant FGP in probiotic treated subjects. Mazloom et al.
(2013) also reported that probiotic supplementation had no
significant effect on fasting blood glucose, markers of insulin
metabolism and lipid profiles. Consumption of symbiotic bread
containing the heat-resistant probiotic Lactobacillus sporogenes
(1 × 108 CFU/g) for 8 weeks also decreased the serum triglyceride
and VLDL concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes
(Shakeri et al., 2014).
Emerging evidence has demonstrated that brain insulin
resistance, as a key mediator in prediabetes and diabetes
mellitus, may take a role in AD (Cervellati et al., 2016).
Insulin resistance plays an important role in the development
of cognitive impairment in primary elderly hypertensive patients
(Ma et al., 2015). On the other hand, the role of lipids
in the etiology and progress of AD is still unclear. Some
evidence from clinical studies support the fact that abnormal
cholesterol metabolism in the brain leads to progressive cognitive

dysfunction (Wang et al., 2014). Accordingly, high lipid levels
could be one of the risk factors for AD (Reitz et al., 2010).
Probiotics intake may improve markers of insulin metabolism
and lipid profiles by reducing cytokines and suppressing
the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B
cells (NF-κB) pathway (Shi et al., 2006) and gut microbiota-
short chain fatty acids (SCFA)-hormone axis (Yadav et al.,
2013).
The current study had some limitations. Measurement of fecal
bacteria loads before and after the probiotic supplementation
in the AD patients was very difficult. In addition, we assessed
cognition of the AD patients based on only MMSE test. Hence,
considering some other cognitive criteria could be helpful in
confirming relevancy of cognition to probiotic supplementation.
Also evaluation of other biomarkers of inflammation and
oxidative stress including interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis
factor alpha (TNF-α), catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD)
seems to be informative.
Overall, the current study demonstrated that 12 weeks
consumption of probiotic in the AD patients had favorable
effects on MDA, hs-CRP, markers of insulin metabolism, and
serum levels of triglyceride and VLDL. However, the pobiotic
treatment was inefective on other biomarkers of oxidative stress
and inflammation, FPG, and other lipid profiles. Considering the
MMSE data we concluded that the probiotic supplementation
shows some hopeful trends that warrant further study to assess
if probiotics have a clinically significant impact on the cognitive
symptoms.
