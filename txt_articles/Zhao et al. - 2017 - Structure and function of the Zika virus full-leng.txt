The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) has infected over 1 million people in over
30 countries. ZIKV replicates its RNA genome using virally encoded replication proteins.
Nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) contains a methyltransferase for RNA capping and
a polymerase for viral RNA synthesis. Here we report the crystal structures of full-length
NS5 and its polymerase domain at 3.0 Å resolution. The NS5 structure has striking similarities
to the NS5 protein of the related Japanese encephalitis virus. The methyltransferase contains
in-line pockets for substrate binding and the active site. Key residues in the polymerase are
located in similar positions to those of the initiation complex for the hepatitis C virus poly-
merase. The polymerase conformation is affected by the methyltransferase, which enables a
more
efficiently
elongation
of
RNA
synthesis
in
vitro.
Overall,
our
results
will contribute to future studies on ZIKV infection and the development of inhibitors of
ZIKV replication.

ZIKV
belongs
in
the
genus Flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family, which also
includes the important human pathogens Japanese encephalitis
virus (JEV) and the Dengues virus (DENV)3. The flavivirus
genome is a positive-sense RNA of 11-kb in length that contains
a 50 cap structure but lacks a polyA tail. The RNA encodes
a long open reading frame that is translated into a polyprotein
that is subsequently processed by viral and host proteases
into three structural and seven nonstructural proteins3.
Nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is essential for the replication of
the flaviviral RNA genome4–6. The N-terminal portion of
NS5 contains a methyltransferase (MT), followed by a short
linker that connects to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp). The MT adds the 50 RNA cap structure to facilitate
translation of the polyprotein and to decrease elicitation of
the host innate immune response7–9. The RdRp initiates
RNA synthesis by a de novo mechanism wherein a single-
nucleotide triphosphate serves as a primer for nucleotide
polymerization10–12. Herein we report the crystal structure
of the Zika virus NS5 protein and the structure of the RdRp
domain. The MT was found to affect the conformation of
the RdRp domain and increase RNA synthesis.
Results
Crystal structure of the ZIKV NS5. We expressed the full-length
NS5 from ZIKV strain MR766 that was originally isolated from
Uganda Africa and determined its crystal structure at 3.0 Å
resolution (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). The polypeptide
chains are well defined except for the N-terminal four residues
and the C-terminal 16 residues (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 2).
The MT is complexed with S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH),
and the RdRp adopts a classic ‘right-hand’ structure consisting of
three subdomains: fingers, palm and thumb (Fig. 1a,b). Two zinc
ions are found in the fingers subdomain and at the junction of the
palm and thumb subdomains of the RdRp.
The overall structure of the ZIKV NS5 has striking similarities
to that of the JEV NS5, with the RMS deviation of 0.55 Å for
751 Ca atoms (Fig. 2a). The MT of both proteins are also located
at an acute angle to the RdRps. The ZIKV MT is in a distinct
orientation relative to the DENV MT. Due to a short 310-helix in
the linker, the DEN MT is rotated toward the RdRp (Fig. 2b,c).
Residues Arg363, Gln598 and Asn576 in the fingers subdomain
of the ZIKV RdRp interact with the linker to prevent it from
being more flexible (Fig. 2d).
Additional interactions between the MT and the RdRp
contribute to the orientation of the MT in the ZIKV NS5.
In the MT, residues 112–128 that forms Loop 9, a6 and
b4 interacts with the a14, Loop 32 and Loop 40 in the RdRp
domain (Supplementary Fig. 3). Notably, residues in these
structures are highly similar in the NS5 proteins of the
ZIKV and JEV, providing an explanation for the similar
orientations of the MT and RdRp in these two proteins (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3a). In addition, Loop 32 of the DENV NS5 was
disordered, likely contributing to the altered orientation of the
MT in the DENV NS5.
The NS5 MTase domain. The MT of ZIKV NS5 adopts a classic
a/b/a sandwich structure13. The ZIKV MT can be superimposed
with the MTs from other flaviviruses with RMS deviations of
o0.73 Å (Fig. 3a). The highly conserved structure allows
assignment of the residues that function in RNA cap addition
in the ZIKV MT. Residues that bind GTP, catalyse methyl
transfer and bind the methyl donor S-adenosyl-methionine

 (SAM) are arranged in a line within a concave surface of the MT
(Fig. 3b,c). The conserved catalytic tetrad of Lys61–Asp146–
Lys182–Glu218 that forms the active site is positioned in
the centre of the MT (Fig. 3c,d). The putative GTP binding
pocket is located to the left of the active site. The SAM-binding
pocket is located in a narrow crevice to the right of the
catalytic pocket (Fig. 3a,c). SAH, the byproduct of methyl
donation from SAM, has the adenylate embedded in a narrow
portion of the active site channel, where the Od1 of Asp131
forms a H-bond with the N6 of adenine and the Nd1 of
His110 forms a H-bond with the ribose 20 OH (ref. 7).
The homocysteine portion of SAH interacts with loop residues
79–85 (Fig. 3d).
The NS5 polymerase domain. Viral RdRps typically have
extensive interactions between the fingers and thumb subdomains
to encircle the active site of the polymerase14,15. Three channels
are apparent in the ZIKV polymerase. Based on comparison
with polymerases whose ternary structures have been determined
and characterized16, the channels should bind the template
RNA (template channel), guide the emergence of the template
and nascent RNA (central channel) and enable the entry of
the NTPs (NTP channel) (Fig. 4). Motifs A to G that are
conserved in sequence and structure, line the active site cavity
and contribute to nucleotide and template recognition and
nucleotide polymerization.
The active site of the ZIKV RdRp is enclosed due to
the interaction between motifs F and G that project from the
fingers to contact the thumb in the front of the RdRp
(Fig. 4a,b). The back of the RdRp has a lattice of three
loops (Fig. 4a,b). The template RNA will bend at a ca. 45�
angle and emerge from the central channel. The NTP channel
will merge at the confluence of the template and central
channels
(Fig.
4b,c).
Here
three
aspartates
from
motifs
C and A (Asp535, Asp665 and Asp666) that coordinate

are
localized. The priming loop, which positions nucleotides for
polymerization15,
extends
from
the
thumb
subdomain
is
located at the confluence of the three channels (Fig. 4d). In the
phage phi6 and HCV RdRp, a tyrosine in the priming
element has been shown to form the priming platform by
stacking
interacting
with
the
initiating
nucleotide16,17.
In
the ZIKV NS5, Trp797 likely performs the role of stacking
with first nucleotide to facilitate initiation of de novo RNA
synthesis (Fig. 4d).

RNA
and
nucleotides
for
RNA
synthesis. The priming loop of the ZIKV RdRp is larger

 MTase interacts with the polymerase to affect RNA synthesis.
The MT of the ZIKV NS5 connects to the fingers subdomain
of the RdRp and overhangs the NTP channel of the RdRp
(Fig. 5a). The MT interacts with the fingers subdomain of the
RdRp primarily through a hydrophobic network that involves
residues Pro113, Leu115 and Trp121 from the MT and
Tyr350, Phe466 and Pro584 from the RdRp (Fig. 5b). The total
buried surface area between the MT and the RdRp is B1,600 Å2.
The close proximity of the MT to the RdRp suggests that the
MT may impact RNA synthesis by the RdRp.
To examine whether the interaction of the MT with the RdRp
will affect RNA synthesis, we compared the RNA synthesis activity
of NS5 to that of a truncated protein, D264, which lacks the
MT (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The full-length ZIKV NS5 could
initiate RNA synthesis de novo or elongate from a primed template
in processes that will require distinct RdRp conformations (Fig. 5c,
Supplementary Fig. 5b,c). NS5 that had the two aspartates in motif
C replaced with alanines was unable to direct RNA synthesis either
by de novo initiation or by elongation from a primed template
(Supplementary Fig. 5b,c). D264 synthesized approximately half of
the de novo-initiated RNA product as did full-length NS5 (Fig. 5c,
Supplementary
Fig.
6).
However,
with
the
template
that
directs elongative RNA synthesis, D264 synthesized sevenfold less
product
than
did
NS5.
Our result
demonstrates
that
the
MT contributes to RNA synthesis by the RdRp, especially for
elongative RNA synthesis.
The orientation of the MT relative to the template channel
and the central channel suggests that it will affect RdRp
interaction with the template RNA. A reversible crosslinking,
mass spectrometric assay was used to map residues in NS5 that
contact the template RNA19. The peptides from NS5 that
contacted the RNA were mapped to the template channel,
the fingers subdomain and all motifs in the RdRp except for
motifs F and D (Fig. 5d, Supplementary Fig. 7a,b). Intere-
stingly, the MT, especially the residues adjacent to the fingers
subdomain of the RdRp, also had extensive contact with the
template RNA.
Altered RdRp structure in the absence of MTase domain.
To better understand the difference in RNA synthesis by NS5 and
the RdRp, we determined the crystal structure of D264 at
3.0 Å resolution. The asymmetric unit contains eight RdRps
that exist in two conformations (referred to as conformation
1 and 2) that vary in the locations of motif G, Loop 21 (residues
312–323) and Loop 51 (residues 742–750) that connect the
thumb and fingers subdomains (Fig. 5e). The two conformations
are affected by residue Arg483 that lies in the template channel.
In conformation 1, the side chain of Arg483 inserts between
motifs B and F and interacts with the carbonyl backbone of
Gly604 and Trp476 (Fig. 5e, Supplementary Fig. 8a). In
conformation 2, the locations of motifs B and F prevents the

 insertion of the side chain of Arg483. Instead, Arg483 interacts
with Ala409 of motif G (Fig. 5e, Supplementary Fig. 8b).
Full-length NS5 only has one conformation in the corresponding
region and it resembles that of conformation 2 (Fig. 5e,
Supplementary Fig. 8c). Notably, motif F in NS5 binds with
the MT and has a different conformation relative to that in
D264 (Fig. 5f). The net effect of the presence of the MT is that
the RdRp has a reconfigured template channel and possesses
a more open NTP channel (Fig. 5f,g). These changes will
likely decrease RNA synthesis.
RNA synthesis by pandemic ZIKV NS5. The current pandemic
ZIKV have been observed to be associated with serious human
illness1. Strain Brazil/PE243/2015 that was identified from
a patient from Recife in Brazil, has more than 35 amino
acid substitutions in the NS5 when compared to MR766
(Fig. 6a,b). In terms of RNA synthesis in vitro, NS5 proteins
from
Brazilian/PE243/2015
and
MR766
have
comparable
activities
to
direct
de
novo-initiated
and
elongative
RNA
synthesis (Fig. 6c). Mapping of residues changed in the NS5
protein of the Brazil/PE243/2015 onto the MR766 NS5 structure
reveals that the substitutions are located on the surface of
NS5 and are not involved in the core of the RdRp that can affect
RNA synthesis (Fig. 6d).
Discussion
We have determined the crystal structures of the Zika virus
NS5
protein
and
the
isolated
polymerase
domain.
The
NS5 protein used was functional for RNA synthesis in vitro,
producing RNA that initiated de novo from the 30 terminal
nucleotide of an exogenously provided template and also
elongated from a primed template. The MT domain was shown
to bind to the template RNA, and its presence increased
elongative RNA synthesis by the RdRp domain. The RdRp
alone was also competent for RNA synthesis, but was less
active for RNA synthesis in vitro (Fig. 5c). This result is in
contrast to that of the DENV NS5 protein, where the removal of
the MT was shown to increase RNA synthesis in vitro20.
However, the NS5 proteins of the ZIKV and the DENV differ
in the network of interactions and the orientations of the MT and
RdRp domains. These differences may affect RNA synthesis
by the resulting recombinant proteins.
The structure of the ZIKV NS5 protein reveals remarkable
similarities with the equivalent structures of other viruses from
the Flaviviridae family. The active sites for MT activity and
RNA synthesis are especially well-conserved. These results
suggest that inhibitors of viral MT activity and/or RNA synthesis
can be developed to inhibit ZIKV replication. In fact, nucleoside
analogues that can inhibit the polymerases of Dengue virus, West
Nile virus and yellow fever virus have recently been shown to
affect RNA synthesis by ZIKV NS5 (refs 5,21–24). Sofosbuvir,
which is highly effective in treating hepatitis C, also has modest
inhibitory activity for the replication of the ZIKV25. Elucidating
additional structures of the ZIKV NS5 complexed to nucleotides
and also molecular dynamic studies with the ZIKV NS5 protein
with potential inhibitors could aid in the development of
inhibitors with higher specificity and potency.

 While the Zika virus was initially detected in 1947 in the
forest of Uganda Africa, serious illness associated with Zika virus
infection was first recorded in Micronesia in 2011 (refs 1,26).
At present, the basis for the increased illness associated with
the more recent Zika virus outbreak remains to be established.
Our
comparison
of
the
recombinant
NS5
proteins
from
Africa and from Brazil revealed similar levels of RNA synthesis.
In addition, the residues of the Brazilian ZIKV that differ
from those of the MR766 virus from Africa are mostly on the
surface of the NS5 protein and are less likely to affect the
mechanism of RNA-dependent RNA synthesis. The changes,
however, could impact interactions with other ZIKV proteins or
with cellular proteins.
Methods
Chemicals. SAH was from Sigma and dissolved in H2O. Isopropyl b-D-1-thioga-
lactopyranoside, imidazole, dithiothreitol, formaldehyde and all other chemicals
are from Sigma. Trypsin was purchased from Promega. Ni-NTA resin was
from Invitrogen. a-32P-CTP and a-32P-ATP were purchased from PerkinElmer.
RNAs were synthesized from Integrated DNA Technologies.
Gene construction. DNA encoding NS5 from ZIKV MR766 (GenBank:
NC_012532.1) and Brazilian Zika virus PE243/2015 (GenBank: KX197192.1) were
chemically synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies). The cDNA sequences
are in Supplementary Table 1. The cDNA fragment was subcloned into
a pET-SUMO vector. The plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21
Rosetta(DE3) pLysS (Novagen) for protein expression. N-terminal truncations of
NS5 that lacked the MT (D264) were generated via polymerase chain reaction using
the forward primer of the sequence of 50-ACAGAGAACAGATTGGTGGTGCTGT
GGCAAGCTGTGCTGAGGCT-30 and the reverse primer with the sequence of
50-CGGATCCGTTATCCACTTTTACAACACTCCGGGTGTGGACCCTTC-30.
Mutations of the RdRp active site were generated via site-directed mutagenesis
using the forward primer with the sequence of 50-CGTATGGCCGTGAGCGG
CGCTGCTTGTGTAGTGAAGCCAATTGA-30 and the reverse primer of the
sequence 50-TCAATTGGCTTCACTACACAAGCAG-CGCCGCTCACGGC
CATACG-30 the QuickChange II kit (Agilent Technologies).
Recombinant protein production and purification. Recombinant proteins were
expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) pLys cells (Novagen) grown in Difco LB broth
containing ampicillin (50 mg ml � 1) and chloramphenicol (17 mg ml � 1). When
the cultures reached an OD600 of 1.0–1.3, the temperature was reduced to 16 �C,
and isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of
0.4 mM. After a 20 h incubation, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation.
The E. coli cell pellets were suspended in TN buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0,
500 mM NaCl) containing 10 mM imidazole and lysed by sonification. After
clarification of the lysate by centrifugation at 15,000g for 30 min, the supernatant
was loaded onto a Ni-NTA column that was pre-equilibrated with TN buffer.
The column was subsequently washed with TN buffer containing 5 mM
b-mercaptoethanol (TNB) and 25 mM imidazole, then TNB buffer containing
40 mM imidazole. The protein was eluted with the TNB buffer containing 350 mM
imidazole then exchanged into the TNB buffer containing 20% glycerol. The
SUMO-NS5 fusion protein was treated with SUMO protease overnight at 4 �C.
NS5 was separated from SUMO and the protease by passage through a second

 Ni-NTA column. Solutions of NS5 were concentrated and purified with
a Superdex200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) that was pre-equilibrated with
the R buffer (20% glycerol, 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol)
containing 500 mM NaCl. D264 that lack the MT was purified using the
same protocol except that the Superdex200 column used R buffer containing
150 mM NaCl. All purified proteins were concentrated and stored at � 80 �C.
Crystallization. ZIKV NS5 at 5 mg ml � 1 and with a 10 molar excess of SAH was
used for crystallization. Crystals were grown in 0.1 M bis–tris pH 5.5, 1.0 M
ammonium sulfate and 1% (wt/vol) PEG 3350. ZIKV NS5 D264 containing
the RdRp domain was crystallized in 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.2 M sodium
citrate tribasic dehydrate and 17% PEG 3350. All proteins were crystallized by
hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method at 4 �C. The crystals were flash-frozen in
liquid nitrogen in the reservoir solution containing 25% glycerol.
Data collection and structure determination. Diffraction data were collected
at beamline 5.0.2 of the advanced light source with a Pilatus 6M detector. The
data were processed with iMOSFLM27 and merged with Aimless in the CCP4
package28. The structure of full-length NS5 was determined by molecular
replacement using homology models of NS5 MT and RdRp generated with
Swiss-model as search models. JEV NS5 structure (PDB 4k6m) was used to
generate the homology models. An SAH molecule was docked into the difference
map of the MT. The structure of D264 was determined by molecular replacement
using the homology model of NS5 RdRp as the search model. Phaser in the Phenix
package was used for structural determination29. The models were manually
adjusted using Coot30 and refined using the Phenix package. Statistics from
crystallographic analyses of the two structures are in Table 1. All figures depicting
structures were generated using PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org).
In vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase assay. RNA synthesis assays were
performed in 20 ml of reaction containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 ng of
purified ZIKV protein, 1 mM MnCl2, 5 mM DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mM each
of ATP, UTP and GTP and 33 nM of a-32P-CTP. Where present, chemically
synthesized RNAs DN17 and PE46 (IDT) were, respectively, at 50 and 100 nM.

Figure 5 | The MT affects RNA synthesis by the ZIKV RdRp. (a) Cut-away surface representation showing the locations of the MT and the RdRp in
full-length ZIKV NS5. The MToverhangs the NTP channel and contacts the fingers subdomain of the RdRp. (b) Interactions between the MTdomain (cyan)
and the fingers subdomain (green). Dashed lines indicate distance o3.5 Å. (c) In vitro RNA synthesis catalysed by full-length ZIKV NS5 and D264 that
lacks the MT. Each set of reactions were performed with 5, 20, 100 and 200 ng of NS5 protein or D264 (Supplementary Fig. 6). The PE of 46-nt denotes an
elongated product RNA. DN denotes the 17-nt product RNA that initiated de novo with a NTP from the 30-most template nucleotide. The templates used for
RNA synthesis are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5. The relative amounts of the products made by D264 are normalized to those generated by the same
concentration of the enzyme in the reaction with NS5. The results shown are reproducible in four independent assays. (d) Regions of ZIKV NS5 that
contact the template RNA (PE46) for elongative RNA synthesis. Residues from peptides that are reversibly crosslinked to PE46 are shown in yellow. The
structure shown is oriented to show the view at the back of the RdRp that connects to the MT. (e) Conformational changes of the RdRp in the absence of
the MT. Comparison of eight D264 structures in one asymmetric unit reveals two distinct conformations in loop 312–323 and loop 742–750 located in
the back of the RdRp and Motif G. Conformation 2 of D264 is similar to that in full-length NS5. (f) The different conformations of motif F in full-length
NS5 (orange) and isolated RdRp (D264, green). (g) Surface representation showing the different conformations of motif F in full-length NS5 (orange) and
isolated RdRp (D264, green).

 The reactions were incubated at 30 �C for 90 min, then heated for 3 min at
95 �C and loaded directly onto 22% polyacrylamide gels that contained 7.5 M
urea and 1/2 � TBE buffer. The gels were separated at 300 V for 3–3.5 h. Radio-
active RNA product was detected by a Typhoon Scanner and quantified
using ImageQuant software. Radiolabeled RNA markers consisted of chemically
synthesized RNAs of 16-, 17- and 18-nt were kinased with g-32P-ATP.
Radiolabeled RNA markers of 19- and 46-nt were produced using the recombinant
HCV NS5B as described previously31.
Mapping NS5–RNA interaction. Residues in NS5 that contact RNA were mapped
using the reversible crosslinking affinity purification assay19. ZIKV NS5 2 mM were
mixed with RNA PE46 RNA (4mM) and crosslinked with formaldehyde and
processed for mass spectrometry. Control reactions were processed in parallel in the
absence of formaldehyde. HPLC–MS analysis was conducted on an LTQ Orbitrap XL
mass spectrometer equipped with an Accela HPLC and an electrospray ion source
(Thermo Scientific). Peptides were eluted over a 90-min gradient, and tandem MS
data was acquired using collision-induced dissociation. Peptides were identified using
SearchGUI (v3.1.0)32, and searched against a concatenated target/decoy database
constructed from the cRAP database (http://www.thegpm.org/crap/index.html) of the
sequence of ZIKV NS5. Identification settings included an unspecific protease,
10 p.p.m. MS1, and 0.3Da MS2 error tolerances and oxidation of methionine as a
variable modification. MS2 peptide spectrum matches were inferred using
PeptideShaker (v1.13.3)33. Posterior error probability was calculated in PeptideShaker
using the ratio of hits from the decoy database relative to the true database search.
Only assignments with high confidence and in two independent replicates and those
absent in the control reactions were used.

NS5 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession code 5U0B.
The coordinates for the structure of the RdRp domain have been deposited in
the Protein Data Bank under the accession code 5U0C. The PDB accession
codes 4K6M, 4WTL, 3P97, 3ECV, 2OY0 and 5DTO were used in this study.
The UniProt accession codes Q32ZE1and ANC90425.2 and the NCBI accession
codes NC_012532.1 and KX197192.1 were used in this study. All other data are

Figure 6 | NS5 protein from a ZIKV isolated from Brazil has comparable RNA synthesis as the MR766 NS5. (a) Schematic of the ZIKV NS5 showing the
locations of the motifs and residues that are different in the NS5 from Brazil/PE243/2015 (GenBank KX197192.1) when compared to the MR766
(NC_012532.1). (b) Locations of residues in the Brazil/PE243/2015 in the context of the MR766 NS5 structure. The MT is coloured cyan. The fingers,
thumb and palm subdomains in the NS5 RdRp are coloured green, slate and orange, respectively. Residues that differed in the NS5 from Brazil/PE243/2015
are shown in bright red sticks. (c) Comparison of RNA synthesis by the NS5 from isolate MR766 and Brazil/PE243/2015. The primer extension (PE)
product is of 46-nt. The de novo-initiated (DN) production is of 17-nt. RNAs shorter than full-length are aborted during RNA synthesis or prematurely
terminated. The RNAs longer than 17-nt in the DN assay are the result of terminal nucleotide addition to the template RNA. Uncropped gel images are
shown in Supplementary Fig. 9.
