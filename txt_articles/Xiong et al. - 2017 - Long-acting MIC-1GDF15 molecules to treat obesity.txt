In search of metabolically regulated secreted proteins, we conducted a microarray study comparing gene ex-
pression in major metabolic tissues of fed and fasted ob/ob mice and C57BL/6 mice. The array used in this study
included probes for ~4000 genes annotated as potential secreted proteins. Circulating macrophage inhibitory
cytokine 1 (MIC-1)/growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) concentrations were increased in obese mice, rats, and
humans in comparison to age-matched lean controls. Adeno-associated virus–mediated overexpression of GDF15
and recombinant GDF15 treatments reduced food intake and body weight and improved metabolic profiles in var-
ious metabolic disease models in mice, rats, and obese cynomolgus monkeys. Analysis of the GDF15 crystal struc-
ture suggested that the protein is not suitable for conventional Fc fusion at the carboxyl terminus of the protein.
Thus, we used a structure-guided approach to design and successfully generate several Fc fusion molecules with
extended half-life and potent efficacy. Furthermore, we discovered that GDF15 delayed gastric emptying, changed
food preference, and activated area postrema neurons, confirming a role for GDF15 in the gut-brain axis responsible
for the regulation of body energy intake. Our work provides evidence that GDF15 Fc fusion proteins could be
potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of obesity and related comorbidities.
INTRODUCTION
Obesity and its comorbidities are public health concerns that are ep-
idemic worldwide (1). One of the most effective treatments for weight
loss is Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, which involves the reduction
of the size of the stomach and bypassing a portion of the small intes-
tine (2). Although the procedure results in a marked weight loss, it is
an invasive complex surgery that leaves the patient with permanent
undesirable side effects; therefore, there is a need for pharmaco-
logical therapies that are safe and efficacious and that can be
administered long-term (3).
During a search for secreted factors that are metabolically regu-
lated in liver and adipose tissues, we identified macrophage inhibi-
tory cytokine 1/growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), an atypical
member of the transforming growth factor–b (TGF-b) superfamily
(4–7), to which we will refer as GDF15 going forward. GDF15 is a
homodimer cysteine knot protein containing one interchain and eight
intrachain disulfide bonds (4). GDF15 is implicated in multiple disor-
ders of metabolism such as obesity, insulin resistance, and cancer ca-
chexia (8). Ablation of GDF15 in genetically engineered mice resulted
in increased body weight, whereas overexpression resulted in mice
with lower body weight and fat mass and improved metabolic para-
meters (9, 10). These findings support GDF15 as a regulator of body
weight and energy balance; however, many of the physiological effects
of GDF15 remain unclear. A definitive receptor or clear signaling
mechanism has not conclusively been described, and how GDF15 reg-
ulates body weight remains a question. Some insight into GDF15
function comes from studies where both the area postrema (AP) and
the nucleus of the solitary tract were ablated in mice: After ablation of
these regions, mice no longer responded to the anorectic actions of
GDF15 (11). Neurons from this region participate in energy regulation
and can be activated by GDF15 (12), suggesting that GDF15 may have
a role in controlling the gut-brain–mediated neuronal pathway.
The clinical development of GDF15 as a therapeutic offers several
challenges. The native molecule presents poor pharmacokinetics
(PK) and drug-like properties, including a circulating half-life of
3 hours in mice and cynomolgus monkeys, low production yield,
and manufacturing challenges. To investigate the role of GDF15 in
metabolism and produce a potential therapeutic modality to treat
obesity, we generated and tested recombinant GDF15 and half-life
extended variants of GDF15 in obese mice, rats, and monkeys. These
molecules demonstrated strong efficacy in lowering body weight in
every species tested and improved multiple metabolic parameters.
Therefore, GDF15-based therapeutics could become an efficacious
therapy to treat obesity and related metabolic disorders, a major
chronic health burden in modern society (1).
RESULTS
GDF15 is up-regulated with obesity, and AAV-GDF15
improves metabolic parameters in mice
GDF15 was identified as a highly up-regulated gene in the liver and fat
of ob/ob mice in a microarray study to identify secreted proteins that
were differentially expressed in animal models of obesity (Fig. 1A).
Circulating concentrations of GDF15 in obese mice, rats, and humans
were also significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the obese groups than
normal lean controls across species (Fig. 1B). Increased GDF15 con-
centrations have been reported in various pathological conditions, but
the physiological relevance of the increase is unclear (13). To assess

 whether GDF15 regulates energy metabolism, we administered adeno-
associated virus–expressing human GDF15 (AAV-hGDF15) in several
obese mouse models. AAV-hGDF15 reduced food intake and body
weight and improved metabolic profiles in diet-induced obese (DIO)
mice (Fig. 1C), as well as in ob/ob, db/db, and KKAy mice (fig. S1,
A to C). The reduction in body mass of the AAV-hGDF15 DIO mice
included both fat mass and lean mass, but the loss of fat mass was
greater than the loss of lean mass (Fig. 1D). To get a better repre-
sentation of the loss of body mass, we included a group of untreated
12-week-old mice fed a normal chow diet (12-week lean) as a control,

 and we subjected the mice to dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
(DEXA) measurements to determine fat and lean mass and bone min-
eral density (Fig. 1D). AAV-hGDF15 17-month-old DIO mice showed
similar body mass composition to the lean 12-week-old chow-fed mice
(Fig. 1D). No significant changes in bone mineral density were ob-
served (Fig. 1D). Our findings align with data from other groups report-
ing that GDF15 transgenic mice were resistant to obesity induced by a
high-fat diet (9, 14). Clinical and histopathology analyses of 1-year-old
DIO mice treated with AAV-hGDF15 revealed no detrimental effects
associated with GDF15 overexpression in the brain, heart, lung, liver,
gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, kidney, skeletal muscle, stomach, duode-
num, jejunum, ileum, colon, prostate gland, preputial gland, skin, or
adipose tissue (table S1).
Recombinant (r) GDF15 proteins and antibodies were tested in a
variety of disease models. Both recombinant murine (rm) GDF15 and
recombinant human (rh) GDF15 proteins demonstrated very similar
efficacy and potency in reduction of food intake in ob/ob mice (fig. S2A).
In these mice, treatment with rhGDF15 protein reduced food intake
and body weight, whereas treatment with an mGDF15 antibody
blocking endogenous GDF15 activity increased body weight and food
intake, demonstrating that GDF15 regulates body energy homeosta-
sis (fig. S2, B to E). In DIO mice, daily treatment with rhGDF15 for
4 weeks decreased food intake, body weight, blood glucose, serum
insulin, serum triglyceride, and cholesterol concentrations and im-
proved glucose tolerance in a dose-dependent manner (fig. S3A). Simi-
larly, daily treatment with rhGDF15 for
6 weeks in obese cynomolgus monkeys
reduced food intake, body weight, plasma
insulin, and plasma triglyceride con-
centrations and improved glucose toler-
ance (fig. S3, B and C). PK properties of
rhGDF15 are shown in fig. S4 (A, in mice,
and B, in cynomolgus monkeys).
GDF15 crystal structure and Fc
fusion GDF15 molecules
We used a structure-based approach to
design GDF15 fusion proteins with a
longer half-life and higher production
yield than the native protein (11 mg per
liter of mammalian culture) after we had
solved the crystal structure of GDF15 at
2.3 Å resolution. This structure resembles
those of other TGF-b superfamily mem-
bers (15, 16), forming a homodimer that
is stabilized by an interchain disulfide
bond (Fig. 2, A and B). Although the
GDF15 receptors are unknown, the in-
terface for the type I receptor is speculated
to be around the palm/wrist region and
type II receptor around the fingertip, sim-
ilar to the ternary complex of TGF-b/a–
TbR1–TbRII (17, 18). The C terminus of
GDF15 is packed against a hydrophobic
patch of the opposite monomer (Fig. 2C).
Ile-112, the last residue observed in the
structure, is buried and constrained be-
cause of a disulfide bond between Cys-111
and Cys-48. A fusion protein introduced
at the C terminus would negatively affect the dimer formation
and consequently its function. In contrast, the N terminus of the
two GDF15 monomers in the ternary complex are fully exposed and
adopt the same orientation, making them desirable sites for engineer-
ing the fusion. Because of the distance mismatch between the N ter-
minus of GDF15 dimer (38 Å) (Fig. 2B) and the C terminus of Fc
dimer (20 Å) (fig. S5A), direct fusion of Fc to GDF15 subunit was chal-
lenging to produce, so a flexible linker was inserted between Fc and
GDF15. A fusion protein with a modified Fc deleted hinge region
(DhFc) (Fig. 2D) was active in the ob/ob mouse food intake assay
[half-maximal effective dose (ED50), 2.1 mg/kg; Fig. 2D] but had a rela-
tively low yield of ~1 mg per liter of culture.
To increase protein production, we designed a fusion protein
with one GDF15 subunit per Fc dimer by incorporating a set of com-
plementary charges in the CH3 domains of the Fc region (CpmFc;
Fig. 2D and fig. S5B) (19). This insertion relieved the Fc CH3 interface
constraint on the GDF15 dimer and greatly enhanced the protein
yield (270 mg per liter of culture), but the activity was substantial-
ly reduced (ED50, 112 mg/kg; Fig. 2D). However, truncating the N-
terminal hinge region of the Fc (DhCpmFc; Fig. 2D) retained the
protein yield (272 mg per liter of culture) and recovered most of
the activity (ED50, 7.8 mg/kg; Fig. 2D). The single-chain Fc version
(ScFc; Fig. 2D) demonstrated reasonable product yield and poten-
cy (ED50, 18.4 mg/kg; yield, 90 mg per liter conditioned medium;
Fig. 2D).

 Fc fusion GDF15 molecules improve metabolic parameters
in obese mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys
PK analyses indicated that DhCpmFc and ScFc were suitable for
weekly dosing in mice and cynomolgus monkeys (fig. S6, A and B).
Weekly treatment with both analogs demonstrated similar efficacy
in DIO mice (Fig. 3A) and obese cynomolgus monkeys (Fig. 3, B
and C). In DIO mice, both molecules decreased body weight, serum
insulin, triglyceride and total cholesterol concentrations, and food
intake and decreased glucose area under the curve (AUC) during
oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) (Fig. 3A). Similarly, in obese
cynomolgus monkeys, both molecules decreased body weight, plas-
ma glucose, insulin, triglyceride levels, and food intake (Fig. 3B). Plas-
ma cholesterol concentrations were transiently increased only during
the treatment (Fig. 3B). These transient increases were correlated with
short-term (overnight) fasting in monkeys; the initial exposure to
GDF15 and increase in cholesterol concentrations were lessened as
food intake began to rebound during the treatment period and returned
to the baseline cholesterol concentrations similar to the vehicle-treated
group. Insulin AUC measured during OGTT improved at weeks 2
and 5 during the treatment period but was not significantly different
at week 8 during the washout period (Fig. 3C). DhCpmFc was also
tested in Zucker fatty rats. It decreased body weight, serum insulin con-
centrations, food intake, and glucose AUC during OGTT (fig. S7).
GDF15 delays gastric emptying, changes food preference,
and activates AP neurons
To understand how GDF15 affects energy intake, we measured gas-
tric emptying in mice receiving vehicle or rhGDF15. Vehicle-treated
groups emptied 20 and 31% of ingested phenol red solution at 5 and
15 min after oral gavage, respectively; however, rhGDF15-treated mice
emptied 13 and 18% of the solution at these same time points (Fig. 4A).
Vagal efferent and afferent signals play important roles in postprandial
gastric emptying (20, 21), so we further tested GDF15 in mice after bi-
lateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. As expected, vagotomized ani-
mals showed delayed gastric emptying compared to sham-operated
animals (fig. S8A). GDF15-induced delay of gastric emptying was
preserved in sham-operated animals but was not observed in mice after
vagotomy, suggesting that GDF15 may act through a vagal-mediated
mechanism (fig. S8A). We also investigated whether the GDF15 effect
is partially mediated by the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) pathway.
GDF15 treatment did not change circulating GLP-1 concentrations
(fig. S8B), suggesting that GDF15 most likely exerts its effect indepen-
dently of GLP-1 production.
We also observed that GDF15 treatment changed taste preferences.
Without rhGDF15 treatment, animals preferred a condensed milk diet
of moderately high fat content (32.5% calories from fat) over standard
rodent chow when the two diets were presented at 1:1 ratio, with about
80% of total food consumed being condensed milk chow (Fig. 4B).
After rhGDF15 treatment, the preference for the condensed milk
chow was largely reduced, with about 55% of total food consumed
being condensed milk chow and 45% standard rodent chow (Fig. 4B).
When animals were given access to both diets, standard rodent chow
consumed by the rhGDF15-treated group was actually more than what
the vehicle-treated group consumed, although the total amount of food
consumed by the rhGDF15-treated group was still less than for
vehicle-treated group (fig. S8C), but rhGDF15 treatment reduced intake
of standard rodent chow when it was the only food animals had access
to (fig. S8D). When animals had access only to condensed milk diet,
rhGDF15 reduced intake of condensed milk diet (fig. S8E).
To get a better understanding of action sites of GDF15, we con-
ducted binding studies in the stomach, jejunum, colon, and liver and
examined neuron activities after GDF15 treatment. We observed up-
regulation of the immediate early gene c-Fos in the AP of the brain in
response to exogenously administered rhGDF15 protein compared to
a known activator of c-FOS in the AP, amylin (Fig. 4C and fig. S9).
On average, 12 (±3) c-FOS–positive cells per 0.04 mm2 were counted
in the AP after exposure to amylin or rhGDF15 (10 mg/kg) protein, as
compared to 1 (±1) cells in the 1 mg/kg group and vehicle group.
The AP receives afferent output from the gut. Therefore, we inves-
tigated whether exogenously administrated GDF15 protein binds to
the gut by immunohistochemical detection of the Fc portion of
DhCpmFc after intravenous injection. Compared to Fc control, the
binding pattern of Fc immunoreactivity indicated that DhCpmFc lo-
calized to neuronal beds in the colon, stomach, and jejunum (Fig. 4D
and fig. S10, A and B) but not to the liver (fig. S10C). Although lower
circulating concentrations of control Fc versus DhCpmFc could have
contributed to differences in Fc staining intensity, the similarity of
the staining intensity in DhCpmFc-treated gut sections at 2 hours
and 4 days despite about 10-fold lower exposure at the latter time point
(Fig. 4D) suggests that the labeling is specific because nonspecific
bound Fc constructs are likely to be removed during perfusion. In
DhCpmFc-treated gut sections, we conducted double labeling with
antibodies to Fc and to PGP9.5, a neuronal specific marker. PGP9.5
staining overlapped with Fc immunoreactivity in putative neuronal
structures, suggesting a connection between GDF15 and the myenteric
plexus of the gut (Fig. 4E).
DISCUSSION
Obesity is one of the biggest health care problems society is currently
facing, and treatments that do not involve invasive surgery are greatly
needed. GDF15 is a potential approach to treat this problem; however,
challenges exist in developing GDF15 as a viable therapeutic agent,
particularly due to the short serum half-life of the native protein. En-
gineering a molecule with a long serum half-life while maintaining
efficacy is the key to resolving these issues.
Fusion of proteins to a half-life–extending moiety is a common
practice to improve the PK of therapeutic molecules. For example, fu-
sion partners include proteins such as serum albumin and Fc, as well
as nonprotein entities such as polyethylene glycol. To enhance the PK
properties of GDF15, we evaluated the Fc fragment of an immuno-
globulin G1 (IgG1) antibody as a fusion partner. The first design chal-
lenge was to identify the site where GDF15 could be fused, because
analysis of the GDF15 crystal structure suggested that the C terminus
of GDF15 is buried and not accessible for fusion. Fortunately, the N
terminus of GDF15 provided opportunities for fusion partner design.
The second challenge was to determine a stable placement of the Fc
dimer with the GDF15 dimer. GDF15 forms a homodimer that is sta-
bilized by an interchain disulfide bond, similar to other TGF-b super-
family members. To overcome the potential physical constraints caused
by the Fc CH3 dimer, we designed a fusion protein where each GDF15
monomer is fused to an Fc dimer through a flexible linker (G4S)4. The
flexible linker has additional benefits; that is, it allows the GDF15 re-
ceptor to access the canonical type I and type II receptor binding sites.
The engineered Fc-GDF15 fusion protein showed increased yield and
maintained biological activity.
Control of digestive system function is locally regulated by the en-
teric nervous system. This complex nervous system of the gut regulates

 many processes, including peristaltic contraction of smooth muscles
(22), which in turn exerts control over digestive tract motility. Para-
sympathetic and sympathetic fibers connect the central nervous
system with the digestive tract, and vagal nerves connecting the gut
to the medulla oblongata are one of the main pathways controlling
gut motility (23). Circumventricular organs of the medulla oblong-
ata, particularly the AP, can be accessed by circulating factors, and
GDF15 activation of these neurons and resulting effects on gastric
motility could explain changes seen in gastric emptying. Also, bariatric
surgery, a very effective treatment for obesity, is associated with de-
layed gastric emptying (24, 25) and loss of preference to nutrition-
dense high-fat diet (25, 26). It is intriguing that GDF15 affected the
same observed biological activities as bariatric surgery, and circulating
concentrations of GDF15 are further increased in obese patients after
bariatric surgery (27).
Previous studies have demonstrated a widespread hindbrain ac-
tivation of c-FOS upon GDF15 administration (11), encompassing not
only the AP but also the dorsal motor nu-
cleus of the vagus and the nucleus of the
solitary tract (11). Here, we detected c-FOS
activation in the AP at the high dose only
but did not observe consistent activation
of the nucleus of the solitary tract. How-
ever, given the robust effects of GDF15 on
metabolic parameters observed at lower
doses, the lack of c-FOS signal is most like-
ly due to low sensitivity of our immuno-
histochemical procedure. An earlier study
showed evidence of c-FOS activation reach-
ing into hypothalamic areas as well (12).
This activation could be a result of both
neuronal and humoral stimuli affect-
ing the AP and surrounding structures.
Amylin, another secreted protein that re-
duces gastric emptying, has also been sug-
gested to work through the AP (28). Here,
activation of AP neurons causes activation
of hypothalamic areas involved in food
intake and energy homeostasis (29). A
complex network of neuronal activation
that slows gastric emptying and induces
satiety may be an underlying mechanism
of GDF15.
Limitations associated with the devel-
opment of any GDF15 therapeutic involve
a lack of understanding of the relation-
ship of GDF15 to its receptor and tissue
localization of that receptor. In the basal
state, GDF15 is found in the circulation in
very low amounts; however, GDF15 con-
centrations increase in several types of can-
cer and many other disease states, which
may imply GDF15 resistance (30–32). We
administered doses well above the con-
centrations seen in human circulation, pos-
sibly overcoming any state of resistance.
Knowing and understanding the receptor
of GDF15 and the associated signaling
cascade may help explain GDF15 increases
observed in different disease states. In addition, knowing tissue expres-
sion patterns of a GDF15 receptor could also help identify target-
associated liabilities related to GDF15 receptor activation. It is also
critical to identify and develop more effective and better-tolerated
anti-obesity drugs that will maintain activity for a long period of time.
Using an overexpression system with AAV, we found that hGDF15
decreased body weight for a year, suggesting that GDF15 pharma-
cological treatment could generate durable body weight lowering.
In conclusion, we demonstrated a strong effect of GDF15 in low-
ering body weight in obese mice and monkeys. Use of unconventional
approaches allowed us to engineer long-acting forms of the GDF15
protein that could mimic the large effect size observed with the native
protein in multiple species. We also identified the effects of GDF15 on
gastric emptying, food preference, and AP neuron activities, confirm-
ing the role of GDF15 in the gut-brain axis. Our data support potential
use of GDF15 in the clinic, with properties that could benefit individuals
with obesity and associated metabolic comorbidities.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
A microarray study was conducted to search for genes regulated by
change of energy states. GDF15 was identified as a gene up-regulated
in obesity. We examined the effects of AAV-mediated in vivo over-
expression of GDF15 or daily dosing of rGDF15 protein on obesity and
related metabolic parameters in various disease models. We also solved
GDF15 crystal structure (details in table S2) and generated long-acting
GDF15 molecules using unconventional Fc fusion design. We then
tested the efficacy of weekly dosing with Fc-GDF15 molecules in ro-
dents and nonhuman primates. To further understand the mechanism
of action of GDF15, we conducted a series of rodent studies and ex-
amined the effect of GDF15 on gastric emptying, food preference, and
activation of AP neurons. Investigators who performed rodent and cyn-
omolgus experiments and analyzed the pattern and extent of binding
and tissue pathology were randomly assigned to animals or samples.
Investigators were blinded to the phenotypes of samples from different
groups. For quantitative experiments, individual subject-level data are
shown in table S3.
Animals
All rodent studies were conducted at Amgen Inc. and were approved
by Amgen Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Animals were maintained in rooms with a 12-hour light/dark cycle,
temperature of 22°C, and humidity of 30 to 70%. Animals had free
access to food and water and were maintained on standard rodent
chow unless otherwise indicated.
The cynomolgus monkey efficacy study was conducted at Kunming
Biomed International (KBI). All housing conditions and procedures
were approved by and in compliance with the IACUC of KBI. Work
was conducted under an IACUC-approved protocol in an assessment
and accreditation of laboratory animal care (AALAC)–accredited
facility. Cynomolgus monkeys were individually housed in stainless
steel cages elevated from the floor and adequately sized to promote
species-typical postures and behaviors, with daily environmental
enrichment provided. Animal holding rooms were maintained on a
12-hour light/dark cycle with temperature between 18° and 26°C
and humidity between 40 and 80%.
Human serum samples
Human samples were procured through Bioreclamation. Anonymized
samples were collected after appropriate consent was obtained by
Bioreclamation. Clinical sites contracted by Bioreclamation reviewed
and approved the sample collection protocol. Age-matched obese pa-
tients [body mass index (BMI) > 27; n = 16] and healthy volunteers
(n = 16) were enrolled. Fasting serum samples were collected.
Microarray study
Liver and epididymal fat tissues were collected from 10- to 11-week-old
maleC57BL/6andob/obmice(TheJacksonLaboratory)andsnap-frozen
in liquid nitrogen. Tissue RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen)
and RNeasy kit (QIAGEN). A custom array was built to contain probes
for 4000 computationally annotated potentialsecreted factors, and array
studies were conducted using SureScan microarray scanner (Agilent).
AAV vector generation
To generate the pAAV-GDF15 DNA construct, GDF15 cDNA was in-
serted between an elongation factor 1a promoter and a bovine growth
hormone poly A, and an expression cassette was flanked by inverted
terminal repeats of AAV. Recombinant AAV (rAAV) was produced by
triple transfection of suspension-adapted human embryonic kidney–
293 T cells, as previously described (33).
Cells from a 1-liter Erlenmeyer flask (corresponding to 0.8 × 109
cells) were collected, resuspended in 8 ml of serum-free Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium, and lysed by three rounds of freezing and
thawing. Before application onto an AVB Sepharose (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences) column, the lysate containing the rAAV vector was trea-
ted as previously described (34). The filtered lysate containing rAAV
vectors was then loaded onto an AVB Sepharose column and eluted
with glycine HCl (pH 3.0). The eluted rAAV vector was immedi-
ately neutralized with 1 M tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and dialyzed against
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)–MK buffer (PBS with 1 mM MgCl2
and 2.5 mM KCl). Purified rAAV vectors were then concentrated in
the dialysis cassette with Slide-A-Lyzer Concentrating Solution (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Purified rAAV vectors were titered using QuickTiter
AAV Quantitation Kit (Cell Biolabs Inc.).
AAV injection
Six-month-old male B6D2F1 DIO mice (100006, The Jackson Labo-
ratory) were started at 6 weeks of age and maintained on 60% high-fat
diet (D12492, Research Diets Inc.); 7- to 8-week-old male ob/ob mice
(000632, The Jackson Laboratory), 11- to 12-week-old male KKAy
mice (002468, The Jackson Laboratory), and 8- to 9-week-old male db/db
mice (000642, The Jackson Laboratory) were used in the AAV studies.
Three to 4 days before AAV injection, animals were sorted by body
weight, whole-blood glucose, serum insulin, triglyceride, and choles-
terol concentrations for each treatment group to have similar baselines.
Tail vein blood samples for this analysis were collected in DIO mice
after 4 hours of fasting and in ob/ob, KKAy, and db/db mice after 1 hour
of acclimation to the procedure room with free access to food. AAV
was diluted in saline to 8 × 1012 genomic units/ml, and 100 ml was in-
jected through the tail vein for each animal.
Body mass composition and bone mineral
density measurements
Body mass composition (fat mass and lean mass) and bone mineral den-
sity were measured using a Lunar PIXImus DEXA device (PIXImus).
GDF15 and insulin ELISA
Serum GDF15 concentrations were measured using a mouse/rat GDF15
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a human GDF15
ELISA kit (R&D Systems). In rodent studies, serum insulin concen-
trations were measured using a high range mouse insulin ELISA kit
(ALPCO) or rat insulin ELISA kit (ALPCO). In cynomolgus monkey
studies, serum insulin concentrations were measured using Roche
cobas e411 automatic clinical analyzer.
Glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol measurements
In rodent studies, blood glucose concentrations were measured using
an AlphaTRAK 2 glucose strip (Abbott Diagnostics), serum triglyceride
using a triglyceride quantitation kit (Sigma-Aldrich), and serum choles-
terol using a cholesterol quantitation kit (Sigma-Aldrich). In cynomolgus
monkey studies, plasma glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol concentra-
tions were measured using Roche cobas c311 automatic clinical analyzer.
Recombinant GDF15 protein
GDF15 is expressed in BL21DE3 cells as inclusion bodies, which were
solubilized in 6 M guanidine and refolded in 20% glycerol, 0.15 M

 arginine HCl, 50 mM tris (pH 8.5), and 4 mM cysteine/cystamine for
4 days at 4°C. The refolded GDF15 proteins were purified on HiPrep
DEAE FF 16/10 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) anion exchange col-
umn, a Superdex 200 16/600 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) size ex-
clusion column, and a C4 protein reverse-phase column (Vydac).
GDF15 antibody production
C57BL/6 mice were immunized with the mGDF15 DNA construct
and boosted with T cell epitope–conjugated mGDF15 protein. Immu-
nized animals with high serum titers were sacrificed, and B cells were
harvested from spleens and lymph nodes and fused with SP2/0 mye-
loma to generate hybridomas. Conditioned medium was screened for
GDF15 binding affinity using ELISA. For the high-affinity binding
antibodies, concentrated conditioned medium from hybridomas cul-
tured to exhaustion was further purified through protein A/G affinity
columns for epitope binning and affinity binding Biacore assays. Se-
lected high-affinity hybridoma lines were subcloned to generate mono-
clonal hybridomas. A conditioned medium of a large-scale monoclonal
hybridoma culture was purified for activity measurement.
Crystal structure
GDF15 protein was polished on a Supderdex G75 16/600 column
equilibrated with a crystallization buffer [25 mM sodium acetate
(pH 4.6) and 100 mM sodium chloride]. The peak fractions were
pooled and concentrated to 1 mg/ml and screened against commercial
high-throughput crystallization kits. GDF15 was crystallized using a
sitting drop vapor diffusion method with the well solution contain-
ing 15% (w/v) tascimate (pH 7.0), 0.1 M Hepes (pH 7.0), and 2% poly-
ethylene glycol 3350. For data collection, a single crystal was transferred
to a cryoprotection solution containing the well solution supplemented
with 25% ethylene glycol and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Data collection and structure solution
The x-ray diffraction data sets were collected by synchrotron beamline
08ID at Canadian Light Source, processed using MOSFLM, and scaled
using SCALA in CCP4 package (35). The structure was solved by mo-
lecular replacement method using program PHASER with the BMP6
monomer as a search model (Protein Data Bank access code: 2R52)
(36). Model building was carried out in COOT (37), and structure re-
finement was carried out with REFMAC5 (38) in CCP4 package. The
figures were prepared using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics
System; Schrödinger LLC).
Fc fusion GDF15 proteins
Stable expression of Fc fusion molecules was completed by transfec-
tion in CHO-K1 host cells followed by puromycin/hygromycin anti-
biotic selection. Protein expression was carried out over 6 to 7 days.
Conditioned medium was then directly loaded on to a MabSelect Sure
column (GE Healthcare) and eluted using sodium acetate. The con-
ditioned elution pool was purified using an SP-Sepharose HP column
followed by a Superdex 200 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) and then
formulated in 10 mM sodium acetate, 0.9% sucrose, and 0.005% poly-
sorbate 80.
Ob/ob mice food intake assay
Six- to 7-week-old male ob/ob mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were
sorted into different treatment groups, with each group having com-
parable pretreatment body weight and food intake. Animals were
treated with different doses of proteins through subcutaneous injec-
tion, and food intake was measured for 20 to 22 hours. In studies
using mGDF15 antibodies, animals were treated with GDF15 anti-
bodies or control antibodies through subcutaneous injection 24 hours
before rmGDF15 injection.
Chronic treatment in DIO mice
Chronic treatment studies were conducted with 19- to 20-week-old
male C57BL/6 DIO mice (Taconic Biosciences) and maintained on
60% high-fat diet (Research Diets Inc.) from 6 weeks of age. Animals
were acclimated to the dosing regimen by subcutaneous saline in-
jection for 2 weeks. After acclimation, animals were sorted into treat-
ment groups, with each group having comparable baseline body
weight and 4-hour fasting whole-blood glucose and serum insulin, tri-
glyceride, and cholesterol concentrations. Body weight and food intake
were measured on days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 34. Four-hour fasting blood
samples were collected at days 14 and 28, and overnight fasting blood
samples were collected on day 35 after the first treatment. OGTTs
(20% glucose, 10 ml/kg) were conducted on days 14 and 35 after blood
sampling.
Efficacy studies in cynomolgus monkeys
Naïve male spontaneously obese cynomolgus monkeys with a BMI
(>41 kg/m2) were prescreened for health. Cynomolgus monkeys were
acclimated to single housing, experimental procedures, and handling
for 6 weeks before treatment. During this acclimation period, plasma
samples were collected from animals that fasted overnight (5:00 p.m.
to 7:00 a.m.) for glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and total cholesterol mea-
surements; a baseline OGTT (see procedure below) was conducted as
well. Cynomolgus monkeys were randomized into two intravenous-
treated groups receiving either vehicle (n = 10) or rhGDF15 (n = 10;
0.5 mg/kg) daily for 39 days (days 0 to 38), and three subcutaneously
treated groups receiving either vehicle (n = 10), ScFc (n = 10; 1.5 mg/kg),
or DhCpmFc (n = 10; 1.5 mg/kg) once weekly for 6 weeks (days 0,
7, 14, 21, 28, and 35). The randomization assured comparable baseline
values for each of the characteristics. To minimize stress, cynomolgus
monkeys receiving subcutaneous injections were held in separate
holding rooms from cynomolgus monkeys receiving intravenous in-
jections for the entire study (acclimation, treatment, and washout). A
5-week recovery and washout period followed the ~6-week treatment
period. Overnight fasting (5:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) blood samples were
collected at predose days −24, −17, and −10, as well as on days 6, 13,
20, 27, 34, and 41 (6 days after each weekly dose) during the treatment
phase. During the washout phase, blood samples were collected on
days 48, 55, 62, 69, and 76.
A total of four OGTTs were performed, including during baseline
(day −17), week 2 (day 13) and week 5 (day 34) of the treatment
phase, and week 8 (day 55) of the washout phase. After overnight fast-
ing (5:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.), monkeys going through OGTT were moved
to the procedure room the morning of the challenge and secured in
specially designed restraint chairs. Monkeys were alert/conscious and
remained in restraint chairs for the entire OGTT procedure.
Plasma was collected 3 min before D-glucose oral gavage. Monkeys
then received an oral gavage of freshly prepared 40% D-glucose (Sigma-
Aldrich) solution at 4 g/kg (10 ml/kg dose volume) via nasogastric
tube followed by 5 ml of saline flush. Timer was started at the end of
the saline flush. Plasma samples were subsequently collected at 15, 30,
60, 120, and 180 min after the glucose administration. Monkeys were
fed normal morning food rations after returning to cages in their
home room after completion of the OGTT.

 Body weight was measured once a week (before the morning meal),
and food intake was monitored daily for each monkey throughout
the study. Each monkey received unlimited food for a limited amount
of time (1 hour) at the morning and evening feedings, about 8 hours
apart. A 150-g apple snack, for a limited amount of time (1 hour), was
provided between meals. The remaining food or apple was removed
and weighed after each meal or snack to calculate food intake. Blood
samples for determination of the drug concentration-time profile
were collected throughout the treatment phase and washout phase
(same points as shown above for blood chemistry determination).
Plasma was analyzed for drug concentrations using ELISA. Cyno-
molgus monkeys suspected of having developed anti-GDF15 anti-
bodies (n = 5 for ScFc and n = 2 for DhCpmFc) as evidenced by
rapid clearance and an altered PK profile were excluded from data
analysis.
Chronic treatment in Zucker fatty rats
Chronic treatment studies were conducted with 11-week-old male
Zucker fatty rats (Charles River Laboratories) maintained on stan-
dard rodent chow (Teklad 2020 global diets, Envigo). Animals were
acclimated to the dosing regimen by subcutaneous saline injection for
2 weeks. After acclimation, animals were sorted into treatment groups,
with each group having comparable baseline body weight and 4-hour
fasting whole-blood glucose and serum insulin, triglyceride, and cho-
lesterol concentrations. Body weight and food intake were measured
on days 5, 12, 19, 26, and 33. Four-hour fasting blood samples were col-
lected on days 12 and 26, and overnight fasting blood samples were col-
lected on day 35. OGTTs (20% glucose, 10 ml/kg) were conducted on
days 12 and 35 after blood sampling.
Gastric emptying
Eight- to 9-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were fasted overnight and
sorted into treatment groups, with each group having comparable
body weight. RhGDF15 protein was injected 30 min before oral ad-
ministration of 0.05% phenol red solution (1 mg/kg). Animals were
euthanized by decapitation at 5, 15, or 30 min after administration
of phenol red solution. The stomach was quickly ligated at the esoph-
ageal sphincter and the pyloric sphincter. The stomach was
dissected and homogenized for 30 s in 8 ml of 0.1 N sodium hydrox-
ide. 0.3 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid was added to the homogenate.
The mixture was briefly vortexed and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20
min. After centrifugation, 2 ml of the supernatant was collected and
mixed with 0.2 ml of 4 N sodium hydroxide. Samples (200 ml) were
transferred to a 96-well plate and read at optical density OD560 using
a plate reader (Molecular Devices). A group of animals was sacrificed
immediately after oral gavage of 0.05% phenol red solution; the phenol
red reading of this group was used as 100% to calculate gastric empty-
ing rate for the other groups of mice.
Food preference
Nine-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River Labora-
tories) were single housed and provided daily with 60 g of standard
rodent chow (Teklad 2020 global diets, Envigo) on one side of the
wire cage top and 60 g of condensed milk chow (D12266B, Re-
search Diets) on another side of the wire cage top. Fresh food was
provided daily. Food intake was measured daily for 7 days to establish
baseline and measured 1 day after GDF15 injection. Two groups of
animals provided with 120 g of each type of food daily were used as
controls.
c-FOS experiment
Male C57/B6 mice (n = 4 per group; Charles River Laboratories)
were dosed intraperitoneally with amylin (25 mg/kg) (Bachem),
or hGDF15 (1 or 10 mg/kg) or vehicle [5 mM sodium acetate
buffer (pH 4.5)]. Thirty min after injection, mice were terminally
anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of Fatal Plus (100 mg/kg)
(Western Medical Supply Inc.) and perfused with PBS followed by
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were postfixed in 4% para-
formaldehyde in PBS overnight and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose.
Tissue sections (30 mm) were processed using a commercial kit
(PerkinElmer Life Science) based on tyramide signal amplification
with rabbit polyclonal anti–c-FOS antibody (sc-52, Cisbio) and
1:800 biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories Inc.).
Biodistribution experiment
Male C57/B6 mice (Charles River Laboratories) weighing 21 to 22 g
were dosed in a blinded fashion via the tail vein with GDF15-Fc
(10 mg/kg), human control Fc in buffer [5 mM sodium acetate (pH
4.5)], or vehicle [5 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5)] (n = 3 per group).
Mice were sacrificed either 2 hours (n = 1 per group) or 4 days (n = 2
per group) after injection. Blood was collected from the tail vein and
then mice were perfused for immunohistochemistry as described
above. Tissue sections (12 mm) were incubated with goat anti-human
Fc antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by 1:500 Alexa Fluor 488 don-
key anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen). Double labeling was performed by
co-incubation with rabbit anti-PGP9.5 (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by
co-incubation with Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-rabbit IgG.
Statistical analysis
All data are means ± SEM. Comparison of statistical difference be-
tween two experimental groups was determined by unpaired t test.
For statistical analysis of rodent experiments with more than two
treated groups, ANOVA was performed, followed by Dunnett’s
multiple comparison test. For statistical analysis of cynomolgus ex-
periment: All data are means ± SEM. CAST-MD Application using
SAS version 9.2 on a Linux system was used. Blood chemistry para-
meters were log-transformed before statistical analysis. The statis-
tical analysis on parameters with baseline values was performed at
each assessment separately using ANCOVA with the baseline value
as the covariate. For both ANCOVA variations, homogeneous and
heterogeneous models were fit using PROC MIXED, and the final
model was selected on the basis of the lowest Akaike Information
Criterion for finite sample sizes. In the event of nonconvergence,
Levene’s test was used to assess homogeneity. If required, then a
nonparametric rank-based ANCOVA was applied. Baseline by
group interaction terms was included in the ANCOVA model for
a given parameter if it was found to be statistically significant (P <
0.05) in greater than 30% of assessment models for that parameter.
