Background: No study has previously analyzed aggressiveness, homicide, and Lyme 
disease (LD).
Materials and methods: Retrospective LD chart reviews analyzed aggressiveness, compared 
50 homicidal with 50 non-homicidal patients, and analyzed homicides.
Results: Most aggression with LD was impulsive, sometimes provoked by intrusive symptoms, 
sensory stimulation or frustration and was invariably bizarre and senseless. About 9.6% of LD 
patients were homicidal with the average diagnosis delay of 9 years. Postinfection findings 
associated with homicidality that separated from the non-homicidal group within the 
95% confidence interval included suicidality, sudden abrupt mood swings, explosive anger, 
paranoia, anhedonia, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle, disinhibition, nightmares, depersonal-
ization, intrusive aggressive images, dissociative episodes, derealization, intrusive sexual images, 
marital/family problems, legal problems, substance abuse, depression, panic disorder, memory 
impairments, neuropathy, cranial nerve symptoms, and decreased libido. Seven LD homicides 
included predatory aggression, poor impulse control, and psychosis. Some patients have selective 
hyperacusis to mouth sounds, which I propose may be the result of brain dysfunction causing 
a disinhibition of a primitive fear of oral predation.
Conclusion: LD and the immune, biochemical, neurotransmitter, and the neural circuit reactions 
to it can cause impairments associated with violence. Many LD patients have no aggressiveness 
tendencies or only mild degrees of low frustration tolerance and irritability and pose no danger; 
however, a lesser number experience explosive anger, a lesser number experience homicidal 
thoughts and impulses, and much lesser number commit homicides. Since such large numbers 
are affected by LD, this small percent can be highly significant. Much of the violence associated 
with LD can be avoided with better prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of LD.
Keywords: Borrelia burgdorferi, impulsive, tick-borne, rage, suicide, immune
Plain language summary
This study was performed because a recent study on Lyme disease (LD) and suicide showed 
26% of suicidal patients with late stage LD were also homicidal. Violence and homicide rarely 
have a single cause, instead there are many contributors, deterrents, and acute triggers. Many 
infections and the immune reactions to them can be associated with violence, including those 
transmitted by ticks, lice, mosquitos, and so on. The evidence supporting the association between 
infections and violence is from evolutionary concepts, epidemiology, historical perspectives, 
case reports, animal studies, brain chemistry, brain immunology, brain circuits, and medical 
literature review. In this study, inactive charts of Lyme patients were reviewed and analyzed for 
aggressiveness, homicidality, and homicide. Most aggression in these patients was associated 
with poor impulse control, sometimes triggered by intrusive images, thoughts and emotions; 
sound or other stimulation and frustration, and the resulting aggression was invariably bizarre and 
senseless. In this study of homicidal Lyme patients, it was found that the average patient diagnosis

was delayed by 9 years. Lyme infections caused a broad spectrum 
of clinical findings identified in this study that can collectively be 
associated with homicidality. A large number of patients with LD 
have no aggressive tendencies or only mild degrees of low frustra-
tion tolerance and irritability, pose no danger to society, and should 
not be stigmatized. This study can help explain and prevent some 
previously unexplainable violence and homicide and has broader 
implications. Understanding the role of Lyme and other infections 
in causing violence, and prevention, diagnosis, and treatment can 
help reduce some violence and promote peace.
Introduction
Background
Lyme disease (LD) is the most common tick-borne disease, 
which is a spirochete, and LD has been compared to syphilis 
and labeled the New Great Imitator since it may present as 
many different medical conditions.1,2 The Lyme Borrelia has 
been found in 15 million-year-old fossilized ticks and in the 
5,300-year-old Iceman in the Italian Alps.3,4 LD is transmitted 
by Ixodes ticks and is the most common tick-borne disease.5 
Although Ixodes ticks and Borrelia are present throughout 
the world, there are regional differences in Borrelia species, 
tick populations, tick-borne coinfections, and infection rates. 
In the past 30 years, there has been an expanding awareness of 
a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms that invari-
ably evolve in the later stages of these infections and may 
include cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms. The 
diagnosis of LD is often overlooked, and it is increasingly 
common for psychiatrists to make the initial diagnosis.6–11
LD, or Lyme borreliosis, is a tick-borne infectious disease 
caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia garinii, or Borrelia 
afzelii while the term Lyme borreliosis/tick-borne diseases 
recognize that there may also be other tick-borne pathogens 
and secondary opportunistic infections causing a complex 
pathophysiological process.
No study has ever before attempted to examine the 
association between aggressiveness, violence, homicidality, 
homicide, and LD. A recent article on suicide and Lyme 
and associated diseases revealed that 68% of LD patients 
acquired some form of aggressiveness, including 11% who 
became homicidal after infection, and 26% of the suicidal 
patients were also homicidal.12 Based upon this finding, a 
further assessment of aggression and homicidality in LD 
patients was indicated.
Currently there is a tendency to deal with aggressive-
ness more through punitive approaches rather than scientific 
understanding and proactive prevention. Weapon technology 
is more advanced than our capability to understand and 
prevent violence, and this limitation is a serious concern 
when atomic and other weapons of mass destruction may be 
in the hands of individuals or groups at risk for violent 
behavior. Therefore, every contributor to violence needs to 
be better understood and addressed.
Defining aggression and violence
The word aggression may refer to either healthy adaptive 
emotional effort or more commonly violent maladaptive 
behavior. Healthy adaptive aggression exists throughout the 
animal kingdom and is an integral part of human behavior. 
It includes the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness and the 
drives for territoriality, social integration, and reproduction. 
Social cooperation and respectful competition are an integral 
part of adaptive aggression and healthy human and societal 
functioning. A healthy individual in a healthy society values 
social cooperation and respectful competition over violence 
as a means of achieving goals.
Anger is an emotion characterized by antagonism toward 
someone, oneself, or something. Violence can be defined as 
the use of physical force, power, or threat with the intent 
to harm or injure another person, oneself, or a group or 
community, or the destruction of property. Rage is violent, 
uncontrolled anger. Characteristics of violent acts include 
self-directed violence (suicidal behavior and self-abuse), 
interpersonal violence (family – child, partner, elder, or 
community – acquaintance, and stranger), and collective 
violence (social, political, and economic). The nature of 
violent acts can include physical, sexual, psychological, and 
involving deprivation or neglect.13 Sometimes aggression is 
used as a synonym for violence. Homicide is the act of one 
human killing another.
contributors, deterrents, and triggers of 
violence
It can rarely be stated that there is only one single cause in 
any given violent act. Violent behavior is the result of an 
interaction of multiple contributors, deterrents, acute triggers, 
and many different sequential events, some of which are both 
known and unknown (Figure 1).
Some of the well-recognized contributors to violence 
include homelessness, social isolation, being single, living 
alone, gang membership, low education, unemployment, 
incarceration, history of violent behavior, fascination with 
weapons, being a victim of violence, opposing beliefs (reli-
gious, political, ethnic, and lifestyle), exposure to violence, 
exposure to media and computer games with violent themes,

younger age, intoxication of potential victim, response of the 
potential victim, gender, genes (monoamine oxidase A, cate-
chol-O-methyltransferase, serotonin transporter gene, FK506 
binding protein s, XYY), threat sensitivity, grudge holding, 
victim blaming, childhood abuse, child conduct disorder, 
multiple psychiatric diagnoses (intermittent explosive disor-
der, narcissistic personality disorder, antisocial personality 
disorder, psychopathy, bipolar illness, depression, social com-
munication disorder, and other conditions), longer duration 
of untreated psychosis, cognitive dysfunction, treatment non-
adherence, substance abuse, cannabis use, intoxication, head 
injuries, toxicity, endocrine disorders, limbic encephalitis, 
Wilson’s disease, brain infections, brain tumors, neurological 
impairments, and sensory and motor impairments.14–18 One 
hundred percent of death row inmates had both neurological 
impairments and a history of abuse.19–21
Deterrents to violence include empathy, frustration 
tolerance, cognitive abilities, restraint capabilities, higher 
education, coping skills, supportive relationships, community 
and other social connections, ethical and religious beliefs, 
access to social services and psychiatric and medical care, 
and social structure.22
Triggering events can include acute stress, apperception 
of threat, jealousy, obsession, psychotic delusions, post-
traumatic flashbacks, hopelessness, competition, exposure 
to violence, traumatic brain injury, unintentional injury, 
being suicidal, self-harm, impairment from substance use, 
intoxication, and losing a parent.23,24
While acknowledging the significance of all of these 
other components to violence, the scope of this article shall 
specifically focus upon violence and LD.
epidemiology of violence and infections
Globally, ~1.6 million people die each year because of 
violence.13,25 Currently violence is not equally distributed 
throughout the world.26 Peace correlates strongly with educa-
tion, health, and economic opportunity, and health correlates 
with a lower prevalence of infectious disease.27 Cognitive 
impairments contribute to violence, and higher cognitive 
functioning is a deterrent to violence. There is a strong cor-
relation between national intelligence quotient and lower 
parasite stress. As countries overcome infectious diseases, 
the intelligence of their citizens increases; this helps explain 
the Flynn Effect.28 One study sampled 20 European nations 
and demonstrated that the prevalence of the brain parasite 
Toxoplasma gondii was positively associated with national 
homicide rates.29,30

it was estimated that 10% died because of homicide. 
Throughout history, violence has decreased as civilization 
has advanced with increases in literacy, education, demo-
cratic governments, and health.31 Different parts of the world 
at different times in history had different rates of violence 
in individuals and groups. Poor hygiene correlates with a 
higher rate of infectious diseases, which in turn correlates 
with a greater prevalence of violence. The greater prevalence 
of violence in a critical mass of individuals and influential 
individuals may contribute to collective violence and wars 
at different times in history.32
Influential leaders considered to have mental symptoms 
from syphilis impacting their behavior include Joseph Stalin, 
Adolf Hitler, Ivan the Terrible, Idi Amin Dada, Benito 
Mussolini, Henry VIII, Al Capone, Napoleon Bonaparte, 
Vladimir Lenin, Pope Alexander VI, Charles VIII of France, 
Peter the Great, and Catherine the Great.33–36
Types of violence
Two basic types of violence are individual violence and col-
lective or group violence. Individual violence involves one 
person directing violence against others. Collective or group 
violence is acts committed by normal people and includes 
situational collective violence which is unplanned and spon-
taneous, organized collective violence that is unofficial and 
lacking government approval, and institutional collective 
violence which is directed by legally constituted officials.
Individual violence can be categorized into three major 
types – impulsive (or affective), psychotic, and predatory (or 
psychopathic). Some individual violent acts may be a combina-
tion of more than one of these categories. Impulsive violence, 
also called disorders of impulse control or affective violence 
is reactive, emotional, rapid and unplanned in response to a 
real or perceived perception of threat with intense autonomic 
arousal without regard for long-term consequences. Psychotic 
violence is motivated by a persecution belief, and there may 
be an attack against imagined enemies. Paranoia, paranoid 
schizophrenia, and drug-induced paranoid states are included 
in this category. Predatory violence is planned, purposeful, and 
emotionless without autonomic arousal. Impaired function-
ing contributes to violence in all the three categories, which 
include impairments of cognition, threat perception, autonomic 
arousal, impulse control, empathy, and reality testing.14,37
The characteristics of violent acts include self-directed 
violence and interpersonal violence. Self-directed violence 
can include suicidal behavior and self-abuse. Interpersonal 
violence can include family and intimate partner violence 
(child, partner, and elder), community violence (acquaintance 
and stranger), and collective violence (social, political, and 
economic). The nature of violent acts includes physical, 
sexual, psychological, and/or involving deprivation or 
neglect.13,38
Impaired and violent individuals or groups of impaired 
and violent individuals may also contribute to causing col-
lective violence on others who are normal healthy individuals 
if these impaired individuals are in positions of leadership 
or influence upon other normal healthy individuals. Leaders 
or influential individuals prone to predatory violence are 
particularly dangerous which may result in genocide.32
Neural circuitry of violence
Although a detailed review of all the known neural circuits 
and transmitters involved in violence is beyond the scope of 
this article, some general concepts deserve attention. In a state 
of health, higher level cortical and limbic functioning has 
sufficient control over more primitive limbic and hypotha-
lamic functioning. Higher level brain functioning integrates 
many feedforward and feedback pathways that are both 
stimulatory and inhibitory. Injury to a higher center can result 
in a dysfunction or a loss of a function leading to a decline in 
adaptive abilities. Injury to an inhibiting pathway will cause 
a decline or an inability to inhibit that function. In individuals 
prone to violence, higher level neural circuits associated with 
civilized behavior have insufficient control over more primi-
tive mammalian and reptilian neural circuits.39
The right ventromedial prefrontal cortex integrates cogni-
tion and affect which contributes to mediating the empathic 
response.40 The orbital frontal cortex contributes to constrain-
ing impulsive outbursts, while the anterior cingulate cortex 
recruits other brain regions in the response to conflict. Parts 
of the amygdala are involved in the production of a fear 
response and other negative emotions. Other parts of the 
amygdala recognize fear, social emotions, and multiple other 
emotions in facial expressions as demonstrated by impaired 
recognition of emotions of social significance following 
amygdala damage.41,42
In impulsive violence, cortical functioning generally 
has insufficient control over lower level functioning. This 
failure of the prefrontal cortex to modulate aggressive acts 
triggered by anger-provoking stimuli combined with a hyper-
responsive amygdala and other limbic regions that are part 
of affective reactivity contributes to impulsive violence.43 
Brain activity in the orbital and anterior regions (impulse 
control) were blunted or entirely absent in many violent 
offenders, while the amygdala (fear) showed normal or 
heightened activity. The inability of the two brain regions to 
effectively balance the response of the amygdala may help 
explain how threatening situations can become explosive

aggressiveness, violence, homicidality, homicide, and lyme disease
in some people.44 Brain imaging in murderers supports this 
model and demonstrates reduced activity in the prefrontal 
cortex as well as the superior parietal cortex, left angular 
gyrus, and corpus callosum.45
In psychotic aggression, there is also a hypoactive prefrontal 
cortex but in contrast to impulsive violence there is invariably 
normal limbic drive and striatal hyperactivity.14,46 In predatory 
aggression, there is also a hypoactive prefrontal cortex, but 
instead a hypoactive limbic system and amygdala.14,46
Particularly violence is correlated with intrusive symp-
toms, which is relevant to impulsive, predatory, and psychotic 
aggression. The neural circuit relevant to these symptoms 
are associated with the activation of basolateral amygdala 
and ventral hippocampus.47–50 Activation of this circuit also 
seems to be associated with chronic inflammation with 
elevated inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, 
interleuken-6, interleukin-1β, and C-reactive protein).51–53 
LD is associated with chronic inflammation and activation 
of this circuit.54
Neurochemistry of violence
The neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, 
acetylcholine, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid are 
thought to be involved in violent behavior.14 Particularly sero-
tonin is significant.55–57 Impulsively violent individuals have 
decreased serotonin activity as demonstrated by significantly 
lower concentrations of the major metabolite of serotonin, 
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, in their cerebrospinal fluid.58 
Serotonin serves an important inhibitory function in the 
amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex.59
Inflammatory markers are elevated in individuals with 
intermittent explosive disorder. Elevations of both plasma 
C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels were significantly 
elevated in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder 
compared with psychiatric or normal controls. In addition, 
these inflammatory markers were directly correlated with a 
composite measure of aggression and with measures reflecting 
history of actual aggressive behavior in all individuals.60
Persistence of inflammation is associated with persistent 
elevations of proinflammatory cytokines, which results in 
the dysregulation of tryptophan metabolism, that increases 
quinolinic acid, which is a N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 
agonist and this can result in glutamate dysfunction and 
violent behavior.12
Violence and infections
Violent behavior has been associated with a number of infec-
tious diseases including Spanish flu, encephalitis lethargica, 
Western equine encephalitis, viral encephalitis, herpes sim-
plex encephalitis, neurosyphilis, cerebral malaria, sepsis, and 
toxoplasmosis.61–76 In a review of 108 cases of acute viral 
encephalitis, 23% experienced violence or aggression.77 
Criminal behavior as a result of neurological injury has been 
documented in both acute and chronic infections including 
neurosyphilis, encephalitis lethargica, herpes simplex 
encephalitis, AIDS dementia complex, infections causing 
dementia, and various other viral encephalitides.78–81
T. gondii seropositive individuals have higher aggression 
and impulsivity scores, which suggests T. gondii changes 
brain chemistry in a fashion that increases the risk of aggres-
sive behavior. The personality of men infected with T. gondii 
showed higher apprehension compared to uninfected con-
trols, lower superego strength, and higher vigilance, they 
were more likely to disregard rules, and were more expedient, 
suspicious, jealous, and dogmatic. Possible mechanisms by 
which T. gondii may affect human behavior include its effect 
on dopamine and on testosterone.82
Parasitic infections have adverse effects throughout life, 
but are particularly traumatic to the young. Newborn children 
need 87% of their metabolic energy for brain functioning, 
while the brains of 5-year-old children consume 87% of their 
metabolic energy and an adult brain requires approximately 
a quarter of the body’s energy. In addition to the pathogenic 
effects of parasites, they also compete for energy which can 
harm brain development and functioning, which can in turn 
contribute to violent behavior.28
Violence and infectious diseases in 
animals
Parasites sometimes manipulate the behavior of hosts in 
a manner that facilitates their survival and reproduction.83 
Sometimes this manipulation includes fostering aggressive 
behavior.84,85 Historically, rabies has been the main model 
for infections causing violence in animals.86 In addition, 
aggression associated with tick-borne infections in animals 
has been documented with Babesia microti in mice,87 Babesia 
gibsoni in dogs,88 B. burgdorferi in dogs,89,90 Bartonella 
henselae in dogs,91 B. henselae in horses,92 and B. burgdorferi 
in chimpanzees.93,94
In order to study the neuroendocrine effects, work has 
been done with prairie voles and dogs to understand aggres-
siveness in animals with selective aggression versus affilia-
tion and bonding in the context of arginine-vasopressin versus 
oxytocin.95–97 Both the neuropeptides are significant in social 
behavior, but oxytocin is more associated with affiliation 
while arginine-vasopressin is more associated with aggression 
and male behavior.98 In sheep, increased oxytocin results in

maternal acceptance while lower levels may result in violent 
rejection and indifference toward a newborn.99 In humans, 
low oxytocin levels are associated with alexithymia and 
anorexia nervosa.100 Arginine-vasopressin and oxytocin 
are released from the posterior pituitary gland, a part of the 
brain lacking a blood–brain barrier and more vulnerable to 
penetration by B. burgdorferi which has been demonstrated 
in the vasculature in a murine model.101–104
Murine and primate models demonstrated infection of 
the trigeminal nerve is a transneuronal entry route for brain 
infections involving temporal lobe and limbic structures.22,105
Violence and lD
More serious cases often involve a complex interactive infec-
tion with Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne coinfections 
and sometimes the activation of opportunistic viruses and 
other pathogens. A survey of over 3,000 chronic LD patients 
demonstrated that over 50% had laboratory-confirmed 
coinfections and 30% had two or more coinfections, includ-
ing Babesia (32%), Bartonella (28%), Ehrlichia (15%), 
Mycoplasma (15%), Rickettsia rickettsia (6%), Anaplasma 
(5%), and Francisella tularemia (1%). A very similar study 
of chronic Lyme patients in Canada demonstrated similar 
coinfection rates.106,107 Although some tick studies show that 
coinfection rates are relatively low, these findings can be 
explained since chronically ill patients often report exposure 
to multiple tick bites.
The first human reference to aggressiveness with tick-
borne diseases that could be located was a 1990 study by 
Logigian et al demonstrating that 26% of chronic Lyme 
patients had extreme irritability.108 In 1991, Harvey et al 
described a patient who became aggressive and combative 
following a Bartonella infection.109 The first reference to 
homicide associated with LD was a meatpacker who killed 
his supervisor at a meat-packing plant in Michigan in 1992 
and used LD as part of the defense. His identical twin who 
did not have LD had no neurological deficits or history of 
violence.110 In 1992, Fallon et al described a man acutely 
sensitive to sound who was so intensely bothered by the 
noise of his 3-year-old son that he picked him up and shook 
him in a sudden and unprecedented fit of violence.111 Sherr 
described LD patients having sudden personality changes, 
in people of known character after acquiring LD, including 
outbursts of anger, breaking doors, cursing at other drivers, 
and road rage.112 In a publication, a LD patient described 
an incident where someone else pulled into a parking space 
that he wanted; he responded by jumping out of his car and 
knocking the other driver unconscious. Another LD patient 
was described lunging out of his car after a motorist beeped 
the horn and he began pounding on the windshield of their 
car, then suddenly stopped in bewilderment because he did 
not recall or understand why he was behaving in this man-
ner. Another LD patient was arrested for shoplifting during 
a state of confusion, and another patient was accused of 
pedophilia.113
Other media reports include: a LD patient who stalked, 
threatened to rape, and made repeated threats against multiple 
political candidates;114 a LD patient committed sexual acts 
with his 9-year-old son;115 a LD patient shot at police after a 
911 call;116 a LD patient was charged with assault associated 
with marital conflicts;117 and there have been multiple addi-
tional references to aggressiveness, violence, homicidality, 
and homicide associated with LD.6,9,54,113,118–136
In one presentation, 26 different individuals with LD 
committing multiple violent acts including multiple assaults 
on police officers and 11 homicides were described.137 
Violent behavior seen with LD included homicide; suicide; 
combined homicide and suicide; assaults with a gun, knife, 
sword, axe, hammer, rocks, and darts; assaulting a sibling’s 
head with a rock; pedophilia; stalking; child abuse; assault 
toward teachers and other students; assaults at summer camp; 
self-inflicted injuries; road rage incidents; domestic violence; 
torturing household pets; killing pets; armed robbery; fire 
setting; shoplifting; destroying property with total amnesia 
of the event afterwards; breaking and attempting to break 
automobile windshields; and various forms of public 
lewdness.137
Antibiotic treatment has on occasion provoked aggres-
sive behavior as a result of the Jarisch–Herxheimer 
reaction.111,138 There were a number of homicides associated 
with LD in the press. A LD patient strangled his fiancé with 
a dog leash. He was considered psychotic at the time of 
the homicide by the examining forensic psychiatrist.139,140 
A LD patient bludgeoned his mother to death while she was 
sleeping.141 There was a murder, suicide of a couple with 
advanced LD who also killed the pet dog.142 There was a LD 
homicide in a Shelter Island in which a Lyme patient killed

aggressiveness, violence, homicidality, homicide, and lyme disease
brawl who had no history of abuse; a teenager who became 
involved in physical altercations with peers, parents, and 
teachers; people who never said hell or damn going into a 
rage; children breaking the bones of their sibling, throwing 
a TV set through a window, destroying their bedroom, 
picking fights with classmates; and a teenager who went to 
a neighbor’s house and attacked him with a hammer because 
he thought the neighbor was going into his house. He stated 
he could list hundreds of other similar examples. Noise was 
magnified and certain pitches, a whiney voice, a squeak in a 
gate hinge, a barking dog, a crowd of people’s voices seem 
to bring on irrational behavior (Nostrom SJ, founder and 
director of Lyme borrelia Out-Reach Foundation, personal 
communication, August, 2008).
There were indications the shooter at the Sandy Hook 
Elementary School massacre, Adam Lanza, may have had 
LD, however the medical examiner failed to pursue LD 
assessment.146–148 LD has been a valid defense in the legal 
system.149 LD has been used as a defense in assaults, such as 
detonating a fertilizer bomb and an axe attack.150,151
When discussing homicide associated with LD, it is more 
common to think of a LD patient with a mental impairment 
who kills another person; however, there are other homicides 
associated with LD. In one case, the wife of a debilitated LD 
patient assisted in the planning and implementation of his 
suicide and pleaded guilty to felony murder.152 In reviewing 
other legal cases involving fatalities, LD patients who were 
inadequately diagnosed and treated earlier in their illness 
became debilitated with chronic pain, developed opioid 
dependence and abuse, and died from opioid overdoses.153
In a prior study analyzing the prevalence of findings, 
patients who were both homicidal and suicidal demonstrated 
low frustration tolerance (100%), cognitive symptoms 
(100%), sudden mood swings (93%), generalized anxiety 
(90%), explosive anger (83%), disinhibition (80%), panic 
disorder (80%), paranoia (76%), depersonalization (76%), 
hypervigilance (72%), anhedonia (72%), intrusive images 
(48%), obsessive compulsive disorder (48%), hallucinations 
(45%), substance abuse (28%), posttraumatic stress disor-
der (PTSD) (24%), and dissociative episodes (18%).12 In 
another presentation evaluating children with LD, 53% had 
anger/irritability, 25% had rages/explosive behavior, 54% 
had panic attacks, and 50% had mood swings.154
Neural circuitry of violence and 
infections
Infections and the associated immune provocation can some-
times alter the functioning of cortical, limbic, and brainstem 
functioning. Brain regions and associated circuits particularly 
significant to aggressive potential include the amygdala, the 
right ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex, 
the anterior cingulate, and the ventral hippocampus.53,155,156 
The amygdala is involved in fear responsiveness and other 
negative emotions, the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex 
mediates empathic responsiveness, and. the orbital frontal 
cortex plays a crucial role in constraining impulsive outbursts, 
while the anterior cingulate cortex recruits other brain regions 
in response to conflict, and the basolateral amygdala and ven-
tral hippocampus are significant with traumatic memory.
Infectious encephalopathies are most commonly associ-
ated with impulse control disorders and predominately white 
matter encephalopathies with dysfunction of the prefrontal 
cortex and limbic structures. LD is commonly associated with 
white matter dysfunction, and many patients have explosive 
anger. Intermittent explosive disorder is associated with lower 
white matter integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus 
and density and lower white matter integrity in long-range con-
nections between the frontal and temporoparietal regions.157
A certain type of temporal lobe and amygdala damage is 
strongly associated with predatory aggression in which there is 
impaired recognition of social emotions. This type of aggres-
sion has many similarities to Kluver–Bucy syndrome, which 
is a rare condition associated with temporal lobe injury and 
dysfunction. It includes visual agnosia, excessive oral tenden-
cies, hypermetamorphosis, placidity, altered sexual behavior, 
and changes in dietary habits.158 Psychopathic and serial killers 
display visual agnosia and consistently lack normal empathetic 
human interpersonal recognition, and humans are not human 
to them.159 Kluver–Bucy syndrome is caused by a number of 
conditions including head injuries and a number of infections 
that injure the temporal lobes. These infections include Myco-
plasma pneumoniae, tubercular meningitis, herpes simplex 
encephalitis, herpes meningoencephalitis, tick-borne infec-
tions, Epstein–Barr virus, and neurocysticercosis.160–170
infections and aggression: 
psychoimmunology and neurochemistry
From an evolutionary medicine perspective, zoonotic para-
sites that manipulate the aggressive and social behavior of 
hosts achieve this by altering the actions of serotonin, dop-
amine, and norepinephrine, but in particular serotonin.171 
Persistent infections and the immune reactions to them are 
associated with chronic inflammation and sometime autoim-
mune reactions.
Persistent inflammation is associated with increased 
interleukin-6 and interleukin-1 beta, reduced serotonin as

demonstrated by reduced 5 hydroxy-indoleacetic acid, and 
increased quinolinic acid which is a N-methyl-d-aspartate 
receptor agonist that contributes to glutamate dysregulation 
and can result in both aggressive and self-destructive behavior 
(the death formula).12,172,173 These immune and associated bio-
chemical findings have been seen in a number of infections 
associated with violence, including LD, cerebral malaria, 
and HIV.53,54,174 Other evidence supporting the association 
between inflammation and aggression includes hepatitis C 
treatment with interferon alpha, which can be associated 
with irritability, impulsiveness, hostility, aggression, anger, 
emotional lability, and relapse of substance abuse.175–177
Autoimmune reactions are also associated with aggres-
sion, and they have been seen in cases of pediatric autoim-
mune diseases associated with Streptococcal infections, 
M. pneumoniae and human herpesvirus 7 encephalitis, 
limbic encephalitis, and anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 
encephalitis.178–182
Materials and methods
The author specializes in treating treatment-resistant psychi-
atric illnesses and some of the patient charts include patients 
with LD. A total of 1,000 inactive charts of patients with 
LD from the author’s practice were retrospectively reviewed. 
Three groups of charts were reviewed, and aggregate data 
were collected – of those involving LD and aggressiveness, 
50 homicidal LD subjects were compared with 50 who were 
not homicidal, and charts involving homicide were analyzed 
in more detail.
In the first part of the study, the charts of patients who had 
aggressive thoughts, impulses, and/or behaviors were selected 
and reviewed. These charts were reviewed for documenta-
tion or statements giving insight into the pathophysiology. 
All but two were from the United States.
In the second part of the study, the charts were screened 
until 50 charts of LD patients with homicidality with com-
pleted neuropsychiatric assessments were identified. Fifty 
randomly selected charts of LD patients who were not 
homicidal were selected as a control group. None of these 
control charts were used in the previous study on suicidality, 
and all were from the United States.12 These patients were 
evaluated with a comprehensive assessment including 
premorbid assessment, history of tick exposure, history of 
the presence of erythema migrans rash, early tick-borne 
disease symptoms, symptoms in the course of illness, current 
status with a comprehensive neuropsychiatric and general 
medical assessment, review of systems using the 280-item 
Neuropsychiatric Lyme Assessment with pattern recognition, 
and a review of laboratory assessment, which may include 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescent 
assay, Western blot, DNA-based testing, coinfection testing, 
single-photon emission tomography, magnetic resonance 
imaging, or other diagnostic testing to determine the diagno-
sis in compliance with the Institute of Medicine–recognized 
guidelines.183–187 In addition to diagnostic criteria, the patients 
who met Center for Disease and Prevention surveillance 
criteria were noted, which is more stringent criteria and 
captures ~10% of LD cases.188
Only testing from laboratories validated by the Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments of the US Department 
of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services was considered valid. This is sometimes 
confused with the US FDA clearance for mass marketed test 
kits which does not validate the fundamental accuracy of the 
test but instead demonstrates it is comparable to other similar 
tests that may or may not have been properly validated in the 
first place. Charts in which the diagnosis of LD was unclear 
were excluded from the study. Names were converted to an 
identifier before entering the findings into a database of indi-
vidual participant data. The charts were then reviewed with 
their identity protected to extract aggregate data, including 
findings relevant to homicidality and aggression, and were 
analyzed. The baseline health status of each of these two 
groups before infection was compared with the postinfection 
findings and the clinical findings of the subjects who were 
homicidal were compared with the subjects who were not 
homicidal. Symptoms associated with risk were ranked by 
comparing the prevalence of different findings among the 
two different groups.
Data collection included age, sex, diagnosed by compre-
hensive criteria, Center for Disease Control and Prevention 
surveillance criteria, years before diagnosis and antibiotic 
treatment, coinfections, comorbid conditions, pre-existing 
symptoms before infection, misdiagnoses, number of homi-
cides, attention deficits, auditory hyperacusis, other sensory 
hyperacusis, memory impairments, processing impairments, 
dyslexia symptoms, facial memory, depersonalization, 
derealization, intrusive aggressive images, intrusive sexual 
images, nightmares, hallucinations, executive functioning

mood swings, hypervigilance, paranoia, disinhibition, exag-
gerated startle reflex, explosive anger, suicidal tendencies,

disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, social anxiety dis-
order, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, sleep disorders, 
anhedonia, cranial nerve symptoms, seizures, neuropathy, 
incontinence, decreased libido, irritable bladder, genital pain, 
chronic pain, and intolerance to alcohol.
The data of the impairments were charted and calculated 
to the 95% confidence interval (CI). The total impairments 
of all the 100 patients analyzed was charted preinfection and 
postinfection, and the 95% CI was calculated for each impair-
ment. The incidence of each psychiatric symptom was calcu-
lated for the homicidal versus the non-homicidal groups.
In addition, homicides involving LD were reviewed in 
greater detail and categorized in regard to the type of homi-
cide (impulsive, psychotic, or predatorial), and additional 
information was extracted. All the patients were from the 
United States.
The data were then abstracted to assess the association 
between aggression, violence, and homicide and LD to create 
a model for aggressiveness, violence, and homicidality in LD 
patients to possibly explain and ultimately prevent such an 
association, if it is found.
ethical considerations
The Meridian Health Institutional Review Board, Neptune, 
NJ, USA, approved this study (IRB # 201704192J). Patient 
consent to review their medical records was not required by 
the Institutional Review Board as there was minimal risk to 
subjects, no subject identifiers or links to identifiers were 
used or collected, and it was a retrospective chart review of 
already existing data.
Results
retrospective chart review: 
aggressiveness
A total of 1000 charts of LD patients were screened to identify 
charts documenting aggression. All but two were from the 
US. These charts were then reviewed to identify patterns of 
aggressiveness. This part of the study was not a statistical 
analysis of frequency, dominance, or general occurrence of 
the behaviors discussed.
The most commonly reported aggression with LD was 
impulsive, sometimes provoked by intrusive symptoms, sen-
sory stimulation or frustration and was invariably bizarre and 
senseless. Aggression occurred both in homes and in public 
settings. Some of the aggressive patients had temporal lobe 
dysfunction, sometimes accompanied with partial seizures. 
Acute episodes of rage, sometimes referred to as “Lyme rage,” 
were reported and were witnessed on multiple occasions. The 
anger during these episodes had a very abrupt onset and was 
extremely intense and often with minimal cognitive control.
Patients described horrific intrusive symptoms. At night, 
they would take the form of vivid nightmares. During the 
day, these intrusive symptoms could be intrusive images, 
thoughts, and/or impulses. A typical description is that these 
intrusive symptoms include descriptions of frightening, 
stabbing, horrific images, usually of death, dying, or pain and 
suffering. They could be gory and unreal as in a horror story with 
faces with blood or terror exaggerated, awful expressions. They 
are described as people in the worse possible situation, perhaps 
close to death. These images can then evolve into visions of 
stabbing or killing, most commonly of people close or familiar 
to the person. A number of patients have described intrusive 
thoughts of killing multiple family members and themselves. 
Representative cases include a young adolescent with seizures 
who had repeated urges to kill their younger sibling. Another 
patient who had frequent temporal lobe seizures had intrusive 
thoughts of killing with an axe or knife any female he had a 
relationship with and described a mechanism in their head that 
would say kill her, kill her. These thoughts were invariably 
ego dystonic. The same patient also had thoughts of killing 
infant and adult female family members. In some cases, the 
aggression can be particularly toward women. Some patients 
described intrusive bizarre sexual and pedophilic thoughts and 
impulses. Others also described sudden and unprovoked urges 
to harm family members, and sometimes these episodes would 
be preceded by feeling a sense of derealization. Patients also 
describe intrusive and unprovoked episodes of anger with an 
urge to destroy. One patient described sudden urges to rip the 
room apart and kill everyone and every animal in the house. 
The intrusive episodes are often described as being episodic 
and not continuous. The images do not seem to necessarily be 
associated with a particular trigger, and one patient described 
them as invading the privacy of their mind.
Patients described fear of their suicidal and homicidal 
rage. It is described as rage that comes out of nowhere and 
takes over their whole body, with no control over it. In some, 
it is worse when they are driving. Some patients are scared 
for the people who come in contact with them and are afraid 
the thoughts will become even worse. Patients have described 
episodes of anger that would occur suddenly and totally 
unprovoked. A patient described looking at someone and 
feeling anger for no reason whatsoever, for example, looking 
at someone in a restaurant and having an urge to hurt the 
person. A patient described road rage out of nowhere and 
fantasies of beating and killing people. Patients have also

described obsessions where they wished they had an excuse 
to go after someone. Another patient had an intrusive urge to 
throw a baby off of a balcony. He was particularly frightened 
when he had these urges in the presence of children and con-
sidered suicide to prevent himself from killing anyone.
One patient described that his pain was so bad, and he 
wanted to take it out on everyone else. Another patient who 
developed an impairment of empathy and was highly sensitive 
to perceived injury expressed, “if someone hurts me, I want 
to hurt them back. I want to make them cry. I want them to 
feel my pain.” Others responded to the intrusive homicidal 
and harmful impulses by becoming suicidal or self-destructive 
in an effort to prevent themselves from harming others. One 
patient accused his family members of being imposters.
Frequently, the thoughts or impulses to harm are preceded 
by being overstimulated, often by sound. For example, a 
normally passive individual who is an animal lover has 
hyperacusis and has intrusive hostile imagery of killing the 
dog by bludgeoning, suffocation, stabbing, or poisoning when 
it howled. Another patient responded to the neighbor’s dog 
barking by opening the window and screaming death threats 
to the dog. After acting in that manner, the patient began 
crying uncontrollably and wanted to die. Another patient 
described intrusive, overpowering very violent thoughts 
which sometimes would be triggered by stimulation; such as 
a dog barking, a bird chirping, a strobe light, or the presence 
of other people. Another patient described that the noise of 
her neighbors playing sports was unbearable. She had an urge 
to go to the neighbors and start screaming wildly. Sound is 
not the only trigger. A patient described sitting at a table with 
guests and her father behind her. When the father called for 
the dog, the patient became startled, punched her father and 
screamed at him with a total lack of control.
Not all aggressiveness is described as being provoked 
by stimulation. Some LD patients are intolerant to alcohol 
and/or react strongly to low doses of psychotropics or have 
idiosyncratic reactions to them. Some episodes are associated 
with the combination of the effects of LD and exposure to 
a number of medications and/or alcohol. A number of legal 
cases have involved bizarre and aggressive behavior while 
under the effects of alcohol and/or medications.
A few patients who had acquired LD as a congenital infec-
tion or were infected at a very young age had significantly 
impaired recognition of emotions of social significance and 
had difficulty processing interpersonal cues. They would some-
times take offense when normal limits were set on them. This 
occasionally resulted in a perceived injury, a rapid escalation of 
agitation, and because of their impaired capacity for empathy, it 
would sometimes result in assaultive behavior. Violent behavior 
seemed more problematic when the illness began in young 
children who have no memory to serve as a reference point for 
healthy functioning. There were a number of cases involving 
children infected at a young age that were quite severe. In these 
cases, psychopathic traits are evident, and the patients may 
repeatedly assault their family members, damage their house, 
knock over furniture, and kick and punch holes through walls 
and doors. Frequent police intervention was needed with these 
patients. In these cases, there is often a lack of empathy and a 
lack of remorse for their behavior. With antibiotic and psycho-
tropic treatment, the impulse control disorder can improve, but 
sometimes lack of empathy and lack of remorse can persist.
The oldest legal case that could be found involving LD 
was in 1993, in which the patient was treated and the legal 
charges were dismissed. A number of cases were managed in 
a similar manner over a span of years. There were a number 
of shoplifting cases, mostly involving females. There were 
a few cases involving fire setting. In one case, the patient 
burned down his house as a result of a paranoid delusion. 
Some individuals with psychotic symptoms acted bizarrely 
and were repeatedly drawing the attention of the legal sys-
tem and occasionally SWAT (special weapons attack team) 
teams. A few patients attacked multiple police officers in a 
bizarre and senseless manner.
retrospective chart review: homicidality
Inactive charts were reviewed until 50 LD subjects with 
homicidal tendencies were identified, that is, 520 charts were 
screened until 50 cases could be identified (9.6%). A few of 
these charts had a few incomplete data points. There were 98% 
(N=49) of the subjects who were also suicidal. In this group of 
50 homicidal patients, there were five homicides. The subjects 
who committed homicides were incarcerated and evaluated in 
forensic settings. Forty nine of the 50 homicidal patients were 
not homicidal before being infected with LD. It is possible one 
patient may have been homicidal before being infected with 
LD. The average age was 35 years (youngest 11 years and old-
est 63 years). The average age of onset of illness was 26 years. 
There were 52% male and 48% female subjects, and 10% were 
diagnosed immediately after infection, but had inadequate 
initial treatment. The average subject experienced a delay of 
9 years before diagnosis and treatment. There were 22% of 
subjects that were diagnosed in #2 years. The longest length 
of time before diagnosis was 40 years. There were 66% that 
met Center for Disease and Prevention Surveillance Criteria 
for Lyme disease. All who committed homicides met the 
Surveillance Criteria. There were 84% of subjects misdiag-
nosed at some point, and the misdiagnoses included “all in 
your head,” “just nuts,” “laziness,” “nervousness,” “hyper,”

Coinfections in this group in order of frequency included 
Babesia, Anaplasma, Bartonella, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, 
Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, mycoplasma, Rickettsia 
rickettsii, and Hepatitis C.
An additional 50 charts of LD patients who were not homi-
cidal were randomly selected, and the prevalence of symptoms 
was compared with the prevalence of the same symptoms in 
LD patients who were homicidal. In this group, the average 
age was 42 years (youngest 8 years and oldest 67 years). 
There were 44% of male and 56% of female subjects. About 
10% were diagnosed immediately after infection, but had 
inadequate initial treatment. The average subject experienced a 
delay of 8.1 years before diagnosis and treatment. There were 
32% who were diagnosed in #2 years. The greatest length of 
time before diagnosis was 39 years. There were 74% meet-
ing Center for Disease and Prevention Surveillance Criteria. 
Misdiagnosis had occurred in 92% of these subjects.
Both the groups of patients in this study were generally 
quite healthy compared with the general population, prein-
fection; however, postinfection, both the groups developed 
significant cognitive symptoms, emotional symptoms, veg-
etative symptoms, behavioral symptoms, neurological symp-
toms, musculoskeletal symptoms, cardiovascular symptoms, 
gastrointestinal symptoms, urogenital symptoms, and other 
symptoms. Coinfections in this group in order of frequency 
included Babesia, Bartonella, E. chaffeensis, Anaplasma, 
mycoplasma, R. rickettsii, Epstein–Barr virus, Chlamydia 
pneumoniae, and Coxiella burnetii.
Comparing the two groups, it was found that there were 
significant differences in the prevalence of psychiatric 
symptoms, behavioral symptoms, psychiatric syndromes, 
cognitive symptoms, neurological symptoms, and urogenital 
symptoms. Not all symptoms that were studied showed a 
statistically significant separation between the two groups 
that might explain homicidality or appeared relevant to 
violence. These symptoms included attention deficits, audi-
tory hyperacusis, other sensory hyperacusis, facial memory 
impairments, executive functioning impairments, decreased 
frustration tolerance, fatigue, sleep disorder, decline in social 
relationships, decline in school or work productivity and 
chronic pain. A number of signs, symptoms and syndromes 
associated with violent risk were increased in the homicidal 
group and these findings were further analyzed. The 95% CI 
was calculated for each data point (Table 1).
Both the homicidal and non-homicidal groups showed an 
increase of all the impairments studied preinfection versus 
postinfection (95% CI) (Table 2).
The homicidal group had a greater incidence of all the 
psychiatric symptoms studied when compared to the non-
homicidal group. The mean of the psychiatric symptoms 
was 71% in the homicidal versus 41% in the non-homicidal 
group (Figure 2).
retrospective chart review: homicide
In reviewing the LD charts involving both LD and homicide, 10 
homicides were identified. None of these homicides were cases 
discussed when reviewing media reports in the “Background” 
section. Three of the 10 homicides involved suspected LD that 
was not confirmed, and these cases were not included in the 
study. The other seven homicides were associated with well-
confirmed cases of LD. All seven victims had a prior personal 
relationship with the perpetrators, either real or imagined by 
the perpetrator. Two of these cases did not have completed 
neuropsychiatric assessments and were included in the retro-
spective chart review of homicides but were not included in 
the retrospective data analysis of homicidal LD patients.
Of the seven homicides, one was a combined homicide, 
dog killing, and suicide, which seemed to have been related 
to impulsivity. Also there were other homicide, dog killing, 
and suicide cases which occurred that were not evaluated by 
the author.189,190 Another homicide was associated with psy-
chosis, and the other five had predatory features. In a preda-
tory case, the Lyme enzyme-linked immunoassay was 6.83 
(positive $ 1.10). Whenever these cases involving homicide 
were tested for coinfections, there was positive reactivity to 
coinfections, which included Bartonella, Babesia, myco-
plasma, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, E. chaffeensis, and 
viral coinfections. All cases involving predatory aggression 
also included a history of reported abuse. Findings also 
included head injuries, social communication impairments, 
an impaired capacity to bond and empathize with others, 
social isolation, a fascination with knives, less than a normal 
amount of anxiety, fire setting, and torturing animals prior 
to the homicides. In all of the LD cases involving homicide,

there were obstacles preventing both adequate antibiotic and 
psychiatric treatments.
Discussion
Upon reviewing the existing literature and the retrospec-
tive chart reviews, LD patients postinfection may acquire a 
number of impairments that are collectively associated with 
an increased risk of violence and homicidality, but some 
acquired impairments are more likely to increase risk than 
others. In spite of having impairments, the majority of LD 
patients are able to compensate and may only demonstrate 
low frustration tolerance and irritability. Some, however, 
demonstrate more severe symptoms. To better understand 
why many LD patients are not aggressive, while others can 
be highly aggressive, it is necessary to look at the different 
symptoms seen in these two groups.

aggressiveness, violence, homicidality, homicide, and lyme disease
For organizational purposes, the data are presented as 
cognitive impairments, emotional impairments, behavioral 
symptoms, psychiatric syndromes (multiple brain regions), 
neurological impairments, and somatic impairments.
Individuals with cognitive impairments have less coping 
skills and in general can have increased risk for violence. 
Among the homicidal subjects in this study, 98% had 
impaired capacity for sustained and/or selective attention; 
88% had auditory hyperacusis (misophonia); 86% had 
sensory hyperacusis to light, touch, and/or smell; 98% had 
memory impairments (most commonly working memory and 
short-term memory); 94% had processing impairments; 78% 
had dyslexia symptoms; and 98% had executive functioning 
memory impairments. Sensory hyperacusis is associated with 
an impaired capacity to filter incoming stimulation, resulting 
in a sensory overload, and contributes to making a patient 
more reclusive and socially isolated and also contributes 
to them being more emotionally reactive to stimulation 
that average people can easily tolerate. Some patients have 
selective hyperacusis to mouth sounds, which I propose may 
possibly be the result of a disinhibition of a primitive fear of 
oral predation from brain dysfunction. Facial memory impair-
ments were similar in both the homicidal and non-homicidal 
groups and seems to be non-contributory. However, patients 
with more violent potential had an impairment of emotional 
recognition when they saw a familiar person, and this impair-
ment would sometimes result in their accusations that family 
and friends were imposters (Capgras’ syndrome).191
Individuals with certain emotional impairments can 
have greater risk for aggressiveness. Among the homicidal 
subjects in this study, 71% had depersonalization, 37% had 
derealization, 62% had intrusive aggressive images, 26% 
had intrusive sexual images, 82% had vivid nightmares, 47% 
had hallucinations, 98% had decreased frustration tolerance, 
94% had sudden abrupt mood swings, 84% had hypervigi-
lance, 88% had paranoia, 84% had disinhibition, 84% had 
exaggerated startle reactions, 91% had explosive anger, 38% 
had dissociative episodes, and 86% had anhedonia.
Individuals with certain behavioral symptoms can have 
greater risk for aggressiveness. Among the homicidal subjects 
in this study, 98% were suicidal, 91% had a decline in social 
functioning, 90% had a decline in school or work produc-
tivity, 80% had marital and/or family problems, 33% had 
substance abuse, and 42% had legal problems.
Individuals with certain psychiatric syndromes can have 
greater risk for aggressiveness. Among the homicidal subjects 
in this study, 98% had depression, 28% had rapid cycling 
bipolar illness, 82% had panic disorder, 51% had obsessive 
compulsive disorder, 66% had social anxiety disorder, 86% 
had generalized anxiety disorder, and 36% had PTSD.
Individuals with certain urological symptoms, particu-
larly urinary incontinence (along with torturing animals and 
fire setting), are considered by some to be at greater risk 
for predatory aggression. Among the homicidal subjects in 
this study, 38% had urinary incontinence, 56% had irritable 
bladder, and 32% had genital pain.

Among the homicidal subjects in this study, 44% had 
intolerance to alcohol with a more exaggerated response to 
alcohol consumption. Alcohol intoxication is a well recog-
nized risk for violence and homicide.192
Among the homicidal subjects in this study, other symp-
toms that were present but may or may not correlate with 
homicidal risk included 96% with sleep disorders, 38% with 
decreased libido, 92% with cranial nerve symptoms, 92% 
with neuropathy, 20% with seizures (mostly complex partial), 
48% with chronic pain, and 92% with fatigue.
Violent behavior was more problematic when the illness 
began in young children who had no memory to serve as a 
reference point for healthy functioning.
Although data are limited in two of the homicide cases, it 
seems in the cases involving homicides that there were other 
contributors to violence; however, it also seems that these 
homicides would not have occurred if the perpetrators had 
not had neurological deterioration as a result of LD.
Multiple patients described intrusive thoughts, images, 
and impulses to kill everything, including themselves. 
These descriptions have similarities to the episodes in which 
the individuals attempt to kill everyone and everything, 
including house pets and themselves. The pathophysiology 
behind this process may be the result of the previously 
described death formula (persistent infection→persistent 
proinflammatory cytokines→dysregulation of tryptophan 
metabolism→quinolinic acid→N-methyl-d-aspartate recep-
tor agonism→glutamate dysregulation→neural circuit 
dysfunction→psychiatric dysfunction→suicidal and/or 
homicidal tendencies) which may be a pathophysiological 
explanation of the death drive (Thantos) concept that was first 
proposed by Spielrein and further advanced by Freud.12,193 It 
is unclear why a few LD patients develop the collective risk 
contributors for violence, but most do not. Possible explana-
tions include the following – there is a genetic vulnerability 
that is triggered in only some who become infected, some 
other pathogen or pathogens other than Borrelia (either 
tick-borne or opportunistic within the host microbiome) may 
be responsible for causing the aggressiveness or it may be 
more the immune reaction to the infection rather than the 
infection itself that is causative, and this immune reaction 
may have multiple other causes. In this study, there was no 
clear difference in the coinfections in the homicidal versus 
the non-homicidal group.
In synthesizing these findings, the following model for 
violence and LD can be constructed (Figures 3 and 4).
There are multiple mechanisms through which infection 
may contribute to violence, and many seem to be immune 
mediated. Impairments associated with infectious disease 
that can contribute to violent behavior include decreased

Conclusion
Violent behavior is the result of a complex interaction of 
many contributors, failures of deterrents, and acute triggering 
events. From evolutionary, geographical, epidemiological, 
and historical perspectives, multiple studies, case reports, and 
animal studies, some infections can be associated with vio-
lence. These infections have psychoimmune and pathophysi-
ological implications through multiple mechanisms that 
include proinflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms 
that can cause multiple impairments impacting brain neu-
rochemistry and neural circuit functioning which can cause 
different types of violence. LD can be one of the many infec-
tious contributors associated with aggressiveness, violence, 
homicidality, and homicide. There is support for this from 
journal citations, presentations, animal studies, psychoim-
munology, neurochemistry, neural circuity, reports, and 
observations. Delays in diagnosing and treating LD may 
result in an increased risk of aggressiveness that can result 
in impulsive, psychotic, and/or predatory aggression. Most 
violence seen with LD seems to be impulsive, bizarre, and 
senseless.
The most common case is a young male with impairments 
during development who lacks a reference point of mature 
healthy functioning before the onset of impairment who may

be at greater risk for violence if he was infected at a younger 
age and has impaired recognition of emotions of social sig-
nificance and difficulty processing interpersonal cues.
LD causes a number of impairments that collectively 
increase the risk of homicidality. Postinfection findings 
associated with homicidality that separated from the non-
homicidal group within the 95% CI included suicidality, 
sudden abrupt mood swings, explosive anger, paranoia, 
anhedonia, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle, disinhibi-
tion, nightmares, depersonalization, intrusive aggressive 
images, dissociative episodes, derealization, intrusive sexual 
images, marital/family problems, legal problems, substance 
abuse, depression, panic disorder, memory impairments, 
neuropathy, cranial nerve symptoms, and decreased libido. 
Although predatory aggression with LD seems to be an 
uncommon presentation, it accounts for the greatest number 
of homicides. A patient who acquires LD and is inadequately 
diagnosed and treated may be at risk for committing homi-
cide if they have a history of reported abuse, head injuries, 
social communication impairments, an impaired capacity to 
bond and empathize with others, social isolation, a fascina-
tion with knives, less than a normal amount of anxiety, fire 
setting, torturing animals, and obstacles preventing adequate 
antibiotic and psychiatric treatment.
Some patients have selective hyperacusis to mouth 
sounds, which I propose may possibly be the result of brain 
dysfunction causing a disinhibition of a primitive fear of 
oral predation.
As with the vast majority of patients with mental illness, 
many patients with LD have no aggressive tendencies or only 
mild degrees of low frustration tolerance and irritability and 
pose no danger to society. A lesser number experience marital 
and family conflicts, a lesser number experience explosive 
anger, a lesser number experience homicidal thoughts and 
impulses, and a much lesser number commit homicides. 
Since such a large number of individuals are affected by 
LD, this small percent of LD cases can be significant and is 
a cause for concern.
Many of the patients who became aggressive and 
homicidal responded to effective treatment, and much of the 
violence associated with LD can be avoided with better pre-
vention, diagnosis, and treatment of LD. Although this article 
focused upon violence associated with LD, violence associ-
ated with other infectious diseases are also significant, and 
greater research into the association between infections and 
violence is strongly recommended. Human history is also a 
history of violence. Understanding violence and recogniz-
ing the role of microbes and psychoimmunology opens new 
opportunities to prevent violent behavior, suffering, crime, 
war, and social discord and protect peace. We need a multi-
disciplinary mobilization of our scientific community to 
better understand all the facets of violence to prevent future 
tragedies similar to the approach used to understand and 
prevent airplane crashes.
