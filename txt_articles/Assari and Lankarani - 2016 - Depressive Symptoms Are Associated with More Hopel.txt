Background: Hopelessness is a core component of depression. Our information is, 
however, very limited on ethnic variations in the magnitude of the link between depres-
sion and hopelessness. Using a national sample of older adults in United States, we 
compared Blacks and Whites for the magnitude of the association between depressive 
symptoms and hopelessness.
Methods: With a cross-sectional design, we used baseline data of the Religion, 
Aging, and Health Survey, 2001. Linear regression models were used for data analysis. 
Depressive symptoms (CES-D) and hopelessness were conceptualized as independent 
and dependent variables in different models, respectively. Demographic factors (age 
and gender), socioeconomic status (education and marital status), and health (self-rated 
health) were covariates. Ethnicity was the moderator.
results: In the pooled sample, higher depressive symptoms were predictive of hope-
lessness, above and beyond all covariates. We also found significant interactions sug-
gesting that the association between depressive symptoms and hopelessness is weaker 
among Blacks compared to Whites. In ethnic-specific models, there were significant 
associations between depressive symptoms and hopelessness among Whites but not 
Blacks.
conclusion: Depressive symptoms accompany more hopelessness among Whites 
than Blacks. This finding may explain why Blacks with depression have a lower tendency 
to commit suicide. Future research should test whether or not Whites with depression 
better respond to psychotherapies and cognitive behavioral therapies that focus on 
hope enhancement. This finding may explain differential correlates of depression based 
on race and ethnicity.

Hopelessness is associated with a wide range of negative mood states, both in the general popula-
tion and clinical settings (1). Hopelessness increases the risk of emotional maladjustment (2). The 
literature has consistently shown that hopelessness is a risk factor for depression (3). Individuals with 
depression experience higher levels of hopelessness than those without depression (4–6). Whether 
or not ethnic groups differ in the link between depression and hopelessness is, however, unknown.

Race, Depression, and Hopelessness

Negative perspectives concerning the future, which is hopeless-
ness, is a part of Beck’s negative cognitive triad (7). Hopelessness 
is a main aspect of a depressive cognitive style (7). As described by 
Beck, hopelessness plays a key role in the trajectory of depression 
and suicide, and it has been confirmed as a risk factor for negative 
outcomes associated with depression (8, 9). Both retrospective 
and large-scale prospective follow-up studies have documented 
hopelessness as a strong predictor of suicidal behavior (10, 11). 
Hopelessness also predicts general mood outcomes and function-
ing in the presence of affective disorders (12).
Ethnicity influences how hopelessness (13) and depression (14) 
are distributed across populations. Studies have shown that hope 
and optimism are differently experienced across ethnic groups, 
who are different in cultural experiences, life circumstances, 
values, and beliefs (15–17). Hirsch et al. studied depressive symp-
toms, hopelessness [defined as future attitudes and motivation 
loss (pathways)], trait hope [defined as confidence in the ability to 
identify and attain goals (agency)], and suicidal behaviors among 
Whites and Blacks. Trait hope buffered the association between 
low depressive symptoms and suicidal behavior for Whites but 
not Blacks. In addition, while hope remained a significant mod-
erator for Whites, hopelessness operated as the main buffer for 
Blacks. The study suggested that outcomes associated with hope 
and hopelessness differ based on ethnicity (13).
Differential effect hypothesis views ethnicity not only as a proxy 
of exposure to risk and protective factors but also as a contextual 
factor that shapes human’s resilience and vulnerability. Based on 
this view, ethnicity operates as a contextual factor and alters how 
the very same risk and protective factors influence the very same 
health outcomes across diverse populations (18–25). This view 
is very different from the traditionally used differential exposure 
hypothesis, which attributes disparities in outcomes to group 
differences in exposures rather than vulnerabilities. Distinct 
from the differential exposure hypothesis, which assumes univer-
sality of the effects of risk and resilience factors, the differential 
effect hypothesis is focused on heterogeneity in the magnitude 
and direction of the effects that ultimately shape health and 
illness of diverse populations. Thus, instead of merely focusing 
on the main effect of ethnicity on exposures and outcomes 
or testing mediating effects of exposure, the differential effect 
hypothesis searches for qualitative and quantitative differences 
in the magnitude and direction of the associations between 
predictors and outcomes (26). According to the differential 
effect hypothesis, associations in health are seldom universal but 
specific to  
context (22–26).
Using a national sample of older adults in the United States 
and built on previous studies in the field (13)1,2 the current study 
tests the moderating effect of ethnicity on the association between 
depressive symptoms and hopelessness. Based on previous theo-
retical work (27–29) and empirical evidence (1–6) on hopeless-
ness and depression, we expected a weaker association between 
depressive symptoms and hopelessness for Blacks compared to

Whites, given their higher levels of religiosity (30–32), connect-
edness (33), and social support (34). This study contributes to the 
literature as – up to our knowledge – very limited information 
exists on group differences in the association between depression 
and hopelessness.

Design and setting
This cross-sectional study used baseline data of the religion, 
aging, and health survey, a household survey, 2001. The study 
protocol received Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval 
from University of Michigan. All participants provided  
consent 
(35).
sampling and Participants
The study is limited to White or Black American older adults. All 
participants were non-institutionalized English speaking people 
of age more than 65 years. The study population was limited to 
Christians or those who were never associated with any faith. 
Older Blacks were oversampled in the survey (35).
Measures
Ethnicity, age, gender, education, marital status, self-rated health 
(SRH), depressive symptoms, and hopelessness were measured 
via face-to-face interviews in 2001.
Depressive Symptoms
An eight-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression 
scale (CES-D) (36) was used to measure depressive symptoms. 
Items used were as the following: (1) felt I could not shake off
 
the blues even with the help of my family and friends, (2) I felt 
depressed, (3) I had crying spells, (4) I felt sad, (5) I did not feel 
like eating, my appetite was poor, (6) I felt that everything I did 
was an effort, (7) My sleep was restless, and (8) I could not get 
going. All these items either measure negative affect or somatic 
symptoms. Positive affect and interpersonal items were not 
reflected in this version of the CES-D. Abbreviated CES-D meas-
ures using 8 items (37, 38) have shown acceptable reliability and 
validity as compared to the original 20-item version (27, 39, 40). 
Responses ranged from 1 (“rarely or none”) to 4 (“most or all 
of the time”). We calculated mean score which was treated as a 
continuous measure, with a potential range from 1 to 4. Higher 
scores indicated more depressive symptoms (Alpha = 0.870 for 
all, 0.849 for Whites, 0.889 for Blacks).
Hopelessness
Hopelessness 
was 
measured 
with 
the 
following 
four 
items: (1) I always look on the bright side of things, (2) I am opti-
mistic about my future, (3) In uncertain times, I always expect 
the best, and (4) I feel confident that the rest of my life will turn 
out well. These items are based on the scales developed by Scheier 
and Carver (3) and Krause (41). Item responses included strongly 
agree (1), agree (2), disagree (3), and strongly disagree (4). We 
did not use any specific cut-off score. Instead, we operational-
ized hopelessness as a continuous measure. We calculated our 
hopelessness score as the mean of the four items, where a higher

score reflected more hopelessness (less hope) (42) (Alpha = 0.896 
for all, 0.892 for Whites, 0.901 for Blacks).
Self-Rated Health
Individuals were evaluated for their SRH in 2001 using the fol-
lowing single item: how would you rate your overall health at the 
present time? Would you say your health is excellent, good, fair, 
or poor? Response options included excellent (1), good (2), fair 
(3), or poor (4). SRH has shown high reliability and validity. We 
operationalized SRH as a dichotomous variable comparing poor 
vs. other statuses. Dichotomization of a continuous (ordinal) 
variable will result in loss of information; however, SRH has been 
widely treated as a dichotomous variable in the literature (43–45). 
Operationalizing SRH as a dichotomous variable increases the 
degrees of freedom in our models.
statistical analysis
We used SPSS 20.0 for Windows (IBM Inc., Armonk, NY, USA) 
for data analysis. For bivariate analysis, we used Pearson cor-
relation test. For multivariable analysis, linear regression was 
applied. To test the reciprocal associations between depressive 
symptoms, once we considered depressive symptoms as an 
independent variable and hopelessness as the outcome, then 
we ran linear regressions with hopelessness as the independent 
variable and level of depressive symptoms as the outcome. In the 
first step, we fitted linear regressions in the pooled sample (Model 
1). Then, we added the interaction term (Model 2), which was 
the multiplication of ethnicity (0 for Whites 1 for Blacks) and 
depressive symptoms or hopelessness (treated as a continuous 
measure). In the next step, we ran ethnic-specific models (Model 
4 and Model 5). In all our models, demographics, socioeconom-
ics, and SRH were covariates, and ethnicity was the moderator. 
Adjusted correlation coefficients (β), SE, and 95% Confidence 
Intervals (CI) were reported. p-Values <0.05 were considered 
statistically significant.
resUlTs
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics, overall and also based on 
race. While age was not significantly different between Blacks 
and Whites (74.91 ± 6.49 vs. 75.37 ± 6.82, p > 0.05), Blacks 
were more likely to be female (65.1 vs. 58.6%, p < 0.05), had 
lower education (44.0 vs. 73.4%, p < 0.05), were less frequently 
married (35.7 vs. 59.5%, p < 0.05), and reported worse self-
rated health (15.1 vs. 8.2%, p < 0.05) (for all comparisons). 
Blacks had marginally significant higher depressive symptoms 
(1.59 ± 0.65 vs. 1.54 ± 0.59, p = 0.06). Hopelessness was not dif-
ferent between Blacks and Whites (1.82 ± 0.60 vs. 1.91 ± 0.58, 
p > 0.05).
Table 2 shows the results of correlations between study 
variables in the pooled sample as well as ethnic groups. 
Based on this table, depressive symptoms and hopelessness 
were positively correlated in the pooled sample (r = 0.151, 
p < 0.001). Depressive symptoms and hopelessness were cor-
related among Whites (r = 0.227, p < 0.001) but not Blacks 
(r = 0.080, p > 0.05).
effect of Depressive symptoms on 
hopelessness
Table 3 shows the results of four linear regressions with depressive 
symptoms as the independent and hopelessness as the dependent 
variable. Model 1 and Model 2 are run in the pooled sample, Model 
3 was run among Whites, and Model 4 among Blacks. Model 1, 
which did not include any interaction, showed a positive associa-
tion between depressive symptoms and hopelessness (β = 0.12, 95% 
CI = 0.33–1.17), net of all covariates. Model 2 showed a significant 
interaction between ethnicity and depressive symptoms on hope-
lessness (β = −0.25, 95% CI = −1.83 to 0.22, for the interaction 
term), suggesting a larger effect for Whites compared to Blacks. 
This interaction was significant net of all covariates. According 
to Model 3, depressive symptoms were positively associated with 
hopelessness among Whites (β = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.72–1.93). 
Depressive symptoms were not associated with hopelessness 
among Blacks (β = 0.04, 95% CI = −0.39 to 0.81) (Model 4).
effect of hopelessness on Depressive 
symptoms
Table 4 shows the results of four linear regression models 
with hopelessness and depressive symptoms as the inde-
pendent and dependent variables, respectively. The first 
two linear regressions are in the pooled sample, the third 
model is among Whites, and the fourth model is among 
Blacks. Model 1, which did not include the interaction term, 
showed hopelessness is positively associated with depressive

DiscUssiOn
Our study documented stronger reciprocal associations between 
depressive symptoms and hopelessness among Whites compared 
to Blacks. Our findings are in line with the differential effect 
hypothesis, which suggests ethnic groups differ for the associa-
tions that ultimately influence health and illness (26, 46–49). That 
is, ethnicity shapes the degree by which depressive symptoms 
accompany hopelessness in the general population of older adults.
We found a positive association between depressive symptoms 
and hopelessness in the pooled sample and Whites. Hopelessness 
positively correlates with depression (50–52) and suicidality (53) 
and negatively correlates with happiness (2) and appropriate 
adjustment in the presence of stress (54, 55). Hopelessness is a core 
feature in depressed individuals (1–6). Compared with individuals 
who are hopeless, those who maintain hope are more resilient when 
faced with stress (39). Hope serves as a motivational factor and 
helps with initiation and sustaining actions toward goals (56). In 
the context of clinical depression, hopelessness is a main determi-
nant of suicidality (57), compliance, and treatment outcomes (58).
Our findings on the moderating effect of ethnicity on the 
depression–hopelessness link suggest that Beck’s cognitive triad 
of depression may operate differently for sub-populations. Based 
on Beck’s Cognitive Theory of Depression, negative cognitions 
about the future (hopelessness), as well as dysfunctional beliefs 
about self and the world, are core components of depression 
(2). Our study suggests that hoplessness accompanies depres-
sion differently across ethnic groups. Black–White differences 
were observed in the effects of depression on dysfunctional 
attitudes about self1,2. In two nationally representative studies 
using independent samples, Assari has documented a stronger 
effects of depression on self-esteem and self-evaluation among 
Blacks compared to Whites1. These studies have suggested that 
depression may leave a larger scar on self-perception for Blacks 
compared to Whites1.
Our findings on ethnic-specific attitudes about future (hope-
lessness) may inform how cognitive behavioral therapy and 
psychotherapy can benefit from tailoring based on ethnicity. 
Dysfunctional attitudes about future, self, and others are being 
considered as targets of psychotherapy of the illness (59). Ethnic 
groups, who differ in how depression changes attitudes about self, 
others, and future (60), may benefit differently from cognitive 
behavioral therapies with the same level of emphasis on attitudes 
about self, others, and future. Our results suggest that Blacks may 
need less emphasis on hope as a component of psychotherapy for 
depression, compared to Whites (61). Thus, current results are 
relevant to the program planning and clinical practice that aim to 
reduce ethnic inequalities in depression outcomes in the United 
States. Findings also inform how we should measure depression 
(as a latent factor) is composed of dysfunctional attitudes about 
future, self, and others, across ethnically diverse groups (62). This 
is particularly important because such dysfunctional attitudes are 
prognostic factors for the treatment of depression (63).
Although early theories of hope had conceptualized the con-
struct as a unidimensional motivational force (28), more recent 
models have expanded how we define hope. In 1969, Stotland 
described hope as “an expectation greater than zero of achieving a 
goal” (29). In 1987, Scheier and Carver defined hope and optimism 
as the “tendency to believe that one will generally experience posi-
tive vs. negative outcomes in life” (27, 64). Snyder viewed hope as 
an “internal sense of success and an active motivation state” (3, 
65, 66). In Snyder’s view, hope is composed of two interrelated 
cognitive dimensions: agency and pathways (3, 65–67). Agency 
and pathway components of hope have different implications 
regarding depression (28). In one study, the agency but not the 
pathway component of hope predicted later depression (28).
Our findings also suggest that the salience of hopelessness as 
a mechanism behind development and course of depression may 
vary across ethnic groups. According to the theory of hopelessness 
depression, “hopelessness temporally precedes depression and is 
 6

a proximal sufficient cause of the symptoms of depression.” Based 
on this theory, hopelessness explains the effects of stress and lack 
of social support on depression (68). Our findings suggest that 
the degree by which hopelessness contributes to depression is 
larger for Whites than Blacks (69). Whether or not the theory of 
hopelessness depression is differently valid for Blacks and Whites 
is still unknown.
Our findings on Black–White differences in the link between 
depressive symptoms and hopelessness are in line with other 
Black–White differences in other domains of health, which 
are linked with depression. Blacks and Whites differ in the 
links between stress, medical conditions, and depression 
(14, 49, 70– 72). Blacks and Whites also differ in the effect of 
baseline depressive symptoms on subsequent medical conditions 
and death (3, 14, 24, 73, 74). These differential associations can be 
explained by our current finding that ethnicity mitigates the link 
between depressive symptoms and hope. The results also support 
Black–White paradox (74, 75), defined as a lower risk of depres-
sion among Blacks despite a higher risk of adversities including 
medical conditions (14, 71, 76).
Our findings are not supported by the literature that sug-
gests clinical depression is more consequential for Blacks 
compared to Whites (14, 77, 78). Depression is believed to be 
more chronic and disabling for Blacks compared to Whites 
(14, 77, 78). Higher prevalence of comorbid medical condi-
tions (79, 80), somatic presentation of depression (81), lower 
access and trust to the health-care system combined with 
higher stigma (14, 77, 78), as well as negative beliefs regard-
ing pharmaceutical treatments (14, 82) make depression 
more consequential for Blacks compared to Whites (14, 83, 
84). Blacks have a lower chance of diagnosis and treatment of 
depression, and if they do receive a diagnosis, they will receive 
lower quality of services as they tend to get depression treat-
ment in primary care settings rather than mental health-care 
settings (78, 85).
Our findings do not support the multiple disadvantage theory 
(86–88), which suggests the same risk factors are more harmful 
for Blacks than Whites, as they are exposed to multiple expo-
sures (89). Our findings that depressive symptoms accompanied 
more hope for Blacks compared to Whites can be better under-
stood in a resiliency framework (90). Despite a higher rate of pov-
erty (91), lower social position (78), more severe depression (92), 
more comorbid conditions (78), less access to health care (72), 
and differences in the diagnosis and treatment of depression (93), 
Blacks with depression may have a higher tendency to maintain 
hope, possibly due to endorsing higher levels of religiosity and 
receiving higher levels of social support.
Our findings have major implications for clinical practice. 
Sense of hope is essential for maintaining self-efficacy (5), self-
care, health services use, and positive psychological outcomes 
(94). Compared to Whites, Blacks with depression see the future 
as more positive, a finding that may help clinicians who treat 
depression among diverse population groups. Hopelessness 
increases negative feelings and uncertain views about future 
events and possibilities (67) and reduces the expectation that 
positive outcomes may be forthcoming in the future (3, 66, 
95–97). These negative views may be more prevalent in depres-
sion among Whites than Blacks.
An implication of our finding is for suicide research and 
practice. Hopelessness strongly predicts suicide and may mediate 
the effect of depression on suicidality (98). Thus, our findings on 
higher hopefulness in the presence of depression may partially 
explain the lower suicide rate of Blacks compared to Whites 
(46, 99, 100). According to our findings, suicide prevention pro-
grams among Whites who suffer depression may require more 
emphasis on hope enhancement (101).
Our study had a few limitations. The first limitation is the 
exploratory nature of our statistical analyses conducted. Second, 
validity of measures used to assess depressive symptoms and 
hopelessness may vary across ethnic groups (102). We did not 
use specific psychometric tools to assess hopelessness but simply 
adopted a four-item scale. We cannot rule out differential under-
reporting of depressive symptoms and hopelessness across ethnic 
groups (81, 103). We also did not measure stereotype threat. Blacks 
may express less hopelessness due to concerns regarding being 
negatively evaluated. Third, participants were either Christians or 
those who were never associated with any faith. Future research 
should test if ethnicity or faith explains Black–White differences 
in the link between depression and hopelessness. Finally, as we 
did not have longitudinal data and did not use path modeling for 
data analysis, we do not conclude any causation from observed 
associations. Thus, we do not argue that depression differently 
causes hopelessness across groups. Both empirical evidence and 
theoretical work have suggested that the links between  
depression 
and hopelessness are bidirectional. Based on the scar model, 
depression diminishes hope and according to the vulnerability 
model, hopelessness increases vulnerability for depression (4–6). 
Despite these limitations, our study is one of the first studies on 
ethnic heterogeneity of the association between depression and 
hopelessness. Using a national sample and considerable sample 
size of Blacks were the strengths of the current study.
Results of this study help us understand ethnic differences 
in correlates of depression. Hope is one of the most neglected 
virtues in the literature (104). Human virtues such as hope and 
optimism are strong buffers against psychological adversities on 
a wide range of mental disorders (105, 106). 
More research is needed on possible roles that attitudes about 
self, others, and future play on depression across various ethnic 
groups (103). Future research may also explore how the current 
findings can be used to reduce the burden of depression and 
hopelessness across populations. Differential hopelessness may 
contribute to ethnic variation in causes, courses, and consequences 
of depression across ethnic groups, which have implications for 
the elimination of health disparities (107–111).
cOnclUsiOn
In summary, Black–White differences exist in the magnitude of 
the association between depressive symptoms and hopelessness, 
with Blacks showing a weaker association compared to Whites. 
This finding suggests that depression may be more hopeless for 
Whites compared to Blacks.
