 Firearm Ownership and Suicide Rates Among
US Men and Women, 1981–2013
Michael Siegel, MD, MPH, and Emily F. Rothman, ScD, MS
Objectives. To examine the relationship between state-level firearm ownership rates
and gender-specific, age-adjusted firearm and total suicide rates across all 50 US states
from 1981 to 2013.
Methods. We used panel data for all 50 states that included annual overall and
gender-specific suicide and firearm suicide rates and a proxy for state-level household
firearm ownership. We analyzed data by using linear regression and generalized esti-
mating equations to account for clustering.
Results. State-level firearm ownership was associated with an increase in both male
and female firearm-related suicide rates and with a decrease in nonfirearm-related
suicide rates. Higher gun ownership was associated with higher suicide rates by any
means among male, but not among female, persons.
Conclusions. We found a strong relationship between state-level firearm ownership
and firearm suicide rates among both genders, and a relationship between firearm
ownership and suicides by any means among male, but not female, individuals.
Policy implications. For male persons, policies that reduce firearm ownership will likely
reduce suicides by all means and by firearms. For female persons, such policies will likely
reduce suicides by firearms. (Am J Public Health. 2016;106:1316–1322. doi:10.2105/

pproximately 40 000 people die as
a result of suicide each year in the United
States, making it the 10th leading cause of
death in the nation and costing approximately
$44 billion per year.1,2 Although firearm
homicide may be the most frequently re-
ported aspect of firearm mortality by the press,
the number of annual firearm suicides is al-
most twice as high as the number of firearm
homicides. In 2013, there were 11 208 fire-
arm homicides and 21 175 firearm suicides.1
Two recent studies demonstrated a strong
association between levels of firearm own-
ership and rates of firearm homicide at the
state level.3,4 We examined the relationship
between state-level firearm ownership and
state-specific suicide rates.
Two major lines of research have ex-
plored the relationship between firearm
prevalence and suicide rates.5–7 A number of
individual-level studies have demonstrated
that the presence of a firearm in the home
increases the risk of suicide, both for the
firearm owner and for household members.5
However, these studies are limited because
they only examine the individual risks of
firearm ownership. They cannot be used to
assess whether the prevalence of firearm
ownership in the population affects suicide
rates for an expanded geographical area.
Moreover, the previous line of research
has been criticized because of the possibility
that people who live in households with
firearms are inherently more likely to at-
tempt suicide and that persons in a home
in which a suicide has occurred may be more
likely to recall firearm ownership.8,9
A second, complementary line of research
addresses these limitations through cross-
sectional studies that correlate levels of firearm
ownership with rates of firearm suicide at the
state or regional level. These studies have
consistently found a relationship between in-
creased levels of firearm ownership in a state or
region and higher rates of firearm suicide.9–25
However, the results regarding the associa-
tion between firearm ownership in a state
or region and total suicide rates have been
mixed, with several studies failing to find
a relationship.15–17,26–29 This conflicting evi-
dence led the National Research Council in
2004 to conclude that
this association is more modest than the association
between [individual] firearm ownership and
firearmsuicide;itislessconsistentlyobservedacross
time, place, and persons; and the causal relation
remains unclear.8(p192)
Since the National Research Council
report in 2004, 4 additional ecological studies
have reported a significant association be-
tween higher levels of firearm ownership
and overall suicide rates at the regional10 or
state7,9,11 level. Still, 2 of these studies ana-
lyzed data for only a single year,7,9 limiting the
generalizability of the findings.
As recently as October 5, 2014, a
Washington Post “fact checker” article re-
ported that “studies have shown little con-
nection between suicides and access to
firearms.”30 In fact, most data used in the
existing studies comprised only a cross-section
in time; only 710,11,17,19,22,23,25 contained
panel data over multiple years. Only 2 of the
studies7,11 analyzed data subsequent to 2002,
and none examined data more recent than
2009. Studies analyzing data over long time
periods are valuable because they assess the

 effects of variation in firearm availability
not only between states but also within states
over time. Recently, we advanced the field of
firearms research by compiling a compre-
hensive database of state-level firearm own-
ership, firearm and total homicide rates, and
20 different sociodemographic control vari-
ables for the 30-year period from 1981 to
2010.3,4,31
Another important criticism of much of the
existing literature on firearm ownership and
suicide is that it has relied upon a proxy
measure of state-level firearm ownership that
correlates with survey measures of household
firearmprevalence onlyat a level of0.80.32 We
recently developed an improved proxy mea-
sure for firearm ownership at the state level,
which increases the correlation with survey-
measured household firearm prevalence from
0.80 to 0.95.32 This new proxy takes into
account not only the proportion of suicides in
which a firearm was used (a long-standing,
validated measure of state-level firearm own-
ership), but also the state’s hunting license rate.
A final limitation of the existing literature is
that only 1 research group (5 studies) has ex-
amined the relationship between firearm
ownership and firearm suicide rates separately
by gender.7,9,10,24,25 The results are conflicting,
with 1 study showing a stronger relationship
for women,9 2 showing a stronger relationship
for men,7,24 and 2 showing no difference.10,25
In this article, we expanded our existing
database through 2013 and added data on
gender-specific firearm and overall suicide
rates by state for the entire period from 1981
to 2013. This study expands upon previous
work by incorporating the most recent data,
analyzing data over 3 decades, using a new
and improved proxy for state-level firearm
ownership, examining the relationship be-
tween firearm ownership levels and firearm
suicide rates separately by gender, and con-
trolling for the most extensive panel to date
of annual, state-specific factors that could
potentially confound the association between
firearm ownership and suicide rates. We
examined the relationship between firearm
ownership and gender-specific, age-adjusted
firearm and total suicide rates across all 50
states during the 33-year period 1981 through
2013, while controlling for region, urbani-
zation, population density, proportion of
Catholic adherents, per capita gross domestic
product, per capita personal disposal income,
household income, education, divorce rate,
alcohol use, violent crime rate, nonviolent
crimerate,andincarcerationrate.Tothebestof
our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive
study to date, both in terms of the number
of years in the analysis and the comprehen-
siveness of the control variables used.
METHODS
For the 33-year period from 1981 to 2013,
we assembled a panel ofdata for all50 states that
included annual overall and gender-specific
suicide and firearm suicide rates and a proxy for
state-level household firearm ownership. We
investigated the relationship between the
firearm ownership level in a state for a given
yearandtheadjustedoverallandfirearmsuicide
rate in that state and year, with control for
factors that couldconfound the association. We
used a linear regression model, accounting for
clustering of observations among years by
entering fixed effects for each year. We
accounted for clustering of observations among
states by using a generalized estimating equa-
tions (GEE) approach. Our basic approach,
including a detailed description of variables,
data sources, and analytic methods, has been
published previously.3
Variables and Data Sources
The outcome variable was the age-
adjusted, gender-specific overall, firearm, or
nonfirearm suicide rate, obtained from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s
(CDC’s) Web-Based Injury Statistics Query
and Reporting Systems database.1 As there
were 33 years and 50 states, the total number
of observations was 1650. However, we
were limited by the small number of female
firearm suicides in some states during some
years. For the years 1999 to 2013, the CDC
does not report data when the number of
counts in a cell (e.g., female firearm suicides)
is fewer than 10. Thus, we were missing data
for 148 year–state observations, resulting in
a final sample size of 1502 for the analyses
of female suicide rates.
The main predictor variable was the
prevalence of household firearm ownership
in a given state for a given year, measured by
our new proxy variable.32 The use of a proxy is
necessary because there are no state-level data
on firearm ownership for most of the study
period. The Behavioral Risk Factor Sur-
veillance System (BRFSS) has not collected
state firearm ownership data since 2004.3
Previous studies have used a decent proxy:
the percentage of suicides in which a firearm
was used (firearm suicides divided by all
suicides, or FS/S). However, the measure
used in those previous studies correlates with
survey measures of firearm ownership only
at a level of 0.80.32 Our new proxy variable,
which includes a state’s hunting license rate
inadditiontoFS/S,improvesthiscorrelationto
0.95.32 The details of how our new proxy
variable was validated are available here.32
The major problem with the traditional
proxy is that it tends to overestimate house-
hold gun ownership in states with low
hunting license rates and to underestimate
household gun ownership in states with high
hunting license rates. The correlation be-
tween hunting license rates and survey
measures of state household gun ownership
is 0.80. By accounting for hunting licenses,
the new proxy produces more accurate es-
timates. For example, in Hawaii, the state
with the lowest hunting license rate, the
BRFSS gun prevalence estimate for 2001 is
9%, the oldproxy is23%, andthe new proxy is
10%. In South Dakota, the state with the
highest hunting license rate, the BRFSS gun
prevalence estimate for 2001 is 57%, the old
proxy is 41%, and the new proxy is 53%.
We controlled for the following state-level
factors, which could potentially be related
both to firearm ownership and suicide rates:
level of urbanization, educational attainment,
unemployment, median household income,
per capita alcohol consumption, non-
homicide violent crime rate (aggravated as-
sault, robbery, and forcible rape), nonviolent
(property) crime rate (burglary, larceny theft,
and motor vehicle theft), incarceration
rate, and divorce rate. To control for differ-
ences in suicide rates by region, we included
indicator variables for the 4 US Census re-
gions (Northeast, Midwest,South, and West).
To further control for urban–rural differ-
ences, we included population density for
each state, obtained from the US Census.33
To control for differences between states and
over time in the state of the economy we
included 2 measures: (1) the per capita gross
domestic product, and (2) the per capita
personal disposable income. These measures

 were obtained from the US Bureau of Eco-
nomic Analysis.34 Finally, we controlled for
the number of Catholic adherents per 1000
persons in each state by using data from the
Association of Religion Data Archives35 for
the years 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 and
interpolating to derive estimates for the in-
tervening years.
Model and Statistical Analysis
Our outcome variable—age-adjusted
suicide rates—was approximately normally
distributed. Therefore, we used a linear re-
gression model, which follows the approach
used in several previous studies.7,11–13,24,27
Because our data were a panel with multiple
observations each year (n = 50) and multiple
years of state data (n = 33), there were 2
sources of clustering. To account for clus-
tering by year, we included year as a fixed
effect in the regression models. To account
for clustering among states, we used a GEE
approach with robust variance estimators.
This follows the approach taken by Miller
et al. to account for clustering by region.25 In
the GEE models, we tested a variety of as-
sumptions about the nature of the working
correlation matrix. We chose the model with
the best fit—a correlation matrix with an
autoregressive structure—by selecting the
model with the lowest quasilikelihood under
the independence model criterion.
We ran 2 models: (1) a full model that
included all state-level variables, and (2)
a parsimonious final model that only included
variables significant according to a Wald test at
a level of .05, produced with a backward
stepwise regression procedure.
To ease the interpretation of regression
coefficients, we present the estimated changes

 Among the 50 states, the average percentage
of firearm ownership decreased from 45.6%
in 1981 to 36.5% in 2013 (P < .01).
Over the study period, the mean age-
adjusted firearm suicide rate among male in-
dividuals ranged from a low of 4.2 per 100000
in Massachusetts to a high of 26.1 per 100000
in Wyoming, with an average over all states
of 14.2 per 100000 (Table 1). The mean
age-adjusted firearm suicide rate among female
individuals over the study period ranged from
a low of 0.40 per 100000 in New York to
a high of 4.2 per 100000 in Nevada, with an
averageoverallstatesof2.1per100000.Among
the 50 states, the average male firearm suicide
rate decreased slightly from 14.5 per 100000 in
1981 to 13.9 per 100000 in 2013, and the
average female firearm suicide rate decreased
slightly from 2.6 per 100000 to 2.3 per 100000.
The average percentage of suicides in which
a firearm was used was consistently 1.6 times
higher among male (62.0% over study
period) than among female persons (39.1% over
study period; P< .01; data not shown). Among
both genders, the average proportion of suicides
in which a firearm was used decreased by
approximately 12% to 15% over the course
of the study period, from 65.5% during 1981
to 1990 to 57.8% during 2000 to 2013 among
male individuals and from 41.5% to 35.3%
among female individuals. All of these decreases
were statistically significant at the P< .01 level.
In bivariate analyses, there was a strong
correlation between state-level firearm
ownership and the adjusted firearm-related
suicide rate for both genders, with firearm
ownership explaining 71% of the variation
(R2 = 0.71) in the firearm suicide rate for
male individuals and 49% of the variation
(R2 = 0.49) in the firearm suicide rate for
female individuals (Figures 1 and 2).
In a bivariate analysis (a GEE linear re-
gression model with year fixed effects and
accounting for clustering by state, but without
any predictor variables besides firearm
ownership), the firearm ownership proxy
was a significant predictor of male firearm
suicide rates (increase of 3.3 per 100 000 for
each 10-percentage-point increase in firearm
ownership), male nonfirearm suicide rates
(decrease of 2.2 per 100 000 for each 10-
percentage-point increase in firearm own-
ership), and total suicide rates (increase of 1.6
per 100 000 for each 10-percentage-point
increase in firearm ownership; Table 2). For
female individuals, the firearm ownership
proxy was a significant predictor of firearm
suicide rates (increase of 0.5 per 100 000 for
each 10-percentage-point increase in firearm
ownership) and nonfirearm suicide rates
(decrease of 0.4 per 100 000 for each
10-percentage-point increase in firearm
ownership), but was not associated with
total suicide rates.
In the full multivariate GEE linear re-
gression models, the firearm ownership proxy
was a significant predictor of male firearm
suicide rates (increase of 3.1 per 100 000 for
each 10-percentage-point increase in firearm
ownership), male nonfirearm suicide rates
(decrease of 1.5 per 100 000 for each 10-
percentage-point increase in firearm own-
ership), and total suicide rates (increase of 1.9
per 100 000 for each 10-percentage-point
increase in firearm ownership; Table 2).
For female persons, the firearm ownership
proxy was a significant predictor of firearm
suicide rates (increase of 0.4 per 100 000 for
each 10-percentage-point increase in firearm
ownership) and nonfirearm suicide rates
(decrease of 0.5 per 100 000 for each 10-
percentage-point increase in firearm own-
ership), but was not associated with total
suicide rates. The same pattern emerged in the
final models.
To examine whether our use of a proxy for
household firearm ownership explains the
observed findings, we repeated the analyses in
2 ways: (1) using the traditional FS/S proxy,
and (2) restricting the analysis to the years
2001, 2002, and 2004 and using BRFSS
survey data on household firearm ownership.
The positive relationship between gun
ownership and the overall male suicide rate
remained significant when we used the FS/S
proxy (increase of 1.0 per 100 000 for each 10
percentage point increase in gun ownership)
and when we used only survey data (increase
of 1.7 per 100 000 for each 10-percentage-
point increase in gun ownership). The posi-
tive relationship between gun ownership and
female firearm suicide rates also remained
significant when we used the FS/S proxy
(increase of 0.6 per 100 000 for each 10-
percentage-point increase in gun
ownership) and when using only survey
data (increase of 0.5 per 100 000 for each
10-percentage-point increase in gun
ownership).
In the final models, other covariates that
consistently predicted higher suicide rates
were West region, higher alcohol con-
sumption, higher divorce rate, higher violent
crime rate, lower population density, and
lower per capita gross domestic product.
Each of these variables was also significantly
related to the main predictor variable (gun
ownership).

 DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the
most comprehensive analysis of the relationship
betweenfirearmownershipandgender-specific
suicide rates among the 50 US states. We found
a strong relationship between higher levels of
firearm ownership in a state and higher firearm
suicide rates for both genders. Among male
individuals, we also found a significant associ-
ation between higher firearm ownership and
higher overall suicide rates, but this relation-
ship did not hold for female individuals.
Our study adds to the consistent finding
that, among both genders, increased preva-
lence of firearms is associated with an increase
in the firearm-specific suicide rate. The
magnitude of this relationship is substantial.
Based on our model, if the firearm ownership
in Wyoming were 41.0% (the average for
all states) instead of 72.8%, its male firearm
suicide rate would be lower by 9.9 per
100 000 (a 38% decline), and its female fire-
arm suicide rate would be lower by 2.2 per
100 000 (a 56% decline).
Our findings also add to the evidence that
higher gun ownership is associated with
higher overall suicide rates among male
persons. Based on our model, if gun own-
ership in Wyoming were at the average for all
states (41.0%) instead of at 72.8%, the overall
male suicide rate in Wyoming would be
lower by 5.7 per 100 000 among male persons
(a 16% decline). Unlike a number of previous
studies,7,9,10,24,25 we did not find a relation-
ship between gun ownership and overall
suicide rates among female persons. Because
of these conflicting results, this issue warrants
further study.
Some have questioned whether the asso-
ciation between firearm ownership and ho-
micide deaths might be the result of a
so-called “reverse association”—that is, be-
cause there are many homicides in an area,
more people will obtain firearms to protect
themselves from that threat. A strength of
this study is that, unlike previous studies on
the relationship between firearm ownership
and homicide rates at the state level, the
observed association between firearm own-
ership and suicide rates is unlikely to be at-
tributable to a reverse association. Although it
is plausible that people might acquire more
firearms if there are more homicides occur-
ring near them, it does not seem likely that
people are responding to increased suicide
rates in their area by going out to purchase
more firearms for themselves. As Briggs and
Tabarrok have argued, the only plausible
source of reverse association is that an
individual may purchase a gun specifically
because of suicidal intent.11 However, this
would have almost no effect on gun own-
ership levels.11 Thus, we believe that the
observed association between increased fire-
arm ownership and higher firearm suicide is
a causal one.

 There are at least 2 potential explanations
for our observation of an increased suicide
rate by any method among male persons in
association with higher state-level firearm
ownership prevalence. First, it may be that at
least some suicides are impulsive and that the
ease with which a person can obtain a highly
lethal means of suicide (i.e., a firearm), the
more suicides will be completed.6,25 The
impulse to attempt suicide may wane rela-
tively quickly, such that the lack of ease in
finding a lethal means may allow enough time
to pass so that the suicidal impulse subsides or
intervention occurs.6,11 Second, as Miller
et al. argue, overall suicide rates may be
lowered by “reducing population-level access
to lethal means.”6(p401) Several natural ex-
periments have demonstrated that overall
suicide rates may be reduced by eliminating
lethal means, such as removing carbon
monoxide from gas used in ovens and heaters
in the United Kingdom, banning toxic pes-
ticides in Sri Lanka, and reducing soldiers’
access to firearms on weekends in Israel.6
One possible explanation for why we failed
to find an association between higher levels of
gun ownership and higher overall suicide rates
among female individuals is that women tend
to be less impulsive than men,36 so the reduced
availability of lethal means might not prevent
suicide as the suicidal ideation is more stable. In
contrast, men who have high impulsivity but
do not have easy access to a lethal means might
be more likely to experience a prompt reso-
lution of their impulsive suicidal ideation such
that the lack of a lethal means actually prevents
suicide altogether.
Limitations
There are several limitations of this
study. First, we used a proxy measure of
firearm ownership rather than self-report,
survey-based measures. However, we used
a well-established proxy variable that has
a correlation of 0.95 with survey-measured
gun ownership. To remedy this problem, the
CDC should reinstate self-reported firearm
ownership prevalence surveillance through its
BRFSS survey.
A second limitation is that this is a cross-
sectional study, so an unknown confounder
may explain the observed relationship.
However, because of the number and scope
of predictor variables we included in our
analysis, it is difficult to imagine a potential
confounder that would still be influential over
and above what is already included in the
models. Nevertheless, repeating this study
with a longitudinal design would help to
establish whether the observed relationship is
a causal one.
Public Health Implications
The public health implication of these
findings is that reductions in the prevalence of
firearms may be an effective strategy for re-
ducing overall and firearm-related suicides
among male persons and for reducing
firearm-related suicides among female per-
sons. As suicide is the 10th leading cause of
death in the United States, and firearm-
related deaths and injuries are extraordinarily
costly, reducing firearm-related self-
injury and suicide is a public health
imperative.

Note. CI = confidence interval.The values in the table represent the estimated change in the specified suicide
rate for each 10-percentage-point increase in the predictor variable. For example, a value of +1.6 indicates
that there is an increase of 1.6 per 100000 in the suicide rate for each 10-percentage-point increase in
household firearm ownership (e.g., comparing a state with 30% firearm ownership rate to a state with 40%
firearm ownership rate would indicate a suicide rate difference of 1.6 per 100000).
aBased on a generalized estimating equation linear regression model with year fixed effects and ac-
counting for clustering by state, but without any predictor variables besides firearm ownership.
bControlled for region, level of urbanization, population density, educational attainment, unemploy-
ment, median household income, per capita alcohol consumption, proportion of Catholic adherents,
nonhomicide violent crime rate (aggravated assault, robbery, and forcible rape), nonviolent (property)
crime rate (burglary, larceny theft, and motor vehicle theft), incarceration rate, divorce rate, per
capita gross domestic product, and per capita disposable personal income.
