IMPORTANCE Recovery from concussion generally follows a trajectory of gradual
improvement, but symptoms can abruptly worsen with exertion. This phenomenon is poorly
understood.
OBJECTIVES To characterize the incidence, course, and clinical significance of symptom
exacerbations (spikes) in children after concussion.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This secondary analysis of clinical trial data analyzes 63
eligible participants prospectively recruited from an emergency department who were asked
to complete a postconcussion symptom scale and record their activities in a structured diary
for the next 10 days. They completed standardized assessments of symptoms
(postconcussion symptom scale), cognition (Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and
Cognitive Testing), and balance (Balance Error Scoring System) 10 days following the injury.
Eligible participants were aged 11 to 18 years and sustained a concussion (according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria) that did not result in an abnormal
computed tomography scan or require hospital admission. The trial was conducted from
May 2010 to December 2012, and the analysis was conducted from November 2015 to
February 2016.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE The occurrence of symptom spikes, defined as an increase of
10 or more points on the postconcussion symptom scale over consecutive days.
RESULTS Of the 63 participants, there were 41 boys (65.1%) and 22 girls (34.9%), and the
mean (SD) age was 13.8 (1.8) years. Symptom spikes occurred in one-third of the sample (20
participants [31.7%]). Symptom spikes tended to partially resolve within 24 hours. An abrupt
increase in mental activity (ie, returning to school and extracurricular activities) from one day
to the next increased the risk of a symptom spike (relative risk, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.21-3.21), but
most symptom spikes were not preceded by a documented increase in physical or mental
activity. Patients with symptom spikes were initially more symptomatic in the emergency
department and throughout the observation period but did not differ from the group without
symptom spikes on cognition or balance 10 days following injury.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Certain patients appeared susceptible to high and variable
symptom reporting. Symptom spikes may not themselves be detrimental to recovery. The
present findings support clinical guidelines for adolescents to return to school and activities
gradually after concussion.

T
here is growing evidence that prolonged rest does not
facilitate recovery from concussion1-7 and concern that
it may be counterproductive to recovery.8-10 Contem-
porary clinical practice guidelines still caution that children
might need to rest for longer and progress through stages of
increased activity more slowly than adults.11,12 This appears
motivated by concern that the developing brain may be more
vulnerable to reinjury as well as excessive neurometabolic de-
mands during recovery from concussion.9,12 It has long been
observed that symptoms after concussion can be exacer-
bated by vigorous physical activity or resolve but then re-
emerge with physical exertion.13-17 Mental exertion (eg, sus-
tained concentration) can also provoke postconcussive
symptoms,18,19whichisparticularlyrelevanttoreturntoschool
planning after pediatric concussion.20
Little is currently known about the incidence, natural his-
tory, and clinical significance of activity-related symptom ex-
acerbations after pediatric concussion. The present study aims
to characterize symptom exacerbations (“spikes”) as well as
their antecedents and potential consequences. We con-
ducted a secondary analysis of data from a randomized clini-
cal trial4 of prescribed rest vs usual care for pediatric concus-
sion. Uniquely, this trial had participants keep a daily diary of
their activities and symptoms for the first 10 days after con-
cussion,permittingafine-grainedtemporalanalysisofchanges
in activity level and postconcussion symptoms.4 We pre-
dicted that high physical and mental activity would precede
symptom exacerbations. We further hypothesized that symp-
tom exacerbations would be transient and not raise the risk of
poor clinical outcome. The present findings could help guide
clinicians in advising patients when and how to return to their
preinjury activities after concussion.
Methods
Design
This is a secondary analysis of a prospective randomized clini-
caltrial4ofpatientspresentingtotheChildren’
sHospitalofWis-
consin emergency department (ED). The study was approved
by the Children’
s Hospital of Wisconsin Institutional Review
Board and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01101724).

giversandparticipants.Childrenwereeligibleiftheywereaged

Adolescents underwent an initial screening to gather demo-
graphic information and injury details. In the ED, partici-
pantsalsounderwentcomputerizedneurocognitivetestingand
astandardizedbalanceassessmentbyaresearchassistant.Par-
ticipants were then randomized to strict rest, in which ED phy-
sicians advised restricted school and extracurricular work and
physical exertion for 5 days, or to usual care, in which ED phy-
sicians were free to recommend activity restrictions as they
saw fit. Participants completed activity and symptom diaries
for the first 10 days after injury and had a follow-up appoint-
ment 10 days after their ED visit, which included the readmin-
istration of neurocognitive tests and balance assessments by
a research assistant.
Assessment and Outcome Measures
Physical and Mental Activity
Participants completed a daily diary that assessed type and
duration of physical and mental activities.22,23 Participants
were asked to record their physical activity at specified times
(eg, 15-minute intervals) throughout the day. Activities were
categorized according to their average energy costs, from the
lowest activity level, 1 (eg, sleep or rest in bed), to the highest
level, 9 (eg, sport participation). The diaries were analyzed by
adding the number of periods for each categorical value and
then multiplying by the basal metabolic rate multiplier for
each activity category22 and the predicted basal metabolic
rate of the individual participant, using the sex and weight
prediction formula.24 These values were then summed to
yield the total energy expenditure for each day. Activity-
related energy expenditure was then determined by subtract-
ing the basal metabolic rate from the total energy expendi-
ture. Participants also reported the time in hours spent on
specific mental activities each day. There exists neither a cri-
terion standard nor a validated scale to assess mental activ-
ity. Therefore, patients were asked to report the time spent
on specific mental activities, specifically those activities
patients were advised to limit on the Acute Concussion
Evaluation form21: school work (ie, attending class, home-
work, studying, and taking tests) and extracurricular partici-
pation. Listening to music, watching television, and surfing
the internet did not count as mental activity in the present
study.
Symptom Survey
A 19-item postconcussion symptom scale (PCSS), adapted
from Aubry et al,13 was included in the daily diary entry. Each
Key Points
Question How common and clinically significant are
activity-related symptom exacerbations after concussion?
Findings In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial,
63 children with a concussion were studied for 10 days after injury.
Symptom exacerbations were common, occurring in 1 of 3
participants, within the first 10 days of a concussion but appeared
largely transient, and they were not associated with impaired
balance or cognition. A major increase in activity associated with
returning to school and extracurricular activities doubled the risk
of a symptom exacerbation; however, most symptom
exacerbations were not preceded by mental or physical exertion.
Meaning Symptom exacerbations after concussion may not be
clinically significant events.

symptom was graded by the subject from none (0) to severe
(6) and was obtained daily for the first 10 days.
Neurocognitive Assessment
The Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive
Testing (ImPACT version 2.0; ImPACT Applications) comput-
erized test battery was used as a primary neurocognitive as-
sessment. This measure has been validated for use in the ED
setting, and it reliably detects neurocognitive deficits after
concussion.25,26Thetestadministers6neuropsychologicaltest

Balance Assessment
The Balance Error Scoring System objectively assesses
balance.27 The test consists of 3 stance conditions (ie, double
leg,singleleg,andtandem);eachstanceisperformedwitheyes
closedonnormalfirmflooringandamedium-densityfoamsur-
face. An inability to maintain the stance or keep eyes closed is
deemed an error. Performance was scored by adding the er-
ror points for all 6 trials.
Analyses
A symptom spike was defined as an increase of 10 or more
points on the PCSS over consecutive days, which corre-
sponded to a statistically reliable change (ie, exceeding the up-
per limit of the 95% CI for test-retest change in healthy con-
trols)onaverysimilarpostconcussionsymptomquestionnaire
(eAppendix in the Supplement).28 We restricted the analyses
to symptom spikes between days 2 and 9 postinjury so that we
could examine antecedents (eg, activity level on the day prior)
and consequences (eg, activity level on the day after) within
the 10-day observation period. The 63 participants (64% of
original sample) in the Thomas et al4 trial who contributed a
full 10 days of diary data were eligible for the present study.
Note that participants who were excluded for missing data did
not differ from eligible participants (with or without symp-
tom spikes) with regard to age, sex, randomization, or PCSS
scores in the ED (P > .05).
Linear mixed-effects models were used to test the null
hypotheses that symptoms, physical activity, and mental
activity all remained stable over the 10-day observation
period. Time (in days) was the covariate of interest. Sex and
randomization allocation (control vs strict rest advice) were
included as covariates in all mixed models. In all cases, mod-
els with both a random intercept and slope achieved a supe-
rior model fit (based on the Akaike Information Criterion)
compared with those with a random intercept only. There-
fore, the reported models contain random effects for the
intercept and slope.
Groups with and without symptom spikes were com-
pared on demographic and clinical variables with χ2 tests for
proportions and independent samples with t tests for con-
tinuous variables. Relative risk values were computed to
compare the rate of symptom spikes in participants who had
usual vs unusually high levels (>90th percentile for the full
sample) of activity and activity change over consecutive
days. Linear regression was used to determine if participants
with at least 1 symptom spike had worse outcomes at the
10-day in-person assessment, after controlling for potential
confounders.
Results
Time Trends
Symptoms decreased over the 10 days following injury in
the full sample (t = −7.50; P < .001). The 20 participants
with symptom spikes reported more symptoms over the
observation period than the 43 participants without symp-
toms spikes (t = 4.90; P < .001). As can be seen in Figure 1,
participants with symptom spikes started out with higher
PCSS scores and had a less steep symptom improvement
trajectory, whereas those with no symptom spikes followed
a more linear, uninterrupted symptom recovery course. Par-
ticipants who went on to have at least 1 symptom spike were
initially more symptomatic in the ED than participants
without symptom spikes (mean [SD] PCSS score, 40.6 [21.0]
vs 29.7 [18.2]; t60 = 2.07; P = .04; Cohen d, 0.54 [medium
effect size]). The individual trajectories for participants who
had symptom spikes were also more variable throughout
the observation period, with more prominent peaks and val-
leys. The SD for the daily PCSS score in the group without
symptom spikes gradually decreased but remained high in
the group with symptom spikes; the SD was twice as large in
the group with symptom spikes by day 6 (20.7 vs 9.4) and
thrice as large by day 9 (21.5 vs 7.3).
Next, we examined time trends for return to physical and
mental activity. Physical activity did not significantly in-
crease over the observation period (t = −0.29; P = .77). Men-
tal activity increased markedly over this period (t = 7.97;
P < .001). Note that the coefficients for sex and randomiza-
tion assignment (control vs strict rest advice) were nonsignifi-
cant in all models (P > .05), suggesting that these factors did
not influence symptom trajectories.
Frequency and Characteristics
of Symptom Spikes
Of the 20 participants with at least 1 symptom spike, 4 par-
ticipants had a second symptom spike, and no participant
had more than 2. The first symptom spike occurred on aver-
age on day 5 (interquartile range [IQR], 3-6). The first spike
was characterized by a mean (SD; IQR) increase of 50.3%
(21.6; 36.9%-62.2%) or 17.1 points (11.9; 11.0-18.0) on the
PCSS, followed by a mean (SD; IQR) decrease of 27.9% (36.6;
10.3%-52.8%) or 9.3 points (11.3; 3.3-15.0). By the day after
the first symptom spike, the PCSS score returned to or fell
below the PCSS score on the day prior to the symptom spike
in 12 children (60.0%). In the remaining 8 children (40.0%)
whose symptom exacerbation did not completely resolve,
the PCSS score decreased somewhat (ie, partially resolved
exacerbation) the day after the symptom spike in 4 children
(50.0%). The percentage change in PCSS score from the day
of the first symptom spike to the following day are reported
in Table 1. The course of participants’first symptom spikes
is also illustrated in Figure 2. To better understand the

nature of symptom spikes, Table 1 also includes the specific
postconcussive symptoms that increased at the individual-
patient level. These data suggest that symptom spikes were
not characterized by a particular symptom cluster. Rather,
there was tremendous between-subject variability in the
type of symptoms that contributed to a symptom spike.
Characteristics of Patients
Who Had Symptom Spikes
Participants with at least 1 symptom spike were similar to
participants without symptom spikes with respect to age,
sex, randomization assignment, presence of loss of con-
sciousness, and history of previous concussion(s). However,
participants with symptom spikes were initially more symp-
tomatic in the ED and on the following day, before we began
recording symptom spikes.
Activity Preceding Symptom Spikes
Activity-related energy expenditure was used to measure
physical activity. Mental activity was measured in hours per
day spent engaged in school and extracurricular activity. We
used the 90th percentile of the full sample (see eAppendix in
the Supplement for raw score cutoffs) to define an unusually
high level or change in activity, and we calculated relative
risk values for a symptom spike based on physical or mental
activity on the day the symptom spike occurred or over the
preceding 24 hours. Relative risk values greater than 1.0 indi-
cate that participants with unusually high activity were more
likely to experience a symptom spike. The results are pre-
sented in Table 2. The only significant predictor of a symp-
tom spike was an unusually high increase in mental activity
the day prior; a large and nongraduated increase in mental
activity from one day to the next was associated with an
increased risk of experiencing a symptom spike on that day.
However, of the 20 participants with at least 1 symptom
spike, only 5 (25.0%) demonstrated an activity-related symp-
tom spike. Most instances (38 of 43 [88.4%]) of an unusually
large increase in mental activity were not followed by a
symptom spike, and most symptom spikes (20 of 24 [83.3%])
were not preceded by an unusually high increase in mental
activity.
Clinical Outcome
In a series of regression models, we examined whether hav-
ing at least 1 symptom spike between 2 and 9 days after
injury was associated with symptoms, cognition, and bal-
ance in the clinical assessment conducted 10 days after
injury. Participants’randomization assignment (1, control; 2,
strict rest advice) and initial score (obtained in the ED) on
the outcome measure of interest were included as covariates

Discussion
The present study characterized symptom exacerbations dur-
ing the first 10 days after pediatric concussion. There were
several key findings. Symptom spikes occurred in nearly a
third of patients. They were more likely to occur in patients
who reported a high symptom burden when initially evalu-
ated in the ED but not in those with a loss of consciousness,
prior concussion(s), or certain demographic features (eg, age
and sex). We observed that symptom spikes were not charac-
terized by a specific symptom (eg, headache) or symptom
cluster and tended to diminish or completely resolve within
24 hours. Contrary to our hypothesis, symptom spikes were
not associated with physical activity or the absolute mental
activity level on the day of the symptom spike or the day
prior. However, they were associated with a sharp increase in
mental activity over the preceding 24 hours (eg, returning to
school and extracurricular activities relatively abruptly).
Finally, symptom spikes were associated with higher symp-
tom reporting but not cognitive function or balance 10 days
after injury.
To our knowledge, the present study is the first to dem-
onstrate a temporal association between increased mental ac-
tivity and symptom exacerbations outside of the laboratory.
Youths who sharply increased their school participation from
one day to the next were more likely to experience a symp-
tom spike the following day. However, it should be empha-
sized that most children were able to return to school (even
abruptly)withoutexperiencingasymptomspikeandthatmost
symptom spikes were not related to activity. The diversity of
symptoms that increased in each symptom spike further sug-
gests that factors other than exertion (such as stress29 and
sleep30,31) likely contribute to daily fluctuations in postcon-
cussion symptoms.
Many questions about activity-related symptom exacer-
bations remain unanswered. First, the time course of increas-
ing activity and escalating symptoms is not clear. Symptoms
and activity were measured on a daily basis, and some asso-
ciation between those 2 variables was found. However, the as-
sociation may have been stronger if we measured both vari-
ableswithgreatergranularity(eg,hourly).Second,becauseour
last data point was obtained at 10 days following injury, we do
not know whether acute symptom exacerbations were asso-
ciated with worse longer-term outcomes or whether the as-
sociation was a causal one. The finding that patients who had
a symptom spike were more symptomatic before the symp-
tom spike and had more variable trajectories throughout the
observation period leads us to hypothesize that unmeasured
injury or patient characteristics might predispose some indi-
viduals to both high and variable postconcussion symptom re-
portingatanytime.Finally,themechanismunderlyingactivity-
related symptom exacerbations is unknown. Persistent
impairments in neurometabolism17 and autonomic cerebro-
vascular regulation32 have both been proposed but not veri-
fied empirically.
The present study has important limitations. First, physi-
cal activity was measured using diary entries. It would have
been preferable to measure physical activity objectively, such
as with actigraphy. However, objectively measuring mental
activity in daily life is not feasible. Second, our sample size
was modest, especially for participants with activity-related
exacerbations. We likely did not have sufficient statistical
power to detect small effect sizes. The small sample size also
raises the risk of spurious results. Our novel findings require
replication in future larger studies. Third, participants in the
present study were randomized to receive different ED dis-
charge instructions about when to start gradually resuming
their preinjury activities.4 Although compliance with pre-
scribed rest was variable for physical activity and moderate
for mental activity,4 we cannot consider the present cohort to
be strictly observational. To mitigate the potential effect of
prescribed rest instructions, we included the randomization
allocation as a covariate in our analyses, which was consis-
tently nonsignificant. Fourth, limiting our sample to partici-
pants with complete diary data enabled us to accurately
identify symptom spikes during the observation period but

Conclusions
The present study is an important first step toward character-
izing the incidence, natural history, and clinical significance
of symptom spikes after pediatric concussion. We tentatively
concludethatsymptomexacerbationsfromonedaytothenext
are common, largely transient, and not specific to a particu-
lar symptom domain. Returning to full days of school raises
the risk of a symptom spike on the following day. However,
symptom spikes may not be clinically significant events. Fur-
ther research is needed to determine the causes and conse-
quences of symptom spikes. In the interim, our findings sup-
port continuing to advise children to return to activities
gradually and in a manner that does not significantly exacer-
bate symptoms,11 because even a transient worsening might
provoke anxiety and interfere with school reintegration. The
present findings do not provide a rationale for delaying when
children can start to gradually return to activity after concus-
sion (ie, prolonged rest). When a child or adolescent presents
to medical attention with concern about a sudden increase in
postconcussion symptoms, clinicians are encouraged to in-
quire about changes in daily activity as well as other potential
triggers, such as stress and sleep. Until the mechanisms and
long-term consequences of symptom exacerbations are bet-
terunderstood,itmaybeprudenttomonitortheseyouthsmore
regularly while being mindful that most will resume a trajec-
tory of improving symptoms within 24 hours and not have
worsened cognition or balance.
