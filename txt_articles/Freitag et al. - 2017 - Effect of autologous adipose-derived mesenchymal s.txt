Summary
Isolated chondral defects have a limited capacity to heal 
and predispose to the development of osteoarthritis. 
Current surgical management can be unpredictable 
in outcome. Improved understanding of the action of 
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has seen renewed 
interest in their role in cartilage repair. A 26-year-old 
athlete presented with a post-traumatic, isolated patella 
chondral defect. The patient underwent an arthroscopy 
with removal of a chondral loose body. After failure to 
symptomatically improve 12 months following surgery, 
the patient received intra-articular autologous adipose-
derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADMSC) therapy.
Background
The management of post-traumatic isolated chon-
dral defects poses a particular challenge to treating 
clinicians. It is recognised that articular cartilage has 
a limited capacity to heal.1 2 Furthermore, several 
studies have shown that isolated defects predispose 
a patient to later development of progressive and 
generalised degenerative osteoarthritis.3 4
The chosen management path for isolated chon-
dral defects can be influenced by factors including 
patient age, partial-thickness or full-thickness chon-
dral loss and the site of the lesion. Given the concern 
regarding early progression to osteoarthritis, 
surgical interventions are often considered. These 
can include, but are not limited to, arthroscopic 
debridement, microfracture/osteoplasty and, where 
appropriate, techniques such as autologous chon-
drocyte implantation (ACI) or matrix-induced 
autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI).
Microfracture, otherwise known as osteoplasty, is 
a commonly used and accepted technique whereby 
holes are drilled or punched through the subchon-
dral plate at the site of full-thickness cartilage loss 
and is designed to stimulate a healing response. It 
has been postulated that this method encourages 
the subsequent migration of bone marrow pluripo-
tent stem cells to the area of injury creating an envi-
ronment amenable to healing.5
Unfortunately while studies have successfully 
shown cartilaginous response at the site of microfrac-
ture, subsequent histological analysis has indicated 
type I fibrocartilage formation rather than hyaline 
cartilage.6 7 Additional studies have shown only fair 
to poor clinical outcome in long-term follow-up.8 
Inadequate defect filling and reduced load-bearing 
properties of fibrocartilage have been postulated 
as the reasoning behind disappointing long-term 
outcome results. Additional understanding of the 
relative paucity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) 
within bone marrow—as little as 0.001% in bone 
marrow aspirates—may also explain the inability to 
form hyaline-like cartilage.9 10
Chondrocyte implantation techniques such as 
ACI and MACI have shown encouraging results in 
the management of isolated chondral defects. Both 
preclinical and clinical trials have indicated hyaline-
like cartilage regrowth, and correspondingly long-
term clinical trials have observed encouraging 
durability in structure and patient outcome.11–15 
The application of such interventions unfortunately 
remains limited due to the need to do additional 
surgery in harvesting the donor autograft cartilage, 
subsequent donor site morbidity and the observed 
poor integration of the grafted defect with the 
surrounding cartilage.16 The site of chondral defect 
has also influenced observed outcome. While reli-
able results are achieved with lesions involving the 
medial or lateral femoral condyle, lesions of the 
patellofemoral joint are not associated with such 
reproducible results.17
Given an improved understanding of the 
pathology of chondral defects, their inherent 
inability to heal and the limitations of current 
surgical management techniques, there has been 
renewed focus in the area of regenerative medi-
cine techniques including MSCs. MSCs have the 
capacity to differentiate along a mesodermal cell 
lineage including adipocytes, osteoblasts and chon-
drocytes.18–20 In vitro studies have also shown that 
several growth factors—including transforming 
growth factor beta 1, insulin-like growth factor 1 
and bone morphogenic proteins—can act synergis-
tically to stimulate MSCs towards chondrocytes.21 
Importantly, MSC-derived chondrocytes exhibit 
the same expression of type II collagen as mature 
adult chondrocytes.21
Whilst initial interest in the potential role 
of MSCs in joint repair was based on the evidence 
of their ability to differentiate into both cartilage 
and bone, it is now apparent that this may not be 
their primary path of action. Rather, it is antici-
pated that their ability to influence and stimulate 
healing may, in fact, be through paracrine mech-
anisms involving both immune-modulatory and 
trophic pathways.22–24

novel treatment (new drug/intervention; established drug/procedure in new situation)
MSCs are observed to directly modulate the inflammatory 
response by the suppression of inflammatory T-cell proliferation 
and inhibition of monocyte and myeloid dendritic cell matura-
tion.24 The acknowledged cascade of inflammatory pathways 
mediated by cytokines including interleukin 1, tumour necrosis 
factor alpha and matrix metallopeptidases indicates the possible 
role that MSCs may have in inhibiting the cytokine lead degra-
dation of cartilage.25–27
In addition, MSC secretion of essential reparative cytokines, 
including transforming growth factor beta, vascular endothelial 
growth factor and epidermal growth factor, may be respon-
sible for a trophic effect resulting in local tissue repair.28–30 This 
trophic role, rather than direct chondrocyte transformation, is 
supported by the observation that in vitro coculture of MSCs 
with chondrocytes results in upregulation of collagen matrix 
formation, despite only minor chondrogenic differentiation of 
MSCs.31
Preclinical animal trials assessing chondral defect repair 
have indicated successful results using MSC-impregnated scaf-
folds.32 33 Histological analysis has also confirmed hyaline-like 
cartilage repair in chondral defects treated by microfracture 
in combination with MSC therapy.34 35 Furthermore, Lee and 
colleagues36, in a surgically induced chondral defect porcine 
model, showed improved cartilage regeneration with the use of 
intra-articular injections of bone marrow-derived MSCs.
Within the human literature, there is supportive evidence of 
the potential efficacy of MSC in chondral defect management, 
though this has been limited to studies involving surgical implan-
tation or cointervention. The use of MSC-impregnated scaffolds 
has resulted in both type II hyaline cartilage formation and 
equivalent results in direct comparison to ACI techniques.37 38 
Histological and MRI analysis of chondral defects following 
arthroscopic subchondral drilling (a variant of microfracture) in 
combination with MSC therapy indicated statistically significant 
improvement in cartilage quality when compared with subchon-
dral drilling without MSC therapy.39 The authors of this case 
report are involved in a current randomised controlled trial 
(RCT) on the use of MSCs in combination with microfracture 
in isolated chondral defects of the medial and lateral femoral 
condyle.40
The preclinical and clinical investigation of the possible role of 
MSCs in the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions including 
chondral defects continues to grow. The National Institute of 
Health lists 652 current trials in the area of MSCs.41
caSe preSenTaTion
A 26-year-old national representative in karate presented with 
patellofemoral pain following a competition-related traumatic 
patella dislocation. The patient had manually reduced the 
patella. She was otherwise well and worked as a personal trainer.
Initial examination indicated an effusion, a positive patella 
apprehension test, reduced range in motion (5°–135°) and 
stability on cruciate and collateral ligament testing. Subsequent 
MRI indicated features of previous patella dislocation with 
subchondral boney oedema of the patella and lateral femoral 
condyle and disruption of the medial patellofemoral ligament. 
The medial facet of the patella had evidence of a full-thickness 
chondral defect measuring 10 
mm in width with a loose chondral 
body in the medial femoral gutter of the knee joint (figures 1 
and 2).
The patient underwent arthroscopic surgery where the 
10 
mm×10 
mm medial patella facet defect was noted and chon-
droplasty was performed to unstable areas of chondral surface. 
A small loose chondral body corresponding to the defect site was 
removed but was unable to be transplanted back due to size and 
the lack of an osteochondral layer. A medial longitudinal inci-
sion was made with repair of the medial patellofemoral ligament 
using a double-breasted suturing technique. The patient’s knee 
was immobilised in a splint for a period of 2 
weeks to protect the 
patellofemoral ligament repair, after which progressive range of

novel treatment (new drug/intervention; established drug/procedure in new situation)
motion exercises and rehabilitation were instructed and guided 
by a treating physiotherapist.
Despite progressive and directed rehabilitation, the patient 
had persistent patellofemoral discomfort 9 
months following 
her injury. She was unable to return to karate and was signifi-
cantly limited in her occupation as a personal trainer. After 
consultation with a sports physician, the patient trialled a course 
of autologous platelet–rich plasma with no observed symp-
tomatic improvement after completing a course of three injec-
tions. Repeat MRI indicated a persistent patella chondral defect 
measuring 12 
mm at its widest diameter (figure 3).
After careful consideration, and due to persistent pain 
and dysfunction 12 
months following her initial injury, the 
patient underwent a repeat arthroscopy with the intention of 
arthroscopic microfracture to the area of full-thickness chon-
dral loss with planned postoperative autologous adipose-derived 
MSC (ADMSC) therapy. At the time of arthroscopy, a thin layer 
of fibrocartilage was noted at the base of the chondral defect and 
a decision was made not to disrupt this layer with microfracture 
(figure 4). The patient later underwent intra-articular injections 
of autologous ADMSCs.
Whilst alternative treatment using MACI was considered,it 
was felt that due to factors including donor site morbidity, 
difficulty of surgery and chondral defect site, that MACIwould 
be trialled only if ADMSC therapy failed.
The patient received written information regarding the use of 
MSC therapy, including the documented relative risks. Formal 
written consent was completed prior to commencement of 
treatment.

TreaTmenT
autologous adipose-derived mSc preparation
Source of MSCs
Adipose tissue was chosen as a source of autologous MSCs due 
to the observed comparative chondrogenic ability of adipose 
versus bone marrow-derived MSCs, the relative abundance of 
MSCs within adipose tissue and the ease of harvest.9 42 While 
bone marrow aspirate was considered as an alternative cell 
source, it has a paucity of MSCs—comprising 0.001%–0.02% of 
the mono-nucleated cell population, in comparison to ~1%–7% 
of the mono-nucleated cell population within adipose tissue.9 10
Harvest procedure
The patient underwent an abdominal lipoharvest procedure. A 
single dose of prophylactic antibiotics was administered prior to 
commencement of the lipoharvest in accordance with accepted 
routine clinical practice.43
Tumescent fluid comprising 30 mL of 2% lignocaine, 1 
mL of 
1:1000 epinephrine and 1 
mL of 8.4% bicarbonate suspended in 
normal saline (a total of 1000 mL) was prepared. Three hundred 
millilitres of this preparation was infiltrated to the abdominal 
subcutaneous fat plane using a blunt tumescence cannula. Using 
a 3 
mm lipo-aspirate cannula, 65 mL of lipoaspirate (adipose 
tissue and tumescent fluid) was aspirated and collected in a 
sterile single use Shippert Tissu-Trans Collection filter (Ship-
pert Medical, Centennial, Colorado, USA). The lipoaspirate was 
transferred directly to a clean room laboratory from the theatre 
via a pass through hatch with an air lock system.
Isolation and expansion of MSCs
Isolation and expansion of autologous ADMSCs was under-
taken using techniques that have been previously published.44 
Processing of the lipoaspirate was performed under strict sterile 
conditions within a Biological Safety Cabinet Class II and within

novel treatment (new drug/intervention; established drug/procedure in new situation)
a clean room laboratory with equivalent ISO 5 or above air 
quality.
Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) was isolated from the 
harvested adipose tissue using enzymatic digestion and centrifu-
gation. The SVF was then culture purified under hypoxic condi-
tions within standard growth media containing 10% fetal bovine 
serum (FBS) (HyClone—GE Healthcare, Chicago, Illinois, USA). 
Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with sterile phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS) and adherent cells further cultured 
until 80% confluency. Cells were harvested at passage 0 (P0) and 
further plated to tissue culture flasks and expanded up to passage 
2 (P2). At completion of P2, cells were harvested, washed three 
times to remove FBS and cryopreserved in clinical-grade qual-
ified MSC cryoprotectant media using a validated control rate 
freezing method of 1°C/min.45 46 The cryovials were stored in 
liquid nitrogen until use.
Characterisation and sterility testing
Characterisation of the isolated cell population was confirmed 
using standards established by the International Society of 
Cellular Therapy.47 Phenotypic analysis using a flow cytom-
etry Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) technique was 
performed independently at Monash University. Using fluores-
cent-labelled antibodies, a sample of the isolated cell population 
was assessed for the presence of MSC surface markers CD90, 
CD73 and CD105 and absence of haematopoietic surface 
markers CD14, CD19, CD34 and CD45 (figure 5 and table 1).
A cell sample was sent for independent sterility testing for 
microbial growth/contamination.
injection method
Prior to injection, the stored cells were thawed using a sterile 
water bath with the cyroprotectant media separated from the 
stem cells using both centrifugation and washing in chilled 
PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in injectable clinical-grade 
isotonic (0.9%) normal saline to a total of 3 mL. Cell number 
and viability was confirmed using a Muse Cell Analyzer (Merck 
Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA). The MSC preparation 
was injected within 30 
min of thawing.
The patient received intra-articular ADMSC therapy at 0 and 
6 months.
At commencement of therapy, the patient received a total of 
105 
million ADMSCs (viability 94%). The patient received a 
second injection of 112 
million ADMSCs (viability 97.8%) at 6 
months.
At both times of injection, the patient’s knee was prepped 
using standard sterile procedural protocols. T
wo millilitres of 1% 
lignocaine was infiltrated to the subcutaneous tissue at the site 
of the injection. Using ultrasound guidance and under aseptic 
conditions, the autologous ADMSCs suspended within 3 mL of 
normal saline was injected into the intra-articular knee space.
postinjection rehabilitation
The patient was given postinjection rehabilitation guidelines 
including range of motion and muscle activation exercises. They 
were allowed to weight bear as tolerated. A formal strengthening 
programme was commenced under physiotherapist supervision.
analysis method and outcome measures
The patient completed validated outcome questionnaires 
using the software programme Clinical Intelligence (Clinical 
Intelligence, Melbourne, Australia). Outcome measures were 
completed at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. These measures 
included:
 
►
The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). 
This validated score consists of five subscales: pain, symp-
toms, function in daily living, function in sport and recre-
ation and knee-related quality of life. Standardised answers

cell sample, respectively. The cell population was positive for CD90, CD73 and CD105 and negative for CD14, CD19, CD34 and CD45 surface markers. 
Dot blot analysis indicated that 90.09% of cells were positive for CD90 and CD105, whereas 99.3% of cells were positive for CD90 and CD73. 
Furthermore, only 0.1% of cells expressed CD19 and CD14 surface markers and similarly 0.2% expressed both CD45 and CD34.

The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). The patient is asked 
to rate their knee pain intensity over the previous week on 
a scale of 0–10. The NPRS has been validated for use in 
people with knee osteoarthritis.50
Structural outcome was assessed using MRI and was performed 
prior to the commencement of therapy and again at 12 months 
follow-up. The cartilage defect was described using semiquan-
titative measures defined by a modified International Cartilage 
Repair Society (ICRS) score51 :
 
►
Grade 0: normal cartilage
 
►
Grade 1: focal blistering and intracartilaginous low-signal 
intensity area with an intact surface and bottom
 
►
Grade 2: irregularities on the surface or bottom and loss of 
thickness of less than 50%
 
►
Grade 3: deep ulceration with loss of thickness of more than 
50%
 
►
Grade 4: full-thickness cartilage wear with exposure of 
subchondral bone.
Cartilage quality was assessed using the validated non-inva-
sive MRI technique of T2 relaxation time cartilage mapping.52 
Previous publications have shown that increased cartilage water 
content reproducibly alters T2 relaxation time and is an indi-
cator of abnormal cartilage pathology.53
ouTcome and Follow-up
pain and functional outcome
Following commencement of ADMSC therapy, the patient 
experienced progressive improvement in pain with her NPRS 
improving from 8 at baseline to 2 within 3 months. This 
improvement remained consistent, although it had increased to 
3 at conclusion of follow-up (figure 6).
Quality of life as recorded by the Global WOMAC score 
consistently improved with scores increasing from 64 at baseline 
to 92 at 12 months—a total improvement of 43% (figure 7).
Reflecting the improvement observed in the WOMAC score, 
all separate KOOS parameters showed improvement across the 
follow-up period (figure 8). At 12 months, the symptom score 
had improved by over 635% and similarly sport and recreation 
by 700%. Quality of life as measured by KOOS improved by 
41% showing consistency in comparison to the WOMAC score.
Structural outcome
Structural follow-up using MRI showed significant improvement 
with complete filling of the chondral defect. The modified ICRS 
score, improved from Grade 3 to Grade 0 with smooth inte-
gration between the new cartilage and the surrounding native 
cartilage (figure 9).
T2-mapping techniques showed consistent values <40 through 
the deep and superficial areas of the regenerated tissue. This 
indicated normal hyaline-like cartilage morphology (figure 10).
complications and adverse events
There were no significant complications documented during 
the course of treatment. The patient experienced mild bruising 
at the site of abdominal liposuction, which resolved within 4 
weeks. Furthermore, the patient experienced pain and swelling 
of the knee following both the 0-month and 6-month intra-ar-
ticular ADMSC injections. These episodes were self-limiting,

diScuSSion
This case study shows the successful management of a post-trau-
matic chondral defect using intra-articular autologous ADMSC 
therapy. The patient had previously failed to have symptom-
atic improvement following a course of autologous platelet-rich 
plasma.
Current techniques for the treatment of isolated chondral 
defects include arthroscopic microfracture and ACI. Microf-
racture is limited due to observed fibrocartilage formation and 
poor long-term outcome.5–7 ACI techniques, while having noted 
reasonable long-term success, are limited by issues including 
surgical difficulty, donor site morbidity, poor integration with 
surrounding tissue and chondrocyte hypertrophy.16 54 Further-
more, the location of this patient’s chondral defect, the medial 
facet of the patella, has not been associated with reproducible 
improvement following ACI intervention.17
The initial intention was to treat the patient using a combined 
microfracture and MSC therapy protocol similar to that 
which has previously been published and which the authors 
are conducting a current RCT.39 40 Surprisingly, at the time of 
arthroscopy, there was an observed thin layer of fibrocartilage at 
the base of the chondral defect and it was chosen not to disrupt 
this area with microfracture.
Following commencement of ADMSC therapy, quantitative 
pain and functional outcome assessment using validated ques-
tionnaires all showed consistent improvement across the course 
of follow-up. This improvement was mirrored by structural 
improvements observed on MRI with complete fill of the chon-
dral defect and smooth integration with the surrounding native 
cartilage. Complications not uncommon to current surgical 
management techniques such as ACI/MACI or microfracture—
including poor tissue integration, tissue overgrowth and osseous 
formation—were not observed.
MRI T2-mapping techniques indicated normal hyaline-like 
cartilage regeneration with values similar to native cartilage. Past 
research has confirmed a significant correlation between compa-
rable T2-mapping values of repair tissue and native cartilage 
and long-term positive outcome.55 The apparent robust chon-
drogenesis seen with ADMSCs in this case study is in contrast 
to prior in vitro analysis, which has indicated greater cartilag-
inous tissue deposition associated with bone marrow-derived 
MCSs over ADMSCs.56 While it is accepted that an arthroscopic 
biopsy would have provided definitive proof of cartilage histo-
pathology, this invasive investigation was not felt to be justifiable 
due to the significant improvement in the patient’s symptoms.
No serious adverse events were recorded during the follow-up 
period of 12 months. A self-limited flare up in pain was noted and 
is consistent with observations made in past clinical studies and 
suggests that intra-articular MSC injections are well tolerated.39
Current management of isolated chondral defects includes 
surgical interventions that are associated with patient comor-
bidity (ie, chondral biopsy), complications and unpredictable 
long-term outcome. Prior published reparative methods involving 
MSCs have used similar surgical cointerventions (microfracture) 
or transplantation techniques similar to ACI/MACI, whereby 
chondrocytes are replaced with MSCs. While past preclinical 
studies have indicated the ability of intra-articular injections to 
assist in cartilage healing, this is the first documented clinical 
case report of the successful use of this minimally invasive tech-
nique in the management of isolated chondral defects.
Whether MSCs directly differentiate into chondrocytes and 
rebuild cartilage is yet to be confirmed. Past studies have failed to 
consistently show integration of MSCs within articular cartilage

novel treatment (new drug/intervention; established drug/procedure in new situation)
and this suggests that the action of MSCs may be more through cell-
to-cell contact and paracrine mechanisms.24 31 57 58 The observed 
limited layer of fibrocartilage at site of injury at arthroscopy and 
later robust cartilage regrowth after MSC therapy indicates the 
ability of MSCs to manipulate and amplify a reparative pathway.
It should be recognised that conclusions from this case are 
limited by the nature of a singular case study and they may not 
be reflected in a more vigorous and expansive controlled trial. 
Furthermore, the lesion was subacute with the traumatic chon-
dral initial injury 12 months prior. Whether intra-articular MSC 
injections at the time of injury result in the same response or 
defects at other locations within the knee respond similarly is yet 
to be determined.
In this limited case study, the use of autologous ADMSC 
intra-articular injections, following a traumatic chondral defect 
of the patella, resulted in significant pain and functional improve-
ments and importantly complete regeneration of hyaline-like 
cartilage within the defect. This is an extremely encouraging 
finding and unique to this study. The procedure was well toler-
ated with no serious adverse events recorded. This offers an 
exciting possibility in the minimally invasive management of 
post-traumatic chondral lesions without the observed limitations 
associated with current surgical management options including 
microfracture or ACI/MACI techniques.
This case study demonstrates the possible benefits of MSC 
therapy in musculoskeletal conditions and highlights the impor-
tance of further well-structured research in this area.
learning points
 
► Post-traumatic chondral defects predispose to 
the development of generalised degenerative osteoarthritis.
 
► Current surgical methods for the treatment of isolated 
chondral defects are limited by surgical difficulty, patient 
morbidity and inconsistent long-term outcome.
