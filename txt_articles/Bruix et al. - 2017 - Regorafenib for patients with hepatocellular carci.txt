Summary
Background There are no systemic treatments for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) whose disease 
progresses during sorafenib treatment. We aimed to assess the effi
  cacy and safety of regorafenib in patients with 
HCC who have progressed during sorafenib treatment.
Methods In this randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 trial done at 152 sites in 21 countries, adults with 
HCC who tolerated sorafenib (≥400 mg/day for ≥20 of last 28 days of treatment), progressed on sorafenib, and had 
Child-Pugh A liver function were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) by a computer-generated 
randomisation list and interactive voice response system and stratifi
 ed by geographical region, Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group performance status, macrovascular invasion, extrahepatic disease, and α-fetoprotein level to best 
supportive care plus oral regorafenib 160 mg or placebo once daily during weeks 1–3 of each 4-week cycle. Investigators, 
patients, and the funder were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival (defi
 ned as 
time from randomisation to death due to any cause) and analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01774344.
Findings Between May 14, 2013, and Dec 31, 2015, 843 patients were screened, of whom 573 were enrolled and 
randomised (379 to regorafenib and 194 to placebo; population for effi
  cacy analyses), and 567 initiated treatment 
(374 received regorafenib and 193 received placebo; population for safety analyses). Regorafenib improved overall 
survival with a hazard ratio of 0·63 (95% CI 0·50–0·79; one-sided p<0·0001); median survival was 10·6 months 
(95% CI 9·1–12·1) for regorafenib versus 7·8 months (6·3–8·8) for placebo. Adverse events were reported in all 
regorafenib recipients (374 [100%] of 374) and 179 (93%) of 193 placebo recipients. The most common clinically 
relevant grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent events were hypertension (57 patients [15%] in the regorafenib group vs 
nine patients [5%] in the placebo group), hand–foot skin reaction (47 patients [13%] vs one [1%]), fatigue (34 patients 
[9%] vs nine patients [5%]), and diarrhoea (12 patients [3%] vs no patients). Of the 88 deaths (grade 5 adverse events) 
reported during the study (50 patients [13%] assigned to regorafenib and 38 [20%] assigned to placebo), seven (2%) 
were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug in the regorafenib group and two (1%) in the placebo 
group, including two patients (1%) with hepatic failure in the placebo group.
Interpretation Regorafenib is the only systemic treatment shown to provide survival benefi
 t in HCC patients 
progressing on sorafenib treatment. Future trials should explore combinations of regorafenib with other systemic 
agents and third-line treatments for patients who fail or who do not tolerate the sequence of sorafenib and 
regorafenib.

Introduction
The treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
follows well established guidelines.1–3 Surgical resection, 
trans 
plantation, and ablation are potential curative 
options for early-stage disease, whereas chemo-
embolisation is recommended for patients with 
preserved liver function and disease confi
 ned to the 
liver generally without vascular invasion. For patients 
who are not or who are no longer candidates for 
locoregional therapy, the oral multikinase inhibitor 
sorafenib is the only systemic treatment shown to 
provide a clinically signifi
 cant improvement in overall 
survival.4,5 Since the results with sorafenib were 
published almost 10 years ago, all phase 3 trials 
assessing novel systemic drugs have failed to improve 
outcomes over sorafenib in the fi
 rst-line setting6–10 or in 
the second-line setting following sorafenib.11–14 In 
second-line trials in patients who have failed sorafenib, 
overall survival in the placebo group is about 
8 months.11–14 Therefore, there is an unmet need for 
eff
 ective systemic therapies for HCC, particularly after 
treatment with sorafenib.

Regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that blocks 
the activity of protein kinases involved in angiogenesis, 
oncogenesis, metastasis, and tumour immunity.15,16 It has 
a distinct molecular target profi
 le and had more potent 
pharmacological activity than sorafenib in preclinical 
studies.15,17 Regorafenib is approved as monotherapy for 
the 
treatment 
of 
treatment-refractory 
metastatic 
colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumours at 
a dose of 160 mg once daily for the fi
 rst 3 weeks of each 
4-week cycle.18–20 Based on results of a single-arm phase 2 
study showing antitumour activity and acceptable 
tolerability,21 we aimed to assess the effi
  cacy and safety of 
regorafenib in patients with HCC who progressed during 
sorafenib treatment.
Methods
Study design and participants
This 
randomised, 
double-blind, 
placebo-controlled 
international phase 3 trial was done at 152 centres in 
21 countries in North America, South America, Europe, 
Asia, and Australia.
Eligible patients were adults with HCC confi
 rmed by 
pathological assessment or non-invasive assessment 
according to the American Association for the Study of 
Liver Diseases criteria for patients with confi
 rmed 
cirrhosis,1 and had to have at least one measurable lesion 
by modifi
 ed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors for HCC (mRECIST)22 and RECIST version 1.1. 
Patients were Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 
stage B or C,23 could not benefi
 t from resection, local 
ablation, or chemoembolisation, and must have had 
documented radiological progression during sorafenib 
treatment as defi
 ned in a study-specifi
 c radiology charter. 
They must have tolerated sorafenib (≥400 mg daily for at 
least 20 of the 28 days before discontinuation) and 
received their last sorafenib dose within 10 weeks of 
randomisation. They were required to have Child-Pugh A 
liver function. Patients were excluded if they had received 
any other previous systemic treatment for HCC or if they 
discontinued sorafenib for toxicity (see appendix pp 5–7 
for full inclusion and exclusion criteria).
All patients provided written informed consent. The 
trial was approved by each centre’s ethics committee or 
institutional review board and complied with Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, 
and applicable local laws.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to regorafenib or 
placebo using a computer-generated randomisation list 
prepared by the funder. Randomisation was stratifi
 ed by 
geographical region (Asia vs rest of world), macrovascular 
invasion (yes vs no), extrahepatic disease (yes vs no), 
α-fetoprotein concentration (<400 ng/mL vs ≥400 ng/mL), 
and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status (0 vs 1). The proportion of patients 
recruited from Asia was limited to 40%. Investigators, 
patients, and the funder were masked to treatment 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published between Jan 1, 2008, 
and Oct 26, 2016, with no language restrictions, reporting on 
the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) who failed sorafenib treatment using the 
search terms (”advanced hepatocellular carcinoma” OR 
“advanced hepatocellular cancer”) AND “sorafenib”, fi
 ltering for 
articles describing phase 3 clinical trials. We also searched 
abstracts of the annual meeting of the American Society of 
Clinical Oncology, using the search term “advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma’’, limiting the results to phase 3 trials 
published or presented during the past 2 years. The search 
resulted in 15 articles or abstracts, of which three were excluded 
(two subanalyses and one report of maintenance sorafenib 
therapy following the combination of transcatheter arterial 
chemoembolisation and radiotherapy). Of the remaining 
12 publications, two were reports of the pivotal trials of 
sorafenib for advanced HCC; fi
 ve reported the fi
 rst-line use of a 
novel drug or the novel combination of a drug with sorafenib 
compared with a sorafenib control; and fi
 ve reported the 
second-line use of a novel agent in patients who had failed 
sorafenib. None of the trials assessing novel agents or novel 
combinations of agents in the fi
 rst-line setting met the primary 
endpoint to show improved overall survival over sorafenib. 
Similarly, none of the drugs assessed in the second-line setting 
in patients previously treated with sorafenib who stopped 
because of disease progression or intolerance showed 
improvement over placebo. Therefore, new eff
 ective systemic 
therapies for patients with advanced HCC who fail sorafenib 
treatment are needed.
Added value of this study
Until now, no systemic agent has been shown to improve 
survival over placebo in patients with advanced HCC who fail 
sorafenib treatment. The results of RESORCE show that 
treatment with regorafenib resulted in a signifi
 cant 
improvement in overall survival compared with placebo in 
patients with disease progression on sorafenib. Signifi
 cant 
improvement over placebo was also shown for the secondary 
endpoints of progression-free survival, time to progression, 
disease control, and overall tumour response.
Implications of all the available evidence
This phase 3 trial of regorafenib is the fi
 rst to show an overall 
survival benefi
 t compared with placebo in patients who failed 
sorafenib treatment. Future trials should explore combinations 
of regorafenib with other systemic agents and third-line 
treatments for patients who fail or who do not tolerate the 
sequence of sorafenib and regorafenib.

assignment. The randomisation number for each patient 
was assigned based on information obtained from the 
interactive voice-response system. Tablets with identical 
appearance were used for regorafenib and placebo.
Procedures
Patients received 160 mg regorafenib (four 40 mg tablets) 
orally or matching placebo once daily for the fi
 rst 3 weeks 
of each 4-week cycle. All patients received best supportive 
care. 
Other 
investigational 
antitumour 
drugs, 
antineoplastic chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or 
immunotherapy were not allowed. Treatment continued 
until disease progression as defi
 ned by mRECIST, 
clinical progression (defi
 ned as an ECOG performance 
score ≥3 or symptomatic deterioration, including 
increased liver function tests), death, unacceptable 
toxicity, withdrawal of consent by the patient, or decision 
by the treating physician that discontinuation would be 
in the patient’s best interest. Patients were followed up 
for tumour assessments every 6 weeks for the fi
 rst eight 
cycles and every 12 weeks thereafter during treatment. 
Treatment could be continued beyond progression if the 
investigator judged that the patient would benefi
 t from 
continued treatment. Patients assigned to placebo could 
receive regorafenib after the primary analysis.
Treatment interruptions and dose reductions (to 
120 mg, then 80 mg) were allowed to manage toxicity 
(appendix pp 12–15). The regorafenib dose could be re-
escalated to a maximum of 160 mg at the investigator’s 
discretion once toxicities were resolved. If further dose 
reduction was required, treatment was discontinued.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was overall survival (time from 
randomisation to death due to any cause), analysed by 
intention to treat (ITT). Secondary effi
  cacy endpoints were 
progression-free survival (randomisation to radiological or 
clinical disease progression or death; by ITT), time to 
progression (randomisation to radiological or clinical 
disease progression; by ITT), objective response rate 
(patients with complete or partial response), and disease 
control rate (patients with complete response, partial 
response, or stable disease maintained for ≥6 weeks), 
assessed by investigators using mRECIST22 and RECIST 1.1 
(appendix p 7).
Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was a 
teritiary outcome assessed using the Functional 
Assessment 
of 
Cancer 
Therapy 
(FACT)–General 
(FACT-G), FACT–Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep), EQ-5D, 
and EQ-VAS questionnaires.24,25 The following tertiary 
endpoints are not reported here: pharmacokinetics of 
regorafenib, and biomarker evaluation. Safety was 
assessed by adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, 
vital 
signs, 
and 
electrocardiography. 
Safety 
was 
monitored continuously throughout the study, and 
patients underwent safety evaluations at every cycle. 
Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin were 
assessed weekly during the fi
 rst two cycles. Adverse 
events were graded using National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(NCI-CTCAE) version 4.03 (appendix p 7 for further 
assessments) and seriousness of adverse events was 
recorded. Investigators were blinded to study treatment 
for assessment of whether a death was considered 
related to study drug.
Statistical analysis
Using a per-protocol one-sided α of 0·025, a 
2:1 randomisation between regorafenib and placebo, and 
assuming a median overall survival of 8 months in the 
placebo group, the study would have 90% power to detect 
a 43% increase in overall survival with regorafenib 
(assumed median survival 11·4 months) compared with 
placebo at 370 deaths and requiring 560 patients. For the 
primary effi
  cacy endpoint of overall survival, the groups 
were compared using a log-rank test, stratifi
 ed by the

aforementioned randomisation factors. The hazard ratio 
(HR) for overall survival and its 95% CI were calculated 
using the stratifi
 ed Cox model. An interim futility 
analysis was done after 30% of the events had occurred; 
futility boundaries were not crossed. For analyses of time 
to progression and progression-free survival, groups 
were compared using a log-rank test stratifi
 ed by the 
factors used in the analyses of the primary endpoint. The 
response rates and disease control rates in the two groups 
were compared using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel 
test, with adjustment for the stratifi
 cation factors.
For HRQoL assessments, an analysis-of-covariance 
model was used to compare the time-adjusted area under 
the curve (AUC) between groups with covariates for 
baseline scores and stratifi
 cation factors. The least-squares 
mean (LSM) with 95% CI was estimated for each 
treatment group and for the diff
 erence between groups.
Data were analysed with SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute 
Inc, Cary, NC, USA). The primary analysis was by 
intention to treat; safety analyses included all patients 
who received at least one dose of study drug. The study 
was overseen by a data safety monitoring committee.
This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT01774344.

Results
Between May 14, 2013, and Dec 31, 2015, 843 patients 
were screened, of whom 573 were enrolled and 
randomised (379 to regorafenib and 194 to placebo; 
population for effi
  cacy analyses; fi
 gure 1). 216 patients 
(38%) were from Asia. Overall, 567 patients (99%) started 
treatment (374 in the regorafenib group and 193 in the 
placebo group) and comprise the safety analysis 
population. Treatment groups were similar with respect 
to baseline demographics, tumour burden, ECOG 
performance status, aetiology, and severity of liver disease 
(table 1). We also assessed the pattern of progression 
during sorafenib treatment because this parameter has 
been shown to infl
 uence outcomes and could distort the 
results of second-line studies.26 A potential imbalance in 
the pattern of progression on previous sorafenib was 
ruled out because the distribution of the diff
 erent 
categories was similar across the treatment groups. 
Specifi
 cally, the development of new extrahepatic sites 
during previous sorafenib, which was recently shown to 
be associated with a worse prognosis,26 was present in 
153 (40%) patients in the regorafenib group and 80 (41%) 
in the placebo group. Similarly, growth of existing lesions 
(intrahepatic or extrahepatic; 307 [81%] patients in the 
regorafenib group and 156 [80%] patients in the placebo 
group) or new intrahepatic sites (168 [44%] patients in the 
regorafenib group and 88 [45%] patients in the placebo 
group) were balanced between treatment groups.
Median 
time 
on 
sorafenib 
was 
7·8 
months 
(IQR 4·2–14·5) in the regorafenib group and 7·8 months 
(4·4–14·7) in the placebo group. Median time from 
progression on sorafenib was similar in both groups 
(1·4 months [IQR 0·9–2·3] in the regorafenib group 
vs 1·4 months [0·9–2·2] in the placebo group), as was the 
median time from discontinuation of sorafenib to the 
start of study treatment (0·9 months [IQR 0·7–1·3] in 
both groups).
Of patients who started treatment, 309 (83%) receiving 
regorafenib and 183 (95%) receiving placebo discontinued 
study treatment (fi
 gure 1). The most common reason for 
discontinuation was disease progression (226 [60%] in 
the regorafenib group and 162 [84%] in the placebo 
group). Median treatment duration was 3·6 months 
(IQR 1·6–7·6) with regorafenib and 1·9 months 
(1·4–3·9) with placebo; mean durations were 5·9 months 
(SD 6·0) and 3·3 months (3·9), respectively. Mean daily 
dose of regorafenib was 144·1 mg (SD 21·3) and of 
placebo was 157·4 mg (10·3). Excluding treatment delays 
or interruptions, almost half of the regorafenib group 
(184 [49%] of 374]) received the full protocol dose 
(160 mg/day) with no reductions.

 nal analysis (Feb 29, 2016) and

373 (65%) of the 573 randomised patients had died 
(233 [61%] of 379 in the regorafenib group and 140 [72%] of 
194 in the placebo group). Median overall survival was 
10·6 months (95% CI 9·1–12·1) with regorafenib and 
7·8 months (6·3–8·8) with placebo (HR 0·63 [95% CI 
0·50–0·79]; one-sided p<0·0001; fi
 gure 2A). The 
improvement in overall survival with regorafenib was 
maintained in all preplanned subgroup analyses 
(fi
 gure 3A; appendix p 16).
Median progression-free survival by mRECIST was 
3·1 months (95% CI 2·8–4·2) with regorafenib and 
1·5 months (1·4–1·6) with placebo (fi
 gure 2B). Median 
time to progression by mRECIST was 3·2 months 
(95% CI 2·9–4·2) with regorafenib and 1·5 months 
(1·4–1·6) with placebo (fi
 gure 2C). Predefi
 ned subgroup 
analysis for progression-free survival and time to 
progression 
also 
showed 
a 
consistent 
benefi
 t 
(fi
 gures 3B,C). The HRs for progression-free survival and 
time to progression assessed by RECIST 1.1 were 
comparable (appendix pp 8–11).
Two patients (1% [95% CI <1–2]) in the regorafenib 
group versus no patients in the placebo group had a 
complete response and 38 patients (10% [7–14]) in the 
regorafenib group versus eight patients (4% [2–8]) in the 
placebo group had a partial response by mRECIST as 
assessed by investigators (table 2). 40 (11%) of 379 patients 
in the regorafenib group versus eight (4%) of 194 patients 
in the placebo group achieved an objective response 
(p=0·0047). 247 (65%) of 379 patients in the regorafenib 
group versus 70 (36%) of 194 patients in the placebo 
group achieved disease control (p<0·0001). A signifi
 cant 
improvement in tumour response and disease control 
was also shown using RECIST 1.1 (appendix p 16). 
Tumour shrinkage (any decrease in the sum of diameters 
of target lesions) was reported in 49% (184/379) of 
patients in the regorafenib group and 23% (44/194) of 
patients in the placebo group (appendix p 17). Duration 
of response and duration of stable disease are reported in 
the appendix (p 17). 
All (374/374) patients who received regorafenib and 
179 (93%) of 193 patients who received placebo had at least 
one treatment-emergent adverse event; these were deemed 
possibly study-drug related in 346 (93%) patients who 
received regorafenib and 100 (52%) patients who received 
placebo (table 3). The most common clinically relevant 
grade 3 or 4 events were hypertension (57 patients [15%] in

the regorafenib group vs nine patients [5%] in the placebo 
group), hand–foot skin reaction (47 patients [13%] vs 
one [1%]), fatigue (34 patients [9%] vs nine patients [5%]), 
and diarrhoea (12 patients [3%] vs no patients). The 
frequency of hepatobiliary disorders was higher with 
placebo (18% [34/193]) than with regorafenib (11% 
[40/374]). Serious adverse events occurred in 166 (44%) 
patients assigned to regorafenib and 90 (47%) patients 
assigned to placebo and were attributed to study drug in 
39 (10%) patients assigned to regorafenib and fi
 ve (3%) 
patients assigned to placebo. Of the 88 deaths (grade 5 
adverse events) reported during the study (50 patients 
[13%] assigned to regorafenib and 38 [20%] assigned to 
placebo), seven (2%) were considered by the investigator to 
be related to study drug in the regorafenib arm and two 
(1%) in the placebo arm, including two patients (1%) with 
hepatic failure in the placebo group (appendix p 18). 
21 (6%) of 374 patients in the regorafenib group had 
grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent bleeding events 
versus 15 (8%) of 193 patients in the placebo group 
(appendix p 18). 255 (68%) of 374 patients in the regorafenib 
group had interruptions or dose reductions due to adverse 
events versus 60 (31%) of 193 patients in the placebo group. 
Similarly, 93 (25%) of 374 patients in the regorafenib group 
discontinued due to adverse events versus 37 (19%) of 
193 patients in the placebo group. Drug-related adverse 
events led to interruptions or dose reductions in 202 (54%) 
patients in the regorafenib group and 20 (10%) patients in 
the placebo group, and to discontinuations in 39 (10%) 
patients in the regorafenib group and seven (4%) patients 
in the placebo group. The most common adverse events 
leading 
to 
discontinuation 
more 
frequently 
with 
regorafenib were increase in AST concentration (eight [2%] 
of 374 patients in the regorafenib group vs three [2%] of 
193 patients in the placebo group), hand–foot skin reaction 
(seven [2%] vs none), and ALT increase (four [1%] vs none).
No clinically meaningful diff
 erences were noted 
between the regorafenib and placebo groups in HRQoL. 
Overall changes from baseline in EQ-5D and FACT-Hep 
were similar in the two groups. In the LSM time-adjusted 
AUC analysis of the EQ-5D and FACT-Hep, the scores 
were lower in the regorafenib group than in the placebo 
group, and specifi
 cally the scores of the FACT-Hep Total 
and Trial Outcome Index (a subscale of the FACT-Hep) 
were statistically lower in the regorafenib group than in 
the placebo group (p=0·0006 and p<0·0001, respectively); 
however, minimally important thresholds for the 
diff
 erences as established in the literature were not met 
(appendix p 19).24,25
Discussion
Our study shows that regorafenib provides a signifi
 cant 
and clinically meaningful improvement in overall 
survival in patients with HCC progressing during 
sorafenib treatment. This fi
 nding was associated with an 
increase in median survival from 7·8 months to 
10·6 months. This survival benefi
 t was maintained in the 
prespecifi
 ed subgroup analyses, including geographical 
region and aetiology, and was accompanied by signifi
 cant 
improvements in progression-free survival, time to 
progression, and objective response, and disease control 
rate. Two patients treated with regorafenib had a 
complete tumour response by mRECIST, which excludes 
necrosis of the target lesion from the tumour 
measurement. These responses would also have been 
classifi
 ed as complete using conventional European 
Association for the Study of the Liver criteria.27 
Interestingly, 
we 
noted 
similar 
outcomes 
using 
mRECIST and RECIST 1.1 for progression-free survival 
and time to progression.
The survival of the placebo group in our study is 
consistent with previous second-line studies in HCC at 
about 8 months.11–14 Use of fi
 ve stratifi
 cation factors 
ensured that the trial groups were fully balanced for 
commonly assessed patient and disease characteristics; 
however, we also analysed the distribution of patients 
across treatment groups according to the pattern of 
progression under sorafenib. Pattern of progression has 
recently been found to be a major factor aff
 ecting 
outcome and potentially confounding study results if not 
balanced 
across 
study 
groups.26 
Although 
new 
intrahepatic sites or growth of known tumour lesions 
have been shown to have a moderate eff
 ect on post-
progression survival, the development of new vascular 
invasion or extrahepatic spread is a signifi
 cant predictor 
of a worse survival.26 Pattern of progression under 
previous sorafenib was balanced in this study.
All primary and secondary effi
  cacy outcomes in this 
sorafenib pretreated population seem numerically better 
than those with sorafenib in the fi
 rst-line setting.4,5 This 
might be because regorafenib is more pharmacologically

active than is sorafenib,15 and could also be because 
tolerability to regorafenib was improved for patients 
tolerant to sorafenib due to the somewhat overlapping 
adverse-event profi
 les of the two drugs. As multikinase 
inhibitors, the antitumour activity of regorafenib and 
sorafenib could extend beyond their antiangiogenic 
properties to a direct eff
 ect on tumour and stromal cells 
that modulate infl
 ammatory and immune processes.28 
Recent phase 3 trials in HCC assessing multikinase 
inhibitors having profi
 les that partly overlap with 
regorafenib have failed to improve outcomes over 
sorafenib or versus placebo after sorafenib.6–8,11 The 
results of this study suggest that the sequential use of 
two multikinase inhibitors with partly overlapping target 
profi
 les provides a survival benefi
 t in HCC. Regorafenib 
has been shown to improve survival in patients with 
gastrointestinal stromal tumours after failure of 
two multikinase inhibitors (imatinib and sunitinib).19
This study was designed to assess a new systemic 
treatment for patients with HCC progressing on fi
 rst-
line therapy and incorporated lessons from previous 
phase 3 trials that failed to meet their primary endpoint.6–14 
Only patients with Child-Pugh A liver function were 
included to avoid the potential confounding eff
 ect of 
impaired liver function on survival. To ensure that 
treatment groups were balanced with respect to relevant 
prognostic factors, randomisation was stratifi
 ed by 
α-fetoprotein concentrations and ECOG performance 
status. 
However, 
unlike 
in 
previous 
studies,4,11 
macrovascular invasion and extrahepatic disease were 
separate stratifi
 cation factors. We also stratifi
 ed for 
geographical region because of diff
 erences in access to 
cancer care and the use of locoregional therapies. 
Although the trial was not stratifi
 ed for aetiology, 
geographical region accounts partly for the aetiology of 
HCC because hepatitis B virus infection is the

predominant underlying cause of HCC in most Asian 
countries.
The safety of regorafenib in HCC in this study is 
consistent with the safety profi
 le of regorafenib in other 
gastrointestinal malignancies, and with no new safety 
concerns.18,19 The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse 
events included hypertension, hand–foot skin reaction, 
fatigue, and diarrhoea. Exclusion of patients who were 
unable to tolerate sorafenib could have reduced the 
occurrence of severe adverse events; 10% of patients 
discontinued treatment due to a regorafenib-related 
adverse event. Although underlying liver dysfunction is 
expected to be more common in patients with HCC, the 
rates of liver-related adverse events and liver failure in the 
regorafenib group were not higher in this study compared 
with in other regorafenib trials.18,19 In this study, the only 
two cases of drug-related death due to liver failure 
occurred in the placebo group. Although adverse events 
in the regorafenib group led to higher rates of treatment 
interruptions and dose reductions than did those in the 
placebo group, the median treatment duration was longer 
with regorafenib than with placebo. Assessments using 
standard, validated measures of quality of life in patients 
with hepatobiliary cancer showed no clinically meaningful 
diff
 erences between the groups.
Although biomarker-based treatment decisions have 
become standard of care in certain tumour types, no 
baseline markers predictive of treatment benefi
 t have been 
identifi
 ed for patients with HCC.29,30 Exploratory studies 
have suggested that there is an association between certain 
adverse events, most notably hand–foot skin reaction, and 
overall survival and time to progression.31 However, 
because this approach is based on post-randomisation 
events, it does not inform the selection of patients who 
could derive a greater treatment benefi
 t.
A potential limitation of the study is that it was 
undertaken in patients who progressed during previous 
sorafenib treatment, and therefore fi
 rm conclusions 
about the effi
  cacy of regorafenib in patients who do not 
tolerate  sorafenib cannot be drawn. In addition, special 
populations, such as patients co-infected with HIV, are 
not included here.
The results of this study represent a signifi
 cant advance 
in addressing an unmet need in the treatment of HCC. All 
previous second-line trials of novel agents have failed;11–14 
thus no eff
 ective systemic therapies after progression on 
sorafenib are currently available. These data underscore 
that prolonging exposure to multikinase inhibitors such as 
the sequence of sorafenib and regorafenib in conjunction 
with proper management of adverse events can lead to an 
extension in survival. In conclusion, this study met its 
primary endpoint showing that regorafenib improves 
overall survival in patients with HCC who had disease 
progression during fi
 rst-line treatment with sorafenib.
