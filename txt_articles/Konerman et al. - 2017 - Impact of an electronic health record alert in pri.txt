Despite effective treatment for chronic hepatitis C, deficiencies in diagnosis and access to care preclude disease elimina-
tion. Screening of baby boomers remains low. The aims of this study were to assess the impact of an electronic health
record–based prompt on hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening rates in baby boomers in primary care and access to specialty
care and treatment among those newly diagnosed. We implemented an electronic health record–based “best practice
advisory” (BPA) that prompted primary care providers to perform HCV screening for patients seen in primary care clinic
(1) born between 1945 and 1965, (2) who lacked a prior diagnosis of HCV infection, and (3) who lacked prior docu-
mented anti-HCV testing. The BPA had associated educational materials, order set, and streamlined access to specialty
care for newly diagnosed patients. Pre-BPA and post-BPA screening rates were compared, and care of newly diagnosed
patients was analyzed. In the 3 years prior to BPA implementation, 52,660 baby boomers were seen in primary care clinics
and 28% were screened. HCV screening increased from 7.6% for patients with a primary care provider visit in the 6
months prior to BPA to 72% over the 1 year post-BPA. Of 53 newly diagnosed patients, all were referred for specialty
care, 11 had advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, 20 started treatment, and 9 achieved sustained virologic response thus far. Con-
clusion: Implementation of an electronic health record–based prompt increased HCV screening rates among baby boomers
in primary care by 5-fold due to efficiency in determining needs for HCV screening and workflow design. Streamlined
access to specialty care enabled patients with previously undiagnosed advanced disease to be cured. This intervention can
be easily integrated into electronic health record systems to increase HCV diagnosis and linkage to care. (HEPATOLOGY

O
ver the last few years there have been revolu-
tionary advances in the treatment of chronic
hepatitis C (CHC). Current treatments with
direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) are highly effica-
cious with sustained virologic response (SVR) rates of
>95% for the vast majority of patients.(1,2) Moreover,
unlike interferon-based therapies, DAAs are adminis-
tered orally, have minimal side effects, and are of short
duration. Thus, almost all CHC patients are candi-
dates for treatment. Despite the dramatic advances in
therapy, there remain significant barriers to hepatitis C
virus (HCV) elimination, primary of which are defi-
ciencies in screening and diagnosis of patients with
CHC and subsequent linkage to care.(3) It has been
estimated that only 50%-65% of the estimated 3.2 mil-
lion persons chronically infected with HCV in the
United States are aware of their infection.(4-6) Given
that risk-based screening had not adequately addressed
this deficiency, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the US Preventive Services Task Force

 recommended one-time screening for all baby boomers
(adults born between 1945 and 1965) regardless of the
presence of any of the traditional risk factors for HCV
because this cohort has a 5-fold higher prevalence of
HCV than persons in other age groups.(7,8)
Despite
this
evidence-based
recommendation,
uptake of one-time universal HCV screening among
baby boomers remains low. The reported ranges for
screening among this cohort vary but in general are
estimated to be <30%, even after implementing inter-
ventions specifically aimed at increasing HCV screen-
ing among baby boomers.(9-12) Various approaches
have been evaluated to optimize screening rates includ-
ing integration of HCV screening into other preven-
tive health screening like colonoscopy or human
immunodeficiency virus testing, as well as screening in
emergency room and inpatient settings.(13-16) In order
for HCV screening to have the highest impact, how-
ever, screening needs to be linked with subsequent care
after test results are available. Prior estimates from out-
patient and emergency room settings have shown that
30%-50% of persons who test positive for HCV anti-
body (anti-HCV) never receive confirmatory HCV
RNA testing, and among those with a confirmed diag-
nosis of HCV infection, only a minority (approxi-
mately 35%) are connected with specialty care.(17-19)
As such, conducting HCV screening through an estab-
lished primary care provider (PCP) has been hypothe-
sized to have a higher likelihood of minimizing gaps in
follow-up. These interventions need to be cognizant of
minimizing workload and stretching the already over-
burdened PCPs.
Given the almost universal use of electronic health
record (EHR) systems, there has been much interest in
methods to incorporate automatic prompts into EHRs
as these represent a potentially efficient and effective
approach to incorporate HCV screening within the
context of a busy PCP clinic visit.(20) Integrating
downstream
workflow
to
optimize
referral
and
ultimately access to DAA therapy would further
increase the overall impact of an HCV screening pro-
gram and address critical deficiencies in the HCV “care
cascade” where only 7.4% of diagnosed patients are
estimated to have been started on HCV treatment
globally.(21) We developed a best practice advisory
(BPA) in our EHR to prompt HCV screening among
baby boomers and designed a detailed workflow for
subsequent care management for newly diagnosed
patients. The primary aim of this study was to assess
the impact of our EHR-based prompt on HCV
screening rates in baby boomers seen in primary care
clinics. Secondary aims included evaluation of the
impact on access to specialty care and curative treat-
ment among patients newly diagnosed with CHC.
Patients and Methods
ASSESSMENT OF PRE-BPA AND
POST-BPA SCREENING RATES
In order to compare HCV screening rates and
patient/provider characteristics associated with screen-
ing patterns, we evaluated all adult patients within the
baby boomer cohort who had at least one visit during
the prior 3 years in primary care clinics in our health
system, which has clinics in 13 locations within a 30-
mile radius from our main campus in Ann Arbor. All
providers are employed by the University of Michigan,
and all clinics use the same EHR system. Primary care
clinics encompass four different medicine specialties:
general internal medicine, family medicine, medicine/
pediatrics, and geriatrics. We assessed rates of both
anti-HCV orders and anti-HCV tests performed to
capture
potential
discrepancies
between
screening
orders and screening tests completed. We additionally
assessed rates of anti-HCV positivity and downstream
confirmatory HCV RNA testing and results. To
examine the association between patient and provider

 characteristics and screening patterns, we collected
data on patient age, gender, race/ethnicity, and insur-
ance provider, as well as clinic sites and provider spe-
cialties. The baseline screening period consisted of the
3 years prior to implementation of the BPA. The post-
BPA screening period consisted of 1-year post–system
wide implementation of the BPA. We assessed screen-
ing rates both by number of screening-eligible PCP
visits and by screening-eligible patients (as patients
had varying numbers of PCP clinic visits over the study
periods of interest). This study was approved by the
University of Michigan institutional review board.
DESIGN OF THE BPA: PCP CLINIC
VISIT
A BPA alert was developed in conjunction with our
EHR Population and Health Management Ambula-
tory Care Services Team and consultation from several
PCPs with the primary aim of increasing uptake of
one-time HCV screening for baby boomers. As part of
this initiative, patient educational flyers regarding the
rationale for HCV screening in baby boomers were
posted in primary care clinics and educational materials
were also provided in the electronic patient portal to
raise awareness and prime patients for potential
discussion about HCV screening during their visit.
The BPA would “fire” for any patient seen in primary
care clinic who (1) was born between 1945 and 1965;
(2) lacked a prior EHR International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth or Tenth Revision, diagnosis code of
HCV infection; and (3) lacked documented anti-HCV
testing after 2009 in our EHR. A detailed illustration
of the BPA workflow is provided in Fig. 1. To briefly
review, upon rooming a patient for the appointment,
the medical assistant (MA) would inform the patient
about age-based HCV screening and inquire if the
patient had been screened elsewhere or prior to 2009
(which would not be captured in our EHR and thus
the BPA would still fire if HCV screening was done
externally or prior to 2009). If the patient had anti-
HCV testing performed prior to 2009 or elsewhere,
the MA would override the BPA. If testing had not
been performed prior, then the MA would provide
patient educational materials on the rationale for HCV
screening, what the screening consisted of, and inter-
pretation of test results. During the clinic visit, the
PCP would then discuss HCV screening with the
patient and indicate if the patient agreed with or
declined testing. If “patient declines” was chosen as the
reason to not pursue testing, the BPA would fire again
at the patient’s next visit after 10 months for all

 patients to allow PCPs to rediscuss HCV testing.
Because some patients are seen at frequent intervals,
the BPA did not fire at each subsequent visit. If the
patient accepted screening, then a prepopulated “smart
set” with anti-HCV lab order and associated diagnosis
code would be signed. An illustration of the BPA
interface is provided in Fig. 2. Of note, this BPA was
not designed as a “hard stop” in that the PCP could
acknowledge the BPA but was not required to either
document a reason for not testing or order testing in
order for the PCP to be able to continue to work in
the patient’s encounter. This decision was made given
that “hard stop” BPAs were in general poorly received
by providers.
DEVELOPMENT OF THE BPA:
FOLLOW-UP ON ANTI-HCV TEST
RESULTS
At the time of implementation of the BPA, our
pathology lab did not have reflex testing in place for
HCV RNA for samples that had a reactive anti-HCV
result due to concerns about potential contamination
of previously used samples. Thus, patients with anti-
HCV–positive results were asked to return for HCV
RNA testing. We developed result scripts to facilitate
nurses’ follow-up with patients based on the result of
their anti-HCV and HCV RNA tests. Follow-up
workflow based on testing results is displayed in Fig. 1.
In addition, we provided guidelines on HCV consulta-
tions including recommended testing prior to referral.
DESIGN OF THE BPA: PILOT
TESTING
The BPA was initially pilot-tested at three clinic
sites (one general medicine, one family medicine, and
one medicine/pediatrics) over a 3-month period to
ensure streamlined workflow and to identify potential
areas for improvement in implementation of the BPA.
Feedback was solicited from patients, PCPs, registered
nurses, and MAs with regard to design and workflow.
During the 3-month pilot phase, we identified the
optimal timing for provision of educational materials
for HCV screening to the patient. Initially these mate-
rials were also made available prior to the appointment
for eligible patients through the EHR patient portal,
but this caused anxiety among a small number of
patients; thus, it was removed and provided during the
clinic visit to allow PCPs to address questions/con-
cerns in real time. During this pilot phase we also
worked with our pathology department to improve the
associated text that accompanied anti-HCV and HCV
RNA test reports to simplify interpretation of results
by both patients and providers. We additionally
engaged in conversation about the possibility of reflex
testing for HCV RNA among patients with anti-
HCV–positive results. Lastly, we were able to assess
logistics and demand for referral to specialty care. The
BPA was then implemented across all primary care
clinics.
HCV CARE CASCADE
In order to assess the downstream impact of our
BPA, we followed the subsequent care cascade for all
patients with a detectable HCV RNA. We assessed
the number of patients referred to a hepatology clinic,
number of patients seen, number of patients prescribed
DAA therapy, number of patients started on DAA,
and number of patients who achieved SVR (assessed at
week 12 after completion of therapy). We also assessed
stage of liver disease for the patients seen in a hepatol-
ogy clinic.
HCV TESTING
Anti-HCV and HCV RNA tests were performed at
the Clinical Pathology Laboratories at our main hospi-
tal for patients seen at all clinical sites. Anti-HCV was
tested using a chemiluminescent immunoassay, Sie-
mens ADVIA Centaur Immunoassay (Malvern, PA).
A signal to cutoff ratio of 1-10.99 was categorized as
weakly reactive and �11 was categorized as reactive.
HCV RNA was tested using the Abbott RealTime
HCV Test (Abbott Park, IL) with a lower limit of
detection of 12 IU/mL.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Descriptive and bivariate analyses were performed to
assess trends in testing and characteristics associated

SCREENING RATES AND
CHARACTERISTICS IN PRE-BPA
AND POST-BPA PERIODS
In the 3-year pre-BPA period, a total of 52,660
patients in the baby boomer cohort had a PCP visit.
HCV screening was ordered in only 28% of patients
over this 3-year period. HCV screening was more
often performed in male patients (31% versus 26%),
among African American and Asian patients (34% and
36% versus 27%-29%), and among patients with Med-
icaid or Medicare (34% and 32% versus 26%-28%).
Screening rates also varied substantially across clinic
sites and clinic specialties, as demonstrated in Table 1.
The increase in screening rates and the associated
patient and provider characteristics over the course of
the post-BPA period are demonstrated in Table 1.
Over the 1-year post-BPA period, screening rates
increased evenly across patient and provider character-
istics, although screening rates within the single geriat-
rics clinic remained comparatively lower than those in
other clinics.
Regarding use of the BPA, “patient declines” was
documented as a reason to not pursue screening only
4% of the time. Similarly, medical comorbidities and
prior testing elsewhere were infrequently documented
as a reason why HCV screening was not pursued (1%
each). There was no reason documented why HCV
screening was not performed or the lab order not
signed in the remaining cases. Review of baby boomer
PCP clinic visits over the study period demonstrated
that approximately 31% of baby boomers seen in pri-
mary care clinics did not have the BPA fire due to prior
HCV screening or preexisting diagnosis of CHC.
DIAGNOSTIC TESTING RESULTS
IN PRE-BPA AND POST-BPA
PERIODS
We compared HCV screening and diagnostic test
results in a similar number of eligible clinic visits and
eligible patients in the pre-BPA and post-BPA period
(Table 2). In the 6-month pre-BPA period, anti-HCV
was ordered in only 4.6% of eligible visits and 7.6% of
eligible patients compared to 47% and 72% in the 12-

 month post-BPA period (P < 0.001). When ordered,
an anti-HCV test was performed in 99% of patients in
both the pre-BPA and post-BPA period. The rate of a
positive anti-HCV result was low in both the pre-BPA
and post-BPA periods (2% and 0.8%, respectively).
The frequency with which a confirmatory HCV RNA
test was ordered was higher in the post-BPA period,
though the difference was not statistically significant
(86% versus 94%, P 5 0.09). It should be noted that
reflex HCV RNA testing was implemented in June
2016 (approximately the midpoint of our 1-year BPA
implementation).
The percentage of anti-HCV–positive patients with
a detectable HCV RNA was lower in the post-BPA
period (74% versus 33%, P < 0.001). Prior to imple-
mentation of reflex HCV RNA testing, anti-HCV
results were reported as reactive or weakly reactive
based on the signal to cutoff ratio, whereas after reflex
testing was implemented, anti-HCV results were
reported only as reactive or nonreactive without further
qualification (i.e., reactive versus weakly reactive).
Eighty-three patients with a positive anti-HCV but
undetectable HCV RNA had testing done prior to
implementation of reflex HCV RNA testing. Of these,
69 (83%) were only weakly reactive on anti-HCV test.
Among patients with a positive anti-HCV, those with
undetectable HCV RNA were less likely to be African
American (72% versus 85%, P 5 0.04) but had similar
age distributions (age 50-59 45% versus 34%, age 60-
70 55% versus 66%; P 5 0.16) compared to those with
detectable HCV RNA.
HCV CARE CASCADE
Among the 56 patients with an initial detectable
HCV RNA in the post-BPA period, 3 had low HCV
RNA levels (<12 IU/mL) that were not confirmed on
subsequent testing. All 53 patients with confirmed
CHC were referred to specialty care. At the time of
data analysis, a total of 46 had attended their specialty
clinic appointment, 1 had an upcoming appointment,
2 declined referral, and 4 were no longer seen at our
center. Among these 53 patients, 6 had cirrhosis by
imaging or transient elastography, 3 had advanced
fibrosis, and 21 had no or mild fibrosis (F0-F2) by
transient elastography. Of the remaining 23 patients, 2
had aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index
>1.5. Thus, in total, 11 of 53 (20.7%) patients with
CHC had advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.
At the time of writing, DAA therapy was prescribed
in 31 patients, of whom 20 had started treatment. For
the 11 prescribed DAA but not started on treatment, 6
were still pending approval of their DAA prescription,
4 were denied access to treatment by their insurance
provider, and 1 was managed at an outside facility and
thus treatment status was unknown. Of the 20 patients
who started therapy, 9 had completed treatment and
achieved SVR 12 and 11 had SVR labs upcoming,
with 9 having end of treatment response (the remain-
ing 2 patients were still on therapy) (Fig. 3). Of the 15
patients not yet prescribed DAA treatment, 7 required
additional follow-up assessment, 4 required manage-
ment of severe active alcohol or substance abuse, 2 had
active malignancies (one nonhepatic and one newly
diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma), 1 did not return
for follow-up, and 1 was managed by another specialist
outside our system.
Discussion
Despite revolutionary advances in treatment for
CHC, HCV infection remains a worldwide public
health problem due to the multiple systematic barriers
to disease eradication. Given the potential morbidity
and mortality resulting from CHC, interventions
aimed at mitigating these deficiencies in the HCV care
cascade are critical. The National Academies of Scien-
ces, Engineering and Medicine recently released a
report regarding a strategy to eliminate CHC with a
goal to reduce new cases of HCV infection by 90%
and mortality from CHC by 65% in the United States
by the year 2030.(6) Key areas within this strategy focus

 on improvements in screening and diagnosis as well as
improvement in access to specialty care and curative
therapies. While various approaches have been evalu-
ated to improve HCV screening across diverse patient
care settings, most programs have resulted in only
modest improvement in screening rates. Moreover,
without linkage to subsequent confirmatory diagnostic
testing and follow-up care, the impact of screening
programs has been significantly muted. Herein we
describe a low-cost, efficient, and highly effective
EHR-based HCV screening program for baby boom-
ers in the primary care setting that resulted in a 5-fold
increase in screening rates with subsequent successful
linkage to specialty care and curative treatment.
The findings of our study echoed those of prior
investigations demonstrating the low rate of uptake of
the universal recommendation for one-time HCV
screening for baby boomers with only 28% of patients
having been screened over the 3-year baseline assess-
ment period. Also of note, the practice patterns at
baseline varied according to gender, race, insurance
type, and clinic type. These discrepant screening rates
have been shown previously and in part reflect per-
ceived varying prevalence rates of HCV infection
among different patient cohorts.(22) Of note, these
practice variations disappeared once the BPA imple-
mentation had been in place for 1 year, with screening
rates being driven by baby boomer status and not by
other demographic, insurance, or practice setting varia-
bles. HCV screening rates among baby boomers
increased 5-fold to 72% during the 1-year period after
implementation of the EHR-based BPA. This HCV
screening rate among baby boomers is one of the high-
est cited in the literature to date. The success of this
screening intervention is a direct result of the ease of
the EHR design, which was constructed based on the
needs of and feedback provided by PCPs. Specifically,
this BPA eliminated the burden of work previously
placed on PCPs to first remember the need for HCV
screening in this population and second to verify prior
HCV testing or diagnosis of individual patients. There
has been concern about “alert fatigue,” particularly on
the part of PCPs who are asked to screen for numerous
conditions within time-constrained visits. Keeping this
concern in mind, we developed the alert with input
from a PCP (H.C.), did a pilot run for 3 months, and
proactively solicited feedback from PCPs. We elected
to not make the alert a “hard stop” for the clinic
encounters and to not have the BPA fire at each subse-
quent visit until it was addressed based on PCP feed-
back and in order to prevent impeding workflow. As
such, this BPA was favorably received by PCPs. Lastly,
we incorporated educational materials for both patients
and the medical staff in order to help decrease anxiety
related to screening, reduce workload for PCP clinics,
and make it easy for staff to provide rationales for
screening and explanation of subsequent results.
In addition to the improvement in HCV screening
were the associated improvements in confirmatory test-
ing and subsequent linkage to care. Post-BPA, 94% of
patients with a positive anti-HCV had a confirmatory
HCV RNA ordered compared to only 86% in the pre-
BPA period, although these differences were not statis-
tically significant and implementation of reflex HCV
RNA testing during the latter part of the study period
may also have contributed to this increase. Our rate of
confirmatory testing compares favorably with estimates
of only 30%-50% in other studies.(17,18) Some studies
showed that reflex HCV RNA testing can improve the
likelihood of confirmatory testing and would certainly
minimize inconvenience to patients and decrease their
anxiety while waiting for additional testing. We are
pleased that with continued dialogue with our pathology
colleagues, we were able to incorporate reflex testing for
HCV RNA in patients who test positive for anti-HCV.
Interestingly, in our cohort the prevalence of positive
anti-HCV was low (2% and 0.8% in pre-BPA and
post-BPA period, respectively). Estimates from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the
baby boomer cohort cite an approximate 3.25% preva-
lence of anti-HCV, though similar studies have found
lower rates when screening programs have been imple-
mented for this population in nonurban primary care
settings.(23-25) Our low anti-HCV positivity rate may
also be reflective of the demographics of our patient
population. In addition, many of our patients have been
in our health system for many years, and an estimated
31% of our baby boomers seen in primary care clinics
did not have the BPA fire due to prior HCV screening
or preexisting diagnosis of CHC. Another interesting
finding was the low rate of detectable HCV RNA in
the post-BPA period, with only 33% of patients with
positive anti-HCV having a detectable HCV RNA.
Reviewing these cases in detail revealed that the major-
ity of the patients who were anti-HCV–positive but had
undetectable HCV RNA had weakly reactive anti-
HCV and thus were likely false positives. Similar find-
ings had been observed in other studies when screening
was conducted in larger numbers of persons with low
risk of infection.(24,26)
Contrary to other studies of birth cohort screening,
we had much higher success rates with follow-up care

 and subsequent DAA treatment. Within 6 months of
the end of the 1-year post-BPA implementation
period, 100% of patients with newly diagnosed CHC
were referred to specialty care, with 87% already seen
by a specialist and 67% of these patients prescribed
DAA therapy. This success in bridging gaps in linkage
to care after initial screening and diagnosis are reflec-
tive of the primary care–based setting for the interven-
tion that is more amenable to facilitating necessary
follow-up. Data examining subsequent linkage to care
and curative treatment from other similar EHR-based
interventions for HCV screening of baby boomers in
primary care are limited. Our rates of visits with HCV
specialists and initiation on DAA therapy were higher
than those of other studies: 77% newly diagnosed
patients seen by specialists in the study by Goel et al.
and 21% and 57% of newly diagnosed patients started
on DAA in the studies by Mera et al. and Miller et al.,
respectively.(11,27,28) While most of the newly diag-
nosed patients had early-stage disease, 20.7% had evi-
dence of either cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis at the
time of initial referral. These patients likely would have
remained undiagnosed until they presented with
decompensated
liver
disease
had
they
not
been
screened as a result of the BPA. With the high rate of
cure in the DAA era, early diagnosis and treatment
would prevent progression of liver disease. Though
preliminary, our study showed that 9 of 9 evaluable
patients achieved SVR 12 and an additional 9 patients
had end of treatment response.
There are several limitations to our study. These
include the relatively homogenous patient population
with potentially lower risk of HCV infection that may
have accounted for the low anti-HCV positivity rate in
this study. Also, while EHR has been adopted widely
for clinical patient care, it may not be present in all set-
tings; and thus, the applicability of this intervention
would be limited to practices with EHR in place. Our
hospital system uses an Epic-based EHR, which is
used by many other health centers in the United States.
The BPA design could easily be implemented in other
Epic-based systems or adapted for other EHRs.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that implementa-
tion of an EHR-based BPA for HCV screening
among baby boomers in the primary care setting
resulted in a 5-fold increase in screening rates and was
well received by PCPs. The associated structured
workflow to address confirmatory testing and referral
to specialty care was critical in minimizing gaps in the
HCV care cascade. As a result of this intervention, we
were able to identify patients with CHC who likely
would not have been diagnosed and treated until they
presented with complications of cirrhosis. This type of
EHR-based intervention represents a low-cost, effi-
cient, and effective means to improve HCV screening,
diagnosis, and access to care, which ultimately can lead
to mitigation of the associated morbidity and mortality
of CHC.
