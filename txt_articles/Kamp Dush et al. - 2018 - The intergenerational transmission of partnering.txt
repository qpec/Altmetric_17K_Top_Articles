Abstract
As divorce and cohabitation dissolution in the US have increased, partnering has expanded
to the point that sociologists describe a merry-go-round of partners in American families.
Could one driver of the increase in the number of partners be an intergenerational transmis-
sion of partnering? We discuss three theoretical perspectives on potential mechanisms that
would underlie an intergenerational transmission of partnering: the transmission of eco-
nomic hardship, the transmission of marriageable characteristics and relationship skills, and
the transmission of relationship commitment. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth 1979 Child and Young Adult study (NLSY79 CYA) and their mothers in the National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), we examined the intergenerational transmis-
sion of partnering, including both marital and cohabitating unions, using prospective mea-
sures of family and economic instability as well as exploiting sibling data to try to identify
potential mechanisms. Even after controlling for maternal demographic characteristics and
socioeconomic factors, the number of maternal partners was positively associated with off-
spring’s number of partners. Hybrid sibling Poisson regression models that examined sibling
differential experiences of maternal partners indicated that there were no differences
between siblings who witnessed more or fewer maternal partners. Overall, results sug-
gested that the transmission of poor marriageable characteristics and relationship skills
from mother to child may warrant additional attention as a potential mechanism through
which the number of partners continues across generations.
Introduction
Stable romantic unions, including marriage and cohabitation, are linked to better mental and
physical health for both adults and children [1]. However, maintaining such unions can be diffi-
cult; half of first cohabiting unions dissolve within three years [2] and half of first marriages dis-
solve within twenty years [3]. After a union dissolves, most individuals repartner [4]. Repartnering
is defined as remarriage or cohabitation after a union dissolution [5]. Unions formed through
repartnering are more likely to end than first unions [6, 7], creating additional opportunities for
more repartnering. Repartnering has grown such that 9% of American children live in households

 with a cohabiting or married stepparent [8], 55% of whom live with a married step-parent and
45% with a cohabiting step-parent [9], and further, 11% live with half or step-siblings [10]. Second
unions may have increased health benefits compared to first [11], and children whose mothers
repartner may grow up in a household with increased economic wellbeing [12]. At the same time,
due to their increased rates of dissolution, repartnered unions can increase family instability with
potentially negative effects for both adults and children [13].
Partnering is operationalized as the number of partners one experiences and includes mul-
tiple processes including initial union formation, divorce or dissolution, and repartnering.
Partnering behaviors may be transmitted across generations. Children of divorce are more
likely to divorce themselves, increasing the opportunity for repartnering [14]. Cohabitation
rates have doubled over the past 25 years [15] and the proportion of children born to cohabit-
ing parents has also grown [16]. A majority of children who experience maternal cohabitation
will also experience its dissolution [17], opening the door to more partners entering their lives.
Little work has examined the intergenerational transmission of partnering including cohabita-
tion dissolution as well as divorce. A recent study by Amato and Patterson [18] found an inter-
generational transmission of partnering using retrospective data but Amato and Peterson were
unable to account for concurrent changes in family economic hardship that could explain this
intergenerational transmission.
Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Child and Young Adult study
(NLSY79 CYA) and mothers in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79),
we examine the intergenerational transmission of partnering, including spouses and cohabitat-
ing partners. Three theoretical perspectives guided our analyses. The economic hardship per-
spective suggests that economic hardships resulting from divorce drives the intergenerational
transmission of partnering. Economic hardship causes more conflict in intimate relationships
[19], rendering the unions of the poor less stable [2] and thus increasing the opportunity for
repartnering. Further, poor single mothers may be more motivated to enter into a new union
to secure additional economic capital for their children [12], although second unions tend to
dissolve quickly [20] and may lead to additional partnering.
The intergenerational transmission of marriageable characteristics and relationship skills
perspective [14, 21] argues that heritable maternal characteristics as well as maternal relation-
ship skills and behaviors undermine union success and increase the likelihood of repartnering.
Manning, Trella [21] have argued that both men and women may not be “marriageable”, that
is, may have characteristics that make them undesirable partners, including depression, sub-
stance use, and poor economic prospects. Some of these characteristics may be passed from
mother to child. For example, mothers who are depressed are more likely to have children
with elevated internalized problems [22]. Maternal personality traits such as the ability to trust
others are also evident in their offspring [23]. Mothers who use substances in adolescence and
early adulthood are more likely to have children who do so [24]. Parents’ relational and con-
flict behavior are associated with their own children’s relational behavior in adolescence and
adulthood [25, 26] Thus, according to this perspective, mothers pass their marriageable char-
acteristics on to their offspring, and these characteristics and behaviors, not the number of
maternal partners itself, drive the intergenerational transmission of partnering. Extending this
argument, siblings who share genes as well as a family environment should report similar levels
of partnering, even if one sibling experienced more maternal partners because they were born
during their mother’s first union compared to a later sibling who experienced fewer partners
because they were born during a later union.
The intergenerational transmission of commitment perspective suggests that witnessing a
repartnering, rather than the economic hardship, maternal characteristics, or family environ-
ment associated with the repartnering, leads offspring to have less stable unions [14] and thus

 a higher number of partners. This perspective proposes that witnessing commitments being
broken teaches children that unions do not need to last a lifetime, and that new unions can be
formed that may better meet an individual’s needs. Thus a sibling who witnesses the entry of a
new partner should have a significantly higher likelihood of repartnering compared to the sib-
ling who did not. Given that multipartner fertility—having children with new partners after
having had children in past relationships—has led to increased family complexity in the US,
this is not an uncommon situation; 11% of children live in blended families with half- or step-
siblings who do not share the same biological parents [10]. We are able to test the following
competing hypotheses based on these three theoretical perspectives because the NLSY79 CYA
includes all children born to the mothers in the NLSY79.
Theoretical perspectives on the intergenerational transmission of
partnering
Economic hardship perspective.
Both divorce and cohabitation dissolution have negative
financial consequences [27]. Once a mother repartners, economic resources may increase [28],
but poverty rates for economically disadvantaged divorced mothers exceed those of never-
married mothers [29]. The economic hardship perspective argues that the family financial dif-
ficulties experienced by young adults who experienced their mothers’ repartnering is primarily
responsible for the negative outcomes that these young adults experience, namely their own
proclivity to partner multiple times, through four mechanisms. First, the economic conse-
quences of dissolution may have serious implications for young adult development. Individu-
als who were raised in families with fewer economic resources have poorer socioemotional,
cognitive, and behavioral development in childhood [30] and have lower academic achieve-
ment in adulthood [31], which could render these young adults less attractive partners in the
marriage market and once in a union [21].
Secondly, socioeconomic status transmits across generations [31] and the economic stress
that results from economic hardship is one of the most common and significant causes of rela-
tionship conflict [19]. Unsurprisingly, economic stress is associated with an increased odds of
union dissolution [32] and lower odds of moving from cohabitation to marriage [19], opening
the door for more partners if the union dissolves.
Another mechanism may be the young adult’s age at first union formation. Young adult off-
spring who experience their mother dissolving and forming unions leave home and assume
adult roles and responsibilities earlier, including entering unions [33]. In contrast, offspring
with more resources may delay entering a union because they are in college and perceive these
years as a time for self-development [34]. Younger ages at marriage and cohabitation are asso-
ciated with elevated union instability and increased opportunity for partnering [35]. Arnett
[36] has argued that identity development among young adults in developed countries has
been delayed and that young adults now experience a new developmental period called emerg-
ing adulthood. Early unions may also be unstable because they were formed during emerging
adulthood prior to identity development.
Finally, offspring from more advantaged backgrounds often receive resources from their
parents that allow them to delay their entrance into coresidential unions, such as help with col-
lege tuition and residential costs [37, 38]. In contrast, single mothers have fewer resources to
provide [39]. If the mother repartners, she may have difficulty providing resources because
stepparents and remarried biological parents are less likely to approve of support for adult chil-
dren [40], leaving the offspring with fewer resources and a greater incentive to enter union(s)
that may then be rendered more unstable due to economic stress. Indeed, cohabitors often cite
saving money as a motivation for cohabitation [41].

 Hypothesis 1. Based on the economic hardship perspective, we hypothesized that a significant
association between maternal and offspring partnering would either become nonsignificant
or be reduced in magnitude following the addition of maternal employment, education,
and poverty to the model.
Intergenerational transmission of marriageable characteristics and relationship
skills. A second mechanism is the intergenerational transmission of marriageable character-
istics (i.e. an agreeable disposition, greater educational attainment) and relationship skills (i.e.
communication and conflict resolution styles). Family scholars have long argued that some
individuals are more “marriageable” than others; that is, that some individuals possess charac-
teristics that make them attractive potential romantic partners [21]. Through both genetics
and the environment, parents play an important role in shaping offspring’s marriageable char-
acteristics. For example, children of depressed mothers have elevated interpersonal dysfunc-
tion, negative cognitions, and poor emotion regulation that increase their risk of adult
depressive symptoms [42, 43]. Individuals with more depressive symptoms have less stable
unions [44]. Personality traits also heritable, hence maternal personality traits that undermine
union stability may be shared by their offspring [45]. Individuals who are more agreeable,
extraverted, conscientious, and less neurotic tend to be desirable romantic partners [46] and
have more stable unions [47]. If the intergenerational transmission of marriageable character-
istics is driving the intergenerational transmission of partnering behavior, then we would
expect siblings to be similar to one another in their own levels of partnering due to shared
genes and environment, even if they had different experiences with their mothers’ partnering.
Amato and DeBoer [14] argued that there is also an intergenerational transmission of rela-
tionship skills. They suggest that young adults learn relationship skills by watching their
parents interact and through their own interactions with their parents and those that learn
poor skills from their parents are more likely to have unstable relationships [14, 25]. Couples
that divorce have poorer communication styles, less provision or receipt of social support, and
more undermining and destructive conflict [48, 49], all of which may be witnessed, and
learned, by their children. Indeed, young adults who witnessed a parental divorce exhibit
poorer relationship functioning than those whose parents did not divorce [26]. Less research
has been conducted on the relationship functioning predictors of cohabitation dissolution, but
given the high levels of instability among cohabiting unions with children [17], children in
cohabiting families may be more likely than children in married families to witness negative
relationship behaviors that, if learned, could make their own relationships less stable [50, 51].
Hypothesis 2. Based on the intergenerational transmission of marriageable characteristics and
relationship skills perspective, we hypothesized that there would be no sibling differences in
the significant association between maternal and offspring partnering.
The intergenerational transmission of commitment.
The intergenerational transmis-
sion of commitment perspective suggests that witnessing their parents’ partnering contributes
to young adult offspring union instability [14]. Specifically, young adults who observe their
parents breaking a commitment and repartnering learn that committed relationships can be
dissolved and new unions can be formed that may better meet an individual’s needs. Witness-
ing repartnering may thus weaken their commitment to their union particularly if relationship
quality declines [14]. Many unions decline in relationship quality over time [52, 53], thus it
may be inevitable that partners experience some disillusionment. This perspective argues that
young adults who observe their parent in a stable union will be less likely to dissolve any union
themselves, even if their parents had an earlier, unstable union prior to that young adult’s
birth. Those young adults whose parents divorced are more likely to question the stability and

 permanence of their own relationships [14, 54], even when controlling for their own relation-
ship’s quality. Interestingly, the children of divorce generally do not believe that marriage
should be avoided [55], and those that want to avoid marriage do not avoid cohabitation [56].
When comparing the intergenerational transmission of relationship skills and commitment
perspectives as it relates to divorce, Amato and DeBoer [14] found more support for the trans-
mission of commitment perspective. The offspring of parents who dissolved less distressed
marriages were more likely to divorce and offspring who grew up with parents whose relation-
ships were highly distressed but stable were less likely to divorce [14]. A final mechanism of
the transmission of commitment could be through maternal cohabitation. Cohabiting unions
with children are less committed than marriages [57], thus offspring who experience maternal
cohabitation may enter their own unions with less commitment and be more likely to dissolve
their union and then repartner.
Hypothesis 3: Based on the intergenerational transmission of commitment perspective, we
hypothesized that siblings who experienced more maternal partners would report having a
greater number of partners than their siblings who experienced fewer maternal partners.
Previous research related to the intergenerational transmission of partnering.
There is
a robust body of research on the intergenerational transmission of divorce. Young adults who
experience a parental divorce are significantly more likely to divorce themselves [14, 58].
There has been some debate in the literature about whether the intergenerational transmission
of divorce has changed over time, but when the exposure to the risk of divorce is considered,
Li and Wu [59] found no change over time in the intergenerational transmission of divorce. A
recent paper by Amato and Patterson [18] examined retrospective data on maternal union
instability, including cohabitation and marriage, measured when the offspring was an adoles-
cent, and its association with offspring union instability. Amato and Patterson [18] found evi-
dence for an intergenerational transmission of instability even after controlling for several
variables including family income at age 16, maternal education, maternal religiosity, parent-
child closeness, offspring depression and delinquency, offspring educational attainment, and
the number of sex partners. Their results did not support the economic hardship perspective,
but their lack of prospective and concurrent data on economic hardship was an important
limitation.
Selection.
Selection may play a significant role in the intergenerational transmission of
partnering. African-American and Hispanic women are more likely to have births outside of
marriage and cohabitation [60] which sets the stage for new partners to come into the mother
and children’s lives. Most African-American women are single at the time of their nonmarital
birth whereas Hispanic women are more likely to give birth within a cohabiting union [60].
Cohabiting unions with children face an increased likelihood of dissolution [17]. Thus, we
control for maternal family structure at birth, maternal race, as well as the offspring’s own
parental status. Maternal age at child’s birth is also associated with a variety of offspring out-
comes [58] thus we also control for it. Finally, male and female young adult offspring may
respond differently to parental divorce [61] and older young adult offspring will have more
opportunity to exit and enter successive unions. Therefore, gender and age of young adults at
the last recorded interview were also included in each model.
Method
We use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) and the National Longitu-
dinal Survey of Youth 1979 Child and Young Adult (NLSY79 CYA) datasets. The NLSY79 is a
longitudinal sample consisting of 12,686 young men and women ages 14–22 when first

 interviewed in 1979 and was nationally representative in 1979. Data were collected annually
until 1994 and biennially thereafter. The NLSY79 CYA data were collected biennially from all
biological offspring of the women in the NLSY79 beginning in 1986. Through 1992, all data
was mother-reported, but beginning in 1994, offspring who were aged 15 and older completed
a lengthy interview similar to the NLSY79 interview. Because offspring age into the young
adult sample, the sample over-represents offspring born to the youngest mothers. By 2012,
76% of all maternal offspring in the NLSY79 CYA dataset had been interviewed as a young
adult at least once (n = 7999). Of these young adults, we retained those who were at least 18
and for whom we had complete maternal partnership data to that point, n = 7152 (n = 3272
mothers). Of these, 91% had been interviewed at age 20, 60% at age 25, and 24% at age 30. The
average age at first cohabitation for this cohort is 21.8 and 23.5 for women and men respec-
tively [62]. Of this analytic sample of 7152, 87% (n = 6246) of offspring had at least one sibling
in the sample (2366 total sibships).
Variables
Descriptive statistics for the full sample and the sibling sample are reported in Table 1.
Maternal total partners.
The NLSY79 tracked respondent cohabiting partners and
spouses across time. Partnership status was measured at the time of interview by self-reported
marital and cohabitation status, and spouses and live-in partners were denoted in a household
roster. At every wave, dates of up to three marital transitions since the last interview were

 collected, including divorce, marriage, and widowhood, even if a marriage began and ended
between waves. Marriages that started before 1979 were retrospectively reported by date.
Beginning in 1994, mothers reported if they had cohabited with the spouses they were cur-
rently married to, and when they had begun this cohabitation. In addition, unmarried respon-
dents who reported living with a partner defined the beginning date of that union. Starting in
2000, beginning and end dates of cohabiting unions that were at least three months long were
collected, even if the cohabitation started and ended between waves. We created an overall
measure of the total number of maternal partners from these data. Because some relationship
transitions were unclear (i.e. dates were missing, relationships ended and then later continued,
and relationships overlapped), some relationships may have been missed and thus our measure
may be an undercount. For each offspring, we generated a total maternal partner count that
captured the number of partners each offspring had been exposed to since the year of their
birth, including partnerships at the time of the child’s birth. Maternal total partner counts ran-
ged from 0–9 (M = 1.73, SD = 1.24). We also created separate measures of maternal partners
by marital status.
Offspring total partners.
Offspring total partner number was assessed in the NLSY79
CYA for years 1994 to 2012 using several variables. The highest reported value for the item ask-
ing, “How many marriage or partner relationships have you been involved in?” was used for
years 1994 through 1998. Two datum were recoded to missing, as their reported number of
partners was so high as to likely represent mischievous responses (14 and 38 partners added
between interviews). After 1998, this item was dropped from the survey. For 2000 through
2012, a combination of items determined the number of partners. First, all participants who
consistently indicated “Never Married” as their marital status and never reported cohabiting
were coded as having no partners. Second, all participants who ever marked married, sepa-
rated, cohabited, divorced, or were widowed were counted as having a partner. Third, those
who indicated that they were no longer with their spouse or partner from a previous wave, and
were currently cohabiting or married, were counted as having an additional partner. Fourth,
those who reported that they had cohabited with or married an uncounted partner between
waves were coded as having an additional partner. The cumulative measure ranged from 0–17
(M = 1.05, SD = 1.32).
Controls.
Maternal race/ethnicity was coded as Hispanic, Black, and Non-Black, Non-
Hispanic. Maternal education at the child’s 18th year was measured using a series of categories
including less than high school (less than 12 years completed education), high school (12
years,), some college (13 to 15 years), college (16 years), and more than college (17 or more
years). Maternal employment was measured using mother’s retrospective weekly work
accounts collected at each interview. Respondent’s weekly work hours were averaged over the
year to produce measures of full time employment (more than 30 hours), part time employ-
ment (1–30 hours), or unemployment for that year (<1 hour per week on average). For each
child, we recorded the percentage of interviews between ages 0 and 18 in which the mother
reported each work status. Maternal relationship status at childbirth was coded as single,
cohabiting, or married using the mother’s relationship status report at the child’s year of birth.
For offspring who were born before 1979 (n = 814), relationship status was coded as married if
the mother was reported married at that date, otherwise was left to missing and imputed.
Those who were missing their marital or partnership status at the year of offspring’s birth were
also imputed. This method may undercount maternal cohabitation at the time of birth. Mater-
nal age at childbirth was measured in years (M = 23.74, SD = 4.83). Offspring gender was mea-
sured as 1 = Male. Offspring parental status was a dichotomous measure 1 = offspring
reported they had had a child before the interview date. Experience of Poverty denoted the per-
centage of interviews between the child’s birth and age 18 that mothers reported a household

 income below the federal poverty line appropriate for the year and size of the household [63].
Following previous studies using these data [64], mothers who were missing the measure of
income were coded as “in poverty” if they reported receiving at least $1 in governmental assis-
tance through Assistance for Families with Dependent Children or Food Stamps. Exposure to
cohabitation or marriage was coded as the percentage of interviews between the offspring’s
birth and 18 years that mothers reported themselves to be married or cohabiting. These vari-
ables were coded missing if mothers were missing marital or partnership status at any inter-
view and were imputed.
Missing data
Missing data were imputed using augmented multiple imputation by chained equations in
Stata14 [65]. In this method, each missing variable is the outcome in an appropriate regression
on all other variables in the model and missing values are replaced with predicted values. Val-
ues were imputed over 60 datasets and analyses were conducted on each dataset separately
with results pooled across models according to Rubin’s rules [66] using the MI suite of com-
mands in Stata14.
Analysis plan
Our dependent variable, offspring total partners, was a count variable with variance close to
the mean (σ2 = 1.83, M = 1.16), thus we elected to use Poisson regression for analyses [67].
Because some offspring were observed longer than others, the offspring’s age at final observa-
tion was used as the exposure variable and fixed using the exp([var]) option for Poisson com-
mands in Stata14 [68]. We first examined the association between offspring total partners and
maternal total partners controlling for maternal race, age at childbirth, union status at child-
birth, exposure to marriage and cohabitation, and offspring sex and parental status, and clus-
tered the standard errors by mother to account for siblings within families. To test the
economic hardship perspective, we then added socioeconomic controls, including maternal
education, employment, and poverty status, to the model. We also separately examined the
number of marital and cohabiting partners the mother experienced over the offspring’s life.
To test the intergenerational transmission of marriageable characteristics and relationship
skills perspective, we exploited our sibling data and conducted between-within, also known as
hybrid, sibling models [69]. Because the count of maternal partners was unique to each sib-
ling’s lifetime, 438 sibships varied on their maternal partner exposure, allowing us to test dif-
ferences between siblings while controlling for maternal characteristics that did not vary
between siblings (such as personality). A between-within sibling model is similar to a tradi-
tional random and fixed-effects model which use each participant as their own control over
time. The key difference is that rather than using each participant as their own control, each
offspring is compared to their sibling; maternal characteristics that do not vary by sibling are
thus accounted for in the model.
We elected to use the hybrid model for the ability to estimate the differences between sib-
lings within mothers as well as offspring of different mothers. Our hybrid model used group-
mean centered variables and included both the mean by mother and deviation from the mean
by each sibling in the model. This model is a good test of the intergenerational transmission of
marriageable characteristics and relationship skills perspective because we can measure varia-
tion both between children of different mothers and within families by comparing siblings to
each other. By including the variable mean for all sibling-variant maternal variables, the
between-within model [69] effectively positions the sibling model to exploit the variance in
exposure to maternal partners between siblings.

 Results
To test our first hypothesis that the significant association between maternal and offspring
partnering would become nonsignificant or be reduced after controlling for socioeconomic
factors, we used clustered Poisson regression models (see Table 2). Overall, mothers who had
more partners had offspring with significantly more partners. Poisson regression results can
be interpreted by Incident Rate Ratios (IRR, calculated as expb) and indicate the expected inci-
dent rate increase in the dependent variable from a one-unit increase in the independent vari-
able. Without controlling for socioeconomic factors, each additional maternal partner was
associated with a 6% incident rate increase in offspring partners. After controlling for socio-
economic factors, each additional maternal partner predicted a 5% incident rate increase in
offspring partners. These coefficients for maternal total partners did not significantly differ
between the two models when tested with Seemingly Unrelated Estimation using SUEST in
Stata14 (p = .09). In models with and without socioeconomic controls, maternal marital and
cohabiting partners were each significantly positively associated with offspring partners (see
Table 3). Posthoc analyses indicated that no significant difference in the marital and cohabit-
ing partners’ coefficients (p > .10). Compared to offspring with mothers who were non-Black
and non-Hispanic, offspring with Hispanic or Black mothers had fewer partners. Offspring
with mothers who were older at the offspring’s birth had significantly fewer partners, whereas

 offspring whose mothers were cohabiting at the offspring’s birth had significantly more part-
ners. Male offspring and those who were parents themselves had significantly more partners.
Offspring who spent a greater percentage of their childhood in poverty or with a mother who
worked fulltime reported a great number of partners. In contrast, offspring whose mother had
college education or more reported fewer partners. When data were examined by type of
union, Hispanic ethnicity, maternal cohabitation at offspring birth, and maternal fulltime
employment were no longer significant predictors of offspring partners, though the percentage
of childhood exposed to cohabitation became a positive, significant predictor.
Sibling model results
To test our competing second and third hypotheses, we examined sibling differences in the
association between maternal and offspring partnering using hybrid sibling Poisson regression
models (see Table 4). Between-family effects, displayed in the top of the table, corroborated the
pooled models; an increase in maternal partners was associated with a 5% greater incident rate
of offspring partners. However, the within-family effects, reported in the bottom of the table,
suggested that siblings were not significantly different from one another (p = .08). Findings by
type of maternal partners were similar to the pooled results between mothers: between-family

 effects indicated that both marital and cohabiting partners were significantly associated with
more offspring partners, but neither were associated with offspring instability within families.
Between family-effects of the control variables were similar to the clustered Poisson regression
models in that maternal race, maternal age at childbirth, maternal college education, child-
hood poverty, and offspring gender and parental status were all significantly associated with
offspring partnering. The within-family effects show that older siblings (that is, siblings born
to younger mothers) had significantly more partners, as did brothers compared to sisters and
siblings who were parents. Additionally, siblings exposed to cohabitation for more of their
childhoods reported more partners. Models by partner type replicated these findings.
Discussion
Half of first cohabitations will dissolve within three years, and half of first marriages will dis-
solve within twenty years [2, 3]. Those who experience union dissolution often repartner [4],
potentially having children with new partners [70]. Thus, family complexity continues to
increase in the United States [71]. Our results suggest that offspring whose mothers have mul-
tiple partners will be significantly more likely to have multiple partners themselves. We
extended research by Amato and Patterson [18] that found an intergenerational transmission
of family instability by focusing on partnering using prospective maternal data on union for-
mation and economic instability and exploiting sibling data in the NLSY79 and NLSY79 CYA.
We outlined three potential perspectives that could explain the intergenerational transmis-
sion of partnering. The economic hardship perspective suggested that the economic stress that
often accompanies union instability [27] contributes to greater offspring union instability and
thus increased partnering. Our results confirmed that childhood socioeconomic vulnerability
contributed to offspring partnering. Offspring who had more exposure to poverty reported
significantly more partners whereas offspring who had mothers with more education reported
fewer. Interestingly, offspring whose mothers worked full-time actually reported more part-
ners than those whose mothers did not work. Perhaps due to a lack of policy supports for
working families in the US, such as paid maternity leave, working mothers in the US are more
likely to divorce than those in other countries [72], increasing the risk of union dissolution for
their own offspring. Although socioeconomic factors were significantly associated with part-
nering, they did not significantly reduce the association between maternal partnering and off-
spring partnering, suggesting that the economic instability associated with partner transitions
did not explain the intergenerational transmission of partnering.
The transmission of commitment perspective [14] suggested that offspring who observed
their mother exiting marital and cohabiting unions, perhaps multiple times, learn that com-
mitments can be broken and that new partnerships can be formed that may be more beneficial
for the individual [11]. According to this perspective, witnessing the dissolution itself is the
mechanism driving increased partnering among offspring [14]. Based on this perspective, we

 expected that siblings who experienced different levels of maternal partnering would differ
from one another such that a sibling who experienced greater maternal partnering would be
more likely to experience more partnering compared to siblings who experienced less maternal
partnering. We did not find a significant differential sibling effect, and thus we did not find
specific evidence in support of the transmission of commitment perspective.
Our pattern of results most strongly supported the intergenerational transmission of mar-
riageable characteristics and relationship skills perspective. This perspective suggested that
mothers have certain characteristics that make them more or less desirable on the marriage
market and better or worse at relationships [21], and children inherit and learn these skills and
behaviors which they then take with them into their own intimate relationships [14, 73]. Off-
spring who experience poorer parental relationships may lack positive relationship skills, ren-
dering their own relationships less stable. Using sibling models to account for sibling invariant
maternal characteristics, we found that siblings reported similar levels of partnering even if
they differed in their experience of their mothers’ partnering. For example, a sibling who expe-
rienced their mother moving from a first union into a second did not have a statistically
greater number of partners compared to their half sibling who was born in their mother’s sec-
ond union. The overall findings thus support the assertion that the mechanism underlying the
intergenerational transmission of partnering may be the intergenerational transmission of
marriageable characteristics and relationship skills.
There is some evidence that the commitment perspective should be considered in future
research. Although not statistically significant, the association between maternal partnering
and within-family offspring partnering was positive and larger in magnitude than the
between-family effect. To further test the notion that maternal models of commitment may
also play a role in these findings, we tested differences in offspring exposure to cohabitation
versus marriage, both by the number of partners of each type the offspring witnessed and by
the percent of their childhood their mother was in each type of union. Because cohabiting
unions are most often less committed than marital unions [57] and often short lived [2],
greater exposure to maternal cohabitations was hypothesized to be more strongly associated
with offspring partnering than maternal marriage. We found no within-family (sibling) differ-
ences by type of maternal partner; rather, we found that experiencing more maternal cohabit-
ing and marital partners were similarly associated with greater offspring partnering. We did
find that siblings exposed to cohabitation longer experienced more partnering than their sib-
lings exposed to less cohabitation. Offspring exposed to cohabitation for longer durations may
come to view cohabitation as an attractive, lower-commitment union, which may open the
door to repartnering given cohabitation’s high dissolution rates [2].
Limitations
The NLSY79 and NLSY79 CYA datasets contain a wealth of information, yet have limitations.
First, the sample of mothers in the NLSY79 was nationally representative when data collection
began, but United States demographics have changed dramatically over the years and these
data no longer mirror demographics of the nation today. Second, the NLSY79 undercounts
maternal partnerships. Although participants could report themselves as being in an unmar-
ried partnership at the time of the survey each year, cohabiting unions that occurred between
surveys were not measured until later; thus, cohabitations were difficult to track and were
underestimated. Third, these data lack consistent measurement of mechanistic variables such
as relationship quality, stress, commitment, and mental health, which would have allowed us
to explore directly the transmissions of marriageable traits, relationship skills, and commit-
ment, rather than theoretically speculate as to the mechanisms. Future research should more

 closely examine the association between mother and offspring’ characteristics and behaviors
their association with union formation and dissolution. Further, longitudinal data on mar-
riageable traits and relationship skills, as well as commitment, would allow us to examine
whether these characteristics are consistent across unions, and across the adulthood years. It is
possible that relationship skills change from union to union, for example. Fourth, paternal
data were unavailable. Limiting data to maternal households fails to fully capture family com-
plexity [74]. Fifth, single mothers can have difficulty partnering into unions [75] and may
instead maintain sexual and dating relationships outside of coresidence. When single mothers
do date, their children may be involved in the dating process [76]. Thus, children of single
mothers may also witness their mother interacting with her sexual and dating partners, which
may further shape their perceptions of relationship functioning. These data do not have con-
sistent data on sexual and dating relationships that occurred outside of unions.
Right-censoring was also a threat to validity because offspring have not yet completed part-
nering. We controlled for offspring age, but additional data from further into the life course
may show a different pattern of results. A critique of sibling models is that parents may deliber-
ately attempt to make siblings similar (compensation) or different (selective investment) from
one another [77]. If compensation or selective investment were occurring in our sample and
the siblings were either artificially homogeneous or heterogeneous, the results of the hybrid
sibling fixed-effects model may be biased. These data did not allow us to assess compensation
or selective investment efforts. Another critique of sibling models is that these models do not
account for any influence that siblings may have on each other, which would likely lead sib-
lings to be more homogeneous than they would be without this influence. Data on sibling rela-
tionships, including contact, closeness, and even data on how siblings talk about relationships
[78] may suggest additional mechanisms underlying the intergenerational transmission of
partnering. Finally, unobservable characteristics that are shared between siblings, other than
those outlined by the transmission of marriageable characteristics and relationship skills per-
spective, could also be responsible for the transmission of partnering. For example, our mea-
sures of economic hardship were limited. The intergenerational transmission of parental
wealth and socioeconomic status may also be driving our results.
Finally, as noted in the introduction, partnering encompasses a number of different behav-
iors, including an individual’s choice to form a first union, dissolve or divorce a union, and
form a new union afterwards. Future work would do well to isolate the various components of
partnering shared by mothers and offspring to better understand the specific behaviors being
passed through generations.
Conclusion
We found that partnering was transmitted across generations in our sample of mothers and
their young adult offspring [18], even after accounting for prospective measures of economic
instability as well as sibling differences in partnering. Our findings suggest that the most plau-
sible mechanism underlying the intergenerational transmission of partnering may be the
transmission of poor marriageable characteristics and relationship skills, which can include
but are not limited to conflict resolution skills, personality, and mental health, although future
research should measure and test these characteristics directly. Poor marriageable characteris-
tics such as personality traits may actually be malleable [79] and the clinical psychological liter-
ature has consistently shown that relationship skills can be improved [80]. Yet the longevity of
the benefits of relationship interventions is up for debate [81] and these interventions appear
to have less utility for couples that are not white and middle-class [82]. If Finkel and Hui [83]
are correct and American’s expectations of their intimate relationships are at an all-time high,

 strategies to improve relationship skills may be of greater importance now than ever before
because relationship expectations are so hard to meet. On the other hand, if young adults
today are pruning their unions through serial monogamy [84] until they find a suitable partner
with compatible marriageable characteristics and relationship skills, we may see increased
union stability in later unions. Future research on current cohorts of young adults will shed
much needed light on contemporary family demography.
