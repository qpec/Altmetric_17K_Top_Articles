Increasing angiogenesis has long been considered a therapeutic target for improving heart
function after injury such as acute myocardial infarction. However, gene, protein and cell
therapies to increase microvascularization have not been successful, most likely because the
studies failed to achieve regulated and concerted expression of pro-angiogenic and
angiostatic factors needed to produce functional microvasculature. Here, we report that the
transcription factor RBPJ is a homoeostatic repressor of multiple pro-angiogenic and
angiostatic factor genes in cardiomyocytes. RBPJ controls angiogenic factor gene expression
independently of Notch by antagonizing the activity of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). In
contrast to previous strategies, the cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Rbpj increased
microvascularization of the heart without adversely affecting cardiac structure or function
even into old age. Furthermore, the loss of RBPJ in cardiomyocytes increased hypoxia
tolerance, improved heart function and decreased pathological remodelling after myocardial
infarction, suggesting that inhibiting RBPJ might be therapeutic for ischaemic injury.

 A
ngiogenesis in the adult heart is tightly regulated in order
to maintain cardiac function in response to workload1.
The
mechanisms
that
coordinate
angiogenesis
and
workload are poorly understood, but involve the regulated
secretion of angiogenic factors from cardiomyocytes2,3.
Increasing angiogenesis is of therapeutic interest to treat
chronic
myocardial
ischaemia,4,5
as
well
as
acutely
after
myocardial infarction since many patients have inadequate
perfusion despite restoration of coronary artery blood flow6.
Despite pre-clinical proof of concept, clinical trials of single
factor, gene and cell-based therapies have provided inconsistent
results, and identifying a definitive means of inducing clinically
useful therapeutic angiogenesis remains elusive4–6. A challenge in
achieving therapeutic angiogenesis is that the formation of
functional
vessels
involves
the
coordinated
activities
of
numerous factors, some of which promote endothelial cell
proliferation
and
vessel
sprouting
(for
example,
vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor
(FGF)), while others drive vessel remodelling and maturation
(for example, angiopoietins)7.
Since pressure overload increases myocardial angiogenesis and
activates Notch signalling8,9, we hypothesized that Notch and its
transcriptional effector RBPJ (recombination signal binding
protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region) might function in
cardiomyocytes
as
a
high
level
modulator
of
myocardial
angiogenesis. RBPJ is ubiquitously expressed, and can either
activate genes by forming a complex with the Notch intracellular
domain (NICD) when Notch is active10, or silence an overlapping
but non-identical set of genes by recruiting co-repressors in the
absence of Notch signalling11–13.
Our studies revealed that RBPJ represses the production of
pro-angiogenic and angiostatic factors in cardiomyocytes of the
unstressed heart, such that the adult cardiomyocyte (ACM)-
specific deletion of rbpj increases microvessel density, confers
physiological tolerance to hypoxia and protects the heart from
ischaemic injury. Contrary to expectations, activation of Notch
itself did not induce an angiogenic programme. We present
evidence that RBPJ controls angiogenic factor gene expression by
direct binding and inhibition of HIF1a and 2a. Thus, RBPJ has a
novel
Notch-independent
role
as
a
repressor
of
hypoxia
responsiveness and myocardial angiogenesis.
Results
RBPJ acts as a transcriptional repressor in healthy ACM. We
first investigated the location and activity of RBPJ in the mouse
adult heart. Nuclear-localized and faint cytoplasmic RBPJ is
readily detected in the adult heart, both in cardiomyocytes and
non-myocytes, and its level does not change substantially
following either chronic pressure overload by thoracic aortic
constriction
(TAC)
or
myocardial
infarction
(Fig.
1a,b;
Supplementary Fig. 1). In contrast, RBPJ was nearly undetectable
basally by immunostaining with the monoclonal antibody T6709
(ref. 14) (Fig. 1d), but was strikingly evident in response to a
doxycyclin-inducible, transgenic NICD (iNICD)15 (Fig. 1c,f) and
after TAC or myocardial infarction (MI) (Fig. 1e; Supplementary
Fig. 1c–f) coinciding with elevated expression of Notch ligands
(Supplementary Fig. 2a–d). T6709-detection correlates with
Notch activation14, suggesting that RBPJ in the heart might
repress gene expression basally and mediate Notch signalling after
MI and pressure overload.
To investigate the potential function of RBPJ in the heart, we
deleted Rbpj in ACM with Myl2-Cre (cKO). cKO mice had
normal
viability
consistent
with
post-natal
deletion
(Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). Deletion
increased expression of the endogenous Notch/RBPJ target genes
Hes1 and Hey2 identically to the effect of inducing Notch
activation (iNICD) in unstressed hearts (Fig. 1g,h), and increased
the
content
of
activating
tri-methylated
(K4)
histone-H3
(H3K4me3) in a proximal region of the endogenous Hes1 and
Hey2 promoter containing RBPJ-binding motifs (Fig. 1i). In vitro,
RBPJ
overexpression
repressed
a
Hes1
promoter-luciferase
reporter (Fig. 1j). Finally, Hes1 messenger RNA (mRNA) content
was
higher
in
isolated
cKO
relative
to
wild-type
(WT)
cardiomyocytes, and could be induced by adenoviral delivery
of NICD in an RBPJ-dependent manner (Fig. 1k). These data
indicate that RBPJ acts as a transcription repressor basally in
cardiomyocytes, but is converted to an activator upon pressure
overload or MI (Fig. 1l).
Lack of RBPJ induces angiogenesis in the heart. Next, we
evaluated the consequences of rbpj deletion. cKO hearts showed
no evidence of cardiomyocyte pathology (see Supplementary
Fig. 4 for a detailed phenotypic characterization), and responded
normally to pressure overload for all parameters analyzed,
including cardiac function (Supplementary Table 2) and hyper-
trophy (Supplementary Fig 5). However, the loss of RBPJ
significantly increased the number of capillaries relative to
cardiomyocytes (CC ratio) from 1.6±0.27 in WT hearts to
2.1±0.28 in cKO hearts (Fig. 2a–c). cKO capillaries were
morphologically normal even into old age (20 months, Fig. 2d,e),
and were perfused by ILB4 lectin to the same degree as WT
capillaries (Fig. 2f,g). Fibrinogen was not detected outside the
vessel walls (Fig. 2h–k), indicating that the capillaries were not
leaky, in contrast to capillaries following myocardial infarction as
a control (Fig. 2j,k), or following chronic hypoxia-inducible factor
(HIF) stabilization16,17. Thus, deletion of rbpj in cardiomyocytes
increased the density of functional capillaries without inducing
cardiac pathology.
Capillary density normally increases in response to chronically
elevated blood pressure. In WT mice, 2 weeks of TAC
significantly increased the CC ratio to 2.2±0.33. Myocardial
microvascularization did not increase after TAC in the cKO-RBPJ
mice beyond the already elevated basal level (1.9±0.17 CC ratio,
statistically indistinguishable from the basal level). One possible
explanation is that TAC signals through Notch/RBPJ to promote
angiogenesis. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, doxycycline-
activated iNICD did not affect the CC ratio (Fig. 2a), suggesting
that TAC-induced microvascularization does not involve Notch.
To probe the mechanism responsible for the increased
microvascularization, we profiled the expression of mRNAs
encoding 29 secreted angiogenic factors. Five were upregulated
in the cKO relative to WT, including factors involved in sprouting
and endothelial cell migration (for example, VEGF-A and PGF),
or stabilization (THBS2), and just a single factor (TGFb3) was
downregulated (Fig. 2l). iNICD did not upregulate any angiogenic
factor mRNAs (but downregulated Vegfa, Tnf and Ang2) despite
upregulating the canonical Notch/RBPJ target genes Hes1 and
Hey2 (Fig. 1j). Although consistent with no effect of iNicd on the
CC ratio, the result was puzzling since the angiogenic factor genes
behaved differently than canonical Notch/RBPJ target genes Hes1
and Hey2.
We investigated the divergent effects of the cKO and iNICD
genotypes on angiogenic factor expression using Vegfa as a
paradigm. Consistent with a Notch-independent role, VEGF-A
protein levels were elevated in cKO, but not iNICD, heart tissue
relative to WT controls (Fig. 2m,n; Supplementary Fig. 6).
Culture media conditioned by cKO isolated ACM showed an
increased ability to form microvascular endothelial tubes in vitro
relative to WT-conditioned media, and this increased activity was
blocked by the VEGF receptor inhibitor (carbozantinib) (Fig. 2o).
Taken together, the in vitro and in vivo data support the model
that RBPJ inhibits VEGF-A dependent angiogenesis. Chromatin

 immunoprecipitation revealed increased content of histone-H3
modifications (K9/K18Ac2 and K4me3) in the endogenous Vegfa
promoter in a region B1.5 kb upstream of the start site of
transcription that contains both RBPJ and HIF consensus motifs
(Fig. 2p; Supplementary Table 3). These epigenetic marks indicate
gene activation in the cKO cardiomyocytes. Activation was
reversed by the overexpression of RBPJ, and co-transfection with
a truncated-form of SHARP that physically sequesters RBPJ18
completely eliminated repression (Fig. 2q). Thus, RBPJ represses
Vegfa gene expression under unstressed conditions, and deleting
RBPJ leads to Vegfa gene activation (Fig. 2r).
Cardioprotection and hypoxia tolerance in rbpj cKO hearts.
Given the increased CC ratio in the cKO heart, we evaluated the
hemodynamic consequences deleting Rbpj. In addition to the
cKO genotype, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible Myh6-Cre19
knockout (icKO; Myh6mER-Cre-mER/ þ, Rbpjfl/fl) to afford precise
control over the timing of Rbpj deletion. Blood flow within left
ventricular myocardium was greater in the icKO and cKO hearts
than in WT controls (Fig. 3a). icKO and cKO mice (along with
genotype-specific WT controls) were subjected to acute hypoxia
by gradually decreasing ambient O2 from 21 to 5%. The different
groups (cKO, icKO and their WT controls) had similar
hemodynamic values under normoxic conditions (21% O2)
(Supplementary Table 4). At 5% O2, vascular resistance (VR)
increased as expected, but was significantly lower in cKO and
icKO than WT mice (Fig. 3b), correlating with elevated mean
arterial pressure (MAP) and cardiac output (CO) (Fig. 3c–f).
Although not statistically significant, O2 delivery at baseline and
5% O2 was greater in the cKO and icKO relative to WT (Fig. 3g).
Myocardial hypoxia (measured on histological section) in the
cKO and icKO was consistently diminished by 10–20% relative to
WT controls (Fig. 3h,i). Thus, loss of RBPJ in ACM correlated
with increased myocardial oxygenation and CO under hypoxia.
Since stimulating angiogenesis has been considered a potential
therapy for ischaemic disease5,6,20, we evaluated the response of
icKO mice to MI by serial echocardiography and histology
(Fig. 3j). The icKO hearts had increased CC ratio at baseline and
preserved cardiac function (Fig. 3l) and morphology (Fig. 3m)
relative to WT hearts post-MI (Fig. 3l,m), here measured in the

 demonstrating
that
the

effect
of
left
anterior
descending (LAD) occlusion was the same in both genotypes.
We conclude that deleting RBPJ improved tolerance to MI.
RBPJ physically inhibits HIFs. The preceding showed that
deleting RBPJ increases angiogenic factor gene expression and
microvessel density, correlating with improved cardiac function
after MI. We then investigated the mechanism responsible for the
puzzling finding that RBPJ represses angiogenic factor genes
basally, but that Notch/RBPJ does not induce them. Since
hypoxia is a major regulator of angiogenesis2,6,21, we examined
whether hypoxia responsiveness is altered by the cKO. Exposing
isolated ACM to severe hypoxia (1% O2) upregulated 13 and
downregulated 4 of the 29 secreted angiogenic factor genes
profiled relative to normoxia (21% O2) (Supplementary Fig. 7).
The response at 1% O2 was nearly identical in WT and cKO
genotypes. However, plotting the ratio of gene expression change
in cKO relative to WT revealed that the loss of RBPJ sensitized
angiogenic genes to induction by moderate hypoxia (6–3% O2)
(Fig. 4a).
Given that the � 1.5 kb region of the Vegfa promoter contains
both RBPJ and HIF consensus binding sites (Fig. 4b, inset;
Supplementary Table 3), we hypothesized that RBPJ might
interact with HIF to mediate repression. In a luciferase assay,
RBPJ repressed induction of the Vegfa promoter by hypoxia
(Fig. 4b) as well as by HIF1a or Hif2a (Fig. 4c) in a dose-
dependent manner.
Repression occurred identically with a mutant RBPJ containing
four mutations that block binding to recognition sites in DNA22
(Fig. 4d), suggesting that RBPJ does not need to interact with
DNA in order to inhibit HIF.
Overexpressed GFP-tagged RBPJ in HEK293T cells under
hypoxia was co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous HIF1a and
HIF2a (Fig. 4e), suggesting a physical interaction between the
proteins. Furthermore, a proximity ligation assay (PLA, Fig. 4f)
revealed that RBPJ co-localizes with both HIF1a and HIF2a in
ACM under normal and hypoxic conditions in vitro. Cytoplasmic
and nuclear co-localization was apparent, consistent with the
distribution
of
HIF
and
RBPJ
in
both
compartments
(Supplementary Fig. 8) and the ability of the RBPJ DNA-binding
mutant
to
antagonize
hypoxia
and
HIF-dependent
Vegfa
transcription.
To
control
for
non-specific
interactions,
no
fluorescent signal was detected in cKO cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4f).
Both HIF1a and HIF2a are detectable in WT and cKO mouse
hearts (Fig. 4g), although HIF2a is more prominent in nuclei
(65% (HIF2a) versus 15% (HIF1a) in WT cells) and increases
further in the cKO (80% (HIF2a) versus 15% (HIF1a) in cKO
cells) (Fig. 4h; Supplementary Fig. 9). These data indicate that
RBPJ physically interacts with HIF proteins basally, and that
repression is overcome by HIF stabilization under hypoxia.
Discussion
In summary, RBPJ regulates a paracrine circuit for myocardial
angiogenesis (Fig. 4i). RBPJ exerts control over microvessel
density by acting within cardiomyocytes to antagonize HIF1a and
HIF2a; therefore, desensitizing the angiogenic response to
hypoxia.
Deleting
RBPJ,
therefore,
increases
sensitivity
to
hypoxia. Attenuating RBPJ in cardiomyocytes is remarkable, in
that it benignly increases myocardial vascularization, increases
cardiac perfusion and output under hypoxia and preserves
cardiac function following MI. There are relatively few instances
of RBPJ having a repressive role in mammals23–25, and most
studies have focused primarily on its function as the effector of
Notch signalling, which is itself cardioprotective following
ischaemic injury8,9,26. The effect of RBPJ deletion resembles
chronic
adaptation
of
the
heart
to
hypoxia27
suggesting
that attenuating the suppressive function of RBPJ might be
therapeutic in the setting of ischaemic injury or chronic overload.
Methods
All animal handling and care followed the NIH Guide for Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. The experimental protocols were approved by Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committees of either the Sanford-Burnham-Prebys Medical
Discovery Institute, the University of California San Diego or Washington
University. Unless otherwise noted, approximately equal numbers of 8–16-week-
old male and female mice were used in all studies.
Genetic ablation of RBPJ in adult mouse hearts. To obtain cardiomyocyte-
specific deletion of RBPJ in adult mouse hearts we created the following mouse
lines. Myl2Cre/ þ transgenic mice (Black Swiss) were crossed to Rbpjflox/flox mice
(C57BL/6)28 to yield cKO (Myl2Cre/ þ, Rbpjflox/flox) and phenotypically WT
(Myl2 þ / þ, Rbpjflox/flox) littermates. Myh6cre/Esr1 transgenic mice19 were also
crossed to Rbpjflox/flox mice to obtain cKO Myh6mER-Cre-mER/ þ, Rbpjfl/fl and
phenotypically WT Myh6mER-Cre-mER/ þ, Rbpj þ / þ.
Tamoxifen induction of recombination. 4-OH tamoxifen (Sigma) prepared as
5 mg ml � 1 in corn oil was injected (0.1 ml per mouse) intraperitoneally at daily
intervals during a 14-day period that ended 5 days before LAD ligation, as
described29, or 30 days before physiology tests.
Genetic activation of Notch receptor in adult mouse hearts. aMHCrtTA;
tetO-NICD mouse line was previously generated15 to activate Notch signalling by
inducing NICD specifically in ACM. NICD was induced with doxycycline chow
(BioServ 200 mg kg � 1) during 2 weeks. aMHCrtTA and tetO-NICD littermates
fed doxycycline were used for comparison in all conditional gene expression
experiments unless otherwise noted. Littermate controls were used for all
experiments. Animal protocols involving these mice were approved by the Animal
Studies Committee at Washington University.
Statistical analysis. Data are shown as means ±standard error of the mean
(SEM) unless otherwise specified. P values were calculated by the Mann–Whitney,
the Student’s t-test or the one-way ANOVA, for samples n ¼ 3 and nZ4,
respectively, from independent biological replicates and the two-way ANOVA for
physiology experiments.
Heatmap analysis. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) data was internally normalized for each genotype and condition to
ActB levels. The amount of complimentery DNA (cDNA) used was titrated and
verified to yield cycle threshold (CT) values in the linear response range. All
conditions where normalized to the values of WT cells at 21% oxygen levels.
Resulting data was hierarchically clustered using Cluster 3.0 using the complete
linkage cluster method. Java TreeView software generated the colour map.
Inmunocytochemistry and histochemistry. Hearts were arrested in diastole by
perfusion with 300 mM KCl solution before fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in
PBS. They were then processed for either paraffin embedding or fresh frozen
directly in optimum cutting temperature compound (OCT) directly after collec-
tion. Briefly, paraffin sections (7 mm thick) were de-paraffinized, rehydrated and
heat-treated in Degloacker buffer pH 9 for antigen retrieval. After several PBS
washes, sections were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 �C
with the rat primary anti-RBPJ antibody (generously provided by Professor T.
Honjo, Kyoto University30) (1:50), rabbit monoclonal RBPJ (CST) (1:300 or
1:2,000), rabbit anti-Jagged-1 (SCBT) (1:300), rabbit anti-Delta-Like 4 (SCBT)
(1:100), mouse a-actinin (Sigma) (1:500), rabbit HIF1alpha (1:100 or 1:1,000 for
TSA) and HIF2 alpha (1:100 or 1:1,000 for TSA) (Nobus). After PBS washing,
sections were incubated with secondary antibodies. Either an HRP-conjugated anti-
rat IgG, HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, alexa fluor-conjugated (488 or 586) goat
anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG were applied for one hour at room temperature.
HRP was detected by DAB or by the thyramide signal amplification system
(Molecular Probes) for Hif1 and HIF2 alpha. To visualize microvessels, sections
were incubated with FITC-conjugated Lycopersicon esculentum agglutinin (FITC-
LEA, Sigma) (1:1,000) and Rhodamine-phalloidin (Invitrogen) (1:1,000) for 2 h in
PBS with calcium and magnesium, and subsequently counterstained with DAPI.
Sections were mounted and photographed on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with a
40 � objective (N.A. 0.75) or on a Zeiss Imager.Z1 plus apotome with 40 � (N.A.
1.2w) objectives.
Hif1 and HIF2 alpha antibodies were validated on heart tissue from embryonic
day E11.5 mouse where Hif1 and HIF2 alpha had been deleted. The genotype of the
HIF1 and HIF2 conditional KO mice correspond to FGata5 Cre þ � Hif1a F/ �
and FGata5 Cre/ þ � Hif2a F/ � , respectively. The FGata5 Cre mice have direct
Cre recombination in the epicardium as well as in regions of the myocardium31.

 For frozen sections, tissue was fresh frozen in OCT. Histological sections were
fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1) at � 20 �C for 2 min and processed as described
above, but the antigen retrieval step was omitted. Frozen sections were incubated
with goat anti-fibrin/fibrinogen (GAM/Fbg/Bio; Nordic Immunology) (1:500), rat
anti-mouse CD31 (BD-Pharmingen) (1:100), anti-alpha smooth muscle actin
(Sigma) (1:500) primary antibodies and alexa fluor-conjugated (488 or 586)
streptavidin or goat anti-rat or goat anti-mouse IgG (all 1:500). Biotin blocking was
performed as described for the Streptavidin/Biotin blocking kit (Vector Labs) on
those sections incubated with biotin-conjugated antibodies.
For histochemistry, hearts were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and processed for
paraffin embedding. Sections were stained for Massons’ trichrome (collagen stain),
PAS (periodic acid acid-Schiff) (to detect glycogen) and Oil red-O (to detect lipid)
following standard procedures (Sanford-Burnham-Prebys Histology Core Facility).
Sections were mounted and photographed on a TE300 Nikon microscope with
40 � (N.A. 0.75) objective.
For plastic casting of coronary vascular trees, Microfil polymer (Flow Tech,
Inc.) was perfused through the aorta of isolated hearts2. Mice had been previously
injected with heparin and the heart washed with saline solution to remove blood.

 After polymer injection hearts were processed following manufacturer’s
instructions and imaged on a Nikon SMZ stereo-microscope.
Electron microscopy. For transmitted electron microscopy, hearts were arrested
in diastole by perfusion with 300 mM KCl, dissected and sliced in 1 mm thick
sections and fixed in 2% pFA/2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer solu-
tion, pH 7.4. Slices were then washed and incubated in 1% osmium tetroxide in the
same buffer, dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in Eponate 12 epoxy resin
(Ted Pella Inc. C, Redding, CA, USA). Ultrathin sections were prepared on a
Reichert-Jung Ultracut microtome and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate,
and examined using a Hitachi H-600A electron microscope, at 75 kV. Digital
images were acquired with 2K � 2K CCD cooled monochrome 12-bit camera L3C
(SIA, Atlanta, GA, USA) using ‘‘Picture Frame’’ software (Optronics, Inc., Goleta,
CA, USA). Images were processed with ImageJ (public domain software) to achieve
a similarity in contrast and brightness of all images.
Imaging quantification. Imaging quantification was done with ImageJ.
Colocalization analysis was performed using a colocalization analysis plugin
(http://www.uhnres.utoronto.ca/facilities/wcif/imagej/colour_analysis.htm) that
generates Mander’s coefficients32. Determination of distances on images
(for example, Z-line and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area measurements) were
done by manually selecting the distances to be measured. For the analysis of the
size of ACM in vitro, brightfield images were process on ImageJ as described
(http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/docs/pdfs/examples.pdf) and quantified using the particle
size analysis function.
Intravital endothelial cell labelling. Mice were anesthesized by intraperitoneally
(i.p.) ketamine (100 mg kg � 1)-xylazine (2.5 mg kg � 1) injection followed by
injection with heparin (1,000 U kg � 1) to reduce formation of thrombi. To label the
endothelial cells intravitally, the anesthetized mice received a jugular injection of
0.1 ml FITC-conjugated Isolectin B4 (ILB4, Vector Lab). ILB4 was allowed to
circulate for 15 min. Mice were then sacrificed and hearts collected in 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde, washed in PBS, cryopreserved in sucrose, and embedded in OCT and
process for frozen sections.
ACM preparation and culture. ACM were isolated from 3 to5-month-old mice by
Langendorff perfusion method as described33. Before plating, cardiomyocytes were
separated from non-cardiomyocytes by sedimentation. Two hours after plating,
adenovirus was applied to the media at an MOI of B50 pfu per cell for 24 h. After
changing media on the next day, cardiomyocytes were incubated in a hypoxia
chamber (Biospherix XVivo, UK) under specified O2 tension, as indicated in the
text, for 24 h before collection of samples for gene expression analyses or
immunodetection.
Co-immunoprecipitation and western blot. For HIF1a and HIF2a interaction
with RBPJ, HEK 293 T (ATCC) cells were transfected with either mCherry
(negative control) or RBPJ-GFP expression vectors and subjected to hypoxia
(2% O2) overnight before total protein extraction. Total extracts were prepared by
incubating cells at 4 �C in lysis buffer (PBS with 0.5% Triton-X 100). Lysates were
centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000g to remove insoluble debris. Immunoprecipitation
was preformed by incubating total extracts with anti-GFP antibody (1:100)
preadsorbed to protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rocking for
1 h at 4C. Beads were then washed 3 � with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer prior to
resuspension in 1 � Laemli buffer and subjected to western blot. Antibodies used
for western blot were RBPSUH (D10A4) XP (Cell Signaling) (1:1,000), HIF-1 alpha
(NB100-479) (1:500) and HIF-2 alpha (NB100-122) (1:500).
In situ PLA and immunofluorescence. Isolated ACM seeded on coverslips were
fixed on cold methanol for 10 min. After washing with PBS and permeabilization
with 1% Triton X-100 cells were process for PLA or immunofluorescence.
For immunofluorescence, cardiomyocytes were incubated with blocking buffer
(5% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100) alone for 1 h and then with the primary antibodies
overnight at 4 �C. Excess of antibody was removed by several PBS washes and alexa
fluor-conjugated (488) secondary antibody with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin
(1:1,000) was applied with the blocking buffer for 1 h. After several PBS washes,
coverslips were mounted on slides with Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Labs) and
photographed.
The proximity ligation assay was performed on coverslips following the Duolink
In Situ User Manual (sigma.com/duolink) and using Duolink In Situ Solutions
(Sigma). First, we made PLA probes conjugating primary antibodies with a PLUS
or MINUS oligonucleotide. We used the Duolink In Situ Probemaker PLUS
(Sigma) for RBPJ antibody, RBPSUH (D10A4) XP (Cell Signaling) and MINUS for
HIF-1 alpha (NB100-479) and HIF-2 alpha (NB100-122) antibodies. After
blocking, cardiomyocytes were incubated with combinations of HIF-1 alpha probe
( � ) and RBPJ probe ( þ ), or HIF-2 alpha probe ( � ) and RBPJ probe ( þ )
overnight at 4 �C in a humidified chamber (all 1:250). After washing the antibody,
we performed the ligation and amplification steps as described (sigma.com/
duolink) using the Duolink In Situ Detecton Reagents Green (Sigma). After the
final washes we incubated cells with rodamine-conjugated phalloiding for 10 min
before mounting the coverslips on glass slides using Vectashield with DAPI (Vector
Labs).
Images were taken on a Zeiss Imager.Z1 plus apotome with 40 � (N.A. 1.2w)
objectives and processed with ImageJ (NIH, Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U. S.
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/,
1997–2014).
Protein analysis. Mouse VEGF-A ELISA (Biosource, Invitrogen) was performed
following manufacturer’s instructions. ACM were isolated as described (see above)
from WT sham and TAC mice and immediately collected on RIPA lysis buffer.
Western blots were performed as described34. Briefly, samples were loaded and run
on a 4–12% TGX-precast gels (Bio Rad) after being heated on 2 � Laemmli sample
buffer with b-mercaptoethanol (Bio Rad) for 10 min at 70 �C. proteins were then
transferred using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio Rad) into PVDF
membranes that were blocked with 5% Difco skin milk (BD Bioscience) before
antibody incubations. Antibodies used were rat primary anti-RBPJ (1:500)
antibody (generously provided by Professor T. Honjo, Kyoto University30), ANF
(1:500) (Millipore, AB5490) and GAPDH (1:2,000) (Abcam, ab9485).
Endothelial tube formation assay. A microvascular endothelial tube formation
assay was performed as described35 to quantify microvessel formation in response
to factors produced by the WT and cKO cardiomyocytes. Briefly, media
conditioned by 18 h culture of mouse ACM was collected and centrifuged to
remove dead cells and debris. The conditioned media was then applied to human
microvascular endothelial (HMEC1) cells plated in 96-well plates previously coated
with matrigel (7–8 mg ml � 1, 45 ml well � 1). The cultures were incubated for an
additional 16 h either with or without the VEGF receptor inhibitor carbozantinib
(Selleckchem). After the 16 h culture period, the angiogenic response was
quantified automatically by determining the number of junctions formed using the
macro ‘Angiogenesis Analyzer’ by Gilles Carpentier (Gilles Carpentier.
Contribution: Angiogenesis Analyzer, ImageJ News, 5 October 2012) for NIH
Image J 1.47v Program.
RNA extraction and qRT-PCR. RNA was extracted from cells and tissue using
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and cDNA was made using the Qiagen Reverse
Transcription kit. PCR with specific primers (see Supplementary Tables 5 and 6)
was performed using the LightCycler FastStart Master SYBR Green Kit (Roche) in
a LightCycler 2.0 (Roche). Gapdh and b-actin (Actb) were used as internal controls
to normalize the data, as specified in the text.
For the angiogenic gene analysis, quantitative Real-Time PCR was performed
for the different samples using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad) and loaded
on a ABI 7900HT. Values are expressed either as 2DDCt, with DDCt defined as the
difference in crossing threshold (Ct) values between experimental and control
samples as described36 or as Log10 2DCt using Actb (b-actin) as control gene.
Luciferase assay. Luciferase reporter constructs were transfected into HEK293T
cells on 24 or 384 well plates with Lipofectamine LTX. Overall, 24 h after trans-
fection, cells were placed under hypoxia for 12–20 h as above. Samples were pro-
cessed to assay luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega).
Luciferase activity was normalized against total protein content quantified by
Bradford colorimetric analysis (Pierce). pHes1 was a gift from Jan Jensen
(Cleveland Clinic, Ohio); mouse 1.6 Kb pVegfa–Luc from Patricia D’Amore37
(Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA), pSharp (2002-3664) DeltaB and
pRbpj from Franz Oswald (Max-Planck-Institute of Immunobiology, Germany),
HA-HIF1alpha-pcDNA3 and HA-HIF2alpha-pcDNA3 was a gift from William
Kaelin (Addgene plasmid # 18949 and Addgene plasmid # 18950, respectively)38.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. ChIP assays were performed
using previously described methods39. Briefly, ACM from WT and RBPJ cKO
mouse hearts were collected, fixed in 2% formaldehyde 12 min at room
temperature, rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS, and lysed directly in sonication buffer
(1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris–HCl pH8.0 and protease inhibitors cocktail
(Sigma)). The resulting cell suspension was sonicated in a waterbath sonicator
(MiSonix Sonicator 3000) using the following programme: 30 s ON, 30 s OFF
during10 min (Output Power: 4). The suspension was centrifuged (Eppendorff
microfuge) and the cleared supernatant was incubated at 4 �C overnight
with an antibody to di-acetylated Histone3 (K9, K18) (Millipore, 07-593) or to
tri-methylated Histone3 (K4) (Abcam Ab8580) (both 1 mg/106 cells). Normal rabbit
IgG was the negative control (1 mg/106 cells). Protein-DNA complexes were
collected on Protein G beads (SIGMA). After rinsing in PBS, the final DNA
samples were subjected to PCR. Primer sets specific for the mouse Vegfa, proximal
promoters spanning Hif and RBPJ-binding sites were synthesized for this purpose
(Supplementary Table 3). PCR conditions were 95 �C for 2 min, followed by

 administered i.p., and connected to a rodent ventilator after tracheal intuba-
tion40,41. The chest cavity was opened with scissors by a small incision at the level
of the second intercostal space. After isolation of the aortic arch, a 7–0 silk suture
was placed around the aorta and a 27-gauge needle. The needle was immediately
removed to produce an aorta with a stenotic lumen. The chest cavity was then
closed with one 6–0 nylon suture and all layers of muscle and skin closed with 6–0
continuous absorbable and nylon sutures, respectively. Sham-treated animals
underwent surgery without the final tightening of the constrictive suture40,41.
Gradients across the stenotic aorta were measured through echocardiographic
analysis, and animals with pressure gradients less than 30 mmHg were not included
in the study. Echocardiography was as described42. Both males and females were
used and no significant gender difference was noted.
Hearts were collected at 14 days after the surgery, arrested in 300 mM KCl and
fixed in 4% PFA, or fresh frozen in OCT for histological analysis or, frozen, and
stored at � 80 �C for RNA and protein extraction.
MI mouse model. The protocol was essentially as described43. Briefly, an oblique
8-mm incision was made 2 mm away from the left sternal border toward the left
armpit (1–2 mm below). The muscles were separated with care to avoid damaging
blood vessels. The chest cavity was then opened at the 4th intercostal space taking
care not to damage the lung. A chest retractor was inserted and opened gently to
spread the wound to 8–10 mm in width. The pericardium was gently picked up
with curved and straight forceps, pulled apart, and placed behind the arms of the
retractor. The LAD coronary artery runs in the midst of the heart wall from
underneath of the left atrium toward the apex and was typically visible by its
pulsating bright red colour. In instances when the LAD artery could not be
visualized, the left atrium was lifted so that the source of the LAD artery from the
aorta is located. The position of the ligation depends on the volume of infarction
desired. In this study, the LAD artery was ligated 1–2 mm below the tip of the left
atrium in its normal position, which induces roughly 40–50% ischaemia of the LV.
Once the site for ligation had been determined, the curved forceps were used to
gently press on the artery a little below the subsequent ligation (to enhance the view
of the artery and stabilize the heart). Next, with a tapered needle, a 7–0 silk ligature
was passed underneath the LAD coronary artery. For easier and smoother passage
the needle was bent in advance to make the curvature rounder. The ligature was
then tied with three knots. Occlusion was confirmed by the change of colour
(becoming pale) of the anterior wall of the LV. The chest cavity was then closed by
bringing together the 4th and the 5th ribs with one or two 6–0 nylon sutures
(with pressure applied to the chest wall to reduce the volume of free air). The
muscles and skin were closed layer-by-layer with 6–0 absorbable and nylon sutures,
respectively. The sham-operated mice underwent the same procedure without tying
the suture but moving it behind the LAD artery. Both males and females were used
and no significant gender difference was noted.
Animal preparation for cardiac function measurements. Anaesthesia was
induced by i.p. injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg kg � 1) and core body
temperature was maintained using a heating pad. Animal preparation included: (i)
left femoral artery catheterization, (ii) tracheotomy (polyethylene-90 tube to
facilitate spontaneous breathing), and (iii) left ventricle conductance catheter
introduction through the right carotid artery. Animals were placed in the supine
position on the heating pad, before the experimental procedure. Toe pinching test
was performed at least every 5 min, and animals who responded received a small
dose of sodium pentobarbital (10 mg kg � 1) to prevent animal discomfort. Mice
were suitable for the experiments if: (1) systemic parameters were within normal
range, namely, heart rate (HR)4300 beat min � 1, MAP490 mmHg, and arterial
O2 partial pressure (paO2)480 mmHg. Only males were used for these cardiac
function measurements. Detailed protocols are described below.
Hypoxia protocol for cardiac function. The anesthetized animals were placed on
heating pad within seal acrylic box. As described before for awake animals, the O2
concentrations in the box was changed using compressed air, 15% O2 balance N2,
10% O2 balance N2; and 5% O2 balance N2. Each hypoxic step was maintained for
30 min, and measurements were completed 15 min after animal’s acclimatization.
Hypoxia was stopped if blood pressure dropped below 40 mmHg, and the animal
was excluded from the study.
Systemic parameters. MAP and HR were recorded continuously (MP 150,
Biopac System; Santa Barbara, CA, USA).
Cardiac function. The closed chest method was used to study cardiac function.
Right common carotid artery was exposed to insert a 1.4F pressure-volume con-
ductance catheter (PV catheter; SPR-839, Millar Instruments; Houston, TX, USA).
The pressure-volume catheter was advanced passing through the aortic valve into
the LV44. At baseline and the end of the experiment, a bolus of 15% hypertonic
saline (10 ml) was intravenously injected to determine parallel volume 45. The
pressure and volume signals were continuously acquired (MPVS300, Millar
Instruments; Houston, TX, USA and PowerLab 8/30, AD Instruments; Colorado
Springs, CO, USA). Left ventricular volume was measured continuously in
conductance units (RVU; relative volume unit) and converted to actual blood
volume (ml) at the end of the experiment.
Cardiac pressure–volume indices. Cardiac function data were analyzed with
PVAN software (Millar Instruments, Houston, TX, USA). All cardiac function
parameters were averaged from 8 to 12 cardiac cycles at each time point. End
systolic pressure (Pes) was directly measured. Cardiac output (CO), stroke work
(SW) and stroke volume (SV) were calculated. VR was calculated as using the MAP
divided by the CO (VR ¼ MAP/CO). Oxygen delivery (DO2) was calculated as the
product of the total Hb by the O2 carrying capacity of saturated Hb (1.34 mLO2/
gHb) by the arterial blood O2 saturation and CO
(DO2 ¼ [RBCHb � 1.34 � SA] � CO)46.
Hypoxic areas. Hypoxia protocol for awake mice were followed as mentioned
earlier. Vital organ hypoxic areas were measured using immunohistochemistry
staining for pimonidazole bound to hypoxic zones. Mice received an infusion of the
hypoxic marker Hypoxyprobe-1 (pimonidazole 40 mg kg � 1) and 5 mg kg � 1
Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) diluted in PBS (total
volume, 100 ml), when they were exposed to 10% O2. Then, the mice received a
second infusion of pimonidazole (40 mg kg � 1) and Hoechst 33342 (5 mg kg � 1)
diluted in PBS (100 ml), when they were exposed 5% O2. Finally, mice were
euthanized and their heart was removed. Tissues were fixed by immersion in
formalin for 24 h at room temperature before transfer to 70% (v/v) ethanol. Lastly,
tissues were cut into 100-mm thick sections.
Pimonidazole immunohistochemistry. Sections were cleaned and rehydrated
according to standard procedures. Monoclonal antibody directed against pimoni-
dazole (included in the Hypoxyprobe-1 green kit) was used for immunohisto-
chemical staining of the tissue sections. Fluorescence microscopy was performed
using an Olympus BX51WI equipped with a high resolution digital CCD ORCA-
285 (Hamamatsu Corp., Hamamatsu city, Japan) illuminated with a mercury
burner and the appropriate fluorescent cubes (XF100-2 and XF02-2, Omega
Optical, Brattleboro, VT). Images for pimonidazole antibody-stained areas and
Hoechst were prepared using Wasabi Imaging Software (Hamamatsu Corp). The
ratio of pixels stained for pimonidazole in each region, to the total cellular area of
the image was calculated. Ten images were analyzed by section, and the results
were pooled to determine the mean and standard deviation. To indicate the
co-localization of pimonidazole and Hoechst in cell, images were superimposed.
