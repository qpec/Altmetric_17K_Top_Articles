The biological determinants of sensitivity and resistance to immune checkpoint blockers are
not completely understood. To elucidate the role of intratumoral T-cells and their association
with the tumor genomic landscape, we perform paired whole exome DNA sequencing and
multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) in pre-treatment samples from non-
small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients treated with PD-1 axis blockers. QIF is used
to simultaneously measure the level of CD3+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), in situ
T-cell proliferation (Ki-67 in CD3) and effector capacity (Granzyme-B in CD3). Elevated
mutational load, candidate class-I neoantigens or intratumoral CD3 signal are significantly
associated with favorable response to therapy. Additionally, a “dormant” TIL signature is
associated with survival benefit in patients treated with immune checkpoint blockers
characterized by elevated TILs with low activation and proliferation. We further demonstrate
that dormant TILs can be reinvigorated upon PD-1 blockade in a patient-derived
xenograft model.

mmunomodulatory therapies using monoclonal antibodies to
block the co-inhibitory receptors programmed death-1 (PD-1)
and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4)
have revolutionized the treatment of diverse tumor types,
including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Treatment with
PD-1 axis blockers induces tumor response in approximately
20% of unselected patients with advanced NSCLC1–4. The
combination of PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockers results in greater
anti-tumor effect than monotherapy regimens in melanoma, and
is currently being evaluated in NSCLC5–8. Despite unprecedented
durability of response, the majority of NSCLC patients receiving
PD-1 axis blockers do not derive clinical benefit. Clearly, pre-
dictive biomarkers to select patients for these therapies are
required. In addition, understanding the biological determinants
that mediate sensitivity and resistance to immune checkpoint
blockade could support design of optimal treatment modalities.
Diverse studies have shown that tumor PD-L1 protein expression
using chromogenic immunohistochemistry (IHC) can enrich for
responders to PD-1 blocking agents1–4. Expression of PD-L1 in
NSCLC (and other tumor types) is associated with increased
tumor immune infiltration and local IFN-γ production, suggest-
ing its adaptive modulation in the tumor microenvironment9,10.
Although four PD-L1 IHC tests have been approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration for clinical use (e.g., 22C3, 28-8,
SP263, and SP142), there can be discordance between results
from different assays, and a negative test does not preclude
response to PD-1 axis inhibitors. Additional factors have also
been associated with response to PD-1 axis blockade including
increased CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)11,12, TIL
PD-1
expression11,
clonally
expanded
T-cell
populations11
and elevated somatic mutations or candidate MHC class-I
neoantigens12–14. The biological link between these factors and
potential predictive value of combining them remain uncertain.
Recent studies have shown that an elevated tumor mutational
load or predicted class-I neoantigen content is associated with
higher response rate and survival to PD-1 or CTLA-4 blockade in
melanoma14–17. Similar findings have been reported in patients
with mismatch-repair deficient carcinomas and NSCLCs treated
with PD-1 axis blockers12,13. This supports the hypothesis that
tumors with more mutations likely generate more neoepitopes,
which can be recognized by TILs. Treatment with immune
checkpoint blocking antibodies can stimulate neoantigen-specific
TILs and mediate tumor regression. Additional studies indicate
that neoantigens present at higher allelic frequency within the
tumor population (e.g., “clonal” neoantigens) are biologically
more relevant18. However, neoantigen specific lymphocytes have
been found at relatively low levels and only against a few of the
mutant epitopes detected in the tumor13,17,19–21. In addition,
there are tumors with relatively low mutational burden which are
sensitive to immune checkpoint blockers such as renal cell car-
cinomas22. Previous reports from melanoma, NSCLC, and
mismatch-repair deficient carcinomas also indicate that some
tumors harboring extremely elevated mutational load do not
derive clear benefit from PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade12,13,16.
Analyses of the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset has
linked the presence of elevated mutations or candidate MHC
class-I
neoantigens
with
increased
levels
of
perforin
and
granzyme-A mRNA transcripts, suggesting a link between the
level of genomic alterations and effective anti-tumor immune
responses23. However, the cell types producing these cytolytic
enzymes were not determined and the association was evident
only in some tumor types such as cervical (HPV-positive) car-
cinoma, lung, and colorectal adenocarcinomas; but not in mela-
noma, bladder and lung squamous cell carcinomas. Additional
studies using the TCGA database showed that lung squamous
tumors display reduced markers of effective immune surveillance
compared to lung adenocarcinomas despite having comparable
candidate neoantigen levels18. The lower anti-tumor immune
response in squamous carcinomas was associated with low
expression
of
antigen
presentation
genes,
suggesting
that
mechanisms different from the mutational load can modulate
the anti-tumor immune response in this malignancy. Using
whole exome DNA sequencing and multiplexed quantitative
in situ immunofluorescence, we studied the association between
the mutational landscape, local anti-tumor T-cell responses and
clinical benefit to immune checkpoint blockers in patients
with NSCLC. We identified and experimentally validated a
“dormant” TIL signature associated with sensitivity to PD-1 axis
blockade that is independent from the tumor mutational burden
and PD-L1 expression.
Results
Mutations neoantigens and immune checkpoint blockade. To
characterize the mutational landscape of our cohort and its
association with clinical response, we performed whole exome
DNA
sequencing
analysis
of
pre-treatment
formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) NSCLC samples from 49 patients
treated with immune checkpoint blockers. The mean target
coverage was 206.3× and 97.08% of nucleotides read at least 20×.
The average somatic mutation load was 633.27 (range 10–6926)
with a median of 346. The average nonsynonymous mutational
load was 444.7 (range 5–4577) with a median of 252. The asso-
ciation between the total mutational load and the number of
nonsynonymous variants was high (Spearman’s correlation
coefficient [R] = 0.99, P < 0.0001). As shown in Fig. 1a, cases with
a mutational burden above the median of the cohort showed a
3.6-fold higher frequency of durable clinical benefit (DCB) than
cases with lower mutational content (60 vs 16.7% with DCB,
respectively, P = 0.05, Fisher’s extact test). In addition, highly
mutated tumors had 2.6-fold higher frequency of variants in
genes associated with DNA repair (e.g., MLH3, MSH6, POLD1,
POLE, etc.) than cases with low mutations, but this difference
did not reach statistical significance (32% vs 12.5%, respectively,
P = 0.31, Fisher’s extact test). As expected for a NSCLC popula-
tion, the majority of cases displayed a mutational signature with
predominance of C>A transversions, previously reported to be
associated with tobacco exposure (Fig. 1a)13,24.
We then identified candidate class-I neoantigens through a
bioinformatic pipeline including: (i) In silico translation of the
nonsynonymous mutant sequences into 17-mer polypeptides
flanking the mutant amino acid; (ii) calculation of mutant
nonamers with IC50 below or equal to 500 nM to bind patient-
specific class-I HLA alleles; and (iii) determination of the
predicted recognition of mutant sequences by T-cells13,23,25. As
shown in Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1, we identified a
mean of 138.8 candidate MHC class-I neoantigens per case (range
2–2331), 25.9% of which were predicted to be high affinity
binders (e.g., with a calculated IC50 ≦ 50 nM), 26.8% intermediate
binders (with a calculated IC50 50–150 nM) and 47.3% weak
binders (with a calculated IC50150–500 nM). There was a high
correlation between the mutational load and predicted class-I
neoantigen
content
(Spearman’s
R = 0.95,
P < 0.0001),
as
reported12,23. Both the nonsynonymous mutational load and
the number of in silico predicted MHC class-I neoantigens
were significantly higher in cases with DCB than in patients
without DCB after immune checkpoint blockade (P = 0.0004
and P = 0.0009, respectively, Mann–Whitney test [Fig. 1b, c]).
However,
some
patients
with

mutations/neoantigens

 nonsynonymous mutational load to predict DCB was 78.9% and
the specificity was 66.6%. The most frequently mutated cancer-
related gene in the cohort was TP53 (57.1%). We found no
significant difference in the relative frequency of specific
oncogenic mutations (Supplementary Figure 2), global loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) (Supplementary Figure 3) or in the amount
of copy number variations (CNVs, Supplementary Figure 4)
between patients with and without DCB. Increased nonsynon-
ymous mutational load was significantly associated with longer
progression free survival (Fig. 1d, P = 0.005, test). However, we
found no significant association between the level of mutations
and overall survival at 3-years using the same stratification cut-

association with survival was seen using the number of candidate

HLA binding and T-cell responses to mutant neopeptides.
Experimental validation of the HLA binding capacity of in
silico predicted class-I mutant neoantigenic peptides found
in NSCLC (Table 1) was performed by measuring the stabiliza-
tion of HLA-A2 protein after incubation of B lymphoblastoid
LCL-174 cells lacking MHC-II genes and TAP proteins, with
recombinant mutant 9-mer peptides. As shown in Fig. 2a, b, 9
out of 13 (67.9%) predicted mutant neopeptides found in
tumor samples obtained over the course of treatment in a
patient with HLA-A*0201 HLA type showed positive surface
fluorescence signal, indicating effective peptide-class-I MHC
binding. The predicted affinity of the mutant peptide-HLA-A2
interaction was correlated with the in vitro stabilization scores,
showing the highest HLA-A2 signal in those cases with the lowest
predicted IC50. Notably, four out of five mutant peptides with
predicted IC50 > 100 nM failed to show detectable HLA stabili-
zation, indicating limited actual binding. In addition, the pre-
dicted binding affinity of the mutant relative to the non-mutated
peptides was prominently higher (mean IC50 103.6 ± 33.2 for the
mutant peptides vs 2541 ± 1218 for the wild type sequences).
We then tested whether the predicted mutant neopeptides
could
elicit
a
functional
T-cell
response
in
lymphocytes
derived from peripheral blood from the same NSCLC patient.
To this end, we cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) and sepatared monocytes for in vitro maturation (see
'Methods' section). Neoantigen-specific T-cells were expanded
by stimulation with a pool of eight tumor neopeptides (peptide
pool #1) exhibiting a range of predicted HLA-A2 binding
affinities in the presence of autologous mature dendritic cells.
The
cell
preparations
were
subsequently
stimulated
with
artificial antigen presenting cells (APCs) K562 expressing HLA-
A2 and 4-1BBL in the presence of peptide pool #1 followed by
re-stimulation after one week with the same APCs in the presence
or
absence
of
the
peptide
pool.
Additionally,
a

(peptide

containing

was used as an irrelevant peptide set for negative reactivity

 peptide pool #1 induced a positive response of T-cells dually
expressing IFN-γ and TNF-α in 1.1% of the CD8+ population,
indicative of T-cell recognition of the mutant neopeptides. This
change was >15-fold higher than in T-cells stimulated with APCs
in the absence of peptides or in the presence of the irrelevant
peptide pool #2. In a separate experiment using individual
peptides, five of the eight peptides in pool #1 elicited a detectable
CD8+ T-cell response.
Mutational load oncogenic drivers and tobacco consumption.
As expected, the mutational load was positively correlated
with the amount of cigarrete consumption (Spearman’s R = 0.42,
P = 0.01, Fig. 3a). Tumors harboring activating mutations in
EGFR had significantly lower somatic mutations and predicted
MHC class-I and class-II neoantigens than KRAS-mutant and
EGFR/KRAS wild type tumors (P < 0.01, Mann–Whitney test
Fig. 3b, c). Although the tumors lacking mutations in EGFR
and KRAS showed a higher mutational/candidate neoantigen
level than KRAS-mutant carcinomas, this difference was not
statistically significant. As expected, Exon 19 deletions were
the most common EGFR mutations (50% of EGFR mutant cases)
and all KRAS variants were located in codon 12 with G12C being
the most frequently detected (54% of KRAS mutant tumors)
(Fig. 3d, e).

 39 cases from the cohort with available tumor tissue. Our QIF
panel included DAPI to highlight all cells/nuclei in the sample,
cytokeratin (CK) to stain tumor epithelial cells, CD3 for T-lym-
phocytes, granzyme-B (GZB) for T-cell activation and Ki-67 for
cell proliferation. We then measured the level of CD3 as a metric
of T-cell infiltration and the amount of GZB and Ki-67 in CD3-
positive cells as indicators for T-cell activation and proliferation,
respectively. The design and performance of this panel was
validated using control FFPE preparations of human tonsil,
lymph node and unstimulated (control) human PBMCs or
PBMCs stimulated for 72 h with anti-human CD3 monoclonal
antibodies (clone OKT-3) (Supplementary Figure 6). The level of
CD3 signal showed a continuous distribution and a wide range
going from virtually no TILs to prominent T-lymphocyte infil-
tration (Fig. 4a). As shown in the Supplementary Figure 7, the
stromal CD3 signal (CD3 in CK-negative areas) was 2.5 fold
higher (P < 0.001, Mann–Whitney test) than in the tumor (CD3
in CK-positive areas), indicating that the majority of the T-cells
were located in the stromal compartment. However, the stromal
and tumor CD3 levels were positively correlated. The level of
CD3 signal was not correlated with the level of T-cell GZB
(Spearman’s R = 0.23, P = 0.14) and only modestly correlated
with T-cell proliferation (Spearman’s R = 0.41, P = 0.01). The
level of T-cell infiltration was 2.4 fold higher in cases with DCB
(P = 0.02; Mann-Whitney test Fig. 4b). The level of TIL activation
or proliferation was not associated with the presence or absence
of DCB (Fig. 4c, d).
Stratification of the cases into three groups based on their
median CD3, T-cell GZB, and T-cell Ki-67 levels identified
tumors with a “dormant” TIL phenotype (or Type 2) character-
ized by elevated CD3 but low T-cell GZB and low T-cell Ki-67 as
the one with the highest rate of DCB (86% of cases with DCB)
and longest progression free and overall survival (Fig. 4e–g).
Representative multicolor fluorescence pictures of the tumors
showing the three distinct QIF-based TIL patterns are shown
in Fig. 4e.

 blockers, we measured the levels of T-cell infiltration, activation,
and proliferation in a retrospective collection of 110 stage I–IV
NSCLCs not treated with immunotherapy and represented in
tissue microarray (TMA) format (Fig. 5). Similar to the treated
cases, the level of CD3+ cells in lung tumors was variable and not
directly associated with the markers of T-cell activity/prolifera-
tion (Fig. 5b). There was a moderate positive association between
the levels of T-cell GZB and Ki-67 (Spearman’s R = 0.43, Fig. 5c).
However, in this population the group with the “dormant” TIL
phenotype (Type 2) was not associated with survival benefit,
supporting the notion that the presence of inactive TILs is
associated with better outcome only in patients treated with
immune checkpoint blockers. Notably, the group with a Type 3

 GZB and/or Ki-67 showed a clear trend toward better survival in
this population (P = 0.09, log-rank test, Fig. 5d).
PD-1 blocking antibodies can reinvigorate dormant TILs. To
experimentally demonstrate the cytolytic activation/proliferation
of “dormant” TILs upon PD-1 axis blockade, we engrafted sur-
gically resected primary lung cancer explants subcutaneously in
immune deficient mice and administered intraperitoneally anti-
PD-1 monoclonal antibodies. Because we did not perform any
tumor passage in mice, this surgical lung cancer explants contain
tumor and also original patient-derived TILs. After treatment,
cells were isolated from the resected tumor specimens and ana-
lyzed using mass cytometry. As shown in Fig. 6a, b, human CD3+
TILs displaying low basal GZB and low Ki-67 prominently
increased the levels of both markers in animals treated with PD-1
blockade but not in control mice. The largest difference before and
after treatment was seen in T-cells expressing Ki-67 alone or Ki-67
plus GZB (Fig. 6b). Notably, Ki-67 was predominantly increased
in CD4+ T-lymphocytes and GZB was higher in the CD8+
population (Fig. 6c). Further characterization of TILs after PD-1
blockade showed elevated levels of T-BET and TIM-3 in T-cells
with increased proliferation and higher levels of EOMES and
HLA-DR in the GZB-high subpopulation. The fraction of T-cells
showing increased Ki-67 and GZB was predominantly CD8+ with
relatively high levels of T-BET, EOMES, TIM-3, and HLA-DR.
Mutations PD-L1 expression and T-cells in NSCLC. Notably,
the level of somatic mutations and predicted class-I neoantigens
were not significantly different across the three TIL NSCLC
subtypes and the majority of cases with very high mutational load
or candidate neoantigens displayed a type 1 pattern (Fig. 7a, b).
EGFR mutant cases showed significantly lower levels of T-cell
infiltration than tumors lacking EGFR and KRAS mutations
(P = 0.03, Mann–Whitney test Fig. 7c). KRAS mutant tumors
showed approximately 2-fold higher CD3 signal than those with
EGFR mutations, but this difference was not statistically sig-
nificant. The level of GZB and Ki-67 in T-cells was not different
across major molecular variants of lung adenocarcinoma. There
was a low association between the nonsynonymous mutational
load and the level of T-cell infiltration, T-cell activation and
proliferation (Spearman’s R = 0.04–0.17, Fig. 7d–f). Consistent
with this, the effect of the mutational load and the TIL groups
were independently associated with overall survival in a multi-
variable
Cox
proportional
hazard
model
(Supplementary
Table 5). As shown in the Supplementary Figure 8, the mutational
burden (Supplementary Figure 8A) and the TIL subtypes (Sup-
plementary Figure 8B) were not associated with the levels of
tumor PD-L1 protein expression as measured using chromogenic
IHC.
To further explore the association between the mutational load
and tumor inflammation, we analyzed the NSCLC cases from the
TCGA collection. As shown in Supplementary Figure 9, the
mutational load was only marginally correlated with the level of
adaptive immunity transcripts in lung adenocarcinomas includ-
ing CD8A, CXCL10, GZMB, IFNG, and STAT1 (Spearman’s R =
0.14–0.3) and there was no relationship with other TIL markers
such as CD3, CD4, PRF1 and MS4A1 (Spearman’s R =
−0.08–0.006, Supplementary Figure 9A). Consistent with pre-
vious observations18,23, there was no association between the
mutational load and the adaptive immunity markers in lung
squamous cell carcinomas (Spearman’s R = −0.03–0.18, Supple-
mentary Figure 9B).
Discussion
Using whole exome DNA sequencing and multiplexed quantita-
tive TIL immunoprofiling we show that the tumor mutational
load and candidate class-I neoantigens are significantly associated
with durable responses to immune checkpoint blockers, but not
with T-cell tumor infiltration, TIL function and overall survival in
NSCLC. In addition, we identified a TIL signature in pre-
treatment tumor samples characterized by a dormant phenotype
(i.e., high CD3+/low GZB/low Ki-67) that is associated with
survival benefit to immune checkpoint blockers independent
from the tumor mutational load and PD-L1 expression.
Our results are consistent with previous studies showing a
significant association between the mutational load or predicted
MHC class-I neoantigens and response to immune checkpoint
blockers13–17. However, our data indicate that this association is
not very strong (78.9% sensitivity and 66.6% specificity) and may
not translate into improved overall survival. The biological
determinants of this apparent contradiction are uncertain, but
could be related to the observation that patients with elevated
tumor mutations tend to be smokers who more commonly dis-
play poorer health with prominent co-morbidity. In addition,
genomically unstable lung tumors may adapt faster to immune
pressure imposed by checkpoint blockade than tumors with low
mutational burden. In support of this notion, we found no sig-
nificant association between the mutational load and the level of
tumor T-cell infiltration or lymphocyte activation/proliferation
suggesting that advanced mutation/neoantigen-rich lung carci-
nomas are equipped with potent immune suppressive mechan-
isms. Alternatively, we should consider the possibility that mutant
neopeptides are only one component of the immunogenic drivers
in lung cancer and other mechanisms could also be involved in
the anti-tumor effects of immune checkpoint blockers. For
instance, aberrant expression of proteins or peptides with specific
post-translational modifications detected in cancer (e.g., phos-
phorylation, acetylation, and citrullination) have been shown to
trigger CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses26–30. Supporting this
possibility, the estimated mutational/neoantigen load was not
clearly associated with anti-tumor immunity in bladder urothelial
carcinomas treated with the anti PD-L1 drug atezolizumab31 and
with response to PD-1 blockade in melanoma14. Additional
mechanisms for tumor immune recognition may also have a role
in these effects, including cytosolic responses to DNA damage,
altered/foreign nucleic acids or cell stress32,33. Distinct genomic

 mutational patterns (e.g., tobacco mutagen signature), microbial/
viral exposures, and unique immune features of lung cancer could
explain the differences with a previous study in colorectal
carcinomas showing association between the mutational load,
predicted neoantigens and local lymphocyte responses34. How-
ever, and consistent with our results, this study found that the
neoantigen load was associated with CD45RO+ cells, but not
with CD3+ T-cells and CD8+ cytotoxic cell density34. Larger
studies carefully studying the genomic landscape and immune
contexture in lung cancer using localized protein measurements
will be required to clarify this point.
Recent publications have suggested the use of the tumor
mutational load and candidate neoantigen content as predictive
biomarkers for immune checkpoint blockers and for identifica-
tion of personalized targets for development of peptide/nucleic
acid vaccines and adoptive cell therapies15,35,36. Although diverse
studies interrogating class-I neoantigens in human malignancies
have used similar methods (e.g., whole exome DNA sequencing

accepted approach. Refinement of relevant neoantigen identifi-
cation incorporating the mutant allelic frequency/clonality18,
expression levels of the mutant transcripts37 and functional assays
to detect antigen specific cells, T-cell peptide recognition or
binding of the mutant peptides to HLA-proteins have been
proposed12,18–21,38. Unfortunately, these approaches require the
use of sophisticated technical/bioinformatic resources and studies
directly comparing their performance using clinical endpoints are
lacking. In addition, most available strategies to predict and/or
validate neoantigens rely on the particular patient HLA-types.

In melanoma patients, naive peripheral blood T-cells obtained
from healthy donors were able to recognize mutant neoantigens
in HLA-matched patients with melanoma that were neglected by
the autologous patient T-cells38. This indicates a complex reg-

 endpoint for demonstrating the immunogenic capacity of pre-
dicted neoepitopes.
In our study, we used a pipeline to identify candidate class-I
neoantigens based on their predicted affinity with patient-
matched HLA-proteins and recognition by the T-cell receptor.
In addition, we validated the strategy using an in vitro assay to
detect HLA membrane stabilization upon challenging immune-
selected lymphoblastoma cells with the recombinant mutant
peptides. We also demonstrated T-cell reactivity against the
mutant neoepitopes identified in a NSCLC using cultured lym-
phocytes extracted from peripheral blood of the same patient.
Our preliminary results indicate that nearly 2/3 of candidate
neoantigens predicted in the background of a patient with
HLA*A2 type can effectively bind the HLA-proteins. However,
the establishment of assays and evaluation of performance of
predicted neopeptides in cases with other HLA-alleles that are less
common or not well studied is uncertain and will require further
development.
The nonsynonymous mutational load and predicted class-I
neoantigen content in our study were similar to a previous report
including 34 advanced NSCLC cases treated with PD-1 blocking
antibodies (median of 256 vs 200 nonsynonymous mutations per
genome; and 72 vs 112 candidate class-I neoantigens per
tumor13). Our results are also similar to other studies using
TCGA sequencing data from NSCLC23,24. Minor differences with
previous reports are likely due to dissimilar approaches used for
the variant calling and filtering. Our study also included 13 cases
without available paired germline DNA in which the mutation
load was established using tumor exome sequencing and refer-
ence libraries. Notably, the mutation load and candidate MHC
class-I neoantigen content were comparable between cases with
and without paired germline DNA and the association between
mutations, neoantigens and response/survival was comparable
when unpaired cases were excluded from the analysis (Figure 10).
The latter confirms the robustness of the mutation analysis and
indicates that the presence of cases with unpaired DNA did not
impact the results.
Diverse metrics of tumor immune infiltration including the
amount of CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells or RNA signatures of T-
effector cells have been linked with clinical benefit to CTLA-4 and
PD-1 axis blockers1,11,12,17,31. Our results using spatially resolved
QIF measurements expand these observations and demonstrate a
prominent role of pre-existing CD3+ TILs in the anti-tumor
effect induced by immune checkpoint blockers in lung cancer.
Additional studies are ongoing to clearly define the subpopulation
of lymphocytes mediating these responses (e.g., specific CD4+ vs
CD8+ subpopulations, expression of additional targets).
We studied two cohorts of patients with NSCLC and found
limited correlation between the T-cell signal and the level of
T-cell cytolytic potential/proliferation, confirming independence
of the markers. Notably, a “dormant” T-cell phenotype char-
acterized by elevated T-cells with low activation and proliferation
markers in the tumor bed was significantly associated with longer
survival only in the cohort of patients treated with immune
checkpoint blockers. This finding is consistent with a recent
report in melanoma showing that pre-treatment tumor samples
with an exhausted CD8+ TIL phenotype characterized by
high PD-1/CTLA-4 and low IL-2 and TNF-α was predictive
of response to PD-1 blockade39. However, measurement of this
T-cell signature using multi-color flow cytometry requires
extraction of lymphocytes from fresh tumor tissue and in vitro
stimulation with PMA and ionomycin. Our TIL signature
was validated and standardized for use in conventional biopsy
(e.g., FFPE) tissue and does not require any specific tissue
processing or treatment. Therefore, it can be applied to archive
biopsy tissue and could be easily translated into a clinical
environment. Prospective validation and optimization of the
QIF-based signature is ongoing and will require maturation of
the cohort to evaluate the effect on long-term survival.
A rather unexpected finding was the lack of prominent benefit
from immune checkpoint therapies in patients with tumors
containing predominantly elevated T-cells with high effector
markers and proliferation. One possible explanation for this is
the limited potential for additional activation of this TIL popu-
lation and the existence of alternative local immune suppression
pathways in tumors with effective antigen recognition, activation
and T-cell migration. In this regard, diverse mechanisms have
been proposed to be used by tumors to block the T-cell attack
including collagen deposition around tumor cells40, exacerbated
lysosome
secretion
and
perforin
degradation
at
the
lytic
synapse41, cytotoxic T-cell trapping in specific tissue compart-
ments42 and metabolic alterations of T-cells43.
To further support the role of PD-1 blockade in stimulating
“dormant” TILs, we could experimentally increase the cytolytic
activity and proliferation of extracted lymphocytes after treatment
with a PD-1 blocking antibody in a patient-derived xenograft
model. Interestingly, T-cell proliferation was more associated
with a CD4+/T-BET+ cell phenotype and production of GZB
was seen more frequently in CD8+/EOMES+ cells. A population
of CD3+ cells showed both proliferation and cytolytic activity
upon PD-1 blockade and was characterized by predominant
CD8 positivity with co-expression of T-BET, EOMES, TIM-3,
and HLA-DR. The latter indicate that different T-cell subsets
show differential response to PD-1 antibodies. A similar result
showing increased proliferation (e.g., “proliferative burst”) of
antigen specific CD8+/CXCR5+ cells with a distinct transcrip-
tional profile and lower levels of effector molecules was found in a
murine model of chronic LCMV infection44. Future studies
performing in-depth analyses of specific T-cell subpopulations
using different NSCLC variants and spanning various treatment
courses will be required to understand the dynamics of the
adaptive response induced by PD-1 blockade.
A limitation of our study is the use of a cohort of NSCLC
patients treated with different immune checkpoint blockers.
Although all cases received PD-1 axis inhibitors, seven cases were
additionally treated with concurrent CTLA-4 blockade. To date,
most available data indicate that treatment with PD-1 axis inhi-
bitors targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 produce comparable effects in
NSCLC1–4. Other limitations of our study include heterogeneity
of tumor sites analyzed and variable time points of tumor col-
lection. Indeed, 59% of tumor specimens in the cohort were
collected prior to other intervening anti-cancer systemic therapies
and the median time from collection to initiation of immu-
notherapy was 9 months. Although the optimal time window or
tumor site to reliably measure predictive immune-related bio-
markers in lung cancer specimens has not been determined, our
results suggest that key biological information is present in
archived FFPE tumor specimens from varying sites not imme-
diately preceding immune checkpoint blockade. Future studies
analyzing prospectively collected samples and large cohorts will
be required to clarify possible differences and their implications.
In summary, we have identified a TIL signature characterized
by “dormant” or inactive TILs that is strongly associated with
clinical benefit to immune checkpoint blockers in NSCLC
patients and is independent from the tumor mutational load
and PD-L1 expression. Additional studies will be required to
determine the value of this signature as a clinical biomarker.
Methods
Cases and samples. We studied 49 pre-treatment FFPE samples from NSCLC
patients who initiated immune checkpoint blockers between 2009 and 2014 at
our institution. Cases were obtained from Yale Pathology archive and

 clinico-pathological information was extracted from the clinical records. Detailed
description of the cohort is shown in the Supplementary Table 2. Twenty-nine
cases were treated with PD-1 antibody monotherapy (nivolumab/pembrolizumab),
12 cases with PD-L1 antibody (atezolizumab), seven cases with dual PD-1/CTLA-4
blockade (nivolumab/ipilimumab or durvalumab/tremelimumab) and one case
with concurrent nivolumab and erlotinib after progression on erlotinib alone. For
the analyses and as previously reported13, cases showing partial or complete
response by RECIST v1.1 lasting >24 weeks or stable disease lasting >24 weeks were
considered as having durable clinical benefit (DCB). Cases showing progression of
disease or stable disease lasting equal or less than 24 weeks were considered as
showing no durable benefit (NDB).
A retrospective collection containing 110 NSCLCs not treated with
immunotherapy and represented in TMA format was also included. Cases in
TMAs were evaluated in 2-fold redundancy and using two independent blocks
including cores from different tumor areas. Therefore, the results presented
included integrated data from 2 to 4 independent tumor cores stained at least twice.
Detailed description of this cohort is provided in the Supplementary Table 3.
TMAs were prepared using 0.6 mm cores, each in 2-fold redundancy using
standard procedures. Informed consent was obtained from the subjects and
samples were used after approval from the Yale Human Investigation Committee
protocols #9505008219, #0304025173, #1603017333, and #1412015109.
Whole exome sequencing and mutational analysis. Genomic DNA from tumor
and normal samples was captured on the Nimblegen 2.1M human exome array and
DNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2500 instrument using 74-bp
paired-end reads. Sequence reads were mapped to the human b37 reference gen-
ome using the Burrow-Wheeler Aligner-MEM (BWA-MEM)45 program and
mutation calling was performed with GATK following the Best Practices guide-
lines. For matched tumor-normal pairs, somatic point mutations and indels were
called by MuTect2 using Bayesian classifiers. For unmatched tumor samples,
MuTect2 compared the tumor to the reference panel of normal samples of the
same ethnicity. For all somatic mutations called, the mutations that were supported
by at least two alternative non-reference alleles present in more than 5% of all
sequencing reads or a total of eight independent reads were considered. Identified
variants were further filtered based on their presence in repositories of common
variations (1000 Genomes, NHLBI exome variant server and 2577 non-cancer
exomes sequenced at Yale) and annotated using ANNOVAR46. For all matched
samples, somatic CNVs were analyzed using EXCAVATOR47 that normalizes the
non-uniform whole-exome sequencing read depths taking GC-content, mapp-
ability, and exon-size into account and calculates the ratio of normalized read
depth between tumor and normal for the exome capture intervals. LOH calling and
purity estimation were performed as previously described48.
HLA typing and class-I/II neoantigen prediction. The 4-digit patient-specific
HLA class I type was determined by ATHLATES in silico49. All nonsynonymous
somatic mutations identified from the whole exome sequencing analysis were
translated into 17-mer polypeptides flanking the mutant amino acid. The binding
affinity of mutant nonamers to the patient-specific HLA class I type was predicted
using NetMHCcons algorithms, as previously reported13,16,17,23. Nonamers with
IC50 below or equal to 500 nM were further tested for the recognition by the T-cell
receptor using Class I immunogenicity25 resulting in putative neoantigens.
Candidate MHC class-I neoantigens with calculated IC50 ≦ 50 nM were considered
as high affinity binders, those with calculated IC50 between 50 ≦ 150 nM)
were considered as intermediate binders and sequences with calculated IC50 >
150 ≦ 500 nM were considered as weak buinders. HLA class II type for each patient
was estimated using the PHLAT algorithm. 53-mer polypeptides were identified by
the in-house script with the nonsynonymous somatic mutation in the middle at
position 27. The binding affinity of 53-mer polypeptides to the patient-specific
HLA class II type was calculated by NetMHCIIpan-3.0.
In vitro HLA-A2 stabilization assay. Experimental validation of the HLA binding
capacity of in silico predicted class-I mutant neoantigenic peptides identified in
NSCLC was performed by measuring the stabilization of HLA-A2 protein after
incubation of B-lymphoblastoid LCL-174 cells with recombinant mutant 9-mer
peptides. LCL-174 cells (available in the laboratory of Dr. Paula Kavathas, Yale
University) are irradiated and immuno-selected human cells having specific dele-
tions and lacking MHC-II genes and TAP proteins; and expressing only HLA-A2,
-C1, and -B5 protein50. Cells were incubated overnight with 50 μM recombinant 9-
mer mutant peptides found in the tumor sample of patient YLR029 and stained for
HLA-A2 protein using a fluorescently labeled primary antibody by flow cytometry.
Peptides inducing surface HLA-A2 signal above the negative control sample were
considered as positive binders. Cell lines used in this study were authenticated
every 3–6 months using the GenePrint® 10 System in the Yale University DNA
Analysis Facility. Cells were also periodically tested for mycoplasma
contamination.
In vitro expansion of neoantigen specific T-cells and flow cytometry. PBMC
were isolated from the lung cancer patient YLR029. Fourteen putative neoantigens
predicted to bind A*02:01 HLA-I allele with binding affinities from 10–414 nM
were synthesized and divided into two pools of eight (peptide pool #1 [TMOD4,
TENM2, MDM2, NXPE1, RHOT2(A), RHOT2(I), KIF5A, ARHGAP9]) or six
peptides (peptide pool #2 [GCN1L1, TBXAS1, GRIN3A, HSF1, CSGALNACT2,
DUSP10]). In vitro expansion of CD8 T cells specific to the two peptide pools
was performed using a protocol adapted from Greenberg et al.51, with some
modifications. Briefly, autologous monocytes (adherent cells) were isolated from
PBMC using the CD14 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Monocytes were
differentiated into dendritic cells (DCs) by IL-4 (25 ng/ml) and GMCSF
(100 ng/ml) treatment for 7 days. The DCs were further matured by stimulation
with lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 10 ng/ml) for 16 h. During the last 4 h of LPS
stimulation, DCs were pulsed with 5 nM of the peptide pools and were
subsequently co-cultured with lymphocytes. IL-7 (25 ng/ml) was added on the
first day of co-culture and IL-2/IL-15 (100 U/ml/25 ng/ml) was added on days 2
and 5. After seven days of this initial co-culture, cells (mainly non-adherent
lymphocytes) were stimulated and co-cultured with an artificial APC (K562-HLA-
A2+, 4–1BBL+) pulsed with appropriate peptides pools (5 nM for 3 h.), irradiated
(45 Gy), and mixed at 1:2 effector cell: APC ratio. IL-7 was added on the first day
and IL-2/IL-15 was added on the second and the fifth day. At the end of this seven-
day period, flow cytometry/intracellular cytokine staining assay was performed as
previously described52. Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were stimulated with the K562 artificial
APC (106 cells) that was pulsed either with pool #1, pool #2, or no peptide. After
30 min, brefeldin A (BioLegend) was added to the culture and stimulation con-
tinued for another 5.5 h. Then, the cells were stained with a viability dye (Invi-
trogen), as well as with anti-CD3-Percp Cy5.5, anti-CD4-PE, and anti-CD8-APC-
Cy7 (BioLegend). Afterwards, the cells were permeabilized and stained with anti-
IFN-γ-Pacific Blue and anti-TNF-α-FITC (BioLegend). At least 90,000 total events
were acquired on an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Immunocytometry Systems) and
data were analyzed using FlowJo software (version 10.2; Tree Star Inc.).
DNA and RNA sequencing analysis from TCGA dataset. We analyzed gene
expression and somatic mutation for 514 lung adenocarcinomas and 504 lung
squamous cell carcinomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA).
Somatic mutational load was calculated as total number of mutations identified in
each tumor sample. Normalized gene expression of tumor was downloaded from
TCGA data portal and further analyzed to correct for batch effects using the MD
Anderson GDAC’s MBatch website (http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/
tcgabatcheffects). Spearman’s rank correlations were then calculated between the
somatic mutational load and normalized expression levels of 9 immune-related
genes using 464 LUAD and 178 LUSC samples that have both somatic mutation
and gene expression data.
Immunohistochemistry. PD-L1 IHC was stained using the FDA-approved PD-L1
IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit on the Dako Link 48 platform according to manufacturer
recommendations using 4–5 μm thick whole tissue histology tumor preparations.
The 22C3 antibody in this kit is provided already diluted at an unspecified
ratio, was stained in the CLIA laboratory of the Department of Pathology at Yale
University and scored by a trained pathologist using bright field microscopy
and a semi-quantitative score. Values were expressed as percentage of tumor cells
displaying predominant membrane signal.
Multiplexed QIF. The multiplexed TIL staining protocol was performed using 5-
color multiplex fluorescence with simultaneous detection of markers labeled using
isotype specific antibodies as previously described by our group53. Briefly, histology
sections from the cases were deparaffinized and subjected to antigen retrieval using
EDTA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) pH = 8.0 and boiled for 20 min at 97 °C in a
pressure-boiling container (PT module, Lab Vision). Slides were then incubated
with dual endogenous peroxidase block (DAKO #S2003) for 10 min at room
temperature and subsequently with a blocking solution containing 0.3% bovine
serum albumin in 0.05% Tween solution for 30 min. Slides were stained with 4′,6-
Diamidino-2-Phenylindole (DAPI) for visualization of all cells, CK to detect tumor
epithelial cells, CD3 for T-lymphocytes, GZB for T-cell cytolytic potential and Ki-
67 as cell proliferation marker. Primary antibodies included CK clone AE1/AE3
(catalogue # M3515) from DAKO used with a concentration of 0.12 mg/ml, CD3
clone SP7 (catalogue # NB600-1441) from Novus biologicals dilution 1:100 (culture
supernatant), GZB clone 4E6 (catalogue # ab139354) from Abcam with a con-
centration of 5 μg/ml and Ki-67 clone MIB1 (catalogue # M724029-2) from DAKO
with a concentration of 0.46 μg/ml. Secondary antibodies and fluorescent reagents
used were goat anti-rabbit Alexa546 (Invitrogen; 1:100 dilution), anti-rabbit
Envision (K4009, DAKO, 1:100 stock dilution) with biotynilated tyramide/Strep-
tavidine-Alexa750 conjugate (Perkin-Elmer); anti-mouse IgG1 antibody
(eBioscience) with fluorescein-tyramide (Perkin-Elmer), anti-mouse IgG2a anti-
body (Abcam) with Cy5-tyramide (Perkin-Elmer). Residual horseradish peroxidase
activity between incubations with secondary antibodies was eliminated by exposing
the slides twice for 7 min to a solution containing benzoic hydrazide (0.136 mg)
and hydrogen peroxide (50 µl).
Tissue fluorescence measurement and scoring. Quantitative measurement of
the fluorescent signal was performed using the AQUA® method that enables
objective measurement of targets within user-defined tissue compartments9,52.

 Briefly, the QIF score of each target in CD3+ T-cell compartment was calculated
by dividing the target pixel intensities by the area of CD3 positivity in the sample.
Scores were normalized to the exposure time and bit depth at which the
images were captured, allowing scores collected at different exposure times to be
comparable. Stained slides were visually examined by a pathologist and defective
samples or areas with staining artifacts were re-analyzed or excluded.
Patient-derived xenograft model. Briefly, surgical specimens (10 mm2) from
primary lung carcinomas were divided in 2 halves. A portion of each half was used
for morphology studies and most of the tissue was implanted subcutaneously into
the flank of NOD-scid IL2rgc−/− male mice. Mice were treated intraperitoneally
with anti-hPD-1 mAbs (clone M3) or PBS at days 5 and 10. At day 12 mice were
sacrificed and tumors were collected for analysis. All institutional and national
guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals were followed.
Cell preparation and mass cytometry (CyTOF) analysis. Tumors were minced
and mechanically dissociated with the GentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec)
in the presence of RPMI1640 with 0.5% BSA and 5 mM EDTA. The resulting
cell suspension was filtered using a 70-μm cell strainer (BD Falcon). Cells were
centrifuged at 600 g for 7 min at 4 °C and re-suspended in PBS with 0.5% BSA
and 0.02% NaN3. 2 × 106 cells from each tumor were incubated with antibodies
against CD16/32 at 50 μg/ml in a total volume of 50 μl for 10 min at RT to block
Fc receptors. Surface marker antibodies were then added, yielding 100 μL final
reaction volume and stained for 30 min at 4 °C. Following staining, cells were
washed twice with PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.02% NaN3. Then, cells were re-
suspended with RPMI1640 and 10 μM Cisplatin (Fluidigm Corp) in a total
volume of 400 μl for 1 min before quenching 1:1 with pure FBS to determine
viability. Cells were centrifuged at 600 g for 7 min at 4 °C and washed once
with PBS with 0.5% BSA and 0.02% NaN3. Cells were then fixed using Fixation/
Permeabilization Buffer (ebioscience) for 30 min at 4 °C. After two washes with
Perm buffer (ebioscience) cells were incubated with intracellular antibodies cocktail
in 100 μl for 30 min at 4 °C. A summary of the antibodies/clones used in the mass
cytometry analyses is presented in the Supplementary Table 4. Cells were
washed twice in PBS with 0.5% BSA and 0.02% NaN3 and then stained with 1 mL
of 1:4000 191/193Ir DNA intercalator (Fluidigm) diluted in PBS with 1.6% PFA
overnight. Cells were then washed once with PBS with 0.5% BSA and 0.02%
NaN3 and then two times with double-deionized (dd)H2O. Mass cytometry
samples were diluted in ddH2O containing bead standards to approximately 106
cells per mL and then analyzed on a CyTOF 2 mass cytometer (Fluidigm). All files
were normalized together using the mass-cytometry data normalization algo-
rithm54 and analyzed using viSNE.
Statistical analyses. Mutational data and QIF signals were analyzed using
Spearman’s Rho rank regression functions. Case data and characteristics were
compared using non-parametric t-test for continuous variables and chi-square or
Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Overall survival functions were com-
pared using Kaplan–Meier estimates and statistical significance was determined
using the log-rank test. The mutational load, candidate class-I neoantigen content
and TIL markers were stratified using the median score. Statistical analyses were
performed using JMP® Pro software (version 11.0, SAS Institute Inc.) and
GraphPad Prism v6.0 (GraphPad Sofware, Inc).
