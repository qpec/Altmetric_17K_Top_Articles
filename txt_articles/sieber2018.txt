IMPORTANCE Postoperative delirium is the most common complication following major
surgery in older patients. Intraoperative sedation levels are a possible modifiable risk factor
for postoperative delirium.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether limiting sedation levels during spinal anesthesia reduces
incident delirium overall.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This double-blind randomized clinical trial (A Strategy to
Reduce the Incidence of Postoperative Delirum in Elderly Patients [STRIDE]) was conducted
from November 18, 2011, to May 19, 2016, at a single academic medical center and included a
consecutive sample of older patients (�65 years) who were undergoing nonelective hip
fracture repair with spinal anesthesia and propofol sedation. Patients were excluded for
preoperative delirium or severe dementia. Of 538 hip fractures screened, 225 patients
(41.8%) were eligible, 10 (1.9%) declined participation, 15 (2.8%) became ineligible between
the time of consent and surgery, and 200 (37.2%) were randomized. The follow-up included
postoperative days 1 to 5 or until hospital discharge.
INTERVENTIONS Heavier (modified observer’
s assessment of sedation score of 0-2) or lighter
(observer’
s assessment of sedation score of 3-5) propofol sedation levels intraoperatively.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Delirium on postoperative days 1 to 5 or until hospital
discharge determined via consensus panel using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision) criteria. The incidence of delirium was compared
between intervention groups with and without stratification by the Charlson comorbidity
index (CCI).
RESULTS Of 200 participants, the mean (SD) age was 82 (8) years, 146 (73%) were women,
194 (97%) were white, and the mean (SD) CCI was 1.5 (1.8). One hundred participants each
were randomized to receive lighter sedation levels or heavier sedation levels. A good
separation of intraoperative sedation levels was confirmed by multiple indices. The overall
incident delirium risk was 36.5% (n = 73) and 39% (n = 39) vs 34% (n = 34) in heavier and
lighter sedation groups, respectively (P = .46). Intention-to-treat analyses indicated no
statistically significant difference between groups in the risk of incident delirium (log-rank
test χ2, 0.46; P = .46). However, in a prespecified subgroup analysis, when stratified by CCI,
sedation levels did effect the delirium risk (P for interaction = .04); in low comorbid states
(CCI = 0), heavier vs lighter sedation levels doubled the risk of delirium (hazard ratio, 2.3;
95% CI, 1.1- 4.9). The level of sedation did not affect delirium risk with a CCI of more than 0.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In the primary analysis, limiting the level of sedation provided
no significant benefit in reducing incident delirium. However, in a prespecified subgroup
analysis, lighter sedation levels benefitted reducing postoperative delirium for persons with a
CCI of 0.

 P
ostoperative delirium (PD) is the most common com-
plication after major surgery in older patients without
cognitive impairment.1 Postoperative delirium carries
with it personal, social, and economic burdens.2 This compli-
cation, with its associated costs, will assume increasing im-
portance as the number of older patients in the US popula-
tion continues to grow.
The mainstay of delirium management is prevention by
control and/or elimination of modifiable risk factors. One such
risk factor may be sedative medications, as both drug selec-
tion and dosage can be modified. The role of sedative and an-
algesic medications as iatrogenic risk factors for delirium in in-
tensive care unit (ICU) and postsurgical patients is well
described.3-6 The evidence suggests that the level of sedation
varies substantially during surgery and that heavier sedation
levels that are consistent with general anesthesia are com-
monplace intraoperatively.7 Managing intraoperative seda-
tion may be an important modifiable risk factor; however, to
our knowledge, few studies have been done in this area.
To help explain the contribution of sedation levels to PD,
we undertook a randomized, 2-group, parallel superiority trial
called A Strategy to Reduce the Incidence of Postoperative De-
liriuminElderlyPatients(STRIDE).TheprimaryaimofSTRIDE
was to compare the effect of lighter and heavier intraopera-
tive propofol sedation levels on delirium incidence in older pa-
tients who were undergoing hip fracture repair. A secondary
objective was a prespecified subgroup analysis to determine
whether limiting sedation levels during spinal anesthesia re-
duces incident PD when stratified by baseline comorbidity.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
The research protocol was approved by the Johns Hopkins in-
stitutional review board (NA_00041873). The trial was regis-
tered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00590707) (Supplement 1). All
participants provided their written informed consent. STRIDE
was conducted at a single clinical center, and all intraoperative
management was provided by 4 anesthesiologists. A detailed
description of the trial protocol was published previously in
the supplemental material of Li et al.8
Patients who were 65 years or older who were undergo-
ing hip fracture repair with spinal anesthesia and propofol se-
dation and who did not have preoperative delirium or severe
dementia were randomized to receive either heavier (modi-
fied observer’
s assessment of alertness/sedation score [OAA/
S], 0-2) or lighter (OAA/S, 3–5) intraoperative sedation levels.9
An OAA/S range for each sedation level was felt to more accu-
rately reflect the clinical picture because exact OAA/S targets
cannot always be achieved. The inclusion criteria were (1) ad-
mission to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center for surgi-
cal repair of a traumatic hip fracture, (2) being age 65 years or
older, (3) a preoperative Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE) score of 15 or higher,10 and (4) receiving spinal anes-
thesia. The exclusion criteria included (1) receiving general an-
esthesia, (2) an inability to speak or understand English, (3) se-
verechronicobstructivepulmonarydiseaseorcongestiveheart
failure, (4) refusal to give informed consent, (5) a nonpartici-
pating attending surgeon, (6) hip fractures in both hips at the
same admission, (7) a repair of another fracture concurrently
with the hip fracture, (8) a prior hip surgery on the same hip
that would be repaired in the current surgery, and (9) preop-
erative delirium.
Outcomes
Patientswereassessedfordelirium,deliriumseverity,andcog-
nition preoperatively and on postoperative days 1 to 5 by re-
search personnel who were masked to the randomization as-
signment. The diagnosis of delirium was made by a
multidisciplinaryconsensuspanelbasedonDiagnosticandSta-
tistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) criteria
using several data sources, including the confusion assess-
ment method,11 the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS),12
digitspan,areviewofmedicalrecords,andfamily/nursingstaff
interviews. The primary outcome was the incidence of de-
lirium from postoperative day 1 to postoperative day 5 or hos-
pital discharge, whichever occurred first. The secondary out-
comes were MMSE scores and DRS severity and total scores
during the first 5 postoperative days or until hospital dis-
charge, whichever occurred first. The prespecified secondary
objective was to assess the interaction between baseline co-
morbidity and propofol sedation levels in determining de-
lirium incidence after hip fracture repair (see the protocol in
the supplemental material of Li et al8).
STRIDE was powered to detect a 48.0% risk reduction in
the primary outcome, PD in-hospital up to day 5 after sur-
gery, from 39.6% in the heavier sedation arm to 20.6% in
the lighter sedation arm with 80% power using a 2-sided
test with a type I error of 0.05 through a sample of 200 par-
ticipants in equal allocation who were randomly assigned to
the 2 study arms.8 These power assumptions were based on
our preliminary randomized clinical trial.13
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted with the intention-to-treat
principle. The incidence of delirium in the 2 intervention
groups was compared using the time-to-event analytic
approach. The cumulative incidence of PD was estimated by
a Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the between-group difference
Key Points
Question Does limiting sedation levels during hip fracture repair
under spinal anesthesia reduce postoperative delirium overall or
when stratified by baseline comorbidity?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 200 older
patients randomized to receive lighter vs heavier sedation, limiting
levels of sedation provided no significant overall benefit in
reducing incident delirium. However, in a prespecified subgroup
analysis, heavier vs lighter sedation levels doubled the risk of
postoperative delirium in patients with low baseline comorbidities
as defined by a Charlson comorbidity index score of 0.
Meaning Limiting intraoperative sedation levels may reduce
delirium in older patients with low baseline comorbidity.

 of incidence was compared with the log-rank test. The rela-
tive risk of PD between intervention groups was evaluated
with Cox proportional hazards models. The proportionality
assumption was verified using Schoenfeld residuals and a
proportionality test. The secondary outcomes included the
tracking of daily MMSE scores, DRS severity, and total
scores during the participant’
s hospital stay using a non-
parametric regression. Between-group comparisons were
conducted with mixed-effects linear models.8 The binary
outcome of PD that occurred in both intervention groups
was evaluated by a logistic regression. All of the modeling
approaches accounted for the age and MMSE score at base-
line that was used in stratified randomization. Our only pre-
planned subgroup analyses explored the heterogeneity of
intervention effects by stratifying the study groups accord-
ing to the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score.14 The CCI
score was not age corrected and was calculated as previ-
ously described,14 except that baseline a Clinical Dementia
Rating score of 1 or more defined dementia. The treatment
interaction with the CCI scores on the time-to-event out-
come was tested with a Cox proportional hazards model and
accounted for the covariates that were related to the out-
come and the CCI scores. Treatment-CCI interactions on the
binary outcome of PD were tested by a logistic regression
similarly. In these subgroup analyses, we treated the CCI
scores as categorical variables in exploratory analyses to
identify parsimonious effect modification models. We
tested them as a continuous variable that extended through
the full range of CCI scores and as a “truncated” variable
that combined all scores of 3 or more as more than 2. Base-
line characteristics that are associated with PD and CCI
scores were adjusted for in these effect modification mod-
els, in addition to baseline age and MMSE scores. All analy-
ses were conducted with SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
Figure 1 outlines the Consolidated Standards of Reporting dia-
gram for STRIDE. Of 538 patients with a hip fracture who were
screened from November 18, 2011, through May 19, 2016, 200
patients (37.2%) were randomized to receive either lighter or
heavier sedation levels. The most common reasons for ineli-
gibility were an age younger than 65 years (97 [18.0%]) and an
MMSE score of less than 15 (88 [16.4%]). Of 225 eligible pa-
tientswhowereapproachedtoprovideconsent,only10(4.4%)
declinedparticipation;15(6.7%)becameineligiblebetweenthe
time of consent and surgery.
Baseline Characteristics
Baseline demographics were similar in the 2 intervention
groups (Table 1). Forty-eight participants (24%) had any edu-
cation beyond high school. The baseline comorbidities, as as-
sessed by CCI scores, and functional status were well-
matched between the groups. Sixty-seven (33.5%) and 75
(37.5%) participants were capable of performing all physical
self-maintenance scale items and the instrumental activities
ofdailylivingitems,respectively.15One-hundredsixteen(58%)
had a smoking history, and 27 (13.5%) scored 2 or greater on
the CAGE16 alcoholism questionnaire.
The baseline cognitive testing results were comparable be-
tween intervention groups. A Geriatric Depression Scale score
of 6 or more occurred for 51 participants (25.5%),17 and 116
(58%) had a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5 or more.18
The mean (SD) MMSE score for all participants was 24 (4). The
type of fracture and surgical procedure, including the use of
cement, did not differ between intervention groups (Table 1).
Intervention
Intraoperatively, the separation between groups was good
(Table 2), as indicated by both modified OAA/S and EEG cri-
teria (Bispectral index; BIS Brain Monitoring System,
http://www.medtronic.com/covidien/products/brain-
monitoring). The sedation scores demonstrate a clinical dif-
ference between lighter (OAA/S ~ 4 represents a lethargic
response to calling a name in a normal tone) vs heavier
sedation levels (OAA/S ~ 0 occurs when the participant does
not respond to noxious stimuli). The bispectral index values
reflect the same clinical differences as the OAA/S scores. As
expected, the heavier sedation group received a higher total
propofol dose. No intraoperative narcotics or benzodiaz-
epines were administered to any patient. Patients in the
heavier sedation group had longer surgical times secondary
to prolonged awakening. Intraoperative mean arterial pres-
sure was lower in the heavier sedation group secondary to
the cardiovascular depressant effects of propofol. The over-
all level of spinal anesthesia was T9 ± 1.5 dermatomes. Most
blood transfusions occurred postoperatively within 72
hours, with only 4 patients (2%) receiving intraoperative
transfusions.
Patient Follow-up
Postoperative ICU admission rates, opioid consumption,
and pain scores were similar in the 2 intervention groups
(Table 2). All patients who were admitted to the ICU postop-
eratively had a 1-day length of stay. No patients in the ICU
required intubation. The postoperative length of stay and
hospital discharge location were comparable between inter-
vention groups. There was no difference between groups in
incidence or type of complications during the first 30 post-
operative days.
Effect of Intervention on Incident PD
Without adjusting for comorbidities, the incidence of a de-
lirium diagnosis at any time during postoperative days 1 to 5
was39%(n = 39)intheheaviersedationgroupand34%(n = 34)
in the lighter sedation group (P = .46, by χ2 analysis). The over-
all incidence was 36.5% (n = 73). Although we observed con-
sistently less PD in patients who received lighter sedation lev-
els, the difference between groups was not statistically
significant. An intention-to-treat analysis showed no statisti-
cal difference between groups in incident PD, total days of PD,
or total days of PD + subsyndromal symptoms (Figure 2). Sec-
ondary outcomes showed that DRS severity was higher and
MMSEscoreswerelowerintheheaviersedationgrouponpost-
operative day 1 (eFigure in Supplement 2).

 Interaction Between Comorbidity
and Intervention in Determining Incident PD
Incorporating a model that was adjusted for covariates that
were associated with PD in the literature19,20 and this data
set (age, MMSE score, fracture type, Geriatric Depression
Scale score) revealed significant interaction between seda-
tion levels and CCI in determining PD. Significant interac-
tions occurred in the time-to-event outcome in the form of
hazards ratios that were associated with the intervention
from the Cox regression models as well as the risk in the
binary outcome of ever receiving a diagnosis of PD
(Figure 3). In patients with a baseline CCI score of 0, heavier
sedation levels doubled the risk of PD (hazard ratio, 2.3;
95% CI, 1.1–4.9). In patients with higher baseline comorbid-
ity, as indicated by a CCI score of more than 0, the level of
sedation was not related to incident PD (eTables 1-4 in
Supplement 2).
Discussion
Theoverallintention-to-treatanalysis,withoutconsideringco-
morbidity,showednostatisticallysignificantbenefitsoflighter
sedation levels during hip fracture repair under spinal anes-
thesia.However,secondaryanalysesthatincorporatedthecon-
sideration of comorbidities suggested that this lack of overall
effect may be due to the heterogeneity of treatment effects
(HTE) that was associated with baseline comorbidity. Pre-
planned secondary analyses for HTE showed that comorbidi-
ties may modify the treatment effect of sedation levels on PD
risk in this older population with hip fracture. Lighter seda-
tion levels were associated with lower PD incidence, but the
differencefromtheheaviersedationgroupwasstatisticallysig-
nificant only in the subgroup with less comorbidity. At higher
levels of comorbidity, the benefit of lowering PD risk by lighter

can be an important decision in many patients as a means of
decreasing PD. However, the benefits of lighter sedation lev-
els may be overridden by baseline comorbidities.
The contribution of sedation depth to PD risk was exam-
ined in a previous randomized double-blind trial13 that used
electroencephalography criteria (bispectral index) to deter-
mine lighter or heavier sedation levels. In that study, lighter
sedation levels decreased the prevalence of PD by 50% com-
pared with heavier sedation levels. However, the bispectral in-
dexisnotroutinelyusedtomanagesedationbecauseofitspoor
correlation with sedation scores, particularly in ICU patients.21
Additionally,severalpatientsreceivedmultiplesedativeagents,
making the assessment of propofol-specific effects difficult.
Furthermore, the total propofol dose was greater in the lighter
sedation intervention arm of STRIDE than in the lighter seda-
tion intervention arm of the previous study (4.6 ± 2.3 vs
2.5 ± 2.7 mg/kg, respectively). Our propofol doses were higher,
having administered additional propofol to perform spinal an-
esthesia rather than other sedative agents to avoid any con-
founding effects. Although the exact propofol dosage that is
required to transition to delirium is unclear,4 in vulnerable
populations, propofol can precipitate delirium. Used as a seda-
tive in the ICU, propofol is associated with rapidly reversible
andpersistentdelirium.22Furthermore,hallucinationsandde-
lirium are reported after patients receive propofol doses simi-
lar to those administered in the STRIDE lighter sedation treat-
ment arm.23,24
The trial was not sufficiently powered to detect any inter-
vention effect that would allow a greater than 20.6% PD risk
in the lighter sedation arm. The small overall PD reduction that
was observed with lighter sedation levels is far from the level
that was hypothesized in the power calculation. However, the
hypothesizedstudypowerisnottotallyunfounded,asthelarg-

 est CCI subgroup, a CCI score of 0, exhibited effects from se-
dation depth that were similar to those in previous studies.13
The CCI score when treated as a continuous score modifies se-
dation depth effects on PD after adjusting for PD risk factors.
At a CCI score of 0, lighter sedation levels were protective. The
observation that higher CCI scores decreased the ability to pre-
vent PD by modifying the depth of sedation is consistent with
other studies that demonstrated that baseline vulnerabilities
are the important independent drivers behind the develop-
ment of PD.25 We previously reported that dementia is a strong
risk factor for PD in patients with hip fractures.26 The high
prevalenceofbaselinecognitivedysfunctionintheSTRIDEpar-
ticipants may have also influenced PD incidence, particularly
at higher CCI scores. In addition, at a higher CCI, the estimate
suggests a reverse situation in that heavier sedation levels
might be protective. However, the trend was not significant
and the estimate was unstable owing to small patient num-
bers at a high CCI. These factors limit our ability to investi-
gate the reason for this reversal of effects and warrant addi-
tional studies. Several hypothesis that generate analysis were
performed to elucidate the potential mechanisms that influ-
enced the CCI interaction and intervention effect. The demen-
tia CCI item alone did not predict PD after adjusting for base-
line risk factors. When the CCI cardiovascular items were
combined as a single score, there was significant interven-
tion effect modification by this combined vascular score and
risk of PD (χ2 = 4.07; P = .04), suggesting a cardiovascular
mechanism.
Strengths and Limitations
STRIDE is an efficacy trial that examined whether lighter seda-
tion levels produces clinically meaningful effects in reducing
PDincidenceinahigh-riskpopulation.Tobestanswerthisques-
tion, we controlled as many variables as possible. The STRIDE
study strengths include using propofol as the only interven-
tionaldrug.Thehighconsentratereducedselectionbias.Com-
pared with previous work, the methods were more rigorous.
Four anesthesiologists anesthetized and managed all STRIDE
cases in a consistent manner, and there were no protocol vio-
lations or group crossovers. Although a single-center study can
lead to a loss of generalizability, we believe that protocol con-
sistencyandtreatedassignmentadministrationoutweighedthis
weakness. Additionally, hip fracture demographics are charac-
terized by an older white female population.27 The STRIDE
population reflects these demographics and its PD prevalence
is consistent with recent multicenter trials.28-30 The periopera-
tivedeliriumassessmentwasdoneinasystematicmannerusing
standardized tools and a consensus panel. The randomization
produced an excellent matching of participants in the 2 inter-
vention groups. There were well-defined intraoperative differ-
ences in sedation levels between the intervention groups in
terms of the propofol dose, OAAS, and bispectral index. Fur-
thermore,biaswasminimizedinthedeliriumassessmentsand
diagnostic process via a masking of assessors and consensus
panel members to group assignments. The sample size was ad-
equate to detect significant clinical effects.
One study weakness was the limiting of delirium testing to
the first 5 postoperative days or until hospital discharge. Fol-
lowing hip fracture repair, the highest incidence of PD occurs
on postoperative day 1,30,31 as confirmed in Figure 2. Further-
more, delirium duration in STRIDE was comparable with other
studies that examined longer follow-up periods.32 Although
some observations were cut short because of death, return to
the operating room, or withdrawal, observations are available
on every participant. Because most PD cases occurred on days
1 and 2 and the time-to-event approach treats the small num-
bers of observations that were cut short as censoring, the po-
tential effect on our results would be minimal. Therefore, al-

 though statistical inaccuracy due to a shorter follow-up in
STRIDE cannot be completely ruled out, the likelihood of inac-
curacy is small. We did not measure delirium subtypes, which
could represent an unintended consequence of the interven-
tion. Only patients who could safely undergo spinal anesthe-
sia were included. Although the study results cannot necessar-
ilybegeneralizedtoallhipfracturepatients,intheUnitedStates
approximately40%ofallhipfracturerepairsareperformedwith
spinal anesthesia.26 The study results may not hold with anes-
theticagentsotherthanpropofol.However,propofolisthemost
widely used drug for sedation. The STRIDE participants could
reflectahealthierstudypopulation.However,themeanSTRIDE
CCI score33 and distribution of CCI scores were consistent with
theliterature.34Severalcomorbiditiesthatwereincludedinthe
CCI calculation are associated with underlying cognitive
dysfunction,35-37 but our multivariant analysis controlled for
baseline MMSE scores. Because CCI is not a complete surro-
gate measure for baseline risk factors of delirium, the model-
ing results may have been limited. A prespecified subgroup
analysis to look for HTE must be interpreted carefully. Hetero-
geneity and comorbidity in this population may have limited
ourabilitytodetectsignificantoveralleffects.However,hetero-
geneity is the expected clinical norm, and when assessing for
the interaction with comorbidity, we did find significant treat-
ment effects in the low-comorbidity subgroup. Besides in-
hospital PD outcomes, it is important to determine the inter-
ventioneffectsonlong-termfunctionalandcognitiveoutcomes.
These data are in the process of analysis and will be reported in
a separate article.
Conclusions
In a subgroup analysis, the STRIDE results suggest that PD
can be reduced in individuals with a CCI score of 0 by
reducing sedation levels. The STRIDE trial suggests that the
selection of sedation levels can be an important means of
decreasing PD in many patients. However, the associated
benefits of lighter sedation levels may be obscured by com-
peting baseline comorbidities, placing patients at risk of
developing PD. Given the STRIDE trial findings, the chal-
lenge for future research will be to determine the mecha-
nisms and interactional relationships between comorbidi-
ties and precipitating risk factors for PD.
