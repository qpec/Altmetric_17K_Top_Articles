 Abstract
Importance: Patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer have to decide among treatment 
strategies that may differ in their likelihood of adverse effects.
Objective: To compare quality of life (QOL) after radical prostatectomy, external beam 
radiotherapy and brachytherapy vs. active surveillance.
Design/Setting/Participants: Population-based prospective cohort of 1,141 men with newly-
diagnosed prostate cancer were enrolled from January 2011 through June 2013 in collaboration 
with the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry (Rapid Case Ascertainment). 57% of eligible 
men enrolled. Median time from diagnosis to enrollment was 5 weeks, and all men were enrolled 
with written informed consent prior to treatment. Final follow-up date for current analysis was 
September 9, 2015.
Exposure: Treatment – radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, or 
active surveillance.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Quality of life using the validated instrument Prostate Cancer 
Symptom Indices was assessed at baseline (pre-treatment), and 3, 12, 24 months after treatment. 
The instrument contains 4 domains – sexual dysfunction, urinary obstruction and irritation, urinary 
incontinence, and bowel problems – each scored from 0 (no dysfunction) to 100 (maximum 
dysfunction). Propensity-weighted mean domain scores were compared between each treatment 
group vs. active surveillance at each time point.
Results: 314 men pursued active surveillance (27.5%), 249 external beam radiotherapy (21.8%), 
109 brachytherapy (9.6%), and 469 radical prostatectomy (41.1%). After propensity weighting, 
median age was 66-67 years across groups, and 77-80% were white. Propensity-weighted baseline 
sexual dysfunction scores were 41.8-46.4 across groups, urinary obstruction and irritation 
20.8-22.8, urinary incontinence 9.7-10.5, and bowel problems 5.7-6.1. Compared to active 
surveillance, mean sexual dysfunction scores worsened by 3 months for radical prostatectomy 
(+36.2 points, 95% CI 30.4-42.0), external beam radiotherapy (+13.9, 95% CI 6.7-21.2) and 
brachytherapy (+17.1, 95% CI 7.8-26.6) patients. Brachytherapy (+20.5 vs. active surveillance, 
95% CI 15.1-25.9) and external beam radiotherapy (+11.7, 95% CI 8.7-14.8) were associated with 
acute worsening of urinary obstruction and irritation, radical prostatectomy (+33.6, 95% CI 
27.8-39.2) with urinary incontinence, and external beam radiotherapy (+4.9, 95% CI 2.4-7.4) 
bowel symptoms. By 24 months, mean scores between treatment groups vs. active surveillance 
were not significantly different in most domains.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort of men with localized prostate cancer, each 
treatment strategy was associated with distinct patterns of adverse effects over 2 years. These 
findings should be used to promote treatment decisions that incorporate individual preferences.

 Introduction
The comparative effectiveness of contemporary treatment options for localized prostate 
cancer is one of the highest priority research questions according to the Institute of 
Medicine.1 Because prostate cancer patients often have extended life expectancy, the quality 
of life (QOL) effects of different treatment options is a central consideration for many men 
in their decision-making process.
Since the mid-2000’s, technologic advances in surgical and radiation treatments – e.g. 
robotic prostatectomy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy – have been rapidly 
disseminated in clinical practice.2,3 These new technologies were developed with a primary 
purpose to reduce treatment-related morbidity rather than improve cure. Studies showed that 
surgery and radiotherapy can cause sexual, urinary and bowel dysfunction;4 however, it is 
unclear whether contemporary technologies cause the same magnitude of problems. In 
addition, with increasing recognition that many patients may not need treatment 
immediately, active surveillance is now a standard option5 which preserves QOL for an 
unknown period of time for each man, until treatment is needed at the time of cancer 
progression.
The North Carolina Prostate cancer Comparative Effectiveness & Survivorship Study (NC 
ProCESS) is a population-based, observational cohort of men with newly-diagnosed prostate 
cancer – who were all enrolled prior to treatment and followed prospectively. The purpose of 
this study was to analyze QOL changes from baseline (pre-treatment) through 2 years after 
treatment for men who received radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy (RT), or 
brachytherapy vs. those who pursued active surveillance.
Methods
This study was approved by the University of North Carolina Institution Review Board. 
Patients were recruited in collaboration with the Rapid Case Ascertainment system of the 
North Carolina Central Cancer Registry (NCCCR). All participants signed written informed 
consent. The NCCCR achieves the highest North American Association of Central Cancer 
Registries standard for complete and accurate cancer incidence data (gold certificate), with 
>95% data completeness and 100% error-free data on cancer type, sex, race and age. 
NCCCR does not collect data on adverse effects. Rapid case ascertainment is an accelerated 
incident reporting process where registry staff proactively obtains information regarding 
tumors relevant to the study from local hospitals/facilities throughout all 100 counties of the 
State. This system allowed completion of baseline survey a median of 5 weeks after 
diagnosis.
Data collection
Demographics – age, race, insurance, education, household income, marital status – were 
assessed by patient report on baseline survey. Treatments received and dates were 
determined by medical record abstraction; if medical record was unavailable, then cancer 
registry data were used. Because the primary goal of this study was to inform patients’ initial 
treatment decision-making, treatment group assignment for data analysis was based on the

 initial treatment received; e.g. men who first received a prostatectomy and subsequently 
received an additional salvage treatment were categorized in the prostatectomy group. 
Active surveillance was defined with medical records stating this as the plan.
Outcomes
QOL was assessed using the validated Prostate Cancer Symptom Indices (PCSI);6 all 
surveys were conducted by telephone similar to prior methodology,7 at baseline (pre-
treatment), and 3, 12, 24 months after the treatment date. For active surveillance, an anchor 
date was assigned as 3 months after diagnosis for purposes of calculating subsequent survey 
dates. Each participant at each time point was called up to 10 times over a 3 week period 
(including evening and weekend times) to maximize response. Date of the last survey used 
in the current analysis was September 9, 2015.
The PCSI has 4 domains: urinary obstruction and irritation (5 items), urinary incontinence (3 
items), sexual dysfunction (5 items), and bowel problems (6 items). Each domain is scored 
from 0 to 100, with higher score indicating more/worse dysfunction. Minimal clinically 
important differences for PCSI domains have not been defined. Parallel to each of the 4 
domains are additional questions which ask patients about the magnitude of bother related to 
urinary obstruction and irritation, urinary incontinence, sexual and bowel symptoms. In 
addition to numerical scoring for each domain described above, the PCSI has established 
functional levels (normal, intermediate, and poor) that incorporate the symptom as well as 
bother questions8,9 – which complement the score reporting because QOL score changes are 
well-recognized to be difficult for patients and physicians to interpret.10 Normal function 
describes a patient with essentially no dysfunction or distress in a domain.11,12 For example, 
normal function in the urinary incontinence domain describes a man who has full urinary 
control without incontinence. Intermediate function describes a patient with at least one 
distressful symptom but none very distressful. For example, intermediate urinary 
incontinence represents leaking only at certain times, and no more than a few drops. Poor 
function describes patients with at least one very distressful symptom. For example, poor 
sexual function represents no erections capable of intercourse, or a lot of difficulty getting 
and keeping an erection. This classification adds clinical meaning to numerical scores, and 
also allowed analysis of QOL outcomes stratified by each participant’s baseline level.9 Prior 
work showed that effect sizes between functional levels of the PCSI are large.9,12
Data analysis
To adjust for potentially important differences in baseline characteristics across cohorts, 
propensity scores (PS) were estimated separately for each of the three treatment types (RT, 
brachytherapy, and prostatectomy) versus active surveillance. Specifically, PS were obtained 
from the predicted probabilities in separate logistic regression models contrasting active 
surveillance against each of the three treatment types. Variables included in the regression 
models included race, insurance, marital status, education, income, year of diagnosis, age at 
diagnosis, and baseline SF-12 and PCSI domain scores. Using the PS, all patients in the 
three treatment groups were assigned weights from their PS odds [PS/(1-PS)] whereas 
patients in active surveillance each received a weight of 1.15 This methodology balances the 
observed covariate distribution between the treatment groups relative to active surveillance

 allowing us to compare each treatment group’s QOL outcomes against active surveillance.13 
Standardized differences14 were calculated to compare the distributions of covariates 
between the cohorts both before and after PS weighting to assess that the covariate balancing 
adequately addressed measured confounding across cohorts.
Propensity-weighted QOL scores for each PCSI domain was calculated for each participant 
at each time point. Missing data at 3, 12, and 24 months were multiply imputed using the 
fully conditional specification approach.15,16 Multiple imputation was separately run for 
each of four domains within each treatment group for men with non-missing data at 
baseline. Briefly, this method sequentially regressed an outcome on the immediately 
preceding outcome (time point) score and baseline characteristics and replaced the missing 
values with values from observed (non-missing) data that were closest to the model-
predicted value for the respective observation. To account for potential non-independence 
due to weighting, robust standard errors were used in the computation of 95% confidence 
intervals from the imputed datasets. To account for uncertainty occurring due to imputation, 
final estimates were derived by pooling estimates from all imputed datasets. Missing QOL 
functional levels were also imputed using a similar approach. Ordinal logistic regression was 
used to impute missing levels using the preceding time-point functional level and QOL score 
and baseline characteristics as variables.
The primary goal of this study was to compare the domain scores of each treatment group 
(prostatectomy, RT, brachytherapy) against active surveillance. We used an established 
convention17–19 to denote clinically-meaningful differences in scores as those which exceed 
½-standard deviation of the baseline score of the active surveillance (control) group. In 
addition to analyses of the overall cohort, stratified subgroup analyses based on patients’ 
baseline QOL level in each domain were performed to assess if treatments differentially 
affected men who had different levels of baseline QOL.
All statistical tests were two-sided with significance threshold <0.05. Analysis was 
performed using SAS version 9.4.
Results
From January 2011 through June 2013, 1,419 men with localized prostate cancer and not yet 
started treatment signed informed consent and were enrolled; this represents 57% 
participation among eligible men.20 Participants vs. non-participants were younger (median 
age 65 vs 68), with non-significantly different Gleason scores and race.20 Among enrolled 
men, 69 did not receive any of the 4 modalities to be compared in this analysis, and an 
additional 209 did not complete any follow-up survey. Therefore, this analysis included a 
final sample of 1,141 men.
Among 1,141 men, 314 received active surveillance, 249 RT, 109 brachytherapy, and 469 
prostatectomy (Table 1). Among RT, 94.8% received intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and 
70.7% with image guidance; 86.6% of prostatectomy was robotic. Participants were socio-
demographically diverse in race, education and income. Prostatectomy patients were 
younger and had better baseline QOL than radiotherapy patients. Differences in baseline

 demographic characteristics and QOL were minimized with propensity weighting. After 
propensity weighting, median age was 66-67 across groups, and 77-80% were white.
Missing data in QOL are detailed in eTable 1. At 24 months, there was missing data in 
19-29% of participants across groups and QOL domains.
Sexual dysfunction:
Propensity-weighted mean domain scores across the 4 groups at each time point were 
summarized in Table 2. Sensitivity analysis which included the 209 patients with baseline 
but no follow-up survey data is shown in eTable. At baseline, propensity-weighted scores 
were 43.4 (active surveillance, 95% CI 39.2-47.6), 41.8 (RT, 95% CI 36.3-47.2), 46.4 
(brachytherapy, 95% CI, 36.1-56.7), and 41.6 (prostatectomy, 95% CI 35.6-47.6). Mean 
scores for the active surveillance group increased gradually over time. At 3 and 12 months 
but not 24 months, RT (3 months: +13.9, 95% CI 6.7-21.2; 12 months: +10.2, 95% CI 
3.1-17.1) and brachytherapy (3 months: +17.1, 95% CI 7.8-26.6; 12 months: +14.3, 95% CI 
4.6-24.0) patients had increased sexual dysfunction compared to active surveillance; 
however, these differences did not meet threshold for clinical significance. eTable 3 details 
sexual dysfunction scores in subgroups of patients who received RT alone and RT plus 
androgen deprivation therapy. Differences between prostatectomy vs. active surveillance met 
the threshold for clinical significance (3 months: +36.2, 95% CI 30.4-42.0; 12 months: 
+27.6, 95% CI 21.8-33.4).
Table 3 summarized propensity-weighted results stratifying participants by baseline sexual 
function level. For men who reported normal baseline sexual function, 57.1% (propensity-
weighted N=46.6/81.6) reported poor function at 24 months after prostatectomy, 27.2% after 
RT (N=25.5/93.8), 34.2% brachytherapy (N=27.1/79.2), and 25.2% active surveillance 
(N=22.7/90.1). For men with intermediate baseline function, larger proportions reported 
poor function at 24 months: 76.9% after prostatectomy (N=69.8/90.8), 55.0% for RT 
(N=41.8/76.0), 50.6% brachytherapy (N=34.9/69.0), and 45.9% active surveillance 
(N=37.2/81.0). Men who reported poor baseline sexual function largely remained with poor 
function at 24 months.
Urinary obstruction and irritation:
At baseline, propensity-weighted scores were 22.8 (active surveillance, 95% CI 21.2-24.3), 
22.3 (RT, 95% CI 20.3-24.4), 20.8 (brachytherapy, 95% CI, 18.3-23.3), and 22.6 
(prostatectomy, 95% CI 21.1-24.2)(Table 2). Compared to active surveillance, urinary 
obstruction and irritation scores increased after brachytherapy at 3 and 12 months but not 24 
months (3 months: +20.5, 95% CI 15.1-25.9; 12 months: +5.5, 95% CI 0.4-10.6), and 
increased after RT at 3 months (+11.7, 95% CI 8.7-14.8). Prostatectomy patients reported 
lower urinary obstruction and irritation compared to active surveillance at 12 and 24 months 
(12 months: −4.3, 95% CI −6.9 to −1.7; 24 months: −5.7, 95% CI −8.2 to −3.1). Score 
differences between brachytherapy and RT vs. active surveillance met threshold for clinical 
significance at 3-months.
Table 3 details 24 month outcomes in men with different baseline urinary obstruction and 
irritation levels. For men at normal baseline level, 52.7% (N=36.9/70.0) remained at normal

 24 months after prostatectomy, 48.8% (N=37.8/77.5) after RT and only 19.3% 
(N=17.3/89.6) after brachytherapy. For men who started with intermediate baseline urinary 
obstruction and irritation, 18.3-30.9% improved after surgical or radiation treatments to 
normal levels, while 15.0-37.6% worsened to poor. Most men (75.7%, 85.0/112.3) who had 
poor baseline urinary obstruction and irritation improved after prostatectomy by 2 years; 
45.9% of RT (N=48.1/104.8), 48.5% brachytherapy (N=44.7/92.2), and 43.3% 
(N=45.5/105.1) of active surveillance patients improved.
Urinary incontinence:
At baseline, propensity-weighted scores were 10.4 (active surveillance, 95% CI 8.2-12.8), 
9.9 (RT, 95% CI 7.5-12.4), 10.5 (brachytherapy, 95% CI, 3.8-17.2), and 9.7 (prostatectomy, 
95% CI 7.2-12.2)(Table 2). Incontinence scores were not significantly different between RT 
or brachytherapy versus active surveillance at 3, 12, and 24 months. For radical 
prostatectomy versus active surveillance, incontinence scores increased by 33.6 (3 months, 
95% CI 27.8-39.2), 18.2 (12 months, 95% CI 12.9-23.5), and 15.4 (24 months, 95% CI 
8.9-21.9); all of these differences were clinically significant.
For men with normal urinary control at baseline, 34.3% (N=74.5/217.2) reported normal 
control 24 months after prostatectomy, while 15.8% (N=34.4/217.7) reported poor control 
(Table 3). In other groups, proportions of patients who maintained normal urinary control 
were 73.0% RT (N=167.2/229.0), 64.8% brachytherapy (N=143.4/221.3), and 72.7% active 
surveillance (N=164.3/226.0). For men with intermediate urinary control at baseline, 
15.7-29.9% reported poor control at 24 months across the groups. Too few patients had 
baseline poor urinary control (N=50 total) for meaningful analysis of that subgroup.
Bowel Problems:
At baseline, propensity-weighted scores were 5.9 (active surveillance, 95% CI 5.0-6.8), 5.7 
(RT, 95% CI 4.6-6.7), 6.1 (brachytherapy, 95% CI 4.5-7.6), and 6.2 (prostatectomy, 95% CI 
5.2-7.3)(Table 2). Compared with active surveillance, RT increased scores at 3 months (+4.9, 
95% CI 2.4-7.4) and 24 months (+3.7, 95% CI 1.0-6.4). At 3 months, this difference was 
clinically meaningful. Scores between brachytherapy and prostatectomy vs. active 
surveillance were not significantly different at any time point.
After RT, 42.7% (N=56.7/132.8) of men who reported normal baseline level also reported 
normal level at 24 months (Table 3). Corresponding proportions were 46.8% after 
brachytherapy (N=50.2/107.3), 57.4% prostatectomy (N=70.7/123.2) and 57.2% active 
surveillance (N=76.7/134.1). In addition, 17.4% (N=23.1/132.8) of RT patients who started 
at a normal level worsened to poor at 24 months, while 5.6-9.3% of patients in other groups 
worsened to poor. Too few patients were at baseline poor level for meaningful analysis of 
that subgroup.
Discussion
Prostate cancer patients have multiple treatment options and face a confusing decision-
making process. Therefore, the comparative effectiveness of contemporary treatment options 
for localized prostate cancer is a top research priority according to the Institute of Medicine.

 1 While contemporary treatments (robotic surgery, intensity-modulated radiotherapy) were 
developed to reduce treatment-related morbidity, the comparative effectiveness of these 
treatments vs. active surveillance is unknown. A population-based cohort can be used to 
inform this question by providing timely data from patients who are representative of men 
with prostate cancer. This study addresses one aspect of this comparative effectiveness 
question by showing that contemporary treatment options were associated with distinct 
patterns of QOL changes. These data may help inform men in their treatment decision-
making process, and also inform the continued debate regarding prostate cancer screening. 
The US Preventive Services Task Force, in the current process of revising its screening 
recommendations, specifically indicated a need to review the harms of different treatment 
approaches.21 This study directly addresses this knowledge gap.
In light of recently published data from the ProtecT trial,4 this study provides new 
information. This is because the ProtecT trial started in 1999 and used older treatments (3D 
radiotherapy, non-robotic prostatectomy) which may have limited relevance to informing 
contemporary patients regarding current treatment options which consist of intensity-
modulated radiotherapy,2 robotic prostatectomy,22 and brachytherapy.23 The current study 
provides QOL outcomes of treatments representative of contemporary choices for patients; 
the surgical and radiotherapy treatments received by patients in this study (86.6% robotic 
prostatectomy, 94.8% intensity-modulated radiotherapy) are reflective of treatment patterns 
in the US.2,22 With advances in both surgical and radiotherapy technologies, the relative 
QOL results across treatment groups remain similar as those reported by the ProtecT trial: 
radical prostatectomy was associated with sexual dysfunction and urinary incontinence, 
while radiotherapy was associated with short-term urinary obstruction and irritation, and 
bowel symptoms.
Active surveillance is an emerging option for men with early prostate cancers,5 and served 
as a natural control group for this study, to help inform the decision for men considering this 
option vs. immediate treatment. This study showed that mean QOL scores for this group 
remained at baseline levels, until 12 months and after when urinary incontinence and sexual 
dysfunction scores noticeably increased. This coincides with the timing of guideline-
recommended repeat prostate biopsies on active surveillance, with each biopsy expected to 
detect a proportion of patients with cancer progression necessitating treatment. While 
surveillance is the most conservative option, it is notable that mean QOL scores at 24 
months were not clinically meaningfully different between this group and active treatment 
groups in most domains. This observation can be explained by the gradual progression of 
men on surveillance to treatment over time, while men who received immediate treatment 
experienced gradual improvement in treatment-related symptoms. These findings are 
consistent with those from the ProtecT trial,24 and provide information that can be used to 
help counsel patients – and demonstrates that, on average, active surveillance may be 
associated with preserved QOL, at least in the first 2 years after diagnosis.
While QOL research conventionally reports results using mean scores, it is well recognized 
that score changes are difficult to interpret by patients and physicians.10,12 Several 
approaches have been proposed to address this interpretability challenge, including 
definition of a “minimal clinically important difference” (MCID) or using an arbitrary 0.5-

 standard deviation change to denote clinically-meaningful change.17,18 A limitation of the 
PCSI is that it does not have a defined MCID through an anchor-based method, and 
therefore we took the latter approach in this study. It is also well-established that men with 
different levels of baseline urinary, bowel, and sexual function likely have different 
experiences after treatment.9 For example, men with no useful erectile function at baseline 
are unlikely to experience any meaningful positive or negative effect of their sexual function 
from treatment; therefore, including these men in overall mean score calculations blunts the 
observed effect (score changes) experienced by other men who have normal baseline 
function. The PCSI is unique among existing prostate cancer QOL instruments in having 
defined functional levels, which provides a framework for defining clinically-meaningful 
change and also allows stratification of patients by baseline function. Thus, an additional 
analysis was performed using QOL levels established by the PCSI instrument to 
complement the reported mean scores.
Physicians can use these data to provide more individualized counseling of their patients 
regarding expected outcomes of patients with similar levels of baseline function. For 
example, among men with normal sexual function at baseline, 57.1% were estimated to have 
poor function at 24 months after prostatectomy; 9% of patients reported preserved normal 
function, while the other one-third experienced declined but still useful sexual function. Men 
who chose active surveillance had the largest proportion (44.6%) with preserved normal 
sexual function at 24 months.
These data also revealed that some QOL aspects can improve after treatment. Older men 
commonly have benign prostatic hypertrophy with associated urinary obstructive symptoms, 
which can be improved by prostate cancer treatments. In the group of men who had an 
intermediate-level of baseline urinary obstruction and irritation symptoms, prostatectomy 
improved symptoms by 24 months in more patients (30.9%) than worsened (15.0%), and RT 
improved and worsened similar proportions. These findings are consistent with prior studies.
25,26 There are additional possible reasons for some patients experiencing improvements in 
urinary symptoms – including medical management of symptoms, and surgical and radiation 
treatments alleviating symptoms caused by the prostate cancer itself.
There are several strengths of this study. Study design was informed by collaboration with a 
broad group of stakeholders,20 with the goal that this study will provide information relevant 
to patients and clinicians. This study compared the 4 treatment options most relevant to 
contemporary patients. However, randomized data suggest that short-term QOL between 
open versus robotic prostatectomy are not significantly different.27 Population-based design 
facilitated a sociodemographically diverse cohort including patients who chose active 
surveillance, and not just patients treated at large academic centers. Another strength is that 
100% of patients reported pre-treatment QOL without recall, which allows accurate 
calculations of treatment effect. The study also utilized a consistent methodology for QOL 
assessment using telephone survey7 and time points based on treatment date, with 
measurements which captured both short-term (3 month) and longer-term changes.
There are several limitations of this study. As an observational study which is descriptive in 
nature, there were imbalances in baseline patient characteristics. Propensity weighting was

 used to minimize these imbalances across groups, but residual confounding is possible and 
there remained unbalanced disease characteristics across groups with favorable 
characteristics for active surveillance patients and relatively less favorable for RT. Patients 
were not blinded to treatment received, and patient expectations regarding outcomes from 
the treatment they received could affect their reporting of QOL. Enrollment in the study was 
only 57%, which could have led to a selection bias, although this was not out of the range of 
other studies.28 There was missing data especially with longer follow-up (19-29% at 24 
month time point), with differential response rates across groups. Further, while participants 
were recruited from one state, they are broadly representative of men with prostate cancer: 
the median age of NC ProCESS participants (66) is similar to prostate cancer patients across 
the US,29 and the types of radiation (94.8% IMRT) and surgical treatments (86.6% robotic) 
received are similar to US patterns of care studies.2,22 Also, the rapid case ascertainment 
system of North Carolina uniquely facilitated all participants to be enrolled prior to 
treatment. This study assessed sexual, urinary and bowel symptoms, which are most 
commonly affected after prostate cancer treatments, but did not assess general quality of life. 
In addition, QOL may continue to change more than 2 years after treatment. This analysis 
included results only through 2 years of follow-up, and further follow-up is ongoing. 
However, as the ProtecT trial showed,4 there may be little change in QOL after 2 years.
Conclusions:
In this cohort of men with localized prostate cancer, each treatment strategy was associated 
with distinct patterns of adverse effects over 2 years. These findings may promote treatment 
decisions that incorporate individual preferences.

 Key Points
Question:
What differences in quality of life are associated with radical prostatectomy, external 
beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and active surveillance after treatment for prostate 
cancer?
Findings:
In this population-based, prospective cohort of 1141 men diagnosed from 2011-2013, 
radical prostatectomy was associated with worse sexual dysfunction and urinary 
incontinence compared to active surveillance; external beam radiotherapy and 
brachytherapy worse short-term urinary obstruction and irritation, and external beam 
radiotherapy worse short-term bowel symptoms. However, by 24 months, mean scores 
between treatment groups vs. active surveillance were not significantly different in most 
domains.
Meaning:
Contemporary treatment strategies were associated with distinct patterns of adverse 
effects over 2 years.

PCSI domains:6 scores range from 0 to 100, with higher score indicating more symptoms and dysfunction. Minimally clinically important difference is not defined for this instrument.
*denotes clinically meaningful difference (vs. active surveillance) based on exceeding the threshold of ½ standard deviation of the active surveillance baseline score. As reported in Table 1, standard 
deviation scores were: urinary obstruction/irritation (13.5), urinary incontinence (20.4), bowel problems (8.0), and sexual dysfunction (37.6)
**raw (unweighted) numbers of patients with non-missing data.
Among active surveillance patients, 18.7% received treatment within 24 months: 6.2% radical prostatectomy, 6.9% external beam RT, 3.1% brachytherapy, and 2.4% other.
