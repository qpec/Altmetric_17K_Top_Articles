Regenerative processes in brain pathologies require the production of distinct neural cell
populations from endogenous progenitor cells. We have previously demonstrated that
oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) proliferation is crucial for oligodendrocyte (OL)
regeneration in a mouse model of neonatal hypoxia (HX) that reproduces diffuse white
matter injury (DWMI) of premature infants. Here we identify the histone deacetylase Sirt1 as
a Cdk2 regulator in OPC proliferation and response to HX. HX enhances Sirt1 and Sirt1/Cdk2
complex formation through HIF1a activation. Sirt1 deacetylates retinoblastoma (Rb) in the
Rb/E2F1 complex, leading to dissociation of E2F1 and enhanced OPC proliferation.
Sirt1 knockdown in culture and its targeted ablation in vivo suppresses basal and HX-induced
OPC proliferation. Inhibition of Sirt1 also promotes OPC differentiation after HX. Our results
indicate that Sirt1 is an essential regulator of OPC proliferation and OL regeneration
after neonatal brain injury. Therefore, enhancing Sirt1 activity may promote OL recovery
after DWMI.

ell regeneration observed in brain injury and in a variety
of
neurological
disorders—including
hypoxia
(HX)/
ischaemia, demyelination, stroke, spinal cord injury, and
Huntington’s or Alzheimer’s disease—depends on endogenous
progenitor cells that respond to various insults by expansion
of their pools1,2. HX is a major cause of diffuse white
matter injury (DWMI), which is associated with permanent
developmental
disabilities
in
prematurely
born
infants3–6.
DWMI is characterized by altered development and long-term
abnormalities of the white matter, caused by oligodendrocyte
(OL) loss and delayed functional myelination7–9. Proliferating OL
progenitor cells (OPCs) are the main source of newly generated
OLs and are capable of repopulating injured white matter regions,
leading to myelin regeneration and functional recovery10,11.
Current therapies for DWMI are still not curative, therefore it is
crucial to target endogenous OPCs and enhance their expansion
after injury to maximize white matter repair.
Using a mouse model of neonatal HX that reproduces
morphological
and
structural
brain
abnormalities
found
in DWMI of prematurely born infants12–16, we previously
demonstrated that HX triggers a regenerative response in OPCs
that involves enhanced proliferation through activation of the
Cdk2 pathway, and delayed differentiation caused by reduced
levels of p27Kip1 (ref. 14). However, the molecular pathways
that play a crucial role in coupling HX to enhanced OPC
proliferation
are
still
unknown.
Defining
these
molecular
mechanisms in DWMI is of crucial importance to reactivate
intrinsic developmental pathways functionally involved in OL
regeneration
and
ultimately
in
white
matter
recovery.
Furthermore, these mechanisms might be relevant to a variety
of pathologies of the developing central nervous system, as the
regenerative response of neural progenitors to injury in the
immature brain is largely unexplored.
The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent
class III histone deacetylase (HDAC) Sirt1 is involved in normal
cell development and fate determination, as well as in ageing,
inflammatory responses and energy metabolism17–20. Among
many different roles in metabolism and calorie restriction,
Sirt1—as a sensor of redox status in cells—is also involved in
the response to environmental stress modulated by HX through
deacetylation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF1a)21–23. Sirt1
is also involved in modulating the activity of cell cycle regulatory
proteins, as this is determined by their phosphorylation and
acetylation
state.
Cyclin-dependent
kinases
(Cdks)—which
are positively regulated by their regulatory subunits (cyclins,
Cyc)—phosphorylate members of the pocket protein family
(Rb, p107 and p130)24. In turn, the acetylation state of both
Cdks and pocket proteins is regulated by HDACs, including
Sirt1 (ref. 25).
Sirt1,
when
engaged
in
mitotic
cell
activity26,
is
transcriptionally regulated by p53, E2F1, FoxO3a and the
HIC1–CtBP complex27, and undergoes a variety of post-
translational modifications28. Sirt1 deacetylase activity is also
regulated by formation of the Sirt1/Cdk1/Cyc B complex and
subsequent Sirt1 phosphorylation by Cdk1 (ref. 26). Conversely,
Sirt1
deacetylates
a
member
of
the
Cdk2
pathway,
the
retinoblastoma (Rb) protein29, which plays a crucial functional
role in G1–S transition of the cell cycle.
A recent report demonstrated that Sirt1 maintains mouse
embryonic stem cells in an undifferentiated/self-renewing state,
particularly under oxidative conditions18, suggesting that Sirt1
might play an important role in self-renewal and proliferation of
progenitor/stem cells. The role of Sirt1 in neural progenitor
proliferation in early postnatal brain development—in particular
in response to injury—has not been defined. Furthermore, it has
not been determined whether Sirt1 modifies neural progenitor
cell cycle activity through deacetylation of individual members of
the Cdk2/Rb/E2F1 complex.
In the present study, we investigated the roles of Sirt1 in
immature neural cell proliferation, and as a deacetylase in
HIF1a-regulated pathways in the context of early postnatal OPC
response to HX. We identify Sirt1 as a novel, major regulator of
basal OPC proliferation and regeneration in response to HX in
neonatal white matter. We demonstrate Sirt1 phosphorylation by
Cdk2, and also elucidate the mechanism by which Sirt1 targets
individual members of the Cdk2 signalling pathway, regulating
their deacetylation, complex formation and E2F1 release, mole-
cular events, which drive Cdk2-mediated OPC proliferation14,30.
Results
Neonatal HX regulates Sirt1 expression in parenchymal OPCs.
We have previously demonstrated that neonatal HX enhances
proliferation of two distinct pools of glial progenitors in a
time-dependent manner14. HX (from P3 until P11) induces
proliferation of white matter NG2-expressing (NG2 þ) OPCs for
a week after the insult, conversely proliferation of SVZ NG2 þ
cells continues for at least a month14. Since white matter
development is drastically disrupted after neonatal brain injury16,
we focused on the regenerative response of parenchymal white
matter OPCs after HX. We have previously shown that Cdk2
plays an important role in regulating basal and HX-induced OPC
proliferation14, but the molecular mechanisms involved are
still undefined. It has been demonstrated that many cell cycle
proteins that control cell proliferation are sirtuin substrates31, and
sirtuins—including Sirt1—regulate proliferation of different cell
types31. Therefore, we focused on the role of sirtuins, particularly
Sirt1, in regulating OPC proliferation after HX.
It is known that NAD regulates Sirt1 activity, and serves as a
major coenzyme in redox reactions32. Significant alterations of
the cellular redox status have been demonstrated during both
self-renewal and cell differentiation33. To study whether HX
modifies levels of the intracellular nucleotide NAD, we performed
nicotinamide assay and demonstrated higher levels of NAD in
white matter cells after HX (Fig. 1a).
To determine the specific contribution of different classes of
HDACs to the cellular changes induced by HX, we performed a
fluorometric HDAC activity assay in normoxic (NX) and HX
white matter tissue. The activity of all HDACs was significantly
higher after HX (Fig. 1b), however the relative increase in sirtuins
(class III deacetylases) activity was much higher than the increase
observed in HDACs I and II (Fig. 1b). In summary, our results
obtained in cultured cells and in tissue strongly suggest that Sirt1
could be a possible mediator of the effects of HX on OPC redox
state during cell cycle progression.
To determine whether enhanced NAD levels play a role in class
III deacetylase activation after HX, we performed in vitro
experiment, in which NX and HX cells were cultured in control
medium, or in the presence of NADH or NAD. We hypothesized
that NAD promotes deacetylation of Cdk2 through sirtuins,
particularly Sirt1; therefore, we immunoprecipitated Cdk2 to
determine its acetylation status. Western blot analysis revealed
lower levels of acetylated Cdk2 after HX in control medium,
indicating increased deacetylation. In the presence of NADH,
deacetylated Cdk2 levels were similar in NX and HX lysates.
Conversely, exposure of the cultures to NAD markedly enhanced
Cdk2 deacetylation (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). To determine
whether NAD-stimulated deacetylation of Cdk2 was mediated by
Sirt1, we knocked down Sirt1 expression in cultured NX and HX
cells after exposure to high concentrations of NAD. Western blot
analysis revealed higher levels of acetylated Cdk2 after Sirt1
knockdown, indicating that Sirt1 is the primary deacetylase

 of Cdk2 under conditions of HX and increased NAD levels
(Supplementary Fig. 1c). Cdk2 deacetylation is likely to induce its
kinase activity, given that acetylation by the acetyltransferase
P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) has been shown to inactivate
Cdk2 kinase activity34).
We next determined whether HX induced changes in Sirt1
expression in white matter in vivo. Western blot analysis on
whole lysates from NX and HX white matter revealed higher
levels of total Sirt1 expression after HX (Fig. 1c). Previous analysis
identified
13
amino-acid
residues—mainly
at
serine
(Ser)
and threonine (Thr)—as potential Sirt1 phosphorylation sites28.
We focused on two of these sites (Ser27 and Ser47), as they match
minimal consensus sequences of Cdk phosphorylation substrates,
which are believed to stabilize the level of Sirt1 protein28.

that
HX

phosphorylation

phosphorylation (Fig. 1c). Higher expression of pSirt1 Ser47 may
reflect direct phosphorylation of this site by Cdks, possibly by Cdk2.
Consistent with enhanced expression of total Sirt1 protein
levels in white matter, HX also increased the percentage of
Sirt1 þ cells in white matter (Fig. 1d,e). We have previously

 phosphodiesterase (CNP)-EGFP mouse, in which all develop-
mental stages of the OL lineage can be visualized based on EGFP
expression, the majority of proliferating EGFP þ cells under
normal or pathological conditions are OPCs14,35. Therefore, we
wanted to determine whether Sirt1 expression was upregulated in
proliferative OPCs. Cellular analysis in white matter of CNP-
EGFP mice revealed that HX increased Sirt1 expression in both
NG2 þ and NG2 þBrdU þ OPCs (Fig. 1f–h). To determine
whether
HX-induced
changes
in
Sirt1
occurred
at
the
transcriptional level, we analysed relative levels of Sirt1 mRNA
transcripts in NG2 þEGFP þ OPCs fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS)-purified from NX and HX white matter. Higher
levels of Sirt1 mRNAs were detected after HX in this cell
population
(Fig.
1i);
conversely,
Sirt1
transcripts
were
downregulated in NG2-negative EGFP þ OLs, along with lower
expression levels of Olig2 and MBP mRNAs (Fig. 1i).
Further cellular analysis of white matter in wild-type (WT) and
CNP-EGFP mice showed that although HX elevated the total
percentage and proliferation of NG2 þ and Mash1 þ progenitor
cells (Supplementary Fig. 2a–f), Sirt1 expression was enhanced
only in NG2 þ, but not in Mash1 þ cells (Supplementary Fig. 2g).
Similar effects of HX on Sirt1 expression in glial progenitors were
also observed in the SVZ (Supplementary Fig. 3). Finally, no
change in the numbers of GFAP þ astrocytes, CC1 þ mature OLs
and Iba1 þ microglia that expressed Sirt1 was observed in white
matter (Supplementary Fig. 4). Altogether, these results indicate
that HX upregulates Sirt1 expression and phosphorylation in the
developing white matter, particularly in proliferating OPCs
expressing NG2. In addition, HX does not alter Sirt1 expression
in other glial cell types.
To determine whether Sirt1 plays a specific role in OPC
proliferation in neonatal white matter, we used a model of focal
(lysolecithin-induced) demyelination of adult white matter35.
We analysed white matter lesions at 7 days after demyelination,
that is, at a time point when OPC proliferation is maximal35.
Differently from neonatal HX, focal demyelination led to a
reduction of Sirt1 þ
and Sirt1 þBrdU þ
cells in the adult
white matter (Supplementary Fig. 5a–c). Demyelination also
reduced the percentage of NG2 þ progenitors expressing Sirt1,
as well as the percentage of proliferating Sirt1 þNG2 þ cells
(Supplementary Fig. 5d,e). Consistent with previously published
data35, enhanced astrocyte and microglial cell numbers were
found in the lesioned area (Supplementary Fig. 5f,g), however
no changes in Sirt1 expression were detected in these cells
(Supplementary Fig. 5f,i,j). Finally, we also observed lower
percentages of CC1 þ mature OLs and CC1 þSirt1 þ cells after
focal demyelination (Supplementary Fig. 5f–h). Altogether, these
results demonstrate that focal demyelination of adult white
matter causes opposite effects on Sirt1 expression compared with
HX, indicating that enhanced Sirt1 expression observed after
neonatal HX is specific for this type of injury.
It has been previously demonstrated that HIF1a regulates
Sirt1 transcriptional expression in vitro and in vivo21. HIF1a is
hydroxylated by specific prolyl-hydroxylases and targeted for
rapid proteasomal degradation by the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL)
tumour suppressor36. Therefore, to examine the effect of
HIF1a
stabilization
on
Sirt1
expression,
we
selectively
ablated VHL expression in OPCs and purified these cells
from Plpcre-ERT2;VHL(fl/fl) (VHL cKO) neonatal brains by
immunopanning37. Comparing OPCs isolated from VHL cKO
mice with and without treatment with tamoxifen, we found that
HIF1a stabilization enhanced Sirt1 expression, as shown by
reverse
transcription–PCR
(RT–PCR;
Fig.
2a).
Next,
we
determined whether HX-induced regulation of Sirt1 protein in
OPCs depended on HIF1a. Immunoblotting of Hif1a revealed a
time-dependent increase in protein level with a peak of
expression at 1 week after HX (P18), followed by a decrease at
later stages (P45; Fig. 2b,c). In white matter of Hif1a knockout
mice (HIF1a KO) exposed to HX, we found a significantly lower
number of proliferating Sirt1 þ cells at P18 (Fig. 2d), as well as
proliferating NG2 þ progenitors (Fig. 2e). Finally, in the absence
of Hif1a, HX had no effect on Sirt1 expression in white matter as
determined by western blot (Fig. 2f,g). In these experiments,
HIF1a ablation had no effect on basal Sirt1 expression under NX.
Altogether, these findings demonstrate that (i) HX-induced Sirt1
expression in OPCs depends on the presence of Hif1a and (ii) HX
regulates Hif1a expression in a time-dependent manner.
Sirt1 regulates OPC proliferation in cultured cells. The changes
in Sirt1 expression observed in OPCs after HX suggest a func-
tional involvement of this HDAC in HX-induced OPC pro-
liferation in the developing white matter. To investigate a possible
functional role of Sirt1 in cell proliferation after neonatal brain
injury, we first performed a knockdown of Sirt1 expression in
cultured white matter cells obtained from NX and HX mice.
Western blot analysis showed that siRNA-mediated knockdown
resulted in more than 90% decrease in Sirt1 expression in both NX
and HX cells (Fig. 3a,b). Sirt1 knockdown resulted in a decrease in
basal OPC proliferation from 7.32±1.3 to 1.56±0.6% (mean±-
s.e.m.; Fig. 3c). HX caused a twofold increase in the percentage of
BrdU þ cells in cultures treated with a scrambled control siRNA
(Fig. 3c), but no effects in cultures transfected with Sirt1 siRNA
(Fig. 3c). Furthermore, the increase in percentage of NG2þ cells
observed after HX was prevented by Sirt1 siRNA treatment
(Fig. 3d,e). We then used sirtinol, a strong inhibitor of Sirt1 activ-
ity38,39, to further demonstrate a role for Sirt1 in OPC proliferation
after HX. Treatment of cultured OPCs with sirtinol abolished the
effects of HX on proliferation (Fig. 3f). Altogether, both the siRNA
and sirtinol experiments consistently point to Sirt1 as an important
regulator of basal and HX-induced OPC proliferation.
To determine whether Sirt1 plays a specific role in white
matter OPC proliferation after HX, we also investigated the role
of Sirt1 in cultured SVZ OPCs. Differently from white matter
OPCs, treatment with Sirt1 siRNA did not modify basal or
HX-induced changes in SVZ OPC proliferation and number
(Supplementary Fig. 6). These results indicate that Sirt1 plays a
white matter-specific role in regulating basal and HX-induced
OPC proliferation.
Finally, we also assessed the consequences of Sirt1 inhibition
on OPC differentiation in culture by immunolabelling with OL
markers, including Olig2, O4 and GalC. In HX cells treated with
scrambled control, a reduction in Olig2 þ OL lineage cells was
observed, as well as a decrease in O4 þ pre-OLs and in GalC þ
mature OLs (Fig. 4a–f). siRNA-mediated Sirt1 inactivation
increased the percentage of cells expressing Olig2, O4 and GalC
(Fig. 4a–f). Consistent with these findings, higher levels of Olig2,
CNP and MBP mRNA transcripts were also detected in HX
cultures after siRNA-mediated Sirt1 inactivation (Fig. 4g). In
addition, sirtinol treatment also promoted cell differentiation in
HX cultures, but had no effects on NX cells (Fig. 4h,i). These data
indicate that Sirt1 activity in OPCs regulates the balance between
OPC proliferation and differentiation after HX.
Sirt1 regulates OPC proliferation in vivo. To study the func-
tional role of Sirt1 in OPC development after HX in vivo, we
generated an inducible Sirt1 knockout mouse strain (Sirt1F/
F;PDGFRCreER;RosaYFP, Sirt1-cKO) in which Sirt1 is selectively
inactivated in OPCs after tamoxifen injection. We first compared
tamoxifen-injected Sirt1-cKO mice with those which were not
injected. Tamoxifen induced Cre recombination and reduced
Sirt1 expression in white matter cells (Supplementary Fig. 7a,b).
We then compared tamoxifen-injected Sirt1-cKO mice with

 tamoxifen-injected WT littermates. Reduced Sirt1 expression was
observed in white matter cells in Sirt1-cKO mice, as compared
with WT (Supplementary Fig. 7c,d). Importantly, virtually no
PDGFRCreER cells displayed Sirt1 expression (Supplementary
Fig. 7d).
In conditional Sirt1-cKO mice, we observed a reduced
percentage of proliferating cells in NX white matter compared
with WT (5.92±0.75%—WT littermates; 3.62±0.23%—Sirt1-
cKO, mean±s.e.m.; Fig. 5a–c). Gain-of-function experiments,
in which cultured NX cells were transfected with either control
or Sirt1 plasmid showed an increase in proliferation from
15.33±2.56 to 30.50±1.6%, mean±s.e.m. (Fig. 5d,e). Moreover,
decreased cell proliferation observed in OPC-specific Sirt1
knockout
(from
15.33±2.6
to
6.6±0.5%,
mean±s.e.m.;
Fig. 5e,f) was rescued by incubation with Sirt1-expressing plasmid
(29.78±07%, mean±s.e.m.; Fig. 5f). These results support the
idea that Sirt1 also regulates basal OPC proliferation.
To determine if Sirt1 regulates white matter OPC proliferation
after HX in vivo, we first compared cell proliferation in WT and
Sirt1-cKO mice. HX-induced OPC proliferation was completely
prevented by Sirt1 inactivation in OPCs (Fig. 5a–c). Almost no
proliferating OPCs were found in white matter of Sirt1-cKO mice
after HX (Fig. 5c), indicating a major role for Sirt1 in regulating
proliferation of PDGFRa-expressing OPCs after HX in vivo.
Next we determined whether Sirt1 overexpression in white
matter OPCs rescued their proliferative potential after HX.
Therefore, we overexpressed Sirt1 in white matter cells cultured
from WT and Sirt1-cKO mice. In WT cultures, HX enhanced cell
proliferation and the percentage of NG2 þ progenitor cells after
transfection with either a control (pHA) plasmid or after
transfection with a pSirt1 plasmid (Fig. 5d,e). Conversely, in
cells isolated from Sirt1-cKO mice and transfected with the
control pHA plasmid, HX had no effects on the percentage of
BrdU þ and NG2 þ cells (Fig. 5d,f). Basal cell proliferation was
restored in NX cells after Sirt1 rescue, and so was the effect of HX
on cell proliferation and percentage of NG2 þ cells (Fig. 5e).
Altogether, these data indicate that Sirt1 plays a crucial functional
role in HX-induced OPC proliferation.

both Cdk2 and Cdk1 (ref. 40), therefore we also investigated
Cdk1/Cyc E interaction, and we observed HX-induced formation
of
the
Cdk1/Cyc
E
complex
(Supplementary
Fig.
8b,c).
Conversely, Cdk4/Cyc D and Cdk1/Cyc B1 complexes were not
significantly altered by HX (Supplementary Fig. 8b,c). Previous
studies demonstrated that Cdk1 can functionally compensate for
the loss of Cdk2 by forming a complex with Cyc E (ref. 40). Our
data indicate that Cdk1 can form a complex with Cyc E even in
the presence of Cdk2, suggesting that Cdk1 may play a supportive
role in HX-induced OPC proliferation.
We then analysed formation of Cdk/tumour suppressor
Rb
complexes,
as
Cdks
regulate
Rb
activity
through
its
phosphorylation41,42.
Immunoprecipitation
(IP)
analysis
demonstrated interaction between Rb, and either Cdk1 or Cdk2
under NX conditions (Supplementary Fig. 8d,e). However, only
Rb/Cdk2 complex formation was enhanced after HX, leading to
Rb phosphorylation, as demonstrated by enhanced Rb807/811
phosphorylation (Fig. 6d,e). These findings indicate that Rb is a
main substrate for HX-induced, Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation.
In addition, we observed that HX did not affect Rb/Cdk1 complex
formation (Supplementary Fig. 8d,e), indicating that Cdk2 is the
main kinase that interacts with, and likely phosphorylates Rb
after HX.
It has been shown that Rb forms complexes with E2F1
and E2F2 transcription factors42, and hyper-phosphorylation of
Rb by Cdks causes dissociation of Rb/E2F complexes, thereby
facilitating E2F-dependent transcription of genes that mediate S
phase entry43. Therefore, we analysed regulation of Rb/E2Fs

 complex formation by HX. Higher levels of E2F1 and E2F2 were
detected in white matter after HX, together with lower expression
of the Rb/E2F1 complex (Supplementary Fig. 8f,g), indicating
higher levels of unbound E2F1 in white matter after HX.
No
changes
were
observed
in
Rb/E2F2
complex
levels
(Supplementary Fig. 8f,g). These data indicate that elevated
levels of unbound E2F1 are likely responsible for higher cell
proliferation observed in white matter after HX.
Altogether, our data indicate that HX induces formation of the
Cdk2/Cyc E, Cdk1/Cyc E, Rb/Cdk2 and pRb807/811/Cdk2
complexes and induces dissociation of the Rb/E2F1 complex,
strongly suggesting that these proteins are functionally involved
in HX-induced cell proliferation in white matter.
Sirt1 regulates the Cdk2 pathway in white matter OPCs.
To investigate whether Sirt1 regulates the cell cycle protein
complexes
identified
above,
we
analysed
the
interaction
between Sirt1 and these complexes by first determining their
phosphorylation and acetylation status.
We first hypothesized that Cdk2 and Cyc E interact with Sirt1.
Immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis of white matter
tissue demonstrated that HX selectively enhanced formation of
the pSirt1 Ser47/Cdk2 and Sirt1/Cyc E complexes (Fig. 6a,b).
A recent report demonstrates that Sirt1 is mainly phosphorylated
by
Cdk1
(ref.
28),
and
we
observed
pSirt1
Ser47/Cdk1,
Sirt1/Cyc D and Sirt1/Cdk4 complex formation in NX, but this
was not modified by HX (Fig. 6a,b).
Since phosphorylated Sirt1 is found to be complexed with
Cdk2, we determined whether the loss of Cdk2 would affect Sirt1
phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitation revealed that suppressed
Cdk2 expression with Cdk2 siRNA in NX and HX white matter
cells caused a decrease of pSirt1 Ser47 levels in cultured NX and
HX white matter cells (Fig. 6c), indicating that Cdk2 regulates
Sirt1 phosphorylation.
Since
Rb
activity
is
regulated
by
phosphorylation
and
acetylation29, we analysed Rb/Sirt1 complex formation and
found
that
this
was
upregulated
after
HX
(Fig.
6d,e).
Furthermore, Rb deacetylation was also enhanced after HX

 (Fig. 6d,e), suggesting direct involvement of Sirt1 in Rb
deacetylation. However, complex formation between pSirt1
Ser47 or pSirt1 Ser27 with Rb was not significantly altered with
HX (Fig. 6d,e), suggesting that these phosphorylation events on
Sirt1 are not specifically associated with Rb deacetylation in the
context of HX.
Interactions between Sirt1 and Rb or Cdk2 induced by HX
were also observed in FACS-purified NG2 þ OPCs (Fig. 6f,g),
indicating that all three proteins, Sirt1, Cdk2 and Rb, interact
with each other during OPC proliferation induced by HX.
To study whether inhibition of Sirt1 activity altered Rb
deacetylation after HX, we performed IP on NX and HX control
cells and cells treated with sirtinol. Compared with NX cultures,
HX enhanced the expression of Rb/Sirt1 complex, and Rb
deacetylation was elevated (Fig. 6h). However, after sirtinol
treatment, expression of the Rb/Sirt1 complex was reduced after
HX, with increased expression of acetylated Rb, indicating that
deacetylation of Rb is mostly dependent on Sirt1 activity. Also,
after blocking Sirt1 activity through sirtinol, HX reduced the
expression of the Rb/Cdk2 complex (Fig. 6h), suggesting that
Sirt1 plays an important role in this complex formation. Finally,
since we demonstrate a strong interaction between Sirt1 and Rb
after HX, we additionally investigated a subcellular co-localization
of these proteins in NX and HX cultures. In vitro immuno-
labelling revealed that under NX conditions Sirt1 co-localized
with Rb mainly in nucleus; however, HX altered Sirt1 and Rb co-
localization into cytoplasm (Fig. 6i,j). This suggests an interactive
role of Sirt1 and Rb in cytoplasm under HX conditions.
Neonatal HX induces Sirt1 translocation to the cell cytoplasm.
Sirt1
deacetylates
both
histone
and
non-histone
proteins,
including a number of transcription factors27. Thus, changes in
subcellular localization are likely to play an important role
in the regulation of many Sirt1-dependent cellular processes44.

 immunostaining was also observed (Supplementary Fig. 9a).
However, the intensity of Sirt1 nuclear staining decreased by
B80% over a 120 min time period after HX. A reduction of
B60% was observed within the first 15 mins after HX, followed
by a further time-dependent decline (Supplementary Fig. 9b).
After HX, a significant subpopulation of white matter cells
displaying Sirt1 expression exclusively in the cytoplasm was
observed (Supplementary Fig. 9c). In both NX and HX white
matter, a small percentage of cells displayed expression of Sirt1 in
both nucleus and cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig. 9c).

using specific anti-MEK 1/2 antibody (Supplementary Fig. 9f).

 co-localization with anti-Golgin-97 antibody in Golgi apparatus
(Supplementary Fig. 9f). Since Sirt1 is synthesized in the
cytoplasm, these data indicate that either HX prevents Sirt1
shuttling to the nucleus, or causes re-shuttling from the nucleus
to the cytoplasm. In either case, increased Sirt1 in the cytoplasm
likely has important functional consequences, as this subcellular
localization could facilitate its interaction with cytoplasmic
shuttling of Rb protein47.
Sirt1 inactivation decreases Cdk2 and Rb complex formation.
To determine the role of Sirt1 in modulating the ability of Cdk2
to form complexes with Cyc E and Rb, we performed IP analysis
on NX and HX cells from white matter transfected with Sirt1
siRNA or scrambled control. Under these conditions, a reduction
in Cdk2 and Rb deacetylation was observed, along with a
reduction in Cdk2/Cyc E and Cdk2/Rb complex formation.
(Fig. 7a,b,d,e). These data indicate that loss of deacetylation by
Sirt1 decreases Cdk2/Cyc E and Cdk2/Rb complex formation,
which likely decreases cell proliferation. Consistent with this
notion, proliferation assays demonstrated a significant reduction
in the percentage of BrdU þ cells in both NX and HX cultures
treated with Cdk2 siRNA. This was accompanied by an increased
percentage of cells expressing Olig2 þ (Fig. 7c,f), consistent with
the interpretation that Cdk2 activity, similar to that of Sirt1,
supports basal and HX-induced progenitor cell proliferation at
the expense of differentiation and Olig2 þ cell formation.
It has been previously demonstrated that Sirt1 deacetylates and
represses the activity of FoxO transcription factors, including
FoxO1, FoxO3a and FoxO4 (refs 48,49). In NX and HX white
matter cells, FoxO3a acetylation is increased in the absence of
Sirt1 (Fig. 7g). Knockdown of FoxO3a gene in both NX and HX
cells enhanced their proliferation and reduced the percentage of
Olig2 þ cells (Fig. 7g–i). These results point to an interaction
between Sirt1 and FoxO3a, and opposing roles for Sirt1 and
FoxO3a in OPC proliferation and OL differentiation.
To investigate the causal relationship between Cdk2 and Sirt1
activity, we used Cdk2 KO mice, in which the Cdk2 gene was
silenced in exons 4 and 5 (ref. 50). We immunolabelled white
matter tissue with anti-pSirt1 Ser47 and anti-Hif1a antibodies.
In both WT and Cdk2 KO littermates, HX selectively increased
the percentage of Hif1a þ cells in white matter (Fig. 8a,b).
In contrast, Cdk2 KO abolished the phosphorylated Sirt1 cellular
response
to
HX
(Fig.
8c,d),
indicating
that
HX-induced
phosphorylation of Sirt1 at Ser47 is dependent on Cdk2.
This indicates that Cdk2 does not positively regulate Hif1a as
an upstream factor, consistent with the findings of Hubbi et al.51,
but is required for Sirt1 phosphorylation. To determine whether
a
hierarchy
exists
between
Cdk2
deacetylation
and
Sirt1
phosphorylation, we tested the possibility that Sirt1 deacetylase

 activity was required for Sirt1 phosphorylation. Inhibition of Sirt1
activity with sirtinol resulted in decreased pSirt1 Ser47 expression
in both NX and HX conditions (Fig. 8e). Taken together, these
data demonstrate that Cdk2 deletion does not decrease Hif1a
expression induced by HX, and strongly suggests that the
phosphorylation of Sirt1 at Ser47 by Cdk2 requires Sirt1
deacetylase activity.
Altogether our molecular data indicate that HX increases levels
of Hif1a in parallel with NAD, which, respectively, elevates Sirt1
expression and induces its activation. Increased levels of activated
Sirt1 in turn deacetylate Cdk2 and Rb. Deacetylation of Cdk2
leads to phosphorylation of Sirt1 and Rb. Rb deacetylation and
phosphorylation facilitate dissociation of the Rb/E2F1 complex.
Unbound E2F1 is crucial for G1/S transition, and its release from
the Rb complex results in enhanced OPC proliferation after HX
(Supplementary Fig. 10).
Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrate that the epigenetic
modulator Sirt1 is functionally involved in the expansion of the
endogenous OPC pool in the NX-developing brain and after
neonatal HX. We show that OPC proliferation in both conditions
is controlled by the Cdk2 signalling pathway, in particular by
post-translational modifications of Cdk2 and Rb that depend on
Sirt1 activation. We also demonstrate that HIF1a activation
occurs after HX with a time course consistent with a role in OPC
proliferation and increased Sirt1 activity. Also, a higher level of
NAD increases Sirt1 activity as indicated by a lower level of Cdk2
acetylation. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibition of Sirt1
expression in vitro and in vivo not only prevents OPC
proliferation but also promotes OL maturation in HX white
matter. These findings reveal that optimal Sirt1 activity is
essential to balance OPC proliferation and OL regeneration.
In the present study, Sirt1 expression is specifically upregulated
in proliferating white matter NG2 þ OPCs. Our gain- and
loss-of-function studies indicate that Sirt1 is a part of basic
regulatory mechanism of OPC proliferation, reducing cell
proliferation after Sirt1 siRNA knockdown and increasing
proliferation after Sirt1 overexpression. In contrast to earlier
observations in the adult brain52, which reported that Sirt1 is
absent in mature astrocytes, we detected its expression in a
small percentage of GFAP þ and Iba1 þ cells of the developing
white matter. Importantly, as Sirt1 shows both Hif1a-dependent
and Hif1a-independent functions in proliferation, these studies

 establish Sirt1 as an essential component of the regulatory
mechanism that controls OPC proliferation in NX, which is also
clearly recruited in the cellular response to HX.
After chronic neonatal HX, increased cytoplasmic Sirt1 in
OPCs strongly correlates with their proliferative state, suggesting
that Sirt1 is a main regulator of the proliferative response
of OPCs. Direct functional evidence was obtained both in vitro
and in vivo, demonstrating that downregulation of Sirt1 protein
expression in cultured OPCs, as well as excision of the Sirt1 gene
in Sirt1-cKO mice severely reduced OPC expansion after HX,
indicating that Sirt1 inactivation reduces the OPC response to
neonatal white matter injury.
Our previous studies on rodent model of chronic HX, which
recapitulates many cellular and functional characteristics in focal
ischaemic injuries in preterm infants, demonstrated that p27Kip1,
main Cdk2 inhibitor, is involved in OL differentiation in
hypoxic white matter14. Since Sirt1 negatively regulates p27Kip1
expression53, the increased Sirt1 that is observed in this model is
consistent with decreased p27Kip1 levels after white matter injury.
Previous analysis of the adult white matter demonstrated that
genetic inactivation of Sirt1 expanded the OPC pool after
demyelination, that is, that Sirt1 inhibited demyelination-
induced OPC proliferation in the adult brain52. The opposite
regulation of Sirt1 in proliferating OPCs in neonatal versus adult
white matter injury could be related to intrinsic differences in
OPC properties and/or changes in the cellular environment
that occur during white matter maturation. Differences in the
type of injury used in these experimental models (global
hypomyelination induced by HX versus focal demyelination)
also
affect
Sirt1
regulation.
Consistent
with
Rafalski’s
studies52 and opposite to HX, our analysis of Sirt1 response
after
lysolecithin-induced
demyelination
demonstrated
a
downregulation of Sirt1 expression in adult NG2 þ progenitors,
which may indicate a context-dependent role for Sirt1 function in
the regenerative response of OPCs.
Our previous studies demonstrated that under pathological
conditions NG2 þ cells generate OLs35. Here we showed that
NG2 þ, not Mash1 þ, progenitor cells are particularly susceptible
to changes in Sirt1 expression after HX. HX-specific response of
NG2 þ progenitors expressing Sirt1 can significantly inhibit the
maturation of OLs, which are necessary for myelin formation. It
is possible that Sirt1 upregulation serves to replenish the OPC
pool as these regenerate OLs, and other signals may later initiate
the decline of Sirt1 activity to allow OPC differentiation and
white matter recovery. When we investigated the regional
specificity of Sirt1 function after HX, we found that—differently
from white matter—inactivation of Sirt1 had no effect on
proliferation of neural progenitor cells in the neonatal SVZ,
where we still detected a higher number of proliferating Ki67 þ
cells and NG2 þ progenitors. These results are in agreement
with analysis of the adult SVZ, demonstrating that inactivation
of Sirt1 enhances neural stem cells (NSC) proliferation52.
Taken together, the analyses of the developing and adult brain
discussed above supports the notion that Sirt1 plays a crucial
temporally and spatially restricted role in glial regeneration after
brain injury.
In the adult brain, deregulation of the sirtuin pathways has
been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative
disorders, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s
disease, and in multiple sclerosis17,54. In these pathologies,
Sirt1 plays a neuroprotective role through activation of multiple
downstream targets55,56. Sirt1 activation has also been established
in HX/ischaemia and in oxidative stress57. Sirt1 responsiveness to
oxygen concentrations is regulated by the HX-induced factors
HIFs, specifically the HIF1a and HIF-2a isoforms23. Our results
in the developing brain demonstrate that chronic HX enhanced
HIF1a
expression,
and
that
HX-induced
Sirt1
expression
was HIF1a-dependent. In summary, our data point to HIF1a-
dependent Sirt1 activation as a major regulatory step in white
matter OPC proliferation. Interestingly, in vivo analysis of HIF1/2
KO mice revealed reduced OPC proliferation at E18 (ref. 37),
suggesting that a similar regulatory pathway could also exist in
development.
A number of studies demonstrated that small molecules either
activating or inhibiting Sirt1 mitigate the cellular consequences of
many neurological disorders and cancer17,58. Our in vitro data
demonstrate that inhibition of Sirt1 activity either by siRNA or by
the Sirt1 inhibitor sirtinol promotes oligodendrogenesis after HX.
Although therapeutic use of this inhibitor is limited by its
low potency and the lack of high specificity, the effectiveness
of Sirtinol to induce cell growth arrest has already been
demonstrated in cancer cells, pointing to potential clinical
applications39. In our chronic HX model, sirtinol treatment
accelerated OL regeneration and maturation, which represent
crucial steps in white matter regeneration after neonatal injury16.
Therefore, modulation of Sirt1 activity by sirtinol might also hold
potential therapeutic implications for DWMI in prematurely
born infants.
In agreement with the notion that Sirt1 activity is regulated by
nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling and post-translational modifications
in Sirt1 alter its subcellular localization46, we found significant
changes in the subcellular localization of Sirt1 in white matter
cells after neonatal HX. Extrinsic factors can alter subcellular
localization of Sirt1 (ref. 27), for example, cell culture conditions
promoting neuronal differentiation induce cytoplasmic–nuclear
translocation of Sirt1 (ref. 44). We found that under NX
conditions, Sirt1 was mostly localized in the nucleus, but HX
promoted subcellular translocation to the cytoplasm, where Sirt1
was found additionally to be localized in the mitochondrial
compartment. These findings suggest that nucleo-cytoplasmic
shuttling of Sirt1 and Sirt1–Rb co-localization play an important
role in HX-induced OPC proliferation. Since the predominantly
nuclear Sirt1 also regulates basal proliferation, it is possible
that HX-induced Sirt1 translocation need not be restricted
to proliferation, and suggests inclusion of metabolic targets,
including
mitofusin-2,
whose
deacetylation
regulates
mito-
chondrial function and cell death after ischaemic/reperfusion
injury59.
Our present study provides evidence for a novel regulatory
mechanism of OPC proliferation under normal and pathological
conditions,
demonstrating
that
Sirt1
regulates
both
Cdk2
signalling and Rb activity. Neonatal HX activates Cdk2, which
is essential for OPC proliferation in white matter after neonatal
injury14. Our analysis indicates that neonatal HX enhances Sirt1
activation in OPCs, which in turn promotes Cdk2 and Rb
deacetylation, and dissociation of the Rb/E2F1 complex. Release
of E2F1 from the Rb/E2F1 complex plays a crucial role in
maintaining OPC proliferation and preventing cell cycle exit.
Activation of the Cdk2/Rb/E2F1 pathway has been reported in
other animal models of pathology, in particular in frontal cortex
neurons after repeated electroconvulsive shock and in cerebellar
granule neurons after kainic acid treatment60. However, these
studies demonstrated activation of the Cdk2/Rb/E2F1 pathway in
neurons, but they did not establish a correlation with an
enhanced neuronal cell proliferation.
In our model of chronic neonatal HX, we show that different
Cdk/cyclin complexes are activated after injury and therefore
could be involved in post-HX OPC expansion. We demonstrate
formation of both Cdk2/Cyc E and Cdk1/Cyc E complexes
induced by neonatal HX. Cdk1 is the major binding partner of
Cyc B1, which regulates M phase checkpoint of the cell cycle61,
but Cdk1 could also function as the catalytic partner of Cyc E,

 particularly in the absence of Cdk2 (ref. 40). However, we found
that in the presence of Cdk2, both Cdk2/Cyc E and Cdk1/Cyc E
complexes are expressed, indicating that both kinases bind to Cyc
E in the normal developing white matter.
Our
results

that
post-translational
changes
in
individual members of the Cdk2 signalling pathway are regulated
by

activity

conditions.
Previous

demonstrated formation of a Sirt1/Cdk1 complex, and subse-
quent
phosphorylation
of
Sirt1
by
Cdk1
kinase,
whereas
other G1-associated kinases were not detected to interact with
Sirt1 (ref. 27). Our analysis strongly indicates that Sirt1 is a
previously
uncharacterized
substrate
of
Cdk2-mediated
phosphorylation, as shown by the loss of pSirt1 Ser47 after
Cdk2 knockdown and ablation. Similar to our data, it has been
shown that Cdk5 also phosphorylates Sirt1 at Serine 47 (ref. 62)
Sirt1 phosphorylation has been implicated in its stability28
and
translocation62,
but
its
multiple
kinases,
including
Jun-N-terminal kinase63 and mTOR64, suggest this site to be
related to substrate-specific functions in different contexts65.
Furthermore, our finding that Sirt1 phosphorylation is abolished
by sirtinol suggests the presence of feed-forward regulation of
Sirt1 via Cdk2 that is itself dependent on Sirt1 deacetylase
activity; this may provide modulation of Sirt1 output according to
target demand.
Our immunoprecipitation analysis suggests that both Cdk1
and Cdk2 might be involved in cell cycle progression in white
matter OPCs; however, only Cdk2 is deacetylated by Sirt1 in HX.
In the present study, we show that HX-induced NAD increase
activates
Sirt1
as
revealed
by
higher
Cdk2
deacetylation.
Hif1a elevated in HX upregulates expression of Sirt1, which is
upstream of Cdk2 and subsequently deacetylates Cdk2 in OPCs
through formation of a Sirt1/Cdk2 complex. We also show that
Sirt1
interacts
with
Rb,
which
is
deacetylated
after
HX.
These results are consistent with previous data demonstrating
NAD-dependent, Sirt-1-mediated Rb deacetylation in cultured
cell lines29.
On the basis of our findings that higher level of unbound E2F1
could be detected in white matter progenitors after HX,
we propose a molecular mechanism underlying OPC proliferation
and
pool
expansion
induced
by
neonatal
brain
injury
(Supplementary Fig. 10). Elevated Sirt1 activity induced by HX
and higher levels of NAD promotes Sirt1/Cdk2 interaction. This
causes deacetylation of Cdk2 by Sirt1 and of its phosphorylated
target, Rb. Deacetylation of Rb by Sirt1—as well as hyper-
phosphorylation of Rb by Cdk2—is required for dissociation of
the Rb/E2F1 complex and release of the transcription factor E2F1,
which promotes entry into S phase of the cell cycle. Sirt1 is in
turn phosphorylated by Cdk2, which may further regulate its
activity. Altogether, this sequence of events results in an elevated
number of proliferating OPCs in white matter after HX. Our
observation of Sirt1/Rb co-localization is consistent with Sirt1
and Rb nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling44,47.
Our study demonstrates a crucial functional role for the HDAC
Sirt1 in maintaining proliferation of the endogenous pool of
OPCs in the developing white matter. OPCs represent the major
and most abundant cell population involved in OL regeneration
and white matter recovery after injury14,66,67. We also define the
molecular mechanisms by which HX-induced elevation of NAD
stimulates Sirt1 deacetylase activity to promote injury-induced
OPC proliferation. In particular, we identify Sirt1 targets
within the Cdk2/Rb/E2F1 pathway. The finding that gain- and
loss-of-function
of
Sirt1—as
well
as
its
pharmacological
inhibition—alters OPC proliferation and their differentiation to
mature OLs indicates that Sirt1 may serve as a potential target
for therapeutic interventions promoting OL regeneration after
HX-induced neonatal brain injury.
Methods
Animals. The colonies of WT (C57BL/6, catalogue #003548, Jackson Laboratory),
CD1 (Crl:CD1(ICR), Charles River), CNP-EGFP (generated by Dr V. Gallo,
Children’s National Medical Center, Washington, DC), Sirt1F/F;PDGFRacreERT2;
RosaYFP–Sirt1-cKO, HIF1a KO mice (catalogue #008041 and #024640, respectively,
Jackson Laboratory) and Cdk2 KO mice were maintained in the animal facility of
the Children’s National Health System according to the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee and the National Institutes of Health guidelines. The VHLfl/fl
mice68 and PlpCreERT2 (ref. 69) mice were maintained in the UCSF animal facility
according to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the National
Institutes of Health guidelines. To change the genetic background, heterozygote
CNP-EGFP þ males were backcrossed to C57BL/6 females for more than eight
generations. To obtain mice in which the Sirt1 gene could be conditionally excised
in OPCs, we crossed Sirt1F/F mice (where lox sites flanked exon 4 of the Sirt1 gene)
with PDGFRacreERT2 transgenic mice (PDGFRacreERT2), which express the
tamoxifen-inducible form of Cre in OPCs expressing PDGFRa. To trace OPCs with
excised Sirt1, we crossed Sirt1F/F;PDGFRacreERT2 with mice carrying a fluorescent
reporter gene, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP). Cre/lox recombination
leads to the deletion of STOP sequence and expression of eYFP. Therefore,
tamoxifen injection induced both Sirt1 ablation and permanent eYFP expression in
OPCs. After birth, Sirt1-cKO mice were genotyped by PCR according to Jackson
Laboratory protocol. DNA products were loaded onto 2% agarose gels to resolve
the specific bands.
Hypoxia paradigm. All mice (3 days old, P3) were exposed to 9.5–10.5% oxygen
concentration in a HX chamber. To maintain HX conditions, nitrogen was added
to displace oxygen. Oxygen concentration was maintained and monitored
continuously with the sensor inside the chamber. To optimize nutrition during HX,
transgenic pups were housed in the chamber with two CD1 foster mothers and
their pups. At P11, mice were removed from the chamber and transferred to a
room with normoxic air conditions, remaining under the foster mothers’ care to
minimize stress. For all strains, exposure to HX lasted 8 consecutive days (P3–P11).
After removal from the HX chamber, mice were subjected all experimental
conditions at the specified time points. To abolish Sirt1 expression in OPCs, NX
and HX Sirt1-cKO mice were injected with tamoxifen intraperitoneally twice—at
P12 and P13 (50 mg per g of body weight each)—and then killed at P18.
Lysophosphatidylcholine-induced demyelination. Demyelination was performed
in adult (P40–P60) WT mice after deep ketamine/xylazine anaesthesia (10 mg per g
body weight). Mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame (Stoerling) and injected into
the CC with 2 ml of 1% lysophosphatidylcholine solution and/or 0.9% NaCl using
Hamilton micropipettes (Stoerling). Injection time lasted 5 min to reduce reflux
along the needle track. Stereotaxic coordinates for corpus callosum (CC) were
taken from bregma: 0.26 mm caudal; 1.0 mm lateral; and 2.5 mm ventral. The day
of injection was designated as day 0. Mice were processed for immunocytochem-
istry after lysophosphatidylcholine or control NaCl injections.
Immunocytochemistry and cell counting. Immunocytochemistry was performed
on floating sections using antibodies14 against the following antigens: NG2 (1:500;
Chemicon, AB5320); GFAP (1:1,000; Abcam ab4674-50); BrdU (1:200; Becton
Dickinson, 347580); Ki67 (1:250; NovoCastra, NCL-Ki67p); Olig2 (1:500; Abcam,
ab33437); Mash1 (1:400; BD Bioscience, 556604); CC1 (1:250; CalBiochem, OP80);
Sirt1 (1:250; Cell Signaling, 2028); Iba1 (1:500; WAKO, 019-19741); and CD38
(1:500; AbD Serotec MCA1957). Sections were incubated overnight at 4 �C in
primary antibodies diluted in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4), containing 0.1% Triton and 5%
normal goat serum. Appropriate secondary antibodies were used as follows:
TRITC-conjugated AffiniPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H þ L); FITC-conjugated
AffiniPure Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG; and TRITC-conjugated AffiniPure Goat
Anti-Mouse IgM (115-025-146, 111-095-008 and 115-025-020, respectively,
all from Jackson ImmunoResearch). Sections were incubated with secondary
antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and then mounted. Z-stacks of 1 mm-thick
optical sections through the entire thickness of slice were captured using a confocal
microscope (MRC1024, BioRad Laboratories) and collapsed along z axis before cell
counting. Measurements were taken from 7–12 tissue sections obtained from
3–4 mice in each group. The results are presented as a mean±s.e.m. and t-test was
performed to test the hypothesis of means’ equality.
Cell cultures. White matter was dissected from 300 mm-thick brain sections
obtained from NX and HX mice at P18, and digested in Hanks’ balanced salt
solution (Gibco, 14170-161) containing papain (13 units per ml, Sigma, T4762),
DNAse (5 units per ml, Sigma, D5427) and trypsin (Sigma, T4799) for 30 min at
37 �C. Cells were dissociated by trituration and resuspended in Hanks’ buffer
containing 1 M HEPES (BioSource, P305), 15% sucrose and penicilin/streptomycin.
Cells were then plated onto poly-L-lysine-coated dishes at a density of 10 cells
per ml, and cultured for 10 days in D-MEM/F-12 medium (Gibco, 11330-032),
supplemented with 1% N2 and 1% B27 (Gibco, 17502-048, 17504-044), and with
20 ng ml � 1 epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 10 ng ml � 1 basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF; Upstate Biotechnology, 01–407, 01–114). To immunolabel differ-
entiated cells, standard protocols were used14 with primary antibodies against GalC

 (Galactocerebroside), O4 and Olig2 (AB142, MAB345 and AB9610, respectively, all
from Chemicon).
To study Sirt1 activity, NX and HX cells from white matter were treated with
nicotinic acid riboside (Toronto Research Chemicals, N429400) or b-nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (Fisher Scientific, ICN10116801) for 24 h and then washed
out in control medium
To inhibit Sirt1 activity, 100 mm sirtinol (Calbiochem, 566321) has been added
to medium for 24 h. Then NX and HX cells were washed out of sirtinol and
cultured in medium with 20 ng ml � 1 EGF and 10 ng ml � 1 bFGF (Upstate
Biotechnology, 01–407, 01–114) for 8 days. For immunoprecipitation, cells were
lysed in RIPA buffer with protein inhibitors and then processed accordingly.
OPC cultures. Mouse OPCs were isolated and purified by immunopanning from
P7 mouse cerebral cortices, and then plated and maintained using previously
described methods37. Briefly, mouse cerebral cortical tissue underwent enzymatic
dissociation, and OPCs were isolated by depletion of microglia with BSL1, followed
by immunopanning for PDGFRa. Cells were maintained in proliferation conditions
with the addition of CNTF, PDGF and NT-3 (Peprotech) to base medium.
Tamoxifen (Sigma) was added to cultures at 24 h after plating and replenished
every other day in medium. OPCs were then collected in Trizol (Life
Technologies). RNA was isolated using phenol–chloroform purification followed
by the RNeasy mini kit with RNase-free DNase kit (Qiagen). cDNA was made
using a High Capacity cDNA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Applied Biosystems), and RT–PCR was performed. Samples were then run on a
2% agarose gel. Sirt1 bands were quantified using ImageJ for density and
normalized to GAPDH density.
Fluroescence-activated cell sorting. White matter was dissected from NX and
HX mice at P18. Isolated cell suspensions were FACS-purified as previously
described14 (Influx, Cytopeia, Seattle, WA). Briefly, tissue was dissocated in Hanks’
balanced salt solution containing 0.1% trypsin and 100 U ml � 1 DNase 1 (Sigma,
St Louis, MO) for 20 min. Following incubation with 0.7 mg ml � 1 trypsin inhibitor
(Sigma) and trituration, cell suspensions were analysed for light forward and side
scatter using a FACStar Plus instrument (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ).
After collection and washing with D-MEM/F12 medium, purified CNP-EGFP þ
cells were plated on 24-well dishes coated with poly-lysine at the density of 10 cells
per ml, and cultured in SCM (Stem Cell Technology, Inc.) containing 20 ng ml � 1
EGF and 10 ng ml � 1 bFGF (Upstate Biotechnology). To isolate NG2 þ
progenitors, cell suspensions obtained from NX and HX CNP-EGFP mice were
incubated with anti-NG2 antibody (1:1,000; Chemicon) for 1 h at 4 �C. Cells were
then washed twice in D-MEM/F12 medium and incubated with Alexa 647 (Jackson
Immunolaboratory) for 1 h at 4 �C. NG2 þ labelled cells were FACS-purified as
previously described (Influx, Cytopeia)14 by incubation with NG2 primary
antibodies and R-phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibodies.
Cell transfection with siRNA. Cell transfections were performed using the
NeuroPORTER Transfection reagent (Genlantis, T400750) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After white matter dissection, cells were plated in
12-well cell culture dishes at a density of 50 cells per ml for 24 h. At the time of
transfection, cell cultures were B60% confluent. Commercially available siRNA
directed against Sirt1 (Ambion, NM-009870), Cdk2 (Ambion, AM16704) and
Foxo3a (Ambion, AM16708) used at 20 pM produced selective gene knockdown at
7 h post transfection. Briefly, 2 ml of 20 pM siRNA solution and 12 ml of the
transfection reagent were incubated in 100 ml of OptiMEM medium (Gibco) for
20 min to facilitate complex formation. The siRNA transfection mix was added to
the cells cultured in 10% FBS. The control consisted of nonspecific siRNA (Silencer
Negative control No. 1, AM4635, Ambion). Cells were transfected for 7 h at 37 �C,
washed with Hanks’ buffer and cultured in MEM with 10% FBS for an additional
24 h. The medium was then changed to Stem Cell Medium (20 ng ml � 1 EGF and
10 ng ml � 1 FGF). To demonstrate Sirt1 knockdown, western blot analysis was
performed on transfected NX and HX cells using anti-Sirt1 antibody. To assess the
proliferative potential of cells, they were incubated in the presence of BrdU
(10 mg ml � 1) for 60 min at 37 �C. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
and kept in PBS until use. BrdU incorporation was visualized by immuno-
fluorescence using anti-mouse BrdU antibody and TRITC-conjugated AffiniPure
Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H þ L). Percentages of BrdU þ cells were quantified in
random fields captured under � 10 magnification (total of more than 250 cells)
from at least three different samples and subjected to statistical analysis.
Western blot and immunoprecipitation. White matter samples from NX and HX
mice were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer with proteinase inhibitors (Santa Cruz
Biotech, Inc., Sc 24948). Protein extracts were boiled for 5 min before loading onto
4–20% gradient gels (GeneMate, E4326-420, 20 mg of protein per each lane). Gels
were electrotransfered to a 0.2 mm nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore). Blots were
blocked in 5% milk in TBST for 1 h, and then incubated at 4 �C overnight with one
of the following antibodies: anti-Cdk1; -Cdk2; -Cdk4; -Cyc D; -Cyc E; -Cyc B; -Rb;
-pRb 807/811; -E2F1; -E2F2; Sirt1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-54, sc-6248,
sc-260, sc-25765, sc-48420, sc-166210, sc-50, sc-16670, sc-193, sc-633 and
sc-15404); pSirt ser47 and pSirt ser27 (Abcam, ab76039 and ab76029);
phospho-H3; acetylo-lysine (Cell Signaling 9681,9713); -actin (Chemicon, MAB
1501R); and -HIF1a antibody (Novus, NB100-123). Bands were detected with
appropriate horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibodies, reacted with
chemiluminescent ECL substrate (Amersham, RPN2132) and visualized by
exposure to X-ray-sensitive film. Band intensity was measured using the ImageJ
programme (NIH). Full western blots are available as Supplementary Figs 11
and 12.
For immunoprecipitation, white matter tissue extracts were prepared from NX
and HX mice at P18 in RIPA buffer containing 2%Triton X-100 and 0.2% SDS.
Aliquots (270 mg tissue) were incubated overnight with antibodies against various
antigens and 15 ml of agarose A (sc 2001, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Complexes
bound to agarose A were collected by centrifugation and washed twice in 500 ml of
RIPA buffer containing proteinase inhibitors. Precipitated proteins were analysed
by immunoblotting with antibodies against expected co-precipitating proteins.
Bands were detected by using horseradish peroxide-labelled polyclonal anti-mouse
or anti-rabbit antibodies (554002 and 554021, BD Biosciences) and developed with
a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL, Amersham).
Reverse transcriptase PCR. cDNA was first synthesized from 1.5–2 mg of total
RNA extracted from NX and HX cultured cells in the total volume of 11 ml,
including 10 mM dNTP mix and 0.5 mg ml � 1 Oligo dT (Invitrogen, 12371-019).
Reaction mixtures were heated at 65 �C for 5 min and then at 42 �C for 50 min.
From 2 ml of cDNAs, sequences of interest were amplified in a thermocycler in a
total volume of 25 ml of mixture with Tag Polymerase. Primer sequences are
provided as Supplementary Information. PCR products were resolved by vertical
electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. Band intensity was measured using ImageJ
programme (NIH). The sequences of primers were listed in Supplementary Table 1.
NAD quantification. NAD assay was performed on white matter tissue dissected
from NX and HX mice at P18 by using the NAD þ/NADH Quantification Kit
(BioVision K-337-100). A unit of 20 mg samples were taken for analysis, washed
with cold PBS, homogenized with 400 ml of NAD þ/NADH extraction buffer and
spun down at 14,000 r.p.m. for 5 min. To detect NADH only, NAD þ was
decomposed before the assay by heating samples to 60 �C for 30 min in a water
bath, and then cooling on ice. Precipitates were removed by centrifugation, and
NAD þ-decomposed samples were transferred to 96-well plates (50 ml volume in
duplicates). Both, total NAD þ/NADH and NADH-only samples were incubated
with detecting reagents. Standard curve dilutions were incubated with NAD þ
Cycling Mix (NAD þ Cycling buffer—100 ml and NAD þ Cycling enzyme
mix—2 ml), then 10 ml of NADH developer was added to each well, and samples
were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were read at 450 nm
wavelength. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 ml of stop solution to each
well and mixing. The standard curve was generated and the amount of the
nucleotides was calculated based on NAD þ/NADH and NADH-only readings.
The concentration of NAD þ/NADH ratio or NADH was expressed as ng per mg
protein or pmol/106.
HDAC fluorometric activity assay. HDAC activity assay was performed on
normoxic and hypoxic tissue. After tissue digestion (20 mg) in RIPA buffer, 25 ml of
HDAC Assay Buffer (Enzo, 100010996) was added to each well. The HDAC Assay
Buffer contained 0.2 mM trichostatin to inhibit histones class I and II, or 50 mM
nicotinamide to block sirtuins (class III). Then, extracts were incubated in
Fluor-de-Lys substrate in room temperature. After 15 min, 0.2 mM trichostatin
and 50 mM nicotinamide were added to each sample and samples were
quantified in a microtitre-plate fluorimeter (excitation 350–380 nm and detection
440–460 nm).
Statistical analysis. All animal experiments concern at least three animals.
Significance levels for comparison between groups were determined with unpaired
two-tailed Student’s t-test were appropriate, using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad
Software) or Excel (Microsoft). Quantifications are plotted as mean±s.e.m.
Unpaired Student’s two-tailed t-tests were used, with significance levels *Po0.05,
**Po0.01 and ***Po0.001. Use of other statistical tests is indicated in figure
legends. Statistics from western blot analysis and in vitro studies are included in
figure legends.
Data availability. All relevant data are available from the authors.
