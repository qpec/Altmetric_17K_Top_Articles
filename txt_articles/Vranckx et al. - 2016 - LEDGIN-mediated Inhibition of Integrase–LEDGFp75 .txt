Persistence of latent, replication-competent Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) provirus is the main
impediment towards a cure for HIV/AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). Therefore, different thera-
peutic strategies to eliminate the viral reservoirs are currently being explored. We here propose a novel strategy
to reduce the replicating HIV reservoir during primary HIV infection by means of drug-induced retargeting of HIV
integration. A novel class of integration inhibitors, referred to as LEDGINs, inhibit the interaction between HIV
integrase and the LEDGF/p75 host cofactor, the main determinant of lentiviral integration site selection. We
show for the first time that LEDGF/p75 depletion hampers HIV-1 reactivation in cell culture. Next we demon-
strate that LEDGINs relocate and retarget HIV integration resulting in a HIV reservoir that is refractory to reacti-
vation by different latency-reversing agents. Taken together, these results support the potential of integrase
inhibitors that modulate integration site targeting to reduce the likeliness of viral rebound.

1. Introduction
Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has revolutionized the
treatment of HIV/AIDS, turning a life-threatening disease into a chronic
illness. Yet, current therapies fail to cure infection due to the existence of
a reservoir of latently infected cells (Archin et al., 2014; Bruner et al.,
2015; Siliciano and Siliciano, 2015). While the Human Immunodeficien-
cy Virus type 1 (HIV-1) actively replicates in activated CD4+ T lympho-
cytes, it is able to reside in a long-lived quiescent state, mainly in resting
memory CD4+ T cells (Chun et al., 1997a,b; Finzi et al., 1997). This la-
tently infected cell population is established early on during infection
and consists of a small fraction of the resting CD4+ T cells in patients
(about 1 in 106 cells) (Chun et al., 1997a,b; Finzi et al., 1997). The reser-
voir enables HIV persistence during cART and is responsible for the re-
bound of viremia upon therapy cessation (Richman et al., 2009).
However, recent evidence suggests that persistent HIV-1 replication oc-
curs in lymphoid tissue reservoirs due to insufficient drug penetration
(Lorenzo-Redondo et al., 2016). Lentiviruses, such as HIV-1, preferen-
tially integrate into transcriptionally active units (Schroder et al.,
2002). The latter integration preference is retained in latently HIV-1 in-
fected primary CD4+ T cells from patients (Han et al., 2004; Liu et al.,
2006; Shan et al., 2011) and determined by Lens Epithelium-Derived
Growth Factor (LEDGF/p75), a host-cell cofactor binding HIV-1 IN via
its C-terminal protein binding domain (Integrase Binding Domain
(IBD)) (Cherepanov et al., 2003, 2005) and reading chromatin through
its PWWP domain (Eidahl et al., 2013; Pradeepa et al., 2012). LEDGF/
p75 depletion shifts lentiviral integration out of transcription units
(Ciuffi et al., 2005), a phenotype even more pronounced in human
LEDGF/p75 knockout (KO) cells (Fadel et al., 2014; Schrijvers et al.,
2012a; Shun et al., 2007). In the absence of LEDGF/p75, its paralogue
HRP-2 can at least in part take over this targeting role for HIV integra-
tion (Schrijvers et al., 2012a,b; Wang et al., 2012).
Structure-based drug design targeting the well-defined interface
(Cherepanov et al., 2005) between the IBD and the HIV-1 IN catalytic
core resulted in the development of 2-(quinolin-3-yl)acetic acid

 derivatives that inhibit HIV-1 replication (Christ et al., 2010). This novel
class of antivirals is referred to as LEDGINs (Christ and Debyser, 2013;
Christ et al., 2010, 2012; Debyser et al., 2015; Demeulemeester et al.,
2014a). Novel congeners with nanomolar activity act as allosteric inhib-
itors, preventing the binding of both LEDGF/p75 and HRP-2 and inter-
fering with the catalytic activity of IN (i.e. the so-called ‘early effect’)
(Christ et al., 2012; Kessl et al., 2012; Tsiang et al., 2012). Recently,
LEDGINs were found to inhibit late stage HIV replication as well (i.e.
the ‘late effect’) (Balakrishnan et al., 2013; Desimmie et al., 2013;
Jurado et al., 2013; Le Rouzic et al., 2013). The phenotype requires the
binding of LEDGINs to the LEDGF/p75 binding pocket in IN (Desimmie
et al., 2013; Le Rouzic et al., 2013) and is mediated by enhanced
multimerisation of IN in the viral particles (Balakrishnan et al., 2013;
Borrenberghs et al., 2014; Desimmie et al., 2013; Jurado et al., 2013).
Contradictory results have been obtained as to whether LEDGINs affect
the integration site distribution (Feng et al., 2016; Gupta et al., 2014;
Sharma et al., 2014). In any case LEDGIN treatment results in a steep
dose-dependent inhibition of viral replication in cell culture, supporting
their clinical development (Fader et al., 2014; Fenwick et al., 2014).
Here we investigated the early effect of LEDGINs and evaluated their
effect on HIV integration site distribution. In addition, we monitored the
effect of LEDGINs on the establishment of the latent reservoir and inves-
tigated whether retargeting of integration could lead to a silent HIV res-
ervoir resistant to reactivation. In a stepwise approach we first
demonstrate that LEDGF/p75 depletion results in reduced integration
and a quiescent state of residual integrants. Next, we demonstrate that
upon treatment with LEDGINs, blocking the LEDGF/p75–IN interaction,
the residual proviral integration shifts away from transcription units.
LEDGIN treatment also shifts the 3D localization of the integrated provi-
rus towards the inner nucleus. LEDGIN-induced retargeting results in a
silent HIV reservoir in cell lines and primary CD4+ cells. This silent res-
ervoir is refractory to reactivation by latency reversing agents (LRAs).
Pushing sufficient proviruses into latency is theoretically predicted to
drive the basic reproduction number of HIV below 1, resulting in unsus-
tainable infection (Rouzine et al., 2015). Hence, addition of LEDGINs to
cART regimens during acute HIV infection may represent a new strategy
to achieve a remission of HIV infection in patients.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Cell culture, Virus Production and Transduction
All cells were tested to be mycoplasma free. Cells were cultured in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. SupT1 (provided by
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Reagent Program, NIH, Bethesda,
MD). Nalm cells obtained from ATCC (Schrijvers et al., 2012a) were cul-
tured in RPMI medium (GIBCO-BRL) supplemented with 10% v/v heat
inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.01% v/v gentami-
cin (GIBCO). HEK293T cells (gift from O. Danos, Evry, France) were cul-
tured in Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, GIBCO) with 5% v/v
FCS (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.01% v/v gentamicin (GIBCO). U2OS cells
(ATTC) were cultured in DMEM (GIBCO) with 10% v/v FCS. Vesicular
stomatitis virus G (VSV-G)-pseudotyped viruses were generated by
double transfection of HEK293T cells with a plasmid encoding a single
round HIV clone (pNL4-3.tCD34.R-.E-, pOGH, pOGH-csGFP-only or
pOGH-mKO2-only) together with a VSV-G protein encoding plasmid
(pVSVG). In other experiments triple transfection was done with the
transfer plasmid pHR-CMV-GFP-I-Sce1 together with the Δ8.91 packag-
ing plasmid and pVSVG. Linear polyethylenimine (PEI; Polysciences)
was used for plasmid transfections. Medium was replaced 6 h post
transfection and supernatant collected after 72 h by filtration through
a 0.22 μm pore membrane (Corning Inc.). The virus was concentrated
using a Vivaspin 15–50 kDa cut-off column (Vivascience), DNase
(Roche) treated and stored at −80 °C. The HR vectors were concentrat-
ed by 2 h of ultracentrifugation in a 20% sucrose cushion. Cells were
seeded and infected for 3 days in 48-well plates (10% FCS, 0.01%
gentamicin RPMI) yielding an infection rate b 40% positive cells, as mon-
itored by FACS analysis using a MACS Quant VYB FACS analyzer
(Miltenyi Biotech GmbH), ensuring single-copy integration. Cells were
washed twice in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) 72 h post infection
to remove residual virus and reseeded. FACS samples were taken
every 2 days to monitor reporter gene expression. A SIV-based lentiviral
vector carrying a spleen focus forming viral (SFFV) promoter driving a
zeocin resistance gene and a LEDGF/p75 specific miRNA-based shRNA
(Osório et al., 2014; Schrijvers et al., 2012a) was used to generate a
SupT1 LEDGF/p75 knock down (KD) cell line. LEDGF/p75 depletion
was monitored using Western blot and Q-PCR (N85% in SupT1 LEDGF/
p75 KD cells, Supplementary Fig. 1a bottom panel). Nalm LEDGF/p75
control (+/c) and LEDGF/p75 KO cells (−/−) were generated previous-
ly and are described in (Schrijvers et al., 2012a).
2.2. Reporter Viruses
2.2.1. Multi-colored Reporter Vvirus (OGH)
A variant of the recently described LAI-based double reporter virus
was used (Chavez et al., 2015), where a constitutive and a LTR-driven
reporter are simultaneously measured to study the latent reservoir
(Calvanese et al., 2013; Dahabieh et al., 2013). This orange-green HIV-
1 (OGH) reporter virus variant encodes LTR-driven enhanced Green
Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) in the nef gene position together with a con-
stitutively active EF1alpha promoter driving mutant Kusabira-Orange2
(mKO2) expression instead of mCherry as described previously
(Calvanese et al., 2013; Chavez et al., 2015) (Fig. 1a). An internal consti-
tutive promoter driving mKO2 expression allows direct visualization of
the LTR-silent latent proviral pool via the FACS measurement of mKO2-
based red fluorescence.
2.2.2. HIV NL4-3.tCD34.R−.E−
HIV tCD34 is a NL4.3-based single round reporter virus containing
the LTR driven truncated CD34 (tCD34) as a reporter protein in the nef
gene position (Fig. 2a). We replaced the firefly luciferase gene in
pNL4-3.Luc.R−.E− (NIH aids reagent program) via NotI–XhoI digestion
with a tCD34 cassette using standard PCR amplification methods.
CD34 (cluster of differentiation 34) is a cell surface glycoprotein func-
tioning as a cell-cell adhesion factor in HSCs but is not present on prima-
ry CD4+ T lymphocytes (Fehse et al., 2000). A truncated version was
used to block signal transduction and expression was visualized using
antibody-staining allowing for non-fluorescent based cell sorting.
Human CD34-PE antibody (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat. No 130-081-002) was
used to detect tCD34 expression.
2.3. Flow Cytometry Analysis
Prior to flow cytometry, cells were fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformal-
dehyde at room temperature. Expression of eGFP/mKO2 or tCD34 was
monitored using a MACS Quant VYB FACS analyzer (Miltenyi Biotech
GmbH) using a 488 nm, 50 mW DPSS (diode-pumped solid-state) and
a 561 nm, 100 mW diode laser respectively and 525/50 nm–586/
15 nm band pass filters. A total of at least 30,000 live cells were counted,
as determined on the basis of forward scatter channel/side scatter chan-
nel (FSC-H/SSC-H) and doublets were excluded based on the FSC-A/
FSC-H or SSC-A/SSC-H plot. Single reporter controls where used for
compensation purposes. Data were analyzed using third party software
(FlowJo).
2.4. Drug Treatment
The LEDGIN CX014442 (Christ et al., 2012) was added at different
concentrations during single round infection and washed away together
with residual virus 72 h post infection. Samples were harvested for FACS
analysis and the remainder of infected cells was reseeded. FACS samples
were taken every 2 days to monitor reporter gene expression. The
249
L.S. Vranckx et al. / EBioMedicine 8 (2016) 248–264
 infected cells were reactivated from latency 11 days post infection using
Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα, 10 ng/mL, Immunosource),
suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, 0.3 to 3 μM, AIDS reagents),
Prostratin (5 μM, AIDS reagents) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA, 0.3 μM, AIDS reagents) 24 h prior to analysis by flow cytometry.
Time courses and drug concentrations are indicated in the individual
experiments. LEDGINs were synthesized at Cistim/CD3 KU Leuven
(courtesy of Dr. A. Marchand).
2.5. Genomic DNA Isolation and Quantification of Integrated Copy Number
Two million cells were pelleted and genomic DNA extracted using
a mammalian genomic DNA miniprep kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Standard
spectrophotometric methods were used to determine the genomic
DNA concentration. Samples corresponding to 250 ng genomic
DNA were used for analysis. Each reaction contained 12.5 μL iQ
Supermix (Biorad), 40 nmol/L forward and reverse primer (5′
TGCACCCTGTGTCTCAACAT 3′ and 5′ GGCTTCAAGGTTGTCTCTGG 3′
respectively)
and
40
nmol/L
of
tCD34
probe
(5′
(6FAM)-
GGCCACAACAAACATCACAG-(TAM) 3′) in a final volume of 25 μL. In
all cases, RNaseP was used as an endogenous control for normaliza-
tion (TaqMan RNaseP control reagent, Applied Biosystems, The
Netherlands). Samples were run in triplicate for 3 min at 95 °C
followed by 50 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 55 °C in a LightCycler
480 (Roche-applied-science). Analysis was performed using the
LightCycler 480 software.
2.6. Integration Site Amplification
Integration sites were determined as described previously (Marshall
et al., 2007). In short, cells were seeded and transduced with a lentiviral
vector for 3 days, then washed twice with PBS. Transduced cells were
further cultivated for at least 10 days to eliminate non-integrated
DNA. Cells were harvested and genomic DNA extracted using the
GenElute Mammalian Genomic DNA miniprep kit (Sigma-Aldrich). In-
tegration sites were amplified by linker-mediated PCR as described pre-
viously (Marshall et al., 2007). Genomic DNA was fragmented using
MseI restriction digestion and linkers ligated. Provirus/host genome
junctions were amplified by nested PCR using indexed primers. Prod-
ucts were gel-purified and sequenced using 454/Roche pyrosequencing
(Titanium technology, Roche) on the 454 GS-FLX-instrument. Reads
were filtered based on perfect matching of the LTR linker, barcode and
flanking LTR. All sites were mapped to the human reference genome re-
quiring a perfect match within 3 bp of the LTR end. Matched Random
Control (MRC) sites were computationally generated and matched to
experimental sites with respect to the distance to the nearest MseI
cleavage site. Normalization of experimental HIV sites by the MRC
sites corrects for the recovery bias due to cleavage by MseI. Analysis
was performed as described previously (Marshall et al., 2007). A more
detailed guide to the data presented can be found in (Ocwieja et al.,
2011). Sequence logos were created using WebLogo 3.3 with composi-
tional adjustment for the human genome base background distribution.
2.7. Single Cell Imaging of Proviral HIV (SCIP) Assay
20,000 U2OS cells/well were seeded in a 4 well chamber slides (Lab-
TekTM) and transfected the next day with 200 ng of pCBASce plasmid
encoding the I-Sce1 endonuclease using Effectene (Qiagen). Six hours
post transfection cells were infected with 4 reverse transcriptase units
(RTUs; SYBR Green-based Product Enhanced Reverse Transcriptase
assay, SGPERT; (Pizzato et al., 2009) of the lentiviral vectors HR-CMV-
GFP-I-SceI/VSV-G or HR CMV-GFP-I-Sce1-INA128T/E170G/VSV-G in
Optimem medium containing 1% FCS for 2 h and fixed 48 h post infec-
tion with 4.0% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min at room temperature
(RT). After permeabilization with PBS containing 0.2% Triton-X100 for
10 min, samples were blocked overnight with 3% bovine serum albumin
at 4 °C. The slides were incubated with the primary antibody directed
against phosphorylated γH2AX (1:500, 05-636 Millipore) for 1 h at
RT and with secondary fluorophore-conjugated antibodies for 1 h
at RT. Slides were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium
(Vector Laboratories). Nuclear fluorescent signal from γH2AX foci
was acquired with the TCS SL laser-scanning confocal microscope
(Leica Microsystems) equipped with galvanometric stage using a
63×/1.4 NA HCX PL APO oil immersion objective and processed by
an image software (ImageJ, NIH.gov) (Di Primio et al., 2013). Back-
ground, i.e. spontaneous H2AX repair foci, were subtracted before
further analysis as described in (Di Primio et al., 2013).
2.8. CD4+ T-cell Enrichment
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), obtained from
the Red Cross Blood transfusion Center (Mechelen, Belgium) according
to
approved
bioethical
guidelines
of
our
institute
(S57175-
IRB00002047), were purified from fresh buffy coats using lymphoprep
density gradient centrifugation (Stem cell technologies). The CD4 +
T cells were selectively enriched using Bi-specific MAb CD3.8
(0.5 μg/mL, AIDS reagents) for 5 days. Cells were cultured in RPMI
1640, 15% v/v FBS, 0.1% v/v Gentamicin, 100 U/mL IL-2 (Peprotech)
(T-cell medium, TCM). Enriched total CD4+ primary T cells were infect-
ed with single round reporter virus for 2 h at 37 °C, washed twice in TCM
and reseeded in medium containing different concentrations of LEDGIN
CX014442. HIV infection was monitored 48 h post infection using flow
cytometry analysis.
2.9. Reactivation of Latent Provirus in Primary CD4+ T-cells
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from
fresh buffy coats obtained from the Red Cross Blood transfusion center
(Mechelen, Belgium) according to approved bioethical guidelines of
our institute (S57175-IRB00002047). Resting CD4+ T cells were puri-
fied using a custom-made EasySep negative selection kit (Stem Cell
Technologies; 19052 cocktail, with the addition of CD25, CD69, and
HLA-DR antibodies (catalogue number 19309VK)). The resulting
95% pure resting CD4+ T cells consisted of both naïve and central mem-
ory T cells (Sallusto et al., 1999). These freshly isolated resting CD4+ T
cells were activated with 10 μg/mL PHA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 U/mL
IL-2 (Peprotech) for 2 days before infecting with NL4.3 wt virus for 2 h
(3.5 × 103 ng p24 per 1 × 107 cells/mL). Cells were washed twice with
PBS and reseeded in the presence of varying concentrations of LEDGIN
(CX014442) and 1 U/mL of IL-2. Four days post-infection cells were
washed twice using PBS and some cells were harvested for quantifica-
tion of integrated proviral DNA using real time PCR (nested Alu-LTR
PCR, (Butler et al., 2001; Lewin et al., 2008) normalized for input DNA
by qPCR for the CCR5 gene as previously described (Zhang et al.,
1999). Other cells were reseeded in the presence of 10 nM PMA
(Sigma-Aldrich) together with 10 μg/mL PHA (Sigma-Aldrich) or left
untreated. PHA activated feeder peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) were added 24 h after the activating stimulus to amplify
virus replication and enhance detection of the infection (Saleh et al.,
2011). Virus production was measured in culture supernatant at day
7 post-infection by p24 ELISA (Fujirebio Europe).
2.10. Statistical Analysis
Reactivation results are expressed as means ± standard error of the
mean. Statistical analysis was assessed using multiple t tests and
corrected using Sidak–Bonferroni with significance levels indicated.
Ranked Wald statistics were used to calculate the statistical significance
(asterisks) for a given genomic feature between integration site datasets
relative to the DMSO treated condition (dashes). Significant deviation

 from the DMSO treated control dataset for safe harbor criteria was calcu-
lated using a Pearson's Chi-square test. ImageJ software was used to
measure the relative distance of γH2AX foci to the nuclear rim. Statistical
differences were calculated using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test as de-
scribed previously (Di Primio et al., 2013).
3. Results
3.1. LEDGF/p75 Depletion Results in a Quiescent Reservoir
We and others reported on retargeted proviral integration in LEDGF/
p75-depleted cells (Ciuffi et al., 2005; Fadel et al., 2014; Schrijvers et al.,
2012a; Shun et al., 2007). To study the role of LEDGF/p75 in establishing
the latent reservoir, we used a variant of the recently developed double
reporter virus that simultaneously measures a constitutive and a LTR-
driven reporter (see the Materials and Methods section, Fig. 1a,
(Calvanese et al., 2013; Chavez et al., 2015)). This orange-green HIV-1
(OGH) single-round reporter virus carries LTR-driven enhanced Green
Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) together with a constitutively active
EF1alpha promoter driving monomeric Kusabira-Orange2 (mKO2) ex-
pression (Fig. 1a). The double-fluorescent reporter virus allows quanti-
fication of distinct populations in the infected cell pool via FACS
(Fig. 1b). Through the constitutively active EF1α promoter all infected
cells express the mKO2 reporter. Provirus with an active LTR also ex-
presses the eGFP reporter and is referred to as double positive, active
virus, whereas provirus with a quiescent LTR does not express eGFP
and is called here upon the quiescent provirus. Wild type and LEDGF/
p75-depleted SupT1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1a, bottom panel) were
infected with a dilution series of single-round OGH virus. The percent-
age of infected cells was evaluated at three days post infection, discrim-
inating productively infected cells (active provirus; eGFP+, mKO2+)
from the latently infected populations (quiescent provirus; eGFP−,
mKO2+). Single reporter constructs were used for validation (Fig. 1b).
As expected, LEDGF/p75-depletion reduced HIV-1 infection 2- to 3-
fold as judged by the percentage mKO2 positive cells (Supplementary
Fig. 1a), in line with earlier data (Gijsbers et al., 2009; Schrijvers et al.,
2012a; Vandekerckhove et al., 2006). Evaluation of the percentage of
eGFP−, mKO2+ cells relative to the total number of infected cells
(mKO2+) provides an estimate of the fraction of quiescently infected
cells in the infected pool (% eGFP−, mKO2+ cells) / (% mKO2+
cells) ∗ 100. At all virus dilutions tested, LEDGF/p75 depleted cells
contained more quiescent proviruses than WT cells (Fig. 1c). When
this experiment was repeated in the Nalm+/c control and Nalm−/−
LEDGF/p75 KO cell lines (Schrijvers et al., 2012a), similar effects were
observed (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). Since LEDGF/p75 depletion results
in redistribution of HIV integration (Ciuffi et al., 2005; Fadel et al., 2014;
Schrijvers et al., 2012a; Shun et al., 2007), these results suggest that the
altered integration site distribution after LEDGF/p75 depletion increases
the transcriptionally quiescent fraction.
3.2. LEDGF/p75 Depletion Decreases the Reactivation Potential of the
Quiescent Reservoir
To further characterize the latently infected cell pool that is generat-
ed in LEDGF/p75-depleted cells, we set out to reactivate the latent pro-
virus using different LRAs. Here, we used the LEDGF/p75 KO cell line
(Nalm−/−) to study whether latent provirus in LEDGF/p75-depleted
cells has an altered reactivation potential. We made use of a NL4.3-
based single reporter virus containing an LTR driven truncated CD34
(tCD34) as a reporter protein (NL4-3.tCD34.R-.E-/VSV-G, Fig. 2a).
Control (Nalm+/c) and LEDGF/p75 KO (Nalm−/−) cells were infected
with a dilution series of HIV-tCD34. Virus dilutions were selected to re-
sult in equal integrated copy numbers, both the LEDGF/p75 control
(Nalm+/c) (1.45E−01 ± 1.40E−02 copies) and LEDGF/p75 KO
(Nalm−/−) cells (1.45E−01 ± 2.41E−02 copies) to compare the fold
reactivation between both. Cells were reactivated 11 days post infection
with different LRAs (Fig. 2b), and the fold reactivation (% tCD34) relative
to DMSO between LEDGF/p75 WT and LEDGF/p75 KO conditions was
measured 24 h later. The percentage of living cells amounted at least
75% of the total cell population in all conditions and was independent
of LEDGF/p75 depletion (data not shown). Modest tCD34 reactivation
was observed after addition of Phorbol Myristate Acetate (PMA) or
Prostratin. An increase in the percentage tCD34 positive cells of 1.5–2
fold was observed for the Nalm+/c control while LEDGF/p75 KO
(Nalm−/−) conditions only experienced an increase of 1.3–1.5 fold
when adding PMA (0.3–3 μM) or Prostratin (5 μM) (t-test with
Sidak–Bonferroni correction; * p b 0.05, control compared to
LEDGF/p75 KO). A similar effect was observed when stimulating
with 1 μM Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic acid (SAHA). Yet, addition
of 3 μM of SAHA resulted in a 3.2-fold reactivation of tCD34 in the
presence of LEDGF/p75 but only a 2.2-fold reactivation in its absence
(t-test with Sidak–Bonferroni correction; ** p b 0.005, WT compared
to LEDGF/p75 KO) (Fig. 2b). Together, these data indicate that inte-
gration in the absence of LEDGF/p75 results in a larger quiescent
cell pool upon infection (Fig. 1c) with a relatively larger proportion
of cells refractory to reactivation (Fig. 2b).
3.3. LEDGIN Treatment Shifts HIV Integration Out of Transcription Units
Next, we evaluated the effect of recently developed LEDGINs, small
molecules that inhibit LEDGF/p75–IN interaction and HIV integration
(Christ et al., 2010; Demeulemeester et al., 2014a), on the HIV reservoir
in cell culture. SupT1 cells were transduced with a single-round HIV-
based lentiviral vector expressing eGFP in the presence of a dilution
series of LEDGIN CX014442 (Christ et al., 2012). Flow cytometry and
Q-PCR revealed a dose-dependent decrease in lentiviral transduction
as represented by the % eGFP-positive cells and the number of inte-
grated copies (Supplementary Fig. 2a and b). In a first step, we deter-
mined the distribution of HIV-based viral vector integration sites
(Gijsbers et al., 2009; Marshall et al., 2007). The number of integra-
tion sites is indicated for each data set (Table 1, Fig. 3). We analyzed
lentiviral integration frequencies relative to a set of genomic features
(Table 1). In line with previous results, HIV integration in WT SupT1
cells was enriched in the body of genes (69.54% in RefSeq genes
(Table 1)) disfavoring transcription start sites (TSS) and promoter
regions (1.78% within 2 kb of the 5′ of a RefSeq gene and 2.02% within
2 kb of a CpG island) (Mitchell et al., 2004; Schroder et al., 2002). The
integration sites shifted out of transcription units under LEDGIN-
treatment (54.55% in RefSeq genes (50 μM); *** p b 0.0001, Chi-
square test compared to DMSO) while integration close to TSS
(6.94% (50 μM); *** p b 0.0001, Chi-square test compared to DMSO)
and CpG islands (5.50% (50 μM); ** p b 0.01, Chi-square test com-
pared to DMSO) increased in a dose-dependent manner. This shift
in integration site distribution surpasses the one observed in LEDGF/
p75-depleted cells (Ciuffi et al., 2005; Fadel et al., 2014; Schrijvers et
al., 2012a; Shun et al., 2007). The fact that LEDGINs also inhibit the in-
teraction between HRP-2 and HIV-1 IN (Schrijvers et al., 2012a), can ex-
plain this observation. Comparable data were observed for larger
window sizes (2 kb and 4 kb are shown). Our results were corroborated
in MT4 cells using multiple round (WT) HIV NL4-3 using the less potent

 LEDGIN CX05045 (Supplementary Table 1) (Christ et al., 2010). A geno-
mic heat map comparing integration site data sets obtained in SupT1
LEDGF/p75 KD cells with WT SupT1 cells in the presence of various con-
centrations of LEDGIN is shown in Fig. 3. Analysis of global integration
preferences clearly indicates a shifts out of transcriptionally active re-
gions upon LEDGF/p75 KD (Fig. 3, compared to DMSO), in line with pre-
viously reported data (Gijsbers et al., 2009; Marshall et al., 2007; Shun
et al., 2007). A similar shift was also observed under LEDGIN treatment
at concentrations above 6 μM. In a more elaborate analysis we analyzed
integration site frequencies relative to epigenetic features described in T
cells (Supplementary Fig. 3b & c). Under WT conditions, HIV integration
preferentially occurred near epigenetic markers associated with tran-
scriptionally active regions (H3K4 mono-, di- and tri methylation,
H3K14 and H4 acetylation, as well as acetylation or mono-methyla-
tion of H3K9/K27/K79, H4K20 and H2BK5, …) (De Ravin et al.,
2014), while integration in transcriptionally silent regions or hetero-
chromatin is disfavored (H3K27me3, H3K9me3 or H4K20me3 and
H3K79me3, respectively). The overall integration profile is closer to
random upon addition of LEDGIN CX014442 (as shown by the decrease
in color intensity towards black, cf. Color key Supplementary Fig. 3b and
c). Supplementary Fig. 3c displays a more condensed heat map where
epigenetic marks are grouped according to the respective chromatin
states they associate with.
Since LEDGINs may potentially affect the inherent integration
mechanism, resulting in aberrant integration or an altered local in-
tegration site preference, we evaluated sequence conservation and
relative base frequency in the 18 bp genomic DNA sequence sur-
rounding the integration sites (corresponding to the intasome
footprint) using sequence logos (Supplementary Fig. 5). The WT
local palindromic sequence logo surrounding the integration site
(Holman and Coffin, 2005; Demeulemeester et al., 2014b)) was
maintained in all conditions. In addition we calculated the percent-
age unique integration sites with an imperfect LTR chromosome
junction relative to the total integration sites after LEDGIN

dilution series of single round reporter virus and the % tCD34 positive cells was monitored. 11 days post infection cells were reactivated using different LRAs at concentrations indicated.
Data represent averages of 9 replicates from 3 independent experiments and error bars indicate the standard error of the mean (SEM). A statistical analysis was performed using multiple t
tests and corrected using Sidak–Bonferroni (* p b 0.05, ** p b 0.005 vs. LEDGF/p75 KO) (SAHA; Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid, PMA; Phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate, Prostratin, DMSO;
Dimethyl sulfoxide.). Normalization was based on equal integrated copy (IC) numbers. All viruses are VSV-G pseudotyped. tCD34; truncated Cluster of Differentiation 34.

 treatment (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 6, Sup-
plementary experimental procedures). Only a minor fraction (b2%)
of the total integration sites was identified as containing imperfect
LTR-chromosome junctions. We conclude that although LEDGINs
retarget integration towards more random, residual integration
events represent authentic integration without gross LTR deletions.
3.4. Abrogation of LEDGF/p75–IN Interaction Shifts 3D Localization of the
Integrated Provirus Towards the Inner Nuclear Compartment
HIV-1 PICs and integrated HIV provirus preferentially localize in the
nuclear periphery (Albanese et al., 2008; Di Primio et al., 2013; Francis
et al., 2014). Recent reports associate preferential integration with nu-
clear import and distance to nuclear pore complexes (Lelek et al.,
2015; Marini et al., 2015). Here we analyzed the 3D distribution of
HIV-1 integrated provirus upon interruption of the LEDGF/p75–IN inter-
action. We first compared the distribution of HIV proviruses 48 h post
infection in the Single Cell Imaging of Proviral HIV-1 assay (SCIP) (Di
Primio et al., 2013) between LEDGF/p75 WT and LEDGF/p75 depleted
U2OS cells (Fig. 4a). The distribution of integrated HIV provirus was an-
alyzed by detection of γH2AX foci after I-Sce1 digestion (Fig. 4a). Two-
fold less integrants were detected after LEDGF/p75 depletion (Fig. 4a).
Whereas in WT cells the viral genomes localized near the nuclear rim
(Fig. 4b), the location of integrated provirus shifted towards the inner
nuclear compartment after LEDGF/p75 depletion as indicated by the cu-
mulative frequency plotted relative to the distance to the nuclear rim
(Fig. 4b) confirming recent observations (Di Primio et al., 2013; Lelek
et al., 2015; Marini et al., 2015). Since LEDGIN treatment shifts integra-
tion sites out of transcriptionally active regions comparable to LEDGF/
p75 KD conditions (Fig. 3), we verified whether LEDGIN treatment
might potentially affect the 3D-location of integrated provirus as well.
Indeed, addition of 3 μM of LEDGIN CX05045 redistributed the integrat-
ed provirus towards the inner nuclear compartment. An HIV-1 mutant
(HIV-IN-A128T/E170G), resistant to LEDGINs (Christ et al., 2010), was
not redistributed (Fig. 4d). Therefore, these data demonstrate that
LEDGF/p75 controls the nuclear topology of HIV-1 provirus and that
LEDGINs may induce its spatial randomization.
3.5. The residual reservoir upon LEDGIN treatment is more quiescent
In a next step, we investigated whether LEDGIN-mediated
retargeting also affected the quiescent reservoir, which would be in
line with the effects demonstrated earlier in LEDGF/p75 depleted (KD/
KO) cells. SupT1 cells were infected with the single-round OGH reporter
virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of LEDGIN
(CX014442). HIV OGH infection was measured 3 days post infection
using flow cytometry resulting in the detection of cell populations car-
rying both productive (eGFP+, mKO2+ cells) and quiescent (eGFP−,
mKO2+ cells) provirus (see also Fig. 1). LEDGIN treatment induced a
dose-dependent decrease in the % of eGFP+, mKO2+ cells (Fig. 5a) as
well as the overall mKO2+ cells (Fig. 5b). However, similar to LEDGF/
p75 depletion (see Fig. 1c), LEDGIN treatment resulted in a relative in-
crease of the quiescent fraction (% eGFP−, mKO2+ cells) / (% mKO2+
cells) ∗ 100 (Fig. 5c). No increase in the quiescent fraction was observed
when adding increasing concentrations of the reverse transcriptase in-
hibitor AZT (data not shown) suggesting the phenotype was not merely
due to inhibition of infection. Interestingly, nearly all infected cells were
quiescent at 25 μM LEDGIN (CX014442). Several studies reported on the
effect of integration orientation relative to endogenous genes on the HIV
transcriptional state, with a possible enhancement of transcription
when integrated in the same orientation or transcriptional interference
when integrated in the opposite orientation. We therefore evaluated
relative orientation frequencies of those integrations occurring within
genes for the different integration site data sets (Supplementary Table
3). LEDGIN treatment resulted in a significant, dose-dependent increase
in the fraction of integrations having an opposite orientation from 46.2%

3.6. LEDGIN Treatment Results in a Quiescent Reservoir Resistant to HIV
Reactivation
Next we studied whether LEDGIN treatment also reduces the reacti-
vation potential after reporter gene silencing, as observed under LEDGF/
p75 depletion (Fig. 2). The LEDGIN-induced increase in the silent reser-
voir, together with the reduced HIV reactivation potential could hold
promise to reduce the functional reservoir. SupT1 cells were infected
with single round HIV-OGH double reporter virus (Fig. 6) or HIV-
tCD34 (Supplementary Fig. 4) under varying LEDGIN (CX014442) con-
centrations and reactivated with LRAs. To demonstrate that LEDGIN-
retargeted provirus remains refractory to general cell activation TNFα
was used as a reactivation agent. Data depict a representative virus dilu-
tion. In Fig. 6a the percentage of eGFP+, mKO2+ cells and overall %
mKO2+ positive cells is plotted after stimulation with DMSO or TNFα
for 24 h (open squares and open triangles, for TNFα and DMSO, respec-
tively). Stimulation with TNFα did not affect the percentage living cells
(N85% in all conditions) neither in the absence or presence of LEDGIN
(data not shown). The % eGFP+, mKO2+ positive cells are significantly
higher after stimulation with TNFα compared to DMSO at the different
LEDGIN concentrations, while the overall percentages of mKO2+ posi-
tive cells remain constant (compare red and green lines). LEDGIN treat-
ment resulted in reduced reactivation as measured by the fold increase
of productively infected cells (% eGFP+, mKO2+) in a concentration-de-
pendent manner, with 25 μM CX014442 reducing the reactivation by
TNFα 2-fold (Fig. 6b). A slope of −0.034 ± 0.009 fold/μM was calculat-
ed using a linear regression model (significant deviation from zero;
p b 0.0018, Fig. 6b). On the other hand, increasing concentrations of
LEDGIN CX014442 antagonized the reactivation potential of the latently
infected pool as represented by the decrease the fraction of quiescent
cells (% eGFP−, mKO2+ cells) / (% mKO2+ cells ) ∗ 100 (Fig. 6c). A

different concentrations of CX014442 (IC50 CX014442 ‘early effect’: 3.83 μM) were compared to different genomic features. A heat map was generated using the INSIPID software
(Bushman Lab, University of Pennsylvania). Tile color depicting the nature of the correlation for an integration data set with the respective genomic/epigenetic feature (rows, left)

sets. Statistical significance (asterisks, ranked Wald tests) is shown relative to the DMSO population (dashes). Significance is reached when p b 0.001, compared to the DMSO control
(** p b 0.01; *** p b 0.001). CX014442 treatment during infection shows a dose dependent shift out of transcriptionally active regions. Lower significance is observed at the highest
LEDGIN concentrations due to a lower copy number of integration sites (a more detailed guide to the data presented can be found in Ocwieja et al., 2011).

 slope of −0.93 ± 0.08%/μM was calculated using a linear regression
model (significant deviation from zero; p b 0.0001, Fig. 6c). Similar
results were observed for HIV-tCD34 where LEDGIN (CX014442) treat-
ment resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of reactivation from latency
(reactivation IC50 ≈ 7.24 μM) as evidenced by the reduced increase in the
% tCD34 positive cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a & b). This inhibition of reac-
tivation was seen with various LRAs (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Raltegravir
treatment did not result in this phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 4c & d),
excluding integration inhibition as such or an increase in non-integrated
2-LTR circles as the cause of this effect. In conclusion, LEDGIN treatment
reduces the reactivation potential of the quiescent HIV pool.
3.7. LEDGIN Treatment Retargets HIV Integration Into Safer Locations
The strategy to push HIV into latency by retargeting provirus inte-
gration away from active transcription units due to uncoupling of the
LEDGF/p75–IN interaction may be associated with an altered risk of in-
sertional mutagenesis. Insertional mutagenesis due to deregulation of
neighboring gene expression is a concern in gene therapy applications
with lentiviral vectors (Cavazzana-Calvo et al., 2010). In addition, two
studies revealed the existence of clonally expanded CD4+ cell popula-
tions carrying integrated HIV provirus in HIV-1 patients on prolonged
antiretroviral therapy (Maldarelli et al., 2014; Wagner et al., 2014).
Therefore we evaluated whether the residual integration profile under
LEDGIN treatment has a different “safety” profile using stringent criteria
used in gene therapeutic applications (Papapetrou et al., 2011). We in-
vestigated following criteria defining potentially unsafe integration
events: integration near transcription start sites (b50 kb), oncogenes
(b300 kb) or miRNA coding regions (b300 kb) and integration into
transcription units and ultraconserved elements (UCR). Integration
events occurring outside these features are considered to be safe
(Table 2) (Papapetrou et al., 2011). For each data set, we calculated
Fig. 5. LEDGIN-mediated retargeting of integration increases the quiescent reservoir. SupT1 cells were infected with three different dilutions of HIV OGH (a) Dose–response curve showing
a decrease in % eGFP+, mKO2+ cells with increasing LEDGIN concentration. Three different virus concentrations are depicted in green. (b) Dose–response curve showing a decrease in the

 the percentage of potentially unsafe integration sites according to a
given criterion (Table 2) and determined the final percentage of safe
sites (positioning outside these regions). The most pronounced and
dose dependent decrease was observed for integrations falling within
transcription units. For the calculation of the final % safe-sites all 5
criteria were taken into account and the risk analysis is therefore
affected by the different parameters. In the parental SupT1 cell line
only 10.7% of all vector integration sites can be considered safe in
258
L.S. Vranckx et al. / EBioMedicine 8 (2016) 248–264
 comparison to 28.5% for the matched random control datasets (MRC).
LEDGF/p75 depletion increased the percentage safe sites to 14.7%
(p-value b 0.005, Pearson's Chi-square compared to the DMSO control
condition), a phenotype that is reverted upon LEDGF/p75 back comple-
mentation (data not shown). The shift in integration site distribution
under LEDGIN treatment (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 3a–c), coincides
with a dose-dependent increase in percentage of safe integrations
(16.51% at 50 μM, p-value b 0.005, Pearson's Chi-square compared to
the DMSO control condition), consistent with the data obtained under
LEDGF/p75 depletion.
3.8. LEDGIN Treatment Inhibits Integration, Relatively Increases the Quies-
cent Viral Reservoir and Reduces Reactivation in Primary CD4+ T Cells
Since recent studies reported the existence of a latently infected cell
population after infection of activated primary CD4+ T cells (Calvanese
et al., 2013; Chavez et al., 2015; Dahabieh et al., 2013), we tried to cor-
roborate the effect of LEDGIN treatment on proviral latency in this
model. Human PBMCs were purified, selectively enriched for CD4+ T
cells using Bi-specific MAb CD3.8 and infected with the OGH reporter
virus, in the presence or absence of LEDGINs (Fig. 7a,b). Similar to the
results observed in SupT1 cells, LEDGIN (CX014442) treatment induced
a dose-dependent decrease in the % infected cells (decrease in %
eGFP+/mKO2+ cells or overall % mKO2+ cells, Fig. 7a) and an
increase in the fraction quiescent cells (% eGFP−, mKO2+ cells) /
(% mKO2+ cells) ∗ 100 (Fig. 7b) reaching 46.3% quiescence at a
CX014442 concentration of 25 μM (representative data from one
donor are shown for 2 different donors tested). Next we evaluated
the multimodal effect of LEDGIN treatment on integration, assem-
bly and reactivation in a multiple round reactivation model using
WT HIV in resting CD4 + T-cells in order to model the in vivo situa-
tion. PHA/IL-2 activated primary (resting) CD4 + T cells were in-
fected with NL4.3 virus in the presence of submicromolar
concentrations of LEDGINs. At day four post infection (p.i.)
LEDGINs were removed and cells were reseeded in the presence
of PMA and PHA. Virus production upon reactivation was measured
at day 7 p.i. by p24 ELISA. LEDGIN treatment reduced the number of
proviral DNA copies in CD4 + T-cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 7c). These residual integrants were less susceptible to reacti-
vation as displayed by the reduced p24 production (Fig. 7d, data
show the average for two different donors tested). Apart from re-
ducing overall integration, these data suggested that LEDGIN treat-
ment during HIV infection leads to quiescence of the residual
integrants both in SupT1 and primary CD4 + T-cells. This quiescent
reservoir appears less susceptible to reactivation.
4. Discussion
The moral duty to respond to the call for an HIV cure calls for ex-
ploration of experimental and innovative HIV cure strategies. As a
complement to current purge-and-kill approaches aimed at forcing
HIV out of its hiding places to obtain a sterilizing cure, we here pro-
vide experimental evidence for a strategy to push the virus towards
transcriptional quiescence by interference with LEDGF/p75, the
main determinant of integration site selection. General belief states
that latency is an accident rather than a default pathway of an
actively replicating cytopathic virus. The fact that LEDGF/p75, the
tethering determinant of HIV integration, directs integration prefer-
entially towards actively transcribed regions, ensuring productive
infection, is consistent with this notion. Recently, it was proposed
that HIV latency is a hardwired, evolutionarily conserved switch in-
creasing the likelihood of successful mucosal transmission during
primary infection (Razooky et al., 2015; Rouzine et al., 2015).
Whereas HIV Tat is known to be the main viral determinant in con-
trolling the HIV transcriptional state, the contribution of other viral
and host determinants to the transcriptional state of the HIV provi-
rus awaits further clarification. Here we investigated the role of
LEDGF/p75 in the establishment of HIV latency. We demonstrate
that LEDGF/p75 depletion, known to result in retargeting of integra-
tion away from the body of actively transcribed genes (Fadel et al.,
2014; Schrijvers et al., 2012a; Shun et al., 2007), increases the frac-
tion of quiescently infected cells and simultaneously decreases the
reactivation potential of the proviruses. In light of the recently pro-
posed role of LEDGF/p75 (and the Iws1/Spt6 complex) in post-inte-
gration HIV transcriptional repression (Gérard et al., 2015), this
observed decrease may even be an underestimation of the contribu-
tion of the integration environment to the latent phenotype. Taken
together, these observations suggest that disruption of the LEDGF/
p75–IN interaction not only inhibits integration but could as well af-
fect the establishment of the latent pool and the reactivation from
latency.
Recently developed LEDGINs, small molecule inhibitors of LEDGF/
p75–IN interaction, allowed us to test this hypothesis. Indeed here we
demonstrate: (i) a LEDGIN-mediated shift in lentiviral integration site
distribution resembling LEDGF/p75 depletion (out of the body of active-
ly transcribed genes, with increased integration in the vicinity of CpG
islands) ii) strongly reduced but authentic residual integration, (iii) a
LEDGIN-mediated shift in 3D nuclear location of HIV provirus away
from the nuclear rim; (iv) a relative increase in the fraction of quiescent
proviruses and (v) a dose-dependent block in HIV reactivation from
latency both in cell lines and primary CD4+ T-cells. It was recently pro-
posed that pushing enough proviruses into quiescence could drive the
basic reproduction number of HIV below 1, resulting in unsustainable
infection (Rouzine et al., 2015). LEDGIN treatment apparently succeeds
in rendering (almost) 100% of the virus into a quiescent state refractory
to reactivation (Figs. 5c & f and 6). Although final proof will only be
obtained in clinical trials, our cell culture data in relevant cell lines and
primary cells provide evidence for the feasibility of this strategy. The
importance of the site of integration in the human genome for basal
transcriptional activity of HIV was evidenced more than a decade ago
(Jordan et al., 2001). Now it is known that genomic target site selection
during lentiviral integration is a multi-step process where biases are in-
troduced at different levels, which each in part affect the stochastic pro-
viral gene expression levels. At least three levels can be recognized. First,
nuclear topology and proximity to the nucleopore affect integration site
selection (Di Primio et al., 2013; Marini et al., 2015). Next, chromatin
readers such as LEDGF/p75 or HRP-2 that recognize epigenetic marks
associated with transcriptional activity tether the preintegration com-
plex to active gene regions. No data exist suggesting a protein gradient.
Therefore, as proposed by Marini et al. (2015), preferential lentiviral in-
tegration within the proximity of the nuclear periphery probably re-
flects the encounter by the HIV PIC of the first LEDGF/p75 bound

 chromatin close to nucleopores. Finally, bias for target DNA base recog-
nition by integrases also influences local and global integration patterns
(Demeulemeester et al., 2014b, 2015; Serrao et al., 2015). In theory, in-
terference with any of those mechanisms could shift the resulting pro-
viral reservoir from transcriptionally active to quiescent. Both LEDGF/
p75 depletion and LEDGIN treatment affect integration, integration
site selection (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 3a–c) and nuclear location
(Fig. 4). Probably the reduced reactivation due to altered chromatin
context is not entirely reflected by the features measured in the integra-
tion site analysis. As shown, aberrant integrations or LTR deletions are
most likely not contributing, or only to a minor extent (Supplementary
Fig. 5 and Table 2). In the absence of LEDGF/p75, HRP2 determines HIV
integration site selection. The fact that LEDGINs also inhibit the interac-
tion between HRP-2 and HIV-1 IN (Schrijvers et al., 2012a), can explain
the more pronounced effect of LEDGINs on reactivation from quiescence
compared to LEDGF/p75-depletion. Identification of the exact nature of
the altered chromatin context responsible for the observed phenotype
awaits further experimentation. HIV latency is of multifactorial nature
and the transcriptional state of integrated provirus is not only influ-
enced by molecular determinants but also depends on the infected
host cell and its activation state (Dahabieh et al., 2015). Therefore the
respective quiescent fraction and responsiveness to different LRAs
might alter depending on the cell model used since promoter activity
may differ between cell types. In order to study the effect of integration
site distribution on HIV latency we used NL4.3-based (HIV-tCD34) and
LAI-based (OGH) single round reporter viruses in a concise reactivation
setup in T-cell lines and activated CD4+ T-cells. LEDGINs block HIV rep-
lication during integration (referred to as ‘the early effect’) as well as
during assembly (i.e. ‘the late effect’), with inhibition during the late
step having a 10- to 100 fold higher potency than the early step
(Debyser et al., 2015). In the experiments with single round virus, we
used micromolar concentrations of LEDGIN, required to inhibit the
Fig. 7. LEDGIN treatment inhibits integration, induces quiescence of the residual viral reservoir and reduces reactivation in primary CD4+ T cells. (a) Activated CD4+ T-cells were infected
with single round double reporter virus (OGH) and the % eGFP and % mKO2 positive cells were monitored. Dose–response curve shows a decrease both in the % eGFP+, mKO2+ cells and
overall % mKO2+ cells with increasing LEDGIN (CX014442) concentration. (b) The fraction of silently infected cell population (% eGFP−, mKO2+ cells) / (% mKO2+ cells) ∗ 100 increases
upon addition of LEDGINs. Data are representative for two different donors. All vectors are VSV-G pseudotyped. eGFP, Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein; mKO2, Mutant Kusubira

 early step. Interestingly, recent experimental results suggest that addi-
tion of submicromolar concentrations of LEDGINs during virus produc-
tion results in viruses that after integration are again refractory to
LTR-driven gene expression (Supplementary Fig. 7), suggesting that
during multiple round replication also low concentrations of LEDGINs
induce quiescent proviral pools. Our data were corroborated with wt
NL4.3 virus in IL-2/PHA activated primary CD4+ T-cells (Fig. 7). These
multiple round experiments allowed the use of submicromolar LEDGIN
(CX014442) concentrations. It will be of interest to extend these obser-
vations in the future to other latency models. Preliminary data in a more
sophisticated model for HIV latency based on infection of CCL19-activat-
ed resting CD4+ cells (Spina et al., 2013) corroborates a LEDGIN-medi-
ated shift of the HIV reservoir into a quiescent state refractory to
reactivation (unpublished data). Evidence is growing that initiation of
cART early after infection is effective in reducing the size of the viral res-
ervoir (Ananworanich et al., 2012, 2015; Hocqueloux et al., 2013; Hoen
et al., 2007; Malatinkova et al., 2015). Early treatment initiation with
ART will likely become standard clinical practice in HIV care. This is sup-
ported by the outcome of the first large-scale international “Strategic
Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment” (START) study, showing a consid-
erably lower risk of developing AIDS and other serious conditions
when compared to later treatment initiation (INSIGHT START Study
Group, 2015).
We here propose that LEDGINs, currently in (pre-)clinical develop-
ment as antivirals, could eventually and in synergy with existing
antiretrovirals contribute to an HIV remission by acting as potent antivi-
rals with the additional capacity to affect the transcriptional state of the
residual HIV reservoir. In an ideal format LEDGINs should be evaluated
in combination with cART regimens initiated during acute infection be-
fore reservoirs are established. In light of recent findings on ongoing HIV
replication, penetration of drugs in lymph nodes will be required. For
HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) LEDGINs have the added benefit
that any residual provirus may turn out to be refractory to reactivation.
It is clear that this final outcome utterly depends on well-designed clin-
ical trials and surpasses any claims made in this work. Still, we provide
initial evidence in cell culture and primary cells for an important role of
LEDGF/p75 in the establishment of the replicating reservoir. LEDGINs
will allow us to investigate in clinical trials a novel strategy based on a
retargeted, more quiescent proviral reservoir. LEDGIN treatment during
acute HIV infection may result in proviruses that are refractory to reac-
tivation after treatment interruption leading to an HIV remission.
