Prevalence of Disabilities and Health Care Access by Disability Status and Type 
Among Adults — United States, 2016
Catherine A. Okoro, PhD1; NaTasha D. Hollis, PhD1; Alissa C. Cyrus, MPH1; Shannon Griffin-Blake, PhD1
Persons with disabilities face greater barriers to health care 
than do those without disabilities (1). To identify characteristics 
of noninstitutionalized adults with six specific disability types 
(hearing, vision, cognition, mobility, self-care, and independent 
living),* and to assess disability-specific disparities in health care 
access, CDC analyzed 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
System (BRFSS) data. The prevalences of disability overall and 
by disability type, and access to health care by disability type, 
were estimated. Analyses were stratified by three age groups: 
18–44 years (young adults), 45–64 years (middle-aged adults), 
and ≥65 years (older adults). Among young adults, cognitive dis-
ability (10.6%) was the most prevalent type. Mobility disability 
was most prevalent among middle-aged (18.1%) and older adults 
(26.9%). Generally, disability prevalences were higher among 
women, American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN), adults with 
income below the federal poverty level (FPL), and persons in the 
South U.S. Census region. Disability-specific disparities in health 
care access were prevalent, particularly among young and middle-
aged adults. These data might inform public health programs of 
the sociodemographic characteristics and disparities in health care 
access associated with age and specific disability types and guide 
efforts to improve access to care for persons with disabilities.
BRFSS is an ongoing state-based, random-digit–dialed 
telephone survey of noninstitutionalized U.S. adults aged 
≥18 years.† The median survey response rate among the 
50 states and the District of Columbia in 2016 was 47.0%.§ 
The 2016 BRFSS survey included questions about six dis-
ability types (hearing, vision, cognition, mobility, self-care, 
and independent living).¶ Respondents were identified as 
* Based on Section 4302 of the Affordable Care Act, the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services issued data collection standard guidance to include 
a standard set of disability identifiers in all national population health surveys.

§ Response rates for BRFSS are calculated using the standard set by the American 
Association for Public Opinion Research response rate formula 4 (http://www.aapor.
org/AAPOR_Main/media/publications/Standard-Definitions20169theditionfinal.

a proportion of all eligible and likely eligible persons. https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/

¶ The interviewer first reads a preamble to the telephone survey respondent (“The following 
questions are about health problems or impairments you may have. Some people who 
are deaf or have serious difficulty hearing may or may not use equipment to communicate 
by phone.”), followed by the six specific disability type questions. The questions are “Are 
you deaf or do you have serious difficulty hearing?” (hearing); “Are you blind or do you 
have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?” (vision); “Because of a physical, 
mental, or emotional condition, do you have serious difficulty concentrating, 
remembering, or making decisions?” (cognition); “Do you have serious difficulty walking 
or climbing stairs?” (mobility); “Do you have difficulty dressing or bathing?” (self-care); 
and “Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have difficulty doing 
errands alone such as visiting a doctor’s office or shopping?” (independent living).
having one of the disability types if they answered “yes” to 
the relevant question. Persons who responded “yes” to at 
least one disability question were identified as having any 
disability. Persons who responded “no” to all six questions 
were identified as having no disability. Missing responses and 
respondents who answered “don’t know” or who declined to 
answer were excluded. Four health care access measures (i.e., 
health insurance coverage, having a usual health care provider, 
receipt of a routine check-up within the past year, and having 
an unmet health care need because of cost) were included.** 
Prevalences (with 95% confidence intervals) were calculated 
for any disability and disability type by sex, race/ethnicity,†† 
FPL,§§ and U.S. Census region, and for health care access 
measures, by disability status and types. All analyses were strati-
fied by age group (18–44, 45–64, and ≥65 years). Analyses 
accounted for the complex sampling design.
One in four noninstitutionalized U.S. adults (25.7%, rep-
resenting an estimated 61.4 million persons) reported any 
disability (Table 1) (Figure). Mobility was the most prevalent 
disability type (13.7%), followed by cognition (10.8%), inde-
pendent living (6.8%), hearing (5.9%), vision (4.6%), and self-
care (3.7%). Prevalences of any disability, hearing, mobility, 
and independent living disabilities were higher among older 
adults, whereas prevalence of cognitive disability was highest 
 
** Health insurance coverage was ascertained by a “yes” response to the question 
“Do you have any kind of health care coverage, including health insurance, 
prepaid plans such as health maintenance organizations, government plans such 
as Medicare, or Indian Health Service?” Having a usual health care provider was 
assessed first with the question “Do you have one person you think of as your 
personal doctor or health care provider?” Persons who responded “no” were 
asked the question “Is there more than one, or is there no person who you think 
of as your personal doctor or health care provider?” Responses for having a usual 
health care provider were dichotomized into one or more and none. Receipt of 
a routine check-up was assessed with the question “About how long has it been 
since you last visited a doctor for a routine checkup? A routine checkup is a 
general physical exam, not an exam for a specific injury, illness, or condition.” 
Responses for having had a routine check-up within the preceding 12 months 
were dichotomized into within the past year or not within the past year. Unmet 
health care need because of cost was ascertained by a “yes” response to the 
question “Was there a time in the past 12 months when you needed to see a 
doctor but could not because of cost?”
 
†† Persons in all racial groups were non-Hispanic. Persons who self-identified as 
Hispanic might have been of any race.
 
§§ Poverty categories are based on the ratio of the respondent’s annual household 
income to the appropriate simplified 2015 federal poverty threshold (given 
family size: number of adults (1–14) in the household and number of children 
(≥0) in the household) defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. This ratio is 
multiplied by 100 to be expressed as a percentage, and federal poverty 
thresholds were then used to categorize respondents into four FPL categories: 
1) <100% of FPL (poor), 2) ≥100%–<200% of FPL (near poor), 3) ≥200% 
of FPL (not poor), and 4) unknown.

among middle-aged (11.9%) and young adults (10.6%), and 
lowest among older adults (9.5%). Among middle-aged and 
older adults, the prevalences of vision disability (6.1% and 
6.6%, respectively) and self-care disability (5.5% in both) 
were similar. Among all age groups, the prevalences of any 
disability and of each type were higher among women than 
among men, with the exceptions of hearing and self-care. The 
reported prevalence of hearing disability was higher among 
men than among women for all age groups (young adults: 
men = 2.4% versus women = 1.6%; middle-aged adults: 7.6% 
versus 4.2%; and older adults: 19.4% versus 11.3%), and 
the reported prevalences of self-care disability were approxi-
mately the same. Generally, among young and middle-aged 
adults, the highest prevalences of any disability and of each 
type were reported among AI/AN and persons in the “other 
race/multiracial” group, whereas the lowest prevalences were 
reported among Asians. Among older adults, approximately 
half of AI/AN (54.9%), Hispanics (50.5%), and persons in 
the “other race/multiracial” group (49.9%) reported any dis-
ability. Within each age group, the prevalences of any and each

disability type declined with decreasing poverty. Across all age 
groups, higher prevalences of any disability and of each type 
were generally reported in the South compared with other 
U.S. Census regions.
In 2016, for each disability type, prevalences of health insur-
ance coverage, having a usual health care provider, and receiving 
a check-up during the preceding 12 months increased with 
increasing age group, whereas, with the exception of persons 
with a vision disability, the prevalence of having an unmet 
health care need because of cost decreased (Table 2). Young 
and middle-aged adults with a vision disability had the lowest 
prevalences of having health insurance coverage (74.9% and 
81.3%, respectively), a usual health care provider (64.0% and 
82.3%, respectively), and, among younger adults, of having 
received a check-up during the preceding 12 months (58.0%). 
Within these age groups, adults with a self-care disability had the 
highest prevalences of having health insurance coverage (83.1% 
and 88.8%, respectively) and a usual health care provider (76.3% 
and 89.0%, respectively), similar to middle-aged adults with an 
independent living disability (89.0%). The prevalences of hav-
ing received a routine check-up during the past 12 months were 
higher among young adults with a mobility disability (69.1%) 
and middle-aged adults with a self-care disability (81.6%). 
Having a health care need that was unmet because of cost con-
siderations was most prevalent among younger adults with an 
independent living disability (36.7%) and middle-aged adults 
with a vision disability (35.5%), and was least prevalent among 
younger and middle-aged adults with a hearing disability (31.2% 
and 24.1%, respectively). Most health care access measures were 
similar by disability type among older adults, with the exception 
of having an unmet health care need because of cost, which 
ranged from 7.3% (hearing) to 14.0% (self-care).

Discussion
This is the first report of disability prevalence measured using 
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services six-ques-
tion set through BRFSS and that examines sociodemographic 
characteristics and disparities in health care access by age group 
and disability type. In 2016, one in four noninstitutionalized 
U.S. adults reported any disability; a previous CDC report found 
a disability in one in five U.S. adults (2). The higher disability 
prevalence reported here likely resulted from the addition of the 
hearing disability question in 2016. The reported prevalence of 
hearing disability (5.9%) is consistent with other reports (3–5), 
and there were negligible (i.e., <1%) increases in prevalences of 
the other five disability types from 2013 to 2016.
Social determinants of health, such as sex, race/ethnicity, 
socioeconomic status, geographic location, and access to and 
use of quality health services influence the health and well-
being of populations (6). Consistent with previous research 
(2), this analysis identified disparities in prevalences of any 
disability and disability type by sex, race/ethnicity, socioeco-
nomic status, and geographic region. Women reported higher 
prevalences of any disability and of each disability type (except 
hearing and self-care) than did men. Higher prevalences of 
disability were reported by persons living in poverty; middle-
aged adults living in poverty reported nearly five times the 
prevalence of mobility disability as did those who reported 
household income ≥200% of FPL. In this study, persons resid-
ing in the South U.S. Census region generally reported higher

prevalences of disability. Chronic conditions associated with 
leading causes of disability (i.e., arthritis and heart trouble) (7) 
and associated lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, overweight and 
obesity, and hypertension), are more prevalent in the South 
than in other U.S. Census regions.¶¶ The multiple determi-
nants of health underscore the need for cross-sector approaches 
to effectively mitigate health inequities experienced by persons 
with disabilities.
Similar to previous research (8,9), this analysis identified 
disability-specific disparities in health care access, particularly 
among young and middle-aged adults. Disability-specific fac-
tors, such as severity of disability, age at disability onset, or hav-
ing multiple disability types or comorbidities might partially 
explain why persons in these age groups, and those reporting 
self-care and mobility disabilities, had higher prevalences of 
access to care than did those reporting vision and hearing 
disabilities (5,9). Among persons aged ≥65 years, the primary 
disparity was in unmet health care need because of cost; adults 
reporting self-care disability had nearly twice the prevalence 
of cost-related unmet health care need than did those report-
ing hearing disability. By age 65 years, approximately 98% of 
Americans have access to Medicare coverage (10) and might 
have increased access to health care services. Nonetheless, older 
adults reporting self-care disability might face more financial 
strain because of a higher level of medical need compared with 
persons without such disability (1).

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, BRFSS data are cross-sectional, and causality among 
sociodemographic characteristics, health care access, and dis-
ability cannot be inferred. Second, disability estimates are likely 
underestimates because BRFSS is only administered to noninsti-
tutionalized adults and excludes persons living in long-term care 
facilities, such as older adults who might have higher disability 
prevalences. This could, in part, explain the higher prevalence 
estimates of cognitive disability among middle-aged and young 
adults compared with older adults, and the similar estimates of 
vision disability and self-care disability among middle-aged and 
older adults. In addition, questions used to assess hearing, vision, 
cognition, and mobility disabilities were designed to capture 
serious difficulty in these basic actions; thus, adults with milder 
difficulties might not be identified. Third, BRFSS data were 
self-reported and might be subject to self-report biases. Finally, 
nonresponse bias remains a possibility, although the weighting 
methodology used by BRFSS adjusts for nonresponse bias.
Prevalence of disability varied by age group and sociodemo-
graphic characteristics. Health care access varied by age group 
and disability type. Identifying disparities in access to health care 
highlights disability types and selected demographic groups*** 
 *** Disability and Health Data System (https://dhds.cdc.gov/), an online, 
interactive data tool developed and maintained by CDC, presents yearly 
state-level data on prevalence of disability as well as approximately 30 
demographic and health indicators, including health care access, for adults 
with disabilities overall and by type.

that might benefit most from interventions that improve health 
care access, receipt of needed health services, and coordinated 
care. These have the potential to improve health behaviors, 
prevent secondary conditions, delay the progression of disability, 
or, through early detection of disease, permit early intervention 
that might improve health outcomes. Improved understanding 
of disability-specific differences in health care access and the 
provision of medical care might improve the specificity and 
effectiveness of interventions, accessibility, and outreach to 
reduce disability-specific disparities in health care access.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
In 2013, based on questions to assess five disability types (i.e., 
vision, cognition, mobility, self-care, and independent living), 
one in five U.S. adults reported a disability.
What is added by this report?
In 2016, using the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services six-question set, one in four (61 million) U.S. adults 
reported any disability; nearly 6% reported hearing disability. 
Adults with disabilities, particularly those aged 18–44 and 
45–64 years, experienced disparities in health care access by 
disability type.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Public health programs might benefit from the information 
provided in this report to develop and improve interven-
tions, accessibility, and outreach to reduce disparities in 
health care access.
