Abstract
Nanoscale drug delivery vehicles can facilitate multimodal therapies of cancer by promoting 
tumour-selective drug release. However, few are effective because cancer cells develop ways to 
resist and evade treatment. Here, we introduce a photoactivatable multi-inhibitor nanoliposome 
(PMIL) that imparts light-induced cytotoxicity in synchrony with photo-initiated and sustained 
release of inhibitors that suppress tumour regrowth and treatment escape signalling pathways. The

 PMIL consists of a nanoliposome doped with a photoactivatable chromophore (benzoporphyrin 
derivative, BPD) in the lipid bilayer, and a nanoparticle containing cabozantinib (XL184)—a 
multikinase inhibitor—encapsulated inside. Near infrared tumour irradiation, following 
intravenous PMIL administration, triggers photodynamic damage of tumour cells and 
microvessels, and simultaneously initiates release of XL184 inside the tumour. A single PMIL 
treatment achieves prolonged tumour reduction in two mouse models and suppresses metastatic 
escape in an orthotopic pancreatic tumour model. The PMIL offers new prospects for cancer 
therapy by enabling spatiotemporal control of drug release whilst reducing systemic drug exposure 
and associated toxicities.
Nanoscale drug delivery systems enable controlled drug release with increased tumour 
selectivity and reduced toxicity1. Recently, multifunctional nanoparticles activated by 
external stimuli have emerged to enhance tumour-selective drug release1. These activatable 
delivery vehicles include optically responsive nanomaterials that support a broad range of 
biophotonic therapy and imaging applications2–4, offering great promise for facilitating 
multimodal therapies of cancer. However, a fundamental challenge in oncology is that a 
number of resistance mechanisms and escape pathways ultimately limit treatment 
efficacy5,6.
Here, we report near infrared (NIR) light-activated PMILs that impart photocytotoxicity to 
multiple tumour compartments and enable photo-initiated, sustained release of a 
multimolecular inhibitor with potent antiangiogenic activity and suppression of prominent 
treatment escape pathways (Fig. 1a). This unique approach impairs multiple, distinct 
molecular targets and is motivated by a three-way mechanistic interaction to combine: (i) 
photodynamic therapy (PDT)-induced tumour cell apoptotic signalling with XL184 
inhibition of anti-apoptotic signalling pathways that promote cell survival; (ii) PDT-induced 
microvessel damage with sustained XL184 inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) signalling to suppress tumour angiogenesis and vascular regrowth; and, (iii) 
exploiting a second molecular target of XL184, sustained inhibition of MET—the receptor 
tyrosine kinase for hepatocyte growth factor—signalling to suppress cancer cell motility, 
invasion and metastatic escape in response to tumour hypoxia induced by vascular damage 
and antiangiogenic therapy7,8. We show that BPD–XL184 PMILs realize these 
complementary interactions, resulting in enhanced tumour reduction in vivo in two mouse 
models of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In contrast to the 
corresponding monotherapies and combination therapy using conventional drug 
formulations, a single treatment cycle using PMILs results in prolonged local tumour control 
in a subcutaneous and in an orthotopic PDAC mouse model.
VEGF and MET are prime examples of tumour signalling pathways that promote treatment 
escape. VEGF and its receptors (e.g., VEGFR2) represent key targets for antiangiogenic 
therapy, and up-regulation of VEGF signalling has been observed in response to 
radiotherapy9, chemotherapy10, cytoreductive surgery11, and PDT12,13. MET is frequently 
expressed by cancer stem-like cells thought to drive tumour recurrence14, and abnormal 
MET signalling has been shown to promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition15, cancer 
cell stemness15 as well as tumour growth, invasion and metastasis5,15. Moreover, MET

 signalling is also observed in response to anti-VEGF therapy and comprises a prominent 
escape mechanism from antiangiogenic treatments5. When the tumour vasculature is pruned 
by anti-VEGF therapy, the hypoxic tumour microenvironment stimulates MET 
expression7,8,16. McDonald and colleagues elegantly demonstrated that concurrent inhibition 
of the VEGF and MET signalling pathways results in the favourable benefits of 
antiangiogenic therapy in slowing tumour growth while mitigating the unwanted 
consequences of increased intratumoural hypoxia—cancer cell migration and tumour growth 
along remaining, functional vessels as well as via lymphatic routes16,17. Here, we 
demonstrate that PDAC tumours transiently up-regulate MET signalling in response to PDT 
in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 1), which closes the triangle to motivate a three-way interactive 
therapy (Fig. 1b)—suggesting a compelling rationale to combine concurrent anti-VEGF and 
-MET therapy with PDT—and motivated development of the PMIL.
This approach—utilizing liposomes loaded with a lipophilic therapeutic agent and 
encapsulating a PLGA nanoparticle that releases a second, complementary agent—is 
supported by the reported successes of nanoliposome-based delivery of 
chemotherapeutics18,19 (Supplementary Note 1). An advantage of this hybrid drug delivery 
vehicle is that its lipid18 and polymer components20,21 are all in clinical use and are 
biodegradable, nontoxic chemicals that can be metabolized by the body. PMILs build on 
these advances by utilizing light activation not only for photodynamic action but also as a 
drug release mechanism to enable tumour-focused, spatiotemporally synchronized 
combination therapies. This opens the door to a number of combination therapies for which 
capturing and suppressing bursts in molecular signalling dynamics is key.
PMIL design, synthesis and characterization
PMILs were synthesized with the lipophilic photosensitizer BPD formulated within the lipid 
bilayer of a liposome encapsulating PLGA nanoparticles20,21 loaded with the hydrophobic 
multikinase inhibitor XL184 (Figs. 2a–c). The NP[XL184] was engineered to optimize the 
XL184 loading efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 2) and to be smaller in diameter than the 
liposomes (Figs. 2d,e) in order to facilitate its encapsulation within the liposome. In this 
design, the lipid bilayer acts to protect NP[XL184] from solvent exposure, limiting 
hydrolysis and systemic XL184 release prior to photo-induced drug release (Figs. 2f,g and 
Supplementary Fig. 3). We reasoned that NIR irradiation (using a 690 nm laser matched to 
BPD absorption) could deposit enough photonic energy to promote BPD-mediated 
photochemistry at the lipid bilayer and disrupt the integrity of the liposome4,22 
(Supplementary Note 2), thereby exposing the NP[XL184] to solvent and accelerating the 
liberation of the payload in the target lesion (Fig. 2f). Reactive oxygen species scavengers 
significantly suppressed photo-induced XL184 release indicating the involvement of 
photochemical drug release (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 4). The 50:50 PLGA ratio used 
to synthesize the NP[XL184] is designed for sustained XL184 delivery over a period of 
several days, with an initial burst release upon liposome disruption and water contact that is 
followed by a slower, sustained release phase due to nanoparticle erosion and XL184 
diffusion (Fig. 2f)20. In contrast, XL184 is released from the PMIL over a period of several 
weeks in the absence of photo-induced release (Fig. 2f). Electron microscopy indicates a 
NP[XL184] encapsulation efficiency of ~20% within liposomes (Figs. 3a–c and 
Spring et al.

 Supplementary Fig. 5) and disruption of the bilayer following laser irradiation (Figs. 3d,e 
and Supplementary Fig. 5). Surprisingly, although the majority of NP[XL184] is 
unencapsulated by a lipid bilayer, light activated drug release is prominent and might be 
explained by self-assembly of lipid monolayers onto PLGA nanoparticles (Supplementary 
Note 3).
Upon photo-release, XL184 is liberated to initiate inhibition of multiple kinases 
(Supplementary Note 4). XL184 is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for 
treatment of patients with medullary thyroid cancer, based on a promising phase III trial23, 
and is currently in clinical trials for PDAC (NCT01663272) as well as for a number of other 
malignancies. Because XL184 inhibits escape of anti-VEGF therapy via MET signalling16 
and inhibits pancreatic cancer stem-like cells14,24, XL184 offers promise for treatment of 
PDAC in comparison to the poor phase III results for using anti-VEGF therapy alone in 
combination with gemcitabine25.
In addition to photo-release of NP[XL184], NIR irradiation also triggers BPD-PDT to 
directly damage microvasculature, cancer cells or both, depending on the time of 
illumination following BPD administration26–28. As an example, BPD-PDT is used routinely 
in the clinic for selective closure of choroidal neovasculature associated with age-related 
macular degeneration while sparing the overlying neurosensory retina to preserve visual 
acuity29. For oncological applications, BPD-PDT is often most effective at time points that 
balance BPD localization in neovasculature with extravasation into the tumour parenchyma 
(60–90 minutes post-injection), which induces both microvasculature and cancer cell 
destruction26. In a promising phase I/II clinical trial (VERTPAC), such a BPD-PDT regimen 
produced a 1–4 cm zone of tumour necrosis with a 100% patient response rate for light 
delivered via optical fibers positioned percutaneously within locally advanced PDAC 
tumours under computed tomography guidance30. Moreover, the unique mechanisms of cell 
death induced by PDT31,32—including direct damage to Bcl-2 protein (a major anti-
apoptotic factor and mediator of drug-resistance) and mitochondrial cytochrome c release (a 
potent pro-apoptotic signal)—are effective against chemo- and radioresistant cells33–35 and 
sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutics33,34 as well as to molecular inhibitors12,36.
BPD is nontoxic (Supplementary Note 5), however, XL184 possesses significant toxicities 
that can require concomitant medications, dose interruption or dose reduction23. To limit the 
need for chronic XL184 administration and its systemic exposure to the body, the PMIL was 
designed to realize tumour-focused release of XL184.
Cellular PMIL internalization and in vitro efficacy
Cellular uptake of PMILs and of liposomes loaded with BPD in the bilayer but lacking 
XL184, L[BPD], was determined by BPD fluorescence confocal microscopy in monolayer 
cultures of AsPC1 cells derived from metastatic human PDAC ascites (VEGR1+ and MET+ 
with multiple oncogenic mutations; Supplementary Note 6). Both the PMIL and the L[BPD] 
underwent cellular internalization (Fig. 4a), with similarity to the pharmaceutical 
formulation of BPD35. BPD-PDT of AsPC1 cells using either L[BPD] or PMILs results in 
increased MET activation (Figs. 4b,c and Supplementary Fig. 6). PDT-induced MET

 activation is down regulated using scavengers of reactive oxygen species produced by PDT 
photochemistry or by inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated 
transactivation of MET (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Note 7). To investigate MET inhibition 
upon PMIL uptake into cancer cells, and photo-induced release of XL184, western blotting 
was used to measure phosphorylated MET (pMET; activated MET) as well as total MET 
expression for untreated AsPC1 cells versus cells treated with L[BPD] or PMILs that 
received a sub-lethal dose of NIR light (1 J·cm −2) after a 1 h incubation period (Fig. 4c). 
BPD-PDT using L[BPD] results in enhanced MET phosphorylation while PMILs suppress 
MET activation (Fig. 4c). In the absence of photo-induced XL184 release, the PMILs have 
no effect on the basal pMET level (Fig. 4c). These results indicate that NIR irradiation 
triggers XL184 release from the PMIL such that the initiation of MET inhibition coincides 
with photodynamic cytotoxicity. Note that in contrast to photoinduced suppression of MET 
activation, none of the treatment arms had a significant impact on the total MET level.
Harnessing this photo-induced release of XL184 from PMILs, we hypothesized that 
simultaneous photocytotoxicity and inhibition of MET activation—and, thereby, suppression 
of downstream anti-apoptotic survival pathways14—could enhance cancer cell death. Note 
that XL184 also inhibits other receptor tyrosine kinases involved in intra- and autocrine 
cancer cell signalling, such as VEGFR1 (Supplementary Note 4). Cancer cell death was 
probed for the following treatments (250 nM BPD and/or 100–125 nM XL184) administered 
to AsPC1 cells: XL184; NP[XL184]; L[BPD]; co-administration of L[BPD] and 
NP[XL184] as separate agents; and, PMIL. The submicromolar doses of XL184 used here 
do not induce cancer cell death as a single agent (Fig. 4d; Supplementary Note 8). NIR 
photoirradiation (690 nm) was performed for a range of light doses (0–10 J·cm−2) 1 h post 
drug administration. L[BPD]- and PMIL-PDT showed a characteristic increase in cell killing 
with increasing light dose with no dark toxicity. Furthermore, MET inhibition using PMILs 
induces an enhanced level of cancer cell death in comparison to L[BPD]-PDT as well as in 
comparison to co-administration of L[BPD] and NP[XL184] as separate agents (Fig. 4d). 
Collectively, these in vitro cancer cell culture studies indicate that inhibition of kinase 
activation simultaneous with photocytotoxicity can enhance cancer cell death.
PMIL efficacy in two mouse models of pancreatic cancer
The suppression of MET activation and modest enhancement of cancer cell cytotoxicity 
using the PMIL in vitro is promising for in vivo application. In vivo, the PMIL acts not only 
on cancer cells but also on paracrine receptor tyrosine kinase signalling, the tumour 
vasculature, tumour cell motility and metastatic escape, with potential to provide further 
gains in efficacy compared to conventional drug formulations. For instance, XL184 acts on 
endothelial cells lining tumour blood16 and lymphatic17 vessels (e.g., via VEGFR 
inhibition). To assess the efficacy of PMILs in controlling localized tumours in vivo, we 
performed a single treatment cycle in established xenograft tumours (~50 mm3 in size) 18 d 
following subcutaneous implantation of AsPC1 cells in mice. A single intravenous 
administration of the following treatments was given to the randomized mice: no-treatment 
control; XL184; NP[XL184]; L[BPD]; co-administration of L[BPD] and NP[XL184] as 
separate agents; and, PMIL. Each formulation contained 0.25 mg·kg−1 of BPD and/or 0.1–
0.125 mg·kg−1 XL184. Here, NIR irradiation was performed 1 h following injection—via

 transcutaneous illumination of the tumour—to induce both vascular and cancer cell 
destruction. In contrast to continued tumour growth observed for XL184 and BPD-PDT 
monotherapy, PMIL-mediated combination therapy exhibited a pronged reduction in tumour 
volume over 10 d following a single treatment (Fig. 5a). Compared to the no-treatment 
control group, the mean tumour reduction following PMIL treatment was 92% (day 37; Fig. 
5b). This result contrasts with the monotherapy controls and the combination therapy by 
conventional co-administration of L[BPD] and NP[XL184] as separate agents—all of which 
showed marginal anti-tumour effects as a trend in slowing tumour growth but did not 
achieve a significant reduction in tumour volume (Fig. 5a,b).
To investigate toxicity, metastasis and microvascular effects, and to further probe local 
tumour control in an additional tumour model using PMILs, we next investigated the same 
treatment arms in a metastatic mouse model by implanting PDAC cells into the pancreas. 
Mouse weight was monitored before (day 10 post-tumour inoculation) and after (day 24) 
treatment as a metric of toxicity (Fig. 5c). The gain in mouse weight and 100% survival of 
the mice through the treatment endpoint (day 24) indicate that PDT combined with low dose 
XL184 treatment has low toxicity (Fig. 5c). Furthermore, pancreatic tumour volumes and 
histopathology (Supplementary Fig. 8) assessed at the treatment endpoint (day 24) 
corroborate the enhanced local control of the primary tumour as found in the subcutaneous 
model for PMILs (Fig. 5d).
These orthotopic pancreatic tumours are hypovascular in comparison to the surrounding 
pancreatic tissue (Figs. 6a,b). Nevertheless, XL184 (P = 0.19, Mann-Whitney U test) and 
PMIL-treatment (P = 0.20, Mann-Whitney U test) selectively induced trends in reduced 
intratumoural—but not peritumoural—microvessel density versus the no-treatment control 
tumours (Fig. 6b). Because of the substantial degree of tumour shrinkage by PMILs (Fig. 
5d), which tends to compact remaining vasculature and to obscure interpretation of 
microvessel density37, we also estimated the intratumoural microvessel volume using an 
immunofluorescence and digital slide scanning microscopy technique to efficiently sample 
the endothelial cell content of entire tumour volumes38 (Methods and Supplementary Note 
9). The intratumoural microvessel volume estimate revealed a significant reduction in total 
tumour microvascularity achieved by the PMIL, which suggests an antivascular effect 
facilitated by PDT with suppression of vascular and tumour regrowth by sustained XL184 
release. Furthermore, invasive tumour borders and metastatic infiltrates within the 
surrounding pancreatic tissue characterize this orthotopic model of PDAC (Fig. 6a). 
Metastases in the liver and retroperitoneal lymph nodes appear rapidly in this model, as 
assessed by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay (Methods) that measures the 
number of viable, human metastatic cancer cells in organ biopsies (Fig. 6d). The single 
PMIL treatment achieved a 98.7% mean reduction in liver and retroperitoneal lymph node 
metastasis compared to the no-treatment control group at the treatment endpoint (day 24), 
while the other treatment groups did not achieve a statistically significant change in 
metastasis (Fig. 6d).
The local tumour reduction and suppression of metastasis resulting from a single PMIL 
treatment contrasts with the use of XL184 as a single agent, which is given daily over an 
extended period by oral administration. For instance, Sennino et al. reported 99% primary

 tumour reduction, 79% microvessel density reduction and 100% liver metastasis reduction in 
a mouse model of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (40 mg·kg−1 XL184, administered 
daily for 3 wks)16. Here, a single PMIL treatment (including 0.1–0.125 mg·kg−1 XL184) 
achieved 92% and 61% reductions of subcutaneous and orthotopic PDAC tumours, 
respectively, with 70% intratumoural microvessel volume reduction and 99% metastatic 
cancer cell reduction in the liver and regional lymph nodes. Remarkably, the interaction of 
PDT with photo-initiated and sustained XL184 release facilitated by the PMIL enables the 
same therapeutic efficacy of daily oral XL184 monotherapy with less than a thousandth 
(~1/6,700th) of the XL184 dosage (Supplementary Note 10). This indicates that the PMILs 
offer a significant potential to reduce systemic exposure to XL184, reducing risks of toxic 
side effects and the need for dose interruptions.
The in vivo efficacy PMIL also contrasts strongly with co-administration of L[BPD] and 
NP[XL184] as separate agents. The PMIL unites the pharmacokinetics of L[BPD] and 
NP[XL184] delivery and enables tumour-confined, photo-induced XL184 release, while the 
conventional delivery of L[BPD] and NP[XL184] precludes a full interaction between these 
therapies. The enhanced efficacy of the PMIL highlights the importance of co-packaging 
interactive therapeutic agents into one carrier with spatiotemporally synchronized release. 
Note that although XL184 had no cytotoxicity as a single agent in vitro (Fig. 4d) that PMIL 
treatment achieved super-additive cancer cell killing both in vitro and in vivo 
(Supplementary Fig. 7), which suggests a synergistic interaction between XL184 and BPD-
PDT facilitated by the PMIL (Supplementary Note 11). The requirement for co-packaging to 
achieve maximal impact is likely due to rapid (within 1–4 h) microvessel damage and 
shutdown by both XL18439 and BPD27 that mutually compromise co-delivery of these 
therapies as separate agents using conventional drug delivery formulations. The rapid 
vascular effects of PDT in particular (<1 h for blood flow stasis onset with a duration >48 
h27) would preclude XL184 delivery during the critical time window for anti-apoptotic 
signalling and vascular regrowth inhibition during the burst in tumour VEGF (within 6 h40) 
and MET (within 72 h; Supplementary Fig. 1) signalling that follows cytotoxic therapy. 
Rapid PDT-induced vascular shutdown would inhibit overall XL184 delivery (55 h half-life) 
whereas nanoparticles entrapped in the tumour release XL184 locally for a sustained period 
to inhibit vascular regrowth and metastasis following PDT. XL184 could be administered 
prior to PDT but this still precludes sustained therapeutic doses of XL184 until tumour 
vascular regrowth following PDT.
Conclusions
In summary, the complexities of cancer necessitate the innovation of drug delivery platforms 
capable of addressing multiple tumour compartments as well as treatment escape 
mechanisms. An emerging paradigm in cancer therapy suggests that gains in local tumour 
control can be compromised by co-activation of multiple tumour survival signalling 
pathways that promote increased invasiveness and metastasis5,8. This aggressive response to 
treatment may ultimately limit patient survival. Combination therapies hold great promise 
for overcoming this paradox by addressing mechanisms of tumour recurrence and treatment 
escape. However, co-activation of multiple tumour survival signalling pathways and 
microvessel shutdown limit the efficacy of sequential drug delivery. New drug delivery

 systems are needed to facilitate combinations spanning cytotoxic, antivascular and anti-
invasive mechanisms. To address these challenges, we developed PMILs that integrate the 
antivascular and antiangiogenic mechanisms of photodynamic and anti-VEGF therapy while 
blocking tumour cell invasion, metastasis and escape via the MET pathway. This approach is 
inspired by recent advances in photoactivated nanomaterials2,4, multi-drug loaded41 as well 
as stimuli-responsive liposomes42 and by the nanocell platform43, which introduced 
extrinsically-activated drug release, maintenance of synergistic drug ratios and temporal 
targeting of distinct tumour compartments, respectively. PMILs utilize these features for 
multi-agent co-delivery with photo-release and entrapment of NP[XL184] within the tumour 
following vascular shutdown for sustained release. This approach uniquely enables a 
tumour-confined, spatiotemporally synchronized multi-modal combination therapy at the 
“right time and right place”. The PMIL attenuates metastatic outgrowth and escape but the 
photodynamic component is presently limited to localized tumours and further developments 
will be needed to address established, distal metastases. Note that XL184 is eventually 
released from the PMIL in the dark (Fig. 2f) such that established metastases will be 
impacted by passive tumour accumulation of PMILs via the enhanced permeability and 
retention effect.
Future work will address models of advanced metastatic disease and will potentially involve 
further developments to incorporate targeted and activatable delivery for wide-field PDT 
with sufficient selectivity to treat disseminated micrometastases44. The role of the 
unencapsulated NP[XL184] population, and the possibility of a BPD-loaded lipid monolayer 
that contributes to light-activated therapy, will also be the subject of future studies. 
Alternatively, it is possible that the encapsulated NP[XL184] is the dominant contributor 
such that further reduction in the XL184 dose and systemic toxicity may be achieved by 
purification of encapsulated NP[XL184]. Collectively, the present study demonstrates that 
PMILs maximize therapeutic efficacy per treatment cycle and further studies are warranted 
to investigate long-term impacts on cure rate, survival and potentiation of standard 
chemotherapy regimens. The on-going phase II-III studies of PDT in PDAC form a good 
basis for developing this approach further.
METHODS
NP[XL184] synthesis and characterization
Prior to NP[XL184] synthesis, the biodegradable copolymer PLGA 50:50 (17 kDa; 0.18 
dL·g−1; Lake Shore Biomaterials) was modified to incorporate a PEG moiety (COOH-PEG-
NH2; 3.5 kDa; JenKem Technology), which enhances both nanoparticle stability and 
circulation time18. Synthesis was then performed by nanoprecipitation45. In order to achieve 
maximal XL184 loading, nanoparticles were synthesized with various XL184 (>99.0% 
purity; Selleck Chemicals) and PEG-PLGA drug/polymer ratios ranging from 1–10% (w/w). 
Of the tested ratios, the XL184 molar loading efficiency was maximal at a drug/polymer 
(w/w) ratio of 1% (Supplemental Figure 2). In addition, a range of solvent:water ratios (1:2–
1:10) were tested and the optimal ratio for NP[XL184] formation was 1:3 acetone:water. For 
the optimized synthesis protocol, XL184 was co-solubilized in 1 mL of acetone with PLGA-
PEG at a 1% (w/w) drug to polymer concentration. Nanoprecipitation was achieved by

 adding this mixture drop-wise using a 27½-gauge needle to 3 mL of H2O stirred 
magnetically at 400 rpm. The reaction mixture was then stirred uncovered for 6 h to allow 
acetone evaporation, passed through a 0.2 μm filter and purified by ultrafiltration (Amicon-
Millipore; 30 kDa cut-off) at 2500 rpm for 10 min with intermittent washing (4 cycles; 4 mL 
phosphate-buffered saline per wash). The XL184–PLGA nanoparticle loading efficiency was 
determined by optical absorption measurements following solvation of the nanoparticles in 
dimethyl sulfoxide, using the formula: 100·(no. moles following purification/no. moles 
available for synthesis). All NP[XL184] size and charge measurements were made by 
dynamic light scattering (Malvern, Zetasizer Nano ZS).
PMIL synthesis and characterization
PMILs co-encapsulating BPD (verteporfin; VWR International) and NP[XL184] were 
prepared by modification of existing synthesis methods43. The lipids (DPPC, DOTAP, 
cholesterol, and DSPE-PEG; Avanti Polar Lipids) were each dissolved separately in 
chloroform, and then mixed together in a molar ratio of 2:0.2:1:0.2 
(DPPC:DOTAP:cholesterol:DSPE-PEG) with 100 nmoles of BPD. This lipid composition 
was selected based on the previously reported pharmacological success of similar 
compositions18. Inclusion of the cationic lipid, DOTAP, resulted in a zeta potential (surface 
charge) of +3 mV. This slightly cationic surface charge promotes cellular uptake without 
significant cytotoxicity to maintain biocompatibility46. To form thin lipid films containing 
BPD, chloroform was removed by roto-evaporation and by placing the sample under vacuum 
overnight. Next, lipid film hydration was achieved by adding NP[XL184] (50 nmoles of 
XL184) in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline. To ensure adequate encapsulation of 
NP[XL184], the thin film was subjected to 10 freeze-thaw cycles (6 min per cycle) at 0°C 
and 45°C, below and above the highest transition temperature of the lipid mixture (DPPC; 
Tm = 41°C). The resulting dispersion of multilamellar liposomes was extruded through a 
200-nm-diameter polycarbonate membrane using a mini-extruder system (Avanti Polar 
Lipids) to form unilamellar liposomes. BPD and XL184 not loaded into the PMIL were 
removed by dialysis (Spectra/Por; 300 kDa cut-off; 1 mL sample in 4 L of phosphate-
buffered saline at 4°C for 18 h). During the dialysis period, the sample was analysed by 
dynamic light scattering measurements. Initially, these measurements indicated a bimodal 
distribution with peaks at 80 nm (NP[XL184]) and 150 nm (PMIL), which gradually became 
a single monodispersive peak (PDI < 0.2) as purification of the PMILs completed. However, 
electron microscopy revealed the presence of residual NP[XL184] not incorporated within 
liposomes within the PMIL samples (Supplementary Note 3). The PMIL BPD and XL184 
concentrations and loading efficiencies were determined by fluorescence and absorbance 
spectroscopy or by high-performance liquid chromatography (Hydrosil C18 ODS; 2.0 cm × 
14.0 cm; 50% acetonitrile in H2O → 100% acetonitrile; 0.5 h), respectively, following 
solvation of the PMILs in dimethyl sulfoxide. All PMIL size and charge measurements were 
made by dynamic light scattering (Malvern, Zetasizer Nano ZS). L[BPD] was synthesized 
analogously to the PMIL, but without NP[XL184].
PMIL stability and drug photo-release kinetics
PMIL and NP[XL184] size stability during storage at 4°C was investigated by repeated 
dynamic light scattering measurements over a period of 40 d (Supplementary Fig. 3). Dark

 release and photoinduced drug release were measured using dialysis membranes in 
phosphate-buffered saline at 37°C with 10% fetal bovine serum added to each dialysis tube 
(Spectra/Por; NP[XL184], 100 kDa cut-off; PMILs, 300 kDa cutoff; Fig. 2f). A 690 nm 
diode laser (High Power Devices, Inc.) was used for all NIR irradiation experiments. During 
dialysis samples were collected periodically and placed immediately in acetonitrile 
containing 1% of the internal standard N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine. Separation and 
quantification of drug components was achieved by liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using standard curves for each drug normalized to the internal 
standard. Briefly, 1.0 μL of dialysis sample was injected into a ZorbaxC18 (2.1 × 50 mm) 
column eluted at 0.400 mL/min with acetonitrile and 10 mM ammonium formate (80% → 
20% over 4 min). Detection of drug components was made using triple quadrupole MS/MS 
detection with an ion source ESI+ in MRM scan mode to identify the product ions for BPD 
(ret. time = 4.12 min, 513 m/z) and XL184 (ret. time= 2.68 min, 232 m/z). Quantitative 
analysis of chromatograms allowed for area under curve integrations of each product ion 
normalized to the internal standard (ret. time 1.20 min; 170 m/z). Total moles were 
determined using standard curves and percent loss calculated for each time point after 
correcting for sample volume changes. The resulting BPD and XL184 release profiles were 
fit individually to a simple one- or two-phase exponential model: a0 + a1 · e−k1·t + a2 · e−k2·t, 
where a0 is an offset, a1 and a2 are the maxima release plateaus (at equilibrium) of phases 1 
and 2, k1 and k2 are the release rate constants of phases 1 and 2, and t is time from placing 
the sample in serum media within the dialysis tube. Note that XL184 release from 
NP[XL184] is sufficiently described by a single-phase model (P=0.067, two-phase 
alternative hypothesis), whereas XL184 release from the PMIL with or without laser 
irradiation is best described by the multi-phase model (P =0.0003–0.0079). Dynamic light 
scattering and transmission electron microscopy were also performed before and after 
photoirradiation (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4).
Cryo-electron microscopy
Cryo-EM was performed using a FEI Technai G2 Polara microscope equipped with an 
energy filter (Gatan) and a K2 Summit direct detection device (Gatan). Briefly, 5 μL of 
nanomaterial sample (~60 μM BPD for the PMIL or L[BPD]; ~30 or 125 μM XL184 for the 
PMIL or NP[XL184], respectively) mixed with 2 μL of BSA Gold Tracer (EM-grade 6 nm; 
Electron Microscopy Sciences, 25484) re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline were 
deposited onto glow-discharged holey carbon grids (QUANTIFOIL R 2/1 200 mesh, copper; 
Electron Microscopy Sciences), blotted and rapidly vitrified in a liquid ethane and propane 
mixture (50:50) using a custom-built plunger (Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, 
Germany). Imaging was performed at 300 kV under low-dose conditions with 4.98 Å or 6.12 
Å sampling and a defocus of −3 or −6 μm for 2D or 3D images, respectively. 2D images 
were obtained using the dose-fractionation mode of the detector (~20–40 e/Å2 cumulative 
dose). Tilt series (±60°) for tomography were collected around a single axis with a 2° 
sampling increment using SerialEM software47 (~100 e/Å2 cumulative dose). Tomographic 
reconstructions were calculated using the IMOD tomography package48. Renders of 3D 
PMIL and NP[XL184] objects were created by manual segmentation in IMOD and rendered 
using VMD49. Manual particle counting was performed as described in Supplementary Fig. 
5. Only unambiguous NP[XL184] objects were counted (~20 nm in diameter or greater).

 Mean lamellarity was calculated as: ΣL(NL · L)/ΣLNL, where NL is the number of objects 
with lamellarity L (e.g., L = 1 for unilamellar liposomes).
Transmission electron microscopy
TEM (Philips CM10) was performed using negative staining either on untreated (200 mesh 
nickel PELCO® Support Film with a Formvar/carbon coating, Ted Pella Inc.) or ionized 
carbon coated grids (to promote sample adhesion). Briefly, 10 μL of sample was added to 
the grid, air-dried and stained (2 μL, 1.0% phosphotungstic acid). Next, the grid was blotted 
dry and washed with 5 μL of dH2O. Imaging was performed at 100.0 kV and magnifications 
of ~10,000–50,000×.
Cell culture studies
Monolayer cultures of AsPC1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, CRL-1682; low 
passage number, <20)—recently tested (July 2015) and found to be negative for 
mycoplasma contamination (MycoAlert mycoplasma detection kit, Lonza)—were 
maintained in media (RPMI 1640, Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum 
(Invitrogen), 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. The AsPC1 cell line has 
not been listed in the database of cross-contaminated or misidentified cell lines maintained 
by the International Cell Line Authentication Committee. Cellular uptake of PMILs and 
L[BPD] was tested in multi-well plates with coverslip bottoms (Greiner Bio-One) plated 
with AsPC1 cells allowed to attach and grow overnight. Nanoconstructs were added to the 
wells at staggered time points to reach a concentration of 100 nM BPD and to achieve 
varying incubation times at 37°C (15–90 min). Imaging was performed with an Olympus 
FV1000 confocal microscope with a 20 × 0.75 NA (numerical aperture) objective. BPD 
excitation was performed using a 405 nm diode laser with an emission spectrograph centred 
on the 696 nm BPD fluorescence emission peak. The laser, photomultiplier tube detector 
and pinhole settings, as well as brightness-contrast adjustment settings for display, were kept 
constant for all images. In addition, phase contrast images were collected during microscopy 
in order to focus on a high-density field of cells (not shown). Images were also collected for 
untreated cells (0 min) to quantify the autofluorescence background and to define a 
fluorescence intensity threshold that rejects 99.5% of the background signal. This intensity 
threshold was applied to all images to select pixels above the autofluorescence background 
(true BPD signal) for analysis. The resulting cellular uptake data was fit to a simple 
biexponential pharmacokinetic model: a · (e−k·t − e−j·t), where k and j are the elimination and 
absorption rate constants, a is a coefficient dependent on the administered BPD dose as well 
as its bioavailability and t is time post-administration. For in vitro PDT, 0.25·106 AsPC1 
cells were grown on a 35-mm culture dish for 24 h and incubated with nanoconstructs 
containing BPD (250 nM equivalent) and/or XL184 (100–125 nM equivalent) in 1 mL 
complete medium for 1 h. The incubation media was then replaced with 2 mL of fresh, 
complete media prior to photoirradiation. This removal of nanoconstructs not uptaken by 
cells prior to irradiation limits the release of XL184 and the generation of photocytotoxic 
species to intracellular and cell-associated nanoconstructs. Cell viability was measured using 
the MTT assay 24 h following light irradiation. Singlet Oxygen Sensor Green (SOSG; 
Molecular Probes) and D-mannitol (Sigma-Aldrich) were used to probe reactive oxygen 
species involvement in BPD-PDT-induce MET activation. Tyrphostin AG1478 (Sigma-

 Aldrich) and bacterial toxin B (Toxin B, Clostridium difficile - Calbiochem, Millipore) were 
used to test for involvement of enzymes known to participate in MET transactivation. SOSG 
and mannitol were added to cells immediately prior to laser irradiation in fresh media and 
then removed immediately after PDT by a second media replacement step. AG1478 and 
toxin B were incubated with cells in fresh media for 30 min and 2 h, respectively, prior to 
laser irradiation and then removed immediately after PDT by a second media replacement.
In vivo mouse models and treatments
All animal experiments were conducted with approval and according to guidelines 
established by the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee. Experiments were carried out on 6-week-old male Swiss nude mice weighing 
20–25 grams (Cox Breeding Laboratories). For tumour implantations and photoirradiation, 
animals were anesthetized with 84 mg·kg−1 ketamine and 12 mg·kg−1 xylazine. Tumours 
were implanted by injection of a 50 μL volume containing 106 AsPC1 cells in a 1:1 mixture 
of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and culture media. Subcutaneous tumours were implanted 
above the hind leg and tumour volumes were estimated longitudinally by measuring the 
three tumour dimensions using a calliper and the hemi-ellipsoid formula: volume = π · L · W 
· H/6, where L, W and H, are the tumour length, width and height. Note that here, H, 
represents the measured height of the hemi-elliptical tumour, which is half the height of a 
full ellipsoid. Eighteen days following cancer cell implantation, subcutaneous tumours 
reached volumes of ~50 mm3 prior to the start of treatment. For orthotopic tumour 
implantation, animals were laid supine, a small left abdominal flank incision was made to 
exteriorize the pancreas and the cell suspension was injected into the pancreas. A small 
amount of 10% povidone/iodine was applied topically to the injection site. Then the incision 
was closed with 4-0 sutures and 10% povidone/iodine was then applied to the incision site to 
prevent infection. Ten days after cancer cell implantation, orthotopic pancreatic tumours 
reached volumes of ~25 mm3 prior to the start of treatment. All injections for treatment were 
done intravenously (tail vein) in 200 μL sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Mice were 
randomized into the various treatment groups, and the tumours of mice receiving BPD were 
irradiated with NIR light (using the 690 nm diode laser listed above) 1 h post-injection, 
delivered at an irradiance of 100 mW·cm−2. Subcutaneous tumours were irradiated 
transcutaneously while orthotopic tumours were surgically exposed as for tumour 
implantation and irradiated. Fourteen days after treatment, orthotopic tumours were excised 
to estimate their volumes using callipers and the ellipsoid formula: volume = π · L · W · H/6.
Microvessel immunofluorescence imaging
Microvessel density and intratumoural microvessel volume were estimated as described 
previously38. Briefly, orthotopic pancreatic tumours were excised 2 weeks post-treatment, 
embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound and frozen at −80°C. A cryotome was 
used to cut 20-μm-thick cryosections. Sections were (1) fixed in 1:1 acetone:methanol for 15 
minutes at −20°C, (2) air dried for 30 minutes, and (3) washed three times in phosphate-
buffered saline. A blocking solution (Dako Protein Block Reagent) was applied for 30 
minutes, followed by application of the immunostains, at ~5 μg/mL monoclonal antibody 
(MAb) each diluted in background reducing Dako Antibody Diluent for 2 h at room 
temperature in a humidifying chamber. Finally, the slides were washed again three times,

 mounted (Invitrogen SlowFade Gold with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, DAPI) with a 
coverslip and sealed with nail polish. Confocal fluorescence imaging was performed using 
an Olympus FluoView 1000 confocal microscope with a 10 × 0.4 numerical aperture (NA) 
or a 20× 0.75 NA objective. Excitation of DAPI, anti-mouse PECAM-1 (CD31; clone 390; 
CBL1337, Millipore) MAb-Alexa Fluor 568 conjugates and anti-human cytokeratin 8 (clone 
LP3K; MAB3156, R&D Systems) MAb-Alexa Fluor 647 conjugates was carried out using 
405-, 559- and 635-nm lasers, respectively. Mosaic images of entire tumour cross-sections 
were collected and stitched together using the Olympus FluoView software. The anti-human 
cytokeratin 8 stain (a cytoskeletal protein highly expressed by AsPC1 cells) has dual 
selectivity for the epithelial cancer cells because it does not react with mouse proteins. All 
analyses were performed using custom MATLAB (Mathworks) routines for batch image 
processing38. Microvessel density values were calculated from whole tumour sections, 
within viable tumour tissue only, and averaged over slices from the entire tumour rather than 
a more complex “hot spot” identification and calculation, which is difficult to define 
objectively38. Intratumoural microvessel volume is calculated by multiplying microvessel 
density with the viable tumour volume in each slice and then summing over the whole 
tumour by interpolation38. Here, we used the minimum tumour subsampling necessary—
based on a mathematical model—to resolve a statistically significant change in 
intratumoural microvessel volume, as validated previously using the orthotopic AsPC1 
tumour model38 (Supplementary Note 9).
Measurement of metastatic burden
A quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay was 
performed on excised liver and iliac lymph nodes to estimate the number of human cancer 
cells in excised organs as described and validated previously44. Briefly, qRT-PCR is used to 
measure the total number of human cancer cells from the level of human and mouse 
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) housekeeping genes. At least 300 mg 
of freshly excised liver and retroperitoneal lymph nodes were collected at the treatment 
endpoint and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen samples were then pulverized and 
homogenized, followed by RNA extraction (RNAeasy Plus Mini Kit; Qiagen). Human and 
mouse GAPDH gene were measured using custom synthesized primers (Invitrogen). For 
each specimen, the cycle threshold (Ct) from human GAPDH gene was normalized by Ct 
from mouse GAPDH gene. The normalized Ct was quantified into number of cancer cells 
using a standard curve generated with a set of organ lysates from no-tumour control mice 
mixed with different numbers of human cancer cells.
Statistical analyses
Specific statistical tests are indicated in the figure captions and were carried out using 
GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software). All reported P values are two-tailed. Parametric tests 
(one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test) were used for in vitro drug release (Fig. 2f and 
Supplementary Fig. 4) and in vitro cell culture (Figs. 4b,c,d and Supplementary Fig. 6) 
studies; and, the D’Agostino & Pearson omnibus normality test (α = 0.05; requires n ≥ 8 
replicates per group) did not identify significant deviations from normality within these data 
sets (testing could only performed for groups with n ≥ 8 replicates). Note that all groups 
within the drug release data were analysed together (some groups appear only in

 Supplementary Fig. 4). Electron microscopy single-nanoparticle analysis (Figs. 3d) and all 
in vivo data (Figs. 5b,c,d, Figs. 6b,c,d and Supplementary Fig. 1) were analysed using 
nonparametric tests (the Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA). The 
Brown–Forsythe test (α = 0.05) was applied to all data sets with n ≥ 3 replicates to test for 
equal variance (regardless of whether parametric or nonparametric analysis was used) and 
identified significant deviations from equal variance (Figs. 3e, 5d and 6c). In these cases, the 
data were analysed following a logarithmic transform of the data to pass the Brown–
Forsythe test. Two-way ANOVA was applied to test for synergistic treatment interactions50 
(Fig. 5d) following a natural logarithm transform of the data to pass the D’Agostino & 
Pearson omnibus normality test. No exclusion criteria were used, and no data points or 
animals were excluded from analysis. Investigators were not blinded to experimental groups 
unless noted otherwise. Animal sample sizes were selected to ensure adequate power (80%) 
to detect a 20% difference using a maximum of 16 animals per group assuming a standard 
deviation of 15%. For the subcutaneous model, significance was achieved with 5 animals per 
group.

 Figure 1. Concepts of spatiotemporal-synchronized combination therapy using PMILs
a, NIR light activates PMILs within the tumour microvasculature and parenchyma for 
simultaneous neovascular damage, tumour cell apoptosis and necrosis as well as liposome 
disruption with initiation of sustained multikinase inhibition. The PMIL delivery system is 
tuneable for simultaneous delivery of photodynamic, chemotherapeutics and small-
molecular inhibitors. b, Schematic of a three-way interactive combination therapy with 
photodynamic tumour cell and microvasculature damage and inhibition of treatment escape 
pathways. VEGFR signalling stimulates tumour angiogenesis and preparation of the 
premetastatic niche via supporting endothelial cell survival, migration and proliferation as 
well as increased vessel permeability and chemotaxis of bone marrow derived progenitor 
cells. MET signalling promotes escape from cytotoxic and antiangiogenic therapy via 
supporting cancer cell survival, motility and metastasis as well as cancer stem-like cell 
maintenance and tumour angiogenesis via cross talk with the VEGFR pathway. XL184 
inhibits activation of both the MET and VEGF signalling pathways to suppress tumour cell 
survival, metastasis and regrowth following cytotoxic therapy.

 J·cm−2), whereas there is no significant change in overall MET protein expression following 
PDT over a range of PDT doses (Supplementary Fig. 6). A singlet oxygen-specific 
scavenger (Singlet Oxygen Sensor Green, SOSG; 100 μM) inhibits L[BPD]-PDT activation 
of MET signalling, whereas a free radical scavenger (mannitol, 50 mM) has only a modest 
affect. In addition, an EGFR-specific kinase inhibitor, AG1478 (12.5 nM), also inhibits MET 
activation following PDT whereas toxin B (2 ng/mL), an inhibitor of GPCR-mediated MET 
transactivation, has no effect. Results are mean ± s.e.m. Underlined asterisks denote 
significance compared to no treatment, and the remaining asterisks denote significance 
compared to L[BPD]-PDT, L[BPD] (h ν), or amongst the indicated groups (n = 3 biological 
replicates per condition; ***P <0.001, ****P <0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-
hoc test). c, Western blots and quantification of photo-induced suppression of MET

BPD; 690 nm; 100 mW·cm−2; 1 J·cm−2). Without photo-induced XL184 release (PMIL, 
−hν), the PMIL has no affect on basal levels of pMET. Results are mean ± s.e.m. (n = 2 
biological replicates per condition; **P <0.01, ***P <0.001, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s 
post-hoc test). d, MTT assay of AsPC1 cell viability following XL184 and PDT

significance compared to no treatment or amongst the indicated groups (No-treatment 
control and L[BPD] 0 J·cm−2, n = 17 biological replicates; XL184, n = 10 biological

way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test). Fisher’s least significant difference post-hoc test 
of the integrated PDT dose response curves (analysis of the area under the curve mean and 
standard error) indicates that the PMIL achieves enhanced cancer cell death versus L[BPD] 
+ NP[XL184] (P <0.05) and L[BPD] (P <0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 7a).

 Figure 5. Prolonged tumour reduction in vivo with a single cycle of PMIL-treatment
Combined BPD-PDT (690 nm; 100 mW·cm−2; 75 J·cm−2) and XL184 treatment using 
PMILs achieves, a, prolonged reductions in subcutaneous tumour volumes, b, with a 
minimal fractional residual tumour on day 37. The arrow in a indicates administration of a 
single treatment cycle. Results are mean ± s.e.m. Error is small where hidden. Asterisks in b 
denote significance compared to no treatment (n = 5 mice per group; ***P = 0.0038, 
Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA). Orthotopic PDAC mouse, c, weight change (compared to 
10 d posttumour inoculation, prior to treatment) and, d, pancreatic tumour volume at the 
experiment endpoint (37 d following tumour inoculation). Results are mean ± s.e.m. 
Asterisks denote significance compared to no treatment or amongst the indicated groups (n = 
16 mice per group; *P <0.05, **P <0.01, ***P <0.001, Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA). A 
single cycle of combination therapy using PMILs achieves enhanced reductions in 
orthotopic tumours (P = 0.011, two-way ANOVA BPD-PDT·XL184 interaction term; 
Supplementary Fig. 7b and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2)—but not using the conventional 
combination, L[BPD] + NP[XL184] (P = 0.23).
