Cancer cells are known to execute reprogramed metabolism of glucose, amino acids and lipids. Here, we report a significant role of
cholesterol metabolism in cancer metastasis. By using label-free Raman spectromicroscopy, we found an aberrant accumulation of
cholesteryl ester in human pancreatic cancer specimens and cell lines, mediated by acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT-1)
enzyme. Expression of ACAT-1 showed a correlation with poor patient survival. Abrogation of cholesterol esterification, either by an
ACAT-1 inhibitor or by shRNA knockdown, significantly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic mouse model of
pancreatic cancer. Mechanically, ACAT-1 inhibition increased intracellular free cholesterol level, which was associated with elevated
endoplasmic reticulum stress and caused apoptosis. Collectively, our results demonstrate a new strategy for treating metastatic
pancreatic cancer by inhibiting cholesterol esterification.

INTRODUCTION
Metastasis is the major cause of cancer-related mortality. Though
localized tumors can often be treated by surgery or other
therapies, treatment options for metastatic diseases are limited.
Cancer metastasis has been revealed to be a multiple step
process, including cancer cell migration, local invasion, intravasa-
tion, circulation through blood and lymph vessels, extravasation,
survival and colonization in distant organs.1–3 Mediators identified
in these processes have provided the basis for the development of
therapies to target metastasis. Current therapeutic strategies for
treating metastatic tumors mainly focus on targeting the adhesive
molecules and extracellular proteases.4 However, these therapeu-
tics have not been proven to be effective in clinical trials, partially
owing to the various escape mechanisms used by the metastatic
cancer cells.2,5,6 Thus, an unmet need exists to develop new
therapeutic strategies for treating metastatic cancers.
Recent advances in cancer metabolism have unveiled many
potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Metabolic
reprogramming, a strategy used by cancer cells to adapt to the
rapid proliferation, is being recognized as a new hallmark of
cancer.7 Substantial studies have found increased glycolysis,
glutaminolysis, nucleotide and lipid synthesis in cancer cells.7–10
Considering that altered metabolic pathways only happen in
cancer cells but not in normal cells, targeting these pathways may
provide cancer-specific treatments. A number of inhibitors of
metabolic enzymes, such as glycolysis inhibitors, are under clinical
trials as targeted cancer therapeutics.11
Of various metabolic pathways, lipid metabolism has been
suggested to have an important role in cancer cell migration,
invasion and metastasis.12 A recent study reported that surround-
ing adipocytes provide energy source for ovarian cancer cells to
promote its rapid growth and metastasis.13 Blocking lipid de novo
synthesis pathway has been shown to suppress tumor regrowth
and metastasis after anti-angiogenesis treatment withdrawal.14
In parallel, lipolysis by the enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase was
shown to regulate the fatty acid network, which promotes cancer
cell migration, invasion and growth.15
Cholesterol, a critical component of the plasma membrane, is
also implied to be correlated to cancer metastasis.16 It has been
shown that prostate cancer bone metastases contain a high level of
cholesterol.17 Modulation of cholesterol level in plasma membrane
was shown to regulate the capability of cell migration.18,19
Moreover, cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts were shown to have an
essential role in cancer cell adhesion and migration.20 Mammalian
cells obtain cholesterol either from de novo synthesis or from the
uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL).21 Inside cells, excess free
cholesterol is esterified and stored as cholesteryl ester (CE) in lipid
droplets (LDs), which is mediated by acyl-CoA cholesterol acyl-
transferase (ACAT).22 Increased CE level has been reported in breast
cancer,23 leukemia,24 glioma25 and prostate cancer.26 Despite these
advances, the role of cholesterol esterification in cancer progression,
especially in cancer metastasis, is not well understood.
In this article, we report a link between cholesterol esterification
and metastasis in pancreatic cancer. Using stimulated Raman
scattering (SRS) microscopy and Raman spectroscopy to map
LDs stored inside single cells and analyze the composition of
individual LDs, we identified an aberrant accumulation of CE in
human pancreatic cancer specimens and cell lines. Abrogation of
cholesterol esterification, either by inhibiting ACAT-1 enzyme
activity or by shRNA knockdown of ACAT-1 expression, signifi-
cantly reduced pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis in an
orthotopic mouse model. Mechanistically, inhibition of cholesterol
esterification disturbed cholesterol homeostasis by increasing
intracellular free cholesterol level, which was associated with

RESULTS
Aberrant accumulation of CE in human pancreatic cancer tissues
and cell lines, but not in normal counterparts
Using Raman spectromicroscopy, we mapped lipid distribution
and analyzed the composition in individual LDs inside single cells.
Cryo-sections of matched normal and cancerous human pancreatic
tissues from same patients were used, of which the pathological
status was confirmed by a pathologist. Totally, 14 pairs of matched
normal and cancerous tissues were imaged and analyzed. Our
SRS imaging revealed a much higher level of LD accumulation
in cancerous pancreatic tissues than in normal tissues (Figure 1a).
To make sure that the images were taken from the cancer cells, but
not the stromal cells, histologically stained adjacent slides were used
to identify the cancer cells. By quantitative analysis of the SRS
images, we showed that the amount of LDs in cancer tissues is over
20 times higher than that in normal tissues (Figure 1b).
To assess the composition of LDs in cancer and normal tissues,
we acquired Raman spectra from individual LDs inside the cells
(Figure 1c). The LDs in pancreatic cancer cells contained high
levels of CE, indicated by the characteristic ester bond vibration
mode at 1742 cm − 1 and the cholesterol ring vibration mode at
702 cm − 1.27 Multiple Raman spectra from individual LDs in the
same cells were recorded to ensure consistency (Supplementary
Figure S1A). It is worth noting that spectra from normal tissues
showed no peak at 702 cm − 1 but a strong peak at 2930 cm − 1,
indicating high protein content in those LDs. Using emulsions
mixed by cholesteryl oleate and glyceryl trioleate, we verified that
height ratio of the Raman peak at 702 cm − 1 to the peak at
1442 cm − 1 (CH2 bending vibration mode) is linearly proportional
to the molar percentage of CE (Supplementary Figure S1B). On the
basis of this calibration curve, we found that the percentage of CE
in pancreatic cancer tissues ranged from 60 to 95%, while the
percentage in normal tissues was within 10 ~ 20% (Figure 1d).
To
further
validate
our
Raman
spectral
measurements,
we used mass spectrometry to analyze all CE species extracted
from the matched normal and cancer tissues. Two major forms
of CEs in normal and cancer tissues were identified to be CE 18:1
(for example, cholesteryl oleate) and CE 18:2 (for example,
cholesteryl linoleate) (Figure 1e). A quantitative analysis revealed
a significant increase of both CE 18:1 (Figure 1f) and CE 18:2
(Supplementary
Figure
S1C)
in
cancer
tissues
compared
with matched normal ones. Independently, increased levels
of CE in cancer tissues were confirmed by a colorimetric assay
(Supplementary Figure S1D). Next, we studied lipids in human
pancreatic cell lines, including normal immortalized pancreatic
epithelial cell line HPDE6, pancreatic cancer cell lines BxPC-3,
AsPC-1, MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1. Consistent with the human
specimen
data,
SRS
imaging
(Supplementary
Figure
S1E)
and Raman spectral analysis (Figure 1g) revealed higher CE
levels in cancer cells than in normal cells (Figure 1h). Collectively,
these data suggest that CE accumulation is a metabolic event
that occurs in pancreatic cancer cells but not in normal cells.
ACAT-1 mediates the accumulation of CE and positively correlates
with poor survival in pancreatic cancer patients
In mammalian cells, synthesis of CE from free cholesterol is mainly
catalyzed by acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT)
enzymes, ACAT-1 and ACAT-2 (Figure 2a), of which the latter one is
primarily expressed in intestinal mucosal cells in human.21,22 To test
which isoform contributes to the CE accumulation in pancreatic
cancers, we first examined the expression level of ACAT-1 and
ACAT-2 in matched normal and cancer human pancreatic tissues.
ACAT-1 expression was shown positive in cancer tissues, but
marginal in the normal counterparts (Supplementary Figure S2A). In
contrast, expression of ACAT-2 had no differences between normal
tissues and the matched cancer tissues (Supplementary Figure S2A),
implying that ACAT-2 may not be critical for CE generation in
pancreatic cancer cells. Higher expression levels of ACAT-1 were also
observed in MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells than HPDE6, BxPC-3 and
AsPC-1 cells (Figure 2b), which are positively correlated with their CE
levels. Then, a potent inhibitor of ACAT, avasimibe, was applied to
pancreatic cancer cells. As expected, inhibition of ACAT by avasimibe
effectively blocked CE accumulation in Mia PaCa-2 cells (Figures 2c
and d) and PANC-1 cells (Supplementary Figure S2B). Reduction of
CE by avasimibe was confirmed by mass spectrometry, which also
revealed that the principal form of CE in Mia PaCa-2 cells (Figure 2e)
and PANC-1 cells (Supplementary Figure S2C) was CE 18:1 (for
example, cholesteryl oleate). As avasimibe is known to inhibit both
ACAT-1 and ACAT-2,28 we conducted knockdown of ACAT-1 by
specific shRNA (Supplementary Figure S2D). As expected, ACAT-1
shRNA effectively suppressed CE accumulation in pancreatic cancer
cells (Figure 2f, Supplementary Figure S2E). These evidences
collectively support ACAT-1 is the major isoform that promotes the
CE accumulation in pancreatic cancers.
The overexpression of ACAT-1 in cancer tissues suggests
a potential role of ACAT-1 in pancreatic cancer progression.
To correlate ACAT-1 expression with patient outcome, we
performed immunohistochemistry of ACAT-1 in a pancreatic
cancer tissue array. Out of the 49 pieces of cancer tissues, 13
were identified as ACAT-1-negative (Figures 2g and i) and 36
were positive (Figures 2h and j). Importantly, the ACAT-1-
negative patients survived significantly longer than the ACAT-1-
positive patients (P = 0.042, Log Rank test), with a median
survival time of 25 months for ACAT-1-negative patients and
17 months for ACAT-1-positive patients (Figure 2k). These clinical
data suggest that ACAT-1 expression is a potential prognosis
marker for pancreatic cancer.
CE accumulation in pancreatic cancer is regulated by PTEN and
mediated by both de novo cholesterol synthesis and LDL uptake
Although higher levels of CE were found in pancreatic cancer
cell lines, our results showed that CE levels varied in different cell
lines. Specifically, MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells had much higher
levels of CE than AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells. As PTEN loss has been
shown to drive the CE accumulation in prostate cancer,26 we
asked whether the CE level in pancreatic cancer cell lines is
related to PTEN expression. We performed immunoblotting
analysis of PTEN and found much higher levels of PTEN in
CE-low HPDE6, AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells, but lower levels
of PTEN in CE-rich MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells, suggesting
a negative correlation between PTEN and CE level in pancreatic
cancer cells (Figure 3a). To determine whether PTEN regulates CE
accumulation, we conducted knockdown of PTEN by specific
shRNA in AsPC-1 cells (Supplementary Figure S3A) and induced
overexpression
of
wild-type
PTEN
in
MIA
PaCa-2
cells
(Supplementary Figure S3B). As expected, knockdown of PTEN
by shRNA significantly increased CE levels in AsPC-1 cells
(Figure 3b), while overexpression of wild-type PTEN significantly
reduced CE in MIA PaCa-2 cells (Figure 3c). The role of PTEN in
regulating CE levels is speculated to be through the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway, which is downstream of PTEN.29 Indeed,
inhibition of PI3K, Akt and mTOR by inhibitors significantly
reduced CE levels in MIA PaCa-2 cells (Figure 3d). It is also known
that mTOR complex regulates lipogenesis through controlling
the activity of Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins
(SREBPs).30 Consistently, knockdown of SREBP1 and SREBP2 by
siRNAs significantly reduced CE levels in MIA PaCa-2 cells
(Figure 3e). The effect of SREBP1 knockdown is more prominent
than SREBP2 knockdown, suggesting that SREBP1 is more
directly involved in CE accumulation in pancreatic cancer.

 Furthermore, knockdown of PTEN increased the expression of
mature form SREBP1 (Supplementary Figure S3C). Meanwhile,
overexpression of PTEN (Supplementary Figure S3D) or inhibi-
tion of PI3K/Akt/mTOR by inhibitors (Figure 3f) significantly
reduced the expression of mature form SREBP1. These data
collectively demonstrate that CE accumulation is regulated by
PTEN activity and subsequent activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/
SREBP signaling pathway.

 Cancer cells obtain cholesterol either from de novo synthesis or
by uptake of extracellular LDL.21 To investigate which pathway
contributes to CE accumulation in pancreatic cancer, we used
simvastatin, a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme
in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, to block the de novo

 synthesis pathway. We also applied lipodeficient serum to deplete
the extracellular cholesterol carried in LDLs. Either lipodeficient
serum supplementation or HMG-CoA reductase inhibition sig-
nificantly reduced the CE level (Figure 3g), indicating that both de
novo synthesis and LDL uptake pathways contribute to CE
accumulation in pancreatic cancer cells. Avasimibe treatment also
significantly reduced the uptake of LDL as shown by fluorescence
imaging (Supplementary Figure S3E) and quantitative analysis of
intracellular DiI-labeled LDL (Supplementary Figure S3F), indicat-
ing that LDL uptake is a tightly controlled process in response to
the regulation of cholesterol hemostasis. Together, our results
indicate that CE accumulation in pancreatic cancer arises from
both de novo synthesis and LDL uptake, and is mediated by the
ACAT-1 enzyme (Figure 3h).
Blocking cholesterol esterification suppresses pancreatic cancer
growth and metastasis
Considering that CE accumulation is a cancer-specific event, we
further tested whether cholesterol esterification could be a
potential target for cancer therapy. By using avasimibe, a potent
inhibitor of ACAT-1, we found that pancreatic cancer cells MIA
PaCa-2 and PANC-1 were much more sensitive to ACAT-1
inhibition than normal HPDE6 cells (Figure 4a, Supplementary
Figure S4A). The IC50 of avasimibe for MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1 and
HPDE6 are 11.03, 23.58 and 52.81 μM, respectively. Inhibition of

effect of avasimibe is specific to ACAT-1 inhibition, knockdown
of ACAT-1 by specific shRNA was performed. As predicted, MIA

 PaCa-2 cells with ACAT-1 knockdown showed a much-reduced
proliferation rate (Figure 4c). Using the Transwell method, we
further performed cell migration and invasion assays. Inhibition
of ACAT-1, either by avasimibe or shRNA knockdown, signifi-
cantly reduced MIA PaCa-2 cell migration and invasion rates
(Figures 4d and e). Together, these results show that cancer cells
are highly sensitive to blockage of cholesterol esterification.
Next, we deployed a well-established orthotopic mouse model
of pancreatic cancer31 to validate the anti-cancer effect of
ACAT-1 inhibitor in vivo. MIA PaCa-2 cells with luciferase and
mCherry
expression
were
orthotopically
injected
into
the
pancreas. Tumor growth was monitored weekly by In Vivo
Imaging System (IVIS) imaging by detecting the luminescence
signal in vivo. Avasimibe was prepared using a water-soluble
formulation by complexing with human serum albumin32 and
intraperitoneally injected at a dose of 15 mg/kg per day.
The results showed that avasimibe treatment for 4 weeks
remarkably suppressed tumor size, as indicated by luminescence
signal intensity (Figure 5a) and largely reduced tumor growth
rate (Figure 5b). Metastatic lesions in lymph nodes and distant
organs (for example, liver, spleen and lung) were also assessed
by IVIS imaging at the end point of the study (Figure 5c). Much
higher number of metastatic lesions in lymph nodes were
detected in the control group (15.0 ± 2.2, n = 8) than the
avasimibe-treated group (4.4 ± 1.7, n = 9). Each mouse in the
control group showed, at least, one metastatic lesion in the liver.
In contrast, only three mice in the avasimibe-treated group
showed single lesion in liver (Figure 5d). Ex vivo measurement of
tumor volume (Figure 5e) and tumor weight (Figure 5f) further
confirmed that avasimibe reduced tumor size and weight. SRS
imaging showed a decrease of the number of LDs (Figure 5g),
and Raman spectral analysis verified a significant reduction of CE
level in LDs (Figure 5h), suggesting that avasimibe acted by
blocking cholesterol esterification. Moreover, avasimibe did not
induce body weight loss (Figure 5i). The pathological assessment
also confirmed no apparent organ toxicity in liver, kidney, lung
and spleen, as shown by hematoxylin and eosin staining
(Supplementary Figure S5).
To testify that the anti-cancer effect of avasimibe is based on
ACAT-1 inhibition, an MIA PaCa-2luc/mCherry cell line with stable
knockdown of ACAT-1 was generated and applied to the
orthotopic mouse model. After 5 weeks of tumor cell inocula-
tion, the ACAT-1 knockdown cells developed significantly
smaller tumors compared with the ACAT-1 wild-type cells
(Figure 6a). Tumor growth was dramatically suppressed with
ACAT-1 knockdown (Figure 6b) while no obvious loss in body
weight was observed (Supplementary Figure S6A). As expected,
metastatic
lesions

lymph
nodes
and
distant
organs
(for example, liver, spleen and lung) were suppressed by

 were developed in each mouse of ACAT-1 wild-type group
(9.4 ± 2.2, n = 5), but only occurred in three mice of the
knockdown group (1.5 ± 2.1, n = 6). Similarly, metastatic lesions
in liver were found in each mouse of ACAT-1 wild-type group,
but only occurred in one mouse in the knockdown group
(Figure 6d). Ex vivo measurement of tumor volume and weight
confirmed the tumor suppressing effect of ACAT-1 knockdown
(Figures 6e and f). The slight decrease in total lipid amount
(Supplementary Figure S6B) and significant reduction of CE level
(Figure 6g) in the tumor tissues were confirmed by SRS imaging
and Raman spectral analysis, respectively. Collectively, these
data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of ACAT-1 inhibition
for pancreatic cancer treatment.
Inhibition of ACAT-1 induces ER stress and apoptosis in pancreatic
cancer
The ACAT-1 enzyme esterifies free cholesterol to its esterified
form, which can be stored in the LDs for maintenance of
cholesterol
homeostasis.
We
hypothesized
that
cholesterol
esterification provides a way to minimize the cytotoxicity of
excess free cholesterol caused by increased de novo cholesterol
synthesis and LDL uptake. As we anticipated, free cholesterol
levels gradually increased with avasimibe treatment from low to
high concentrations (Figure 7a). Increased free cholesterol was
also detected in the mouse pancreatic tumor tissues treated with
avasimibe (Supplementary Figure S7A). Increased intracellular free
cholesterol

 macrophages by inducing ER stress and subsequent apoptosis.33
To test whether avasimibe treatment was associated with ER stress
in pancreatic cancer cells, several ER stress markers were used,
including 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), activating
transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein
(CHOP).34 Immunoblotting showed that GRP78 expression level
gradually increased over time after avasimibe treatment, indicat-
ing the release of ER chaperone GRP78.34 The release of GRP78
activated subsequent unfolded protein response pathway, leading
to an increase of transcription factor ATF4 within 12 h after
treatment. ATF4 further induced expression of pro-apoptotic
factor CHOP, expression of which appeared after 12-h treatment
and increased from 12 to 48 h (Figure 7b). We further quantitated
the extent of ER stress in MIA PaCa-2 cells treated with avasimibe
from low to high concentrations, as indicated by a gradual
increase of GRP78 (Figure 7c). Increased GRP78 expression was
also observed in MIA PaCa-2 cells upon ACAT-1 knockdown
(Supplementary Figure S7B). To demonstrate the association
between ACAT-1 inhibition induced ER stress and elevated free
cholesterol level, lipodeficient serum, which removes exogenous
cholesterol, or simvastatin, which blocks cholesterol de novo
synthesis, was applied to cells treated with avasimibe. It was
shown that both lipodeficient serum and simvastatin reduced the
GRP78 level (Figure 7d), partially rescued the cells from ER stress
induced by avasimibe.

 We further demonstrate that ACAT-1 inhibition-induced ER stress
led to apoptosis of cancer cells. Using annexin V/propidium iodide
staining (Figure 7e) and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry
(Figure 7f), we found that the number of apoptotic cells largely
increased in avasimibe-treated MIA PaCa-2 cells. Increased apoptotic
cells were also observed in avasimibe-treated tumor tissues
compared with control tumor tissues, indicated by TUNEL assays
(Supplementary Figures S7C and D). Taken together, ACAT-1
inhibition induced an increase of intracellular free cholesterol, ER
stress and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells (Figure 7g).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we revealed a link between CE accumulation and
pancreatic cancer metastasis. Accumulation of CE via ACAT-1
provides a mechanism to keep high metabolic activity and avoid
toxicity from excess free cholesterol. Previously, CE has been
reported in breast cancer,23 leukemia,24 glioma25 and prostate
cancer.26 Inhibition of cholesterol esterification was shown to
suppress tumor growth or cancer cell proliferation.24–26 Here, we
demonstrate that inhibition of cholesterol esterification can be
used to treat metastatic pancreatic cancer.

 Cholesterol is an essential lipid having important roles in
membrane construction, hormone production and signaling.21
Aberrant cholesterol metabolism is known to be associated with
cardiovascular diseases and cancers.35,36 Statins, inhibitors of
HMG-CoA reductase, have been explored as potential therapies
for pancreatic cancer.37 However, statins were not associated with
a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer in clinical trials.38 One possible
reason is that HMG-CoA reductase is also required for downstream
protein prenylation, a critical process for protein activation.39 Thus,
the effect of statin is not just inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, but
also other pathways which may render toxicity to normal cells.
This non-specific toxicity is a possible reason for the limited anti-
cancer outcome of statin in clinical trials.
Our study identified cholesterol esterification as a novel target for
suppression of pancreatic cancer proliferation and metastasis.
Inhibitors of ACAT-1 are expected to have great value as cancer-
targeting therapeutics, as CE accumulation only occurs in cancer
tissues or cell lines. Our animal studies with avasimibe treatment
showed no adverse effect to the animals at a dosage of 15 mg/kg.
More importantly, modulation of cholesterol esterification suppressed
not only tumor growth but also tumor metastasis. These results are
expected to stimulate further biological studies to fully appreciate the
role of cholesterol metabolism in cancer initiation and progression. As
CE accumulation happens in several types of aggressive cancer,
blocking cholesterol esterification could be pursued as a therapeutic
strategy for other types of cancers. By combining with existing
chemotherapies, such as gemcitabine, we believe this metabolic
treatment possesses high possibilities to extend patients’ survival
time by retarding cancer progression and metastasis.
The molecular mechanism that links CE accumulation to cancer
aggressiveness needs further studies. One possible mechanism is
that cholesterol esterification keeps signaling pathways active by
maintaining a low free cholesterol environment. One of the possible
targets is the caveolin-1 signaling pathway. Caveolin-1, a regulator
of cellular cholesterol homeostasis, is considered as a marker for
pancreatic cancer progression.11 Particularly, a promoting role of
caveolin-1 in pancreatic cancer metastasis has been reported.40
Our preliminary studies showed ACAT-1 inhibition reduced the
expression level of SREBP1, caveolin-1 and phosphorylated ERK1/2
(unpublished data). The effect on caveolin-1 is probably mediated
by SREBP1, which senses the intracellular cholesterol homeostasis.41
Meanwhile, caveolin-1 may have an important role in mediating the
action of SREBP1 on MAPK pathways,42,43 which are known to have
essential roles in cancer cell metastasis.44 Therefore, it is possible
that increased free cholesterol level induced by ACAT-1 inhibition
inactivates SREBP1, leading to downregulation of caveolin-1/MAPK
pathway, which contributes to the reduced cancer aggressiveness.
Besides the caveolin-1/MAPK signaling, other possibilities include
the potential alteration of the membrane composition, such as lipid
rafts, by ACAT-1 inhibition. Lipid rafts are known to provide
platforms for multiple cellular signaling pathways.20 Thus, modula-
tion of cholesterol metabolism is likely to have more profound
effects via other signaling pathways. Future studies are needed to
fully elucidate the molecular mechanism.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human pancreatic tissue specimens
This study was approved by Institutional Review Board. Frozen specimens of
human pancreatic tissues were obtained from Indiana University Simon
Cancer Center Solid Tissue Bank. Totally, 14 pairs of matched normal and
cancerous tissues were collected. For each tissue specimen, pairs of adjacent
tissue slices were prepared to be used. One slide remained unstained
for spectroscopic imaging and the other stained with hematoxylin and eosin
for pathological examination by a pathologist. Paraffin-embedded human
pancreatic cancer tissue array was generated in IU School of Medicine.
The use of human tissue was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of
Indiana University.
Cell lines and chemicals
Immortalized human pancreatic duct epithelial cell line HPDE6 and human
pancreatic cancer cell line AsPC-1, BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). All cells
were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 supply. Cells
were grown in the following media: Keratinocyte Serum Free Medium
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 30 μg/ml BPE and 0.2 ng/
ml rEGF for HPDE6 cell; DMEM high glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with
10% FBS for PANC-1 cell; RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%
FBS for AsPC-1, BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. MIA PaCa-2 cells with stable
expression of luciferase and mCherry fluorescent protein was obtained from
In Vivo Therapeutics Core at Indiana University Simon Cancer Center (Indiana
University, IN) and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.
Chemicals including cholesteryl oleate, glyceryl trioleate and simvastatin
were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). Avasimibe used
in vitro and in vivo studies were purchased from Selleckchem.com. Human
LDL was purchased from Creative Laboratory Products (Indianapolis, IN,
USA) and conjugated with DiI by the authors. Lipoprotein-deficient Serum
was purchased from Biomedical Technologies (Ward Hill, MA, USA).
In vivo study in orthotopic mouse model
All animal experiments were conducted following protocols approved by
Purdue Animal Care and Use Committee (PACUC). Four- to 6-week-old male
NOD/scid/IL2Rγnull (NSG) mice were purchased from In Vivo Therapeutics Core
at Indiana University Simon Cancer Center (Indiana University, IN) under a
Material Transfer Agreement with Jackson Laboratories, Inc. Orthotopic mouse
model of pancreatic cancer was established following a previously described
protocol.31 MIA PaCa-2 cells with stable expression of luciferase and mCherry
were collected and suspended at a concentration of 10×106 cells/ml. A total
of 5×105 tumor cells in 50 μl media was directly injected into the pancreas of
NSG mice. After recovery from surgery, tumor growth was monitored by
bioluminescent imaging using IVIS in Bindley Bioscience Center at Purdue.
Mice were randomly divided into two groups. The group size was
estimated based on prior studies.26 For the treatment with avasimibe at
15 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection was used on a daily base, starting
1 week after tumor cell implantation. After treatment for 4 weeks, all the
mice were killed. Tumors and metastatic lesions in the abdominal cavity,
lymph nodes, liver, spleen, kidney, lung and heart were visualized with IVIS.
Tumor volume and weight were measured ex vivo. Histological examina-
tion was performed by a pathologist to tumor and organ tissue slides after
hematoxylin and eosin staining. The data analysis was validated by
a second blinded author independently.
Label-free Raman spectromicroscopy
Label-free Raman spectromicroscopy, including SRS microscopy, coherent
anti-stokes
Raman
scattering
microscopy
and
spontaneous
Raman
spectroscopy, was performed on unstained tissue slices (~15 μm) or cells
without any labeling. Details of experimental procedures and data analysis
are described in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Statistical analysis
One-way analysis of variance or Student’s t-test were used for comparisons
between groups based on an assumption of normal distribution. Results
were represented as means +/ ± s.e.m. or as specified. Kaplan–Meier
survival curves were generated using SPSS. Significant differences were
considered at *Po0.05, **Po0.01 and ***Po0.001.
