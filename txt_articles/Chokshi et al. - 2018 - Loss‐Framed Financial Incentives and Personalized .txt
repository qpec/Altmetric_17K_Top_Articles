Background-—Regular physical activity reduces the risk of cardiovascular events, but most ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients
do not obtain enough.
Methods and Results-—ACTIVE REWARD (A Clinical Trial Investigating Effects of a Randomized Evaluation of Wearable Activity
Trackers with Financial Rewards) was a 24-week home-based, remotely monitored, randomized trial with a 16-week intervention (8-
week ramp-up incentive phase and 8-week maintenance incentive phase) and an 8-week follow-up. Patients used wearable devices
to track step counts and establish a baseline. Patients in control received no other interventions. Patients in the incentive arm
received personalized step goals and daily feedback for all 24 weeks. In the ramp-up incentive phase, daily step goals increased
weekly by 15% from baseline with a maximum of 10 000 steps and then remained fixed. Each week, $14 was allocated to a virtual
account; $2 could be lost per day for not achieving step goals. The primary outcome was change in mean daily steps from baseline
to the maintenance incentive phase. Ischemic heart disease patients had a mean (SD) age of 60 (11) years and 70% were male.
Compared with control, patients in the incentive arm had a significantly greater increase in mean daily steps from baseline during
ramp-up (1388 versus 385; adjusted difference, 1061 [95% confidence interval, 386–1736]; P<0.01), maintenance (1501 versus
264; adjusted difference, 1368 [95% confidence interval, 571–2164]; P<0.001), and follow-up (1066 versus 92; adjusted
difference, 1154 [95% confidence interval, 282–2027]; P<0.01).
Conclusions-—Loss-framed financial incentives with personalized goal setting significantly increased physical activity among
ischemic heart disease patients using wearable devices during the 16-week intervention, and effects were sustained during the 8-
week follow-up.

 patients do not often achieve physical activity goals on their
own.12
Wearable devices have received significant attention for
their ability to remotely monitor health behaviors such as
physical activity.13,14 However, thus far there is limited
evidence of interventions that use these devices to effectively
sustain behavior change among high-risk patients.13,15,16 Our
previous work found that financial incentive-based approaches
that use mobile technologies can be effective in increasing
physical activity,17–19 but only if they are designed to appro-
priately leverage insights from behavioral economics—a field
that incorporates insights from psychology to design interven-
tions that address predictable barriers to behavior change.20,21
For example, we found that the framing of financial incentives
significantly impacted their effectiveness.18 A “gain-framed”
incentive that used the standard economic approach of
rewarding individuals only after physical activity goals were
achieved was not effective. However, a “loss-framed” financial
incentive that allocated money upfront to a virtual account,
which could be lost if goals were not achieved, led to a 50%
relative increase in physical activity.
In this study, our objective was to use a randomized
controlled trial to test the effectiveness of loss-framed
financial incentives with personalized goal setting to increase
physical activity among IHD patients. We tested a potentially
scalable design that recruited patients from 4 hospitals and
delivered home-based interventions remotely by using wear-
able devices and an automated technology platform.22

Study Design
ACTIVE REWARD (A Clinical Trial Investigating Effects of a
Randomized Evaluation of Wearable Activity trackers with
Financial Rewards) was a randomized controlled trial con-
ducted between March 7, 2016 and April 3, 2017 consisting
of a 16-week intervention period (composed of an 8-week
ramp-up phase followed by an 8-week maintenance phase)
and an 8-week follow-up period. The study protocol (Data S1)
was approved by the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia,
PA) Institutional Review Board, and participants provided
informed consent.
The study was conducted using Way to Health, a research
technology platform at the University of Pennsylvania used
previously for physical activity interventions.17–19,22 Patients
used the study website to create an account, provide
informed consent online, and completed baseline eligibility
surveys and the MacNew heart disease quality of life
questionnaire.23,24 Patients selected whether to receive study
communications by text message, e-mail, interactive voice
recording, or a combination of these. Eligible patients were
mailed a wrist-worn wearable device (Misfit Shine) and
authorized access for the study to capture step data. Our
previous work demonstrated that these types of devices
accurately track step counts.14
All patients received $20 for completing enrollment, $30
for completing the 24-week trial, and were allowed to keep
the wearable device after the trial concluded. Patients were
mailed a bank check at the end of each month with
accumulated earnings.
Study Sample
Recruitment occurred from February 2, 2016 to September 21,
2016 at the following 4 hospitals in southeastern Pennsylvania:
Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Penn Presbyterian
Medical Center, Chester County Hospital, and Lancaster
General Hospital. Outreach targeted patients eligible for, but
not yet enrolled in, a cardiac rehabilitation program and focused
on patients with a recent cardiac catheterization for evaluation
of coronary artery disease. Patients were contacted by
telephone or during cardiology outpatient visits. Patients were
eligible to participate if they were aged ≥18 years, had a history
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Despite the many benefits of regular physical activity, most
ischemic heart disease patients do not participate in
exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation or obtain enough
physical activity on their own.
• We evaluated a scalable approach to increase physical
activity among ischemic heart disease patients by using
insights from behavioral economics to design financial
incentives and goal setting to address predictable barriers
to behavior change and by using wearable devices to
remotely monitor behaviors.
• The combination of loss-framed financial incentives and
personalized goal setting significantly increased physical
activity levels during the 24-week trial.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Providing only wearable devices to ischemic heart disease
patients is unlikely to lead to significant changes in physical
activity.
• Combining approaches based on behavioral economic
insights with wearable devices can be used to deploy
home-based interventions that significantly change behavior
among ischemic heart disease patients.

 of
acute
coronary
syndrome
(unstable

non–
ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction, or ST-segment–
elevation myocardial infarction), or had coronary catheterization
for suspected ischemic heart disease that resulted in a
definitive diagnosis. After enrollment, we used data from the
electronic health record to check for the presence of IHD.
Patients were excluded if they were already enrolled in a formal
cardiac rehabilitation program within the past 1 year, did not
have access to a smartphone or tablet compatible with the
wearable device, were admitted to the hospital and were not
being discharged to home, or had any other reason that
participation was unsafe (eg, hemodynamic instability or New
York Heart Association Class III–IV heart failure) or infeasible
(eg, inability to provide informed consent).
Baseline Step Count
Before randomization, patients were told to spend 2 weeks
getting accustomed to their device. During this run-in period,
we estimated a baseline step count using the second week of
data—a method used in previous work.25 The first week of
data was ignored to diminish the potential upward bias of the
estimate from higher activity during initial device use. To
prevent potential mismeasurement, we ignored any daily
values less than 1000 steps because evidence indicates that
these values are unlikely to represent capture of actual
activity.26,27 If less than 4 days of data were available during
the second week (n=5), the patient was contacted to inquire
about any device issues and the run-in period was expanded
until at least 4 days of data were captured.
Randomization
Patients with a baseline step count were then electronically
randomized to a study arm using block sizes of 4, stratified by
age (<65 years versus ≥65 years). All investigators, statisti-
cians, and data analysts were blinded to arm assignments
until the study and analysis were completed.
Interventions
Patients in the control arm had their step counts passively
monitored by the wearable device, but were not informed of
their baseline step count. The wearable device was preset
with the goal of 10 000 steps per day and could be adjusted
by the patient. The wearable device displayed progress toward
that goal using a circular dial, and actual step counts were
available within the smartphone application. Patients in this
arm received no other interventions.
Patients in the incentive arm received daily feedback on
their performance for all 24 weeks. In the ramp-up incentive
phase (weeks 1–8), daily step goals increased gradually from
baseline by 15% each week with a maximum goal of 10 000
steps. After 8 weeks, step goals then remained fixed during
the maintenance incentive phase (weeks 9–16) and the
follow-up phase without incentives (weeks 17–24). During the
16-week intervention, patients were offered a loss-framed
financial incentive. Each week, patients were informed upfront
that $14 was allocated to a virtual account. Each day the
patient achieved his or her step goal, the balance remained
unchanged, but each day the step goal was not achieved, the
patient was informed that $2 had been deducted. The balance
was refreshed with $14 every week on Monday. This design
leveraged 4 important psychological principles: Individuals
tend to be more motivated by losses than gains,18,28 favor
immediate over delayed gratification,29 try to avoid the feeling
of regret,30–33 and tend to be more driven for aspirational
behavior around temporal landmarks such as the beginning of
the week (the fresh start effect).34
After the 16-week intervention period and 24-week trial,
patients in both arms were asked to complete self-reported
surveys on healthcare utilization (participation in cardiac
rehabilitation, cardiac catherization, cardiology clinic visit,
emergency room visit, and hospital admission) and percep-
tions of the overall study and wearable device.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was change in mean daily steps from
baseline to the maintenance incentive phase. Secondary
outcomes were change in mean daily steps from baseline to
the ramp-up incentive phase and follow-up phase.
Statistical Analysis
Power calculations (a priori) were based on previous work17–
19 and assumed a baseline mean step count of 6000 steps
in the control group with an SD of 2000 steps, a 15%
dropout rate, and a 2-sided a of 0.05. It was estimated that
a sample of 148 patients (74 per arm) would ensure at least
80% power to detect a 1000-step difference between the
incentive and control arms in the change in mean daily steps
from baseline to the maintenance incentive phase. However,
enrollment was closed with 105 patients because of funding
constraints on the timeline. Based on these same assump-
tions, we had at least 80% power to detect a 1200-step
difference.
All randomly assigned patients were included in the
intention-to-treat analysis. For each patient on each day of
the study (patient-day level), the number of steps achieved was
obtained as a continuous variable. Data could be missing for
any day if a patient did not use the activity tracking device or did
not upload data. One patient had very high step counts
compared to others in the study. After investigation, we learned

 that the patient frequently played the drums and there have
been reports of inaccurate step tracking from this activity.35,36
Therefore, all of this patient’s data were deemed invalid and
classified as missing. For the prespecified main analysis, we
used multiple imputation for data that were missing and step
values less than 1000. We have used this method in previous
work17–19,25 and in this study because evidence indicates that
step values less than 1000 may not represent accurate data
capture.26,27 Five imputations were conducted using the mice
package in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria), which allows for patient random effects with this data
structure.37 The following predictors of missing data were
included: study arm, week of study, calendar month, baseline
step count, age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status,
household income, body mass index, days since last cardiac
catheterization, most recent ejection fraction, and history of
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and
valvular heart disease. Results were combined using Rubin’s
standard rules.38 Secondary analyses were conducted using
collected data without multiple imputation, both with and
without step values less than 1000.
Unadjusted analyses estimated the change in mean daily
steps from baseline to each week and each phase (ramp-up,
maintenance, and follow-up) of the study. In adjusted analyses,
we used PROC GLIMMIX in SAS (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) to
fit linear mixed-effects models with a random intercept, patient
random effects, and to account for the repeated measures of
daily step counts. In the main model, we included baseline step
count and fixed effects for calendar month and study arm. To
test the robustness of our findings, we also fit a fully adjusted
model that included age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital
status, household income, body mass index, days since last
cardiac catheterization, most recent ejection fraction, and
history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
smoking, and valvular heart disease. We assumed a normal
distribution and obtained difference in steps between arms for
each phase (ramp-up, maintenance, and follow-up) using the
least squares means (LSMEANS) command. In a post-hoc
exploratory subgroup analysis, we evaluated effects in patients
with recent care for IHD by fitting the same models for only
patients who had a cardiac catheterization within the 90 days
preceding enrolling in the study.
Hypothesis tests were 2-sided using a significance level of
0.05. Analyses were conducted in SAS (version 9.4; SAS
Institute Inc) and R software (version 3.4.0; R Foundation for
Statistical Computing).
Results
In this trial, 105 patients with IHD were randomized
(Figure 1). Patients had a mean (SD) age of 60 (11) years,
70% were male, and 74% enrolled in the trial within 90 days
after a cardiac catheterization. Baseline patient characteris-
tics were well balanced across the study arms (Table 1).
Baseline mean daily steps were 6577 (SD, 3084) in control
and 7205 (SD, 3246) in the incentive arm, which was not
significantly different (P=0.32).
One hundred three patients (98%) completed the entire 24-
week study. During the maintenance period, 22.0% of
observations were missing and 1.9% of step counts were
less than 1000. In the control arm, these rates were higher
with 38.6% observations missing and 1.4% of step counts less
than 1000 (Table S1).
In the control arm, the unadjusted change in mean daily
steps from baseline began near 500 during the first 6 weeks,
but then slowly declined throughout the rest of the study
(Figure 2). In the incentive arm, the unadjusted change in
mean daily steps from baseline began above 1000 in week 1
and increased during the ramp-up incentive phase to nearly
2000. Mean change in daily steps from baseline remained
above 1250 for the maintenance period and then slightly
declined in the follow-up period ranging from 850 to 1250
(Figure 2).
In the main adjusted model compared with control,
patients in the incentive arm had a significantly greater
increase in mean daily steps from baseline during ramp-up
(1388 versus 385; adjusted difference, 1061 [95% confidence
interval [CI], 386–1736]; P<0.01), maintenance (1501 versus
264;
adjusted
difference,
1368
[95%
CI,
571–2164];
P<0.001), and follow-up (1066 versus 92; adjusted difference,
1154 [95% CI, 282–2027]; P<0.01). Results were qualitatively
similar in the fully adjusted model (Table 2) and in secondary
analyses that used collected data (Tables S2 and S3).
Seventy-eight patients (74.3%) had recent care for IHD as
indicated by a cardiac catheterization within the 90 days
preceding enrolling in the study. Subset analyses among this
group found that compared with control, patients in the
incentive arm had a significantly greater increase in mean daily
steps from baseline during ramp-up (1331 versus 276; adjusted
difference, 1131 [95% CI, 466–1797]; P<0.001), maintenance
(1445 versus 142; adjusted difference, 1509 [95% CI, 720–
2297]; P<0.001), and follow-up (1225 versus 4; adjusted
difference, 1455 [95% CI, 745–2376]; P<0.001; Table S4).
No adverse events were reported during the entire trial.
Total cost of loss-framed incentives was $5194, which
averaged $103.88 per patient. Self-reported healthcare
utilization was similar between arms (Tables S5 and S6). By
the end of the intervention, only 8 patients (3 in control and 5
in the incentive arm) reported joining a formal cardiac
rehabilitation program. Most patients reported positive per-
ceptions of their experience in the study, but more patients in
the incentive arm agreed that they would continue to use the
wearable device after the study completed (83.8% versus
5.8%; Table S7).

 Discussion
In this trial, we found that loss-framed financial incentives
with personalized goal setting and wearable devices signifi-
cantly increased physical activity among IHD patients over a
6-month period including 8 weeks of follow-up without
incentives. To our knowledge, this is 1 of the first studies to
demonstrate the successful use of financial incentives and
wearable devices to increase physical activity among this
high-risk population. Subset analyses found similar results
among the 74% of patients who had recent care for IHD as
indicated by a cardiac catheterization within the 90 days
preceding enrolling in the study. This intervention remotely
monitored patients using an automated technology platform
and wearable devices and therefore has the potential to be
scaled more broadly.
Our findings reveal several important implications for
future intervention design. First, a key element of our study
design was the use of loss aversion, a principle from
behavioral economics.13,17–19,28–34 Most previous financial
incentive-based physical activity interventions have used gain-

 behavior is achieved. However, our previous work among
overweight and obese individuals found that loss-framed
incentives were more effective than gain-framed incentives.18
Results from this trial confirm that loss-framed incentives can
significantly increase physical activity among high-risk car-
diovascular disease patients. We also found that loss-framed
incentives led to sustained effects during the 8-week follow-
up without incentives (1154 more steps). Whereas physical
activity in the incentive arm declined slightly from mainte-
nance to follow-up, activity during both periods was higher
than during the ramp-up phase (1061 more steps). It is also
important to note that physical activity levels in the control
arm declined over time, most rapidly during the follow-up
phase. Nonetheless, future studies should evaluate the
sustainability of incentive effects over longer-term periods
and could compare incentive designs that vary in magnitude,
duration, or frequency. Future studies could also evaluate
financial incentives and personalized feedback independently
to assess differential effects.
Second, our approach to goal setting was unique from
most previous financial incentive-based intervention studies.
Many physical activity interventions that use incentives are
designed with static step goals that ask individuals to
immediately achieve large step increases.16,40,42 In this trial,
we used a ramp-up phase to gradually increase physical
activity goals (15% increase per week) and personalized these
goals using the patient’s baseline step count. This approach
mirrors that of cardiac rehabilitation programs.5,7 Future
studies could directly compare immediate versus gradually
increasing step goals and evaluate different trajectories for
step-goal increases.
Third, this trial used a home-based, remotely monitored
intervention that could be scaled more broadly by leveraging
technology. IHD patients in this study all met eligibility criteria
for cardiac rehabilitation, but only 7.6% reported enrolling in a
formal program by the end of the intervention. Nationally,
cardiac rehabilitation enrollment rates are suboptimal.8,10,11
Although our intervention does not substitute for cardiac
rehabilitation, it may be an effective method to increase
physical activity in patients who are eligible but do not
participate in these programs. Future studies could build upon
this approach to further test a home-based, remotely
monitored cardiac rehabilitation program.
Our study is subject to several limitations. First, patients
were from 4 hospitals in southeastern Pennsylvania and
needed access to a smartphone or tablet, which may limit
generalizability. Second, we evaluated physical activity using
step counts and did not have data on other measures of

 physical activity, device wear time, or other health outcomes.
However, step counts are most commonly displayed by
wearable devices and have been successfully used in
interventions with small improvements in clinical outcomes
across different populations.43 Future studies could evaluate
both changes in step counts and other clinical outcomes over
longer periods. Third, the control arm had slightly higher
missing data rates than the incentive arm. However, our
imputation and regression models both used patient random
effects to adjust for differential variation across patients and
arms. We also found similar results when using imputed and
nonimputed data. Fourth, whereas effects were sustained
during follow-up, daily feedback was continued and physical
activity did decline slightly. Further evaluations are needed to
determine longer-term sustainability. Fifth, the control arm did
not receive daily feedback or personalized goal setting, and so
we were unable to isolate the effects of the financial incentive
alone. Sixth, in this study, loss-framed incentives were
compared with control and not with gain-framed incentives.
Future studies could compare different ways to frame
incentives in this study population to increase physical
activity.
Conclusions
In this home-based, remotely monitored trial of IHD patients
using wearable devices, loss-framed financial incentives with
personalized goal setting significantly increased physical
activity during the 16-week intervention, and effects were
sustained during the 8-week follow-up. Our findings demon-
strate that digital health interventions that leverage insights
from behavioral economics offer a promising approach to
change health behaviors among patients with cardiovascular
disease.

Study Protocol 
 
Summary of Changes to the Protocol 
The original study protocol was approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) on January 7, 2016.  Study recruitment began on February 2, 2016. This protocol 
had a target population of patients with ischemic heart disease that were discharged from the 
hospital within the past 30 days. Because of our funding timeline and slower than expected 
patient recruitment we submitted a modification to the IRB on May 19, 2016 to broaden the 
target population to allow enrollment of any patient with a history of ischemic heart disease.  
This was approved by the IRB on June 2, 2016.  There were no changes to the statistical analysis 
plan.

1. Abstract 
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States.  Among patients 
that survive an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been 
demonstrated to effectively reduce risk of re-infarction, cardiac mortality, and all-cause 
mortality.  However, despite CR being a Class I (standard of care) recommendation in multiple 
American Heart Association AMI guidelines, more than 80% of eligible patients do not receive 
appropriate CR and much of this is due to challenges in access to these programs.  Recent 
innovations in technology allow us to passively monitor an individual’s physical activity using 
wearable devices.  Incentives designed using insights from behavioral economics have been 
demonstrated to motivate device engagement and behavior change.  A remotely-monitored CR 
program could improve access for many individuals and potentially be more cost-effective 
because it is less resource- and personnel-intensive.  The objective of this study is to use a 
randomized, controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a home-based, remotely monitored 
program using wearable devices and financial incentives to increase physical activity.  
Participants will go through four phases: baseline period (weeks 1-2), ramp-up period (weeks 3-
10), maintenance period (weeks 11-18), and follow-up period (weeks 19-26).   
2. Overall objectives 
The objective of this study is to use a randomized, controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a 
home-based, remotely monitored program using wearable devices and financial incentives to 
increase physical activity   
3. Aims 
 
3.1 Primary outcome 
The primary outcome variable is the change in mean daily step count from the baseline period 
(weeks 1-2) to the maintenance period (weeks 11-18). 
 
3.2 Secondary outcome 
Secondary outcomes include change in mean daily steps from baseline to follow-up period, 
change in time slept from baseline to maintenance period, change in six minute walk test from 
baseline to end of maintenance period (optional for participants), and healthcare utilization 
during the ramp-up and maintenance period as measured by number of hospitalizations and 
emergency department visits.   
4. Background 
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States (1).  Among patients 
that survive an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been 
demonstrated to effectively reduce risk of re-infarction, cardiac mortality, and all-cause mortality 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 2, 2019
  
 
(2).  Patients completing CR have also been found to have improvements in blood pressure 
control, lipid levels, and a reduction in smoking (3). 
Despite this, more than 80% of eligible patients do not receive cardiac rehabilitation (4).  Access 
and affordability are some of the primary factors associated with the low compliance with CR 
(5).  Since CR centers are often located in more urban areas, patients that live in more rural 
locations or without transportation may have difficulty reaching these centers. 
Recent innovations in technology allow us to passively monitor an individual’s physical activity 
using wearable devices (6).  These devices have been demonstrated to be accurate for tracking 
step counts (7) and could be utilized to deploy a home-based intervention.  Recently, the concept 
of a remotely-monitored, internet-based CR program has been shown to be safe and superior to 
usual care (in terms of reducing CVD risk) in a small Canadian pilot study (8).  A remotely-
monitored CR program would provide access for the many individuals that cannot reach a CR 
center and potentially, in the future, could be more cost-effective because it is less resource- and 
personnel-intensive.  The optimal range of steps for secondary prevention of AMI is in the range 
of 6500-8500 steps/day (9).

5. Study design 
 
5.1 Design 
We will conduct a two-arm randomized, controlled trial comparing a control group that uses a 
wearable devices to track physical activity and sleep data to an intervention group that uses the 
same wearable devices and receives a financial incentive to adhere to a step goal program.  
Patients will be randomized to one of the two arms using a block size of four.  To account for 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 2, 2019
  
 
possible differences in reimbursement for CR among patients with and without Medicare, we 
will stratify the randomization by age (less than 65 years vs. 65 years and older).  Since referral 
to a standard health system CR program is recommended for all patients after an acute 
myocardial infarction, we will not attempt to modify current referral and adherence patterns to 
these programs.  However, data suggest that more than 80% will not actually obtain this type of 
cardiac rehabilitation.  During the study, we will ask all patients whether or not they participated 
in a standard cardiac rehabilitation program.   
All participants will receive $20 for enrolling and $30 for completing the 26 week study.  All 
participants will be given the option to have an in-person visit with the study coordinator at the 
beginning and after the maintenance period to conduct the six minute walk test.  If a participant 
chooses to participate they will receive $30 for each visit. 
Participants in all arms will be informed of the CDC/federal recommendation guidelines for 
physical activity and receive additional interventions as follows: 
Arm 1. Control: use a wearable device to track physical activity and sleep data.  Receive 
reminders to use their device and sync their data.  
Arm 2. Financial incentive-based program: Participants will be given a wearable device to 
monitor daily step counts and sleep patterns with automated feedback on physical activity goal 
attainment via text message, automated interactive voice call or email (based on participant 
communication choice).  Based on recommendations for the optimal step count for secondary 
prevention of AMI, we will establish a baseline step count for each participant (weeks 1-2) and 
then recommend a 15 percentage point increase in daily step goal each week during the 8-week 
ramp-up phase (weeks 3-10) with a maximum goal of 10,000 steps.  After the ramp-up phase, 
participants will be asked to maintain that daily step goal for the maintenance period (weeks 11-
18).  After 18 weeks, financial incentives will be stopped and the participants will be followed 
for an additional 8 weeks with the same step goal as the maintenance period (weeks 19-26).  
Participants will be given daily feedback on whether or not they achieved their daily step goal on 
the prior day, for the entire intervention and follow-up period.  Participants will be told at the 
beginning of each week during the ramp-up and maintenance phases that $14 has been placed in 
a virtual account for them.  Each day during the week that the participant does not meet their 
daily step goal, $2 will be removed from their account.  Accrued winnings will be sent to the 
participant by check via US mail at the end of each month.  There will be no financial incentive 
during the 2-week baseline period or the 8-week follow-up period.   
 
5.2 Study duration 
This is an 26-week study with rolling enrollment beginning in January 2016. 
 
5.3 Target population 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 2, 2019
  
 
Adults age ≥ 18 years discharged from one of the University of Pennsylvania Health System 
hospitals to home after admission for acute coronary syndrome or after undergoing coronary 
catheterization for suspected coronary artery disease. 
 
5.4 Accrual 
The study population will be drawn from adults admitted and discharged from the inpatient 
cardiology services at one of the University of Pennsylvania Health System hospitals.  We will 
aim to enroll 150 participants.  We estimate that a sample size of at least 148 participants (74 per 
arm) will provide 80% power to detect a difference of 1000 steps in the change in mean daily 
step count from baseline to maintenance phase between intervention and control, using a 2-sided 
α of 0.05, assuming a baseline mean step count of 6000 steps in the control group with a standard 
deviation of 2000 steps, and accounting for a 15% dropout rate.   
 
5.5 Key inclusion criteria 
1) Age ≥18 years; 2) ability to read and provide informed consent to participate in the study; 3) 
admission to the cardiology service one of the University of Pennsylvania Health System 
hospitals and diagnosed with a) acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina, non-ST elevation 
myocardial infarction or ST elevation myocardial infarction); or b) patients having undergone 
coronary catheterization for suspected coronary artery disease. 
 
5.6 Key exclusion criteria 
1) Inability to provide informed consent; 2) does not have daily access to a smartphone 
compatible with the wearable device; 3) unable or unwilling to participate in a 26-week physical 
activity program 4) already enrolled in an exercise cardiac rehabilitation program prior to 
hospital admission; 5) hemodynamic instability or NYHA III-IV heart failure; 6) any other

6. Subject recruitment 
Potentially eligible participants will be identified from the cardiology services at one of the 
University of Pennsylvania Health System hospitals by the study coordinator.  Participants will 
be recruited either in person while in the hospital or by phone after discharge   Interested 
participants will be directed to the online Way to Health study website to review and provide 
informed consent, complete eligibility and baseline questionnaires, and if eligible enroll in the 
study.   
7. Subject compensation 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 2, 2019
  
 
All participants will receive $20 for enrolling and $30 for completing the 26-week study.  
Participants that choose to attend the optional in-person visit for the six minute walk test will 
receive $30 for each visit. 
Participants randomized to Arm 2 (financial incentive program) will be told at the beginning of 
each week during the ramp-up and maintenance phases that $14 has been placed in a virtual 
account.  Each day that the participant does not meet their daily step goal, $2 will be removed 
from their account.  Accrued winnings will be sent to the participant by check via US mail at the 
end of each month.  There will be no financial incentive during the 2-week baseline period or 8-
week follow-up period.   
8. Study procedures 
 
8.1 Consent 
Upon recruitment, individuals who are interested in learning more about the study will be 
directed to the Way to Health web portal. Upon reaching the portal, potential participants will be 
asked to create an account and will then be informed of the details of the study, including its 
objectives, duration, requirements, and financial payments.  If participants are still interested in 
participating, the Way to Health portal will take them through an automated online informed 
consent. The consent document will be divided into sections and potential participants will have 
to click a button to advance through each section. This is to help ensure that participants read the 
consent form thoroughly by breaking down the form into manageable blocks of text. Each 
section will have a button allowing the user to contact a researcher via email or by telephone if 
they have questions about the consent form. Successive screens will explain the voluntary nature 
of the study, the risks and benefits of participation, alternatives to participation, and that 
participants can withdraw from the study at any time. On the final consent screen, potential 
participants who click a clearly delineated button stating that they agree to participate in the 
study will be considered to have consented to enroll. After consenting, participants will complete 
an online questionnaire to determine their eligibility. Eligible participants will be randomized to 
one of the study arms and led through an automated description of the details specific to that 
arm. Participants will be provided with details regarding how to contact the research team via 
email or phone at any time if they subsequently wish to withdraw from the study. This contact 
information will remain easily accessible via the participants’ individual Way to Health web 
portal dashboards throughout the study. 
 
8.2 Procedures 
Potentially eligible participants will be identified from one of the University of Pennsylvania 
Health System hospitals by the study coordinator.  Participants will be recruited either in person 
while in the hospital or by phone after discharge   Interested participants will be directed to the 
online Way to Health study website to review and provide informed consent, complete eligibility 
and baseline questionnaires, and if eligible enroll in the study.

All participants will receive a wearable device from the study coordinator and be asked to 
authorize the device to electronically transmit de-identified data to the study database.  
Participants in this arm will be told to wear the step tracking device for the next two weeks and 
get used to the device.  They will be provided with the study coordinator’s email and phone 
number to contact with any questions.  Participants will be told that they need to sync their 
wearable device with their smartphone in order for data to be transmitted to the study team.  
Participants will receive regular reminders during the baseline period to wear and sync their 
devices.  If the study coordinator notices that a participant is not transmitting data during this 
two-week baseline period, they will contact the participant to determine the reason and offer 
assistance on how to use the device.  After the two-week baseline period is completed, a baseline 
step count will be calculated using the second week of step count data and ignoring days on 
which the individual had less than 1,000 steps.  We use the second week of data rather than both 
weeks in case the individual has more activity during the first week simply because they got a 
new device.  We ignore days on which less than 1,000 steps are recorded because prior research 
suggests that this is unlikely to be appropriate capture of physical activity (Rowe et al. Pediatric 
Exercise Science. 2004;16:1-12. Kang et al. Measurement in Physical Education and Exercise 
Science. 2004;9(4):233-250.) and including these values may inappropriately downward bias the 
baseline step level for that individual.  If at least four days of data are not available to calculate th 
baseline step count, then the period will extend until at least four days of data are available. 
Once a baseline step level has been determined, participants will be sent a message to log into 
Way to Health to receive further instructions on their arm design as described previously in 
section 5.1: design. 
9. Analysis plan 
To compare sample characteristics between arms we will use t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests 
(F-tests or Kruskal-Wallis test) for continuous variables and Pearson chi square tests or Fisher’s 
exact tests for categorical variables. In our primary analyses, we will compare the change in 
mean daily step count from baseline to maintenance period.  In secondary analyses, we will 
compare the change from baseline period to ramp-up and follow-up periods.  We will also 
compare change in sleep patterns and for those that participants change in distance in the six 
minute walk test.  All hypothesis tests will be two-sided using a two-sided alpha of 0.05 as our 
threshold for statistical significance. We will use Stata and/or SAS to analyze the data.  We will 
use multiple imputation for missing data.

Assistants to follow study protocols. 
11. Human research protection 
 
11.1 Data confidentiality 
Paper-based records will be kept in a secure location and only be accessible to personnel 
involved in the study. Computer-based files will only be made available to personnel involved in 
the study through the use of access privileges and passwords. Wherever feasible, identifiers will 
be removed from study-related information. Precautions are in place to ensure the data are secure 
by using passwords and encryption, because the research involves web-based surveys. 
 
11.2 Subject confidentiality 
Research material will be obtained from participant surveys, from the wearable devices, and 
from the 6-minute walk test.  All participants will provide informed consent for access to these 
materials. The data to be collected include demographic data (e.g., age, sex, self-identified race), 
outcome data, and daily activity data collected by the wearable device.  Research material that is 
obtained will be used for research purposes only. The same procedure used for the analysis of 
automated data sources to ensure protection of patient information will be used for the survey 
data, in that patient identifiers will be used only for linkage purposes or to contact patients. The 
study identification number, and not other identifying information, will be used on all data 
collection instruments. All study staff will be reminded to appreciate the confidential nature of 
the data collected and contained in these databases. The Penn Medicine Academic Computing 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 2, 2019
  
 
Services (PMACS) will be the hub for the hardware and database infrastructure that will support 
the project and is where the Way to Health web portal is based. The PMACS is a joint effort of 
the University of Pennsylvania's Abramson Cancer Center, the Cardiovascular Institute, the 
Department of Pathology, and the Leonard Davis Institute. The PMACS provides a secure 
computing environment for a large volume of highly sensitive data, including clinical, genetic, 
socioeconomic, and financial information. Among the IT projects currently managed by PMACS 
are: (1) the capture and organization of complex, longitudinal clinical data via web and clinical 
applications portals from cancer patients enrolled in clinical trials; (2) the integration of genetic 
array databases and clinical data obtained from patients with cardiovascular disease; (3) 
computational biology and cytometry database management and analyses; (4) economic and 
health policy research using Medicare claims from over 40 million Medicare beneficiaries. 
PMACS requires all users of data or applications on PMACS servers to complete a PMACS-
hosted cybersecurity awareness course annually, which stresses federal data security policies 
under data use agreements with the university. The curriculum includes Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) training and covers secure data transfer, passwords, 
computer security habits and knowledge of what constitutes misuse or inappropriate use of the 
server. We will implement multiple, redundant protective measures to guarantee the privacy and 
security of the participant data. All investigators and research staff with direct access to the 
identifiable data will be required to undergo annual responsible conduct of research, 
cybersecurity, and HIPAA certification in accordance with University of Pennsylvania 
regulations. All data for this project will be stored on the secure/firewalled servers of the 
PMACS Data Center, in data files that will be protected by multiple password layers. These data 
servers are maintained in a guarded facility behind several locked doors, with very limited 
physical access rights. They are also cyber-protected by extensive firewalls and multiple layers 
of communication encryption. Electronic access rights are carefully controlled by University of 
Pennsylvania system managers. We will use highly secure methods of data encryption for all 
transactions involving participants’ financial information using a level of security comparable to 
what is used in commercial financial transactions. We believe this multi-layer system of data 
security, identical to the system protecting the University of Pennsylvania Health Systems 
medical records, greatly minimizes the risk of loss of privacy. In addition, risk of loss of 
confidentiality will be minimized by storing completed paper copies of the surveys and signed 
informed consent forms in locked file cabinets in locked offices accessible only to trained study 
staff. Each subject will be assigned a unique identifier without identifying information, and data 
will be entered into an electronic database using only the unique identifier. Only trained study 
staff will have access to the code that links the unique identifier to the subject’s identity. 
Electronic data will be stored on secure, password-protected firewalled servers at the University 
of Pennsylvania. 
 
11.3 Subject privacy 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 2, 2019
  
 
Interested participants will be directed to the Way to Health portal where they will be asked to 
enter data related to eligibility and their demographic characteristics. Enrollment will include a 
description of the voluntary nature of participation, the study procedures, risks and potential 
benefits in detail. The enrollment procedure will provide the opportunity for potential 
participants to ask questions and review the consent form information with family and friends 
prior to making a decision to participate. Participants will be told that they do not have to answer 
any questions if they do not wish and can drop out of the study at any time, without affecting 
their medical care or the cost of their care. They will be told that they may or may not benefit 
directly from the study and that all information will be kept strictly confidential, except as 
required by law. Subjects will be given a copy of the consent document. All efforts will be made 
by study staff to ensure subject privacy. 
 
11.4 Data disclosure 
The following entities, besides the members of the research team, may receive protected health 
information (PHI) for this research study: -Wells Fargo, the company which processes study-
related payments. Patient addresses and account balances will be stored on their secure 
computers. –P’unk Ave., LLC, a software development company designing the Way to Health 
website. P’unk Ave. will not store any of the patients' PHI, but they will have access to de-
identified patient information, for the purposes of website administration and development. - 
Misfit Wearables, the company that designs and manufactures the wearable devices used in the 
study to track participant physical activity. -Twilio, Inc., the company which processes some 
study-related messages. Twilio will store patients' phone numbers on their secure computers. -
Qualtrics, Inc., the company which processes most study-related surveys. Qualtrics will house 
de-identified answers to these surveys on their secure servers. -The Office of Human Research 
Protections at the University of Pennsylvania -Federal and state agencies (for example, the 
Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health, and/or the Office 
for Human Research Protections), or other domestic or foreign government bodies if required by 
law and/or necessary for oversight purposes. 
 
11.5 Data safety and monitoring 
At the time of discharge from the hospital, all patients are given anticipatory guidance on when 
to seek medical attention.  In addition, participants will be asked to report to the study team any 
episodes of chest pain, shortness of breath or other changes during periods of exercise.  They will 
be reminded of this at the end of each week of the study.  They can either call the study team or 
send an email.  The research coordinator will call the participant to collect information regarding 
the issue and then the PI will review and determine whether it is ok to proceed, further 
investigation is needed, or the participant should stop the study.  If the participant happens to 
also enroll in a standard cardiac rehabilitation program and is told that they should be pursuing a 
different step count than in the study, they will be asked to report that to the study team and their 
study count goal may be adjusted.

11.6 Risk/benefit  
 
 
11.6.1 Potential study risks 
To minimize the chance for serious and unexpected adverse events, study participants will be 
screened through exclusion criteria for any health conditions that may be exacerbated by 
participating in a physical activity study. The home-based rehab program tries to motivate a 
gradual step count increase that should pose little health risk to participants.  Participants are 
given guidance on when to seek medical attention and a reporting protocol is in place to capture 
any changes in symptoms with physical activity. Another potential risk of this study is a breach 
of participant confidentiality. We will minimize this risk by linking individual identifying 
information with participant ID numbers only in one single secure file that will only be accessed 
by the study team in the case of an adverse medical event, participant dropout, or if otherwise 
deemed necessary by the Principal Investigator. All other identifying information will be 
discarded after initial contact with the Study Coordinator. Due to the financial incentives in this 
study, we will be collecting social security numbers so that we can complete W-9 forms for 
participants. Social security numbers only will be used to generate W-9 forms and will be deleted 
once they are no longer needed. We will also collect home addresses to mail incentive payments. 
This will be done through a University of Pennsylvania approved partnership with Wells Fargo. 
Accidental disclosure of social security numbers could lead to identity theft. We will use 
commercial-grade encryption to protect social security information in transit. Names and 
addresses will be stored in encrypted databases. These data will be viewable only by the 
respective participants and the study coordinator. All other members of the research team will be 
able to view only participant ID numbers. There will be no functionality in the web application 
to export a dataset with identifiable information. Even the study arms will be identified by code 
letters until both the statistician and PI agree that analysis is complete. 
 
 
11.6.2 Potential study benefits 
Through participation in this study, each participant will have the potential to increase their 
physical activity, which could improve their health and reduce their risk for future cardiovascular 
disease or other conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. If this approach is 
effective, it could have tremendous benefits for society if adopted on a wide scale to help 
individuals increase physical activity after discharge from the cardiology service. It is expected 
that other people will gain knowledge from this study and that participation could help 
understand how to effectively motivate people to become more physically active. Participants 
may also receive no benefit from their participation in the study. 
 
 
11.6.3 Risk/benefit assessment 
Anticipated risks of this study should be minimal and the risk/benefit ratio is very favorable. To 
minimize the chance for serious and unexpected adverse events, study participants will be 
screened through exclusion criteria for any health conditions that may be exacerbated by

participating in a physical activity study. Participants that increase physical activity may improve 
their health and reduce their risk for future cardiovascular disease or other conditions such as 
diabetes, hypertension, and osteoarthritis.

1. Abstract 
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States.  Among patients 
that survive an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been 
demonstrated to effectively reduce risk of re-infarction, cardiac mortality, and all-cause 
mortality.  However, despite CR being a Class I (standard of care) recommendation in multiple 
American Heart Association AMI guidelines, more than 80% of eligible patients do not receive 
appropriate CR and much of this is due to challenges in access to these programs.  Recent 
innovations in technology allow us to passively monitor an individual’s physical activity using 
wearable devices.  Incentives designed using insights from behavioral economics have been 
demonstrated to motivate device engagement and behavior change.  A remotely-monitored CR 
program could improve access for many individuals and potentially be more cost-effective 
because it is less resource- and personnel-intensive.  The objective of this study is to use a 
randomized, controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a home-based, remotely monitored 
program using wearable devices and financial incentives to increase physical activity.  
Participants will go through four phases: baseline period (weeks 1-2), ramp-up period (weeks 3-
10), maintenance period (weeks 11-18), and follow-up period (weeks 19-26).   
2. Overall objectives 
The objective of this study is to use a randomized, controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a 
home-based, remotely monitored program using wearable devices and financial incentives to 
increase physical activity   
3. Aims 
 
3.1 Primary outcome 
The primary outcome variable is the change in mean daily step count from the baseline period 
(weeks 1-2) to the maintenance period (weeks 11-18). 
 
3.2 Secondary outcome 
Secondary outcomes include change in mean daily steps from baseline to follow-up period, 
change in time slept from baseline to maintenance period, change in six minute walk test from 
baseline to end of maintenance period (optional for participants), and healthcare utilization 
during the ramp-up and maintenance period as measured by number of hospitalizations and 
emergency department visits.   
4. Background 
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States (1).  Among patients 
that survive an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been 
demonstrated to effectively reduce risk of re-infarction, cardiac mortality, and all-cause mortality 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 2, 2019
  
 
(2).  Patients completing CR have also been found to have improvements in blood pressure 
control, lipid levels, and a reduction in smoking (3). 
Despite this, more than 80% of eligible patients do not receive cardiac rehabilitation (4).  Access 
and affordability are some of the primary factors associated with the low compliance with CR 
(5).  Since CR centers are often located in more urban areas, patients that live in more rural 
locations or without transportation may have difficulty reaching these centers. 
Recent innovations in technology allow us to passively monitor an individual’s physical activity 
using wearable devices (6).  These devices have been demonstrated to be accurate for tracking 
step counts (7) and could be utilized to deploy a home-based intervention.  Recently, the concept 
of a remotely-monitored, internet-based CR program has been shown to be safe and superior to 
usual care (in terms of reducing CVD risk) in a small Canadian pilot study (8).  A remotely-
monitored CR program would provide access for the many individuals that cannot reach a CR 
center and potentially, in the future, could be more cost-effective because it is less resource- and 
personnel-intensive.  The optimal range of steps for secondary prevention of AMI is in the range 
of 6500-8500 steps/day (9).

5. Study design 
 
5.1 Design 
We will conduct a two-arm randomized, controlled trial comparing a control group that uses a 
wearable devices to track physical activity and sleep data to an intervention group that uses the 
same wearable devices and receives a financial incentive to adhere to a step goal program.  
Patients will be randomized to one of the two arms using a block size of four.  To account for 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 2, 2019
  
 
possible differences in reimbursement for CR among patients with and without Medicare, we 
will stratify the randomization by age (less than 65 years vs. 65 years and older).  Since referral 
to a standard health system CR program is recommended for all patients after an acute 
myocardial infarction, we will not attempt to modify current referral and adherence patterns to 
these programs.  However, data suggest that more than 80% will not actually obtain this type of 
cardiac rehabilitation.  During the study, we will ask all patients whether or not they participated 
in a standard cardiac rehabilitation program.   
All participants will receive $20 for enrolling and $30 for completing the 26 week study.  All 
participants will be given the option to have an in-person visit with the study coordinator at the 
beginning and after the maintenance period to conduct the six minute walk test.  If a participant 
chooses to participate they will receive $30 for each visit. 
Participants in all arms will be informed of the CDC/federal recommendation guidelines for 
physical activity and receive additional interventions as follows: 
Arm 1. Control: use a wearable device to track physical activity and sleep data.  Receive 
reminders to use their device and sync their data.  
Arm 2. Financial incentive-based program: Participants will be given a wearable device to 
monitor daily step counts and sleep patterns with automated feedback on physical activity goal 
attainment via text message, automated interactive voice call or email (based on participant 
communication choice).  Based on recommendations for the optimal step count for secondary 
prevention of AMI, we will establish a baseline step count for each participant (weeks 1-2) and 
then recommend a 15 percentage point increase in daily step goal each week during the 8-week 
ramp-up phase (weeks 3-10) with a maximum goal of 10,000 steps.  After the ramp-up phase, 
participants will be asked to maintain that daily step goal for the maintenance period (weeks 11-
18).  After 18 weeks, financial incentives will be stopped and the participants will be followed 
for an additional 8 weeks with the same step goal as the maintenance period (weeks 19-26).  
Participants will be given daily feedback on whether or not they achieved their daily step goal on 
the prior day, for the entire intervention and follow-up period.  Participants will be told at the 
beginning of each week during the ramp-up and maintenance phases that $14 has been placed in 
a virtual account for them.  Each day during the week that the participant does not meet their 
daily step goal, $2 will be removed from their account.  Accrued winnings will be sent to the 
participant by check via US mail at the end of each month.  There will be no financial incentive 
during the 2-week baseline period or the 8-week follow-up period.   
 
5.2 Study duration 
This is an 26-week study with rolling enrollment beginning in January 2016. 
 
5.3 Target population 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 2, 2019
  
 
Adults age ≥ 18 years with a history of acute coronary syndrome or history of undergoing 
coronary catheterization for suspected coronary artery disease. 
 
5.4 Accrual 
The study population will be drawn from adults at one of the University of Pennsylvania Health 
System hospitals or clinics.  We will aim to enroll 150 participants.  We estimate that a sample 
size of at least 148 participants (74 per arm) will provide 80% power to detect a difference of 
1000 steps in the change in mean daily step count from baseline to maintenance phase between 
intervention and control, using a 2-sided α of 0.05, assuming a baseline mean step count of 6000 
steps in the control group with a standard deviation of 2000 steps, and accounting for a 15% 
dropout rate.   
 
5.5 Key inclusion criteria 
1) Age ≥18 years; 2) ability to read and provide informed consent to participate in the study; 3) 
history of a) acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction 
or ST elevation myocardial infarction); or b) patients having undergone coronary catheterization 
for suspected coronary artery disease. 
 
5.6 Key exclusion criteria 
1) Inability to provide informed consent; 2) does not have daily access to a smartphone 
compatible with the wearable device and not willing to use a device that we can provide them; 3) 
unable or unwilling to participate in a 26-week physical activity program 4) already enrolled in 
an exercise cardiac rehabilitation program prior to hospital admission; 5) hemodynamic 
instability or NYHA III-IV heart failure; 6) any other medical conditions that would prohibit 
participation in an 26-week physical activity program; 7) if admitted and not being discharged to 
home. 
6. Subject recruitment 
Potentially eligible participants will be identified from data requests to Penn Data Store and 
EPIC, and from the cardiology services or clinics at one of the University of Pennsylvania Health 
System hospitals by the study coordinator.  Participants will be recruited either in person or by 
phone.  Interested participants will be directed to the online Way to Health study website to 
review and provide informed consent, complete eligibility and baseline questionnaires, and if 
eligible enroll in the study.   
7. Subject compensation 
All participants will receive $20 for enrolling and $30 for completing the 26-week study.  
Participants that choose to attend the optional in-person visit for the six minute walk test will 
receive $30 for each visit.

Participants randomized to Arm 2 (financial incentive program) will be told at the beginning of 
each week during the ramp-up and maintenance phases that $14 has been placed in a virtual 
account.  Each day that the participant does not meet their daily step goal, $2 will be removed 
from their account.  Accrued winnings will be sent to the participant by check via US mail at the 
end of each month.  There will be no financial incentive during the 2-week baseline period or 8-
week follow-up period.   
8. Study procedures 
 
8.1 Consent 
Upon recruitment, individuals who are interested in learning more about the study will be 
directed to the Way to Health web portal. Upon reaching the portal, potential participants will be 
asked to create an account and will then be informed of the details of the study, including its 
objectives, duration, requirements, and financial payments.  If participants are still interested in 
participating, the Way to Health portal will take them through an automated online informed 
consent. The consent document will be divided into sections and potential participants will have 
to click a button to advance through each section. This is to help ensure that participants read the 
consent form thoroughly by breaking down the form into manageable blocks of text. Each 
section will have a button allowing the user to contact a researcher via email or by telephone if 
they have questions about the consent form. Successive screens will explain the voluntary nature 
of the study, the risks and benefits of participation, alternatives to participation, and that 
participants can withdraw from the study at any time. On the final consent screen, potential 
participants who click a clearly delineated button stating that they agree to participate in the 
study will be considered to have consented to enroll. After consenting, participants will complete 
an online questionnaire to determine their eligibility. Eligible participants will be randomized to 
one of the study arms and led through an automated description of the details specific to that 
arm. Participants will be provided with details regarding how to contact the research team via 
email or phone at any time if they subsequently wish to withdraw from the study. This contact 
information will remain easily accessible via the participants’ individual Way to Health web 
portal dashboards throughout the study. 
 
8.2 Procedures 
Potentially eligible participants will be identified from data requests to Penn Data Store and 
EPIC, and from the cardiology services or clinics at one of the University of Pennsylvania Health 
System hospitals by the study coordinator.  Participants will be recruited either in person or by 
phone.  Interested participants will be directed to the online Way to Health study website to 
review and provide informed consent, complete eligibility and baseline questionnaires, and if 
eligible enroll in the study.   
All participants will receive a wearable device from the study coordinator and be asked to 
authorize the device to electronically transmit de-identified data to the study database.  
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 2, 2019
  
 
Participants in this arm will be told to wear the step tracking device for the next two weeks and 
get used to the device.  They will be provided with the study coordinator’s email and phone 
number to contact with any questions.  Participants will be told that they need to sync their 
wearable device with their smartphone in order for data to be transmitted to the study team.  
Participants will receive regular reminders during the baseline period to wear and sync their 
devices.  If the study coordinator notices that a participant is not transmitting data during this 
two-week baseline period, they will contact the participant to determine the reason and offer 
assistance on how to use the device.  After the two-week baseline period is completed, a baseline 
step count will be calculated using the second week of step count data and ignoring days on 
which the individual had less than 1,000 steps.  We use the second week of data rather than both 
weeks in case the individual has more activity during the first week simply because they got a 
new device.  We ignore days on which less than 1,000 steps are recorded because prior research 
suggests that this is unlikely to be appropriate capture of physical activity (Rowe et al. Pediatric 
Exercise Science. 2004;16:1-12. Kang et al. Measurement in Physical Education and Exercise 
Science. 2004;9(4):233-250.) and including these values may inappropriately downward bias the 
baseline step level for that individual.  If at least four days of data are not available to calculate th 
baseline step count, then the period will extend until at least four days of data are available. 
Once a baseline step level has been determined, participants will be sent a message to log into 
Way to Health to receive further instructions on their arm design as described previously in 
section 5.1: design. 
9. Analysis plan 
To compare sample characteristics between arms we will use t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests 
(F-tests or Kruskal-Wallis test) for continuous variables and Pearson chi square tests or Fisher’s 
exact tests for categorical variables. In our primary analyses, we will compare the change in 
mean daily step count from baseline to maintenance period.  In secondary analyses, we will 
compare the change from baseline period to ramp-up and follow-up periods.  We will also 
compare change in sleep patterns and for those that participants change in distance in the six 
minute walk test.  All hypothesis tests will be two-sided using a two-sided alpha of 0.05 as our 
threshold for statistical significance. We will use Stata and/or SAS to analyze the data.  We will 
use multiple imputation for missing data.

11. Human research protection 
 
11.1 Data confidentiality 
Paper-based records will be kept in a secure location and only be accessible to personnel 
involved in the study. Computer-based files will only be made available to personnel involved in 
the study through the use of access privileges and passwords. Wherever feasible, identifiers will 
be removed from study-related information. Precautions are in place to ensure the data are secure 
by using passwords and encryption, because the research involves web-based surveys. 
 
11.2 Subject confidentiality 
Research material will be obtained from participant surveys, from the wearable devices, and 
from the 6-minute walk test.  All participants will provide informed consent for access to these 
materials. The data to be collected include demographic data (e.g., age, sex, self-identified race), 
outcome data, and daily activity data collected by the wearable device.  Research material that is 
obtained will be used for research purposes only. The same procedure used for the analysis of 
automated data sources to ensure protection of patient information will be used for the survey 
data, in that patient identifiers will be used only for linkage purposes or to contact patients. The 
study identification number, and not other identifying information, will be used on all data 
collection instruments. All study staff will be reminded to appreciate the confidential nature of 
the data collected and contained in these databases. The Penn Medicine Academic Computing 
Services (PMACS) will be the hub for the hardware and database infrastructure that will support 
the project and is where the Way to Health web portal is based. The PMACS is a joint effort of 
the University of Pennsylvania's Abramson Cancer Center, the Cardiovascular Institute, the 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 2, 2019
  
 
Department of Pathology, and the Leonard Davis Institute. The PMACS provides a secure 
computing environment for a large volume of highly sensitive data, including clinical, genetic, 
socioeconomic, and financial information. Among the IT projects currently managed by PMACS 
are: (1) the capture and organization of complex, longitudinal clinical data via web and clinical 
applications portals from cancer patients enrolled in clinical trials; (2) the integration of genetic 
array databases and clinical data obtained from patients with cardiovascular disease; (3) 
computational biology and cytometry database management and analyses; (4) economic and 
health policy research using Medicare claims from over 40 million Medicare beneficiaries. 
PMACS requires all users of data or applications on PMACS servers to complete a PMACS-
hosted cybersecurity awareness course annually, which stresses federal data security policies 
under data use agreements with the university. The curriculum includes Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) training and covers secure data transfer, passwords, 
computer security habits and knowledge of what constitutes misuse or inappropriate use of the 
server. We will implement multiple, redundant protective measures to guarantee the privacy and 
security of the participant data. All investigators and research staff with direct access to the 
identifiable data will be required to undergo annual responsible conduct of research, 
cybersecurity, and HIPAA certification in accordance with University of Pennsylvania 
regulations. All data for this project will be stored on the secure/firewalled servers of the 
PMACS Data Center, in data files that will be protected by multiple password layers. These data 
servers are maintained in a guarded facility behind several locked doors, with very limited 
physical access rights. They are also cyber-protected by extensive firewalls and multiple layers 
of communication encryption. Electronic access rights are carefully controlled by University of 
Pennsylvania system managers. We will use highly secure methods of data encryption for all 
transactions involving participants’ financial information using a level of security comparable to 
what is used in commercial financial transactions. We believe this multi-layer system of data 
security, identical to the system protecting the University of Pennsylvania Health Systems 
medical records, greatly minimizes the risk of loss of privacy. In addition, risk of loss of 
confidentiality will be minimized by storing completed paper copies of the surveys and signed 
informed consent forms in locked file cabinets in locked offices accessible only to trained study 
staff. Each subject will be assigned a unique identifier without identifying information, and data 
will be entered into an electronic database using only the unique identifier. Only trained study 
staff will have access to the code that links the unique identifier to the subject’s identity. 
Electronic data will be stored on secure, password-protected firewalled servers at the University 
of Pennsylvania. 
 
11.3 Subject privacy 
Interested participants will be directed to the Way to Health portal where they will be asked to 
enter data related to eligibility and their demographic characteristics. Enrollment will include a 
description of the voluntary nature of participation, the study procedures, risks and potential 
benefits in detail. The enrollment procedure will provide the opportunity for potential 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 2, 2019
  
 
participants to ask questions and review the consent form information with family and friends 
prior to making a decision to participate. Participants will be told that they do not have to answer 
any questions if they do not wish and can drop out of the study at any time, without affecting 
their medical care or the cost of their care. They will be told that they may or may not benefit 
directly from the study and that all information will be kept strictly confidential, except as 
required by law. Subjects will be given a copy of the consent document. All efforts will be made 
by study staff to ensure subject privacy. 
 
11.4 Data disclosure 
The following entities, besides the members of the research team, may receive protected health 
information (PHI) for this research study: -Wells Fargo, the company which processes study-
related payments. Patient addresses and account balances will be stored on their secure 
computers. –P’unk Ave., LLC, a software development company designing the Way to Health 
website. P’unk Ave. will not store any of the patients' PHI, but they will have access to de-
identified patient information, for the purposes of website administration and development. - 
Misfit Wearables, the company that designs and manufactures the wearable devices used in the 
study to track participant physical activity. -Twilio, Inc., the company which processes some 
study-related messages. Twilio will store patients' phone numbers on their secure computers. -
Qualtrics, Inc., the company which processes most study-related surveys. Qualtrics will house 
de-identified answers to these surveys on their secure servers. -The Office of Human Research 
Protections at the University of Pennsylvania -Federal and state agencies (for example, the 
Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health, and/or the Office 
for Human Research Protections), or other domestic or foreign government bodies if required by 
law and/or necessary for oversight purposes. 
 
11.5 Data safety and monitoring 
At the time of discharge from the hospital, all patients are given anticipatory guidance on when 
to seek medical attention.  In addition, participants will be asked to report to the study team any 
episodes of chest pain, shortness of breath or other changes during periods of exercise.  They will 
be reminded of this at the end of each week of the study.  They can either call the study team or 
send an email.  The research coordinator will call the participant to collect information regarding 
the issue and then the PI will review and determine whether it is ok to proceed, further 
investigation is needed, or the participant should stop the study.  If the participant happens to 
also enroll in a standard cardiac rehabilitation program and is told that they should be pursuing a 
different step count than in the study, they will be asked to report that to the study team and their 
study count goal may be adjusted. 
 
11.6 Risk/benefit  
 
 
11.6.1 Potential study risks 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 2, 2019
  
 
To minimize the chance for serious and unexpected adverse events, study participants will be 
screened through exclusion criteria for any health conditions that may be exacerbated by 
participating in a physical activity study. The home-based rehab program tries to motivate a 
gradual step count increase that should pose little health risk to participants.  Participants are 
given guidance on when to seek medical attention and a reporting protocol is in place to capture 
any changes in symptoms with physical activity. Another potential risk of this study is a breach 
of participant confidentiality. We will minimize this risk by linking individual identifying 
information with participant ID numbers only in one single secure file that will only be accessed 
by the study team in the case of an adverse medical event, participant dropout, or if otherwise 
deemed necessary by the Principal Investigator. All other identifying information will be 
discarded after initial contact with the Study Coordinator. Due to the financial incentives in this 
study, we will be collecting social security numbers so that we can complete W-9 forms for 
participants. Social security numbers only will be used to generate W-9 forms and will be deleted 
once they are no longer needed. We will also collect home addresses to mail incentive payments. 
This will be done through a University of Pennsylvania approved partnership with Wells Fargo. 
Accidental disclosure of social security numbers could lead to identity theft. We will use 
commercial-grade encryption to protect social security information in transit. Names and 
addresses will be stored in encrypted databases. These data will be viewable only by the 
respective participants and the study coordinator. All other members of the research team will be 
able to view only participant ID numbers. There will be no functionality in the web application 
to export a dataset with identifiable information. Even the study arms will be identified by code 
letters until both the statistician and PI agree that analysis is complete. 
 
 
11.6.2 Potential study benefits 
Through participation in this study, each participant will have the potential to increase their 
physical activity, which could improve their health and reduce their risk for future cardiovascular 
disease or other conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. If this approach is 
effective, it could have tremendous benefits for society if adopted on a wide scale to help 
individuals increase physical activity after discharge from the cardiology service. It is expected 
that other people will gain knowledge from this study and that participation could help 
understand how to effectively motivate people to become more physically active. Participants 
may also receive no benefit from their participation in the study. 
 
 
11.6.3 Risk/benefit assessment 
Anticipated risks of this study should be minimal and the risk/benefit ratio is very favorable. To 
minimize the chance for serious and unexpected adverse events, study participants will be 
screened through exclusion criteria for any health conditions that may be exacerbated by 
participating in a physical activity study. Participants that increase physical activity may improve 
their health and reduce their risk for future cardiovascular disease or other conditions such as 
diabetes, hypertension, and osteoarthritis.
