Abstract. The majority of mutations causing familial Alzheimer’s disease (fAD) have been found in the gene PRESENILIN1
(PSEN1) with additional mutations in the related gene PRESENILIN2 (PSEN2). The best characterized function of PRESE-
NILIN (PSEN) proteins is in �-secretase enzyme activity. One substrate of �-secretase is encoded by the gene AMYLOID
BETA A4 PRECURSOR PROTEIN (A�PP/APP) that is a fAD mutation locus. A�PP is the source of the amyloid-� (A�)
peptide enriched in the brains of people with fAD or the more common, late onset, sporadic form of AD, sAD. These
observations have resulted in a focus on �-secretase activity and A� as we attempt to understand the molecular basis of
AD pathology. In this paper we briefly review some of the history of research on �-secretase in AD. We then discuss the
main ideas regarding the role of �-secretase and the PSEN genes in this disease. We examine the significance of the “fAD
mutation reading frame preservation rule” that applies to PSEN1 and PSEN2 (and A�PP) and look at alternative roles for
A�PP and A� in fAD. We present a case for an alternative interpretation of published data on the role of �-secretase activity
and fAD-associated mutations in AD pathology. Evidence supports a “PSEN holoprotein multimer hypothesis” where PSEN

fAD mutations generate mutant PSEN holoproteins that multimerize with wild type holoprotein and dominantly interfere
with an AD-critical function(s) such as autophagy or secretion of A�. Holoprotein multimerization may be required for the
endoproteolysis that activates PSENs’ �-secretase activity.

DISCOVERY OF THE AUTOSOMAL
DOMINANT FAMILIAL ALZHEIMER’S
DISEASE LOCI A�PP, PSEN1 AND PSEN2
In 1906, Alois Alzheimer first identified foci
(plaques) in the cerebral cortex staining in a simi-
lar manner to starch (hence “amyloid”) in the brain
of the late Auguste Deter, a patient who had suf-
fered from presenile dementia [1]. Nearly 80 years
later (in 1985), the discovery that Alzheimer’s dis-
ease (AD) brains and Down syndrome brains share
vascular deposits of amyloid-� (A�) led to the sug-
gestion that AD may be caused by a genetic defect on
Chromosome21[2,3].Thesubsequentdiscoverythat
A� is also found in neuritic plaques in AD brains [4,
5] founded the amyloid hypothesis that A� is central
to the pathological process causing the disease. Great
weight was lent to the amyloid hypothesis by the sub-
sequent identification of a mutation causing familial
AD (fAD) in the A�PP gene [6] and, after the PSEN1
and PSEN2 fAD loci were identified in 1995 [7, 8], by
therealizationthatmutationsinthePSENgenescould
alter A� synthesis [9–12]. (Other, rarer fAD loci have
since been identified, e.g., SORL1 [13, 14]). Subse-
quent molecular analyses including inhibitor studies
have shown that the PSEN proteins form the catalytic
core of the �-secretase enzyme complexes that cleave
A�PP to form A� (e.g., [15–17]). While the effects of
fAD mutations on A� production have been seen to
be variable (for example, see summaries in [18, 19]),
a consistent characteristic is a shift in the ratio of
longer versus shorter forms of A� and this is thought
to favor the formation of purportedly toxic aggre-
gates [19, 20]. Nevertheless, during the past decade,
the amyloid hypothesis has come under increasing
criticism for a number of reasons including the lack
of overt neuronal loss following deposition of human
A� in mouse brains [21] (although synaptic toxic-
ity is apparent [22]) and the failure of therapeutic
approaches based on reduction of A� production or
aggregation [23] (although this may be due to the
advanced disease stages at which treatment has been
attempted [24]). However, it is not the purpose of this
paper to review the vast literature that now addresses
the role of A� in AD. (Interested readers can refer
to a number of excellent reviews on that topic such
as [25–27].) Instead we will focus on the effects of
mutations in the PSEN genes that represent the over-
whelming majority of known fAD mutations.
Before �-secretase can cleave a type I transmem-
brane domain protein (having a luminal/extracellular
N-terminus and a cytosolic C-terminus), the lumi-
nal/extracellular domain must be almost entirely
excised [28]. The luminal/extracellular domain of
A�PP can be cleaved by a number of enzyme activ-
ities (Fig. 1A, 1B) but only cleavage at A�PP’s
“�-site” by a “�-secretase” allows production of the
A� peptide. Subsequent cleavage by �-secretase of
the remaining transmembrane fragment of A�PP,
C99, releases A� and the A�PP intracellular domain,
AICD (see later and Fig. 1A).
ARE PRESENILINS THE ONLY
�-SECRETASES?
For a decade following the identification of the
PSEN loci, there was uncertainty regarding whether
PRESENILIN proteins were �-secretases or the only
source of �-secretase activity. For example, in 2001,
Armogida et al. [29] showed that mouse embryonic
fibroblasts that apparently lacked Psen1 and Psen2
gene activity, indeed lost the ability to cleave within
the transmembrane domain of an introduced Notch1
protein �-secretase substrate. However, they could
still produce 40 and 42 amino acid residue forms
of A� (A�40 and A�42) from endogenous mouse
A�PP.In2002,Wilsonetal.[30]showedthatneurons
harvested from mouse embryos lacking Psen1 and
Psen2 activity could still produce, specifically, A�42
intheendoplasmicreticulum(ER)/intermediatecom-
partment indicating the presence of an additional
�-secretase activity in the early secretory pathway.
In 2003, Taniguchi et al. fractionated membranes
from cells lacking PSEN1 and PSEN2 activity and
identified a fraction with apparent �-secretase activ-
ity but lacking PSEN protein [31]. Lai et al. [32] in
2006 analyzed �-secretase-like activity in the mem-
branes of blastocyst-derived cells and saw continued

followed by �-secretase cleavage is required to produce A� peptides. Panels B, C, and D are modifications of diagrams taken from the
Alzheimer Disease & Frontotemporal Dementia Mutation Database [47]. Red amino acid residues are sites of pathogenic mutation causing
dementia. Green residues are non-pathogenic variants. The pathogenic nature of orange residues is unclear. Transmembrane domains (TM)
and residues encoded by particular exons (Ex) are indicated and numbered. B) Mutations and cleavage sites in A�PP in the region of A�.
Mutations are thought to affect the level of production of A� by changing cleave site preference or affect the structure of A�, or both. The
production of AICD may also be affected. The position of the “protective” A673T mutation [159] is highlighted with a yellow background.
C) Mutations in PSEN1. Residues affected by mutations causing Pick Disease, Familial Acne Inversa and Dilated Cardiomyopathy are
highlighted with a yellow background. Residues deleted by fAD mutations causing loss of exon 9 are highlighted with a pink background.
The L271V mutation causes increased formation of a naturally-occurring PSEN1 isoform lacking residues encoded by exon 8 (highlighted
by a blue background) but it is the simultaneous expression of full-length PSEN1 containing the valine residue at position 271 that apparently
causes fAD [51, 91]. D) Mutations in PSEN2. Residues included in the hypoxia-induced isoform PS2V are highlighted with a green
background. The position of the unique frame-shift fAD mutation K115Efs and of the S130L mutation causing Dilated Cardiomyopathy are
highlighted with yellow background. The “mutations” putatively identified by Kadmiri et al. [121, 122] are upstream of the region shown in
B or are indicated with brown arrows and text in C and D.
production of A� that could not be inhibited with
the �-secretase inhibitor L-685,458. However, the
activity could be inhibited with the general aspartyl
protease inhibitor pepstatin A. The production of A�
was also observed in membranes from blastocyst-
derived cells lacking PSEN proteins. Interestingly,
 784
T. Jayne et al. / γ-Secretase Activity in Familial AD
the optimal pH for production of A�40 and A�42
by this activity was pH 6.0 compared to the mea-
sured optimum pH for A� production when the
L-685,458 was not present of closer to pH 7.0.
This suggests that the two activities may be dis-
tributed in different subcellular compartments. The
PSEN-independent �-secretase-like activity was also
responsible for a greater proportion of total A�42
production than of total A�40. Other evidence that
PRESENILINs might not be essential for produc-
tion of A� included that expression of human A�PP
in a yeast species apparently lacking PRESENILIN
orthologs, Pichia pastoris, nevertheless permitted
formation of A� peptides [33]. However, the PRE-
SENILINs were, ultimately, conclusively shown to
function as �-secretases by the demonstration that
transition state analogue inhibitors of �-secretase
bind to the PSENs [34], by reconstruction of the
enzyme complex (consisting of the four proteins
NCSTN, PSENEN, APH1 and PSEN) in the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae [17] and by the demonstra-
tion that recombinant PSEN alone, when expressed in
and purified from bacteria and then reconstituted into
liposomes, retained some ability to cleave A�PP [35].
The studies above suggest that a non-PSEN-
dependent form of �-secretase-like activity can be
present in animal cells and can produce A�. One
protein that may provide this activity is the acidic
aspartyl protease Cathepsin D (CTSD). CTSD is
capable of producing A� in assays where A�PP frag-
ments equivalent to those produced after cleavage by
�-secretase are provided [36, 37]. In human brain,
BACE1 protein appears to provide most of the �-
secretase activity generating A� [38] (although in
vitro studies have indicated that CTSD may also
cleave A�PP at its �-site raising the possibility that
this one protease may be sufficient to produce A�
from A�PP [39]). CTSD shows maximum activ-
ity at pH 3.8 [40] similar to BACE1’s optimum of
pH 4.5 [41]. Curiously, BACE1 is nearly inactive at
pH 6.0 which is the optimum for the �-secretase-
like activity described by Lai et al. above [32]
who also showed that �-secretase has a pH opti-
mum closer to 7! This is despite the fact that a
protein complex has been detected containing both
PSEN1 and BACE1 (together with OPIOID RECEP-
TOR, DELTA-1; OPRD1) [42] indicating that the
�-secretase and �-secretase enzyme activities may
(at least in some situations) be spatially co-located.
However, to confirm that CTSD provides the �-
secretase-like activity in cells lacking PRESENILINs
it will be necessary to analyze A� production in
triple-mutant cells lacking all of PSEN1, PSEN2, and
CTSD.
Finally, it is worth mentioning the fascinat-
ing case of another �-secretase substrate, the
NERVE GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR, NGFR
(p75(NTR)) and its close homolog NRH1. NRH1 is
found in non-mammalian vertebrates while a trun-
cated form, NRH2 (also known as NRADD) exists
in mammals [43]. The sequence similarity between
NGFR and NRH1 points to a relatively recent evo-
lutionary origin by a gene duplication event in
vertebrates. However, unlike NGFR, the apparent
intramembraneous cleavage of NRH1 (and NRH2)
cannot be inhibited by the �-secretase inhibitors
DAPT and WPE [43]. Unpublished preliminary
investigation of the zebrafish orthologue of NRH1
in Lardelli’s laboratory supports these observations.
However, another report on NRH2/NRADD did see
inhibition of cleavage of NRH2 with �-secretase
inhibitors L685,458; DAPT and Compound E [44]
and resolution of these conflicting observations is
required. Was the common ancestor of the NGFR and
NRH1 proteins cleaved by �-secretase or the “other”
unidentified �-secretase-like enzyme? What deter-
mines the susceptibility of a transmembrane protein
to �-secretase cleavage when no clear cleavage site
recognition sequence or motif has been identified?
[45].
CURRENT THINKING ON THE ROLE OF
PRESENILINS IN AD
Less than 1% of AD cases are thought to be due
to autosomal dominant mutations [46]. Nevertheless,
research focused on how these mutations cause AD
at the cellular and molecular level has had enormous
influence on how we view the etiology of both early
onset fAD and the far more common late onset spo-
radic AD (sAD). Over 205 different fAD mutations
have been identified in the PSEN1 gene [47]. In a
large French study of 130 families showing autoso-
mal dominant early-onset AD [14], 82 families (63%)
possessed missense mutations in PSEN1. A further 7
families (5%) showed missense mutations in PSEN2.
Therefore, mutations in the PSEN genes accounted
for over two-thirds of autosomal dominant fAD in the
study. 14 missense mutations in A�PP and 11 dupli-
cations of A�PP (i.e., 19% of families) were also
found. The predominant focus on A� as the cause
of AD pathology has meant that most research on
the role of PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutations in fAD has
 T. Jayne et al. / γ-Secretase Activity in Familial AD
785
examined their effects on cleavage of A�PP and A�
production.
It is a very striking characteristic of the fAD muta-
tions in PSEN1, PSEN2, and AβPP that none of the
hundreds of these fAD mutations cause loss of the
gene (e.g., by deletion) or truncation of the coding
sequences (e.g., by nonsense or frameshift mutations)
[47]. Even mutations causing exon loss from tran-
scripts due to deletion of exon DNA [48] or through
effects on splicing [49–51] result in transcripts with
open reading frames coding for normal C-terminal
sequences. (There are some rare exceptions to this
“fAD mutation reading frame preservation rule” that
are discussed below.) The concentration of the A�PP
fAD mutations near the �-, �-, and �-secretase
cleavage sites in the protein supports that the muta-
tions alter these cleavage events (reviewed in [52]).
However, the fAD mutations in the PSEN proteins
are scattered throughout their peptide chains with a
somewhat higher frequency in their numerous trans-
membrane domains (see Fig. 1C, D). Three basic
ideas have been suggested to explain this lack of any
focus to the position of the fAD mutations in PSEN1
or PSEN2:
1. Mutations in PSEN Proteins Shift the Profile of
A� Production toward Longer Peptides
�-Secretase cleavage of A�PP occurs after the
luminal/extracellular domain of the protein is excised
by �– or �-secretase activity. If A�PP is cleaved by �-
secretase at its �-site (rather than at its �’-site [41, 53]
oratthe�-site,seeFig.1),thenA�peptidesofaround
40 amino acid residues length can subsequently
be formed. Following �– or �-secretase cleavage
of A�PP, the membrane-bound fragment is further
cleaved by the �-secretase enzyme complex at what is
termed the �-site near the cytosolic extent of A�PP’s
transmembrane domain [54–56] (Fig. 1A, 1B). This
“endopeptidase” cleavage by PRESENILIN releases
A�PP’s cytosolic “intracellular domain” (AICD) that
interacts with a number of intracellular signaling
pathways and acts as a transcription factor (reviewed
in [57, 58]). Subsequent “carboxypeptidase” cleav-
ages by PRESENILIN are thought to shorten the
remaining, membrane-embedded portion of A�PP
until its hydrophobicity is sufficiently reduced that it
can escape from the lipid bilayer as soluble A� [59,
60]. The position of the initial �-site cleavage is vari-
able [56] and subsequent cleavages by PRESENILIN
may occur progressively from the carboxy-terminal
(the “progressive proteolysis hypothesis” [61, 62])
along either of two “product lines” governed by the
initial cleavage [61, 63]. An attractive aspect of this
idea is that the many and widely distributed fAD
mutations in the PSEN proteins can be thought of
as generally reducing the efficiency of �-secretase
cleavage of A�PP resulting in the commonly cited
phenomenon of increased A� peptide length in fAD
(e.g., [9, 10]) and sAD [64] brains. This idea also
aligns the apparent effects of fAD mutations in both
of the PSENs with mutations in A�PP that affect
its cleavage by �-secretase, i.e., either type of muta-
tion leads to formation of longer A� forms ([65] see
below).
In support of this apparently unifying molecu-
lar mechanism underlying fAD are the results of
cell-free �-secretase assays published in 2012 by
Ch´
avez-Guti´
errez et al. [63]. These suggest that
fAD mutations in the PSENs need not alter the
initial endopeptidase cleavage of A�PP but consis-
tently decrease the rate of the final carboxypeptidase
cleavage. These researchers also saw that fAD muta-
tions in A�PP apparently shifted the �-secretase
cleavage of A�PP into the product line favoring
formation of A�42. However, despite the apparent
consistency of these results there are also uncertain-
ties. First, within cells, �-secretase is concentrated
in cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich lipid rafts [66,
67] but it is doubtful that cell-free �-secretase assays
involving solubilisation of cell membranes preserve
this environment. This may be significant, since the
thickness of lipid bilayers has been shown to affect
the site of �-secretase cleavage of A�PP with thin-
ner membranes promoting formation of A�42 over
A�40 [68]. Reassuringly, recent research published
by Ch´
avez-Guti´
errez and co-workers assaying A�PP
cleavage in detergent-resistant membranes (lipid-raft
rich) extracted from the prefrontal cortices of fAD
brains, showed a consistent decrease in carboxypep-
tidase cleavage but not endopeptidase cleavage [69].
However, no such change was observed when these
assays were performed on detergent-resistant mem-
branes from sAD brains. The researchers explained
this by citing that A� clearance rather than produc-
tion is thought to be defective in late onset sAD
[70] but, nevertheless, it implies the existence of dif-
ferent mechanisms underlying early onset fAD and
late onset sAD. Also perplexing is the idea that the
“endopeptidase” and “carboxypeptidase” activities
of the �-secretase complex are differentially affected
by mutations in the PSENs when, essentially, these
are most likely an identical enzyme activity imposed
on different lengths of the same substrate protein.
Why does this differential effect occur?
 786
T. Jayne et al. / γ-Secretase Activity in Familial AD
Another troubling aspect of the idea that promo-
tion of A�42 over A�40 production is critical in AD is
the fact that some fAD mutations in PSEN1 dramat-
ically decrease the ability of �-secretase to produce
A� while the shift in the A�42/A�40 ratio need not
be dramatic (e.g. [71]). It is difficult to understand
why a slight isoform ratio shift should be important
in promoting pathology via A� aggregation when,
presumably, aggregation would be inhibited by a
decrease in the total A� concentration (including, as
observed in [71], either no significant change or a
decrease in the concentration of A�42).
2. Changes in the Level of �-Secretase Activity are
Critical
The �-secretase enzyme cleaves over 90 substrate
proteins including those involved in critical forms
of cell signaling such as Notch receptors and NGFR
(reviewed by [72]). In 2007, Shen and Kelleher pro-
posed the Presenilin hypothesis which states that
changes in the activity of the PRESENILINs underlie
fAD and, possibly, sAD [18]. A� is incorporated into
the model by postulating that it may inhibit normal
�-secretase activity (something that has actually been
observed under non-physiological conditions in cell
culture [73]) and that it interferes with synaptic func-
tion and signal transduction. While acknowledging
the diverse functions of the PRESENILINs including
in regulation of Wnt signaling (e.g., by regulating
phosphorylation of �-catenin [74]) and in Ca2+ ion
homeostasis, the hypothesis is primarily �-secretase
focused.
In 2013, Shen, Kelleher, and co-workers published
an analysis stated to support a dominant negative
interaction between fAD mutant forms of PSEN1 and
the wild type (non-mutant) form as would be found in
heterozygous individuals possessing dominant fAD
mutations [75]. In the study, they co-tranfected con-
structs expressing mutant and wild type PSEN1 in a
1:1 ratio at (purportedly) sub-saturating levels into
mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking mouse Psen
genes. They saw reductions in �-secretase activity as
evidenced by reduced production of AICD from co-
transfection with the C99 fragment of A�PP or of the
Notch intracellular domain, NICD, from a truncated
form of the Notch1 receptor. (N-terminally truncated
forms of transmembrane protein such as C99 are
commonly used in �-secretase assays since these
do not require prior membrane-proximal, extracellu-
lar/luminal cleavage in order to become �-secretase
substrates.) However, the reductions in AICD and
NICD were not >50% as one might expect for a
dominant negative effect. While this may be
explained by the claim that the levels of PSEN1 were
not saturating, one needs to remember that, in cell
transfection experiments, only a subset of the cells
present are competent to absorb the expression vec-
tor DNAs [76] and the expression levels of the vectors
in these individual cells can be quite high, while the
expression measured over the total cell population
will be lower. Also, as Thinakaran et al. showed in
1997 [77], cells appear to possess a mechanism that
limits total PSEN protein to a particular level.
In 2015 the debate around the importance of
changes in �-secretase activity gained additional
intensity [78] with the publication of another paper
by Shen, Kelleher, and co-workers with direct rel-
evance to the question of whether fAD mutations
in the PSENs have dominant negative effects on
�-secretase activity. Xia et al. [71] had introduced
fAD mutations of human PSEN1 (L435F or C410Y)
into the endogenous Psen1 gene of mice and found
that levels of de novo A� production (reflecting �-
secretase activity) were reduced by approximately
half in in vitro �-secretase assays of brain tis-
sue from embryonic and 3 month old heterozygous
L435F mice. This does not support a dominant
negative action of L435F mutant Psen1 on the �-
secretase activity of wild type Psen1. The L435F
or C410Y mutant alleles showed almost complete
loss of A�PP cleavage when homozygous. Interest-
ingly, both mutations cause great increases in Psen1
holoprotein levels in heterozygous mouse brains (pre-
sumably due to decreased auto-endoproteolysis of
Psen1thatactivatesthe�-secretaseactivityofthepro-
tein [79]). Endogenous levels of both A�40 and A�42
were decreased in the detergent-resistant (“insolu-
ble”) fraction from 3-month-old heterozygous L435F
mouse brains but little change was seen for the solu-
ble fraction. This suggests either that clearance of A�
was reduced (as might be expected from, e.g., inhib-
ited lysosome function) or even that a homeostatic
mechanism exists to maintain a particular level of A�
expression in brain. However, the A�42/A�40 ratio
was significantly increased in both fractions. We note
also that in the recent study by Ch´
avez-Guti´
errez and
co-workersexaminingdetergentresistantmembranes
fromADbrains,theystate,“Undoubtedly,ourdatado
not support a mutant-mediated “dominant-negative
effect” on the healthy allele”.
The 2015 Xia et al. paper is important, since it
provides evidence of a loss of �-secretase activity
in PSEN1 fAD mutant brains. However, it does not
resolve whether this or changes in the A�42/A�40
 T. Jayne et al. / γ-Secretase Activity in Familial AD
787
ratio are critical to the disease. Indeed, another
Psen1 mutation knock-in model from the labora-
tory of Shen and Kelleher — the G183V mutation
[80] that apparently causes Pick disease (a fron-
totemporal dementia) without A� deposition [81,
82] — also shows decreased �-secretase activity and
A� production. Why should the same phenomena
(decreased �-secretase activity and A� production)
produce two different diseases? This does not sup-
port that decreased �-secretase specifically causes
fAD. However, both Pick disease and AD are
tauopathies where neurons show inclusions con-
taining MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN
TAU (MAPT) [83] and aberrant splicing of PSEN1
transcripts has been observed in sporadic frontotem-
poral dementia [84]. Takashima et al. [85] showed
that PSEN1 protein binds MAPT together with a
kinase that phosphorylates the latter, GLYCOGEN
SYNTHASE KINASE 3-BETA (GSK3B). They also
showed that transfection of fAD mutant forms of
PSEN1 into COS-7 cells could increase phospho-
rylation of MAPT. Saura et al. [86] showed that
loss of both PSEN1 and PSEN2 from the postna-
tal forebrain of mice causes hyperphosphorylation of
MAPT. These observations suggest that decreased �-
secretase activity may be involved with the formation
ofMAPTinclusionsalthoughWatanabeetal.[80]did
not observe these (or changes in the phosphorylation
of MAPT) in the brains of their homozygous G183V
mouse model.
We should note that the G183V mutation of
human PSEN1 is unusual since it affects the spice
donor site of exon 6 and produces both normally
spliced transcripts and transcripts with truncated
open reading frames [81, 83]. The Watanabe et al.
paper shows that these aberrant transcripts are
not completely degraded in brain tissue although
nonsense-medicated mRNA decay appears to remove
them completely in other tissues. We have analyzed
the putative protein products of these aberrant tran-
scripts using assays in zebrafish embryos and have
seen dominant negative effects specifically on Notch
signaling but not on �-secretase cleavage of an A�PP
orthologue [87]. Zebrafish Psen1 peptides equivalent
to those putatively translated from the aberrant tran-
scripts also incorporate specifically and avidly into
detergent-resistant higher molecular weight com-
plexes and bind to both Psen1 and Psen2 proteins
[87]. Therefore, it is possible that the action of trun-
cated forms of PSEN1 protein may underlie the
frontotemporal dementia pathology of the G183V
mutation of human PSEN1.
A very significant advance in our understanding of
�-secretase came in 2015 with publication of the first
detailed atomic structure of the enzyme complex by
Bai et al. [88]. Notably, these researchers introduced
ten different fAD mutations into PSEN1 and saw
no consistent change in �-secretase activity. Some
mutations abolished cleavage of C99, some had little
influence, while other actually increased �-secretase
activity! As Bai et al. stated, “These observations
strongly suggest a disconnection between the total
protease activity of �-secretase and the development
of fAD”. They also observed, “All eight mutations
for which the A�42/A�40 ratio can be calculated led
to increased A�42/A�40 ratios compared with wild-
type �-secretase . . . The generally increased ratios of
A�42 over A�40 may suggest a causal relationship
for development of fAD, but could also be explained
by other possibilities.” We describe two such possi-
bilities later in this paper.
3. Changes in the Non-�-Secretase Activity(ies) of
PSEN Underlie AD Pathology
The �-secretase enzyme is a complex of four pro-
teins and, if reduced �-secretase activity was the
cause of fAD, then we might expect fAD mutations to
occur in the other �-secretase complex components.
Remarkably, these have never been found but muta-
tions in PSEN1, NCSTN, and PSENEN have been
found in another disease, inherited acne inversa [89]
(also known as hidradenitis suppurativa). It is also
very significant that the single known mutation in
PSEN1 causing acne inversa, P242LfsX11 (Fig. 1C),
does not follow the “fAD mutation reading frame
preservation rule” since it causes a frameshift in exon
7 and truncation of the open reading frame. This
mutation does not appear to cause fAD [89].
The existence of 205+ fAD mutations in PSEN1
following the “fAD mutation reading frame preser-
vation rule” and a single PSEN1 mutation that does
not preserve the open reading frame and that causes
a completely different disease, strongly supports that
mutations in PSEN1 can only cause fAD when they
preserve the “full-length” of the protein. A parsi-
monious explanation for this phenomenon may have
been revealed by the Heilig et al. paper [75], that
showed strong association between mutant and wild
type forms of the PSEN1 holoprotein (a phenomenon
also noted by others [90, 91]), and by work from
Nixon and co-workers demonstrating an effect of
fAD PSEN1 mutations on autophagy [92]. In 2010,
Lee et al. showed that heterozygous fAD muta-
tions in PSEN1 inhibit macroautophagy by reducing
 788
T. Jayne et al. / γ-Secretase Activity in Familial AD
N-glycosylation of the V0a1 subunit of vacuolar
[H+] ATPase leading to reduced acidification of lyso-
somes. Subsequently, two other laboratories disputed
these findings [93, 94] leading to a very “vigorous”
debate at the AlzForum online site [95]. How-
ever, increased lysosomal pH due to mutations in
PSEN1 has since been supported by additional work
[96].
The Lee et al. paper notes three remarkable
phenomena: a) It is the PSEN1 holoprotein, not
its endoproteolysed form, that complexes with the
proteins required for N-glycosylation of the V0a1
subunit of the vacuolar [H+] ATPase; b) loss of the
�-secretase complex component NCSTN does not
affect macroautophagy; and, c) chemical inhibition of
�-secretase activity does not affect macroautophagy.
These three phenomena exactly align with what we
know of mutations in PSEN1 causing fAD, i.e., a)
only mutations that preserve the full length of the
PSEN1 holoprotein cause fAD; b) only mutations
in PSEN1 and not other �-secretase complex com-
ponents cause fAD and; c) decreased �-secretase
activity does not cause fAD (since it is observed
in mouse models of human PSEN1 mutations caus-
ing either fAD or FTD and so does not differentiate
between them and since reduced �-secretase activ-
ity causes acne inversa without fAD). This idea is
alsoconsistentwithasingle,fundamentalmechanism
for both fAD and sAD since disturbances of lyso-
somal function have been observed in human fAD
brains [97] and fibroblasts [92] and disturbances of
autophagy have been observed in sporadic late onset
AD brains [98]. Therefore, lysosomal dysfunction
provides a unifying pathological mechanism under-
lying AD. Such a unifying mechanism is important
because, at the genetic level, there is little over-
lap between mutations causing fAD and the genetic
risk loci for sAD identified in genome-wide associa-
tion studies (GWAS). To date, only the gene SORL1
has been identified as a locus in both fAD and
sAD, although other connections are apparent. For
example, a search using human PSEN1 in the gene
co-expression database COXPRESdb [99] shows that
the most tightly co-regulated gene is the sAD risk
locus PICALM (Ebrahimie, Lardelli et al., unpub-
lished results), a locus repeatedly identified in GWAS
[100–103] and that influences autophagy [104]. Also,
a truncated isoform of PSEN2, “PS2V”, is upreg-
ulated in sAD brains [105]. PS2V is induced by
hypoxia/oxidative stress, is associated with increased
production of A� [106, 107], can suppress the
unfolded protein response (UPR) and can boost
�-secretase activity [107, 108] through an unknown
mechanism that may involve interaction with full-
length PSEN protein [87].
Other activities of the PSEN proteins have also
been seen to be dependent on the holoprotein rather
than the endoproteolytically cleaved, �-secretase-
active form. PSEN holoproteins have been proposed
to act as Ca2+ “leak channels” in the ER with fAD
mutants unable to perform this function [65, 109]. In
2009, Schon and co-workers showed that the PSEN
proteins are concentrated in a particular, specialized
functional domain of the ER where it is closely juxta-
posed to mitochondria, the “mitochondria associated
membranes” (MAM, see [110]). Formation of pro-
tein disulphide bonds occurs in the MAM involving
relatively large amounts of H2O2 formation (oxida-
tive protein folding, reviewed by [111]). The MAM
is comprised of detergent resistant membrane with
the characteristics of a lipid raft [110, 112]. It is
responsible for cholesteryl ester and phospholipid
synthesis [112], controls mitochondrial activity and
apoptosis via Ca2+ signaling (reviewed in [113]),
is a site of autophagosome initiation [114] and is
required for innate immune inflammatory responses
[115]. Therefore, the MAM is a nexus for cellular
activities and phenomena commonly associated with
AD pathology. Indeed, Schon’s laboratory has shown
that fibroblasts from both fAD and sAD individu-
als exhibit increased MAM formation leading to the
hypothesis that it is dysfunction in communication
between the ER and mitochondria that causes AD
(the “MAM hypothesis”, [116]). While changes in
PSEN expression and function can alter the degree of
MAM formation in cells, MAM formation does not
appear to be dependent on �-secretase activity, imply-
ing that it is changes in PSEN holoprotein function
that are critical.
In summary, we suggest that a parsimonious expla-
nation for the PSEN “fAD mutation reading frame
preservation rule” and the dominant nature of these
mutations is a “PSEN holoprotein multimer hypoth-
esis” whereby fAD mutations in PSEN1 or PSEN2
cause disruption of a holoprotein function (or func-
tions) that are critical for maintenance of cellular
homeostasis in an aging brain. The mutations are
dominant due to inhibitory multimerization of mutant
holoproteins with wild type holoprotein. The hypoth-
esis is summarized in Fig. 2 (showing the possibility
that the fAD-critical function disrupted by mutation
oftheholoproteinisN-glycosylationoftheV0a1sub-
unit of vacuolar [H+] ATPase as suggested by Lee
et al., [92]).

Fig. 2. Hypothetical model of action of PSEN1 holoprotein including multimerization and a possible interaction with HIF1�. PSEN holo-
proteins can form multimers and these multimers may be necessary for the endoproteolysis that activates �-secretase activity. Mutations
that preserve the open reading frames of PSENs may allow mutant holoproteins to bind to wild type holoproteins and inhibit holoprotein-
dependent activities that are critical to cellular homeostasis in ageing brains. Under hypoxic conditions HIF1� may normally interact with
multimeric holoprotein complexes to stimulate formation of active �-secretase. Normal lysosome acidification may be required for correct
metabolism and/or secretion of A�PP, AICD and A�.
REAL AND ARTEFACTUAL EXCEPTIONS
TO THE “FAD MUTATION READING
FRAME PRESERVATION RULE”
Until recently no possible exceptions were known
to the rule that fAD mutations preserve the open
reading frames of PSEN1, PSEN2, and A�PP. How-
ever, in 2010, Jayadev et al. published a report on
fAD mutations in PSEN2 that included discovery
of a two nucleotide deletion causing a frameshift
near the downstream end of exon 4 followed shortly
thereafter by a premature termination of the open
reading frame. If this mutant allele, K115Efs, pro-
duces a protein product then it would resemble
the PS2V isoform mentioned previously that can
both increase �-secretase activity (and hence A�
production) and inhibit the UPR by an unknown
mechanism [107, 108] (see Fig. 1D). (The two phe-
nomena may be mechanistically related [117].) Since
PS2V is observed to be upregulated in sAD brains,
the K115Efs mutation may provide another link
between the pathologies of fAD and sAD [108].
However, K115Efs may be mechanistically unique
amongthePSENfADmutationssinceitmayenhance
A� production (or A�PP signaling) via increasing
�-secretase activity or it may promote A� oligomer-
ization via suppression of the UPR (or both) rather
than inhibiting A� breakdown and/or secretion via
autophagy [118–120].
In 2014, Kadmiri et al. published two papers
reporting the discovery of frameshift mutations in
Moroccan fAD families [121, 122]. In both papers it
isclaimedthat17sporadiccasesofADandeightfam-
ilieswithADwereexamined,sopresumablythesame
patient cohort forms the basis for both studies. In
one paper they claim to have discovered seven novel
frameshift mutations in A�PP, three of which occur
in families [121]. Remarkably, one particular mutant
allele was discovered in three apparently separate
families and, in one family, the proband possessed
two separate frameshift alleles while an unaffected
relative had a mutation affecting an A�PP transcript
splice site! No mis-sense mutations in A�PP were
reported. If we consider that the Alzheimer Dis-
ease & Frontotemporal Dementia Mutation Database
lists 26 different A�PP mutations discovered for
 790
T. Jayne et al. / γ-Secretase Activity in Familial AD
AD (10 complete gene duplications and 16 missense
mutations) from tens of separate publications, the
likelihood that so many novel, unprecedented fAD
mutations in A�PP would be discovered in one study
is infinitesimally small. In their second paper [122]
Kadmiri et al. claim to have found frameshift muta-
tions in exon 10 of PSEN1 (Fig. 1C) and in exons
5 and 9 of PSEN2 (Fig. 1D). The mutations were
apparently found in three different families with no
mutations found in sAD cases. However, no analy-
sis of DNA from two or more affected individuals
within a family is reported. Once again, with over
220 different mutations found collectively in PSEN1
and PSEN2 in dozens of separate studies, none of
which destroy the open reading frame of the genes,
the probability is extremely small that three differ-
ent such mutations could be found within only eight
AD families. For these reasons we consider it highly
unlikely that the data in these two papers is reliable
and verification of the data is essential before they
can be regarded as part of the fAD mutation knowl-
edge base. Unfortunately, the “mutations” the papers
report have already been cited uncritically elsewhere
in the scientific literature [123].
WHAT THEN OF A�PP, A�, AND THE
A�42/A�40 RATIO?
The fact that mutations in the three major fAD
genes all affect production of the A� peptide has
been the most convincing evidence for the central-
ity of A� in the etiology of fAD. Therefore, if we are
to discount changes in �-secretase activity as being
causative of fAD, another mechanism must be found
by which mutations affecting the PSENs and A�PP
can have inter related effects. In this light it may well
be significant that A�PP is a substrate of chaperone-
mediated autophagy [124] and that autophagy is
involved in both the secretion and breakdown of A�
[119]. A�PP has also been shown to have a very
wide range of cellular functions. A�PP influences
Fe ion homeostasis via its interaction with Ferro-
portin (SLC40A1, [125]) and A�PP affects embryo
development, including vascular development, possi-
bly via secretion of its extracellular/luminal domain
[126, 127] and A� [128]. A�PP also influences the
rate of protein synthesis [129], neurite outgrowth
[130], and axonal pruning [131] as well as LPS-
mediated innate immune responses [132]. Signaling
via AICD regulates genes including MEMBRANE
METALLOENDOPEPTIDASE (MME, also known as
neprilysin) [133] and TRANSTHYRETIN, TTR [134]
that encode proteins involved in degradation and
clearance of A� from the CNS, respectively. One or
moreofthesefunctionsmayinteractwithPSENholo-
protein activities. For example, alterations in PSEN
gene expression affect metal homeostasis [135] and
PSEN2 is also known to influence LPS-mediated
innate immune responses while PSEN1 may not
[136].
Therearemanydifferentlengthsof peptidecleaved
from the membrane-proximal region of A�PP. These
can also carry various forms of chemical modifica-
tion that may influence their role in AD pathogenesis
(reviewed by [137]). However, the most inten-
sively studied peptides derived from A�PP are A�40
and A�42. For many years these forms of A�
were regarded as unfortunately toxic but otherwise
functionless by-products of A�PP cleavage [138].
However, numerous lines of evidence now argue
against this. The sequence of A� is highly con-
served in species as distantly related as primates
(humans) and lobe-finned fishes (Coelacanth) [128]
implying that mutations in A� are selectively disad-
vantageous. A� has neuroprotective properties [139]
and may act variously as an antioxidant [140–145],
in vascular development [128, 146] and function
[147], as a regulator of long term potentiation [148]
and even as an antimicrobial peptide of the innate
immune system [149]. A� has also been implicated
as a transcription factor. In 2011, Lahiri and col-
leagues claimed the existence of a DNA sequence
motif binding A� in the promoters of the A�PP,
BACE1, and APOE genes [150, 151]. In 2012, Piccini
et al. [152] showed upregulation of BACE1 expres-
sion specifically by A�42 (but not A�40) applied to
neuroblastoma cells apparently via the JNK signaling
pathwayandin2014Barackeretal.[153]showedthat
cells can absorb A� and transport it into nuclei where,
specifically, A�42 (but not other isoforms) can form
transcriptional complexes to repress expression of the
genes LRP1 and KAI1. A� is upregulated by cellu-
lar stress, in particular hypoxia [154–156]. This is
a selectively advantageous protective response since
the molecular mechanism for upregulating A� under
hypoxia/oxidative stress appears conserved in both
zebrafish and humans, species that shared a com-
mon ancestor almost half a billion years ago [157].
The production of A� is very responsive to the level
of expression of BACE1 [158] which itself is sensi-
tive to hypoxia [154–156]. The “protective mutation”
in A�PP (A673T) identified in studies of the Ice-
landic population and that reduces BACE1 cleavage
 T. Jayne et al. / γ-Secretase Activity in Familial AD
791
of A�PP by around 40% [159] can be seen in this
light. The mutation may well be reducing the cellu-
lar dysfunction that can accompany an over-vigorous
protective response, much as reducing inflammatory
responses can reduce cancer risk [160] or improve
wound healing [161]. This is supported by the work
of Weihong Song and colleagues [162] who showed
that, in fact, the most common site of cleavage of
A�PP by BACE1 is the �’ site that prevents A� for-
mation by forming a shorter peptide (see Fig. 1). They
also showed that the fAD-causing “Swedish” double
mutation of A�PP inhibits this cleavage so that cleav-
age at the alternative �-site producing A� becomes
more frequent. In this case the Swedish mutation may
be seen as causing an upregulated stress response.
Recently, Villa et al. [163] showed that the
master regulator of cellular responses to hypoxia,
HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE
FACTOR
1,
ALPHA
SUBUNIT (HIF1�), binds directly to �-secretase
complexes to upregulate �-secretase activity under
low oxygen. This upregulation did not require
increased transcription of �-secretase complex com-
ponents. Rather it appeared to be due to activation
of existing “inactive �-secretase”. It is possible
that, under hypoxic stress, HIF1� promotes the
endoproteolysis of a pre-existing pool of PSEN
holoprotein to form active �-secretase. Hypoxia is
a form of cellular stress increasingly identified in
AD [164, 165] and one implication of Villa and
colleagues’ analysis is that fAD mutations might
affect the effectiveness of this cellular response
via alteration of an interaction (direct or indirect)
between PSEN holoprotein and HIF1�. Hypoxia
also upregulates autophagy [166] consistent with the
role of PSEN1 holoprotein in lysosomal acidification
and the concentration of PSEN proteins in the MAM.
It is particularly intriguing that, in transgenic mice,
expression of human fAD mutant forms of PSEN1
exclusively in neurons can cause a microvascular
phenotype of abnormally looped vessels as well
as “string vessels” [167]. A� peptides are known
to be vasoactive [168] and their secretion requires
autophagy [118] making them a candidate for a
mechanism of communication between neurons
and brain microvasculature. Since A� levels are so
responsive to hypoxia (e.g., [169, 170]), we can
speculate that the increase in brain A� deposition
seen decades before onset of sAD [171] may be
driven by the inability of aging brain vasculature to
deliver sufficient oxygen. PSEN fAD mutations that
promote abnormal microvascular phenotypes may
thereby predispose to, and accelerate the onset of,
AD. (See also a recent comprehensive review of the
role of vasculature in AD by Di Marco et al., [172]).
Lastly, we should examine another of the strongest
pieces of evidence used to support the pathologi-
cal role of A�42 (and hence the pathological role
of apparent changes in the endopeptidase activity of
�-secretase): The close and highly statistically sig-
nificantinverse-correlationofvariationinA�42/A�40
ratio with the mean age of onset of various fAD muta-
tions in PSEN [173, 174]. As ever, we must remember
that correlation is not causation and that change in
the A�42/A�40 ratio may be acting as a very tight
marker of the severity of another change in PSEN
function that is actually causing the disease. In 1997,
Cook et al. [175] used three independent methods to
show that preventing the movement of A�PP from the
ER/intermediatecompartmenttotheGolgiinneurons
greatly reduced A�40 while leaving A�42 production
unaffected. In the same year, Hartmann et al. [176]
used labeling of subcellular structures with mono-
clonal antibodies specifically binding either A�42 or
A�40 to show the specific production of A�42 in the
ER of neurons. As Area-Gomez et al. [110] showed,
most of the �-secretase activity in the ER is located
in the MAM so, if change in PSEN function leads to
increased association between the ER and mitochon-
dria (increased MAM), we could expect the ratio of
A�42 to A�40 to increase even if overall �-secretase
activity is decreased. Alternatively, Lai et al. [32]
showed that the PSEN-independent, �-secretase-like
activity they detected specifically favors A�42 pro-
duction so reduction in PSEN-dependent �-secretase
activity would again be expected to increase the ratio
of A�42 to A�40. As quoted previously, Bai et al. saw
increases in the A�42/A�40 ratio for all of the vari-
ous fAD mutations that they introduced into human
PSEN1 and that showed detectable A� production.
However, their data support that the increase in the
ratio is an intrinsic property of the mutant PSEN
molecule itself since they apparently analyzed the
activity of highly purified �-secretase in an in vitro
assay system [88].
CONCLUSION
If we accept that there is strong evidence impli-
cating a primary role for PSEN holoproteins in fAD
then particular questions arise. Is lysosomal acidi-
fication the relevant function of PSEN holoproteins
affected in fAD, or is it changes in Ca2+ homeosta-
sis or some other, yet unknown function? Where
 792
T. Jayne et al. / γ-Secretase Activity in Familial AD
within cells do pools of PSEN holoprotein exist
and what affects their equilibrium with �-secretase
complexes? What controls holoprotein stability? Do
PSEN holoproteins function as dimers/multimers?
How do fAD mutations affect holoprotein multi-
merization and function? With what molecules do
holoproteins specifically interact and what differ-
ent forms of holoprotein complex exist? Does the
presence of mutant PSEN1 holoprotein increase the
association of the ER with mitochondria and, if so,
how does this occur? In what cell types are the func-
tion of PSEN holoproteins critical for fAD? Is the
fAD-critical function of PSEN holoproteins mainly
in neurons or are there critical functions in astro-
cytes, microglia and other neural cell types? How do
changes in the rate of �-, �-, and �-secretase cleavage
of A�PP influence the fAD-critical PSEN holopro-
tein functions? It is clear that there is still a long way
to travel to understand how mutations in the PSEN
and AβPP genes cause AD but testing of this “PSEN
holoprotein multimer hypothesis” may make the path
a little clearer. A 2015 paper from Nixon and cowork-
ers has shown that raised lysosomal pH due to loss
of PSEN1 contributes to failure of cytosolic Ca2+
ion homeostasis. Lee et al., 2015, Cell Reports 12,
1430–1444.
