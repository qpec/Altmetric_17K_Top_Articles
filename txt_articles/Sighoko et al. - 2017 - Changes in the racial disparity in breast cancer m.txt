either grew or remained the same.
Conclusions Chicago’s improvement in NHB breast can-

Introduction
Over the past twenty years, mortality related to breast 
cancer has fallen significantly nationwide [1]. However, 
disparity in Non-Hispanic black (NHB) compared to Non-
Hispanic white (NHW) breast cancer mortality has been 
growing across the United States since the 1990s with wide 
geographic variability today [2–4]. In the most recently 
available data (2010–2014 time period), NHB women are 
43.1% more likely to die from breast cancer compared to 
NHW women at the national level [4]. In Chicago, the 
growth in the disparity over the 15 years leading up to 2003 
was more pronounced than the nation as a whole [5, 6]. The 
NHB mortality rate was 68% higher than the corresponding 
rate for NHW in 2003, whereas in 1991 there was no NHB/
NHW mortality disparity [5].
Public concern regarding this growing disparity in Chi-
cago led to the creation in 2007, of a task force, which 
became known as the Metropolitan Chicago Breast Can-
cer Task Force (MCBCTF). The MCBCTF called to action 
over 100 community/healthcare partners from 74 organi-
zations and convened working groups for nine months 
[7]. Informed by Chicago-based research, including focus 
Abstract 
Purpose Assess progress made to reduce racial dispar-
ity in breast cancer mortality in Chicago compared to nine 
other cities with largest African American populations and 
the US.
Methods The Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and Non-His-
panic White (NHW) female breast cancer mortality rates 
and rate ratios (RR) (disparity) were compared between 
1999 and 2005 and 2006 and 2013.
Results Between the two periods, the NHB breast can-
cer mortality rate in Chicago decreased by 13.9% (95% 
CI [−13.81, −13.92] compared to 7.7% (95% CI [−7.52, 
−7.83]) for NHW. A drop of 20% in the disparity was 
observed, from 51% (RR: 1.51, 95% CI [−7.52, −7.83]) 
to 41% (RR: 1.41, 95% CI [1.30, 1.52]). Whereas from 
1999 to 2005 Chicago’s disparity was above that of the 
U.S., from 2006 to 2013, it is now slightly lower. For the

groups, town hall meetings and a mammography capacity, 
and mammography quality survey and participants’ own 
experiences with the Chicago breast health system, along 
with additional research that found a much lower disparity 
in New York City [8], the MCBCTF explored three guiding 
hypotheses as explanations for the racial inequity in female 
breast cancer mortality in Chicago: (1) black women 
receive fewer mammograms, (2) black women receive 
mammograms of inferior quality, and (3) black women 
receive lower quality treatment for breast cancer, once diag-
nosed [7]. In 2008, MCBCTF was formally incorporated 
as a not-for-profit organization with thirty-seven specific 
recommendations that arose from the Task Force delibera-
tions to guide initial project strategies [9]. The MCBCTF 
embarked on broad-based public health, public policy, and 
quality improvement focused initiatives to reduce the NHB/
NHW breast cancer mortality disparity in Chicago with the 
ultimate goal of eliminating the NHB/NHW breast cancer 
mortality disparity in Chicago [10, 11].
The purpose of this analysis is to compare the breast 
cancer mortality disparity in Chicago to corresponding 
trends in mortality disparities in other large urban areas 
with significant African American populations and to the 
United States as a whole, so as to assess progress made in 
reducing the racial disparity in breast cancer in Chicago, 
compared to other cities and the US.
Methods
Population
Chicago and 9 cities that had (1) at least 500,000 people in 
the total population and (2) the largest number of African 
Americans (the U.S. Census 2010 “The Black Population” 
Table 6), were included in the study, as well as US nation-
wide data. Cities selected based on these criteria were Bal-
timore, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Memphis, 
New York City, Philadelphia and Washington District of 
Columbia.
All breast cancer (BC) deaths coded C50.0–C50.9 using 
the International Classification for Disease 10 (ICD-10) 
between 1999 and 2013 were extracted from the National 
Center for Health Statistics databases. The extracted data 
were restricted to NHW and women. Person-years (p-years) 
were obtained from the US Census Bureau. Population by 
5-year age groups for the individual 15 years of our study 
were available for the US, Baltimore, New York City, Phil-
adelphia, and Washington District of Columbia. For Chi-
cago, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, and Memphis, 
the P-years were estimated using linear extrapolation and 
interpolation of the 2000 and 2010 population from the US 
Census Bureau by 5-year age group.
Statistical analysis
The overall mortality rates were adjusted to the 2000 US 
standard population and were calculated by direct stand-
ardization. To assess the mortality and disparity trends 
over the 15 years of the study (1999–2013), the annual 
percentage changes (APC) with 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) were obtained using Joinpoint regression program 
[12]. The analyses were then stratified into two time peri-
ods: 1999–2005, which corresponds to the period before 
the mortality gap was reported in Chicago and 2006–2013, 
which includes years following the first Chicago report on 
the disparity. The disparity was assessed using the NHB/
NHW rate ratio (RR) with 95% CI, for these two periods. 
The percent changes with 95% CI were calculated for the 
two periods. As another measure of disparity, the mortal-
ity risk difference (RD) and 95% CI were calculated across 
the two time periods. Excess deaths among NHB stemming 
from the NHB:NHW disparity were obtained by applying 
the age-specific NHW breast cancer mortality rate to the 
age-specific NHB population. These were then totaled and 
subtracted from the NHB observed number of deaths. The 
difference is the excess breast cancer mortality deaths due 
to the disparity. In order to assess if the trend in the racial 
disparity in breast cancer mortality in Chicago was specific 
to breast cancer, we also examined disparity trends in colon 
cancer mortality over the same period of time. All statis-
tical analyses were conducted with STATA.14 (StataCorp. 
2015. Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. College Sta-
tion, TX: StataCorp LP.)
Results
Annual percent change in breast cancer mortality 
by race (1999−2013)
During the period 1999–2013, the NHW and NHB female 
breast cancer mortality rates decreased for the United 
States as a whole, though the annual percent change (APC) 
in mortality declined more slowly for NHB compared to 
NHW women (APC: −1.4, 95 CI [−1.5, −1.2] vs. −1.9, 
95 CI [−2.0. −1.8], respectively, Table 1). There was con-
siderable variation in APC by race across the ten cities 
between 1999 and 2013. Seven of the ten cities experienced 
a decline in NHW breast cancer mortality. Three of the ten 
cities experienced a significant drop in NHB breast cancer 
mortality (Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia), while 
the other seven cities experienced no statistically significant 
decline in NHB breast cancer mortality (Baltimore, Dallas, 
Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Memphis, and Washington 
DC) (Table 1).

Change in breast cancer mortality by race (1999–2005 
vs. 2006–2013)
Next, we compared mortality rates for two specific time 
periods: 1999–2005 and 2006–2013. For the United 
States as a whole, a larger breast cancer mortality rate 
decline was seen for NHW than for NHB women (–13.8, 
(95 CI [−13.45, −13.52]) vs. −10.05%, (95% CI [−10.03, 
−10.07]) respectively, Table 2). After excluding Detroit, 
(which had unstable mortality rates for NHW women due 
to small NHW sample size) larger breast cancer mortality 
rates declines were seen for NHW than for NHB women 
for all but one city (Chicago). Over the period 2006–2013, 
the NHB breast cancer mortality rate in Chicago decreased 
more than the NHW breast cancer mortality rate (13.9 (95 
CI [−13.81, −13.92] vs. 7.7% decline, 95% CI [−7.52, 
−7.83]) respectively, Table 2). Chicago’s NHB breast can-
cer mortality rate decrease was the largest of all the cities 
analyzed, followed by New York and then Philadelphia.
From 1999 to 2005, the NHB/NHW breast cancer mor-
tality disparity in Chicago increased annually by 3.9% (95% 
CI [0.0; 7.9]) but that trend reversed during the time period 
2006 to 2013, when the mortality disparity decreased annu-
ally by −3.1% (95% CI [−5.4; −0.8]). As a result, whereas 
Chicago’s mortality disparity was greater than for the US 
during 1999–2005, Chicago’s mortality disparity was 
slightly lower than for the US during 2006–2013 (Table 3).
Comparison of breast to colon cancer mortality trends 
in Chicago
We compared trends in breast cancer mortality by race in 
Chicago to the corresponding trends in colorectal cancer 
mortality during the time period 1999–2013. Colon can-
cer mortality rates decreased during this period regardless 
of race resulting in annual average reduction in the colon 
cancer mortality disparity of 0.3%. From 1999 to 2005, 
the colon cancer mortality disparity was similar to that for 
breast cancer; however, for the period from 2006 to 2013, 
the breast cancer mortality disparity decreased while the 
colon cancer mortality disparity remained unchanged.
Excess number of deaths due to breast cancer for NHB 
women
Compared to the other nine cities and the US as a whole, 
NHB women in Chicago experienced the highest drop in 
breast cancer mortality rate in the nation, followed by New

York City (Table 2). The number of excess deaths due to 
breast cancer for NHB women in Chicago declined by 
29%: from 537 cases in 1999–2005 to 394 in 2006–2013 
(Table 4). In contrast, the NHB/NHW breast cancer mortal-
ity disparity in the US as a whole grew corresponding to a 
22% increase in the excess number of deaths due to breast 
cancer for NHB, from 12,177 to 14,897 between these two 
periods (Table 4).
Discussion
There are three major observations from this study on NHB 
and NHW breast cancer mortality in the ten US cities with 
greater than 500,000 people and largest NHB populations. 
First, in the United States as a whole and in most of the 
cities included in this study, breast cancer mortality has 
declined for both NHB and NHW, although the NHW 
breast cancer mortality reduction has been steeper than 
that for NHB. Nationally, this difference has resulted in a 
growing NHB/NHW disparity with a greater NHB to NHW 
disparity in the period 2006–2013 compared to the years 
1999–2005. Advances in breast cancer screening and treat-
ment are having an impact across both races in most cities, 
but because NHB breast cancer mortality rate reductions 
have lagged in many cities, and in a few cities have actually 
risen, the health inequity has grown, nationally.
The second observation from these data is the pres-
ence of tremendous geographic variation in NHW and 
NHB breast cancer mortality and disparity. The reasons

for the geographic variation are unclear though they are 
likely driven by structural issues rather than biological 
variation such as access to health care, including state 
variation in Medicaid coverage even prior to the Afford-
able Care Act, variation in healthcare quality, health 
insurance rates, structural racism, and dysfunction of the 
health care safety-net. A recent study on fifty US cities 
looking at Black/White breast cancer mortality dispari-
ties from 2005 to 2014 notes this variability [4].
In our study, the NHW breast cancer mortality rates 
declined for the periods 1999–2005 and 2006–2013, 
in every city except Detroit, where NHW breast cancer 
mortality rose between the two time periods. Between 
these two time periods, NHB breast cancer mortality 
declined in three cities, (New York, Philadelphia, and 
Chicago) and was flat or rose in the other seven major 
cities. These geographic variations in disparity are driven 
by both racial groups’ mortality rates and the relative 
change between them. The NHW breast cancer mortal-
ity rates across the ten cities vary by about 10 deaths 
per 100,000 from the lowest NHW mortality city in the 
period 2006–2013 (Memphis) to the highest NHW mor-
tality city (Baltimore). The NHB breast cancer mortality 
rates vary by 15 deaths per 100,000 from the lowest NHB 
mortality city (New York City) to the highest NHB mor-
tality city (Houston).
The third observation is that the NHB/NHW breast can-
cer mortality disparity in Chicago has dropped in contrast 
to the national trend. In the period 1999–2005, Chicago 
had among the highest NHB to NHW breast cancer dispar-
ity in the nation. This disparity was the result of a very high 
breast cancer mortality rate for NHB women, compared 
with a declining rate for NHW women. From 1999 to 2005, 
the NHB breast cancer mortality rate in Chicago was the 
third highest among the ten cities. In contrast, from 2006 
to 2013, the NHB/NHW breast cancer disparity decreased 
by almost 20%, largely because of an almost 14% drop in 
NHB breast cancer mortality. This decline in NHB breast 
cancer deaths is the largest observed in the ten cities com-
paring the two time periods. Chicago is also the only city 
of the ten cities where the NHB breast cancer mortality rate 
dropped faster (13.9%) than the NHW (7.7%) breast cancer 
mortality rate. Chicago’s mortality rate decrease for NHW 
(7.7%) is lower than the NHW decrease in most other cities, 
thus also contributing to a lowering of the overall disparity 
in mortality outcomes in Chicago. In contrast to breast can-
cer disparities, analysis of NHB to NHW colorectal cancer 
mortality disparity showed no improvement comparing the 
same time periods.
Elimination of health disparities remains a major public 
health goal in the United States [13]. Yet, mortality dispar-
ity for breast cancer is increasing rather than decreasing 
[1]. However, Chicago’s sharp reduction in the NHB breast 
cancer mortality rate and NHB/NHW breast cancer mortal-
ity disparity stands in contrast with the national trend.
Observational time-trend mortality analyses do not lend 
themselves to causal explanations. However, one reason for 
the observed sharp reduction in NHB breast cancer mor-
tality rate in Chicago could be the public health attention 
that racial disparity in breast cancer mortality has received 
in Chicago. In 2007, researchers and health activists made 
reducing the racial gap in breast cancer mortality a pub-
lic health priority in Chicago. The Metropolitan Breast 
Cancer Taskforce was established as a not for profit dedi-
cated exclusively to eliminating this disparity. Chicago-
based research over this time period documented a wide 
array of structural and quality inequities, including poorer 
mammography quality, missed breast cancer for minority 
and lower-income women leading to later stage diagnosis 
[14–16], absence of American College of Radiology Breast 
Imaging Centers of Excellence and Academic/Comprehen-
sive Commission on Cancer Accredited Cancer programs 
in minority neighborhoods where breast cancer mortality 
rates are highest [7], and breakdowns in the breast can-
cer diagnostic and referral process [17, 18]. The gaps led 
MCBCTF and others to create specific initiatives to address 
differential access to high quality care. A critical initia-
tive was the creation of a metro-wide Breast Cancer Qual-
ity Consortium to engage the institutions to share quality 
data on breast cancer screening and treatment. Gaps in care 
were identified, quality improvements interventions were 
implemented, and improvements were made [11, 19–21].
The issue of racial disparity in breast cancer mortal-
ity was discussed widely in news outlets and commu-
nity meetings [22, 23]. The Chicago Department of Pub-
lic Health made the reduction of racial disparity in breast 
cancer mortality a cornerstone of their Healthy Chicago 
plan [24]. Public policy changes through passage of breast 
cancer disparities reduction legislation were passed (Pub-
lic Law 95-1045 and Public Law 97–0638). In addition to 
these efforts, MCBCTF and others implemented very spe-
cific outreach, education, and patient navigation initiatives 
to address identified deficits and overcome the fragmented 
Chicago healthcare system in particular for minority 
women who are more likely to enter the system through a 
more limited service facility rather than at a comprehensive 
breast center [9, 25].
Even with the notable drop in NHB breast cancer mor-
tality and disparity in Chicago, the NHB to NHW breast 
cancer mortality gaps remain unacceptably large in this 
city and in most of the other nine cities. But public health 
and quality improvement approaches that focus on struc-
tural inequities in health delivery like that of the Metro-
politan Chicago Breast Cancer Taskforce may be a replica-
ble model to address breast cancer disparities in other US 
cities.

Conclusions
What is undeniable is that there is still tremendous variabil-
ity in NHB and NHW breast cancer mortality and disparity 
among the cities in the US with the largest African Ameri-
can populations. The variability in both mortality and 
disparity in the NHB and NHW populations can only be 
explained by social and structural determinants operating at 
the local level. The northeast cities of New York City and 
Philadelphia have had among the fastest decline in NHB 
and NHW mortality rates, while the southern and west-
ern cities of Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, and Memphis 
have had the least progress in disparity reduction. When it 
comes to racial disparity in breast cancer mortality, geogra-
phy appears to dictate destiny. However, the public health 
lesson from Chicago is that these disparities may not be 
inevitable and might be reduced with large city-wide and 
state-wide initiatives, such as those implemented in Illinois 
since 2006 by MCBCTF and its partners.
