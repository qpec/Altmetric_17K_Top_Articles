BACKGROUND: Sports drinks are aggressively marketed to teenagers to replenish fluids and/or 
electrolytes. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, typical adolescent physical 
activity does not require sports drink rehydration. Given US obesity rates and that sugar-
sweetened sports drinks add superfluous calories to the diet, it is important to assess 
adolescent sports drink consumption and changes over time.
METHODS: Researchers in the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey and 2010 National Youth 
Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey collected nationally representative samples of 
US high school students about sports drink consumption. Respondent characteristics 
and health behaviors were examined relative to sports drink consumption by using 
multivariable survey logistic regression. χ2 tests were used to compare the 2 samples  
and examine changes over time.
RESULTS: The 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey and 2010 National Youth Physical Activity 
and Nutrition Survey had national samples of 15 624 and 11 458 respondents, respectively. 
Sports drink consumption in the previous week increased from 56% (2010) to 57.6%  
(2015; P = .0002). However, comparisons of daily sports drink consumption revealed 
reductions for all age groups, sexes, race and/or ethnicity categories, and levels of physical 
activity. The greatest reductions were for non-Hispanic African Americans and for children 
with overweight. Daily sports drink consumption did not decrease for children with obesity 
and increased for children who watched >2 hours per day of television. In 2015, boys, 
non-Hispanic African Americans, Hispanics, and tobacco users exhibited higher odds of 
consuming sports drinks daily.
CONCLUSIONS: Although daily consumption of sports drinks has decreased overall, sugar-
sweetened sports drinks remain popular, with the majority of high school students 
drinking them at least weekly. Of concern, daily consumption increased among teenagers 
watching television >2 hours per day. Pediatricians should counsel adolescents about the 
American Academy of Pediatrics’ recommendations regarding sports drinks.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Sports drinks are 
aggressively marketed to teenagers to replenish fluids and/
or electrolytes. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics 
states that typical adolescent physical activity doesn’t require 
rehydration with sports drinks. Given US obesity rates, there are 
concerns that sugar-sweetened sports drinks add superfluous 
calories to the diet.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Comparison of nationally representative 
samples of US high school students (2010 and 2015) revealed 
increased weekly sports drink consumption, with the majority of 
students drinking at least weekly. Daily consumption increased 
among those watching >2 hours per day of television.

 Sports drinks are electrolyte- and 
carbohydrate-containing soft drinks, 
often flavored and sugar sweetened, 
advertised to restore energy and 
fluids expended in strenuous 
exercise. For elite athletes involved 
in prolonged, physically demanding 
activities, sports drinks may be 
a quick source of carbohydrates, 
water, and electrolyte replacement. 
However, prepubescent youth do 
not lose electrolytes at the same 
rate as adult athletes.1 To this end, 
the American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) has concluded that the average 
child does not partake in a level of 
physical activity that requires the 
electrolyte replenishment offered by 
sports drinks.2
Sports drinks add unnecessary 
calories to children’s diets. Like many 
sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), 
the excessive consumption of sports 
drinks is associated with weight 
gain, dental erosion, obesity, poor 
nutrition, and diabetes.3 
– 
5 A student 
drinking a daily 20 oz serving of a 
sports drink for 1 year can gain up to 
13 additional pounds.6 Furthermore, 
in 2004, Gross et al7 found a 
significant association between the 
consumption of corn syrup found in 
sports drinks and increased risk of 
type 2 diabetes.
Calorie intake from SSBs, such as 
soda, has decreased in the 21st 
century and is partly attributable to 
bans on soda in schools nationwide.8 
Despite efforts to eradicate unhealthy 
beverage options, many schools 
have left sports drinks widely 
available. In a 2015 study of a 
nationally representative population 
of students, researchers found an 
increased consumption of sports 
drinks in students who lived in states 
that banned soda in school but still 
allowed the sale of SSBs in vending 
machines.9 The continued availability 
of sports drinks in schools despite 
their high sugar content is worrisome 
because their popularity has 
dramatically increased. Among 
children ages 6 to 11 years in the 
United States, the average energy 
intake from sports drinks increased 
from 1 to 9 kcal per day from 1989 to 
2008, and the percent who consumed 
sports drinks daily in this age group 
increased sixfold, from 2% to 12%.10 
These findings, although striking 
when published, are likely out of date 
given the advertising and marketing 
by sports drinks manufacturers 
that have been targeted at children 
and adolescents.11 Moreover, with 
our focus on grade-school children, 
we fail to examine consumption 
patterns in adolescents, who likely 
have greater access to sports drinks 
given their autonomy for purchasing 
beverages.
Our primary objective in the current 
study was to analyze and compare 
2 large, nationally representative 
data sets of high school students in 
the United States to identify recent 
changes in sports drink consumption 
over a 5-year time interval. A 
secondary objective was to generate 
updated information regarding 
sociodemographic and lifestyle 
factors associated with sports drink 
consumption by teenagers.
METHODS
Samples and Surveys
Data from the 2010 National Youth 
Physical Activity and Nutrition 
Survey (NYPANS) and the 2015 
Youth Risk and Behavior Survey 
(YRBS) were analyzed. The NYPANS 
was conducted by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) with a primary objective 
of assessing the nutrition-related 
behaviors and physical activity of 
high school students in the United 
States. An explicit secondary 
objective in the NYPANS was to 
provide “data to help improve the 
clarity and strengthen the validity of 
questions on the Youth Risk Behavior 
Survey (YRBS), 
” a biannual national 
survey of high school students in the 
United States in which researchers 
examine a broader array of 
adolescent health risk and protective 
behaviors.12 To that end, in 2015, the 
CDC added questions related to the 
consumption of sports drinks and 
other beverages verbatim from the 
2010 NYPANS to the 2015 YRBS.
Both the NYPANS and YRBS are 
self-administered, paper-and-pencil 
surveys of students in grades 9 to 
12. Both surveys involved a 3-cluster 
sampling design and include students 
in public, Catholic, and private high 
schools in all 50 states and the 
District of Columbia. The data were 
weighted to represent all US high 
school students on the basis of sex, 
race and/or ethnicity, and grade 
and account for nonresponse and 
oversampling of African American 
and Hispanic students.
The variables analyzed in this 
present study were taken directly 
from questions in the 2010 NYPANS 
and the 2015 YRBS; the surveys had 
identical wording for these items. 
Sports drink consumption was 
assessed with the question, “During 
the past 7 days, how many times 
did you drink a can, bottle, or glass 
of a sports drink such as Gatorade 
or PowerAde? (Do not count low-
calorie sports drinks such as Propel 
or G2.)” Students who did not answer 
this question regarding sports drink 
consumption were excluded from 
the analysis. Physical activity was 
assessed with the question, “During 
the past 7 days, on how many days 
were you physically active for a 
total of at least 60 minutes per day? 
(Add up all the time you spent in 
any kind of physical activity that 
increased your heart rate and made 
you breathe hard some of the time.)” 
Sports team participation was 
assessed with the question, “During 
the past 12 months, on how many 
sports teams did you play? (Count 
any teams run by your school or 
community groups.)” Television 
(TV) viewing was assessed with the 
question, “On an average school day, 
how many hours do you watch TV?”

 For the purpose of analysis, high 
school students were categorized 
into 2 groups on the basis of daily 
consumption of sports drinks: 1 or 
more sports drinks per day versus 
fewer.
Both surveys were used to collect 
data on participant age, sex, and race 
and ethnicity (white non-Hispanic, 
African American non-Hispanic, 
Hispanic, and other or multiracial 
non-Hispanic). Self-reported 
weight and height were used to 
calculate BMI and place children 
into categories of underweight or 
normal weight (<85th percentile), 
overweight (≥85th and <95th 
percentile), and obese (≥95th 
percentile). Respondents’ self-
reported physical activity was 
categorized as either being physically 
active for ≥60 minutes per day for 
at least 5 of the previous 7 days 
or for <5 days. TV watching was 
categorized as watching >2 hours per 
day on an average school day versus 
fewer. Sports team participation was 
categorized as “no teams” or “1 or 
more teams.” Current tobacco users 
in the YRBS were defined as high 
school students who reported using 
cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, 
or electronic vapor products on at 
least 1 of the 30 days preceding the 
survey (the NYPANS did not include 
general questions about tobacco use).
Statistical Analysis
SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute, 
Inc, Cary, NC) survey procedures 
and descriptive statistics were 
used to characterize the study 
sample. Respondent characteristics 
and selected health and lifestyle 
behaviors were examined in relation 
to sports drink consumption by 
using multivariable survey logistic 
regression models that included 
age, sex, weight status, physical 
activity, TV watching, and tobacco 
use as covariates. χ2 tests were used 
to compare weighted proportions 
between the NYPANS and YRBS 
samples to examine changes over 
time.
RESULTS
Of the 11 458 NYPANS respondents, 
345 were missing sports drink data, 
leaving 11 113 for analysis. Of the 
15 624 YRBS respondents, 4319 were 
missing sports drink data, leaving 
11 305 for analysis. Table 1 shows the 
demographic composition of the final 
study samples for the 2010 NYPANS 
and the 2015 YRBS. Missing data for 
the question about sports drinks in 
the YRBS were associated with age 
(specifically, younger children were 
more likely to be missing data), race 
(African Americans were more likely 
to be missing data), and physical 
activity (less active children were 
more likely to be missing data) (Rao-
Scott χ2 P all: <.0001); but not sex, 
BMI category, or TV habits. Most 
of the missingness was by design 
because children in 5 of the 54 
primary sampling units in the sample 
were not asked the sports drinks 
questions, and this accounted for 
61% of the missing data.
Sports Drink Consumption 
Comparisons: 2010 NYPANS Versus 
2015 YRBS
Overall, the percentage of high school 
students in the United States who 
consumed any sports drinks in the 
previous week increased from 56.0% 
in 2010, according to the NYPANS 
data, to 57.6% in 2015, according 
to the YRBS data (P = .0002). 
However, the proportion of teenagers 
consuming 1 or more sports drinks 
per day decreased from 16.1% in 
2010 to 13.8% in 2015 (P < .0001). 
No change was noted in the percent 
of youth consuming 4 or more sports 
drinks daily: 3.0% in 2010 and 3.2% 
in 2015 (P = .12).
Comparisons of the 2 data sets 
revealed reductions in the prevalence 
of daily sports drink consumption 
for all age groups, sexes, race and/
or ethnicity categories, and levels 
of physical activity. Although 
no difference in sports drink 
consumption was noted among 
teenagers who did not participate 
in any team sports, a significant 
reduction was noted among those 
who participated in 1 or more 
organized sports. Underweight 
or normal weight and overweight 
children also displayed reductions. 
The greatest reductions were for 
non-Hispanic African American 
children and children with 
overweight. However, children with 
obesity did not exhibit a decrease 
in daily consumption. The percent

 drinks on a daily basis increased 
significantly among those who 
reported watching >2 hours of TV 
daily (Table 2).
2015 YRBS Associations
Overall, 57.6% of high school 
students in 2015 reported consuming 
at least 1 sports drink within the past 
7 days: 31.8% consumed 1 to 3 sports 
drinks, and 11.9% consumed 4 to 6 
sports drinks within the past 7 days. 
Of the students, 13.9% consumed 1 
or more sports drinks daily: 5.5% 
had 1 per day, 3.6% had 2 per day, 
1.6% had 3 per day, and 3.2% had 
4 or more daily. Demographic and 
lifestyle factor correlates with sports 
drink consumption are shown in 
 
Table 3.
When compared with girls, boys 
were almost twice as likely to be 
daily consumers (rather than less 
frequent consumers) of sports drinks 
(adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.97; 
95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.62–
2.41) when adjusting for age, race 
and ethnicity, weight status, physical 
activity, TV watching, and current 
tobacco use. Race and ethnicity also 
had a significant association with 
sports drink consumption. Both 
non-Hispanic African American 
students and Hispanic students were 
more likely than non-Hispanic white 
students to be daily consumers (aOR 
for African American students = 1.74; 
95% CI: 1.40–2.16; aOR for Hispanic 
students = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.06–1.56). 
Tobacco use was moderately 
associated with daily sports drink 
consumption (aOR = 1.90; 95% CI: 
1.61–2.24). Age was not associated 
with the frequency of sports drink 
consumption.
Weight status was not associated 
with sports drink consumption, 
but sports team participation, 
physical activity, and daily hours of 
TV watched were associated with 
sports drinks consumption. High 
school students who participated in 
1 or more sports teams were more 
likely to drink 1 or more sports 
drinks daily (aOR = 1.51; 95% CI: 
1.26–1.82). Interestingly, there was 
no significant interaction between 
weight status and team participation. 
Regardless of the children’s weight 
status, being on sports teams was 
associated with more sports drink 
consumption. Similarly, weight 
status was not associated with sports 
drink consumption regardless of the 
children’s sports team participation.
Students who were categorized 
as physically more active (≥60 
minutes per day on 5 or more of the 
previous 7 days) were also more 
likely to consume sports drinks daily 
compared with those who were 
physically less active (aOR = 1.72; 
95% CI: 1.43–2.07). Relative to high 
school students who watched ≤2 
hours of TV daily, respondents who 
reported watching >2 hours of TV 
per day were more likely to be daily 
consumers (aOR = 1.56; 95% CI: 
1.31–1.87) than lighter consumers.
DISCUSSION
From 2010 to 2015, there was a 
statistically significant increase in 
the proportion of teenagers who 
reported consuming sports drinks 
within the 7 past days; however, 
this increase was small (from 56% 
to 57.6%). It is conceivable that this 
increase in weekly consumption of 
sports drinks may be an unintended 
consequence of recent bans on soda 
in high schools. In an analysis of 
2010 NYPANS data in which sports 
drink consumption with respect to 
access to soda in high schools was

 examined, Taber et al9 found that 
students who had access to vending 
machines in states that banned soda 
within schools drank 1.25 times as 
many servings of sports drink within 
the past week; this association was 
especially strong for non-Hispanic 
African Americans, who consumed 
1.49 servings of sports drink 
compared with 1.21 servings for non-
Hispanic whites.
Although a slightly larger proportion 
of high school students report 
consuming sports drinks at least 
weekly, the proportion of teenagers 
consuming these beverages on 
a daily basis appears to have 
decreased more significantly. Our 
findings are consistent with recent 
findings regarding soda and juice 
consumption by high school students 
in the United States. Using YRBS 
data, the CDC reported a significant 
decrease in the daily consumption of 
nondiet soda (from 33.8% to 20.4%) 
and 100% fruit juice (from 28.6% 
to 21.6%) from 2007 to 2015.13 
These findings collectively reveal 
that teenagers are increasingly 
recognizing that SSBs may be 
consumed occasionally but should 
not be a daily beverage choice.
These reductions in daily 
consumption were observed in 
children across most demographic 
and lifestyle categories, most 
prominently for non-Hispanic 
African Americans and children 
with overweight. However, children 
with obesity and those who watched 
many hours of TV daily did not 
show favorable decreases. This is of 
particular concern given the overall 
increase in the rates of obesity  
among children and adolescents  
and national efforts to combat 
obesity rates by limiting soda 
consumption.4, 
 
14
In terms of physical activity, in a 
2011 report, the AAP’s Committee 
on Nutrition and Council on Sports 
Medicine and Fitness stated that 
the level of physical activity of the 
average child does not require 
the electrolyte replenishment 
offered by sports drinks.2 This 
recommendation may help to 
explain the overall decrease in daily 
sports drinks consumption by high 
school students regardless of level 
of physical activity from 2010 to 
2015 and, more specifically, among 
teenagers who participate on 1 
or more sports teams. Although 
this decrease over time is indeed 
favorable and encouraging, daily 
sports drink consumption is more 
prevalent among teenagers who 
are more athletic or active, which 
reveals that marketing efforts 
continue to have an impact on this 
population.
Although reductions in the daily 
consumption of sports drinks 
were noted for boys and girls 
when comparing the 2 surveys, 
cross-sectional analyses of the 
2015 YRBS data continue to reveal 
substantial differences by sex. In 
fact, in 2015, the proportion of boys 
drinking 1 or more sports drinks 
is now more than double that of 
girls after adjusting for all other 
demographic and clinical variables 
(18.7% vs 8.8%). The reasons for 
this substantial difference are 
unclear. For example, although these 
sex-specific findings are adjusted 
for sports team participation and 
TV watching, the survey data do

 not include information regarding 
how much of the TV viewing is of 
sporting events, and thus teenagers’ 
exposure to sports drink marketing. 
Furthermore, there is likely some 
inherent sex bias with respect 
to the marketing campaigns for 
sports drinks; this is not only the 
case for male-predominant sports, 
such as football and ice hockey, 
but likely also true for sports such 
as basketball and soccer, in which 
despite considerable advances in 
the development of professional 
women’s leagues, the men’s leagues 
are still more likely to be broadcast 
at prime time and have greater 
viewership.
Cross-sectional analyses also reveal 
that non-Hispanic African American 
children continue to have the 
highest prevalence of daily sports 
drink consumption among the 
race and ethnicity groups studied. 
Interestingly, although combustible 
tobacco use has consistently been 
shown to be less prevalent among 
high school students who participate 
on sports teams, 
15 daily sports drink 
consumption was almost twice as 
prevalent among teenagers who 
used tobacco after controlling for 
other demographic and lifestyle 
factors.
Whereas proper hydration is 
extremely important, calorie-
laden flavored sports drinks have 
the potential to contribute to the 
epidemic of childhood obesity. 
The racial disparities with respect 
to sports drink consumption are 
also cause for concern. The higher 
prevalence of daily sports drink 
consumption in 2015 among 
Hispanics and non-Hispanic 
African Americans, when compared 
with non-Hispanic whites and 
even after accounting for other 
confounding variables, mirrors the 
heightened obesity rates among 
non-Hispanic African American 
and Hispanic populations. This 
finding may be confounded by other 
sociodemographic factors16 that 
could not be accounted for in the 
current analyses because they were 
not measured in the surveys.
The association between daily 
consumption of sports drinks and 
high levels of daily TV viewing, 
when physical activity level and 
other demographic variables 
are controlled for, is worrisome. 
TV advertisements and product 
endorsements may be partly to 
blame. In its 2011 clinical report, 
the AAP’s Committee on Nutrition 
and Council on Sports Medicine and 
Fitness2 expressed concern about 
the health consequences of frequent 
or excessive consumption of sports 
drinks (ie, overweight or obesity 
and demineralization of dental 
enamel); nonetheless, sports drinks 
are still aggressively marketed to 
children and adolescents. In 2010, 
Gatorade rebranded itself in an 
effort to expand its appeal to a larger 
demographic. The company targeted 
13- to 17-year-old athletes and 
expanded its definition of “athletes” 
to attract a larger consumer base.17 
The brand also continues to partner 
with many athletes, teams, leagues, 
and events that receive significant 
media attention and screen time; 
some notable examples include 
Serena Williams, Michael Jordan, 
Ironman, and the National Football 
League.18, 
 
19 This aggressive 
marketing campaign gives little 
consideration to the actual level of 
physical activity that necessitates 
electrolyte replenishment, focusing 
instead on the popularity and 
athleticism of its spokespeople.20 
Our finding that teenagers who 
watched >2 hours of TV daily were 
much more likely to consume sports 
drinks daily is consistent with 
marketing research; studies have 
revealed that TV advertisements that 
promote recognizable food brands 
are associated with an increased 
consumption of these foods.21, 
 
22
This study has several methodologic 
strengths. The YRBS and NYPANS 
data sets are large, nationally 
representative samples collected by 
the CDC that have been shown to be 
reliable regarding the prevalence 
of behaviors of high school 
students in the United States.23 
Both data sets provided samples 
that were large enough to allow 
for regression analyses that could 
be controlled for demographic and 
other lifestyle variables. In terms 
of limitations, some of the YRBS’s 
primary sampling units did not ask 
about sports drink consumption, 
and thus resulted in missing data; 
nonetheless, complete YRBS data 
were available for >11 000 high 
school students nationwide. To 
the extent that the YRBS does not 
capture information regarding the 
type of TV programming viewed, 
it was impossible to investigate 
associations between specific TV 
program content and sports drink 
consumption.
Pediatricians should educate 
parents and teenagers about the 
seductive marketing of sports drinks 
to children: identifying the “health 
halo” that surrounds sports drinks 
despite the hidden sugar and calorie 
content that lie within. As per 
AAP recommendations, clinicians 
should encourage rehydration 
with water for most sports-related 
activities; rehydration with 
sports drinks should be limited to 
instances when there is “a need 
for more rapid replenishment of 
carbohydrates and/or electrolytes 
in combination with water during 
periods of prolonged, vigorous 
sports participation or other intense 
physical activity.”

CONCLUSIONS
The prevalence of sports drink 
consumption among high school 
students in the United States 
increased slightly between 2010 and 
2015. The 2015 YRBS data reveal 
once again that boys, Hispanics, and 
non-Hispanic African Americans

 are more likely to consume sports 
drinks. Adolescents with higher 
levels of physical activity were more 
likely to consume sports drinks 
daily compared with teenagers 
who were less physically active. 
Of concern, children watching >2 
hours of TV daily were also more 
likely to consume sports drinks 
daily, a worrisome reflection of the 
association between TV viewing, 
commercial advertisements, and 
obesity. Whereas soda intake has 
decreased, likely in part because 
of a national campaign to reduce 
the consumption of this sugary 
beverage, sports drinks receive 
relatively little condemnation 
because of their perceived 
healthfulness and association  
with elite athletes and role 
models. The AAP consistently 
states that water is the 
better choice for rehydration 
purposes and that children and 
adolescents generally do not 
need supplemental electrolyte 
replacement. Pediatricians should 
discuss the AAP’s rehydration 
recommendations with patients and 
parents with the goal of limiting 
sports drink consumption.
