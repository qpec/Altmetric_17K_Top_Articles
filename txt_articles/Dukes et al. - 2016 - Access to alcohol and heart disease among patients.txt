ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To investigate the relation between alcohol 
consumption and heart disease by using differences in 
county level alcohol sales laws as a natural 
experiment.
Design
Observational cohort study using differences in 
alcohol sales laws.
setting
Hospital based healthcare encounters in Texas, USA.
POPulatiOn
1 106 968 patients aged 21 or older who were residents 
of “wet” (no alcohol restrictions) and “dry” (complete 
prohibition of alcohol sales) counties and admitted to 
hospital between 2005 and 2010, identified using the 
Texas Inpatient Research Data File.
OutCOme measures
 Prevalent and incident alcohol misuse and alcoholic 
liver disease were used for validation analyses. The 
main cardiovascular outcomes were atrial fibrillation, 
acute myocardial infarction, and congestive heart 
failure.
results
Residents of wet counties had a greater prevalence 
and incidence of alcohol misuse and alcoholic liver 
disease. After multivariable adjustment, wet county 
residents had a greater prevalence (odds ratio 1.05, 
95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.09; P=0.007) and 
incidence (hazard ratio 1.07, 1.01 to 1.13; P=0.014) of 
atrial fibrillation, a lower prevalence (odds ratio 0.83, 
0.79 to 0.87; P<0.001) and incidence (hazard ratio 
0.91, 0.87 to 0.99; P=0.019) of myocardial infarction, 
and a lower prevalence (odds ratio 0.87, 0.84 to 0.90; 
P<0.001) of congestive heart failure. Conversion of 
counties from dry to wet resulted in statistically 
significantly higher rates of alcohol misuse, alcoholic 
liver disease, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart 
failure, with no detectable difference in myocardial 
infarction.
COnClusiOns
Greater access to alcohol was associated with more 
atrial fibrillation and less myocardial infarction and 
congestive heart failure, although an increased risk of 
congestive heart failure was seen shortly after alcohol 
sales were liberalized.
Introduction
Alcohol is the most widely consumed drug in the United 
States.1 After the end of Prohibition, multiple states 
enacted laws permitting counties and local municipali-
ties to place restrictions on the sale of alcohol. The most 
populous state to enact such laws was Texas, where 
“local option” laws have created a patchwork of counties 
where alcohol sales are unrestricted (“wet” counties), 
partially restricted, or completely prohibited (“dry” 
counties). The health effects of such laws have not been 
previously studied.
Heart disease remains the most common cause of 
death in the world.2  Alcohol may be an important deter-
minant of heart disease, but the evidence is complex 
and often conflicting. Although the available evidence 
suggests that alcohol may increase the risk of atrial 
fibrillation3-7 and reduce the risk of myocardial infarc-
tion,8-11 the data remain inconsistent.3-15 These results 
rely almost entirely on self reported alcohol use. Given 
the inaccuracies inherent to such ascertainment,16 17 
misclassification of alcohol consumption may be an 
important problem that is challenging to overcome. In 
the absence of a controlled clinical trial, this primary 
predictor (alcohol consumption) is determined by the 
choice of each individual in all population based studies 
that have been described, setting the stage for substan-
tial confounding that even the most comprehensive 
multivariable adjustment may be inadequate to over-
come. As access to alcohol in residents of wet compared 
with dry counties is essentially assigned, we sought to 
use that assignment as a natural experiment. A partic-
ularly unique opportunity arises from counties that

have converted from dry to wet, providing a comparison 
(the change in access to alcohol) within the same popu-
lation that should minimize effects from both measured 
and unmeasured confounders. We therefore sought to 
investigate the relation between alcohol sales laws and 
hospital admissions for common cardiac diseases.
Methods
Information on the alcohol sales laws and local option 
election results for all counties in the state of Texas 
from 2005 and 2010 came from the Texas Alcoholic Bev-
erage Commission. We also obtained all county-wide 
and municipal local option election records from 1937 
to 2010 from the same source and reviewed them to val-
idate a county’s alcohol sales status. We defined a dry 
county as a county that prohibited all alcohol sales in 
all locations in the county throughout the follow-up 
time period and a wet county as one that had no 
 
prohibition on alcohol sales over the course of the fol-
low-up period. We did two analyses. Firstly, we did a 
double cohort analysis wherein we compared cross sec-
tional and longitudinal patient level outcomes among 
patients residing in wet versus dry counties, excluding 
patients residing in counties with partial restrictions on 
alcohol sales or where alcohol laws had changed during 
the study period. We used a double cohort design to 
longitudinally examine outcomes among two groups, 
each selected on the basis of the primary predictor (in 
this case, the presence versus absence of alcohol sales 
laws restrictions). Secondly, we did longitudinal analy-
ses of a cohort of residents in counties that changed 
alcohol sales laws during the study period by compar-
ing outcomes before and after the conversion.
We obtained county level median income by using 
the 2010 census data from the United States Census 
Bureau (http://quickfacts.census.gov). County hospital 
bed counts came from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health-
care (http://www.dartmouthatlas.org).
We used the Texas Inpatient Research Data File 
obtained from the Texas Department of State Health 
Services (Austin, TX) to identify all patients older than 
21 years admitted to a hospital in the state of Texas 
between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2009 
(n=4 832 460). We linked individual databases for each 
calendar year by using an encrypted linkage variable 
specific to each patient, allowing for longitudinal fol-
low-up of an individual over time. We excluded 
patients with missing admission date, county of resi-
dence, age, sex, race, or ethnicity data or residence 
outside of the state of Texas (n=195 741). Patients were 
entered into the study cohort at the time of their first 
admission and followed until 31 December 2009 for 
diagnosis of the outcome of interest or censoring at the 
time of inpatient death.
The admitting institution recorded age, sex, race, 
ethnicity, and county of residence at each healthcare 
encounter. We defined patients’ county of residence at 
the time of their first hospital admission. Up to 24 ICD-9 
(international classification of diseases, 9th revision) 
codes were provided for each encounter to identify out-
comes of interest and relevant covariates (supplementary 
table A). Dichotomous medical comorbidities were 
accumulated at each healthcare encounter and carried 
forward over time. We did a proof of concept analysis 
using alcohol misuse and alcoholic liver disease as out-
comes. The primary heart disease outcomes of interest 
were atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, and 
congestive heart failure. As postoperative atrial fibrilla-
tion may have a different underlying mechanism than 
atrial fibrillation occurring outside of the acute surgical 
setting, we did not include diagnoses of atrial fibrilla-
tion in the analysis if the patient had undergone cardio-
thoracic surgery during the same hospital admission or 
within the previous 30 days. For the analyses of preva-
lent diseases, we used only ICD-9 codes present at the 
time of the first hospital admission. In analyses of inci-
dent disease, we excluded patients with the outcome of 
interest at the time of their first hospital admission.
Patient involvement
This research used de-identified patient data. No 
patients were involved in setting the research question 
or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for the design or implementation of 
the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpre-
tation or writing up of results. There are no plans to dis-
seminate the results of the research to study participants 
or the relevant patient community.
statistical analysis
Continuous variables with a normal distribution are 
presented as means and standard deviations and were 
compared using Student’s t test. Non-normally distrib-
uted continuous variables are presented as medians 
with interquartile ranges and were compared using 
Kruskal-Wallis tests. Associations between categorical 
variables were assessed using χ2 tests.
We used logistic regression for multivariable analy-
ses of dichotomous outcomes. We estimated differences 
in the cumulative incidence of each outcome by using a 
Fine Gray competing risks model,18 with in-hospital 
death treated as a competing risk. We used Cox propor-
tional hazards models to investigate incident outcomes 
after multivariable adjustment. Patients who had more 
than one outcome, such as atrial fibrillation, then myo-
cardial infarction, then congestive heart failure, would 
remain in the model until the outcome of interest 
occurred; the relevant comorbidities (such as atrial 
fibrillation or myocardial infarction before congestive 
heart failure) were included accordingly as time 
updated covariates. We tested hazard proportionality 
assumptions graphically using smoothed scaled 
Schoenfeld estimates, which showed no violation of the 
proportional hazard assumption. All analyses were 
controlled for potential confounders identified a priori 
that were available in the administrative dataset and 
selected on the basis of biological plausibility and con-
vention determined by previous literature.
Owing to significant differences in the baseline covari-
ates between the wet and dry counties, we also did pro-
pensity adjusted and sensitivity analyses. We used 
propensity score methods to estimate adjusted relative

hazards for the association of baseline county wet-dry 
status with alcohol misuse, alcoholic liver disease, atrial 
fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, and congestive 
heart failure by using the multivariable adjusted Cox 
models. The Cox models were then adjusted for the tenth 
of the propensity score. Selection of covariates for inte-
gration into these propensity scores was based on pub-
lished recommendations to include all available 
potential confounders identified a priori while avoiding 
inclusion of mediators or colliders and erring on the side 
of inclusion when potential confounders were known to 
be particularly important to the outcome (as opposed to 
only the predictor) relevant to the analysis of interest.19 
20 
 
The specific covariates included for each outcome are 
listed in supplementary table B. We evaluated the mod-
els used to estimate the propensity scores by plotting the 
observed versus expected percentages living in wet 
counties (supplementary figure). Visual inspection of 
these plots showed acceptable calibration. Given known 
differences in cardiovascular outcomes by race, ethnic-
ity, and sex,7 
21 we did sensitivity analyses by restricting 
the cohorts to non-Hispanic white men.
To compare rates of admission for heart disease 
before and after changes in alcohol sales laws, we used 
logistic models to compare disease prevalence in the 
two periods among admitted residents of the counties 
that changed wet/dry status. We also did county level 
ecologic analyses, in which we calculated population 
based admission rates by using the population of the 
each county. We then used Poisson models to estimate 
and compare adjusted admission rates.
We used Stata 12 for all analyses. We considered a 
two tailed P value less than 0.05 to be statistically 
 
significant.
Results
Twenty nine counties were identified as dry, 47 coun-
ties were wet, and seven counties changed from dry to 
wet. After applying exclusion criteria, we identified 
4 662 123 patients aged 21 or older who were admitted 
to hospital in the state of Texas between 1 January 
2005 and 31 December 2009. The dry counties had pro-
hibited alcohol sales since Prohibition, and the most 
recent year that any of the wet counties had been dry 
was 1959.
Patient level analyses in wet versus dry counties
Among 1 046 759 wet county residents with at least one 
hospital admission, a total of 2 388 700 admissions 
occurred. In dry counties, 60 209 residents were admit-
ted to hospital, resulting in 139 192 admissions. Table 1 
 
shows the baseline characteristics of these patients. 
Table 2 shows the crude (unadjusted) prevalence and 
incidence of each outcome, as well as the same sum-
mary statistics restricted to non-Hispanic white men, in 
wet and dry counties.
Differences in alcohol misuse and alcoholic liver 
disease as proof of concept
After adjustment for age, race, ethnicity, and sex, the 
prevalence of alcohol misuse was significantly greater 
among residents of wet counties than in dry counties 
(fig 1 ). Also after multivariable adjustment, we found a 
36% greater risk of incident alcohol misuse among 
admitted residents of wet counties than in dry counties 
(hazard ratio 1.36, 1.23 to 1.50; P<0.001). After adjust-
ment for the same covariates, prevalent alcoholic liver 
disease was also more common in admitted wet county 
residents (fig 1). Similarly, incident alcoholic liver dis-
ease was higher among patients residing in wet coun-
ties, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.81 (1.51 to 2.16; 
P<0.001).
Cardiovascular diagnoses
Atrial fibrillation was significantly more prevalent 
among wet county residents after adjustment for age,

race, ethnicity, sex, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, 
tobacco abuse, congestive heart failure, coronary artery 
disease, lung disease, and valvular disease (fig 1). 
 
Similarly, wet counties residents had a significantly 
greater adjusted incidence of atrial fibrillation than did 
patients residing in dry counties (hazard ratio 1.07
, 1.01 
to 1.13; P=0.014).
After adjustment for age, race, ethnicity, sex, dia-
betes, hypertension, obesity, and tobacco use, wet 
county resident status was associated with a signifi-
cantly lower odds of acute myocardial infarction on 
the first hospital admission observed (fig 1 ). Resi-
dents of wet counties also had a significantly lower 
risk of incident acute myocardial infarction (adjusted 
hazard ratio 0.91, 0.87 to 0.99; P=0.019). After multi-
variable adjustment for age, race, ethnicity, sex, dia-
betes, hypertension, obesity, tobacco use, acute 
myocardial infarction, and coronary artery disease, 
wet county residents had a significantly lower odds 
of prevalent congestive heart failure (fig 1). After 
adjustment for the same potential cofounders, wet 
country residents had a decreased risk of incident 
congestive heart failure that did not meet statistical 
significance (adjusted hazard ratio 0.98, 0.94 to 1.03; 
P=0.431).
Propensity analyses
The propensity adjusted analyses showed no meaning-
ful differences in prevalent disease compared with the 
conventional multivariable adjusted analyses (fig 1 ). In 
the incidence analyses, only one meaningful difference 
was observed: with propensity adjustment, the associ-
ation of wet county status with incident congestive 
heart failure maintained the same point estimate 
 
hazard ratio but became statistically significant (0.96, 
0.91 to 1.00; P=0.045). Figure 2 shows the propensity 
adjusted cumulative incidence curves.
Conversion of county status
During the five years of observation, no counties con-
verted from wet to dry. However, seven dry counties 
passed countywide referendums lifting restrictions 
on alcohol sales. The total number of hospital admis-
sions before and after the referendums in those coun-
ties were 43 559 and 42 734 over a median duration of 
15 (interquartile range 7-22) months before and 15 
(8-25) months after the law change. The post-conver-
sion interval (from dry to wet county status) was asso-
ciated with a greater odds of alcohol misuse (odds 
ratio 1.31, 1.19 to 1.43; P<0.001), alcoholic liver dis-
ease (1.61, 1.35 to 1.91; P<0.001), atrial fibrillation 
(1.07, 1.03 to 1.12; P=0.001), and congestive heart fail-
ure (1.07, 1.04 to 1.11; P<0.001) among patients admit-
ted to hospital; we found no difference in acute 
myocardial infarction (odds ratio 0.99, 0.91 to 1.07; 
P=0.746). In an ecological analysis using the popula-
tion of the counties as the denominator, we observed 
a higher incidence of alcohol misuse, alcoholic liver 
disease, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart fail-
ure admissions per 1000 person years after the lifting 
of alcohol sale restrictions, whereas myocardial 
infarction showed no meaningful change (fig 3). Note 
that the incidence differences shown reflect the dif-
ference between the before and after referendum 
rates for a given outcome.

discussion
Among all patients admitted to hospital in Texas from 
2005 to 2010, those residing in a county without alcohol 
sales restrictions had a higher prevalence and inci-
dence of alcohol misuse, alcoholic liver disease, and 
atrial fibrillation; a lower prevalence and incidence of 
acute myocardial infarction; and a lower prevalence 
and incidence of congestive heart failure. Over the same 
five years, conversion of counties from restrictive to 
open alcohol laws resulted in increased rates of alcohol 
misuse, alcoholic liver disease, atrial fibrillation, and 
congestive heart failure.
Comparison with other studies
Previous studies examining the associations between 
alcohol and heart disease have been limited by two 
major factors. Firstly, they have generally relied on 
self report, which is not necessarily reliable.16 17 
 
Secondly, alcohol consumption among research par-
ticipants is primarily based on each individual’s dis-
cretion. This makes extricating the associations 
between alcohol consumption and other related 
behaviors, decisions, and exposures that may serve 
as important confounders difficult if not impossible. 
Our approach eliminates concerns about the accu-
racy of self reported alcohol consumption. This 
allows our alternative research approach to comple-
ment and add clarity to the previous survey based 
studies. Most importantly, the before versus after 
intra-county analyses provide outcome data in the 
same population with and without restriction of alco-
hol sales, delivering a particularly potent approach 
to minimize confounding. The validity of the use of 
dry and wet county status as a marker for alcohol use 
was shown by our alcohol misuse and alcoholic liver 
disease analyses.

Although most population based studies have sug-
gested that increased alcohol consumption is associ-
ated with a higher risk of incident atrial fibrillation,5 
6 
22 
23 
 
not all reports have identified a significant associa-
tion.3 4 7  In this study, wet county residents had more 
atrial fibrillation, whether analyzed as a prevalent or 
incident outcome. Atrial fibrillation was the only out-
come that showed divergent results between the unad-
justed numbers and the adjusted results in the 
intra-county analyses. Such results were in fact 
expected owing to two important considerations: firstly, 
dry county residents were older and more often male 
and non-Hispanic white, all particularly important risk 
factors for atrial fibrillation;7 21 secondly, owing to the 
inverse relations between county status and myocardial 
infarction and congestive heart failure, some “negative 
confounding” (sometimes termed “suppression”) was 
likely, which, once accounted for, uncovered wet 
county status as a risk factor for atrial fibrillation. Pro-
pensity based analyses also showed that atrial fibrilla-
tion was more common in wet counties. As this 
database tracked patients on their county of residence, 
and not by the location of the admitting hospital, these 
findings are unlikely to be explained by rural versus 
urban hospital referral patterns. These findings are fur-
ther supported by our more robust intra-county before 
and after election analysis, which showed an increase 
in admissions for atrial fibrillation after the liberaliza-
tion of drinking laws.
Although previous data generally favor a protective 
effect of alcohol on the risk of myocardial infarction,10 
11 
 
results from conventional epidemiologic studies have 
been conflicting.11- 13 24- 26  Previous studies have used 
per capita alcohol consumption and population based 
outcomes to understand the relation between alcohol 
and cardiovascular health.24-27  Interestingly, the most 
consistent message is that more per capita alcohol con-
sumption is associated with an increased mortality 
among patients with ischemic heart disease.25-27  How-
ever, none of these studies focused on incident myocar-
dial infarction, heart failure, or atrial fibrillation. In 
our study, patients residing in wet counties had a lower 
risk of myocardial infarction. In contrast, no significant 
changes in admissions for myocardial infarction were 
observed after a change in alcohol sales laws within 
the same counties. Although this may suggest that 
some residual confounding in the wet versus dry 
county analyses remains, it may be that the chronic 
beneficial effects of alcohol had inadequate time to 
confer any demonstrable protection against myocar-
dial infarction with changes in alcohol access over a 
relatively short timeframe. Most of the beneficial effects 
on coronary artery disease are thought to be chronic, 
including influencing pathways related to cholesterol 
transport, insulin sensitivity, abdominal obesity, and 
oxidative stress.28
The relation between heart failure and alcohol use 
has been one of the more complex associations to elu-
cidate. On the one hand, alcohol is known to cause car-
diomyopathy.29 30  On the other hand, some studies 
have suggested that alcohol may have a protective 
effect when consumed in moderation.14 15  Both atrial 
fibrillation and myocardial infarction can lead to heart 
failure,31 32  with myocardial infarction likely being 
much the more important of the two. As with myocar-
dial infarction, wet county residents had significantly 
less prevalent congestive heart failure. In addition, the 
propensity based analysis showed a decreased inci-
dence of congestive heart failure in wet county resi-
dents. After referendums to liberalize alcohol sales in 
the intra-county analyses, incidence of congestive 
heart failure increased. Once again, although we can-
not exclude residual confounding in the between 
county analyses as an explanation for these disparate 
results, it may be that the acute effects of alcohol 
(known to result in negative inotropy33 34) trump the 
beneficial chronic effects (such as via reduction in 
myocardial infarction) during this switch in access to 
alcohol over only one to two years. In contrast, the 
alcohol laws were stable for decades preceding the 
study timeframe of the between county analyses, 
which may have resulted in lower rates of myocardial 
infarction (through chronic protective effects against 
coronary artery disease) and thus lower overall rates of 
congestive heart failure in chronically wet versus 
chronically dry counties.
The discordant results, showing more atrial fibrilla-
tion but less myocardial infarction and congestive heart 
failure in wet compared with dry counties, are particu-
larly remarkable given that these outcomes generally 
share all of the same risk factors and that each can lead 
to the other. Specifically, atrial fibrillation predicts myo-
cardial infarction and congestive heart failure,31- 
37 just 
as myocardial infarction predicts atrial fibrillation7 
38 
39 
 
and congestive heart failure predicts atrial fibrilla-
tion.7 
31 Therefore, given these potential “downstream” 
influences, these discordant results may suggest that

the direct effects of alcohol are more potent than the 
point estimates reported.
strengths and limitations of study
Although this is the largest study of alcohol use and 
heart disease and the first to use differences in alcohol 
sales laws as a predictor of disease, we must acknowl-
edge several limitations. As alcohol laws in the state of 
Texas limit only the sale of alcohol in a municipality 
and not its transport or consumption, misclassification 
of the exposure in the form of alcohol consumption in 
dry counties is possible. This misclassification could 
have attenuated the observed effects. We cannot 
exclude the possibility that patterns of practice in one 
country differed (such as having a lower threshold to 
admit to hospital for cardiovascular disease), but our 
discordant findings between the atrial fibrillation and 
the myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure 
results strongly suggest that no systematic difference in 
referral patterns for hospital admission existed. The 
Texas Inpatient Research Data File is an administrative 
database that is derived from physicians’ admission 
and discharge coding. Although we were not able to val-
idate physicians’ coding for an individual patient (all 
data are de-identified), our predictor (access to alcohol) 
did not rely on physicians’ coding and differences in 
alcohol misuse and alcoholic liver disease validated our 
assumptions. Most acute myocardial infarctions that 
come to medical attention likely result in a hospital 
admission, but we would have failed to capture out of 
hospital fatal myocardial infarctions and episodes of 
atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure treated in 
emergency departments or outpatient clinics. As men-
tioned throughout the manuscript, residual confound-
ing as an explanation for our results is an important 
consideration. Some potentially important covariates, 
such as individual alcohol exposure, county level per 
capita alcohol use, dietary habits, physical activity, and 
disease severity, were not available in this dataset. 
However, most of our results persisted after both multi-
variable adjustment and propensity analyses, as well as 
in the robust change analyses within the same counties. 
Finally, we acknowledge that these observational data 
are insufficient to prove any causal relations.
Dry counties were on average less wealthy (supple-
mentary table C). Although differences in socioeco-
nomic status might explain some of the results 
observed, individual level measures of income or edu-
cation were not available in this dataset. We did not 
adjust for county level income in the between county 
analyses owing to collinearity with the primary predic-
tor. Importantly, it would seem to be unlikely that differ-
ences in socioeconomic status could explain discordant 
results on the relation between alcohol and atrial fibril-
lation compared with the myocardial infarction and 
congestive heart failure outcomes (that is, more atrial 
fibrillation in wet counties, yet less myocardial infarc-
tion and congestive heart failure), and our previous 
publication using similar data from California and geo-
graphic location as a surrogate of socioeconomic status 
failed to show an association between location and 
atrial fibrillation after adjustment for race.21 Finally, this 
once again likely points to the superior reliability of the 
within county analyses, in which such factors would be 
expected to remain constant in a given county.
Dry counties also on average had fewer hospital beds. 
However, the location of the participants was based on 
their county of residence rather than where they sought 
medical care, and access to inpatient facilities would be 
determined primarily by insurance status and referral 
patterns of primary care physicians rather than county 
of residence. We also cannot take proximity of a hospi-
tal across county lines into account. Once again, it 
would seem unlikely that access to hospitals explained 
our discordant results (as more access in general would 
be expected to be associated with more of each diagno-
sis rather than more of some and less of others). Finally, 
the number of hospital beds in a particular county 
should not influence the within county analyses. Taken 
together, however, clear differences exist in the charac-
teristics of dry versus wet counties, and we cannot 
exclude the possibility that some unmeasured con-
founder(s) apart from the alcohol access laws may 
explain the between county results. This is in part why 
our validation analyses, showing more alcohol misuse 
and more alcoholic liver disease in wet than dry coun-
ties, may be especially important in showing true differ-
ences in alcohol consumption between counties.
Conclusions and policy implications
We have shown, for the first time, that laws limiting 
alcohol sales have measurable public health effects. 
Increased access to alcohol was consistently associated 
with more atrial fibrillation and less myocardial infarc-
tion. Given that this investigation of the most commonly 
consumed drug (alcohol) and the leading cause of 
death (heart disease) leverages a natural experiment to 
minimize confounding, we believe that our results have 
broadly applicable health implications relevant to peo-
ple with and at risk for various types of cardiovascular 
disease. More broadly, this research shows that public 
laws limiting access to a commonly consumed sub-
stance have important health effects that may be both 
beneficial and harmful.
