The importance of breastfeeding in low-income and middle-income countries is well recognised, but less consensus 
exists about its importance in high-income countries. In low-income and middle-income countries, only 37% of 
children younger than 6 months of age are exclusively breastfed. With few exceptions, breastfeeding duration is 
shorter in high-income countries than in those that are resource-poor. Our meta-analyses indicate protection against 
child infections and malocclusion, increases in intelligence, and probable reductions in overweight and diabetes. We 
did not fi
 nd associations with allergic disorders such as asthma or with blood pressure or cholesterol, and we noted 
an increase in tooth decay with longer periods of breastfeeding. For nursing women, breastfeeding gave protection 
against breast cancer and it improved birth spacing, and it might also protect against ovarian cancer and type 2 
diabetes. The scaling up of breastfeeding to a near universal level could prevent 823 000 annual deaths in children 
younger than 5 years and 20 000 annual deaths from breast cancer. Recent epidemiological and biological fi
 ndings 
from during the past decade expand on the known benefi
 ts of breastfeeding for women and children, whether they 
are rich or poor.
Introduction
“In all mammalian species the reproductive cycle 
comprises both pregnancy and breast-feeding: in the 
absence of latter, none of these species, man included, 
could have survived”, wrote paediatrician Bo Vahlquist in 
1981.1 3 years earlier, Derek and Patrice Jelliff
 e in their 
classic book Breast Milk in the Modern World2 stated that 
“breast-feeding is a matter of concern in both industrialised 
and developing countries because it has such a wide range 
of often underappreciated consequences”.3 The Jelliff
 es 
anticipated that breastfeeding would be relevant to 
“present-day interest in the consequences of infant 
nutrition on subsequent adult health”.3 These statements 
were challenged by the American Academy of Pediatrics, 
which in its 1984 report on the scientifi
 c evidence for 
breastfeeding stated that “if there are benefi
 ts associated 
with breast-feeding in populations with good sanitation, 
nutrition and medical care, the benefi
 ts are apparently 
modest”.4
In the past three decades, the evidence behind 
breastfeeding recommendations has evolved markedly 
(appendix p 3). Results from epidemiological studies and 
growing knowledge of the roles of epigenetics, stem 
cells, and the developmental origins of health and disease 
lend strong support to the ideas proposed by Vahlquist 
and the Jelliff
 es. Never before in the history of science 
has so much been known about the complex importance 
of breastfeeding for both mothers and children.
Here, in the fi
 rst of two Series papers, we describe 
present patterns and past trends in breastfeeding 
throughout the world, review the short-term and long-
term health consequences of breastfeeding for the child 
and mother, estimate potential lives saved by scaling up 
breastfeeding, and summarise insights into how 
breastfeeding might permanently shape individuals’ life 
course. The second paper in the Series5 covers the 
determinants of breastfeeding and the eff
 ectiveness of 
promotion interventions. It discusses the role of breast-
feeding in HIV transmission and how knowledge about 
this issue has evolved in the past two decades, and 
examines the lucrative market of breastmilk substitutes, 
the environmental role of breastfeeding, and its economic 
implications. In the context of the post-2015 development 
agenda, the two articles document how essential 
breastfeeding is for building a better world for future 
generations in all countries, rich and poor alike.

Search strategy and selection criteria
We obtained information about the associations between 
breastfeeding and outcomes in children or mothers from 
28 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, of which 22 were 
commissioned for this review. See appendix pp 23–30 for the 
databases searched and search terms used. We reviewed the 
following disorders for young children: child mortality; 
diarrhoea incidence and admission to hospital; lower 
respiratory tract infections incidence, prevalence, and 
admission to hospital; acute otitis media; eczema; food 
allergies; allergic rhinitis; asthma or wheezing; infant growth 
(length, weight, body-mass index); dental caries; and 
malocclusion. For older children, adolescents, and adults, we 
did systematic reviews for systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure; overweight and obesity; total cholesterol; type 2 
diabetes; and intelligence. For mothers, we did systematic 
reviews covering the following outcomes: lactational 
amenorrhoea; breast and ovarian cancer; type 2 diabetes; 
post-partum weight change; and osteoporosis.

Breastfeeding indicators and data sources for this 
review
WHO has defi
 ned the following indicators for the study of 
feeding practices of infants and young children:6 early 
initiation of breastfeeding (proportion of children born in 
the past 24 months who were put to the breast within an 
hour of birth); exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months 
(proportion of infants aged 0–5 months who are fed 
exclusively with breastmilk. This indicator is based on the 
diets of infants younger than 6 months during the 24 h 
before the survey [to avoid recall bias], not on the proportion 
who are exclusively breastfed for the full 6-month period); 
continued breastfeeding at 1 year (proportion of children 
aged 12–15 months who are fed breastmilk); and continued 
breastfeeding at 2 years (proportion of children aged 
20–23 months who are fed breastmilk).
Because few high-income countries report on the 
aforementioned indicators, we calculated additional 
indicators to allow global comparisons: ever breastfed 
(infants reported to have been breastfed, even if for a 
short period); breastfed at 6 months (in high-income 
countries, the proportion of infants who were breastfed 
from birth to 6 months or older; in low-income and 
middle-income countries [LMICs] with standardised 
surveys, the proportion of infants aged 4–7 months 
[median age of 6 months] who are breastfed); and 
breastfed at 12 months (in high-income countries, the 
proportion of children breastfed for 12 months or longer; 
in LMICs, the proportion of children aged 10–13 months 
[median age of 12 months] who are breastfed).
For this review, we used the last three, additional 
indicators for comparisons between high-income countries 
and LMICs only. Otherwise, we reported on the standard 
international indicators (appendix p 4).
For LMICs, we reanalysed national surveys done since 
1993, including Demographic and Health Surveys, 
Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, and others (appendix 
pp 5–12). Nearly all surveys had response rates higher 
than 90% and used standardised questionnaires 
and indicators.
For all high-income countries with 50 000 or more 
annual births, we did systematic reviews of published 
studies and the grey literature and contacted local 
researchers or public health practitioners when data 
from a particular country were not available or when 
there was ambiguity (appendix pp 13–17). Information 
about breastfeeding from national samples was not 
available from many countries. Although 27 out of 
35 countries had some information about breastfeeding 
at a national level, response rates were often in the 
50–70% range, indicators were rarely standardised, and 
recall periods tended to be long. We used administrative 
or other data when surveys were not available. If 
necessary, we estimated the proportion of infants 
breastfed at 12 months on the basis of information 
available for breastfeeding at 6 months and vice versa. 
We calculated time trends using multilevel linear 
regression models (hierarchical mixed models) that take 
into account that two or more surveys were included in 
the analyses for each country. We explored departures 
from linearity with fractional polynomial regression 
models.7 In all analyses, we weighted country data by 
their populations of children younger than 2 years of 
age (see appendix pp 18–22 for statistical methods).
We did systematic searches of the published literature, 
and, when possible, meta-analyses for outcomes 
postulated to be associated with breastfeeding (appendix 
pp 23–30). These systematic reviews and meta-analyses 
were specially commissioned by WHO to provide 
background information for this Series. 
We used the Lives Saved Tool8 to predict how many 
deaths of children younger than 5 years would be 
prevented if breastfeeding patterns as of 2013 were 
scaled up in the 75 countries that are part of the 
Countdown to 2015 eff
 ort,9 which account for more 
than 95% of all such deaths worldwide. We assumed 
that 95% of children younger than 1 month and 90% of 
those younger than 6 months would be exclusively 
breastfed, and that 90% of those aged 6–23 months 
would be partly breastfed. We applied the relative risks 
for the protection against all infectious causes of death 
obtained from our new meta-analyses10 to all infectious 
causes of death in children younger than 2 years, and 
also to the 15% of deaths caused by complications of 
prematurity that occur after the fi
 rst week of life 
Key messages
• 
Children who are breastfed for longer periods have lower 
infectious morbidity and mortality, fewer dental 
malocclusions, and higher intelligence than do those who 
are breastfed for shorter periods, or not breastfed. This 
inequality persists until later in life. Growing evidence also 
suggests that breastfeeding might protect against 
overweight and diabetes later in life.
• 
Breastfeeding benefi
 ts mothers. It can prevent breast 
cancer, improve birth spacing, and might reduce a 
woman’s risk of diabetes and ovarian cancer.
• 
High-income countries have shorter breastfeeding 
duration than do low-income and middle-income 
countries. However, even in low-income and 
middle-income countries, only 37% of infants younger 
than 6 months are exclusively breastfed.
• 
The scaling up of breastfeeding can prevent an estimated 
823 000 child deaths and 20 000 breast cancer deaths 
every year.
• 
Findings from studies done with modern biological 
techniques suggest novel mechanisms that characterise 
breastmilk as a personalised medicine for infants.
• 
Breastfeeding promotion is important in both rich and 
poor countries alike, and might contribute to 
achievement of the forthcoming Sustainable 
Development Goals.

(appendix pp 31–36). We also estimated the potential 
number of deaths from breast cancer that could have 
been prevented by extending the duration of 
breastfeeding (appendix pp 37–38).
Epidemiology: levels and trends
We obtained complete information about 127 of the 
139 LMICs (appendix pp 5–12), accounting for 99% of 
children from such countries. For high-income countries, 
we obtained data for 37 of 75 countries, but for several 
countries, only a subset of the indicators were available 
(appendix pp 13–17): these data should, therefore, be 
interpreted with caution.
Globally, the prevalence of breastfeeding at 12 months 
 
is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia, and parts of 
Latin America (fi
 gure 1). In most high-income countries, 
the prevalence is lower than 20% (appendix pp 13–17). 
We noted important diff
 erences—eg, between the UK 
(<1%) and the USA (27%), and between Norway (35%) 
and Sweden (16%).
We assessed breastfeeding indicators according to 
country income groups (fi
 gure 2). Information about early 
initiation or exclusive or continued breastfeeding at 
2 years was not available for most high-income countries. 
We noted a strong inverse correlation (Pearson’s r=–0·84; 
p<0·0001; appendix p 39) between breastfeeding at 
6 months and log gross domestic product per person; our 
regression analyses showed that for each doubling in the 
gross domestic product per head, breastfeeding prevalence 
at 12 months decreased by ten percentage points.
Most mothers in all country groups started breastfeeding; 
only three countries (France, Spain, and the USA) had 
rates below 80% for ever breastfeeding. However, early 
initiation was low in all settings, as was exclusive 
breastfeeding (fi
 gure 2). Breastfeeding at 12 months was 
widespread in low-income and lower-middle-income 
settings, but uncommon elsewhere.
Except for early initiation, prevalence of all indicators 
decreased with increasing national wealth. Low-income 
countries had a high prevalence of breastfeeding at all 
ages, but the rates of initiation and exclusive breastfeeding 
are unsatisfactory even in these countries.
Surprisingly, most national level breastfeeding 
indicators were not strongly correlated (appendix p 39). 
We found only a moderate correlation (Pearson’s 
r=0·54) between exclusive and continued breastfeeding 
at 1 year in LMICs. Although the prevalence of

continued breastfeeding was high throughout west and 
central Africa, rates of exclusive breastfeeding varied 
widely (fi
 gure 3). Countries from eastern and southern 
Africa tended to have on average lower rates of 
continued breastfeeding but higher rates of exclusive 
breastfeeding than did those in west Africa. In Latin 
America and the Caribbean, and in central and eastern 
Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, 
both indicators tended to be lower than in Africa. South 
Asian countries had high rates of both indicators 
whereas countries in the Middle East and north Africa 
had lower rates. Countries from east Asia and the Pacifi
 c 
region had moderate to high prevalence of both 
indicators.
In children younger than 6 months in LMICs, 
36·3 million (63%) were not exclusively breastfed at 
the time of the most recent national survey. The 
corresponding percentages were 53% in low-income 
countries, 61% in lower-middle-income countries, and 
63% in upper-middle-income countries. In children aged 
6–23 months in LMICs, 64·8 million (37%) were not 
receiving any breastmilk at the time of the most recent 
national survey, with corresponding rates of 18% in 
low-income, 34% in lower-middle-income, and 55% in 
upper-middle-income countries. 101·1 million children 
in LMICs were not breastfed according to international 
recommendations.
In most LMICs, data were available from several 
surveys over time, making it possible to explore time 
trends both at the national level and for children in the 
poorest and richest 20% of families. Our analyses 
were restricted to surveys for which breakdown of 
breastfeeding indicators by wealth quintiles was possible 
(214 surveys for exclusive and 217 for continued 
breastfeeding; appendix pp 18–22), accounting for 83% 
of the total 2010 population of children younger than 
2 years of age in LMICs. We reported linear trends 
because there was no evidence of departures from 
linearity. Exclusive breastfeeding rates increased slightly 
from 24·9% in 1993 to 35·7% in 2013 (fi
 gure 4). In the 
richest 20% of families, the increase was much steeper, 
whereas the poorest 20% followed the general trend. 
Continued breastfeeding at 1 year (12–15 months) 
dropped slightly at the global level (from 76·0% to 
73·3%), partly due to a decline among the poorest 20% in 
each country (fi
 gure 4).
Epidemiology: within-country inequalities
We analysed 98 surveys from LMICs to investigate 
within-country inequalities according to wealth quintile 
(appendix p 40). Wealth-related inequalities in exclusive 
breastfeeding were small but disparities in continued 
breastfeeding rates were consistent: poorer people tend 
to breastfeed for longer than their richer counterparts in 
all country groupings, but especially in middle-income 
countries. Similar results based on 33 countries have 
been reported elsewhere.11
Our review of studies from high-income countries 
showed that high-income, better-educated women breast-
feed more commonly than do those in low-income 
groups with fewer years of formal education.12–20 
Breastfeeding initiation in the USA was more common 
in mothers with lower education up until the 1960s, but 
the social gradient has since reversed.4

Breastfeeding is one of few positive health-related 
behaviours in LMICs that is less frequent in rich 
people, both between and within countries. The low 
rates of continued breastfeeding in richer families 
raises the possibility that poorer mothers will move 
towards breastmilk substitutes as their income 
increases, a concern that is reinforced by decreasing 
rates in poor populations.
Short-term eff
 ects in children: mortality and 
morbidity
The results of 28 meta-analyses on the associations 
between breastfeeding and outcomes in the children and 
mothers, of which 22 were commissioned for this Series, 
are summarised in the table. Because studies varied with 
regard to their feeding classifi
 cations, for several outcomes 
we compared longer versus shorter breastfeeding dur-
ations (eg, never vs ever breastfed, breastfed for less or 
more than a given number of months, and for a few 
outcomes longer vs shorter durations of exclusive 
breastfeeding). We tested for heterogeneity due to the type 
of breastfeeding categorisation, and in its absence we 
pooled the diff
 erent studies. We described the results of 
randomised trials on how breastfeeding promotion aff
 ects 
health, nutrition, or developmental outcomes, but not of 
trials in which the endpoint was restricted to breastfeeding 
indicators; these are reviewed in the second article in the 
Series.5
Only three studies in LMICs provide information about 
mortality according to exclusive, predominant, partial, or 
no breastfeeding in the fi
 rst 6 months of life (table). 
A strong protective eff
 ect was evident, with exclusively 
breastfed infants having only 12% of the risk of death 
compared with those who were not breastfed.10 Another 
three studies in LMICs showed that infants younger than 
6 months who were not breastfed had 3·5-times (boys) 
and 4·1-times (girls) increases in mortality compared 
with those who received any breastmilk, and that that 
protection decreased with age.33 These results are lent 
support by studies of children aged 6–23 months, in 
whom any breastfeeding was associated with a 50% 
reduction in deaths (table).
Breastfeeding might also protect against deaths in 
high-income countries. A meta-analysis of six high-quality 
studies showed that ever breastfeeding was associated 
with a 36% (95% CI 19–49) reduction in sudden infant 
deaths.34 Another meta-analysis of four randomised 
controlled trials showed a 58% (4–82) decrease in 
necrotising enterocolitis,34 a disorder with high case-fatality 
in all settings.35
In terms of child morbidity, overwhelming evidence 
exists from 66 diff
 erent analyses, mostly from LMICs 
and including three randomised controlled trials, that 
breastfeeding protects against diarrhoea and respiratory 
infections (table).21 About half of all diarrhoea episodes 
and a third of respiratory infections would be avoided by 
breastfeeding. Protection against hospital admissions 
due to these disorders is even greater: breastfeeding 
could prevent 72% of admissions for diarrhoea and 57% 
of those for respiratory infections. We discuss the risks 
associated with breastmilk substitutes in terms of 
biological and chemical contamination in appendix p 41.
Our reviews suggest important protection against 
otitis media in children younger than 2 years of age, 
mostly from high-income settings, but inconclusive 
fi
 ndings for older children (table).22 We saw no clear 
evidence of protection against allergic disorders: no 
association with eczema or food allergies and some 
evidence of protection against allergic rhinitis in 
children younger than 5 years.23 When we analysed the 
29 studies of asthma, we noted statistically signifi
 cant 
evidence of a 9% (95% CI 2–15) reduction in asthma 
with breastfeeding, but eff
 ects were smaller and 
non-signifi
 cant when we restricted analyses to the 
16 studies with tighter control of confounding (a 
reduction of 5% [−6 to 15]) or to the 13 cohort studies 
(6% reduction [−11 to 20]).
On the basis of 49 studies done mostly in LMICs, our 
analyses of oral health outcomes (table) showed that 
breastfeeding was associated with a 68% reduction 
(95% CI 60–75) in malocclusions.26 Most studies were 
restricted to young children with deciduous teeth, but 
malocclusion in this age group is a risk factor for 
malocclusion in permanent (adult) teeth.36,37 However, 
breastfeeding for longer than 12 months and nocturnal 
feeding were associated with 2–3-times increases in 
dental caries in deciduous teeth, possibly due to 
inadequate oral hygiene after feeding.25

Information about breastfeeding and child growth was 
derived from 17 studies, including 15 randomised 
controlled trials, mostly from middle-income countries.24 
Attained weight and length at about 6 months did not 
diff
 er, but there was a small reduction (Z score −0·06 
[95% CI –0·12 to 0·00]) in body-mass index (BMI) or 
bodyweight for length in children whose mothers 
received the breastfeeding promotion intervention 
compared with those whose mothers did not receive the 
promotion intervention (table).
Long-term eff
 ects in children: obesity, 
non-communicable diseases, and intelligence
We updated existing meta-analyses38 on the associations 
between breastfeeding and outcomes related to non-
communicable diseases (table). Most studies are from 
high-income settings. Based on all 113 studies identifi
 ed, 
longer periods of breastfeeding were associated with a 
26% reduction (95% CI 22–30) in the odds of overweight 
or obesity.27 The eff

more than 1500 participants and adjustment for 
socioeconomic status, maternal BMI and perinatal 
morbidity showed a pooled reduction in the prevalence 
of overweight or obesity of 13% (95% CI 6–19).
For the incidence of type 2 diabetes, the pooled results 
from 11 studies indicate a 35% reduction (95% CI 14–51). 
We deemed only three studies to be of high quality, 
which indicated a potentially important, but not 
statistically signifi
 cant, reduction of 24% (95% CI 
ranging from a 60% reduction to a 47% increase).27 The 
direction and magnitude of the association with 
diabetes are consistent with fi
 ndings for overweight. 
An earlier review of six studies indicated a possible 
protective eff
 ect against type 1 diabetes.34 The meta-
analyses for systolic (43 studies) and diastolic 
(38 studies) blood pressure, and total cholesterol 
(46 studies) showed no evidence of protective eff
 ects of 
breastfeeding.27
Breastfeeding was consistently associated with higher 
performance in intelligence tests in children and 
adolescents, with a pooled increase of 3·4 intelligence 
quotient (IQ) points (95% CI 2·3–4·6) based on the 
fi
 ndings of 16 observational studies that controlled for 
several confounding factors including home stimulation 
(table).28 Nine studies also adjusted for maternal 
intelligence, showing a pooled eff
 ect of 2·6 points 
(1·3–4·0). A large randomised trial reported an increase 
of more than 7 IQ points at 6·5 years of age,42 and a 
similar eff
 ect was reported in a non-randomised trial in 
which preterm infants were fed formula or breastmilk.43 
Positive associations with attained schooling were 
reported from the UK,44,45 New Zealand,46 and Brazil,47 but 
a joint analysis of four cohorts in LMICs showed mixed 
results.48 A study in Brazil including 30 years of follow-up 
suggested an eff
 ect of breastfeeding on intelligence, 
attained schooling, and adult earnings, with 72% of the 
eff
 ect of breastfeeding on income explained by the 
increase in IQ.49 A review of 18 studies suggested that 
breastfeeding is associated with a 19% reduction 
(95% CI 11–27) in the incidence of childhood leukaemia.50
Eff
 ects on the mother
The table shows the results of new reviews (published in 
July, 2015) on lactational amenorrhoea, breast and ovarian 
cancer, type 2 diabetes, and osteoporosis.29 We also cite 
existing reviews on diabetes, weight retention, and 
maternal depression. Most studies were from high-income 
countries, except for those on lactational amenorrhoea.
The role of breastfeeding in birth spacing is well 
recognised. In 2003, it was estimated that in countries 
where continued breastfeeding is prevalent, eg, Uganda 
and Burkina Faso, 50% more births would be expected in 
the absence of breastfeeding.51 Our review confi
 rms that 
increased breastfeeding, and especially exclusive or 
predominant breastfeeding, were associated with longer 
periods of amenorrhoea.29 Findings from randomised 
controlled trials of breastfeeding promotion interventions

 rm this eff
 ect.52

Evidence exists of a robust inverse association between 
breastfeeding and breast cancer (table). The largest 
individual-level analysis on this topic included about 
50 000 patients with cancer from 47 studies,30 which is 
about half those included in our meta-analysis. Each 
12-month increase in lifetime breast 
feeding was 
associated with a reduction of 4·3% (95% CI 2·9–6·8) in 
the incidence of invasive breast cancer. This analysis 
included 
thorough 
adjustment 
parity 
and 
other 
confounders; nulliparous women were excluded. The 
results did not vary substantially according to menopausal 
status. Our meta-analysis suggests a higher magnitude 
of protection, but when restricted to the 14 studies with 
fi
 ne adjustment for parity and exclusion of nulliparous 
women, the reduction comparing longer versus shorter 
breastfeeding durations was 7% (95% CI 3–11).29
The meta-analysis of 41 studies on breastfeeding and 
ovarian cancer shows a 30% reduction associated with 
longer periods of breastfeeding (95% CI 25–36). 
Confounding by parity might aff
 ect the results but socio-
economic confounding is unlikely because socioeconomic 
status is only weakly associated with ovarian cancer 
incidence. The pooled reduction, based on studies with 
fi
 ne adjustment for parity and exclusion of nulliparous 
women, was 18% (14–42).29 We also reviewed the evidence 
on osteoporosis, fi
 nding no evidence of an association 
between breastfeeding and bone mineral density in the 
four studies available (table).29
A meta-analysis of six cohort studies on type 2 
diabetes showed an odds ratio of 0·68 (95% CI 
0·57–0·82).31 In view of this fi
 nding, an association 
could be predicted with overweight, but a review of 
54 articles on the possible role of breastfeeding on post-
partum weight change was inconclusive.32 Few studies 
are available for the long-term association between 
nursing and adiposity. After the review of studies on 
overweight and breastfeeding was published, an 
analysis of 740 000 British women with long-term 
follow-up showed that mean BMI was 1% lower for 
every 6 months that the woman had breastfed.53 A 
qualitative 
review 
of 
48 
studies 
showed 
clear 
associations between breastfeeding and reduced mat-
ernal depression,54 but it is more likely that depression 
aff
 ects breastfeeding than the opposite.
Estimating lives saved for children and mothers
The Lives Saved Tool8 estimates that 823 000 annual 
deaths would be saved in 75 high-mortality LMICs in 
2015 if breastfeeding was scaled up to near universal 
levels. This corresponds to 13·8% of the deaths of 
children under 2 years of age. For preventable deaths, 
87% would have occurred in infants younger than 
6 months due to a combination of high death rates and 
low prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding.
We also estimated the potential eff
 ect of breastfeeding on 
breast cancer mortality (appendix pp 31–37). Using the 
estimates of protection from the pooled study, we estimate 
that existing global rates of breastfeeding avert 19 464 annual 
breast cancer deaths compared with a scenario in which no 
women breastfed (table).30 The low-income regions with 
long breastfeeding durations (Africa and south Asia) 
account for 58% of currently prevented deaths, despite only 
accounting for 36% of the global population included in 
this analysis. We also estimate that an additional 22 216 lives 
per year would be saved by increasing breastfeeding 
duration from present levels to 12 months per child in 
high-income countries and 2 years per child in LMICs. We 
cannot model the same eff
 ect in all countries given the 
diff
 erences in data availability and the fact that very few 
children in high-income countries are breastfed for longer 
than 12 months. Latin America, central and eastern Europe, 
the Commonwealth of Independent States, and high-
income countries would benefi
 t most because of their 
higher incidence of breast cancer and also shorter 
breastfeeding durations at present.
Conclusions
The fact that the reproductive cycle includes breastfeeding 
and pregnancy1 has been largely neglected by medical 
practice, leading to the assumption that breastmilk can be 
replaced with artifi
 cial products without detrimental 
consequences. This neglect is particularly important in 
high-income countries, where fewer than one in every 
fi
 ve children are breastfed by the age of 12 months. For 
each doubling in national gross domestic product per 
person, breastfeeding prevalence at 12 months decreases 
by 10 percentage points.
Findings from epidemiology and biology studies 
substantiate the fact that the decision to not breastfeed a 
child has major long-term eff
 ects on the health, nutrition, 
and development of the child and on women’s health. 
 
Possibly, no other health behaviour can aff
 ect such varied 
outcomes in the two individuals who are involved: the 
mother and the child. Findings from immunology, 
epigenetic, microbiome, and stem-cell studies done over 
the past two decades that elucidate potential mechanisms 
through which breastfeeding can improve outcomes will 
probably be followed by other, even more exciting dis-
coveries on the exquisite personalised medicine provided 
by human milk (panel).
Our global analyses show that more than 80% of 
neonates receive breastmilk in nearly all countries. 
However, only about half begin breastfeeding within the 
fi
 rst hour of life, even though such a recommendation was 
issued by WHO more than 25 years ago.70 Because 60% of 
the world’s children are now delivered by skilled assistants,9 
further promotion of early initiation is possible. In most 
countries, rates of exclusive breastfeeding are well below 
50%, and the correlation with the duration of any 
breastfeeding is only moderate. This fi
 nding signals the 
need to tailor breastfeeding support strategies to specifi
 c 
patterns recorded in each country. In the poorest countries, 
late initiation and low rates of exclusive breastfeeding are 
the main challenges. In middle-income and high-income 
 Series

countries, short overall duration of breastfeeding is an 
additional challenge.
Our time-trend analyses show that, for LMICs as a 
whole, exclusive breastfeeding has increased by about 
0·5 percentage points per year since 1993, reaching 35% 
in 2013. In 2012, the 56th World Health Assembly set as a 
target for 2025 to “increase the rate of exclusive 
breastfeeding in the fi
 rst 6 months up to at least 50%”.71 
 
Panel: Breastmilk—a personalised medicine
The nutritional advantages of breastfeeding and its protection 
against infection are well known. In the past two decades, the 
possibility that crucial imprinting events might be modulated 
during breastfeeding, with potential lifelong eff
 ects for the 
infant, has become apparent.55 These events might be mediated 
directly or through eff
 ects on the infant microbiome. The ability 
of the microbiome to regulate host responses in infancy 
depends on individual bacterial species, which modulate T-cell 
polarisation and immune regulation, metabolic responses, 
adipogenesis, and possibly even brain development and 
cognitive functioning.56,57 Abnormal colonisation patterns have 
a deleterious long-term eff
 ect on immune and metabolic 
homoeostasis. It is therefore remarkable that a mother’s 
breastmilk transmits elements of her own microbiome and 
immune responses, and also provides specifi
 c prebiotics to 
support growth of benefi
 cial bacteria.
Delivery mode initially established whether the gut fl
 ora of the 
mother (vaginal delivery) or the skin fl
 ora of the birth 
attendants (caesarean section) dominates the initial 
colonisers,58 which induce an important immune response in 
the infant. Feeding mode is the second fundamental 
determinant of the infant microbiome. Breastfed infants 
maintain persistent microbial diff
 erences, independent of 
delivery mode,59,60 owing to the eff
 ects of human milk 
oligosaccharides (HMOs). Human milk contains a much wider 
variety of sugars than other mammalian milks: up to 8% of its 
calorifi
 c value is provided in the form of indigestible HMOs, 
which function as prebiotics to support growth of specifi
 c 
bacteria. They cannot be used by most enteric organisms, but 
support growth of Bifi
 dobacterium longum biovar infantis, which 
has co-evolved to express the enzymes needed for the 
utilisation of HMOs.55 Substantial inter-individual variation 
exists in maternal HMO production, which in turn underpins the 
pattern of fl
 ora acquisition by the infant.61 Therefore, there is 
specifi
 city of the interaction between breastmilk and the infant 
microbiome, causing diff
 erent bacterially induced eff
 ects on the 
infant’s metabolism and immunity.
This specifi
 city of interaction is further underpinned by the 
mother’s enteromammary axis. To maintain her own gut 
homoeostasis, the mother’s intestinal dendritic cells take up 
individual bacteria from the lumen and transport them to gut 
lymphoid follicles,56 where T cells are committed to a regulatory 
phenotype and B cells shifted towards immunoglobulin A. 
Programmed dendritic cells and lymphocytes then re-enter the 
circulation before homing back to the gut through interaction 
between their induced β7 integrins and locally expressed 
mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 
(MAdCAM-1). MAdCAM-1 is expressed in the mammary 
endothelium during pregnancy, allowing selective uptake by 
the breast of gut-programmed cells.62 The consequences of 
enteromammary traffi
  cking include the release of dendritic cells 
containing live maternal gut bacteria, T cells expressing 
gut-derived β7 integrins, and plasma cells producing 
immunoglobulin A specifi
 c for maternal gut bacteria into the 
colostrum and breastmilk. Breastmilk therefore contains a 
dominance of immune cells of gut-related phenotype (γδ cells, 
β7+ cells) that have matured within the mother’s intestine.63 
Breastmilk cytokines also vary depending on the mother’s 
immunological experiences. Therefore, there is coordinated 
input to the infant’s nascent mucosal immune system, specifi
 c 
for the mother’s microbiome, in which individual bacterial types 
are favoured and tolerogenic immune responses are 
transmitted. Caesarean section, perinatal antibiotics, and failure 
to breastfeed are the three major factors that aff
 ect this 
co-evolved imprinting process. Findings from a study of fl
 ora 
acquisition and immune responses in primates identifi
 ed clear 
diff
 erences in both gut bacterial composition and mucosal 
immune responses in breastfed compared with formula-fed 
macaques, with the responses persisting into adult life.64
In addition to changes mediated through the fl
 ora, individual 
breastmilk components might directly aff
 ect epigenetic 
programming of the infant.65 The usual adverse eff
 ect of 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ polymorphisms 
on adiposity and metabolism is prevented by breastfeeding, 
possibly due to the content of peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor-modulating constituents such 
as long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and prostaglandin J.66 
Protection against breast cancer for a breastfeeding mother 
might also be mediated through peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor modulation.66 Lactoferrin, a 
major breastmilk component, binds bacterial CpG motifs and 
blunts mucosal NF-κB responses to the fl
 ora. Microvesicles 
called exosomes are secreted into breastmilk, and might inhibit 
atopic sensitisation dependent on maternal immune 
experience.67 Breastmilk fat globules contain many secreted 
micro-RNAs, the expression of which is modulated by maternal 
diet, which are predicted to target several genes in the infant.68 
Evidence also exists that multipotential stem cells are secreted 
into breastmilk and can persist within infants.69
Human breastmilk is therefore not only a perfectly adapted 
nutritional supply for the infant, but probably the most 
specifi
 c personalised medicine that he or she is likely to 
receive, given at a time when gene expression is being 
fi
 ne-tuned for life. This is an opportunity for health imprinting 
that should not be missed.

To achieve this goal would need a doubling of the recent 
annual increase, to more than 1 percentage point a year 
in the next decade, which is already the rate for the 
richest 20% of people. In view of the benefi
 ts of exclusive 
breastfeeding and of present achievements by leading 
countries, could a more ambitious target not be aimed 
for? The Assembly did not set a goal for continued 
breastfeeding.
In terms of inequalities, our fi
 ndings show that 
breastfeeding is one of the few positive health behaviours 
that is more prevalent in poor than in rich countries. 
They also show that poor women breastfeed for longer 
than rich women in LMICs, whereas in high-income 
countries the pattern is reversed. These results suggest 
that breastfeeding patterns are contributing to reducing 
the health gaps between rich and poor children in 
LMICs, which would be even greater in the absence of 
breastfeeding.
In LMICs, there are no inequalities between rich and 
poor mothers in exclusive breastfeeding rates. Findings 
from our time-trend analyses suggest that this is because 
rich mothers are adopting exclusive breastfeeding at a 
much faster rate than are poor mothers—only 20 years 
ago, the poorer mothers had substantially higher rates of 
exclusive breastfeeding. Continued breastfeeding is 
still more common in poor mothers than in wealthy 
mothers, but rates seem to be dropping among these 
while remaining stable in rich mothers. Protecting 
breastfeeding in the world’s poorest populations is 
therefore a major priority.
Our systematic reviews emphasise how important 
breastfeeding is for all women and children, irrespective 
of where they live and of whether they are rich or poor. 
Appropriate breastfeeding practices prevent child 
morbidity due to diarrhoea, respiratory infections, and 
otitis media. Where infectious diseases are common 
causes of death, breastfeeding provides major protection, 
but even in high-income populations it lowers mortality 
from causes such as necrotising enterocolitis and 
sudden infant death syndrome. Available evidence 
shows that breastfeeding enhances human capital by 
increasing intelligence. It also helps nursing women by 
preventing breast cancer. Additionally, our review 
suggests likely eff
 ects on overweight and diabetes in 
breastfed children, and on ovarian cancer and diabetes 
in mothers. The only harmful consequence of breast-
feeding we detected was an increase in tooth decay in 
children breastfed for more than 12 months. In view of 
the many benefi
 ts of breastfeeding, this observation 
should not lead to discontinuation of breastfeeding but 
rather to improved oral hygiene.
Findings from our systematic reviews are restricted by 
the observational nature of most of the available data for 
breastfeeding and by the limitations of meta-analyses.72,73 
Experimental data are scarce because breastfeeding 
promotion activities must be highly eff
 ective to change 
feeding patterns to an extent that leads to a measurable 
eff
 ect on short-term and long-term outcomes. Moreover, 
confounding can occur because breastfeeding is associated 
with higher socioeconomic position in high-income 
countries. Our reviews included subanalyses of studies 
with tight control for confounding. Whenever possible, 
we also did separate analyses of studies from LMICs, 
because poor individuals tend to breastfeed for longer 
than rich people in these countries (appendix p 40), an 
association that is reversed in high-income countries. 
Interpretation of associations is also aff
 ected by the fact 
that non-breastfed infants receive diff
 erent diets in 
diff
 erent countries—eg, animal milk in most poor 
societies and formula in middle-income and high-income 
populations. The association between breastfeeding and 
overweight, for example, is probably aff
 ected by the diet of 
infants who are not breastfed.
No consensus exists about whether or not breastfeeding 
can protect against a child’s later risk of overweight or 
diabetes,34,38,41 largely because of potential residual con-
founding. Although the evidence is not as strong as it is 
for infections or intelligence, we argue that the evidence 
linking breastfeeding with protection from later 
overweight or diabetes is growing. Findings from our 
meta-analyses showed that the association persisted 
when restricted to only high-quality studies, and also 
when restricted to studies from only low-income and 
middle-income settings. The association seems to be 
specifi
 c—eg, we noted no eff
 ect on blood pressure or 
blood lipid concentrations, for which confounding 
patterns are similar. Finally, fi
 ndings from randomised 
trials of breastfeeding promotion in infancy indicate a 
reduction in adiposity.
The scaling up of breastfeeding practices to almost 
universal levels is estimated to prevent 823 000 annual 
deaths, or 13·8% of all deaths of children younger than 
24 months in the 75 Countdown to 20159 countries. The 
target of 95% of all infants younger than 6 months 
having exclusive breastfeeding is ambitious because at 
present the highest national prevalences are 85% in 
Rwanda and 76% in Sri Lanka. We also used a target of 
90% for any breastfeeding from 6–23 months, but fi
 ve 
countries already have levels that are above this target 
(Nepal, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Burundi, and Guinea). 
We acknowledge that these targets are ambitious, but the 
estimates show the potential for lives saved if mothers 
and children adhered to international recommendations. 
Despite diff
 erences in methods, our estimates about 
potential lives saved are consistent with those from the 
2013 Lancet Nutrition Series (804 000 deaths)74 but higher 
than those from the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study 
(540 000 deaths),75 in which the assumptions and 
methods were not suffi
  ciently detailed to understand the 
reasons for the discrepancy. Breast 
feeding is potentially 
one of the top interventions for reducing under-5 
mortality, and the modest changes in breastfeeding rates 
since 2000 have contributed to the fact that most LMICs 
did not reach the fourth Millennium Development Goal, 
 Series
488 
www.thelancet.com   Vol 387   January 30, 2016
to reduce under-5 mortality by two-thirds.76 We show that 
increasing exclusive breastfeeding should be among the 
top priorities for reducing infant deaths.
As an example of the potential to save women’s lives, 
we estimated that present rates of breastfeeding prevent 
almost 20 000 annual deaths from breast cancer, and 
an additional 20 000 are preventable by scaling up 
breastfeeding practices (appendix). To achieve its full 
eff
 ect, breastfeeding should continue up to the age of 
2 years. Protection against mortality and morbidity from 
infectious diseases extends well into the second year of 
life—eg, breastfeeding prevents half of deaths caused by 
infections in children aged 6–23 months. Protection 
against otitis media, a common childhood illness 
throughout the world, also extends to 2 years and possibly 
beyond. Findings from studies of overweight and obesity 
show that longer durations of breastfeeding are associated 
with lower risk, as do studies of IQ showing a clear dose–
response association with duration. Breast cancer is 
reduced by lifetime duration of breastfeeding in women, 
with a 6% reduction for every 12 months.50 Findings from 
ethnographical research show that total duration of 
breastfeeding ranges between 2 and 4 years in most 
traditional societies,77 and our review of the literature 
lends support to international recommendations about 
the total duration of breastfeeding, in both high-income 
and low-income countries.
Data availability for breastfeeding patterns shows an 
unusual distribution. Health authorities and researchers 
in high-income countries seem to neglect breastfeeding 
to such an extent that most of these countries are unable 
to report on reliable, standardised indicators. This 
situation contrasts sharply with the high quality of data 
for breastfeeding in LMICs, as a consequence of the 
regular conduct of standardised surveys such as the 
Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator 
Cluster Surveys. 
Our fi
 ndings show how essential the protection, 
promotion, and support of breastfeeding is for the 
achievement of many of the newly launched Sustainable 
Development Goals by 2030. Breastfeeding is clearly 
relevant to the third sustainable goal, which includes 
not 
only 
maternal 
and 
child 
health 
but 
also 
non-communicable diseases such as breast cancer and 
diabetes as well as overweight and obesity. It is also relevant 
to the second goal (on nutrition). The eff
 ect of breastfeeding 
on intelligence and on human capital is relevant to the 
fourth goal (education), the fi
 rst goal (poverty), and the 
eighth goal (inclusive economic growth). Finally, by 
helping close the gap between rich and poor, breastfeeding 
can contribute to goal number ten—reducing inequalities.
