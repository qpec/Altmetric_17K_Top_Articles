ohn Fitzgerald Kennedy (JFK), the 35th president of 
the United States and the youngest candidate elected 
to the Oval Office, was portrayed as a dynamic man 
full of vigor and youthful energy.61 This aura of vitality be-
lied the fact that he was patently unhealthy from an early 
age.14,57 The full extent of his wide array of medical prob-
lems, especially relating to his time in the Oval Office, 
remained a secret as directed by the Kennedy family until 
2001.1 Low-back pain, just one of Kennedy’s many medi-
cal problems, prompted a total of 4 largely unsuccessful 
surgeries. This pain affected him nearly continually from 
his undergraduate years at Harvard until the day of his 
assassination.
A Childhood of Poor Health: Numerous 
Illnesses and Hospitalizations
John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born the second of 8 
children to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald 
Kennedy in Brookline, Massachusetts, on May 29, 1917. 
Several months shy of his 3rd birthday, young “Jack” con-
tracted scarlet fever and was hospitalized; his condition 
ultimately deteriorated to the brink of death.14,31,33,57,62 His 
childhood health troubles continued; he would be treated 
for a host of illnesses prior to his graduation from prepara-
tory school.1,14,21,24,57 In fact, Robert F. Kennedy would later 
recall that “when we were growing up together we used to 
laugh about the great risk a mosquito took in biting Jack 
Kennedy—with some of his blood the mosquito was almost 
sure to die.”51
Collegiate Years: Origins of Low-Back Pain 
and First Consultation
Jack would add yet another entry to an already prodi-
gious list of health problems during his undergraduate years 
at Harvard: low-back pain. The exact details of the inciting 
event remain murky, but the most commonly accepted ac-
count traces the onset of low-back pain to a football injury 
he sustained while at Harvard in 1937.2,5,21,26,29,32,33,57
Kennedy continued to be plagued with back pain af-
ter graduating from Harvard University in June 1940 and 
was referred to Dr. Gilbert “Ned” Haggart, an orthopedic 
spine specialist at the Lahey Clinic in Boston, who diag-
nosed him with a “very unstable lumbosacral joint.” Dr. 
Haggart recommended a course of conservative treatment 
in the form of a manipulation of the back under anesthe-
sia, which JFK underwent at the Lahey Clinic in 1940. Dr. 
Haggart also introduced the idea of a sacroiliac fusion if 
the conservative treatment failed.22,23,29

John F. Kennedy’s back: chronic pain, failed surgeries, 
and the story of its effects on his life and death

Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas
The 35th president of the United States, John F. Kennedy (JFK), experienced chronic back pain beginning in his early 
20s. He underwent a total of 4 back operations, including a discectomy, an instrumentation and fusion, and 2 relatively 
minor surgeries that failed to significantly improve his pain. The authors examined the nature and etiology of JFK’s back 
pain and performed a detailed investigation into the former president’s numerous medical evaluations and treatment 
modalities. This information may lead to a better understanding of the profound effects that JFK’s chronic back pain and 
its treatment had on his life and presidency, and even his death.

John F. Kennedy’s back pain would begin to play a cen-
tral role in his overall health going forward. Immediately, 
it would affect his prospects for military service.
1940–1943: Failed Military Physicals and the 
PT-109
On October 29, 1940, John Kennedy, age 23 years and 
the son of the US ambassador to Great Britain, was draft-
ed for service in the US military.70 Although selected, his 
student status at Stanford qualified him for an automatic 
deferment.14,66 He then tried to enlist in the Army but was 
rejected due to health issues, particularly his bad back. He 
then applied to the Navy Officer Candidate School in 1941, 
but failed the physical.14,24 Ultimately, via the connections 
of his ex-ambassador father, JFK was commissioned as an 
ensign in the US Naval Reserve on September 25, 1941.28
Within months, Kennedy’s back troubles would prompt 
further consultations—Dr. Marius Smith-Petersen con-
cluded: “I don’t think this is a disc since the pain com-
plained of does not even remotely resemble a disc.”26,29 Dr. 
Smith-Petersen requested that JFK also consult with Dr. 
James White, a naval neurosurgeon who agreed that Ken-
nedy’s current pain was inconsistent with sciatica.29 The 
decision was made against surgical intervention. By late 
June 1942, Ensign Kennedy was declared fit for duty.14,29,55
Kennedy then applied for and was accepted into mid-
shipman school in the spring of 1942 with his eye on ac-
tive sea duty.29 He ultimately was accepted to patrol tor-
pedo (PT) boat training school. Kennedy, who just several 
months before had been hospitalized for his back issues, 
would again need intercession from his father to gain ac-
ceptance to the highly competitive PT boat training pro-
gram. Despite his back pain, Kennedy completed PT boat 
training and was ultimately ordered to the Pacific theater 
on January 8, 1943.25
Within months of arriving in the Pacific, Kennedy’s 
boat was rammed by a Japanese destroyer, killing 2 crew 
members and stranding Kennedy and his surviving ship-
mates, marking the beginning of the famous PT-109 epi-
sode in which Kennedy towed a badly wounded crewman 
with the strap of his life jacket clenched between his teeth 
for a punishing 5-hour swim to a nearby island. The sur-
vivors were eventually rescued and Kennedy would serve 
another 6 weeks before ending his Pacific tour of duty on 
November 18, 1943.5,14,15,24,50,51
June 23, 1944: The First Back Surgery
Surviving the collision with the Japanese destroyer 
and enduring the grueling nature of the subsequent rescue 
worsened JFK’s back problems.5 Therefore, once he re-
turned stateside, he was evaluated by a team of physicians 
at the Mayo Clinic, including noted orthopedist Dr. Ralph 
Gormley, who summarized Lt. Kennedy’s condition at 
that time as “confined … to the region of the left sacroiliac 
with pain in the posterior part of the left hip down as far 
as the knee.”15,18,19,29
Given that Kennedy’s presentation was not an obvious 
one for a herniated disc, he underwent an air myelogram 
and the Mayo team stated that “a diagnosis of a protruded 
disk was not definite … at this time you are not in need 
of surgery.”31
Kennedy eventually proceeded with surgery. He was 
admitted to New England Baptist Hospital and on June 23 
he underwent a left L4–5 laminotomy and L5–S1 discec-
tomy performed by Dr. James Poppen, neurosurgeon at 
the Lahey Clinic16,29 (Fig. 1). JFK initially did well for 2 
weeks postoperatively, before the onset of severe muscle 
spasms on an attempt to ambulate. At 6 weeks postopera-
tively, Poppen wrote:
On June twenty-third I did a unilateral exploration of the 
fourth and fifth lumbar interspaces. The fourth space was 
completely normal. However, the nerve in the fifth interspace 
was reddened and underlying this, the disk interspace material 
was abnormally soft and the posterior longitudinal ligament 
was firmly adherent to the nerve root. There, however, was 
very little protrusion of the ruptured cartilage. A thorough 
removal of the degenerative portion of the cartilage was car-
ried out…. The patient did well following the operation for 
a period of two weeks. Upon having the patient get up and 
about, however, severe muscle spasms in the low back took 
place. These necessitated fairly large doses of narcotics to 
keep him comfortable.… I have had nine other patients in a 
series of over five hundred ruptured intervertebral disks with 
a similar experience…. I am indeed sorry that this had to hap-
pen with Lieutenant Kennedy.29
Kennedy was subsequently transferred to the Chelsea 
Naval Hospital for recovery and another evaluation by Dr. 
James White, the same neurosurgeon who had seen him at 
the request of Dr. Smith-Petersen before JFK’s assignment 
in the Pacific. Dr. White described Kennedy as “obviously 
incapacitated by pain in low back and down the left leg” 
and questioned the indication for the lumbar surgery be-
cause air was the agent used for the myelogram and not 
Pantopaque.26,29
At this time, myelography was performed with gas, air, 
or oxygen, or with agents such as iodinated lipoid or io-
dine salts. Controversy surrounded the respective merits 
of the available agents: Pantopaque uptake provided excel-
lent evidence of the subarachnoid space and the nerve root 
sheath; however, this process was not without complica-
tions—including oil granulomas and arachnoiditis from 
the residual contrast material. Air, on the other hand, could 
be used without such risks. It absorbed quickly and had no 
lasting effects on the membranes of the spinal cord.71 Per-
haps due to Jack Kennedy’s prominent status as a war hero 
and the son of Joseph Kennedy, air was the agent chosen 
for the myelogram instead of a potentially more accurate 
and risky study performed with Pantopaque.
Although his preoperative air spinogram is not housed 
at the JFK Presidential Library and thus is not available 
for review, we were able to review preoperative lumbar ra-
diographs dated May 20, 1942, in addition to postoperative 
films dated December 14, 1944. These demonstrate a nor-
mal lumbar lordotic curve with well-aligned facet joints 
and no evidence of spondylolisthesis or discernible sacro-
iliac disease. There was no evidence for loss of vertebral 
body or interspace height, and no obvious radiographic 
laminotomy defects or other abnormalities evident on the 
postoperative films—essentially JFK had a radiographi-
cally normal-appearing lumbar spine in December 1944.

surgery, wrote: “In regard to the fascinating subject of 
my operation … I think the doc should have read just one 
more book before picking up the saw.”24,65
While recovering at Chelsea Naval Hospital in the fall 
of 1944, Jack received word that his older brother Joe had 
been killed in action in England.24 Late in 1944, JFK’s 
back troubles eventually eased up although his gastroin-
testinal difficulties continued—prompting the Navy to de-
clare him permanently unfit for service on November 25, 
1944. JFK was back in the civilian sector, now the heir 
to the family political aspirations once cast upon his late 
brother.
Congressional Years: Continued Back Pain 
and Diagnosis of Addison’s Disease
In April 1946, JFK declared his candidacy for the US 
House of Representatives, Massachusetts 11th district. 
The next several months of campaigning exhausted the 
29-year-old Kennedy—described by a campaign worker 
as “crippled.” His back pain returned, and care of his back 
required a daily regimen of therapy involving back rubs, 
hot baths, and regular use of his back brace.11,44,52 The rig-
ors of campaigning took their toll, culminating with JFK’s 
collapse while marching in a parade on June 17, 1946, less 
than 24 hours before the election.5 Nonetheless, the fol-
lowing day JFK was elected to Congress, nearly 2 years 
after his failed discectomy surgery.24,44
Kennedy’s first term in Congress would be marred by 
health difficulties, with a particularly grave event occur-
ring in his 1st year in office during a trip to England. In 
an effort to treat his long-standing gastrointestinal disease, 
Kennedy probably began taking corticosteroids in the late 
1930s or early 1940s via subcutaneously implanted corti-
costeroid tablets that became available in 1937.14,72 His in-
souciant attitude toward medications led to an abrupt ces-
sation of steroid intake and precipitated a severe adrenal 
crisis in 1947 during an overseas trip to London. Kennedy 
became severely ill, requiring hospitalization in London, 
and was eventually diagnosed with Addison’s disease—
probably secondary to chronic steroid intake. The situa-
tion was so dire, in fact, that he was read his last rites of 
the Catholic Church upon his arrival stateside.14
Despite his ongoing health problems, Kennedy’s ser-
vice in the House of Representatives over the next few 
years crystallized his desire to advance his political ca-
reer. To bolster his statewide profile, Congressman Kenne-
dy began crisscrossing Massachusetts, usually beginning 
at dawn and ending after midnight—an intense schedule 
likely to be unforgiving to his back.14 Dave Powers, his 
longtime political advisor, stated that Kennedy had to 
travel “with crutches … gritting his teeth when he walked 
… but then when he came into the room where the crowd 
was gathered, he was erect and smiling, looking as fit and 
healthy as the light-heavyweight champion of the world. 
Then after he finished his speech and answered questions 
from the floor and shook hands with everyone, we would 
help him into the car and he would lean back on the seat 
and close his eyes in pain.”20,56 The grueling schedule and 
work paid off; after 7 years in the House of Representa-
tives Kennedy was elected to the US Senate in 1952.
The Senate Years: Second Back Surgery—
Lumbosacral Instrumentation and Fusion 
With Dr. Philip Wilson Sr.
Kennedy’s back troubles progressed further during 
his Senate years and he required the near-constant use of 
crutches by the spring of 1954.20,28,47,49,56 After evaluations 
at the Lahey Clinic, Bethesda Naval Hospital, and Hospi-
tal for Special Surgery in 1954, Senator Kennedy decided 
to proceed with a lumbosacral fusion operation despite the 
high risk of complications or death in the context of his 
Addison’s disease.63 Rose Kennedy would later remember, 
“Jack was determined to have the operation. He told his 
father that even if the risks were fifty-fifty, he would rather 
be dead than spend the rest of his life hobbling on crutches 
and paralyzed by pain.”21
Kennedy’s anteroposterior and lateral lumbosacral ra-
diographs from January 1954, which we viewed at the JFK 
Presidential Library and Museum, demonstrate marked 
loss of height at the previously surgically treated L5–S1 
disc space (approximately 70%) when we compared it 
with the most recent previous film from 1944. There is no 
evidence of compression fractures as has been reported

by historian Robert Dallek in his 2003 bestselling JFK 
biography.14
Senator Kennedy was admitted to the Hospital for Spe-
cial Surgery, New York, on October 10, 1954. After sev-
eral weeks of preoperative optimization to reduce the risk 
of a potentially fatal adrenal crisis related to his Addison’s 
Disease, he underwent a 3-hour procedure for sacroiliac 
and lumbosacral fusion on October 21, 1954, with implan-
tation of a Wilson plate by the physician who developed 
the plate, Dr. Philip Wilson Sr., a renowned orthopedic 
surgeon and a Harvard classmate of JFK’s father.28,43,53, 
57,60
The Wilson plate was a Vitallium (cobalt-chromium 
alloy) implant that was curved to mimic lumbar lordosis 
and secured to the spinous processes with horizontally 
oriented locking bolts (Figs. 2 and 3) in a procedure first 
described by Dr. Wilson in May 1943.12,26,73
Postoperative radiographs dated November 12, 1954, 
demonstrated Kennedy’s implant spanning L5–S2 via 3 
transverse bolts attached to the spinous processes on the 
right side and augmented with a wire at the L-5 spinous 
process, along with a defect at the left sacroiliac joint con-
sistent with bone graft placement for sacroiliac arthrodesis.

 The story of JFK’s chronic back pain and failed surgeries
J Neurosurg Spine Volume 27 • September 2017
251
Hospital for Special Surgery, Kennedy’s surgery and post-
operative course were published anonymously by his sur-
gical team as Case 3 in a 1955 case series documenting 
survivors and perioperative management in patients with 
adrenocortical insufficiency.53 His postoperative course 
was described as “satisfactory in that no Addisonian cri-
sis developed” and he experienced “minor complications, 
consisting of a urinary tract infection on the third postop-
erative day, a transfusion reaction … and a mild wound 
infection despite antibiotic therapy.” The paper’s brief de-
scription of his postoperative course in fact greatly mini-
mized his difficult recovery—the urinary tract infection 
was so severe it precipitated a coma, and the family, an-
ticipating death, rushed to Jack’s side where he was again 
read his last rites.47,57 However, he eventually improved and 
was discharged from the hospital to continue his recovery 
in Palm Beach, Florida, on December 21, 1954—exactly 2 
months after his surgery.57
His recovery in Palm Beach would continue to be 
complicated by a “staphylococcal infection”69 and was de-
scribed by Ted Sorenson, a longtime advisor and friend, as 
an “open, gaping, very sickly looking hole.”65,69 LeMoyne 
Billings, another JFK confidant who visited him during 
this time, would later state “the area where they cut into 
his back never healed. It was oozing blood and pus all the 
time. It must have been painful beyond belief…. It was 
an open wound that seemed to be infected all the time. 
And now and then a piece of bone would come out of the 
wound. His pain was excruciating.”59
When it became apparent that the open draining wound 
was infected and not healing, Kennedy returned to the 
Hospital for Special Surgery for his third back opera-
tion, consisting of hardware explantation, on February 10, 
1955.53,57
Senator Kennedy’s lumbar radiographs dated April 27, 
1955—housed at the JFK Library and reviewed by us—
show no changes (aside from interval implant removal) in 
comparison with the January 5, 1955, films. Joe Kennedy 
would reflect on his son’s recovery from these operations 
by reporting that he twice came within minutes of dying, 
leading some to speculate that he was twice read his last 
rites during this period.17,20,49,57 Kennedy’s 1954 surgery 
and the subsequent life-threatening complications would 
require months of recovery, preventing him from return-
ing to the Senate until May of 1955—at which time the 
incision from his February hardware removal had only 
recently healed.57,69
In 1955, Kennedy was introduced to Dr. Janet Travell, 
a Cornell University pharmacologist and internal medi-
cine specialist known for her work using trigger-point in-
jections of local anesthetics to treat myofascial pain. Dr. 
Travell promptly admitted Senator Kennedy to the New 
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center to jump-start his 
rehabilitation program.64,69 Kennedy, who celebrated his 
38th birthday during this hospitalization, was treated with 
ethyl chloride spray and procaine trigger-point injections.
This hospitalization marked the first of hundreds, if not 
thousands, of procaine trigger-point injections he would 
receive over his lifetime and introduced Kennedy to what 
would, in a few short years, become a symbol of his presi-
dency—the rocking chair.69 More importantly, it marks the 
end of his major back surgeries and a shift in focus toward 
muscular and environmental factors contributing to his 
back pain. The emphasis regarding treatment of his back 
would move in a more cautious direction going forward, 
and notable functional restoration would be seen over the 
next few months.69
The Late 1950s: Kennedy’s Last and  
Most Uncomplicated Back Surgery
In addition to the rocking chair, Travell made other 
changes, including providing Kennedy with a heel lift—
raising the possibility of pelvic obliquity and leg-length 
discrepancy as a contributing factor in Kennedy’s low-
back pain. These changes, combined with procaine injec-
tions and a muscle-strengthening program, led to signifi-
cant improvement in JFK’s low-back health and overall 
functioning during this time. His back surgeries, however, 
were not completely behind him; in September 1957 “a 
painful point of redness appeared in the midline opera-
tive scar of the lumbar spine fusion.”70 He was diagnosed 
with a superficial lumbar abscess, and admitted again to 
the Hospital for Special Surgery on September 13, 1957. 
Preston Wade, a general surgeon, opened the abscess 
down to the spinal processes of L-4 and L-5—a markedly 
less invasive surgery than the senator’s first 3 operations. 
Cultures grew coagulase-positive Staphylococcus au-
reus69—approximately 3 years after JFK’s October 1954 
fusion procedure.
According to Travell, radiographs of the lumbosacral 
spine and pelvis obtained on September 13, 1957, 
… showed variation in the density of the left sacral wing 
compatible with chronic osteomyelitis. Repeat films of the 
lumbosacral spine on 09/20/57 showed degeneration of the 
lumbosacral disk with inflammatory process near the left 
sacroiliac joint, possibly due to osteomyelitis. The patient 
continued to do well, except for occasional muscle spasms 
which were relieved by procaine infiltration. Full ambulation 
was begun and the patient was discharged after 19 days of 
hospitalization. 
In our opinion, the radiographic abnormalities Dr. Travell 
is referring to in the left sacroiliac region are more con-
sistent with the postoperative changes from the sacroiliac 
arthrodesis performed during the fusion procedure.
The next few years would be a period of relatively good 
health for Kennedy, and were punctuated by his 1958 Sen-
ate reelection in which he received 73.6% of the popular 
vote, the largest margin of victory ever recorded in a Mas-
sachusetts Senate race.14 His ascendant national profile put 
him squarely in the race as the Democratic nominee for 
the presidential election in 1960—a race that would pub-
licize concerns regarding his health on the national stage.
The 1960 Election and 1961: “Dr. Feelgood’s” 
Methamphetamine Injections and a Relapse 
of Back Pain
Days before the Democratic National Convention 
opened on July 11, 1960, JFK’s opponent for the Demo-
cratic nomination and soon-to-be running mate, Lyndon 
Johnson, raised serious doubts about Kennedy’s health—
 T. G. Pait and J. T. Dowdy

252
publicly divulging the Addison’s diagnosis and asking for 
an evaluation of his overall health.14 Although his back 
was in comparatively decent shape, the 1960 campaign 
took its toll, prompting Kennedy to seek the services of Dr. 
Max Jacobson, a German immigrant practicing in New 
York.45,70 Jacobson, whose patients nicknamed him “Dr. 
Feelgood,” injected then-Senator Kennedy for the first 
time in the summer of 1960 with his “vitamin cocktail” 
that included amphetamine derivatives.4,45 Kennedy, who 
received an injection from Jacobson shortly before the first 
and pivotal famous televised debate with Richard Nixon, 
was elected president of the US on November 8, 1960, in a 
closely contested election.14,45
Within several months after taking office Kennedy in-
jured his back during a ceremonial tree-planting incident 
in Ottawa, Canada, in May 1961. Over the ensuing sum-
mer JFK’s “physical condition was at its worst point in 
years. Not for a long time had he been in such agony.”58 
This prompted a return to frequent use of crutches, pro-
caine injections, his corset brace,9,10,14,58 and an increase in 
the illicit injections from Jacobson.45 The poor state of his 
back and its effect on JFK’s overall well-being may have 
had a considerable and negative impact on the President’s 
performance at the crucial Vienna summit with Soviet 
Premier Nikita Khrushchev in June 1961. In fact, on the 
1st day of the tense summit the president received at least 
3 of the methamphetamine-containing shots.27,45 Reeling 
from the nerve-wracking summit, his aching back, and the 
likely side effects of Jacobson’s methamphetamine shots, 
the “very gloomy” Kennedy admitted immediately after 
it ended that the summit did not go well—reflecting that 
Khrushchev “just beat the hell out of me.”13,45,62,67 The rest 
of the summer would provide no respite from his debilitat-
ing back pain and would prompt a reassessment of the care 
administered by Dr. Travell.
Fall 1961 to Summer 1963: Burkley, Kraus, 
and a Ban on Procaine Injections
Deeply concerned about the overall condition of Ken-
nedy’s back and the increasing use of Travell’s procaine 
shots, Rear Admiral George C. Burkley (a White House 
physician since Eisenhower’s administration) informally 
took over the responsibility of ministering to JFK’s over-
all health in the summer and fall of 1961 and consulted 
noted orthopedist and physiatrist Hans Kraus to evalu-
ate the state of the president’s back.9,14,58,62 The Austrian-
born Dr. Kraus first evaluated the president in October of 
1961 and found him “completely unrehabilitated.”58 Kraus 
and Burkley then placed Kennedy on an exercise and re-
habilitation program built around the White House pool 
and gym.58,62 The program consisted of a combination 
of thrice-weekly weight-lifting sessions and near-daily 
swims, along with massage and heat therapy14—and paid 
immediate dividends. Within months, the improvement 
was dramatic.8,29,58
JFK’s Lumbar Spine: Radiographic 
Perspective
Kennedy’s radiographs, many of which are housed at 
the JFK Presidential Library and Museum, do not support 
the claim that JFK was born with an unstable lumbosacral 
joint as diagnosed by Haggart29 or the assertion by JFK 
biographer and historian Robert Dallek that Kennedy suf-
fered from a steroid-induced compression fracture.14 Based 
on our review of the radiographs, there is no evidence for 
spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, or congenital lack of 
lumbar lordosis. Probably consequent to his L5–S1 disc-
ectomy surgery in 1944, radiographs did show progressive 
loss of height of the L5–S1 intervertebral disc space by the 
time of his 1954 lumbosacral instrumentation and fusion 
operation. The best-quality radiographs from the end of 
the president’s life are dated March 14, 1962, and show 
no evidence of the aforementioned compression fractures 
or coronal deformity or listhesis. They do, however, dem-
onstrate neural foraminal narrowing at L5–S1 and near-
complete loss of lumbar lordosis, which was not evident 
on films from 18 years prior. These films also demonstrate 
some evidence of fusion of the L5–S1 facet joints bilat-
erally, indicating that the 1954 operation was successful 
in producing at least some degree of radiographic fusion.

Summer and Fall of 1963: Did a Relapse of 
Back Pain Contribute to Kennedy’s Death?
As the condition of Kennedy’s back continued to im-
prove, Kraus sought to wean the president from the long-
time use of his corset as early as the summer of 1962.29 
Kraus encountered a setback in his quest to break Ken-
nedy’s reliance on his use of back orthotics on August 
31, 1963, when a new round of discomfort was diagnosed 
by Preston Wade as a left iliopsoas strain. Wade advised 
“heat, rest … and the application of an Ace bandage spi-
ca,”30 which was similar to, if not the same, Ace bandage 
used to augment the president’s regular canvas corset—
both of which were cut off of JFK during the resuscitation 
attempts at Parkland Hospital.
Some minor setbacks notwithstanding, it is clear that 
the period beginning in the fall of 1961 that defines Hans 
Kraus’s management of Kennedy’s back problems ushered 
in a period of sustained and remarkable improvement in 
the health of JFK’s back. Dave Powers, special assistant to 
the president and a close friend, wrote about meeting with 
the president in the Oval Office the morning of November 
21, 1963, prior to his departure to Texas. Powers recalled 
“he looked taller than his six feet” and had “the build of 
a light heavyweight boxer.”61 The iliopsoas strain experi-
enced by Kennedy in August 1963 and, consequently, the 
more stringent use of the brace and its augmentation with 
the Ace bandage thereafter may have played an ominous 
role in the events of the following day.
It has been theorized by Dr. John Lattimer, a well-
published physician expert on the Kennedy assassination 
and the first nongovernmental official to review highly 
restricted materials such as autopsy photographs, radio-
graphs, clothing, and other materials housed at the Nation-
al Archives,34–42 that the use of this tightly bound lumbar

brace returned the president to an upright position after the 
potentially survivable first shot and back into Lee Harvey 
Oswald’s scope sight, allowing the second obviously fatal 
shot to the head. Had the president not been wearing the 
augmented brace, he might have crumpled forward and re-
mained out of Oswald’s line of fire.36,37,42
While books and articles exploring the seemingly limit-
less controversies surrounding President Kennedy’s death 
abound in the popular press, a wealth of excellent articles 
also exists within the medical literature that address many 
aspects of the assassination.3,6–8,34–42,46,48,54,68 Several salient 
points bear review in regard to the brace’s role and contri-
bution to the president’s death. It is by no means assured 
that President Kennedy could have survived the initial 
neck wound.35,37,42 Kennedy probably would have faced an 
uphill battle for survival even without the obviously fatal 
brain wound, because his chronic corticosteroid use would 
have conferred a reduced capacity to fight a potential in-
fection of the neck and mediastinum that might have been 
triggered by the first bullet’s path.42
Another point of controversy concerns the ability of 
his brace to promote an upright posture after the first bul-
let struck Kennedy. Dr. Pepper Jenkins, then the chief of 
the Anesthesiology Department at Parkland Hospital and 
present during the attempted resuscitation of the president, 
describes the brace on the day of the assassination: “He 
was tightly laced into this brace with wide Ace bandages 
making figure-of-eight loops around his trunk and around 
his thighs.”7 Robert Hart, a contemporary orthopedic 
spine specialist, stated in his 2005 article on JFK26 that 
he remains unconvinced that the brace played a significant 
role in Kennedy’s death. Nevertheless, it is certainly well 
within the realm of possibility that Kennedy’s augmented 
canvas corset that was bound tightly around the president’s 
hips and lower back could have played a role in setting up 
Oswald’s final shot.
Ultimately, it’s impossible to know with certainty how 
significant a role the brace played in JFK’s death on No-
vember 22, 1963. Either way, President Kennedy’s decision 
to continue wearing the brace against Hans Kraus’s advice 
shortly before his death is a fascinating and evocative foot-
note given its potential role in altering the course of US 
and world history, and serves as yet another unanswered 
question surrounding that fateful day.
Conclusions
John F. Kennedy, despite the public image of youthful 
vitality he and his family so carefully crafted and protect-
ed during his lifetime, was afflicted by a litany of serious 
illnesses.
The etiology of Kennedy’s low-back pain, in our opin-
ion, was probably multifactorial in origin, with symptoms 
of mechanical low-back pain, sacroiliac joint disease, 
and lumbar radiculopathy leading to many attempts at 
conservative therapy and multiple failed spinal surger-
ies including a fusion procedure—an unfortunate pattern 
of treatment and outcomes that contemporary spine sur-
geons continue to struggle with at times in a small subset 
of patients. Another curious footnote to JFK’s spine treat-
ment introduces the potential problem of “VIP care” as 
well—the decision to perform an air myelogram instead 
of the more accurate but riskier Pantopaque myelogram, 
which ultimately did little to resolve the question of a her-
niated disc prior to his unsuccessful discectomy proce-
dure. Ultimately, Kennedy’s symptoms and progression of 
care echo a refrain similar to those of patients who are 
ultimately diagnosed as suffering from failed–back sur-
gery syndrome.
Personally, JFK remains a case study in the complexity 
of human nature—an affluent political scion turned war 
hero, a serial philanderer and methamphetamine user, a 
civil-rights supporter and initiator of the Vietnam War who 
was both the youngest man elected president in the na-
tion’s history and perhaps the 20th century’s least healthy 
one. His 1000 days in office encompassed a challenging 
period filled with civil unrest and the haunting specter 
of nuclear war. Unbeknownst to the general public, Ken-
nedy faced these external challenges while also battling 
the internal challenge of back pain that was all too often 
debilitating, and he relied on a near-daily therapy regimen, 
at times using various combinations of exercise, massage, 
procaine injections, support orthotics, crutches, narcotics, 
and illicit intravenous injections of methamphetamines in 
an attempt to manage this pain. By virtue of a relapse of 
pain in August of 1963 prompting more frequent use of an 
augmented brace, back pain may have ultimately played a 
role in President Kennedy’s death.
Despite the chronic pain and sometimes less than ad-
mirable measures used in the treatment of the pain, Ken-
nedy repeatedly demonstrated a commendable inclination 
toward stoicism and bravery highlighted most famously in 
the PT-109 incident—an incident that made him a deco-
rated World War II hero and helped launch his political 
career. His exploits not only in the Pacific but generally, 
in living a life of extraordinary achievement in the face of 
chronic pain, speak to the power of tenacity and the resil-
ience innate to his character.
After the assassination, Robert F. Kennedy summarized 
his brother’s resolute attitude toward his health: “At least 
one half of the days that he spent on this earth were days 
of intense physical pain … I never heard him complain. I 
never heard him say anything that would indicate that he 
felt God had dealt with him unjustly. Those who know him 
well would know he was suffering only because his face 
was a little whiter, the lines around his eyes were a little 
deeper, his words a little sharper. Those who did not know 
him well detected nothing.”51
