Abstract 
Introduction: Excessive thoracic kyphosis is considered a predisposing factor for shoulder 
pain, though there is uncertainty about the nature of the relationship between shoulder pain 
and thoracic spine posture. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the 
relationship between thoracic kyphosis and shoulder pain, shoulder range of motion (ROM) 
and function. Methods: Two reviewers independently searched eight electronic databases 
and identified relevant studies by applying eligibility criteria. Sources of bias were assessed 
independently by two reviewers using a previously validated tool (Ijaz et al., 2013). Data 
were synthesised using a level of evidence approach (van Tulder et al., 2003).  Results: Ten 
studies were included. Four studies were rated as low risk of bias, three at moderate risk of 
bias and three at high risk of bias. There is a moderate level of evidence of no significant 
difference in thoracic kyphosis between groups with and without shoulder pain. One study at 
high risk of bias demonstrated significantly greater thoracic kyphosis in people with shoulder 
pain (p<0.05). There is a strong level of evidence that maximum shoulder ROM is greater in 
erect postures compared to slouched postures (p<0.001), in people with and without shoulder 
pain. Conclusions: Thoracic kyphosis may not be an important contributor to the 
development of shoulder pain. While there is evidence that reducing thoracic kyphosis 
facilitates greater shoulder ROM, this is based on single-session studies whose long-term 
clinical relevance is unclear. Higher quality research is warranted to fully explore the role of 
thoracic posture in shoulder pain.

Introduction 
Shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal condition and is often associated with 
substantial morbidity, with a third of patients demonstrating persisting restriction of 
movement, loss of function and/or pain after one year (Reilingh et al., 2008; Greving et al., 
2012). The most common source of shoulder pain reported in clinical practice is subacromial 
pain (van der Windt et al., 1995). Subacromial pain syndrome (SAPS) has been described as 
non-traumatic shoulder pain, localised around the acromion, which worsens during or 
subsequent to lifting the arm (Blanked, 2011). Due to the limited diagnostic accuracy of 
clinical tests (Blanked, 2009), SAPS has been adopted as an overarching term encompassing 
subacromial impingement, bursitis and rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy (Blanked 2011; 
Diercks et al., 2014; Engebretsen et al., 2009). The pain and limitation of shoulder movement 
associated with shoulder pain may reduce shoulder function and health-related quality of life 
(Duckworth et al., 1999; MacDermid et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2000).  
The role of the thoracic spine in shoulder mechanics has been investigated. Previous 
studies have demonstrated that approximately 15º of thoracic extension mobility is required 
for full bilateral shoulder flexion, in both younger and older populations (Crawford and Jull, 
1993). Other research suggests that full unilateral arm elevation requires approximately 9º of 
thoracic extension (Stewart et al., 1995). Thoracic hyperkyphosis, an angulation of the 
thoracic spine of greater than 40º (Greendale et al., 2011) or 50º (Willner, 1981; Teixeira and 
Carvalho, 2007), has been implicated as a contributing factor to shoulder pain (Grimsby and 
Gray, 1997). Crawford and Jull demonstrated that older adults with a large thoracic kyphosis 
had reduced arm elevation (Crawford and Jull, 1993). A recent cross sectional study 
involving 525 volunteers compared the prevalence of rotator cuff tears across four postural 
classifications; ideal alignment, kyphotic-lordotic posture, flat-back posture and sway-back 
posture (Yamamoto et al., 2015). This study reported that the prevalence of rotator cuff tears, 
diagnosed using ultrasound, was lowest in the ideal posture at 2.9% and highest in the 
kyphotic-lordotic posture at 65.8%, which points towards a posture-impairment model. 
Several hypotheses have been proposed to describe the mechanisms by which thoracic 
hyperkyphosis effects the shoulder. Firstly, it has been postulated that a small increase in 
thoracic kyphosis is associated with a more elevated and anteriorly tilted resting position of 
the scapula in pain-free participants (Kebaetse et al., 1999; Culham and Peat, 1993). As a 
result, the acromion may be in a more inferior and anterior position, hypothetically reducing 
the subacromial space (Solem-Bertoft et al., 1993; Borstad et al., 2006). An additional 
hypothesis suggests that thoracic spine curvature may influence the shoulder girdle through 
muscular attachments (Michener et al., 2003) and by altering the length-tension relationship 
of the muscles attached to the scapula (Grimsby and Gray, 1997). The evidence to support 
these hypotheses is scant and investigations of the relationship of thoracic kyphosis with the 
shoulder girdle have been largely conducted in pain-free populations.  
 The impingement model of the shoulder has been widely challenged in recent 
research with a variety of other mechanisms such as mechanical overload or lifestyle factors 
purported to be important in the development of shoulder pain (Blanked, 2011; Blanked et 
al., 2015). In addition, a recent systematic review concluded that there is insufficient 
evidence for the role of scapula orientation in SAPS (Ratcliffe et al., 2014). This leaves

considerable uncertainty concerning the relationship between spinal posture and shoulder 
pain. The aim of this systematic review is to establish the current level of evidence regarding 
the relationship between thoracic kyphosis and shoulder pain, function and range of motion 
(ROM). The specific research questions are: 
1. Is there a difference in thoracic kyphosis between groups with and without 
shoulder pain? 
2. What is the effect of changing thoracic kyphosis on shoulder pain, function 
and ROM in people with or without shoulder pain? 
 
Methods 
This review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement (Liberati et al., 2009) and was 
registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42015024834). 
Identification and selection of studies 
An electronic search was conducted by two reviewers (EB, MOK) in July 2015 using 
the following databases: Medline, CINAHL, AMED, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, 
PsycARTICLES, General Science and Biomedical Reference Collection. A combination of 
three search lines was used;  
("shoulder" OR "glenohumeral") [Title/Abstract] AND (“range” OR “movement” OR 
“motion” OR “pain” OR “function*” OR “disability” OR “symptom*” OR "dyskinesi*") 
[Title/Abstract] AND (“spin*” OR "alignment" OR "hyperkypho*" OR "kypho*" OR 
"postur*" OR “orientation” OR “biomechanic*” OR “curv*” OR "thora*") [Title/Abstract]. 
Two reviewers (EB, MOK) independently screened the title and abstract of each article, 
followed by the full texts of those deemed potentially relevant, applying the eligibility 
criteria. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are displayed in Table 1. Both observational and 
experimental studies were eligible for inclusion. The reference lists of the included studies 
were manually searched for other relevant studies. 
 
Assessment of risk of bias 
 
Sources of bias were assessed independently by two reviewers (EB, MOK) using a 
standardised checklist of 10 criteria (Ijaz et al., 2013) which was validated for use in 
observational studies (Shamliyan et al., 2010). Each item was rated as a low, high or unclear 
risk of bias. The 10 items were divided into two hierarchical groups (Ijaz et al., 2013). The 
group with the major items of bias included exposure definition, exposure assessment, 
reliability of exposure assessment, analysis bias and confounding factors. The remaining five 
items were considered as minor domains: attrition, blinding of assessors, selective reporting, 
funding and conflict of interest. Studies were considered as low risk of bias if they had low 
 MANUSCRIPT

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
risk in all major domains and ≥2 of the minor domains, moderate risk of bias if they had low 
risk of bias in ≥4 major and 2 minor domains, or high risk of bias if they had low risk of bias 
in <4 major domains (Ijaz et al., 2013). 
For the purpose of this review, the exposure was considered to be thoracic kyphosis. 
Therefore, to be scored as a low risk of bias in the domain of exposure definition, the level of 
spinous processes where measurement was taken was required to be stated. To be scored as 
low risk of bias in the domain of exposure assessment, the study must have used an objective 
measurement of thoracic kyphosis, thereby providing a thoracic kyphosis angle. To be scored 
as low risk of bias in the domain of reliability exposure assessment, the reliability of the 
measurement tool must have been stated, either by measuring the tool’s reliability in a pilot 
study or providing reference to its previously established level of reliability. To be scored as 
low risk of bias in the domain of confounders, between group comparisons of thoracic 
kyphosis must contain samples of similar gender and age, as these variables influence 
thoracic kyphosis angle (Fon et al., 1980). The remaining six domains were rated as 
previously recommended (Ijaz et al., 2013). 
 
Data analysis 
 
One reviewer (EB) extracted data relating to the study design, study population, 
postures used and outcome measures related to shoulder pain, range of motion and/or 
function. Variation in the study designs, study population and outcome measures used did not 
permit the pooling of data in a meta-analysis. Data were synthesized using a level of evidence 
approach (van Tulder et al., 2003), taking into account the risk of bias, the design of the study 
and the outcomes of the included studies. Definitions for levels of evidence are outlined in 
Table 2.  
 
Results 
Flow of trials through the review 
Figure 1 details the flow of studies through the review process. A total of ten studies 
involving 2,794 participants were included in the review. 
Characteristics of the included studies 
Design 
Six studies utilised a cross-sectional design which compared thoracic kyphosis between 
groups with and without shoulder pain (Blanked et al., 2005a; McClure et al., 2006; Otoshi et 
al., 2014; Blanked and Valentine, 2010; Theisen et al., 2010; Greenfield et al., 1995). Four 
studies used a same-participant repeated measures design to examine whether different 
thoracic spine postures influence shoulder ROM. Two of these studies involved a pain-free 
population (Kanlayanaphotporn et al., 2014; Kebaetse et al., 1999), one study included 
participants with SAPS (Bullock et al., 2005) and one used a group with and a group without

SIS (Blanked et al., 2005b). Two studies that met the eligibility criteria for this review used 
the same participants to investigate different outcomes of relevance to the review (Blanked et 
al., 2005a; Blanked et al., 2005b). One of these studies compared thoracic kyphosis in people 
with and without shoulder pain (Blanked et al., 2005a) and one compared shoulder ROM in 
different thoracic postures (Blanked et al., 2005b). Study characteristics are displayed in 
more detail in Table 3. 
Risk of bias 
Four studies were deemed to be at low risk of bias (Kanlayanaphotporn et al., 2014; 
Bullock et al., 2005; Blanked et al., 2005b; Blanked and Valentine, 2010), three at moderate 
risk of bias (Kebaetse et al., 1999; McClure et al., 2006; Blanked et al., 2005a) and three at 
high risk of bias (Otoshi et al., 2014; Theisen et al., 2010; Greenfield et al., 1995). Every 
study demonstrated a low risk of bias when defining thoracic kyphosis and measuring 
thoracic kyphosis objectively, reported all of their intended outcomes and had no loss to 
follow-up. One study (Otoshi et al., 2014) did not report the reliability of their method for 
thoracic kyphosis measurement and used cut-off points for restriction of shoulder ROM, 
rather than absolute values. Six studies (Blanked et al., 2005a; Kebaetse et al., 1999; McClure 
et al., 2006; Theisen et al., 2010; Greenfield et al., 1995; Otoshi et al., 2014) did not carry out 
a power calculation or reach statistical power. Seven studies did not use blinded assessors 
(Kebaetse et al., 1999; Blanked et al., 2005a; Blanked et al., 2005b; Otoshi et al., 2014; 
McClure et al., 2006; Bullock et al., 2005; Greenfield et al., 1995). Seven studies did not 
report on potential conflicts of interest (Blanked et al., 2005a; Blanked et al., 2005b; McClure 
et al., 2006; Otoshi et al., 2014; Kanlayanaphotporn et al., 2014; Greenfield et al., 1995; 
Bullock et al., 2005) The involvement of the funding body with the investigations was 
unclear in five studies (Kebaetse et al., 1999; McClure et al., 2006; Kanlayanaphotporn et al., 
2014; Greenfield et al., 1995; Bullock et al., 2005). Full details are shown in Table 4.  
Outcome measures 
A variety of methods were used for thoracic kyphosis measurement. Three studies 
used the Flexicurve ruler, measuring from T12 to either T2 (Greenfield et al., 1995; Bullock 
et al., 2005) or C7 (Kanlayanaphotporn et al., 2014). Four studies used a gravity-dependant 
manual inclinometer, one measured at T3 (McClure et al., 2006) and three from T1/T2 to 
T12/L1 (Blanked et al., 2005a; Blanked et al., 2005b; Blanked and Valentine, 2010). Both the 
Flexicurve and the manual inclinometer have been previously shown to have excellent levels 
of intra-rater and inter-rater reliability (Blanked et al., 2013). One study measured thoracic 
kyphosis using the Metrecom Skeletal Analysis System which digitised landmarks two inches 
above and below both T2 and Tll (Kebaetse et al., 1999). The reliability of this method for 
thoracic kyphosis measurement was previously reported to range from an intraclass 
correlation co-efficient of 0.72 to 0.83 (Fiebert et al., 1993). One study used the wall occiput 
test (WOT) in which a positive or negative result was obtained based on the participant’s 
ability to touch a wall behind them with their occiput (Otoshi et al., 2014). However, this 
measures the extent of thoracic kyphosis while the person tries to press their head back 
against a firm surface, it could be argued this measures thoracic mobility rather than thoracic

curvature. One study used ultrasound topography (Theisen et al., 2010), for which the 
reliability of static thoracic kyphosis measurement was not reported. 
 
The effect of thoracic kyphosis on shoulder pain 
 
Six studies (Blanked et al., 2005a; McClure et al., 2006; Otoshi et al., 2014; Theisen 
et al., 2010; Greenfield et al., 1995; Blanked and Valentine, 2010) compared resting thoracic 
kyphosis in groups with and without shoulder pain. Values for these are shown in Table 5. In 
comparing a group with SIS to those without shoulder pain, Blanked and colleagues reported 
that there were no significant differences in resting standing thoracic kyphosis (Blanked et 
al., 2005a). While this study did not meet adequate statistical power and was rated at a 
moderate risk of bias, a later study by the same research group was at low risk of bias and 
reported no significant differences in resting standing thoracic kyphosis between groups with 
and without shoulder pain (Blanked and Valentine, 2010). Similarly, two further studies 
which compared a group with SIS to an age- and gender-matched control group reported no 
significant difference in resting thoracic posture (McClure et al., 2006; Theisen et al., 2010). 
However, these were considered to be at a moderate (McClure et al., 2006) and high (Theisen 
et al., 2010) risk of bias. A study with a high risk of bias which compared thoracic kyphosis 
in a group of people with mixed shoulder diagnoses to a pain-free control group demonstrated 
no significant difference between groups (Greenfield et al., 1995). 
In contrast, one study with a high risk of bias (Otoshi et al., 2014) reported that there 
was a significant association between a positive WOT and the diagnosis of SIS (OR 1.65, 
95% CI 1.02, 2.64). 
 
The effect of changing thoracic kyphosis on shoulder function 
 
No studies were found that investigated the effect of changing thoracic kyphosis on the 
outcome of shoulder function. 
 
The effect of changing thoracic kyphosis on shoulder ROM 
 
Two studies, of low (Kanlayanaphotporn et al., 2014) and moderate (Kebaetse et al., 
1999) risk of bias, reported that erect postures increased shoulder ROM when compared to a 
slouched posture in pain-free participants. One of these compared three different sitting 
postures (erect, comfortable slouched and maximum slouched) and found that reduced 
thoracic kyphosis significantly improved shoulder flexion, abduction and external rotation 
(Kanlayanaphotporn et al., 2014). Conversely, mean shoulder internal rotation ROM 
increased by approximately 20% from the erect to maximum slouched posture. Kebaetse and 
colleagues also reported significantly more maximum active shoulder abduction ROM in an 
erect posture compared to a slouched posture (Kebaetse et al., 1999). A further study of low 
risk of bias reported similar findings people with SAPS, demonstrating a statistically 
significant improvement in mean angle of shoulder flexion in an erect posture in comparison 
to a slouched posture in people with SAPS (Bullock et al., 2005). Additionally, this study 
recorded pain intensity during shoulder flexion in both postures. The mean pain intensity on a 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
100mm visual analogue scale (VAS) was reported as 38.89 when sitting slouched and 34.39 
when sitting erect (mean difference =4.50±17.93mm), indicating no statistically significant 
difference in pain intensity between postures (Bullock et al., 2005). One study of low risk of 
bias reported that, in people with SIS, significantly greater shoulder ROM to the point of 
onset or worsening of shoulder pain was achieved following scapular and thoracic taping 
aimed at thoracic extension compared to normal resting posture (p<0.001) (Blanked et al., 
2005b). However, no significant differences were found on VAS pain rating for shoulder 
flexion (p=0.14) or scapular plane abduction (p=0.11) between postures. In the group who 
did not have shoulder pain, thoracic extension using taping significantly increased maximum 
shoulder ROM compared to resting thoracic posture (p<0.001). Data relating to posture and 
shoulder ROM are displayed in Table 6. All four studies checked that the mean thoracic 
kyphosis angle significantly changed between postures (Kanlayanaphotporn et al., 2014; 
Kebaetse et al., 1999; Bullock et al., 2005; Blanked et al., 2005b). 
Two of the studies which measured the relationship between thoracic kyphosis and 
shoulder pain (Blanked et al., 2005a; Otoshi et al., 2014) also investigated the association 
between shoulder ROM and thoracic kyphosis. Blanked and colleagues reported a poor 
association between resting thoracic kyphosis and shoulder flexion (Kendall coefficient for 
participants without SIS= –0.173, p=0.057 and with SIS= –0.016, p= 0.858) or abduction 
ROM (Kendall coefficient for participants without SIS= –0.146, p=0.110 and with SIS= –
0.005, p= 0.959) (Blanked et al., 2005a). In contrast, one study reported a significant, positive 
association between a positive WOT (increased thoracic kyphosis) and restricted shoulder 
flexion ROM (OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.80, 3.46), based on splitting shoulder ROM among 
participants as greater than or less than 150º (Otoshi et al., 2014). 
 
Discussion 
Main findings 
The most important finding of the review indicates that there is moderate evidence 
(one study at low risk of bias, two at moderate risk of bias and two at high risk of bias) of no 
association between increased thoracic kyphosis and shoulder pain. Although one other study 
did report a significant association between thoracic kyphosis and shoulder pain, this study 
was at high risk of bias. Further, there is strong evidence (three studies at low risk of bias, 
one at moderate risk of bias) that slouched postures, which increase thoracic kyphosis, are 
associated with reduced shoulder flexion and abduction ROM in participants with and 
without shoulder pain. None of the eligible studies investigated the association between 
thoracic posture and shoulder function. 
The effect of thoracic kyphosis on shoulder pain 
 
Five studies of varying risk of bias reported that there was no significant difference in 
static resting thoracic kyphosis between groups with and without shoulder pain (Blanked et 
al., 2005a; McClure et al., 2006; Theisen et al., 2010; Greenfield et al., 1995; Blanked and 
Valentine, 2010). However, this should be viewed in light of the methodological weaknesses 
 MANUSCRIPT

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
of these studies, which include insufficient power to detect between group differences and 
lack of assessor blinding. While acknowledging these limitations, the findings of the studies 
pose some challenge to the role of thoracic kyphosis in the development and maintenance of 
shoulder pain. Blanked and colleagues, who measured resting thoracic kyphosis, forward 
head posture and scapula position, demonstrated that neither groups with or without shoulder 
pain conformed to a specific posture (Blanked et al., 2005a). The findings challenge the 
hypothesis that an ideal spinal posture exists from which deviation causes or contributes to 
shoulder pain. The etiology of shoulder pain is still debated and may be multi-factorial in 
nature, potentially influenced by mechanical overload (McClure et al., 2006), degenerative 
changes (Seitz et al., 2011), genetics and lifestyle factors (Tashjian et al., 2009; Rechardt et 
al., 2010). 
In addition to these potential sources of nocioception, the potential role of the central 
nervous system (CNS) in maintaining shoulder pain has also been recognised (Littlewood et 
al., 2014). Of the studies included in this review which have provided information of the 
duration of symptoms of their participants, all have indicated symptoms of greater than 3 
months duration (Blanked et al., 2005; McClure et al., 2006; Theisen et al., 2010; Bullock et 
al., 2005) which suggests that chronic pain processes are likely to be involved. In light of this, 
the relative role of thoracic hyperkyphosis as a driver of pain may be reduced in the presence 
of heightened CNS sensitivity and it highlights that CNS factors may sometimes have a 
greater role. 
One study demonstrated that a positive WOT was more prevalent in a group with SIS 
compared to pain-free participants (Otoshi et al., 2014). Caution must be taken when 
interpreting the implications of this as this study had several aforementioned methodological 
weaknesses. In addition to indicating the extent of thoracic kyphosis, the authors suggest that 
the WOT also measures thoracic mobility, where a positive WOT may indicate a restriction 
in thoracic spine mobility (Otoshi et al., 2014). Therefore, its potential for comparison to the 
five other studies which measure static degree of thoracic kyphosis is debatable.  
The suggestion that thoracic mobility may be a contributing factor in the development 
of SIS has also been evaluated by other research.  It has been reported that thoracic mobility 
was significantly less in patients with SIS compared with a control group (Meurer et al., 
2004). It has also been reported that greater restriction of segmental mobility of the thoracic 
spine was present in a group of people with SIS compared with pain-free controls, whereas 
static kyphosis did not differ between groups (Theisen et al., 2010). While this review 
focuses on the role of static thoracic posture, it would be valuable to further examine the 
influence of thoracic mobility on shoulder pain, function and ROM as this was outside the 
scope of this review.  
 
The effect of thoracic kyphosis on shoulder ROM 
 
This review found strong evidence that increasing thoracic kyphosis through slouched 
sitting reduces maximum shoulder ROM. The reduced shoulder ROM in slouched sitting may 
be explained by positional changes of the scapula into a more protracted, anteriorly tilted and 
medially rotated position, potentially acting as a mechanical block to shoulder elevation 
(Donatelli, 2004). It is also worth considering that the change in thoracic kyphosis with 
 MANUSCRIPT

slouched sitting is likely to be accompanied by changes in cervical and lumbar lordosis 
(Bullock et al., 2005; Blanked et al., 2005b), as well as changes in the activation of a range of 
scapulothoracic muscles (Claus et al., 2005). Therefore, the specific mechanisms through 
which a change in thoracic kyphosis alters shoulder ROM are unclear. 
Three studies that compared shoulder ROM between postures in this review used the 
extremes of sitting postures, which may not reflect how people move in a real life scenario. 
Only one study compared shoulder movement between a normal and erect thoracic posture 
(Blanked et al., 2005b), demonstrating that a smaller change in thoracic kyphosis can also 
improve shoulder ROM. However, both studies which assessed shoulder pain intensity during 
shoulder movement reported that pain intensity was not changed between postures.  
 
Implications for future research  
 
All eligible studies were either cross-sectional studies or involved repeated-measures 
on a single day. These approaches provide limited information to detect whether thoracic 
hyperkyphosis leads to shoulder pain and shoulder ROM deficits over time. Even if the 
studies had reported significant differences in thoracic kyphosis between groups, it would not 
have been possible to establish whether the thoracic hyperkyphosis preceded the shoulder 
symptoms or if the thoracic hyperkyphosis was a postural adaptation to shoulder pain. The 
scope of these designs can only provide evidence on the immediate effects of changing 
thoracic kyphosis on shoulder symptoms and/or provide information regarding the prevalence 
of thoracic hyperkyphosis in groups with and without pain. Therefore, prospective studies 
where thoracic kyphosis and shoulder outcomes (pain, function and ROM) are monitored 
longitudinally may develop understanding of the role of the thoracic spine in the etiology and 
management of shoulder pain. Furthermore, studies which compare the treatment of shoulder 
pain with and without the inclusion of a thoracic posture rehabilitation component would 
provide clarity on the usefulness of altering thoracic posture in this patient group. 
 
Implications for clinical practice 
 
A limitation of this review is the relatively low number of included studies and the 
methodological weaknesses of the studies. However clinicians should be cautious when 
attempting to change thoracic kyphosis among people with shoulder pain, until the 
emergence of higher quality research to support this practice. One option is to examine 
whether patient symptoms are immediately modifiable by altering thoracic kyphosis, as this 
might partially justify such an approach. The Shoulder Symptom Modification Procedure 
(SSMP) (Blanked, 2009) uses such a model, where the immediate effect of changing thoracic 
kyphosis, among a range of other postural variables, on the patient’s symptoms is 
investigated. As described previously, another important consideration is the likelihood that a 
patient’s symptoms are related to nociceptive input, given what is now known about the role 
of central pain mechanisms in the maintenance of chronic pain conditions (Butler and 
Moseley, 2003). Using the history and clinical examination to gauge the degree to which 
central pain mechanisms are involved in shoulder pain, may also allow for a more patient 
specific approach to the assessment and rehabilitation of shoulder pain.

Conclusion 
 
There is a moderate level of evidence of no association between increased thoracic kyphosis 
and shoulder pain. Strong conclusions cannot be made due to the methodological weaknesses 
of many of the included studies. There is strong evidence that erect sitting postures which 
reduce thoracic kyphosis are associated with an immediate improvement in shoulder flexion 
and abduction ROM in participants with and without shoulder pain, although this has only 
been examined in a single session. There is a need for further research in the form of 
prospective cohort studies to investigate any potential relationships between thoracic 
hyperkyphosis and shoulder pain as well as studies examining the specific value of thoracic 
postural rehabilitation in populations with painful shoulders.
