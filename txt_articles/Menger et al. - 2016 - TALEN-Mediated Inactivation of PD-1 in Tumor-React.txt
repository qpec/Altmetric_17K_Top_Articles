Abstract
Despite the promising efficacy of adoptive cell therapies (ACT)
in melanoma, complete response rates remain relatively low and
outcomes in other cancers are less impressive. The immunosup-
pressive nature of the tumor microenvironment and the expres-
sion of immune-inhibitory ligands, such as PD-L1/CD274 by the
tumor and stroma are considered key factors limiting efficacy. The
addition of checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) to ACT protocols
bypasses some mechanisms of immunosuppression, but associ-
ated toxicities remain a significant concern. To overcome PD-L1–
mediated immunosuppression and reduce CPI-associated toxi-
cities, we used TALEN technology to render tumor-reactive T cells
resistant to PD-1 signaling. Here, we demonstrate that inactiva-
tion of the PD-1 gene in melanoma-reactive CD8þ T cells and
in fibrosarcoma-reactive polyclonal T cells enhanced the per-
sistence of PD-1 gene-modified T cells at the tumor site and
increased tumor control. These results illustrate the feasibility
and potency of approaches incorporating advanced gene-edit-
ing technologies into ACT protocols to silence immune check-
points as a strategy to overcome locally active immune escape
pathways. Cancer Res; 76(8); 2087–93. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using autologous tumor-infil-
trating lymphocytes (TIL) or T cells redirected to the tumor by
chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) can mediate substantial
regression of human cancers (1). Although multiple early-
phase studies using ACT have demonstrated durable responses
that correlate with persistence of the transferred T cells (2, 3),
their in vivo activity and potency can be thwarted by the
complex immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvi-
ronment (4). Combination protocols incorporating checkpoint
inhibitors (CPI) such as anti–CTLA-4 or anti–PD-L1/PD-1 are
currently being considered (NCT02408861; NCT02210117;
NCT02374242; NCT02453620), but the potential exacerbation
of the toxicities associated with CPIs may limit their imple-
mentation. Advanced genetic engineering of the ACT product
offers potential solution to the toxicity issues by specifically
targeting tumor-reactive T cells rather than inducing systemic
checkpoint blockade. The protocols used for the generation of
ACT are compatible with genetic manipulation of cells before
transfer, which can be used to increase the proliferative capacity
of lymphocytes (5), prolong their in vivo persistence (6),
improve tumor infiltration (7), and bypass tumor immune
suppression.
Programmed death-1 (PD-1, CD279) is one of the key coin-
hibitory immune receptors expressed by activated T cells. Initially
described on a T-cell hybridoma undergoing cell death (8), PD-1
is a critical regulator of T-cell responses and essential to the
maintenance of peripheral self-tolerance (9). In mouse and
human cancers, high levels of PD-1 are found on TILs, although
its ligand (PD-L1) is upregulated by tumor and stromal cells in
response to inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFNg; refs. 10, 11). The
PDL-1–PD-1 axis plays a major role in tumor growth and immune
escape through inhibition of T-cell proliferation, effector function
(12), and of T-cell survival by promotion of apoptosis (13). The
administration of blocking anti–PD-L1 or PDL-1 antibodies in
vivo results in enhanced CD8þ T cell responses and decreases
tumor burden in mouse models of cancer (14, 15). In humans,
expression of PD-1 by TILs is associated with impaired effector
function and/or poor outcome in several tumor types (16, 17).
Direct evidence supporting the importance of this pathway in
modulating antitumor immunity comes from recent clinical trials
in melanoma and non–small cell lung cancer, where anti–PD-1
antibodies have improved both progression-free and overall
survival (18, 19). Of relevance, systemic immunotherapy with
CPIs can also induce immune-related adverse events (irAE).
Specific ablation of negative regulators of T-cell function on
tumor-reactive T cells used for ACT offers the potential to exploit
the antitumor activity while reducing systemic toxicity.

 Efficient and rapid inactivation of genes in primary antigen-
specific T cells is achievable using the transient expression of
transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) mRNA,
which offers several safety advantages for clinical applications
(20). Using two different mouse models of cancer, we defined the
impact of TALEN-mediated PD-1 gene inactivation in adoptively
transferred tumor-reactive CD4þ and CD8þ T cells. Our data
support a model in which PD-1 gene inactivation increases
persistence of T cells at the tumor site, enhancing tumor control
of B16 melanoma by gp-100-reactive CD8þ T cells and mediating
complete rejection of established MCA205 fibrosarcoma by
endogenous CD4þ and CD8þ T cells. This work demonstrates
both the feasibility and the potential potency of strategies incor-
porating immune checkpoint editing of tumor-reactive T cells
for use in the context of adoptive T-cell therapies for cancer.
Materials and Methods
Mice and cell lines
Six- to 8-week-old pmel-1/SJL TCR-transgenic, C57BL/6, and
C57BL/6-SJL mice were purchased from Charles River Laborato-
ries. All animal use was in accordance with the Home Office
guidelines. The B16.BL6 melanoma cell line was obtained from
Prof. James Allison (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX),
the MCA205 fibrosarcoma cell line was provided by Prof. Guido
Kroemer (Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, South Paris, France),
EL4 thymoma cells were provided by Prof. Henning Walczak
(UCL Cancer Institute, London, United Kingdom), and authen-
tication was performed by the ATCC using short tandem repeat
DNA profiles. The cells were grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented
with 10% FCS,
L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-
Aldrich).
TALEN construction and validation
Three pairs of TALEN targeting the PD-1 murine gene were
produced by Cellectis using the solid phase assembly method
(21). Their activity was evaluated in 5 � 106 EL4 cells, cotrans-
fected with 10 mg of in vitro transcribed mRNA (mMESSAGE
mMACHINE T7 Kit; Ambion) from each half TALEN (Supple-
mentary Fig. S1). Three days after transfection, locus-specific PCRs
were performed on genomic DNA (Supplementary Table S1),
mutations were assessed by mismatches digestion (T7) and Miseq
analysis (20).
Cell culture and adoptive transfer
Splenocytes and lymph nodes cells from pmel-1/SJL transgenic
mice were cultured in complete RPMI with gp100 peptide (Pep-
ceuticals) and rhIL-2 (Preprotech) 100 UI/mL for 24 hours before
selection of CD8þ T cells using the Dynabeads FlowComp Mouse
CD8 Kit. TRL were selected from 100 to 150 mm3 tumors using
Dynabeads FlowComp Mouse Pan T (CD90.2) and maintained in
complete RPMI with rhIL-2 (1,000 UI/mL). A total of 5 � 106
Pmel-1 CD8þ T cells and MCA205 TRL/180 mL of BTX medium T
were mixed with 20 mg of IVT mRNA, before electroporation using
an Agile Pulse BTX system (Harvard Apparatus). C57BL/6 mice
were subcutaneously implanted with either 2.5 � 105 B16 cells or
4 �105 MCA205 cells (day 0). On day 6 for the pmel-1 model and
on day 4 for the MCA205 model, total body irradiation (TBI) was
performed (5 Gy) and 1 � 106 pmel-1 T cells or 1 � 106 MCA205
TRL were adoptively transferred into tumor-bearing mice (n ¼ 5/
group), followed by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of rhIL-2 (1.2
� 106 IU) for 3 days. Mice were sacrificed when the tumors
exceeded 15 mm in diameter. Mice were treated with the anti-
mouse CD8a 2.43–depleting antibody (BioXcell) and the anti-
MCH class II M5/114 (BioXcell), intraperitoneally on day 0, 2, 4,
6, and 8 after ACT (10 mg/kg).
Flow cytometry
Tumors were weighed, digested in Liberase D (Roche) and
mechanically disaggregated through 70-mm filters. Lymph nodes
cells and lymphocytes from tumor samples, enriched on a Ficoll
gradient were incubated with murine antibodies: anti–CD4-V500
(BD Horizon), anti–CD8-BV650, anti–PD-1-PE-Cy7 (Biolegend),
anti–CD45.1-APC-Cy7,
anti–FoxP3-AF700,
anti–IFNg-FITC
(restimulation with gp100-pulsed dendritic cells for pmel cells
or PMA/ionomycin for TRL), anti–KI67-PerCP-eFluor 710, Fix-
able Viability Dye eFluor 450 (eBioscience), anti-FLICA (Vybrant
FAM Poly Caspases Assay Kit; ThermoFisher), Annexin-V–PE
Apoptosis Detection Kit II (BD Pharmingen), Cell Sorting Set-up
Beads (Life Technologies), and anti-human Granzyme B-APC
(Invitrogen) in a blocking solution: 5% mouse serum, 5% rat
serum (Thermo Scientific), 2% FCS, and 2% anti-FcR 2.4G2
(BioXcell). Samples were permeabilized using a Fixation/Permea-
bilization kit (eBioscience), acquired on a LSRII Fortessa and
analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Western blot analysis
Proteins were separated and subjected to the following anti-
bodies: anti-TALEN (1 mg/mL), anti-GAPDH (D16H11; Cell
Signaling Technology; 1:2,000), HRP-coupled secondary anti-
body anti-Rabbit IgG1 HRP-linked (Cell Signaling Technology).
Statistical analysis
One-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, or t tests with P < 0.05
were performed using Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad). Mul-
tiple comparisons were corrected with the Bonferroni coeffi-
cient and Kaplan–Meier survival curves were compared with
the log-rank test.

Results and Discussion
TALEN-mediated PD-1 gene inactivation in melanoma reactive
CD8þ pmel-1 T cells increases persistence of CD8PD-1Ex2 pmel-1
cells at the tumor site
Three pairs of TALENs targeting the murine PD-1 gene were
tested in EL4 cells using an optimized mRNA–electroporation
protocol. Only the pair targeting the exon 2 sequence (Fig. 1A)
caused detectable mismatch-identified mutagenesis (up to 27%)
in the PD-1 gene, correlating with loss of PD-1 expression in up
to 15% of electroporated EL4 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To investigate whether PD-1 inactivation of primary tumor-reac-
tive T cells provided superior antitumor activity against the
poorly immunogenic mouse melanoma B16 model, we used
CD8þ T-cell receptor transgenic (TCR Tg) cells specific to
the melanoma differentiation antigen gp-100 (pmel-1, Supple-
mentary Fig. S2A; ref. 22). In vitro activated pmel-1 T cells
were electroporated with control GFP mRNA (CD8wt) or PD-
1–targeting TALEN mRNA (CD8PD-1Ex2), delivering a high trans-
fection efficiency of >85% as confirmed by GFP expression (Sup-
plementary Fig. S2B). Western blot analysis confirmed transient
TALEN expression one day (d1) after transfection (Fig. 1B) and
Miseq analysis of the targeted sequence showed a high frequency

 of mutations (53% non-homologous end joining, NHEJ; Fig.
1C). Three days after transfection, PD-1–negative cells were
enriched using magnetic beads (Supplementary Fig. S2C)
before ACT of 1 � 106 CD8wt or CD8PD-1Ex2 pmel-1 cells and
rhIL-2 into B16 tumor-bearing mice. Significantly, enhanced
tumor control was consistently observed in mice receiving
CD8PD-1Ex2 cells compared with those treated with CD8wt cells
(Fig. 1D). Six days after transfer in vivo, a significant enrichment
of tumor-infiltrating PD-1–negative pmel-1 cells was observed
in mice treated with CD8PD-1Ex2 T cells (48.2%; Fig. 1E, top),
which contributed to a 2-fold increase in the total number
of tumor-infiltrating pmel-1 cells (Fig. 1E, bottom). In contrast,
the absolute number of T cells in draining lymph nodes
(DLN) was similar between the two groups, suggesting that

 accumulation of CD8PD-1Ex2 T cells at the tumor site was not
due to differences in engraftment nor infiltration from the
DLNs (Supplementary Fig. S2D). Whereas use of RNA and
electroporation to deliver TALENs is compatible with future
clinical translation, it does not allow incorporation of a report-
er gene to distinguish PD-1–edited cells. Nevertheless, the rate
of mutagenesis, investigated ex vivo 7 days after ACT demon-
strates an effective PD-1 gene editing (70%) in the PD-1–
negative fraction from the CD8PD-1Ex2 group (Supplementary
Fig.
S2E).
To
investigate
the
mechanisms
underpinning
enhanced tumor control by pmel-1 cells in the CD8PD-1Ex2
group, we characterized the proliferation and effector function
of CD8wt and CD8PD-1Ex2 T cells in both PD-1þ and PD-1�
tumor-infiltrating pmel-1 populations. Contrary to previous
work suggesting that PD-1 signaling reduces effector activity at
the tumor site (23), no differences were observed in KI67,
granzyme B (GZB), or IFNg expression between PD-1þ and
PD-1� cells. When we compared the adjusted percentages
(percentage of cells in PD-1þ and PD-1� subpopulations) of
tumor-infiltrating KI67þ, GZBþ, and IFNgþ cells, we observed
that the TALEN-induced PD-1 gene inactivation did not impact
the proliferative or functional characteristics of pmel-1 CD8þT
cells in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S2F–S2H). Instead, we con-
sistently observed the appearance of a PD-1� pmel-1 popula-
tion in the CD8PD-1Ex2 group, which contributed to an increase
in the total number of KI67-, GZB-, and IFNg-expressing pmel-1
cells in tumors from mice receiving CD8PD-1Ex2 T cells (Fig. 1F
and G). Together, these data strongly suggest that, in the context

 of ACT, PD-1 expression primarily controls number of tumor-
reactive T cells at the tumor site rather than their proliferative or
functional status.
PD-1 gene inactivation of polyclonal tumor-reactive
lymphocytes promotes persistence of activatedCD4þ and CD8þ
at the tumor site
To define the therapeutic potential and functional impact of
PD-1 gene inactivation in a more physiologically relevant T cell
population, we performed PD-1 gene editing in polyclonal
tumor-reactive lymphocytes (TRL) from C57BL/6SJL mice chal-
lenged with MCA205 cells (24). CD4þ and CD8þ T cells were
isolated from the tumor (TILs) and tumor-draining lymph node
(TDLN) via positive selection. After electroporation of the donor
TRL, we observed a transfection efficiency >65% and we identified
TALEN-induced PD-1 gene mutations by Miseq analysis in 26% of
CD4þ T cells and almost 40% of CD8þ T cells (Supplementary Fig.
S3A and S3B).
In parallel to the generation of the donor mock-transfected
(TRLwt) and PD-1–edited TRL cells (TRLPD-1Ex2), we challenged a
separate group of C57BL/6 mice with MCA205 tumors. Four days
later, tumor-bearing mice were treated with TBI followed by ACT
with TRLwt or TRLPD-1Ex2 cells and rhIL-2. Six days after transfer,
analysis of PD-1 expression on TILs from mice receiving TRLwt or
TRLPD-1EX2 revealed a 15% to 20% average increase in PD-1�
CD4þ and PD-1� CD8þ T cells (Fig. 2A and B). Consistent
with our findings in the TCR Tg model, a significant accumulation
of PD-1� cells was observed only at the tumor site (Fig. 2C;

 Supplementary Fig. S3C). Although PD-1 gene inactivation did
not alter TRL proliferation (KI67) or function (GZB and IFNg;
Supplementary Fig. S3D–S3F), the absolute number of PD1�
TRL–expressing KI67, GZB, and IFNg was significantly higher in
mice receiving TRLPD-1EX2 (Fig. 2D–F).
Given that the increase in the number of PD-1� cells in mice
receiving TRLPD-1EX2 cells was not associated with increased prolif-
eration, we evaluated whether this could be explained by a reduced
rate of PD-1–induced cell death. Using Annexin-V and a fluorescent
caspase substrate kit (FLICA), we observed an overall reduction in
the frequency of intratumoral apoptotic cells in PD-1� compared
with PD-1þ CD4þ and CD8þ T cells (Fig. 3A–D). Whereas we
observed no difference in the frequency of apoptotic cells between
mice treated with TRLwt and TRLPD-1EX2, a significant increase in the
absolute number of Annexin-V� and FLICA� TRLPD-1EX2cells per mg
of tumor was reported (Fig. 3E and F). The data suggest that instead
of increasing T-cell reactivity against tumors, TRLPD-1EX2 cells are
rendered resistant to PD-1–mediated cell death at the tumor site.
PD-1 gene inactivation drives CD4- and CD8-dependent
rejection of established tumors and long-term memory
PD-1 gene inactivation significantly increased the activity of our
ACT protocol (P ¼ 0.0052), and antitumor activity was dependent
on both CD8þ and CD4þ T cells as administration of depleting
anti-CD8 or MHC-II–blocking antibodies ablated antitumor
responses (Fig. 4A and B). No evidence of tumor recurrence was
observed after MCA205 rechallenge on day 50 in mice that had
previously rejected tumors (data not shown). The development of
long-term memory, as demonstrated by protection against a
subsequent tumor challenge, is an important feature of successful
T-cell–adoptive immunotherapy (25). Our data show high levels
of KI67, consistent with high proliferative capacity for both TRL
and TRLPD-1EX2 cells, which also displayed a T-bethi CD62Llow
CD44hi phenotype consistent with effector memory T cells (Sup-
plementary Fig. S4A and S4B; ref. 26). Finally, ex vivo stimulation
of circulating T cells from surviving mice (40 days after tumor
rejection) demonstrated high levels of IFNg production in both
TRL and TRLPD-1EX2 groups arguing against terminal differentia-
tion (Supplementary Fig. S4C; ref. 27).
In summary, our data demonstrate the feasibility and potential
clinical relevance of gene-editing approaches, conferring superior
in vivo activity in the context of adoptive cell therapy protocols. Of
relevance, we observed no evidence of toxicity (weight and
physiologic alterations) after ACT. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first proof-of-concept study illustrating enhancement
and persistence of antitumor responses using targeted genome
editing of primary tumor reactive T cells. Our data indicate that the
primary mechanism by which PD-1 gene inactivation affects
tumor-reactive T cells is by regulating their ability to survive rather
than increasing their activity on a per cell basis, which aligns with
the original description of the role of PD-1 signaling in T-cell
apoptosis (8). Although we investigated PD-1 as the initial proof-
of-concept target, the technology and approach described poten-
tially allow the permanent disruption of other inhibitory check-
points (one or more), considerably advancing the design of the
next generation of cancer immunotherapies.
