Abstract 
Transgenic mouse lines are invaluable tools for neuroscience but as with any technique, care must be 
taken to ensure that the tool itself does not unduly affect the system under study. Here we report 
aberrant electrical activity, similar to interictal spikes, and accompanying fluorescence events in some 
genotypes of transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6 genetically-encoded calcium sensors. These 
epileptiform events have been observed particularly, but not exclusively, in mice with Emx1-Cre and 
Ai93 transgenes, across multiple laboratories. The events occur at >0.1 Hz, are very large in amplitude 
(>1.0 mV local field potentials, >10% df/f widefield imaging signals), and typically cover large regions of 
cortex. Many properties of neuronal responses and behavior seem normal despite these events, though 
rare subjects exhibit overt generalized seizures. The underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon remain 
unclear, but we speculate about possible causes on the basis of diverse observations. We encourage 
researchers to be aware of these activity patterns while interpreting neuronal recordings from affected 
mouse lines and when considering which lines to study.

Introduction 
A paramount goal for neuroscience is the development of technologies that can measure neural activity 
across large regions of the brain with high temporal and spatial resolution. The development of calcium-
sensitive fluorescent proteins has allowed for the minimally-invasive measurement of neuronal activity 
with high signal-to-noise, at single neuron resolution, and on increasingly large spatial scales (Chen et 
al., 2013; Kim et al., 2013; Sofroniew et al., 2016; Stirman et al., 2016). Genetically encoded calcium-
sensitive fluorescent proteins offer a number of advantages over viral expression or bulk injection: the 
experimental procedures can be less invasive; expression levels are more consistent among cells and 
across the subject’s lifetime; and they allow for imaging across wider regions of the brain. Accordingly, 
they have become popular tools and several versions of this technology have been developed, in which 
different versions of the sensor protein are expressed under various promoters (Dana et al., 2014; 
Madisen et al., 2015; Wekselblatt et al., 2016).  
Here we compare the neural activity, measured electrophysiologically and with imaging, from a variety 
of transgenic mouse lines and find that a subset of these lines exhibit aberrant activity patterns 
resembling interictal spikes. Due to this resemblance, discussed further below, we refer to these events 
as “epileptiform”. We describe the characteristics of this activity, its incidence across different mouse 
lines, and speculate about its possible causes.

Results 
“Epileptiform” events in local field potential (LFP) recordings  
We observed highly distinctive, aberrant electrophysiological events in LFP recordings from isocortex of 
some GCaMP-expressing lines. Epileptiform events were seen in all recorded Emx1-Cre;Camk2a-
tTA;Ai93 mice, but not in mice from several other lines, including wild-type C57BL/6J (Figure 1). Events 
were characterized by large amplitude, brief duration, stereotyped shape within a recording, and 
characteristic periodic spacing (“refractory period” of ~0.5 - 1sec, overall rate ~0.1 – 0.5Hz). The 
presence of the events was visualized using a scatter plot of the prominence and width of all negative 
LFP peaks (see Methods). In recordings exhibiting these events, this plot revealed a distinct cluster of 
events of high prominence and short duration, outside the range of variation observed in other 
genotypes. Though the shapes of the events were stereotyped within a recording, they could vary 
significantly across recordings, presumably reflecting differences in the location of the recording site and 
reference relative to the origin and spatial spread of the event at a larger spatial scale (see also imaging 
results, below). These events were larger in amplitude than individual action potentials (>1mV versus 
<750µV), longer in duration (>10ms versus <2ms), and visible over a greater spatial range (>1mm versus 
<100µm), so they cannot reflect the activity of single neurons.  
We tested for epileptiform events in electrophysiological recordings from ten transgenic mice with six 
different combinations of transgenes, plus one wild-type C57BL/6J mouse (Table 1). All tested Emx1-
Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 mice (4/4) showed these events. However, we did not observe these events in 
mice of four other transgenic lines (Slc17a7-Cre;Ai95, Camk2a-tTA;tetO-G6s, Snap25-G6s, and PV-
Cre;Ai32) or in the wild-type mouse. A single recorded Emx1-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai94 mouse showed these 
events, but as this mouse was selected for this recording based on the presence of epileptiform events 
in imaging, their presence in electrophysiology in this mouse does not indicate that all mice of that 
genotype exhibit them. 
Epileptiform events in widefield imaging 
Epileptiform events could also be unambiguously identified with widefield imaging, using the same 
characteristics, i.e. large amplitude and brief duration relative to other events. In an example mouse the 
rate of occurrence, refractory period, relative amplitude, and relative incidence across cortical regions 
were consistent, suggesting that the >1 mV events observed in LFP were the same events identified in 
imaging (Figure 2). This was also true in other mice with non-simultaneous measurements of LFP and 
imaging. We conclude that the large, brief “flashes” observed in imaging correspond to the large, brief 
LFP events. 
By observing the epileptiform events in widefield imaging, we were able to measure the spatial extent of 
the events and to characterize their incidence over a wider range of mice, including multiple genotypes 
and mice from multiple institutions. Widefield data from six more example mice are shown in Figure 3. 
The events were most frequently observed and relatively largest in an antero-lateral region of cortex 
including somatosensory, motor, and frontal cortex. Nevertheless they could on some occasions be 
observed in visual cortex or retrosplenial cortex, usually with lower amplitude and/or relatively 
infrequent occurrence. They were nearly always bilaterally symmetric.

Table 1: Incidence of epileptiform events in electrophysiological 
recordings of local field potentials in cortex. Each count 
represents one mouse recorded electrophysiologically. *The 
Emx1-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai94 mouse was selected for 
electrophysiology on the basis of epileptiform events observed in 
imaging. 
 
 
 
Incidence 
We observed epileptiform events in widefield imaging data from 61 of 138 mice across 15 genotypes 
and four labs (Table 2). These observations were made either using limited windows over restricted 
regions of cortex or, in separate mice, full-hemisphere windows. The incidence of events was greater in 
full-hemisphere recordings for matched genotypes. Considered together with the observations above 
that the epileptiform events often did not travel to visual cortex or had substantially lower amplitude 
there, we infer that they were often undetectable when limited regions of cortex were imaged alone. 
Epileptiform events were seen in the great majority of mice with the Emx1-Cre, Ai93, and either 
Camk2a-tTA or Rosa26-tTA transgenes (31/33 mice with full-hemisphere recordings; 44/59 in total). 
They were also seen in mice that expressed Ai93 with other drivers, and in which germline Cre 
recombination had occurred (15/22 mice with limited-size windows, versus 0/14 in the same lines when 
germline Cre recombination did not occur; Table 3). Germline Cre recombination is the phenomenon 
where ectopic expression of Cre in germline cells of previous generations results in deletion of the Lox-
stop-Lox upstream of the reporter, and thus results in a loss of Cre conditionality in all cells of the animal 
(Schmidt-Supprian and Rajewsky, 2007). In these cases, the GCaMP expression pattern is determined by 
tTA expression alone, regardless of the cell types expressing Cre (Figure 4; in all such cases, tTA 
expression was driven by the Camk2a promoter, resulting in broad and dense expression). In our 
experiments, we observed germline Cre recombination specifically with Emx1-Cre, Ntsr1-Cre, Rbp4-Cre, 
and Rorb-Cre. Although not all mice were tested for germline recombination, we observed a high 
probability of epileptiform events in Emx1-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 mice with Cre conditionality intact (i.e., 
germline Cre recombination had been confirmed absent with genotype tests; 17/19 full-hemisphere 
recordings, 20/31 in total). We therefore conclude that mice with germline Cre recombination have a 
high probability of having epileptiform events for all tested Cre driver lines, but that the Emx1-Cre line is 
a special case in which epileptiform events were common regardless of germline recombination. 
Only three mice with confirmed absence of germline recombination and genotype not including both 
Emx1-Cre and Ai93 were observed to have epileptiform events. Their genotypes were Cux2-Cre;Camk2a-
tTA;Ai93 (1/5 mice recorded with limited-size windows), Emx1-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai94 (1/5 mice overall, 
0/4 with full-hemisphere imaging), and Slc17a7-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 (1/5 mice recorded with full 
hemisphere windows). The other eight genotypes tested had zero observations of these events (0/48 
mice).

1. The two LFP recordings were made simultaneously with each other, but not simultaneously with the widefield imaging. In the 
frontal LFP recording, the two clusters in prominence vs. width arise because of the double-peaked shape of the events in this 
mouse at this site: for some events the width includes only the first peak, for some it includes both.

Detection of epileptiform events in 2-photon imaging 
The epileptiform events were also detectable in 2-photon calcium imaging by creating a trace of the 
mean activity across the entire imaging field of view, including neurons and neuropil. In one mouse we 
measured the neural activity non-simultaneously in all three modalities (LFP, widefield, 2-photon) and 
found the same signatures in all cases (Figure 5). We conclude that epileptiform events can be detected 
in at least some cases when present in the 2-photon field of view. The caveat described above - that 
epileptiform events can be missed when limited fields of view are employed that do not include the 
extent of the events - applies especially to 2-photon imaging experiments with small fields of view, and 
for this reason we have not summarized in detail our observations with 2-photon imaging.

mouse, but not simultaneously. Plot formats as in Figure 1. The genotype of the mouse was Emx1-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai94 
(expressing GCaMP6s). 2-photon trace was generated as the mean intensity of each frame across the entire field of view; 
widefield trace was generated as the mean within an ROI approximating the 2-photon field of view.

Generalized seizures 
We observed generalized, tonic-clonic type seizures in 11 mice at three laboratories, including twice 
during a widefield imaging session. Of these, 10 were Emx1-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 genotype or had 
germline Cre recombination with a different Cre line. These 10 mice comprise a small proportion of the 
total number of such mice that were studied (10/103, 9.7%), but this seizure incidence still represents a 
significant increase relative to other genotypes (1/68, 1.5%; p<0.01, binomial test; the one mouse with a 
reported seizure in this group was Scnn1a-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93). However, mice were not monitored 
constantly in their home cages so these numbers reflect a lower bound on the proportion of mice that 
had seizures.  
Prevention of events with doxycycline treatment 
To test the role of GCaMP6 expression during development, we treated a cohort of Emx1-Cre-
Kess;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 (n=15) and Emx1-Cre-Kess;Camk2a-tTA;Ai94 (n=2) mice with doxycycline from 
birth until aged 7 weeks. Doxycycline blocks tTA activity and therefore prevented expression of GCaMP6 
until removal from the drinking water. GCaMP6 expression levels were low shortly after removal of 
doxycycline and ramped up to levels comparable to untreated Emx1-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 within 3-4 
weeks. Using widefield imaging above S1, we found that all mice treated with doxycycline were free of 
epileptiform events in this brain area up until at least 20 weeks of age, though one mouse did develop 
seizures despite lack of detected events. To compare this to the onset of epileptiform activity in 
untreated mice we performed longitudinal widefield imaging in mice starting at the age of 7 weeks 
(n=2), 8 weeks (n=1) or 11 weeks (n=2). In these mice epileptiform events were not present at 8 weeks 
of age (n=0/3) but developed by the age of 13 weeks (n=5/5 imaged at 13 weeks or greater; Figure 6). 
We conclude that doxycycline treatment delays or reduces the occurrence of epileptiform events.

Discussion 
Here we report the observation of aberrant neural activity resembling interictal spikes in some 
genotypes of transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6. This activity was most prominent in the Emx1-
Cre;Camk2-tTA;Ai93 genotype, or in Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 mice that had undergone germline Cre 
recombination, but was also occasionally observed in other genotypes including one where GCaMP 
expression was driven by the Ai94 rather than Ai93 line.   
These epileptiform events are strikingly distinct from activity observed in unaffected mice, in both 
amplitude and time course. Nevertheless, they can be easy to miss, for several reasons. First, there are 
no obvious behavioral manifestations, other than very rare generalized seizures. Second, the events are 
typically absent in visual cortex, a commonly studied area. Finally, the events may be obscured in 2-
photon imaging, even when present in the field of view, either because the sampling rate is slow relative 
to their duration or because they may primarily appear in neuropil and many individual neurons may 
show little relationship to them (e.g., as shown in Muldoon et al., 2015). 
The presence of this aberrant activity complicates interpretation of studies on such mice. Certainly, 
when aberrant events are present in the recorded neuronal tissue, care must be taken when 
generalizing any conclusions on brain function drawn from these recordings to other mouse genotypes. 
For example, as the epileptiform events were substantially larger than other observed activity, they 
dominate measurements such as response variability and correlations across regions. Furthermore, our 
results suggest that the epileptiform events in these mice may frequently be undetectable in visual 
cortex even though present in other brain regions. In such cases, it is possible that visual cortical activity 
shows more subtle alterations, not revealed by the present analyses.  
Despite the large amplitude of these events, performance in learning and executing trained behavioral 
tasks was not immediately distinguishable between mice with and without them, and visual responses 
were similar to those in wild-type mice, when periods containing aberrant events were excluded (data 
not shown). Tonic-clonic seizures were also rare in these mice. Therefore, it is possible that some 
properties of cortical functional organization may still be measured with imaging in these mice, such as 
receptive field maps (Zhuang et al., 2017). 
Relationship to interictal spikes 
In epileptic patients and animal models, interictal spikes are a commonly observed phenomenon. These 
large, brief electrical events are observable in EEG, ECoG, and intracranial recordings, and are 
considered to always be pathological (Rodin et al., 2009). Whether they merely represent a symptom of 
a damaged brain, actively induce future seizures, or even act preventatively remains disputed (Staley et 
al., 2011). Their exact characteristics vary by species and by variety of epilepsy, but in mice they have 
been defined as having <200ms duration and large amplitude (generally >2x background activity 
amplitude, e.g., Erbayat-Altay et al., 2007). In these ways they are similar to the aberrant events we 
have observed, and we therefore referred to them as “epileptiform”. Furthermore, we observed a small 
proportion of mice to have generalized seizures among the mice with genotypes linked to a high 
incidence of epileptiform events. For these reasons, it seems possible or likely that the events we 
observed are similar or identical in origin to interictal spikes, and that the mice with these events may

indeed be epileptic. To establish this more firmly, one would need 24-hour observation of mice to 
establish seizure incidence, as well as a clearer understanding of the mechanisms underlying the events 
we observed. Note that while the epileptiform events observed here appear similar to interictal spikes, 
they are dissimilar to the spike-wave discharges noted in many rat strains and some mouse models of 
epilepsy, which occur at a much higher rate of 7-9Hz (Wiest and Nicolelis, 2003; Fisher et al., 2014).  
Cause of aberrant activity 
The cause of the epileptiform events is yet unknown and may result from a combination of effects, 
including Cre toxicity, tTA toxicity, and genetic background. Considering all observations together, 
however, the broad expression of GCaMP itself, particularly during development, seems likely to be a 
major factor.  
The Cre enzyme is toxic (Schmidt-Supprian and Rajewsky, 2007) and Emx1-Cre specifically causes 
enhanced seizure susceptibility (Kim et al., 2013). Indeed we did not observe epileptiform events in any 
of the tested mice lacking Cre expression (i.e. Snap25-G6s, Camk2a-tTA;tetO-G6s, and wild type 
C57BL/6J, n=0/19 mice), consistent with a potential contributing role of Cre. However, regarding Emx1-
Cre, we observed the events also in mice with Slc17a7-Cre, Ntsr1-Cre, Rbp4-Cre, and Rorb-Cre, so this 
particular Cre expression pattern cannot alone explain the effects.  
tTA can also be neurotoxic, causing hippocampal degeneration in mice of at least some strains, including 
129X1/SvJ (related to the strain of origin for Ai93 and Ai94, 129S6/SvEvTac, which was not tested; Han 
et al., 2012). In addition to the interaction with tTA toxicity, strain itself might play a role as different 
strains of mice have different seizure susceptibility, and the 129S3/SvImJ strain (again related but not 
identical to the strain of origin for Ai93 and Ai94) has higher seizure susceptibility than some other 
strains including C57BL/6J (Frankel et al., 2001). In general, the mice in this study were not congenic to a 
C57BL/6J background. However, the Rbp4-Cre mice with versus without germline Cre recombination 
have identical genetic backgrounds and identical levels of Cre and tTA, yet show large differences in 
event incidence (also true for Rorb-Cre). This comparison rules out a determining contribution of tTA 
toxicity or genetic background, though the possibility of an interaction remains.  
GCaMP expression itself may play a role in the genesis of the epileptiform events. GCaMP binds calcium 
and thus buffers its intracellular concentration. Calcium plays many important roles in neurons, for 
example in synaptic transmission and in the expression of genes for synaptic plasticity, and disrupting 
these roles may accordingly alter network activity. Consistent with this, some genetic models of epilepsy 
in mice result from mutations to calcium channels (Letts et al., 1998). A major (if not the only) difference 
between the Rbp4-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 mice with versus without germline Cre recombination is that 
the former will express GCaMP in a larger subset of neurons and possibly at higher levels than the latter, 
and the major difference in event incidence between these two groups of subjects (also true for Rorb-
Cre) strongly suggests that the GCaMP expression itself plays a role.  
Finally, we tested the role of GCaMP expression during development by suppressing tTA activity with 
doxycycline until 7 weeks postnatal in a cohort of mice. This treatment was effective in eliminating 
epileptiform events while preserving high expression levels in adulthood. Since expression of GCaMP in 
Ai93 depends on tTA activity, this manipulation should have prevented GCaMP expression during

development, even though doxy-treated mice expressed the same levels of Cre and shared the same 
genetic background as controls. These experiments suggest that broad expression of GCaMP during 
development is a major contributing factor to epileptiform activity. 
Taken together, these data suggest that a dominant role may be played by GCaMP6 expression itself, 
perhaps specifically during development. Cre toxicity, tTA toxicity, and/or genetic background, may 
contribute, but appear unlikely to be determining factors. Whether the GCaMP expression is deleterious 
only when expressed in certain cell types or brain regions, whether it is deleterious only at certain 
restricted epochs in development, and whether different versions of the sensor have different severities 
of effects all remain unknown. 
Available alternative tools 
For researchers wishing to pursue experiments with transgenic GCaMP6-expressing mice, some 
alternatives are available. Pan-excitatory expression with the GCaMP6F sensor can be accomplished 
with Ai93 using Slc17a7-Cre as an alternative to Emx1-Cre, or with Slc17a7-Cre;Ai95 (with lower 
expression levels). For the GCaMP6s sensor, the Camk2a-tTA;tetO-GCaMP6s mice (Wekselblatt et al., 
2016) have expression levels comparable to Emx1-C re;Camk2a-tTA;Ai94 and have so far (n=12 overall; 
n=8 with full-hemisphere windows) not been observed to have epileptiform events in our hands.  
Notes of caution 
Breeding strategies must take into account the possibility of germline Cre recombination, or else 
consistent and careful checks must be made to ensure that it has not occurred. This can generally be 
avoided by excluding females that are positive for both Cre and the loxP-flanked allele from breeding 
pairs. It can be tested for directly by genotyping or by observation, e.g., in the present study, mice 
negative for Emx1-Cre but positive for Camk2a-tTA and Ai93 (littermates of those positive for all three) 
would still express GCaMP when germline Cre recombination has occurred.  
Finally, though we have identified several lines with apparently normal electrophysiological activity, 
these mice nevertheless also express the same calcium-buffering proteins and at least one of Cre and 
tTA. Since a full, precise definition of “normal” and “abnormal” electrophysiological activity is 
unavailable it is impossible to determine whether all activity in these mice is fully normal. We therefore 
suggest that confirming observations with multiple techniques – using both transgenic and wild-type 
mice – is an important experimental control whenever possible.

Electrophysiology 
Electrophysiological recordings were performed at the Carandini/Harris Laboratory (UCL) and were 
conducted according to the UK Animals Scientific Procedures Act (1986) and under personal and project 
licenses released by the Home Office following appropriate ethics review. To prepare for 
electrophysiological recordings, mice were anesthetized briefly (<1 hr) and a small craniotomy was 
drilled over the site of interest. The craniotomy was covered with Kwik-Cast elastomer for protection 
and the mouse was allowed to recover. After several hours’ recovery, or over the subsequent several 
days, mice were head-fixed in the experimental apparatus. The kwik-cast was removed and saline-based 
agar was applied over the craniotomy. The agar was covered with silicon oil to prevent drying. 
Recordings were performed with custom multi-site silicon electrode arrays, inserted through the agar 
and through the dura. Signals were referenced to an external Ag/AgCl wire placed in the agar near the 
craniotomy. This external reference was shorted to the amplifier ground. LFP signals were low-pass 
filtered in hardware with a single-pole filter at 300Hz and recorded to disk at 2.5kHz. Subjects were 
awake and standing passively on a stationary platform. During the analyzed periods, subjects either 
viewed a “sparse noise” visual stimulus (8-degree width white squares on a black background, at 
random times and positions) or no visual stimulus. A single channel from those in cortex was selected 
manually to be representative for further analysis.  
Widefield imaging 
At the Carandini/Harris Laboratory (UCL), widefield imaging was performed through the intact skull with 
a clear skull cap implanted. The clear skull cap implantation followed the method of Guo et al. (2014) 
but with some modifications. In brief, the dorsal surface of the skull was cleared of skin and periosteum 
and prepared with a brief application of green activator (Super-Bond C&B, Sun Medical Co, Ltd, Japan). A 
3D-printed light-isolation cone surrounding the frontal and parietal bones was attached to the skull with 
cyanoacrylate (VetBond; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and the gaps between the cone and 
the skull were filled with L-type radiopaque polymer (Super-Bond C&B). A thin layer of cyanoacrylate 
was applied to the skull inside the cone and allowed to dry. Thin layers of UV-curing optical glue 
(Norland Optical Adhesives #81, Norland Products Inc., Cranbury, NJ) were applied inside the cone and 
cured until the exposed skull was covered. A headplate was attached to the skull over the interparietal 
bone with Super-Bond polymer, and more polymer was applied around the headplate and cone. Imaging 
was conducted at 35Hz with ~10ms exposures and 2x2 binning using a PCO Edge 5.5 CMOS camera and 
a macroscope (Scimedia THT-FLSP) with 1.0x condenser lens (Leica 10450028) and 0.63x objective lens 
(Leica 10450027). Illumination was by 470nm LED (Cairn OptoLED, P1110/002/000). Illumination light 
passed through an excitation filter (Semrock FF01-466/40-25), a dichroic (425nm; Chroma T425lpxr), 
and 3mm-core optical fiber (Cairn P135/015/003), then reflected off another dichroic (495nm; Semrock 
FF495-Di03-50x70) to the brain. Emitted light passed through the second dichroic and emission filter 
(Edmunds 525/50-55 (86-963)) to the camera. Data were compressed by computing the singular value 
decomposition of the 3D image stack, and individual pixel traces were reconstructed for analysis from 
the top 500 singular values.

At the Häusser Laboratory (UCL) all surgical procedures were carried out under a license from the UK 
Home Office in accordance with the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Emx1-Cre-Kess;Camk2a-
tTA;Ai93 mice and Emx1-Cre-Kess;Camk2a-tTA;Ai94 mice, between 6 and 17 weeks old, were 
anaesthetised using Isoflurane (0.5-1%). A metal headplate with a 5mm circular imaging well was fixed 
to the skull overlying somatosensory cortex with dental acryclic (Super-Bond C&B, Sun-Medical). A 
craniotomy was drilled above S1 (right hemisphere, 2mm posterior and 3.5mm lateral of bregma). A 
cranial window, composed of a 3mm circular glass coverslip glued to a 2mm square glass with UV-
curable optical cement (NOR-61, Norland Optical Adhesive) was press-fit into the craniotomy and sealed 
using Vetbond before fixing it with dental acrylic. After at least 1 week and up to 7 month later widefield 
imaging was performed at 15Hz using a 470nm LED (Thorlabs, M470L3) to illuminate the area. All except 
for the first imaging session of cb71-96) were done using an ORCA-Flash 4.0 V3 (Hamamatsu) camera 
and a 4x objective (4x Nikon Plan Fluorite Imaging Objective, 0.13 NA, 17.2 mm WD). Excitation light 
passed through an aspheric condenser lens (Thorlabs, ACL2520U-DG15), a filter (Chroma ET470/40) and 
was reflected into the lightpath by a 495nm longpass dichroic (Semrock, FF495-Di03-25x36) to reach the 
brain. Emitted light passed through the same 495nm longpass dichroic as well as a 749nm shortpass 
dichroic (Semrock, FF749SDi01-25x36x3) and an emission filter (Chroma HQ525/50) before reaching the 
camera. Spontaneous activity of awake mice running freely on a treadmill was acquired for 2-4 minutes. 
Only the first imaging session of cb71-96 was done using a Manta G609 camera (Allied Vision) and a 
50mm f/2.0 Ci Series fixed focal length lens (Edmund optics). Calcium signal time series were obtained 
from the average pixel intensity. 
At the Margolis Laboratory (Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey), widefield imaging was 
performed through the intact skull that was rendered transparent using methods similar to those 
described previously (Lee and Margolis, 2016). All procedures were carried out with the approval of the 
Rutgers University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were anesthetized with 
isoflurane (3% induction and 1.5% maintenance) in 100% oxygen, placed on a thermostatically 
controlled heating blanket (FHC) at 36℃ and mounted in a sterotaxic frame (Stoelting). The scalp was 
sterilized with betadine scrub and infiltrated with bupivacaine (0.25%) prior to incision. The scalp was 
reflected and the underlying skull was lightly scraped to detach muscle and periosteum and irrigated 
with sterile 0.9% saline. The skull was made transparent by applying a light-curable bonding agent 
(iBond Total Etch, Heraeus Kulzer International) followed by a transparent dental composite (Tetric 
Evoflow, Ivoclar Vivadent). A custom aluminum headpost was cemented to the right side of the skull and 
the transparent portion of the skull was surrounded by a raised border constructed using another dental 
composite (Charisma, Heraeus Kulzer International). Mice were given carprofen (5 mg/kg) 
postoperatively. Following a recovery period of at least one week, mice were acclimated to handling and 
head fixation for an additional week prior to imaging. Mice were housed on a reversed light cycle and all 
handling and imaging took place during the dark phase of the cycle. For imaging, mice were head fixed 
and the transparent skull was covered with glycerol and a glass coverslip. Imaging was carried out using 
a custom macroscope that allowed for simultaneous imaging of nearly the entire left hemisphere and 
medial portions of the right hemisphere. The cortex was illuminated with 460 nm LED (Aculed VHL) 
powered by a Prizmatix current controller (BLCC-2). Excitation light passed through a filter (479/40; 
Semrock FF01-479/40-25) and was reflected by a dichroic mirror (Linos DC-Blue G38 1323 036) through

the objective lens (Navitar 25 mm / f0.95 lens, inverted). GCaMP6f fluorescence (535/40; Chroma 
D535/40m emission filter) was acquired with a MiCam Ultima CMOS camera (Brainvision) fitted with a 
50 mm / f0.95 lens (Navitar). The resulting 100 x 100 pixel image corresponded to an imaging area of ~6 
x 6 mm. Spontaneous activity was acquired in 20.47 s recordings at 100 frames per second with 20 s 
between recordings. Sixteen movies were acquired in each session. Changes in GCaMP6f relative 
fluorescence were calculated by subtracting the baseline, defined as the average intensity per pixel in 
the first 30 or 49 images, from each frame within a movie and then dividing each frame by the same 
baseline. Calcium signal time series were obtained from the average intensity in 5 by 5 pixel regions of 
interest. 
At the Allen Institute for Brain Science, widefield imaging was performed either through the intact skull 
using a modification of the method from Silasi et al. (2016), or through a 5 mm diameter chronically 
implanted cranial window centered over the left visual cortex (Andermann et al., 2010; Zhuang et al., 
2017). For through-skull imaging, the skull was exposed and cleared of periosteum and a #1.5 
borosilicate coverslip (Electron Microscopy Sciences, #72204-01) was fixed to the skull surface by a layer 
of clear cement (C&B Metabond, Sun Medical Co, Ltd, Japan).  A 3d printed light-shield was fixed around 
the coverslip using additional Metabond, and the outward-facing surfaces were coated with an opaque 
resin (Lang dental Jetliquid, MediMark, Grenoble, France).  Mice with chronically implanted windows 
received a 5 mm diameter craniotomy over the left hemisphere, centered at 2.7 mm lateral and 1.3 mm 
anterior to lambda. The craniotomy was sealed with a stack of three #1 coverslips, attached to each 
other using optical adhesive (Norland) and to the skull with Metabond. The window provided optical 
access to the left visual cortex, the posterior aspect of somatosensory cortex and medial aspect of dorsal 
retrosplenial cortex. In both cases, a custom-manufactured titanium headpost was fixed posterior to the 
lightshield/coverslip and dorsal to the cerebellum using Metabond. All surgical procedures were 
performed under isoflurane anesthesia and were approved by the Allen Institute Animal Care and Use 
Committee. Image acquisition used a Hamamatsu Flash4.0 v2 sCMOS camera running at half resolution 
(1024x1024) with a 10ms rolling exposure (100Hz). Images were produced by a tandem-lens 
macroscope (Scimedia THT-FLSP) with 1.0x tube and objective lenses (Leica 10450028) for through skull 
imaging, or a 1.0x tube lens paired to a 1.6x objective lens (Leica 10450029) for imaging through the 
chronically implanted window. Epifluorescence illumination used a 470 nm LED (Thorlabs M470L3) 
filtered (Semrock FF01-474/27-50) and reflected by a dichroic mirror (Semrock FF495-Di03-50x70) 
through the objective lens. Fluorescence emission passed through a filter (Semrock FF01-525/45-50) to 
the camera. Data were spatially downsampled 16x by averaging, and calcium traces were obtained by 
subtracting and then dividing each pixel by its mean over the whole time series. 
2-photon imaging 
The subject (Emx1-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai94, Figure 4) was implanted, the Carandini/Harris Laboratory 
(UCL), with a 4mm-diameter glass window over visual, retrosplenial, and somatosensory cortices. Two-
photon imaging was performed using a standard resonant B-Scope microscope (Thorlabs) equipped with 
a Nikon 16x, 0.8NA water immersion objective, and controlled by ScanImage 4.2 (Pologruto et al., 2003). 
Excitation light was provided at a wavelength of 970-980 nm through a tunable Ti:Sapphire laser 
(Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent). A custom light-isolation cylinder was placed around the imaging

objective. Imaging was conducted at 30Hz with a 500µm-wide field of view in superficial layers (depth 
~200µm) of somatosensory cortex (a site determined to show epileptiform events in widefield imaging 
previously). To extract a trace for detection of epileptiform events, all pixels from each frame were 
averaged together across the entire field of view (in MATLAB: 
squeeze(mean(mean(imstack,1),2)); where imstack is a 3D matrix of size nXpixels x 
nYpixels x nFrames).  
Doxycline treatment  
Mice treated with doxycycline were administered doxycycline orally via the drinking water. A solution of 
5 % sucrose and 2 mg/ml doxycycline in tap water was given as drinking water from birth up until 7 
weeks of age. Treated and untreated animals were imaged as described above (Widefield imaging in the 
Häusser laboratory). 
Testing for Cre-mediated Lox-STOP-Lox recombination in the germline 
Mouse DNA was purified from 25 mg tail snips using Macherey-Nagel NucleoSpin Tissue 96 protocol 
adapted for the QIAgen QIAcube HT platform, yielding DNA concentrations between 15-60 ng/µL as 
measured by SpectraMax UV Spectrophotometer. Genotyping PCR reaction was performed using 
primers MG-2333 (5’gctcgtttagtgaaccgtca 3’), MG-1099 (5’ tagccatggtgctgaggggatct 3’), MG-2054 (5’ 
acagatcccgacccatttgctgt 3’).  Amplification was performed in a 50 µL reaction volume and consisting of 
9.5 µL nuclease free water, 25 µL Taq master mix, 4.5 µL each primer at 10 µM working concentration, 
and 2 µL template, and with the following PCR program: 3 min at 95 °C for initial denaturation, followed 
by 45 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 90 s at 72 °C, and completed with 10 min at 72 °C. PCR 
products were visualized by capillary electrophoresis using the Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer 
dsDNA 910 protocol. PCR product size of 119 bp corresponds to intact LSL cassette, PCR product size of 
183 bp corresponds to LSL deletion. We observed low-level amplification of 183 bp product in some 
samples likely due to Cre-mediated recombination in tail tissue. All germline LSL deletion events were 
observed as complete absence of the 119 bp band. 
Data analysis 
Traces were analyzed by finding peaks and computing two parameters from them: prominence and full-
width at half-prominence. Prominence is defined as the height of the peak relative to the greater of the 
two minima between the peak and its surrounding two higher peaks (or beginning/end of trace if no 
higher peak). Peak detection and calculation of these two parameters can be accomplished with the 
“findpeaks” function in MATLAB: 
[peakValues,peakLocations,widths,prominences] = findpeaks(signal, t);
