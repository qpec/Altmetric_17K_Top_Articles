Summary
Background Maternal and neonatal mortality is high in Africa, but few large, prospective studies have been done to 
investigate the risk factors associated with these poor maternal and neonatal outcomes. 
Methods A 7-day, international, prospective, observational cohort study was done in patients having caesarean delivery 
in 183 hospitals across 22 countries in Africa. The inclusion criteria were all consecutive patients (aged ≥18 years) 
admitted to participating centres having elective and non-elective caesarean delivery during the 7-day study cohort 
period. To ensure a representative sample, each hospital had to provide data for 90% of the eligible patients during the 
recruitment week. The primary outcome was in-hospital maternal mortality and complications, which were assessed 
by local investigators. The study was registered on the South African National Health Research Database, number 
KZ_2015RP7_22, and on ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03044899. 
Findings Between February, 2016, and May, 2016, 3792 patients were recruited from hospitals across Africa. 3685 were 
included in the postoperative complications analysis (107 missing data) and 3684 were included in the maternal mortality 
analysis (108 missing data). These hospitals had a combined number of specialist surgeons, obstetricians, and 
anaesthetists totalling 0·7 per 100 000 population (IQR 0·2–2·0). Maternal mortality was 20 (0·5%) of 3684 patients 
(95% CI 0·3–0·8). Complications occurred in 633 (17·4%) of 3636 mothers (16·2–18·6), which were predominantly 
severe intraoperative and postoperative bleeding (136 [3·8%] of 3612 mothers). Maternal mortality was independently 
associated with a preoperative presentation of placenta praevia, placental abruption, ruptured uterus, antepartum 
haemorrhage (odds ratio 4·47 [95% CI 1·46–13·65]), and perioperative severe obstetric haemorrhage (5·87 [1·99–17·34]) 
or anaesthesia complications (11·47 (1·20–109·20]). Neonatal mortality was 153 (4·4%) of 3506  infants (95% CI 3·7–5·0).
Interpretation Maternal mortality after caesarean delivery in Africa is 50 times higher than that of high-income 
countries and is driven by peripartum haemorrhage and anaesthesia complications. Neonatal mortality is double the 
global average. Early identification and appropriate management of mothers at risk of peripartum haemorrhage 
might improve maternal and neonatal outcomes in Africa.

Introduction
Africa’s population has the highest growth rate in 
the world and is estimated to exceed 1·7 billion people 
by 2030.1 Mothers and their children continue to die 
at an unacceptable rate in Africa. Two-thirds of the 
global maternal deaths in 2015 occurred in sub-Saharan 
Africa,2 and the maternal mortality ratio is estimated 
to be more than double the global average of 
546 maternal deaths per 100 000 livebirths.2 The neonatal 
mortality rate is also highest in sub-Saharan Africa 
(28 per 1000 livebirths) compared with the global 
average of 19 per 1000 livebirths.3 These maternal and 
neonatal figures are far removed from the Sustainable 
Development Goals for 2030 of a maternal mortality 
ratio of less than 70 deaths per 100 000 livebirths and 
neonatal mortality rate less than 12 deaths per 
1000 livebirths.3,4
Caesarean delivery is one of the Bellwether procedures 
of the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery,5 yet in 
Africa both the safety of this procedure and access to 
caesarean deliveries are poor. Although some middle-
income countries are seeking to lower their caesarean 
delivery rates, countries with a caesarean delivery rate of 
less than 19 per 100 livebirths (which is characteristic 
of most African countries) are associated with a sig-
nificantly increased maternal and neonatal mortality.6

care providers of lower levels9 (ie, who are non-
physicians) might all contribute to maternal and neo-
natal mortality in low-income and middle-income 
countries. To improve caesarean delivery safety in 
Africa, and to simultaneously improve maternal and 
neonatal outcomes, robust patient and outcomes data 
are required. Furthermore, to design effective inter-
ventional strategies to reduce morbidity associated with 
caesarean delivery, an understanding of the risk factors 
associated with maternal and neonatal mortality is 
necessary.6,10,11 Unfortunately, it is impossible to achieve 
these objectives with the current data, which is modelled 
on predominantly retrospective or small datasets and 
mostly addresses mortality alone.
To address these limitations, we did a preplanned, 
prospective, observational substudy of adult patients 
having caesarean delivery within the African Surgical 
Outcomes Study (ASOS).12 We hypothesised that obstetric 
outcomes are worse in Africa than in high-income 
countries.
Methods
Study design and participants
This obstetric substudy was a planned study of ASOS, a 
7-day African, national, multicentre, prospective, obser-
vational cohort study of all patients (≥18 years) having 
in-patient surgery. Patients were recruited from 183 hos 
-
pitals across 22 countries in Africa. These included 
12 low-income countries (Benin [n=9], Burundi [n=6], 
Republic of the Congo [n=1], Democratic Republic of the 
Congo [n=16], Ethiopia [n=2], The Gambia [n=5], 
Madagascar [n=6], Mali [n=9], Niger [n=1], Tanzania [n=3], 
Uganda [n=8], Zimbabwe [n=19]) and ten middle-income 
countries (Algeria [n=2], Cameroon [n=5], Ghana [n=2], 
Kenya [n=5], Libya [n=6], Mauritius [n=6], Namibia [n=15], 
Nigeria [n=10], South Africa [n=44], Zambia [n=3]). 
ASOS was done by a collaborative research network 
of over 1000 research clinicians from across Africa.12 
We sought to recruit as many centres as possible from 
each

Research in context
Evidence before this study
African maternal and neonatal mortality rates are unacceptably 
high. The maternal mortality ratio in sub-Saharan Africa is 
estimated to be more than double the global average at 
546 maternal deaths per 100 000 livebirths. Sub-Saharan Africa 
also has the highest neonatal mortality rate in the world at 
28 deaths per 1000 livebirths. These outcomes are compounded 
by a lack of global focus on surgical care, something that has 
been largely ignored until the publication of the Lancet 
Commission on Global Surgery in 2015. Caesarean delivery is a 
Bellwether procedure of the Lancet  Commission, yet few people 
have access to caesarean deliveries in Africa. Maternal and 
neonatal mortality increases significantly in countries where the 
caesarean delivery rate is less than 19 per 100 livebirths, which is 
the case for almost every country in Africa. Additionally, existing 
data are derived from complex modelling analyses of 
predominantly small or retrospectively collected datasets and do 
not describe the effect of baseline maternal comorbidities and 
perioperative complications on poor maternal and neonatal 
outcomes after caesarean delivery in Africa. The Sustainable 
Development Goal (SDG)’s target 3.1 is to reduce the global 
maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100 000 livebirths by 
the year 2030, with no country exceeding 140. This goal 
currently appears unachievable in most African countries. To 
work towards the SDG for maternal mortality ratio in Africa, 
more robust data are needed that describe the association 
between maternal risk factors and perioperative complications 
and subsequent maternal and neonatal outcomes. 
Added value of this study
This obstetric substudy of the African Surgical Outcomes Study 
provides caesarean delivery data from 22 African countries. As a 
result of poor access to health care, mothers present for 
caesarean delivery with a high baseline preoperative risk; one in 
eight mothers have pre-eclampsia or eclampsia and one in 17 
have a major risk of perioperative bleeding. A quarter of all 
anaesthetics are administered by non-physician anaesthesia 
providers. One in eight women will develop a perioperative 
complication, most frequently post-partum haemorrhage. One 
in four maternal deaths happen after severe obstetric 
haemorrhage and one in ten happen after anaesthesia 
complications. The result is that mothers in Africa are 50 times 
more likely to die after caesarean delivery than mothers in 
high-income countries. The neonatal mortality rate after 
caesarean delivery is also high at 44 per 1000 livebirths. The 
prognosis for neonates who survive is also poor. It is estimated 
that the incidence of subsequent cerebral palsy and epilepsy is 
2–11 times higher than Sweden.
Implications of all the available evidence
Previous studies have provided only a small amount of data on 
risk factors and associated maternal and neonatal outcomes 
after caesarean delivery in Africa. Our findings suggest that the 
maternal and neonatal mortality in Africa is substantially 
higher than previously estimated. Obstetric haemorrhage and 
anaesthesia complications are associated with maternal death. 
The outcome of mothers and neonates in Africa might be 
improved by early identification of mothers at risk of obstetric 
haemorrhage, ensuring an appropriate level of care for high-
risk obstetric patients and early and appropriate management 
of peripartum haemorrhage. Improvement of surgical 
outcomes could have a substantial effect on both maternal and 
neonatal mortality and could have an effect on stillbirth rates, 
with key global health gains. Our findings will potentially 
enable targeted, context-sensitive interventions aimed at 
reducing these negative outcomes.

hospital, we required each hospital’s lead investigator to 
submit the total number of eligible patients during the 
recruitment week and required that each partici 
pating 
hospital provide complete data for at least 90% of the 
eligible surgical patients during the recruitment week.
At the discretion of the ASOS national leader, each 
country selected a single recruitment week for the study 
between February, 2016, and May, 2016. The inclusion 
criteria were all consecutive patients (aged ≥18 years) 
admitted to participating centres having elective and non-
elective caesarean delivery during the 7-day study cohort 
period. Preoperative recruitment and follow-up until 
discharge was performed by local investigators. The study 
was censored at 30 days postoperatively for patients who 
were still in hospital. Hospital-specific data were also 
collected: number of hospital beds, number of operating 
rooms, number of critical-care beds, and numbers of 
anaesthesiologists and obstetricians working in the 
hospital.
Regulatory approval varied between countries, with 
some requiring ethics approval and others requiring only 
data regulatory approval. The primary ethics approval was 
from the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of the 
University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (BE306/15). 
All sites approved a waiver of consent, with the exception 
of the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, 
which required informed consent from all patients, with 
the option of deferred consent for patients unable to give 
consent before surgery.
Procedures
We adopted the International Surgical Outcomes Study 
(ISOS) definitions, with minor changes, to provide data 
on surgical outcomes that are internationally consistent 
with the ISOS publication.13,14 The definition and grading 
of complications were according to the European Peri-
operative Clinical Outcome definitions.13 We collected 
the same potential risk factors as ISOS for in-hospital 
mortality and postoperative complications. An obstetric-
specific case report form was added to the ASOS dataset 
for the obstetric substudy (appendix p 19), which 
included substudy specific data: history of pre-eclampsia, 
eclampsia, cardiac disease, placenta praevia, placental 
abruption, ruptured uterus, sepsis and ante 
partum 
haemorrhage; gravidity and parity, gestational age, fetal 
distress, and neonatal outcomes (1 and 5 min Apgar 
scores, need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation after 
delivery, and neonatal in-hospital mortality censored at 
30 days). To ensure consistency in data definitions 
and interpretation, the data definition file used for ISOS 
was adopted for ASOS.13 The corresponding author 
(BMB) made country visits where possible to meet with 
local study investigators. A website provided educational 
support and the webpage with frequently asked 
questions was updated regularly. The protocol and case 
report forms for the study were available in English and 
French on the study website.
Data were collected on paper case report forms and 
were pseudoanonymised—ie, unique numerical codes 
were generated during transcription of data onto an 
internet-based electronic case report form. Soft limits 
were set for data entry, prompting investigators when 
data were entered outside these limits. Each patient could 
only be identified on the electronic case report forms by 
their numerical code and thus the coordinating study 
team could not trace data back to an individual patient 
without contact with the gate-keeper investigator at the 
site. Access to the data entry system was user name and 
password protected. All electronic data transfers between 
participating hospitals and the coordinating centre were 
encrypted with the use of a secure protocol. This study is 
reported according to the STROBE statement.15 The 
national leaders confirmed the face validity of the 
unadjusted outcome data for their countries.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was in-hospital maternal mortality 
and complications. The secondary objectives were to 
describe preoperative maternal risk factors associated 
with maternal mortality, perioperative complications 
associated with maternal mortality, in-hospital neonatal 
mortality, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation and Apgar 
scores associated with neonatal mortality.
Statistical analysis
We described categorical variables as proportions and 
compared them using χ² tests and Fisher’s exact tests as 
appropriate. We described continuous variables as mean 
(SD) or median (IQR) and compared using t tests or 
Mann-Whitney U tests as appropriate. We performed 
univariate analyses and binary logistic regression models 
to assess the risk factors for maternal and neonatal 
mortality. We assessed collinearity between potential risk 
predictors by identification of a variance inflation factor; 
we excluded risk predictors with a variance inflation 
factor of more than 2.
We wrote a statistical analysis plan for the ASOS obstetric 
substudy before data inspection and analysis. We expected 
a sample size of approximately 3000–4000 obstetric 
patients, with an expected maternal and neonatal mortality 
of between 0·5% and 1%. Therefore, to ensure that we 
fulfilled the criteria for a minimum of five to ten events per 
variable to construct acceptably reliable logistic regression 
models for maternal and neonatal mortality,16 we planned 
models in which to enter risk factors: a preoperative 
maternal mortality risk model, a perioperative compli-
cations and maternal mortality model, and the neonatal 
mortality model. Based on the small number of risk factors 
to be entered into the models, we made an a-priori decision 
to assess risk factors based on clinical plausibility and our 
understanding of their potential association with maternal 
or neonatal mortality. For the maternal mortality models 
the preoperative risk factors included were pre-eclampsia 
or eclampsia,17 major bleeding risk,8 any chronic medical

condition, and preoperative sepsis, and the perioperative 
complications included were severe infections,12,17 severe 
cardiac complications,7 severe obstetric haemorrhage,11 and 
anaesthesia complications (appendix p 23).9 For the 
neonatal mortality model, our a-priori decision was to 
include three neonatal risk factors based on the American 
Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on neonatal encephal-
opathy,18 two Apgar scores (<7 at 1 min, and <5 at 5 min), 
and the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We 
assessed two models on the basis of a gestational age of 
35 weeks or less and more than 35 weeks. We calculated 
the average population attributable risk for the independent 
risk factors associated with maternal mortality.19 We 
planned no prespecified subgroup analyses.
For all analyses, we performed a complete case analysis 
in which patients with missing data were excluded from 
an analysis. To control for potential bias with under-
reporting of poor outcomes, we conducted sensitivity 
analyses for both maternal and neonatal mortality using 
data from hospitals that provided a representative 
sample, based on inclusion of least 90% of the eligible 
surgical patients during the recruitment week, and 
protocol compliant countries. We did further sensitivity 
analyses, which controlled for country and hospital 
clusters. To control for the effect of the level of hospital, 
and the level of the health-care provider on maternal and 
neonatal outcomes, we entered these risk factors into 
the logistic regressions. We did further sensitivity 
analyses 
to 
investigate 
the 
association 
between 
gestational age and the level of anaesthesia providers 
and surgical providers on maternal outcomes by forcing 
these variables into the logistic regression models. We 
report results as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% CI. 
p<0·05 was considered statistically significant. We did 
statistical analyses using the Statistical Package for the 
Social Sciences (SPSS), version 24 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, 
USA). We used RStudio statistical software package 
version 1.1.442 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 
Boston, USA) to compute the population attributable 
risks.
The study was registered on the South African National 
Health Research Database (KZ_2015RP7_22), and on 
ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03044899).
Role of the funding source
The study was funded by a self-initiated research grant 
from the Medical Research Council of South Africa 
awarded to BMB. The study website and data repository 
were maintained by Safe Surgery South Africa and the 
South African Society of Anaesthesiologists, who had no 
role in the study design, data acquisition, data analysis, 
or writing of the paper. The corresponding author had 
full access to all the data in the study and had final 
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. 
Results
183 hospitals from 22 African countries participated in 
the ASOS obstetric substudy. Eleven of the countries 
(Democratic Republic of Congo, The Gambia, Madagascar, 
Mali, Mauritius, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, South Africa, 
Uganda, and Zimbabwe) provided data on more than 
90% of the surgeries, in keeping with the study definition.
Hospital-specific data for the obstetric substudy were 
submitted for 173 (95%) of 183 hospitals, of which 
139 (80%) were government-funded hospitals, 22 (13%) 
were privately funded, and 12 (7%) were jointly funded 
hospitals. 77 (46%) of 169 hospitals were university-
affiliated. 39 (23%) of 173 were district hospitals, 
58 (34%) were regional hospitals, 34 (20%) were central 
hospitals, and 42 (24%) were specialised hospitals. 
These hospitals (n=154) served a median population of 
860 000 (IQR 265 317–2 000 000) people. Participating 
hospitals had a median of 339 beds (154–540), six 
operating rooms (2–7), and four critical care beds (1–7), 
allowing invasive ventilation. The median ratio of 
critical care beds allowing invasive ventilation to 
hospital beds was 2·3% (0·2–4·6). The hospitals were 
staffed by a median of three specialist surgeons (1–9),

ASOS recruited 11 422 patients, 3792 (33·2%) of whom 
had caesarean delivery (figure 1). 13 (7%) of 183 hospitals 
did not provide data on more than 90% of the eligible 
patients for inclusion in the study during the recruitment 
week, equating to 255 [6·7%] of 3792 patients.
450 (12·2%) of 3685 mothers presented with pre-
eclampsia or eclampsia, of whom one in five presented 
with eclampsia (table 1). 216 (5·9%) of 3685 mothers 
presented with a major preoperative bleeding risk, 
defined as placenta praevia (57 [26%]), placental abruption 
(79 [36%]), ruptured uterus (29 [13%]), and antepartum 
haemorrhage (77 [36%]). 26 women has more than one

In-hospital mortality data was missing in 108 (2·8%) of 
3792 patients. The caesarean delivery maternal mortality 
was 20 (0·5%) of 3684 patients (95% CI 0·3–0·8), with 
a maternal mortality of 543 per 100 000 operations 
(5·43 per 1000; appendix p 24). Mothers who died after 
caesarean delivery were of a higher parity and had a 
significantly higher preoperative comorbidity, reflected by 
higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 
categories and a higher major bleeding risk. Mothers who 
died were more likely to have received general anaesthesia 
for delivery (table 1). Maternal mortality was similar 
between mothers of a gestation of 35 weeks or less or more 
than 35 weeks (3 [1%] of 346 vs 15 [0·5%] 3116; p=0·344).
Postoperative complications after caesarean delivery 
were reported in 633 (17·4%) of 3636 mothers 
(95% CI 16·2–18·6; table 2). The most common severe 
com 
plications were intraoperative and postoperative 
bleeding, reported in 136 (3·8%) of 3612 mothers. 14 (2%) 
of 626 patients (1·1–3·4) had post 
operative complications 
that were associated with in-hospital mortality. Cardio-
vascular complications had the highest associated 
mortality (nine [43%] of 21; [21·7–64·0]). The median 
length of stay in hospital was 3 (IQR 3–4) days.
The multivariable analyses of the a-priori associations 
between preoperative risk factors and maternal mortality 
are shown in table 3, and perioperative complications and 
maternal mortality are shown in table 4. A pre 
operative 
major bleeding risk was the only preoperative risk factor 
associated with maternal mortality (OR 4·47 [95% CI 
1·47–13·65]). The perioperative complications indepen-
dently associated with maternal mortality were severe 
obstetric 
haemorrhage 
(5·87 
[1·99–17·35]) 
and 
anaesthesia complications (11·47 [1·20–109·20]). There 
was no collinearity with these associations. The sensitivity 
analyses for hospital compliant sites, country compliant 
sites, and hospital and country clusters were consistent 
with the main analyses (appendix pp 25–28). The inde-
pendent associations with maternal mortality in the 
preoperative and intraoperative models remained un-
changed when controlling for gestational age and the 
level of the anaesthesia or obstetric provider.
Neonatal outcomes data were missing for 410 (10·8%) of 
3792 mothers. The neonatal mortality was 153 (4·4%) of 
3506 infants (95% CI 3·7–5·0). Cardiopulmonary resusci-
tation was required in 313 (9·3%) of 3371 of neonates, of 
whom 55 (17·6%) died. The associations with neonatal 
outcomes are shown in table 5. The neonatal mortality was 
140 (4·1%) of 3382 infants (3·5–4·8) for the first born, and 
13 (11%) of 121 infants (5·2–16·3) for the second born 
neonate. Of the deliveries, 347 (9·9%) of 3497 were at 
35 weeks or less gestation and 3150 (90·1%) were at more 
than 35 weeks gestation. The neonatal mortality was 
75 (2·5%) of 3002 for more than 35 weeks gestation and 
62 (18·0%) of 344 for 35 weeks or less gestation. 140 (3·9%)

of 3630 neonates had an Apgar score of less than 5 at 
5 min. Apgar scores of less than 7 at 1 min and less than 5 
at 5 min were indepen 
dently associated with neonatal 
mortality, regardless of the gestational age (table 5). The 
need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation was only 
independently associated with mortality in neonates of 
≤35 weeks gestational age. These results are consistent 
with the sensitivity analysis of the protocol-compliant 
countries and hospital clusters (appendix p 29).
Maternal mortality was similar between primary 
(three [1%] of 422), secondary (five [0·4%] of 1217), and 
tertiary (12 [0·6%] of 1885) level hospitals (p=0·656). 
Neonatal mortality also did not differ across primary 
(17 [4%] of 401), secondary (46 [4·0%] of 1160), and tertiary 
(74 [4·2%] of 1700) level hospitals (p=0·878).
The addition of the hospital level to the logistic 
regression did not alter the overall associations with 
maternal and neonatal mortality.

delivery in Africa was 5·43 per 1000 operations (95% CI 
3·1–7·8), and neonatal mortality was 44 per 1000 births 
(37–51). Scarce specialist cover is available to provide peri-
operative care during caesarean delivery with a median of 
0·7 specialists per 100 000 population (IQR 0·2–2·0). 
African mothers are at least 50 times more likely to 
die after caesarean delivery compared with mothers 
in high-income countries (appendix p 30).20,21 Previous 
estimates based on modelling strategies have substantially 
underestimated the risk of mortality after caesarean 
delivery in sub-Saharan Africa.10 The neonatal mortality 
rate is approximately double the global average, nearly 
one in 20 babies will die in the early neonatal period.3 
Gestational age and Apgar scores are independently 
associated with early neonatal mortality.
Low access to caesarean delivery in Africa6 results in 
mothers presenting for surgery with a high perioperative 
risk (figure 2). High ASA status was independently 
associated with mortality, highlighting its importance 
in predicting outcomes. Perioperative complications are 
com 
mon, with approximately one in six women dev-
eloping a perioperative complication after caesarean 
delivery—nearly 3 times that of women in the USA—
although more than three quarters of caesarean deliveries 
in our study were performed as emergencies.20
The perioperative complications independently associ-
ated with maternal mortality in Africa are obstetric 
haemorrhage and anaesthesia complications. One in 
17 patients presented with a major preoperative bleeding 
risk, which is an independent preoperative risk factor for 
in-hospital maternal mortality. It is possible that the 
morbidity associated with a major preoperative bleeding 
risk is increased in Africa due to low access to caesarean 
delivery. Haemorrhage accounts for nearly 70% of all 
complications, and 25% of all deaths occurred after 
severe obstetric haemorrhage.
A previous systematic review9 suggested that anaesthesia 
contributes up to 2·8% of all maternal deaths after 
obstetric procedures in low-income and middle-income 
countries and 13·8% of deaths after caesarean delivery. 
Our prospectively collected data suggest that in Africa, the 
contribution of anaesthesia to maternal mortality is similar 
at 10%. Despite the high preoperative maternal risk profile, 
and the high prevalence of complications, nearly a quarter 
of all anaesthetics for caesarean delivery in our study are 
administered by non-physician anaes 
thesia providers. It is 
unclear, due to the small numbers and large CIs, whether 
the level of the anaesthesia provider contributes directly to 
maternal mortality in Africa, although the point estimate 
favours increased maternal mortality with non-physician 
anaesthetists. This finding is consistent with existing 
literature.9 Identification of high-risk patients is possible in 
the preoperative period, especially mothers at risk of 
obstetric haemorrhage, and this identification should 
initiate processes for the provision of care by more senior 
surgical and anaesthesia staff.9
The neonatal mortality rate for our study was higher 
than expected but in an exclusively postsurgical popu-
lation. The global average neonatal mortality rate for all 
deliveries in 2016, was 19 per 1000 deliveries, with sub-
Saharan Africa at 28 per 1000 deliveries.3 The higher rate in 
our study might be due to under-reporting in global studies 
or because we are studying a higher risk population 
(operative deliveries alone, as opposed to all deliveries). 
One in 11 neonates in Africa required cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation, and one in 23 neonates died after caesarean 
delivery. For those neonates that survive the early neonatal 
period, the prognosis is still markedly poorer than 
neonates born to mothers in high-income countries. 
Although we did not collect more detailed neonatal data 
associated with neonatal encephalopathy, such as neonatal 
acid base status, we observed that 3·9% of the neonates 
had an Apgar score of less than 5 at 5 min, which is a crude 
measure of the likelihood of developing neonatal 
encephalopathy.18 
Furthermore, 
low 
Apgar 
scores, 
particularly at 5 min, have been associated with an 
increased incidence of cerebral palsy and epilepsy.22–25 In a 
Swedish study,25 the incidence of Apgar scores from 0 to 6 
was 1·8% and was 0·4% for scores less than 4 after 
caesarean delivery, suggesting that an Apgar score of less 
than 5 is between 2·2 and 10·7 times more frequent in 
Africa. Therefore, improvements in early neonatal care 
after caesarean delivery in Africa could decrease the long-
term health-care burden of cerebral palsy and epilepsy.
Our data has shown a high incidence of adverse 
outcomes across 22 countries in Africa, confirming 
previous work. While country-specific maternal mortality 
ratios are often derived, some data from resource-poor 
settings are available. One prospective study26 collected 
data from 314 623 women across four continents who 
delivered either vaginally or by caesarean delivery with 
the use of the maternal severity index and near-miss 
approach. Conversely, our paper specifically targets an 
African surgical population and showed a significantly 
higher rate of bleeding (3·8 vs 2·7%), hypertensive 
disease (12·2% vs 2·5%), and far worse neonatal 
outcomes (44 vs 26 per 1000 livebirths). These results 
might have been expected in an exclusively post-
caesarean population but illustrate that with higher event

rates, interventions that target the surgical population 
might have a substantial affect.
African countries need to improve both access to 
caesarean delivery and the safety of this procedure. 
Paradoxically, while many countries are aiming to reduce 
the caesarean delivery rate, increasing the rate of caesarean 
delivery remains a priority in Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa, 
the caesarean delivery rate is static at 3·5%, despite an 
increasing pattern in rates globally.27 Improving access to 
surgery might allow patients to present earlier and thus 
mitigate against adverse out 
comes. This improvement 
must occur in parallel with programmes aimed at 
improving patient safety during caesarean delivery. 
Context-sensitive interventions aimed at addressing the 
adverse outcomes highlighted in our study need to follow. 
Areas that should be targeted include early risk 
identification (eg, ASA status, risk of bleeding) linked to a 
contextualised bundle of care, including checklists and a 
higher level of monitoring (eg, involving relatives, proximity 
of the bed to the nursing station); consideration of a lower 
threshold for the use of antifibrinolytic drugs (tranexamic 
acid) as prophylaxis against post-partum haemorrhage, 
especially where availability of blood is low; improvement 
of access to blood and blood products with long shelf lives, 
such as freeze-dried plasma and fibrinogen; and novel 
methods of training of non-physician anaesthetists, 
including online support and mobile-based applications.
Our study also had some limitations. The WHO has 
developed a near-miss tool for the monitoring of quality of 
health care, which has subsequently been developed into 
the WHO near-miss approach.28 This system was designed 
for use in individual institutions and collects data in three 
distinct areas (clinical, laboratory-based, and management-
based criteria). Although this tool is a useful method of 
assessing institutions, we did not include the large 
number of data fields suggested for the near-miss tool, for 
reasons of study pragmatism. Additionally, the WHO tool 
often requires local modification, which might have 
precluded its use in a multinational study.29 Although 
near-miss data has been reported for several African 
countries, the process is often driven by international 
research teams involved in quality improvement initiatives 
or represents a single audit process at selected institutions 
and therefore might not result in broadly generalisable 
data.29–33 Our study aimed to address this shortfall by 
collecting morbidity data in obstetrics and neonatology in 
a multinational African study, thereby generating more 
generalisable data for Africa.
Second, although we recruited almost 4000 patients, the 
data are limited to some degree through dis 
proportionate 
recruitment. The data is predominantly from government 
hospitals (80%) in middle-income countries (66·3%). Only 
22% of the patients received their operations at district 
level hospitals. Furthermore, in 26% of cases a specialist 
obstetrician was involved and in 22% of cases a specialist 
anaesthesiologist was involved in the management, which 
is unlikely to reflect the broader African context. The 
outcomes presented here might therefore be better than 
that expected across Africa. Reverse causality might also 
exist, in which the sickest and more complex patients are 
referred to a higher level with worse outcomes. However, 
data from the confidential enquiry process in South Africa 
suggests that mortality is higher in district hospitals, a 
group that is under-represented in our sample.17
Third, we were unable to collect data in several potentially 
useful areas. We did not collect the number of normal 
deliveries occurring at the institutional level, meaning we 
were unable to calculate and comment on the caesarean 
delivery rate or link this to maternal and neonatal out-
comes. We were also unable to calculate the overall 
maternal mortality ratio for the study period and did not 
assess the indication and timeliness of operative inter-
vention. These data might have provided further insight 
into the service context at an institutional level. We did 
not collect related data, such as the adequacy of antenatal 
care or the availability of blood bank services, which might 
have provided insight into the contribution of available 
resources towards maternal outcomes. Our study included 
only adults: we are thus unable to com 
ment on the 
outcomes in teenage pregnancy (a high-risk group).
Fourth, we advise caution in generalising the findings 
of this study to Africa. Eleven of the included countries 
did not provide per-protocol data samples for this study, 
which might compromise the generalisability to these 
countries. Our sensitivity analysis, however, showed little 
difference between per-protocol compliant hospitals and 
the entire cohort. Furthermore, although 22 African 
countries partici 
pated, this number is still fewer than 
half of the countries in Africa, of which several non-
participating countries are low-income countries. We also 
pooled maternal deaths from all participating countries 
for the regression analysis; given the potentially different 
contexts within countries, which might further compro-
mise general 
isability. Controlling for hospital and country 
clusters however resulted in similar findings to the main 
analyses.
Finally, the data submitted were not validated, with the 
exception of the soft data limits at the time of data sub-
mission and the queries to investigators of data outliers 
during data cleaning.
The strength of our work is that we have done a large, 
prospective study across Africa. This study suggests that 
the incidence of both maternal and neonatal compli 
cations 
in Africa is substantially higher than previously appreci-
ated. Furthermore, these data have enabled us to identify 
risk factors independently associated with maternal mor-
tality, which include preoperative risk factors for obstetric 
haemorrhage and the perioperative complications of 
peripartum haemorrhage and anaesthesia complications. 
Attention should therefore be focused on these areas to 
improve maternal and neonatal outcomes in Africa.
