Superior MRI outcomes with
alemtuzumab compared with subcutaneous
interferon b-1a in MS
ABSTRACT
Objective: To describe detailed MRI results from 2 head-to-head phase III trials, Comparison of
Alemtuzumab and Rebif Efficacy in Multiple Sclerosis Study I (CARE-MS I; NCT00530348)
and Study II (CARE-MS II; NCT00548405), of alemtuzumab vs subcutaneous interferon b-1a
(SC IFN-b-1a) in patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).
Methods: The impact of alemtuzumab 12 mg vs SC IFN-b-1a 44 mg on MRI measures was
evaluated in patients with RRMS who were treatment-naive (CARE-MS I) or who had an inade-
quate response, defined as at least one relapse, to prior therapy (CARE-MS II).
Results: Both treatments prevented T2-hyperintense lesion volume increases from baseline.
Alemtuzumab was more effective than SC IFN-b-1a on most lesion-based endpoints in both
studies (p , 0.05), including decreased risk of new/enlarging T2 lesions over 2 years and
gadolinium-enhancing lesions at year 2. Reduced risk of new T1 lesions (p , 0.0001) and
gadolinium-enhancing lesion conversion to T1-hypointense black holes (p 5 0.0078) were
observed with alemtuzumab vs SC IFN-b-1a in CARE-MS II. Alemtuzumab slowed brain volume
loss over 2 years in CARE-MS I (p , 0.0001) and II (p 5 0.012) vs SC IFN-b-1a.
Conclusions: Alemtuzumab demonstrated greater efficacy than SC IFN-b-1a on MRI endpoints in
active RRMS. The superiority of alemtuzumab was more prominent during the second year of
both studies. These findings complement the superior clinical efficacy of alemtuzumab over SC
IFN-b-1a in RRMS.
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00530348 and NCT00548405.
Classification of evidence: The results reported here provide Class I evidence that, for patients
with active RRMS, alemtuzumab is superior to SC IFN-b-1a on multiple MRI endpoints.

MRI plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of multiple sclerosis (MS)1,2 and
provides mechanistic insights into the clinical efficacy of disease-modifying therapies. Meta-
analyses show a correlation between the effects of pharmacotherapies on MRI, relapse rate,3,4
and disability.5 Accordingly, MRI assessments are commonly included as efficacy endpoints in
MS clinical trials.6 MRI of MS patients visualizes inflammatory brain white matter lesions7 and

Alemtuzumab (LEMTRADA; Sanofi Gen-
zyme, Cambridge, MA), a humanized anti-
CD52 monoclonal antibody approved in many
countries for the treatment of active relapsing-
remitting MS (RRMS),9–11 was evaluated in 2
phase III trials in active RRMS (Comparison of
Alemtuzumab and Rebif Efficacy in Multiple
Sclerosis Study I [CARE-MS I], treatment-
naive patients; and Study II [CARE-MS II],
patients with an inadequate response, defined
as one or more relapse, to prior therapy). The
most common adverse events with alemtuzu-
mab were mild to moderate infusion-associated
reactions. Other adverse events included infec-
tions and autoimmune disorders.12,13
Despite subcutaneous interferon b-1a (SC
IFN-b-1a; Rebif; EMD Serono Inc, Rock-
land, MA) suppressing focal inflammatory
activity on MRI by z80%,14 superior benefit
was observed in both CARE-MS studies for
alemtuzumab compared with SC IFN-b-1a
regarding the percentage of patients free of
MRI disease activity and reduction in brain
volume loss. Here, we report additional MRI
outcomes for these 2 trials, including analyses
of lesion numbers, risk of new lesions, and
brain atrophy by year.
METHODS Standard protocol approvals, registrations,
and patient consents. The CARE-MS I (ClinicalTrials.gov
number NCT00530348) and CARE-MS II (ClinicalTrials.gov
number NCT00548405) trials were carried out in accordance
with the International Conference on Harmonization Good
Clinical Practice guidelines, applicable domestic and international
regulations, including US 21 Code of Federal Regulations part 312
(Investigational New Drug Application) and parts 50 and 56
(concerning informed consent and institutional review board
regulations), and clinical research guidelines established by the
principles defined in the World Medical Association’s Declaration
of Helsinki and its amendments. Accordingly, approval was received
from an ethical standards committee in human experimentation,
and all patients gave written informed consent before participating
in the studies.
Study design. Trial designs, published in detail elsewhere,12,13 are
summarized briefly here. The CARE-MS program consisted of 2
phase III, randomized, 2-year, rater-blinded, active-controlled, head-
to-head trials of alemtuzumab vs SC IFN-b-1a in patients with
RRMS who were treatment-naive (CARE-MS I) or had an
inadequate response (one or more relapse after $6 months of
treatment) to prior therapy (CARE-MS II).12,13 Patients were
randomized 2:1 to receive alemtuzumab 12 mg/d IV on 5
consecutive days at baseline and on 3 consecutive days 12 months
later or SC IFN-b-1a 44 mg 3 times weekly. Coprimary endpoints
were relapse rate and time to 6-month sustained accumulation of
disability. In CARE-MS II, IFN-b-1a–neutralizing antibodies were
assayed at baseline and 24 months with a cytopathic effect inhibition
assay (BioMonitor, Copenhagen, Denmark).
Study outcomes. This analysis aimed to determine whether
superior outcomes (clinical and top-line MRI) observed with
alemtuzumab vs SC IFN-b-1a in the CARE-MS studies were
also observed for secondary and tertiary MRI measures from
these studies. The results reported here provide Class I evidence
that, for patients with active RRMS, alemtuzumab is superior to
SC IFN-b-1a on multiple MRI endpoints. The results represent
Class I evidence because of several elements of the study design.
Randomization was stratified by clinical site. Furthermore,
masked raters were used for study assessments related to key
efficacy endpoints.
MRI protocol. MRI scans were obtained at baseline and annu-
ally. CARE-MS II patients had at least a 30-day washout from
prior IFN-b or glatiramer acetate before baseline MRI. Baseline
and posttreatment scans were analyzed at NeuroRx Research
(Montreal, QC, Canada; lesion analyses) and the Cleveland
Clinic MS MRI Analysis Center (Cleveland, OH; brain
parenchymal fraction [BPF]) by experts masked to treatment-
group assignment.
T1-weighted pre–
and
post–gadolinium contrast, T2-
weighted and proton density (dual-echo) precontrast, fluid-
attenuated inversion recovery precontrast, and 3-dimensional
gradient-echo, postcontrast MRI sequences were performed
before methylprednisolone administration. These data enabled
comprehensive analyses of T2, T1, and gadolinium-enhancing
lesions and brain atrophy.
Percentage change in T2 lesion volume was a secondary end-
point. Tertiary MRI endpoints included new/enlarging T2, new
T1 and gadolinium-enhancing lesion counts, percentage change
in T1 lesion volume, proportion of patients free from MRI disease
activity (absence of new gadolinium-enhancing and new/enlarging
T2 lesions), percentage of gadolinium-enhancing lesions evolving
to chronic T1 lesions (black holes), and brain atrophy.
T2-weighted lesions were segmented15 and manually corrected
as necessary. T1 lesions were segmented within T2-weighted lesions
with the use of a threshold of 85% of the intensity of surrounding
normal-appearing white matter. Regions of acute T1 hypointensity
associated with gadolinium enhancement were not counted in the
analysis. New lesion counts were made relative to the prior visit and
added over time intervals as appropriate. Brain volume loss was
measured with the BPF metric, calculated from proton density/
T2-weighted dual-echo images with brain segmentation software
developed at the Cleveland Clinic.16
Statistical analysis. Percentage changes from baseline to year 2,
years 1 to 2, and baseline to year 1 in T2 and T1 lesion volume
and BPF were analyzed with the ranked analysis of covariance
with adjustment for baseline value and geographic region.
Lesion counts were analyzed through negative binomial
regression with robust standard error estimation and adjustment
for
baseline
count
and
geographic
region.
Gadolinium-
enhancing, T1, and T2 lesion activity, defined as any new lesion
first appearing at the specified time point, was analyzed with
logistic regression.
Odds of MRI disease activity at any postbaseline visit were
analyzed through logistic regression with adjustment for baseline
gadolinium-enhancing lesion count and geographic region.

 Odds of gadolinium-enhancing lesions evolving to black
holes were analyzed with a marginal logistic model fit through
generalized estimating equations with a compound symmetric
working correlation matrix, robust variance estimation, and
adjustment for geographic region. Reported p values are nominal
and not adjusted for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS Patients. The studies included 1,248 pa-
tients with RRMS. In total, 386 treatment-naive
(CARE-MS
I)
patients
were
randomized
to
alemtuzumab (376 were treated) and 195 to SC
IFN-b-1a (187 treated). Among patients with
inadequate response to prior therapy (CARE-MS
II),
436
were
randomized
to
alemtuzumab
(426 treated) and 231 to SC IFN-b-1a (202
treated).12,13
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics
were consistent with active RRMS and similar
between treatment arms (table 1). CARE-MS II pa-
tients had longer disease duration (per protocol, up to
10 years vs 5 years in CARE-MS I) and higher base-
line Expanded Disability Status Scale scores (per pro-
tocol, up to 5.0 vs 3.0 in CARE-MS I). The average
duration of prior disease-modifying therapy for
CARE-MS II patients was 35 months.
Scans analyzed. In CARE-MS I, depending on the
MRI metric, analyzable scans were available for
98.4% to 98.8% of patients at baseline, 96.4% to
97.0% at year 1, and 93.3% to 96.6% at year 2.
Values for CARE-MS II were as follows: 98.2% to
99.2% at baseline, 95.7% to 97.0% at year 1, and
91.7% to 96.6% at year 2. In cases with missing
data, the main reason for not performing the scan
was withdrawal from the study (2.3% in CARE-MS
I and 4.0% in CARE-MS II).
Inflammatory lesion activity. The risk of developing
new/enlarging T2 lesions was significantly lower with
alemtuzumab vs SC IFN-b-1a over the 2-year study
period and in year 2 for CARE-MS I patients (risk
reduction 34%, odds ratio 0.66, 95% confidence
interval [CI] 0.45–0.97; and risk reduction 57%,
odds ratio 0.43, 95% CI 0.29–0.64, respectively,

and risk reduction 73%, odds ratio 0.27, 95% CI
0.19–0.39, both p , 0.0001, figure 2A and table
e-1). Risk of T2 lesions also decreased significantly in
year 1 in CARE-MS II patients (risk reduction 53%,
odds ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.33–0.68, p , 0.0001).
Alemtuzumab was also superior to SC IFN-b-1a
with respect to the cumulative number of new/enlarg-
ing T2 lesions. In CARE-MS I patients, the mean
number of T2 lesions significantly decreased with
alemtuzumab vs SC IFN-b-1a over the 2-year study
period (mean count 2.3 [SD 6.1] vs 3.2 [SD 5.3]) and
in year 2 (0.7 [SD 2.6] vs 1.6 [SD 3.8], both p ,
0.05). Among CARE-MS II patients, significant re-
ductions were also observed with alemtuzumab over
the 2-year period (3.6 [SD 11.8] vs 8.4 [SD 17.5],
p , 0.0001), in year 1 (2.2 [SD 7.6] vs 4.3 [SD 9.8],
p , 0.05), and in year 2 (1.4 [SD 5.8] vs 4.1 [SD
9.1], p , 0.0001).
Both treatments were effective in reducing the forma-
tion of gadolinium-enhancing lesions (figures 1B and
2B) compared with baseline (table 1). At year 2, the risk
of
gadolinium-enhancing
lesions
was
significantly
reduced with alemtuzumab vs SC IFN-b-1a for both
CARE-MS I and CARE-MS II (risk reduction 70%,
odds ratio 0.30, 95% CI 0.17–0.53; and risk reduction
69%, odds ratio 0.31, 95% CI 0.19–0.51, both p ,
0.0001), as was the mean number of gadolinium-
enhancing lesions (mean count 0.2 [SD 0.8] vs 0.3
[SD 1.0] and 0.3 [SD 1.5] vs 1.1 [SD 4.1], respectively,
both p , 0.05). At year 1, significantly more
alemtuzumab-treated than SC IFN-b-1a–treated pa-
tients were free from gadolinium-enhancing lesions in
CARE-MS II (85.9% vs 76.8%, p 5 0.0036, figure 2B).
Further subgroup analyses of CARE-MS II pa-
tients showed that the reduced risk of T2 lesions
and gadolinium-enhancing lesions with alemtuzumab
vs SC IFN-b-1a was statistically significant regardless
of prior SC IFN-b-1a treatment or the presence/
absence of baseline IFN-b-1a–neutralizing antibodies
(figures e-1 and e-2).
T2-hyperintense lesion volume. Both treatments led to
initial reductions from baseline in median T2 lesion

 volumes (figure 3, A and B). The largest reductions
were seen in CARE-MS I during year 1, after initiation
of alemtuzumab or SC IFN-b-1a treatment (figure
3A).
This
effect
was
significantly
greater
for
alemtuzumab vs SC IFN-b-1a in year 2 (p 5
0.0364), reflecting a further reduction in mean
(20.9%) and median (21.8%, figure 3A) T2 lesion
volumes in alemtuzumab-treated patients compared
with SC IFN-b-1a–treated patients, in whom mean
T2 lesion volume increased (3.0%) and median T2
lesion volume was unchanged. In CARE-MS II, T2
lesion volume changed minimally over the 2-year study
in all patients; however, a significant between-
treatment difference in favor of alemtuzumab was
observed in year 2 (p 5 0.0261, figure 3B).
New T1-hypointense lesions. The risk of developing
new T1-hypointense lesions was significantly lower
with alemtuzumab compared with SC IFN-b-1a in
year 1 (51% reduction, odds ratio 0.49, 95% CI
0.32–0.74), in year 2 (79% reduction, odds ratio
0.21, 95% CI 0.13–0.36), and over the 2-year
study period (63% reduction, odds ratio 0.37, 95%
CI 0.25–0.55, all p , 0.001, figure 2C) for CARE-
MS II patients and in year 2 for CARE-MS I patients
(67% reduction, odds ratio 0.33, 95% CI 0.19–0.58,
p 5 0.0001, figure 1C). A significantly greater
reduction in T1 lesion volume was observed with
alemtuzumab vs SC IFN-b-1a in year 1 and over
the 2-year study period in CARE-MS I (both p ,
0.05, figure 3C). In year 2, an increase in T1 lesion
volume was observed in year 2 with SC IFN-b-1a but
not with alemtuzumab (p , 0.05). In CARE-MS II,
T1 lesion volume increased in year 1 with SC IFN-
b-1a but not with alemtuzumab (p , 0.05, figure
3D).
Conversion to black holes. Gadolinium-enhancing
lesions that formed in year 1 were significantly less
likely to evolve into chronic black holes by year 2
in alemtuzumab-treated patients in CARE-MS II
compared with those receiving SC IFN-b-1a (67%
risk reduction, p 5 0.0078). No significant reduction
in black hole conversion in year 2 was observed in
alemtuzumab-treated patients compared with SC
IFN-b-1a–treated patients in CARE-MS I (45%,

 p 5 0.1389). No difference was seen for lesions
measured at year 1 that formed before treatment
and were enhancing at baseline.
Brain parenchymal fraction. Alemtuzumab significantly
reduced brain volume loss compared with SC
IFN-b-1a in CARE-MS I patients (figure 4A)
during year 1 (20.59% vs 20.94%, p , 0.0001)
and year 2 (20.25% vs 20.50%, p 5 0.0052) and
over the 2-year study period (20.87% vs 21.49%,
p , 0.0001). CARE-MS II patients similarly had less
brain volume loss during year 1 (20.47% vs
20.54%) and year 2 (20.22% vs 20.35%) after
alemtuzumab (figure 4B), although the reduction
was statistically significant only over the 2-year
study period (20.62% vs 20.81%, p 5 0.012).
Freedom from MRI disease activity. Alemtuzumab sig-
nificantly increased the percentage of treatment-
naive patients free from MRI disease activity vs SC
IFN-b-1a during year 2 (p , 0.0001) and over the
entire course of CARE-MS I (p 5 0.0388, figure
1D). In CARE-MS II, alemtuzumab significantly
increased the percentage of MRI disease activity–
free patients vs SC IFN-b-1a during year 1 (p 5
0.0001), during year 2 (p , 0.0001), and over the
2-year study period (p , 0.0001, figure 2D).
DISCUSSION The CARE-MS I and II studies in pa-
tients with active RRMS who were treatment-naive or
who had an inadequate response to prior therapy,
respectively, met the clinical efficacy objective of
demonstrating a statistically significant treatment effect
of alemtuzumab compared with the active comparator
SC IFN-b-1a for at least one coprimary efficacy
endpoint
(annualized
relapse
rate
or
6-month
sustained accumulation of disability), as previously
reported.12,13 We report here that the treatment effects
of alemtuzumab also surpassed the well-established
benefits of SC IFN-b-1a on many MRI endpoints,
providing complementary evidence for the observed
clinical efficacy of alemtuzumab in patients with RRMS.
Marked benefits of alemtuzumab beyond those of
SC IFN-b-1a during the first year of study were
observed in one or both of the CARE-MS studies for

 many MRI outcomes. After 2 years, the benefits of
alemtuzumab vs SC IFN-b-1a were even more appar-
ent, with significantly better outcomes emerging both
in treatment-naive patients and in those with an inad-
equate response to prior therapy for all MRI markers of
focal inflammatory disease, including T2-hyperintense
lesion volume, cumulative number and overall risk
of developing new/enlarging T2- and gadolinium-
enhancing lesions, risk of developing new T1 lesions,
and percentage of patients free from MRI disease activ-
ity. Because alemtuzumab-treated patients received
a second course at the beginning of the second year
of the study (corresponding to a full course of therapy
for the treatment of active RRMS), the second alemtu-
zumab course appears to have contributed to the overall
degree of efficacy seen at 2 years and beyond in these
and previous studies17,18 and may further increase the
effect on core disease mechanisms and hence longer-
term clinical outcome.
T2-hyperintense lesion volume is an MRI marker
of MS disease burden. In the absence of effective MS
therapy, the volume of T2 lesions typically increases
over time. For example, in the pivotal trial of SC
IFN-b-1a, the placebo group had a 10% increase in
T2 lesion volume over 2 years, and the efficacy of SC
IFN-b-1a was demonstrated by an z4% reduction
in lesion volume.14 T2 lesion volume changes may be
less easily interpreted in an active comparator trial. In
a 1-year study of fingolimod (1.25 or 0.5 mg daily) vs
intramuscular IFN-b-1a, changes in T2 lesion vol-
ume did not differ significantly between treatment
groups19 even though both therapies have shown effi-
cacy on this measure in placebo-controlled trials.20,21
Similarly, in the CARE-MS studies, there was no
difference between treatments in T2 lesion volume
change over 2 years (a secondary endpoint), but the
initial reductions in T2 lesion volume with either
treatment compared to baseline represent a positive
outcome that likely reflects the effectiveness of both
alemtuzumab and SC IFN-b-1a. Finally, although
the year 1 T2 volume results were dominated by
resolution of preexisting T2 lesions, a significant dif-
ference between treatments emerged in year 2 in both
studies, again suggesting potential benefit of the sec-
ond alemtuzumab treatment course and resulting in
durable effectiveness of alemtuzumab compared with
SC IFN-b-1a in preventing new lesion formation.
The superiority of alemtuzumab vs SC IFN-b-1a
in suppressing new MS lesion formation was also
apparent in the reduced risk of developing T2- and
gadolinium-enhancing brain lesions in both CARE-
MS studies. Furthermore, subgroup analyses of
CARE-MS II patients showed that the reduction
in risk of T2- and gadolinium-enhancing lesions
with alemtuzumab vs SC IFN-b-1a was observed
regardless of prior SC IFN-b-1a use or baseline
IFN-b-1a–neutralizing antibody status.
In both CARE-MS studies, alemtuzumab had a ben-
eficial impact on MRI outcomes that have been linked
to disability progression. Brain volume loss begins early
in MS; such loss is considered to reflect tissue destruc-
tion and has been shown to correlate with disability pro-
gression.5,10,16,22,23 Alemtuzumab significantly reduced
brain volume loss compared with SC IFN-b-1a, and
over the 2 years of study, there was a continued decel-
eration of volume loss in both patient populations.
Moreover, it is possible that the observed results under-
estimate the treatment effect of alemtuzumab on this
measure. Some of the apparent brain volume loss may
actually reflect a therapeutic decrease in inflammation
and edema, an effect called pseudo-atrophy.16 The
greater apparent brain volume loss in CARE-MS I than
in CARE-MS II supports this interpretation because
treatment-naive patients would be expected to have
more preexisting inflammation and edema than patients

 who had received prior disease-modifying therapies.
Alemtuzumab also had a beneficial impact on other
MRI outcomes that have been linked to neurologic
impairment and accumulation of disability.24,25 Active
inflammatory
lesions
that
previously
showed
gadolinium enhancement may evolve into chronic
T1-hypointense lesions, called black holes, representing
foci of permanently reduced axonal density.25 In CARE-
MS II, alemtuzumab-treated patients were more likely
than SC IFN-b-1a–treated patients to have no new T1
lesions, and alemtuzumab significantly reduced the per-
centage of gadolinium-enhancing lesions converting to
black holes vs SC IFN-b-1a during year 2. Therefore,
imaging outcomes from both studies suggest that alem-
tuzumab has a more beneficial effect than SC IFN-b-1a
on the chronic neurodegenerative processes associated
with MS and support the observation in patients who
had an inadequate response to prior therapy that alem-
tuzumab can slow the accumulation of disability more
effectively than SC IFN-b-1a.26
We report here that, in both CARE-MS studies, the
treatment effects of alemtuzumab surpassed the well-
established benefits of the active comparator SC IFN-
b-1a on a range of MRI endpoints linked to both the
focal inflammatory disease associated with MS and
chronic neurodegenerative processes associated with
the accumulation of disability. The MRI findings re-
ported here therefore provide complementary evidence
for the observed clinical efficacy of alemtuzumab vs SC
IFN-b-1a in patients with RRMS.
