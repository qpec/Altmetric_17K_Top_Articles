Abstract
Objectives: Prescribing of homeopathy still occurs in a
small minority of English general practices. We hypoth-
esised that practices that prescribe any homeopathic prep-
arations might differ in their prescribing of other drugs.
Design: Cross-sectional analysis.
Setting: English primary care.
Participants: English general practices.
Main outcome measures: We identified practices that
made any homeopathy prescriptions over six months of
data. We measured associations with four prescribing and
two practice quality indicators using multivariable logistic
regression.
Results: Only 8.5% of practices (644) prescribed homeop-
athy between December 2016 and May 2017. Practices in
the worst-scoring quartile for a composite measure of pre-
scribing quality (>51.4 mean percentile) were 2.1 times
more likely to prescribe homeopathy than those in the
best category (<40.3) (95% confidence interval: 1.6–2.8).
Aggregate savings from the subset of these measures where
a cost saving could be calculated were also strongly asso-
ciated (highest vs. lowest quartile multivariable odds ratio:
2.9, confidence interval: 2.1–4.1). Of practices spending the
most on medicines identified as ‘low value’ by NHS
England, 12.8% prescribed homeopathy, compared to
3.9% for lowest spenders (multivariable odds ratio: 2.6,
confidence interval: 1.9–3.6). Of practices in the worst cat-
egory for aggregated price-per-unit cost savings, 12.7% pre-
scribed homeopathy, compared to 3.5% in the best
category (multivariable odds ratio: 2.7, confidence interval:
1.9–3.9). Practice quality outcomes framework scores and
patient recommendation rates were not associated with
prescribing homeopathy (odds ratio range: 0.9–1.2).
Conclusions: Even infrequent homeopathy prescribing is
strongly associated with poor performance on a range of
prescribing quality measures, but not with overall patient
recommendation or quality outcomes framework score.
The association is unlikely to be a direct causal relationship,
but may reflect underlying practice features, such as the
extent of respect for evidence-based practice, or poorer
stewardship of the prescribing budget.

Introduction
Homeopathy is a controversial treatment, and NHS
England has recently consulted on future prescribing
within the NHS,1 with guidance having been issued,
which suggests homeopathic prescribing should not
be issued for new patients and should be deprescribed
in existing patients.2 Cochrane systematic reviews
have assessed the evidence for homeopathy in numer-
ous conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome,3
attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder4 and demen-
tia,5 all of which found insufficient evidence to sup-
port
use
of
homeopathy.
A
2015
Australian
government report concluded that ‘there are no
health conditions for which there is reliable evidence
that homeopathy is effective’.6
Homeopathy also has low biological plausibility.
Homeopathic treatments are made by identifying a
substance believed to elicit the symptom being treated
(such as nausea) and then diluting this by one drop of
the initial substance in 100 drops of water, typically
for 30 sequential dilutions, resulting in a solution of 1
in 1060. Although no molecules of the active ingredi-
ent remain, homeopaths assert that water has a
memory for substances previously diluted in it.7
A drop of this water is then shaken in a container
with lactose pills. Homeopaths assert that the pills
receive and transmit the qualities memorised previ-
ously by the water. Between each dilution, homeo-
paths state that the flask must be struck firmly
against a surface of leather overlaid on horsehair, in
order to ‘potentise’ the water.8 Tablets prepared in

 this fashion can then be prescribed to patients by doc-
tors using a standard NHS FP10 prescription form.
Despite the lack of evidence for homeopathy, and
its lack of a plausible mechanism, some NHS doctors
still prescribe it. However, there is limited evidence on
clinician factors associated with choosing to use hom-
eopathy, mostly based on surveys. German medical
students taking elective modules in homeopathy
scored lower in ‘science orientation’, but higher in
‘care
orientation’
and
were
less
motivated
by
‘status’ compared to their peers.9 A commonly cited
advantage of homeopathy is safety, and in a small
survey of healthcare staff from general practice in
London, 70% thought homeopathy could reduce
costs for some conditions; however, 55% thought it
could increase costs for others.10 Globally, personal
use of homeopathy in doctors has a strong associ-
ation with prescribing of homeopathy.11 There is
also some evidence on patient factors associated
with choosing homeopathy, again based on surveys:
patients are most likely to be female, better educated,
have healthier lifestyles and report lower tendency to
seek medical help when their child is ill.12,13
Using publicly available data, practices may be
measured on their prescribing quality through assess-
ment of the cost-effectiveness, efficacy and safety of
medicines prescribed, based on national guidelines.
Practices may also be judged by their quality out-
comes framework score and patient recommendation
rates. We hypothesised that practices that prescribe
any homeopathy might differ in their prescribing in
other measurable ways. We therefore set out to
explore whether general practices prescribing homeo-
pathic remedies also behave differently on these other
measures of general practitioner behaviour.
Methods
Study design
Retrospective
cross-sectional
study
incorporating
English general practices who have prescribed any
homeopathic remedies in the last six months versus
those not prescribing any in the same period. We use
both univariable and multivariable logistic regression
to investigate correlation of this binary ‘homeopathy’
outcome with several measures of practice prescribing
quality and behaviour.
Setting and data
We used data from our OpenPrescribing.net project,
which imports prescribing data from the monthly pre-
scribing data files published by NHS Digital.14 These
contain data on cost and volume prescribed for each
drug, dose and preparation, for each month, for each
English general practice. We extracted the most recent
six months of data available (December 2016 to May
2017 inclusive). This allowed us to determine practices
where homeopathy is prescribed and generate com-
posite prescribing measures for practices using the
various standard measures of prescribing quality
already in use on the OpenPrescribing project (sum-
marised below). We also merged the prescribing data
with publicly available data on practices from Public
Health England.15 This allowed us to adjust for sus-
pected confounders at the practice level. All standard
English practices labelled within the data as a ‘general
practice’ were included within the analysis; this
excluded prescribing in non-standard settings such
as prisons. Additionally, in order to further exclude
practices that are no longer active, those without a
2015/2016 quality outcomes framework score were
excluded. Using inclusive criteria such as this reduced
the likelihood of obtaining a biased sample.
Dependent and independent variables
Homeopathy prescribing was the dependent variable
in this study as it is possible to form a logical binary
variable (of ‘ever’ vs. ‘never’ prescribing), while this is
difficult for the other variables (prescribing and other
practice quality measures); however, we set out only
to identify potential associations, rather than to sug-
gest causality in either direction between homeopathy
use and poor prescribing. Homeopathy prescribing
practices were defined as those with at least one pre-
scription for homeopathy within the most recent six
months (December 2016 to May 2017 inclusive).
Prescribing and other practice quality measures
were divided a priori into quartiles for analysis, as
this provides more easily interpretable results.
We developed four prescribing quality measure-
ments as independent variables, using a variety of
existing metrics developed by OpenPrescribing:
1. Composite measure score: The 36 current standard
prescribing measures on OpenPrescribing16 which
have been developed to address issues of cost,
safety or efficacy by doctors and pharmacists
working
in
collaboration
with
data
analysts.
Each month, OpenPrescribing calculates the per-
centile that each practice is in, for each measure.
Measures are oriented such that a higher percentile
corresponds to what would be considered ‘worse’
prescribing (with the exception of those where no
value judgement is made, i.e. direct-acting oral
anticoagulants17
and
pregabalin,18
which
are
excluded from this analysis). For the purpose of
this study, we calculated the mean percentile that
168
Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 111(5)
 each practice was in across all measures, over the
previous six months. None of the measures include
any homeopathy prescription items.
2. Aggregate potential savings from measures: Using
all standard OpenPrescribing measures where a
cost saving can be calculated, we calculated the
total aggregated cost saving available per practice
over the previous six months. These savings were
calculated by comparing each practice’s prescrib-
ing with the cost of prescribing at the 10th percent-
ile of performance for each measure.
3. Composite low-value prescribing score: We assessed
prescribing behaviour on a series of 18 ‘low-value’
medications identified in a consultation created by
NHS England1 to reduce unwarranted variation,
provide clear guidance and reduce unnecessary
spending. The action plan included homeopathy
prescribing, but this measure was excluded for
the purposes of this analysis. For each practice,
we took the total spending on all identified medi-
cations, over the previous six months.
4. Aggregate price-per-unit potential savings: In addi-
tion to the potential savings from specific prescrib-
ing behaviour changes above, we also assessed
additional potential efficiency savings using the
‘price-per-unit’19 tool on OpenPrescribing that
helps identify whether a practice has cost-saving
opportunities for any chemical. This tool compares
the price paid, for each dose of any given chemical at
any given strength, against the price paid for the
same treatment by the practice at the 10th centile,
in order to calculate possible efficiency gains. For
this study, we aggregated all available savings from
price-per-unit over a one-year period (October 2015
to September 2016). There are no savings attribut-
able to switching between homeopathy prepar-
ations within the calculated price-per-unit savings.
Additional practice quality scores were obtained
from other public sources to be used as independent
variables:
1. Quality outcomes framework: a performance man-
agement metric used for general practitioners
within the NHS, produced by NHS Digital and
available from Public Health England.15
2. Patient recommendation of practices: describe the
percentage of patients that would recommend each
practice
and
available
from
Public
Health
England.15
Potential confounding variables
We used a number of demographic metrics (from
Public Health England15) to adjust for potential
systematic differences between practices and practice
populations that may have an influence on prescrib-
ing behaviour, including homeopathy use. These
were: index of multiple deprivation score, patients
with a long-term health condition (%), patients
aged over 65 years (%) and whether each practice is
a ‘dispensing practice’ (yes or no). We also adjusted
for prescribing volume (total items prescribed per
practice within the previous six months).
Analysis
We generated basic descriptive statistics to describe
the cohort, including medians and proportions as
appropriate, stratified by the binary homeopathy pre-
scribing variable. We also used a histogram to
describe the distribution of homeopathy prescribing
volume for those with at least one prescription. We
then performed a series of separate logistic regression
analyses with the binary homeopathy variable as the
outcome, and each of the four prescribing quality
measurements and two practice quality measure-
ments (divided a priori into quartiles) as the predict-
ive variables in separate regression models. We first
performed univariable logistic regression, then a
priori included all of the variables contained in the
potential confounders section above in order to
adjust for possible confounding in a multivariable
regression model. From these logistic regression
models, odds ratios were calculated, with correspond-
ing 95% confidence intervals. Practices with missing
data for a particular variable were not included in
models containing that variable. The level of missing
data was determined and reported for each variable.
We also report a sensitivity analysis with a nar-
rower definition of homeopathy prescribing, using-
� 6 prescriptions (rather than � 1) over the same
six-month period (corresponding to one per month
on average).

 outcomes framework score. A total of 7618 standard
current practices were therefore included within the
study, and 644 practices (8.5%) met the criteria of
having at least one homeopathy prescription within
the last six months. Of these, 363 practices had only
one homeopathy prescription during this time. There
were 2720 homeopathy prescriptions in total over the
six-month period, with a total expenditure of £36,532
(mean £13.43 per item). Only 38 practices had > 10
homeopathy prescriptions; only three practices had
> 100 prescriptions. The maximum number of hom-
eopathy prescriptions was 252 (see Figure 1). The
level of missing data was low, with 98.1% having
complete data for all variables (see Appendix 1).
The 6974 practices with no homeopathy prescrib-
ing showed lower (better) scores on all standard pre-
scribing measures than practices with homeopathy
prescribing (Table 1); however, significance tests
were reserved for the later modelling analysis. The
median of total items prescribed was higher in
practices prescribing homeopathy, while all other
practice features were similar
between the two
groups (Table 1).
Association of homeopathy with prescribing quality
measures
Each of the four prescribing quality measurements
was strongly associated with prescribing any hom-
eopathy. Furthermore, all of the four prescribing
quality measurements exhibited a strong, significant
trend where practices in each category of worsening
prescribing were more likely to prescribe any hom-
eopathy (Table 2). Adjustment for various prespeci-
fied practice factors such as demographics and index
of multiple deprivation score slightly reduced the size
but not significance of associations, with adjustment
for prescribing volume accounting for almost all of
the change in odds ratio.
In the composite measures score, those in the
worst score category (>51.4) were 2.1 times more
likely to prescribe any homeopathy than those in
the best category (<40.3) (multivariable odds ratio:
2.1, 95% confidence interval: 1.6–2.8). The aggregate
savings from the measures where a cost saving could
be calculated also showed a strong, significant trend:
those in categories with more available savings were
more likely to have prescribed any homeopathy than
those in categories with fewer available savings.
Prescribing of other ‘low value’ items, as identified
by NHS England, was also strongly associated with
prescribing any homeopathy: only 3.9% of practices
in the best category prescribed any homeopathy,
compared to 12.8% in the worst category (multivari-
able odds ratio: 2.6, confidence interval: 1.9–3.6).
Aggregate price-per-unit savings were also strongly
associated: in the category where the fewest savings
are available where prescribing value has therefore

 months, while for those where the most savings were
available, 12.7% of practices prescribed homeopathy
(multivariable odds ratio: 2.7, confidence interval:
1.9–3.9).
Association of homeopathy with practice quality
measures
Neither of the non-prescribing metrics that assess
practice quality (quality outcomes framework score
and the percentage of patients recommending prac-
tices) were associated with prescribing homeopathy
(Table 2). Odds ratios were universally close to 1
(range 0.8–1.2), with no significant associations
detected in either the univariable or multivariable
logistic regression.
Sensitivity analysis
If only practices that prescribed six prescriptions over
the six-month period (i.e. an average of 1 per month)
are included as homeopathy prescribers, the results
are broadly similar in terms of direction of effect
(Supplementary Table 1). Some associations remain
significant, although the overall level of significance is
lower due only 80 practices (1.1%) being in the hom-
eopathy prescribing group.
Discussion
Summary
We found that prescribing any homeopathy is asso-
ciated with poorer performance at practice level on a
range of standard prescribing measures. We also
found a dose–response relationship, with increasing
odds of prescribing any homeopathy associated with
worsening categories of performance on each prescrib-
ing measure: the worse a practice’s performance was
on our standard prescribing measures, the more likely
they were to have ever prescribed homeopathy. This
finding was robust to inclusion of data into the model
on a range of plausible confounders. Lower quality
outcomes framework scores were not associated with
increased odds of prescribing homeopathy nor were
patient recommendation scores. We used a highly
inclusive criteria for homeopathy prescribing (�1 pre-
scription over six months), and most practices that did
prescribe homeopathy did so in small volumes. Given
the low level of homeopathy prescribing, it is therefore
remarkable that any difference was found.
Strengths and weaknesses
We included all practices in England with a 2015/2016
quality outcomes framework score, thus minimising

 the potential for obtaining a biased sample. We
excluded 566 practices without a quality outcomes
framework score, as many of these practices are no
longer active and we reasoned that any practice not
participating in quality outcomes framework would be
less representative of a ‘typical’ general practice. This
may have excluded a small number of practices that
opened since the 2015/2016 quality outcomes frame-
work scores were calculated. We also used prospect-
ively gathered prescribing data rather than survey

 data, eliminating the possibility of recall bias. We were
able to measure and adjust for a range of a priori con-
founding variables related to practice characteristics.
Although we do not suggest that the associations
found were causal in either direction, this multivari-
able modelling allowed us to rule out these factors as
explaining the observed differences in prescribing. We
found that most of the factors we adjusted for made
little difference, and only prescribing volume made a
notable change to odds ratios.
Due to a large sample size and large effect sizes, we
obtained a high level of statistical significance in the
associations between homeopathy and measures of
prescribing quality. We also observed a dose–response
relationship, whereby practices obtaining better pre-
scribing measure scores were much less likely to have
prescribed homeopathy, further strengthening the
credibility of the associations found. Due to the low
volume of homeopathy prescribing, we had limited
ability to compare high- and low-volume prescribers
of homeopathy. Only 19 practices in England pre-
scribed more than 20 items of homeopathy over six
months. Consequently, there is limited statistical
power to compare low- and high-volume prescribers,
although our sensitivity analysis looking at higher
rates of prescribing (Supplementary Table 1) shows
broadly similar results to the main analysis.
We were only able to assess associations at practice
level, although it would have been interesting to deter-
mine if any associations are restricted to clinicians
prescribing homeopathy themselves, or whether such
associations extend to other clinicians working within
the same practice. Although we included data on a
range of potential confounders, including large expen-
sively collected datasets that are used consequently in
the NHS (such as the quality outcomes framework), it
is likely that there were additional unmeasured con-
founders at play in the relationship between homeop-
athy and prescribing quality. Indeed, we believe this to
be the core finding of the paper: it is unlikely that
prescribing homeopathy causes poorer performance,
or that poorer performance causes homeopathy use.
We propose that both aspects of prescribing are
driven by more fundamental issues, such as individual
clinicians’ skills on evidence-based medicine; or the
extent to which clinicians work together as a team
to review prescribing behaviour in their practice’s
data, identify areas where they are outliers or exhibit
unusual prescribing and take action collectively to
address issues identified.
Findings in context
This study is the first to explore the relationship
between homeopathy prescribing and other aspects
of clinical performance in general practices including
prescribing behaviour, overall patient recommenda-
tion and measures of clinical quality. Previous work
on clinician factors associated with alternative medi-
cine use is generally based on survey data. One
Scottish study combined quantitative prescribing
data with general practice survey data and found no
association of tendency to prescribe homeopathy
with length of time practising and reported that doc-
tors without training in homeopathy were less likely
to prescribe it.20 Survey data indicate that homeop-
athy is most often prescribed in NHS settings for
minor self-limiting conditions, and often followed
the failure of conventional treatment.10,20
Policy implications and interpretation
This analysis is not informative on the question of
whether homeopathy should be paid for by the
NHS. Indeed, we also find that total NHS expenditure
on homeopathy through the NHS prescribing budget
is low, at £36,532 over a six-month period. However,
our results do demonstrate that prescribing homeop-
athy is associated with different prescribing styles,
specifically with poorer performance on a range of
prescribing measures. In our view, this is more
important than cost. We believe this strong associ-
ation between homeopathy use and poorer prescrib-
ing in general should raise concerns and may be of
interest to those seeking to understand variation in
clinical styles and the use of alternative medicine by
clinicians. In addition, homeopathy prescribing may
provide some limited information about the overall
prescribing of a particular practice. However, it is
not a reliable predictor of prescribing quality, so we
strongly recommend close regular monitoring across a
diverse range of prescribing measures as the best way
to use data to monitor and improve prescribing.
Summary
Prescribing homeopathy is rare within NHS primary
care, but even a low level of prescribing is associated
with poorer practice performance on a range of
standard prescribing measures. This is unlikely to
be a direct causal relationship; it is more likely to
reflect deeper underlying features of practices that
are harder to measure, such as the extent of respect
for evidence-based practice, or the quality of team-
work around optimising treatment while managing
the prescribing budget.
