radiotherapy and chemotherapy

Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer that contributes to tumour
heterogeneity and other malignant properties. Aberrant centromere and kinetochore function
causes CIN through chromosome missegregation, leading to aneuploidy, rearrangements and
micronucleus formation. Here we develop a Centromere and kinetochore gene Expression
Score (CES) signature that quantifies the centromere and kinetochore gene misexpression in
cancers. High CES values correlate with increased levels of genomic instability and several
specific adverse tumour properties, and prognosticate poor patient survival for breast and
lung cancers, especially early-stage tumours. They also signify high levels of genomic
instability that sensitize cancer cells to additional genotoxicity. Thus, the CES signature
forecasts patient response
to adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
Our results
demonstrate the prognostic and predictive power of the CES, suggest a role for centromere
misregulation in cancer progression, and support the idea that tumours with extremely high
CIN are less tolerant to specific genotoxic therapies.

 G
enomic instability is characteristic of most human cancers
and is believed to promote other cancer hallmarks1.
The major type of genomic instability is chromosomal
instability (CIN), which is observed in both pre-cancerous
lesions and malignant growths2. CIN is characterized by
an increased frequency of chromosome abnormalities, including
gain/loss
of
whole
chromosomes
or
large
segments
(aneuploidy), structural rearrangements and focal aberrations
(for example, amplifications and deletions)3,4. These changes
can interfere with normal genome structure and function,
increase mutation frequencies and epigenetically modify gene
activity5–7.
CIN can allow the rapid accumulation of changes that
promote cancer progression, growth and heterogeneity, and
contribute to intrinsic and acquired drug resistance8–10. For
example, chromosomal translocations can generate oncogenes
that
encode
fused
or
misregulated
signalling
molecules11.
Moreover,
amplification
of
the
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
locus
contributes
to
an
acquired
resistance
to
epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors in glioblastoma
cells9. Paradoxically, extreme CIN can also hinder cell growth
or sensitize cancer cells to therapeutic agents, presumably
due
to
excess
genotoxicity
and
proteotoxicity5,12.
These
opposing effects, and the possibility of selectively killing cancer
cells displaying CIN, suggest that CIN is both a challenge to and a
potential opportunity for cancer treatment13,14.
The
exact
causes
of
CIN
in
most
sporadic
cancers
remain unclear. Proposed mechanisms include oncogene-induced
replication
stress,
breakage–fusion–bridge
cycles
induced
by
telomere
dysfunction
or
translocations,
and
aberrant
mitosis6,15–17.
Another
possible
mechanism
involves
centromeres and their associated kinetochores. These structures
are
required
for
proper
spindle
attachment,
chromosome
congression, mitotic checkpoint activity and separation of
sister
chromatids
during
mitosis18,19.
Consequently,
their
misregulation results in chromosome abnormalities and DNA
damage through various pathways, and thus may be an important
potential cause of CIN in human cancers20,21.
Centromeres
and
kinetochores
consist
of
centromeric
chromatin, as well as inner and outer kinetochore structures
(Fig. 1a). A key epigenetic mark that determines centromere
identity is CENP-A, a histone H3 variant enriched only at active
centromeres22–25. CENP-A chromatin and the outer kinetochore
are connected by the Constitutive Centromere
Associated
Network (CCAN) that contains several subcomplexes26. These
include the CENP-T/-W/-S/-X complex, which resides within
the H3 domains interspersed between blocks of CENP-A
nucleosomes27–29. CENP-C and CENP-N/-L/-M regulate the
localization of CENP-H/-I/-K, which in turn is required for
CENP-O/-P/-Q/-R/-U recruitment. The CCAN recruits the
KMN network (KNL1 complex, MIS12 complex and NDC80
complex) to the outer kinetochore, where NDC80 and other
components
interact
with
spindle
microtubules
to
ensure
proper
chromosome
segregation30,31.
All
these
centromere
and kinetochore proteins ultimately require CENP-A for their
localization22.
Maintaining
centromere
identity
requires
CENP-A
nucleosome
assembly
at
centromeres
in
each
cell
cycle.
CENP-A
assembly
relies
on
the
HJURP
chaperone
and
assembly
factor32,33
that
is
recruited
to
the
centromere
by the MIS18 complex, composed of MIS18A, MIS18B and
M18BP1 subunits34–36. This assembly also requires several
CCAN components such as CENP-C, and the CENP-H/-I/-K
and CENP-N/-L/-M
complexes35,37,38. Defects
in CENP-A
deposition cause centromere propagation failures, ultimately
producing chromosome segregation errors and aneuploidy32,33.
The levels of centromere and kinetochore proteins are tightly
regulated, and both depletion and overexpression of these proteins
can result in chromosome abnormalities and cell death22. Reduced
levels cause missegregation and chromosome gains and losses25.
Conversely, overexpression or ectopic tethering of CENP-A or
HJURP
results
in their mislocalization to non-centromeric
chromatin, generating neo-centromeres, dicentric behaviour and
chromosome
bridges
that
drive
aneuploidy,
genome
rearrangements
and
micronucleus
formation34,39–41.
Intere-
stingly, co-overexpression of CENP-A and HJURP produces
more
severe
chromosome
missegregation
and
micronuclei
phenotypes than single overexpression41, suggesting synergistic
effects
among
individual
centromere
and
kinetochore
protein genes (hereafter CEN/KT genes). Importantly, individual
overexpression of several centromeric proteins, including CENP-A,
HJURP and others correlates with poor prognosis for several
cancers, suggesting roles for these proteins in cancer aetiology42,43.
Here we test the hypothesis that misregulation of CEN/KT
genes causes chromosomal abnormalities that contribute to
tumorigenesis, and can be used as a biomarker for predicting
patient prognosis and response to therapy. We show that
overexpression of 14 CEN/KT genes is observed consistently in
a wide spectrum of cancer types, and correlates with the level of
genomic instability in diverse tumours and with adverse tumour
properties in a cancer-type-specific manner. The Centromere and
kinetochore gene Expression Score (CES) signature based on the
expression levels of the 14 CEN/KT genes not only prognosticates
cancer
patient
survival
independently
from
established
clinicopathological factors, especially for patients with early-stage
lesions,
but
also
predicts
patient
outcome
after
adjuvant
chemotherapy
or
radiotherapy.
Importantly,
these
results
suggest that although a high CES value is correlated with reduced
cancer cell tolerance to specific genotoxic therapies, it does not
confer a growth or survival disadvantage for untreated tumours.
We conclude that the CES signature is an effective prognostic
and predictive biomarker, and could be used in clinical
applications to choose effective therapeutic regimens. In addition,
these results demonstrate the importance of applying knowledge
of basic biological functions to cancer research, and suggest
that further investigations into centromere misregulation will
reveal new mechanisms involved in cancer progression.
Results
A subset of CEN/KT genes is misregulated in human cancers.
Motivated
by
the
potential
relevance
of
centromere
and
kinetochore function to genome stability and cancer aetiology, we
manually compiled a list of 31 centromere and kinetochore
(CEN/KT) protein genes (Fig. 1b) to investigate their potential
roles in cancer prognosis using the research strategy illustrated in
Fig. 1c. This list was restricted to proteins known to have an
impact on centromere or kinetochore structure and function23,
including CENP-A, downstream CCAN and KMN components,
and factors required for CENP-A nucleosome assembly and
centromere propagation (for example, HJURP and MIS18)32,33,36.
Using
Gene
Expression
Omnibus
(GEO)
databases,
we
analysed CEN/KT gene expression levels in 13 data sets from
12 different types of human cancers, including breast, lung,
liver and prostate (Supplementary Table 1). Each data set
contains both normal and tumour samples. Compared with the
corresponding normal tissues, diverse cancer types displayed
misregulation of many CEN/KT genes (Supplementary Fig. 1).

 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (Supplementary Fig. 1B,I),
suggesting that defective CEN/KT gene expression is not simply a
result
of
over-proliferation.
Furthermore,
we
performed
expression correlation network analysis using large TCGA data
sets and found that CEN/KT gene expression levels across cancer
types, and among individuals within the same type, can differ
significantly (Supplementary Fig. 2; Supplementary Note 1).
To understand the potential role of CEN/KT genes in cancer
progression, we analysed 13 Affymetrix gene expression micro-
array data sets from nine cancer types (Supplementary Data 1).
Comparing the expression levels in tumours with those in
corresponding normal tissues, and in late- versus early-stage
tumours, revealed that 15 out of 31 CEN/KT genes were
significantly misregulated (all upregulated; false discovery rate
(FDR)-adjusted Po0.05, at least twofold difference, and in at
least 50% (as empirical prevalence cutoff) data sets examined;
Fig. 1b; Supplementary Data 1). Their significant overexpression
in individual data sets was further confirmed by a permutation
test, where we computed the probability of getting CEN/KT gene
overexpression that is higher than the observed fold changes after
data randomization (Supplementary Table 2). These results
indicate that defective CEN/KT gene regulation is present among

indicated with no value and subsequently removed from all other analysis. The graph to the right shows that 15 out of 31 CEN/KTgenes are misexpressed
(fold change Z2-fold, FDR-adjusted Po0.05) in 450% of data sets for nine cancer types, specifically breast, cervical, head and neck (including
nasopharyngeal), colon, gastric, brain and CNS, liver, lung, and pancreatic cancers, compared with their corresponding normal tissues, or between late- and

 a wide array of cancers, and thus may play an important role in
aetiology and disease progression.
A subset of CEN/KT genes are prognostic for patient survival.
Next,
we
identified
a
subset
of
CEN/KT
genes
whose
misregulation offers prognostic value for cancer patients by
performing
meta-analysis
for
multiple
cancer
types
using
multiple databases. The analyses included over 3,000 human
breast
cancer
clinical
samples
(using
Breast
Cancer
Gene-Expression Miner v3.0 (BC-GenExMiner 3.0))44, and
hundreds to thousands of breast, lung, ovarian and gastric
cancer
patients
(using
the
Kaplan–Meier
(K–M)
Plotter
database)45 (Supplementary Tables 3–7; Supplementary Note 2).
Combined with the list of 15 CEN/KT genes upregulated in
multiple cancers, these results identified 14 out of 15 CEN/KT
genes whose expression levels were significantly associated with
poor patient survival and higher risk of disease progression
(Fig. 2; Supplementary Table 8). CENP-W, -L, -K, SPC24 and
NUF2 were included in the final core CEN/KT gene list because
they were identified by both differentially expressed gene analysis
across cancer types and BC-GenExMiner analysis, even though
the Affymetrix HG-U133A platform used by K–M Plotter is lack
of probes to evaluate these five genes (also see Methods).
Altogether, the list of 14 core genes contains seven genes involved
in CENP-A assembly (CENP-A, -N, -M, -K, -L, HJURP and
MIS18B), implying an important role for this biological process in
cancer progression. It also includes all four NDC80 subunits and
several other CCAN and KMN network components, but no
MIS12 complex members. These 14 genes are infrequently
mutated in cancer patients, as would be expected for essential
genes. The mutation frequencies for all 14 genes combined range
from 0 to o14% for different cancer types (Supplementary
Table 9). We find no evidence for recurrent cancer mutations
using the COSMIC database (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic),
and none of these 14 CEN/KT genes have been identified as
putative cancer mutation driver genes in recent comprehensive
analyses using TCGA and other data sets46,47. We conclude that
expression levels of many but not all CEN/KT genes are effective
prognostic factors for multiple cancers, and different CEN/KT
genes may have distinct roles in cancer aetiology.
CES correlates with genomic instability in human cancers. To
facilitate further analysis of the impact of CEN/KT misexpression
on cancer progression and outcomes, we summarized the extent
of overall pathway misregulation in samples using the CES,
calculated as the sum of the log2(mRNA expression level) for each
of the 14 CEN/KT genes (Fig. 2). Since defects in centromere and
kinetochore function lead to CIN in experimental systems22, we
analysed TCGA data sets48 for 18 different cancer types to
determine if CEN/KT gene misregulation (represented by the
CES value) correlates with the extent of genome instability
(genome fraction with copy-number alterations (CNA) and
mutation frequency). This expansive data set includes high-
quality gene expression and genomic data for many patients.
We
detected
a
significant
positive
correlation
(Spearman
correlation,
FDR-adjusted
Po0.05)
between
CES
values
and both CNA fractions and mutation frequencies for seven
cancer
types
(39%),
including
breast,
lung
and
stomach
adenocarcinomas
(ADC)
and
low-grade
brain
gliomas
(Table 1). We found that CES values significantly correlate with
either CNA fraction or mutation frequency for six cancers (33%),
including adrenocortical, head and neck, and kidney renal clear
cell carcinomas. Five of the analysed cancer data sets showed no
correlation (28%), including cervical squamous cell carcinomas
(SCCs), glioblastomas and thyroid carcinomas. Moreover, within
breast ADCs, CES values correlate with the level of genomic
instability for both invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular
carcinoma (Supplementary Table 10). Overall, we conclude that
across diverse cancer types, the CES signature significantly
correlates with the level of genome instability, consistent with
the important role of centromeres in genome maintenance across
tissues and cell types.
CES correlates with specific adverse tumour features. We next
explored the clinical information in TCGA and other microarray
data sets and found that CES is significantly associated with
several unfavourable tumour characteristics in a cancer-type-
specific manner (Table 2). We also confirmed the associations in
single data sets by box plots. For example, in breast cancer,
high CES tumours are enriched for high-grade (Po0.0001,
Kruskal–Wallis test; Supplementary Fig. 3; Table 2), ER� and
PR� status (Po0.0001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Supplementary
Fig. 4; Table 2), and more aggressive molecular subtypes (basal
like, HER2 þ versus luminal; Po0.0001, Kruskal–Wallis test;
Supplementary Fig. 5; Table 2). Moreover, breast invasive lobular
carcinomas are predominantly luminal A subtype tumours and
show significantly lower CES than invasive ductal carcinomas as
expected (Supplementary Fig. 6). More details on breast cancer
analysis are provided in Supplementary Note 3. In non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC), high CES tumours are enriched for SCC

 versus ADC, even though NSCLC histological subtype lacks
consistent prognostic value between ADC and SCC49 (Po0.0001,
Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Supplementary Fig. 7; Table 2).
Although we did not detect significant enrichment for
advanced stage (III and IV) in high CES tumours for breast or
lung cancer data sets (Table 2; Supplementary Fig. 8), we did find
that stage II tumours have higher CES values than stage I tumours
in early-stage lung ADCs (Po0.01, Wilcoxon rank-sum test;
Supplementary Fig. 8). The apparent trend of association between
stage II and high CES in TCGA breast cancer data set is primarily
due to enrichment of basal-like and HER2 þ subtypes in stage II
compared
with
stage
I
tumours
(Supplementary
Fig.
8;
Supplementary Table 11). In agreement with this notion, the
difference in CES between stages was eliminated when patients
were stratified by PAM50 subtype, but the difference among
subtypes was not eliminated when patients were stratified by stage
(Supplementary Fig. 9).
We also observed a significant association between high CES
and lymph node invasion by box plots in TCGA lung SCCs
(P ¼ 0.003, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) but not in breast cancer
data set (Table 2; Supplementary Fig. 10). Breast cancer data set
GSE3494 was excluded from the analysis due to significant
enrichment of high grade in samples with positive lymph nodes
(Po0.001, Fisher’s exact test). Overall, these findings suggest that
the genomic instability associated with high CES may contribute
to a number of important tumour properties.
CES prognosticates cancer patient survival and recurrence. We
evaluated the utility of the CES signature for prognosis of patient
survival using large, well-defined breast and lung cancer gene
expression
data
sets
across
several
microarray
platforms
(Supplementary Tables 12–13). These data sets contains relevant
clinicopathological information as well as patient survival data.
Patients for each data set were stratified into high, medium and
low CES groups by dividing the full CES range into tertiles. Then,
Kaplan–Meier survival estimation demonstrated that the CES
signature effectively predicts overall survival, distant metastasis-
free survival and relapse-free survival (Figs 3a–f and 4a–g). In
each data set, patients with higher CES values had significantly

 worse prognoses. We confirmed the significance of the CES sig-
nature by meta-analysis across cancer types using K–M Plotter
database, using automatically computed best CES thresholds to
detect the most significant difference between high and low CES
groups (Supplementary Fig. 11). Stratifying patient cohorts
according to CES tertiles in K–M Plotter produced similar results.
Notably, the CES signature effectively prognosticates patient
survival for early-stage (stage I and II combined) NSCLC and
ovarian cancer (Figs 3 and 4; Supplementary Fig. 11).
To evaluate whether CES has prognostic values independent
from established clinicopathological factors, we carried out
multivariate Cox regression using breast cancer and lung cancer
data that contain gene expression and clinical information
(Supplementary
Tables
12–14).
Individual

 and 4h; Supplementary Tables 15–27). Furthermore, Kaplan–
Meier survival analysis after patient stratification according to
various factors, including breast cancer molecular subtype and
NSCLC histological
subtype, demonstrated
that
high
CES
remains prognostic for poor patient survival in the majority of
cases, although there were several exceptions that we explore
below (see Fig. 5 and Supplementary Figs 12–15 for breast cancer,
Supplementary Figs 16–20 for NSCLC and Supplementary
Figs 21–22 for ovarian cancer). Using TCGA RNA sequencing
data, we found that the CES signature significantly prognosticates
patient survival for lung ADCs, but not for breast ADC or
lung SCCs (Supplementary Fig. 23; Supplementary Table 28).
However, the TCGA data sets currently suffer from short

CES predicts sensitivity to Topo I inhibitors in cell lines. Since
high CES cancer cells experience more severe genotoxic stress
(Table 1), they may be more sensitive to additional DNA damage
than low CES cancer cells. Thus, we mined the Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia (CCLE) data to investigate the relationship between
cancer cell line CES values and half maximal inhibitory con-
centrations (IC50s) for the Topo I inhibitors irinotecan and
topotecan, which are camptothecin analogues and damage
DNA50. After binning CCLE cell lines into quartiles according to
their CES values, we detected extremely significant differences in
drug IC50 between the top and bottom CES quartiles for both
irinotecan and topotecan (Po0.0001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test;
Fig. 6a,b; Supplementary Fig. 24). Consistently, the CES values
and drug IC50s of cancer cell lines were inversely and significantly
correlated (Spearman’s rho, rs ¼ � 0.384, Po0.001 for irinotecan;
and rs ¼ � 0.339, Po0.001 for topotecan; Table 3). This strong

 negative correlation was also found across several subgroups of
CCLE cell lines derived from specific tissues, including breast,
lung and ovarian cancer cell lines (Table 3). The inverse
correlation was further confirmed by analysing the Sanger
Institute cancer cell line camptothecin data set (Fig. 6c). We
conclude that high CES cancer cell lines are more sensitive than
low CES cell lines to Topo I inhibitors, which cause genotoxicity
and reduce cell survival—consistent with the hypothesis that high
CES scores correlate with reduced tolerance to genotoxic stress.
CES predicts patient outcome after adjuvant chemotherapy.
From the results above, we conjectured that patients with high
CES tumours are more likely to respond positively to adjuvant
genotoxic therapies, such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. We
first explored this hypothesis by determining whether adjuvant
chemotherapy is more effective for early-stage NSCLC patients
with high CES tumours, using the JBR.10 early-stage lung cancer
clinical trial data set (GSE14814)51. This clinical trial utilized a
prospective, randomized design, thus avoiding many drawbacks
associated with retrospective studies. Post-surgery stage I and II
NSCLC
patients were randomly
assigned to no adjuvant
treatment (OBS) or to adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) including
cisplatin, which causes DNA damage and promotes apoptosis,
and vinorelbine, a microtubule inhibitor51. We divided patients
into CES high (top tertile) and low (lower two tertiles) groups,
and observed that high CES predicted poor overall survival for
patients without adjuvant treatment (hazard ratio (HR) ¼ 2.728,
P ¼ 0.017), validating the prognostic power of the CES system
(Supplementary Fig. 25A). Importantly, adjuvant chemotherapy
effectively negated the adverse outcome associated with high CES
(HR ¼ 0.710, P ¼ 0.402), suggesting that the CES system also has
predictive power (Supplementary Fig. 25B). Indeed, adjuvant
therapy significantly improved overall survival for high CES

 patients compared with no treatment (HR ¼ 0.391, log-rank
P ¼ 0.035; Fig. 7a). Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that this
effect was specific for high CES patients, since there was no
significant benefit associated with adjuvant therapy for the low
CES group (HR ¼ 1.318, log-rank P ¼ 0.431; Fig. 7b). Moreover,
multivariate Cox regression analysis on patient subcohorts
stratified by CES or treatment options confirmed the prognostic
and predictive value of the CES system for early-stage NSCLC
patients (Supplementary Tables 24–25). Analysis combining the
NSCLC UT SPORE and JBR.10 data sets further strengthened
these
conclusions
(Supplementary
Fig.
26;
Supplementary
Note 5), showing that adjuvant therapy specifically improved
5-year survival for high CES, early-stage NSCLC patients (81.5%
for ACT subcohort versus 47.3% for OBS subcohort, P ¼ 0.002),
but not for the low CES group (74.4% for ACT versus 68.4% for
OBS, P ¼ 0.347). We conclude that the CES system effectively
predicts patient sensitivity to adjuvant cisplatin chemotherapy for
early-stage NSCLC.
To address potential issues associated with small sample sizes
in predicting drug sensitivity, we also performed meta-analyses
on chemo-sensitivity using K–M Plotter for several cancer types.
For both stage I NSCLCs as well as NSCLCs with all stages
included, high CES predicted poor survival for patients who did
not receive chemotherapy, but not for those who received
chemotherapy (Fig. 7c,d; Supplementary Figs. 27–29). These
analyses confirmed the results from the JBR.10 clinical trial data.
We next investigated CES values in ER þ
breast cancer
patients,
where
many
patients
suffer
from
relapse
after
endocrine therapy52. We found that high CES associates with
poor relapse-free survival for patients who did not receive
systemic
therapy
(HR ¼ 2.20,
P ¼ 6.5E-11),
confirming
the
prognostic value of high CES in these patients (Fig. 7e;
Supplementary Fig. 30). Moreover, CES is also prognostic for
ER þ patients treated with tamoxifen only (HR ¼ 1.87, P ¼ 2.6E-
05),
suggesting
that
genomic
instability
is
an
important
mechanism
contributing
to
relapse
among
those
patients.
However, high CES lost its significant prognostic value for
ER þ
patients
who
had
chemotherapy,
suggesting
that
chemotherapy reduced the risk of relapse for patients with
high CES ER þ
tumours relative to those with low CES
ER þ tumours, and consistent with our hypothesis that high
CES values predict improved patient response to adjuvant
chemotherapy.
In some breast cancer patient cohorts such as high-grade, ER �
or basal-like and HER2 subtypes, high CES either: (1) did not
have significant prognostic value or (2) predicted better survival
(Fig. 5; Supplementary Figs 12–14). Notably, these cohorts are
enriched for tumours with high CES values (Table 2). We
suspected that this unusual relationship between CES and patient
survival stemmed from the sensitivity of high CES tumours to the
genotoxic stress added by the treatment. To investigate this
hypothesis, we explored high-grade (that is, grade 3) breast cancer
cohorts with relatively large sample numbers. The grade 3 cohort
displayed higher median and average CES values than lower-
grade breast cancers (Table 2; Supplementary Fig. 3). In untreated
grade 3 patients, there was a trend indicating that high CES
remained a risk factor for poor patient survival with or without
significance. However, in treated grade 3 patients, those with high
CES showed better survival than those with lower CES (Fig. 7f;
Supplementary Fig. 31). Thus, among breast cancer patients with
high-grade tumours who were treated by adjuvant chemotherapy,
those with the highest CES values were associated with better
survival. This relationship between CES values and patient
survival was also evident in ER� breast cancers (mainly basal-
like and HER2 þ subtypes) (Fig. 7g; Supplementary Fig. 32), as
well as in lung SCC or stage II NSCLC patients that are enriched

 for high CES tumours (Fig. 5c,d; Supplementary Figs 16 and 17).
Moreover, the improved overall survival associated with high CES
in lymph node-positive breast cancer patients is probably because
there was significant enrichment for high grade (P ¼ 0.003 for
GSE3494 and Po0.001 for GSE20711 (ref. 53), respectively,
Fisher’s exact test) or ER� (GSE16446 (ref. 54) only studied ER �
tumours) in lymph node-positive tumours in the 3 data sets used
by the K–M Plotter database, and because all patients in the
lymph node-positive cohort were subjected to adjuvant therapies
(Supplementary Fig. 15B). Importantly, we found no evidence
that high CES is associated with significantly better survival
without
therapy.
Altogether,
our
results
suggest
that
the
correlation between extreme genomic instability and improved
survival likely results from the greater impact of genotoxic
therapy on high CES tumours, and not from high levels of
CIN per se.
We also studied the CES in ovarian cancer, where most
patients had higher-grade (grade 2 and 3) and late-stage
(III and IV) tumours, and were treated with chemotherapy
including platinum agents. Here high CES appeared to have
either: (1) no effect, or (2) was associated with better outcomes,
for cohorts including all late-stage patients or platinum-treated
late-stage patients (Figs 5f,g and 7h; Supplementary Figs. 21–22
and 33). In addition, high CES was associated with even better
overall
survival
among
patients
treated
with
topotecan
(HR ¼ 0.63, P ¼ 0.029; Fig. 7h; Supplementary Fig. 33B). Notably,
in CCLE ovarian cancer cell lines, high CES values were
significantly correlated with increased
topotecan sensitivity
(Spearman’s rho, rs ¼ � 0.469, P ¼ 0.018; Table 3). Overall, our
results demonstrate that the CES system effectively predicts
clinical response to adjuvant chemotherapies for lung, breast and
ovarian cancer patients.
CES predicts patient outcome after adjuvant radiotherapy. To
determine whether this prediction of patient response extends to
other genotoxic cancer therapies, we explored CES values for
cancer
patients
undergoing
radiation
therapy
(RT).
This
treatment exerts significant genotoxic stress, primarily through
double-stranded DNA breaks and other types of damage, and
causes apoptosis. As it is not a chemical agent, it constitutes an
alternative test of our hypothesis that high CES scores are
associated with increased vulnerability to genotoxic stress. Using
breast cancer Gray data set42, we found that patients with high
CES values displayed improved overall survival (HR ¼ 0.279,
P ¼ 0.008) and disease-free survival (DFS; HR ¼ 0.254, P ¼ 0.016)
after RT, compared with patients not treated with RT (Fig. 7b).
Importantly, in contrast, patients with low CES values showed
no survival benefit with RT (HR ¼ 1.309, P ¼ 0.58 for OS, and
HR ¼ 0.950, P ¼ 0.98 for DFS). The intermediate CES patient
group
associated
with
intermediate
hazards
(HR ¼ 0.370,
P ¼ 0.085 for OS, and HR ¼ 0.389, P ¼ 0.16 for DFS). Further
analyses
showed
that
the
association
between
RT
and
improved prognosis is specific to the high CES patient group
(Supplementary Fig. 34). Moreover, multivariate Cox regression
confirms the significant benefit of RT for high CES breast cancer
patients (Supplementary Table 20). Meta-data analysis further
indicates that RT treatment significantly reduces the hazard of
high
CES
for
NSCLC
patients
(Fig.
7c,d;
Supplementary
Figs 27 and 29). Thus, the CES system can predict cancer
patient outcome after both adjuvant chemotherapy and RT.
Discussion
In
this
study,
we
used
a
hypothesis-driven
approach
to
interrogate the prognostic and predictive value of centromere
and kinetochore protein gene misexpression in human cancers.
Analyses
of
numerous
cancer
databases
demonstrate
that
14 CEN/KT genes are consistently overexpressed in a wide
spectrum of human cancer types and prognosticate patient
survival. Many of these 14 CEN/KT genes are involved in the
process
of
CENP-A
nucleosome
assembly,
supporting
its
potential importance in cancer progression. To summarize the
extent of CEN/KT gene overexpression, we developed a CES (for
Centromere and kinetochore gene Expression Score) signature.
We show that high human tumour CES values are associated with
several adverse tumour properties, and predict poor patient
outcomes, including locoregional recurrence, metastatic spread
and overall survival, independently from established clinico-
pathological factors. High CES values significantly correlate with
increased levels of genomic instability (fraction of genome with
CNAs and mutation frequencies) in many different cancer types.
Thus, we hypothesized that tumours with very high CES are more
sensitive to further DNA damage, which is supported by the
observation that high CES cancer cell lines demonstrate increased
sensitivity and cytotoxicity to topoisomerase I inhibitors. We
further show that the CES signature effectively predicts outcomes
in breast and lung cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemother-
apy or radiotherapy. Thus, we conclude that the CES signature is
an effective prognostic and predictive biomarker.
We propose that clinical implementation of the CES signature
could contribute to ‘precision medicine’ by allowing more
effective therapeutic regimens to be chosen, which would
limit patient exposure to less effective therapies55. For example,
many early-stage lung cancer patients who receive adjuvant
chemotherapy after resection experience severe side effects
without significant benefit56. Consequently, the CES signature
may hold clinical value by separating responders from non-
responders to first-line adjuvant therapies that include platinum
agents. Such separation could help spare non-responders from

 the toxicity of unbeneficial therapy, and, importantly, would
promote
exploration
of
other
potentially
more
effective
therapeutic regimens for this population. CES may offer similar
clinical value in breast DCIS. The CES marker may help
identify patients at risk for recurrence, especially invasive
recurrences, as only a subset of breast DCIS display high
CEN/KT gene expression. This would allow potential de-
escalation of adjuvant therapy in low-risk patients who are
unlikely to receive significant benefit57. Validating the CES
marker’s utility in identification of high-risk DCIS will require
analysing a larger number of patients in prospective data sets.
Importantly, since centromeres are universally required for
genome stability, the CES signature can potentially be useful for
cancer types other than those examined in this study.
Our results may help elucidate the role of centromere
misregulation in cancer progression and genome instability. Half
the 14 CES genes are involved in the assembly of CENP-A
nucleosomes, which is the structural foundation for centromere
propagation
and
function.
Therefore,
misregulation
of
centromere replenishment may be a key mechanism that drives
genome instability in cancer. This idea is supported by the
observation that perturbing CENP-A nucleosome assembly in
model organisms and human cultured cells produces severe
mitotic defects32,33,58,59. Overexpression or mislocalization of key
centromere proteins generates dicentric or lagging chromosomes
and other segregation errors22,39,60. These mitotic errors also
increase
levels
of
DNA
damage
due
to
spindle-mediated
fragmentation of dicentric chromosomes, ‘cutting’ of lagging
chromosomes in cytokinesis or defective DNA repair associated
with
micronuclei
in
the
following
cell
cycle20,34,39–41,61.
Consistently, high tumour CES values were associated with
several
adverse
tumour
characteristics
and
with
increased
risk of relapse and metastasis in patients, suggesting a role for
genomic
instability
associated
with
high
CES
in
cancer
progression.
Some studies using yeast, human cancer cell lines or mouse
tumour
models
have
shown
that
genomic
instability
or
aneuploidy results in poor viability and reduced growth of
normal cells, or tumour cells not subjected to therapeutic
intervention62–64. These studies using experimental models
differ from our analyses using human clinical data and patient
survival as the end point readout. Importantly, we do not find
clinical evidence that extreme genomic instability benefits
patient survival without genotoxic therapy. Our results on cell
line drug sensitivity and patient outcome on adjuvant therapies
indicate that the elevated levels of genomic instability sensitize
cancer cells to be susceptible to genotoxic agents. A simple
explanation for these findings is that therapy elevates genomic
perturbations to a level that cannot be effectively repaired,
resulting in cancer cell death65. This provides an explanation for
the unusual correlation between extremely high CES values
and improved patient survival observed in patient cohorts
enriched
for
high
CES
tumours
that
undergo
adjuvant
therapies. Our data may also help interpret the results from a
recent prospective breast cancer clinical trial (TACT) where high
levels of CIN (measured by fluorescence in situ hybridization)
were associated with improved patient survival for ER � breast
cancer66. Importantly, in that study all ER � patients were
subjected to adjuvant therapies, and in our study we found no
evidence that high CES is associated with significantly better
patient
survival
without
therapy.
Thus,
extreme
genomic
instability in tumour cells may associate with improved survival
only for patients treated with adjuvant genotoxic therapies, a
hypothesis that merits further investigation. However, this
predictive power of the CES signature appears to also partially
temper
its
prognostic
value
for
certain
tumour
types
such as high-grade, ER � or basal-like and HER2 þ breast
cancers.
In addition to this ‘CIN threshold’ model, the involvement of
some
CES
genes
in
DNA
repair
could
provide
another
explanation for the sensitivity of high CES cancers to further
DNA damage. The CENP-A chaperone and assembly factor
HJURP (for ‘Holliday Junction Recognition Protein’) was shown
to regulate DNA repair and cell viability in cancer cell lines after
radiation42,67. The role of CENP-A in DNA repair has also been
reported but may depend on genetic and cellular contexts68,69.
Other CES proteins also may regulate DNA repair. For example,
CENP-W is a CES gene and member of the CENP-T/-W/-S/-X
complex. CENP-S/CENP-X is also known as the MHF complex
and stimulates replication fork remodelling by FANCM in DNA
repair70. It is thus conceivable that overexpression of CENP-W
favors
formation
of
the
CENP-T/-W/-S/-X
complex
and
depletes the pool of CENP-S/CENP-X available for DNA
repair or replication. If CES gene overexpression enhances
genome
instability
through
centromere
misregulation,
and
simultaneously
suppresses
effective
DNA
repair,
the
CES
signature could potentially identify patients who are extremely
sensitive to further DNA damage. In future research, it will be
interesting to determine whether the CES genes act synergistically
with other genes involved in genome maintenance, such as
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
(refs
71,72),
to
promote
cancer
progression.
Finally, one proposed strategy for cancer therapy involves
specifically killing cells that contain chromosome aberrations13.
Here we have identified a group of centromere and kinetochore
protein genes whose levels of expression strongly correlate with
cancer patient outcome and sensitivity to therapies. These
chromosomal functions are distinct from many existing drug
targets involved in signal transduction and in regulation of
oncogenic or tumour suppression pathways. Thus, these CEN/KT
proteins could provide novel drug targets that help overcome the
drug resistance caused by CIN, and may increase the effectiveness
of cancer cell responses when combined with therapies that target
signal transduction or other known oncogenic or tumour
suppression pathways.
Methods
Data sets used in this study. For identifying differentially expressed CEN/KT
genes, 13 microarray data sets containing both normal and tumour samples were
downloaded from the GEO website. Sample characteristics are summarized in
Supplementary Table 1 for the data sets used for comparison between normal and
tumour tissues by gene expression heat maps, differentially expressed gene analysis
and permutation test.
Individual breast cancer and lung cancer data sets containing gene expression,
clinical information, treatment information and survival data are summarized in
Supplementary Tables 12 and 13 for Kaplan–Meier survival estimations,
correlation study and multivariate Cox regression analysis after removing
samples of missing information. The Affymetrix probes for the 14 CES
genes are listed in Supplementary Table 30. For correlations between CES and
breast cancer ER and PR status, and molecular subtype, GSE47561 data set was
used73, which is a third party re-analysis of the meta-data set containing GSE2034,
GSE11121, GSE20194, GSE1456, GSE2603, GSE6532, GSE20437, GSE1561,
GSE7390 and GSE5847. Normalized UT SPORE NSCLC data set GSE42127 was
generously provided by Drs Yang Xie and Hao Tang74. Data sets used for Kaplan–
Meier meta-analysis (using K–M plotter) of breast (N ¼ 4,141), lung (N ¼ 2,438),
ovarian (N ¼ 1,638) and gastric (N ¼ 751) cancers are listed in Supplementary
Table 14.
For TCGA data sets, mRNA expression, fraction of CNA, frequency of
non-synonymous gene mutations in cancer exomes and patient clinical
information for the set of samples were downloaded from cBioPortal48. For the
analyses of the TCGA breast ADC data set for correlation between CES and
tumour features, we removed samples falling into any of the following categories
before analysis: low tumour purity (defined by o0.3 unless otherwise specified),
patients marked for having had neo-adjuvant therapy, samples of missing clinical
data, samples from metastatic tumours and male samples. For the TCGA lung
ADC data set, samples were removed for patients with pretreatment or unknown
pretreatment history, and patients with missing survival information.

 Gene expression heat maps and co-expression network. For heat maps,
sample clustering was performed on the CEN/KT gene expression profiles using
hierarchical clustering in Cluster 3.0 and Java Treeview 1.1.6r4 to group samples by
centroid. Gene co-expression correlation networks were constructed for each
cancer type using TCGA data sets downloaded from the cBioPortal48. A network
of CEN/KT genes was constructed using Cytoscape 2.8.0 (www.cytoscape.org)
with the ExpressionCorrelation plugin (http://baderlab.org/Software/
ExpressionCorrelation)75. Correlation coefficients exceeding a threshold (RZ0.4)
were displayed as edges between genes represented by nodes. Nodes with
fewer edges were arranged to the left of the network and those with more edges to
the right.
Kaplan–Meier plots and multivariate Cox regression analysis. For individual
breast cancer and lung cancer data sets, Kaplan–Meier curves were generated for
patients stratified into groups of high (upper tertile), intermediate (middle tertile)
and low (lower tertile) CES values. For the NSCLC JBR.10 trial and UT lung
SPORE data sets used for chemotherapy outcome prediction, the CES high patient
group consists of the top CES tertile, and the remaining two tertiles are defined as
CES low. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and multivariate Cox regression were
performed in SPSS or R. R code and the individual breast cancer and lung cancer
data sets for the Kaplan–Meier plots and multivariate Cox regression in Figs 3 and
4 are available as Supplementary Software 1. The top CES tertile and lower two CES
tertiles in the NSCLC JBR.10 and UT SPORE data sets were pooled for the Kaplan–
Meier survival analysis of sensitivity to adjuvant chemotherapy. Five-year survival
for lung cancer patients was analysed by w2-test for significance.
We performed meta-analysis for breast cancer any event survival and metastatic
relapse-free survival on 17 breast cancer data sets using bc-GenExMiner v3.0, and
for breast, lung, gastric and ovarian cancers using K–M Plotter. For meta-analysis
of the prognostic value of the CES for each cancer type and subcohorts using the
K–M Plotter database, we used automatically computed best CES thresholds to
detect the most significant difference between high and low CES groups, after
stratifying patients according to different clinicopathological factors using K–M
Plotter. For meta-analysis of sensitivity to adjuvant therapies using K–M plotter, we
used the top CES tertile as CES high, and the remaining two tertiles as CES low;
using the automatically computed best performing CES threshold showed similar
trends in most cases. The K–M Plotter database incorporates genes with probes
present in Affymetrix HG-U133A array to maximize sample sizes and ensure
comparability between data sets for meta-analysis, thus it excluded seven CEN/KT
genes (CENP-H, -W, -L, -K, -P, SPC24 and NUF2), five of which are also CES
genes (CENP-W, -L, -K, SPC24 and NUF2). Therefore, for K–M Plotter analyses
we used the nine remaining CES genes as a simplified version of the CES
signature to maximize sample sizes. Cohorts with small sample sizes (no30) were
excluded from meta-data analysis using K–M Plotter. K–M Plotter Database was
accessed in October 2015.
Statistical analysis. The Statistical Analysis of Microarrays Excel add-on package
(http://www-stat.stanford.edu/Btibs/SAM/) was used to identify differences
between normal and tumour tissues in expression levels of CEN/KT genes using
the following criteria (FDR Pr0.05, fold changes Z2, and in at least 50%
(as the empirical prevalence cutoff threshold) data sets examined. For identification
of differentially expressed CEN/KT gene probes in Supplementary Data 1, all
microarray data were determined to be normally distributed. Permutation tests
were performed in R to confirm significant overexpression of CES genes identified
by the DE gene analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences version 11.5 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL), Graphpad
Prism, or R version 3.0.2.
Significant associations between CES values and clinicopathological factors
were evaluated by a Wilcoxon rank-sum test for two-group comparison and a
Kruskal–Wallis test for multiple groups. For CCLE and CGP drug sensitivity data,
significant differences in IC50s between the top and bottom CES quartiles were
determined by a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. For Sanger Institute CGP cell line drug
sensitivity to camptothecin, samples with extreme IC50 values were excluded from
the analysis. Extreme IC50s were defined by three times of a robust location-free
scale estimate above the median that is more efficient than median absolute
deviation, and is more resistant to extreme or outlier data points than 3 s.d. above
the population mean76.
