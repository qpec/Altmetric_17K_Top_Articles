Abstract
To date, very few studies have reported on the relationship between live birth gender and em-
bryo development kinetics. This study included 1735 women undergoing in vitro fertilization or
intracytoplasmic sperm injection by using a time-lapse system. Finally, a total of 228 qualified
patients with 100% implantation and known live birth information were included in the analysis.
There were 174 male live births and 134 female live births. The time to 3 (t3), 4 (t4), and 5 (t5) cell
development of male embryos was significantly shorter/earlier than female embryos (P < 0.05).
The duration of the second cell cycle (cc2) in male embryos was significantly shorter than female
embryos (P = 0.002). Multivariate logistic regression showed that only t3 had a significant cor-
relation with live birth gender; the odds ratio (OR) was 0.786, 95% confidence interval (CI) was
0.625–0.988 (P < 0.05). When morphokinetic parameters were divided into groups based on quar-
tiles, embryos within the sex ranges were observed to have significantly different proportions of
male and female live births (P < 0.05). The results showed that t3 (<14 h) was the most relevant
parameter related to live birth gender (OR 2.452, 95% CI 1.071–5.612, P = 0.03). These findings
support the idea that embryo morphokinetic parameters were affected by the sex of the embryo.
Currently, embryologists use embryo morphokinetics to establish models of development, in order
to improve accurate selection of viable embryos. Thus, this factor needs to be considered when
embryologists use embryo morphokinetics to select embryos.
Summary Sentence

be considered when embryologists use embryo morphokinetics to select embryos.
Key words: live birth gender, time-lapse, embryo cleavage kinetics, embryo selection.

Introduction
In the past 30 years, great changes have taken place in assisted re-
productive technology (ART). Since the advent of successful in vitro
fertilization (IVF), the process of fertilization and subsequent embryo
culture has moved from the test tube, held in sealed glass desiccators
in “warming cabinets,” to IVF with specially placed dishes in incu-
bators [1]. In order to maximize the success rates of IVF cycles, the
best embryos are needed to maximize the possibility of a successful
pregnancy. Most methods of embryo evaluation are based on mor-
phologic criteria, including assessment of morphologic parameters,
such as cell size, cell number, symmetry, percentage of fragments,
defects of cytoplasm, and multinucleation [2–5]. However, there are
few studies that have reported on the relationship between these
morphologic parameters and human embryo sex. In other words,
whether sex ratio affected the embryo development parameters.
Several human studies have examined the kinetics of male and
female embryo development. Some have shown that male embryos
have faster development than female embryos [3, 6–9]. But other
studies report no significant difference in embryo development be-
tween male and female embryos [10–13]. There is also still contro-
versy, in the literature, regarding the kinetics of embryos in animal
studies. Some investigators reported that sex could affect the kinetics
of embryo development and others failed to find a correlation be-
tween embryo sex and the kinetics of embryo development [14–19].
Therefore, to date, the results for both humans and animals have
been inconclusive.
However, all of these prior studies were based on traditional mor-
phologic assessment. More recently, the introduction of time-lapse
technology has allowed us to observe the whole cleavage process in
real time and not just isolated points [20–22]. We could obtain more
information on morphokinetic parameters of the embryo and iden-
tify any sex-related differences. There are very few studies that have
reported on the relationship between live birth gender and embryo
development kinetics using time-lapse technology. Serdarogullari
et al. compared the gender-specific embryo development characteris-
tics from 78 female and 60 male embryos. They found no significant
differences between the sexes regarding each cell division time or
interval between consecutive events [23]. Perhaps, more data are
needed.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to retrospectively an-
alyze the time-lapse data from our IVF center and to determine
whether implanted embryo development kinetics was associated with
live birth sex.
Materials and methods
Patients
The present research is a retrospective observational study, which
was conducted at the Reproductive Medical Center of Tongji Hos-
pital between 2014 and 2016. A total of 1335 patients were enrolled.
All patients gave written informed consent. All patients in this study
underwent routine treatment and no additional intervention was
performed.
Ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval
Ovarian stimulation was performed as described previously by this
study group [24]. Recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin
(hCG) (250 mg; Ovidrel; Serono) was given to trigger ovulation when
two leading follicles reached a mean diameter of 18 mm. Oocytes
were retrieved transvaginally 34–36 h after hCG administration.
Fertilization and embryo culture
The processes of sperm preparation, IVF, and embryo culture have
been described previously [25]. Briefly, semen were collected by mas-
turbation after 3–5 days of sexual abstinence and then maintained
at 37◦C for 30 min. After liquefaction, the samples were assessed for
concentration, motility, and morphology according to World Health
Organization criteria. Fertilized oocytes were continuously cultured
in G1 medium (Vitrolife) for 3 days. All embryos were cultured under
an atmosphere of 6.0% CO2. Patients with severe oligozoospermia
or polyspermia, more than 75% in a previous IVF cycle, received in-
tracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In the ICSI cycles, the corona
radiata and cumulus cells of the oocytes were removed by brief ex-
posure (10–15 s) to hyaluronidase 2 h after retrieval, and ICSI was
performed on metaphase II (MII) oocytes. Usually, fewer than two
best-quality embryos were transferred on day 3 after oocyte retrieval,
and excess good-quality embryos were cryopreserved for subsequent
frozen-embryo transfer (FET) cycles.
The frozen–embryo transfer cycles
The FET cycles were from both natural cycles after spontaneous
ovulation and hormone replacement treatment (HRT) cycles. The
process of both cycles was performed as described previously [26].
Briefly, for the natural cycles, transvaginal ultrasound scans and
measurement of the serum progesterone levels were initiated from
day 10–12 to assess endometrial thickness, follicle growth, and ovu-
lation. FET was planned for 3 days after ovulation. For the HRT cy-
cles, oral estradiol (Progynova, Bayer) was provided, 2 mg/d for cycle
days 1–4, 4 mg/d for days 5–8, and 6 mg/d for days 9–12. Endome-
trial thickness and ovulation were assessed on day 13; the estradiol
dosage was adjusted based on the endometrial thickness. Adminis-
tration of 40 mg progesterone intramuscularly was given when the
endometrium reached a thickness of 8 mm. Embryo transfer was
performed on day 4, after 3 days of progesterone administration.
Morphokinetic parameters
Images were recorded every 5 min in nine different focal planes for
72 h of culture using the Primo Vision system (Vitrolife). In order to
increase the size of the studied cohorts, patients in this study under-
went IVF and ICSI were all included. The exact fertilized times (t0)
for each embryo from IVF and ICSI might be different. However, it
was proved that this difference disappeared when pronuclear fading
(PNF) was used as t0 [27, 28]. In this study, PNF was used as t0 to all
cycles in order to normalize a common point in time, which permit-
ted the joint analysis of IVF and ICSI embryos. Time-lapse images
of all embryos were retrospectively analyzed using a Primo Vision
software workstation. According to Meseguer et al. [20], morphoki-
netic parameters included the appearance of two pronuclei, PNF,
when both pronuclei became invisible, division to two cells (t2), and
subsequently to three cells (t3), four cells (t4), five cells (t5), six cells
(t6), seven cells (t7), and eight cells (t8). The time interval of events
such as the second cell cycle (cc2 = t3 – t2), third cell cycle (cc3 = t5
– t3), interval between two and five cells (t5 – t2). Second synchrony
(s2 = t4 – t3) as the time from division into a three-blastomere em-
bryo to division into a four-blastomere embryo and third synchrony
(s3 = t8 – t5) were also calculated.

Outcome measures
Serum βhCG was used for the determination of a pregnancy 14 days
after embryo transfer; this level was subsequently tested serially to
monitor the rise in titer. A clinical pregnancy was defined as the
presence of a gestational sac with fetal heart activity on ultrasound
examination 4–5 weeks after oocyte retrieval. The neonatal outcome
data were obtained from a telephone interview with the parents after
delivery. The questionnaire obtained information for birth hospital,
gestational weeks, sex, birth weight, and presence of congenital birth
defects.
Statistical analysis
All data analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for
the Social Sciences version 13.0 (SPSS). Between-group data were an-
alyzed using the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-test. Multivariate
logistic regression analysis was used to study the association between
morphokinetic parameters and live birth sex. Statistical significance
was established at P < 0.05. In order to describe the distribution of
the probability of embryo gender, times value were transformed from
continuous variables into categorical variables by dividing them into
groups based on quartiles. Using this method, the bias caused by
differences in the number of embryos in each category was avoided.
Then, the percentage of embryo sex for each time quartile was de-
termined to assess the distribution of sex in the different categories.
The chi-squared test was used to compare categorical data. For each
time-point and time-interval events variable, the optimal sex range
was defined as the combined range spanned by the two quartiles or
as the range spanned by one quartile with the highest proportion of
embryo sex. A binary variable was defined by the value of time vari-
able inside or outside the optimal range. The odds ratio (OR) of the
effect of all binary variables generated for the male live birth group
was expressed in terms of the 95% confidence interval (95% CI)
and significance. The effect of binary variables on the male live birth
group was quantified by logistic regression analysis. The receiver op-
erating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC)
were used to test the predictive value of all variables included in the
model with respect to live birth sex.
Results
A total of 1735 cycles were monitored by the time-lapse system in
this study. Embryos transfer resulted in <100% implantation; all of
the implanted twins with two different genders (male/female) were
excluded from the analysis. Finally, a total of 228 qualified patients
with 100% implantation and known live birth information were
included in the analysis. There were 129 patients with 174 male live
births (male embryos, n = 174) and 99 patients with 134 female
live births (female embryos, n = 134). Table 1 shows the general
characteristics of patients and cycles. A total of 3003 oocytes were
retrieved, and 308 embryos were transferred to the uterus.
Table 2 shows the embryo morphokinetic parameters and time
interval of events according to point in time. The findings showed
that the development of male embryos was faster than female em-
bryos. The male embryos in t3, t4, and t5 were significantly earlier
than female embryos (P < 0.05). In addition, the duration of sec-
ond cell cycle (cc2) in male embryos was significantly shorter than
female embryos (P = 0.002). The morphokinetic parameters of third
cell cycle (t6, t7, and t8) and duration of the third cell cycle (cc3) were
similar in both sex groups. Furthermore, early cleavage synchrony
(s2 and s3) of male and female embryos was similar.
To assess the association between morphokinetic parameters and
live birth sex, multivariate logistic regression was performed and
the reference category was the female group (Table 3). The results
showed that only t3 had a significant correlation with live birth sex,
OR was 0.786 (95% CI 0.625–0.988, P < 0.05).
As described above, all morphokinetic parameter values were
transformed from continuous variables to categorical variables by
dividing them into groups based on quartiles, in order to determine
the distribution of the probability of embryo sex. The results in
Table 4 show the distribution in detail. Embryos falling within the
sex ranges for t3 < 14 h, t4 < 15.76 h, t5 < 30.92 h, cc2 < 12.12 h,
or t5-t2 < 28.34 h were observed to have significantly different
proportions of male and female live births (P < 0.05).
Furthermore, binary logistic regression analysis was used to de-
termine the relevance of these observed time parameters (expressed
as binary variables inside or outside the defined ranges) to the higher
probability of male embryos. The results showed that t3 (OR 2.452,

Discussion
The purpose of this study was to analyze the time-lapse data from
implanted embryos and to observe the relationship between embryo
development kinetics and live birth sex. The results of this study
show that the development of male embryos was faster than fe-
male embryos, especially considering morphokinetic parameters of
t3. Male embryos appear to develop faster than female embryos;
however, the data are still controversial. Unlike static prior obser-
vations, the current study used morphokinetic recordings (at 5-min
intervals), which allowed us to observe the whole cleavage process
in real time.
Bronet et al. [29] obtained 421 embryos sex information by using
compressive chromosome screening (CCS). They reported that all of
the embryo developmental kinetics was similar for the male/female
groups. Furthermore, they found that embryos falling within the
ranges for s2 > 2 h and the timing of morula formation (tM) 80.8–
98.3 h exhibited significantly different proportions of male and fe-
male embryos. However, the embryo sex information was based on
CCS, not live birth results. Live birth data has a more direct role in
the analysis of the relationship between morphokinetic parameters
and sex. Another study reported by Serdarogullari et al. obtained
data from 78 female and 60 male embryos, according to the live
birth information. The analysis regarding each morphokinetic pa-
rameter according to sex indicated that they were all similar in cell
division kinetics, from the early cleavage to blastocyst stage [23]. In
the present study, we focused on live birth information; some fac-
tors differ from Serdarogullari’s study. We found differences in the
embryo developmental rate. The results from both multivariate and
binary logistic regression found that t3 had a significant correlation
to live birth sex. Therefore, live birth sex appears to be correlated
with morphokinetic parameters.
During preimplantation development, male and female embryos
could display phenotypic differences that might be attributed to the
transcriptional differences resulting from their different sex chromo-
some complements [30]. Both Y-linked genes and those X-linked
genes play an important role in the early embryonic developmental
patterns. Such differences might explain the different developmental
rates of male and female embryos.
However, the embryo culture environment might affect the sex-
specific differences in morphokinetic parameters. For IVF-ET treat-
ments, there were different culture environments mainly referred to
brands of culture medium as well as the concentration of CO2 and
O2. In present study, all embryos were cultured in cleavage medium
from Vitrolife, with 6.0% CO2 and 20% O2, which was different
from Bronet’s study (Life Global, 6.3% CO2 and 20% O2) and Ser-
darogullari’s study (Irvine Scientific, 6.0% CO2 and 5% O2). These
differences might lead investigators to observe different morphoki-
netics. A recent study observed the dynamics of early development
using time-lapse analysis of embryos cultured in different media [31].
The results demonstrated that embryo culture media might have an
effect on early morphokinetics depending on the composition of the
ingredients. The media ingredients might affect cell cycle of embryos
through metabolic pathways and/or repair mechanisms. Morbeck
et al. determined the composition of commercially available cul-
ture media, including Cook, In Vitro Care, Origio, Sage, Vitrolife,
Irvine CSC, and Global [32]. They used mouse embryos to determine
whether differences in the composition of these media are biologi-
cally relevant. The results indicated that culture media composition
varies widely, with differences in pyruvate, lactate, and amino acids
especially notable. The development of mouse embryos was differen-
tially affected by these culture media. This hypothesis has been sup-
ported by a recent study demonstrating that IVF culture media may
also affect human intrauterine growth [33]. The results implied that
as composition may vary among various commercial culture media,
data obtained in the current study are subject to change in differ-
ent studies utilizing other brands of media. Furthermore, Kirkegaard
et al. [34] observed the effect of oxygen concentration on embryo
development and indicated that, compared with 5% O2, the culture

of embryos in 20% O2 reduced the developmental rate. Therefore,
it should be noted that not only the culture media but also the
oxygen concentration might have an effect on embryo metabolism
and development. However, whether oxygen concentration affected
gender-specific embryo morphokinetics remains to be studied.
Furthermore, currently, more laboratories use embryo morphoki-
netics to establish models of development, in order to improve ac-
curate selection of viable embryos or predict the risk of aneuploidy
[35]. Meseguer et al. [20] reported that six discriminative morphoki-
netic parameters were identified (t2, t3, t4, t5, cc2, and s2) for a set
of 247 transferred embryos with either full or no implantation. For
each of the identified parameters, the optimal range was defined as
the two quartiles with the highest frequency of implantation. They
found that there was a significant difference in probability of implan-
tation among embryos within the optimal range as opposed to those
outside the range. Other studies also defined ranges of t3, t5, cc2, s2
as “time-lapse marker” to design embryo morphokinetic selection
models [36]. In the present study, we found that the morphokinetic
parameters (t3, t4, t5, and cc2) of male embryos were significantly
earlier than those of female embryos (P < 0.05). So, we should ask
about the implications for these embryo selection models, which may
affect the sex ratio of live births. Furthermore, Bronet et al. reported
that [29] future studies must be done to depict any possible effect.
In conclusion, our findings show that the development of male
embryos was faster than that of female embryos, especially during
the morphokinetic parameter t3. This is the first report that shows
a significant correlation between live birth sex and morphokinetic
parameters. Therefore, when we design time-lapse selection models
to improve IVF success rates, we should consider that the selected
embryo development kinetics might affect the live birth sex ratio.
However, these findings need to be further evaluated in more ex-
tensive studies. Further studies are needed to validate whether these
results are also similar in different culture systems.
