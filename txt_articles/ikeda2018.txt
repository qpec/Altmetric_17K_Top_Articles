ABSTRACT
Background After injury, mesenchymal progenitors in the kidney interstitium differentiate into myofibroblasts,
cells that have a critical role in kidney fibrogenesis. The ability to deliver genetic material to myofibroblast
progenitors could allow new therapeutic approaches to treat kidney fibrosis. Preclinical and clinical studies show
that adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) efficiently and safely transduce various tissue targets in vivo; however,
protocols for transduction of kidney mesenchymal cells have not been established.
Methods We evaluated the transduction profiles of various pseudotyped AAV vectors expressing either
GFP or Cre recombinase reporters in mouse kidney and human kidney organoids.
Results Of the six AAVs tested, a synthetic AAV called Anc80 showed specific and high-efficiency transduction
of kidney stroma and mesangial cells. We characterized the cell specificity, dose dependence, and expression
kinetics and showed the efficacy of this approach by knocking out Gli2 from kidney mesenchymal cells by
injection of Anc80-Cre virus into either homozygous or heterozygous Gli2-floxed mice. After unilateral ureteral
obstruction, the homozygous Gli2-floxed mice had less fibrosis than the Gli2 heterozygotes had. We observed
the same antifibrotic effect in b-catenin–floxed mice injected with Anc80-Cre virus before obstructive injury,
strongly supporting a central role for canonical Wnt signaling in kidney myofibroblast activation. Finally, we
showed that the Anc80 synthetic virus can transduce the mesenchymal lineage in human kidney organoids.
Conclusions These studies establish a novel method for inducible knockout of floxed genes in mouse
mesangium, pericytes, and perivascular fibroblasts and are the foundation for future gene therapy ap-
proaches to treat kidney fibrosis.

 forms of blindness.2–6 In 2017, the US Food and Drug Admin-
istration approved the first gene therapy on the basis of an
AAV vector for the treatment of a form of inherited retinal
degeneration.7
Broader application of AAV gene therapy is limited by in-
complete understanding of viral tropism. Recent efforts to
engineer AAV vectors have shown that transduction efficiency
can be improved and that tropism can be modified.8 Systemic
injection of AAV achieves efficient transduction in several or-
gans but not kidney, irrespective of capsid protein.9–15 Arterial
injection of AAV2 transduces the proximal tubules of the kid-
ney but at low efficiency.16–20 Either intravenous or in utero
administration of AAV9 has been reported to transduce the
proximal tubules, podocytes, and glomerular endothelium,21–24
and retrograde ureteral delivery results in transduction of tubu-
lar epithelium.25 Similarly, injection of AAV2 or -8 via the retro-
grade ureteral or pelvic approach transduces proximal tubule.26,27
Thus, various AAVs have been shown to transduce kidney epithe-
lia, but efficiency is generally low; they may require arterial or
ureteraladministration,andnoprotocoltodatehasdemonstrated
transduction of kidney mesenchymal cells.
In this study, we systematically evaluated different AAV
serotypes for their ability to deliver genetic material to kidney
pericytes and fibroblasts, the myofibroblast progenitor popu-
lations.28 We report that the synthetic AAVAnc80 efficiently
transduces kidney mesenchymal cells, including pericytes, fi-
broblasts, and mesangial cells. We validate use of Anc80 for
gene transfer by knocking out Gli2 from kidney mesenchyme
using Anc80-Cre, confirming an antifibrotic effect after
chronic obstruction. We implicate the b-catenin pathway in
myofibroblast expansion, because knockout of mesenchymal
b-catenin expression using the same strategy was also antifi-
brotic. Finally, we show successful mesenchymal cell transduc-
tion in human kidney organoids, suggesting that Anc80 may
be useful for targeting this lineage in humans.
METHODS
AAV Preparation and Injection
Native AAV-2/2 and alternative serotypes AAV5, -6, -8, and -9 and
Anc80 were generated with either the CMVor the synthetic CASI
promoter. Transgenes were CMV.eGFP.WPRE, CASI.eGFP.
WPRE, or CASI.Cre.WPRE. AAV production and titration were
performed by the Gene Transfer Vector Core (http://vector.meei.
harvard.edu/) at the Grousbeck Gene Therapy Center at the
Schepens Eye Research Institute and Massachusetts Eye and Ear
Infirmary as described previously.8,29 Briefly, allAAV preparations
were made by plasmid cotransfection in human embryonic kid-
ney 293 cells using polyethyleneimine. The packaging plasmid
AAV Rep2-CapX (X indicating the serotype) was cotransfected
with an AAV2 ITR-flanked transgene and adenohelperconstructs.
Three days after transfections, cells and media were harvested and
underwent lysis and digestion with Benzonase. Viral vector was
further purified from the lysate by tangential flow filtration and
iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation before reformulation in
PBS.8,29 A final volume of 100 ml per mouse was injected via
the retro-orbital venous plexus.
Animal Experiments
All mouse experiments were performed according to the an-
imal experimental guidelines issued by the Animal Care and
Use Committee at Washington University. Gli2-flox (JAX
#007926), Rosa26tdTomato (JAX #007909), b-catenin–flox
(JAX #004152), and C57BL/6J (JAX #000664) mice were pur-
chased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Anes-
thesia was achieved with continuous evaporated isoflurane
(2%) using Anesthesia System RC2 (922100; VetEqip) during
surgery. Buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg), meloxicam (1 mg/kg),
and lidocaine (1%) were given subcutaneously to achieve an-
algesia. Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) surgery was as
follows. After flank incision, the right kidney was exposed and
freed from the perirenal fat tissue, and the ureter was tied off at
the level of the lower pole using two 4.0 silk ties. Wounds were
closed by staples. Mice were euthanized 10 days after UUO
surgery. UUO surgeries in C57Bl6 wild-type mice were per-
formed at 8 weeks of age using the same technique. For char-
acterization of kidney transduction efficiency and dose, all
experiments used three mice, except for the dose of 1012 ge-
nome copies (GCs) per mouse, which used n=2 due to
cost. For the Gli2 experiments, both groups had n=6. For
the b-catenin and lineage-tracing experiments, both groups
had n=4.
Tissue Preparation and Histology
Mice were anesthetized with isofluorane (Baxter) and sub-
sequently perfused via the left ventricle with 4°C PBS for 1
minute. For histologic analyses, tissue sections were fixed in
10% formaldehyde for 1 hour, paraffin embedded, cut with a
rotating microtome at a thickness of 3 mm, and stained ac-
cording to routine histologic protocols. For immunofluores-
cence studies, kidneys were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
on ice for 1 hour and then incubated in 30% sucrose in PBS
at 4°C overnight. OCT-embedded (Sakura Finetek) tissues
were cryosectioned into 5-mm sections and mounted on su-
perfrost slides (Fisher Scientific). Sections were washed in
Significance Statement
Almost 50 years after it was first proposed, gene therapy is now
entering into regular clinical use. The most common method of
delivery of genetic material for gene therapy approaches is the
adeno-associated virus (AAV). A major gap in the field has been the
lack of an AAV capable of transducing the kidney. This paper reports
the first systematic examination of AAV subtypes for delivery of
genetic material to the kidney. The study identifies a synthetic AAV
(Anc80) with efficient transduction of kidney pericytes and peri-
vascular fibroblasts and reports on dosing, timing, and cell speci-
ficity. Anc80 is shown to be able to delete floxed genes in mouse
mesenchymal cells and transduce kidney mesenchymal cells in hu-
man kidney organoids, providing a proof of principle for use in
humans.

 13 PBS, blocked in 10% normal goat serum (Vector Labs),
and incubated with primary antibodies (Supplemental
Table 1). Secondary antibodies were FITC or Cy3 conjugated
(Jackson ImmunoResearch). Sections were then stained with
49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and mounted in Prolong
Gold (Life Technologies). All images were obtained by con-
focal imaging (Nikon C2+).
Real Time PCR Experiments
Tissue was harvested and immediately snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen. RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and 600 ng
of total RNA was reverse transcribed with iScript (BioRad).
During the RNA extraction, DNA was removed by a DNAse
digestion step (Life Technologies). Quantitative PCRs were
carried out with iQ-SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad) and
the Applied Biosystems 7300 Teal-Time PCR System. Cy-
cling conditions were 95°C for 3 minutes and then 40
cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute followed
by one cycle of 95°C for 10 seconds. Glyceraldehyde-
3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a housekeeping
gene. Data were analyzed using the 22DDct method. Primers
are listed in Supplemental Table 2.
Western Blot
Protein was extracted from tissues or cells with RIPA or urea
lysis buffer (urea: 8 M) with cOmplete Mini Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Proteins samples were separated in
standard SDS polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinyli-
dene difluoride membranes, and incubated with primary an-
tibodies with 5% skim milk or 3% BSATBST buffer for 2 hours
at room temperature or overnight at 4°C followed by the re-
action with secondary antibody dissolved in 5% skim milk
TBST buffer for 1 hour at room temperature. Goat anti-mouse
(P0447), goat anti-rabbit (P0448), or rabbit anti-goat (P0449)
Igs conjugated with HRP (DAKO) were used as secondary
antibodies. For developing the signal, ECL Plus Western Blot-
ting Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology) or SuperSignal West
Femto Maximal Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology)
was used according to the manufacturer’s instruction, and the
signals were detected using the ChemDoc Detection System
(BioRad).
Quantification of Fluorescent Reporter Proteins
Mesangial and cortical interstitial areas were focused to quan-
tify the fraction of fluorescent reporter proteins. At least six
different areas in cortex were taken, and percentage of fluo-
rescent protein–positive area per PDGFRb-positive area was
calculated using Nikon NIS elements.
Clonal Analyses
Five-week-old male mice were injected with a low dose of AAV
(1010 GCs per mouse) followed by 3 weeks of incubation.
UUO surgery was performed, and mice were euthanized 10
days after surgery; 15-mm-thick frozen sections were directly
stained with 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and then ana-
lyzed using confocal microscopy. Coherent clusters of tdTo-
mato-positive cells were counted for total cell number by
DAPI counterstaining.
Statistical Analyses
Data are presented as mean6SD. Comparison of two groups
was performed using unpaired t tests. Paired t tests were used
for comparison of repeated measures in the same group. Sta-
tistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0c
(GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). A P value of ,0.05
was considered significant.
RESULTS
In Vivo Kidney Transduction by AAV Variants
Thecapsidproteinisamajordeterminantofcellulartropism,and
we generated a panel of hybrid AAV vectors using the genome of
the approved AAV serotype 2 and capsid proteins from AAV
serotypes 5, 6, 8, and 9. We generated an additional AAV using
thesyntheticcapsidproteinAnc80,whichhasbeenengineeredto
reduce antigenic epitopes and has been shown to have unique
transduction characteristics.8,30–32 All AAV serotypes contained
the same CMV.eGFP.WPRE transgene construct. We reasoned
that systemic delivery would be most practical for future clinical
application, and therefore, all studies were conducted with in-
travenous administration; unless noted otherwise, we evaluated
transduction 3 weeks after injection. Using a dose of 1011 GCs
per mouse, we confirmed efficient transduction by AAV2/8 and
AAV2/Anc80 of liver, with lower levels in heart, lung, and kidney
(Figure 1A, Supplemental Figure 1). AAV2/8 and AAV2/Anc80
were the only AAV serotypes to exhibit kidney transduction,
with Anc80 achieving three- to fivefold higher transduction
than AAV8. GFP expression was primarily interstitial and en-
riched in the outer medulla.
We further characterized Anc80 cellular tropism in the kid-
ney by immunofluorescence staining. GFPexpressionwas lim-
ited to interstitial, glomerular, and juxtaglomerular regions.
Interstitial GFP-positive cells uniformly expressed PDGFRb,
indicating a pericyte and fibroblast identity (Figure 1B). In the
glomerulus, GFP-positive cells were WT1 negative and
PDGFRb positive, consistent with mesangium (Figure 1B).
The only epithelial cells transduced were always found in
a tubule adjacent to the glomerulus in cells that express
the Na+:K+:2Cl– cotransporter Solute Carrier Family 12
Member 1, indicating the thick ascending limb. Intriguingly,
only a subset of epithelia was transduced, however, and these
were always cells adjacent to renin and nitric oxide synthase
1–expressing cells that themselves were not transduced (Fig-
ure 1C). These results indicate that AAV Anc80 efficiently
transduces a subset of epithelia in the thick ascending limb
adjacent to the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA).
We next asked whether the synthetic CASI promoter, con-
sisting of a truncated CMV enhancer, chicken b-actin

 promoter, and UBC enhancer as well as splice donor and splice
acceptor sequences, could increase sensitivity to detect trans-
duction compared with the CMV promoter. Although overall
kidney cell tropism was unchanged, we observed much better
pericyte and fibroblast transduction with the CASI promoter
compared with the CMV promoter (18% versus 4% of
PDGFRb-positive cells, respectively) (Figure 1, D and E). By
contrast, mesangial cell transduction was somewhat reduced
with the CASI promoter. Quantitation of transduction effi-
ciencies between AAV2/2 and AAV2/Anc80 with either CMV
or CASI promoters is shown in Figure 1, H and I. eGFP ex-
pression in JGA epithelia was detectable within 1 week of in-
jection of AAV2/Anc80, whereas expression in mesangium
and interstitium required 2 weeks for detection. Expression
in mesangium increased from 2 to 4 weeks,
whereas interstitial expression remained
constant over this timeframe (Supplemen-
tal Figure 2).
Enhanced Sensitivity to Detect Gene
Delivery by AAV-Cre
The fact that the CASI promoter increased ap-
parent transduction efficiency compared with
the CMV promoter suggested that we might
lack adequate sensitivity to accurately measure
viraltransductionusingaGFPreportersystem.
We reasoned that AAVencoding Cre recombi-
nase in combination with a reporter mouse
might provide superior sensitivity. We, there-
fore, generated AAV driving expression of Cre
recombinase and injected 331011 GC per
mouse into R26-tdTomato reporter mice. We
observed very strong expression in all three
kidney cell types (pericytes/fibroblasts,
mesangial cells, and JGA), and overall trans-
duction efficiency was far superior compared
with AAV-GFP (Figure 1, F and G). Impor-
tantly, there was no transduction of peritubu-
lar endothelial cells in either the medulla
(Figure1F)orthecortex(SupplementalFigure
3). Anc80-Cre could transduce nearly 70%
of interstitial pericytes and perivascular
fibroblasts and nearly 90% of mesangium
(Figure 1J). A dose-response study of AAV2/
Anc80-Cre revealed increasing transduction
through the highest dose tested (331011 GC
per mouse) (Supplemental Figure 4).
We next investigated whether AAV causes
adverse effects on uninjured kidney and other major organs.
Somewhat surprisingly, our studies showed that AAV8 and the
CASI.GFP.WPRE cassette (but not the CMV.GFP.WPRE
cassette) led to liver toxicity at 1012 GC per mouse, including
hepatocyte hypertrophy with nuclear swelling, monocellular in-
filtrationalong central veins, and bridging fibrosis (Figure 2A). It
was unclear whether this toxicity was related to the vector or the
expression of the transgene, but it was somewhat reflective of the
previous findings on AAV8 by Wang et al.33 We also observed
evidenceofspontaneous myofibroblasttransition innormal kid-
neys at the 1012 GC per mouse dose of the same AAV8 and
cassette. This was evident by both upregulated expression of
aSMA and immunofluorescence and increased mRNA encod-
ing both aSMA and fibronectin (Figure 2, B–D). Of note, kidney
endothelial marker endomucin revealed no detectable transduction of endothelium by AAV. (G) High efficincy transduction of mesangium

 histologic abnormalities were not detectable, and no histologic
abnormalities were observed in the lungs or heart with any of the
AAV serotypes tested (data not shown). It is unclear whether the
kidney damage was the primary result of pericyte transduction by
the highest dose of AAV8 or alternatively, a secondary effect of
liver fibrosis; however, it is likely the latter, because transgene
expression levels were very highin liver but lower in kidney. There
was no toxicity observed with any of the other AAVs, including
Anc80. In particular, we did not observe heart or lung inflamma-
tion or fibrosis 8 weeks after injection of Anc80-CASI-Cre dosed
at 331011 GC per mouse (Supplemental Figure 5). Taken to-
gether, these results indicate that, in contrast to AAV8, Anc80
allows efficient gene transfer to kidney pericytes, mesangial cells,
and JGA without toxicity.
Anc80 Transduces Myofibroblast Progenitors
Any gene therapy approach to treat kidney fibrosis requires
transduction of myofibroblast progenitors. We, therefore, for-
mally tested whether the pericytes and perivascular fibroblasts
transduced by Anc80 are myofibroblast progenitors. We
administered Anc80-CASI-Cre in doses
ranging from 1010 to 331011 GCs per
mouse to R26-tdTomato reporter mice
and performed UUO.The lowestdoselabeled
about 5% of kidney pericytes, whereas 131011
GCs per mouse labeled 45% (Figure 3, A
and B). In the UUO kidney, 15% of tdTo-
mato-positive interstitial cells were
aSMA-positive myofibroblasts at the low
dose of AAV-Cre, and 60% were aSMA-
positive myofibroblasts at the medium to
midhigh dose. Injection of AAV-Cre at the
low dose labeled isolated pericyte clones
with tdTomato, and after UUO, these
clones had expanded. We quantitated
clonal expansion, measured an overall
4.7-fold increase in tdTomato-positive in-
terstitial cells after UUO, and observed a
right shift in the clone size distribution
after UUO (Figure 3C). These results
confirm that Anc80 transduces kidney
myofibroblast progenitors that undergo
proliferative expansion during fibrotic
injury.
Pericyte-Specific Knockout of Gli2 by
AAV-Cre Ameliorates Kidney Fibrosis
We have previously shown that Gli2 is re-
quired for myofibroblast proliferation dur-
ing kidney fibrosis.34 We next aimed to
evaluate the feasibility of gene editing us-
ing AAV-Cre. We generated R26tdTomato
reporter mice that were either Gli2flox/flox
homozygotes or Gli2flox/wt heterozygotes
and injected 331011 GCs per mouse of
AAV-Anc80-CASI-Cre 3 weeks before UUO surgery. On the
basis of tdTomato expression, we achieved a transduction ef-
ficiency of 60% of cortical pericytes and perivascular fibro-
blasts and observed no significant histologic abnormalities in
the contralateral, uninjured kidney (Figure 4, A and B). The
Gli2flox/flox homozygotes had substantially reduced fibrosis
compared with the Gli2flox/wt heterozygote controls by a va-
riety of measures. These included reduced trichrome-positive
collagen area and aSMA and Col1a1 expression by immuno-
fluorescence (Figure 3, A and B) and reduced protein expres-
sion of Col1a1 by immunofluorescence (Figure 4, C and D).
There were also reduced levels of total aSMA and fibronectin
by Western blot (Figure 4, E–G). Additionally, the Gli2 knock-
out kidneys had reduced levels of mRNA encoding Gli1, Gli2,
aSMA, Col3a1, Col1a1 and fibronectin (Figure 4, H–M).
Injected mice from either group did not develop histologic
abnormalities in contralateral kidneys, lung, heart, or liver
(data not shown). These results indicate that Anc80-Cre can
efficiently mediate recombination of floxed alleles other than
R26 locus in kidney stroma.

doses of Anc80-Cre were injected into R26tdTomato mice 3 weeks before unilateral

tiated into aSMA-positive myofibroblasts. (C) Quantitation of myofibroblast transduction

 Pericyte-Specific Gene Targeting of b-Catenin by AAV-
Cre Ameliorates Kidney Fibrosis after UUO
Several lines of evidence have implicated canonical Wnt–
b-catenin signaling in myofibroblast proliferation and differ-
entiation during kidney fibrogenesis. This has never been
tested directly, however, due to a lack of
appropriate mouse models. We took
advantage of Anc80-Cre tropism to test
the hypothesis that canonical b-catenin
signaling is necessary for renal fibrogene-
sis. We injected Anc80-Cre into b-cateninf/f
versus b-cateninf/wt mice and subsequently
induced fibrosis by UUO. Once again, 331011
GCs per mouse was injected 3 weeks before
UUO surgery. After 10 days, mice with b-cat-
enin ablation by Anc80-Cre had an even
greater reduction in fibrosis than we observed
with Gli2 knockout (Figure 5, A and B). We
could detect substantially reduced levels of in-
terstitial and total b-catenin protein as well as
aSMA and fibronectin (Figure 5, C–E). Im-
portantly, we also saw substantial reductions
in a variety of fibrosis readouts as assessed by
realtimePCR(Figure5,F–M).Theseincluded
reductions in b-catenin targets Axin2 and
Lef1, indicating successful ablation of canon-
ical b-catenin signaling.
Analogous Tropism of Anc80 in
Human Mesenchymal Cells
Mice may not predict the biology of AAV
vectors in primates, and therefore, we next
evaluated whether Anc80 is capable of
transducing human mesenchymal cells.
We first cultured adult human kidney fi-
broblasts and transduced them with
Anc80.CASI.GFP. We observed GFP ex-
pression in PDGFRb+ mesenchymal cells,
suggesting a similar tropism of this virus
in human as in mouse (Figure 6A). Be-
cause primary cells may lose differentia-
tion marker expression in culture, we also
asked whether Anc80-GFP could trans-
duce the mesenchymal lineage in human
kidney organoids generated from induced
pluripotent stem cells. We observed that
Anc80.CASI.GFP drove GFP expression
exclusively in the interstitium of kidney
organoids and that 26% of stromal marker
Meis1-positive cells35 and 10% of
PDGFRb-positive cells were GFP positive
(Figure 6, B–D). Although we cannot be
certain of the identity of interstitial GFP-
positive cells that are negative for MEIS1
and PDGFRb, we speculate that these are
mesenchymal lineage progenitors that have not yet fully differ-
entiated, hence their lack of terminal differentiation markers,
including MEIS1 and PDGFRb. Collectively, these observa-
tions suggest that Anc80 AAV is capable of transducing the
human kidney mesenchymal cell lineage.

331011 genome copies per mouse of Anc80-Cre were injected into heterozygous or

 DISCUSSION
We report three major findings. We have
identified the first AAV serotype, namely
Anc80, that efficiently transduces adult
kidney mesenchymal cells and myofibro-
blast progenitors. We also show that
Anc80-Cre mediates high-efficiency re-
combination of two separate floxed alleles,
Gli2 and b-catenin, confirming important
roles for these signaling pathways in medi-
ating renal fibrosis and validating this ap-
proach in mice. Finally, we show that
Anc80 also can also deliver genetic material
to human mesenchymal cells in culture and
in human kidney organoids, providing a
proof of principle for the use of AAV-based
vectors in gene therapy approaches to treat
kidney fibrosis. The mechanistic basis for
the enhanced transduction properties of
the mesenchymal lineage in adult murine
kidney is the subject of future studies, but it
may relate to the rapid kinetics of expression
after Anc80 infection that may enable trans-
duction of less permissive cell targets.30,32
Our findings have applications for pre-
clinical fibrosis models, because a major
limitation of current investigations
of stromal biology is the lack of high-
efficiency Cre driver lines for the efficient
manipulation of gene expression in adult
kidney. Although FoxD1-Cre mediates
recombinationin nearly allkidneystroma,
it is only active during nephrogenesis,
and the FoxD1-CreERt2 driver is not ex-
pressed in adult kidney.36 We have used the
Gli1-CreERt2 driver with success,34,37,38 but
kidney expression is limited to outer
medullary stroma in healthy adult kid-
ney, with very limited expression in cor-
tex. Thus, an important application of
our findings is as a novel method for ef-
ficient, inducible gene knockout in adult
kidney mesenchymal cells throughout
cortex and medulla. Our approach car-
ries the added benefit of not requiring
breeding of a Cre driver allele onto the
background of a floxed allele for a partic-
ular gene of interest.
These results confirm and extend
important roles for Gli2 and canonical
Wnt–b-catenin signaling in kidney fibrogen-
esis. We had already shown a role for Gli2 in
myofibroblast differentiation, and here, we
used this knowledge as a positive control to
Figure 5. Deletion of b-catenin in kidney stroma by Anc80-Cre is antifibrotic. (A)
Heterozygous or homozygous b-catenin–flox mice were injected with 331011
genome copies (GCs) per mouse of Anc80-Cre. Three weeks later, unilateral
ureteral obstruction (UUO) was performed. Trichrome staining of UUO day 10
kidneys shows a strong reduction in interstitial collagen deposition in the
b-catenin knockout mice. (B) Reduced myofibroblast differentiation in homozy-

 assess whether Anc80-Cre can delete genes in loci other than the
R26 locus. Previously, tubular-specific b-catenin ablation was
shown to have no antifibrotic effects on injured kidney,39 and
recently, it was reported that tubule-derived Wnts are required
for fibroblast activation and kidney fibrogenesis.40 However,
whether interstitial stroma are the targets of tubule-derived
Wnts has not been formally tested because of the lack of an
inducible CreERt2 line with expression specific to kidney stroma.
Our results, therefore, confirm that interstitial pericytes and fi-
broblasts do respond to Wnt ligands and that canonical
b-catenin signaling is required for myofibroblast differentiation
during fibrosis. This result is consistent with our prior demon-
stration that genetic stabilization of b-catenin in pericytes is
sufficient to drive myofibroblast differentiation.41
Translation of these findings as a therapeutic approach to
treat CKD could take several forms. AAV could be used, for
example, to deliver siRNA targeting either Gli2 or b-catenin.
Alternatively, it could deliver genes encoding inhibitors of
these pathways, such as hedgehog-interacting protein or the
secreted Wnt inhibitor Wnt inhibitory factor 1.42,43 Several
hurdles, however, will need to be overcome to bring such a
strategy into the clinic. Anc80 exhibits high-efficiency trans-
duction of liver, muscle, retina, and other issues, leading to po-
tential extrarenal toxicities from expression of hedgehog or Wnt
pathway inhibitors. One potential solution is continued engineer-
ing of AAV tropism to achieve kidney specificity, and recent find-
ings show the feasibility of such efforts.31 Alternatively, use of a
kidney mesenchymal cell–specific promoter would limit
extrarenal expression. Finally, although AAV
supports
gene
expression
for
many
months, the slowly progressive nature of
CKD may present a need for repeated
injections, raising the possibility of immuno-
genicity. Most mammals acquire humoral
immunity against AAV capsids early in life,
and as a consequence, they mount an im-
mune response against conventional
AAVs.8,44–47 Anc80 evokes a weaker im-
mune response, because it is a synthetic virus,
but repeated injections could lead to acquired
immunity.8,30
In summary, this study evaluated five
different conventional AAVs and a syn-
thetic AAV for gene therapy applications
in kidney myofibroblast progenitors. We
identify Anc80 as a promising candidate
for gene therapy applications targeting the
kidney mesenchymal cell lineage.
