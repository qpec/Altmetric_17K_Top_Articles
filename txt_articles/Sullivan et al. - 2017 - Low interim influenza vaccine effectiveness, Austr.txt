In 2017, influenza seasonal activity was high in the 
southern hemisphere. We present interim influenza 
vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates from Australia. 
Adjusted VE was low overall at 33% (95% confidence 
interval (CI): 17 to 46), 50% (95% CI: 8 to 74) for A(H1)
pdm09, 10% (95% CI: -16 to 31) for A(H3) and 57% (95% 
CI: 41 to 69) for influenza B. For A(H3), VE was poorer 
for those vaccinated in the current and prior seasons.
The ongoing Australian 2017 influenza season was so 
far characterised by record-high laboratory-confirmed 
influenza notifications [1], high consultation rates, 
high hospitalisation and mortality rates, particularly 
in New South Wales [2], large numbers of institutional 
outbreaks [2] and media attention. The southern hemi-
sphere influenza vaccine used in Australia for this 
season was a quadrivalent formulation comprised 
of an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, 
an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus, a B/
Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (of the B/Victoria/2/87 
lineage) and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (of the 
B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage) [3,4]. This same vaccine 
composition is being used in the upcoming northern 
hemisphere for the 2017/18 influenza season [5]. Here 
we report interim influenza vaccine effectiveness esti-
mates for 2017 in Australia, using sentinel surveillance 
data.
Data collection
The Australian Sentinel Practices Research Network 
(ASPREN) and the Victorian Sentinel Practice Influenza 
Network (VicSPIN) constitute Australia’s two senti-
nel influenza general practice (GP) networks. VicSPIN 
operates in the state of Victoria, while ASPREN oper-
ates nationally. Both surveillance systems use similar 
data collection methods [6,7], with the key difference 
that the VicSPIN surveillance period is limited to 
weeks 18 to 43 (1 May 1– 29 October), timed to start 
roughly 2 weeks after vaccination campaigns in mid-
April. Briefly, sentinel GPs submit weekly reports of 
the number of patients seen with influenza-like ill-
ness (ILI), defined as fever/history of fever, cough 
and fatigue, and the total number of patients. Nose/
throat swabs are collected from a subset of patients 
with demographic data, date of ILI onset, vaccination 
status (self-reported or medical record) and indica-
tions for vaccination, such as belonging to an influenza 
risk group. Swabs are tested by RT-PCR and positive 
samples are referred to the World Health Organization 
(WHO) Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research 
on Influenza in Melbourne, for antigenic characterisa-
tion by haemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) [8] or 
focus reduction assay (FRA) [9] and genetic sequenc-
ing, as described previously [6]. All data were managed 
and analysed using R version 3.4.1.
Influenza-like illness activity
ILI data from ASPREN for 2017 and 2012 to 2016 (aver-
aged) are plotted in Figure 1A and indicate consultation 
rates were higher in 2017 than in the previous 5 years. 
For the study period from 1 May 2017 to 24 September 
2017, i.e. weeks 18–38, the 262 ASPREN GPs and 88 
VicSPIN GPs conducted 493,961 consultations, of which 
5,678 (1.1%) met the ILI case definition and swabs were 
collected from 2,465 (43%) of them. Influenza cases 
were detected in every week of the study period and 
peaked in week 34 (21–27 August, n = 235). Percentage 
of positive samples peaked in week 32 (7–13 August) 
with 58%.

Virological characteristics
Virological analyses and vaccine effectiveness esti-
mation were restricted to the period 1 May to 24 
September (weeks 18-38). During this period, 2,456 
patients were swabbed, but samples from 116 patients 
were excluded because of missing information on vac-
cination status, and one with missing influenza sta-
tus. Among the remaining 2,339 patients, working-age 
adults comprised the majority (n = 1,604, 69%), 440 
(19%) were aged < 15 years and 297 (13%) were aged ≥ 65 
years. Around 37% (477/1,279) of test-negative patients 
were vaccinated in 2017.
Eighty-eight patients tested positive for A(H1)pdm09, 
522 were A(H3), 75 were not yet subtyped, 11 were B/
Victoria, 259 were B/Yamagata and 105 were influenza

The phylogenetic tree was created using GENEiOUS, (Biomatters Limited.), Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood (RAxML) Version 8, and Phylogenetic Analysis 
by Maximum Likelihood (PAML). Blue colouring indicates the virus came from a vaccinated patient. Red colouring indicates vaccine reference viruses. Not all viruses 
analysed are shown. There were 128 (62%) 3C.2a viruses, among which there were several variants when compared with the vaccine strain, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, 
all but three of which included the gain of a potential glycosylation site at position 160 (K160T(+)), which distinguishes these viruses from the vaccine strain. Additional 
substitutions included 59 viruses characterised by substitutions at N31S,D53N,R142G,S144R,N171K,I192T, 45 by N121K,S144K, and 15 by T131K,R142K,R261Q. Seventy-
eight (38%) viruses were 3C.2a1 viruses, among which 13 were characterised by substitutions at N121K,G479E,T135K(-) (loss of a potential glycosylation site at position 
135) and 61 by K92R,N121K,H311Q including 34 that also had T135K(-).

B, but the lineage was not yet determined (Figure 1B). 
Virus isolation was attempted for samples with a cycle 
threshold value of 30 or less (Table 1). HAI testing indi-
cated that isolates were generally antigenically similar 
to their respective vaccine strains. Thirty-seven per-
cent (n=98) of A(H3) viruses yielded insufficient hae-
magglutinin titres for testing by HAI and were instead 
assessed by FRA. In HAI and FRA, 10% (7/67) and 0% 
(0/75) of A(H3) viruses, respectively, were low reacting 
to post-infection ferret antisera raised to cell-propa-
gated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014-like viruses. However, 
these proportions increased to 33% (22/67) and 20% 
(15/75), respectively, when tested against egg-propa-
gated reference virus.
Sequences for the haemagglutinin gene were available 
for a subset of A(H3) viruses (Figure 2). Examination of 
the phylogenetic tree identified considerable diversity 
with a number of viruses exhibiting amino acid substi-
tutions in key glycosylation and antigenic sites but no 
specific clustering of vaccine failures. GISAID acces-
sion numbers for these viruses were 271246, 271303, 
275219, 275220, 275225, 275226, 275227, 275228, 
275246, 275247, 275248, 275278, 275280, 277305, 
277315, 277557.
Vaccines effectiveness estimates 
Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated following a 
case–control test-negative design, where VE is esti-
mated from the odds ratio (OR) comparing the odds 
of vaccination among test-positive and test-negative 
patients. The limitations of this design have been 
discussed at length [10,11]. Estimates were adjusted 
for week of specimen collection (cubic spline with 4 
knots), and age group (spline with knots at 5, 15, 35, 
65, 75 years).
VE estimates are shown in Table 2. Overall VE was 33% 
(95%CI: 17 to 46). This estimate appeared to be skewed 
by the very low estimate for A(H3), which was 10% 
(95%CI: -16 to 31), whereas estimates were higher for 
A(H1)pdm09 (VE: 50%; 95%CI: 8 to 74) and B (VE: 57%; 
95%CI: 41 to 69). VE for A(H3) 3C.2a viruses was 5% 
(95%CI: -51 to 40), while the estimate for 3C.2a1 was 
19% (95%CI: -42 to 55). For patients vaccinated in the 
2016 season, VE for A(H3) was 3–4% regardless of 
whether they were also vaccinated in 2017. In contrast, 
the highest VE point estimates for influenza B were 
observed among those vaccinated in both 2016 and 
2017.
Discussion
Our interim analysis suggests moderate VE against 
influenza A(H1)pdm09 and influenza B. However, VE 
was low against influenza A(H3). The antigenic data 
reflect ongoing issues with A(H3) candidate vac-
cine viruses which, when propagated in eggs, rapidly 
acquire adaptive changes in the haemagglutinin which 
alter antigenicity. Cell-based vaccines, which are less 
affected by this, are only licensed in the United States, 
were not available in Australia in 2017 and will also 
not be available for the upcoming European season.

a Virus isolation was not attempted for all viruses and not all isolates were analysed by HAI or FRA; FRA was only attempted for A(H3) viruses.
b Results for post-infection ferret antisera raised to egg-propagated and cell-propagated reference viruses are presented because the egg-
propagated reference viruses more closely resemble the vaccine strain, while cell-propagated reference viruses more closely resemble the 
original virus from which the vaccine strain was derived.

CI: confidence interval; NA: not applicable; NE: not estimated (because cell counts are fewer than five); Ref: reference category VE: vaccine 
effectiveness; y: years.
Numbers are shown for all groups regardless of whether VE estimation was attempted. VE was only estimated where cell counts were at least 
five. Although presented, estimates for children and those aged ≥65 years typically have wide CIs and should be interpreted with caution. 
Note that the same control group is used for all comparisons within an age group.
a All estimates adjusted for calendar time (cubic spline function with 4 knots). Estimates for all ages were also adjusted for age (cubic spline 
with knots at 5, 15, 35, 65, 75).

The significant genetic diversity of circulating viruses, 
many of which exhibit amino acid substitutions in key 
antigenic and glycosylation sites, also makes it difficult 
to select candidate vaccine viruses with high coverage.
This was the second season for which the A/Hong 
Kong/4801/2015-containing vaccine was used in 
Australia [3,12], and campaigns currently underway in 
the northern hemisphere are also using it for a second 
time [5,13]. During the 2016/17 northern hemisphere 
season interim VE estimates ranged from 15% (95%CI: 
–11 to 35) to 43% (95%CI: 29 to 54) [14-17]. It is unclear 
whether sequential vaccination will result in lower 
estimates for 2017/18, but our VE estimates were par-
ticularly low for people who received vaccine in 2016 
and for older adults, 76% of whom were sequentially 
vaccinated. This finding is consistent with a modelling 
study which predicts low VE for sequentially vaccinated 
persons when the vaccine composition is identical, but 
the antigenic distance between the vaccine and circu-
lating strains is high [18]. However, confounding due to 
prior infection status and negative interference from 
pre-2016 vaccines could not be controlled for in our 
analysis, and may have introduced bias.
In contrast to A(H3), VE estimates for influenza B were 
moderate and the combined effects of vaccination in 
2016 and 2017 did not blunt effectiveness for influenza 
B, even though the composition remained the same. 
Similarly, VE for the few A(H1)pdm09 cases recruited 
was moderate, although low for Australia at 50% 
(95%CI: 8 to 74), where VEs have ranged from 54% to 
79% in the past [6,7]. This was the one component of 
the 2017 vaccine that was updated since 2016, from A/
California/7/2009 to A/Michigan/45/2015.
This study provides interim estimates of the 2017 south-
ern hemisphere influenza vaccine in the outpatient set-
ting and may not apply to inpatient settings or severe 
illness. Interim estimates can reliably predict final sea-
son estimates [19], particularly when made after the 
peak [20], as is the case here. Should the circulating 
A(H3) influenza viruses predominate in the 2017/18 
northern hemisphere influenza season [21], our results 
suggest that the vaccine may confer limited protection. 
Health authorities should consider other influenza pre-
vention measures, including antivirals and health pro-
motion messaging, in the event of a severe season and 
low VE against A(H3).
