Abstract: Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new
cancer cases and deaths that will occur in the United States and compiles the most
recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival. Incidence data, available
through 2014, were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Pro-
gram; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association
of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data, available through 2015, were collected
by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2018, 1,735,350 new cancer cases
and 609,640 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Over the
past decade of data, the cancer incidence rate (2005-2014) was stable in women
and declined by approximately 2% annually in men, while the cancer death rate
(2006-2015) declined by about 1.5% annually in both men and women. The combined
cancer death rate dropped continuously from 1991 to 2015 by a total of 26%, trans-
lating to approximately 2,378,600 fewer cancer deaths than would have been
expected if death rates had remained at their peak. Of the 10 leading causes of
death, only cancer declined from 2014 to 2015. In 2015, the cancer death rate was
14% higher in non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) than non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) overall
(death rate ratio [DRR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.13-1.15), but the
racial disparity was much larger for individuals aged <65 years (DRR, 1.31; 95% CI,
1.29-1.32) compared with those aged �65 years (DRR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.06-1.09) and
varied substantially by state. For example, the cancer death rate was lower in NHBs
than NHWs in Massachusetts for all ages and in New York for individuals aged �65
years, whereas for those aged <65 years, it was 3 times higher in NHBs in the
District of Columbia (DRR, 2.89; 95% CI, 2.16-3.91) and about 50% higher in
Wisconsin (DRR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.56-2.02), Kansas (DRR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.25-1.81),
Louisiana (DRR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.38-1.60), Illinois (DRR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.39-1.57), and
California (DRR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.38-1.54). Larger racial inequalities in young and
middle-aged adults probably partly reflect less access to high-quality health care. CA

Introduction
Cancer is a major public health problem worldwide and is the second leading cause
of death in the United States. In this article, we provide the estimated numbers of
new cancer cases and deaths in 2018 in the United States nationally and for each
state, as well as a comprehensive overview of cancer occurrence based on the most
current population-based data for cancer incidence through 2014 and for mortality
through 2015. We also estimate the total number of deaths averted as a result of
the continual decline in cancer death rates since the early 1990s and quantify the
black-white disparity in cancer mortality by state and age based on the actual num-
ber of reported cancer deaths in 2015.
Materials and Methods
Incidence and Mortality Data
Mortality data from 1930 to 2015 were provided by the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS).1-3 Forty-seven states and the District of Columbia (DC) met
data quality requirements for reporting to the national vital statistics system in
1930. Texas, Alaska, and Hawaii began reporting mortality data in 1933, 1959, and

*Rounded to the nearest 10; cases exclude basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers and in situ carcinoma except urinary bladder.
About 63,960 cases of carcinoma in situ of the female breast and 87,290 cases of melanoma in situ will be newly diagnosed in 2018.
†Deaths for colon and rectum cancers are combined because a large number of deaths from rectal cancer are misclassified as colon.
‡More deaths than cases may reflect a lack of specificity in recording the underlying cause of death on death certificates and/or an undercount in the case estimate.
Note: These are model-based estimates that should be interpreted with caution and not compared to those for previous years.

 1960, respectively. The methods for abstraction and age
adjustment of mortality data are described elsewhere.3,4
Population-based cancer incidence data in the United States
have been collected by the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI’s)
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Pro-
gram since 1973 and by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention’s (CDC’s) National Program of Cancer Registries
(NPCR) since 1995. The SEER program is the only source for
historic population-based incidence data. Long-term incidence
and survival trends (1975-2014) were based on data from the 9
oldest SEER areas (Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico,
Utah, and the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Detroit, San
Francisco-Oakland, and Seattle-Puget Sound), representing
approximately 9% of the US population.5 The lifetime proba-
bility of developing cancer and contemporary stage distribution
and survival statistics were based on data from all 18 SEER
registries (the SEER 9 registries plus Alaska Natives, Califor-
nia, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, and New Jersey), covering
28% of the US population.6 The probability of developing can-
cer was calculated using NCI’s DevCan software (version
6.7.5).7 Some of the statistical information presented herein
was adapted from data previously published in the SEER Can-
cer Statistics Review 1975-2014.8
The North American Association of Central Cancer
Registries (NAACCR) compiles and reports incidence data
from 1995 onward for registries that participate in the
SEER program and/or the NPCR. These data approach
100% coverage of the US population in the most recent
time period and were the source for the projected new
cancer cases in 2018 and cross-sectional incidence rates by
state and race/ethnicity.9,10 Some of the incidence data pre-
sented herein were previously published in volumes 1 and 2
of Cancer in North America: 2010-2014.11,12
All cancer cases were classified according to the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases for Oncology except childhood
and adolescent cancers, which were classified according to
the
International
Classification
of
Childhood
Cancer
(ICCC).13,14 Causes of death were classified according to
the International Classification of Diseases.15 All incidence
and death rates were age-standardized to the 2000 US stan-
dard population and expressed per 100,000 population, as
calculated by NCI’s SEER*Stat software (version 8.3.4).16
The annual percent change in rates was quantified using
NCI’s Joinpoint Regression Program (version 4.5.0.1).17
Whenever possible, cancer incidence rates presented in
this report were adjusted for delays in reporting, which
occur because of a lag in case capture or data corrections.
Delay adjustment has the largest effect on the most recent
years of data for cancers that are frequently diagnosed in
outpatient settings (eg, melanoma, leukemia, and prostate
cancer) and provides a more accurate portrayal of the cancer
burden in the most recent time period.18 For example, the
leukemia incidence rate for 2014 is 13% higher after adjust-
ing for reporting delays.19
Projected Cancer Cases and Deaths in 2018
The most recent year for which reported incidence and mor-
tality data are available lags 2 to 4 years behind the current

 year due to the time required for data collection, compila-
tion, quality control, and dissemination. Therefore, we pro-
jected the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the
United States in 2018 to provide an estimate of the contem-
porary cancer burden.
To calculate the number of invasive cancer cases, a gener-
alized linear mixed model was used to estimate complete
counts for each county (or health service area for rare can-
cers) from 2000 through 2014 using high-quality incidence
data from 48 states and DC (approximately 96% population
coverage) and geographic variations in sociodemographic
and lifestyle factors, medical settings, and cancer screening
behaviors.20 Data were unavailable for all years for Kansas
and Minnesota and for some years for other states. Modeled
counts were adjusted for delays in cancer reporting using
registry-specific or combined delay ratios and aggregated to
obtain national- and state-level counts for each year. Finally,
a time series projection method (vector autoregression) was
applied to all 15 years of modeled data to estimate counts
for 2018. This method cannot estimate numbers of basal
cell or squamous cell skin cancers because data on the occur-
rence of these cancers are generally not reported to cancer
registries. For complete details of the case projection meth-
odology, please refer to Zhu et al.21
In situ cases of female breast carcinoma and melanoma of
the skin diagnosed in 2018 were estimated by first approxi-
mating the number of cases occurring annually from 2005
through 2014 based on age-specific NAACCR incidence
rates (data from 46 states and DC with high-quality data
every year) and US population estimates provided in SEER*-
Stat. Counts were then adjusted for delays in reporting using
SEER delay factors for invasive breast cancer and melanoma,
respectively, because delay factors are not available for in situ
cases. Counts were then projected to 2018 based on the aver-
age annual percent change during the entire time period as
generated by the joinpoint regression model.

Estimates are rounded to the nearest 10 and cases exclude basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers and in situ carcinoma except urinary bladder. Ranking
is based on modeled projections and may differ from the most recent observed data.

 The number of cancer deaths expected to occur in 2018
was estimated based on the most recent joinpoint-generated
annual percent change in reported cancer deaths from 2001
through 2015 at the state and national levels as reported to
the NCHS. For the complete details of this methodology,
please refer to Chen et al.22
Other Statistics
The number of cancer deaths averted in men and women
due to the reduction in cancer death rates since the early
1990s was estimated by summing the difference between
the annual number of recorded cancer deaths from the num-
ber that would have been expected if cancer death rates had
remained at their peak. The expected number of deaths was
estimated by applying the 5-year age- and sex-specific can-
cer death rates in the peak year for age-standardized cancer
death rates (1990 in men and 1991 in women) to the corre-
sponding age- and sex-specific populations in subsequent
years through 2015. We also calculated the racial disparity
in overall cancer mortality by state and age (<65 years and
�65 years) in 2015 based on death rate ratios (DRRs) com-
paring non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) with non-Hispanic
whites (NHWs) using SEER*Stat.
Selected Findings
Expected Numbers of New Cancer Cases
Table 1 presents the estimated numbers of new cases of
invasive cancer expected in the United States in 2018 by sex.
The overall estimate of 1,735,350 cases is the equivalent of
more than 4,700 new cancer diagnoses each day. In addition,
about 63,960 cases of female breast carcinoma in situ and
87,290 cases of melanoma in situ of the skin are expected to
be diagnosed in 2018. The estimated numbers of new cases
by state for selected cancers are shown in Table 2.

 Figure 1 depicts the most common cancers expected to
occur in men and women in 2018. Prostate, lung and bron-
chus (referred to as lung hereafter), and colorectal cancers
account for 42% of all cases in men, with prostate cancer
alone accounting for almost 1 in 5 new diagnoses. For
women, the 3 most common cancers are breast, lung, and
colorectum, which collectively represent one-half of all
cases; breast cancer alone accounts for 30% all new cancer
diagnoses in women.
The lifetime probability of being diagnosed with invasive
cancer is slightly higher for men (39.7%) than for women
(37.6%) (Table 3). The reasons for the increased susceptibil-
ity in men are not well understood, but to some extent
reflect differences in environmental exposures, endogenous
hormones, and probably complex interactions between these
influences. Adult height, which is determined by genetics
and childhood nutrition, is positively associated with cancer
incidence and death in both men and women,23 and has
been estimated to account for one-third of the sex
disparity.24
Expected Numbers of Cancer Deaths
An estimated 609,640 Americans will die from cancer
in 2018, corresponding to almost 1,700 deaths per day
(Table 1). The most common causes of cancer death are can-
cers of the lung, prostate, and colorectum in men and the
lung, breast, and colorectum in women (Fig. 1). These 4 can-
cers account for 45% of all cancer deaths, with one-quarter
due to lung cancer. Table 4 provides the estimated numbers
of cancer deaths in 2018 by state for selected cancers.
Trends in Cancer Incidence
Figure 2 illustrates long-term trends in cancer incidence rates
for all cancers combined by sex. Cancer incidence patterns
reflect trends in behaviors associated with cancer risk and
changes in medical practice, such as the use of cancer screen-
ing tests. The volatility in incidence for males compared with
females reflects rapid changes in prostate cancer incidence,
which spiked in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Fig. 3) due to
a surge in the detection of asymptomatic disease as a result of
widespread prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing.25
Over the past decade of data, the overall cancer incidence
rate in men declined by about 2% per year, with the pace
accelerating in more recent years (Table 5). This trend
reflects large continuing declines for cancers of the lung and
colorectum, in addition to a sharp reduction in prostate can-
cer incidence of about 10% annually from 2010 to 2014.
The drop in prostate cancer incidence has been attributed to

 decreased PSA testing from 2008 to 2013 in the wake of
US Preventive Services
Task
Force recommendations
against routine use of the test to screen for prostate cancer
(Grade D) in ages 75 and older in 2008 and in all men in
2011 because of growing concerns about overdiagnosis and
overtreatment.26,27 The effect of screening reductions on
the incidence of advanced disease is being monitored
closely. One analysis of SEER data through 2012 indicated
a slight uptick in the diagnosis of distant stage prostate can-
cer among men aged 50 to 69 years,28 which may reflect the
larger downturn in PSA testing among younger men.29,30
In April 2017, the Task Force issued a draft statement revis-
ing its recommendation for men aged 55 to 69 years to
informed decision making (Grade C) based on an updated
evidence review.31,32
The overall cancer incidence rate in women has remained
generally stable over the past few decades because declines in
lung and colorectal cancers have been offset by increasing or sta-
ble rates for breast, uterine corpus, and thyroid cancers and for
melanoma (Table 5). The slight increase in breast cancer
incidence from 2005 to 2014 was driven by increases of 0.3% to
0.4% per year among Hispanic and black women and 1.7% per
year among Asian/Pacific Islander women; rates among NHWs
and American Indians/Alaska Natives remained stable.33
Lung cancer incidence rates continue to decline about twice
as fast in men as in women, reflecting historical differences in
tobacco uptake and cessation, as well as upturns in female
smoking prevalence in some birth cohorts.34,35 In contrast,
colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence patterns are generally simi-
lar in men and women (Fig. 3); from 2005 through 2014,
incidence rates declined annually by about 2% to 3%,
although the trend may have stabilized in women during the
most recent data years (Table 5). Reductions in CRC inci-
dence prior to 2000 are attributed equally to changes in risk
factors and the use of screening, which allows for the removal
of premalignant lesions.36 However, more recent rapid
declines are thought to primarily reflect increased uptake of
colonoscopy, which now is the predominant screening
test.37,38 Colonoscopy use among US adults aged 50 years
and older tripled from 21% in 2000 to 60% in 2015.39

 In contrast to the rapid declines in CRC incidence overall,
which are driven by trends in older age groups, rates in indi-
viduals aged younger than 55 years increased by almost 2%
per year from the mid-1990s to 2014.40
Liver cancer incidence continues to increase rapidly in
women, but appears to be plateauing in men since 2010
(Table 5). However, trends vary by age; from 2010 to
2014, rates increased annually by 1% to 2% in men and
women aged younger than 40 years, decreased or were
stable in men and women aged 40 to 59 years, and
increased annually by 8% in individuals aged 60 to 69
years and by 3% in those aged 70 years and older.40 There
is potential to avert much of the future burden of liver
cancer associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection
through increased HCV detection coupled with new,
well-tolerated antiviral therapies that lower the risk of
hepatocellular carcinoma.41,42 Most HCV-infected indi-
viduals are undiagnosed, and 80% are baby boomers
(those born between 1945 and 1965), for whom one-time
screening has been recommended since 2012.43,44 Several
states have even mandated that health care providers offer
HCV testing to appropriate patients.45 However, of the
FIGURE 7. Trends in Cancer Death Rates by Sex Overall and for Selected Cancers, United States, 1930 to 2015.
Rates are age adjusted to the 2000 US standard population. Due to improvements in International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding over time, numerator
data for cancers of the lung and bronchus, colon and rectum, liver, and uterus differ from the contemporary time period. For example, rates for lung and bron-
chus include pleura, trachea, mediastinum, and other respiratory organs.

 more than 76 million estimated baby boomers in 2015,
only 14% reported having received HCV testing.46 Add-
ing to the disease burden is a worrisome 2-fold increase
in HCV infections from 2010 to 2014 (following a stable
trend) driven by individuals aged 20-39 years as a conse-
quence of the opioid epidemic.
The long-term, rapid rise in melanoma incidence appears
to be slowing, particularly among younger age groups; from
2005 to 2014, rates were stable in men and women aged
younger than 50 years (except for declines of 0.7% annually
in men aged 40-49 years), while increasing more rapidly
with advancing age in those aged 50 years and older. Inci-
dence rates for thyroid cancer also may have begun to stabi-
lize in recent years, particularly among whites,8 in the wake
of changes in clinical practice guidelines that include more
conservative indications for biopsy and the reclassification of
noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like
nuclear features.47-49

 Cancer Survival
For all cancers combined, the 5-year relative survival rate is
68% in whites and 61% in blacks.8 Figure 4 shows 5-year rel-
ative survival rates by cancer type and race during the most
recent time period (2007-2013). For all stages combined, sur-
vival is highest for prostate cancer (99%), melanoma of the
skin (92%), and female breast cancer (90%) and lowest for
cancers of the pancreas (8%), lung (18%), and liver (18%).
Survival is lower for black than for white patients for every
cancer type shown in Figure 4 except cancers of the kidney
and pancreas, with an absolute difference �10% for more
than one-half of these. The largest differences are for mela-
noma (26%) and cancers of the uterine corpus (22%) and oral
cavity and pharynx (18%), in part reflecting a much later stage
at diagnosis in black patients (Fig. 5). Blacks are more likely
than whites to be diagnosed with cancer at an advanced stage,
but also have lower stage-specific survival for most cancer
types. After adjusting for sex, age, and stage at diagnosis, the
relative risk of death after a cancer diagnosis is 33% higher in
black patients than in white patients.50 The disparity is even
more striking for American Indians/Alaska Natives, who are
51% more likely than whites to die from their cancer.
Cancer survival has improved since the mid-1970s for
all of the most common cancers except those of the uter-
ine cervix and uterine corpus,50 although increased sur-
vival for some cancer types (eg, breast and prostate) is
difficult to interpret because of changes in detection
practice (eg, lead time bias). Progress has been especially
rapid for hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies due
to improvements in treatment protocols, including the
discovery of targeted therapies. For example, the 5-year
relative survival
rate for
chronic myeloid
leukemia
increased from 22% for patients diagnosed in the mid-1970s
to 68% for those diagnosed during 2007 through 2013.8
Based on a review of clinical trial data, most patients with
chronic myeloid leukemia who are treated with tyrosine

 kinase inhibitors experience near normal life expectancy, par-
ticularly those diagnosed before age 65 years.51 In general,
oncology advances have benefitted patients aged 50 to 64
years more than their older counterparts, likely reflecting
lower efficacy or use of new therapies in the elderly popula-
tion.52 Survival gains are also often stage specific; for example,
patients with liver cancer diagnosed at a localized stage had
among the largest absolute gains in survival over the past 3
decades, largely because of advances in liver transplantation,
whereas those diagnosed with distant stage disease had no
improvement.50
In contrast to the steady increase in survival observed for
most cancer types, advances have been slow for lung and
pancreatic cancers, which are typically diagnosed at a distant
stage (Fig. 5), for which the 5-year survival rates are 5% and
3%, respectively. There is potential for lung cancer to be
diagnosed at an earlier stage among high-risk individuals
through the use of screening with low-dose computed
tomography (LDCT), which has been shown to reduce
lung cancer mortality by up to 20% among current and
former smokers with a smoking history of 30 or more pack-
years.53,54 However, in 2015, only 4% of the 6.8 million

Trends in Cancer Mortality
Mortality trends are the best indicator of progress against
cancer because they are less affected by detection practices
than incidence and survival.56 The overall cancer death rate
rose during most of the 20th century, largely driven by rapid
increases in lung cancer deaths among men as a consequence
of the tobacco epidemic, but has declined by about 1.5% per
year since the early 1990s. From its peak of 215.1 (per
100,000 population) in 1991, the cancer death rate dropped
26% to 158.6 in 2015. This decline, which is larger in men
(32% since 1990) than in women (23% since 1991), trans-
lates to approximately 2,378,600 fewer cancer deaths
(1,639,100 in men and 739,500 in women) than what would
have occurred if peak rates had persisted (Fig. 6).
The decline in cancer mortality over the past 2 decades is
primarily the result of steady reductions in smoking and
advances in early detection and treatment, reflected in consid-
erable decreases for the 4 major cancers (lung, breast, prostate,
and colorectum) (Fig. 7). Specifically, the death rate dropped

 39% from 1989 to 2015 for female breast cancer, 52% from
1993 to 2015 for prostate cancer, and 52% from 1970 to 2015
for CRC. Lung cancer death rates declined 45% from 1990
to 2015 among males and 19% from 2002 to 2015 among
females due to reduced tobacco use because of increased
awareness of the health hazards of smoking and the imple-
mentation of comprehensive tobacco control.57 The rapid
declines in prostate cancer mortality, attributed to earlier
detection due to PSA testing and advances in treatment,58
appear to be plateauing in recent years in men aged younger
than 70 years.1 Similarly, CRC death rates increased slightly
in individuals aged younger than 55 years since the mid-
2000s,59 despite rapid declines in older age groups.
In contrast to the overall declining trends for the 4 major
cancers, death rates rose during 2011 through 2015 for liver
cancer by 2.7% per year in women and by 1.6% per year in
men, as well as for uterine corpus cancer by about 2% per
year and for pancreatic cancer in men by 0.3% per year
(Table 6). Death rates also increased slightly for cancers of
the brain and other nervous system in both sexes and the
oral cavity and pharynx in men.1
Recorded Number of Deaths in 2015
A total of 2,712,630 deaths were recorded in the United
States in 2015, 22% of which were from cancer (Table 7). Of
the 10 leading causes of death, cancer was the only one for
which the age-standardized death rate declined from 2014 to
2015 (by 1.7%).60 Cancer is the second leading cause of death
after heart disease in both men and women nationally, but is
the leading cause of death in many states61 and in Hispanic
and Asian Americans.62,63 Cancer is the first or second lead-
ing cause of death for every age group shown in Table
8 among females, whereas accidents, assault, and suicide pre-
dominate among males aged younger than 40 years.
Table 9 presents the number of deaths in 2015 for the 5
leading cancer types by age and sex. Among men, the lead-
ing cause of cancer death is brain and other nervous system
tumors before age 40 years and lung cancer in those of older
ages. Among women, the leading cause of cancer death is
brain and other nervous system tumors before age 20 years,
breast cancer from ages 20 to 59 years, and lung cancer
thereafter. Notably, cervical cancer is the second leading
cause of cancer death in women aged 20 to 39 years, under-
scoring the need for increased screening in young women,
as well higher uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV)
vaccination. In 2016, only one-half (49.5%) of females aged
13 to 17 years were up to date with HPV vaccination.64
Cancer Disparities by Race/Ethnicity
Cancer occurrence and outcomes vary considerably between
racial and ethnic groups, largely because of inequalities in
wealth that lead to differences in risk factor exposures and
barriers to high-quality cancer prevention, early detection,
and treatment.65,66 Cancer incidence and mortality are gen-
erally highest among NHBs and lowest among Asian/
Pacific Islanders (Table 10). The overall cancer incidence
rate in NHB men is 85% higher than that in Asian/Pacific
Islander men and 10% higher than that in NHW men,
although rates are higher in NHWs compared with NHBs
for men aged younger than 45 years and older than 80 years.
Notably, NHB women have 7% lower cancer incidence than
NHW women because of lower rates of breast and lung
cancer, but 14% higher overall cancer mortality.
In men and women combined, the cancer death rate in
2015 was 14% higher in NHBs than in NHWs (death rate
ratio [DRR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.13-
1.15), down from a peak of 33% in 1993. However, the racial
gap was substantially larger for individuals aged younger than
65 years (DRR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.29-1.32) than for those aged
65 years or older (DRR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.06-1.09), probably
in part due to universal health care access for seniors through
Medicare. Racial inequalities have also been shown to vary
substantially across states.33 Among the 40 states (including
DC) for which there was a sufficient number (�50) of cancer
deaths in NHBs for stable estimates, the DRR in blacks

 versus whites ranged from 1.89 (95% CI, 1.62-2.21) in DC to
0.89 (95% CI, 0.81-0.97) in Massachusetts (Table 11). Death
rates were not statistically significantly different in 13 states,
albeit some of which had few deaths. Importantly, a lack of
racial disparity is not always indicative of progress. For exam-
ple, Kentucky and West Virginia, for which death rates were
not statistically different by race, have the highest cancer
death rates in NHWs of all states while DC, with the largest
disparity, has the lowest rate. Among individuals aged 65
years and older, death rates were lower in NHBs than in
NHWs in New York (871.3 per 100,000 population vs 909.6)
as well as Massachusetts (754.0 per 100,000 population vs
925.3), and were not statistically significantly different in one-
half (19 of 37) of states. Notably, among those aged younger
than 65 years, the disparity was �45% in DC (DRR, 2.89;
95% CI, 2.16-3.91), Wisconsin (DRR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.56-
2.02), Kansas (DRR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.25-1.81), Louisiana
(DRR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.38-1.60), Illinois (DRR, 1.48; 95%
CI, 1.39-1.57), and California (DRR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.38-
1.54); of these 6 states, all but Kansas also had statistically sig-
nificantly higher rates in blacks aged 65 years and older.
Some of the variation in racial disparities by state may
reflect the growing number of black immigrants, who are
healthier and older than their native-born counterparts, and
now account for 9% of the US black population. The number
of foreign-born blacks more than doubled over the past 2 dec-
ades, from 1.4 million in 1990 to 3.8 million in 2013, and is
highly concentrated in the Northeast and the South.67 The
proportion of the black population that was foreign born in
2011-2015 was �28% in 10 states, including New York
(28%) and Massachusetts (34%) (Table 11). Immigrant popu-
lations have lower disease rates than those born in the United
States, partly because of more favorable characteristics such as
lower smoking and obesity prevalence.68-70 One study found
that foreign-born blacks in the United States have cancer
mortality rates that are about 10% lower than those of native
NHWs and 40% lower than those of native blacks.68 Com-
prehensive health care reform in Massachusetts, which began
rolling out in 2006 and has achieved near-universal insurance
coverage, has been associated with mortality reductions71 and
may have also contributed to the state’s success in eliminating
racial disparities.
Geographic Variation in Cancer Occurrence
Tables 12 and 13 show cancer incidence and mortality rates
for selected cancers by state. State variation in cancer inci-
dence results from differences in medical detection practice
and the prevalence of risk factors, such as smoking, obesity,
and other health behaviors. For example, the large geo-
graphic variation in HPV vaccination coverage, which
ranged from 29% in Mississippi and South Carolina to 71%
in Rhode Island in 2016,64 may contribute to future
differential patterns in HPV-associated cancers.72,73 Geo-
graphic disparities, which have increased over time,74,75
often reflect the national distribution of poverty. This trend
may be exacerbated by widening inequalities in access to
health care because of state differences in Medicaid expan-
sion and other initiatives to improve insurance coverage.76,77
The largest geographic variation in cancer occurrence by
far is for lung cancer, reflecting the large historical and con-
tinuing differences in smoking prevalence between states.57
For example, lung cancer incidence rates in Kentucky (116
per 100,000 population in men and 80 per 100,000 popula-
tion in women), where smoking prevalence continues to be
highest, are about 3.5 times higher than those in Utah (33 per
100,000 population in men and 24 per 100,000 population in
women), where smoking prevalence is lowest. In 2015, more
than one-quarter (26%) of residents in Kentucky and West
Virginia were current smokers compared with 9% in Utah.78
Smoking history similarly predicts state disparities in
smoking-attributable mortality; the proportion of total cancer
deaths caused by smoking in 2014 was 38% in men and 29%
in women in Kentucky, compared with 22% and 11%, respec-
tively, in Utah.
Cancer in Children and Adolescents
Cancer is the second most common cause of death among chil-
dren aged 1 to 14 years in the United States, surpassed only by
accidents. In 2018, an estimated 10,590 children (birth to 14
years) will be diagnosed with cancer (excluding benign/border-
line malignant brain tumors) and 1,180 will die from the dis-
ease. Benign and borderline malignant brain tumors are not
included in the 2018 case estimates because the calculation
method requires historical data and these tumors were not
required to be reported to cancer registries until 2004.
Leukemia accounts for 29% of all childhood cancers (includ-
ing benign and borderline malignant brain tumors), three-
quarters of which are lymphoid. Brain and other nervous system
tumors are second most common (26%), of which approximately
one-quarter are benign/borderline malignant. The third most
common category is lymphomas and reticuloendothelial
neoplasms (12%), almost one-half of which are non-
Hodgkin lymphoma (including Burkitt lymphoma) and
one-quarter of which are Hodgkin lymphoma. Soft tissue
sarcomas (almost one-half of which are rhabdomyosar-
coma) and neuroblastoma each account for 6% of child-
hood cancers, followed by renal (Wilms) tumors (5%).9
Cancers in adolescents (aged 15 to 19 years) differ some-
what from those in children in terms of type and distribution.
For example, brain and other nervous system tumors (21%)
(more than one-half [58%] of which are benign/borderline
malignant) and lymphoma (20%) are equally common, and
there are almost twice as many cases of Hodgkin lymphoma
as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Leukemia is third (13%),
CA CANCER J CLIN 2018;68:7–30

27
 followed by germ cell and gonadal tumors (11%) and thyroid
carcinoma (11%). Melanoma of the skin accounts for 4% of
the cancers diagnosed in adolescents.
Although overall cancer incidence in children and adoles-
cents has been increasing slightly (by 0.6% per year) since
1975, rates appear to have stabilized over the past 5 data years.
In contrast, death rates in individuals aged birth to 19 years
have declined continuously, from 6.5 (per 100,000 population)
in 1970 to 2.3 in 2015, an overall reduction of 65% (67% in
children and 61% in adolescents). The 5-year relative survival
rate for all cancers combined improved from 58% during the
mid-1970s to 83% during 2007 through 2013 for children and
from 68% to 84% for adolescents. However, survival varies
substantially by cancer type and age at diagnosis (Table 14).
Limitations
Although the estimated numbers of new cancer cases and
deaths expected to occur in 2018 provide a reasonably accurate
portrayal of the contemporary cancer burden, they are model-
based, 3-year- or 4-year-ahead projections that should be inter-
preted with caution and not be used to track trends over time.
First, the estimates may be affected by changes in methodology
as we take advantage of improvements in modeling techniques
and cancer surveillance coverage. Second, although the models
are robust, they can only account for trends through the most
recent data year (currently 2014 for incidence and 2015 for
mortality) and cannot anticipate abrupt fluctuations for cancers
affected by changes in detection practice (eg, PSA testing and
prostate cancer). Third, the model can be oversensitive to sud-
den or large changes in observed data. The most informative
metrics for tracking cancer trends are age-standardized or age-
specific cancer death rates from the NCHS and cancer inci-
dence rates from SEER, NPCR, and/or NAACCR.
Errors in reporting race/ethnicity in medical records and on
death certificates may result in underestimates of cancer
incidence and mortality rates in nonwhite and nonblack popula-
tions. This is particularly relevant for American Indian/Alaska
Native populations. It is also important to note that cancer data
in the United States are primarily reported for broad, heteroge-
neous racial and ethnic groups, masking substantial and impor-
tant
differences
in
the
cancer
burden
within
these
subpopulations. For example, although Hispanics in the United
States have the lowest lung cancer mortality overall (one-half
that in NHWs), within this population, rates in Cuban men
approach those of NHW men.79 Similarly, lung cancer rates are
equivalent in Hawaiian and NHW men, but about 50% lower
in Asian/Pacific Islanders overall.63 Thus, the high burden of
lung and other cancers among Cuban Americans and Hawaiians
is completely concealed by the presentation of aggregated data.
Conclusions
The continuous decline in cancer death rates over 2 decades
has resulted in an overall drop of 26%, resulting in approxi-
mately 2.4 million fewer cancer deaths during this time
period. While the racial gap in cancer mortality continues to
narrow, this progress primarily reflects older age groups,
masking stark persistent inequalities for young and middle-
aged black Americans. High cancer mortality in Kentucky
and West Virginia, irrespective of race, highlights the strong
influence of socioeconomic and health policy factors on the
cancer burden. Nevertheless, the elimination of racial dis-
parities in many states, let alone lower cancer mortality in
blacks in Massachusetts and New York, demonstrates the
potential for the nation. Advancing the fight against cancer
for all citizens requires broader application of existing cancer
control knowledge, including smoking cessation and the
increased uptake of cancer-preventing cervical and colorectal
cancer screening and HPV vaccination, across all segments
of the population, with an emphasis on disadvantaged
groups. �
