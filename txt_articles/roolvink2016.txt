Abstract 
Background: The impact of i.v. β-blockers before primary PCI (pPCI)on infarct size and 
clinical outcomes is not well established, with only one prior study showing benefit of early i.v. 
metoprolol before pPCI.The Early- Beta-blocker Administration before primary PCI in patients 
with ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (Early-BAMI) trial, is the first double-blinded, placebo-
controlled international multicenter study testing the effect of early i.v. β-blockers before pPCI in 
a general STEMI population. 
Methods: STEMI patients presenting  <12h from symptom onset, Killip I-II, without AV 
block,were 1:1 randomized  to i.v. metoprolol (2x5 mg bolus) or matched placebo before 
primary PCI. Primary endpoint was myocardial infarct size as assessed by magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) at 30 days. Secondary endpoints were enzymatic infarct size and incidence of 
ventricular arrhythmias. Safety endpoints included symptomatic bradycardia, symptomatic 
hypotension, and cardiogenic shock. 
Results: A total of 683patients (mean age was 62±12 years (75% male) were randomized to 
metoprolol (n=336) or placebo (n=346). MRI was performed in 342 patients (54,8%). No 
significant differences in baseline characteristics were observed. Infarct size (% of LV) by MRI 
did not differ between the metoprolol (15.3 ± 11.0%) and placebo group (14.9 ± 11.5% 
p=0.616). Peak and area under the creatine kinase (CK) curve did not differ between both 
groups. Left ventricular ejection fraction by MRI was 51.0 ± 10.9% in the metoprolol group and 
51.6 ± 10.8% in the placebo group, p=0.68. The incidence of malignant arrhythmias was 3.6% in 
the metoprolol group vs 6.9% in placebo p=0.050. The incidence of adverse events was not 
different between groups. 
Conclusion: In a non-restricted STEMI population, early intravenous metoprolol before pPCI, 
was not associated with a reduction in infarct size. Metoprolol reduced the incidence of 
malignant arrhythmias in the acute phase and was not associated with an increase in adverse 
events.

Background 
Despite advances in the care for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction 
(STEMI), mortality in these patients remains relative high, especially in an allcomer population 
(1). Although early diagnosis and treatment have improved outcome of these patients, additional 
interventions early after onset of ischemia might further improve outcome. In the clinical 
guidelines, treatment with β-blockers for STEMI patients is recommended (2), although the 
evidence of mortality reduction with β-blockers after reperfusion therapy is limited (2-4). 
Whether administration before reperfusion improves clinical outcome or reduces myocardial 
infarct size is less clear. Experimental studies have conflicting results whether β-blockers 
decrease the extent of myocardial necrosis (4-6). In clinical studies in STEMI, the effect of early 
β-blockade was mostly studied in the prereperfusion era, with inconclusive results (7-10). In the 
era of thrombolysis, 2 randomized controlled trials testing the effect of β-blockers in STEMI 
showed no reduction in mortality with β-blocker treatment (11,12). In patients treated by primary 
percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI), only 2 randomized controlled trials studied the effect 
of early β-blocker treatment. Hanada et al observed in a small study (n = 96) that continuous 
intravenous landiolol immediately after primary PCI was associated with an improvement of left 
ventricular (LV) function (13). The Effect of Metoprolol in Cardioprotection During an Acute 
Myocardial Infarction (METOCARD-CNIC) trial (n=220) showed that intravenous metoprolol 
administrated before primary PCI reduces infarct size and preserved  LV function (14-16). In the 
latter trial however, only patients with an anterior location of STEMI were included, and the trial 
was neither blinded nor placebo controlled. We present the results of the Early-BAMI trial, the 
first double-blinded, placebo-controlled multicenter international study, assessing the effect of 
early i.v. β-blocker therapy before pPCI in a less restricted STEMI population (17).

Methods 
The primary objective of the EARLY-BAMI trial ( EudraCT no.: 2010-023394-19.) was 
to assess the effect of early, prehospital pre-reperfusion administration of intravenous metoprolol 
on myocardial infarct size in patients with STEMI eligible for primary PCI. The design of the 
study has previously been published (17). The study was approved by the medical ethical 
committees of the participating hospitals. It concerns a multicenter, multinational, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial. A total of 5 PCI centers and 3 ambulance services 
in The Netherlands and 9 PCI centers and 1 ambulance service in Spain enrolled patients. All 
centers had a long-standing experience in the pre-hospital diagnosis, triage and treatment of  
STEMI patients in the ambulance and were part of a STEMI network. The trial was conducted 
with a research grant of the Dutch Heart Foundation (Utrecht, Netherlands, no. 2010B125) and 
an unrestricted grant of MedtronicInc. (Heerlen, The Netherlands) for additional analyses. 
Study protocol 
Patients aged > 18 years with symptoms of acute STEMI for >30 minutes but < 12 hours 
and ST elevation > 1 mV in 2 adjacent ECG leads or new left bundle branch block (LBBB) were 
eligible for enrollment. The diagnosis of STEMI was made by the ambulance medical personnel. 
Electrocardiogram transmission to a physician at the PCI center could be performed to allow 
confirmation of the diagnosis. After the diagnosis of STEMI in the ambulance, medical treatment 
in all patients occurred as per current guidelines with the administration of 500 mg of aspirin 
intravenously, 600 mg clopidogrel or 180 mg of ticagrelor orally, and 5,000 International Units 
of unfractionated heparin intravenously. Exclusion criteria were Killip class III and IV, systolic 
blood pressure < 100 mmHg, heart rate < 60 bpm, type II and III atrioventricular block, history 
of previous MI, known asthma bronchiale, pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator

(ICD) implantation (no MRI possible), pregnancy or breastfeeding or inability to provide 
informed consent. If patients fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria, verbal informed consent 
was obtained. The trained ambulance paramedic completed the administration / enrolment 
procedure. After informed consent, a blinded study medication box was opened. This box 
contained 2 vials with metoprolol 5 mg or matched placebo and was labeled with a number that 
corresponded with the randomization list. Randomization took place without stratification and in 
blocks of 4. The first bolus of study medication was given in the ambulance, the second bolus in 
the PCI hospital at the catheterization laboratory before the PCI procedure only if systolic blood 
pressure was >100 mmHg and heart rate >60 bpm. Given that in the COMMIT CC2 trial (12), 
15mg of metoprolol administration in a short interval was associated with a slight increase in 
cardiogenic shock (although this was restricted to Killip III patients), the reference ethics 
committee suggested to reduce the dose to 10mg separated into two 5mg boluses: the first 5mg 
bolus during ambulance transit, and the second 5mg bolus on arrival at the cath lab (i.e. 
immediately before initiating the PCI). The results of the METOCARD-CNIC trial (using 15 mg 
metoprolol) were not known at the time of the study design. Patients participating in the trial 
were treated during hospital admission and thereafter according to current guidelines. During 
PCI, the use of thrombus aspiration and the use of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa inhibitors was left at the 
discretion of the operator. In addition, stenting was performed with a second-generation drug-
eluting stent. After PCI, patients received detailed written study information in which the 
protocol and the MRI follow up was explained in more detail, whereafter written informed 
consent was obtained.All patients were planned to receive oral metoprolol within 12 hours after 
PCI, according to current guidelines, during hospitalization. At discharge, all patients received

oral metoprolol at a dose recommended by their treating physician. Follow-up included visits at 
the outpatient clinic at each center and allowed us to obtain data for follow-up. 
End points 
The primary end point was myocardial infarct size (% infarcted myocardium, % of LV) 
as measured by MRI at 30 days (±10 days). The secondary efficacy end points were peak 
creatine kinase (CK), peak CK-MB, troponin at 24 hours, and area under the CK and CK-MB 
curve during the first 24 hours, residual ST deviation 1 hour after PCI/coronary angiogram, 
ventricular arrhythmias requiring defibrillation during transportation and hospitalization and 
major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as cardiac death, nonfatal reinfarction, or target 
vessel revascularization at 30 days. The secondary safety end points include symptomatic 
bradycardia, symptomatic hypotension, and cardiogenic shock.The following subgroups were 
prespecified for analysis: anterior versus nonanterior infarctions, patients presenting <6 hours 
after symptom onset versus patients presenting >6 hours, and occluded (Thrombolysis In 
Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 0 and 1 flow) infarct-related vessel at time of PCI versus open 
(TIMI 2 and 3 flow) infarct-related vessel. 
Statistical methods 
Sample size calculation 
Initially, the study was designed and initiated with enzymatic infarct size as primary end 
point. However, after inclusion of 164 patients, the primary end point was changed into a MRI 
based end point (at 3 July 2013), which was approved by the steering committee and the medical 
ethical committee. The original primary outcome measure was enzymatic infarct size measured 
by cardiac troponin T, and required 770 patients, based on the assumption that pre-hospital 
administration of 2x 5mg metoprolol iv would give a relative 20% reduction in infarct size.

(alpha = 0.05, power 80%, mean troponin T 3.34 ng/L, SD:3.30).This original primary outcome, 
became a secondary outcome after the change in the protocol. The change in the primary 
outcome was primarily made in order to reduce the necessary sample size and a time limitation 
of financial funding. Also, infarct size could be studied more precisely with MRI. The change 
occurred while the investigators were still entirely blinded to trial results, and without any 
interim analysis performed. The sample size was than determined for the primary end point of 
the trial by a power analysis with reasonable clinical and statistical assumptions. With an 
expected infarct size of 28% (18) in a population under standard treatment (no β-blockers pre-
PCI), we considered a reduction in infarct size from 28% to 23.5% clinically relevant. Assuming 
an SD of the myocardial infarction (MI) size measured by MRI equal to 10% (19), the power 
analysis indicated a total sample size of 326 patients (163 subjects in each group) was needed to 
achieve 80% power with significance level of 0.05 to detect a difference in infarct size. 
Patients who died after completing the MRI study were included in the primary outcome 
analysis. Patients who died before performance of the MRI were not included in the primary 
outcome analysis; however, they were included in the secondary outcome analysis because death 
within 1 year is a secondary end point. Statistical analysis was performed with Statistical 
Analysis System, SAS, version 9.3 and with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 
(SPSS, IBM) version 22.0. Continuous data was expressed as mean ± SD of mean and 
categorical data as percentage, unless otherwise denoted. The analysis of variance and the χ2 test 
was appropriately used for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. For quantitative 
variables data were expressed as mean +/- SD and median with first and third quartiles. Non 
normal data were compared by non-parametric methods (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) and normal 
data by parametric methods. Categorical data were expressed as percentages and compared by

Chi Square test (or Fischer Exact test when appropriate). For all analyses, statistical significance 
was assumed when the 2-tailed P < 0.05. 
Cardiac MRI analysis 
All MRI studies were performed blinded to treatment allocation and according to a 
centralized protocol. Dedicated sequences evaluating cardiac function, myocardial edema, 
myocardial perfusion, and myocardial necrosis/fibrosis were performed. All MRI studies were 
stored and further analyzed in a central core laboratory at the Centro Nacional de 
Intervestigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC) in Madrid, Spain. Analysis of MRI 
studies were performed in a random manner by expert observers blinded to treatment allocation. 
Quantification was performed on a separate workstation using a dedicated software package 
(QMass MR 7.6; Medis, Leiden, the Netherlands). In all MRI studies, the following information 
was determined: LV volumes, LV function, and myocardial delayed enhancement. Myocardial 
necrosis was defined by the extent of abnormal delayed enhancement. All measurements were 
expressed as percentage of the total LV myocardial volume; the absolute MI size was also 
quantified in grams. All results were given in absolute numbers and indexed by patients’ body 
surface. Differences between the 2 groups was estimated by multivariable linear regression 
adjusted for the participating hospital center and the stratification variables. 
Results 
Between February 2012 and November 2015, 684 patients were enrolled in 14 
participating hospitals and 4 ambulance services in the Netherlands and Spain. In one patient the 
box with the study medication was lost during transportation and this patient was excluded from 
the analysis. The 683 remaining patients were randomized to metoprolol (n=336) or placebo 
(n=347) before primary PCI. Mean age was 62±12 years (75% males). A flow diagram is shown

in Figure 1. Baseline characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 1. Although 
time from onset of complaints till first medical contact was comparable between the two groups, 
early presenters (< 6 hours after complaints onset) were more often present in the metoprolol 
group. At inclusion (before randomization), mean blood pressure on admission was comparable 
between the two groups, while mean heart rate was not-significantly lower in the metoprolol 
group (78.6 beats/min vs 80.5 beats/min, p=0.09). A total of 20 patients (2.9%) were enrolled at 
the emergency department of the PCI center, mainly because transportation of the patient to 
thePCI center was very short. In these patients, the fist study bolus was given as soon as possible 
at the emergency department, and the second bolus at arrival at the cath lab. 
Of the 336 patients allocated to pre-reperfusion metoprolol, 81.1% received also the 
second bolus, compared to 86% in the placebo group (p=0.08). Blood pressure before the second 
bolus (administered at the cath lab) was not different between groups, while heart rate was lower 
in the metoprolol group. Coronary angiography was performed in 99% of patients, similar in the 
metoprolol and placebo groups. One-vessel disease was observed in 53% of the metoprolol 
group compared to 59% of the placebo group (p=0.06). Initial TIMI flow 0 or 1 was 
demonstrated in 62% of the patients in the metoprolol group versus 60% in the placebo group 
(p= 0.61). Primary PCI was performed in 93% (metoprolol group) and 92% (placebo group, 
p=0.66), and was successful in 97% in both groups (p=0.70). Oral metoprolol was initiated 
within 24 hours in 78% in the metoprolol group and 73% of patients in the placebo group 
(p=0.13). 
Primary Endpoint 
MRI was performed in 342 of the 520 patients (66%) who were included after the change 
of the primary end point.(67% in the metoprolol group and 67% in the placebo group, p=0.77).

In the 342 patients who had MRI performed, no major differences in baseline characteristics 
between the treatment groups were present.In the MRI sample size calculation, we accounted for 
a drop out of 20%. But the actual drop out rate was higher (34%), so to meet the needed number 
of MRI, patient recruitment was continued until the needed number of 326 analyzed MRI’s was 
reached. The main reasons why MRI were not performed were claustrophobia, planning out of 
the time window of one month ± 10 days and refusal by patient due to transfer to a different 
hospital. All causes are listed in Figure 1. 
The primary end point, mean infarct size (% delayed enhancement of LV) in the 
metoprolol group was15.29%±10.97 versus 14.91%± 11.52 in the placebo group (p=0.616). Pre-
reperfusion administration of iv metoprolol did not improve LVEF on MRI (50.97%± 10.93% 
versus 51.65%± 10.83% in the placebo group). These findings are summarized in Table 2. 
Secondary Endpoints 
The peak creatinine kinase (CK), peak CK-MB and troponin levels at 24 hours were 
available in 591 (86.4%) patients. Peak CK was 2102 ± 2029 U/L in the metoprolol group vs 
2072 ± 2018 U/L in the placebo group. p=0.88. Mean single Troponin T measured at 24 hours of 
hospitalisation period was 3711 ±  3587 ng/L in the metoprolol group versus 3166 ±  3998 ng/L 
in the placebo group (p=0.1). Results of enzymatic infarct size are summarized in figure 2 and 3 
(area under the curve). 
Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 30 days occurred in 19 patients (6.2%) in the 
metoprolol group and 22 patients (6.9%) in the placebo group (P=0.72). 
Safety Endpoints 
Pre-Reperfusion administration of iv metoprolol did not change the incidence of the 
prespecified secondary safety endpoints.  There were 16 (4.8%) safety events in the metoprolol

group and 11(3.2%) events in the placebo group, p=0.271. Safety endpoints and adverse cardiac 
events are presented in table 3. Bradycardia was observed in 4.2% in the metoprolol group, 
compared to 2.6% in the placebo group (p=0.25).There was however a borderline significant 
reduction in the occurrence of malignant arrhythmias in the acute phase in the metoprolol group, 
12 patients (3.6%) vs 24 patients (6.9%, P=0.050). 
Prespecified subgroup analysis 
Infarct size 1 month after STEMI did not differ in patients presenting with an anterior 
infarction between the metoprolol group (18.8 ± 12.2%) and the placebo group (19.3 ± 12.7%. 
p=0.33). The infarct size in patients with a non-anterior infarction was 12.2 ± 8.0% in the 
metoprolol group and 10.4±7.8 in the placebo group. Patients presenting <6 hours after symtom 
onset also did not benefit from pre-reperfusion metoprolol administration compared to patients 
presenting > 6 hours after symptom onset. Infarct size in patients with an occluded vessel (TIMI 
0 and 1 flow) at the time of coronary angiography did not differ between the metoprolol and 
placebo group (17.8 ± 10.8 versus 18.1 ± 11.8%. p=0.74). Data from these prespecified 
subgroups are shown in Figure 4. 
Discussion 
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, in patients with STEMI undergoing 
primary PCI, pre-reperfusion administration of up to 10 mg metoprolol i.v. was safe, but had no 
effect on infarct size or LVEF. 
β-Blockers have multiple actions on the heart. Blockade of β1 receptors results in slowing 
of heart rate, reduction in myocardial contractility, and lowering of systemic blood pressure. In 
the context of acute myocardial infarction, which represents a state of reduced oxygen supply to 
the affected portion of the heart, these effects may be beneficial, as they result in reduced

myocardial workload and oxygen demand. Furthermore, β-blockers decrease the incidence of 
life-threatening arrhythmias, reinfarction, and recurrent ischemia, preventing LV remodeling 
(11,13-15,18-21). They have demonstrated to be beneficial, resulting in a mortality reduction in 
patients with reduced LV function  and when administered after MI. However, there is debate 
whether pre-reperfusion administration of intravenous β-blockers may reduce reperfusion injury 
as compared with post reperfusion administration (22). 
The MIAMI trial tested the effect of pre-reperfusion metoprolol (3 × 5 mg intravenous) 
versus placebo in STEMI (n = 5778) treated by thrombolysis and  demonstrated no effect of 
metoprolol (11). In the COMMIT CC2 trial (n = 45,825), intravenous metoprolol 3 × 5mg 
intravenous followed by oral administration up to 4 weeks did not improve survival in STEMI 
patients (12). However, this was mainly caused by a higher incidence of cardiogenic shock in 
patients treated by early β-blocker, possibly due to inclusion of patients with heart failure. In the 
current era of primary PCI, the METOCARD-CNIC trial showed reduced infarct size and 
increased LV ejection fraction in STEMI patients without signs of heart failure treated with early 
intravenous metoprolol (14,23). However, this study had a relatively small sample size (N=270), 
was not blinded, not placebo controlled, and included a selected patient group (anterior STEMI 
presenting < 6 hours from symptom onset). Our study included all patients with STEMI, with a 
double-blinded, placebo controlled design. Our results do not confirm the effect observed in the 
METOCARD-CNIC trial. One possible explanation could be that the METOCARD-CNIC trial 
included only anterior infarctions, The average infarct size (infarcted myocardium, % LV) in the 
METOCARD-CNIC trial was 21.2% in patients treated with iv metoprolol, compared to 15.3% 
in our study. These differences could support this theory. The smaller the infarctions, the less 
likely an additional treatment effect can be demonstrated. However, also the subgroup with

anterior infarction had no benefit of early beta blocker treatment.In METOCARD-CNIC, the 
dose of metoprolol was higher, up to 3 times 5 mg (15 mg target dose), whereas in our trial only 
two times 5 mg (10 mg target dose) was given. Another explanation can be that 18.8% of 
patients in our trial were on long term beta-blocker treatment before admission, however this was 
an exclusion criteria in the METOCARD trial. Also the timing of the MRI can be of influence. In 
the METOCARD trial 2 MRI’s were performed: One at 5-7 days, and the second at 6 months. 
Data from the first MRI at 5-7 days showed an improvement in LVEF in the metoprolol group 
and a significant reduction in infarct size. The follow-up MRI data at 6 months showed an even 
more significant difference in LVEF favoring the metoprolol group, but with no significant 
difference in infarct size any more.  Comparing the MRI infarct size as % of LV in the 
metoprolol group, it was 15.7% ± 9.6 in the METOCARD-CNIC trial at 6 months; vs 15.3% ± 
11.0 in our trial at one month. Another potential reason responsible for the different effect 
observed in this trial compared to the METOCARD-CNIC trial is the timing of metoprolol 
administration: A recent subanalysis of the METOCARD-CNIC trial (24), showed that the 
timing of metoprolol administration is a critical factor accouting for its infarct-limiting effect. 
That subanalysis, showed that only patients receiving i.v. metoprolol long before reperfusion had 
a reduction in infarct size. METOCARD-CNIC trial patients receiving i.v. metoprolol close to 
pPCI had significantly larger infarctions than those receiving i.v. metoprolol long before 
reperfusion, and similar to control patients. In the present Early-BAMI trial, the second 5mg 
bolus (to complete the 10mg target dose) was administered per protocol immediately before 
catheterization (median time from bolus and reperfusion 14 min). The first 5mg of iv metoprolol 
might be insufficient to attain cardio protection, in fact blood pressure after the first bolus of 
medication (i.e. before second bolus) was not different between metoprolol and placebo arms in

this trial, supporting the low-dosing hypothesis. Based on these data, and the conflicting results 
with METOCARD-CNIC, additional randomized trials are needed to clarify whether early beta-
blocker treatment has any effect in these patients. We advocate that future studies should test the 
cardioprotective effects of i.v. metoprolol in STEMI patients and should have a target dose of 
15mg and administer medication immediately after STEMI diagnosis to allow a maximum “on-
board” metoprolol time before reperfusion. Given the reduced observed infarct size, with a trial 
of our sample size, the reduction in infarct size by metoprolol should be at least 3.5% to 
demonstrate a significant difference between the borh groups. The safety profile, low cost, and 
the reduction of acute malignant arrhythmias seen in this trial encourage the performance of 
additional larger trials in this regard. 
In most randomized trials in which infarct size or LVEF was measured with MRI, MRI 
was performed at one month (25,26). This was the main reason why we choose one month in our 
trial.  All participating PCI centres and ambulance services had a long-standing experience in 
prehospital triage and treatment of STEMI patients. Regional differences in systems of care in 
which prehospital drug administration in the ambulance differ (Europe vs US), can lead to 
different interpretation of these study results to daily practice. 
Limitations 
During the course of the trial, the primary endpoint was changed from enzymatic infarct 
size to infarct size measured by MRI. The change in the primary outcome was made in order to 
reduce the necessary sample size and infarct size could be studied more precisely with MRI. The 
results from enzymatic infarct size analysis however were completely in line with the results 
from the primary MRI end point.

The trial was powered with a reduction of infarct size from 28% to 23.5%. The smaller 
than estimated infarct size in this trial (15.1%) could affect the neutral effect of the trial, (the 
smaller the infarct size, the less probability thata difference could be found). However, also in 
the larger anterior infarctions there was no observed effect. Also patients who died before MRI 
was performed, with probably larger infarctions, may have caused a selection of patients with 
smaller infarctions who had MRI. 
Although we defined several sub analyses, these analyses should be interpreted with 
caution, since the included patients in several subgroups were small. It was not possible to blind 
physicians and nurses for heart rate and blood pressure. However, analyses of MRI (primary end 
point) were blinded for both heart rate and study medication.  
Conclusions 
Early pre-reperfusion administration ofintravenous metoprolol, at a dose of 10 mg (2 x 5 
mg) had no beneficial effects on infarct size in patients with STEMI treated by primary PCI.
