A novel enzyme with antioxidant  
capacity produced by the 
ubiquitous skin colonizer 
Propionibacterium acnes

The role of the skin microbiota in human health is poorly understood. Here, we identified and 
characterized a novel antioxidant enzyme produced by the skin microbiota, designated RoxP for radical 
oxygenase of Propionibacterium acnes. RoxP is uniquely produced by the predominant skin bacterium 
P. acnes, with no homologs in other bacteria; it is highly expressed and strongly secreted into culture 
supernatants. We show that RoxP binds heme, reduces free radicals, and can protect molecules 
from oxidation. Strikingly, RoxP is crucial for the survival of P. acnes in oxic conditions and for skin 
colonization of P. acnes ex vivo. Taken together, our study strongly suggests that RoxP facilitates  
P. acnes’ survival on human skin, and is an important beneficial factor for the host-commensal 
interaction. Thus, RoxP is the first described skin microbiota-derived mutualistic factor that potentially 
can be exploited for human skin protection.
Propionibacterium acnes is one of the most commonly isolated bacteria from human skin1–3. This Gram positive 
facultative anaerobe has been suggested to be involved in several skin disorders, acne vulgaris being the most 
notable4. Furthermore, P. acnes can adhere to and form biofilms on orthopedic implants5, and is therefore associ-
ated with infections of prosthetic devices6,7. However, P. acnes is an ubiquitous microorganism on skin, at certain 
parts outnumbering the aerobes 100-folds8; it can mono-colonize pilosebaceous units of human skin9 without 
causing any disease in most individuals. Therefore, it has been suggested that colonization by P. acnes might be 
beneficial for the human host10,11. In agreement with a beneficial function, absence of P. acnes has been associated 
with the development of psoriasis12, even though a putative protective role of P. acnes remains to be experimen-
tally verified.
As a skin bacterium, P. acnes is constantly exposed to different environmental stresses, such as reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) produced from UV irradiated skin13, or from activated phagocytes14,15 and keratinocytes exposed 
to skin microbes16,17. Furthermore, P. acnes has to cope with the oxic environment present on the top layers of 
skin. P. acnes has evolved several defense mechanisms towards ROS. All strains are catalase positive18, and sev-
eral strains also have a high superoxide dismutase activity19. However, these two enzymes do not have typical 
protein sorting motifs (e.g. no signal peptide or LPXTG motif) based on the sequenced genome of P. acnes strain 
KPA17120220,21, and are thus likely to be intracellular proteins. Recently, Holland et al. identified the secretome of 
P. acnes using mass spectrometry, and found that the most abundantly secreted protein was PPA1939, annotated 
as a hypothetical protein, with no homology to existing database entries22. We hypothesize that this protein is of 
importance for the bacterium to survive in its habitat.
Here, we have shown that PPA1939 is a secreted enzyme with antioxidant activity, unique to and favorable for 
P. acnes to survive in oxic conditions, with implications for maintaining redox homeostasis on human skin. Due 
to this activity, we tentatively name this protein RoxP – Radical oxygenase of Propionibacterium acnes.
Results
Phylogenetic relationship of RoxP (PPA1939). 
RoxP (consisting of 161 amino acids) has so far only 
been annotated as a hypothetical protein, and has no conserved domains as judged from BLAST23 or pfam24 
searches, besides an N-terminal signal peptide motif. A multi-genome comparison has revealed that this gene is

present in the genomes of all P. acnes strains that have been sequenced so far (Supplementary Fig. 1). The only 
species, except P. acnes, that has a protein similar to RoxP is the closely related Propionibacterium humerusii. No 
other sequenced bacteria encode any proteins with sequence similarity to RoxP, according to a BLAST analysis.
To further study the conserved nature of roxP, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the amino acid 
sequences of RoxP homologs extracted from all publically available genomes of P. acnes and P. humerusii (Fig. 1, 
Supplementary Fig. 1). The phylogenetic tree reveals that RoxP is strikingly conserved. Most P. acnes strains have 
an identical RoxP, in particular strains of the P. acnes phylotype I, but also encompassing several strains of P. acnes 
type II. Using strain KPA171202 (type IB) as a reference strain, RoxP homologs in 58 strains are identical, while 
homologs in 33 other strains share a 99% sequence identity (160/161 amino acid identity). A distinct cluster 
(homologs with 83% identity) consists of 11 strains belonging to P. humerusii and some P. acnes type II. Strain 
SK182B harbors the most distantly related full-length RoxP homolog compared to the reference, sharing 81% 
amino acid identity. Noteworthy, four strains (three strains of different phylotypes are from the JCM collection) 
have a predicted truncated version of RoxP, due to a single base deletion (Supplementary Fig. 1). It cannot be 
ruled out that this represents sequencing errors, as the sequencing qualities of these genomes are low. No apparent 
discrepancy between phylotypes of P. acnes and the phylogenetic relationship of RoxP homologs could be found. 
In order to get a more complete picture, nine additional clinical isolates were screened for the presence of roxP, 
and sequenced (GenBank accession number JN051665-JN051673). All clinical isolates harbored a roxP that was 
identical or highly similar to roxP from previously sequenced genomes of P. acnes (83.2–100% amino acid iden-
tity), with seven strains being identical to KPA171202.
Figure 1. RoxP is highly conserved. The protein sequences of RoxP homologs were extracted from all available 
P. acnes genomes. The tree, generated by the minimum-evolution algorithm in MEGA version 5.2, illustrates 
that RoxP is highly conserved among the vast majority of P. acnes strains. Most strains (58) have an identical 
homolog, and 33 strains have highly similar homologs (99% identity). A subgroup of 11 RoxP homologs 
belonging to strains of P. acnes type II, type III, and P. humerusii are more distant (83% identity). Some genomes, 
such as JCM strains, encode a truncated RoxP. The bar represents the genetic distance.

Expression of roxP. 
A previous study, identifying all secreted proteins of P. acnes, has detected strong secre-
tion of RoxP in all tested strains of the phylotypes IA, IB, II and III22. Even though roxP is present in all studied 
strains of P. acnes, the expression of the gene may vary between distinct isolates, as it has been indicated by a 
recent study measuring the surface proteome and secretome25. Here, we investigated the roxP expression in three 
 
P. acnes strains by means of qRT-PCR. roxP is expressed both during exponential and stationary phase (Fig. 2a). 
Furthermore, all tested isolates express similar levels of roxP compared to the reference strain KPA171202, except 
isolate AD24 (a type II strain) that expressed significantly lower amounts of roxP (Fig. 2b).
RNA-sequencing of P. acnes supported the qRT-PCR data, showing that roxP is strongly and constitutively 
expressed in strains belonging to two different phylotypes of P. acnes (Fig. 2c,d). This supports the notion that roxP is 
important throughout the entire P. acnes population. RNA-sequencing further revealed the transcriptional start site, 
the presence of a long 5′ 
-untranslated region (UTR), and the possible promoter of roxP (Supplementary Fig. 2A). 
 
A phylogenetic analysis of the roxP upstream region, containing the transcriptional start site and the predicted 
promoter, in all P. acnes genomes revealed a highly conserved sequence (Supplementary Fig. 2B). The majority of 
strains (81%), including all type IA and IB strains and a few type II strains, possess a roxP upstream sequence that 
differs only in maximal 3 nucleotide positions. The remaining 18 strains belong to type IC, type II and type III as 
well as represent some strains of P. humerusii. In analogy with the RoxP phylogenetic analysis, strains of type II and 
P. humerusii cluster together, i.e. have the same roxP upstream region (Supplementary Fig. 2C).
Purification of RoxP. 
The unique presence of RoxP in P. acnes prompted us to investigate its function. Due 
to the high secretion levels of RoxP (∼ 
10 μ 
g/ml), we decided to purify natively secreted RoxP from the culture 
medium of P. acnes rather than expressing it recombinantly. The purification process was greatly facilitated due 
to the low molecular weight of the protein (15 kDa), and due to the fact that RoxP is the most abundant protein 
found in the supernatant of the culture medium of P. acnes22. By combining ammonium sulphate precipitation, 
a two-step ion-exchange chromatography (anionic and cationic) and size exclusion we could purify RoxP to 
approximately 95% homogeneity (Fig. 3a). The identity of the protein was confirmed with mass spectrometry 
(data not shown). The culture supernatant from 1000 ml bacterial suspension grown to stationary phase generally 
yielded 3 mg almost pure protein.
RoxP binds heme. 
It has long been recognized that P. acnes produces and secretes porphyrins20,26 as byprod-
ucts of the vitamin B12 biosynthesis pathway. The high production of porphyrins from P. acnes is exploited thera-
peutically to kill the bacterium27. Porphyrin-like molecules are usually used as co-factors in several proteins (such 
as the methylmalony-CoA mutase). It has not been studied if P. acnes secretes proteins containing porphyrins 
(e.g. protoporphyrin IX; further on denoted as heme). To investigate if RoxP could interact with heme, we studied 
its binding to hemin-agarose. RoxP bound strongly to the column (Fig. 3b), and could also be stained with the 
heme-specific stain o-dianisidine (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, incubation of RoxP with heme and subsequent desalt-
ing to remove excess of unbound heme revealed a protein with an absorbance spectrum characteristic for heme 
proteins with the absorbance peak around 400 nm (Soret band) (Fig. 3d).
RoxP acts as an antioxidant. 
Many heme proteins can modulate the redox status of molecules, being able 
to reduce oxidized macromolecules28. To investigate if RoxP has antioxidant effects, we incubated purified RoxP 
with preformed ABTS (2,2′ 
-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)-radicals. Addition of 0.34 μ 
M 
RoxP was able to reduce the free radicals in a time-dependent manner, reaching a plateau after 12 min (Fig. 4a,b). 
Increasing concentrations of RoxP resulted in immediate reduction of the absorbance to background levels. PBS 
served as a negative control, and vitamin E as a positive internal control, with the latter demonstrating a similar 
degree of antioxidant activity as RoxP (Supplementary Fig. 3).
To better be able to study the biological role of RoxP, we deleted roxP from P. acnes KPA171202 through 
mutagenesis according to a recently described protocol29. The deletion of roxP was verified by PCR amplification 
and sequencing (data not shown). The successful deletion of roxP was further verified by comparing the secreted 
protein fraction of P. acnes KPA171202 (wildtype) and the mutant strain KPA171202Δ 
roxP by 2D gel electropho-
resis. The prominent protein spot of RoxP in the 2D gel pattern of the secreted proteins of the wildtype strain was 
absent in the pattern of the Δ 
roxP-mutant strain (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Next, we investigated the ability of sterile filtered culture supernatants from wildtype and Δ 
roxP-mutant 
 
P. acnes to protect molecules from oxidation. As a proof of principle to study the antioxidant effect of RoxP, we 
measured the degradation of oxy-hemoglobin incubated with wildtype or Δ 
roxP-mutant strain-derived super-
natants, respectively. Oxidation of hemoglobin results in the degradation thereof, as detected by a decrease of 
Abs410 nm, while putative antioxidant effects of the supernatant will stabilize hemoglobin and limit degradation. 
The addition of wildtype supernatant resulted in no visible degradation of hemoglobin over a 5 h time period 
(Fig. 4c). However, addition of the Δ 
roxP-mutant supernatant resulted in complete degradation of hemoglobin 
within 5 h (Fig. 4d), indicating a reduced ability of the Δ 
roxP-mutant strain to protect the molecule (hemoglobin) 
from oxidative stress.
RoxP facilitates P. acnes survival in oxic environments in vitro. 
Other bacterial antioxidant pro-
teins have been suggested to be of importance for oxygen tolerance30. To investigate the importance of RoxP 
for P. acnes survival in an oxic environment, cultures were grown under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The 
Δ 
roxP-mutant strain had a slightly faster growth curve as compared to the wildtype during anaerobic con-
ditions (Fig. 5a, solid lines), but had a much slower growth during aerobic conditions (Fig. 5a, dashed lines). 
Likewise, wildtype P. acnes was able to survive in a normal air oxygen environment for an extended period of 
time, while the Δ 
roxP-mutant was sensitive to oxygen, with no live bacteria present after six days of incubation 
(Fig. 5b, solid lines). Addition of free RoxP (0.02 mg/ml) enhanced the initial survival of both the wildtype and

Figure 2. roxP is constitutively expressed in all strains. roxP expression was analyzed using qRT-PCR during 
exponential and stationary phase P. acnes strain KPA171202 (a) (n = 6). Differences in expression levels of roxP 
between individual isolates of P. acnes (KPA171202, AD5, AD24) was analyzed at exponential growth phase, 
normalized against gapdh, and presented as relative roxP expression with KPA171202 set as 1 (b) (n = 6). RNA-
sequencing of P. acnes revealed that roxP is strongly expressed in both exponential and stationary growth phases 
in different phylotypes of P. acnes (c,d), as well as transcriptional elements controlling the expression of roxP.

the Δ 
roxP-mutant strains (27 ± 
 16%, and 20 ± 
 22%, respectively), but had no lasting effect (Fig. 5b, dashed lines). 
Though a trend, the increased initial survival upon RoxP supplementation was not statistically significant.
RoxP is necessary for long-term P. acnes colonization of human skin. 
To further investigate 
the biological impact of RoxP for P. acnes, we colonized human skin ex vivo with wildtype and Δ 
roxP-mutant 
 
P. acnes. Briefly, skin explants from breast reduction surgery were removed of any subcutaneous fat, and punched 
to generate small (0.6 cm2) pieces of skin. The tissues could be maintained for several weeks in cell media. Bacteria 
were applied to the epidermal side of each explant. Both strains were able to initially adhere to and colonize the

skin (2 h after inoculum) (Fig. 5c–e), suggesting that the presence of RoxP is not involved in initial adherence 
to skin. However, after prolonged incubation (14 days), only the wildtype strain was significantly present on the 
skin, having propagated ∼ 
3 log, while the Δ 
roxP-mutant strain was barely detectable, even though demonstrat-
ing a higher initial adherence to cells (Fig. 5c,f–g). The presence of erythromycin as a selective pressure did not 
affect the growth of the Δ 
roxP-mutant in vitro (data not shown). Thus, this experiment revealed the crucial role 
of RoxP for the ability of P. acnes to long-term colonize human skin.

Discussion
Being one of the most common microorganisms on the skin, P. acnes has been attributed to be both a commensal 
and an opportunistic pathogen. Still, most individuals are asymptomatic carriers, with colonizing bacteria that 
may even benefit their host10. Colonizing the skin requires the bacterium to tolerate oxygen and be able to pro-
tect itself from ROS. Several enzymes involved in redox reactions, that are able to counteract oxidation, rely on 
heme as a co-factor for their activity. We therefore investigated if P. acnes secreted heme-containing proteins, and 
identified RoxP as an abundant heme protein. Though heme may not be present in measurable quantities on the 
skin, it has been reported that P. acnes produces several heme-like molecules, e.g. porphyrins26. The ability of these 
porphyrins to interact with RoxP and thus serve as an endogenous substrate is currently under investigation.
P. acnes has earlier been shown to harbor intracellular catalases and superoxide dismutases, enabling bacteria 
to cope with cytoplasmic oxidative stress31. However, the role of a secreted enzyme is likely different from that 
of intracellular enzymes. Here, we showed that RoxP is able to both reduce free radicals and protect molecules 
from oxidation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first characterized bacterial extracellular enzyme with 
antioxidant activity. In terms of activity, RoxP is on par with well-studied human antioxidants, including vitamin 
C, vitamin E and reduced gluthathione32, as well as with the plasma protein α 
1-microglobulin shown to have 
radical scavenging activity33. The antioxidant activity of RoxP might thus be beneficial for the bacterium as well 
as for the host, detoxifying free radicals on skin, suggesting a putative function of RoxP for maintaining the redox 
homeostasis on the skin.
In many skin diseases, including psoriasis, a significant lower abundance of P. acnes at the site of disease as 
well as for the skin in general has been detected12. Several lines of evidence suggest that skin diseases, including 
atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, are partly mediated by oxidative stress34. A dysbiosis in the skin microbiome, with 
a lowered abundance of P. acnes may thus confer a lowered ability to tolerate oxidative stress, thus culminating 
in a disrupted redox homeostasis. As such, colonization with P. acnes on the skin may confer protection against 
oxidative stress through its secreted protein RoxP, reducing the risk of developing several skin diseases. Further 
investigation into this area will be needed to confirm this hypothesis.
Regarding the bacterial advantage, RoxP is favorable for P. acnes in order to survive and grow in oxygen-rich 
environments. Being a skin commensal, though preferably in the deeper regions of the skin (e.g. sebaceous 
Figure 5. RoxP significantly facilitates the survival and colonization of P. acnes in oxic environments. The 
growth under anoxic (solid lines) and oxic (dashed lines) conditions for P. acnes strain KPA171202 (gray) and its 
isogenic Δ 
roxP-mutant (black) was followed by optical density measurements for six and ten days, respectively 
(a). A stationary phase culture of KPA171202 (gray) and the Δ 
roxP-mutant (black) was washed, and incubated in 
an oxic environment. To both samples, purified RoxP was added (0.02 mg/ml, dashed lines). Cfu was measured 
daily through plating of bacteria (b). P. acnes was added to human skin ex vivo from the breast region. Presence 
of P. acnes was measured 2 h and 14 days after inoculation and washing of the cells (n = 6) (c). Visual inspection 
of the skin biopsy using immunohistochemistry at 2 h (d,e) and 14 days (f,g) revealed the presence of wildtype 
bacteria at both time points (d,f), colonizing the top of epidermis, in between epidermis and dermis, and partly 
within epidermis and dermis. For the Δ 
roxP-mutant, presence of bacteria could only be detected 2 h (e) after 
inoculation, but not after 14 days (g). Arrows indicate bacteria. All images were recorded at a 40x magnification. 
All experiments were performed at least with three biological replicates, and are presented as mean ± SD.

follicles), it is inevitable that the bacterium will be exposed to oxygen. Thus, to cope with this stress, the bacterium 
must have evolved systems to handle oxygen and its radical species. For the same reasons, it is to be expected that 
such a factor would be constitutively and strongly expressed. This is in contrast to an intracellular heme oxygenase 
from Clostridium tetani, also suggested to be involved in oxygen tolerance, that preferentially is expressed in sta-
tionary phase30. Our data support the importance of RoxP for oxygen tolerance of P. acnes, enabling both growth 
and survival in an oxic environment. Interestingly, the isogenic Δ 
roxP-mutant displays an increased growth rate 
in anaerobic conditions, as compared to the wildtype. This may reflect the burden of the high production of RoxP 
in the wildtype, a protein of less importance in an anoxic environment. However, in an oxic environment, RoxP 
facilitates skin colonization of P. acnes. Since only the strain KPA171202 (type IB) was used, the results of our 
study are limited to this particular strain. This is the only strain of P. acnes that has so far been successfully genet-
ically manipulated. The used strain, however, has the most common roxP genotype, that is shared in type IA and 
IB strains as well as some type II strains. Thus, the results have likely a broader relevance. Still, we cannot rule out 
that other strains of P. acnes may differ in terms of their growth properties under oxic environments.
A constitutive expression of roxP is likely a necessity, since single addition of exogenous RoxP to P. acnes 
in an oxic environment only momentarily affected the viability of P. acnes, but had no significant long lasting 
effect. The reason for the lack of functionality of exogenous RoxP needs to be further investigated. It is possible 
that another factor might be necessary for full RoxP activity, or that the partial purification of RoxP has affected 
 
in vitro functionality.
Due to its ability to interact with heme, it is possible that RoxP can also interact with the porphyrins produced 
by P. acnes itself. How such an interaction will affect the production, and functionality of RoxP remains to be 
investigated, but may be a limiting factor for the activity of exogenously added RoxP in vivo.
RoxP has several evolutionary interesting features, being the most abundantly secreted protein from P. acnes22, 
unique for P. acnes and the tentatively named species P. humerusii, as well as highly conserved within these spe-
cies. This suggests that RoxP is of importance for their specific habitat, and might thus be of importance for the 
host-bacterium interaction.
The constitutive expression of RoxP distinguishes it from most common host-interacting factors, which often 
display growth phase-dependent expression35. The importance of secreted RoxP for the interplay between the 
RoxP-producing strain and its local environment is intriguing. Several other facultative anaerobes, including the 
common skin bacterium Finegoldia magna inhabits the skin36, but it has not been studied whether these bacteria 
have a symbiotic interaction, benefiting each other’s survival. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the puta-
tive symbiosis between skin bacteria.
Commensal bacteria on the skin are generally regarded to be beneficial for the host, but few mechanisms have 
been shown to support this notion. Here we have characterized a unique secreted antioxidant enzyme derived 
from P. acnes that protects the bacterium from oxidative damage, enables its survival in an oxic environment, and 
possibly assists in maintaining a healthy skin redox homeostasis. Further studies will elucidate the importance of 
RoxP for enabling symbiotic interactions between P. acnes and its human host.
Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions. 
P. acnes isolates were cultivated from − 
80 °C stock solutions 
in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB; Bacto, Mt Pritchard, NSW, Australia) under strict anaerobic conditions for 3–7 days, 
until reaching stationary phase. Additional information about the P. acnes isolates used can be found elsewhere5.
For oxygen-sensitivity experiments, P. acnes strain KPA171202 and the isogenic Δ 
roxP-mutant were cultured 
in TSB under strict anaerobic conditions (anaerobic workstation) until reaching stationary phase. All media were 
pre-reduced anaerobically for 24 hours, before addition of bacteria. Bacteria were diluted 1:100 in non-reduced 
TSB, and incubated at 37 °C in an oxygen atmosphere. Optical density at 620 nm was measured every 24 hours. 
Likewise, stationary phase bacteria were washed in PBS, and resuspended to a concentration of ∼ 
5 × 108 colony 
forming units (cfu)/ml. PBS or RoxP (0.02 mg/ml) was added, and samples were allowed to incubate at room 
temperature in an air oxygen-saturated environment. Samples were plated every 24 hours in order to count cfu.
Sequencing of roxP. 
The gene roxP was PCR-amplified in isolates AD9, AD20, AD24, AD26, AS4, AS8, 
AS23, AS26 and AS39 using primer roxP_for and roxP_rev (Table 1). The PCR product was gel purified (Qiagen) 
and ligated to the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instruction, before being transformed 
into E. coli TOP10 cells. Plasmids were purified and sequenced using GATC Lightrun.
roxP expression in P. acnes. 
P. acnes mRNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) supplemented 
with Bacteria Protect Reagent (Qiagen). Briefly, 1 ml P. acnes culture was pelleted, resuspended in a mixture of 
PBS and Bacteria Protect Reagent and incubated for 5 min. Bacteria were lysed in TE-buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl 
pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) containing 15 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich) and proteinase K (Qiagen); incubating 
for 10 min with agitation. Reagent RLT (RNeasy kit) was added and particles removed by centrifugation. The 
remaining supernatant was mixed with ethanol, and the sample added to RNeasy spin columns according to 
manufacturer’s instructions.
Gene expression of roxP and gapdh was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) using Power SYBR 
Green RNA-to-Ct 1-step Master Mix (ThermoFisher), 100 nM of primers (gapdh_for/rev, qRT-PCR_roxP_for/rev) 
 
(Table 1) together with 5–10 ng mRNA. Samples were run on an iCycler iQ (Bio-Rad) with reverse transcription 
at 48 °C for 30 min, followed by 95 °C for 10 min and 40 cycles with 15 s at 95 °C and 60 °C for 1 min. Gene expres-
sion levels were quantified using the Δ 
Δ 
Ct-method.

(type IA)) grown under anaerobic conditions to the exponential and stationary growth phase in BHI medium at

37 °C was prepared with the RNA PowerSoil Total RNA Isolation Kit (MoBio, USA), following manufacturer’s 
instructions. RNA quality was controlled using the Bioanalyzer (Agilen Technologies, USA). The cDNA libraries 
were constructed by Vertis Biotechnology AG, Germany, as previously described37,38. The cDNA libraries were 
sequenced using a HiSeq 2000 instrument (Illumina) in a single-read mode and 100 cycles. Detailed descrip-
tion of procedures used for quality control, read mapping, expression graph construction and normalization of 
expression graphs have been published previously37. For graph visualization the Integrative Genome Browser 
(IGB v8.5.4) was used39.
Phylogenetic analysis. 
A phylogenetic tree based on the extracted RoxP protein sequences of all P. acnes 
and P. humerusii genomes available in GenBank was generated using the minimum-evolution algorithm accord-
ing to the maximum composite likelihood model in the software program MEGA 5.240, and validated by boot-
strap analysis based on 500 replications.
Mutagenesis of P. acnes roxP. 
The RoxP knockout mutant was generated as described previously29. 
P. acnes strain KPA171202 was used as the wild-type strain and Escherichia coli DH5α 
 was used as a recipient 
in all cloning steps, unless stated otherwise. In brief, a 500 bp region upstream and a 500 bp region of the 3′ 
end of the gene PPA1939 (roxP) were amplified using the primer combinations PPA1939_1/PPA1939_2 and 
PPA1939_3/PPA1939_4 (Table 1), respectively. The fragments were gel-purified, digested with Acc65I and ligated. 
After column purification of the ligation mixture (QIAquick, Qiagen), a PCR was carried out using the ligation 
mixture as a template with the primer combination PPA1939_1/PPA1939_4. The 1 kb product was gel-purified 
and cloned into pGEM-T-Easy. Positive E. coli DH5α clones were obtained and isolated plasmids were tested for 
the correct insert by restriction digestion. Plasmid DNA was subsequently digested with Acc65I and ligated with 
the Acc65I-digested fragment containing the erythromycin-resistance cassette; this fragment was amplified using 
genomic DNA of Saccharopolyspora erythraea (DSM no. 40517) as a template using the primers ermE_for and 
ermE_rev (Table 1). The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli DH5α 
. Ampicillin (100 μ 
g/ml)-resistant 
clones were obtained. Prior to electroporation into P. acnes KPA171202, plasmid DNA was extracted from posi-
tive clones and transformed into the dam-negative E. coli strain GM2199.
Competent cells of P. acnes KPA171202 were prepared as described previously29. Electrocompetent P. acnes 
cells were freshly prepared before the electroporation, which was carried out using a GenePulser (BioRad), and 
0.1 cm electroporation cuvettes. Plasmid DNA (6 μ 
g; isolated from the dam-negative E. coli strain GM2199) was 
added to 50 μ 
l competent P. acnes cells. GenePulser settings of 50 μ 
F, 400 Ω and 1.5 kV were used. Subsequently, 
cells were recovered in 1 ml pre-warmed BHI medium, and centrifuged (5 min, 3000 g). The resulting pellet was 
resuspended in 100 μ 
l BHI broth and plated out on a Brucella agar plate without any antibiotics. The plate was 
incubated for 24 h at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions. On the following day, bacteria were harvested using a 
sterile cotton swab, resuspended and washed in pre-warmed BHI broth, and re-plated on Brucella agar plates 
containing 10 μ 
g/ml erythromycin, and incubated for 4–6 days. All obtained clones were tested by PCR to validate 
the correct knock-out of PPA1939.
Purification of RoxP. 
Stationary phase P. acnes isolate KPA171202 were collected by centrifugation at 3600 g 
for 10 min. The culture supernatant was sterile filtered (0.22 μ 
m) and precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate. 
The pellet was resolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8 and dialyzed overnight (MWCO 3,500). The sample was 
loaded on an equilibrated HiTrap Q FF column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), and eluted with 50 mM NaCl 
(10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8). A second dialysis was performed (50 mM NaOAc-HOAc pH 5.0), samples were run on 
a HiTrap SP FF column (GE Healthcare), and eluted with 100 mM NaCl (50 mM NaOAc-HOAc pH 5.0). Finally, 
fractions were run through a 50 kDa MWCO-filter (Amicon Ultra, Ultracel-50K). The homogeneity of RoxP was 
verified using SDS-PAGE gels.
MALDI-TOF analysis. 
Culture supernatant from stationary phase P. acnes isolate KPA171202 was precip-
itated with 0.2% v/v HCl in acetone. The proteins were pelleted (10,000 g, 30 min, 4 °C) and supernatant dis-
carded. The pellet was dissolved in 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, and the proteins were separated on a 12%

SDS-PAGE41, and stained with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Bands were cut out using a sterile scalpel and 
analyzed using MALDI-TOF MS/MS as described elsewhere42. Briefly, the gel spots were destained with 50% 
acetonitrile (ACN) in 25 mM NH4HCO3, and reduced and alkylated using DTT and iodoacetamide, respectively. 
The gel spots were washed with NH4HCO3, dehydrated with ACN, and dried using a speed vacuum. The gel 
spots were digested with trypsin (Promega) over night at 37 °C. Peptides were eluted with the addition of 5% 
trifluoroacetic acid in 75% ACN. Eluted peptides (1 μ 
l) were spotted on a target plate before a matrix of 2 mg/ml 
 
alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was added. Additionally 1 μ 
l of peptides was added in order to increase 
the signal. The analysis was performed on an ESI-TRAP (Waters), using a mass range m/z from 50–1800. Only 
spectra from ions with charge states 2 and 3 were acquired.
Hemin agarose purification. 
Hemin agarose suspension (1:1) (Sigma-Aldrich) was washed with 20 mM 
Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl 3 × 
 5 min. RoxP from P. acnes isolate KPA171202 (15 μ 
l) was added to 100 μ 
l hemin 
agarose, incubated for 2 h at room temperature and washed 5 × 
 500 μ 
l with Tris-HCl pH 7.5. The sample was 
finally pelleted (8,000 g 2 min) and resuspended in 30 μ 
l Nu-PAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) and reducing agent 
(Invitrogen). The samples were incubated for 10 min at 70 °C, pelleted and applied to the 4–12% gradient gel.
Electrophoresis and o-dianisidine staining. 
SDS-PAGE was performed using reducing conditions 
as described by Laemmli41. For heme-staining, Nu-PAGE gels, 4–12% (Invitrogen) were used. Samples were 
incubated for 30 min at 20 °C with sample buffer containing 0.25 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8, bromophenol blue, 2% 
SDS and 25 mM DTT (final concentration). The gels were pre-run for 1 h before loading of the samples. After 
electrophoresis (100 V) the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue G-250 for detection of proteins or 6 mM 
ortho-dianisidine-HCl (o-dianisidine-HCl) and 18 mM H2O2 for detection of heme. After electrophoresis the 
gels were washed in 10% TCA for 10 min, washed twice with H2O for 10 min, and finally incubated in 20 ml stain 
containing 2 ml 0.5 M Na-citrate, pH 4.4, 6 mM o-dianisidine-HCl and 0.4 ml H2O2. The staining was stopped 
after 30 min and kept in water.
Binding of heme to RoxP. 
Heme (0.5 mM in DMSO) was incubated with 15 μ 
g RoxP, desalted on 
pre-equilibrated PD10 columns (GE Healthcare, Sweden) and the top fractions used for analysis.
2D protein gel analysis of secreted proteins. 
This method has been previously described22. In brief, 
wildtype and mutant strains were cultured at 37 °C on Brucella agar plates under anaerobic conditions for three 
days. Plate-grown bacteria were resuspended and washed in BHI broth. Twenty ml BHI broth was inoculated 
with P. acnes (OD600 0.01) and grown for 12–72 h at 37 °C and 160 rpm in an anaerobic jar. After 14–18 h, the 
cultures typically reached the mid-exponential growth phase with an OD600 of 0.5–0.6. The exponential cultures 
were centrifugated for 15 min at 20,000 g, 4 °C, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μ 
m filter to remove 
residual bacteria. Extracellular proteins were precipitated using a modified trichloroacetic acid (TCA) method as 
described previously43. In brief, the filtrate (100 ml) was mixed with 100% TCA to a final concentration of 10% 
and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The mixture was centrifugated for 30 min (20,000 g, 4 °C) and the resulting pellet 
resuspended in 100 ml of acetone and dissolved using an ultrasonic water bath. The mixture was centrifugated 
as before, washed twice with acetone, and the resulting pellet air dried. For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, 
protein samples were solubilized for 30 min at ambient temperature in 9 M urea-1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dim
ethylammonia]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS)-70 mM dithiotheitol (DTT)-2% Servalyte 2–4 (Serva). Protein 
species were separated by a small-gel-2-DE system44. The samples containing 200 μ 
g of protein were applied to 
the anodic side of the isoelectric focusing gel containing ampholytes in the pH range 2–11. The SDS-PAGE of 
the second dimension was performed using 15% acrylamide gels (7 cm × 8 cm). Protein spots were visualized by 
staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250.
Antioxidant effect on ABTS-radicals. 
2,2′ 
-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammo-
nium salt (ABTS) was dissolved in ddH2O to a concentration of 7 mM. Production of ABTS radical cations were 
performed overnight at RT by mixing ABTS (0.4 mM final concentration) with potassium persulfate (2.45 mM 
final concentration), kept dark. Prior to usage, ABTS radical solution was dissolved in PBS to an absorbance of ca 
0.7 at 734 nm. To diluted ABTS radical solution (90 μ 
l), 10 μ 
l antioxidant solution (final concentration 0.34–15 μ 
M) 
 
was added, and the absorbance spectrum at 350–950 nm was recorded. Vitamin E was used as a positive control, 
and buffer alone as a negative control.
Degradation of oxy-hemoglobin. 
Oxy-hemoglobin used for incubation with RoxP was purified as 
described elsewhere45 using DEAE Sephadex ion-exchange of erythrocyte hemolysates chromatography accord-
ing to Winterbourn46. Hemoglobin (80 μ 
g/ml final concentration) was added to bacterial supernatants, and incu-
bated at 37 °C, shaking, for 0–5 h. Absorbance spectra at 200–1200 nm were recorded.
Spectrophotometric methods. 
Absorbance spectra was measured on a Beckman DU 640i spectropho-
tometer (Beckman Instruments, CA, US) using a scan rate of 1200 nm/min and protein concentration 10–40 μ 
M. 
Spectrophotometric studies were performed by recording the absorbance with 1–5 min intervals for up to 1 hour 
on a spectrophotometer in the UV-VIS region between 300 and 800 nm.
Ex vivo colonization of P. acnes. 
Subcutaneous fat was excised and removed from human skin from a 
breast reduction. Skin pieces were punched (0.6 cm2), and a silicon sealant (Mepiseal) was applied around the 
edge of each punched explant, to better contain the bacteria on the epidermis. The tissues were placed in Netwells 
that were transferred to 12 well plates and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% glutamax, 
and 10 μ 
g/ml erythromycin for the Δ 
roxP-mutant, at 37 °C, 10% CO2 and 95% humidity. Stationary phase

P. acnes (wildtype and Δ 
roxP-mutant strains) were added in the center on the epidermal side of each biopsy (10  μ 
l, 
 
2 × 
 109 cfu/ml; DMEM as control). The inoculums were allowed to dry in, and colonize the skin during 2 h at 
37 °C. The skin explant was cultured for two weeks, with daily changes of nutrient. Samples were taken for analysis 
at 2 h after inoculation, and 14 days after inoculation. Biopsies were gently washed in PBS to remove any loosely 
adherent bacteria, cut into smaller sizes (e.g. 10 pieces per biopsy) and homogenized by vortexing the samples 
together with glass beads for 2 min at maximum speed. Serial dilutions were made in PBS, and plated in dupli-
cates, incubating anaerobically for up to 11 days before analyzing growth of bacteria. For histological analyses, 
skin pieces were incubated in 5 ml formaldehyde, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 μ 
m sections, 
deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. All experiments related to the ex vivo study 
was conducted by the company Medibiome. No ethical approval was necessary for the work with residual tissues.
Statistical analysis. 
All analyses were calculated with the non-parametric Fisher’s exact test. Only a p-value 
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
