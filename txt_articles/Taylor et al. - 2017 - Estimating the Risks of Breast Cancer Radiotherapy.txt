Purpose
Radiotherapy reduces the absolute risk of breast cancer mortality by a few percentage points in
suitable women but can cause a second cancer or heart disease decades later. We estimated the
absolute long-term risks of modern breast cancer radiotherapy.
Methods
First, a systematic literature review was performed of lung and heart doses in breast cancer
regimens published during 2010 to 2015. Second, individual patient data meta-analyses of 40,781
women randomly assigned to breast cancer radiotherapy versus no radiotherapy in 75 trials yielded
rate ratios (RRs) for second primary cancers and cause-specific mortality and excess RRs (ERRs) per
Gy for incident lung cancer and cardiac mortality. Smoking status was unavailable. Third, the lung or
heart ERRs per Gy in the trials and the 2010 to 2015 doses were combined and applied to current
smoker and nonsmoker lung cancer and cardiac mortality rates in population-based data.
Results
Average doses from 647 regimens published during 2010 to 2015 were 5.7 Gy for whole lung and
4.4 Gy for whole heart. The median year of irradiation was 2010 (interquartile range [IQR], 2008 to
2011). Meta-analyses yielded lung cancer incidence $ 10 years after radiotherapy RR of 2.10 (95%
CI, 1.48 to 2.98; P , .001) on the basis of 134 cancers, indicating 0.11 (95% CI, 0.05 to 0.20) ERR per
Gy whole-lung dose. For cardiac mortality, RR was 1.30 (95% CI, 1.15 to 1.46; P , .001) on the basis
of 1,253 cardiac deaths. Detailed analyses indicated 0.04 (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.06) ERR per Gy whole-
heart dose. Estimated absolute risks from modern radiotherapy were as follows: lung cancer,
approximately 4% for long-term continuing smokers and 0.3% for nonsmokers; and cardiac
mortality, approximately 1% for smokers and 0.3% for nonsmokers.
Conclusion
For long-term smokers, the absolute risks of modern radiotherapy may outweigh the benefits, yet
for most nonsmokers (and ex-smokers), the benefits of radiotherapy far outweigh the risks. Hence,
smoking can determine the net effect of radiotherapy on mortality, but smoking cessation sub-
stantially reduces radiotherapy risk.

INTRODUCTION
Randomized
trials
show
that
radiotherapy
substantially reduces breast cancer recurrence
and moderately reduces absolute breast cancer
mortality by a few percentage points, depending
on cancer characteristics.1,2 For suitable pa-
tients, these benefits outweigh any long-term
risks.3,4
Because most women with early breast
cancer are cured of their disease, the issue of
survivorship is important. Late hazards may be
caused by radiotherapy or systemic therapy. Ta-
moxifen can cause endometrial cancer,5,6 cyto-
toxic drugs can cause leukemia,7 and trastuzumab
and anthracyclines can cause cardiac disease.5,7-9
For breast cancer radiotherapy, the main long-
term hazards are second primary lung cancer and
heart disease.8,10

 The absolute hazards from modern breast cancer radiotherapy
regimens for typical patients depend on the lung and heart doses
from modern regimens, the excess rate ratios (ERRs) per Gy for
lung cancer and heart disease, and future lung cancer and heart
disease mortality rates in the population. Rates of lung cancer and
heart disease in the general population depend strongly on
smoking. Women who smoke throughout adulthood have ap-
proximately 20 times the lung cancer mortality rates and four times
the cardiac mortality rates of nonsmokers.11 Particularly for lung
cancer, therefore, the absolute risks from breast cancer radio-
therapy could be appreciable for smokers, even if they are small for
nonsmokers (because a given proportional increase has less ab-
solute effect on a small risk than on a big risk). Hence, absolute
risks of radiotherapy should be estimated separately for smokers
and nonsmokers.
The objectives of this study were to estimate the main absolute
risks of modern breast cancer radiotherapy. Randomized data on
women with long-term follow-up were used to derive rate ratios
(RRs) for incident second cancers and causes of death before
recurrence of breast cancer and ERRs per Gy for incident pri-
mary lung cancer and cardiac mortality. These ERRs per Gy were
combined with lung and heart doses from modern regimens and
with population-based modern lung cancer and cardiac mortality
rates in smokers and in nonsmokers to estimate the absolute risks
of modern breast cancer radiotherapy.
METHODS
Systematic Review of Worldwide Modern Lung and Heart
Doses
A systematic review of lung and heart doses from recently published
(years 2010 to 2015, any language) breast cancer radiotherapy regimens
was performed (Data Supplement, Methods S2, Reference S1). Mean organ
doses were abstracted (ie, radiation doses averaged across organ volumes).
The unweighted average was calculated for all published mean whole-lung
doses (averaging ipsilateral and contralateral doses) and mean whole-heart
doses. These are termed typical modern doses.
Randomized Trials
Data handling. Data were sought from trials that began before 2000
of radiotherapy versus no radiotherapy or of radiotherapy versus extra
surgery (Table 1) in early breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).
DCIS trials were included because the radiotherapy regimens were similar
to those in some breast cancer trials. Trial identification methods are
available online.3,12 For every woman, information was sought about
patient and tumor characteristics, allocated treatment, time to first re-
currence, time to any contralateral breast cancer or second cancer before
recurrence, and date last known to be alive or date and cause of death.
Information on molecular subtype, smoking, incident cardiac disease, and
lung cancer laterality was unavailable. For lung cancer incidence (after the
first decade) and cardiac mortality, the ERRs per Gy were calculated.
Average doses. Radiotherapy details for each trial were extracted from
publications and protocols. Regimens were reconstructed on one com-
puted tomography scan with typical anatomy using virtual simulation,
three-dimensional computed tomography planning, and sometimes
manual planning (Data Supplement, Methods S1).13 The mean dose to
each organ was calculated for the ipsilateral and contralateral lung; the
esophagus; the whole heart; and the left-anterior-descending, right, and
circumflex coronary arteries. Mean doses were allocated according to trial
regimen and breast cancer laterality. The averages of the lung, heart, and
esophagus trial doses were weighted by trial size. Contralateral breast and
bone marrow doses were not reliably estimable because of exposure
uncertainties for structures several centimeters from the beams.
Statistical methods (RRs and ERRs per Gy). RRs of annual events were
estimated using standard log rank methods. Analyses were stratified by
trial, individual year of follow-up, age at entry, and pathologic nodal status
(Data Supplement, Methods S1). Forest plots illustrate proportional risks,
and actuarial curves illustrate absolute risks. All confidence intervals are
95%. For lung cancer, the ERR per Gy was calculated by dividing (RR 2 1)
by the average trial whole-lung dose, because there were too few events to
use individual patient doses. Smoking status data were unavailable;
therefore, the ERRs were based on all women (smokers and nonsmokers
combined). For cardiac mortality, there were sufficient events to investigate
the ERR per Gy using trial-specific and laterality-specific doses. These were
modeled as a linear function of continuous dose, after assessment for
departure from linearity.
Application of Trial ERRs per Gy and Modern Doses to
Population Mortality Data
To estimate absolute risks for women today, the ERRs per Gy were
multiplied by typical modern lung and heart doses and applied to current
smoker and nonsmoker population mortality rates in 5-year age groups
(Data Supplement, Methods S1). Background rates of death from lung
cancer were taken from nonsmokers in the American Cancer Society
Cancer Prevention Study II14,15 and from smokers in the Million Women
Study in the United Kingdom.11 Background rates of death from is-
chemic heart disease were taken from those (mostly from 2010) in
Western Europe (represented by the original 15 countries of the Eu-
ropean Union).16 These data were also used to estimate the risks for
women irradiated at different ages and the effects of smoking cessation.

 The risk attributable to radiotherapy was taken as the difference in
cumulative risks with the ERR per Gy and dose applied and not applied to
the population-based rates.
RESULTS
Systematic Review of Worldwide Modern Lung and
Heart Doses
A systematic review of all breast cancer radiotherapy do-
simetry reports published during 2010 to 2015 identified 214
reports, including 647 regimens with median year of irradiation
2010 (interquartile range [IQR], 2008 to 2011; Data Supplement,
Methods S2, Reference S1). The averages of the lung doses were as
follows: ipsilateral, 9.0 Gy (IQR, 5.5 to 12.6 Gy), and contralateral,
2.4 Gy (IQR, 0.4 to 3.8 Gy). Averaging the doses to the two lungs,
the typical modern whole-lung dose was 5.7 Gy (IQR, 3.4 to 8.3
Gy).17-19 Average whole-heart doses were as follows: left-sided,
5.2 Gy (IQR, 1.9 to 7.4 Gy), and right-sided, 3.7 Gy (IQR, 1.2 to 5.0
Gy). Averaging these, the typical modern whole-heart dose was 4.4
Gy. Some centers, however, achieved much lower cardiac exposure
and reported a whole-heart dose # 2 Gy, even in left-sided
radiotherapy.20
Randomized Trials
Data handling. Information was available from 75 trials in-
volving 40,781 women (Table 1; Data Supplement Table S3), all evenly
randomized (1:1 or 1:1:1) with median year of randomization of 1983
(IQR, 1974 to 1989) and median age at randomization of 56 years
(IQR, 48 to 64 years). Median follow-up was 10 years (IQR, 5 to 17
years) with 20,345 deaths, 6,064 without breast cancer recurrence. Few
women had systemic therapy: 23% (9,470) received tamoxifen and
19% (7,540) received chemotherapy (mainly cyclophosphamide,
methotrexate, and fluorouracil).
Average doses. In comparison with typical modern doses, lung
and heart doses were higher in the trials: 10 Gy whole lung and 6 Gy
whole heart (Data Supplement Table S1: ipsilateral lung, 17.6 Gy;
contralateral lung, 1.6 Gy; whole lung, 9.6 Gy; whole heart, 6.3 Gy;
left-anterior-descending coronary artery, 13.5 Gy; right coronary
artery, 7.7 Gy; circumflex artery, 4.1 Gy; esophagus in trials with
internal mammary irradiation, 9.5 Gy, and esophagus in other
trials, 0.8 Gy).
RRs and ERRs per Gy. The main risks in the trial were con-
tralateral breast cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, esophageal cancer,
and heart disease (Table 2). There was no significant heterogeneity in
trial-specific RRs. The RR for contralateral breast cancer was 1.20
(95% CI, 1.08 to 1.33; 881 v 673 cancers; P , .001; Table 2, Fig 1,

Estimating Absolute Risks of Modern Breast Cancer Radiotherapy
 Data Supplement Figure S4). Contralateral cancers were not mainly
misclassified recurrences, because incidence was unrelated to nodal
status (Data Supplement Table S5). The contralateral breast cancer RR
was greater in the old trials of orthovoltage (low-energy) radiotherapy
(RR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.99) than in the other trials (RR, 1.12; 95%
CI, 1.00 to 1.26; Data Supplement Figs S4, S5). But in both cases,
contralateral breast radiation doses were not reliably known, so the
contralateral breast cancer ERR per Gy could not be estimated. In the
non-orthovoltage trials, the absolute 15-year increase in contralateral
breast cancer risk was 1.0% (95% CI, 0.2 to 1.8; 7% v 6%; Data
Supplement Fig S5).
Allocation to radiotherapy increased the incidence of primary
lung cancer (Table 2, Data Supplement Figs S7, S9). These cancers
were not mainly misclassified pulmonary metastases, because
their incidence was unrelated to nodal status (Data Supplement
Table S7). There was no significant excess in the first decade after
radiotherapy. Thereafter, there were 94 versus 40 cases (RR, 2.10;
95% CI, 1.48 to 2.98; P , .001; Fig 1), corresponding to 0.11 (95%
CI, 0.05 to 0.20) ERR per Gy.
The incidence RR, radiotherapy versus control, for second
cancers other than breast or lung was 1.19 (95% CI, 1.07 to 1.32;
Data Supplement Fig S10). The main components were leukemia
(RR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.79) and esophageal cancer (RR, 2.42;
95% CI, 1.19 to 4.92, with 30 of the 33 cases occurring in the trials
in which radiotherapy involved the internal mammary chain and
supraclavicular fossa; Table 2). ERRs per Gy were not calculated for
leukemia or esophageal cancer because both CIs were wide and
bone marrow doses were not estimable.
All-cause mortality among women without breast cancer re-
currence was increased by radiotherapy (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.09 to
1.22; Table 2; Data Supplement Figs S1-S3, Table S4), predominantly
because of cardiac disease (RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.46). Most of the
excess cardiac mortality was from ischemic heart disease (RR, 1.31;
95% CI, 1.13 to 1.53; Table 2). However, the main analyses are of all

 cardiac mortality, defined as mortality from all circulatory disease with
the exception of stroke or pulmonary embolism (Data Supplement
Fig S14). Some excess cardiac mortality emerged within 5 years, with
the RR in years 0 to 4 similar to that in years $ 15. However, because
cardiac mortality increases steeply with age, the absolute excess risk
was much greater in the later time period (Data Supplement Figs
S11-S12). The cardiac mortality RR, radiotherapy versus no radio-
therapy, was strongly related to the estimated whole-heart radiation
dose. Analyses that related risk to the trial radiotherapy regimen and to
breast cancer laterality yielded an ERR per Gy of 0.041 (95% CI, 0.024
to 0.062; P , .001; Fig 2).
Application of Trial ERRs per Gy and Modern Doses to
Population Mortality Data
The typical whole-lung dose from modern regimens was
approximately 5 Gy. Combining this with the 0.11 ERR per Gy for
lung cancer . 10 years after radiotherapy and with the population-
based lung cancer rates11,14,15 yielded estimates of lung cancer risks
by age 80 years from typical modern breast cancer regimens
(Fig 3A; Data Supplement Fig S15, Table S9). For a 50-year-old
nonsmoker, a 5-Gy whole-lung dose that increases lung cancer
rates by approximately 55% would increase lung cancer mortality
before age 80 years from approximately 0.5% to 0.8% (ie, an
estimated absolute increase of 0.3%). In contrast, for a 50-year-old
woman who has smoked since adolescence and does not stop,
a 55% increase in the lung cancer mortality rate would change her
risk of death from lung cancer before age 80 years from approxi-
mately 9.4% to 13.8% (an absolute increase of 4.4%). Smoking
cessation at the time of radiotherapy would reduce this estimate of
the radiation-related increase in lung cancer mortality from 4.4% to
1.3% (Data Supplement Table S9).
Lung doses published during 2010 and 2015 varied according

Estimating Absolute Risks of Modern Breast Cancer Radiotherapy
 only one half the typical dose, these absolute excess risks would be
halved, but if it exceeded the typical dose of approximately 5 Gy, the
estimated risks would be correspondingly higher.
The typical whole-heart dose from modern radiotherapy
regimens was approximately 4 Gy. Combining 4 Gy with the 0.041
ERR per Gy for cardiac mortality, cardiac mortality risks from
modern breast cancer radiotherapy were estimated. On the basis of
2010 female death rates in the 15 European Union member states
in Western Europe,16 the estimated risk of death before age 80 years
as a result of heart disease was 1.8% for a nonsmoker and 8.0% for
a smoker.11 If, as this study suggests, a 4-Gy mean heart dose
multiplies these risks by approximately 1.16, then the absolute
increase in cardiac mortality would be 0.3% for a nonsmoker and
1.2% for a smoker (Fig 3B). Whole-heart doses in modern regi-
mens varied widely (IQR for left radiotherapy, 1.9 to 7.4 Gy; IQR
for right radiotherapy, 1.2 to 5.0 Gy). For doses . 4 Gy, the
absolute hazards would be somewhat greater. For cancer centers
reporting whole-heart doses of , 2 Gy, the estimated excess cardiac
mortality would be less than half as great.
DISCUSSION
Breast cancer radiotherapy has changed since these trials, with
a reduction in lung and heart radiation doses. However, the ERRs
per Gy in the past trials remain relevant and can be used to estimate
risks from modern radiotherapy.
For lung cancer, radiotherapy had its main effect . 10 years
later (Fig 1, Data Supplement Figs S6-S7). The lack of any
material early hazard and the substantial hazard during the
second decade in these randomized trials are confirmed by
nonrandomized SEER registry data (Data Supplement Table S8).10
The ERR per Gy in this study is quantitatively consistent
with estimates from published epidemiologic studies, which
together included 334 lung cancers in patients with known
smoking status (Data Supplement Fig S8). Lung cancer is rare
in nonsmokers; only 52 of the 334 cancers in those epide-
miologic studies were in nonsmokers. Although smoking in-
formation was unavailable for women in the trials, our
estimate of the ERR per Gy, as in the epidemiologic studies, will
be based primarily on the findings among smokers; hence it is
likely to be reliable for them. For nonsmokers, even if the ERR
per Gy is not exactly the same as in smokers, their absolute risk
would still be small.
Because quitting smoking greatly reduces lung cancer
incidence,11,15 the estimated absolute increase in lung cancer
mortality from radiotherapy in ex-smokers is likely to be much
closer to that in never-smokers than in current smokers (Data
Supplement Table S9). Even smoking cessation at the time of
radiotherapy should substantially reduce the risk of radiation-
induced lung cancer,11,15 because cessation greatly reduces the

 risk . 10 years later, which is when the main effects of radio-
therapy on lung cancer occur (Data Supplement Table S9).
Therefore, by quitting smoking at the time of radiotherapy,
smokers would reduce their absolute risk of radiation-induced
lung cancer and would achieve a much greater absolute reduction
in other tobacco-attributable risks.11 For smokers irradiated after
age 70 years, radiotherapy would be expected to have no material
effect on lung cancer risk before age 80 years.
Radiotherapy increased contralateral breast cancer as in
nonrandomized studies (Data Supplement Table S6).21-23 In the
trials, the risk was greatest for women who received orthovoltage
radiotherapy (Fig 1), which tends to deliver scattered radiation to
nearby organs24 but is rarely used nowadays. Considering just
the women in non-orthovoltage trials, the absolute radiation-
induced risk of contralateral breast cancer was only approxi-
mately 1%, and many of these cancers could be treated suc-
cessfully. Since these trials, contralateral breast doses have
decreased24-27; moreover, contralateral breast cancer incidence is
reduced by effective systemic therapy.5,6,28 Hence, the absolute
risk of contralateral breast cancer from modern radiotherapy
should be well under 1%, and the risk of death from this late
effect should be smaller still.
Radiotherapy increased esophageal cancer incidence as in
some nonrandomized studies.29-31 Most cases arose in trials in
which the regional lymph nodes were irradiated with fields that
included part of the esophagus. It is now usual to angle fields
away from the esophagus, so the absolute esophageal cancer
risk from modern breast cancer regimens should be very
small.32,33
For cardiac death, the estimated absolute cardiac hazards are
much smaller now than in these trials, because population cardiac
mortality rates are now much lower than they were 30 years ago.
Moreover, the absolute cardiac risks from radiotherapy will con-
tinue to decrease if population heart disease death rates continue to
decrease.
Risks were estimated for typical modern radiotherapy in
typical populations of women. But heart and lung doses in
breast cancer regimens vary, as do population disease rates;
therefore the absolute risks and the effect of smoking cessation
will vary for individual women. The absolute benefits of ra-
diotherapy also vary with cancer characteristics. For women
with invasive cancer, radiotherapy reduces breast cancer
mortality by a few percentage points. For women with DCIS,
the benefit is smaller. The absolute risks from radiotherapy for
some smokers who continue smoking could exceed the absolute
benefit. For example for a 50-year-old long-term smoker with
a small, node-negative breast cancer, her estimated absolute
benefit from radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery is an
approximately 2% to 5% reduction in breast cancer mortality,2
whereas her estimated absolute risks from typical modern
radiotherapy are approximately 4% for lung cancer and ap-
proximately 1% for cardiac mortality if she does not quit
smoking. These findings reinforce the need to limit lung and
heart doses without unduly compromising the dose to the
target tissues, and the need for smokers to stop smoking.
This study has the advantage of being randomized; there-
fore, any definite excesses reflect causality. However, it has some
limitations. Causes of death were not all known, and data on
smoking habits were unavailable. Lung and heart doses were
estimated retrospectively, and (with the exception of laterality)
only trial-level rather than individual-level radiotherapy
information was used. Hence, the estimates of ERRs per Gy
cardiac mortality and lung cancer depend on trial-level doses
(not individual patient doses) being approximately correct.
Lung doses from the trial regimens have not been reported
elsewhere, but the estimated cardiac doses from trial regimens
are similar to other published estimates.13,34-36 Our analyses rely
on the assumption that the risks per Gy lung and heart dose have
not changed over time (ie, that if the doses have halved, the risks
have halved). However, the biologic effects of radiotherapy are
unlikely to have changed over time, and the risks per Gy lung or
heart dose in this study are consistent with other published
estimates for patients irradiated in different decades37 (Data Sup-
plement Fig S8). The proportional increase in cardiac mortality of
0.041 per Gy is somewhat lower than a recent population-based
estimate of a 0.074 per Gy increase in major coronary events,37
but the difference is not statistically significant and the end points
differ.
Information on incident heart disease was unavailable;
therefore, it was not possible to study the relationship between
heart dose and incident heart disease. Any history of heart disease
prior to radiotherapy was also unknown, and it could have sub-
stantially increased the absolute cardiac effects of radiotherapy. Few
women in these trials received anthracyclines, and none received
trastuzumab, so the combined cardiac effects of these cardiotoxic
systemic therapies with radiotherapy could not be assessed.
However, although these systemic therapies can affect the ab-
solute risks of heart disease, they may not materially affect the
ERR per Gy.
For long-term smokers irradiated today, the estimated
combined risks from radiotherapy are a few percentage points if
smoking continues, which may outweigh the reduction in breast
cancer mortality; however, smoking cessation substantially reduces
risk. For healthy nonsmokers, the estimated absolute risks of lung
cancer or cardiac mortality from radiotherapy add up to , 1%,
which, for most women, is much smaller than the benefit from
radiotherapy.1-5
