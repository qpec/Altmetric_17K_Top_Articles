BACKGROUND: Vital sign instability on discharge could
be a clinically objective means of assessing readiness and
safety for discharge; however, the association between
vital sign instability on discharge and post-hospital out-
comes is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between vital sign
instability at hospital discharge and post-discharge ad-
verse outcomes.
DESIGN: Multi-center observational cohort study using
electronic health record data. Abnormalities in tempera-
ture, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and
oxygen saturation were assessed within 24 hours of dis-
charge. We used logistic regression adjusted for predictors
of 30-day death and readmission.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults (≥18 years) with a hospitalization
to any medicine service in 2009–2010 at six hospitals
(safety-net, community, teaching, and non-teaching) in
north Texas.
MAIN MEASURES: Death or non-elective readmission
within 30 days after discharge.
KEY RESULTS: Of 32,835 individuals, 18.7 % were dis-
charged with one or more vital sign instabilities. Overall,
12.8 % of individuals with no instabilities on discharge
died or were readmitted, compared to 16.9 % with one
instability, 21.2 % with two instabilities, and 26.0 % with
three or more instabilities (p < 0.001). The presence of any
(≥1) instability was associated with higher risk-adjusted
odds of either death or readmission (AOR 1.36, 95 % CI
1.26–1.48), and was more strongly associated with death
(AOR 2.31, 95 % CI 1.91–2.79). Individuals with three or
more instabilities had nearly fourfold increased odds of
death (AOR 3.91, 95 % CI 1.69–9.06) and increased odds
of 30-day readmission (AOR 1.36, 95 % 0.81–2.30) com-
pared to individuals with no instabilities. Having two or
more vital sign instabilities at discharge had a positive
predictive value of 22 % and positive likelihood ratio of 1.8
for 30-day death or readmission.
CONCLUSIONS: Vital sign instability on discharge is as-
sociated with increased risk-adjusted rates of 30-day
mortality and readmission. These simple vital sign criteria
could be used to assess safety for discharge, and to reduce
30-day mortality and readmissions.

INTRODUCTION
Over the past 30 years, hospital length of stay has fallen
dramatically, raising concern that many patients may be dis-
charged before being stabilized.1,2 Premature discharge, as in-
dicated by the presence of unresolved clinical instabilities at
discharge, is associated with higher post-discharge mortality
and readmission rates. The landmark RAND studies assessing
the impact of the prospective payment system on Medicare
beneficiaries hospitalized in the 1980s for heart failure, myo-
cardial infarction, pneumonia, stroke, and hip fracture found
that reduced length of stay was accompanied by a 43 % relative
increase in patients being discharged home in a clinically un-
stable state, and that those with at least one clinical instability
had a 60 % relative increase in the risk of death after discharge
compared to those with no instabilities.3,4 Subsequent studies of
patients hospitalized in the 1990s demonstrated that clinical
instability on discharge remained common, and was associated
with higher risk-adjusted odds of death or readmission among
patients hospitalized for pneumonia or hip fracture.5,6
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
public reporting of outcomes and the Hospital Readmission
Reduction Program (HRRP) have both dramatically increased
attention to reducing rates of both 30-day mortality and read-
mission.7–11 Despite intense efforts, attempts at prediction and
prevention of these post-discharge adverse events have had
mixed results.12–15 Assessing the stability of a patient’s vital
signs in the 24 hours prior to discharge is a simple, objective,
and clinically sensible way of determining safety for discharge.

 Recognition and treatment of vital sign instabilities may also
provide an easily actionable target to help providers and hospi-
tals further reduce 30-day post-discharge adverse events. How-
ever, there have been no studies evaluating the association
between vital sign instabilities at discharge and 30-day mortality
and readmission in a general population of adults of all ages
hospitalized for any medical condition, nor has this been exam-
ined in the current era of much shorter hospital stays and
widespread interest in reducing readmissions.
To address this gap in the literature, we used a clinically
granular electronic health record (EHR) dataset of diverse
individuals hospitalized in a variety of settings to assess the
rates and types of vital sign instability among hospitalized
medical patients at discharge, as well as the association be-
tween vital sign instabilities at discharge and 30-day readmis-
sion and mortality even after adjusting for other prognostic
factors. We hypothesized that the presence of vital sign insta-
bility would be associated with increased rates of 30-day
mortality and readmission, and that an increasing number of
instabilities would be associated with higher odds of an ad-
verse post-discharge outcome.
METHODS
Study Design, Population, and Data Sources
We conducted an observational cohort study using EHR data
collected from November 1, 2009, to October 30, 2010, from
six hospitals in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the fourth largest
metroplex in the U.S.16 One site was a major safety-net
hospital; the remaining five community hospitals were a mix
of teaching and non-teaching facilities. All hospitals used the
same EHR system (Epic Systems Corporation, Verona, WI).
We included consecutive hospitalizations among adults
18 years of age or older who were discharged alive from a
medicine inpatient service with any clinical diagnosis. For
individuals who had multiple hospitalizations during this time
period, we included only the first hospitalization. We excluded
individuals who died in the hospital, were transferred to an-
other acute care facility, or who left against medical advice.
We also excluded those discharged to hospice, since these
patients may have desired less aggressive care.
Definition of Vital Sign Instability
Vital sign instabilities were considered present at discharge if
the most abnormal value for a particular vital sign met any of
the following criteria within 24 hours of discharge: tempera-
ture ≥37.8 °C, heart rate ≥100 beats per minute, respiratory
rate >24 breaths per minute, systolic blood pressure
≤90 mmHg, or oxygen saturation <90 %. These cutoffs for
vital sign instability were based on clinical face validity and
previously published studies.5,17 For the <1 % of individuals
missing data within 24 hours of discharge, vital signs were
classified as normal.
Baseline Characteristics
Utilization history, which included emergency department
(ED) visits and hospitalizations in the 12 months preceding
the index hospitalization, was ascertained from both the EHR
and an all-payer regional hospitalization database which cap-
tures ED visits and hospitalizations from 75 acute care hospi-
tals within 100 miles of Dallas.18 Hospital complications were
defined using ICD-9-CM codes from the EHR for secondary
diagnoses for the index hospitalization, and excluded condi-
tions coded during any clinical encounter in the preceding
year. Other baseline characteristics were obtained from the
EHR.
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was a composite of death or readmission
within 30 days of discharge. Readmissions were ascertained at
the index hospital and at any of 75 acute care hospitals in the
region, as described above. Individuals who had both out-
comes (readmission and death) were only counted once in
the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were death and
readmission within 30 days of discharge, considered as inde-
pendent outcomes.
Statistical Analysis
To estimate the independent effect of vital sign instability
on adverse outcomes, we used logistic regression, adjust-
ing for factors identified in a previously validated multi-
condition EHR-based readmission and mortality risk model
that included sociodemographic characteristics, utilization
history, and clinical factors on admission and from the
remainder of the hospitalization (comorbidities, laboratory
abnormalities, hospital complications, etc.).19–29 To assess
a dose–response relationship between an increasing num-
ber of instabilities and adverse outcomes, we used the
Cochran-Armitage test for trend. We accounted for cluster-
ing of patients by hospital using generalized estimating
equations. We assessed whether adverse outcomes among
individuals with vital sign instabilities differed by disposi-
tion status (home, home health, versus post-acute care)
using chi-square tests and logistic regression (with an in-
teraction term for vital sign instability and disposition). We
also assessed whether adverse outcomes among those with
vital sign instabilities differed by whether or not the same
instability was also present on admission, using chi-square
tests. All analyses used Stata version 12.1 software (Stata-
Corp LP, College Station, TX). The UT Southwestern
Medical Center institutional review board approved this
study and waived the requirement for informed consent.
RESULTS
We included a total of 32,835 unique individuals in the study
cohort (Table 1; eFig. 1, Online Appendix). The mean age was
43

JGIM
 62 ± 17 years; over half were women, and individuals were
diverse in race/ethnicity and primary insurance status. Most
individuals had non-elective admissions, no previous ED vis-
its or hospitalizations in the prior year, and had a Charlson
comorbidity index of 0. The overall median length of stay was
4 days (IQR 2–6 days).
Types and Rates of Vital Sign Instabilities on
Discharge
Overall, 6127 individuals (18.7 %) had one or more instabil-
ities on discharge. Elevated heart rate was the most common,
affecting 10.4 % of the study population (Table 2). The fre-
quency of other specific instabilities and combinations of
instabilities is shown in eTable 1 (Online Appendix). Combi-
nations involving elevated temperature had the lowest unad-
justed 30-day composite and mortality rates, but only a small
number of individuals had a combination of instabilities, lim-
iting further analysis. There were no significant differences in
rates of instability on discharge among the six study sites
(range 17.9 %-20.3 %).
Outcomes
In the 30 days after discharge, 4484 (13.7 %) individuals had a
readmission or death. The median time to the composite
outcome was 12 days (IQR 5–20 days). A total of 4163
individuals were readmitted within 30 days (12.7 %), with a
median time to readmission of 11 days (IQR 5–19 days). Only
535 individuals died within 30 days of discharge (1.6 %), with
a median time to death of 16 days (IQR 9–24 days).
Associations Between Vital Sign Instability on
Discharge and Outcomes
Figure 1 shows that the greater the number of instabilities on
discharge, the greater risk of death and/or readmission. Over-
all, 12.8 % of individuals with no instabilities on discharge
died or were readmitted, compared to 16.9 % with one insta-
bility, 21.2 % with two instabilities, and 26.0 % with three or
more instabilities (p < 0.001).
Even after controlling for numerous other prognostic factors
and potential confounders, including demographic, clinical,
and utilization characteristics, we found a dose-dependent
relationship between the number of vital sign instabilities
and odds for 30-day post-discharge adverse events (Table 3;
eTable 2, Online Appendix). The relationship was most strik-
ing for mortality, with the odds of death doubling, tripling, and
quadrupling with each additional instability. Individuals with
any instability on discharge had higher adjusted odds of the
composite outcome (AOR 1.36, 95 % CI 1.26–1.48), death
(AOR 2.36, 95 % CI 1.97–2.83), and readmission (AOR 1.36,
95 % 1.26–1.47) compared to those discharged with stable
vital signs (Table 3).

 Associations Between Instability on Discharge
and Disposition Status
The greater the number of vital sign instabilities an indi-
vidual had on hospital discharge, the more likely they were
to be discharged to a post-acute care facility (which includ-
ed nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities, and long-term
acute care facilities; eFig. 2, Online Appendix). Only
18.1 % of individuals with no instabilities were discharged
to post-acute care, compared to 21.5 % of those with one
instability, 26.7 % of those with two instabilities, and
42.7 % of those with three or more instabilities (p value
<0.001 for trend). Although instability on discharge
remained a significant predictor of death and readmission
irrespective of disposition status, rates of post-discharge
adverse events were uniformly much higher among those
discharged to a post-acute care facility compared to those
discharged home (p value <0.001 for interaction). For those
with two instabilities, 12.3 % of individuals discharged to a
post-acute care facility died and 18.7 % were readmitted
within 30-days, compared to 30-day mortality and read-
mission rates of 1.6 % and 17.1 %, respectively, among
those discharged home (p < 0.001 for both comparisons).
Onset of Vital Sign Instabilities
The proportion of patients with the same instability present on
admission ranged from 38 % for fever to 76 % for tachycardia
(eTable 3, Online Appendix). However, rates of post-
discharge adverse outcomes did not differ by whether the
instability was also present on admission.
Assessment of Instability on Discharge as a
Diagnostic Test for Adverse Events
From a clinical perspective, individual physicians or hospitals
may want to use a specific definition of instability to help gauge
safety and appropriateness of discharge. Thus, vital sign instabil-
ity criteria may be considered a type of diagnostic test for future
adverse events. The test characteristics, including sensitivity,
specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and positive
and negative likelihood ratios, for various cutoffs used to define
instability are displayed in Table 4. A greater number of vital sign
instabilities is more helpful in predicting death within 30 days
(LR+ 3.03, 95 % CI 2.25–4.11 for ≥2 instabilities) than readmis-
sion (LR+ 1.50, 95 % CI 1.26–1.78 for ≥2 instabilities). Howev-
er, the absence of vital sign instability does not necessarily rule
out these outcomes (i.e., LR− range of 0.8–1.0).
DISCUSSION
In this multi-center observational cohort study, with a diverse mix
of community, teaching, and public safety-net hospitals caring for
patients with substantial diversity in age, race/ethnicity, insurance
status and clinical conditions, nearly one in five hospitalized
patients on a medicine service were discharged from the hospital
with one or more vital sign instabilities. Leaving the hospital
before vital signs were clinically stable was associated with
important clinical consequences—the greater the number of vital
sign instabilities, the greater the risk of death or readmission
within 30 days. Individuals with any vital sign instability had
nearly 40 % increased odds of death or readmission within
30 days of discharge, even after adjusting for other important
prognostic factors and potential confounders. Among individuals
with two or more vital signs instabilities, the odds of death

 increased more than threefold. Lastly, patients were more likely
to be sent to post-acute care facilities with an increasing number
of vital sign instabilities at discharge, and experienced much
higher 30-day mortality and readmission rates compared to un-
stable patients discharged home. In other words, discharge to a
post-acute care institution did not diminish the association be-
tween vital sign instabilities and adverse events.
To our knowledge, this is the first study on the effect of vital
sign instabilities on post-discharge adverse outcomes in a general
population of adults hospitalized for any medical condition,
especially in the era of much shorter hospital stays and focus
on reducing readmissions. Our findings confirm and extend the
landmark studies by RAND and Halm et al., which assessed the
effect of more broadly defined clinical instabilities on discharge
in groups with selected conditions in the 1980s and 1990s,
respectively.4,5 Overall, these studies found that 15–19 % of
hospitalized patients had at least one instability on discharge,
and that having any instability was associated with significantly
increased risk of 30-day mortality and readmission. In contrast to
the prior RAND and Halm studies, we deliberately used a more
parsimonious definition of clinical instability based only on vital
signs, because these factors are routinely measured in clinical
practice, are routinely collected in the EHR, are easy to query and
extract electronically, and are simple, common and objective data
routinely used by many providers to assess clinical status and
readiness for discharge. Additionally, unlike many other factors
identified by prediction models as being associated with in-
creased risk for post-discharge adverse outcomes (e.g., prior
utilization), vital sign instabilities provide a direct mechanistic
link between severity and trajectory of illness and subsequent 30-
day adverse outcomes. We also included a broader population of
adults of all ages hospitalized with any medical condition, so our
findings are more generalizable. Nearly 30 years after the initial
RAND study, we found that vital sign instabilities on discharge
remain a prevalent and robust predictor of risk-adjusted 30-day
adverse post-hospital events. Simply put, vital signs are still vital.
Our findings suggest that the presence of one or more vital
sign instabilities should signal that these patients should be
discharged with caution, given that the adjusted odds of death
after discharge more than doubled when a single vital sign
instability was present within 24 hours of discharge. However,
given the modest absolute risk and the substantial proportion of
individuals with one or more instabilities (18.7 % of our pop-
ulation), clinicians should carefully weigh the risks versus
benefits of extending hospitalization in this group and tailor
discharge practices accordingly. The presence of two or more
vital sign instabilities should strongly be considered as objec-
tive criteria to judge readiness for discharge among all medical
inpatients, given that the adjusted odds of death more than
tripled among this small (2.6 % of our population) but high-

 risk group of individuals. However, one limitation is that we do
not know whether extending the hospitalization for individuals
with vital sign instabilities would result in clinical stabiliza-
tion.30,31 Further research is needed to establish whether an
intervention strategy extending the acute care hospital stay for
patients with vital sign instabilities would result in stabilization
and fewer post-discharge adverse events among a broad popu-
lation of hospitalized patients. This will be critical to the ongo-
ing development of objective, evidence-based discharge criteria
to optimize post-discharge patient safety.
Our finding that patients with a greater number of vital sign
instabilities were more likely to be discharged to a post-acute
facility suggests that post-acute care may be perceived as an
acceptable alternate to longer hospitalizations for these sicker
individuals. Several studies of the impact of the Medicare
Inpatient Prospective Payment System (PPS), which created
strong financial incentives to shorten hospital stays, found
increasing rates of discharge to post-acute care after adoption
of PPS.32,33 This practice pattern may have been further rein-
forced by implementation of Medicare’s Hospital Readmission
Reduction Program in 2012, which financially penalizes hos-
pitals for high risk-adjusted readmissions, but specifically
excludes readmissions from post-acute care facilities.3,34–36
However, the higher rates of 30-day post-discharge adverse
events among those discharged to post-acute care facilities with
vital sign instabilities suggests that even with the resources and
closer monitoring typically offered in these settings, post-acute
care facilities may not be equipped to stabilize and treat patients
with vital sign instabilities. Furthermore, an alternate disposi-
tion—either prolonged hospitalization or end-of-life care plan-
ning, given markedly higher mortality rates—may have been
more appropriate for a significant subset of these individuals. A
better understanding of the role of post-acute care for individ-
uals with vital sign instabilities at discharge is needed, and will
become a more pressing issue with anticipated payment reform
measures to encourage greater integration and accountability
for outcomes across the entire spectrum of care.33,37–39
Our study had several strengths. First, our cohort was
diverse with respect to hospital type and patient population.
Second, we were able to use a validated risk-adjustment model
based on detailed, clinically granular information in the EHR
to adjust for numerous other poor prognostic factors, including
sociodemographic characteristics, severity on admission,
comorbid illness burden, utilization, hospital complications,
and physiological trajectory. Third, we included all medical
inpatient admissions, rather than focusing on selected diagno-
ses; thus, our findings may be more generalizable than those of
previous studies.4,5 Fourth, we were also able to ascertain
readmissions within a large geographic region rather than only
within our six-hospital cohort.
Our study had certain limitations. Because this was an
observational study, we cannot unambiguously infer causal-
ity. Findings may be different in other regions with different
hospital discharge practices and post-acute care referral pat-
terns. There may have been some patients who were
discharged home prior to attaining stability because the
patient and/or physician desired intentionally less aggressive
care; however, this was one of the reasons we excluded
individuals discharged to hospice from our analysis. Because
we did not have data on all vital signs in the 24 hours prior
to discharge (only the highest and lowest), it is possible that
some patients may have had one or more sets of normal vital
signs prior to discharge. Nonetheless, our findings suggest
that providers should pay close attention to patients’ vital
signs in the 24 hours prior to contemplating discharge, and
not just the very last set, which may be subject to measure-
ment bias favoring discharge.
CONCLUSIONS
Vital sign instabilities in the 24 hours prior to discharge
are common, and are associated with increased risk-
adjusted rates of 30-day adverse post-discharge events,
particularly death. Discharge guidelines should include
vital sign criteria for judging stability on discharge in
order to improve disposition planning and post-discharge
patient safety. At a minimum, patients with one instability
on discharge should be discharged with caution. Close
outpatient follow-up and appropriate patient education
about warning signs and symptoms that merit urgent med-
ical attention may also be warranted. Individuals with two
or more instabilities should likely remain in the hospital
for continued treatment and observation in the absence of
extenuating circumstances. Though post-acute care facilities
are increasingly providing care for patients discharged with
vital sign instabilities, they may not be optimally equipped to
care for these individuals. Further attention is needed toward
developing evidence-based discharge criteria and interven-
tions to optimize post-discharge patient safety.
