The adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure constitute a continuum of 
disabilities (fetal alcohol spectrum disorders [FASD]). In 1996, the Institute 
of Medicine established diagnostic categories delineating the spectrum 
but not specifying clinical criteria by which diagnoses could be assigned. 
In 2005, the authors published practical guidelines operationalizing the 
Institute of Medicine categories, allowing for standardization of FASD 
diagnoses in clinical settings. The purpose of the current report is to present 
updated diagnostic guidelines based on a thorough review of the literature 
and the authors’
 combined expertise based on the evaluation of >10 
000 
children for potential FASD in clinical settings and in epidemiologic studies 
in conjunction with National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism–
funded studies, the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum 
Disorders, and the Collaboration on FASD Prevalence. The guidelines 
were formulated through conference calls and meetings held at National 
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism offices in Rockville, MD. Specific 
areas addressed include the following: precise definition of documented 
prenatal alcohol exposure; neurobehavioral criteria for diagnosis of fetal 
alcohol syndrome, partial fetal alcohol syndrome, and alcohol-related 
neurodevelopmental disorder; revised diagnostic criteria for alcohol-
related birth defects; an updated comprehensive research dysmorphology 
scoring system; and a new lip/philtrum guide for the white population, 
incorporating a 45-degree view. The guidelines reflect consensus among 
a large and experienced cadre of FASD investigators in the fields of 
dysmorphology, epidemiology, neurology, psychology, developmental/
behavioral pediatrics, and educational diagnostics. Their improved clarity 
and specificity will guide clinicians in accurate diagnosis of infants and 
children prenatally exposed to alcohol.

Medicine (IOM) described 4 distinct 
diagnostic categories within FASD: FAS, 
partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS), 
alcohol-related neurodevelopmental 
disorder (ARND), and alcohol-related 
birth defects (ARBD). 
3 However, the 
task force did not specify the clinical 
process by which individual children 
could be assigned to the groups. Since 
that time, a number of diagnostic 
systems have been proposed.4 
 
 
 
– 
10 In 
2005, Hoyme et al 
4 described specific 
clinical guidelines that allowed for 
assigning diagnoses within the 1996 
IOM classification.
Subsequently, the authors have 
evaluated >10 
000 children for 
potential FASD in clinical settings 
and epidemiologic studies as part of 
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse 
and Alcoholism (NIAAA) supported 
studies, the Collaborative Initiative 
on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders 
(CIFASD), and the Collaboration on 
FASD Prevalence (CoFASP). CIFASD 
was established by NIAAA in 2003 to 
investigate data-driven methods for 
complete diagnosis of the continuum 
of FASD, prevention of the adverse 
effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, 
and effective interventions for 
affected individuals. 
11, 
 
12 CoFASP 
seeks to establish the prevalence of 
FASD among school-age children 
in US communities by using active 
case ascertainment methodology. 
12 
Based on this broad multidisciplinary 
experience, the purpose of this 
special article is to propose updated 
clinical guidelines for diagnosing 
FASD that clarify and expand on 
the original 2005 guidelines. These 
updated diagnostic criteria have been 
formulated, reviewed, and accepted 
by the investigators and collaborating 
sites of CoFASP and the administrative 
core of CIFASD. They do not 
necessarily represent the policy of the 
American Academy of Pediatrics.
BACKGROUND AND SCOPE OF THE 
PROBLEM
FASDs are the leading cause 
of preventable developmental 
disabilities in the world. Recent 
school-based studies in the United 
States estimate the prevalence 
of FASD to be much higher than 
previously thought. May et al 
13 
recently recorded combined rates 
of FAS and PFAS of 10.9 to 25.2 
per 1000 (1.1%–2.5%) in a Rocky 
Mountain community, whereas 
the complete continuum of FASD 
(including ARND) was observed to be 
24 to 48 per 1000 (2.4%–4.8%) in a 
community in the Northern Plains. 
14 
In the mixed race population of the 
Western Cape Province in South 
Africa, the highest prevalence rates 
of FASD in the world have been 
documented, 135.1 to 207.5 per 1000 
(13.5%–20.8%). 
15 The World Health 
Organization (WHO) is currently 
planning prevalence studies in 
several countries in Europe, Asia, 
Africa, and North America, which 
should lead to global data about 
the frequency of this continuum of 
disabilities. 
16
The high prevalence of FASD 
produces an immense burden to 
society in financial terms, unrealized 
productivity, and human suffering. 
In the United States, annual cost 
estimates have ranged from $74.6 
million in 1984 
17 to $4.0 billion in 
1998. 
18 In 2007, the estimated annual 
cost of FASD in Canada was CAD $5.3 
billion. 
19
The soaring prevalence and burden 
of FASD in children recently led the 
American Academy of Pediatrics to 
stress the following: no amount of 
alcohol intake during pregnancy can 
be considered safe; there is no safe 
trimester to drink alcohol; all forms 
of alcohol pose a similar risk; and 
binge drinking poses a dose-related 
risk to the fetus. 
20
PREPARATION OF UPDATED 
DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINES
These guidelines were formulated 
by the authors over a 12-month 
period, through a series of 
conference calls and face-to-face 
meetings at the offices of NIAAA 
in Rockville, MD. The following 
working subgroups of investigators 
were organized to revisit diagnostic 
criteria: dysmorphology evaluation, 
neurobehavioral assessment, and 
definition of significant documented 
prenatal alcohol exposure. 
Recommendations from the working 
committees were brought back to 
the larger group for discussion and 
revision. The guidelines presented 
herein are the result of a thorough 
review of the literature and the 
longstanding collective expertise 
of the authors. The updated clinical 
guidelines for diagnosis of FASD are 
set forth in  
Table 1.
APPLICATION OF THE GUIDELINES IN 
THE DIAGNOSIS OF FASD
An FASD diagnostic algorithm 
incorporating the updated diagnostic 
guidelines is depicted in  
Fig 1.
Optimal Diagnostic Setting and the 
Role of the Pediatrician
Assignment of an FASD diagnosis 
is a complex medical diagnostic 
process best accomplished through 
a structured multidisciplinary 
approach by a clinical team 
comprising members with varied 
but complementary experience, 
qualifications, and skills. The 
assessment of individuals prenatally 
exposed to alcohol requires a medical 
assessment and team leadership by 
a pediatrician or clinical geneticist/
dysmorphologist with expertise in 
the full range of human malformation 
syndromes and the dysmorphology 
evaluation of children with FASD. 
In addition, exposed children 
should have expert psychological/
neuropsychological assessment, 
and a skilled interviewer should 
evaluate prenatal maternal alcohol 
intake. Other team members may 
include developmental behavioral 
pediatricians, psychiatrists, speech 
pathologists, occupational therapists, 
physical therapists, special

ptosis, retinal vascular anomalies, optic nerve hypoplasia; ears: conductive hearing loss, neurosensory hearing loss
Diagnostic Caveats: The assignment of an FASD is a complex medical diagnostic process best accomplished through a multidisciplinary approach. As is the case with many medical 
conditions, sound clinical judgment must be used. Differential diagnoses should always include genetic disorders or conditions arising from other teratogens. Additionally, because head 
circumference, growth, and many cognitive and behavioral characteristics have moderate to high degrees of heritability, when information is available about the biological parents, these 
data should be considered in the fi
 nal diagnostic decision.
a Adaptive skills should be assessed, but such defi
 cits cannot stand alone for diagnosis.

The essential role of the pediatrician 
in the identification and care of 
children with FASD cannot be 
overstated. Pediatricians are 
among the most likely practitioners 
to first encounter children with 
prenatal alcohol exposure who are 
potentially at risk for FASD. Jones 
et al 
24 demonstrated the accuracy 
of pediatricians in recognizing FAS 
on the basis of physical and other 
common associated features after a 
relatively short training session. In 
addition, once a diagnosis is 
assigned, pediatricians are called 
on to provide a medical home for 
affected children, coordinate mental 
health services, and manage other 
comorbid mental health disorders. 
Pediatricians also play an important 
role in the prevention of future 
alcohol-exposed pregnancies through 
counseling women with affected 
children. 
25
Documentation of Signifi
 cant 
Prenatal Alcohol Exposure
Assessment of maternal prenatal 
alcohol intake is an essential part 
of the diagnostic process and is 
the first step in the diagnostic 
algorithm outlined in  
Fig 1. It 
is best measured by quantity of 
alcohol consumed per occasion 
(standard drinks per drinking day), 
frequency that it is consumed (eg, 
daily, times per week), and timing 
during gestation, because timing 
of significant exposure (even in 
the early weeks of pregnancy) can 
produce different physical and 
neurobehavioral phenotypes. 
26 
 
– 
30 
Binge drinking (3–5 drinks or more 
per occasion) has been shown 
in animal and human studies to 
be the most detrimental to fetal 
development. 
26, 
 
31 Asking about 
use of other potential teratogens 
during pregnancy is also important 
because, in addition to their own 
potential teratogenicity, women 
who abuse drugs are more likely to 
use alcohol during pregnancy. 
13, 
14, 
 
32 
Because in many populations it is 
likely that prenatal alcohol use will be 
denied completely or be significantly 
underreported, 
 
13, 
 
14, 
 
33– 
35 biomarkers 
can assist in documenting prenatal 
alcohol exposure. Most frequently, 
alcohol exposure information is 
collected retrospectively. It is 
well documented that accurate 
information on a particular 
pregnancy can be obtained from 
a willing respondent years after 
the birth of a child 
36 
– 
38 or from the 
medical or social service records or 
a collateral informant (eg, spouse, 
close relative, or friend) who had 
regular contact with the mother 
during pregnancy.15, 
 
26
In maternal interviews, because of 
potential stigmatization associated 
with prenatal alcohol use, and 
for accuracy, questions should 
be asked in a timeline followback 
manner, 
 
39, 
 
40 progressing from the 
broader context of health history 
(childbearing, general illness, 
nutrition, and dietary intake 
26, 
 
41, 
42) 
to the more sensitive alcohol use 
questions. It is important to also 
consider the overall drinking pattern 
immediately before pregnancy 
recognition, as it is common for the 
drinking pattern of 3 months before 
pregnancy to persist into early 
pregnancy. 
13, 
 
14, 
 
43 
 
 
 
– 
49
A consensus definition of significant 
prenatal alcohol exposure is set 
forth in  
Table 2. Note that although 
certain circumstances permit the 
diagnosis of FAS or PFAS without 
firm documentation of gestational 
alcohol use ( 
Table 1), positive 
confirmation of alcohol exposure 
must be available for the 
diagnosis of ARND or ARBD to 
be assigned.
Dysmorphology Evaluation
After assessing prenatal alcohol 
exposure, the presence or absence 
of the characteristic structural 
features of FASD must be 
evaluated. For the dysmorphology 
examination, height, weight, and 
head circumference should first 
be measured and plotted by using 
population-specific growth curves. 
In the United States, the authors 
advise following the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) recommendations: use the 
5
TABLE 2  
Defi
 nition of Documented Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (as Applied to the Diagnostic Categories Set Forth in  
Table 1)
One or more of the following conditions must be met to constitute documented prenatal alcohol exposure during pregnancy (including drinking levels reported 
by the mother 3 mo before her report of pregnancy recognition or a positive pregnancy test documented in the medical record). The information must be 
obtained from the biological mother or a reliable collateral source (eg, family member, social service agency, or medical record):
− ≥6 drinks/wk for ≥2 wk during pregnancya
− ≥3 drinks per occasion on ≥2 occasions during pregnancya
− Documentation of alcohol-related social or legal problems in proximity to (before or during) the index pregnancy (eg, history of citation[s] for driving while 
intoxicated or history of treatment of an alcohol-related condition)
− Documentation of intoxication during pregnancy by blood, breath, or urine alcohol content testing
− Positive testing with established alcohol-exposure biomarker(s) during pregnancy or at birth (eg, analysis of fatty acid ethyl esters, phosphatidylethanol, and/
or ethyl glucuronide in maternal hair, fi
 ngernails, urine, or blood, or placenta, or meconium) 
50 
– 
55
− Increased prenatal risk associated with drinking during pregnancy as assessed by a validated screening tool of, for example, T-ACE (tolerance, annoyance, cut 
down, eye-opener) or AUDIT (alcohol use disorders identifi
 cation test) 
56
Assignment of documented prenatal alcohol exposure to any individual case requires the sound judgment of an experienced clinician.
a These criteria for maternal drinking are based on large epidemiologic studies that demonstrate adverse fetal effects from ≥3 drinks per occasion 
26, 
 
57 and others that indicate 1 drink/
day as a threshold measure for FASD.

WHO growth charts for children 
from birth to 2 years to assess 
height and weight. (The WHO 
growth standards for children 
younger than 2 years have been 
adapted for use in the United 
States.) Use the CDC growth 
charts for children and teenagers 
aged 2 to 19 years. 
61 In other 
countries, we recommend using 
more-specific population-normed 
charts, if available. If growth curves 
specific to the population studied 
are not available, we endorse the 
recommendations of the CDC for 
US children. 
61 Prenatal growth 
restriction can be determined 
from reference data published by 
Oken et al 
62 by gestational age. 
In these diagnostic guidelines, 
we define growth deficiency as 
≤10th centile. 
4, 
8 Prenatal growth 
restriction should be exhibited, 
or a pattern of postnatal growth 
deficiency should be documented 
if possible (decreased height and/
or weight on >1 occasion over 12 
months, and unrelated to postnatal 
environmental deprivation). With 
respect to determination of head 
circumference centiles, we have 
used the head circumference 
growth charts from Nellhaus 
63 in all 
populations, in lieu of more-specific 
population-based norms. For the 
purposes of these guidelines, a 
small head circumference is defined 
as ≤10th centile. 
4,

The presence or absence of the 
3 cardinal facial characteristics 
of FASD must next be objectively 
assessed: short palpebral fissures, 
smooth philtrum, and thin vermilion 
border of the upper lip ( 
Fig 2). 
Although other investigators have 
advocated for measurement of facial 
anthropometry from 2-dimensional 
photography, we feel that direct 
examinations are more practical 
in an office setting. Here we define 
short palpebral fissures as ≤10th 
centile. 
4, 
 
8 Palpebral fissure length 
centiles can be estimated from a 
number of published norms; we 
have used the curves derived from 
direct examination of children 
published by Thomas et al. 
64 If facial 
anthropometry is measured live, 
palpebral fissure norms derived 
from live examinations must be 
used. (If palpebral fissure lengths 
are measured from photographs, 
published norms obtained from 
2-dimensional photography are 
available.65) Similar to the experience 
of the authors, Avner et al 
66 found 
palpebral fissure lengths measured 
from photographs to be consistently 
smaller than those measured live. 
Similarly, Astley 
67 found the norm 
for palpebral fissures measured from 
2-dimensional photographic software 
to fall 1.6 SDs below the mean on a 
palpebral fissure chart derived from 
live examinations.  
Figure 3 A and 
B depicts the technique for direct 
measurement of palpebral fissure 
length, and  
Fig 3C demonstrates why, 
in our experience, 2-dimensional 
photographic assessment of 
palpebral fissure length is prone to 
inaccuracy because of individual 
variation in the zygomatic angle that 
cannot be corrected for by a single 
mathematical adjustment. However, 
it should be noted that investigators 
disagree on the method that results 
in the most accurate measurement 
of palpebral fissure length.67 
– 
69 The 
morphology of the philtrum and the 
vermilion border of the upper lip are 
objectively scored by comparison 
with a racially normed lip/philtrum 
guide ( 
Fig 4). 
70, 
71 Scores of 4 or 5 
are consistent with the effects of 
prenatal alcohol exposure. If 2 of the 
3 cardinal facial characteristics are 
present (short palpebral fissures, 
smooth philtrum, and/or thin 
vermilion border of the upper lip) the 
child is classified as having a positive 
dysmorphology facial evaluation for 
FASD.
Neurodevelopmental Assessment 
and Neuropsychology Evaluation
Because the primary manifestations 
of the teratogenic effects of alcohol 
are demonstrated by changes in 
brain structure and/or function, 
comprehensive neurodevelopmental 
assessment is essential. Although the 
dysmorphology assessment of infants 
and small children for the growth 
and facial characteristics of FASD is 
feasible, a comprehensive cognitive/
developmental evaluation may not 
be possible by using conventional 
assessment tools until after age 
3 years. 
72 However, the cognitive 
and neurobehavioral phenotype of 
affected children evolves predictably 
over time 
73 
 
–76 and can be correlated

with areas of brain vulnerability 
( 
Table 3).
The authors promote the use 
of standardized tests that were 
developed by using normative 
groups that are representative of the 
population being tested. Therefore, 
in the updated guidelines, ≥1.5 SD 
below the mean refers to the mean 
of the normative group on which the 
tests were standardized. Therefore, 
both groups (alcohol-exposed 
children as well as unexposed 
children) are tested by using the same 
well-normed testing battery, thereby 
making the comparisons appropriate.
Multidisciplinary Case Conference
Once the prenatal exposure history, 
dysmorphology assessment, and 
neuropsychological testing have 
been obtained, a multidisciplinary 
case conference offers the best 
opportunity for full discussion of the 
case before assignment of an FASD or 
other diagnosis ( 
Fig 1).
Phenocopies of FASD
Clinicians should be aware that the 
facial phenotype of FAS, although 
most commonly associated with 
prenatal alcohol exposure, is also 
observed in a variety of genetic and 
teratogenic conditions ( 
Table 4). 
Therefore, physicians should use a 
low threshold for ordering additional 
genetic testing of children with 
potential FASD. A chromosome 
microarray has been shown to be the 
highest-yield diagnostic test when a 
genetic phenocopy of FASD is being 
considered.

DISCUSSION
In the decade since the original 
operationalized IOM diagnostic 
criteria 
4 were published, extensive 
international research on the 
teratogenic effects of alcohol and the 
authors’
 broad clinical experience 
have allowed for the development 
of further clarity and specificity in 
the diagnostic guidelines presented 
in this article. However, it should be 
noted that agreement on a universal 
diagnostic system for FASD is lacking 
among investigators in the field of 
FASD, especially concerning some 
of the features of the diagnostic 
guidelines set forth in  
Table 1. A 
discussion of the debated elements 
follows.
Diagnostic Categories Within the 
Continuum of FASD
It is the authors’
 assertion that the 4 
original IOM diagnostic categories 
3 
within the continuum of FASD 
remain the most apt descriptors of 
the range of disabilities observed. 
These longstanding categories 
have heretofore been accepted by 
many of the diagnostic systems, 
 
4, 
 
8, 
 
9 
and we see no need to introduce 
additional confusion into a field 
in which diagnostic consensus is 
critical. In addition, classification 
of individuals into 1 of the existing 
specific IOM categories allows for 
determination of prognosis and 
treatment planning. We also assert 
that the category of ARBDs, although 
uncommon, remains necessary, 
especially in epidemiologic 
studies.82, 
 
83 Our extensive database 
of alcohol-exposed children reveals 
many examples of affected children 
not fitting into 1 of the other 
categories who display 1 of the 
major malformations set forth in 
 
Table 1 and whose mothers binged 
during the embryonic stage critical 
to the developmental pathology of 
the malformation.
It should be noted that the Canadian 
diagnostic guideline for FASD 
recently was updated, collapsing 
the diagnostic categories under the 
diagnosis of “fetal alcohol spectrum 
disorder” to 2: FASD with sentinel 
facial features and FASD without

 ssure length. A small plastic ruler is used to measure the distance between the endocanthion (where the eyelids 
meet medially) and the exocanthion (where the eyelids meet laterally). Subject and examiner should be seated at the same level opposite from one 
another. Keeping the chin level, the subject is asked to look up, allowing the examiner to bring the ruler as close to the eye as possible (without touching 
the lashes). The ruler can be rested on the cheek for stability while recording the measurement. B, Note that the ruler is angled slightly to follow the 
curve of the zygoma. C, The correct length of the palpebral fi
 ssure is depicted here as measurement “C.” This highlights the diffi
 culty of 2-dimensional 
photographic measurement, because “B” is highly variable among individuals, leading to differences in the zygomatic angle (the angle between line 
segments B and C).

sentinel facial features. 
10 Whether 
this simplified diagnostic scheme 
will result in practical improvements 
in the clinical care of affected 
individuals and more accurate 
epidemiologic studies estimating the 
prevalence of FASD remains to be 
demonstrated.
Sensitivity Versus Specifi
 city in 
Clinical Diagnosis
Similar to others, our goals in the 
formulation of FASD diagnostic 
guidelines have been improved 
sensitivity and greater inclusion of 
children in the complete continuum 
of FASD 
4, 
 
8; thus, we have set cutoff 
levels for growth deficiency, head 
circumference, and palpebral 
fissure length at ≤10th centile and 
required 2, rather than 3, cardinal 
facial features for a diagnosis 
of FAS and PFAS. Because we 
advocate for a structured expert-
led multidisciplinary diagnostic 
approach to the diagnosis of FASD, 
casting a broad net early in the 
diagnostic process and later using the 
case conference to carefully assign 
diagnoses has been our standard. 
Other diagnostic systems advocate 
for more stringent cutoffs: growth 
deficiency, head circumference, 
and palpebral fissure length less 
than or equal to the third centile 
and requiring all 3 of the cardinal 
facial features for alcohol-related 
diagnoses. 
5, 
 
9, 
10 Sensitivity and 
specificity are 2 sides of a diagnostic 
coin. Theoretically, the guidelines 
presented here demonstrating 
increased sensitivity could lead to 
overdiagnosis; thus, our advocacy for 
a structured expert multidisciplinary 
approach. On the other hand, 
strict diagnostic cutoffs associated 
with increased specificity could 
lead to underdiagnosis of affected 
children. Children with FASD 
are subject to a host of societal, 
educational, health, and judicial 
problems, all of which are affected 
by the time of diagnosis. 
84, 
 
85 Because 
early diagnosis and initiation of 
intervention should be of paramount

importance, the authors assert that 
improved, sensitive, and inclusive 
diagnostic criteria for FASD should 
continue to be imperatives in the 
diagnostic process.
Defi
 cient Brain Growth, Abnormal 
Morphogenesis, or Abnormal 
Neurophysiology
In the updated criteria, we have 
added documentation of recurrent 
nonfebrile seizures to the potential 
assignment of children to the 
diagnostic categories of FAS or PFAS. 
A child with FAS must now exhibit 
deficient brain growth, structure, or 
neurophysiology. This modification 
was prompted by a growing body of 
research that indicates that epilepsy 
is a frequent accompaniment of 
FASD. 
86, 
 
87 More commonly observed 
in children with FASD, a small head 
circumference is a reliable, easily 
obtained proxy for decreased brain 
volume. 
88, 
 
89 Finally, a number of 
structural brain anomalies have 
been observed in imaging studies 
in animals and human subjects with 
FASD. Although no specific anatomic 
region of the brain is preferentially 
affected, malformations resulting 
from migration abnormalities, 
changes in size and shape of the 
corpus callosum, cerebellar vermis 
hypoplasia, and hypoplasia of the 
basal ganglia and hippocampus have 
been documented.90, 
 
91
The 4-digit diagnostic code 
5 assesses 
these features as “structural evidence 
of central nervous system damage, 
” 
and the updated Canadian guideline 
for diagnosis of FASD 
10 includes 
a similar category (abnormal 
neuroanatomy/neurophysiology) as 
1 of the 10 central nervous system 
domains that may be impaired, 
although this category is not a 
universal part of other diagnostic 
systems. 
6 
–8
Other Minor Anomalies in Children 
With FASD
In dysmorphology, clinical diagnoses 
are based on recognizable patterns of 
major and minor anomalies. Although 
the dysmorphology contribution 
to FASD diagnoses is derived from 
objective evaluation of the face, a 
number of other minor anomalies 
have been observed consistently 
and more commonly in children 
prenatally exposed to alcohol than in 
nonexposed controls. 
4, 
 
13, 
 
14, 
 
92, 
93 The 
clinical assessment of the presence or 
absence of these features should be 
part of the dysmorphology evaluation 
of children with potential FASD. The 
overall dysmorphic variation in any 
individual child can be quantified 
by calculation of a dysmorphology 
score (an updated dysmorphology 
scoring system based on objective 
observations of growth and minor 
anomalies in 370 children with 
FAS is presented in  
Table 5). The 
dysmorphology score allows for 
objective comparison among groups 
of children with FASD and has proven 
to be a valuable research tool. It is 
also a useful instrument to review 
as part of the differential diagnostic 
process when assessing features 
of genetic or other teratogenic 
disorders that may mimic FASD 
( 
Table 4). The score has been 
observed to correlate significantly 
with prenatal maternal alcohol 
intake, as well as with the cognitive 
and neurobehavioral characteristics 
of the affected child. 
26, 
 
94
Specifi
 city of Neurobehavioral 
Impairment
The updated guidelines now require 
that all children assigned FASD 
diagnoses (with the exception of 
those with ARBD) must display 
neurobehavioral impairment 
(cognitive impairment or behavioral 
impairment without cognitive 
impairment). The original guidelines 
allowed for children with the 
requisite facial features, growth 
restriction, and/or microcephaly 
to be assigned an FASD diagnosis 
in the absence of significant 
neurobehavioral impairment. 
However, because neurocognitive 
impairment and abnormal behavior 
are the principal sources of disability 
in FASD, assignment of children 
with prenatal alcohol exposure 
into an FASD category without 
neurobehavioral impairment has no 
practical utility for either the child or 
the child’
s family.
The definition of neurobehavioral 
impairment in FASD has become more 
specific over the past decade. 
36, 
 
72 
 
– 
76 
The original 1996 IOM criteria 
and the 2005 guidelines defined 
neurobehavioral impairment as 
“evidence of a complex pattern of 
behavioral or cognitive abnormalities 
inconsistent with developmental 
level that cannot be explained 
by genetic predisposition, family 
background, or environment alone.” 
3, 
 
4 
Although the 2005 criteria outlined 
areas of marked neurobehavioral 
impairment, levels of deficit and 
affected functional domains were not 
clearly articulated. The guidelines 
set forth in  
Table 1 clearly delineate 
domains of functioning to be assessed 
and levels of deficit to be reached to 
meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS, 
PFAS, and ARND.
The domains of function outlined 
in the updated criteria encompass 
the following: (1) global intellectual 
ability (full-scale, verbal, 
performance, or spatial IQ), (2) 
cognition (executive functioning, 
learning, memory, and visual-
spatial skills), (3) behavior and 
self-regulation (mood, behavioral 
regulation, attention, and impulse 
control), and (4) adaptive skills.

These functional domains were 
selected based on the empirical 
evidence of deficits in children 
prenatally exposed to alcohol and/or 
who have been given a diagnosis of 
FASD.

For children >3 years of age, 
diagnoses of FAS or PFAS require 
evidence of global cognitive 
impairment (reflected in a deficit 
of ≥1.5 SDs below the mean on a 
measure of global intelligence [full-
scale IQ score] or performance, 
verbal, or visual/spatial IQ) or 
evidence of behavioral deficit ≥1.5 
SDs below the mean in ≥1 domain in 
impairments of self-regulation (mood 
or behavioral regulation impairment, 
attention deficit, or impulse control).
A diagnosis of ARND can be made 
only if there is confirmed prenatal 
alcohol exposure and global 
cognitive impairment, reflected 
in a deficit of ≥1.5 SDs below 
the mean on a measure of global 
intelligence (full-scale IQ score) 
or performance, verbal, or visual/
spatial IQ. If cognitive impairment 
is not present (often the case with 
individuals prenatally exposed to 
alcohol), cognitive deficits in at 
least 2 additional neurobehavioral 
domains (executive functioning, 
specific learning, memory, or visual-
spatial) are required at ≥1.5 SDs 
below the mean. Additionally, the 
new guidelines provide for an ARND 
diagnosis based on behavioral 
impairment without cognitive 
impairment, as evidenced by deficits 
at ≥1.5 SDs below the mean in at 
least 2 behavioral domains: mood 
or behavioral regulation, attention 
deficit, or impulse control. Adaptive 
skills also should be assessed. 
108 
– 
110 
The adaptive scores can be used to 
assist with the diagnosis; however, 
specific cutoffs and adaptive behavior 
requirements are not included in the 
diagnostic criteria.
For children who are ≤3 years of 
age, a diagnosis of FAS and PFAS 
can be made if there is evidence of 
developmental delay ≥1.5 SDs below 
the mean on a standardized measure 
of developmental trajectory. However, 
for ARND, a definitive diagnosis 
cannot be made before 3 years of age.
The neurobehavioral criteria 
for diagnoses within the FASD 
continuum differ from those 
proposed by other investigators 
5, 
 
9, 
 
10 
(our guidelines require: cutoffs 
of –1.5 SDs rather than –2 SDs, for 
neurobehavioral assessment and 
less stringent neurobehavioral 
criteria for those affected 
children who demonstrate the 
requisite dysmorphology allowing 
classification into the categories 
of FAS and PFAS). Our previously 
published data confirm that because 
the dysmorphology score has the 
highest correlation with confirmed 
diagnoses in the FASD continuum, 
confidence in an FAS or PFAS 
diagnosis can be ensured with 
impairment in fewer neurobehavioral 
domains. 
26, 
94
Differentiation Between ARND and 
Neurobehavioral Disorder With 
Prenatal Alcohol Exposure
These updated criteria continue 
to include ARND as a necessary 
diagnostic category. With the 
introduction of Neurobehavioral 
Disorder with Prenatal Alcohol 
Exposure (ND-PAE) into the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition 
as a “condition in need of further 
study, 
” 
7 there has been significant 
confusion about the necessity of 
retaining both ARND and ND-PAE as 
diagnostic entities. To be clear, ARND 
is a complex medical diagnosis, best 
assigned as part of a multidisciplinary 
team evaluation for FASD. It has 
been widely applied in epidemiologic 
studies 
14, 
 
93 and in clinical settings and 
has been found to accurately describe 
the end of the continuum of FASD 
without dysmorphology. 
111,

contrast, ND-PAE is an experimental 
mental health diagnostic code that 
is intended to be used in clinical 
settings by clinicians from a variety

of theoretical orientations, including 
psychiatrists (and other physicians), 
psychologists, social workers, nurses, 
occupational and rehabilitation 
therapists, and counselors. This 
code triggers payment for services 
related to the condition as well as 
helps individuals access needed 
interventions and treatments. 
113 
According to the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
Fifth Edition, ND-PAE requires ≥1 
deficits in neurocognition and in 
self-regulation plus ≥2 deficits 
in adaptive functioning (with at 
least 1 in communication or social 
communication and interaction). 
99, 
 
114 
An ARND diagnosis can be made 
based on global cognitive deficits 
alone without the behavioral issues 
that fall into the psychiatric realm. 
ARND also can be diagnosed if there 
is evidence of behavioral deficits in 
at least 2 behavioral domains in the 
absence of cognitive deficits. Whether 
in the long run they will merge into a 
single entity will depend on further 
study and refinement of both ARND 
and ND-PAE as they are applied in 
practice.
Future Directions
The guidelines presented here are 
based on the most recent FASD 
research and clinical data. However, 
their accuracy will need to be 
reevaluated over time as their validity 
is more extensively assessed. Among

The Revised Dysmorphology Score was derived from analysis of growth and structural data from 370 children with 
full-blown FAS. The subjects were among the international cohort of children examined by the dysmorphology experts 
(HEH, MAM, LKR, MPA, OAR, TJ, KLJ) involved in NIAAA-supported CIFASD and CoFASP studies. The children were examined 
blindly by the investigators as part of school-based epidemiology studies of children in grade 1 (ages 5–8). Interexaminer 
agreement on anthropometric measures was high (Cronbach’s α scores ranged from 0.975 to 0.855 for craniofacial 
assessment items).
The cardinal diagnostic features (small head circumference, growth restriction [height and weight combined], short 
palpebral fi
 ssures, smooth philtrum, and thin vermilion border of the upper lip) were assigned a score of 3. Other features 
observed in ≥100 children were assigned a score of 2. Features observed in <100 children received a score of 1. The score 
provides an objective method of quantifying dysmorphic features and comparing the structural phenotype of FASD among 
affected children; it is not used in assigning FASD diagnoses. However, compilation of the minor anomalies cataloged in the 
score is useful in differentiating children with FASD from genetic and teratogenic phenocopies ( 
Table 5).
This supplants the original scoring system that was based on the authors’ subjective analysis of the frequency of minor 
anomalies associated with FASD.

and a more precise definition of 
what constitutes minimal criteria for 
adverse fetal alcohol exposure during 
gestation. Finally, other diagnostic 
approaches to FASD that can be 
readily applied in resource-poor 
settings should be explored.
CONCLUSIONS
FASD continues to represent a 
pressing global public health 
challenge. The first step in 
addressing this dilemma is to 
recognize the magnitude of the 
problem through careful case 
definition. Since the authors’
 
diagnostic guidelines were published 
in 2005, considerable progress has 
been made in further specifying 
the anatomic and neurobehavioral 
characteristics of FASD. These 
updated guidelines reflect consensus 
among a large and experienced 
cadre of FASD investigators in 
the fields of dysmorphology, 
epidemiology, neurology, 
psychology, developmental/
behavioral pediatrics, and 
educational diagnostics. They 
do not necessarily represent the 
policy of the American Academy of 
Pediatrics. The improved specificity 
of these guidelines will aid clinicians 
in assignment of more accurate 
diagnoses of alcohol-exposed infants 
and children, thereby leading to 
more widespread early intervention 
and improved prevention efforts.

Dr Hoyme was the fi
 rst author of the original diagnostic guidelines for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) published in Pediatrics in 2005, conceptualized 
and designed the study, and drafted the initial document; Ms Kalberg with Dr Coles formulated the psychological testing battery used for the subjects and 
assisted in assignment of FASD diagnoses, along with Drs Elliott and Coles she was charged with clarifying the defi
 nition of alcohol-related neurodevelopmental 
disorder, and she revised the document; Dr Elliott assisted with assignment of FASD diagnoses, along with Ms Kalberg and Dr Coles she was charged with 
clarifying the defi
 nition of alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, and she revised the document; Dr Blankenship and Mr Buckley comprised the data 
analysis group for the FASD team collaboration, they oversaw the gathering, storing, and analysis of sensitive subject data, and produced tables and fi
 gures for 
the manuscript; Dr Blankenship died before submission of the paper; Mr Buckley revised the document; Ms Marais coordinated the multidisciplinary diagnostic 
case conferences on the children from whom the data for this report were collected and revised the document; Drs Manning, Robinson, Adam, Abdul-Rahman, 
Jewett, and Jones examined all of the children in the studies on which the updated criteria are based, assigned diagnostic categories to the subjects, aided 
in crafting the defi
 nitions of the updated diagnostic criteria, and revised the document; Dr Coles contributed signifi
 cantly to the clarifi
 cation of alcohol-related 
neurodevelopmental disorder and revised the manuscript; Dr Chambers contributed signifi
 cantly to the development of the overall diagnostic scheme for FASD 
and revised the manuscript; Dr Adnams developed the psychological and neuropsychological testing battery and oversaw the testing of the large South African 
cohort of children examined over the past decade, participated in developing the neuropsychological criteria set forth in the article, and revised the document; 
Dr Shah authored the sections on the natural history of the neurobehavioral phenotype of FASD over the life span, and revised the document; Drs Riley and 
Charness added signifi
 cantly to the formulation of the specifi
