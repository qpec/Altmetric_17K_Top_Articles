ABSTRACT
Background Studies finding higher mortality
rates for patients admitted to hospital at
weekends rely on routine administrative data to
adjust for risk of death, but these data may not
adequately capture severity of illness. We
examined how rates of patient arrival at accident
and emergency (A&E) departments by
ambulance—a marker of illness severity—were
associated with in-hospital mortality by day and
time of attendance.
Methods Retrospective observational study of
3 027 946 admissions to 140 non-specialist
hospital trusts in England between April 2013
and February 2014. Patient admissions were
linked with A&E records containing mode of
arrival and date and time of attendance. We
classified arrival times by day of the week and
daytime (07:00 to 18:59) versus night (19:00 to
06:59 the following day). We examined the
association with in-hospital mortality within
30 days using multivariate logistic regression.
Results Over the week, 20.9% of daytime
arrivals were in the highest risk quintile
compared with 18.5% for night arrivals. Daytime
arrivals on Sundays contained the highest
proportion of patients in the highest risk quintile
at 21.6%. Proportions of admitted patients
brought in by ambulance were substantially
higher at night and higher on Saturday (61.1%)
and Sunday (60.1%) daytimes compared with
other daytimes in the week (57.0%). Without
adjusting for arrival by ambulance, risk-adjusted
mortality for patients arriving at night was higher
than for daytime attendances on Wednesday
(0.16 percentage points). Compared with
Wednesday daytime, risk-adjusted mortality was
also higher on Thursday night (0.15 percentage
points) and increased throughout the weekend
from Saturday daytime (0.16 percentage points)
to Sunday night (0.26 percentage points). After
adjusting for arrival by ambulance, the raised
mortality only reached statistical significance for
patients arriving at A&E on Sunday daytime (0.17
percentage points).
Conclusion Using conventional risk-adjustment
methods, there appears to be a higher risk of
mortality following emergency admission to
hospital at nights and at weekends. After
accounting for mode of arrival at hospital, this
pattern changes substantially, with no increased
risk of mortality following admission at night or
for any period of the weekend apart from
Sunday daytime. This suggests that risk-
adjustment based on inpatient administrative
data does not adequately account for illness
severity and that elevated mortality at weekends
and at night reflects a higher proportion of more
severely ill patients arriving by ambulance at
these times.
BACKGROUND
It has been widely observed that death
rates among patients admitted to hospital
in an emergency vary across days of the
week, with higher mortality rates experi-
enced by patients admitted at weekends
compared with midweek days.1–7 There
is no conclusive evidence on the causes
of
this
phenomenon,
termed
‘the
weekend effect’, and it has prompted
much debate.8–11

 Concerns that the ‘weekend effect’ reflects inad-
equate quality of care on admission due to reduced
staffing
levels
at
weekends
have
prompted
the
National Health Service (NHS) in England to extend
emergency hospital services at weekends in line with
the government’s commitment to providing uniform
quality of care on each day of the week.12
13
Hospitals are required to implement new clinical stan-
dards for ‘7-day services’, which include providing
emergency admissions with a thorough clinical assess-
ment by a suitable consultant within 14 hours of
arrival and timely
24-hour access to consultant-
directed interventions.
However, recent evidence aligns with the hypothesis
that higher mortality following weekend admission
reflects differences in the volume and severity of
patients admitted at weekend.14–16 Concerns about
the adequacy of administrative data to account fully
for fluctuations in the severity of patients admitted to
hospital at different times of the week have been
raised,16–20 suggesting that more accurate adjustment
for severity of illness could explain the weekend
effect.
The majority of studies identifying a weekend effect
have relied on analyses of routinely collected inpatient
administrative databases and have therefore adjusted
for patient risk accounting for demographic character-
istics, primary diagnosis and comorbidity measures
based
on
reported
International
Classification
of
Diseases
(ICD)-10
codes.17
While
these
risk-
adjustment models exhibit high explanatory power in
predicting mortality, they cannot account fully for
severity of illness.17 18 21 Studies based on data from
specialist clinical databases and audits for specific dis-
eases
or
clinical
departments
have
used
richer
risk-adjustment models that account for variations in
severity of illness within a diagnostic and comorbidity
group. These studies have found little or no significant
difference in death rates by day of admission.16 19
However, these studies have focused on patients with
specific conditions.
In
this
study,
we
use
national
administrative
inpatient data merged with previously underused data
on attendances at accident and emergency (A&E)
departments. These contain information on whether
the patient arrived by ambulance, an additional indi-
cator of severity22 not available in the inpatient data.
Despite ambulance services being available 24 hours
each day of the week, the proportion of patients arriv-
ing
by ambulance
varies
substantially
across
the
week.22 W
e examine how the inclusion of information
on arrival by ambulance in the risk-adjustment model
affects the observed pattern of mortality across the
week.
The attendance data also enable us to use informa-
tion on the time of arrival at hospital in addition to
the day of arrival. Studies have shown that patterns of
outcomes differ throughout the whole week and
between day and night-times, and that either being
admitted overnight or receiving care overnight tends
to be associated with worse outcomes.7 14 23 24 This
suggests that the description of the weekly variation in
care quality as a weekend effect is an oversimplifica-
tion.14 25 If fluctuations in staffing levels are the cause
of the weekend effect, we would expect to see the pat-
terns of patient mortality align with the typical shift
patterns worked by senior medical staff.
METHODS
Data sources
W
e used patient-level data on all admissions to hos-
pital and all attendances at A&E departments in
England for the period 1 April 2013 to 28 March
2014 extracted from Hospital Episode Statistics.26 27
The inpatient records contain information on date
of admission, gender, age, ethnic group, primary and
secondary diagnoses, and whether the patient was
admitted via A&E.28 W
e identified patients who had
died in any hospital within 30 days of admission using
the information on dates of death on discharge.28 The
A&E records contain information on individual atten-
dances at A&E departments, including the time of arrival
and whether the patient arrived by ambulance.29
Linked admission and A&E attendance record iden-
tifiers were provided by the Health and Social Care
Information Centre (HSCIC).30 Admission records
and attendance records were linked using a matching
algorithm based on an encrypted person identifier,
dates of discharge from A&E departments and dates
of admission to hospital and a set of criteria to priori-
tise
conflicting
information
from
the
two
data
sources.30 In cases of multiple episodes within an
admission spell, the first episode was used for linkage.
In cases of multiple attendances at A&E on the same
day, the last attendance was used. Socioeconomic
deprivation, measured by the 2010 Index of Multiple
Deprivation in the area of residence,31 was linked
through patient Lower-level Super Output Area, pro-
vided in the data.28
W
e restricted the sample to emergency admissions
via A&E at 140 non-specialist acute hospitals in
England, for which mortality indicators are routinely
reported. The case-mixes of these hospitals are more
comparable to each other than those of specialist hos-
pitals.32 W
e included patients admitted to hospital
between 1 April 2013 and 28 February 2014 to allow
a 30-day follow-up period for all patients over which
to analyse mortality. W
e excluded all but the first
admission in cases of multiple admissions in the last
30 days of life.
Of the 3 427 133 admission records, 64 912 (1.9%)
were excluded due to lack of complete information on
the risk-adjustment variables. There was no matching
A&E record for 334 275 admissions (9.9% of the total
of 3 362 221 admissions with complete information on
the risk adjusters used in the analysis) (see online

 supplementary appendix figure A1). Patterns of mortality
by day of the week were broadly similar in the included
and
excluded
records
(see
online
supplementary
appendix table A2). W
e carried out the main analysis on
3 027 946 merged admission and A&E records with
complete information on the risk adjusters.
Statistical analysis
W
e first constructed a standard risk-adjustment model
estimating each patient’s risk of mortality within
30 days using a logistic regression model that included
the following variables taken from the inpatient
records: the interaction between gender and age (in
5-year age bands), ethnicity, primary diagnosis (based
on ICD-10 classification and defined according to
Summary
Hospital-level
Mortality
Indictor-grouped
Clinical Classifications Software33 34), a set of 30 binary
indicators for comorbidities recorded in the secondary
diagnosis
fields
(measured
using
Elixhauser
condi-
tions20 35 36), source of admission (home or another hos-
pital provider or institution), deprivation in the patient’s
area of residence (categorised in quintiles), admitting
hospital and month of admission. W
e then categorised
the predicted risk of mortality into five quintiles.
W
e examined how the predicted risk of mortality
varied by time of arrival at A&E and by mode of
arrival. To reflect senior doctors’ working times,37 we
classified time of arrival at A&E into 14 twelve-hour
periods by dividing the week into seven daytime
periods (07:00 to 18:59) and seven night periods
(19:00 to 06:59 the following day). W
e classified
attendance at A&E in three categories defined accord-
ing to arrival mode: by ambulance, by ‘other’ modes
(non-ambulance) and unknown (patients with missing
information that could potentially be included in both
categories).29 Ambulance arrivals include all forms of
ambulance, but >98% are by emergency ambulance.22
W
e then used logistic regression models to analyse
differences in the probability of death within 30 days
of admission across the 14 twelve-hour time of arrival
periods, with W
ednesday daytime as the reference cat-
egory (model 1). W
e used the same risk-adjustment
variables as in the main analysis.
W
e examined whether mortality was associated with
the mode of arrival at A&E and whether this factor
influenced the size of the estimated differences in
mortality by day of the week and time of the day in
two
ways:
first,
by
modifying
the
standard
risk-adjustment model with the addition of arrival
mode (model 2), and second, by carrying out the ana-
lysis stratified by arrival mode (ambulance vs non-
ambulance; models 3 and 4). W
e did not carry out
stratified analysis for patients with unknown mode of
arrival at A&E due to the small size of this group
(11 846 records, 0.39% of the total).
SEs were clustered at the individual level to account
for repeated admissions of each individual patient. W
e
used the C-statistic to discriminate across models.
Analyses were undertaken using Stata V
.14, using a
significance level of 5% throughout.
RESULTS
Association between crude risk of mortality and day and
time of attendance
Of all 3 027 946 patients admitted to hospital follow-
ing attendance at A&E, the majority (1 907 920,
63.0%)
attended
A&E
during
daytime,
while
the remaining 1 120 026 (37.0%) attended at night
(table 1, column 1).
The crude mortality rates are higher for patients
attending A&E during the day compared with at night
(table 1, column 3); 3.66% of patients attending on
W
ednesday daytime die within 30 days compared with
3.48% of patients attending on W
ednesday night-time.
The crude mortality rates are highest for those attend-
ing on Sunday daytime (4.12%) and Saturday (4.00%)
daytime, and lowest for those attending on Friday
night (3.28%) and Saturday night (3.32%).
The higher crude mortality rates during daytime
reflect the higher proportions of patients in the
highest risk quintile (as measured using the standard
risk-adjustment model) among those arriving during
daytime
compared
with
those
arriving
at
night
(figure 1). Over the whole week, 20.9% of daytime
arrivals were in the highest risk quintile compared
with 18.5% for night arrivals. Daytime arrivals on
Sundays contained the highest proportion of patients in
the highest risk quintile (21.59%), followed by daytime
arrivals on Saturdays (21.38%) and Fridays (20.89%).
The proportions of patients in the highest risk quintile
among those arriving at night were similar across the
days of the week, with the highest proportions on
Mondays (18.97%) and W
ednesdays (18.9%) and the
lowest proportion on Saturdays (17.62%).
Association between risk of mortality and mode of arrival
The majority (1 863 246, 61.5%) of patients admitted
to hospital after attendance at A&E were brought into
hospital by ambulance (table 1, column 1). Patients
admitted after being brought into A&E by ambulance
were at a higher risk of death compared with those
arriving by other modes (crude mortality rates 5.46%
vs 0.78%, table 1, column 3). 27.4% of patients
admitted to hospital following arrival at A&E by
ambulance were in the highest risk quintile and
52.8%
were
in
the
two
highest
risk
quintiles
(figure 2). Only 8.1% of patients who were admitted
after arriving at A&E by other means were in the
highest risk quintile, while the majority were in the
lowest risk quintile (31.9%) and over half of them
(61.2%) were in the two lowest risk quintiles.
Association between day and time of attendance and
mode of arrival
The proportion of admitted patients brought into
A&E by ambulance was higher at night (average

 67.6%) compared with daytime (average 57.1%), with
the highest proportions on Saturday night (69.0%)
and Friday night (68.1%) and the lowest proportion
on Monday night (66.5%) (figure 3). For daytimes,
the proportion of admitted patients brought in by
ambulance
was
substantially
higher
on
Saturdays
(61.1%) and Sundays (60.1%) compared with other
days of the week (57.0% on average).
Association between risk-adjusted mortality and day and
time of attendance
Using standard risk adjusters (excluding arrival mode;
model 1: table 1, column 4), mortality rates were sig-
nificantly higher, compared with W
ednesday daytime,
for patients arriving at A&E during the week at night,
on W
ednesday (0.16 percentage points; OR 1.055, CI
1.016 to 1.096) and Thursday (0.15 percentage
points; OR 1.052, CI 1.031 to 1.092). Risk-adjusted
mortality rates increased through the weekend from
Saturday daytime (0.16 percentage points; OR 1.058,
CI 1.025 to 1.092) to Sunday night (0.26 percentage
points; OR 1.096, CI 1.055 to 1.137).
Risk-adjusted mortality was substantially lower for
patients arriving by non-ambulance modes (−2.4 per-
centage points; OR 0.339, CI 0.330 to 0.348) and
unknown modes (−2.0 percentage points; OR 0.456,
CI 0.380 to 0.548), compared with patients arriving

 by ambulance (model 2: table 1, column 6). After con-
trolling for arrival mode, Sunday daytime was the
only time period associated with a higher mortality
risk (0.17 percentage points; OR 1.061, CI 1.028 to
1.095) compared with W
ednesday daytime.
The patterns of mortality among patients arriving
by ambulance (model 3: table 1, column 8) were
similar to those for all patients after adjusting for
arrival mode. Mortality was only significantly higher
for patients arriving on Sunday daytime, both among
patients
arriving
by
ambulance
(0.23
percentage
points; OR 1.055, CI 1.020 to 1.090) and among
patients arriving by non-ambulance modes (0.11 per-
centage points; OR 1.186, CI 1.070 to 1.314, model
4: table 1, column 10).
Figure 4 shows how the estimated effects of time
and day of arrival at A&E on mortality change after
including mode of arrival in the risk-adjustment
models. The trend towards increased risk of mortality
for night-time admission is reversed, with lower
mortality
for
patients
arriving
overnight
from
Monday to Saturday. Figure 5 shows that the same
pattern is observed among patients arriving by ambu-
lance. There is more variation in mortality among
patients arriving by non-ambulance modes but only
Sunday daytime differs significantly from W
ednesday
daytime.
DISCUSSION
Principal findings
W
e analysed the association between risk-adjusted
mortality and day and time of arrival for patients
admitted to hospital after attendance at A&E. When
controlling only for the risk adjusters available in
inpatient
administrative
records
as
in
previous
studies,1–7 mortality was found to be significantly
higher for patients admitted to hospital throughout
the weekend and on W
ednesday and Thursday nights.
Patients arriving at A&E by ambulance had a higher
risk of mortality and higher proportions of patients

Accounting for mode of arrival substantially altered
the observed pattern of mortality throughout the
week. Only patients admitted via A&E on Sunday
daytime had an increased risk of mortality compared
with patients admitted on W
ednesday daytime, and
patients admitted on Monday and Friday nights had
significantly
lower
risk.

the

periods were associated with higher risk of mortality.
Strengths and weaknesses
W
e made innovative use of information on mode of
arrival to account for severity of illness in patients
admitted to hospital in an emergency. W
e investigated
the
hypothesis
that
the
differences
in
mortality
throughout the week observed in previous studies
using national administrative records are explained by
previously
unmeasured
differences
in
severity
of
illness.17 18 21
This study focuses only on patients admitted in an
emergency after attending A&E, who represent 80%
of all emergency admissions and 89% of weekend
emergency admissions.15 However, since this group
experiences a different profile of mortality rates than
patients admitted directly to hospital,15 we cannot test
whether
our
results
generalise
to
all
inpatient
admissions.
A&E records are known to be less complete and
accurate than inpatient records.38 W
e relied mainly on
the
better
quality
data
extracted
from
inpatient
records and only used information on arrival time and
mode of arrival from the A&E record. No specific
concerns about these variables have been raised by the
HSCIC in their audits of the quality of A&E records.
Although any variation in accuracy of recording by
time and day could bias our results, we examined the
patterns of mortality by day of the week for complete
versus incomplete A&E records and found them to be
broadly similar, suggesting that the incompleteness of
records is unlikely to have biased our analysis (see
online supplementary appendix table A2).
W
e were restricted by data availability to deaths
that
occur
in
hospital
and
could
not
examine
out-of-hospital deaths. However, >80% of all deaths
within 30 days of an emergency admission occur in
hospital and the proportion is higher at weekends,
leading to a small bias towards finding a weekend
effect.15
W
e used the time of attendance at A&E rather than
the time of admission to hospital as our index time.
W
e argue that the time of attendance is more appro-
priate since this is the point at which hospitals
become responsible for patient care. Nonetheless, for
comparability with previous studies, we repeated our
analysis using the time of departure from A&E to
approximate the time of admission to hospital. The
basic patterns of mortality across the week were
unaffected
(see
online
supplementary
appendix
table A4).
W
e used a classification of daytime versus night-time
that was consistent with senior doctors’ working
hours.23 W
e checked that our results were robust to
using
an
alternative
definition
of
daytime
and
night-time (08:00 to 19:59 and 20:00 to 07:59 the
following day), as has been used in a previous study.24
The changes to the point estimates of the ORs for
our main analysis (full risk adjustment including
mode of admission) were small and the OR for
Sunday daytime remained the largest (see online
supplementary appendix table A5).
Comparison with previous studies
Previous studies using national administrative data
have consistently found mortality to be elevated for
patients admitted to hospital at the weekend com-
pared with their counterparts admitted during the
week.1–7 However, these studies suffer from two
major limitations. First, they have been constrained by
the absence of information on patients’ time of arrival
at hospital and have been forced to classify the
weekend crudely by dates as 00:00 Saturday to 23:59
Sunday.1–4 6 Second, these studies have been limited
in how they could adjust for severity of illness.
To allow comparison of our results with previous
studies using only inpatient data,1–4 6 15 we carried
out the same analysis to test how the addition of
arrival mode would change the association between
mortality and day of admission to hospital or admis-
sion at weekend. Day of admission was defined as
00:00 to 23:59 based on information in inpatient
records. The results obtained using standard risk
adjusters were similar to previous studies15 and inclu-
sion of arrival mode reduced the elevation of mortal-
ity at weekends (from OR 1.046, CI 1.031 to 1.061,
to
OR
1.024,
CI
1.008
to
1.039)
(see
online
supplementary appendix tables A6 and A7).
Including arrival mode in the risk-adjustment model
accounted for most of the differences in mortality
between different days and different times, leaving
Sunday daytime as the only period associated with a
higher risk of death. These findings were replicated
when we stratified the analysis by mode of arrival.
Our results are in line with previous studies that have
used clinical audit data and concluded that the eleva-
tion of mortality at weekends disappears once indica-
tors of severity are controlled for.14 16 In contrast to
these studies, however, we analysed a large national
data set and considered all clinical causes of admis-
sions. Nonetheless, arrival by ambulance is an imper-
fect proxy for severity of illness. It is likely that there
are further unmeasured aspects of severity related to
the risk of mortality that differ between patients
admitted at different times of the week.

 Implications and future research
Current extensions of emergency hospital services at
weekends in the NHS in England are only likely to be
successful in addressing the weekend effect if it is
caused by reduced availability of hospital services on
the day of admission. By accounting for patient arrival
at hospital by ambulance, we have shown that much
of the weekend effect identified in previous studies is
likely to be explained by variations in severity of
illness. With the exception of Sunday daytime, ele-
vated mortality among admissions at weekends reflects
a higher proportion of patients arriving by ambulance.
Most of the debate on 7-day services has focused on
weekend care. Our results suggest that a more granu-
lar approach to time classification is needed to fully
capture the variations in the flow of patients and the
services offered across times of the day in addition to
days of the week.
In addition to the patient’s mode of arrival at hos-
pital, other information on the services that patients
have accessed prior to their arrival at hospital should
be included in future studies to further understand
mortality risk. Such proxies will, however, always be
inferior to direct measurement of illness severity,
which is required in order for clinicians and policy-
makers to make valid comparisons of outcomes over
time and across providers. Our results therefore add
to the increasing body of evidence highlighting the
limitations of the risk adjusters available in inpatient
records when standardised mortality rates are inter-
preted as an indicator of hospital quality.39
When assessing quality of care, there are many im-
portant aspects beyond mortality; the vast majority of
patients admitted to hospital do not die. The time
taken to receive necessary scans and procedures has
been shown to vary throughout the week in condition-
specific
studies
using
clinical
audit
data.14

emporal variations in quality indicators beyond mor-
tality warrant further investigation.
