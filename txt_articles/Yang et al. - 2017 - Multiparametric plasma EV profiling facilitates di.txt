Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is usually detected late in the disease process. Clinical workup through
imaging and tissue biopsies is often complex and expensive due to a paucity of reliable biomarkers. We used an
advanced multiplexed plasmonic assay to analyze circulating tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (tEVs) in more
than 100 clinical populations. Using EV-based protein marker profiling, we identified a signature of five markers
(PDACEV signature) for PDAC detection. In our prospective cohort, the accuracy for the PDACEV signature was
84% [95% confidence interval (CI), 69 to 93%] but only 63 to 72% for single-marker screening. One of the best markers,
GPC1 alone, had a sensitivity of 82% (CI, 60 to 95%) and a specificity of 52% (CI, 30 to 74%), whereas the PDACEV
signature showed a sensitivity of 86% (CI, 65 to 97%) and a specificity of 81% (CI, 58 to 95%). The PDACEV signature
of tEVs offered higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy than the existing serum marker (CA 19-9) or single–tEV
marker analyses. This approach should improve the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.
INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause
of cancer death in the United States, with a 5-year survival rate below
10%. Most newly diagnosed patients’ (>80%) tumors are considered
unresectable (1). Earlier detection could increase survival by an esti-
mated 30 to 40% (2), and more reliable and real-time assessment of
treatment effects could prolong survival and/or improve quality of life.
Detecting serum concentrations of CA 19-9 is currently the best
established blood test for PDAC and has a pooled sensitivity of
75.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 73.4 to 77.4%] and a specificity
of 77.6% (CI, 75.4 to 79.7%) (3). Although often used to follow treat-
ment response, CA 19-9 is a poor biomarker for early detection,
commonly rises late in the disease, and may be elevated in non-
malignant conditions such as biliary obstruction and pancreatitis (4).
Recent modeling studies on assay performance cite a minimum sen-
sitivity of 88% and a specificity of 85% to prolong patient survival and
demonstrate cost effectiveness (2). Various approaches to achieving
this are being explored (5, 6), including the use of CA242 (3), circulat-
ing tumor cells (7), circulating tumor-derived extracellular vesicles
(tEVs), which include exosomes (8), metabolites (9) and proteomic
analyses (10, 11), and circulating DNA (12). Beyond the inherent
technical challenges of these advanced analyses, a key question is
whether early reported findings can be validated independently in
larger sets of patients.
tEVs offer an attractive approach to monitoring cancers using “liq-
uid biopsies.” tEVs are relatively more abundant than other circulating
biomarkers, are structurally more stable, and contain protein and
mRNA profiles that highly reflect parental cancer cells (13–15). Exper-
imental studies have shed light on the composition and functional roles
of tEVs (16, 17) for (i) diagnosis (13, 18, 19), (ii) long-range communi-
cation (16), and (iii) host cell interaction (20). Rapid and accurate anal-
ysis of tEVs in clinical samples is often hampered by three practical
challenges: lengthy isolation procedures requiring ultracentrifugation
to isolate tEVs, general unavailability of ultrasensitive assay systems
to analyze large clinical cohorts for multiple markers, and specific
cancer markers that separate tEVs from host cell EVs. Here, we devel-
oped an advanced plasmonic sensing system for higher-throughput
analysis of clinical samples to directly address the shortcomings often
found in translational clinical analyses. The basic operating principle
relies on measuring spectral shifts of resonant light transmission
through periodically arranged gold nanopores to which tEVs are
captured by immunoaffinity. In proof-of-principle cancer experiments,
we showed that tEVs can be detected by plasmonic sensors (14). How-
ever, the original prototype was manually operated and had limited
throughput and chipproduction rates,thuspreventing widespreadclin-
ical use. As a result, we devised a multiparametric system incorporating
large numbers of sensing arrays (>100 sensing spots) and automatic
operation to enable routine clinical sample analyses. Intrigued by recent
reports (8, 21), we set out to determine key protein profiles of tEVs in
135 patients undergoing surgery for pancreatic pathologies. Motivated
by clinical needs, we were particularly interested in defining practical
and reliable tEV marker sets for PDAC diagnosis.
RESULTS
Nanoplasmonic sensors for high-throughput, sensitive
analyses of EVs
Figure 1 summarizes the working principle of the nanoplasmonic sen-
sor (NPS) assay, specifically designed for clinical workflows, small
clinical sample amounts, and high-throughput detection. The sensor
chip contains periodically arranged nanopores (200 nm in diameter
and 500 nm in periodicity) patterned in a 100-nm-thick gold film.
The function of the pores is to transmit light shone onto the gold

 surface (Fig. 1A). When EVs are bound
in the vicinity of these pores via specific
antibodies, the wavelength of the tran-
sited light shifts to red. It is this red shift
that is detected by sensors and reflects
the amount of bound EVs (Fig. 1, B
and C).
The sensor chip is easily scalable to
larger arrays of more than 1000 sensing
sites; multiple sensor chips can be made
through batch fabrication processes (see
Materials and Methods for details). We
prepared a customized chip with 100 de-
tection sites to yield data for 25 antibodies/
markers in quadruplicate. Antibody and
EV solutions were printed on the sensor
chip in spots as small as 100 nl through a
molecularprintingmethod.Apiezoelectric
microscope stage was incorporated into
the system for scanning sensing arrays
and collecting transmission spectra. Both
printing and measurements are operated
automaticallytoimproveassaythroughput
and reduce variation among users. Overall,
the smaller chip size, higher spot density,
and smaller measurement volumes re-
sulted in a 25× increase in sensitivity com-
pared to a previous prototype (120 ml for
12 markers versus 10 ml for 25 markers).

sensing arrays and the integrated setup op-
timized for processing clinical samples.

has insufficient sensitivity or specificity. Proteome analyses have iden-
tified soluble markers (11, 22–24), and profiling studies have identified

Downloaded from 
 on whole pancreatic cancer cells (fig. S2). On the basis of the cell data,
we eliminated some of the non–cancer-specific markers and per-
formed NPS measurements on tEVs (Fig. 2A). Beyond the commonly
used PDAC cell lines, we also investigated 11 patient-derived tumor
xenograft (PDX) models of PDAC, metastatic PDAC, and intraductal
papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) (Fig. 2A). Our data show good
correlation between expression patterns seen in whole cells and tEVs
(Spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.86 for 1157-PDAC, 1222-PDAC,
1247-PDAC, and 1494-PDAC; Fig. 2B). The tEV assays by the NPS chip
are on the order of 102 more sensitive than the gold standard enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for this analysis (Fig. 2C).
Establishing a PDAC tEV panel
We next collected plasma from 32 patients enrolled in a training
cohort involving 22 cases of PDAC and 10 healthy controls (Table 1).
Figure 3A summarizes the chosen tEV markers for each patient, includ-
ing pan-cancer markers (EGFR, EPCAM, HER2, and MUC1) and pu-
tative PDAC markers [GPC1, WNT2, and GRP94 (30)]. Using receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, we determined sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy for each marker individually and also in com-
bination (Fig. 3B and Table 2). We observed that no single marker
achieved sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, we rea-
soned that a combination of multiple markers would be necessary. A
previously identified generic quad marker cancer signature (31) (EGFR,
EPCAM, HER2, and MUC1) had high sensitivity (91%), specificity
(100%), and accuracy (94%). When we replaced HER2 with putative
PDACmarkers(GPC1andWNT2),wefurtherimprovedthesensitivity
and specificity (Table 2). This PDACEV signature, representing an
unweighted sum of EGFR, EPCAM, MUC1, GPC1, and WNT2 signals,
had an accuracy of 100% in this training cohort (Fig. 3, C and D).
Because of the limited sample size (n = 32), we also tested all four and
five marker combinations in the prospective cohort described below.
A number of observations were of particular interest. First, some of
the chosen markers highly expressed in EVs did not provide diagnos-
tic information (Rab5b, CD9, and CD63; fig. S3) and were thus elimi-
nated from the ensuing prospective study. Second, GPC1 was not
specific for PDAC in our cohort and had a lower accuracy as a single
marker than marker combinations, similar to other markers tested.
These findings did not change by using alternative commercially avail-
able GPC1 antibodies, all of which were validated before use (table S1).
Third, other putative PDAC markers such as WNT2 showed better
accuracy than GPC1.
Validation cohort
We next analyzed a prospective cohort of 43 patients undergoing sur-
gery for pancreatic (n = 35) or other abdominal indications (n = 8,
age-matched control group). In all 35 patients operated for pancreatic
indications, tissue was available for clinical pathology interpretation
(n = 22 for PDAC, n = 8 for pancreatitis, and n = 5 for benign cystic
tumor). We obtained 2 to 10 ml of plasma from each patient on the
day of or immediately preceding surgery, and NPS measurements
were performed using identical markers from our training cohorts
(see Materials and Methods for details).
Figure 4A summarizes the performance of the PDAC markers in
differentiating PDAC from pancreatitis, benign, and control patient
groups. Analyzing the heat map of EV markers once again demon-
strated that no single patient had similar markers elevated. Rather, it
was the combination of the five markers comprising the PDACEV sig-
nature that resulted in an overall accuracy of 84%. In this prospective
cohort, the PDACEV signature (EGFR, EPCAM, MUC1, WNT2, and

 GPC1) identified in the training cohort showed a sensitivity of 86%
(CI, 65 to 97%) and a specificity of 81% (CI, 58 to 95%; Fig. 4B and
Table 2), whereas total EV concentrations were not significantly dif-
ferent between the groups (Dunn’s multiple comparisons test, P =
0.16 for PDAC and pancreatitis; P = 0.78 for PDAC and control)
(Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the expression of GPC1 was not significantly
different in PDAC relative to pancreatitis (P = 0.31) but was slightly
higher in PDAC when compared to the control group (median values
of 0.20 for PDAC and 0.02 for the control group; P = 0.018) (Fig. 4D).
Figure 5 displays the experimental data of single markers and combi-
nations as a waterfall plot. Table 2 summarizes the diagnostic accura-
cies of all markers and combinations in this prospective cohort.
We next correlated EV analyses to clinical gold standard serum
biomarkers (CA 19-9 and CEA) in patients with PDAC. The PDACEV
signature was not correlated with either CA 19-9 (Spearman correlation
coefficient r = −0.28; P = 0.26) or CEA (r < 0.001; P > 0.99) (Fig. 6A).In
our cohort, only 61%of PDACpatients (11 of 18) showed anincreased
concentration of CA 19-9 (>37 U/ml, threshold value used in clinic),
whereas 89% (16 of 18) had high PDACEV values (>0.87 NPS signal;
Table 2). For CEA, only 17% of PDAC patients (3 of 18) were positive
(>5 ng/ml; Fig. 6B). Finally, we compared the PDACEV signature
against tumor size, showing a modest correlation for the signature
(r = 0.58; P = 0.018) and little correlation (r = −0.09; P = 0.62) between
EV counts and tumor size (Fig. 6C and fig. S4).
To further expand the clinical use of tEV analyses, we also studied
several additional patient cohorts (n = 69; Table 1; Fig. 7 and figs. S5
and S6): (i) PDAC treated with neoadjuvant regimen (n = 24), (ii)
IPMN (n = 14), (iii) other gastrointestinal (GI) cancers mimicking
the symptoms of pancreaticoduodenal cancers (n = 11), (iv) pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors (NETs; n = 12), and (v) benign cystic tumors
(n = 5). Patients with PDAC treated with neoadjuvant regimen had
lower EV signatures (median values, 1.70 versus 0.86; Mann-Whitney
test, P = 0.015) (fig. S7A) as a group compared to the untreated PDAC
group, likely reflecting the smaller tumor mass and/or favorable treat-
ment response.
We also studied a number of cases of IPMNs, which grow within
the pancreatic ducts and are characterized by the production of thick
mucinous fluid. IPMNs are important because some of them pro-
gress to invasive cancer and may therefore represent windows of op-
portunity to treat before aggressive and difficult-to-manage cancer
develops. Our cohort contained 11 cases of intermediate and high-
grade IPMN and 2 cases of low-grade IPMN (Fig. 7 and Table 1). As
shown in fig. S7B, IPMN had an elevated PDACEV signature com-
pared to age-matched controls (Dunn’s multiple comparisons test,
P < 0.0001), but it was lower compared to PDAC (P = 0.022).
The validation cohort included a limited number of other pan-
creatic cancers or cancers that can mimic pancreatic symptomatol-
ogy. These included NETs and gastroduodenal cancers. Again,

 although the numbers are limited, most of the malignancies tested
positive for some of the EV markers (for example, among 23 patients,
18 were positive for EGFR and/or EPCAM). These findings are in line
with other observations. For example, EPCAM has been evaluated as a
CTC detection marker in NET populations (32, 33). Of particular in-
terest was the fact that 9 of 12 NETs tested positive for SSTR2 expres-
sion on EVs, whereas all PDAC patients (n = 22) and age-matched
healthy controls (n = 8) were negative for SSTR2 with a threshold
value of 0.15 (Dunn’s multiple comparisons test, P < 0.0001 between
PDAC and NET; P = 0.0018 between NET and control) (fig. S7C). Fi-
nally, we investigated a limited number of patients with benign muci-
nous tumors but no detectable malignancy. In these cases, we
observed PDACEV signatures similar to the age-matched control
group (Mann-Whitney test, P = 0.35; fig. S7D).
DISCUSSION
EVs are attractive as circulating biomarkers given their abundance,
relative stability, and similar molecular makeup to parental cells
(13–15). Despite these apparent advantages, it has been difficult
to define single tumor-specific EV markers (mRNA, DNA, or pro-
tein) (8, 28, 34), validate purported malignancy biomarkers in
larger patient cohorts (8, 13, 34), implement lengthy purification
procedures (ultracentrifugation) into the clinical workflow (13),
and commercialize cost-effective technologies. Here, we show in a
sizable pancreatic data set that single EV protein biomarkers are un-
likely to be sufficiently accurate to improve patient management. No
individual putative protein tEV marker (EGFR, EPCAM, MUC1,
GPC1, or WNT2) yielded sensitivities above 86% and specificities
above 81% to be considered cost-effective (2). Many had much lower
sensitivities/specificities, including GPC1, despite previous studies
(5, 8); unfortunately, the previously used GPC1 antibody is no longer

 commercially available. Therefore, there is a possibility that the dis-
crepancy could be attributed to the antibody used in the study.
On the basis of the hypothesis that tumoral heterogeneity will re-
quire multiplexed biomarkers for clinical use, we set out to define pro-
tein signatures representative of epithelial and pancreatic cancers (25).
We initially surveyed about 50 proteins of potential interest and dis-
carded all but 10 after feasibility studies in PDAC cell lines and PDX
models. These 10 EV markers included 7 tEV markers (EGFR, EPCAM,
MUC1, HER2, GPC1, WNT2, and GRP94) and 3 pan EV markers
(CD63, CD9, and Rab5b). The pan EV markers were excluded from
the tumor diagnostic marker panel and were solely used to confirm
the presence of EVs in a given sample. From an initial training data
set, we further refined the markers to five essential ones, which then con-
stituted our PDACEV signature (EGFR, EPCAM, MUC1, GPC1, and
WNT2). The signature was defined as the unweighted sum of each
marker expression, with a score of >0.85 suggesting PDAC. It is conceiv-
able to further improve on this panel by identifying additional molecular
tumor markers present on the EV surface. A number of proteomic
approaches have been used to identify putative markers, but validation
work remains to be done. It would also be attractive to expand the panel
to intravesicular markers such as mutant KRAS protein, but this would
require EV lysis and further NPS assay optimization.
Applying the above PDACEV signature to 43 patients, we showed
an overall sensitivity of 86% for detecting PDAC and a specificity of
81% for differentiating PDAC from other
pancreatic diseases (Table 2). The accura-
cy was 84% (CI, 69 to 93%). The relatively
high accuracy is most likely attributed to
the selection of protein EV markers, the
surgical patient cohorts enrolled, and ease
of measurements, resulting in reduced an-
alytical failures. The last point of particu-
lar interest is that existing EV analyses are
cumbersome and often require large sam-
ple amounts. In contradistinction, we set
out to develop a miniaturized sensing
technology with an automated microarray
spotter and scanning stage to perform
measurements at scales that are clinically
feasible and affordable. The NPS measurements performed here re-
quire ~10 min of measurement/analysis time and currently cost $60
(chip cost, $42; antibody cost, $18) per patient sample. Because the
majority of current costs are driven by manual manufacture of chips
and antibodies, it is expected that real costs will scale downward greatly
with bulk fabrication. The current limits of the NPS technology as
developed in this study are (i) the need for EV purification and con-
centration before measurement, (ii) lower sensitivity for intravesicular
markers, (iii) the need for high-quality antibodies that are necessary
for capture, and (iv) the composition of the marker panel. With fur-
ther optimization and commercialization, all these points could be ad-
dressed and further improved.
A number of previous studies have investigated tEV as a diagnostic
cancer marker by both protein and nucleic acid analyses (8, 13–15). Re-
maining questions include (i) whether these results hold up in larger pa-
tient cohorts and (ii) how cost-effective and practical are newer analytical
techniques. For example, Melo et al. (8) explored the use of GPC1 as a
single marker for detection of PDAC from EVs. Similarly, several studies
have explored the serum proteome of PDAC (22–24) with the goal of
providing more advanced diagnostic tools to guide clinicians. So far, mea-
surementoftEVappearstobeapromisingvenueforpancreaticdiagnoses.
The current study was designed as a feasibility study to focus on
some of the pressing questions in surgical oncology. Future studies
should expand tEV analysis to assess treatment efficacy. Although
the current study was not designed to investigate this, such work
has been done for other cancers (14, 15, 35). For example, we have
shown that longitudinal tEV profiling is feasible and can be informa-
tive in treatment assessment (14, 15, 35). Long-term efforts should also
include longitudinally analyzing high-risk subjects for PDAC develop-
ment, which will require larger data sets and multiyear follow-ups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
We used data collected from a pilot study at Massachusetts General
Hospital (MGH) to optimize use of the NPS technique for tEV detec-
tion in plasma and to identify useful biomarker combinations and their
detection thresholds as a training data set. To more accurately assess
the biomarkerperformance, we obtained an independent data set using
de-identified specimens from patients with pancreatic-related diseases
collected at MGH. Before processing clinical samples, we performed
exhaustiveanalysis of known EV protein biomarkers relevantto PDAC
in patient-derived cell lines. In addition, extensive correlation and op-
timization studies were performed to validate NPS measurements.

(n = 24), (iii) IPMN (n = 13), (iv) other GI cancers mimicking the symptoms of
pancreaticoduodenal cancers (n = 11), (v) pancreatic NET (n = 12), (vi) pancreatitis
(n = 8), (vii) benign cystic tumors (n = 5), and (viii) age-matched controls (n = 18).

 Cell lines
AsPC-1, MIA PaCa-2, PSN-1, and PANC-1 cell lines were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection. AsPC-1 and PSN-1 cells
weremaintainedinRPMI1640medium.MIAPaCa-2andPANC-1cells
were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium. All cell line
media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU of
penicillin, and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). PDAC PDX cell lines were
provided by C. Fernandez del Castillo and were all maintained in a
50:50 mix of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s and Ham’s F-12 medium
supplemented as above.
Selection of markers
Several PDAC proteomic studies have been described in the literature
(10, 11, 22–24, 29) or are available online (http://wlab.ethz.ch/cspa/;
https://www.proteomicsdb.org/#projects/4256; pancreaticcancerdatabase.
org/publications.php). These literature sources were analyzed to define
EV marker candidates. To derive the marker set, we surveyed these
available databases, three vesicle databases (Vesiclepedia, EVpedia,
and ExoCarta), and the literature for published markers. The puta-
tive “hits” were then screened using commercially available antibodies
(see table S1). We eliminated targets that were not specific for cancer
cells, yielded only duplicative information, or were primarily intravesi-
cular proteins, which we were not able to capture efficiently. From the
initial 50 candidate markers, we selected 10 after feasibility studies
with PDAC cell lines and PDX models (fig. S2). We decided to take
forward seven tumor markers, all of them vesicle surface markers that
can be used for chip capture. In addition, we assayed for three ubiquitous
EV markers: CD9, CD63, and Rab5b.
Antibody and biotinylation
All antibodies used in these studies are listed in table S1. For biotinyla-
tion, all antibodies [50 mg in 100 ml of phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS)] were first passed through 0.5 ml 7K MWCO Zeba Spin
Desalting columns (89882, ThermoFisher) to remove sodium azide.
EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (21327, ThermoFisher) was used for
antibody biotinylation according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
Briefly, antibodies were mixed with a 20-fold molar excess of 10 mM
biotinfor 30 min at roomtemperature. Excess biotinwas thenremoved
using a second Zeba Desalting column. Antibody concentration was
checked using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher).
Flow cytometry
Antibodies were tested and compared to EV signals from NPS using
flow cytometry. On the day of EV collection from cell lines, a portion
of the remaining cells were trypsinized for flow cytometry. Cells
(500,000 to 1,000,000 per condition) were fixed in 4% paraform-
aldehyde in PBS (15710-S, Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 10 min
at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS plus
0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Antibodies were diluted to
10 mg/ml in 100 ml of PBS plus 0.5% BSA and incubated with cells
for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS
plus 0.5% BSA and then incubated with appropriate Alexa Fluor 488
secondary antibody diluted 1:1000 in PBS plus 0.5% BSA for 30 min
at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS plus 0.5%
BSA. Fluorescent signal was measured using a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences) and compared to appropriate isotype
controls and secondary antibody–only signal using the following for-
mula: (signal primary antibody − signal isotype control)/signal sec-
ondary antibody.
EV isolation from cell culture
Cells were grown for 48 hours in normalgrowth medium supplemented
with 5% EV-depleted fetal bovine serum (A2720801, ThermoFisher).
Conditioned medium was collected in 50-ml tubes and centrifuged
at 300g for 10 min. Medium was filtered through a 0.22-mm cellulose
acetate vacuum filter (430767, Corning) and then aliquoted into ultra-
centrifuge tubes (344058, Beckman). Medium was centrifuged at
100,000g for 70 min to pellet EVs. The pellet was washed with PBS
and repelleted by centrifugation at 100,000g for 70 min. EVs were re-
suspended in an appropriate volume of PBS and stored at −80°C until
NPS measurement.
Sample collection
The current study was designed to prospectively obtain fresh samples
and then correlate them with pathological and clinical information.
All clinical data were entered into a unified database and used for
blinded analyses by the biobank coordinator at MGH. The biospeci-
men collection was optimized for EV analysis and included the
following steps: (i) collect whole blood into one 10-ml purple-top
EDTA tube, (ii) mix blood by inverting the tube 10 times, (iii) store
vacutainer tubes upright at 4°C and process within 1 hour of blood
collection, (iv) centrifuge blood samples for 10 min at 400g at 4°C,
(v) collect the plasma layer in a 15-ml conical tube with a pipette with-
out disturbing the buffy coat, (vi) centrifuge the plasma layer for
10 min at 1100g at 4°C, (vii) pipette the plasma into a 15-ml labeled
conical tube, and (viii) store at −80°C until processing.
EV isolation from plasma
Plasma was thawed, aliquoted into ultracentrifuge tubes, and diluted
to 30- to 35-ml total volume in PBS. Plasma was initially centrifuged
at 14,000g for 20 min to pellet cell debris. Cleared supernatant was
passed through a 0.22-mm polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) sy-
ringe filter into an ultracentrifuge tube. EVs were then pelleted by ul-
tracentrifugation at 100,000g for 70 min. The pellet was resuspended
in PBS and centrifuged again at 100,000g for 70 min. The final EV
pellets were resuspended in 300 ml of PBS and stored at −80°C until
NPS measurement.
EV size measurements
Nanoparticle tracking analysis (Nanosight) was used to assess EV size
and concentration. Measurements were done as reported in the liter-
ature (36). Briefly, samples were diluted in PBS (generally a 1:100 di-
lution). Five 30-s videos were recorded using the following settings for
all measurements: threshold, 1482; gain, 680. Videos were processed,
and the highest and lowest EV concentrations were excluded.
NPS fabrication
We used interference lithography to prepare NPS devices (fig. S1).
First, periodic nanohole patterns were made on a double-polished
4-inch (~10 cm) Si wafer coated with a 125-nm silicon nitride (SiN)
layer. The patterned wafer was dry-etched using reactive ion etching to
create nanoholes in the SiN layer. In this step, only a partial layer was
etched to protect the front Si surface from the subsequent silicon
etching with potassium hydroxide (KOH). The opposite Si backside
was lithographically patterned to define sensing sites and wet-etched
with KOH at 80°C. Patterned wafers were diced into individual NPS
chips, with each chip containing 100 (10 × 10) measurement sites.
After removing the remaining SiN layer, a 100-nm Au film with a
2-nm Ti adhesion layer was directly deposited on the patterned SiN

 side. After the EV assays, the metal films were removed by Au etchant
and hydrogen fluoride (HF) solutions to regenerate chips. After
cleaning the patterned Si templates, fresh metal films were deposited
on the regenerated Si templates.
NPS measurement
The fabricated Au chip was first incubated with a 1:3 mixture of 10 mM
linear polyethylene glycol (thiol-PEG-biotin, 1 kDa, Nanocs Inc., and
methyl-PEG-thiol, 0.2 kDa, Fisher Scientific Inc.) overnight at room
temperature. After washing in PBS, the chip was secondarily incubated
with neutravidin (Thermo Scientific; 50 mg/ml in PBS with 0.2% BSA)
for 40 min at room temperature. Finally, after washing, 0.5 ml of bio-
tinylated antibodies (10 mg/ml in PBS with 0.2% BSA) was added to
individual nanopore arrays by using a microarray spotter (DigiLab
Inc.) and incubated for 40 min at room temperature with humidity.
The antibody-conjugated chip was washed in PBS and then measured
with a spectrometer (USB4000-UV-VIS-ES, Ocean Optics Inc.) to
obtain a baseline spectrum.
For EV detection, EV samples (0.5 ml, in 1% BSA) were spotted onto
individual sensor arrays using the microarray spotter and incubated in
a humidity chamber for 50 min at room temperature. The chip was
washed with PBS to remove unbound EVs, and light transmission of
each nanopore array was measured. A custom-built software program
(MATLAB R2015a, MathWorks Inc.) was used to analyze spectral
shifts after EV binding. A setof control arrays with isotype control anti-
bodies was used to measure signals due to nonspecific binding; these
background signals were subtracted from the positive arrays.
Patients
Between 2015 and 2016, 135 patients underwent surgical resection of
pancreatic neoplasms or other abdominal abnormalities. Through an
Institutional Review Board–approved protocol at MGH (principal
investigator: C.F.d.C.), blood samples were acquired. All samples
were anonymized, and only age, gender, medical history, and final
pathological diagnosis were recorded. All samples were processed
by operators blinded to the sample type.
Statistics
The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to quantify the corre-
lations between different variables. Group differences were tested
using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test for two groups and
the Kruskal-Wallis test for more than two groups; P values for pairwise
comparisons were obtained using the Dunn’s multiple comparison
test. ROC curves were constructed for individual markers and selected
marker combinations todescribe the accuracy of detecting cancer. The
cutoff points were selected using Youden’s index, which maximizes
the sum of sensitivity and specificity. We used data from the training
cohort (n = 32) to select the optimal cutoff points associated with in-
dividual markers and marker combinations and then evaluated the
sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of predicting tumor status asso-
ciated with the optimal cutoff points using data from the prospective
cohort (n = 43). Selection of marker combinations was informed by
literature, biological information, and data-driven statistical proce-
dures. One set of markers was selected through fitting the least abso-
lute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) paths for regularized
logistic regression (37) to the training cohort, where the tuning
parameter was selected through a 10-fold cross-validation (38). For
marker combinations, the sums of selected markers were used to pre-
dict tumor status. Notably, although the lasso procedure suggested a
linear combination of markers with the weights being the estimated
coefficients, the uncertainty associated with these estimated coefficients
was large. We therefore used the unweighted sums for all marker com-
binations for ease of implementation in practice. CIs for AUC were
calculated using the DeLong method (39), and for the cut points,
the stratified bootstrap percentile method was used. Exact CIs for
sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were obtained on the basis of bi-
nomial distributions. All tests were two-sided, and a P value of <0.05
was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed
using R version 3.3.2 and GraphPad Prism 7.
