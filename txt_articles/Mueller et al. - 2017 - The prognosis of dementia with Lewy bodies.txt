Summary 
 
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common form of 
neurodegenerative dementia and is distinct from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in 
symptomatology and pathology. Yet little is known about its prognosis and disease 
trajectories. These issues are critical to informing clinical practice and research. The 
literature indicates a less favourable prognosis in DLB, with reported accelerated 
cognitive decline, shorter lifespan and increased nursing home admission. Healthcare 
costs are also reported to be higher in DLB than AD. Importantly, caregiver burden is 
significantly higher in DLB. It is likely that causative factors in these issues include the 
higher prevalence, and earlier emergence, of neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB and 
the challenge of accurate diagnosis. Evidence concerning quality of life and hospital 
admissions is extremely limited despite the importance of these issues.  
 
Key words: Dementia with Lewy bodies, prognosis, cognitive decline, survival, 
mortality, nursing home admission, hospitalisation, quality of life, caregiver burden,

Introduction 
 
Prognosis following a dementia diagnosis varies widely between individuals, and 
impacts considerably on the healthcare needs and future of each patient. Dementia is 
a progressive neurodegenerative condition. In its broadest sense, prognosis following 
a diagnosis of dementia includes a shortened life span, high levels of disability and 
complex care needs, leading to loss of independence and quality of life and eventual 
death. However, there are indications that different subtypes of dementia are likely to 
be associated with differing prognoses. Evaluations of prognostic factors to date have 
largely focused on either the dementia syndrome overall or Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), 
the most common cause of dementia1,2. It is important to elucidate how different 
dementia types impact on long-term health and service use in order to support 
individuals, physicians and healthcare services in managing a diagnosis of dementia. 
This issue is also key for wider societal planning for supporting people with dementia 
in the community. 
 
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common form of 
neurodegenerative dementia in people over 65. DLB accounts for 10-20% of dementia 
cases, and thus contributes substantially to the overall impact of dementia3. DLB is 
pathologically and clinically distinct from AD and other forms of dementia. 
Pathologically, DLB is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies -  intraneuronal 
inclusions consisting mainly of alpha-synuclein aggregates and ubiquitin - in the 
neocortex, forebrain, brain stem and other parts of the nervous system. Most DLB 
patients also have AD-type changes, in particular amyloid plaques. Cognitive 
  
4 
symptoms typically present as difficulties with visuospatial domains and executive 
function rather than memory. Psychiatric and behavioural features, especially 
hallucinations, sleep disturbances and apathy, are more common and frequently 
present early in the disease course2,4-6. In addition, other symptoms such as motor 
symptoms including falls, autonomic dysfunction, and fluctuating consciousness 
represent a challenge for patients, carers and the health-care system. Finally, these 
patients have a high risk of severe sensitivity reactions to antipsychotic drugs4. Despite 
these key differences in symptomatology and pathology, the evidence pertaining to 
DLB as a distinct condition is limited. This lack of clarity regarding DLB as a distinct 
condition is also reflected in the history of its clinical characterisation, which was 
hampered by conflicting evidence and complex case reports. Pivotal early research 
by Kosaka and colleagues emphasized the importance of cortical Lewy pathology as 
a substrate of dementia and began to define the core syndrome7. Subsequent work 
lead to operationalized criteria4,8 and in 2013 DLB was included Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) as "Major or Mild 
Neurocognitive Disorder with Lewy Bodies"9.  The current consortium criteria4 were 
largely followed, but the suggestive imaging feature omitted. In the the International 
Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11), bound to be published this year, is 
likely to also acknowledge DLB as a separate entity.  
There are very few randomised controlled trials of treatments in DLB and the evidence 
relating to prognosis following a diagnosis has not been fully evaluated. Prognosis in 
dementia with Lewy bodies is an area of growing research interest. Early studies relied 
on post-mortem analyses, which were hindered by small sample sizes and selection 
bias towards younger patients with atypical features or uncertain diagnosis. The 
advent of a revised consensus criteria for DLB4 and advances in imaging and other 
  
5 
biomarkers have improved diagnostic rates and paved the way for larger scale 
longitudinal studies6,10. The available evidence indicates that prognosis of DLB is 
highly variable and divergent from AD11. 
 
This review aims to present and interpret the current evidence in DLB regarding key 
prognostic measures including cognitive decline, mortality, institutionalisation and 
hospitalisation, costs, quality of life, and caregiver burden. The review is intended to 
provide an update on the likely trajectory and key issues following a diagnosis of DLB, 
and recommendations for physicians working with these patients. 
 
Cognitive decline 
Cognitive decline is inherent in all dementias but there is evidence suggesting that the 
speed and nature of decline in DLB may be distinct from AD. The direction and 
significance of any differences is not yet fully clear. Although quantification of 
fluctuations in attentional performance has been demonstrated to be a sensitive 
means of discriminating DLB from other dementias12, this may contribute to the 
inconsistent findings in cognitive testing, in particular due to the small sample sizes in 
these studies. Taken as a whole, the literature is conflicting although recent large 
studies have provided important new data. Of 20 published studies seven have 
reported an accelerated cognitive decline in DLB (Table 1). The largest of these 
included cognitive decline data for up to three years on 800 DLB patients who had 
been seen at more than 20 international centres. A more rapid average annual decline 
in MMSE score (2.1 MMSE score points per year in DLB) compared to people with AD 
(1.63 points per year; p=0.07) and Parkinson’s Disease Dementia (1.75 points per 
year; p=0.19) was observed.  This difference reached significance when baseline 
  
6 
MMSE score was accounted for10. A further recent five-year prospective cohort study 
including 67 DLB cases also reported a faster annual decline in DLB than in AD (4.4 
vs. 3.2 MSSE score points) with patients reaching a severe dementia state five months 
earlier than those with AD13. These two recent studies provide valuable large-scale 
and long-term data in the field, although it should be noted that the large study was 
based on retrospective data from different centres, and survival of participants in the 
prospective cohort study was low. The work concurs with early research in the field 
but conflicts with a previous meta-analysis of six small studies that found no difference 
in cognitive decline in DLB and AD14. This highlights the importance of prospective, 
larger, longer-term studies to examine the likely cognitive trajectory of DLB cases. The 
MMSE is a broad brush approach to cognitive assessment, and there is a need to 
consider individual cognitive domains to fully elucidate trends of cognitive decline in 
DLB. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)15, includes more executive and 
visuospatial features than the MMSE and has been demonstrated to have better 
sensitivity in both AD, DLB and PD16,17. However, the sensitivity to change in DLB has 
been reported to be similar in MoCA and MMSE18. However, subdomain-specific 
cognitive decline has rarely been assessed in DLB. The literature indicates that verbal 
fluency deteriorates faster in DLB than in AD19 and that memory, recognition and recall 
decline more slowly 20,21. Prospective studies of cognitive domains are thus needed. 
 
There is an emerging consensus for the role of concurrent pathologies in accelerated 
cognitive decline in DLB, indicating a possible continuum of trajectories dependent on 
underlying pathology. Several studies have shown faster deterioration in DLB cases 
with co-morbid AD pathology as assessed through post-mortem analyses of amyloid-
beta (A𝛽) burden22-24. A typical AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile, defined as low 
  
7 
A𝛽42 alone or in combination with elevated tau and phosphorylated tau, have been 
shown to be significantly associated with a more rapid cognitive decline in DLB 
patients25 (Figure 1), similar to findings in PD26. Interestingly, CSF changes related to 
AD have been linked to worse performance in MMSE subtests assessing temporal 
lobe function (memory and orientation scores) in DLB, indicating a role for specific 
pathology in sub-domain declines27. Further the presence of at least one 
apolipoprotein E4 allele has also been linked to a faster cognitive deterioration28,29. 
Taken together, this evidence begins to suggest that cognitive decline in DLB is likely 
to be dictated in part by concurrent AD pathology, leading to a spectrum of possible 
outcomes dependent on the individual pathological status. It is also likely that co-
morbid AD pathology leads to heterogeneity in DLB research cohorts, and may 
account for the large variation reported in DLB studies. Thus, although CSF does not 
aid in the diagnosis of DLB due to its overlap with AD30, physicians may find that CSF 
analyses provide prognostic information for individual cases. However, before this can 
be operationalised further CSF and imaging studies of amyloid and tau pathologies in 
DLB and concurrent cognitive decline are warranted.  
 
Longevity and mortality 
 
Survival of individual patients following a diagnosis of DLB is difficult to predict, 
particularly due to the frailties and co-morbidities that are common in older adults and 
which contribute to a complex risk profile for mortality. The literature shows good 
agreement on key risk factors for earlier mortality, which include male gender, higher 
age at onset, larger burden of co-morbid conditions, and functional impairment31-33. 
These factors are shared with AD and can be considered to be generic mortality risks 
  
8 
across the dementia spectrum. A number of DLB specific predictors of shorter survival 
have also been defined (Figure 2). These include gait abnormalities, fluctuating 
cognition and hallucinations early in the disease course. Use of antipsychotics may 
increase mortality in people with dementia34, and this is particularly relevant for DLB 
given the high proportion with psychosis and the risk for severe hypersensitivity 
reactions to antipsychotics. There are inconsistencies in the evidence base regarding 
the associated risk with extrapyramidal symptoms, with one study reporting a 
protective effect of when a tremor is present 31,32.  
In terms of autonomic dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension is associated with higher 
mortality in DLB patients, but constipation and urinary incontinence are not35. 
Noradrenergic cardiac denervation is a well-known feature of DLB. However, low 
cardiac MIBG uptake is not necessarily correlated with actual symptoms of autonomic 
dysfunction36,37. Parkinson’s disease has been linked to higher mortality due to 
cardiovascular events38 and prolonged QTc on electrocardiography39. These findings 
could be applicable to DLB, although the latter could not be replicated in a DLB 
sample40. More studies are needed to explore this. 
 
Autopsy studies have attempted to define survival in people with DLB, with estimates 
ranging from 1.8 to 9.5 years41,42. A meta-analysis of 150 neuropathologically 
confirmed cases of DLB showed a mean survival time after diagnosis of 6.1 years11. 
However, these figures are based on small sample sizes and so should be treated 
with caution. Of interest with regard to treatment decisions, one randomized placebo-
controlled trial of the glutamate inhibitor memantine in DLB and PDD patients showed 
a positive impact on survival43. Although this evidence is too weak to be the basis of 
treatment decision-making this finding does indicate the potential role of this treatment 
  
9 
approach in DLB and may warrant further investigation to establish the underlying 
mechanism for improved survival. Unfortunately, very few clinical trials in DLB have 
been reported, but a number are ongoing and it will be important to explore the role of 
novel treatments in long-term prognosis and survival. 
 
When considering differential survival times from diagnosis between DLB and AD 
there is an added complexity due to the challenge of obtaining an accurate DLB 
diagnosis, which increases the likelihood of a DLB diagnosis being made relatively 
later in the dementia ‘journey’ than for people with AD. Nine studies have examined 
this question, of which six report a shorter survival time in DLB compared with AD. 
whereas the remaining three showed no difference. (Table 1). Studies have defined 
survival in two ways, either from onset of disease, or from diagnosis. Survival 
estimates range between 5.5 and 7.7 years, and between 1.9 and 6.3 years 
respectively for these two definitions 22,27,32,44-46. To mitigate potential inaccuracies due 
to recall bias of duration and delay in diagnosis, Stubendorff and colleagues 45 
measured survival from fixed MMSE score points (20±1 and 17±1), demonstrating 
worse survival in DLB than in AD patients.  
 
As with cognitive decline, co-morbid AD pathology and its biomarkers are associated 
with shorter survival in DLB. Target biomarkers include the apolipoprotein E4 allele, 
lower hippocampal volume and a high level of CSF t-tau47-49. This evidence adds 
weight to the theory that concurrent DLB and AD pathology lead to a less favourable 
prognosis in DLB.

Nursing home admission 
 
Nursing home admission is an important indicator of disease progression. A move to 
permanent residential care is associated with complex and full time care needs and 
loss of independence. Importantly for healthcare services, residential care contributes 
to a vastly increased cost of care50,51. Factors that contribute to the risk of nursing 
home admission in dementia are older age, poorer cognitive and functional state, living 
alone and caregiver burden. A major trigger for institutionalisation is neuropsychiatric 
symptoms such as aggression and psychosis52, as well as motor symptoms which 
contribute to further disability.   
 
Since DLB is closely connected with hallucinations and behavioural symptoms it might 
be expected that these patients are more likely to be placed in a nursing home earlier 
than their AD counterparts. Indeed, figures for respite care placement from cross-
sectional economic studies indicate that DLB patients spent at least three times the 
number of days per year in nursing care facilities than AD patients51,53. However, 
literature pertaining to long-term placement is limited and conflicting (Table 1). One 
Scandinavian study reported that median time from mild dementia to entry into nursing 
homes was 1.8 years in DLB patients, which is two years shorter than in AD 54. 
Contributing factors are male gender and antipsychotic prescriptions, which indicates 
that neuropsychiatric symptoms are a likely common trigger. Acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitors appear to be protective54, which underscore that cholinergic deficits are a 
particular prominent feature in DLB55.  
In contrast, two further studies in the US and Japan reported no difference in nursing 
home admission between DLB and other dementia groups32,56, despite one study 
  
11 
reporting that DLB patients reached a composite endpoint (nursing home admission, 
hospitalisation or death) on average one year earlier than AD patients.  
 
Hospitalisation 
 
Admission to general hospital is a critical event for both patient and healthcare 
services. Similarly to nursing home placements, hospitalisation triggers a high cost 
profile for care and often leads to longer term placement in residential care. For people 
with dementia hospitalisation is undesirable as it is associated with a worsening of 
cognition and the emergence or worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms, which are 
often managed with antipsychotic medications 57. An additional risk in people with DLB 
is the misdiagnosis and mismanagement of delirium58. DLB typically presents with 
visual hallucinations and fluctuating attention and cognition4. This is similar to, and 
easily misinterpreted as, a hyperactive delirium or acute confusional state. One 
common pitfall lies in misdiagnosing DLB as delirium. Another is missing an acute 
underlying medical condition due to the assumption that symptoms are part of the DLB 
state. The first may lead to patients being treated with antipsychotics, with substantial 
risk of severe reactions and mortality. The later might cause inadequate investigation 
management of common causes of delirium as pain or potentially life-threatening 
conditions57-59. 
However, there is also evidence that delirium occurs particularly often in DLB, more 
so than in AD, and may even be a presenting symptom59,60. In one study 25% of DLB 
patients had an episode of delirium prior to dementia onset so it may be expected that 
DLB patients are more at risk of hospitalisation than other dementia types. Thus, 
clinicians should consider DLB as a possible differential diagnosis in patients admitted 
  
12 
with delirium. If there is a suspicion of DLB underlying a delirious episode, established 
DLB biomarkers as DaT scan or SPECT4 might be helpful to clarify diagnosis once the 
episode has resolved58.  
 
Studies examining rates of hospitalisation after diagnosis of DLB are scarce and 
sample sizes are small, so interpretation of the literature is difficult. Of three studies, 
two report a higher hospitalisation rate in DLB compared with AD, but a third study 
reported the opposite51,53,56 (Table 1). Importantly, the most common reasons for 
hospitalisation are falls and bronchopneumonia. These are recognised as the highest 
risk factors for hospital admissions across the wider frail older adult group, so this 
indicates that the general advice for falls prevention and prompt treatment for 
respiratory infection is directly applicable to DLB. 
 
Healthcare costs 
 
Dementia has a high economic impact on society and health care costs increase as 
the illness progresses and functional abilities decline. Progression to severe dementia 
and admission to nursing homes are particularly cost-intensive61,62, and there are a 
number of established predictors for increased cost, including living alone, functional 
decline and co-morbidity. Economic evaluations in dementia are complex, yet they 
provide essential information to enable decision-making in healthcare policy and to 
dictate service provision.  
 
Four studies have examined the relative costs of DLB and AD, of which three report a 
higher cost with DLB (Table 1, Figure 3). Higher costs are attributed to increased, or 
  
13 
longer-term, use of high-cost accommodation such as nursing homes, increased 
pharmacotherapy and higher utilisation of outpatient care, community services and 
informal help 51,53. Given the apparent increased risk of hospital and nursing home 
admission, these findings are not unexpected. There also appears to be a differential 
in the type of support used by people with DLB and AD, with DLB patients using more 
assistive devices and incurring higher indirect costs through informal care giving, while 
AD patients rely more on home-based healthcare 63. Interestingly, one study suggests 
that costs in DLB may not be as strongly determined by cognitive decline as in AD. 
This is likely due to the higher prevalence and earlier onset of neuropsychiatric 
symptoms, parkinsonism and other motor symptoms which may predominate in the 
cost impact of DLB. As with nursing home admission, cost savings are made when 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are prescribed in the first year after 
diagnosis64. Again, this evidence could be interpreted as an indication of a close 
relationship between institutionalization and cost of care.  
 
Quality of life 
 
Quality of life (QoL) is increasingly considered to be the most meaningful outcome 
measure for people with dementia. It is conceptually challenging, particularly when 
working with groups who have limited capacity for self-report and insight into their 
condition and day-to-day experience, but is a critical aspect of both research output 
and clinical practice65. In standardised scales QoL is consistently rated higher by 
patients than by caregiver proxy-measures. This is likely due to the disconnect caused 
by cognitive impairment, and enhanced by caregiver stress and burden 66,67. 
 
  
14 
QoL has not been fully defined in DLB, and very few trials have included it as an 
outcome. The limited literature suggests that both patient- and proxy-rated QoL is 
lower in people with DLB compared with AD68, with one study reporting 25% and 6% 
of people falling below acceptable thresholds on the EQ-5D, respectively69,70 (Table 
1). There are a number of strong candidate determinants for QoL in DLB. Causative 
factors for lower QoL include higher frequency of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as 
depression, apathy and hallucinations, in addition to the high dependency states and 
restrictions in living arrangements seen in DLB. In line with trends seen across the 
dementia spectrum, cognitive function does not correlate with QoL 65. Interestingly, 
one RCT of memantine reported a significant benefit to QoL in people with DLB and 
PDD, which was also associated with improvements in subdomains related to body 
function, physical health, energy, mood, and memory71. Demonstrating improvement 
of QoL in clinical trials is difficult but remains a priority in DLB trials. 
 
Caregiver burden 
 
DLB might be predicted to associate strongly with caregiver burden due to the specific 
spectrum of non-cognitive symptoms that impact directly on caregivers, including 
psychosis, behavioural symptoms such as aggression and agitation, and night-time 
behaviours including wandering. These aspects of dementia, which are particularly 
common in DLB, are correlated with increased levels of caregiver distress and burden, 
and are a frequently named trigger for institutionalisation across all types of 
dementia72,73. There is considerable literature describing this correlation in DLB 
groups2,74-76, with particular emphasis on anxiety, apathy, delusions and 
hallucinations2,75. A small number of studies report higher levels of caregiver burden 
  
15 
in DLB compared with AD, particularly due to the challenge of managing behavioural 
symptoms74 (Table 1). Of note, psychiatric symptoms are also related to a variety of 
parasomnias which are particularly common in DLB, and thus likely also contribute to 
carer burden54,77. The literature includes a large cross-sectional survey of carers 
conducted by the Lewy Body Dementia Association, which highlighted the role of 
Activities of Daily Living as a potentially major factor in caregiver burden. Carers 
reported that over 90% of LBD patients were unable to perform complex tasks and 
over 60% needed support with basic activities of daily living78. This is in agreement 
with other studies, and implies that motor symptoms also contribute, although there is 
a lack of agreement regarding the scale of impact of functional impairment75,76. Thus, 
clinicians need to carefully consider depression and exhaustion in those caring for 
people with DLB, as well as their need for information and support. In a UK survey 
largely completed by spouses or first degree relatives, the support need most 
frequently identified related to hallucinations. The importance of explaining what Lewy 
body disease is, its pathophysiology and the impact on the brain and body as a whole 
was highlighted79.  
 
Recommendations 
 
There are varying levels of evidence supporting different aspects of prognosis for DLB, 
and much of the literature is drawn from small, single-centre studies. An inherent 
challenge in DLB research is the issue of diagnostic accuracy, differentiating DLB from 
AD and from Parkinson’s disease dementia, and the lack of pathological confirmation 
of diagnosis in addition to the lack of clarity around disease trajectory in these patients, 
although dopamine transporter SPECT and other biomarkers may help in addition to 
  
16 
actively applying the diagnostic criteria. Despite this, the literature leads to a number 
of conclusions that are evidence-based.  
 
There is a clear message that DLB carries a poorer prognosis, defined as increased 
cost profile, accelerated nursing home admission and shorter time to death.  Key 
questions that remain relate to the elucidation of which clinical and pathological 
features contribute to these poorer outcomes and which are the biggest priority as 
targets for intervention.  Motor symptoms, cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric 
symptoms are all likely to contribute in some way, but we would suggest that the 
particularly high frequency of neuropsychiatric symptom in these individuals, such as 
psychosis and depression, highlights these as particularly important treatment targets.  
 
Although the existing data is less clear-cut there is also a suggestion of accelerated 
cognitive decline, greater caregiver burden and possibly a greater impact on quality of 
life in DLB patients. These should be taken into account by physicians when 
considering long-term support, treatment and care (Figure 4). 
 
Although DLB is the second most common form of neurodegenerative dementia, it has 
received only a fraction of the research investment and focus. There are currently no 
licensed therapies for cognition or neuropsychiatric symptoms in Europe, no 
established evidence-based non-pharmacological interventions and a paucity of new 
intervention studies. The poor prognosis and high personal and financial cost make 
new treatments studies in DLB an urgent priority. 
 
 
  
17 
Conclusions and future perspectives 
 
Research on prognosis in dementia with Lewy bodies indicates important differences 
in disease trajectories and prognosis compared to other forms of dementia, suggesting 
that key prognostic features such as survival and cognitive decline are less favourable 
in DLB than in AD. Accordingly, these patients need specialized care and more 
frequent monitoring. Despite this, there are few studies on key outcomes, and no 
licensed therapies. Analysis of the quality of studies published to date shows a lack of 
high quality design, which limits the interpretation that can be made from much of 
literature at present (Table 1). This underlines the importance of larger scale studies 
on prognosis in DLB, in which multinational research co-operations or electronic health 
record databases could play an important role. The existing evidence also underlines 
the need for well-defined DLB cohorts, potentially through a combination of 
neuroimaging, genetic profiling and biomarker analysis, to reduce heterogeneity in 
clinical trials.

Search strategy and selection criteria 
This review was informed by a systematic literature search performed on 1st August 
2016. The electronic database PubMed was searched for articles published between 
1st January 1990 and 31st July 2016 with the search terms “Lewy body OR Lewy bodies 
OR DLB OR LBD” and “cognition OR cognitive decline OR survival OR mortality OR 
nursing home admission OR hospitalization OR cost OR quality of life OR QOL OR 
carer OR caregiver”. References from the identified articles were also scrutinised for 
relevant studies. There were no language restrictions. Articles were selected through 
author consensus with a focus on longitudinal studies. Studies were scored for quality 
using a system based on a previous review 14. Maximum score was 6 and based on 
two subscales: number DLB participants at baseline (more than 90 = 3, 61-90 = 2, 31-
60 = 1, 30 or less = 0) and the follow-up time (more than 3 years = 3, up to 3 years = 
2, up to 2 years = 1, 1 year or less = 0). To illustrate differences between the included 
studies we devised a traffic light system (5-6 = green; 3-4 = yellow; 2 or less = red).

• 
Cognitive decline at least as 
rapid as in AD 
• 
Possibly following a different 
pattern than AD, which 
composite cognitive scores 
might not be able to detect 
• 
Co-morbid AD seems to 
predict faster decline 
 
 
• 
Subdomain specific decline 
needed as current memory 
tests do not capture executive 
and visuospatial decline 
accurately (MoCA needs 
further evaluation as potential 
tool) 
• 
AD patients with symptoms 
suggestive of DLB might need 
more intense diagnostic to 
identify co-morbid DLB as this 
has substantial impact on 
prognosis

• 
Age of onset appears to be 
similar in AD and DLB 
• 
Survival seems to be shorter 
in DLB 
• 
Survival time in DLB varies 
between 1.9 to 6.3 years after 
diagnosis 
• 
AD cohorts report 3.2 to 6.6 
years after diagnosis

• 
Time to nursing home 
admission between 1.8 and 
6.1 years in DLB 
• 
Nursing home admission 
occurs between 6 months 
and 1.8 years earlier in DLB 
than AD 
• 
Predictors: self-reported 
depressive symptoms, 
extrapyramidal signs, longer 
duration of symptoms, 
antipsychotic use, AChEI 
prescription (protective) 
 
• 
Due to high economic impact 
more research needed into 
factors predicting nursing home 
admission

• 
Economic analyses had 
contradictory results 
• 
DLB patients had between 
10.3 and 4.1 days of hospital 
care per year 
• 
AD patients between 1.6 and 
6.1 days of hospital care per 
year 
 
• 
More research needed into 
burden of hospitalization in 
DLB  
• 
As hospitalization is potentially 
more harmful for DLB than AD 
patients, more research 
needed into factors leading to 
hospitalization

• 
Cost in DLB about twice as

• 
No difference if only 
community-dwelling patients 
• 
Nursing home admission 
appears to major cost factor 
and cost difference factor 
• 
Underlines importance of 
researching factors predicting 
nursing home admission in 
DLB

• 
Higher carer stress in DLB 
consistently reported 
• 
Correlated with 
neuropsychiatric symptoms  
• 
Differing results regarding 
correlation of functional 
difficulties and carers stress 
 
• 
Highlights the need to find 
novel ways to address 
neuropsychiatric symptoms in 
DLB  
• 
Further the link between factors 
influencing carers stress, and 
risk of residential placement 
warrant further investigation
