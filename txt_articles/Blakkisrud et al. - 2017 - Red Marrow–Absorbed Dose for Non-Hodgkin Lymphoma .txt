Red marrow (RM) is often the primary organ at risk in radioimmuno-
therapy; irradiation of marrow may induce short- and long-term
hematologic toxicity. 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan is a novel anti-
CD37 antibody–radionuclide conjugate currently in phase 1/2a. Two
predosing regimens have been investigated, one with 40 mg of un-
labeled lilotomab antibody (arm 1) and one without (arm 2). The aim of
this work was to compare RM-absorbed doses for the two arms and
to correlate absorbed doses with hematologic toxicity. Methods:
Eight patients with relapsed CD371 indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin
lymphoma were included for RM dosimetry. Hybrid SPECT and CT
images were used to estimate the activity concentration in the RM
of L2–L4. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated after mea-
surement of the 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan concentration in blood
samples. Adverse events were graded according to the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Results:
The mean absorbed doses to RM were 0.9 mGy/MBq for arm 1
(lilotomab1) and 1.5 mGy/MBq for arm 2 (lilotomab2). There was
a statistically significant difference between arms 1 and 2 (Student
t test, P 5 0.02). Total RM-absorbed doses ranged from 67 to
127 cGy in arm 1 and from 158 to 207 cGy in arm 2. For blood,
the area under the curve was higher with lilotomab predosing than
without (P 5 0.001), whereas the volume of distribution and the
clearance of 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan was significantly lower
(P 5 0.01 and P 5 0.03, respectively). Patients with grade 3/4
thrombocytopenia had received significantly higher radiation doses
to RM than patients with grade 1/2 thrombocytopenia (P 5 0.02). A
surrogate, non–imaging-based, method underestimated the RM
dose and did not show any correlation with toxicity. Conclusion:
Predosing with lilotomab reduces the RM-absorbed dose for
177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan patients. The decrease in RM dose
could be explained by the lower volume of distribution. Hematologic
toxicity was more severe for patients receiving higher absorbed ra-
diation doses, indicating that adverse events possibly can be pre-
dicted by the calculation of absorbed dose to RM from SPECT/CT
images.

Radioimmunotherapy, or antibody–radionuclide conjugate (ARC)
therapy, uses targeting antibodies linked to a radionuclide, and ARC
therapy based on CD20-specific antibodies has been routinely
used for treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 177Lu-lilotomab
satetraxetan (previously referred to as 177Lu-DOTA-HH1; trade
name, Betalutin [Nordic Nanovector]) is a novel ARC that targets
the CD37 antigen expressed on malignant B cells (1). Myelosup-
pression is the main adverse effect of the CD20-based ARC therapies
131I-tositumomab (Bexxar; GlaxoSmithKline) and 90Y-ibritumomab-
tiuxetan (Zevalin; Spectrum Pharmaceuticals) and is widely regarded
to be a consequence of marrow irradiation (2,3). ARCs composed of
a CD37 antibody labeled with 131I and a CD20 antibody labeled with
177Lu have also demonstrated hematologic toxicity (4,5). Estimating
the absorbed dose to the RM is therefore an imperative when a new
ARC is studied. Preclinical studies and preliminary phase 1/2a clin-
ical results indicate that myelosuppression is dosage-limiting also for
177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan (6,7).
The distributed nature of the marrow, intricate microstructure, and
dependence on sex and age result in dosimetric challenges. Extensive
work has resulted in calculation of S values for the skeleton, making
dosimetry in accordance with the MIRD scheme possible (8). A
requirement is then to estimate the activity concentration both in
the RM itself and in the surrounding tissues contributing to crossfire
dose (9). An indirect measuring procedure for RM itself has tradi-
tionally been the method of choice, with blood doses being used as a
surrogate. There is a growing consensus that this surrogate is sub-
optimal for ARC therapy dose estimation, mainly given the often-
observed lack of correlation with toxicity and deviations found when
compared with direct imaging methods (10–12). Through imaging
of uptake in marrow itself, correlations have been found between
absorbed dose and toxic effects (10,11,13), and this correlation is
better with 3-dimensional modalities such as SPECT or PET than
with planar imaging (14).
Predosing with unlabeled antibody on the same day as dosing
with the radioactive antibody has been shown to be effective at

 blocking accessible noncancerous B cells from treatment with
131I-tositumomab (15,16). In the present phase 1/2a trial, only
patients in arm 1 received predosing with lilotomab. In addition,
all patients were pretreated with a larger amount of the anti-
CD20 antibody rituximab before 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan
injection.
The aim of this work was to calculate RM doses using SPECT/
CT images of patients receiving treatment with 177Lu-lilotomab
satetraxetan and investigate whether predosing with unlabeled
lilotomab affects the RM dose. We also investigated the correla-
tion between absorbed doses to RM and hematologic toxicity
measured by reduction in thrombocytes and neutrophils.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Eight patients with relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma
treated in the phase 1 LYMRIT-37-01 trial were included for RM
dosimetry. All patents had received prior chemotherapy (Table 1).
Patients with prior external-beam radiation therapy to L2–L4 were
excluded. The study was approved by the regional ethical committee,
and all patients gave written informed consent. The participants re-
ceived a single injection of 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan and were
pretreated with the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (375 mg/m2) at 4
wk and 3 wk before injection. In arm 1 the patients received predosing
with 40 mg of lilotomab before administration of 177Lu-lilotomab sate-
traxetan, and in arm 2 they did not.
Hematologic Analyses
Blood samples were collected before administration of 177Lu-
lilotomab satetraxetan, several times on day 0, once on each of days
1, 2, 3, 4, and 7, every week thereafter until week 4, and then every
6 mo. The blood samples from the first month were decay-corrected
to yield time–activity concentration curves. AUCblood, clearance,
and volume of distribution were found analytically after monoex-
ponential curve fitting.
The decrease in thrombocytes and neutrophils at nadir relative to
baseline was calculated. Hematologic adverse events (thrombocyto-
penia and neutropenia) were graded by the Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0 (17).
Image Acquisition and Probe Measurements
The SPECT/CT imaging protocol has been described previously
(1). In brief, attenuation- and scatter-corrected SPECT/CT images
were acquired approximately 96 and 168 h after injection of 177Lu-
lilotomab satetraxetan. Patients 13–15 underwent an additional scan
24 h after injection. Whole-body activity half-lives were determined
by anterior and posterior probe measurements at a fixed distance from
the patients, at the height of the sternum. The first measurement was
performed before the patients voided, within 5 min after injection.
Additional measurements were performed 10 min after injection and
4, 24, 96, and 196 h after injection.
Quantification and Dosimetry
Absorbed dose to RM was found both by a surrogate method, using
blood and whole-body measurements, and by a method based on
SPECT/CT images. The surrogate method was primarily performed
for comparison purposes. Both methods include a contribution from
the RM itself (self-dose) and a contribution from the remainder of the
body (cross-dose). The time-integrated activity coefficient for the
remainder of the body is

curves, and were integrated analytically. When patient-specific probe
measurements was not available, a mean tWBðpatientÞ was used.
SPECT/CT Method
Vertebrae L2–L4 were chosen to quantify activity using SPECT/
CT images as previously described for tumors (1). The mass of the
marrow in L2–L4 was estimated for each patient by drawing a vol-
ume of interest defining the interior space of the corpus vertebrae.
This volume, VL22L4ðpatientÞ, mainly consists of RM, yellow marrow,
and trabecular bone. Activity in trabecular bone was assumed to be
zero, and a multiplicative correction factor, 1 2 fTB, was applied to
the interior volume. The factor fTB was assumed to be 0.135 for male
patients and 0.148 for female patients (18). The rest of VL22L4ðpatientÞ
was assumed to be RM. The RM activity concentration in L2–L4
is then

with AL22L4ðpatientÞ being the activity in L2–L4.
Activity concentration points were fitted by monoexponential curves
and integrated analytically, resulting in the RM cumulative activity in
L2–L4, ~
AL22L4ðpatientÞ. The L2–L4 RM time-integrated activity coeffi-
cient and the L2–L4 RM mass, tL22L4ðpatientÞ and mL22L4ðpatientÞ, can
then be written as

and

with A0ðpatientÞ being administered activity.
It was assumed that cumulative concentrations were equal
throughout the marrow and that L2–L4 accounted for 6.7% of total
RM. Therefore, both mL22L4ðpatientÞ and tL22L4ðpatientÞ were scaled by
1/0.067 (19). These parameters, together with tRBðpatientÞ, were used
as input to OLINDA/EXM, resulting in the image-derived RM
dose, or DRMðSPECTÞ (20).
Surrogate Method
The surrogate RM dosimetry is based on the assumption that the
cumulative concentration in RM is proportional to that in blood (21).
The cumulative concentration in blood is derived from AUCblood.

whole RM mass with reference RM, reference whole-body mass,

Reference values for whole body and RM were taken from OLINDA/
EXM for male and female phantoms. tRMðpatientÞ, tRBðpatientÞ, and
mRMðpatientÞ were used as input in OLINDA/EXM, resulting in dose
to RM, or DRMðsurrogateÞ.
Statistics
The mean RM dose for arms 1 and 2 was compared using a 2-sided
Student t test. AUCblood, volume of distribution, and clearance from
the blood measurements were also compared for arms 1 and 2 using
the same test. The difference in RM dose between the grade 1/2 group
and the grade 3/4 group was investigated by a 2-sided Student t test.
The Pearson test was used to check for correlation between individual
RM doses and thrombocyte and neutrophil values at nadir. DRMðSPECTÞ
and DRMðsurrogateÞ were compared with a paired Student t test. For all
statistical tests, a significance level of 0.05 was used.
RESULTS
Dosimetry was primarily performed using SPECT/CT im-
ages; Figure 1 shows SPECT/CT images of the L1–L5 vertebrae
of two of the patients. The RM-absorbed dose ranged from 67 to
207 cGy, and even though the patients had been treated with
different dose levels (10 or 15 MBq/kg), every patient with
predosing received a lower absorbed dose than any patient with-
out predosing (Table 2). The contribution from cross-dose to the
total RM dose was 17% maximum for the SPECT/CT-based
method. Therefore, introducing the scaling factor 0.067 shifted
the final RM-absorbed doses by less than 2%. Figure 2 illus-
trates the RM doses separated with regard to predosing with
lilotomab (corresponding to arms 1 and 2). The mean dose for
the predosed group, 0.9 mGy/MBq, was significantly lower than
the mean dose for the group without predosing, 1.5 mGy/MBq
(P 5 0.02).
Patients with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia received a signifi-
cantly higher RM-absorbed dose than patients with grade 1/2
(P 5 0.02) (Fig. 3A). Two of the patients, both in arm 2, expe-
rienced grade 4 thrombocytopenia 3–6 wk after injection. The

 was not statistically significant (P 5 0.39) (Fig. 3B). There was a
moderate, but nonsignificant, linear correlation between the rela-
tive reduction in thrombocyte and neutrophil counts at nadir and
the RM dose (P 5 0.10 and P 5 0.11, respectively) (Figs. 3C and
3D). The CTCAE grade reflects the absolute cell count at nadir.
When calculating the correlation between the absolute thrombo-
cyte count and RM dose, a strong and significant linear relation-
ship was found (r 5 20.74, P 5 0.04). A moderate to strong but
nonsignificant relationship was found for neutrophils (r 5
20.63, P 5 0.09).
A higher AUCblood was observed with lilotomab predosing than
without (P 5 0.001) (Table 3). The volume of distribution and the
clearance of 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan were significantly lower
for patients given lilotomab than for those not given lilotomab
(P 5 0.01 and P 5 0.03, respectively).
The surrogate method resulted in a significant underestimation
of RM dose compared with the SPECT/CT-derived dose (P 5
0.002). The relative difference ranged from 80% to 638%. RM
dose calculated by the surrogate method did not show any corre-
lation with hematologic toxicity (Fig. 4).
DISCUSSION
RM is one of the most radiation-sensitive organs in the body. In
this work, we have calculated the RM doses and correlated them to
hematologic adverse events for 8 patients treated with 177Lu-lilotomab
satetraxetan.
The RM doses were significantly higher for arm 2 (lilotomab2)
than for arm 1 (lilotomab1). This difference indicates that predos-
ing with lilotomab will have a protective effect on RM, most likely
because the unlabeled antibody blocks binding to CD37 in the RM.
The activity in blood, AUCblood, was higher and the volume of
distribution and clearance were lower for arm 1 than for arm 2,
likely because of binding of unlabeled lilotomab to CD37 ex-
pressed on cells in the highly perfused compartment, including
peripheral blood and RM. This binding by lilotomab to the readily
accessible CD37 target antigens then prevents 177Lu-lilotomab
satetraxetan from binding to the cells in this compartment, increas-
ing the concentration in the blood, reducing the available volume of
distribution, and eventually resulting in reduced amounts of radio-
activity in RM. There is a risk that predosing with cold antibody
could block the CD37 antigen on tumor tissues as well, but there
was no difference in the tumor-absorbed dose between arms 1 and
2 (1). This finding might be explained by the reduced distribution
volume and clearance in arm 1, because it implies that the concen-
tration of 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan was higher for arm 1 pa-
tients than for arm 2 patients and the increased concentration will
counteract an eventual blocking of CD37 in tumor tissue. The com-
bined findings of these works recommend use of predosing with
lilotomab before treatment with 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan. The
optimal amount of unlabeled antibody has yet to be investigated.
Although the numbers of patients are limited, a clear tendency
toward increasing RM dose with patient dose (10 vs. 15 MBq/kg,
Table 2) can be seen for each arm. This is in accordance with our
finding that absorbed dose in tumors significantly increased with
patient dosage level (1).
The overall RM dose range was 0.64–1.82 mGy/MBq. This range
is of the same order of magnitude as the RM doses listed in the
package inserts for 90Y-ibritumomab-tiuxetan and 131I-tositumomab
FIGURE 2.
RM dose was significantly lower for 177Lu-lilotomab sate-
traxetan patients in arm 1 than for those in arm 2. Patients in arm

tients in arm 2 did not. Absorbed dose is normalized for administered

 (22,23). Somewhat varying 90Y-ibritumomab-tiuxetan RM doses
have been reported, possibly because substitute radioligands have
been used for planar imaging and dosimetry (24,25). For 131I-
tositumomab, the dose is adjusted to produce a 0.75-Gy whole-body
dose, shown to correspond to SPECT/CT-derived RM doses of no
higher than 1.9 Gy and a median of 1.56 Gy with typical dosage
(26). Here, RM-absorbed doses for 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan are
demonstrated to be in accordance with typical dose ranges reported
for other ARC treatments.
Clear relationships between RM doses and hematologic toxicity
for ARC therapies have traditionally been difficult to establish,
and possible explanations include heterogeneous patient groups
and dosimetric methodology. In our study, patients developing
grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia had received significantly higher
RM doses than the grade 1/2 group. For the group-level
neutropenia analysis the difference was not significant, and a
larger number of patients should be investigated. The need for a
larger number is also demonstrated by the absolute neutrophil
count and RM dose statistical analyses
(P 5 0.09). Prior chemotherapy, limiting
the RM reserve, can also alter the relation-
ship between RM dose and hematologic
toxicity (27). All patients in our study
had undergone prior chemotherapy, with
the number of previous treatments ranging
considerably (Table 1). Although the lim-
ited number of patients prevents quantita-
tive analyses regarding the influence of
prior treatments, our findings suggest that
the dose–toxicity relationship also de-
pends on the extent of prior chemother-
apy. For example, patient 2 had received
the most extensive prior treatment, possi-
bly leading to a reduced marrow reserve
and explaining the unexpected grade 3 neu-
tropenia after an RM dose of only 67 cGy.
In contrast, patient 15, who received an RM
dose of 159 cGy, experienced only minor
hematologic toxicity. This well-tolerated
RM radiation could potentially be ex-
plained by the relatively limited prior
treatment with only one chemotherapy
regime.
Our RM dose calculation relies on the
assumption that L2–L4 is representative of
the whole marrow. This part of the skeleton
has frequently been used, and the resulting
doses have shown a correlation with hema-
tologic toxicity (11,12,19). Ideally, analyses of all skeletal sites
containing RM would strengthen the dosimetry; visual inspection
of the SPECT/CT images did, however, suggest similar uptake in
other skeletal sites, such as the costae, sacrum, sternum, and ilium.
A 2-point dosimetry model was used to avoid introducing system-
atic errors. An additional time point was available for two patients
(patients 13 and 14), and calculations for these 3-point curves dem-
onstrated a low relative difference in RM dose (0% and 8%). For
other radionuclide treatments, it has been suggested that calculation
of RM doses should be based on the radioactivity concentration in
blood, and this method is sometimes also erroneously used to esti-
mate doses for ARCs with specific RM binding. Assuming a con-
servative estimate of equal activity concentration in blood and RM,
we found doses that were between 80% and 638% lower than the
SPECT/CT-derived RM doses and no correlation with toxicity (Fig.
4). This finding clearly shows that this surrogate method should
not be used to calculate RM doses for patients treated with 177Lu-
lilotomab satetraxetan. However, a seemingly inverse proportionality

 between AUCblood itself and RM dose suggests that alternative
models for linking AUCblood and RM dose can possibly be de-
veloped.
The reduction in cell count relative to baseline is commonly
used to evaluate RM dose against toxicity (11,13,28,29). When
extrapolating the regression curve in Figures 3C and 3D, we found
a 100% reduction of both thrombocytes and neutrophils at 2–3 Gy.
Although our data suggest linear regression, sigmoidal fits have
been demonstrated in other works, and this 100% reduction
dose value should be considered an estimate (29). This is fur-
ther supported by the range in prior chemotherapies for the
patient population; this variation can preclude trends for differ-
ent patient groups. The two patients in our study who expe-
rienced grade 4 thrombocytopenia (patients 13 and 14) had
received the highest RM doses and were also the only patients
receiving an RM dose higher than 1.8 Gy. The widely used 2-Gy
dose limit for RM was initially determined for treatment of
differentiated thyroid cancer using 131I in the early 1960s (30).
Later, it was suggested that the potential differences in biologic
and physical factors (e.g., dose rate and electron energy) demon-
strate a need for empiric determination of dose limits for other
novel therapies. Our results support an RM-absorbed dose limit
of approximately 2 Gy for patients treated with 177Lu-lilotomab
satetraxetan.
CONCLUSION
Although predosing with 40 mg of unlabeled lilotomab
significantly reduced the RM-absorbed dose for patients treated
with 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan, the tumor-absorbed dose was
not affected by this amount of unlabeled antibody. These find-
ings support the use of predosing with lilotomab before 177Lu-
lilotomab satetraxetan treatment and encourage investigations
on the optimal predose, which currently are ongoing. Hemato-
logic toxicity was more severe for patients receiving higher
absorbed radiation doses, and our results indicate an RM-
absorbed dose limit of about 2 Gy for 177Lu-lilotomab satetrax-
etan therapy. Given the extent of prior chemotherapy for the
population, a somewhat higher dose limit can be expected for
patients without such treatment. A surrogate method based
on blood sampling instead of imaging demonstrated severe
shortcomings for 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan treatment. The
calculation of RM-absorbed dose, based on SPECT/CT at ap-
proximately days 4 and 7, can possibly predict adverse events
weeks before they occur. In our experience, such calculations
can be performed by trained and prepared
personnel within 2 d of the imaging.

Lack of correlation between RM dose derived by surrogate method and reduction in
thrombocyte (A) and neutrophil (B) counts demonstrates that this non–imaging-based method is
unfit to predict marrow toxicity for 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan therapy.
