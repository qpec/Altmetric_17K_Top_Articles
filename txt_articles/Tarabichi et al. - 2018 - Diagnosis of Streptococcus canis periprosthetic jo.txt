A 62-year-old man who had undergone a primary knee arthroplasty 3 years earlier, presented to the
emergency department with an infected prosthesis. He underwent prosthesis resection. All cultures
failed to identify the infecting organism. Analysis of the intraoperative samples by next-generation
sequencing revealed Streptococcus canis (an organism that resides in the oral cavity of dogs). It was
later discovered that the patient had sustained a dog scratch injury several days earlier. The patient
reports that his dog had licked the scratch. Treatment was delivered based on the sensitivity of S. canis,
and the patient has since undergone reimplantation arthroplasty.

Introduction
The diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) continues to
challenge the medical community. The lack of a “gold standard” test
compels clinicians to rely on several tests, none of which have
absolute accuracy. Despite efforts to improve the diagnosis of PJI,
such as those proposed by the International Consensus Meeting [1],
some challenges have proven insurmountable. Culture-negative PJI
(CN-PJI) in particular, is one such issue, as the inability to isolate the
infecting organism using conventional culture may cast doubt over
the diagnosis, and cause uncertainty regarding optimal treatment
[2]. The inability to isolate an organism leaves patients at the mercy
of empiric antimicrobial therapy, and the potential failure to cover
the infecting organism, thereby jeopardizing the outcome of
treatment. There is currently no clear protocol for the management
of patients with CN-PJI. Current recommendations state that
patients with CN-PJI should receive antimicrobials covering the
most common pathogens for PJI without committing to a specific
protocol [3]. The fact that PJI can be caused by fungi and atypical
organisms leaves infectious disease specialists to “best guess” the
antimicrobial regimen for CN-PJI patients. This can lead to the true
infecting organisms not being covered or indeed the administration
of unnecessary antimicrobials, thus compromising the outcome of
treatment and imparting adverse effects on patients. Considering
the fact that the incidence of CN-PJI can reach 50% in some studies
[4-8], this clinical situation is encountered commonly. Without
knowing the infective organism, clinicians are unable to effectively
monitor patients' response to treatment and determine if the
infection has been controlled. In addition, some patients could
suffer the psychological trauma of whether a joint infection existed
in the first place that necessitated multiple surgical procedures and
long-term antimicrobial treatment. This situation is not acceptable
in modern-day medicine and further innovations are needed to
address this issue in orthopaedics and other medical fields
involving the use of implants and biofilm formation.
This case highlights the challenge of CN-PJI and provides an
encouraging
endorsement
for
the
potential
of
molecular
diagnostics, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), in identi-
fying infecting organisms in PJI. It further corroborates the belief
that organisms from sources such as pets can result in PJI.

 Case history
A 62-year-old male was transferred to our institution after
presenting to an outside hospital with an infected left total knee
arthroplasty and systemic sepsis. The patient had undergone an
uncomplicated total knee arthroplasty 3 years earlier. On arrival at
the outside institution, aspiration of the knee was performed. The
analysis of the synovial fluid revealed a nucleated cell count of
63,700 cells/mL with a 90% neutrophil differential. The serological
markers of infection were elevated with an erythrocyte sedimen-
tation rate of 82 mm/h and a C-reactive protein of 6.2 mg/dL. The
result of laboratory investigations and clinical examination led the
physicians at the outside institution to reach a diagnosis of PJI. At
the family's request, he was transferred to our institution for
definitive care of the infected knee after stabilization. On his arrival
at our institution, the left knee was found to be swollen, warm, with
erythema of the overlying skin, and painful range of motion.
Radiographs showed soft tissue swelling, with arthroplasty com-
ponents in good position, and no evidence of fracture or loosening
(Fig. 1).
In
light
of
the
clinical
evaluation
and
laboratory
investigations, which met the International Consensus Meeting
criteria for the diagnosis of PJI [1], the patient was scheduled to
undergo resection of the infected knee. Subsequently, the patient
developed
hypotension,
hypoxia,
and
atrial
fibrillation,
thus
necessitating intubation. In view of the systemic illness, the patient
was started on empiric therapy with intravenous piperacillin/
tazobactam and vancomycin before surgery. Synovial fluid obtained
intraoperatively was sent for analysis, including culture, in addition
to performing the leukocyte esterase test in the operating room,
which produced a trace result [9]. At the time of debridement,
tissue samples were also obtained from the knee, and sent for
routine culture and NGS at PathoGenius Laboratory (Lubbock, TX).
Samples obtained for culture and NGS included synovial fluid,
synovium, and tissue from the femur and tibia. All 4 samples were
sent for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast cul-
tures. Bacterial cultures were held for 14 days, whereas fungal and
acid-fast cultures were held for 29 and 44 days, respectively.
Culture results of the synovial fluid at the outside institution, the
synovial fluid obtained at our institution, and the periarticular
tissues of the infected knee retrieved intraoperatively were all
culture negative. Although the patient received systemic antibiotics
on arrival at our institution, which is known to result in the inability
to isolate the infective agent in PJI [10], the synovial fluid aspiration
at the outside institution was obtained before administration of any
antibiotics. Blood cultures obtained both at our institution and the
referring institution, which were taken before antibiotic adminis-
tration, were also negative.
NGS analysis of the fluid and periarticular tissues all revealed
Streptococcus canis, an oral pathogen in dogs, cats, and cattle
(Fig. 2). It was later discovered that the patient had sustained a
scratch from his pet dog, and was continuously licked by the dog,
several days before developing the knee infection.
NGS is a well-established molecular technique that involves
amplification of microbial DNA using polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) and subsequent sequencing of all the amplicons. The test is
performed in 2 steps, with the first being a PCR to amplify the
sequence of interest and subsequently sequencing the amplicons
from that PCR. In this specific assay, the rRNA gene is amplified and
sequenced. The 2 regions of interest for detection of bacterial and
fungal species are
the 16S and internal transcribed
spacer
sequences, respectively [11,12]. These 2 sequences are both highly
conserved and variable regions of the rRNA gene, allowing for
specific microbial identification.
Based on NGS results, S. canis was found to be sensitive to
vancomycin, and hence piperacillin/tazobactam was discontinued.
It should be noted that the sensitivities provided by the results of
NGS assay are projections based on the presence of antibacterial
resistance genes and not a “true” sensitivity determined based on
the growth of the organism. Because of his systemic sepsis, the
patient had a difficult postoperative recovery, which was compli-
cated by pneumonia, placement of a tracheostomy after failing to
wean off ventilation, and was finally discharged to a rehabilitation
facility. The patient completed a 6-week course of intravenous
vancomycin followed by a 2-week antibiotic holiday, with moni-
toring of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. We
do not routinely aspirate patients before reimplantation at our
institution. At the time of reimplantation, synovial fluid and tissue
samples were obtained and sent for culture and NGS in a similar
fashion to that performed at the first stage. Both NGS and culture
from the reimplantation procedure were negative. At his 6-month
follow-up visit, the patient was walking with a cane and did not
show any clinical signs of infection.
Discussion
Culture-negative infections in general, and PJI in particular,
continue to challenge the medical community. Infections associ-
ated with implants, such as prosthetic joints, are known to exist as
biofilms, which cannot easily be identified using conventional
culture. Although numerous strategies for improving the yield of
culture have been proposed, including withholding of antibiotics
before taking culture samples [2], culturing synovial fluid in blood
culture bottles [13] and holding cultures for longer periods,
inability to isolate the infecting organism associated with implants
is common. The incidence of CN-PJI at our institution is currently
28%. This is in line with the reported rate of CN-PJI, which can range
between 27% and 55% [4-8].
There are numerous issues with the use of conventional cultures
in modern medicine. Based on the recommendations of the Infec-
tious Disease Society of America and the American Society for
Microbiology [14], samples obtained for culture need to be trans-
ported in a specific fashion, and processed within 2 hours, which is
difficult to implement in clinical practice. The conventional culture
methods that were developed in the late 19th century also rely on a
medium to grow the infecting organism. Although the latter may be
possible with acute infections, most chronic infections, particularly
those associated with biofilms, are difficult to grow using conven-
tional culture [15]. In addition, the use of selective media may allow
for preferential growth of one organism, that may not be the true
pathogen, whereas suppressing the growth of other organisms. The

 shortfalls of conventional culture, particularly in relation to PJI, call
for innovative techniques to overcome the high rate of culture-
negative infections and also explore the possibility that infections
in general, and PJI in particular, may be polymicrobial in nature.
Several culture-independent methods have been studied to
address the aforementioned issue. The use of PCR for the diagnosis
of PJI was first described at our institution in 1996 [16]. Numerous
other studies have since evaluated the role of conventional and
other PCR techniques [5,7,17,18]. One of the issues related to the use
of molecular techniques relates to the potential for isolation of a
“contaminating” organism that is not a true pathogen [19]. A prior
study raised concerns regarding the issue of false-positive results
that seemed to occur commonly using multiplex PCR [20]. In that
study, tissue samples obtained from 7 patients undergoing primary
knee replacement with no prior surgery in the affected knee, 5 of
which revealed an organism. The other issue with conventional or
multiplex PCR is the need to know the profile of potential patho-
gens to allow for the design of primers for amplification. The
technique, thus, fails to identify organisms that were not included
in the amplification panel [21]. As demonstrated by this case, as
well as those in the literature, any organism may be a potential
pathogen for PJI, and hence may be missed by molecular techniques
such as PCR.
One of the key issues facing PCR, as well as other molecular
methods, is determining the material that contains pathogen DNA
while minimizing amplification of DNA from contaminant organ-
isms. The data regarding this is conflicting. A study by Rak et al., in
which a multiplex PCR assay was used to compare the yield of
tissue to sonication fluid, demonstrated that sonication fluid was
superior to PCR in isolation of the “infecting” organism [22]. In
contrast, a meta-analysis by Qu et al. concluded that tissue samples
to be a better source for isolating the infecting organism and the
least likely to be affected by previous treatment [23].
NGS is a well-established technique for amplification and
sequencing of DNA material from any source. With the advances
being made in the field of genomics and the declining expense
associated with genomic analysis, NGS appears to be an appealing
molecular technique in identifying infecting organisms. NGS is
being applied with increasing frequency to determine the causative
agents in infections. Perhaps isolation of leptospirosis using NGS,
and the dramatic subsequent improvement in care, of a 14-year-old
comatose boy in whom the infective agent could not be isolated by
the culture is a testimony to the need for better methods of path-
ogen isolation [24]. An ongoing study to evaluate the role of NGS is
being conducted at our institution, with encouraging preliminary
results. Another potential application for NGS is polymicrobial PJI.
Given the quantitative results the test can provide, better insight
can be obtained into polymicrobial infections. Treatment of poly-
microbial infection has been shown to have lower success rates
when compared with monomicrobial infection [25], and a better

 understanding of these infections is needed to determine if they are
truly polymicrobial in nature, or rather an infection with a domi-
nant organism with other organisms acting in concert.
Summary
With all the challenges facing the medical community in
isolating the infecting organism, we believe it is necessary to
embrace and further refine molecular diagnostic techniques to
improve their accuracy and better define their role. This case
highlights the role that NGS may play a role in isolation of the
infecting organism in a patient with PJI. This case report also
highlights that a pathogen causing PJI may originate from a pet.
