IMPORTANCE Day surgery puts demands on the patients to manage their own recovery at
home according to given instructions. Low health literacy levels are shown to be associated
with poorer health outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To describe functional health literacy levels among patients in Sweden
undergoing day surgery and to describe the association between functional health literacy
(FHL) and health care contacts, quality of recovery (SwQoR), and health-related quality of
life.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This observational study was part of a secondary
analysis of a randomized clinical trial of patients undergoing day surgery and was performed
in multiple centers from October 2015 to July 2016 and included 704 patients.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was SwQoR in the FHL groups 14
days after surgery. Secondary end points were health care contacts, EuroQol-visual analog
scales, and the Short Form (36) Health Survey in the FHL groups.
RESULTS Of 704 patients (418 [59.4%] women; mean [SD] age with inadequate or
problematic FHL levels, 47 [16] years and 49 [15.1], respectively), 427 (60.7%) reported
sufficient FHL, 223 (31.7%) problematic FHL, and 54 (7.7%) inadequate FHL. The global score
of SwQoR indicated poor recovery in both inadequate (37.4) and problematic (22.9) FHL.
There was a statistically significant difference in the global score of SwQoR (SD) between
inadequate (37.4 [34.7]) and sufficient FHL (17.7 [21.0]) (P < .001). The patients with
inadequate or problematic FHL had a lower health-related quality of life than the patients
with sufficient FHL in terms of EuroQol-visual analog scale scores (mean [SD], 73 [19.1],
73 [19.1], and 78 [17.4], respectively; P = .008), physical function (mean [SD], 72 [22.7],
75 [23.8], and 81 [21.9], respectively; P < .001), bodily pain (mean [SD], 51 [28.7], 53 [27.4],
and 61 [27.0], respectively; P = .001), vitality (mean [SD], 50 [26.7], 56 [23.5], and 62 [25.4],
respectively; P < .001), social functioning (mean [SD], 73 [28.2], 81 [21.8], and 84 [23.3],
respectively; P = .004), mental health (mean [SD], 65 [25.4], 73 [21.2], and 77 [21.2],
respectively; P < .001), and physical component summary (mean [SD], 41 [11.2], 42 [11.3], and
45 [10.1], respectively; P = .004). There were no differences between the FHL groups
regarding health care contacts.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Inadequate FHL in patients undergoing day surgery was
associated with poorer postoperative recovery and a lower health-related quality of life.
Health literacy is a relevant factor to consider for optimizing the postoperative recovery in
patients undergoing day surgery.

nthelastdecades,moreandmoresurgicalprocedureshave
been performed as day surgery.1,2 Patients are spending
less time in the hospital, and this places greater
demands on the patients and their relatives. Most of the
recovery process after surgery occurs at home without
direct supervision from health care professionals.3 Patients
undergoing day surgery are therefore provided with oral
information and written instructions on how to aid recovery
at home.3 Patients in today’
s health care system are
expected to take part and to be engaged in their own care.
Consequently, they have to be able to read and understand
health instructions on how to manage their own recovery at
home.4 Functional health literacy (FHL) is defined as an
individual’
s capacity to gain access to, and to understand
and use, information in ways to promote and maintain good
health.5 Several studies have raised awareness of health lit-
eracy and its consequences for the individual as well as for
aspects of health economy.6-9
In earlier research, low levels of FHL were shown to be as-
sociatedwithpoorergeneralhealth,10lowerhealth-relatedqual-

ies on patients undergoing day surgery that investigate these
questions. The aim of this study was to describe functional

surgery and to describe the association between functional
health literacy and postoperative recovery, HRQoL, and un-
planned health care visits.
Methods
Study Design and Setting
This observational study was part of a multicenter, 2-group,
parallel, single-blind randomized clinical trial conducted
from October 2015 to July 2016 at 4 day surgery depart-
ments in Sweden.18 The primary outcome for the random-
ized clinical trial was the cost-effectiveness of using Recov-
ery Assessment by Phone Points (RAPP) for follow-up after
day surgery compared with no follow-up with RAPP after
day surgery. Recovery Assessment by Phone Points is an
electronically assessed follow-up that measures quality of
recovery with the Swedish web version of Quality of Recov-
ery (SwQoR) and also enables patients to request a contact
telephone call with a nurse from the day surgery depart-
ment where the surgery was carried out.19 The study was
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of the
Helsinki Declaration (6th revision) and was approved by the
Uppsala/Örebro Region ethics committee (2015/262). Oral
and written consent was obtained from all participants.
Sample Selection
Inclusion criteria were undergoing day surgery, being 18 years
or older, having access to a smartphone, and being able to un-
derstand the Swedish language in writing and speech. Exclu-
sion criteria were alcohol and/or drug use, visual impair-
ment,cognitiveimpairment,orundergoingasurgicalabortion.
In the main randomized clinical trial, a computer-generated
randomization, including random permuted blocks to en-
sure similar numbers of participants in each group, was used.
The randomization was also stratified by center.18
Questionnaires
TheSwedishFHLscaleisintendedforself-assessmentandcon-
sists of 5 items on functional skills. The assessments are made
on a 5-grade ordinal scale according to how often items agree
with the person’
s own experiences; that is, never, seldom,
sometimes,often,oralways(eFigure1inthe Supplement).The
first item focuses on visual ability related to the design of the
text and its accessibility, the following 2 deal with understand-
ing words and concepts, the fourth focuses on the ability to
persevere in reading, and the last asks about needing help in
reading and understanding information. The FHL level of each
participant was calculated and the FHL levels were catego-
rized into 3 FHL groups: inadequate (reporting “often” or “al-
ways” to 1 or more of the 5 items), problematic (“sometimes”
to at least 1 item and not “often” or “always” to any items), or
sufficient (responding “never” or “seldom” to all items).20 The
SwedishFHLscalehasbeenpsychometricallytestedinaSwed-
ish population and found to be reliable and valid in terms of
content validity.20
The SwQoR measures quality of recovery and is a multi-
item questionnaire including 24 items (symptoms/signs) on an
11-point numerical rating scale from 0 (“none of the time”) to
10 (“all of the time”) (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). The global
score for SwQoR ranges between 0 (excellent postoperative re-
covery) and 240 (poor postoperative recovery). The assump-
tion was made in an earlier study that postoperative recovery
improves over time, and therefore, analysis was guided by the
mean of the total SwQoR score with an indication of good post-
operative recovery of less than 31 at day 7 and less than 21 at
day 14 indicating a good recovery.21 The SwQoR has been psy-
chometrically tested and found to be valid, and has excellent
reliability and a high degree of responsiveness.22
Key Points
Question Are there associations between health literacy and
postoperative recovery, health care contacts, and quality of life in
patients undergoing day surgery?
Findings In this study of 704 patients who were undergoing day
surgery as part of a randomized clinical trial, lower health literacy
levels were associated with a low quality of postoperative recovery
and quality of life. However, low health literacy levels were not
associated with increased health care contacts.
Meaning Identifying patients with low health literacy and
addressing their specific needs are important factors to consider
for optimizing the postoperative recovery in day surgery patients.

 To measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL), the
EuroQol-visual analog scale (EQ-VAS; EuroQol Research
Foundation)23,24 and Short Form (SF)-36 Health Survey25
were used. The EQ-VAS consists of a 20-cm vertically gradu-
ated visual analog scale with end points (anchors) of 0 (indi-
cating the worst imaginable health state) and 100 (indicat-
ing the best imaginable health state).
The SF-36 Health Survey consists of 36 items grouped
into 8 multi-item scales that measure physical function, role
function, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social func-
tioning, emotional role, and mental health. All scales are
scored from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating better
health status. Two summary scores are calculated, the
physical component summary and the mental component
summary; these summaries reflect overall physical and
mental health status.25-27 The validity and reliability of the
SF-36 has been shown to be acceptable in a general Swedish
population.25-27
To measure health care contacts, a study-specific ques-
tionnaire was used. The questionnaire included 5 yes/no
questions regarding the number of surgery-related health
care contacts with primary care, emergency department
(ED), or Sweden’
s 24-hour helpline 1177; outpatient hospital
visit, or contact via RAPP (this option was only possible for
the intervention group). Patients’age, sex, type of surgery
and anesthesia, and American Society of Anaesthesiologists
(ASA) class were also collected.
Data Collection
A research nurse was responsible for participants’inclusion
at their day surgery department and made sure that all par-
ticipants who were eligible for inclusion in the study were
offered enrolment. Written information about the study was
sent out together with information about the planned sur-
gery. Oral information was provided preoperatively on the
day of surgery. Preoperatively, on the day of surgery, the
participants answered paper-based questionnaires, SF-36
and EQ-VAS; at 2-weeks postoperatively they answered
Swedish FHL and SwQoR as well as the questionnaire
regarding contacts with health care during that 2-week
period following surgery.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics,
version 24 (IBM) and Microsoft Office Excel, version 2013
(Microsoft). Descriptive analyses were conducted for
sociodemographic factors, type of anesthesia and surgery,
ASA classification, and SwQoR and HRQoL characteristics.
Guided from earlier studies, means and standard deviations
were used for SwQoR.21,28-30 The differences between the
patients in the 3 FHL groups were analyzed. For nominal
data, χ2 was used; for ordinal data the Mann-Whitney U test
was used for comparisons between 2 groups, and the
Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparisons between 3
groups, and for normally distributed continuous data, 1-way
analysis of variance was used. A P value of <.01 was consid-
ered statistically significant.
Results
In the main study,18 1027 patients were included; of these, 704
patients(68.5%)completedtheSwedishFHLquestionnaireand
constitute the sample of this study. Of these patients, 418
(59.4%)werewomenand286(40.6%)weremen.Most(n = 427
[60.6%]) of the 704 patients undergoing day surgery re-
ported sufficient FHL, 223 (31.7%) reported problematic FHL,
and 54 (7.7%) reported inadequate FHL. There were no statis-
tical differences between the 3 groups in age, sex, type of an-
esthesia and surgery, or ASA classification (Table 1).
Functional Health Literacy and Postoperative Recovery
The global score of SwQoR indicated poor recovery in both
inadequate (37.2) and problematic (22.9) FHL. There was a
statistically significant difference in global score (SD) of
SwQoR between inadequate (37.4 [34.7]) and sufficient (17.7
[21.0]) FHL (P < .001). Most differences, 13 of 24 items
(54.2%), were found between inadequate and sufficient
FHL: trouble breathing (mean [SD], 0.8 [2.1] vs 0.1 [0.8];
P = .002), sleeping difficulties (mean [SD], 2.4 [2.9] vs 0.9
[1.9]; P < .001), not having a general feeling of well-being
(mean [SD], 2.7 [3.2] vs 1.0 [1.8]; P < .001), not feeling in
control of my situation (mean [SD], 2.1 [2.9] vs 0.7 [1.7];
P < .001), having difficulty feeling relaxed (mean [SD], 2.7
[2.9] vs 0.9 [1.7]; P < .001), voice not sounding the same as
usual (mean [SD], 1.0 [2.2] vs 0.3 [1.4]; P < .001), having dif-
ficulty taking care of my personal hygiene (mean [SD], 2.6
[3.0] vs 1.0 [2.0]; P < .001), dizziness (mean [SD], 0.8 [1.7] vs
0.3 [1.2]; P = .001), depressed (mean [SD], 2.0 [2.7] vs 0.7
[1.6]; P < .001), anxiety (mean [SD], 1.5 [2.1] vs 0.8 [1.7];
P = .001), sore mouth (mean [SD], 0.5 [1.5] vs 0.2 [0.9];
P = .001), difficulties concentrating (mean [SD], 1.5 [2.3] vs
0.5 [1.3]; P < .001), and fever (mean [SD], 0.6 [1.4] vs 0.2
[0.9]; P < .001) (Table 2).

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study that has examined
whether there is any association between postoperative re-
covery and functional health literacy in patients undergoing
day surgery. We found that patients with inadequate FHL ex-
perienced a poor recovery; that is, they reported higher scores
inSwQoRonpostoperativeday14comparedwithpatientswith
sufficient FHL. Patients with problematic FHL also experi-
enced a poor recovery; however, their scores (22.9) were just
above the limit for poor recovery (>21).21 It has been reported
that the quality of recovery is heavily influenced by the pa-
tient’
s personality traits,31 preparedness, coping strategies,
knowledgeregardingthenormalrecoverytrajectory,andsense
of security.32-34 Our results suggest that functional health lit-
eracy can now also be included as an influencing factor for the
quality of postoperative recovery. Low health literacy levels
have, among other factors, been shown to be associated with
poorer health-related knowledge and comprehension, includ-
ing the ability to read and understand perioperative
instructions,16 medication labels, and health messages6—skills
that are also necessary for patients undergoing day surgery. We
agree with the statement of Wright et al,12 which is also rel-
evant for patients undergoing day surgery, that surgical pa-
tients with low health literacy levels need extra time and re-
sources before discharge for information and instruction
regarding wound care and dietary changes, arranging home
care needs, and managing anxiety regarding self-care.
In our study we also found that an inadequate or prob-
lematic level of FHL was associated with lower self-rated QoL
when measuring HRQoL with EQ-VAS and SF-36. This finding
is in line with previous studies.11,35 Low FHL has also been re-
ported to have an association with older age9,10,15 and sex.10,14
However, in our study we found no association between low
FHL and sex or age. Yet, the mean age in our study was low at
47 to 49 years. Neither were there any associations found be-
tween low FHL and the type of anesthesia or surgery, or ASA
classification.
Concerning the number of health care contacts, low FHL
does not seem to have an effect, irrespective of the type of
health care contact. Our results are confirmed by Jessup et al15
who did not find any association between low health literacy
levels and a greater use of hospital services, as well as Wright
et al,12 who did not find any association with rates of emer-
gency department visits or hospital readmissions. However,
our results, as well as those of Jessup et al15 and Wright et al,12
contrast with earlier studies that report that lower health lit-
eracy levels were associated with a greater use of emergency
care and hospitalization.6,7,10,13 Yet, the difference could de-
pend on the age of the included study population or the fact
that our study, and that of Jessup et al,15 were performed more
recently.

ticipantsshouldhaveaccesstoasmartphone,becausethisstudy

 out access to smartphones, the proportion of persons with low
FHL might perhaps have been even greater. Still, smartphones
are owned by most Swedish people.37

and this process has hopefully successfully developed SwQoR
to be easily understood by all patients.
To our knowledge, there are no large studies on health lit-
eracy in a Swedish population for comparison. Compared with
a study on patients undergoing elective surgical procedures in
the Netherlands,8 our study had a lower proportion of partici-
pants with low health literacy levels. However, compared with
thestudyofWrightetal12onpatientsundergoingmajorabdomi-
nal surgery in the United States, we had the same proportion of
patients with inadequate or problematic health literacy. There
are earlier studies showing that the frequency of limited health
literacy differs depending on which instrument is used to mea-

needed to confirm these findings.
