ABSTRACT
Most sperm donation that occurs in the USA proceeds through anonymous
donation. While some clinics make the identity of the sperm donor avail-
able to a donor-conceived child at age 18 as part of ‘open identification’or
‘identity release programs,’no US law requires clinics to do so, and the ma-
jority of individuals do not use these programs. By contrast, in many parts
of the world, there have been significant legislative initiatives requiring that
spermdonoridentitiesbemadeavailabletochildrenafteracertainage(typ-
ically when the child turns 18). One major concern with prohibiting anony-
mous sperm donation has been that the number of willing sperm donors
will decrease leading to shortages, as have been experienced in some of the
countries that have prohibited sperm donor anonymity. One possible solu-
tion, suggested by prior work, would be to pay current anonymous sperm
donors more per donation to continue to donate when their anonymity is
removed. Using a unique sample of current anonymous and open identity

I. INTRODUCTION
Across the world, countries have reached radically different positions on whether to
allow anonymous sperm donation.
In the USA, most sperm donation that occurs proceeds through anonymous dona-
tion.1 While some clinics make the identity of the sperm donor available to a donor-
conceived child at age 18 as part of ‘open identification’or ‘identity release programs’
,2
no US law requires clinics to do so, and the majority of individuals do not use these
programs.
By contrast, in many parts of the world, there have been significant legislative ini-
tiatives requiring that sperm donor identities be made available to children after a
certain age (typically when the child turns 18). In 1985, Sweden became the first coun-
try to prohibit anonymous sperm donation by requiring that donor-conceived chil-
dren be able to receive identifying information about their sperm donor when ‘suffi-
cientlymature’
.3 TheSwedisheffortwasfollowedbyanumberofjurisdictionsincluding
Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the Australian States of Victoria and Western Australia,
the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand.4
There is a push by many for the USA to adopt a similar system to enable donor-
conceived children to have access to information on their donors.
As we discuss in much greater depth below, one major concern with prohibiting
anonymous sperm donation has been that the number of willing sperm donors will de-
creaseleadingtoshortages,ashavebeenexperienced insomeof thecountriesthathave
prohibited sperm donor anonymity.
One possible solution, suggested by prior work, would be to pay current anony-
mous sperm donors more per donation to continue to donate when their anonymity is
removed.5
Using a unique sample of current anonymous and open identity sperm donors from
a large sperm bank in the USA, we test that approach. As far as we know, this is the first

Section VI briefly concludes.
II. BACKGROUND
A. The alternative to anonymity: the UK model as an example
Before discussing the policy debate and prior empirical work on the subject, it is helpful
to better understand the alternative. Most countries that have prohibited sperm donor
anonymity have done so by legally requiring all sperm donors to put identifying infor-
mation into a ‘registry’available to the donor-conceived children at age 18.
The United Kingdom gives a good example about how these systems currently
operate.
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA)’
s website announces
to prospective egg or sperm donors:
Those who donated sperm, eggs or embryos after 1 April 2005 are, by law, identifiable.
Any person born as a result of donation after this time is entitled to request and receive
their donor’
s name and last known address, once they reach the age of 18.
Donors who donated before 1 April 2005 are automatically anonymous. This means that
donor-conceived people can only access non-identifying information provided by the
donor at the time of donation.
As a donor, you have no legal rights to contact your donor-conceived offspring; the deci-
sion to initiate contact is solely that of the donor-conceived child.
...
Itisarightofthosewhodonatedbefore1April2005tochoosetoremovetheiranonymity
– and potentially become identifiable to any children born from their donation.
As a consequence of removing your anonymity, your donor-conceived offspring may
choose to make contact with you once they reach the age of 18. The HFEA will try to
contact you first using the details held on file to let you know that a request for your con-
tact details has been made. Before making this decision, you may wish to consider how
this could impact on you and your family. If you wish, you can ask to speak to a coun-
sellor at the clinic you donated at to talk through the implications of re-registering as an
identifiable donor.

Bear in mind that you may not be contacted by any donor-conceived offspring. This could
beforanumberofreasons,includingthepossibilitythattheydonotknowtheyaredonor-
conceived.
If you donate through an HFEA-licensed clinic, you will not be legally responsible for any
child born as result of your donation.6
In terms of the information requested and available, the HFEA distinguishes between
identifyingand non-identifyinginformationitmakesavailabletodonor offspringatdif-
ferent ages:
From 1 April 2005 this is the information the HFEA collected from you at the time of
donation:
your physical description (height, weight, eye and hair colour)
the year and country of your birth
your ethnicity
whether you had any children at the time of donation, how many and their gender
your marital status
your medical history
a goodwill message to any potential children
identifying information (your name, date of birth and last known address).
Donor-conceived people conceived after 1 April 2005, when they reach 16 years old,
are able to apply to the HFEA to receive the non-identifying information that their
donor provided (all information given by the donor except for their name and last-known
address).
Donor-conceived people conceived after 1 April 2005, when they reach 18 years old are
able to apply to the HFEA to find the information their donor provided, including iden-
tifying information.7
B. The policy debate
Movements to legally prohibit sperm donor anonymity have succeeded in many Euro-
pean countries and Australia, whereas sperm donor anonymity remains legal (and in-
deed the norm) in the USA. In Canada, litigation to prohibit sperm donor anonymity
initially succeeded, only to be reversed at a higher court level.8
Underlying these legislative and judicial decisions is a vociferous bioethical debate
on the merits of prohibiting anonymous sperm donation. This debate has had several
dimensions.

sharing the donor’
s identity, especially in our current era of low-cost whole genome
sequencing.10
Some argue that removing anonymity actually furthers the interest of intended par-
ents who are employing sperm donors, because they may later change their minds and
wanttheirdonor-conceivedchildtoconnectwiththechild’
sgeneticfather.11 Theother
side disputes that such changes of preference are likely and stresses that a system that
does not prohibit anonymity better enables parents to satisfy a preference for contact
through the availability of open identity banks, and that such a solution is better than a
one-size-fits all approach.12
The most prominent argument for prohibiting anonymity has been that donor-
conceived children are harmed when they do not have access to the identities of
their genetic fathers, sometimes framed in the language of rights as a ‘right to know
one’
s genetic origin’
.13 Critics have responded that, among other things, this argument
rests on a philosophically unsound conception of harm—because changing the system
will change which or how many children come into existence instead of harming an
existing person.14 They have also argued that the same right, if it exists, should apply
to children born through coitus rather than reproductive technologies. This suggests
that the state would be justified in establishing a ‘one night stand registry’
, or mandat-
ing genetic testing for paternity to avoid the widespread phenomenon of misattributed
paternity through coital sex, which seems a reductio ad absurdum of the argument.15
Finally, and most pertinent to our purposes, there has been significant debate as to
whether banning sperm donor anonymity leads to significant reductions in the number
of men willing to be sperm donors and whether this effect is only short term or long
lasting.16
C. The problem (?) of sperm donor shortage
There is a rich, though contested, literature on the effects of prohibiting sperm donor
anonymity on the availability of sperm donors.
In general, countries that have prohibited sperm donor anonymity have seen
(at least) a short-term diminution in the pool of willing sperm donors. In 2010,

Gaia Bernstein devoted a significant portion of a law review article to determining the
effects on supply in various markets.17 A summary of her findings18 is as follows:
Sweden adopted sperm donor identification in 1985 and witnessed the number of chil-
dren born through sperm donation as the number of donor sperm decline from 200
new donors per year just before the law came into effect to 30 new donors per year by
1988. Reports also indicated that half the hospitals that offered artificial insemination
by donor closed their programs, both of which commentators attributed to the change
inthelaw.19 However,a1995studybasedondataaccumulatedbetween1989and1993
indicated a 65 per cent increase in the number of donors, from 69 new donors in 1989
to 106 in 1993, which some commentators took as evidence that the prohibition on
sperm donor anonymity only caused an initial decline in the number of donors that
was later overcome by recruitment measures.20 Bernstein, however, disputes that read-
ing of the data, noting that no study has looked at the post-1995 data, which are largely
unavailable.21 She suggests there is good reason to suspect that dwindling donor partic-
ipationremainsaprobleminSweden,pointingtoastudyshowingasteadydeclinefrom
900 yearly inseminations in 1985 to 300 yearly inseminations in 2005 as well as short-
agescausinglongwaitlistsof6to18monthsforaccesstoinsemination.Shefurthersug-
gests that earlier reports of a ‘rebound’may have been distorted and instead reflected
the fact that ‘demand may have been lower in Sweden than in other countries like the
USA because, until 2005, lesbians were not allowed to use donor sperm’
.22 Sweden’
s
rules about compensation have apparently changed over time: Sweden permits com-
pensation to sperm and egg donors, but since 2006 it has ‘begun prohibiting trading in
eggs and sperm for profit’
, even though ‘gamete owners who donate their gametes are
still compensated’
.23
The Australian state of Victoria enacted laws pertaining to sperm donor identifica-
tion in two stages. First, in 1984, Victoria created a mandatory donor registry that went
intoeffectin1988,butunderthislawnoinformationcouldbereleasedwithoutthecon-
temporaneousconsentof thedonor.Then,in1995thelegislaturepassed anewlawthat
went into effect in 1998 that allowed donor-conceived children to access information
about donors once they reach the age of 18.24 Reviewing the data, Bernstein concludes
that they show a ‘consistent decline in the numbers of newly registered sperm donors’
that is coincident in time with the passage of each of the laws.25 The scarcity of sperm

Data from the United Kingdom on the effects of sperm donor anonymity are more
difficult to interpret. By regulations that went into effect in 2006, all UK sperm donors
were required to put identifying information in a registry available to donor-conceived
children when they turn 18.27 Although the number of newly registered sperm donors
hasnotdeclinedfrombeforethelawchanged,somecontendthatthisstatisticisnotpar-
ticularlyprobativebecausetherehasbeenanincreaseinknowndonors—friendsorrel-
atives who donate for one person’
s exclusive use—such that the amount of sperm from
unrelated donors available to most infertile patients for use has significantly declined.28
Bernstein also finds evidence supporting a decline in the availability of sperm for repro-
ductive use from the fact that ‘IVF treatment cycles with donated sperm steadily de-
creased from 939 in 2004 to 711 in 2007 and insemination treatment cycles with donor
sperm decreased from 6892 in 2004 to 3878 in 2007’
.29 However, data from 2009 to
2010 released after her study suggest that these numbers ‘rebounded’to where they
were before the law change, although not for insemination.30 As Bernstein documents,
reports from the actual British clinics in the years immediately after the passage of the
Act also suggested significant shortages and longer wait times for those seeking to use
donated sperm.31

There are also more anecdotal data. For example, Kim Mutcherson reports that when Canada ‘made it il-
legal to pay men for their sperm or women for ova in a 2004 law called the Assisted Human Reproduc-
tion Act . . . the number of men in the country willing to sell their sperm dropped precipitously’

Bernstein’
s read of the data is not shared by all academics working in this area.
Naomi Cahn, for example, has written that while
requiring the release of information may have some initial impact on the number of
donors,predictionsofdrasticlong-termeffectsappearoverblown.Moreover,suchlegisla-
tion may result in the development of new methods to recruit other donors ... By chang-
ing advertising techniques to emphasize helping others rather than the amount of pay-
ment, sperm and egg banks may be able to recruit donors who care less about money and
more about facilitating the creation of families.... But payment, rather than anonymity,
does seem to remain a critical component; when Canada outlawed payment for sperm
donors, the sperm supply decreased dramatically.32
Observational studies such as these are useful, but they can only incompletely inform
our understanding of the policy choice that governments face. First, like most obser-
vational designs, these studies have difficulty separating coincidence from causation,
especially since none of these studies has a comparison state that can be used to evalu-
ate the results. In particular, one might worry about preexisting secular time trends in
donor participation in the countries that adopted donor identification laws and also
the possibility of reverse causation in that adoption of these laws may be driven by
these trends in donation and not vice versa. There may also be omitted variables that
affect both the rate of donation and the propensity to pass legislation, such as anti-
commercialization forces. Second, as Bernstein has noted, during the relevant periods
of these observational studies, changes in infertility technology and practices—for ex-
ample, the introduction of more effective procedures such as IVF and intracytoplasmic
sperm injection—make it more difficult to determine whether the data show changes
in the supply side alone or also changes in the demand side, which could have reduced
the need for sperm donors.33
Further, because most of these countries also have in place strict prohibitions on
sperm donor compensation (Sweden being a partial exception), these observational
studies are not optimally designed to investigate whether one can ‘buy’sperm donor
non-anonymity through increasing payment to donors.34
http://www.ctvnews.ca/anonymous-sperm-donation-needed-fertility-experts-1.567670 (accessed Oct. 12,
2016). It is also worth noting two reasons why this data may not offer a complete picture. The first is the pos-
sibility that there may exist some ‘underground’exchange of sperm or egg that tries to circumvent the non-
anonymity rules, for example, through at-home insemination. Second, to anticipate a point we return to at the
end of this chapter, medical tourism for reproductive technologies (‘fertility tourism’as other experts have
called it elsewhere, see I. GLENN COHEN, PATIENTS WITH PASSPORTS: MEDICAL TOURISM, LAW, AND ETHICS (Ch
9 (2014)) may provide parents a way of circumventing these rules through travel. We do not have that much
data on the role that anonymity plays in fertility tourism, but here is one pertinent study: In a 2010 study by
the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology of female patients seeking reproductive tech-
nology services through medical tourism at 46 clinics in six popular European destination countries for fertility
tourism, Shenfield and colleagues reported that 18.9 per cent of Swedish and 16.4 per cent of Norwegian pa-

D. Prior experimental work
Toourknowledge,CohenandCoan(2013)wasthefirststudytoevaluatetheinfluence
of mandatory identification laws on individual preferences for sperm donation using an
experimental design. The study relied on a convenience sample of 393 males between
theagesof18and60wholivedintheUSAatthetime.Subjectswererandomlyassigned
into one of two groups: a control group in which respondents received information on
donor confidentiality consistent with current US law (ie identifying information is pro-
tected by anonymity) or a treatment group that received information on confidential-
ity consistent with current UK law (ie identifying information is not protected in that
there is a mandatory registration requirement). The authors find that subjects in the
donor-identified condition needed to be paid significantly more, on average, to donate
theirspermthanthoseintheanonymousspermdonorconditions.Whenexaminingthe
full sample of subjects (N = 393), subjects receiving information on mandatory iden-
tification needed to be paid roughly $40 more than subjects in the control condition,
while subjects who would actually consider donating sperm (n = 332) require an addi-
tional$31onaverage.Inbothcases,thelossofanonymityisassociatedwithaconsider-
able extra estimated cost, although in absolute terms the cost of sperm is still relatively
‘cheap’(compared, for example, to eggs donation which typically demand $5000 to
$10 000 dollars35) even with these increased costs.
This price differential found in these studies corresponds roughly to that of the one
set of published data we have on differential pricing in the USA (based on what donors
are paid) for a US sperm bank that operates both anonymous and identity release pro-
grams. Gametes, Inc., a major US sperm bank, operates both anonymous and identity
releaseprograms:in2006,thebankpaid$65toanonymousspermdonorsperdonation
and $100 to those who donated as part of the identity release program.36
While the Cohen and Coan findings were suggestive, one major limitation has to do
with ecological validity. The men recruited for the study were not sperm donors. Would
sperm donors react the same way? As Cohen and Coan put it:
Sperm banks are notoriously selective in who they permit to donate, including screening
many individuals based on family medical history and how well their sperm freezes. In-
deed, upwards of 90 per cent of individuals who make initial contact with a sperm bank in
the U.S. are not chosen to become sperm donors. We have no idea how many members of
our sample would meet these sperm banks’criteria, and thus how representative our sam-
ple is as to actual U.S. sperm donors rather than potential sperm donors. That said, this
particularlimitationdoesnotseemoverlytroublingfortworeasons.First,wehavenorea-
son to suspect interactions between the kinds of things that would screen an individual
out from being a sperm donor and their responsiveness to the treatment vs. control con-
dition. Second, most of the criteria sperm banks currently use for screening are not fixed,
and sperm banks might change their criteria if they faced changes in the number of willing
donors. This has been a strategy used by many foreign countries in the wake of changing
their policy on anonymity.37

In order to overcome this limitation of our prior work, this paper represents the first
attempt to examine the same questions using actual anonymous sperm donors.
III. METHODS
A. Participants and procedures
We conducted an experiment to assess the effect of a change in donor identification
rulesonthewillingnessofsubjectstodonateandthepricerequiredtoensurecontinued
donation. The study was administered from June 15, 2013 to August 15, 2013 using a
sample of active and inactive donors from a large cryobank in the USA. The bank had
multiple locations and employs recruitment efforts similar to other large US banks. A
staff member at the bank sent an invitation to participate in ‘a unique opportunity’to
participate in a research study and offered a 15$ Amazon gift card ‘as a thank you for
... participat[ing]’
. In addition to the initial request for participation, the bank sent two
reminder emails (roughly 5 days apart) and a final email indicating that it was their
‘last chance to participate’the day prior to closing the study. In the end, we sent the
questionnaire to 67 active donors and 204 inactive donors; of these individuals, all 67
active responded to the questionnaire, while 94 inactive donors responded (response
rate=46percent).Ofthe161respondentsinoursample,90are(orwere)anonymous
donors and 71 are (or were) ID donors.
B. Experimental design and procedures
Our experimental design employed follows closely the prior work of Cohen and
Coan.38 After reading a one-page information sheet and consenting to be part of the
research study, participants were randomly assigned to either a treatment or control
condition.Subjectsinthetreatmentconditionwereaskedtocarefullyreadthefollowing
information on the UK system prior to answering the questionnaire:
Many developed nations require sperm donors to be identified, typically requiring new
sperm donors to put identifying information into a registry that is made available to a
donor-conceived child once they reach the age of 18. Recently, advocates have pressed
U.S. states to adopt these registries as well, and some state legislatures have considered
adopting such systems. In this study, we are interested in your reaction to one particular
proposed model of sperm donor identification system (we will call this “the sperm donor
identification system” in our questions) based on the U.K. system. In this system, by law,
any person born as a result of your donation, once he/she reaches the age of 18, is entitled
to request and receive (from a government-run agency) the following information:
r Identifying information (your name, date of birth and last known address)
r Your physical description (height, weight, eye and hair color) at the time of
donation
r The country of your birth
r Your ethnicity
r Whether you had any children at the time of donation, how many, and their gender
r Your marital status at the time of donation
r Your medical history at the time of donation
r A message (which you may choose to write) to any potential children.

r Sperm donor anonymity and compensation
The donor would have no legal rights to contact the offspring; the decision to initiate con-
tact is solely that of the donor-conceived child. Donors are protected from any kind of
parental responsibility by state and federal law.
The treatment was designed to communicate efficiently the most salient features of UK
donor laws and thus provide a realistic opportunity for donors to assess the costs as-
sociated with a change in the law. Following Cohen and Coan, we attempt to mitigate
possible order effects associated with the informational bullets by (i) fixing the position
of the first bullet on ‘identifying information’and (ii) randomizing the order of the re-
maining bullets. After reading the text on mandatory identification rules, subjects in the
treatment condition were asked to provide the amount of money needed to donate and
given the option to not donate ‘at any price’(see Section III.C for additional details).
Subjectsinthecontrolconditiondidnotreceiveanyinformationonmandatoryiden-
tification rules. After agreeing to participate in the study, these subjects were once again
asked to provide the amount of money needed to donate and given the option to not
donate ‘at any price’
. That is, the only difference between the treatment and control con-
ditions was the provision of information on UK identification rules.
C. Measuring the ‘
willingness-to-accept’for donation
There is a well-developed literature on the methodological challenges associated with
providing valid and reliable measures of a subject’
s ‘willingness-to-pay’(WTP) or
‘willingness-to-accept’(WTA) for the provision of a particular good or service.39
Developed primarily in the field of natural resource economics, ‘contingent valuation’
(CV)methodsofferasetoftoolsforaddressingpolicyquestionsassociatedwithpublic
goods and market failures, and thus have garnered considerable attention in the liter-
ature.40 As a result, there is now well-developed literature outlining the best practices
for employing CV methods to meet diverse policy goals.41
The obvious question when employing CV methods centers on how one should go
about eliciting a value for WTP or WTA. There is no shortage of different elicitation
formats in the literature, ranging from simple open-ended questions to more compli-
cated dichotomous choice designs.42 In the present study, we employed open-ended
questions to elicit a subject’
s WTA. Specifically, subjects in the treatment condition
received the following question:
‘If U.S. law was changed in this way, how much money, if any, would you need to be paid
in order to donate your sperm?’
We employ the open-ended CV format for both practical and methodological rea-
sons. First, dichotomous choice methods require considerable sample sizes to ensure

efficient estimation,43 which are infeasible to meet given the overall size of the available
donor pool in the USA, and certainly at any one sperm bank. In contrast, the open-
ended format offers a highly efficient use of information. Second, dichotomous choice
models are appropriate—and often necessary—when subjects have limited informa-
tion on the valuation decision. For instance, asking an individual to place a price on a
national park is likely be challenging, as few people have given this valuation decision
muchthoughtandthusmayfeelasiftheyare‘pickingavalueoutofthinair’
.Cohenand
Coan make a similar argument when using a convenience sample of males in the USA,
most of which have never donated sperm in the past. However, given that the present
study focuses on actual donors, ‘[the open-ended format] is likely to work quite well
for the population of current sperm donors...as these individuals have first-hand expe-
rience with the sperm donation process and have been compensated for donating in
the past’
.44
D. Representativeness of the inactive donor sample
While the active donors were highly responsive to our questionnaire, inactive donors
registered a response rate of 46 per cent. Although survey non-response does not nec-
essarily imply non-response bias,45 it is useful to identify any major imbalances in key
demographics across our data and the sampling frame. We have some auxiliary in-
formation from which we can screen for imbalances. More specifically, we were able
to obtain aggregate information on the age, race (percent white), religion (percent
Christian), and marital status at the time of donation (percent married) for individ-
uals contacted as part of our study. Figure 1 provides a visual representation of how
close our respondents are to the sampling frame for each of the available demographic
indicators. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the characteristics of our non-respondents con-
form closely to the distribution in the sampling frame. Our sample is a little higher
than expected in the 25 to 29 age category and a bit lower in the 30 to 35 category.
In general, the distributions are similar, which in turn improves our confidence that
major imbalances are unlikely and thus mitigates the potential for non-response bias
in this subsample (none of the observed differences are statistically different from
zero).
From a policy perspective, it is also worth noting that the active donors are proba-
bly the more important pool to measure. If the US regime changes from permitting to
prohibiting anonymous sperm donation, active rather than inactive donors will likely
be the first population from which sperm banks will try to recruit. However, given the
relatively small sample size for active, anonymous donors (n = 52), we focus on both
active and inactive donors in the analysis that follows. Although this may be viewed as a
limitationofourdesign,itisimportanttonotethatthiswasanextremelydifficult—and
expensive—sample to attain and it improves on existing experimental studies of policy
change and donor compensation.

E. Estimation procedure
To gauge donor reactions to the mandatory identification treatment, we focus on two
primaryoutcomesmeasures:(i)whetherthesubject‘refusestodonateatanyprice’and
(ii) the WTA for subjects remaining in the donor pool. These two measures allow one
toeffectivelycapturekeypointsinadonor’
sdecisioncalculus.Thatis,whenfacedwitha
mandatoryidentificationlaw,donorsmustfirstchoosewhethertoremaininthemarket
and then—conditional on their decision to continue donating—specify the financial
incentive necessary to participate.
We model the first stage in this decision process using logistic regression and the
second stage using the parametric WTA model outlined in Cohen and Coan (2013).46
46 Decisions regarding the overall WTA are nested within the group of individuals that actually choose to remain
in the donor pool. We begin our analysis by modeling the probability of refusal (ri) as a function of treatment
assignment (Ti) using a standard logistic regression model:
Pr(ri = 1) = logit−1(α0 + α1Ti )

481
While the details of logistic regression are well known to scholars of law and public
policy, the analysis of contingent valuation data is less common. To remain consistent
with past scholarship,47 we utilize the standard exponential WTA function:
WT Ai = e β0+βTi +ei ,
where Ti represents an indicator variable for treatment status and εi is the stochastic
error term (ln(εi) ∼ N(0, σ 2)). Cohen and Coan48 demonstrate that the commonly
employed exponential WTA function was appropriate when valuing sperm donation
both in pre-test data and in a convenience sample of potential donors. And given that
the current study employs an experimental design very similar to the approach used in
Cohen and Coan, we are confident regarding the usefulness of this specification in the
current context.
There are also a number of challenges specific to modeling WTA data. Although
relying on an open-ended question offers benefits in terms of efficiency, this elicita-
tion format is susceptible to so-called protest bids.49 Our sample is not immune to this
problem: five subjects report a WTA of more than $500 per donation, with a maximum
bid of $5000. Not adjusting for these extreme cases—especially given current sample
sizes—has the potential to heavily influence reported differences across groups and
yet there is no agreed upon method for treating these bids in the literature.50 We are
thus left with the question of how best to adjust for the potential influences of extreme
bids.
Determining the ‘correct’adjustment for protest bids turns on what one is will-
ing to assume about the motivation of such bids and thus it is often necessary to es-
timate a range of models and gauge the sensitivity of the estimated WTA under varying
The next step is to model each subject’
s WTA, conditional on their refusal or non-refusal. Assuming an exponential
WTA function, we are left with the following:
WT Ai =
� irrelevant
if
ri = 1
e β0+β1Ti +εi
if
ri = 0
We can thus estimate differences in the WTA across treatment and control conditions using a standard log-
normal regression.
Ideally, one would want to estimate the two steps simultaneously, propagating the error from the first to
second stage. There are well-known methods for achieving this objective in the context of longitudinal data, c.f.

assumptions.51 Atoneextreme,ananalystmayincludeoutlyingbidsduringestimation,
reasoning that donors have carefully considered the costs of donation under different
regulatory environments and have registered accurate WTA values accordingly. At the
other extreme, one may simply drop—or ‘trim’
—extreme observations, assuming that
for all practical purposes these bids are equivalent to ‘refus[ing] to donate at any price’
.
As a middle ground between these two extremes, one might also advocate treating ex-
treme observations as censored and estimate models to accurately censoring in WTA
data.
With little theoretical guidance as to which assumption is more appropriate in
the context of past and present sperm donors, we estimate the WTA of dona-
tion under a range of different scenarios. Specifically, in the next section, we not
only present estimates using the ‘full sample’(ie including protest bids), but also
estimates that censor extreme observations across a range of pre-specified values
($500 and $400).
IV. RESULTS52
A. Refusal to donate
We begin our analysis by examining whether and to what extent subjects receiving the
treatment condition refuse to donate ‘for any amount of money’
. Figure 2 provides the
posterior distribution of the first difference in the predicted probability of respondents
that ‘refuse to donate’across the treatment and control conditions. First, when consider-
ing the full sample of both active and inactive donors (see Fig. 2a), our data suggest that
movingtoamandatorydonoridentificationsystemcouldleadtoroughly29percentof
our participants refusing to donate (posterior median = 0.287, 95 per cent credible in-
terval = [0.126, 0.436]). Second, when restricting the subsample of active donors (see
Fig. 2b), we find that mandatory identification could lead approximately 28 per cent of
participants to refuse to donate (posterior mean = 0.282, 95 per cent credible interval
= [0.069, 0.485]). An estimated decline in the number of participants close to 30 per
cent would arguably have economic implications for the market for sperm donation—
both in terms of the potential costs of maintaining an adequate level of donor supply
and/or the quality of the samples provided.53 The estimated credible intervals are quite
wide. Yet, even assuming a lower-bound estimate of an approximate 7 per cent refusal
rate, the potential economic implications of a change in identification laws remains
considerable.
51 Id.
52 We use Bayesian methods to estimate the models described in Section III.E (though the results are con-
sistent when using classical methods). Across all specifications, we follow Gelman et al.’
s suggestion and
use weakly informative priors. For the logistic regression parameters (α0 and α1), we use Cauchy priors
(α ∼ Cauchy(0, 2.5)); for log-normal regression, we rely on normal priors after standardizing the (log) WTA
(β ∼ N(0, 1)); and for the standard deviation for the log-normal regression, we rely on a half-Cauchy prior
(σ ∼ half-Cauchy(0, 5)). See generally Andrew Gelman et al., A Weakly Informative Default Prior Distribu-
tion for Logistic and other Regression Models, 2 ANN. APPL. STAT. 1360 (2008). Note that all of the data and
code necessary to replicate this analysis are available at https://github.com/traviscoan/donor compensation
(accessed Oct. 12, 2016).
53 Though, as we discuss in greater depth below, there are normative controversies about how to define ‘quality’
,
and whether in some domains sperm banks are too selective.

B. Estimated changes in the WTA to donate
The previous section suggests that mandatory identification could lead to roughly
28 per cent of respondents refusing to donate ‘at any price’
. When considering those
individuals that would still consider donating, the obvious question remains: What
price is needed to ensure continued participation? Figure 3 provides the estimated ef-
fect of receiving the treatment under a range of different assumptions.54 Starting with
our estimates based on the ‘full sample’(ie both extreme and non-extreme bids), these
data suggest a difference in the median WTA across treatment and control of approx-
imately $102 (posterior median = $102.076, 95 per cent highest density interval =
[$46.497, $171.819]). In economic terms, this difference is considerable: individuals
54 Note that Figure 3 pools both active and inactive donors due to the relatively small sample size available after
adjusting for subjects that refuse to donate at any price (n = 71, including both active and inactive). While
this is less than ideal from a policy perspective (see the discussion in Section III.D), it is necessary to ensure
adequate precision for our estimates.

receiving the mandatory donor identification treatment demanded more than double
the current rate compensation.
Including protest bids in the WTA estimate may overstate the effect of manda-
tory identification laws on the necessary level of donor compensation. How sensitive
is this estimate to alternative assumptions on extreme bids? To explore this question,
we present estimates under a range of assumptions regarding extreme observations.

Turning first to the censored estimates (Fig. 3b and d), we find that the difference
between treatment and control is considerable, even when assuming a relatively con-
servative cut-off point for what constitutes a ‘protest bid’
. Specifically, when censoring
the WTA values at $400 per donation (about five times the current going rate), the
estimated median difference is approximately $84 (posterior median = $83.974, 95
per cent highest density interval = [$38.286, $139.745]). In contrast to the estimates
based on censored models, the ‘trimmed’specifications are more influenced by one’
s
decision regarding what constitutes a protest bid. In the conservative scenario with an
assumed cut-off point of $400, the estimated median difference is $40 (posterior me-
dian = $40.12, 95 per cent highest density interval = [$6.434, $82.082]). While about
half of the censored regression estimate under similar assumptions, this effect still rep-
resents economically meaningful change in the price of sperm.
V. DISCUSSION
Our study is the first to examine how current US sperm donors would react to legal
change requiring identification of those donors through a registry system of the kind in
place in the United Kingdom, the most plausible policy alternative. We find that such
a change would have significant effects. Our best estimate is that 28 per cent of current
sperm donors will refuse to donate if the law changed in this way, and the remaining
donors would demand anywhere from $40 to $102 more per donation in our preferred
specification, depending on how one defines a protest bid.55
Are these numbers large or small?
Our results generally suggest that changes in mandatory identification rules have a
considerable impact on an individual’
s preference regarding donation.
First, in terms of the willingness to donate at all under a regime that required iden-
tification, Cohen and Coan found that not a single individual from the general public
refusedtodonatewhenexposedtothemandatoryidentificationtreatmentcondition.56
By contrast, we find here that over a quarter of active, anonymous donors would refuse
to donate ‘at any price’if identification was legally required. All else equal, this reac-
tion would imply a considerable drop in the current number of available donors. It is
possible the effect is even larger because our design determines whether active donors
would donate or not with a change in the law, but does not determine whether those
active donors willing to donate might reduce the amount of donation should the law
change—though to be fair the opposite reaction is possible, if less plausible.
Second, in terms of the extra amount required to pay sperm donors per donation,
Cohen and Coan found that roughly $31 per sperm donation was required to induce
individualstobeidentifiedratherthananonymousdonors.57 Wefindherethatdepend-
ing on the estimate used, it would require anywhere from roughly a 29 per cent increase
to three times that amount for actual sperm donors.
55 It is important to note that choosing a cut-off point for protest bids could influence the estimated refusal pro-
portion. If one relies on the trimmed estimates—and thus assumes that protest bids and refusal to donate are
equivalent—then the refusal proportions in Figure 2 will rise (or fall) based on the assumed cut-off point. For
instance, if one assumes a (conservative) cut-off of $400, this estimated refusal probability from 0.28 to 0.39
for active donors (posterior median = 0.389, 95 per cent highest density interval = [0.169, 0.588]).

When considering the actual cost increase associated with mandatory identification
laws, it is market, not individual, reactions that are paramount. How will the market for
spermdonorsreacttosuchachangeinlaw?Answeringthisquestioninvolveshavingin-
formation on the shape of the demand and supply curves for donations, while also con-
sidering the potential implications for the ‘quality’of the donor pool. Unfortunately,
detailed information identifying supply and demand are not publicly available—yet,
we can still assess the plausibility of a range of scenarios under alternative assumptions.
We first outline a scenario in which changes in the law have little influence on price.
If we assume that demand is relatively inelastic (unresponsive to price) and the pool of
potential donors is much larger than current demand, then a change in the law should
have a nominal impact on the actual price. For instance, if the market offers an addi-
tional$85perdonation,thiscouldspurmoreyoungmentoenterthedonorpool,while
also enticing current donors to donate more frequently. Moreover, given that each do-
nation can be spread over multiple vials, the actual increase in production cost passed
on to consumers may be quite modest. As such, market forces work to mitigate the po-
tential impacts of 28 per cent drop in the current donor pool and anywhere from $40
to $102 increase required per donation.
There are, however, a number of features associated with the US market that chal-
lenge this optimism. While the US. market is currently experiencing an excess supply of
donors and inventory, these excesses vary considerably across racial and ethnic groups.
For sought after donor profiles, the market is often quite thin and thus a double-digit
decline in the current donor pool could prove significant. Moreover, the vast majority
of American males have not considered donating and of the ones that do, only roughly
1/200 applicants makes it through the rigorous screening process. These observations
raise important questions regarding the assumption of a ‘thick’labor market for dona-
tions and suggest important trade-offs regarding the ‘quality‘ of the donor pool given
current consumer preferences.
In the end, considerable uncertainty remains regarding the likely market reaction
to mandatory donor identification rules and what this means for price. Further, the ex-
pected effect of donor laws turns on what one is willing to assume regarding the size
of the potential pool of donors and how sensitive individuals not in the current donor
pool are to price. Yet, it is important to note that even a pessimistic view on a potential
increase in the price of sperm would nonetheless still imply a cost well below the cur-
rent price paid for donor eggs. Egg donors are paid roughly $5000 to $10 000 typically
per cycle in the USA, although the risks and burdens of egg donation are significantly
higher.58

two hypotheses for why these numbers differ from Cohen and Coan, each of which has
different implications for policy:
First, current sperm donors are more subject to endowment effects regarding the
current state of the law, and their responses may reflect a feeling of ‘loss’of something

they value (anonymity) that will not be available to future donors should the law
change. For this reason it is possible that our results represent a transitional effect,
such that new populations of sperm donors might be more willing to participate in an
identification-required regime and demand less payment closer to that in Cohen and
Coan.
Second, current sperm donors are ‘elite’in the sense that the vast majority of sperm
banks are notoriously selective in who they permit to donate, including screening many
individuals based on family medical history and how well their sperm freezes. Indeed,
upward of 90 per cent of individuals who make initial contact with a sperm bank in the
USA are not chosen to become sperm donors.59 In order to maintain the current num-
ber of sperm donors, banks thus might need to relax some of their standards, which
would bring the sperm donor population more in line with the estimates in Cohen and
Coan.60 Whether such a change in standards would be good or bad depends, in part,
on how much of the current standards reflect success rates and health requirements as
opposed to the preferences of the recipients of the sperm. That said, there are likely
elements of the existing standards whose importance is beyond cavil—lack of STI or
other serious genetic diseases and the ability for sperm to freeze well and thus produce
successful offspring when thawed. There may also be opportunities in targeting differ-
ent kinds of men for recruitment as sperm donors in a way that maintains more of the
current standards; for example, in Sweden and the Australian province of Victoria, ‘re-
cruitment efforts have focused increasingly on the older, more altruistically motivated
donor as a way of rebounding from the initial dampening effects’of the prohibition on
donor anonymity.61
A different way of contextualizing our results is by comparison to international ex-
perience. To lose roughly a third of one’
s donor is no doubt a significant problem for
most sperm banks. But certainly the effect would be smaller than that reported in the
observationalstudiesintheliteratureinSweden.Inthethreeyearsafteritslawchanged,
Sweden saw the number of new donors per year decline from 200 to 30 (though these
are new donors).62 As discussed above, there are ongoing arguments about whether
these numbers rebounded (suggesting the transitional problem discussed above) or
have remained low, and there have been similar debates over data from other countries
that have adopted prohibitions on sperm donor anonymity.

for this article raised the question of whether there were important differences between active and ‘retired’
donors in our sample. When we asked our sperm bank contact we were told: ‘Retired donors did not have an
experience significantly different than actively producing donors. The compensation has not changed much
if at all in the past decade. The amount of information collected from them has also not changed. The basic
screening protocols are similar across banks due to FDA regulations that determine donor eligibility that went

Our findings suggest that such a change would have a significant, but perhaps not in-
surmountable, effect on the supply of sperm in the USA should the law change.
We hope that this study creates a foundation for other research in this area. A few
particular projects would be interesting to pursue: first, our work here and the prior
work of Cohen and Coan have focused only on sperm donors. Across the world the
law changes have affected not only men but also women who serve as egg donors. It

law changes prohibiting donor anonymity. Second, this study examines sperm donors’
reactions to only one method of disclosure, based on the registry system in place in the
United Kingdom and a number of other countries where the child may call in at age 18
to determine if he or she is donor conceived and receive identifying information about
the donor. While this has been the main disclosure regime put into place across the
world, one can imagine other possible approaches including providing the information
directly to children at age 18 regardless of whether they call in to find out, giving donors
the right to contact the children, maintaining the UK-type registry but making the in-
formation on the donor available to children at a younger age, and so forth. It would be
interesting in further work to examine sperm donors’reactions to this richer panoply
of possible market designs. A final suggestion for further research came from one of the
paper’
s reviewers who suggested that we might also repeat our study with sperm donor
applicants, rather than those who had been accepted as sperm donors.
