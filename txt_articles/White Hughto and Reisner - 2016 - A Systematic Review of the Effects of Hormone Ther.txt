on Psychological Functioning and Quality of Life
in Transgender Individuals

Abstract
Objectives: To review evidence from prospective cohort studies of the relationship between hormone therapy
and changes in psychological functioning and quality of life in transgender individuals accessing hormone ther-
apy over time.
Data Sources: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and PubMed were searched for relevant studies from inception to Novem-
ber 2014. Reference lists of included studies were hand searched.
Results: Three uncontrolled prospective cohort studies, enrolling 247 transgender adults (180 male-to-female
[MTF], 67 female-to-male [FTM]) initiating hormone therapy for the treatment of gender identity disorder
(prior diagnostic term for gender dysphoria), were identified. The studies measured exposure to hormone ther-
apy and subsequent changes in mental health (e.g., depression, anxiety) and quality of life outcomes at follow-
up. Two studies showed a significant improvement in psychological functioning at 3–6 months and 12 months
compared with baseline after initiating hormone therapy. The third study showed improvements in quality of life
outcomes 12 months after initiating hormone therapy for FTM and MTF participants; however, only MTF partic-
ipants showed a statistically significant increase in general quality of life after initiating hormone therapy.
Conclusions: Hormone therapy interventions to improve the mental health and quality of life in transgender
people with gender dysphoria have not been evaluated in controlled trials. Low quality evidence suggests
that hormone therapy may lead to improvements in psychological functioning. Prospective controlled trials
are needed to investigate the effects of hormone therapy on the mental health of transgender people.

Introduction
Transgender people have a gender identity or expres-
sion that differs from their sex assigned at birth.
Research documents high prevalence of depression,
anxiety, and suicidal ideation among transgender indi-
viduals relative to the general population.1–3 Many
transgender people experience psychological distress
related to the discrepancy between their birth sex and
felt a sense of being male, female, or otherwise gender
nonconforming.4 Some individuals experience gender-
related psychological distress at such an extreme level
that their distress meets criteria for a formal psychiatric
diagnosis—Gender Dysphoria.4 The critical element of
gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically signifi-
cant distress associated with the strong and persistent
difference between one’s expressed/experienced gender
and one’s sex assigned at birth.5 The World Professio-

 Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and
Gender Nonconforming People (Version 7) lists social
transition (living full or part-time in one’s gender iden-
tity), psychotherapy, surgery, and hormone therapy as
treatment options for individuals with gender dyspho-
ria.6 While each person’s treatment plan is individual-
ized, and may include one or multiple interventions,
hormone therapy is generally the first medical inter-
vention accessed by individuals with gender dysphoria
who seek to masculinize or feminize their body to be
consistent with their gender identity.6
Feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapy is the
administration of exogenous endocrine agents to in-
duce changes in physical appearance.6 Since hormone
therapy is inexpensive relative to surgery and highly ef-
fective in the development of secondary sex characteris-
tics (e.g., facial and body hair in female-to-male [FTM]
individuals or breast tissue in male-to-females [MTFs]),
hormone therapy is often the first, and sometimes only,
medical gender affirmation intervention accessed by
transgender individuals looking to develop masculine
or feminine characteristics consistent with their gender
identity. In some cases, hormone therapy may be re-
quired before surgical interventions can be conducted.6
Changing one’s physical characteristics through hor-
mone therapy is considered medically necessary for
many transgender individuals and may relieve the psy-
chological distress associated with gender dysphoria,
reduce psychiatric comorbidities, and improve pa-
tients’ quality of life.6 The efficacy of hormone therapy
in relieving psychiatric distress related to gender dys-
phoria has largely been inferred through clinical prac-
tice and low quality evidence.7 In 2008, the first
systematic review exploring the relationship between
hormone therapy and the mental health of transgender
individuals was conducted.7 Published in 2010, the re-
view found that hormone therapy in individuals with
gender identity disorder (the DSM-IV diagnostic name
for gender dysphoria) likely improves gender dysphoria,
psychological function, comorbidities (e.g., depression,
anxiety, and suicidality), sexual functioning, and overall
quality of life.7 However, the quality of the empirical ev-
idence was very low. All of the reviewed studies pertain-
ing to psychological functioning were nonrandomized
and largely cross-sectional designs. Moreover, the ma-
jority of the studies evaluated hormone therapy in con-
cert with sex reassignment surgery and so an evaluation
of the specific relationship between hormone therapy
and the psychological functioning of transgender indi-
viduals independent of surgical interventions was not
possible. Since 2008, several higher quality studies ex-
ploring the relationship between hormone therapy and
psychological functioning in transgender individuals
have been published, thus an updated systematic evalu-
ation of the research literature is warranted.
The primary objectives of this review were to locate
and describe studies examining the relationship be-
tween hormone therapy and the psychological func-
tioning of transgender individuals; determine the risk
of experiencing psychiatric distress in transgender indi-
viduals receiving hormone therapy compared with
those not receiving hormone therapy or the general
population; examine whether transgender individuals
with poor mental health experience an improvement
in their mental health status after the initiation of a
hormone regimen; and assess whether any differences
in the strength and direction of the association between
hormone therapy and psychological functioning exist
by gender identity (i.e., for MTF vs. FTM subjects).
Additionally, the review aimed to assess the strength
of evidence showing a relationship between hormone
therapy and healthy psychological functioning in
transgender individuals and identify future research
and clinical practice needs.
Methods
PRISMA8 reporting guidelines were used in the devel-
opment of this protocol-driven report. The protocol
was not published, but is available upon request.
Eligibility criteria
Studies were eligible for this review if they enrolled
transgender or transsexual (or another term used to de-
scribe individuals with a gender identity different from
their assigned sex at birth) individuals who were seek-
ing hormone therapy to masculinize or feminize the
body. All participants had been diagnosed with having
gender identity disorder (prior diagnostic name for
gender dysphoria).
Because the goal was to assess changes in psycholog-
ical functioning and quality of life after initiating hor-
mone therapy, only studies with a longitudinal design
were included in the review. No randomized controlled
trials were identified. All included studies were non-
randomized (observational) and uncontrolled, prospec-
tive cohort studies. One-time cross-sectional studies,
single case reports, case series, review articles, commen-
taries, letters, and studies that did not contain original
data were excluded. Studies were included regardless
of sample size. Only English language publications

22
 were included in the search. Studies following partici-
pants for less than 3 months were excluded.
Interventions were limited to the administration
of feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapy. Due
to the wide variation of doses and types of hormones,
all forms of hormone administration (e.g., self or provider
injection, oral pill, intramuscular, transdermal patch or
gel, or subcutaneous implant), dosing levels, dose fre-
quency, and types (e.g., estrogen, androgen-reducing
medications, progestins, testosterone, bioidentical, and
compounded hormones) were included. Psychiatric dis-
orders (DSM diagnosis or clinically significant sympto-
mology), general psychological functioning, and general
quality of life outcomes were assessed.
Study identification
The first author consulted an expert reference librarian
to design and conduct the electronic search strategy with
input from the second author and collaborators with
expertise in conducting systematic reviews. To identify
eligible studies, electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE,
Ovid PsycInfo, and PubMed) were searched from incep-
tion to November 2014. Controlled vocabulary supple-
mented with keywords was used to define the concept
areas (transgender/transsexual, hormone therapy, psy-
chiatric disorder, psychological functioning, and quality
of life). A hand search of the bibliographies of retrieved
articles was also conducted. A detailed list of subject
headings and text words is available upon request.
The first author examined abstracts and titles from
the initial search to identify studies that appeared to
meet the inclusion criteria. Abstracts were screened
twice for inclusion. The full article was then obtained
for all studies appearing to meet inclusion criteria or
in instances where there was insufficient information
from the title, keywords, and abstract to make a clear
decision. The studies meeting the inclusion criteria
were checked for validity assessment (see the Quality
assessment section) and data extraction.
Data collection
Data were extracted for the studies that met inclusion
criteria, and then entered into RevMan5. Data were
extracted using specially developed data extraction
forms to ensure standardization, which included the
following headings:
Participant characteristics.
Age, birth sex, gender iden-
tity, income, education, and psychiatric comorbidities
(all at baseline).
Study characteristics.
Recruitment method, inclusion/
exclusion criteria, setting, allocation procedure, sam-
ple size analyzed, study design features, and follow-up
period.
Intervention.
Description of intervention, mode and
frequency of delivery, number, and explanation for
any dropouts.
Outcomes.
Description of measures used, continu-
ous/dichotomous nature, and validated or unvalidated
method of administration.
Statistical results.
Adjusted and unadjusted effect esti-
mates (if available) and measures of variability, fre-
quency counts for dichotomous variables, and number
of patients.
Confounding.
Specific confounders included the fol-
lowing factors, which could impact the mental health
of participants independently of hormone therapy: re-
ceiving psychotherapy in addition to hormone therapy;
accessing other medical gender affirmation technolo-
gies (i.e., silicon injections, surgeries, electrolysis) in ad-
dition to hormone therapy; possessing any underlying
treated or untreated comorbid psychiatric conditions; re-
lationship factors and social support (positive or negative
relationships with family, friends, sexual partners); dis-
crimination experiences (in employment, housing, etc.);
barriers and facilitators to healthcare access (insurance
coverage for hormones or surgeries; feasibility in access-
ing trained and competent providers, etc.); prior or
concurrent use of street-based hormones; and patient
characteristics (age, income, level of education).
Quality assessment (risk of bias)
In consultation with an expert in systematic reviews, the
first author assessed the risk of bias for each study and
reported the bias in the Risk of Bias table according
to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions.9 Specifically, sequence generation, allo-
cation sequence concealment, blinding, incomplete
outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other
potential sources of bias were assessed. Items were
assessed by first providing a description of what oc-
curred in the study and then providing a judgment
on the adequacy of the study as it relates to each
item. When assessing bias, studies were scored as low
risk of bias, high risk of bias, and unclear for studies
with unclear or unknown risk of bias. Since this tool

23
 was developed specifically for RCTs, items from the
Downs and Black instrument10 and the Newcastle-
Ottawa Scale11 were included in the assessment. The au-
thors intended to explore selective outcome reporting
through sensitivity analyses in cases where missing data
were likely to introduce serious bias; however, none of
these factors were reported in the included studies.
Measures of treatment effect
For prospective cohort studies, statistically significant
( p < 0.05) within-group pre–post changes (%) were an-
alyzed. The summary measure was the weighted mean
difference (standardized mean difference [SMD]) in
change in mental health from baseline to follow-up
among transgender individuals initiating hormone
therapy. For outcomes based on a single study, mean
change scores were reported.
The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines
were followed for data synthesis.9 Data were collated
into evidence tables and grouped according to each
outcome. The reported primary and secondary outcome
variables were grouped as follows: Primary: psychological
functioning, depression, anxiety, somatization, interper-
sonal sensitivity, hostility, phobic anxiety; and Secondary:
quality of life.
Data analysis
Data were analyzed using RevMan software and reported
according to Cochrane Collaboration criteria.9 A sum-
mary statistic for each study was created where possible.
A generic inverse variance method was used to create a
weighted average for each study according to the amount
of information in each study and a fixed-effects model
was employed. For continuous data, pooled outcomes
were expressed as SMDs with associated 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) when outcomes used different scales or
different versions of the same scale. When outcomes
used the same scale, the weighted mean difference was
used and 95% CIs reported.
To avoid a unit of analysis error, several different
outcomes based on different periods of follow-up
were defined and not combined in a meta-analysis.
When missing data were found, the data were assumed
to be missing at random. Only available data were an-
alyzed and missing data were ignored.
Inconsistency in treatment effects across studies
was quantified using the I2 statistic, which represents
the proportion of variability across trials that is not
attributable to random error or chance.9 Assessment
of heterogeneity was made based on the following
levels: none <25%, low = 25–49%, moderate = 50–
74%, and high = 75% + .8 Since study outcomes and
measurement were too heterogeneous, a narrative
synthesis was performed.
Results
Figure 1 depicts the study selection process. Three
studies that met inclusion criteria were identified.12–14
Of the three studies, data were available for a total of
154 participants (two studies) for the primary psycholog-
ical functioning outcomes;12,14 one study reported on sec-
ondary quality of life outcomes (n=83).13 Lack of data
and variation in follow-up period of assessment time
points precluded meta-analysis for the reviewed studies.
Study characteristics
In all three studies, a cohort of transgender patients ini-
tiating hormone therapy was followed longitudinally
after initiating hormone therapy at baseline. The timing
of follow-up for these studies ranged from 3 to 6 months
and 12 months after baseline. One study used a 3–6-
month follow-up14 and two used a 12-month follow-
up.12,13 One study14 followed participants beyond 12
months after completion of gender affirmation surgery;
however, this time point was not included in the ana-
lyses as per the protocol. All studies lacked a control
group.
The three studies enrolled 247 participants (180
MTF, 67 FTM). Only two studies reported the age of
participants,12,13 and the mean age for MTF individuals
across studies was similar to FTM individuals (mean
age 31 and 30, respectively). All three of the included
studies originated in Europe (two in Italy; one in Bel-
gium) and were published in English.
Participants were all recruited from specialty gender
identity clinics serving patients diagnosed with having
gender identity disorder (prior DSM diagnosis for gen-
der dysphoria). Patients were recruited into the study
during a routine visit and all were seeking surgical gen-
der affirmation surgery (i.e., sex reassignment surgery).
All three studies administered hormone therapy fol-
lowing diagnosis of gender identity disorder. All partic-
ipants lived full-time in their gender role (socially
transitioned) and were receiving concurrent psycho-
therapy. Specific details of the hormone regimen were
reported by two studies, which used similar regimens.
Both studies administered either transdermal or oral es-
trogen and antiandrogens to MTF patients, although
dosing varied.12,13 For FTM patients, both studies used
intramuscular injections of testosterone, although dosing

24
 quantity and frequency differed and one study provided
daily low-dose transdermal gel testosterone at the begin-
ning of the treatment period (10–15 days).13
The outcomes were ascertained by a self-reported
questionnaire in all three studies. Two studies adminis-
tered assessments in the clinic and one mailed the ques-
tionnaire to the participants at follow-up, resulting in
missing data. Two studies used the Symptom Checklist-
90 (SCL-90) to assess psychological functioning.12,14
However, one study12 used the Italian revised version
(SCL-90-R)15 and the other study14 used the traditional
Dutch-adapted version.16 Two studies assessed anxi-
ety;12,14 however, only one12 used a validated scale
(Zung Self-Reported Anxiety Scale).17 One study12
also measured depression using a second validated de-
pression measure (Zung Depression Scale).18 Only one
study assessed quality of life as a secondary outcome13
and used the World Health Organization Quality of
Life-100 (WHOQOL-100) questionnaire.19

SCL-90 (revised version, Italian version;12 Dutch-
adapted SCL-9014), with one study assessing outcomes
at 3–6 months posthormone initiation14 and the other
assessing outcomes at 12 months posthormone initia-
tion.12 One study12 used additional measures for anx-
iety and depression (Zung scale), the outcomes of
which are reported below. All psychological function-
ing outcomes were measured continuously with mean
change scores reported for the SCL-90 and for the
Zung depression and anxiety scales (see summary of
findings: Table 1).

 Global score of psychological functioning.
The SCL-
90-R Italian version provides a global score of psycho-
logical functioning (Global Severity Index), while the
SCL-90 Dutch version provides an overall psychoneu-
rotic distress score, which are similar, but scored differ-
ently. Both studies measuring overall psychiatric distress
saw a significant change in global distress scores at
follow-up: SMD = �0.52 [95% CI: �0.79, �0.25] (12
months of follow-up)12 and �0.88 [95% CI: �1.29,
�0.48] (3–6 months of follow-up).14
Depression.
Participants in both studies had depres-
sion scores in the normal range at baseline as indicated
by the SCL-90-R Italian version depression sub-
scale, Zung Depression Scale,12 and SCL-90 Dutch de-
pression subscale.14 Nonetheless, the SCL-90-R Italian
version12 and SCL-90 Dutch version each showed
statistically significant reductions in depression post-
hormone therapy across the two studies with an SMD
of �0.51 [95% CI: �0.78, �0.24] (12-month follow-
up)12 and �0.89 [95% CI:�1.30, �0.48] (3–6 months of
follow-up).14 One study also assessed depression scores
using the Zung Depression Scale and saw a similar sta-
tistically significant reduction at 12-month follow-up
(mean difference= �8.06 (95% CI: �10.91, �5.21).12
Meta-analysis of these two studies was precluded due
to statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 0%) and disparate
follow-up periods.

 Anxiety.
Two studies measured changes in anxiety
scores from baseline to 3–6-month14 and 12-month12
posthormone therapy initiation using the SCL-90 anxi-
ety subscale (SCL-90-R Italian version;12 SCL-90 Dutch
version14). One study also used an additional validated
continuous measure of anxiety (Zung Anxiety Scale).12
The SCL-90 anxiety subscales showed higher than
normal anxiety for participants in both studies at base-
line (mean = 1.05, SD = 0.94; normal <1.0;12 mean= 17.0,
SD = 6.4; general population mean =12.8, SD= 4.4).14 At
follow-up, both studies saw a statistically significant re-
duction in anxiety with scores in the normal range at
3–6-month follow-up (mean= 12.4, SD = 5.1)14 and 12-
month follow-up (mean = 0.54, SD = 0.56),12 as well as
significant standardized mean change scores (
�0.66
[95% CI:�0.93,�0.38];12�0.78 [95% CI:�1.18,�0.38]14).
One study also showed a reduction in anxiety using a
different continuous measure (Zung Anxiety) from
above the normal range at baseline (mean = 44.91,
SD= 9.59; normal = 24–44) to within the normal range
at 12-month follow-up (mean= 37.90, SD= 8.97)12 and
this change was highly significant (mean differ-
ence = �7.01 [95% CI: �9.50, �4.52]).
Somatization.
Two studies assess somatization as
a subscale measure in the SCL-90 (SCL-90-R Italian
version;12 SCL-90 Dutch version14). One study had
somatization scores within the normal range at base-
line (mean= 0.54, SD = 0.59; normal <1.0).12 The other
study had significantly higher baseline somatization
scores compared with the general population at baseline
(mean = 18.6, SD = 6.7; general population mean= 16.7,
SD= 5.3);14 however, scores remained significantly
higher than the general population even at 3–6-month
follow-up (mean = 15.2, SD = 2.7). Nonetheless, both
studies saw a significant reduction in somatization scores
posthormone therapy initiation as measured by mean
change scores at 3–6-month follow-up (�0.64 [95% CI:
�1.04, �0.24])14 and 12-month follow-up (�0.38 [95%
CI:�0.65,�0.10]).12
Interpersonal sensitivity.
Two studies assessed inter-
personal sensitivity using the SCL-90 (SCL-90-R Italian
version;12 SCL-90 Dutch version14). Participants in one
study had significantly higher scores than the general
population at baseline (mean = 31.8, SD = 11.7; general
population mean = 24.1, SD = 7.6).14 The other study
had normal interpersonal sensitivity scores at baseline
(mean = 0.97, SD = 0.82; normal <1.0).12 Participants
in both studies evinced a significant reduction in stan-
dardized mean change scores posthormone initia-
tion at 3–6-month follow-up (SMD = �0.70 [95% CI:
�1.10, �0.30])14 and 12-month follow-up (SMD=
�0.47 [95% CI:�0.75,�0.20]).12 One study showed a re-
duction in interpersonal sensitivity scores that no longer
differed significantly from those of the general popula-
tion at 3–6-month follow-up (mean = 16.6, SD = 7.0; gen-
eral population mean= 24.6, SD= 7.9).14 While both
studies12,14 lacked statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 0%), the
interpersonal sensitivity outcomes were measured at dif-
ferent time points (12 months;12 3–6 months14), making
meta-analysis inappropriate.
Hostility.
Using the SCL-90, two studies assessed hos-
tility (SCL-90-R Italian version;12 SCL-90 Dutch ver-
sion).14 Participants in both studies had hostility
scores in the normal range, consistent with that of
the general population (mean = 0.57, SD = 0.69; normal
<1.0;12 mean = 8.2, SD = 3.0; general population mean =
7.2, SD = 2.1).14 Nonetheless, both studies showed a re-
duction in hostility scores posthormone therapy initia-
tion, although the reduction was not statistically
significant at 3–6 month follow-up (SMD = �0.31
[95% CI:�0.70,�0.08])14 and the other was statistically
significant at 12-month follow-up (SMD = �0.34 [95%
CI: �0.61, �0.07]).12 One study demonstrated a reduc-
tion in scores to a similar level as the general popula-
tion at 3–6 month follow-up (mean = 7.4, SD = 2.0;
general population mean = 7.2, SD = 2.1).14
Phobic anxiety.
Two studies assessed phobic anxiety
using the SCL-90 (SCL-90-R Italian version;12 SCL-90
Dutch version).14 Participants in one study had phobic
anxiety scores in the normal range before initiating
hormone therapy (mean = 0.53, SD = 0.61; normal
<1.0).12 The other study had phobic anxiety called ag-
oraphobia in the SCL-90 Dutch version14 scores that
were significantly higher than the general population
at baseline (mean = 9.5, SD = 4.2; general population
mean = 7.9, SD = 2.3).14
Both studies saw a statistically significant change in
phobic anxiety scores from baseline to follow-up
(SMD =�0.37 [95% CI: �0.64, �0.10];12 SMD = �0.42
[95% CI: �0.81, �0.03]),14 with one study showing a re-
duction in phobic anxiety in scores to a level that was
similar to those of the general population (mean = 8.1,
SD = 1.8; general population mean = 7.9, SD =2.3).14
Quality of life.
Only one study (n = 83) assessed quality
of life using the validated WHOQOL-100 questionnaire.

 Mean baseline scores and 12-month postintervention
follow-up scores are reported overall and by subgroup
(MTF/FTM). The study reported data for subgroups
(MTF/FTM) and the mean follow-up scores were calcu-
lated for the full sample. The mean standard deviations
for both subgroups were not reported and the p-value
from the paired t-tests was only reported for the MTF
subgroup, thus it was not possible to calculate a standard
deviation for the full sample and compare pre/post
means. Thus, findings must be considered in light of
lack of reported data. See summary of findings (Table 1).
One study reported on general quality of life.13 At
baseline, general quality of life, as measured through
the WHOQOL-100, was in the normal/good range (i.e.,
‡50) at 62.74. At follow-up, the quality of life score in-
creased to 71.08 (max = 100); however, the significance
of this increase cannot be determined. Among MTF par-
ticipants, paired t-tests showed a significant increase in
overall quality of life from 62.5 to 72.2 (p < 0.05) at 12-
month follow-up. For FTM participants, increases were
observed (63.25 [baseline]; 68.75 [follow-up]); however,
the increase in overall quality of life was not significant.13
Given that only one study reported on quality of life out-
comes, meta-analysis was not possible.
Methodological quality
See summary of findings (Table 1) and risk of bias (Fig.
2). The overall quality of evidence is low. While the stud-
ies used a prospective design, which is better quality than
one-time cross-sectional studies, all studies lacked a con-
trol group. No studies used a randomized design. More-
over, all outcomes were based on self-report, which is
subject to bias. However, all the measures used were
based on psychometrically valid and reliable scales.
One confounding factor is that all studies provided
psychotherapy to patients as part of standard of care
for their clinic and all patients socially transitioned
while accessing hormone therapy. While concurrent
psychotherapy is often accessed by transgender pa-
tients on hormone therapy, and transgender patients
have generally socially transitioned before initiating
hormones, the effects of psychotherapy and social transi-
tion on mental health outcomes could have masked the
true effects of hormone therapy on the mental health of
patients. The studies were careful, however, to exclude
participants with serious untreated psychiatric comorbid-
ities (e.g., schizophrenia, substance abuse, and personality
disorder).
Many studies failed to assess important confounders
such as access to other medical gender affirmation
technologies (e.g., surgeries) and none of the studies
adjusted for confounders in their results such as the
use of psychotropic medications.
Discussion
Although the studies differ with regard to outcome
measures and most studies have methodological short-
comings, the three prospective cohort studies reviewed
here offer provisional conclusions about the effects of
hormone therapy on the psychological functioning of
transgender individuals accessing it. Two studies12,14
reported on psychological functioning and found a sta-
tistically significant reduction in depression, somatiza-
tion, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, hostility, and
phobic anxiety/agoraphobia after initiating hormone
therapy, with one study observing significant results
3–6 months posthormone initiation and the other 12
months posthormone initiation. There is insufficient

 evidence about whether changes in quality of life occur
for FTM individuals who initiate hormone therapy.
However, low quality evidence suggests that quality
of life may be improved for MTF individuals accessing
hormone therapy.
Findings support and extend the findings of another
review,7 which provided very low quality evidence that
hormone therapy may improve the mental health of
transgender people. However, the prior systematic re-
view, which included 28 studies, assessed the effects
of hormone therapy together with sex reassignment
surgery on mental health, psychological functioning,
sexual functioning, and quality of life and thus was un-
able to parse out the effects of hormone therapy sepa-
rately from surgical interventions.
Given that many transgender people may never ac-
cess sex reassignment surgery, it was important to
study the effects of hormones alone with regard to
mental health and quality of life outcomes. Moreover,
the majority of studies included in the prior review
were cross-sectional and none of the studies assessing
mental health or psychological functioning used pro-
spective study designs with a follow-up period of 3
months or more. Furthermore, the only studies that in-
cluded a control group in the prior review assessed sex
reassignment surgery and hormone therapy together,
without comparing hormone therapy with an un-
treated control. Nonetheless, the prior review did find
that the studies assessing sex reassignment surgery to-
gether with hormone therapy were strongly associated
with improved psychological functioning,7 thus find-
ings from the current review extend these results.
Like the previous systematic review,7 results of this
review demonstrate low quality evidence (previous re-
view demonstrated very low quality evidence), suggest-
ing that hormonal therapies given to individuals
diagnosed with having gender identity disorder (i.e.,
gender dysphoria) improve psychological functioning.
However, unlike the previous review, this review is un-
able to offer conclusive evidence regarding the effects of
hormone therapy on quality of life for transgender in-
dividuals overall.
Contrary to the prior review,7 which found that
MTF transgender people may have worse outcomes
than FTM individuals, the study reviewed here found
that MTF individuals had statistically significant im-
provements in quality of life 12 months after initiating
hormone therapy, while FTM individuals did not expe-
rience increases that reached statistical significance,
which was likely due to the small sample size.13 Addi-
tional research is needed to confirm quality of life re-
sults overall and by gender subgroups.
Limitations regarding potential sources of bias in the
review process should be noted. Three databases were
used to identify studies for inclusion in this review and
the search was limited to studies published in English.
These search limitations may have resulted in the loss
of relevant studies and influenced the results of the re-
view. However, the electronic search was supplemented
by checking references and citations of other articles,
which yielded additional studies. Moreover, while the
field of transgender health is truly global, English repre-
sents the predominant scientific publication language,
thus significant findings, using less biased observational
results, would have been likely to be published in English.
Nonstatistically significant findings may not have been
published in English (i.e., publication bias). Nonetheless,
it is feasible that all relevant studies have been identified.
Additionally, study identification was completed by a
single reviewer (the first author) in consultation with
an expert reference librarian and researchers with exper-
tise in systematic reviews. While the reviewer thoroughly
conducted the search and review process, it is possible
that studies that met inclusion criteria were not included
in the review or were subject to a single reviewer’s biases.
The restriction to prospective cohort studies also
meant that the reviewer was unable to consider data
from other types of evaluations of hormone therapy in-
terventions such as one-time cross-sectional studies or
qualitative evaluations. Although prospective cohorts
are a stronger design than cross-sectional studies due
to temporal ordering of exposure and outcomes, the
cohort studies in this review were subject to a number
of biases and other limitations (see the risk of bias sec-
tion above and Fig. 2).
Uncontrolled prospective cohort studies suggest that
hormonal therapies given to individuals diagnosed with
having gender identity disorder (i.e., gender dysphoria)
likely improve psychological functioning 3–12 months
after initiating hormone therapy. Findings from the re-
view support current clinical care guidelines such as the
WPATH Standards of Care,6 which recommend the use
of hormone therapy as a treatment option to reduce
gender dysphoria. Future research should assess the ef-
fects of hormone therapy on the mental health of trans-
gender individuals using more robust study designs,
including those which utilize clinician-delivered mental
health outcome measures, longitudinal designs with
control groups, and those examining U.S.-based trans-
gender people over time.
