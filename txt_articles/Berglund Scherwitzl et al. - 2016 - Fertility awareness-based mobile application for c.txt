ABSTRACT
Objectives: The aim of the study was to retrospectively evaluate the effectiveness of a fertility
awareness-based method supported by a mobile-based application to prevent unwanted
pregnancies as a method of natural birth control. Methods: In a retrospective analysis, the
application’s efficiency as a contraceptive method was examined on data from 4054 women who
used the application as contraception for a total of 2085 woman-years. Results: The number of
identified unplanned pregnancies was 143 during 2053 woman-years, giving a Pearl Index of 7.0 for
typical use. Ten of the pregnancies were due to the application falsely attributing a safe day within
the fertile window, producing a perfect-use Pearl Index of 0.5. Calculating the cumulative
pregnancy probability by life-table analysis resulted in a pregnancy rate of 7.5% per year (95%
confidence interval 5.9%, 9.1% per year). Conclusions: The application appears to improve the
effectiveness of fertility awareness-based methods and can be used to prevent pregnancies if
couples consistently protect themselves on fertile days.

Introduction
Fertility monitors have become increasingly popular in recent
years as a tool to prevent pregnancies, due to rising interest
among women to abstain from hormonal contraception.[1–3]
It has been shown that the effectiveness of such devices
when correctly used can be high,[3–5] competing with
hormonal methods of birth control. These devices tell
women about their current fertility, enabling them to make
informed decisions with regard to family planning. The
disadvantages of current fertility monitors are, however, that
they are often expensive, difficult to use, make use of basic
mathematical algorithms and, in some cases, lack clinical
research.[4,6–9]
In this paper, we present a mobile-based application
(known as Natural Cycles) that is used in combination with a
conventional basal thermometer to identify ovulation and,
hence, the fertile window. The application aims to be both
safe and easy to use – two essential attributes that make a
birth control method effective.[10] The basic features and
functionalities of the application are described and the
contraceptive effectiveness is assessed through a retrospect-
ive observational study of 4054 women using the application
for 2085 woman-years.
Methods
Digital fertility monitor
The mobile application requires the input of basal body
temperature recordings and the date of menstruation.
Luteinising hormone (LH) test results are optional entry
points. The required basal thermometer and the optional LH
tests are acquired separately from the application. The users
enter their fertility-related data into a device such as a
smartphone, tablet or laptop computer.
The underlying technology is a statistical algorithm [11]
that returns a red (unsafe) or a green (safe) day to the user
depending on whether she is considered to be at risk of
getting pregnant. The algorithm computes the following
parameters and their uncertainties: ovulation day, luteal
phase, follicular phase and cycle length, and the average
temperatures of the different phases. The algorithm assigns
green days in a conservative manner. Subsequently, the
number of red days per cycle is generally greater than the
empirical value of six days.[12,13] For example, for a woman
who has a regular cycle with an average length of 28 days
and ovulates regularly on day 14, the application would show
red days from day 6 to day 16. It has been demonstrated in a
previous study [11] that the algorithm can identify the
ovulation day with high precision and that the probability of
a green day being falsely attributed within the fertile
window, surrounding the ovulation day, is 0.05%. Since
ovulation day is accurately detected, various parameters can
be tracked, such as the length and variation of the follicular
and luteal phases of the cycle and the rate of anovulatory
cycles.
The algorithm learns from previously recorded cycles from
the same woman and can provide predictions of her fertility
status and upcoming ovulation, LH and menstruation days.
The current and predicted fertility status of the individual
user is visualised through a status bar, a calendar view and a
temperature graph. Statistics of the characteristics of rec-
orded cycles are also displayed, which can be shared with
physicians. Messages based on the user’s specific data are
sent out to further advise and motivate the user to take

 measurements as frequently as possible and to repeatedly
warn her to use protection on fertile days.
In addition to menstruation, basal body temperature and
LH test results, it is also possible for the user to enter
information concerning sexual activity and personal notes. If
there is a possibility that the user has become pregnant, she
is encouraged to enter a pregnancy test result to either
confirm or contradict the pregnancy. The possibility of
pregnancy is detected by scrutinising the data to search for
a combination of: (1) delayed menstruation, identified by
comparing the time elapsed since the last ovulation with the
user’s normal luteal phase duration; and (2) consistently high
temperature levels, as progesterone increases rather than
decreases in the body if a fertilised egg has been implanted
in the uterus.[14]
All the data are stored in the company’s database and can
be exported for analysis by third, independent parties. In this
study, the researchers from the company performed the
analyses and communicated with the users, e.g., sent out the
final questionnaire via email.
Study design
This retrospective analysis observed fertile women aged 18–
45 years from Sweden. The women had registered to use the
application for the purpose of preventing pregnancies and
were included in the study based on registration from 1
August 2014 to 31 March 2015. Women were recruited using
conventional
end-consumer
marketing
techniques
(e.g.,
public relations, online and offline advertisements with
taglines such as ‘prevent pregnancies naturally’). They
purchased subscription to the application and the basal
thermometer for E50. Every user who registered for the
application agreed to share her data anonymously for
subsequent research and clinical studies performed by the
company or external researchers. Thus, every registered user
effectively became a participant in the study if the following
inclusion criteria were met:
�
The participant had to have access to the application for
at least three months during the study period.
�
The participant had to enter data for at least 20 days in
total. Each daily data point can be any kind of combin-
ation of the possible entries (menstruation, temperature,
LH test results, sexual activity or a personal note) for a
specific date.
�
The participant had to be older than 18 years and not
planning a pregnancy during the study period.
The only applied exclusion criterion was related to women
with a medical condition in whom becoming pregnant would
be dangerous to them or their fetus, as outlined in the
instructions for use of the application. Women with irregular
cycles were not excluded. No research centres, clinics or
health care professionals were involved in recruitment or
throughout the study, which was performed entirely digitally.
Because of the loose inclusion/exclusion criteria as well as
the recruitment procedure, the study participants repre-
sented a general population of women who were susceptible
to the marketing of the company, i.e., they had an interest in
natural contraception.
At registration, users were required to answer questions
related to their individual cycle, previous contraception, date
of birth, height and weight. The first registration dating from
1
August
2014
marked
the
beginning
of
the
study.
Participants were subsequently recruited from 1 August
2014 to 31 March 2015. They entered data until the study
ended on 31 August 2015 or until they dropped out due to
pregnancy or method discontinuation. Pregnancy was ini-
tially detected via the user’s data, as described above, and
secondly via an online questionnaire.
Approximately three weeks prior to the end of the study,
the participants were asked to answer an additional optional
questionnaire, sent via email. The survey contained the
questions and answers presented in Table 1, and all
questions were optional, except the question whether she
had become pregnant (Q6), which was mandatory to answer
to complete the survey. The answers were collected no later
than 31 August 2015. Of 4054 women participating in the
study, 1233 women completed the survey.
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the
regional ethics committee (EPN, Stockholm, diary number
2015/1363-31/4). The retrospective study format was chosen
in order to assess for the first time the contraceptive
effectiveness of fertility awareness-based methods supported
by a mobile application. The available dataset in the
company’s database allows for a cost-effective analysis,
which provides insight for the design of future prospective
and randomised trials. It can be of interest to study the results
on contraceptive effectiveness in relation to the study design.
Pearl Index
To determine the effectiveness of the application as a
contraceptive method, the most crucial component of the
analysis was to determine the number of pregnancies among
the study participants. This information can be used to
calculate Pearl Indexes [15] for perfect and typical use.
Pregnancies were identified directly from the data of a user
entering a positive pregnancy test or by the algorithm
detecting a possible pregnancy as described above. The
answers from the questionnaire were an additional way of
determining pregnancies (Figure 1). In order to estimate the
most conservative Pearl Index, all users considered poten-
tially pregnant by the algorithm were classified as pregnant
in this study even if they failed to confirm with a pregnancy
test as requested. If it was not possible to detect a pregnancy
with any of the three methods, or to exclude the occurrence
of pregnancy from the user’s data, we classified this specific
case as unknown.
If a green day had been given within the fertile window in
a cycle where a woman had become pregnant, we con-
sidered it a method failure, irrespective of whether she had
logged intercourse and even if she had indicated unpro-
tected intercourse on red days closer to ovulation. In this
manner, the most conservative perfect-use Pearl Index was
determined independently on logged sexual behaviour.
In addition to determining the Pearl Index, life-table analysis
was used to calculate the cumulative probability of pregnancy
on a cycle basis using the Kaplan–Meier estimator.[16,17]
Results
The application was tested by 4054 participants, and a total
of 483,221 daily data entries were analysed. The participants

 on average added data on 63% of the days, of which 88%
were temperature data, 4% were LH test results and 8%
intercourse information.
The age, parity and body mass index (BMI) distribution of
the participants of the study are shown in Table 2. Table 3
shows contraceptive usage prior to use of the application, as
well as contraceptive usage for days when the application
returned red (fertile) days. In the daily data entries, the users
had the option to log information about their sexual activity.
Since it was not mandatory, users only spontaneously logged
this information. Unprotected and protected intercourse was
logged on 4.1% and 2.0% of the days, respectively, when
daily data were entered (e.g., in addition to temperature).
Participants also logged that they did not have sexual
intercourse on 2.3% of the days when they entered daily
data. When asked whether protection was used on red days,
67% of women (803 out of 1193) answered ‘yes’, 20% (237
out of 1193) answered ‘sometimes’ and 13% (153 out of
1193) answered ‘no’ (40 out of 1233 women skipped the
question).
Among the 4054 women using the application as a
contraceptive method during a total of 2085 woman-years,
143 pregnancies were identified: 123 were detected through
positive pregnancy test entries in the application; 15 of the
women were considered pregnant by the application’s
pregnancy detector; and five additional pregnancies were
found through the survey. Thirty-four percent of the women
(1397 out of 4054) discontinued using the application prior to
the end of the study. Among these dropout cases, the

 unknown. Excluding these women from the study gives a
Pearl Index of 7.0 for typical use. To estimate the most
conservative upper limit of the Pearl Index, all unknown cases
were considered as pregnant, yielding a value of 9.8. Note
that 1.8% of women (21 out of 1194) answering this question
in the survey declared that the purpose of using the device
was to plan a pregnancy, showing that they had altered their
intended use during the course of the study period. The
subset of pregnancies that could possibly have occurred
during intercourse on a green day amounted to 10 out of
3993 women, yielding a method failure for perfect use of 0.5
according to the Pearl Index. Table 4 summarises the
estimated Pearl Index values for the different scenarios.
Life-table analysis presenting the number of women
exposed to the risk of becoming pregnant and the number
of cumulative pregnancies by cycle is shown in Table 5. The
cumulative probability of pregnancy and its 95% confidence
interval (CI) were calculated according to the Kaplan–Meier
estimator [16,17] and resulted in a pregnancy probability
after 12 cycles of 6.85% (95% CI 5.06%, 8.65%). Regression
analysis based on the life-table data is shown in Figure 2 and
resulted in a fitted pregnancy rate of 7.5% per year (95% CI
5.9%, 9.1% per year), which is slightly higher than the
estimated typical-use Pearl Index of 7.0. The inset of Figure 2
shows the extrapolated non-pregnancy probability predicted
by the fitted pregnancy rate. Over a time span of 10 years, we
estimate that 52.8% (95% CI: 44.7%, 59.8%) of the women will
become pregnant.
We found that the lengths of the average cycle and luteal
phase, and their variation, were 29.9 ± 4.1 days and 12.7 ± 1.4
days (1 standard deviation [SD]), respectively. The rate of
anovulatory cycles was also monitored and found to be 5.1%.
The fraction of green days returned to the user is an
important measure of usability and depends on several
factors such as cycle regularity, length of the luteal phase,
quality of the temperature data, whether LH is measured, and
whether the user has recently used hormonal contraception.
A user with a regular cycle and normal temperature
fluctuations can expect 58 ± 12% green days (1 SD) after
the initial learning period, assuming that she regularly enters
temperature data. In general, cycles with a positive LH result
have 5% more green days than cycles with only basal body
temperature information. As the application learns from
previous data, the number of green days increases per
recorded cycle. We found that the application yields 41%
green days on average in the first recorded cycle. Women
with less than 50% green days had a 41% higher likelihood of
discontinuing the method than those with more than 50%
green days.
In the survey performed at the end of the study, several
questions were included concerning the level of satisfaction
with the application. When asked whether she was happier
since switching to using the application as a contraceptive
method, 83% of women (955 out of 1156) answered ‘yes’. In
response to the question whether she would recommend the
method to a friend, 88% of women (1038 out of 1178)
answered ‘yes’ and only 6% (75 out of 1178) answered ‘no’
(the remaining users answered ‘other’, with the addition of a
comment). Interestingly, 45% of women (64 out of 143) who
became pregnant continued to use the application after they
had entered a positive pregnancy test, either for the purpose
of tracking their pregnancy or as contraception after having
had an abortion or miscarriage.
The characteristics of the 143 women who became
pregnant while using the application were compared with
the total sample of 4054 women in the study. The average
age of the women who became pregnant was higher than
that of all participants (Figure 3a), while the BMI distribution
was determined to be equivalent within statistical uncer-
tainty (Figure 3b). In addition, the fraction of anovulatory
cycles and the fraction of women previously using hormonal
contraception are analogous. A large discrepancy was,
however, found in the rate of unprotected and protected
intercourse as seen in the daily data entries. The sample of
pregnant women had 91% more unprotected intercourse
and 49% less protected intercourse than the average woman
in the study (Figure 3c). We also saw that the users in the
pregnant sample had overall 45% more intercourse in
general.
Investigating the fertile window in the 143 cycles where a
pregnancy occurred, 51% of the women had logged unpro-
tected intercourse during the fertile window and only 3% had
logged protected intercourse. These findings thus suggest
that the majority of the pregnancies were due to lack of use
of protection rather than failure of use of a barrier method.
The fraction of green days was compared between the

average, which is not statistically significant.
Discussion
Findings and interpretation
The findings on the effectiveness of fertility awareness-based
methods vary greatly in the literature depending on the
fertility indicators used (menstruation, temperature, cervical
mucus, or a combination), the social settings (industrialised
or developing countries) and the study design itself. While a
perfect-use Pearl Index has been reported to be low (0.4-4.0)
for methods involving at least temperature or cervical mucus,
the typical-use Pearl Index ranges from 1.8 to 24.0.[5,18–21]
The World Health Organization (WHO) performed a pro-
spective study in five countries using the ovulation method,
which only investigates cervical mucus, and found an average
typical-use Pearl Index of 20.4 in the effectiveness phase, after
correction.[20] In a prospective study in Germany, the
sympto-thermal method, involving both temperature and
cervical mucus, revealed a very low typical-use rate of 1.8.[5]
Studies using computer thermometers, which are similar to
the current application, showed a typical-use rate of 3.8.[4]
The effectiveness of Natural Cycles as a contraceptive
method depends on the accuracy of the algorithm as well as
the
behaviour
of
the
user.
The
algorithm
has
been
demonstrated to have a low failure rate, with a 0.05%
probability of a green day being falsely attributed to the
fertile window.[11] The estimated perfect-use Pearl Index of
0.5 confirms the high safety of the green days returned by
the application. Considering the number of green days given
by the application during the course of this study, as well as
the probability of conception according to Wilcox et al.,[12]
one would expect 22 pregnancies if users only had unpro-
tected intercourse on green days within the fertile window.
The finding of 10 pregnancies due to method failure is thus
compatible with these results if users had unprotected
intercourse on approximately every other such green day.
The perfect-use rate is consistent with those reported on
similar devices and for the sympto-thermal method.[4,5]
In this paper, user behaviour is also evaluated by
determining a typical-use Pearl Index and Kaplan–Meier
pregnancy rate, which include pregnancies occurring from
intercourse on red (fertile) days. The resulting values of 7.0
and 7.5% per year, respectively, are significantly lower than
the general typical-use Pearl Index of 24.0 during the
Table 5. Life-table analysis presenting the number of women exposed to the risk of becoming pregnant by cycle, the number of cumulative
pregnancies, the cumulative pregnancy probability and its 95% CI. The cumulative pregnancy probability is calculated on a cycle basis,
where cycle 1 corresponds to the first cycle for which the ovulation day was detected and cycle 12 implies that the women were exposed to at
least 11 full cycles after cycle 1. 60 out of 3993 women dropped out prior to detection of their first ovulation day and are therefore censored
before cycle 1.

 first year for fertility awareness-based methods.[18,21] The
main reasons for the failure were reported to be due to a
conscious departure from abstaining or using protection on
fertile days and the inaccurate interpretation of fertility
indicators. A fertility monitor, such as that studied here, may
help to reduce these factors, since an algorithm automates
the analysis of the temperature data. According to the survey
in the present study, 74% and 32% of the participants made
use of the condom or withdrawal, respectively, during fertile
days (Table 3). Both methods have similar perfect- and
typical-use Pearl Index values of 2.0–4.0 and 18.0–22.0,
respectively.[18,21] Users are reminded through the applica-
tion that a pregnancy risk exists on a red day, which may
increase compliance with the use of a condom or withdrawal.
In addition, the participants in this study were recruited from
Sweden, a high-resource country whose inhabitants may
behave differently from participants in the WHO study in the
Philippines, India, El Salvador, Ireland and New Zealand.
Studies on German women have shown a typical-use Pearl
Index for the sympto-thermal method of 1.8 [5] and for a
computer thermometer of 3.8.[4] Both rates are lower than in
this study. The study of the computer thermometer is
perhaps most similar to this application, for which the
difference in failure rate may be explained by the study
design. The retrospective German study [4] was entirely
based on surveys sent by mail to women who had previously
purchased the device, which could lead to a downward
selection bias. The study of the sympto-thermal method [5]
showed that the commitment of the participants to abstain
or use protection on fertile days was high and that risk-taking
couples (who had unprotected intercourse) had an unin-
tended pregnancy rate of 7.5%, which is comparable to the
result in this study. The fact that two fertility indicators are
used rather than one may also lead to improved method
failure rates, whereas effective teaching and high selection
bias on recruitment may lead to low user failure rates.
It is clear that the users who became pregnant in this
study were more likely to expose themselves to risk by not
using protection on fertile days. It is thus of highest
importance to educate the user on the risks involved in
having unprotected intercourse on red days. In addition, the
finding that users who became pregnant were older indicates
that the pregnancy risk was of less importance.
Note that the safety of the algorithm is set mathematically
and was regulated to achieve a balance between high safety
of green days (low perfect-use Pearl Index) and a sufficient
number of green days both to keep users satisfied with the
method and to keep using protection on all red days (low
typical-use Pearl Index). The fraction of green days returned
to the user is similar to that of other computer thermometers
and did not seem to affect pregnancy rates.[4] A low fraction
of green days (
5
50%) does, however, lead to more dropouts.
The survey performed at the end of the study showed that
a high level of satisfaction with the application was achieved.
Conclusions from the survey must be critically assessed,
however, since only 30% responded to the survey.
Strengths and weaknesses of the study
This was a retrospective study with the disadvantages
inherent to this type of study. However, by analysing the
data that the users entered directly into the application on a
daily basis, the pregnancy status of 3965 out of 4054 women
could be detected directly by the application. Thus, the recall
bias of the study was lower in comparison with solely basing
the study on a survey performed at the end of a study
period.[4] In addition, since pregnancy status could be
determined for 98.5% of all participants (3993 out of 4054
women), the retention bias was low and the follow-up rate
high. Since participants purchased and used the application
as they would in real life, without any interaction with
physicians, which is otherwise typical of such clinical studies,
the results of this study may reflect a more accurate picture
of how women use the application.
A disadvantage of this study is its shortness. As the study
ended less than 5 months after recruiting the last partici-
pants, the average number of cycles per user was rather low
(6.3 cycles per user). Taking the dropout rate of 34% into
account, the expected one-year discontinuation rate of all
participants is estimated to be 56%, which is comparable to
the general one-year discontinuation rate for fertility aware-
ness-based methods, but worse than for oral contraceptive
pills or long-acting reversible contraceptives.[18,21] No
incentives were given to the study participants and the

 contraceptive method was not free of charge, as is usually
the case in prospective controlled trials. These factors could
have had a negative impact on the continuation rate, which
will be re-evaluated in a randomised, prospective study.
The information on sexual behaviour is limited, since it was
not mandatory for participants to log whether and when they
had protected/unprotected intercourse. Information about
intercourse was logged on 8% of the days with daily data
entries. Consequently, a calculation of perfect/imperfect use
according to Trussell and Grummer-Strawn [20] could not be
made. Instead of determining all cycles (and corresponding
pregnancies) in which the method was used perfectly by the
user, the perfect-use failure rate was determined by retro-
spectively analysing all cycles in which the algorithm failed
(e.g., falsely attributing a green day within the fertile
window). To obtain the most conservative estimate, cycles
in which a pregnancy occurred when a green day had been
falsely attributed were counted as method failure, even when
the user had not followed protocol. The relative analysis on
sexual behaviour between pregnant and non-pregnant
participants is uncertain due to the small data subset,
which makes any conclusion speculative, but the findings
are consistent with the fact that ‘risk-takers’ are more likely to
get pregnant.
Lastly, we note that the study population only contained
women who had already chosen to use the application,
which might have led to a high selection bias compared with
the average population. Also, since 92% of the women were
aged between 20 and 35 years, the results found in this study
are not relevant to other age groups (e.g., teenagers).
Differences in results and conclusions
The conclusions are based on the results from the retro-
spective analysis, but also include a comparison with other
fertility awareness-based methods [18,21] discussed above.
Relevance of the findings: implications for clinicians
and policy-makers
The findings give the first indications of the effectiveness of
the application when it is used to prevent pregnancies. We
note that to be able to directly compare its efficacy with that
of other contraceptive methods which also depend on high
user compliance, such as the combined oral contraceptive
pill and other forms of fertility awareness-based methods,
further studies are needed that randomly assign the contra-
ceptive method to the participant to avoid selection bias.
Unanswered questions and future research
Many of the limitations discussed above could be improved
by performing further studies with a longer time span and of
a prospective nature. The platform renders it possible to
perform clinical research on a large number of women and
analyse pregnancy rates as a function of geography, age, BMI,
data activity, educational level, and other potentially inter-
esting factors. Furthermore, it would be interesting to
perform a randomised, prospective clinical study that com-
pares the efficacy of the application with that of the
combined oral contraceptive pill. Such a study would
determine the Pearl Index with much less selection bias.
Conclusions
The mobile application appears to be an improvement on
traditional fertility awareness-based methods and is compar-
able to existing computer thermometers. It can be an
effective means to prevent pregnancies if couples are willing
to abstain or protect themselves on fertile days. The
algorithm removes the need for the user to perform any
analysis of fertility data herself and thus reduces the
probability of failure due to the human factor, which is
verified by the low typical-use pregnancy rate observed in
the study. The discontinuation rate remains high, similar to
other fertility awareness-based methods. Furthermore, the
platform presents an interesting approach to perform clinical
research in reproductive health in a large set of women in a
cost-effective manner.
The users’ feedback on the application as a contraceptive
method was positive and indicated that most women were
happier than with their previous contraception. Future
prospective studies with a longer time span should compare
the effectiveness and user experience of the application with
other fertility awareness-based methods as well as with
hormonal contraceptives.
