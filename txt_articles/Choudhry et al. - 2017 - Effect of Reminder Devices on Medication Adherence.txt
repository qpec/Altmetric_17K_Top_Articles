IMPORTANCE Forgetfulness is a major contributor to nonadherence to chronic disease
medications and could be addressed with medication reminder devices.
OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of 3 low-cost reminder devices on medication adherence.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This 4-arm, block-randomized clinical trial involved
53 480 enrollees of CVS Caremark, a pharmacy benefit manager, across the United States.
Eligible participants were aged 18 to 64 years and taking 1 to 3 oral medications for long-term
use. Participants had to be suboptimally adherent to all of their prescribed therapies (with a
medication possession ratio of 30% to 80%) in the 12 months before randomization.
Participants were stratified on the basis of the medications they were using at randomization:
medications for cardiovascular or other nondepression chronic conditions (the chronic
disease stratum) and antidepressants (the antidepressant stratum). In each stratum,
randomization occurred within blocks defined by whether all of the patient’s targeted
medications were dosed once daily. Patients were randomized to receive in the mail a pill
bottle strip with toggles, digital timer cap, or standard pillbox. The control group received
neither notification nor a device. Data were collected from February 12, 2013, through March
21, 2015, and data analyses were on the intention-to-treat population.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was optimal adherence (medication
possession ratio �80%) to all eligible medications among patients in the chronic disease
stratum during 12 months of follow-up, ascertained using pharmacy claims data. Secondary
outcomes included optimal adherence to cardiovascular medications among patients in the
chronic disease stratum as well as optimal adherence to antidepressants.
RESULTS Of the 53 480 participants, mean (SD) age was 45 (12) years and 56% were female.
In the primary analysis, 15.5% of patients in the chronic disease stratum assigned to the
standard pillbox, 15.1% assigned to the digital timer cap, 16.3% assigned to the pill bottle strip
with toggles, and 15.1% assigned to the control arm were optimally adherent to their
prescribed treatments during follow-up. There was no statistically significant difference in the
odds of optimal adherence between the control and any of the devices (standard pillbox:
odds ratio [OR], 1.03 [95% CI, 0.95-1.13]; digital timer cap: OR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.92-1.09]; and
pill bottle strip with toggles: OR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.85-1.04]). In direct comparisons, the odds
of optimal adherence were higher with a standard pillbox than with the pill bottle strip
(OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.00-1.21]). Secondary analyses yielded similar results.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Low-cost reminder devices did not improve adherence
among nonadherent patients who were taking up to 3 medications to treat common chronic
conditions. The devices may have been more effective if coupled with interventions to ensure
consistent use or if targeted to individuals with an even higher risk of nonadherence.

S
uboptimal adherence to medications for chronic condi-
tions, such as hypertension and diabetes, results in po-
tentially avoidable morbidity, mortality, and health care
spending.1,2 A variety of factors are responsible for patients not
taking their medications as prescribed, but up to 60% of in-
dividualsidentifyforgetfulnessastheirprimaryexplanation.1-3
Therefore, tools that remind patients to take their prescribed
medications may help improve adherence by providing vi-
sual or auditory cues and by creating good habits around rou-
tine medication taking.4-6 Particular attention has been fo-
cusedonelectronicmedication-packagingdevicesthatprovide
alerts when medications are to be taken as well as feedback
to patients and their caregivers about adherence. Unfortu-
nately, there are limited and inconsistent data supporting the
effectiveness of these devices; in many cases, their cost may
be prohibitive for wide-scale application.7
Simple and low-cost reminder devices, such as pill bottle
caps with a digital timer or nonelectronic pillboxes, could be
a cost-efficient alternative to overcoming forgetfulness. Small
studies have found that such low-cost devices improve adher-
ence to antiretroviral medications, but there are limited data
about their ability to improve the quality of medication tak-
ing in other therapeutic areas, especially in real-world natu-
ralistic settings.5,8,9 Accordingly, we conducted the Random-
ized Evaluation to Measure Improvements in Nonadherence
from Low-Cost Devices (REMIND) trial to evaluate the effect
on adherence to medications for chronic conditions com-
monly managed in primary care settings of 3 low-cost de-
vices: a pill bottle strip with toggles for each day of the week,
a pill bottle cap with a digital timer displaying the time elapsed
since the medication was last taken, and a plastic organiza-
tion box with 1 compartment for every day of the week.
Methods
Study Design
The REMIND trial was a pragmatic, block-randomized, con-
trolled, 4-arm comparative effectiveness study. Details of the
study design and protocol have been published previously.10
Theacademicauthors(N.K.C.,N.F.K.,A.A.K.,A.Y.T.,andJ.M.F.)
analyzed the data using an independent copy of the study da-
tabase and attested to the analytic accuracy and complete-
ness as well as the fidelity of the report to the trial protocol
(available in Supplement 1).
The trial was approved by the institutional review board
ofBrighamandWomen’
sHospital,Boston,Massachusetts,and
by the Chesapeake Institutional Review Board. Because the
study devices are currently available for commercial use and
because participants received the devices by mail and could
choose not to use them, patient-level consent was waived by
Chesapeake Institutional Review Board.
Study Devices
The REMIND trial evaluated 3 low-cost adherence devices: (1)
a pill bottle with an affixed strip with toggles that can be slid
after each day’
s dose has been taken (Take-n-Slide; IC Inno-
vations), (2) a pill bottle cap with a digital timer displaying the
time elapsed since the medication was last taken (Rx Timer-
Cap; TimerCap LLC), and (3) a standard plastic pillbox with 1
compartment for each day of the week (Appendix eFigure 1 in
Supplement 2).
Study Population
Inourstudy,conductedfromFebruary12,2013,throughMarch
21,2015,weenrolledindividualsaged18to64yearswhosepre-
scription drug benefits were administered by CVS Caremark,
a large pharmacy benefits manager that provides coverage to
more than 65 million individual members in the United States.
Weincludedonlycommerciallyinsuredindividualswhoseplan
sponsor had provided permission to contact their members for
this study and who were continuously eligible for pharmacy
benefits in the 12 months before the start of the study. Thus,
individuals aged 65 years or older, for whom Medicare is typi-
cally the primary payer and for whom accurate outcome data
would not be available, were excluded.
Eligible patients were identified using prescription claims
data. To be included, patients must have filled between 1 and
3 oral maintenance medications for the treatment of cardio-
vascular disease (ie, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary
artery disease, congestive heart failure, or diabetes), another
nondepression chronic condition (ie, breast cancer; benign
prostatic hypertrophy; schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and
anxiety; arrhythmia; Parkinson disease; or seizure and epi-
lepsy); or depression in the 12 months before February 2014,
when eligibility for the study was evaluated (see eTable 1 in
Supplement 2 for the study medications and eFigure 2 in
Supplement 2 for the study timeline). We restricted poten-
tially eligible individuals to those taking 3 or fewer medica-
tions to limit the number of devices that patients with more
complex treatment regimens may be required to use at any
point (Figure 1).
In addition, to target individuals who may have been most
likely to benefit from efforts to improve adherence, we re-
quired participants to have been suboptimally adherent to all
of their qualifying oral maintenance medications during the
12 months prior to randomization. Adherence was assessed
using prescription drug claims, and suboptimal adherence was
defined as a medication possession ratio (MPR) between 30%
and 80%. The 30% threshold was selected so that those pa-
tients in the cohort who normally filled more medications with
every dispensation (eg, 90-day supply) would have filled at
Key Points
Question To what extent can 3 low-cost reminder devices
improve medication adherence among individuals who are
receiving therapy but are poorly adherent?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 53 480 enrollees of a
pharmacy benefit manager, no statistically significant difference in
adherence was found between those in the control group and
those who received a reminder device (pill bottle strip with
toggles, digital timer cap, or standard pillbox).
Meaning Future research should focus on effective targeting of
interventions and strategies that ensure sustained medication use.

least twice in the year before randomization and thus would
have had some consistency in their medication use. The MPR
is a highly valid and widely used measure of long-term
adherence.11,12
Randomization and Study Procedures
Because antidepressants, unlike the other medication classes
in this study, are generally not intended for lifelong use, we
stratified participants prior to randomization on the basis of
antidepressants being their only eligible medication
(Figure 1).13-15 As a result, stratum 1 (the chronic disease stra-
tum) consisted of patients who took and were suboptimally
adherenttoupto3medicationsforcardiovascularorothernon-
depression chronic conditions. Stratum 2 (the antidepressant
stratum) consisted of patients whose only qualifying medica-
tion was an antidepressant.
Within each of the 2 strata, randomization occurred
within blocks defined by whether all of the patient’
s targeted
medications were dosed once daily. Patients with at least 1
medication dosed more than once daily (blocks B and D)
were not eligible for the pill bottle strip with toggles, which
can be used only for medications dosed once per day, and
were randomized to 1 of 3 intervention arms. Within each
block, randomization was carried out in a 2:1 ratio between
each of the device and control arms. Patients who were ran-
domized to one of the intervention arms received a free
device in the mail along with an information card explaining
how to use the device as well as whom and what telephone
number to call to obtain additional information during the
trial. Patients who were randomized to the pill bottle strip
with toggles arm or the digital timer cap arm received 1
device for each targeted medication. Patients who were ran-
domized to the standard pillbox arm received 1 device to use
for all of their medications.
Studydevicesweremailedacross4daysinlateMarch2014
by US Postal Service first-class mail. Individuals randomized
to the control arm were not contacted and did not receive any
of the devices. Because the receipt dates for each patient are
notpreciselyknown,thelastdayofthemailingperiodwasused
as the start of follow-up for all participants. During the 6-week
period between targeting and deploying the study devices, a
small proportion of enrolled patients lost insurance eligibil-
ity and thus received the devices but could not be included in
the analysis (Figure 1).
Study Outcomes
The study’
s primary outcome was a binary measure of opti-
mal adherence during the 12-month follow-up period to all car-
diovascular or nondepression chronic disease medications for
participants in the chronic disease stratum. For each eligible
medication, an MPR was first calculated using administrative
pharmacy claims. Patients were defined as being optimally ad-
herent if their MPR was equal to or greater than 80% for each
and all of their eligible medications. Patients who lost insur-
ance eligibility during follow-up were censored at their first eli-
gibility gap of greater than 7 days, and outcomes were calcu-
lated over this truncated period.
Secondaryoutcomeswerecalculatedinananalogousman-
ner and included optimal adherence to cardiovascular medi-
cations among participants targeted for these medications in
the chronic disease stratum1 and optimal adherence to anti-
depressants in the antidepressant stratum.2

Statistical Analysis
We randomized 37 532 patients in the chronic disease stra-
tum to achieve more than 80% power to detect a 1% differ-
ence in the percentage of patients who were optimally adher-
ent between each of the individual intervention arms and
controls as well as between each 2-way comparison of active
arms, assuming that 2% of patients in the control group were
optimally adherent, and an α of 5%. The randomization se-
quencewasgeneratedusingPROCSURVEYSELECTwithafixed
seed in SAS Enterprise Guide 5.1 (SAS Institute Inc).
All analyses were performed on the basis of the intention-
to-treatprinciple.Wecalculatedmeansandfrequenciesofpre-
randomizationvariablesseparatelybystudyarm.Wealsocom-
pared the average length of follow-up by study arm.
In the primary analyses, all outcomes were compared
between study arms using standard logistic regression. We
accounted for differences in level of optimal adherence for
patients in each block by adjusting for block in the regression
model. In a subsequent analysis, we compared outcomes
between study arms using a generalized estimating equation
with a logit link to account for clustering of participants
within participating employers. We also evaluated adher-
ence as a continuous measure, calculated as the average
MPR across targeted medications, using linear regression.
Finally, we conducted subgroup analyses of the primary out-
come, stratifying our population by sex, age (<50 years vs
≥50 years), adherence level prior to randomization (MPR
<0.55 vs ≥0.55), and number of targeted maintenance medi-
cations (between 1 and 3).
Results
Of the 53 480 potentially eligible participants, 1.5% to 2% of pa-
tients in each study arm lost insurance eligibility between tar-
getinganddeployingthedevices.Thefinalsamplesizeforanaly-
sis was 36 739 in the chronic disease stratum and 15 555 in the
antidepressant stratum. See Figure 1 for more information.

strip with toggles arm (Figure 2A). In logistic models compar-
ing study arms to controls and adjusted for study block, the
odds of full adherence were not substantially different among
the intervention arms or controls (Table 2). In direct compari-
sons between devices, patients randomized to receive a
pillbox had a statistically significant 10% higher odds of opti-
mal adherence than those randomized to receive a pill bottle
strip with toggles (odds ratio [OR], 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00-1.21).

Analyses were similar when accounting for the clustering of
patients within employers (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.98-1.24; eTable
2inSupplement2).Acrosssubgroups,maleswiththepillbottle
strip with toggles had substantially higher adherence than did
females with the same device, and patients with higher lev-
els of adherence before randomization responded better to the
digital timer cap (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01-1.15) than did patients
with lower prerandomization levels of adherence (OR, 0.96;
95% CI, 0.90-1.03; P value for interaction = .02). Effects across
other subgroups, defined by sex and number of medications
taken at randomization, were consistent (Table 3).
Analyses of secondary outcomes were consistent with
those of the primary outcome (Table 2 and Figure 2B and C).
None of the devices differed substantially from the control arm
with respect to optimal adherence to cardiovascular medica-
tions or antidepressants. In direct comparisons, patients ran-
domized to the pillbox arm had a 14% higher odds of optimal
adherence to antidepressants than patients randomized to the
digital timer cap arm (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.02-1.29; Table 2).
Analyses considering adherence as a continuous outcome cal-
culated as the mean MPR across eligible medications also
yielded similar results (eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
Inthispragmatic,comparative-effectivenessrandomizedclini-
cal trial of more than 50 000 individuals who took up to 3 long-
term medications to treat chronic conditions but were non-
adherenttothesetherapies,3low-costdevices—pillbottlestrip
with toggles, digital timer cap, and standard pillbox—did not
improve medication adherence. In head-to-head compari-
sons of individual devices, patients who received the stan-
dard pillbox tended to have higher adherence than patients
who received the digital timer cap and the pill bottle strip with
toggles, although these effects were of relatively small mag-
nitude and were of inconsistent statistical significance.
There are several potential explanations for our null find-
ings. First, we selected for inclusion those patients who had
suboptimal adherence and then we anticipated that, during
our yearlong follow-up, 2% of our controls would become
optimally adherent. In contrast, we observed that 12% to 18%
of controls actually became optimally adherent without spe-
cific intervention. This finding is consistent with recent
observations that adherence, like other health behaviors, is
dynamic, with a sizable proportion of previously nonadher-
ent patients demonstrating periods of adherence and vice
versa.16,17 As such, it may have been preferable to instead tar-
get patients who were predicted to be nonadherent in the
future (by using recently described methods, for example)
rather than target those who were nonadherent at the point
of randomization.18,19
Second, in an intention-to-treat framework, low uptake or
inconsistent use could have obscured any true effects among
those who used the devices regularly. Our study was powered
to detect a 1% mean improvement in the rate of optimal adher-
enceundertheassumptionthatapproximately20%ofpatients
in the intervention arms would use the devices. In a survey of
618 patients randomized to one of the intervention arms con-
ductedinthethirdmonthoffollow-up,morethan68%reported
using the devices.However, given the overall null results of the
intervention, such use either was not sustained in the yearlong
follow-up or did not lead to measurable changes in the rate of
filling. In some cases, patients may not have used the devices
asintended;althoughaninformationcardaccompaniedthede-
vices, 40% of those surveyed either did not read the card or

cies could have prevented some patients from using the timer
capdevice.Thosesurveyedfrequentlyreporteddifficultieswith
putting on and taking off the digital timer cap device. The fact
that the standard pillbox, ubiquitous in pharmacies and other
caresettings,resultedinmarginallygreaterimprovementsinad-
herence than the other two devices may suggest that familiar-
ity and comfort with a device could have facilitated uptake and
the resultant behavior change.
Third, to be pragmatic, the mailing of devices was not co-
ordinated with actual medication refills. Thus, patients may
have had difficulty transitioning to the device in the middle
of a prescription fill. Or patients may have not used the de-
vicesatalliftheirmedicationrefillhadlapsedcompletely,leav-
ing them without medication to put in the device at the time
it was received.
Another possible explanation for our findings is that these
devices simply do not improve adherence. These 3 devices are
simple by design, intended to be intuitive to use, and mini-
mally disruptive. However, for patients without established
routines around medication taking, the additional cues from
these devices may not be sufficient to overcome forgetful-
ness. Moreover, the devices may not have promoted periodic
medication refilling, which is necessary for long-term adher-
ence. For these devices to work, they may need to be admin-
istered with additional support mechanisms.
Alternatively, although forgetfulness is the most fre-
quent barrier to adherence that patients report, this factor may
not have been the primary driver of nonadherence in our study
population. For example, a common theme in the patient sur-
vey for the trial participants was a belief that adherence was
not a problem for them, suggesting that gaps in knowledge or
motivation could have been the primary contributors to sub-
optimal medication taking. Similarly, because nonadherence
is a multidimensional problem, addressing forgetfulness alone
may have been insufficient to improve actual medication
taking. This idea is consistent with the modest effects seen in
other studies that address single barriers, such as high out-
of-pocket medication costs.20 Conversely, multicomponent
interventions, particularly those led by pharmacists, appear
to be effective. Trials are now being conducted to test ways to

performance reports drawn from routinely collected admin-

Limitations
This study has several limitations. Our multiarm study de-
sign necessitated making multiple comparisons and conduct-
ing several hypothesis tests. Thus, the few statistically signifi-
cant findings reported here could be the result of chance.
A small proportion of patients lost insurance eligibility be-
fore the devices were mailed, and another set of patients lost
eligibility during follow-up. We did not observe substantial dif-
ferences in the loss-to-follow-up rate between study arms be-
cause much of this loss to follow-up can be attributed to nor-
mal insurance churn. A higher-than-anticipated proportion of
control patients were observed to be adherent during follow-
up; however, given that almost no effect was observed across
any comparisons in our study, we do not believe the interpre-
tation of our results would change. Targeting for the trial and
the outcomes were evaluated using medication dispensing
data. Such data sources have been demonstrated to be valid
and accurate measures of medication-taking behavior,23 but
some misclassification of actual use could have occurred if pa-
tients stopped taking their medications midway through a fill.
Similarly, claims data do not allow for the differentiation of pa-
tients who are intermittent users from patients who have dis-
continuedtherapyaltogether.Suchmisclassificationcouldun-
dermineourmeasurementoftheeffectivenessofthesedevices
in improving adherence. Given the minimal impact of these
devices in improving rates of medication filling, we do not ex-
pect the devices to have differentially caused patients to stop
taking their medications midway through a fill.23
Included in our list of targeted medications were anxio-
lytics. Although these drugs are used by many patients for
long periods, they are not intended for lifelong use. For very
few patients, an anxiety medication was the only drug that
qualified them for inclusion in the chronic disease stratum;
we found this to be reassuring, and our results were virtually
identical in our prespecified analysis restricted to cardiovas-
cular medications. Our trial population consisted of patients
who were continuously enrolled in a commercial pharmacy
benefits manager for 12 to 24 months and who were taking
between 1 and 3 maintenance medications. Some of these
patients may have been simultaneously enrolled in an auto-
refill program; however, we expect the distribution of
enrolled patients to be balanced by design. Finally, our
results may not be fully generalizable to older and/or
Medicare-insured populations and to those with greater
medication maintenance complexity.24
Conclusions
In a large, pragmatic, comparative-effectiveness randomized
clinical trial of patients across a broad range of chronic condi-
tions, low-cost devices did not measurably improve medica-
tionadherence.Futureresearchshouldfocusoneffectivestrat-
