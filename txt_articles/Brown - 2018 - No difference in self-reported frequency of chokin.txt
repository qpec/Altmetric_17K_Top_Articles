Abstract 
1 
Background: Baby-led weaning where infants self feed family foods during the period 
2 
they are introduced to solid foods is growing in popularity. The method may promote 
3 
healthier eating patterns but concerns have been raised regarding its safety. This study 
4 
therefore explored choking frequency amongst babies being introduced to solid foods 
5 
using a baby-led or traditional spoon-fed approach.  
6 
Methods: 1151 mothers with an infant aged 4 – 12 months reported how they introduced 
7 
solid foods to their infant (following a strict BLW, loose BLW or traditional weaning style) 
8 
and frequency of spoon-feeding and puree use (% of mealtimes). Mothers recalled if their 
9 
infant had ever choked and if so how many times and on what type of food (smooth 
10 
puree, lumpy puree, finger food and specific food examples).  
11 
Results: 13.6% of infants (n = 155) had ever choked. No significant association was found 
12 
between weaning style and ever choking, or frequency of spoon or puree use and ever 
13 
choking. For infants who had ever choked, infants following a traditional weaning 
14 
approach experience significantly more choking episodes for finger foods [F (2, 147) = 
15 
4.417, p=.014] and lumpy purees [F (2, 131) = 6.46, p=.002] than infants following a strict 
16 
or loose baby-led approach.  
17 
Conclusions: Baby-led weaning was not associated with increased risk of choking and the 
18 
highest frequency of choking on finger foods occurred in those who were given finger 
19 
foods the least often. However the limitations of non-causal results, a self-selecting 
20 
sample and reliability of recall must be emphasised.

1. Introduction 
26 
Baby-led weaning refers to the method of introducing solid foods to infants where the infant is 
27 
allowed to self-feed family foods rather than being spoon-fed pureed foods1. Despite popularity of 
28 
the baby-led weaning approach growing stronger over the last decade,2  it is still not considered in 
29 
guidelines for new parents, in part due to an emerging but small evidence base3. Although the 
30 
method may promote healthier eating and weight gain patterns4, 5 (though not all evidence is 
31 
conclusive6), concerns are often voiced by professionals about the safety of the method, particularly 
32 
around potential choking risk7,8.  
33 
 
34 
Research that has explored the potential risk of choking amongst babies being introduced to solid 
35 
foods suggests that although choking (as a one off event) appears fairly commonplace, there is no 
36 
increased risk amongst babies who are self-feeding solid foods. In two studies in New Zealand, 
37 
although around a third of babies in both studies8,9 experienced at least one choking episode, there 
38 
was no difference in occurrence between infants following a baby-led or standard weaning 
39 
approach9. Likewise, an examination of choking occurrence in a randomized controlled trial 
40 
examining nutritional intake and weight gain of infants assigned to a baby-led or traditional approach 
41 
found no significant difference in choking occurrence between the two groups10. Conversely, the sole 
42 
study in the UK that examined choking risk via a questionnaire reported that 93.5% of infants had 
43 
never had a choking episode, although this study relied on recall of the early weaning period by 
44 
mothers with preschool children5.  
45 
 
46 
Concern however remains around the method. Furthermore, although showing a positive trend that 
47 
baby-led weaning does not appear to increase choking incidences, limitations of the existing research 
48 
include relatively small samples (<200 infants in each case) and a simplified classification of baby-led 
49 
versus traditional weaning, whereby mothers were asked to identify as being part of one group. 
50 
Other research examining baby-led weaning has asked mothers to self define their approach but has 
51 
also measured frequency of spoon feeding and puree use, both to clarify whether chosen approach 
52 
matches behavior but also to enable more detailed analysis of weaning approach based on degree of 
53 
spoon feeding and puree use4, 11,12. Research has also not examined in detail the choking risk 
54 
associated with type of food given, particularly in relation to considering type of puree offered (e.g. 
55 
smooth versus lumpy items).  
56 
 
57 
The aim of the current study was therefore to compare in a larger, quantitative sample episodes of 
58 
choking between infants being introduced to solid foods via baby-led or traditional methods and to 
59 
explore factors related to any choking episodes.  
60 
2. Methodology 
61 
2.1. Participants 
62 
Mothers with an infant who had been introduced to solid foods up to 12 months old completed a 
63 
questionnaire examining their method and experiences of introducing solid foods. Exclusion criteria 
64 
  
 
3 
included maternal inability to consent and significant infant health issues relating that might be 
65 
related diet or physical development such as severe reflux, downs syndrome or failure to thrive.  
66 
 
67 
Mothers were predominantly recruited using online methods, using social media and parenting 
68 
forums to advertise the survey (e.g. mumsnet.com and Facebook parenting groups). Permission was 
69 
gained from the hosts of these boards to advertise and then a study advert explaining the research 
70 
and inclusion criteria was placed online. The study advert contained an online link to complete the 
71 
questionnaire via survey monkey.  
72 
 
73 
Given little is know about the population incidence of baby-led weaning use, and a need to compare 
74 
groups of similar size, purposive sampling was used to recruit mothers using specific targeting of 
75 
baby-led websites e.g. www.babyledweaning.com to allow for a subsample of mothers following a 
76 
baby-led weaning approach to be reached. This was to ensure that a large enough group of mothers 
77 
following a BLW approach were reached.  However it should be noted that umbers following the 
78 
method in the sample are in no way representative of those following the method in a population 
79 
sample, as population sample estimates are not available.  
80 
2.2. Data Collection    
81 
Mothers reported demographic background and infant details (age, gender, birth weight, gestation, 
82 
any developmental issues). Questions then examined timing of introduction to any solid foods and 
83 
finger foods. Participants were given the following  definition of baby-led weaning  
84 
 
85 
‘Baby-led weaning is the process of allowing a baby to self fed rather than be spoon feed. Foods are 
86 
usually given in their whole form rather than being pureed.’ 
87 
 
88 
They were then asked whether they perceived themselves to follow it with response options ‘Yes 
89 
strictly’, ‘Yes loosely’, ‘No’ and ‘I’m not sure’. Participants also estimated a) frequency of spoon-
90 
feeding and b) puree use [Response options: 0%, 10%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 100% of the time]. This 
91 
method has been used to define those following a BLW approach in a number of previous studies2,4 
92 
and was included to cross match against participants perceived status.  
93 
 
94 
Participants were then given a definition of choking, and how it was different to gagging, and asked if 
95 
their infant had ever choked. 
96 
 
97 
‘Choking is defined as a complete blockage of the airway. A baby who is choking will make little sound 
98 
as air cannot pass through the airway. The baby will be very distressed, grab at their throat or may 
99 
turn blue. Choking will usually require a caregiver to intervene to force the food out of the airway. 
100 
Gagging is a normal reflex reaction for a baby learning to eat. Gagging happens when food moves to 
101 
the back of its mouth and the baby coughs and splutters and brings the food back into the front of 
102 
their mouth again. Gagging is usually noisy unlike choking.’ 
103 
 
104 
If infants had ever choked participants reported how many times the infant had ever choked on a) 
105 
finger foods b) smooth purees c) lumpy purees. Participants then described each choking episode 
106 
  
 
4 
including age of infant at time of choking, type of food (finger, smooth puree, lumpy puree), actual 
107 
food (e.g. apple). 
108 
 
109 
The questionnaire was piloted for usability on a small group of mothers (n = 10) and found to have no 
110 
issues.  
111 
2.3. Statistics 
112 
Data were analysed using SPSS version 20. Comparison of types of food offered (finger foods, lumpy 
113 
puree and smooth puree) were compared for the weaning groups using MANCOVA. Choking was 
114 
explored by splitting participants into their infant having ever choked/never choked and further 
115 
exploration made of number of episodes of choking overall and for food type (finger food, lumpy 
116 
puree, smooth puree) amongst those who had ever choked. For ever choked chi square was used to 
117 
compare ever choking with weaning group and partial correlations to explore degree of spoon and 
118 
puree use by ever choked / never choked group. MANCOVA were used to explore number of choking 
119 
episodes (overall, finger foods, lumpy puree, smooth puree) for the three weaning groups and partial 
120 
correlations to explore choking episodes with degree of spoon and puree use. Maternal age, 
121 
education and current employment were controlled for alongside infant age and age of introduction 
122 
to solid foods.  
123 
2.4. Ethics 
124 
Approval for this study was granted by a University Research Ethics Committee. All aspects of this 
125 
study were performed in accordance with the ethical standards set out in the 1964 Declaration of 
126 
Helsinki. Study information, including researcher details, consent and confidentiality and a debrief 
127 
were included in the questionnaire. Participants were given instruction to contact their relevant 
128 
health professional if completing the questionnaire raised any issues with regard to caring for their 
129 
baby. 
130 
3. Results 
131 
1151 mothers completed the questionnaire. Mean age was 32.25 (SD 4.82) with a range from 18 – 
132 
47. Mean number of years in education was 16.51 (SD: 2.05) with a range from 10 – 18. For further 
133 
demographic data please see table one. Mean age of infant was 37.62 (SD: 8.85) with a range from 20 
134 
– 52 weeks.  
135 
3.1. Classifying weaning approach 
136 
412 mothers classed themselves as strictly BLW, 377 loose BLW and 362 traditional. The frequency of 
137 
spoon-feeding and use of purees reflected the definition given of baby-led weaning in the survey (see 
138 
table 2).  
139 
 
140 
Maternal age [F (2, 1147) = 3.538, p = .029] and years in education [F (2, 1148) = 148.156, p = < .001] 
141 
differed between the weaning groups. Age and education were similar in the strict BLW and loose 
142 
BLW and both higher compared to the traditional group. No association was found between maternal 
143 
  
 
5 
occupation and weaning group but mothers currently employed full time were more likely to follow a 
144 
traditional approach with those not employed a strict BLW approach [x = 18.081, p = 001]. No 
145 
difference in current mean age of infant between weaning groups was found (see table 2). Maternal 
146 
age, education and current employment were therefore controlled for where appropriate throughout 
147 
further analyses.  
148 
3.2. Introducing solids 
149 
Timing of introduction of solids differed by weaning group [F (2, 1149) = 142.90, p = < .001]. Post hoc 
150 
bonferroni tests showed that the strict BLW group introduced solids significantly later than those 
151 
following both a loose BLW approach (p = < .001) and a traditional approach (p = < .001) with those 
152 
following a loose BLW approach introducing solids significantly later than the traditional group (p = < 
153 
.001). For introduction to finger foods, no significant difference was found between the weaning 
154 
groups [F (2, 1149) = .336, p = .715]. For further details of timing per weaning group please see table 
155 
2.  
156 
 
157 
3.3. Diet offered 
158 
Participants reported the typical number of times their infant ate smooth purees, lumpy purees and 
159 
finger foods in a day. Strict and loose BLW offered less lumpy [F (2, 1140) = 77.076, p = < .001] or 
160 
smooth purees [F (2, 1146) = 192.13, p = < .001] and more finger foods [F (2, 1144) = 293.077, p = < 
161 
.001] compared to the traditional group (table 3).  
162 
 
163 
4. Choking 
164 
4.1. Ever choking 
165 
155 babies had choked at least once (13.6%). A one-way ANCOVA (controlling for weaning group) 
166 
found no significant difference in age of introduction to solid foods between those who had ever 
167 
choked or not [F (2, 1148) = .051, p = .950]. Ever choking was not significantly related to infant 
168 
gender, birth weight or gestation.  
169 
 
170 
Infants who had choked were offered more portions of food a day than those who had not [F (2, 
171 
1129) = 12.61, p = < .001], specifically for lumpy foods [F (2, 1129) = 19.718, p = < .001]. Thus 
172 
frequency that overall foods and each of the types were offered was controlled for where 
173 
appropriate.  
174 
 
175 
11.9% of the strict BLW group, 15.5% of the loose BLW approach and 11.6% of the traditional group 
176 
had ever choked. Analysis of what type of foods (finger, lumpy puree, smooth puree) were choked on 
177 
was restricted to participants who ever offered that type of food (44.0% smooth puree (n = 506), 
178 
38.3% lumpy puree (n = 441) 96.2% finger food (n = 1107). 145 infants (12.4%) had ever choked on a 
179 
finger food, 10 infants (2.0%) on a smooth puree and 57 (11.0%) on a lumpy puree. No significant 
180 
  
 
6 
association was found between having ever choked on any food, on a finger food, lumpy puree or 
181 
smooth puree and weaning group (Table 4).  
182 
 
183 
A multivariate ANCOVA found no significant difference in proportion of spoon-feeding or puree use 
184 
amongst those infants who had ever choked or not overall, on finger foods or on smooth purees. A 
185 
significant difference was found in frequency of puree use and having ever choked on a lumpy puree. 
186 
Those who ate purees less frequently had higher choking episodes on lumpy purees (table 5). 
187 
 
188 
4.2. Number of choking episodes 
189 
Overall there were 341 episodes of choking; 237 on finger foods, 93 on lumpy purees and 11 on 
190 
smooth purees. The mean number of choking episodes for those who had choked was 2.15 (SD: 1.60) 
191 
[range 1-10]. Modal choking frequency was 1 (36.1%) with 94.4% of babies choking five times or less. 
192 
Mean age of all choking episodes was 6.23 (SD: 2.21) 67.5% of episodes occurring between 4 – 7 
193 
months.  
194 
 
195 
No significant association was found between age of introduction to solid food and frequency of 
196 
choking  [r = -.115, p = .153]. A significant negative association was found between maternal years in 
197 
education and episodes of choking  [r = -.275, p = < .001]. No significant difference in number of 
198 
choking episodes was seen for maternal occupation but mothers currently full time employed had 
199 
lower choking episodes than those part time or who were a stay at home mother [F (1, 154) = 11.19, 
200 
p = .001]. 
201 
 
202 
A MANCOVA found that for number of overall choking episodes, finger foods and lumpy purees, 
203 
infants following a traditional approach had significantly more choking episodes than those following 
204 
either a strict BLW or loose BLW approach. No significant difference was found between the groups 
205 
for choking on smooth puree foods (table 4).  
206 
 
207 
Partial correlations (controlling for maternal education and employment) found a significant positive 
208 
association between degree of puree use and choking episodes for all foods (r = .331, p = < .001), 
209 
finger foods (r = .241, p = .006), lumpy purees (r = .291, p = .001) and smooth purees (r = .259, p = 
210 
.003). Degree of spoon use was significantly associated with number of episodes choking on all foods 
211 
(r = .354, p = < .001), (on lumpy purees (r = .323, p = < .001) and smooth purees (r = .275, p = .001) 
212 
but not finger foods (r = .162, - = .064). The higher the degree or spoon use and puree feeding, the 
213 
greater the number of choking episodes.  
214 
4.3. Specific foods 
215 
Participants specified which foods their infant had choked on. The most common finger foods to 
216 
choke on were hard/snappable foods such as apple slices or carrot sticks (n = 19), slippery foods such 
217 
as banana, melon, avocado (n = 17), dry bread especially thick cut with spread (n = 15), food with a 
218 
skin e.g. sweet potato, blackberries (n = 12) and ‘sticky’ food e.g. granola & porridge (n = 10).   
219 
 
220 
  
 
7 
Commercial jars were frequently mentioned for lumpy purees, especially those with large vegetable 
221 
chunks (n = 14) or pasta (n = 13). Respondents also gave examples of adult meals that had been 
222 
mashed such as a roast dinner (n = 9). For smooth purees, participants primarily mentioned very 
223 
smooth commercial fruit and vegetable purees that the infant had inhaled (n = 7) or yoghurt based 
224 
purees (n = 3).  
225 
5. Discussion 
226 
This paper explored reported episodes of choking amongst babies being introduced to solid foods, 
227 
specifically comparing the baby-led weaning method of allowing infants to self feed family foods in 
228 
comparison to traditional methods of spoon-feeding of purees. Ever having choked and frequency of 
229 
choking was compared for infants following a strict BLW approach, a loose BLW approach and 
230 
traditional spoon and puree feeding. Frequency of choking on different food types (finger food, 
231 
lumpy puree and smooth puree) was compared for infants who received that type of food as the 
232 
Department of Health in the UK recommend finger foods from six months of age and some infants 
233 
who were being traditionally weaned were exposed to those foods. Likewise, some infants following 
234 
a strict BLW had a small proportion of lumpy and smooth puree foods.  
235 
 
236 
Overall, experience of one or more choking episodes was generally low in the sample (13.6%) and did 
237 
not significantly differ according to weaning group or proportion of spoon-feeding or puree use. Risk 
238 
of ever choking was therefore the same in infants following a strict BLW approach, a loose BLW 
239 
approach or a traditional spoon-feeding approach. Examining the frequency of choking amongst 
240 
those who had ever choked, a traditional approach, (higher in spoon-feeding and puree use) was 
241 
associated with a greater frequency of choking episodes, for lumpy purees and finger foods. The 
242 
greater the proportion of spoon-feeding and puree use, the higher the episodes of choking. This was 
243 
independent of how often an infant received the type of food.   
244 
 
245 
Although the findings must be taken with caution, these findings suggest that in this sample, infants 
246 
following a baby-led method are not at increased risk of choking.  The findings support previous 
247 
smaller studies5,8,9,10 suggesting baby-led weaning may not increase choking risk. In fact, given that 
248 
infants following a BLW approach have significantly more experiences with finger foods than those 
249 
following a traditional approach, it could be argued that risk of choking per food episode is lower in 
250 
those following a BLW approach. 
251 
 
252 
Before the findings are considered in detail, it should be emphasized that these findings are from a 
253 
self-selecting sample and not a population based sample. The limitations of this approach and the 
254 
caution needed in generalising these findings should be noted and are discussed further on. 
255 
However, the findings raised offer initial support to the safety of the baby-led approach, at least in a 
256 
specific context, moving one step further to understanding this approach on a population level.  
257 
 
258 
Choking is a serious hazard and around one infant a month dies in the UK from choking on food or 
259 
other items with many others needing hospital treatment13. Understanding why and how infants 
260 
choke and preventing it is therefore an important public health intervention. However, infants have 
261 
the ability to chew and swallow food from around six months, even if teeth are not present. This is 
262 
reflected in current Department of Health guidelines in the UK to offer finger foods from six 
263 
  
 
8 
months14. Even without teeth at this stage, infants can use their jaw to chew food, which is sufficient 
264 
in breaking food up. They also have the ability at this age to use their tongue to move food to the 
265 
back of their mouth to be swallowed. Moreover, the gag reflex, which stops large items being 
266 
swallowed, is persistent until about 9 months. This means that large chunks of food would be unlikely 
267 
to be swallowed15,16. Distinguishing between gagging and choking is also important. Gagging is a 
268 
normal behavior when infants are learning to eat solid food and they splutter or spit out food17.  
269 
 
270 
Why might infants who are being traditionally weaned be at greater risk of number of choking 
271 
episodes? Considering finger foods, it could be a lower exposure increases choking risk. Infants who 
272 
predominantly receive finger foods do not need to switch being solid and pureed foods meaning they 
273 
know what to ‘expect’ from a meal and how to manipulate it in their  mouths. If a finger food is a 
274 
rarer event amongst smoother foods, perhaps this increases risk of choking.  
275 
 
276 
In terms of lumpy foods, the diet of traditional infants contained more lumpy puree foods that 
277 
appear to be a potential risk. Lumpy foods may be a choking hazard for infants as they are unsure 
278 
whether it is a smoother liquid that they can swallow or something that needs chewing. Infants may 
279 
become used to smooth purees at the start of weaning and struggle with lumpier ones thinking they 
280 
can just swallow. Moreover, placing the food in the infants mouth on a spoon may bypass the gag 
281 
reflex15,-17. Indeed, for those infants who were following a BLW approach but received a small 
282 
amount of lumpy foods, choking risk was higher (although not significantly) for lumpy food items. 
283 
This rare exposure may explain why they are more likely to gag on them as they are less skilled at 
284 
manipulating them. This may also explain why infants following a loose BLW approach have more 
285 
choking episodes (but not significantly) than those who follow a strict approach? Again it could be 
286 
that these infants have less practice at eating finger foods and also needed to swap more frequently 
287 
between puree and whole food, leading to increased choking risk.  
288 
 
289 
A number of specific foods were listed as being common choking foods. These included slippery, 
290 
sticky, or foods with a skin. These foods make intuitive sense to avoid in the first stages of weaning or 
291 
to give in a less risky form. For example, giving an infant a thin slice of melon that they can suck or 
292 
chew is likely to be less of a hazard than giving melon chunks which could slip out of a hand and get 
293 
stuck in the throat. Banana and avocado were also mentioned but these are less likely to cause such a 
294 
problem as they can be squashed and removed from an airway more easily. However, again, giving a 
295 
whole banana may be more appropriate than giving chopped chunks that can block an airway.  
296 
 
297 
Interestingly, drier and stickier foods also posed a problem, likely because they may stick in the 
298 
throat. However these findings need to be taken with caution as it was unknown how often these 
299 
foods were offered e.g. was melon a choking risk 5% of the time of 50% of the time? Nevertheless 
300 
they do highlight how specific foods may pose a greater risk to infants and should potentially be given 
301 
consideration in weaning guidelines. Notably, current Department of Health guidelines in the UK 
302 
recommend banana and avocado as first finger foods, thus guidance may need to be clearer.  
303 
 
304 
However, these findings must be taken in the context of the sample who participated in the study 
305 
who may well tell us something about any outcomes of a BLW approach. Although suitable for this 
306 
initial exploration, the data was collected from a sample that has selected both to follow a BLW 
307 
approach and to participate in the research. This could of course affect wider factors that predispose 
308 
  
 
9 
an infant to choke. At present BLW is not mainstream or recognized by the Department of Health 
309 
(despite the recommendation to offer finger foods from 6 months) and therefore those who follow it 
310 
may represent a certain type of mother – infant dyad. Factors associated with both infant and 
311 
mother may determine whether a baby both follows BLW and their choking risk. 
312 
 
313 
In terms of infant characteristics, it could be that babies who have had previous feeding problems are 
314 
less likely to be baby-led weaned. Infants who have an early choking experience (or even gagging 
315 
frequently on milk) may be generally more prone to choking and more likely to be spoon-fed out of 
316 
concern that they will choke (even if they start the weaning process following BLW). However, infants 
317 
with significant health problems were excluded and although 45 infants in the sample had experience 
318 
of reflux, only 11.1% of these infants had ever choked (lower than sample mean). Further feeding 
319 
characteristics could determine whether a baby starts or continue with BLW. Infants with a difficult 
320 
temperament are more likely to have feeding difficulties18 and be weaned at an earlier age19 
321 
(meaning they are unlikely to follow BLW). Infants who are seen as ‘good eaters’ may be far easier to 
322 
baby-led-wean, whereas their fussier or more difficult peers may be spoon-fed in an attempt to 
323 
encourage them to eat. Understanding the role of infant temperament is an important step in 
324 
understanding who the method may be appropriate for. Will BLW be safe and appropriate for all? 
325 
 
326 
Maternal characteristics may also well play a role in choking risk. Mothers who follow a BLW have 
327 
been shown to have lower trait anxiety20 and feel less anxious around the likelihood of their infant 
328 
choking12. Potentially higher maternal anxiety at meal times might affect choking risk e.g. the 
329 
temptation to help the infant to self-feed, cutting food items too small or encouraging intake. Higher 
330 
maternal anxiety is associated with greater pressure to eat out of concern that the infant is not 
331 
consuming enough21. This may explain the difference between those following a strict BLW or loose 
332 
BLW approach; potentially those following a looser approach are more anxious and want to give their 
333 
infants a baby-led experience, but want the perceived safety net of giving some pureed or spooned 
334 
foods. It is also possible that more anxious mothers over interpret choking events, although a clear 
335 
definition between choking and gagging was stated in the questionnaire. 
336 
 
337 
This sample may therefore represent those who follow the ‘gold standard’ of BLW. At present we are 
338 
‘stuck’ methodologically in terms of better understanding BLW. Those who follow it have made an 
339 
active choice to do so, tend to be in contact with others who do so (through online groups) and 
340 
appear to be generally knowledgeable and well informed about the method. Outcomes for the 
341 
approach are thus likely to be more positive in part due to maternal background. However to fully 
342 
understand the method we need a more diverse, likely randomized, sample to follow the method but 
343 
cannot be sure that generalizing findings to a population sample will be safe. Will appropriate foods 
344 
be offered? What maternal education is needed to ensure this happens? Can lessons be learnt from 
345 
those ‘gold standard’ BLW mothers? Caution is needed but these findings do offer another step 
346 
towards suggesting that the approach may be safe, given the right conditions.  
347 
 
348 
Further limitations include the frequency of choking instances in the sample. Only 13% of infants had 
349 
any choking episode. Therefore exploration of frequency of choking episodes was for a smaller 
350 
sample (n = 157). It is unfortunately unclear how many babies choke on a population level for 
351 
comparisons to be made but this level is between previous studies which have explored baby-led 
352 
weaning and choking frequency in much smaller samples5,9,10.  
353 
  
 
10 
Participants were also older, more educated, and with a higher percentage of professional 
354 
occupations than average. However this is a common occurrence and limitation amongst much 
355 
health behavior research22. Previous research examining the baby-led approach has also typically 
356 
found mothers following this method are on average older and have a higher level of education4-9. 
357 
Therefore given the specific recruitment of mothers following a baby-led approach this is an expected 
358 
outcome and maternal education and current employment were controlled for throughout analyses. 
359 
Care does need to be given to generalizing outcomes to a wider audience particularly when 
360 
considering if the baby-led approach can be adopted positively and safely by the wider population 
361 
but these findings offer an initial reassurance within this population.  
362 
 
363 
It is also possible that the methods used, although suitable to this exploratory study, may lead to 
364 
bias. Mothers were asked to recall episodes up to 6 months ago. However previous studies examining 
365 
BLW5-10 and other studies use recall as a primary method in health related research for a far longer 
366 
period23, 24. Moreover, no significant association was found between recall time and reported 
367 
incidences of choking. Recall might be affected by maternal guilt or desire to portray the BLW as safe 
368 
but the proportion of mothers doing this is likely to be very small and the anonymous nature of the 
369 
online questionnaire would help to reduce this. It would be difficult to avoid in any other 
370 
methodological set up. Unless observing the mother and infant during mealtimes and waiting for a 
371 
(rare) choking occurrence, these limitations cannot be avoided.  
372 
 
373 
Recruitment also used online methods of data collection. However, given the need to target specific 
374 
baby-led communities, online methods were the most suitable method to do this. Moreover, online 
375 
data collection is now popular in health and social science research25, 26 and pregnant and new 
376 
mothers are a well-known user group of internet forums27. Use tends to be inclusive of demographic 
377 
groups28 and allows cost effective access to large, targeted samples29. However it is recognized that 
378 
membership of such forums and groups may lead to a bias towards older, more educated women 
379 
and importantly proactive participants who are educated about the method.  
380 
 
381 
Limitations aside this data offers initial support to the safety of the baby-led approach in terms of 
382 
choking risk. In this particular self selecting sample, weaning approach was unrelated to risk of ever 
383 
having choked and in fact, frequency of choking was higher amongst those following a traditional 
384 
spoon-feeding approach. The findings also raise awareness of the types of food involved in choking 
385 
episodes, confirming the higher risk of hard foods such as apple slices7 and raising awareness of 
386 
slippery or stick foods. Given the limitations of the approach these data should not be taken as 
387 
significant evidence of the BLW method’s safety. However they do suggest that further work now 
388 
needs to be done to test the findings in a more varied sample. The findings must be taken in context 
389 
to the methodology but they do offer another step towards understanding the safety of the method.   
390 
 
391 
The findings are important for those working to support mothers during the weaning period and 
392 
should be of interest to those considering the development of guidelines for the baby-led method. 
393 
They may also prove useful for those designing larger scale research into the BLW approach. Further 
394 
research is now needed to explore baby-led weaning practices and outcomes in a population based 
395 
sample.
