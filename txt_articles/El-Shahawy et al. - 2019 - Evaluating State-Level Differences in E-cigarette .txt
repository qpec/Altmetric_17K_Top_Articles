Abstract
Objective: To examine the association between state-level tobacco control measures and cur-
rent use estimates of both e-cigarettes and cigarettes, while accounting for socio-demographic 
correlates.
Methods: Using the 2012–2013 and 2013–2014 National Adult 
Tobacco Survey (NATS), we assessed 
prevalence estimates of US adults’ e-cigarette and cigarette current use. Four state groups were 
created based on the combined state-specific prevalence of both products: low cigarette/e-cigarette 
(n = 15), high cigarette/e-cigarette (n = 16), high cigarette/low e-cigarette (n = 11), and low cigarette/
high e-cigarette) (n = 9). To evaluate the implementation of state-level tobacco control measures, 
Tobacco Control Index (TCI) was calculated using the State of Tobacco Control annual reports for 
2012 and 2013. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine differences among 
the four groups on socio-demographic factors and TCI. Low cigarette/e-cigarette group was used 
as the referent group.
Results: Current use estimates of each product varied substantially by state; current e-cigarette use 
was highest in Oklahoma (10.3%) and lowest in Delaware (2.7%), and current cigarette use was high-
est in West Virginia (26.1%), and lowest in Vermont (12.6%). Compared to low cigarette/e-cigarette, 
all other US-state categories had significantly lower TCI scores (high cigarette/e-cigarette: adjusted 
Relative Risk Ratio [aRRR] = 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.60–0.61, high cigarette/low e-ciga-
rette: aRRR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.73–0.74, and low cigarette/high e-cigarette: aRRR = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.71–073).
Conclusions: Enforcing existing tobacco control measures likely interacts with e-cigarette use des-
pite being cigarette-focused. Continuing to monitor e-cigarette use is critical to establish baseline 
use and evaluate future e-cigarette specific federal and state-level tobacco regulatory actions while 
accounting for the existing tobacco control environment.
 Implications: 
This study investigates state-level current use estimates of e-cigarettes and cigarettes 
among US adults; and their association with four existing tobacco control measures. The overall 
score of these measures was negatively associated with state-level current use estimates such 
that states with low current e-cigarette and cigarette use had the highest mean overall score. 
This 
study assesses the potential relationship between existing state-level tobacco control measures 
and e-cigarette use and calls for improving the enforcement of the known-to-work tobacco control 
measures across all US states, while developing evidence-based regulations and interventions 
specific to e-cigarettes within the existing US tobacco use environment.
Introduction
Globally, comprehensive tobacco control efforts have slowed the 
epidemic of tobacco use by enforcing an array of policies and regu-
lations,1 which are the result of decades of research on the multiple 
adverse effects of tobacco use, social and behavioral characteristics 
associated with tobacco use, and assiduous implementation and 
evaluation of the impact of such policies. However, tobacco con-
trol policies and research are primarily limited to conventional cig-
arette smoking.1,2 In recent years, the use of a wide range of new 
nicotine delivery products, such as electronic cigarettes (e-ciga-
rettes), has started to thrive,3,4 threatening current tobacco control 
achievements.5,6
E-cigarettes are battery-powered devices that convert nicotine-
containing liquid into a vapor that can be inhaled.7 In the United 
States, e-cigarette use has been rapidly increasing among both smok-
ers and nonsmokers alike.8–13 Nevertheless, some studies suggest that 
e-cigarette use can cause adverse health effects,14–16 and that some 
brands of the liquid nicotine used in e-cigarettes contain toxicants 
and carcinogens similar to those found in traditional cigarettes.17–21 
On the other hand, preliminary evidence suggests that e-cigarettes 
could be beneficial for harm reduction or as a smoking cessation 
aid.9,22
The number of e-cigarette brands available in the US market 
increased from 250 to 460 within a limited period of time (May 
2012–January 2014).23,24 This rapid evolution of the e-cigarette 
market and a diverse variability between products has established 
barriers to generating the needed evidence for developing targeted 
regulations.23–26 Although, the recently issued e-cigarettes’ “deem-
ing rule” provides a platform for future federal-level regulatory 
actions,27–30 US states can enforce their local policies and regula-
tions.31,32 Of particular interest, there is an ongoing debate on how 
existing tobacco control measures and policies are interacting with 
e-cigarette use,5,33–35 especially with limited existing e-cigarette spe-
cific policies, which has been primarily limited to restricting youth 
access, as of 2014.36 Existing community-level tobacco control 
measures take the form of state-level tobacco control programs, 
and we have limited knowledge of the ways in which the existing 
tobacco control environment is interacting with e-cigarette use.35 
Moreover, our knowledge is very limited regarding the state-level 
differences of e-cigarette use patterns compared to cigarette smok-
ing. To address this gap, it would be beneficial to understand state-
level differences in use of e-cigarettes, as well as cigarettes, within 
the existing tobacco control framework. This will allow researchers 
to better track state-level differences of their use and the eventual 
impact of yet-to-be implemented national and state-level e-cigarette 
control measures.
Therefore, in order to enhance our understanding of the emerg-
ing e-cigarette epidemic in the United States, the present study used 
2012–2013 and 2013–2014 data from the National Adult Tobacco 
Survey (NATS), as well as the American Lung Association’s State of 
Tobacco Control (SOTC) report for 2012 and 2013 to assess the 
state-specific prevalence estimates of cigarettes and e-cigarette use, 
and to determine their relationship with existing state-level tobacco 
control measures, while accounting for respondents’ socio-demo-
graphic characteristics. We hypothesized that overall effective imple-
mentation of tobacco control measures at the state-level, reflecting 
higher TCI scores, will be associated with lower estimates for both 
cigarette and e-cigarette use at the state-level.
Methods
Study Population
Data from the 2012–2013 and 2013–2014 NATS were used. These 
are the first years for which questions regarding e-cigarettes were 
included. We merged the NATS data for 2012–2013 and 2013–2014 
waves to obtain the overall estimates presented in the study cover-
ing the period of 2012–2014. We matched corresponding state-
level tobacco control measures from the SOTC for years 2012 and 
2013 with the 2012–2013 and 2013–2014 waves, respectively. As 
the NATS and SOTC are publicly available, the current study was 
exempt from institutional review board approval. All 50 US states 
and the District of Columbia were included in the analyses.
Details of the NATS design and methodologies are available 
elsewhere.37,38 Briefly, NATS was designed as a stratified, national 
telephone survey of US non-institutionalized adults (aged 18 years 
and older) residing in the 50 states and the District of Columbia; 
respondents were selected by random digit dialing. The sample 
design for NATS had specific semi-proportional goals by state and 
by sample frame. The state goals of the 2012–2013 NATS targeted 
a minimum of 800 completed surveys per state: 600 landline (75%) 
and 200 cell-only (25%) from each state. The top 20 most populous 
states with goals above 800 accounted for the remaining 36 
000 sur-
veys allocated across these states in approximate proportion to their 
population.37 For the 2013–2014 NATS, each state and the overall 
sample goals included 30% cell-only households and 70% landline 
households (regardless of whether they also had a cell phone). The 
state goals of the 2013–2014 NATS wave included a minimum of 
1000 combined completed surveys per state: 700 landline (70%) and 
300 cell-only (30%). The 20 most populous states had goals above 
1000 interviews, with the remaining 44 
000 completed surveys dis-
tributed across these states in approximate proportion to their popu-
lations.38 The samples of each frame were also disproportionately 
stratified by state to ensure adequate representation of each state, 
along with higher numbers of completed surveys from states with 
larger populations. The response rates of the NATS surveys were as 
follows: 2012–2013, total 44.9% with the response rate for landline 
being 47.2% and for cellular 36.3%; and 2013–2014, total 36.1%, 
landline 47.6%, cellular, 17.1%.37,38

 The 
Tobacco Control Index
The American Lung Association’s SOTC report evaluates state to-
bacco control policies and measures by comparing them against 
targets based on the most current, recognized criteria for effective to-
bacco control. The Report includes four state-level tobacco control 
measures: smoke free air laws, cessation coverage, tobacco control 
spending, and cigarette excise tax. Two of those measures are based 
on a scoring system that includes an evaluation of their relevant 
components. Specifically, the “smoke-free air policy score” is based 
on the availability of such policies for different types of facilities (eg, 
Government and private worksite, bars, restaurants, schools), as well 
as enforcement of these policies. The “cessation coverage score” is 
based on several metrics including the availability of cessation medi-
cations, and cessation counseling for state Medicaid health program 
and state employee health plans, as well as state quitline investment 
per smoker. The other two measures are based on actual values: the 
“state-level cigarette excise tax” in US dollars, and the percentage 
of the Centers of Disease Control’s recommended “state-level fund-
ing for tobacco prevention and control programs spending”. Further 
details of the SOTC reports are available elsewhere.39 The authors 
used the aforementioned state-level tobacco control measures found 
in the SOTC to calculate the Tobacco Control Index (TCI) as an 
overall proxy indicator for evaluating the implementation of a com-
prehensive set of tobacco control measures in each state.
The authors created the TCI following standard best practice in 
calculating similar indices.40–42 First, z-scores (ie, standardized values) 
for each of the four tobacco control measures were calculated. The 
state-level z-score for each measure was then summed up to generate an 
overall standardized TCI score for each state. In order to test the robust-
ness of the TCI, the authors examined the independent correlation of 
the each of the four measures, as well as the overall TCI, with state-level 
smoking attributable death per 100 
000 population, which were also 
published in the SOTC reports. The authors found all the four meas-
ures, as well as the TCI to be significantly negatively correlated with 
state-level smoking attributable deaths. Pearson correlation coefficient 
was −0.22 (p = .038) for tobacco control spending, −0.25 (p = .011) for 
cessation coverage, −0.27 for smoke free air laws (p = .006), −0.45 for 
cigarette excise tax (p < .001), and −0.46 (p < .001) for TCI.
E-cigarette and Cigarette Use Variables
Using the NATS, respondents who answered “yes” to the question, 
“Before today, had you ever heard of electronic cigarettes or e-ciga-
rettes?” were defined as being aware of e-cigarettes. Current users of 
e-cigarettes were identified as those NATS-respondents who selected 
“everyday,” “some days,” or “rarely” in response to the question 
“Do you now smoke tobacco in an e-cigarette every day, some days, 
rarely, or not at all?”. Ever-users of e-cigarettes were those who 
answered “yes” to the question, “Have you ever smoked tobacco 
in an e-cigarette in your entire life?”. Participants were identified to 
be current cigarette smokers if they answered “yes” to the question, 
“Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life?” and 
responded with “every day,” or “some days,” to the question, “Do 
you now smoke cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all?”.
Other Variables
We included a number of socio-demographic variables in the current 
study. Gender (male and female) was included. For age, we included 
the following categories: 18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, and 
≥65. For race/ethnicity, our categories were non-Hispanic white, 
non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, Hispanic, and non-His-
panic other. Educational attainment was categorized into less than 
high school diploma, high school graduate, some college or associate 
degree, bachelor’s degree or higher. The cut-off points for annual 
household income were <$20 
000, $20 
000–$49 
999, $50 
000–
$99 
999, ≥$100 
000. Marital status was dichotomized into married/
living with a partner, and single/ divorced/ widowed/separated.
State Categories for Combined Cigarette and 
E-cigarette Current Use
We categorized states as high or low on the current use estimate for 
each product based on whether they were above or below the mean 
state estimate of 5.56% for current e-cigarette and 18.17% for cur-
rent cigarette use. Following that, we generated four US-state catego-
ries (low cigarettes/e-cigarettes, high cigarette/low e-cigarette, low 
cigarette/high e-cigarette, and high cigarette/ e-cigarette) based on 
the combined current use estimates of each product for the 50 states 
and the District of Columbia (eg, Georgia was categorized as high 
use state for cigarettes but was also categorized as low use state for 
e-cigarettes, thus it was assigned to the high cigarette/low e-cigarette 
state category).
Statistical Analyses
For this study, data from the 2012–2013 and 2013–2014 NATS 
were merged (n = 135 
425) and analyzed in 2017. Because the NATS 
is a nationally representative survey that employs a stratified, multi-
stage sampling design, statistical analyses were performed using the 
“survey” module of Stata 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to 
account for the complex sample design and responses. Each sampling 
frame’s data were weighted differently. Landline data were weighted 
by the following items: probability of selection of a respondent’s 
telephone number, nonresponse, number of landlines in the house-
hold, and number of adults in the household, while cell phone data 
were only weighted to adjust for probability of selection and nonre-
sponse. Final weights were determined using a raking method (which 
included state, age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, educational 
attainment, and phone category) to adjust for under-coverage and 
nonresponse bias.43 For GIS mapping, the ArcGIS 10.3 (ESRI, 
Redlands, CA) software was used.
The TCI score was merged into the dataset. E-cigarette aware-
ness, lifetime and current e-cigarette and cigarette use estimates 
were calculated for each state. Weighted percentages and confidence 
intervals were used for descriptive analysis. The independent asso-
ciation between the TCI and socio-demographic characteristics and 
current cigarette and e-cigarette use was assessed at the state-level 
by grouping states into four categories, as previously described. We 
conducted multinomial logistic regression with the US-state category 
of low cigarettes/e-cigarettes as the reference group and represented 
our findings using adjusted Relative Risk Ratio (aRRR). The present 
study used a significance level of α = 0.05.
Results
Among US adults surveyed between 2012 and 2014 (N = 135 
425), 
over three-quarters (85.1%, n = 114 
990) reported ever hearing 
about e-cigarettes, 16.3% (n = 16 
007) reported ever using e-ciga-
rettes at least once in their lifetime, current e-cigarette use estimate 
was 5.4% (n = 5312), and current traditional cigarette use estimate 
was 17.4% (n = 18 
134). Table 1 presents state-level estimates of

 awareness, ever use (ie, lifetime use) and current use of e-cigarettes, 
as well as current use of traditional cigarettes among US adults. 
Considering awareness of e-cigarettes as the denominator (ie, those 
who have reported ever hearing about e-cigarettes), 19.1% reported 
lifetime use. One-third (33.1%) of ever e-cigarette users reported 
current e-cigarettes use either every day (19.3%, n = 1118), some 
days (29.3%, n = 1574), or rarely (51.5%, n = 2620). State- level 
estimates of e-cigarette awareness ranged from 79.1% (95% con-
fidence interval [CI]: 78.0–80.1) in California to 91.2% (95% CI: 
89.6–92.6) in Missouri. As for e-cigarette use, state-level estimates of 
lifetime use ranged from 10.3% (95% CI: 8.4–12.6) in Delaware to 
25.5% (95% CI: 22.9–28.3) in Oklahoma, and current use estimates 
ranged from 2.7% (95% CI: 1.8–4.0) in Delaware to 10.3% (95% 
CI: 8.5–12.4) in Oklahoma. Finally, state-level current cigarette use 
estimates ranged from 10.7% (95% CI: 8.8–12.9) in Utah to 26.1% 
(95% CI: 23.4–29.0) in West Virginia.
Awareness of e-cigarettes had limited variation across all US states 
(range: 79.1–91.2%). The distributions of the prevalence estimates 
of lifetime and current e-cigarette use appeared to be similar. For life-
time and current e-cigarette use, mostly western and southern states 
tended to have higher rates, while eastern states tended to have lower 
ones. Fourteen states had rates of lifetime e-cigarette use greater than 
or equal to 18%: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, 
Kentucky, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee, 
West Virginia, and Wyoming. We present the weighted percentage 
of current e-cigarette use by state in Figure 1, with darker shading 
indicating a higher prevalence of e-cigarette use. Classifications are 
based on quintiles. Twenty states had rates of current e-cigarette 
use equal or greater than 6%: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, 
Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, 
Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, 
Texas, Utah and Wyoming.
The overall TCI ranged from −7.12 to 5.63 (mean = 0.16, 
SD = ±2.35). Based on the mean values for current e-cigarette 
and cigarette use estimates, the four US state categories (Table 1) 
by overall use of both products were (1) low cigarette/e-cigarette 
(n = 15; TCI ranged from −0.80 to 4.62, mean = 0.64, SD = ±1.92); 
(2) high cigarette/e-cigarette (n = 16, TCI ranged from −7.12 to 
3.35, mean = −1.03, SD = ±2.43); (3) high cigarette/low e-cigarette 
(n = 11; TCI ranged from −4.44 to 4.96, mean = −0.48, SD = ±2.30); 
and (4) low cigarette/high e-cigarette (n = 9; TCI ranged from −3.90 
to 5.63, mean = −0.28, SD = ±2.56). Figure 2 shows the four state 
categories of cigarette and e-cigarette use.
The multinomial logistic regression model findings are presented 
in Table 2. Significant differences were observed regarding the TCI 
scores across the four groups, after adjusting for age, gender and 
marital status distribution, race/ethnicity composition, education 
and household income levels within all states. States in the high 
cigarette/e-cigarette category, as compared with low cigarette/e-ciga-
rette category, were associated with lower TCI score (aRRR = 0.61;

 95% CI = 0.60–0.61). Moreover, states in the high cigarette/low 
e-cigarette category and low cigarette/high e-cigarette category were 
associated with having lower TCI scores compared with states in the 
low cigarette/e-cigarette category (aRRR = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.73–
0.74, aRRR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.71–0.73, respectively). Several 
significant differences were observed among the sociodemographic 
characteristics across the four state categories, which are presented 
in Table 2.
Discussion
This study examines existing state-level tobacco control measures 
in the United States and their relationship with the combined cigar-
ette and e-cigarette current use prevalence estimates for each state. 
While controlling for individual-level sociodemographic factors, 
states in the high cigarette/e-cigarette use category, high cigarette/
low e-cigarette, and low cigarette/high e-cigarette categories were 
associated with having lower TCI scores as compared to states in 
the low cigarette/e-cigarette category, likely reflecting more overall 
comprehensive implementation of the tobacco control measures 
among the states in the low cigarette/e-cigarette category. However, 
the socio-demographic compositions for the US state categories 
seemed to play an important role suggesting that the overall effect of 
the included tobacco control measures on the state level prevalence 
estimates of e-cigarettes and cigarettes may vary depending on the 
sociodemographic composition within each state.
E-cigarette Awareness and State-Level Use Patterns
The estimates of current e-cigarette use from the present study 
(5.4%) were not substantially higher than the results of the National 
Health Interview Survey (2012–2013), which estimated current 
e-cigarette prevalence at 4.1%.44 Nevertheless, awareness varied 
slightly by state within the 80% to 90% range. As not all adults 
in the United States were aware of e-cigarettes, it could be argued 
that with the rapidly expanding marketing and advertising efforts of 
e-cigarette companies,10,45 more adults will become aware of e-ciga-
rettes. Subsequently, life time use prevalence, as well as current e-cig-
arettes use, could continue to grow with the expanding e-cigarette 
marketing efforts to perhaps approximate the prevalence estimates 
of e-cigarette use among those who are aware of the product (eg, life-
time use among the total US population was estimated to be 16.3%, 
vs. 19.1% when we account for e-cigarette use among those with 
e-cigarette awareness).
Despite the limited variation among states in terms of aware-
ness and lifetime use of e-cigarettes, its current use reflected a much 
larger variation across states, such that the state with the highest esti-
mate (Oklahoma) reporting current use of almost four times higher 
than the state with the lowest estimate (Delaware). Furthermore,

 comparing the overall current prevalence estimates of cigarettes and 
e-cigarettes revealed that current cigarette use ranged from being 
roughly twice that of e-cigarettes (1.7) in Utah to being five times 
that of e-cigarettes (5.3) in Delaware. These findings suggest that 
diffusion of current e-cigarette use is taking place in varying degrees 
among different states and that vaping innovation may differ by geo-
graphic or state-level determinants.46 There could be un-measured 
or un-identified factors that contributes to this wide variability in 
current e-cigarette use estimates between states. Comparative quali-
tative studies that explores state-level determinants for e-cigarette 
use could help identify some of these factors.
Interaction of Existing 
Tobacco Control Environment 
With E-cigarettes
Consistently, evidence has demonstrated that tobacco control 
measures are more effective when applied as a comprehensive set 
compared to a single tobacco control measure, in the sense that 
the whole is greater than the sum of individual policies or inter-
ventions.1,47 Echoing the importance of existing anti-smoking social 
norms in the United States, the rapid spread of e-cigarettes created 
a concern for many scholars about possible renormalization of to-
bacco use,48,49 which may encourage nonsmokers to commence 
cigarette smoking.50 Our findings show that the higher the level of 
tobacco control measures a state has, the more likely that the com-
bined current cigarette and e-cigarette use at the state-level would be 
lower. The spread of e-cigarettes offers a unique, yet unprecedented 
challenge in tobacco control research, as the products are marketed 
both to smokers as a smoking cessation device and to nonsmokers 
as a non-harmful method of indulging in a novel vaping behavior,8–13 
which could further its spread and perhaps use in the United States. 
While the e-cigarette debate is still ongoing, researchers and poli-
cymakers should continue to implement, and more importantly en-
force, the tobacco control measures that are known to work, as our 
results demonstrate that improved tobacco control climate at the 
state level is associated with lower rates of both traditional cigarette 
and e-cigarette use.
The current study results are to be interpreted with caution. The 
TCI represents an overall proxy indicator of the state-level tobacco 
control environment; it did not account for all state-level tobacco 
control interventions and did not include evaluation of e-cigarette 
specific measures. Based on our findings, how the existing tobacco 
control environment specifically interacts with e-cigarette use is dif-
ficult to ascertain. Currently, our knowledge of the state-level differ-
ences of e-cigarette use patterns is developing, let alone the impact 
of any future e-cigarette control regulations or policies. For example, 
evidence from the US e-cigarette sales data35 and from six European 
Union members suggests that e-cigarette sales are responsive to price 
changes,33,35 and that e-cigarettes could even be more price sensi-
tive than traditional cigarettes.33 This may not be applicable to the 
United States; Huang et al. (2014) found in their market analysis 
study that cigarette prices had no statistically significant relationship 
with e-cigarette sales.35 However, there were no prior attempts to 
evaluate the association of cigarette excise taxes with e-cigarette use 
as part of the overall existing tobacco control environment. Some 
researchers suggest implementing a tax on e-cigarettes to curb the 
spike of new e-cigarette adopters, without exerting a financial bar-
rier on a potentially less harmful product and vehicle for smoking 
cessation.26 Finally, e-cigarette users in the United States have differ-
ent sociodemographic characteristics from cigarette smokers; e-cig-
arette users are more likely to be young adults, with higher income 
and higher levels of education51,52; nonetheless, there are other recent 
reports which indicate that the sociodemographic characteristics 
associated with e-cigarette use could be changing.53,54 Our state-level 
findings were adjusted to the weighted sociodemographic character-
istics of the residents of each state; large-scale modifications in these 
compositions, although less likely—for example, due to economic 
growth—could potentially influence our findings. On the other hand, 
this is a strength of our approach, since state-level tobacco control 
measures could be interacting differently within each state due to its 
residents’ sociodemographic characteristics, which we accounted for 
in our analysis.
This study has a number of limitations deserving of mention. 
NATS data relied on self-report with no biochemical verification, 
thus there could be self-report and social desirability bias. Further, 
the cross-sectional nature of the study does not enable us to con-
clude that correlates of e-cigarette use are associated with the current 
observed use estimates to examine state-level trends of e-cigarette 
use. Moreover, current users of e-cigarettes might be transient and/
or dual users, which might result in over- or under-estimation of the 
actual current e-cigarette use of US adults. This also challenges our 
ability to interpret the wide variability between reported state-level 
e-cigarette and conventional cigarette current use. Not accounting 
for dual use of e-cigarette and cigarette in our assessment could 
have potentially modified the results; however, this is unlikely since 
our main outcome is comparing state categories for combined use 
estimates of both products. Future assessments that monitor use 
over time can account for the actual current use of e-cigarettes and 
ascertain the differences between exclusive and non-exclusive e-cig-
arette users, which could better inform e-cigarette sensitive policies 
and interventions. The TCI included an assessment of existing to-
bacco control measures on the state-level and does not account for 
variability of within state measures (ie, more granular county/mu-
nicipality level differences). Moreover, we only included four meas-
ures in constructing the TCI, which does not account for the whole 
array of recommended comprehensive tobacco control measures.1
Despite the forthcoming federal regulations pertaining to e-ciga-
rettes, several US states have already begun taking measures aimed at 
regulating them.36,55 Existing e-cigarette specific vape free air laws,36 
available in 12 states at the time of data collection, were not included 
in our evaluation of the state-level tobacco control environment. By 
2014, 28 states had banned sales to minors;36 however, we are not 
aware of any studies that assessed the enforcement of such laws and 
they were not likely to have impact upon our adult study popula-
tion. Further, 12 states had specific laws that restricted indoor use of 
e-cigarettes;36 whether these laws were enforced as well, is unknown.
Call for Action
There is limited state-level comparative research on other e-cigarette 
environment characteristics such as number of vape shops, varia-
tion in marketing and advertising with strong internet presence for 
e-cigarette companies, and comprehensive regulatory reports. For 
example, existing studies show a strong association between e-cig-
arette companies’ marketing efforts near school and e-cigarette use 
prevalence among youth.56 It is difficult to determine what factors 
may be contributing to the relatively marked increase in e-cigarette 
use in some states as compared to others. Comparative, yet state spe-
cific research is needed to identify such potential factors to be able 
to inform state specific interventions and policies. Monitoring e-cig-
arette use among US adults and the correlates of its diffusion is not 
only of critical importance for informing future regulatory actions

 and behavioral interventions, but can also provide the baseline for 
assessing the impact of federal and state-level tobacco regulatory 
actions and effectiveness of future tobacco control programs. Most 
importantly, while it may take more time to create e-cigarette specific 
laws and regulations given their controversy, our study suggests that 
the tobacco control research community should continue to advo-
cate for improved implementation of known-to-work comprehen-
sive tobacco control measures that account for cigarette taxation, 
smoke free air, cessation services coverage and funding tobacco use 
prevention and cessation interventions at the state-level. In so doing, 
this could potentially contribute to a decline in state-level cigarette 
and e-cigarette current use.
