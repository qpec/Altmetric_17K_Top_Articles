Abstract
Background and objectives Outcomes of older patients with ESRD undergoing RRT or conservative management
(CM) are uncertain. Adequate survival data, specifically of older patients, are needed for proper counseling. We
compared survival of older renal patients choosing either CM or RRT.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements A retrospective survival analysis was performed of a single-center
cohort in a nonacademic teaching hospital in The Netherlands from 2004 to 2014. Patients with ESRD ages $70
years old at the time that they opted for CM or RRT were included. Patients with acute on chronic renal failure
needing immediate start of dialysis were excluded.
Results In total, 107 patients chose CM, and 204 chose RRT. Patients choosing CM were older (mean6SD: 8364.5
versus 7664.4 years; P,0.001). The Davies comorbidity scores did not differ significantly between both groups.
Median survival of those choosing RRT was higher than those choosing CM from time of modality choice
(median; 75th to 25th percentiles: 3.1, 1.5–6.9 versus 1.5, 0.7–3.0 years; log-rank test: P,0.001) and all other
starting points (P,0.001 in all patients). However, the survival advantage of patients choosing RRT was no
longer observed in patients ages $80 years old (median; 75th to 25th percentiles: 2.1, 1.5–3.4 versus 1.4, 0.7–3.0
years; log-rank test: P=0.08). The survival advantage was also substantially reduced in patients ages $70 years
old with Davies comorbidity scores of $3, particularly with cardiovascular comorbidity, although the RRT group
maintained its survival advantage at the 5% significance level (median; 75th to 25th percentiles: 1.8, 0.7–4.1 versus
1.0, 0.6–1.4 years; log-rank test: P=0.02).
Conclusions In this single–center observational study, there was no statistically significant survival advantage
among patients ages $80 years old choosing RRT over CM. Comorbidity was associated with a lower survival
advantage. This provides important information for decision making in older patients with ESRD. CM could
be a reasonable alternative to RRT in selected patients.

Introduction
The number of older patients with ESRD is increasing
worldwide (1–3). Contributing factors are aging of
the population, increasing prevalence of diabetes
mellitus and hypertension, and earlier recognition
and referral for ESRD (3,4). Nowadays, one half or
more of all patients on dialysis are ages $65 years old
in countries like The Netherlands (5), the United
Kingdom (2), and the United States (6).
It has been questioned whether older patients with
ESRD, who often have multiple comorbidities (4,7), are
likely to benefit from RRT. Patients with an anticipated
poor prognosis on RRT may choose to forego dialysis
and decide to be treated conservatively instead. Con-
servative management (CM) entails ongoing care with
full medical treatment, including control of fluid and
electrolyte balance and correcting anemia, and provi-
sion of appropriate palliative and end of life care.
Shared decision making has been recommended to
come to a joint decision on RRT by considering
potential benefits and harms of all treatment options
and the patient’s preferences (8). Data on outcomes,
including survival and quality of life, are needed to
foster the decision making. However, adequate sur-
vival data, specifically on older patients, are limited.
A number of studies, predominantly from the United
Kingdom, has determined survival of older patients
managed conservatively compared with RRT (9–17).
In these studies, the numbers of recruited patients are
generally small, the studies are performed in hetero-
geneous study populations, and there is significant
variability in starting points used in survival analyses
(18). We performed the first Dutch study in a large
series of older patients slowly approaching ESRD, en-
abling the use of several starting points in survival
analyses. The aims of the study were to compare

 survival in patients with ESRD ages $70 years old choos-
ing either CM or RRT and determine predictors of sur-
vival.
Materials and Methods
Patient Selection
We performed a single–center retrospective cohort study
in a nonprofit, nonacademic teaching hospital in The Neth-
erlands. Clinical databases were searched for all patients
with advanced CKD receiving nephrology care during the
last 10 years (October 31, 2004 to October 31, 2014).
Patients who had chosen either CM or RRT and were
age $70 years old at the time that they opted for CM or
RRT were included. Because the decision process usually
takes place over several weeks or even longer, inclusion
was on the basis of the recording note of the decision in the
electronic medical records. Patients with acute or acute on
chronic renal failure needing immediate start of dialysis
were excluded. The study was approved by the local re-
search ethics committee.
Decision-Making Process
Decision making on RRT was started when the eGFR fell
to ,20 ml/min per 1.73 m2. There was in-depth discussion
between patient and nephrologist, during which oral and/
or written information was given about practicalities, ben-
efits, and risks of RRT and CM. If preferred, patients got
additional counseling provided by a specialist nurse and
social worker, including a visit to the patient’s home. Pa-
tients were designated as CM if they chose to forego dial-
ysis should their kidney failure progress. Full medical
treatment and multidisciplinary care, including specialist
nurses, dieticians, and social workers, were continued for
patients on CM. Patients were designated as patients on
RRT if they made the decision to start hemodialysis (HD)
or peritoneal dialysis or decided to undergo renal trans-
plantation (censored in survival analysis at the date of
transplantation). Patients were also designated as patients
on RRT if they chose to commence dialysis but died before
initiation or dialysis had not been started yet at the end of
the study. Analyses were performed according to the orig-
inal treatment choice.
Data
Data on age, sex, primary renal diagnosis, and comor-
bidity were collected from electronic medical records on all
patients at the time of modality decision. Primary renal
diagnosis was classified according to the codes of the
European Renal Association–Dialysis and Transplantation
Association. Comorbidity was scored according to the
comorbidity score by Davies et al. (19). The Davies comor-
bidity score is based on the presence of seven comorbid
conditions: ischemic heart disease (defined as prior myo-
cardial infarction, angina pectoris, or ischemic changes on
electrocardiograph), left ventricular dysfunction (defined
as clinical evidence of pulmonary edema not caused by
errors in fluid balance), peripheral vascular disease (in-
cluding distal aortic, lower extremity, and cerebrovascular
diseases), malignancy, diabetes mellitus, systemic collagen
vascular disease, and other significant disorder (e.g.,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The score assigns
one point for each present condition and produces three
groups: no comorbidity (Davies score =0), intermediate
comorbidity (Davies score =1–2), and severe comorbidity
(Davies score $3). An additional composite variable on
cardiovascular comorbidity (CVC) was formulated and
defined as positive if one or more of the individual cardio-
vascular comorbid factors used in the Davies comorbidity
score were present (i.e., ischemic heart disease, left ventric-
ular dysfunction, and peripheral vascular disease).
We identified date and eGFR calculated with the four–
point Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula at
the time of modality choice and the times of the first
eGFRs,20, ,15, and ,10 ml/min per 1.73 m2. To deter-
mine and compare the rate of decline in eGFR, time from
the first eGFR,20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 to the first
eGFR ,15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 was calculated. The rate
of decline of eGFR was dichotomized about the mean to
designate patients as slow or rapid decliners. Date of death
was recorded for those who had died before the study end
point (i.e., November 1, 2014). This was verified in the
municipal personal records database.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics were performed on both treatment
groups. Differences between the two groups were tested
using the unpaired t, chi-squared, or Mann–Whitney U test
as appropriate. Survival analysis was performed using the
Kaplan–Meier method, with assessment of differences us-
ing the log-rank test. Survival was calculated from differ-
ent starting points: from the time when the treatment decision
between CM and RRT was made and from the times when
eGFRs were first ,20, ,15, and ,10 ml/min per 1.73 m2.
Time of modality choice was used as the main starting
point. Cox proportional hazards regression models were
used to determine independent predictors of survival. First,
univariate analysis was performed between each single
variable and survival as a dependent variable using age,
sex, primary renal diagnosis, Davies comorbidity score,
eGFR at modality choice, and treatment modality in turn.
Second, Cox multiple regression analysis was carried
out using the statistically significant variables found in
univariate analysis. A P value ,0.05 was considered sta-
tistically significant. IBM SPSS Statistics version 22 (IBM
SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for all statistical analyses.
Results
Patients
In total, 311 patients were included:107 patients chose
CM, and 204 patients chose RRT (Figure 1). There were 12
patients who initially opted for RRT but changed to CM
and two patients who changed their decision vice versa.
The main reasons for changing to CM were deterioration
of clinical condition (n=6) and change in personal prefer-
ence (n=5). The two patients who changed to RRT did so
because of physical complaints after a sudden decline in
renal function. From the patients who chose RRT (n=204),
40% (n=82) did not actually receive RRT during the study
period, because either they died before initiation of dialy-
sis (n=31) or dialysis had not been started yet at the end of
the study (n=51). From those who started with RRT
(n=122), 79% (n=96) started on HD, and 21% started on

 peritoneal dialysis (n=26). Four patients underwent renal
transplantation, three of them after having started dialysis.
Some were referred with an eGFR,20 ml/min per 1.73 m2,
and therefore, the numbers at this starting point were
smaller (93 CM and 196 RRT). Also, several patients died
before their eGFR fell to ,15 or ,10 ml/min per 1.73 m2,
resulting in 73 patients choosing CM and 167 patients
choosing RRT at the first mentioned starting point and 33
patients choosing CM and 116 patients choosing RRT at the
second point. Over the last years, a threefold increase was

 observed in the number of patients choosing CM (five in
2005 and 16 in 2013), whereas the number of patients choos-
ing RRT increased modestly (13 in 2005 and 20 in 2013).
Demographic data are presented in Table 1. Patients
choosing CM were significantly older than those choosing
RRT (mean6SD: 82.564.5 versus 75.964.4 years; P,0.001),
and they had higher eGFRs at the time of modality choice
(mean6SD: 15.365.0 versus 13.164.3 ml/min per 1.73 m2;
P,0.001). However, both patient groups did not differ
significantly in terms of sex, primary renal diagnosis,
Davies comorbidity scores, CVC, and rate of decline in
eGFR. Ethnicity was predominantly white.
Survival Analyses
In total, 180 patients died during follow-up: 69 patients
choosing CM and 111 patients choosing RRT (P=0.09) (Fig-
ure 1). The overall median survival of patients with ESRD
ages $70 years old choosing RRT was higher compared
with patients choosing CM from all four starting points: the
time of modality choice (median, 75th to 25th percentiles:
3.1, 1.5–6.9 versus 1.5, 0.7–3.0 years; P,0.001), the time of
first eGFR,20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (4.5 versus 2.4 years;
P,0.001), the time of first eGFR,15 ml/min per 1.73 m2
(3.1 versus 1.5 years; P,0.001), and the time of first
eGFR,10 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (2.8 versus 0.5 years;
P,0.001) (Figure 2).
In patients ages $80 years old, there was no longer a
statistically significant survival advantage of choosing
RRT (median, 75th to 25th percentiles: 2.1, 1.5–3.4 versus
1.4, 0.7–3.0 years; P=0.08) (Figure 3). This was found in all
survival analyses using different starting points.
The survival advantage of the RRT group was also
substantially reduced in patients ages $70 years old with
Davies comorbidity scores of $3, corresponding with se-
vere comorbidity, although RRT maintained its advantage
at the 5% significance level (median, 75th to 25th percen-
tiles: 1.8, 0.7–4.1 versus 1.0, 0.6–1.4 years; P=0.02) (Figure
4). Similar results were found in survival analyses using
different starting points (data not shown).
The presence of CVC substantially, although not signif-
icantly, reduced the survival advantage of patients choosing
RRT over CM (without CVC: 7.3 versus 1.9 years; P,0.001;
with CVC: 2.3 versus 1.5 years; P=0.003) (Supplemental
Figure 1). Use of different starting points showed similar
results (data not shown). Only patients choosing RRT had a
significant lower median survival if CVC was present (2.3
versus 7.3 years; P,0.001) (Supplemental Figure 2). Such
survival differences were not observed within the CM
group (1.5 versus 1.9 years; P=0.66).
Considering the rate of decline in eGFR, the survival
advantage of those choosing RRT over CM was observed in
patient groups with both rapid and slow eGFR declines at

 ages $70 years old (rapid eGFR decline: 2.6 versus 1.9 years;
P=0.01; slow eGFR decline: 6.0 versus 3.4 years; P,0.001).
In univariate Cox regression analysis with survival mea-
sured from modality choice, the following variables were
identified as significant predictors of survival: age, Davies
comorbidity score, and treatment modality. No association
with survival was observed for the variables sex, eGFR at
modality choice, and primary renal diagnosis. In a multi-
variate regression model, the variables age, Davies comor-
bidity score, and treatment modality were entered. All were
independent predictors of survival (Table 2). Choice of
RRT was associated with lower mortality (0.6-fold; 95%
confidence interval, 0.42-fold to 0.92-fold). Older age and
presence of intermediate (1.9-fold; 95% confidence interval,
1.0-fold to 3.5-fold) and severe comorbidity (4.1-fold; 95%
confidence interval, 2.2-fold to 7.9-fold) were associated
with higher mortality, regardless of treatment modality.
Discussion
In this cohort study of older patients with ESRD, in-
cluding the second largest CM group reported so far, we
found that patients ages $70 years old choosing RRT had
better survival compared with patients choosing CM.
However, this survival advantage was lost in patients
ages $80 years old. We also observed a considerable neg-
ative effect of comorbidity on survival, particularly of
CVC. These results indicate that CM could be a valid treat-
ment option in selected patients.
Our findings are consistent with results from previous
studies and are a validation in a first Dutch cohort,
although comparison is hampered by use of different
starting points in survival calculation and heterogeneous
study populations. The most frequently used starting point
is the time of first eGFR,15 ml/min per 1.73 m2, indicating
entry into ESRD (9,11,13,15,17,18,20). Median survival of
patients on CM from this point ranges from 13 (9) to 28.2
months (17). We found a median survival of patients on
CM of 17.8 months. Another frequently used starting point
is the time of modality choice or dialysis assessment
(9,12,14,21,22). The reported median survival of patients
on CM ranged from 8.9 (14) to 41.3 months (21). We
found a median survival of 18.2 months in patients on
CM, which is comparable with the results in the works
by Brown et al. (9) and Wong et al. (22), which found me-
dian survival rates of 19 and 23.4 months, respectively, in
compatible patient groups regarding age and eGFR. The
wide range can be explained by the lack of a consistent
definition of the starting point and patient differences

 between studies. A definition is difficult, because the
decision-making process usually takes place over several
weeks or even longer. We defined this as the time when the
treatment modality was chosen and recorded in the elec-
tronic medical record. However, we actually found a sig-
nificant difference in eGFR at the time of decision between
the RRT and CM groups, indicating bias. The reason for
this is unclear.
Considering comparison of survival between patients on
CM and patients on RRT, Brown et al. (9) performed the
largest prospective cohort study reported so far, analyzing
survival of 122 patients choosing CM and 273 patients
choosing RRT. Brown et al. (9) observed no significant sur-
vival advantage of choosing RRT in patients ages .75
years old with two or more comorbidities, although the
number of these patients was small. We found similar re-
sults in a larger number of patients ages $70 years old but
fewer differences between both treatment groups with re-
gards to age and comorbidity. Hussain et al. (13) showed
in the largest retrospective analyses reported so far that the
survival advantage of choosing RRT was lost in patients
ages .80 years old and patients ages .70 years old with
poor performance status and substantially reduced in pa-
tients ages .70 years old with high comorbidity. Chandna
et al. (11) and Murtagh et al. (15) both found no survival
advantage of choosing RRT over CM in patients .75 years
old with high comorbidity scored with a self–designed
comorbidity score and the Davies comorbidity score, re-
spectively. The major contribution of our study is the val-
idation of these previous results, predominantly from the
United Kingdom, in a large Dutch population, confirming
that high age and comorbidity offset the survival advan-
tage of patients choosing RRT over CM; this is the case
from several different levels of disease severity.
Another factor associated with survival is CVC. Murtagh
et al. (15) also found ischemic heart disease as a predictor
of survival, with loss of the survival advantage of the RRT
group when ischemic heart disease was present. We still
observed a significant survival benefit in patients with
CVC choosing RRT, although the lower mortality among
the RRT group was less pronounced in patients without
CVC. Interestingly, we did not observe an association of
CVC with survival in the CM group. Possibly, dialysis
treatment rather than uremia itself unveils the negative
effect of CVC on survival. Eckardt et al. (23) recently
showed a high incidence of cardiovascular events in the
first weeks after HD initiation.
A limitation of our study is that adjustment for all
confounders was not possible, because of its observational
and retrospective nature. The two patient groups choosing
CM or RRT were comparable on most demographic data,
except that patients choosing CM were older. We were able
to adjust for age and comorbidity in survival analyses, but
it is likely that other confounders were missing. For
example, we did not collect data on frailty, performance
status, malnutrition, and cognitive impairment. This could
have altered the survival differences. Another concern is
the almost uniformly white population in our study,
limiting the generalizability. Also, such as in other studies,
patients with acute on chronic kidney failure needing
immediate start of RRT were excluded. Studies comparing
outcomes of this patient category are needed.
Another important consideration is that the found survival
differences are not exclusively the result of received treatment
but rather are associated with being in the group who chose
RRT or CM. For example, a major part of mortality is observed
in both groups before eGFR,10 ml/min per 1.73 m2
is reached or before dialysis has been initiated. The selec-
tion of the group could explain the survival differences
with a younger and likely fitter RRT group, although we
found equivalence in the Davies comorbidity score. Addi-
tional research with larger patient groups or probably, a
pooled analysis is needed to determine survival and directly
compare CM with RRT using start of actual treatment as
starting point. However, selection bias will be difficult to
rule out in a cohort study because of preferential selection
of patients for each pathway on the basis of the advice of
their professional team. A randomized, controlled trial
could probably solve these problems, but such a study
design raises difficult ethical and practical dilemmas. It
is clear, however, that future studies are needed to deter-
mine more precisely which patients are likely to benefit
or not benefit from RRT. In our opinion, this is a man-
datory first step before effective decision aids can be
developed.
To predict survival of patients with ESRD choosing
between CM or RRT, fluctuations in eGFR and individual
differences in eGFR decline have to be taken into account.
In our analyses, the survival advantage of the RRT group
over the CM group was observed in patient groups with
both rapid and slow eGFR declines. It would be interesting
to study this in more detail, questioning whether patients
who are rapid decliners are more likely to benefit from
RRT, to gain more insight into individual differences in
eGFR decline.
Our study provides important information for decision
making in older patients with ESRD choosing either CM or
RRT. Shared decision making has been recommended to
come to a joint decision on RRT (8). Our findings contribute
to the understanding of survival in older patients with
ESRD, which could improve counseling. CM could be a
reasonable alternative to RRT in selected patients. More
work needs to be done to determine survival and other
outcome data, like quality of life, that are needed to truly
foster decision making.
