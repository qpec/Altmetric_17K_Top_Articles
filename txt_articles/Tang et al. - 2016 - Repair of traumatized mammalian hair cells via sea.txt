Repair of traumatized mammalian hair cells via sea anemone
repair proteins

ABSTRACT
Mammalian hair cells possess only a limited ability to repair damage
after trauma. In contrast, sea anemones show a marked capability to
repair damaged hair bundles by means of secreted repair proteins
(RPs). Previously, it was found that recovery of traumatized hair cells
in blind cavefish was enhanced by anemone-derived RPs; therefore,
the ability of anemone RPs to assist recovery of damaged hair cells in
mammals was tested here. After a 1 h incubation in RP-enriched
culture media, uptake of FM1-43 by experimentally traumatized
murine cochlear hair cells was restored to levels comparable to those
exhibited by healthy controls. In addition, RP-treated explants had
significantly more normally structured hair bundles than time-
matched traumatized control explants. Collectively, these results
indicate that anemone-derived RPs assist in restoring normal function
and structure of experimentally traumatized hair cells of the mouse
cochlea.

INTRODUCTION
Hair cells are sensory cells equipped with an apical hair bundle
mechanoreceptor that transduces a signal when deflected in the
appropriate direction. The evolutionary origin of vertebrate hair
cells is debatable (Coffin et al., 2004). One possibility is that hair
cells arose in common ancestors of vertebrates and invertebrates. In
vertebrates, hair bundles consist of stereocilia, each of which
contains a core of cross-linked, actin filaments. Stereocilia are
graded in length across the hair bundle (Hudspeth, 1985). In
ascidians, sensory hair cells of the coronal organ feature hair
bundles consisting of actin-based stereocilia that are graded in
length across the hair bundle (Burighel et al., 2011).
Similarly, on tentacles of sea anemones, sensory hair bundles
consist of actin-based stereocilia (Watson et al., 1997). Signal
transduction in anemone hair bundles, like that of their counterparts
in vertebrates, is abolished by aminoglycosides (Watson et al.,
1997). Furthermore, in both vertebrate and anemone hair bundles,
pairs of stereocilia are joined together by extracellular linkages,
including ‘tip links’ that interconnect the tip of shorter stereocilia to
the side of the adjacent, taller stereocilia. Tip links consist, in part, of
cadherin-23 in both vertebrate and anemone hair bundles (Siemens
et al., 2004; Watson et al., 2008). Tip links are essential to
mechanotransduction. The structural integrity of tip links is
disrupted after overstimulating hair cells or after immersing hair
cells in calcium-depleted buffers (Pickles et al., 1987; Assad et al.,
1991; Zhao et al., 1996; Clark and Pickles, 1996).
In humans, overstimulating hair cells can result in noise-induced
hearing loss. Structural aberrations to hair cells after noise trauma
include a loss of tip links, disarrayed stereocilia, and even a
complete loss of hair bundles (Saunders et al., 1985; Pickles et al.,
1987; Clark and Pickles, 1996). In vertebrates, noise trauma can
lethally or sub-lethally damage hair cells because of structural
damage, oxidative stress and excitotoxicity (Cheng et al., 2005;
Hakuba et al., 2000; Henderson et al., 2006). Excitotoxicity
damages afferent synapses, rendering hair cells incapable of
communicating signals. Synaptopathy is a growing field of study
in which treatments are being sought to restore synapses to hair cells
after trauma (Kujawa and Liberman, 2015).
The repair of sub-lethally damaged hair cells ranges from
replacing lost tip links while restoring order to the splayed
stereocilia, to replacing the lost hair bundle. The replacement of
damaged or lost tip links is known to occur in birds and mammals
(Zhao et al., 1996; Jia et al., 2009; Indzhykulian et al., 2013) within
24 h of trauma. Hair cells in lower vertebrates and in mammalian
vestibular sensory epithelia can survive the loss of the hair bundle
and spontaneously develop a new hair bundle within a few days to a
week of trauma (Baird et al., 1996; Gale et al., 2002; Zheng et al.,
1999). Early reports indicated that damaged cochlear hair cells of
mammals can likewise regrow hair bundles (Sobkowicz et al., 1992,
1996), but more recent studies have been unable to confirm this
finding (Jia et al., 2009). Interestingly, in guinea pigs, noise-
damaged hair cells can be induced to regrow stereocilia after forced
expression of the transcription factor Atoh1 (Yang et al., 2012).
Once lost, hair cells in adult mammals are not thought to be
replaced. In contrast, in other classes of vertebrate animals, lost hair
cells are replaced by mitosis of supporting cells to form new
supporting cells and replacement hair cells (Corwin and Cotanche,
1988; Ryals and Rubel, 1988). Alternatively, new hair cells can
arise directly from transdifferentiation of supporting cells (Baird
et al., 1996). An active field of research is aimed at identifying the
means by which key genes might be activated in supporting cells (or
perhaps latent stem cells) in the mammalian cochlea so that these
cells re-enter the cell cycle and/or transdifferentiate into hair cells. A
detailed discussion of this fascinating research appears in several
recent reviews (Rubel et al., 2013; Burns and Corwin, 2013;
Oesterle, 2013).
How do hair cells in invertebrates fare after trauma? In anemones,
hair bundles are severely traumatized after a 1 h immersion in
calcium-depleted seawater (Watson et al., 1997, 1998). However,
even severely traumatized hair cells recover within 4 h, in part
because of specific, secreted proteins named ‘repair proteins’ (RPs)
(Watson et al., 1998). The RPs can be isolated and then exogenously
supplied to shorten the time course of functional recovery of

 anemone hair cells from 4 h to 8 min (Watson et al., 1998).
Similarly, exogenously supplied anemone RPs assist recovery of
traumatized lateral line hair cells in blind cavefish such that
functional recovery is shortened from 9 days to ≤1.3 h (Repass and
Watson, 2001; Berg and Watson, 2002). The present study tested
whether anemone RPs can assist damaged hair cells in mammals to
recover from trauma. The question is intriguing because the answer
may help to reveal the extent of the similarity between anemone and
vertebrate hair bundles.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue culture of the organ of Corti
All animal handling procedures were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Louisiana at
Lafayette. Organ of Corti explants were dissected from 3–5 day
old CD1 mouse pups (Charles River Laboratories, MA, USA) in
Hepes-buffered Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBHBSS; Life
Technologies, CA, USA). The organ of Corti explants were placed
on laminin-coated coverslips (Carolina Biological, NC, USA) and
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
supplemented with Hepes, 7% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
10 μg ml−1 ampicillin (Life Technologies) at 37°C and 5% CO2
(Parker et al., 2010). Explants were cultured for at least 1 h
before the experiment was initiated. Calcium-depleted HBHBSS
was prepared with 1× calcium/magnesium-free HBSS (Life
Technologies) supplemented with 10 mmol l−1 Hepes (pH 7.2)
and 8 mmol l−1 EGTA (final concentrations; Sigma-Aldrich, MO,
USA). Explants were incubated in HBHBSS (healthy controls) or
in calcium-depleted HBHBSS (traumatized controls and RP-
treated explants) for 15 min at room temperature (RT) followed by
either immediate processing or processing after a 1 h period.
During this 1 h period, RP-treated explants were incubated in
culture media (1 ml) enriched with RPs eluted from four specific
bands
purified
from
two
blue-native
PAGE
gels
(Life
Technologies) corresponding to RPs (Tang and Watson, 2015).
Healthy controls and traumatized controls were cultured in media
enriched with gel pieces eluted from protein-free blue-native
PAGE gels for 1 h.
FM1-43 uptake assay
Explants were immersed in 5 μmol l−1 FM1-43FX (freshly
prepared for each experiment) for 10 or 30 s followed by three
rinses in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Stained explants were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at RT. Fixed
explants were washed in PBS twice before imaging using
epifluorescence microscopy (model RP011-T, LOMO America,
IL, USA) using a 20× objective (Plan Achromat, NA=0.45).
Images were captured with an STL-11000M SBIG cooled CCD
camera (SBIG, CA, USA) operated using Maxim-DL software
(Diffraction Limited, ON, Canada). Three to four images were
taken step-wise around the middle turn of each explant. In each
image, the mean fluorescence intensity was measured in gray
values from a randomly chosen area that encompassed 15 outer
hair cells (OHCs) using ImageJ software (National Institutes of
Health, MD, USA). Fluorescence intensity data were averaged
across the three to four micrographs taken of each cochlear explant
such that a single mean fluorescence intensity value was obtained
for each explant. Data were analyzed using a factorial ANOVA to
determine the effect of treatment and litter (each treatment
included several litters). Fisher’s post hoc LSD tests were used
to test for significant differences (P<0.05) between treatments with
STATISTICA (StatSoft, Inc., OK, USA).
Hair bundle structure and OHC scores
Explants were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 2 h
followed by two 5 min washes in PBS. They were permeabilized
using 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and washed three times
in PBS for 5 min each before immersion in 20 μmol l−1 TRITC-
phalloidin (Sigma) for 1 h in the dark at RT. Explants were
washed three times in PBS for 5 min each and mounted in
ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Life Technologies). Specimens
were imaged with epifluorescence microscopy using a 100× oil
immersion objective (Plan Fluorite, NA=1.30, LOMO). We semi-
quantified differences in hair bundle morphology and abundance
by scoring hair bundles along a single row of OHCs along linear
transects of 50 μm. Each hair bundle was assigned a value of 1.0 if
it was V-shaped and 0.5 if it was disorganized; a value of 0.0 was
assigned if no phalloidin-stained hair bundle was apparent. Using
a blind design, an evaluator selected a region in the image having
the most well-structured hair bundles per 50 μm transect. Thus,
there was a unidirectional bias applied across the treatments to
select normally structured hair bundles. Scores were summed for
OHCs along the 50 μm transect to give a single value for each
explant. Data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA, with
Fisher’s post hoc LSD tests (P<0.05) to test for significant
differences among treatments.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Restoration of dye uptake after 1 h incubation in anemone
RP-enriched culture media
This study focused on OHCs of the cochlea. Uptake of FM1-43 into
hair cells via mechanotransduction channels is commonly used to
assess hair cell function (Gale et al., 2001). Control and
experimental explants of the murine organ of Corti were treated as
described in Materials and methods and then immersed in FM1-43
for 10 s (Fig. 1). Representative images are shown for healthy
controls (Fig. 1A), traumatized controls allowed to spontaneously
recover in culture media for 1 h (Fig. 1B) and explants that were
traumatized and then allowed to recover for 1 h in culture media
enriched with RPs (Fig. 1C). Fluorescence intensity was assayed
from digital micrographs. A factorial ANOVA confirmed the effect
of treatment (P=0.003) and littermates (P=0.004) on FM1-43
fluorescence within OHCs. If traumatized controls were tested
immediately after trauma, dye uptake was significantly less than in
time-matched, healthy controls (P=0.040; Fig. 1D), indicating that
loss of function occurred rapidly. If traumatized controls were
allowed to spontaneously recover from trauma for 1 h before they
were tested, dye uptake was again significantly less than in time-
matched healthy controls (P=0.001; Fig. 1D). Interestingly, if
traumatized explants were incubated for 1 h in RPs and then tested,
dye uptake was statistically comparable to that of time-matched,
healthy controls (P=0.966), despite having been traumatized
(Fig. 1D). As expected, the RP-treated explants had significantly
greater dye uptake than time-matched, traumatized controls
(P=0.002; Fig. 1D).
Because limiting FM1-43 exposure to 10 s imposes technical
challenges associated with rapidly moving specimens between
solutions that may inadvertently mechanically damage delicate hair
cells, experiments similar to those described above were performed,
but with 30 s periods of FM1-43 immersion. Again, traumatized
controls had significantly less dye uptake than time-matched,
healthy controls (Fig. 1E, P=0.002). Explants that were traumatized
and then incubated in RP for 1 h had uptake of dye comparable to
time-matched, healthy controls (P=0.498) and significantly greater
than in time-matched, traumatized controls (P=0.010; Fig. 1E).

Specimens were traumatized by a 15 min immersion in calcium-depleted culture media (or not, for healthy controls) and then assayed immediately (time-zero
traumatized controls, T0) or allowed to recover for 1 h in calcium-containing culture media alone (1 h traumatized controls, T1) or in the presence of anemone
RPs (RP). At this point, specimens were briefly incubated in FM1-43 to label functional hair cells. Representative images of: (A) a healthy control organ of

Restoration of normal morphology in hair bundles after 1 h
incubation in anemone RP-enriched culture media
Whereas healthy controls featured well-organized, V-shaped hair
bundles (Fig. 2A), specimens immersed in calcium-depleted media
showed somewhat disorganized hair bundles (Fig. 2B,C). However,
incubation in RPs after trauma often led to a partial recovery of
normal structure (Fig. 2D). In traumatized controls processed
immediately after trauma, the hair bundle score did not differ
significantly from that of time-matched, healthy controls (P=0.880;
Fig. 2E). Thus, the immediate effects of immersion in calcium-
depleted buffers on the structure of hair bundles were modest. In
traumatized controls allowed to spontaneously recover for 1 h after
trauma, the hair bundle score was significantly decreased relative
to that of time-matched, healthy controls (P=0.002; Fig. 2E),
suggesting that the full extent of damage requires some time after

 trauma to fully develop. In contrast, explants incubated in RPs for
1 h after trauma had a significantly higher hair bundle score than
time-matched traumatized controls (P=0.013; Fig. 2E). Thus, it
appears that RPs stabilized the damaged hair bundles and even
helped to restore order to them. How do anemone RPs assist murine
hair bundles to recover?
Homologs of RPs from sea anemones are present in the
murine proteome
Recently, several polypeptide constituents of RPs utilized by the
anemone Nematostella vectensis were identified using mass
spectrometry (Tang and Watson, 2015). Secreted proteasomes and
HSP70 chaperones were identified in the RP suite and, furthermore,
experimentally implicated in the repair of traumatized hair cells
(Tang and Watson, 2015). To determine the degree to which RPs are
evolutionarily conserved, anemone polypeptides were aligned
(BLASTp) to the Mus musculus proteome, and homologs were
identified for all 37 polypeptides identified in RP samples
(Table S1). Sixteen out of 37 anemone polypeptides yielded E
(expectation)-values of 0, and the highest E-value of all was 10−15.
Such low E-values indicate a high degree of homology between the
anemone
and
mouse
polypeptides.
Most
of
the
anemone
polypeptides were greater than 60% identical to mouse homologs
at the amino acid level.
Conclusions
The homology between anemone RP polypeptides and mouse
polypeptides can perhaps help to explain the biological activity of
exogenously supplied anemone RPs on traumatized murine OHCs.
Taken together, the results of this study are consistent with the
possibility that anemone repair proteins assist in restoring normal
structure and mechanotransduction to experimentally traumatized
murine OHCs. Such a recovery likely involves repositioning
stereocilia and replacing or reattaching linkages, including tip links.
The subcellular processes by which order is restored to the
disorganized hair bundles are undoubtedly complex. In anemone
hair bundles, trauma results in a decrease in F-actin levels in
stereocilia,followedbyarecoveryofF-actinlevelsattheconclusionof
repair (Watson and Mire, 2001). In birds, a reversible ‘softening’ of
hair bundles follows overstimulation in hair cells (Duncan and
Saunders, 2000). Variable levels of F-actin were observed in
stereocilia of mammalian cochlea after noise exposure (Avinash
et al., 1993; Hu and Henderson, 1997), raising the possibility that
depolymerization and re-polymerization of F-actin might also occur
in recovering stereocilia of noise-damaged hair cells of the inner ear.
The results of this study suggest that at least some of the subcellular
mechanisms by which damaged hair bundles are repaired were
conserved in evolution.
