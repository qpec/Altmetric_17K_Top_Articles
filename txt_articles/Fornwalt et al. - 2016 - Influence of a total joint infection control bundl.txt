Total joint infections
Quality improvement initiatives combined with pulsed xenon ultraviolet room disinfection were
implemented to reduce surgical site infections (SSIs) in patients undergoing total joint procedures. After
12 months, knee SSIs were reduced from 4 to 0 (P ¼ .03) and hip SSIs were reduced from 3 to 0 (P ¼ .15)
for a combined prevention of 7 SSIs (P ¼ .01) and a savings of $290,990.

Orthopedic surgical site infections (SSIs) from total knee or hip
procedures are associated with a 3% rate of mortality1 and an addi-
tional cost of care of $20,785.2 Although Trinity Medical Center
(www.trinitymedicalonline.com) SSI rates were already below the
national average in 2012, facility leadership introduced the multiple
interventions described below to reduce SSIs still further in 2013.
Trinity Medical Center is a 534-bed community health care
provider that employs 200 professionals to serve Birmingham,
Alabama, with inpatient, outpatient, diagnostic, surgical, and
emergency services.
Best practices for perioperative care are well documented.1 Sur-
face contamination in operating rooms can contaminate hands, in-
struments, and wounds, often through organisms becoming
airborne during surgery.3-5 Studies show that pulsed xenon ultra-
violet (PX-UV) light reduces microbial burden,6,7 so enhanced sur-
face disinfection incorporating PX-UV was additionally deployed.
Use of PX-UVis reported to havereduced hospital-acquiredinfection
rates of Clostridrium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA), and multiple drug-resistantorganisms within acute-
care settings by 57%, 53%, and 20%, respectively.8-10 We report our
experience of a change in SSI rates after combining PX-UV with
quality improvement interventions.
METHODS
Two approaches were combined to reduce total joint SSIs:
quality improvement and no-touch environment disinfection.
Quality improvement
The orthopedic wing was renovated and dedicated to total joint
procedures only. Quality interventions were unified under a theme
of promoting team spirit among both staff and patients. Stages of
patient care were described as moving a ball into the end zone in
football. Stages were preoperative classes, preoperative screening,
and decolonization for MRSA/methicillin-sensitive S aureus, 2
preoperative showers with chlorhexidine gluconate, skin cleansing
with chlorhexidine gluconate immediately before surgery, stan-
dardized perioperative order sets, and early ambulation on the day
of surgery when possible (Table 1). Stages were monitored and
quantified when possible.
No-touch environment disinfection
Operating rooms were disinfected nightly using PX-UV. The PX-
UV device (Xenex Healthcare Services, LLC, San Antonio, Tex) con-
sists of a single bulb that produces a full spectrum (200-280 nm)
ultraviolet C pulse from 505 J electrical energy.6 The device was
operated for between 5 and 10 minutes in each of multiple positions
selected to cover each operating room. Internal research demon-
strated a 65.3% reduction in bacterial load after PX-UV disinfection

 additionally disinfected using the PX-UV device. Compliance with
the PX-UV disinfection regimen was evaluated using the onboard
data log.
RESULTS
Both components of the intervention were implemented fully
by January 1, 2013. Patients before (2012) and after (2013) imple-
mentation did not differ in terms of age and MRSA score and sur-
geons and seniority of nursing staff remained constant over the
2 years. Except for the interventions introduced, antibiotic treat-
ment and wound dressings also remained constant. The average
American Society of Anesthesiologists risk score for patients un-
dergoing total-knee and total-hip procedure in 2012 and 2013 were
2.56 and 2.60, respectively.
Before full implementation, 4 SSIs were reported from 200 total-
hip procedures (rate ¼ 0.02) and 3 SSIs were reported from 191 total-
knee procedures (rate ¼ 0.0087) (Table 2); in sum, 7 infections from
544 procedures (rate ¼ 0.0129). After full implementation, no SSIs
were reported from either 191 total-hip procedures or 394 total-knee
procedures (585 procedures). Usinga rank sum test, P valueson these
changes were .033 (hips), .149 (knees), and .015 (combined).
DISCUSSION
SSIs from total-hip and total-knee procedures were effectively
eliminated following adoption of the combined interventions.
Hence, a combination of renovation, consolidation of procedures,
quality improvement, and no-touch disinfection seems to have
made a substantial improvement in patient safety.
Using reported SSI costs2 and mortality1 data, this intervention
may have prevented 7 infections, averted 1 death, and saved
$290,990 over the 12 months studied. The practices introduced in
2013 have been continued to date with 1 infection occurring in 493
procedures in from January to June 2015 (rate ¼ 0.002).
Although this was not a controlled clinical trial, retrospective
investigation of hospital records for risk factors for SSIs other than
those addressed by the interventions did not yield an obvious
confounder.
This study is unable to assess the influence on SSI rates of the
individual components of the program. This was neither the design
nor possible from the low number of events. Regardless, the overall
cost of implementing the combined interventions was less than the
estimated cost of the 7 SSIs that were prevented. Therefore,
implementation of a similar combination of interventions and
further investigations to maximize patient safety in total-joint
procedures seems a logical recommendation.
