Abstract
Background—Identification of factors that predict and protect against attempted suicide are 
critical for the development of effective suicide prevention and intervention programs.
Aims—To examine whether substance use mediates the association between demographic 
characteristics, suicide attempt history, and reports of a suicide attempt within 12-months after 
screening positive for active suicidal ideation or behavior during the index emergency department 
(ED) visit.
Method—Data were collected during the first two phases of the Emergency Department Safety 
Assessment and Follow-up Evaluation (ED-SAFE) study. Data collection included baseline 
interview; 6- and 12-month chart reviews; and 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, and 52-week telephone follow-up 
assessments. Structural equation modeling was used. All P-values were two-tailed, with P<0.05 
considered statistically significant.
Results—Among the 874 subjects, 195 (22%) reported a suicide attempt within 12-months after 
the index ED visit. Of participants reporting a suicide attempt, 59% were <40 years old, 59% 
female, and 76% non-Hispanic white. Associations between race, sex, and suicide attempt 12-

Emergency Departments
In many health systems, the emergency department (ED) plays a large role in the care of 
suicidal patients, with an average of 420,000 ED visits per year for attempted suicide or 
intentional self-injury (Ting, Sullivan, Boudreaux, Miller, & Camargo, 2012). Compared to 
the general populace, people seeking treatment in the ED tend to be younger and more likely 
to be unemployed, depend on public assistance, live alone, have unstable residence, and have 
substance abuse as a primary or secondary diagnosis (Downey, Zun, & Gonzales, 2009). 
Research in both community and clinical samples indicates that a high proportion of 
individuals who attempt suicide report alcohol and drug abuse or dependence (Borges, 
Walters, & Kessler, 2000). Despite accumulating evidence on the link between substance use 
and suicidal behavior, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Accordingly, experts have 
encouraged further examination of the association between substance use and suicide 
attempts by age, sex, race, ethnicity, or type of substance used (Neeleman & Farrell, 1997).
Many of the factors known to predispose individuals to suicide are also associated with 
substance use, such as depression, physical illness, poor family relationships, social 
isolation, unemployment, and stressful life events (Range et al., 1997). The frequency of 
suicide attempts among substance users is five times greater than the frequency among 
people who do not use substances. Approximately 50% of all suicide attempts involve 
alcohol and illegal drugs. When compared to nonusers, substance users with suicidal 
ideation have an elevated risk of first suicide attempts even in the absence of a plan (Borges, 
Walters, & Kessler, 2000). In addition, substance use in patients who have attempted suicide 
has been identified as one of the strongest predictors of eventual suicide (Hawton, Zahl, & 
Weatherall, 2003).
A recent literature review on substance use and suicide indicated that reported use of alcohol 
and cocaine, in particular, were associated with increased rates of suicide attempts 
(Vijayakumara, Kumarb, & Vijayakumara, 2011). Current alcohol use also was identified as 
a significant predictor of suicide attempts within 12-months after the index ED visit (Arias et 
al., 2015). However, some research suggests that after controlling for the confounding 
effects of socio-demographics and psychiatric disorders, the strength of association with 
suicide attempts is similar for all the types of drugs studied. Clarifying the association 
between substance use and attempted and completed suicide may aid prevention efforts for 
these patients (Britton & Conner, 2010). Improving the care of patients presenting with 
suicidal ideation or attempts may reduce morbidity and mortality from suicide attempts and 
may reduce the ED burden and related healthcare costs of repeat suicide related visits 
(Larkin, Smith, & Beautrais, 2008).

 In the current longitudinal study of ED patients presenting to the ED with suicidal ideation 
or behavior, we aimed to identify the relation between substance type used (e.g., alcohol, 
cocaine, marijuana) on having at least one suicide attempt 12-months after the index ED 
visit. We also examined whether substance use mediates the association between 
demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, race, ethnicity), a history of suicide attempts, and 
future suicide attempts in an ED population.
Method
Data were collected during the Emergency Department Safety Assessment and Follow-up 
Evaluation (ED-SAFE) study (U01 MH088278; Boudreaux, Camargo, Miller), a quasi-
experimental clinical trial that includes participation from eight emergency departments 
(EDs) across the United States (see Boudreaux et al., 2013 for full description of the study). 
The ED-SAFE consists of three phases of data collection: (1) Treatment as Usual, (2) 
Universal Screening, and (3) Universal Screening + Intervention. The current study focused 
on the first two phases, Treatment as Usual and Universal Screening, because our interest 
was on examining the factors affecting future suicide attempts under ED treatment without 
the study-related suicide intervention introduced in Phase 3. Data for these phases were 
collected from August 2010 to January 2012 (Treatment as Usual) and November 2011 to 
December 2012 (Universal Screening).
To gather baseline data, research assistants (RAs) staffed the ED 40 hours per week 
generally during the peak volume hours of 12:00 pm to 10:00 pm. Patients age ≥18 years, 
who reported thoughts of killing themselves in the past week, or had an actual, aborted, or 
interrupted suicide attempt in the past week, were invited to participate in the longitudinal 
portion of the study. Additional inclusion criteria included the ability to consent and a 
willingness to complete five telephone interview assessments. Exclusion criteria included; 
being medically or cognitively unable to participate in the assessment or advising calls, 
currently dwelling in a non-community setting, currently in state custody or pending legal 
action, no permanent residence, no reliable telephone service, insurmountable language 
barrier, or already enrolled in the ED-SAFE trial.
Variables for analysis
Demographic characteristics—A subset of demographic variables collected during the 
baseline assessment was examined including age, sex (male/female), race (non-white/white), 
and ethnicity (non-Hispanic/Hispanic).
Substance Use—Substance use is defined by the question “Over the past 12 months, have 
you used drugs other than those required for medical reasons?” (Skinner, 1982). Responses 
included: marijuana, painkillers used for non-medical purposes (e.g., Oxycontin, Percocet), 
cocaine, tranquilizers or sedatives (e.g., Xanax, Valium), hallucinogens (e.g., LSD, PCP), 
stimulants (e.g., speed, methamphetamines), ecstasy, heroin, cold or cough medicines used 
for non-medical purposes, inhalants (e.g., gasoline, glue), or other drugs not listed.
Alcohol misuse was assessed by calculating a score based on responses to “How often do 
you have a drink containing alcohol?”, “How many drinks containing alcohol do you have

 on a typical day when you are drinking?”, and “How often do you have four or more drinks 
on one occasion?” For men and women under 65 years of age, a total score of 8 or more and 
a score of 7 or more for men and women over 65 were considered indicators of harmful or 
hazardous alcohol use (Babor, Higgins-Biddle, Saunders, & Monteiro, 2001).
Suicide attempt history—History of suicide attempt was measured using data collected 
at baseline: “Any history, current or past, of suicide attempt?” (yes/no).
Outcomes—The primary outcome measure is whether a suicide attempt was reported 
during the 52-week period after the index ED visit (yes/no).
Following the index ED visit, each participant was telephoned by an interviewer from a 
centralized call center trained to use the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS; 
Posner et al., 2008) at 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, and 52-weeks for an outcome assessment. All 
interviewing staff received at least eight hours of training specific to the proposed effort with 
coaching and practice before interviews began. To ensure quality and measure productivity, 
a supervisor was present in the call center at all times. Productivity reports were reviewed 
periodically to ensure performance and study standards were being met.
Chart reviews were conducted by the site RA at 6- and 12-months. Prior to data collection, 
chart abstractors attended a training presentation conducted by the study principal 
investigator and project director via telephone. The first three chart reviews were 
independently reviewed by the site PI for accuracy. For the major predictor variables, kappas 
between the RA and the site PI were very strong, ranging from 0.96 to 1.00.
Statistical analyses
We performed descriptive statistics for the overall sample. The association between baseline 
variables (categorical) and report of a suicide attempt 12-months after the index ED visit 
(yes/no) were examined by using the Pearson chi-squared statistic for differences in 
proportions. All proportions were reported with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). All 
variables that were P≤0.10 (two-tailed) were included in the final structural equation model 
(SEM).
We tested the direct and indirect effects of demographic characteristics, history of suicide 
attempts, and substance use on the suicide attempt 12-months after the index ED visit using 
gsem command (generalized structural equation model) in STATA 13.1 (StataCorp, College 
Station, TX). SEM allows for the estimation of multiple models at the same time, providing 
a comprehensive view of the association among a set of variables (Hoyle & Smith, 1994), 
and are typically used to address mediation questions (Hayes, 2013; Preacher et al., 2007). 
Indirect effects were calculated by multiplying the parameter estimates for the direct effects 
on the pathway between the predicting and outcome variables. The total effect of a predictor 
on the outcome was calculated by summing the parameter estimates for all indirect and 
direct pathways from the predictor to the outcome (Arlinghaus et al., 2012). As the outcome 
and mediator variables were binary or categorical, the logit link was used and direct, 
indirect, and total effects are presented as Odds Ratios (OR), obtained by exponentiation of 
the regression parameters. Based on results of the unadjusted analyses, alcohol misuse,

 cocaine use, and suicide attempt history were included as mediators of the association 
between age, sex, race, ethnicity, and future reports of suicide attempts (Figure 1). A two-
tailed P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
There were 2,385 patients approached to complete eligibility interviews. Of those, 933 were 
enrolled in the study; however, 18 withdrew prior to baseline and 41 were found to be 
ineligible at baseline, resulting in 874 eligible and enrolled participants. Of the 874 
respondents, 56% are female, 74% white, and 13% Hispanic. The median age was 36 years, 
with most patients reporting active suicidal ideation at baseline (66%), 34% reporting 
alcohol misuse, and 8% reporting cocaine use (Table 1).
Several drug categories were tested using unadjusted analyses including marijuana, 
painkillers (e.g., Oxycontin), cocaine, tranquilizers (e.g., Valium), hallucinogens (e.g., LSD), 
stimulants (e.g., amphetamines), ecstasy, heroin, cold or cough medicines, inhalants (e.g., 
whippets), and other drugs not listed. Results indicated that there was a moderate association 
with cocaine use and a statistically significant association with alcohol misuse and a suicide 
attempt within 12-months after the index ED visit. There was a potential association with 
cocaine use, where those reporting cocaine use were more likely to have a suicide attempt 
12-months after the index ED visit (31%) when compared to non-cocaine users (22%, 
P=0.08). Alcohol misuse had an association with the suicide outcome, such that those 
reporting alcohol misuse were more likely to have a suicide attempt 12-months after the 
index ED visit (39%) when compared to those without alcohol misuse (21%, P=.008). In 
addition, reports of comorbid alcohol misuse and cocaine use had a significantly higher 
proportion of “yes” responses for the suicide attempt outcome (39%) compared to those 
without comorbid alcohol misuse and cocaine use (21%, P=0.008). Thus, in the SEM, the 
mediating effect of substance use was tested by adding comorbid alcohol misuse and 
cocaine use as a mediator.
A significant direct effect of comorbid alcohol misuse and cocaine use on the outcome, 
future suicide attempt, was confirmed. The indirect effect of race on future suicide attempt 
via substance abuse indicated that white adults were at a lower risk of future suicide attempt 
through lower substance use (P=0.05). History of suicide attempt was associated with a 
future suicide attempt (direct effect), but this effect was not mediated by alcohol misuse and 
cocaine use (Table 2).
SEM results indicated that older adults reported significantly higher alcohol misuse and 
cocaine use compared to younger adults. In addition, white adults reported significantly 
lower alcohol misuse and cocaine use compared to non-white adults. Women reported 
significantly lower alcohol misuse and cocaine use compared to men. An indirect effect of 
sex on suicide attempt via substance use was suggested (P=0.07), with women being at 
lower risk of a future suicide attempt through lower substance use. However, women 
reported a higher proportion of past suicide attempts, and through this pathway, were at a 
higher risk of reporting future suicide attempts. Because of these opposite indirect effects, 
the total direct effect of sex on future suicide attempts was close to the null (Figure 1).

 Discussion
The current study findings indicated that older adults reported significantly higher alcohol 
misuse and cocaine use compared to younger adults. In addition, white adults reported 
significantly lower alcohol misuse and cocaine use compared to non-white adults. Women 
reported significantly lower alcohol misuse and cocaine use compared to men. This lowered 
women’s risk of a future suicide attempt through lower substance use. However, women 
reported a higher proportion of past suicide attempts, and through this pathway, were at a 
higher risk of reporting future suicide attempts. The associations between race, sex, and 
suicide attempt 12-months after the index ED visit may be mediated by a combination of 
alcohol misuse and cocaine use.
Examining substance use alone, older and non-white patients reported more alcohol misuse 
and cocaine use than their younger and white counterparts. These trends in our ED 
population match what has been found in the general population (Briggs, Magnus, Lassiter, 
Patterson, & Smith, 2011). When we examined alcohol misuse and cocaine use as mediators 
of the association between age, sex, race, and future suicide attempts, both whites and 
women had indirect effects where fewer future suicide attempts were attributed to lower 
substance use in these groups compared to others. This suggests that substance use in these 
groups may not be a useful indicator of future suicide risk.
Further investigation into the demographic differences confirmed previous findings that 
women had more past suicide attempts which put them at greater risk of a future attempt 
(e.g., Lewinsohn, Rohde, Seeley, & Baldwin, 2001). Thus, women have a lower risk of 
future suicide attempts because they are less likely to use substances, but they also are at 
higher risk of attempts because they have higher reports of past attempts. These disparate 
findings emphasize the complex interaction of sex, substance use, and suicide attempts. 
They also suggest that women may be differentially at risk depending on whether they report 
substance use or past suicide attempts.
One unexpected finding was when examined independently, alcohol use had no significant 
association, and cocaine use had a borderline significant association. However, reporting 
both alcohol misuse and cocaine use was significantly associated with a future suicide 
attempt. This may be due to previous research indicating that concurrent use of alcohol and 
cocaine elicit an amplified high that can last three to five times longer than a high from 
cocaine use alone (Pennings, Leccese, & de Wolff, 2002). These findings suggest that 
comorbid use of alcohol and cocaine may have a differential impact on suicide outcomes 
when compared against single substance use (i.e., considering only alcohol misuse). 
Although existing research shows that multi-substance use is an important predictor of 
suicidal behavior (Borges, Walters, & Kessler, 2000), additional research is needed to 
determine whether comorbid substance use reliably predicts future suicide attempts in 
additional populations.
Suicide is a major public health concern and identification of factors that predict and protect 
against attempted suicide are critical for the development of effective suicide prevention and 
intervention programs. These findings contribute to improving research strategies for

 examining factors used to identify ED patients at risk for attempting suicide within a year 
after the index ED visit.
Limitations
One potential limitation of our study was that data were not from a randomly selected group 
of EDs. Although the EDs were selected to represent the general ED population in the 
United States, not all regions and ED types were represented which could limit the 
generalizability of our findings. That being said, the ED-SAFE population is the only large-
scale database involving adult patients who screened positive for active suicidal ideation 
and/or suicide behavior at the index ED visit. The ED-SAFE data provide a unique 
opportunity to examine a high-risk, but currently understudied, population. Another 
potential limitation is that we were focused on substance use and history of suicide attempts 
as mediators. Although these variables were targeted both due to the strong association with 
our ED population and availability in the ED-SAFE database, inclusion of additional factors, 
such as impulsivity, which was not examined for our study, may help further explain our 
study findings.
In addition, our study excluded heavy substance users. Patients presenting to the ED who 
were cognitively unable to participate, which included severe intoxication, were excluded 
from study enrollment. Those with intoxication or serious drug abuse problems were less 
likely to be enrolled because of our exclusion criteria, so the current findings cannot be 
applied to all substance users presenting to the ED. Additionally, it may be beneficial to 
collect data using toxicology screening to determine whether self-report data on drug and 
alcohol use align with actual behavior. However, the intent of the current research was not to 
target all substance users, but to identify whether substance use mediated the relationship 
between demographic factors and future suicide attempts.
Conclusion
Despite developments in treatment research and increased use of health care services among 
suicidal persons in the United States, there has been minimal change in the rate of suicide 
attempts or suicide completions over the past decade (Nock et al., 2008). Substance use 
disorders have been recognized as risk factors for suicide attempts in both clinical and 
general population studies (Oquendo et al., 2010), but there is limited research on at-risk for 
suicide adult ED populations. Our findings provide some insight into the impact of 
substance use on future suicide attempts in various socio-demographic groups. These results 
may be useful in the ED setting to facilitate the assessment of a patient’s future suicide risk.
