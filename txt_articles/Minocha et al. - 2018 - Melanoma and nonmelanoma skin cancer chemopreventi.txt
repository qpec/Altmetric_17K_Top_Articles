Summary
Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) causes DNA damage in melanocytes by producing photole-
sions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 8- 
oxo- 
7- 
hydrodeoxyguanosine. The 
production of reactive oxygen species by UVR also induces inflammatory cytokines 
that, together with the inherent immunosuppressive properties of UVR, propagate 
carcinogenesis. Nicotinamide (Vitamin B3) enhances DNA repair, modulates the in-
flammatory environment produced by UVR, and reduces UV- 
induced immunosup-
pression. As nicotinamide reduces the incidence of actinic keratoses and nonmelanoma 
skin cancers in high- 
risk individuals and enhances repair of DNA damage in melano-
cytes, it is a promising agent for the chemoprevention of melanoma in high- 
risk 
populations.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Melanoma is the fourth most common cancer in the Australian popula-
tion1 and the fifth leading cancer in males and seventh leading cancer 
in females in the United States.2 The global incidence of melanoma 
was 351 880 in 2015, with an age- 
standardized rate of 5 per 100 000 
persons.3 The incidence of melanoma continues to increase. In 2009, 
the lifetime risk of developing invasive melanoma or in situ melanoma 
in the United States was one in 58 and one in 78, respectively. In 2016, 
the lifetime risk increased to one in 54 and one in 58.4
An aging population5 and increased exposure to ultraviolet radi-
ation (UVR) over time and altered patterns of exposure are strongly 
correlated with the increase in melanoma incidence worldwide.6 Even 
low doses of UVR, well below the erythemal threshold, can cause for-
mation of dimeric photoproducts in DNA, such as cyclobutane pyrim-
idine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine- 
(6- 
4)- 
pyrimidone adducts.7 UVR 
also produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) that react with DNA, pro-
ducing oxidative photolesions such as 8- 
oxo- 
7- 
hydrodeoxyguanosine 
(8- 
oxodG). This DNA damage can result in genetic mutations if not 
effectively repaired.8
UVR blocks glycolysis and depletes cellular energy in keratino-
cytes.9 Even low doses of solar- 
simulated UV (ssUV), below the er-
ythemal threshold, induced significant ATP depletion at 4 hours.10 
As DNA repair is a highly energy- 
dependent process,11 this UV- 
induced energy depletion is thought to significantly hinder effective 
DNA repair. UVR also induces immunosuppression by diminishing 
the antigen- 
presenting capability of cells and inducing immunosup-
pressive cytokines.12-14 In animal models, UV- 
irradiated sites have 
diminished delayed- 
type hypersensitivity responses, a measure of an-
titumor immunity, which facilitates melanoma development in the re-
gion.15 In neonatal mouse models, exposure to mildly erythemal doses 
of UVR caused a gradual increase in the number of suppressor T cells 
(Tregs) and B cells. The altered immune environment observed in adult 
mice favored immune suppression and melanoma development.16 This 
suggests that UVR impacts both the number and activity of immune 
effector cells. Unrepaired DNA photolesions are an important trigger 
for UV- 
induced immune suppression,17 and enhancing DNA repair has 
been shown to reduce the immune suppressive effects of UVR.18
ROS produced by UVR stimulates the release of platelet- 
activating 
factor (PAF).19 PAF is a pro- 
inflammatory mediator that upregu-
lates prostaglandin E2 and stimulates the release of cytokines in-
cluding interleukin- 
4 and interleukin- 
10.20,21 It also triggers tumor 
neo- 
angiogenesis. Chronic inflammation has been identified as a 
pathological basis for tumor development.22 As a result, PAF receptor 
antagonists can significantly inhibit the metastatic potential of human 
melanoma cells in nude mice.23

Sun 
protection 
is 
recommended 
by 
the 
World 
Health 
Organization;24 however, the benefits for melanoma prevention are 
inconclusive.25-27 These conflicting results may stem from insufficient 
application (approximately a quarter of the recommended 2 mg/cm2) 
and reapplication of sunscreen28 and increased motivation to sun-
bathe, as long as sunscreen is applied.29 They may also result from 
an inadequate follow- 
up time, with reductions in melanoma found in 
an Australian study 10 years after sunscreen and supplemental beta- 
carotene trial cessation.30 A number of systemic chemopreventive 
agents have been proposed for melanoma, but very few have been 
assessed in clinical trials.
2 | MELANOMA CHEMOPREVENTION
Oral nonsteroidal anti- 
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been pro-
posed to have anticancer activity via cyclooxygenase 2 (COX- 
2) in-
hibition (Table 1). COX- 
2 and prostaglandin E2 have been found to 
increase as a result of UVB irradiation,31 and malignant melanomas 
have been shown to express COX- 
2101. A case- 
control study in 110 
women with confirmed malignant melanoma showed that there was 
a significant decrease in relative risk (RR) of melanoma with regu-
lar intake of NSAIDs (such as aspirin and ibuprofen) (RR=0.45, 95% 
CI=0.22- 
0.92, P<.05).32 The beneficial effects, however, must be 
weighed against the myriad of side effects caused by high- 
dose, long- 
term NSAID use. Adverse events reported after NSAID intake include 
hypertension, musculoskeletal disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, 
skin rashes, hemorrhage, and increased risk of adverse cardiovascular 
events.33
Statins have also been investigated for melanoma chemopreven-
tion. Statins can modify several processes of the cell cycle,34 such as 
inhibition of cellular growth, proliferation, and also have pro- 
apoptotic 
properties.34,35 They are also known for their inhibitory effects on an-
giogenesis36 and the adhesion and migration of cells by decreasing 
the secretion of metalloproteinases.37 Randomized controlled trials 
looking at the effects of statins in atherosclerosis and major coronary 
events showed an inverse relationship between statin consumption 
and melanoma incidence (P=.04).38,39 The primary hypothesis, how-
ever, of these studies was not to explore the association of statins with 
melanoma. In a matched case- 
control study using the general practice 
research database, statin use was studied in respect to 13 cancers. 
Seventy- 
nine cases of melanoma were reported, and there was no sig-
nificant increased nor decreased risk with statin intake.40
Vitamin A- 
derived retinoids block the promotion step in skin 
carcinogenesis,41 via the inhibition of proliferation, stimulation of 
differentiation, and induction of apoptosis,42 and have been used 
successfully to reduce the incidence of cutaneous squamous cell car-
cinomas.43 All- 
trans retinoic acid induced apoptosis in primary mela-
noma cells in vitro. Primary melanoma cells were more sensitive than 
matched metastases, suggesting that retinoids might be beneficial for 
early melanoma prevention in high- 
risk individuals.44 Oral retinoids 
have been used in a prospective cohort study in patients with meta-
static melanoma, in combination with alpha-2a-interferon, associated 
with a total response rate of 20% (95% CI=4- 
36%).45 In a phase II 
randomized controlled trial, however, retinoids alongside alpha- 
2b- 
interferon therapy were not effective in the treatment of metastatic 
melanoma and the side effects, including skin and mucosal dryness, 
hair loss, hepatotoxicity, hyperlipidemia, and teratogenicity, restricted 
patient use.46,47
Vitamin D has also been studied in its topical and oral forms for 
the chemoprevention of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer 
(NMSC). Topical application of calcitriol (the biologically active form 
of vitamin D) has photoprotective benefits for DNA repair, but not 
UV- 
induced immunosuppression.48 In the chemoprevention of mela-
noma, studies have been conflicting. In a double- 
blinded randomized 
controlled trial in postmenopausal women, women with a history of 
NMSC assigned to vitamin D supplementation had a reduced risk of 
melanoma, compared to placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% CI, 
0.21- 
0.90; P=.038).49 In a case- 
control study however, vitamin D sup-
plementation was retrospectively assessed in 165 melanoma patients 
and there was no evidence of reduced risk.50
Selenium is a trace element that has been proposed to inhibit 
tumorigenesis by protecting cells against oxidative damage, altering 
carcinogen metabolism, and regulating immune and endocrine func-
tions.51 Epidemiological studies on the relation between selenium and 
melanoma have yielded conflicting results. One has shown a signifi-
cant positive association between selenium intake and risk of cutane-
ous melanoma, while another has shown no association between the 
two.52,53 Selenium’s effects may extend to tumorigenesis in general, 
with less specificity to skin cancers.54

Epigallocatechin- 
3- 
gallate is a green tea constituent that has 
been shown to markedly reduce the production of UV- 
induced ROS 
in the skin in humans.55 It also reduces the infiltration of inflamma-
tory leukocytes that produce ROS which leads to epidermal lipid 
peroxidation.56 In vitro, epigallocatechin treatment resulted in a dose- 
dependent decrease in viability and proliferation of melanoma cell 
lines by stimulating cell cycle arrest and modulating cyclin D1, cdk2, 
and Bcl2 family proteins.57 The daily consumption of green tea has 
been associated with a decrease in the relative risk of cancer incidence 
in a large cohort of individuals in Japan;58 however, clinical trials with 
melanoma patients specifically are lacking.
3 | NICOTINAMIDE
Nicotinamide (NAM; also known as niacinamide) (Figure 1) is an amide 
form of vitamin B3 (niacin), a water- 
soluble vitamin. Biologically active 
forms of niacin include NAD+ and NADP. The oxidation and reduction 
of these co- 
enzymes is essential in cellular energy metabolism.59,60 
Inadequate NAM intake leads to pellagra, a condition defined by the 
three D’s: dermatitis (photosensitive), diarrhea, and dementia.61 NAM 
is centrally involved in a number of DNA repair mechanisms, via its 
function as a precursor for NAD+, the sole substrate of the DNA re-
pair enzyme poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP).62 Nicotinamide re-
plenishes cellular ATP after UV irradiation in human keratinocytes,10 
has been shown to enhance DNA repair in UV- 
irradiated human

skin,63 and significantly reduces UV- 
induced immunosuppression in 
humans.64 High- 
dose oral nicotinamide is increasingly being used in 
clinical practice for the prevention of NMSCs in high- 
risk, immune 
competent patients who have already had multiple skin cancers.65
Nicotinamide shows photoprotective effects against some of 
the biological mechanisms important in melanoma induction, includ-
ing DNA damage and UV- 
induced immunosuppression. Therefore, 
NAM’s photoprotective effects and its efficacy in chemoprevention of 
NMSCs suggest similar potential for efficacy in melanoma prevention.
4 | NICOTINAMIDE AND DNA REPAIR
DNA strand breaks that result from UVR lead to the consumption of 
NAD+, which results in the depletion of cellular ATP.66 There are mul-
tiple points in the processes of nucleotide excision repair and double- 
strand break repair in which ATP is an essential component.67 As a 
precursor for NAD+ (the essential coenzyme in ATP production), NAM 
has been shown to inhibit UV- 
induced ATP depletion and glycolytic 
blockade.10
NAM is the sole substrate for PARP. PARP responds to genotoxic 
stress by sensing DNA strand breaks and facilitates in the repair pro-
cess.66,68 PARP requires NAD+ as a substrate in the nucleus to pro-
duce NAM and ADP ribose polymers69 and as a result is responsible 
for much of the degradation of NAD+ following DNA damage.70 UVB 
produces DNA damage in skin cells and depletes cellular ATP through 
the over- 
activation of PARP.66,69 Excessive PARP activity is there-
fore detrimental to cells.71 In cutaneous melanoma, nuclear PARP 
content positively correlated with Clark and Breslow indices.72 At 
low concentrations, NAM contributes to cellular ATP and promotes 
DNA repair. At higher concentrations, NAM inhibits PARP- 
1 activity.73 
Concentrations of NAM previously found to inhibit PARP range from 
50 to 2.5 mmol/L in culture. At 50 μmol/L, 60% of PARP was inhibited 
and there was virtually no PARP activity at concentrations as high as 
2.5 mmol/L.10
50 μmol/L is believed to be a physiological concentration of NAM 
in human tissues and has been used for in vitro experiments (in ad-
dition to the 33 μmol/L NAM in cell culture medium).10,63,74 In vivo 
studies examining plasma concentrations of NAM showed that after 
500 mg of NAM was ingested under fasting conditions the mean blood 
NAD levels increased by 30% after 1 hour. By 90 minutes, plasma lev-
els returned to baseline, indicating that NAM was quickly and readily 
absorbed by tissues for metabolism and excretion.64 Therefore, its ac-
cumulation in cutaneous tissue is unlikely to surpass this additional 
supplementation.
NAM has been shown to enhance DNA repair after UVR. Using 
suberythemal doses of ssUV in vitro, NAM significantly increased DNA 
excision repair in human keratinocytes. NAM also enhanced the repair 
of CPDs and 8- 
oxodG, with a peak at 45 minutes after irradiation. At 
15 minutes, no reductions in the CPDs or 8oxoG were detected, il-
lustrating that NAM does not reduce the formation of photolesions.63 
NAM does, however, increase the rate at which DNA is repaired and 
the number of cells that are undergoing repair, as shown in unscheduled 
DNA synthesis studies in human keratinocytes and melanocytes.63,74
Another mechanism by which NAM enhances DNA repair is via 
its regulation of tumor suppressor genes, such as p53, and sirtuins. 
NAM activates the p53 pathway in a dose- 
dependent manner in in 
vitro studies.75 NAD+ is important in the regulation of p53 levels, pro-
moting a response to noxious stimuli and preventing tumorigenesis.76 
NAD+ in vitro and in vivo has been shown to prevent the downregula-
tion of p53 by ionizing radiation.77
Sirtuin 1 promotes cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis and pro-
tects cells against oxidative stress and DNA damage. Alterations of 
sirtuins in the skin and their overexpression have been postulated to 
be associated with the progression of skin carcinogenesis. NAM is a 
product of the Sir2 deacetylation reaction. NAM regulates sirtuin ac-
tivity and at physiological concentrations of NAM noncompetitively 
inhibits the deacetylase activity of Sir2 and sirtuin 1 both in vivo and 
in vitro.78 Potent inhibition by NAM may halt the progression to early 
carcinogenesis.60
FIGURE 1 Tryptophan from the diet 
is converted to NAD+ and nicotinamide. 
NAD+ regulates cellular metabolism, is 
important in transcriptional regulation, 
increases sirtuin activity, prevents the over- 
activation of PARP1, and acts indirectly to 
reduce the tumorigenic effects of reactive 
oxygen species. Exogenous nicotinamide 
contributes to the NAD+ pool

5 | NICOTINAMIDE AND 
IMMUNOMODULATION
Using a Mantoux test (a delayed- 
type hypersensitivity recall response 
to tuberculin), oral NAM was shown to significantly reduce immuno-
suppression in humans by low dose, suberythemal ssUV.13 Further, 
NAM was well tolerated and did not alter baseline immunity or im-
mune responses at unirradiated sites. Nicotinamide did not alter the 
erythemal (sunburn) threshold when used topically79 or orally.64 The 
immune effects of NAM are still incompletely understood and how-
ever may be attributable to its enhancement of DNA repair. Even at 
low concentrations and with intermittent use, NAM conferred im-
munological benefits in UV- 
irradiated skin (both shortwave UVB and 
longwave UVA).80
NAM has anti- 
inflammatory effects on the skin and has been used 
in the treatment of a range of skin disorders such as rosacea,81 acne,82,83 
and various bullous dermatoses.84,85 The anti- 
inflammatory effects of 
NAM are not yet fully understood; however, several studies support 
an anti- 
inflammatory role of NAM via the inhibition of PARP- 
1.86,87 
PARP- 
1 induces diverse inflammatory responses via the expression of 
pro- 
inflammatory cytokines, enzymes, and inflammation- 
promoting 
adhesion molecules.88 NAM has been reported to significantly reduce 
the synthesis of inflammatory mediators by active macrophages such 
as IL- 
6 and TNF- 
α.89 In HaCat keratinocytes, NAM modulates UVR- 
induced expression of IL- 
1β, IL- 
8, and matrix protein 1 (MP- 
1), while 
downregulating IL- 
10 overexpression.90
In the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases, NAM is likely to 
suppress neutrophil chemotaxis and subsequently to act as a steroid 
sparing agent.91 NAM was found to inhibit neutrophil recruitment in 
the pleural cavity of mice in response to carrageenan (potent inflam-
matory stimuli)- 
induced pleurisy.92 The addition of NAM may enhance 
the activity of transcriptional factors on the surface of neutrophils, in-
creasing functionality of the neutrophils while decreasing the quantity 
of nonfunctional neutrophils.93
Inflammation also increases the invasive potential of melanomas. 
In animal models, increases in neutrophilic infiltrate stimulate angio-
genesis and promote the ability of melanoma cells to metastasize, 
switching them toward a migratory phenotype.94 Inflammation in the 
forms of cytokines and chemokines, such as IL- 
1, interferon gamma, 
and granulocyte macrophage colony- 
stimulating factor, was higher 
in quickly growing cutaneous melanomas than in slowly growing 
ones.95 Melanoma cells also adhere more efficiently to IL- 
1- 
activated 
extracellular matrix (ECM).96 Therefore, inhibition of inflammation 
by NAM could also help reduce melanoma, but this remains to be 
determined.
6 | NICOTINAMIDE REDUCES 
KERATINOCYTE CANCERS: THE ONTRAC  
STUDY
The ONTRAC study (Oral Nicotinamide To Reduce Actinic Cancer) 
was a multicentre, phase III, double- 
blinded placebo- 
controlled trial 
in which 386 participants were recruited.65 The primary end point 
was the number of new, histologically confirmed NMSCs (basal and 
squamous cell carcinoma) over a 12- 
month intervention period. The 
secondary end points of premalignant actinic keratosis (AK) counts, 
adverse events, and number of new NMSCs that developed within 
6 months of ceasing study drug were also evaluated.
Immunocompetent patients, at high risk for NMSC (at least two 
histologically confirmed NMSCs in the previous 5 years) were included 
in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to 500 mg oral NAM 
twice daily or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The cohort was a predominantly 
older, male population, who had a mean of approximately 8 NMSC 
in the previous 5 years. Therefore, the population was high risk for 
developing skin cancers, and in general, they had a large number of 
medical comorbidities. The ONTRAC study excluded participants with 
a history of any invasive melanoma in the previous 5 years.
At each three- 
monthly visit, the number of new NMSCs in the 
NAM group was lower than that in the placebo group (between 18% 
and 29% relative rate reduction). The participants in the NAM group 
had an overall 23% lower incidence of NMSC compared to placebo 
(95% CI; 4- 
28, P=.02), which represented a reduction in the mean 
number of NMSCs per patient over the intervention period from 2.4 in 
the placebo group to 1.8 in the NAM group after adjustment for study 
site and number of previous skin cancers. The unadjusted relative rate 
reduction was 27% (95% CI; 5- 
44, P=.02). There was a 20% reduc-
tion in basal cell carcinomas (P=.02), 30% reduction in squamous cell 
carcinomas (P=.05), and 13% reduction in AKs (P=.001) at 12 months 
with NAM compared to placebo. This reduction in skin cancers was 
not maintained in the 6- 
month follow- 
up period in which NAM was 
discontinued. There was no significant difference in the number of re-
current (previously treated) NMSCs in the two groups. NAM was very 
well tolerated at this dose without any excess of adverse side effects 
compared to placebo. NAM was therefore effective at reducing the 
incidence of skin cancer.
7 | THE ONTRAC STUDY AND MELANOMA
The ONTRAC study did not assess the effect of NAM on the develop-
ment of melanomas. In total, six in situ and four invasive melanomas 
arose during the intervention period that were evenly distributed be-
tween the two groups and there were no significant differences be-
tween the thickness/invasiveness of these melanomas between the 
two study arms.
This result reflects the limitations of the ONTRAC study in assess-
ing the chemopreventive effect of NAM for melanoma. The recruit-
ment of patients in the ONTRAC study was not based upon their risk 
of melanoma, but rather on their risk of the primary end point (NMSC) 
and excluded patients with a history of invasive melanoma in the pre-
vious 5 years. There were thus insufficient melanomas in this group to 
assess any effect of NAM on melanoma incidence.
To assess melanoma incidence, the cohort would need to recruit 
individuals at high melanoma risk, such as those with a previous mel-
anoma, those with a genetic susceptibility to develop melanomas 
 10  |    
MINOCHA et Al.
(either via a strong family history, dysplastic nevus syndrome, or 
known genetic mutations, such as CDKN2A or CDK4).97 The study 
was also conducted over a 12- 
month period, and it is likely that a 
longer trial period, and a much larger study cohort, is necessary to 
adequately assess the incidence of melanomas, which are much less 
frequent than NMSCs. In another study, detecting melanomas in ex-
tremely high- 
risk individuals, 75 primary melanomas were detected 
in 311 patients over a median follow- 
up period of 3.5 years and max-
imum follow- 
up period of 5 years; 72% of the primary melanomas 
were diagnosed in the first 2 years, and 28% were diagnosed in the 
last 3 years of follow- 
up.97
The ONTRAC study suggests that larger, longer duration Phase 3 
chemoprevention studies are now warranted for melanoma chemo-
prevention in high- 
risk patients.
8 | NICOTINAMIDE AND MELANOMA
There are relatively few studies investigating NAM’s effects on mel-
anocytes and melanoma cells. Using unscheduled DNA synthesis, 
NAM was found to increase the rate of global nucleotide excision re-
pair in primary melanocytes that underwent UV irradiation.74 NAM 
enhanced repair of CPDs and 8oxodG in the melanocytes, compared 
to the controls. NAM also enhanced the repair of 8oxodG, induced 
by the culture conditions and normal cellular generation of ROS, in 
unirradiated cells, indicating its potential to protect against toxic ex-
posures other than UVR.
Vascular mimicry describes the ability of melanoma and other 
tumor cells to form ECM rich tubular networks that can mimic an-
giogenic networks.98 Their development in the tumor microenvi-
ronment predicts a poorer clinical outcome due to greater tumor 
aggressiveness. Itzhaki et al.99 demonstrated that NAM inhibited 
vascular mimicry activity in aggressive melanoma cell lines in vitro 
in a dose- 
dependent manner, likely due to its downregulation of VE- 
cadherin (CDH5) as well as other key molecules such as vascular en-
dothelial growth factor A, matrix metalloproteinase- 
2, tumor growth 
factor β1, and SIRT5. In the same study, primary melanoma cells 
were grown in the presence or absence of NAM. Concentrations of 
5 and 20 mmol/L NAM were used, and viability, proliferation, and 
invasion studies were conducted. NAM caused a dose- 
dependent 
increase in apoptosis and decrease in proliferation of melanoma 
cells.99 However, the study also found a dose- 
dependent increase 
in invasion of melanoma cells at these high, supra- 
physiological 
concentrations.
This is contrary to the melanoma cell migratory investigations 
conducted by Kunimoto et al.,100 who found that melanoma cells 
expressed SIRT1, localized to the lamellipodium of their cytoplasm. 
NAM effectively suppressed lamellipodium extension at the pro-
truding edge of migratory cells, induced by stimulatory proteins, 
and subsequently inhibited the migration and invasion of melanoma 
cells in vitro. NAM also significantly reduced the invasion of subcu-
taneously transplanted melanoma cells in immunocompetent mice 
(P=.02).
9 | CONCLUSION
Chemopreventive strategies for skin carcinogenesis are extremely 
important, especially in the face of aging populations and increasing 
rates of melanoma and NMSC worldwide. NAM is a promising and 
well- 
tolerated chemopreventive agent for patients at high risk of de-
veloping NMSC. The cost of NAM is approximately $10 per month if 
taken at 1 g per day as recommended. Based on current clinical evi-
dence of the use of NAM in NMSC and early in vitro studies conducted 
with melanocytes and melanoma cells, randomized placebo- 
controlled 
trials are now warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of NAM 
for melanoma prevention in high- 
risk patients.
