This study is the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the safety effect of high-visibility bicycle clothing. The
hypothesis was that the number of cyclist accidents can be reduced by increasing the visibility of the cyclists. The
study design was an RCT with 6793 volunteer cyclists – 3402 test cyclists (with a yellow jacket) and 3391 control
cyclists (without the jacket). The safety effect of the jacket was analysed by comparing the number of self-
reported accidents for the two groups. The accident rate (AR) (accidents per person month) for personal injury
accidents (PIAs) for the test group was 47% lower than that of the control group. For accidents involving cyclists
and motor vehicles, it was 55% lower. The study was non-blinded, and the number of reported single accidents
was significantly lower in the test group than in the control group. This is likely a result of a response bias, since
the bicycle jacket was not expected to affect the number of single accidents. To compensate for this bias, a
separate analysis was carried out. This analysis reduced the effect of the jacket from 47% to 38%.
1. Introduction
Cycling is regarded a healthy and environmentally friendly means of
transport (Hosking et al., 2011). However, cyclists are an exposed road
user group. In 2010, nearly 2000 cyclists were killed in traffic accidents
in the EU, corresponding to 7% of all traffic fatalities (Candappa et al.,
2012). In Denmark, the risk of cyclist accidents is significantly higher
than for other road user groups (Hansen and Jensen, 2012), and the risk
is most likely even far greater than reflected by the official Danish ac-
cident statistics. Research suggests a degree of under-reporting of bi-
cycle personal injury accidents (PIAs) in Denmark of up to 86% for
severely injured and 94% for slightly injured in the official Danish ac-
cident statistics (Janstrup et al., 2016). Similarly, de Geus et al. (2012)
and Heesch et al. (2011) found that accident rates among cyclists and
the degree of under-reporting are both high.
A review study from The Cochrane Library (Kwan and Mapstone,
2009) studied randomised controlled trials (RCT) to assess the effects of
increasing pedestrian and cyclist visibility. The study found 42 studies
comparing the visibility with and without visibility aids. These studies
showed that fluorescent materials improved drivers’ detection during
the day, while lamps, flashing lights and retroreflective materials im-
proved the detection at night. The review found no studies that mea-
sured the effect of increased visibility on the number of accidents.
Wood et al. (2013) also found that fluorescent and retroreflective
materials improved cyclists’ visibility. Tin Tin et al. (2013) shared the
same hypothesis, but could not confirm this.
Several studies have assessed the effect of conspicuity aids for cy-
clists on the accident rate (AR) (Chen and Shen, 2016; Hagel et al.,
2014; Heesch et al., 2011; Hoffmann et al., 2010; Lacherez et al., 2013;
Madsen et al., 2013; Miller, 2012; Teschke et al., 2012; Thornley et al.,
2008; Tin Tin et al., 2014, 2013; Wood et al., 2009). Most of these
studies found no significant results and were not RCT studies. Madsen
et al. (2013), however, conducted an RCT to assess the effect of running
lights for cyclists and used self-reported accidents to estimate the effect.
They found that the number of accidents decreased by 61%. In a study
of 9 years of cycling accidents in Seattle, Chen and Shen (2016) ob-
served a lower likelihood of injuries for bicyclists wearing reflective
clothing.
Herslund and Jørgensen (2003) suggested that increasing the visi-
bility of cyclists could reduce the number of ‘looked but failed to see’-
accidents between motorised vehicles and cyclists. This view was sup-
ported by a Finnish study of vehicle-bicycle accidents which concluded
that accidents occur because motorists notice the cyclist too late
(Räsänen and Summala, 1998).
82% of all Danish multiparty accidents involving cyclists occur in
daylight (The Danish Road Directorate, 2017). Thus, it is important to
find measures that can reduce the number of cyclist accidents in day-
light, for instance the use of fluorescent materials which could improve

 the detection by drivers as shown by Kwan and Mapstone (2009). The
objective of this study was to assess the potential of achieving a re-
duction in accident occurrence by increasing cyclists’ visibility using a
yellow bicycle jacket (Fig. 1). The hypothesis of this study was that the
use of high-visibility clothing on the upper body of a cyclist would
improve cyclists' visibility and consequently lead to a reduction in the
number of multiparty PIAs. Furthermore, it was hypothesised that the
safety effect would be higher in winter than in summer, and higher in
daylight and twilight than in the night time.
2. Method
2.1. Study design
The effect of the jacket was tested in an RCT with self-reporting of
accidents. This reporting method was chosen because as mentioned
above, the degree of underreporting of personal injury bicycle accidents
in Denmark is very high. Participants were randomly assigned to a test
and a control group. The test group participants agreed to the condition
of wearing the reflective bicycle jacket every time they would ride their
bicycles during the study period, i.e. for one full year. During that same
year, the control group would wear their regular bicycle garments.
2.2. Participants
Participants were recruited from across Denmark via newspapers,
direct email contact and radio and TV interviews. Furthermore, people
who had signed up could recommend others to participate, and the
former then participated in a lottery to win a prize. A detailed de-
scription of the recruitment for the study and the practical execution is
available in Hansen et al. (2014).
In total, 11,202 cyclists signed up for the study. Only cyclists who
would ride their bicycle at least three times a week in the summer and
who were at least 18 years old when signing up were recruited. 366
registrations were rejected because they failed to meet the criteria, see
Fig. 2. The cyclists were stratified on the jacket size (S-XXXL) since the
jackets were produced in advance and therefore limited in amount.
Thus, not all cyclists who signed up were selected to participate.
8042 participants were randomly assigned to the test and control
groups. Of these, 6793 participants confirmed their participation (test
group, n = 3402, control group, n = 3391). The test group participants
received the yellow bicycle jacket to wear during the study period,
while the control group used their regular bicycle garments with the
prospect of receiving a yellow bicycle jacket after the completion of the
study.
The demographic characteristics of the participants and the overall
Danish population are shown in Table 1. The mean age of the partici-
pants was 46 years, i.e. approx. 2.5 years below that of the average
Danish population. They used their bicycles almost every day both
summer and winter, and their typical destination was work/education.
Although they frequently rode their bicycles, 80% of the participant
households had at least one car, compared to only 60% of the Danish
population in general. The test and control groups shared similar
characteristics. However, the study participants in the two groups dif-
fered by one year in age and slightly in the frequency of their daily use

 of a bicycle during winter time, when the control group cycled more
frequently than the test group.
2.3. Questionnaires
2.3.1. Recruiting questionnaire
When signing up for the study, participants completed a web-based
questionnaire containing demographic information: subject character-
istics (gender, age), car ownership (yes/no), bicycle riding frequency
(intervals) and jacket size needed.
2.3.2. Accident questionnaire procedure
The project was conducted between 1 November 2012 and 31
October 2013. On the first day of each month, all participants received
an e-mail with a link to a web-based questionnaire (Lahrmann and
Madsen, 2014). In the e-mail, they were asked whether or not they had
been involved in an accident on their bicycle during the previous
month. In the case of a positive response, they were guided through a
questionnaire to fill out accident details corresponding to the details in
the Danish police records (for more information cf. Section 2.4).
2.3.3. Questionnaire about the use of the jacket
Once a month, on a random day, the test group received another
web-based questionnaire in which they were asked whether they had
worn the bicycle jacket the last time they rode their bicycle. The goal of
this questionnaire was to monitor the usage rate of the jacket.
(Lahrmann and Madsen, 2014)
2.4. Variables in the accident questionnaire
The accident questionnaire stated that a cycling accident could be
an accident in which the participant had hit another road user, i.e.
multiparty accidents, but also a single accident with no other road users
involved. Participants were also asked to report accidents in which they
were not injured. Later on, all reported accidents were reviewed by the
researchers, and only accidents in which the participant was cycling
and which occurred in Denmark on a public road were included. This
was to exclude mountain bike accidents in the forest, for instance.
Furthermore, at least one of the following criteria must be met:
• The cyclist had been in physical contact with a counterpart.
• As a consequence of the counterpart’s behaviour, the cyclist had
been toppled and/or injured. This criterion also included damage to
the cyclist’s belongings, even though no physical contact between
the road users had occurred.
• The cyclist had been toppled and/or injured during the bicycle ride
without the involvement of other road users.
In addition, the participants were asked to report several factors
regarding the accident, such as date and time of day of the accident,
accident location (e.g. intersection), accident type (e.g. rear-end colli-
sion), counterpart (e.g. bicyclist), state of the road (e.g. wet), lighting
conditions (e.g. dark), weather (e.g. snowing), any personal injury (e.g.
scratches), whether the accident was reported to the police and/or the
cyclist’s or the counterpart’s insurance company, whether the accident
had required a visit to the hospital emergency room or to a doctor.
Participants were also asked to give a prose description of the accident.
Finally, they were asked to access Google Maps (www.maps.google.
com) and to locate the accident on the map and copy the coordinates
from the accident location into the questionnaire.
2.5. Statistical analysis
The effect of the bicycle jacket was evaluated through comparisons
of ARs (accidents per person month) in the test and control groups
according to the principle of intention-to-treat (Rothman et al., 2008).
This principle compares all participants in the randomised groups, even
if some participants in the test group did not wear the jacket, and
prevents confounding bias (Rothman et al., 2008). Since ARs were es-
timated, the relevant measure of association was the accident rate ratio
(ARR), i.e. ratios of ARs in the test and control groups, which takes into
account any differences in the number of months participants are

 involved. Months during which we did not receive any emails from a
participant were subtracted from the total of 12 months per person. If a
participant requested to terminate participation, the following months
were not included for that participant. Because bicycle accidents are
relatively rare, ARRs can be interpreted as odds ratios and risk ratios,
i.e. we may speak about the odds of bicycle accidents being higher in
the control group – thus facilitating comparisons with other studies
(Hels et al., 2011; Kirkwood and Sterne, 2003). All statistical analyses
were based on counts of PIAs. The significance level was set at 0.05.
The bicycle jacket is expected to influence the number of multiparty
PIAs, whereas the number of single PIAs is not likely to be affected by
jacket wearing. Therefore, any difference between the test and control
groups indicates a potential reporting bias between the groups, which
may occur because the study is non-blinded, and the participants know
whether they belong to the test or control group. We adjusted for po-
tential report bias as suggested by Madsen et al. (2013) by correcting
the risk of multiparty PIAs in the control group, using a correction
factor equal to the estimated ARR for single PIAs as a general correc-
tional factor

with data from Tables 3 and 4.
This correctional factor was multiplied by the reported number of
PIAs in the control group, thus reducing the number of PIAs in the
control group caused by the likely underreporting of PIAs in the
treatment group (Madsen et al., 2013). The corrected ARs for the
control group were estimated in the following way:

As the ARRs are likely to be skewed, the standard errors are usually
estimated through a transformation to the logarithmic scale. The

3. Results
3.1. Jacket use
The average usage rate of the bicycle jacket or other types of
yellow/bright-coloured clothing over the year (percentage of days
wearing jacket out of all survey days) was 77% for the participants who
rode their bicycle in that particular month. However, a large variation
was seen in the usage rate during the 12 months of the study. The
highest usage rate was in the first month of the study (November) and
the lowest was in July (Table 2).
3.2. Response rate of accident questionnaires
The majority of all participants answered all twelve questionnaires.
The response rate was higher in the control group than in the test group
(test: 75.8%, control: 85.3%) (Table 3). Only a few participants dis-
continued their involvement in the study by email or telephone or by
not answering any of the questionnaires (test: 3%, control: 1.9%).
3.3. Accidents
From 1 November 2012 to 31 October 2013, the participants re-
ported 833 accidents. In the quality assurance process, 139 accidents
were excluded, resulting in a final number of accidents of 694. Of these,
274 accidents were reported by the test group, and 420 were reported
by the control group. Participants’ residences as well as accident loca-
tions were spread across the country (Fig. 3).
On the basis of the participants’ accident descriptions, it was as-
sessed whether the accidents were single or multiparty accidents.
Furthermore, the severity of the accident was assessed. A total of 302
accidents (44%) were assessed to be PIAs which were more severe than
bruising, and only these were included in the further analyses. PIAs of
the test group occurring at times when the participants were not
wearing the yellow jacket were included in the accident number ac-
cording to the principle of intention-to-treat.
In all types of PIAs, except those in which cyclists suffering acci-
dents were treated both at the hospital emergency room and by their

 own doctors, the number of multiparty PIAs was higher in the control
group than in the test group (Table 4). Single PIAs showed a similar
pattern, i.e. larger numbers of single PIAs were seen in the control
group than in the test group. In particular, the overall proportion of
single PIAs was greater for the test group (65%) than for the control
group (54%) (p = 0.06). The same pattern was found during winter
time, showing a higher proportion of single PIAs for the test group
(74%) compared to the control group (61%) (p = 0.10). In daylight, an
almost significantly higher percentage of single PIAs was seen in the
test group (58%) compared to the control group (45%) (p = 0.11).
Among respondents who reported a high jacket use, the proportion of
single PIAs was higher (72%) than among respondents with low jacket
use (59%). Finally, among those who stated that they wore the jacket
during the accident, the proportion of single PIAs was higher (69%)
compared to the proportion among those who reported that they did
not (56%). However, the two latter comparisons did not reach statis-
tical significance.
3.4. Safety effect of the bicycle jacket
Table 5 shows the safety effect of the bicycle jacket. Overall, the
bicycle jacket reduced the number of multiparty PIAs by 47% (ARR-
1.00 = 0.53–1.00 = −0.47) (Table 5). For motorised counterparts, the
safety effect was 55%. The safety effect was higher in winter (56%)
than in summer (39%), higher in daylight (51%) than for the overall
effect (47%), and higher for participants with high jacket use (60%)
than for those with low use (33%) (Table 5). When corrected for re-
sponse bias, the effects were reduced (Table 6). For instance, the effect
on multiparty PIAs was reduced from 47% to 38%.
4. Discussion
4.1. Safety effect of the bicycle jacket
This study found that the overall accident rate ratios for multiparty
PIAs were 47% lower for test cyclists than for the control group cyclists.
This effect is of the same magnitude as the effect of the permanent
running light (41%) (Madsen et al., 2013). The hypothesis was that the

 effect would be greater in daylight than in the dark, but the results
cannot confirm this hypothesis (daylight: 51%, dark: 49%) (Table 5).
The hypothesis was based on the assumption that due to the jacket’s
small areas of reflective material (Fig. 1), the jacket’s fluorescent yellow
colour would provide more protection in the daytime than in the dark.
Our findings suggest, however, that even a small amount of reflective
material on the garment appears to provide some protection. The effect
in twilight is based on only few accidents, and thus no conclusions
about the effect could be drawn.
The effect of the jacket was larger during winter than during
summer, which is in accordance with the hypothesis. This can be re-
lated to the fact that daylight is weak during winter in Denmark, due to
the country’s geographical location. Furthermore, bicycles usually do
not have their lights turned on during the day, and the cyclists therefore
easily blend into the surroundings unless they wear fluorescent clothing
to stand out. This means that higher jacket usage rate during winter is
an important factor for the large effect during winter. It should be noted
that although fluorescent clothing also increases the probability of
being seen in the summer, the usage of the jacket was lower in summer.
To this might be added that in summer more bright colours (from
clothing, green leaves, etc.) usually compete for attention. The effect of
wearing the bicycle jacket was also larger when the counterparty was a
motorised vehicle. The explanation may be that the view of drivers is
generally more limited compared to that of pedestrians and cyclists,
and that the former move at a higher speed.
In the present study, an average of 77% wore the jacket, and the risk
reduction for the individual cyclist who wears their jacket whenever
cycling is likely to be even greater than 47% as indicated by the safety
effect among participants with high jacket use (60%) (Table 5). Some
may argue that this effect seems unrealistically high. This may reflect a
weakness in the study design: the fact that it was non-blinded and the
use of self-reported accidents, which may result in response bias
(Furnham, 1986). It seems that the majority of the test group cyclists
believed that the bicycle jacket decreased their accident risk. At the end
of the study period, both the test and the control group cyclists were
asked, ‘To which degree do you believe that a bright-coloured bicycle jacket/
vest can increase your safety in traffic in general?’. 81% in the test group
and
66%
in
the
control
group
answered
very
high
or
high
(Thedchanamoorthy et al., 2014). The difference between the two
groups may be the result of positive experiences in the test group after
wearing the jacket for one year. Consequently, it is possible that the test
group reported slightly fewer PIAs than they should because they
wanted to prove the safety effect of the bicycle jacket. This source of
bias is well-known both in psychology (Nichols and Maner, 2008; Orne,
1962) and in medical research (Rothman et al., 2008).
It is likely that risk adaptation compensates for the effect of the
increased visibility, i.e. cyclists become less careful when they feel more
protected (Adams, 1985; Sagberg et al., 1997). The test group might
have adopted a more risky riding behaviour because they felt more safe
wearing the jacket (Koornstra, 2009). Another aspect of risk adaptation
is whether there are differences in car drivers' behaviour towards cy-
clists with and without visible safety equipment. A British study has
shown that overtaking motorists pass closer to bicyclists wearing a
helmet than bicyclists not wearing a helmet (Walker, 2007). If this was
also the case in this study, it may have influenced the size of the safety
effect. The effects mentioned point in different directions: the reporting
bias, if any, would result in a lower number of reported PIAs, whereas
the risk adaptation would result in a higher number of PIAs, causing the
two effects to cancel each other out. Moreover, the effects on the
number of PIAs in the test group are so large and robust that this is
unlikely to compromise the main result from the study: the yellow bi-
cycle jacket decreases the number of PIAs in the test group.
4.2. Study design and execution
Most traffic safety evaluation studies are conducted as before-after
studies, but this design does not allow for controlling for confounding
factors that may bias the estimated effect (Elvik, 1993, 1996). In this
study, an RCT was conducted, since this design in itself corrects for
confounding factors (Hauer, 1997). Randomisation assigns each parti-
cipant randomly to either the test group or the control group. This
implies that all possible confounders are distributed equally between
the two groups, and the design thus allows for the only difference be-
tween the two groups being the variable considered, in this case the
participants' multiparty bicycle PIAs. In this study, however, a large
number of participants (15.5%) did not confirm their participation after
the randomisation (Fig. 2), which may have resulted in a bias. One
effect was that the study participants in the test group were one year
older than the participants in the control group. Despite being statis-
tically significant (Table 1), it is unlikely that the small difference has
played any major role for the conclusion of the study. Furthermore,
drop-out numbers were similar in the two groups (test: 615, control:
634). Therefore, the safety effect found in this study can be assumed to
result from the bicycle jacket use rather than from other factors that
tend to influence the results in traditional before-after studies, such as
demographic characteristics and changes in behaviour, infrastructure
and general safety level over time.

 This study used self-reporting of accidents for data collection – a
method whose validity may be questioned. Lajunen and Özkan (2011)
conclude that official statistics as well as self-reporting are both subject
to systematic and random errors and are therefore to some degree
biased. They underline that the benefit of self-reporting is that even
minor incidents are reported, but also that in self-reporting respondents
may forget an accident. In our study, accidents are reported monthly,
which reduced the recall period to less than one month. None of the
studies described by Lajunen and Özkan (2011) used such a short re-
porting period.
Self-reported accidents can also be affected by effects of social de-
sirability. The agreement between self-reported accident data and other
data sources can be low (Wåhlberg, 2009, 2010; Wåhlberg et al., 2010).
Wåhlberg thus recommends the inclusion of a so-called “lie scale” to
correct the inconsistencies. Despite the risk of bias in self-reported ac-
cidents, these may be the best available data source, due to the large
underreporting of accidents in the official records which applies to bi-
cycle accidents in particular (Broughton et al., 2010; Bull and Roberts,
1973; Elvik and Mysen, 1999; Janstrup et al., 2016). Therefore, self-
reported accidents have previously been used in cycling accident stu-
dies in order to adjust for the under-reporting of accidents (de Geus
et al., 2012; Madsen et al., 2013). In this study, the participants’ re-
sponses indicate that only 5% (15/302 = 0.05) of cyclists’ PIAs were
reported to the police and that 32% (96/302 = 0.32) went to a hospital
emergency room, their doctor or both to be treated for their injuries
(Table 4). The consequence is that cycling safety issues are reflected
fully in neither police nor medical records and thus are not adequately
dealt with in road safety work.
This study as well as the study of the effect of bicycle lights (Madsen
et al., 2013) suggest a bias in the two groups’ reporting which could be
prompted by the fact that the experiment was non-blinded. Thus, test
group participants seem to under-report PIAs, whereas participants in
the control group seem to over-report PIAs. Similar effects are known
from both marketing and psychology and are often referred to as de-
mand characteristics (Nichols and Maner, 2008; Orne, 1962) or re-
sponse bias (Furnham, 1986). There seems to be a response bias in our
data which results in 96 single PIAs in the control group and only 80 in
the test group. This difference was unexpected, as the bicycle jacket is
supposed to have no effect on single PIAs. Madsen et al. (2013) sug-
gested a correction method to adjust for this bias, and this correction
method was applied in this study.
One implication of the use of self-reporting of accidents is the need
to ensure that all participants share a common understanding of the
definition of an accident and thus report only the desired types of ac-
cidents, leaving none of them out. To reduce this source of error, we
asked the participants to report all accidents they had been involved in
when cycling. The study team decided subsequently if the accident did
in fact comply with the inclusion criteria. This procedure caused the
number of accidents to be reduced by 139 from 833 to 694, and a
higher consistency
was
achieved as
regards
accidents included.
Furthermore, a high response rate is required when using self-reported
accidents in order to achieve representative results. The response rate of
the monthly accident questionnaires in this study was high; 75.8% in
the test group and 85.3% in the control group answered all 12 ques-
tionnaires (Table 3). A similar response rate (86%) was found by
Madsen et al. (2013). The missing responses may reflect months with no
accidents, but they may also suggest that some accidents were omitted
in the self-reporting. Since the rate of participants answering all ques-
tionnaires was lower in the test group, it cannot be ruled out that this
has created a bias and that the actual number of accidents was higher
than expected in the test group. With the correction based on the dif-
ference in single PIAs, this potential bias is compensated for. It should
be noted, however, that in both studies the participants were very
dedicated and probably not representative of the population in general.
It is likely that the response rate would be lower if using self-reporting
of accidents elsewhere.
A key prerequisite for obtaining a safety effect with the jacket is that
participants actually wore the jacket when cycling. In the study, the
usage was at its maximum at the start of the study in November, and
then decreased over the summer period, followed by a rise during au-
tumn (Table 2). Some decrease in usage rate was expected, since par-
ticipants in such studies tend to have the largest commitment at the
beginning of the study (Yanay and Yanay, 2008). In addition, although
the jacket was only a shell jacket, the participants expressed that it was
too warm to wear in the summer (Thedchanamoorthy et al., 2014).
However, the average usage rate of 77% seems high and can probably
be explained by the participants' commitment to the study.
Apart from the jacket use, the mileage driven is an important factor
affecting the number of accidents. It is generally expected that the
higher the mileage (i.e. exposure), the higher the accident number.
Although a recording of the mileage could provide insight into this
correlation, the study did not record the participants’ cycling mileage in
the monthly questionnaires. The decision to exclude this was taken
partly because the uncertainty related to this estimation would be too
large to provide useful information, partly as a result of the RCT design,
which split participants into two similar groups, thus reducing the in-
fluence of mileage on the safety effect recorded. If mileage is to be
recorded, devices such as bicycle computers are preferred in order to
ensure better estimates than can be obtained via self-reporting.
4.3. Reliability and validity of results
The study was conducted as an RCT with 6793 participants. The
number of participants needed in each group to obtain statistically
significant results was based on the rate of self-reported accidents
among cyclists in previous studies (Lohmann-Hansen et al., 2001;
Madsen et al., 2013) and on an estimated safety effect of the jacket. As
previously described the present study had a very high involvement
from the participants. Thus, 81% of participants responded to all 12
accident questionnaires. Therefore, the reliability of the trial is most
likely very high. The internal validity of the trial is affected by the fact
that the study is non-blinded. The number of single PIAs is lower in the
test group than in the control group, seemingly causing the study to be
affected by response bias. However, this bias was adjusted by scaling
down the effect of the ratio between the numbers of single PIAs in the
test group and the numbers of single PIAs in the control group. Al-
though we cannot document that the response bias seen in the reporting
of single PIAs also applies to multiparty PIAs, it is likely to have in-
fluenced the reported number of PIAs. If the presumed under-reporting
of multiparty PIAs was higher than that for single PIAs, the actual safety
effect is overestimated, even in the corrected analysis. In this case, the
safety effect may be lower than 47%. It seems unlikely, however, that
the under-reporting is higher for multiparty PIAs than for single PIAs.
On the other hand, if the response bias is lower for multiparty PIAs, the
estimation of the effect of the jacket as reflected by the corrected
analysis is conservative. The actual effect will then most likely lie be-
tween the corrected and uncorrected estimates, i.e. between 38% and
47%.
The average age of participants was approx. 2.5 years below that of
the Danish population in general, and their car ownership rate was
higher; 80% of the participants had at least one car in their household,
compared to 60% in the Danish population (Table 1). These figures and
the fact that the participants were volunteers who had signed up to use
a bicycle jacket which was expected to improve their road safety sug-
gests that participants were concerned about safety, potentially to a
higher degree than the population in general. But what will be the
impact of this on the effect of a bicycle jacket? The assessment is that
the effect of a bicycle jacket worn by a safety concerned cyclist with a
presumably defensive cycling style will be less than the effect on a risk-
seeking cyclist, because a risk-conscious cyclist is more likely than a
risk-seeking cyclist to give way even if the counterparty is the one to
give way. This influence of the external validity may point to a higher

215
 effect for the average cyclist, compared to the effect on the group in this
study.
The external validity of the experiment is challenged by the fact that
the effect is assumed to change if the environment changes. For in-
stance, the effect will most likely decrease if an increasing number of
cyclists start using a bright-coloured bicycle jacket because the jacket
will not attract as much attention when more cyclists use it. In this
study, the participants were spread across the country (Fig. 3), and the
likelihood of being in a group with multiple bicycle jackets is small.
This also means that the found effect represents an average of the effect
in big cities, small cities and rural areas, although some variation be-
tween these areas is expected. The external validity is also influenced
by the fact that other road users’ risk may increase when attention is
directed to cyclists with bright-coloured jackets at the expense of other
cyclists. These considerations are not specific to bright-coloured jackets
but are generally valid. Overall, the assessment of the external validity
is that the effect will most likely decrease as jacket use increases, but
not to a degree that may compromise a general positive effect of a
yellow jacket.
5. Conclusions
This randomised controlled study delivered strong evidence that
cyclists are protected against multiparty accidents when wearing a
bright-coloured jacket. Other studies have also indicated that higher
visibility of cyclists significantly reduces their number of PIAs. This
study involved as many as 6793 cyclists and estimated a statistically
significant reduction of 47% of multiparty PIAs.
