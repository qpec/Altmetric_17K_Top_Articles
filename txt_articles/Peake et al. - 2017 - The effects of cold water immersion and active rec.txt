Key points
r Cold water immersion and active recovery are common post-exercise recovery treatments. A
key assumption about the benefits of cold water immersion is that it reduces inflammation in
skeletal muscle. However, no data are available from humans to support this notion.
r We compared the effects of cold water immersion and active recovery on inflammatory and
cellular stress responses in skeletal muscle from exercise-trained men 2, 24 and 48 h during
recovery after acute resistance exercise.
r Exercise led to the infiltration of inflammatory cells, with increased mRNA expression of
pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotrophins, and the subcellular translocation of heat
shock proteins in muscle. These responses did not differ significantly between cold water
immersion and active recovery.
r Our results suggest that cold water immersion is no more effective than active recovery for
minimizing the inflammatory and stress responses in muscle after resistance exercise.
Abstract
Cold water immersion and active recovery are common post-exercise recovery
treatments. However, little is known about whether these treatments influence inflammation
and cellular stress in human skeletal muscle after exercise. We compared the effects of cold water
immersion versus active recovery on inflammatory cells, pro-inflammatory cytokines, neuro-
trophins and heat shock proteins (HSPs) in skeletal muscle after intense resistance exercise.
Nine active men performed unilateral lower-body resistance exercise on separate days, at least
1 week apart. On one day, they immersed their lower body in cold water (10°C) for 10 min
after exercise. On the other day, they cycled at a low intensity for 10 min after exercise. Muscle
biopsies were collected from the exercised leg before, 2, 24 and 48 h after exercise in both trials.
Exercise increased intramuscular neutrophil and macrophage counts, MAC1 and CD163 mRNA
expression (P < 0.05). Exercise also increased IL1β, TNF, IL6, CCL2, CCL4, CXCL2, IL8 and LIF
mRNA expression (P < 0.05). As evidence of hyperalgesia, the expression of NGF and GDNF
mRNA increased after exercise (P < 0.05). The cytosolic protein content of αB-crystallin and
HSP70 decreased after exercise (P < 0.05). This response was accompanied by increases in the
cytoskeletal protein content of αB-crystallin and the percentage of type II fibres stained for
αB-crystallin. Changes in inflammatory cells, cytokines, neurotrophins and HSPs did not differ
significantly between the recovery treatments. These findings indicate that cold water immersion

Introduction
Our group has previously reported that, compared
with active recovery, regular application of cold water
immersion
after
exercise
reduces
gains
in
muscle
mass and strength following 3 months of resistance
training (Roberts et al. 2015b). Cold water immersion
may have attenuated long-term adaptive responses to
resistance exercise by modulating inflammation and
cellular stress. There exists a long-standing belief that by
reducing temperature and blood flow in skeletal muscle,
cryotherapy such as icing or cold water immersion
reduces the metabolic rate of and/or inflammation in
tissues within and around the injured site in skeletal
muscle. This supposedly protects neighbouring cells
against ischaemia after injury, which is thought to reduce
the risk of secondary cell injury or death (Bleakley et al.
2010). Animal studies demonstrate the effectiveness of
ice massage (Puntel et al. 2011; Takagi et al. 2011; Vieira
Ramos et al. 2016) or local infusion of cold saline (Lee
et al. 2005; Schaser et al. 2007) for reducing inflammation
in muscle following injury. However, no research has
examined whether cold water immersion reduces local
inflammation in human skeletal muscle after resistance
exercise.
Understanding the effects of treatments such as cold
water immersion and active recovery on inflammation
within skeletal muscle after exercise is important. Cold
water immersion is a widespread practice among various
sports, and a growing body of evidence suggests that
this strategy may affect muscle recovery from strenuous
exercise. Repair of skeletal muscle tissue following injury
is complex. It involves interactions between inflammatory
cells, satellite cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells, and a
range of soluble factors secreted by these cells (Chazaud,
2016). Reducing inflammation in muscle after injury often
impedes muscle repair (Urso, 2013). The notion that the
anti-inflammatory effects of cryotherapy such as icing
or cold water immersion is beneficial for muscle repair
has underpinned sports medicine practice for many years
(Meeusen & Lievens, 1986). However, research directly
supporting this notion in humans is currently lacking.
The aim of the current study was to investigate whether
cold water immersion reduces local inflammation in
muscle following exercise compared with active recovery.
To conduct this analysis, we used muscle samples that we
collected as part of a large study (Roberts et al. 2015b).
In this large study, we compared cold water immersion
with active recovery for two reasons. First, active recovery
in the form of a low-intensity ‘warm down’ is also a
common strategy that athletes use to recover after exercise
(Reilly & Ekblom, 2005) in the belief that it helps to
reduce soreness and remove metabolic by-products in
muscle after exercise. Second, compared with remaining
sedentary, active recovery after exercise increases cardiac
outputandmusclebloodflow,andreducestotalperipheral
resistance (Bangsbo et al. 1994; Journeay et al. 2005). We
have also previously demonstrated that active recovery
and cold water immersion cause divergent changes in
cardiac output, temperature, and microvascular blood
flow in muscle after exercise (Roberts et al. 2015a). In
the current study, we measured the following: neutrophil
and macrophage infiltration in muscle, because these
cells are important mediators of inflammation during
muscle repair (Tidball & Villalta, 2010); intramuscular
gene expression of cytokines and chemokines, because
they recruit inflammatory cells to damaged muscle tissue
(Peterson et al. 2006; Shireman et al. 2007; Kohno et al.
2011; Zhang et al. 2013) and regulate muscle repair
(Broussard et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2007; Serrano et al. 2008;
Yahiaoui et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2013); intramuscular
gene expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) and glial
cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), because they
mediate pain and nociceptor activity in muscle (Murase
et al. 2010; Murase et al. 2013); and the heat shock
proteins HSP70 and αB-crystallin, because they have
a cytoprotective role, prevent aggregation of denatured
proteins, and stabilize the cytoskeleton in cells (Morton
et al. 2009). We hypothesized that compared with active
recovery, cold water immersion would attenuate leuco-
cyte infiltration and the expression of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, neurotrophins as mediators of muscle soreness,
and heat shock proteins as mediators of cellular stress in
muscle after exercise.

Methods
Ethical approval
Before providing their written informed consent, all
participants were informed of the requirements and
potential risks of the study. The experimental procedures
adhered to the standards set by the latest revision of
the Declaration of Helsinki, and were approved by the
Human Research Ethics Committee of The University of
Queensland (project number 2012000662).
Experimental design
Nine physically active young men (mean ± SD age
22.1 ± 2.2 years, height 1.80 ± 0.06 m, body mass
83.9 ± 15.9 kg) completed one bout of single-leg resistance
exerciseontwoseparatedays(usingalternatelegs).Eachof
the sessions was followed by either cold water immersion
or active recovery. Muscle biopsies were collected from
the vastus lateralis of the exercised leg before and after
each training session. The order of the two trials was
randomized and counterbalanced to minimize any series
order effects. Six of the nine men completed the two
trials 1 week apart, and the other three men completed
their trials 4 weeks apart. This variation in the timing
of the trials was unavoidable, unfortunately, because the
investigator who performed the muscle biopsies (T.R.) was
not available to perform the biopsies on all of the men at
1-week intervals. All participants had at least 12 months of
experience in resistance training � 3 times per week, and
werefamiliar with allexerciseaspects ofthestudy.Thedata
presented herein are part of a large study, from which we
have previously published two papers containing separate
findings, which are described above (Roberts et al. 2015b;
Figueiredo et al. 2016).
Resistance exercises. The resistance training sessions for
the two experimental trials were identical and involved
single-leg exercises such as 45 deg leg press (six sets of 8–12
repetitions), single-leg squats (three sets of 12 repetitions),
knee extensions (six sets of 8–12 repetitions), and walking
lunges (three sets of 12 repetitions). The total duration
of the session was �45 min. All resistance training was
supervised and performed at normal room temperature
(23–25°C).
Recovery therapies. Cold water immersion was initiated
5 min after the training session. For the cold water
immersion treatment, the participants sat in an inflatable
bath (iCool iBody; iCool, Miami, Queensland, Australia)
for 10 min with both legs immersed in water up to the
waist. Water was circulated continuously and maintained
at 10.3 ± 0.5°C using a circulatory cooling unit (iCool
LITE). For the active recovery treatment, the participants
performed 10 min of active recovery at a self-selected
low intensity on a stationary cycle ergometer (Wattbike,
Nottingham, UK). The mean power output during active
recovery was 36.6 ± 13.8 W. The participants minimized
any rewarming following cold water immersion or cooling
following active recovery by not showering or bathing
for at least 2 h after the recovery therapies. We have
previously demonstrated that these recovery therapies
stimulate robust and distinct changes in muscle soreness
andlimbgirth(Robertsetal.2014),cardiacoutput,muscle
temperature and microvascular perfusion (Roberts et al.
2015a).
Blood and muscle tissue collection. Blood samples
were collected before exercise, immediately after exercise,
immediately after the recovery therapies (i.e. 15 min after
exercise) and 30 min, 1, 2, 24, and 48 h after exercise. The
blood samples were collected from an antecubital vein
into a serum separation tube (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ,
USA). Serum tubes were left to clot at room temperature
for 30 min before centrifugation at 4°C at 3000 g for
10 min to separate the serum, which was then stored
at −80°C until the day of analysis. Muscle biopsies were
collected from the midportion of the vastus lateralis while
the participants were in a fed state before exercise and
again at 2, 24 and 48 h after exercise. Pre-exercise and
2 h post-exercise biopsies were collected from the same
incision. The pre-exercise biopsy was collected with the
needle inserted in a distal direction, and the 2 h biopsy
was collected with the needle inserted in a proximal
direction. Biopsies at 24 and 48 h were collected from
separateincisions,each�3cmproximalfromtheprevious
incision, with a proximal needle insertion. This method
ensured that all biopsy sites were separated by at least 3 cm
to minimize any artefact related to inflammation resulting
from multiple biopsies. The same muscle tissue that was
analysed in the acute study section of our previous reports
(Roberts et al. 2015b; Figueiredo et al. 2016) was used for
the current analyses.
Control procedures. We attempted to minimize potential
variation in training responses by providing standardized
nutrition before and after each training session and by
instructing the participants to avoid performing any extra
exercise for 72 h before and for 48 h after each trial. On the
morning of each trial, the participants consumed the same
meal 2 h before the pre-exercise muscle biopsy and a 30 g
serve of a whey protein isolate drink after exercise before
each recovery treatment. They were then allowed to drink
only water until the 2 h biopsy was collected, at which time
they were provided with another 30 g of whey protein iso-
late to drink. The participants were instructed to consume
their habitual diet for 2 days before each experimental trial
and until the 48 h muscle biopsy. The participants were
instructedtoavoidconsuminganyadditionalsupplements
of any kind between 4 days before each pre-exercise biopsy
and the 48 h post-exercise muscle biopsy. Dietary intake

in a food diary and replicated for the second experimental
trial.
Blood and muscle tissue analysis
Creatine kinase. Serum creatine kinase activity was
measured using a spectrophotometric assay on an auto-
mated analyser (Model 7450, Hitachi, Japan).
Plasma cytokines. Plasma cytokine concentrations were
measured using commercial enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assays for interleukin (IL) 6, IL-10 and IL-1ra.
These particular cytokines were selected because they
consistently show the greatest increase following exercise;
the plasma concentrations of IL-1β, tumour necrosis
factor (TNF) α and monocyte chemotactic protein 1
(CCL2; MCP-1) do not increase to the same extent
(Peake et al. 2015). IL-6 was measured using a Quantikine
High-Sensitivity Colorimetric Sandwich ELISA (SS600B)
from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN, USA). IL-10
was measured using an OptEIA ELISA Kit II (BD-550613)
from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA, USA). IL-1ra was
measured using a Quantikine Colorimetric Sandwich
ELISA (SRA00B) from R&D Systems, Inc. Measurements
were made using a microplate reader (VERSAmax,
Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from �20 mg of
muscle tissue using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA
Universal Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA
was synthesized using the High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA
kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). mRNA
expression was then measured using RT-PCR on a
LightCycler 480 II (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg,
Germany)usingSYBRGreenIMasterMix(RocheApplied
Science). The sequences for the primers used in this
study are shown in Table 1. The geometric mean of three
housekeeping genes (i.e. chromosome 1 open reading
frame 43, charged multivesicular body protein 2A, and
endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex sub-
unit 7) was used for normalization (Vandesompele et al.
2002).Standardandmeltingcurveswereobtainedforeach
target to establish primer efficiency and single product
amplification.
Western blotting. Pieces of muscle tissue weighing
45−55 mg were homogenized and fractionated into
cytosolic and cytoskeletal fractions using a commercial
fractionation kit (ProteoExtract Subcellular Proteome
Extraction Kit, cat. no. 539790, Calbiochem, EMD
Biosciences, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
procedures. The purity of the fractions was confirmed
by
specific
markers
for
the
respective
fractions
(glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH;
cytosol and nuclear), poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP; nuclear), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2; membrane)
and desmin (cytoskeletal)). Protein concentration was
measured in triplicate using a commercial kit (DC Protein
Microplate assay, cat. no. 0113, 0114 and 0115, Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA), a filter photometer (Expert 96, ASYS
Hitech,UK),andthesoftwareprovided(Kim,ver.5.45.0.1,
Daniel Kittrich, Prague, Czech Republic).
Equal amounts of protein were loaded per well (16−50
μg) and were separated by 4−12% SDS-PAGE under
denaturizing conditions for 35−45 min at 200 V in cold
Mes running buffer (NuPAGE MES SDS Running Buffer,
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). All samples were run
in duplicate. After gel electrophoresis, the proteins were
transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane
for 90 min at 30 V using an XCell II Blot Module
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK) and
NuPAGE transfer buffer (Invitrogen). Membranes were
blocked at room temperature for 2 h in 5% fat-free
skimmed milk and 0.1% Tris-buffered saline with Tween
20 (TBST) (cat. no. 170-6435, Bio-Rad; Tween-20,
cat. no. 437082Q, VWR International, Radnor, PA,
USA; skim milk, cat. no. 1.15363, Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany). Blocked membranes were incubated over-
night at 4°C with a primary monoclonal antibody
against αB-crystallin (mouse anti-αB-crystallin, cat. no.
ADI-SPA-222, Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA)
diluted 1:4000. After incubation, membranes were washed
and incubated with a secondary antibody at room
temperature for 1 h. The membranes for αB-crystallin
immunoblotting were incubated with a secondary anti-
body diluted 1:30 000 (goat anti-mouse, cat. no. 31430,
Thermo Fisher Scientific/Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford,
IL, USA).
Membranes used for HSP70 quantification were
incubated
initially
with
another
primary
antibody
(anti-FoxO3a; data not shown) and secondary anti-
body. The primary and secondary antibodies were then
stripped from the membranes using Restore Western Blot
StrippingBuffer(cat.no.21059,ThermoFisherScientific),
blocked for 2 h at room temperature, and incubated
with the primary polyclonal antibody to HSP70 (rabbit
anti-HSP70, cat. no. ADI-SPA-812, Enzo Life Sciences)
diluted 1:4000 at 4°C overnight. The membranes were
then incubated with a secondary antibody (anti-rabbit
IgG, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked antibody, cat.
no. 7074, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA).
All antibodies were diluted in 1% fat-free skimmed milk

Laboratories), and band intensities were calculated
with molecular imaging software (Image Lab, Bio-Rad
Laboratories). All samples were analysed in duplicate, and
mean values were used for statistical analyses.
Immunohistochemistry. Cross-sections of muscle tissue,
800 μm thick, were cut using a microtome at −20°C
(CM3050, Leica Biosystems, GmbH), mounted on micro-
scope slides (Superfrost Plus, Thermo Scientific, Boston,
MA, USA), air-dried and stored at −80°C. Muscle
sections from each subject obtained at all time points
before and after both trials were mounted on the
same microscope slide. Before immunostaining, frozen
sections were air-dried and blocked in 1% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) for 30 min. Sections were then incubated with
primary antibodies (listed in Table 2) in 1% BSA over-
night at 4°C. The following primary antibodies were
used: anti-laminin to stain the inner surface of myo-
fibres (cat. no. Z009701-2; DakoCytomation, Glostrup,
Denmark; dilution 1:1000); CD66b to stain granulocytes
(cat. no. M1594; clone CLB-B13.9, Sanquin Reagents,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands; dilution 1:500); CD68 to
stain macrophages and cells with bilobed nuclei (cat. no.
M0718; clone EBM-11, DakoCytomation; dilution 1:300);
anti-αB-crystallin to stain αB-crystallin bound to cyto-
skeletal/myofibrillar structures (cat. no. ADI-SPA-222,
Enzo Life Sciences; dilution 1:200) and SC-71 to quantify
type IIa and IIx fibres (cat. no. SC-71, Developmental
Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA, USA; dilution
1:500).
After overnight incubation, the slides were washed three
times in PBS for 10 min. Sections were then incubated for
1 h with secondary antibodies diluted 1:200 in 1% BSA at
room temperature. The secondary antibodies used were
Alexa Fluor 594 F(ab�)2 fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG
(cat. no. A-11072, Invitrogen/Life Technologies), Alexa
Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG (cat. no. A-11029, Invitrogen),
CF488A goat anti-mouse IgG (cat. no. 20010, Biotium,
Hayward, CA, USA), and CF594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (cat.
no. 20112, Biotium). The fluorochrome-stained sections
were washed three times in PBS for 10 min. After the last
wash, the sections were mounted with ProLong Gold Anti-
fade reagent with 4�,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI;
Invitrogen).
Muscle sections were visualized using a high-resolution
camera (DP72, Olympus, Japan) mounted on a micro-
scope (BX61, Olympus) with a fluorescent light source
(X-Cite 120PCQ, EXFO, Canada). For leucocyte analysis,
the numbers of CD66b- and CD68-positive cells, and the
total number of muscle fibres from the area examined were
counted (see Figs 2 and 3). The data are presented as the
number of CD66b- or CD68-positively stained cells per
100 skeletal muscle fibres. For the αB-crystallin analysis,
the numbers of αB-crystallin-positive and -negative fibres
were counted. A fibre was considered positive if the
staining inside the fibre was scattered and uneven, and
negative if the staining was homogeneous. The data
are presented as the percentage of αB-crystallin-positive
fibres. Areas of sections that contained freeze damage
or were folded during the cutting procedure were not
included in the analyses.
Statistical analysis
Before statistical analysis, all data were checked to
determine if they were normally distributed. Log trans-
formations were applied to data that were not normally

NGF mRNA; serum creatine kinase activity). Normally
distributed data (i.e. GDNF mRNA, HSP70, αB-crystallin
and plasma cytokine concentrations) were analysed using
a 2 × 3 repeated-measures ANOVA to calculate the main
effects of time and time × trial interaction. When a
significant main effect was evident (P < 0.05), a post
hoc Student’s paired t test was used to compare changes
over time and differences between the trials. Normally
distributed data are presented as the mean ± SD, and
log-transformed data are presented as the geometric
mean ± 95% confidence interval of the geometric mean.
Data that were not normally distributed (i.e. neutrophil
cell counts and CD163, IL1β, IL-6, CCL2 and HSP70
mRNA) were analysed using Friedman’s test, followed by
Wilcoxon’s signed-ranked tests to compare changes over
time and differences between the trials. Non-normally
distributed data are presented as the median ± inter-
quartile range. The false discovery rate was used to correct
for multiple comparisons.
Results
Inflammatory cell infiltration
Exercise induced a strong and sustained inflammatory
response in muscle (Fig. 1). The number of CD66b+

number at 2 h after active recovery (9-fold difference;
P = 0.015) and tended to be higher at 2 h after
cold water immersion (3-fold difference; P = 0.086).
mRNA expression of macrophage cell surface receptors
increased in muscle after exercise. As a general marker of
pro-inflammatory cells, MAC1 expression was higher than
the pre-exercise expression at 24 h (1.2-fold; P = 0.020)
and 48 h (2.4-fold; P = 0.010) after active recovery, and
48 h after cold water immersion (1.8-fold; P = 0.036). The
number of CD68+ macrophages in muscle was higher
than before exercise at 48 h after active recovery (1.5-fold
P = 0.008) and tended to be higher 48 h after cold
water immersion (1.7-fold; P = 0.071). As a marker
of anti-inflammatory macrophages, CD163 expression
was higher than the pre-exercise expression at 24 h
(6.7-fold; P = 0.008) and 48 h (3.2-fold; P = 0.011) after
active recovery, and at 24 h after cold water immersion
(3.2-fold;P=0.008).MAC1andCD163mRNAexpression
and neutrophil and macrophage counts in muscle did
not differ significantly between the trials. Representative
images of staining for CD66b+ neutrophils and CD68+
macrophages are shown in Figs 2 and 3.
Cytokines and chemokines
Exercise

the
expression
of
several
pro-
inflammatory cytokine and chemokine genes in muscle
(Figs 4 and 5). IL1β expression was higher than before
exercise at 2 h after active recovery (9-fold; P = 0.011) and
at2haftercoldwaterimmersion(27-fold;P=0.021).TNF
expression was higher than before exercise at 2 h (2.6-fold;
P = 0.004) and 24 h (2.9-fold; P = 0.005) after active
recovery, and at 2 h after cold water immersion (2.7-fold;
P = 0.026). IL6 expression was higher than before exercise
at 2 h after active recovery (11-fold; P = 0.004) and at 2 h
(8.6-fold; P = 0.008), 24 h (1.7-fold; P = 0.021), and 48 h
(2.2-fold; P = 0.015) after cold water immersion. Mono-
cyte chemotactic protein 1 (CCL2) expression was higher
than before exercise at 2 h after active recovery (21-fold;
P = 0.008) and cold water immersion (30-fold; P = 0.008),
and it remained higher at 24 h and 48 h after both trials.
Macrophage inflammatory protein 1β (CCL4) expression
was higher than before exercise at 24 h after active
recovery (2.8-fold; P = 0.019), and tended to be higher
than before exercise at 24 h after cold water immersion
(1.7-fold; P = 0.068). CCL5 expression showed a similar
pattern of changes to CCL4 (data not shown). Macrophage
inflammatory protein 2α (CXCL2) expression was higher
than before exercise at 2 h after active recovery (9.4-fold;
P < 0.001) and cold water immersion (17-fold; P < 0.001).

IL8 expression was higher than before exercise at 2 h

before exercise at 24 h after active recovery (8.9-fold;
P = 0.030) and tended to be higher 24 h after cold water

factor (LIF) expression was higher than before exercise at
2 h after active recovery (32-fold; P < 0.001) and cold
water immersion (37-fold; P < 0.001). It also tended to
be higher than before exercise at 24 h after active recovery

mRNA expression in muscle did not differ significantly
between the trials.
Neurotrophins
Exercise stimulated the expression of two neurotrophins
associated with muscle soreness in muscle (Fig. 6). GDNF
and NGF expression increased in muscle after exercise.
GDNF expression was higher than before exercise at 2 h
after active recovery (3.7-fold; P = 0.001) and cold water
immersion (4.3-fold; P < 0.001). NGF expression was
higher than before exercise at 24 h after active recovery
(2.0-fold; P = 0.040), and at 2 h (1.2-fold; P = 0.040),
24 h (2.1-fold; P = 0.010) and 48 h (1.5-fold; P = 0.010)
after cold water immersion. GDNF or NGF expression in
muscle did not differ significantly between the trials.
HSPs
HSP70 mRNA expression was higher than before exercise
at 2 h after active recovery (2.1-fold; P = 0.013) and
cold water immersion (2.0-fold; P = 0.028) (Fig. 7).
The protein content of HSP70 in the cytosol fraction of
muscle homogenates was lower than before exercise at 2 h
(14%; P = 0.032) and 48 h (15%; P = 0.034) after active
recovery, and at 2 h after cold water immersion (18%;
P = 0.044) (Fig. 8). The protein content of HSP70 in the
cytoskeletal fraction was unchanged after both trials. The
protein content of αB-crystallin in the cytosol fraction
of muscle homogenates was lower than before exercise
at 2 h after both active recovery (−33%; P = 0.001)
and cold water immersion (−36%; P = 0.003) (Fig. 8).

rest of the post-exercise recovery period in both trials.
Conversely, the protein content of αB-crystallin in the
cytoskeletal fraction of muscle homogenates showed a
strong trend toward an increase after exercise (P = 0.052).
This response was accompanied by an increase in the
percentage of αB-crystallin-positive fibres (Fig. 9). The
median percentage of αB-crystallin-positive fibres was
26% (interquartile range 3−77%) at 2 h after active
recovery and 19% (interquartile range 2−43%) at 2 h
after cold water immersion. Staining for αB-crystallin was
scattered and evident mainly in type II fibres (Fig. 9). The
percentage of αB-crystallin-positive fibres did not differ
significantly between the trials.
Creatine kinase and cytokines
A systemic indirect marker of muscle damage, serum
creatine kinase activity, increased moderately after both
exercise trials (P < 0.05) (Fig. 10). It remained elevated
up to 48 h after active recovery (P < 0.05). Plasma
IL-6 concentration also increased moderately after both
exercise trials, and remained elevated up to 2 h after
exercise (Table 2). By contrast, the plasma concentrations
of IL-10 (P = 0.40) and IL-1ra (P = 0.24) did not change
after either trial (Table 2). The magnitude of the changes
in creatine kinase and cytokines was consistent with the
intermittent nature and limited muscle mass used for the
single-leg resistance exercise. There were no significant
differences in serum creatine kinase activity or plasma
cytokine concentrations between the trials.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the
effects of cold water immersion versus active recovery
on
inflammation,
neurotrophins
and
HSPs
within
skeletal muscle following exercise in humans. Exercise
stimulated intramuscular inflammation, as demonstrated
by increased mRNA expression of MAC1 and CD163, and
increased the numbers of neutrophils and macrophages.
Intramuscular gene expression of cytokines and neuro-
trophins also increased, and HSPs translocated from the
cytosol to cytoskeletal structures in muscle after exercise.
Contrary to our hypothesis, these responses did not differ
substantially between cold water immersion and active
recovery. These findings provide evidence against the
traditional notion that cryotherapy such as cold water
immersion helps to restrict inflammation and cellular
stress responses in muscle following exercise. Taking into
account our previous observation that regular application
of cold water immersion attenuated long-term muscle
adaptation compared with active recovery (Roberts et al.

not due to a reduction in inflammation and/or cellular
stress after cold water immersion.
Animal studies have demonstrated that icing (Puntel
et al. 2011) or infusing cold saline (Lee et al. 2005; Schaser
et al. 2007) into injured muscle of rats reduces leuco-
cyte rolling and adhesion, and neutrophil infiltration
and activation. By contrast, another study found that
cold water immersion did not reduce leucocyte counts
in muscle of rats after exercise (Camargo et al. 2012).
Icing reduces and/or delays macrophage infiltration in
rat muscle after muscle injury (Takagi et al. 2011; Vieira
Ramos et al. 2016). In the present study, there were
no significant differences in the numbers of neutrophils

and macrophages, or mRNA expression of the cell
surface receptors MAC1 and CD163 between cold water
immersion and active recovery (Fig. 1).
Compared with research into the effects of cryotherapy
on cell infiltration into muscle, less is known about its
effects on the intramuscular expression of cytokines. In
the present study, we focused on changes in the gene
expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL4
(MIP-1β), CXCL2 (MIP-2α), IL-8 and LIF in muscle
after exercise because these cytokines are responsive
to mechanical loading associated with exercise (Peake
et al. 2015). They also play important roles in recruiting
inflammatory cells to damaged muscle tissue (Peterson
et al. 2006; Shireman et al. 2007; Kohno et al. 2011;
Zhang et al. 2013) and regulating muscle repair (Broussard
et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2007; Serrano et al. 2008;
Yahiaoui et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2013). Two animal
studies have reported that icing reduces the expression
of TGFβ and TNF in the days following muscle injury
(Takagi et al. 2011; Vieira Ramos et al. 2016). In the
present study, IL1β, IL6, TNF, CCL2, CXCL2, IL8 and
LIF mRNA increased in skeletal muscle after both cold
water immersion and active recovery (Figs 4 and 5).
However, cytokine expression did not differ significantly
between the cold water immersion and active recovery
trials. The effects of ice massage (Tseng et al. 2013),
cold water immersion (Vaile et al. 2008; Pointon et al.
2012; Gonzalez et al. 2014; Roberts et al. 2014), or
exposure to −30°C air (Pournot et al. 2011; Guilhem
et al. 2013) on systemic inflammatory responses to intense
eccentric exercise or resistance exercise are variable and
are relatively minor. We discovered that although plasma
IL-6 concentration increased after exercise, there was no
significant difference between the two trials. Collectively,
these findings suggest that cryotherapy does not sub-
stantially alter local or systemic inflammatory responses
to exercise-induced muscle damage.

HSP70
Figure 7. Post-exercise changes in expression of HSP70 mRNA
Data are presented as the change in the median ± interquartile
range. n = 9. ∗P < 0.05 versus pre-exercise value.
Several factors could (theoretically) account for the
differences between the present study and the animal
studies described above. First, data from animal studies
tend to indicate that icing (Puntel et al. 2011; Takagi et al.
2011; Vieira Ramos et al. 2016) is more effective than
cold water immersion (Camargo et al. 2012) for reducing
inflammation in muscle. This difference could be related
to difference in the temperature of ice compared with
cold water, which is in the range of 9−10°C. Second,
we (Roberts et al. 2015a) and others (Ihsan et al. 2013)
have demonstrated that cold water immersion reduces
muscle temperature at a depth of 3 cm and microvascular
perfusion at a depth of 1−2 cm. Because animal muscles
are smaller than human muscles, icing or cold water
immersionmayproducemoreextensivechangesinmuscle
temperature and blood flow throughout animal muscles
compared with human muscles. This may partly explain
the greater anti-inflammatory effects of icing in animal
muscle (Puntel et al. 2011; Takagi et al. 2011; Vieira
Ramos et al. 2016). Third, the animal studies described
aboveinducedmuscleinjurythroughbluntimpacttrauma
(Lee et al. 2005; Schaser et al. 2007; Puntel et al. 2011),
freeze injury (Vieira Ramos et al. 2016), or by crushing
muscle with forceps (Takagi et al. 2011). No research
has directly compared these injury models with exercise.
Yet it seems reasonable to suggest that tissue injury
and inflammation may be more severe and prolonged
after blunt impact trauma or freeze or crush injury
compared with exercise (Gayraud-Morel et al. 2009).
These differences may influence the efficacy of treatments
for muscle injury and inflammation. Finally, these studies
compared the effects of cryotherapy with no treatment, as
opposed to active recovery.
Less muscle soreness after intense exercise may be
the most consistent effect of cold water immersion
(Leeder et al. 2011; Versey et al. 2013). We did not
assess muscle soreness in the present study. However,
we have previously demonstrated that the same cold
water immersion protocol (i.e. 10 min of cold water
immersion at 10°C) significantly reduced muscle soreness
after intense resistance exercise (Roberts et al. 2014).
The mechanisms through which cold water immersion
reduces muscle soreness after exercise are unknown. At
rest (i.e. without prior exercise), topical icing of the ankle
reduces nerve conduction velocity, and increases pain
threshold and pain tolerance (Algafly & George, 2007).
These findings suggest that cryotherapy may influence
the activity of nociceptors in soft tissues. Pain and
nociceptor activity in muscle are mediated, in part, by
pro-inflammatorycytokines(Schafersetal.2003;Hoheisel
et al. 2005), bradykinin, and the neurotrophins NGF and
GDNF (Murase et al. 2010; Murase et al. 2013). NGF
and GDNF mRNA expression increases in skeletal muscle
following lengthening (eccentric) muscle contractions in
rats (Murase et al. 2010, 2013) and 60 min dynamic

knee extension exercise in humans (Romero et al. 2016).
Consistent with these responses, we found that GDNF
expression peaked at 2 h after exercise, whereas NGF
expression peaked at 24 h after exercise (Fig. 6). NGF and
GDNF expression did not differ significantly after cold
water immersion and active recovery. Therefore, these
findings suggest that the analgesic effects of cold water
immersion after exercise do not involve changes in the
expression of these neurotrophins.
HSPs
including
HSP70
and
αB-crystallin
play
important roles in cytoprotection and as molecular
chaperones to prevent aggregation of denatured proteins.
They also regulate the refolding of proteins and stabilize
the cytoskeleton in cells (Morton et al. 2009). We observed
that HSP70 mRNA expression increased (Fig. 7), whereas
the cytosolic protein content of HSP70 (Fig. 8) and
αB-crystallin (Fig. 8) in muscle decreased acutely after
both cold water immersion and active recovery, and did
not differ significantly between the trials. The increase in
HSP70 mRNA expression is consistent with the findings
of other studies (Paulsen et al. 2007). Previous studies
have reported a delayed increase (Paulsen et al. 2007,
2009) or no change (Cumming et al. 2014) in cytosolic
HSP70 content and an acute decrease (Paulsen et al.
2009; Cumming et al. 2014) in cytosolic αB-crystallin
content. The acute decrease in the cytosolic content of
HSPs after exercise reflects their mobilization to cyto-
skeletal structures, which was confirmed by the increased
αB-crystallin content in the cytoskeletal fraction, where
they may help to stabilize and protect stressed myofibrillar
proteins (Paulsen et al. 2007, 2009).
The increase in the number of αB-crystallin-positive
fibres (fibres with scattered and uneven αB-crystallin
staining) is further evidence that this stress protein
binds to damaged cytoskeletal or myofibrillar structures.
We have previously reported a similar staining pattern
after high-force eccentric exercise, and more detailed
observations with immunogold staining and electron
microscopy revealed accumulation of αB-crystallin in
Z-disks connected to disrupted sarcomeres (Paulsen et al.
2009). Consistent with other reports of the accumulation
of another small HSP (HSP27) in type II fibres after
resistance exercise (Folkesson et al. 2008), the scattered
αB-crystallin staining was evident mainly in type II
fibres in the present study. This finding suggests that the
mechanical strain on myofibrillar structures was more
pronounced in type II fibres. Collectively, the current
findings suggest that cold water immersion did not

mitigate the stress-related signals that stimulate cellular
movement of HSPs in skeletal muscle after exercise. This
may also partly explain why cold water immersion did not
significantly alter the infiltration of inflammatory cells
or cytokine gene expression in skeletal muscle following
exercise.
Several methodological considerations relating to the
present study warrant brief discussion. First, several
studies have reported that exercise with one leg induces
adaptation in the contralateral leg (Howatson & van
Someren, 2007; Starbuck & Eston, 2012; Xin et al.
2014). To address this issue, we analysed the changes
in cellular infiltration and the expression of cytokine
mRNA, neurotrophin mRNA and heat shock proteins
between the first and second bout of exercise that
each participant performed (independent of cold water
immersion or active recovery treatments). Indeed, there
were no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05)
between the first and second bouts of exercise for any
of these variables, which suggests that no adaptation
occurred in the contralateral leg between the first and
second bouts of exercise.
Second, some studies have reported that repeated
muscle biopsies can cause injury and inflammation in
muscle (Guerra et al. 2011; Van Thienen et al. 2014).
By contrast, we and others have found that repeated
muscle biopsies do not alter the expression of a wide
array of genes (Lundby et al. 2005) or the infiltration of
inflammatory cells in muscle (Paulsen et al. 2010). We
aimed to minimize injury and inflammation arising from
the muscle biopsies in two ways: (1) for the pre-exercise
and 2 h post-exercise biopsy, we inserted the biopsy
needle in opposite directions; (2) for the 24 h and 48 h
biopsies, we inserted the biopsy needle at two separate
sites, 3 cm and 6 cm distal (respectively) from the previous
incisions.
Third, we acknowledge that comparing cold water
immersion with inactive recovery may have been optimal

Figure 10. Post-exercise changes in serum creatine kinase
activity
Data are presented as the geometric mean ± 95% confidence
interval. n = 9. ∗P < 0.05 versus pre-exercise value.
for true experimental purposes. However, in reality,
athletes are unlikely to remain completely sedentary after
exercise (Reilly & Ekblom, 2005). We contend that our
comparison between cold water immersion and active
recovery is more reflective of typical athletic practice. We
also believe that the effects of active recovery itself were
relatively minor, because other research has demonstrated
little or no difference in plasma creatine kinase activity
(Saxton & Donnelly, 1995) or circulating cytokines
(including IL-6 and IL-10) (Andersson et al. 2010)
between active recovery and inactive/sedentary recovery
after
exercise.
Notwithstanding
possible
differences
between systemic versus intramuscular markers of tissue
damage/inflammation, the findings from these studies
tend to suggest that our results would have been similar if
we had included inactive/sedentary recovery rather than
active recovery. Last, we did not include women in our
study to minimize variation arising from fluctuations in
oestrogen as part of the menstrual cycle. Oestrogen is
known to influence inflammatory responses in muscle
after exercise (Tiidus, 2003). We acknowledge that our
results may not be applicable to women.
In conclusion, contrary to popular anecdotal belief
and the findings from preclinical studies on cryotherapy
treatmentsformuscleinjury,wefoundthatcomparedwith
active recovery, cold water immersion did not significantly
reduce inflammation or cellular stress within muscle after
exercise. It is important to consider the implications of
thesefindingswithinthebroadercontextofunderstanding
the factors that regulate inflammatory responses in muscle
after exercise, and managing athletic conditioning and
recovery. Considering the large differences in cardiac
output, temperature and microvascular blood flow in
muscle that occur after cold water immersion versus
active recovery (Roberts et al. 2015a), the present findings
suggest that these physiological factors are not major
determinants of local inflammation and cellular stress
in human muscle after exercise. Cold water immersion
consistently improves perceptions of fatigue and muscle
soreness (Stanley et al. 2012) and enhances recovery of
muscle function/performance following exercise (Leeder
et al. 2011; Versey et al. 2013; Roberts et al. 2014). It
also reduces clinical signs of inflammation such as limb
swelling/oedema after exercise (Yanagisawa et al. 2003;
Yanagisawa et al. 2004; Roberts et al. 2014). Therefore,
it would appear that cold water immersion may still
confer some short-term clinical and/or functional benefits
for athletes, without any changes in local inflammatory
reactions within skeletal muscle during recovery from
exercise. Periodic use of cold water immersion may assist
athletes when they need to recovery quickly between
training sessions or competitive events. However, in
the long term, regular cold water immersion appears
to be detrimental for developing muscle strength and
hypertrophy.
