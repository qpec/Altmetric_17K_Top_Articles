Blocking Programmed Death–1 (PD-1) can reinvigorate exhausted CD8 Tcells (TEX) and improve
control of chronic infections and cancer. However, whether blocking PD-1 can reprogram TEX
into durable memory Tcells (TMEM) is unclear. We found that reinvigoration of TEX in mice by
PD-L1 blockade caused minimal memory development. After blockade, reinvigorated TEX
became reexhausted if antigen concentration remained high and failed to become TMEM upon
antigen clearance.TEX acquired an epigenetic profile distinct from that of effector Tcells (TEFF)
and TMEM cells that was minimally remodeled after PD-L1 blockade.This finding suggests that
TEX are a distinct lineage of CD8 Tcells. Nevertheless, PD-1 pathway blockade resulted in
transcriptional rewiring and reengagement of effector circuitry in the TEX epigenetic landscape.
These data indicate that epigenetic fate inflexibility may limit current immunotherapies.
P
ersisting antigenic stimulation during chron-
ic infections and cancer can result in T cell
exhaustion, a state of impaired effector func-
tions, high expression of inhibitory receptors
including Programmed Death–1 (PD-1, or
CD279), transcriptional reprogramming, and de-
fective immune memory (1). Collectively, these
properties prevent optimal control of persisting
pathogens and tumors. Blocking the PD-1:PD-L1
pathway can reinvigorate exhausted CD8 T cells
(TEX), improving effector functions and enhancing
viral and tumor control (1). Recently developed
inhibitors of the PD-1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte–
associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) pathways represent
a new paradigm incancertreatment (2–4). Although
promising, the majority of patients fail to de-
velop durable responses, and most eventually
progress (2–4). Thus, it is unclear whether blocking
PD-1 can promote long-lasting improvements
and immunological memory development in TEX.
To address this question, we analyzed the cel-
lular, transcriptional, and epigenetic changes
associated with PD-1 pathway blockade using
the mouse model of chronic lymphocytic chorio-
meningitis virus (LCMV) infection (fig. S1, A to C)
(5, 6). After treatment with antibodies against
PD-L1 (anti-PD-L1), 1080 genes were up-regulated
and 1686 genes were down-regulated [P < 0.05,
log2 fold change (LFC) ≥ 0.2] (Fig. 1A, fig. S1D,
and table S1). Previous studies identified tran-
scriptional (7) or cellular (8, 9) changes in meta-
bolic pathways after PD-1 pathway blockade.
Indeed, several metabolic genes were altered
following PD-L1 blockade (table S1). Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), however, identi-
fied more prominent changes in cell division
pathways (Fig. 1B and table S2) (5, 10). In ad-
dition, many effector-related genes were biased
toward the anti-PD-L1 group (Fig. 1, C and D, and
table S3). Other genes of interest included Cxcl9,
Il1r2, and Il7r (up-regulated) and Klra9, Tnfrsf9,
and Cd200r2 (down-regulated) (fig. S1D and table
S1). Using leading-edge metagene (LEM) analysis
(11), we identified two metagenes in anti-PD-L1–
treated TEX compared to control TEX; one cor-
responding to leukocyte activation and one to
cell cycle (Fig. 1E; fig. S1, E and F; and table S4).
The anti-PD-L1–treated TEX metagenes displayed
some overlap with effector T cells (TEFF), largely
driven by cell cycle pathways, but minimal overlap
with TMEM (Fig. 1E and table S4), suggesting
limited acquisition of memory potential upon
TEX reinvigoration.
PD-1 pathway blockade can reactivate functions
in TEX, but whether reinvigoration is sustained is
unclear. There was a robust reinvigoration of TEX,
as expected (Fig. 1, F and G, and figs. S1, A and B,
and S2) (5), and expansion peaked ~3 weeks after
initiation of blockade. By 8 to 11 weeks after
treatment, however, this reinvigoration was lost,
and the quantity, proliferation, effector function,
and inhibitory receptor expression of LCMV-specific
CD8 T cells in the anti-PD-L1–treated mice were
comparable to those in control-treated mice (Fig.
1, F to H, and figs. S2 to S4). Moreover, although
anti-PD-L1 treatment reduced viral load imme-
diately after treatment, 4 months later, viral load
was similar to that in control-treated mice (Fig. 1I).
Lastly, 18 to 29 weeks after cessation of blockade,
the transcriptional profiles of control- and anti-
PD-L1–treated groups were similar (Fig. 1J, figs.
S5 and S6, and tables S5 and S6). Collectively,
these data indicate that when antigen concentra-
tion remains high, TEX that were reinvigorated
by PD-1 pathway blockade become “reexhausted.”
OnepossiblereasontheeffectsofPD-L1blockade
were not sustained is that the infection persisted.
We hypothesized that if the infection were cleared,
anti-PD-L1 might induce differentiation into TMEM.

 To test this idea, we transferred equal numbers
of control TEX, anti-PD-L1–treated TEX, or TMEM
into antigen-free mice and monitored persistence
(fig. S7A). Consistent with previous studies (12, 13),
TEX survived poorly in antigen-free recipients
compared to functional TMEM (Fig. 2, A and B).
There was a trend toward anti-PD-L1–treated
TEX persisting somewhat longer, though survival
was poor compared to TMEM (Fig. 2, A and B).
We next investigated potential mechanisms for
this trend. After PD-1 pathway blockade, the num-
ber of interleukin-7 (IL-7) receptor transcripts
(Il7r; CD127) increased significantly (fig. S1D and
table S1). There was also a modest increase in
CD127 protein abundance on a subset of TEX after
anti-PD-L1 treatment (Fig. 2, C to E). Upon stim-
ulation with IL-7, anti-PD-L1–treated TEX also
showed more phospho-STAT5 (signal transducer
and activator of transcription 5) compared to
control-treated TEX (Fig. 2F and fig. S7B). By
contrast, expression of the IL-15 receptor subunit
CD122 and responsiveness to IL-15 in vitro were
not substantially altered (Fig. 2, C and F, and fig.
S7B). These data suggest that anti-PD-L1 treatment
may augment activity of the memory-biased
IL-7R pathway.
Treatment with IL-7 starting in the effector
phase can prevent development of exhaustion
(14, 15). However, later in chronic infection, TEX
respond poorly to IL-7 (12, 13). Because anti-PD-L1
improved IL-7R signaling, we tested whether com-
bined treatment had additional benefit (fig. S7C).
Indeed, although other aspects of the response
were less affected, treatment with IL-7 and anti-
PD-L1, but not IL-7alone, resultedin more antigen-
specific CD8 T cells and improved coproduction
of interferon-g (IFN-g) and tumor necrosis factor–a
(TNF-a) (Fig. 2, G to H, and fig. S7, D to H). Thus, it
may be possible to exploit pathways up-regulated
by PD-L1 blockade, including IL-7R, to improve
checkpoint blockade.
We next examined whether PD-1 pathway
blockade could restore robust recall potential
upon reinfection, a defining property of TMEM.
Equal numbers of DbGP33+ CD8 TEX, anti-PD-
L1–treated TEX, or TMEM were transferred into
antigen-free mice, rested, and then rechallenged
with Listeria monocytogenes expressing GP33-41.
TMEM robustly expanded and efficiently produced
IFN-g (Fig. 3, A to D). By contrast, both control- and
anti-PD-L1–treated TEX mounted poor responses
to Listeria-GP33 challenge, and reinvigorated TEX
were as defective as control TEX in these key prop-
erties (Fig. 3, A to D).

 After antigen withdrawal, TEX and anti-PD-
L1–treated TEX failed to down-regulate PD-1 (Fig.
3E), consistent with Pdcd1 locus DNA methyla-
tion and long-term expression of PD-1 (16–18).
TEX also have lower global diacetylated histone
H3 (19), but how this relates to differentiation
is unclear. We hypothesized that the genome-wide
epigenetic landscape of TEX may contribute to the
lack of durable improvements after PD-1 pathway
blockade. Thus, we performed global chromatin
landscape mapping using assay for transposase-
accessible chromatin with high-throughput se-
quencing (ATAC-seq) (20) (fig. S8). The majority
of open chromatin regions (OCRs) identified were
in intergenic regions (33.3 to 43.3%) or introns
(43.4 to 48.5%) (fig. S9A), as expected (21). TEFF,
TMEM, and TEX showed substantial chromatin re-
modeling compared to TN (Fig. 3F and fig. S9, B
and C), and genes with transcriptional start sites
(TSS) within 20 kb of OCRs tended to be more
highly expressed (fig. S10). OCRs at specific genes
illustrated distinct patterns for TEFF, TMEM, and
TEX. For example, TEX lacked several OCRs pre-
sent in the Ifng locus in TEFF and TMEM (Fig. 3G,
blue boxes). Similarly, for Pdcd1, TEX-specific OCRs
were identified in the “B” and “C” regions (Fig. 3G,
black box) (9, 22, 23) and a previously unidentified
OCR ~23 kb from the TSS (Fig. 3G, red box).
Global hierarchical clustering and cocluster anal-
ysis showed that TEFF and TMEM were more sim-
ilar to each other than to TEX and that TEX had a
distinct global epigenetic landscape (Fig. 3, H to J,
and figs. S11 to S13). These data suggest that TEX
may represent a distinct lineage of CD8 T cells.
Two subsets of TEX have been defined based
on expression of Eomes, T-bet, and PD-1 (24, 25),
and additional heterogeneity has recently been
described (26–28). The T-bethiEomeslo PD-1int sub-
set can be reinvigorated by PD-1 pathway blockade,
whereas the EomeshiPD-1hi subset is more terminal
and responds poorly to blocking PD-1 (24, 25). In
this study, TEX were ~80% Eomeshi and ~20%
T-bethi, and this distribution changed minimally
upon anti-PD-L1 treatment (fig. S14, A to C). The
transcriptional and epigenetic profiles of TEX
and anti-PD-L1–treated TEX were significantly en-
riched for genes from the Eomeshi subset (fig. S14,
D and E) (29). However, there was also a trend
toward enrichment of genes from the PD-1intTbethi
TEX subset in the anti-PD-L1–treated group (fig.
S14, F and G), perhaps reflecting recent conver-
sion of Tbethi cells into Eomeshi cells or addi-
tional heterogeneity.
We next examined the ability of PD-1 pathway
blockade to reprogram the epigenetic landscape
of TEX. Hierarchical clustering, co-clustering, and
principle-component analysis showed considerable

 similarity between control and anti-PD-L1–treated
TEX (Fig. 3, H to J, and fig. S11). OCRs preferen-
tially found in both TEX and anti-PD-L1–treated
TEX were located near Pdcd1, Il10, Ctla4, Cxcr5,
and elsewhere, suggesting state-specific regu-
lation that was not substantially altered after PD-
L1 blockade (fig. S13). Although globally, the
epigenetic changes were modest, cocluster anal-
ysis identified a small subset of OCRs specifically
enriched in TEX (555 peaks) or anti-PD-L1–treated
TEX (98 peaks) (Fig. 3, H to I; fig. S13; and table
S7). Some of these genes showed the same trend
epigenetically and transcriptionally (e.g., CD200r;
fig. S10E), and specific biological pathways were
enriched in sets of genes near OCRs that were
unique to each cell type. (fig. S15).
TEX displayed ~6000 unique OCR changes com-
pared to TEFF and TMEM (Fig. 3, F to I). Thus, the
~650 OCR changes induced by PD-L1 blockade

these changes affected specific transcriptional
circuits, we identified transcription factor (TF)
motifs enriched in peaks gained [e.g., nuclear
factor kB (NF-kB), Jun:AP-1 (activator protein 1),
and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)] or lost [e.g.,
nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic
1 (NFATc1), NFAT:AP1, Nur77, Eomes, and Egr2]
(Fig. 4A). We hypothesized that reinvigoration
resulted from rewired transcriptional control
within the existing TEX epigenetic landscape.
To test this notion, we performed Wellington
bootstrap analysis to predict TF binding activity
(Fig. 4B and table S10). TEX and anti-PD-L1–
treated TEX were more similar to each other than
to TN, TEFF, or TMEM. However, TF motifs biased
toward TEX or anti-PD-L1–treated TEX were iden-
tified (Fig. 4B and table S10). TF footprinting
was then performed to identify TFs with evi-
dence of likely binding (Fig. 4C and figs. S16
and S17). An integrated network was then con-
structed for transcriptional circuitry based on
predicted TF activity (Fig. 4D and table S11). This
network identified augmented activity of NF-kB,
interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), and bZip
factors (AP-1 family) and decreased activity of
NFAT, Egr2, and Nur77 upon PD-L1 blockade.
Major features of this transcriptional network
were recapitulated with a second network ap-
proach in which additional TF families were
identified (e.g., Runx, Nr2f6, Prdm1, Rarb, Pparg.
Rxra, and homeobox TFs; fig. S18 and table S12).
To further investigate how these changes might
affect a specific TF, we examined NFAT. NFAT work-
ing with AP-1 transactivates many effector-phase

 genes. By contrast, “partnerless” NFAT that fails
to bind AP-1 induces a subset of TEX genes (30).
Here, upon anti-PD-L1 treatment, there was signif-
icantly reduced expression of targets of partnerless
NFAT in reinvigorated TEX (Fig. 4E), suggesting a
rewiring of this transcriptional circuit after blockade.
Together, these data suggested that, although
PD-1 pathway blockade did not fully reprogram
TEX into TMEM or TEFF, these cells may (re)acquire
some features of TEFF biology. One hypothesis is
that upon PD-L1 blockade, the rewired transcrip-
tional network allows TEX to preferentially re-
engage features of their epigenomic program that
overlap with TEFF. To test this idea, we separated
TF target genes into those containing OCRs that
were (i) specific to TEFF, (ii) specific to TEX, or
(iii) shared between TEFF and TEX (Fig. 4F). We
then examined the change in genes expressed in
each categoryafterPD-L1blockade. ForseveralTFs,
including T-bet and Eomes, there was no redis-
tribution of the pattern of target gene expression
(Fig. 4F). However, for many TFs identified above
that have a key role in effector biology, such as
NF-kB, IRF1, IRF2, Nur77, and Blimp-1 (encoded
by Prdm1), there was an increase in the number
of target genes expressed in the TEFF and TEX
overlap group compared to the TEX-only group
upon PD-L1 blockade (Fig. 4F). Moreover, genes
in the shared TEFF and TEX epigenetic module
displayed a substantially greater magnitude of
change in expression than genes in the TEX-only
group (Fig. 4F). These data indicate that PD-
1 pathway blockade induces rewired transcrip-
tional activity, allowing TEX to more effectively
reengage modules of effector genes contained
within the epigenetic landscape of TEX. Specific
TF circuits that are altered, such as NF-kB, may
have implications for cotargeting PD-1 and TNFR
family pathways (1, 3, 31) and may be relevant for
the design of future therapeutics.
Our data suggest that in settings of severe
T cell exhaustion, reacquiring durable immune
memory may be challenging, especially if tumor
or viral antigen persists. However, our data also
indicate that PD-1 pathway blockade may reveal
opportunities to further augment T cell quality or
effector activity (e.g., NF-kB, IL-7R). Additional
strategies, such as priming new T cell responses (3),
selectively expanding less exhausted subsets (25),
or targeting multiple immunoregulatory or homeo-
staticpathways(e.g., IL-7,IL-2)simultaneously (1, 3),
may also augment acquisition of durable immunity.
Finally, these studies provide the impetus for
extending epigenetic landscape mapping to human
TEX, future evaluation of checkpoint blockade
combined with epigenetic modifiers, or epige-
nomic engineering for T cells. Thus, integrated
cellular, transcriptional, and epigenetic profiling
of TEX not only reveals mechanistic insights into
PD-1 pathway blockade–mediated reinvigoration,

Exhausted T cells in cancer and chronic viral infection express distinctive patterns
of genes, including sustained expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1).
However, the regulation of gene expression in exhausted T cells is poorly understood.
Here, we define the accessible chromatin landscape in exhausted CD8+ T cells and
show that it is distinct from functional memory CD8+ T cells. Exhausted CD8+ T cells
in humans and a mouse model of chronic viral infection acquire a state-specific
epigenetic landscape organized into functional modules of enhancers. Genome editing
shows that PD-1 expression is regulated in part by an exhaustion-specific enhancer that
contains essential RAR, T-bet, and Sox3 motifs. Functional enhancer maps may offer
targets for genome editing that alter gene expression preferentially in exhausted
CD8+ T cells.
T
cell exhaustion—an acquired state of T cell
dysfunction—is a hallmark of cancer and
chronic viral infection (1, 2), and clinical
trials of checkpoint blockade, which aim
to reverse T cell exhaustion in cancer,
have proven strikingly effective (3, 4). Chimeric
antigen receptor (CAR)–T cell therapy has also
proven highly effective for hematologic malig-
nancies (5), but the development of exhaustion
in T cells engineered to treat solid tumors re-
mains a substantial barrier to its broader use
(6). The identification of mechanisms that reg-
ulate exhausted T cells is therefore a major goal
in cancer immunotherapy.
To identify regulatory regions in the genome
of exhausted CD8+ T cells, we used an assay
for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-
throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) (7) to demar-
cate areas of accessible chromatin in mouse
antigen-specific CD8+ T cells differentiating in
response to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
(LCMV) infection (fig. S1A and table S1). Acute
LCMV infection elicits highly functional effec-
tor CD8+ T cells, whereas chronic LCMV infection
gives rise to exhausted CD8+ T cells (1–3, 8, 9).
Analysis of high-quality ATAC-seq profiles (fig.
S1, B to H) from naïve CD8+ T cells and those
at day 8 and day 27 postinfection (p.i.) (d8 and
d27, respectively) revealed that naïve CD8+
T cells underwent large-scale remodeling (Fig.
1A and fig. S2A) during differentiation [as de-
tected by DESeq2, with a false discovery rate
(FDR) < 0.05]. The majority (71%) (fig. S2A) of
chromatin-accessible regions (ChARs) either
emerged (e.g., those at the Ifng locus) or disap-
peared (e.g., Ccr7) (Fig. 1A) as naïve CD8+ T cells
underwent differentiation. The gain and loss of
ChARs were not balanced; a much larger frac-
tion of regions emerged at d8 p.i. and persisted
or emerged only at d27 than were either tran-
siently detected at d8 p.i. or lost from naïve cells
(Fig. 1B). Thus, differentiation from a naïve CD8+
T cell state is associated with a net increase,
rather than decrease, in chromatin accessibility
(fig. S2B).
Comparison of ChARs from exhausted CD8+
T cells with those found in functional effector
or memory CD8+ T cells revealed marked differ-
ences in the pattern of regulatory regions. Dif-
ferential regulatory regions between acute and
chronic infection (Fig. 1C and fig. S2C) showed
features of enhancers: They tended to be depleted
of transcription start sites (TSSs) and enriched
for intergenic and intronic areas (Fig. 1D), and
found distal to gene promoters (fig. S2D). The
magnitude of difference in the profile of regula-
