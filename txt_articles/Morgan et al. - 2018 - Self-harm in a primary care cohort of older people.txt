Self-harm in a primary care cohort of older people: 
incidence, clinical management, and risk of suicide and other 
causes of death

Summary
Background Self-harm is a major risk factor for suicide, with older adults (older than 65 years) having reportedly 
greater suicidal intent than any other age group. With the aging population rising and paucity of research focus in 
this age group, the extent of the problem of self-harm needs to be established. In a primary care cohort of older adults 
we aimed to investigate the incidence of self-harm, subsequent clinical management, prevalence of mental and 
physical diagnoses, and unnatural-cause mortality risk, including suicide.
Methods The UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink contains anonymised patient records from general practice that 
routinely capture clinical information pertaining to both primary and secondary care services. We identified 
4124 adults aged 65 years and older with a self-harm episode ascertained from Read codes recorded during 2001–14. 
We calculated standardised incidence and in 2854 adults with at least 12 months follow-up examined the frequency of 
psychiatric referrals and prescription of psychotropic medication after self-harm. We estimated prevalence of mental 
and physical illness diagnoses before and after self-harm and, using Cox regression in a matched cohort, we examined 
cause-specific mortality risks.
Findings Overall incidence of self-harm in older adults aged 65 years and older was 4·1 per 10 000 person-years with 
stable gender-specific rates observed over the 13-year period. After self-harm, 335 (11·7%) of 2854 adults were referred 
to mental health services, 1692 (59·3%) were prescribed an antidepressant, and 336 (11·8%) were prescribed a tricyclic 
antidepressant (TCA). Having a diagnosed previous mental illness was twice as prevalent in the self-harm cohort as 
in the comparison cohort (prevalence ratio 2·10 [95% CI 2·03–2·17]) and with a previous physical health condition 
prevalence was 20% higher in the self-harm cohort compared to the comparison cohort (1·20 [1·17–1·23]). Adults 
from the self-harm cohort (n=2454) died from unnatural causes an estimated 20 times more frequently than the 
comparison cohort (n=48 921) during the first year. A markedly elevated risk of suicide (hazard ratio 145·4 [95% CI 
53·9–392·3]) was observed in the self-harm cohort.
Interpretation Within primary care, we have identified a group of older adults at high risk from unnatural death, 
particularly within the first year of self-harm. We have highlighted a high frequency of prescription of TCAs, known 
to be potentially fatally toxic in overdose. We emphasise the need for early intervention, careful alternative prescribing, 
and increased support when older adults consult after an episode of self-harm and with other health conditions.

Introduction
Suicide is a major public health issue worldwide. With 
consideration of socioeconomic differences between 
regions, suicide risk rises with increasing age.1,2 Data 
routinely reported from the Office for National Statistics 
(ONS) in England and Wales indicate that suicide rates 
in older women have increased in the past 5 years, 
converging toward those of younger women of working 
age. In men aged 60 years and older, suicide rates have 
increased from 12·3 per 100 000 population in 2012 to 
14·8 per 100 000 in 2015, which is higher than rates for 
male adolescents and younger male adults (10–29 years) 
at 10·6 per 100 000 in 2015.3
Non-fatal self-harm is the strongest risk factor for 
subsequent suicide.4,5 Unlike other age groups, older 
people who self-harm have an increased suicidal intent;6 
thus, although repetition rates are low compared with 
middle-aged adults, self-harm is more often fatal in 
older adults.5–7 In a UK multicentre study4 of people with 
self-harm episodes presenting in hospital, suicide risk 
was 67 times higher among people aged 60 years and 
older who had harmed themselves versus their peers 
who had not, and was three times higher than younger 
individuals aged 20–59 years who had harmed 
themselves. It is, therefore, surprising that self-harm 
among older people has received little attention 
compared with other age groups. The scarce published 
evidence on self-harm in people of an older age consists 
mostly of investigations based on hospital emergency 
department attendance,4–6,8–10 mortality statistics, or

register-based studies.8,10,11 Most report on risk factors for 
self-harm repetition or suicide4,9–11 or describe incidence, 
self-harm method, and suicide as a primary outcome.5,6,8
A 3% annual increase has been seen in the proportion 
of adults aged 60 years and older in the global 
population.12 In the UK population, the projected number 
of individuals aged 65 years and older is set to rise to 25% 
of the UK population by 2046.13 Older adults often face 
different psychosocial stressors to young or middle-aged 
adults. Decline in functional ability through multiple 
comorbid conditions,9,11,14 experience of bereavement, or 
potential social isolation5 are all associated with self-harm 
among older adults as a behavioural response to 
psychological distress. Therefore, the consideration of 
mental well-being, as endorsed by WHO to include all 
age groups across the life course15 and to align health-
care services to meet both physical and mental health 
needs in older-aged populations, is important and 
timely.16
In England, the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE) clinical guidance recommends that 
older adults are assessed by an old-age psychiatrist or 
mental health specialist after a self-harm episode because 
of raised levels of suicidal intent at older age.17 However, 
previous studies of self-harm in older people often do not 
have detail on specific clinical management after the 
index episode. A multicentre, hospital-based study4 in 
England reported that 36% of adults aged 60 years and 
older were referred back to their general practitioner 
(GP) after self-harm without onward referral to specialist 
services, contrary to the NICE guidelines. Clearly, due to 
this poor level of compliance with national guidelines, 
the clinical management of older adults after self-harm 
needs to be explored to establish where improvements 
in clinical care could be made for effective suicide 
prevention initiatives to be implemented. Furthermore, 
no published studies have investigated self-harm among 
older adults registered with a GP. Examination of only 
episodes presenting in hospital might underestimate 
self-harm incidence among older adults. Using electronic 
patient records, we aimed to investigate self-harm 
incidence, its subsequent clinical management, and 
unnatural-cause mortality risk in a large cohort of older 
adults registered with a GP.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched Embase and PubMed with initial title terms related 
to self-harm (“self-harm”, “self-injur*” “self-mutilation”, 
“self-poisoning”, “self-destructive”, “suicide”) and an older 
population (“aged”, “ageing”, “aging”, “elderly”, “old”, “older”). 
We included further combination terms related to 
epidemiology of self-harm, including “mortality”, “epidemiol*”, 
“prevalence”, “incidence”. We checked publications covering all 
ages for adult populations to ensure older age bands were 
included in results sections. Further combination searches for 
clinical management, including referrals and treatment 
prescribing, and mental and physical diagnoses, were also 
included. We searched for articles published from Jan 1, 2000, 
to Dec 31, 2017, and set no restriction on language, method, or 
quality of publication. We also checked citations of relevant 
publications. No publications were found on self-harm specific 
to older age populations at primary care level. Most studies 
relating to self-harm among adults of an older age were based 
on hospital emergency department attendance, mortality 
statistics, or register-based studies of adult populations of all 
ages. These reported on risk factors for self-harm repetition or 
suicide or described incidence, self-harm method, and suicide as 
a primary outcome. Clinical management in older adults after 
self-harm was rarely reported. One multicentre, hospital-based 
study in England reported self-harm across all adult age ranges 
and provided some data on referrals after hospital admission. 
We did not identify any publications on prescribing patterns in 
older adults after self-harm. One US study, investigating specific 
self-poisonings, detailed medication use at the time of 
self-harm. Reports on mental and physical illness diagnoses 
specific to self-harm populations were scarce. Most presented 
illness diagnoses as risk factors to suicide outcome and were 
from small psychological autopsy studies. Mortality risk 
literature was based only in hospital settings.
Added value of this study
This study is a novel primary-care-based study with linkage to 
hospital and mortality records to establish the largest primary 
care dataset of self-harm in older adults of its kind. We have 
identified a group of older adults who registered with a general 
practice as being at high risk of premature unnatural death, 
particularly within the first year of a self-harm episode. Further, 
we have identified low referral rates contrary to National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, 
which suggest that older adults should be seen by a mental 
health professional after an episode of self-harm. Additionally, 
we have identified a high rate of prescription of tricyclic 
antidepressants (TCAs); NICE guidelines clearly recommend 
their avoidance after self-harm. We have also shown an 
increased prevalence of psychiatric and physical diagnoses 
before self-harm, previously shown to be important risk factors 
for self-harm.
Implications of all the available evidence:
Our findings suggest that health-care professionals in primary 
care have the opportunity to consider self-harm risk when older 
adults consult with complex mental or physical health-care 
needs. Additionally, after self-harm in an older adult, 
improvement of referral rates and consideration of possible 
alternative medication, with particular avoidance of TCAs, 
might reduce the risk of escalating self-harm behaviour and 
associated mortality risk.

Methods
Data sources
Electronic primary care patient records, containing 
routinely collected information on symptoms, diagnoses, 
prescribed medication, and referrals to secondary care 
services, were extracted from the Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink (CPRD). This source contains over 
4·4 million active patient records from 674 registered 
general practices, covering 6·9% of the UK population. It 
is broadly representative of the national population in 
terms of age, gender, and ethnicity.18 A subset of CPRD-
registered practices located in England participate in the 
CPRD linkage scheme (approximately 60% of all UK 
CPRD practices), which enables routine linkage to ONS 
death registrations, Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) 
diagnostic coding for inpatient episodes (with the 
ICD-10), and the 2010 Index of Multiple Deprivation 
(IMD)—an ecological socioeconomic indicator.
Delineation of the study cohort
The study cohort consisted of adults aged 65 years and 
older with a self-harm episode recorded during calendar 
years from 2001 to 2014. Self-harm episodes were 
identified by Read codes from patients’ electronic 
primary care health records, which capture health-care 
interaction from multiple sources, including information 
captured during a GP consultation and notification of an 
episode to the patient’s GP after hospital attendance. 
Self-harm was defined, as in NICE Clinical Guideline 
CG16,17 as “any act of self-poisoning or self-injury, 
irrespective of motivation”. In some studies, self-harm 
classifications of non-suicidal self-injury or suicide 
attempt are applied, but these are reliant on establishing 
suicidal intent, a determination that cannot be made on 
the basis of the clinical Read codes19 recorded in the 
CPRD. Self-harm episodes in patients’ primary care 
records were therefore identified from a spectrum of 
candidate Read codes from milder forms of non-suicidal 
behaviour to near-fatal attempted suicide, with each code 
subject to rigorous clinical review (CAC-G, NK).20 The 
patient inclusion criteria for each analytical phase of the 
study are outlined in detail in the appendix.
Multiphase study designs and statistical analyses
In the first analytical phase, we calculated annual 
incidence from the number of older adults with a record 
of self-harm during each calendar year in relation to the 
total number of older adults registered with a GP who 
were at risk during the same year. Stratified on age band, 
IMD, and region of residence, we applied strata-specific 
rates to calculate directly standardised incidence of self-
harm as the outcome. The IMD is an ecological 
deprivation measure derived as a composite of several 
socioeconomic indicators for small areas based on 
practice location or patient’s residential postcode.21,22 IMD 
is ranked within each UK country (England, Scotland, 
Wales, and Northern Ireland) and is then placed in 
quintiles from least to most deprived areas. We 
categorised age in three age bands: 65–74, 75–84, and 
85+ years.
In the second analytical phase, we assessed clinical 
management as an outcome according to referrals to 
specialist mental health services and prescription of 
psychotropic medication by a GP during the year after 
the index self-harm episode. We captured psychiatric 
referrals using the Family Health Services Authority 
Psychiatry code, National Health Service specialty fields, 
and further Read codes identified as indicating a 
psychiatric referral. Psychotropic medication included 
prescriptions issued for antidepressants, antipsychotics, 
and hypnotics or anxiolytics. We stratified clinical 
management variables by gender, age group, and IMD 
quintile on the basis of general practice location.
For the third analytical phase, we implemented a 
matched cohort study design to describe mental and 
physical illness prevalence as an outcome in both a self-
harm and comparison cohort and to investigate mortality 
risk as an outcome after self-harm. We restricted the 
cohort to patients registered and up-to-standard for 
research purposes at general practices for at least a year 
before cohort entry, within England, and participating in 
the CPRD-HES-ONS linkage scheme. We included 
incident self-harm episodes recorded in the CPRD 
between Jan 1, 2001, and March 31, 2014, in which no 
previous self-harm episode was identified from both the 
primary care record and via linkage to HES records from 
ICD-10 codes X60–X84.9. Each incident episode was 
matched by age, gender, and registered practice with up 
to 20 comparison individuals with no record of self-harm 
on the index self-harm date of its corresponding matched 
case. We opted to sample this many patients in the

comparison cohort to maximise statistical power and 
precision for examination of unnatural death as a rare 
outcome.
We identified psychiatric and physical illness diagnoses 
recorded before index date entry and separately identified 
new diagnoses after the index date from Read and ICD-10 
codes recorded in CPRD or linked HES records in both 
the self-harm and comparison cohorts. The psychiatric 
diagnostic categories included depression, anxiety 
disorders, 
personality 
disorders, 
bipolar 
disorder, 
schizophrenia-spectrum 
disorders, 
and 
dementia. 
Physical health diagnoses, based on the Charlson 
comorbidity index, included cancer, cerebrovascular 
disease, chronic pulmonary disease, congestive heart 
disease, diabetes with and without complications, 
hemiplegia, metastatic tumour, mild and moderate liver 
disease, myocardial infarction, peptic ulcer disease, 
peripheral 
vascular 
disease, 
renal 
disease, 
and 
rheumatological disease. We generated dichotomous 
indicator variables for any psychiatric or physical illness. 
Additionally, we calculated the Charlson comorbidity 
index scores23 at cohort entry.
We defined classification of cause-specific mortality 
using the underlying cause of death code from ICD-10 
and included all natural deaths (all codes, excluding 
V01–Y98), all unnatural deaths (V01–Y98), and suicides 
(including open verdicts X60–X84 and Y10–Y34, 
excluding Y33.9, Y87
.0, and Y87
.2). To estimate the risk of 
all-cause and cause-specific mortality, we used Cox 
regression modelling, producing both unadjusted hazard 
ratios [HRs] and HRs adjusted by IMD quintile based on 
a patient’s postcode. Adjustments by mental illness 
diagnoses were not appropriate in this instance because 
these were suspected to be on the causal pathway. We 
did, however, report prevalence of diagnosis for serious 
mental illness before and after the index date. The index 
date of the self-harm cohort was defined as the occurrence 
of the first ever recorded self-harm event. Follow up 
started from the index date in both the self-harm cohort 
members and their matched comparators. Records were 
right-censored at the date of the first occurrence of either 
the end of the follow-up period (March 31, 2014), the 
practice last data collection date, date of transfer out of 
the CPRD (ie, patient registered with a new practice or 
practice that left the CPRD), or death. We evaluated 
the proportional hazards assumption formally using 
Schöenfeld’s residuals.24 Additionally, we estimated the 
cumulative incidence percentage values for all-cause 
mortality and specific causes of death, adjusted for 
competing risk of dying from other causes.25
All code lists applied in this study are published online 
and we used Stata/SE 14.2 for all analyses.

Results
During the 2001–14 observation period, 4124 adults aged 
65 years and older were identified as having an incident 
self-harm episode. Of these, 3327 (80·7%) involved 
ingestion of drugs, 234 (5·7%) involved self-cutting, a 
further 118 (2·9%) were by some other means, and 
435 (10·6%) had no method specified. The overall 
incidence was 4·1 per 10 000 person-years and stable 
gender-specific incidences were observed across the 
entire 13-year period (appendix). Across the whole 
observation period, similar standardised incidences for 
self-harm were observed in men and women (table 1; 
women to men rate ratio 1·03 [95% CI 0·97–1·10]). 
Compared with the reference group of people aged 
65–74 years, incidence of self-harm increased by 
31% among 75–84 year olds (rate ratio 1·31 [95% CI

1·23–1·41]) and by 76% among patients 85 years and 
older (1·76 [1·62–1·91]). For practice-level deprivation, the 
rate ratios were significantly raised for the middle and 
most deprived IMD quintiles (ie, for quintile 3, rate ratio 
1·14 [95% CI 1·04–1·26]) and for quintile 5, 1·16 
[1·05–1·29]; table 1).
Within 12 months of their initial self-harm episode, 
335 (11·7%) of 2854 older adults were referred to mental 
health services, although more women were referred 
than men (13·1% vs 9·7%; χ²=7·84; p=0·005; table 2). 
Additionally, older adults from general practices in the 
most deprived localities were 33% less likely to be referred 
in the first 12 months after an index self-harm episode 
compared with older adults from practices in the least 
deprived areas (HR 0·67 [95% CI 0·45–0·99]). 
In women, 1288 (75·1%) of 1716 were prescribed 
psychotropic medication compared with 744 (65·4%) of 
1138 men (table 2). Psychotropic medication was more 
frequently prescribed to patients in the youngest age 
group (65–75 years) versus the oldest age group (85+ years; 
73·0% vs 66·2%; χ²=5·49, 1 df; p=0·01). Women were 
more often prescribed psychotropic medication than men 
across all psychotropic medication categories (table 3) 
and the most frequently prescribed psychotropic 
medication type was antidepressants (1692 [59·3%] of 
2854; table 3). Overall, 336 (11·8%) of 2854 older adults 
were prescribed a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) within 
12 months of their index self-harm episode. In the year 
after the index self-harm episode, 412 (14·4%) individuals 
had a further self-harm episode, of whom 344 (83·5%) 
had one repeat record and 68 (16·5%) had two or more 
further episodes.
2454 older adults were in the linked self-harm cohort and 
48 921 were in the matched comparison cohort (59·6% 
women and 40·4% men). A diagnosed previous mental

in the self-harm cohort. The Charlson comorbidity index 
condition categories of 0, 1, or 2 were more prevalent 
in the comparison cohort than in the self-harm cohort 
(prevalence ratio 0·72 [95% CI 0·68–0·76]) and 
categories 3–5 and greater, which indicated higher 
multimorbidity levels, were more prevalent in the self-
harm cohort (appendix).
A total of 908 (37·0%) deaths occurred in the self-harm 
cohort compared with 12 683 (25·9%) deaths in the 
comparison cohort, of which 54 (5·9%) were unnatural 
deaths and 36 (4·0%) were suicides in the self-harm 
cohort versus 275 (2·2%) unnatural deaths and 
12 (<0·1%) suicides in the comparison cohort (appendix). 
Mortality risk was found to change according to length of 
follow up, with markedly greater HRs observed for the 
first follow-up year (figure). Compared with their peers 
who had not harmed themselves, adults in the self-harm 
cohort were an estimated 20 times more likely to die 
unnaturally during the first year (IMD-adjusted HR 19·65 
[95% CI 11·69–33·05]) after a self-harm episode and 
3–4 times more likely to die unnaturally in subsequent 
years (3·41 [2·17–5·35; figure). The risk of death by 
suicide markedly increased after self-harm over the 
entire 13 years of follow up (IMD-adjusted HR 145·43 
[95% CI 53·91–392·29]; appendix). Cumulative incidence 
plots and percentage values show that the self-harm 
cohort have markedly elevated risks for dying by any 
unnatural cause, and by suicide in particular, compared 
with the matched comparison cohort (appendix).
Discussion
This cohort study used CPRD, one of the world’s largest 
electronic primary health-care datasets, and found that 
referral rates to mental health services were low, with 
women more likely to be referred than men, and likelihood 
of referral from general practices in more socially deprived 
localities was lower than from less deprived areas. 
Prescription rate was high for psychotropics within 
12 months of the self-harm episode. 12% of the self-harm 
cohort were prescribed TCAs. Mental illness diagnosis 
was more than twice as prevalent with a higher level of 
multimorbidity among the self-harm cohort compared 
with the comparison cohort. We found that older adults 
(65 years and older) after self-harm were at increased risk 
of dying unnaturally, particularly of suicide, compared 
with individuals without a history of self-harm. 
This is the first study to focus on self-harm exclusively 
among an older aged population from a primary care 
perspective. We report for the first time the clinical 
management in primary care during the first year after 
self-harm and found a low rate of referral to psychiatric 
services. NICE guidelines for short-term management of 
adults after self-harm17 recommend assessment by a 
mental health practitioner because of the more frequent 
suicidal intent among older people. In a previous study4 of 
adults aged 65 year and older, after contact at accident and 
emergency hospital departments in three English cities, 
90% had an aftercare referral: 36% to outpatient care, 
36% to a primary care GP, and 19% to inpatient care. In a 
similar study6 done in three hospitals in Manchester, UK, 
comparing middle-aged adults to older adults aged 55 years 
and older, the younger age group were more likely to be 
discharged to primary care than the older adults, and a 
greater number of older individuals were admitted to 
psychiatric hospital after a psychiatric assessment. 
However, 43% were discharged to primary care.
The NICE guidance for the long-term management 
of self-harm (CG133)26 and outlined in a Do Not Do 
Recommendation27 states, “When prescribing drugs for 
associated mental health conditions to people who self-harm, 
take into account the toxicity of the prescribed drugs in 
overdose...In particular, do not use tricyclic antidepressants, 
such as dosulepin, because they are more toxic”.
We report a high proportion of TCA prescribing after 
self-harm; TCAs are known to be fatally toxic in overdose 
and some TCAs more harmful than others.28 In a US 
observational study29 of adults attending accident and 
emergency departments for drug overdose between 2004 
and 2007, the proportion of older adults using TCAs was 
significantly higher than in adults younger than 55 years. 
The authors suggested that the older age group were using 
TCAs before guideline changes regarding high toxicity in 
overdose or that TCAs might be prescribed for other 
conditions, such as neuropathic pain.
Few studies report mental health diagnoses before and 
after self-harm in older adults, with most based on 
psychological autopsy and suicide or investigating risk 
factors. In a retrospective cohort30 that used linked 
English hospital and mortality data, risk of self-harm 
was 15 times greater for adults aged 65 years and older 
diagnosed with depression, 14 times greater for those 
with bipolar disorder, 8 times greater for those with 
anxiety and neurotic disorders, and 6 times greater for 
those with a schizo 
phrenia diagnosis than for those of a 
comparison cohort of day cases and inpatients without 
the psychiatric conditions. We report greater prevalence 
across all categories of mental illness investigated in the 
self-harm cohort. In an Australian population-based 
cohort9 of hospital admissions among older adults aged 
50 years and older, 6·0% of those presenting with a self-
harm injury had three or more comorbidities from the 
Charlson comorbidity index compared with 3·6% in 
the comparison cohort of individuals who were injured 
by some mechanism other than self-harm. Older 
individuals reportedly perceive physical health as one of 
the most common precipitants of self-harm.5,6 Previous 
findings from a Danish study11 of adults aged 65 years 
and older, during a 20-year period from 1990 and 2009, 
found physical illnesses were important predictors of 
suicide and the association of physical illness with 
suicidal behaviour was acknowledged in a more recent 
systematic review.14
Within 12 months of initial self-harm, 14·4% of 
older adults had a further self-harm episode, which is

similar to findings reported from a hospital-based study4 
of adults aged 60 years and older (12·8%) attending 
five hospital emergency departments in England between 
2000 and 2007
. Among individuals in the same age range 
attending a hospital in Oxford, UK, during 1978–97, 8·2% 
had a repeat episode after deliberate self-harm.5 Although 
suicide cases were rare in our cohort from a primary care 
setting, the suicide risk was markedly elevated at 145 times 
higher than expected compared with 67 times higher 
based on a hospital setting.4
The higher rate of repetition found in our cohort and 
the markedly increased risk of suicide and unnatural 
death, particularly within 12 months of a known self-
harm episode, identify a high-risk group of older 
individuals within primary care. Additionally, with older 
aged adults showing greater suicidal intent inferred from 
previous studies,5–7 this work should alert policy makers 
and primary health-care professionals to progress towards 
implementing preventive measures among older adults 
who consult with a GP. Primary health-care professionals 
have the opportunity to intervene since older adults are 
reported to consult more frequently than younger adults 
because of their complex needs and potentially higher 
levels of psychiatric and physical multimorbidity. Since 
drug ingestion is one of the main methods of self-harm, 
we also highlight the increasing urgency for the 
consideration of alternative medication and avoidance of 
TCAs in the older age group, both in mental health and 
pain management within primary care, and recommend 
maintaining frequent medication reviews after self-harm.
The low referral rates we report and the high rates of 
referral back to primary care after hospital admission 
from previous hospital-based studies, emphasise the 
importance of a GP’s role to ensure individuals are 
assessed and monitored effectively after self-harming 
behaviour. Additionally, the inequity in referral across 
differing socioeconomic status highlights an important 
target for improvement across the health-care system.
As highlighted by a systematic review31 on interventions 
for reducing suicidal ideation among older adults, most 
studies were of low quality with the exception of two primary 
care-based, randomised controlled trials. PROSPECT, as 
part of a collaborative trial,32 investigated supportive care in 
depression of older people with the use of a combined 
intervention. This intervention involved improving the 
physicians’ knowledge of geriatric depression, a major risk 
factor for suicide, in primary care and treatment 
management through first-line SSRI use. Suicidal ideation 
significantly declined in the inter 
vention group compared 
with usual care.32 Promising non-pharmalogical inter-
ventions include an adapted interpersonal psychotherapy 
in older people to reduce suicidal ideation.33 The 
intervention was based on identifying and clarifying factors 
contributing to the individual’s psychological distress, 
enhancing social connections, engaging in physical and 
social activities, and identifying negative interpersonal 
interactions. A significant reduction in suicidal ideation 
and depression symptom severity and significant increases 
in participant social adjustment and social interactions 
were found.
The present study did, however, have some limitations. 
First, the coding recorded within the CPRD and HES 
datasets is reliant on the clinicians who assign and enter 
the codes. Second, some hospital-treated cases of self-
harm will not have been reported to an individual’s GP 
and, therefore, will not have been captured in CPRD.34 As 
recommended by the authors, we linked the CPRD 
records to national mortality records to enable analysis of 
cause-specific mortality with complete ascertainment. 
Finally, studies investigating suicide tend to under-
estimate because coroners might be reluctant to return a 
verdict of suicide more frequently in unnatural deaths of 
older people who might have strong religious affiliations, 
and levels of stigma surrounding suicide among this age 
group might cause additional distress to their families. 
To address this issue, we included open verdicts in this 
regard, which is accepted practice in the UK.35
This novel primary-care-based study with linkage to 
hospital admissions and mortality records furthers 
understanding of self-harm among older aged adults. We 
have identified a group at high risk of premature 
unnatural death and identified areas of improvement for 
clinical management of older-aged adults in primary care. 
Health-care professionals should take the opportunity to 
consider the risk of self-harm when an older person 
consults with other health problems, especially when 
major physical illnesses and psychopathology are both 
present, to reduce the risk of an escalation in self-harming 
behaviour and associated mortality.
