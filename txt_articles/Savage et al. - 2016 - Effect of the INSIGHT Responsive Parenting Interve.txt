IMPORTANCE Rapid infant weight gain is associated with later obesity, but interventions to
prevent rapid infant growth and reduce risk for overweight status in infancy are lacking.
OBJECTIVE To examine the effect of a responsive parenting (RP) intervention on infant
weight gain between birth and 28 weeks and overweight status at age 1 year.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Intervention Nurses Start Infants Growing on
Healthy Trajectories (INSIGHT) study is an ongoing randomized clinical trial comparing an RP
intervention designed to prevent childhood obesity with a safety control. The study includes
primiparous mother-newborn dyads (n = 291) and was conducted at the Penn State Milton S.
Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania, in addition to home visits. Enrollment was
initiated in January 2012, and evaluable population analyses for this study were conducted
between April 2015 and November 2015.
INTERVENTIONS At 2 weeks post partum, initial intervention materials appropriate to the
assigned treatment group were mailed to the participant’
s home. Research nurses conducted
home visits at 3 weeks, 16 weeks, 28 weeks, and 40 weeks, and a research center visit
occurred at 1 year. The Intervention Nurses Start Infants Growing on Healthy Trajectories
curriculum included messages about infant feeding, sleep hygiene, active social play, emotion
regulation, and growth record education. The control group received a developmentally
appropriate home safety intervention also delivered by nurse home visitors.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Conditional weight gain from birth to 28 weeks was
calculated. General linear models examined intervention effect on conditional weight gain.
The intervention’
s effect on infant weight-for-length percentiles was tested using analysis of
variance. Logistic regression compared the odds of overweight status (weight for length
�95th percentile) at 1 year as a function of conditional weight gain.
RESULTS Of the mothers included in the study, 246 were white (88%), 260 were
non-Hispanic (93%), 210 were married (75%), and 201 were working full time (72%) at time
of enrollment. The mean conditional weight gain score was lower among infants in the RP
group compared with the control group (−0.18; 95% CI, −0.36 to −0.001), reflecting that the
RP infants gained weight more slowly than control group infants (0.18; 95% CI, 0.02-0.34);
this effect did not differ by feeding mode (predominantly fed breast milk or not). Infants in
the RP group also had lower mean weight-for-length percentiles at 1 year than infants in the
control group (57.5%; 95% CI, 52.56%-62.37% vs 64.4%; 95% CI, 59.94%-69.26%; P = .04)
and were less likely to be overweight at age 1 year (5.5% vs 12.7%; P = .05).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE An RP intervention is associated with reduced rapid weight
gain during the first 6 months after birth and overweight status at age 1 year.

O
verweight status and rapid weight gain during in-
fancy are associated with increased fat mass, later risk
ofbeingoverweight,1-4andnumerouscomorbidities.5-7
Infancyisacriticalperiodofdevelopmentalplasticitywithlong-
lasting metabolic and behavioral consequences,8,9 and inter-
ventions developed for delivery during this period may alter
long-term risk for obesity and associated comorbidities.
Although modifiable factors that promote overweight status
and rapid growth during infancy have been identified,10-12
few preventive interventions addressing these factors have
been tested.13
Based on our previous pilot randomized clinical trial dem-
onstrating that an early responsive parenting (RP) interven-
tion focused on infant soothing, sleeping, and feeding was as-
sociated with a significant decrease in infant weight gain and
affected weight for length at age 1 year,14 we developed the
Intervention Nurses Start Infants Growing on Healthy Trajec-
tories (INSIGHT), a randomized clinical trial, to evaluate an RP
intervention designed for the primary prevention of obesity.15
Mothers received guidance on RP, which is defined as devel-
opmentally appropriate, prompt, and contingent on their in-
fant’
s needs.16 The curriculum for INSIGHT includes mes-
sages about infant feeding, sleep hygiene, active social play,
emotion regulation, and growth record education; these areas
were selected based on the overarching RP framework, their
potential to be modified, and evidence linking them to obe-
sity risk.15 Additionally, RP promotes a range of adaptive out-
comes in children including secure attachment, emotion regu-
lation, cognitive and language development, and aspects of
self-regulation including inhibitory control and executive
function.17-20
The aim of this study was to examine the effect of the RP
intervention on infant weight gain and overweight status at 1
year compared with infants in the control condition, who re-
ceived equal attention in a home safety intervention.15 Based
on prior research,21-23 the interval between birth and age 6
months was chosen to evaluate infant weight gain, and we hy-
pothesized that infants in the RP intervention would have
slower weight gain than infants randomized to the control
group, resulting in reduced overweight at age 1 year. Because
formula feeding is a risk factor for excessive weight gain in
infancy,24 a second objective was to assess whether the ef-
fects of our intervention differed between breastfed and
formula-fed infants.25
Methods
Participants
Primiparousmothersandtheirnewbornswererecruitedinper-
son by research staff shortly after delivery from 1 maternity
ward (Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, Hershey,
Pennsylvania) into the INSIGHT study (Figure 1). Participants
were told that the purpose of the study was “to see if nurse
visits to your home during your baby’
s infancy can improve
your ability to either respond to your child’
s cues related to
feeding and fussiness or improve your ability to provide safe
environment for your child and prevent injuries.” Enrollment
was initiated in January 2012, and analyses for this study were
conductedbetweenApril2015andNovember2015.Briefly,ma-
jor eligibility criteria included full-term (≥37 weeks’gesta-
tion), singleton newborns delivered to English-speaking, pri-
miparous mothers at least 20 years of age residing within 80.5
km of the medical center. Infants born at less than 2500 g were
excluded. More details have been published elsewhere.15 Ran-
domization was completed by the research nurse(s) during a
telephone call 10 to 14 days post partum. The randomization
scheme used permuted blocks (block size: 6) and stratified on
birth weight for gestational age (<50th percentile or ≥50th per-
centile) and intended feeding mode (breastfeeding or for-
mula feeding). Of 316 mother-newborn dyads who provided
written consent to participate, 291 were randomized 2 weeks
after birth, and 279 completed the first home visit at 3 to 4
weeks after birth. This study was approved by the Human Sub-
jects Protection Office of the Penn State College of Medicine
andwasregisteredathttp://www.clinicaltrials.gov priortofirst
participants’enrollment. The formal trial protocols can be
found in the Supplement.
Study Groups
The Intervention Nurses Start Infants Growing on Healthy
Trajectories RP intervention addressed 4 infant behavioral
states: drowsy, sleeping, fussy, and alert (eg, active social play
and feeding) as previously described.15 At each visit, interven-
tion components were mapped to the 4 states. For example,
age-appropriate sleep hygiene instructions promoted longer
sleep duration and avoidance of feeding to sleep. The emo-
tion regulation component encouraged parents to use alter-
native strategies besides feeding to calm a fussy infant. Par-
ents were provided with a video, The Happiest Baby on the
Block,26 and received hands-on demonstrations of these strat-
egies by visiting nurses. The feeding component taught par-
entstorecognizehunger,satietycues,andage-appropriatepor-
tion sizes and to use food for hunger only and not as a reward,
punishment, or to soothe a distressed but not hungry child.
Guidance included use of repeated exposure to promote ac-
ceptance of foods and beverages and the importance of mod-
eling healthy eating behaviors, shared feeding responsibility,
andestablishingroutinesandlimits.Theactivesocialplaycom-
ponent focused on developmentally appropriate physical ac-
tivities to engage infants, ranging from “tummy time” to
Key Points
Question Can rapid weight gain and overweight status at 1 year be
prevented by a responsive parenting intervention that is delivered
by nurse home visitors?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 279
mother-infant dyads, the responsive parenting intervention was
associated with reduced rapid weight gain, and fewer than 6% of
infants in the responsive parenting group were overweight at
age 1 year compared with 13% of control group infants,
a significant difference.
Meaning A multicomponent intervention that promotes
responsive parenting behaviors is associated with healthy growth
trajectories in infancy.

RPandthesafetycontrolinterventionincludeddetailedmanu-
als of intervention content, standardized training proce-
dures, evaluation of the research nurse’
s delivery of the cur-
riculummaterials,andregularmonitoringinthefield.Random
audio recordings of scheduled visits were reviewed, and feed-
back was provided to minimize drift in the research nurses’
skillsandabilitytoimplementthecurriculumasintended.Last,
following each study visit, the nurse home visitors and study
participants completed a checklist to monitor cross-
contamination of the intervention groups.
Following randomization, a prestudy survey was admin-
istered to mothers electronically, and initial intervention ma-
terialsappropriatetotheassignedtreatmentgroupweremailed
to the participant’
s home. Study data were collected and man-
aged using Research Electronic Data Capture27 tools hosted at
the Penn State College of Medicine. If the mother lacked reli-
able internet access, the online survey was mailed with the in-
tervention materials (n = 20). Research nurses were trained in
both RP and safety interventions, and generally, an indi-
vidual nurse completed all study visits for each family. Home
visits were conducted at infant ages 3 to 4 weeks, 16 weeks,
28 weeks, and 40 weeks, and a research center visit occurred
at 1 year.
Measures
Background Characteristics
Family demographic information was collected at enroll-
ment. Data extracted from medical records included mater-
nal age, gestational weight gain, infant gestational age, birth
weight, and length.
Feeding Mode
AmodifiedversionoftheInfantFeedingPracticesStudy2food
frequency questionnaire from the US Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention28 was administered at 2 weeks, 16 weeks,
and 28 weeks. Following the Infant Feeding Practices Study 2
study definition,28 feeding mode at 16 and 28 weeks was de-
fined as predominantly breastfed if 80% or more of milk feed-
ings were breastmilk, either at the breast or by bottle; other-
wise feeding mode was identified as not predominantly
breastfed.29
Anthropometrics
Maternal prepregnancy weight (kilograms) was extracted from
medical records. Maternal height was measured in duplicate
to the nearest 0.1 cm (n = 256) using a portable stadiometer
(Shorr Productions) or obtained from medical records (n = 23).
Maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) was calcu-
lated as prepregnancy weight in kilograms divided by height
in meters squared.
Infant birth weight and length were extracted from medi-
cal records. At each study visit, infant weight and recumbent
length were measured by trained research nurses. Prior to age
1year,theseassessmentswereconductedbytheresearchnurse
completing the home visits for both groups. At the 1-year visit,
anthropometrics were measured by research nurses blinded
to study group. Weight was measured in duplicate to the near-
est 0.1 kg using an electronic scale (Seca 354). Recumbent
length was measured in duplicate to the nearest 1 cm using a
portable stadiometer (Shorr Productions). A third measure-
ment was taken when weight and height differed by more than
0.05 kg and 1 cm, respectively. Multiple measures were aver-
aged.Infantweightforage,lengthforage,andweightforlength
at birth, 28 weeks, and 1 year were converted to percentiles and
z scores using World Health Organization data.30
Conditional Weight Gain
Following the methods of Griffiths et al,31 conditional weight
gain (CWG) scores were calculated as standardized residuals
from the linear regression of weight for age at 28 weeks on
weightforageatbirth,withlengthforageatbirthand28weeks
and infant age at the 28-week assessment entered as covari-
ates. The CWG score represents the variation in child weight
gain not explained by child age, birth length, or birth weight.
A CWG score of zero represents the population mean.31 Posi-
tiveCWGscores(abovetheestimatedregression)indicatemore
rapid or faster than average weight gain, while negative scores
(below the estimated regression) indicate slower weight gain.
Sample Size and Analysis Plan
The study was powered to detect a 0.67 difference in BMI
z score at 3 years at 90% power, 5% type I error rate, with an
anticipated attrition rate of 30%. Two hundred seventy-six
participants were required for the study cohort a priori, de-
fined as those completing the 3- to 4-week visit. The final co-
hort size of 279 resulted from additional participants who were
in the “run-in” phase of the trial when the sample size goal was
met and subsequently completed the 3- to 4-week visit.
Analysis of variance was used to examine the effect of the
RPinterventiononrapidweightgain.First,weexaminedtheef-
fectofstudygrouponCWGscoresfrombirthto28weeks(model

the CWG scores by intervention group. Weight for length at or
higher than the 95th percentile at 1 year on the WHO growth

At 28 weeks and 52 weeks, 269 (96.4%) and 253 (90.7%)
dyads remained in the study, respectively. Multiple imputa-
tion was used to account for the 10% of missing data at the
1-year weight outcome. To generate the multiple imputa-
tions, the following variables were included: infant weight at
3 weeks, maternal prepregnancy BMI, infant race/ethnicity
(whitevsother),gestationalage,infantsex,maritalstatus(mar-
ried or not), mother age at recruitment, intent to breastfeed
at 2 weeks, and study group. A Markov chain Monte Carlo im-

analysis (Proc MIANALYZE; SAS Institute), and therefore, re-
sultsareincludedforthefull-datacaseanalysisonly.Datawere
analyzed using the SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
There were no differences between RP and control groups on
demographic characteristics (Table 1) or attrition. Two hun-
dred forty-six mothers were white (88%), 260 were non-
Hispanic (93%), 210 were married (75%), and 201 were work-
ing full time (72%) at time of enrollment. Mothers were also
predominately well educated and privately insured. Com-
pared with those completing the 1-year visit, mothers of in-
fants who elected to withdraw from the study (n = 26) were
significantly younger, more likely to be single, had lower edu-
cation levels, and reported lower annual household incomes
(data not shown).
Conditional Weight Gain From Birth to Age 6 Months
by Study Group
During the first 6 months after birth, mean CWG score was
negative for RP infants (mean, −0.18; 95% CI, −0.36 to 0), re-
flecting a slower than average pattern of weight gain. In con-
trast, mean CWG score was positive for control infants (mean,
0.18, 95% CI, 0.02-0.34) , reflecting faster weight gain (model
1) as shown in Table 2 (P = .004). Figure 2 shows that the dis-
tribution of CWG scores for the control infants was shifted to
the right relative to infants in the RP group, reflecting more
rapid weight gain among control infants (Kolmogorov-
Smirnov asymptotic test, 1.6; P = .01). The effect of the RP in-
terventiononCWGfrombirthto28weeksdidnotvarybyfeed-
ingmode(predominantlybreastfedornot)at16weeks(Table2,
model 2). Results were similar when examining feeding mode
at 28 weeks and when missing data were imputed (data not
shown).
Overweight Status at Age 1 Year by Study Group
At age 1 year, 7 infants in the RP group (5.5%) were over-
weight (weight for length ≥95th percentile) compared with 16
infants (12.7%) in the control group (χ2 = 4; P = .05; Figure 3).
Children in the control group had greater mean weight-for-
lengthpercentilevaluesat1year(mean,64.4%;95%CI,59.8%-
69.0%) compared with children in the RP group (mean, 57.5%;
95% CI, 52.6-62.4) (F1,251 = 4.13; P = .04). Similar results
emerged when missing data were imputed (data not shown).
Discussion
Infants in the INSIGHT RP intervention grew less rapidly (ie,
lower CWG scores) during the first 6 months after birth, had a
lowermeanweightforlengthpercentileat1year,andhadlower
prevalence of overweight status at 1 year than control infants.
The effects of the intervention on growth and weight gain did
not differ between breastfed and formula-fed infants. Al-
though long-term data on the effects of the INSIGHT RP in-
tervention are not yet available, results are promising: in-
fants in the RP treatment had lower weight for length at 1 year,
with 5.5% of RP group infants being overweight at 1 year com-
pared with 12.7% of control group infants.
In addition to INSIGHT, 3 other trials focused on prevent-
ing obesity in infancy have reported beneficial effects on in-
fant growth or weight status: Sleeping and Intake Methods
Taught to Infants and Mothers,14 which informed the design
of INSIGHT, the Healthy Beginnings Trial,3 3 and

null findings for weight status.35 One common feature of these
trials is that only primiparous mothers and their full-term
newborns were eligible to participate. Second, except for
NOURISH, these interventions were delivered by nurses dur-
ing home visits, allowing for somewhat tailored guidance.
Third, the intervention dose was higher in the successful trials
than most of those showing null effects.35 Fourth, all pro-
vided guidance on aspects of RP, and 3 of the 4 interventions
were implemented during early infancy.
Unique to INSIGHT, instead of explicitly focusing on
nutrition, feeding, and obesity prevention in discussion with
parents, INSIGHT used a “stealth” approach to preventing
childhood obesity by promoting RP behaviors across infant
behavioral domains (drowsy, sleeping, fussy, and alert). The
focus on variables such as these is of more immediate inter-
est to most parents of infants than obesity prevention. We
hypothesized that by promoting feeding, sleeping, and
soothing within a RP framework, we could affect early
growth and obesity risk. Self-regulatory skills begin to
develop in late infancy, and infants need responsive caregiv-
ing to help them regulate distress. Teaching RP and effective
soothing strategies and allowing infants opportunities to
learn how to regulate their own distress, for example, by
self-soothing during night waking, can scaffold children’
s
developing self-regulation abilities.36 Parenting interven-
tions that increase child self-regulation may also positively
affect the development of empathy, cognitive and social
competence, ability to delay gratification, compliance, and
academic achievement.18,19,37

Responsive parenting
Control
Infants in the responsive parenting group have lower weight-for-length
percentiles at age 1 year compared with control group infants (ANOVA P = .04).
Among responsive parenting group infants, 5.5% were overweight at age 1 year
compared with 12.7% of control group infants.

a Predominately breastfed at 16 weeks defined as 80% or more breastfeeding,
either at the breast or by bottle. At 16 weeks, 48% of infants were
predominantly breastfed.
bConditional weight gain scores are the studentized residuals from the model:
weight for age at 28 weeks = weight for age at birth + length for age at birth +
length for age at 28 weeks + infant age at 28 weeks + gestational age + intent
to breastfeed declared at 2 weeks. Similar results emerged after adjusting for
the following covariates: maternal prepregnancy body mass index, income,
marital status, and maternal age at recruitment. Income was ordinally
categorized as 6 levels from less than $10 000, $10 000 to $24 999, $25 000
to $49 999, $50 000 to $74 999, $75 000 to $99 999, and $100 000 and
greater, but were treated as continuous data. These covariates were
nonsignificant and not shown.

Given that development in infancy is rapid, the timing of
intervention initiation and duration is likely to be critical. In
INSIGHT, initial intervention materials were provided at 10 to
14 days post partum, with the first home visit occurring ap-
proximately 3 weeks after birth. For SLIMTIME, the first home
visit occurred 2 to 3 weeks after birth. Healthy Beginnings
started even earlier, beginning at 30 to 36 weeks’gestation. In-
terventions reporting null results on weight outcomes35 be-
gan later, waiting until 2 to 4 months after childbirth to inter-
vene. Although rapid growth in infancy has been measured at
different times and defined multiple ways, a meta-analysis
across 10 cohort studies38 showed that rapid weight gain dur-
ing the first year of life is positively associated with subse-
quent obesity. Further, birth weight and weight during the first
weeks after birth explain substantial variance in later growth
outcomes,anotherreasonforfocusingonearlydevelopment.38
There are limitations to this study. First, the INSIGHT
sample was fairly homogeneous, with limited minority par-
ticipation. The study population was recruited from a single
hospital with English-speaking mothers who, as a group, were
well educated, and findings cannot be generalized to other
populations. However, INSIGHT extends our previous work14
by including women intending to formula feed and women
intending to breastfeed. Second, because only first-time
motherswererecruited,itisunclearhoweffectivetheINSIGHT
RP intervention would be for multiparous mothers. How-
ever, first-born infants are at increased risk of developing
obesity39 and symptoms of metabolic syndrome40 compared
with their younger siblings.
Conclusions
The results of this study suggest that a multicomponent
intervention promoting responsive parenting behaviors can
be efficacious, promoting healthy growth trajectories in
infancy that can reduce obesity risk. These findings, in com-
bination with those of other trials,14,33,34 reveal that inter-
ventions beginning early in infancy can have effects on
growth and weight status, preventing rapid infant weight
gain by providing RP guidance for first-time mothers.
Future analyses will examine whether the INSIGHT RP
intervention results in differences in parenting behaviors
and in infant sleep, feeding, and emotion regulation, which
may mediate effects on weight outcomes. We will continue
to follow these infants longitudinally to examine the longer-
term effects of the INSIGHT RP intervention on BMI at age 3
years and older.

Correction: There were errors in the Discussion
section, the Conclusions section, and in the legend
of Figure 3. In the first sentence of the second
paragraph of the Discussion section, “Nourishing
Our Understanding of Role-modeling to Increase
Support and Health”should be replaced with
“NOURISH-RCT.”In the third sentence of the fourth
paragraph of the Discussion section, “with the
exception of NOURISH34”should be deleted. In the
second sentence of the Conclusions section,
reference 34 should be added following references
14 and 33. Finally, the legend of Figure 3 should be
replaced with the following: “Infants in the
responsive parenting group have lower weight-for-
length percentiles at age 1 year compared with
control group infants (ANOVA P = .04). Among
responsive parenting group infants, 5.5% were
overweight at age 1 year compared with 12.7% of
