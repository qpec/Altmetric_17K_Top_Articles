IMPORTANCE Bariatric surgery is an effective and safe approach for weight loss and
short-term improvement in metabolic disorders such as diabetes. However, studies have
been limited in most settings by lack of a nonsurgical group, losses to follow-up, missing data,
and small sample sizes in clinical trials and observational studies.
OBJECTIVE To assess the association of 3 common types of bariatric surgery compared with
nonsurgical treatment with mortality and other clinical outcomes among obese patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study in a large Israeli integrated
health fund covering 54% of Israeli citizens with less than 1% turnover of members annually.
Obese adult patients who underwent bariatric surgery between January 1, 2005, and
December 31, 2014, were selected and compared with obese nonsurgical patients matched
on age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes, with a final follow-up date of December 31,
2015. A total of 33 540 patients were included in this study.
EXPOSURES Bariatric surgery (laparoscopic banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or laparoscopic
sleeve gastrectomy) or usual care obesity management only (provided by a primary care
physician and which may include dietary counseling and behavior modification).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome, all-cause mortality, matched and
adjusted for BMI prior to surgery, age, sex, socioeconomic status, diabetes, hyperlipidemia,
hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and smoking.
RESULTS Thestudypopulationincluded8385patientswhounderwentbariatricsurgery(median

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among obese patients in a large integrated health fund in
Israel, bariatric surgery using laparoscopic banding, gastric bypass, or laparoscopic sleeve
gastrectomy, compared with usual care nonsurgical obesity management, was associated
with lower all-cause mortality over a median follow-up of approximately 4.5 years. The
evidence of this association adds to the limited literature describing beneficial outcomes of
these 3 types of bariatric surgery compared with usual care obesity management alone.

 A
lthough much is known about short-term outcomes af-
ter bariatric surgery,1,2 relatively little is known about
the long-term effects of these operations.3 Several re-
views have reported long-term results on weight loss and dia-
betes control,4,5 and a recent study demonstrated beneficial,
long-term effects for gastric bypass but was limited by a fairly
homogeneous population and operations that were per-
formed by only a few surgeons.2,6 A large (2500 patients) ret-
rospective cohort study from the US Veterans Affairs system7
of patients who underwent bariatric procedures (74% gastric
bypass,10%laparoscopicbanding,and15%laparoscopicsleeve
gastrectomy) showed reduced mortality attributable to bar-
iatric surgery. That study’
s generalizability was also limited be-
cause the patients were mostly men; in the general popula-
tion, this surgery is performed more often on women.
Obesity is a chronic disease and to fully understand the ef-
fectsofitstreatments,outcomesneedtobeassessedinthelong
term. Although there is a large body of bariatric surgical lit-
erature,thevastmajorityofstudiesreportveryshort-termout-
comes. Consequently, there is a need for more information
about bariatric surgery outcomes. Additionally, most of the
available long-term outcome data focuses on 1 of 2 outdated
procedures: vertical band gastroplasty or laparoscopic band-
ing, or gastric bypass. Recently, sleeve gastrectomy has be-
come a very popular approach for surgically induced weight
loss. Very little is known about the long-term outcomes for
sleeve gastrectomy.1,3,8
The main objective of the present study was to evaluate
the association between 3 common bariatric operations and
all-cause mortality as compared with matched obese pa-
tients who did not undergo surgery. A secondary objective was
to evaluate long-term complications from these surgical pro-
cedures and also to observe the association of bariatric sur-
gery on various metabolic conditions such as diabetes, hyper-
lipidemia, and hypertension.
Methods
Study Design Overview
This is a retrospective cohort study of patients from Clalit
Health Service who underwent bariatric surgery between
January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2014. The index date was
defined as the date of first bariatric surgery. The surgical pa-
tients were matched with obese nonsurgical patients who re-
ceived only usual care obesity management. Usual care obe-
sitymanagementwasprovidedbyprimarycarephysiciansand
may have included dietary counseling and behavior modifi-
cation. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were
gathered for each surgical patient and each matched patient
using extensive data from the Clalit Health Service electronic
health record data system during the 3 years prior to the in-
dex date. The follow-up period was the time between the in-
dex date until occurrence of an event (all-cause mortality, oc-
currence of bariatric surgery among the matched comparison
patients, or end of study follow-up period set as December 31,
2015) to allow at least a minimum follow-up of 1 year for all
participants (eFigure in the Supplement).
This study was approved by the institutional review board
of Clalit Health Service. Individual patient consent was not re-
quired because the study used only existing medical records
data and individual patient identities were masked.
Source Population
In Israel, all citizens are entitled to free, basic health care from
any of the 4 integrated payer-provider health funds. Clalit
Health Service covers and provides care for more than half of
the Israeli population (approximately 4.4 million insured pa-
tient members) who are older than 21 years of age. The ethnic
composition of the membership includes approximately
20% Arab patients, with the remainder being the Jewish popu-
lation with origins from Europe (approximately 60%) and
North Africa or Asia (approximately 40%).
In contrast to health maintenance organizations and
health insurance plans in the United States, Clalit Health Ser-
vice and the other Israeli health funds are characterized by
extremely low annual turnover of approximately 1%, facilitat-
ing nearly complete patient follow-up to study medium- to
long-term outcomes for all 3 types of bariatric surgery.
Study Population
Members were considered potential bariatric surgery patients
if they met all the following inclusion criteria: documentation
of bariatric surgery during the study period, 24 years or older
on the index date (to avoid absence of data during mandatory
militaryserviceinIsrael),andcontinuousmembershipinClalit
Health Service during the baseline period. Surgical and non-
surgical patients were excluded from the study if they met 1 or
more of the following criteria: missing body mass index (BMI;
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared)measurementduringthebaselineperiod,BMIofequal
to or less than 30 in all BMI measurements during the baseline
period, pregnancy during 4 years prior to index date, or docu-
mentation of severe comorbidities during the baseline period
(active cancer, Crohn disease, end-stage renal disease, or asci-
tes). Additional information about the study population is in
eMethods 1 in the Supplement.
For each bariatric surgery patient, 3 matched nonsurgical
patientswereselectedaccordingtoagegroupstratifiedby5-year
intervals, sex, BMI group stratified from greater than 30 to
greater than 50 in 5-unit intervals, and diagnosis of diabetes.
Key Points
Question Is there an association between undergoing bariatric
surgery with laparoscopic banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass,
or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy vs nonsurgical usual care
management and all-cause mortality among patients with obesity?
Findings In this retrospective cohort study of 8385 patients who
underwent bariatric surgery and 25 155 matched patients who
received usual care, the mortality rate over approximately 4.5
years was 1.3% among surgical patients compared with 2.3%
among nonsurgical patients, a significant difference.
Meaning Bariatric surgery was associated with reduced
all-cause mortality.

 Because these characteristics as well as bariatric surgery sta-
tus for the nonsurgical patients may change over time, a se-
quential/simultaneous (time-dependent) stratification match-
ing,whichpreservesthetime-dependentprospectivestructure,
was used.7,9 Nonsurgical patients were considered as potential

domizedclinicaltrial,potentialmatcheswereselectedirrespec-
tive of their future bariatric surgery status; therefore, surgical
patients were considered potential matches for those who un-
derwent bariatric surgery prior to their own surgery. Nonsur-
gical matched patients at index date, who subsequently (after
matching) underwent a bariatric surgical procedure, were cen-
sored at the time of their surgery from the nonsurgical group
and were not added to the surgical group. Potential nonsurgi-
calmatchesmetthesameinclusionandexclusioncriteriaasthe
surgical patients as of index date. Within each set of potential
matches, 3 nonsurgical patients, who had not already been
matched with a surgical patient, were selected randomly. Sur-
gical patients for whom suitable matches were not found were
excluded(Figure1).Eachpatientwhohadrepeatprocedureswas
classified according to his or her initial surgery type.
Baseline Measurements as of Index Date
Surgical data included the type and date of the procedure.
Three types of bariatric procedures were identified—
laparoscopicbanding,gastricbypass,andsleevegastrectomy—
based on first indication of the relevant International Classi-
fication of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code in the Clalit
Health Service data warehouse during 2005-2014. BMI value
as of index date was determined based on the last documen-
tation in the primary care clinics during the 3 years prior
to index date. Socioeconomic variables measured at index
date included age, biological sex, population sector (Jewish,
non-Jewish), immigrant status (immigrated to Israel or born
in Israel), and socioeconomic status (SES; low, medium, high).
Population sector and SES are available and can be deter-
mined only at the clinic level in accordance with the designa-
tion of each member’
s primary care clinic based on census des-
ignations from the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics.
Comorbidity variables were evaluated as of the index date
based on any documentation prior to index date and in-
cluded diabetes (based on a reported algorithm that incorpo-
rates relevant ICD-9 diagnostic codes, HbA1c concentration,
glucose levels, and diabetes medications10), diagnosis of hy-
perlipidemia, diagnosis of hypertension, diagnosis of cardio-
vascular disease (myocardial infarction, unstable angina pec-
toris, angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft, stable angina,
and ischemic stroke), and diagnosis of lower leg amputation.
Medical diagnoses as of index date were primarily defined
based on ICD-9 codes extracted from hospital discharge rec-
ords or ambulatory medical records. Ambulatory records miss-
ing ICD-9 codes were identified by analyzing available writ-
ten text. ICD-9 codes of the medical diagnoses are described
in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Smoking status (current, for-
mer, or nonsmoker as reported by the patient) and laboratory
tests were evaluated based on last documentation in the out-
patient setting during the baseline period. Laboratory tests in-
cluded HbA1c concentration (%), blood glucose concentra-
tion (mg/dL), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyc-
erides. Medication use was assessed through Clalit Health Ser-
vice records of prescriptions filled as coded in the Anatomi-
cal Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system.
Medicationusewasbasedonatleast1purchaseduringtheyear

diovascular system drugs (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Medi-
cations are significantly subsidized by the Clalit Health Ser-
vice,therefore,thesedataareconsideredtobehighlyaccurate.
Outcomes
All-cause mortality (yes or no) during the follow-up period was
the primary outcome. Information regarding mortality events
was obtained from Ministry of Interior data which includes

lation. Cause of death was not available.
Secondary outcomes included additional clinical out-
comes, and complications were reported for each individual
throughtheendofthefollow-upperiod(whichvariedinlength
across individuals) and included: change in BMI (based on last
recorded BMI value during the follow-up period), new diag-
nosis of diabetes, remission of diabetes (last recorded HbA1c
concentration equal to or less than 6% during the last year of
follow-up and no diabetes medications were prescribed dur-
ing the same time period), new diagnosis of hypertension, new
diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, major adverse cardiovascular
events ( defined as myocardial infarction, unstable angina pec-
toris, or coronary artery bypass graft), laboratory test values
associated with nutritional status (hemoglobin and albumin
concentrations [mmol/mol], both defined as the last measure-
ments taken during the follow-up period), use of cardiometa-
bolic medications (including β-blocking agents, calcium chan-
nel blockers, agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system,
lipid-modifying agents, oral hypoglycemics, and insulin or
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists drugs, each de-
fined as a patient being prescribed ≥1 type of the medication
in the last year of follow-up).
Additional outcomes included hospital admissions at least
30 days after index date (in total and for hypoglycemia spe-
cifically), bariatric reoperations (performed ≥30 days after the
first operation; taken from the hospital records and financial
payment data), and nonbariatric reoperations (intestinal ob-
struction, hernia of abdominal cavity, gastric ulcer, and esoph-
ageal stricture recorded during the follow-up period and taken
from the hospital discharge summaries). ICD-9 codes of the
medical diagnoses are described in eTable 1 (in the Supple-
ment). ATC classification codes are listed in eTable 2 (in the

not available once patients left Clalit Health Service.
Statistical Analysis

mortalitybariatricsurgicaloutcomes,stratifiedbysurgerytype
andtheadditionalclinicaloutcomes,weredescribedusingpro-
portions for categorical variables and means with standard de-
viations (SDs) or medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) for
continuousvariables.Differencesbetweensurgicalpatientsand
their matched nonsurgical patients were evaluated using the
unpaired t test and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous vari-
ables and the χ2 test for categorical variables. The statistically
significant threshold of P value less than .05 and 2-sided tests
were used throughout. A large number of additional clinical
outcomes were described as exploratory results, without mul-
tivariable analysis or adjustments, in addition to the primary
mortalityanalysis.Clinicallyimprobablelaboratoryvalueswere
removed (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
We evaluated the association between bariatric surgery
and all-cause mortality using a Kaplan-Meier nonparametric
model comparing groups. The log-rank test (using R package
survival) was used to determine differences in the survival dis-
tribution between surgical patients and nonsurgical patients
(separately for the different types of bariatric surgery).
Stratified Cox proportional hazards regression using mul-
tiple matched pairs (3:1) was used to assess the hazard ratio
(HR) and 95% CI for the association between exposure to bar-
iatric surgery and all-cause mortality, using both unadjusted
and adjusted models. In addition to the variables included in
the matching (age group, sex, BMI group, and diagnosis of dia-
betes), the following potential confounders were included in
the adjusted model: age (continuous), SES, population sec-
tor, immigrant status, diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, diagnosis
of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, smoking status, level
of BMI (continuous), total cholesterol, high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol, and triglycerides.
Termination of follow-up was defined as death, end of
studyperiod,orundergoingbariatricsurgery(amongmatches).
Post hoc, to assess if mortality differed by surgery type, an in-
teraction term (surgery type [laparoscopic banding, gastric by-
pass, and sleeve gastrectomy] × surgical status [y/n]) was in-
corporated into the adjusted stratified Cox regression model.
Missing data of patient characteristics were imputed using
the R package MICE version 2.22 applying chained equa-
tions. Information about the multiple imputation procedures
is located in eMethods 2 (in the Supplement).
For all stratified Cox proportional hazards regression cal-
culations, model assumptions were tested by modeling re-
siduals as well as by graphical observation of the dependence
of coefficients on time. We used R version 3.4.0 64-bit for
all analyses.11
Results
During the study period, there were 15 335 members, aged 24
or older, with documentation of a first bariatric surgery pro-
cedure and with continuous membership in Clalit Health Ser-
vice during the baseline period. Of these, 4119 (26.9%) were
excluded due to uncertainty regarding BMI value or any docu-
mentation of cancer, Crohn’
s disease, ulcerative enterocoli-
tis, end-stage renal disease, or ascites during the baseline pe-
riod, resulting in 11 216 surgical patients (4419 underwent
laparoscopic banding, 1797 underwent gastric banding, and
5000 underwent sleeve gastrectomy) remaining. The at-
tempt to match 3 nonsurgical patients for each bariatric sur-
gery patient failed for 1088 patients due to absence of non-
surgical patients with congruent age, sex, BMI, or diagnosis of
diabetes. These 1088 patients were younger, more obese, less
likelytohavetype2diabetesandmorelikelytobewomenthan
the final surgical cohort. A comparison between surgical pa-
tients who were included in the study and those who were ex-
cluded due to failure in the matching process is described in
eTable 4 (in the Supplement). In addition, 1743 patients who
underwent bariatric surgery were initially selected as nonsur-
gical matches prior to their own surgery.
The final study cohort consisted of 33 540 patients of
whom 8385 were surgical (laparoscopic banding [n=3635], gas-
tric bypass [n=1388], sleeve gastrectomy [n=3362]), and 25 155
nonsurgical matching patients (Figure 1). Main characteris-
tics of the total study cohort, stratified by surgery type, are de-
scribed in Table 1. Missing values of baseline characteristics

Trends in type of surgery performed changed over time.
Apreponderanceoflaparoscopicbandingprocedureswasseen
early in the study period, while sleeve gastrectomy proce-
dures were introduced in 2010. Beginning in 2011, the major-
ity of surgeries were for sleeve gastrectomy (Figure 2).
Of the total study cohort, 30 759 (91.7%) individuals com-
pletedtheirrespectivefollow-upperiod.Oftheremainder,688
(2.1%) died and 2093 (6.2%) nonsurgical patients, who under-
went bariatric surgery during follow-up (of whom 1743 up to
2014), were censored before December 31, 2015. For the main
outcome, receipt of information from the Ministry of Interior
ensured 100% follow-up. For secondary outcomes, 1089 pa-
tients left Clalit Health Service, yielding an overall retention
rate of 96.8%. Median follow-up was 4.3 years (IQR, 2.8-6.6)
for surgical patients and 4.0 years (IQR, 2.6-6.2) for nonsur-
gical patients as described in Table 1. Detailed description of
duration of follow-up by surgery type is provided in Table 1.
Given the later introduction of the sleeve gastrectomy proce-
dure in this cohort, median follow-up is shorter in this group
compared with gastric bypass and laparoscopic banding.
Primary Outcome: Association Between Bariatric Surgery
and Mortality
Table 2 shows that during the follow-up period, there were 688
(2.1%) deaths among the entire cohort, with 105 (1.3%) among
surgical patients (61 [1.7%] laparoscopic banding, 18 [1.3%] gas-
tric bypass, and 26 [0.8%] sleeve gastrectomy) and 583 (2.3%)
among the nonsurgical patients. The median time to mortal-
ity was 3.7 years among patients who died. The absolute mor-
tality rate difference per 1000 person-years, comparing over-
all surgical vs medical group, was 2.51 (95% CI, 1.86-3.15) for
theentirestudypopulation(forlaparoscopicbanding,2.6[95%
CI, 1.7-3.5]; for gastric bypass, 3.4 [95% CI, 1.7-5.0]; and for
sleeve gastrectomy, 1.8 [95% CI, 0.6-3.0]).
Kaplan-Meier nonparametric models comparing groups
demonstrated significant differences in the survival distribu-
tion between nonsurgical patients and surgical patients, with
a higher mortality rate among nonsurgical patients (Figure 3).
After adjustment for patient characteristics, comorbidi-
ties,laboratorytests,anduseofmedications,stratifiedCoxpro-
portional hazards models over the full follow-up period dem-
onstrated significant associations between bariatric surgery
status and all-cause mortality, with higher risk among non-
surgical patients vs those who underwent bariatric surgery for
all 3 types (overall HR, 2.02 [95% CI, 1.63-2.52]; laparoscopic
banding HR, 2.01 [95% CI, 1.50-2.69]; gastric bypass HR, 2.65
[95% CI, 1.55-4.52]; and sleeve gastrectomy HR, 1.60, [95% CI,
1.02-2.51]). These results were consistent with the unad-
justed and the nonimputed models (Table 2).
Introduction of multiplicative interaction terms of surgi-
cal status × surgery type were not statistically significant for
either the preimputed model (P = .52) or the postimputed
model (P = .45). Because all the Cox models described previ-
ously met the proportional hazards assumption, these inter-
action P values suggest that the survival association of sur-
gery was not statistically significantly different across the 3
surgery types.
Secondary Outcomes: Additional Clinical Outcomes
and Complications
Table 3 shows secondary analyses comparing surgical pa-
tients with nonsurgical patients on additional clinical out-
comes at last follow-up included greater BMI unit reduction
in surgical patients (mean [SD], 9.3 [5.8] compared with 1.2
[6.1]), higher proportion of individuals with 20% or more re-
duction in BMI (59.3% compared with 7.6%), lower rates of in-
cident diabetes (0.2% compared with 2.1%), higher rate of dia-
betes remission (23.6% compared with 5.1%), and lower rates
of new hypertension diagnoses (3.2% compared with 8.1%).
Incident rates for major adverse cardiovascular events, hemo-
globin or albumin concentrations, total hospital admissions,
and specific admissions for hypoglycemia were comparable in
the surgical and nonsurgical groups. Reoperations occurred in
8.0% of the laparoscopic band patients, 1.6% of gastric by-
pass patients, and 1.6% of sleeve gastrectomy patients. In total,
surgical patients had more nonbariatric reoperations com-
pared with nonsurgical patients. A detailed breakdown by spe-
cific surgical procedures is given in Table 3.

 Discussion
In this retrospective cohort study in a large integrated health
system, patients who underwent any of the 3 common types
of bariatric surgery experienced statistically significantly
lower rates of all-cause mortality during up to 11 years of
follow-up compared with nonsurgical patients. Duration
of follow-up for sleeve gastrectomy was shorter than for the
other 2 types; however, the study included large numbers of
sleeve gastrectomy patients and there was lower mortality
for these patients as well. Secondary analyses suggest favor-
able patterns for several additional outcomes including
achieved reduction in BMI, remission of diabetes, and reduc-
tion of incident hypertension in surgical patients vs matched
nonsurgical patients.
A major limitation of the previous literature on bariatric
surgery is loss to follow-up in both clinical trials and observa-
tional studies. A meta-analysis by Zhou et al included 7 ran-
domized studies, of which no definitive conclusions could be
made regarding a mortality benefit from bariatric surgery due
to short follow-up times and low numbers of events. Pooled
unadjusted estimates, in the same meta-analysis, from 19
nonrandomized studies of all-cause mortality showed statis-
tically lower all-cause mortality among surgical patients
(4.4%) compared with nonsurgical patients (8.5%).12 Based
on the follow-up period and number of events reported in
that meta-analysis, one can estimate a mean follow up
among the 19 nonrandomized studies of 3.6 years and a mor-
tality rate of 6.4 per 1000 person-years among surgical
patients compared with 22.2 per 1000 person-years among
nonsurgical patients. Unfortunately, most of these studies
lacked methodological rigor and often could not account for
relatively high loss to follow-up. Uncertainty regarding
patients lost to follow-up tempers any conclusions from
studies with poor follow-up because it is conceivable that
these patients had poor outcomes, biasing reports from these
cohorts toward more favorable results.
In a major study from the VA system,7 most of the pa-
tients underwent gastric bypass (74%) with relatively few pa-
tients having laparoscopic banding (10%) or sleeve gastrec-
tomyprocedures(15%).Theirstudyislimitedby75%follow-up
rate at 4 years and a predominance of men (75%).
The current study addresses some of the previous limita-
tions of other studies and thus provides additional data
regarding the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery on all-
cause mortality for the 3 types of bariatric surgery widely
used in the United States, Israel, and world-wide. The study
includes a large number of men and women, large numbers
of the 3 main types of surgery, and nearly complete follow-up
for total mortality. The base study population includes more
than 50% of the entire Israeli citizenry, and thus, the results
are expected to be highly representative of the experience of
the entire country.
Several additional clinical outcomes in surgical and
matched nonsurgical patients were also assessed to provide a
more complete overview of the benefits and risks of different
approachestoobesitytreatmentinthispopulation.Thesewere

 considered secondary analyses, are exploratory, and were not
subjected to any analysis. The results are suggestive of ben-
efit associated with surgery for these additional clinical out-
comes (Table 3).
Some important additional observations are that hemo-
globin levels were not affected, and there was little evidence
of malnutrition or greater incidence of admissions for hypo-
glycemia in the gastric bypass group. This operation is com-
monly associated with anemia, malnutrition, and hypogly-
cemia, but little is known about how often this becomes
a clinically important phenomenon. These observations are
important because of the paucity of data regarding these
long-term complications for the gastric bypass procedure
and will have to be further assessed.
Specific mention should be made regarding bariatric and
nonbariatric reoperations. Most of the bariatric reoperations
occurred in patients who had laparoscopic banding as their
primary operation, and these high reoperation rates have

 resulted in fewer laparoscopic banding procedures being per-
formed. As expected, there were fewer procedures for repair
of abdominal hernias in the nonsurgical group.
This study has several strengths, including large num-
bers of both surgical and nonsurgical patients, high availabil-
ity of follow-up data within the health care system, and the
extensive and robust nature of the available data.
This study also has several limitations. The first is the ob-
servational nature of the study and the need to retrospec-
tively match surgical patients with similar nonsurgical pa-
tients as opposed to random allocation. Matching was
performed with respect to age, sex, BMI, and diagnosis of dia-
betes. Although matching by additional characteristics or pos-
sible use of propensity score matching could have reduced
groupimbalance,itwouldhavecausedconsiderablelossofun-
matched cases. There was a higher proportion of low SES
among nonsurgical patients after matching. Given the higher
mortality among low SES patients in general, SES could have
beenaconfounder.Thisandotherpotentialconfoundingchar-
acteristics were adjusted for in the models.
Second, in an observational study, values may be entered
in a less than rigorous fashion. Although this limitation is
acknowledged, the observational nature of the study allows
us to report medium- to long-term follow-up and outcomes as
applied to a real-world setting. Third, many surgical patients
were excluded from the study due to limited baseline BMI or
matching failure, with differences between the matched and
the unmatched patients.
Fourth, because the different procedures were per-
formed at varying points in time, the present study com-
pared their respective mortality rates but should not be inter-
preted as a head-to-head comparison of the 3 methodologies.
Conclusions
Among obese patients in a large integrated health fund in
Israel, bariatric surgery using laparoscopic banding, gastric by-
pass, or sleeve gastrectomy, vs usual care nonsurgical obesity
management, was associated with lower all-cause mortality
over a median follow-up of approximately 4.5 years. The evi-
dence of this association adds to the limited literature describ-
ing beneficial outcomes of these 3 types of bariatric surgery
compared with usual care obesity management.
