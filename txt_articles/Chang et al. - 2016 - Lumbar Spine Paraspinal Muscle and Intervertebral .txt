Abstract
Study Design—Prospective case series
Objective—Evaluate lumbar paraspinal muscle (PSM) cross-sectional area and intervertebral 
disc (IVD) height changes induced by a 6-month space mission on the International Space Station 
(ISS). The long-term objective of this project is to promote spine health and prevent spinal injury 
during space missions as well as here on Earth.
Summary of Background—NASA crewmembers have a 4.3 times higher risk of herniated 
IVDs, compared to the general and military aviator populations. The highest risk occurs during the 
first year after a mission. Microgravity exposure during long-duration spaceflights results in ~5cm 
lengthening of body height, spinal pain, and skeletal deconditioning. How the PSMs and IVDs 
respond during spaceflight is not well described.
Methods—Six NASA crewmembers were imaged supine with a 3T MRI. Imaging was 
conducted pre-flight, immediately post-flight and then 33 to 67 days after landing. Functional 
cross-sectional area (FCSA) measurements of the PSMs were performed at the L3-4 level. FCSA 
was measured by grayscale thresholding within the posterior lumbar extensors to isolate lean 
muscle on T2-weighted scans. IVD heights were measured at the anterior, middle and posterior 
sections of all lumbar levels. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine significance at 
p<0.05, followed by post-hoc testing.
Results—Paraspinal lean muscle mass, as indicated by the FCSA, decreased from 86% of the 
total PSM cross-sectional area down to 72%, immediately after the mission. Recovery of 68% of

 the post-flight loss occurred over the next 6 weeks, still leaving a significantly lower lean muscle 
fractional content compared to pre-flight values. In contrast, lumbar IVD heights were not 
appreciably different at any time point.
Conclusions—The data reveal lumbar spine PSM atrophy after long-duration spaceflight. Some 
FCSA recovery was seen with 46 days post-flight in a terrestrial environment, but it remained 
incomplete compared to pre-flight levels.

Introduction
The lumbar paraspinal muscles provide postural stability, enabling gait and supporting upper 
extremity movements 1,2. They are critical to function in a gravitational environment. In 
particular, these muscles facilitate vertebral motion, and protect articular structures, discs 
and ligaments from excessive strain and injury 3. Atrophy of these muscles is evidenced by 
altered fat content, cross-sectional area, and higher proportions of type II fast-twitch 
fibers 4,5, and is strongly associated with low back pain on Earth 6,7. However, how these 
muscles function and respond during space flight is not well described.
With microgravity exposure in space, several spine-related issues are observed among 
crewmembers 8. The torso lengthens 4 to 6 cm, about 2 to 3 times the normal diurnal 
increase (1 to 2 cm) on Earth 9,10. This reportedly occurs because of spinal unloading, 
flattening of spinal curvature, loss of paravertebral muscle tone and vertebral disc 
degeneration 11,12. Flight medical data indicate that over half of U.S. astronauts report spine 
pain during their mission 13–15. While in space, astronauts report that a lumbar flexed, “fetal 
tuck” position to stretch is the most effective way of alleviating back pain 14. The back pain 
is described with a moderate to severe level of intensity for 14 to 28% percent of the U.S. 
astronauts. Shuttle crewmembers described pain lasting for 15 to 100% of their mission. The 
location of pain is reported most frequently in the following anatomic regions: 50% low 
back, 11% mid-back, 11% neck and 1% chest. Even after their return to Earth, ~40% of 
crewmembers report spine pain 16. Another indication of lumbar pain is vertebral 
hypomobility from guarding 17, and preliminary data indicate such spinal stiffness is seen 
with prolonged space flight 18,19.
Even with an exercise protocol in place during prolonged space missions, significantly 
decreased muscle size is seen at multiple sites in the body, including the lumbar 
paraspinals 20. The exercise protocols have evolved over time, but traditionally they have not 
specifically focused on core strengthening 21. LeBlanc and co-workers describe an 
exponential recovery of pre-flight muscle size after Mir missions, and the recovery is 
complete within 30 to 60 days. These measurements were made by manually tracing the 
outline of muscle cross-sections seen on 1.5T MR images of 16 crew members. It is 
unknown if fatty replacement, fluid redistribution, or actual lean muscle mass changes occur, 
such as observed in patients or ground-based bed rest simulations of microgravity 22,23.

 Lastly, a concerning risk of intervertebral disc herniation is seen post-flight. The incidence 
of herniated nucleus pulposus is reported as 4.3 times higher in the U.S. astronaut corps 
compared to matched aviator control populations on Earth 11. The highest risk period for 
disc herniation appears in the first year after return to Earth, with the majority reported 
within the first month of landing. It is unknown how medical staff surveillance of the 
astronauts versus control populations, and different behavioral decisions regarding medical 
care seeking and reporting by crewmembers before versus after a mission might play into 
the observations. However, it does strongly suggest that structural changes in the spine 
associated with space adaptation result in deleterious effects occurring with the re-
introduction of the gravity environment. Moreover, the consequence of disc herniation may 
impact an astronaut’s ability to return to work on Earth or conduct work upon arriving at a 
planetary destination such as Mars after a long space flight.
The immediate purpose of this research is to evaluate lumbar paraspinal muscle (PSM) 
cross-sectional area (CSA) and intervertebral disc (IVD) heights following a 6-month 
International Space Station (ISS) mission and a 33 to 67 day post-flight recovery period. The 
goals are to understand the factors involved in lumbar spine strength and back pain in 
crewmembers during a long mission and after increased g-loads of landing and re-adaptation 
to Earth. This could provide helpful physiological information to support a manned mission 
to Mars. On Earth, this information could help our understanding of spinal atrophy and 
degeneration due to inactivity, and potential issues involved with backpack use of military 
personnel, and first-responders.
Materials and Methods
Institutional Research Board approval was obtained from the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA) and the University of California, San Diego. Six ISS 
crewmembers volunteered for the study, 1female and 5 males. The range of crewmember 
ages spanned 46–55 years, height 168–183 cm, and body mass 60–93 kg. The mission 
duration on the ISS ranged from 117–213 days. This project represents four years of active 
data collection, through 2016.
Supine lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted pre-flight, 
immediate post-flight and at least 30 days post-flight recovery after an ISS mission (Figure 
1). Imaging took about 80 minutes, and was performed in the morning, using a Siemens 
Magnetom Verio 3T system at a University of Texas Medical Branch facility outside 
Houston, TX. Pre-flight imaging was performed on average 214 days prior to launch. While 
on the ISS, the astronauts engaged in 2–3 hours of daily exercise with a treadmill, stationary 
cycle and resistive strength training of the large muscle groups 21,24–26. After landing in 
Kazakhstan, the “Immediate” post-flight imaging was performed within 1–2 days, in 
Houston. Landing details are described elsewhere 27. The astronauts completed typical post-
flight astronaut strength, conditioning and rehabilitation (ASCR) exercise and activities 26, 
including a brief trip back to Russia, and return to Houston, TX where they were imaged 
again. These “Recovery” period images were performed an average of 46 days (range 33–67 
days) after landing. The imaging time points are summarized in Table 1.

 Functional cross-sectional area (FCSA) measurements of the lumbar paraspinal muscles 
were obtained using the T2-weighted MRI scans. We elected to focus on the L3/4 vertebral 
level, based on the relative ease of identifying muscle boundaries as compared to lower 
vertebral levels. The FCSA measurements involved an image-analysis thresholding 
technique to estimate lean muscle mass. The technique details are reported elsewhere 1,28–31. 
Briefly, the lumbar paraspinal muscles (multifidus, erector spinae, quadratus lumborum, and 
psoas) were identified and analyzed using Fiji imaging software (National Institutes of 
Health) 32, Figure 2A. Total paraspinal muscle CSA was defined as the sum total of the 
CSAs obtained from the eight PSM (combining right and left). Functional PSM CSA was 
measured using gray-scale thresholding to analyze those regions of the muscle cross-
sections corresponding to dark, lean muscle mass. The analysis was conducted by one 
individual (R.H.). Our control studies showed that repeat measurements done by an 
individual as well as by several individuals were reliable and reproducible, with an intraclass 
correlation coefficient of 0.99, consistent with the literature 28,29. Statistical analysis was 
conducted using one-way, repeated measures ANOVA to establish significance, defined as 
p<0.05, followed by post-hoc testing with the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test 33 
with alpha = 0.05, using GraphPad Prism (version 5.04, GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, 
CA) software.
Lastly, lumbar IVD heights were measured at the anterior, middle and posterior sections 
from the L1-2 to L5-S1 disc levels (Figure 2B). The fast spin echo T2 images were obtained 
at the midsaggital plane 34, with slice thickness 4mm, field of view 200, 192×320 image 
matrix, voxel size 1×0.6×4mm, and NEX 2. For each subject, the disc height at a given 
lumbar intervertebral level was defined as the average of measurements made in the anterior, 
middle and posterior locations along the disc, modified from the Dabbs method 35. Change 
in the average disc height was calculated at post-flight (Post-Preflight), recovery (Recovery-
Postflight), and overall change from pre-flight to recovery (Recovery-Preflight). This 
measurement has an uncertainty with inter- and intra-observer standard deviations of 0.2 and 
0.3mm, respectively 36. Our group has used the technique to measure changes in lumbar 
IVD heights with Earth-bound subjects in unloaded bedrest 34, and loaded backpack 
studies 36,37.
Results
Lumbar paraspinal FCSA decreased by 19% on average from a pre-flight value of 8737 
mm2 ± 1758 mm2 (avg ± sd) down to a post-flight value of 7049 mm2 ± 1822 mm2. Later, 
there was a change in FCSA up to a recovery value of 8195 mm2 ± 1900 mm2. ANOVA 
testing indicates a significant difference in FCSA measured at the three time points, with F 
ratio 23.39, R2 0.82 and p=0.0002. Post hoc testing indicates the FCSA changed 
significantly from pre- to post-flight, and from post-flight to post-flight recovery. The FCSA 
data at the recovery time point were less than the pre-flight values, representing a 68% 
recovery of the post-flight loss, a difference not significantly different as determined by post 
hoc testing. In comparison, the total lumbar paraspinal CSA (that encompass the 
unthresholded manual outlines, and therefore includes both lean muscle and non-lean 
muscle components ) followed a similar trend at the three time points, but with non-
significant changes (F ratio 1.44, R2 0.22, p=0.2832) , Table 2.

 Expressed as a percent of the total lumbar CSA, the relative proportion of lumbar lean 
muscle FCSA decreased from pre-flight to post-flight by 14 percentage points from 86% 
± 5% down to 72 ± 7% . The fraction of lumbar muscle FCSA recovered nine percentage 
points over the next six weeks to an average of 81% ± 4%. ANOVA testing indicates a 
significant difference in percent FCSA measured at the three time points, with F ratio 22.25, 
R2 0.82, and p=0.0002. Post hoc testing indicates the FCSA changed significantly from pre- 
to post-flight, and from post-flight to post-flight recovery. This resulted in a significantly 
lower lean muscle fractional content at recovery compared to the pre-flight values (Figure 
3).
Among the six crewmembers studied, average disc height did not change in the lumbar 
spine. There was no consistent pattern before and after the mission (Table 3). There was 
considerable disc height variability from crewmember to crewmember, over various lumbar 
spine levels, and along anterior-middle-posterior locations of the disc.
Discussion
This study showed reductions in total cross-sectional area with long-duration space flight, 
but even more dramatic reductions in functional cross-sectional area, a proxy for lean 
muscle mass. At six weeks post-mission, the FCSA and CSA trended toward pre-flight 
levels. After the mission, the lumbar paraspinal extensors recovered 68% of the loss after 
~46 days back on Earth. These ISS data are comparable to previous long-duration Mir data 
obtained ~20 years ago 20, where intrinsic back muscle total cross sectional area decreased 
to 84% of pre-flight values, and psoas cross-sectional area decreased to 96%. However 
direct comparisons to that study are difficult to make due to several factors.
We had six crewmembers, whereas LeBlanc and co-workers report on 16 crewmembers. We 
used one 3 Tesla MRI scanner in Houston operated by a single team of technicians, whereas 
LeBlanc et al. used three 1.5 Tesla scanners at two centers (Moscow, Russia and Houston, 
TX). During the missions, different exercise countermeasures were utilized on board more 
recent ISS compared to previous Mir flights 38. On Mir specifically, there were no 
significant resistance exercises for strength. LeBlanc and co-workers report slightly more 
temporal variability for scan times after landing. For example, five of the six crewmembers 
were scanned between day 1–2 after landing in the present study, whereas their first 
postflight measurements occurred on landing day itself or up to four days after landing. We 
focused on the L3/4 lumbar level, whereas LeBlanc and co-workers made muscle volume 
calculations using an unspecified region of the lumbar spine. We elected not to measure the 
lower lumbar levels due to the greater difficulty in identifying clear muscle boundaries in a 
region that typically has a greater degree of fatty atrophy/intermuscular fascial connections 
(e.g. lumbar intermuscular aponeurosis, lumbosacral ligaments) in the multifidi/erector 
spinae muscles, and a fanning/thinning of the psoas and erector spinae muscles as they 
traverse normally away from the lumbar spine 39. Lastly, we evaluated both total and 
functional cross-sectional area measurements. This provides insight into lean-muscle mass 
changes separated from the effects of water retention or fatty replacement.

 In contrast to paraspinal muscle data, individual disc height changes in the lumbar spine 
were small and demonstrated no consistent changes across time points. Specifically, disc 
height increases were not seen in a significant or consistent fashion postflight. We continue 
to review this data in several additional ways, including total lumbar disc height (measured 
by summing disc heights from every level) and total lumbar length between the L1 and the 
L5 vertebral bodies 40, and also by making comparisons with lumbar lordosis measurements, 
MRI T2 water mapping techniques 41 in the discs 19, and a separate data set we collected on 
the subjects using upright standing MRI data 36. So far, our data are compatible to previous 
lumbar disc height and lumbar length measurements after short-duration space flight 40, and 
preliminary data from in-flight ultrasound studies of cervical and lumbar disc heights, which 
also do not indicate significant disc height increases or swelling 42.
These measurements run counter to previous hypotheses about the effects of micro-gravity 
on disc swelling 11,43, and suggest that the torso lengthening observed in crewmembers 12,44 
may be due to factors other than swelling of the intervertebral discs. Specifically, postural 
straightening (i.e. a flattening of spinal lumbar lordosis and thoracic kyphosis into a ‘neutral 
body posture’ in microgravity) is an important factor 12,19. However our sample size is 
presently small for the study of IVD heights, and we have no in-flight images. Further spine 
analysis with additional crewmembers and in-flight ultrasound imaging will be forthcoming.
Back pain is a part of life. About two-thirds of the adult population will experience low back 
pain and a specific pathologic anatomical diagnosis is made in only ~15% of cases 45. Given 
that, what are the implications of lowered paraspinal muscle functional cross-sectional area? 
Back pain patients do demonstrate reduced paraspinal muscle cross-sectional area 7. 
However, the positive predictive value of cross-sectional area on the development of future 
low back pain is controversial, and it has not yet been established as a strong independent 
risk factor 46,47. This may be similar to other reported low back pain risk factors (such as 
physical demands at work, job satisfaction, bodily vibration, smoking, alcohol consumption, 
lumbar flexibility, etc.), where reliable predictive conclusions from the literature are difficult 
to make for any one person due to the many intercorrelated and confounding parameters, 
and the fact low back pain is common even in people without such risks. Back weakness is 
one known risk factor for low back pain 45,48 and our laboratory is analyzing Biering-
Sorensen back extension endurance data to help characterize a structure-function 
relationship among the crewmembers. Even so, muscle endurance and strength depend not 
only on cross-sectional area, but also on many other factors such as muscle contractility, 
metabolism, and fiber type atrophy 49,50, as well as neuromuscular recruitment, 
coordination, and fatigue mechanisms 51,52, pain and psychosocial factors 53.
Astronaut exercise programs currently emphasize the maintenance of bone mineral density, 
aerobic/anerobic capacity, and muscle strength/power (focused on the large muscles of the 
proximal hips and shoulders) and endurance 21. Pre-flight, the exercise program involves a 
mix of cardio aerobic training, functional training for activities performed in daily life, 
resistive weight-training (e.g. squats and deadlifts), and familiarization of in-flight exercises. 
In-mission there is treadmill training, cycle ergometer and resistive training (squats, 
deadlifts, bench/shoulder press, rows). Post-flight there is cardio, resistive weight-training, 
and functional exercise focused on balance, proprioception, agility, coordination and

 power 26. These routinized exercise programs are closely monitored by NASA Astronaut 
Strength, Conditioning and Rehabiliation (ASCR) and medical staff. With such a steady-
state, maintenance program in place pre-flight, we do not believe significant lumbar 
deconditioning or strengthening occurs between the pre-flight images and the flight itself. 
However, we are unable to substantiate this belief because mission logistics preclude testing 
close to the actual launch date.
Our lumbar spine data identify a specific departure from the terrestrial, baseline anatomy of 
astronauts. It further suggests an exercise countermeasure is needed to focus on the lumbar 
paraspinal muscles. Low load, lumbar core stabilization exercises are efficacious for back 
pain patients 54, deconditioned 1,55 and healthy 56 adults on Earth, specifically improving 
paraspinal muscle CSA atrophy and strength 4,57–59, as well as acute 60,61 and 
chronic 57,62,63 low back pain. Such core-strengthening exercises specifically involve 
isometric exercises or lumbar extensor training. Another promising exercise countermeasure 
for low back pain is yoga 64, which might be particularly effective in addressing spaceflight-
associated lumbar stiffness and hypomobility 15,19,65. Existing exercise interventions in 
microgravity that target other muscle groups are effective in addressing atrophy 38. Whether 
new exercise countermeasures can prevent inflight paraspinal muscle atrophy, improve 
spinal pain and function, shorten recovery time and how such exercise might be performed 
in a micro-gravity environment with available exercise equipment need further study.
