AHA SCIENTIFIC STATEMENT
Health Literacy and Cardiovascular 
Disease: Fundamental Relevance to 
Primary and Secondary Prevention
A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
Circulation
http://circ.ahajournals.org
ABSTRACT: Health literacy is the degree to which individuals are able 
to access and process basic health information and services and thereby 
participate in health-related decisions. Limited health literacy is highly 
prevalent in the United States and is strongly associated with patient 
morbidity, mortality, healthcare use, and costs. The objectives of this 
American Heart Association scientific statement are (1) to summarize the 
relevance of health literacy to cardiovascular health; (2) to present the 
adverse associations of health literacy with cardiovascular risk factors, 
conditions, and treatments; (3) to suggest strategies that address barriers 
imposed by limited health literacy on the management and prevention 
of cardiovascular disease; (4) to demonstrate the contributions of health 
literacy to health disparities, given its association with social determinants 
of health; and (5) to propose future directions for how health literacy can 
be integrated into the American Heart Association’s mandate to advance 
cardiovascular treatment and research, thereby improving patient care and 
public health. Inadequate health literacy is a barrier to the American Heart 
Association meeting its 2020 Impact Goals, and this statement articulates 
the rationale to anticipate and address the adverse cardiovascular effects 
associated with health literacy.
H
ealth literacy, the degree to which an individual can access, process, and 
comprehend basic health information and services in order to inform and 
participate in health decisions,1 has a pivotal, decisive role in healthcare 
delivery and outcomes. Limited health literacy is an invisible barrier to healthcare 
delivery that has profound costs for individual and public health. Health literacy has 
been associated with limited knowledge of health conditions2–4 and medications,5 
poorer overall health status,6,7 higher healthcare costs,8,9 and increased likelihood 
of rehospitalization10 and mortality.11–13 Awareness of health literacy, its implica-
tions, and relevance to individual and public health is fundamental to achieving the 
American Heart Association (AHA) 2020 Impact Goals to improve cardiovascular 
health by 20% for all Americans.14 The rationale for this statement is to address the 
relevance of health literacy to cardiovascular disease (CVD) management, preven-
tion, and public health.
The overall objective of this statement is to clarify the central relevance of health 
literacy to cardiovascular health. The Institute of Medicine’s landmark 2004 report 
Health Literacy: A Prescription to End Confusion emphasized that health literacy op-
erates within the “health concept,” recognized as the broad social fabric in which 
institutional, public, and private health occurs.1 Over the course of the past 1 to 2

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
decades, the discourse has progressed: Abundant and 
consistent scholarship has shown that health literacy is 
a barrier to healthcare access, physician-patient commu-
nication, adherence, and effective healthcare use and 
that organizational factors have a major role in easing 
or complicating health for people with limited health 
literacy. Likewise, patient- and family-centered care and 
patient/family engagement have emerged as priorities 
for addressing health literacy. Limited health literacy 
prevents individuals and families from developing the 
knowledge, skills, and confidence necessary to engage 
in their care in an empowered fashion. The effects of lim-
ited health literacy extend beyond the individual health 
encounter, given that health literacy is a shared func-
tion of social, cultural, and individual factors. Therefore, 
it structures opportunities for health and mediates and 
exacerbates disparities in cardiovascular care and treat-
ment. This statement affirms the commitment of the 
authors and the AHA to addressing these challenges.1,15
Programmatic initiatives from the American Medi-
cal Association, the American College of Physicians,16 
and The Joint Commission17 have advocated for incor-
porating health literacy into healthcare delivery and 
services. The Agency for Health Research and Quality 
(AHRQ) has promoted the Universal Precautions Tool-
kit to improve communication and implementation of 
health care.18 The authors of this statement embrace 
the “universal precautions” approach, which advocates 
for standardized communication, accessible at any level 
of health literacy. Understanding health literacy is criti-
cal for delivering health care, developing prevention 
initiatives, and addressing public health. This statement 
appreciates health literacy as systematically permeating 
how patients interact with the medical system, includ-
ing their self-care, activation, and participation in deci-
sion making. Limited health literacy prevents individu-
als and families from developing the knowledge, skills, 
and confidence necessary to engage or participate in 
their care. The summary objective of this statement is 
to clarify the central relevance of health literacy and its 
importance in cardiovascular health and the health of 
the individual, the family, and our society.
The commitment of the AHA to this statement stems 
from the recognition of the widespread prevalence of 
limited health literacy in US adults19; the associations of 
health literacy with increased patient morbidity, mor-
tality, healthcare use, and costs7,8,20; and the increasing 
complexity of understanding and navigating healthcare 
material and documentation provided to patients, in-
cluding the use of electronic patient portals and other 
Internet-based health tools.21
The objectives of this statement are 5-fold. The first 
objective is to inform healthcare professionals’ knowl-
edge of the prevalence of limited health literacy as it re-
lates to cardiovascular health within and across health-
care encounters. Second, the statement establishes the 
importance of health literacy to health care in general 
and CVD treatment and prevention specifically by sum-
marizing the association of health literacy across a spec-
trum of cardiovascular risk factors, diseases, and treat-
ments. Third, this statement describes established and 
promising strategies that mitigate barriers imposed by 
limited health literacy to CVD management and preven-
tion. The fourth objective is to articulate the interface 
of health literacy with social determinants of health and 
thereby demonstrate how limited health literacy per-
petuates health disparities. Finally, this statement sug-
gests future directions for integrating health literacy in 
cardiovascular research and health with the goal of im-
proving patient care and public health initiatives.
METHODS: COMMITTEE 
COMPOSITION AND APPROACH TO 
THE LITERATURE
This statement summarizes contemporary studies rel-
evant to health literacy and CVD and situates health 
literacy as an essential concept for the community of 
AHA researchers, investigators, and practitioners. This 
statement is not a systematic review, given the expan-
sive nature of the topics of health literacy and CVD, nor 
is it a guideline for clinical practice. Rather, the state-
ment is a summary of the contemporary science of CVD 
and health literacy with the purpose of enhancing the 
knowledge and awareness of healthcare professionals. 
The studies presented are a synthesis of the existing 
literature, informed by existing systematic reviews and 
the diverse perspectives of the experts on the writing 
group.22 The 10-member writing group for this state-
ment is diverse in its demographic composition, disci-
plinary perspectives, and context expertise. It consists of 
4 women, includes 2 underrepresented minorities, and 
comprises clinicians (internal medicine, cardiovascular 
physicians, and nurses) and clinician scientists engaged 
in health services research, epidemiology, health educa-
tion, and behavioral health interventions. The commit-
tee is further enhanced by individuals with expertise in 
social determinants of health (including health literacy) 
and cardiovascular health disparities affecting racial/
ethnic minorities and rural populations and the devel-
opment and evaluation of community-based interven-
tions and strategies to promote health.
HEALTH LITERACY: DEFINITIONS AND

Measuring Literacy in the United States
In 1992, the US Department of Education initiated the 
first population-based, in-person assessment of adult 
literacy with the National Adult Literacy Survey.23 The

AND GUIDELINES
survey characterized 46% to 51% of participants as be-
ing in the 2 lowest quintiles of literacy. From this study, 
as many as 90 million Americans ≥16 years old were es-
timated to have significantly limited reading and quan-
titative skills. In 2003, the US Department of Education 
conducted the National Assessment of Adult Literacy 
Survey,24 which specifically included health literacy, in 
contrast to the measurement of general literacy by the 
National Adult Literacy Survey. The National Assess-
ment of Adult Literacy Survey determined that 36% of 
US adults had basic or below-basic health literacy and 
identified significant differences in health literacy across 
sex, age, and race/ethnicity categories.25 Twelve percent 
of women were classified in the lowest literacy category, 
below basic, compared with 16% of men. Older adults 
(categorized as ≥65 years of age) had worse health lit-
eracy than individuals in younger age categories in that 
59% were measured at or below basic health literacy. 
There were substantive racial and ethnic differences: 
9% of non-Hispanic whites had below-basic health lit-
eracy compared with 25% of American Indian/Alaskan 
Native, 24% of non-Hispanic black, and 41% of white 
Hispanic adults. Health literacy was positively correlated 
with educational attainment. Of individuals without a 
high school education, 49% were categorized as hav-
ing below-basic health literacy compared with 3% to 
5% of those with some college education.25
The more contemporary Programme for the Inter-
national Assessment of Adult Competencies surveyed 
>160 
000 adults 16 to 65 years of age in 24 countries 
and subnational regions to assess literacy and numeracy 
in a technology-rich environment. Literacy and numer-
acy levels were ranked from 1, the lowest level, to 5, 
the highest level, across participating countries.26 In the 
United States, 5010 adults participated in the adminis-
tration of the survey in 2011 to 2012. The majority of 
US participants (54.3%) were categorized as having lev-
el 2 or lower literacy. In terms of numeracy proficiency, 
65.6% of participants were classified as having level 2 
or lower proficiency.27 These data indicate the ongoing 
challenge of adult literacy in contemporary US society.
Dimensions of Health Literacy
Continued scholarship in health literacy has broadened 
the definition and constituent components of the topic. 
The definition of health literacy has expanded to en-
compass skills requisite for successful functioning in an 
information-based, electronic society.28 There is a cur-
rent appreciation that health literacy extends beyond 
proficiency in reading, writing, and numeracy and in-
volves interpretation of images, oral communication, 
facility with technology, and social networking.29 Health 
literacy has further been considered fundamental to ab-
stract skills such as evaluating and weighing treatment 
considerations and engaging in medical decision mak-
ing; how patients navigate the electronic, geographic, 
and administrative components of health care; and 
how individuals implement health-related informa-
tion and engage in self-care.30–32 The net result is an 
understanding of health literacy as spanning multiple 
cognitive and social domains that interface with the 
technological and community environments. A content 
analysis identified 11 fundamental, interrelated skills 
that make up and define health literacy.33 These skills 
and their definitions are summarized in Table 1.
Multiple and diverse measures have been imple-
mented for quantifying and characterizing individuals’ 
health literacy. Table 2 summarizes select, widely used 
health literacy measures, their fundamental character-
istics, and the health literacy dimensions assessed by 
the measures. The most recent comprehensive review 
of the dimensions and psychometric properties of the 
measures was published in 2014,34 which at that time 
identified 51 tools for health literacy measurement. 
The tools were characterized as general assessments 
(n=26), disease or condition specific (n=15), or targeted 
to a population (n=10). The Boston University Health 
Literacy Tool Shed maintains a database of health lit-
eracy measures.47 Items are categorized by health lit-
eracy domain, instrument context (such as condition or 
disease), number of items, instrument language, and 
administration time. The database also contains a psy-
chometric evaluation for the various instruments that 
includes the sample size used for validation, cohort age, 
and the measure style as characterized by the predomi-
nant measurement tools for health literacy assessment. 
More than 125 such instruments are now cataloged by 
the Health Literacy Tool Shed.34,47

HEALTH LITERACY AND SOCIAL 
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH
Health literacy extends beyond the clinic- or hospital-
based environment where health care is delivered to 
encompass how individuals approach and navigate 
self-care and health-related experiences. Social deter-
minants of health are defined by the World Health Or-
ganization as “the circumstances in which people are 
born, grow, live, work, and age, and the systems put 
in place to deal with illness.”48 Limited health literacy 
is more prevalent among racial and ethnic minorities, 
older adults, and individuals with less education.19,24 
Likewise, health literacy is strongly related to socioeco-
nomic position, English language proficiency, and the 
development of general literacy.49 The relationship be-
tween health literacy and social determinants of health 
is portrayed in Figure 1. This figure further indicates 
the shared associations among health literacy, social 
determinants, and intermediate and long-term health 
outcomes.
Health literacy may be contextualized in the con-
text of the life course model of risk factors and dis-
ease.50–52 Language is critical for self-expression be-
ginning in infancy and is shaped by early childhood 
exposure to verbal expression, diction, and linguistic 
content in the home and social arenas. Children of 
low-income families experience deficits in language 
exposure and acquisition (described as the “30-mil-
lion-word gap”) from early infancy.53 In addition, pa-

Health Literacy and Cardiovascular Disease
rental health literacy directly affects the preventive 
care that children receive,54,55 having a direct impact 
on both childhood health and orientation toward pre-
ventive health care.56 Children of parents with limited 
literacy have been shown to have worse health out-
comes. At least 1 in 3 adolescents and young adults 
has limited health literacy,54 and children with limited 
literacy tend to exhibit worse health behaviors.57 Old-
er adults have increased risk for limited health literacy 
for multiple reasons that may include social norms 
and expectations about health or decline in cognitive 
function with aging. More important, limited genera-
tional opportunities for education may impair general 
literacy early and throughout life; older adults bear 
the effects of the absence of standardization in edu-
cation and the historical racial segregation of the ed-
ucational environment.52 Educational disenfranchise-
ment in older adults similarly clusters with income 
and socioeconomic position, both correlated with 
health literacy. Thus, health literacy both is related to 
and perpetuates the disparities associated with social 
determinants of health. Figure 2 presents opportuni-
ties for challenges and gains in health literacy across 
the life course.
The Challenge of Limited Health Literacy
Obstacles to optimal health care for people with lim-
ited health literacy occur at multiple levels in healthcare 
delivery.58 First, individuals with limited health literacy 
experience challenges in accessing healthcare services. 
Electronic or paper applications for insurance coverage 
are complex documents that are not designed for indi-
viduals with basic literacy skills. Successfully completing 
such documentation may be challenging. The details of 
insurance coverage and accompanying administrative 
bureaucracy demand a high level of literacy to grasp. 
The Affordable Care Act and its constituent mandates 
were critiqued as challenging for many to understand, 
which may have affected enrollment.59
Figure 2. Health literacy presented as a life course trait.  
Opportunities exist for the enfranchisement or impoverishment of health literacy beginning in infancy and spanning across the life course. Health literacy as 
encountered in adults reflects myriad familial, community and environmental, and educational influences. This statement emphasizes the overall goal as not cor-
recting health literacy challenges in an individual but implementing approaches toward healthcare communication and delivery that are universally accessible.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
Second, as consistently documented by an exten-
sive body of literature, all manner of health-related 
materials exceeds the reading ability of the average 
US adult.1 Educational brochures and instructions 
routinely include technical language and complicat-
ed explanations of pathophysiology or do not include 
comprehensible illustrations, making them hard to 
understand. Despite hundreds of publications about 
the readability of informed consent documents and 
patient education materials, most patients cannot 
read documents intended to empower them. Indi-
viduals with limited health literacy may have less 
access to reliable Internet-based health education 
materials.60–65
A third challenge for individuals with limited health 
literacy stems from physician-patient communica-
tion. Physicians frequently use medical terminology 
in their written and oral communication that exceeds 
the understanding of even highly educated individu-
als.66,67 Overcoming patient-provider communication 
barriers remains challenging, particularly for patients 
with limited health literacy, despite the growing em-
phasis on improving communication skills in medical 
school and resident curricula.68 Furthermore, indi-
viduals with limited health literacy may not ask fun-
damental questions or seek to clarify ambiguity69,70; 
they may have had stigmatizing experiences result-
ing from limited literacy and have shame about their 
level of understanding.71,72 A universal precautions 
approach advocates screening for comprehension of 
the clinical plan and tailoring treatment to enhance 
and verify patient understanding.73,74 Such an ap-
proach mitigates shaming of individuals with limited 
literacy and improves healthcare communication by 
placing responsibility for successful communication 
with the provider.75
Fourth, patients with limited health literacy must use 
oral and written communication, integrate complex 
information, and use numeracy and quantitative skills. 
For example, medication adherence frequently requires 
understanding complex scheduling and dosing details, 
as well as information relating to dietary choices and 
timing, and appropriate vigilance about symptoms and 
side effects.
Finally, language and cultural barriers may interfere 
with healthcare delivery. There is extensive literature on 
health literacy challenges faced by refugees and im-
migrants, in addition to individuals with limited Eng-
lish proficiency.76,77 Such populations are vulnerable to 
poor communication about health-related services.78 
Improved access to language-appropriate services is 
critical. It is also important to understand that overcom-
ing language barriers is simply the first step; mitigating 
health literacy barriers in interpreted encounters is the 
next communication challenge to overcome for safe 
and effective care.
HEALTH LITERACY AND 
CARDIOVASCULAR RISK AND 
OUTCOMES
Health literacy has a prominent role in the primary 
and secondary prevention of CVD. Given the exten-
sive literature, the writing group selected studies that 
emphasize health literacy in addressing CVD risk and 
outcomes. Table 3 provides details on studies selected 
for larger size (n>150, used to focus on larger studies), 
use of validated measurement of health literacy, and 
treatment of health literacy as an independent vari-
able that were published from January 2004 through 
November 2016.
Hypertension and Health Literacy
Health literacy has had robust investigations in hyper-
tension.79–81,112 Health literacy is related to recognition 
and knowledge of hypertension. A cross-sectional study 
of 402 patients from 2 racially diverse and geographi-
cally distinct public, urban healthcare facilities found 
that the majority (55%) of individuals with inadequate 
health literacy were not able to recognize a blood pres-
sure of 160/100 mm 
Hg as abnormal.113 The finding is 
particularly relevant in that knowledge of blood pres-
sure targets has been related to effective management 
of hypertension.114 In urban ambulatory care cohorts, 
individuals with limited health literacy had a 1.8 to 2.7 
times increased risk of not achieving guideline-based 
blood pressure recommendations.80,115 Limited studies 
have examined the effect of patient-centered interven-
tions integrating health literacy on blood pressure con-
trol. A multisite trial (the Heart Healthy Lenoir Study) 
conducted in 6 primary care practices over 24 months 
found that a multilevel intervention improved systolic 
blood pressure among patients across health literacy 
levels.82
Patient-centered interventions have addressed lim-
ited health literacy to improve medication adherence in 
hypertension. Adherence is a complex, multilevel con-
cept; its constructs and the relevance of social determi-
nants of health, including literacy, to medication adher-
ence in patients with hypertension have been evaluated 
by a systematic review and meta-analysis.116,117 The aim 
of such interventions is to address patient misunder-
standing of prescription instructions and unintentional 
misuse of medications to which individuals with limited 
health literacy are particularly vulnerable.118,119 A 2-arm 
multisite trial (n=845) used patient-centered drug la-
beling, recognized by the study team as an inexpen-
sive and simple modification, to improve adherence to 
blood pressure and diabetes mellitus medications. The 
intervention improved adherence in study participants 
with inadequate literacy 4-fold, by self-report, and 
5-fold, by pill count, compared with the standard care

referent cohort.120 A small (n=68) study composed pre-
dominantly of participants with limited health literacy 
identified that aids, such as flashcards and smartphone-
activated videos, improved medication adherence.121 
These strategies indicate that simplified regimen ad-
ministration, use of aids, and multilevel interventions 
can improve blood pressure control in individuals with 
limited health literacy.
There are continued gaps in the investigation of 
health literacy and hypertension. Few studies have 
measured health literacy as a covariate. Inclusion of 
health literacy as a measure in large, prospective, com-
munity-based cohort studies would facilitate exploring 
the prospective short- and long-term effect of health 
literacy on hypertension and blood pressure control. In-
clusion of health literacy measurement in clinical trials 
may provide insight into how health literacy may modi-
fy adherence in a trial, as well as provide an assessment 
of generalizability to individuals with limited health lit-
eracy who are less likely to participate in clinical trials.
In addition, multidisciplinary and multilevel interven-
tions are needed to improve blood pressure control in 
individuals with hypertension and limited health literacy. 
Healthcare providers and health systems should collab-
orate to provide patient materials and to use strategies 
that mitigate the effects of limited health literacy.122 For 
example, strategies that promote patient-provider com-
munication82 and foster patient empowerment may 
improve medication adherence.123 Community-based 
interventions can leverage resources such as neighbor-
hood pharmacies to promote blood pressure screening, 
monitoring, and adherence. Multifaceted interventions 
that incorporate patients, providers, and health systems 
are essential to address health literacy barriers and to 
promote patient empowerment and success with long-
term hypertension management.
Diabetes Mellitus and Health Literacy
Success for the patient with diabetes mellitus requires 
an array of skills integral to health literacy: interactional, 
numeracy, information seeking, application/function, 
decision making, confidence, and navigation. Specific 
components of diabetes mellitus in which health lit-
eracy has been best evaluated are social and cognitive 
factors, including diabetes mellitus knowledge,124 self-
efficacy125,126 or activation,127 and attitudes or beliefs,128 
and self-care,84 spanning the range of activities that re-
late to diabetes mellitus management, including diet, 
physical activity, medication and treatment adherence, 
and problem solving. Health literacy has also been 
linked to outcomes relevant to diabetes mellitus such as 
glucose control and microvascular complications.129,130 
The literature describing these associations between 
health literacy and diabetes mellitus was well evalu-
ated and summarized in 2014 by Bailey et al.131 Limited 
health literacy has been related to decreased access to 
healthcare screening and basic services and therefore 
has been implicated in diabetes mellitus risk.132
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that requires 
consistent health behaviors guided by specific knowl-
edge of the condition and its treatment.128 A system-
atic review identified consistently strong evidence that 
health literacy is associated with diabetes mellitus 
knowledge.130 One study (n=2594) characterized Indi-
ans and Alaskan Natives as having limited social and 
economic resources and identified a strong relation 
between health literacy and diabetes mellitus knowl-
edge that adversely affected dietary behaviors in this 
vulnerable cohort with significant social and economic 
challenges.87 The study authors concluded that diabe-
tes mellitus knowledge is a central component of ad-
dressing diabetes mellitus care in individuals with in-
adequate health literacy. Conversely, decreased health 
literacy in a single-center cohort of individuals (n=280) 
with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin 
A1c levels >8%) was related to poor knowledge; indi-
viduals in the lowest health literacy tertile were 4-fold 
more likely to assert that their diabetes mellitus was 
well controlled, despite a hemoglobin A1c >8.0%, 
than those in the referent tertile.133 The importance of 
health literacy as a parental trait is demonstrated by 
its impact on parents of children with type 1 diabe-
tes mellitus; adults with limited health literacy face the

challenge of knowledge gaps in providing care for their 
children.134,135
Observational studies have related health literacy to 
diverse and varied behaviors that make up diabetes mel-
litus self-care,131 including associations between health 
literacy and adherence to both diabetes mellitus and 
nondiabetes mellitus medication.84,88 Health literacy has 
been demonstrated to mediate the racial disparities in 
adherence to diabetes mellitus medications observed in 
a biracial (black and white; n=398) cohort.136
The electronic patient portal is increasingly used 
to augment self-care in diabetes mellitus and other 
chronic diseases. Analysis of a large health mainte-
nance organization found that members with limited 
health literacy were 1.7 times less likely to use the elec-
tronic patient portal for communication and disease 
management than members with adequate or higher 
health literacy.137 Multiple studies have related health 
literacy to patient engagement, activation, and self-
efficacy,3,138,139 with some demonstration that health 
literacy may facilitate or mediate patient activation 
and diabetes mellitus management.140,141 The range 
of studies indicates the types of health literacy skills 
(Table 1) that are needed for self-care among patients 
with diabetes mellitus.
Evidence about the relation of health literacy and 
glycemic control is mixed, which may be explained by 
variation in how potential confounders are handled 
in analysis. Similarly, health literacy has had varied as-
sociations with cardiovascular risk factors and clinical 
outcomes specific to diabetes mellitus. In a large cross-
sectional study, health literacy was not associated with 
cardiovascular risk factors (systolic and diastolic blood 
pressures and low-density lipoprotein) or self-reported 
complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, CVD) in in-
dividuals with diabetes mellitus.83 However, in an ur-
ban patient cohort, individuals with inadequate health 
literacy had a 2-fold increased risk of retinopathy, as 
determined by self-report and confirmed by adminis-
trative data.129 The committee is not aware of studies 
examining the association of health literacy with adju-
dicated cardiovascular outcomes such as coronary or 
other cardiovascular events in individuals with diabetes 
mellitus. Understanding health literacy and prospective, 
long-term complications associated with diabetes mel-
litus would be enhanced by introducing health literacy 
assessments to established, well-characterized commu-
nity-based cohort studies.
Health literacy has been incorporated into a range of 
interventions to improve outcomes in individuals with 
diabetes mellitus, particularly those with educational, 
social, and economic vulnerabilities.142–145 Strengths 
have been the outreach to economically and socially 
disadvantaged individuals, particularly Spanish-speak-
ing adults, and 12-month follow-up to assess for sus-
tained improvements in outcomes relevant to diabetes 
mellitus. Swavely et al143 reported improvement in dia-
betes mellitus knowledge and limited but statistically 
significant 12-month improvement in hemoglobin A1c 
(7.98±1.4% to 7.43±1.4%). A randomized trial used 
multidisciplinary care with enhanced, individualized 
communication targeting comprehension of diabetes 
mellitus knowledge and self-care.144 Of individuals with 
limited health literacy, those receiving the intervention 
had significant success in achieving diabetes mellitus 
control, defined as reaching a target hemoglobin A1c 
≤7.0% (42% vs 15% of those receiving standard care). 
In contrast, individuals with higher health literacy re-
ceiving the intervention showed rates of success com-
parable to those receiving standard care. An educa-
tional intervention tailored for low-income Latinos with 
diabetes mellitus demonstrated a 4-month improve-

ment in glycemic control.145 Of note, the improvement 
was not sustained at 12 months. These results suggest 
that multidisciplinary and culturally appropriate inter-
ventions that mitigate health literacy–related barriers 
are needed to achieve sustainable results.
Health literacy in individuals with limited English 
proficiency and immigrant cohorts has received in-
creased focus.146 Selected studies have examined 
health literacy using qualitative and quantitative meth-
ods to investigate the relationship between health lit-
eracy and diabetes mellitus knowledge, acculturation, 
and access to care.147–150 However, interventions that 
improve access to language-appropriate services and 
health literacy support for patients with limited English 
proficiency are needed.151
Obesity, Diet, and Health Literacy
Health literacy informs health-related knowledge and 
self-efficacy, which are essential for the promotion of 
healthy behaviors such as physical activity and general 
health maintenance.152 The literature consistently dem-
onstrates the association between health literacy and 
obesity, dietary choices, and exercise.153–155 In Spanish-
speaking individuals in the United States with limited 
English proficiency, higher health literacy has been 
related to increased exercise and fruit and vegetable 
consumption.153 A study of rural, low-income, predom-
inantly black, high school–educated adults identified 
a significant association between Healthy Eating Index 
scores and health literacy and an inverse correlation 
between health literacy and sugar-sweetened bever-
age intake.155
Educational programs aimed at dietary changes for 
individuals with limited health literacy have been dem-
onstrated to affect caloric consumption significantly. 
A 6-month educational intervention used health lit-
eracy-focused strategies to decrease consumption of 
sugar-sweetened beverages (227 kcal/d) and show an 
improvement in body mass index in a medically under-
served lower-income community.156 It remains unknown 
how mobile and electronic technologies can best sup-
port dietary and exercise interventions in individuals 
with limited health literacy.157
In elementary school–aged children, limited paren-
tal health literacy is associated with a 25% increased 
risk of obesity.94 Parents with limited health literacy 
are twice as likely to perceive their overweight child as 
being normal weight, and obesity in adolescents cor-
relates with the adolescent’s health literacy.94 Health 
literacy may constitute a barrier to childhood physical 
activity.158 Community-based interventions such as the 
Greenlight program have been designed to address 
the role of health literacy in childhood obesity and nu-
trition.159
There are significant opportunities for developing 
programs to address health literacy challenges in rela-
tion to obesity and diet. Community- and school-based 
educational programs provide avenues for educating 
youth in communities vulnerable to limited health lit-
eracy. The life course impact of limited health literacy 
on obesity merits examination. Making weight loss, 
exercise, and diet education programs accessible and 
available to individuals with limited health literacy is 
essential. Interventions and programs that incorporate 
mobile health offer novel opportunities but must be de-
veloped so that health literacy is not a barrier for par-
ticipation.
Tobacco Use and Health Literacy
The interrelation of health literacy, socioeconomic and 
demographic factors, and tobacco use and cessation 
is complex.160 In an urban, multiracial cohort (n=402), 
limited health literacy was related to increased risk of 
nicotine dependence and decreased knowledge deficits 
of smoking-related health risks.161 In the same cohort, 
researchers found that individuals with limited health 
literacy were 3.2 times more likely to suffer a relapse 
in smoking after a cessation program.162 The number 
of studies focusing specifically on health literacy and 
tobacco use is limited. However, the findings demon-
strate the relevance of incorporating health literacy into 
tobacco treatment and cessation programming. These 
findings are consistent with the overall findings pre-
sented in this statement that health literacy is associ-
ated with health-related self-care and healthier lifestyle 
and behaviors.
Coronary Heart Disease and Health 
Literacy
The authors of this statement identified only a limited 
number of studies that examined health literacy as 
an independent variable in relation to cardiovascular 
risk, incident cardiovascular events, and strategies to 
improve or augment secondary prevention after car-
diac events. Nevertheless, health literacy has been 
associated with poorer outcomes preceding and fol-
lowing coronary events. In a hospital-based registry 
of 1967 patients (1197 [60.9%] with acute coronary 
syndrome), limited health literacy and numeracy pro-
ficiency were associated with decreased adherence to 
medications preceding admission.163 Health literacy has 
likewise been associated with 30-day readmission after 
acute coronary syndromes.95 Medicare enrollees with 
literacy levels determined as above basic had a 12% 
reduced risk of readmission than those with basic or 
below-basic literacy.

To date, interventions addressing health literacy in 
individuals with CVD have focused primarily on medi-
cation adherence, including pharmacy-led interven-
tions that prompt medication refills and graphic illus-
trations that promote accurate and timely medication 
taking.164,165 One systematic review166 found that the 
use of pictorial aids may enhance patients’ under-
standing of how to take medications, especially when 
combined with other patient education, either written 
or oral. However, results are mixed. The IMAGE-CHD 
study165 (Improving Medication Adherence Through 
Graphically Enhanced Interventions in Coronary Heart 
Disease) compared the effects of 2 low-literacy inter-
ventions (illustrated medication schedules and refill 
reminder postcards) on medication adherence in an 
underserved population with CVD (n=435; mean age, 
63.7 years; 91% black; 78% reading below the ninth-
grade level). Subjects were randomly assigned to refill 
reminder postcards, illustrated medication schedules, 
both interventions, or usual care for 1 year. Post hoc 
subgroup analyses suggested that illustrated medica-
tion schedules may be a useful approach among pa-
tients with low medication self-efficacy, polypharmacy, 
or baseline nonadherence. In the multisite PILL-CVD 
trial99 (Pharmacist Intervention for Low Literacy in 
Cardiovascular Disease), the effects of a pharmacist-
assisted intervention focused on medication recon-
ciliation, inpatient pharmacist counseling, low-literacy 
adherence aids, and tailored telephone follow-up af-
ter discharge from healthcare use were examined in a 
sample of 851 patients with acute coronary syndrome 
and decompensated heart failure. The intervention 
had benefit in individuals with inadequate health lit-
eracy, reducing 30-day risk of healthcare use by 59% 
in the intervention cohort (hazard ratio, 0.41; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.17–1.00). The results sug-
gest that a multifaceted approach targeting individuals 
with limited health literacy may be useful in improving 
healthcare outcomes.
Few studies have addressed the complexity of CVD 
treatment regimens for patients with limited health lit-
eracy; the authors of this statement found crucial gaps 
in the literature. Studies examining health literacy and 
CVD outcomes beyond 30-day readmission are essen-
tial. Multicenter trials with longer periods of follow-up 
are needed to clarify how interventions incorporating 
health literacy are associated with CVD events. Fur-
thermore, studies in individuals of limited English profi-
ciency are needed, given the multiple challenges of ad-
herence, knowledge, self-care, and activation. Finally, 
health literacy can be evaluated as part of programs 
aiming to reduce CVD risk and to improve secondary 
prevention. For example, limited health literacy may be 
1 factor that influences dropout rates in cardiac reha-
bilitation.166 Individuals with limited health literacy may 
experience barriers to referral to, engagement with, 
and participation in cardiac rehabilitation services and 
thus miss the physiological and nonphysiological ben-
efits after coronary events.
Congestive Heart Failure and Health 
Literacy
Limited health literacy is highly prevalent in individuals 
with heart failure, and the relation of health literacy to 
heart failure outcomes has been confirmed in diverse 
studies. A systematic review of 20 unique studies of 
health literacy and heart failure identified the average 
prevalence of limited health literacy as 39% across all 
studies (range, 19%–61%).168 In individuals with heart 
failure, limited health literacy has been associated with 
1.3- to 2-fold higher all-cause mortality in hospital and 
community-based cohorts.104,109 In individuals with 
heart failure presenting to the emergency room, limited 
numeracy has been related to 40% greater likelihood 
of returning to the hospital within 30 days.169 These 
data indicate that health literacy strongly contributes to 
adverse outcomes in heart failure.170
Health literacy has likewise been identified as a bar-
rier to successful self-care in heart failure. Matsuoka et 
al171 identified “critical” health literacy (ie, health liter-
acy challenges related to the cognitive ability to evalu-
ate and process information172) as related to symptom 
monitoring and management for self-care in individu-
als with heart failure. Individuals with limited health lit-
eracy have less heart failure knowledge and decreased 
capacity for the self-care activities essential for heart 
failure.102 Health literacy is likewise an independent de-
terminant of successful self-care behaviors used to as-
sess treatment options and to make decisions.171
Interventions to improve health literacy in individu-
als with heart failure have been diverse and varied. 
Strategies have included use of low-literacy and stan-
dardized materials and implementation of clinician 
follow-up.173–175 One program used graphic illustrations 
to provide education and targeted symptom monitor-
ing.176 Pictures included common avenues for patient 
engagement in heart failure self-assessment such as 
monitoring for weight gain and assessing for ankle ede-
ma. An intervention (n=123) using a self-management 
program designed for individuals with limited literacy 
reported a reduced rate of all-cause hospitalization; 
however, differences in hospitalization for heart failure 
and quality of life did not reach statistical significance 
when the intervention group was compared with con-
trol cohorts at the 12-month follow-up.177 A multisite 
comparative effectiveness trial (n=605) evaluated sin-
gle-session versus multisession telephone-based inter-
vention and found an effect by literacy status for the 
secondary outcome of all-cause hospitalization: Individ-
uals with limited health literacy receiving the multises-

tion (incidence rate ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.24–0.92).106
A common theme is that education may improve 
behaviors such as adherence, dietary choices, and life-
style modification; enhance monitoring for symptoms; 
and avoid clinical decompensation.178 Health literacy 
is integral to clinical education about patient monitor-
ing and self-assessment. Interventions that incorporate 
health literacy as a risk factor for adverse outcomes 
and a barrier to dietary and medication adherence may 
benefit from multidisciplinary strategies.173,179 A critical 
next step is implementation research to learn how to 
bring the benefits of patient education and empower-
ment for self-care among patients with heart failure to 
broader populations.
Stroke and Health Literacy
Health literacy related to stroke includes knowledge 
of risk factors for stroke prevention and recognition 
of warning signs for acute stroke therapy. Stroke pre-
paredness is the timely recognition of stroke symptoms 
and onset. Population-based studies have identified ra-
cial disparities in stroke preparedness,180 but how health 
literacy contributes to disparities in stroke recognition 
and knowledge has had limited examination. Because 
rapid intervention is essential for improved outcomes in 
stroke treatment, initiatives have focused on improving 
stroke literacy. Examples include the TLL Temple Foun-
dation Stroke Project, a rural behavioral intervention181; 
the Cincinnati, OH, efforts, based in beauty parlors, to 
convey culturally meaningful stroke education182; Hip 
Hop Stroke, targeting black elementary school chil-
dren by incorporating culturally relevant music183; and 
a community-based trial targeting Mexican American 
middle school-aged children in which students who 
received the intervention demonstrated greater stroke 
literacy than a referent cohort who did not.184
Health literacy related to stroke symptoms and signs 
remains poor, with low recognition of cardinal stroke 
symptoms and awareness of acute treatments.185–187 
Interventions developed for individuals of limited 
health literacy have consistently shown improvement in 
knowledge and recognition of stroke signs and symp-
toms.182,188–190 A community-based intervention con-
ducted in churches reported that stroke knowledge and 
behavioral response were improved with presentation 
of stroke vignettes.191 The studies cited here demon-
strate the opportunities for enhanced stroke education 
that is delivered with culturally appropriate vehicles. 
The interventions target families and children to em-
power and prompt rapid action for stroke recognition. 
Moving forward, programs to prevent stroke and im-
prove stroke preparedness should promote awareness 
that stroke is imminently preventable and treatable.
Atrial Fibrillation and Health Literacy
Treatment of the complex syndrome of atrial fibril-
lation (AF) involves education, decision making, and 
long-term adherence. Health literacy is correlated with 
education and socioeconomic position, and these fac-
tors may be associated with medication and behavioral 
adherence, communication about symptoms, health-
related quality of life, access to and experience of care, 
and outcomes relevant to AF (hospitalization, stroke, 
heart failure, cognitive and physical decline).
Individuals with limited health literacy are particularly 
vulnerable to having a limited knowledge of AF and its 
treatments. In an international survey of physicians (11 
countries, n=810), 46% described their patients as un-
able to explain what AF is and indicated that more than 
half of their patients needed more information about 
the condition.192 In a health maintenance organization, 
individuals with AF and inadequate health literacy, as 
assessed by a 3-item screening instrument, were shown 
to have decreased awareness of AF (prevalence ratio, 
0.96; 95% CI, 0.94–0.98).193 Knowledge about AF was 
shown to be directly correlated with level of education 
in a single-center cohort.194 Only <10% of those receiv-
ing care (n=183) were able to report the indication for 
anticoagulation; those with inadequate health literacy 
had a 5-fold increased risk of not understanding the 
indication for warfarin.195
Unfortunately, one-off educational sessions as 
an intervention may have limited impact on patient 
knowledge, given that retention has been reported as 
poor.196,197 Cochrane analyses identified a small num-
ber of studies (n=8–11) evaluating the effect of educa-
tional and behavioral interventions on anticoagulation 
as measured by improvement in time in therapeutic 
range and did not identify sufficient evidence that such 
interventions affect time in therapeutic range in indi-
viduals with AF.198,199 However, a subsequent, limited-
size (n=97) multimodality intervention demonstrated 
a 6-month improvement in time in therapeutic range 
that was not sustained to 12 months.200 A large clini-
cal trial showed 12-month improvement in adherence 
to guidelines-based care and reduced hospitalization 
by implementing a nurse-led, multidisciplinary inter-
vention.201 Consistent with other CVD risk factors and 
outcomes discussed here, multidisciplinary approaches 
may provide opportunities for continued reinforcement 
of educational programming to facilitate improved AF 
care. By necessity, to succeed, such interventions must 
adopt the universal precautions approach to be acces-
sible across the health literacy spectrum.
Ongoing challenges in evaluating health literacy and 
AF are multiple. There has been limited investigation 
into how health literacy may influence evaluation and 
treatment in AF. For the individual, the AHA/American

on treatment of AF emphasizes the recognition and 
treatment of symptoms.202 The extent to which health 
literacy may influence how individuals report and moni-
tor symptoms requires further examination. Shared de-
cision making has relevance for AF because of the mul-
tiple decision points that may significantly influence the 
course of treatment,203 but tools and strategies need 
to be accessible across the spectrum of health literacy. 
Community- and institution-based cohorts can further 
our understanding of health literacy and its relation to 
adverse outcomes in AF. Individuals with limited health 
literacy and AF may experience worse outcomes and 
have decreased access to treatments and specialized 
care. Rather than seeking to tailor treatment by health 
literacy level, centers or hubs of AF care should adapt 
strategies that facilitate access to care and patient sup-
port regardless of health literacy level. The ongoing 
challenge for institutions is to develop as health-literate 
organizations in their care for those with AF and other 
cardiovascular conditions.204
INTEGRATING HEALTH LITERACY INTO 
CARDIOVASCULAR RISK TREATMENT 
AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS
Integrating the AHRQ Universal 
Precautions Toolkit into Cardiovascular 
Care
The AHRQ Universal Precautions Toolkit for Health Lit-
eracy,18 or Toolkit, is a publicly available document fo-
cused on improving quality of care. The Toolkit advo-
cates an orientation to health literacy consistent with 
the universal precautions approach: best practices, 
instituted without exception, to provide a uniform, 
coherent standard of care.73–75 Consequently, the goal 
is not to tailor patient instructions, teaching, approach 
to care, or shared decision making according to in-
dividual patients’ level of health literacy. Rather, the 
objective is to develop and maintain a best practices 
approach—universal precautions—in written and oral 
encounters with patients. To emphasize, the objec-
tive of the Toolkit and health literacy advocacy is to 
provide practical approaches for clear oral and writ-
ten communication to help patients better understand 
their health information.
The Toolkit includes a 21-step approach to imple-
ment a health literacy improvement plan that is scal-
able for healthcare delivery of any size and context. 
Fundamentally, healthcare providers who listen, speak 
slowly, use nonmedical language, encourage ques-
tions, apply teach-back methods, and integrate the 
use of graphics or models are creating a culture of 
patient care that is sensitive to health literacy. Table 4

examples for their implementation in cardiovascular 
care, including primary and secondary prevention. 
The authors of this statement advocate the systematic 
adoption of the Toolkit as a resource for integrating 
health literacy in CVD prevention and management. 
Integrating Toolkit principles of being attentive to 
health literacy is practical and sensible. Cardiovascular 
centers can create health literacy-sensitive educational 
and consent materials; provide health literacy-appro-
priate education materials in waiting rooms and web-
sites; and teach health literacy-attentive communica-
tion to practices.205
Impact of Health Literacy on 
Cardiovascular Treatment and Care
Individuals with CVD are expected to adhere to com-
plex medication and dietary regimens and to make de-
cisions about how to respond to symptoms.206 The cur-
rent literature has explored the association of health 
literacy and self-care of CVDs, which encompasses 
treatment adherence and symptom monitoring, and 
early response to symptoms when they occur.178 In 
general, adequate self-care has been shown to im-
prove cardiovascular outcomes, including improved 
quality of life and symptom burden and reductions 
in hospitalizations and mortality.178,207–209 However, 
despite the availability of patient education, self-care 
remains especially challenging for those with limited 
health literacy.210
Health literacy in individuals with CVD includes the 
ability to understand medication instructions, discharge 
and appointment forms, and education materials (eg, 
dietary instructions), as well as the ability to negotiate 
complex healthcare systems.211 People with cardiovas-
cular risk factors and CVD are aided by skills in read-
ing, listening, analytical thinking, and decision making, 
as well as the ability to apply these skills to their spe-
cific health situation.1 Finding ways to support people 
who do not have advanced skills in these areas is the 
challenge posed by the field of health literacy because 
this literature shows the injustice of designing complex 
systems that work only for people with high levels of 
education and empowerment.212 Inattention to the un-
needed complexities in our jargon-filled communica-
tions is not a safe or particularly effective approach to 
patient care and contributes to health disparities.
Adequate health literacy is associated with a high-
er level of understanding of medications and lifestyle 
modifications in populations with diabetes mellitus and 
congestive heart failure. This effect may be mediated 
by self-efficacy, which allows patients to take owner-
ship of their treatment when they understand the ra-
tionale for each strategy. Adequate health literacy also 
allows patients to avoid medication errors and manage 
polypharmacy, to understand which symptoms may 
be caused by CVD and initiate timely response as in-
structed, and to report side effects that could affect 
outcomes. Furthermore, self-efficacy, patient engage-
ment, and shared decision making have been increas-
ingly promoted as approaches to enhance care. The 
writing group for this statement recognizes that work 
is needed to refine intervention models to attain sus-
tained and generalizable results.
Health Literacy and Participation in 
Clinical Research
A basic tenet outlined in bioethics principles of clinical 
research and codified in the Belmont report is respect 
for individuals with the associated requirement that 
patients are adequately informed about the nature of 
research and the voluntary nature of participation.213 
For multiple reasons, limited health literacy has been 
strongly associated with lower participation rates in 
clinical research.214 Limited health literacy may be as-
sociated with researchers not offering participation in 
studies because of a perception of lower understanding 
of the risks and benefits of research or a concern that 
follow-up or adherence could be compromised. The na-
ture of the informed consent document may be such 
that the complexity of the language could be a barrier 
to participation, and distrust of the healthcare system 
may play an important role. Alternatively, when indi-
viduals with limited health literacy are informed about 
the nature of research in a culturally tailored manner 
and given the opportunity to participate, their enroll-
ment rates may be similar to those of individuals with 
higher health literacy.
The study by Ownby et al215 evaluated the associa-
tion between health literacy and understanding orally 
presented informed consent information in a sample of 
334 English- or Spanish-speaking participants. Health

literacy, numeracy, education, and the interaction of 
health literacy and education accounted for 29% of 
the variability in performance scores. This suggests that 
other demographics (eg, race, ethnicity, sex) may not 
be as important as health literacy and education.
The problem of health literacy and informed consent 
is highlighted by the cross-sectional study by Paasche-
Orlow et al216 that examined the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) readability standards and informed con-
sent form templates of 114 US medical schools. Using 
documents accessed from the schools’ websites, the 
study reported that readability varied widely from the 
5th to 10th grade (mean, 10.6; 95% CI, 10.3–10.8). 
The mean Flesch-Kincaid score, a commonly used mea-
sure of readability,217 for sample text provided by IRBs 
exceeded stated standards by 2.8 (95% CI, 2.4–3.2) 
grade levels, illustrating that typical informed consent 
material likely challenges those with limited health liter-
acy. In 2013, Paasche-Orlow et al218 updated the analy-
sis of informed consent form templates (sample n=109) 
and reported a mean readability level of 9.8 (95% CI, 
9.4–10.2), representing a significant improvement from 
or lower mean readability level (P<0.0001) compared 
with the earlier study. Similarly, there was a slight im-
provement in consistency of the sample text with IRB 
standards (mean improvement, 2.2 grade levels; 95% 
CI, 1.7–2.8). However, most of the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act sample content did 
not reach IRB standards, exceeding the targeted stan-
dard by a mean of 4.2 (95% CI, 3.4–5.0) grade levels.
There are several recommendations to address the 
informed consent challenges faced by those with lim-
ited health literacy. First, informed consent documents 
should meet IRB readability standards, especially the 
most complex portions like the Health Insurance Por-
tability and Accountability Act material. For many in-
dividuals, these standards may still be challenging, so 
tailoring the informed consent to participants’ health 
literacy level is recommended.215 Alternative strategies 
for ensuring confirmability of informed consent include 
the teach to goal approach219 and the Brief Informed 
Consent Evaluation Protocol, which uses a telephone 
interview after consent process.220 Results of the ePRISM 
study221 (Patient Risk Information Services Manager), 
which generated personalized consent forms that were 
based on a patient’s specific clinical risk, suggest that 
a personalized consent document can improve the pa-
tient’s understanding of the purpose and risks of proce-
dures, engage patients in shared decision making, and 
thus improve process of informed consent.
Strategies and Future Directions for 
Incorporating Health Literacy for 
Vulnerable Populations
Improving health literacy among those at highest risk 
and with the lowest economic resources poses a unique 
challenge. The use of health information technology, 
including mobile apps to improve self-care behaviors in 
patients with CVD and to prevent CVD risk by promot-
ing healthy behaviors, is on the rise222 and may be ben-
eficial in individuals with limited health literacy. How-
ever, for individuals who cannot afford a smartphone 
or who have inconsistent Internet connections, those 
benefits are unlikely to permeate. Use of mobile health 
platforms may present an attractive option for patient-
oriented education, text messages, and social network-
ing to help with chronic disease management. Howev-
er, a mobile health intervention study found that those 
least engaged with text messaging and automated calls 
were racial or ethnic minorities, older adults, and those 
with limited health literacy.223 This result suggests that 
reliance on mobile health solutions to mitigate health 
literacy concerns has the potential to exacerbate dis-
parities in vulnerable populations; the “health literacy 
divide” may reinforce what has been described as the 
“digital divide.”21
Several investigators have explored novel mecha-
nisms for improving CVD-related health literacy. An 
important component of these interventions is that 
an understanding of limited health literacy does not 
exist in isolation with poverty but that other barriers 
to communication exist, including language and cul-
turally appropriate messaging.224 For example, promis-
ing avenues for improving knowledge of stroke signs 
and symptoms have involved the use of hairstylists 
to deliver health messages in predominantly black 
populations,182 houses of worship for Spanish-speak-
ing patients,225 and hip-hop music to educate urban, 
school-aged children.189,226 The use of novel avenues 
of communication such as case vignettes of possible 
patients reflective of the community may also be an 
additional culturally tailored approach.191
Multidisciplinary interventions have incorporated 
nonmedical providers such as pharmacists and com-
munity health workers to address health literacy chal-
lenges in CVD, with successful improvement in out-
comes.227–230 Common themes emerge in several of 
these interventions, which hold the potential for gen-
eralizability to other settings. First, such interventions 
are community centered and address barriers to care 
that are specific to individual communities. Such insight 
may provide a starting point for launching broader in-
terventions that account for health literacy as a barrier 
to improved CVD screening, prevention, and manage-
ment. Second, interventions that incorporate health 
literacy tend to be further enriched by accounting for

other social determinants of health: the economic, cul-

Toward a Health-Literate Cardiovascular 
Organization and Program
This statement has articulated how limited health lit-
eracy may contribute to increased risk for a range of 
cardiovascular risk factors and conditions. Individuals 
with limited health literacy face challenges in access-
ing and navigating health care, and such obstacles 
may be exacerbated by family, community, and so-
cial factors. Health literacy is a ubiquitous challenge 
throughout any healthcare system, particularly be-
cause only 12% of US adults have the health lit-
eracy skills to navigate its complexity successfully.24 
Health literacy interfaces with the electronic portal, 
the physical layout and use of signage for directions, 
patient instructions, informed consent, the discharge 
plan, and the complex multitude of communication 
with patients and their families. The systemic chal-
lenge is, therefore, to develop healthcare systems 
that are accessible and for which health literacy is 
not an obstacle.
The concept of the health-literate organization 
has emerged in response to the challenges.231 The 
concept of the health-literate organization has a 
3-fold intent. First, it asserts that health literacy as 
a problem belongs to the institution, not the indi-
vidual patient, and declares health literacy as a basic 
condition and standard for health care. Patients can-
not be expected, for instance, to adapt their literacy 
to meet the complex demands of medical care. As 
stated, “Being a health literate organization should 
not be seen as a luxury….Rather, it is a necessary 
prerequisite to assuring patient safety, promoting ad-
herence, enhancing self-efficacy, and improving pa-
tient outcomes.”204 Second, it provides a standard for 
development as a health-literate organization. Ten 
attributes of a health-literate organization231 have 
been articulated, and they provide substantive guid-
ance for cardiovascular centers and organizations to 
make it easier for their constituencies and patients to 
seek and receive health care. The attributes of such 
an organization may be used to design road maps 
for institutional growth to become a health-literate 
organization. The 10 attributes span an attention to 
health literacy from healthcare institutional leader-
ship, organization framework, and care delivery. Fi-
nally, the declaration of a health-literate organization 
emphasizes the need for a comprehensive program. 
Health literacy is not the bailiwick of a few individu-
als; the responsibility for pursuing a health-literate 
organization belongs to every individual who asso-
ciates with patients, starting at the front desk and 
extending to the examination room, hospital ward, 
and executive boardroom. In Figure 3, we summarize 
critical domains and their relevant challenges and so-
lutions for addressing health literacy.
Figure 3. Multilevel domains of health literacy and challenges and solutions for achieving a health-literate  
organization.  
Health literacy is operative in the healthcare organization, physician and provider, family and community, and individual patient. The organization has the chief 
responsibility and capacity for implementing strategies for effective healthcare delivery that address health literacy challenges.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR HEALTH 
LITERACY AND CVD
Health literacy has dynamic and important interfaces 
with CVD prevention, recognition, management, and 
treatment. The authors of this statement recognize that 
links between inadequate health literacy and cardio-
vascular outcomes can be confounded by substantial 
overlap with other social determinants of health, in-
cluding social and economic position, educational at-
tainment, access to care, and cultural affiliations. We 
conclude that the relations between health literacy and 
CVD risk and outcomes described in this statement are 
independent, valid, and significant. Inadequate health 
literacy is a barrier that will need to be overcome to 
fulfill the mission of cardiovascular health across the 
spectrum of prevention, screening, and treatment. The 
public health effectiveness of cardiovascular treatments 
that have demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials can-
not be realized without managing the issue of health 
literacy. Further work on health literacy in patients with 
or at risk for CVD should therefore focus on effectively 
addressing the adverse health impact of limited health 
literacy. The authors of this statement note the follow-
ing questions as priorities:
1. How can healthcare organizations mitigate the 
effects of inadequate health literacy on CVD 
risk and outcomes? Addressing health literacy is 
an institutional mandate; decreasing health lit-
eracy barriers is the responsibility of healthcare 
organizations. Individuals, centers, departments, 
and institutions can collaborate for multilevel 
strategies that incorporate and address health 
literacy by removing unneeded complexity, thus 
advancing patient empowerment and education 
to improve healthcare delivery. Although many 
aspects of the AHRQ Toolkit can be readily imple-
mented by healthcare organizations, opportuni-
ties to further establish promote health-literate 
organizations are evident.
•  
In terms of preventive cardiology, interventions 
at the organizational level focused on hyper-
tension, diabetes mellitus, diet, and exercise 
that are effective and scalable should be dis-
seminated. Appropriate incentives for health-
care organizations to use such interventions 
should be considered.
•  
In terms of treatment of established CVDs 
such as acute coronary syndromes, heart fail-
ure, stroke, and AF, interventions that can be 
recommended with confidence are less widely 
available. Tools that support shared decision 
making for complex preference-sensitive pro-
cedures such as percutaneous coronary inter-
ventions and radiofrequency ablation need to 
be validated and disseminated.
•  
Any and all resources provided to patients 
should be usable and empowering for peo-
ple across the spectrum of health literacy. 
Assessment of readability is paramount and 
may identify text that is obviously too complex. 
However, readability assessment is not suffi-
cient as a mechanism to determine what mate-
rial will be understood and effective.
2. How can individual physicians mitigate the effects 
of inadequate health literacy on CVD? Improving 
the skills of physicians in understanding the 
health literacy challenges of their patients and 
communicating complex health concepts requires 
continued attention. Mechanisms to inculcate 
an approach of universal precautions in which 
patient comprehension is proactively confirmed 
need to be further elaborated.
3. How can the AHA as an organization address 
health literacy? For the AHA, it is imperative to 
develop a best practices approach to health lit-
eracy and to be a leader in promoting mas-
sive improvements in patient education and 
empowerment.
•  
Material developed by the AHA can be evalu-
ated and tested by patient stakeholders and 
individuals with demonstrated content exper-
tise in health literacy, with easily accessible 
online assessments to determine grade-level 
readability.
•  
The AHA can recognize and legitimize health 
literacy and its relevance for cardiovascular 
outcomes. The AHA can incorporate health 
literacy as part of the curricula of profes-
sional meetings, webinars, and professional 
learning opportunities, as well as in scientific 
statements. The AHA can include health lit-
eracy as a targeted factor in health services 
research-funding mechanisms. The AHA can 
encourage council leadership to recognize and 
address health literacy as an obstacle for opti-
mal cardiovascular health. An integrated, mul-
tilevel, cross-disciplinary approach will likely be 
needed for the AHA to enhance an organiza-
tional approach to health literacy.
4. What is the impact of the rise in information 
technology on those with inadequate health 
literacy? The increasing reliance on health 
information via the Internet and social media 
threatens to exclude individuals with limited 
health literacy. People may lack access to such 
resources. However, information technology 
may emerge as an effective path to mitigating 
inadequate health literacy through such things 
as interactive text messaging and graphic or 
video communication. Technology alone, with-
out adaptation for health literacy challenges, is

eracy challenges.
5. How should awareness of limited health literacy 
affect the design and conduct of clinical trials? 
Because of the complexity of informed consent 
for clinical trials and the lack of standardization 
across institutional review boards, individuals with 
inadequate health literacy may inadvertently be 
excluded from clinical trials. Consequently, the 
external validity of clinical trials may be limited by 
the lack of attention to health literacy. Similarly, 
without evaluation or measurement of health lit-
eracy, imbalances in effect by health literacy can-
not be measured. Health literacy measurement 
should be explored as an important baseline vari-
able in trials.
6. What is the role of communities in mitigating 
inadequate health literacy in CVD? Because 
inadequate health literacy often coexists with 
characteristics such as educational attainment 
and income, individuals with inadequate health 
literacy may be segregated by neighborhood 
and community. Involving community groups 
in efforts to address health literacy appears to 
be feasible on the basis of available research 
and deserves wider study. Community agencies 
and representatives can provide leadership and 
participate as stakeholders for programs and 
interventions.
7. What is the impact of an increasingly complex 
healthcare financing system on access for those 
with limited health literacy? Individual respon-
sibility for enrollment in health insurance plans, 
frequent changes between different health insur-
ance plans, and complex plans with high deduct-
ible levels are realities of American health care. 
Although the evaluation of the impact of health 
literacy on healthcare access and financing is 
beyond the scope of this statement, the impacts 
of health literacy on healthcare access and financ-
ing merit investigation. Advocacy for an equitable 
healthcare system must also incorporate health 
literacy obstacles in the access to and administra-
tion of health care.
8. What are the next steps in health literacy inves-
tigation and scholarship? Throughout this state-
ment, the authors have identified knowledge 
gaps and opportunities for further research that 
integrates health literacy. Researchers conducting 
clinical, health services, and outcomes investiga-
tions and clinical trialists have multiple opportu-
nities for incorporating health literacy into their 
studies. Priorities are to include health literacy 
assessments in cardiovascular studies and tri-
als to assess generalizability and to determine 
effect modification by health literacy as part of 
either primary or secondary analyses. Second, 
study materials for patients should be reviewed 
with the objective of maintaining the universal 
precautions approach described in this state-
ment. Third, multifaceted interventions should be 
developed that incorporate healthcare systems, 
providers, and patients. Researchers addressing 
health literacy should avoid being siloed, that is, 
developing interventions that are not integrated 
with the healthcare system, practice, and clinical 
interface that patients experience. Fourth, inclu-
sion of patient stakeholders with limited health 
literacy in patient advisory committees and simi-
lar bodies is fundamental for patient-centered 
outcomes research because such individuals 
will enhance and legitimize the development of 
patient-centered research. The final and most 
pressing priority is the examination of the imple-
mentation of a universal precautions approach in 
clinical care. As identified by this statement, the 
evidence for the significant contribution of health 
literacy to disparities is well established. Steps for-
ward must study how to improve the process of 
implementation of literacy sensitive strategies and 
interventions.
