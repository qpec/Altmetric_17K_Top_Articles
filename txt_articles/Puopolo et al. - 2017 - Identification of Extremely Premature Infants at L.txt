BACKGROUND: Premature infants are at high risk of early-onset sepsis (EOS) relative to term 
infants, and most are administered empirical antibiotics after birth. We aimed to determine 
if factors evident at birth could be used to identify premature infants at lower risk of EOS.
METHODS: Study infants were born at 22 to 28 weeks’ gestation in Neonatal Research Network 
centers from 2006 to 2014. EOS was defined by isolation of pathogenic species from blood 
or cerebrospinal fluid culture at ≤72 hours age. Infants were hypothesized as “low risk” for 
EOS when delivered via cesarean delivery, with membrane rupture at delivery, and absence 
of clinical chorioamnionitis. Frequency of prolonged antibiotics (≥5 days) was compared 
between low-risk infants and all others. Risks of mortality, EOS, and other morbidities 
were assessed by using regression models adjusted for center, race, antenatal steroid use, 
multiple birth, sex, gestation, and birth weight.
RESULTS: Of 15 433 infants, 5759 (37%) met low-risk criteria. EOS incidence among infants 
surviving >12 hours was 29 out of 5640 (0.5%) in the low-risk group versus 209 out of 8422 
(2.5%) in the comparison group (adjusted relative risk = 0.24 [95% confidence interval, 
0.16–0.36]). Low-risk infants also had significantly lower combined risk of EOS or death 
≤12 hours. Prolonged antibiotics were administered to 34% of low-risk infants versus 47% 
of comparison infants without EOS.
CONCLUSIONS: Delivery characteristics of extremely preterm infants can be used to identify 
those with significantly lower incidence of EOS. Recognition of differential risk may help 
guide decisions to limit early antibiotic use among approximately one-third of these infants.

What’s KnoWn on this subject: Characteristics 
known at birth including gestational age identify 
infants at highest risk of early-onset sepsis (EOS). It 
is unknown if delivery characteristics can be used 
to identify premature infants at lowest risk of EOS to 
guide empirical antibiotic therapy.
What this study adds: Specific criteria can 
identify premature infants with a 76% lower 
adjusted risk for EOS. A substantial proportion 
of these infants received prolonged antibiotics 
despite their lower a priori risk. Recognition of 
this differential risk may reduce early antibiotic 
exposures.

 Accurately estimating individual  
risk of early-onset sepsis (EOS) 
among very premature infants is 
challenging because of the relatively 
high incidence of clinical instability 
among these infants and the 
associated concern for sepsis as a 
treatable cause of such instability.1, 
 
2  
Antibiotics are initiated in the 
majority of extremely preterm 
infants and are frequently continued 
despite sterile blood cultures.3 
–5 Of 
concern, prolonged early antibiotic 
exposure has been associated with 
increased subsequent risk of late-
onset sepsis (LOS), necrotizing 
enterocolitis (NEC), severe 
retinopathy of prematurity, and 
death.3, 
 
6 
–9 Identification of premature 
infants at low risk of EOS may help 
guide decisions for initiating and/
or discontinuing empirical antibiotic 
treatments in the first days of life 
and would be a critical first step in 
promoting antibiotic stewardship 
among these infants.
The pathogenesis of EOS is 
predominantly that of ascending 
colonization of the uterine and 
fetal compartments with maternal 
recto-vaginal flora, progressing to 
inflammation and infection.10, 
 
11 
Preterm onset of labor and preterm 
rupture of amniotic membranes 
are both significantly associated 
with risk of EOS.12, 
 
13 However, a 
proportion of preterm deliveries 
occur because of maternal medical 
indications (such as preeclampsia) or 
for chronic fetal conditions (such as 
growth restriction).14 In the absence 
of labor or rupture of membranes 
(ROM), the risk of EOS in preterm 
infants delivered via cesarean 
delivery (CD) should be substantially 
lower compared with preterm infants 
delivered because of preterm labor 
or premature ROM. We accessed 
data collected by the Eunice Kennedy 
Shriver National Institute of Child 
Health and Human Development 
Neonatal Research Network (NRN) 
and used delivery characteristics to 
define a group of extremely preterm 
infants we hypothesized would be 
at lower risk for EOS. Our objectives 
were to compare the incidence of 
culture-confirmed EOS and the 
prevalence of prolonged early 
antibiotic treatment among infants 
with and without low EOS risk 
criteria.
Methods
study Population
Infants were born at NRN centers 
between January 1, 2006, and 
December 31, 2014, and enrolled in 
a registry maintained by the NRN. 
Inclusion criteria for the cohort 
studied were: gestational age (GA) 
22 weeks, 0 days to 28 weeks, 6 
days; birth weight (BW) 401 to 1500 
g; inborn; and no major congenital 
anomaly. Registry data included 
prospectively collected maternal 
pregnancy and delivery information; 
infant data from birth until death, 
hospital discharge or transfer, or 120 
days of age; and if hospitalized at 
120 days, final discharge or transfer 
date or death up to 1 year of age.15 
Participation in the registry was 
approved at most sites by the local 
institutional review board under a 
waiver of consent; 3 sites required 
parental consent.
delivery criteria for categorizing 
infants as hypothetically “Low Risk” 
for eos
Preterm labor was not recorded 
in the registry during the study 
period. Delivery characteristics 
likely to capture infants delivered for 
maternal health indications without 
preterm onset of labor were used 
to define a hypothesized low-risk 
group for EOS. Low-risk infants had 
all of the following characteristics: 
delivery by CD, ROM at delivery, 
and no documentation of maternal 
clinical chorioamnionitis in the 
obstetrical record. Infants without 
low-risk criteria were denoted as the 
“comparison” group for description 
of study results. In a secondary 
analysis, the low-risk group was 
further defined to also exclude 
infants of mothers with histologic 
diagnosis of chorioamnionitis on 
the basis of placental pathologic 
examination.
hospital outcomes and clinical 
interventions
Hospital morbidities and clinical 
interventions were recorded for 
infants who survived >12 hours. EOS 
(≤72 hours of age) and LOS (>72 
hours of age) were defined by blood 
or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures 
positive for pathogenic bacteria or 
fungi and antibiotic therapy ≥5 days 
or intent to treat and death within 5 
days. Micrococcus, Propionibacterium, 
Corynebacterium, Bacillus, and 
coagulase-negative staphylococci 
(CONS) grown on cultures of blood 
or CSF ≤72 hours of age were 
considered contaminants for the 
primary outcome of EOS incidence. 
Cultures growing ≥1 species of  
which at least 1 was considered a 
true pathogen were counted as EOS 
cases. For a secondary analysis, 
infants with CONS were included 
as EOS cases. CONS grown from 
LOS cultures were included as 
true pathogens. Other morbidities 
included respiratory distress 
syndrome defined by clinical features 
in the first 24 hours, pneumothorax, 
pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary 
interstitial emphysema, patent 
ductus arteriosus, NEC stage 2  
to 3, 
16, 
 
17 spontaneous intestinal 
perforation (SIP), severe intracranial 
hemorrhage (ICH) grade 3 or 418  
based on a cranial sonogram 
taken within 28 days of birth, 
periventricular leukomalacia 
(PVL), and bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia (BPD) defined as need for 
supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks 
postmenstrual age (PMA). Surviving 
infants discharged or transferred 
before 36 weeks PMA were classified 
on the basis of their status at 36 
weeks, if known, or on the basis of 
oxygen use at discharge or transfer. 
Small for gestational age (SGA) was

Prolonged early antibiotic therapy 
was defined as receipt of antibiotics 
for ≥5 days starting <72 hours of age 
(or intent to treat for ≥5 days in an 
infant who died within 5 days and 
was receiving antibiotics). Those who 
did not receive prolonged antibiotics 
were either not started on antibiotics 
<72 hours, or had antibiotics 
initiated but discontinued before 5 
days. Other interventions recorded 
included receipt of surfactant, nitric 
oxide, treatment of hypotension, 
and duration and type of respiratory 
support.
statistical analysis
Characteristics and outcomes were 
compared between infants in the 
low-risk and comparison groups. 
Additionally, we compared outcomes 
for low-risk infants with and without 
early prolonged antibiotics, excluding 
infants with any of the following at 
<7 days of age: positive blood or CSF 
culture results (including isolates 
considered contaminants in this 
study) and/or a diagnosis of NEC 
or SIP. Statistical significance for 
unadjusted comparisons between 
groups was determined by χ2 test for 
categorical variables and Wilcoxon 
test for continuous variables. Poisson 
regression models with robust 
variance estimators20 were used to 
assess risk of mortality, the primary 
outcome EOS, and other binary 
outcomes in comparison groups while 
adjusting for study center, maternal 
race and/or ethnicity, antenatal steroid 
use, multiple birth, sex, GA (categorical 
by week), and BW (continuous). 
Adjusted relative risks (aRRs), 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs), and P 
values by the score or Wald χ2 test 
from these models were reported. 
Morbidity outcomes were compared 
between low-risk and comparison 
infants surviving >12 hours, accounting 
for the age at which assessment took 
place. Combined death or morbidity 
outcomes were also examined to

study Population
Between January 1, 2006, and 
December 31, 2014, 16 185 infants 
with GA 22 to 28 weeks and BW 401 to 
1500 g were born at NRN centers. Of 
these, 640 (4%) infants with a major 
congenital anomaly, 111 (0.7%) infants 
with insufficient information (maternal 
clinical chorioamnionitis, 54; ROM, 
43; EOS or antibiotic information, 10; 
delivery type, 4), and 1 infant with 
congenital syphilis were excluded. 
Thus, 15 433 infants were studied, of 
whom 5759 (37.3%) were classified 
into the low-risk group and 9674 
(62.7%) into the comparison group.
Maternal and infant characteristics
By definition, all infants in the low-risk 
group were delivered by CD, without 
ROM before delivery, and none had 
maternal clinical chorioamnionitis 
(Table 1). Maternal histologic 
chorioamnionitis was reported for a 
smaller proportion of infants in the 
low-risk group versus the comparison 
group (21% vs 66%). Mothers in 
the low-risk group were more likely 
to suffer complications such as 
hypertension, more likely to receive 
antenatal corticosteroids, and less 
likely to receive antenatal antibiotics. 
Median gestation was higher in the 
low-risk group, as was the proportion 
of female infants, multiple births, and 
SGA infants. In all measures except 1 
(nitric oxide therapy), a significantly 
greater proportion of infants in the 
low-risk group had markers of illness 
and clinical intervention (Table 1).
Mortality and early-onset infection
The proportion of infants who died 
in the first 12 hours after birth was 
smaller in the low-risk group than in 
the comparison group (Table 2). Risk

within 12 hours or EOS was also 
reduced for infants in the low-risk 
group (2.6% vs 15.1%; aRR [95% 
CI]: 0.36 [0.30–0.43]). Among infants 
surviving >12 hours, 29 out of 5640 
(0.5%) in the low-risk group and 209 
out of 8422 (2.5%) in the comparison 
group had EOS (aRR [95% CI]: 0.24 
[0.16–0.36]). The risk of EOS in the 
low-risk group was consistently 
lower than in the comparison group 
for infants born at each GA, as well 
as when CONS cases were included. 
Escherichia coli was the most frequent 
pathogen isolated in both the low-
risk group (9 out of 29 cases) and the 
comparison group (103 out of 209 
cases) (Supplemental Tables 8 and 
9). The predictive performance of 
risk categorization by study criteria is 
shown in Supplemental Table 10. The 
likelihood of not having EOS was 3 
times greater for low-risk infants than 
for infants in the comparison group.
Placental pathology was available 
for 4802 out of 5622 (85.4%) low-
risk infants and 7202 out of 8394 
(85.7%) comparison infants surviving 
>12 hours (excluding those with 
no information). The proportion of 
infants with EOS was similar for those 
with and without placental pathology 
(with versus without pathology, low-
risk group: 0.5% vs 0.4%; comparison 
group: 2.5% vs 2.5%; P = .86 for 
overall difference). Among low-risk 
infants surviving >12 hours and 
born to mothers without a histologic 
diagnosis of chorioamnionitis on 
placental pathology, 10 out of 3771 
(0.3%) infants had EOS (Table 3).

Among infants who survived >12 
hours, the adjusted risks of respiratory 
distress syndrome, pulmonary 
hemorrhage, and patent ductus 
arteriosus were higher in the low-risk 
group compared with the comparison 
group (Table 4). The composite risks 
of death within 12 hours and each of 
pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial 
emphysema, NEC, and SIP, were lower 
in the low-risk group, as was the risk 
of LOS or death within 3 days, and the

Prolonged early antibiotic therapy 
in the absence of Positive culture 
Results
Among infants surviving >12 hours 
without EOS, 34.1% of infants in the 
low-risk group received prolonged 
early antibiotics compared with 47.4% 
in the comparison group, P < .001 
(Table 5). This difference persisted 
when infants with standard indications 
for antibiotic use (positive culture 
results, NEC, and/or SIP ≤7 days of life) 
were excluded. For each EOS case, 66 
low-risk infants received prolonged 
early antibiotics compared with 19 
infants in the comparison group, P < 
.001. Among low-risk and comparison 
infants, the proportion of infants who 
received prolonged early antibiotics 
varied by center (Fig 1). In comparison 
with the incidence of EOS cases, the 
proportion of infants treated with 
prolonged antibiotics was many times 
higher at all centers in both groups.
comparing Low-Risk Group infants 
With and Without Prolonged early 
antibiotic therapy
Maternal and delivery characteristics 
did not differ significantly between 
the 1771 infants in the low-risk 
group who received prolonged early 
antibiotics without a positive culture 
result and/or a diagnosis of NEC or 
SIP ≤7 days of life and the 3563 who 
did not (Supplemental Table 11). 
However, the low-risk infants who 
received prolonged early antibiotics 
were significantly younger and smaller 
at birth, more likely to be boys, SGA, 
and have 5 minute Apgar score <5, and 
more likely to have received surfactant 
and other interventions (Table 6). 
After adjustment for GA and other 
covariates, the adjusted risk of death 
after 7 days and before discharge 
and the composite outcomes of death 
and/or either NEC, SIP, or LOS were 
increased for low-risk infants who 
received prolonged early antibiotics 
compared with low-risk infants who 
did not (Table 7). Risks of pulmonary 
outcomes were also higher among low-
risk infants who received prolonged 
early antibiotics, including the risk of 
BPD among survivors to 36 weeks PMA 
(aRR [95% CI]: 1.28 [1.20–1.36]).
discussion
In this NRN cohort of extremely low 
gestation infants, characteristics 
evident at birth were able to be 
used to identify a group of infants 
with significantly lower risk of EOS. 
A third of the infants in the study 
cohort fulfilled the defined low-
risk delivery criteria. The lower 
incidence of EOS in this group was, 
however, not associated with a 
proportional reduction in prolonged 
early antibiotic therapy, presenting 
an opportunity to revisit current 
antibiotic prescribing practices.

 The lower incidence of EOS in the low-
risk cohort confirmed our hypothesis 
that the absence of factors that 
might reflect (eg, preterm labor) or 
promote (eg, membrane rupture) the 
pathogenesis of ascending infection 
would be associated with a reduced 
occurrence of infection. However, 29 
cases of EOS were identified in the 
low-risk group. These cases may be 
due to imprecision in our definition of 
these risk factors. The NRN database 
does not record presence of preterm 
labor, unexplained fetal distress, 
or criteria leading to a diagnosis of 
clinical chorioamnionitis. Therefore, 
we used CD with ROM at delivery and 
absence of clinical chorioamnionitis 
as indirect estimators. It is likely 
that we included some mothers who 
labored before being taken for a 
CD delivery before ROM, providing 
opportunity for ascending infection. 
Prospective collection of delivery 
criteria in real-time practice could 
improve capture of EOS risk factors 
and subsequently the precision of 
identifying infants at low risk for EOS. 
Hematogenous spread of infection 
across the placenta and infection after 
invasive intrauterine procedures can 
also rarely cause fetal infection.21 
Emerging evidence also points 
to a placental and amniotic fluid 
microbiome whose disturbance may 
be associated with preterm labor.22
Despite these limitations, the 76% 
lower risk of EOS among low-risk 
infants compared with the comparison 
group is substantial and warrants 
consideration in making management 
decisions. We recently reported 
a similar single-center study that 
included detailed maternal chart 
review of EOS cases among very low 
birth weight (VLBW) infants (BW 
<1500 g). In that study, we found a 
92% lower unadjusted risk for EOS 
among VLBW infants delivered by 
CD to mothers with a diagnosis of 
preeclampsia and without diagnoses 
of preterm ROM or chorioamnionitis, 
compared with VLBW infants born 
without these characteristics (1 out of 
605 [0.17%] vs 45 out of 2143 [2.1%], 
P = .001).23 The incidence of EOS in the 
current study was even lower (0.3% 
vs 0.5%) among low-risk infants when 
the definition was refined to exclude 
infants born in the setting of histologic 
as well as clinical chorioamnionitis. 
Placental histopathology results 
obtained shortly after delivery may 
further aid in decisions to continue 
early empirical antibiotic therapy 
beyond the first few days of age.
Our findings suggest that clinicians  
did not recognize the differential 
incidence of EOS among low-risk 
infants or failed to account for it 
in their antibiotic management 
decisions. Although prolonged 
empirical antibiotic use was lower 
among low-risk infants than among 
the comparison infants, the ratio 
of prolonged antibiotics to number 
of EOS cases was 3 times higher in 
the low-risk group. Fewer low-risk 
infants died at ≤12 hours, but those

 who survived were as sick as or sicker 
than comparison infants. Maternal 
morbidity, SGA status, and a stressed 
in utero environment in infants 
delivered for maternal indications are 
associated with greater respiratory 
morbidity and may explain the greater 
initial morbidity observed in the 
low-risk infants.24

26 Administration 
of antibiotics for increasing clinical 
instability and attribution of such 
instability to culture negative sepsis is 
well-documented in neonatal care.4, 
27, 
 
28  
A previous study revealed that >90% 
of all infants in an earlier NRN cohort 
were treated with antibiotics at birth.3 
We speculate that the greater need 
for intensive care interventions in 
the low-risk cohort and persistence 
of illness beyond 48 hours led to a 
reluctance to stop antibiotic treatment. 
These decisions are likely driven by 
clinical uncertainties and provider 
preference more than biology because 
we observed marked variation around 
prolonged antibiotic administration 
across study centers that did not 
correlate with variation in the 
incidence of EOS at these centers.
Clinicians make antibiotic and other 
treatment decisions to protect sick 
newborns, yet multiple reports 
now suggest harm from early and 
prolonged empirical antibiotics.3, 
 
6 
–9  
We addressed this issue with an 
analysis restricted to the low-risk 
group. To focus on potentially 
modifiable use of antibiotics, we 
limited this analysis to low-risk 
infants who received prolonged early 
antibiotics despite negative blood 
culture results and/or NEC or SIP in 
the first week of life. After adjusting 
for baseline characteristics associated 
with increased risk of morbidity 
and mortality, we still found higher 
subsequent mortality and increased 
incidence of BPD and other pulmonary 
outcomes among the low-risk infants 
who received prolonged early 
antibiotics. The decision to extend 
early empirical therapy may reflect a 
severity of initial illness that strongly 
influences subsequent morbidity 
and mortality in a manner for which 
we could not adequately account in 
our risk-adjusted analyses. However, 
there is evidence for the critical role 
of the early life microbiome in the 
development of neonatal immune 
responses and for the significant 
disruption of that microbiome 
induced by antibiotic exposure.29 
–33 
Although with this study we cannot 
determine why it may be, our findings 
reveal that among infants with a low 
previous probability of EOS, extended 
empirical administration of early 
antibiotics for critical illness may not 
be beneficial and could potentially be 
harmful.
Our study is limited by its 
retrospective design. During the 
study period, the registry lacked 
information on the indication for 
preterm delivery. We have no 
information on the presence of 
preterm labor, attempts to induce 
labor, or unexplained fetal distress. 
Information about antibiotic therapy 
was limited to whether antibiotics 
were started in the first 72 hours 
after birth and continued for ≥5 days. 
Types of antibiotics, total duration of 
antibiotic administration during the 
NICU admission, and indication for 
therapy were not recorded.

contaminant: 17 CONS, 3 Bacillus sp., 1 Micrococcus sp.), 44 with NEC ≤7 d, 79 with SIP ≤7 d, 113 with LOS on days 4–7, and 
20 with ≥2 of NEC, SIP, or LOS ≤7 d. ICH, intracranial hemorrhage; PDA, patent ductus arteriosus; PIE, pulmonary interstitial 
emphysema; RDS, respiratory distress syndrome; RR, relative risk; —, not applicable.
a Information was missing for survivors >7 d as follows: PDA, 2 infants; SIP, 2 infants; LOS, 2 infants; ICH and/or PVL, 13 
infants; BPD, 36 infants.
b RRs of each outcome for infants who received antibiotics for ≥5 days started within 72 h of birth versus those who 
either did not receive antibiotics within 72 h or received antibiotics for <5 d were adjusted for center, maternal race and/
or ethnicity, antenatal steroids, multiple birth, GA (categorical), BW (continuous), and sex except as noted below. Because 
of the number of centers with no infants who had the outcome (or, for RDS, centers with no infants without the outcome), 
center was not included in models assessing risk of RDS and SIP. All infants born at GA 22–24 wk had RDS; therefore, GA 
22–25 wk were combined for the purpose of assessing RDS. GAs 22 and 23 wk were combined in the models assessing 
SIP and BPD (only 1 of the 9 infants included who were born at GA 22 wk and survived >7 d had SIP before discharge; all 5 
infants born at GA 22 wk who survived to 36 wk PMA had BPD).
c PIE was collected beginning April 1, 2011.

 lower risk of EOS. Prolonged early 
antibiotics were administered to 
a large proportion of these infants 
despite their lower a priori risk, 
and this was associated with higher 
adjusted incidence of death and 
pulmonary morbidity. Recognition of 
differential EOS risk may help guide 
early empirical antibiotic use among 
approximately one-third of extremely 
preterm infants.
