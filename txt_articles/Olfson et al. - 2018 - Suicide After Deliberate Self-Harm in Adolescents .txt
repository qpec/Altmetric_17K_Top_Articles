OBJECTIVES: Among adolescents and young adults with nonfatal self-harm, our objective is to 
identify risk factors for repeated nonfatal self-harm and suicide death over the following 
year.
METHODS: A national cohort of patients in the Medicaid program, aged 12 to 24 years  
(n = 32 395), was followed for up to 1 year after self-harm. Cause of death information 
was obtained from the National Death Index. Repeat self-harm per 1000 person-years 
and suicide deaths per 100 000 person-years were determined. Hazard ratios (HRs) of 
repeat self-harm and suicide were estimated by Cox proportional hazard models. Suicide 
standardized mortality rate ratios were derived by comparison with demographically 
matched general population controls.
RESULTS: The 12-month suicide standardized mortality rate ratio after self-harm was 
significantly higher for adolescents (46.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 29.9–67.9) than 
young adults (19.2, 95% CI: 12.7–28.0). Hazards of suicide after self-harm were significantly 
higher for American Indians and Alaskan natives than non-Hispanic white patients  
(HR: 4.69, 95% CI: 2.41–9.13) and for self-harm patients who initially used violent methods 
(HR: 18.04, 95% CI: 9.92–32.80), especially firearms (HR: 35.73, 95% CI: 15.42–82.79), 
compared with nonviolent self-harm methods (1.00, reference). The hazards of repeat  
self-harm were higher for female subjects than male subjects (HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.18–1.33); 
patients with personality disorders (HR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.42–1.69); and patients whose 
initial self-harm was treated in an inpatient setting (HR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.49–1.83)  
compared with an emergency department (HR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.55–0.69) or outpatient 
(1.00, reference) setting.
CONCLUSIONS: After nonfatal self-harm, adolescents and young adults were at markedly 
elevated risk of suicide. Among these high-risk patients, those who used violent self-harm 
methods, particularly firearms, were at especially high risk underscoring the importance of 
follow-up care to help ensure their safety.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Although nonfatal 
self-harm is common among young people and suicide is 
a leading cause of death among adolescents and young 
adults, little is known about the rate and risks of suicide 
after nonfatal self-harm in young people.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: After self-harm, adolescents and 
young adults were at markedly increased risk of suicide, 
including especially those who initially used violent self-
harm methods or were of American Indian or Alaskan native 
descent. These risks highlight the importance of close 
follow-up after self-harm events.

 Nonfatal self-harm, which may 
involve varying degrees of suicidal 
intent, is common in young people, 
1  
and suicide is the second leading 
cause of death in the United States 
among people ages 15 to 24 years.2 
Because nearly one-third of young 
people who die of suicide have 
nonfatal self-harm events during the 
last 3 months of life, 
3 self-harm may 
offer opportunities for potentially 
life-saving interventions.
In contrast to suicide attempts, which 
require suicidal intent, self-harm 
refers to nonfatal self-poisoning or 
self-injury with or without suicidal 
intent.4 After self-harm, adolescents 
are at risk for repeat self-harm and 
suicide.5 An important challenge is to 
assess suicide risk after nonfatal self-
harm. The authors of three previous 
cohort studies have evaluated suicide 
risk during the first year after self-
harm in young people. The authors 
of a UK study, who followed 5414 
patients ages 10 to 24 years after 
self-harm, reported that 0.3%  
(n = 15) died of suicide in the first 
follow-up year.6 More recently, the 
authors of a Swedish study of 8387 
self-harm patients ages 10 to 19 
years reported that 0.16% (n = 13) 
died by suicide in the first year.7 The 
authors of a recent Canadian study, 
who followed 20 471 adolescents 
after emergency department 
treatment of self-poisoning, reported 
that their hazard of suicide during 
the first follow-up year was 32.1 
times greater than matched controls.8 
In the current study, we extend this 
line of research to a large US sample 
of Medicaid-insured young people 
after nonfatal self-harm.
Repetition of self-harm is also 
clinically important because it is 
associated with an increased risk 
of suicide, 
9 indicates persistent 
distress, and places demands 
on health care resources.10 Risk 
factors for repeated self-harm in 
young people include a history of 
previous self-harm, 
11, 
 
12 previous 
mental health treatment, 
13 a violent 
method of self-harm, 
14 and specific 
psychiatric disorders including 
depression, 
15 
– 
20 substance use 
disorders, 
11, 
 
15, 
21, 
 
22 anxiety  
disorders, 
11, 
 
15, 
 
16 schizophrenia, 
16, 
 
22  
attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD), 
16, 
 
22 and 
personality disorders.16, 
20  
Because of variation in study 
samples and designs, however,  
the relative strength of these  
patient characteristics on risk  
of repeat self-harm remains  
poorly defined.
Age-related changes in cognitive, 
affective, social, behavioral, and 
biological vulnerabilities may 
influence initiation and persistence 
of psychopathology through 
adolescence and young adulthood.23, 
 
24  
However, little is known about 
whether and how adolescents and 
young adults vary in their risks of 
repeated self-harm and suicide after 
self-harm. To address these issues, 
we compared adolescents and young 
adults with respect to these risks 
after self-harm. In accordance with 
overall suicide risk, 
25 we anticipated 
that older age, male sex, and  
non-Hispanic white race and/or  
ethnicity would be related to 
increased suicide risk after  
self-harm.
METHODS
Sources of Data
A self-harm cohort was extracted 
from 2001 to 2007 national (45 
states, not including AZ, DE, NV,  
OR, or RI) Medicaid Analytic Extract 
data, which includes claims records 
for Medicaid-financed services and 
medications. Dates and cause of 
death information were derived from 
linkage to the National Death Index, 
which is the most complete resource 
available for tracing mortality in 
national samples.26 US population 
death rates in 2001–2007 were 
derived from the National Center for 
Health Statistics.25 This project was 
approved by the Rutgers University 
Institutional Review Board.
Self-Harm Cohort Assembly
The cohort was restricted to 
individuals 12 to 24 years of age with 
clinical diagnoses of deliberate self-
harm (International Classification 
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical 
Modification codes E950–E958). 
Patients were also required to be 
eligible for Medicaid services during 
the 180 days preceding their index 
self-harm event.
The first eligible instance of self-
harm was selected, and no patient 
contributed more than 1 observation. 
The cohort was followed forward 
from their index self-harm until the 
end of a 365-day follow-up period, 
date of death, or end of available 
data, whichever came first. For 
self-harms treated in outpatient or 
emergency department settings, the 
index date was the date of self-harm 
treatment. For self-harms treated in 
inpatient settings, the index date was 
the hospital discharge date.27
Outcomes
Following the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, suicide was 
defined as International Classification 
of Diseases, 10th Revision codes X60–
X84, Y87.0, or U03 as the immediate 
cause of death.28 The primary 
outcomes of interest were repeat, 
nonfatal self-harm and suicide 
deaths. Suicide deaths coinciding 
with the index self-harm were not 
included in the analyses. Secondary 
outcomes included all causes of death 
and death due to accidents (V01–X59, 
Y85–Y86).
Sociodemographic and Clinical 
Characteristics
On the basis of Medicaid  
eligibility data, cohort members  
were classified by age at time of  
the index self-harm as adolescents 
(12–17 years) or young adults  
(18–24 years), sex, and race and/or

 ethnicity: white, non-Hispanic; 
African American, non-Hispanic; 
Hispanic; American Indian or Alaskan 
native; and “other” including Asian 
Americans, Native Hawaiians or 
other Pacific Islanders, and more 
than 1 race. Cohort members were 
also classified by geographic region 
(west, midwest, south, northeast), 
and Medicaid eligibility status 
(disability, foster care, low income, or 
other).
Variables representing clinical 
diagnoses on or within 180 days 
before the index self-harm were 
defined for ADHD, disruptive 
behavior disorders, depressive 
disorders, bipolar disorder, anxiety 
disorders, schizophrenia and 
related psychoses, substance use 
disorders, personality disorders, 
and a residual group of other mental 
disorders (Supplemental Table 6). 
At least 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient 
diagnoses defined each mental 
disorder group.29 In analysis of these 
diagnostic groups, comparators 
were self-harm patients without 
the disorder of interest. A separate 
variable defined the number of 
mental health diagnostic groups (0, 
1, 2, 3+). Separate variables defined 
any inpatient and outpatient mental 
health care and any outpatient care 
during the 180 days preceding the 
self-harm event.
Place of service codes were used to 
classify the index self-harm treatment 
setting hierarchically as (1) inpatient, 
(2) emergency department, or 
(3) outpatient for those receiving 
care in >1 setting. Index self-harm 
method was classified as violent, 
nonviolent, and other methods 
with external cause of injury codes 
(E-codes). Nonviolent methods were 
subclassified as cutting, poisoning, 
or other methods. Violent methods 
included firearms and other violent 
methods (drowning, hanging and 
suffocation, jumping from heights, 
motor vehicle or aircraft crashing, 
fire and scalding, and extreme cold) 
(Supplemental Table 6).30, 
 
31
Analysis
Adolescents and young adults 
who were treated for nonfatal 
self-harm were compared with 
respect to demographic and 
clinical characteristics. For each 
demographic and clinical variable 
stratum, we determined the number 
of patients, person years of follow-up, 
number with ≥1 repeat self-harm 
events, and first repeat self-harm 
rates per 1000 person-years. 
Corresponding stratified rates of 
suicide risk per 100 000 person-years 
of follow-up were determined. For

Downloaded from 
 self-harm patients who survived the 
initial event, Cox proportional hazard 
models, which make no assumptions 
about the baseline hazard, estimated 
unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 
repeat self-harm during follow-up 
with each stratification variable as 
the independent variable of interest. 
Adjusted Cox models controlled 
for age, sex, race and/or ethnicity, 
geographic region, and Medicaid 
eligibility status. Separate models 
were fit for adolescents and young 
adults. Models also included an 
interaction term (stratification 
variable by age group) to assess 
differences in repeat self-harm risk 
across the 2 age groups.

 For comparison of suicide rates of the 
self-harm cohort with US population 
suicide rates, we determined the 
matched age group, sex, and race 
and/or ethnicity in the US population 
annual mean suicide rates for 
2001–2007. All statistical analyses 
were performed with SAS 9.4 (SAS 
Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Patients With Nonfatal Initial Self-
Harm Events
A total of 32 437 self-harm events 
were observed. Forty-two (0.13%) 
were fatal (suicide), including 20 
adolescents and 22 young adults, and 
excluded from the prospective cohort 
(n = 32 395).
Most patients with nonfatal initial 
self-harm were white, adolescents, 
female subjects, and their events 
involved poisoning (Table 1). 
Depression and substance use 
disorders were the most commonly 
diagnosed mental disorders within 
the 180 days preceding self-harm. 
Approximately half of the patients 
with self-harm were treated in 
emergency departments, whereas 
22.5% involved inpatient admission. 
As compared with adolescent self-
harm patients, young adult self-
harm patients were more likely to 
have been diagnosed with substance 
use disorders, personality disorders, 
or schizophrenia and related 
psychoses and less likely to have 
been diagnosed with ADHD, other 
disruptive behavioral disorders, 
or depression in the 180 days 
before self-harm. Approximately 
half of each age group received any 
outpatient mental health care during 
this period.
One-Year Repeated Nonfatal 
Self-Harm
Approximately 17.1% (5545 of 
32 395) of the self-harm patients had 
repeated nonfatal self-harm during 
the follow-up year for an unadjusted 
repeat self-harm rate of 222.7 per 
1000 person-years (Table 2). The 
cumulative probability of first self-
harm distributions were similar for 
adolescents and young adults, with 
both having a steep rise in the first 
few days after the initial event and 
then rising more gradually (Fig 1).
The unadjusted hazards of repeat 
nonfatal self-harm were higher for 
young adults than adolescents, female 
than male patients, and white than 
African American or Hispanic patients, 
although the age group difference 
was not evident in the adjusted 
model. Recent clinical diagnoses of 
each specific mental disorder other 
than ADHD were also associated with 
significantly increased hazards of 
repeated self-harm. The hazards also 
increased with increasing number of 
mental disorders. The risk of repeat 
self-harm was significantly higher 
for patients treated for personality 
or anxiety disorders than depressive 
disorders. Self-harm events that 
involved poisoning or that were 
treated in inpatient settings were 
also associated with increased risk of 
repeated self-harm.
There were few differences between 
adolescents and young adults in 
risk factors of repeated self-harm. 
However, female sex, Hispanic 
ethnicity, and treatment of the initial 
self-harm in an inpatient setting were 
more strongly associated with repeat 
self-harm for adolescents than for 
young adults (Table 3). By contrast, 
a recent diagnosis of disruptive 
behavior disorders or schizophrenia 
and the number of mental disorder 
diagnoses were more strongly 
associated with repeat self-harm for 
young adults than adolescents.
Suicide After Nonfatal Self-Harm
The 1-year suicide standardized 
mortality rate ratio (SMR) for 
the study cohort was 26.7 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 19.9–35.1) 
compared with the matched age, 
sex, or race and/or ethnicity in the 
US general population (Table 4). 
The corresponding suicide SMR was 
significantly higher for adolescents 
(46.0, 95% CI: 29.9–67.9) than for 
young adults (19.2, 95% CI: 12.7–28.0). 
The cumulative probability of suicide 
was similar for the 2 age groups during 
the first 111 days, after which the risk 
for young adults exceeded the risk for 
adolescents (Fig 2).

nonfatal self-harm were significantly

 higher for male subjects than 
female subjects, non-Hispanic white 
than African American patients, 
and patients whose initial self-
harm involved violent rather than 
nonviolent methods (Table 5). After 
controlling for age and sex, the odds 
of suicide were more than 5 times 
higher for American Indian and 
Alaskan native self-harm patients 
than for white non-Hispanic self-
harm patients.
The adjusted hazards of suicide 
after self-harm events with violent 
methods were significantly larger for 
adolescents (28.18, 95% CI: 9.98–
80.36) than for young adults (7.44, 
95% CI: 2.90–19.08) (interaction P 
value = .04). In a post hoc analysis, 
American Indian and Alaskan native 
self-harm patients were significantly 
more likely than their white  
non-Hispanic counterparts to have 
used violent methods during their 
initial self-harm event (7.36% vs 
3.86%, P < .0001). Male self-harm 
patients were also more likely than 
female self-harm patients to use 
violent methods (7.88% vs 5.32%,  
P < .0001).
All-Causes of Deaths and Accidental 
Deaths
After self-harm, the 1-year SMR for 
all-cause mortality was significantly 
higher for young adults (10.3, 95% 
CI: 8.1–12.8) than for adolescents 
(4.1, 95% CI: 2.9–5.7) (Table 4). The  
standardized risk of accidental death  
was significantly elevated in the 
combined self-harm cohort in relation 
to matched controls (3.3, 95%  
CI: 2.2–4.8) and among the young 
adult cohort (5.0, 95% CI: 3.0–7.8) 
but not among the adolescent  
cohort (1.8, 95% CI: 0.8–3.6).
DISCUSSION
After nonfatal self-harm, adolescents 
and young adults in the Medicaid 
program were at 26.7 times higher 
risk of suicide than that of the 
demographically matched US general 
population. The standardized 
mortality rate ratio of suicide after 
self-harm was significantly higher 
for adolescents than young adults. 
Suicide risk was especially prominent 
for male subjects, individuals who 
were American Indians or Alaskan 
natives, and those whose initial 
self-harm involved violent methods,

 such as firearms or hanging. The link 
between violent initial self-harm 
method and subsequent suicide was 
stronger for adolescents than young 
adults. In the year after self-harm, 
young adults, but not adolescents, 
were also at significantly increased 
risk of dying of accidents.8
Consistent with past research, 
nonfatal self-harm was strongly 
associated with suicide during the 
first follow-up year.7, 
 
8 In a UK self-
harm cohort, suicide risk was 35 
times higher than the population 
risk for male subjects and 75 times 
higher for female subjects, 
6 whereas 
in a Swedish self-harm cohort the 
corresponding suicide risks were 
50.2 times higher for male subjects 
and 7.5 times higher for female 
subjects.7 One reason that our 
estimates of relative suicide risk tend 
to be lower than these estimates 
may be because our results included 
self-harm presenting to all settings, 
whereas the United Kingdom and 
Swedish studies involved only 
patients treated in hospitals who 
were presumably at higher risk.
Adolescents and young adults had 
roughly similar rates of suicide 
after self-harm. The diagnostic 
composition of the 2 age groups, 
including larger proportions of 
ADHD and disruptive behavior 
disorders among adolescents and 
substance use and personality 
disorders among young adults, likely 
reflects differences in ages of onset 
and clinical diagnostic practices. 
Because the general population risk 
of suicide is lower in adolescents 
than young adults, however, the 
standardized risk of suicide after 
self-harm was significantly higher 
for adolescents than young adults.  
It is possible that neuro-
developmental vulnerabilities 
during adolescence linked to the 
onset of mood and substance use 
disorders, risk-taking behaviors,  
or heightened susceptibility to 
negative social cues contribute 
to the relatively high suicide risk 
during adolescence following  
self-harm.32, 
 
33
Self-harm presented differently 
in adolescents and young adults. 
Although depression and anxiety 
diagnoses were common in both age 
groups, adolescents with self-harm 
were far more likely to have been 
recently diagnosed with ADHD and 
other disruptive behaviors, whereas 
young adults more commonly had 
substance use and personality 
disorder diagnoses. Similar age-
related patterns have been reported 
among young people who received

The risk of repeated self-harm during 
the first follow-up year was over 
100 times greater than the risk of 
suicide. High recurrence of self-harm 
underscores persistence of self-
injurious behaviors in this age group. 
Consistent with previous research, 
38 
several clinical diagnoses including 
personality, anxiety, mood, substance 
use, schizophrenia, and disruptive 
behavior disorders were related to 
an elevated risk of repeated self-
harm. The wide distribution of risk 
across common clinical psychiatric 
diagnoses complicates prediction of 
repeated attempts. Also in line with 
previous research, 
8 patients admitted 
for inpatient care were significantly 
more likely than outpatients to have 
repeated self-harm.
Suicide risk after self-harm was ∼4 
times greater for male subjects than 
female subjects. Some potential

 explanations for the preponderance 
of suicide among male subjects 
include sex-related differences in 
mental health treatment–seeking 
behavior, 
39 self-harm methods, 
40 and 
pubertal development.41 Because 
the risk for repeated self-harm was 
greater for female subjects than male 
subjects, higher lethality of male 
than female self-harm events likely 
contributes to the preponderance 
of suicides by male subjects after 
self-harm.
Risks of suicide after self-harm 
were ∼5 times higher for white 
than African American young 
people, suggesting that self-harm 
poses a particular threat to white 
adolescents and young adults. By 
contrast, risk of repeat self-harm 
was only modestly higher for white 
than African American individuals. 
In nationally representative US 
samples, no significant differences 
have been found in the lifetime 
prevalence of suicide attempts of 
African American and white young 
adults.42, 
 
43 However, as compared 
with their African American 
counterparts, white young adults 
may have a significantly higher 
prevalence of suicidal ideation43 
as well as mood, anxiety, and 
substance use disorders.44 Greater 
exposure to these and other suicide 
risk factors may contribute to the 
relatively high suicide risk of white 
young people after self-harm.
Suicide risk after self-harm 
was particularly elevated for 
American Indian and Alaska 
Native young people, a group with 
increased suicide rates.45 These 
results underscore the need for 
suicide prevention initiatives in 
American Indian and Alaska Native 
communities. In 1 recent report, 
a multitiered suicide prevention 
program among the Apache of 
Arizona, which included efforts 
to increase identification, coping 
skills, and resilience of at-risk 
young people, coincided with a 23% 
decrease in suicide among 15- to 
24-year-olds.46
In accordance with previous 
research with adults, violent self-
harm methods posed a high risk 
for subsequent suicide.8, 
 
27, 
 
47, 
 
48 
Acquiring the capability to use 
more violent or lethal methods, 
although less common than lower 
lethality methods, may increase 
suicide risk by weakening a fear of 
death.49 Suicide risk was especially 
great after initial nonfatal self-
harm involving firearms. For 
high-risk young people with 
access to firearms, distributing 
trigger locks and urging family 
members to store firearms away 
from the patient’s home50 can be a 
lifesaving precautionary measure. 
The association between violent 
methods and subsequent suicide 
was significantly stronger for 
adolescents than young adults, 
although this interaction was  
based on a small number of suicide 
deaths and therefore requires 
replication.
This study has several limitations. 
First, claims records do not 
distinguish self-harm injuries 
with suicidal from nonsuicidal 
intent.51 Variation in suicidal intent 
may mediate risks across clinical 
groups. For example, high suicidal 
intent might partially mediate the 
association between high lethality 
self-harm methods and suicide 
risk, whereas persistently low or 
no intent (nonsuicidal self-injury) 
might mediate the association 
between personality disorders and 
repeated self-harm. Second, we 
have no means of validating mental 
disorder diagnoses in Medicaid 
claims records. Third, information 
was not available concerning 
several factors thought to increase 
suicide risk, such as hopelessness, 
problem-solving deficits, stressful 
or traumatic life events, and access 
to lethal means. Because community 
mental treatment may be more 
intensive and effective after severe 
or violent self-harm events, it may 
have reduced risks of suicide and 
repeated self-harm events. Fourth, 
misdiagnosis and perceptions  
of stigma may have introduced  
errors in coding self-harm, and  
low autopsy rates may have 
resulted in misclassification of 
cause of death.52 Fifth, claims 
records do not capture self-harm 
that does not result in medical  
care. Sixth, the data reflect  
suicide mortality patterns in  
2001–2007, which may have 
changed in recent years.  
Finally, although there are  
concerns over the validity53  
and completeness54 of E-codes  
to measure deliberate self-harm,  
a high concordance exists  
between self-harm E-codes  
and medical record documentation 
of intentional injury with suicidal 
intent.55
Adolescents and young adults  
who survive self-harm are at  
high risk for repeated self-harm 
and suicide over the following year. 
The risk of suicide was especially 
marked after nonfatal self-harm 
events that involved violent 
methods. Clinical priority should  
be given to ensuring the safety of 
young people after self-harm,  
which may include treating 
underlying psychiatric disorders, 
restricting access to lethal  
means, fortifying psychosocial 
supports, and close monitoring  
for emerging suicidal symptoms.
