Abstract: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease with vari-
able clinical manifestations. While the clearest guidelines for the treatment of SLE exist in the 
context of lupus nephritis, patients with other lupus manifestations such as neuropsychiatric, 
hematologic, musculoskeletal, and severe cutaneous lupus frequently require immunosuppres-
sion and/or biologic therapy. Conventional immunosuppressive agents such as mycophenolate 
mofetil, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide are widely used in the management of SLE with 
current more rationalized treatment regimens optimizing the use of these agents while mini-
mizing potential toxicity. The advent of biologic therapies has advanced the treatment of SLE 
particularly in patients with refractory disease. The CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab and 
the anti-BLyS agent belimumab are now widely in use in clinical practice. Several other biologic 
agents are in ongoing clinical trials. While immunosuppressive and biologic agents are the 
foundation of inflammatory disease control in SLE, the importance of managing comorbidi-
ties such as cardiovascular risk factors, bone health, and minimizing susceptibility to infection 
should not be neglected.

Introduction
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease, with variable 
clinical manifestations, that follows an unpredictable relapsing remitting course. In 
the past, the main causes of death in SLE patients were uncontrolled inflammatory 
disease activity and infection due to immunosuppression.1 While patients may still 
succumb to these complications, early atherosclerotic disease has become a major 
cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with SLE.2
It is now well recognized that cumulative organ damage, in particular renal 
damage, is an important predictor of mortality in SLE.3 Recurrent flares of disease 
activity such as lupus nephritis are associated with poor long-term outcomes.4,5 There 
remains an unmet clinical need in SLE, particularly in patients with disease refractory 
to conventional immunosuppressive therapies. Another key issue in the therapeutic 
management of SLE is the longstanding overreliance on corticosteroid therapy which 
contributes substantially to damage accrual and patient mortality. In this review, we 
focus on therapeutic advances in the management of SLE with a discussion of recent 
optimizations in the use of established immunosuppressive therapies and an overview 
of new biologic agents.

Conventional immunosuppressive 
agents in the management of SLE
Induction and maintenance therapies  
in lupus nephritis
Immunosuppressive treatment of lupus nephritis is divided 
into induction and maintenance phases. There are a number 
of existing guidelines for the treatment of lupus nephritis 
including the American College of Rheumatology and Euro-
pean League Against Rheumatism guidelines, which are in 
agreement on some areas of lupus nephritis management, 
but differ in others.6,7
The aims of induction therapy in lupus nephritis are to ini-
tiate immunosuppressive therapy without delay and achieve 
remission of renal disease in terms of proteinuria and renal 
function as promptly as possible. Definitions of partial and 
complete renal response vary somewhat in different treatment 
guidelines and as endpoints in clinical trials.
The aims of maintenance therapy in lupus nephritis are 
consolidation of renal response achieved during induction 
therapy, prevention of disease flares, and prompt identification 
of disease relapse, ultimately leading to long-term preserva-
tion of renal function. There are no data to guide the appro-
priate duration of maintenance therapy beyond 3 years and 
hence treatment should be tailored to the individual patient. 
Ideally, corticosteroid should be tapered and when possible 
withdrawn before immunosuppression is tapered. In both the 
induction and maintenance phases of lupus nephritis manage-
ment, avoidance of treatment-related toxicity is essential for 
improved quality of life and patient survival.
The main therapeutic options for induction therapy of 
lupus nephritis are mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and 
cyclophosphamide (CYC), which are generally given with 
concurrent corticosteroid therapy. MMF and CYC are consid-
ered equivalent in terms of efficacy and frequency of adverse 
events based on clinical trials.8–10 Unlike CYC, MMF does not 
adversely affect fertility, although both agents are absolutely 
contraindicated in pregnancy due to teratogenicity. Patients 
of different ancestral backgrounds may respond differently 
to therapy with evidence that African and Hispanic lupus 
nephritis patients respond less well to intravenous CYC than 
Caucasian or Asian patients, thus MMF may be a more prefer-
able choice for induction therapy in these groups.8,11,12
It should be noted that the response to treatment with 
MMF versus CYC seems to be very dependent upon the 
treatment center. Some centers have consistently good results 
with MMF but poor results with CYC, while the opposite 
holds true in other centers. Some physicians adjust the CYC 
dose according to the trough white cell count 10–14 days 
after the infusion to ensure that the therapeutic benefit of 
the drug is achieved.
There are two widely used regimens of intravenous 
CYC as induction therapy for lupus nephritis; the low-dose 
Eurolupus regimen (500 mg once fortnightly for 3 months), 
and the high-dose NIH regimen (500–1,000 mg/m2 intrave-
nously monthly for 6 months).13–15 The long-term results of 
these CYC regimens are comparable in terms of safety and 
efficacy.16–18 The Eurolupus regimen may be preferable in 
patients of European ancestry.
The main choices for maintenance therapy in lupus 
nephritis are azathioprine (AZA) or MMF, which have been 
shown to have similar efficacy and frequency of adverse 
events in clinical trials, although one large study showed 
superiority of MMF over AZA.13,16,19 As part of the decision-
making process as to which maintenance therapy to use, the 
patients’ future desire to become pregnant must be considered 
as MMF is known to be teratogenic whereas AZA is widely 
used in pregnancy.20 The optimal duration of maintenance 
therapy in lupus nephritis before tapering or withdrawal is 
as yet unknown and is currently at the treating physician’s 
discretion.
Calcineurin inhibitors may provide a useful adjunctive 
therapy in lupus nephritis. A recent Chinese study comparing 
MMF in combination with tacrolimus was proven to be superior 
to intravenous CYC in terms of achieving complete renal remis-
sion.21 In a previous study, tacrolimus was found to be noninfe-
rior to MMF when combined with prednisolone for induction 
therapy of active lupus nephritis.22 When followed by AZA 
maintenance for 5 years, a trend toward higher incidence of 
renal flares and decline in renal function was observed in those 
who received tacrolimus induction therapy.23 Tacrolimus may be 
particularly useful as adjunctive therapy in patients with persis-
tent proteinuria despite other therapies, and in the management 
of lupus nephritis in pregnancy.24
Immunosuppression in nonrenal lupus
Neuropsychiatric lupus
The approach to the management of neuropsychiatric 
lupus depends on the underlying etiology which may be 
inflammatory, thromboembolic, or neurotoxic in origin. 
Clinical manifestations such as cerebral vasculitis, aseptic 
meningitis, optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, refractory 
seizures, acute confusional state, and psychosis are fre-
quently driven by inflammation and may be managed with 
immunosuppression. Unlike lupus nephritis, there is a

Current treatment options for SLe
paucity of randomized controlled trials in neuropsychiatric 
lupus given the heterogeneity of clinical manifestations and 
lack of standardization of outcome measures. In 2010, the 
European League Against Rheumatism published recom-
mendations for the management of neuropsychiatric mani-
festations in SLE.25 On the basis of published case series, 
one nonrandomized clinical trial, and numerous case reports, 
intravenous CYC is the treatment of choice for severe 
neuropsychiatric lupus manifestations.26–33 Similar to lupus 
nephritis, AZA and MMF are frequently used as maintenance 
therapies for neuropsychiatric lupus.34,35
Inflammatory arthritis and myositis related to lupus
Hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids remain first-line 
therapies for musculoskeletal manifestations of SLE; 
however, patients with severe inflammatory arthritis and 
myositis may require further management with immuno-
suppressive or biologic agents for inflammatory disease 
control.
Methotrexate (MTX), which is the disease-modifying 
therapy of choice in rheumatoid arthritis, has been shown 
to be effective in controlling inflammatory arthritis related 
to lupus in clinical trials, case series, and several case 
reports.36–39 In patients unable to tolerate MTX, leflunomide 
may be considered for treatment of inflammatory arthritis 
related to lupus.40,41 MMF and to a lesser degree AZA have 
shown efficacy in the treatment of inflammatory myositis 
in SLE patients and have demonstrated a steroid sparing 
effect.42–44 In severe lupus-related inflammatory myositis 
refractory to corticosteroids and other immunosuppression, 
intravenous CYC has been used with some success.42,45
Severe cutaneous lupus
Severe cutaneous lupus may present as acute, subacute lupus 
erythematosus, discoid lupus erythematosus, lupus pannicu-
litis, and lupus cutaneous vasculitis. Topical corticosteroids 
and immunomodulators such as topical tacrolimus and 
pimecrolimus, antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine or 
mepacrine, and corticosteroids remain first-line therapies.
A number of randomized controlled trials and case series 
have shown the effectiveness of MTX in managing severe 
cutaneous lupus at doses ranging from MTX 10 to 25 mg 
per week.46–49 Both AZA and MMF have been used to good 
effect in cases of recalcitrant cutaneous lupus.50–54
Dapsone, an immunomodulatory agent, has been shown 
to be effective in a number of cutaneous lupus forms includ-
ing bullous lupus erythematosus, lupus panniculitis, subacute 
lupus erythematosus, and discoid lupus erythematosus.55 
Dapsone can cause dose-related hemolysis and patients 
should be screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 
deficiency prior to commencing this medication.
Thalidomide has also been used with some success in 
the treatment of cutaneous lupus.56 Thalidomide is known 
to be teratogenic and hence female patients of childbearing 
age need to be taking an effective form of contraception 
while on this medication.
Biologic therapies, particularly rituximab and belimumab, 
have shown good promise in treating cutaneous lupus unre-
sponsive to conventional immunosuppression and will be 
discussed in detail further on in this review.
Severe hematologic manifestations of SLe
Immune-mediated cytopenias such as thrombocytopenia, 
leucopenia, and hemolytic anemia frequently occur in lupus 
patients. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents 
may be prescribed to manage these hematological manifesta-
tions of SLE. AZA and MMF have both been used to good 
effect in severe refractory lupus-related thrombocytopenia, 
leucopenia, and hemolytic anemia, with a steroid-sparing 
effect.57,58 Intravenous CYC has been used with success in 
the treatment of autoimmune thrombocytopenia unrespon-
sive to standard treatment.59,60 Intravenous immunoglobulin 
has been shown to have a good therapeutic response in SLE 
patients with hematologic manifestations such as autoim-
mune thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia.61,62 Biologic 
agents particularly rituximab have been used in refractory 
cases of hematologic lupus. The BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 
Phase III trials of belimumab in SLE have shown efficacy 
in treating hematologic manifestations of SLE and will be 
discussed in detail later in this review.
The advent of biologic therapies  
in the management of SLE
In recent years, an increased understanding of the etiopatho-
genesis of SLE has led to the introduction of a number of 
biologic agents that specifically target disease pathways 
underlying the development and progression of lupus. These 
biologic agents can be broadly categorized into those directed 
at B-cells and non-B-cell targets. Some of these therapies 
such as rituximab and belimumab have entered the realm of 
clinical practice while others are in ongoing clinical trials.
B-cell depletion with rituximab
Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody which 
selectively targets B-cells with the surface marker CD20. 
Rituximab is widely used for the treatment of SLE in clinical

practice but remains unlicensed. It has been found to be 
particularly useful in SLE patients with recalcitrant disease 
including renal, hematologic, and cutaneous manifestations. 
A number of published case series and open label trials of 
rituximab in SLE patients have demonstrated beneficial results 
in these areas.63–67 However, it is unclear whether rituximab 
is exclusively working via B-cell depletion, as it may have 
additional effects via binding of Fc gamma receptor IIB on 
B-cells and macrophages, thus inhibiting their activation.
A significant setback to the more widespread accep-
tance of rituximab in the treatment of SLE was the failure 
of two pivotal randomized controlled trials. Both the 
EXPLORER study of rituximab in nonrenal SLE and the 
LUNAR study in lupus nephritis failed to achieve their 
primary endpoints.68,69 On a more positive note, a recent 
prospective observational study of rituximab as part of a 
corticosteroid sparing regimen in lupus nephritis has shown 
encouraging results.70
Clinical experience to date has found rituximab to be gener-
ally safe and well tolerated. However, infusion reactions, aller-
gic or anaphylactic reactions, severe or recurrent infections, 
and progressive multifocal leuco-encephalopathy have been 
reported in rituximab-treated SLE patients (Table 1).71,72
Targeting B-cell survival with belimumab
B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), also known as B-cell acti-
vating factor (BAFF), and a proliferation-inducing ligand 
(APRIL) are members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 
ligand superfamily and play key roles in the regulation of 
B-cell proliferation, differentiation, and immunoglobulin 
secretion.77,78 BLyS exists in both membrane bound and 
soluble forms and is expressed by cells of the innate immune

system such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. 
BLyS can bind to three receptors, all of which are expressed 
by B-cells, including TNF transmembrane activator and 
calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI), 
B lymphocyte maturation antigen (BCMA), and BAFF/BLyS 
receptor 3 (BR3).79,80 Plasma and peripheral blood leukocyte 
mRNA BLyS levels have been shown to correlate with disease 
activity and autoantibody levels in SLE patients.81,83
Belimumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting BLyS 
that has been shown to be safe and efficacious in two large 
randomized controlled trials in SLE, the Belimumab Inter-
national SLE Studies, BLISS-52, and BLISS-76.84,85 Both 
of these studies excluded SLE patients with active lupus 
nephritis or neuropsychiatric disease.
A post hoc analysis of the organ domain scores combining 
both BLISS studies showed that clinical improvement with 
belimumab treatment was most evident in musculoskeletal 
and mucocutaneous domains. Less worsening of disease 
activity with belimumab therapy was seen in hematologic, 
immunological, and renal domains.86 Another pooled post hoc 
analysis was performed of the BLISS studies to determine the 
effect of belimumab on patients with renal involvement and 
showed that those receiving MMF, or those with serologic 
activity at baseline, had a greater improvement in renal dis-
ease with belimumab than with placebo.87 In a further post 
hoc analysis of the BLISS trials, greater clinical efficacy with 
belimumab was seen in SLE patients who were serologi-
cally more active and had higher clinical disease activity as 
defined as SELENA-SLEDAI (Safety of Estrogens in Lupus 
Erythematosus National Assessment) (Systemic Lupus Ery-
thematosus Disease Activity Index) .10.88
On the basis of the BLISS clinical trial results, the US 
Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines 
Agency approved belimumab (10 mg/kg) for use in addition 
to standard of care in autoantibody positive SLE patients with 
moderate-to-severe disease activity, with the exception of 
those with active lupus nephritis or neuropsychiatric lupus.
Safety and tolerability data following 7 years of beli-
mumab patient exposure have been published showing that the 
most common adverse events reported were mild-to-moderate 
infections particularly upper respiratory tract infections.89 One 
case of progressive multifocal leuco-encephalopathy has been 
reported to date in a belimumab-treated SLE patient.90
Therapies targeting T
-B lymphocyte 
interactions with abatacept
Immunological tolerance may be induced by the blockade 
of costimulatory interactions between T- and B-cells. CD28 
is a T-cell costimulatory ligand that interacts with the recep-
tors B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86). CTLA4 on activated 
T-cells interacts with B7 with greater affinity than CD28 
resulting in a negative feedback loop that inhibits T-cell 
activation.95–97 Abatacept is a fusion protein comprised of 
CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen) combined with 
the Fc portion of human IgG1 (CTLA-4-Ig). CTLA-4-Ig has 
been shown to slow progression of lupus nephritis in murine 
models of disease.98–100 Clinical trials of abatacept in SLE 
are summarized in Table 2.

Targeting type I interferon in SLe
The type I interferon family plays a key role in innate immu-
nity and host viral defense. It is well established that SLE 
patients have high serum levels of interferon-α which corre-
late with disease activity.104–106 In addition, SLE patients have 
an interferon gene expression signature in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells, particularly in the early stages of their 
disease course.107,108 A number of anti-interferon-α therapies 
have been investigated in SLE patients with promising results 
and these clinical studies are outlined in Table 2. It should be 
noted that to date the main finding in SLE patients treated 
with anti-interferon-α therapies has been a decrease in the 
interferon gene expression signature and clinical response to 
these agents has yet to be fully determined. Phase III studies 
are now planned to investigate this further.
Adjunctive therapies in SLE
While immunosuppressive and biologic agents are the cor-
nerstone of inflammatory disease management in SLE, the 
importance of managing comorbidities such as cardiovascu-
lar risk factors, bone health, and minimizing susceptibility 
to infection should not be neglected.
The role of antimalarials in SLe
Hydroxychloroquine, while most ostensibly used in the symp-
tomatic treatment of musculoskeletal and cutaneous features 
of SLE, has a plethora of unseen beneficial effects. Low serum 
levels of hydroxychloroquine, suggesting poor medication 
adherence, have been found to be predictive of disease flares 
in SLE patients.123 Furthermore, SLE patients with quiescent 
disease who are taking hydroxychloroquine are less likely 
to have a clinical flare if they are maintained on the drug.124 
Hydroxychloroquine usage is associated with a reduced risk of 
damage accrual in SLE patients and has a protective effect on 
renal damage.125,126 In addition, hydroxychloroquine has been 
shown to have a beneficial effect on patient survival.127
Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to have a posi-
tive effect on lipid profiles in SLE patients with significant 
reductions in total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, and 
triglycerides and significant increases in high density lipo-
protein levels.128–130 Hydroxychloroquine may also play a 
role in reducing cardiovascular and thrombotic risk in SLE 
patients.131–133 Both current and past use of hydroxychloro-
quine have been associated with a beneficial effect on bone 
mineral density, with higher mean bone mineral density of 
the spine and the hip.134,135
Patients receiving hydroxychloroquine are at risk of 
developing retinopathy. While this complication is rare, it is 
recommended that patients have a baseline eye visual field 
examination. Thereafter, in low risk patients, no further 
testing is required for the next 5 years. After the first 5 years 
of therapy, an annual eye examination is recommended. In 
high risk patients, those with macular degeneration, retinal 
dystrophy, or greater than 5 year’s duration of hydroxychloro-
quine therapy, yearly eye examinations are recommended.136 
Patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment are at greater 
risk of toxicity related to hydroxychloroquine due to reduced 
clearance of the drug and dose adjustment should be consid-
ered in such individuals.
Managing cardiovascular risk in SLe
Atherosclerosis has become a leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality in SLE patients. The risk of cerebrovascular and 
coronary heart disease-related events is 5–10 times higher in 
those with SLE as compared to the normal population.137–140 
SLE patients are known to have an increased prevalence of 
cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and dys-
lipidemia, and often tend to have a sedentary lifestyle.137–142 
Furthermore, SLE patients frequently receive corticosteroid 
therapy which may exacerbate their cardiovascular risk 
factors. In addition to an excess of traditional risk factors, 
it has been established that SLE patients have an inherent 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease and premature 
atherosclerosis.143–145
Cardiovascular risk factors in SLE patients should ideally 
be assessed at baseline and during follow-up on an annual 
basis and should include a smoking assessment, review 
of vascular events (cerebral/cardiovascular), and levels 
of physical activity, and family history of cardiovascular 
disease. Lipid profile, glucose, and blood pressure should 
be monitored and treated accordingly. All patients with SLE 
should have antiphospholipid antibody markers measured at 
diagnosis and confirmatory testing at least 12 weeks later per-
formed if the baseline tests are positive. Those on long-term 
corticosteroids may require more frequent monitoring.146
Minimizing infection risk in SLe
Patients with SLE are at high risk of infections both as a 
consequence of their disease and the infection therapies used 
in their clinical management. The administration of inacti-
vated vaccines, particularly the inactivated influenza vaccine 
and the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine, is 
strongly encouraged in SLE patients on immunosuppression. 
Vaccines should ideally be given before commencing B-cell 
depleting therapy such as rituximab, or at least 6 months 
after the start of therapy but 4 weeks before the next course.

Current treatment options for SLe
Live attenuated vaccines should be avoided in immunosup-
pressed patients.147
Bone health in SLe
The prevalence of osteoporosis in SLE varies from 4% to 
24% and vertebral fracture prevalence ranges between 7.6% 
and 37%.148,149 Several factors may contribute to reduced bone 
mineral density in a patient with SLE including persistently 
active disease and chronic inflammation, reduced physical 
activity, vitamin D deficiency, ovarian failure, and renal 
failure.150 With this in mind, all patients with SLE should 
be assessed for adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and 
supplemented if necessary. Existing guidelines for the treat-
ment and prevention of osteoporosis should be followed for 
postmenopausal women and those on corticosteroids.
Conclusion
The management of SLE has progressed enormously in the 
last 10 years and we are now in the era of biologic therapies 
for this complex disease. While there are currently two such 
agents available in some developed countries (belimumab 
and rituximab), intensive efforts are underway to develop 
further biologic therapies to address a major unmet need in 
patients refractory to conventional therapies. Funding for 
these therapies remains a major limitation to availability for 
patients. For example, while belimumab is widely used in 
North America, its use has been limited on the grounds of 
cost-effectiveness in many European countries.
The indications for the use of B-cell depletion therapies 
remain uncertain and they are currently used in patients with 
very active disease who have failed one or more immunosup-
pressive therapies. However, as in rheumatoid arthritis, there 
may be a case for introducing biologic therapies very early in 
the disease course to prevent disease progression and dam-
age accumulation. Selecting appropriate patients for biologic 
therapies is very challenging and, unless done accurately, 
risks over treating patients who could have responded well 
to conventional approaches.
Designing and delivering clinical trials in SLE remains 
exceptionally challenging given the complexity of the dis-
ease, the variability of clinical features between patients, 
and the high usage of concomitant corticosteroids and 
effective immunosuppressive therapies. Other challenges 
include defining outcome measures for clinical trials – 
the choice of outcome can make or break a clinical trial 
as demonstrated in lupus nephritis.102,103 There have been 
∼20 industry led trials of 16 molecules in patients with 
SLE, with only two successful studies (BLISS-52 and 
BLISS-76). Nevertheless, several ongoing studies have 
been outlined in this review with some grounds for cau-
tious optimism.
Biosimilar monoclonal antibodies are becoming available. 
The US patent for rituximab expires in 2016 and the European 
patent expired in 2013. There are at least 20 pharmaceutical 
companies investigating rituximab biosimilars in rheumatoid 
arthritis and lymphoma and many of these studies are direct 
comparisons with MabThera/Rituxan branded rituximab. To 
our knowledge, there are no studies of biosimilar rituximab 
molecules in SLE.
Overreliance on corticosteroid therapy remains an impor-
tant issue in the management of SLE and contributes sig-
nificantly to cardiovascular risk, long-term damage accrual, 
and mortality.151 A recent prospective observational study 
of rituximab as part of a corticosteroid sparing regimen in 
lupus nephritis patients has shown encouraging results.70 
The RITUXILUP multicenter randomized controlled trial 
of rituximab and MMF with limited corticosteroid for the 
treatment of lupus nephritis is ongoing.
Hydroxychloroquine use remains the first-line agent in 
the treatment of SLE and evidence continues to accumulate 
attesting to its benefits in improving morbidity and mortality. 
Equally important is the fundamental need for each patient 
to participate in a chronic disease management program to 
minimize comorbidities such as infection, cardiovascular 
risks, bone health, and the detection and early management 
of disease flares to limit damage accumulation.
