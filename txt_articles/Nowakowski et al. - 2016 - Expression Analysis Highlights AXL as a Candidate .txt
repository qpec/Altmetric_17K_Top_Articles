In Brief
The recent outbreak of Zika virus and the
association with fetal abnormalities
including microcephaly represents a
global health emergency. Kriegstein and
colleagues survey the expression of
candidate Zika virus entry proteins to
suggest that high AXL expression in
neural stem cells may render this
population selectively vulnerable to viral
infection.

SUMMARY
The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Brazil has
been linked to substantial increases in fetal abnor-
malities and microcephaly. However, information
about the underlying molecular and cellular mecha-
nisms connecting viral infection to these defects re-
mains limited. In this study we have examined the
expression of receptors implicated in cell entry of
several enveloped viruses including ZIKV across
diverse cell types in the developing brain. Using sin-
gle-cell RNA-seq and immunohistochemistry, we
found that the candidate viral entry receptor AXL is
highly expressed by human radial glial cells, astro-
cytes, endothelial cells, and microglia in developing
human cortex and by progenitor cells in developing
retina. We also show that AXL expression in radial
glia is conserved in developing mouse and ferret cor-
tex and in human stem cell-derived cerebral organ-
oids, highlighting multiple experimental systems
that could be applied to study mechanisms of ZIKV
infectivity and effects on brain development.
In February 2016, the World Health Organization declared the
2015 outbreak of the Zika virus (ZIKV) in Central and South Amer-
ica a global health emergency (Heymann et al., 2016) following a
strong correlation between cases of ZIKV infection and a dra-
matic increase in microcephaly cases in Brazil (Oliveira Melo
et al., 2016; Schuler-Faccini et al., 2016). Subsequent reports
have now established the ability of ZIKV to cross the human
fetal-placental barrier to infect the developing central nervous
system (Calvet et al., 2016; Martines et al., 2016; Mlakar et al.,
2016). The neurotropism and neurovirulence of ZIKV has been
appreciated in model systems since the earliest description of
the virus (Bell et al., 1971; Dick, 1952; Dick et al., 1952), but it
has only recently been described in human neural stem and
progenitor cells using in vitro systems (Tang et al., 2016; P.P.

Delvecchio, J.M. Nascimento, R. Brindeiro, A. Tanuri, and S.K.
Rehen, 2016, PeerJ, preprint). Although pathology data is
currently limited, the first imaging studies and cases with
confirmed ZIKV infection in the prenatal brain showed devas-
tating consequences, including severe microcephaly, lissence-
phaly, hydrocephaly, necrosis, periventricular and cortical calci-
fication, diffuse astrogliosis, and activated microglia (Mlakar
et al., 2016, Schuler-Faccini et al., 2016). The findings of massive
cell death and necrosis reflect a far more destructive process
than occurs in many genetic forms of microcephaly.
Primary microcephaly is thought to result from a depletion of
the founder population of radial glia, the neural stem cells in
developing brain, either through cell death or premature differen-
tiation (Barkovich et al., 2012). Infrequent cases of neurodevelop-
mental brain malformations including microcephaly have been
reported in association with viral infections, including cytomega-
lovirus (CMV), rubella virus, West Nile Virus, HIV, herpes simplex,
and chikungunya (Ahlfors et al., 1986; Ge
´ rardin et al., 2014; Lanari
et al., 2012; Nakao and Chiba, 1970; O’Leary et al., 2006; Sinha
et al., 1972; Teissier et al., 2014; von der Hagen et al., 2014). Of
the few viruses known to cross the placental barrier, CMV infec-
tion causes similar neurodevelopmental brain abnormalities to
those caused by ZIKV (Conboy et al., 1986; Fowler et al., 1992;
Teissier et al., 2014). CMV neuroinvasiveness is mediated by a
variety of entry factors, including integrins and EGFR, which are
highly expressed by radial glia, a neural stem cell population.
Higher expression of these entry proteins determines the initial
susceptible cell population (Kawasaki et al., 2015).
Based on the role of neural stem cells in other forms of micro-
cephaly, we hypothesized that human radial glia may selectively
express proteins promoting ZIKV entry and infectivity during
neurogenesis. In support of this hypothesis, two recent papers
demonstrated the vulnerability of neural stem and progenitor
cells to ZIKV using in vitro cultures derived from pluripotent
stem cells (Tang et al., 2016; P.P. Garce
ˆ z, E.C. Loiola, R.M. da
Costa, L.M. Higa, P. Trindade, R. Delvecchio, J.M. Nascimento,
R. Brindeiro, A. Tanuri, and S.K. Rehen, 2016, PeerJ, preprint).
Many surface proteins facilitate flavivirus entry into cells (Per-
era-Lecoin et al., 2014), but the precise mechanism remains
largely unknown and additional factors may also contribute to
infection. Several of these proteins are sufficient to support
ZIKV entry into HEK293T cells that normally have low infectivity,
including DC-SIGN (encoded by CD209), TIM1 (encoded by
HAVCR1), TYRO3, and AXL. Furthermore, blocking or silencing

 AXL reduces infectivity in cultured fibroblasts and alveolar
epithelial cells by as much as 90% (Hamel et al., 2015). Under-
standing the expression patterns of putative flavivirus receptors
could strengthen the possible link between ZIKV infection and
microcephaly and support the discovery of a mechanism of
ZIKV neurovirulence.
To identify cell populations that may be particularly vulnerable
to ZIKV infection, we analyzed the expression of candidate
genes mediating flavivirus entry across single cells from the
developing human cerebral cortex (Figure 1A). We previously
classified single cells from developing cortex as astrocytes,
radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells, and immature excit-
atory and inhibitory neurons using patterns of genome-wide
gene expression (Pollen et al., 2015). To survey additional cell
types, we also analyzed cells from developing cortex that ex-
press markers of microglia and endothelial cells (Table S1).
Importantly, while many candidate entry receptors and attach-
ment factors have been described, other unknown factors may
mediate ZIKV entry, and we also include a global table of gene
expression across single cells (Table S2). Across cell types, we
found that multiple putative flavivirus entry receptor genes,
including AXL and heat shock protein genes, showed a strong
pattern of enrichment in radial glia cells, astrocytes, endothelial
cells, and microglia, suggesting that these cell types may be
particularly vulnerable to ZIKV infection (Figures 1A and 1B).
AXL, known to mediate ZIKV and dengue virus entry in human
skin cells (Hamel et al., 2015), showed particularly high expres-
sion in radial glia (78/96 radial glia displayed expression greater
than 6 log2 normalized read counts). In contrast, other candidate
genes known to permit ZIKV entry showed more limited expres-
sion at this threshold including TYRO3 (7/418 cells and 5/96
radial glia) and CD209 (DC-SIGN, 0/418 cells, Figure S1). Based
on these observations, we further investigated the expression
pattern of AXL protein in primary human tissue samples using
immunohistochemistry. At mid-neurogenesis, AXL is expressed
in a highly reproducible pattern throughout the cortex, with
strong expression bordering the lateral ventricle and in the outer
subventricular zone (OSVZ) (Figures 2C, 2D, and S1). Closer ex-
amination revealed that staining along the ventricle resulted from
specific localization of AXL to radial glia apical end-feet (Figures
2D and S1). AXL was also detected at the pial end-feet of radial
glia near the meninges (Figure 2B). In recent years a second
population of radial glial cells, known as outer radial glia (oRG),
has been identified in the OSVZ of the developing human brain
(Fietz et al., 2010; Hansen et al., 2010). We observed high levels
of AXL in the cell bodies of oRG cells, accounting for the pattern
of AXL labeling in the OSVZ (Figures 2C and S1). In addition,
pronounced AXL immunostaining outlined brain capillaries
(Figures 2A and S1), consistent with AXL expression observed
in endothelial cells by single-cell analysis. We further examined
AXL expression from stages of early neurogenesis (GW13.5) to
term. We found that AXL expression persisted in radial glia
throughout the period of neurogenesis and in capillaries
and astrocytes to term but remained largely absent from
SATB2-expressing neurons, even at later developmental stages
(Figure S1).
A recent report of 29 infants with presumed ZIKV micro-
cephaly reported that 10 (34.5%) had severe ocular abnormal-
ities. The ocular lesions consisted of focal pigment mottling
and chorioretinal atrophy that was particularly severe in the mac-
ula (de Paula Freitas et al., 2016). Therefore, we examined AXL
expression in developing human retina. We dissected two hu-
man neural retina samples at GW10 and GW12 and captured sin-
gle cells for mRNA sequencing. AXL was highly expressed in
cells that had a stem cell gene signature (Figures 1G and S1).
To confirm this finding, we immunostained tissue sections of
developing retina. AXL was expressed along the outer margin
of the neural retina, where it was co-expressed with SOX2, a
marker of neural stem cells. In addition, AXL was highly enriched
in cells of the ciliary marginal zone, adjacent to the neural retina
(Figure 1G).
We next investigated the possible conservation of AXL expres-
sion across model systems that could be used to study the
mechanism of ZIKV infection and pathogenicity. Public reposi-
tories of in situ hybridization data indicate AXL expression in
mouse radial glia (Figure 2A). In addition, previous studies of
mouse cortex reported enriched Axl expression in the apical
end-feet of radial glia cells (Wang et al., 2011). We examined
the expression pattern of AXL in developing ferret cortex and
found that, similar to human cortex, AXL is expressed in the
end-feet of radial glia cells at the ventricular edge and in oRG
cells in the OSVZ (Figure 2B). Finally, we generated human
iPSC-derived cerebral organoids and observed AXL expression
along the lumen of neuroepithelial-like rosette regions in the or-
ganoids, which resemble the VZ of primary human cortex, and in
SOX2-expressing cells away from the lumen (Figure S2). The
specific expression of AXL in radial glia-like and oRG-like cells
in the organoids and limited expression in neurons is consistent
with observations from single-cell mRNA-seq analysis of simi-
larly derived cerebral organoids (Figures 2C and S2). Interest-
ingly, human cerebral organoids also contain cells that resemble
early choroid plexus cells (Sakaguchi et al., 2015), and these
cells strongly express AXL (Figures 2C and S2), consistent with
the expression pattern in embryonic mouse (Figure 2A).
Here we report that the candidate ZIKV receptor AXL is highly
enriched in radial glia, the neural stem cells of the human fetal
cerebral cortex, providing a hypothesis for why these cells are
particularly vulnerable to ZIKV infection and providing a candi-
date mechanism for ZIKV-induced microcephaly. This finding
supports recent suggestions that ZIKV preferentially targets
in-vitro-derived progenitor cells rather than immature neurons
(Tang et al., 2016). Furthermore, we show that AXL is expressed

(F) Strong AXL immunostaining in the VZ can be detected at the edge of the lateral ventricle. Examples of abventricular radial glia with strong AXL expression are

from GW10 and GW12 primary human neural retina (see also Figure S1). Immunostaining for AXL protein shows strong expression in SOX2-expressing cells at the
outer edge of the neural retina (NR), and in addition, very strong staining in the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ). Patches of strong AXL staining are indicated by arrows.

 by cortical astrocytes, blood microcapillaries, microglia, and
progenitors in the neural retina and ciliary marginal zone. The
latter finding could help explain how ZIKV causes ocular lesions
(de Paula Freitas et al., 2016). The specificity of AXL expression
in radial glia neural stem cells is also conserved in mouse and
ferret cerebral cortex and in human PSC-derived cerebral orga-
noids. We suggest that these diverse systems may support
studies of ZIKV infectivity in radial glia and the downstream con-
sequences that may mediate disease pathogenesis.
Transgenic mouse models of microcephaly mutations often
show less severe phenotypes than human patients with the
same mutation (Barkovich et al., 2012; Gruber et al., 2011; Lizar-
raga et al., 2010; Woods et al., 2005). Differences in brain devel-
opment that include massively expanded OSVZ and increased
diversity of cortical progenitors in the human cortex likely
contribute to this difference. For example, the contribution of
oRG cells to brain malformations such as microcephaly or lissen-
cephaly is largely unknown, although this cell type becomes the
predominant neural stem cell population in the developing pri-
mate and human cortex toward mid-gestation when OSVZ prolif-
eration dramatically increases (Lukaszewicz et al., 2005; Hansen
et al., 2010). Our results indicate that oRG cells express AXL at

and in oRG cells (arrows).

plots of single-cell gene expression reveal high expression of AXL in choroid plexus-like and radial glia-like cells, but lower expression in neuronal populations.

 very high levels and are likely targets for ZIKV infectivity. Involve-
ment of oRG cells, which have been linked to developmental and
evolutionary cortical expansion (Hansen et al., 2010; Ostrem
et al., 2014; Pollen et al., 2015), may make a significant contribu-
tion to the severe phenotype of ZIKV microcephaly and agyria.
Signaling through AXL suppresses the innate immune response
(Rothlin et al., 2007). In dengue virus infection, AXL not only
supports virus entry, but its kinase domain also enhances virus
infectivity following entry (Meertens et al., 2012). If ZIKV binds
AXL during entry, it may similarly activate AXL signaling and sup-
press the innate immune response, enabling the virus to better
establish an infection and prevent viral clearance (Mlakar et al.,
2016). These features suggest that a small-molecule inhibitor of
AXL function may be protective against ZIKV infectivity. However,
signaling through Axl normally supports neural stem cell survival,
proliferation, and neurogenesis (Ji et al., 2014; Lemke and Bur-
styn-Cohen, 2010), and Axl also maintains the blood-brain barrier,
protecting against the neurotropism of other viruses (Miner et al.,
2015). Interference with normal AXL has been shown to stimulate
production of inflammatory cytokines, promote microglia activa-
tion, and eventually lead to the loss of neural stem cells (Ji et al.,
2013). Therefore, while blocking AXL may protect against cellular
infection or viral replication, perturbation of AXL function may also
have multiple adverse consequences.
We propose a testable hypothesis: after breaching the
placental-fetal barrier, ZIKV reaches the developing brain by he-
matogenous spread or via the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in-
vades radial glia cells as the first target population with highest
AXL expression, either through their processes that often make
contact with blood vessels, or via their apical end-feet that
make direct contact with the CSF. By preferentially destroying
radial glia cells, the founder cell population that generates all
cortical neurons, ZIKV can produce severe microcephaly. Future
studies will be needed to test this hypothesis and particularly
whether AXL expression alone determines the cellular popula-
tion with enhanced neurotropism for ZIKV in the developing
human brain or whether other binding factors, including genes
expressed at low levels, may be involved. In addition, further
studies are urgently needed to determine (1) how the virus
crosses the placenta to infect fetal brain and causes generalized
growth restriction (Brasil et al., 2016) and (2) whether the virus in-
fects adult human brain, as ZIKV has recently been detected in
the CSF of adults (Carteaux et al., 2016; Me
´ charles et al.,
2016). Finally, other flaviviruses that use similar entry receptors
have not been strongly associated with fetal brain abnormalities,
and future work must examine potential changes in recent
strains of ZIKV. The current manuscript constitutes an initial
step toward the understanding of how ZIKV might cause devel-
opmental brain malformations.
