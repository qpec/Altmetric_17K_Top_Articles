Abstract
Background—As a pregnancy continues beyond term the risks of babies dying inside the womb
or in the immediate newborn period increase. Whether a policy of labour induction at a
predetermined gestational age can reduce this increased risk is the subject of this review.
Objectives—To evaluate the benefits and harms of a policy of labour induction at term or post-
term compared with awaiting spontaneous labour or later induction of labour.
Search methods—We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials
Register (31 March 2012).
Selection criteria—Randomised controlled trials conducted in women at or beyond term. The
eligible trials were those comparing a policy of labour induction with a policy of awaiting
spontaneous onset of labour. Cluster-randomised trials and cross-over trials are not included.
Quasi-random allocation schemes such as alternation, case record numbers or open random-
number lists were not eligible.
Data collection and analysis—Two review authors independently assessed trials for
inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were

 checked for accuracy. Outcomes are analysed in two main categories: gestational age and cervix
status.
Main results—We included 22 trials reporting on 9383 women. The trials were generally at
moderate risk of bias.
Compared with a policy of expectant management, a policy of labour induction was associated
with fewer (all-cause) perinatal deaths: risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to
0.88; 17 trials, 7407 women. There was one perinatal death in the labour induction policy group
compared with 13 perinatal deaths in the expectant management group. The number needed to
treat to benefit (NNTB) with induction of labour in order to prevent one perinatal death was 410
(95% CI 322 to 1492).
For the primary outcome of perinatal death and most other outcomes, no differences between
timing of induction subgroups were seen; the majority of trials adopted a policy of induction at 41
completed weeks (287 days) or more.
Fewer babies in the labour induction group had meconium aspiration syndrome (RR 0.50, 95% CI
0.34 to 0.73; eight trials, 2371 infants) compared with a policy of expectant management. There
was no statistically significant difference between the rates of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)
admission for induction compared with expectant management (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.04; 10
trials, 6161 infants). For women in the policy of induction arms of trials, there were significantly
fewer caesarean sections compared with expectant management in 21 trials of 8749 women (RR
0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97).
Authors’ conclusions—A policy of labour induction compared with expectant management is
associated with fewer perinatal deaths and fewer caesarean sections. Some infant morbidities such
as meconium aspiration syndrome were also reduced with a policy of post-term labour induction
although no significant differences in the rate of NICU admission were seen.
However, the absolute risk of perinatal death is small. Women should be appropriately counselled
in order to make an informed choice between scheduled induction for a post-term pregnancy or
monitoring without induction (or delayed induction).

BACKGROUND
A pregnant women is ‘at term’ when her pregnancy duration reaches 37 weeks. Up to 10%
of pregnancies continue beyond 294 days (420/7 weeks) and are described as being ‘post-
term’ or ‘postdate’ (Olesen 2003; Roos 2010; Zeitlin 2007), although this can vary markedly
between countries. This variation suggests that there are different policies and practices for
managing post-term pregnancies in Europe (Zeitlin 2007) and beyond.

 While the aetiology of post-term birth is not well elucidated (Mandruzzato 2010), risk
factors such as obesity, nulliparity and maternal age greater than 30 years have been
associated with an increased risk of post-term birth (Arrowsmith 2011; Caughey 2009b;
Roos 2010). Placental senescence may play a role in the pathophysiology of post-term birth
(Mandruzzato 2010).
Both the mother and the infant are at increased risk of adverse events when the pregnancy
continues beyond term. Hilder 1998 reported the risk of fetal or infant loss per 1000 ongoing
pregnancies beyond term. After 41 weeks, neonatal and postneonatal death risk increased
significantly. Olesen et al conducted a cross-sectional study of birth registry data between
1978 to 1993 in Denmark (Olesen 2003) showing similar results, that is, significant increase
in perinatal death and morbidities. The majority of post-term births occurred at 42 weeks
(87%) while less than 1% of women gave birth at 44 weeks or later. The overall risk of
perinatal death was 0.4% in the post-term group and 0.3% in the term group in the Olesen et
al study. In a later study report from the Norwegian Birth Registry (Heimstad 2008), the
perinatal death rate was 0.018% at day 287 and 0.51% at day 302+. These findings are
important in that, even in a setting where early booking allows accurate assessment of
gestational age and antenatal services are accessible for most women, post-term pregnancy
constitutes a high-risk situation, especially for the baby.
The obstetric problems associated with post-term pregnancy include induction of labour
with an unfavourable cervix, caesarean section, prolonged labour, postpartum haemorrhage
and traumatic birth. It is likely that some of these unwanted outcomes result from
intervening when the uterus and cervix are not ready for labour.
Early pregnancy ultrasound is associated with a reduced incidence of post-term pregnancy
possibly by avoiding misclassification (Whitworth 2010). Induction of labour is widely
practised to try and prevent the problems mentioned above and improve the health outcome
for women and their infants. Unfortunately, labour induction may itself cause problems
especially when the cervix is not favourable. Furthermore, the ideal timing for induction of
labour is not clear. In the past there was a tendency to await spontaneous labour until 42
completed weeks. However, an earlier version of this review, last revised in 1999, suggested
that induction of labour at or from 41 weeks reduced perinatal mortality without increasing
caesarean section and other adverse outcomes (Crowley 2006). Other authors have
concluded that labour induction at 41 weeks or more is associated with a reduced caesarean
section rate and no difference in perinatal mortality (Sanchez-Ramos 2003). Earlier studies
have also looked at interventions before the post-term stage is reached.
The gestational age and cervix being unfavourable may affect the success of the induction of
labour and the resulting caesarean section rates. When the cervix is favourable (usually a
Bishop score of six or more), induction is often carried out by oxytocin and artificial rupture
of amniotic membranes. If the cervix is not favourable then usually a prostaglandin gel or
tablet is placed in the vagina or cervix to ripen the cervix and initiate the uterine contractions
and labour. Many protocols are used with varying repeat intervals and transition to oxytocin
and amniotomy depending on the onset of uterine contractions and progress of cervical

 dilatation. Recently, the use of oral (Alfirevic 2006) and vaginal (Hofmeyr 2010)
misoprostol for labour induction have been reviewed.
The earlier versions of this review included interventions such as early pregnancy ultrasound
that may have an effect on the outcome of pregnancies for women at or beyond term. (This
topic is addressed in the Cochrane review ‘Ultrasound for fetal assessment in early
pregnancy’ (Whitworth 2010).) In this update, we evaluate labour induction at or beyond
term compared with expectant management which may include various intensities of
monitoring.
OBJECTIVES
To assess the effects of a policy of labour induction at or beyond term compared with a
policy of awaiting spontaneous labour indefinitely (until a later gestational age or until a
maternal or fetal indication for induction of labour is identified) on pregnancy outcomes for
the infant and the mother.
METHODS
Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies—Randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion in the review.
Cluster-randomised trials and cross-over trials were not included. Quasi-random allocation
schemes such as alternation, case record numbers or open random-number lists were not
eligible.
Types of participants—Pregnant women at or beyond term were the participants in the
trials eligible for this review. Since a risk factor at this stage of pregnancy would normally
require an intervention, only trials including women at low risk for complications were
eligible. We accepted the trialists’ definition of ‘low risk’. The trials of induction of labour
in women with prelabour rupture of membranes at or beyond term were not considered in
this review (Dare 2006), although some women participating in the eligible trials may have
had ruptured membranes.
Types of interventions—The experimental intervention evaluated in this review is a
policy of labour induction at a predetermined gestational age. This policy is compared with
‘expectant management’ until an indication for birth arises. The trial protocols differ
according to:
1.
gestational age;
2.
actual method of labour induction (prostaglandins, misoprostol, +/− oxytocin),
protocol used (dosage of any drugs, timing, frequency of use and mode of
administration);
3.
expectant management protocols (intensity of fetal well-being assessment and fetal
monitoring techniques used).

 Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches—We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s
Trials Register by contacting the Trials Search Co-ordinator (31 March 2012).
The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register is maintained by the Trials
Search Co-ordinator and contains trials identified from:
1.
monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL);
2.
weekly searches of MEDLINE;
3.
weekly searches of EMBASE;
4.
handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences;
5.
weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals plus monthly BioMed
Central email alerts.
Details of the search strategies for CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE, the list of
handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the
current awareness service can be found in the ‘Specialized Register’ section within the
editorial information about the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.
Trials identified through the searching activities described above are each assigned to a
review topic (or topics). The Trials Search Co-ordinator searches the register for each
review using the topic list rather than keywords.
We did not apply any language restrictions.
Data collection and analysis
For the methods used when assessing the trials identified in the previous version of this
review, see Appendix 1.
For this update, we used the following methods when assessing the trials identified by the
updated search (Heimstad 2007a; Hernandez-Castro 2008; Imsuwan 1999; Nicholson 2008;
Nielsen 2005; Rijnders 2007; Sahraoui 2005).
Selection of studies—Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all the
potential studies we identified as a result of the search strategy. We resolved disagreements
through discussion or, when required, we consulted a third review author.
Data extraction and management—For eligible studies, two review authors extracted
the data using a data extraction form. We resolved discrepancies through discussion or by
consulting a third person. Data were entered into Review Manager software (RevMan 2011)
and checked for accuracy. When information regarding any of the above was unclear, we
attempted to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.

 Assessment of risk of bias in included studies—Two review authors independently
assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). Disagreements were resolved by
discussion or by involving a third assessor.
(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias): For each
included study we described the method used to generate the allocation sequence in
sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.
We assessed the method as:
•
low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer
random number generator);
•
high risk of bias (any non random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital
or clinic record number); or
•
unclear risk of bias.
(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias): For each included
study we described the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to
assignment and assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in
advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.
We assessed the methods as:
•
low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered
sealed opaque envelopes);
•
high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes,
alternation; date of birth); or
•
unclear risk of bias.
(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias):
For each included study we described the methods used, if any, to blind study participants
and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We judged
studies to be at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding
could not have affected the results.
We assessed the methods as:
•
low, unclear or high risk of bias for participants;
•
low, unclear or high risk of bias for personnel.
(3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias): For each
included study we described the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from
knowledge of which intervention a participant received.
We assessed the methods as:
Gülmezoglu et al.

 •
low, unclear or high risk of bias for outcome assessors.
(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount,
nature and handling of incomplete outcome data): For each included study we described
the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated
whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each
stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion
where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to
outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported by the trial authors, we re-included
missing data in the analyses which we undertook. We assessed methods as:
•
low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced
across groups);
•
high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing not balanced across groups;
‘as treated’ analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from
that assigned at randomisation); or
•
unclear risk of bias.
(5) Selective reporting bias (checking for possible reporting bias): For each included
study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias
and what we found. We assessed the methods as:
•
low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study’s prespecified outcomes and
all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);
•
high risk of bias (where not all the study’s pre-specified outcomes have been
reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes
of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include
results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or
•
unclear risk of bias.
(6) Other sources of bias (checking for bias due to problems not covered by (1) to (5)
above): For each included study we described any important concerns we have about other
possible sources of bias.
We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:
•
low risk of other bias;
•
high risk of other bias; or
•
unclear whether there is risk of other bias.
(7) Overall risk of bias: We made explicit judgements about whether studies are at high
risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Handbook (Higgins 2011). With reference
to (1) to (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether
we considered it likely to impact on the findings.

 Measures of treatment effect
Dichotomous data: For dichotomous data, we presented results as risk ratio with 95%
confidence intervals.
Continuous data: For continuous data, we used the mean difference with 95% confidence
intervals if outcomes were measured in the same way between trials.
Dealing with missing data—For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. We
intended to explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the
overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analyses but most trials reported
low levels of missing data. For all outcomes we carried out, as far as possible, analyses on
an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each
group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number
randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.
Assessment of heterogeneity—We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-
analysis using the T2, I2 and Chi2 statistics. We regarded heterogeneity to be substantial
when I2 was greater than 30% and either T2 was greater than zero, or there was a low P
value (less than 0.10) in the Chi2 test for heterogeneity.
Assessment of reporting biases—We investigated reporting biases (such as
publication bias) by visually assessing funnel plots for meta-analyses of more than 10 trials.
Data synthesis—We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software
(RevMan 2011). We used fixed-effect inverse variance meta-analysis for combining data
where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials’ populations and methods
were judged to be sufficiently similar.
Where substantial heterogeneity was identified in a fixed-effect meta-analysis, we noted this
and repeated the analysis using a random-effects method and presented the analysis as the
average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals and the estimates of T2 and I2.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity—We planned to conduct
the following a priori subgroup analyses.
1.
Gestational age by week of gestation when induction was intended in the
intervention arm.
In this update we have presented the main groups as close to this as study reporting
would allow - gestational ages 37 to 39 weeks; 39 to 40 weeks; 41 completed
weeks (287 days) and > 41 completed weeks (> 287 days).
2.
Condition of cervix (favourable versus unfavourable).
3.
By method of induction (including dosage, timing, frequency and mode of
administration).
We conducted the first two analyses but did not have sufficient data to look at the results by
method of induction.

 We examined and reported on the results of interaction tests for outcomes assessed under
either fixed-effect or random-effects models.
Sensitivity analysis—Only three trials (Hannah 1992; Heimstad 2007a; NICHHD 1994)
reported adequate methods of allocation concealment with no other bias component judged
to be of high risk. Consequently we did not carry out sensitivity analyses according to risk of
bias but will do so in future updates of this review as more data become available.
RESULTS
Description of studies
See: Characteristics of included studies; Characteristics of excluded studies; Characteristics
of ongoing studies.
For this update we have now incorporated the trial reports that were previously awaiting
classification. We have included three new trials (Heimstad 2007a; Nielsen 2005; Sahraoui
2005), excluded three new trials (Hernandez-Castro 2008; Imsuwan 1999; Nicholson 2008)
and added one ongoing trial (Rijnders 2007).
This updated review is now comprised of 22 included studies reporting on 9383 women (see
Characteristics of included studies), 64 excluded studies (see Characteristics of excluded
studies) and one ongoing study (see Characteristics of ongoing studies).
Most of the excluded trials were comparisons of different labour induction or cervical
ripening protocols. More details are provided in the Characteristics of excluded studies
table.
Gestational age at trial entry—All trials included low-risk women with ‘certain’
gestational age and gestational age was generally well reported.
Cervix status—Eleven trials did not mention or specify cervix status as an inclusion
criterion (Augensen 1987; Bergsjo 1989; Breart 1982; Chakravarti 2000; Cole 1975;
Heimstad 2007a; Henry 1969; James 2001; Roach 1997; Suikkari 1983; Witter 1987). Eight
trials included women with unfavourable cervix (Dyson 1987; Gelisen 2005; Hannah 1992;
Herabutya 1992; Martin 1989; NICHHD 1994; Ocon 1997; Sahraoui 2005) and three with
favourable cervical status (Chanrachkul 2003; Egarter 1989; Nielsen 2005).
Settings—Of the 22 included trials:
•
five were conducted in USA (Dyson 1987; Martin 1989; NICHHD 1994; Nielsen
2005; Witter 1987);
•
two in China (Bergsjo 1989; Roach 1997);
•
two in India (Chakravarti 2000; James 2001);
•
two in Thailand (Chanrachkul 2003; Herabutya 1992);
•
two in Norway (Augensen 1987; Heimstad 2007a);

 •
two in the UK (Cole 1975; Henry 1969);
•
one in Tunisia (Sahraoui 2005);
•
one in Turkey (Gelisen 2005)
•
one in Canada (Hannah 1992);
•
one in France (Breart 1982);
•
one in Austria (Egarter 1989);
•
one in Spain (Ocon 1997); and
•
one in Finland (Suikkari 1983).
Interventions—All trials were conducted in hospitals with various intensities of fetal
monitoring both in the induction and expectant management groups (see Characteristics of
included studies).
Timing of induction - induction group: Although we had intended to report gestation by
intended time of induction in the policy of labour induction arm, we were limited to the
following five categories due to incomplete reporting and policies that overlapped weeks of
gestation:
•
37 to 39 weeks: one trial (Breart 1982) induced women at 37 to 39 weeks gestation
(number of days not reported) in the policy of labour induction arm.
•
39 to 40 weeks (days not reported): three trials induced women at 39 to 40 weeks
(up to 286 days) gestation in the policy of labour induction arms (Cole 1975;
Egarter 1989; Nielsen 2005).
•
< 41 weeks (days not reported): one trial (Chakravarti 2000) reported that they
induced women in the policy of labor induction at less than 41 weeks.
•
41 completed weeks (287 days): four trials reported that they induced women in
the intervention arm at 41 completed weeks (410/7 or 287 days) - Dyson 1987;
Gelisen 2005; James 2001; Martin 1989.
•
> 41 weeks (> 287 days): in the remaining 13 trials (Augensen 1987; Bergsjo
1989; Chanrachkul 2003; Hannah 1992; Heimstad 2007a; Henry 1969; Herabutya
1992; NICHHD 1994; Ocon 1997; Roach 1997; Sahraoui 2005; Suikkari 1983;
Witter 1987), women in the policy of labour induction arms were generally induced
after 287 days gestation up to 294 days (42 completed weeks), with the NICHHD
1994 trial extending from 41 to 43 completed weeks (430/7; 301 days).
In some trials, the actual gestational age at induction in the induction groups may have been
slightly later than the gestational threshold specified at trial entry (e.g. Hannah 1992).

 Method of induction - induction group: Labour induction was by oxytocin with or without
artificial rupture of membranes in most trials. In trials recruiting women with unfavourable
cervix, priming with prostaglandins or laminaria were often undertaken before induction.
Of the 22 included trials:
•
one trial did not report the method used (Chakravarti 2000);
•
17 trials used oxytocin infusion in some or all women in their intervention group
(Augensen 1987; Bergsjo 1989; Breart 1982; Chanrachkul 2003; Cole 1975; Dyson
1987; Gelisen 2005; Hannah 1992; Heimstad 2007a; Henry 1969; Herabutya 1992;
James 2001; Martin 1989; NICHHD 1994; Nielsen 2005; Suikkari 1983; Witter
1987). Of those trials, only one used oxytocin as the sole method of induction
(Augensen 1987). Eleven trials used artificial rupture of membranes (AROM), as
well as oxytocin infusion (when possible) (Bergsjo 1989; Breart 1982; Chanrachkul
2003; Cole 1975; Heimstad 2007a; Henry 1969; Herabutya 1992; James 2001;
Nielsen 2005; Suikkari 1983; Witter 1987);
•
none of the included trials used AROM as the sole method of induction;
•
eight trials used intravaginal prostaglandin E2 for some or all women in the
intervention group (in either gel or pessary form) (Dyson 1987; Egarter 1989;
Hannah 1992; Herabutya 1992; NICHHD 1994; Ocon 1997; Roach 1997; Sahraoui
2005). Four trials used prostaglandin E2 as the sole method of induction (Egarter
1989; Ocon 1997; Roach 1997; Sahraoui 2005) and four trials used a combination
of prostaglandin and oxytocin +/− AROM (Dyson 1987; Hannah 1992; Herabutya
1992; NICHHD 1994);
•
two trials used vaginal misoprostol in some or all women in the intervention group
(Gelisen 2005; Heimstad 2007a);
•
two trials had more than one intervention group (Gelisen 2005; NICHHD 1994),
although the placebo priming and oxytocin arm in NICHHD 1994 was not included
in this review. The Gelisen 2005 trial had three labour induction arms with
misoprostol, oxytocin and Foley catheter.
Expectant management group protocols—For the majority of trials, expectant
management protocols included various combinations of fetal heart rate monitoring,
ultrasound for amniotic fluid measurements and, in earlier studies, biochemical tests. Two
trials had no intervention, followed by induction of labour (IOL) (if no spontaneous labour)
at 43 weeks (Bergsjo 1989) or 41 weeks (Cole 1975).
Of the 22 included trials, no gestational age limit for induction was imposed or reported in
seven (Dyson 1987; Henry 1969; James 2001; Ocon 1997; Roach 1997; Suikkari 1983;
Witter 1987). In the remaining 15 trials, women were induced at the following times (unless
they went into spontaneous labour earlier) in the expectant management groups:
•
IOL at 41 weeks (Cole 1975).

 •
IOL at 42 weeks (Breart 1982; Chakravarti 2000; Egarter 1989; Gelisen 2005;
Nielsen 2005; Sahraoui 2005).
•
IOL at 42 to 43 weeks (Augensen 1987).
•
IOL at 43 weeks (Bergsjo 1989; Heimstad 2007a; Martin 1989).
•
IOL at 44 weeks (Chanrachkul 2003; Hannah 1992; Herabutya 1992; NICHHD
1994).
Risk of bias in included studies
Two trials (Chakravarti 2000; Suikkari 1983) are available only as abstracts and despite
extensive searches we could not locate full publications of the studies, which limited our
assessment of their risk of bias.
We judged the majority of included trials to be at moderate risk of bias (Figure 1; Figure 2).
Allocation—Ten trials reported using some form of adequate random sequencing such as a
computer-generated sequence or a list of random numbers (low risk of bias). The remaining
12 trials did not report how a random sequence was generated.
Of the 22 included trials, only four reported a method of allocation concealment likely to
have a low risk of bias - either central randomisation or sequentially numbered sealed
opaque envelopes (Hannah 1992; Heimstad 2007a; NICHHD 1994; Nielsen 2005). Seven
trials reported that they used an envelope system with an unclear risk of bias (Breart 1982;
Dyson 1987; Gelisen 2005; James 2001; Martin 1989; Roach 1997; Witter 1987), one trial
reported a partial third party system also with unclear risk of bias (Augensen 1987) and 10
trials did not report a method for concealing allocation (Bergsjo 1989; Chakravarti 2000;
Chanrachkul 2003; Cole 1975; Egarter 1989; Henry 1969; Herabutya 1992; Ocon 1997;
Sahraoui 2005; Suikkari 1983).
Blinding
Performance bias: Given the nature of the intervention (induction of labour) versus
expectant management, it was not possible for participants or clinicians to be blinded to the
treatment group.
Detection bias: It would have been possible for outcome assessment to have been
undertaken by someone blinded to allocation groups. However, all studies but one did not
report whether or not outcome assessment was blinded. One study indicated partial blinding
of outcome assessment (Hannah 1992); an adjudication of abnormal neonatal outcomes was
undertaken by a neonatologist who was unaware of the mothers’ group assignments.
Measurement of outcomes such as perinatal death should not be biased by lack of blinding.
Incomplete outcome data—The majority of trials (19/22) were judged to be at low risk
of attrition bias, with three trials judged to be at unclear risk of attrition bias (Breart 1982;
Cole 1975; Egarter 1989). We judged the Breart 1982 and Egarter 1989 trials to be at
unclear risk of bias, due to protocol deviations and we judged the Cole 1975 study to be at

 increased risk due to post-randomisation exclusion of mistakenly included participants. In
the Hannah 1992 trial, seven women whose babies had lethal congenital anomalies were
excluded after randomisation, and this may have influenced the comparisons for perinatal
death rates, as other trials did not exclude such anomalies or did not state that they did. In
the Witter 1987 trial, some women gave birth prior to 42 weeks (35/103 in the intervention
group and 39/97 in the expectant group) and were included in analyses, in contrast to other
trials where births prior to the interventions were excluded.
Selective reporting—We judged the risk of selective reporting bias to be high for four
trials and unclear for a further six trials. The trials rated as high risk of bias failed to report
on the primary outcome of perinatal death and usually omitted other expected outcomes as
well (Breart 1982; Nielsen 2005; Roach 1997; Witter 1987). For the trials rated as unclear
risk of bias, two were only available as abstracts (Chakravarti 2000; Suikkari 1983) with
abbreviated reporting of outcomes and the Bergsjo 1989; Egarter 1989; and Henry 1969
trials also did not appear to fully report their outcomes. The Ocon 1997 trial appears not to
have reported perinatal deaths (although this paper had to be translated to English so there is
some uncertainty about this).
Other potential sources of bias—Most of the trials appeared to be free of other
potential sources of bias. We judged three trials to be at unclear risk of bias - Chakravarti
2000 and Suikkari 1983 because of the limited reporting in these abstracts; and in Egarter
1989 there was some imbalance in the numbers of women randomised to each group.
Effects of interventions
We have presented the results by intended timing in the policy of labour induction arms of
each trial (37-39 weeks; 39-40 weeks, < 41 weeks, 41 weeks, > 41 weeks).
Primary outcome
Perinatal death: Significantly fewer perinatal deaths occurred in the labour induction
groups than the expectant management groups: risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.81; one perinatal death occurred in the induction group compared
with 13 in the expectant group (17 trials with 7407 women) - Analysis 1.1. Interaction tests
failed to demonstrate significant differences between the timing of induction subgroups
(39-40 weeks; 41 weeks; and > 41 weeks) - Analysis 1.1.
Omitting the trials where women were induced at less than 41 completed weeks (< 287
days) made little difference to the result (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.88).
Some trials (e.g. Hannah 1992) excluded perinatal deaths due to congenital abnormalities
while other trials included these. If the three deaths reported to be due to congenital
anomalies are excluded, there were no deaths in the labour induction group and 11 in the
expectant management group, across all the gestational age groups. Again, this made little
difference to the overall result (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.83).

 Table 1 details the respective causes of death for the 14 babies. The number needed to treat
to benefit (NNTB) with a policy of induction of labour in order to prevent one perinatal
death was 410 (95% CI 322 to 1492).
Five trials (Breart 1982; Chakravarti 2000; Ocon 1997; Roach 1997; Witter 1987) did not
report perinatal mortality.
Secondary outcomes
Stillbirths: Seven of the 14 perinatal deaths were stillbirths. All seven stillbirths occurred in
the expectant management groups (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.08; 17 trials with 7407
women) - Analysis 1.2. Interaction tests failed to demonstrate significant differences
between the timing of induction subgroups (39-40 weeks; 41 weeks; and > 41 weeks) -
Analysis 1.2.
Neonatal deaths: There were also seven live birth deaths (all occurring before seven days
of life). One of these was in the induction group and six were in the expectant group (RR
0.37, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.38; 17 trials with 7407 women - Analysis 1.3). None of the
interaction tests showed significant differences between subgroups (39-40 weeks, 41 weeks,
> 41 weeks) - Analysis 1.3.
Birth asphyxia: In two trials, birth asphyxia was not significantly different between the
induction (both trials > 41 weeks) and expectant groups (Chanrachkul 2003; Heimstad
2007a; a total of 757 women): RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.51 to 6.76 (Analysis 1.4).
Meconium aspiration syndrome: The risk of meconium aspiration syndrome was
significantly reduced in the induction groups compared with the expectant management
groups (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.73; eight trials of 2371 women) - Analysis 1.5.
Interaction tests failed to show significant differences between the 41 weeks and > 41 weeks
subgroups - Analysis 1.5.
Newborn intensive care unit (NICU) admission: There was no statistically significant
difference in NICU admissions when labour induction was compared with expectant
management (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.04; 10 trials of 6161 women) - Analysis 1.6. No
significant differences were seen in subgroup interaction tests (39-40 weeks; 41 weeks; > 41
weeks) - Analysis 1.6.
Apgar score less than seven at five minutes: There was no significant difference between
the rates of Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.18 (10
trials; 5379 women - Analysis 1.7). No significant differences were seen in subgroup
interaction tests (39-40 weeks; 41 weeks; > 41 weeks) - Analysis 1.7.
Birthweight greater than 4000 g: There was a statistically significant reduction in the rate
of macrosomia (greater than 4000 g) in the labour induction groups (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64
to 0.84; six trials (41 weeks; > 41 weeks induction) of 5217 women; fixed-effect). With an
I2 of 75%; T2 = 0.12 and Chi2 P value = 0.001, this analysis demonstrated very substantial
statistical heterogeneity. Under a random-effects analysis, there was no longer a significant

 difference (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.05 - Analysis 1.8). The heterogeneity is likely to be
due to the highly positive results from Gelisen 2005 (a subgroup interaction test was highly
significant; P < 0.0001), though differences in timing of induction (41 weeks versus > 41
weeks) do not seem a likely explanation here. A sensitivity analysis excluding Gelisen 2005
reduced the I2 to 0% and the summary estimate was still statistically significantly in favour
of induction, though attenuated (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.99; fixed-effect).
Birthweight (g): A statistically significant but small decrease in birthweight was seen in the
induction group compared with the expectant management groups (mean difference (MD)
−57.79 g, 95% CI −99.84 to −15.73; nine trials; 2579 women) - Analysis 1.9; I2 36%;
random-effects). No significant differences were seen in subgroup interaction tests (39 - 40
weeks; 41 weeks; > 41 weeks) - Analysis 1.9.
Caesarean section: There were significantly fewer caesarean sections in the induction
groups compared with the expectant management groups in 21 trials of 8749 women (RR
0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97 - Analysis 1.10). No significant differences were seen in subgroup
interaction tests (37-39 weeks; 39-40 weeks; < 41 weeks; 41 weeks; > 41 weeks) - Analysis
1.10.
Operative vaginal birth (forceps or ventouse): In the 12 trials of 6227 women that
reported this outcome, the rate of operative vaginal birth was higher (of borderline
significance) in the policy of labour induction groups compared with expectant management
(RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.21) - Analysis 1.11. There was significant interaction between
subgroups (P = 0.04) driven by a single trial (Breart 1982) which induced women at 37-39
weeks in the induction arm - Analysis 1.11.
Postpartum haemorrhage: Only two trials (757 women) reported rates of postpartum
haemorrhage; both were induced women at > 41 weeks in the induction arms. There was no
significant difference between labour induction and control groups for this outcome (RR
0.91, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.44) - Analysis 1.12.
Unreported outcomes: No trials reported maternal mental health outcomes, maternal
satisfaction, breastfeeding or longer term outcomes such as infant or child
neurodevelopment.
State of cervix subgroup analysis: With no statistically significant subgroup interaction
tests, there were no clear differences between the favourable and unfavourable cervix
subgroups for any outcomes (Analysis 2.1 to Analysis 2.12).
Funnel plots: Visual asymmetry was seen in funnel plots for perinatal death (Figure 3);
meconium aspiration syndrome (Figure 4) and caesarean section (Figure 5). The asymmetry
in the funnel plots for perinatal death and meconium aspiration is compatible with missing
small negative trials but it is not clear if that is the reason for the asymmetry. For caesarean
section, the funnel plot has a ‘flattened’ appearance, which does not lend itself to clear
interpretation.

 DISCUSSION
Since women with post-term pregnancies may go into spontaneous labour or may need to be
induced at some point in the future, it is important to recognise that management choices are
between inducing or not inducing at a particular time, as opposed to having or not having a
spontaneous labour (Caughey 2009a; Keirse 2010). Thus this review evaluates trials where a
policy of induction has been compared with a policy of waiting. In other words, women
scheduled to be induced may not be; and women choosing to wait may end up being
induced. For example, about one-third of the women randomised to the induction policy
group in the Hannah trial were not induced; and about one-third of the women randomised
to waiting or expectant management were induced (Hannah 1992; Keirse 2010).
We have presented the results by intended timing in the policy of labour induction arms of
each trial (37- 39 weeks; 39 - 40 weeks; < 41 weeks; 41 weeks; and > 41 weeks) although a
policy of induction at less than 41 weeks will no longer be clinically relevant in most
settings.
In this 2011 update, we have added three new trials (Heimstad 2007a; Nielsen 2005;
Sahraoui 2005). Compared with a policy of expectant management, a policy of labour
induction was associated with fewer perinatal deaths (with one perinatal death in the labour
induction policy group compared with 13 perinatal deaths in the expectant management
group). The corresponding figures for a policy of induction at 41 weeks or more were one
and 11 deaths. Although some trials excluded deaths from congenital anomalies, other trials
did not exclude these deaths. If the three deaths reported to be due to congenital anomalies
are excluded, the overall findings remain very similar.
Fewer babies in the labour induction at 41 to 42 weeks group had meconium aspiration
syndrome compared with a policy of expectant management; and no significant difference
between the rates of neonatal intensive care unit admission were seen.
There is concern about the high and increasing induction rate in many countries, and
increasing caesarean rates despite an increase in induction rates (Keirse 2010). Reassuringly,
in this review we found that there were significantly fewer caesarean sections in the
induction groups compared with the expectant management groups.
In a recent report from Australia, the overall induction rate increased from 25% in 1998 to
29% in 2007 in New South Wales; the 2007 rate for induction of labour at 41 weeks was
51% (a 10% increase from 1998) and 56% at 42 weeks (a 1% increase from 1998) (Mealing
2009). This is similar to the overall induction rate seen in the Hannah 1992 trial.
However, the favourable results for caesarean births in the large Hannah 1992 trial have
been questioned by some authors. They have pointed out that the women who were induced
in the policy of induction group (66% of this group) may have had a more effective cervical
ripening regimen than the women who were induced in the expectant management group
(33% of this group) and that more women in the expectant management group had a
caesarean section for fetal distress (8.3% versus 5.7% in the induction group) (Keirse 2010;
Mandruzzato 2010).

 In a recent retrospective cohort study, prolonged pregnancy was significantly more common
in obese women than in normal weight women (30% versus 22%); leading to an increased
rate of induction of labour ending in caesarean section for these obese women (28% versus
19% for normal weight women) (Arrowsmith 2011). Despite these higher caesarean rates,
an obese woman with prolonged pregnancy would have a 60% chance of vaginal birth if
primiparous and a 90% chance if multiparous based on these analyses (Arrowsmith 2011).
Compared with expectant management, induction of labour at 41 weeks in nulliparous
women has been shown to be cost-effective; ranging from US$2932 to $21,612 per quality-
adjusted life years (QALY) gained (Kaimal 2011). Using probabilistic sensitivity analyses,
induction of labour in nulliparous women at 41 weeks would be a cost-effective intervention
96% of the time, if society was willing to bear the cost of $50,000 per QALY (Kaimal
2011).
Current obstetric guidelines from Canada (SOGC 2008) and the UK (NICE 2008)
recommend offering induction of labour to women after 41 completed weeks, with fetal
assessment and monitoring if expectant management is chosen, a policy which has been
construed by some as a recommendation to routinely induce women at 41 weeks
(Menticoglou 2002). Analyses of data from Norway indicate that a policy of routine
induction at 41 weeks (287 days) would result in 240 inductions per 1000 compared with 90
per 1000 at induction at 42 weeks (293 days) or four per 1000 at 43 weeks (301 days)
(Heimstad 2008) and the view has been expressed that the number of inductions needed to
prevent one stillbirth is “very high” (Mandruzzato 2010) and indeed the number needed to
‘intend inducing’ of 416 to avoid one perinatal death is indeed large. However, a woman
experiencing a prolonged pregnancy is the appropriate person to judge this threshold. There
is evidence from a postpartum survey of women who participated in the Heimstad 2007a
trial that most women would choose induction at 41 to 42 weeks in a subsequent pregnancy
(Heimstad 2007b).
Potential biases in the review process
Included trials were generally at moderate risk of bias. Different trial protocols and methods
often made comparisons difficult. Some examples of these differences are inclusion or
exclusion of deaths attributed to congenital anomalies, different handling of post-
randomisation exclusions and of course variations between - and sometimes within - trials in
the methods used for cervical ripening and induction.
There is some indication of visual asymmetry in the funnel plots for perinatal death,
meconium aspiration syndrome and caesarean section although publication bias may not be,
and is probably unlikely to be, the reason for these asymmetric plots.
Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews
The most comparable systematic review is one done by Wennerholm and colleagues
(Wennerholm 2009). We have included four more trials (all in the 41 weeks or more
induction policy category) than Wennerholm 2009 in this update of our review. Inclusion of
these trials (Henry 1969; Ocon 1997; Sahraoui 2005; Suikkari 1983) in our review indicates
that a policy of induction of labour can prevent perinatal deaths whereas Wennerholm 2009
Gülmezoglu et al.

 concludes that there were no significant differences between a policy of induction and
expectant management for the outcome of perinatal death.
AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS
Implications for practice
The message from this review is that a policy of post-term induction is associated with fewer
perinatal deaths (although the absolute risk is small) without an increased risk of caesarean
section. Women should be offered the option of labour induction, probably at 41 to 42
completed weeks, with information about the absolute and relative risks of perinatal death at
different gestational age time points and for different groups such as nulliparous or obese
women, recognising that their assessments, values and preferences may differ. If a woman
chooses to wait for spontaneous labour onset, it would be prudent to have regular fetal
monitoring as longitudinal epidemiological studies suggest increased risk of perinatal death
by increasing gestational age.
Implications for research
The optimal timing of offering induction of labour to women at or beyond term warrants
further investigation, as does further exploration of risk profiles of women and their values
and preferences.

Cervix ripeness: unfavourable at trial entry (first ripening and then IOL in the intervention group)
Interventions
Induction group (n = 1701): up to 3 x 0.5 mg doses of prostaglandin E2 gel administered
intracervically (if NST was normal and cervix unfavourable at time of induction = 77% of women),
followed by either AROM or IV oxytocin infusion, or both
Expectant management group (n = 1706): daily fetal movement counting, NST and amniotic fluid
measurement 2-3 times per week. If either the NST or amniotic fluid volume assessment was
abnormal, or other complications developed, labour was induced (28% of women induced in the
expectant group received some form of prostaglandin E2 (not gel)).
Outcomes
Mother: (1) Delivery by caesarean section.
Baby: (1) Perinatal mortality (stillbirth or neonatal death before discharge excluding deaths caused
by lethal congenital abnormalities)
(2) Neonatal morbidity (Apgar score < 7 at 5 min, asphyxial encephalopathy [seizures, alterations in
levels of consciousness or tone, or a need for tube feeding during the first 48 hours of life], or
respiratory distress [oxygen requirement > 40% and respiratory rate > 60 breaths/minute, both within

NICHHD 1994
Methods
RCT.
Participants
Number of women randomised: 440.
Setting: University hospitals in the USA.
Inclusion criteria
•
Gestational age at trial entry: at least 287 days.
•
Gestational age at intervention: 41 to 43 completed weeks (at least 287 days to < 301
days).
Exclusion criteria
• Any medical or obstetric complications requiring IOL, caesarean section or frequent monitoring
of maternal or fetal condition.
Cervix ripeness: unfavourable (Bishop score 6 or less)..
Interventions
Induction group (n = 174): 1) cervical priming with PGE2 gel followed 12 hours later with
oxytocin
versus
expectant management group (n = 175): weekly cervix assessments, twice weekly NST and
amniotic fluid volume assessment (n = 175)
A total of 265 women were randomised to the intervention arm; however, 91 of these women were
randomised to placebo gel with oxytocin 12 hours later and these women have not been included in
this review
Outcomes
Mother: (1) Time to delivery from randomisation (2) Maternal infection (3) Need for transfusion
(4) Uterine hyperactivity (5) Mode of birth (6) Maternal death.
Baby: (1) Mechanical ventilation (2) Nerve injury (3) Seizures (4) Babies with 1 adverse outcome
(5) Perinatal death (6) Apgar score < 4 at 5 mins (counted as NICU admission) (7) Late
decelerations in labour (8) Meconium in amniotic fluid (9) Meconium in aspiration pneumonia
Notes
The initial sample size intended was 2800. However, after 18 months and 440 participants, the
study was stopped, since the incidence of adverse outcome was only 1.1% and therefore a sample
size of 5600 would be required to adequately test the hypothesis proposed

The following methods were used to assess Augensen 1987; Bergsjo 1989; Breart 1982;
Chakravarti 2000; Chanrachkul 2003; Cole 1975; Dyson 1987; Egarter 1989; Gelisen 2005;

Methodological quality assessment
We evaluated trials under consideration for methodological quality and appropriateness for
inclusion, without consideration of their results. Any differences of opinion were resolved
by discussion. There was no blinding of authorship (Higgins 2005). Methodological quality
assessment included:
1.
allocation concealment: A = adequate, B = unclear, C = inadequate (will be
excluded);
2.
performance bias: blinding of carers and women is difficult to achieve in these
trials as the interventions relate to a particular timing of birth;
3.
detection bias: blind outcome assessments (A = done, B = unclear/not reported, C =
not done);
4.
attrition bias: losses to follow up were systematically recorded. If there were
unexplained imbalances or if the outcome was available in less than 80% of the
participants, the study was not used for that outcome. If this occurred for all
outcomes, the study was excluded.

 Data extraction
We extracted data for all relevant outcomes to predesigned forms for ease of extraction. AM
Gulmezoglu and P Middleton extracted the data for all trials whether they were included in
the previously published version or not. We resolved discrepancies by discussion.
Analysis strategy
The statistical analyses were conducted using the Review Manager software (RevMan
2003). We analysed categorical data using relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. We
assessed statistical heterogeneity between trials using both the Chi2 test and the I2 statistic.
Where there was no significant heterogeneity (P > 0.1, I2 < 25%), we pooled data using a
fixed-effect model. If we encountered moderate heterogeneity (I2 between 25% and 50%),
we used the random-effects model and for significant heterogeneity (I2 > 50 %) we did not
analyse the totals. We tried to identify the sources of heterogeneity by looking at trial
characteristics.
The earlier version of this review (Crowley 2006) used the Peto odds ratio (Peto OR)
statistic. We used relative risk (RR) as this is widely recommended within The Cochrane
Collaboration and by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. The Peto OR is an
appropriate statistic for meta-analysis when there are cells with ‘zero’ counts such as the
case with the perinatal death data in this review (PCG 2005). We reported the main analysis
with both RR and Peto OR and discussed the interpretation in the discussion section.
Intention-to-treat analysis
The analysis was based on ‘available cases’ as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2005a). There were no imputations for missing
outcome data. There were protocol violations such as postrandomisation exclusions and
women not receiving the allocated treatment. These occurred in both directions. Some
women allocated to induction of labour had spontaneous labour and some due for expectant
management had induction of labour for various reasons. We included these data in the
allocated groups (either using information published or seeking clarification from authors)
as much as possible (see below in methodological quality).
Sensitivity analysis
We planned to conduct sensitivity analysis according to the allocation concealment score,
should the available data allow it. We did not conduct formal sensitivity analysis because of
the limited number of studies for each comparison and outcome but discussed the impact of
quality in the discussion narratively.
Subgroup analysis
We planned to conduct a priori subgroup analyses by:

 1.
gestational age by week of gestation. The main groups here are gestational ages 37
to 40 + 6 and 41 + 0 and beyond. However, we will look at each week of gestation
if data permit in future updates;
2.
condition of cervix (favourable: Bishop score six or more; unfavourable less than
six);
3.
by method of induction (including dosage, timing, frequency and mode of
administration).
We conducted the first two analyses. We did not have sufficient data to look at the results
per week of gestation and by method of induction (most were similar, see Characteristics of
included studies).
FEEDBACK
Marowitz, 14 April 2011
Summary
Both my students and myself are unable to understand the following sentence in text for
‘Effects of the intervention’: “Women induced at 37 to 40 completed weeks were more
likely to have a caesarean section with expectant management than those in the labour
induction group (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.99).”
Are there errors in the wording of this sentence? [Comment submitted by Amy Marowitz,
April 2011]
Reply
Thank you for your feedback. We have corrected the error.

30 June 2006
New search has
been performed
The previous version of this review included studies up to 1997 and included
21 labour induction trials (Crowley 2006). This version has been re-written,
including a new protocol which now limits the scope to labour induction,
and includes 19 trials. Thirteen ofthe 21 trials included in the previous
version are included in this version. The remaining eight trials were
excluded because of alternate allocation (Cardozo 1986; Heden 1991; Katz
1983), a high proportion of postrandomiza-tion exclusion (greater than 30%
in Martin 1978 and greater than 24% in Tylleskar 1979), cervical ripening
with breast stimulation (Elliott 1984; Kadar 1990), and analysis by
intervention received (i.e. groups switched, Sande 1983). Six trials published
since the publication of the previous version have been included in this
update (Chakravarti 2000; Chanrachkul 2003; Gelisen 2005; James 2001;
Ocon 1997; Roach 1997).

 PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY
Induction of labour in women with normal pregnancies at or beyond term
A normal pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks from the start of the woman’s last menstrual
period, but anything from 37 to 42 weeks is considered as being within the normal range.
Births before 37 weeks are considered preterm because these babies often have breathing
difficulties and other problems as some of their organs are not yet fully matured. Births
after 42 weeks seem to carry a slightly increased risk for the baby and are associated with
a greater number of deaths. No tests can tell if a baby would be better to be left in the
womb or labour induced and the baby be born, so arbitrary time limits have been
suggested. This review set out to determine if induction of labour at a prespecified time
could reduce the risks for the baby. The review found 22 trials involving over 9000
women given induction of labour at various times from 37 weeks to over 42 weeks’
gestation; some were quite old trials and the quality was variable. The review grouped
the trials by a policy of induction at (1) 37 to 39 weeks, (2) 39 to 40 weeks, (3) < 41
weeks, (4) 41 weeks, and (5) > 41 weeks, compared with a policy of waiting to a later
date. There were fewer baby deaths when a labour induction policy was implemented.
Such deaths were rare with either policy. Signficantly fewer babies developed meconium
aspiration syndrome and fewer caesarean sections were required in the induction group
compared with the expectant management group. Women’s experiences and opinions
about these choices have not been adequately evaluated.
