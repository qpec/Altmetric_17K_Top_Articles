AbstrACt
Objectives Roll-your-own (RYO) cigarettes have become 
popular in the UK and reduce the cost of smoking, 
potentially mitigating the impact of tax increases on 
quitting. We examined whether RYO cigarette use was 
associated with reduced motivation to quit smoking, 
incidence of quit attempts and quit success.
Design Cross-sectional survey.
setting England.
Participants 38 590 adults who reported currently 
smoking or having stopped within the past 12 months.
Main outcome measures Motivation to quit smoking, 
quit attempt in the last year, motives for quitting and quit 
success were regressed onto RYO cigarette use, adjusting 
for sociodemographic variables and level of cigarette 
addiction. Mediation by weekly spending on smoking was 
tested.
results Compared with manufactured cigarette smokers, 
RYO smokers had lower odds of high motivation to quit 
(OR=0.77, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.81) or having made a quit 
attempt (OR=0.87, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.91). Among those who 
had attempted to quit smoking, quit success did not differ 
by cigarette type (OR=1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.12), but RYO 
smokers were less likely to report cost of smoking as a 
motive to quit (OR=0.68, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.74). Spending 
on smoking mediated the association between RYO use 
and quit attempts (β=−0.02, SE=0.003, 95% CI −0.03 to 
−0.02).
Conclusions In England, compared with smokers of 
manufactured cigarettes, RYO cigarette smokers appear 
to have lower motivation to quit and lower incidence of 
quit attempts but similar success of quit attempts. The 
lower cost of RYO smoking appears to mediate the lower 
incidence of quit attempts among RYO users.
IntrODuCtIOn 
Smoking is one of the leading risk factors 
for premature death, disease and disability, 
killing an estimated 6 million people globally 
each year.1 Raising taxes to increase the price 
of cigarettes is consistently reported as one 
of the most effective ways to prevent smoking 
uptake, reduce consumption, encourage quit 
attempts and increase rates of smoking cessa-
tion.2–5 In Europe, a 10% price increase is 
estimated to result in a 5%–7% reduction in 
cigarette consumption,6 with the young and 
those who are socioeconomically disadvan-
taged most responsive to changes in price.5 7 
In the UK, progressive tax increases on 
tobacco have seen retail cigarette prices rise 
to among the highest in Europe.8 However, 
the potential public health benefits of tobacco 
tax increases are undermined by the avail-
ability of lower cost alternatives such as roll-
your-own (RYO; also known as hand-rolled) 
tobacco. RYO cigarettes are often substan-
tially less expensive than manufactured ciga-
rettes, and a higher proportion is obtained 
illicitly.9 The tobacco industry perpetuates 
this price gap by differentially shifting tax 
increases between brand segments such 
that taxes on the cheapest products are not 
always fully passed onto consumers while 
taxes on more expensive brands are consis-
tently ‘overshifted’ with price rises over and 
above the tax increase.10 Consequently, while 
some smokers (particularly those with low 
disposable incomes) will cut down or quit 
smoking in response to price increases,2–5 
others may compensate by switching from 
manufactured to RYO cigarettes to reduce 
the cost of smoking. Indeed, studies in the 
UK and other high-income countries have 
shown that while overall smoking prevalence 
and manufactured cigarette consumption 
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► A large, representative sample of the English 
population.
 
► Aggregated data from monthly surveys spanning 
9.5 years, eliminating potential bias from seasonal 
differences in the rate of quit attempts.
 
► The assessment of the most recent quit attempt re-
lied on recall of the last 12 months.
 
► Quit success was measured by self-reported ab-
stinence, which in randomised trials would be a 
significant limitation because smokers who receive 
active treatment may feel social pressure to claim 
abstinence but is not considered too problematic in 
population surveys.

are declining, RYO use is increasing, particularly among 
younger smokers.11–14
Despite their rising popularity,11 the evidence base on 
RYO cigarettes is relatively scant. A number of studies have 
described the characteristics of RYO users as younger, 
male and more socioeconomically disadvantaged,11 14–16 
but we know little about their attitudes towards cessation 
and quitting behaviour. With RYO cigarettes providing 
a more affordable option, users may be less inclined to 
quit. Besides price, RYO cigarettes offer smokers greater 
control over a variety of aspects, including the weight 
and diameter of each cigarette, use of a filter and the 
packing density and amount of tobacco. Indeed, smokers 
have reported conserving tobacco and rolling thinner 
cigarettes to reduce the impact of increased excises taxes 
while presumably also altering smoking behaviour to 
titrate nicotine intake.17 18 Evidence suggests that many 
RYO users perceive RYO cigarettes to be less harmful 
than manufactured cigarettes19 when this is not the 
case,20 which may reduce their motivation to quit for 
health reasons.
A few studies have shown that the availability and use 
of cheap tobacco (including RYO) is associated with 
lower rates of smoking cessation.21–23 Data from the Inter-
national Tobacco Control (ITC) Four-Country Survey 
indicated that RYO users in the UK and Australia were 
less likely to report an intention to quit smoking than 
manufactured cigarette smokers, but there was no asso-
ciation between RYO cigarette use and intention to quit 
in Canada or the USA.14 RYO cigarette smokers in the 
ITC Four-Country Survey were also less likely to make a 
quit attempt than smokers who did not use RYO or other 
discounted tobacco, although this difference was not 
significant after adjustment for sociodemographics and 
heaviness of smoking.21 No differences in quit success 
between manufactured and RYO cigarette smokers were 
observed in the ITC Four-Country Survey21 or in another 
study of ~2000 smokers in New Zealand.24
The present study used data from a large popula-
tion-based sample of English adults to explore whether 
use of RYO cigarettes is associated with reduced motiva-
tion to quit, incidence of quit attempts and quit success, 
and if so, whether these associations are mediated by 
spending on smoking.
Specifically, this paper addressed the following 
questions:
1. How does the prevalence of a quit attempt in the past 
year in those who smoke RYO cigarettes compare with 
those smoking manufactured cigarettes, adjusting for a 
range of sociodemographic factors?
2. Among current smokers, how does the prevalence of 
high motivation to quit smoking in those who smoke 
RYO cigarettes compare with those smoking manufac-
tured cigarettes, adjusting for a range of sociodemo-
graphic factors?
3. Among past-year smokers who have made at least one 
quit attempt, how do success rates and quitting motives 
relating to cost and health in those who smoke RYO 
cigarettes compare with those smoking manufactured 
cigarettes, adjusting for a range of sociodemographic 
factors and cigarette dependence?
4. Are any differences in these quitting-related outcomes 
mediated by spending on smoking?
MethOD
Design
Data were from the Smoking Toolkit Study, an ongoing 
research programme designed to provide information 
about smoking prevalence and behaviour and factors that 
promote or inhibit smoking cessation at a population 
level.25 The study selects a new sample of ~1700 adults 
aged ≥16 years (of whom ~450 are smokers) each month 
using a form of random location sampling. Participants 
complete a face-to-face computer-assisted survey with a 
trained interviewer. Full details of the study’s methods are 
available elsewhere, and comparisons with national data 
indicate that key variables such as sociodemographics and 
smoking prevalence are nationally representative.25 
Patient and public involvement
Patients were not involved.
study population
For the present study, we used aggregated data from 
respondents to the survey in the period from November 
2008 (the first wave to assess motivation to quit smoking) 
to March 2018 (the latest wave for which data were avail-
able), who smoked cigarettes daily or occasionally at the 
time of the survey or during the preceding 12 months.
Measures
Measurement of exposure: RYO cigarette use
Participants reported the number of cigarettes they 
smoked (currently or before quitting, as relevant) on an 
average day, and how many of these were hand-rolled. For 
the purpose of the present analyses, we defined RYO ciga-
rette use as at least 50% of total cigarette consumption, a 
definition used by other studies examining RYO cigarette 
usage.14 This definition was favoured over a minimum 
number per day (eg, at least one RYO cigarette per day) 
as it allowed inclusion of non-daily smokers, and the 
50% threshold allowed for inclusion of individuals who 
smoked both RYO and manufactured cigarettes.
Measurement of outcomes: motivation to quit, quit attempts, quit 
motives and quit success
Motivation to quit smoking was assessed using the Moti-
vation To Stop Scale,26 a single-item measure with seven 
response options representing increasing motivation to 
quit. We defined high motivation to quit as a response of 
6 or 7, reflecting strong intentions to quit within the next 
3 months.
Attempting to quit smoking was defined as having made 
at least one serious quit attempt in the last 12 months. 
Quit success was defined as self-reported abstinence at

the time of the survey. Further information on the assess-
ment of these outcomes has been published previously.27
Those who reported quit attempts were also asked 
about a wide range of factors that contributed to their 
most recent quit attempt. We selected for analysis four 
factors that might plausibly differ according to the type 
of cigarettes smoked: ‘a decision that smoking was too expen-
sive’; ‘seeing a health warning on a cigarette packet’; ‘health 
problems I had at the time’; and ‘a concern about future health 
problems’. Because these items have only been included in 
the survey since May 2009, data were only available for a 
subsample of participants (n=12 573).
Measurement of potential confounders
All potential confounders were selected a priori. Current 
smokers reported their average weekly spending on ciga-
rettes or tobacco in pounds sterling. Demographic charac-
teristics assessed were age, sex, social grade (ABC1, which 
includes managerial, professional and intermediate occu-
pations, vs C2DE, which includes small employers and 
own-account workers, lower supervisory and technical 
occupations, and semiroutine and routine occupations, 
never workers and long-term unemployed) and region 
(government office region grouped into three categories: 
northern, central and southern England). We included 
survey year to take account of changes in tobacco control 
measures that may have impacted RYO and manufactured 
cigarette smokers differently. We also included nicotine 
dependence as a potential confounder for some analyses, 
operationalised as the strength of urges to smoke in the 
past 24 hours (from 0 ‘not at all’ to 5 ‘extremely strong’). 
This variable has previously been shown to be a better 
measure of dependence (more closely associated with 
relapse following a quit attempt) than other measures in 
this population.28
statistical analyses
Simple associations between potential confounders and 
use of RYO cigarettes were examined using analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and Pear-
son’s χ2 for categorical variables.
For our primary analyses, we used logistic regression 
to examine associations between RYO cigarette use and 
(1) motivation to quit among current smokers, (2) quit 
attempts among past-year smokers and (3) quit success 
among past-year smokers who had attempted to quit. All 
models were adjusted for age, sex, social grade, region 
and survey year. We also adjusted for nicotine dependence 
(strength of urges to smoke) in the model predicting quit 
success, as previous research in this sample has shown 
that it reliably predicts this outcome but is not associated 
with motivation or quit attempts.29 Results are presented 
as adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs). The manufactured cigarette smoker group was 
the reference category.
In a subsample of smokers who had participated in 
the survey since May 2009 and had made a serious quit 
attempt in the last 12 months, we used logistic regres-
sion to explore differences between smokers of RYO 
and manufactured cigarettes in self-reported motives for 
their most recent quit attempt, adjusting for potential 
confounders. Results are presented as adjusted ORs with 
95% CIs. The manufactured cigarette smoker group was 
the reference category.
Where RYO cigarette use was significantly associated 
with an outcome, we tested for mediation by weekly 
spending on smoking (figure 1). Establishing mediation 
requires the mediator to be correlated with the exposure 
(path a) and the outcome (path b), so we first tested asso-
ciations between weekly spending on smoking and RYO 
use and motivation to quit, quit attempts and quit success 
using ANOVA. Where these associations were significant, 
we used the sgmediation command in STATA, which calcu-
lates total (path c), direct (path c′) and indirect (path 
a×b) effects and tests the significance of the indirect effect 
using the Sobel test. We used bootstrapping with 5000 
sampling replications to estimate the 95% CI and calcu-
lated effect ratios reflecting the proportion of the total

effect of the independent variable on the dependent vari-
able that is explained by the mediator. Mediation models 
were adjusted for sociodemographics and survey year as 
previously described and additionally for daily cigarette 
consumption as we expected this to be strongly related to 
spending on smoking.
In a sensitivity analysis, we excluded participants who 
reported smoking both manufactured and RYO ciga-
rettes. In the primary analyses, these individuals were 
included in the group of RYO cigarette smokers if at least 
50% of their cigarettes were hand-rolled, or in the group 
of manufactured cigarette smokers if less than 50% of 
cigarettes smoked were hand-rolled.
All analyses were performed using SPSS V.25, with 
the exception of the mediation models that were run in 
STATA V.13.
results
Figure 2 summarises the selection of the analytic samples. 
There were 43 081 past-year cigarette smokers surveyed 
between November 2008 and March 2018. A total of 
38 590 (89.6%) provided complete data on cigarette 
consumption, recent quit attempts and on confounding 
variables and were included in the present analyses. Of 
these past-year smokers, 56.3% reported smoking only 
manufactured cigarettes, 36.6% only RYO cigarettes 
and 7.1% both manufactured and RYO cigarettes. In 
the latter group, the percentage of cigarettes that were 
RYO varied significantly (range 1%–97%) with a mean 
of 46.2% (SD=22.5). Applying the criterion of at least 
50% of cigarettes smoked being RYO resulted in a sample 
of 15 641 (40.5%) RYO cigarette smokers, with the 
remaining 22 949 (59.5%) classed as manufactured ciga-
rette smokers. Of past-year smokers, 36 185 (93.8%) were 
current smokers and provided data on their current moti-
vation to quit. A total of 13 368 (34.6%) had attempted to 
quit and provided data on the success and motives for the 
quit attempt.
Sociodemographic and smoking characteristics by RYO 
cigarette use among past-year, current and those who had 
attempted to quit in the last year are described in table 1. 
Of past-year smokers, RYO cigarette smokers were on 
average slightly younger and a higher proportion were 
men, from a lower social grade and from southern England 
than manufactured cigarette smokers (all p<0.001). RYO 
cigarette smokers reported slightly stronger urges to 
smoke (p<0.001) and smoked on average one cigarette 
per day more than manufactured cigarette smokers (13.0 
vs 11.9, p<0.001), but their weekly spend was only around 
half that of the manufactured cigarette smokers (£14.33 
vs £26.79, p<0.001). This pattern was similar among 
current cigarette smokers and those who had attempted 
to stop in the past year.
The results of the adjusted logistic regression models 
are shown in table 2. Relative to manufactured cigarette 
smokers, RYO cigarette smokers were significantly less 
likely to report high motivation to quit (15.9% vs 20.3%, 
OR=0.77, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.81) and were less likely to have 
made a serious quit attempt in the last 12 months (32.7% 
vs 35.9%, OR=0.87, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.91). However, among

those who had attempted to quit smoking, there was no 
significant difference in quit success according to type of 
cigarettes smoked, with a success rate of 13.7% among 
RYO cigarette smokers versus 15.3% among manufac-
tured cigarette smokers (OR=1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.12). 
Younger age, female sex and higher social grade were 
associated with greater odds of being motivated to, and 
attempting to, quit. Older age and higher social grade 
were associated with greater odds of quit success. There 
was little regional difference in quitting behaviour, with 
just increased odds of quit success among participants 
living in northern England. Survey year was negatively 
associated with odds of high motivation to quit and quit 
attempts but was not significantly related to quit success. 
This may reflect the impact of different tobacco control 
policy changes (eg, banning point of sale displays) at 
different times across the study period. Nicotine depen-
dence, assessed by self-reported strength of urges to 
smoke, was strongly associated with reduced odds of quit 
success.
Analysis of factors contributing to the most recent quit 
attempt among a subsample of smokers who had tried 
to quit in the last 12 months is shown in table 3. Data 
were available for 4891 RYO cigarette smokers and 7682 
manufactured cigarette smokers (95.6% and 93.1% of 
RYO and manufactured cigarette smokers who had made 
a quit attempt, respectively). RYO cigarette smokers were 
less likely than manufactured cigarette smokers to report 
a decision that smoking was too expensive as a motive 
(16.0% vs 22.0%, OR=0.68, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.74). Few 
smokers reported health warnings on cigarette packets 
had motivated their quit attempt, and there was no differ-
ence according to the type of cigarettes smoked (2.9% vs 
3.2%). Current and future health problems were more 
frequently cited as contributing factors, but it was RYO 
cigarette smokers who were more likely to report them 
as a motive for their most recent quit attempt (current 
health problems: 18.0% vs 13.9% in manufactured ciga-
rette smokers, OR=1.44, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.59; future 
health problems: 28.3% vs 24.9%, OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.06 
to 1.25).
We explored the possibility that the associations 
observed between RYO cigarette use and motivation to 
quit and quit attempts were mediated by spending on 
smoking (figure 1; as quit success was not associated with 
RYO use in analysis this was not investigated here). As 
shown in table 1, RYO cigarette use was associated with 
significantly lower mean weekly spending on smoking 
(path a in figure 1; p<0.001). Weekly spending on smoking 
was also positively associated with quit attempts (path b; 
p=0.027) but was not significantly associated with motiva-
tion to quit (p=0.533). Thus, mediation analysis was only 
carried out for quit attempts; results are summarised in 
table 4 (path c, path c′ and indirect effects in figure 1). 
There was a significant indirect effect of RYO cigarette 
use via weekly spend on smoking on the incidence of quit 
attempts (β=−0.02, SE=0.003, 95% CI −0.03 to −0.02) after 
adjusting for potential confounders. The effect ratio indi-
cated that weekly spend on smoking explained 100% of 
the total effect of RYO cigarette use on quit attempts. The 
direct effect of RYO cigarette use on quit attempts was not 
significant (β=−0.0003, SE=0.006).

Sensitivity analyses that excluded participants who 
reported smoking both manufactured and RYO cigarettes 
(n=2750) showed no notable differences in the pattern of 
results.
DIsCussIOn
The use of RYO cigarettes was associated with reduced 
motivation to quit smoking and a lower rate of quit 
attempts but was not significantly related to quit success. 
RYO users reported spending less each week on smoking 
than manufactured cigarette smokers and were less likely 
to cite cost as a trigger for attempting to stop smoking. 
Spending on smoking was not related to motivation 
to quit but was a strong mediator of the relationship 
between RYO use and lower incidence of quit attempts, 
fully explaining this association.
To our knowledge, no prior studies have examined 
degree of motivation to quit smoking in relation to RYO 
cigarette use. However, the ITC Four-Country Survey, 
which includes nationally representative cohorts of adult 
smokers from the USA, Canada, the UK and Australia, 
has assessed intention to quit using a dichotomous yes/
no measure. Comparison of RYO and manufactured 
cigarette smokers revealed lower odds of intending to 
quit smoking among RYO users in the UK and Austra-
lian samples,14 consistent with our finding that RYO ciga-
rette users were less likely to be highly motivated to quit. 
However, no significant difference was observed in the 
USA or Canada,14 which could be due to cross-national 
differences in tobacco control policies.
The incidence of quit attempts among RYO and manu-
factured cigarette smokers in our sample (33% and 36%, 
respectively) was comparable with results from the ITC 
Four-Country Survey (34% and 39%, respectively).21 
While in the ITC Four-Country Survey, the adjusted 
odds of making a quit attempt did not differ significantly 
according to RYO cigarette use, RYO cigarette smokers 
in our sample were significantly less likely to report a 
recent quit attempt even after adjustment for age, sex, 
social grade and geographic region. This difference 
may related to difference in the relative cost of RYO and 
manufactured cigarettes in different jurisdictions.
Rates of quit success were lower in the present sample 
(14% among RYO smokers and 15% among manufac-
tured cigarette smokers) than in the ITC Four-Country 
Survey (30% and 31%, respectively)21 or in a survey of 
users of Quitline, the largest smoking cessation provider 
in New Zealand (20% vs 21%).24 This may be due to differ-
ences in the characteristics of smokers between samples. 
The ITC Four-Country Survey is a longitudinal cohort 
study with a transparent focus on international tobacco 
control policy and may attract participants who are more 
interested in smoking cessation than the average smoker. 
The New Zealand sample was restricted to smokers who 
had received telephone counselling for smoking cessa-
tion, which is known to improve chances of quit success.30 
By contrast, our sample comprised different monthly 
random, representative samples of the English popula-
tion with no requirement for long-term involvement. 
Despite differences in the prevalence of quit success 
across studies, results consistently showed no relationship 
between RYO cigarette use and quit success among those 
who made a quit attempt.
With previous studies indicating that RYO cigarette 
smokers often perceive RYO cigarettes to be less harmful 
than manufactured cigarettes,19 we had expected health 
concerns to feature less prominently among RYO ciga-
rette smokers’ quit motives as compared with those 
who smoke manufactured cigarettes. However, results 
revealed the opposite; RYO cigarette smokers who had 
attempted to quit were more likely to report current 
and future health concerns as motives behind their most 
recent quit attempt. It could be that smokers with greater 
concerns about the impact of smoking on their health 
opt to smoke RYO cigarettes as an ineffective attempt to 
minimise harm.
The cost of smoking was a more prominent motive 
driving recent quit attempts among smokers of manu-
factured cigarettes than among RYO cigarette smokers. 
This is unsurprising given that the average RYO cigarette 
smoker in our sample smoked one more cigarette each 
day than the average manufactured cigarette smoker but 
reported a substantially lower weekly spend on smoking. 
Importantly, weekly spending on smoking was found 
to significantly mediate the association between RYO 
cigarette use and lower incidence of quit attempts, with 
results indicating that the reason RYO cigarette smokers 
are less likely to try to quit than those who smoke manu-
factured cigarettes is the fact that it costs them less. There 
is a clear need to address the gap in pricing between the 
most expensive and cheapest cigarettes if policies aiming 
to reduce smoking via price increases are to achieve their 
intended effect.
While the cost of smoking was of great importance in 
determining whether someone was likely to try to quit 
smoking, weekly spending on smoking was not related 
to motivation to quit smoking. This is interesting given 
that cost is the third most cited reason for wanting to quit 
smoking, after health and social concerns.31 Moreover, it 
is seemingly at odds with our finding that spending on 
smoking was positively associated with quit attempts and 
with previous studies showing that price increases reduce 
cigarette consumption.2–4 6 It is possible that increases in 
the price of cigarettes have little influence on whether a 
person wants to stop smoking, but rather make it unafford-
able to continue to smoke meaning they need to stop. The 
fact that younger and more socioeconomically disadvan-
taged smokers (groups that tend to have lower disposable 
incomes) are the most likely to quit in response to price 
increases5 7 is consistent with this hypothesis. The distinc-
tion between motivation and opportunity as drivers of 
behaviour is a central component of the COM-B model,32 
a framework that describes how interventions can change 
behaviour by influencing a person’s capability, oppor-
tunity and/or motivation. Furthermore, it could be

that cost may have a different impact on routes to quit, 
primarily increasing unplanned rather than planned quit 
attempts, which would explain the disconnect with moti-
vation observed here.
A major strength of this study was the use of a large, 
representative sample of the English population. While 
previous studies that have examined relations between 
RYO use and quitting behaviour have had sample sizes 
of <800 RYO users,21 24 our sample of >15 000 RYO users 
provided increased power to detect small effects. In addi-
tion, using aggregated data from monthly surveys span-
ning 9.5 years eliminated potential bias from seasonal 
differences in the rate of quit attempts.
The study had several limitations. First, we did not 
have complete data for all past-year smokers surveyed 
during the study period, and our analysed sample slightly 
over-represented smokers who were younger, from higher 
social grades and living in the north of England. Second, 
the assessment of the most recent quit attempt relied on 
recall of the last 12 months, introducing scope for bias. 
Third, quit success was measured by self-reported absti-
nence. In randomised trials, a lack of biochemical verifi-
cation would be a significant limitation because smokers 
who receive active treatment may feel social pressure to 
claim abstinence. However, in population surveys, the 
social pressure and associated rate of misreporting is low, 
and it is considered acceptable to use self-reported data.33
In conclusion, smokers who use RYO cigarette are 
less likely to be motivated to quit or to report having 
attempted to quit smoking than those who smoke manu-
factured cigarettes. However, RYO cigarette use appears 
to be unrelated to quit success among those who do make 
a serious quit attempt. The cost associated with smoking 
is a stronger driver of quit attempts among smokers of 
manufactured cigarettes and mediates the lower inci-
dence of quit attempts among RYO cigarette smokers. 
While these results provide additional evidence that 
increasing cigarette prices may encourage people to stop 
smoking, they also further demonstrate the potential 
undermining effects of the availability and use of cheap 
tobacco.
