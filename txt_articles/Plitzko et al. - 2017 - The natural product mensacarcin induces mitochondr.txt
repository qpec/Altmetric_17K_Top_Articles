Mensacarcin is a highly oxygenated polyketide that was first
isolated from soil-dwelling Streptomyces bacteria. It exhibits
potent cytostatic properties (mean of 50% growth inhibition �
0.2 �M) in almost all cell lines of the National Cancer Institute
(NCI)-60 cell line screen and relatively selective cytotoxicity
against melanoma cells. Moreover, its low COMPARE correla-
tions with known standard antitumor agents indicate a unique
mechanism of action. Effective therapies for managing mela-
noma are limited, so we sought to investigate mensacarcin’s
unique cytostatic and cytotoxic effects and its mode of action. By
assessing morphological and biochemical features, we demon-
strated that mensacarcin activates caspase-3/7–dependent apo-
ptotic pathways and induces cell death in melanoma cells. Upon
mensacarcin exposure, SK-Mel-28 and SK-Mel-5 melanoma
cells, which have the BRAFV600E mutation associated with drug
resistance, showed characteristic chromatin condensation as
well as distinct poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 cleavage. Flow
cytometry identified a large population of apoptotic melanoma
cells, and single-cell electrophoresis indicated that mensacarcin
causes genetic instability, a hallmark of early apoptosis. To visu-
alize mensacarcin’s subcellular localization, we synthesized a
fluorescent mensacarcin probe that retained activity. The natu-
ral product probe was localized to mitochondria within 20 min
of treatment. Live-cell bioenergetic flux analysis confirmed that
mensacarcin disturbs energy production and mitochondrial
function rapidly. The subcellular localization of the fluores-
cently labeled mensacarcin together with its unusual metabolic
effects in melanoma cells provide evidence that mensacarcin
targets mitochondria. Mensacarcin’s unique mode of action
suggests that it may be a useful probe for examining energy
metabolism, particularly in BRAF-mutant melanoma, and rep-
resent a promising lead for the development of new anticancer
drugs.
Historically, natural product discoveries have directly or
indirectly contributed to a large number of new drug leads. A
recent analysis of new medicines approved by the United States
Food and Drug Administration between 1981 and 2014
revealed that �50% of all small molecule pharmaceuticals were
based on natural products or derivatives thereof (1). Similarly,
numerous anticancer agents in current clinical use are based
on genetically encoded small molecules, including anticancer
drugs with DNA interaction properties like doxorubicin and
bleomycin and tubulin-acting metabolites like vincristine
and epothilone. Natural products with their unique structures
and properties continue to serve as an invaluable inspiration for
new drug entities.
Mensacarcin (1; see Fig. 2) is a highly oxidized and stereo-
genic complex molecule with potent antitumor activity.3 The
polyketide can be obtained in high yields from its producing
organism Streptomyces bottropensis (unoptimized yield of 50
mg/liter) and was named after the location where the soil sam-
ple originated, next to the university’
s cafeteria (“mensa” in
German). Its structure is related to the bioactive metabolite
cervicarcin isolated from Streptomyces ogaensis (3). Initial cyto-
toxic evaluation of mensacarcin revealed potent antitumor
activity comparable with that of doxorubicin, a clinically used
anticancer drug for the treatment of a broad spectrum of cancer
(4, 5). No total synthesis of mensacarcin has been published
thus far; however, related synthetic programs toward the highly
functionalized hexahydroanthracene backbone indicate the
importance of the epoxide moieties within mensacarcin for
antitumor activity (6–8). Indeed, semi-synthetic modifications
targeting the side chain epoxide revealed a correlation of cyto-
toxicity with the degree of oxidation in the side chain (9).
Detailed studies on mensacarcin’
s biosynthesis by Bechthold
and co-workers (10) enabled the heterologous expression of
mensacarcin’
s biosynthetic gene cluster to yield 1 and ana-
logues. Its biogenesis entails several unusual enzyme activities,
among them a new mechanism of epoxide formation in
polyketides (9, 11). Mensacarcin was submitted to the NCI-60
human tumor cell line screen and showed strong anti-prolifer-
ative effects in all tested cell lines and low COMPARE correla-
tions to known anticancer agents (12). Given the encouraging
cytostatic and cytotoxic responses induced by mensacarcin in
the NCI in vitro cell assay, the present study aims to examine
mensacarcin’
s cellular mode of action. In 2017, it is estimated
that there will be 87,100 new cases of melanoma in the United
States and 9,730 deaths from the disease (13). Classical chemo-
therapy regimens confer only very low success rates with a
median survival rate of 8 � 2 months for patients with stage IV
melanoma (14, 15). Melanoma genetics revealed that 50% of
fast progressing melanomas contain a mutation in the gene that

 encodes B-Raf, which leads to constitutive activation of down-
stream signaling in the mitogen-activated protein kinase path-
way (16). The BRAF V600E mutation is a hallmark for high-risk
melanoma associated with shortened patient survival rates and
tumor drug resistance (17, 18), and B-Raf has emerged as a
validated target for melanoma intervention. B-Raf inhibitors
like vemurafenib and dabrafenib show immense short-term
tumor repression. However, chemoresistance is quickly acquired
by the tumor, and disease relapse within several months is com-
monly observed. These limited treatment options indicate a
need for new anti-melanoma drug leads with alternative tar-
gets, which could potentially be used in combination therapies
to overcome intrinsic or acquired resistance to combat BRAF-
mutant melanoma (18, 19). Mensacarcin’
s unique response
pattern in the NCI-60 screen and pronounced selective cyto-
toxicity against the melanoma cell line panel motivated us to
evaluate and characterize the biological effects in selected cell
lines and explore its mode of action further. Considering the
limited availability of effective therapies for melanoma, we are
seeking to investigate mensacarcin’
s potential as an antitumor
drug lead. In this study, we use a combination of molecular and
cell-based assays to provide insights into the mechanism of
mensacarcin-induced growth inhibition and cell death. We
demonstratethatmensacarcinactivatescaspase-dependentapo-
ptotic pathways and induces cell death with relative selectivity
against melanoma cells. In addition, our results indicate that
the target of mensacarcin is located in mitochondria and affects
mitochondrial function in an atypical manner.
Results
Analysis of the NCI-60 cancer cell line screen
The growth inhibitory and cytotoxic activity patterns of
mensacarcin in the NCI-60 cell line screen were evaluated using
mean graphs illustrating the mean of 50% growth inhibition
(GI50)4 and 50% lethal concentration (LC50) of all tested cancer
cell lines versus the response of the individual cell line (Fig. 1).
Mensacarcin exhibits uniformly strong growth inhibition in all
tested cell lines with a mean GI50 of 0.2 �M (Fig. 1A) with renal
cell line SN12C being especially sensitive. COMPARE analysis
of the GI50 data set revealed no correlation between mensacar-
cin and compounds from the NCI Developmental Therapeutics
Program standard agent database of 170 compounds (correla-
tion � 0.3). The COMPARE algorithm ranks compounds by
similarity of response patterns, which can give an indication of
a similar mechanisms of action (12, 20). Interestingly, mensac-
arcin displays a unique pattern of growth inhibition with no
known similarity to other agents, which has been referred to as
“COMPARE-negative.”Besides its strong universal anti-prolif-
erative effect, most cell lines treated with mensacarcin did not
reach the LC50 with the highest concentration tested (100 �M)
(Fig. 1B). The strongest responding cell lines in the mean log
LC50 analysis were the melanoma panel with an average LC50 of
10 �M, RPMI-8226 (leukemia), NCI-H522 (non-small lung
cell), COLO205 (colon), SNB-75 (CNS), A498 (renal), and
MDA-N (breast). Given mensacarcin’
s relative selective cyto-
toxicity to melanoma cells in the NCI-60 screen, subsequent
experiments were focused on two melanoma cell lines (SK-
Mel-5 and SK-Mel-28) that gave distinct responses. We also
selected a colon cancer carcinoma (HCT-116) as a representa-
tive non-responsive cell line.
Mensacarcin exhibits general cytostatic but cell type–specific
cytotoxic effects
Lethality of compounds in the NCI cancer screen is indirectly
examined by measurement of total cellular protein at the
beginning of the assay and at the end of the 48-h treatment
using sulforhodamine B (https://dtp.cancer.gov/discovery_de-
velopment/nci-60/methodology.htm)5 (21). The present study
sought to examine growth inhibition and cell fate induced by
mensacarcin in selected cancer cell lines in a direct and com-
prehensive manner. We chose two representatives from the
NCI melanoma cell line panel (SK-Mel-28 and SK-Mel-5 cells)
to characterize mensacarcin’
s efficacy against malignant mela-
nomas and compared its activity against HCT-116 colon carci-
noma cells. SK-Mel-5 and SK-Mel-28 are both well-character-
ized melanoma cell line models with a BRAF V600E mutation.
Eight of the nine NCI-60 melanoma cell lines carry the BRAF
mutation, with SK-Mel-2 being the exception. All melanomas
were responsive in the NCI LC50 assay, with SK-Mel-28 being
the least responsive cell line in the panel. As illustrated in Fig.
2B, both melanoma cells and HCT-116 colon cancer cells
treated with mensacarcin show strong reduction in cell density
and morphological changes. Cell viability was monitored and
quantitatively assessed via measuring reduction of 3-(4,5-dim-
ethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) by
viable cells to a purple formazan. Mensacarcin concentrations
as low as 0.5 �M induced strong, concentration-dependent
growth inhibition after 24 h in melanoma cells and in HCT-116
colon cancer cells (Fig. 2C). Next, we investigated the effect of
mensacarcin treatment on membrane integrity of cells. The
loss of membrane integrity is a distinct sign of necrotic cell
death and results in release of LDH into the extracellular
matrix. Our results demonstrated that mensacarcin induced
concentration- and time-dependent cell death in the two tested
melanoma cell lines, concurrent with growth inhibition but
only moderate LDH release. Interestingly, HCT-116 colon car-
cinoma cells are strongly inhibited by mensacarcin in the cell
viability assay but do not show signs of cell death in the LDH
cytotoxicity assays when treated with mensacarcin. In accord-
ance to the initial NCI-60 cancer screen, our data demonstrate
that mensacarcin induced universal strong cytostasis indepen-
dent of cancer type, but cell death was only observed in mela-
noma cells.
Initial evidence for apoptosis in SK-Mel-28 cells that were
exposed to mensacarcin was observed by confocal microscopy.

 Hoechst staining was used to visualize nuclei and their mor-
phological changes via fluorescence microscopy in cells upon
exposure to mensacarcin (Fig. 3A). Changes in nuclear mor-
phology included chromatin condensation. We also observed
various characteristic stages of apoptotic nuclear disassembly,
including formation of spherical aggregates along the nuclear
lamina, formation of necklace-shaped rings, shrinking of the
nucleus, and nuclear collapse (22) (Fig. 3A, c and d). Moreover,
the use of ER-Tracker revealed that mensacarcin-treated mel-
anoma cells showed cytotoxic responses, including detachment
and cell shrinkage. In contrast to the melanoma cells, no
nuclear alterations or other signs of apoptosis were observed in
HCT-116 cells treated with mensacarcin (Fig. 3A, f).
Given the observed cytotoxicity, we then tested the ability of
mensacarcin to induce activation of apoptotic signaling path-
ways. A characteristic event in apoptosis is the proteolytic acti-
vation of the caspase cascade, eventually resulting in the initia-
tion of downstream apoptosis-executing processes. Effector
caspases like caspase-3 and -7 cleave the nuclear enzyme
poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1) into specific 89- and
24-kDa fragments. PARP-1 is generally activated during DNA
damage and initiates DNA repair; however, during apoptosis,
caspase-mediated cleavage of PARP-1 inhibits DNA repair
mechanisms, eventually leading to DNA fragmentation (23,
24). The proteolytic activation of procaspases and the presence
of the specific 89-kDa PARP fragment are therefore considered
hallmarks of apoptosis. Although not well understood, caspase-
independent as well as PARP-1–independent programmed
cell death has been described (23, 25). Melanoma cells were
exposed to increasing mensacarcin concentrations for 6–48 h,
and activation of caspase-3 and subsequent cleavage of PARP-1
was investigated by immunoblot analysis. Mensacarcin con-
centrations of 0.5–1 �M or greater induced the formation of
89-kDa PARP-1 fragments as well as caspase-3 activation in
SK-Mel-28 and SK-Mel-5 beginning between 6 and 15 h after
exposure (Fig. 3B). Cleavage of the pro-apoptotic proteins

 could not be observed in HCT-116 cells after 48 h of
treatment.
Next, we examined SK-Mel-5 cells for mensacarcin-trig-
gered DNA damage as a sign of early apoptosis by an alkaline
comet assay. This single-cell gel electrophoresis technique
allows detection of DNA-altering lesions, including DNA sin-
gle-strand breaks or double-strand breaks, or indicates incom-
plete excision repair (26). Mensacarcin treatment for 6 or 15 h
induced a significant dose-dependent increase of DNA in the
comet tail (Fig. 3C). The early onset of DNA damage is surpris-
ing, and the amount of DNA fragmentation increases in cells
with a longer incubation time of 15 h. The comet assay verifies
that mensacarcin treatment leads to genomic instability in SK-
Mel-5 cells, a classic hallmark of early apoptotic onset (27).
Verification of caspase-dependent apoptosis in melanoma
cells and release of cytochrome c
To provide some insight into the potential mechanism of
mensacarcin-induced cell death, we tested the ability of men-
sacarcin to activate the downstream effector caspases of the
major apoptotic signaling pathways: caspase-3 and caspase-7.
Mensacarcin induced activation of caspase-3 and -7 in SK-
Mel-28 and SK-Mel-5 cells over a time frame consistent with
loss of cell viability (12 and 24 h) but did not induce caspase-
dependent cell death in HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells (Fig. 4).
In control experiments, we found that treatment with the
broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (28) (10 �M)
alone produced no significant change in the viability of either
SK-Mel-28, SK-Mel-5, or HCT-116 cells as determined by
caspase activation assays (Fig. 4). Co-treatment of cells with
mensacarcin and Z-VAD-FMK attenuated mensacarcin-in-
duced caspase activation at all tested mensacarcin concentra-
tions (Fig. 4). These results indicate that mensacarcin activates
caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways in melanoma cells.
Taken together, we found that mensacarcin induces caspase
and PARP activation, DNA damage, and changes in nuclear
morphology, which strongly suggests that mensacarcin induces
cell death through apoptotic pathways.

 Mitochondrially mediated programmed cell death can be
monitored by the release of the apoptogenic factor cytochrome
c from the mitochondria into the cytosol (29). We treated SK-
Mel-5 cells for 6 h with 50 �M mensacarcin and 10 �M stauro-
sporine, a known inducer of mitochondrial apoptosis. Cells
were lysed and fractionated using differential centrifugation
to obtain a cytosolic fraction for immunoblot analysis. The
Western blot result indicated that cytochrome c was released
from the mitochondria into the cytosol for the mensacarcin
and staurosporine treatment (Fig. 5). Notably, in melanoma
cells, mensacarcin was an order of magnitude more potent in
rapid induction of apoptotic pathways than the anticancer
agent doxorubicin (data not shown).
Mensacarcin represents a unique chemical scaffold with nine
stereogenic centers and two epoxide groups that could be prone
to nucleophilic attack by nucleobases (30). Various conditions
to covalently bind mensacarcin with DNA were tested, but no
DNA-mensacarcin adducts formed with either calf thymus
DNA or single nucleobases or in isolated DNA from treated
melanoma cells could be detected via LC-MS analysis. Direct
binding to immobilized double-stranded DNA on a biosensor
platform via biolayer interferometry (31) was successful for

 other DNA-acting molecules (ethidium bromide, doxorubicin,
Hoechst 33342), but no specific binding event could be detected
for mensacarcin (data not shown). Additionally, we investi-
gated mensacarcin’
s ability to intercalate DNA, but mensacar-
cin was not able to replace known intercalators from isolated
DNA (32). We conclude that mensacarcin does not intercalate
or alkylate DNA.
Effects on the cell cycle by mensacarcin-treated melanoma
cells
To further examine the mechanism of action of mensacarcin,
the cell cycle distribution was investigated by flow cytometric
analysis of propidium iodide (PI)-stained cells. Consistent with
our immunoblot analysis and fluorescence microscopy results,
increasing mensacarcin concentrations resulted in a dose-de-
pendent increase in apoptotic cells with hypodiploid DNA con-
tent for SK-Mel-28 and SK-Mel-5 cells (sub-G1 population) but
produced only a minor increase of the sub-G1 population in
HCT-116 cells (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, the phase distribution of
the remaining cells did not change significantly in the presence
of mensacarcin in melanoma cells, whereas in HCT-116 cells,
a moderate S-/G2-phase arrest could be observed (Fig. 6A).
Depending on their mechanism of action, many known anti-
cancer agents induce a phase-specific cell cycle arrest. For
example, the DNA-acting reagents doxorubicin and etoposide
both arrest cells mainly in G2 phase (33, 34). Mensacarcin, in
contrast, induced only a modest shift in the cell cycle distribu-
tion. We examined the effect of mensacarcin on synchronized
SK-Mel-5 cells; however, we found that mensacarcin does not
arrest cells in a specific phase but found induction of apoptosis

(0.5, 2, 10, and 50 �M), vehicle (DMSO), or the positive control staurosporine (10 �M). We also tested the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK alone (10
�M) and in combination with mensacarcin (0.5, 2, 10, and 50 �M), respectively. In all cases, the caspase-activating activity of mensacarcin was attenuated by
Z-VAD-FMK. Caspase-3/7 activity was measured at the end of each treatment using a luminescence-based assay coupled with automated luminescence

Rhodamine-labeled mensacarcin induces apoptotic cell death
in melanoma cells
We next sought to determine the subcellular compartment
targeted by mensacarcin. To monitor its localization in live cells
via fluorescence microscopy, we synthesized a rhodamine-la-
beled mensacarcin probe. Rhodamine was linked to mensacar-
cin using tetramethylrhodamine-5-carbonyl azide (TMRCA)
following established protocols (35). Upon heating TMRCA to
80 °
C, the azide group undergoes a Curtius rearrangement to
yield the isocyanide group, which instantly reacts with mensa-
carcin’
s hydroxyl groups to form the carbamate-linked
conjugate (TMR-mensa) (36, 37) (Fig. 7A). After 1 h, three pre-
dominant products with combined rhodamine- and mensacar-
cin-specific spectroscopic features (absorbance at 545 and 330
nm, respectively) were found in the reaction mixture, indicat-
ing that all three secondary hydroxyl groups of 1 were utilized.
The rhodamine-mensacarcin conjugates were purified via
HPLC separation and analyzed by high-resolution mass spec-
trometry and UV properties. Only singly labeled mensacarcin
probes were observed and combined for application in micros-
copy studies. TMR-mensa also showed growth inhibition and
cytotoxicity properties that were similar to unlabeled mensac-
arcin. In SK-Mel-5 cells, growth was inhibited starting at 1.0 �M
TMR-mensa (versus 0.5 �M mensacarcin), and LDH release was
induced with 1.5 �M TMR-mensa (versus 0.5 �M mensacarcin)
(Fig. 7B). Caspase-mediated cleavage of PARP-1 and induction
of apoptosis could be detected after 15 h with 5 �M TMR-mensa
(versus 1 �M with mensacarcin) (Fig. 7C).
Rhodamine-labeled mensacarcin localizes in mitochondria
To study the subcellular distribution of TMR-mensa, SK-
Mel-5 cells were incubated with the fluorescent probe for 20
min and co-stained with markers for the nucleus, endoplasmic
reticulum, and mitochondria. Confocal fluorescence micros-
copy confirmed a quick uptake of TMR-mensa into the cells. A
general hazy background of rhodamine fluorescence through-
out the cell indicated some nonspecific binding and/or excess
of fluorescence probe. SK-Mel-5 cells adopt a heterogeneous
cell population ranging from smaller cells with tightly packed
organelles to widespread cells with defined structures that
enable the distribution pattern for TMR-mensa to be readily
visualized. Interestingly, TMR-mensa is strictly excluded from
the nucleus and does not co-localize with the nuclear Hoechst
stain (Pearson correlation r � �0.30) (Fig. 8, A and B). This
stands in strong contrast to TMRCA, the uncoupled rhodamine
dye, which does accumulate in the nucleus (Fig. 8C). This result
supports our previous findings that mensacarcin does not
directly interact with nuclear DNA. In addition, the fluores-
cence imaging studies indicated that TMR-mensa substantially
co-localizes with the mitochondrial marker. This is particularly
evident in cell areas with well-defined cellular compartments
(Fig. 8A). A Pearson correlation of r � 0.61 (r � 0.73 in well-
defined areas; Fig. 8A (inset)) provides statistical evidence for a

rescence. It is possible that these fluorescent features corre-
spond to activity-independent accumulation of TMR-mensa in
endosomal/lysosomal compartments, which are known to trap
tetramethylrhodamine in the acidic lysosomal lumen. Addi-
tionally, rhodamine dyes are known to show enhanced fluores-
cence at lower pH values such that acidic compartments are
stained more brightly (38). The mitochondrial localization of
TMR-mensa observed through imaging was also supported by
subcellular fractionation studies. Using differential centrifuga-
tion, we obtained an enriched mitochondrial fraction, a crude
light membrane fraction, and a cytosolic fraction from TMR-
mensa–treated cells. As shown in Fig. 8D, rhodamine fluores-
cence is enriched in the mitochondrial fraction of SK-Mel-5
cells after 15 h of mensacarcin treatment and less abundant
in the light membrane fraction (lysosomes, peroxisomes, and
microsomes) and cytosolic fraction. Similar trends were already
observed after a 30-min incubation with mensacarcin (data not
shown). The fluorescence of the TMR-mensa probe is not
exclusively found in mitochondria; therefore, we cannot
exclude the possibility that non-mitochondrial compartments
may also contribute to the overall activity of mensacarcin. The
present study does show that TMR-mensa is significantly
enriched in mitochondria, suggesting that mensacarcin’
s prin-
cipal site of action may be located in this compartment.
Mensacarcin causes mitochondrial stress in melanoma cells
Based on the co-localization studies, we identified mitochon-
dria as the major compartment labeled by our fluorescent-men-
sacarcin probe. This indicates that mensacarcin’
s universal
cytostatic and potent cell type–specific cytotoxic properties
might be derived from interference with mitochondrial activity.
To investigate the effect of mensacarcin on mitochondrial
function and cellular bioenergetics, we monitored cellular oxy-
gen consumption rates (OCR) and extracellular acidification
rates (ECAR) in real time as measures of mitochondrial respi-
ration and glycolysis, respectively. Using a Seahorse extracellu-
lar flux analyzer, we assessed the energy metabolism of SK-Mel-
28, SK-Mel-5, and HCT-116 cells before and after exposure to
mensacarcin. On melanoma cells, mensacarcin had a pro-
nounced effect. The addition of mensacarcin induced a con-
centration-dependent reduction of basal OCR in both mela-
noma cell lines. With exposure to 50 �M mensacarcin, oxidative
consumption decreased rapidly in the first 5 min of exposure
and stabilized at 48% of the baseline in SK-Mel-28 and 74% in
SK-Mel-5 after 60 min. The addition of the control, ATP-syn-
thase inhibitor oligomycin (1 �M in well), which suppresses
ATP production and reduces oxidative phosphorylation to the
minimum necessary to balance proton leak, lowered OCR to

 �30% of the baseline value. In contrast, mensacarcin had a
minimal effect on oxygen consumption in HCT-116 cells,
reducing the OCR only to 85% of control values at the highest
dose tested (Fig. 9A). This is consistent with previous assays
that showed that this colon carcinoma cell line is relatively
insensitive to mensacarcin. For comparison, colon cancer cells
were responsive to the ATP-synthase inhibitor oligomycin (1
�M in well), which lowered OCR to �18% of the baseline.
In addition to measuring the OCR, we also measured the
effects of mensacarcin and oligomycin on media acidification
(ECAR). In agreement with numerous prior studies, oligomycin
produced an increase in ECAR that represents a compensatory
increase in glycolysis (39). Consistent with our previous assays
and OCR measurements, mensacarcin had a modest effect on
ECAR in HCT-116 cells. However, interestingly, mensacarcin
had distinct but variable effects on ECAR in melanoma cells. In
contrast to oligomycin, mensacarcin did not induce a compen-
satory increase in glycolysis. Low concentrations of mensacar-
cin (2 �M) yielded ECAR responses similar to control, whereas
higher concentrations (50 �M) produced slight decreases in the
acidification rate in melanoma cells. These results suggest com-
plex concentration-dependent effects on cell glycolysis and lac-
tate formation.
To gain further insight into the mensacarcin-induced mito-
chondrial impairment in melanoma cells, we assessed key
parameters of mitochondrial function by consecutively expos-
ing cells to well-described mitochondria-perturbing reagents in
a so-called mitochondria stress test. Following the addition of
mensacarcin, we sequentially added oligomycin, FCCP, and,
last, rotenone and antimycin A. This well-established protocol
provides information on basal respiration, ATP-linked respira-
tion, proton leak, maximal respiration capacity, and non-mito-
chondrial respiration. As shown in Fig. 9B, basal respiration
is lowered dose-dependently by treatment with mensacarcin,
suggesting a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation. Oligomy-
cin inhibits ATP synthase and reduces OCR, FCCP uncouples
oxygen consumption from ATP production and raises OCR to
a maximal value, and antimycin A and rotenone target the elec-
tron transport chain and reduce OCR to a minimal value. Men-
sacarcin affects the mitochondrial function of cells with a dis-
tinct bioenergetic signature. The rapid and substantial decrease
in OCR upon the addition of mensacarcin suggests that men-
sacarcin targets a pathway that is critical to oxidative phosphor-
ylation (Fig. 9B). However, because the addition of oligomycin
produced a further decrease in OCR in all cases, it appears that
mensacarcin has either an incomplete effect or that it targets a
modulatory pathway. Furthermore, because FCCP addition
caused OCR to return to near control levels (the difference
between post-FCCP and post-rotenone/antimycin A OCR is
unaltered), mensacarcin does not appear to directly target a
protein that is necessary for the electron transport chain. Con-
sistent with this interpretation, known electron transport chain
inhibitors (e.g. BAY 87-2243 (40), apoptolodins (41), and rote-
none/antimycin A (42)) produce a decrease in OCR that cannot
be rescued by the addition of FCCP. The effects of mensacarcin
on ECAR also provide valuable insights into its consequences
for mitochondrial function. Small molecules that inhibit ATP
synthase, like oligomycin, produce a characteristic, compensa-
tory increase in glycolysis that is observable as an increase in
ECAR. In contrast, mensacarcin produced no such increase in
ECAR. At high concentrations, mensacarcin appeared to have
the opposite effect, producing a decrease in ECAR. Such a
decrease in ECAR has been observed in response to compounds
that inhibit glycolysis (e.g. phloretin, deoxyglucose, and dichlo-
roacetate) (43). These results may suggest that mensacarcin
does not directly target the electron transport chain or ATP-
synthase but instead targets a pathway that produces precur-
sors for oxidative phosphorylation (e.g. glycolysis), targets
proteins that support mitochondrial health, or targets compo-
nents of a regulatory pathway. In addition to their role in cellular

(excitation, 530 nm; emission, 590 nm). The enrichment of mitochondria in
the mitochondrial fraction and the absence of mitochondria in the light
membrane and cytosolic fractions was analyzed by immunoblot analysis
using cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX IV) as mitochondrial marker. The
enrichment of cytosolic proteins in the cytosolic fraction was analyzed using

 pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family not
only can prompt the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway but also
can induce mitochondrial failure (44).
Therefore, it will be interesting to investigate the impact of
mensacarcin on direct mitochondrial acting pro-apoptotic fac-
tors in the future. Given its effects on mitochondrial function,
we considered whether the selectivity of mensacarcin for differ-
ent cell lines might correlate with metabolic traits of those lines.
Cancer cells often show substantial alterations in their meta-
bolic pathways. Many cancer cells have elevated glucose uptake
rates and increased aerobic glycolysis, first described by Otto
Warburg (45), whereas other tumors demonstrate an increase
in mitochondrial energy metabolism (46). Some of these differ-
ences can be captured by the OCR/ECAR ratio, which indicates
the rate of oxidative respiration relative to glycolysis. It is inter-
esting to note that melanoma cells are both relatively sensitive
to mensacarcin and that these same cell lines have relatively low
OCR/ECAR ratios (Fig. 9C). The increased dependence on gly-
colysis is especially prominent in BRAF-driven tumorigenesis
(39, 47). Consistent with this trend, we found that melanoma
cells are more sensitive to mensacarcin and exhibit lower
OCR/ECAR ratios compared with HCT-116 (Fig. 9C).
Although only correlative, this may suggest a mechanism for
the cell type selectivity of mensacarcin.

isolated from a soil-dwelling Streptomyces, showed potent uni-

 versal anti-proliferative effects in all tested cancer cell lines in
the NCI-60 cell line panel as well as in our in vitro assays. Cyto-
stasis is accompanied by fast progression into cell death in only
a few cell lines, notably in melanoma cell lines. Subsequent
experiments demonstrated that in melanoma cells, mensacarin
activates caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways. We also
observed early markers of apoptosis, including DNA damage
measured using a comet assay (6 h post-exposure) and nuclear
alterations visualized with confocal microscopy (15 h post-ex-
posure). Chemical coupling of mensacarcin with a rhodamine
dye yielded a fluorescent probe that localized to mitochondria
within 20 min of exposure. Metabolic flux analysis of mensac-
arcin-treated melanoma cells revealed changes in oxidative
consumption rate within minutes of exposure, consistent with a
mitochondria-perturbing mode of action.
In recent years, mitochondria have emerged as a potential
target for anticancer therapy as cancer cell mitochondria are
structurally and functionally different from their non-cancer-
ous counterparts (48). Resistance to apoptotic stimuli, inactiva-
tion of the tumor suppressor protein p53, and overexpression
of the proto-oncogene Bcl-2 are commonly seen traits in neo-
plasia. Mitochondria play a pivotal role in cell death signaling,
and small molecules that can selectively target mitochondria

chondrial respiration is up-regulated in response to vemurafenib
treatment in melanoma cells and reagents like mensacarcin that
alter mitochondrial respiration may be good candidates for drug
combination therapy.
In conclusion, this study shows that mensacarcin strongly
inhibits cell growth universally in human cancer cell lines and
potently induces apoptosis in melanoma cells. Our results indi-
cate that mensacarcin localizes to mitochondria, affects energy
metabolism in mitochondria, and activates caspase-dependent
apoptotic pathways. Because mensacarcin is produced in high
titers by S. bottropensis, it is possible to perform in vivo com-
pound evaluations, and initial studies show that mensacarcin is
well tolerated in mice, with a maximum tolerated dose of 30
mg/kg/day (i.p.) being most effective after 0, 3, and 7 days
(Oncotest Freiburg, now Charles River Laboratories). Our
results suggest that mesacarcin acts via a unique and rapid

 Cell cytotoxicity assay
Cell cytotoxicity was determined by measuring the extent of
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release of cells (50). Cell were
plated into 96-well plates and maintained overnight before
treatment was started with the addition of mensacarcin. After
the designated time, LDH activity of the cell supernatant was
measured. Briefly, 50 �l of supernatant of each well was trans-
ferred to a new well plate, and 50 �l of iodonitrotetrazolium-
lactate mix was added (100 �l of iodonitrotetrazolium solution
(25 mg/ml in DMSO), 100 �l of phenazine methosulfate solu-
tion (7.75 mg/ml in PBS), 2.3 ml of NAD� (2.8 mg/ml in PBS),
and 2.5 ml of lithium lactate solution (150 mM lithium lactate in
50 mM Tris, pH 8.5). Well plates were incubated for 15 min at
room temperature in the dark, and the reaction was stopped by
the addition of 50 �l of 1 M acetic acid. Absorbance was mea-
sured at 490 nm. LDH activity of lysed vehicle-treated cells
(0.5% DMSO unless otherwise stated) was defined as 100% cell
cytotoxicity. To lyse vehicle-treated cells, lysis solution (0.9%
(v/v) Triton X-100) was added to the cell culture medium, and
cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °
C before the assay was
performed.
Western blot analysis
For extraction of total cellular protein, cells were detached,
and culture medium and cells were collected by centrifugation.
Pellets were washed with PBS and resuspended in ice-cold lysis
buffer (1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH
8.0, protease inhibitor mixture) and kept for 20 min on ice.
After a 20-s sonication, cell lysates were cleared by centrifuga-
tion. The supernatant contained the total cellular protein
extract. Protein concentrations were determined using the
BCA protein assay kit from Pierce according to the manufactu-
rer’
s instructions. Lysates were mixed with Laemmli loading
buffer and incubated for 6 min at 95 °
C. The same amount of
protein for each cell lysate was loaded and separated by SDS-
PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred
onto Hybond-P PVDF membranes (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St
Giles, UK). Membranes were blocked in TBST (20 mM Tris, 140
mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.6) containing 5% (w/v)
milk powder and incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °
C
overnight and then washed with TBST. The membranes were
incubated with HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. After wash-
ing with TBST, membranes were developed with ECL reagent
(2 ml of luminol solution (1.25 mM luminol, 100 mM Tris, pH
8.6), 1 �l of 30% H2O2, 200 �l of p-coumaric acid (1.1 mg/ml in
DMSO)) and imaged with a ChemiDocTMMP imaging system
(Bio-Rad). For application of multiple antibodies, the same
blot was probed repeatedly or simultaneously with multiple
antibodies once the possibility of false interpretation of non-
specific binding was eliminated through validation. Protein
levels were quantified by densitometric measurements using
ImageJ software (51). The intensity of each band was nor-
malized to the loading control and quantified relative to the
vehicle control.
Assessment of nuclear morphology with fluorescence staining
Cells were plated in glass bottom 24-well plates (MatTek
Corp., Ashland, MA) and maintained overnight before treat-
ment was started. Hoechst staining was used to detect changes
in chromatin morphology as a typical characteristic of apopto-
sis (22). A stock solution of Hoechst 33342 was prepared in
water. ER-Tracker Green fluorescence stain was used to visual-
ize the endoplasmic reticulum. After 14 h of treatment, aliquots
of the stains were directly added to the culture medium (0.001%
(w/v) Hoechst and 1 �M ER-Tracker). After incubating for 15
min at 37 °
C, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 2 min at
37 °
C. Cells were then carefully washed twice with PBS. Nuclear
chromatin was afterward evaluated in PBS by inverted confocal
fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss LSM 780, Oberkochen, Ger-
many) using Zen 2 Software.
Single-cell gel electrophoresis
The alkaline comet assay was performed to detect DNA
strand breaks in single cells based on the method described by
Singh et al. (52). SK-Mel-5 cells were plated in 6-well plates,
maintained overnight, and treated with mensacarcin for 6 or
15 h. Cells were detached, and cell suspensions were centri-
fuged for 10 min at 1000 � g and washed once with PBS. 75,000
cells were resuspended in 70 �l of molten 0.5% low-melting
point agarose and pipetted onto a glass microscope slide (pre-
coated in 1% normal melting point agarose), spread with a cov-
erglass, and allowed to solidify on ice. After removal of the
coverglass, another layer of low-melting point agarose was
added on top, spread with a coverglass, and allowed to solidify
on ice. Then the coverglass was removed, and the slide was
immersed into cold lysis solution (10 mM Tris, 100 mM EDTA,
2.5 M NaCl, pH 10.0, 1% Triton X-100, 10% DMSO) for 1 h at
4 °
C. Slides were carefully rinsed with H2O, transferred to the
gel electrophoresis tank, and incubated in cold electrophoresis
buffer (300 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA) for 30 min. The electro-
phoresis was then run in the same buffer at 25 V (0.8 V/cm) for
30 min at 4 °
C. After electrophoresis, slides were neutralized
with Tris buffer (0.4 M Tris, pH 7.5) and then carefully washed
with H2O. Slides were stained with 60 �l of ethidium bromide
(10 �g/ml) and covered with a coverglass. For each sample, two
slides were prepared, and images were captured with a Nikon
E400 fluorescence microscope. For each slide, 50 cells were
randomly analyzed, and comets were scored using Comet
Assay IV analysis software (Perceptive Instruments, Bury St.
Edmunds, UK). DNA damage was quantified as percentage of
DNA in the comet tail.
Cell cycle analysis and Nicoletti apoptosis assay
Flow cytometric cell cycle analysis was performed using PI
DNA staining. Briefly, cells were plated in 12-well plates, main-
tained overnight, and directly treated with mensacarcin or
synchronized before treatment. For synchronization in G0/G1
phase, SK-Mel-5 cells were serum-starved for 26 h following
release into serum-containing culture medium with or without
mensacarcin. For synchronization in S-phase, a double thymi-
dine block modified from the method described by Ma and
Poon was carried out (53). SK-Mel-5 cells were treated with 2
mM thymidine for 24 h and released from the block for 9 h,
followed by a second thymidine block for 23 h. This arrested
cells at the G1/S-phase border. A release into complete culture
medium for 3 h led to a synchronized population in S phase.

 After treatment with mensacarcin, the culture medium was
collected. For detachment, cells were incubated for 2 min with
trypsin/EDTA at 37 °
C, carefully singularized by pipetting, and
added to the collected culture medium. Cell suspensions were
centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 � g, washed once, and resus-
pended in 600 �l of cold PBS. Cells were fixed by slowly adding
1400 �l of ice-cold 100% ethanol and incubation at �20 °
C for
30 min. Cells were pelleted, washed once with cold PBS, and
resuspended in 500 �l of PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and
RNase A (10 �g/ml), following staining with PI (20 �g/ml) for
15 min at 37 °
C in the dark. Cell suspensions were then analyzed
by flow cytometry using a Cytomics FC500 flow cytometer
(Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). For each measurement, at least
10,000 events were counted. Apoptosis was analyzed according
to Nicoletti et al. (2, 54) by determining the percentage of cells
with hypodiploid DNA content. Analysis was performed using
WinList 3D version 7.1 software (Verity Software House, Top-
sham, ME).
Cytochrome c release
Approximately 2 � 106 SK-Mel-5 cells were seeded in
96-well clear-bottom plates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC).
Cells were treated for 6 h with mensacarcin (50 �M). Staurospo-
rine (10 �M) served as positive control, and DMSO (10 �l)
served as vehicle control.
Subcellular fractionation
For cell fractionation, cells were washed twice with PBS and
collected. The cell pellet was resuspended in 170 �l of hypo-
osmotic buffer (10 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris, pH
7.5) and left on ice for 10 min. The cell suspension was trans-
ferred into a prechilled 2-ml Dounce homogenizer, and cells
were disrupted using 50 strokes of a tight B pestle followed by
the addition of 100 �l of 2.5� iso-osmotic buffer (0.625 M
sucrose, 2.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, pro-
tease inhibitor mixture). The homogenate was centrifuged at
700 � g for 10 min to pellet intact cells, nuclei, and cell debris.
The supernatant was further subjected to a 17,000 � g (for
cytochrome c release assay) or 7000 � g (for the co-localization
study) centrifugation step for 15 min to obtain the mitochon-
drial pellet. The pellet was resuspended in 1� iso-osmotic
buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM Tris, pH
7.5, protease inhibitor mixture) and centrifuged a second time
at 17,000 � g or 7000 � g. The mitochondrial pellet was then
resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer, resulting in the mitochon-
drial fraction. For the cytochrome c assay, the post-mitochon-
drial supernatant was obtained as the cytosolic fraction. For the
co-localization study, the post-mitochondrial supernatant was
centrifuged at 100,000 � g for 20 min to obtain the light mem-
brane pellet and the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resus-
pended in iso-osmotic buffer, the centrifugation step was
repeated, and the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer,
resulting in the light membrane fraction. All fractionation steps
were carried out at 4 °
C.
Caspase activity assay
Cells were seeded as mentioned in 96-well white-walled,
clear bottom plates. Treatment with staurosporine (10 �M)
served as positive control, and DMSO (10 �l) served as vehicle
control. Cells were treated with mensacarcin (0.5, 2, 10, or 50
�M), broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (10 �M),
or a combination of mensacarcin (0.5, 2, 10, or 50 �M) and
Z-VAD-FMK (10 �M) for 12 and 24 h. Caspase-3 and -7 activity
was measured using a luminescence-based Caspase- GloH 3/7
assay (Promega). The Caspase-GloH reagent, which also serves
to lyse the cells, was added directly to each well (50 �l) and
incubated for 1 h. The resulting luminescence was measured
using a Synergy HT microplate reader.
Fluorescence labeling of mensacarcin
For synthesis of the rhodamine-mensacarcin conjugate, 3 mg
of TMRCA and 4.5 mg of mensacarcin were dissolved in 800 �l
of dried DMSO and heated at 80 °
C for 1 h under nitrogen. The
reaction mixture was purified by preparative HPLC using an
Agilent 1100 HPLC equipped with a photodiode array detector
using a Phenomenex Kinetex C18, 5 �m � 150 mm � 4.6-mm
column. The mobile phase consisted of ultrapure water (solu-
tion A) and acetonitrile (solution B) using a gradient method
(0–2 min 5% B; 2–10 min 5–35% B; 10–28 min 35% B; 28–32
min 35–50% B; 32–45 min 50% B) with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min
at room temperature. Elution was monitored by UV-visible
detection at � � 330 nm (Amax mensacarcin) and � � 545 nm
(Amax TMR). Chromatograms revealed three major rhoda-
mine-mensacarcin conjugates (TMR-mensa) with retention
times between 25 and 30 min, respectively. All three TMR-
mensa conjugates were collected and subjected to mass spec-
trometric analysis. Low-resolution ESI-MS showed m/z values
of 848.3 for all three peaks indicate singly labeled mensacarcin
conjugates. HR-TOF-MS (ESI�) (C46H46N3O13) found m/z �
848.2986 [M � H]�, calculated m/z � 848.3025 [M � H]�, �
ppm � 4.6. LC-LRMS spectra were recorded on Agilent 1100
series LC with MSD 1946 and LC-HRMS spectra on Agilent
1200 series LC with 6230 TOF MS, respectively.
Subcellular co-localization studies
SK-Mel-5 cells were plated in glass bottom 24-well plates
(MatTek Corp.; Ashland, MA) and maintained overnight. Cells
were then incubated for 20 min at 37 °
C with the fluorescence
stains directly added to the culture medium (0.001% (w/v)
Hoechst, 1 �M TMR-mensa or TMRCA, and 1 �M ER-Tracker
or MitoGreen according to the manufacturer). Cells were care-
fully washed twice with PBS. Images were captured, and co-
localization was analyzed by inverted confocal fluorescence
microscopy (Zeiss LSM 780, Oberkochen, Germany) using
Zen 2 software (Hoechst: �ex � 405, detection 410–477 nm;
TMR-mensa/TMRCA: �ex � 561, detection 575–638 nm;
ER-Tracker: �ex � 488, detection 495–589 nm; MitoGreen:
�ex � 488, detection 491–562 nm). Cell fractionation was
used to verify accumulation of TMR-mensa in cell organ-
elles. Approximately 2 � 106 SK-Mel-5 cells were plated and
maintained overnight before treatment with 50 �M mensa
was started. After 6 h, cells were washed twice with PBS and
collected and fractionated following the protocol described
previously.

 Bioenergetic analysis and assessment of mitochondrial
function
OCR of living cells and ECAR measurements were per-
formed using the Seahorse XF24 extracellular flux analyzer
(Seahorse Bioscience, Billerica, MA) as described (28). The Sea-
horse XF24 extracellular flux analyzer makes continuous mea-
surements of oxygen concentration and proton flux over time.
These measurements of OCR and ECAR enable a direct quan-
tification of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. To assess
basal mitochondrial function and mitochondrial stress in
response to mensacarcin, cells were plated in XF24 cell culture
plates (HCT-116, 35,000 cells/well; SK-Mel-28, 15,000 cells/
well; SK-Mel-5, 20,000 cells/well) and maintained for 24 h at
37 °
C at 5% CO2. Before analysis, the culture medium was
replaced with unbuffered DMEM, pH 7.4. Cells were allowed to
equilibrate for 1 h at 37 °
C in a non-CO2 incubator immediately
before the XF assay. OCR and ECAR were measured under
basal conditions and after injection of various concentration of
mensacarcin. To assess key parameters of mitochondrial func-
tion, the drug injection ports of the XF24 assay cartridge were
loaded with mitochondrial toxins (final concentration in wells:
1 �M oligomycin, 0.5 �M FCCP, or 0.5 �M rotenone/antimycin
A), and the mensacarcin injection was followed by injection of
the mitochondria-perturbing reagents.
Data analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism
version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). The signif-
icance of observed differences was evaluated by one-way anal-
ysis of variance followed by Bonferroni multiple-comparison
post hoc test. The non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test fol-
lowed by Dunn’
s multiple-comparison post hoc test was used
for analysis of the comet assay results and the basal bioenerget-
ics analysis of cells. In all cases, p � 0.05 was considered to be
significant. Unless otherwise stated, all experimental values are
reported as mean � S.D.
Author contributions—B. P., E. N. K., and S. L. designed the study
and wrote the paper. B. P. performed most experiments and pre-
pared figures, and E. N. K. tested the caspase-dependent activity,
subcellular fractionation, and cytochrome c release (Figs. 4 and 5).
All authors analyzed the results and approved the final version of the
manuscript.
