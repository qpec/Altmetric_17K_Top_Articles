IMPORTANCE Low-income minority children living in urban neighborhoods are at high risk for
mental health problems and underachievement. ParentCorps, a family-centered,
school-based intervention in prekindergarten, improves parenting and school readiness
(ie, self-regulation and preacademic skills) in 2 randomized clinical trials. The longer-term
effect on child mental health and academic performance is not known.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether ParentCorps delivered as an enhancement to
prekindergarten programs in high-poverty urban schools leads to fewer mental health
problems and increased academic performance in the early elementary school years.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This is a 3-year follow-up study of a cluster randomized
clinical trial of ParentCorps in public schools with prekindergarten programs in New York City.
Ten elementary schools serving a primarily low-income, black student population were
randomized in 2005, and 4 consecutive cohorts of prekindergarten students were enrolled
from September 12, 2005, through December 31, 2008. We report follow-up for the 3
cohorts enrolled after the initial year of implementation. Data analysis was performed from
September 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS ParentCorps included professional development for prekindergarten and
kindergarten teachers and a program for parents and prekindergarten students (13 two-hour
group sessions delivered after school by teachers and mental health professionals).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Annual teacher ratings of mental health problems and
academic performance and standardized tests of academic achievement in kindergarten and
second grade by testers masked to the intervention or control group randomization.
RESULTS A total of 1050 children (4 years old; 518 boys [49.3%] and 532 girls [50.7%]) in 99
prekindergarten classrooms participated in the trial (88.1% of the prekindergarten
population), with 792 students enrolled from 2006 to 2008. Most families in the follow-up
study (421 [69.6%]) were low income; 680 (85.9%) identified as non-Latino black, 78 (9.8%)
as Latino, and 34 (4.3%) as other. Relative to their peers in prekindergarten programs,
children in ParentCorps-enhanced prekindergarten programs had lower levels of mental
health problems (Cohen d=0.44; 95% CI, 0.08-0.81) and higher teacher-rated academic
performance (Cohen d = 0.21; 95% CI, 0.02-0.39) in second grade.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Intervention in prekindergarten led to better mental health
and academic performance 3 years later. Family-centered early intervention has the potential
to prevent problems and reduce disparities for low-income minority children.

L
ow-income minority children living in urban neighbor-
hoods are at high risk for mental health problems and
academicunderachievement.1-4Compellingevidencein-
dicates that elimination of health disparities and the achieve-
ment gap requires meaningful engagement of families of chil-
dren in the earliest years. Children’
s brains are optimally
programmed to benefit from high-quality experiences dur-
ingearlychildhood.Accordingly,astrongearlyfoundationpro-
vides the greatest potential for healthy development across
domains.5
Substantial evidence indicates that nurturing relation-
ships and predictable interactions with parents and other care-
givers can buffer the effect of poverty-related stressors and ad-
verse childhood experiences. Experimental prevention trials
provide evidence in support of the causal role of parenting for
a broad range of child outcomes.6 ParentCorps is a family-
centered, school-based intervention that aims to help par-
ents and teachers create safe, nurturing, and predictable en-
vironments for young children. It is delivered as an
enhancement to prekindergarten (pre-K) in schools that serve
large numbers of low-income children. Intervention includes
professional development for pre-K and kindergarten teach-
ers and a program offered to all families of pre-K students,
implementedbymentalhealthprofessionalsandteachersdur-
ing after-school hours. Previous cluster randomized clinical
trials of ParentCorps found an effect on early childhood health
and development.7-10 Expected changes occurred in the home
and classroom environments based on parent and teacher re-
port and observations by masked raters.10,11 The second trial
evaluated the effect on kindergarten academic performance
(ie, achievement test scores and teacher ratings), with effects
observed across the full spectrum of baseline preacademic and
self-regulation skills.8 For children with low self-regulation,
additional intervention effects were detected on serious be-
havior problems at home (among boys),10 obesity,12 and health
behaviors.12
This article reports results from the second trial on chil-
dren’
s mental health problems during a 3-year period. This
study also evaluates whether the effect on kindergarten aca-
demic performance is maintained through second grade. We
considered whether baseline self-regulation moderates inter-
vention effects on mental health and academic performance.
We hypothesized that relative to pre-K only, ParentCorps-
enhanced pre-K would result in lower levels of mental health
problems and higher academic performance. On the basis of
previous findings, we expected that effects would be compa-
rable or greater for children with low self-regulation and that
family participation (ie, dose) would be associated with bet-
ter outcomes.
Methods
Participants
Children entered pre-K and were enrolled in the trial at 4 years
of age; this study followed up children at 5, 6, 7, and 8 years
of age. The trial aimed to enroll all pre-K students in 4 con-
secutive years (September 12, 2005, through December 31,
2008); the only inclusion criterion was having an English-
speaking caregiver (88 of 1280 children [6.9%] were ineli-
gible).Themajorfeaturesofthedesignwerereportedearlier8,10

at least 1 year of capacity building for high-quality
implementation,8,13thisstudyexaminesoutcomesamongchil-
dren who were enrolled in pre-K after the first year of profes-
sional development and program implementation. All data

cation.Thestudywasintroducedatpre-Korientation,andpar-
ents provided written informed consent. Data analysis for the
follow-up study was performed from September 1, 2014, to De-
cember 31, 2015.
School Selection and Randomization
A cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted in 2 school
districtsinNewYorkCity.Schoolswererequiredtohaveapre-K
program with at least 2 classrooms (36 children) and a stu-
dent population that was more than 80% black and more than
70% low income (ie, eligible for free lunch). Principals from
the first 10 schools approached for the study agreed to par-
ticipate; the trial schools are representative of all schools in the
2 districts (N = 34) with respect to demographics and state
achievementtestscores.8Toensureapproximatelyequalnum-
bers of children in the 2 conditions, before randomization,
schools were matched on size and split into pairs; within each
pair, one school was randomized to the intervention group and
the other to the control group. All 10 schools remained ran-
domized to their groups throughout the study.
Intervention Conditions

olds and full-day kindergarten. In the intervention condition,

pre-K and kindergarten teachers, mental health profession-
als, and paraprofessionals and (2) programs for parents and
pre-K students led by mental health professionals and teach-
ers. The intervention aimed to help parents and teachers cre-
ate safe, nurturing, and predictable environments at home and
at school through the use of a specific set of evidence-based
strategies, which in turn support children’
s self-regulation
skills. These foundational skills, along with continued use of
evidence-based strategies by caregivers, are expected to pro-
mote mental health and school success.
Professional development included large-group experi-
ential training (5 days in the first year; 2-3 days in subsequent
years) and individual consultation (approximately 6 hours per
year); pre-K teachers who chose to lead the program for stu-
dents received additional training (2 days per year), coaching
(1 hour per week for 13 weeks), and compensation for after-
hours work.10
All families of pre-K students were invited to participate
in 13 weekly 2-hour sessions for parents (Parenting Program;
approximately 15 members) and concurrent sessions for chil-
dren (Friends School) that were held at school, typically from
5 to 7 PM. During the Parenting Program, mental health pro-
fessionals presented a specific set of strategies (eg, goal set-
ting, attention during child-directed play, and helping chil-
drenregulateemotions).Facilitatorsusedarangeoftechniques
(eg, role-play, discussion about video clips) to encourage par-
ticipation, reflection, and consideration of cultural and con-
textual influences on parenting and child development. In
Friends School, pre-K teachers used a consistent structure (eg,
lessons, child-directed play) and a parallel set of strategies to
promote self-regulation skills (eg, paying attention, identify-
ing feelings).
Implementation of Intervention
All procedures were specified in manuals, and multimethod
assessments indicated that fidelity was high (after capacity
building, adherence was ≥90%10). Most families (257 of 423
[60.8%]) participated and, among participants, mean atten-
dance was 7.30 of 13. The Parenting Program was engaging to
parents from diverse backgrounds and those in greatest need
of services as indicated by the lack of significant associations
between participation and a broad range of baseline
characteristics.10
Assessments and Definitions of Variables
Outcomes were teacher ratings of mental health problems and
academic performance and achievement test scores. Teacher
ratingsofmentalhealthwereobtainedonexternalizing(ie,con-
duct problems, aggression, and hyperactivity) and internaliz-
ing (ie, anxiety, depression, and somatization) scales of the Be-
havior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition.14
Ratings were made at baseline and at the end of each year in
pre-K through second grade (5 times with 4 teachers). Exter-
nalizing and internalizing scores were standardized based on
age and sex and averaged to form an overall composite of men-
tal health. Teachers also rated academic performance
annually.8,15 Reading and math achievement were assessed
twice—at the end of kindergarten and second grade—with the
Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement (KTEA) Brief Form,
Second Edition, by testers masked to condition.16 The Speed
Developmental Indicators for the Assessment of Learning
(DIAL) was administered in pre-K to provide a baseline indi-
cator of preacademic skills.17 Self-regulation was assessed via
masked observations during DIAL.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses assessed intervention-control differences on child-
level outcomes and were based on the intention-to-treat prin-
ciple (ie, all cases randomized at baseline were included in the
analyses; multiple imputation was used to account for cases
with missing data at follow-up). Effects were estimated with
linear mixed-effects models using all available data.18 Post-
intervention scores were modeled as a function of interven-
tion, time, and the intervention × time interaction. Four post-
intervention time points were available and analyzed for
teacher-rated mental health problems and academic perfor-
mance; 2 postintervention time points were available and ana-
lyzed for achievement tests. The intervention × time interac-
tion was included in the model to assess whether change over
time was different in the 2 conditions or conversely whether
the magnitude of intervention-control difference varied with
time. All analyses adjusted for the corresponding baseline in-
dicator and cohort. The model accounted for between-
subject (within school) correlation by including school-level
randominterceptsandslopesfortimeandwithin-subject(over
time) correlation by including autocorrelated residual error
terms. Statistical inference was based on 95% CIs; P values are
reported only for interaction terms. Intervention effect sizes
were interpreted by computing the Cohen d using model-
based estimates of the parameters of interest (eg, interven-
tion and control means) and SDs based on published norms or
the mean across the 2 conditions at baseline.
To assess whether the intervention effect was the same
across levels of baseline self-regulation, the model above was
expanded to include the moderator (ie, self-regulation), mod-
erator × intervention, moderator × time, and modera-
tor × time × interventioninteractions.Asinpreviousreports,7,8
we considered children to have received full vs partial dose if
parents participated in 5 or more sessions; 152 of 423 children
(35.9%) received the full dose, and these families attended a
mean of 10 sessions.10 We modeled postintervention out-
comes as a function of dose (0, partial; 1, full; 2, control), time,
and dose × time, adjusting for baseline and cohort as above.
A total of 409 of 792 children (51.6%) had complete data
for all measures and times; 768 (97.0%) had baseline and at
least 1 follow-up teacher rating, and 615 (77.7%) had at least 1
follow-up KTEA score. Teacher ratings were missing for 16
(2.0%), 111 (14.0%), 270 (34.1%), and 334 (42.2%) cases at fol-
low-up from pre-K through second grade, respectively; the
KTEA score was missing for 169 children (21.3%) in kindergar-
ten and 348 (43.9%) in second grade. We used multiple impu-
tations, assuming data were missing at random.19 The impu-
tation made use of the joint distribution of all outcomes and
thefollowingdemographicandbaselinefactors:cohort,school,
sex, age, neighborhood poverty, DIAL screener, observed self-
regulation, and teacher-rated adaptive behaviors. These

factors were chosen because they are often associated with
mental health, academic performance, and missingness. Using
Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, we minimally im-
puted the sample to achieve monotone missingness. We then
sequentially imputed data for each wave using the predictive
mean matching method separately for the intervention and
control groups to account for the possibility of different miss-
ing data patterns by condition.20-22 Ten data sets were im-
puted. SAS statistical software (SAS Institute Inc) was used to
perform the analysis.23
Results
Baseline Characteristics, Intervention Equivalence,
and Participant Flow
The trial included 1050 children, representing 88.1% of eli-
gible pre-K students, enrolled as 4 consecutive cohorts (518
boys[49.3%]and532girls[50.7%]in99pre-Kclassrooms).This
follow-up study examines outcomes for the 3 cohorts that en-
rolled after the initial year of implementation (792 of 1050 chil-
dren in the trial). Most families (421 [69.6%]) were low in-
come; 680 (85.9%) identified as non-Latino black, 78 (9.8%)
as Latino, and 34 (4.3%) as other. No differences were found
between the conditions on any child or family demographic
characteristic. Baseline testing of preacademic skills and
masked observations of self-regulation were also compa-
rable across condition; baseline differences were found in
teacher ratings of mental health and performance (Table 1).
The Figure shows the flow of the participants in the trial.
Of the 792 students in this follow-up study, 78 (9.8%) were un-
available for follow-up (retention: 377 [89.1%] in the interven-
tion group and 337 [91.3%] in the control group); 485 (61.2%)
remained in study schools and had complete outcome data
through second grade (254 [60.0%] in the intervention group
and 231 [62.6%] in the control group). Children with data in
second grade did not differ from those without data on demo-
graphiccharacteristics,baselineteacherratings,orschoolreadi-
ness (P > .05).
Mental Health Problems
The intervention × time interactions were significant, indi-
cating that the magnitude of the effect on mental health in-
creased over time (P = .003) (Table 2). From 5 to 8 years of age,
problemsincreasedsubstantiallyforchildrenincontrolschools
(5.64 points [or 0.56 SD] on a norm-referenced scale); in con-
trast, among intervention school children, problems re-
mained relatively stable (decreased 0.99 points [−0.10 SD]).
These diverging trajectories resulted in children in control
schools having higher levels of mental health problems than
those in intervention schools at 8 years of age (d = 0.44; 95%
CI, 0.08-0.81). Post hoc examination of the 2 measures in the

mental health composite revealed similar patterns, with sub-
stantial differences at 8 years of age on each domain (behav-
ioral d = 0.36; emotional d = 0.42). The investigation of
whether baseline self-regulation moderated the intervention
effect revealed no evidence of moderation (interven-
tion × time × self-regulation interaction: estimated=−0.36;
95% CI, −1.18 to 0.46; P = .38; intervention × self-regulation:
estimated=−2.27; 95% CI, −7.66 to 3.12; P = .40). Overall, there
was no dose-response relationship. However, among the sub-
group of high-risk children (ie, low self-regulation), there was
a 2-fold difference in the effect on mental health for children
exposed to full dose vs partial dose (d = 0.81 vs 0.40).
Academic Performance
The intervention effect was significant, whereas the inter-
vention × time interaction was not, suggesting that the mag-
nitude of the effect on teacher-rated academic performance
was maintained over time (P = .17) (Table 2). Although perfor-
mance decreased in both conditions from 5 to 8 years of age,
children in intervention schools performed higher than con-
trols consistently over time (d=0.21; 95% CI, 0.02-0.39).
Similarly, for achievement tests, the intervention × time
interaction was not significant (reading: estimated = −4.18;
95% CI, −10.30 to 1.95; P = .18; math: estimated = −2.44; 95%
CI, −6.02 to 1.14; P = .18), suggesting that the effect on kin-
dergarten achievement reported previously8 did not deterio-
rate substantially by second grade. On the basis of a reduced
model (excluding the nonsignificant interaction term), read-
ing test scores were marginally higher for children in inter-
vention schools relative to controls (d = 0.32; 95% CI, −0.06
to 0.70); there was no discernible benefit for math achieve-
ment (d = 0.10; 95% CI, −0.03 to 0.23). There were no signifi-
cant 2-way or 3-way interaction effects for any outcome
(P > .10). For all 3 academic outcomes, the intervention effect
was 1.5 to 3 times greater for children with full vs partial dose
(performance: d = 0.26 vs 0.17; reading: d = 0.46 vs 0.24;
math: d = 0.18 vs 0.06).
Discussion
This follow-up study examined intervention-control differ-
ences on mental health and academic performance through 8
years of age. In early childhood, intervention improved aca-
demic performance (teacher ratings and achievement tests) for
all children and behavior problems among the highest-risk
boys.8,10 At the 3-year follow-up, an effect was detectable for
mental health (behavioral and emotional problems) and aca-
demic performance across baseline levels of risk (child self-
regulation). For children enrolled in pre-K in control schools,
mental health problems observable by teachers increased sub-
stantially(morethanone-halfSD)duringtheearlyschoolyears.
This pattern is consistent with the well-described accumula-
tion of stressors and cascading negative consequences for
health and development among children living in poverty.5 In
sharp contrast, children in pre-K programs with ParentCorps
had no increase in mental health problems over time. These
different trajectories resulted in clinically meaningful differ-
ences by second grade (eg, controls were nearly twice as likely
as children in intervention schools to score in the clinical range
on a norm-referenced teacher rating scale). Of importance, be-
cause ParentCorps was delivered as an enhancement to pre-K,
effects are over and above the benefits of pre-K (estimated to
be one-third SD if high quality).24,25 Finally, the intervention
effect can be compared with well-established gaps in out-
comes for low-income minority children. For example, the
effect of ParentCorps on academic performance is approxi-
mately half that of the black-white achievement gap (one-
half SD).26,27
The intervention-control differences on mental health and
academic performance remained across baseline levels of self-
regulation observed during pre-K. In high-poverty urban
schools, an estimated one-quarter of children enter school
without adequate self-regulation.10,28,29 Although self-
regulation facilitates on-task behavior and optimal manage-
ment of attention, motivation, and stress reactivity while
learning,30-32childrenwithouttheseskillsaremuchmorelikely
to have negative interactions with teachers and peers and ul-
timately to develop emotional or behavioral problems that in-
terfere with learning.33,34 ParentCorps’focus on helping teach-
ers and parents create safe, nurturing, and predictable
environments is expected to soothe children’
s physiologic
stress response and allow for the acquisition of executive func-
tioning skills.32 Although this study did not directly measure
stress response, the plausibility of this mechanism is sup-
ported by the prior demonstration by Brotman et al35,36 that
family-centered early intervention with low-income black and
Latino families altered cortisol levels and prosocial and dis-
ruptive peer interactions.

a Four postintervention time points were included: spring of prekindergarten
(time = −3), spring of kindergarten (time = −2), spring of first grade (time = −1),
and spring of second grade (time = 0). All analyses controlled for cohort (ie,
year of implementation). The estimate for intervention reflects the
intervention-control difference in mean outcome in the spring of second grade
(adjusting for baseline). The estimate for the intervention × time interaction
indicates whether the magnitude of the intervention-control difference varies
with time or, conversely, whether the change over time is different for the
intervention vs control conditions.

Developmental theory provides a rationale for the expec-
tation that a relatively brief intervention in early childhood
could result in meaningful and sustained benefits for mental
health and academic domains, especially among those at high-
est risk for problems.37,38 First, although no single factor pre-
dicting later outcomes has a large effect size, the accumula-
tion of small effects over time can be great. Therefore, small
increases in self-regulation and early learning can lead to large
differences in mental health and academic performance. Sec-
ond, there is a primacy of early influences such that they trig-
ger cascades that become larger effects over time. Third, the
development of mental health and school success is charac-
terized by transactional influences across several domains.
Therefore, by altering parent and teacher behaviors, self-
regulation, and early learning, intervention yields broad and
long-lasting effects.
Several limitations of the study deserve consideration.
First, the trial included a relatively small number of schools,
which decreases power (effective number of participants is de-
creased because of clustering within a school). Second, al-
though there was no evidence that children who left study
schools were different from those who remained, they may
have differed on unmeasured characteristics. Third, despite
randomization, the conditions differed with respect to base-
line teacher ratings, which makes comparison between con-
ditionsmoredifficult.Wenotethatalternativeanalyses(mixed-
effects models applied to baseline score as an outcome rather
than including baseline as a covariate) resulted in highly simi-
larinferencesaboutintervention-controldifferencesovertime.
Fourth, it is possible that teacher ratings were biased. Inter-
vention may have sensitized teachers such that they per-
ceived children differently than their colleagues in control
schools. However, second grade teachers were not involved in
the intervention and were unaware of families’level of par-
ticipation during pre-K, and the intervention-control differ-
ence in academic performance (as rated by pre-K through sec-
ond grade) was consistent with the favorable pattern observed
for the objective reading achievement tests (kindergarten and
second grade). Fifth, although careful examination of family
participation revealed that a broad range of factors was not as-
sociatedwithdose(eg,parentaldepression,ethnicity,andchild
school readiness),10 unmeasured characteristics may be.
As ParentCorps is implemented independently by school
districts in New York City and other urban centers, it will be
important to determine whether it can be implemented with
fidelity and whether effects on mental health and academic
performance are replicated for diverse populations. Further
study of mechanisms underlying change will be critical to ad-
vance developmental and intervention theory and for con-
tinuous program improvements.
Conclusions
Children in schools with ParentCorps had more positive tra-
jectories for mental health and academic performance. Find-
