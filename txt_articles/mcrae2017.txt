improved function, education and prevention: a survey

Introduction
In some, but not all, countries, physiotherapists work as
primary care health practitioners. In Australia, over 40% of the
approximately 26 000 registered physiotherapists work in a
primary care private practice setting.1,2 Their primary care role
includes different aspects of care such as making a diagnosis,
providing information and education, treating pain and/or poor
function, and implementing prevention strategies.3
While physiotherapists work in primary care, and in many
countries their training is directed at providing the broad skills
needed for this role, it is unclear how patients perceive the role of
physiotherapists working in primary care. It may be that patients
see physiotherapists as primary care clinicians, like general
practitioners, who can provide a range of services – including
diagnosis, advice, education, treatment and prevention – or they
may primarily see physiotherapists as practitioners who provide
physical treatments for pain. Physiotherapists working in primary
care are well trained to help health systems cope with the
enormous and growing burden of musculoskeletal conditions.
Their training in assessment and treatment of musculoskeletal
conditions typically exceeds that of medical practitioners, yet this
is potentially wasted if those presenting to physiotherapists see
them only as clinicians to treat pain, rather than well-trained
primary care practitioners with knowledge and skills to diagnose
and manage musculoskeletal conditions.
In many countries, including Australia, governments appear to
acknowledge physiotherapists’ primary care skills by granting
primary contact status; however, they do not rebate the costs for a
patient who chooses to see a primary care physiotherapist rather
than a general practitioner. If physiotherapists are to lobby
government and other funders to rebate physiotherapy services
in primary care they need evidence that patients perceive them as
having all the skills necessary to provide high-quality primary care
management of musculoskeletal conditions.
We have been able to identify almost no research that has been
conducted on patients’ reasons for presenting to primary care
physiotherapists. 
Privately commissioned 
studies 
have 
been
conducted by bodies representing physiotherapy in Australia;4
however, this information is not published or widely available.

Questions: How important are different aspects of physiotherapy care to patients presenting to a primary
care physiotherapist? Are patient factors (eg, age and gender) associated with how important different
aspects of physiotherapy care are to individual patients? Design: A cross-sectional survey with
consecutive recruitment. Participants: A total of 500 adults aged � 18 years who presented to a primary
care physiotherapist. Methods: Participants were recruited from 10 private practices within the Sydney
metropolitan area. Participants completed a survey assessing how important five aspects of
physiotherapy care were in their initial decision to present to a primary care physiotherapist. These
aspects were: diagnosis; information and education; treatment for pain relief; treatment to improve function;
and prevention. The survey also collected characteristics of the patients and information about their
presentation to the physiotherapist, to assess whether these factors were associated with the aspects of
physiotherapy care that they considered most important. Results: A total of 500 surveys were completed,
with a response rate of 94%. All five aspects of physiotherapy care were considered either ‘quite
important’ or ‘extremely important’ by most participants (diagnosis 65%; information and education 68%;
pain relief 89%; improved function 93%; prevention 90%). Patient factors were associated with the
participants’ ratings of importance. Female participants and those with spinal pain more commonly
rated pain relief as highly important. Participants with lower educational levels were more likely to rate
diagnosis and information and education as important. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that most
patients presenting to primary care physiotherapists value all aspects of physiotherapy care and do not
simply want treatment for pain. Patient characteristics were associated with what individual patients
considered the most important reason for presenting to a private primary care physiotherapist. [McRae

 primary care clinicians who provide a range of services, including
diagnosis, information, education and prevention. This informa-
tion is important to clinicians as well as educators and professional
bodies advocating for physiotherapy. If patients consider a range of
physiotherapy services, including diagnosis, advice and reassur-
ance, as important reasons to attend physiotherapists, then it is
important that physiotherapists themselves value these services
and do not focus only on treating pain, when this is not the primary
or sole reason that a person presents for care. Evidence on why
people present to a primary care physiotherapist can also be used
by professional bodies to advocate for physiotherapists as primary
care practitioners and to push for rebate for patients with
musculoskeletal conditions who choose to present to physiothera-
pists instead of general practitioners.
Therefore, the research questions for this cross-sectional survey
were:
1. How important are different aspects of physiotherapy care
(diagnosis, information and education, treatment for pain relief,
treatment to improve function, and prevention) to patients
presenting to a primary care physiotherapist?
2. Are patient factors (eg, age and gender) associated with how
important different aspects of physiotherapy care are to
individual patients?
Method
Design
This study was a cross-sectional survey of consecutively
sampled, adult patients presenting to primary care physiothera-
pists. Patients were invited to complete the survey either before or
immediately after their appointment.
Participants, therapists, and centres
Participants were recruited from 10 physiotherapy practices
that were purposely selected to achieve varied geographic and
socioeconomic characteristics in the Sydney metropolitan area.
Socioeconomic indexes were referenced to the Australian Bureau
of Statistics’ Socio-Economic Indexes For Areas (SEIFA) advantage/
disadvantage index.5
Participants were adults aged � 18 years, who were consecu-
tively sampled when presenting to the recruiting physiotherapy
practices. No other eligibility criteria were used. Consecutive
patients were recruited at each site until 50 completed surveys
were obtained. Data collection was completed over multiple
practice sessions or days, as required, depending on the number of
patients attending the clinic.
Consecutive patients were invited to participate in the survey
by the practice secretary, who briefly informed them about the
study and requirements. If a patient agreed to participate, they
completed an appropriate consent form and a non-identifiable
hardcopy survey while waiting for, or immediately after, their
appointment. A researcher immediately reviewed completed
surveys to ensure no missing data. If patients preferred, they
were given the option of a take-home survey pack to complete
away from the clinic and return either by mailed hardcopy or
online. The number of patients who chose not to participate was
recorded and was used in conjunction with the completed survey
numbers to calculate the response rate. The stated reason for not
participating was also recorded.
Outcome measures
No existing survey met the needs of the study, so a 12-item
survey was designed; it was piloted with physiotherapists and
patients prior to implementation within this study. Existing
literature on survey design was used to guide the survey
development.6–11
To investigate how important different aspects of physiothera-
py care (diagnosis, information and education, treatment for pain
relief, treatment to improve function, and prevention) were to
patients presenting to a primary care physiotherapist, we asked the
following question using a 5-point Likert scale: ‘Please indicate
how important the following reasons were in your initial decision
to present to a physiotherapist for your current health condition’.
An open-ended question was included in the survey prior to the
Likert scales, to ask for participants’ main reason for presenting to
the physiotherapist. This was used to identify any other aspects of
physiotherapy care that were important to patients but not
covered in the five predetermined questions.
The survey also collected information on demographics and
patient factors that could influence what aspects of physiotherapy
care individual participants considered to be the most impor-
tant.10,12,13 The factors that were investigated are listed in Table 1.
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the participants’
demographic and other presenting characteristics. To evaluate
how important patients considered each of the five aspects of care,
we calculated the median (IQR) score on the 5-point Likert rating
scale for each aspect of care. The frequency values were also
plotted to assess the spread of importance ratings across the five
aspects of care. Finally, for each aspect of care, we calculated the
proportion of participants who scored that aspect highest or equal
highest on the Likert scales.
Multivariate logistic regression models were performed to
evaluate if each of the 10 patient factors were associated with
different responses to each of the five questions about how
important different aspects of care were. We dichotomised
responses on the 5-point Likert scale by pooling ‘quite important’
or ‘extremely important’ into ‘highly important’ and the other three
responses into ‘not important’.
The responses to open-ended questions were reviewed to
identify other aspects of physiotherapy treatment that may not
have been considered for the five Likert scale items. Any new
presenting reason categories were noted during data entry and
were reviewed by the researchers.

 three from a middle socioeconomic area, and four from high
socioeconomic areas.
In total, 500 of the 533 approached patients participated in the
survey, giving a response rate of 94%. The reasons for non-
participation and the completeness of the data are presented in the
flow diagram (Figure 1). All participants chose to complete the
survey while at the clinic rather than later at home. The
participants’ characteristics are shown in Table 1.
The qualitative question did not identify any reasons beyond
those outlined in the five specified aspects of physiotherapy
treatment. Several participants responded that being referred by a
medical practitioner or having a previous health condition
managed by the current or a previous physiotherapist was listed
as a reason for presenting. These responses were not considered as
new categories, because they were not aspects of physiotherapy
treatment.

the importance of the five aspects of physiotherapy treatment can

 5 (IQR 4 to 5), whereas for diagnosis and information and education
the median was 4 (IQR 3 to 5). Most patients rated each of the five
aspects of care as either ‘quite important’ or ‘extremely important’:
pain 
relief 
(89%), 
improved 
function 
(93%), 
diagnosis 
(65%),
information and education (68%), and prevention (90%). The aspects
of care rated highest or equal highest in importance by most
participants were pain relief (73%), improved function (77%), and
prevention (71%). Less commonly, participants rated diagnosis (41%)
or information and education (38%) as the highest or equal highest
in importance. Note that the percentage values do not sum to 100%,
due to multiple aspects being rated equally important by some
participants.
Factors associated with reasons for presentation
The association between patient factors and their ratings on the
dichotomised importance ratings for the five aspects of care are
shown in Figures 3 to 7. Participants were more likely to consider
pain relief important if they were female (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.15 to
3.73) or presented with a spinal condition (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.42 to
5.25). No investigated variables were associated with how
improved function was rated. Diagnosis was more likely to be rated
as important by participants who had not completed university
education (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.03). Participants were more
likely to rate information and education as important if they had

importance rating of prevention strategies was not influenced by
any investigated factors.
Discussion
This study demonstrated that patients present to private
primary care physiotherapists for a variety of reasons, all of which
they generally rate as important. Most participants considered all
five of the aspects of physiotherapy treatment as highly important
(ie, quite important or extremely important) reasons to present to
a private primary care physiotherapist: pain relief (89%), improved
function (93%), diagnosis (65%), information and education (68%),
and prevention (90%). Pain relief (73%), improved function (77%), and
prevention (71%) were commonly rated as the highest or equal
highest in importance as reasons for attending the physiotherapy
practice. Less commonly, participants rated diagnosis (41%) or
information and education (38%) as the highest or equal highest in
importance.
This study also demonstrated that some patient factors
influenced the participants’ rating of importance with respect to

 pain relief, diagnosis, and information and education. Females and
those with spinal pain more commonly rated pain relief as
important. Participants with lower educational levels were more
likely to rate diagnosis and information and education as important,
compared with those with higher educational levels.
The study included a large sample of patients from a range of
socioeconomic regions across Sydney, to ensure a representative
sample of the target population. Patients were approached to
participate in this study on a consecutive basis to help reduce
participation bias. All refusals to participate were recorded.
Response rates were very high, with no missing data from patients
who agreed to be involved. The qualitative item in the survey
(asking 
for 
the 
reason why 
participants 
presented 
to 
the
physiotherapist, in their own words) did not identify any other
broad 
aspect 
of 
physiotherapy 
treatment 
beyond 
the 
five
prespecified reasons, suggesting that these aspects of care covered
a comprehensive range of reasons for presenting for care. The
responses to the open-ended question that did not align closely
with the five aspects of care were mostly patients listing their self-
diagnosis (eg, ‘my knee pain’ or ‘ankle sprain’) or mechanism of
injury (eg, ‘I twisted my knee and fell’).
All attempts were made to develop a valid and reliable survey
with several previously used items.10,12,13 However, there was no
existing survey that was appropriate for the study’s purpose, so the
survey that was used had not undergone testing of clinimetric
properties. Participants completed the survey either on their first
or return visit, either before or after seeing the physiotherapist. It is
possible that this may have influenced the findings, but it was done
to optimise response rate. Participants’ ratings of importance with
respect to the five aspects of care were not associated with
whether participants completed the survey on their first or return
visit, or before or after seeing the physiotherapist. However, there
was a non-significant trend to higher ratings of importance for
diagnosis, information and education, treatment to improve function,
and prevention in participants who completed the survey after
seeing the physiotherapist. This trend may be explained by
participants becoming aware of these aspects of care during the
visit with the physiotherapist.
When investigating if patient factors were predictors of
different responses to each of the five questions, we dichotomised
responses on the 5-point Likert scale by pooling ‘quite important’
or ‘extremely important’ into ‘highly important’ and the other three
responses into ‘not important’. The results may have been different
if an alternative threshold was used for dichotomising this
outcome.
To our knowledge, this is the first study that has directly asked
patients what is important to them when presenting to primary
care physiotherapists. Hush and colleagues performed a study14
that 
investigated patients’ 
satisfaction with musculoskeletal
physiotherapy care and the factors that influenced this degree of
satisfaction. It is difficult to make direct comparisons with the
present study because the study question was quite different;
nevertheless, the findings were similar in that patients placed a
high level of importance on aspects of care that were not directly
related to improvements in their presenting health condition (eg,
attributes of the therapist in the Hush study and process of care in
both studies).
It is critical for the physiotherapy profession to understand how
their patients perceive the profession and what they expect when
presenting for care. This study provides insight into the aspects of
care that patients presenting to primary care physiotherapists in
Australia consider important. It appears that those presenting for
care view physiotherapists as health professionals who can provide
diagnosis, education, information, and prevention strategies, as
well as treatment for pain and disability. The study does not
provide 
any 
data 
on 
broad 
community 
perceptions 
about
physiotherapists and it is possible that the general community
perception of physiotherapists is different. Many people with
musculoskeletal conditions continue to see their general practi-
tioner as the first point of contact with the health system. It is
important for future research to investigate why this is the case,
given that physiotherapists have substantially more training in
assessing and managing musculoskeletal conditions. The current
study suggests that at least those people presenting to phy-
siotherapists consider physiotherapists to have a wide range of
primary care skills, so it is possible that other factors, such as the
additional cost associated with presenting to physiotherapists
compared with general practitioners, are important drivers for
many people continuing to see general practitioners first when
they have musculoskeletal conditions. The present study found
that fewer participants rated diagnosis or information and education
as highly important reasons to present to a primary care
physiotherapist. It is possible that some patients still consider
these aspects of care as primarily a general practitioner’s role, and

 therefore primary care physiotherapists need to do more to
promote their skills and ability in these areas.
While the findings of this study generally support the role of
physiotherapists as primary care practitioners, they also raise some
challenges for the profession. Much recent evidence suggests that
many people with musculoskeletal conditions presenting to
primary care need minimal care focusing on high-quality advice,
reassurance and self-management, after serious causes have been
eliminated.15–17 For physiotherapists to be viewed as the primary
care clinicians of choice for musculoskeletal conditions, it is
essential that they fully embrace this important role and do not
provide excessive treatment. However, private practice phy-
siotherapists should strongly consider a greater focus on preven-
tion, based on the findings that the majority of patients presenting
for care rate prevention as highly important, and recent evidence
suggests that prevention programs for conditions like back pain are
effective.18 The findings of the current study support the argument
for physiotherapists to lobby government and other funders to
cover primary care physiotherapy; however, there is a need to
demonstrate that this will not result in increased costs.
The current study demonstrates that while patients generally
value all aspects of physiotherapy care, certain aspects of care are
more important to individual patients. It is important for
physiotherapists to ascertain what is most important for each
person presenting for care, and to ensure alignment between the
patient’s and physiotherapist’s expectations and goals.19 Our
findings suggest some general patterns that physiotherapists
should be aware of. Patients with lower educational levels were
more likely to rate diagnosis and information and education as
important. Patients presenting with a spinal condition or who
were female placed a higher level of importance on treatment for
pain relief. Improved function was the aspect of care that was rated
highest on average, and no particular patient characteristics were
associated with this, probably at least in part due to the fact that it
was considered important by almost all patients. The importance
of improved function may be common to similar patients
presenting to other health professionals (eg, general practitioners
or chiropractors) with similar conditions, or it may be a feature that
patients 
specifically 
associate 
with 
physiotherapists. 
Future
research should investigate any differences in what patients’
expectations are of physiotherapists compared with other health
professionals, when presenting with musculoskeletal conditions
that are seen by a number of different primary care clinicians.
In conclusion, physiotherapists working in primary care should
be confident that the majority of patients presenting for care
consider physiotherapists to be health professionals who can
provide diagnosis, education, information, and prevention strate-
gies, as well as treatment for pain and/or disability. Physiothera-
pists should therefore confidently take on the important role of
primary care clinicians and not simply focus on managing pain.
Given the importance that most patients place on prevention, this
is an aspect of care that physiotherapists should strongly consider
and discuss with patients. Those who advocate for physiothera-
pists should lobby government and other funders to cover the costs
of patients with musculoskeletal conditions who choose to seek
primary care management from a physiotherapist rather than a
general practitioner.
What is already known on this topic: Physiotherapists in
primary care can offer diagnosis, information, education,
treatment of pain, treatment of poor function, and prevention
strategies. Little research has investigated how patients
perceive these aspects of the role of physiotherapists working
in primary care.
What this study adds: Patients presenting to primary care
physiotherapists generally rated all aspects of care that
physiotherapists can offer as important. Pain relief was more
commonly rated as highly important by female patients and
those with spinal pain. Patients with lower educational levels
were more likely to rate diagnosis and information/education
as important.
