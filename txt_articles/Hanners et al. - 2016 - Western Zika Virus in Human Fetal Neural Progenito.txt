In Brief
Hanners et al. establish a cell-culture
model of a 2015 ZIKV isolate in primary
human fetal neural progenitors. They
show that ZIKV infection kills a subset of
fetal neural progenitors with limited
activation of inflammatory or immune
responses. In the surviving neural
progenitors, ZIKV replication persists for
many weeks, mirroring fetal
neuropathological findings in vivo.

SUMMARY
The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in the Western
hemisphere is associated with severe pathology in
newborns, including microcephaly and brain damage.
The mechanisms underlying these outcomes are un-
der intense investigation. Here, we show that a 2015
ZIKV isolate replicates in multiple cell types, including
primary human fetal neural progenitors (hNPs). In
immortalized cells, ZIKV is cytopathic and grossly re-
arranges endoplasmic reticulum membranes similar
to other flaviviruses. In hNPs, ZIKV infection has a
partial cytopathic phase characterized by cell round-
ing, pyknosis, and activation of caspase 3. Despite
notable cell death, ZIKV did not activate a cytokine
response in hNPs. This lack of cell intrinsic immunity
to ZIKV is consistent with our observation that
virus replication persists in hNPs for at least 28 days.
These findings, supported by published fetal neuro-
pathology, establish a proof-of-concept that neural
progenitors in the developing human fetus can be
direct targets of detrimental ZIKV-induced pathology.
INTRODUCTION
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus in
the Flaviviridae family. In 2015, the detection of circulating ZIKV
in Brazil later coincided with an alarming increase in the number
of babies born with microcephaly (Kindhauser et al., 2016; Schu-
ler-Faccini et al., 2016). Accumulating evidence has now been
deemed sufficiently strong to establish a causal relationship be-
tween maternal ZIKV infection and microcephaly and other fetal
brain anomalies (Rasmussen et al., 2016). In adults, 93% of pa-
tients diagnosed with Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome during the French
Polynesia outbreak of 2013 were positive for ZIKV IgM (Cao-Lor-
meau et al., 2016). These findings indicate that contemporary
ZIKV is highly neurovirulent, with particularly devastating conse-
quences in fetuses.
Cell cultures and animal models have begun to reveal mecha-
nisms of ZIKV-induced pathology. Recent studies have reported
that ZIKV infects stem-cell-derived human neural progenitors
(hNPs), neurospheres, and organoids with growth-attenuating
effects (Cugola et al., 2016; Dang et al., 2016; Garcez et al.,
2016; Qian et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016). African and Asian
ZIKV infections do not infect full-term primary human placental
trophoblasts due to type III interferon-mediated viral restriction
(Bayer et al., 2016). In mouse models, some of which are immu-
nocompromised, ZIKV infections recapitulate multiple features
of disease in humans, including trans-placental fetal transmis-
sion and severe neuropathology in both the adult and fetal brain
(Cugola et al., 2016; Lazear et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; Miner
et al., 2016; Rossi et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016). Comparative viral
sequence analyses revealed that multiple amino-acid changes
have arisen over the past half century as the virus has migrated
out of Africa (Wang et al., 2016). Several mutations are predicted
to cause significant changes in protein structure, underscoring
the importance of studying ZIKV isolates from the current
outbreak.
Here, we use immortalized cell cultures and fetal-derived
hNPs to characterize a contemporary ZIKV isolate from the cur-
rent outbreak in the Western hemisphere. We show that ZIKV is
acutely cytopathic in neural progenitors but establishes a persis-
tent infection that is consistent with clinical pathology findings
(Driggers et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016; Rasmussen et al.,
2016). We also demonstrate that neural progenitors are poorly
immunogenic in response to ZIKV.
RESULTS
Characterization of a 2015 ZIKV Isolate
We obtained a ZIKV strain isolated from Puerto Rico in 2015
(ZIKV-PRVABC59) and propagated multiple stocks on Vero-
E6 cells. Given that the virus formed small, poorly demarcated
plaques in these cells (data not shown), we plaqued the viral
stock on baby hamster kidney (BHK-21J) cells. Small, discern-
able plaques were visualized 4 days after infection (Figure 1A),
and viral titers from three independent preps were approxi-
mately 1.0 3 107 plaque forming units (pfu) per ml. In

 comparison to ZIKV, the related flavivirus yellow fever virus
(YFV) formed large plaques under identical assay conditions
(Figure 1A). Next, we assessed ZIKV infectivity in multiple cell
lines using an antibody (4G2) that detects the dengue virus
(DENV) envelope and cross-reacts with ZIKV (Hamel et al.,
2015). At 24 hr after infection, we observed positive antigen
staining by immunofluorescence in diverse cell types, including
Vero-E6 cells, BHK-21J, Huh7.5, and STAT1�/� human fibro-
blasts (data not shown) (Figure 1B). We also assessed ZIKV
infection by flow cytometry. Viral antigen was detected in
Huh7.5 cells at 24 hr after infection, and considerable viral
spread occurred by 48 hr (Figure 1C). Using a fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS)-based viral titering assay, a ZIKV
growth curve in Huh7.5 cells revealed that that the complete
viral lifecycle of this isolate is just under 20 hr. (Figure 1D).
Given that the 4G2 cross-reacts to both ZIKV from DENV, we
also established a qRT-PCR assay to distinguish these two
viruses (Figure S1A).
Ultrastructural Analysis of Viral Replication
Electron microscopy has been used to detect viral particles in
brain tissue from fetuses with ZIKV infection (Driggers et al.,
2016; Mlakar et al., 2016). Although these studies did not use
immunolabeling to confirm ZIKV, they did show viral particles
and lipid rearrangements characteristic of flavivirus infection.
We used electron microscopy in Huh7.5 cells to compare at
the ultrastructural level three flavivirus infections: DENV (sero-
type 2, strain 16681), YFV (strain 17D), and ZIKV. Consistent
with previous reports (Junjhon et al., 2014; Welsch et al.,
2009), DENV infection resulted in endoplasmic reticulum mem-
brane rearrangements characterized by packets of single-mem-
brane vesicles or so-called ‘‘replication complexes’’ and larger,
gross perturbations referred to as ‘‘convoluted membranes’’
(Figure 1E). Similar to DENV, YFV infection induced vesicle
formation at the ER. However, we rarely observed convoluted
membranes in YFV-infected cells. ZIKV-infected cells had
both vesicle packets and convoluted membranes (Figures 1E
and S1B), suggesting that ZIKV causes cytoplasmic membrane
rearrangements that are more similar to DENV than YFV. We
also noted that ZIKV and DENV induce the formation of large
(>200 nm) invaginated vacuoles that resemble expanded ver-
sions of the smaller replication complexes (Figure S1B). Across
all experiments, we frequently detected YFV particles and
occasionally observed DENV particles but were unable to find
ZIKV particles (Figure S1B). These findings are consistent with
our observation that YFV replicates more robustly than ZIKV
(Figure 1A).
ZIKV Replicates in Primary hNPs
Recent studies have shown that the prototype and contempo-
rary ZIKV strains can infect neural progenitors, neurospheres,
and organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs) or embryonic stem cells (Cugola et al., 2016;
Dang et al., 2016; Garcez et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016; Tang
et al., 2016). However, stem-cell-derived neural progenitors
do not consistently recapitulate in vivo embryonic human brain
gene expression as well as fetal brain-derived primary hNPs
(Stein et al., 2014). Moreover, hNPs are directly obtained
from the tissue of interest with respect to ZIKV pathophysi-
ology, the human fetal brain, whereas iPSCs are derived from
non-neural tissue and might not model all aspects of in vivo
neural cell function with regards to ZIKV tropism. Thus, we
sought to determine whether hNPs were susceptible to the
2015 Puerto Rican ZIKV isolate. We obtained two fetal hNP
lines that were acquired at 16–19 weeks of gestation, a time-
frame of fetal development that correlates with risk for severe
fetal neurologic complications after ZIKV exposure (Rasmussen
et al., 2016). hNP cultures were infected with ZIKV at 0.5 MOI
and processed for immunofluorescence 72 hr after infection
in order to detect viral antigen and the neuronal marker nestin.
In both lines, all cells expressed nestin, and numerous cells
stained positive for ZIKV infection (Figure 2A). When infection
levels were quantified by FACS, we found that approximately
15% of hNPs were ZIKV-positive 48 hr after infection (Figures
2B and 2C).
ZIKV Is Partly Cytopathic, but Poorly Immunogenic,
in hNP
Microscopic analysis of ZIKV-infected hNPs revealed that cyto-
pathic effects were evident as early as day 2 and more pro-
nounced at later time points (Figure 3). These cytopathic effects
appeared similar to those observed in Huh7.5 and STAT1�/�
fibroblasts (Figure 3A) (data not shown). Cell death in hNPs
correlated with an increase in the presence of pyknotic nuclei
(Figure 3B), which were only rarely visualized in uninfected
hNPs (data not shown). Using immunofluorescence, we found
that hNPs with pkynotic nuclei were typically also positive for
ZIKV antigen and activated caspase 3 (Figure 3C). These data
indicate that the mechanism of ZIKV-induced cell death is mot
likely though an apoptotic pathway.
To determine whether the apoptotic phenotype correlated
with an inflammatory response, we used an antibody-based
array to simultaneously detect more than 102 human cytokines
and chemokines. Although multiple cytokines and growth fac-
tors were secreted by hNPs (or present in the culture media),
we found no difference between mock-infected and ZIKV-
infected cultures (Figure S2A). To confirm the array, we used
the more sensitive ELISA to quantify secreted TNFa, a proin-
flammatory cytokine, CCL2, a proinflammatory chemokine,
and CX3CL1, a neuroprotective chemokine that is released
from neurons after toxic insults (Conductier et al., 2010; Lima-
tola and Ransohoff, 2014). In addition to ZIKV infection, we
also treated cells with the viral double-stranded RNA mimic
polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (pIC) and the endotoxin lipopoly-
saccharide (LPS). At 24 hr after treatment, pIC robustly induced
TNFa and CCL2 and moderately induced CXCL3, indicating that
the cells are responsive to immunostimulatory ligands (Fig-
ure 3D). By contrast, LPS and ZIKV did not stimulate cytokine
secretion in hNPs. We confirmed the lack of ZIKV stimulation
by ELISA in a second hNP line at both 24 and 72 hr after infec-
tion (Figures S2B and S2C). We also confirmed LPS bioactivity
by monitoring TNFa and CCL2 induction in THP-1 human
monocytic cells (Figure 3D). Similar to hNPs, ZIKV did not stim-
ulate cytokine secretion in THP-1 cells. Although type I IFNs
were not on the cytokine array, we tested hNP and THP-1 su-
pernatants for IFNa secretion using ELISA. In all conditions,
Cell Reports 15, 2315–2322, June 14, 2016
2317
 the IFNa signal was below the assay’s limit of detection (data
not shown).
We corroborated the ELISA data by measuring cytokine
mRNA induction in hNPs and THP-1 cells. Overall, the data
from qRT-PCR assays were similar to the ELISA results. pIC
induced TNFA, CCL2, and IFNB, but not IFNA, (Figure 3E).
LPS and ZIKV did not induce cytokine mRNA in hNPs, although
LPS readily induced cytokine mRNA in THP-1 cells. In both cell
types, we confirmed ZIKV infection using ZIKV-specific primers.
Together, these results indicate that, although hNPs are immu-
noresponsive to a viral RNA mimic (pIC), under these experi-
mental conditions, they are refractory to the induction of neuro-
inflammatory or neuroprotective cytokines in response to ZIKV.
Persistent ZIKV Production in hNPs
To determine whether the hypoimmune status of hNPs in
response to ZIKV impacted virus replication long term, we moni-
tored virus production in hNPs over a 28 or 12 day timecourse for
hNP lines 1 and 2, respectively. Cells were infected with 0.5 MOI
ZIKV, and viral titers in hNP supernatants were determined on
naive Huh7.5 cell using FACS-based titering (Figure 4). In hNP
line 1, we detected an early rise in viral titers that peaked

lowed by a drop in titer that coincides with the peak of the cyto-
pathic effect. Viral titers peaked again at day 7 and remained at

this level until day 20, when titers rose
slightly for the remainder of the 28 day
timecourse. In hNP line 2, a similar trend
was observed. These data indicate that,
after an initial cytotoxic phase, ZIKV es-
tablishes a persistent infection in this
hNP culture model.
DISCUSSION
Here, we characterized a contemporary

isolate
of
ZIKV
in
cell
cul-
ture. Similar to other strains of ZIKV,
PRVABC59 infects multiple immortalized
cell types and causes classical cyto-
pathic effects. At the ultrastructural level,
ZIKV appears to alter cellular mem-
branes similar to DENV. To develop a
cell-culture model of ZIKV-host interac-
tions that most closely mimics native
ZIKV tropism in utero, we used primary
fetal hNPs. We found that ZIKV infects
hNPs at a relatively low frequency (on
average less than 20% of cells). The
initial acute phase of infection was char-
acterized by cytopathic effects in a subset of cells, with cell
rounding, pkynotic nuclei, and positive staining for acti-
vated caspase 3. Occasionally, activated caspase 3 was

 observed in ZIKV-negative cells that were in close proximity
to an infected cell, suggesting that apoptotic pathways in
hNPs may be activated through both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic
mechanisms. However, regarding the latter, we were unable to
detect the production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemo-
kines, or antiviral IFNs in ZIKV-infected hNP supernatants at
24 hr or 72 hr after infection. Although a short-lived response
at earlier time points may have been missed under our experi-
mental conditions, the lack of virus-induced cytokine protein
accumulation at 24 hr suggests that hNPs have limited immu-
nogenic effects in response to ZIKV. However, hNPs can mount
immune responses since they responded robustly to a viral
RNA mimic. Thus, our data indicate that, although ZIKV causes
cell death in hNPs, either the virus is relatively stealthy with
respect to modulating immune pathways or isolated hNPs
possess an inherent hypoimmunogenicity with respect to
ZIKV infection. This latter speculation is supported by previous
studies
characterizing
neural
progenitors
as
possessing
inherent immune privilege in experimental allograft models
(Hori et al., 2003). Additional studies in hNPs are needed to
test these hypotheses. Moreover, given that our hNP cell-cul-
ture model is a reductionist system, comprehensive immuno-
pathological studies in ZIKV-infected fetal brain tissue are
also needed. It is likely that glial progenitors and microglia,
the main producers of inflammatory mediators in the brain,
will also play a role in the pathophysiology of ZIKV in vivo.
We also found that ZIKV persistently replicates in hNPs. After
the initial cytopathic phase, a proportion of cells survive
and continue to produce the virus. We confirmed this in two
independent hNP lines, with one line producing virus for up to
28 days. This observation correlates with clinical pathological
findings in infected fetuses (Driggers et al., 2016; Mlakar
et al., 2016). In one study, ZIKV particles were observed in fetal
brain tissue 19 weeks after presumed maternal infection (Mla-
kar et al., 2016). Thus, our hNP model of ZIKV infection mirrors
viral persistence in vivo. The exact nature of this persistence re-
mains to be determined. Specifically, we do not know whether
the persistently produced virus results from a focal infection
(i.e., only a few cells) or a diffuse, steady-state infection or
whether replicated virus segregates to daughter cells during
cell division.
Beyond neuronal cells, recent studies on ZIKV sexual trans-
mission suggest viral persistence outside the CNS, namely the
testes. Indeed, infectious ZIKV has been isolated from the semen
of an infected male several weeks after the onset of symptoms
(Mansuy et al., 2016). In support of these findings, in ZIKV-in-
fected mice high viral titers were found 6 days after infection in
not only in the brain and spinal cord but also the testes (Lazear
et al., 2016). Other studies have reported ZIKV-induced disor-
ders of the retina (de Paula Freitas et al., 2016; Ventura et al.,
2016), suggesting either direct or indirect effects of ZIKV in
certain ocular cell types. Thus, the process that seems to unify
ZIKV tropism, persistence, and both vertical and sexual trans-
mission is access to sites of immune privilege (fetus, eyes, and
testes). Similar to our hNP model, these sites may be immunoto-
lerant to ZIKV, thereby increasing the potential for viral persis-
tence and pathological sequelae.
Although ZIKV infection in hNPs models certain aspects of
clinical pathological findings (neuronal death followed by
persistent virus replication), many questions remain unan-
swered. It is tempting to speculate that the mechanisms under-
lying ZIKV-induced microcephaly are simply due to direct injury
to neural progenitor cells, as used in our study, or to progenitor
cells in the brain such as radial glial cells (Nowakowski et al.,
2016). However, the pathology may be more complex and
include direct or indirect effects on neuronal progenitor prolifer-
ation or symmetric or asymmetric division, neuronal differen-
tiation or migration, and/or neuron-glial interactions (Cugola
et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016). The hNP culture system has been
previously validated for its utility in generating neurons at
various stages of differentiation (Konopka et al., 2012; Stein
et al., 2014). Thus, future studies that take advantage of these

 features of the hNP culture system may be instrumental in un-
covering molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysio-
logical effects of ZIKV.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cells and Viruses
Cell cultures and viral stocks were generated with standard techniques. See
the Supplemental Information for details.
Virus Infections and Titer Determination
For FACS and viral growth-curve experiments, cells were plated in 24-well
plates at 100,000–150,000 cells per well. Cells were infected with ZIKV at
an MOI of 0.5 for 1 hr at 37�C under 5% CO2. At indicated times, cells
were harvested using Accumax (Sigma-Aldrich) and fixed using a BD
Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (Fisher Scientific). Cells were stained with primary
antibody, anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody, clone D1-4G2-4-15 (Milli-
pore), and secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) Alexa Fluor
488 (Life Technologies). Samples were run on an S1000 flow cytometer
(Stratedigm) and analyzed in FlowJo. For Huh7.5 and hNP viral growth
curves, cells were infected with 0.5 MOI ZIKV, washed three times with
PBS+/+, and incubated in DMEM (Huh7.5) or hNP-proliferation media for
the indicated time. Supernatants were collected and stored at �80�C.
Thawed supernatants were centrifuged in order to remove cell debris and
titered on Huh7.5 cells. See the Supplemental Information for details on
viral titering assays.
Indirect Immunofluorescence
Immortalized cells and hNP lines were infected with ZIKV and processed for
antibody staining by immunofluorescence. See the Supplemental Information
for details.
Electron Microscopy
Huh7.5 cells were infected with 1.5 MOI YFV for 24 hr, 3 MOI DENV for 48 hr,
4 MOI ZIKV for 24 hr, or 1 MOI ZIKV for 48 hr and processed for transmission
electron microscopy. See the Supplemental Information for details.
Cytokine Arrays and ELISA
Cell supernatants were collected 24 or 72 hr after infection and frozen
at �80�C. Thawed samples were applied to Human XL Cytokine Array
(ARY022, R&D Systems) per kit protocols. For increased sensitivity, the
maximum volume of supernatant (500 ml) was used on the array. ELISA kits
to detect TNFa, CCL2, and CXCL3 (R&D Systems) or IFNa (PBL Assay
Science) were used according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
RT-PCR of Viral Genomes and Cellular Genes
Huh7.5 cells were infected with titrating doses of DENV-IC30-P-A or ZIKV
for 1 hr. hNP were infected with 0.5 MOI ZIKV, treated with 10 ng/ml pIC
(Invivogen), or treated with 100 ng/ml LPS (Sigma-Aldrich). Total RNA was
extracted 24 hr later using an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). 50 ng total RNA
was used in QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR reactions (QIAGEN) in order
to detect the following viral or cellular mRNAs: ZIKV, DENV, TNFA, CCL2,
IFNA, IFNB, and RPS11. All samples were normalized to housekeeping gene
RPS11. Samples were run on 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Life Technol-
ogies). Primer information is available upon request.
Statistical Analysis
For FACS-based analysis of hNP infectivity, statistical analysis was deter-
mined by Mann-Whitney test. For ELISA assays to measure cytokines in
hNPs, statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA with
Dunnett’s test for multiple comparisons. For RT-PCR assays to measure
cytokine mRNA or ZIKV RNA, statistical significance was determined by
one-way ANOVA with Kruskal-Wallis’ test (non-parametric) for multiple
comparisons.
