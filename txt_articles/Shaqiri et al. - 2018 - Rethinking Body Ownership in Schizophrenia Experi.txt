Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder, in which 
patients experience an abnormal sense of self. While deficits 
in sensorimotor self-representation (agency) are well docu-
mented in schizophrenia, less is known about other aspects of 
bodily self-representation (body ownership). Here, we tested 
a large cohort (N = 59) of chronic schizophrenia patients and 
matched controls (N = 30) on a well-established body illusion 
paradigm, the Full Body Illusion (FBI). In this paradigm, 
changes in body ownership are induced through prolonged 
multisensory stimulation, in which participants are stroked 
on their back while seeing the stroking on the back of a vir-
tual body. When the felt and seen stroking are synchronous, 
participants typically feel higher identification with the seen 
body as well as a drift in self-location towards it. However, 
when the stroking is asynchronous, no such changes occur. 
Our results show no evidence for abnormal body ownership 
in schizophrenia patients. A meta-analysis of previous work 
corroborates this result. Thus, while schizophrenia patients 
may be impaired in the sense of agency, their multisensory 
bodily self-representation, as tested here, seems to be unaf-
fected by the illness.

Introduction
Schizophrenia has been conceptualized as a disorder 
of the self,1–3 in which the typical segregation of the self 
from the environment and other conspecifics is altered or 
weakened. It has been argued that this may account for 
symptoms such as auditory verbal hallucinations, passivity 
symptoms (feeling of external control over one’s actions) 
or thought insertion (feeling that one’s thoughts are those 
of another person).4–9 Two main aspects of the self have 
been highlighted in this context in the past5: First, the sense 
of agency, refers to the feeling that we are the authors of 
our actions. Agency is thought to be based on sensorimo-
tor brain mechanisms allowing us to discriminate self-gen-
erated actions from those caused by external sources.10–15 
Second, the sense of ownership refers to the feeling that 
the body belongs to the self, and has been related to the 
integration of multisensory bodily signals.16–23
A large volume of research has linked deficits in the 
sense of agency with schizophrenia,6,9,24–29 giving rise to 
the hypothesis that abnormal sensorimotor signal inte-
gration is fundamentally linked to agency deficits (ie, 
loss of agency for one’s action) and may account for 
some of the symptoms found in psychotic states.7,30,31 
Comparatively, the study of the sense of ownership in 
schizophrenia has been relatively neglected. The sense 
of ownership is typically studied using bodily illusions, 
such as the rubber hand illusion (RHI)32–34 or a full body 
version of this illusion, termed the Full body illusion 
(FBI).18,19,35 Both illusions are based on visuo-tactile 
conflicts, in which the hand or the back of the partici-
pants are stroked while they view a spatially displaced 
hand or body being stroked. When the viewed and felt 
stroking are synchronous, the multisensory conflict dur-
ing stimulation (stroking is felt on the back but seen on 
another person’s back) gives rise to an altered state of 
bodily self-consciousness, including subjective changes 
in body ownership, a modulation of the sense of self 
location (which is judged to be closer to the seen body),

as well as physiological changes, such as lower body 
temperature.16,18,19,36
Several studies have attempted to probe the sense of own-
ership for a limb in schizophrenia, employing the RHI par-
adigm,22,37–39 and have yielded mixed results. Some of these 
studies have shown an increased illusion effect (ie, higher 
illusion scores and/or more rapid onset) in schizophrenia 
patients,37,38,40 which has been interpreted as evidence for 
abnormal body ownership processing in schizophrenia 
(see table 1 for details on these studies). However, a closer 
look at the results of these studies shows that they did not 
include control conditions typically used in RHI32–34,36,41,42 
such as asynchronous visuo-tactile stroking, or control 
questions (CONQ) to test for response biases, thus, leav-
ing the possibility that the results did not stem from the 
multisensory integration processes thought to underlie the 
RHI32,34 but rather from a response bias in the schizophre-
nia patients (table 1). Two RHI studies, which employed 
both synchronous and asynchronous stroking conditions, 
as well as objective measures of proprioceptive drift, have

Body Ownership in Schizophrenia
found no interaction between group and synchrony for the 
subjective aspects of the illusion (Note however that both 
of these studies found higher subjective ratings for both 
synchronous and asynchronous conditions suggesting that 
schizophrenia patient tend to respond with higher ratings 
to such questions, even in a condition that does not elicit 
the illusion in healthy participants, a finding which has been 
replicated in many studies, including the current one.).22,39 
For the proprioceptive drift measures, one study reported 
large synchrony dependent differences between the control 
and schizophrenia groups,22 while the other found no differ-
ences for the schizophrenia patients (Note that in the study 
by Kaplan and colleagues39, the schizophrenia group was 
a control group to compare with body dismorphic disor-
der patients.).39 Furthermore, these previous studies have 
employed a low number of patients (M = 23.2, SD = 4.7) 
with limited statistical power. Thus, while claims for abnor-
mal ownership in schizophrenia have been widely cited 
and discussed,23,43–46 the empirical support for such claims 
is quite limited (see table 1 and meta-analysis below). The 
current study investigated body ownership in a large cohort 
of chronic schizophrenia patients (N = 59) and matched 
controls (N = 30) using the FBI, which has been used exten-
sively in healthy participants18,19,35,47–50 but not in patients 
with schizophrenia. Using both subjective measures and 
objective measures of body ownership, as well as Bayesian 
statistics, we found no evidence for abnormal body own-
ership in schizophrenia. Furthermore, a systematic review 
and meta-analysis of the previous experimental studies of 
body ownership in schizophrenia indicated no substantial 
evidence for differential body ownership in schizophrenia.
Methods
Participants
Fifty-nine schizophrenia patients and 30 controls par-
ticipated in the study. Groups are described in table 2. 
Schizophrenia patients were recruited from the Gotsiridze 
psycho-neurological dispensary and the Asatiani psy-
chiatric hospital and rehabilitation center of Tbilisi, 
Georgia.53,54 Healthy controls were recruited from the 
general population. We excluded all participants with 
neurological disorders, with traumatic brain injury or 
with a history of drug or alcohol abuse.
The study was approved by the ethics committee 
of the Georgian National Council on Bioethics and in 
accord with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. 
Participants signed informed consent and were informed 
that they could quit the experiment at any time.
Diagnosis and Psychopathology
Patients were diagnosed using the DSM-IV by means of 
an interview based on the SCID. Psychopathology was 
assessed by the Scale for the Assessment of Negative 
(SANS) and Positive (SAPS) Symptoms, carried out by 
an experienced senior psychiatrist (E.C.). All patients 
were under neuroleptic medication. Chlorpromazine 
equivalents are reported in table 2.
Procedure
The FBI setup with a body viewed from the back was 
employed.18,35 Participants stood with their back towards 
a camera, positioned 2 meters behind them (figure 1). The 
video of their back was projected onto a head-mounted 
display (HMD) in real time (synchronous condition) 
or with a 800 ms delay (asynchronous condition). The 
camera was controlled by an in-house software ExpyVR 
(http://lnco.epfl.ch/expyvr). Participants were exposed 
to each condition once, in a randomized order. During 
each condition, the participants’ back was stroked by the 
experimenter with a long wooden stick in an irregular 
fashion. Participants could see the stroking (but not the 
experimenter) in the HMD. Participants were instructed 
to keep their eyes open and fixate the middle of their 
back without moving their body. Each condition lasted 
for 1.5 minutes, after which the HMD went black, and 
participants were instructed to close their eyes. At this 
point, global self-localization (drift) was measured: par-
ticipants were gently displaced 1.5 meters backwards by 
the experimenter, making very small shuffling steps (a 
procedure practiced beforehand). Participants had to 
then walk back with normal steps to the location where 
they felt they stood before (keeping their eyes closed). 
The experimenter measured the distance between their 
initial position during the experimental block and the 
position participants walked to. White noise was continu-
ously played through headphones during the procedure. 
After these measurements were taken, participants were 
randomly displaced in the room to preclude any feedback 
about their accuracy when they opened their eyes. They 
could then open their eyes, sit down, and fill out a ques-
tionnaire on self-identification with the illusory body.

Body Ownership Questionnaire
We used a typical questionnaire employed in previous stud-
ies using the FBI18,35,55 which were translated to Georgian 
by 2 of the authors (M.R. and E.C.). The questionnaire 
included 8 items of which 3 aimed at measuring body own-
ership (experimental questions [EXPQ]: questions 1 to 
3) and the other 5 (CONQ) were used to control for sug-
gestibility or other response biases (figure 1). The measure-
ment of subjective changes in body ownership induced by 
illusions such as the RHI and FBI typically rely on compar-
ing subjective responses on items known to be modified by 
the visuo-tactile illusion with those which are not.18,19,32,55–57
Responses were given on a Likert type visual scale 
with 7 levels describing the level of agreement with the 
question ranging from disagree strongly (−−−) to agree 
strongly (+++).
Data Analysis
Subjective Responses and Bayesian Analysis. Subjective 
responses on the questionnaire were transformed to 
numerical score (+3 to −3) and averaged for the questions 
probing the illusion (EXPQ: Q1–Q3) and the control 
questions (CONQ: Q4–Q8) for the synchronous (synch) 
and asynchronous (asynch) condition for each partici-
pant. The data where then analyzed using a 2 (EXPQ/
CONQ) × 2 (synch/asynch) repeated measures ANOVA 
with group (healthy controls/schizophrenia patients 
[HTY/SCZ]) as a between subject factor.
We performed a Bayesian analysis using the method 
of Gallistel58 in order to test the strength of the evidence 
relating to the null hypothesis (see also Cappe59). We ran a 
Bayesian repeated measures ANOV
A on the questionnaire 
data, with group (HTY/SCZ) as a between subject factor 
and (synch/asynch) as a within subject factor using the 
JASP software (JASP team, 2016). This approach allows 
to measure if the null hypothesis is more likely or less likely, 
given the data. Further exploratory, post hoc, analyses tak-
ing into account the Scale for the Assessment of Negative 
(SANS) and Positive Symptoms (SAPS) were performed. 
Patients were divided into high and low SAPS and SANS 
groups based on a median split of the data. Two separate 
repeated measure ANOV
As with question type (EXPQ/
CONQ) × synchrony (synch/asynch) as within subject fac-
tors and group (HTY/SCZ High SAPS/SCZ Low SAPS) 
as a between subject factor were conducted (one for SAPS 
and one for SANS). We further ran identical Bayesian 
repeated measures ANOV
As with subject as a random 
effect using BayesFactor60 package in R software (Rteam).
Global self-localization was measured as the difference 
between the participant original location and the location 
to which they arrived when asked to return to the origi-
nal location.18 The distance in centimeters was analyzed 
using a repeated measures ANOVA with (synch/asynch) 
as a within subject factor and group (HTY/SCZ) as a 
between subject factor.
Ranking and Power Analyses. If the data from the sub-
jective responses on the EXPQ of the questionnaire and 
from the drift were correlated, we would expect participants 
who show a high illusion score to also have a large score 
on the drift. In the extreme case, we would expect the par-
ticipant with the highest score on the questions and drift 
to be ranked first, the second to be ranked second in all

Body Ownership in Schizophrenia
measures, and so on. On the other hand, if having high 
scores on questions is unrelated to performance in the drift 
test, then we would expect each participant’s rank over the 
scores to average around the middle rank (ie, 25 for the 
schizophrenia patients and 15 for the controls). In this case, 
participants’ score should also not be different from a rank 
that was assigned randomly during a simulation. This was 
assessed using a rank analysis (figure 3), in which we tested 
if the performance of our participants differs from a simu-
lation where we assign a random rank to each participant.
Finally, to assure that our null results do not stem from 
a lack of statistical power, we computed a power analysis 
using GPower.61 In addition, we did not adjust for mul-
tiple comparisons in order to have a conservative estimate 
for null effects.
Meta-analysis. We searched in Google Scholar and 
PubMed for all published studies using the keywords 
or the association of keywords: out of body experience/
RHI and schizophrenia or out of body experience/RHI 
and psychosis. The search revealed k = 7 studies that cor-
responded to those criteria. Out of those 7 studies, we 
removed studies which did not include both synchronous 
and asynchronous visuo-tactile conditions (as they do 
not allow to control for documented response biases in 
schizophrenia cohorts). We also removed studies that did 
not have 2 groups (patients and controls), as this does not 
allow for group comparison. We performed a meta-analy-
sis on the remaining 3 studies and also in a second step, we 
included the results of the current study (supplementary 
figure 1). For each study, we calculated the Cohen’s d for 
the interaction between the synchrony condition (synch/
asynch) and the group factor (HTY/SCZ). Standardized 
effect sizes (Hedges’ g) were calculated using Cohen’s d 
multiplied by the coefficient J, which is a correction for 
small samples.62 Hedges’ g were introduced as a generic 
effect size in the OpenMeta Analyst software (http://
www.cebm.brown.edu/openmeta/) with the correspond-
ing variance (SE). We used the continuous random-effect 
analysis with the DerSimonian-Laird (DL) method. The 
meta-analysis software computed 95% CI and the pooled 
effect size g*. We note that our meta-analysis, while 
including all relevant studies, is based on a small number 
of published papers (for similar examples see63–66) and has 
low statistical power and therefore should be viewed as 
a statistical aggregate of current evidence on this topic. 
Furthermore, meta-analyses are known to suffer from 
publication bias in which typically only studies with sig-
nificant effects are included. Given the low number of 
studies on this topic, it is not possible yet to formally test 
for a publication bias.67 However, it has been suggested 
that publication bias is present in ~40% of meta-analysis 
such that meta-analytic effects are often larger than the 
true effect. Thus it is possible that the result of the meta-
analysis is in fact higher than the true effect.68–70
Results
Subjective Responses
As expected, an ANOVA indicated a significant main 
effect of question type (F(1,87) = 187.1, P < .001, ƞ2 = 
0.68) with higher responses on the EXPQ (M = 1.75, SD 
= 1.6) than on the CONQ (M = −1.48, SD = 1.75). The 
effect of synchrony was also significant (F(1,87) = 6.48, 
P = .013, ƞ2 = 0.068), with higher responses for questions 
in the synch condition (M = 0.23, SD = 2.33) than in the 
asynch condition (M = 0.04, SD = 2.33). The effect of 
group was significant as well (F(1,87) = 42.2, P = .002, ƞ2 
= 0.1), with higher responses given by the SCZ group (M 
= 0.38, SD = 2.29) than in the HTY group (M = −0.35, 
SD = 2.33). Critically, the interaction between question 
type and synchrony was also significant (F(1,87) = 4.6, 
P = .034, ƞ2 = 0.05). This was driven by a significant 
modulation of the EXPQ by synchrony (P = .01) while 
the CONQ was not (P = .65, see figure 2). Importantly, 
the 3-way interaction between question type, synchrony 
and group was not significant and had a very small effect 
size (F(1,87) = 0.26, P = .6, ƞ2 = 0.003). Bayesian analysis 
of the null results indicated a BF10 = 0.014, suggesting a 
very strong evidence for the null hypothesis. While not of 
direct interest to our hypothesis, we nevertheless ran an 
exploratory post hoc analysis on the questions by group 
(P = .73, BF10 = 0.37) and the synchrony by group inter-
actions (P = .16, BF10 = 0.12), which were not significant 
(for details, see supplementary table 1).
A post hoc analysis based on the SANS and SAPS 
scores indicated that even when the patient groups were 
median-split based upon their symptom clusters, there 
was no difference (ie, no 3-way interaction between 
synchrony by question type by group). This was the 
case for both the SAPS or the SANS based division of 
the data (F(2, 86) = 1.57, P = .21 and F(2, 86) = 1.67, 
P = .19, respectively). Further, Bayesian ANOVAs indi-
cated that for both the SAPS and the SANS division 
of the data, there was higher evidence for the model 
of the 2-way synchrony by question type interaction 
than the model including the 3-way synchrony by 
question type by group interaction (BF10SAPS = 4.31, 
BF10SANS = 2.74).
Self-localization
The ANOVA on global self-localization drift measures 
indicated no difference between the groups (MSCZ = 3.09, 
SEM = 3.48; MHTY = 4.96, SEM = 4.89, P = .79), nor 
an effect of synchrony (Msynch = 5.11, SEM = 4.16; 
Masynch = 2.33, SEM = 3.85, P = .51), or an interaction 
between the 2 factors (MSCZ-synch = 4.15, SEM = 4.85, 
MSCZ-asynch = 2.04, SEM = 5.02, MHTY-synch = 7.01, 
SEM = 7.95, MHTY-asynch = 2.91, SEM = 5.82, 
P = .83).

Ranking and Power Analyses
We ranked the scores of the schizophrenia patients and 
controls in the EXPQ of the FBI questionnaire and the 
drift (after z transforming the scores). We then sorted 
the scores and plotted them from smallest to the largest. 
We then ran a simulation, in which we simulated more 
than 10 000 sets of observers, in which the ranked score 
of one observer was independent from the ranked score 
of another observer (using a permutation of the real 
data). We plotted those random-simulated data next to 
the data of our participants (figure 3). A Chi-squared 
test did not reveal a significant difference between 
the simulation and the scores of our schizophrenia or 
control participants for the EXPQ and the drift (X2(2, 
N = 58) = 6.32, P = 1 and X2(2, N = 29) = 3.90, P = 1, 
respectively).
Finally, we performed a power analysis. With 89 par-
ticipants in total (59 patients and 30 controls), we had the 
power to detect an effect size of 0.68, which is a medium 
effect size according to Cohen.71
Meta-analysis
Effect sizes in studies that examined the interaction 
between condition and group were not significant 
(N = 134, k = 3, g = 0.005, CI −0.964 to 0.974, P = .992). 
The meta-analysis shows therefore, that across studies, 
there is no difference for illusion scores between groups 
(HTY/SCZ) based on the visuo-tactile condition (synch/

examining the interaction between condition and group. 
Those results were confirmed by the addition of our cur-
rent study in the meta-analysis (supplementary figure 1). 
We note that the restricted number of studies in this field 
allows limited statistical power on their meta-analytical 
effect and should be regarded as such.
Discussion
Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disease and abnormal 
functions are constantly found, including cognitive72 and 
perceptual deficits,54 abnormal brain morphology73 con-
nectivity,74 and even an abnormal immune system75 (for 
reviews see76,77). Recently, the bias towards publication 
of significant positive results (publication bias) and low 
powered studies78 have been suggested as possible causes 
of overestimation of effects and low reproducibility rates 
in science. In clinical research,79 including schizophrenia 
research, intact functions are reported to a lesser degree, 
causing a publication bias towards highlighting deficien-
cies in schizophrenia.80,81 For example, a recent study 
found no differences between schizophrenia patients and 
controls in 7 different perceptual illusions (Grzeczkowski 
Fig. 3. Ranking analysis for schizophrenia patients and controls. We calculated the mean rank across all participants for the 
experimental questions (EXPQ) and the drift. We then ran 10 000 simulations for a random set of participants, where the scores for the 
questions would be independent of the score for another question or from the drift. The simulation matched the data. Error bars are the 
SDs of the ranks.

subjective experience. We found a main effect of the questions 
type (experimental vs control questions), for the synchronous 
compared to asynchronous conditions (higher responses for the 
synchronous condition), as well as a group effect, with higher 
scores for schizophrenia patients compared to controls.

Body Ownership in Schizophrenia
L, Shaqiri A, Roinishvili M, et al., in preparation, 2016), 
suggesting intact perceptual processing capabilities which 
have not previously been reported. This is particularly 
important for a heterogeneous disease such as schizo-
phrenia, in which variability in functioning and symp-
toms is considerable.82,83
Here, we report that body ownership, as determined 
by the FBI, shows no evidence for differential process-
ing between healthy controls and schizophrenia patients. 
Our results contrast with previous reports that used the 
RHI, which have found higher subjective ratings for illu-
sory body ownership in schizophrenia.22,40 However, 2 of 
these studies did not use asynchronous control condi-
tions,38,40 making it difficult to establish if the results are 
due to a response bias in the schizophrenia patient group 
(who tend to give higher responses to ownership ques-
tions and often control questions irrespectively of visuo-
tactile synchrony), as we found in the current study, as 
well as reported by other studies.22,39 We note that such a 
response tendency, irrespective of the synchrony of the 
multisensory signals and often extending to control ques-
tions may be explained in several ways. First, it is possible 
that schizophrenia patients have a tendency to agree more 
strongly with questionnaire items in general (ie, response 
bias). Second, it is possible that the mere viewing of a 
fake hand or body induces anomalous body sensations 
in these patients which extend beyond the findings in 
healthy subjects thus including questionnaire items not 
typically experienced by healthy subjects (ie, visually 
induced ownership). Finally, it is possible that irrespec-
tive of any of the experimental manipulations, the schizo-
phrenia patients have an atypical bodily experience. 
These possibilities, while clinically interesting, all suggest 
that this response tendency is unrelated to the multisen-
sory mechanisms underlying body ownership in the RHI 
and FBI16,17,21,84 for which the patients and participants 
showed no difference in the current study.
Thus, while there has been much discussion in the sci-
entific literature regarding abnormal body ownership 
in schizophrenia, there have been very few studies pub-
lished, and even these few studies have yielded mixed 
results.22,38,40,85 Two possibilities may explain the differ-
ence between our current results, showing no differential 
body ownership modulation between synchronous and 
asynchronous conditions between healthy controls and 
chronic schizophrenia patients, and the previous reports 
of abnormal body ownership in patients. First, it may be 
that there is no difference in body ownership related to 
multisensory conflicts (ie, synchrony dependent) between 
healthy and schizophrenia patients, but rather a response 
bias for higher illusion ratings in schizophrenia. This 
interpretation of our null results is well corroborated 
by Bayesian, power and rank analyses. We note that, 
our study included a large sample size (to date, the larg-
est used in a study of body ownership in schizophrenia 
with more than twice the sample size of the second larg-
est study). Taken together with the sparse and conflict-
ing results of previous studies on this topic as well as our 
meta-analysis showing no effect of group based on the 
synchrony by group interaction, we believe that there is 
little evidence for a disturbance of body ownership in 
schizophrenia. Alternatively, one must consider the pos-
sibility that the difference between studies stems from 
the paradigms employed here (FBI) vs the one used in 
previous experiments (RHI). It may be that multisensory 
processes underlying body ownership illusions for body 
parts (ie, RHI) differ from those responsible for Full 
body ownership (ie, FBI). It has been argued that mul-
tisensory signals, as employed during the FBI, relate to 
global aspects of bodily self-consciousness (self-location 
and first person perspective16,86,87) due to interference 
with trunk-related multisensory signals in the FBI, but 
not the RHI. Previous reports of enhanced subjective 
RHI,40 larger proprioceptive drift without altered sub-
jective experience22 or decreased51 RHI in schizophrenia 
patients would thus point to a deficit in limb ownership 
(ie, the hand) rather than deficits in body ownership (the 
full body) as investigated here. Further research is neces-
sary, directly comparing RHI and FBI, although the FBI 
and its interference with global aspects of bodily self-
consciousness is arguably more relevant to the disturbed 
global representation of self, which has been argued to be 
a key deficit in schizophrenia.2,3,8,63 The scarcity of results 
supporting abnormal body ownership in schizophrenia 
is strongly contrasted with the abundance of results for 
abnormal sense of agency in schizophrenia.9,24–28 This 
suggests the possibility of a publication bias for body 
ownership deficits in schizophrenia. However, the low 
number of published papers does not allow to the neces-
sary power for a P-curve analysis, to test this possibility.

Limitations
One drawback of our study is that while a significant 
effect for the illusion was found for the questionnaire, no 
significant effects were found for the drift measure. While 
the drift in the synchronous conditions was numerically 
higher than in the asynchronous conditions, we found a 
high variability in the drift measure. It is possible that the 
wide range of participants’ ages (range 17–55) may have 
increased the variability of the drift measure as it has been 
shown to differ between age groups.88 Moreover, several 
previous studies using the RHI22,42 and FBI19,87,89 have 
shown that proprioceptive drift and subjective experience 
measures do not always correspond and may reflect dif-
ferent aspects of body ownership.42,89,90 Finally, as noted 
above, our meta-analysis while fully inclusive, is based on 
the limited number of studies available on the topic and 
therefore has limited statistical power.
Taken together, the current work suggests that the 
notion of abnormal body ownership in schizophrenia is 
not well supported by empirical evidence. Further well-
controlled experiments using several delays, object con-
trol conditions and higher powered studies are required 
before any such claims can be made. Furthermore, of 
the 2 aspects of the self defined by Gallagher,5 it seems 
that not all functions related to the self are disturbed in 
schizophrenia. Deficits relating to the sense of agency 
and sensorimotor predictions have been replicated across 
several paradigms and modalities25–31 while the current 
results and meta-analysis suggest that there is no deficit 
in body ownership aspect of schizophrenia. This is an 
important distinction, allowing a realistic picture of the 
deficits of the self in this disease while recognizing that 
other aspects of the self remain intact.
