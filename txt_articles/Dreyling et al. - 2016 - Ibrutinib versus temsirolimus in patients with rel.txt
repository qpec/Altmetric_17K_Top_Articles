Summary
Background Mantle-cell lymphoma is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma with a poor prognosis. Both ibrutinib and 
temsirolimus have shown single-agent activity in patients with relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma. We 
undertook a phase 3 study to assess the effi
  cacy and safety of ibrutinib versus temsirolimus in relapsed or refractory 
mantle-cell lymphoma.
Methods This randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 clinical trial enrolled patients with relapsed or refractory 
mantle-cell lymphoma confi
 rmed by central pathology in 21 countries who had received one or more rituximab-
containing treatments. Patients were stratifi
 ed by previous therapy and simplifi
 ed mantle-cell lymphoma international 
prognostic index score, and were randomly assigned with a computer-generated randomisation schedule to receive 
daily oral ibrutinib 560 mg or intravenous temsirolimus (175 mg on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1; 75 mg on days 1, 8, 
and 15 of subsequent 21-day cycles). Randomisation was balanced by using randomly permuted blocks. The primary 
effi
  cacy endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by a masked independent review committee with the primary 
hypothesis that ibrutinib compared with temsirolimus signifi
 cantly improves progression-free survival. The analysis 
followed the intention-to-treat principle. The trial is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number 
NCT01646021) and with the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT (number 2012-000601-74).
Findings Between Dec 10, 2012, and Nov 26, 2013, 280 patients were randomised to ibrutinib (n=139) or temsirolimus 
(n=141). Primary effi
  cacy analysis showed signifi
 cant improvement in progression-free survival (p<0∙0001) for patients 
treated with ibrutinib versus temsirolimus (hazard ratio 0∙43 [95% CI 0∙32–0∙58]; median progression-free survival 
14∙6 months [95% CI 10·4–not estimable] vs 6∙2 months [4·2–7·9], respectively). Ibrutinib was better tolerated than 
temsirolimus, with grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events reported for 94 (68%) versus 121 (87%) 
patients, and fewer discontinuations of study medication due to adverse events for ibrutinib versus temsirolimus 
(9 [6%] vs 36 [26%]).
Interpretation Ibrutinib treatment resulted in signifi
 cant improvement in progression-free survival and better 
tolerability versus temsirolimus in patients with relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma. These data lend further 
support to the positive benefi
 t–risk ratio for ibrutinib in relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma.

Introduction
Mantle-cell lymphoma, an incurable B-cell lymphoma, 
accounts for 6–8% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas, with 
an annual incidence of 0∙4 per 100 000 persons in the 
USA and Europe.1 Mantle-cell lymphoma most often 
aff
 ects men older than 60 years, generally presents as 
late-stage disease, and has a median overall survival of 
4–5 years.2 Patients with relapsed disease respond poorly 
to chemotherapy and progress rapidly, resulting in a 
median overall survival of 1–2 years. Despite recent 
advances, and with the exception of a small patient 
population eligible for allogeneic stem cell trans-
plantation, there is no globally recognised standard of 
care in relapsed mantle-cell lymphoma.3–5
Ibrutinib is a fi
 rst-in-class, once-daily, oral, covalently 
binding inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase. Bruton’s 
tyrosine kinase belongs to the cytoplasmic tyrosine 
kinase family (Tec kinases) and is important for B-cell 
receptor signalling and other pathways downstream of 
the B-cell receptor.6 Ibrutinib binds to a cysteine residue 
(Cys481) in the active site of the ATP-binding domain of 
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase, which then inhibits B-cell 
receptor signalling within the malignant B cell with 
downstream mitigation of cell growth, proliferation, 
survival, adhesion, and migration.7–12

  cacy results from previous studies have shown

rate of 68%, with a complete response rate of 21%, and a 
median duration of response of 17∙5 months.13 A longer-
term follow-up (median 26∙7 months) of this study 
reported 
a 
median 
progression-free 
survival 
of 
13∙0 
months 
and 
median 
overall 
survival 
of 
22∙5 months, respectively.14 A phase 2 single-agent 
study of ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory 
mantle-cell lymphoma who had received a rituximab-
containing regimen and had progressed after two or 
more cycles of bortezomib therapy had an overall 
response rate of 62∙7%, with a complete response rate 
of 20∙9%.15
Based on the phase 1b/2 results, ibrutinib at a dose of 
560 mg per day has been approved in the USA, the 
European Union, and many other countries for patients 
with mantle-cell lymphoma who have received at least 
one previous line of therapy.
Temsirolimus is an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway that 
has been shown to be frequently activated in mantle-cell 
lymphoma.16 In two phase 2 studies, temsirolimus at 
various doses achieved response rates of about 40% in 
relapsed mantle-cell lymphoma.17,18 In the European 
Union, temsirolimus is approved based on a phase 3 
study in relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma. 
Temsirolimus at the same dosing used in this study 
resulted in signifi
 cantly longer progression-free survival 
versus 
investigator’s 
choice 
single-agent 
therapy 
(4∙8 months vs 1∙9 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0∙44 
[97·5% CI 0·25–0·78]; p=0∙0009). The overall response 
rate for temsirolimus was 22%, with a median overall 
survival of 12∙8 months.19
This study (MCL3001) assesses the effi
  cacy of these two 
approved targeted approaches in patients with relapsed or 
refractory mantle-cell lymphoma, was performed in 
collaboration with the European MCL Network, and was 
undertaken in the European Union, Latin America, and 
Asia-Pacifi
 c.
Methods 
Study design and participants
This randomised, controlled, open-label, multicentre, 
phase 3 study compared the effi
  cacy and safety of 
ibrutinib with temsirolimus in patients with relapsed or 
refractory mantle-cell lymphoma confi
 rmed by central 
pathology. Between Dec 10, 2012, and Nov 26, 2013, 
patients with one or more previous rituximab-containing 
chemotherapy regimens were enrolled and randomised 
to oral ibrutinib 560 mg or intravenous temsirolimus 
175 mg for a 3-week cycle followed by 75 mg (appendix). 
Eligible patients had at least one previous rituximab-
containing chemotherapy regimen, documented relapse, 
or disease progression after the last anti-mantle-cell 
lymphoma treatment, measurable disease by Revised 
Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma,20 and an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) perfor-
mance status21 of 0 or 1. On July 30, 2014, the protocol 
was amended to include formal crossover of patients on 
the temsirolimus group to ibrutinib who have 
independent review committee-confi
 rmed progression 
of disease. Key exclusion criteria included chemotherapy, 
radiation, or other investigational drugs within 3 weeks, 
antibody treatment or immunoconjugates within 4 and 
10 weeks, respectively, and previous treatment with 
mTOR or Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors. All 
inclusion or exclusion criteria are shown in the 
appendix. The study was done according to the principles 
of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Guidelines for 
Good Clinical Practice. All patients provided written 
informed consent.
Randomisation and masking
Central randomisation was used. Patients were randomly 
assigned 
(1:1) 
to 
oral 
ibrutinib 
or 
intravenous 
temsirolimus based on a computer-generated random-
isation schedule. Randomisation was balanced by using 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed and other relevant literature databases for 
English-language articles published between Jan 1, 2005, and 
Aug 1, 2015, to identify drugs used to treat mantle-cell lymphoma, 
including trials that have been published specifi
 cally on ibrutinib or 
mantle-cell lymphoma and trials that have been published 
specifi
 cally on temsirolimus in mantle-cell lymphoma. We used the 
search terms “mantle cell lymphoma”, “ibrutinib”, and 
“temsirolimus”. Patients treated with ibrutinib have achieved high 
response rates and ongoing remissions in relapsed and refractory 
mantle-cell lymphoma, whereas temsirolimus has been shown to 
be superior to monochemotherapy in a randomised trial.
Added value of this study
Most of the patients in this study had advanced disease and 
progressive disease. Our fi
 ndings show additional benefi
 ts of 
ibrutinib over the only other therapy approved for relapsed 
mantle-cell lymphoma in the European Union. Based on this 
fi
 rst randomised trial of targeted therapies, ibrutinib is a 
standard targeted option for patients with relapsed or 
refractory mantle-cell lymphoma.
Implications of all the available evidence
We have proven that ibrutinib is active in patients with relapsed 
or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma who have had one or more 
previous rituximab therapy, and that it shows a signifi
 cant 
improvement in progression-free survival compared with an 
approved comparator, temsirolimus, along with a favourable 
tolerability profi
 le.

international 
prognostic index (sMIPI) score22 (low risk [0–3] vs 
intermediate risk [4–5] vs high risk [6–11]). The 
randomisation scheme was implemented within the 
interactive web response system that determined 
treatment assignment and matching study drug kits. 
Patients randomly assigned to study treatment were not 
replaced by another patient in case of discontinuation for 
any reason. Patients and investigators were unmasked to 
treatment assignment.
Procedures
Patients in the ibrutinib group received 560 mg orally 
once per day. Patients in the temsirolimus group received 
175 mg intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of the fi
 rst cycle, 
followed by 75 mg on days 1, 8, and 15 of each subsequent 
21-day cycle. Both groups continued treatment until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxic eff
 ects.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, 
which was defi
 ned as the interval from date of 
randomisation to the date of disease progression (as 
assessed by the independent review committee) or date of 
death, whichever occurred fi
 rst, irrespective of the use of 
subsequent antineoplastic therapy. Patients who were 
progression-free and alive were censored at the time of 
their last disease assessment, and patients who were alive 
with no post-baseline disease assessment were censored 
at randomisation. Complete response, partial response, 
and progressive disease were assessed by an independent 
review committee per revised Cheson criteria.20 Secondary 
endpoints included overall response rate (complete 
response and partial response), overall survival, 1-year 
survival rate, duration of response, time to next treatment, 
safety, prespecifi
 ed patient-reported outcomes, biomarkers 
and pharmacokinetics, and medical resource use rate.
Patient-reported outcomes were assessed using the 
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy—Lymphoma 
(FACT-Lym) questionnaire at baseline and until disease 
progression, death, or the clinical cutoff
 . Other 
malignancies and major bleeding events were defi
 ned as 
adverse events of special interest. Major bleeding was 
defi
 ned as any grade 3 or higher haemorrhage, any 
haemorrhage reported as a serious adverse event, and all 
grades of central nervous system haemorrhage.
Statistical analysis
About 280 patients (140 per treatment group) were to be 
randomised to observe 178 progression-free survival 
events. The study was designed to detect a hazard ratio 
(HR) of 0·64 for ibrutinib relative to temsirolimus 
(corresponding to a 57% improvement in median 
progression-free survival from 7 to 11 months under the 
exponential distribution assumption) with at least 85% 
power at a two-sided signifi
 cance level of 0·05. No 
interim analysis was planned.
The primary effi
  cacy analysis was done on the intention-
to-treat population (all patients randomly assigned to 
groups). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate 
the distribution of progression-free survival for each 
treatment group. The treatment eff
 ect of ibrutinib 
compared with temsirolimus based on progression-free 
survival was tested with a stratifi
 ed two-sided log-rank test 
stratifi
 ed by sMIPI and previous lines of therapy. The HR 
for ibrutinib relative to temsirolimus and its associated 
95% CI were calculated based on the stratifi
 ed Cox 
proportional hazards model by the stratifi
 cation factors at 
randomisation. All time-to-event endpoints, including 
overall survival, were analysed using the same methods as 
progression-free survival. Overall response rate was 
analysed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel χ² test 
adjusted for stratifi
 cation. For patient-related outcomes, 
the proportions of patients improving and declining were 
calculated, and median time to clinically meaningful 
improvement and time to worsening were estimated. 
Clinically meaningful improvement was defi
 ned as a 
5-point or greater increase from baseline, and worsening 
was defi
 ned as a 5-point or greater decrease from 
baseline.23–25 Safety was analysed in patients who received 
at least one dose of study drug. An independent data 
monitoring committee monitored safety on a periodic 
basis. SAS version 9.2 was used for all statistical analyses. 
The trial is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov

Results
280 patients were randomly assigned to ibrutinib (n=139) 
or temsirolimus (n=141; fi
 gure 1). Baseline demographics 
and disease characteristics (table 1) were generally well 
balanced and were consistent with known characteristics 
of mantle-cell lymphoma. Median age was 68 years 
(IQR 13), with 173 patients (62%) above 65 years. Most 
patients (208 [74%]) were male and most (232 [83%]) had 
stage IV disease. About two-thirds of the patients had 
intermediate-risk or high-risk disease according to sMIPI 
scores. Median number of previous lines of therapy was 
2 (IQR 2). The median duration of exposure was 
14∙4 months (IQR 15·1) for ibrutinib versus 3∙0 months 
(7·6) for temsirolimus, with a median relative dose 
intensity of 99∙9% for ibrutinib versus 81·8% for 
temsirolimus (appendix). At the clinical cutoff
 , more 
patients in the ibrutinib group were continuing treatment 
compared with the temsirolimus group (65 [47%] vs 
15 [11%]). Progressive disease was the most common 
reason for treatment discontinuation in both groups 
(ibrutinib, 55 [40%]; temsirolimus, 58 [41%]). Adverse 
events were reported as the primary reason of treatment 
discontinuation for nine patients (6%) in the ibrutinib 
group and 36 (26%) in the temsirolimus group (fi
 gure 1). 
The most common adverse event leading to discontinuation 
in the ibrutinib group was thrombo 
cytopenia in 
two patients, whereas the most common adverse events 
leading to discontinuation in the temsirolimus group were 
pneumonia, atypical pneumonia, or pneumonitis in 
fi
 ve patients. Based on the safety set, the number of 
patients with dose reductions due to adverse events was 
fi
 ve (4%) of 139 for ibrutinib versus 60 (43%) of 139 for 
temsirolimus. At the time of reporting, 65 (47%) of 
139 ibrutinib patients were still on treatment, compared 
with 15 (11%) of 141 temsirolimus patients. Additionally, 
more patients discontinued temsirolimus per investigator 
decision or patient refusal of treatment (ibrutinib, 4 [3%]; 
temsirolimus, 22 [16%]).
With a median follow-up of 20 months, ibrutinib 
treatment resulted in a 57% reduction in the risk of 
disease progression or death compared with temsirolimus 
(HR 0∙43 [95% CI 0∙32–0∙58]; p<0∙0001;  fi
 gures 2 and 3). 
The median progression-free survival was 14∙6 months 
(95% CI 10·4–not estimable) for the ibrutinib group and 
6∙2 months (4∙2–7∙9) for the temsirolimus group. At a 
2-year landmark, the progression-free survival rate is 41% 
in the ibrutinib group versus 7% in the temsirolimus 
group. The preplanned subgroup analysis showed 
internal consistency across almost all subgroups 
(fi
 gure 3). Patients with blastoid histology appeared to 
have derived no statistically signifi
 cant benefi
 t; however,

[95% CI 0∙32–0∙58]; appendix).
The overall response rate assessed by an independent 
review committee was signifi
 cantly higher for ibrutinib 
(72%, n=100) than for temsirolimus (40%, n=57) 
(diff
 erence 31∙5% [95% CI 20∙5–42∙5]; p<0∙0001), with 
a complete response reported in 26 (19%) patients versus 
two (1%) patients, respectively (odds ratio [OR] 3∙98 
[2∙38–6∙65]). Investigator-assessed overall response rate 
was also signifi
 cantly higher (p<0∙0001) for ibrutinib 
(77%, n=107) than for temsirolimus (46%, n=65) 
(diff
 erence 30∙9% [95% CI 20∙1–41∙7]; OR 4∙38 
[2∙53–7∙57]). Overall response rates were consistent 
with those assessed by the independent review 
committee. At time of clinical cutoff
 , median duration of 
response for the temsirolimus group was 7∙0 months 
(4∙2–9∙9 [IQR 10·9]) and median duration of response 
was not reached for ibrutinib; 59 (59%) of the 
100 responders in the ibrutinib group were continuing 
to respond. At 18 months, the estimated rate of duration 
of response was 58% (46–68) for ibrutinib and 20% 
(9–35) for temsirolimus (appendix).
After a median follow-up of 20∙0 months, 59 patients 
(42%) in the ibrutinib group and 63 (45%) in the 
temsirolimus group had died. Median overall survival 
was not reached for ibrutinib versus 21∙3 months for 
temsirolimus (HR 0∙76 [95% CI 0∙53–1∙09]; p=0∙1324; 
fi
 gure 2). This diff
 erence was not statistically signifi
 cant; 
however, it should be noted that 32 (23%) temsirolimus 
patients crossed over to ibrutinib. The 1-year survival 
rates were 68% for ibrutinib and 61% for temsirolimus.
A post hoc sensitivity analysis of overall survival was 
done in which data from patients in the temsirolimus 
group who crossed over to receive ibrutinib during the 
study or who had received ibrutinib as subsequent 
therapy were censored at the date of the fi
 rst dose of 
next-line ibrutinib treatment. The result was consistent 
with that recorded using the intention-to-treat analysis 
set  (data not shown).
Subsequent anticancer therapy was given to 82 (58%) 
patients in the temsirolimus group and 44 (32%) in 
the ibrutinib group. The most common subsequent 
treatments were rituximab (n=21, 15%), bendamustine 
(n=15, 11%), and cyclophosphamide (n=12, 9%) in the 
ibrutinib group and rituximab (n=36, 26%), ibrutinib 
(n=32, 23%), bendamustine (n=22, 16%), and cyclo-
phosphamide (n=19, 13%) in the temsirolimus group 
(appendix). Median time to next treatment was not 
reached with ibrutinib versus 11∙6 months with 
temsirolimus (p<0∙0001). Four patients who were 
assigned to the ibrutinib group received temsirolimus 
as subsequent therapy. After excluding patients who 
received crossover treatment with either drug, overall 
response rate on subsequent treatment was similar, 
with 20% response rate in both groups (ten of 50 patients 
in the temsirolimus group and eight of 40 patients in 
the ibrutinib group). More patients discontinued 
temsirolimus for adverse events, therefore potentially 
representing a less refractory population. The overall 
treatment 
eff
 ect 
might 
be 
better 
captured 
by 
progression-free survival 2 (defi
 ned as the time interval 
between the date of randomisation to the date of an 
event, where event is defi
 ned as progressive disease as 
assessed by the investigator after the next line of therapy, 
death from any cause, or start of subsequent therapy if 
no disease progression is noted26), which was longer for 
ibrutinib than for temsirolimus (HR 0·49 [95% CI 
0·36–0·69]; p<0·0001; appendix). Eff
 ective subsequent 
salvage treatment might have aff
 ected post-progression 
survival in the temsirolimus group.

A greater proportion of patients treated with ibrutinib 
had a clinically meaningful improvement in lymphoma 
symptoms versus those treated with temsirolimus 
(86 [62%] vs 50 [35%]). Improvement in symptoms 
occurred 
more 
quickly 
with 
ibrutinib 
versus 
temsirolimus, with a median time to clinically 
meaningful improvement of 6∙3 (IQR not estimable) 
weeks versus 57∙3 (101·4) weeks, respectively (p<0∙0001; 
fi
 gure 4). Similarly, a smaller proportion of patients 
treated 
with 
ibrutinib 
experienced 
a 
clinically 
meaningful worsening of lymphoma symptoms versus 
temsirolimus (37 [27%] vs 73 [52%]) and worsening of 
symptoms 
occurred 
later 
with 
ibrutinib 
versus 
temsirolimus (HR 0·27 [95% CI 0·18–0·41]; p<0∙0001; 
fi
 gure 4).
Median treatment duration was four times longer for 
the ibrutinib group (14·4 months [IQR 15·1]) compared 
with temsirolimus (3·0 months [7·6]). Despite the time 
diff
 erence in exposure between the treatment groups, 
overall frequencies of most cumulative treatment-
emergent adverse events were lower in the ibrutinib 
group relative to the temsirolimus group. Treatment-
emergent adverse events were reported in 138 (99%) 
patients in both treatment groups, with grade 3 or higher 
treatment-emergent adverse events reported in 94 (68%) 
patients in the ibrutinib group and 121 (87%) in the 
temsirolimus group. In the study, treatment-emergent 
adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation 
occurred in nine (6%) patients in the ibrutinib group and 
36 (26%) patients in the temsirolimus group. The most 
frequently reported (≥20% of patients) treatment-
emergent adverse events in the ibrutinib group were 
diarrhoea (n=40, 29%), cough (n=31, 22%), and fatigue 
(n=31, 22%). In the temsirolimus group these were 
 
thrombocytopenia (n=78, 56%), anaemia (n=60, 43%), 
diarrhoea (n=43, 31%), fatigue (n=40, 29%), neutropenia 
(n=36, 26%), epistaxis (n=33, 24%), cough (n=31, 22%), 
peripheral oedema (n=31, 22%), nausea (n=30, 22%), 
pyrexia (n=29, 21%), and stomatitis (n=29, 21%; table 2). 
As an adverse event of special clinical interest, grade 3 
or higher atrial fi
 brillation was reported in fi
 ve (4%) 
patients of the ibrutinib group and two (1%) of the 
temsirolimus group. Major bleeding was reported in 
14 (10%) patients in the ibrutinib group and in nine (6%) 
in the temsirolimus group. When adjusted for exposure, 
the event rate for any major bleeding treatment-emergent 
adverse event was 0·8 events per 100 patient-months for 
the ibrutinib group and 1·1 events per 100 patient-months 
for the temsirolimus group (appendix). New diagnoses of 
other malignancies were seen in fi
 ve (4%) patients in the 
ibrutinib group and four (3%) in the temsirolimus group. 
Most malignancies were non-melanomatous skin 
cancers. When adjusted for exposure, frequencies were 
similar in both treatment groups.
Death during treatment or within 30 days of the last 
dose of study drug was reported in 24 (17%) patients in 
the ibrutinib group and 15 (11%) in the temsirolimus 
group. The most common cause of death in this period 
was disease progression in the ibrutinib group, whereas 
in the temsirolimus group adverse events were most 
common. During the fi
 rst 6 months of treatment, 
eight (6%) patients in the ibrutinib group and 11 (8%) 
in the temsirolimus group had a treatment-emergent 
adverse event with an outcome of death.
Discussion
This is the fi
 rst randomised study comparing two of the 
targeted therapies approved for relapsed or refractory 
mantle-cell lymphoma, namely the Bruton’s tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor ibrutinib and the mTOR inhibitor 
temsirolimus. A statistically signifi
 cant advantage was 
shown for ibrutinib, with a median progression-free

survival of 14∙6 months for ibrutinib and 6∙2 months 
for temsirolimus. At 2 years, the progression-free 
survival rate is 41% in the ibrutinib group versus 7% in 
the temsirolimus group. Ibrutinib treatment also 
showed a signifi
 cant improvement in overall response 
rate and improvement in time to next treatment, and 
was better tolerated.
The improvement in progression-free survival with 
ibrutinib was robust and showed high concordance 
between independent review committee-assessed and 
investigator-assessed outcomes. The independent review 
committee-assessed HR was 0∙43 (95% CI 0∙32–0∙58; 
p<0·0001), with 184 independent review committee-
confi
 rmed progression-free survival events (ibrutinib 73, 
temsirolimus 
111). 
The 
investigator-assessed 
HR 
was also 0∙43 (95% CI 0∙32–0∙58; p<0·0001), with 
182 progression-free survival events (ibrutinib 73, 
temsirolimus 109). Progression-free survival was also 
consistent in the preplanned subgroup analysis for most 
subgroups, although the benefi
 t of ibrutinib was 
statistically not signifi
 cant in patients with blastoid 
histology. However, the number of patients with this 
histology was low across the treatment groups, and 
interpretation of these results should be made with 
caution. Thus, analysis of data pooled from various 
studies is required to allow a more reliable interpretation 
of the role for ibrutinib in the treatment of patients with 
blastoid histology.
The patient-reported outcome data support the 
favourable benefi
 t–risk data; ibrutinib was associated 
with greater and more rapid improvements, and also less 
worsening in lymphoma symptoms, as measured by the 
lymphoma subscale of the FACT-Lym. These results 
suggest that the superior effi
  cacy results and preferable 
tolerability of ibrutinib are accompanied by better patient-
reported lymphoma symptom responses, indicating 
signifi
 cant clinical benefi
 t for most patients with relapsed 
or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma.
Overall survival data showed a non-signifi
 cant 
tendency towards improvement, despite the crossover of 
32 (23%) patients from the temsirolimus group during 
the study. Subsequent treatments were required more 
frequently in the temsirolimus group than in the 
ibrutinib group. In fact, the crossover to an eff
 ective 
salvage treatment might have aff
 ected post-progression 
survival in the temsirolimus group. More patients died 
during treatment or within 30 days after the last ibrutinib 
dose, mostly due to disease progression. This is in light 
of the fact that more patients discontinued temsirolimus 
for adverse events after a median treatment duration of 
3 months. Moreover, fewer patients died due to a 
treatment-emergent adverse event in the ibrutinib group 
versus the temsirolimus group in the fi
 rst 6 months of 
treatment, and the number of treatment-emergent 
adverse events related to progressive disease in the 
ibrutinib group was low. Additionally, progression-free 
survival 2 results support the concept that the overall

benefi
 t of ibrutinib is not negatively compromised by 
subsequent treatment.
The results in our comparator group are consistent 
with the expected outcomes previously reported for 
temsirolimus, supporting the strength of this study. 
Witzig and colleagues17 enrolled 35 patients (with a 
median of three previous lines of therapy) into a phase 2 
study with a weekly dose of 250 mg for the treatment of 
relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma. The overall 
response rate was 38% with one (3%) complete response 
and 12 (35%) partial responses. Median overall survival 
was 12 months.17 Subsequently, a phase 2 study assessed a 
fl
 at dose of 25 mg weekly for the treatment of relapsed or 
refractory mantle-cell lymphoma.18 In this phase 2 study, 
29 patients were enrolled with a median of four previous 
lines of therapy. The overall response rate was 41% 
with one (4%) complete response and ten (37%) partial 
responses, and a median overall survival of 14 months. 
Direct comparisons between our study and these phase 2 
studies are restricted by the diff
 erent dosing regimens 
adopted. Temsirolimus was approved in the European 
Union for relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma 
on the basis of a phase 3 study of two diff
 erent doses of 
temsirolimus randomised against an investigator’s choice 
of a single drug therapy regimen.19 In the phase 3 study, 
which enrolled more heavily pretreated patients than the 
current study, the 175 mg and 75 mg dose of temsirolimus 
(equivalent to that used in this study) showed a median 
progression-free survival of 4∙8 months, an overall 
response rate of 22%, and a median overall survival of 
12∙8 months, which are inferior to those of the current 
study. However, the median progression-free survival for 
patients who received the 175 mg and 75 mg dosing in the 
phase 3 study increased to 7·4 months for patients who 
had fewer than three previous lines of therapy. Our 
median overall survival for patients randomised to 
temsirolimus was notably higher than seen in the 
previous studies. This fi
 nding could be the result of 
improvements in supportive care and the availability of 
new experimental drugs and treatment combinations for 
salvage therapy since the publication of the previous 
trials. Effi
  cacy outcomes for temsirolimus are consistent 
with the expected outcomes of patients treated with other 
drugs used for mantle-cell lymphoma such as bortezomib 
and lenalidomide (eg, overall response rates were 33% 
and 28% with a median progression-free survival of 
6·5 months and 4 months, respectively).27,28 The responses 
in the ibrutinib group of this study (progression-free 
survival 14·6 months, overall response rate 72%, complete 
response 19%) are consistent with previous phase 2 
studies. Ibrutinib was approved following a single-arm 
phase 1b/2 study13 that enrolled 111 patients at the same 
dose (560 mg orally daily) as our study. Progression-free 
survival (13·0 months), overall response rate (68%), and 
complete response rate (21%) were very similar to our 
results. Similarly, in a subsequent phase 2 study in 
patients with relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma 
who had progressed after two or more cycles of 
bortezomib therapy, an overall response rate of 63% and a 
complete response rate of 21% were reported.15
Analysis of the safety profi
 le of ibrutinib 560 mg per 
day in patients with previously treated mantle-cell 
lymphoma yielded fi
 ndings that were consistent with the 
known safety profi
 le of ibrutinib in other clinical settings. 
Whereas the frequency of all-grade treatment-emergent 
adverse events and serious adverse events was similar 
between treatment groups, the toxicity profi
 le is 
especially in favour of ibrutinib when adjusted for 
exposure. Despite a median treatment duration four 
times higher for ibrutinib, grade 3 or higher adverse 
events and drug-related serious adverse events were 
reported more frequently in the temsirolimus group.
Although this was an open-label study, we do not 
believe this study design introduced bias. The primary 
endpoint was assessed by an independent review 
committee that was masked to study treatment. Patients 
who discontinued study therapy for reasons other than 
progressive disease (such as an adverse event) were not 
censored at start of subsequent treatment. Thus, the 
eff
 ect of the unmasked nature of this study on the 
assessment of the primary endpoint was minimised. 
We cannot exclude the possibility that the investigators 
might have been aff
 ected by the study group when 
reporting adverse events. However, given the improve-
ment in toxicity profi
 le seen for ibrutinib, we do not 
believe this potential bias could be responsible for our 
safety conclusions.
The results of this phase 3 trial confi
 rm the effi
  cacy and 
favourable safety profi
 le of ibrutinib as shown in previous 
phase 2 studies. It also confi
 rms the positive benefi
 t–risk 
ratio for ibrutinib as an eff
 ective targeted approach in 
relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma. The 
demographic characteristics at baseline were refl
 ective of 
the target patient population, supporting the application 
of these results to the general mantle-cell lymphoma 
population. Long-term follow-up will be reported at study 
conclusion (the end of the study will occur when 80% of 
the randomly assigned patients have died, or 3 years after 
the last patient is assigned to treatment, or the funder 
terminates the study, whichever comes fi
 rst). Future 
research should investigate ibrutinib-based combination 
approaches for patients with relapsed or refractory 
mantle-cell lymphoma and in front-line therapy.29
