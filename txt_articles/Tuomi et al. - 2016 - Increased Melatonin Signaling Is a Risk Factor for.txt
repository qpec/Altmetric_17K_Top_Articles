In Brief
Tuomi et al. show that a common (about
30%) human type 2 diabetes risk variant
of the melatonin receptor 1B gene affects
insulin release. A recall-by-genotype
study demonstrated that melatonin
treatment inhibits insulin secretion, with
at-risk carriers exhibiting higher glucose
levels. Melatonin might have a protective
role in preventing nocturnal
hypoglycemia.

SUMMARY
Type
2
diabetes
(T2D)
is
a
global
pandemic.
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have
identified >100 genetic variants associated with the
disease, including a common variant in the melatonin
receptor 1 b gene (MTNR1B). Here, we demonstrate
increased MTNR1B expression in human islets from
risk G-allele carriers, which likely leads to a reduction
in insulin release, increasing T2D risk. Accordingly,
in insulin-secreting cells, melatonin reduced cAMP
levels, and MTNR1B overexpression exaggerated
the inhibition of insulin release exerted by melatonin.
Conversely, mice with a disruption of the receptor
secreted more insulin. Melatonin treatment in a hu-
man recall-by-genotype study reduced insulin secre-
tion and raised glucose levels more extensively in
risk G-allele carriers. Thus, our data support a model
where enhanced melatonin signaling in islets re-
duces insulin secretion, leading to hyperglycemia
and greater future risk of T2D. The findings also
imply that melatonin physiologically serves to inhibit
nocturnal insulin release.
INTRODUCTION
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global disorder rapidly increasing in
prevalence. It is projected to afflict 350 million people in 2030
(Shaw et al., 2010). The burden on society as well as the af-
flicted individual is tremendous. The disease is of multifactorial
origin: environmental factors, associated with a modern lifestyle
(obesity, physical inactivity, increased age), trigger the disease
in genetically susceptible individuals (Prasad and Groop, 2015).
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified
>100 genetic variants associated with the disease (Prasad
and Groop, 2015; Visscher et al., 2012), including a common
variant (�30% of the population) in the melatonin receptor
1 b gene (MTNR1B) (Bouatia-Naji et al., 2009; Lyssenko
et al., 2009; Prokopenko et al., 2009). The mechanisms, how-
ever, by which melatonin affects glucose metabolism and the
development of T2D remain largely unknown. Notably, the
SNP rs10830963 in the MTNR1B gene showed a stronger
association with glucose levels in nondiabetic individuals than
with risk of future T2D (Lyssenko et al., 2009). Although the ma-
jority of the identified genes points to failure of pancreatic
b cells to release insulin as being the main culprit in the patho-
genesis of the disease, the underlying molecular mechanisms
have remained largely unresolved for most genes identified
by GWAS (Torres et al., 2013). Moreover, information about
these genetic risk variants has not yet been translated into
the clinical setting, where improved preventive and diagnostic
tools are urgently needed (Lyssenko et al., 2008). It is becoming
increasingly clear that treatment of metabolic diseases is not
equally efficacious in all individuals (Anderson et al., 2012).
One means of meeting these challenges is individualized treat-
ment. Here, improved understanding of pathogenetic pro-
cesses is required to allow tailored treatment on an individual
basis. Understanding the impact of genotype, which reflects
or even underlies such processes, is one way to reach this

 goal, but studies proving this concept are only now starting to
emerge (Tang et al., 2014).
Melatonin is a hormone produced predominantly in the pineal
gland (Mulder et al., 2009). Its release is triggered by loss of light
exposure to the retina. Hence, melatonin indicates the time of
day, or ambient light, to various organs and tissues in the
body—it is hereby a ‘‘Zeitgeber,’’ entraining circadian rhythm.
Indeed, control of circadian rhythm at several levels, including
the pancreatic b cell (Marcheva et al., 2010), has been implicated
in normal metabolic control, as well as the development of T2D
(Marcheva et al., 2009; Peschke et al., 2015). The hormone sig-
nals at the cellular level through two receptors: 1A and 1B (MT1
and MT2 in the mouse) (von Gall et al., 2002). Both receptors
mainly act via interfering with the formation of cAMP through
inhibitory G proteins (Gi), but also other signaling pathways are
employed (Mulder et al., 2009; von Gall et al., 2002). The pleio-
tropism at the level of both receptor and second messenger
probably explains why the reported effects on insulin release
have not yielded a clear understanding of the regulatory role of
melatonin in insulin release (Mulder et al., 2009). Thus, both
inhibitory and stimulatory effects of melatonin on insulin secre-
tion have been reported (Kemp et al., 2002; Peschke et al., 2006).
Against this background, it is intriguing that we and others
have found that a variant of the MTNR1B gene is associated
with elevated plasma glucose levels, a reduction of the early in-
sulin response to both oral and intravenous glucose, a faster
deterioration of insulin secretion over time, and increased future
risk of T2D (Bouatia-Naji et al., 2009; Lyssenko et al., 2009; Pro-
kopenko et al., 2009). This association has subsequently been
confirmed in other populations (Jonsson et al., 2013; Renstro
¨ m
et al., 2015; Ro
¨ nn et al., 2009). Despite the very robust ge-
netic association, a molecular understanding of why melatonin
signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of T2D has still not
been reached. To resolve this issue, we performed experimental
studies in human islets, INS-1 832/13 b cells, and mice, as well
as clinical studies in humans. We show that the rs10830963
risk variant of MTNR1B is an expression quantitative trait locus
(eQTL) conferring increased expression of MTNR1B mRNA in
human islets. Experiments in INS-1 832/13 b cells and Mt2
knockout mice (Mt2�/�) establish that melatonin signaling results
in inhibition of insulin release. Translation to humans in a recall-
by-genotype study demonstrates that melatonin treatment in-
hibits insulin secretion in all subjects, but carriers of the risk
variant are more sensitive to this inhibitory effect of melatonin.
Together, these observations support a model in which a genet-
ically determined increase in melatonin signaling underlies
impaired insulin secretion, a pathogenetic hallmark of T2D.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
rs10830963 Is an eQTL for MTNR1B in Human Islets
We have previously reported that mRNA levels of MTNR1B are
increased in isolated islets from a small group of older donors
(n = 25; age >45 years) carrying the rs10830963 risk variant
(Lyssenko et al., 2009). To establish that the risk allele is indeed
an eQTL, we quantified MTNR1B mRNA in relation to the
rs10830963 SNP in islets from 204 donors of Scandinavian
descent, using RNA sequencing. Carriers of one or two risk al-
leles exhibited a 2- and 4-fold increase in MTNR1B mRNA
expression compared with carriers of two copies of the non-
risk allele (Figure 1A). Expression of MTNR1A was not affected
by either of these genotypes. The rs10830963/MTNR1B eQTL
has not been reported in brain, which exhibits the highest level
of MTNR1B expression, nor in any other tissue, and thus seems
to be specific for human pancreatic islets. Accumulating data
thereby establish MTNR1B as one of the strongest eQTLs in
human islets (Fadista et al., 2014; Lyssenko et al., 2009).
A recent study suggests a plausible molecular mechanism
for the upregulation of MTNR1B in islets in risk allele carriers
(Gaulton et al., 2015). FOXA2 binding motifs found by chromatin
immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and used to iden-
tify causal genetic variants for susceptibility to T2D, are enriched
at the MTNR1B locus. This is thought to enable binding of FOXA2
and/or other transcription factors. Subsequent studies revealed
that rs10830963 preferentially binds the transcription factor
NEUROD1 in EndoC-bH1 cells, a cell line derived from fetal hu-
man b cells (Andersson et al., 2015; Ravassard et al., 2011). In
fact, the MTNR1B risk G-allele creates a NEUROD1 consensus
binding site. Accordingly, the region surrounding rs10830963,
and comprising the G-allele, shows increased enhancer activ-
ity in EndoC-bH1 cells. Whether this mechanism mediates
increased expression of MTNR1B also in primary islet cells re-
mains to be shown.
The effects of melatonin are mediated by two homologous, but
distinct, receptors, which are expressed in a cell-specific fashion
in mice and humans (Nagorny et al., 2011; Ramracheya et al.,
2008; von Gall et al., 2002). Here, we focused on MTNR1B/
Mt2 because it harbors the rs10830963 risk variant, mapping
to its single 11.5 kb intron. However, some data suggest that
MT1 is the predominant receptor for melatonin signaling under
normal conditions in INS-1 832/13 b cells and mouse islets
(Mu
¨ hlbauer et al., 2012). In mouse, we have demonstrated that
MT1 receptors are mainly expressed in the glucagon-producing
a cell (Nagorny et al., 2011), whereas MT2 receptors are mainly
found in b cells (Lyssenko et al., 2009; Nagorny et al., 2011).
Indeed, these results confirmed a previous study, which identi-
fied MTNR1A mRNA in human a cells (Ramracheya et al.,
2008). Here, it was further found that melatonin increases
glucagon secretion from dispersed human islet cells, and poten-
tially insulin secretion via an indirect effect mediated by glucagon
on the b cell (Ramracheya et al., 2008). Very recently, RNA
sequencing of purified adult human islet cells revealed that
MTNR1B is expressed several-fold higher than MTNR1A both
in a and b cells; expression of MTNR1B is similar in a and b cells
(Blodgett et al., 2015).
Increased Expression of MTNR1B in Insulin-Secreting
INS-1 832/13 b Cells
Having confirmed that the rs10830963 MTNR1B risk variant
conferred increased expression of receptor mRNA in human is-
lets, we continued to investigate whether this results in a gain of
function. To this end, we overexpressed the receptor in clonal in-
sulin-secreting cells (INS-1 832/13), using a recombinant adeno-
virus driving expression of MTNR1B by the rat insulin promoter 2
(Rip2). Given that MTNR1B/Mt2 expression constitutively is low
in b cells, Adv-Rip2-MTNR1B conferred a robust increase in re-
ceptor mRNA (see Figure S1A available online). Insulin release in
response to 16.7 mM glucose during a 1 hr incubation of these
1068

 cells was unaffected by MTNR1B overexpression (Figure 1B).
However, addition of 100 nM melatonin
reduced insulin
release from MTNR1B-overexpressing cells more extensively
than from control cells.
The melatonin receptors inhibit adenylate cyclase activity via
a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gi protein, with a consequent
decrease in cAMP production (Mulder et al., 2009). Therefore,
the effect of melatonin on intracellular cAMP levels was investi-
gated in single insulin-secreting cells expressing a fluorescent
cAMP reporter (Dyachok et al., 2006). An increase in the glucose
concentration from 2.8 to 16.7 mM robustly induced a rise of
cAMP, which was reversibly suppressed by melatonin (Fig-
ure 1C). Moreover, MTNR1B overexpression slightly, but not
significantly, blunted the initial glucose response (Figure 1D)
but significantly increased the fraction of melatonin-responsive
cells and effect of the hormone (Figures 1E and 1F). Conversely,
addition of PTX, blocking signaling from the MTNR1B receptor,
prevented the inhibitory effect of melatonin on insulin release in
control as well as in MTNR1B-overexpressing cells (Figure 1B).
Thus, melatonin inhibited insulin release via reduced formation
of cAMP, and this was accentuated by MTNR1B overexpression.
In Vivo Glucose Metabolism in Melatonin Receptor 1B/
Mt2 Knockout Mice
To further understand the role of melatonin signaling for meta-
bolic control, we examined glucose metabolism in mice with a
genetic ablation of Mt2, the murine equivalent of MTNR1B in
humans (von Gall et al., 2002). Mt2�/� mice fed normal chow
diet gradually became heavier than wild-type (WT) control
mice (Figures S2A and S2B). An intravenous glucose tolerance
test (IVGTT; Figures 2A and 2B; Figures S2C–S2E) revealed
increased insulin secretion during the challenge. This exagger-
ated response to glucose was more robust in female than in
male mice (Figures S2F–S2H). Despite elevated insulin levels,
plasma glucose levels and glucose elimination rates (Kg) in
Mt2�/� mice remained unchanged (Figure 2C).

 Increased levels of circulating insulin in the face of unaltered
plasma glucose levels imply decreased systemic insulin sensi-
tivity, but insulin tolerance was similar in Mt2�/� and WT mice
(Figure 2D). To further dissect glucose homeostasis in Mt2�/�
mice, we performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycaemic clamps.
While neither basal whole-body glucose turnover (Ra) nor clamp
whole-body glucose turnover (Rd) differed between the strains,
the glucose infusion rate (GIR) was significantly lower in
Mt2�/� mice during the clamp (Figure 2E). The hepatic glucose
production (HGP) during the clamp was virtually abolished in
WT mice, while the Mt2�/� mice failed to inhibit endogenous
hepatic glucose production to the same extent (Figure 2E; Fig-
ure S3A). Since the rate of glucose uptake is the sum of GIR
and residual HGP during the clamp, impaired suppression of
hepatic glucose output most likely explained the normal Rd in
Mt2�/� mice.
Together with moderately reduced glucose uptake in liver (Fig-
ure 2F), these findings suggest impaired insulin sensitivity at the
level of the liver. Glucose uptake in muscle trended toward
a decrease, while that in fat remained unaltered (Figure 2F).
Collectively, these data suggest that the liver of Mt2�/� mice ac-
counted for the reduction in insulin sensitivity. Increased hepatic
glucose production in Mt2�/� mice is presumably an adaptive
change, which evolved to maintain euglycaemia in the face
of enhanced insulin release. However, we could not find any
clear explanation for increased hepatic glucose production in
Mt2�/� mice since glycogen synthesis and glycolytic rate re-
mained unchanged in liver, fat, and skeletal muscle (Figures
S3B and S3C).
With respect to basal whole-body metabolism in Mt2�/� mice,
our data agree with those published previously, i.e., no differ-
ences in circulating plasma glucose or insulin levels (Bazwin-
sky-Wutschke et al., 2014). To the best of our knowledge, no
glucose tolerance tests or clamp studies in melatonin receptor
knockout mice have been reported.

To further clarify why insulin secretion in vivo is exaggerated in
the Mt2�/� mice, we examined b cell mass. Mt2�/� mice

 displayed greater b cell mass compared to WT mice (Figure 3A).
The increased b cell mass was due to an increase in number of
islets but not in mean islet size (Figures 3B and 3C). Accordingly,
insulin content was similar in Mt2�/� and WT islets (Figure 3D).
Next, we examined insulin secretion from Mt2�/� islets. Here,
Mt2�/� islets displayed an accentuated secretory response
compared with WT islets: in Mt2�/� islets, stimulated secretion
at 16.7 mM glucose increased 6-fold over basal versus 4-fold
in WT islets (Figure 3E). This could be explained by increased
levels of cAMP, mediated by the loss of melatonin signaling,
which normally would lower the second messenger level in
b cells. Indeed, we observed higher levels of basal cAMP in
Mt2�/� islets (Figure 3F). Moreover, online recordings with the
fluorescent cAMP reporter revealed a more pronounced initial
glucose-induced cAMP elevation in islet cells from Mt2�/�
mice (Figure 3G). A closer analysis of these data in Mt2�/� islets
showed that the time to half-maximal rise in cAMP level was
significantly decreased and the amplitude of the cAMP elevation
increased (Figures 3H and 3I). Together, these data show that
insulin secretion in Mt2�/� islets was enhanced. This can be

 explained by an increased secretory response and greater b cell
mass. The former can be attributed to raised cAMP levels due to
the lost inhibitory effect of melatonin (Mulder et al., 2009).
Data from us and others thus suggest that MTNR1B signaling
serves to inhibit insulin secretion and, hereby, influences gly-
caemic control. Here, this is based on in vitro and in vivo
studies in cells, mice, and humans: overexpression of MTNR1B
in insulin-secreting cells accentuated a reduction in insulin
release in the presence of melatonin, and, conversely, inactiva-
tion of the receptor in mice resulted in enhanced insulin secre-
tion, i.e., the reverse phenotype, or loss of function (mice) as
opposed to gain of function (b cells and humans). The receptor
most likely mediated its effect via a reduction of cAMP, an
important potentiator of insulin secretion (Mulder et al., 2009).
This is based on the notion that during single-cell, real-time
recordings of cAMP, melatonin reduced cAMP in b cells and
that PTX (Gi protein-inhibitor) reversed the inhibitory effect of
melatonin on insulin release in MTNR1B-overexpressing cells
and, finally, that basal cAMP levels were raised in islets from
Mt2�/� mice.
Knockout mice for melatonin receptors have previously been
studied with mixed results. Isolated islets from Mt1�/� mice as
well as double knockout mice for Mt1 and Mt 2 lose the inhibitory
effect of melatonin on insulin secretion (Mu
¨ hlbauer et al., 2012).
In Mt2�/� mice, there is a 40% nonsignificant reduction in insulin
release upon addition of melatonin. If there would be an inhibi-
tory effect of melatonin on insulin secretion in Mt2�/� mice, it
could be mediated via remaining Mt1 receptors in islets. How-
ever, these results are hard to interpret because the authors
studied 6 hr incubations of islets at 8.6 mM in full medium con-
taining other potential secretagogues. Therefore, it may be diffi-
cult to distinguish between an acute and a more chronic effect of
melatonin on islets and whether stimulation is specific for any
given fuel.
The specific impact of melatonin signaling on b cell function
has previously been studied in INS-1 cells stably transfected
with MTNR1B (Mu
¨ hlbauer et al., 2011). This manipulation led to
dose-dependent exaggeration of an inhibitory effect of mela-
tonin on insulin secretion, which is PTX sensitive, and mediated
by decreases in whole-cell cAMP. Interpretation of the results is,
however, confounded by the fact that only one clone has been
studied, that data represent a chronic situation where signaling
from MTNR1B is exaggerated, and that incubations of cells
have largely been for 6 hr. Here, we have created depth to the
understanding by using a single-cell approach in both clonal
and primary cells. Imaging of the responses in cellular cAMP
levels have mapped out how b cells and islets respond to mela-
tonin in terms of cAMP.
Recall-by-Genotype of Carriers of the MTNR1B Risk
Variant
If the trait conferred by rs10830963 is indeed a gain of function,
as suggested by our in vitro and mouse in vivo data, then acti-
vation of the system in vivo in humans would lead to a reduction
of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. To test this hypothesis,
23 nondiabetic individuals with two copies of the risk allele (GG)
and 22 carriers of two copies of the nonrisk allele (CC) were
administered 4 mg of melatonin at bedtime for 3 months. There
were no differences in age, gender, body mass index, or family
history of diabetes (see ‘‘Melatonin Intervention Trial’’ in Supple-
mental Information). During an oral glucose tolerance test
(OGTT), preceding administration of melatonin, glucose con-
centrations were higher and the first-phase insulin response
lower in GG versus CC genotype carriers (Figures 4A and 4C;
Table 1), confirming our previous results (Lyssenko et al.,
2009). Insulin secretion adjusted for insulin sensitivity (disposi-
tion index; DI) was three times higher in CC than in GG carriers
(Table 1).
After 3 months of melatonin treatment, there was a clear
decrease in first-phase insulin release and an increase in
glucose concentrations in all subjects (Figure S4; Table S1).
This was particularly clear in GG carriers (Figures 4B and 4D;
Table 1), despite identical dosage of melatonin and similar
plasma melatonin concentrations in GG and CC carriers.
When compared with baseline data, measures of insulin secre-
tion were lower in the GG carriers after melatonin treatment (Fig-
ures 4E and 4F; Table 1), particularly the corrected insulin
response (CIR) during the first 30 min of the OGTT (p = 0.008;
Figure 4E). Notably, insulin sensitivity increased after melatonin
treatment regardless of genotype (Figure 4F; Table 1; Table S1).
In fact, an increased insulin sensitivity could also contribute
to the lowering of insulin secretion in GG carriers, since the
insulin sensitivity index (ISI) increased significantly (p = 0.02).
In CC carriers, ISI remained unchanged (Table 1). However,
there was tendency for reduction in DI, but this did not reach
statistical significance. Thus, the MTNR1B variant is unusual
when it comes to its effect on insulin secretion and action, which
both are lower in GG than in CC carriers (Jonsson et al., 2013). In
contrast, the metabolic consequences of melatonin treatment in
CC carriers were modest, restricted to fasting plasma glucose
levels and CIR (Figure 4; Table 1). Thus, the quantitative effect
of melatonin on insulin release was inhibitory and genotype
specific.
The acute effects of melatonin on glucose tolerance in young
healthy female athletes were recently reported (Garaulet et al.,
2015). The subjects were divided into two groups with respect
to the rs10830963 GC and CC genotypes in MTNR1B. Despite
the low number of only heterozygous carriers of the risk G-allele
(we examined homozygous GG-carriers), melatonin had a signif-
icant negative effect on glucose clearance during a 2 hr OGTT in
the morning, but not in the night. There were no effects on basal
melatonin levels or insulin levels during the challenge. Thus, both
studies confirm that melatonin exerts effects on glucose meta-
bolism in a genotype-specific fashion, which is evident in the
morning, acutely and chronically.
Sleep Duration and Quality in Carriers of the MTNR1B
Risk Variant
Melatonin is widely available over the counter and/or as a pre-
scription drug for use as a sleep agent and in prevention of jet
lag. We therefore examined whether the rs10830963 genotype
affected sleep duration and quality. Although GG carriers re-
ported slightly poorer sleep quality before melatonin treatment
(Table 1), there was no difference between the GG and CC ge-
notype carriers (Table 1) with respect to reported or recorded
sleep quality in response to melatonin. In fact, sleep quality
improved with melatonin treatment irrespective of rs10830963
genotype (Table S1), and, thus, altered sleep cannot account
1072
Cell Metabolism 23, 1067–1077, June 14, 2016
 for the exaggerated effect of melatonin on insulin secretion in
GG-carriers.
Given that the risk allele is very common in the population
(about 30%) (Lyssenko et al., 2009), a widespread use of mela-
tonin as sleep agent and in prevention of jet lag could potentially
be more harmful than previously thought, particularly in carriers
of the MTNR1B risk variant. In addition, there is concern that
risk allele carriers may also be less suitable for nocturnal shift
work, given that melatonin secretion is elevated in this group of
workers, where metabolic disorders are more prevalent (Scheer
et al., 2009). At this point our studies with respect to sleep do not
support such concerns, although further study is clearly war-
ranted. Also, genotype-specific impact of shift work would be
very interesting to examine.
Concluding Remarks
The role of melatonin in control of whole-body metabolism and in-
sulin release has been controversial (Mulder et al., 2009). While
mostpreviousstudieshavesuggestedaninhibitoryeffectofmela-
tonin on insulin release (Peschke et al., 2006), some studies have
also shown stimulatory effects (Kemp et al., 2002; Ramracheya
et al., 2008). Moreover, both improved and impaired glucose

Melatonin treatment impairs glucose metabolism more in carriers of the MTNR1B rs10830963 risk variant (GG; n = 23) than in nonrisk carriers (CC; n = 22) during

 tolerance has been reported after melatonin therapy (Rubio-
Sastre et al., 2014; Teodoro et al., 2014). The use of different spe-
cies and experimental models may be a reason for these discrep-
ancies. Another explanation could be that most human studies
have not taken into account the genetic background of the study
participants, and time of day for experiments has not been stan-
dardized. Here, using an array of experimental approaches in vivo
and in vitro as well as clinical studies in humans, we arrived at the
conclusion that the physiological role of melatonin in islets is to
inhibit insulin release, most likely via a reduction in cAMP levels.
A melatonin-mediated reduction in nocturnal insulin release,
when melatonin levels are high but metabolic demands low, due
to cessation of food intake, is perhaps a physiological and protec-
tive mechanism against nocturnal hypoglycemia.
Our group has previously reported that negative effects on
both insulin secretion and sensitivity underlie the perturbations
in glucose metabolism in carriers of rs10830963 G risk variant
in MTNR1B (Jonsson et al., 2013). The human studies in this
report translated the experimental findings into everyday life of
the many people administering melatonin for sleep disorders or
to prevent jet lag. While melatonin impaired insulin secretion in
all carriers, this was more pronounced in homozygous carriers
of the GG risk genotype. Moreover, the ratio of secretion of insu-
lin to that of glucagon was reduced (Table 1), enabling opposite
effects of these glucose-lowering (insulin) and glucose-raising
(glucagon) hormones. The implications of these findings need
to be further explored.
Worthy of note, our study is one of the first pharmacogenetic
studies in the field of T2D, employing a recall-by-genotype
design (Tang et al., 2014). It demonstrated that the effect of
melatonin on glucose metabolism is dependent upon genotype.
Although yet to be proven, carriers of the MTNR1B risk variant
are likely to have lower cAMP levels in pancreatic b cells. In
view of this, incretin-based therapy, which amplifies cAMP
signaling in b cells, may be particularly well suited for these
patients.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Expression of MTNR1B mRNA was examined by RNA sequencing, using Illu-
mina HiSeq 2000, as previously described (Fadista et al., 2014). We analyzed
MTNR1B expression in 204 batches of human islets from donors provided by
the Nordic Center for Clinical Islet Transplantation in Uppsala, Sweden. The
islets were cultured as previously described for 1–9 days prior to analysis
(Fadista et al., 2014; Lyssenko et al., 2009).
Cell Culture and Adenovirus Transduction
Clonal insulin-secreting INS-1 832/13 b cells were cultured as previously
described (Hohmeier et al., 2000). The cells were transduced with E1-deleted,
replication-deficient adenovirus containing human MTNR1B cDNA under the
control of the rat insulin promoter-2 (Ad-Rip2-MTNR1B) or an adenovirus con-
taining green fluorescent protein (Ad-Rip2-GFP). For assay of insulin secretion,
INS-1 832/13 b cells transduced with the respective adenoviruses were
cultured for 48 hr followed by 1 hr static incubation with the indicated secreta-
gogue. Insulin was measured by Coat-A-Count insulin radioimmunoassay
(DPC, Los Angeles, CA).
Mt2 Knockout Mice
Melatonin receptor Mtnr1b knockout (Mt2�/�) and WT mice were kindly
provided by Professor David R. Weaver (University of Massachusetts Medical
School, Worcester, MA, USA). The targeted deletion of the receptor to

 generate Mt2�/� mice has been described previously (Jin et al., 2003). Mt2�/�
mice carry a disrupted exon 1, resulting in expression of a nonfunctional recep-
tor unable to bind melatonin.
Glucose and Insulin Tolerance Tests in Mice
Tolerance tests and clamps were performed in sedated mice. For IVGTT, mice
were fasted for 10 hr followed by 1 g/kg glucose injections into a tail vein. For
ITT, mice were fasted for 4 hr and given 0.75 mU/g intraperitoneal human in-
sulin injections (Novo Nordisk, Clayton, NC). Hyperinsulinemic-euglycaemic
clamps were performed as previously described (Kim et al., 2001).
Islet Isolation and Batch Incubation
Islets were as described previously (Fex et al., 2007) and handpicked under a
stereomicroscope. Batches of four islets were incubated for 1 hr in KRBB
buffer containing either 1 or 15 mM glucose. Aliquots of incubation medium
were collected for measurement of insulin with ELISA (Insulin mouse ELISA;
Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). Insulin from islets was extracted in acid ethanol
at 4�C.
b Cell Mass
Pancreata were dissected in a standardized fashion, weighed, frozen on
dry ice, and consecutive 10 mm thick sections cut. Insulin-immunostained
area and total section area were measured in all islets in nine sections from
three parts of the pancreas. b cell mass was calculated by multiplying area
of insulin-positive cells/total pancreatic area with pancreatic weight. Islet
number and mean islet size were also calculated on insulin-immunostained
sections.
Analyses of cAMP
cAMP was extracted from frozen islets in an ethanol/dry ice bath and deter-
mined by cAMP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. cAMP was also
measured in single living cells and intact pancreatic islets, using evanescent
wave microscopy and a fluorescent translocation reporter as previously
described (Dyachok et al., 2006; Tian et al., 2011).
Melatonin Intervention Trial
Participants from the population-based PPP-Botnia Study (Isomaa et al.,
2010; Lyssenko et al., 2009), who had two copies of the rs10830963 risk allele
(GG, n = 240), were matched with carriers of the WT allele (CC, n = 1059) for
gender, age ±3 years, BMI ±1–2 kg/m2, and glucose tolerance. Exclusion
criteria were diabetes, pregnancy, poorly treated hypertension, glaucoma,
coronary heart disease, arrhythmias, ulcer, panic attacks, psychosis, use of
sleeping pills, beta or alpha blockers, antidepressive or antipsychotic medica-
tion, and abnormal creatinine or liver enzymes. A total of 23 GG and 22 CC
carriers were recruited for the study, where they received 4 mg of melatonin
(Circadin, Oy Leiras Finland Ab) once daily in the evening for 3 months. Before
and after 3 months they underwent a 75 g OGTT with measurements of plasma
glucose and serum insulin at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min, and plasma glucagon and
serum melatonin at 0 min. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated by HOMA, and the
ISI was calculated from the OGTT data. b cell function was assessed as the
corrected insulin response (CIR) during the OGTT (Hanson et al., 2000), or
a disposition index (DI = ISI 3 CIR) (Bergman et al., 2002; Matsuda and
DeFronzo, 1999).
Sleep Quantity and Quality
Sleep was measured with actigraphs worn on the wrist for an average of 8
nights before the melatonin treatment and on average 7 nights before the sec-
ond OGTT (Table S1). All participants provided completed sleep logs,
including written sleep logs and electronic event markers of the bedtimes
and waking times. Data were scored with Actiwatch Activity & Sleep Analysis
version 7.38 software.
Statistical Analysis
Values were expressed as mean ± SEM or median and interquartile range. Sta-
tistical differences between means were assessed by Mann-Whitney U test,
Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, or two-way ANOVA with Bonfer-
roni’s multiple comparison tests as indicated in the figure legends. The chi-
square test was used to compare percentages of cells. In human data,
Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank tests were
used. Nominal p values without correction for multiple testing are shown.
