Abstract
The overwhelming amount of genetic alterations identified through cancer genome sequencing 
requires complementary approaches to interpret their significance and interactions. We developed 
a novel whole-body insertional mutagenesis screen in mice, designed for the discovery of Pten-
cooperating tumor suppressors, in which mobilization of a single-copy inactivating Sleeping 
Beauty transposon is coupled to Pten disruption within the same genome. The analysis of 278 
transposition-induced prostate, breast and skin tumors detected tissue-specific and shared datasets 
of known and candidate cancer genes. We validated ZBTB20, CELF2, PARD3, AKAP13 and 
WAC, identified by our screens in multiple cancer types, as new tumor suppressors in prostate 
cancer: we demonstrated their synergy with PTEN for preventing invasion in vitro and confirmed 
their clinical relevance. Further characterization of Wac in vivo revealed obligate 
haploinsufficiency for this autophagy-regulating gene in a Pten-deficient context. Our study 
identifies complex PTEN-cooperating tumor suppressor networks in different cancer types with 
potential clinical implications.
Introduction
Although cancer genome sequencing has revealed multiple genetic modifications underlying 
the carcinogenic process1, its ability to pinpoint players altered by non-genetic mechanisms 
is limited and discerning between driver and passenger alterations still represents a major 
challenge. Moreover, such strategy is not designed to elucidate cooperation between 
multiple driver genes. Indeed, some genes previously thought to be passengers are now 
believed to cooperate with other cancer genes and thus become drivers2.
Insertional mutagenesis in mice is a valuable method for genome-wide functional studies. 
Transposon-based somatic screens have identified new genes involved in the pathogenesis of 
different cancer types. Transposon mobilization in mice with known cancer-predisposing 
mutations has also uncovered synergistic mechanisms between networks driving cancer 
progression3–13. Here, we have enhanced the capabilities of transposon-based insertional 
mutagenesis to identify cooperating cancer driver events, developing a system that allows 
disruption of a known targeted gene and single-copy transposon mobilization to occur 
simultaneously in the same cell. Using this strategy, we performed a mutagenesis screen in 
mice aimed at identifying loss-of-function alterations cooperating with the inactivation of 
Pten, a tumor suppressor commonly deleted/mutated in cancer. In parallel, for comparison 
with a more conventional setting, we generated another cohort of mice harbouring an 
additional concatemer of inactivating transposons.
A single transposon was sufficient to cause cancer in cooperation with Pten loss. The 
analysis of prostate, breast and skin tumors from these mice allowed the identification of 
large numbers of Pten-cooperating tumor suppressor candidate genes. Focusing on the 
prostate, we confirmed the functional and clinical relevance of 5 of these candidates 
(ZBTB20, CELF2, PARD3, AKAP13 and WAC) for cancer progression. Finally, in vivo

 validation in a prostate-specific Pten-deficient background revealed that the autophagy-
regulating gene Wac is a novel obligate haploinsufficient tumor suppressor.
Results
A Sleeping Beauty-dependent inactivatable Pten allele
To uncover tumor suppressors collaborating with Pten-deficiency in cancer progression, we 
generated mice carrying a Pten allele inactivatable upon Sleeping Beauty (SB)-mediated 
transposition (PtenSBm2/+) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a-f). Briefly, Pten exon 5, 
containing the phosphatase domain, was flanked by two SB terminal repeats (TRs). In the 
absence of SB, the Pten allele functions normally, but it becomes inactivated upon SB 
transposase-mediated mobilization of the transposon, which can be reinserted in the genome, 
potentially generating an additional loss-of-function mutation in another locus of the same 
cell. As demonstrated by an Hprt trapping assay, the mobilized Pten exon 5, bearing its 
natural splice acceptor, functions as a gene disrupting element (Supplementary Fig. 2a).
PtenSBm2/+ mice were intercrossed with mice carrying the SB11 transposase into the Rosa26 
locus (Rosa26SB11/SB11), to induce transposition, and a mutant Bloom allele (Blmm3/m3), to 
favor loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the inactivating genetic events, as Bloom (Blm) 
deficiency increases mitotic recombination14,15. This produced PtenSBm2/+; Rosa26SB11/+; 
Blmm3/m3 mice (hereafter PSB, n=59). Additionally, to enrich the number of transposon-
induced mutations in each cell, a concatemer with ~35 copies of an inactivating transposon 
(ITP2m) was established in a subset of mice: PtenSBm2/+; ITP2m; Rosa26SB11/+; Blmm3/m3 
(hereafter PISB, n=86) (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Also, ITP2m; Rosa26SB11/+; 
Blmm3/m3 (hereafter ISB, n=15) and Rosa26SB11/+; Blmm3/m3 (hereafter SB, n=15) mice 
were generated as controls. Mice were monitored and sacrificed at the onset of signs of 
morbidity.
Identification of Pten-cooperating tumor suppressors
PSB and PISB mice presented a wide range of neoplastic lesions including prostate, breast, 
skin, endometrial, intestinal and adrenal tumors with high incidence, as well as lymphomas, 
thyroid, lung and ureter tumors (Fig. 1c,d and data not shown). These corresponded to 
cancer types commonly observed in Pten-deficient mouse models16. Mean survival was 
shorter in the PISB cohort compared to the PSB cohort (337 versus 419 days; P < 0.0001; 
log-rank test) (Fig. 1e) although both groups showed similar incidence of total and 
malignant tumors (Fig. 1c). These results reveal synergy between PtenSBm2 and ITP2m in 
accelerating tumorigenesis.
To identify transposon integrations we performed Illumina sequencing of sheared and 
barcoded tumor DNA as previously described17. We sequenced 127 prostate tumors (PSB: 
45; PISB: 82), 26 breast tumors (PSB: 12; PISB: 14) and 125 skin tumors (PSB: 43; PISB: 
82) yielding 1,193,651 non-redundant transposon insertions with a minimal read coverage of 
2. Subsequently, we applied statistical analyses based on Gaussian Kernel Convolution 
separately to six datasets, corresponding to the insertions identified in tumors from the same 
tissue (prostate, breast or skin) and in the same mouse cohort (PSB or PISB), to identify

 genomic loci hit significantly more frequently than predicted by chance18. These common 
insertion sites (CIS) are likely to contain cancer driver genes. As SB shows tendency to re-
integrate close to the transposon donor locus (a phenomenon known as local hopping)14,19, 
we excluded CIS mapping to the donor chromosomes (19 for PtenSBm2 and 14 for ITP2m), 
producing lists of 190 and 1170 CIS respectively from the PSB and PISB prostate tumors, 
101 and 291 CIS from the PSB and PISB breast tumors, and 287 and 665 CIS from the PSB 
and PISB skin tumors (Table 1 and Supplementary Tables 1-7).
717 CIS were exclusively found in the prostate, 191 were breast-specific and 329 were only 
detected in the skin tumors, whereas 101 were common to all 3 tumor types. Of these, 7 
were present in the 6 CIS lists generated from both PSB and PISB mice in prostate, breast 
and skin tumors, including well-known Pten-cooperating genes (Nf1, Cul3 and Tnrc6b) and 
candidate tumor suppressors (Kansl1, Arih1, Dyrk1a and Chd2) (Fig. 1f and Supplementary 
Table 8) 12,20–22. In summary, these genome-wide screens reveal comprehensive sets of 
tumor suppressor genes that cooperate with Pten in a global or tissue-specific manner.
Coupled Pten-inactivation and transposition mimic human prostate tumorigenesis
We focused on prostate cancer considering its high incidence in humans and in our mice, as 
well as the central role of PTEN in its pathogenesis. Pten+/- mice develop non-invasive 
prostate tumors with incomplete penetrance23, whereas complete tumor penetrance is 
observed upon prostate-specific Pten-inactivation24. The presence of concomitant genetic 
alterations in Pten+/- mice has also been shown to trigger prostate cancer progression25–30. 
The combination of the PtenSBm2 allele and the SB transposase in PSB and PISB mice 
should facilitate the coupled inactivation of Pten and cooperating tumor suppressors. 
Moreover, Blm deficiency should favor LOH of both the inactivated Pten allele and the 
transposon-targeted loci, accelerating tumor formation and progression.
In agreement with these predictions, all PSB (n=38) and PISB (n=49) males showed prostate 
gland enlargement, which, in a high proportion (50% and 72%, respectively), progressed to 
invasive adenocarcinoma (Fig. 1c). As in human prostate cancer, progression was 
accompanied by decrease of Pten protein levels and correlative increase in the proportion of 
actively proliferating, Ki67 positive, cells. Moreover, the contiguity of p63 staining observed 
in normal epithelium and in prostate intraepithelial neoplasias (PIN) was lost in invasive 
adenocarcinomas (Fig. 2a,b). In addition, Pten LOH was detected in 9/9 analyzed tumors 
(Fig. 2c). These data indicate that prostate tumorigenesis in our model mirrors the 
progression of human prostate cancer, confirming its suitability for the molecular 
characterization of this malignancy.
Prostate CISs are enriched in human cancer genes
Interestingly, 70% of the genes found in PSB overlap with those in PISB (P < 2.2 x 10-16; 
Fisher’s exact test) (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 7), indicating that the same signaling 
pathways support prostate cancer development in both cohorts (significant overlaps were 
also observed in breast, P = 3.6 x 10-16, and skin tumors, P < 2.2 x 10-16; Fisher’s exact test; 
Supplementary Fig. 3a,d and Supplementary Table 7). To explore the biological and clinical 
relevance of the genes identified in the prostate tumors, we determined their enrichment in 
de la Rosa et al.

 genes known to be involved in human cancer. CIS genes with human homologues (hCISs) in 
PSB (hCISs=160) and PISB tumors (hCISs=1047), as well as those shared between both 
groups (referred to as PSB∩PISB hCISs=115) were analyzed independently. PSB, PISB and 
PSB∩PISB hCISs were significantly enriched in known and candidate cancer genes listed 
respectively in the Cancer Gene Census database (CGC) (PSB, P = 5.50 x 10-16; PISB, P < 
2.2 x 10-16; PSB∩PISB, P = 1.22 x 10-14, Fisher’s exact test) and the Network of Cancer 
Genes (NCG)31 (PSB, P = 0.005377; PISB, P = 4.27 x 10-7; PSB∩PISB, P = 0.003752; 
Fisher’s exact test) (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Tables 9-10). This 
highlights the potential of combining human cancer sequencing with transposon-based 
screening for prioritizing and cross-validating candidate cancer genes.
We next asked whether hCIS were enriched in human prostate cancer genes. Genomic 
rearrangements and copy number variations represent a major source of DNA alteration in 
prostate cancers. Given the exclusive inactivating capacity of our transposons, we compared 
the list of hCISs to genes recurrently deleted in human prostate cancer. The analysis of 336 
primary prostate tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that a significant 
proportion of PSB, PISB and PSB∩PISB hCISs genes were homozygously deleted in this 
sample set (P = 0.01945, P = 1.82 x 10-6, P = 0.01042, respectively; Fisher’s exact test) 
(Supplementary Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 11). Moreover, considering only TCGA 
deleted genes which were also downregulated in prostate cancer led to sharply increased 
significance of the intersections (P = 0.00088, P = 4.74 x 10-10, P = 0.00086, respectively; 
Fisher’s exact test), further supporting the involvement of these genes as tumor suppressors 
(Supplementary Fig. 4d,e and Supplementary Table 12).
General features of PSB and PISB prostate cancer CIS genes
To identify genes contributing to prostate cancer progression, we focused on the curated 
PSB∩PISB hCISs (117 mouse genes corresponding to 115 human orthologues) 
(Supplementary Table 13). The analysis of their transposon integration pattern (as well as of 
those of breast and skin tumors) revealed the presence of insertions scattered along these 
genes, consistent with tumor suppressor functions (Supplementary Figs. 5-7). Accordingly, 
RNAseq analysis of PSB and PISB prostate tumors identified chimeric transcripts of CIS 
genes where transposon insertions caused disruption of their reading frames (Supplementary 
Table 14).
To demonstrate the significance of these CIS genes, we studied their distribution among the 
tumors analyzed. As shown in figure 2e, a number of genes are hit in most neoplasms (a 
phenomenon also seen in breast and skin tumors; Supplementary. Fig. 3b,e), with a median 
of 20 and 33 hits per prostate tumor in the PSB and PISB cohorts, respectively. The presence 
of multiple hits per tumor in the single-transposon cohort supports the co-existence of 
multiple tumor subclones with different insertions cooperating with Pten-disruption within a 
tumor. This is in line with recent human studies providing evidence for polyclonality in 
prostate cancer32–34. Genes frequently mutated in the PSB tumors were also highly 
mutated in the PISB cohort (R = 0.82, P < 2.2 x 10-16) (Fig. 2f), demonstrating their 
importance for driving prostate cancer. Significant positive correlations are also detectable in 
de la Rosa et al.

 breast (R = 0.77, P = 1.17 x 10-4) and skin (R = 0.88, P < 2.2 x 10-16) tumors 
(Supplementary Fig. 3c,f).
To explore the potential cooperation of these genes with PTEN-inactivation in driving 
prostate tumorigenesis, we evaluated the mRNA expression levels of PTEN and our list of 
PSB∩PISB genes in human prostate tumors from the TCGA, Taylor35 and Barbieri36 
datasets. Of note, the PSB∩PISB hCIS set is highly enriched in genes whose mRNA 
expression levels correlate with those of PTEN, which might reflect a tendency for 
PSB∩PISB hCIS genes to be co-regulated with PTEN (Fig. 2g). This finding suggests the 
validity of our screen for pinpointing genes involved in PTEN-related processes in prostate 
cancer.
Deregulated pathways in PSB and PISB prostate cancers
To deepen into the molecular and biological function of the prostate PSB∩PISB CIS genes, 
we applied DAVID gene-set enrichment analysis37 using KEGG, BioCarta and GO-term 
datasets (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 15) (for similar breast and skin CIS analyses see 
Supplementary Tables 16 and 17). Chromatin/histone modifying enzymes constitute one of 
the most significantly enriched pathways. Histone methylase genes such as ARID1A or 
those of members of the MLL protein family (MLL1, MLL5) are recurrently mutated in 
prostate cancer, in association with advanced disease stages36,38. Moreover, they interact 
with the androgen receptor (AR), a key player in prostate tumorigenesis38. Additionally, 
loss of the histone acetylase CREBBP cooperates with PTEN haploinsufficiency in driving 
prostate cancer39.
We identified a large number of genes involved in RNA stability, splicing and transcriptional 
regulation. The homeodomain transcription factors MEIS1 and PBX1, known oncogenes for 
other malignancies, are down-regulated at various stages of prostate cancer progression40. 
Our results constitute the first in vivo indication of their tumor suppressive role in the 
prostate. In the case of Pbx1, transposon distribution and chimeric transcript data support 
this view (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 14). Similarly, the gene encoding 
transcription factor FOXP1 has been described as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, 
depending on the context4,41. The distribution of insertions along Foxp1 in our screen 
points to a tumor suppressor role, in agreement with recent findings in human prostate 
cancer42 (Supplementary Fig. 5). Another interesting transcription factor hit by our screen 
and known to be altered in prostate cancer is ETV6. Unlike other ETS genes, ETV6 is not 
involved in gene fusions in human prostate tumors. Instead, ETV6 is hemizygously deleted 
in ~25% of clinically localized prostate cancer, consistent with our results43.
Genes involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis were also significantly enriched, especially 
E3-ubiquitin ligases. Exome sequencing of 112 prostate adenocarcinomas has previously 
revealed the substrate-binding subunit of CUL3-based E3 ligase, named SPOP, as the gene 
most frequently mutated in this malignancy36. The Cul3 CIS in our screen suggests that 
alterations in other members of this E3-ligase complex may have similar consequences.
Alterations in intracellular membrane trafficking, intercellular communication or 
cytoskeleton organization also emerged as important molecular networks which can

 compromise cell polarity. PTEN plays essential roles in cellular polarization, in part by 
recruitment to the endocytic vesicles44,45. Thus, the PTEN-interacting polarity protein 
PARD3, a tumor suppressor in different tumor types but unexplored in prostate cancer, 
comes up as an interesting candidate.
Finally, our screens identified alterations of central signaling networks in prostate cancer 
such as androgen receptor (AR) signaling (Nrip1, Yy1, Mll1, Mll5, Foxp1), RAS/MAPK 
(Rasa1, Nf1, Erbb2ip) and PI3K/AKT (Pik3r1, Magi3, Pten ceRNAs). In fact, a large 
number of putative Pten competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), including the validated 
ceRNAs Cnot6l and Tnrc6b20,46 were present among our CISs. In the polyclonal PSB and 
PISB tumors, disruption of Pten ceRNAs would further decrease Pten function in those 
subclones without Pten LOH. In a previous SB screen focusing on melanoma, 33 Pten 
ceRNAs were identified20. We found a significant overlap between these and our CIS genes 
(PSB, P = 6.58 x 10-10; PISB, P < 2.2 x 10-16; PSB∩PISB, P = 3.63 x 10-11; Fisher’s exact 
test) (Supplementary Fig. 8a and Supplementary Table 18). Moreover, our CIS genes were 
significantly enriched among the PTEN ceRNAs predicted by the ceFINDER algorithm47 
(PSB, P = 4.51 x 10-12; PISB, P < 2.2 x 10-16, PSB∩PISB, P = 2.44 x 10-10; Fisher’s exact 
test) (Supplementary Fig. 8b and Supplementary Table 19).
Co-silencing of PTEN and candidate genes drives invasion
To explore the role of the identified genes in the evolution of cancer, we used small 
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to silence the expression of candidate genes in two immortalized 
but non-transformed human prostate cell lines, named BPH-1 and RWPE-1. In contrast to 
cancer cells, immortalized cells resemble more closely the primary cells they derive from 
and, therefore, do not contain cancer driving genetic alterations. Thus, we tested the effect of 
inhibiting the expression of our CIS genes, either alone or in combination with PTEN-
silencing, on their invasive ability in vitro.
We selected five of the twenty genes most frequently hit by transposons in our screens, 
which were not annotated in the Cancer Gene Census and for which a role in prostate cancer 
had not been described so far (Fig. 3b and Table 1). These genes are ZBTB20 (Zinc finger 
and BTB domain containing 20), CELF2 (CUGBP, Elav-Like Family member 2), AKAP13 
(A-Kinase Anchor Protein 13), PARD3 (Par-3 family cell polarity regulator) and WAC (WW 
domain containing Adaptor with Coiled-coil). Co-silencing of PTEN together with each of 
the candidates in BPH-1 and RWPE-1 cells sharply increased their invasiveness (Fig. 4a, 
Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 20). This synergistic effect is consistent 
with a cooperative role of these genes with PTEN in preventing malignant progression.
Oncogenic pathways disrupted by co-silencing
To examine the molecular basis of this phenotype, we performed RNAseq transcriptomic 
profiling of BPH-1 and RWPE-1 cell lines upon candidate silencing or co-silencing with 
PTEN (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Tables 21-25). Principal component 
analysis revealed that the first component was determined by the cell line, whereas the 
second component discriminated single-gene knock-down from co-silencing conditions (Fig 
de la Rosa et al.

 4b). This suggests rewiring of common molecular pathways irrespective of the gene being 
co-silenced with PTEN.
Pathway enrichment analysis of transcriptional changes associated with co-silencing (versus 
single PTEN-silencing), showed common themes shared by the candidates (Fig. 4c and 
Supplementary Tables 26-35). Among the upregulated genes, enrichment was detected for 
pathways promoting cancer progression: epithelial-mesenchymal transition, MYC-
dependent transcriptional activation, MET/RAS/MAPK signaling and PI3K/AKT/MTOR 
signaling. Accordingly, Western blot analysis showed that, compared with single PTEN-
silencing, co-silencing of each of the candidates induced increased levels of p-AKT and/or 
p-mTOR without further reduction of PTEN levels (Supplementary Fig. 11). The 
downregulated genes were enriched in pathways including mitotic spindle formation, Rho 
GTPases, DNA damage response, TGFβ and androgen receptor (AR) signaling. PTEN 
deletion in human and murine prostate tumors has been previously described to decrease the 
AR transcriptional output, as the PI3K and AR oncogenic pathways cross-regulate each 
other by reciprocal feedback48. Several of these pathways (AR, RAS/MAPK and PI3K/
AKT) are also overrepresented in the PSB∩PISB CIS from prostate tumors.
Clinical relevance of validated genes
We then analyzed the mRNA expression of these genes in prostate tumors from the TCGA 
dataset. ZBTB20, CELF2, PARD3, AKAP13 and WAC mRNA levels were significantly 
reduced in primary prostate cancer samples (n=336) compared with benign tissues (n=65) 
(Fig. 5a). To investigate more advanced stages of the disease, we analyzed the Taylor 
dataset35, including primary (n=131) and metastatic samples (n=29). We observed a further 
reduction of mRNA expression of these genes upon progression to metastasis (Fig. 5b). 
Additionally, a positive correlation was detected in primary tumors between PTEN and 
ZBTB20, CELF2, PARD3 and WAC gene expression (Fig. 5c). This is stronger (and 
extensive to AKAP13) when more advanced tumors are included in the analysis (Fig 5d), 
supporting the cooperation between PTEN and these genes in preventing cancer progression. 
With the exception of CELF2, correlation is clearer for PTEN log2 expression levels above 
8.5. Although gene-expression independent regulatory mechanisms might operate, this could 
also reflect that the contribution of ZBTB20, PARD3, AKAP13 and WAC to prevent cancer 
progression is stronger when PTEN function is perturbed, but not lost. In addition to these 
observations, recurrence-free survival of patients with tumors expressing low levels of these 
genes was strikingly reduced (Fig. 5e). This was also true for ZBTB20, AKAP13 and WAC 
when the analysis was restricted to primary tumors (Supplementary Fig. 12). Altogether, 
these results highlight the clinical relevance of the PTEN-cooperating tumor suppressor 
genes identified.
Wac: a new obligate haploinsufficient prostate cancer gene
To explore the in vivo effects of Wac disruption on mouse prostate tumorigenesis, we 
generated a mouse model with prostate-specific Pten homozygous inactivation combined 
with prostate-specific Wac heterozygous/homozygous deletion. Tumor development in these 
mice disclosed complex interactions between Wac and Pten deficiencies. Compared with 
prostate-specific PtenΔ/Δ mice, prostate-specific PtenΔ/Δ; Wac+/Δ mice developed larger

 tumors, whereas prostate-specific PtenΔ/Δ; WacΔ/Δ mice were protected from tumor 
progression (Fig. 6a). This reveals a phenomenon of obligate haploinsufficiency by which, 
under Pten-deficiency, partial Wac inactivation potentiates tumor growth, whereas complete 
Wac inactivation precludes it.
The tumor promoting effect of partial Wac inactivation is more evident at earlier cancer 
development stages: it leads to significantly increased tumor sizes in 4-month old PtenΔ/Δ; 
Wac+/Δ mice, whereas only a tendency towards larger tumors is observed 5 months later 
(Fig. 6a,b). This is consistent with the proposed role of Wac as an activator of autophagy, a 
process known to exert dual effects on cancer, suppressing tumor initiation and promoting 
the growth of established cancers49–52.
Discussion
PTEN, the second most frequently mutated/deleted gene in human cancer, is a key controller 
of signaling nodes in multiple tumor types53,54. Based on a novel strategy which couples 
targeted gene inactivation to single-copy transposon mobilization, we have performed a 
genome-wide survey for genes cooperating with Pten in suppressing tumorigenesis in mice. 
Our model recapitulates the progressive histological, immunohistochemical and genetic 
alterations of human prostate cancer, confirming its suitability for the molecular 
characterization of this malignancy. Our studies revealed comprehensive landscapes of 
tissue-specific and global Pten-collaborating genes, pathways and biological processes, 
including RNA metabolism, chromatin remodeling or ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. 
Previous work has proven the utility of transposon-based somatic mutagenesis to identify 
and validate candidate cancer genes4–8,10–13. Our strategy meets these objectives and 
opens novel applications of somatic transposition by introducing relevant features.
First, the single-copy transposon limits the number of insertions to one per cell, which is 
aimed at reducing the number of passenger insertions and increasing the specificity of the 
screen. To our knowledge, this is the first time a single-copy transposon has been shown to 
generate significant CISs in a somatic mutagenesis screen. Second, our approach achieves 
transposon-dependent targeted gene disruption, favoring the identification of insertions 
cooperating with the engineered mutation (in our case, Pten-inactivation). Transposons have 
been successfully used before together with Cre-dependent activation/inactivation of known 
oncogenes/tumor suppressors, including Pten3,6,8,11–13. However, using a Cre-inactivated 
Pten-floxed allele does not guarantee perfect coupling of Pten-inactivation and transposon 
mobilization. In contrast, in our model transposition only happens in cells that have 
undergone Pten-inactivation, avoiding the development of transposon-induced tumors with 
intact Pten. Third, our screen exclusively involves inactivating transposition. Although this 
precludes the identification of potential oncogenes, it facilitates interpretation of the roles of 
uncharacterized candidate genes.
Detailed analysis of prostate cancer CISs showed enrichment in known (CGC) and putative 
(NCG) cancer genes. All genes had insertions evenly distributed along their loci, the pattern 
expected for tumor suppressors. Consistently, they overlap significantly with genes 
combining homozygous deletions and downregulation of their expression in TCGA human

 prostate cancer samples. In addition, they are enriched in genes whose expression levels 
positively correlate with those of PTEN in human prostate cancer, supporting the specificity 
of the screen to pinpoint PTEN-cooperating genes. We prioritized our characterization/
validation efforts on 5 genes ranking among the 20 most frequently hit prostate cancer CIS 
and not previously described as cancer drivers. We confirmed the effect of ZBTB20, CELF2, 
PARD3, AKAP13 and WAC genetic inhibition in Pten-deficient contexts to enhance 
invasion and unleash canonical cancer-promoting pathways, and we provided evidence of 
their clinical relevance in human prostate cancer. Finally, we characterized Wac as a new 
obligate haploinssuficient tumor suppressor in vivo.
Wac obligate haploinsufficiency agrees with its proposed role as an autophagy activator 
50,51. Co-silencing of WAC and PTEN resulted in the downregulation of pathways directly 
related to autophagy, such as KEGG_LYSOSOME and KEGG_PEROXISOME (FDR q-
values = 0.000) (Supplementary Table 35). Heterozygous disruption of Becn1, a Wac-
interacting gene essential for autophagy, increases the frequency of spontaneous 
malignancies and accelerates HBV-induced hepatocellular carcinogenesis55. However, liver 
tumors arising from becn1 allelic loss do not undergo LOH, suggesting obligate 
haploinsufficiency49. In addition, autophagy abrogation by complete loss of Atg7 delays 
Pten-deficient prostate tumor progression56. Our results parallel these observations, as 
heterozygous Wac deletion promotes prostate tumor progression, whereas its complete loss 
constrains it. Autophagy exerts dual effects on cancer, suppressing initiation but promoting 
growth of established cancers49,52. Accordingly, Wac inactivation leads to significantly 
larger tumors in 4-month old PtenΔ/Δ; Wac+/Δ mice, but only a tendency is observed 5 
months later (Fig. 6a,b). These findings, likely to underlie the modest decrease of WAC 
mRNA levels accompanying human prostate cancer progression, are relevant for basic and 
translational oncology. Moreover, the dependence of Pten-deficient tumors on Wac function 
opens potential opportunities for drug development.
Our approach recapitulates the sporadic nature of human tumorigenesis, where mutations in 
relevant cancer genes occur randomly in individual cells from any tissue surrounded by 
healthy cells. Beyond prostate cancer, mice in our cohorts developed several tumor types for 
which Pten relevance is well documented. Exploration of the potential of the novel putative 
tumor suppressors to prevent such cancers is warranted. Hopefully, our results will lay the 
basis for therapeutic strategies inspired in the tumor suppressor networks identified through 
this screen.
Online Methods
Mouse strains
All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal 
Scientific Procedures Act 1986 and the Committee on Animal Experimentation of the 
University of Oviedo. Rosa26SB11 transposase knock-in, Bloom mutant (Blmm3), prostate-
specific PB-Cre4 deleter and Flpo deleter mice were previously described14,15. 
Wactm2a(EUCOMM)Wtsi mice were obtained from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute 
(International Knockout Mouse Consortium). The generation of PtenSBm2 and ITP2m+ mice 
is described in the following sections. To generate the experimental and control mice used in

 the transposon screens, PtenSBm2, ITP2m and Blmm3 mice were successively interbred to 
generate PtenSBm2/+; ITP2m; Blmm3/m3 triple-transgenic mice. At the same time, 
Rosa26SB11 mice were crossed with Blmm3/m3 animals and intercrossed to produce 
Rosa26SB11/SB11; Blmm3/m3 mice. Finally, PtenSBm2/+; ITP2m; Blmm3/m3 mice were crossed 
to Rosa26SB11/SB11; Blmm3/m3 mice to obtain PtenSBm2/+; Rosa26SB11/+; Blmm3/m3 (PSB), 
PtenSBm2/+; ITP2m; Rosa26SB11/+; Blmm3/m3 (PISB), ITP2m +; Rosa26SB11/+; Blmm3/m3 
(ISB) and Rosa26SB11/+; Blmm3/m3 (SB) animals. To generate mice with a Wac conditional 
knockout allele (referred to as Wactm2c(EUCOMM)Wtsi), Wactm2a(EUCOMM)Wtsi knockout-first 
mice were initially crossed to Flpo recombinase transgenic mice to remove the FRT-flanked 
disrupting cassette57. Subsequently, the offspring carrying the tm2c allele was outcrossed to 
wild type C57BL/6 mice and those animals with the tm2c allele and negative for Flpo were 
selected and interbred. To generate prostate-specific deletion of Pten and Wac, PtenSBm2, 
Wactm2c(EUCOMM)Wtsi and PB-Cre4 recombinase mice were successively intercrossed to 
generate the desired genotypes. Only males with the PB-Cre4 allele were used in breedings 
with PtenSBm2 and Wactm2c(EUCOMM)Wtsi mice as Cre expression was reported to occur in 
the oocytes of PB-Cre4 females. Control and experimental mice were on a mixed C57BL/6, 
129Sv and FVB genetic backgrounds. Mice were assigned to experimental groups based on 
their genotypes, so no randomization was required. Mice were genotyped by conventional 
PCR of ear/tail clips using the primers listed in Supplementary Table 36.
Generation of the PtenSBm2 allele
In the PtenSBm2 allele, Pten exon 5 is flanked by two copies of the natural 5’ (left) Sleeping 
Beauty (SB) terminal repeat (TR) (one in direct orientation, and the other one as reverse 
complement), as this configuration displays enhanced transposition efficiency compared 
with the native SB transposon58. Each TR is separated from the Pten exon 5 by 
approximately 500 bp of intronic sequences (last 500 bp from intron 4 and first 500 bp from 
intron 5). To generate the targeting construct, first, an SB TR was introduced into a mouse 
BAC (343F11) through recombineering. For that, a fragment from pQL2 (a vector originally 
developed by Qi Liang to place a SB TR into genomic DNA by recombineering, and 
conferring kanamycin resistance) spanning from the SB TR to the end of the Neo/Kan 
resistance cassette of pQL2 was amplified by PCR, which was also used to add to each end 
70 bp of homology with contiguous regions of Pten intron 4 as well as a Lox2272 site in one 
end (between the 70 bp of homology and the SB TR). EL350 recombineering competent 
bacteria59 containing the 343F11 mouse BAC were electroporated with this PCR product, 
and recombinant colonies were isolated by dual chrolamphenicol and kanamycin selection. 
After this, the region containing Pten exon 5 and the first introduced SB TR flanked by 6.7 
kb and 5.5 kb of mouse genomic DNA at their 5’ and 3’ ends, respectively, was retrieved 
into pBS-DTA through recombineering. For that, EL350 carrying the modified 343F11 
mouse BAC were electroporated with a fragment of linear DNA amplified from pBS-DTA 
(conferring ampicillin resistance) using primers which introduced 5’ and 3’ tails, each with 
70 bases of homology to the boundaries of the genomic regions to be retrieved. Transformed 
bacteria were selected for ampicillin/kanamycin resistance. After this, mini-preps from the 
positive EL350 cells were retransformed to segregate mixtures of recombinant and non-
recombinant plasmids replicating in the same bacterium. Then, PTSA3 and PTSA4, two 
short (400 bp each) arms of homology to Pten intron 5 were PCR amplified using Phusion 
de la Rosa et al.

 polymerase and DNA from the 343F11 BAC as template. During PCR amplification of 
PTSA3, a Lox2272 site was attached to its 3’ end. PTSA3-Lox2272 and PTSA4 were cloned 
in pZK5-SB-FRT (developed by Qi Liang to introduce another SB repeat into genomic 
DNA, and conferring kanamycin resistance (for bacteria) and puromycin resistance (for 
mammalian cells) in a four-way ligation which also contained the puΔTK cassette extracted 
from pZK5-SB-FRT. The resulting plasmid was linearized and electroporated into the 
EL350 cells generated from the previous step. Kanamycin/chloramphenicol resistant 
bacteria were selected and the completeness of the resulting targeting construct, containing 
also the second SB repeat 500 bp downstream of Pten exon 5 and an FRT flanked puΔTK 
cassette, was checked by digestion with multiple restriction enzymes and capillary Sanger 
sequencing. Large quantities of pure plasmid were obtained by Maxi-prep (Qiagen). The 
NotI linearized targeting vector was electroporated in AB1 ES cells and puromycin resistant 
clones were selected, expanded and microinjected in blastocysts to generate chimaeric mice, 
from which knock-in progeny containing the PtenSBm1 allele were obtained. These mice 
were subsequently bred to Rosa26-FlpE mice to remove the FRT-flanked puΔTK cassette, 
and thus generate the PtenSBm2 allele.
Generation of the ITP2m concatemer
To generate ITP2m transposons, which have both PB and SB terminal repeats (TRs) and can 
therefore be mobilized with both transposon systems, TRs were cloned into pBlueScript and 
the following genetic elements were introduced in between them: an adenovirus splice 
acceptor (AV-SA), five bidirectional SV40 polyadenylation signals (pA) and a splice 
acceptor from exon 2 of the mouse Engrailed-2 gene (En2SA). ITP2m transposons were cut 
out of pBlueScript and prepared for pronuclear injection using standard techniques as 
described in Rad et al. 20109.
Necropsy and histopathological analysis
Mice were monitored for tumors at least twice a week and sacrificed before tumor masses 
compromised their well-being or at the onset of other signs of morbidity. For DNA 
extraction, tumors were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For histological studies, tumors were 
fixed in 4% formaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and 
eosin for morphological examination. Necropsies were performed by several investigators 
who were not actively blinded to the mouse genotype. Samples were excluded if post-
necropsy genotyping did not confirm initial genotyping. Tissue samples were examined by 
four experienced histopathologists (A.A., M.S.F.-G., M.T.F.-G. and G.H.) blinded to mouse 
genotypes.
Immunohistochemistry
Sections from tissue micro-arrays containing 114 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded PSB or 
PISB mouse tumors were cut at 5 μM for immunohistochemical detection of PTEN, p63 and 
Ki67 on a DAKO Autostainer. After deparaffinization, heat-induced antigen retrieval was 
performed. Subsequently, primary antibody incubation was carried out using the following 
antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-PTEN (M3627, Agilent Technologies, 1:200), mouse 
monoclonal anti-p63 (IR662, Agilent Technologies, Ready-to-Use) and rabbit monoclonal 
anti-ki67 (KI681C01, DCS Innovative Diagnostik-Systeme, 1:150), respectively. Sections

 were then incubated with the secondary antibodies anti-mouse (for PTEN and p63) and anti-
rabbit (for ki67) from Agilent Technologies for 30 minutes at room temperature, and stained 
with chromagen DAB (3-3´-diaminobenzidine, Dako). Finally, they were counterstained for 
10 minutes with Dako Hematoxilin. Ki67 and Pten staining intensities were graded as 
negative (-), mild (+), moderate (++) and intense (+++) in the PIN, adenocarcinoma and 
normal tissue components of each tumor.
Splinkerette PCR and Illumina sequencing
These were done as previously described17.
Identification of common integration sites (CISs)
Transposon insertions were mapped to the mouse genome using the SSAHA2 algorithm. 
Query sequences were filtered to contain splinkerette primer sequences that were located in 
the transposon ITRs. Redundant sequences from the same tumor and mapping to the same 
genomic location were ‘collapsed’ to a single integration. To identify those regions in the 
genome hit by transposons significantly more frequently than expected by chance (so called 
CISs), non-redundant insertions were analyzed using a Gaussian Kernel Convolution–based 
framework18 for different kernel window sizes (from 10 kb to 100 kb, in 10 kb steps, plus 
an extra 200-kb window). CISs predicted across multiple scales and overlapping in their 
genomic locations were clustered together, and only the ones obtained using the smallest 
windows were reported. SfiI, a known artifactual CIS frequently found in transposon 
screens, was filtered out from the definitive CIS lists. Curated lists were obtained after 
removal of predicted genes.
RNAseq analysis
RNAseq libraries were constructed using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded RNA protocol with 
oligo dT pulldown and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2500 by 75-bp paired-end sequencing. 
For RNAseq transcriptomic profiling of BPH-1 and RWPE-1 cell lines, analysis was 
performed using TopHat60 version 2.0.13. Read counts were obtained using HTSeq61 
version 0.6.1 and differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq262 
software package version 1.14.1. RNAseq analysis of transposon-CIS RNA chimeric 
transcripts was done as previously described by Temiz et al.63 Sequencing reads were 
aligned to the mouse reference genome GRCm38 with exon 5 of Pten masked at the locus 
and the transposon sequence containing Pten exon 5 added to the reference as a separate 
sequence. Alignment to this modified reference genome was performed using GSNAP64 
version 2015-11-20 and fusions with Pten exon 5 were identified employing our own 
software implementation in the scripting language Python. Python scripts used for the fusion 
analysis are available upon request.
Pathway enrichment analysis
Pathway enrichment analysis was performed by DAVID37 (using KEGG, BioCarta and GO-
term datasets) and the GSEAPreranked module from GSEA v3.0 (using hallmark and 
canonical pathways datasets65. Results obtained with DAVID were visualized by the 
Cytoscape Enrichment Map plugin66.

 Gene-silencing and invasion assays
For gene-silencing experiments, BPH-1 and RWPE-1 immortalized human prostate cells, 
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and previously checked to 
exclude mycoplasma contamination, were transfected with 10 nM final concentration of 
siRNA oligonucleotides purchased from Life Technologies (Silencer Select Pre-Designed 
and Validated siRNAs) using Lipofectamine RNAi Max (Life Technologies) in Opti-MEM I 
Reduced Serum Medium without serum (Gibco) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Two days later, their invasive potential was evaluated using 24-well Matrigel-coated invasion 
chambers with an 8 mm pore size (BD Biosciences). For BPH-1, 6 x 105 cells were allowed 
to invade for 72 h using 15% fetal bovine serum as a chemoattractant, whereas for RWPE-1 
cells, 8 x 105 cells were seeded and allowed to invade for 48 h, using bovine pituitary extract 
(BPE) and human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF) as chemoattractants. Cells 
that reached the lower surface were stained with crystal violet and counted under the 
microscope.
SDS-PAGE and Western blot
Cultured cells were homogenized in SDS lysis buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 
2% SDS, 50 mM EDTA pH 8, protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340, Sigma) and phosphatase 
inhibitor cocktails (P5726 and P0044, Sigma). Protein concentration was evaluated with the 
bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit). Equal amounts of proteins (10 μg) 
were loaded onto 4-20% precast polyacrylamide gels (BioRad). After electrophoresis, gels 
were electrotransferred onto PVDF membranes (BioRad), blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk 
in TBS-T buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 hour at 
room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with various primary antibodies: rabbit 
monoclonal anti-PTEN (9188, Cell Signaling, 1:1000), rabbit monoclonal anti-pAKT (4060, 
Cell Signaling, 1:1000), rabbit monoclonal anti-AKT (4691, Cell Signaling, 1:1000), rabbit 
monoclonal anti-pmTOR (2971, Cell Signaling, 1:1000), rabbit monoclonal anti-mTOR 
(2983, Cell Signaling, 1:1000) or mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH (G8795, Sigma, 
1:10,000). Finally, we incubated the blots with goat anti-rabbit or horse anti-mouse 
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling) diluted 1:3,000 in 
2.5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T, washed them and developed the immunoreactive bands with 
Clarity Western ECL (BioRad).
Quantitative RT-PCR
For qRT-PCR, cells were collected 72 h after transfection and total RNA was extracted using 
the RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized with Thermoscript RT-PCR 
(Invitrogen). qPCR was carried out in triplicate for each sample using 20 ng of cDNA per 
reaction, TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and 1 μL of TaqMan 
Gene Expression Assay probes (Life Technologies) for ZBTB20, CELF2, PARD3, 
AKAP13, WAC and GAPDH, the latter used as an internal control for the amount of 
template cDNA (Supplementary Fig. 13).

 Figure 1. A Sleeping Beauty-dependent inactivatable Pten allele for coupled whole-body 
mutagenesis and tumor suppressor discovery in mice.
(a,b) Transposon-bearing mice used in this study. (a) Single-copy transposon mice (PSB, 
Pten
SBm2/+; Rosa26SB11/+; Blmm3/m3) harbor the novel PtenSBm2 allele, in which Pten exon 
5 is flanked by two Sleeping Beauty terminal repeats (SB TRs). This converts the whole 
cassette into an inactivating transposon which can be mobilized and reintegrated in the 
genome by the SB transposase, concurrently deleting Pten exon 5. (b) Multiple-copy 
transposon mice (PISB, PtenSBm2/+; ITP2m; Rosa26SB11/+; Blmm3/m3), carry PtenSBm2 and
