Abstract 
Objective: To test effects of gestational age (GA), early social experiences, and child 
characteristics on children’s friendships and perceived peer acceptance. 
Study design: As part of the prospective Bavarian Longitudinal Study (1147 children, 25-41 
weeks GA), children’s friendships (e.g., number of friends, frequency of meeting friends) and 
perceived peer acceptance were assessed before school entry (6 years of age) and in 
second grade (8 years of age) using child and parent reports. The parent-infant relationship 
was evaluated during the 5 months after birth. Child characteristics (i.e., height, motor 
impairment, cognitive ability, behavioral problems) were measured at 6 years of age. Multiple 
regressions estimated effects of GA, parent-infant relationship, and child characteristics. 
Results: Overall, children with higher GA had more friends, spent more time with friends, 
and were more accepted by peers at 6 years of age. Better parent-infant relationships, higher 
cognitive abilities, and fewer motor and behavioral problems predicted more friendships and 
higher peer acceptance after adjusting for sex, socioeconomic status, multiples, siblings, and 
special schooling. Across all GA groups, number of friends (child report: mean change: 1.77, 
95% CI [1.57-1.96]) and peer acceptance (child report: 0.14, [0.09-0.19]; parent report: 0.14, 
[0.11-0.17]) increased with age, but the increase in number of friends was higher among 
preterm children (i.e., interaction effect age*GA group: p = .034). 
Conclusions: Our results provide evidence of a dose-response effect of low GA on 
children’s friendships and perceived peer acceptance. Improvements in early parenting and 
motor, cognitive, and behavioral development may facilitate friendships and peer acceptance 
for all children across the gestation spectrum. 
  
 Friendships and children born at neonatal risk  
4 
 
Children’s peer relationships are crucial for their emotional, cognitive, and social 
development (1). Having close, dyadic friendships and being well-accepted by the peer 
group facilitates life span mental health, behavioral, and academic outcomes (2-6), and 
protects against peer victimization (7). 
Children born very preterm (VP; < 32 weeks gestational age [GA]) are at increased 
risk of poor social adjustment (8). Compared with term born peers, VP children more often 
experience peer relationship problems and social isolation (9-15), and differences persist into 
adulthood (16, 17). Although social difficulties are well documented for VP / very low birth 
weight (< 1500 g) individuals, few studies have investigated the social adjustment of 
moderately to late preterm children (32-36 weeks GA) (18-22). Some have reported more 
internalizing problems, including social withdrawal (20, 21), whereas others did not (18, 22). 
There is considerable uncertainty whether VP children’s peer relationship problems extend 
across the whole gestation spectrum (8), as has been found for cognitive difficulties (23). 
Additionally, past studies mainly investigated the broader domain of peer relationships in VP 
children using subscales of screening questionnaires, and these were often limited to parent 
and teacher reports in childhood (9, 14). Little attention has been paid to children’s own 
perceptions of friendships and their quality. 
Some studies reported that VP children’s social difficulties are related to their 
cognitive and neuromotor deficits (12, 24), but others found differences after accounting for 
cognitive or neurosensory impairments (10, 14, 25). Some authors suggest that multiple risk 
factors such as biological conditions (e.g., brain alterations, poor somatic growth), early life 
stress (e.g., neonatal pain), social experiences (e.g., parent-infant attachment), and 
individual child characteristics (e.g., minor motor and visual difficulties, impaired cognitive 
functions, poor social skills, and early behavioral problems) may contribute to preterm 
children’s vulnerability in social contexts (12, 14, 26, 27). Furthermore, it is uncertain whether 
entering school provides an opportunity for preterm children to make more friends or whether 
it may increase the risk of adverse peer relationships (28). Overall, the origins and underlying 
 Friendships and children born at neonatal risk  
5 
 
mechanisms of preterm children’s social relationship problems are still poorly understood 
(24). 
In this study, we investigated children’s friendships and perceived peer acceptance 
across the total spectrum of GA at 6 years of age (before school entry) and at 8 years of age 
using child and parent reports. First, we expected to find a dose-response effect of GA, that 
is, children with higher GA would have more friendships and higher perceived peer 
acceptance, irrespective of whether reported by children or parents. Second, we investigated 
whether parent-infant relationship as well as child characteristics such as height, motor 
impairment, cognitive ability, and behavioral problems independently predict number and 
frequency of meeting friends, and perceived peer acceptance at 6 and 8 years of age. Third, 
we explored whether friendships and perceived peer acceptance improved or deteriorated 
from preschool to second grade (6 to 8 years of age). 
Methods 
Participants 
Child and parent reports were obtained from the Bavarian Longitudinal Study, a 
geographically defined population-based sample of neonatal at-risk children who were born 
in 1985 and 1986 in Southern Bavaria (Germany). There were 7505 children admitted to a 
children’s hospital within the first 10 days after birth (10.6% of all live births) and 916 healthy 
control children born after 36 weeks GA were recruited (29). Only children whose parents 
had given written informed consent were included. Details of the sampling criteria, design, 
and dropout rates have been previously described (30-32). Of the initial sample (N = 8421), 
1513 children were selected and followed up at 6 and 8 years of age. Children born post-
term (> 41 weeks GA; n = 41) were excluded because previous findings suggest an elevated 
risk for adverse developmental outcomes (33). Only participants with complete assessments 
were included in the current study (n = 1147 [75.8%]; gestation range: 25-41 weeks). Of 
these, 179 were VP, 231 were healthy full-term (FT) control children born between 39 and 41 
weeks of gestation (no neonatal risk), and 737 were born between 32 and 41 weeks GA 
(randomly selected and stratified according to sex, family socioeconomic status [SES], and 
 Friendships and children born at neonatal risk  
6 
 
degree of neonatal risk). Participating children born preterm did not suffer from major 
neurodevelopmental impairments. In case children were born as multiples, all living, same-
aged siblings were included in the follow-up assessments and analyses. The study was 
approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Munich Children’s Hospital and the 
Bavarian Health Council (Landesärztekammer). 
Measures 
Biological and medical variables at birth. GA, birth weight, and sex were obtained 
from obstetric records. 
Parent-infant relationship during the 5 months after birth. Parent-infant 
relationships were assessed with a standard parent interview and study nurses’ 
observations. Eight items measuring attachment-related parental feelings and concerns, and 
relationship problems were evaluated (Table 1; online) and summed into the Parent-Infant 
Relationship Index score ranging from 0 to 8 with greater values indicating poorer parent-
infant relationship. Study nurses were trained to ensure the reliability and validity of 
observations (32). 
Sociodemographic variables at birth, 6, and 8 years of age. Family SES at birth 
was coded into three categories based on maternal and paternal highest education and 
occupation (low, middle, high) (39). Children were grouped by having living multiples (0 = no 
or dead multiples, 1 = living twin or multiples) at 6 years of age. Additionally, the number of 
siblings living in the same household at 6 years of age (0 to 7; including multiples) and 
whether children received special schooling at 8 years of age (0 = no, 1 = yes) was 
assessed. 
Child characteristics at 6 years of age. Children’s height (in cm) was measured by 
specially trained research nurses. A German version of the Test of Motor Impairment - 
Henderson Revision (40) was used to assess motor impairment with eight tasks. Children’s 
general cognitive ability (IQ) was assessed with the German version of the Kaufman - 
Assessment Battery for Children mental processing composite score (41, 42). The German 
 Friendships and children born at neonatal risk  
7 
 
version of the Child Behavior Checklist (43) was used to measure children’s behavioral 
problems with 113 items that were summed into one Total problems score. 
Children’s friendships at 6 and 8 years of age. Child report. The semi-structured 
Friendship and Family Interview (34, 35) was used to assess the nature of children’s 
friendships before children had entered elementary school at 6 years of age (7% had been in 
school for less than three months) and toward the end of second grade at 8 years of age. 
Children were asked to name up to ten playmates or friends (siblings not included). These 
listed friends were summed into a Number of friends index score. For the first five of these 
friends (or fewer, depending on the number listed) children were asked to give information 
about ages and how often they met their friends (Table 1; online). Responses about ages of 
friends were counted across friends and grouped to obtain a Number of older, same age, 
and younger friends index score, respectively. The Frequency of meeting friends index score 
was calculated by averaging responses across friends. Interviewers were trained over two 
months. All interviews were videotaped and double-rated by two psychologists. Interrater-
reliability was excellent with a Cohen kappa of > 0.95. 
Parent report. To assess parents’ perceptions of their children’s friendships at 6 and 
8 years of age, the structured Mannheimer Parent Interview (36), subsection Contact with 
peers, was administered. Parents were instructed to list up to eight friends including sex, 
age, and meeting frequencies (Table 1; online). The same index scores as those for the child 
reports were calculated (i.e., number of friends; number of older, same age, and younger 
friends; frequency of meeting friends). Interviewers were trained to > 95% agreement as 
described. 
Perceived peer acceptance at 6 and 8 years of age. Child report. An adapted 
German version of the Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance for 
Young Children (37, 38), subscale Peer acceptance, was administered. The scale contains 
six items that are each presented via two pictures displaying a sex-matched child. Children 
have to select which of the two children is most like them and responses are coded on a 
four-point scale with greater values indicating higher acceptance (Table 1; online). The six 
 Friendships and children born at neonatal risk  
8 
 
items are averaged into a Perceived peer acceptance index score. Internal consistency was 
acceptable (α = 0.71 at 6 years of age, α = 0.72 at 8 years of age). 
Parent report. Parents answered a parallel version of these items, reformulated into 
questions (Table 1; online). Internal consistency was α = 0.75 and α = 0.79, respectively. 
Statistical analysis 
Data were analyzed using SPSS 24.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, IBM Corp, 
Armonk, New York). Mean values and frequencies are reported by GA group (VP: < 32 
weeks GA; moderately preterm: 32-33 weeks GA; late preterm: 34-36 weeks GA; early term: 
37-38 weeks GA; FT [including both neonatal at-risk and healthy children]: 39-41 weeks GA). 
Interview items were coded zero in case a child had no friends (i.e., 0 = no friend; no older, 
same age, or younger friend; never meets friends; Table 1; online). The Frequency of 
meeting friends index scores were all z-standardized separately for child and parent reports 
according to the healthy FT control children in the sample (n = 231). This standardization 
allowed a direct comparison of children’s and parents’ responses on the different 
instruments. Analyses were adjusted for children’s school entry status at 6 years of age (93% 
had not yet started school). Missing data in parent-infant relationship scores and child 
characteristics (0.10% in total) were imputed. The alpha level was set at p < .05 and two-
tailed for all analyses. To avoid inflation of type 1 error, multiple comparisons between GA 
groups were adjusted using the Bonferroni correction. 
Multiple regressions were computed to determine the relative impact of GA (25 to 41 
weeks), parent-infant relationship neonatally, and child characteristics at 6 years of age on 
number of friends, frequency of meeting friends, and perceived peer acceptance. All 
regression models were adjusted for potential confounders (sex, SES, multiples and siblings 
at 6 years of age, and special schooling at 8 years of age, respectively). To investigate 
changes from 6 to 8 years of age in friendships and perceived peer acceptance, mixed 
design two-way ANCOVAs were run with age as within-subjects factor and GA group as 
between-subjects factor.

Sample description 
 
Table 2 shows children’s descriptive characteristics according to GA groups. VP 
children were more often male and enrolled in a special school. Family SES, number of 
siblings, and having living multiples differed between GA groups. Lower GA at birth was 
associated with poorer parent-infant relationships, smaller stature, lower cognitive ability, 
greater motor impairments, and higher behavior problem scores at 6 years of age. 
Children’s friendships and perceived peer acceptance at 6 and 8 years of age 
 
Tables 3 and 4 show children’s friendships and perceived peer acceptance according 
to GA groups separately for child and parent reports. At 6 years of age, children with higher 
GA had more friends (child and parent reports) and spent more time with friends (child 
report). Age of friends differed significantly between GA groups, but there was no clear dose-
response effect of GA at birth. According to parent reports, perceived peer acceptance was 
higher for children with higher GA at 6 years of age, but not at 8 years of age. At 8 years of 
age, children with higher GA had more friends (parent report) and spent more time with 
friends (child report). 
Multiple regression models revealed that the associations diminished after adjusting 
for child’s sex, SES, multiples and siblings at 6 years of age, and special schooling at 8 years 
of age, but remained significant, except for parent-reported number of friends at 8 years of 
age (Table 5; online). Overall, correlations between child and parent report were small to 
medium (Table 6; online). 
Early social experiences, child characteristics and children’s friendships, and 
perceived peer acceptance 
Multiple regression models showed that early parent-infant relationship and child 
motor, cognitive, and behavioral development at 6 years of age predicted friendships and 
perceived peer acceptance (Table 7; online). The pattern of associations differed depending 
on whether reported by children or parents (Figure 1). Specifically, higher cognitive abilities 
and fewer motor impairments most consistently predicted child reports of better friendships 
and higher perceived peer acceptance at 6 and 8 years of age. Across the board, parent 
 Friendships and children born at neonatal risk  
10 
 
reports of better friendships and higher perceived peer acceptance were explained by a 
better parent-infant relationship, and fewer behavioral problems and motor impairments. 
Changes in children’s friendships and perceived peer acceptance from preschool to 
school age 
Number of friends increased from 6 to 8 years of age across all GA groups as 
reported by children (mean change: 1.77, 95% CI [1.57, 1.96]), but not by parents. This 
increase in number of friends was higher among preterm children (i.e., interaction effect of 
age with GA group, F[4, 1141] = 2.62, p = .034) compared with FT children (Tables 3 and 4 
and Figure 2; online). The frequency of meeting friends did not change from 6 to 8 years of 
age irrespective of whether reported by children or parents. There were also no differences 
in changes between GA groups. Perceived peer acceptance increased from 6 to 8 years of 
age across all GA groups as consistently reported by children (mean change: 0.14, 95% CI 
[0.09, 0.19]) and parents (mean change: 0.14, 95% CI [0.11, 0.17]). There were no 
significant differences in changes between GA groups. 
Discussion 
We investigated the effects of GA across the entire spectrum on children’s friendships 
and perceived peer acceptance at 6 and 8 years of age, and identified early social 
experiences and child characteristics as main predictors of friendships. 
We found that children with higher GA had more friends as consistently reported by 
children and parents, spent more time with friends, and were more accepted by peers at 6 
years of age. This is consistent with findings of previous studies reporting more peer 
problems and social withdrawal in 5- to 6-year-old VP children (9, 13-15, 25). Additionally, 
our results extend previous findings on moderately to late preterm children (20, 21) indicating 
that friendship and peer problems are also more prevalent after moderately to late preterm 
birth. In contrast, at 8 years of age, the effects of GA on number of friends and perceived 
peer acceptance diminished, which is in line with previous findings on preterm adolescents 
(46, 47), and suggests that with the transition into elementary school most preterm children 
may partly catch up with their FT peers. Nevertheless, particularly VP children still 
 Friendships and children born at neonatal risk  
11 
 
experience disadvantages, including fewer time spent with their friends. Overall, preterm 
children themselves felt accepted by their peer group despite having fewer friends and 
spending less time with them than FT peers. There is recent evidence that number of friends 
is related to poor health-related quality of life in VP adults (48). Unknown is whether the 
perception of being accepted in childhood may positively affect later quality of life. This 
requires further prospective research. Previous findings on preterm children’s peer 
relationships in early elementary school are somewhat conflicting. Some studies found 
persisting peer problems in 7- to 8-year-old extremely preterm children (< 28 weeks GA) (10, 
12), even after adjusting for potential confounders, although other studies on VP children did 
not (11). In line with previous findings (46), our results provide evidence that not all areas of 
peer functioning may be equally affected and that degree of prematurity and age may be 
critical. Extremely preterm children in particular may be likely to experience peer problems 
(8), but were underrepresented in this sample (n = 19). 
It is important to identify those children who are at greatest risk of peer relationship 
difficulties given the adverse impacts on later adjustment (5, 49). We identified child 
characteristics as well as quality of parent-infant relationship as independent predictors of 
children’s friendships and perceived peer acceptance. In particular, we found that better 
motor and cognitive abilities predicted having more friends and spending more time with 
friends according to child reports, whereas parents reported better friendship relationships if 
children had fewer motor impairments and additionally fewer behavioral problems. Thus, 
parents’ judgments were based more on observable functioning. Accordingly, it has been 
shown that children with motor or cognitive impairments experience more peer problems and 
have limited access to peer activities, which may challenge their future social development 
(50-52). Children with motor difficulties are more likely to avoid social situations and physical 
activities owing to anxiety, which may prevent them from making contact with peers and 
forming friendships (51). Moreover, lower cognitive ability has been associated with 
difficulties in developing social skills (27, 53). Finally, better parent-infant relationships also 
predicted having more friends at 8 years of age and being more accepted at 6 years of age, 
 Friendships and children born at neonatal risk  
12 
 
according to parent reports. Thus, in addition to functional deficits, our findings support the 
importance of parent-infant relationship quality for children’s peer relationships consistent 
with previous findings (54). It is commonly suggested that relationship patterns and social 
skills experienced in the family environment are likely transferred to the peer context (55). 
Risk factors for poor peer acceptance were characteristics that are observable by 
peers such as motor impairments, behavior problems, and tall stature. Indeed, certain social 
problem behaviors are considered as potential risk factors for peer relationship difficulties 
when displayed in interpersonal contexts (56). Aggressive, disruptive, anxious, or withdrawal 
behavior in social interactions may be perceived as inappropriate or signal vulnerability to 
peers and is, therefore, disliked or rejected (5, 49, 57, 58). Thus, our findings indicate that 
preterm children’s more frequent functional limitations in cognitive, behavioral, and motor 
abilities (20, 21, 59-62) may at least in part explain their difficulties with peers. Moreover, tall 
stature may also be a risk factor of being less accepted by peers in elementary school age, 
independent of GA. Stronger boys have been reported more likely to bully others (63), 
although it does not seem to be related to more victimization (24). 
Having living multiples at 6 years of age consistently predicted poorer friendships and 
peer acceptance at 6 and 8 years of age. In contrast, effects of number of siblings were less 
consistent. Twins and higher-order multiples may have an exclusive, close relationship, 
spending a considerable amount of time together (64), which may decrease the necessity of 
social contacts with other same-aged peers. In contrast, relationships with singleton siblings 
may be less intimate (65), which may also affect peer relationships (66). We re-analyzed our 
regression models separately for children having living multiples vs. being singleton at 6 
years of age; however, results did not significantly change and were stable across the two 
groups. 
In line with previous findings (67, 68), our results reveal that friendship networks and 
acceptance by peers increase with the transition into school. Most children have a best 
mutual friend in school, typically make new friends, and also keep some of their preschool 
friends (69). Attending school offers expanding opportunities of social contacts in the 
 Friendships and children born at neonatal risk  
13 
 
classroom and by memberships in extracurricular activities that are not arranged by close 
caregivers (70). However, the increase in number of friends was higher among preterm 
children compared with FT children. Before 6 years of age, almost all children in our sample 
(97%), irrespective of GA, attended child care outside their homes with contact with peers. 
Nevertheless, preterm children’s parents may constrain their vulnerable children’s contact 
with peers before formal school entry, which has been found to affect the number of 
playmates (6). In contrast, preterm children equally participate in leisure activities at early 
school age (71), which may facilitate contact with peers and forming friendships. 
This study has several strengths. We gathered data from a prospective, large, whole-
population sample that was followed longitudinally at 6 and 8 years of age. We investigated 
friendships and peer acceptance across the full range of GA, and adjusted main analyses for 
a range of potential confounders. Comparability of friendship and peer outcomes over time 
was provided by using the same instruments at 6 and 8 years of age. We assessed 
children’s self-perceptions in addition to parent reports. Comparable with previous studies on 
quality of life in preterm individuals (48), we found discrepancies in child- and parent-
perceived friendships and acceptance by peers. Children seem to have a more positive view 
of their social adjustment. In contrast, parents may perceive greater vulnerability in their child 
leading to overestimations of problems (72). However, previous studies showed that parents’ 
judgments were better explained by objective measures of children’s earlier functioning than 
child reports indicating a more realistic perspective of parents (73). 
 
This study also has limitations. First, because the study sample was recruited 
between 1985 and 1986, more contemporary replications of our findings are required. 
Moreover, the growing use of new communication technologies and social networking sites, 
which offer additional opportunities to connect with peers, should be addressed in future 
studies. Second, participants and children who dropped out at follow-up assessments at 6 
years of age differed in biological and child characteristics, which may have led to an 
underestimation of true difficulties in friendships. Third, this study relied on subjective, 
unilateral choices of friends and (self-) perceptions of peer acceptance. Other approaches 
 Friendships and children born at neonatal risk  
14 
 
are the use of sociometric methods in which only reciprocated friendship preferences and 
likings are considered (67). However, sociometric methods are restricted to peer ratings and 
nominations in the classroom, and neglect friendships outside of school (6). In this 
epidemiological study in South Bavaria, children were not in school at 6 years of age and 
went to hundreds of different schools at 8 years of age, which made sociometric 
assessments impossible. Moreover, some studies have emphasized the predictive value of 
children’s self-perceived peer functioning for later adjustment rather than actual peer 
functioning (74). Finally, about 7% of participating children had already started school at 6 
years of age because the scheduling and re-scheduling of assessments led to an average 
assessment age of 6 years 3 months. Therefore, we adjusted regression and longitudinal 
analyses for school entry status. 
 
Our results add to emerging evidence of a dose-response effect of low GA on 
children’s friendships and peer acceptance. It is recommended that preterm children should 
regularly be followed by health professionals to identify problems in peer-related competence 
and behavior early (75). Although most preterm children catch up with their FT peers during 
early elementary school, future interventions to improve friendships and social interaction 
skills should start before school entry to prevent later psychopathology and behavior 
problems (5). However, preterm children’s early social experiences as well as their frequent 
deficits in cognition, behavior, and motor skills may better explain their friendship and peer 
problems than GA per se. Thus, improving early parenting and motor, cognitive, and 
behavioral development may also facilitate friendships and peer acceptance for children 
across the whole gestation spectrum. Multimodal training methods may be particularly 
effective when involving parents, teachers, and classroom settings (76-78).

Standard interview with 
parents and observations 
of study nurses; seven 
neonatal items and one 
item at 5 months of age. 
 
Eight items evaluating attachment-
related parental feelings and 
concerns, and current or anticipated 
relationship problems are answered 
on three- to five-point scales and 
dichotomized (0 = no concern or 
problem, 1 = problem as defined by 
item). 
 
Responses are summed up 
into an index score, ranging 
from 0 (good parent-infant 
relationship) to 8 (poor 
parent-infant relationship). 
Item 1) “Mother has not yet established a 
relationship to the infant.” (mother, neonatal) 
Item 2) “Mother visits the infant one time per week 
/ less on the neonatal ward.” (mother, neonatal) 
Item 3) “Father visits the infant one time per week / 
not at all on the neonatal ward.” (mother or father, 
neonatal) 
Item 4) “Mother feels very insecure with the 
infant’s care at home.” (mother, neonatal) 
Item 5) “Mother shows (very) little pleasure when 
interacting with the infant.” (study nurse, neonatal) 
Item 6) “Father shows (very) little pleasure when 
interacting with the infant.” (study nurse, neonatal) 
Item 7) “The probability of subsequent parent-
infant care problems is rated high.” (study nurse,

years of age. 
 
 
 
Child report 
 
The scale contains six items that are 
each presented via two pictures 
displaying a sex-matched child doing 
a particular activity (e.g., doing a 
jigsaw puzzle). Two statements 
relating to the pictures are read to 
the children (e.g., “the child on the 
left is good at puzzles, but the child

which of the two children is most like 
them and then indicate if the 
selected child is a lot or just a little bit 
like them. Responses are coded on 
a four-point scale with greater values 
indicating higher acceptance. 
Parent report 
 
The same six items as in the child 
version, reformulated into questions 
(parallel version of the described 
items), are answered by parents. 
Responses are coded on a four-point 
scale with greater values indicating 
higher acceptance. 
Responses of the six items 
are averaged into a 
Perceived peer acceptance 
index score, ranging from 1 
to 4. 
Item 1) “How many friends does your child have to 
play with?” 
Item 2) “How often does your child stay overnight 
at his / her friends’ houses?” 
Item 3) “How many friends does your child have to 
play games with?” 
Item 4) “How many friends does your child have to 
play with on the playground?” 
Item 5) “How often do other children ask if your 
child wants to play?” 
Item 6) “How often does your child eat at his / her 
friends’ houses?” 
*Interviewer starts with standard questions, but may ask additional questions to avoid misinterpretations and ensure full understanding. Number of 
best friends, number of friends in same grade, liking of friends, playing venues, and staying overs were also assessed, but not reported here.

Agreement between child self-report and parent report was estimated using Pearson correlation coefficients. Significance tests were all two-tailed 
and adjusted for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction. *** p < .001, ** p < .01, * p < .05. § The Frequency of meeting friends variables were 
all z-standardized according to healthy FT control children (n = 231) because interval scaled response category options were different for child and 
parent reports (see Methods).
