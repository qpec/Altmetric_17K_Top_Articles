Abstract
Background: Comorbidity patterns of childhood infections, atopic diseases, and adverse childhood experiences
(ACE) are related to immune system programming conditions. The aim of this study was to make a step beyond
the hygiene hypothesis and to comprehensively classify these patterns with latent class analysis (LCA). A second
aim was to characterize the classes by associations with immunological, clinical, and sociodemographic variables.
Methods: LCA was applied to data from the CoLaus|PsyCoLaus study (N = 4874, age range 35–82 years) separately
for men and women. It was based on survey information on chickenpox, measles, mumps, rubella, herpes simplex,
pertussis, scarlet fever, hay fever, asthma, eczema, urticaria, drug allergy, interparental violence, parental
maltreatment, and trauma in early childhood. Subsequently, we examined how immune-mediated classes were
reflected in leukocyte counts, inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, hsCRP), chronic inflammatory diseases, and
mental disorders, and how they differed across social classes and birth cohorts.
Results: LCA results with five classes were selected for further analysis. Latent classes were similar in both sexes and
were labeled according to their associations as neutral, resilient, atopic, mixed (comprising infectious and atopic
diseases), and ACE class. They came across with specific differences in biomarker levels. Mental disorders typically
displayed increased lifetime prevalence rates in the atopic, the mixed, and the ACE classes, and decreased rates in
the resilient class. The same patterns were apparent in chronic inflammatory diseases, except that the ACE class was
relevant specifically in women but not in men.
Conclusions: This is the first study to systematically determine immune-mediated classes that evolve early in life.
They display characteristic associations with biomarker levels and somatic and psychiatric diseases occurring later in
life. Moreover, they show different distributions across social classes and allow to better understand the
mechanisms beyond the changes in the prevalence of chronic somatic and psychiatric diseases.

 Introduction
Dense, complex comorbidity networks—diseasomes [1]—
exist both within and across chronic inflammatory dis-
eases, neurodevelopmental/mental disorders, and, as well,
between them and infections and atopic diseases. A sys-
temic understanding of comorbidity networks will open
new avenues to approach the underlying pathological
mechanisms. This study focused on comorbidity patterns
of infectious and atopic diseases usually emerging early in
life. Concepts related to the immune system programming
[2] or to the neonatal window of opportunity [3] suggest
that these comorbidity patterns reflect characteristic, last-
ing, and far-reaching imbalances in the immune system.
Epidemiological research has already addressed im-
mune system programming from different perspectives.
The hygiene [4] or, rather, the “Old Friends” hypothesis
[5] has postulated that continuing or frequent low-level
exposure to a variety of microbial and helminthic patho-
gens (the “Old Friends”) in infancy and early childhood
boosts the immune system while at the same time im-
proves its capacity for inflammation control. Modern
improvements in hygiene levels are believed to have
changed children’s immune system programming pat-
terns and to have contributed to the increasing rates of
atopic diseases. In the same vein, the early development
of a healthy microbiota has been shown to be protective
against atopies [6–8] and to be associated with mental
health across the life course [9].
In addition, adverse childhood experiences (ACE) have
been consistently shown to increase the risk for neuro-
developmental/mental disorders [10–13] and for somatic
diseases [14] across the life course. The proposed mech-
anisms include neuroendocrine [15] as well as immune
processes [16], both with the potential to modify im-
mune system programming in childhood [17–19] and to
seriously impact somatic and mental health [20, 21].
The first aim of this study was to develop an integrated
approach to immune system programming by classifying
comorbidity patterns of childhood infections and atopic
diseases together with ACE. The statistical model was latent
class analysis (LCA); the latent classes will also be referred
to as immune-mediated classes. The second aim was to fur-
ther characterize these immune-mediated classes by white
blood cell (WBC) counts and inflammatory markers as well
as their association patterns with other groups of diseases
and sociodemographic variables. The analyses were strati-
fied by sex. The database came from CoLaus|PsyCoLaus, a
large epidemiological study in Switzerland.
Methods
The CoLaus|PsyCoLaus cohort
CoLaus|PsyCoLaus [22, 23] is a prospective cohort study
designed to study cardiovascular risk factors (CoLaus) and
mental disorders (PsyCoLaus) in the community and to
determine their associations. The baseline investigation
was carried out between 2003 and 2006. For the allocation
of the initial CoLaus sample, the subjects were randomly
selected among the 35- to 75-year-old residents of the city
of Lausanne (Switzerland) according to the civil register
(n = 6734). The survey was conducted in the French lan-
guage. Participation in the psychiatric evaluation was first
confined to 35- to 67-year-olds of the CoLaus sample;
67% of subjects within this age range (n = 3720) agreed to
participate in the PsyCoLaus part.
The first follow-up of CoLaus|PsyCoLaus was con-
ducted between 2009 and 2012. Information on physical
health was obtained from 5064 (75%) of the n = 6734
participants. In the PsyCoLaus subsample, 87% remained
in the study, i.e., 3188 out of the 3673 participants. Par-
ticipants who had missed the psychiatric part of the
baseline examination (including those initially aged 67–
75 years) were given the opportunity to complete it at
follow-up. Therefore, the sample comprising baseline
data from both interviews increased by n = 1154 and
summed to n = 4874 (see overview in Fig. 1).
The Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies
The main survey instrument of PsyCoLaus was the
French version of the semi-structured Diagnostic Inter-
view for Genetic Studies (DIGS) [24, 25]. The DIGS col-
lects information related to common mental disorders
and returns lifetime prevalence information. It includes
also data related to the course and chronology of comor-
bid features, somatic conditions, and a range of develop-
mental and psychosocial risk factors [22]. A French
version [24] of the DIGS [25] was used to assess diag-
nostic information on mental disorders (see below).
The DIGS collects information on a broad spectrum of
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
IV (DSM-IV) Axis I criteria related to mental disorders
and, moreover, on the course and chronology of comorbid
features [25]. The brief phobia section of the DIGS was re-
placed by the corresponding, more extensive, sections of
the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia—
Lifetime and Anxiety Disorder Version (SADS-LA) [26].
This elicited detailed information related to the DSM-IV
criteria for agoraphobia with or without panic attacks, so-
cial phobia, and specific phobias. The DIGS and the
SADS-LA elicit lifetime diagnoses of common mental dis-
orders. Successful inter-rater and test-retest reliability of
the French version of the DIGS have been established for
major mood and psychotic disorders [24] as well as for
substance use and antisocial personality disorders [27].
Similarly, for the anxiety sections of the French version of
the SADS-LA, inter-rater and test-retest reliability are
good [28]. In this analysis, we grouped mental disorders
into five groups: neurodevelopmental, early-onset anxiety
(average age of onset up to 12), late-onset anxiety (average
Ajdacic-Gross et al. BMC Medicine           (2019) 17:75 
Page 2 of 15
 age of onset above 12), mood, and substance use disorders
(see notes to Table 3).
The information on lifetime diagnosis of infections
and somatic conditions was derived using an extended
version of the medical history parts of the DIGS and an
early version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and
Schizophrenia—Lifetime and Anxiety Disorder Version
(SADS-LA) [26] and was based on reporting of the par-
ticipants. The questions were related to ever having been
diagnosed with various infections, diseases of the ner-
vous system, and cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointes-
tinal, metabolic, and dermatological conditions as well
as allergies and hormonal problems. The lifetime preva-
lence of migraine was assessed according to the criteria
of the International Classification of Headache Disorders
(ICHD-II) [29], using the validated French version of the
Diagnostic Interview for Headache Syndromes (DIHS).
For the present analysis, infections (chickenpox, measles,
mumps, rubella, scarlet fever, pertussis, herpes labialis),
atopic diseases (allergic asthma, other asthma, allergic
eczema, other eczema, hay fever, urticaria, drug allergy),
chronic inflammatory diseases (ulcer, irritable bowel syn-
drome, cystitis, acne, psoriasis, plus migraine), and men-
tal disorders were selected. The age range of the sample
implies that very few participants had received any
measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in childhood, as measles
and other vaccination schedules were only introduced
by Swiss health authorities in the 1960s and 1970s and
were used by a minority of children at the beginnings.
Family-related ACE were represented by the following
questions (variables):
� Did your parents fight with each other frequently?
(interparental violence)
� Did your parents ever do anything that frightened
you (like lock you in a closet)? (fear of
maltreatment)
In addition, the information about traumatic experi-
ences in childhood was extracted from the DIGS section
on posttraumatic stress disorder. Potentially traumatiz-
ing events comprised accidents, physical assaults, wit-
nessing murder, violence or death by accident, sexual
abuse, and, without relevance for the present study,
combat and/or war. The age before which the event
must have occurred was 10 years. Socioeconomic status
was assessed using the Hollingshead index [30].
Inflammatory markers and WBC counts
The biomarkers analyzed in this study comprised white
blood cells (WBC) and inflammatory markers (interleu-
kin-1β
(IL-1β),
interleukin-6
(IL-6),
tumor
necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
(hsCRP)). WBC and inflammatory markers were assessed

 in the baseline examination (PsyCoLaus subsample n =
4671) and the inflammatory markers also in the first
follow-up (n = 4057).
Morning venous blood samples were taken from par-
ticipants without current infection and allowed to clot.
For the cytokine measurements, serum was preferred to
plasma, as it has been shown that different anticoagu-
lants may differentially affect absolute cytokine levels
[31]. Serum samples were stored at − 80 °C before as-
sessment and sent on dry ice to the laboratory. Cytokine
levels were measured using a multiplexed particle-based
flow cytometric cytokine assay [32]. Good agreement be-
tween signal and cytokine was found within the assay
range (R2 ≥ 0.99). Lower detection limits (LOD) were 0.2
pg/ml. For concentrations below the LOD, a value of 0.1
pg/ml was assigned.
hsCRP was assessed during baseline and follow-up
physical evaluations using immunoassay and latex HS
(IMMULITE 1000-High, Diagnostic Products Corpor-
ation, LA, CA, USA), with maximum intra- and inter-
batch
coefficients
of
variation
of
1.3%
and
4.6%,
respectively [23]. Subjects with a hsCRP level higher
than 10 mg/l were excluded as such an elevation is likely
to be attributable to acute infection.
WBC counts were performed on an XN-2100 appar-
atus (Sysmex, Horgen, Switzerland) during the first
follow-up of CoLaus. Data was available for 2963 partici-
pants. Participants with/without WBC counts did not
differ as to sex and age; however, the latter had a slightly
lower SES score (3.29 vs. 3.41, p = 0.002). Neutrophils,
lymphocytes,
monocytes,
eosinophils,
and
basophils
were represented as proportions of total leukocytes. The
WBC variables were smoothed (square root, log)—if ap-
propriate—in order to improve the statistical parameters
of the distributions.
In order to combine values from the baseline and the
follow-up measurement, the inflammatory marker values
were transformed to ranks. In a preliminary step, the
ranks were calculated for the participants with both
measurements (by sex and separately for each measure-
ment). In the next step, participants with only one meas-
urement were given the ranks of their neighbors. If
ranks of both measurements were available, the mean
rank was used, otherwise the rank of the available
measurement.
Statistical analysis
LCA has been used in comorbidity analyses both in som-
atic medicine [33–37] and psychiatric research [38–40].
LCA is a person-centered approach to classification, i.e., it
aims to group individuals into homogeneous classes [41,
42]. The classes represent subgroups of individuals based
on similar responses and characteristics.
The LCA in this study was based on variables represent-
ing infectious childhood diseases (chickenpox, measles,
mumps, rubella, herpes simplex, pertussis, scarlet fever),
atopic diseases (hay fever, asthma, eczema, urticaria, drug
allergy), and childhood adversities (interparental violence,
parental maltreatment, trauma in early childhood). LCA
was conducted using Mplus version 7 [43]. To avoid prob-
lems with local maxima, the number of random starts was
set to 2500 for the first step, using the 250 best solutions
in the final calculation. One to six latent class models were
routinely fitted to the data in order to determine the opti-
mal number of latent classes in the final model. We con-
sidered
several
fit
indices:
the
Akaike
information
criterion (AIC), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC),
and the sample size-adjusted BIC (ABIC) and in addition
the Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test (LMR-LRT)
[44]. Typically, we prefer models with a number of classes
between the number suggested by the BIC and the num-
ber suggested by the AIC. The model selection is further-
more determined by the distinction between the classes,
their size, and their theoretical adequacy.
In further analyses, we applied cross-tabulations, ana-
lysis
of
variance (ANOVA),
general
linear
models,
Kruskal-Wallis test, and logistic regression models. Pro-
gramming and this part of the analyses were carried out
with SPSS Statistics (version 23). We explicitly did not
perform adjustment for multiple testing for several rea-
sons. First of all, there are two technical reasons:
� Adjustment for multiple testing is appropriate under
specific conditions including homogeneous items (as
well as large Ns, precise measurements,
homogeneous conditions, etc.); in contrast, the
diseases/disorders we are investigating subsume
heterogeneous conditions and comprise different
subtypes; this applies not only to grouped disorders
but similarly also to most of the specific disorders or
diseases comprised in this study; one part of the
analysis strategy is to prioritize the β-error over the
α-error, that is, to increase the probability to
account for or to detect minor subtypes
� Another part of the analysis strategy is to focus on
pattern recognition, explicitly through the LCA in this
study, but also implicitly in analyses of groups of
markers and disorders; pattern recognition is prioritized
over analysis of single conditions; adjustment for
multiple testing is uncommon in any pattern
recognition analysis such as involving LCA, factor
analysis, and correspondence analysis (see also [45])
Beyond these reasons, there are methodological pros and
cons whether statistical precision could be helpful in crunch-
ing complex issues. We assume that complexity adapted
modeling strategies are currently more urgently needed.

 Results
Table 1 shows the sociodemographic and socioeconomic
characteristics of the sample. The variables used in con-
ducting the LCAs (infections, atopies, ACE) are displayed
in Table 1 with frequencies and univariate distributions.
Similarly, outcome variables (chronic inflammatory dis-
eases, neurodevelopmental/mental disorders) are displayed
in Table 2, whereas the WBC counts and the inflammatory
markers are summarized in Table 3.
Immune-mediated classes derived from LCA
In LCA of infections, atopic diseases, and ACE, the
five-class solution emerged for both sexes as a reason-
able choice balanced in respect of the fit indices (see
Table 4), with a clear substantial differentiation between
the classes and sufficient class sizes, and corroborated
by differentiated association patterns (see below). Com-
pared to the four-class solution, the five-class solution
added the mixed class. The six-class solution was bur-
dened by classes with very small sizes.
The probabilities of each latent class are displayed in Fig. 2
(men) and Fig. 3 (women); the proportions of participants
in the five classes are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The results
were largely congruent for men and women. The largest
class comprised nearly 60% of participants. It was character-
ized by high probabilities regarding common childhood viral
infections
(chickenpox,
measles,
mumps),
but
low
probabilities otherwise. The latter figures marked it as a
baseline or neutral class. The second class comprised about
20% of participants for each sex. It stood out due to extraor-
dinarily low probabilities in chickenpox/measles/mumps.
Regarding other variables, this class displayed similar or
even lower probabilities such as the neutral class. It was pre-
liminarily labeled the resilient class. Classes 3–5 were
smaller classes and included between 4 and 10% of subjects.
Class 3 was characterized by atopic diseases (asthma, hay
fever, eczema, urticaria, drug allergies). The probabilities in
the atopic class as compared to the neutral class were lower
regarding
chickenpox/measles/mumps
in
women
and
mumps in men. Class 4 displayed increased probabilities of
herpes labialis (fever blisters, i.e., herpes simplex) and child-
hood diseases other than chickenpox/measles/mumps (scar-
let fever, pertussis, rubella). In addition, class 4 shared high
probabilities in both eczema variables and in drug allergies.
It was preliminarily labeled the mixed class. With respect to
chickenpox/measles/mumps, the probabilities were lower in
measles and mumps (men) as well as in mumps (women).
Finally, class 5 was determined by ACE (men and women)
and traumatic experiences in childhood (women). The fur-
ther features of the ACE class entailed enhanced probabil-
ities of herpes infections and hay fever (both sexes) and, in
women, enhanced probabilities in other atopies. The ACE
class displayed lower probabilities of measles and mumps
(men) and of chickenpox/measles/mumps (women).

 Immune-mediated classes differ regarding socioeconomic
and sociodemographic features
The size of each of the five classes was largely congruent in
men and in women (Table 5, Figs. 4 and 5 (see overall
values)). However, marked differences between the classes
became apparent regarding socioeconomic status. The atopic
and the mixed classes were consistently characterized by
high average scores of the Hollingshead index in both sexes,
and the ACE class (in men, also the resilient class) by low
scores (see Table 1; in one-way ANOVAs p < 0.001).
In both sexes, the mean age was distinctly lower in the
atopic and the ACE classes than in the other classes. In
order to gain insight into the historical change, a median
split across the birth cohorts born in 1954 was applied
(Figs. 4 and 5). The atopic and the ACE classes turned
out to be more prominent in younger birth cohorts. In

horts) yielded 15.3 (d.f. 4, p = 0.004) in men and 18.4
(d.f. 4, p = 0.001) in women.
Immune-mediated classes differ regarding WBC counts
and inflammatory markers
Analyses of WBC counts (Fig. 6) with ANOVA returned as
expected an increased proportion of eosinophils in the
atopic class (class 3) both in men and women. In addition,
in women, the overall leucocyte count was increased in the
ACE class.
Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied to ranked data of in-
flammatory markers IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and hsCRP
(Fig. 7). In men, the atopic and the mixed classes con-
sistently displayed lower rank means than the other clas-
ses. IL-1β was particularly high in the ACE class, but
low in the mixed class—even lower than in the atopic
class.
In
contrast
to
men,
the
results
of
the
Kruskal-Wallis tests were not revealing in women.

 immune-mediated
classes.
Several
patterns
became
apparent in the integrated perspective. The resilient
class showed no (positive) associations with any of
the conditions except with ulcer in men. This is a
contrast to the atopic and the mixed classes, which
had (positive) associations with several other condi-
tions both in men and in women. The ACE class
showed an additional pattern: associations with som-
atic conditions were prominent in women, whereas
no associations were apparent in men. Thus, another
aspect of sexual dimorphism becomes visible apart
from inflammatory markers.
Additionally, sexual dimorphism is reflected on the level
of specific disorders, i.e., migraine (in men associated with
the mixed class in addition to the atopic class) apart from
ulcer (see above). In contrast, irritable bowel syndrome
and cystitis were similarly associated with the atopic and
the mixed classes, and acne with the mixed class in men
and in women. Psoriasis was the only disease without re-
vealing associations with any of the classes.
The association patterns between the classes and major
groups
of
neurodevelopmental/mental
disorders
(see
Table 7) were basically similar to the somatic conditions.
Sharing the resilient class yielded a consistent preventive
effect against neurodevelopmental/mental disorders. In
contrast, the ACE class was consistently positively associ-
ated with the latter—now, not only in women but also in
men.

 heterogeneous
associations
with
neurodevelopmental/
mental disorders which also varied by sex. The associa-
tions were strongest in the ACE class (ORs typically
ranged 2–4), followed by the mixed class (1.5–2) and the
atopic class (1–1.5).
Discussion
This is the first study to comprehensively determine
immune-mediated classes that evolve early in life. LCA
was applied on childhood infections, atopic diseases, and
ACE which can be linked with immune system program-
ming in childhood [2]. LCA determined five congruent
classes in men and in women labeled according to the
captured associations as neutral, resilient, atopic, mixed,
and ACE classes. Further analyses aiming to describe
these immune-mediated classes showed characteristic
changes in WBC counts and inflammatory markers. In
addition, the atopic, the mixed, and the ACE classes typ-
ically displayed positive associations with chronic inflam-
matory
diseases
and
neurodevelopmental/mental
disorders, whereas the resilient class emerged with
mostly negative associations, i.e., suggesting a protective
relation. The classes differed with respect to socioeco-
nomic status and birth cohort. The following paragraphs
will discuss the most important patterns and findings.
Characterizing the immune-mediated classes
The five classes derived from PsyCoLaus data represent
the maximum solution which is appropriate with this data
set. For theoretical reasons (e.g., heterogeneity of asthma
and other atopic diseases) and for empirical reasons (e.g.,
no associations involving psoriasis in this study), a higher
number of classes would be expected, but could not be
achieved due to the limitations of the sample size, the
variable configuration, and the statistical model.
The neutral class with more than a half of all subjects
was considered as the baseline class. This implied that
all other classes separate from the neutral class during
development. The latter provided the baseline preva-
lence rates of childhood infections and atopies and the
reference
class
for
further
analyses.
While
most
prevalence rates of childhood infections and atopic dis-
eases were low in this class, the rates of chickenpox,
measles, and mumps were particularly high, thus signal-
ing the absence of any extraordinary immune system ac-
tivity. Subjects pertaining to the neutral class displayed
low prevalence rates in chronic inflammatory diseases
and neurodevelopmental/mental disorders.
The resilient class shared core features with the neu-
tral class such as the low prevalence rates of childhood
infections and atopies. However, it displayed outstand-
ingly low rates with respect to chickenpox, measles, and
mumps. This was particularly noteworthy, given the high
infectiousness of chickenpox and measles, as well as
their seroprevalence of antibodies and reporting rates of
above 90% before the start of vaccination campaigns in
the 1960s and 1970s. Another outstanding feature of this
class and a potential clue to its interpretation was the
positive association with ulcer (men). Helicobacter pyl-
ori, the most important risk factor in ulcer [46, 47], is
one of the “Old Friends” within the framework of the
hygiene hypothesis [4], thus indicating that the resilient
class in fact represents the “Old Friends” class. On the
outcome side, this class was related to consistently lower
risk regarding all groups of mental disorders, both in
men and in women. This is in agreement with the hy-
giene hypothesis which postulated that microbial and
helminthic pathogens (the “Old Friends”) encountered
in infancy and early childhood can train the immune
system and improve its capacity for inflammation con-
trol and thus decrease the susceptibility for depression
and other mental disorders [9, 48].
The atopic, the mixed, and the ACE classes were
marked by increased risk for chronic inflammatory dis-
eases and neurodevelopmental/mental disorders. Obvi-
ously,
the
atopic
class
was
characterized
by
high
probabilities for all atopies. The proportion of eosinophils
in WBC counts was increased, whereas, in men, the levels
of inflammatory markers were consistently lower than
those in other classes. The atopic class included enhanced
risk for irritable bowel syndrome, cystitis, and migraine
[49]. It was associated with mental disorders both in boys/

 men and in girls/women. This is in line with a large
amount of comorbidity studies reporting associations be-
tween atopic diseases and neurodevelopmental/mental
disorders [50–61].
The mixed class revealed an additional and new per-
spective, while all other classes could have been hypoth-
esized in advance based on available research results. It
relied on a mix of specific atopies (eczema, drug
allergies), childhood infections other than chickenpox/
measles/mumps, and herpes simplex (herpes labialis),
which is also typically a childhood infection. Similar to
the atopic class, the mixed class showed lower levels of
inflammatory markers in men, however, intriguingly no
increase of eosinophil counts. Another parallel with the
atopic class derived from the associations with socioeco-
nomic status: both classes were more prevalent in the

 middle and upper classes than in the lower classes (for
the atopic class, see [62]). Members of this class had in-
creased risk for irritable bowel syndrome, cystitis, acne,
and migraine (men). Compared to the atopic class, the
mixed class displayed overall higher ORs for neurodeve-
lopmental/mental disorders.
Among all classes, as an expected finding, the ACE
class showed the highest associations with neurodeve-
lopmental/mental disorders. Apart from that, there was
a multitude of interferences with somatic conditions:
childhood infections (lower reporting of chickenpox/
measles/mumps), atopies (higher frequencies of hay
fever, and, in women, other atopic diseases), chronic in-
flammatory diseases (only women). The latter finding
suggests that ACE trigger stronger imbalances of the im-
mune system in girls/women than in boys/men.
Implications for changing incidence/prevalence rates of
atopic diseases and mental disorders
The increase in prevalence rates of asthma and other
atopic diseases has been a major issue in public health
in recent years. This increase is assumed to have been
most accelerated between the 1960s and 1990s [63], and
there is evidence that it was stronger in girls/women
than in boys/men [64]. A similar discussion has taken
place in public mental health regarding increasing rates
of depression [9, 65]. The present analysis provides a
new perspective for these discussions by comparing the
changes within the classes across birth cohorts. As ex-
pected, we found a higher proportion of the atopic class
in younger birth cohorts, which occurred at the expense
of
the
resilient
class
and
the
mixed
class.
The
consequences must be more complex than outlined by
the “Old Friends” hypothesis. While the changes within
the atopic and the resilient classes together contribute to
an increasing risk for chronic inflammatory diseases and
neurodevelopmental/mental disorders, this shift is coun-
terbalanced by a decrease in risk for diseases associated
with the mixed class.
Time of onset of childhood infections and timing issues
The interplay between the neutral class and chickenpox/
measles/mumps provides a suggestion to understand the
timing, when immune-mediated classes separate from
the neutral class. Chickenpox/measles/mumps are ex-
pected to yield seroprevalence rates of antibodies and
reporting rates of about 90% under unambiguous condi-
tions before the start of vaccination campaigns in the
1960s and 1970s. Such reporting rates were consistently
present in the neutral class but not in the other classes.
Therefore, lower chickenpox/measles/mumps probabil-
ities are presumed to signal some specific immune sys-
tem activity limiting or influencing the duration and
manifestation of chickenpox/measles/mumps infections.
Furthermore,
chickenpox/measles/mumps
and
other
childhood infections with self-reported age of onset be-
tween 6 and 8 years [66] provide preliminary reference
time points (in comparison with that: pertussis 6.5 years,
rubella and scarlet fever 7.5 years; these data represent
the upper age limits due to telescoping effects in report-
ing remote events (see also reference [67])).
By far, the lowest probabilities in chickenpox/measles/
mumps compared to the neutral class emerged in the re-
silient class. Research on the “Old Friends” and the

 microbiota hypothesis has suggested that the resilient
class might emerge as early as during the neonatal
period [3, 68]. Marked deviations from the neutral class
pattern also occurred in the ACE and the atopic classes
in women, therefore raising the question whether these
classes evolve at an earlier age in girls than in boys. Still,
the mixed class (both sexes) and the ACE and atopic
classes in men displayed lowered probability of mumps
which means that they at least started to evolve at the
same age as the age of mumps onset.
The differentiation of immune-mediated classes might
end by adolescence, as indicated by migration studies in
multiple sclerosis [69] and in depression [9]. Many fur-
ther questions might be open to debate, e.g., are class
changes and different sequences of class membership
possible? If yes, how do they take place and what con-
version probabilities do they comprise? Findings suggest-
ing that low-level microbial exposure in infancy is
protective against the negative outcomes of psychosocial
stress such as increased CRP levels [65, 70] at least shed
some light on the resilient class.
Strengths and weaknesses
The immune-mediated classes yield many new perspec-
tives that could not be discussed in more detail due to
space constraints. Research on complex and heteroge-
neous issues such as the interrelations between the im-
mune
system,
chronic
inflammatory
diseases,
and
mental disorders requires a comprehensive data back-
ground and appropriate analytical approaches. The LCA
served pattern recognition and provided us with more
details than variable-oriented models would have done.
However, LCA delivers exclusive classes, which is a
simplification of the reality in most instances. LCA
strongly depends on data input, selection of variables,
sample sizes, and other limitations of the study. The
analysis included only infectious and atopic diseases,
chronic inflammatory diseases, and neurodevelopmen-
tal/mental disorders with sufficient frequencies (n > 50
in each sex) in the CoLaus|PsyCoLaus study. The
CoLaus|PsyCoLaus study comprises only a limited num-
ber of variables covering psychosocial adversities. We
cannot
exclude
the
possibility
that
additional
immune-mediated classes exist. Many subtypes of im-
portant chronic diseases and neurodevelopmental/men-
tal disorders probably could not be covered by the
classes presented here. For example, several subtypes of
asthma are known [71], but they were not mirrored in
the current analysis.
In addition, the range of inflammatory markers that
served to characterize the classes was limited. The selec-
tion focused on markers that were intensively discussed
at the beginning of the study in the early 2000 years. In
the meantime, the range of inflammatory markers of
interest has grown and includes both anti-inflammatory
markers (e.g., IL-10) and pro-inflammatory markers
(e.g., IL-8, IL-23). It is left to subsequent studies to
examine their interplay in the different classes.
This study shares further common limitations of stud-
ies based on self-reporting data, including recall bias and
telescoping effects [67]. In PsyCoLaus, many infections
and pathogens of interest were not comprised in data
due to limitations of self-reporting. Regarding adverse
experiences and stigmatized issues, underreporting is
probable and results in underestimation of statistical ef-
fects. Using groupings of neurodevelopmental/mental
disorders, as well as chronic inflammatory diseases,
which typically subsume different subtypes, has a further
smoothing influence on statistical effects.
Conclusions
Associations between childhood infections, atopic dis-
eases, and adverse childhood experiences reveal a system
of immune-mediated classes that incorporates and goes
beyond the resilient (or “Old Friends”) class related to
the hygiene hypothesis. The immune-mediated classes
consolidate during the first years of life. Sharing a spe-
cific immune-mediated class different from the neutral
class (resilient, atopic, mixed, or ACE class) modifies the
risk for most chronic inflammatory diseases and neuro-
developmental/mental disorders. In particular, the mixed
class emerged as a new and unanticipated issue. A better
understanding of the immune-mediated classes provides
a preliminary basis from which to start assessing more
specific immune mechanisms
relevant to particular
chronic
inflammatory
diseases,
neurodevelopmental/
mental disorders, and their subtypes.
