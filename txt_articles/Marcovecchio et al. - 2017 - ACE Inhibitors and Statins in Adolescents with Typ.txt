BACKGROUND
Among adolescents with type 1 diabetes, rapid increases in albumin excretion during 
puberty precede the development of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria, long-term 
risk factors for renal and cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that adolescents with 
high levels of albumin excretion might benefit from angiotensin-converting–enzyme 
(ACE) inhibitors and statins, drugs that have not been fully evaluated in adolescents.
METHODS
We screened 4407 adolescents with type 1 diabetes between the ages of 10 and 16 years 
of age and identified 1287 with values in the upper third of the albumin-to-creatinine 
ratios; 443 were randomly assigned in a placebo-controlled trial of an ACE inhibitor 
and a statin with the use of a 2-by-2 factorial design minimizing differences in baseline 
characteristics such as age, sex, and duration of diabetes. The primary outcome for 
both interventions was the change in albumin excretion, assessed according to the 
albumin-to-creatinine ratio calculated from three early-morning urine samples obtained 
every 6 months over 2 to 4 years, and expressed as the area under the curve. Key sec-
ondary outcomes included the development of microalbuminuria, progression of reti-
nopathy, changes in the glomerular filtration rate, lipid levels, and measures of cardio-
vascular risk (carotid intima–media thickness and levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive 
protein and asymmetric dimethylarginine).
RESULTS
The primary outcome was not affected by ACE inhibitor therapy, statin therapy, or the 
combination of the two. The use of an ACE inhibitor was associated with a lower in-
cidence of microalbuminuria than the use of placebo; in the context of negative find-
ings for the primary outcome and statistical analysis plan, this lower incidence was 
not considered significant (hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.35 to 0.94). 
Statin use resulted in significant reductions in total, low-density lipoprotein, and non–
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, in triglyceride levels, and in the ratio of 
apolipoprotein B to apolipoprotein A1, whereas neither drug had significant effects on 
carotid intima–media thickness, other cardiovascular markers, the glomerular filtra-
tion rate, or progression of retinopathy. Overall adherence to the drug regimen was 
75%, and serious adverse events were similar across the groups.
CONCLUSIONS
The use of an ACE inhibitor and a statin did not change the albumin-to-creatinine 
ratio over time. (Funded by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and others;

C
hildren with type 1 diabetes are at 
higher risk for long-term renal and car-
diovascular disease and death than the 
general population,1,2 and adolescence is a period 
of risk for the development of complications, 
since adequate glycemic control is difficult to 
achieve.3 Rapid increases in albumin excretion 
during puberty precede the development of micro-
albuminuria and macroalbuminuria,4 and these 
changes are associated with dyslipidemia, hyper-
tension, increased levels of high-sensitivity C-reac-
tive protein,5-7 increased aortic and carotid intima–
media thickness,8,9 and altered retinal vasculature.10 
We hypothesized that adolescents with high levels 
of albumin excretion might benefit from angio-
tensin-converting–enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 
statins. These drugs are commonly used in adults 
with type 1 diabetes, but they have not been fully 
evaluated in adolescents.11-15
To identify adolescents with type 1 diabetes 
who were at increased risk for potential compli-
cations, we screened 4407 patients between the 
ages of 10 and 16 years to determine the pres-
ence of increased albumin excretion, which was 
defined as the upper third of the albumin-to-
creatinine ratios on the basis of six early-morning 
urine samples, after adjustment for age, sex, and 
duration of diabetes. There is evidence that such 
adolescents have an increased glomerular filtra-
tion rate, dyslipidemia, and increased arterial 
stiffness, aortic intima–media thickness, and car-
diac autonomic dysfunction.9,16,17 We subsequently 
invited the patients with the highest albumin-to-
creatinine ratios to participate in the Adolescent 
Type 1 Diabetes Cardio-Renal Intervention Trial 
(AdDIT) to evaluate the effects of ACE inhibitors 
and statins.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
From May 2009 through August 2013, we en-
rolled patients in this double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial at 32 centers in three 
countries (the United Kingdom, Canada, and 
Australia). The trial was designed to explore the 
effects of two drugs with very different mecha-
nisms of action in this population of adolescents. 
With the use of a 2-by-2 factorial design, we 
evaluated a variable dose of an ACE inhibitor 
(quinapril at a dose of 5 to 10 mg daily), a fixed 
dose of a statin (atorvastatin at a dose of 10 mg 
daily), and combinations of both or placebo in 
adolescents who were at high risk for complica-
tions of diabetes.18 The lower dose of the ACE 
inhibitor or placebo (5 mg) was initiated and in-
creased to 10 mg daily after 2 weeks. If patients 
had side effects, the dose was reduced to 5 mg 
with a subsequent decision to increase or main-
tain the dose.
The trial sponsor was the University of Cam-
bridge and Cambridge University Hospitals NHS 
Foundation Trust. The funders had no role in the 
design and conduct of the trial or in the collec-
tion, management, analysis, or interpretation of 
the data, but they were given the opportunity to 
comment on the manuscript before submission. 
Pfizer donated the active drugs and the placebos 
for this trial.
The trial conformed to the provisions of the 
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the 
Cambridge University Hospitals and participating 
local research ethics committees. Parents of the 
patients provided written informed consent, and 
the trial patients were asked to provide their 
written assent if they were not yet at an age 
when they could provide consent.
The trial was designed by the principal inves-
tigators, and data were collected by the collabo-
rators listed in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org. All the authors vouch for the com-
pleteness and accuracy of the data and analyses 
and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol 
and statistical analysis plan, both of which are 
available at NEJM.org. The trial statisticians ana-
lyzed the data, the first and last authors drafted 
the manuscript, and the steering committee and 
all authors approved the submission of the manu-
script for publication.
Trial Population
Adolescents with type 1 diabetes were recruited 
from a prescreened population of 4407 patients, 
which included 1287 patients with values in the 
upper third of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio. 
We used the World Health Organization defini-
tion of an adolescent19 as a person between 10 and 
19 years of age, and we assessed Tanner pubertal 
stages. Eligible patients were 10 to 16 years of 
age and had received a diagnosis of diabetes at 
least 1 year earlier (or a diagnosis within the past 
year with an undetectable C-peptide level). All the 
patients had an adjusted albumin-to-creatinine

ratio in the upper third of the screened popula-
tion.4,18 Exclusion criteria were non–type 1 dia-
betes, pregnancy or unwillingness to adhere to 
contraceptive advice and pregnancy testing, severe 
hyperlipidemia or a family history suggesting 
familial hypercholesterolemia, hypertension un-
related to diabetic nephropathy, previous expo-
sure to the investigational drugs, unwillingness 
or inability to adhere to the trial protocol, the 
presence of coexisting conditions (excluding 
treated hypothyroidism and celiac disease), pro-
liferative retinopathy, and the presence of renal 
disease that was not associated with type 1 dia-
betes.18
Trial Procedures
Patients underwent randomization by means of a 
secure 
Internet-based 
service 
(www 
. 
sealedenvelope 
. 
com) to one of four regimens: ACE inhibitor plus 
placebo, statin plus placebo, ACE inhibitor plus 
statin, or placebo plus placebo. Differences in 
baseline characteristics were minimized by cat-
egorizing patients according to glycated hemo-
globin level (<7.5%, 7.5 to 8.5%, or >8.5%), log10 
albumin-to-creatinine ratio (1.2 to 1.7 or >1.7), 
sex, age (11 to 13 years or >13 years), duration 
of type 1 diabetes (<5 years or ≥5 years), total 
cholesterol level (<172.5 mg per deciliter or 
≥172.5 mg per deciliter), and country.18
Adherence
Adherence to the trial regimen was assessed ac-
cording to pill counts of returned unused medi-
cations. To assist in counseling to improve ad-
herence, data were also downloaded from the 
Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS 6 
TrackCap, Aardex). A medication vial cap was 
fitted with a microprocessor, which recorded the 
date and time the cap was opened and closed 
over the course of the trial.20
Trial Assessments
At the baseline visit, height, weight, waist circum-
ference, blood pressure, Tanner pubertal stage, 
smoking status, pregnancy tests, and levels of 
glycated hemoglobin, alanine aminotransferase, 
urea, and electrolytes were assessed. Nonfasting 
blood samples were collected for centralized 
measurements of lipids, including total choles-
terol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and 
non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipopro-
teins (apolipoprotein A1 and apolipoprotein B), 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, asymmetric 
dimethylarginine, creatinine, and cystatin C. Pa-
tients attended designated centers for the mea-
surement of the carotid intima–media thickness.
Patients were seen 1 month after randomiza-
tion and then every 3 months. Every 6 months, 
three early-morning urine samples and blood 
samples were obtained for centralized assessment 
of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and other 
markers as measured at baseline. Anonymized 
digital copies of routine retinal photographs were 
obtained annually.
Final assessments occurred after a minimum of 
2 years and a maximum of 4 years. Assessments 
were identical to the baseline visit. Throughout 
the trial, the physicians were encouraged to strive 
for recommended levels of glycemic control, but 
targets and methods of insulin delivery were not 
stipulated in the protocol.
Biochemical, Cardiovascular, and Retinal 
Assessments
Local laboratories analyzed glycated hemoglobin 
levels and safety data, whereas all other biochem-
ical measurements were performed centrally at 
the WellChild Laboratory, London, as reported 
previously.16 Carotid intima–media thickness was 
measured at 11 specialized vascular centers, with 
centralized analysis by the Vascular Physiology 
Unit at University College London, where train-
ing and quality control were also supervised. 
Retinal photographs were assessed centrally at 
the Centre for Eye Research, Melbourne, Australia 
(see the Supplementary Methods section in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
For patients who were 18 years of age or 
younger, the estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) was calculated on the basis of the creati-
nine level with the use of a modified Schwartz 
equation derived from our previous studies of 
the GFR in type 1 diabetes in which we used 
Inutest as the standard: 0.475 
× 
height (cm)/creati-
nine (mg per deciliter) (Table S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix); for patients who were older 
than 18 years of age, the creatinine-based Chron-
ic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration 
(CKD-EPI) equation was used.21 Given recent 
changes in the evaluation of the GFR, we also 
carried out sensitivity analyses with the esti-
mated GFR calculated by means of the Zapp-
itelli equation in patients who were 18 years of

Efficacy Outcomes
The primary outcome for both factorial compari-
sons was the change in repeated-measures analy-
sis of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio, which was 
assessed according to the area under the curve 
of the log10 albumin-to-creatinine ratio that was 
standardized according to the length of enroll-
ment in the trial.
Many secondary outcomes in the published 
protocol18 were exploratory but considered to be 
clinically relevant in this population of adoles-
cents. Those outcomes that are reported here 
assessed the effects of ACE inhibitors on blood 
pressure, the GFR, and the incidence of microalbu-
minuria, and the effect of statins on lipid levels, 
carotid intima–media thickness, and levels of 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and asymmet-
ric dimethylarginine. Microalbuminuria was de-
fined as an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of more 
than 31.0 mg per gram (3.5 mg per millimole) 
in male patients or more than 35.4 mg per gram 
(4 mg per millimole) in female patients in at 
least two of three early-morning urine samples 
at any trial visit.3 The effects of both drugs on 
two-step and three-step progression of retinopa-
thy were also assessed.
Safety
Safety was assessed by regular monitoring of 
plasma urea and electrolyte levels, the estimated 
GFR, liver function, and changes in height, weight, 
and body-mass index. Girls who had undergone 
menarche received counseling on contraception 
if they were sexually active, as well as pregnancy 
tests every 6 months.
Statistical Analysis
The sample size was based on repeated-measures 
analysis of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio in the 
Oxford Regional Prospective Study cohort, which 
involved 477 patients of a similar age to that in 
our cohort, with a mean of 3.5 annual assess-
ments,3,4 in which the SD of log10 of the albumin-
to-creatinine ratio (area under the curve per year) 
was 0.28. We determined that at 2 to 4 years of 
follow-up, a sample size of 400 (100 patients in 
each group) would provide a power of 93% to 
detect a 25% lower albumin-to-creatinine ratio 
among the patients receiving the ACE inhibitor 
(ACE inhibitor plus placebo and ACE inhibitor 
plus statin [200 patients]) than among those re-
ceiving placebo (placebo plus placebo and statin 
plus placebo [200 patients]) or among the pa-
tients receiving the statin (statin plus placebo and 
ACE inhibitor plus statin [200 patients]) than 
among those receiving placebo (placebo plus pla-
cebo and ACE inhibitor plus placebo [200 pa-
tients]). In 2012, the initial target population of 
500 (based on a dropout rate of 20%) was revised 
to adjust for a potentially smaller population of 
patients undergoing randomization, resulting in 
a target of 440, which provided a power of 92% 
for the primary factorial comparisons. If an inter-
action between the drugs was detected, the trial 
provided a power of 82% to detect a 30% lower 
albumin-to-creatinine ratio among patients re-
ceiving the ACE inhibitor (ACE inhibitor plus 
placebo) or the statin (statin plus placebo) than 
among those receiving placebo (placebo plus 
placebo).
For the primary outcome, the measurements 
of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio on 3 consecu-
tive days every 6 months were aggregated into the 
mean of the three log10-transformed values. Since 
no further urine samples were obtained at ran-
domization, the values at this time point were 
interpolated from those obtained at screening 
and the first visit after randomization. The trap-
ezoidal rule was used to calculate the area under 
the curve of observations obtained at screening 
through those obtained at the final visit with the 
use of calendar dates. The duration of enroll-
ment in the trial was calculated as the difference 
between randomization and the final visit dates 
(after 2 to 4 years) or withdrawal from the trial. 
The area under the curve was divided by the dura-
tion of enrollment to provide a one-time stan-
dardized value per patient.
The primary analysis of the annualized log10 
albumin-to-creatinine ratio area under the curve 
used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model 
to estimate main effects of the two treatments 
after adjustment for the baseline covariates used 
in the minimization algorithm that assigned 
treatment, with assessment of potential interac-
tion between trial drugs. A P value of less than 
0.05 was considered to indicate statistical signifi-
cance with no adjustment for multiplicity, given 
the 2-by-2 trial design. A 1% level of significance 
(P<0.01) was adopted for the secondary out-
comes.

ACE Inhibitors and Statins in Type 1 Diabetes
The time until the first incidence of microal-
buminuria was analyzed as a time-to-event vari-
able with the use of the calendar date on which 
microalbuminuria was observed or with censor-
ing at the final visit if microalbuminuria was 
never observed (patients with microalbuminuria 
at screening were excluded from this analysis). 
Kaplan–Meier survival curves were produced and 
hazard ratios were estimated with the use of a 
Cox proportional-hazards model, with adjustment 
for baseline covariates. The same time-to-event 
analysis and Cox proportional models were used 
to analyze two-step and three-step progression 
of retinopathy (see the Supplementary Methods 
section in the Supplementary Appendix).
Analyses of secondary continuous outcomes 
were performed with an ANCOVA model to esti-
mate main effects of the two treatments after ad-
justment for the baseline covariates. For outcomes 
that were assessed only at baseline and follow-up, 
the final measurement was used as a dependent 
variable in the model. Secondary outcomes are 
provided as means and 95% confidence intervals, 
with grouping categorized according to trial-drug 
groups, and pooling observations taken every 
6 months (±3 months).
Sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome 
were performed to take into account differences 
in adherence among the patients, according to 
the duration of treatment with weighting for the 
percentage of adherence at each visit. The sensi-
tivity analysis was also repeated on the basis of 
the mean rate of adherence alone. R software 
was used for all statistical analyses.
Results
Patients, Follow-up, and Adherence
A total of 443 adolescents underwent random-
ization (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The characteristics of the patients at baseline 
were similar in the four groups (Table 1, and 
Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). At 
recruitment, 3% of the patients were prepuber-
tal, and these patients and the rest of the cohort 
progressed normally through puberty during the 
2-to-4-year follow-up period. The median follow-
up of patients was 2.6 years (range, 0.1 to 4.4), 
and 154 patients completed the maximum 4 years. 
A total of 78 patients (18%) withdrew from the 
trial, with no significant differences in rates of 
withdrawal among the four groups (Fig. S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). The mean overall 
rate of adherence to a trial drug was 75% (Fig. 
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Primary Outcome
There was no significant effect of the ACE in-
hibitor (effect, −0.01; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], −0.05 to 0.03) or statin (effect, 0.01; 95% 
CI, −0.02 to 0.05) on the area under the curve of 
the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (Fig. 1). Only the 
baseline log10 value of the albumin-to-creatinine 
ratio was associated with the area under the 
curve of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio during 
treatment (effect, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.82). 
There was no significant interaction between the 
two trial drugs (effect, 0.04; 95% CI, −0.04 to 
0.12). Sensitivity analyses allowing for different 
levels of drug adherence and duration of treat-
ment did not alter these results (Fig. S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Secondary Outcomes
The use of ACE inhibitors reduced the cumula-
tive incidence of microalbuminuria (P 
= 
0.046 
by the log-rank test) (Fig. 2A), with an adjusted 
hazard ratio of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.94; 
P 
= 
0.03), which in the context of negative find-
ings for the primary outcome and statistical 
analysis plan was not considered significant 
(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Vari-
ability in the albumin-to-creatinine ratios is 
shown in Figure S4 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix. The use of the statin had no effect on 
the incidence of microalbuminuria (adjusted haz-
ard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.58; P 
= 
0.93) 
(Fig. 2B, and Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Statin treatment was associated with lower 
levels of total, LDL, and non-HDL cholesterol, 
triglycerides, and the ratio of apolipoprotein B to 
apolipoprotein A1 (Fig. 3, and Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix), whereas there was no 
significant effect of the ACE inhibitor on lipid 
levels, apart from a nonsignificantly higher HDL 
cholesterol level (Fig. S5 and Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
The use of the ACE inhibitor was associated 
with nonsignificantly lower systolic blood-pressure 
z scores, whereas there was no effect of statins 
on blood pressure (Fig. S6 and Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
There was no significant effect of statins on 
the estimated GFR (Fig. S7 and Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix), whereas cystatin C

levels were consistently lower in the ACE-inhibi-
tor group than in the placebo group (Fig. S7 and 
Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). In all 
the patients in the trial, the level of cystatin C 
decreased over time, suggesting an increased 
GFR, and this was confirmed on post hoc analy-
ses of the estimated GFR as calculated by means 
of the Zappitelli and CKD-EPI creatinine–cystatin 
C equations, which increased over time, although 
there were no differences between the trial-drug 
groups (Fig. S7 and Table S3 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
There were no significant effects of the ACE 
inhibitor or statin on carotid intima–media thick-
ness or the asymmetric dimethylarginine level, 
but statin therapy led to a slight reduction in 
levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Fig. 
S8 and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Retinopathy two-step and three-step progres-
sion was not affected by the ACE inhibitor (Fig. 
S9 and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix), whereas there was nonsignificantly lower 
progression with statin therapy (Fig. S9 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The glycated hemo-
globin level increased over time in all groups 
(Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety
Of the 222 patients who were receiving the ACE 
inhibitor or placebo, 56 (25%) required a dose 
reduction (to 5 mg daily), largely because of 
postural hypotension. However, persistent cough 
was rare, and only 5% of patients continued to 
receive the lower dose at the end of the trial.
Four serious adverse reactions were deemed 
to be related to the ACE inhibitor by the chief 
investigator: a clinically significant decrease in 
the estimated GFR (in two patients), a hypoten-
sive episode (in one patient), and an elevated 
level of alanine aminotransferase (in one patient) 
(Table 2). No serious adverse reactions were 
deemed to be related to statin therapy. Overall, 
there were no significant differences in alanine 
aminotransferase levels in patients who were 
receiving statin therapy and those who were re-
ceiving placebo (Fig. S11 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).

No effects of the trial drugs on height, 
weight, body-mass index, or waist circumference 
were observed (Table S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). No serious unexpected serious adverse 
reactions were reported.
Discussion
Our trial assessed the effects of ACE-inhibitor 
and statin therapy in adolescents with type 1 
diabetes, a group of patients who are difficult to 
recruit into and retain in clinical trials. The use 
of these agents over a period of 2 to 4 years did 
not show any effect on the primary outcome of 
a change in repeated measures of the albumin-
to-creatinine ratio over time. This end point was 
chosen because previous longitudinal studies had 
shown that increases in the albumin-to-creati-
nine ratio during puberty, below the thresholds 
for microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria, 
were associated with risk markers for cardiovas-
cular disease.3,5,7

ACE Inhibitors and Statins in Type 1 Diabetes
The trial was adequately powered to observe 
a 25% lower area under the curve of the albumin-
to-creatinine ratio in the treatment groups than 
in the placebo groups on the basis of published 
data from studies involving adolescents.4 This 
effect size was conservative, according to previ-
ous studies of ACE inhibitors involving adults11 
and a few small studies involving children.12-14 
However, a subsequent study, the Renin–Angio-
tensin System Study (RASS), questioned the effi-
cacy of interventions with ACE inhibitors in pa-
tients who had normal albumin levels,23 and the 
effects of statins on renal function in patients 
with type 1 diabetes are now less certain.24 In 
contrast to the RASS, we observed lower rates of 
progression to microalbuminuria with the ACE 
inhibitor than with placebo, and although this 
finding was not significant, it may be of clinical 
relevance, since it was related to reduced vari-
ability in the albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Recent 
data from the Diabetes Control and Complica-
tions Trial (DCCT) and the follow-up Epidemiol-
ogy of Diabetes Interventions and Complications 
(EDIC) study indicate that even intermittent micro-
albuminuria may predict cardiovascular risk.25
As expected, the use of statins significantly 
reduced lipid levels, and results are consistent 
with those in a recent small trial assessing the 
safety and efficacy of atorvastatin in improving 
lipid profiles in 60 adolescents with type 1 dia-
betes and elevated LDL cholesterol levels.26 Over-
all LDL cholesterol levels were lower than those 
reported in diabetes trials involving adults27 and 
in studies involving children and adolescents with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.28 
However, the lipid levels were similar to those in 
cohorts of adolescents with type 1 diabetes,7,29 in 
which persistently abnormal lipid levels contrib-
ute to long-term cardiovascular risk. The use of 
the ACE inhibitor had little effect on plasma 
lipid levels, although there were nonsignificantly 
higher HDL cholesterol levels, as reported previ-
ously.30 Statins were associated with only a small 
reduction in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein 
levels, but these levels were within the normal 
range at baseline.31 Asymmetric dimethylargi-
nine levels were no different after statin therapy, 
consistent with previous reports.32
We selected carotid intima–media thickness as 
the primary vascular marker in our trial, since it 
is reproducible, noninvasive, and can offer prog-
nostic information on adverse cardiovascular 
outcomes.33 The thickness is higher in children 
and adolescents with type 1 diabetes than in age-
matched healthy children.8 However, in contrast 
to studies involving adolescents with familial 
hypercholesterolemia, carotid intima–media thick-
ness was not affected by the use of statins in our 
trial. One explanation could be that patients 
with familial hypercholesterolemia have been 
exposed to high lipid levels since birth and may 
have greater arterial-wall thickening than age-
matched patients with type 1 diabetes.28,34
Despite the absence of any response with re-
spect to the carotid intima–media thickness in 
our trial, long-term follow-up of the cohort will 
be important to assess whether intervention dur-
ing this critical period of adolescence will result 
in a “legacy effect” similar to that observed after 
previous trials investigating glycemic and lipid 
control.35,36
There was no significant effect of the ACE 
inhibitor on the progression of retinopathy in 
our trial, in contrast to results from previous 
studies involving adults who received enalapril.23 
These differences may relate to the relatively 
early stages of retinopathy in our young popula-
tion, the duration of treatment, or possibly an 
ACE-inhibitor class effect. We observed a trend 
toward lower retinopathy progression with statin 
treatment, although this was less apparent over 
time, possibly reflecting lower numbers of pa-
tients with data on retinopathy or decreased drug 
adherence. There are limited and conflicting 
data on the effect of statins on retinopathy,37 and 
the findings of our trial may support further 
exploration.
Rates of withdrawal and adherence could 
have had an effect in our trial. Whereas dropout 
rates were similar to those predicted (18% vs. 
20%), the rate of adherence (assessed objectively 
with the use of electronic track caps20) was sig-
nificantly higher (>70%) than the rates in other 
adolescent cohorts (50 to 55%).38,39 ACE-inhibitor 
therapy had few side effects, and although the 
drug dose was reduced on many occasions be-
cause of postural hypotension, only 5% of the 
patients were unable to receive the higher dose 
by the end of the trial. Chronic cough was not a 
clinically significant concern, and severe adverse 
reactions were rare. With regard to statin therapy, 
only one patient reported any muscle symptoms 
throughout the trial. Overall complication rates 
with statin therapy were lower than those reported

in adults with and without diabetes,15 and they 
were consistent with the rates in trials involving 
children and adolescents with heterozygous fa-
milial hypercholesterolemia.28 No pregnancies oc-
curred during the trial period, but this potential 
risk remains an issue for the use of ACE inhibi-
tors and statins in adolescents.
Our trial had certain limitations, including the 
relatively short duration of exposure to the trial 
drugs. Predictably, in this population, the mean 
glycated hemoglobin level increased by approxi-
mately 0.5% during the trial period, despite a high 
rate of insulin-pump therapy (50%). It may be 
too soon to determine whether drug therapy may 
have ameliorated the adverse effects of these gly-
cemic exposures. A delayed “legacy effect” of early 
treatment with ACE inhibitors or statins could 
still occur, as reported in other trials of glucose-
lowering, lipid-lowering, or blood-pressure–lower-
ing interventions,35,36,40 in which reduced vascular 
complications emerged beyond the duration of the 
original trials. Follow-up of the present cohort 
will be essential to evaluate the potential bene-
fits of early intervention with ACE inhibitors and 
statins.
In conclusion, neither ACE-inhibitor nor statin 
therapy over a period of 2 to 4 years altered the 
primary outcome of the change in repeated mea-
sures of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio among 
adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
