associated with high dietary advanced glycation

mimic alarmins

The incidence of food allergy has increased dramatically in
the last few decades in westernized developed countries. We
propose that the Western lifestyle and diet promote innate
danger signals and immune responses through production of
‘‘alarmins.’’ Alarmins are endogenous molecules secreted
from cells undergoing nonprogrammed cell death that signal
tissue and cell damage. High molecular group S (HMGB1) is
a major alarmin that binds to the receptor for advanced
glycation end-products (RAGE). Advanced glycation end-
products (AGEs) are also present in foods. We propose the
‘‘false alarm’’ hypothesis, in which AGEs that are present in
or formed from the food in our diet are predisposing to food
allergy. The Western diet is high in AGEs, which are derived
from cooked meat, oils, and cheese. AGEs are also formed in
the presence of a high concentration of sugars. We propose
that a diet high in AGEs and AGE-forming sugars results in
misinterpretation of a threat from dietary allergens,
promoting the development of food allergy. AGEs and other
alarmins inadvertently prime innate signaling through
multiple mechanisms, resulting in the development of allergic
phenotypes. Current hypotheses and models of food allergy
do not adequately explain the dramatic increase in food
allergy in Western countries. Dietary AGEs and AGE-
forming sugars might be the missing link, a hypothesis
supported by a number of convincing epidemiologic and
experimental observations, as discussed in this article. (J
Allergy Clin Immunol 2017;139:429-37.)

Food allergies have increased dramatically in the last 30 years,
particularly in westernized developed countries. More recently,
developing countries are observing a similar trend. Food allergy
and its common comorbidity eczema represent ‘‘gateway’’
diseases, seemingly opening the door for the chronic inhalant
diseases of allergic asthma, rhinitis, and conjunctivitis. Establish-
ing the important factors in the development of food allergy has
been a focus of research in many centers; however, there has not
been a conclusive answer to firmly clarify the mechanisms by
which food allergy occurs. The major explanations behind the
increase in food allergy currently include a combination of the
following:
1. Hygiene/microbiota type and microbial diversity. This the-
ory developed from animal studies in which rearing in ster-
ile environments resulted in allergic features including
dermatitis, TH2 responses, and anaphylaxis.1,2 In 1989,
Strachan3 proposed the hygiene hypothesis, and studies
demonstrating the influence of microbiota type, timing, di-
versity, farm exposure, and intervention studies with probi-
otics and prebiotics add credence to this line of thought.4-6
Bach7 convincingly correlated an increase in both allergic
and autoimmune disease with a reduction in severe
infections
2. The timing of complementary food introduction appears to
be important in the development of tolerance. Recently, the
concept of giving peanut in the first year of life has been
shown to reduce peanut allergy in a high-risk cohort in
the United Kingdom.8,9
3. Low vitamin D levels in infancy appear to be a risk factor
for the development of peanut and egg allergy, and the
distance one lives from the equator in the United States
and Australia has been correlated with epinephrine auto-
injector prescriptions used as a surrogate for food
allergy.10-12
4. Other cofactors include antibiotics, diversity of feeding,
use of antacids, and types of fatty acids (lower levels of
omega 3 and linoleic acid) in the diet, and phylates in plas-
tics appear to promote allergic responses.13,14
Food allergy involving IgE is a maladaptive and learned
immunologic threat response to an innocent allergen (usually
common foods) that should normally provide nutrition and health
benefits. Something is likely to have changed dramatically in the
Western lifestyle in the last half-century that is promoting this

immunologic misdirection. IgE-mediated milk allergy is reported
to currently affect between 2% and 7.5% of children15; however,
the first case of allergy to milk (fatal anaphylaxis) was reported in
the German literature in 1905.16
Only recently, it has become apparent that allergic reactions are
not solely based on IgE antibodies and TH2 cells. Many other cell
types, including innate lymphoid cells and epithelial barrier func-
tions, for example, play a crucial role in the allergic response.17-22
However, much of the research focus has attempted to link adap-
tive immune responses, such as IgE levels and cytokine patterns,
to allergic phenotypes. Similarly, there have been risk associa-
tions made with a variety of genes involving barriers, IgE, cyto-
kines,
antiproteases,
pattern
recognition
and
response
molecules, and food allergy. Human genetics could not have
changed dramatically in the last 20 to 30 years in westernized
countries; however, the way the genes function can be altered
by environmental factors (eg, methylation, ubiquitination, and
histone acetylation), and this is another direction of research. It
appears that the extent and pattern of gene methylation can pre-
dict the likelihood of food allergy.23 The parameters for the ma-
jority of epigenetic research remain focused at the level of
allergic phenotypes and adaptive immune responses. Adaptive
immune responses are largely guided by messages and signaling
from the innate immune system; however, there has been minimal
focus on innate immunity in terms of the mechanism of food
allergy.
ALARMINS, ADVANCED GLYCATED END-
PRODUCTS, AND RECEPTOR FOR ADVANCED
GLYCATED END-PRODUCTS
High mobility group box 1 is a major alarmin that
promotes TH2 responses
Alarmins are normally released from all cells that undergo
nonprogrammed cell death.24 This is an innate mechanism by
which dying cells signal danger and recruit elements of the adap-
tive immune response. The high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)
is a key alarmin released with tissue damage. Activated dendritic
cells (DCs) secrete HMBG1, and this appears to be critical in the
activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes.25 HMGB1 can be
released from cells during inflammation or through stimulation
from pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as Toll-like
receptors (TLRs).24
HMGB1 binds to receptor for advanced glycated
end-products
HMBG1 binds to its receptor, receptor for advanced glycation
end-products (RAGE; an immunoglobulin family member only
present in mammals), to induce maturation of DCs, neurite
growth, and activation and migration of monocytes, macro-
phages, neutrophils, and DCs and to induce inflammation and
oxidative pathways.24,26-28 HMGB1 can signal through both
RAGE and TLRs, such as TLR2 and TLR4.29,30 Although
TLR2/4 stimulation has been reported to be protective against
food allergy,31 an airway model of allergy has shown that TLR4
agonism in conjunction with HMBG1 amplifies the allergic
response32 and blocks the TLR4-attenuated allergic response to
fungal proteinase.33 RAGE also binds to and is activated by other
alarmins, such as S100 proteins and amyloid b-peptide.34
HMGB1/RAGE alarmin signaling is critical for
allergic responses
Activation of RAGE receptors is proinflammatory and promotes
adaptive (and maladaptive in the cases of diabetes, atherosclerosis,
and Alzheimer disease) immune responses.35,36 RAGE knockout
mice have attenuated responses to inhalant allergens.37 Ullah
et al32 have recently demonstrated a role for the HMGB1-RAGE
axis in airway sensitization and airway inflammation. The
attenuated response to inhalant allergens in Rage2/2 mice37 might
be due to significantly reduced numbers of DCs in the lung and
draining lymph nodes. Recently, Oczypok et al38 have shown that
RAGE drives allergic airway inflammation by promoting IL-33
expression and accumulation of type 2 innate lymphoid cells in
the airways. Thus far, there is no direct evidence suggesting
advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) trigger food allergy
through interaction with RAGE.
Western diet high in AGEs can induce alarmin
signaling
The RAGE receptor also binds to and is activated by glycated
proteins. High blood sugar levels (eg, in patients with diabetes)
are associated with increased glycation of endogenous proteins
and a proinflammatory state.39 The Western diet can contribute
significantly to the AGE pool, with up to 10% of dietary
consumed AGEs being absorbed systemically and only an esti-
mated one third being excreted.35,40 Dietary AGEs are produced
in high amounts, particularly with animal proteins and fats that
are cooked at high temperatures (eg, fast foods and cooked meats
are particularly high in AGEs), to expose amino acid chains to
which sugars bind. There are several intermediate products in
the formation of AGEs, such as Amadori, and Schiff base during
the Maillard reaction. The Maillard reaction (also referred to as
‘‘glycation’’) describes a complex series of chemical reactions be-
tween carbonyl compounds, such as reducing sugar, and amino
compounds, such as amino acids and protein. AGEs are a hetero-
geneous group of compounds that are produced at the late phase
of the Maillard reaction.41 We see glycation in many foods as the
crispiness and browning of foods with cooking; however, AGEs
are also readily formed with super-high heating, such as micro-
wave cooking and frying.40 Sugar moieties are bound to proteins
or lipids, leading to formation of AGEs (also called glycotoxins).
The most well-characterized glycotoxins are methylglyoxal42 and
N(ε)-carboxymethyllysine (CML).43 Methylglyoxal is a carcin-
ogen capable of cleaving DNA and inducing damage to nucleic
acids.42,44,45 Fructose is a key substrate in the formation of
methylglyoxal.
As highlighted previously, RAGE activation by alarmins
induces immunologic activation and multiple inflammatory

 responses. RAGE is highly expressed on DCs, macrophages, T
lymphocytes, and B cells, as well as mast cells and baso-
phils.32,46-49 AGEs binding to the RAGE receptor activate mast
cells and induce exocytosis of histamine and generation of oxida-
tive stress products in a dose-dependent mechanism (within
20 seconds).49 T-cell activation and proliferation is dependent
on RAGE activation,25 and DCs require RAGE signaling for
migration to lymph nodes in response to an antigen.50 A RAGE
knockout mouse model blocked immunologic responses to anti-
gen, abrogating IL-5, IL-13, and exotoxin production, whereas
an inhibitor of RAGE blocked responses to house dust mite.37
Because DCs are at the forefront of immune responses, inadver-
tent sensitization to allergens by RAGE-activated DCs is likely
important and a potential target for interventions. HMGB1 is
recognized as an innate signal, along with S100, and both are
released in conjunction with cell injury. HMGB1 expression is
likely to recruit engagement of adaptive response elements,
such as IL-33, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, and IL-25. More-
over, because of the antigen specificity of B and T cells, RAGE
ligation in these cells is more likely to cause generalized immune
activation during an AGE-induced (both dietary and endogenous)
inflammatory reaction rather than a specific response to an
allergen.
There is an indirect link between Western diet, AGEs, and
allergic responses through production of another alarmin, uric
acid. Fructose is metabolized by the liver, resulting in, among
other waste products, large amounts of uric acid. Serum uric acid
levels are a predictor of fructose toxicity. Uric acid has been
shown to act as a sensor of inhaled allergens and a potent adjuvant
to induce TH2 responses during allergic inflammation.51,52 Over-
production of uric acid has been shown to play a critical role in the
induction of peanut-induced allergic sensitization through its ac-
tion on DCs.53
HAS THE WESTERN DIET/LIFESTYLE CHANGED TO
MIMIC TISSUE DAMAGE THROUGH AGE?
Dietary AGEs that glycate endogenous proteins can contribute
to AGEs that are readily measured in serum.39,40 Tobacco smoke
generates measurable increases in AGE levels in serum and the
skin.54 The Western diet is high in AGEs, which are largely
derived from cooked meat, oils, and cheese.40,55 Recently, an
environmental and ecologic analysis of national diets has linked
Alzheimer disease to higher levels of dietary AGEs, and this cor-
relates with findings of more rapid neurological decrease in pa-

Glycation of allergens
It is worthwhile pointing out that roasting of peanuts increases
glycation and allergenicity,57-60 whereas boiling reduces allerge-
nicity.58,61 In fact, prolonged heating might degrade Ara h 1, 2,
and 6 antigens.61,62 AGE-stimulated DCs have been shown to
induce a stronger TH2 and a weaker TH1 cytokine response to
ovalbumin (OVA).63 Microwaving whole milk increases AGE
production by 5-fold at 1 minute and 86-fold at 3 minutes.40
Not all food glycation increases allergy. A high degree of glyca-
tion of b-lactoglobulin has a masking effect on the recognition of
epitopes by IgE.64 The Maillard reaction has been reported to
reduce allergenicity of squid, scallop, cherries, apple, and
buckwheat. This could be due to reduced heat stability of aller-
genic proteins in these foods unrelated to AGE formation or gly-
cation masking allergenic epitopes.65-68
Fast food consumption and chronic lifestyle
diseases
Bach7 elegantly demonstrated an epidemiologic association
with reducing severe infections in the Western world and an in-
crease in autoimmune disease between 1950 and 2000. If these
data are compared over time with increases in eczema, food al-
lergy, and anaphylaxis discharge data,69-71 a similar pattern of in-
crease is apparent (Fig 1).7 Using data from the US Department of
Agriculture, the consumption of sugar, particularly fructose, has
increased dramatically between 1950 and 2000.72 Potato con-
sumption has increased, and these are being consumed more in
the form of French fries and crisps. French fries are the most
consumed vegetable in American 2- to 4-year-olds, and almost
90% of 3- to 4-year-olds are consuming a fructose-sweetened
drink, dessert, or candy every day.73 Fig 1 also plots McDonald’s
outlets in the United States and common fast food outlets in
Australia (data from company Web sites), and the period of
actively promoting upsizing occurred from the 1980s to 2002.
Fast food outlets have been presented in the article not to
attribute blame but to reflect the types of foods that are being more
frequently consumed in these countries over time. In the 1950s,
consumption of soda generally involved an infrequent social
outing, whereas currently, the common and recurring consump-
tion in Western countries is with large-volume multipacks.
Along with fast foods, the consumption of peanuts (and peanut
products) has also increased in the westernized world, including
the US, according to the American Peanut Shellers Association.
This is in part due to US governmental subsidies and aggressive
promotion and marketing. The majority of peanuts are consumed
as peanut butter in the United States and other peanut products
that are dry roasted because these are the most preferred snacks
among all others types, resulting in enhanced exposure of the
population to the more allergenic glycosylated peanut.74-76
Foods considered unhealthy by current standards are associated
with lower socioeconomic levels and poverty.77 The risk of food
allergy in families of higher socioeconomic status has multiple
contributing factors. Some recognized associations include
increased hygiene, less microbial diversity, pollution, activities
that result in lower vitamin D levels (indoor play, sunscreen,
and urban environment), increased medical attention for illness,
and prescription of antibiotics. Dietary factors (ie, high AGE
load) such as consumption of sugars (sweets and beverages),
autoclaved/processed foods, microwaved foods, more roasted/
barbecued meat, and dessert after every meal might be more
prevalent in families of higher socioeconomic status. Affluence
is associated with increased protein consumption in the form of
red meat; this does tail off with higher marked affluence. This re-
quires further study in itself, but awareness of dietary AGEs and
the possible metabolic consequences of glycation allow consider-
ation of these when taking a dietary history.
Gestational diabetes mellitus is associated with increased fetal
exposure to glycation products created from greater glycation of
endogenous proteins through a nonenzymatic mechanism caused
by higher levels of blood glucose. Gestational diabetes mellitus
has been associated with an increased risk of atopic dermatitis and
IgE sensitization (mainly from food) by 1.7- and 1.6-fold,

 respectively, but only in those born after 37 weeks.78 If endoge-
nous or dietary AGEs are related to allergic risk, it would appear
that the immunologic response is more vulnerable or capable of
eliciting a response in later pregnancy. Children have the lowest
levels of RAGE when measured.79 Yet food allergy predomi-
nantly affects children. Poor eating habits start with the parents
and are likely to commence in infancy/toddlerhood. Younger chil-
dren have greater gastrointestinal/epithelial permeability and this
has been suggested to contribute to the risk of atopic disease.80 It
is likely that dietary AGEs from the gastrointestinal tract would
be absorbed more during the time of heightened permeability of
the intestine. The immaturity of the immune system might also
make infants more susceptible to environmental/epigenetic influ-
ences.81 In addition, AGEs are also known to be passed through
breast milk, contributing to the infant’s AGE load.82 Levels of
CML, a potent AGE, were found to be 35- to 70-fold higher in in-
fant formulas compared with breast milk.83,84 However, to our
knowledge, there are no studies that tested the direct effects of
AGEs on the induction of food allergy in children.
Ways to mitigate deleterious effects of AGE/RAGE-
induced inflammation
Living in a rural environment has been associated with a lower
risk of food allergy, and this has helped to reinforce the hygiene
hypothesis.45 Microbial colonies appear to be influenced by
diet.85 Geographic remoteness has been attributed to a low
incidence of childhood
food allergy and anaphylaxis in
Australia.86 Children in rural areas consume less sugar (2 times
less) in foods and fast food than urban children.87-89 Within urban
populations, food deserts (lack of access to supermarkets and
increased consumption of fast foods) have been associated with
an increased incidence of food allergy (odds ratio, 1.56).90
Bacteria signal HMGB1 through TLRs.91 Probiotic bacteria,
such as lactobacilli, produce the enzyme glyoxalase,92 which is
capable of degrading AGEs, and both prebiotics and probiotics
have been demonstrated to reduce AGE levels in milk.93 Milk nor-
mally has very low amounts of AGEs, but when heated to dry and
create a milk powder, levels increase up to 670-fold.83,94-96 Es-
cherichia coli produces endogenous AGEs, and these have been
shown to contribute to the inflammatory response.97 Higher con-
sumption of glycated dietary proteins has been shown to increase
the amount of putatively harmful bacteria and reduce the propor-
tion of putatively beneficial bacteria.98 It is plausible that the ‘‘hy-
giene’’ effect is in part due to the AGE-RAGE axis influence on
microbiota.
Dietary flavonoids, such as (-)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate (from
green tea), phloridzin and phloretin (from apples), and quercetin
and genistein (soy isoflavone), have been shown to trap methyl-
glyoxal, a well-known precursor of AGEs.99-102 Mouse models
using antiglycation compounds, such as resveratrol and the soy
isoflavones daidzein and genistein,103,104 have been demonstrated
to abrogate OVA and peanut allergy. The preventative effects of
these compounds appear to reduce DC activation by means of
FIG 2. Total immunologic influence of AGEs should be considered as a sum of dietary AGEs that are
absorbed. Dietary AGEs influence the pattern of microbiota, their production of AGEs, or glyoxalase enzyme
activity. Low vitamin D levels are associated with epithelial injury and risk of infection and expression of
RAGE. Dietary sugars bind to endogenous proteins and bacterial proteins to further add to the AGE pool.
Soluble RAGE and the amount of endogenous glyoxalase enzymes will reduce the effect of the total AGE
pool. RAGE activation influences multiple immune cells and multiple proallergic mediators. ILC2, Type 2

 glycation; however, reduction of oxidative pathways is also likely
to be a factor.57,105 It is likely that the anti-AGE activity of these
compounds could play a role in reducing food-induced allergic
responses. When considering the glycation pool, consumed
AGEs, sugars (particularly fructose), microbiota, and glycation-
limiting and antioxidant foods should be considered, in addition
to alarmin signaling (Fig 2).
Urribarri et al106 have shown that culinary techniques practiced
in Mediterranean and Asian cuisines limit dietary AGE generation
compared with Western cooking practices (eg, frying and
broiling). The association between the consumption of traditional
soy food (particularly fermented soy food rich in isoflavones) in
Asian countries and the low incidence of chronic health disorders
are well known.107,108 It is interesting to note that fermentation
byproducts inhibit formation of CML, a major AGE.109 The
potential inverse correlation between the incidence of food
allergy and exposure to sunlight and vitamin D levels might be
explained by the in vitro observation that RAGE expression was
downregulated by stimulation with calcitriol in human umbilical
vein endothelial cells.110 These findings, when considered

 together, provide a compelling association between the incidence
of allergic diseases, especially food allergy, and consumption of
AGEs.
FOOD ALLERGY AND BEYOND
Food allergy is likely to be the first manifestation of excessive
RAGE activation. If AGEs do influence the development of
allergy, the greatest exposure to dietary AGEs and AGE-forming
sugars will be in the gastrointestinal tract. The allergic march and
development of rhinitis and asthma could also relate to ongoing
unhealthy eating by current standards and reactivity of the
immune system with inhaled allergens. The 3 published Interna-
tional Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood studies have
repeatedly observed an association between fast food consump-
tion being a risk factor and fresh foods and vegetables having
protective
effects
for
eczema,
rhinoconjunctivitis,
and
asthma.69,111-113 A low-AGE diet (reported as an antioxidant
diet) has been reported to improve lung function and systemic in-
flammatory indices in adults with asthma.114 Sugar consumption
in early life is associated with severe asthma,115 and specifically,
excess free fructose consumption from fruit juices and soft drinks
(popular soft drinks can contain 65% fructose/35% glucose) has
been associated with increased risk of asthma.116 It has been hy-
pothesized that excess dietary fructose provides a substrate for the
formation of AGEs with bacterial protein products, which then
mimic alarmin signaling.116 We hypothesize that food allergy is
an early manifestation of a misdirected immune response to an
innate signal. If a diet is high in AGEs and AGE-forming sugars,
the child will be more likely to have allergic responses to inhalant
allergens, manifesting as rhinitis and asthma.
There are implications in health policies and practices for
westernized and developing countries for what we eat and how it
is prepared, and already there are volumes of evidence regarding
health benefits from a low-AGE diet. Emerging evidence suggests
that a potential role of AGE modification of proteins is predis-
posing to food allergy.63,117 AGE modifications have been found
on a model food allergen, OVA, with concomitant binding of AGE
OVA to RAGE, inducing a stronger allergic response than nongly-
cated OVA.63 Similar glycation changes have been demonstrated
on Ara h 1 and Ara h 3 (but not Ara h 2), with concomitant binding
to RAGE. However, this modification did not seem to influence
IgE binding.118 It is interesting to note that more than 90% of pa-
tients with peanut allergy show IgE binding to Ara h 2,119 despite
the lack of AGE modifications in Ara h 2. This observation sug-
gests that AGE adduct formation might not directly contribute
to allergenicity of the proteins but might facilitate TH2 skewing
through other means (eg, DC activation63).
SUMMARY
Current hypotheses and models of food allergy do not
adequately explain the dramatic increase in food allergy in
westernized countries in the last 30 years. Dietary AGEs and
AGE-forming sugars might be the missing link, and this hypoth-
esis is supported by geographic and regional consumption and
patterns of allergy appearing to match AGE consumption, fetal
exposure to higher AGE levels in late pregnancy being associated
with an increased incidence of atopic dermatitis and food
sensitization, and allergy-protective microbiota interventional
animal models and in vitro data on the effect of AGEs and
activation of the RAGE receptor. The supporting materials dis-
cussed in this article are presented in Table I,* and key points
are provided in Table II, which provides credence to but does
not prove a false alarmin hypothesis caused by dietary changes
in the Western world. This theory integrates knowledge of the ef-
fects of the hygiene hypothesis and nutritional aspects. Proof
needs to be established of the biological relevance of dietary
AGEs on immune responses with prospective epidemiologic
and observational studies and specific laboratory research both
in vivo and in vitro.
