ABSTRACT
More than 1 million heart failure hospitalizations occur annually, and congestion is the predominant cause.
Rehospitalizations for recurrent congestion portend poor outcomes independently of age and renal function.
Persistent congestion trumps serum creatinine increases in predicting adverse heart failure outcomes. No
decongestive pharmacological therapy has reduced these harmful consequences. Simplified ultrafiltration devices
permit fluid removal in lower-acuity hospital settings, but with conflicting results regarding safety and efficacy.
Ultrafiltration performed at fixed rates after onset of therapy-induced increased serum creatinine was not superior
to standard care and resulted in more complications. In contrast, compared with diuretic agents, some data suggest
that adjustment of ultrafiltration rates to patients’ vital signs and renal function may be associated with more
effective decongestion and fewer heart failure events. Essential aspects of ultrafiltration remain poorly defined.
Further research is urgently needed, given the burden of congestion and data suggesting sustained benefits of early
and adjustable ultrafiltration. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2017;69:2428–45) © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier on

 A
nnual
hospitalizations
for
heart
failure
exceed 1 million in both the United States
and Europe, and more than 90% are due to
symptoms and signs of fluid overload. In addition,
up to 1 in 4 patients (24%) are readmitted within 30
days, and 1 in 2 patients (50%) are readmitted within
6 months (1,2). Recurrent fluid overload in heart fail-
ure has uniformly been associated with worse out-
comes independently of age and renal function (3).
PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF
FLUID OVERLOAD
Compared
with
normal
subjects,
asymptomatic
patients with heart failure have decreased sodium
excretion
in
response
to
volume
expansion
(4).
Abnormal
fluid
handling
leads
to
physiological
abnormalities in multiple organ systems. Increased
myocardial water can lead to ischemia and decreased
contractility in animals and humans (5–8). Deranged
hemodynamics, neurohormonal activation, excessive
tubular sodium reabsorption, inflammation, oxida-
tive stress, and nephrotoxic medications are impor-
tant drivers of harmful cardiorenal interactions in
patients with heart failure (8–10).
Elevation of central venous pressure is rapidly
transmitted to the renal veins, causing increased
interstitial and tubular hydrostatic pressure, which
decreases
net
glomerular
filtration
(9,11,12).
An
increased central venous pressure is independently
associated with renal dysfunction and unfavorable
outcomes in both acute and chronic heart failure
(13,14). Venous congestion itself can produce endo-
thelial
activation,
up-regulation
of
inflammatory
cytokines, hepatic dysfunction, and intestinal villi
ischemia (15). Bacterial endotoxins can then enter the
circulation,
magnifying
the
inflammatory
milieu
created by venous congestion and neurohormonal
activity (8).
Three
recent
studies
suggest
that
failure
to
adequately
reduce
fluid
excess
in
patients
with
acutely
decompensated
heart
failure
trumps
increases in serum creatinine in predicting poor
outcomes (16). Thus, the foremost goal in managing
acutely decompensated heart failure is to effectively
resolve fluid overload (16). Therefore, if a decrease in
intravascular volume by fluid removal causes small
transient increases in serum creatinine, effective
decongestion may still be essential to protect
the kidney in the long term (16,17). With-
drawal of diuretic agents in 30 euvolemic
patients with heart failure resulted in in-
creases in urinary levels of kidney injury
molecule-1, which returned to baseline with
resumption of diuretic agents. Thus, in heart failure,
even subclinical fluid overload can be associated with
biological evidence of tubular dysfunction (18). An
unresolved challenge is the ability to discern whether
increase in serum creatinine during fluid removal is
driven
primarily
by
hemodynamic
decreases
in
glomerular filtration rate or by development of acute
tubular damage, which can progress to chronic kidney
disease (19).
UNRESPONSIVENESS TO DIURETIC AGENTS
IN HEART FAILURE
Diuretic agents remain the cornerstone of therapy for
fluid overload. Although effective early in heart
failure, diuretic agents become increasingly ineffec-
tive with disease progression due to the development
of unresponsiveness in a significant subset of patients
(20). Excellent
reviews
describe
the
mechanisms
leading to decreased diuretic agent responsiveness
(21). In patients with heart failure, impaired absorp-
tion, decreased renal blood flow, azotemia, and pro-
teinuria all result in reduced levels of active diuretic
agents in the tubular lumen (21). Recently proposed
definitions of diuretic resistance include persistent
congestion, despite adequate and escalating doses of
diuretic agents equivalent to $80 mg/day furose-
mide; the amount of sodium excretion as a percent-
age of filtered load below 0.2%; and failure to excrete
at least 90 mmol of sodium within 72 h of a 160-mg
twice-daily dose of furosemide. Metrics for diuretic
agent response have also been proposed, including
weight loss per 40 mg of furosemide or equivalent;
net fluid loss per milligram of loop diuretic agent; and
natriuretic response to furosemide as urinary sodium-
to-urinary furosemide ratio (21).
The clinical hallmarks of diuretic agent resistance
are
insufficient
symptom
relief,
higher
risk
of
in-hospital
worsening
of
heart
failure,
increased
mortality after discharge, and a 3-fold increase in
rehospitalization
rates (21,22). Among more

study, only 33% lost $2.27 kg (5 lbs), and 16% gained
weight during hospitalization. Nearly one-half of
hospitalized
patients
with
heart
failure
are
dis-
charged with residual fluid excess after receiving
conventional diuretic therapies (23). Regardless of
diuretic strategy, 42% of acutely decompensated
heart failure subjects in the DOSE (Diuretic Optimi-
zation Strategies Evaluation) trial reached the com-
posite
endpoint
of
death,
rehospitalization,
or
emergency department visit at 60 days (24). Vaso-
pressin
and
adenosine-A1
receptor
antagonists,
exogenous natriuretic peptides, and low-dose dopa-
mine, studied as either a complement or a replace-
ment
for
conventional
diuretic
therapies,
can
decrease fluid overload in the short term but have
failed to improve long-term outcomes (25–27).
Therefore, there is a clear, unmet clinical need for
alternative methods of fluid removal with superior
efficacy in patients with heart failure. One therapy
that might prove successful is extracorporeal ultra-
filtration (UF) (28,29). Greater access to UF has been
facilitated by the development of simplified devices
that do not require specialized technicians or acute
care settings (Online Table 1) (30).
Over the past 20 years, several small studies have
attempted to define the physiological rationale for
the clinical benefits of mechanical fluid removal by
UF in heart failure (31–35). However, concerns arose
from reports of treatment-related adverse events (32).
Thus, the principal aims of this paper were to review
the available data for the use of UF in patients with
heart failure, describe the knowledge gaps in this
area, and outline potential future studies to answer
unresolved questions.
PROCESS OF FLUID REMOVAL BY UF,
HEMOFILTERS, PUMPS, AND
VASCULAR ACCESS
Ultrafiltration consists of the production of plasma
water from whole blood across a semipermeable
membrane
(hemofilter)
in
response
to
a
trans-
membrane
pressure
gradient
(29).
The
newer,
simplified UF devices afford the advantages of small
size,
portability,
low
blood
flow
rates,
and
an
extracorporeal blood volume below 50 ml. These
devices provide a wide range of UF rates (0 to 500
ml/h) and do not mandate admission to intensive
care units or cannulation of a central vein. The
characteristics of 2 of these devices are shown in
Figure 1. Additional details for hemofilters, pumps,
and vascular access for UF can be found in Online
Appendix in Section 1.0.
DIFFERENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF
DIURETIC AGENT AND UF-BASED
FLUID REMOVAL
Loop diuretic agents selectively block the Naþ/Kþ/
2Cl� cotransporter in the luminal membrane of the
medullary thick ascending loop of Henle. Edema in
patients with heart failure is isotonic, and therefore
normonatremic
edematous
patients
have
signifi-
cantly increased total body sodium. Because loop
diuretic agents inhibit sodium reabsorption at a site
in the kidney also critical for water reabsorption, they
generally result in greater loss of water than sodium
and therefore generate hypotonic urine (29).
In contrast, because the ultrafiltrate is almost
iso-osmotic and isonatremic compared to plasma,
approximately
134
to
138
mmol
of
sodium
are
removed with each liter of ultrafiltrate (29). Thus, for
any amount of fluid withdrawn, more sodium is likely
to be removed with UF than with diuretic agents (29).
Conversely, with these drugs, changes in intravas-
cular volume are unpredictable. Furthermore, loop
diuretic agents inhibit sodium chloride uptake in the
macula
densa,
an
event
that,
coupled
with
augmented release of prostacyclin, enhances renal
secretion of renin (9,29). These effects augment
neurohormonal activation, which ultimately reduces
diuretic agents’ effectiveness (9). As opposed to the
direct effect of loop diuretic agents on the macula
densa, with UF, neurohormonal activation should
occur only if the fluid removal rate causes intravas-
cular volume depletion by exceeding the plasma
refilling rate (Table 1) (35). This measure of plasma
water
transport
from
the
interstitium
into
the
vasculature
during
fluid
removal
varies
between
patients depending upon serum albumin concentra-
tion
(i.e.,
serum
oncotic
pressure)
and
capillary
permeability.
CLINICAL RESEARCH PRECEDING
CONTROLLED TRIALS OF UF IN
HEART FAILURE
Studies of extracorporeal fluid removal conducted
before the introduction of contemporary UF devices
are summarized in Online Table 2. The key lessons
from these early investigations are that UF can
restore diuretic agent responsiveness, but overly
aggressive fluid removal can convert nonoliguric
renal dysfunction into oliguric failure and dialysis
dependence (34,35). A more detailed description of
the
early
studies
that
specifically
evaluated
the
mechanisms of action of extracorporeal fluid removal
can be found in Online Appendix in Section 2.0.

UF Circuit
(A) The console controls blood removal rates and extracts ultrafiltrate at a maximum rate set by the clinician. Blood is withdrawn from a vein through the
withdrawal catheter (red) connected by tubing to the blood pump. Blood passes through the withdrawal pressure sensor before entering the blood pump
tubing loop. After exiting the blood pump, blood passes through the air detector and enters the hemofilter (made of a bundle of hollow fibers) through a
port on the bottom, exits through the port at the top of the filter, and passes through the infusion pressure sensor before returning to the patient (blue).
The ultrafiltrate passes sequentially through the ultrafiltrate’s pressure sensor, the pump, and the collecting bag suspended from the weight scale. A
hematocrit sensor is located on the withdrawal line. (B) This UF system requires only a single-lumen, multihole, small (18-gauge) cannula inserted in a
peripheral vein of the arm. A syringe pump drives the blood inside the extracorporeal circuit, which includes 2 check valves that allow the blood to move
from the vein to the filter, and then returns it to the same vein through alternate flows that can be independent. The priming volume of 50 ml and the
reduced contact surface between blood and tubing set ensure minimal blood loss if circuit clots and for reduced heparin requirements. BD ¼ blood

 PILOT STUDIES WITH
CONTEMPORARY UF SYSTEMS
The
SAFE
(Simple
Access
Fluid
Extraction)
trial
showed that, in 21 congested patients with heart
failure, removal of an average of 2,600 ml of ultra-
filtrate during one 8-h treatment session reduced
weight by an average of 3 kg without changes in heart
rate, blood pressure, serum creatinine concentration,
and electrolytes or the occurrence of major adverse
events (30). Results of 2 additional pilot studies with
this system are summarized in Online Table 3.
The findings of both studies provided valuable in-
formation. First, the clinical benefits of UF can persist
beyond the index heart failure hospitalization up to
90 days. Second, UF is unlikely to improve outcomes
of patients with end-stage heart failure and should be
used very cautiously in this setting. Third, although
potentially
effective
in
reducing
central
venous
pressure,
aggressive
fluid
removal
in
preload-
dependent patients with heart failure, who have low
forward flow as the predominant mechanism for a
reduction in glomerular filtration rate, can rapidly
decrease renal perfusion pressure and cause oliguric
failure, leading to dialysis dependence (36–38). High
pre-treatment intravenous loop diuretic agent doses
may increase the risk of tubular injury when addi-
tional fluid is removed by UF (39).
RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS
The randomized controlled trials of UF are summa-
rized in Table 2 and Online Table 4. The RAPID-CHF
(Relief of Acutely Fluid-Overloaded Patients with
Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure) trial was
the first randomized study of UF to use the Aquadex
System 100 device (Sunshine Heart, Minneapolis,
Minnesota) (40). Although this small study did not
evaluate
patients’
outcomes
beyond
48
h,
it
confirmed that effective fluid removal and clinical
improvement may occur with UF (41).
The physiological fact that refill of the intravas-
cular space from the edematous interstitium de-
creases as fluid is removed led to the hypothesis that
initiation of UF before the plasma refilling rate is
decreased by previous diuretic agent-based therapies
might produce greater benefit than intravenous loop
diuretic agents in unequivocally congested patients
with heart failure. Hence, in the UNLOAD (Ultrafil-
tration Versus Intravenous Diuretics Decompensated
Heart
Failure)
trial,
randomization
had
to
occur
within 24 h of hospitalization, and a maximum of 2
intravenous loop diuretic agent doses were permitted
before enrollment (33). Compared with standard care
results, the UF group had greater weight loss and
similar improvement in dyspnea score (the coprimary
endpoints) at 48 h. The percentage of patients with
increases in serum creatinine levels $0.3 mg/dl was
slightly but insignificantly higher in the UF group
than in the control group at 24 and 48 h (33). Among
UNLOAD patients from a single center, use of iotha-
lamate
and
para-aminohippurate
to
measure
glomerular
filtration
rate
and
renal
plasma
flow
showed that UF and furosemide produce similar
changes
in
these
variables
(41).
There
were
no
between-group differences in duration of the index
hospitalization, a variable that can be influenced by
adjustment
of
oral
heart
failure
therapy
before
discharge, performance of additional diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures, treatment of comorbidities,
issues of patients’ placement, and lack of defined
discharge criteria (33,42). In UNLOAD, the 90-day
heart failure events were a pre-specified secondary
endpoint, and the investigators determined whether
these were related to worsening heart failure or not. It
cannot be said with certainty whether the fewer heart
failure events in 90 days in the UF group compared
with the standard care group were due to differences
in fluid loss, the nature of the fluid removed, or other
factors (33). Because UNLOAD did not have an inde-
pendent clinical events committee (CEC) to adjudi-
cate whether an event was heart failure-related or
not, the possibility of patient or investigator bias
cannot be excluded. A post hoc analysis of UNLOAD
compared the 100 UF patients with 100 usual-care
patients
subdivided
according
to
intravenous
diuretic agent strategy (continuous [n ¼ 32] or bolus
[n ¼ 68] administration) (43). Despite removal of the
same amount of fluid by UF and diuretic agent infu-
sion, 90-day heart failure events were fewer in the UF
group (p ¼ 0.016) (43). The simultaneous reduction of

 total body sodium and excess fluid by UF may be
more effective than removal of hypotonic fluid by
diuretic agents or free water by arginine vasopressin
V2 receptor antagonists (25,43,44). It is also possible
that
pre-hospitalization
diuretic
agent
use
itself
impairs
the
natriuretic
response
to
subsequent
intravenous administration of these drugs (21). In
UNLOAD,
complications
related
to
UF
included
clotting of 5 filters, 1 catheter infection, and the
requirement for hemodialysis in 1 patient deemed
unresponsive to UF (Table 2) (33).
The UNLOAD trial lacked treatment targets, blood
volume assessments, cost analysis, and adjudication
of events by an independent CEC. Nevertheless,
compared with standard care, UF initiated before the
administration
of
high-dose
intravenous
diuretic
agents led to greater fluid loss at 48 h and reduced
90-day heart failure events. In the ULTRADISCO
(Effects of ULTRAfiltration vs. DIureticS on clinical,
biohumoral and hemodynamic variables in patients
with deCOmpensated heart failure) study, at 36 h,
compared with the diuretic agent group, the UF
patients had greater reduction in body weight, signs
and
symptoms
of
heart
failure,
aldosterone
and
N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels, and
systemic
vascular
resistance,
as
well
as
greater
improvements in objective measures of cardiac per-
formance (45). Albeit very small, this study suggests
that effective fluid removal may be associated with
improved cardiac function (35,45–47).
The CARRESS-HF (Cardiorenal Rescue Study in
Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) trial compared
the effects of UF delivered at a fixed rate of 200 ml/h
with
those
of
stepped
pharmacological
therapy
inclusive of adjustable doses of intravenous loop
diuretic agents, thiazide diuretic agents, vasodilators,
and inotropes in acutely decompensated patients
with
heart
failure
who
had
experienced
a
pre-
randomization
increase
in
serum
creatinine
(19,32,48). The primary endpoint of CARRESS-HF was
the bivariate change in serum creatinine and body
weight from baseline to 96 h after randomization (32).
According
to
the
CARRESS-HF
design
(48),
this
primary endpoint assumes that weight loss is a
measurement of effective fluid removal and that an
increase in serum creatinine represents acute tubular
injury. In CARRESS-HF, both groups lost an equiva-
lent amount of weight, but greater increases in serum
creatinine occurred with UF (32). In addition, a higher
percentage of patients in the UF group experienced
serious adverse events (Table 2) (32). However, the
fact that 37 patients (39%) in the UF group received
only diuretic agents or were given these drugs before
the assessment of the primary endpoint at 96 h
impairs adjudication of adverse events to one or the
other therapy.
Although
in
heart
failure
increases
in
serum
creatinine ($0.3 mg/dl) have been equated to actual
renal
tubular
damage,
which
portends
adverse
long-term prognosis, transient increases in serum
creatinine may simply reflect a hemodynamically
driven reduction in glomerular filtration rate akin to
that occurring with angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that
transient increases in serum creatinine may reflect
more complete decongestion and, instead, forecast
improved post-discharge outcomes (17). Crossover
rates in CARRESS-HF also impaired interpretation of
the findings of a recent substudy where plasma renin
activity and aldosterone levels were higher in the UF
group than in the stepped pharmacological therapy
group at 96 h. Because neurohormonal levels were
not measured beyond this time point, it remains un-
known
whether
the
observed
neurohormonal
changes were transient or sustained (49).
In CARRESS-HF, the rate of fluid removal was
mandated to be 200 ml/h in all UF patients, and
adjustments
were
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
investigators,
“to
address
technical
problems
or
clinical care requirements” (32). A UF rate of 200 ml/h
may be excessive for patients with a lower blood
pressure and greater dependence on preload for he-

stability
(50,51).
Clinical
experience
shows that, regardless of the method used, removal
of fluid must be tailored to individual patients’ blood
pressure, renal function, urine output, and body
mass. The stepped pharmacological therapy patients
could receive care tailored to their characteristics,
including use of vasoactive drugs, which occurred in
12% of patients in this arm before 96 h (32). Vasoac-
tive agents were prohibited in the UF group, except as
rescue therapy. Interpretation of the results of the
CARRESS-HF trial is also hampered by the fact that
overall
outcomes
were
poor,
regardless
of
fluid
removal
strategy:
only
10%
of
the
patients
had
adequate improvement of signs of fluid overload at
96 h, and more than 30% died or were readmitted for
decompensated heart failure within 60 days (32,52).
In
the
CUORE
(Continuous
Ultrafiltration
for
Congestive Heart Failure) trial, UF-treated patients
had a lower incidence of heart failure rehospitaliza-
tions through 1 year (53) than those undergoing
standard
care,
despite
similar
weight
loss
at
discharge. In CUORE, diuretic agent therapy was
continued during UF in the belief that this approach
might help restore diuretic agent responsiveness by
enhancing urinary sodium excretion (53). In previous
studies, diuretic agent therapy was stopped during

 extracorporeal fluid removal on the basis of the
hypothesis that UF may give patients a “diuretic
holiday,” during which loop diuretic agent-induced
neurohormonal activation does not occur (33,54,55).
The
AVOID-HF
(Aquapheresis
versus
Intravenous
Diuretics and Hospitalization for Heart Failure) trial
tested the hypothesis that patients hospitalized for
heart failure who were treated with adjustable UF
would have a longer time to first heart failure event
within
90
days
than
those
receiving
adjustable
intravenous loop diuretic agents (56). The AVOID-HF
trial, designed as a multicenter, 1:1 randomized study
of 810 hospitalized patients with heart failure, was
terminated
unilaterally
and
prematurely
by
the
sponsor (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois) after
enrollment of 224 patients (27.5%). Detailed guide-
lines were provided to the investigators as to how to
adjust both of the therapies in response to patients’
vital signs, renal function, and urine output (Figures 2
and 3) (57). Patients in the adjustable UF group had a
nonstatistically significant trend to longer time to
first heart failure event than patients in the adjust-
able diuretic agents group (62 vs. 34 days, respec-
tively; p ¼ 0.106). Although the primary outcome did

statistical
significance,
several
pre-
specified secondary endpoints did. In particular, pa-
tients in the adjustable UF group had significantly
fewer heart failure and cardiovascular events at 30
days (56). Importantly, these events were adjudicated
by an independent committee blinded to randomized
therapy (56). The finding of similar renal function
changes in the 2 groups is consistent with that of
UNLOAD (33,56). In AVOID-HF, the average UF rate of
138 ml/h was lower than the fixed 200-ml/h rate of the
CARRESS-HF trial, and therapy was delivered over a
longer period (70 vs. 41 h, respectively) (32,56).
Adjustments
of
UF
rates
to
individual
patients’
hemodynamics and renal function may explain the
lack
of
differences
in
serum
creatinine
between
groups,
despite
a
larger
net
fluid
loss
with
UF
(Figures 2 and 3) (56). Although they are detailed, the
therapy guidelines were adopted by the AVOID-HF
investigators, most of whom continued to use them
in their clinical practice. Individualization of fluid
removal rates may explain why the reduction in heart
failure events occurred earlier in AVOID-HF than in
UNLOAD
(33,56).
Removal
of
isotonic
fluid
and
avoidance of renin release by the macula densa may
contribute to the benefit of UF (32,54,55). Restoration
of
diuretic
agent
responsiveness
may
be
a
key
mechanism by which UF delays recurrence of heart
failure events (56).

 of special interest (infection requiring intravenous

tomatic hypotension requiring vasopressor agents
or rapid fluid replacement, a drop in hemoglobin
>3 g/dl, and acute coronary syndrome requiring
intervention [31% vs. 17%, respectively; p ¼ 0.018]).
Serious therapy-related adverse events occurred at
higher rates in the UF group than in the diuretic
agents group (14.6% vs. 5.4%, respectively; p ¼ 0.026)
(56).
Although
in
AVOID-HF,
UF-related
adverse
events were fewer than in CARRESS-HF, the excess of
therapy-related complications with UF is a serious
concern
(32,56).
More
study
of
the
specifics
of
providing UF are needed to identify strategies aimed
at minimizing access-related and other potentially
preventable complications (32,56). Taken together,
the facts outlined in the preceding text indicate that
the AVOID-HF trial was unable to demonstrate that
adjustable UF is superior to adjustable diuretic agent
therapy. The statistically significant secondary out-
comes of fewer 30-day heart failure and cardiovas-
cular events are hypothesis-generating and do not
diminish the critical need for adequately powered
randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of
UF versus diuretic agent-based strategies on both
heart failure morbidity and mortality.
KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN THE USE OF
EXTRACORPOREAL UF IN HEART FAILURE
SELECTION OF POTENTIAL CANDIDATES. The con-
flicting results from UF studies highlight the fact that
patient
selection
and
fluid
removal
targets
are
incompletely understood (32,56). Practice guidelines
suggest that an inadequate response to an initial
dose of an intravenous loop diuretic agent be treated
with an increased dose of the same drug (54,55). If
this intervention is ineffective, invasive hemody-
namic
assessment
is
recommended.
Evidence
of
persistent fluid excess can then be treated with the
addition
of
thiazide
diuretic
agents,
aldosterone
antagonists, or continuous intravenous infusion of a
loop diuretic agent. Only if all these measures fail
can UF be considered (58,59). A similar degree of
diuretic agent resistance characterized eligibility for
enrollment
in
CARRESS-HF
(32,33,53,56).
In
this
trial, the poor outcomes of UF in patients with
the acute cardiorenal syndrome may be partially
related to the lack of therapy adjustment according
to individual patients’ characteristics. In AVOID-HF,
fine-tuning of UF rates in response to vital signs,
renal function, or urine output resulted in greater
net fluid loss and was associated with fewer 30-day
heart failure events without a greater increase in
serum
creatinine
levels
than
in
the
adjustable
diuretic agent group (56). These observations un-
derscore the critical need for additional investigation
of UF as both first-line and rescue therapies, pro-
vided that UF rates are adjusted in each patient in
response to changes in vital signs and renal function
(32,56).
Due to the potential complications and cost of UF,
it should not be used indiscriminately in decom-
pensated heart failure. For example, in patients with
de novo heart failure or those not receiving daily
diuretic agents, fluid overload can be rapidly elimi-
nated with intravenous diuretic agents, which should
be used in such cases instead of UF. The unanswered
question is which patients who develop heart failure
decompensation despite daily oral diuretic agents
should be considered for UF instead of intravenous
diuretic agents? To date, all studies of UF in patients
with heart failure have relied solely on clinical signs
and symptoms of fluid excess, both as inclusion
criteria and fluid removal targets. This is problematic
due to the poor correlation between clinical assess-
ment and objective measures of increased filling
pressures
(60).
A
European
consensus statement
that graded congestion according to a combination
of clinical and laboratory parameters suggested that
a score of $12, together with urine output of <1,000
ml/24 h, should trigger the use of UF because these
values are indicative of diuretic agent resistance (61).
This recommendation has not been prospectively
validated and relies on the unproven assumption that
the magnitude of fluid excess influences diuretic
agent responsiveness.
Data from 15 patients with acutely decompensated
heart failure show that urinary sodium concentration
in response to intravenous loop diuretic agents is
highly variable and lower than that in the ultrafiltrate
(44).
The
difficulty
in
predicting
the
natriuretic
response of individual patients to a given dose of
intravenous diuretic agent is underscored by the
absence
of
a
correlation
between
baseline
renal
function and urinary
sodium
concentration
after
furosemide administration (44). The hypothesis that
UF may be especially effective in patients with
urinary sodium concentrations of <100 mEq after a
specified dose of intravenous diuretic agents should
be
tested
in
randomized
trials.
A
single
non-
randomized prospective cohort study showed similar
effects of UF in heart failure with reduced versus
preserved
left
ventricular
ejection
fraction
(62).
However, because the 2 types of heart failure possess
distinct pathophysiological and clinical characteris-
tics, response to UF should be assessed in controlled
trials.

 FLUID REMOVAL TARGETS AND MONITORING OF UF
THERAPY. One important general recommendation is
that, once an initial UF rate has been chosen, it should
be either maintained or reduced because capillary
refill from the interstitium decreases as fluid is
removed (34). Although the optimal rate and duration
of UF must be individualized, UF rates of >250 ml/h
are not typically recommended (56,57). Patients with
predominantly right-sided heart failure or patients
with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction are
exquisitely
susceptible
to
intravascular
volume
depletion and may only tolerate low UF rates (50 to
100
ml/h)
(63).
In
addition,
clinical
experience
teaches that extracorporeal fluid removal is better
tolerated when conducted with low UF rates over
prolonged periods of time (32).
A frequently used approach is to compare patients’
current weight with that preceding the signs and
symptoms of congestion and to use this “dry weight”
as the target for fluid removal. No consensus exists on
whether removal of only 60% to 80% of excess fluid by
UF and continuation of loop diuretic agents during
therapy results in less hemodynamic instability and
greater urinary sodium excretion (53). Considering the
harmful renal effects of an increased central venous
pressure (9,13–15,34,35,64), controlled clinical trials
should determine if fluid removal by UF should be
adjusted to achieve specific central venous pressure
targets. In lieu of invasive measurements, ultraso-
nography can help estimate central venous pressure
with the assessment of the respiratory excursions of
the diameter of the inferior vena cava (65). Although
ultrasonography is noninvasive and inexpensive, its
reliability depends strictly depends on the operator’s
skill and the patient’s respiratory effort (65).
Studies
of
implantable
hemodynamic
monitors
have consistently shown that baseline pulmonary
artery diastolic pressure predicts heart failure events.
Interventions aimed at reducing pulmonary artery
pressures to pre-specified target ranges have effec-
tively reduced heart failure events without significant
renal function changes (66,67). The CardioMEMS
sensor (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, Minnesota) permits
measurement
of
pulmonary
artery
pressures
as
frequently as clinically indicated. Therefore, it is
conceivable
that,
in
patients
in
whom
the
CardioMEMS device has been implanted, fluid can be
removed by UF until the target range of pulmonary
artery pressures that effectively reduced heart failure
events has been achieved (66,67).

Ultrafiltration for Fluid Overload in Heart Failure

 BLOOD VOLUME AND FLUID EXCESS ESTIMATION.
The hematocrit is the ratio of the volume occupied by
red blood cells to that of whole blood. Because red
blood cell mass does not change in the short term
unless bleeding occurs, fluctuations in hematocrit
reflect changes in intravascular volume (68).
Online hematocrit sensors permit continuous esti-
mation of blood volume changes during UF and can
be programmed to stop fluid removal if the hemato-
crit exceeds a threshold set by the clinician (e.g., 5%
to 7%) and resume therapy when the hematocrit
value falls below the pre-specified limit, indicating an
adequate refilling of the intravascular volume from
the interstitial space (Online Figure 1) (68).
However, because numerous factors (e.g., change
in
body
position)
can
alter
hematocrit
values,
physical,
laboratory,
and
hemodynamic
variables
should be concomitantly assessed to determine the
appropriate UF rates and the amount of fluid that
should
be
removed
(68).
Bioimpedance
vector
analysis relies on
the
principle
that whole-body
impedance to an alternating current reflects total
body water (r ¼ 0.996) (69). Measurements of bio-
impedance vector require 2 pairs of electrodes be
placed on the wrist and ankles and the application of
a 50-kHz alternating microcurrent (CardioEFG, EFG
Diagnostics, Belfast, Northern Ireland) (69). It is
therefore
attractive
to
envision
the
use
of
bio-
impedance vector analysis to determine baseline
fluid status and then use of serial measurements to
guide the amount and rate of fluid removal by UF or
diuretic agents. Accuracy of bioimpedance vector
analysis can be reduced by diaphoresis, hirsutism,
incorrect electrode placement, cutaneous alterations,
or
improper
electrical
grounding.
Bioimpedance
spectroscopy is also being investigated in patients
with heart failure (70). Unfortunately, no existing
bioimpedance-based method can differentiate intra-
vascular from interstitial extracellular fluid volume, a
distinction that is critical for safe and effective fluid
removal (69,70).
Intrathoracic fluid can also be measured non-
invasively with electromagnetic technology inserted
in a removable vest (Sensible Medical Innovations,
Netanya, Israel). This device, shown in preclinical and
pilot human studies to measure intrathoracic water as
accurately as computed tomography, is being tested
in
a
prospective,
randomized
clinical
trial
(NCT02448342) (71). The measurement of blood vol-
ume using iodine-131-labeled albumin is accurate, but
the 6 to 9 blood draws needed to create the dilution
curve make it impractical for the serial assessments
needed during fluid removal (72). The lack of optimal
methods for the estimation of blood volume and fluid
excess underscores the critical need for research in
this area.
BIOMARKERS. The use of natriuretic peptides to
assess volume status and guide decongestive thera-
pies cannot be recommended because fluid overload is
not the sole cause of increases in the levels of these
biomarkers (73). The removal of fluid to achieve
pre-specified natriuretic peptide levels is untested in
acute heart failure. Serum creatinine is the sole
biomarker used to guide fluid removal because of the
belief that its level reflects both renal filtration func-
tion and tubular status. However, serum creatinine
was established and validated as a measurement of
renal function only at the point of steady-state
(constant production from the metabolism of muscle
creatine phosphate and unchanging glomerular filtra-
tion and urinary flow to excrete creatinine at a con-
stant rate). Therefore, it is unfortunate that serum
creatinine is the only widely available measurement of
renal function in patients with acute illnesses, such as
acutely decompensated heart failure, where the rates
of creatinine production and excretion may be altered.
Gene expression analysis has shown differences in the
genes expressed in acute kidney injury due to different
processes, even if the magnitude of rise in creatinine is
the same. Conversely, serum creatinine concentration
can be normal with documented tubular injury due to
the delayed achievement of detectable changes of this
analyte
(74).
Generally,
hemodynamically
driven
increases in serum creatinine resolve with treatment
in 24 to 72 h, whereas the cellular derangements due to
acute tubular damage, or even necrosis, may last for
weeks (75). Therefore, the duration of the elevation in
serum creatinine has a greater predictive effect on
morbidity and mortality than the extent of this bio-
marker’s elevation (76,77). Indeed, the use of increases
in
serum
creatinine
as
an
endpoint
for
acutely
decompensated heart failure trials has been chal-
lenged.
Evaluation
of
the
relationship
between
changes in serum creatinine and 60-day outcomes in
DOSE subjects revealed that increases in serum creat-
inine
from
baseline
to
72
h
(DOSE’s
coprimary
endpoint) was associated with lower risk for the com-
posite outcome of death or heart failure events.
Conversely, there was a strong relationship between
improved renal function and unfavorable 60-day
outcomes (78). Thus, serum creatinine changes are
an unreliable surrogate endpoint in trials of fluid
removal therapies. After the discovery by Mishra et al.
(79)
of
neutrophil
gelatinase-associated
lipocalin
(NGAL), which is secreted in the urine and the plasma
by a damaged kidney, it was shown that the expres-
sion/secretion of urine NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-

2440
 associated lipocalin) occurred within 3 h of the event
(sepsis, nephrotoxins, obstruction, ischemia); and
that the amount of secreted protein (from 20 ng/ml to
5 mg/ml) was proportional to the severity and time of
resolution of the stimulus. A growing body of evidence
suggests NGAL is not expressed when serum creati-
nine increases due to volume stressors. A systematic
study of thousands of genes encoding for several bio-
markers including NGAL, kidney injury molecule-1,
tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, and clusterin,
found that these molecules were detectable after a
brief dose of ischemia, yet none of these genes were
expressed after near-fatal volume depletion, despite
the rise in serum creatinine in both models (80).
Although this method is not yet widely available, in the
setting of any method of fluid removal, the levels of
urine NGAL and other biomarkers of tubular injury
could potentially help distinguish a rise in serum
creatinine
due
to
a
hemodynamically
mediated
decrease in glomerular filtration rate or actual tubular
injury
(74).
Numerous
genes
are
differentially
expressed depending upon the presence and type of
acute kidney injury. The levels of NGAL rise faster than
those of other indicators of renal injury, making
this biomarker better suited to distinguish between
hemodynamically,
versus
tubular
injury-driven
increases in serum creatinine that may occur during
fluid removal therapies (74,80).
ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS. To date, there has
been no prospective evaluation of the cost effective-
ness of UF therapy. The only published retrospective
estimate of UF costs is presented in the Online
Appendix in Section 3.0. Therefore, it is imperative
that
future
prospective
controlled
trials
include
rigorous cost-benefit analyses.
PROPOSAL FOR FUTURE STUDIES. No studies per-
formed to date have conclusively demonstrated the
superiority of one fluid removal method over another.
It is vital to continue searching for the most effective
and safest method to treat congestion, which worsens
the outcomes of patients with heart failure and cau-
ses unacceptably high hospitalization rates world-
wide. Concerning UF, priority should be given to
mechanistic studies including evaluation of diuretic
agent responsiveness at baseline during and after
fluid removal by using the measurements described
in this review (21). Hemodynamic measurements that
reflect fluid status (e.g., central venous pressure and
pulmonary artery diastolic pressure) should also be
performed at baseline and throughout therapy. Spe-
cific hemodynamic targets indicative of optimal fluid
status should be established in individual patients,
similar to the strategies used to guide medication
adjustment in studies of pulmonary artery pressure
sensors (63). Different UF rates should be tested in
terms of their ability to reach these hemodynamic
targets without causing renal tubular damage, as
detectable by increase in urine levels of biomarkers,
such as NGAL (70,73,76). This will require simulta-
neous measurement of the selected hemodynamic
values and biomarker levels capable of differentiating
rises
in
serum
creatinine
due
to
decreases
in
glomerular filtration rate produced by intravascular
fluid removal from those reflective of renal injury.
Serial measurements of urine and ultrafiltrate sodium
content (rather than randomly performed single-spot
measurements) may also help to better characterize
and compare the amount and pattern of sodium
extraction
during
UF
therapy
and
conventional
diuretic
agent-based
regimens.
This
noninvasive,
inexpensive, and readily available test can easily be
incorporated into future investigations. The results of
mechanistic studies are essential to determine how
fluid removal rates and amounts should be adjusted
in
individual
subjects
of
future
controlled
trials
(“precision” fluid removal).
Equally important is the development of vascular
accesses and UF device components that increase the
efficiency and safety of the therapy. The device- and
therapy-related adverse events observed in previous
trials should undergo careful re-evaluation to deter-
mine which were preventable or related to operator
experience versus those that were inherent to how
therapy
was
delivered
or
was
unpredictable
(32,46,47,52).
Only after these issues have been satisfactorily
addressed should a carefully designed, adequately
powered
study
be
considered
to
prospectively
compare
UF
with
pharmacological
fluid
removal
therapies. All treatments should be tailored to indi-
vidual patients’ hemodynamic and renal status. In
addition, the study’s follow-up period should be suf-
ficiently long to permit the evaluation of morbidity
(rehospitalizations)
and
mortality.
Future
trials
should also evaluate whether the greater cost of me-
chanical fluid removal during the index hospitaliza-
tion is offset by the savings resulting from potentially
fewer heart failure events in patients treated with UF.
As the cost of inpatient care is very high, serious
consideration should be given to studies in the
outpatient setting to determine the relative safety
and effectiveness of intermittent pharmacological
and mechanical fluid removal therapies for the pre-
vention rather than the treatment of heart failure
hospitalizations.
Intermittent
outpatient
UF
to
restore responsiveness to oral diuretic agents is also a
strategy
that
deserves
investigation.

 technological advances may permit the development
of “wearable” UF devices capable of delivering indi-
vidualized UF therapy.
CONCLUSIONS
Fluid excess drives most heart failure hospitaliza-
tions. Recurrent hospitalizations are common and
predict unfavorable outcomes. As heart failure pro-
gresses, a significant proportion of patients develop
an inadequate response to diuretic agent therapy.
Additional approaches, such as sequential nephronal
blockade with thiazide diuretic agents or high-dose
aldosterone antagonists, have not been appropri-
ately
validated.
Other
pharmacological
therapies
have not improved the outcomes of patients with
heart failure who have fluid overload. Ultrafiltration
is an attractive alternative therapy because it pre-
dictably
removes
total
body
sodium.
In
future
studies, UF should be adjusted according to the

Of the >1 million heart failure hospitalizations in the United States and Europe, 90% are due to signs and symptoms of fluid overload. This enormous worldwide health
care burden is aggravated by the fact that recurrent congestion worsens patients’ outcomes, regardless of age and renal function. Abnormal hemodynamics,
neurohormonal activation, excessive tubular sodium reabsorption, inflammation, oxidative stress, and nephrotoxic medications drive the complex interactions between
heart and kidney (cardiorenal syndrome). Loop diuretic agents are used in most congested patients. Due to their mechanism and site of action, loop diuretic agents
lead to the production of hypotonic urine and may contribute to diuretic agent resistance (“braking phenomenon,” distal tubular adaptation, and increased renin
secretion in the macula densa). Increased uremic anions and proteinuria also impair achievement of therapeutic concentrations at their tubular site of action.
Ultrafiltration is the production of plasma water from whole blood across a hemofilter in response to a transmembrane pressure. Therefore, ultrafiltration removes
isotonic fluid without direct activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, provided that fluid removal rates do not exceed capillary refill. Any method of
fluid removal may cause an increase in serum creatinine. However, in the absence of evidence of renal tubular injury (e.g., augmented urinary concentration of
neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin), this increase represents a physiological decrease in glomerular filtration rate due to decreased intravascular volume from
fluid removal. AVP ¼ arginine vasopressin; GFR ¼ glomerular filtration rate; K ¼ potassium; KIM ¼ kidney injury molecule; Mg ¼ magnesium; NGAL ¼ neutrophil
gelatinase-associated lipocalin; RAAS ¼ renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; SNS ¼ sympathetic nervous system.
