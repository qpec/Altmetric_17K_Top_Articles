Abstract: Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are battery-operated devices designed to vaporise nicotine,
which may help smokers with quitting or reducing their tobacco consumption. No data is available
regarding the health effects of ECs use among smokers with arterial hypertension and whether regular
use results in blood pressure (BP) changes. We investigated long-term changes in resting BP and level
of BP control in hypertensive smokers who quit or reduced substantially their tobacco consumption
by switching to ECs. A medical records review of patients with hypertension was conducted to
identify patients reporting regular daily use of ECs on at least two consecutive follow-up visits.
Regularly smoking hypertensive patients were included as a reference group. A marked reduction in
cigarette consumption was observed in ECs users (n = 43) though consumption remained unchanged
in the control group (n = 46). Compared to baseline, at 12 months (follow-up visit 2) decline in
cigarette consumption was associated with significant reductions in median (25th-, 75th-centile)
systolic BP (140 (134.5, 144) to 130 (123.5, 138.5) mmHg; p < 0.001) and diastolic BP (86 (78, 90)
to 80 (74.5, 90) mmHg; p = 0.006). No significant changes were observed in the control group.
As expected, decline in cigarette consumption in the ECs users was also associated with improved
BP control. The study concludes that regular ECs use may aid smokers with arterial hypertension
reduce or abstain from cigarette smoking, with only trivial post-cessation weight gain. This resulted
in improvements in systolic and diastolic BP as well as better BP control.

1. Introduction
Smoking is the leading cause of preventable premature mortality in the world.
Death is
mainly caused by ischemic heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, and the catastrophic complications
of advanced stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [1]. It has been estimated that the 10-year
fatal cardiovascular risk is doubled in smokers [2], and that for young smokers the risk for myocardial

infarction is up to 5-fold higher compared to non-smokers [2,3]. The risk is primarily related to the
amount of tobacco smoked daily and shows a clear dose-response relationship with no obvious lower
limit for deleterious effects [4,5]. By sustaining low-grade systemic inflammation [6] and contributing
to arterial stiffness [7], tobacco smoke is also likely to lead to arterial hypertension [8], thus further
worsening smokers’ cardiovascular risk profile.
The interaction between smoking and blood pressure (BP) is complex. Despite the strong
relationship between smoking and elevated risk for cardiovascular disease [9,10], there is paucity
and discrepancy about the long-term effects of smoking cessation on BP in already established
hypertension [11–13].
Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are battery-operated devices designed to vaporise nicotine without
burning tobacco. These consumer products share many similarities with smoking in the behavioural
aspect of their use [14]. Users are predominantly smokers, who report using them long-term as an
alternative for conventional cigarettes, to reduce cigarette consumption or quit smoking, to relieve
tobacco withdrawal symptoms, and to continue having a “smoking” experience [15], but with much
reduced health risks [16,17].
Data from clinical trials of “healthy” smokers [18–20] and in vulnerable populations [21,22]
have shown that ECs may help smokers with quitting or reducing their tobacco consumption
and their use is well tolerated. There is no data about changes in smoking behaviour after daily
ECs use among smokers with arterial hypertension. Most importantly, it is unknown if long-term
smoking cessation/reduction after switching to regular “vaping” (the act of inhaling vapour from
ECs) in patients taking anti-hypertensive medications could result in improved resting BP and better
BP control.
Here we report, for the first time, long-term improvement in resting BP as well as in level of BP
control in smokers with a diagnosis of hypertension who quit or reduced substantially their tobacco
consumption by switching to ECs.
2. Methods
2.1. Patient Population
We conducted a medical records review of patients with arterial hypertension regularly
followed-up at the outpatient clinics of our institution. Patients reporting regular daily use of ECs on
at least two consecutive follow-up visits were eligible to be included in our study. Data from a second
group of age-, sex-matched patients who reported to be regular smokers on at least two consecutive
follow-up visits was included as a reference group. Patients in both study groups had to have similar
weight (<5 kg) and systolic BP (<10 mmHg) fluctuations between pre-baseline and baseline visits.
Any patients with a known cause of secondary hypertension were excluded. The study was approved
by the local institutional ethics review board (Protocol registered No. 675).
2.2. Study Design
From chart review, we extracted patient data from the clinic visit immediately preceding [baseline
visit] the first of the two consecutive follow-up visits (follow-up visit 1 and 2). We also included data
from the clinic visit immediately prior to the baseline visit [pre-baseline visit] to substantiate disease
stability. In brief, data from four visits were collected and analysed. Pre-baseline visits were carried
out at 6–12 months prior to baseline visits. Follow-up visit 1 and 2 were carried out at 6 (±1) and
12 (±2) months after baseline visits, respectively. At each routine outpatient clinic visit patients were
assessed using a standard approach consisting of clinical examination, review of smoking history, and
measurement of blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and body weight. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic
BP (DBP) measurements were conducted according to the recommendations of the Seventh Report
of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood
Pressure [23] with patients seated for at least 5 min prior to measurements. Two BP measurements,
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 1123
3 of 14
spaced 1–2 min apart, were obtained by auscultation using a mercury sphygmomanometer and an
appropriately sized cuff. The average of the two readings was used for analysis. Body weight was
measured by using a mechanical column scale with patients removing shoes and heavy clothing.
2.3. Data Management
For the purposes of this study, patients’ data at the time of the outpatient visits were later extracted
from their medical record and entered into an electronic spreadsheet prior to statistical computation.
2.4. Approach to Treatment
Our routine approach to anti-hypertensive treatment is to evaluate and optimize patients’ drug
regimens to include a combination of drugs that work on different pathophysiological pathways in
order to maximize BP control [24]. Where appropriate diuretics, vasodilators, sympatholytics, and
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers are prescribed. Changes to medications were made
after review of both BP office measurements and BP home readings and were recorded. Self-reported
adherence to medications was assessed at each visit.
2.5. Study Outcomes
The primary outcome of interest was the change in resting SBP and DBP from baseline to the
final follow-up visit at about one year. Secondary outcomes of interest were changes from baseline to
the final follow-up visit in: (a) proportion of blood pressure grading; (b) proportion of patients with
good BP control, defined as an office SBP < 140 mmHg and a DBP < 90 mmHg (<130/80 mmHg for
patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or cardiovascular disease) [24]; (c) HR; (d) body weight;
and (e) the number, class, and dosage of medications. We also collected information about safety and
tolerability of EC use in the patients using them.
2.6. Analyses
Data were expressed as mean (±standard deviation (SD)) if parametric and median (interquartile
range (IQR)) if non-parametric. We also delineated data for single (ECs use only) and dual users
(combined ECs and conventional cigarettes use). Statistical comparisons of change from baseline
between and within the two groups in the parameters assessed were carried out using student’s t-test
and Wilcoxon-signed rank test depending on whether the data was parametric or not, respectively.
Similar statistical analyses were conducted for dual and single users within groups from baseline.
Missing measurements were not included in the analyses. Repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) between baseline and 12 months and between the two study groups were also conducted.
A two-tailed p value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Odds ratios
(OR) were computed to compare changes in BP control. All analyses were performed with the Statistical
Package for Social Science (SPSS for windows version 18.0, Chicago, IL, USA).
3. Results
3.1. Patients’ Characteristics
A total of 89 (50 male, 39 females) regular smokers with a diagnosis of hypertension and on
anti-hypertensive drugs at baseline were studied. They had either pre-hypertension, or grade 1 or 2
hypertension according to 2013 ESH/ESC criteria [24] despite taking at least three antihypertensive
agents (by and large a mixed combination of thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, or β-blockers). Forty-three
patients (26 male, 17 females) reported regular daily use of ECs at two consecutive follow-ups. ECs use
ranged from 10 to 14 months, with 36/43 (83.7%) patients using them for more than a year. Among
the EC user group 28 out of 43 reported previous quit attempts (only three attempts were medically
assisted); 31 out of 46 in the reference group reported previous quit attempts (only four attempts

4 of 14
were medically assisted). There were no significant differences in all study measures between the
pre-baseline and baseline visits. Pre-baseline and baseline patient demographics and characteristics
are summarised in Table 1.

3.2. Changes in Smoking Behaviour and Patterns of E-Cigarette Use
A marked reduction in conventional cigarette consumption was observed in regular daily ECs
users, their mean (±SD) cigarettes/day use decreasing from 20.2 (±5.0) at baseline to 2.6 (±2.9)
at follow-up visit 1 and to 1.8 (±2.0) at follow-up visit 2, respectively (p < 0.001 for both visits)
(Table 2). As expected, no significant reduction in conventional cigarette consumption was observed
in the reference group. Dual usage was reported by 23/43 (53.5%) patients at follow-up visit 1 and
22/43 (51.2%) at follow-up visit 2, respectively (Table 3). A significant reduction in conventional
cigarette consumption was also observed in dual users, with their mean (±SD) cigarettes/day use
decreasing from 21.5 (±6.9) at baseline to 4.8 (±2.3) at follow-up visit 1 and to 3.7 (±1.1) at follow-up
visit 2, respectively (p < 0.001 for both visits) (Table 3). More than a 75% reduction from baseline in
cigarettes/day consumption was reported by 14/23 (60.9%) dual users at follow-up visit 1 and by
17/22 (77.3%) at follow-up visit 2, respectively.

3.3. Changes in BP, HR, and Body Weight
Changes in SBP and DBP from baseline in smokers with arterial hypertension who switched
to ECs and between the two study groups are illustrated and reported in Figure 1A,B and Table 2.
A significant reduction in median SBP (p < 0.001) and DBP (p = 0.006) from baseline was observed
at follow-up visit 2 in the EC group. In contrast, no significant change in BP was observed in the
reference group. The observed reductions in SBP and DBP were significant (p < 0.001, both for SBP and
DBP) when comparing the EC group to the reference group at 12 months. Table 3 illustrates changes
in health outcomes separately for exclusive EC users and dual users; subgroup analyses show that
with the exception of reduced cigarette consumption and SBP at 12 months—no significant changes
from baseline were observed in dual users. The overall proportion of patients with grades 1 and
2 hypertension at baseline (58.1%) was much less at follow-up visit 1 (41.9%) and 2 (34.9%) in the
EC group compared to the reference group, where the proportion of grade 1 and 2 hypertension at
baseline (67.4%) increased at both follow-up visits (Visit 1: 76.1%; Visit 2: 73.9%). This was reciprocated
by an increase in the proportion of patients with normal and pre-hypertension for the former and by a
reduction in the latter group respectively (Figure 2).

No significant change in HR from baseline was noted in both patients’ groups during the course
of the study (Table 2). A significant, but small, increase in body weight was observed in both study
groups at the 2nd follow-up visit (Table 2); however, the observed small weight gain was not significant

separately for exclusive EC users and dual users from baseline; subgroup analysis shows a small
but significant increase in body weight in exclusive EC users (from 71.0 kg to 74.2 kg), whereas no
significant increase is observed in dual users (from 75.6 kg to 76.7 kg).
3.4. Changes in BP Control and Anti-Hypertensive Medications
The overall proportion of patients in the EC group with good BP control at baseline increased
from 25.6% to 37.2% and 48.8% at follow-up visit 1 and 2, respectively (Figure 3; Table 4). In contrast,
the proportion of patients in the reference group with good BP control at baseline (19.6%) was virtually
unchanged during the course of the study (Visit 1: 19.6%; Visit 2: 21.7%). The OR of improved BP
control in the EC group compared to the controls at Visit 1 and 2 was 2.29 and 5.29, respectively.

No significant change in HR from baseline was noted in both patients’ groups during the course 
of the study (Table 2). A significant, but small, increase in body weight was observed in both study 
groups at the 2nd follow-up visit (Table 2); however, the observed small weight gain was not 
significant between the EC group and the reference group. Table 3 illustrates changes in mean body

3.5. Safety and Tolerability
No severe adverse reactions or acute decompensation in BP were reported with EC use throughout
the entire follow-up duration. Overall, EC use appeared to be well tolerated in these hypertensive
patients with dry mouth and throat irritation being occasionally reported.
4. Discussion
Smoking is known to act synergistically to elevate the risk of myocardial infarction in patients
with established hypertension [25]. Moreover, there is emerging evidence that arterial hypertension
may be one of the many recognized deleterious effects of tobacco smoking [26]. For these reasons,
quitting smoking is among the most important steps patients with elevated BP can take to improve
their cardiovascular health [5]. Abstinence has been the preferred strategy to address these harmful
effects, but has been largely unsuccessful with modest quit rates being reported [27,28].
Here we illustrate for the first time the utility of ECs as a bridge in reducing cigarette consumption
in smokers with arterial hypertension. Adoption of regular long-term ECs use in this group led to a
marked and stable reduction in conventional cigarette consumption, with about 50% of them abstaining
completely from tobacco smoking by the end of the observation period. The success rate observed in
these patients with arterial hypertension is similar to that recently reported in asthmatics [22] and may
be explained by the notion that ECs are a valid long-term alternative nicotine source to conventional
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 1123
10 of 14
cigarettes due to their many similarities to smoking behaviour [14,29]. Moreover, ECs use was well
tolerated with no reported severe adverse reactions or acute decompensation in BP.
As a result of the substantial reduction in cigarette consumption, decreased systolic and diastolic
BP as well as improved BP control was also reported. In the EC group, systolic and diastolic BP fell by
10 mmHg and 6 mmHg, respectively. Improvement in systolic (but not diastolic) BP was also observed
in dual users at 12 (but not 6) months. These findings are in agreement with the 8.8 mmHg reduction
in systolic BP at week-52 in a prospective randomised control trial looking at the effect of smoking
cessation by using ECs in subjects with high BP at baseline [30]. Predictably, not only was there a
decrease in the proportion of patients with hypertension, but also the overall proportion of patients
in the EC group with good BP control increased five-fold compared to the reference group. Of note,
improvement in resting BP as well as in level of BP control was unrelated to the minor adjustments in
the use of anti-hypertensives.
Given the well-established acute effect of smoking on immediate vasopressor and tachycardic
responses [31,32] and increased arterial stiffness [33], the observed reduction in BP after long-lasting
smoking reduction or abstinence is not surprising. Nonetheless, in view of the complex interaction
between smoking and blood pressure (BP) and the reported discrepancy about the long-term effects
of smoking cessation on BP in already established hypertension [11–13], our positive findings
require explanation. Besides important methodological limitations of population studies that may
predispose them to heterogeneous results [26], the association of elevated risk for future development
of hypertension after smoking cessation [13] has been mainly attributed to post-cessation weight
gain [8,34]. Low BP in smokers is related to decreased body weight [35] with higher body weight
and elevated BP being more common in former smokers compared to non-smokers [36]. Thus, when
interpreting BP variations in the context of smoking abstinence, post cessation weight gain becomes
a critical confounder because the negative effects of weight gain on BP could outweigh the positive
effects of smoking cessation. In the current study, we have observed that quitters who use ECs seem to
limit substantially their post-cessation weight gain; a significant but small, increase in body weight
(i.e., 1.2 kg) was observed at the second follow-up visit, but the observed small weight gain was not
significant between EC group and reference group (1.2 kg vs. 0.7 kg). The trivial post-cessation weight
gain after switching to regular EC use might have contributed to the positive long-term effects of
smoking cessation on BP and BP control. Moreover, improved weight control has been shown in a
recent one-year randomized smoking cessation trial of smokers who quit smoking by switching to
ECs [37]. By alleviating weight gain, EC use may ultimately deter the hypertensive comorbidities of
both smoking and obesity. Additionally, it must be noted that we investigated a relatively “young”
population with a short duration of hypertension history and probably less established vascular
remodelling; this might also have contributed to the positive effects on BP and BP control.
In agreement with the findings from other research groups [38,39], positive improvements in BP
after smoking cessation were noted not only in quitters, but also in those who reduced consumption
in conventional cigarettes (i.e., dual users). A possible explanation is that dual users in our study
substantially reduced their average cigarettes/day consumption, with 77.3% reporting a reduction
of at least 75% from baseline by the end of the observation period. Of note, that reduction in tobacco
smoking thanks to ECs may have led to improvements in BP which is also consistent with the results
of a recent prospective RCT [30]. The multiple linear regression model in which the SBP change from
BL to week 52 was entered as a dependent variable and tested against continuous smoking phenotype
classification, sex, age, and weight change as independent variables, demonstrated that the mean
reduction in systolic BP from baseline at one-year remained significantly associated with both smoking
reduction and smoking abstinence, with the b coefficient for quitters being more than two-fold greater
compared to reducers.
The observed improvement in systolic and diastolic BP as well as in BP control in hypertensive
smokers who switched to regular ECs use suggests that the harmful effects of cigarette smoke on
the vascular system can potentially be reversed. By substantially reducing exposure to conventional
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 1123
11 of 14
cigarettes’ hazardous toxicants and achieving clinically relevant BP reductions, EC use may not only
improve the cardiovascular risk profile but also confer an overall health advantage in smokers unable
or unwilling to quit who are also at risk of developing arterial hypertension compared to continuing
smoking. The use of low risk nicotine-containing products (including ECs) should be investigated as
a safer alternative approach to harm-reversal (i.e., specific reversal of BP elevation) and, in general,
to harm-reduction (i.e., overall reduction of cardiovascular risk associated with tobacco smoking).
There are some limitations in our study. First, the sample size is small; hence the results must be
interpreted with caution. However, despite being small, significant results were reported for several
study endpoints. Standard concerns associated with retrospective studies (including variance in
the quality of information recorded by medical professionals and difficulty in establishing a causal
relationship) need consideration. Nonetheless, a clear advantage conducting this type of study is
the generation of hypotheses that can be tested prospectively under controlled conditions. Secondly,
patients in this study may represent a self-selected sample, which is not representative of all smokers
with arterial hypertension (e.g., smokers not intending to quit, switching to ECs). Thirdly, although
careful extraction from patients’ medical records allowed systematic assessment of anti-hypertensive
medication prescriptions, this alone may not reflect true usage due to lack of rigorous adherence checks.
Carbon monoxide measurements are not routinely performed in patients who are followed-up for
elevated blood pressure at outpatient clinics and their smoking abstinence was self-reported. However,
self-reported number of cigarettes smoked per day in studies of this type is not subjected to the kind of
biases observed in clinical trials where there is the tendency to claim abstinence [40]. Moreover, similar
beneficial effects were also reported in dual users (i.e., smoking reducers) and therefore objective
measures of abstinence are unlikely to be of great importance. Given the design of this study, it was
impossible to provide details about specific products and patterns of use, but this (lack of) knowledge
will not change study findings or their interpretation. Last but not least, lifestyle changes (e.g., salt
intake, diet, recreational exercise), which may have an influence on BP measures, were not taken
into account. Nonetheless, by including a reference group, which was carefully matched for age,
sex, weight, and systolic BP fluctuations between pre-baseline and baseline visits, we minimized the
observation bias.
5. Conclusions
That ECs may help also smokers with arterial hypertension to reduce their cigarette consumption
or remain abstinent is a novel and important message of the study. As a result of this, we have
observed substantial long-term improvements in systolic and diastolic BP as well as greater BP
control. Large prospective studies are now warranted to confirm and expand the potential role of the
e-vapor category for smoking cessation and/or reversal of harm in hypertensive patients who smoke.
Substitution of conventional cigarettes with EC is unlikely to raise significant health concerns and may
achieve better BP control. This can improve counseling between physicians and their patients with
high BP using or intending to use ECs [41].
