Abstract
Objective: Early detection of patient deterioration and prevention of adverse events are key chal-
lenges to patient safety. This study investigated clinical staff perceptions of current monitoring
practices and the planned introduction of continuous monitoring devices on general wards.
Design: Multi-method study comprising structured surveys, in-depth interviews and device trial
with log book feedback.
Setting: Two general wards in a large urban teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia.
Participants: Respiratory and neurosurgery nursing staff and two doctors.
Results: Nurses were confident about their abilities to identify patients at risk of deterioration,
using a combination of vital signs and visual assessment. There were concerns about the accuracy
of current vital signs monitoring equipment and frequency of intermittent observation. Both the
nurses and the doctors were enthusiastic about the prospect of continuous monitoring and per-
ceived it would allow earlier identification of patient deterioration; provide reassurance to patients;
and support interdisciplinary communication. There were also reservations about continuous
monitoring, including potential decrease in bedside nurse–patient interactions; increase in
inappropriate escalations of patient care; and discomfort to patients.
Conclusions: While continuous monitoring devices were seen as a potentially positive tool to sup-
port the identification of patient deterioration, drawbacks, such as the potential for reduced patient
contact, revealed key areas that will require close surveillance following the implementation of
devices. Training and improved interdisciplinary communication were identified as key requisites
for successful implementation.

 Introduction
Monitoring vital signs is integral to patient care in acute hospitals [1].
Traditionally, the five vital signs are blood pressure (BP), pulse, respira-
tory rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2) and temperature [2]. These signs
are universally used to monitor patients’ progress. Changing trends in
patients’ vital signs data can indicate clinical deterioration, which, with-
out identification and intervention, can lead to adverse consequences or
death [3, 4]. Rapid response systems (RRSs) enable escalation of care
to a medical emergency team (MET) when patients’ vital signs breach
accepted thresholds. These systems have been implemented in many
countries and have reduced the incidence of deaths and cardiac arrests
in acute hospitals [5–7]. However, the success of RRSs is reliant on
timely vital signs data and identification of deterioration [8]. Yet, recent
research shows that the monitoring and recording of the five vital signs
is often incomplete which poses the potential to miss deterioration [9].
The patient casemix on general wards has changed over recent
decades, with patients now older, more acutely ill, experiencing
more co-morbidities and facing complex procedures [10–12]. Yet,
general ward patients are still monitored in much the same way as
they have for over a century: with nurses intermittently measuring
and recording vital signs. Moreover, the frequency of recording var-
ies, with limited evidence to suggest the most effective frequency for
measurement [13]. Continuous monitoring technologies are a more
proactive approach to the early detection of patient deterioration
and have been reported as potentially enhancing early identification
of deteriorating patients [14]. There is limited research, however,
that assesses clinical staff perceptions regarding patient monitoring
and the potential impact of continuous monitoring on practices.
As part of a larger project aimed at improving safety through
timely recognition of deterioration, this study conducted a formative
evaluation to assess perceptions of the implementation of continu-
ous monitoring devices on general wards. Formative evaluation in
the early stages of technology implementation projects has been
advocated as means to inform feasibility, provide opportunities for
iterative assessments of intervention viability, guide the development
and refinement of interventions, and characterize success factors in
the quest to optimize patient safety [15, 16].
Objectives
The aim of this study was to investigate clinical staff perceptions of
current monitoring practices and the planned introduction of
continuous monitoring devices on general wards. The study objec-
tives were to
(i) assess nurses’ knowledge and confidence regarding current vital
signs monitoring tools and practices;
(ii) gauge doctors’ and nurses’ perceptions regarding introduction
of continuous monitoring devices;
(iii) obtain staff feedback on issues identified while wearing the con-
tinuous monitoring devices; and
(iv) investigate interdisciplinary communication regarding patient
deterioration and care.
Methods
We undertook a multi-method study comprising structured surveys,
in-depth interviews and log books (Table 1). These activities were
conducted between January and August 2014 on two wards
(respiratory and neurosurgery) of a large teaching hospital in
Sydney, Australia.
Prior to commencing the research, we held briefing sessions for
staff to explain the study purpose and provide a demonstration of the
continuous monitoring devices. The ‘ViSi Mobile’ monitors (Sotera
Wireless, California) are wrist-worn wireless mobile devices that cap-
ture continuous information on non-invasive BP, pulse, respiratory rate,
SpO2, skin temperature and electrocardiogram rhythms [17]. Vital signs
data are shown on the device display and are also wirelessly trans-
mitted to a remote viewing display (e.g. a desktop computer).
The study was approved by the local Health District ethics com-
mittee (approval reference HREC/13/LPOOL/357). We used a reci-
procity framework, whereby clinical staff perceptions were regarded
as authoritative and central to the research, and we fed back study
findings to ensure reliability of the obtained data [18]. In line with
the reciprocity framework, we provided all clinical staff the oppor-
tunity to participate in one or more research activities. Participation
was voluntary and consent was obtained from staff prior to their
participation in each research activity.
Knowledge survey
A structured survey (Table 2), relating to confidence in vital signs
monitoring tools and practices, was verbally administered to 33
nurses. The researcher provided statements and asked respondents
to indicate whether they strongly agreed, agreed, were uncertain,

aThere were 40 respiratory ward and 41 neurosurgery ward nurses (total 81 nurses). All were eligible to participate in the in-depth interviews, device trial/
log book and communications questionnaire. For the knowledge survey, the nursing unit manager(s), clinical nurse consultant and clinical nurse educator were not eli-
gible. Thus, 36 respiratory ward and 38 neurosurgery ward nurses (total 74 nurses) were eligible to participate in the knowledge survey.
bThe 10 participants constituted 8 nurses and 2 doctors.

 disagreed or strongly disagreed with each statement. Data from the
survey were analysed in SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics 22) applying
descriptive statistics.
In-depth interviews
Structured in-depth interviews (Table 3) aimed at gauging perceptions
regarding benefits, concerns and enablers in respect of the introduc-
tion of continuous monitoring devices were conducted with eight
nurses and two doctors. The interviews were digitally recorded and
transcribed. A general inductive approach [19] was used to analyse
the interview data, whereby two researchers independently coded the
data, discussed their coding and developed a coding schema. The
schema was then used by one researcher to recode the data in QSR
NVivo (NVivo 10). Results were reported to ward staff for validation.
Device trial and log books
Continuous monitoring devices were made available on each ward for
staff to trial on themselves, in order to anticipate any problems patients
may experience while wearing the device. Twenty-three nurses trialled
the devices and provided written feedback in log books placed on each
ward. The log book data were entered into a spreadsheet and inde-
pendently analysed for common subject matter by two researchers.
Communication survey
A short paper-based survey was completed by 40 nurses. The survey
contained a dichotomous (yes/no) question regarding whether current
practices for identifying deteriorating patients could be improved;
with an open-ended section requesting additional details. The survey
also included five statements about interdisciplinary communication
with 5-point Likert scales (Table 4). Quantitative survey data were
analysed in SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics 22) applying descriptive statis-
tics. Open-ended responses were entered into a spreadsheet and inde-
pendently analysed for common subject matter by two researchers.
Results

 (Table 2). Of 19 neurosurgery nurses, most agreed or strongly
agreed (n = 14; 73.7%) that SpO2 probes gave inaccurate readings
(compared to n = 3 respiratory nurses; 21.4%). Similarly, many
neurosurgery nurses disagreed or strongly disagreed (n = 9; 47.3%)
that automated observation machines were accurate (compared to
n = 4 respiratory nurses; 28.6%). More neurosurgery than respira-
tory nurses also agreed or strongly agreed that they were uncertain
about what to do if the automated observation machine did not give
a proper reading (n = 10; 52.7% and n = 3; 21.4% respectively).
All nurses agreed or strongly agreed that they were confident in
escalating patient care (activating a clinical review or RRS). All but
one nurse also agreed or strongly agreed they would escalate care for
a patient they were worried about, even if their vital signs appeared
normal. However, one third of all nurses (n = 11 of 33) agreed or
strongly agreed they were sometimes reluctant to escalate care due to
concerns they might be criticized if the patient is not that unwell.
In-depth interviews
Four main themes emerged from the interviews: (i) current practices
for identifying deteriorating patients; (ii) patient care and communi-
cation benefits of continuous monitoring; (iii) potential negative
impacts of continuous monitoring on care practices; and (iv) training
and support for successful implementation.
Current practices for identifying deteriorating patients
Nurses described confidence in their ability to identify patients at
risk of deterioration using a range of levels, including ‘medium’,
‘reasonably’, ‘fairly’, ‘pretty’ and ‘very’. Nurses confirmed that they
use the vital signs threshold criteria mandated by State health
department policy (the Between the Flags Program [20, 21]) to iden-
tify patient deterioration. Several stated they also rely on intuition
or clinical judgement based on visual assessment of patients. If there
is uncertainty about a patient, nurses said they perform double
checks of vital signs, seek second opinions from other nurses or con-
tact doctors.
I actually look at my patient and see whether or not they look
like what the observations are showing and just use clinical
judgement to see [if] they need to be more supervised. (Nurse3)
Both the doctors and nurses expressed concerns about the intermit-
tent nature of the current system of vital signs monitoring. They
indicated that a patient’s condition could markedly change between
routine sets of observations and that these ‘gaps’ posed a potential
to miss signs of deterioration.
I’ve had a patient who died on me … When I saw him he was
reasonably ok and I thought–great, he’s stable, I’ll go and see
somebody else. Then he crashed and burned in the next couple
of hours and you couldn’t revive him. (Doctor1)
The doctors suggested that increased frequency of manual obser-
vation may not be feasible because of nursing work pressures.
Nurses indicated that increased observations were conducted for
patients when necessary, however, they disclosed it was onerous on
their time and sometimes required nursing staff to be rearranged
and patients reassigned.
Patient care and communication benefits of continuous
monitoring
Continuous monitoring was considered to be a means of identifying
trends that might otherwise be missed by intermittent monitoring.
Both the doctors and nurses anticipated this could lead to earlier iden-
tification and response to patient deterioration, and potentially pre-
vent deterioration to a stage requiring escalation to RRS intervention.
Another perceived benefit was greater availability and accessibility to
vital signs information, which nurses suggested would provide better
evidence when communicating concerns for a patient to doctors and
would support their decisions to escalate care.
Us nurses, we find it so difficult trying to get the doctors to
understand what’s happening. … We’re like–this patient doesn’t
look well; but they’re like–I’ll check her later. So at least when
you show them–look, you need to come and see this patient
now, this is what’s happening and that’s what the device is telling
us. (Nurse8)
Some nurses perceived the devices would provide reassurance to
patients, and their relatives, that the patient is being closely moni-
tored. It was also suggested that visibility of information on the device
might encourage patients to ask questions about their vital signs and,
hence, be more engaged in their care. Alternatively, some nurses were
concerned that visibility of information and alarms may cause anxiety
amongst patients, leading to time spent reassuring them.

 Potential negative impacts of continuous monitoring
on care practices
Both the doctors and nurses expressed concern about the potential
for over-reliance on the continuous monitoring remote viewing dis-
plays resulting in decreased bedside interactions and, subsequently,
reduced physical and visual assessment of patients. One nurse was
apprehensive that the device would replace a quintessential nursing
responsibility, while others felt that not having to measure vital signs
would allow them more time to focus on other care needs.
My initial concern was that nurses may not have that one-on-one
interaction with the patients. That may reduce because they will
rely on the device. (Nurse4)
I’m hoping it will give staff more time to have that patient
care and that patient contact that everyone complains they don’t
get enough of. (Nurse3)
Nurses were also concerned that continuous monitoring would be
less flexible with regards to adjusting for clinical judgement and
worried about their decisions to override alarms being scrutinized.
One nurse provided the example of SpO2 levels falling below indi-
cated thresholds when patients get up to use the bathroom, which
are known to return to acceptable levels once the patient rests. In
such cases, nurses would not generally escalate. Likewise, the doc-
tors were concerned that continuous monitoring may result in more
clinical reviews and RRS calls that may be inappropriate. They sug-
gested this could lead to doctors becoming overburdened and ultim-
ately, if many calls were unwarranted, could result in doctors
becoming desensitized to calls. One of the doctors also suggested
that alert fatigue may be an issue for nurses if the devices generated
alarms too frequently.
Training and support for successful implementation
Training was highlighted as a key requirement for the introduction of
continuous monitoring devices. Nurses wanted the opportunity to
interact with devices prior to implementation and felt that success of
implementation hinged on the provision of education about all aspects
of the devices, including placement on patients; device operation;
interpretation of data; and actions required in response to data. They
also indicated that access to technical support or ward champions
who could assist with troubleshooting issues was important.
Device trial
Nurses who trialled the continuous monitoring devices provided a
total of 53 feedback comments (median 2 comments per nurse,
range 1–5). Nurses reported wearing the device for durations ran-
ging between 15 minutes to several hours.
The most frequently mentioned issue related to the device being
bulky/heavy and uncomfortable to wear (n = 17 comments). Nurses
found it difficult to perform activities while wearing the device (n = 7)
such as eating, washing hands, or typing, and complained about the
device’s leads getting in the way or being constrictive (n = 5). They
also reported technical problems (n = 8), such as responsiveness of
the screen to input, and questioned the robustness and ease of clean-
ing the device (n = 3). Nurses raised concerns about devices causing
patients anxiety or possibly injury, such as pressure sores (n = 5).
Some commented they were excited about the devices and their poten-
tial to assist in the early detection of deterioration (n = 4). Others
expressed indifference (n = 3), while one nurse expressed concern that
the devices would replace nurses (n = 1).
Communication survey
The demographic characteristics of the nurses participating in the
communication survey are presented in Table 5. Most nurses (n = 29
of 40; 72.5%) reported that the way deteriorating patients are
currently identified could be improved and 21 (52.5%) provided com-
ments on how this could be achieved. Comments regarding communi-
cation (n = 9 comments) were frequent, such as communication of
clear plans of care and criteria for escalating patients; improved bed-
side handover compliance; and listening to nursing staff when they
voice concerns regarding deteriorating patients. Other comments
included increasing the frequency of monitoring (n = 6); locating
high-risk patients close to the nurses’ station for easier visibility
(n = 3); and maintaining low nurse-to-patient ratios or rostering
more senior staff (n = 3).
Almost all nurses agreed or strongly agreed (n = 37 of 39; 94.9%)
that if communication between doctors and nurses was more frequent,
nurses would be able to identify and respond to deteriorating patients
earlier and that patient care would be improved. A large number of
nurses indicated that doctors and nurses work together only some-
times to decide what medical information should be communicated to
patients (n = 14; 35.9%) and that doctors only sometimes kept nurses
informed about the advice they had given patients (n = 24; 61.5%).
All nurses indicated that they found it easy to talk to doctors about
patients at least sometimes.
Discussion
In this study, clinical staff perceived there were opportunities to
improve current vital signs monitoring practices. Nurses expressed
concerns about current monitoring frequency and equipment, and
indicated that a patient’s condition could destabilize and go
unnoticed between routine sets of observations. They also felt that
interdisciplinary communication, in relation to patient deterioration
and care, could be improved. However, there were mixed responses
regarding the prospect of continuous monitoring technology on gen-
eral wards. On the one hand, it was seen as safer for patients by

 allowing trends to be identified and responded to earlier. This find-
ing reflects evidence from two recent studies that assessed the impact
of continuous monitoring in general wards and found early identifi-
cation of deterioration, increased rapid response activation and a
decreased need for patient rescue to be benefits of continuous moni-
toring [22, 23]. However, a systematic review of literature published
between 1998 and 2010, as well as a quasi-experimental study pub-
lished in 2014, found that these benefits have also been associated
with intermittent monitoring strategies, such as early warning scor-
ing systems [24, 25]. The continuous monitoring devices were also
considered to be a means to encourage patient engagement in their
care, which could facilitate the patient to be observant of and
involved in their own safety [26].
On the other hand, there was apprehension about potentially
negative impacts of continuous monitoring, particularly on nurse–
patient interactions, inflexibility of using clinical judgement, patient
anxiety leading to need for reassurance and that the technology would
replace an essential nursing responsibility. As a previous qualitative
study of clinicians’ and managers’ views of information technology
introduction identified, concerns regarding disruption to workflow and
work processes predominate over other issues [27].
Conflicting views were also found on whether continuous moni-
toring would free up time to spend with patients, allowing nurses to
focus on other patient care needs, or whether released time might be
time spent away from patients. This is a particularly important issue,
as time spent away from patients reduces opportunities for visual
assessment of deterioration. Nurses indicated that they do not solely
use vital signs data to monitor patients. When detecting deterior-
ation nurses also rely on their intuition and use sensory assessment
to identify subtle changes in their patients, such as changes in skin
colour, level of agitation or the clamminess of skin [28, 29]; but
detection is reliant on nurses interacting with patients. To mediate
potential decreases in bedside interactions, the capability of the
devices to complement nurses’ clinical judgement, strengthening the
nurses’ role as the one overseeing the technology, is an important
message to be conveyed to nurses during the implementation of con-
tinuous monitoring devices. Emphasizing such a message may help
alleviate nurses’ concerns about being replaced by technology [30]
and, thus, would be important to include as part of training, which
staff identified as critical to facilitating adoption and acceptance of
technology [31].
Most nurses felt reasonably confident in their ability to identify
patients at risk of deterioration. They emphasized the need to recheck
abnormal readings; adjust criteria for escalation; and increase moni-
toring frequency for patients whose condition was deteriorating. The
neurosurgery nurses expressed less confidence than the respiratory
nurses in the accuracy of their vital signs equipment and were more
uncertain about the actions to take if they felt equipment readings
were inaccurate. A reason for this may be differences in how
patients deteriorate on the two wards (with respiratory patients
generally exhibiting a slower decline compared to neurosurgery
patients) and differences in nursing experience, which has been
identified as a predictor of attitudes towards vital sign monitoring
[32]. Nonetheless, almost all nurses expressed confidence in escalat-
ing care when they were concerned, even for patients with vital signs
within normal thresholds. However, the nurses admitted to some-
times being reluctant to escalate care because of possible criticism
by doctors. A previous survey of nurses’ attitudes towards RRS
similarly found that ~13% felt uncomfortable placing a MET call
[33]. Nurses in the present study suggested that a benefit of con-
tinuous monitoring was the provision of better evidence when
communicating concerns about patients to doctors. This would also
address previous suggestions that some reluctance in escalating care
is due to a disconnect between the social language generally used by
nurses and the technical language often used by doctors [34, 35]. The
findings also highlight the need for ongoing education, particularly
for less experienced nurses, to allow them to develop their vital signs
knowledge and confidence in their clinical reasoning skills [32].
The issues of potential alert fatigue or an increase in inappropri-
ate escalations of care were raised by one of the doctors. These
issues are important to monitor with the implementation of continu-
ous monitoring devices, as alarms or escalations of care that are
often false-positive can compromise patient safety by causing delays
in response times [36]. In one setting, where continuous monitoring
devices were implemented, the average alarm rate was 10.8 per
patient per day, which the majority of nurses perceived to be accept-
able (n = 22 of 24 nurses) [37]. However, the appropriateness of
continuous monitoring alarms and nurses responses is an area
requiring further study.
Limitations
Our study had several limitations. We received modest participation
rates for the individual research activities (up to 49%) and partici-
pants were predominantly nurses, with only two doctors participating,
which limits the ability to infer the perspectives of doctors. Overall,
however, of the cohort of 81 nurses on the two study wards, almost
all participated in at least one of our research activities. Across the
four research activities we had a total sample of 106 participants, thus
our use of multi-methods added strength to our study design [38, 39].
We also validated the findings of each research activity through feed-
back presentations to ward staff, including both those that had and
had not participated in the research activity, to strengthen the credibil-
ity and trustworthiness of our study findings [40]. Our study was con-
ducted in two wards of one hospital and, hence, the findings may not
be generalizable to other settings. Nonetheless, this study identifies
important information to inform technology implementations and
these transferable lessons should be considered by those seeking to
adopt continuous monitoring technology.
Conclusions
Technologies are frequently introduced into health care settings
without sufficient prior consultation of end users. Yet, end-users’
attitudes can influence the acceptability and integration of technol-
ogy into clinical work practices [41]. This study examined clinical
staff views about current intermittent measurement of vital signs
and about implementing continuous monitoring devices on gen-
eral wards. The attitudes and beliefs of staff were a combination
of expected benefits for improved patient care, and concerns about
integration of the devices into existing practices. While continuous
monitoring devices were seen as a positive tool to support the
early identification of deterioration, drawbacks were also identi-
fied, such as the potential for reduced patient contact. Effective
training and improved interdisciplinary communication were iden-
tified as key requisites for successful implementation. These draw-
backs and requisites highlight key areas that require close
consideration and surveillance following the implementation of
these devices, and present an area for further study with a larger
sample of clinicians.
