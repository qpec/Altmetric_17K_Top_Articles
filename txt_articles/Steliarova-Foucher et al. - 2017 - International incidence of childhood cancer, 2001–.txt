Summary
Background Cancer is a major cause of death in children worldwide, and the recorded incidence tends to increase with 
time. Internationally comparable data on childhood cancer incidence in the past two decades are scarce. This study 
aimed to provide internationally comparable local data on the incidence of childhood cancer to promote research of 
causes and implementation of childhood cancer control.
Methods This population-based registry study, devised by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 
collaboration with the International Association of Cancer Registries, collected data on all malignancies and non-
malignant neoplasms of the CNS diagnosed before age 20 years in populations covered by high-quality cancer 
registries with complete data for 2001–10. Incidence rates per million person-years for the 0–14 years and 0–19 years 
age groups were age-adjusted using the world standard population to provide age-standardised incidence rates 
(WSRs), using the age-specific incidence rates (ASR) for individual age groups (0–4 years, 5–9 years, 10–14 years, and 
15–19 years). All rates were reported for 19 geographical areas or ethnicities by sex, age group, and cancer type. The 
regional WSRs for children aged 0–14 years were compared with comparable data obtained in the 1980s.
Findings Of 532 invited cancer registries, 153 registries from 62 countries, departments, and territories met quality 
standards, and contributed data for the entire decade of 2001–10. 385 509 incident cases in children aged 0–19 years 
occurring in 2·64 billion person-years were included. The overall WSR was 140·6 per million person-years in children 
aged 0–14 years (based on 284 649 cases), and the most common cancers were leukaemia (WSR 46·4), followed by 
CNS tumours (WSR 28·2), and lymphomas (WSR 15·2). In children aged 15–19 years (based on 100 860 cases), the 
ASR was 185·3 per million person-years, the most common being lymphomas (ASR 41·8) and the group of epithelial 
tumours and melanoma (ASR 39·5). Incidence varied considerably between and within the described regions, and by 
cancer type, sex, age, and racial and ethnic group. Since the 1980s, the global WSR of registered cancers in children 
aged 0–14 years has increased from 124·0 (95% CI 123·3–124·7) to 140·6 (140·1–141·1) per million person-years.
Interpretation This unique global source of childhood cancer incidence will be used for aetiological research and to 
inform public health policy, potentially contributing towards attaining several targets of the Sustainable Development 
Goals. The observed geographical, racial and ethnic, age, sex, and temporal variations require constant monitoring 
and research.

Introduction
Cancers rarely occur before age 20 years, and when they 
do, they raise a range of medical, psychological, ethical, 
and societal concerns. These distinct types of neoplasms 
require specific treatment paths. Furthermore, the extent 
of the cancer burden in this young population is 
unknown in many low-income and middle-income 
countries (LMICs), where data on cancer incidence are 
not collected. Even in the presence of population-based 
cancer registries, collection of information about 
childhood cancers is often neglected because they 
represent a small proportion of all cancers, additional 
data sources might be required, and the resulting 
statistics must be subjected to meticulous quality control 
because they are more sensitive to imprecision or 
missing information.
Since the publication of the International Incidence of 
Childhood Cancer, volume 1 (IICC-1) in 19881 and IICC-2 
in 1998,2 no internationally comparable data on incidence 
patterns of childhood cancer have been published.

Research on Cancer (IARC), in collaboration with the

International Association of Cancer Registries (IACR), 
has coordinated a study to assess the incidence of 
childhood cancer worldwide, the complete results of 
which will be published in IICC-3. The target age range 
for IICC-3 is 0–19 years, compared with 0–14 years in 
IICC-1 and IICC-2. Inclusion of the 15–19 years age 
group was motivated by the shortage of internationally 
comparable data in this transition age between childhood 
and adulthood. An age range of 0–19 years was also 
chosen in previous US and European studies of 
childhood cancer incidence and survival.3,4
Here we provide an overview of the findings of the 
IICC-3 study, based on a selection of quality-assured 
datasets 
from 
around 
the 
world 
encompassing 
information for the complete decade of 2001–10. The 
objective of this study was to counteract the difficulties in 
collecting childhood cancer data from relevant data 
sources and provide globally comparable estimates of 
cancer occurrence in children to aid further research and 
adapt policy measures.
Methods
Study design and data sources
In this epidemiological, population-based registry study, 
we invited all population-based cancer registries that we 
identified among the membership of the IACR and from 
published literature in MEDLINE or other published 
sources, such as annual reports, in any language. The 
search terms used for the literature search were 
“population”, “childhood cancer”, “incidence”, and 
“registry”. Of the invited registries, we selected only 
those that had submitted their data and met standard 
data quality criteria. We included only registries covering 
the entire decade of 2001–10, which eliminated some 
high-quality registries that covered non-overlapping time 
periods. Analyses for the 0–14 years age group were 
based on a larger database (the paediatric dataset) than 
those for the 0–19 years age group (general dataset), 
because the paediatric dataset included data from the 
paediatric cancer registries not collecting data in children 
older than 15 years and these registries tended to have a 
wider coverage than the cancer registries used in the 
general dataset (appendix pp 2–4).
All malignancies and non-malignant tumours of the 
CNS diagnosed before age 20 years (before age 15 years in 
most of the paediatric cancer registries) in the covered 
populations in 2001–10 were eligible for inclusion. In 
the USA, non-malignant tumours were only registered 
from 2004 onwards, so they were excluded. The 
submission from each registry contained cancer and 
population data, information about registration coverage, 
practices, and data sources, and a short narrative 
describing registry operations. Cancer data included 
individual records of cases with codes for the following: 
sex; age; date of birth; date of incidence; and tumour 
sequence (ie, the numerical order of occurrence of the 
neoplasm), site, morphology, behaviour, laterality, and 
most valid basis of diagnosis. The 3rd edition of the 
International Classification of Diseases for Oncology5 was 
required for coding of the tumour site, morphology, 
behaviour, multiple primary tumours, and basis of 
diagnosis. 
Non-conforming 
coding 
systems 
were 
converted and tumours were classified centrally according 
to the 3rd edition of the International Classification of 
Childhood 
Cancer 
(ICCC-3).6 
We 
requested 
each 
contributing cancer registry to provide total population 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The worldwide incidence of cancer in children aged 0–14 years 
was reported in 1988 and 1998 in two volumes of the 
International Incidence of Childhood Cancer (IICC), which described 
incidence patterns in the 1970s and 1980s, respectively. We 
searched MEDLINE and participating registries for studies on the 
incidence of childhood cancer worldwide, with the search terms 
“childhood cancer”, “registry”, “incidence”, and “population”, in 
February, 2016, without language or publication date restrictions. 
We found that no globally comparable data on cancer types 
affecting children have been published since IICC-2, and 
no comparison of incidence patterns in children aged 15–19 years 
has been attempted on a global scale. 
Added value of this study
This study provides an overview of the incidence of cancer 
in 2001–10 for children aged 0–19 years, based on data 
collected in 153 population-based cancer registries in 
62 countries, departments, and territories on five continents. In 
addition to the sex, age, and tumour-specific incidence rates for 
19 world regions or populations for 2001–10, we report an 
increase in the incidence of neoplasms since the 1980s in 
children aged 0–14 years. This study updates information on 
cancer incidence in children published almost 20 years ago and 
adds the first global overview of cancer incidence in young 
people aged 15–19 years. It comprehensively summarises the 
most recent and globally comparable data and presents 
information per sex, age group, geographical region, and 
tumour type.
Implications of all the available evidence
The wealth of information provided by this study constitutes a 
solid baseline to assess needs and define priorities in the area 
of paediatric oncology, supporting Sustainable Development 
Goal 3 to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at 
all ages. The identified variations in cancer incidence according 
to region, sex, age group, and tumour type will provide a 
springboard for specific aetiological research. The shortage of 
high-quality local information should stimulate formation of 
new and more accurate data sources.

counts for each ethnic or racial group, calendar year, sex, 
and year of age in the registration area of their registry.
Procedures
All submitted datasets were processed and assessed 
individually in a rigorous peer-review process. The 
assessment criteria included a range of indicators, 
including the following: minimum number of cases; 
proportion of cases confirmed from cancer tissue 
examination (microscopic verification); proportion of 
cases registered from death certificate only; proportion 
of cases with morphology not otherwise specified 
(ie, cases in the unspecified subgroups of ICCC-3 or 
those coded by unspecified morphology codes such as 
8000, 8800, 9800); proportion of cases with an unlikely 
combination of site and morphology, or an unlikely 
age and tumour type; proportion of rare entities (ie, 
neoplasms that occurred with a frequency of <0·05% in 
large datasets); proportion of dates of birth and incidence 
that were incomplete; proportion of ages that were 
imprecise; overall incidence rates; proportion of cases 
and incidence by sex, age group, and tumour type; 
the stability of rates over time; proportion of multiple 
primary diagnoses; and consistency of population data. 
All questionable records and raised issues were fed back 
to the contributing registries with a request for correction 
or a response. This iterative process resulted in a marked 
improvement of the overall quality of the data included 
in the analyses. The improvements included completion 
of missing information, additional years of data, 
inclusion of information from missed data sources, 
correction of coding errors, improvements in calculation 
of age, inclusion of non-malignant CNS tumours, 
replacement of population data, and explanation of the 
questioned patterns.
Statistical analysis
We calculated age-specific incidence rates (ASR) for 
four 5-year age groups (0–4 years, 5–9 years, 10–14 years, 
and 15–19 years) as the quotient of the number of cases 
and the number of person-years in the respective 
categories of sex, geographical area, and racial or ethnic 
group for the applicable time period, expressed per 
million person-years. We defined person-years as the 
sum of the population counts in a specific geographical 
area surveyed by a registry in each year from 2001 to 
2010, categorised by sex and age and, if relevant, race or 
ethnicity. In the absence of all required details, 
we estimated the covered population counts by 
linear interpolation (six registries) or extrapolation 
(three registries) from the data provided by the 
registries, based on an assumption of regular 
population growth, before calculating rates. The 
purpose of this study was to make comparisons among 
regions and time periods, so all reported incidence rates 
for the 0–14 years and 0–19 years age groups were 
adjusted via direct standardisation. We calculated 
age-standardised rates (WSRs) as the weighted average of 
the three age-specific rates (to calculate rates for 0–14 
years) or four age-specific rates (for 0–19 years), using the 
weights of the world standard population7 (appendix p 5). 
We calculated incidence sex ratios by dividing the 
incidence in male individuals with that in female 
individuals.
The results are presented for 19 geographical regions 
or populations and a combined total; all the defined 
regions are either UN-defined regions8 or an aggregate 
of UN-defined regions, with the exception of North 
America, for which we present data separately for 
Canada and the USA, and have split data for the USA 
into five racial or ethnic groups. Within the region of 
south Asia, eligible data were only available from India. 
The described region definition was also driven by the 
data availability and the sizes of the resulting respective 
regional datasets. We calculated the proportion of the 
covered population of the world and each region by 
dividing the included person-years by the total person-
years in 2001–10 by age group, as estimated by the UN 
in 2015.9 
To compare the incidence rates derived from the 
paediatric dataset for 2001–10 with those published in 
IICC-2,2 we assigned IICC-2 registry data to the same 
geographical regions as used in this IICC-3 study. We 
calculated the WSRs and their 95% CIs for children aged 
0–14 years. Although the target period of IICC-2 was 
the 1980s, the time periods of the contributing registries 
differed both in length and starting years, because they 
either followed on from the IICC-1 period or they could 
not provide other years of data. 
Statistical 
analyses 
were 
done 
using 
Stata/IC 
(version 12.1).
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. MC, AD, and ES-F had full access to all the 
raw data used in the study. The corresponding author 
had final responsibility for the decision to submit for 
publication.
Results
Of the 532 invited cancer registries, 420 submitted 
their data and 309 met standard data quality criteria. Of 
those, 153 quality-assured registries from 62 countries, 
departments, and territories contributed data for the 
entire decade (appendix pp 3–4). Of the 153 included 
registries, 72 were initially unacceptable, but improved 
through the iterative quality assurance procedure. 
Approximately 11·4% of the world population aged 
0–14 years (contributing 18 376 710 144 person-years) was 
covered by the registries included in our study, ranging 
from 1·7% in south Asia (India) to 99·4% in North 
America (table 1). The coverage was slightly less, at 
8·9%, for young people aged 15–19 years (contributing

6 105 345 342 person-years), with the lowest being 0·8% 
in sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, 385 509 registered cases 
occurring in 2·64 billion person-years contributed to the 
analyses (tables 1, 2). Registration of non-malignant 
CNS tumours differed by registry, and was higher in the 
paediatric dataset than in the general dataset (table 1, 2). 
The overall WSRs were 140·6 per million person-years 
in children aged 0–14 years and 155·8 per million 
person-years in those aged 0–19 years (table 2). The ASR 
in young people aged 15–19 years was 185·3 per million 
person-years.
Incidence rates were slightly higher in boys than in 
girls (incidence sex ratio was 1·17 in the 0–14 years age 
group and 1·14 in the 0–19 years age-group) and varied 
with age, region, and diagnostic group (table 2; appendix 
p 8). Across all regions, incidence was higher in boys 
than in girls (incidence sex ratio ranged from 1·1 to 1·4 
in the 0–19 years age group; appendix p 8), except for 
the 15–19 years age group of Native Americans in the 
USA (incidence sex ratio of 0·9) and in east Asia (1·0), 
where girls had a higher incidence (ratios rounded to 
one decimal place; appendix p 8). The highest incidence 
sex ratio was observed in the age group of 5–9 years in 
south Asia (India; 1·7; appendix p 8). Sex-specific 
incidence varied by diagnostic group, with renal 
tumours and epithelial tumours more common in girls, 
with variations by age group (appendix p 8). Germ cell 
and gonadal tumours were also more common in girls 
than in boys in the 0–14 years age group (appendix p 8).
ASRs were higher in children aged 0–4 years and 
15–19 years than in those aged 5–9 years and 10–14 years 
(table 2). ASRs also differed between regions, especially 
for the age groups with high ASRs (appendix pp 6, 9). 
In the 0–14 years group, overall WSRs varied from less 
than 100 per million person-years in sub-Saharan Africa, 
for Native American children in the USA, and in south 
Asia (India), to more than 150 per million person-years 
in some subpopulations of North America and Europe, 
and in Oceania (figure 1A; appendix p 6). In young people 
aged 15–19 years, the lowest ASR was observed in

south Asia (India), whereas the highest ASRs were 
seen in some predominantly white populations of North 
America, Europe, and Oceania (figure 1B; appendix p 6).
The range of tumour types varied markedly with age 
group (figure 2). In children aged 0–4 years, leukaemia 
represented 36·1% (45 849 of 127 096) of all cases; however, 
the proportion of leukaemia cases was 15·4% (15 520 of 
100 860) in young people aged 15–19 years. Conversely, 
lymphomas represented 5·3% (6766 of 127 096) of cases in 
children aged 0–4 years, and 22·5% (22 740 of 100 860) of 
cases in those aged 15–19 years. CNS tumours were the 
second most frequent tumour type after leukaemia in 
children aged 0–4 years (21 804 [17·2%] of 127 096), 
5–9 years (19 471 [26·3%] of 74 175), and 10–14 years 
(16 680 [20·0%] of 83 378; figure 2). Epithelial tumours 
and melanoma represented 0·9% of all cases in children 
aged 0–4 years (1197 of 127 096), but were the second most 
common tumour group in young people aged 15–19 years 
(21 480 [21·3%] of 100 860). 
The most common sympathetic nervous system 
tumour across all age groups was neuroblastoma. It was 
most frequent in children aged 0–4 years (15 888 [12·5%] 
of 127 096) and very rare in those aged 15–19 years 
(218 [0·2%] of 100 860; figure 2). Of note is the relatively 
high sympathetic nervous system tumour WSR of 
10·2 per million person-years in black children in the 
USA, which contrasts with the WSR of 2·7 per million 
person-years in the mostly black population of Sub-
Saharan Africa (table 3). Renal tumours were common in 
children aged 0–4 years (11 297 [8·9%] of 127 096), and 
their relative frequency decreased in older age groups, 
to 0·7% (756 of 100 860) in young people aged 15–19 years 
(figure 2). Bone tumours constituted 4·7% (13 320

of 284 649) of all cancers in children aged 0–14 years, 
and 7·8% (7851 of 100 860) in those aged 15–19 years 
(figure 2; appendix p 10). Soft tissue sarcomas were 
present in a similar proportion of cases in children aged 
0–14 years and those aged 15–19 years in most regions 
(table 3, 4; figure 2; appendix p 10). In sub-Saharan 
Africa, 46% (579 of 1262) of all soft tissue sarcomas in 
children aged 0–14 years were Kaposi’s sarcoma 
compared with 57% (119 of 208) in those aged 0–19 years, 
whereas in all the other regions Kaposi’s sarcoma 
represented less than 1% of all soft tissue sarcomas in 
children younger than 15 years and a maximum of 2% 
(14 of 592) in black children in the USA (data for all 
regions not shown). Germ cell and gonadal tumours 
were rare in children younger than 15 years (10 200 [3·6%] 
of 284 649; table 3), and more common in those aged 
15–19 years (12 105 [12·0%] of 100 860; table 4). The group 
of epithelial neoplasms and melanoma comprises several 
specific types of carcinomas (adrenocortical, thyroid, 
nasopharyngeal, skin), all other types of carcinoma 
(except those occurring in kidney, liver, and gonads), 
and 
melanoma. 
This 
group 
constituted 
3·8% 
(10 679 of 284 649) of all tumours in children aged 
0–14 years and 21·3% (21 480 of 100 860) in those aged 
15–19 years (appendix p 10). The group of other and 
unspecified tumours comprised 0·9% (2469 of 284 649) 
of all cases in children aged 0–14 years and 1·5% (1500 of 
100 860) of all cases in those aged 15–19 years. 
In 22 registries no tumours were classified in this 
category; other and unspecified tumours comprised 5% 
or more of all tumours in ten registries, including one 
registry for which 12% (68 of 561) of all tumours were 
classified as other and unspecified.
In children aged 0–14 years, the leading cancers in all 
regions combined were leukaemia, followed by CNS 
tumours, and then lymphomas, and this ranking was

observed in most world regions (table 3). The exception 
to this pattern was seen in the two African regions 
(appendix p 10). Incidence rates of all tumour types 
varied considerably between the regions (figure 3). The 
ratios of highest to lowest regional WSR were higher 
than 5·0 for CNS tumours (6·2), germ cell and gonadal 
tumours (5·9), neuroblastoma (5·6), epithelial tumours 
and melanoma (5·5), and leukaemia (5·2).
In young people aged 15–19 years, lymphomas were the 
most common cancers in all regions combined, followed 
by epithelial tumours and melanoma (table 4; figure 4). 
However, leukaemia was the most common neoplasm in 
this age group in South America, Native American and 
white Hispanic children in the USA, south Asia (India), 
and southeast Asia (table 4; figure 4). In Oceania, white 
non-Hispanic children in the USA, in east Asia, and in 
Central America and the Caribbean the most common 
cancer type was the group of epithelial cancers and 
melanoma (table 4; figure 4). Geographical variations in 
incidence, expressed as the ratio of the highest to the 
lowest ASR across regions, were 5·0 or higher for 
hepatic tumours (7·8), germ cell tumours (6·4), CNS 
tumours (6·0), lymphomas (5·4), epithelial tumours and 
melanoma (5·2), and soft tissue sarcomas (5·0).
From the 1980s to 2001–10, the overall WSR for all 
tumours in children aged 0–14 years increased from 
124·0 per million person-years (95% CI 123·3–124·7) in 
the 1980s to 140·6 per million person-years (140·1–141·1) 
in 2001–10. The increase was seen in all regions except 
sub-Saharan Africa, and was smallest in Central America 
and the Caribbean (WSR 125·3 [95% CI 121·2–129·4] in 
1980–89; 129·2 [95% CI 125·9–132·5] in 2001–10) and 
highest in southeast Asia (92·0 [95% CI 89·2–94·8]; 
119·8 [95% CI 117·3–122·3]). In sub-Saharan Africa, a 
decrease was noted between the 1980s (81·0 [95% CI 
76·8–85·2]) and 2001–10 (56·3 [95% CI 55·1–57·5]; 
figure 5; appendix p 7).
Discussion
Using data provided by 153 high-quality cancer registries, 
we report internationally comparable incidence rates of 
cancer in children aged 0–19 years during 2001–10. The 
incidence of cancer in children aged 0–14 years was 
140·6 per million person-years, and in those aged 
0–19 years was 155·8 per million person-years. We report 
considerable variations in incidence by diagnostic group,6 
sex, age group, and world region. We have also shown 
that the overall WSR in children aged 0–14 years has 
increased between the preceding comparable publication 
covering the 1980s,10 and 2001–10. To our knowledge, this 
report presents the best available information on cancer 
incidence for the given period and age group.
We chose WSR as a relative estimate of cancer burden, 
but it should not be used for estimating numbers of cases 
in a population, because the value of WSR depends on 
the choice of the standard population. The world standard 
population7 has been used in previous international 
publications;1,2 choosing the same standard thus ensures 
comparability between populations and periods. 
Although 20% of the cancers occurring in young people 
aged 15–19 years were epithelial tumours (the most 
prevalent histology types in adults) or melanoma, this age 
group also had high proportions of lymphomas, 
leukaemias, germ cell tumours, and sarcomas. Therefore, 
ICCC-36 seems to be well adapted to reporting incidence in 
this age group, because the named tumour groups 
represent the main diagnostic categories in ICCC-3. We 
found that the incidence of cancer in young people aged 
15–19 years was 185·3 per million person-years, based on 
100 860 cases.
Because not all the contributing paediatric cancer 
registries could provide data for young people aged 
15–19 years, the analyses for children aged 0–14 years were 
based on a different dataset (paediatric dataset) than were 
the analyses for children aged 0–19 years or those aged 
15–19 years (general dataset). The two resulting datasets

gave different estimates of incidence for the (common) 
age group of 0–14 years, and this incidence was 5% lower 
in the paediatric than in the general dataset. This 
difference can be explained by variations in population 
coverage between the registries, and possibly distinctive 
data sources used by the two types of registries (ie, those 
that included data for young people aged 15–19 years and 
those that did not), as was shown previously in an analysis 
of data on childhood cancer in Europe.4 Although the 
results presented from both datasets are based on the best 
data available for each age group, they also emphasise the 
importance of quality assurance, particularly when 
dealing with a rare disease such as childhood cancer.
We selected the contributing registries because they 
provided quality-assured data for the entire decade of 
2001–10. Inevitably, the reported rates were influenced by 
this selection; however, they provide the best and unique 
comparable global incidence estimates for the given 
period because they are not affected by intermittent 
contributions for parts of the target period.
A particular strength of our study comes from separate 
presentation of the incidence patterns for the five racial 
and ethnic groups distinguished in the US data, despite 
the difficulties in classifying the US population into 
racial and ethnic groups due to population mixing, 
migration, and self-declaration of ethnicity.11 Unfor-
tunately, the ethnic differences within multi-ethnic 
populations of Europe, Canada, and some other regions 
could not be readily studied. In other countries 
(South Africa, Israel, Australia) it was possible to gather 
incidence data for specific ethnicities within the 
population. For the purpose of simplicity these data were 
not included in this paper; however, they are available 
online on the IICC-3 website.
Our study improved the overall data quality in all 
participating cancer registries, particularly in 72 of 153 
whose datasets were not acceptable at the beginning of 
the study. The study raised the registries’ awareness of 
additional data sources (haematology, opthalmology, 
orthopaedics, dermatologicaly, neurology, endocrinology, 
and paediatric clinics) and of specific quality control. We 
required a high level of quality and completeness for our 
study, because small errors or omissions would have had 
a large impact on the resulting incidence rates.
Approximately 30 cancer registries dropped out of the 
study, irrespective of the quality of their data. Such loss is 
especially regrettable in LMICs, where data are sparse 
and health policy has to be based on information from 
other countries. Data collected on more than 40 million 
person-years in 12 cancer registries (Canada [New 
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island], Denmark, Finland, 
Germany [Berlin, Brandenburg, Bremen, Mecklenburg-
Vorpommern, Sachsen-Anhalt, and the Free States 
Saxony and Thuringia], and Singapore) could not be used 
because these registries were bound by requirements of 
a specific administrative procedure to approve provision 
of their data.
Although the cancer registries follow international 
guidelines, we observed wide variation in registration 
techniques, access to data sources, case eligibility criteria, 
application and interpretation of registration standards, 
and coding systems. Non-malignant tumours repre 
sented 
0–10% of the total cases and affected international 
comparability. Non-malignant tumours were eligible for 
registration more commonly in Europe than in other 
parts of the world. Other practices reduced data quality 
(eg, restricted or no access to pathology reports), 
completeness (eg, restricted or no access to identifiable 
death certificates), or timeliness (eg, third-party data 
encryption). In some registries cases were coded as

microscopically verified only if the pathology report could 
be reviewed by registry staff. In others, precise morphology 
codes were not available for a large proportion of 
microscopically verified diagnoses. Registries are often 
under-resourced, and large investments for a small 
proportion of cases in general cancer registries might not 
be seen as a priority; however, these variations highlight 
the need for support to enable production of high-quality 
and comparable data.
A high proportion of specified diagnoses cannot be 
ensured without available specialised diagnostic facilities. 
The category of unspecified morphology might have 
included misclassified specific cancers, but in the 
absence of precise documentation it might have also 
included cases that were not malignant or cancers that 
did not occur in children.
Although the differences in sex ratios by diagnostic 
group and age might have to a large extent reflected true 
differences in disease occurrence,12 the differences by 
geographical region could have more readily reflected 
sociocultural customs whereby boys are favoured over 
girls to seek medical attention when sick. The potential 
for such selective treatment in India and in some African 
populations was supported by our registry contacts in 
those regions when we inquired about a possibility of 
inequality in seeking health care.
The registries with no access to a national database of 
all causes of death might not have registered the cancers 
that were only discovered at the time of death, even 
though the proportion of missed cases might be low in 
childhood populations. In some countries death 
certification is non-existent whereas in others access to 
these records is hindered by data protection laws. 
Factors external to the registry operations should also 
be considered. Higher socioeconomic level of develop-
ment, better treatment facilities, and unobstructed access 
to data sources are linked to more advanced registration 
systems and better data quality. The registries operating 
in some LMICs were particularly affected by missing or 
infrequent official population estimates, and these data 
needed to be estimated by interpolation or extrapolation, 
influencing the reported rates. The low incidence rates 
observed in low-resource regions might in part have 
resulted from underdiagnosis,13 but our analysis could 
not quantify its extent. Treatment abandonment, 
common in LMICs,14 might also have led to under-
registration if identified patients who refused treatment 
were not sufficiently well described (eg, missing dates or 
place of residence). Under-ascertainment of diagnosed 
cases 
might 
have 
resulted 
from 
administrative 
restrictions of access to medical files, political or social 
instability, competing needs, and inadequate political 
will, causing a dearth of resources, shortage or volatility 
of registry personnel, loss of perennial expertise, and 
missing or broken links with relevant data sources. 
Overestimates of incidence might have occurred in 
areas with superior treatment facilities if the place of 
permanent residence could not be correctly determined 
for registered patients, and national coverage would 
neutralise such artefactual regional differences within a 
country.15 Accurate incidence rates are also difficult to 
obtain in ethnic minorities, such as the Native American 
population in the USA, possibly because of imprecise 
classification of the at-risk population, as well as patients 
with cancer.16 Cancer statistics in high-income countries 
might be influenced by overdiagnosis of some cancers 
detected by non-invasive imaging and screening tests, 
including neuroblastoma, thyroid cancer, melanoma, 
and kidney cancer.17
Although a complete assessment of time trends in 
incidence falls outside the scope of this report, our data 
showed that the overall incidence of registered neoplasms 
in childhood increased between the 1980s and the 2000s. 
Our comparison is certainly influenced by the 
composition of the two data pools (different registries 
have contributed to the two compared periods); however, 
the increase in the overall rates is clear. The reasons 
might include improved diagnosis (eg, imaging of brain 
tumours in high-income countries and less under-
diagnosis in some parts of world). Cancer registration 
is also developing constantly, and more effective 
ascertainment techniques might have been used since 
the 1980s. Future detailed analyses of time trends by 
tumour group and subpopulations will bring more clarity 
to the interpretation of these secular changes.
The reduction of cancer incidence in sub-Saharan 
Africa probably had two main causes. First, this IICC-3 
study included data from the national childhood cancer 
registry of South Africa, which contributed 70% of all 
cases for this region and reported very low incidence 
rates. Of the five datasets classified as sub-Saharan 
African in IICC-2, only one (from Namibia) reported a 
lower overall incidence rate than the South African 
registry in IICC-3. The possible reasons for the low rates 
in South Africa are discussed elsewhere.18 Second, the 
implementation of antiretroviral therapy in some areas 
affected by HIV19 has contributed to a decrease in 
incidence of Kaposi’s sarcoma. This cancer type 
represented more than a third of the total cancer 
incidence in Kampala, Uganda, in the IICC-2 (WSR 182·7 
per million person-years). The incidence of Kaposi’s 
sarcoma in Kampala halved between the IICC-2 and this 
IICC-3 study, and a decreasing trend between the 1990s 
and the 2000s was also noted in a Kampala registry 
study.20
Leukaemia, the most common cancer in children 
worldwide, had the largest impact on total cancer 
incidence. The strikingly low incidence of leukaemia in 
the African regions, notably in sub-Saharan Africa, might 
give some clues as to the cause of this cancer. Even 
though strong underdiagnosis of leukaemia is suspected 
in sub-Saharan Africa,21 leukaemia was also less 
commonly diagnosed in black children in the USA than 
in the other US ethnic groups; however, whether 
 Articles

www.thelancet.com/oncology   Vol 18   June 2017
leukaemia might be underdiagnosed as a result of 
reduced access to health care associated with lower 
economic status in this group is unclear.22 In children 
aged 0–14 years, the highest leukaemia rates were in 
Hispanic white children in the USA (40% of total 
incidence). The Native American component of Hispanic 
ancestry was a presumed risk factor, based on the 
observations that known risk alleles at loci identified in 
genome-wide association studies of European-ancestry 
populations in CDKN2A, PIP4K2A, CEBPE, and ARID5B 
were all significantly associated with Native American 
ancestry.23 Comparatively high incidence rates and the 
largest proportion of leukaemia among all cancers were 
reported in southeast Asia. A link to the massive use of 
pesticides in this world region24 to protect crops and 
increase yields should be examined in specific studies, 
since exposure to pesticides has been associated with 
leukaemia risk.25,26
The male predominance among patients with 
lymphoma is probably a result of innate sex differences 
in susceptibility, but with increasing age other factors 
might play a role, such as the increased risk of HIV 
infection in boys compared with girls.27 The highest 
incidence of lymphomas worldwide has been reported in 
the Mediterranean region (as shown in our study and 
others28), and in HIV-infected populations,29 with B-cell 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma an AIDS-defining malignancy.
Burkitt’s lymphoma is endemic and common in some 
sub-Saharan African childhood populations,30 in which 
HIV infection can further accentuate its incidence.2,31 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma is rarer in populations of south 
and east Asia than in other parts of the world; the 
undergoing socioeconomic changes might gradually 
result in a similarly high incidence to that observed in 
Western populations.32,33
The highest incidence of all CNS tumours was noted in 
high-income countries, which is clearly related to the 
wide availability of diagnostic facilities. The lower 
incidence 
rates 
in 
LMICs 
most 
probably 
(and 
proportionately) reflect poor access to neuroimaging 
facilities (eg, low number of CT or MRI scans, long 
waiting lists, and prohibitive costs of diagnostics tests).34,35 
This poor access causes delay in diagnosis and possibly 
underdiagnosis of brain tumours.36 Comparability of 
incidence of CNS tumours across the continents would 
be greatly improved if all registries attempted to collect 
information on non-malignant CNS tumours, at least in 
children.
This study describes the global cancer incidence 
patterns in children younger than 20 years for 2001–10, 
providing an update to comparable information that is 
now almost 20 years old.2 Despite possible artefacts 
influencing data availability, quality, and comparability, 
the size of the studied populations and the observed 
differences in our study suggest that our data are 
sufficiently robust for international comparisons of 
childhood cancer occurrence, and provide useful pointers 
for further studies. The collected data can be used for 
further research, including continued development of 
childhood-specific registration standards and guidelines, 
detailed studies in subpopulations and by tumour 
subtype, and global estimates of cancer indicators. This 
report constitutes a springboard for attaining several 
targets of the Sustainable Development Goal aiming at 
ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing of all at 
all ages. High-quality data over time is vital to devising 
cancer control mechanisms in childhood populations 
worldwide. Local data that are internationally comparable 
are therefore indispensable for aetiological research and 
for effective health policy actions. Sharing of data 
internationally should not impose an unaffordable 
burden on data acquisition and validation in coordinated 
studies. To secure data availability and quality, constant 
support of cancer registration is required at local, 
national, and international levels.
