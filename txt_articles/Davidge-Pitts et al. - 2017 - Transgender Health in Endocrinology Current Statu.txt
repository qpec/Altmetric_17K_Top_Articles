Context: The transgender population continues to face challenges in accessing appropriate health
care. Adequate training of endocrinologists in this area is a priority.
Objectives: Assess the status of transgender health care education in US endocrinology fellowship
training programs and assess knowledge and practice of transgender health among practicing US
endocrinologists.
Design: Mayo Clinic and the Endocrine Society developed and administered a Web-based
anonymous survey to 104 endocrinology fellowship program directors (PDs; members of the
Association of Program Directors in Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism) and 6992 US
medical doctor members of Endocrine Society.
Results: There were 54 total responses from 104 PDs (51.9%). Thirty-five of these 54 programs
(72.2%) provide teaching on transgender health topics; however, 93.8% respondents indicated that
fellowship training in this area is important. Barriers to provision of education included lack of
faculty interest or experience. The most desired strategies to increase transgender-specific content
included online training modules for trainees and faculty. Of 411 practicing clinician responders,
almost 80% have treated a transgender patient, but 80.6% have never received training on care of
transgender patients. Clinicians were very or somewhat confident in terms of definitions (77.1%),
taking a history (63.3%), and prescribing hormones (64.8%); however, low confidence was reported
outside of the hormonal realm. The most requested methods of education included online training
modules and presentation of transgender topics at meetings.
Conclusions: Confidence and competence in transgender health needs to increase among endo-
crinologists. Strategies include the development of online training modules, expansion of formal
transgender curricula in fellowship programs, and presentations at national and international
meetings. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 102: 1286–1290, 2017)
T
he social awareness and acceptance of transgender
individuals has increased dramatically in the past
decade. Despite this, the health care profession continues
to face challenges in providing optimal care for this
population. Lambda Legal reports 70% of transgender
individuals have suffered some form of maltreatment at
the hands of medical providers, including harassment and
violence (1). Suicide attempts among transgender in-
dividuals are also extraordinarily high, up to 60% in
those who reported a health care provider has refused to
treat them (2). Barriers to adequate care of this pop-
ulation include little or no formal training in addressing

 the needs of these patients (3–5). There is a substantial
paucity of transgender education in medical school and
residency programs. In 2015, White et al. published a
study looking at US and Canadian medical students’
preparedness and comfort with lesbian, gay, bisexual,
and transgender care. The majority (67.3%) evaluated
their lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender curriculum
as “fair” or worse, and felt there was room for im-
provement (6). Data provided by 6 Canadian medical
schools revealed that large differences exist in content,
curricular structure, and time spent on transgender
health and that although almost all student responders
agreed that transgender issues are important and should
be addressed by physicians, fewer than 10% perceived
that they possessed adequate knowledge to provide such
care (7).
The importance that residents place on transgender
surgical training appears to vary according to gender,
geographical location, and prior exposure to transgender
patient care through direct patient interaction (8). Confi-
dence or comfort level in providing care to transgender
patients has been reported to be low among practicing
gynecologists, general pediatricians, and pediatric endo-
crinologists (9, 10). Only one survey has been published on
comfort in transgender health care in endocrinology. An
anonymous survey was administered to 80 conference
attendees that included endocrinologists, trainees, and
nurse practitioners/physician assistants (3); of these, 63%
were willing to provide care for transgender individuals,
but only 41% described themselves as “very” or “some-
what” competent to provide transgender care.
To date, there has not been an evaluation of the current
education status of our endocrinology fellows in trans-
gender care or the status of knowledge and practice in
transgender care of practicing clinicians with an interest
in endocrinology.
Materials and Methods
Mayo Clinic and the Endocrine Society developed a Web-based
anonymous survey that was sent to 104 endocrinology fel-
lowship program directors (PDs) and 6992 US medical doctors
(MDs) and MD/PhD members of Endocrine Society, the ma-
jority of whom were adult endocrinologists, with approxi-
mately 8% specializing in pediatric endocrinology. The survey
content, designed by an interprofessional team of experts in
transgender care and postgraduate medical education, was
informed by discussion and review of the literature. The survey
was considered exempt by Mayo Clinic’s Intuitional Review
Board. The survey comprised two parts: the first 12 questions
were directed to PDs only (members of the Association of
Program Directors in Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metab-
olism), and aimed to assess the current status of transgender
health care education in US endocrinology fellowship training
programs. The remaining 18 questions were answered by US
clinicians in practice with a current membership of the
Endocrine Society. This portion of the survey was designed to
address knowledge and practice of transgender health among
practicing clinicians with an interest in endocrinology. The
survey was distributed to a diverse group with respect to geo-
graphical location and institution type. The questions were
designed using a 5-point Likert scale, and each question was
analyzed independently. The survey was distributed elec-
tronically via e-mail from the Endocrine Society, with two
additional reminder e-mails approximately 2 weeks apart.
No incentives were provided.
Results
Table 1 displays general characteristics of responders.
PDs
At the time of the survey, 104 PDs were members of the
Association of Program Directors in Endocrinology,
Diabetes and Metabolism. There were 54 responses from
104 programs (51.9%). Thirty-five of 54 programs
(72.2%) provided dedicated teaching on transgender
health topics. From a geographical standpoint, 37% of
these programs were in the northeast, 32% in the
southeast, 20% in the midwest, 11% in the southwest,
and 0% in the northwest. Forty-five of 48 (93.8%)
programs indicated that fellowship training in trans-
gender endocrinology is important. Current teaching
methods, hours of education, faculty development, and
clinical years of fellowship are described in Table 2.
Endocrine faculty provided most of the education (35 of
36 responders, 97.2%). Of 35 PDs who responded on
program content, all provided education on principles of
hormone therapy in transgender patients; however, only 22
programs (62.8%) provided content on comprehensive
transgender-orientated sexual and social history taking and
14 programs (40%) provided content on systemic physical
examination. Thirteen programs (37.1%) provided training
on psychosocial and legal issues, 15 programs (42.9%) on
organ-specific screening guidelines, and only 10 (28.6%) on
necessary requirements for gender confirmation surgery.

 Perceived barriers to provision of education for 42 re-
sponders included lack of faculty interest or experience
(59.5%), lack of training resources (47.6%), and lack of
funding (40.5%). The most desired strategies to increase
transgender-specific content from 46 responders included
online training modules for trainees (91.3%) and faculty
(71.7%), lectures from visiting professors (71.7%), and
attendance at meetings with transgender topics (63%).
Practicing clinicians
The survey was sent to 6992 US MD and MD/PhD
members of the Endocrine Society. There were 411 total
responders. Table 3 includes details describing trans-
gender patients treated per year, years of treating
transgender patients, and dedicated training. Of 411
responders, 79.8% have treated a transgender patient in
their career (55% more than five patients per year), but of
382 responders, 80.6% have never received training on
care of a transgender patient. Of those who received
training, 58% reported education during endocrinology
fellowship and 52.7% at local, national, or international
meetings. Very little education occurred during medical
school (4%) and internal medicine residency (6.7%).
Eighteen percent received training online, 30% attending
lectures, 26% through continuing medical education
activities, and 20% indicated “other,” which included
self-directed learning, experience in transgender clinics,
and participation in committees or development of
guidelines. Clinicians were very or somewhat confident in
terms of definitions (77.1%), taking a history (63.3%),
and prescribing hormones (64.8%) to transgender
patients, but reported low confidence in concepts of
gender confirmation surgery (30.8%), organ-specific
screening guidelines (42.4%), and psychosocial/legal is-
sues (35.5%). The most requested methods of education
included online training modules and presentation of
transgender topics at meetings (44.4% and 40.8% of 365
responders, respectively). Of 299 responders, 80.3% of
reported that their practices did not have intake forms to
declare gender nonconformity. Of 351 responders, 40.1%
did not have gender-neutral bathrooms, and of 379 re-
sponders, only 40.6% of staff interacting with patients had
received cultural competency training.
Discussion
The transgender community has a disproportionate
number of individuals who are uninsured, and 19% have
been frankly denied care by health care providers (11).
However, with insurance coverage expansion, care is
becoming more accessible and affordable. With this in-
crease in accessibility, it is anticipated that many patients
will be seeking care under endocrinologists.
We report on the current status of transgender health
care education in US endocrinology fellowship programs.
Although almost three-quarters of endocrinology fel-
lowship programs that responded reported providing
some transgender-related education, there is still a gap
between provided education and perceived importance of

 such education among PDs. Our survey results suggest
that nonhormonal aspects of transgender care are
underemphasized in fellowship program curricula. To
educate caregivers on providing comprehensive, patient-
centered care to transgender persons, curricular content
should be broadened and include education regarding
other transgender-related health care issues. Because
barriers to providing transgender education were iden-
tified predominately to be related to a lack of faculty
expertise/development and of training resources, devel-
opment of online training modules may help address this
issue. Although topics in transgender health care have
become more prominent at national and international
meetings, inclusion of a transgender education program
specifically targeted to trainees could also help bridge the
education gap and provide a cadre of informed caregivers
for the future.
Improvement of transgender education in endocri-
nology fellowship programs should be a priority. We
envision a more structured approach to endocrinology
fellowship training, with an introductory curriculum in
the first year of fellowship aligned to specific compe-
tencies, followed by a more advanced curriculum in the
second or third year. Currently, the Accreditation
Council for Graduate Medical Education does not
require endocrinology training programs to include
transgender-specific content in its curricula. Inclusion
of such criteria in the Accreditation Council for
Graduate Medical Education–specific program re-
quirements would be an important step to optimizing
content of endocrinology fellowship programs.
We also report on the status of knowledge and practice
of transgender health among practicing US clinicians with
an interest in endocrinology. A substantial number of
survey responders in academic and private practice set-
tings who are treating transgender patients have not
received formal training in transgender endocrinology.
Our study indicates that physicians in practice have lower
confidence in the nonhormonal aspects of transgender
care, which is not surprising considering the un-
derrepresentation of such topics in medical school, res-
idency, and endocrinology training programs. In the
practice setting, most responders reported that new
practice intake forms were not gender-sensitive, and just
over one-third reported that allied health staff had re-
ceived training in communication skills important to
transgender care. Because most endocrinologists have
seen a transgender patient at some point in their careers,
but do not have access to a specific transgender clinic
referral, it is important to ensure that the practice envi-
ronment is sensitive to the needs of transgender patients.
Small additions or changes such as availability of gender-
neutral bathrooms can strongly affect a transgender
patient’s comfort and trust in a medical provider. In
addition, providing cultural competency training to all
medical and paramedical staff that interacts face to face,
via phone, or online with transgender patients may in-
crease patient satisfaction (10, 12).
Although this study focused on transgender training in
endocrinology fellowship programs, we think it is also
important to increase transgender content in medical
school and residency programs. Currently in the United
States, transgender medical care is provided by primary
care physicians, various medical and surgical specialists,
and endocrinologists, often in settings that do not include
mental health and surgical services, underscoring the
benefits of including education early in medical training.
Simple interventions such as addition of transgender
content to a medical school curriculum may increase
students’ comfort and willingness to provide health care
to transgender patients (13) and increase knowledge
regarding gender identity and appropriateness of cross-
sex hormone therapy as a treatment of transgender pa-
tients (14). Tulane University instituted four educational
sessions to preclinical medical students that included
didactic lectures (including introduction to transgender
health and hormone therapy for transgender patients)
and a standardized patient encounter. Following this
intervention, the majority of students agreed that they
received new information that would be applicable to a
working physician (15). Intervention at the residency
level has also shown promise with didactics on gender
identity and hormone treatment, resulting in increased
perceived knowledge to assist with hormonal therapy for
female-to-male and male-to-female patients (16). Edu-
cation directed at providers has also been shown to raise
confidence, as seen when the Veterans Administration
launched a program of training and case-based tele-
consultation for 33 Veterans Administration providers at
five clinical sites across the United States (17). In this
program, confidence to treat transgender veterans in-
creased from 59% to 83%. Interventions to reach cli-
nicians in both private practice and academic institutions
can be a challenge; however, online modules aimed at
both providers and practice staff (such as those developed
by Association of American Medical Colleges (18) could
help bridge this gap.
Strengths of this survey include a wide reach around
the United States, with responders from all geographic
regions and both academic and private practice settings.
This survey looks in-depth at all aspects of transgender-
related care from both a training and practice standpoint.
Limitations include the poor response rate from practicing
clinicians, which may reflect e-mail burden as well as low
confidence and/or disinterest in transgender endocrinology.
This may lead to selection bias, as those who were more

 likely to respond may have more experience or interest in
this field. Future areas of research could include a more in-
depth evaluation of pediatric and international trainees and
clinicians.
Conclusions
Improved competence and confidence in delivery of
transgender health needs to increase, not only in pro-
vision of patient care, but also in establishment of practice
environments. We propose that provider education on
transgender health care topics should start sooner—at the
medical school or residency level. Although current endo-
crinology fellowship program content strongly emphasizes
hormone replacement, more multidisciplinary training on
transgender health issues is needed at this level of training.
Considering faculty expertise is limited in most programs,
strategies are needed to educate the current cohort of
undertrained endocrinologists and fellows and to ensure
competency in transgender health care for future endocri-
nologists. These include developing online training mod-
ules, core curricula and expansion of clinical exposure in
training programs, and expanded inclusion of transgender-
related topics at national and international meetings.
Online education modules could also reach clinicians
with little academic exposure outside of their clinical
practice. Targets for improved transgender care should
also include cultural competency training for all staff
interacting with transgender patients.
