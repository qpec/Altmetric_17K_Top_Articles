Abstract
Rationale: Hypoxemia is common during endotracheal intubation
of critically ill patients and may predispose to cardiac arrest and
death. Administration of supplemental oxygen during laryngoscopy
(apneic oxygenation) may prevent hypoxemia.
Objectives: To determine if apneic oxygenation increases the lowest
arterial oxygen saturation experienced by patients undergoing
endotracheal intubation in the intensive care unit.
Methods: This was a randomized, open-label, pragmatic trial in
which 150 adults undergoing endotracheal intubation in a medical
intensive care unit were randomized to receive 15 L/min of 100%
oxygen via high-flow nasal cannula during laryngoscopy (apneic
oxygenation) or no supplemental oxygen during laryngoscopy (usual
care). The primary outcome was lowest arterial oxygen saturation
between induction and 2 minutes after completion of endotracheal
intubation.
Measurements and Main Results: Median lowest arterial oxygen
saturation was 92% with apneic oxygenation versus 90% with usual
care (95% confidence interval for the difference, 21.6 to 7.4%;
P = 0.16). There was no difference between apneic oxygenation and
usualcareinincidenceofoxygensaturationlessthan90%(44.7vs.47.2%;
P = 0.87), oxygen saturation less than 80% (15.8 vs. 25.0%; P = 0.22),
or decrease in oxygen saturation greater than 3% (53.9 vs. 55.6%;
P = 0.87).Durationofmechanicalventilation,intensivecareunitlength
of stay, and in-hospital mortality were similar between study groups.
Conclusions: Apneic oxygenation does not seem to increase lowest
arterial oxygen saturation during endotracheal intubation of critically ill
patients compared with usual care. These findings do not support routine
use of apneic oxygenation during endotracheal intubation of critically ill
adults.

Hypoxemia is the most common
complication of endotracheal intubation in
the critically ill (1–4) and the strongest risk
factor for periprocedural cardiac arrest and
death (5). The traditional approach to
avoiding desaturation during intubation is
preoxygenation (6–10). However, in
critically ill patients, acute physiologic
abnormalities render preoxygenation less
effective (7) and often insufficient to
prevent desaturation during even short
periods of apnea (11).

Semler, Janz, Lentz, et al.: Apneic Oxygenation for Emergent Intubation
273
 Apneic oxygenation is the delivery
of supplemental oxygen to the
nasopharynx in the absence of ventilation
(12). Even without lung expansion,
alveolar oxygen diffuses into the
bloodstream and is consumed into
carbon dioxide. Because of the high
affinity of carbon dioxide for hemoglobin
and effective buffering, the volume of
carbon dioxide returned to the alveoli
is less than the volume of oxygen
removed. As a result, alveolar pressure
decreases and gas is drawn down from
the nasopharynx (10). By increasing the
fraction of oxygen in the gas moving from
the nasopharynx to the lungs, apneic
oxygenation aims to prevent arterial
desaturation.
Apneic oxygenation has been used
to prevent desaturation in patients
undergoing brain death examination (13),
bronchoscopy (14), endoscopy (15),
and even elective endotracheal intubation
for general anesthesia (16–19). Although
administration of oxygen by nasal
cannula (20) during laryngoscopy has been
adopted in many emergency departments
(21) and intensive care units (ICUs) (22),
there are significant differences between
intubating electively in the operating
room and urgently in out-of-operating
room settings. Despite two recent “before-
after” studies suggesting benefit for apneic
oxygenation in out-of-operating room
intubations (22, 23), the effectiveness of
apneic oxygenation in this context remains
unclear. We conducted a prospective,
randomized trial comparing the
impact of apneic oxygenation with usual
care on lowest arterial oxygen saturation
during endotracheal intubation of critically
ill adults. We hypothesized that the
lowest arterial oxygen saturation during
intubation would be higher with apneic
oxygenation.
Methods
Study Design
The FELLOW (Facilitating EndotracheaL
intubation by Laryngoscopy technique
and apneic Oxygenation Within the
intensive care unit) Study was a randomized,
open-label, parallel-group, pragmatic trial
comparing apneic oxygenation with usual
care during endotracheal intubation of
critically ill adults. The trial was factorialized
to also compare direct with video
laryngoscopy, the details of which will
be reported separately. The study protocol
was approved by the institutional review
board at Vanderbilt University with
waiver of informed consent. The trial
was registered online before initiation
(NCT02051816), and the statistical
analysis plan was made publically
available before completion of enrollment
(https://starbrite.vanderbilt.edu/rocket/
page/FELLOW; available in the online
data supplement).
Study Participants
From February 13, 2014 to February 11,
2015 we enrolled patients undergoing
endotracheal intubation in the medical
ICU at Vanderbilt University Medical
Center. All patients 18 years or older being
intubated by a pulmonary and critical
care medicine fellow were eligible. Patients
were excluded if awake intubation was
planned, if intubation was required so
emergently that randomization could not be
achieved, or if the treating clinicians believed
a specific approach to intraprocedural
oxygenation or a specific laryngoscopy device
was mandated for the safe performance of the
procedure (Figure 1).
Randomization
Eligible patients were randomly assigned in
a 1:1 ratio to receive apneic oxygenation
(intervention) or usual care (control). Per
the factorial design, patients were also
simultaneously randomized to either
video or direct laryngoscopy, details of
which will be reported separately. The
sequence of study group assignments was
generated via a computerized algorithm
using permuted blocks of 4, 8, and 12.
Study group assignments were placed in
sequentially numbered opaque envelopes
that remained sealed until the decision
had been made that a patient required
intubation and was enrolled in the study.
Study Treatments
For all patients, study protocol governed
only provision of supplemental oxygen
during apnea and laryngoscopy device
used on the first laryngoscopy attempt.
Decisions regarding intubation, approach to
preoxygenation, patient positioning,
medications for induction and
neuromuscular blockade, ventilation
between induction and laryngoscopy,
choice of laryngoscope blade type and
size, and use of additional airway
management equipment were made by the
clinical team. Intubation practices in the
study environment are detailed in the
online supplement. Operator compliance
with general best-practices in airway
management was prospectively collected
from a convenience sample of consecutive
intubations.
Although preoxygenation was allowed,
patients in the usual care group were
intubated without supplemental oxygen
during laryngoscopy. For patients in the
apneic oxygenation group, a high-flow
nasal cannula (Comfort Soft Plus;
Westmed, Inc., Tucson, AZ) set to 15 L/min
flow of 100% oxygen was placed in the
patient’s nares before induction and
kept in place until intubation was complete.
Because of the nature of the study
intervention, clinicians and study
personnel were aware of study group
assignments after enrollment.
Data Collection
To minimize observer bias, data
collection during intubation was
performed by independent observers
unaware of the study hypothesis and not
involved in the performance of the
procedure. To confirm the accuracy of
data collected by the independent observers,
the primary investigators concurrently
assessed the same outcomes for a
At a Glance Commentary
Scientific Knowledge on the
Subject: Hypoxemia is the most
common complication of emergent
endotracheal intubation. Provision of
supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula
during laryngoscopy (apneic
oxygenation) has been shown in small
randomized trials to prevent
desaturation during elective intubation
of healthy preoperative patients and
has been recommended during
intubation of the acutely ill, although it
has never been tested in this setting.
What This Study Adds to the
Field: This randomized clinical trial
found no difference between apneic
oxygenation and usual care in the
lowest oxygen saturation experienced
by critically ill adults undergoing
emergent endotracheal intubation.

 convenience sample of around 10% of study
intubations.
Subjective assessments of Cormack-
Lehane grade of view (24), difficulty of
intubation, and airway complications
during the procedure were self-reported by
the operator. All other data on baseline
characteristics, prelaryngoscopy and
postlaryngoscopy management, and
clinical outcomes were collected from the
medical record by study personnel. All
patients were followed until the first of
hospital discharge, death, or 28 days after
enrollment.
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome was the lowest
arterial oxygen saturation measured by
continuous pulse oximetry (SpO2) between
induction and 2 minutes after successful
endotracheal tube placement (“lowest
arterial oxygen saturation”). Secondary
efficacy outcomes included incidence of
hypoxemia (SpO2 ,90%), severe hypoxemia
(SpO2 ,80%), desaturation (decrease in
SpO2 .3%), and change in saturation
from baseline. Secondary safety outcomes
included Cormack-Lehane grade of glottic
view (24), incidence of successful
intubation on the first laryngoscopy
attempt (placement of an endotracheal tube
in the trachea during the first insertion of
the laryngoscope into the oral cavity
without the use of any other devices),
number of laryngoscopy attempts, time
from induction to intubation, need for
additional airway equipment or operators,
and incidence of nonhypoxemia
complications. Tertiary outcomes included
duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU
length of stay, and in-hospital mortality.
Statistical Analysis
Anticipating a SD of 10% in lowest
arterial oxygen saturation (6), enrollment of
150 patients would provide 80% statistical
power (at a two-sided a level of 0.05) to
detect a difference between groups in
mean lowest arterial oxygen saturation of
4.6%, within the 5% minimum difference
considered clinically meaningful in prior
studies (see online supplement) (6, 9, 17,
18, 22).
Analyses were conducted according
to a statistical analysis plan that was
publically available before completion of
enrollment. Continuous variables were
reported as mean 6 SD or median and
interquartile range (IQR); categorical
variables as frequencies and proportions.
Between-group differences were
analyzed with the Mann-Whitney rank
sum test for continuous variables, Fisher
exact test for categorical variables, and
Spearman rank correlation coefficient for
correlation between two continuous
variables. The primary analysis was an
unadjusted, intention-to-treat comparison
of patients randomized to apneic
oxygenation versus usual care with regard
to the primary outcome of lowest arterial
oxygen saturation.
We performed four prespecified
secondary analyses: (1) the effect of the
intervention on secondary and tertiary
outcomes, (2) the effect of the intervention
on the primary outcome in prespecified
patient and procedural subgroups,
(3) “per-protocol” analyses comparing
lowest arterial oxygen saturation between
patients who received apneic oxygenation
with those who did not, and (4) linear
regression for the outcome of lowest arterial
oxygen saturation in which the exposure
variable of randomized group assignment
was accompanied first by just the covariate
of oxygen saturation at induction and
then by potential baseline confounders.
Subgroup analyses were performed
using logistic regression with heterogeneity
of treatment effect determined on the
basis of statistical test for interaction
between treatment assignment and
subgrouping variable. A two-sided P value
less than 0.05 was used to determine
significance. All analyses were performed
using SPSS Statistics v.22 (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY) or R version 3.2.0 (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria).

 150 met no exclusion criteria and
were enrolled (Figure 1). Patients
randomized to receive apneic
oxygenation (n = 77) and usual care
(n = 73) were similar at baseline (Table 1).
There was no difference between the
two arms in the prior airway management
experience of the fellow performing
the intubation (Table 1). There were
no differences in method of
preoxygenation (Table 1), choice of
induction agent or neuromuscular
blocker, ventilation between induction
and laryngoscopy, or laryngoscope type,
except for higher propofol use for
induction in the usual care arm (13.7 vs.
2.5%; P = 0.02) (see Table E1 in the online
supplement). Oxygen saturation at the
time of induction was 99% (IQR,
96–100%) with apneic oxygenation
compared with 98% (IQR, 94–99%) with
usual care (P = 0.03).

 apneic oxygenation arm did not
(Figure 1). There was no difference
between those randomized to
apneic oxygenation and usual care in
the rate of successful intubation on the
first laryngoscopy attempt (67.5 vs.
67.1%; P = 0.96), time from induction
to secured airway (132 vs. 150 s; P = 0.31),
or any other recorded aspect of the
performance of the procedure (Table 2; see
Table E2).
Main Outcomes
There was no significant difference
between apneic oxygenation and usual
care with regard to the primary outcome
of median lowest arterial oxygen
saturation during the procedure: 92% (IQR,
84–99%) versus 90% (IQR, 80–96%),
respectively (P = 0.16) (Figure 2). Apneic
oxygenation did not impact the proportion
of patients who experienced an oxygen
saturation less than 90%, less than 80%, or
a desaturation greater than 3% during the
procedure (Table 2). There were no
differences in duration of mechanical
ventilation, ICU length of stay, or
in-hospital mortality (Table 2).
In multivariable linear regression
adjusting for saturation at induction alone
or with age, body mass index, Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation
II score, shock, prior noninvasive
ventilation, highest fraction of inspired
oxygen in the prior 6 hours, laryngoscope
choice, and operator experience, apneic
oxygenation did not impact the lowest
arterial oxygen saturation during the
procedure (see Table E3).
Secondary Analyses
There was no difference in lowest arterial
oxygen saturation between apneic
oxygenation and usual care in any of
the subgroups examined (Figure 3).
Specifically, apneic oxygenation was not
significantly more effective for patients at
potentially greater risk for hypoxemia
based on higher FIO2 requirement, lower
oxygen saturation at induction, lower
ratio of oxygen saturation to FIO2 (SpO2/FIO2
ratio [25]) in the prior 6 hours, higher body
mass index, more difficult intubation, or
longer duration of laryngoscopy (see
Figure E1). The type of laryngoscopy
device assigned did not modify the effect
of apneic oxygenation on lowest arterial
oxygen saturation (P value for the
interaction = 0.15) (see Figure E2).
One patient in each arm of the study
was missing a value for lowest arterial
oxygen saturation. In sensitivity analyses
imputing both values (by carrying
forward the saturation at induction or by
assigning apneic oxygenation the highest
possible saturation and usual care the
lowest), there remained no difference
between apneic oxygenation and usual care.
In an a priori defined per-protocol
analysis comparing patients who received
apneic oxygenation (n = 80) with those
who did not (n = 68), there was no
difference in lowest arterial oxygen
saturation (92% [IQR, 84–98%] vs. 90%
[IQR, 80–96%], respectively; P = 0.21) or
in any other clinical outcome (see Tables
E4 and E5 and Figure E3).
The values for lowest arterial
oxygen saturation recorded concurrently
by independent observers and
the primary investigators were
strongly correlated (Spearmen R2 = 0.893;
P , 0.001). Operators were frequently
compliant with general best-practices
in airway management including
preoxygenation, equipment preparation,
end-tidal carbon dioxide detector
availability, and presence of a second
operator (see Table E6).
Discussion
This randomized trial comparing
apneic oxygenation with usual care during
endotracheal intubation of critically ill
adults found that apneic oxygenation did
not increase the lowest arterial oxygen
saturation. There were no significant
differences between apneic oxygenation and
usual care in any primary or secondary
outcome, overall or in any subgroup.

277
 Hypoxemia is the most common
complication of endotracheal intubation
(1–3) and the most closely linked to cardiac
arrest and death (5). Preoxygenation is
often insufficient to prevent desaturation
during intubation (3, 11) and the provision
of supplemental oxygen during apnea has
been advocated as a safe and inexpensive
intervention to improve periintubation
oxygenation (10, 26, 27). The use of apneic
oxygenation has been reported in four
small randomized trials in the operating
room (16–19) and two “before-after”
studies of emergent intubation (22, 23).
Trials of apneic oxygenation during
elective anesthesia ranged in size from
12 to 34 patients, all without acute
pulmonary dysfunction (16–19).
Provision of 3–5 L/min of oxygen
nasally significantly prolonged the
duration of apnea without desaturation
(16–19). Outside the operating room,
Miguel-Montanes and coworkers (22)
observed higher oxygen saturation during
intubation after their ICU switched from
apneic oxygenation at 6 L/min to 60 L/min
and Wimalasena and coworkers (23)
reported a 6% decrease in the incidence
of desaturation after their helicopter
emergency medical service adopted
apneic oxygenation at 15 L/min
by nasal cannula.
In contrast to prior studies, our trial
showed no difference between apneic
oxygenation and usual care. There are
several potential explanations for this
discordance. Prior reports of apneic
oxygenation’s use outside the operating
room were “before-after” designs in which
other changes over time may have
confounded the perceived impact of apneic
oxygenation. Self-reported outcomes in
prior studies may have predisposed to
observer bias. In contrast to healthy
patients undergoing elective anesthesia
(16–19) and patients intubated primarily
for traumatic, hemodynamic, or neurologic
conditions (22, 23), most patients in our
study were intubated for respiratory failure.
For patients with pulmonary function so
abnormal that provision of oxygen by
mask or noninvasive ventilation was
insufficient to avert intubation, providing
15 L/min by nasal cannula during
intubation might be expected to be
similarly ineffective. Although our
analyses did not suggest efficacy for
apneic oxygenation in any subgroup,
whether apneic oxygenation could be
effective in patients with normal
pulmonary function being intubated for
other reasons requires further study.
Finally, whether the dose of apneic
oxygenation delivered was adequate
is important. Our use of 15 L/min via
high-flow nasal cannula was based on
expert recommendation (10) and is a
higher flow rate than prior trials in the
operating room (16–19) but lower than
the 60 L/min delivered in a recent
observational study (22). It seems unlikely
that a higher flow rate would improve
results, however, based on the recent
PREOXYFLOW trial (9). Although the
PREOXYFLOW trial focused on
preoxygenation with high-flow nasal
cannula versus face mask, saturation at
induction was the same in both arms and
the high-flow nasal cannula continued
to deliver 60 L/min of oxygen during
laryngoscopy compared with no oxygen
delivery in the control arm. Median lowest
arterial oxygen saturations for those
receiving 60 L/min apneic oxygenation
versus none were identical to our study at
92 and 90%, respectively.
Our study has several strengths. It is
the first randomized trial specifically
comparing apneic oxygenation with usual
care during intubations outside the
operating room and is five times larger than
any prior trial. The primary outcome, lowest
arterial oxygen saturation during
intubation, is of interest to clinicians; has
been used in prior airway management
trials; and is linked to patient-centered
outcomes, such as cardiac arrest and
death. Collection of study endpoints
by an independent observer and
contemporaneous validation of these data
by the primary investigators reduces
potential for observer bias. The limited
exclusion criteria and relatively small
number excluded promote generalizability.
Our study also has limitations. Conduct
in one medical ICU at a single academic
center may limit generalizability. High
compliance with preoxygenation (including
noninvasive ventilation for patients with
hypoxemia), patient positioning, and
equipment preparation best-practices may
have reduced the potential additive
impact of apneic oxygenation (6, 28, 29).
Had we used a standardized intubation
protocol (6) or a highly uniform group of
operators (7), we might have reduced
practice-related variation in lowest arterial
oxygen saturation, making any effect of
apneic oxygenation easier to detect.
Comparing apneic oxygenation with a nasal
cannula delivering ambient air (placebo)
could have allowed blinding, but would
have inaccurately represented usual care,
obscured complications related to
the delivery of the intervention
(e.g., disruption of mask seal for
bag-valve-mask ventilation by the nasal
cannula itself), and created a safety
hazard by providing a false source of
oxygen to teams conducting emergent
intubation. Our study was powered to
detect the 5% difference in lowest
arterial oxygen saturation that has been
considered clinically meaningful in prior
trials (6, 9, 17, 18), but a smaller difference
might have been missed. Exclusion of
patients clinically determined to require
video laryngoscopy may limit applicability
of our results to patients with abnormal
upper airway anatomy at risk for prolonged

 intubation times. Although not observed in
our analyses, benefit in specific subgroups
of patients (e.g., severe hypoxic respiratory
failure, preserved pulmonary function)
cannot be excluded.
The results of our trial suggest that, for
patients being intubated in the medical ICU,
routine use of apneic oxygenation is safe but
ineffective. Safety without efficacy is
insufficient in the high-stakes, time-
sensitive world of emergent endotracheal
intubation and clinicians should focus
their resources on interventions that
prevent complications (e.g., effective
preoxygenation [6]). Future research
should use rigorously designed trials
either to identify populations who do
benefit from apneic oxygenation or shift
focus to other aspects of airway
management with potential to improve
patient outcomes.
In summary, the results of this
clinical trial suggest that apneic
oxygenation during endotracheal
intubation of critically ill adults does not
increase lowest arterial oxygen saturation
compared with usual care. Routine use of
apneic oxygenation during emergent
intubation cannot be recommended. n
