abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Non–cigarette tobacco marketing is less regulated and may 
promote cigarette smoking among adolescents. We quantified receptivity to advertising for 
multiple tobacco products and hypothesized associations with susceptibility to cigarette 
smoking.
METHODS: Wave 1 of the nationally representative PATH (Population Assessment of Tobacco 
and Health) study interviewed 10 751 adolescents who had never used tobacco. A stratified 
random selection of 5 advertisements for each of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, smokeless 
products, and cigars were shown from 959 recent tobacco advertisements. Aided recall was 
classified as low receptivity, and image-liking or favorite ad as higher receptivity. The main 
dependent variable was susceptibility to cigarette smoking.
RESULTS: Among US youth, 41% of 12 to 13 year olds and half of older adolescents were 
receptive to at least 1 tobacco advertisement. Across each age group, receptivity to 
advertising was highest for e-cigarettes (28%–33%) followed by cigarettes (22%–25%), 
smokeless tobacco (15%–21%), and cigars (8%–13%). E-cigarette ads shown on television 
had the highest recall. Among cigarette-susceptible adolescents, receptivity to e-cigarette 
advertising (39.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 37.9%–41.6%) was higher than for 
cigarette advertising (31.7%; 95% CI: 29.9%–33.6%). Receptivity to advertising for each 
tobacco product was associated with increased susceptibility to cigarette smoking, with 
no significant difference across products (similar odds for both cigarette and e-cigarette 
advertising; adjusted odds ratio = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.09–1.37).
CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of US adolescent never tobacco users are receptive to 
tobacco advertising, with television advertising for e-cigarettes having the highest recall. 
Receptivity to advertising for each non–cigarette tobacco product was associated with 
susceptibility to smoke cigarettes.

WhaT’s KnoWn on This subjecT: The consensus that 
cigarette marketing is 1 cause of adolescent smoking is 
the basis for marketing constraints imposed on these 
products in the United States and elsewhere. Little 
is known about the influence of marketing for non–
cigarette tobacco products.
WhaT This sTudy adds: Advertising for non–cigarette 
tobacco products is reaching non–tobacco-using 
US adolescents, especially through television. High 
percentages of non–tobacco-using adolescents 
recognize tobacco ad images, including e-cigarette ads. 
Receptivity to these ads is associated with susceptibility 
to future cigarette smoking.

Cigarette advertising has been 
causally linked with adolescent 
smoking initiation, 
1 prompting 
marketing restrictions to reduce 
smoking among minors.2 However, 
these restrictions are not uniformly 
applied across tobacco products. For 
example, e-cigarettes, introduced 
in the past decade, are currently 
allowed to be advertised on 
television.3 E-cigarette marketing 
budgets increased rapidly, 
4 with 
a growing presence on television 
reaching youth and young adult 
markets.5 The Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention reports6 
that high school students in the 
United States are increasingly using 
e-cigarettes (2015 = 16.0%), whereas 
the decline in cigarette smoking 
may have stalled (2015 = 9.3%). The 
2015 high school use of cigars was 
8.6%, use of hookahs was 7.2%, and 
smokeless tobacco use was 6.0%. 
In a randomized trial, exposure to 
select television advertisements 
(ads) for e-cigarettes increased the 
susceptibility to use e-cigarettes.7 
In 2014, Blu was the dominant 
e-cigarette brand that  
used television advertising.5, 
 
8 Its 
ads often modeled vaping, which 
has many behavioral similarities to 
cigarette smoking. These similarities 
have led to suggestions that these ads 
might promote cigarette smoking as 
well.9, 
 
10
The effect of advertising on 
adolescent smoking has been 
investigated by using the 
communication-persuasion  
matrix, 
11 
– 
13 which states that an 
individual’s receptivity to an ad can 
be ordered hierarchically by items 
that query exposure, cognitive recall, 
and affective response (eg, liking, 
having a favorite ad).14 At the height 
of popular cigarette marketing 
campaigns in the 1990s (Joe Camel, 
Marlboro Miles), more than half of 
California adolescents indicated a 
favorite cigarette advertisement15 
and this higher level of receptivity 
was associated with later cigarette 
smoking.16, 
 
17 Lower levels of 
receptivity to advertising, such 
as recall of ads without affective 
response, have been associated 
with later initiation of alcohol use.18 
Furthermore, researchers who have 
combined recall and liking measures 
into an “any receptivity” construct 
have identified associations with 
first use of both cigarettes19, 
20 and 
alcohol21. Visual prompting (aided 
recall) is necessary to obtain valid 
measures.22 We know of no study 
that has sampled a substantial 
proportion of all available tobacco 
advertising and reported population 
estimates for aided recall of either 
individual ads or ads for a product 
category.
Susceptibility to smoking is a 
validated measure that predicts 
the risk of smoking initiation as 
many as 3 to 4 years before first 
experimentation.23 
– 
25 A series of 
questions identifies “committed 
never users” as those who have 
never been curious about use, have 
strong intentions not to use, and who 
would resist an offer to use from a 
best friend. All other never users are 
considered susceptible. Susceptibility 
and subsequent experimentation 
vary across sociodemographic 
variables, receptivity to tobacco 
marketing, 
16, 
17 exposure to other 
tobacco users, 
26 use of another 
psychoactive substance, 
27 use of 
another tobacco product, 
28 and 
psychosocial variables such as 
externalizing problem behaviors 
(eg, rule-breaking, aggression), 
29 
internalizing problem behaviors 
(eg, depression, anxiety), 
30 and 
sensation-seeking.31
This study explores levels of 
receptivity to the marketing of 
e-cigarettes, cigarettes, cigars, 
and smokeless tobacco products 
among never-using 12 to 17 year 
olds, with the use of data from the 
national Population Assessment 
of Tobacco and Health (PATH) 
Study. The study design allowed 
us to assess adolescent receptivity 
to advertising for multiple tobacco 
products and to summarize this 
in a measure of receptivity to any 
tobacco advertising. We investigated 
whether this general receptivity to 
tobacco advertising was associated 
with susceptibility to use any tobacco 
product. Finally, we investigated 
the associations of advertising 
receptivity to each product with 
susceptibility to cigarette smoking.
MeThods
adolescent sample
Data are from wave 1 of the 
PATH study, which is a nationally 
representative sample of the civilian, 
noninstitutionalized US population, 
aged ≥12 years between September 
2013 and December 2014.32, 
 
33 
With oversight from the National 
Institute of Drug Abuse and the Food 
and Drug Administration, Westat 
collected data with the use of audio-
computer–assisted self-interviews. 
Westat’s Institutional Review Board 
approved the study design/protocol, 
and the Office of Management and 
Budget approved the data collection. 
Households were identified by using 
an address-based, area-probability 
sampling method, and a screener 
survey enumerated household 
members (response rate = 54%). 
Generally, all youth aged 12 to 17 
years (maximum 2 per household) 
were selected for interview, and 
parental consent and youth assent 
were obtained. Interviews were 
completed for 78.4% of selected 
youth. The data were weighted to 
adjust for the complex sample design 
and nonresponse to allow population 
estimates. If the respondent did not 
answer regarding their age, sex, 
race, or Hispanic ethnicity, these 
were obtained from the household 
screener (n = 704 or 6.6%) or, if 
not available, by using statistical 
imputation methods (n = 143 or 
1.3%).34 In this article, our analyses 
were restricted to the 10 751 of 
the youth sample (N = 13 651) who

reported that they had never used 
any tobacco product.
dependent Variable: susceptibility 
To use Tobacco Products and 
cigarettes
Following previous research, 
23, 
 
24 
never users who had heard of the 
product were classified as either 
susceptible to use or committed 
never users on the basis of their 
responses to 3 questions assessing 
their curiosity about the product, 
intention to try it in the near future, 
and likely response if a best friend 
were to offer them the product (see 
Supplemental Information). Only 
those with the strongest rejection 
to all 3 questions were categorized 
as committed never users to each of 
the following 8 products (cigarettes, 
e-cigarettes, pipes, cigars, hookahs, 
smokeless tobacco, dissolvable 
tobacco, and bidis/kreteks). The 
strongest rejection to all questions 
for all products classified an 
individual as a committed never 
tobacco user; all others were 
considered to be susceptible to use 
≥1 products. For this analysis, those 
who had never heard of a product 
were considered to be committed 
never users.
Key independent Variable: 
Receptivity to Tobacco Product 
advertising
Favorite Ad
Respondents were asked “What is 
the brand of your favorite tobacco 
advertisement?” A list of brands was 
provided, with an option to nominate 
another brand. We assumed that 
identifying Marlboro or Camel as 
favorite referred to cigarettes, unless 
snus was specifically mentioned.
Aided Recall and Liking of 
Contemporary Ads
Respondents were shown, 1 at a 
time, a stratified random set of 20 
tobacco advertisements (5 for each of 
the following 4 products: cigarettes, 
e-cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless 
products) from 959 recently used 
print, direct mail, Internet, and 
television ads. We purchased all 
available ads (i.e. a near census) from 
2 commercial ad-monitoring firms 
(Competitrack and Mintel). The initial 
ad pool (period 1 [P1]) was refreshed 
once in January 2014 (period 2 [P2]). 
Within each of the 4 product sets, 
randomization was within substrata 
levels. The 5 cigarette ads always 
contained a randomized print ad for 
Marlboro (P1: n = 43 ads; P2: n = 27 
ads), Camel (P1: n = 36; P2: n = 36), 
and Newport (P1: n = 88; P2: n = 
52), which made up 76% of available 
print ads for cigarettes. The final 2 
cigarette ads were randomly selected 
from other brand ads (P1: n = 59; 
P2: n = 26). The 5 smokeless tobacco 
print ads included 2 randomly 
selected ads for snus products (P1: 
n = 56; P2: n = 21), 2 for oral dip 
products (P1: n = 99; P2: n = 62), 
and 1 for chew products (P1: n = 
2; P2: n = 3). The cigar set included 
1 randomly chosen from the large 
cigars set (P1: n = 200; P2: n = 134) 
and 4 randomly chosen from the  
little cigars and cigarillos set (P1:  
n = 45; P2: n = 6). The e-cigarette set 
included 2 ads that were “still shots” 
of television ads (P1: n = 11; P2: n = 
24). The remaining 3 e-cigarette ads 
were chosen randomly from print 
ads (P1: n = 59; P2: n = 68). The 
frequency with which each brand 
was presented to respondents was a 
function of how many ads there were 
for a given product in the ad pool and 
the total number of ads in each pool.
For each ad presented, respondents 
were asked if they had seen the ad 
in the past 12 months and whether 
they liked the ad. We categorized 
receptivity for each product category 
as follows: (1) no receptivity (no 
recall or liking of any of the 5 ads and 
no indication of a favorite ad that 
was for the category’s product), (2) 
low receptivity (recall of at least 1 ad 
but no indication of liking any ad in 
the category or having a favorite ad 
that was for the category’s product), 
(3) moderate receptivity (liking at 
least 1 of the ads or naming a favorite 
ad that was for the category’s 
product), and (4) high receptivity 
(liking at least 1 of the ads and a 
having favorite ad that was for the 
category’s product).
Recall of advertisements by brand
The above sampling scheme allowed 
some respondents to see >1 ad for a 
brand within a category, particularly 
for the little cigars and cigarillos set 
in P2. When >1 ad was shown for a 
brand, aided recall was assessed only 
on the first ad that was displayed. 
We computed the estimated recall 
rate as the weighted proportion of 
respondents who recalled seeing 
an ad for the brand out of the total 
number of respondents who were 
shown an ad for the brand. Before 
ranking brands on the frequency 
of recall, we removed brands with 
advertisements that were shown to 
<500 participants. Thus, for the rank 
order of aided recall, we considered 
a total of 55 tobacco brands (9 
cigarette brands, 9 e-cigarette brands 
with television ads, 14 e-cigarette 
brands with print ads, 9 smokeless 
brands, and 14 cigar brands).
other covariates of Tobacco use in 
adolescence
Exposure to Tobacco Use
All respondents were asked: “Does 
anyone who lives with you now 
use any of the following: [list of 
tobacco products]” and “During the 
past 7 days, about how many hours 
were you around others who were 
smoking? Include time in your home, 
in a car, at school or outdoors.” 
We report 2 binary variables: 1 for 
household exposure (no users of 
tobacco in the household versus 
any) and 1 for general exposure (no 
exposure to smoking by others in the 
past 7 days versus any).
Use of Other Drugs or Alcohol
Ever use was ascertained for alcohol, 
marijuana, as well as for misuse 
of prescription drugs (ie, Ritalin/
3

Adderall, painkillers, sedatives, 
tranquilizers), cocaine or crack, 
methamphetamine or speed, heroin, 
inhalants, solvents, and hallucinogens 
by a series of questions: “Have 
you ever used [substance]?” (See 
Supplemental Information for the 
full list of questions). Adolescents 
who reported ever use of any of 
these were classified as “any use”; all 
others were classified as “no use.”
Psychosocial Predictors of Tobacco Use
We adjusted for mental health and 
substance use problems by using 
scales from the Global Appraisal of 
Individual Needs–Short Screener.35 
The internalizing subscale (α = .81) 
included 4 items of depressive and 
anxiety symptoms. The externalizing 
subscale (α = .70) included 
experience with 5 conduct and 
behavioral items. The substance use 
problems subscale (α = .67) asked 7 
questions about problems associated 
with alcohol or drug use. Adolescents 
were scored on how many items 
they had experienced in the past 
month or past 2 to 12 months (see 
Supplemental Information for 
questions). In addition, sensation 
seeking (α = .74) was assessed by 
3 items modified from the Brief 
Sensation Seeking Scale.36 On all 
scales, respondents were scored 
as having no symptoms (0), low to 
moderate symptom levels (1–2), or 
high symptom levels (≥3).
statistical analyses
Analyses were performed by 
using SAS Software, version 9.3 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC).37 We 
used the survey weights supplied 
with the data, and computed 
variances and P values by using the 
recommended Balanced Repeated 
Replication method with Fay = 
0.3.27, 
 
33, 
 
38 Weighted percentages 
were calculated with SAS version 
9.3 PROC SURVEYFREQ. Modified 
Wilson confidence limits for 
proportions were calculated on 
the weighted estimates by using 
PROC SURVEYFREQ. Separate 
logistic regression models tested 
the association of receptivity to 
any tobacco advertising with 
susceptibility to any tobacco product, 
as well as with susceptibility to 
cigarette smoking. These models 
controlled for the above-mentioned 
covariates. χ2 Tests were also 
conducted to test for significant 
differences between percentage 
recall of pairs of selected ad 
brands or modes. Odds ratios, 
confidence limits, and P values 
are reported from the weighted, 
adjusted model (calculated via PROC 
SURVEYLOGISTIC).
ResulTs
demographic characteristics
This sample of adolescent never 
tobacco users was balanced on sex 
and had a high proportion of younger 
adolescents (12–13 years: 39.5%; 
14–15 years: 34.1%; 16–17 years: 
26.4%) (Table 1). Just over half were 
non-Hispanic white (53.6%), 22.4% 
were Hispanic, 14.4% were non-
Hispanic African American, 5.2% 
were Asian, and 4.5% were other 
races/ethnicities. Most adolescents 
(82.0%) had parents who completed 
high school, and 60.7% had parents 
with at least some college education. 
Never tobacco users who were not 
receptive to any tobacco advertising 
(54%) had the lowest susceptibility 
to any tobacco use (34.3%; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 32.9%–
35.6%). Among never users with 
low receptivity (34%), 50.4% (95% 
CI: 48.5%–52.2%) were susceptible. 
Among the 10% of never users 
who had a moderate receptivity, 
65.4% (95% CI: 62.2%–68.4%) 
were susceptible. Among the <2% of 
never users with high receptivity to 
tobacco advertising, 87.7% (95% CI: 
81.2%–92.2%) were susceptible to 
any tobacco product.
Receptivity to Tobacco advertising
Overall, 41.0% of 12 to 13 year olds 
and approximately half of both 14 to 
15 year olds and 16 to 17 year olds 
were classified as being receptive to 
any tobacco advertising (Table 2). 
Approximately one-third of each age 
group had a low level of receptivity. 
There were significantly fewer 12 
to 13 year olds with moderate or 
high receptivity (8.8%) compared 
with 16- to 17-year-old adolescents 
(15.0%) (P < .001).
E-cigarette ads generated the 
highest proportion of adolescents 
who were receptive. For 12 to 13 
year olds, 27.8% were receptive 
to ads for e-cigarettes, 21.5% to 
ads for cigarettes, 14.8% to ads 
for smokeless tobacco, and 7.9% 
to ads for cigars. For 16 to 17 year 
olds (14–15 year olds had similar 
numbers), 32.7% were receptive 
to ads for e-cigarettes, 25.0% to 
ads for cigarettes, 20.5% to ads for 
smokeless tobacco, and 12.6% to ads 
for cigars.
In multivariable logistic regression 
(Table 1) controlling for potential 
confounding variables, even low 
receptivity to any tobacco ads 
was significantly associated with 
increased concurrent susceptibility 
to use any tobacco product (adjusted 
odds ratio [aOR]: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.25–
1.53). Moderate and high receptivity 
levels had higher and significant odds 
ratios (moderate: aOR = 2.39, P < 
.001; high: aOR = 6.73, P < .001).
aided Recall for Tobacco advertising 
by brand
Four of the top 10 recalled ads were 
television ads for e-cigarettes and 
half of the top 20 recalled ads were 
for e-cigarette brands (Table 3). The 
television ads for Blu e-cigarettes 
were recalled the most (31.0%; 95% 
CI: 29.5%–32.5%) followed by Blu 
print ads (22.3%; 95% CI: 21.1%–
23.6%). Recall of Blu television ads 
was significantly higher than that 
for Blu print ads (P < .001 for each 
age group and overall). Recall of Blu 
print ads was significantly higher 
than that for either Grizzly (the third 
most recalled brand ads) or Camel

Receptivity With susceptibility to 
cigarette smoking
In our multivariable logistic 
regression controlling for potential 
covariates, moderate to high 
receptivity to cigarettes (aOR: 1.57; 
95% CI: 1.25–1.98), e-cigarettes 
(aOR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.21–1.94), 
and smokeless tobacco (aOR: 1.58; 
CI: 1.23–2.03) was significantly 
associated with concurrent 
susceptibility to smoke cigarettes 
(Table 4), which was not the case 
for moderate to high receptivity 
to cigar advertising. A low level 
of receptivity to any of the 4 
forms of tobacco advertising was 
not associated with concurrent 
susceptibility to smoke  
cigarettes.
discussion
With the use of stratified random 
sampling, we selected 20 ads to 
present to each respondent, from 
a near census of recent cigarette, 
e-cigarette, smokeless tobacco, and 
cigar ads to assess population levels 
of receptivity to tobacco advertising 
among US adolescents who had 
never used tobacco. Receptivity 
was highest for e-cigarettes, 
followed by cigarettes, smokeless 
tobacco, and cigars. Aided recall 
of a tobacco ad (without liking or 
a favorite) was categorized as a 
low level of receptivity to tobacco 
advertising and was present in 
34% of adolescents. Those with 
a low receptivity to a product’s 
advertising were significantly more 
likely to be concurrently susceptible 
to use a tobacco product than those 
who were not receptive. The 12% 
of adolescents with a moderate 
to high receptivity to advertising 
for each of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, 
and smokeless products were 
significantly more likely to be 
concurrently susceptible to smoke 
cigarettes. We hypothesize that 
low levels of receptivity may be 
associated with committed never 
smokers becoming susceptible over 
the following year and propose to 
test this hypothesis with wave 2 
data from the PATH study. Evidence 
in this article is consistent with 
the idea that tobacco industry 
advertising builds a general interest 
in tobacco use (cigarette smoking, 
in particular), in addition to any 
effect in encouraging the use of 
a particular product brand. In 
addition, because youth receptivity 
to tobacco product marketing may 
be driven by product, brand, and 
ad-level factors, research identifying 
the most critical factors will be 
important to inform regulatory 
policy.
Despite marketing restrictions 
on cigarettes and other products, 
tobacco advertising continues 
to reach one-third to one-half of 
adolescents, depending on age. 
E-cigarette advertising generated 
the highest reach. This dominance 
of e-cigarettes is in stark contrast

externalizing, internalizing, sensation seeking, or substance use problems), and use of other substances. An indicator for receptivity to each of the product categories was included in the

to the advertising expenditures for 
each product over the study period: 
>$9 billion/year for cigarettes, 
39 
$415 million/year for smokeless 
products, 
40 and only $60 million/
year for e-cigarettes4 (although 
this latter amount appears to be 
growing substantially each year). 
One explanation for receptivity 
being highest for the product with 
the lowest marketing budget4 is 
that the product with minimal 
marketing restrictions may have 
a significant advantage. Products 
with less-restricted marketing can 
use marketing synergies across 
multiple media channels, which 
are likely more cost-effective 
than campaigns for products with 
significant marketing restrictions.41 
It has been noted that television 
is still among the most effective 
advertising platforms in the  
United States.42 In this study,  
4 of the top 10 ads recalled were 
e-cigarette television ads,  
which made up only a portion  
of the e-cigarette marketing 
expenditures, a budget that was 
2 orders of magnitude below the 
cigarette marketing budget.4, 
 
39 Our 
results suggest that, even though 
cigarettes are not allowed to be 
advertised on television, interest 
in them may be increased through 
observing ads for other tobacco 
products. This topic, along with 
how receptivity may affect harm 
perceptions, will be explored in 
separate longitudinal analyses of 
PATH study data.
Two major study strengths are its 
large nationally representative 
sample of adolescents and the use 
of a stratified random sample from 
a near census of recent tobacco 
advertising images to gauge reach 
and receptivity. A limitation 
is that our findings are cross-
sectional and the directionality of 
associations cannot be determined. 
However, susceptibility has been 
a consistent precursor of risk of 
smoking initiation2 and, in the 
PATH study wave 1, susceptibility 
to use tobacco among 12 to 17 year 
olds appears to be equivalent to 
the prevalence of experimentation 
for those aged a few years older.43 
Moreover, this sample will be 
followed longitudinally, allowing 
us to confirm whether both low 
and moderate/high receptivity to 
tobacco advertising predicts later 
tobacco use behavior among these 
never smokers.
conclusions
In this survey, 41% of US 12 to  
13 year olds, as well as half of older 
adolescents who had never used 
tobacco, were receptive to tobacco 
adverting and this receptivity 
was associated with increased 
susceptibility to cigarette smoking, 
regardless of the type of tobacco 
product advertised. Indeed, there 
was no difference in the association 
between receptivity for advertising 
for the different tobacco products 
and susceptibility to cigarette 
smoking. E-cigarette advertising was 
the most recalled by US adolescents, 
particularly ads that were shown on 
television. This high level of recall 
was achieved despite e-cigarette 
advertising expenditures being 
a fraction of those for cigarette 
marketing.
