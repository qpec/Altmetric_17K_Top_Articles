BACKGROUND
B cells influence the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. Ocrelizumab is a human-
ized monoclonal antibody that selectively depletes CD20+ B cells.
METHODS
In two identical phase 3 trials, we randomly assigned 821 and 835 patients with 
relapsing multiple sclerosis to receive intravenous ocrelizumab at a dose of 600 mg 
every 24 weeks or subcutaneous interferon beta-1a at a dose of 44 μg three times 
weekly for 96 weeks. The primary end point was the annualized relapse rate.
RESULTS
The annualized relapse rate was lower with ocrelizumab than with interferon beta-1a 
in trial 1 (0.16 vs. 0.29; 46% lower rate with ocrelizumab; P<0.001) and in trial 2 (0.16 
vs. 0.29; 47% lower rate; P<0.001). In prespecified pooled analyses, the percentage of 
patients with disability progression confirmed at 12 weeks was significantly lower 
with ocrelizumab than with interferon beta-1a (9.1% vs. 13.6%; hazard ratio, 0.60; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.81; P<0.001), as was the percentage of patients 
with disability progression confirmed at 24 weeks (6.9% vs. 10.5%; hazard ratio, 0.60; 
95% CI, 0.43 to 0.84; P 
= 
0.003). The mean number of gadolinium-enhancing le-
sions per T1-weighted magnetic resonance scan was 0.02 with ocrelizumab versus 
0.29 with interferon beta-1a in trial 1 (94% lower number of lesions with ocreliz-
umab, P<0.001) and 0.02 versus 0.42 in trial 2 (95% lower number of lesions, 
P<0.001). The change in the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite score (a com-
posite measure of walking speed, upper-limb movements, and cognition; for this 
z score, negative values indicate worsening and positive values indicate improve-
ment) significantly favored ocrelizumab over interferon beta-1a in trial 2 (0.28 vs. 
0.17, P 
= 
0.004) but not in trial 1 (0.21 vs. 0.17, P 
= 
0.33). Infusion-related reactions 
occurred in 34.3% of the patients treated with ocrelizumab. Serious infection oc-
curred in 1.3% of the patients treated with ocrelizumab and in 2.9% of those 
treated with interferon beta-1a. Neoplasms occurred in 0.5% of the patients 
treated with ocrelizumab and in 0.2% of those treated with interferon beta-1a.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis, ocrelizumab was associated with 
lower rates of disease activity and progression than interferon beta-1a over a period 
of 96 weeks. Larger and longer studies of the safety of ocrelizumab are required.

espite the availability of several 
disease-modifying treatments for relaps-
ing forms of multiple sclerosis, patients 
often continue to have clinical and subclinical 
disease activity, and neurologic disability continues 
to accrue. Thus, there is a need for more effective 
treatments with acceptable safety profiles.1-3
B cells are thought to influence the underly-
ing pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis by means 
of antigen presentation,4 autoantibody produc-
tion,5,6 cytokine regulation,4 and the formation 
of ectopic lymphoid aggregates in the meninges, 
which possibly contribute to cortical demyelin-
ation and neurodegeneration.7,8 Ocrelizumab is a 
humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively 
targets CD20, a cell-surface antigen that is expressed 
on pre-B cells, mature B cells, and memory B cells 
but not on lymphoid stem cells and plasma cells.9 
Humanized anti-CD20 antibody was designed to 
reduce immunogenicity, which was shown in a 
phase 2 study.10 Ocrelizumab binds to the large 
extracellular loop of CD20 with high affinity, 
selectively depleting CD20-expressing B cells11,12 
while preserving the capacity for B-cell recon-
stitution and preexisting humoral immunity.13,14 
B-cell depletion is achieved by means of several 
mechanisms, including antibody-dependent cell-
mediated phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cell-
mediated cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cy-
totoxicity, and induction of apoptosis.15
On the basis of results from previous phase 2 
studies of the chimeric anti-CD20 antibody ritux-
imab16 and ocrelizumab,10 we undertook two 
phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group 
trials (OPERA I and OPERA II) to investigate the 
efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab, as compared 
with subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, in patients 
with relapsing multiple sclerosis. The two trials 
used identical protocols but were conducted in-
dependently at nonoverlapping trial sites (see the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org).
Methods
Trial Oversight
The sponsor, F. Hoffmann–La Roche, designed 
the trials in consultation with members of the 
OPERA I and OPERA II steering committee. Data 
were collected by the site investigators, queries 
were responded to by site personnel, and the data 
were analyzed by the sponsor; the aggregated and 
individual results of the participants were reviewed 
by the sponsor and steering committee. An inde-
pendent data and safety monitoring committee 
reviewed ongoing safety data and provided guid-
ance on trial continuation, modification, or ter-
mination (see the Study Oversight section in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
All the authors vouch for the accuracy and 
completeness of the data and for the fidelity of 
the trial to the protocol. A subgroup of authors, 
which included academic authors and authors who 
are employees of the sponsor, drafted the manu-
script, and all the authors approved the final 
version and made the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication. Medical-writing as-
sistance was funded by the sponsor. The trial 
was conducted in accordance with the Interna-
tional Conference on Harmonisation guidelines 
for Good Clinical Practice17 and the Declaration 
of Helsinki.18
Patients
Key eligibility criteria included an age of 18 to 
55 years; a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (accord-
ing to the 2010 revised McDonald criteria19); an 
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 
0 to 5.5 at screening (scores range from 0 to 10.0, 
with higher scores indicating a greater degree of 
disability20); at least two documented clinical re-
lapses within the previous 2 years or one clinical 
relapse within the year before screening; magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showing 
abnormalities consistent with multiple sclerosis; 
and no neurologic worsening for at least 30 days 
before both screening and baseline (day 1 trial 
visit). The key exclusion criteria were a diagnosis 
of primary progressive multiple sclerosis, previ-
ous treatment with any B-cell–targeted therapy or 
other immunosuppressive medication as defined 
in the protocol (available at NEJM.org; also see 
the Additional Methodology Details section in 
the Supplementary Appendix), and a disease dura-
tion of more than 10 years in combination with 
an EDSS score of 2.0 or less at screening. All the 
patients provided written informed consent.
Trial Design
In the OPERA I trial, patients from 141 trial sites 
across 32 countries underwent randomization be-
tween August 31, 2011, and February 14, 2013. 
In the OPERA II trial, patients from 166 trial sites

Ocrelizumab vs. Interferon Beta-1a in Relapsing MS
across 24 countries underwent randomization 
between September 20, 2011, and March 28, 2013. 
Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 
to receive ocrelizumab at a dose of 600 mg by 
means of intravenous infusion every 24 weeks, 
administered as two 300-mg infusions on days 
1 and 15 for the first dose and as a single 600-mg 
infusion thereafter, or interferon beta-1a at a dose 
of 44 μg (Rebif, EMD Serono), administered sub-
cutaneously three times weekly throughout the 
96-week treatment period (Fig. S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Patients in each group re-
ceived a matching subcutaneous or intravenous 
placebo, as appropriate. All the patients received 
one 100-mg dose of intravenous methylpredniso-
lone before each infusion. Prophylaxis with anal-
gesic or antipyretic agents and an antihistamine 
was recommended, but the decision to use these 
medications was left up to the infusion center. 
Adjustment of the infusion rate and treatment of 
symptoms during infusion were permitted in or-
der to manage infusion-related reactions.
Randomization was performed centrally with 
the use of an independent interactive Web-response 
system. Each trial center had separate treating 
and examining investigators, all of whom were 
unaware of the treatment assignments through-
out the trial. The examining investigator conducted 
the neurologic assessments, including the Mul-
tiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (a compos-
ite quantitative measure, expressed as a z score, 
of walking speed, upper-limb coordinated move-
ments, and cognition; for this z score, negative 
values indicate worsening and positive values 
indicate improvement)21 and the EDSS. The EDSS 
assessment and data collection were captured 
with the use of a real-time, electronic data-entry 
system in conjunction with an algorithm and 
central consistency check and feedback on the 
basis of expert review. MRI scans were analyzed 
centrally at an MRI reading center by personnel 
who were unaware of the treatment assignments. 
Details are provided in the protocol, including 
the statistical analysis plan, and in Table S9 in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Trial Procedures and End Points
The primary end point was the annualized relapse 
rate by 96 weeks, which reflects the number of 
relapses meeting the prespecified criteria that were 
observed per person-year of follow-up (see the 
Supplementary Appendix). There were 10 hierar-
chically ordered secondary end points: the pro-
portion of patients with disability progression 
confirmed at 12 weeks in a pooled time-to-event 
analysis of both trials through week 96, in which 
disability progression was defined as an increase 
from the baseline EDSS score of at least 1.0 point 
(or 0.5 points if the baseline EDSS score was >5.5) 
that was sustained for at least 12 weeks; the total 
(cumulative) mean number of gadolinium-enhanc-
ing lesions identified on T1-weighted MRI of the 
brain at weeks 24, 48, and 96; the total number 
of new or newly enlarged hyperintense lesions 
on T2-weighted MRI of the brain at weeks 24, 48, 
and 96; a pooled analysis of the proportion of 
patients with disability improvement confirmed 
at 12 weeks through week 96, which was defined 
as a reduction from the baseline EDSS score of at 
least 1.0 point (or 0.5 points if the baseline EDSS 
score was >5.5) that was sustained for at least 
12 weeks in patients with a baseline EDSS score 
of at least 2.0; a pooled time-to-event analysis 
of the rate of disability progression confirmed at 
24 weeks through week 96; the total number of 
new hypointense lesions on T1-weighted MRI 
of the brain at weeks 24, 48, and 96; the change 
in the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite 
score from baseline to week 96; the percentage 
change in brain volume from week 24 to week 96; 
the change in the physical-component summary 
score of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item 
Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36, on which scores 
range from 0 to 100, and higher scores indicate 
better physical health–related quality of life) from 
baseline to week 96; and the proportion of pa-
tients with a baseline EDSS score of at least 2.0 
who had no evidence of disease activity (defined 
as no relapse, no disability progression con-
firmed at 12 weeks or at 24 weeks, no new or 
newly enlarged lesions on T2-weighted MRI, and 
no gadolinium-enhancing lesions on T1-weighted 
MRI) by week 96. The analysis of percentage 
change in brain volume was performed with the 
use of SIENA/X software.22 Additional secondary 
end points were the pharmacokinetics, pharmaco-
dynamics, and immunogenicity of ocrelizumab; 
and the safety profile of ocrelizumab.
Statistical Analysis
We performed efficacy analyses in the intention-
to-treat population (all the patients who under-
went randomization) or, for the end point of no 
evidence of disease activity, in a modified inten-

tion-to-treat population that excluded patients who 
were withdrawn from the trial for reasons other 
than efficacy failure or death and who had no 
evidence of clinical disease activity at the time of 
treatment discontinuation in the trial. The an-
nualized relapse rate was analyzed with the use 
of a negative binomial model testing for treatment 
differences between ocrelizumab and interferon 
beta-1a, with adjustment according to geograph-
ic region and baseline EDSS score. A significant 
result at a two-sided alpha of 0.05 would show 
the superiority of ocrelizumab with regard to a 
lower annualized relapse rate than that observed 
with interferon beta-1a.
The sample size for each trial was based on 
an estimated annualized relapse rate of 0.165 in 
the ocrelizumab group and 0.33 in the interfer-
on beta-1a group. Using a two-sided t-test, we 
calculated that a sample of 400 patients per 
group would provide the trials with 84% statisti-
cal power to maintain a type I error rate of 0.05 
and to detect a 50% lower rate with ocrelizumab 
than with interferon beta-1a (assuming a with-
drawal rate of approximately 20%).
According to the statistical analysis plans of 
the individual trials, 10 secondary efficacy end 
points were prespecified to be tested in a hierar-
chical order at a two-sided alpha of 0.05 (see the 
Supplementary Appendix). Seven end points of 
this hierarchy were to be tested in each individ-
ual trial, and three end points (disability pro-
gression confirmed at 12 weeks and at 24 weeks 
and disability improvement confirmed at 12 weeks) 
were to be assessed in the pooled data set. From 
the first P value that was above 0.05, all subse-
quent P values in the predetermined hierarchy 
were considered to be nonconfirmatory (i.e., de-
scriptive only). (See the Statistical Analysis section 
in the Supplementary Appendix.)
All patients who received any study treatment 
were included in the safety population. All data 
collected during the double-blind, double-dummy 
treatment period and the safety follow-up were 
included in the main safety analyses. Data from 
patients who entered the safety follow-up earlier 
than week 96 were included in this analysis 
from the time that they entered the safety fol-
low-up until week 96. Safety outcomes are re-
ported for the individual trials with the exception 
of herpesvirus infections and neoplasms, for 
which pooled data are presented because of low 
incidences.
Results
Patients
Overall, 1656 patients underwent randomization 
(intention-to-treat population), with 821 patients 
in the OPERA I trial and 835 in the OPERA II 
trial. The demographic and disease characteristics 
at baseline were similar in the assigned groups in 
the two trials (Table 1). In the OPERA I trial, 366 
of 410 patients (89.3%) in the ocrelizumab group 
and 340 of 411 (82.7%) in the interferon beta-1a 
group completed the 96-week treatment; in the 
OPERA II trial, 360 of 417 patients (86.3%) and 
320 of 418 (76.6%), respectively, completed the 
96-week treatment (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). There was no interaction between 
treatment group and trial, which allowed the 
pooling of data for the prespecified planned hi-
erarchical analysis (Table S9 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). In the pooled analysis, which 
included 827 patients treated with ocrelizumab 
and 829 treated with interferon beta-1a, all the 
primary and secondary end points significantly 
favored the ocrelizumab group over the interferon 
beta-1a group.
Efficacy
Relapses
Clinical, MRI, and patient-reported outcomes are 
summarized in Table 2. The primary end point, 
the annualized relapse rate at 96 weeks, in the 
OPERA I trial was 0.16 in the ocrelizumab group, 
as compared with 0.29 in the interferon beta-1a 
group (difference, 0.14 annualized relapses [dif-
ferences are based on unrounded data]). In the 
OPERA II trial, the annualized relapse rate was 
0.16 in the ocrelizumab group, as compared with 
0.29 in the interferon beta-1a group (difference, 
0.14 annualized relapses) (Table 2). These findings 
indicate a 46% lower annualized relapse rate with 
ocrelizumab in the OPERA I trial and a 47% lower 
rate with ocrelizumab in the OPERA II trial 
(P<0.001 for both comparisons).
Disability
In the prespecified pooled analysis, the percent-
age of patients with disability progression con-
firmed at 12 weeks was 9.1% in the ocrelizumab 
group, as compared with 13.6% in the interferon 
beta-1a group (40% lower risk with ocrelizumab; 
hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.45 to 0.81; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A). Over the 96-week

Plus–minus values are means ±SD. The intention-to-treat population included all the patients who underwent randomization. There were no 
significant differences in the baseline characteristics between groups in each trial and between the two trials. A full listing of countries in-
volved in the trials is provided in the Supplementary Appendix. Data on the number of relapses within the previous 12 months were missing 
for 1 patient in the interferon beta-1a group in the OPERA I trial and for 1 patient in each group in the OPERA II trial. Data on the number 
and volume of lesions on T2-weighted MRI were missing for 2 patients in the ocrelizumab group and for 3 in the interferon beta-1a group in 
the OPERA I trial and for 3 in the ocrelizumab group and 2 in the interferon beta-1a group in the OPERA II trial. Data on the normalized 
brain volume were missing for 4 patients in the ocrelizumab group and for 7 in the interferon beta-1a group in the OPERA I trial and for 3 in 
the ocrelizumab group and 4 in the interferon beta-1a group in the OPERA II trial.
†  
Data include patients who were untreated with any disease-modifying therapy in the 2 years before screening. The inclusion criteria did not 
select for untreated patients.
‡  
Data on previous treatment were collected only for the 2 years before screening. Patients could be counted in several categories. Treatment 
with cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, or methotrexate within 2 years before screening was an exclu-
sion criterion. Patients treated with natalizumab were eligible for the trial only if the duration of treatment with natalizumab was less than  
1 year. Other medications were intravenous immune globulin, mycophenolate mofetil, and azathioprine (protocol deviation if ≤24 months 
before screening).
§  
Scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) range from 0 to 10.0, with higher scores indicating worse disability.20 Data were 
missing for one patient in the interferon beta-1a group in the OPERA I trial.

All rate ratios, hazard ratios, and difference values are for the ocrelizumab group versus the interferon beta-1a group. The order of the secondary end points according to the hierarchi-
cal analysis plan is provided in the Statistical Analysis section in the Supplementary Appendix.
†  
Only the pooled analysis was prespecified. The individual-trial results are presented for additional context and transparency. Disability progression that was confirmed at 12 or 24 weeks 
was defined as an increase from the baseline EDSS score of at least 1.0 point (or 0.5 points if the baseline EDSS score was >5.5) that was sustained for at least 12 or 24 weeks. 
Disability improvement that was confirmed at 12 weeks was defined as a reduction from the baseline EDSS score of at least 1.0 point (or 0.5 points if the baseline EDSS score was 
>5.5) that was sustained for at least 12 weeks in patients with a baseline EDSS score of at least 2.0
‡  
For these end points, individual-trial-level P values were not part of the hierarchical statistical analysis testing procedure.
§ 
 
The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) consists of a composite quantitative measure of walking speed, upper-limb coordinated movements, and cognition; for this  
z score (numerical value reflects the number of standard deviations from a reference population), negative values indicate worsening and positive values indicate improvement in 
function.21 MSFC scores were adjusted according to baseline MSFC score, interaction between baseline MSFC score and visit, geographic region (United States vs. the rest of the 
world), and baseline EDSS score (<4.0 vs. ≥4.0).23
¶  
The physical-component summary score of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better physical 
health–related quality of life.
‖ 
 
Nominal P values are reported but are nonconfirmatory (i.e., descriptive only) as a consequence of the failure in the statistical hierarchical testing procedure.
**  
No evidence of disease activity was defined as no protocol-defined relapse, no events of disability progression confirmed at 12 weeks, no new or newly enlarged lesions on T2-
weighted MRI, and no gadolinium-enhancing lesions. As prespecified, the end point of no evidence of disease activity was assessed in a modified intention-to-treat population that 
 
excluded patients who were withdrawn for reasons other than efficacy failure or death and who did not have clinical disease activity at the time of treatment discontinuation in the trial.
††  
The total number of lesions was calculated as the sum of the individual number of lesions at weeks 24, 48, and 96, divided by the total number of MRI scans of the brain.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
trial period, the rate of disability progression con-
firmed at 24 weeks was 6.9% in the ocrelizumab 
group, as compared with 10.5% in the interferon 
beta-1a group (40% lower risk with ocrelizumab; 
hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.84; P 
= 
0.003) 
(Fig. 1B). The effect of ocrelizumab on the risk 
of confirmed disability progression in each of the 
two trials was consistent with the prespecified 
pooled analysis (Table 2).
In a pooled analysis, the percentage of pa-
tients with disability improvement confirmed at 
12 weeks was 20.7% in the ocrelizumab group, 
as compared with 15.6% in the interferon beta-
1a group (33% higher rate of improvement with 
ocrelizumab, P 
= 
0.02) (Fig. S5 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). The effect of ocrelizumab on the 
rate of confirmed disability improvement was sig-
nificant in the OPERA I trial but nonsignificant in 
the OPERA II trial (Table 2).
The difference in the adjusted mean change 
in the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite 
score from baseline to week 96 between the 
ocrelizumab group and the interferon beta-1a 
group was 0.04 in the OPERA I trial (P 
= 
0.33, 
which was the first nonsignificant P value in the 
hierarchical testing) and 0.11 in the OPERA II 
trial (P 
= 
0.004) (Table 2, and Fig. S6 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). As a result of the failure in 
the statistical hierarchical testing, all the P values 
for the subsequent secondary efficacy end points, 
including the change in the SF-36 quality-of-life 
physical-component summary and the measure 
of no evidence of disease activity, were considered 
to be nonconfirmatory.
In the intention-to-treat population in the 
OPERA I trial, 47.9% of the patients in the ocreliz-
umab group had no evidence of disease activity 
by 96 weeks (exploratory end point), as compared 
with 29.2% of those in the interferon beta-1a 
group. In the OPERA II trial, 47.5% of the patients 
in the ocrelizumab group had no evidence of dis-
ease activity by 96 weeks, as compared with 25.1% 
of those in the interferon beta-1a group. These 
findings were considered to be nonconfirmatory 
as a result of failure of the hierarchical analysis 
(Table 2, and Table S6 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
MRI-Related Secondary End Points
The total mean number of gadolinium-enhancing 
lesions per T1-weighted MRI scan in the OPERA I 
trial was 0.02 with ocrelizumab versus 0.29 with 
interferon beta-1a (94% lower number of lesions 
with ocrelizumab, P<0.001). The values in the 
OPERA II trial were 0.02 with ocrelizumab versus 
0.42 with interferon beta-1a (95% lower number 
of lesions with ocrelizumab, P<0.001) (Table 2 
Figure 1. Key Secondary Clinical End Points.
Shown are the proportions of patients with disability progression con-
firmed at 12 weeks (first secondary end point; Panel A) and at 24 weeks 
(fifth secondary end point; Panel B) in time-to-event analyses in the pooled 
trial populations. Disability progression that was confirmed at 12 or 24 
weeks was defined as an increase from the baseline Expanded Disability 
Status Scale (EDSS) score (on a scale from 0 to 10.0, with higher scores 
 
indicating worse disability) of at least 1.0 point (or 0.5 points if the baseline 
EDSS score was >5.5) that was sustained for at least 12 or 24 weeks. The 
numbers shown on the curves represent Kaplan–Meier estimates of the 
risk of the event at week 96. The insets show the same data on an expand-
ed y axis.

Ocrelizumab vs. Interferon Beta-1a in Relapsing MS
and Fig. 2, and Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
The total mean numbers of new or newly en-
larged hyperintense lesions per T2-weighted MRI 
scan in the OPERA I trial was 0.32 with ocreliz-
umab versus 1.41 with interferon beta-1a (77% 
lower number of lesions with ocrelizumab, 
P<0.001). The values in the OPERA II trial were 
0.33 with ocrelizumab versus 1.90 with inter-
feron beta-1a (83% lower number of lesions with 
ocrelizumab, P<0.001) (Table 2, and Figs. S8 and 
S13 in the Supplementary Appendix). Most of the 
new or newly enlarged lesion activity on T2-weight-
ed MRI in the ocrelizumab groups occurred be-
tween baseline and week 24 (Fig. S8 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). From week 24 to week 48, 
the number of lesions was 94% lower in the 
ocrelizumab group than in the interferon beta-
1a group in the OPERA I trial and 96% lower in 
the ocrelizumab group than in the interferon beta-
1a group in the OPERA II trial. From week 48 to 
week 96 the number of lesions was 98% lower 
and 97% lower in the ocrelizumab group than in 
the interferon beta-1a group in the OPERA I 
trial and the OPERA II trial, respectively.
The total mean number of new hypointense 
lesions on T1-weighted MRI in the OPERA I trial 
was 0.42 with ocrelizumab versus 0.98 with inter-
feron beta-1a (57% lower number of lesions with 
ocrelizumab, P<0.001). The values in the OPERA II 
trial were 0.45 with ocrelizumab versus 1.26 with 
interferon beta-1a (64% lower number of lesions 
with ocrelizumab, P<0.001) (Table 2, and Fig. S9 
in the Supplementary Appendix). As a result of 
the failure in the statistical hierarchical testing, 
the differences in the percentage of brain-vol-
ume loss from week 24 to week 96 between the 
ocrelizumab group and the interferon beta-1a 
group were nonconfirmatory in the OPERA I trial 
(nominal P 
= 
0.004) and nonsignificant in the 
OPERA II trial (nominal P 
= 
0.09) (Table 2, and 
Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety
Adverse Events
A total of 327 of 408 patients (80.1%) in the ocre-
lizumab group reported an adverse event in the 
OPERA I trial, as compared with 331 of 409 
(80.9%) in the interferon beta-1a group; the cor-
responding values in the OPERA II trial were 360 
of 417 patients (86.3%) and 357 of 417 (85.6%) 
(Table 3). The most common adverse events were 
infusion-related reaction, nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection, headache, and urinary 
tract infection in patients treated with ocreliz-
umab and influenza-like illness, injection-site 
erythema, headache, urinary tract infection, and 
upper respiratory tract infection in patients treat-
ed with interferon beta-1a.
Serious adverse events were reported in 6.9% 
of the patients treated with ocrelizumab and in 
7.8% of those treated with interferon beta-1a in 
the OPERA I trial and in 7.0% of the patients 
treated with ocrelizumab and in 9.6% of those 
treated with interferon beta-1a in the OPERA II 
trial (Table 3). Three deaths occurred, including 
one death in the ocrelizumab group (suicide in 
the OPERA II trial) and two in the interferon 
beta-1a group (one suicide in the OPERA I trial, 
and one death due to mechanical ileus in the 
OPERA II trial).
Infections
Infection was reported in 232 patients (56.9%) in 
the ocrelizumab group and in 222 (54.3%) in the 
interferon beta-1a group in the OPERA I trial; 
the corresponding values in the OPERA II trial 
were 251 (60.2%) and 219 (52.5%) (Table 3). The 
most common infections (reported in ≥10% of the 
patients in either group across both trials) were 
upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngi-
tis, and urinary tract infection. There were more 
reports in the ocrelizumab group than in the 
interferon beta-1a group of upper respiratory tract 
infection (15.2% vs. 10.5%) and nasopharyngitis 
(14.8% vs. 10.2%), whereas urinary tract infec-
tion was more frequent in the interferon beta-1a 
group (11.6% vs. 12.1%). The overall percentage 
of patients reporting a serious infection was 1.3% 
in the ocrelizumab group and 2.9% in the inter-
feron beta-1a group (Table S5 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). The same pattern was seen when 
we used a broader definition of serious infection, 
including nonserious infection treated with an 
intravenous antiinfective treatment (1.8% in the 
ocrelizumab group vs. 3.8% in the interferon 
beta-1a group). No opportunistic infections were 
reported in any group over the duration of ei-
ther trial.
Across the two trials, the percentage of pa-
tients reporting herpesvirus-associated infection 
was 5.9% in the ocrelizumab group and 3.4% in 
the interferon beta-1a group (Tables S3 and S4 
in the Supplementary Appendix). All these events

were mild or moderate (Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events grade 1 or 2, as defined 
in Supplementary Appendix), with one exception: 
in the OPERA I trial, a patient treated with ocreliz-
umab for 1.6 years was hospitalized for a severe 
genital herpes simplex infection, which resolved 
with treatment.
Infusion-Related Reactions
More patients in the ocrelizumab group (34.3%) 
than in the interferon beta-1a group (9.7%) had 
at least one infusion-related reaction. Patients in 
the interferon beta-1a group received placebo infu-
sions. In the OPERA I trial, at least one infusion-
related reaction occurred in 30.9% of the patients 
in the ocrelizumab group and in 7.3% of those in 
the interferon beta-1a group; the corresponding 
values in the OPERA II trial were 37.6% and 
12.0%. Most infusion-related reactions were mild 
to moderate, were reported at the first infusion of 
dose 1 (Fig. S11 in the Supplementary Appendix), 
and were managed with infusion adjustments and 
treatment of symptoms. One patient in the ocre-
lizumab group in the OPERA I trial had a life-
threatening episode of bronchospasm during the 
first infusion of dose 1; the patient declined hos-
pitalization, recovered with treatment, and was 
withdrawn from the trial according to the proto-
col. The most frequent symptoms of infusion-
related reaction with ocrelizumab included pruri-
tus, rash, throat irritation, and flushing.
Laboratory Assessments
CD19+ cells represent a measure of B-cell counts 
in anti-CD20–treated patients. The level of CD19+ 
cells decreased to negligible levels with ocreliz-
umab treatment by week 2. (See the Additional 
Methodology Details section and Fig. S12 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.)
Antidrug-binding antibodies developed in 3 of 
825 patients (0.4%) who received ocrelizumab 
across the two trials, with neutralizing antibod-
ies developing in 1 patient in the OPERA II trial. 
Across the two trials, neutralizing anti–interferon 
beta-1a antibodies were detected in 21.3% of the 
patients.
Neoplasms
Across these two 96-week trials, four neoplasms 
(in 0.5% of patients) occurred in the ocrelizu-
Figure 2. MRI End Point.
Shown are the mean numbers of gadolinium-enhancing lesions per T1-weighted MRI scan by week 96 (second sec-
ondary end point). The number of lesions was divided by the total number of MRI scans of the brain by week 96.  
In the OPERA I trial, the number of lesions on the MRI scan at 96 weeks was 94% lower in the ocrelizumab group 
than in the interferon beta-1a group; in the OPERA II trial, the number of lesions was 95% lower in the ocrelizumab 
group than in the interferon beta-1a group. Adjusted P values are shown.

curred (in 0.2%) in the interferon beta-1a group 
(one case of mantle-cell lymphoma and one case 
of squamous-cell carcinoma in the chest) (Ta-
ble 3). Between the clinical cutoff dates of the 
two trials (April 2, 2015, in the OPERA I trial and 
May 12, 2015, in the OPERA II trial) and June 30, 
2016, five additional cases of neoplasm (two cases 
of breast cancer, two cases of basal-cell skin carci-
noma, and one case of malignant melanoma) 
were detected during the open-label extension 
study, during which all the patients received 
ocrelizumab. As of June 30, 2016, the overall 
incidence rate of first neoplasm among patients 
treated with ocrelizumab across all studies in-
volving patients with multiple sclerosis was 0.40 
per 100 patient-years of exposure to ocrelizumab 
(6467 patient-years of exposure), as compared 
with 0.20 per 100 patient-years of exposure in the 
pooled comparator groups (2053 patient-years of 
exposure in groups receiving interferon beta-1a 
or placebo). (See Table S6 in the Supplementary

Discussion
In the OPERA I and OPERA II trials, ocrelizumab 
was associated with significantly lower annualized 
relapse rates (the primary end point) than the ac-
tive comparator, interferon beta-1a, during the 
96-week treatment period. In addition, patients 
receiving ocrelizumab had better outcomes, as 
assessed in the first 6 of 10 secondary end points 
in the hierarchical testing. Ocrelizumab was as-
sociated with a lower rate of disability progression 
confirmed at 12 weeks and at 24 weeks than in-
terferon beta-1a, both in the prespecified pooled 
analysis and in each of the two phase 3 trials 
separately. Ocrelizumab also was associated with 
a higher rate of disability improvement confirmed 
at 12 weeks (a secondary end point) than inter-
feron beta-1a in the pooled analysis.
These findings were supported by a signifi-
cantly greater suppression of development of new 
areas of inflammation (as assessed by means of 
MRI of the brain with the use of gadolinium en-
hancement) and new or newly enlarged plaque 
formation (as measured by lesions on T2-weight-
ed MRI) (Figs. S7 and S8 in Supplementary Ap-
pendix). However, the change in Multiple Sclero-
sis 
Functional 
Composite 
score, 
whole 
brain-volume 
loss, and the change in the SF-36 physical-com-
ponent summary score were significantly better 
with ocrelizumab than with interferon beta-1a 
in one trial but not in the other. Although the 
findings were nonconfirmatory as a result of 
failure of the hierarchical analysis, the percent-
ages of patients who had no evidence of disease 
activity were higher with ocrelizumab than with 
interferon beta-1a in the two trials.
Infusion-related reactions were more com-
mon in patients treated with ocrelizumab than 
in those treated with interferon beta-1a and in-
cluded one life-threatening (grade 4) broncho-
spasm. The most likely mechanism for an infu-
sion-related reaction is a type 2 hypersensitivity 
reaction, in which cytokines are released from 
an effector cell after the ligation of low-affinity 
Fc receptors by ocrelizumab-opsonized B cells.25 
The incidence and severity of infusion-related reac-
tions decreased over the administration of subse-
quent doses; however, such reactions could occur 
at any infusion. The limited immunogenicity of 
ocrelizumab was shown by the low incidence of 
antidrug antibodies among patients treated with 
ocrelizumab; the incidence of neutralizing anti-
bodies with interferon beta-1a was consistent 
with historical data.26,27
The traditional view of the pathophysiology 
of multiple sclerosis is that it is predominantly a 
T-cell–mediated disease. The findings in our two 
trials are consistent with evidence that B cells 
play a role in the pathogenesis of multiple scle-
rosis.28,29 The mechanism of action of ocrelizu-
mab involves immunomodulation by means of the 
reduction in the number and function of CD20+ 
B cells.30,31 The trafficking of activated oligoclonal 
populations of B cells between the central ner-
vous system and peripheral circulation has been 
observed in persons with relapsing multiple 
sclerosis,32,33 and the disruption of this network 
may explain the effects of ocrelizumab in our 
trials. Lymphoid stem cells and plasma cells lack 
CD20, and thus B-cell reconstitution and preex-
isting humoral immunity should be relatively 
preserved with ocrelizumab treatment.26,27,34
The numerical imbalance in the neoplasms ob-
served in the OPERA I trial and in the ORATORIO 
trial,24 which involved patients with primary 
progressive multiple sclerosis, warrants ongoing 
evaluation in the context of the epidemiology of 
neoplasm in the population of patients with 
multiple sclerosis and long-term experience with 
ocrelizumab and other anti-CD20 treatments.35-37 
No cases of progressive multifocal leukoencepha-
lopathy (PML) have been reported so far with 
ocrelizumab across all clinical studies (F. Hoff-
man–La Roche data on file). Further long-term 
assessment of the safety profile of ocrelizumab 
is required in order to fully characterize the risk 
of uncommon adverse events, including PML.
Inflammation and neurodegeneration are un-
derstood to be two distinct but overlapping mecha-
nisms of the pathogenesis of multiple sclero-
sis,38,39 with inflammation dominating the early 
stages of disease.40 The use of current therapies 
in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis has 
been associated with an improved overall prog-
nosis, as compared with the pretreatment era. 
However, most treated patients still have wors-
ening neurologic disability over time in this life-
long disease.3,41-43 Additional and extended studies 
will be required in order to determine whether 
the outcomes observed in these 96-week trials, 
including a near-complete cessation of new plaque
