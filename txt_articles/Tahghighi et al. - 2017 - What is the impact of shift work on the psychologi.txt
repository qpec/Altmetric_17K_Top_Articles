ABSTRACT 
Aim. To synthesise existing research to determine if nurses who work shifts have poorer 
psychological functioning and resilience than nurses who do not work shifts. 
Background. Research exploring the impact of shift work on the psychological functioning 
and resilience of nurses is limited compared to research investigating the impact of shifts on 
physical outcomes.  
Design. Integrative literature review 
Data Sources. Relevant databases were searched from January 1995-August 2016 using the 
combination of keywords: nurse, shift work, rotating roster, night shift, resilient, hardiness, 
coping, wellbeing, burnout, mental health, occupational stress, compassion fatigue, 
compassion satisfaction, stress, anxiety, depression. 
Review Methods. Two authors independently performed integrative review processes 
proposed by Whittemore and Knafl and a quality assessment using the Mixed Methods 
Appraisal Tool by Pluye et al.  
Results. A total of 37 articles were included in the review (32 quantitative, 4 qualitative, 1 
mixed methods). Approximately half of the studies directly compared nurse shift workers 
with non-shift workers. Findings were grouped according to the following main outcomes: 1) 
General Psychological Wellbeing/Quality of Life, 2) Job satisfaction/Burnout, 3) Depression, 
Anxiety and Stress, and 4) Resilience/Coping. We did not find definitive evidence that shift 
work is associated with poorer psychological functioning in nurses. Overall, the findings 
suggest that the impact of shift work on nurse psychological functioning is dependent on a 
number of contextual and individual factors.

Conclusion. More studies are required which directly compare the psychological outcomes 
and resilience of nurse shift workers with non-shift workers.  
Keywords: nursing, shift work, compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, anxiety, stress, 
depression, psychological outcomes, burnout, wellbeing, resilience 
SUMMARY STATEMENT: 
- Why is this research or review needed? 
 Shift work is necessary in nursing but it may affect nurses’ physical and mental health 
and their ability to provide high quality patient care 
 There is currently little knowledge regarding the specific impact of working shifts on 
nurse psychological functioning and resilience. 
 This information is needed to assist nurse managers and policy makers regarding 
potential strategies to mitigate the risk associated with shift work. 
- What are the key findings? 
 A few studies reported negative psychological outcomes associated with shift work 
while other studies did not find evidence of negative psychological impacts. 
 The studies have used many different/inconsistent outcome measures. Only 
approximately half of the studies directly compared nurse shift workers with                        
non-shift worker counterparts. 
 There is a need for more investigation to directly compare nurse shift workers with 
non-shift workers, while considering different contextual (e.g. work setting) and 
individual factors (e.g. level of resilience). 
- How should the findings be used to influence policy/practice/research/education?

 More research is needed to clarify the association between specific variables 
associated with poor response to shift work  
 Understanding these variables can assist managers/policy makers to support nurse 
shift workers in order to prevent possible negative psychological outcomes. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
The International Council of Nurses acknowledged in 2007 that shift work is necessary in the 
nursing profession; however, there is also significant concern about the negative impact of 
working shifts on nurses’ physical and mental health, and their ability to provide  high quality 
patient care (International Council of Nurses, 2007). Nurse shift workers not only have to 
cope with the effects of shift work on family life (West et al., 2009), but also its effects on 
social and leisure activities (Faseleh et al., 2013). Work and family commitments usually 
cannot be fulfilled simultaneously. Therefore, working shifts commonly conflicts with valued 
time for family activities as well as restricting domestic commitments, particularly for female 
shift workers who may also be responsible for child-rearing or other caring roles (Hsu and 
Kernohan, 2006, West et al., 2009). Internationally, it is predicted that there will be a shortage 
of nurses by 2025 (Health Workforce Australia 2025, 2012). Understanding the factors that 
impact upon nurse retention is therefore critical. Nursing is well-recognised as a stressful 
occupation and a large body of research has investigated the impact of nursing on 
psychological functioning (Cameron and Brownie, 2010, Manzano García and Carlos, 2012, 
Mealer et al., 2012, McDonald et al., 2013). However, far less work has been conducted that 
focuses exclusively on understanding the impact of shift work on psychological outcomes. 
BACKGROUND

RESILIENCE, MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING IN NURSES WORKING SHIFT 
WORK                                                                                                                                         
Nurses are continually exposed to both acute and chronic workplace stressors which can lead 
to the development of psychological syndromes and disorders such as depression, anxiety, 
anger, irritability and burnout (Israel et al., 1989, Mealer et al., 2012). Many factors are 
known to contribute to this stress such as workload, hours worked, work environment, 
relationships between co-workers, ineffective management, patients/clients and their families, 
doubts about treatment, coping with death, lack of preparation time, discrimination and shift 
work (Colligan and Higgins, 2006, McVicar, 2003, Ma et al., 2014). These psychological and 
physical factors have been linked to decreased job satisfaction and retention problems among 
nurses (Donley, 2005, Letvak and Buck, 2008).  
The adverse effects of occupational stressors on nurses with respect to nurse turnover, 
productivity, costs and the effect on quality of care are well known (Donley, 2005, Letvak 
and Buck, 2008). In light of these effects, governments have enacted various strategies to 
alleviate the global shortage of qualified nurses (Nevidjon and Erickson, 2001). In the US and 
Australia, these strategies have included assisting nurses with the cost of their pre-registration 
qualification by providing government subsidies (Commonwealth of Australia, 2012), 
increasing the recruitment of nursing students into programs by providing funding to 
educational institutions (American Association of Colleges of Nursing, 2015), and proposing 
task substitution, which is defined as allocating clinical responsibilities to lesser trained health 
professionals with or without supervision (Buchan and Dal Poz, 2002, Yong, 2006). 
However, while attracting more people into nursing programs is important, so too is retaining 
nurses within their current positions (Health Workforce Australia 2025, 2012). An important 
factor in the retention of nurses in the workforce is job satisfaction and this includes an 
understanding of the maintenance of both the psychological and physical wellbeing of nurses. 
Therefore, it is essential to clearly understand how nurses cope with work related stressors in 
the health care environment of the 21st Century and how they can maintain a healthier

WORK                                                                                                                                         
psychological profile and be resilient in the work environment. There is some evidence 
indicating that the majority of nurses who face work related stress have a higher intention to 
resign from their position or reduce their working hours (Maville and Huerta, 2013, Tei-
Tominaga, 2013), which has an economic cost to their employers and the health care system 
(Mealer et al., 2012). It has been suggested however, that nurses who are resilient show 
successful adaptation and an active coping style in response to stressors, and are therefore 
more likely to remain in the workforce for longer (Charney, 2004, Grafton et al., 2010, 
Turner, 2014). 
Resilience is defined as a learnable, multidimensional ability of a person which enables him 
or her to function at a high level when facing an acute or chronic threat to their wellbeing 
(Rutter, 1987). Several studies have explored the link between nurse resilience and 
psychological outcomes such as stress, anxiety, depression, compassion fatigue and 
compassion satisfaction (Glasberg et al., 2007, Jackson et al., 2007, Ma et al., 2009, Gillespie 
et al., 2009, Cameron and Brownie, 2010, Gustafsson et al., 2010, Grafton et al., 2010, Matos 
et al., 2010, Kornhaber and Wilson, 2011, Manzano García and Carlos, 2012, Mealer et al., 
2012, Sawatzky and Enns, 2012, Hegney et al., 2014, Hinderer et al., 2014). However, far 
less work has been conducted regarding these variables as they relate specifically to nurses 
who work shifts. As such, there is currently very little understanding of the impact of shift 
work on the resilience and psychological wellbeing of nurses. Concerns about nursing 
shortages and retention, and previous studies into job satisfaction in the nursing workforce 
(Eley et al., 2007, Eley et al., 2010, Tuckett et al., 2011), highlight the need to investigate 
how shift work may influence nurse resilience and related psychological functioning.

RESILIENCE, MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING IN NURSES WORKING SHIFT 
WORK                                                                                                                                         
The aim of this integrative review was to synthesise and evaluate the evidence regarding the 
impact of shift work on the psychological functioning and resilience of nurses. Specifically, 
this review addressed the following question: 
Do nurses who work shifts have poorer psychological functioning and lower resilience than 
nurses who do not work shifts? 
Addressing this question will provide evidence that may be useful to assist policy makers to 
better understand the risk profile of their shift workers and manage the risk associated with 
shift work.    
Design 
An integrative review of the literature was undertaken, adhering to the reporting guidelines 
for mixed studies reviews (Whittemore and Knafl, 2005). The Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist was followed (Moher et al., 
2009). The review is registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic 
Reviews (PROSPERO) (Number CRD42015017369).  
Search methods 
This review included articles related to the impact of shift work on the psychological 
functioning and resilience of nurses. Articles that focused solely on the physical outcomes of 
shift work on nurses were excluded due to the presence of recent reviews on this topic (Niu et 
al., 2011) and the impacts of shift work on nurses’ health (Matheson et al., 2014). Similarly, 
articles that focused on the relationship between nurse work hours/overtime and nurse and 
patient outcomes (Bae and Fabry, 2014) were excluded. The articles for this systematic 
review were identified by searching the following electronic databases: CINAHL plus, 
PubMed, Medline (Ovid), Embase and Google scholar, as well as grey literature such as 
Australian Nursing Federation, Queensland Nurses Union and Australian Health Practitioner

Regulation Agency. Articles published from January 1995 to August 2016 were included in 
this review. The search terms included variations of the following key words: nurs*, shift 
work, rotating roster, night shift*, resilien*, hardiness, cop*, wellbeing, burnout, mental 
health, occupational stress, compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, stress, anxiety, 
depression.  
Studies reporting on the psychological functioning and/or resilience of nurses were included, 
if the sample:  
a) comprised employed professional nurses (Registered or international equivalent), and 
b) worked any irregular and rotating shift schedule, including morning, evening, and night 
shifts, regardless of the day of the week that a nurse worked. This definition excludes nurses 
who permanently work only morning shifts (Australian Commonwealth Government, 2011).  
Studies that were not published in English, considered only midwives or included both nurses 
and midwives but did not report their data separately, or were published earlier than the year 
1995 were excluded. The former criterion was due to the difference between the scope of 
practice of nurses and midwives. The latter criterion was also due to the mid-1990s being 
considered pivotal in nurses’ professional education (Keogh, 1997, Bennett, Andersson, 
1999). Since 1984, Australian nurses, for the first time, were given the opportunity to have 
tertiary education, instead of traditional hospital based training (Smith, 1999). Following that, 
nurses universally were motivated to attain a university degree (Lusk et al., 2001). Having a 
lower educational qualification can be a risk factor for experiencing symptoms of burnout 
among nurses (Hegney et al., 2014). As a result of the difference between the two generations 
of nurses, and by virtue of the date limiters, the cohort of exclusively hospital trained nurses 
was excluded.

Search outcomes 
The initial search resulted in 275 articles of which 139 were excluded because they did not 
meet the inclusion criteria for this review.  The 136 articles were screened using their title for 
the presence of a study on nurses working shifts as defined and its association with 
psychological functioning and resilience. From those 136 articles, the abstracts of 15 articles 
were reviewed, as it was difficult to apply the inclusion criteria to their title. A total of 95 
articles were selected and underwent critical appraisal. Of these 95 articles, 58 were excluded, 
as: they were primarily concerned with the physical impact of shift work (20 articles), did not 
measure shift work (3 articles), were not conducted among shift worker nurses (29 articles), 
were  review articles (2 articles), and did not include employed nurses (4 articles). Figure 1 
provides the PRISMA diagram related to this integrative review. 
Quality appraisal 
Two authors (M.T., C.R.) independently reviewed the quality of the 37 studies using an 
assessing system for mixed methods research and mixed studies reviews (SMSR) (Pluye et 
al., 2009). The detailed breakdown of each reviewer’s scores is presented in supplementary 
materials. [See supplementary Tables 5-7]. For each criterion, the presence/absence of the 
criterion was scored 1 and 0, respectively. Quantitative observational studies were assessed 
according to their appropriate sampling (n>100 considered as appropriate), justification of 
measurements, and control of confounders. Qualitative studies were evaluated for appropriate 
qualitative objective and method, description of the context, participants, and justification of 
participant selection, as well as description of qualitative data collection and analysis, and 
researcher reflexivity. The mixed method study was assessed for justification of the mixed 
methods design, combination of qualitative and quantitative data collection-analysis 
techniques, and integration of qualitative and quantitative results. There were minimal 
subjective differences regarding assessment of the articles which was discussed by the

WORK                                                                                                                                         
authors to reach an agreement. The comparison of the two sets of quality assessments 
demonstrated a substantial degree of agreement between coders; Cohen’s kappa= 0.75, 
indicating a good reliability (Cohen, 1960). Overall, the studies included in this review 
received moderate to high quality ratings.  
Data extraction and synthesis 
To assist with the synthesis of studies the same two authors (MT, CR) independently grouped 
the studies according to the main outcome variables they reported, namely; 1) General 
Psychological Wellbeing/Quality of Life, 2) Job satisfaction/Burnout, 3) Depression, Anxiety 
and Stress, and 4) Resilience/Coping. There were no discrepancies between authors as to the 
grouping of the articles into these four categories. Further, each study was classified 
according to whether it directly compared shift workers with non-shift workers (Category A 
studies) or if it only compared or examined relationships between variables among different 
types of shift workers (Category B studies). A similar synthesis was conducted for qualitative 
studies by examining the themes identified in each of the studies and grouping them 
according to the main outcome variables of this review. The synthesis of the final 37 
qualitative and quantitative studies was then combined and the data were extracted and 
inserted into a four separate tables according to the main outcome variable: study setting, 
design, sample, measures, and analytical methods [see Tables 1-4]. Additional key findings of 
the studies were included in additional tables [see supplementary Table 8-11]. Figure 2 
illustrates the method used for synthesising articles.

WORK                                                                                                                                         
Of the final 37 studies included in this review, 32 were quantitative, 4 were qualitative and 
one was a mixed-methods study.  Overall, 5 of the articles used a longitudinal study design, 
and the remainder used a cross sectional study design. Ten articles reported gender-specific 
results considering only female nurses. The quality of studies was excellent with 76% 
receiving a rating of 100%. The samples sizes ranged from 13 to 25924 and the majority of 
studies were conducted in Europe (n=12, 32.43%), followed by Asia (n=11, 29.73%), 
Australia/NZ (n= 6, 16.22%), the U.S/Canada (n=4, 10.81%), and the Middle East (n=4, 
10.81%).  
Outcomes 
General Psychological Wellbeing/Quality of Life: This outcome category broadly captures 
overall psychological functioning in terms of wellbeing and quality of life. Three qualitative 
studies (West et al., 2009, Powell, 2013, Faseleh et al., 2013) and five quantitative studies 
(Camerino et al., 2010, Estryn-Béhar and Beatrice, 2012, Šimunić and Gregov, 2012, Lin et 
al., 2012, Sorić et al., 2013) obtained information related to this outcome. The quantitative 
measures included: a single item measure of wellbeing (Estryn-Béhar and Beatrice, 2012), the 
Scale of the Negative Effects of Work Time (Ahasan et al., 2002), Conflict Between Work 
and Family Rating Scale (Netemeyer et al., 1996), Chinese Health Questionnaire 12-item 
(Cheng and Williams, 1986) and the World Health Organisation Quality of Life 
Questionnaire brief version (WHOQOL-BREF)  (World Health Organisation, 1996). 
The qualitative studies by West et al. (2009) and Faseleh et al. (2013) both found themes 
relating to family disruption and stress associated with working shifts. Nurses reported having 
to restructure their lives to minimise disruption to family. The qualitative study by Powell 
(2013) with 14 nurses found that shift work was associated with fatigue and a sense of 
isolation. In terms of quantitative studies, Sorić et al. (2013) compared the quality of life of 
 12

WORK                                                                                                                                         
shift workers and non-shift workers using the WHOQOL-BREF and found shift workers had 
poorer quality of life scores than non-shift workers. A number of studies compared wellbeing 
and quality of life scores across different patterns of shifts. Estryn-Béhar and Beatrice (2012) 
found on a single item measure of wellbeing, that one-third of nurses working 12hr days, 
nurses working 10hr night shifts and nurses working alternating shifts, reported 
dissatisfaction with work time and low wellbeing. Nurses working part time and 12hr day 
shifts or 8hr night shifts had less work/family conflict. Šimunić and Gregov (2012) used the 
Conflict between Work and Family Rating Scale and Scale of the Negative Effects of Work 
time and found less conflict between work and family among nurses working only morning 
shifts than those who worked forward rotation 12hr, 8hr, and backward rotation and irregular 
8hr shifts. Similarly, Lin et al. (2012) found rotating shifts were associated with worse 
general mental health compared to day shifts.  
The current evidence suggests that shift work is associated with poor quality of life and low 
psychological wellbeing among nurses but that this is dependent on the type of shifts worked 
and other circumstances such as whether the nurse works full or part-time. Only five study in 
this group directly compared outcomes for nurses working shifts against nurses not working 
shifts, more of these direct comparisons are required to strengthen the findings regarding the 
impact of shift work on quality of life and wellbeing. Overall, the methodological quality of 
these studies was 93.75 with four out of five quantitative studies also providing information 
on the precision of their findings. [See estimate of percision supplementary Table 12].  
Job Satisfaction/Burnout: This outcome category captures psychological functioning 
specifically as it relates to perception of the work environment. The measures used to assess 
job satisfaction and burnout included: the Hoppock Scale 5-item General Job Satisfaction 
Scale (Nichols et al., 1978); the 6-item job satisfaction scale (Agho et al., 1992), the

WORK                                                                                                                                         
Job/Work  Environment Nursing  Satisfaction  Survey (Halfer and Graf, 2006), the Standard 
Shift Work Index Questionnaire (Barton J et al., 1995), semantic differential items for 
measuring job, family, and life satisfaction (Gregov, 1994), Index of Work Satisfaction 
(Stamps, 1997), and for burnout, the 22-item Maslach Burnout Inventory (Maslach and 
Jackson, 1981), Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (Kristensen et al., 2005), and the 27-item job 
stress questionnaire from the Korean Occupational Stress Scale (Chang et al., 2005). 
Wisetborisut et al. (2014) found burnout scores were higher in shift workers compared to 
non-shift workers. In this study, shift workers who had 6-8 sleeping hours per day and at least 
8 days off per month had fewer burnout symptoms. Shahriari et al. (2014) found higher levels 
of burnout in fixed compared to rotating shift workers and this finding was irrespective of 
whether the shifts were morning or night. In contrast, Jamal and Baba (1997) found no 
difference between nurses working various shifts on burnout but found that nurses working 
night shifts had lower ratings of job satisfaction than their non-night shift counterparts. 
However, this finding was not supported in two other studies that found no difference 
between shift types on job satisfaction (Hoffman and Scott, 2003, Ruggiero, 2005). Ha (2015) 
used Q Methodology with 39 nurses working rotating shifts and found three main findings; 1) 
Working rotating shifts is frustrating, 2) Working rotating shifts is satisfactory, and 3) 
Working rotating shifts is problematic but necessary. In a longitudinal study by Cheng et al. 
(2015) nurses who worked 12 hour shifts reported significantly higher job satisfaction than 
nurses working 8 hour shifts. In contrast, Šimunić and Gregov (2012) found 12 hour shifts to 
be associated with lower cognitive-affective job satisfaction compared to nurses working 
morning shifts. Teclaw and Osatuke (2014) found that overall job satisfaction was lower in 
off-shift workers (eg: evening and night shifts) compared to day workers. A recent study by 
Rodwell and Fernando (2016) found that shift work alone was not associated with lower job

satisfaction but that job satisfaction was most dependent on work context and other lifestyle 
factors as opposed to just shift type.  
Only five studies in this category directly compared shift workers with non-shift workers and 
found higher rates of burnout in the shift-working group. The majority of the studies 
compared various types of shift work and found mixed results regarding the impact on job 
satisfaction and burnout. Overall, the methodological quality of these studies was 84.90 with 
only three of them providing information on the precision of their findings. [See estimate of 
percision supplementary Table 12]. 
Depression, Anxiety and Stress: This outcome captures the effect of shift work on 
psychological states such as depression, anxiety and stress. The measures used to assess these 
variables included: The Nursing Stress Scale (Gray-Toft and Anderson, 1981), Beck 
Depression Inventory-II (Beck et al., 1996), Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression 
Scale (Radloff, 1977); Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (Kroenke and Spitzer, 2002), Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983), Taiwan Nurse Stress Checklist 
(Tsai and Crockett, 1993). State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 1983), Profile of  
Mood States (McNair et al., 1971), 12-item version of the General Health Questionnaire 
(Iwata et al., 1988, Goldberg, 1972).  
The study by Hea Young et al. (2015) found that nurses who worked shifts had higher odds 
of increased severity of depressive symptoms than those nurses who did not work shifts. In a 
prospective longitudinal study, Berthelsen et al. (2015) examined the impact of different shift 
types on depression and found that night shifts and rotating shifts were not associated with 
increased chances of ‘caseness’ of anxiety or depression after 12 months of follow-up. This 
result was supported by Ruggiero (2005) who found no difference between shift type and 
level of depression. A correlational study by Jung and Lee (2015) found that nurse shift

WORK                                                                                                                                         
workers, who had high levels of alertness early in the day (high levels of morningness) and 
were younger in age, had lower levels of depression. Morningness-eveningness reflects ones’ 
diurnal preferences, those who have high scores on morningness have their peak of alertness 
earlier in the day compared to those with low scores (Roberts and Kyllonen, 1999).  
In another longitudinal study, Saksvik-Lehouillier et al. (2012) found the relationship 
between shift work tolerance and depression was best explained by level of nurse hardiness. 
Hardiness is a general resilience factor influencing how one copes with stress and illness 
(Storemark et al., 2013). The ability to work shifts without experiencing any negative 
consequences is referred to as “Shift Work Tolerance” (Andlauer et al., 1978). Similarly, 
Natvik et al. (2011) used regression analysis to determine predictors of depression in nurse 
shift workers and concluded that the impact of shift work is complex and interrelated with 
other factors such as morningness, languidity and hardiness.  
In terms of stress and anxiety, Faseleh et al. (2013)interviewed night shift workers who 
reported being highly stressed at work. Lin et al. (2014) did not find a difference in job stress 
according to the type of shift worked , but in a later study by the same authors they found that 
rotating shifts were associated with effort-reward imbalance (Lin et al., 2015). In the study by 
Hoffman and Scott (2003) nurses working 12 hour shifts reported greater levels of stress than 
those working 8 hour shifts. However, in direct contrast to this study, Cheng et al. (2015) 
found nurses working 12 hour shifts reported less job stress than nurses working 8 hour shifts. 
One study found fixed shift nurses had higher anxiety and social dysfunction compared to 
rotating shift nurses (Ardekani et al., 2008). Korompeli et al. (2014) utilised the Standard 
Shift Work Index and found female nurses working rotating shifts had higher cognitive and 
somatic anxiety compared to their morning shift counterparts. Finally, the study by Samaha et 
al. (2007) found anxiety was associated with chronic fatigue in shift workers.

WORK                                                                                                                                         
A methodological strength of the studies conducted in this category is that two were 
longitudinal in design, measuring nurse depression, anxiety and stress over time. However, 
these studies were conducted among nurse shift workers and so do not provide a direct 
comparison to non-shift workers. Only six studies compared shift workers with non-shift 
workers.  Among the studies investigating the impact of different types of shifts on 
depression, anxiety and stress, the findings are inconsistent. Overall, the methodological 
quality of these studies was 93.75 with three out of sixteen quantitative studies providing 
information on the precision of their findings. [See estimate of percision supplementary Table 
12]. 
Resilience and Coping: This outcome captures how well nurses are coping and their level of 
individual psychological resilience, both which are known to be strongly related to 
psychological wellbeing. Resilience and coping are closely related constructs and so were 
assessed together. The constructs were measured with the following scales: the 24-item 
coping questionnaire (Spelten et al., 1993), the Dispositional Resilience (Hardiness) Scale 
Revised (Hystad et al., 2010), the 15-item Short Hardiness Scale (Barton, 1995), and the 
Dispositional Resilience (Hardiness) Scale –Revised (Hystad et al., 2010). 
A mixed-method study by Clendon and Walker (2013) examined coping and shift work. They 
found single participants reported that shift work suited them; while it had a somewhat 
negative impact on their social and family relationships. Flexible working hours and the 
ability to do jobs during normal working hours were the positive aspects of shift work 
highlighted and participants who worked part time appeared to be coping better with shift 
work. Participants also used coping mechanisms to help manage the impact of shift work on 
their health, social and family functioning. These coping techniques included choosing 
lifestyle-friendly shifts, and allocating specific times for sleeping, eating and exercising. They

WORK                                                                                                                                         
recommended employers could assist with self-rostering and facilitate the work place to have 
a space for night shift workers to sleep prior to going home after night shifts (Clendon and 
Walker, 2013). Overall, they found that nurses had very different opinions about working 
shifts with some reporting negative aspects and others reporting that they have adapted to 
cope with shifts in a way that they found worked well. The study by Samaha et al. (2007) 
found that maladaptive coping (drinking alcohol, letting emotions out, and avoiding the 
situation) was associated with chronic fatigue in shift workers. Pisarski et al. (1998) found a 
complex relationship between coping and social support in shift workers with disengagement 
coping (a type of emotion-focused coping) being negatively associated with poorer mental 
health. Several studies have found that hardiness is associated with better tolerance to shift 
work (Saksvik-Lehouillier et al., 2012, Storemark et al., 2013, Saksvik-Lehouillier et al., 
2013, Saksvik-Lehouillier et al., 2016). This is consistent with the qualitative work of Powell 
(2013) who found that nurses reported relying on their own levels of resilience to overcome 
the stress and isolation associated with shift work. Overall, studies that directly investigated 
psychological resilience among nurse shift workers are limited. However, they show that both 
the use of coping strategies as well as individual level of resilience (hardiness) appears to play 
an important role in determining nurse psychological functioning in response to working 
shifts. Only three studies compared shift workers with non-shift workers. The methodological 
quality of these studies was 98.16with one out of seven quantitative studies providing 
information on the precision of their findings. [See estimate of percision supplementary Table

DISCUSSION 
This review synthesised and evaluated studies that investigated the impact of shift work on 
the psychological functioning and resilience of nurses. Specifically, we sought to answer the 
 18 
RESILIENCE, MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING IN NURSES WORKING SHIFT 
WORK                                                                                                                                         
question: Do nurses who work shifts have poorer psychological functioning and lower 
resilience than those who do not work shifts? The existing evidence indicates that there is 
currently no clear answer to this question. Whilst some studies did report negative 
psychological outcomes for nurses working shifts, this was not a consistent finding across all 
studies.  
Comparing the results of studies is also made more complex by the variety of different 
measures used to assess the various psychological outcomes. In addition, approximately half 
of the studies examined outcomes across different types of shifts as opposed to making clear 
comparisons between shift and non-shift workers. The vast majority of the studies are cross-
sectional and therefore a number of them only report significant associations between 
outcomes such as burnout and depression in shift workers. This limits conclusions as to 
causality of shift work on psychological outcomes.  
While recognising there are some inconsistences in the results, overall, the findings of this 
review suggest a number of negative psychological outcomes are associated with working 
shifts. Some of the studies revealed that shift work limited social life, and was associated with 
work/family conflict (Clendon and Walker, 2013, Faseleh et al., 2013), low levels of 
wellbeing (Estryn-Béhar and Beatrice, 2012), poor mental health (Lin et al., 2012), low levels 
of job satisfaction, high levels of burnout (Wisetborisut et al., 2014) and high rates of 
neuroticism (Korompeli et al., 2014).  
Despite these findings, this review highlights the critical importance of studying context when 
attempting to understand the impact of shift work on nurses. The current evidence suggests 
that shift work may not have the same negative impacts on all nurses but that how nurses 
respond to shift work is much dependent on other factors. Some of the factors that emerged in 
these studies included; how much sleep the nurse was getting, how many days off they had 
 19 
RESILIENCE, MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING IN NURSES WORKING SHIFT 
WORK                                                                                                                                         
per month, whether they worked part-time or full-time, the gender of the nurse, their level of 
morningness-eveningness and their level of resilience. Whilst resilience/hardiness was found 
to predict how well the nurses tolerated working shifts, it is surprising that only six studies 
used a resilience scale as their measurement tool to investigate the impact of shift work on 
nurse resilience (Natvik et al., 2011, Flo et al., 2012, Saksvik-Lehouillier et al., 2012, 
Storemark et al., 2013, Saksvik-Lehouillier et al., 2013, Saksvik-Lehouillier et al., 2016). 
There is a clear need for more longitudinal and between-groups studies in order to determine 
the impact of shift work on the psychological functioning and resilience of nurses. Overall, 
the methodological quality of the studies was excellent. However, only 33 % provided 
important information regarding the precision of the results in terms of confidence intervals. 
More consistent use of outcome measurement tools would facilitate the comparison of study 
outcomes. Additionally, given the importance of context, studies also need to be conducted 
among nurses working in a variety of nursing contexts, not only in acute hospitals but also in 
aged care facilities, home care and community settings. Such research that accounts for 
individual as well as contextual factors in determining nurses’ wellbeing (Cusack et al., 2016) 
is essential to understand how to build and maintain resilience in nurses who work shifts. The 
findings will inform policy makers in order to promote health in the workforce. This may lead 
to increased recruitment and retention of nurses alleviating the economic burden associated 
with shortage of nurses, and improve poor quality of patient care associated with higher rates 
of those negative psychological outcomes. 
CONCLUSION 
This integrative review aimed to critically evaluate the evidence regarding the impact of shift 
work on the psychological functioning and resilience of nurses. The majority of studies were 
correlational comparing different patterns of shift work schedules and utilised inconsistent

outcome measures. Based on the current evidence, we cannot definitively conclude that 
nurses who work shifts have poorer psychological functioning than those who do not. Instead, 
the current evidence suggests that for some nurses, shift work is associated with negative 
psychological outcomes and these outcomes appear highly dependent on contextual and 
individual factors. Moreover, to clearly understand the impact of shift work on nurse 
psychological functioning it is imperative that future studies employ more between-groups, 
longitudinal designs.
