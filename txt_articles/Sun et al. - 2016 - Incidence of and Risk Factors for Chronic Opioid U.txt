Incidence of and Risk Factors for Chronic Opioid Use Among
Opioid-Naive Patients in the Postoperative Period
Eric C. Sun, MD, PhD; Beth D. Darnall, PhD; Laurence C. Baker, PhD; Sean Mackey, MD, PhD
IMPORTANCE Chronic opioid use imposes a substantial burden in terms of morbidity and
economic costs. Whether opioid-naive patients undergoing surgery are at increased risk for
chronic opioid use is unknown, as are the potential risk factors for chronic opioid use
following surgery.
OBJECTIVE To characterize the risk of chronic opioid use among opioid-naive patients
following 1 of 11 surgical procedures compared with nonsurgical patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective analysis of administrative health claims to
determine the association between chronic opioid use and surgery among privately insured
patients between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2013. The data concluded 11 surgical
procedures (total knee arthroplasty [TKA], total hip arthroplasty, laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, open cholecystectomy, laparoscopic appendectomy, open appendectomy,
cesarean delivery, functional endoscopic sinus surgery [FESS], cataract surgery, transurethral
prostate resection [TURP], and simple mastectomy). Multivariable logistic regression analysis
was performed to control for possible confounders, including sex, age, preoperative history
of depression, psychosis, drug or alcohol abuse, and preoperatice use of benzodiazepines,
antipsychotics, and antidepressants.
EXPOSURES One of the 11 study surgical procedures.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Chronic opioid use, defined as having filled 10 or more
prescriptions or more than 120 days’supply of an opioid in the first year after surgery,
excluding the first 90 postoperative days. For nonsurgical patients, chronic opioid use was
defined as having filled 10 or more prescriptions or more than 120 days’supply following a
randomly assigned “surgery date.”
RESULTS The study included 641 941 opioid-naive surgical patients (169 666 men; mean [SD]
age, 44.0 [12.8] years), and 18 011 137 opioid-naive nonsurgical patients (8 849 107 men;
mean [SD] age, 42.4 [12.6] years). Among the surgical patients, the incidence of chronic
opioid in the first preoperative year ranged from 0.119% for Cesarean delivery (95% CI,
0.104%-0.134%) to 1.41% for TKA (95% CI, 1.29%-1.53%) The baseline incidence of chronic
opioid use among the nonsurgical patients was 0.136% (95% CI, 0.134%-0.137%). Except for
cataract surgery, laparoscopic appendectomy, FESS, and TURP, all of the surgical procedures
were associated with an increased risk of chronic opioid use, with odds ratios ranging from
1.28 (95% CI, 1.12-1.46) for cesarean delivery to 5.10 (95% CI, 4.67-5.58) for TKA. Male sex,
age older than 50 years, and preoperative history of drug abuse, alcohol abuse, depression,
benzodiazepine use, or antidepressant use were associated with chronic opioid use among
surgical patients.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In opioid-naive patients, many surgical procedures are
associated with an increased risk of chronic opioid use in the postoperative period. A certain
subset of patients (eg, men, elderly patients) may be particularly vulnerable.

I
n the United States, chronic opioid use continues to im-
pose a substantial burden in terms of morbidity and eco-
nomic costs.1 Opioid sales have increased sharply over the
past decade,2 particularly in the setting of noncancer pain,3,4
with a concomitant increase in opioid-related overdoses and
deaths.2,5 In an effort to reduce chronic opioid use, research-
ers have identified potential risk factors, such as substance use
disorders.6-8
Severalstudieshavealsosuggestedthatsurgeryisariskfac-
tor for chronic opioid use.9-11 For example, 1 study estimated a
3% incidence of prolonged opioid use following major elective
surgery,10 while the incidence of chronic neuropathic pain fol-
lowing total knee arthroplasty has been estimated to be as high
as 12.7% at 6 months.12 Most of these studies examined pro-
longed opioid use in the setting of surgical procedures per-
formed in patients with existing opioid use and surgical proce-
dures that are expected to result in substantial postoperative
pain. By contrast, the incidence and risk factors for chronic
opioid use among opioid-naive patients undergoing less pain-
ful procedures are not as well understood.
We used administrative health claims data to examine the
incidence of chronic opioid use within the first postsurgical
year among opioid-naive patients. We identified opioid-
naive patients undergoing 1 of 11 common procedures, includ-
ing several procedures not thought to produce long-term pain
(eg, functional endoscopic sinus surgery [FESS]). We then es-
timated the increased risk for chronic opioid use in the year
following surgery by comparing these patients with a refer-
ence group of nonsurgical patients. In addition, we tested for
several possible risk factors for chronic opioid use among sur-
gical patients, including age, sex, history of alcohol or drug
abuse, history of depression, and preoperative use of benzo-
diazepines, antipsychotics, and antidepressants.
Methods
Data
We obtained a sample of administrative health claims pro-
vided by MarketScan (Truven Health Analytics). MarketScan
provides person-level data on utilization and expenditures for
the care of people enrolled in private insurance plans through
a participating employer, health plan, or government organi-
zation. For more recent years, the database contains informa-
tion on the care of over 35 million beneficiaries; for earlier
years, claims from fewer patients are available. The data are
frequently used in analyses of health care utilization and
spending.13-16 Our data include all claims between January 1,
2001, and December 31, 2013. Because this study used deiden-
tifiedadministrativehealthclaimsdata,neitherinstitutionalre-
view board approval nor patient written informed consent was
required.
The inpatient and outpatient data claims data provide in-
formation from specific encounters, including diagnosis codes
(International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-
9]), procedure codes (Current Procedural Terminology [CPT]),
and date the service was provided. For the pharmacy claims
data, the information includes fill date, quantity supplied, and
number of days supplied. The data also provide the National
Drug Code, which can be linked to Red Book data (Truven
Health Analytics) to obtain the generic name and dose of the
prescribed drug.
Sample
We constructed a sample consisting of patients who under-
went 1 of 11 surgical procedures during the sample period: total
knee arthroplasty (TKA), total hip arthroplasty (THA), laparo-
scopic cholecystectomy, open cholecystectomy, laparo-
scopic appendectomy, open appendectomy, cesarean deliv-
ery, FESS, cataract surgery, transurethral prostate resection
(TURP), or simple mastectomy. We chose these procedures be-
cause they are commonly performed. In addition, with the ex-
ception of TKA and THA, these procedures are not indicated
to relieve pain and are not thought to place patients at risk for
long-term pain. We identified patients who underwent these
procedures by identifying inpatient or outpatient claims with
a CPT code for the given procedure (eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment).Werestrictedouranalysistopatientsaged18to64years
who were continuously enrolled for a period of at least 3 cal-
endar years, encompassing the year before the procedure and
theyearafter.Forexample,forpatientswhoreceivedtheirpro-
cedure in 2003, we required that the patient be continuously
enrolled for at least the time period January 1, 2002, through
December 31, 2004. In addition, we excluded patients who un-
derwent 2 or more of the 11 studied surgical procedures. Using
data from pharmacy claims, we further restricted our analy-
sis to opioid-naive patients, defined as patients who did not
fill a prescription for an opioid in the 12 months prior to their
procedure.Aflowchartoutliningtheconstructionofthesample
is provided in the eFigure in the Supplement.
Outcome Variables
Using pharmacy claims data, we isolated prescriptions for fen-
tanyl (patch or oral form), hydrocodone, hydromorphone (oral
form), methadone, morphine, oxymorphone, and oxyco-
done and excluded prescriptions containing hydrocodone in
cough/cold formulation. In addition, we excluded analgesic
preparations containing codeine, such as acetaminophen/
codeine combinations. Our outcome of interest was chronic
opioid use within the first postsurgical year. Previous studies
using administrative claims data have defined chronic opioid
use as having filled 10 or more prescriptions or more than 120
Key Points
Question Are opioid-naive patients undergoing surgery at
increased risk for chronic opioid use?
Findings This analysis of administrative health claims of 641 941
opioid-naive surgical patients and 18 011 137 opioid-naive
nonsurgical patients found that surgery was associated with an
increased risk of chronic opioid use among surgical patients.
Meaning Opioid-naive patients undergoing surgery are at an
increased risk for subsequent chronic opioid use, suggesting that
opioid use should be monitored closely in the postoperative
period.

days’supply within a 1-year period.11 Since some opioid use is
likely expected in the immediate postoperative period, we
slightly modified this definition to having filled 10 or more pre-
scriptions or more than 120 days’supply within the first year
after surgery, excluding the first 90 postoperative days (ie, we
measure only postoperative days 91-365).
Risk Factors for Chronic Opioid Use
Based on biological plausibility and the existing literature,10,17
weexaminedtheuseofbenzodiazepines,antidepressants,and
antipsychotics in the year prior to surgery as potential risk fac-
tors for chronic opioid use, by extracting all relevant prescrip-
tions from our pharmaceutical claims data; patients were clas-
sified as users of these medications if they filled at least 1
prescription in the year prior to surgery. A full list of the drugs
for each class is provided in eTable 2 in the Supplement. In ad-
dition,inlightofthefindingsreportedinpreviousliterature,6-8
we also examined whether age, sex, and a history of depres-
sion, alcohol abuse, or drug abuse served as risk factors for
chronic opioid use. Age and sex were obtained directly from
MarketScan. For depression, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse,
we used ICD-9 codes to identify patients with these diagno-
ses and the first year they received the diagnosis. Patients were
considered to have a preoperative history of depression, al-
cohol abuse, or drug abuse if they had at least 2 claims with
the relevant ICD-9 code prior to the year of their surgery. A list
of the ICD-9 codes we used can be found in eTable 3 in the
Supplement.
Other Covariates
The ICD-9 diagnosis codes were also used to control for co-
morbidities including diabetes mellitus, congestive heart fail-
ure, peripheral vascular disease, and hypertension. Similar to
thecriteriausedfordepression,alcoholabuse,anddrugabuse,
patients were considered to have a history for the given co-
morbidity if they filed at least 1 claim prior to the year of their
surgery. A full list of the comorbidities we considered is pro-
vided in Table 1, and the ICD-9 codes used to identify these
comorbidities is provided in the eTable 3 in the Supplement.
In addition, we also controlled for a patient’
s baseline use of
health services by obtaining the number of claims that were
submitted in the inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy set-
tings prior to surgery.
Reference Sample
To calculate the baseline incidence of chronic opioid use, we
alsocreatedareferencesampleofnonsurgicalpatients.Wecre-
ated this reference sample to measure the degree to which, at
the population level, patients typically transition into chronic
opioid use for nonsurgical reasons (eg, low back pain). Esti-
mating this baseline incidence allowed us to estimate the in-
creased risk in chronic opioid use associated with surgery.
To construct our reference sample, we began by identify-
ing patients aged 18 to 64 years who did not undergo any of the
11surgicalprocedures.Wethenrestrictedouranalysistopatients
who were continuously enrolled for at least 3 calendar years.
For each of these patients, we randomly assigned a false “sur-
gerydate”duringtheirsecondyearofenrollment.Similartoour
surgical patients, we isolated all prescriptions in the 1-year pe-
riod before the surgery date and restricted our analysis to per-
sons who did not fill any prescriptions for an opioid during that
1-yearperiod.Wethenmeasuredchronicopioiduseinthe1-year
periodfollowingthesurgerydateusingthesamemethodsused
for our surgical patients. Remaining covariates (eg, age, comor-
bidities) were also obtained using the same methods.
Statistical Analyses
Since the distribution of many of our covariates differs be-
tween our reference sample and our sample of surgical
patients (Table 1), a simple comparison of rates of chronic opi-
oid use was likely to be confounded. Therefore, we used a mul-
tivariable logistic regression to examine the correlation be-
tweensurgeryandchronicopioiduse.Weperformedaseparate
logisticregressionforeachprocedure,wherethesampleineach
regression consisted of the patients who underwent the given
procedureaswellasourreferencesample.Thedependentvari-
able in this regression was an indicator variable set at 1 if the
patient met the criteria for chronic opioid use and 0 other-
wise. The independent variable of interest was an indicator
variable for receiving the given type of surgery. Coefficients
for the surgery indicator variables captured the change in the
likelihood of chronic opioid use associated with each surgery
relative to nonsurgical patients. We included controls for the
preoperative use of benzodiazepines, antipsychotic medica-
tions, and antidepressants by generating indicator variables of
1 if a patient filled at least 1 prescription for the given class in
the preoperative year and 0 otherwise. We also included
controls for an extensive set of comorbidities, as listed in
Table 1. Finally, we included controls for age, sex, the year of
surgery, and the number of claims submitted in the inpatient,
outpatient, and pharmacy settings prior to surgery.
Toexaminetheeffectofourputativeriskfactorsonchronic
opioid use, we performed a separate multivariable logistic re-
gression among our sample of surgical patients only. Our base-
line analysis considered all surgical patients together; we also
performed separate analyses by procedure. In these regres-
sions, the dependent variables were indicator variables set at
1 if the patient met the definition for chronic opioid use in the
first postsurgical year and 0 otherwise. For this analysis, our
independent variables corresponded to putative risk factors:
age (modeled as an indicator variable for persons >50 years),
sex, preoperative pharmaceutical use (benzodiazepines,
antipsychotics, and antidepressants), and medical history
(alcohol abuse, drug abuse, depression, and psychosis). Our
analyses also included controls for the full set of comorbidi-
ties listed in Table 1. All of our analyses incorporated robust
standard errors (SEs) and were performed using Stata soft-
ware, version 14.0 (StataCorp LP).
Sensitivity Analysis
Ourbaselineanalysesincludedarobustsetofcovariatestocon-
trol for observable differences between our surgical and non-

assumed the presence of an unmeasured, binary confounder
thatwaspatientspecificandindependentofourmeasuredcon-
founders. We assumed that this confounder had a prevalence
of 50% among our surgical sample and 0% among the non-
surgical patients. Of note, the assumed difference in preva-
lence between surgical and nonsurgical patients of this un-
measured confounder is at least an order of magnitude larger
than the difference in prevalence for all of the medical comor-
bidities we examined. Using methods described elsewhere,19
we then estimated the degree of confounding that would be
necessary for this confounder to eliminate the estimated as-
sociation between surgery and chronic opioid use.

nonsurgicalpatientswereyounger(42.4vs44.0years;P < .001)
and more likely to be male (49.1% vs 26.4%; P < .001). Both
findings are consistent with the way our sample was drawn.
First, the prevalence of surgery increases with age. Second, for
2 of the surgical procedures we examined—mastectomy and
cesarean delivery—the population consisted of only female pa-
tients. Nonsurgical patients were also less likely to have used
antidepressants (11.8% vs 14.4%; P < .001), antipsychotics
(1.03% vs 1.45%; P < .001), and benzodiazepines (6.69% vs
9.90%; P < .001) preoperatively. In addition, the prevalence
of each of the comorbidities we examined was lower among
nonsurgical patients (Table 1), and overall health care utiliza-
tion (as measured by the total number of inpatient, outpa-
tient, and pharmacy claims in the preoperative period) was
lower among nonsurgical patients (Table 1). Summary statis-
tics broken down by individual procedure are listed in eTable
4 in the Supplement.
Figure 1 shows the incidence of chronic opioid use in the
first postoperative year, which ranged from 0.119% for cesar-
ean delivery (95% CI, 0.104%-0.134%) to 1.41% for TKA (95%
CI,1.29%-1.53%).Bycontrast,thebaselineincidenceofchronic
opioid use among nonsurgical patients was 0.136% (95% CI,
0.134%-0.137%). The incidence of chronic opioid use was sig-
nificantly higher for all of the procedures that we examined
(P < .001, χ2 test; eTable 5 in the Supplement) except for ce-
sarean delivery, where the incidence rate was significantly
lower (P = .04; eTable 5 in the Supplement), and laparoscopic
appendectomy, where there was no significant difference
(P = .15; eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Although Figure 1 suggests that most of the surgical pro-
cedures we examined were associated with a higher inci-
dence of chronic opioid use compared with nonsurgical con-
trols, the values shown are unadjusted for differences in the
surgical and nonsurgical population detailed in Table 1. To ad-
just for these differences, we used a multivariable logistic re-
gression to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) for chronic opioid
use associated with each procedure, controlling for age, sex,
and preoperative use of the medications shown in Table 1.
Figure 2 illustrates these ORs. After adjusting for potential con-
founders, we found that TKA (OR, 5.10; 95% CI, 4.67-5.58;
P < .001), open cholecystectomy (OR, 3.60; 95% CI, 2.80-
4.62; P < .001), THA (OR, 2.52; 95% CI, 2.11-3.01; P < .001),
simple mastectomy (OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 2.28-3.08; P < .001),
laparoscopic cholecystectomy (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.49-1.76;
P < .001), open appendectomy (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.24-2.31;
P = .001), and cesarean delivery (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.12-1.46;
P < .001) were associated with a significant increase in the in-
cidence of chronic opioid use. There was no significant asso-
ciationinthecasesofTURP(OR,1.14;95%CI,0.73-1.77;P = .57),
laparoscopic appendectomy (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.84-1.32;
P = .65), FESS (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.90-1.37; P = .33), or cataract
surgery (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.74-1.02; P = .08).
We considered several putative risk factors for chronic opi-
oiduse:age(>50years),malesex,preoperativemedicationuse
(benzodiazepines, antidepressants, or antipsychotics), and co-
morbidities (depression, psychosis, alcohol abuse, or drug
abuse). Table 2 summarizes our results. Across all surgical pa-
tients, male sex (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.22-1.47; P < .001), age
greaterthan50years(OR,1.74;95%CI,1.56-1.93;P = .P < .001),
preoperative use of benzodiazepines (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.63-
2.04; P < .001), preoperative use of antidepressants (OR, 1.65;
95% CI, 1.47-1.84; P < .001), depression history (OR, 1.15; 95%
CI, 1.02-1.30; P = .03), alcohol abuse history (OR, 1.83; 95%
CI, 1.35-2.47; P < .001), and drug abuse history (OR, 3.15; 95%
CI, 2.24-4.40; P < .001) were associated an increased risk of
chronic opioid use. Separate analyses by procedure are pro-
vided in eTable 6 in the Supplement.
We performed a residual confounding analysis to esti-
mate the degree of confounding that would need to be pres-
ent to explain our results. In the case of TKA, we computed
that the true OR for chronic opioid use would be statistically
indistinguishable from 1 in the presence of an unmeasured
binary confounder with (1) a prevalence of 50% in the sur-
gical population, (2) a prevalence of 0% in the nonsurgical

population, and (3) an adjusted OR of 8.34 for chronic opioid
use. Assuming the same prevalence, this hypothetical con-
founder would need to have an OR for chronic opioid use of
3.22 to nullify our findings for THA. For the remaining proce-
dures, the required ORs would need to be at least 1.98 for lapa-
roscopic cholecystectomy, 4.6 for open cholecystectomy, 1.48
for open appendectomy, 1.24 for cesarean delivery, and 3.56
for simple mastectomy.
Discussion
In this study, we examined the incidence of chronic opioid use
following surgery in opioid-naive patients. Compared with a
reference group of nonsurgical patients, we found an
increased rate of chronic opioid use for patients undergoing
TKA, open cholecystectomy, THA, simple mastectomy, lapa-
roscopic cholecystectomy, FESS, open appendectomy, lapa-
roscopic appendectomy, and cesarean delivery. Preoperative
use of benzodiazepines and antidepressants was associated
with an increased risk of chronic opioid use for most of the pro-
cedures, as was a history of drug abuse.
Our analysis extends previous work in several ways. First,
previous studies have typically reported rates of opioid use fol-
lowing surgery without considering the baseline incidence of
opioid use in the population, making it unclear the degree to
which these rates exceed the expected rate of opioid use. In
this study, we addressed this issue by comparing the inci-
dence of chronic opioid use among postsurgical patients with
the incidence of chronic opioid use among a reference group
of nonsurgical patients. Second, in contrast to much of the
existing literature, our study focuses on opioid-naive pa-
tients. Third, we analyze the role of several potential risk fac-
tors—such as drug and alcohol abuse history as well as pre-
operative benzodiazepine use—that have not been considered
in previous work. Finally, some previous studies were per-
formed among Canadian patients9,10; we evaluate patients in
the United States, where a different set of opioid consump-
tion and prescribing behaviors may exist.20,21
We surmise that chronic opioid use following surgery oc-
curs because surgery may unmask an individual’
s suscepti-
bility toward long-term opioid use. Patients undergoing sur-
gery are clearly at risk for postsurgical pain, a subjective
experience that is modulated by many factors, including psy-
chological, behavioral, and medical characteristics. More-
over, acute postoperative pain, when severe, is predictive of
the development of chronic pain.22 Put together, these indi-
vidual factors may render some patients susceptible to am-
plification of acute postsurgical pain, thereby increasing their
risk for chronic opioid use following surgery.
Our results have several clinical implications. First, while
we found that surgical patients are at an increased risk for
chronic opioid use, the overall risk for chronic opioid use re-
mains low among these patients, at less than 0.5% for most of
the procedures that we examined. Thus, our results should not
be taken as advocating that patients forgo surgery out of con-
cerns for chronic opioid use. Rather, our results suggest that
primary care clinicians and surgeons should monitor opioid
use closely in the postsurgical period. Moreover, they indi-
cate that surgical patients, particularly those at higher risk for
chronic opioid use, may benefit from techniques to reduce the
risk of chronic opioid use, such as multimodal analgesia23 and
regional anesthesia,23 particularly in light of literature sug-
gesting that these interventions may improve other periopera-
tive outcomes including mortality, complication rates, length
of stay, opioid use, and opioid-related adverse events.24-26 Fi-
nally, patients may also benefit from other preoperative and
postoperative interventions, such as evidence-based psy-
chobehavioral pain management skills.
Our study should be viewed in the context of its limita-
tions. Our nonsurgical population differed in several ways
from our surgical population, and while we controlled for
many possible confounders, we cannot exclude the possibil-
ity that differences in opioid use between the 2 groups may
be due to unobserved confounding. In particular, since pain
is often the indication for a given surgery (eg, THA or TKA),
one might expect a relatively high baseline incidence of
chronic pain (postoperatively) among these patients relative

to the general population. However, it is important to note
that pain is not the primary indication for all of the proce-
dures we considered. Moreover, even in the cases of TKA and
THA, our analysis considered patients whose pain was not
sufficient to require opioids prior to their procedure. We were
also unable to measure 1 possible confounder, socioeconomic
status. We did perform a residual confounding analysis, the
results of which suggested that the magnitude of confound-
ing (in terms of the prevalence of a hypothetical confounder
among the surgical population and its effect on chronic opi-
oid use) would need to be extremely large to explain our
results. Nonetheless, on the whole, more work is needed to
establish a definitive causal relationship between surgery
and opioid use.
Second, our study was limited to privately insured pa-
tients aged 18 to 64 years, and therefore may not generalize
to other populations, such as the elderly or those receiving
Medicaid. Finally, it is worth noting that our patients were opi-
oid naive in the sense of not having filled an opioid prescrip-
tion in the 1 year prior to their surgery date; we do not know if
they had used any opioid prior to this period or whether they
used opioids surreptitiously in the year prior to surgery.
Conclusions
In sum, our results suggest that opioid-naive patients are at
an increased risk for chronic opioid use following surgery, and
thatpatientsusingantidepressantsorbenzodiazepines,aswell
as patients with a history of drug abuse, are at particularly high
risk. Whether these results apply to other surgical proce-
dures and patient populations, and whether interventions in
the postoperative period can reduce the risk of chronic opi-
oid use, is a subject for further research.
