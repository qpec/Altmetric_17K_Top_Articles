euromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of the 
paretic wrist and finger extensors is routinely used in 
stroke rehabilitation to promote recovery of muscle strength 
and upper extremity function. A recent review of 31 random-
ized controlled trials concluded that there is strong evidence 
that NMES applied in the context of task practice improves 
upper extremity function in subacute and chronic stroke.1 
This is corroborated by a recent systematic review with meta-
analysis that concluded that functional electrical stimulation 
improves activity compared with training alone.2
Cyclic NMES (cNMES) is a commonly used and widely 
available method of administering NMES in stroke rehabilita-
tion.3 With cNMES, stimulation is delivered according to an 
on–off cycle, with the cycle timing, repetitions, and intensity 
of stimulation set by the therapist. Thus, cNMES requires 
no active participation from the patient, and because the 
patient does not control the timing or intensity of stimulation, 
cNMES is not easily used to assist functional task practice 
(FTP). Nevertheless, several studies have shown that cNMES 
can reduce upper limb motor impairment compared with con-
trol groups4,5 although the longevity of effect is inconsistent 
across studies.6
Contralaterally controlled functional electrical stimulation 
(CCFES) is a new NMES modality that enables the patient to 
actively open their paretic hand and perform functional tasks. 
With CCFES, the patient controls the stimulation to their 
paretic hand in real-time by opening and closing their strong 
hand. An instrumented glove worn on the strong hand modu-
lates the stimulation intensity to the paretic hand extensors so 
that both hands open synchronously (Figure I in the online-
only Data Supplement).7 CCFES may be more effective than 
cNMES because the stimulation is intention driven; the patient 
Background and Purpose—It is unknown whether one method of neuromuscular electrical stimulation for poststroke 
upper limb rehabilitation is more effective than another. Our aim was to compare the effects of contralaterally controlled 
functional electrical stimulation (CCFES) with cyclic neuromuscular electrical stimulation (cNMES).
Methods—Stroke patients with chronic (>6 months) moderate to severe upper extremity hemiparesis (n=80) were randomized 
to receive 10 sessions/wk of CCFES- or cNMES-assisted hand opening exercise at home plus 20 sessions of functional 
task practice in the laboratory for 12 weeks. The task practice for the CCFES group was stimulation assisted. The primary 
outcome was change in Box and Block Test (BBT) score at 6 months post treatment. Upper extremity Fugl–Meyer and 
Arm Motor Abilities Test were also measured.
Results—At 6 months post treatment, the CCFES group had greater improvement on the BBT, 4.6 (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 2.2–7.0), than the cNMES group, 1.8 (95% CI, 0.6–3.0), between-group difference of 2.8 (95% CI, 0.1–5.5), 
P=0.045. No significant between-group difference was found for the upper extremity Fugl–Meyer (P=0.888) or Arm 
Motor Abilities Test (P=0.096). Participants who had the largest improvements on BBT were <2 years post stroke with 
moderate (ie, not severe) hand impairment at baseline. Among these, the 6-month post-treatment BBT gains of the 
CCFES group, 9.6 (95% CI, 5.6–13.6), were greater than those of the cNMES group, 4.1 (95% CI, 1.7–6.5), between-
group difference of 5.5 (95% CI, 0.8–10.2), P=0.023.
Conclusions—CCFES improved hand dexterity more than cNMES in chronic stroke survivors.

controls the stimulation intensity and therefore the degree of 
opening of their hand. This repetitive temporal coupling of 
motor intention and motor response may promote plasticity 
and neural reorganization that underlies recovery of func-
tion.8–10 With control of the timing and intensity of CCFES, 
patients can participate in functional task therapy more fully 
than might be possible without the assistance of the stimula-
tion. Our initial CCFES studies with patients >6 months post 
stroke (n=6) demonstrated that CCFES can improve finger 
extension strength, range of motion, and control.7,11
The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy of 
CCFES to cNMES on upper limb impairment and function in 
patients who are >6 months post stroke. We hypothesized that 
CCFES would improve hand function more than cNMES, and 
that outcomes would depend on the severity of impairment 
and time post stroke.
Methods
Participants and Treatment Assignment
This was a single-site, 2-arm parallel-group study with blinded 
assessment. The study was conducted at an academic medical cen-
ter in Cleveland, OH, and was approved by their institutional review 
board. Participants were recruited from the outpatient stroke clinics 
and therapy services, and the study nurse obtained their informed 
consent. Full eligibility criteria are provided in Table I in the in the 
online-only Data Supplement. An abbreviated list of selection crite-
ria includes >6 months from hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke; uni-
lateral finger extensor paresis indicated by a score of ≤4 of 5 on the 
manual muscle test (Medical Research Council scale12); sufficient 
active shoulder and elbow movement to volitionally position the 
paretic hand in the workspace for table-top task practice; hand open-
ing elicited by electrical stimulation of the paretic finger and thumb 
extensors without pain; no intramuscular botulinum toxin injection of 
any upper limb muscle in the previous 3 months; and not receiving 
concomitant occupational therapy.
At enrollment, all participants were classified as having moder-
ate or severe hand impairment by the assessing therapist. Moderate 
was defined as having at least 10° active wrist extension, 10° active 
thumb abduction/extension, and 10° active extension in at least 2 
additional digits. This definition represents the least amount of move-
ment that is required to participate in constraint-induced movement 
therapy.13 Participants with less movement than this who met all the 
other selection criteria were considered to have severe hand impair-
ment. After baseline assessment, treatment assignment to CCFES or 
cNMES was made using minimization, an adaptive treatment assign-
ment procedure,14 to balance the following 4 factors between the 2 
treatment groups: (1) degree of impairment (ie, moderate or severe), 
(2) whether the paretic hand was dominant before the stroke, (3) side 
of paresis, and (4) sex. A computer program running the minimiza-
tion algorithm14,15 determined the treatment assignment that best bal-
anced the 4 factors between the 2 treatments. The treating therapist 
informed the participants of their treatment assignment.
Device Setup
For each participant, surface electrodes were positioned over 
the forearm finger and thumb extensors to produce hand open-
ing.7,11,16 Up to 3 electrodes were used, each delivering pulses of 
electric current with a pulse frequency of 35 Hz and amplitude 
of 40 mA. The strength of muscle contraction was modulated 
with pulse duration (0–250 µs). For each electrode, a maximum 
pulse duration was determined, defined as that which produced a 
functional degree of finger and thumb extension without pain. For 
participants in the CCFES group, the stimulator was programmed 
to increase the pulse duration for each electrode in proportion 
to the amount of opening of an instrumented glove worn on the 
contralateral nonparetic hand.7 For participants in the cNMES 
group, the stimulator automatically and repetitively ramped the pulse 
durations from zero to maximum in 1 second, maintained the stimu-
lation at maximum for several seconds, and then ramped down the 
pulse duration to zero, as is commonly done in clinical practice. Each 
participant was trained to put on the electrodes and use the stimulator 
at home according to their group assignment, using photographs of 
the electrodes on their own arm to guide electrode placement.
Treatments
CCFES and cNMES treatments lasted 12 weeks and consisted of (1) 
20 sessions of therapist-guided FTP in the laboratory (2 per week 
except on weeks that included an assessment session), (2) 10 ses-
sions/wk of self-administered repetitive hand opening exercise at 
home.
FTP was performed for 60 minutes per session. An occupational 
therapist instructed and guided the participants in doing tasks that 
required them to use their paretic hand to grasp, manipulate, and 
release objects commonly used in daily life.16 Task difficulty was 
increased as the participant mastered simple hand tasks. Participants 
in the CCFES group used CCFES to assist the paretic hand in practic-
ing the tasks. Participants in the cNMES group practiced tasks with 
no electrical stimulation because cNMES is not amenable to assisting 
FTP because it is not controlled by the patient. Therefore, to ensure 
both groups received an equivalent weekly duration of electrical 
stimulation, the cNMES group received longer sessions of stimulated 
hand opening exercise at home than the CCFES group.
The self-administered home stimulation exercise sessions were 
50 minutes for the CCFES group and 60 minutes for the cNMES 
group, so that the total duration of stimulation received by both 
groups was equivalent, ≈10 hours of stimulation per week (cNMES: 
60 minutes/session×10 sessions/wk=10 hours/wk. CCFES: 50 min-
utes/session×10 sessions/wk+60 minutes of CCFES during an FTP 
session×20 FTP sessions in 12 weeks=10 hours/wk). During an 
exercise session, participants with CCFES were prompted by light 
and sound cues from the stimulator to repeatedly open both hands 
for 6 seconds and then relax for 20 seconds. For participants with 
cNMES, the stimulator automatically turned on and off with the 
same timing as the cues that were produced for CCFES, and the 
participants were instructed to attempt to open their paretic hand 
when the stimulation turned on. For both groups, the open/relax 
durations (cues for CCFES) were progressively changed during the 
first 4 weeks until the open cue was 8 seconds, and the rest between 
contractions was 10 seconds, as in previous study.16 Participants 
filled out diaries weekly to record when they performed their home 
exercise sessions. The stimulator also logged usage data, which 
was downloaded at each laboratory visit (twice a week), and helped 
identify any problems participants may have had completing the 
home exercises.
Outcome Assessments
Assessments were made by a blinded assessor at baseline, every 3 
weeks during the treatment period, end of treatment, and 2, 4, and 
6 months after completion of treatment. Participants were asked 
to not use their stimulators for 24 hours before their assessments 
at weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12 to avoid any possible transient carry-over 
or fatigue effects.
The Box and Block Test (BBT) was the primary outcome mea-
sure. The BBT is a valid and reliable measure of manual dexter-
ity,17 which counts how many times the participant can pick up 1 
block at a time, move it over a partition, and release it in a tar-
get area within 60 seconds. The BBT measures change in func-
tional grasp and release, which is the focus of the treatments in 
this study; therefore, it was chosen as the primary outcome mea-
sure. Secondary measures included the Arm Motor Abilities Test 
(AMAT), an activity measure (ie, functional ability) with a maxi-
mum score of 5,18 and the upper extremity Fugl–Meyer assess-
ment, a measure of upper limb impairment with a maximum score 
of 66.19,20

A questionnaire developed by the study team but with no 
independent validation was administered at the beginning of the 
end-of-treatment visit to assess the participants’ impression of 
the intervention’s effectiveness and ease of using the device.11 
Monitoring for adverse events was done at each visit by the treating 
therapist or study nurse (at assessment visits) who documented the 
occurrence or absence of adverse events in the participant notes. 
All adverse events were assessed by the principal investigator and 
referred to the study physician if necessary for follow-up.
Statistical Analysis
We hypothesized that participants treated with CCFES would have 
greater improvement in upper extremity motor function from baseline 
to 6 months post treatment than participants treated with cNMES, and 
that participants with moderate hand impairment at baseline would 
have greater improvements than participants with severe hand impair-
ment at baseline. For each outcome measure, least square means, which 
adjusted for missing values and severity of impairment (moderate or 
severe), were computed for each group at each time point and were 
used to estimate the within-group mean changes from baseline with 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the between-group differences in 
change from baseline to 6 months post treatment. These least square 
means were derived using a linear mixed-effects modeling approach. 
To detect a difference between groups of at least 6 points on the BBT 
at 6 months post treatment and assuming a SD of 10.5 blocks at each 
time point for both groups, with a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 and 
power of 80%, the target sample size was 80.
Results
From March 2009 to October 2014, 304 patients were screened, 
125 underwent a formal eligibility assessment, and 80 were 
enrolled and assigned CCFES or cNMES (Figure 1). At 
baseline, there were no significant differences between the study 
groups on the assessed demographic, stroke-related, and upper 
extremity motor characteristics (Table 1). Of the 80 participants

enrolled, 72 completed the treatment and were analyzed. Eight 
of the participants (10%) withdrew from the study within the 
first 3 weeks of the treatment period, all from the CCFES group. 
Reasons for withdrawal are provided in Table II in the online-
only Data Supplement. The baseline characteristics of CCFES 
participants who completed treatment and who withdrew are 
compared in Table III in the online-only Data Supplement.
The mean (SD) percentage of prescribed hours of home 
stimulation exercise performed, according to the stimula-
tors’ electronic data logger was 96% (8.7%) for the CCFES 
group and 94% (9.5%) for the cNMES group (Mann–Whitney 
U test, P=0.31). The mean (SD) number of FTP sessions 
attended, of 20 possible, was 18 (2.4) for CCFES and 18 (1.8) 
for cNMES (Mann–Whitney U test, P=0.43). In response to 
the questionnaire at end of treatment, all participants reported 
that they put on the electrodes at home independently, and all 
CCFES participants except one reported that they put on the 
glove independently.
By 6 months post treatment, both groups had significant 
increases in BBT score (Table 2). The gain was greater for 
the CCFES group than for the cNMES group, with a mean 
between-group difference of 2.8 (95% CI, 0.1–5.5), P=0.045 
(Figure 2A; Table 2). Both groups improved on the upper 
extremity Fugl–Meyer (Figure 2B; Table 2), but with no sig-
nificant between-group differences, P=0.888. At 6 months 
post treatment, the CCFES group had a significant gain on the 
AMAT, but the cNMES group did not (Figure 2C; Table 2). The 
between-group difference on the AMAT was not statistically 
significant, P=0.096.
Secondary analyses showed that the participants with 
the greatest gains on the BBT were <2 years post stroke 
(Figure 3) and had moderate hand impairment at baseline 
(Figure 4A). Among these participants, the CCFES group 
had 6-month post-treatment gains on the BBT of 9.6 (95% 
CI, 5.6–13.6) versus 4.1 (95% CI, 1.7–6.6) for the cNMES 
group, a between-group difference in gains of 5.5 (95% CI, 
0.8–10.2), P=0.023 (Table 2). Similarly, the greatest gains on 
the AMAT were achieved by CCFES participants who had 
moderate rather than severe hand impairment at baseline 
(Figure 4C). But the greatest gains on the upper extremity 
Fugl–Meyer were achieved at midtreatment by the CCFES 
participants who had severe rather than moderate hand 
impairment (Figure 4B).
Responses to the end-of-treatment questionnaire showed 
that 97% of the CCFES group and 88% of the cNMES 
group agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, “I can 
use my hand better now than before the study.” Also, 91% 
of the CCFES group and 86% of the cNMES group agreed 
or strongly agreed with “I wish this treatment had been part 
of my initial therapy.” There were no serious, unexpected, 
study-related adverse events. However, 1 participant fre-
quently had headaches after FTP sessions, 3 participants 
had skin irritation from the electrodes, and 1 participant 
found the stimulation transiently uncomfortable.

Discussion
Among participants with chronic moderate to severe hand 
impairment after stroke, 12 weeks of CCFES therapy 
improved manual dexterity more than an equivalent dose of 
cNMES. The minimum clinically important difference for 
the BBT has not been established, but the minimum detect-
able change is 5.5 blocks.21 Therefore, for the main analysis, 
which included participants with moderate and severe hand 
impairment over a wide range of chronicity, the average mag-
nitudes of change on the BBT (4.6 blocks for CCFES and 1.8 
blocks for cNMES) and the average between-group differ-
ence (2.8 blocks) fall short of the minimum detectable change 
threshold and are not clinically relevant.
The magnitudes of improvement and between-group dif-
ferences favoring CCFES were greater in participants with 
moderate (not severe) hand impairment at baseline whose 
strokes were >6 months but <2 years ago. In that subset 
of participants, the average change in BBT scores for the 
CCFES group (9.6 blocks) and the upper limit of its 95% 
CI (13.6 blocks; Table 2) exceeded the minimum detectable 
change and would likely be considered clinically impor-
tant by many patients and clinicians. Also, in that subset of 
participants, the average between-group difference in BBT 
scores (5.5 blocks) and the upper limit of its 95% CI (10.2 
blocks) reached or exceeded minimum detectable change.
The finding of no significant between-group difference on 
the upper extremity Fugl–Meyer may be because the measure 
is more heavily weighted toward assessing proximal upper 
limb movement rather than distal hand function. CCFES 
may have its greatest distinctive impact on distal function. 
The tasks rated in the AMAT require both proximal and dis-
tal function, which may explain why the CCFES group had 
statistically significant improvement on the AMAT but the 
cNMES group did not.
Few previous studies have directly compared electrical 
stimulation modalities. Our recently published study of 122 
subacute (≤6 months) stroke survivors found no significant 
differences between cNMES, EMG-triggered NMES, and 
sensory stimulation, on their effect on upper limb function,22 
a finding that confirmed previous smaller studies.23,24 Before 
the present study, our pilot randomized controlled trial with 
patients ≤6 months post stroke (n=21) showed that CCFES 
produced greater improvements than cNMES, but the small 
sample size limited the statistical power.16 Recently, other 
investigators compared a variation of CCFES with cNMES 
in patients ≤3 months post stroke (n=60) and showed that 
CCFES produced significantly greater gains than cNMES.25 
Unlike these previous trials, the present study included only 
stroke survivors with chronic hemiplegia (>6 months), a popu-
lation for which it is even more challenging to show positive 
benefits of rehabilitative therapy.
The finding of a statistically significant between-group dif-
ference on the BBT in a chronic population is encouraging 
and may point to a true mechanistic advantage underlying the 
CCFES method of electrical stimulation therapy. One or more 
of the elements that distinguish CCFES from cNMES may be 
important in facilitating motor recovery, namely, (1) real-time 
patient-controlled intensity of stimulation to the paretic hand 
(ie, intention-driven movement), (2) synchronized opening of 
both hands, and (3) stimulation-assisted task practice with the 
paretic hand. Thus, the method of NMES may matter.
This study also helps to clarify which patients with stroke 
may be the best candidates for NMES therapies. Patients 
>2 years post stroke should not be expected to achieve 
significant improvement with either cNMES or CCFES.

 Knutson et al  CCFES vs cNMES for Hand Rehabilitation   2601
Patients <2 years post stroke with some finger, thumb, and 
wrist extension are the best candidates for CCFES therapy. 
Patients with no residual finger extension may expect to 
gain arm movement from CCFES, but not manual dexter-
ity. Some patients may find it more difficult to self-admin-
ister CCFES than cNMES because it requires donning a 
glove on the unaffected hand and attending to cues from 
the stimulator, yet the reasons given by at least 6 of the 8 
participants who started and discontinued CCFES did not 
clearly point to treatment elements that distinguish CCFES 
from cNMES.
Strengths of this study include high compliance rates, 
no concomitant therapy, extended follow-up, and care-
ful matching of therapy dose across 2 active treatment 
groups. Yet, there are several limitations to this study. The 
subgroup analyses investigating the effects of severity of 
hand impairment and time post stroke were preplanned, but 
exploratory, and therefore the study was not powered for 
them.
Motor rehabilitation trials preclude double blinding, so par-
ticipants were aware of their treatment assignment. All partici-
pants were informed that one group would receive stimulation 
that opens the weak hand, and the other group would wear a 
glove on the strong hand to control stimulation to the weak 
hand. Participants in both groups were instructed to exert 
effort to open their paretic hand in synchrony with stimulation 
during their home exercise sessions. That instruction was rein-
forced at each task practice session, with the expectation that 
similar proportions of the 2 groups would follow that instruc-
tion. There was no way to ensure that cNMES participants did 
not open their contralateral unaffected hand in synchrony with 
the stimulation. This potential crossover effect would reduce 
the contrast between the 2 treatments, biasing the outcome 
favoring cNMES.
The study was conducted at least 6 months post stroke, 
when rehabilitation is typically no longer prescribed; how-
ever, conducting the study with chronic patients eliminated 
spontaneous recovery as a possible confounder. Showing 
functionally relevant outcomes during the chronic phase is 
needed to incentivize healthcare reformers to make it pos-
sible for patients to receive such therapies even beyond 6 
months.
Future trials should include validated patient reported 
outcomes and outcomes that are sensitive to participation 
and quality of life.26 Also, the translatability of CCFES 
therapy to other research sites and to clinical practice still 
needs to be established. A future multisite study is needed to 
confirm the findings of this study and to demonstrate gener-
alizability across different rehabilitation centers.
Conclusions
In patients with chronic (>6 months) severe to moderate 
hand impairment after stroke, 12 weeks of CCFES ther-
apy improved manual dexterity at 6 months post treatment 
more than an equivalent dose of cNMES. The advantage of 
CCFES over cNMES was greatest in participants who were 
<2 years post stroke and who had moderate rather than 
severe hand impairment.
