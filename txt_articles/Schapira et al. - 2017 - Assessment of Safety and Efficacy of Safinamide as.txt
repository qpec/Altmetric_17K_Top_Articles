IMPORTANCE Although levodopa remains the most effective oral pharmacotherapy for
Parkinson disease (PD), its use is often limited by wearing off effect and dyskinesias.
Management of such complications continues to be a significant challenge.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the efficacy and safety of safinamide (an oral aminoamide
derivative with dopaminergic and nondopaminergic actions) in levodopa-treated patients
with motor fluctuations.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From March 5, 2009, through February 23, 2012,
patients from academic PD care centers were randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive double-blind
adjunctive safinamide or placebo for 24 weeks. All patients had idiopathic PD with “
off”time
(time when medication effect has worn off and parkinsonian features, including bradykinesia
and rigidity, return) of greater than 1.5 hours per day (excluding morning akinesia). Their
pharmacotherapy included oral levodopa plus benserazide or carbidopa in a regimen that had
been stable for 4 weeks or longer. During screening, each patient’
s regimen was optimized to
minimize motor fluctuations. Study eligibility required that after 4 weeks of optimized
treatment, the patients still have more than 1.5 hours per day of off time. Adverse events
caused the premature study discontinuation of 12 individuals (4.4%) in the safinamide group
and 10 individuals (3.6%) in the placebo group.
INTERVENTIONS Patients took safinamide or placebo as 1 tablet daily with breakfast. If no
tolerability issues arose by day 14, the starting dose, 50 mg, was increased to 100 mg.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The prespecified primary outcome was each treatment
group’
s mean change from baseline to week 24 (or last “
on”treatment value) in daily “
on”
time (relief of parkinsonian motor features) without troublesome dyskinesia, as assessed
from diary data.
RESULTS At 119 centers, 549 patients were randomized (mean [SD] age, 61.9 [9.0] years; 334
male [60.8%] and 371 white [67.6%]): 274 to safinamide and 275 to placebo. Among them,
245 (89.4%) receiving safinamide and 241 (87.6%) receiving placebo completed the study.
Mean (SD) change in daily on time without troublesome dyskinesia was +1.42 (2.80) hours for
safinamide, from a baseline of 9.30 (2.41) hours, vs +0.57 (2.47) hours for placebo, from a
baseline of 9.06 (2.50) hours (least-squares mean difference, 0.96 hour; 95% CI, 0.56-1.37
hours; P < .001, analysis of covariance). The most frequently reported adverse event was
dyskinesia (in 40 [14.6%] vs 15 [5.5%] and as a severe event in 5 [1.8%] vs 1 [0.4%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The outcomes of this trial support safinamide as an effective
adjunct to levodopa in patients with PD and motor fluctuations to improve on time without
troublesome dyskinesia and reduce wearing off.

L
evodopa is the most effective and widely used pharma-
cotherapy for Parkinson disease (PD).1,2 Unfortunately,
oral levodopa use is limited by the development of
motor complications (wearing off and dyskinesias), which are
related in part to the daily dosage used.3,4 Wearing off can be
managed by increasing the dose or frequency of oral le-
vodopa administration or by adding a monoamine oxidase B
(MAO-B) inhibitor, catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) in-
hibitor, or dopamine agonist.2 However, such strategies can
increase the risk of dyskinesia.
Safinamide is a water-soluble, orally administered ami-
noamide derivative that acts as a potent, highly selective, re-
versible MAO-B inhibitor.5-7 In addition, it blocks voltage-
dependentsodiumandcalciumchannelsandreducesneuronal
glutamate release.8 In early clinical studies, it was found to im-
prove motor control in patients with PD who received it as an
add-on treatment to a dopamine agonist9-11 or as an adjunct
to levodopa.10 We describe the results of a phase 3 trial of sa-
finamideasanadjuncttolevodopainpatientswithPDandmo-
tor fluctuations who were taking levodopa.
Methods
The Safinamide Treatment as Add-on to Levodopa study was
adouble-blind,parallel-group,24-weektrialofsafinamide(50-
100 mg/d orally) vs placebo in patients taking stable dosages
of levodopa and concomitant PD medications. The complete
trialprotocolcanbefoundinSupplement1.Thestudywascon-
ducted in accordance with the study protocol and its amend-
ments, the Declaration of Helsinki,12 the International Con-
ference on Harmonisation Harmonised Tripartite Guideline13
for good clinical practices, and all applicable local regulatory
requirements, including institutional review board approval.
Study investigators fully explained the trial to all patients and,
before study participation, all patients provided written in-
formed consent.
Study Participants
In 21 countries in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and North
America,126centersscreened851patientsfromMarch5,2009,
through February 23, 2012. All patients were required to be 30
to 80 years old and have a diagnosis of idiopathic PD by clini-
cal evaluation and Queen Square Brain Bank criteria, with a
longer than 3-year duration since diagnosis, a Hoehn and Yahr
rating of stages 1 to 4 during an “off” phase (time when medi-
cation effect has worn off and parkinsonian features, includ-
ing bradykinesia and rigidity, return), and daily off time greater
than 1.5 hours (excluding morning akinesia). Patients were also
required to be levodopa responsive and following an oral le-
vodopa regimen (3-10 doses per day of any levodopa prepa-
ration, with or without a COMT inhibitor) that had been stable
for 4 weeks. Their PD pharmacotherapy could include a dopa-
mine agonist, anticholinergic, COMT inhibitor, and/or aman-
tadine at stable dosage. Patients were excluded for severe, dis-
abling peak-dose or biphasic dyskinesia and/or wide or
unpredictable symptom fluctuations. The study’
s full exclu-
sion criteria are summarized in the eTable in Supplement 2.
Study Design
During a 10-day screening period, each patient’
s PD pharma-
cotherapy was adjusted to minimize motor fluctuations. Pa-
tients then entered an observation phase that lasted 4 weeks
(or longer, if needed to permit 4-week observation of an
unchanged regimen). At the study’
s conclusion (the patient’
s
baseline visit), eligibility required that the patient still be ex-
periencing daily off time greater than 1.5 hours.
In a double-blind fashion, enrolled patients were random-
ized (1:1) to receive safinamide or matching placebo, taken as
1 tablet daily with breakfast (Figure 1). They underwent post-
baseline efficacy and safety assessments at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12,
18, and 24 (or premature discontinuation). In addition, they
or their caregivers were telephoned on days 7 and 21 to assess
study drug tolerability. If there were no tolerability issues by
day 14, the starting dosage, 50 mg/d, was increased to 100
mg/d. Patients were permitted to continue standard oral PD
pharmacotherapies at stable dosage (except MAO-B inhibi-
tors, which could not be used within 8 weeks before screen-
ing). Patients requiring an increase in antiparkinsonian treat-
ment before week 24 were asked to participate in all further
assessments. In such cases, the assessment used for the pri-
mary efficacy outcome was performed before the dose in-
crease.Patientscompleting24weekswereeligibleforanopen-
label extension study. Those not continuing had their study
drug dosage tapered during a 1-week period (week 25), with a
follow-up safety assessment 4 weeks later (week 29).
Randomization and Masking
At patient enrollment, study site personnel contacted a cen-
tralized, computerized interactive voice-response system,
which created the study’
s randomization scheme (stratified by
country or region) and assigned each patient the appropriate
medication, identified by kit number and provided for each
dose level of active drug or placebo as matching tablets in
matching blister packs. The randomization code remained
blinded throughout the study.
Efficacy Measures
Theprimaryefficacyoutcomewaschangefrombaselinetoweek

features) without troublesome dyskinesia, as recorded by
patients or caregivers in a diary14 maintained for the 3 days
Key Points
Question Is safinamide a beneficial treatment for motor
fluctuations in patients using oral levodopa for the treatment of
Parkinson disease?
Findings In this 24-week, randomized clinical trial, 549 patients
had more than 1.5 hours per day of “
off”time despite
pharmacotherapy optimized to minimize motor fluctuations.
Safinamide taken once daily significantly increased daily “
on”time
without troublesome dyskinesia by a mean 1.42 hours vs 0.57 hour
for placebo.
Meaning The study supports the use of safinamide as an effective
adjunct to levodopa for fluctuating Parkinson disease.

preceding the baseline visit and each postbaseline visit. The
diaries characterized each 30-minute interval during the
18-hour day (0600 to 2400 hours) as on time, on time with
nontroublesome dyskinesia, on time with troublesome dys-
kinesia, off time, or time asleep. To optimize their accuracy,
all diary data analyses were based on entries for the second
and third days.
Secondary efficacy outcomes were based on diary en-
tries, Unified Parkinson’
s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores,
Clinical Global Impression–Change (CGI-C) ratings, Clinical
Global Impression–Severity (CGI-S) ratings, Patient Global Im-
pression–Change (PGI-C) ratings, 39-item Parkinson Disease
Questionnaire (PDQ-39) scores, EuroQoL 5 dimensions
(EQ-5D) scores, change in levodopa daily dosage, Dyskinesia
Rating Scale (DRS) scores, and Cogtest PD Battery scores. Five
such outcomes, including mean change in daily off time, mean
change in UPDRS Part III (motor examination) and Part II (ac-
tivities of daily living) scores during an on phase, the propor-
tion of patients with an improved CGI-C rating, and mean
change in PDQ-39 summary index score, were predefined as
key secondary outcomes. Tertiary outcomes were based on
Hoehn and Yahr stage; Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression,
17-item grid version, scores; and Mini-Mental State Examina-
tion scores.
Efficacy Analyses
Among all randomized patients (intention-to-treat popula-
tion), the primary efficacy outcome was tested by analysis of
covariance, with treatment and country or region as fixed ef-
fects and baseline value as the covariate. For patients who dis-
continued or changed use of their PD medication, a week 24
value was imputed by a last observation carried forward ap-
proach. If the difference between treatment groups was sta-
tistically significant (P ≤ .05), the key secondary end points
were to be analyzed hierarchically, unless a difference be-
tween groups was statistically nonsignificant, in which case
all further analyses would be performed only to obtain nomi-
nal P values. The same analysis of covariance model used for
the primary efficacy analysis was used for all other out-
comes, except CGI-C and PGI-C scores at week 24, which were
assessed by analysis of variance with fixed effects for treat-
ment and region, and the proportion of patients with improve-
ment on the CGI-C, which was assessed by logistic regression
with treatment and region as fixed effects. The resulting odds
ratio was subjected to the Wald χ2 test. As a sensitivity analy-
sis, change in daily on time was examined using a mixed-
effects repeated-measures model, with no imputation of
missing data.
Safety Measures
The safety of safinamide was assessed by summary statistics
for all patients exposed to study medication (safety popula-
tion). Safety measures included treatment-emergent adverse
events (TEAEs), as classified by the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities, version 13.015; serious adverse events
(SAEs); and discontinuations attributable to TEAEs. They also
included physical, neurologic, ophthalmologic, and dermato-
logic examinations; 12-lead electrocardiography; and clinical
laboratory tests. The incidence of impulse control disorders
was assessed by the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compul-

sive Disorders in Parkinson Disease,16 and daytime sleepi-
ness was assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.
Sample-Size Calculation
On the basis of a 2-sided, 2-sample t test applied to findings
of the Parkinson’
s Rasagiline: Efficacy and Safety in the
Treatment of Off (PRESTO) study,17 a minimum of 416
patients (208 per treatment group) would provide 90%
power or greater to detect a difference of 0.75 hour in daily
on time between groups, assuming an SD of 2.35 hours (for
change from baseline to week 24) and a type I error rate of
5%. Assuming a dropout (or missing data) rate of 14%, a
minimum of 484 patients (242 per treatment group) would
need to be randomized.
Results
Participant Disposition and Characteristics
At 119 centers, 549 patients were randomized (mean [SD] age,
61.9 [9.0] years; 334 male [60.8%] and 371 white [67.6%]):
274 to safinamide and 275 to placebo (Figure 1). Among
them, 245 patients (89.4%) in the safinamide group and 241
patients (87.6%) in the placebo group completed the study. In
both groups, the most common reason for premature discon-
tinuation was TEAEs (12 patients [4.4%] in the safinamide
group and 10 patients [3.6%] in the placebo group). During
the study, 11 patients (4.0%) taking safinamide and 21
patients (7.6%) taking placebo required a change in antipar-
kinsonian treatment.
The mean (SD) PD duration was 8.9 (4.6) years, and the
mean (SD) levodopa dosage was 776.5 (423.8) mg/d, with
408 patients (74.3%) also taking a dopamine agonist, 166
(30.2%) taking amantadine, 95 (17.3%) taking anticholiner-
gics, and 83 (15.1%) taking entacapone. Baseline characteris-
tics revealed no significant differences between the treat-
ment groups (Table 1).
Study Drug Exposure
Mean (SD) study drug exposure was 162.3 (37.7) days in the sa-
finamide group and 160.7 (37.5) days in the placebo group. At
day 14, a total of 219 of 241 patients (90.9%) in the safinamide
groupand225of239patients(94.1%)intheplacebogroupwere
prescribed the 100-mg target dose.

Efficacy Outcomes
At week 24, the mean (SD) increase in total daily on time with-
out troublesome dyskinesia (primary efficacy outcome) was
+1.42 (2.80) hours in the safinamide group and +0.57 (2.47)
hours in the placebo group (least-squares [LS] mean differ-
ence, 0.96 hour; 95% CI, 0.56-1.37 hours; P < .001). In the
mixed-effects repeated-measures model, the mean (SD) in-
crease was +1.61 (2.81) vs +0.17 (2.38) hours (LS mean differ-
ence, 0.93 hour; 95% CI, 0.50-1.36 hours; P < .001).
Among key secondary outcomes (Table 2), the mean (SD)
decrease in daily off time was –1.56 (2.35) vs –0.54 (2.21) hours
(LS mean difference, –1.03 hours; 95% CI, –1.40 to –0.67 hours;
P < .001). Mean (SD) decrease (improvement) in UPDRS Part III
score rated during an on phase was –3.43 (7.72) vs –1.83 (8.23)
(LS mean difference, –1.82; 95% CI, –3.01 to –0.62; P = .003).
However, mean (SD) change in UPDRS Part II score was nonsig-
nificantat–1.07(3.63)vs–0.75(3.95)(LSmeandifference,–0.43;
95% CI, –1.02 to 0.16; P = .15). The proportion of patients with
improvement (scores of 1, 2, or 3) on CGI-C was 57.7% vs 41.8%
(oddsratio,1.92;95%CI,1.36-2.70;nominalP < .001).Mean(SD)
decrease (improvement) in PDQ-39 summary index score was
–3.17(10.86)vs–0.68(10.51)(LSmeandifference,–2.33;95%CI,
–3.98 to –0.68; nominal P = .006).
Among other secondary findings (Table 2), mean improve-
mentsinthesafinamidegroup(vsplacebo)hadnominalP ≤ .05
for CGI-C, PGI-C, and CGI-S scores, off time after the morning
levodopa dose, EQ-5D index score, and levodopa daily dos-
age, representing decreases in 18 patients (6.6%) taking safin-
amide and 4 patients (1.5%) taking placebo. On the UPDRS Part
IV (complications of therapy), the safinamide group had an ap-
proximately 0.1-point increase (worsening) in scores on items
32 to 34 and 32 to 35. For both increases, the LS mean differ-
ence from placebo was 0.26 point (95% CI, 0.02-0.50 for items
32 -24 and 0.01-0.52 for items 32-35; nominal P = .04 for both).
In a post hoc efficacy analysis, the safinamide group ex-
hibited a significant increase vs placebo in daily on time with-
out troublesome dyskinesia while receiving treatment with 50
mg/d at the end of week 2, the first postbaseline assessment
time point (mean [SD], 1.04 [2.24] hours vs 0.40 [1.81] hours;
P < .001 by paired, 2-sided t test). This benefit was main-
tained at all subsequent time points (Figure 2).
Safety
Overall, 186 patients (67.9%) in the safinamide group and 190
patients (69.1%) in the placebo group reported TEAEs (Table 3).
Among the TEAEs most frequently reported, dyskinesia was
more common in the safinamide group than in the placebo
group (40 [14.6%] vs 15 [5.5%]). The incidence of TEAEs rated
as severe was lower in the safinamide group than in the pla-
cebo group (19 [6.9%] vs 25 [9.1%]). However, dyskinesia was
reported as severe in 5 patients (1.8%) taking safinamide com-
pared with 1 patient (0.4%) taking placebo.
Eighteen patients (6.6%) taking safinamide and 26
patients (9.5%) taking placebo experienced treatment-
emergent SAEs. The SAEs in more than 1 patient in either
group were breast cancer and visual hallucinations, each in 2
patients taking safinamide; and diarrhea, hallucinations,
and myocardial ischemia, each in 2 patients taking placebo.
Fourteen patients (5.1%) in the safinamide group and 12
patients (4.4%) in the placebo group had TEAEs that led to in-
terruption of study drug treatment. In the safinamide group,
12 of these patients discontinued participation in the trial, 1
decided to withdraw, and 1 remained in the trial. In the pla-
cebo group, 10 patients discontinued participation in the trial,
1 decided to withdraw, and 1 died. Six patients (2.2%) taking
safinamide and 1 (0.4%) taking placebo interrupted their treat-
ment because of nervous system events: dyskinesia in 3 pa-
tients in the safinamide group, PD worsening in 2 patients in
the safinamide group, paraesthesia in 1 patient in the safin-
amide group, and dizziness in 1 patient in the placebo group.
Therewere3deaths:1(0.4%)inthesafinamidegroup(PDwors-
ening, considered unlikely to be related to study medication)
and 2 (0.7%) in the placebo group (myocardial ischemia and
acute lymphocytic leukemia).
The treatment groups exhibited no clinically meaningful
mean changes in physical findings, laboratory values, or elec-
trocardiographic data, and abnormal postbaseline shifts had
similar incidences across groups. Questionnaire for Impulsive-
Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson Disease and Epworth
Sleepiness Scale total scores showed little change. (In the sa-
finamide group, the mean changes were –0.03 and –0.28, re-
spectively.) Results of ophthalmologic examinations were
similar in both groups and revealed no significant worsening.
Discussion
At 100 mg/d, safinamide significantly increased mean daily on
time without troublesome dyskinesia by 0.96 hour more than
placebo in patients taking a stable dose of levodopa. The in-
creasewasestablishedby2weeksandwassubsequentlymain-
tained. In addition, safinamide reduced mean daily off time,
improved motor function (UPDRS Part III), improved quality
of life (PDQ-39, EQ-5D), and revealed a global benefit (CGI).
Early-morning off time was also reduced.
Overall, the study’
s diary data suggest safinamide effects
similar or superior to those reported for MAO-B or COMT in-
hibitors evaluated as levodopa adjuncts to reduce off time for
advanced PD. Notwithstanding the limitations of cross-trial
comparisons,includingpotentialdifferencesinpatients’demo-
graphic and PD characteristics, the reduction in off time for the
safinamidegroup,1.03hoursvsplacebo,identifiedat24weeks

of the 26-week PRESTO study,17 in which the reduction vs pla-

ever, on time with troublesome dyskinesia accounted for 32%
of a total increase of 1.15 hours. In the LARGO study,18 it ac-
counted for 21% of a total 1.08-hour increase for 1 mg of
rasagiline and 17% of a total 1.03-hour increase for entaca-
pone. In the present trial, the safinamide CGI outcome was
–0.44 vs placebo (Table 2). In the PRESTO study, it was –0.68
for 0.5 mg of rasagiline and –0.39 for 1.0 mg of rasagiline,17 and
in the LARGO study, it was –0.49 for 1.0 mg of rasagiline and
–0.36 for entacapone.18

come measures, including daily on time without troublesome
dyskinesia, daily off time, UPDRS Part III score, and PDQ-39
score.20
In the present trial, nondiary measures of dyskinesia in the
safinamide group revealed either no change (DRS score) or a
small increase of nominal significance (UPDRS Part IV dyski-
nesia subscores). As a TEAE, dyskinesia was reported more fre-
quently with safinamide than with placebo. Its incidence
(14.6% during 24 weeks vs 5.5% for placebo) resembled that
reportedforrasagilineinpatientswithfluctuatingPD(18%dur-
ing 26 weeks vs 10% for placebo17). In the previous safin-
amide trial, there was no apparent association between dos-
age and the frequency of dyskinesias, which was 21.1% for 50
mg/d and 18.3% for 100 mg/d compared with 12.6% for pla-
cebo at 24 weeks19 and 31.2% for 50 mg/d and 27.8% for 100
mg/d compared with 21.7% for placebo at 2 years.20 In both
studies,19,20 safinamide was generally well tolerated, as indi-
cated by high study completion rates (approximately 89% in
the present trial) and low rates of safinamide treatment dis-
continuation attributable to TEAEs (approximately 5% in the
present trial).

Limitations
Limitations to the interpretation of the present study’
s out-
comes include the study’
s duration of 24 weeks and its test-
ing of only 1 prespecified dosage level (100 mg). The study also
didnotobtainovernightdiarydataanddidnotanalyzethedata
from the first day of each 3-day diary-keeping period.
Conclusions
The management of motor complications in PD remains a sig-
nificant challenge in which all available pharmacologic
options carry the risk of inducing or exacerbating dyskinesias.2
In the present study, safinamide increased on time and de-
creased off time to levels comparable to those seen for MAO-B
and COMT inhibitors and had a low risk of inducing or exacer-
bating dyskinesia categorized as troublesome. For safinamide,
theseeffectsmayberelatedtodopaminergicandnondopamin-
ergic drug actions. It is notable that in a nonprimate model of
levodopa-induced dyskinesias, safinamide reduced the inten-
sity and duration of dyskinesias and also prolonged the motor
benefits of levodopa.21 Despite this study’
s limitations, it pro-
vides evidence that supports safinamide as an effective once-
daily adjunct to levodopa for fluctuating PD. We anticipate that
the results are generalizable across the PD population and sug-
gest that safinamide offers an additional option for the control
of motor fluctuations by oral medication before considering
infusion therapies or deep brain stimulation.
