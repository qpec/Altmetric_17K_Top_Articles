Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) can currently
predict a subset of submicroscopic abnormalities associated with severe clinical manifestations.
We retrospectively analyzed the performance of SNP-based NIPT in 80 449 referrals for
22q11.2 deletion syndrome and 42 326 referrals for 1p36, cri-du-chat, Prader-Willi, and Angel-
man microdeletion syndromes over a 1-year period, and compared the original screening proto-
col with a revision that reflexively sequenced high-risk calls at a higher depth of read. The
prevalence of these microdeletion syndromes was also estimated in the referral population.
The positive predictive value of the original test was 15.7% for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,
and 5.2% for the other 4 disorders combined. With the revised protocol, these values increased
to 44.2% for 22q11.2 and 31.7% for the others. The 0.33% false-positive rate (FPR) for
22q11.2 deletion syndrome decreased to 0.07% with the revised protocol. Similarly, the FPR
for the other 4 disorders combined decreased from 0.56% to 0.07%. Minimal prevalences were
estimated to be 1 in 1255 for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and 1 in 1464 for 1p36, cri-du-chat,
and Angelman syndromes combined. Our results show that these microdeletions are relatively
common in the referral population, and that the performance of SNP-based NIPT is improved
with high-depth resequencing.

INTRODUCTION
Commonly encountered fetal chromosomal abnormalities include both
whole-chromosome aneuploidies, such as Down syndrome (trisomy
21), and submicroscopic anomalies.1 The latter include copy-number
variants (CNVs) <10 Mb (microdeletions and microduplications) that
may be associated with clinically significant phenotypes.1–3 Such
CNVs are found in approximately 1% of pregnancies undergoing
amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS).4 The most common
microdeletion is at 22q11.2, with a population prevalence between
1 in 3000 and 1 in 6000;5–8 recent reports indicate the rate may
exceed 1 in 1000 in the prenatal population.4,9 As microdeletions are
not thought to be correlated with maternal age,9 the most common
may have a frequency comparable to that of Down syndrome in the
pregnancies of younger women.
Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) is the preferred diag-
nostic tool used to detect submicroscopic CNVs.10 CMA is recom-
mended for fetuses undergoing invasive prenatal testing after major
structural abnormalities are detected by ultrasound, and is an option
for any pregnant woman undergoing amniocentesis or CVS.11,12
However, because CMA requires invasive procedures that carry a risk
Kimberly Martin and Sushma Iyengar contributed equally to this study.

 of fetal loss to obtain fetal cells for analysis,13 or because it may iden-
tify CNVs of uncertain clinical significance, some women may decline
CMA. Analysis of cell-free DNA in maternal plasma potentially offers
an alternative, non-invasive prenatal-testing path toward the identifi-
cation of targeted microdeletions; only women found to be at high-
risk need to be offered invasive testing.4,14–17
Currently,
single-nucleotide
polymorphism
(SNP)-based
non-
invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) can screen for 5 clinically significant
microdeletions1—22q11.2,18 1p36,19 cri-du-chat (5p15.3),20 Prader-
Willi (paternal 15q11-q13),21,22 and Angelman (maternal 15q11-
q13).21 Previous analysis of a cohort of nearly 22 000 women
referred for screening for the 22q11.2 deletion demonstrated a 0.5%
screen-positive rate (SPR) and an 18% positive predictive value
(PPV).23 Here, we report for the first time the screening performance
of this SNP-based NIPT for 1p36, cri-du-chat, Prader-Willi, and
Angelman microdeletion syndromes. We also update our clinical
experience in screening for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome to now
include over 80 000 referrals.23
Earlier studies indicated that reflex sequencing of high-risk
microdeletion test results at a higher depth of read (HDOR) may sub-
stantially reduce the false-positive rate (FPR).17,24 In this study, we
assess the screening performance of this modification, combined with
a higher quality-control confidence threshold. We compare the per-
formance of the original and revised protocols, and use these results
to estimate the prevalence of the 5 microdeletions in the test
population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1
| Study period and cohorts
A SNP-based NIPT screen for fetal chromosome abnormalities was
offered clinically for the 22q11.2 deletion, or for all 5 deletions. A ret-
rospective analysis of test performance was carried out for 80 449
referrals received for microdeletion screening, of which 42 326 were
screened for all 5 deletions and the remainder were screened only
for the 22q11.2 deletion, between February 19, 2014 and February
18, 2015. The 22q11.2 screening cohort reported in this study
included 21 948 cases (received between February 19, 2014, and
August 18, 2014) that were reported previously (Table S1, Supporting
Information).23
For each maternal blood sample, the maternal date of birth,
maternal weight, gestational age, reason for testing, and informed
consent were collected. Test-interpretation information, guidance on
confirmatory testing options, genetic counseling, and disease-specific
literature were available to test providers and patients.
2.2
| SNP-based analysis
Samples were analyzed at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act-
certified, College of American Pathologists-accredited laboratory
using previously described methodology.4,23 Briefly, samples were
screened for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y aneuploidy, and
samples that received a low- or high-risk call for aneuploidy screen-
ing (ie, excluding samples that did not receive a test result)
underwent multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification
for the selected microdeletions. This amplification covered 672 SNPs
within a 2.91 Mb section of the 22q11.2 region that is deleted in
approximately 87% of individuals diagnosed with 22q11.2 deletion
syndrome, and 1152 SNPs in each of the following: a 10 Mb region
deleted in approximately 60% of patients diagnosed with 1p36 dele-
tion syndrome, a 20 Mb region deleted in approximately 65% of
patients diagnosed with cri-du-chat syndrome, and a 5.85 Mb region
deleted in approximately 28% of patients diagnosed with Prader-
Willi/Angelman syndromes.4 Amplified samples were sequenced to
≥3.2 million reads/sample. Deletions in each region were predicted
using an algorithm that calculates and reports the maximum likeli-
hood copy number for the region based on the allele-distribution
pattern of the amplified SNPs, along with a confidence value that
describes how well the data for the sample fits the expected data
profile for the copy-number hypothesis.25,26
2.3
| Definitions of risk
For the 22q11.2 deletion, samples with ≥90% confidence for the
deletion at either allele were reported as “high-risk”; those with
≥90% confidence for no 22q11.2 deletion at both alleles were
reported as “low-risk”; those with lower confidence values at the
maternal allele were analyzed for paternal allele only; and those
with lower confidence values at both alleles were reported as “risk
unchanged.” For the other microdeletion syndromes, samples with
≥80% confidence for a deletion were reported as “high-risk”; those
with lower confidence values at the maternal allele were analyzed
for paternal allele only; and those with lower confidence values at
both alleles were reported as “risk unchanged.” The reported risk
status for each microdeletion syndrome was accompanied by a
numerical estimate of fetal risk based on the population birth preva-
lence of the syndrome and the SNP analysis, and whether 1 or both
alleles were successfully analyzed (Table S2).4 Cases in which a
maternal deletion was suspected were assigned a fetal risk score of
50%. For cases with fetal fractions <6% (22q11.2 deletion) or <7%
(other microdeletions) the reported numerical risk reflected analysis
of only the paternal allele. Cases with >25% maternal or fetal haplo-
blocks (genomic regions with identical genotypes on homologous
chromosomes) on autosomal chromosomes are reported as 'risk
unchanged.
For 22q, any contiguous loss of heterozygosity involving >80%
of the region was reported as “high-risk.” For other genomic regions,
the full region was required to show loss of heterozygosity to be
reported as “high-risk.”
2.4
| Pregnancy follow-up
Follow-up information, including results of ultrasound examinations
performed either prior to, or following NIPT, was requested from pro-
viders for all high-risk cases via phone or email. If the initial outreach
while the pregnancy was ongoing was uninformative, at least 2 more
attempts were made after the estimated delivery date. A de-
identified copy of the genetic testing report was requested whenever
294
MARTIN ET AL.
 diagnostic testing was performed. Providers were also requested to
report false-negative results.
Cases identified as high-risk by NIPT were categorized as true
positive (TP) or false positive (FP) based on the results of confirma-
tory diagnostic testing (CMA, fluorescence in situ hybridization, or
methylation analysis for the 15q region). Samples without follow-up
information, either because the patient did not have any additional
testing or because there was no follow-up information available, were
classified as “unknown” outcome.
2.5
| Performance metrics
The PPV, SPR, and FPR were calculated for each deletion syndrome
and for combinations of syndromes. PPV = number of TPs/number
of (TPs + FPs). Upper and lower boundary PPV values were calcu-
lated by assuming all unknown cases were either all TP or all FP,
respectively. SPR = number of fetal high - risk results/number of
cases that received a high-/low-risk result. FPR = unaffected high -
risk calls/all unaffected cases. The FPR was estimated by assuming
that the ratio of FPs to TPs for cases without diagnostic confirmation
was equal to that for cases with diagnostic confirmation. For combi-
nations of microdeletion syndromes, the number of TP, FP and
unknown outcome cases were based on a proportionate prorating of
the numbers for each individual disorder to allow for the different
numbers of test calls. The SPR and FPR for combinations of syn-
dromes were the sums of the individual syndrome rates. For PPV and
FPR, the upper and lower limits were calculated for the boundary
conditions in which all unknown cases were TP or FP, respectively.
2.6
| Post-hoc analysis
Post-hoc analysis of test performance was performed in an internally
blinded manner using a revised protocol with a higher (95%) confi-
dence threshold for reporting a case as high-risk for a microdeletion,
and reflex sequencing of high-risk cases at HDOR (≥6 million reads/
sample).23,24 Because the presence or absence of deletions on the
paternally inherited chromosome are readily discerned at normal
depth of read, only cases with a suspected deletion on the maternally
inherited chromosome were reflexed to HDOR. To allow for cases
without post-hoc analysis results (due to samples being unavailable
for re-sequencing) in the estimation of PPV, SPR, and FPR for the
revised protocol, a proportionate adjustment was made to the total
number of cases tested.
2.7
| Estimation of disease prevalence in the study
population
The prevalence of each microdeletion syndrome in the population
was calculated as: number of affected pregnancies/(number of cases
with a test result × percentage of syndromic deletions expected to be
captured by test), where the numerator is the sum of the number of
known TPs, the expected number of affected cases in the group with
an unconfirmed outcome, and the number of known false negative
cases. Prevalence was calculated using only cases for which both
maternally and paternally inherited alleles could be analyzed. For
these estimates, it was assumed that the proportion of affected cases
among samples with unknown outcome was equal to that of cases
with known outcome.

RESULTS
3.1
| Referrals
A total of 80 449 referrals were received for microdeletion screening
during the study period, of which 42 326 were for the full panel of
microdeletion syndromes and the remainder were limited to testing
for the 22q11.2 deletion (Figure 1 and Table S1).23 Because microde-
letion screening was only performed when aneuploidy screening could
be successfully completed, 5511 cases were ineligible for microdele-
tion screening for reasons including test canceled, draw <9 weeks GA,
insufficient blood volume, contamination, multiple gestations, and low
fetal fraction (Table S3). Of the 74 938 cases eligible for 22q11.2
deletion testing, 39 678 were referred for screening all 5 microdele-
tions. Characteristics for all cases screened for microdeletions are
summarized in Table 1.

22q11.2 deletion
Of the 74 938 eligible referrals, 283 cases (0.38%) received a high-
risk result for a fetal deletion, 71 841 cases (95.9%) received a low-
risk result, and 2808 cases (3.8%) received a risk-unchanged result
(Table 2 and Figure 1). An additional 6 cases received a high-risk
result due to a suspected maternal deletion. Of the 283 cases identi-
fied as being at high-risk for a fetal microdeletion, follow-up informa-
tion on copy-number truth was available for 153 (54.1%) cases (via
invasive diagnostic testing, n = 117; postnatal diagnostic testing,
n = 32; or post-miscarriage products-of-conception testing, n = 4).
Twenty-four (8.5%) of the high-risk results were TP (Table S4) and
129 (45.6%) were FP (Table 3).

1p36, cri-du-chat, Prader-Willi and Angelman
microdeletions
A total of 39 678 samples were screened for all 4 microdeletions,
with varying numbers of high-risk, low-risk, and risk-unchanged cases
obtained for each microdeletion (Table 2 and Figure 1). Considering
the 4 microdeletions together, there were 215 high-risk calls of which
7 were TP, 117 were FP and 91 had unknown outcome (results for
each microdeletion and for the combination of deletions are in
Table 3). Truth was established on the basis of invasive diagnostic
testing (118 cases), postnatal diagnostic testing (5 cases), or post-
miscarriage products-of-conception testing (1 case). Additional details
of the 7 TPs are in Table S4. One false-negative case was reported
(for cri-du-chat syndrome).

 3.3
| Maternal deletions
Of the 74 938 total cases screened (whether for 22q11.2 deletion
alone or for all 5 microdeletions), a fetal risk score of 50% was
assigned in 6 cases due to suspected deletions in the 22q11.2 region
in the mother; no case had suspected maternal deletions in any of
the other interrogated regions. Follow-up information was available
for 3 of these 6 cases. In 2 cases, a maternal deletion of the 22q11.2
region was confirmed, but fetal copy number was not provided. In
the third case, a fetal deletion was confirmed, and although the
mother's copy number for the 22q11.2 region was not assessed, she
had tetralogy of Fallot and learning disabilities, both of which are
associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.
3.4
| Performance based on presence or absence of
ultrasound abnormalities
Test performance was compared for high-risk calls with, and without,
major fetal structural abnormalities detected by ultrasound prior to
NIPT (Table 4). Of the 498 cases determined to be high-risk for a
fetal deletion by NIPT, 297 (59.6%) had information available about
the presence/absence of ultrasound findings and 201 (40.4%) did
not. Fifty-one of these cases had major fetal ultrasound anomalies
present (Table S5), of which 37 had abnormalities detected prior to
NIPT. However, 260 cases had no reported ultrasound abnormalities
at the time of NIPT; this includes 14 cases for which ultrasound infor-
mation became available after NIPT testing was performed. As
expected, PPVs were higher in cases with abnormal ultrasound find-
ings identified prior to NIPT (Table 4). Most TP cases (80.6%; 25/31)
had major ultrasound anomalies; 71% (22/31) had ultrasound anoma-
lies that were detected prior to NIPT screening (Tables S3 and S4). In
contrast, approximately 4.5% of FP cases (11/246) and 5.9% of
unknown outcome cases (13/221) were reported to have major ultra-
sound abnormalities.
3.5
| Pregnancy outcomes for high-risk calls
Information regarding use of invasive testing was available for 84.5%
(239/283) cases that were determined to be high-risk for a fetal 22q
deletion; 49% (117/239) had invasive testing and 51% (122/239) did
not. For the other 4 microdeletions combined, this information was
available for 81.9% (176/215) of cases that were determined to be
high-risk for a fetal microdeletion; 64.8% (114/176) had invasive test-
ing and 35.2% (62/176) did not.
Post-NIPT pregnancy outcome information was available for
66.5% (331/498) of cases determined to have high-risk for a fetal
microdeletion by the assay. Of these, 89% (295/331) of pregnancies
were continued, 4% (14/331) miscarried, and 7% (22/331) were ter-
minated. Among confirmed TPs, 22.6% (7/31) reported terminations.
Fifteen other cases reported terminations: 7 were FP, and 8 had
unknown microdeletion status. Of the 7 FP, 4 had ultrasound anoma-
lies detected after NIPT screening, 1 had no ultrasound anomalies,
and 2 had no information available about presence/absence of ultra-
sound findings. The latter 3 cases and 1 of the cases with ultrasound
anomalies were additionally reported to be at high-risk for trisomy
21 (n = 3) or trisomy 18 (n = 1). Of the 8 cases with unknown micro-
deletion status, 2 had ultrasound findings prior to NIPT. Pregnancy

 (n = 209) were as follows: 188 (90%) were continued, 7 (3%) miscar-
ried, and 14 (7%) were terminated.
3.6
| Prevalence of microdeletions
In this study, the estimated prevalence of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome
was 1 in 1255, and those for the 1p36 deletion, cri-du-chat, and Angel-
man syndromes ranged from 1 in 3624 to 5820 (Figure 2). The preva-
lence of Prader-Willi syndrome was not estimated due to lack of a TP
case. The combined estimated prevalence of 1p36, cri-du-chat, and
Angelman microdeletions in this cohort was 1 in 1464, and for all 5 dis-
orders combined it was 1 in 676. Details of the calculations for preva-
lence are presented in Appendix S1. Because there may have been
additional false negative cases that did not come to attention, these
prevalence rates are minimal estimates.

| Post-hoc analysis
3.7.1
|
22q11.2 deletion
The revised protocol was applied to 268 (24 TP, 121 FP, and
123 unknown) of the 283 cases (94.7%) that were determined to have a
high-risk call for 22q11.2 deletion using the original protocol (the
remaining cases were unavailable for analysis; Figure 1). Of the 121 FP
cases, 92 (76.0%) were reclassified as low-risk with the revised protocol.
Conversely, for the known TP, 23 of 24 remained high-risk, a drop in
detection rate of 4.2%. Of the 123 cases with unknown outcome,
88 (71.5%) were reclassified as low-risk, consistent with the assumption
that these cases were a proportionate mixture of TP and FP cases
(Appendix S2). Overall, there was a 67.2% (180/268) reduction in high-
risk calls. Based on these findings, the SPR for the revised protocol was
0.13% (vs 0.39% with the original protocol), the PPV was 44.2%
(vs 15.7% with the original protocol) and the FPR was 0.07% (vs 0.33%
with the original protocol; Table 5).

together (n = 215), the revised protocol was applied to 209 (7 TP,
114 FP, and 88 unknown) cases (97.2%) determined to be high-risk

 with the original protocol (the remaining cases were unavailable for
analysis; Figure 1). Known FP results were reduced by 86.8%
(99/114), all 7 TP remained high-risk calls, and there was a propor-
tionate 83.0% (73/88) reduction in the high-risk calls for cases with
unknown outcome. The revised protocol therefore had a SPR of
0.10% (vs 0.59% with the original protocol), a PPV of 31.7% (vs 5.2%

DISCUSSION
This study extends our initial report23 of the clinical experience of a
SNP-based NIPT for the prediction of 22q11.2 deletions to include
6 additional months of screening for the 22q11.2 deletion, and data for
4 additional microdeletion syndromes: 1p36, cri-du-chat, Angelman, and
Prader-Willi. The results show that 22q11.2, 1p36, cri-du-chat, and
Angelman microdeletions are relatively common in the referral popula-
tion, with a combined minimum estimated prevalence of 1 in 676. The
performance of the original screening protocol for 22q11.2 deletion
syndrome in this cohort is similar to that demonstrated previously.4,23
We also show that applying a stricter quality-control confidence thresh-
old and reflexively sequencing high-risk samples to a HDOR with the
revised screening protocol reduced FPRs and increased PPVs substan-
tially. As a result of these performance improvements, the revised pro-
tocol has been implemented commercially.
Our initial study indicated that screening for 22q11.2 deletion syn-
drome using the original protocol would be associated with a 0.38%
FPR, an 18.0% PPV, and a prevalence of 1 in 962 in the test popula-
tion.23 In this study, with the original protocol, the FPR was 0.33%, the
PPV was 15.7%, and the estimated prevalence was 1 in 1255. With a
revised protocol, performance improved to a projected 0.07% FPR and
44.2% PPV. The revised protocol also exhibited relatively high PPVs for
the other 4 microdeletion syndromes, although these had larger confi-
dence intervals (Table 5). Because microdeletions are less prevalent than
aneuploidies in NIPT cohorts, the PPVs for screening microdeletions are
expected to be lower than those observed for aneuploidy.15,17 In fact,
observed PPVs for microdeletions using the updated protocol are lower
than reported NIPT PPVs for trisomy 18 and trisomy 21, and similar to
those for trisomy 13 and monosomy X.15,27,28 Moreover, the PPVs we
observed are similar to, or better than, those observed with conven-
tional maternal serum screening for trisomies—a bar that has been con-
sidered sufficient to justify routine use.
Prior publications have questioned the use of NIPT as a screen-
ing test for microdeletions, citing concerns about high FPRs, low sen-
sitivities,
and
challenges
associated
with
variants
of
unknown
significance.29,30 However, these reports focused on whole-genome
sequencing approaches that employ counting-based methodologies.
By concentrating on specific genomic regions with clinically signifi-
cant deletions, the targeted nature of the SNP-based method over-
comes many of the limitations discussed in these publications.31
Furthermore, comparison of detection rates for confirmed microdele-
tions in clinical cohorts and ratios of maternally inherited vs de novo
deletions to published ratios suggests that SNP-based methods have
substantially higher sensitivity than counting-based methods.32–34
In this study, the observed FPR for Angelman syndrome (conveyed
by the maternally inherited chromosome 15q11-13 region) was substan-
tially higher than that for Prader-Willi syndrome (conveyed by the same

 region on paternally inherited chromosome 15). This is because paternally
inherited SNPs in the fetal genome not shared with the mother are easier
to detect at lower fetal fractions. In contrast, fetal cell-free DNA from the
maternally inherited homolog is diluted by the large amount of identical
maternal cell-free DNA found in the plasma, making detection of maternal
allele deletions more difficult. For the other microdeletions, variation in
the FPRs may be explained by the different number of SNPs targeted in
each deletion region, different average rates of heterozygosity of the tar-
geted SNPs (resulting in variation in the distributions of informative SNPs),
and statistical variation.
This study has a number of limitations. First, this is a clinically derived
cohort and the patients who were selected for testing may not reflect a
general obstetrical population (ie, the referral population may have been
enriched for cases with a high a priori risk for a microdeletion). This was
evidenced by the high percentage of TP cases with ultrasound abnormal-
ities identified prior to performing NIPT (Table S5). When we estimated
the PPVs for the subset of the cohort without any abnormal ultrasound
findings prior to NIPT, we found lower PPVs, as expected. We recalcu-
lated the PPVs to adjust for differences in prevalence and found that the
test continued to show good performance in low prevalence populations
(Appendix S3 and Table S6). Second, we were unable to obtain follow-up
data for 44% of cases in this study despite considerable efforts to gather
this information. To address this issue, we calculated PPV boundary
values, assuming all cases with unknown outcome were either all TP or all
FP (Tables 3 and 5). These data indicate that even in the unlikely event
that all cases with unknown outcomes are FPs, the SNP-based NIPT with
the revised protocol retains PPVs similar to the performance of NIPT for
trisomy 13 and monosomy X, and greater than that of maternal serum
screening. Moreover, comparison of the original and revised protocols
demonstrated no significant bias toward unaffected pregnancies in cases
for which outcome information was not available (Appendix S2). Third,
because we did not collect follow-up information for low-risk cases, we
were unable to estimate the sensitivity or the negative predictive value of
the screening test. Establishing an accurate estimate of the detection rate
is highly desirable, but not possible in a cohort where a significant number
of cases have unknown follow-up. Fourth, our estimates of prevalence
can only be considered minimum estimates, and with no identifiable TPs
for Prader-Willi syndrome in the cohort, we were unable to estimate the
prevalence of this disorder. Given the low prevalence of Prader-Willi syn-
drome caused by a deletion,4,35 absence of a TP is not surprising in a
cohort of this size. Finally, although the revised protocol greatly reduced
FPRs, the detection rate was also slightly reduced; 1 TP for the 22q11.2
deletion that was correctly called as high-risk by the original protocol, was
incorrectly reclassified as low-risk by the revised protocol.
This study extends previous work23 demonstrating that prenatal
screening for the 22q11.2 deletion can be effectively performed via a
SNP-based NIPT. In this study, the combined estimated prevalence for the
set of microdeletion disorders in the screened population (1/676)
exceeded that of Down syndrome in younger women,36 and also that of
open neural-tube defects in the US population (1/1886).37 Additionally,
PPVs and FPRs of SNP-based screening appeared to be superior to those
of traditional screening methods offered to screen for Down syndrome38
and open neural-tube defects.39 The observed prevalences and test per-
formance therefore exceed that of other prenatal screening tests long
considered standard of care. Consistent with recent American College of
Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines,40 our findings support offer-
ing microdeletion screening as an adjunct to existing NIPT to refine risks
for these 5 clinically significant, well-characterized genetic disorders.
