ABSTRACT 
 
“Liquid biopsy” approaches analyzing cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from the blood of 
patients with cancer are increasingly utilized in clinical practice. However, it is not 
yet known whether cfDNA sequencing from large cohorts of patients with cancer can detect genomic 
alterations at frequencies similar to those observed by direct tumor sequencing, and whether this 
approach can generate novel insights. Here, we report next-generation sequencing data from cfDNA of 
1,397 patients with colorectal cancer. Overall, frequencies of genomic alterations detected in cfDNA 
were comparable to those observed in three independent tissue-based colorectal cancer sequenc-
ing compendia. Our analysis also identifi
 ed a novel cluster of extracellular domain (ECD) mutations 
in  
EGFR 
, mediating resistance by blocking binding of anti-EGFR antibodies. Patients with  
EGFR 
 ECD 
mutations displayed striking tumor heterogeneity, with 91% harboring multiple distinct resistance 
alterations (range, 1–13; median, 4). These results suggest that cfDNA profi
 ling can effectively defi
 ne 
the genomic landscape of cancer and yield important biological insights. 
 
SIGNIFICANCE: 
 This study provides one of the fi
 rst examples of how large-scale genomic profi
 ling of 
cfDNA from patients with colorectal cancer can detect genomic alterations at frequencies comparable 
to those observed by direct tumor sequencing. Sequencing of cfDNA also generated insights into tumor 
heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance and identifi
 ed novel  
EGFR 
 ectodomain mutations.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumor tissue speci-
mens from large patient cohorts has led to major advances 
in elucidating the genomic landscape of cancer. Despite 
the many benefi
 ts and therapeutic insights offered by this 
approach, large-scale genomic profi
 ling through tissue-based 
sequencing methods is not without limitations. Importantly, 
to be suitable for sequencing, tissue samples must be of 
Research.

adequate quantity and must possess a sufficient percentage 
of tumor cells among a background of normal cells and 
stroma. Although many surgical resection specimens are of 
suitable quality, needle-based biopsy samples from meta-
static lesions often yield insufficient tumor cells to produce 
robust sequencing data (1, 2). As a result, many tumor tissue 
sequencing databases are derived from earlier-stage, largely 
untreated cancers, as opposed to tumors from patients with 
metastatic disease, where small biopsies are typically per-
formed (3, 4). Thus, tissue-based sequencing compendia may 
not accurately represent the genomic landscape and biology 
of advanced cancers.
With the recent increase in clinical cell-free DNA (cfDNA) 
testing, large cfDNA-based sequencing databases could rep-
resent an attractive resource for genomic studies. However, 
it is not yet known whether the genomic landscape defined 
by population-based cfDNA sequencing accurately reflects the 
genomic landscape of mutations identified in large tissue-based 
sequencing studies. cfDNA represents DNA present in the non-
cellular portion of blood that originates from either normal 
tissue or tumor sources. The tumor-derived portion of cfDNA 
is termed circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and represents DNA 
that is shed into the bloodstream by tumor cells throughout 
the body. cfDNA testing offers access to tumor DNA, regard-
less of whether a surgery or biopsy is clinically indicated, thus 
protecting patients with metastatic disease from potential com-
plications of an invasive procedure. Furthermore, as cfDNA can 
be shed into the blood from multiple lesions in an individual 
patient, it can offer an anatomically unbiased sampling of pri-
mary and metastatic tumor lesions, thereby generating insights 
into intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity (5–12). Therefore, 
understanding the key similarities and differences between 
cfDNA and tissue-based tumor databases would be informa-
tive in determining whether large-scale cfDNA profiling might 
represent an effective and efficient approach to define the muta-
tional landscape of specific cancer types.
Here, we report results from clinical cfDNA testing of 1,397 
deidentified individual patients with advanced colorectal can-
cer and compare these results to three independent large-scale 
tissue-based sequencing databases. We find that cfDNA profil-
ing detects genomic alterations at frequencies comparable to 
those previously reported by direct tumor sequencing. Our 
findings also reveal how analysis of large cfDNA sequencing 
databases can provide novel and clinically relevant insights 
into tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance.
RESULTS
Comparison of the Mutational Landscape  
of cfDNA and Tumor Tissue
To assess the potential utility of a large cfDNA sequencing 
database, we analyzed 1,772 consecutive blood specimens 
from patients with colorectal cancer who underwent testing 
with a targeted NGS assay (Guardant360, Guardant Health) 
between June 1, 2014, and May 18, 2016. There were three 
versions of the assay during the study time period, covering 
54, 68, and 70 genes, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). 
In all, 1,500 cases (85%) had at least one genomic alteration 
detectable in cfDNA. Of these, 103 samples represented 
serial assays from the same patient, leaving 1,397 unique 
patients with genomic data for analysis (Supplementary 
 
Fig. S1).
The prevalence of nonsynonymous single-nucleotide vari-
ants (SNV) detected in cfDNA was compared with those 
observed in three publicly available colorectal cancer tissue-
based databases, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; 
n = 228; ref. 3), the Nurses Health Study/Health Professionals 
Follow-up Study (NHS/HPFS; n = 619; ref. 4), and the AACR 
Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange 
(GENIE; n = 1,149; ref. 13). For consistency, the analysis of 
all cohorts was adjusted to include only those SNVs covered 
by the cfDNA assay. Mutational prevalence was largely con-
sistent among the three tissue cohorts (Fig. 1A), although 
some small differences were observed, which may be due 
to expected statistical variability or to differences in demo-
graphics among the three tissue cohorts. For example, the 
increased prevalence of BRAF mutations in the NHS/HPFS 
cohort is likely due to the increased representation of women 
in this cohort (BRAF mutations are more common in women 
than men with colorectal cancer; Supplementary Table S2). 
Overall, there were striking similarities in mutational preva-
lence between cfDNA and the three tissue-based databases 
(Fig. 1A; Supplementary Table S3). The mutational preva-
lence of the 20 most commonly mutated genes in cfDNA was 
strongly associated with the mutational prevalence in tumor 
tissue (R2 = 0.95; P < 0.0001; Fig. 1B). Still, there were some 
notable differences between cfDNA and tissue. For example, 
EGFR mutations were significantly more common in cfDNA 
(11.2%) than tissue [4.8% for TCGA (P < 0.003); 4.4% for 
NHS/HPFS (P < 0.0001); and 2.9% for GENIE (P < 0.0001), 
by χ2 test; Fig. 1A]. These differences may reflect real biologi-
cal differences between the cfDNA and tissue-based cohorts, 
as patients who received cfDNA profiling were more likely to 
have metastatic disease and to have received prior therapies.
In addition, JAK2V617F mutations were detected in the cfDNA 
of 16 patients, but none of the 1,996 combined colorectal 
cancer specimens profiled from the tissue-based sequencing 
databases (Fig. 1C). The most likely explanation for this dis-
crepancy is that JAK2V617F mutations detected in cfDNA were 
not actually present in the patients’ tumors, but were present 
in a hematopoietic clone of indeterminate clinical potential, 
which is observed in 0.2% of the general population (14). 
Indeed, JAK2V617F mutations are one of the most common 
mutations observed in hematopoietic clones of indeterminate 
clinical potential, and these mutations increase in prevalence 
with age (15). Consistent with this hypothesis, the median 
age for patients with a JAK2V617F mutation detected in cfDNA 
was 73 years, whereas the median age among patients with-
out this mutation was 60 years (P = 0.0006; Fig. 1D). This 
example highlights an important limitation of blood-based 
genomic profiling, in that one cannot be certain that a muta-
tion detected in cfDNA is actually derived from the patient’s 
tumor. Still, these data overall show a remarkably high simi-
larity between cfDNA-based and tissue-based profiling, and as 
a whole support the potential utility and validity of large-scale 
cfDNA genomic profiling approaches.
Comparison of Clonal and Subclonal Mutations
We then evaluated the clonal versus subclonal landscape 
of mutation variants detected in the colorectal cancer cfDNA

cohort. A mutation was defined as “subclonal” if the mutant 
allele frequency (MAF) was less than 25% of the highest MAF 
in the sample and was defined as “clonal” if it was above this 
threshold. At least one subclonal mutation was found in 51% of 
patients (range of 1 to 54 subclonal mutations). Among the 20 
genes with the highest mutational prevalence in cfDNA, the six 
genes most likely to be clonal (in order of most to least clonal) 
include KRAS, FBXW7, APC, SMAD4, BRAF, and TP53 (Fig. 2A), 
all of which are known to play early and critical roles in the 
oncogenesis of colorectal cancer. Furthermore, clonal SNVs were 
significantly more likely to represent mutations predicted to be 
activating or inactivating truncal driver mutations, whereas sub-
clonal SNVs were more likely to be nonfunctioning “passenger” 
mutations or variants of unknown significance [OR, 3.65; 95% 
confidence interval (CI), 3.24–4.10; P < 0.0001; Fig. 2B].
We hypothesized that another class of subclonal muta-
tions could represent nontruncal acquired resistance muta-
tions emerging during prior therapy. Interestingly, EGFR was 
the gene with the highest percentage of subclonal mutations 
(Fig. 2A). When the MAFs of two predominantly clonal 
mutations, KRAS and APC, were compared in individual 
tumors, a linear relationship was observed (Fig. 2C), sug-
gesting that these mutations often coexist as clonal events in 
colorectal cancer, although some subclonal KRAS and APC 
mutations were noted. However, when the MAFs of EGFR 
and APC SNVs were compared, a linear relationship was not 
observed, with most EGFR mutations occurring at subclonal 
frequencies (Fig. 2D). This suggests that the EGFR muta-
tions detected in cfDNA are not likely to be founding clonal 
events in the development of these colorectal cancers, but 
rather are likely to be mutations emerging in specific tumor 
subclones, either as part of the process of tumor progression 
or metastasis, or perhaps in response to the selective pressure 
of anticancer therapies.

Consistent with this latter hypothesis, many of the patients 
with subclonal EGFR mutations harbor specific mutations 
in the extracellular domain (ECD) of EGFR. EGFR ECD 
mutations have been implicated in driving clinical acquired 
resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies, such as cetuximab and 
panitumumab, which are approved for the treatment of KRAS 
and NRAS (RAS) wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (7, 12, 
16–18). Similarly, many of the subclonal KRAS mutations 
observed also occurred in these same patients with EGFR 
ECD mutations (Fig. 2C, red labels). KRAS and NRAS muta-
tions are another common mechanism of acquired resistance 
that can emerge during therapy with anti-EGFR antibodies, 
and prior studies have shown that subclonal RAS and EGFR 
ECD mutations can emerge in the same patient during anti-
EGFR therapy (9, 19). The substantially higher mutation 
prevalence of EGFR mutations in cfDNA compared with 
tissue (Figs. 1A and B) may thus reflect the emergence of 
subclonal resistance mutations, particularly in the setting of 
acquired EGFR antibody resistance.
EGFR ECD Mutations in cfDNA of Patients  
with Colorectal Cancer
To evaluate the potential for large-scale cfDNA sequencing 
to provide clinically relevant insights into therapeutic resist-
ance, we performed a focused analysis on patients with EGFR 
mutations. In total, 85 of 157 patients with EGFR mutations 
had mutations in the ECD (amino acids 1 through 649; 
Fig. 3A). To identify mutations with the greatest likelihood 
of functional relevance, we focused on EGFR ECD mutations 
that were recurrent (observed in more than one patient) in 
this cohort. In total, 58 patients harbored a recurrent EGFR 
ECD mutation, and in 42 patients, these EGFR ECD mutations

occurred in domain III of EGFR (amino acids 334–504), 
which represents the binding epitope of both cetuximab and 
panitumumab (Fig. 3A). Of these 42 patients, all 24 patients 
(57%) with available treatment histories were confirmed to 
have received anti-EGFR antibody treatment prior to blood 
collection for cfDNA analysis, supporting a likely role for 
these mutations in driving therapeutic resistance. Treatment 
histories for the remaining 18 patients were not available.
Analysis of the EGFR ECD mutations from these 42 
patients revealed 23 distinct mutations in 11 amino acids 
in domain III. Seven of these amino acids clustered into two 
regions, Cluster 2 (I462, S464, G465, K467) and Cluster 3 
(K489, I491, S492), previously reported to be associated with 
cetuximab and/or panitumumab resistance (Fig. 3A; refs. 7, 
10, 12, 18). Mutations in two amino acids, F404 and T415, 
were noted in a small percentage of patients and have not 
been previously reported in anti-EGFR antibody resistance. 
However, mutations in two additional amino acids not previ-
ously implicated in anti-EGFR antibody resistance, V441 and 
S442, formed a prominent new cluster (Cluster 1) accounting 
for 25% of all EGFR ECD mutations. The majority of these 
novel but highly recurrent mutations affected V441, with 
V441D and V441G being the most common amino acid 
changes observed.
To explore the hypothesis that V441D and V441G repre-
sent novel mechanisms of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR 
antibodies, we performed molecular modeling to predict 
the effects of these mutations on cetuximab binding to

EGFR. Compared with wild-type EGFR, the V441D muta-
tion introduces a negatively charged residue that is predicted 
to decrease the interaction between cetuximab and EGFR 
(Fig. 3B). Similarly, the V441G mutation is predicted to 
destroy a critical hydrophobic node, decreasing the interac-
tion between cetuximab and EGFR (Fig. 3C). Consistent with 
these models, both the V441D and V441G EGFR mutants 
showed significantly reduced binding of both cetuximab and 
panitumumab, relative to wild-type EGFR (Fig. 3D), support-
ing their role as novel mechanisms of acquired resistance to 
anti-EGFR antibodies.
Heterogeneity of anti-EGFR Antibody Resistance
To further investigate the impact of tumor heterogeneity 
on therapeutic strategies to overcome anti-EGFR antibody 
resistance, we performed an in-depth analysis of the cfDNA 
profiles from the 42 patients with EGFR ECD mutations. 
In addition to EGFR ECD mutations, multiple mechanisms 
of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies that bypass 
the need for EGFR signaling have been previously identified, 
including alterations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1, ERBB2, 
MET, and KIT (5–7, 10–12, 16, 18, 20–25). We observed that in 
91% of patients with EGFR ECD mutations in cfDNA, at least 
one additional cooccurring resistance alteration was also 
detected in cfDNA. On average, these patients harbored 5 dis-
tinct resistance alterations to anti-EGFR antibodies (median 
4), with as many as 13 co-occurring resistance alterations 
being detected in a single patient, indicating a striking degree 
of heterogeneity (Fig. 4A). These co-occurring resistance 
alterations frequently involved multiple functionally distinct 
gene targets with 54 unique alterations noted affecting eight 
different genes. KRAS alterations (including mutations and 
amplifications) were the most common resistance altera-
tions observed, present in 69% of patients. KRAS mutations 
occurred in 62% of patients, with KRASQ61H being the most 
common, observed in 52% of patients. MET amplification, 
NRAS mutations, and KRAS amplification were the next most 
common resistance alterations observed, present in 38%, 33%, 
and 24% of cases, respectively. BRAF and MAP2K1 mutations 
were each present in 9.5% of cases.
The presence of multiple resistance alterations in the 
cfDNA of an individual patient is thought to represent the 
existence of multiple resistant tumor subclones that have 
emerged during therapy, which perhaps reside in different 
metastases throughout the body. Consistent with this model, 
resistance mutations were significantly more likely to be sub-
clonal in patients with multiple concurrent mechanisms of 
resistance compared with patients with only a single mecha-
nism of resistance to anti-EGFR therapy (54.5% vs. 10.0%; 
 
P < 0.0001; OR, 10.81; 95% CI, 7.83–14.93; Supplementary 
Fig. S2). Indeed, we observed that patients with EGFR ECD 
mutations showed an enrichment of subclonal EGFR and 
KRAS mutations relative to the overall cohort (Figs. 2C and D, 
red labels). Our analysis also revealed profound heterogeneity 
occurring in the context of acquired resistance. For exam-
ple, one patient (Fig. 4B, pt #1) harbored 13 distinct resist-
ance alterations, including four EGFR ECD mutations, four 
KRAS mutations, KRAS amplification, two NRAS mutations, 
ERBB2 amplification, and a downstream mutation affect-
ing MEK1 (encoded by MAP2K1). Another patient (Fig. 4B, 
 
pt #8) harbored eight different resistance alterations, includ-
ing two EGFR ECD mutations, as well as MET amplifica-
tion, ERBB2 amplification, KIT amplification, KRASQ61H, and 
BRAF V600E. A third patient (Fig. 4B, pt #12) harbored seven 
different resistance alterations, including two EGFR ECD 
mutations, MET amplification, and KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and 
MAP2K1 mutations. In another patient with serial cfDNA 
analyses and detailed treatment history, multiple resistance 
alterations were observed to emerge during anti-EGFR therapy 
(Supplementary Fig. S3). This degree of heterogeneity and the 
co-occurrence of multiple distinct resistance alterations pre-
sent a daunting challenge for therapeutic strategies designed 
to overcome resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies.
In an effort to overcome acquired resistance, anti-EGFR 
antibody mixtures, such as Sym004 and MM-151, have been 
developed that are capable of binding multiple epitopes on 
EGFR and can thereby overcome the effects of individual 
EGFR ECD resistance mutations. However, these agents may 
not overcome non-ECD resistance alterations that bypass the 
requirement for EGFR signaling via activation at other points 
in the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK pathway. Importantly, of the 42 
patients harboring domain III EGFR ECD mutations identi-
fied in our analysis, 88% harbored at least one additional non-
ECD resistance alteration detectable in cfDNA that would be 
predicted to drive resistance to an EGFR antibody mixture 
alone (Fig. 4C), with an average of 2.9 non-ECD resistance 
alterations per patient (range, 1–9; median, 3).
DISCUSSION
With the growing utilization of clinical cfDNA testing, 
large cfDNA sequencing databases could represent a valuable 
resource for genomic discovery. Here, we present one of the 
first studies assessing whether large-scale genomic profiling 
of cfDNA can accurately reproduce the genomic landscape 
of driver mutations defined by direct tumor tissue sequenc-
ing studies. In our analysis of the cfDNA profiles of 1,397 
patients with colorectal cancer, we find that the spectrum 
and frequency of genomic alterations identified in cfDNA 
demonstrate a striking similarity to results from three large 
colorectal cancer tumor tissue sequencing cohorts. These 
data provide a key proof-of-concept supporting the feasibility 
and validity of large-scale genomic analysis of cfDNA.
Genomic profiling from cfDNA offers potential advantages 
and limitations when compared with tumor tissue–based 
sequencing. One key limitation to tumor tissue sequencing 
is that up to 25% of patients with advanced cancer may have 
insufficient quantity of tissue available for molecular analysis 
(2). In contrast, as peripheral blood can be collected efficiently 
and noninvasively, cfDNA testing can be performed on almost 
any patient, including those with tumor lesions that are dif-
ficult to biopsy. Furthermore, as tumor tissue sequencing 
often relies on archival tissue obtained prior to the develop-
ment of metastatic disease, cfDNA profiling may more readily 
facilitate analysis of patients with metastatic disease and may 
better capture the presence of tumor heterogeneity.
However, cfDNA profiling also has limitations. In this 
dataset, genomic alterations in cfDNA were not detected in 
15% of cases. This result is similar to rates of cfDNA detection 
in other colorectal cancer series (5, 19), and is comparable to 
Research.

 Cell-Free DNA Sequencing in Colorectal Cancer
RESEARCH BRIEF
 
February  2018 CANCER DISCOVERY | 171 
the rate of tissue insufficiency in tissue-based NGS profiling 
(2). Although it is possible that some patients did not have 
alterations in genes covered by the NGS assay, in most cases, 
lack of detection of genomic alterations in cfDNA was likely 
due to other factors, including low tumor burden, lack of 
cfDNA shedding by some tumors, and timing of blood col-
lection (ctDNA is reduced after surgical resection and while 
on active treatment; ref. 26). Optimizing the timing of cfDNA 
testing, for example, prior to initiation of therapy or at the 
time of disease progression, may be an important means of 
increasing the yield of cfDNA testing.
Another limitation of cfDNA profiling highlighted in our 
study is that it is possible for both tumor-derived and non–
tumor-derived genomic alterations to be detected in cfDNA, 
which has the potential to confound analyses (27). For example, 
in our study, JAK2V617F mutations were detected in cfDNA from 
1.1% of patients, but in none of the colorectal cancer cases from 
tissue-based cohorts (Fig. 1C). These JAK2V617F mutations are 
most likely derived from a hematopoietic clone of indeterminate 
clinical potential, which is observed subclinically in the periph-
eral blood in a small percentage of the general population, but 
with increasing prevalence with age (14). Indeed, these muta-
tions were found predominantly in older patients in our cohort 
(Fig. 1D). Similarly, a recent case report identified an IDH2 muta-
tion in cfDNA from a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer 
that was not readily detectable in a matched tumor biopsy. The 
same IDH2 mutation was identified in a bone marrow biopsy, 
supporting that the alteration originated from a hematopoietic 
clone (28). Going forward, methods such as parallel sequencing 
of mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood may help 
to delineate whether specific alterations detected in cfDNA are 
derived from clonal hematopoiesis or tumor (27).
In addition to illustrating the close relationship between 
the genomic landscape of cfDNA and tissue, our study also 
offers unique insights into therapeutic resistance. Because 
tissue-based sequencing compendia rely primarily on early-
stage and treatment-naïve tumors, these databases have gen-
erated limited insights into acquired resistance. Conversely, 
large cfDNA cohorts, which can more readily provide non-
invasive access to patients with advanced disease, may offer 
unique insight into resistance mechanisms emerging under 
the selective pressure of systemic therapies. For example, the 
potential for EGFR ECD mutations to drive resistance to anti-
EGFR antibodies has been documented through cfDNA and 
tumor biopsies from small patient cohorts (7, 10, 12, 16–18). 
These efforts have identified key amino acid mutations that 
drive acquired resistance, including I462, S464, G465, K467 
(Cluster 2) and K489, I491, S492 (Cluster 3; refs. 7, 18). Our 
cfDNA database analysis confirmed the recurrent alteration 
of these previously identified residues, but also identified 
a previously unreported cluster of EGFR ECD mutations 
involving V441 and S442 (Cluster 1) that accounted for 25% 
of all ECD mutations, representing an important and novel 
mechanism of resistance to EGFR blockade.
A key limitation of our study is the lack of clinical annota-
tion for the cfDNA cohort. Indeed, as treatment history was 
not available for some patients with EGFR ECD mutations, it 
is not possible to confirm that all patients had received prior 
anti-EGFR antibody therapy. However, EGFR ECD mutations 
have not been observed in colorectal cancer prior to EGFR 
blockade, and, accordingly, in the 57% of EGFR ECD patients 
with available treatment history, every patient was confirmed 
to have received prior anti-EGFR therapy. Although these fac-
tors support the likelihood that these alterations emerged in 
the setting of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy, the 
absence of paired baseline samples makes this impossible to 
confirm. Still, it is notable that even without detailed clini-
cal data, this analysis was able to generate new insights into 
resistance in colorectal cancer. Collectively, these findings 
demonstrate the potential of large-scale cfDNA profiling as 
a tool for discovery and underscore the potential benefits of 
ongoing academic efforts to create publicly available cfDNA 
databases with clinical annotation for future studies (29).
Our study also provides key insights into the role of tumor 
heterogeneity in the setting of acquired resistance to anti-
EGFR antibodies in colorectal cancer. Previous studies have 
illustrated that multiple, heterogeneous resistance alterations 
can be detected in the cfDNA of individual patients, which 
are thought to represent the existence of multiple resist-
ant tumor subclones, often residing in different metastases 
throughout the body (5, 7, 8, 16, 18, 19, 24). Our study sup-
ports the frequent cooccurrence of multiple resistance altera-
tions in individual patients following EGFR blockade, but 
suggests that the degree of molecular heterogeneity present 
may be even more profound and complex than anticipated. 
Indeed, we observed that patients harbored an average of 5 
unique resistance alterations (median 4), with as many as 13 
distinct resistance alterations observed in a single patient. In 
only 9% of patients was a single resistance alteration detected.
The degree of molecular heterogeneity observed following 
anti-EGFR therapy highlights the difficulty of devising a sin-
gle therapeutic strategy capable of overcoming a broad array 
of resistance mechanisms, particularly as these alterations 
frequently affected multiple functionally distinct targets in 
an individual patient. These findings have profound clinical 
implications for efforts designed to overcome EGFR ECD 
mutations by binding multiple epitopes on EGFR (16, 30, 31). 
Indeed, our results suggest that the percentage of patients who 
harbor EGFR ECD mutations alone may be exceedingly small, 
only 12% in this limited series (Fig. 4C). Therefore, tumor 
heterogeneity at the time of acquired resistance to EGFR 
blockade represents a significant obstacle to the development 
of precision medicine strategies and suggests that therapeutic 
strategies that target a key convergent signaling node capable 
of overcoming the multiplicity of resistant clones present in an 
individual patient may be required (9, 18). Collectively, these 
studies support the potential utility of large-scale cfDNA pro-
filing databases to define the genomic landscape of patients 
with cancer and to provide novel and clinically relevant insights 
into tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance.
METHODS
cfDNA Cohort
A total of 1,772 consecutive blood specimens were analyzed from 
patients with colorectal cancer using the Guardant360 cfDNA assay 
(Guardant Health). The Guardant360 assay is a Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments (CLIA)–certified targeted digital sequenc-
ing panel designed to detect SNVs, as well as selected insertions/ 
deletions, amplifications, and fusions (Supplementary Table S1).

Subjects provided informed, written consent when appropriate. This 
research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Hel-
sinki and was performed with Institutional Review Board approval 
(MDACC LAB09-0373).
Analysis of cfDNA Mutational Prevalence
To determine cfDNA mutational prevalence, we analyzed samples 
in which at least one mutation was detected (N = 1,500). When more 
than one sample was available for the same patient, the most recent 
sample was selected for analysis. The final cfDNA analysis cohort 
included samples from 1,397 unique patients. Mutations consid-
ered in this analysis include SNPs that resulted in protein-coding 
changes (i.e., missense/nonsense). Synonymous, splice site, intron, 
intergenic, and untranslated region variants were not included in 
the prevalence calculation. Insertions/deletions (indels), fusions, and 
amplifications/deletions were also excluded. The primary focus for 
this analysis is on the 20 genes with the highest mutation prevalence.
Analysis of Tissue Mutational Prevalence
To compare cfDNA mutational prevalence to that of tissue-based 
datasets, we obtained sequencing results from three previously 
reported and publicly available tumor tissue cohorts. The TCGA 
cohort consisted of 228 unique cases with tumor and matched 
normal tissue pairs with whole-exome sequencing (WES) from the 
supplement of the original TCGA characterization of colon and rec-
tal cancer (3). The NHS/HPFS cohort included WES of tumor and 
matched normal tissue pairs from 619 untreated colorectal cancers 
(4). The third cohort consisted of colorectal cancer cases from the 
AACR Project GENIE (13). Because profiling techniques differ across 
centers within the AACR Project GENIE, we limited our analysis 
to those centers that analyzed all exons of sequenced genes. This 
allowed prevalence calculations based on gene coverage comparable 
with the Guardant360 assay. The proportions and 99% CIs of specific 
gene mutations were computed for all tissue and cfDNA cohorts. 
Ninety-nine percent confidence intervals for binomial proportions 
were calculated for each gene mutation based on the frequencies and 
numbers of patients studied using the modified Wald method (32). 
CIs were compared descriptively between the cfDNA cohort and each 
tissue-based cohort. Median age was compared between patients 
with and without a JAK2V617F mutation detected in cfDNA using the 
 
t test. Bar charts and scatter plots were used to illustrate the data.
Analysis of Clonal and Subclonal Mutations
The 20 genes with the highest mutation prevalence were analyzed 
for percentage of variants that were either clonal or subclonal. This 
analysis included all nonsynonymous SNV gene variants. In this 
analysis, when serial samples were available for the same patient, the 
sample with the highest MAF was selected as the most representative 
for analysis. A mutation was defined as clonal if the MAF was greater 
than or equal to 25% of the highest MAF in the sample. A mutation 
was defined as “subclonal” if the MAF was less than 25% of the high-
est MAF in the sample.
Analysis of Functional Significance of Alterations
Functional annotation of variants for Fig. 2B was provided by 
the Precision Oncology Decision Support Core at Sheikh Khalifa 
Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Institute for Personalized Cancer Therapy of 
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, 
TX; https://pct.mdanderson.org/). This annotation utilizes a large 
curated database of variants with literature based and in vitro assess-
ment of functional significance (33, 34).
Determination of EGFR Antibody Binding
NIH3T3 cells were obtained from the ATCC (CRL-1658) in 2016 and 
were passaged for less than 6 months after receipt. Full-length human 
EGFR cDNA (Addgene 23935) was mutagenized using the Strata-
gene Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit to produce V441D and V441G 
mutations. EGFR-containing pLenti-puro (Addgene 17452) was used 
to produce virus to infect NIH3T3 cells. Cells were infected with 
empty pLenti plasmid, wild-type EGFR, EGFRV441D, and EGFRV441G, and 
 
analyzed by flow cytometry for antibody binding as performed by 
others (17). Cells were analyzed by Western blot analysis to dem-
onstrate equal levels of EGFR expression. 1 × 106 cells of each type 
were resuspended in 100 μL of 1% BSA in PBS and incubated with 
 
1 μg of either cetuximab or panitumumab for 1 hour at 4°C. Cells were 
washed with 1% BSA in PBS and incubated with 1 μg of anti-human 
PE-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific H10104). 
Cells were washed and subsequently read on an LSRII flow cytometer. 
The antibody binding experiment was performed in triplicate. Molecu-
lar modeling was conducted using the program Insight II (Accelrys).
