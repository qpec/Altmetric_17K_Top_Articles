 Life inside ant colonies is orchestrated with a diverse set of pheromones, but it is not clear how 
17 
ants perceive these social cues. It has been proposed that pheromone perception in ants evolved 
18 
via expansions in the numbers of odorant receptors (ORs) and antennal lobe glomeruli. Here we 
19 
generate the first mutant lines in ants by disrupting orco, a gene required for the function of all 
20 
ORs. We find that orco mutants exhibit severe deficiencies in social behavior and fitness, 
21 
suggesting that they are unable to perceive pheromones. Surprisingly, unlike in Drosophila 
22 
melanogaster, orco mutant ants also lack most of the approximately 500 antennal lobe glomeruli 
23 
found in wild-types. These results illustrate that ORs are essential for ant social organization, and 
24 
raise the possibility that, similar to mammals, receptor function is required for the development 
25 
and/or maintenance of the highly complex olfactory processing areas in the ant brain.

 Ants live in complex societies and display sophisticated social behavior, including reproductive 
28 
division of labor between queens and workers, behavioral division of labor between nurses and 
29 
foragers, the formation of adaptive foraging networks, nestmate vs. non-nestmate discrimination, 
30 
and collective nest construction (David Morgan, 2009; Grüter & Keller, 2016; Richard & Hunt, 
31 
2013; Leonhardt et al., 2016). All of these behaviors are largely mediated via chemical 
32 
communication using a wide range of pheromones (David Morgan, 2009; Grüter & Keller, 2016; 
33 
Richard & Hunt, 2013; Leonhardt et al., 2016). However, the receptor families involved in 
34 
pheromone perception have not been functionally characterized, in part because the complex life 
35 
cycle of ants has hindered the development of functional genetic tools (Schulte et al., 2014; 
36 
Grüter & Keller, 2016; Kohno et al., 2016; Reid & O’Brochta, 2016). In Drosophila, pheromone 
37 
receptors have been identified that belong to multiple insect chemosensory receptor families, 
38 
including odorant receptors (ORs), gustatory receptors (GRs), ionotropic receptors (IRs), and 
39 
pickpocket channels (PPKs) (Kohl et al., 2015). Ants have numbers of GRs, IRs, and PPKs that 
40 
are typical for insects, while their OR repertoire is highly expanded (Zube et al., 2008; C. D. 
41 
Smith et al., 2011; C. R. Smith et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2012; Oxley et al., 2014; McKenzie et 
42 
al., 2016) (Figure 1A and Supplementary Table 1). This raises the possibility that the expansion 
43 
of ORs specifically, rather than chemoreceptors in general, may underlie the evolution of 
44 
complex chemical communication in ants. Ants also have exceedingly large numbers of 
45 
glomeruli in their antennal lobes, which likely mirror their expanded OR gene repertoire 
46 
(McKenzie et al., 2016) (Supplementary Table 1). Insect ORs function as chemosensory 
47 
receptors by forming ligand-gated ion channels through the formation of dimers with the highly-
48 
conserved co-receptor protein Orco (Larsson et al., 2004; Jones et al., 2005; Sato et al., 2008). 
49 
orco null mutants in fruit flies, locusts, mosquitoes, and moths therefore lose OR function and

 show impaired responses to odorants such as food volatiles and sex pheromones  (Asahina et al., 
51 
2008; DeGennaro et al., 2013; Koutroumpa et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016). 
52 
 
53 
To study the role of ORs in ant biology, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9 protocol and created orco 
54 
mutants in the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi (formerly Cerapachys biroi (Borowiec, 2016)), a 
55 
promising genetic model system (Oxley et al., 2014). We confirmed the identity of orco in the O. 
56 
biroi genome (Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Figure 1) and designed and synthesized a 
57 
guide RNA (gRNA) to target orco (Figure 1B). We injected Cas9 and gRNA into 3,291 eggs less 
58 
than 5h of age and produced 42 G0 adults, some of which displayed mutations in at least 97% of 
59 
PCR amplicons of the orco target site (Figure 1C, Supplementary Text). G0 mutations in the 
60 
germline can be inherited by G1s to produce stable modifications to the genome (Reid & 
61 
O’Brochta, 2016). Given that O. biroi reproduces through parthenogenesis (Oxley et al., 2014), 
62 
stable mutant lines can be clonally propagated from individual mutant G1s and subsequent 
63 
generations without the need for crosses. orco loss-of-function mutant lines are thus derived 
64 
from G1 eggs with independent frameshift mutations in both orco alleles. We recovered a 
65 
diverse set of orco mutant lines, including two orcowt/– lines with one frameshift allele and five 
66 
orco–/– lines with two frameshift alleles (Figure 1D). The phenotypes reported below were 
67 
consistent across the two orcowt/– lines and across the five orco–/– lines, respectively. 
68 
Descriptions of the specific lines used in each experiment along with the associated phenotypes 
69 
are given in Supplementary Table 3.

In D. melanogaster, all antennal lobe glomeruli that have been examined remain present in orco 
72 
mutants, implying that OR function is not required for gross antennal lobe morphology (Larsson

 et al., 2004; Chiang et al., 2009). These results contrast strongly with mice, where olfactory 
74 
receptor function and neuronal activity are essential for the formation and maintenance of the 
75 
analogous brain region, the olfactory bulb (Yu et al., 2004). However, D. melanogaster has only 
76 
60 ORs and a similar number of glomeruli, while mice possess over one thousand olfactory 
77 
receptors and glomeruli. This striking difference suggests that highly complex olfactory systems 
78 
must rely on receptor function for their development and/or maintenance. Ants have highly 
79 
expanded numbers of ORs and antennal lobe glomeruli (Zube et al., 2008; Oxley et al., 2014) 
80 
(Supplementary Table 1), raising the possibility that the development and/or maintenance of ant 
81 
antennal lobes may require additional mechanisms to exceed the complexity found in other 
82 
insects. To address whether OR function might be required for the structure of the ant antennal 
83 
lobe, we imaged brains using confocal microscopy, measured antennal lobe volumes and the 
84 
number of glomeruli, and reconstructed antennal lobes in wild-type and orco mutant adults in O. 
85 
biroi and D. melanogaster. We found that the antennal lobes of orco–/– ants measured only one 
86 
third the volume of wild-type and orcowt/– antennal lobes, and approximately 82% of the 
87 
glomeruli were lost (Figure 2A,B and Supplementary Video 1). However, all six glomeruli in the 
88 
T7 cluster of the ant antennal lobe, which is believed to be innervated by olfactory sensory 
89 
neurons that do not express ORs (Nakanishi et al., 2010; McKenzie et al., 2016), were still 
90 
present in orco–/– individuals. No differences were observed in the volume of the protocerebrum, 
91 
mushroom bodies, or central complex relative to wild-types (P = 0.45, 0.17, and 0.20, 
92 
respectively; t-test). In contrast, we detected no significant difference in antennal lobe volumes 
93 
and only minor potential differences in glomerulus numbers between wild-type and orco–/– flies 
94 
(Figure 2C,D, Supplementary Video 1, and Supplementary Text). These results demonstrate that 
95 
development and/or maintenance of ant antennal lobes are indeed dependent on orco function.

 While further experiments are required to describe precisely how this striking phenotype arises, 
97 
we hypothesize that ants, similar to mammals, may employ ORs in the development and/or 
98 
maintenance of antennal lobe glomeruli, possibly allowing them to evolve larger and more 
99 
complex antennal lobes than other insects (Supplementary Table 1). 
100 
 
101 
Based on the general observation that ants are often repelled by the smell of permanent markers, 
102 
we developed a simple assay to test whether orco mutants have compromised chemosensory 
103 
abilities. We found that wild-type and orcowt/– O. biroi are indeed strongly repelled by lines 
104 
drawn with SharpieTM permanent marker, and rarely contact or cross Sharpie lines (Figure 3A-
105 
C). However, we found that orco–/– O. biroi are significantly less repelled by Sharpie (Figure 
106 
3A-C and Supplementary Video 2), implying that orco is required to perceive the odorants that 
107 
cause Sharpie lines to be repulsive. These results suggest that orco mutant ants possess general 
108 
chemosensory deficiencies, similar to orco mutants in other types of insects  (Asahina et al., 
109 
2008; DeGennaro et al., 2013; Koutroumpa et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016). 
110 
 
111 
Pheromone trails are a major feature of chemical communication in many ants, and are important 
112 
for coordinating collective behaviors such as foraging and nest relocation (Zube et al., 2008; 
113 
David Morgan, 2009). To test whether orco influences the ability of O. biroi to follow 
114 
pheromone trails, we set up 5 experimental colonies composed of 12-14 identically-reared G1s 
115 
with wild-type, orcowt/–, and orco–/– genotypes, and individually tagged each ant with color dots 
116 
(Figure 3D). We recorded videos of each colony and used a novel custom-built automated 
117 
behavioral tracking system employing painted color tags (rather than paper barcodes (Mersch et 
118 
al., 2013)) to individually identify the ants and quantify their behavior (Figure 3D,

 Supplementary Figure 2, and Supplementary Videos 3,4). We disturbed each colony at the 
120 
beginning of each video. During the ensuing period of high activity, we created a 2-D histogram, 
121 
or density map, of movement for each ant, and measured the Pearson correlation coefficient of 
122 
this density map with the density map of the other ants in the colony, reasoning that density maps 
123 
would be more highly correlated when ants were following pheromone trails (Figure 3E,F). To 
124 
provide a null expectation, we also compared the density maps of individual ants to a 
125 
randomized density map of other ants in the colony (Figure 3E,F). We found that the density 
126 
maps of individual ants had significantly higher correlations with the density maps of the rest of 
127 
the ants in the colony than with the randomized density maps in wild-type, but not orco–/–, ants 
128 
(Figure 3F; average correlation coefficients were 0.31 versus 0.04 in wild-type and 0.07 versus 
129 
0.02 in orco–/–, respectively). These findings imply that trail following behavior is reduced or 
130 
absent in orco–/– ants, likely because they are unable to perceive chemical pheromone trails.  
131 
 
132 
Nesting behavior, and the formation of aggregations more generally, is a ubiquitous feature of 
133 
social insect biology (Depickere et al., 2004). Immediately upon eclosion, we noticed that some 
134 
G1s did not nest with other ants, but instead showed a wandering phenotype (Figure 3G). In a set 
135 
of 16 G1 colonies, we used this wandering phenotype to identify colonies containing orco–/– ants 
136 
with 100% accuracy (P < 0.001, Fisher exact test, see Methods). To more precisely measure 
137 
nesting behavior in orco mutants, we recorded and analyzed 24 hr videos of each experimental 
138 
colony. We found that wild-type and orcowt/– ants aggregated into tight clusters and exhibited 
139 
little movement outside the cluster, while orco–/– ants frequently exited the cluster and wandered 
140 
around the dish (Figure 3H, Supplementary Video 3). Overall, orco–/– ants spent a significantly 
141 
larger fraction of time without contact with other ants when compared to wild-type and orcowt/–

 ants (Figure 3I). These findings demonstrate that typical nesting behavior is compromised in 
143 
orco–/– ants. This observation is consistent with the idea that orco mutants are unable to perceive 
144 
odorants, such as aggregation pheromones (Bell et al., 1972; Depickere et al., 2004; Li et al., 
145 
2016), that might be involved in nesting behavior. 
146 
 
147 
Finally, we investigated whether orco mutations have an effect on fitness by measuring egg-
148 
laying and survival rates of wild-type and orco mutant ants. We found that orco–/– ants laid 
149 
significantly fewer eggs than wild-types and orcowt/– ants over a two week period (Figure 4A), 
150 
and orco–/– ants exhibited significantly higher mortality than wild-types over a 34 day period 
151 
(Figure 4B). This suggests that the orco mutant phenotype has serious consequences for ant 
152 
fitness (for a discussion of the potential role of off-target effects see Supplementary Text). It is 
153 
possible that these fitness effects result because orco–/– ants are unable to integrate into the 
154 
colony, as wandering behavior and reduced fitness are also seen in wild-type ants that are kept in 
155 
social isolation (Koto et al., 2015). While we observed many striking deficiencies in orco–/– ants, 
156 
it is important to note that these ants are viable, feed, lay eggs, and may still exhibit some typical 
157 
social behaviors. For example, we have observed orco–/– ants groom eggs, touch other ants with 
158 
their antennae, and elicit alarm responses (Supplementary Videos 3,4). Thus, these orco mutants 
159 
will provide an important resource to study the role of ORs in ant biology in the future. 
160 
 
161 
We have demonstrated that orco is crucial for many aspects of ant biology, including antennal 
162 
lobe morphology, individual response to repulsive odorants and pheromones, and fitness. These 
163 
results illustrate the functional significance of the striking expansion of ORs and antennal lobes 
164 
in ants relative to other insects, and imply that the expansion of ORs may have been an important

2011; C. R. Smith et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2012; Oxley et al., 2014; McKenzie et al., 2016) 
167 
(Figure 1A, Supplementary Table 1). Major transitions in evolution require the coordinated 
168 
action of individuals to operate as a functional, higher-level unit (Maynard Smith & Szathmary, 
169 
1997). During the transition from solitary to eusocial living in ants, this coordination was largely 
170 
achieved via pheromones, and our study illustrates some of the dramatic consequences that are 
171 
suffered by individuals deficient in pheromone perception. Importantly, the greatly reduced 
172 
antennal lobes of orco mutant ants suggest that the mechanisms underlying the development 
173 
and/or maintenance of ant olfactory systems differ from D. melanogaster, and could be 
174 
dependent on receptor function as is the case in mammals. These findings also open the 
175 
possibility that ants could serve as complementary models to better understand the evolution and 
176 
development of complex chemosensory systems.

Figure 4: Reduced fitness in orco–/– ants. (A) Eggs laid per day over a two week period by 
239 
orcowt/– and orco–/– ants relative to wild-type average (dotted line). orco–/– ants laid significantly 
240 
fewer eggs than orcowt/– ants. Both orcowt/– and orco–/– ants laid significantly fewer eggs than the 
241 
wild-type average of 0.34 eggs per day. Wild-type data are given as an average, rather than 
242 
individual values, because most ants in each colony were wild-type and it was therefore not 
243 
possible to obtain individual egg-laying rates for wild-type ants (see Methods). (B) Survival of 
244 
identically-reared and age-matched wild-type (n = 42), orcowt/– (n = 7), and orco–/– (n = 13) ants 
245 
over a 34 day period. Survival of orco–/– ants was significantly lower than that of wild-type ants. 
246 
Survival of orcowt/– ants was not statistically tested due to small sample size, but no trend toward 
247 
reduced survival was observed. *P < 0.05; ***P < 0.001; NS: not significant. P values from an

250 
mean egg-laying rate of wild-type ants in this experiment (A) or from a Fisher exact test (B).

Confirmation of the O. biroi orco gene identity 
254 
Candidate orco orthologs for eight insect species were detected as reciprocal best hits 
255 
using phmmer (Eddy, 1998) with D. melanogaster orco (flybase id: FBgn0037324) as the initial 
256 
query sequence (Supplementary Table 2). To confirm orthology, homologs ±50% the length of 
257 
orco were aligned with MAFFT (Katoh & Standley, 2013) using default parameters. This 
258 
alignment was then used to construct a bootstrapped phylogeny with RAxML (Stamatakis, 
259 
2006), providing unambiguous support for a single copy ortholog of orco in O. biroi 
260 
(Supplementary Figure 1). 
261 
 
262 
Design of orco gRNA 
263 
Identification of cut sites and assessment of off-target sites was performed using the 
264 
script cris.py, part of the genomepy package (commit #94cc628), available at 
265 
https://github.com/oxpeter/genomepy. The genomic sequence for O. biroi orco was searched on 
266 
both strands for the CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA) recognition sequence 5’ - N20NGG - 3’ using 
267 
BLASTN (Altschul et al., 1990) and checked for off-target hits using CRISPRseek (Zhu et al., 
268 
2014). We detected no off-target sites with 2 or less mismatches and only one site with 3 
269 
mismatches for our orco gRNA, which is expected to lead to low or no off-target cutting (Fu et 
270 
al., 2013) (see Supplementary Text). 
271 
 
272 
CRISPR reagent preparation 
273 
 
Recombinant Cas9 protein was purchased from PNAbio, and gRNA was synthesized as 
274 
described previously (Kistler et al., 2015). Activity of Cas9 and gRNA was validated using an in-
275 
vitro digestion assay from New England Biolabs. Immediately prior to injection, Cas9 and 
276 
gRNA were mixed in water to produce a solution with 100 ng/µL Cas9 and 10 ng/µL gRNA. 
277 
 
278 
Colony maintenance and egg collection 
279 
 
O. biroi colonies were maintained in circular Petri dishes (50 mm diameter, 9 mm height) 
280 
with a plaster of Paris floor ca. 4 mm thick. Colonies were fed 3 times weekly with fire ant 
281 
(Solenopsis invicta) brood and cleaned and watered at least once per week. Eggs for injections 
282 
were collected from egg-laying units consisting of 70 O. biroi individuals without larvae or 
283 
pupae. Eggs were collected and placed on double-sided tape with the ventral side up on a glass 
284 
slide, and injected into the anterior end (Oxley et al., 2014). Slides were prepared with up to 80 
285 
eggs for injection and ~25 control eggs to validate incubation conditions. For additional 
286 
information about egg collection see Supplementary Text. 
287 
 
288 
Egg injection, incubation, and rearing 
289 
 
Injection needles were prepared as in previous studies (Lobo et al., 2006). Injections were 
290 
performed using an Eppendorf Femtojet with a Narishige micromanipulator. The Femtojet was 
291 
typically set to Pi 1800 hPa and Pc 500 hPa. Needles were broken by gently touching the needle 
292 
against a capillary submerged in halocarbon oil. Alternatively, sharper needles were generated by 
293 
setting the Femtojet to maximum pressure (6000 hPa) and lightly touching the capillary against 
294 
fibers on the tape. Data in this manuscript result from a combination of both methods.   
295 
 
296 
 
Eggs were submerged in a drop of water immediately prior to injection, and dried after 
297 
injection. Eggs were pierced with the needle and injected for 1-2 seconds. Eggs less than 5 hrs

 old were injected, corresponding to a time when eggs are in a syncytial stage of development 
299 
with <100 nuclei (Oxley et al., 2014). We injected 100-300 eggs per day. After injection, eggs 
300 
were incubated in humid plastic boxes prepared with a plaster of Paris floor moistened with 
301 
distilled water. 
302 
 
303 
 
Two O. biroi clonal lines, which are genetically distinguishable at the mitochondrial 
304 
cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene (Kronauer et al., 2012), were used in this study. All 
305 
experimental ants belonged to Line B, while Line A ants were only used as chaperones to raise 
306 
experimental Line B individuals. Experimental ants were reared by placing Line B larvae (G0s) 
307 
or eggs (G1s and subsequent generations) in colonies of 20 Line A chaperones, and chaperones 
308 
were removed once the callows had eclosed. This rearing method results in a small fraction of 
309 
Line A offspring of chaperones in colonies with the G0s and subsequent generations. For this 
310 
reason, all individuals were genotyped following experiments, and Line A individuals were 
311 
removed from all analyses. All experimental colonies in this study had eggs removed twice 
312 
weekly so that adults were maintained without larvae or pupae. All individuals, including those 
313 
that died during experiments, were genotyped (see below) to determine their clonal line, and 
314 
orco amplicons from Line B individuals were sequenced to determine orco genotype. For 
315 
additional information about egg injection, incubation, and rearing see Supplementary Text. 
316 
 
317 
Tagging 
318 
 
All ants in behavioral and fitness experiments (Figures 3,4) were tagged with two color 
319 
dots, one on the thorax and one on the gaster, using uni-Paint markers (models PX-20 or PX-21) 
320 
such that each individual could be identified within the colony (Figure 3D,G). For automated 
321 
behavioral tracking, four colors were used (blue, green, orange and pink) for a total of 16 unique 
322 
combinations. Ants were tagged with a randomly assigned color pair at least 10 days prior to any 
323 
behavioral experiments. Tagged ants had a leg removed for genotyping and sequencing either 
324 
before (Figure 2A,B; Figure 3A-C) or after (Figure 3D-I; Figure 4) experiments. 
325 
 
326 
Genotyping 
327 
 
To distinguish Line A and Line B, eggs and adults were genotyped using PCR of 
328 
mitochondrial CO1 with standard DNA barcode primers (Folmer et al., 1994) followed by a 
329 
restriction digest with MwoI from New England Biolabs. This enzyme cuts the PCR product 
330 
derived from Line B, but not from Line A. 
331 
 
332 
Sequencing 
333 
 
To screen for orco mutations, we designed PCR primers that flanked the orco cut site and 
334 
sequenced the resulting PCR products using Sanger and Illumina sequencing. Primer sequences 
335 
were: F: 
336 
TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGTCCAACTTGCTGTAAATTTGGAT 
337 
R: GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCTCTTCTTGGTCGGCGGTA.    
338 
 
339 
 
Illumina methods followed a previously described protocol (Kistler et al., 2015). Primers 
340 
included tails at the 5’ end (underlined) that were used as adapters to add indices to individual 
341 
samples for Illumina sequencing (Kistler et al., 2015). Sequences were aligned to the orco 
342 
genomic sequence and reads at each base pair that aligned with an insertion or deletion were 
343 
counted with the script crispralign.py from the genomepy package, available at

 https://github.com/oxpeter/genomepy. orco amplicons from 25 of 42 recovered G0s were 
345 
subjected to Illumina sequencing (Figure 1C). Three of these individuals, all of which were 
346 
found to have nearly 100% mutation rates, displayed a wandering phenotype similar to the 
347 
wandering phenotype observed in G1s, indicating that somatic CRISPR in G0s may be useful for 
348 
functional genetic studies even in the many social insect species where it is not logistically 
349 
possible to generate or maintain stable mutant lines (Schulte et al., 2014). 
350 
 
351 
Identification of mutant sequences 
352 
 
Mutant lines were identified via Sanger sequencing of eggs and adults of G1s and 
353 
subsequent generations. All Sanger sequencing traces were scored manually. For the G1 dataset 
354 
(below), manual identifications were verified by checking for misalignment against a reference 
355 
sequence using MEGA (Kumar et al., 2016) and by using the program Mutation Surveyor 
356 
(Softgenetics) for automated allele identification. Mutant lines were defined as groups of ants 
357 
that possess identical orco genotypes, and orco amplicons from representatives of each mutant 
358 
line were Illumina sequenced and individual reads were manually inspected to ensure both 
359 
alleles were properly identified. 
360 
 
361 
Glomerulus counts and antennal lobe volumes 
362 
 
One of the wild-type O. biroi antennal lobe reconstructions was based on published data 
363 
(McKenzie et al., 2016). For the remaining data, D. melanogaster and O. biroi brains were 
364 
dissected in PBS and immediately transferred to a fixative solution of either 1% glutaraldehyde 
365 
or 2% PFA and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS, and fixed at room temperature on a shaker for 1-30 
366 
days. To dehydrate, brains were rinsed in PBS and then suspended for 5 minutes each in an 
367 
ascending series of 50%, 70%, 90%, 95%, 100%, 100%, and 100% ethanol. Brains were cleared 
368 
and mounted in methyl salicylate. Glutaraldehyde-enhanced autofluorescence was imaged using 
369 
a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 8800) with excitation by a 488 nm laser. 
370 
Three-dimensional projections were created from confocal image stacks using Fluorender (Wan 
371 
et al., 2012). Three-dimensional reconstructions of glomeruli and antennal lobes were produced 
372 
by manually segmenting confocal image stacks using the Segmentation Editor plugin in the Fiji 
373 
distribution of ImageJ (Schindelin et al., 2012). Antennal lobe volumes were calculated using the 
374 
Object Counter3D ImageJ plugin (Bolte & Cordelieres, 2006), blindly with respect to genotype.  
375 
 
376 
Sharpie assay 
377 
 
Sharpie assays were conducted with tagged ants (Figure 3A-C) on printer paper in a 
378 
5.25x5.25 in arena bounded by a clear acrylic barrier. Six horizontal and 6 vertical black lines 
379 
were printed on the paper using an HP LaserJet printer (Figure 3A,B). Immediately before each 
380 
assay, 3 alternating horizontal and vertical black lines were traced with red Fine Point Sharpie 
381 
Permanent Marker (item 30002). Then the ant was placed in the center of the grid. A 2 min video 
382 
was recorded and the number of times the ant crossed black and Sharpie lines was manually 
383 
counted (Supplementary Video 2). A Sharpie repulsion index was calculated as the ratio of black 
384 
line crosses to total line crosses. Once the experiment had concluded, we determined that low 
385 
numbers of line crosses caused the repulsion indices to be unreliable, and we therefore excluded 
386 
four assays that had less than 10 line crosses total. As a positive control, a wild-type worker was 
387 
assayed after each assay with a low repulsion index to ensure the Sharpie lines retained a 
388 
repulsive effect. All positive controls had high repulsion indices and as a population were 
389 
statistically indistinguishable from the other wild-type workers assayed (P = 0.42, t-test).

G1 preparation for behavior and fitness experiments 
392 
 
G1 rearing resulted in a set of 34 colonies containing a mixture of G1 ants and Line A 
393 
progeny of chaperones. These colonies were used to identify mutants for egg-laying, automated 
394 
behavioral tracking, and survival experiments (Figure 3D-I, Figure 4, Supplementary Table 3). 
395 
Once each colony started producing eggs, we collected all eggs 5 times over a 14-16 day period. 
396 
CO1 amplicons from all eggs were genotyped to identify Line A and Line B eggs, and orco 
397 
amplicons from Line B eggs were Sanger sequenced to identify orco mutants. We sequenced 
398 
2,184 eggs from the 533 Line B ants in these colonies, corresponding to ca. 4 eggs per ant. 
399 
During the period of egg collection and one week after egg collection had concluded, we 
400 
subjectively determined whether any individuals in any given colony displayed a wandering 
401 
phenotype. Colonies in which orco mutant eggs were detected or in which wandering phenotypes 
402 
were observed were selected for the egg-laying dataset. 
403 
 
404 
Egg-laying dataset 
405 
 
We included 16 colonies in the egg-laying dataset. A subset of ants in these colonies were 
406 
later also used for behavioral and survival experiments (Supplementary Table 3, see below). 
407 
After the experiments had been concluded, all ants had a leg removed, from which orco 
408 
amplicons were sequenced. For each orcowt/– and orco–/– adult we identified, we counted the 
409 
number of eggs of its genotype in its colony. If several adults of the same genotype were 
410 
identified in a colony, for each individual we calculated the number of eggs of that genotype 
411 
divided by the number of adults of that genotype. We used a two-tailed Wilcoxon test to test 
412 
whether orcowt/– or orco–/– G1s produced different numbers of eggs than the average of wild-type 
413 
G1s in this experiment (Figure 4A). 
414 
 
415 
Behavioral and survival dataset 
416 
 
Before removing legs from ants for genotyping, workers from colonies that produced a 
417 
high frequency of orco mutant eggs or contained individuals with wandering phenotypes were 
418 
pooled to create 5 experimental colonies with a mixture of 12-14 G1 wild-type and orco mutant 
419 
ants. Before pooling, all workers in these colonies were individually tagged with two color dots. 
420 
These 5 colonies were recorded in 24 hr videos.  
421 
 
422 
 
Experimental O. biroi colonies initially contained a total of 68 G1 ants, with 42 wild-
423 
type, 8 orcowt/–, and 14 orco–/– individuals (Figure 1D). These colonies also contained 4 orco 
424 
mutant individuals with in-frame mutations, which were not included in the current analyses 
425 
because sample sizes were too small. G1s in experimental colonies varied in orco genotype but 
426 
were otherwise identical in rearing methods, genetic background, and did not differ 
427 
systematically in age. Before the start of each 24 hr video, colonies were cleaned and the plaster 
428 
was moistened. For four weeks after the video was recorded, we also recorded survival of all ants 
429 
in the 5 experimental colonies.  
430 
 
431 
Video recording and automated behavioral tracking 
432 
 
Automated behavioral tracking was performed in custom-made tracking setups under 
433 
constant illumination. Temperature was maintained at 25°C. Videos were acquired using C910 
434 
Logitech USB webcams controlled with custom MATLAB (version R2016a, The MathWorks, 
435 
Inc.) software at 10 fps at 960x720 pixel resolution (13 pixels/mm).

Tracking was performed blind with respect to genotype. Videos were processed and 
438 
analyzed using custom MATLAB software. In each frame, ants were segmented from the 
439 
background of the dish using a fixed threshold. Resulting components, or blobs, were linked into 
440 
trajectories using the optical flow computed between consecutive frames (Horn–Schunck method 
441 
(Barron et al., 1994)). Trajectories ended and new ones were initiated whenever blobs split or 
442 
merged between two consecutive frames. Trajectories stored the following data, collected from 
443 
the respective blob in each frame: centroid (position of center of mass), orientation (angle 
444 
between the major axis of the best-fitting ellipse and the horizontal axis) and area (in mm2). 
445 
 
446 
 
We used a threshold size to select trajectories that corresponded to a single ant and lasted 
447 
longer than two seconds. Each trajectory was then assigned a combination of color tags using a 
448 
custom classification algorithm. For each experiment, at least 500 frames per ant were manually 
449 
identified to create a training set, 70% of which was used to train, and 30% of which was used to 
450 
validate an automated identity classifier.  
451 
 
452 
 
For each trajectory, a naive Bayes color classifier (Fletcher et al., 2011) was used to 
453 
compute the pixel color probabilities for each pixel in the blob of each frame for six color 
454 
classes: the four tag colors, the ant cuticle color and the color of the plaster of Paris 
455 
(Supplementary Figure 2). Predicted probabilities for all four tag colors were used to determine 
456 
whether both tags were visible and, if so, the orientation of the ant in the frame was deduced 
457 
from the relative position of the tags with respect with the cuticle color. If both procedures were 
458 
successful, the pixel color probabilities were fed into another naive Bayes classifier to assign an 
459 
identity to the ant. 
460 
 
461 
 
For each trajectory, frames were tested in a random order until 20 frames were 
462 
successfully identified or no more frames were available. If at least one frame was identified, the 
463 
trajectory, and thus all its underlying positions, was assigned the most frequently predicted 
464 
identity. The identity classifier had an empirical error rate of 20% on single frames. However, 
465 
the error rate decreased with the number of frames tested within a trajectory. Overall, we 
466 
estimate that less than 10% of the total identified positions were misclassified, a performance 
467 
equivalent to that reported previously for a functionally similar tracking setup for ants (Mersch et 
468 
al., 2013). 
469 
 
470 
Behavioral analysis 
471 
Cleaning and watering the nests at the beginning of each experiment caused the ants to 
472 
actively move around the dish. We used this initial period of high activity to measure trail 
473 
following behavior, reasoning that trail pheromones may cause two or more ants to move along 
474 
the same path within the dish. For each ant, we measured the correlation between its own 
475 
movement and the movement of the remaining ants in the colony during the first hour of the 
476 
tracking experiment. As O. biroi have a tendency to walk along the edges of the dish, we 
477 
discarded segments of trajectories close to the edge of the dish and included only segments 
478 
where the ants moved faster than 1 mm/s continuously for at least 1 second and without contact 
479 
with any other ant. We then computed a 2-D histogram, or density map, for each ant by counting 
480 
the number of times one of the remaining positions in the 970x720 pixel original image fell into 
481 
each bin of a 120x90 bin grid. We then computed the Pearson correlation coefficient between the

 density map of each ant and a density map constructed from the trajectories of all ants in the 
483 
colony but the focal ant (Figure 3E). For each ant, the actual correlation coefficient provided an 
484 
estimate of the correlation of movement of that ant with the actual movement of other ants in the 
485 
colony, which presumably results from following pheromone trails.  
486 
 
487 
As a baseline comparison, the density map of each ant was correlated with a randomized 
488 
density map constructed by rotating the trajectories of all ants but the focal ant in the colony by a 
489 
random angle around the center of the dish (Figure 3E). This randomized correlation coefficient 
490 
provided an estimate of the correlation of the movement of that ant with the randomized 
491 
movement of other ants in the colony. This residual correlation reflects the portion of the 
492 
correlation that is due to non-local effects such as turning frequencies, linear and angular 
493 
velocity dynamics, and radial preference for certain regions of the petri dish. After examining the 
494 
data, two experimental colonies were excluded from the trail following analysis because they did

not form clear trails during the videos, resulting in Pearson correlation coefficients of 
496 
approximately zero for all ants in the colony. 
497 
 
498 
To measure wandering phenotypes, in each experiment we calculated the total distance 
499 
traveled by each ant over the 24 hr video by computing the distances between all pairs of 
500 
successive positions in meters in all identified trajectories. Time without contact was calculated 
501 
as the total time each ant was identified in each experiment (since ants were only identifiable 
502 
when they were separated from other ants). This provides a minimum estimate of the time 
503 
without contact for each ant, given that it was also possible for ants to be spatially separated from 
504 
other ants, yet unidentifiable, for example if their posture did not allow the detection of both 
505 
tags.  
506 
 
507 
Statistics 
508 
Behavioral tracking and antennal lobe volume measurements were performed blindly 
509 
with respect to genotype. Other analyses were not performed blindly with respect to genotype. 
510 
Mixed model statistics were performed in R v 3.3.1 using the lmer function in the lme4 library as 
511 
described previously (Ulrich & Schmid-Hempel, 2012; Ulrich & Schmid-Hempel, 2015). All 
512 
other statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism 7. Normality was determined by 
513 
D’Agostino-Pearson normality tests. Datasets used for ANOVA analyses had equal variance 
514 
across treatments. Single groups were compared against a predicted mean using two-tailed 
515 
Wilcoxon tests. Proportional data were compared between treatments using a Fisher exact test. 
516 
Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-tests or paired Wilcoxon tests were used to compare two groups, 
517 
when appropriate, and two-way ANOVAs followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test were 
518 
used to compare more than two groups.   
519

D. melanogaster glomerulus counts 
686 
 
Our reconstructions of D. melanogaster antennal lobe glomeruli yielded different 
687 
glomerulus numbers than what has been published previously (Supplementary Table 1). Our 
688 
reconstructions also showed small differences in glomerulus numbers between wild-type and 
689 
orco–/– flies (Figure 2). To address this possibility, we imaged and reconstructed two additional 
690 
D. melanogaster antennal lobes, one from an orco–/–  and one from a wild-type individual. 
691 
These reconstructions were not performed strictly de novo, as the O. biroi and D. 
692 
melanogaster reconstructions reported in the main text, but by referring to the published map of 
693 
the D. melanogaster antennal lobe (Laissue et al., 1999; Laissue & Vosshall, 2008). Due to 
694 
differences in sample preparation and imaging methods, it was not possible to unambiguously 
695 
match each glomerulus to the published map. However, we identified structures in our newly 
696 
reconstructed wild-type and orco–/– antennal lobes that corresponded to all published wild-type 
697 
glomeruli. These results suggest that orco–/– flies have no systematic reduction in the number of 
698 
antennal lobe glomeruli compared to wild-types, although it is possible that some neighboring 
699 
glomeruli in orco–/– flies have divisions that appear less distinct or may even be fused relative to 
700 
wild-types (Figure 2).  
701 
 
702 
Off-target effects 
703 
It has been shown that in some cases CRISPR/Cas9 injections can lead to off-target 
704 
mutagenesis that in turn can give rise to non-specific phenotypes. However, we consider this to 
705 
be highly unlikely in the current study due to the following reasons. First, we used a high-quality 
706 
reference genome to design the gRNA in this study to have no additional target sites in the 
707 
genome that are likely to lead to off-target cutting (Fu et al., 2013; Oxley et al., 2014) (see 
708 
Methods). Second, mutations induced by Cas9 are stochastically generated (Fu et al., 2013), such 
709 
that any off-target effects would likely be present in some G1 lines but not others. The 
710 
phenotypes we report are consistent across five independently generated orco–/– lines, and we do 
711 
not observe the same phenotypes across two independently generated orcowt/– lines 
712 
(Supplementary Table 3). Third, the striking reduction of orco–/– antennal lobes relative to 
713 
orcowt/– and wild-type antennal lobes is a phenotype specific to the ant chemosensory system that 
714 
is unlikely to arise from random off-target effects. This phenotype provides a direct functional 
715 
link between the orco–/– genotype and the chemosensory deficiencies described in this study. 
716 
Importantly, the antennal lobe phenotype was entirely discrete: every orco–/– brain had 
717 
substantially smaller antennal lobes than any orcowt/– or wild-type brain, even though this 
718 
phenotype was measured across multiple independently derived orco–/– and orcowt/– lines (Figure 
719 
2b, Supplementary Table 3). Therefore, while we cannot exclude the possibility that our 
720 
injections gave rise to some level of off-target mutations, it is unlikely that the specific 
721 
phenotypes reported in this study arise from off-target effects.  
722 
 
723 
Additional egg collection, injection, and rearing methods 
724 
 
We observed that the presence of eggs in O. biroi colonies inhibits the production of new 
725 
eggs and employed this observation for efficient egg collection. Egg-laying units were left with 
726 
eggs for 7 days to inhibit worker egg-laying. On day 0 eggs were removed to release inhibition, 
727 
and on day 2 eggs were removed again to further prevent inhibition. This led workers to 
728 
synchronously activate their ovaries, and on days 5, 6, and 7 eggs were collected for injection. 
729 
Following day 7, eggs were not collected from these colonies for 7 days, causing workers to

 become inhibited, and the protocol was then repeated. 
731 
 
732 
 
Eggs were collected from colonies under a stereoscope using insect pinning needles. On a 
733 
typical injection day, eggs were removed from colonies from 10-11 am, and those eggs were 
734 
used as uninjected incubation controls or fostered into rearing units. Eggs were collected for

injections from 2-3 pm and 6-7 pm and injected from 3-4 pm and 7-8 pm, respectively. 
736 
Therefore, all injected eggs were less than 5 hrs old, when O. biroi eggs are in a syncytial stage 
737 
of development with ˂100 nuclei (Oxley et al., 2014). Typical egg-laying units produced 2-5 
738 
eggs per day, and we collected from up to 60 egg-laying units, injecting 100-300 eggs per day.  
739 
 
740 
 
The anterior end of O. biroi eggs is slightly wider than the posterior end, and the ventral 
741 
surface is concave while the dorsal surface is convex. To inject, eggs were placed on double-
742 
sided 3M tape (Model S-10079 from Uline) on a glass slide, with the anterior end forward and 
743 
the ventral side upward. Eggs were injected into the anterior end, where nuclei are located in 
744 
early O. biroi embryos (Oxley et al., 2014). The ventral side was placed upward, so that larvae 
745 
hatched with the mouth facing away from the tape, which facilitated successfully recovering 
746 
larvae from the tape. To inject, eggs were individually submerged in 1-2 µL drops of water. Eggs 
747 
were gently pierced with the needle and injected for 1-2 seconds. During successful injections, 
748 
little or no cytoplasm is discharged from the egg when the needle is removed. Preliminary trials 
749 
showed that injection under liquid was necessary to remove the needle without rupturing the 
750 
chorion, and that water led to higher survival than Ringer, PBS, or halocarbon oil. A video was 
751 
recorded of every injection session, allowing us to verify that hatching larvae had been 
752 
successfully injected.  
753 
 
754 
 
Preliminary injections were conducted using multiple batches of reagents and variable 
755 
Cas9 and gRNA concentrations. These trials suggested that hatch rates varied inversely with 
756 
cutrates. Batch effects in hatch rates were observed across different days of injection within the 
757 
same experimental treatment, requiring multiple injection days and large numbers of eggs (~400) 
758 
to accurately estimate hatch rates of any given experimental treatment. In the final injection 
759 
round, eggs were injected with either low (1800 hPa) or high (6000 hPa) pressure (see Methods), 
760 
with sharper needles and lower injection volumes used in injections with high pressure. 46 of 
761 
2535 eggs (1.8%) hatched after injections with low pressure, and 58 of 756 eggs (7.6%) hatched 
762 
after injections with high pressure. 25 of the 42 G0s were Illumina sequenced, and we observed 
763 
an average of at least 27% cutrates at the predicted cut site resulted from low pressure injections 
764 
(n = 17) relative to 22% from high pressure injections (n = 8). orcowt/– and orco–/– G1s were 
765 
recovered from G0s injected with each method.   
766 
 
767 
 
Following injections, slides with eggs were incubated in air-tight plastic boxes (0.9L 
768 
SpaceCube boxes from ClickClack). Incubation boxes were prepared with a plaster of Paris floor 
769 
(85 g plaster of Paris mixed with 50 mL distilled water). The plaster was dried completely after 
770 
casting, and water was then added until the plaster became saturated with moisture to determine 
771 
the saturation volume. The plaster was then dried completely once again, after which 20% of the 
772 
saturation volume of distilled water was added. This procedure produced suitable incubation 
773 
conditions for 2 weeks, after which the plaster was discarded. Incubating eggs were checked 
774 
daily, and any water that had condensed on the eggs was removed with KimwipesTM tissue. 
775 
Fungus frequently grew on injection slides. Growth was controlled by spacing the eggs ~2 mm

 apart and mechanically breaking up fungal hyphae and overgrown eggs in 100% ethanol using 
777 
insect pinning needles. This egg-incubation protocol yielded ~60% hatch rates of uninjected 
778 
control eggs, which is similar to hatch rates of eggs in laboratory colonies. 
779 
 
780 
 
To synchronize hatching of larvae from injected eggs, eggs injected on days 5, 6, and 7 
781 
were incubated at different temperatures. Preliminary trials showed that eggs incubated at 25 °C 
782 
hatch after 9-10 days, while eggs incubated at 30 °C hatch after 7-8 days. We therefore incubated 
783 
eggs injected on days 5 and 7 at 25 °C and 30 °C, respectively, while eggs injected on day 6 
784 
were incubated at 25 °C for the first 5 days and then at 30 °C until hatching. This protocol 
785 
resulted in most larvae hatching on days 14 and 15. Once hatching had commenced, larvae were 
786 
manually removed from the egg membrane with an insect pinning needle, taking care to prevent 
787 
them from becoming stuck to the double-sided tape. Eggs that were expected to hatch overnight 
788 
were wrapped with a sheet of Parafilm® (stretched to be as thin as possible) to prevent larvae 
789 
from falling onto the tape. 
790 
 
791 
 
To rear G0 larvae, uninjected control eggs slightly older than the eggs injected on day 5 
792 
were placed with ~20 adult Line A workers in a Petri dish with a plaster of Paris floor and 
793 
maintained at 25 °C. These eggs hatched slightly earlier than the injected eggs, priming the 
794 
workers to rear larvae derived from injected eggs. When the larvae hatched from injected eggs, 
795 
control larvae were replaced with experimental (injected) larvae. Preliminary trials showed that 
796 
higher survival was obtained by fostering a minimum of 7 larvae at a time, so control larvae were 
797 
added to experimental larvae if insufficient experimental larvae were available. The G0 adults 
798 
reported in this study therefore include an unknown fraction of adults derived from control 
799 
larvae. Survival of larvae under these conditions was approximately 50%.

 Supplementary Table 3: Genotypes and raw data for all ants included in the present study. 
830 
Supplementary Table 3 is available in the Supplementary Materials. For an explanation of which 
831 
ants were used in which experiments, see Methods. #-XX (e.g., 3-GO) refers to G1 ants in the 
832 
datasets from the 5 experimental colonies. # gives the colony number, and XX gives the color 
833 
tags of the individual ants. These colonies were used for all automated behavioral tracking and 
834 
survival data (Figures 3D-H, and 4B). Some of these ants were also used for glomerulus counts, 
835 
antennal lobe volume, and egg-laying data (Figures 2A, 2B, 4A). E-# (e.g., E-1) refers to 
836 
additional G1 ants used for antennal lobe volume and egg-laying data (Figures 2B and 4A). A-# 
837 
(e.g., A-1) refers to wild-type ants used for glomerulus counts and antennal lobe volume (Figure 
838 
2A and 2B). S-# (e.g. S-1) refers to G2 ants used for Sharpie assays (Figure 3A-C).

Videos of exemplar wild-type and orco–/– ants in Sharpie assays (using the same individuals as in

Automated behavioral tracking of an experimental colony, showing trajectories and

identification of ants based on the following color tags: O: orange, P: pink, G: green and B: blue. 
852 
Note that individual identities are lost when ants form clusters. This two minute video of an 
853 
experimental colony shows the wandering behavior of orco–/– ants (PP and GG; the first letter 
854 
refers to the thorax tag, the second letter to the gaster tag). OP, which never leaves the nest 
855 
cluster and therefore is never identified, is orcowt/–; all other ants are wild-type. PP and GG are 
856 
seen antennating each other at 0:57 s. 
857 
 
858 
Supplementary Video 4: Additional social behaviors. 
859 
Ants are the same as in Supplementary Video 3. This video initially shows an orco–/– ant, PP, 
860 
grooming a pile of eggs. At 0:31 s PP begins to move, seemingly eliciting an alarm response that 
861 
causes the other ants in the colony to move toward PP. Note that GG, the second orco–/– ant in 
862 
the colony, does not become active. PP then moves toward the edge of the dish, possibly 
863 
depositing a chemical pheromone trail that is followed by some of her nestmates. Note that by 
864 
the end of the video a clear pheromone trail has formed that many of the wild-type ants are 
865 
following.
