ABSTRACT
Objectives: This study describes findings of the impacts of Hurricane Sandy on environmental factors
including power outages, air quality, water quality, and weather factors and how these affected mental
health during the hurricane.
Methods: An ecological study was conducted at the county level to describe changes in environmental
factors—especially power outages—and their relationships to emergency department (ED) visits for
mental health problems by use of a Poisson regression model.
Results: We found that many environmental hazards occurred as co-exposures during Hurricane Sandy
in addition to flooding. Mental health ED visits corresponded with the peak of maximum daily power
blackouts, with a 3-day lag, and were positively associated with power blackouts in Bronx (prevalence
ratio [PR]: 8.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27–61.42) and Queens (PR: 2.47, 95% CI: 1.05–5.82)
counties. A possible dose-response relationship was found between the quantile of maximum blackout
percentage and the risk of mental health in the Bronx.
Conclusion: We found that multiple co-environmental hazards occurred during Hurricane Sandy,
especially power blackouts that mediated this disaster’s impacts. The effects of power outage on mental
health had large geographic variations and were substantial, especially in communities with low
sociodemographic status. These findings may provide new insights for future disaster response and
preparedness efforts. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2016;10:314-319)

H
urricane Sandy was the largest storm ever
recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in
117 deaths and approximately $50 to $65
billion in damages.1 It struck the northeastern United
States the evening of Monday, October 29, 2012. The
Sandy-affected areas in New York state suffered
widespread resource loss, prolonged power outages
(blackouts), and disruption to transit systems, health
care services, and social systems. Although several
anecdotal reports or case studies reported environ-
mental impacts after Hurricane Sandy,2-4 few studies
have
systematically
described
the
environmental
impacts, especially multiple environmental factors
and their relationship to mental health. This article
describes preliminary findings of the impacts of
Hurricane Sandy on multiple environmental factors
(blackouts,
air
and
water
quality,
and
weather
factors), and how these factors affected mental health
in New York state.
METHODS
Study Population and Exposure Definition
The study population consisted of all persons regard-
less of age who resided in the 8 counties in southern
New York state, which included 5 New York City
(NYC) counties (Bronx, Queens, Kings, Richmond,
and New York) and 3 upstate counties (Nassau,
Suffolk, and Westchester). A modified definition of
the Hurricane Sandy period was defined as October
28, 2012, to November 9, 2012, by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to better
focus on Sandy’s impact in New York state.
Data Sources and Variable Definition
Emergency Department Visit Data
Information on daily emergency department (ED)
visits
was
obtained
from
the
New
York
State
Department of Health (NYSDOH) Statewide Plan-
ning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS).
SPARCS is a legislatively mandated database with
complete coverage for approximately 95% of New
York state hospitals (excluding federal and psychiatric
facilities). SPARCS data include patient information
on principal and other diagnoses, date of birth,
gender, race, ethnicity, street address, and admission
date. The data reported by hospitals are reviewed
by the SPARCS administrative staff for accuracy
and completeness. For this study, we identified and

 geocoded mental health ED visits (International Classifica-
tion of Diseases [ICD] codes: 290-299, 300-316, 980, E950-
959) during Hurricane Sandy from SPARCS. Access to these
data was granted by the NYSDOH Institutional Review
Board and the SPARCS Data Protection Review Board.
Power Outage Data
Blackout data were obtained from the Electric Outage
Reporting System recorded by the New York State Depart-
ment of Public Service. This system focuses on keeping
records during major blackout events. During Hurricane
Sandy, the number of blackouts was reported twice per hour.
Meteorological Data
Meteorological data including daily or hourly temperature, dew
points, barometric pressure, snowfall, snow depth, wind speed,
and wind direction were obtained from the National Center for
Atmospheric Research and the National Weather Service.
Air Pollution Data
Ambient air pollutant data including ozone (O3) and
particulate matter (PM2.5) were obtained from the New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYS-
DEC), which measures hourly O3 concentrations every day
(ppb) and 24-hour averaged PM2.5 levels. Because the ozone
season had passed by the time of the Hurricane Sandy period,
this study focused mainly on PM2.5.
Study Design and Statistical Analysis
This was an ecological study to evaluate environmental and
mental health data and their relationship in 8 Sandy-affected
counties. The daily maximum number of households with
blackouts and the daily maximum percentage of blackouts
(calculated by using daily maximum number of blackouts
divided by the total customers in each county) were used to
represent
the
impact
of
power
blackouts.
The
daily
prevalence of mental health–related ED visits was calculated
by using the daily number of mental health ED visits divided
by the population of each county based on the 2010 census.
Poisson regression was used to assess the association between
blackouts and mental health–related ED visits in the affected
area. Adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence
interval (CIs) were calculated for the overall study area and
individual counties controlling for day of the week effect. We
also evaluated a potential dose-response relationship by
categorizing the maximum percentage of blackout into
quartiles and then comparing the PRs for each quartile with
the lowest quartile (as the reference).
RESULTS
Power Outages and Mental Health
We examined the daily maximum number of blackouts in
each of the affected counties and found that Suffolk County
had the highest daily maximum number of blackouts
(470,000 households), followed by Nassau County (450,000)
and NYC (approximately 290,000). The peak for blackouts
in most counties occurred on October 30, 2012. In addition,
Nassau County had the highest percentage of households
without power (94.4%), followed by Suffolk (77.8%) and
Richmond (69.5%) counties. In terms of blackout duration,
Nassau had the longest recovery period (through November
12, 2012) and the highest impact (>50,000 residences
without power). Although Manhattan also experienced wide
blackouts (40.5%), it recovered within 5 days.
Our preliminary findings (Figure 1A) showed that the overall
daily mental health prevalence was 4.95 per 100,000.
The counties with the highest prevalence of mental health
diseases
during
the
Sandy period were Bronx
(7.15),
Kings (6.44), and New York (6.38), respectively. Among all
subtypes of mental health problems, substance abuse had the
highest overall prevalence (2.54/100,000). The counties of
New York, Bronx, and Kings had the highest substance abuse
rates (3.99, 3.52, and 3.30 per 100,000, respectively). For
other mental health problems, such as psychosis, mood
disorder, and suicide, Bronx County had the highest rates.
The 5 NYC counties experienced higher rates of total and
various mental health problems than the upstate New York
counties. In addition, mental health ED visits corresponded
with the peak of maximum daily percentage of blackouts,
with a case peak on November 3, three days after the
blackout peak, as described in Figure 1B.
Although a marginally overall protective effect was found
after the blackouts (Figure 1C), mental health ED visits were
positively associated with blackouts in Bronx (PR: 8.82, 95%
CI: 1.27–61.42) and Queens (PR: 2.47, 95% CI: 1.05–5.82)
counties. When the distribution of maximum blackout
was divided into quartiles (data not shown), we observed
a possible dose-response relationship (ie, the higher the
quantile of maximum percentage of blackout, the higher the
risk of mental health ED visits) in the Bronx.
Air Quality, Water Quality, and Weather Effects on
Mental Health
As described in Figure 2, fine particulate levels of PM2.5 in
the 8 affected counties during the Sandy period appeared to
be lower than almost all the levels in the previous years,
although the confidence intervals covered each other. We
also found that there were no significant changes in the levels
of physiochemical properties and microbacterial contamina-
tion in drinking water in the 8 affected counties during the
Sandy period compared to the water data in prior years. Fire
broke out in Queens County as a result of this superstorm on
October 29, 2012, followed by a peak of ED visits (113 cases)
due to mental health problems on the next day. We observed
increased numbers of mental health cases (but not statistically
significant) in the days with fire during the Hurricane Sandy

 period. On November 7, 2012, a winter storm hit New York
state, creating an early snowfall with lower air pressure, higher
wind speed, lower visibility, and higher precipitation than
usual. On the day after the snowstorm, most counties saw
a further increase in blackouts. The mental health cases seen
on the snow day were lower, with an increase in cases after
1 to 2 lag days following the snowfall.
DISCUSSION
Environmental Changes During Sandy
Loss of power after Hurricane Sandy probably posed the
greatest and most direct public health threat, with the largest
direct impact being on households in the 5 NYC counties
owing to their large population. Nassau County experienced
the largest impact from blackout, demonstrated by the highest
percentage outage
and longest power recovery period.
New York County had the fastest power recovery among the
affected counties, which may demonstrate the local govern-
ment’s rapid and effective responses. Interestingly, although
Queens and Kings counties are located next to Nassau
County, they suffered much less blackout, which may also
indicate the effectiveness of disaster response efforts by NYC
governments. The potential impacts from this superstorm
may have been reduced by joint and timely efforts from
multiple state and federal agencies, including providing more
than 170 medical shelters for providing care, establishing
68 Disaster Recovery Centers, and supplying more than
1 million liters of water and 1 million meals to those in need
within 24 hours.5
The current study found lower levels of PM2.5 measured by
routine monitors in all 8 affected counties during the Sandy
period, compared to prior years, which is consistent with
NYSDEC6 and US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
reports.7 This could have been due to higher precipitation,

 less traffic, and many power plants or industrial facilities
shutting down as a result of the blackouts. However,
additional monitors set up by NYSDEC6 in lower Manhattan
recorded PM2.5 levels exceeding the EPA’s 24-hour standard
for 2 days (November 15-16, 2012). This could have been
due to the emissions from widely used temporary generators
and building support equipment.6,8
Water contamination was a major health concern after
Hurricane
Sandy.
Our
data
did
not demonstrate
any
obvious evidence of drinking water contamination after
Sandy in the affected areas. However, this superstorm
knocked out power and damaged approximately 80 sewage
treatment
systems
in New
Jersey,
which
implies
that
approximately
2.75
billion
gallons
of
untreated
waste
flowed from the plant into the nearby bay.8 Fire posed
another hazard to the affected communities as a result of
Superstorm Sandy, which could have led to blackouts and
affected air quality and therefore may have had impacts on
human health.

 An early winter storm and snowfall on November 7, 2012,
put the affected residents in an even worse environment,
especially for those who lost power and had no heat.
The snow and storm may have limited local residents’ access
to health care facilities during the storm day and may have
therefore led to an increase in the number of ED visits
1 to 2 days after the storm, as access to medical care
facilities improved.
Environmental Factors and Mental Health
Our study found that power outage is one of the most
important environmental factors affecting mental health.
With every 1% increase in blackout, Bronx had almost an
8-fold increased risk of mental health ED visits demonstrating
a dose-response relationship, and Queens had a 1.5-fold
increased risk. We found that mental health ED visits
increased after 2 to 3 days of lag following a blackout. Fire
and a winter storm and snow were also found to be associated
with the increase in mental health problems. However, no
relevant literature could be found to compare with our find-
ings. We also found that substance abuse was highest among
all subtypes of mental health problems after disasters, which
was consistent with the findings in previous literature.9,10
Geographic Variations and Vulnerabilities
A
large
geographic
difference
in
mental
illness
after
Sandy was also found. In addition to the difference in scale
or degree of impacts by Sandy in different counties, the
regional difference may reflect vulnerability due to health
care access and demographics such as hospital density,
population
density,
and
sociodemographic
composition.
Although Nassau County was affected the most by blackouts,
we found that Bronx County had the highest rates of overall
and multiple subtypes of mental health ED visits, where
there are the highest proportions of Hispanic, African
American, and low-income households, as well as low
educational levels.
Joint Effects of Environmental Hazards
As described above, many environmental hazards occurred as
co-exposures during Hurricane Sandy, which integrated with
each other or interacted with flooding, resulting in potentially
negative impacts on health. For instance, flooding (plus the
snowstorm) first caused blackout, fire, and water contamina-
tion in some areas, and blackouts further worsened air quality
(due to the use of generators) and water quality (shutdown
of sewage treatment systems). Loss of power may also have
led to a joint effect with building environments. This
was particularly true for elderly residents living in NYC’s
high-rise
apartments,
many
of
whom
were
unable
to
descend stairways and became trapped for days or even
weeks as a result of nonfunctioning elevators during periods of
prolonged blackout.
CONCLUSION
We found that multiple co-environmental hazards occurred
during Hurricane Sandy, which may have intensified or
multiplied this disaster’s impacts. Among all environmental
hazards, the impact of power outages on mental health seems
substantial and had large geographic variations, especially in
communities
with
low
sociodemographic
status.
These
findings may provide new insight for future disaster response
and public health preparedness efforts.
