Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Despite the overlap in occurrence of cardio-
vascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes and their risk
factors, family history of these diseases has not yet been in-
vestigated simultaneously in relation to cardiometabolic
markers in offspring. We examined how a family history of
CVD and/or diabetes relates to cardiometabolic markers in
offspring, and to what extent these diseases independently
contribute to cardiometabolic markers.
Methods We used data from 1,374 12-year-old children and
their parents participating in a birth cohort study in the
Netherlands. Family history of CVD (myocardial infarction
[MI] and stroke) and diabetes were reported by the parents.
Children were classified as ‘no’, ‘moderate’ or ‘strong’ family
history, based on early/late onset of disease in parents and
grandparents. Cardiometabolic markers were measured at
12 years of age: waist circumference, cholesterol, blood pres-
sure and HbA1c.
Results Compared with those with no family history, children
with a strong family history of MI and/or stroke and/or diabe-
tes (29% of the study population) had 0.13 mmol/l higher total
cholesterol (TC) (95% CI 0.03, 0.23) and 0.18 higher TC/
HDL-cholesterol (HDLC) ratio (95% CI 0.04, 0.32). A strong
family history of MI or diabetes was independently associated
with unfavourable cardiometabolic markers specific to those
diseases. These associations remained after adjusting for BMI.
Children with a moderate family history had no unfavourable
cardiometabolic markers.
Conclusions/interpretation One-third of the children had a
strong family history of CVD and/or diabetes. These children
had higher TC levels and TC/HDLC ratios than children with
no family history. A strong family history of MI or diabetes
was independently associated with unfavourable cardiometa-
bolic markers specific to those diseases.

 e.g. socioeconomic position and health behaviours [1]. The
association of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in first- or
second-degree relatives with the presence of risk factors for
atherosclerosis, such as high cholesterol and BP, in children
has been described [2, 3]. Other studies showed that familial
aggregation of type 2 diabetes also relates to the presence of
cardiometabolic abnormalities in children [4–8]. CVD and
type 2 diabetes often co-occur [3, 9, 10] and share risk factors
such as hypertension, overweight, unhealthy diet and lack of
physical activity. However, previous studies assessing cardio-
metabolic markers in children lacked data on family history of
both CVD and diabetes, and it is unclear whether CVD and
diabetes history are independently associated with cardiomet-
abolic markers in children.
Lifestyle modification may reduce the risk of both CVD
and type 2 diabetes [11–14]. Individuals and families with a
history of these diseases may be more motivated to change
their lifestyle because they are more aware of their increased
risk for future disease [15]. Therefore, clarifying the cardio-
metabolic risk in children with a family history of CVD and/or
diabetes is important for families at increased risk for future
disease. Furthermore, when assessing associations of family
history with children’s cardiometabolic markers, few studies
have accounted for the number of affected relatives, or have
used a broader definition than early-onset disease to indicate a
positive family history. In the current study, we examined
differences in cardiometabolic markers among children with
no family history, a moderate or a strong family history of
CVD (myocardial infarction [MI] and stroke) and/or diabetes,
in a contemporary Dutch population.
Methods
We used data from a population-based Dutch birth cohort study,
the Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy
(PIAMA) study, with prenatal inclusion of 3,963 children in
1996/1997. A detailed description of the study design has been
published previously [16]. At age 11 years, 3,541 children
(89.4%) were still in the study. Of those children, 3,202 were
invited for a clinical assessment at age 12 years, and 1,511
participated (47.2%). Around age 14 years, parents completed
questionnaires including items on family history of MI, stroke
and diabetes. The study population for the current study
consisted of 1,374 children (704 girls, 670 boys) who had pa-
rental reports on family history and had had a clinical assess-
ment at age 12 years. Children diagnosed with diabetes mellitus
were excluded (n=5). The study protocol was approved by the
medical ethics committees of the participating institutes. All
parents gave written informed consent for participation in the
PIAMA birth cohort and separately for the clinical assessment;
additionally, children themselves gave written informed con-
sent for the clinical assessment.
Classification of family history Parents reported history of
MI, stroke and diabetes for the biological parents and grand-
parents of the child, and age at onset. Response categories for
each disease history were ‘yes’, ‘no’ and ‘unknown’. To de-
fine the severity of family history, we classified children into
three categories depending on the number of affected rela-
tives, age at onset and degree of kinship to the child. We did
this separately for MI, stroke, and diabetes. Children with no
affected parents and grandparents were classified as ‘no fam-
ily history’. Children with one or two grandparents with late
disease onset were classified as ‘moderate family history’.
Children with at least one affected parent or at least one grand-
parent with early disease onset or three or four grandparents
with late disease onset were classified as ‘strong family histo-
ry’. Further subdivision between parents and grandparents led
to small numbers in each category and therefore was not fea-
sible. Classification for family history of CVD and/or diabetes
followed classification for individual disease. Thus, children
classified as ‘strong family history’ for at least one of MI,
stroke or diabetes were classified as ‘strong family history of
CVD and/or diabetes’; the remaining children were classified
as ‘moderate’ (when they were classified as such for at least
one of MI, stroke or diabetes) or ‘no’ family history.
Early onset was defined as < 55 years in grandfathers and
< 65 years in grandmothers for MI and stroke, in agreement
with the 2011 integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health
and risk reduction in youth by the American National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Expert Panel [17]. For
diabetes, early onset was before 50 years in grandfathers and
grandmothers, a cut-off used in previous studies [18, 19].
The questionnaire inquired about history of diabetes, but not
type 2 diabetes explicitly. A small proportion (12/693, 1.7%) of
all relatives with diabetes developed the disease before age
20 years; these were likely to have type 1 diabetes. We classi-
fied these relatives as not having diabetes, allowing us to inter-
pret the results for children with a moderate or strong family
history of diabetes as history of type 2 diabetes.
Electronic supplementary material (ESM) 1 provides in-
sight into the prevalence of MI, stroke and diabetes for the
study population, by disease and by family member. The prev-
alence of MI, stroke and diabetes in PIAMA parents was
comparable with rates in the general (age-matched) Dutch
population (see ESM 2). We could not compare disease prev-
alence in grandparents with that in the Dutch population be-
cause the ages of the grandparents were unknown.
Overall, 15% (n=208) of children had one or more un-
known or missing items of family history. Missing values
mostly concerned presence of disease (n =154) and some-
times the age at disease onset (n=39) or both (n=15). The
proportion of values reported as unknown or missing, relative
to the total number of family members (six per child), was
small for each disease: 2.5% for MI; 2.3% for stroke; and
2.6% for diabetes. We classified relatives with missing age

 at onset for CVD or diabetes as late onset, to avoid
misclassifying those with late onset as being in the highest
risk category. If a specific disease in a specific relative was
missing or ‘unknown’, we categorised this relative as not hav-
ing that disease, as this was most likely considering the young
age of the children and their parents. Otherwise, excluding the
entire family history for this child would lead to loss of infor-
mation. In addition, it reflects the real-world situation: people
may not always be aware of diseases running in their
(extended) families. We addressed this in a sensitivity analysis
(see Statistical methods and ESM 3).
Assessment of anthropometry and cardiometabolic
markers Clinical assessments at age 12 years were performed
by trained staff during home visits according to standardised
protocols. Height, weight and waist circumference were mea-
sured while children were wearing underwear. BMI (kg/m2)
was used in the analyses as age- and sex-specific SD scores
(z scores) using the reference growth curves of the fourth
Dutch nationwide growth study carried out in 1997 [20].
Overweight (including obesity) was defined based using in-
ternational defined cut-off points [21]. Waist circumference
was measured twice and the mean of the two measurements
was used in analyses.
Systolic and diastolic BP were measured according to the
recommendations of the American Heart Association Council
on High Blood Pressure Research [22]. BP readings were
obtained from the non-dominant upper arm using an Omron
M6 monitor while the child was seated. The first measurement
was taken after ≥ 5 min of rest, without talking. Depending on
arm circumference, a 17–22 cm or 22–32 cm cuff was used.
BP was measured at least twice with 5 min intervals. If two
consecutive measures differed by > 5 mmHg, another mea-
surement was taken. The means of (two or three) systolic and
diastolic measurements were used in analyses.
Blood was drawn for measurement of cholesterol and
HbA1c. Serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and HDL-
cholesterol (HDLC) were determined enzymatically using
Roche automated clinical chemistry analysers (Roche
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The ratio of TC and
HDLC was calculated (TC/HDLC ratio). For analysis of
HbA1c, erythrocytes from blood samples were stored, a 5 μl
cell mass was lysed and HbA1c was measured by ion-
exchange chromatography using the Adams A1c HA-8160
HPLC auto analyser (Menarini Diagnostics Benelux,
Valkenswaard, the Netherlands). This analyser was
standardised on DCCT standards.
Other characteristics Characteristics used to describe the
study population were: the child’s sex, ethnicity, age,
pubertal development; and parental age, education and
BMI. Ethnicity was based on the country of birth of the
child’s parents, and was categorised as Dutch, non-Dutch
western and non-western. Pubertal development (puberty
development scale, 1–4) [23] was reported by the child at
age 11 years and used as a continuous variable in the
analysis. The mother’s and father’s educational levels
were categorised as low (primary school, lower vocational
or lower secondary education), intermediate (intermediate
vocational education or intermediate/higher secondary
education) or high (higher vocational education and
university). The mother’s and father’s BMI were calculated
from reported weight and height when the child was 14 years
old and were categorised as overweight (BMI≥25 kg/m2) or
normal weight (BMI<25 kg/m2).
Statistical methods Differences in cardiometabolic markers
in children with moderate or strong family history were
assessed by multiple linear regression analyses, treating no
family history as reference. Across the categories, p values
for trend were estimated by treating the categorical variables
as continuous variables in the model. We adjusted for child’s
sex, age at clinical assessment, ethnicity, height, pubertal
development, maternal and paternal education and maternal
and paternal age in the first adjusted model. These
confounders were selected based on prior knowledge and their
associations with the outcome of interest. Parents and grand-
parents who were older at the time of family history assess-
ment were more likely to have developed the disease. We
adjusted for this by including maternal and paternal age in
the regression models, considering these as a proxy for grand-
parental age. Analyses with BP were additionally adjusted for
cuff size. In the second model, we added maternal and paternal
BMI to investigate whether associations could be explained
by BMI levels shared within families. In the third model, we
further added the child’s BMI (measured at age 12 years). We
investigated whether family history of MI, stroke or diabetes
was independently associated with cardiometabolic markers
by mutually adjusting for the other two diseases. Differences
by sex have been observed in the association between family
history and offspring cardiometabolic markers [24]. We
investigated this by including interaction terms of sex with
family history categories in the regression models. We
conducted two sensitivity analyses to determine the
robustness of the associations (see ESM 3 and 4). We
used SAS version 9.3 for all analyses (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA).
Results
History of parental MI was present for 1.3% of the children,
0.8% had a history of parental stroke and 3.5% had a history of
parental diabetes. More children had grandfathers with MI or
stroke than grandmothers (43% vs 11% for MI and 19% vs
14% for stroke, respectively), whereas history of diabetes was
1668

 similar in grandfathers and grandmothers (24% vs 23%)
(ESM 1).
Based on family history of individual diseases, 17% of the
children had a strong family history of MI, 8% of stroke and
10% of diabetes (Table 1). Considering a combination of fam-
ily history of MI, and/or stroke and/or diabetes, 29% of the
children (n=401) had a strong family history. Of these chil-
dren, 84% had a strong family history of one disease only:
43% (n=173) of MI only; 17% (n=69) of stroke only; and
24% (n=96) of diabetes only (data not shown). Children with
a strong family history of CVD and/or diabetes were more
often overweight, of non-western ethnicity and had parents
with a lower education and with a higher BMI compared with
children with no family history (Table 2). There were no large
differences in age, sex or pubertal development.
Overall, children with a moderate family history of CVD
and/or diabetes had no unfavourable cardiometabolic markers
whereas children with a strong family history did when com-
pared with children with no family history (Table 3). The
p values for trend from moderate to strong family history were
significant only for the associations hereafter (Table 3). Children
with a strong family history of MI had 0.12 mmol/l higher TC
(95% CI 0.01, 0.23), 0.05 mmol/l lower HDLC (95% CI −0.10,
−0.003) and 0.24 higher TC/HDLC ratio (95% CI 0.09, 0.39)
compared with those with no family history, after adjustment for
confounders (Table 4). Children with a strong family history of
diabetes had a 2.25 cm larger waist circumference (95% CI
1.08, 3.41), 0.20 mmol/l higher TC (95% CI 0.07, 0.34), 0.22
higher TC/HDLC ratio (95% CI 0.03, 0.40) and 0.57 mmol/mol
higher HbA1c (95% CI 0.06, 1.09). A strong family history of
stroke was not associated with cardiometabolic markers.
Children with a strong family history of CVD and/or diabetes
compared with those with no family history had 0.13 mmol/l
higher TC (95% CI 0.03, 0.23) and 0.18 higher TC/HDLC ratio
(95% CI 0.04, 0.32). For most of the cardiometabolic markers,
adjustment for BMI of the parents and subsequent adjustment
for BMI of the child hardly changed the effect estimates in
children with a strong family history (Table 4). Effect estimates
and interpretation of the results did not change after adjusting for
waist circumference of the child instead of BMI (data not
shown). The associations remained when mutually adjusting
for family history of the other diseases (Table 5); strong family
histories of MI and diabetes were independently associated with
0.11 and 0.18 mmol/l higher TC, respectively.
Associations of family history of CVD/diabetes with car-
diometabolic markers were similar in boys and girls (p values
for interaction > 0.15). We therefore show results for boys and
girls combined. Sensitivity analyses indicated that associa-
tions were robust and not affected by missing data or by
reporting of disease history for the family in-law (ESM 3
and 4).
Discussion
One-third of the 12-year-olds in our study had a strong family
history of CVD and/or diabetes, and these children had higher
TC levels and TC/HDLC ratios than children with no family
history. Compared with family history of CVD and/or diabe-
tes, a strong family history of a single disease was present in
fewer children, but showed stronger associations with disease-
specific cardiometabolic markers. Family history of MI may
be most relevant for children’s cholesterol levels (HDL, TC
and TC/HDLC ratio), whereas family history of diabetes may
be relevant for children’s waist circumference and HbA1c, in
addition to cholesterol levels. Importantly, the associations for
individual diseases were independent of family history of the
other diseases. Children with a moderate family history had no
unfavourable cardiometabolic markers.
As far as we are aware, only three studies have previously
investigated family history of both CVD and diabetes and
cardiometabolic outcomes in children from the general popu-
lation [24–26]. One study investigated cardiometabolic
markers in the child as predictors of parents’ subsequent
CVD and diabetes; therefore, our results are not directly com-
parable [25]. The other two studies were conducted two de-
cades ago within the Bogalusa Heart Study. They lacked the
disease history of grandparents and age of the parents, and there-
fore were not able to categorise individuals into groups with no,

 moderate or strong family history. Bao et al observed that, in
adolescents aged 11–17 years, parental MI was related to higher
systolic BP and insulin, parental stroke was not related to car-
diometabolic markers and parental diabetes was related to higher
systolic BP and glucose levels [24]. Shear et al further specified
that among children aged 5–7 years, those with one parent with
diabetes plus another parent with CVD or diabetes had the
highest lipid levels [26]. Our study is the first to investigate both
diabetes and cardiovascular disease history in two generations.
Our findings add to the previous findings that in 12-year-old
children from a contemporary cohort, history of MI and diabetes
in parents and grandparents may be a relevant and important risk

 factor for unfavourable waist circumference, levels of cholester-
ol and HbA1c, and potentially for future cardiometabolic disease,
largely independent of parental and child BMI.
In our study, stroke was not strongly associated with car-
diometabolic markers. This is consistent with results from
other studies in children [24, 26] and adults [27]. Although a
family history of stroke has been associated with clinical CHD
outcomes, such as heart attack, in adult studies, history of
stroke is generally not associated with outcomes of subclinical
atherosclerosis, such as the intermediate risk factors investi-
gated in the current study. Bao et al noted that the predictive
nature of stroke may also be limited by differences in the
aetiological origin of different types of stroke, i.e. ischaemic
or haemorrhagic [24]. Family history of CVD or diabetes was
not associated with the child’s BP in our study. The Bogalusa
Heart Study showed that associations with BP may emerge at
older ages than our population of 12-year-olds, particularly in
children whose parents have hypertension [24].
A key strength of this study is the availability of
extensive family history information for three different
diseases, which allowed us to estimate the combined
disease burden that runs within families and to show
disease-specific associations. We obtained disease histo-
ry and age at onset for parents as well as grandparents,
which enabled us to define the family history burden in
children more precisely. We adjusted for parental BMI
and child BMI and showed that most associations were
independent of these factors.
The limitations of this study include reliance on retrospec-
tive parent-reported family history. Although we could not
validate reported history of diabetes and CVD with medical
records, evidence suggests that family history of diabetes and
major CVD events are reported fairly accurately, because
they are serious, but not stigmatised, diseases with clear case
definitions [3, 28]. Family history of diabetes may have been
underreported because of under diagnosis [3], which may
have led to underestimation of the true association. Mothers
of the PIAMA children completed most questionnaires
(85%), which is likely to explain the higher number of un-
knowns and missing reports of disease cases in the fathers’
lineage. However, the total percentage of missing responses
and unknowns in reports of family history was small (2–3%),
and a systematic review and meta-analysis recently conclud-
ed that transmission of CVD risk is not different between
fathers’ and mothers’ lineages [29]. This seems also true
for diabetes [30]. In addition, when we restricted the main
analysis to children who lived with both parents together,
effect sizes hardly changed, indicating that potential
misreporting by single parents did not affect the results. For
these reasons, we do not expect that the higher proportion of
missing family history reports in fathers’ lineages will have
biased the associations.
In the current study, a strong family history of CVD and/or
diabetes was defined as at least one affected parent, at least
one grandparent with early disease onset or three or four
grandparents with late disease onset, but no gold standard
exists for the definition of family history of disease [31, 32].
Compared with the most commonly used dichotomous score,
our classification has important benefits as it accounts for
number of relatives, age at onset and degree of kinship. A
further advantage is our approach of investigating parents
and grandparents, as this implies that the maximum family
history ‘score’ was equal for all families (in contrast to other
scores that may be higher or lower relative to the family size).
Our study lacked power to assess combinations of two or
three diseases, e.g. a strong family history of either diabetes or
CVD, and of both diabetes and CVD. The majority of the
children had a strong family history of only one disease, thus
the prevalence of a strong family history of diabetes and MI
was only 2%. It may be relevant for future studies to investi-
gate a combined family history of CVD and diabetes, rather
than single family history, in relation to the offspring’s

 cardiometabolic markers. Such analyses would clarify wheth-
er the burden of two diseases combined is higher than the
burden of single disease in the family.
The percentage of children with a strong family history in
our study and the strengths of the associations we observed
should not be interpreted in absolute terms. The incidence of
type 2 diabetes and particularly of CVD increases with age,
therefore future events in parents and grandparents are likely
to reclassify children towards higher risk categories. This may
affect the magnitude of the observed differences, which may
be more pronounced with an increasing proportion of children
with a strong family history. The associations, in particular
with waist circumference and TC/HDLC ratio, were strong
and the differences (2.25 cm waist circumference and 0.22
TC/HDLC ratio for children with strong vs no family history
of diabetes) may be considered clinically relevant [33, 34].
Cardiometabolic markers track over time from childhood to
adulthood [35, 36]. When measured in adolescence or early
adulthood, cardiometabolic markers relate to adult carotid in-
tima media thickness and cardiovascular disease [36, 37].
Therefore, children with subclinical elevated cardiometabolic
markers are likely to be at risk for developing cardiovascular
disease in adulthood.
Children with a strong family history of CVD and/or
diabetes were more often overweight, had parents who were
born in a non-western country, with a lower level of education
and a higher BMI. Typically, these are priority groups for the
prevention of overweight and cardiovascular disease, but also
the groups that are not easily reached by preventive efforts. An
awareness of a potentially increased risk for their children of
diseases later in life that is associated with their own family
disease history may increase families’ motivation to follow
healthy lifestyle guidelines [38]. Children of immigrants were
under-represented in the PIAMA study, and we cannot
exclude the possibility that different associations of family
history of diabetes/CVD with offspring cardiometabolic
markers would be observed for other ethnicities. Most
associations persisted after adjusting for parental BMI,
indicating that parental BMI as a proxy for shared lifestyle
within families could not completely explain the associa-
tions between family history and child’s cardiometabolic
markers. Moreover, associations remained significant after
additionally adjusting for child’s BMI, indicating that
even children with a healthy weight could be at risk for
unfavourable levels of cardiometabolic markers if their
parents or grandparents had MI or diabetes. Lifestyle
factors may be on the pathway from family history to
cardiometabolic markers in offspring, which is an impor-
tant topic for further investigation. Future studies may
particularly focus on lifestyle behaviours that are passed
on from one generation to the next as these may account
for (part of) the association of diabetes/CVD in multiple
generations with cardiometabolic risk in the offspring.
Conclusions
A large proportion of children in our study had a strong family
history of CVD and/or diabetes, with cholesterol levels that
were significantly higher than the levels in children with no
family history of disease. Children with a strong family histo-
ry of MI or diabetes had unfavourable cardiometabolic
markers that were specific to those diseases.
