Child Maltreatment and Adult 
Living Standards at 50 Years
Snehal M. Pinto Pereira, PhD, Leah Li, PhD, Chris Power, PhD
abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Child maltreatment (abuse and neglect) has established effects on 
mental health. Less is known about its influence on adult economic circumstances. We 
aimed to establish associations of child maltreatment with such outcomes and explore 
potential pathways.
METHODS: We used 1958 British birth cohort data (N = 8076) to examine associations of child 
neglect and abuse with adult (50 years) long-term sickness absence, not in employment, 
education or training (NEET), lacking assets, income-related support, poor qualifications, 
financial insecurity, manual social class, and social mobility. We assessed mediation of 
associations by 16-year cognition and mental health.
RESULTS: Abuse prevalence varied from 1% (sexual) to 10% (psychological); 16% were 
neglected. A total of 21% experienced 1 maltreatment type, 10% experienced ≥2 types. 
Sexual and nonsexual abuse were associated with several outcomes; eg, for sexual abuse, 
adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of income-related support was 1.75 (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 1.12–2.72). Associations were little affected by potential mediating factors. Neglect 
was associated with several adult outcomes (eg, aOR of NEET was 1.43 [95% CI, 1.10–1.85]) 
and associations were mediated by cognition and mental health (primarily by cognition): 
percent explained varied between 4% (NEET) to 70% (poor qualifications). In general, the 
risk of poor outcome increased by number of maltreatment types (eg, aOR for long-term 
sickness absence increased from 1.0 [reference] to 1.76 [95% CI, 1.32–2.35] to 2.69 [95% CI, 
1.96–3.68], respectively, for 0, 1, and ≥2 types of maltreatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Childhood maltreatment is associated with poor midadulthood socioeconomic 
outcomes, with accumulating risk for those experiencing multiple types of maltreatment. 
Cognitive ability and mental health are implicated in the pathway to outcome for neglect 
but not abuse.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Child 
maltreatment (abuse and neglect) has established 
effects on long-term mental health. The extent to 
which broader adult life circumstances (eg, economic 
productivity) are affected and underlying child-
to-adult pathways are less well understood due to 
scarcity of long-term follow-up.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Child maltreatment was 
associated with poor adult socioeconomic outcomes, 
with evidence of accumulating burden for those 
experiencing multiple maltreatments. Associations 
for neglect operated via cognition; associations for 
sexual and nonsexual abuse were little affected by 
adolescent cognition and mental health.

Child maltreatment, encompassing 
abuse and neglect, is a major 
social welfare problem. Several 
consequences have been identified, 
including poor mental health, 
obesity, and poor cardiovascular 
profiles, with effects perpetuating 
into adulthood. 
1 
 
– 
4 Although early-
life socioeconomic disadvantage is 
known to affect adult circumstances 
in terms of economic productivity, 
including employment, and social 
mobility, 
5 less is known about the 
influence of maltreatment on such 
outcomes. 
3 Identifying influences on 
these outcomes is important, given 
their economic implications: for 
example, costs of long-term absences 
from work are substantial and shared 
between individuals, employers, and 
the government. Individuals suffer 
financial and social losses, becoming 
increasingly distanced from the labor 
market; UK employers pay £9 billion 
per year in sick-pay associated costs, 
and the government spends £13 
billion per year on health-related 
benefits. 
6 Therefore, reducing 
unfavorable outcomes is high on the 
policy agenda. 
6, 
 
7
The limited evidence available 
on associations between 
child maltreatment and adult 
socioeconomic outcomes comes from 
cross-sectional studies 
8, 
 
9 or includes 
maltreatment cases that have been 
reported to authorities, which may 
be atypical of maltreatment in the 
general population. 
10 Moreover, 
because child maltreatment is 
associated with poorer educational 
achievement and cognition, 
 
3, 
11 we 
might expect less favorable social 
mobility patterns from class of origin, 
as well as less advancement over the 
individuals' working life. The deficits 
in cognitive abilities and behavioral 
adjustment observed in maltreated 
children 
11 could represent important 
pathways to reduced economic 
circumstances in adulthood, given 
that such deficits have detrimental 
economic consequences. 
12 
– 
14 It is 
important to improve understanding 
of the full consequences of 
child maltreatment and likely 
explanations, partly because 
detrimental socioeconomic outcomes 
have implications for health15 
 
– 
18 yet, 
to our knowledge, such associations 
have not been demonstrated.
Using a general population birth 
cohort, we aimed to establish the 
extent to which child maltreatment is 
associated with adult circumstances 
with respect to labor market 
participation, living standards, 
and social mobility, taking into 
account other early-life factors, 
such as parental education. We 
also examined potential mediating 
pathways via adolescent cognition 
and mental health. Specific outcomes 
included: long-term sickness absence; 
not in employment, education, or 
training; lacking assets; income-
related support; poor educational 
qualifications; financial insecurity; 
manual social class and inter- and 
intragenerational social mobility 
to midadulthood. We examined 
neglect and (different types of) abuse 
separately to assess whether there 
were differential effects on outcomes 
and also examined associations for 
multiple types of maltreatment to 
assess the cumulative burden.
METHODS
The 1958 British birth cohort is a 
longitudinal study of all individuals 
born in 1 week in March 1958, across 
England, Scotland, and Wales (n = 
17 638) and 920 immigrants with 
the same birth week. 
19 Information 
was collected throughout childhood 
(at birth and at 7, 11, and 16 years) 
and adulthood (23, 33, 42, 45, and 
50 years) from individuals, as well as 
parents, teachers and school doctors 
(childhood surveys) and nurses (at 
45 years). Of the 11 971 invited, 9377 
participated in the 45-year survey, 
with 9315 completing childhood 
maltreatment questions; of these, 
8150 participated at 50 years 
(Supplemental Fig 1). Respondents 
in midadulthood were broadly 
representative of the surviving 
cohort. 
20 Ethical approval was given 
for various surveys, including at 50 
years, by the London Multicentre 
Research Ethics Committee; 
informed consent was obtained from 
participants at various ages.
Childhood Maltreatment
Neglect (prospective) was identified 
from information collected in 
childhood from parental interviews 
(usually the mother) and the 
child’s teacher by using structured 
questionnaires ( 
Table 1). Experience 
of emotional neglect and abuse 
(sexual, physical, psychological, or 
witnessing) during childhood (to 16 
years) was reported at 45 years by 
using a confidential direct computer 
data entry questionnaire ( 
Table 1).
Adult Outcomes
Details of adult outcomes are given 
in  
Table 2. In brief, we identified 
3 labor market groups from 
participant reports of their current 
economic activity: the (1) long-
term sickness absence (LTS), (2) 
not in employment, education, or 
training (NEET), and (3) employed 
(full- or part-time as an employee 
or self-employed) or in education 
or training. Home ownership and 
receipt of income-related support 
were used as markers of assets/
wealth. Education level was 
measured prospectively to 50 
years. At 45 years, information on 
financial insecurity was ascertained. 
For social class and mobility, we 
used information on occupation 
collected at birth, 23 years, and 
50 years to group nonmanual and 
manual classes. Social mobility 
was examined from (1) parent’s 
class to own class at 50 years 
(intergenerational) and (2) own class 
at 23 to 50 years (intragenerational). 
For intergenerational mobility, 
we created 2 binary variables: (1) 
upward mobility from manual class 
at birth (versus stable manual);

and (2) downward mobility from 
nonmanual class at birth (versus 
stable nonmanual). Similar variables 
were created for intragenerational 
mobility (23–50 years).
Covariates were identified as 
early-life factors that influence 
socioeconomic destinations 
and included those related to 
socioeconomic background (ie, social 
class in 1958, parental education, 
household amenities, crowding, and 
tenure), birth (maternal age, birth 
weight, and birth order) and poor 
child health. Potential mediating 
factors included cognitive ability 
and mental health assessed at 
16 years (indicated by reading/math 
tests and internalizing/externalizing 
behaviors, respectively, as in 
previous work 
11).
Analysis
We used logistic regression to 
assess associations of each type of 
maltreatment with adult outcomes 
(labor market participation, 
living standards, and social class) 
separately. We tested the interaction 
between each type of maltreatment 
and sex; there was little evidence of 
effect modification, hence results are 
presented for sexes combined. We 
examined univariable associations 
before adjusting for covariates (listed 
above). Next, because different types 
of maltreatment cooccur, 
 
27 
we assessed (1) associations 
for all types of maltreatment 
simultaneously and (2) 2-way 
correlations between maltreatment 
types. Mutual adjustment for 6 
types of maltreatment may be 
overadjustment. Thus, we derived 
a score to represent the number 
of moderately correlated types 
of maltreatment (ie, pairwise 
correlation coefficients ≥0.4) and 
examined the score and other types 
of maltreatment simultaneously 
with outcomes. To assess possible

mediation of associations by 
cognition and mental health, we 
used 2 methods in which these 
factors were modeled separately 
and combined: (1) in a series 
of adjusted models; and (2) in 
mediation analyses using inverse 
odds ratio (OR) weighting, 
 
28 from 
which we obtained the “total effects” 
of maltreatment on outcomes and 
the “direct effects” that were not 
via potential mediator(s) (the 
percent of “total effect” explained 
was calculated). To investigate 
the cumulative burden of multiple 
types of maltreatment, we examined 
associations between the number of 
types (0, 1, and ≥2) and outcomes 
using a trend test.
In sensitivity analyses, we checked 
first whether child maltreatment 
associations with adult (50 years) 
outcomes were replicated with 
similar outcomes, where available, 
at 23 years (ie, LTS, NEET, and 
social class). Second, we examined 
associations for NEET as 2 
categories: unemployed seeking 
work and looking after home/family. 
Associations with outcomes were 
broadly similar for the 2 categories 
(data not shown), possibly because 
individuals may identify as home/
family rather than unemployed, thus, 
associations for combined NEET 
groups are presented.
To investigate whether those 
maltreated in childhood were as 
likely as the nonmaltreated to be 
socially mobile, we estimated ORs 
for upward and downward mobility 
from class at birth (intergenerational 
mobility). Specifically, we examined 
upward mobility among those who 
were from a manual background and 
downward mobility among those 
who were from a nonmanual class. 
Similar analyses were undertaken for 
intragenerational mobility.
Of the 8150 participants who 
completed the child maltreatment 
questions at 45 years and 
participated at 50 years, the number 
available for analysis was 8076 
due to exclusions (n = 98) with 
intellectual impairment assessed 
at 7 years and missing data (n = 5) 
(Supplemental Fig 1). Social class and 
mobility analyses were restricted 
to those employed at 50 years 
(n = 7002). Missing data ranged 
from 0.01% (education level) to 16% 
(23-year social class). To minimize

data loss, missing data were imputed 
by using multiple imputation chained 
equations. Following guidelines (to 
justify the plausibility of the missing-
at-random assumption), imputation 
models included all model variables 
(including 23-year outcomes), plus 
main predictors of missingness 
(7-year behavior and cognitive 
ability). 
20 Regression analyses were 
run across 20 imputed data sets and 
overall estimates were obtained. 
Imputed results were broadly similar 
to those obtained by using observed 
values; the former are presented.
RESULTS
Prevalence of child maltreatment 
varied from 1% for sexual abuse 
to 6% for physical and witnessing 
abuse and 10% for psychological 
abuse; 11% experienced emotional 
neglect and 16% were identified as 
neglected (prospective) ( 
Table 3). 
In midadulthood, outcomes, such as 
LTS, NEET, and financial insecurity, 
affected <1 in 10 of the population, 
whereas outcomes, such as income-
related support, were more 
prevalent. Upward mobility from 
class of origin was common (44%), 
partly occurring as intragenerational 
mobility (23 to 50 years).
All types of child maltreatment, 
when examined separately, were 
associated with increased risk of 
adult LTS, NEET, lack of assets, and 
financial insecurity (Supplemental 
Table 6, Model 1). Associations 
attenuated after adjustment for 
covariates (Supplemental Table 6, 
Model 2); for example, the OR of LTS 
ranged from 2.50 (95% confidence 
interval (CI), 1.94–3.22) to 1.77 
(95% CI, 1.34–2.33) for neglect 
(prospective). For LTS, NEET, and 
social class at 23 years, patterns of 
association were similar to those 
observed for the 50-year outcomes 
(Supplemental Table 7). A total of 
21% of the population experienced 
1 type of maltreatment and 10% 
experienced ≥2 types (Supplemental 
Table 8). Except for qualifications 
and social class, the risk of 
unfavorable outcomes increased with 
the number of types of maltreatment 
(eg, adjusted OR for LTS increased 
from 1.0 to 1.76 [95% CI, 1.32–2.35] 
to 2.69 [95% CI, 1.96–3.68] [Ptrend 
< 0.01] for 0, 1, and ≥2 types, 
respectively).
When all maltreatment types 
were considered simultaneously 
(Supplemental Table 6, Model 3), 
associations with 50-year outcomes 
were reduced, particularly for 
emotional neglect and physical, 
psychological, and witnessing 
abuse. These 3 types of abuse were 
moderately correlated (r ≥ 0.4), 
whereas other types of maltreatment 
were less correlated (r < 0.3); hence, 
we created a nonsexual abuse score 
(0, 1, and 2–3 types). In simultaneous 
analysis of neglect (prospective), 
emotional neglect, sexual abuse, 
and nonsexual abuse, both abuse 
measures were associated with 
lacking assets, income-related 
support, and financial insecurity 
(Table 4). Sexual abuse was also 
associated with poor qualifications 
and manual class, whereas nonsexual 
abuse was associated with LTS: the 
OR increased from 1.0 (reference) 
to 1.75(95% CI, 1.22–2.51) to 
2.10 (1.40–3.17) (Ptrend < 0.01), 
respectively, for 0, 1, and 2 to 3 
types. For both abuse measures, 
associations with outcomes were 
generally little affected by cognition 
and mental health at 16 years (Table 
4, Supplemental Table 9). Emotional 
neglect was associated with only 
1 outcome (financial insecurity) 
and again, 16-year cognitive ability 
and mental health did not explain 
the association. Lastly, neglect 
(prospective) was associated with 
several outcomes (LTS, NEET, lacking 
assets, poor qualifications, and 
manual class); eg, the LTS OR was 
1.69 (95% CI, 1.28–2.23) and the 
NEET OR was 1.43 (95% CI, 1.10–
1.85). Associations were attenuated 
or abolished when cognition and 
mental health were included in the 
models (Table 4) or considered as 
mediators (Supplemental Table 9). 
Hence, associations were mediated 
by these factors, with percent 
explained varying from 4% (NEET) 
to 70% (poor qualifications); in 
separate models for each mediator, 
the effect was mostly via cognition 
(percent explained range, 8%–67%; 
data not shown).
Neglect (prospective) and sexual 
abuse were associated with social 
mobility (Table 5). These groups 
were less likely to be upwardly 
mobile (move from manual to 
nonmanual class) both between 
and within generations (eg, neglect 
[prospective] OR, 0.45 [95% CI, 
0.39–0.53] and 0.61 [95% CI, 0.50–
0.74], respectively). The neglected 
(prospective) were also more likely 
to be downwardly mobile (move 
from nonmanual to manual class) 
between and within generations (OR, 
2.31 [95% CI, 1.56–3.41] and 2.11 
[95% CI, 1.63–2.74]). No clear social 
mobility patterns were found for 
nonsexual abuse.
DISCUSSION
In this population-based study 
of child maltreatment and adult 
socioeconomic outcomes, we showed 
two important findings. First, 
there were long-term associations 
of childhood abuse and neglect 
with unfavorable outcomes in 
midadulthood across a range of 
important socioeconomic indicators, 
such as LTS and lacking assets. 
Associations were mostly robust 
after adjustment for other early-
life factors, including social class 
and parental education, and risk of 
unfavorable outcomes increased 
with multiple types of maltreatment. 
Second, our study elucidates some 
important mechanisms underlying 
child maltreatment–adult outcome 
associations by showing that 
adolescent cognitive ability had 
a predominant mediating role in

neglect (prospective) associations 
with several adult outcomes, whereas 
cognition and mental health had 
negligible mediating effects for sexual 
and nonsexual abuse associations.
Our study has several strengths, 
including prospectively measured 
mediating factors and a range 
of socioeconomic outcomes. 
Potential confounding factors were 
also recorded prospectively (eg, 
family socioeconomic background 
[parental education, household 
tenure]). We cannot exclude 
the possibility of residual or 
uncontrolled confounding (eg, 
through inadequate measurement 
of relevant factors, such as parental 
cognitive capacities). Ascertainment 
of childhood maltreatment is not 
straightforward, with limitations 
noted for all methods, 
 
3 including 
those used here. Our neglect measure 
has the advantage of prospective 
ascertainment of some (failure 
to meet a child’s basic physical, 
emotional, or educational needs) 
but not all aspects (eg, inadequate 
nutrition) of the conventional 
definition. 
3 Multiple sources for 
neglect reporting (parent and 
teacher) may reduce misclassification, 
 
29 
and rather than relying on individual 
items, we used a composite score. 
Abuse by a parent up to 16 years was 
reported in adulthood; exclusion 
of abuse by others may lead to an 
underestimate of prevalence, and 
information is lacking on timing, 
frequency, and duration of abuse. 
Despite differences in study design, 
prevalence was generally within 
the ranges reported in a review 
3 
and were similar to another UK 
study.30 The study’s power to detect 
associations with sexual abuse 
was limited because there were 
few reported cases. Retrospective 
reports are common due to the lack 
of reliable alternative methods, 
 
3 but 
concerns remain about validity 
31 (eg, 
biases from rationalizing economic 
underachievement). 
32 In this regard, 
our sensitivity analyses replicating 
associations for outcomes 2 decades 
before retrospective reports suggests 
that such biases are unlikely to be a 
major explanation for associations. 
Construct validity of retrospective 
reports is suggested by previous 
work showing expected associations 
with prospectively assessed family 
dysfunction 
33 and poor mental 
health.11 Abuse was reported blind to 
knowledge of our research questions, 
and most midadult outcomes (6 of 7) 
were assessed 5 years later (at age 50 
years). Participants in midadulthood 
are generally representative of the 
surviving cohort 
20; we followed 
current guidelines for multiple 
imputation 
34 to avoid loss from 
missing data.
Our study demonstrates associations 
for a breadth of maltreatments and 
adult outcomes measured decades 
later in midadulthood. The range

of outcomes is important because 
there is no single measure of 
socioeconomic position; indicators 
reflect different, although often 
related, characteristics 
35 that may 
have specific limitations (eg, housing 
varies over time and geographically). 
The outcomes are important because 
of their costs to individuals and 
society; for example, in Britain, 
∼140 million working days per year 
are lost from sickness absence 
6 
and 1.68 million are unemployed. 
36 
LTS is associated with premature 
mortality 
15– 
17, and worklessness 
is associated with poor physical 
and mental health 
18 and with 
educational and economic outcomes 
in subsequent generations. 
37 
Therefore, reduction of LTS and 
unemployment are policy priorities.

7 
The timing of outcomes is also 
noteworthy; previous studies have 
examined socioeconomic outcomes 
in early adulthood 
38 or used mixed 
age samples,

outcomes suggests that the impact of 
childhood maltreatment persists over 
decades: to our knowledge, this has 
not been demonstrated previously. 
An individual is close to peak earning 
capacity at age 50 years in the 
United Kingdom 
39; poor outcomes 
at this age (eg, lacking assets) may 
presage hardship and associated 
poor health during old age. Patterns 
of association were generally 
consistent across maltreatment 
types, and when multiple types 
were examined cumulatively, the 
greatest maltreatment burden was 
associated with the greatest risk of 
unfavorable outcomes. Findings for 
LTS and NEET are consistent with 
other studies showing that greater 
exposure to adverse childhood 
experiences is linked to inability to 
work8 and unemployment 
8, 
 
9 in US 
mixed-age samples. The observed 
magnitude of maltreatment–outcome 
associations is not negligible when 
compared with other influences: 
ORs for LTS varied between 1.4 
to 2.3 for different maltreatments 
versus 2.2 for depression. 
40 With 
few exceptions, 
 
9 previous studies 
examine single (eg, sexual abuse38, 
 
41) 
or combined maltreatments without 
examining potential differential 
effects. 
8 Nevertheless, our 
findings generally agree with the 
literature, 
 
10, 
 
38, 
41, 
 
42 thereby adding 
credence to the growing evidence 
(especially given differences in 
maltreatment ascertainment methods). 
For example, the detrimental 
maltreatment associations with 
education, employment, and assets 
in our general population agree 
with those for documented (ie, 
more extreme) maltreatment. 
10 
Our witnessing abuse findings are 
novel; to our knowledge, this has not 
been examined, although witnessing 
parental violence has been associated 
with lower adult income. 
42 However, 
not all findings are consistent; for 
example, sexual abuse and education 
associations shown here agree with 
some 
43 but not all38 studies and 
sex differences 
10, 
 
41 in associations 
were not replicated. Child neglect 
and sexual abuse, but no other 
maltreatments, were associated 
with social class at 50 years and, 
interestingly, these groups were 
less likely to be upwardly mobile 
across and within generations. 
These findings are consistent with 
more general observations on 
disadvantaged groups having less 
favorable mobility patterns, and 
they are important given policy 
commitments to lowering poverty 
and increasing social mobility. 
44
With regard to potential mechanisms 
underlying child maltreatment–adult 
outcome associations, we found 
support for the mediating effects 
of adolescent cognitive abilities 
and mental health in associations 
for neglect (prospective), where a 
predominant effect was observed 
for cognition. Such findings are as 
expected from the evidence of deficits 
in cognitive abilities and behavioral 
adjustment among maltreated 
children, 
 
11 and the detrimental 
economic consequences related to 
these deficits. 
12 
– 
14 Our finding argues 
for support for remedial inputs for 
cognitive skills and the development 
of children who have been neglected, 
which may involve clinicians, child 
welfare, and other practitioners. 
Intriguingly, our results provide 
little support for the mediating 
effects of adolescent cognitive 
abilities or behavioral adjustment 
in the associations for sexual and 
nonsexual abuse. Explanations for this 
unexpected finding are not clear. Our 
cognitive and behavioral measures 
were prospectively assessed and of 
demonstrable relevance to neglect 
associations, but may not capture the 
most salient dimensions of abuse. 
Given these findings and the scarcity of 
other studies on potential mechanisms 
of child maltreatment–adult outcome 
associations, our study highlights 
the need for future research to 
confirm our results and to investigate 
additional mechanisms. This research 
is warranted to inform the direction 
of effective remedial strategies.
In conclusion, childhood abuse and 
neglect have long-term associations 
with detrimental outcomes in 
midadulthood, indicated by a range 
of socioeconomic measures. The 
risk of unfavorable outcome(s) was 
increased for those experiencing 
multiple types of maltreatment. 
Our findings suggest maltreated 
individuals grow up to experience 
socioeconomic disadvantage, which 
in turn may affect their health and 
that of the next generation. Our study 
therefore contributes to the evidence

base on the full long-term costs of 
child maltreatment, the elucidation 
of which is important to determine 
policy priorities. Prevention of 
maltreatment is a primary goal but 
represents an enormous challenge 
for which continued efforts are 
essential. In addition, investment in 
programs to alleviate the negative 
effects of maltreatment is needed. 
Our study suggests that one 
important target for action is the 
maximization of cognitive skills and 
development of neglected children.
