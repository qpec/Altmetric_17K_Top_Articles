ABSTRACT
Objective: Remission of pre-diabetes to normal is an
important health concern which has had little success
in the past. This study objective was to determine the
effect on remission of pre-diabetes with a high protein
(HP) versus high carbohydrate (HC) diet and effects on
metabolic parameters, lean and fat body mass in
prediabetic, obese subjects after 6 months of dietary
intervention.
Research design and methods: We recruited and
randomized 24 pre-diabetes women and men to either
a HP (30% protein, 30% fat, 40% carbohydrate; n=12)
or HC (15% protein, 30% fat, 55% carbohydrate;
n=12) diet feeding study for 6 months in this
randomized controlled trial. All meals were provided to
subjects for 6 months with daily food menus for HP or
HC compliance with weekly food pick-up and weight
measurements. At baseline and after 6 months on the
respective diets oral glucose tolerance and meal
tolerance tests were performed with glucose and
insulin measurements and dual energy X-ray
absorptiometry scans.
Results: After 6 months on the HP diet, 100% of the
subjects had remission of their pre-diabetes to normal
glucose tolerance, whereas only 33.3% of subjects on
the HC diet had remission of their pre-diabetes. The
HP diet group exhibited significant improvement in (1)
insulin sensitivity (p=0.001), (2) cardiovascular risk
factors (p=0.04), (3) inflammatory cytokines
(p=0.001), (4) oxidative stress (p=0.001), (5)
increased percent lean body mass (p=0.001) compared
with the HC diet at 6 months.
Conclusions: This is the first dietary intervention
feeding study, to the best of our knowledge, to report
100% remission of pre-diabetes with a HP diet and
significant improvement in metabolic parameters and
anti-inflammatory effects compared with a HC diet at
6 months.
Trial registration number: NCT0164284.
INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the
USA has increased dramatically in the last
decade. According to the Centers for Disease
Control
and
Prevention
(CDC)
National
Diabetes Statistics Report of 2014 there are
currently 29.1 million people with diabetes,
21 million are diagnosed and 8.1 million
undiagnosed.
The
prevalence
of
subjects
with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or
pre-diabetes is in excess of 86 million.1 The
Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)2 and
ACTNOW3 studies showed that the rate of
conversion for IGT to type 2 diabetes is 7–
10% per year with no significant difference
in ethnicity. The primary risk factor for type
2 diabetes is obesity as 90% are either
Significance of this study
What is already known about this subject?
▪ Reduction in caloric intake (without controlling
micronutrient content) for weight loss has gener-
ally not been successful for remission of pre-
diabetes (impaired glucose tolerance, IGT) to
normal glucose tolerance (NGT).
▪ Diabetic medications used to treat pre-diabetes
are not without side effects and require long-
term use.
What are the new findings?
▪ One hundred percent remission of pre-diabetes
IGT to NGT is obtained in obese adults using a
high protein (HP) diet but not a high carbohy-
drate (HC) diet.
▪ Increase in percent lean body mass and decrease
in percent fat body mass with weight loss is
obtained on the HP diet, but a decrease in percent
lean body mass and percent fat body mass with
weight loss on the HC diet in IGT subjects.
How might these results change the focus of
research or clinical practice?
▪ This study demonstrates that strict adherence to
dietary intervention with the HP diet is possible
and results in remission of pre-diabetes to NGT.
▪ The HP diet plans are adjustable with a wide
variety of different meal plans and initial instruc-
tions could be provided to the subjects along with
follow-up consultations by phone and email.

As
body
mass
index
(BMI)
increases from 23 to >35 kg/m2, there is a 93-fold
increase in type 2 diabetes. Obesity also increases the
risk of heart disease, hypertension and other metabolic
diseases.4 Lifestyle changes, including weight loss and
exercise, reduces the risk of developing diabetes by
58%,2 whereas therapeutic intervention reduces the risk
by 32% (metformin)2 and 72% (pioglitazone)3 in pre-
diabetes subjects. Few studies have been carried out to
show some remission of pre-diabetes (IGT) to normal
glucose tolerance with diets and weight loss.5 6
Our previous feeding study (all food provided) com-
paring a high protein (HP) diet in normal glucose toler-
ant,
obese,
premenopausal
women
showed
similar
weight loss over the 6 months. However, subjects on the
HP diet had a significant improvement in insulin sensi-
tivity, and decrease in cardiovascular risk (CVR) factors,
inflammatory markers, oxidative stress7 and increase in
GLP -1, GIP and gastrin8 at 6 months compared with the
HC diet subjects. Other diet studies have recommended
various methods for weight loss9–19 some of which sug-
gested advantages of low carbohydrate (CHO),15
16
higher fat17 or HP diets.18
Observations substantiate the validity of using a HP
diet for weight loss. Suppression of hunger and induce-
ment of satiety have been observed with the HP
diet.8 13 20 The thermic effect of feeding also increases
with protein primarily by the increase in protein synthe-
sis.21 The low glycemic index (GI) of foods high in pro-
teins
has
also
been
observed
to
be
a
factor
in
maintaining satiety. A high GI meal induces hypergly-
cemia which is followed a few hours later by the sensa-
tion of hypoglycemia and an earlier return of hunger.22
The diet composition can alter a number of other vari-
ables even though the weight loss may be the same with
an isocaloric HP versus a high carbohydrate (HC) diet.
The plasma lipids which are a major CVR factor can be
effected by the macronutrient diet composition.23 24 For
instance, a decrease in triglycerides was observed on a
low CHO diet.23 Protein intake by itself induces insulin
release; however, it is a much less potent secretagogue
for insulin than is glucose in normal individuals.25 This
suggests that HP diets may help preserve the β cells by
increasing sensitivity and decreasing insulin load per
meal.
Higher protein content in the diet may also help
maintain lean body mass.20 Studies showed nitrogen
balance remained positive after a hypocaloric HP diet
but became significantly negative after a hypocaloric HC
diet.26
Another important aspect of a HP diet is the anti-
inflammatory effect and decreased glucose area under
the curve (AUC) compared with a HC diet as was shown
in our previous study.7 Other studies have demonstrated
that hyperglycemia during glucose challenge or eleva-
tion of FFA27 leads to activation of leukocytes and react-
ive oxygen species (ROS). We have also shown that
hyperglycemia in vivo and in vitro activates T cells,
increases inflammatory cytokines, lipid peroxidation,
and ROS.28 Studies also have shown that hyperglycemia
in
type
2
diabetes
and
obesity
is
associated
with
increased inflammatory markers.29
In this diet feeding study, we investigated the effects of
a HP diet (30% kcals from protein, 40% kcals from
CHO and 30% kcals from fat) versus a HC diet (15%
kcals from protein, 55% kcals from CHO and 30% kcals
from fat) for 6 months on obese women and men with
pre-diabetes
with
restriction
of
500 kcal
intake/day
(based on resting metabolic rate (RMR)) on remission
of pre-diabetes to normal glucose tolerance, insulin sen-
sitivity, weight loss, changes in lean and fat body mass,
inflammatory markers and CVR factors.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Patients
We recruited women and men aged 20–50 years with a
BMI≥30 to ≤55 kg/m2 with pre-diabetes for a total of 24
participants. Subjects were selected on the basis of inclu-
sion criteria of age, BMI, fasting glucose of <126 mg/dL,
2-hour glucose level of 140–199 mg/dL during a stand-
ard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and glycated
hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 5.7–6.4%. They were excluded
if they had proteinuria or elevated serum creatinine
(>1.5 mg/dL),
surgical
or
premature
menopause,
history of liver disease, abnormal liver function tests, dia-
betes mellitus, on antidiabetic agents or insulin, thyroid
disease
with
abnormal
thyroid-stimulating
hormone
(TSH), weight >350 lbs, triglycerides >400 mg/dL, low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol >160 mg/dL, sys-
tolic blood pressure >145 or diastolic blood pressure
>100 mm, use of medications known to effect lipid or
glucose metabolism, pregnancy or the desire to become
pregnant in the next 6 months, weight loss of more than
5% of body weight in the past 6 months, smoked, or
history of cancer undergoing active treatment. After sub-
jects met the above criteria, they were asked to keep a
food diary for a week. Those found to be non-adherent
and unable to keep diet diary or deemed unable to
adhere to the protocol were excluded from the study.
Of the 233 subjects screened by phone, 178 signed
the consent form and were screened. Thirty-eight of
these subjects met all the inclusion criteria and were
randomized to a HP diet (18 subjects) versus HC diet
(20 subjects) for a period of 6 months. Six subjects in
the HP group and eight subjects in the HC group
dropped out within a few weeks after screening due to
their work schedule, driving distance or moved out of
area. Since there were no data (OGTT, MTT, dual
energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), weight, metabolic
markers) other than baseline (Bl) on those subjects that
dropped out, they were not included in the data analysis
of comparison of changes from Bl to 6 months on the
diet interventions. Therefore, 12 subjects in each group
completed the 6-month study as shown in figure 1 and
data analyzed.

 Study design
The study was a prospective randomized trial of a HP
diet (30% kcals from protein, 40% kcals from CHO,
30% kcals from fat) versus HC diet (15% kcals from
protein, 55% kcals from CHO, 30% kcals from fat) for a
period of 6 months. The study was approved by the
Institutional
Review
Board
of
the
University
of
Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC).
All participants were seen in the General Clinical
Research Center (GCRC) at UTHSC for all their visits.
After signing the consent form, a history and physical
examination, height and weight, blood pressure (BP)
and waist measurements were done. At the Bl and at
6 months of the study participants underwent a standard
OGTT and mixed meal tolerance test. The meal for the
MTT for the HP group was a HP meal and the meal for
the MTT for the HC group was a HC meal. Both HP and
HC meals were 300 calories (the same as the 75 g
OGTT). Glucose and insulin were measured at Bl and at
30 min intervals for 2 hours. These tests were repeated
after being on the diet for 6 months. Each provocative
test was performed after an overnight fast with 2 or more
days between tests. At Bl and 6 months, DXA scan, RMR,
chemistry profile, complete blood count (CBC), vitamin
D, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and lipid profiles were
performed. Urine collections for 24 hours were per-
formed for creatinine clearance (CrCl), microalbumin,
calcium (Ca) and urinary urea nitrogen (UUN). These
determinations
were
performed
to
determine
the
changes in body weight and body composition (lean
mass (LM) and fat mass (FM)), insulin sensitivity and
glucose response, lipid profile, Ca metabolism and
protein
breakdown
(by
urinalysis).
Subjects
were
assessed for level of activity and all were at minimum
activity.
Patients
were requested
to
continue
their
current level of physical activity throughout the study.
After meeting the screening criteria, subjects were ran-
domized to either the HP or HC diet using a permuted
block
randomization
method
generated
by
the
biostatistician.
Subjects were considered to have remission of their
pre-diabetes if at 6 months they had a fasting glucose of
<100 mg/dL, and a 2-hour glucose level of <140 mg/dL
during a single OGTT.

 Diet-related parameters
Diet composition
Study participants either followed a HP or HC diet for
6 months, based on initial randomization using a ran-
domization
table.
Calorie
maintenance
needs
were
determined on an individual basis using the RMR. After
maintenance, caloric needs were established for each
individual; 500 kcals/day were subtracted from the deter-
mined caloric needs to promote a 1–2 lbs weekly weight
loss. On average, an 1800 kcal/day diet for a 100 kg indi-
vidual was used to achieve adequate weight loss. A
one-time calorie reduction of 200 kcal was made if a
subject reached a plateau and did not lose weight for
two consecutive weeks during the 6 months. No subject
was on <1200 kcal/day.
A feeding study was necessary to ensure accurate
macronutrient consumption. The meals were dispensed
as prepackaged foods from stored frozen food by the
dietician affiliated with the UT GCRC dietary services on
the site of the GCRC, maintaining the macronutrient
and caloric requirements established at randomization.
Subjects were given three meals a day plus snacks
between meals. All foods were available at local grocery
stores and met the recommended daily intake (RDI)
of vitamins and mineral for women and men aged
20–50 years as assessed by the University of Minnesota
Nutrition Data System. Both the HP and HC diets con-
tained more than the RDI for Ca of 1000 mg/day for
women and men 20–50 years of age30 by providing an
average of 1725 and 1684 mg for HC and HP diets,
respectively. As the participants were obese and might
be at risk for diabetes mellitus and coronary heart
disease, it was prudent to ensure the participants follow
a healthy diet that could minimize their health risks. For
example, dietary fat sources focused on monounsatu-
rated and polyunsaturated fats, that is, plant oils, semi-
liquid
margarine,
nuts;31–33
dietary
CHO
sources
emphasized whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes;
and dietary protein sources included lean meats, fish,
chicken, eggs and non-fat dairy foods, that is, fat-free
milk and low-fat cheese. The dietary principles are con-
sistent with the guidelines of the Institute of Medicine32
and American Diabetes Association.34
Diet compliance
For our feeding, study participants were given detailed
instructions during the prestudy orientation at screening
visits. A variety of foods with the same macronutrients
were offered to increase choices and adherence. After
choosing their preferences for meals and snacks, they
were instructed to adhere to the diet to which they were
assigned. All food was provided to the participants who
came in weekly to pick-up their food and daily menu
food
record
for
the week
and
weight
checks
for
6 months. The participants were required to turn in
their record when they returned for the next food
pick-up to check for compliance of diet adherence.
We used frequent interaction, behavior modification,
individualized diet with food variety and food record
systems which have been shown to increase dietary com-
pliance. The food records served as a ‘motivational
enforcement’. Recording dietary intake emphasized the
importance of the diet as a key component to the
study.35 Compliance was assessed by objective and sub-
jective parameters which included weekly subject contact
and detailed review of their food diaries.
DXA assessment of body composition
Hologic Discovery QDR Bone Densitometer (V.8.3) was
used to measure body composition by measurements of
the entire body. DXA measurements were performed at
Bl and 6 months. Body composition, LM composition,
FM, and bone mineral content were assessed.7 The DXA
Quality Assurance manual for the GCRC was used to
standardize patient positioning and scan analysis.
Resting metabolic rate
Indirect calorimetry was used to assess RMR of each par-
ticipant at the beginning of the study to determine the
caloric intake for the diets for each subject and at
6 months to determine changes in their metabolic rate.
A Cardio Coach (Korr Medical Technologies) was used
for the determination of the RMR. The subjects after
an overnight (10-hour) fast were at absolute rest in a
reclining position for 15 min after which respiratory
exchanges were measured continuously for 15 min meas-
uring oxygen consumption and CO2 production to
determine the RMR.7 36
Laboratory procedures
Determination of plasma metabolic hormones, cytokines,
markers of CVRs, and lipids
Glucose and insulin levels for the OGTT and MTT were
measured at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min and AUC calcu-
lated for Bl and 6 months. Insulin, inflammatory cytokines
(tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α and interleukin (IL)-6),
CVR factors (BP
, triglycerides, LDL, high-density lipopro-
tein,
cholesterol,
BMI),
adiponectin,
oxidative
stress
(ROS) (dichlorofluorescein (DCF)), β-hydroxybutyrate,
HbA1c were measured using our previously established
methods.7 29 Coefficient of variation of the assays were all
<5%.
CBC with diff and chemistry metabolic profile, TSH,
cortisol, UUN and other tests to exclude chemical and
metabolic abnormalities and protein balance were deter-
mined by standard laboratory procedures. Protein and
muscle mass catabolism were assessed via 24-hour UUN,
CrCl and Ca at Bl and at 6 months. Ca balance was
assessed by 24-hour urine Ca excretion as well as serum
Ca, 25 OH-vitamin D and PTH, at Bl and 6 months. BMI
and waist were measured by standard methods.
Insulin sensitivity
The HOMA IR and insulin sensitivity index (ISI; using
the
Matsuda
index)
were
calculated
as

 described from plasma glucose and insulin measure-
ments obtained during the 2-hour OGTT.3 7
Statistical analysis
The primary outcomes examined were remission of pre-
diabetes, markers of insulin sensitivity, CVR factors,
inflammatory cytokines and change in lean and fat body
mass from Bl to 6 months. Initially, change was com-
pared between the two arms using Wilcoxon rank-sum
test to compare the effects of the two diets. In addition,
Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare Bl and
6 months data to assess effects of each diet.
To assess the effectiveness of randomization, Wilcoxon
rank-sum test was used to compare Bl variables between
the two arms. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically
significant. If important Bl differences were identified,
they were included in analysis using generalized linear
models.
All analyses were conducted using SAS V.9.3 (SAS
Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). Results are pre-
sented as mean±SE. Statistical significance was declared
if the two-sided p value was <0.05. The study was
designed to recruit 12 subjects in each arm. Power ana-
lysis was performed according to two scenarios at 5%
significance level. In the first objective, the changes were
compared between the two arms. Assuming the Bl to
follow-up correlation is 0.25 and the effect size (the ratio
of variance of interaction effects to within cell variance)
is 0.40, interaction effects could be tested with at least
80% power. Just as important, in the absence of inter-
action effects, focus was shifted on assessing marginal
treatment arm differences. Assuming again the Bl to
follow-up correlation is 0.25 and an effect size of 0.80
(ratio of mean weight change to within SD), the
changes could be tested with at least 80% power. Note
that extended models having Bl covariates should lead
to greater statistical power under both scenarios.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the mean and SE of various parameters
monitored on the 12 HP and 12 HC diet subjects from
Bl through 6 months and the significant difference of
changes of the parameters in the subjects on the HP
and HC diets. At Bl, the HP and HC groups were not
statistically different. Of great significance is the 100%
(12/12) remission of pre-diabetes to normal glucose tol-
erance in all the HP diet group subjects; whereas, there
was only a 33% (4/12) remission in the HC group.

 Subjects on the HP and HC had significant weight loss
at 6 months from their Bl weights but not significantly
different between the HP and HC groups at 6 months.
HbA1c and insulin sensitivity (HOMA IR and ISI) were
all significantly improved at 6 months from Bl in the HP
and HC diets; however, the HP group had significantly
greater improvement in these parameters compared
with the HC group at 6 months. The CVR factors (BP
,
cholesterol,
triglycerides,

and
inflammation
markers (TNFα, IL-6) were significantly decreased in
both diet groups; however, the HP diet resulted in sig-
nificantly greater reduction in the triglycerides, LDL,
oxidative stress (ROS-DCF), TNFα, and IL-6 compared
with the HC diet at 6 months. This reduction in TNFα,
IL-6 demonstrates a better anti-inflammatory effect of
the HP diet compared with the HC diet.
Figure 2 A–D shows the mean±SD for glucose and
insulin values for the OGTT and MTT for the HP and
HC diet groups. There was no significant difference of
the Bl HP versus HC glucose or insulin AUC for the
OGTTs. OGTT glucose and insulin AUCs for the HP
and HC diet groups were both significantly less at
6 months compared with Bl. Importantly, the OGTT
glucose and insulin AUCs for the HP diet were signifi-
cantly less than the HC diet at 6 months, showing a
greater improvement in glucose disposal and insulin sen-
sitivity with the HP diet than the HC diet. The MTT HP
versus HC glucose (p=0.01) and HP versus HC insulin
(p=0.001) AUCs at Bl were significantly different dem-
onstrating
the
difference
in
glycemic
and
insulin
responses to the HP versus HC meal of the same caloric
intake (300 kcal). Glucose and insulin AUCs for the HP
and HC diets at 6 months were significantly less than at
Bl. Additionally, the glucose and insulin AUCs for the
HP MTT were significantly less than the glucose and
insulin AUCs of the HC MTT after 6 months on the
respective diets again demonstrating greater glucose dis-
posal and improved insulin sensitivity with the HP diet.
Ketones were monitored by β-hydroxybutyrate determin-
ation on fasting blood during the study. β-Hydroxybutyrate
for both groups showed no significant difference at
6 months from Bl and no significant difference between
groups and demonstrated no significant ketosis induced
by the diets. All parameters on the chemistry profile and
CBC were in the normal range at Bl and 6 months.
UUN increased significantly in the HP group from Bl to
6 months (8.5±2 to 17±2 g/24 hour) compared with no
increase in the HC group (8.6±2 to 8.7±1.5 g/24 hour)
verifying the HP group was consuming their HP diet.
Neither 25-OH vitamin D, PTH, CrCl, microalbumin,
serum or urinary Ca levels changed significantly in
either the HP or HC group from Bl to 6 months (data
not shown).
Figure 3 shows the percent LM and FM changes in
the HP and HC groups. The HP group had a significant
percent LM increase with a significant decrease in
percent FM from Bl to 6 months on the HP diet.
However, the HC group had a significant decrease in
both the percent LM and FM from Bl to 6 months on
the HC diet.

 CONCLUSIONS
There are several important findings of this study which
previously have not been reported. (1) The HP diet
resulted in 100% remission of pre-diabetes to normal
glucose tolerance while the HC diet resulted in only
33% remission. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first lifestyle intervention study where 100% remission of
pre-diabetes was obtained. Our results show that high
efficacy can be achieved with dietary modification if
parameters are rigorously controlled and monitored. (2)
The HP group had greater improvement in insulin sensi-
tivity, greater reduction in CVR factors, oxidative stress
(ROS) and inflammation than the HC diet group. (3)
The HP diet group’s percent lean body mass (LM)
increased
while
percent
body
FM
was
decreased;
whereas, the HC diet group lost both percent LM and
FM. (4) There was no physical activity modification
during the 6 months on the diets, and since all subjects
were minimally physically active, we were able to study
the direct effect of the HP versus HC diets. (5) Diet
meals were given to each patient weekly at our CRC
along with survey of food consumption which resulted
in a high level of compliance (>90%; table 1).
The HC group sustained higher glucose and insulin
levels with both the OGTTs and MTTs compared with
the HP diet group after 6 months on the diet. The
greater insulin response with the HC diet likely equates
to greater β cells stress. The higher sustained glucose
elevation with ingestion of glucose or higher glycemic
foods as in the HC diet correlates with increased oxida-
tive stress and inflammation in the HC group compared
with the HP group as our data show. A study showed
antioxidant enzymes induced by repeated intake of
excess energy in the form of high-fat, HC diets are not
sufficient to block oxidative stress and inflammation in
healthy human subjects.37 Thus, the fact that our HP
diet had a significantly greater reduction in ROS and
inflammation markers than the HC diet in pre-diabetes
subjects is of great health importance.
Although both HP and HC diet subjects did minimal
exercise activity, the percent LM was preserved in the
HP group while FM was lost. This preservation of
percent LM in the HP diet group may be an important
factor in improving insulin sensitivity since muscle is a
major insulin sensitive tissue for glucose uptake. Since
exercise builds muscle mass, it would be of interest to
know if the subjects had been on an exercise pro-
gramme if the LM would be conserved in the HC group
or if there could be a greater increase in the LM in the
HP group with exercise in conjunction with the LM pre-
serving effect of a HP diet.26 38
Although some studies have reported a HP diet can
cause negative Ca balance, increased Ca loss in the
urine and adversely affect the bone,39 our HP and HC
diets
contained
more
than
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(FDA)
recommended
amount
of
Ca/day30 and showed no bone loss or loss of Ca in the
urine.40 The protein composition in our HP diet was
30% which is at the upper limit of suggested protein
consumption range (10–30%). This may not be at a
high enough percentage to cause a negative Ca balance
as has been reported.
A possible limitation is assessment of insulin sensitivity
by HOMA-IR with the African-American(AA) subjects;41
however, the majority of the subjects in our study were
AA and neither Bl HOMA-IR nor ISI (Matsuda index)
was significantly different between the HP and HC
groups.
Also,
both
methods
of
assessment
showed
greater improvement of insulin sensitivity with the HP
diet than the HC diet at 6 months.
Diet compliance is an important factor in macronutri-
ent composition diet studies. Most studies rely on a
patient’s recall food questionnaire of meals they ate days
to weeks before which is generally inaccurate. Strengths
of this feeding study are that it was a randomized control
trial where all food and daily diet plans were provided to
each subject in the HP and HC diet groups at their
weekly visit to the CRC along with daily food consump-
tion survey each week for 6 months. This monitoring
resulted in >90% compliance of diet adherence. Our
study demonstrates for the first time that strict adherence
of dietary intervention is possible and can produce mean-
ingful and reliable results and remission of pre-diabetes.
At an additional 6-month follow-up visit after 6 months
on the diet study, the subjects that chose to stay on the
HP diet plans purchasing their own food and with consul-
tations with the investigators when needed maintained
their weight loss and normal glucose levels.
The daily cost of such a diet (HP or HC) was about
$13 a day with minimal personnel involvement (except
for weekly pick-up of diet supplies). The diet plans are
adjustable to the subjects food likes and dislike with a
wide variety of choices with different meal plans for
each day of the week. Weekly meal plans and initial
instructions could be provided to the subject and phone
and email consultation provided when needed. By this
method, the HP diet plan would allow for a diet care
