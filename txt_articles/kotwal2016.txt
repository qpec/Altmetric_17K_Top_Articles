IMPORTANCE The term golden hour was coined to encourage urgency of trauma care. In
2009, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates mandated prehospital helicopter transport of
critically injured combat casualties in 60 minutes or less.
OBJECTIVES To compare morbidity and mortality outcomes for casualties before vs after the
mandate and for those who underwent prehospital helicopter transport in 60 minutes or less
vs more than 60 minutes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective descriptive analysis of battlefield data
examined 21 089 US military casualties that occurred during the Afghanistan conflict from
September 11, 2001, to March 31, 2014. Analysis was conducted from September 1, 2014, to
January 21, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Data for all casualties were analyzed according to whether
they occurred before or after the mandate. Detailed data for those who underwent
prehospital helicopter transport were analyzed according to whether they occurred before or
after the mandate and whether they occurred in 60 minutes or less vs more than 60 minutes.
Casualties with minor wounds were excluded. Mortality and morbidity outcomes and
treatment capability–related variables were compared.
RESULTS For the total casualty population, the percentage killed in action (16.0% [386 of
2411] vs 9.9% [964 of 9755]; P < .001) and the case fatality rate ([CFR] 13.7 [469 of 3429] vs
7.6 [1344 of 17 660]; P < .001) were higher before vs after the mandate, while the percentage
died of wounds (4.1% [83 of 2025] vs 4.3% [380 of 8791]; P = .71) remained unchanged.
Decline in CFR after the mandate was associated with an increasing percentage of casualties
transported in 60 minutes or less (regression coefficient, –0.141; P < .001), with projected vs
actual CFR equating to 359 lives saved. Among 4542 casualties (mean injury severity score,
17.3; mortality, 10.1% [457 of 4542]) with detailed data, there was a decrease in median
transport time after the mandate (90 min vs 43 min; P < .001) and an increase in missions
achieving prehospital helicopter transport in 60 minutes or less (24.8% [181 of 731] vs 75.2%
[2867 of 3811]; P < .001). When adjusted for injury severity score and time period, the
percentage killed in action was lower for those critically injured who received a blood
transfusion (6.8% [40 of 589] vs 51.0% [249 of 488]; P < .001) and were transported in 60
minutes or less (25.7% [205 of 799] vs 30.2% [84 of 278]; P < .01), while the percentage died
of wounds was lower among those critically injured initially treated by combat support
hospitals (9.1% [48 of 530] vs 15.7% [86 of 547]; P < .01). Acute morbidity was higher among
those critically injured who were transported in 60 minutes or less (36.9% [295 of 799] vs
27.3% [76 of 278]; P < .01), those severely and critically injured initially treated at combat
support hospitals (severely injured, 51.1% [161 of 315] vs 33.1% [104 of 314]; P < .001; and
critically injured, 39.8% [211 of 530] vs 29.3% [160 of 547]; P < .001), and casualties who
received a blood transfusion (50.2% [618 of 1231] vs 3.7% [121 of 3311]; P < .001),
emphasizing the need for timely advanced treatment.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A mandate made in 2009 by Secretary of Defense Gates
reduced the time between combat injury and receiving definitive care. Prehospital transport
time and treatment capability are important factors for casualty survival on the battlefield.

M
inimizing time between critical injury and defini-
tive care has long been a hallmark and metric of
trauma systems, particularly in war, where devas-
tating injuries result in death occurring predominantly be-
fore hospital arrival.1-3 Despite advances in battlefield trauma
systems, especially in prehospital care,4-6 there are still po-
tentially preventable deaths associated largely with torsal
exsanguination.3,7 Thus, efficient and effective use of prehos-
pital helicopter transport, and associated en route care, are of
paramount importance.
Prehospital transport time was reduced from 10 hours in
World War II to 5 hours in the Korean conflict to 1 hour in the
Vietnam conflict,8 primarily owing to helicopters, which were
first used in the Korean conflict.9-12 Although helicopters are
vulnerable to hostile fire and risk of crashing during unfavor-
able environmental conditions, their advantages of range and
speed across difficult terrain and ability to land in small areas
permitted more rapid prehospital transport and potential re-
duction of morbidity and mortality in critically wounded
casualties.11
Rapid helicopter evacuation continued to influence sur-
vival from combat trauma during the Vietnam conflict,13,14
which solidified the role of helicopters for prehospital battle-
fieldtransportandconvincedsurgeonsreturningfromthecon-
flict to use helicopters in civilian practice along with trauma
centersandregionaltraumasystems.Therearenowmorethan
250 civilian helicopter programs in the United States and as
many as 1000 worldwide.
Recognizing that trauma patients reaching definitive care
sooner had a better chance for survival, one prior military sur-
geon, R Adams Cowley, established Baltimore’
s Shock Trauma
Center and a statewide system of care served by Maryland po-
lice helicopters piloted by Vietnam veterans. He also coined
the well-known term golden hour to promote this urgency be-
tweeninjuryandcare.15Despitegeneralagreementthatprompt
access to appropriate care is essential for the critically in-
jured, evidence-based validation of the golden hour has re-
mained elusive.15-21
In addition to speed, helicopters provided opportunity for
earlier advanced care. Although small helicopters used dur-
ing the Korean conflict could carry only patients, larger heli-
copters used in the Vietnam conflict also carried flight med-
ics with basic training. While these medics provided favorable
care within their scope of practice, recent US military use of
critical care–trained flight paramedics and UK military use of
medical teams (physician, nurse, and paramedics) on helicop-
ters in Afghanistan demonstrated casualty survival benefit
from advanced expertise and capability delivered earlier
through en route care.22-25 Nearly all civilian medical helicop-
terprogramshavealreadyintegratedadvancedhealthcarepro-
fessionals and capability.
With the premise that battlefield casualties would gain ad-
ditional benefit from further reduced time between injury and
care and a firm belief that 1 hour was a matter of morale and
moral obligation to the troops, on June 15, 2009, Secretary of
Defense Robert M. Gates mandated a standard of 60 minutes
or less, from call to arrival at the treatment facility, for pre-
hospitalhelicoptertransportofUSmilitarycasualtieswithcriti-
cal injuries,26 cutting in half the previous goal of 2 hours,27 and
aligning with the concept of the golden hour. To provide novel
insights for military and civilian trauma systems, this study
evaluated compliance with this new mandate for prehospital
helicopter transport in 60 minutes or less and described pa-
tient injury, treatment, and transport time relative to morbid-
ity and mortality outcomes.
Methods
A retrospective descriptive analysis of US military combat
casualties in Afghanistan from September 11, 2001, to March
31, 2014, was performed as a quality improvement project.
Non–US military personnel were excluded because data,
especially for follow-up, were not available or reliable. Analy-
sis was conducted from September 1, 2014, to January 21,
2015. This study met US Army Institute of Surgical Research
regulatory requirements.
Tocomparecombatcasualties,bothwoundedinactionand
killed in action (KIA), according to whether they occurred be-
fore or after the mandate and with other conflicts, aggregate
data for the total population were obtained from the Depart-
ment of Defense Manpower Data Center and analyzed using 4
combat casualty care statistical definitions: (1) percentage re-
turned to duty in 72 hours or less (RTD), (2) percentage KIA,
(3) percentage died of wounds (DOW), and (4) case fatality rate
(CFR).28,29 Casualties who underwent prehospital helicopter
transportwerefurtherevaluated.However,casualtieswithmi-
nor wounds (categorized as RTD) were excluded because they
appropriately lacked urgency for transport. Prehospital flight
data, including time stamps (injury, aircraft call, launch, scene
arrival, and arrival at treatment facility), were matched with
Department of Defense Trauma Registry casualty data and
Armed Forces Medical Examiner autopsy data and catego-
rized (≤60 minutes vs >60 minutes) based on overall helicop-
ter mission time from call to arrival at the treatment facility.
Threeprimaryoutcomesofmortalityweremeasured:over-
allmortalityandits2components,KIAmortalityandDOWmor-
tality. Four secondary outcomes of acute morbidity as identi-
fied by treatment facility–documented complications or
InternationalClassificationofDiseases,NinthRevisioncodeswere
also measured: amputation, cardiac arrest, coagulopathy, and
shock. Demographic and injury-related variables included age,
sex,militaryinjuryseverityscore(ISS),mechanismofinjury(ex-
plosion,gunshot,blunttrauma,orother),andprimarybodyre-
gion injured (head, neck, chest, abdomen, extremity, or exter-
nal). Treatment-related variables included blood transfusion
(massivetransfusion[MT],nonmassivetransfusion[NMT],pre-
hospital transfusion [PHT]) and type of initial receiving treat-
ment facility (forward surgical team or combat support hospi-
tal[CSH]ortheirequivalents). Massivetransfusionisdefinedas
10 U or more of packed red blood cells administered within the
first 24 hours following injury. Injury severity score groupings
are per American College of Surgeons guidelines.30
Outcome differences were assessed using χ2 significance
testing. Trends for CFR vs percentage of casualties trans-
ported in 60 minutes or less were analyzed by applying regres-

a Updated data for Iraq and Afghanistan (September 11, 2001, to March 31,
2014) were obtained from the Defense Casualty Analysis System.28
Definitions and historic World War II and Vietnam data were obtained from
Holcomb and colleagues.29 A variance from Holcomb and colleagues is that
we do not include Battalion Aid Station in the definition of medical treatment
facility as it is a prehospital entity that lacks true major surgical capability.
bDefines minor wounds and calculated as follows: % RTD = [(RTD/WIA) × 100].
The difference between Afghanistan values before vs after the mandate was
significant (χ2
1 = 80.822; P < .001) and indicates more minor wounds after the
mandate.
c Comparison is significant before vs after the mandate (P < .05) using χ2 with
Yates correction.
dProvides a potential measure of weapon lethality, effectiveness of prehospital
medical care, and availability of prehospital transport and calculated as follows:
% KIA = {KIA/[KIA + (WIA – RTD)] × 100}. The total Afghanistan value appears
lower compared with previous conflicts. The difference between Afghanistan
values before vs after the mandate was significant (χ2
1 = 56.481; P < .001).
e Provides a potential measure of the precision of initial prehospital triage and
care, optimization of evacuation procedures, and application of a coordinated
trauma system, as well as the effectiveness of medical treatment facility care
and calculated as follows: % DOW = {[DOW/(WIA – RTD)] × 100}. The total
Afghanistan value appears lower compared with the Iraq value, but higher than
the Vietnam and World War II values. The difference between Afghanistan
values before vs after the mandate was not significant (χ2
1 = 0.136; P = .71).
f Provides a potential measure of overall battlefield lethality in a battle injury
population and calculated as follows: CFR = [(KIA + DOW)/(KIA + WIA) ×
100]. The total Afghanistan value appears lower compared with previous
conflicts. The difference between Afghanistan values before vs after the
mandate was significant (χ2
1 = 108.465; P < .001).

Table 2 and Table 3 show results for casualties with suffi-
cient data for additional individual-level analysis. As data
were available for only 37.3% (4542 of 12 166) of the popula-
tion, the study was limited to descriptive analyses using
cross-tabulations. Among these 4542 casualties (4480 male
[98.6%]; mean [SD] age, 25.4 [5.5] years; and 4085 survivors
[89.9%]), 3048 [67.1%] experienced helicopter evacuation in
60 minutes or less.

Transport Time and Injuries
Compared with transport time before the mandate, reduc-
tions in prehospital transport time were seen across all time
intervalsafterthemandate(P ≤ .002),witha52%medianover-
all transport time reduction from 90 minutes to 43 minutes
(P < .001)andanincreaseinprehospitaltransportmissionsthat
achievedtransporttimesof60minutesorless(beforetheman-
date, 24.8% [181 of 731]; after the mandate, 75.2% [2867 of
3811]; P < .001). Patients with transport times of 60 minutes
or less had higher mortality (10.9% [331 of 3048] vs 8.4% [126
of 1494]; P = .01) and acute morbidity (18.7% [571 of 3048] vs
11.2% [168 of 1494]; P < .001) compared with those whose
transport times were longer than 60 minutes. However, these
patients also tended to have injuries with higher ISS (mean,
18.5 vs 14.9; P = .01) as well as a higher prevalence of chest in-
juries (11.0% [335 of 3048] vs 7.8% [116 of 1494]; P < .001), ab-
dominal injuries (8.3% [253 of 3048] vs 6.5% [97 of 1494];
P = .03), and explosive blast injuries (69.2% [2110 of 3048] vs
56.6% [845 of 1494]; P < .001).
Treatment Capabilities
Differences were observed in capability-related variables of
blood transfusion and initial treatment facility. The percent-
age of patients who received MT (7.3% [53 of 731] vs 14.0% [532
of3811];P < .001),NMT(11.9%[87of731]vs14.7%[559of3811];
P = .05), and PHT (0% [0 of 731] vs 3.5% [132 of 3811]; P < .001)
was greater after the mandate. Similarly, patients who re-
ceived MT (15.5% [471 of 3048] vs 7.6% [114 of 1494]; P < .001),
NMT (16.4% [500 of 3048] vs 9.8% [146 of 1494]; P < .001), and
PHT (4.0% [121 of 3048] vs 0.7% [11 of 1494]; P < .001) were
more likely to have had transport times of 60 minutes or less.
In addition, the percentage of patients who were delivered ini-
tially to a CSH (42.4% [310 of 731] vs 48.0% [1828 of 3811];
P = .006) was greater after the mandate.
Injuries and Outcomes
Unadjusted data showed no difference before vs after the man-
date in overall mortality (9.8% [72 of 731] vs 10.1% [385 of 3811],
respectively; P = .83), an increase in KIA mortality (4.9% [36
of 731] vs 7.2% [274 of 3811]; P = .03), and a decrease in DOW
mortality (4.9% [36 of 731] vs 2.9% [111 of 3811]; P = .005). Mor-
bidity also differed because the total percentage of amputa-
tions (7.3% [53 of 731] vs 13.3% [506 of 3811]; P < .001) and am-
putationsofthelowerextremity(5.6%[41of731]vs12.0%[458
of 3811]; P < .001) were more common after the mandate, and
coagulopathy (10.5% [77 of 731] vs 7.4% [281 of 3811]; P = .004)
was more common before the mandate. Since mortality out-
comes among this detailed sample were either unchanged or
opposite those observed in Table 1 for the total population,
these unadjusted numbers do not account for ISS and are likely
conservative and biased toward the null from underrepresen-
tation of KIA deaths in the detailed sample, particularly in the
period before the mandate.
Figure 2 shows KIA mortality, DOW mortality, and acute
morbidity by type of treatment facility, type of blood transfu-
sion, and transport time, adjusted for ISS and whether the in-
jury time period was before or after the mandate. The rate of
KIA mortality was lower for critically injured who received a
blood transfusion (6.8% [40 of 589] vs 51.0% [249 of 488];
P < .001), lower for severely and critically injured casualties
who received MT (0% [0 of 169] vs 4.7% [12 of 253]; P < .001;
and 3.2% [12 of 372] vs 51.0% [249 of 488], respectively;
P < .001),criticallyinjuredcasualtieswhoreceivedNMT(12.9%
[28 of 217] vs 51.0% [249 of 488]; P < .001), and critically in-
jured casualties who were transported in 60 minutes or less
(25.7% [205 of 799] vs 30.2% [84 of 278]; P < .01). The rate of
DOW mortality was lower for critically injured casualties ini-
tially treated at a CSH (9.1% [48 of 530] vs 15.7% [86 of 547];
P < .01). Those receiving PHT had a lower rate of KIA mortal-
ity (2.3% [3 of 132] vs 7.0% [308 of 4410]; P = .04) and no dif-
ference in rate of DOW mortality. Acute morbidity was higher
forcriticallyinjuredcasualtieswhoweretransportedin60min-
utes or less (36.9% [295 of 799] vs 27.3% [76 of 278]; P < .01),
for severely injured and critically injured casualties initially
treated at a CSH (51.1% [161 of 315] vs 33.1% [104 of 314];
P < .001; and 39.8% [211 of 530] vs 29.3% [160 of 547], respec-
tively; P < .001), and for all ISS casualty groups who received
blood transfusions (50.2% [618 of 1231] vs 3.7% [121 of 3311];
P < .001), which emphasizes the need for rapid transport and
advanced treatment capabilities. For critically injured casu-
alties, the estimated number needed to treat to prevent KIA
mortality for those receiving MT, NMT, or PHT compared with
similar casualties who received no blood transfusion was 2 (1/
[249 of 488] – [12 of 372]), 3 (1/[249 of 488] – [28 of 217]), and

The data provide 12 cases labeled as KIA who also received a massive transfusion;
although these cases were dead on arrival to an MTF, heroic measures were
undertaken. For blood transfusion, sample sizes were too small to evaluate
prehospital transfusion (PHT) using the Cochrane-Mantel-Haenszel test. However,
KIA mortality, DOW mortality, and acute morbidity (defined by presence of
amputation, cardiac arrest, coagulopathy, and/or shock) were compared between
patients who received PHT (n = 132) and patients who did not (n = 4410). Of
patients who received PHT, 2.3% (3 of 132) were KIA, while 7.0% (308 of 4410) of
patients who did not receive PHT were KIA (χ2
1 = 4.460; P = .04). Of patients who
received PHT, 5.3% (7 of 132) were DOW, while 3.2% (141 of 4410) of patients who
did not receive PHT were DOW (χ2
1 = 1.803; P = .18). Of patients who received PHT,
80.3% (106 of 132) experienced acute morbidity, while 14.4% (633 of 4410) of
patients who did not receive PHT experienced acute morbidity (χ2
1 = 409.175;
P < .001). Statistical comparisons are based on the Cochrane-Mantel-Haenszel test
with adjustment for ISS and injury time period (before vs after the mandate).

lation regardless of ISS, the estimated number needed to treat
to prevent KIA mortality for those receiving MT, NMT, and PHT
was 17 (1/[264 of 3311] – [12 of 585]), 39 (1/[264 of 331] – [35 of

Discussion
Timeandtreatmentcapabilityareimportantfactorsforthesur-
vival of critically injured casualties. In the civilian sector, in-
creased prehospital capability and expertise, as well as rapid
transport to surgical and hospital care, have been shown to im-
prove trauma outcomes.31-37 Within the Department of De-
fense, advances in prehospital initiatives are subject to frag-
mented ownership and decision making. Decisions are made
or deferred by any number of leaders at any level within the
chain of command.38 The 2009 Secretary of Defense man-
date of a prehospital medical practice is unique. It sent a clear
message affirming ownership, priority, and intent that trans-
lated into practice and compliance, as evidenced by the shift
from24.8%to75.2%ofmissionsachievingtransportin60min-
utes or less.
Althoughchallengingtomeasureandsubjecttoconfound-
ing, secondary effects resulting from the mandate that con-
tributed to achieving the mandated time included stream-
lined authority and helicopter launch procedures, increased
number and dispersion of Army helicopters, and the addition
of Air Force helicopters to assist with the Army prehospital
transport mission. As decreased time from critical injury to
treatment capability was the underlying goal, personnel with
increased expertise (blood transfusion protocol–trained ba-
sic medics, critical care paramedics, and critical care nurses)
were trained and assigned to prehospital flights more rou-
tinely, resulting in earlier availability of blood products and
other advanced care.
In addition, an increase in the number and dispersion of
small but mobile forward surgical teams across the battle-
field brought major surgical capability even closer to the point
of injury and provided an alternative to transporting patients
longer distances to large, but less mobile, civilian trauma cen-
ter–equivalent CSHs. However, as we found DOW mortality to
belowerforcriticallyinjuredcasualtiesinitiallytreatedatCSHs,
future detailed study is needed for comprehensive compari-
son of the capabilities and outcome differences between fa-
cility types.
In our study, prehospital helicopter transport time short-
ened, affording critical casualties who would have previ-
ously died in the field the opportunity to receive en route and
facility-based care. Other critical casualties who previously
would have died in treatment facilities were also afforded care
earlier. Moreover, the observed reduction in KIA mortality was
not accompanied by a proportional change in DOW mortality,
suggesting that rapid evacuation combined with earlier en
route and facility-based care resulted in survival but with risk
for attendant morbidity or DOW mortality status. In sum-
mary, as transport time decreased and capabilities increased,
casualties who would previously have been in the KIA mor-
talitygroupsurvivedoutrightorsurvivedlongenoughthatthey
shifted to the DOW mortality group, and casualties who would
previously have been in the DOW mortality group were also
surviving.Decreasingthetimefrominjurytoarrivalatthetreat-
ment facility challenged the full measure of the trauma sys-
tem with more critically injured casualties who then ben-
efited from the care they received.
From the total casualty population, our study showed a
significant survival benefit after the mandate, specifically as
a result of a reduction in KIA mortality. An increase in injuries
from explosions and amputations of the lower extremity in the
period after the mandate also conveyed the changing nature
of the etiologic factors of injury and the increased severity and
complexity of wounds as the war evolved. As the prevailing
mechanism of injury shifted from gunshot to explosion, it was
accompanied by an inherent ability to generate multiple com-
plex blast-related casualties with higher ISS.
Our finding that median transport time was reduced by
52% after the mandate is notable, especially given the war-
time conditions in which the reduction was achieved. A meta-
analysis and 30-year review of civilian trauma prehospital
transport showed an overall 73-minute mean helicopter am-
bulance time for the interval between activation and hospital
arrival.32 Our study, which evaluated a helicopter evacuation
system established and maintained by the US military for more
than a decade in a hostile region more than 7000 miles away,
also showed an overall 73-minute mean.
Evidence from the published literature shows that civil-
ian patients with severe injury, particularly penetrating, tho-
racic, and brain trauma, benefit from more rapid evacua-
tion.34-36 McCoy et al35 noted that patients with penetrating
traumaandISSgreaterthan15hadincreasedmortalitywithlon-
ger total prehospital transport times. Kidher and colleagues34
found that patients with thoracic trauma and high ISS had re-
duced mortality associated with total prehospital transport
times of less than 65 minutes. Dinh et al36 noted that patients
with severe head injuries had improved functional outcomes
withatotalprehospitaltransporttimeof60minutesorlessand
survival benefit when arriving within 90 minutes and within
120 minutes. A recent comprehensive and systematic review
of the medical literature on the effect of prehospital time on
the outcome of trauma patients also found a benefit of rapid

Comprehensive mortality studies of the Afghanistan and
Iraq conflicts by Eastridge et al3,7 reported that 91% of all po-
tentially survivable deaths are related to hemorrhage and 77%
are categorized as KIA, with the death occurring in the pre-
hospital period before reaching a location capable of perform-
ing surgery. The KIA rate is a potential measure of weapon le-
thality, effectiveness of prehospital care, and availability of
prehospital transport.29 In our study, as availability of prehos-
pital transport increased after the mandate, a decrease in KIA
mortality was seen in spite of a simultaneous increase in ISS.
The relatively large beneficial influence of blood transfusions
on KIA mortality seen in our study may be explained by the
fact that hemorrhage is the leading cause of potentially sur-
vivable combat trauma death. Increased availability of blood

transfusions on evacuation platforms and quicker evacua-
tion response allowed transfusions to be performed earlier en
route and in the hospital, possibly enabling casualties to sur-
vive longer, albeit at a potential cost of DOW mortality or sur-
vival with morbidity.
Limitations of our study include the use of historical con-
trols for pre-post comparisons and reliance on post hoc analy-
sis of nonrandomized data, primarily owing to variance in data
capture and collection that may have introduced bias; analy-
sis of blood transfusions, particularly MTs, which has been
known to contribute to survival bias; and use of ISS, which can
confound pre-post comparisons and may underestimate com-
plex battlefield wounds.39 Battlefield prehospital data have
proved challenging to collect, validate, and analyze for many
reasons, including lack of a mandate to collect such data and
lack of enforcement of prehospital documentation. Details for
prehospital field care and ground transport are unknown be-
cause these data were not comprehensively documented, col-
lected, or consolidated. Although protocols for prehospital
blood transfusion resulted in reliable documentation of this
practice, documentation of hemorrhage control (eg, tourni-
quets, hemostatic agents) and other prehospital interven-
tions was sporadic, and their potential confounding and de-
gree of influence on morbidity and mortality could not be
reliably measured.
Since only 37.3% of potential individual-level analysis ca-
sualties had both prehospital flight data and treatment facil-
ity data that could be matched and since the total casualty
population suggests underrepresentation for casualties in-
jured before the mandate, adjustment for ISS and whether the
injury time period was before or after the mandate had to be
performed to account for these differences. Coupled with the
fact that multiple variables contributing to outcomes were
changing simultaneously, only descriptive interpretation was
viable. A review of the published literature also lacked de-
tailed prehospital flight data and analysis from historical con-
flicts for guidance or comparison. Although inherently chal-
lenging, future efforts must emphasize capture of prehospital
data on the battlefield.
Despite limitations of our study, the data show that com-
pliance with the 2009 mandate resulted in shorter transport
times and enhancements to treatment capability that im-
proved outcomes and potentially saved 359 lives. Trauma-
related performance improvement must be derived from de-
taileddocumentation,registry-baseddataanalysis,andquality
metrics to establish benchmarks, decrease variance, prevent
adverse events, and inform and adapt evidence-based pre-
hospital practices and leadership decisions. To improve data
quality and quantity, the Department of Defense Joint Trauma
System recently improved and standardized prehospital docu-
mentation tools.40-42 As of May 2015, the Department of De-
fensestillhasnomandateforprehospitaldocumentation;how-
ever, the US forces commander in Afghanistan mandated
prehospital documentation in 2013, and commensurate reg-
istries were developed to consolidate data.
Prehospital data are crucial since the greatest opportu-
nity to prevent death from potentially survivable combat in-
jury can be realized through prehospital efforts.3,38 Future
analysis should consider the actual tactical combat condi-
tions of war to account for influences of weather, illumina-
tion,altitude,terrain,protectiveequipment,masscasualtysce-
narios, and enemy actions on prehospital efforts. As medical,
environmental, and tactical considerations dictate prehos-
pital practices and priority and mode of transport, a systems
approach is paramount for optimizing casualty outcomes. In-
tegrated trauma system practices and emergency medical ser-
vices should be tailored to each battlefield to accommodate ca-
sualty demands within each unique environment. Future
efforts should also include continuous review and transla-
tionofbestpracticesbetweennationsandthecivilianandmili-
tary sectors.
Time-related trauma outcome is inextricably linked to in-
jury severity and effective treatment capability. If treatment
is unavailable or ineffectively performed, then time, particu-
larly in the setting of critical injury, is independently less rel-
evant for optimizing outcomes. Casualty risk mitigation must
consider the balance between speed and availability of treat-
ment capability—rapid casualty transport to treatment, deliv-
ering treatment to the casualty, or both, as permitted by the
environment and enemy threat.
Conclusions

between critical injury and definitive care for combat casual-
ties in Afghanistan. Despite evidence of increased severity and
complexity of wounds from explosive devices, the combina-
tion of reduced prehospital transport time and increased treat-
ment capability are likely contributors of casualty survival.
