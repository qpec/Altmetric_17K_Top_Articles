Resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with activating
EGFR mutations generally involve development of acquired secondary or tertiary EGFR mutations, such as
T790M or C797S. However, case reports have demonstrated that actionable receptor tyrosine kinase fusions such
as EML4-ALK, CCDC6-RET, and FGFR3-TACC3 can potentially confer resistance to EGFR TKIs. We seeked to
identify the prevalence of FGFR3-TACC3 fusion transcripts as resistance mechanism to EGFR TKIs. Hybrid-
capture based genomic profiling was performed on FFPE tissue samples and circulating tumor DNA isolated from
peripheral whole blood in the course of clinical care. We performed a comprehensive survey of 17,319 clinical
NSCLC samples (14,170 adenocarcinomas and 3149 NSCLC not otherwise specified (NOS)) and identified 5 cases
of FGFR3-TACC3 containing the intact kinase domain of FGFR3 and the coiled-coil domain of TACC3 emerging
after treatment with EGFR TKIs, including one previously reported index case. Of the 4 novel cases of FGFR3-
TACC3, one emerged after erlotinib, one after afatinib, one after osimertinib, and one after ASP8273. These 5
cases of FGFR3-TACC3 fusions acquired post-EGFR TKI, while rare, indicate that FGFR3-TACC3 is a recurrent
resistance mechanism, which can bypass EGFR blockade by all generations of EGFR TKIs in NSCLC. Routine re-
biopsy and genomic profiling using platforms capable of detecting kinase fusions has the potential to inform new
therapeutic strategies for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC progressing on TKIs.
1. Introduction
The majority of reported acquired resistance mechanisms to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) generally involve mutations in the
kinase domain which alter drug binding and/or ATP affinity, including
T790M, which mediates resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR
TKIs [1,2], and C797S, which mediates resistance to the third-genera-
tion EGFR TKI such as osimertinib [3,4]. MET amplification is another
recognized resistance mechanism to all generations of EGFR TKIs. Other
common resistance mechanisms include bypass pathway activation, via
mechanisms such as MET amplification, and small cell transformation,
both of which have been observed as resistance mechanism to all
generations of EGFR TKIs [1,2,5,6]. Recently, reports have identified
known oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) fusions (CCDC6-RET,
FGFR3-TACC3, EML4-ALK) emerging after disease progression on EGFR
TKIs [7–9]. Hence we performed a survey of the genomic database of
Foundation Medicine, Inc for cases with FGFR3-TACC3 fusions that also
had co-existing activating EGFR mutations.

 2. Materials and methods
Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on tissue samples
using the FoundationOne® assay as previously described [10]. Briefly,
DNA was extracted from 40 μM of FFPE sections (generally 10 un-
stained 4 μM slides), and CGP (Comprehensive Genomic Profiling) was
performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation based libraries
to a mean coverage depth of > 550X for 236 or 315 cancer-related
genes plus select introns from 19 or 28 genes frequently rearranged in
cancer. Genomic profiling of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using the
assay FoundationACT™ assay was performed as described previously
[11] where two 10 mL aliquots of peripheral, whole blood were col-
lected in proprietary, stabilizing collection tubes. A double spin pro-
tocol was used to isolate plasma and 50–100 ng of ctDNA was extracted
to create adapted sequencing libraries prior to hybrid capture and
sample-multiplexed sequencing on an Illumina HSQ2500. This ctDNA
test covers 62 genes to > 3000× unique coverage and employs pro-
priety algorithms to call alterations at low allele frequencies (0.1% for
substitutions, 1% for indels and rearrangements, and 20% for copy-
number amplifications). Mutant allele frequency (MAF) for the tissue-
based assay represents the percentage of DNA obtained from the
biopsied tumor which contains the mutation. In the blood, MAF re-
presents the percentage of ctDNA in the blood stream harboring the
mutation on the given day and time of specimen procurement. MAF for
the tissue assay and ctDNA assays cannot be directly compared. Both
assays are validated and performed on similar Clinical Laboratory Im-
provement Amendments (CLIA)-certified genomic profiling platforms
(Foundation Medicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA). Approval for this study,
including a waiver of informed consent and a HIPAA waiver of au-
thorization, was obtained from the Western Institutional Review Board
(Protocol No. 20152817).
3. Results
We surveyed 17,319 clinical lung cancer samples (14,170 adeno-
carcinomas and 3149 NSCLC not otherwise specified (NOS)) submitted
between August 2012 and March 2017. We identified a total of 5 cases
of FGFR3-TACC3 fusions and activating EGFR mutations in the setting
of known resistance to EGFR TKIs. No co-occurring FGFR3 fusions and
EGFR activating mutations were identified in 2609 cases of lung
squamous cell carcinoma. One of the five cases has been reported [8],
and here we report the 4 additional cases identified. All fusions in-
volved the complete FGFR3 kinase domain and were predicted to be in
frame.
Case 1. Patient is a 49-old Asian female never-smoker who pre-
sented with stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung. Her tumor was sub-
mitted for CGP, which revealed only EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del),
TP53 Y163C, and RB1 loss (Table 1). She received afatinib and
achieved a partial response (PR) by RECIST for 16 months in the pri-
mary tumor before appearance of new metastatic nodules (Fig. 1) and
eventual progression of her primary tumor. Because of the location and
size of the primary tumor and pulmonary nodules (Fig. 1A), a plasma-
based circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay was performed as pre-
viously described [10] and revealed the original EGFR ex19del as well
as an acquired FGFR3-TACC3 fusion (F18; T10) (Fig. 1B). Details of the
detected genomic changes pre- and post-EGFR TKI are listed in Table 1.

Case 2. Patient was a 45-year-old male with EGFR ex19del positive
stage IV NSCLC who achieved a PR on erlotinib for 8 months. On
progression, CGP revealed the original EGFR ex19del and EGFR T790M
resistance mutation. The patient was treated on a clinical trial with a
third-generation EGFR TKI, ASP8273. After achieving a PR for another

 8 months, the patient’s disease again progressed and repeat tumor
biopsy was performed. CGP of this sample revealed loss of EGFR T790M
mutation, but the emergence of FGFR3-TACC3 (F18; T7) (Fig. 1B) and
retention of the original activating EGFR ex19del mutation. Patient
received palliative radiation and received osimertinib but passed away
2 months after discontinuation of ASP8273.
Case 3. Patient was a 66-year-old female diagnosed with NSCLC
positive for EGFR ex19del mutation identified by local testing. She was
treated with erlotinib and achieved a PR (> 80% tumor shrinkage) for
11 months prior to disease progression. She then received 4 cycles of
paclitaxel/carboplatin/bevacizumab followed by maintenance erlotinib
with bevacizumab for 7 cycles. Upon subsequent disease progression

 she received 7 cycles of afatinib with cetuximab and whole brain ra-
diation therapy for asymptomatic brain metastasis. At this time, CGP of
a lung tumor biopsied at progression revealed FGFR3 amplification and
FGFR3-TACC3 (F17; T11) (Fig. 1B) as well as the primary EGFR ex19del
mutation. The patient received gemcitabine and vinorelbine and then
docetaxel with some clinical benefit.
Case 4. Patient is a 74-year-old male diagnosed with lung adeno-
carcinoma positive for EGFR ex19del by local testing. He was treated
with erlotinib with a PR; however, after 5 months of therapy he de-
veloped pneumonitis and therapy was discontinued. Post-erlotinib, a
blood sample was sent for analysis using a plasma-based ctDNA assay,
which revealed EGFR T790M mutation in addition to the EGFR ex19del.
Osimertinib was begun and the patient had a PR lasting for approxi-
mately 4 months, when he presented with increasing symptoms and
worsening disease on imaging. Upon progression on osimertinb a
second blood sample was sent for ctDNA testing, and the T790M mu-
tation was not detected; however, an FGFR3-TACC3 (F18; T13) fusion
(Fig. 1B) and retention of the original EGFR ex19del mutation was
observed. Subsequently, the patient received one dose of paclitaxel, but
was hospitalized for symptom management and has now received two
doses of nivolumab.
4. Discussion
In addition to the first case report of an FGFR3-TACC3 fusion as
potential resistance mechanism to EGFR TKI [8], herein, we report four
additional cases of EGFR-mutated NSCLC with FGFR3-TACC3 fusions
acquired post EGFR targeted therapy, implicating FGFR3-TACC3 fusion
as a rare but recurrent mechanism of acquired resistance to all three
generations of EGFR TKIs (erlotinib, afatinib, osimeritnib, ASP8273). In
each case, the acquired fusion occurred in the absence of other known
mechanisms of resistance, and in 3 of 4 cases a prior sample was as-
sayed on the same or similar platform and was negative for any FGFR
alterations including kinase fusion. In this series, each FGFR3-TACC3
fusion results in C-terminal truncation of FGFR3 (breakpoint in intron
17 or exon 18) with a retained kinase domain, fused to TACC3
(breakpoints ranging between intron 6 and exon 13), which retains its
coiled-coil dimerization domain (Fig. 1B). In two cases presented in this
series T790M was no longer detected post-osimertinib progression and
instead the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion emerged as a potential resistance
mechanism. FGFR3-TACC3 fusions have been reported in both squa-
mous cell carcinoma [12,13] and adenocarcinoma of the lung [13,14].
Notably, the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion transcript was shown to activate Erk
signaling to escape EGFR/ERBB3 blockade in a head and neck squa-
mous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) xenograft model. Daly and colleagues
demonstrated during combination antibody blockade of EGFR and
ERBB3 in the HNSCC xenograft model that EGFR blockade pre-
ferentially inhibited Erk activation while ERBB3 blockade inhibited
AKT activation. Upon progression of the xenograft, there was emer-
gence of the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion transcripts detected. Furthermore,
introduction of FGFR3-TACC3 conferred resistance to osimertinib in-
hibition of the NCI-H1975 (EGFR L858R + T790M) cell line, but did
not confer resistance to PI3K inhibition of PI3K mutated cell lines [15].
The observation that RTK fusions especially FGFR3-TACC3 can
emerge as mechanisms of acquired resistance to all current generations
of EGFR TKIs in EGFR-driven NSCLC is relatively new. For patients with
FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive disease, there are no approved US FDA
approved TKIs targeting FGFR, thus severely limiting options of com-
bining FGFR inhibitors and EGFR TKIs. Although patient in case 1 re-
sponded to chemotherapy, given the multiple individual cases of ac-
quired resistance presented herein, as well as the potentially prominent
role of FGFR3-TACC3 fusions as driver alterations in a diverse group of
malignancies, and the recent in vitro experiments suggesting that
FGFR3-TACC3 can activate bypass signaling to circumvent EGFR
blockade, development and approval of either pan-FGFR or specific
FGFR3 inhibitors is urgently needed. This reports highlights the im-
portant role of analysis of repeat biopsies and ctDNA using well vali-
dated methods capable of sensitive detection of all classes of genomic
alterations, including kinase fusions, to identify rare mechanisms of
acquired resistance and guide future therapy selection.
