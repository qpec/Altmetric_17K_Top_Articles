Background
Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established
cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy
could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people
with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.
Objectives
To determine if ’lower’ blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared
with ’standard’ blood pressure targets (≤ 140 to 160/ 90 to 100 mmHg) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of
cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).
Search methods
The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to February
2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE
(from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTri-
als.gov. We also searched the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature Database (from 1982) and contacted authors
of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. There were no language restrictions.
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group and at least six months follow-up. Trial
reports needed to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events,
cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions were lower target for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (≤ 135/85 mmHg) compared
with standard target for blood pressure (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg).
Participants were adults with documented hypertension or who were receiving treatment for hypertension and cardiovascular history
for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease or angina pectoris.

 Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by
The Cochrane Collaboration.
Main results
We included six RCTs that involved a total of 9795 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Five RCTs
provided individual patient data for 6775 participants.
We found no change in total mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.21;
moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, no differences were found in serious adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11; low-quality
evidence). There was a reduction in fatal and non fatal cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death,
hospitalization or death from congestive heart failure) with the lower target (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98; ARR 1.6% over 3.7 years;
low-quality evidence). There were more participant withdrawals due to adverse effects in the lower target arm (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06
to 32.28; very low-quality evidence). Blood pressures were lower in the lower’ target group by 9.5/4.9 mmHg. More drugs were needed
in the lower target group but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group.
Authors’ conclusions
No evidence of a difference in total mortality and serious adverse events was found between treating to a lower or to a standard blood
pressure target in people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease. This suggests no net health benefit from a lower systolic blood
pressure target despite the small absolute reduction in total cardiovascular serious adverse events. There was very limited evidence on
adverse events, which lead to high uncertainty. At present there is insufficient evidence to justify lower blood pressure targets (≤ 135/
85 mmHg) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. More trials are needed to answer this question.

Blood pressure targets in people with cardiovascular disease
Review question
We assessed whether lower blood pressure goals are better than standard blood pressure goals for people with high blood pressure who
also have heart or vascular problems.
Background
Many people with heart or vascular problems also have high blood pressure. Some clinical guidelines recommend a lower blood pressure
goal (135/85 mmHg or lower) in people with previous heart or vascular problems compared with those without (≤140 to 160 mmHg
systolic and ≤ 90 to 100 mmHg diastolic are standard blood pressure goals). It is unclear if the lower goals lead to overall health benefits.
Search date
We searched for evidence up to February 2017.
Study characteristics
We included six trials with 9795 participants who were followed-up for between a year and 4.7 years. We analyzed data to detect
differences between lower and standard blood pressure goals on numbers of deaths and serious adverse events (leading to hospital
admission).
Key results
We found no differences in total numbers of deaths, heart or vascular deaths or serious harms between lower and standard blood
pressure goal approaches. Based on very little information, we found more dropouts due to drug-related harms in the lower blood
pressure target group. The only significant benefit among people in the lower group in the studies analyzed was a slight decrease in
total heart or vascular problems, but there was no overall health benefit.

 The best available evidence does not support lower blood pressure goals over standard goals in people with elevated blood pressure
and heart or vascular problems. More new trials are needed to answer this question. Overall, quality evidence was assessed as low to
moderate according to the GRADE assessment.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect
Moderate quality: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is
substantially different
Low quality: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect
Very low quality: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect
1 Downgraded one level due to serious imprecision (95% CI is wider than the minimal important difference).
2 Downgraded one level due to incomplete available data.
3 Downgraded one level due to high risk of bias.
4 Downgraded two levels because only two of the smaller studies reported this outcome.

Description of the condition
Hypertension (high blood pressure) is one of the most preventable
causes of premature morbidity and mortality worldwide. It was
described as the second leading risk factor for the global burden of
disease in 2013 (Forouzanfar 2015). Hypertension is a major risk
factor for ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarc-
tion, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, peripheral vascular dis-
ease (PVD), cognitive decline and premature death (NICE 2016).
Historically more emphasis was placed on diastolic than on sys-
tolic blood pressure as a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and
fatal events. However a large number of observational studies have
demonstrated both systolic and diastolic blood pressures show a
graded independent relationship with mortality and morbidity
(ESH-ESC 2013). Untreated hypertension may be associated with
a progressive rise in blood pressure, possibly culminating in a treat-
ment-resistant state due to associated vascular and kidney damage
(NICE 2016).
Epidemiological studies suggest that the risk associated with blood
pressure is a continuous relationship and for blood pressures above
115/70 mmHg, the risk of cardiovascular events doubles for every
20/10 mmHg rise in blood pressure. This suggests that for every 20
mmHg lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) or 10 mmHg diastolic
blood pressure (DBP), the risk of a cardiovascular event is reduced
by about 50% (Lewington 2002).
Blood pressure is normally distributed in a population and there is
no natural cut-off point above which hypertension definitively ex-
ists and below which it does not. In any individual person, systolic
and/or diastolic blood pressures maybe elevated. Diastolic pres-
sure is more commonly elevated in people younger than 50. With
ageing,systolic hypertension becomes a more significant problem,
as a result of progressive stiffening and loss of compliance of larger
arteries. (NICE 2016).
Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death around
the world (Townsend 2016). Cardiovascular disease accounts for
more than all communicable, neonatal, maternal and nutritional
disorders combined, and double the number of deaths caused
by cancers. Globally, cardiovascular disease accounts for approx-
imately 17 million deaths annually, nearly one third of the total
number of deaths. Of these, complications of hypertension ac-
count for 9.4 million deaths worldwide every year. Despite of that,
between 1990 and 2013 age-standardized death rates fell by 22%
for cardiovascular and circulatory diseases, mainly due to trends in
high- and middle-income countries (GBD 2013). Ischaemic heart
disease (IHD) and cerebrovascular diseases are both considered to
be major cardiovascular diseases, resulting in 130 million disabil-
ity-adjusted life years lost in 2010 (WHO 2010).
Thus, cardiovascular secondary prevention is considered to be a
key issue. People who have had atherosclerotic stroke should be in-
cluded among those deemed to be at high risk (20% over 10 years)
of further atherosclerotic coronary events. A significant percent-
age of those who have a first myocardial infarction are expected to
experience recurrent myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke or
fatal coronary heart disease (CHD). In fact, within five years of a
first myocardial infarction around 20% to 30% of the population
aged over 65 years will experience recurrent myocardial infarction
or fatal CHD (Mozaffarian 2015).
Description of the intervention
Target blood pressures are used in clinical practice by clinicians to
make treatment decisions related to the intensity of antihyperten-
sive therapy for each patient.
The standard blood pressure target has generally been an arbitrary
threshold blood pressure above which treatment is recommended.
Over time the threshold has become lower. The standard systolic
blood pressure target declined from a target of ≤ 160 mmHg to
a target of ≤ 140 mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure target
has decreased from ≤100 mmHg to ≤ 90 mmHg in people aged
up to 80 years (ESH-ESC 2007; NICE 2016). Even lower blood
pressure targets have been proposed for people with history of
cardiovascular events (AHA 2007; ESH-ESC 2007; JNC-7 2003).
Recently, a review of the available evidence has led to a re-appraisal
of some recommendations made by international guidelines, par-
ticularly among older people , those with diabetes or previous
cardiovascular disease (ESH-ESC 2013; JNC-8 2014; Joint ESC
2016).
How the intervention might work
Some evidence suggests that in people at high risk thresholds for
antihypertensive treatment should be lower than for those at lower
risk. It has also been suggested that to maximize the cost-effective-
ness of hypertension management, the intensity of the therapeutic
approach should be graded as a function of total cardiovascular
risk (ESH-ESC 2007). However, there is a trend to homogenize
blood pressure goals. For example, the European guidelines on
hypertension recommend < 140/90 mmHg in most clinical situ-
ations (ESH-ESC 2013).
People with a history of cardiovascular disease are considered to be
in a high-risk population. The effect of lowering the blood pressure
values in these people could have a greater absolute reduction
of morbidity and mortality but could also be associated with an
absolute increase in adverse events.
Reducing blood pressure below standard targets using drug ther-
apy has been recommended in guidelines as a strategy for those
with history of cardiovascular disease. Nevertheless,lower may not
always be better. A J-curve has been described for blood pressure in
coronary artery disease (Bangalore 2010; Messerli 2006). In peo-
ple with coronary artery disease low blood pressure (< 110 to 120/

 60 to 70 mmHg) was associated with an increased risk of future
cardiovascular events (Bangalore 2010).
A recent cohort study (Vidal-Petiot 2016) explored the associa-
tion between achieved blood pressure and cardiovascular events
in people with hypertension and history of coronary disease. The
study concluded that in participants where < 120/70 mmHg was
reached, an association with more cardiovascular adverse events
was detected, supporting the J-curve hypothesis (Vidal-Petiot
2016).
Uncertainty remains on many aspects of this controversial topic
leading to differing opinions (Mancia 2014; Verdecchia 2014).
Why it is important to do this review
The arterial pressure threshold above which the benefits of treat-
ment outweigh the harms in people with hypertension and car-
diovascular disease is unclear.
Blood pressure targets lower than standard targets have been rec-
ommended in some, but not all, clinical guidelines. The following
are the recommendations for blood pressure targets in people with
hypertension and cardiovascular disease from various guidelines
published recently.
The Joint National Committee-7 Report (JNC-7 2003) recom-
mended blood pressure targets < 140/90 mmHg for people with
uncomplicated hypertension. In people with hypertension and ei-
ther diabetes or kidney disease the recommended blood pressure
target was < 130/80 mmHg. However, the statement was updated
in 2014 and made some changes to the goals policy (JNC-8 2014).
According to JNC-8 2014, in the general population aged 60 years
it is suggested to treat to goals of SBP < 150 mmHg and DBP
< 90 mmHg. In the general population aged up to 60 years, the
guideline maintains the recommendation of treating to goals of
SBP < 140 mmHg and DBP < 90 mmHg. In people with dia-
betes or kidney disease, new targets are similar to those for general
population. No direct recommendation was made for those with
previous cardiovascular disease, although it is acknowledged as a
relevant question to be assessed and answered (JNC-8 2014).
The 2007 European Society of Hypertension and European So-
ciety of Cardiovascular guidelines for the management of arterial
hypertension (ESH-ESC 2007) recommended that blood pressure
should be reduced to < 140/90 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) and to
lower values, if tolerated, in all people with hypertension. The
blood pressure goal was < 130/80 mmHg in people with diabetes
and others at high risk, such as those with associated clinical con-
ditions (stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney dysfunction, pro-
teinuria). The reappraisal of European guidelines on hypertension
management (ESH 2009) remarks that the recommendation to
lower blood pressure ≤ 130/80 mmHg in people with diabetes or
a history of cardiovascular disease is not supported by incontro-
vertible trial evidence. The most recent update (ESH-ESC 2013)
proposed SBP goal < 140 mmHg for those at low to moderate car-
diovascular risk, diabetes, previous stroke, CHD or kidney disease.
In older people with hypertension, good evidence is considered
to recommend reducing SBP to between 150 and 140 mmHg,
regardless of age provided they are in good physical and mental
health. A DBP target of < 90 mmHg is always recommended,
except in those with diabetes, in whom values < 85 mmHg are
suggested.
The 2016 European Guidelines on cardiovascular disease preven-
tion in clinical practice (Joint ESC 2016) indicate there was suf-
ficient evidence to recommend a blood pressure target < 140/90
mmHg in all people who are hypertensive (except older people
in whom the benefit has not been tested in randomized trials).
According to the Joint ESC 2016, the recommendation to aim
for a lower systolic blood pressure goal < 130 mmHg in people
with diabetes and those at very high cardiovascular risk (previous
cardiovascular events) is not consistently supported by trial evi-
dence. Thus, it would be prudent to recommend lowering blood
pressure to values within the range 130 to 139/80 to 85 mmHg,
and possibly, closer to lower values in this range for all people with
hypertension.
In its Recommendations for Blood Pressure Measurement, Di-
agnosis, Assessment of Risk, Prevention, and Treatment of Hy-
pertension the 2015 Canadian Hypertension Education Program
(CHEP 2015) made a proposal to reach blood pressure targets
< 140/90 mmHg in most situations, including people with pre-
vious cardiovascular disease. Nevertheless, the last update of this
guideline (CHEP 2016) is prone to an intensive intervention in
some people with high cardiovascular risk, including those with
cardiovascular disease. Specifically, the guideline calls to consider
a < 120 mmHg target, taking into account the SPRINT results
(SPRINT 2015).
A Cochrane Reviewfoundthattreatinghypertension to lowerthan
standard blood pressure target ≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg
was not proven to reduce mortality or morbidity in the overall
population (Arguedas 2009). Another Cochrane Review analysing
the same question in people with diabetes found a reduction in
the incidence of stroke with the lower goal, but also significant
increase in the number of serious adverse events (Arguedas 2013).
Two non-Cochrane reviews have also been published on this is-
sue (Ettehad 2016; Xie 2016). Ettehad 2016 combined data from
all relevant clinical trials published on blood pressure reduction.
The effects of blood pressure decrease were estimated in terms of
mortality or cardiovascular morbidity and according to different
basal characteristics, such as established cardiovascular disease. A
decrease in mortality and other cardiovascular events was identi-
fied as blood pressure was reduced. The review found inconsistent
results on safety issues. Xie 2016 focused on the efficacy and safety
of blood pressure decrease intensive strategies, including clinical
trials with at least six months follow-up that randomized partic-
ipants to more intensive versus less intensive blood pressure tar-
gets, different blood pressure targets or different blood pressure
changes from baseline. Participants in the intensive group showed
a decreased risk in terms of less ictus and relevant cardiovascular

 events.
Several guidelines have been published that directly focus on the
main objective of this Cochrane Review - cardiovascular secondary
prevention. The 2007 guidelines for the Treatment of Hyperten-
sion in the Prevention and Management of Ischemic Heart Disease
from the American Heart Association (AHA 2007) recommended
blood pressure targets < 130/80 mmHg for people with demon-
strated coronary artery disease or risk equivalents (carotid artery
disease, peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm and
for high-risk people). Subsequently, when performance measures
were proposed based on these recommendations, limitations were
admitted due to the lack of clinical trials that directly compared
clinical outcomes of large populations of people with coronary
disease randomized to different blood pressure targets (Drozda
2011). This guideline was updated in 2015 (Rosendorff 2015).
The update concluded that < 140/90 mmHg would seem a reason-
able target for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events
in people with hypertension and coronary artery disease.
Conversely, with less support of evidence, a lower blood pressure
target(<130/80mmHg)couldbe appropriate in some people with
coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or
coronary artery disease equivalents (carotid artery disease, periph-
eral artery disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm).
There are limited data that specifically assess the optimal blood
pressure target in relation to secondary stroke prevention. The
American guidelines note that goals for target blood pressure level
or reduction from pretreatment baseline are uncertain and should
be individualized(Kernan 2014). Forpeople whohave hadarecent
lacunar stroke a systolic blood pressure of < 130 mmHg is accepted
as reasonable; for people who have had other types of stroke, <
140/90 mmHg is recommended.
There is also the potential that lowering blood pressure too much
may cause adverse cardiovascular events (Filippone 2011). Some
observations have suggested that excessive lowering of blood pres-
sure using drug treatment is associated with an increased number
of deaths due to coronary heart disease (Farnett 1991), particularly
in those with coronary artery disease (Bangalore 2010; Messerli
2006). Taking into account that controversy remains over a poten-
tial J-curve phenomenon (Mancia 2014; Verdecchia 2014), addi-
tional studies are expected to clarify the dilemma.
Therefore, at present the optimal blood pressure target to reduce
morbidity and mortality in people with hypertension and history
of cardiovascular disease is unknown. This Review aimed to estab-
lish if a more strict blood pressure target should be recommended
for these people.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than
50 participants per group and at least six months follow-up. We
also included a study if ≥ 70% of participants met this criterion,
or individual patient data were available, or data from relevant
participants were provided separately enabling specific inclusion of
this population as defined. Blinding was not possible. Trial reports
needed to present data for at least one primary outcome to be
eligible for inclusion.
We excluded trials that used anything other than accepted ran-
domized allocation methods such as alternate allocation, week of
presentation, or retrospective controls. There were no restrictions
on publication language.
Types of participants
Participants had to be at least 18 years of age with hypertension
documented in a standard way or to be receiving treatment for
hypertension, and with a positive cardiovascular history of my-
ocardial infarction, stroke (not including transient ischaemic at-
tack (TIA)), chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease or angina
pectoris.
Trials were not limited by any other factor or baseline risk.
Types of interventions
Intervention: lower blood pressure treatment target: systolic/dias-
tolic ≤ 135/85 mmHg; mean blood pressure ≤ 102 mmHg.
Control: standard blood pressure treatment target: systolic/dias-
tolic ≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg; mean blood pressure ≤ 107
to 120 mmHg.
Mean blood pressure (MBP) was also accepted as a valid way of
measuring interventions, taking into account the prespecified tar-
gets and according to the following equation: MBP = [(2 x dias-
tolic) + systolic] / 3.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
1. Total mortality.
8

 2. Total serious adverse events.
3. Total cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction,
stroke, sudden death, hospitalization or death from congestive
heart failure and other significant vascular events such as
ruptured aneurysms (excluding angina, transient ischaemic
attack, surgical or other procedures or accelerated hypertension).
In practice it was measured as total number of participants with
at least one cardiovascular event, including fatal and non fatal
cardiovascular events.
4. Cardiovascular mortality.
We defined serious adverse events according to the International
Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines (ICH 1995) as any
event that leads to death, that was life threatening, required in-
patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,
resulted in persistent or significant disability, or was a congenital
anomaly or birth defect.
If a study used a different definition for serious adverse events,
the inclusion of data was resolved by consensus among the review
authors.
All four primary outcomes were included in ’Summary of findings’
tables.
Secondary outcomes
1. Participant withdrawals due to adverse effects.
2. Systolic blood pressure and the difference from baseline at
one year, or both.
3. Diastolic blood pressure and the difference from baseline at
one year, or both.
4. Proportion of participants reaching the target blood
pressure level.
5. Number of antihypertensive drugs that each participant
needed at the end of the study.
Participant withdrawals due to adverse effects was considered to be
an important outcome and was included in ’Summary of findings’
tables.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist conducted
systematic searches in the following databases for randomised con-
trolled trials without language, publication year or publication sta-
tus restrictions:
• the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register via the
Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS-Web) (searched 5 February
2017);
• the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS-Web)
(searched 5 February 2017);
• MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946 onwards), MEDLINE Ovid
Epub Ahead of Print, and MEDLINE Ovid In-Process & Other
Non-Indexed Citations (searched 5 February 2017);
• Embase Ovid (searched 5 February 2017);
• ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) searched 5
February 2017);
• World Health Organization International Clinical Trials
Registry Platform (www.who.int/trialsearch) searched 5 February
2017).
We also searched the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sci-
ence Literature Database Bireme (searched 2 March 2017).
The Information Specialist modelled subject strategies for
databases on the search strategy designed for MEDLINE. Where
appropriate, they were combined with subject strategy adaptations
of the highly sensitive search strategy designed by Cochrane for
identifying randomised controlled (as described in the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0,
Box 6.4.b. (Handbook 2011)). Search strategies for databases are
provided in Appendix 1. We did not apply a language restriction
to the database searches.
Searching other resources
• The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist
searched the Hypertension Specialised Register segment (which
includes searches of MEDLINE and Epistemonikos for
systematic reviews) to retrieve existing systematic reviews relevant
to this systematic review, so that we could scan their reference
lists for additional trials. The Specialised Register also includes
searches of CAB Abstracts & Global Health, CINAHL,
ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, and Web of Knowledge.
• We checked the bibliographies of included studies and any
relevant systematic reviews identified for further references to
relevant trials.
• Where necessary, we contacted authors of key papers and
abstracts to request additional information about their trials.
• We searched Trip Database (www.tripdatabase.com/),
updated to February 2017.
• We attempted to identify additional trials by searching the
reference lists of included trials and (systematic) reviews, meta-
analyses, and health technology assessment reports (Appendix 2).
Authors of trials reporting incomplete information were
contacted to provide the missing information.
Dealing with duplicate publications
Whenmore thanone publicationof an original trial wasidentified,
we assessed those articles together to maximise data collection.
In the case of substantial disagreements between articles, study
authors were contacted.

 References from published studies
We examined the references of included and excluded studies to
identify further references linked to potentially eligible RCTs.
Language
There were no language restrictions. Any study not published in
English, French or Spanish was translated.
Correspondence
We contacted trial investigators to request data from subgroups of
participants with cardiovascular disease, missing data or to clarify
study details.
Data collection and analysis
Search resultswere independentlyassessedbyreviewauthorswork-
ing in pairs. One review author (LCS) reviewed all results. We
used Early Review Organizing Software version 2.0 (www.eros-
systematic-review.org) for screening and classifying references.
Selection of studies
Two independent review authors carried out the selection of pa-
pers, excluding records when the title, keywords and abstract
showed that it was not a RCT, there were fewer than 50 partici-
pants per group, the follow-up was less than six months, no review
primary outcomes were addressed, participants did not match pre-
specified criteria, blood pressure targets were not the only inter-
vention or specific targets were different from those prespecified.
We obtained the full text of all remaining articles considered for
inclusion, which were excluded if inclusion criteria were not met.
We obtained the full text of papers that could not be assessed from
information in the abstract. We provisionally included studies that
were likely to include subgroups of participants that met our crite-
ria, and contacted study authors to request data for the subgroup.
Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by a third review
author if necessary. When an issue was considered to be a highly
significant point, a plenary discussion was scheduled.
We constructed a PRISMA flow diagram depicting the study se-
lection process (Figure 1).
Data extraction and management
Two review authors independently extracted data from included
trials using a previously prepared data extraction form, including
basic information, verification of study eligibility, assessment of
risk of bias, baseline study characteristics, results in outcomes and
subgroup analysis. Extracted data were cross-checked by another
review author.
Differences between review authors were resolved by discussion
and involvement of a third author, when necessary. We used
Review Manager 2014 for data analyses. Quantitative analyses of
outcomes were based on intention-to-treat principle.
We used Microsoft Access and Microsoft Excel for organizing and
analyzing individual patient data.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each
study using the six domains of the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool,
according to the method described in the Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). Any difference
in opinion was resolved by discussion among all review authors.
We tried to find study protocols for comparison with published
study reports.
Review authors reported the overall risk of bias for all included
studies according to the following:
• low risk of bias (plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the
results) if all criteria were met;
• unclear risk of bias (plausible bias that raises some doubt
about the results) if one or more criteria were assessed as unclear;
or
• high risk of bias (plausible bias that seriously weakens
confidence in the results) if one or more criteria were not met.
We performed sensitivity analyses excluding trials with high or
high and unclear risk of bias.
Measures of treatment effect
We used Review Manager 2014 for analyses. Quantitative analy-
ses of outcomes were based on intention-to-treat results. We used
risk ratio (RR) and a fixed-effect model, if appropriate, to com-
bine dichotomous outcomes across trials. We calculated absolute
risk reduction (ARR), or absolute risk increase (ARI) and num-
ber needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB)
or number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome
(NNTH) for total mortality, total serious adverse events and total
cardiovascular events. We estimated the 95% confidence intervals
(CI). Combined outcomes were recorded and analyzed as partici-
pants with at least one event in the outcome.
We combined data for the blood pressure reached and the dif-
ference from baseline using a weighted mean difference (WMD)
method. This combines a weight based on the number of partici-
pants in the trial and the within-study variance. If the trial did not
report the within-study variance for decrease in blood pressure,
the standard deviation (SD) was imputed from the average stan-
dard deviation from the other trials. This imputation is a limita-
tion and to overcome it, the 99% CI was reported instead of the
standard 95% CI reported for all other data. Sensitivity analyses
were carried out to assess the impact of changing the assumptions
made.

 Unit of analysis issues
The analysis of outcomes was based on the randomized partici-
pants, but if cluster-randomized trials were included, we planned
to conduct appropriate analysis. We have taken special care to
identify if data presented were the total number of events or the
total number of participants with a first event. We contacted study
authors for clarification when necessary.
We selected data for the longest follow-up of the trial.
Dealing with missing data
We contacted study authors to obtain additional information not
provided in published articles.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We used Chi² and I² statistics to test for heterogeneity of treatment
effect among trials. We consider a Chi² value P < 0.05 or I² value >
50% indicative of heterogeneity. We used a random-effects model
to test for statistical significance when significant heterogeneity
existed where ‘random’ distribution of intervention effects could
be justified.
We planned to investigate possible causes for data showing more
than moderate heterogeneity (I² > 60%). If sources of heterogene-
ity could not be identified, studies were excluded from meta-anal-
ysis.
Assessment of reporting biases
We planned to construct a funnel plot if 10 or more studies were
included in the meta-analysis to test for asymmetry.
Data synthesis
Tworeviewauthorsanalyzeddatausing RevMan (Review Manager
2014) and reported data in accordance with Cochrane Handbook
guidance (Higgins 2011). If meta-analysis was not appropriate,
we planned to provide a narrative description of the results.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
If possible, subgroup analysis were planned for:
1. Participants with diabetes.
2. Male and female participants.
3. People aged ≥ 75 years.
We aimed to investigate clinical heterogeneity by examining dif-
ferences in achieved blood pressure among trials, trial duration,
the different interventions for hypertension used and history of
stroke or coronary heart disease as inclusion criteria.
Sensitivity analysis
We tested the robustness of the results using several sensitivity
analysis including:
1. The risk of bias of the trials.
2. Trials which were industry sponsored versus non industry
sponsored.
We also tested the robustness of the results by repeating the analysis
using different measures of effects size (odds ratio) and different
statistical models.

Results of the search
The search identified 18,511 records. After removal of duplicates
and partial screening, 5810 records remained and were assessed
on the basis of title and abstract and 5639 records excluded. We
obtained the full text of 171 study reports; following exclusions,
13 reports remained. We contacted the authors of these 13 studies
for further information and subsequently excluded seven studies
based on information obtained.
We included six studies in the review that met inclusion criteria
(Figure 1).

 Included studies
We included six studies (AASK 2002; ACCORD BP 2010; HOT
1998; Past BP 2016; SPRINT 2015; SPS3 2013).
Four trials (SPS3 2013, and subgroups of participants with basal
cardiovascular disease in ACCORD BP 2010; Past BP 2016,
SPRINT 2015) compared two different systolic blood pressure
targets that met our inclusion criteria. One trial (HOT 1998)
compared two different diastolic blood pressure targets within our
criteria for lower and standard targets in a subgroup of participants
with secondary cardiovascular prevention. One trial (AASK 2002)
compared two mean blood pressure targets in a subgroup of par-
ticipants who met our predefined inclusion criteria. Comparative
basal characteristics of these six studies are described in Table 1.
Methods
All included trials were randomized and open with blinded end
point design. In AASK 2002, participants were also randomly
assigned (in a 3 x 2 factorial design) to either metoprolol, ramipril
or amlodipine treatment. In ACCORD BP 2010, participants
were also randomized to either intensive or standard glycaemic
control according to a 2 x 2 factorial design. HOT 1998 also used
a 3 x 2 factorial design and participants were also randomized to
receive either acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) or placebo. SPS3 2013
had a 2 x 2 factorial design with additional randomization to
aspirin + placebo or aspirin + clopidogrel.
The mean follow-up duration was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7
years).
Participants
The total number of participants included in the review was 9795
(lower target, 5456; standard target, 4339). AASK 2002 included
155 participants (14% of total AASK study); ACCORD BP 2010
included 1531 participants (32% of total ACCORD study); HOT
1998 included 3232 participants (17% of total HOT study); Past
BP 2016 included 295 participants (56% of total Past BP trial);
SPRINT 2015 included 1562 participants (17% of total SPRINT
study); and SPS3 2013 included 3020 participants (100% of total
SPS3 study).
AASK 2002 and SPRINT 2015 were conducted in the USA:
ACCORD BP 2010 in the USA and Canada: Past BP 2016 in the
UK; SPS3 2013 in eight countries in the Americas and Europe,
and HOT 1998 in over 20 countries in Asia, the Americas and
Europe.
Basal participant characteristics differed among trials (Table 1).
For participants’ basal cardiovascular condition, we accepted the
following participant profiles as valid secondary prevention:
• AASK 2002: participants with ischaemic heart disease
(IHD), stroke or peripheral vascular disease (PVD);
• ACCORD BP 2010: participants with myocardial
infarction, stroke or angina;
• HOT 1998: participants with myocardial infarction, stroke
or angina;
• Past BP 2016: included participants who had stroke or, less
frequently, IHD;
• SPRINT 2015: all included participants had IHD or PVD;
• SPS3 2013: some participants had IHD but all had recent
lacunar stroke.
Myocardial infarction and angina identified by electrocardiogram
(ECG) or coronary revascularization, and silent events, were con-
sidered to meet the inclusion criteria. In general, stroke was the
prevalent condition in AASK 2002, Past BP 2016 and SPS3 2013,
whereas ischaemic heart attack was the most prevalent condition
in ACCORD BP 2010, HOT 1998 and SPRINT 2015.
AASK 2002 and SPRINT 2015 excluded people with history of
diabetes, but HOT 1998, Past BP 2016 and SPS3 2013 included
some people with diabetes; all ACCORD BP 2010 participants
had this cardiovascular risk factor.
All studies included more men than women with a mean age from
57 to 71 years.
Ethnicity varied from all or mostly Caucasian (HOT 1998; Past
BP 2016), to mixed populations (ACCORD BP 2010, SPRINT
2015, SPS3 2013) and Afro-American participants (AASK 2002).
Trials included participants with reduced kidney function (AASK
2002), additional cardiovascular risk factors (ACCORD BP 2010;
SPRINT 2015), previous stroke (Past BP 2016; SPS3 2013) or
people who were generally hypertensive (HOT 1998).
The baseline blood pressure required for inclusion also varied.
AASK 2002 and HOT 1998 required diastolic blood pressure
(DBP) ≥ 95 mmHg or DBP 100 to 115 mmHg respectively,
whereas ACCORD BP 2010 and SPRINT 2015 required systolic
blood pressure (SBP) 130 to 180 mmHg, Past BP 2016 sought
SBP 125 mmHg and most SPS3 2013 participants (75%) had
SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg.
HOT 1998 was fully industry funded and AASK 2002 was
partially industry funded. ACCORD BP 2010, Past BP 2016,
SPRINT 2015 and SPS3 2013 were fully publicly funded.
ACCORD BP 2010, SPRINT 2015 and SPS3 2013 were sup-
ported by the National Institutes of Health in the USA. Past BP
2016 was funded by the National Institute for Health Research
(NIHR) in the UK.
Interventions
Participants in AASK 2002 were randomized to MBP 102 to 107
mmHg (standard target) or MBP < 92 mmHg (lower target).
13
Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease (Review)

 ACCORD BP 2010 and SPRINT 2015 randomized participants
to SBP < 140 mmHg (standard target) or SBP < 120 mmHg
(lower target). The participants in Past BP 2016 were randomized
to SBP < 140 mmHg (standard target) or < 130 mmHg (lower
target). Participants in SPS3 2013 were randomized to SBP 130 to
149 mmHg (standard target) or SBP < 130 mmHg (lower target).
Participants in HOT 1998 were randomized to DBP ≤ 90 mmHg
(standard target) or to DBP ≤ 85 mmHg or ≤ 80 mmHg (lower
target).
In AASK 2002, if the blood pressure goal could not be achieved by
the drug initially randomized (metoprolol, ramipril or amlodip-
ine), additional open-labelled antihypertensives (furosemide, dox-
azosin, clonidine, hydralazine or minoxidil) were added sequen-
tially. Felodipine was proposed as basal therapy in HOT 1998,
adding other drugs following a five-step regimen. In SPRINT
2015, the protocol encouraged the use of drug classes with the
strongest evidence for reduction in cardiovascular outcomes, in-
cluding thiazide-type diuretics (chlorthalidone encouraged as the
first-line agent), loop diuretics (for participants with advanced
chronic kidney disease), and beta-adrenergic blockers (for those
with coronary artery disease). No specific drug instructions were
provided in ACCORD BP 2010, Past BP 2016 or SPS3 2013.
Outcomes
The primary analysis in AASK 2002 focused on change in
glomerular filtration rate, measuring relevant cardiovascular events
as secondary outcomes. In ACCORD BP 2010, HOT 1998 and
SPRINT 2015 the main outcome was the occurrence of several
types of cardiovascular events. The primary outcome in Past BP
2016 was change in systolic blood pressure between baseline and
one year.Time to recurrent stroke was the main analysis in SPS3
2013.
Additional notes
AASK 2002 was conducted between February 1995 and Septem-
ber 2001; ACCORD BP 2010 was carried out between January
2001 and June 2009; HOT 1998 was conducted between Octo-
ber 1992 and August 1997; Past BP 2016 was carried out between
July 2008 and July 2012: SPRINT 2015 was conducted between
November 2010 and March 2013; SPS3 2013 was carried out be-
tween February 2003 and April 2012.
Excluded studies
We excluded twenty-nine records following assessment of full
text reports (Figure 1). Among them, it was considered useful to
provide a more detailed information about five excluded stud-
ies (MDRD 1994; NCT01230216; PODCAST 2013; REIN-2
2005; RESTART-AP 2013).
MDRD 1994 mainly focused on the effects of dietary protein re-
striction and blood pressure control on the progression of chronic
kidney disease. Individual patient data were provided by the
National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases
(NIDDK, USA). However, after a first analysis this study was ex-
cluded because there were fewer than 50 participants per group (an
inclusion criterion) (lower target (N = 56), 8 total deaths; standard
target (N = 47), 3 total deaths).
NCT01230216 was designed to assess whether an intensive blood
pressure target could reduce the percent of atheroma volume mea-
sured by intravascular ultrasound in hypertensive patients with
coronary artery disease. The study has been terminated early due
to slow patients enrolment.
The primary outcome for PODCAST 2013 was Addenbrooke’s
Cognitive Examination. Secondary outcomes included vascular
events, quality of life, functional outcome, depression and death.
The trial recruited 83 participants in the pilot phase . Low recruit-
ment meant the trial did not proceed, and did not meet the 50
participants per arm inclusion criterion for this review.
REIN-2 2005 was designed to establish whether further blood
pressure lowering therapy in addition to angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) could benefit people with chronic kid-
ney disease. Accordingly, the primary objective assessed the effect
of intensified versus conventional blood pressure control on pro-
gression to end-stage kidney disease. Individual patient data were
provided by the Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri
(Bergamo, Italy). It was confirmed there were fewer than 50 par-
ticipants per arm, so this study did not meet this inclusion crite-
rion. (Lower target (N = 34), 2 deaths; standard target (N = 39),
2 deaths).
RESTART-AP 2013 was designed to determine whether restart-
ing antithrombotic agents had an impact on the number of new
onset cerebral microbleeds and if intensive blood pressure low-
ering reduced their numbers. The study authors confirmed that
insufficient funding was available, and the study was terminated
early.
Studies awaiting classification
Three studies await classification (ABCD-H 1998; BBB 1994;
Cardio-Sis 2014). These studies did not report data for partici-
pants with cardiovascular disease at baseline. We have requested
these data from study authors, but had not received data before
publication of this review.
Ongoing studies
We
identified
six
ongoing
studies
(ESH-CHL-SHOT
2014; HOSP 2006; INFINITY 2013; ISRCTN37694103;
NCT01198496; NCT03015311). We will evaluate these studies
when complete for possible inclusion in future updates of this re-
view.

 Allocation
Except for SPRINT 2015, where no specific information on allo-
cationmethodwasprovided,all otherincludedstudies used a com-
puterized system for randomization. Methods for allocation were
judged as low risk of bias for five studies (AASK 2002; ACCORD
BP 2010; HOT 1998; Past BP 2016; SPS3 2013). SPRINT 2015
was judged as unclear risk of bias.
Blinding
None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clin-
icians because of the need to titrate antihypertensives to reach a
specific blood pressure goal. However, clinical events were assessed
by an independent committee blinded to the group allocation in
all trials. Hence, all trials were assessed at low risk of performance
and detection bias.
Incomplete outcome data
The available information (both published and unpublished) for
four trials (AASK 2002; ACCORD BP 2010; Past BP 2016;
SPRINT 2015) did not suggest a significant imbalance between
arms for withdrawals or dropouts, and were assessed at low risk of
attrition bias.
In HOT 1998 14% of total ECG could not be obtained, leading
to some uncertainty on silent myocardial infarctions. We decided
to assume a conservative perspective and consider unclear risk of
bias for this trial.
There was no information about how many participants lost to
follow-up were allocated to standard or lower blood pressure target
groups in SPS3 2013, which was assessed at unclear risk of attrition
bias.
Selective reporting
Protocols and published articles were assessed for AASK 2002,
ACCORD BP 2010, HOT 1998, Past BP 2016 and SPRINT
2015 with no sign of reporting bias confirmed. These trials were
assessed at low risk of reporting bias.
Serious adverse effects reporting in SPS3 2013 related to hypoten-
sion and blood pressure management only. We contacted study
authors for clarification but no response was received. This study
was assessed at high risk of selective reporting bias.
Other potential sources of bias
With the exception of SPS3 2013, all data used in this Cochrane
Review came from subgroups of participants not predefined in the
original study protocols and this constitutes a potential source of
bias.
Some studies were partially (AASK 2002) or fully (HOT 1998)
funded by pharmaceutical industry sources, which constitutes an-
other potential source of bias.
Earlyterminationof SPRINT 2015 wasalsoconsideredapotential
source of bias.

Lower versus standard blood pressure targets
We includedsixrandomizedcontrolledtrials(RCTs)(AASK 2002;
ACCORD BP 2010; HOT 1998; Past BP 2016; SPRINT 2015;
SPS3 2013) that met inclusion criteria. Data were obtained from
published and unpublished sources. We assumed that silent my-
ocardial infarction complied with the definition of cardiovascular
event when provided.
Primary outcomes

There was no difference in total mortality between lower and stan-
dard blood pressure target groups (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22,
P = 0.53; 6 studies; Analysis 1.1). When the absolute effect was
measured, three additional total deaths per 1000 participants were
identified in the lower target (95% CI 7 fewer to 15 more total
deaths per 1000 participants). There was a total of 373 deaths (of
5456 participants) in the lower target group and 294 (of 4339
participants) in the standard target group (Figure 3).

Serious adverse events
All included studies provided data for analysis of serious adverse
events. A broad definition of serious adverse event was adopted,
according to the ICH 1995 definition. We included in participants
with any cause of death, any cardiovascular event (as predefined
in our protocol) or any other serious adverse event as defined
by trial authors, avoiding double-counting of participants. When
all data were pooled, there was no difference in serious adverse
eventsbetweenthe lowerandstandardbloodpressure targetgroups
(RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11, P = 0.48; Analysis 1.2). When
the absolute effect was measured, three additional serious adverse
events per 1000 participants were identified in the lower target
group (95% CI 9 fewer to 20 more serious adverse events per 1000
participants). There were 966 participants with at least one serious
adverse events (of 5456 participants) in the lower target group and
805 (of 4339 participants) in the standard target group (Figure 4).
SPRINT 2015 was considered to report the full range of serious
adverse events (Analysis 1.2.1) and five studies reported subsets of
events (AASK 2002; ACCORD BP 2010; HOT 1998; Past BP
2016; SPS3 2013; Analysis 1.2.2).

Cardiovascular events
Data from 27 participants in AASK 2002 were analyzed in rela-
tion to individual cardiovascular events for myocardial infarction,
stroke and heart failure hospitalization; data from seven further
participants were analyzed from a direct cardiovascular mortality
diagnosis.

 Five included studies provided data by means of well-defined cate-
gories. The total number of cardiovascular events was significantly
reduced in the lower blood pressure target group compared with
the standard group (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98, P = 0.02; 6
studies, Analysis 1.3). When the absolute effect was measured, 16
fewer cardiovascular events per 1000 participants were identified
in the lower blood pressure target group (95% CI 2 to 27 fewer
cardiovascular events per 1000 participants). There were 555 par-
ticipants with cardiovascular events (of 5456 participants) in the
lower target group and 535 (of 4339 participants) in the standard
target group (Figure 5).

Cardiovascular mortality
Some comments relating to AASK 2002 need to be made before
reporting analysis results. AASK 2002 researchers used two dif-
ferent documents to register causes of death (CARDIO˙REVW
Form #38 and CC˙DEATH Form #48). There was no complete
overlap between forms. After discussion, we considered there to be
valid cardiovascular mortality when the researcher answered ’yes’
to question 4 in Form #38: “Was there a cardiovascular death?”
This indicated 11 deaths. Data from Form #48 were also analyzed
case-by-case by two clinicians (a cardiologist and a general prac-
titioner) and two additional deaths were identified after a careful
validation process.
Five trialsprovideddatabymeansof well-definedcategories. There
was no difference in cardiovascular mortality between the lower
and standard blood pressure target groups (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77
to 1.21, P = 0.75; Analysis 1.4). There were 169 cardiovascular
deaths (among 5456 participants) in the lower target group and
137 (among 4339 participants) in the standard target group (

 Secondary outcomes
Withdrawals due to adverse effects
Four trials (AASK 2002; ACCORD BP 2010; SPRINT 2015;
SPS3 2013) did not provide any information about withdrawals
due to adverse effects in participant with basal cardiovascular dis-
ease.
Data were extracted from free text notes only in HOT 1998; Past
BP 2016 provided better quality data. Despite limited informa-
tion, a difference in withdrawals due to adverse effects was found
between the lower and standard blood pressure target groups (RR
8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28, P = 0.003; Analysis 1.5). There were
22 withdrawals due to adverse effects (among 420 participants) in
the lower target group and only two (among 270 participants) in
the standard target group.
Blood pressure target achieved at 1 year
There were 3391/5143 (66%) participants who reached the target
in the lower target group and 3042/4098 (74%) participants in the
standard target group (AASK 2002; ACCORD BP 2010; HOT
1998; Past BP 2016; SPRINT 2015; SPS3 2013). Therefore, more
people in the standard group achieved particular blood pressure
targets.
Systolic blood pressure change from baseline at end of 1 year
After the first year of therapy, the average systolic blood pressure
achieved was significantly lower in the lower blood pressure tar-
get group (MD -9.52 mmHg, 95% CI -4.93 mmHg to -14.11
mmHg, P < 0.0001; 6 trials; Analysis 1.7). Heterogeneity among
trials was high, so a random-effects model was preferred for this
analysis. The different targets and the specific basal characteristics
for each trial were considered the most likely causes for this het-
erogeneity.
Diastolic blood pressure change from baseline at end of 1
year
After the first year of therapy, the average diastolic blood pressure
achieved was significantly lower in the lower blood pressure target
group (MD -4.93 mmHg, 95% CI -2.61 mmHg to -7.26 mmHg,
P < 0.0001; 5 trials; Analysis 1.8). Heterogeneity between trials
for this outcome was high, so a random-effects model was chosen
for this analysis. The different targets and the specific basal char-
acteristics for each trial were considered the most likely causes for
this heterogeneity.
Number of antihypertensive drugs needed at the end of
study
At the end of study, the number of antihypertensive drugs needed
was significantly lower in the standard blood pressure target group
(average 1.9 drugs) than the lower blood pressure target group
(average 2.4 drugs) (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.95, P = 0.006; 5
trials; Analysis 1.9). Heterogeneity between trials for this outcome
was high, so a random-effects model was chosen for this analysis.
The different targets and the specific basal characteristics for each
trial were considered the most likely causes for this heterogeneity.
D I S C U S S I O N
Pharmacological treatment of high blood pressure is aimed to re-
duce morbidity and mortality. Specific blood pressure targets have
been proposed in guidelines for people with hypertension who
have established cardiovascular disease, but optimal thresholds re-
main uncertain because the benefit to harm ratio of more intensive
treatment has not been established.
This Cochrane Review explored the current evidence from ran-
domized control trials (RCTs) and assessed relevant outcomes
linked to two alternative strategies: standard blood pressure target
(≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg) and lower blood pressure target
(≤ 135/85 mmHg).
We included six RCTs with a total of 9795 participants and a
mean follow-up of 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Four studies
compared systolic blood pressure targets, one compared diastolic
blood pressure targets and one compared mean blood pressure
targets. Individual patient data were available for five trials (AASK
2002; ACCORD BP 2010; HOT 1998; Past BP 2016; SPRINT
2015).
Two previous Cochrane Reviews adopted different strategies for
analysis. Arguedas 2009 pooled trial data for the main analysis, but
Arguedas 2013 considered each target (systolic or diastolic) sepa-
rately. Both approaches are suitable and relevant and our Cochrane
Protocol (Gorricho 2013) did not specify any particular strategy.
In this Cochrane Review we decided to use the pooled data as the
main analysis, but we also tested if results were consistent when
blood pressure targets were considered separately. To avoid mis-
classification problems, a third category (mean blood pressure) was
added to systolic/diastolic.
Summary of main results
Evidence from the six included trials indicated that blood pres-
sure targets were more frequently achieved in the standard blood
pressure target arm 3042/4098 (74%) than the lower target arm
3391/5143 (66%).
More antihypertensive drugs were used in the lower blood pressure
target group (average 2.4 drugs) than in the standard arm (average
1.9 drugs).

 There were broad differences for systolic (9.5 mmHg) and diastolic
(4.9 mmHg) blood pressure changes from baseline in the lower
arm.
No benefits in total mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22)
or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.21) were
detected. Subsequent analyses separating trials by systolic, dias-
tolic or mean blood pressure targets did not change these results.
A slight decrease was found with regard to fatal and non fatal car-
diovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sud-
den death, hospitalization or death from congestive heart failure)
(RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98) in favour of lower blood pres-
sure target, with no difference in total serious adverse events (RR
1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11). When systolic target trials were con-
sidered separately, a similar decrease in total cardiovascular events
was found in favour of the lower target but a lack of a difference
in total serious adverse events was also confirmed.
Most withdrawals due to adverse effects occurred in the lower
target arm (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28). However, little
evidence was available, making establishment of a trustworthy
global assessment of benefits and harms very challenging.
Importantly, no significant heterogeneity was detected for any pri-
mary outcome. Therefore, at present there does not seem to be
sufficient sound evidence to justify more strict blood pressure tar-
gets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) than the standard range (≤ 140 to 160/
90 to 100 mmHg) in people with hypertension and established
cardiovascular disease.
Significant heterogeneity was detected for two outcomes, blood
pressure difference from baseline at one year and number of hy-
pertensive drugs that each patient needed at the end of study.
The different targets and the specific basal characteristics for each
trial were considered the most likely causes for this heterogeneity.
Subgroup analysis indicated significant heterogeneity in the male
subgroup for cardiovascular mortality. The source of heterogene-
ity could be linked to a decrease in the number of participants
and events and differences in trial design between HOT 1998 and
ACCORD BP 2010/SPRINT 2015.
The minimum 5 mmHg difference in systolic or diastolic blood
pressure targets predefined as clinically significant in our protocol
agrees with previous guideline decisions (NICE 2016). Nonethe-
less, as Arguedas 2009 and Arguedas 2013 reported, it could be
argued that this difference is not large enough to detect signif-
icant changes in relevant outcomes. To test this hypothesis, an
additional sensitivity analysis was conducted in participants with
diabetes, excluding the intermediate < 85 mmHg target in HOT
1998 and the results were very similar between the main analysis in
participants with cardiovascular disease and the subgroup analysis
in participants with diabetes and high differences in targets (Table
2).
Four subgroup analyses were specified in our Cochrane Protocol
(people with diabetes, participant sex and people aged ≥ 75 years)
designed to explore potential differences in specific populations.
Despite the large amount of information retrieved from individual
patient data for this review, few data were available for people aged
≥ 75 years to draw any definite conclusion. When participant
data were split according to sex or only participants with diabetes
were considered, similar magnitudes of effect were found to those
describedinthe mainanalysis. People with diabetesandestablished
cardiovascular disease could be seen at first as being in a higher
risk category than people who do not have diabetes (Mancia
2011). However, estimates for people with diabetes were quite
similar to those in the general population with basal cardiovascular
disease: no differences in total mortality, cardiovascular mortality
or total cardiovascular events associated with lower target, and
no differences for both target strategies in serious adverse events.
There wasinsufficientevidence todetectgreatereffectfromalower
blood pressure target in these subgroups, although the sample sizes
were not large enough to exclude a significant effect.
Two sensitivity analyses were planned to test the robustness of the
results: risk of bias of the trials; and industry sponsored versus non
industry sponsored.
Because overall risk of bias was rated as high, sensitivity analysis
could not be performed. A slight difference was found in total
cardiovascular events in favour of the lower blood pressure target
in non industry sponsored trials (ACCORD BP 2010; Past BP
2016; SPRINT 2015; SPS3 2013), with no parallel better result
in serious adverse events.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Cardiovascular diseases are prevalent and high blood pressure is an
added risk factor commonly treated in this population. Evidence
based guidelines focused on this issue are needed. Unfortunately,
data from randomized controlled trials designed to clarify this
uncertainty remain insufficient.
This review included six trials but only one (SPS3 2013, 3020
participants) met the inclusion criteria as a whole study. The other
five studies contributed individual patient data for subgroups of
participants (AASK 2002, 155 participants; ACCORD BP 2010,
1531 participants; HOT 1998, 3232 participants, Past BP 2016,
295 participants; SPRINT 2015, 1562 participants).
Although this review analyzed a significant body of evidence, and
results are considered to be robust, results cannot be considered
as conclusive. Several ongoing trials (ESH-CHL-SHOT 2014;
ISRCTN37694103; NCT01198496) have been designed to ex-
plicitly answer relevant questions in people with established car-
diovascular disease; it is anticipated that these studies will yield
additional evidence.
Over 6000 participants provided data on systolic targets and
over 3000 on diastolic targets. Neither subanalysis substantially
changed overall results in primary outcomes when all target strate-
gies were considered together. From this perspective, the results
of this review can be generalized for physicians prescribing anti-
hypertensive drugs, no matter the specific target strategy (systolic,
21

 diastolic or both) chosen.
As identified by Arguedas 2009, and probably fuelled by the in-
tention-to-treat approach, this review did not find real differences
as wide as expected between arms in achieved systolic and diastolic
blood pressure, according to the predefined targets for each study.
The standard target was achieved in all six included trials but only
ACCORD BP 2010, Past BP 2016 and SPS3 2013 achieved the
required blood pressure in the lower target (in HOT 1998 the ≤
80 mmHg target was not achieved). This underlines the difficulty
of putting the intervention into practice, as often happens in real
life. Accordingly, this aspect could be seen as both a limitation or
a strength.
Quality of the evidence
We downgraded the quality of the evidence for total mortality and
cardiovascular mortality to moderate due to imprecision and lack
of data. In our opinion, other potential limitations (e.g. cardiovas-
cular disease subgroups were not predefined in several studies) are
unlikely to lower confidence in the estimate, taking into account
large sample sizes, the design of SPS3 2013 (31% of total partic-
ipants), the sensitivity analysis performed about potential risk of
bias, and the strength of the individual patient data analysis.
We also downgraded the quality of evidence for other outcomes:
total cardiovascular events and serious adverse events were as-
sessed as providing low-quality evidence; withdrawals due to ad-
verse effects provided very low-quality evidence. Total cardiovas-
cular events data were affected by a high risk of bias. Furthermore,
insufficient data were available on drug side effects, and as for
withdrawals, imprecision was especially marked, leading to further
downgrading of evidence quality. (See Summary of findings for
the main comparison).
Potential biases in the review process
Because of study requirements, none of the included studies were
blinded to participants or clinical researchers. However, all stud-
ies implemented mechanisms to assess outcomes by independent
blinded committees. Consequently, potential performance bias
was considered high and detection bias was judged as low.
Another potential source of bias came from the fact that most
included participants (all but those in SPS3 2013) were part of
subgroup studies and some (25% non hypertensive participants
in SPS3 2013) did not comply with our inclusion criteria. SPS3
2013 data were included because the participants who complied
with our inclusion criteria reached the predefined 70% threshold.
However, to adapt the study interventions to those defined in
our review, HOT 1998 participants in two different targets (< 85
mmHg and < 80 mmHg) were pooled for only the lower blood
pressure target.
Additionally, primary outcomes in AASK 2002 were not aligned
with our review’s interest. It must also be stressed that most sub-
groups included a high number of participants and all were ana-
lyzed as individual patient data.
The differences between trials in type and definition of outcomes
could also be a source of bias (see Outcomes in Characteristics of
included studies tables). For example, not all studies provided ad-
equate information about how silent myocardial infarctions were
dealt with, revealing differences among studies that included heart
failure hospitalization as an outcome.
No homogeneous information among trials was observed for se-
rious adverse events, the most comprehensive outcome on safe.
Only SPRINT 2015 was deemed to report the total number of
serious adverse events, according to its international standardized
definition (ICH 1995). Other included trials provided an unre-
liably low number of serious adverse events (HOT 1998; SPS3
2013); reported only those events judged by researchers as prob-
ably related to the interventions (ACCORD BP 2010); consid-
ered serious adverse events from a extremely narrow perspective
(Past BP 2016); or did not offer any specific information on this
outcome (AASK 2002). Deaths, major cardiovascular events and
serious adverse effects reported by trialists were included as seri-
ous adverse events in analyses when only partial information was
available. Because of these concerns, reporting bias was strongly
suspected for certain outcomes such as serious adverse events and
withdrawals due to adverse effects, where few data were reported.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review with meta-
analysis that assessed blood pressure targets in people with es-
tablished cardiovascular disease from randomized controlled trials
that directly compared different target strategies.
We found no evidence of additional benefit from a lower blood
pressure target compared to a standard blood pressure target in
terms of total mortality or cardiovascular mortality. We found a
slight decrease in total cardiovascular events in favour of the lower
blood pressure target (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98), with no
difference in total serious adverse events between strategies.
Some prominent hypertension guidelines (JNC-8 2014; NICE
2016) have not issued direct recommendations on blood pressure
targets for people with previous cardiovascular disease. Those re-
views or guidelines that include explicit recommendations mainly
come from observational data or post hoc analyses of achieved
blood pressure in trials designed for various purposes (Bangalore
2013). This perspective could easily lead to selection bias, favour-
ing a lower risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event in partici-
pants with lower achieved blood pressure. Only one study (SPS3
2013) directly compared clinical outcomes in people who had
stroke treated to different blood pressure targets; no studies have
been conducted in people with cardiovascular disease.
Our results do not seem to support the widespread implementa-
tion of an intensive target strategy (≤ 135/85 mmHg) for car-
diovascular secondary prevention. The conservative approach is
22

 also recommended by ESH-ESC 2013 and CHEP 2015, where a
< 140/90 mmHg target has been recommended in most patient
situations, including people with previous cardiovascular disease.
In addition, a similar systematic review on chronic kidney dis-
ease did not show either that a blood pressure target < 125/75 to
130/80 mmHg is more beneficial than a target < 140/90 mmHg
(Upadhyay 2011).
However, based on SPRINT 2015 data, CHEP 2016 recommends
consideration of lower targets in some high cardiovascular risk
patients. Other guidelines, such as Joint ESC 2016, Rosendorff
2015 and Kernan 2014, only partially agree with our view. In Joint
ESC 2016 a 130 to 139 mmHg systolic target is recommended,
whereas a more intensive effort (80 to 85 mmHg) is supported as
the diastolic goal. No specific supportive evidence was provided
on this statement. Two American guidelines focusing on coronary
and stroke patients are available. Rosendorff 2015 suggests < 140/
90 mmHg as a reasonable target for secondary prevention of car-
diovascular events in coronary patients, but a lower target (< 130/
80 mmHg) is also considered useful for some individuals, but they
admitted that this is not supported by evidence and no additional
details of potential benefit profiles were offered. Kernan 2014 rec-
ommends a < 140/90 mmHg target strategy as a general rule for
stroke patients but points out that 130/80 mmHg could be rea-
sonable for patients with a recent lacunar stroke, based mainly on
SPS3 2013 results. However, the SPS3 2013 study did not achieve
a statistically significant difference between lower and standard
targets for any of the primary or secondary outcomes measured. In
SPS3 2013 the difference detected in intracerebral haemorrhages
(a subtype of intracranial haemorrhages not pre-planned even as a
secondary outcome) could well have been due to chance. Surpris-
ingly, despite there being no substantial benefit confirmed with
the lower target, the SPS3 2013 authors concluded that, based on
their results, the use of a systolic blood pressure target of < 130
mmHg was likely to be beneficial in patients with recent lacunar
stroke.
A recent systematic review (Ettehad 2016) identified large-scale
blood pressure lowering trials to quantify the effects of reducing
10 mmHg (systolic blood pressure) in terms of mortality and car-
diovascular outcomes. This analysis was conducted for the main
comparison and several subgroups, one of them in patients with
established cardiovascular disease. The results showed benefits for
this subgroup in mortality and cardiovascular events when blood
pressure was reduced, but inconsistent results in safety outcomes
were also reported. The authors concluded that lowering cur-
rent normotensive levels are supported by their review, provided
there is a relevant absolute risk. In this regard, relevant limitations
must be taken into account. First, heterogeneity was extremely
high in Ettehad 2016, including large differences among popula-
tions, basal comorbidities and comparisons in treatment groups.
In fact, some included studies compared the effect of different
blood pressure targets, the effect of different drugs, or even drugs
versus placebo. Second, the review did not consider individual pa-
tient data, leading to a particularly low accuracy when conclusions
are assumed on participants with or without basal cardiovascular
disease. Finally, among the included studies comparing different
blood pressure targets, too diverse strategies were mixed, from <
120 mmHg to < 150 mmHg systolic blood pressure target. Cer-
tainly this review has been able to gather a big amount of informa-
tion but, at the same time, a careful approach should be demanded
in order to not draw misleading conclusions.
Another systematic review (Xie 2016) has paid attention to clini-
cal trials comparing only blood pressure targets. While this design
seems to be more appropriate than in the previous case, inclusion
criteria were also established with high laxity. Limits are not well
defined with regard to what is considered an intensive or standard
target. Because of that, two studies can share the same target but,
simultaneously, be assigned to different groups, standard or inten-
sive (Brunström 2016). Participants with a wide range of blood
pressure targets are mixed leading to little informative results, even
if data from a large number of patients were collected. The authors
declare that, in high cardiovascular risk, benefits from intensive
treatment clearly overcome potential harms, even in patients with
< 140 mmHg, claiming for changes in current guidelines.
In contrast, our systematic review does not support that view.
We have not identified any advantages after taking into account
more appropriate inclusion criteria, substantial amount of indi-
vidual patient data and despite the benefit found in terms of total
cardiovascular events, when a more informative outcome, ’serious
adverse events’, was considered. Furthermore, even if SPRINT
2015 mortality results show a trend favouring the lower strategy,
no overall benefits in these outcomes were detected and adverse
events were poorly informed by all the concerned clinical trials.
In our opinion, whereas the scientific community is dealing with
this key lack of information, recommendations on blood pressure
targets in hypertensive patients with cardiovascular disease should
give priority to caution.

Implications for practice
The best evidence available at this time from randomized con-
trolled trials does not support blood pressure targets < 140 to 160/
90 to 100 mmHg in people with hypertension and established
cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic pe-
ripheral vascular occlusive disease or angina pectoris).
We analysed systolic, diastolic or mean blood pressure goals as a
whole and separately, with similar findings. In addition to the lack
of benefit in total or cardiovascular mortality for the lower blood
pressure target, the slight decrease in total cardiovascular events
linked to a lower systolic blood pressure target needs to be con-
sidered within the context of the numerical increase in mortality
and serious adverse events.

Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Predefined subgroup analyses in older people, those with diabetes,
or based on participant’s sex did not suggest any differences in
these conclusions.
According to the best available evidence, lower targets for people
with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease do not
achieve a net health benefit.
Implications for research
Well designed, randomized controlled trials assessing lower blood
pressure targets in people with hypertension and established car-
diovascular disease are needed to ascertain the benefits and harms
from intensive and more conservative strategies.
Six ongoing studies in people with stroke and coronary dis-
ease have been identified (ESH-CHL-SHOT 2014; HOSP
2006; INFINITY 2013; ISRCTN37694103; NCT01198496;
NCT03015311) but additional studies exploring other types of
basal cardiovascular diseases are also required (e.g. peripheral vas-
cular disease, haemorrhagic stroke, etc). Future research should
aim to report mortality rates and all serious adverse event out-
comes.
Having access to individual patient data and other relevant docu-
ments (protocols, clinical study reports, raw data) becomes a ma-
jor strength of systematic reviews with meta-analysis. Thus, au-
thors of past or future trials are highly encouraged to share their
databases.

AASK 2002
Methods
Multicenter, 3 x 2 factorial design, intention-to-treat (ITT) strategy. Participants ran-
domized equally to a usual mean arterial pressure goal of 102 to 107 mmHg or to a lower
mean arterial pressure goal of 92 mmHg or lower, and to treatment with metoprolol,
ramipril or amlodipine. When the blood pressure goal was not achieved using the ran-
domized drug, other open-labelled antihypertensive agents were added to participants’
treatment. Participants and investigators were not masked to the blood pressure goal
The follow-up was 3 to 6.4 years (mean 3.8 years).
Participants
African-American men and women, aged 18 to 70 years, with hypertension defined as
sitting DBP ≥ 95 mmHg and reduced kidney function, defined as glomerular filtration
rate (GFR) between 20 and 65 mL/min per 1.73 m². Exclusion criteria included DBP
< 95 mmHg, known history of diabetes mellitus, urinary protein to creatinine ratio >
2.5, accelerated or malignant hypertension within 6 months, secondary hypertension,
evidence of non blood pressure-related causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD), serious
systemic disease or clinical congestive heart failure (CHF)
Baseline characteristics for participants included in the review (%) or mean ± SD): men/
women (68/32%); age (57 ± 9 years); SBP (149 ± 28 mmHg); DBP (93 ± 16 mmHg);
mean blood pressure (MBP) (112 ± 19 mmHg); current smoker (31%); types of drugs
at 1 year: No information available. Previous cardiovascular condition: ischaemic heart
disease (IHD) (25%), stroke (69%), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) (23%)
Country: USA
Interventions
Standard (usual) target: MBP 102 to 107 mmHg
Lower target: MBP < 92 mmHg
Outcomes
The primary analysis was based on the rate of change in GFR (GFR slope).
As a key secondary analysis, all cardiovascular events including cardiovascular deaths and
hospitalizations for myocardial infarctions (MI), strokes, heart failure, revascularization
procedures and other hospitalised cardiovascular events were reviewed and classified by
a blinded endpoints committee according to a prespecified protocol

signed to either intensive or standard blood pressure control
The follow-up was 4 to 8 years (mean 4.7 years)
Participants
Men and women with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a glycated haemoglobin level of 7.5%
or more, aged 40 to 79 years with cardiovascular disease or 55 to 79 years with anatomical
evidence of a substantial amount of atherosclerosis, albuminuria, left ventricular hyper-
trophy, or at least two additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease (dyslipidaemia,
hypertension, smoking or obesity)
Exclusion criteria included body mass index (BMI) > 45, serum creatinine (sCR) level >
1.5 mg/dL and other serious illness. Participants with SBP between 130 and 180 mmHg
who were taking three or fewer antihypertensive medications and who had the equivalent
of a 24-hour protein excretion rate < 1.0 g were also eligible for the blood pressure trial
Baseline characteristics for participants included in the review (% or mean ± SD): men/
women (63/37%); age (62 ± 8 years); age ≥ 75 years (7%); SBP (138 ± 16 mmHg); DBP
(74 ± 11 mmHg); current smoker (13%); ethnic group: White (62%), non White (38%)
. Types of drugs at 1 year: thiazides (51%), ACEI/ARB (84%), calcium channel blockers

Outcomes
The primary end point for ACCORD was the first occurrence of a major cardiovas-
cular event, which was defined as the composite of non fatal MI, non fatal stroke, or
cardiovascular death. Prespecified secondary outcomes included the combination of the
primary outcome plus revascularization or hospitalization for CHF; the combination of
a fatal coronary event, non fatal MI, or unstable angina; non fatal MI; fatal or non fatal
stroke; non fatal stroke; death from any cause; death from cardiovascular causes; and
hospitalization or death due to heart failure

Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was change in SBP between baseline and 12 months.
Key secondary outcomes included side effects, tolerability and adverse events; clinical
outcomes (including major cardiovascular events (composite of fatal and non fatal stroke,
MI or fatal CHD and other cardiovascular death), all cause mortality and hospital
admissions). Key secondary events (stroke, MI, fatal CHD and other cardiovascular
death) were reviewed by independent clinicians blinded to treatment to ensure unbiased
coding of these events

Methods
Multicentre open-label clinical trial, ITT strategy, 2 x 2 factorial design with random-
ization to both an antiplatelet intervention and a target level of SBD control
The follow-up was 0 to 8.6 years (mean 3.7 years)
Participants
Eligible participants were aged ≥ 30 years, were normotensive or hypertensive, had a
recent(within180days), symptomatic, MRI-confirmedlacunarstroke, andwere without
surgically amenable ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis or high-risk cardio-embolic sources.
Main exclusion criteria included disabling stroke (modified Rankin score ≥ 4), previous
intracranial haemorrhage from non traumatic causes, or cortical ischaemic stroke
Baseline characteristics for participants included in the review (% or mean ± SD): men/
women (63/37%); age (63 years); SBP (143 ± 19 mmHg); DBP (79 ± 11 mmHg);
diabetes (37%); current smoker (20%); ethnic group: White (51%), non White (49%)
. Types of drugs at 1 year: thiazides (45%), ACEI/ARB (63%), CCB (32%), BB (25%)
, other (12%). Previous cardiovascular condition: IHD (10%), stroke (99%)
Countries: USA, Canada, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina and Spain
Interventions
Standard (higher) target: SBP 130 to 149 mmHg
Lower target: SBP < 130 mmHg
Outcomes
The primary outcome was time to recurrent stroke (first of fatal or non fatal ischaemic
stroke or central nervous system haemorrhage). All possible clinical stroke events are
assessed at the clinical site by both the local neurology investigator and a neurologist
blinded to the assigned treatment arms. Secondary outcomes included acute MI and
death, classified as vascular or non vascular. Safety events were major cognitive decline,
major extracranial (systemic) haemorrhage, serious complication of hypotension and
other SPS3-related serious adverse events
Serious adverse events were major vascular events and severe adverse events related to
hypotension. No information about non vascular deaths or severe adverse events other
than hypotension-related was provided

Notes
The antiplatelet component of the trial was terminated at the recommendation of the
data and safety monitoring committee because of lack of efficacy combined with evidence
of harm
The blood pressures achieved at the end of the trial were: standard target: SBP 138 ± 1
mmHg; lower target: SBP 127 ± 1 mmHg

ABCD-H 1998
Methods
Multicentre, controlled, randomized, 2 x 2 factorial design. The ABCD-H trial included hypertensive (DBP ≥90.0
mmHg) non insulin-dependent diabetic participants (NIDDM). Participants were randomized to one of four arms:
intensive treatment with nisoldipine, intensive treatment with enalapril, moderate treatment with nisoldipine, or
moderate treatment with enalapril. Participants and investigators were not masked to blood pressure goal
The follow-up was 5 years
Participants
Adults with NIDDM aged between 40 and 74 years and a minimum DBP ≥ 90.0 mmHg were recruited. Exclusion
criteria included MI, unstable angina or CVA within the previous six months, CABG surgery within the previous
three months, Class III-IV NYHA CHF, absolute need for therapy with ACEI or CCBs, haemodialysis or peritoneal
dialysis, or serum creatinine concentration > 3 mg/dL (265 mmol/L)
Country: USA
Interventions
Standard (moderate) target: DBP 80.0 to 89.0 mmHg
Intensive target: DBP ≤ 75.0 mmHg
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was the effect of intensive or moderate blood pressure control on the change in the 24 hour
creatinine clearance, which was assessed every six months. Secondary end points included the effect of intensive
as compared with moderate blood pressure control on the incidence of cardiovascular events, retinopathy, clinical
neuropathy, urinary albumin excretion, and left ventricular hypertrophy
All cardiovascular events were reviewed by an independent endpoints committee blinded to the patients’ assigned
treatment groups. Cardiovascular outcomes were defined as death due to cardiovascular events (sudden death, pro-
gressive heart failure, fatal MI, fatal arrhythmias, CVAs, or ruptured aortic aneurysm); non fatal MI; non fatal CVA;
heart failure requiring hospital admission; or pulmonary infarction

BBB 1994
Methods
Multicentre, prospective, randomized open with blinded end point (PROBE) design
Participants
Adults aged 47 to 67 years were included if their treated DBP was in the range 90 to 100 mmHg on at least three
consecutive visits. Specific exclusion criteria were: history of IHD, pathological ECG or both, somatic disorders
expected to cause a significant deterioration in health within the next few years or inability to participate
Country: Sweden
Interventions
Standard (unchanged) target: DBP 90 to 100 mmHg
Intensive target: DBP ≤ 80 mmHg
Outcomes
Three main questions were asked:
1. Whether DBP ≤ 80 mmHg could be obtained in previously “well-treated” people with hypertension;
2. Whether additional reduction in blood pressure could be obtained without increasing the incidence or severity
of side effects to unacceptable levels;
3. Whether further reduction in DBP would be associated with further reduction in hypertension-induced
cardiovascular complications, or whether such further lowering of blood pressure would be associated with
increased morbidity and mortality in accordance with the J-curve concept.
Notes
Study data have been lost. The principal author (Prof Lennart Hansson) is deceased; Dr Bjorn Dahlöf confirmed that
data have not been retained. Bayer was also contacted but confirmed the company does not have any data available
for the BBB study. The journal Blood Pressure, in which BBB results were published, confirmed the manuscript
received was essentially as the published, and the documentation was destroyed about 10 years before (following Prof
Hansson’s death). The Swedish Council on Heath Tecnology Assessment assessed the study in a report (No. 170/
2) but did not have access to the original data. We also approached the Östra Hospital, where Prof Hansson was
working at the time the study was conducted. No records were found, and we were told that
the legal requirement
to keep records safe expired after 15 years

Country: Italy
Interventions
Standard (conventional) target: SBP < 140 mmHg
Lower (aggressive) target: SBP < 130 mmHg
Outcomes
The primary study outcome was the prevalence of electrocardiographic LV (left ventricular) hypertrophy at the final
two year visit. The main prespecified secondary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, non fatal MI, non
fatal stroke, TIA, CHF NYHA stages III-IV requiring hospitalization, angina pectoris with objective evidence of
myocardial ischaemia, new-onset atrial fibrillation, coronary revascularization, aortic dissection, occlusive peripheral
arterial disease, and kidney failure requiring dialysis
For participants with more than one event, the survival time up to the first event was used in the analysis. The
comparison between the groups in the serial changes in SBP and DBP was another secondary end point of the study
Notes
216 participants (115 standard, 101 lower) met the inclusion criteria for the review but additional information on
outcomes is needed to obtain useful data. The authors were contacted and they forwarded our questions to the

disease (history of smoking, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes, long standing hypertension, family history).
Participants had visible (≥ 0.5%) white matter hyper intensities lesions on cerebral MRI screening. To be
eligible for inclusion, participants needed to maintain 24 hour SBP < 145 mmHg in the standard treatment
group or SBP < 130 mmHg in the intensive treatment group if the clinical SBP was 150 to 170 mmHg and
taking 0 to 2 antihypertensives, or SBP was > 170 mmHg and taking 0 to 1 antihypertensives
Exclusion criteria included uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (HBA1c > 10%), history of stroke, dementia, or
clinically impaired gait, body mass index > 45 kg/m² and/or arm circumference > 44 cm), poor kidney
function, active liver disease or serum transaminases > 3 times the upper limit of normal, major cardiovascular
event (e.g. MI) or procedure (e.g. CABG surgery) in past 3 months, uncompensated CHF, or chronic atrial
fibrillation that disallows ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to be successfully performed
Interventions
Standard target: 24 h SBP < 145 mmHg
Intensive target: 24 h SBP < 130 mmHg
Outcomes
Primary outcome measures: change from baseline in mobility parameters (self-paced walk and stance times), at
18 months and at 36 months; and change from baseline in cognitive function (executive function, processing
speed), at 18 months and at 36 months.
Secondary outcome measures: Accrual of white matter hyperintensity over 36 months including degeneration
of tissue and tissue perfusion. Adverse events, tolerability, and health-related quality of life were also to be
evaluated

Trial name or title
PRESERVE Study
Methods
Randomized controlled trial, interventional
Participants
Participant inclusion criteria:
1. Clinical evidence of cerebral small vessel disease with MRI evidence of lacunar infarcts (≤ 1.5 cm
maximum diameter) and confluent leukoaraiosis (small vessel disease) (defined on Fazekas scale as ≥ grade
2).
2. Clinical evidence of cerebral small vessel disease is defined as lacunar stroke syndrome with symptoms
lasting > 24 hours.
3. TIA lasting < 24 hours with limb weakness, hemisensory loss or dysarthria and with MRI DWI
performed acutely showing lacunar infarction, or if MRI is not performed acutely (> 2 weeks after TIA)
with a lacunar infarction in an anatomically appropriate position on MRI.
4. Vascular cognitive impairment with MRI showing no evidence of hippocampal atrophy.
5. SBP > 140 mmHg.
6. Taking no more than two blood pressure lowering drugs at assessed for study participation.
7. Aged 40 years or over.
8. Not diagnosed with dementia and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 21.
9. Able and willing to consent.
10. Expected life expectancy > 2 years.
11. Able to perform study cognitive assessment.
Participant exclusion criteria
1. Unable or unwilling to consent.
2. Women of childbearing age.
3. MMSE < 21 or diagnosis of dementia on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM IV) criteria.
4. Life expectancy < 2 years.
5. Symptomatic postural hypotension.
6. Known single gene disorder causing small vessel disease (e.g. CADASI).
7. Cortical infarction (> 2 cm maximum diameter).
8. Symptomatic carotid stenosis or vertebral stenosis > 70% as measured on NASCET criteria
Interventions
Participants randomized to either intensive or standard blood pressure treatment. The intensive blood pressure
lowering arm aims for SBP < 125 mmHg. The standard blood pressure lowering arm aims for SBP 130 to
140 mmHg, as recommended by current guidelines. The trial will compare two strategies for lowering blood
pressure not looking at specific blood pressure drugs
Outcomes
Primary outcome: Composite cognitive score, which is an overall score for the cognitive tests carried out at
baseline, 12 months and 24 months
Secondary outcome measures:
1. Results of specific cognitive tests;
2. Disability measures;
3. Quality of life questionnaires;
4. Blood pressure readings (taken at all visits);

Trial name or title
RESPECT Study
Methods
Multicentre, randomized, parallel, open-label study.
The follow-up period will be 3 years
Participants
Men and women aged 50 to 85 years, hypertensive patients and history of stroke who satisfy the following
criteria:
1. Outpatient;
2. Onset of stroke between 30 days and 3 years before date of consent;
3. Drug adherence ≥ 80% during the screening period;
4. Mean of 2 baseline blood pressure measurements is either 180 > SBP ≥ 130 mmHg or 110 > DBP ≥
80 mmHg;
5. Cerebral infarction with severity 3 or less on the modified Rankin scale.
Exclusion criteria include secondary or severe hypertension, MI or angioplasty within 3 months prior to the
screening, current or previous heart failure with NYHA classification class III or more, or ejection fraction <
35%, severe bilateral carotid stenosis or major cerebral artery occlusion, severe paralysis due to stroke, current
kidney or liver dysfunction
Interventions
Standard target: < 140/90 mmHg (or < 130/80 if current diabetes, kidney disease or MI)
Intensive target: < 120/80 mmHg
Outcomes
Primary outcome measures: prevention of recurrent stroke. Participants on blood pressure treatment achieving
their respective blood pressure target will be followed for recurrence of stroke.
Secondary outcome measures: Incidence of events other than stroke. Under strict blood pressure control,
not only the recurrence of stroke but also occurrence of cardiovascular events (such as MI and heart failure),
angioplasty, and death will be reduced
