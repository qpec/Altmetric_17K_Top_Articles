Abstract
Problem/Condition: Malaria in humans is caused by intraerythrocytic protozoa of the genus Plasmodium. These parasites are 
transmitted by the bite of an infective female Anopheles mosquito. The majority of malaria infections in the United States occur 
among persons who have traveled to regions with ongoing malaria transmission. However, malaria is also occasionally acquired by 
persons who have not traveled out of the country through exposure to infected blood products, congenital transmission, laboratory 
exposure, or local mosquitoborne transmission. Malaria surveillance in the United States is conducted to identify episodes of local 
transmission and to guide prevention recommendations for travelers.
Period Covered: This report summarizes cases in persons with onset of illness in 2013 and summarizes trends during previous years.
Description of System: Malaria cases diagnosed by blood film, polymerase chain reaction, or rapid diagnostic tests are mandated 
to be reported to local and state health departments by health care providers or laboratory staff. Case investigations are conducted 
by local and state health departments, and reports are transmitted to CDC through the National Malaria Surveillance System, 
National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, or direct CDC consultations. CDC conducted antimalarial drug resistance 
marker testing on blood samples submitted to CDC by health care providers or local/state health departments. Data from these 
reporting systems serve as the basis for this report.
Results: CDC received 1,727 reported cases of malaria, including two congenital cases, with an onset of symptoms in 2013 
among persons in the United States. The total number of cases represents a 2% increase from the 1,687 cases reported for 2012. 
Plasmodium falciparum, P
. vivax, P
. malariae, and P
. ovale were identified in 61%, 14%, 3%, and 4% of cases, respectively. Forty 
(2%) patients were infected by two species. The infecting species was unreported or undetermined in 17% of cases. Polymerase 
chain reaction testing determined or corrected the species for 85 of the 137 (62%) samples evaluated for drug resistance marker 
testing. Of the 904 patients who reported purpose of travel, 635 (70%) were visiting friends or relatives (VFR). Among the 961 
cases in U.S. civilians for whom information on chemoprophylaxis use and travel region was known, 42 (4%) patients reported 
that they had initiated and adhered to a chemoprophylaxis drug regimen recommended by CDC for the regions to which they 
had traveled. Thirty-six cases were reported in pregnant women, none of whom had adhered to chemoprophylaxis. Among all 
reported cases, approximately 270 (16%) were classified as severe illnesses in 2013. Of these, 10 persons with malaria died in 
2013, the highest number since 2001. In 2013, a total of 137 blood samples submitted to CDC were tested for molecular markers 
associated with antimalarial drug resistance. Of the 100 P
. falciparum-positive samples, 95 were tested for pyrimethamine resistance: 
88 (93%) had genetic polymorphisms associated with pyrimethamine drug resistance, 74 (76%) with sulfadoxine resistance, 53 
(53%) with chloroquine resistance, one (1%) with atovaquone resistance, none with mefloquine drug resistance, and none with 
artemisinin resistance.
Interpretation: The overall trend of malaria cases has been increasing since 1973; the number of cases reported in 2013 is the 
third highest annual total since then. Despite progress in reducing the global burden of malaria, the disease remains endemic in 
many regions, and the use of appropriate prevention measures by travelers is still inadequate.
Public Health Actions: Completion of data elements on the malaria case report form increased slightly in 2013 compared with 
2012, but still remains unacceptably low. This incomplete reporting compromises efforts to examine trends in malaria cases and 
prevent infections. VFRs continue to be a difficult population to reach with effective malaria prevention strategies. Evidence-
based prevention strategies that effectively target VFRs need to be developed and implemented to have a substantial impact on 
the numbers of imported malaria cases in the United States. Fewer patients reported taking chemoprophylaxis in 2013 (32%) 
compared with 2012 (34%), and adherence was poor among 
those who did take chemoprophylaxis. Proper use of malaria 
chemoprophylaxis will prevent the majority of malaria illness 
and reduce the risk for severe disease (http://www.cdc.gov/
malaria/travelers/drugs.html). Malaria infections can be fatal

Introduction
Malaria in humans is caused by infection with one or more 
of several species of Plasmodium (i.e., P
. falciparum, P
. vivax, 
P
. ovale, P
. malariae, and occasionally other Plasmodium species) 
parasites. The parasite is transmitted by the bite of an infective 
female Anopheles mosquito. P
. falciparum and P
. vivax species 
cause the most infections worldwide. P
. falciparum is the 
agent that most commonly causes severe and potentially fatal 
malaria (see Definitions). An estimated 198 million clinical 
cases and 584,000 (0.3%) deaths were reported worldwide 
in 2013, mostly among children aged <5 years living in sub-
Saharan Africa (1). P
. vivax and P
. ovale have dormant liver 
stages, which can reactivate and cause malaria several months 
or years after the initial infection. P
. malariae can result in 
long-lasting infections and, if untreated or inadequately 
treated, can persist asymptomatically in the human host for 
years, even a lifetime (2). Approximately half of the world’s 
population live in regions where malaria is transmitted (i.e., 
approximately 100 countries in parts of Africa, Asia, the 
Middle East, Eastern Europe, Central and South America, 
the Caribbean, and Oceania) (2). Before the 1950s, malaria 
was endemic throughout the southeastern United States; an 
estimated 600,000 cases occurred in 1914 (3). During the late 
1940s, a combination of improved housing and socioeconomic 
conditions, environmental management, vector-control efforts, 
and case management was successful at interrupting malaria 
transmission in the United States (4).* Since then, malaria case 
surveillance has been maintained to detect locally acquired 
cases that could indicate instances of local transmission, to 
monitor patterns of resistance to antimalarial drugs, and to 
guide malaria prevention recommendations for international 
travelers. Malaria vector mosquitoes are still present in the 
United States (5).
The majority of reported malaria cases diagnosed each 
year in the United States are imported from regions where 
mosquitoborne malaria transmission is known to occur, 
although congenital infections and infections resulting from 
exposure to blood or blood products also are reported in the 
United States (6). In addition, rare cases of local mosquitoborne 
transmission have been reported (7). State and local health 
departments and CDC investigate reported malaria cases in 
the United States, and CDC analyzes data from imported cases 
to detect trends in acquisition.
The signs and symptoms of malaria illness are varied, 
but the majority of patients have fever (8). Other common 
symptoms include headache, back pain, chills, increased 
sweating, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and cough. 
A diagnosis of malaria should always be considered for persons 
with these symptoms who have traveled to an area with known 
malaria transmission. Malaria also should be considered in the 
differential diagnosis of persons who have fever of unknown 
origin, regardless of their travel history. Untreated infections 
can rapidly progress to coma, renal failure, respiratory distress, 
and death. This report summarizes malaria cases reported to 
CDC among persons with onset of symptoms in 2013.
Methods
Data Sources and Analysis 
Malaria case data were reported to the National Malaria 
Surveillance System (NMSS) and the National Notifiable 
Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) (9). Although both 
systems rely on passive reporting, the numbers of reported cases 
might vary because of differences in collection and transmission 
of data. A substantial difference between the data collected in 
these two systems is that NMSS receives more detailed clinical 
and epidemiologic data regarding each case (e.g., information 
concerning the area to/from which the infected person has 
traveled). Malaria cases can be reported to CDC through 
either NMSS or NNDSS or through a direct consultation 
with CDC malaria staff; therefore, cases reported through 
these various paths are compared, unduplicated, compiled, 
and analyzed. The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center 
(AFHSC) provided information about additional military 
cases that were not reported to state health departments, and 
those were added to the NMSS database. This report presents 
data on the aggregate of cases reported to CDC through all 
reporting systems.
if not diagnosed and treated promptly with antimalarial medications appropriate for the patient’s age and medical history, the 
likely country of malaria acquisition, and previous use of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Recent molecular laboratory advances 
have enabled CDC to identify and conduct molecular surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance markers (http://www.cdc.gov/
malaria/features/ars.html). These advances will allow CDC to track, guide treatment, and manage drug resistance in malaria 
parasites both domestically and globally. For this to be successful, specimens should be submitted for all cases diagnosed in the 
United States. Clinicians should consult the CDC Guidelines for Treatment of Malaria and contact the CDC’s Malaria Hotline 
for case management advice, when needed. Malaria treatment recommendations can be obtained online (http://www.cdc.gov/
malaria/diagnosis_treatment) or by calling the Malaria Hotline (770-488-7788 or toll-free at 855-856-4713).

Malaria cases are classified as confirmed or suspected using 
the 2009 Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists 
(CSTE)/CDC case definition (10). Malaria cases are further 
categorized by infecting species: Plasmodium falciparum, 
P
. vivax, P
. malariae, and P
. ovale. When more than a single 
species is detected, the case is categorized as a mixed infection. 
All categories are mutually exclusive. Diagnosis of malaria is 
made by blood film microscopy or polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR). A rapid diagnostic test (RDT) can be used to detect 
malaria antigens; however, the diagnosis must be confirmed by 
either microscopy or PCR to be counted as a case (i.e., only 
confirmed cases are included in this report). Each malaria case 
is reported by health care providers or laboratories to local or 
state health departments and to CDC. CDC staff review all 
reports, when received, and request additional information 
from the provider or the state, if necessary (e.g., when no 
recent travel is reported to or from a country where malaria 
is endemic). Reports of other cases are telephoned to CDC 
directly by health care providers, usually when they are seeking 
assistance with diagnosis or treatment. Information regarding 
cases reported directly to CDC is shared with the relevant 
state health department. All cases that have been reported as 
acquired in the United States are investigated further, including 
all induced, congenital, introduced, and cryptic cases (see 
Definitions). Information derived from uniform case report 
forms is entered into a database and analyzed annually (http://
www.cdc.gov/malaria/resources/pdf/report/malaria_form.pdf).
The chi-square test was used to calculate p values and assess 
differences between variables reported in 2012 compared with 
previous years. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. Linear regression using least-squares methods was 
used to calculate the average increase in the number of cases 
since the early 1970s.
Definitions
The following definitions are used in malaria surveillance 
for the United States:
• U.S. residents — Persons residing in the United States, 
including both civilian and U.S. military personnel, 
regardless of legal citizenship.
• U.S. civilians — Any U.S. residents, excluding U.S. 
military personnel.
• Foreign residents — Persons who hold resident status in 
a country other than the United States.
• Travelers visiting friends or relatives — Immigrants, 
ethnically and racially distinct from the major population 
of the country of residence (a country where malaria is 
not endemic), who return to their homeland (a country 
where malaria is endemic) to visit friends or relatives. 
Included in the visiting friends and relatives (VFR) 
category are family members (e.g., spouse or children) 
who were born in the country of residence.
• Laboratory criteria for diagnosis: Demonstration of 
malaria parasites on blood film, PCR, or by RDT 
(followed by blood film confirmation).
• Confirmed case: Symptomatic or asymptomatic infection 
that occurs in a person in the United States or one of its 
territories who has laboratory-confirmed (by microscopy 
or PCR) malaria parasitemia, regardless of whether the 
person had previous episodes of malaria while in other 
countries. A subsequent episode of malaria is counted as 
an additional case, regardless of indicated Plasmodium 
species, unless the case is indicated as a treatment failure 
resulting from drug resistance.
• Suspect case: Symptomatic or asymptomatic infection 
that occurs in a person in the United States or one of 
its territories who has Plasmodium species detected by 
rapid diagnostic antigen testing without confirmation 
by microscopy or PCR, regardless of whether the person 
experienced previous episodes of malaria while in 
other countries.
• Partial immunity: Immunity in persons born in malaria 
endemic areas who have survived multiple infections with 
malaria. Although these persons remain susceptible to 
malaria, their subsequent infections, however, are less likely 
to be severe. This protection from severe malaria wanes if 
the person is no longer exposed to repeated malaria 
infections. Several antibodies have been identified that are 
a part of the immune response to malaria, but no test can 
classify persons as immune or not.
This report also uses terminology derived from the 
recommendations of the World Health Organization (11). 
Definitions of the following terms are included for reference:
• Autochthonous malaria:
 
– Indigenous. Mosquitoborne transmission of malaria 
in a geographic area where malaria occurs regularly.
 
– Introduced. Mosquitoborne transmission of malaria 
from a person with an imported case in an area where 
malaria does not occur regularly.
• Imported malaria: Malaria acquired outside a specific 
area. In this report, imported cases are those acquired 
outside the United States and its territories.
• Induced malaria: Malaria acquired through artificial 
means (e.g., blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or 
by using shared syringes).
• Relapsing malaria: Recurrence of disease after it has been 
apparently cured. In malaria, true relapses are caused by 
reactivation of dormant liver-stage parasites (hypnozoites) 
of P
. vivax and P
. ovale.

• Severe malaria: A case of malaria with one or more of the 
following manifestations: neurologic symptoms, renal 
failure, severe anemia (defined by hemoglobin 
[Hb] <7g/dL), acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS), jaundice, or ≥5% parasitemia (12). To attempt 
to include severe cases in which clinical criteria were not 
reported, persons who were treated for severe malaria (i.e., 
artesunate, quinidine, and/or an exchange blood 
transfusion) despite having no specific severe manifestations 
reported also are counted as a severe case in this analysis.
• Cryptic malaria: A case of malaria for which epidemiologic 
investigations fail to identify a plausible mode of 
acquisition (this term applies primarily to cases found in 
countries where malaria is not endemic).
Laboratory Diagnosis of Malaria
To diagnose malaria promptly, physicians must obtain a 
travel history from every febrile patient. Malaria should be 
included in the differential diagnosis of every febrile patient 
who has traveled to a malarious area. If malaria is suspected, a 
Giemsa-stained film of the patient’s peripheral blood should 
be examined for parasites as soon as possible. Thick and thin 
blood films must be prepared correctly because diagnostic 
accuracy depends on blood film quality and examination by 
experienced laboratory personnel (13). This simple test can 
quickly detect the presence of malaria parasites and can also be 
used to determine the species and percentage of red blood cells 
that are infected, which are all essential to guiding appropriate 
treatment of persons infected with malaria. During the Ebola 
outbreak in West Africa that began in 2014, laboratories 
expressed concern that the Ebola virus might not be inactivated 
by the smear preparation process. As a result, CDC developed 
additional steps to inactivate viruses including Ebola during 
the slide preparation process (14). Some reference laboratories 
and health departments can diagnose malaria using PCR, 
although this is generally reserved for cases for which blood 
film diagnosis of malaria is inadequate and for confirmation 
of species. PCR results are also often not available quickly 
enough to be of use in the initial diagnosis and treatment of 
a patient with malaria.
In addition, BinaxNOW Malaria, an RDT that detects 
circulating malaria-specific antigens, is approved for use by 
hospital and commercial laboratories. Therefore, the test 
should be used in a clinical laboratory by trained staff; it 
should not be used by clinicians or the general public (15,16). 
In the United States, use of RDTs can decrease the amount of 
time required to determine whether a patient is infected with 
malaria but does not eliminate the need for standard tests (16). 
RDTs are not able to speciate or quantify malaria parasites. 
Positive and negative RDTs must be confirmed by microscopy 
(6), which is necessary to provide the additional information 
about species and density of infection. If microscopy was not 
performed, a PCR result can also be used to confirm RDT 
result and determine the species. 
Drug Resistance Marker Surveillance
In 2012, CDC’s Malaria Branch began molecular surveillance 
for malaria drug resistance markers. The goal is to evaluate cases 
of malaria diagnosed and treated in the United States as a means 
of detecting and characterizing malaria parasites that carry 
genetic markers (typically single nucleotide polymorphisms in 
one or more loci) associated with drug resistance. These data 
will help to understand where foci of resistance to different 
drugs might be present or emerging in specific parts of the 
world where malaria is endemic. For each sample submitted, 
species confirmation testing is conducted using a duplex 
real-time PCR capable of detecting the four human infecting 
Plasmodium species. For mixed infections, samples are also 
processed by nested-PCR using species-specific primers that 
accurately detect the minority population of the co-infecting 
malaria species. Molecular fingerprinting methods based on 
microsatellite markers and single nucleotide polymorphisms 
are used to identify antimalarial drug resistance markers for 
P
. falciparum samples only at this time. Additional species 
will be similarly evaluated as new laboratory methods are 
developed. Each sample submitted is tested for molecular 
markers associated with resistance to chloroquine, sulfadoxine-
pyrimethamine, mefloquine, atovaquone, and artemisinins.
The parasite DNA is subjected to PCR amplification 
using appropriate primers and sequenced using the Sanger 
method using the ABI 3130 capillary sequencer according 
to described methods (17). Fragments of genes encoding 
molecular targets of chloroquine (chloroquine resistance 
transporter gene, pfcrt), pyrimethamine (dihydrofolate 
reductase gene, dhfr), sulfadoxine (dihydropteroate synthase 
gene, dhps), atovaquone (cytochrome b gene, cytb), mefloquine 
(multidrug resistance 1 protein gene, pfmdr-1 and pfmdr-1 
copy number), and artemisinin (Mal13–1718319) were 
analyzed for polymorphisms by comparing each sequence to 
the reference genome. All reactions were conducted in triplicate 
on a Stratagene MX3005P (Agilent Technologies) real-time 
PCR machine. Resistance genes were assessed for the following 
drugs: chloroquine, pyrimethamine, sulfadoxine, atovaquone, 
mefloquine, and artemisinins.
Chloroquine resistance markers. The pfcrt gene sequence 
was analyzed to identify polymorphism at codons C72S, M74I, 
N75E, and K76T.

Pyrimethamine resistance markers. The dhfr gene sequence 
was analyzed to identify polymorphism at codons A16V, C50R, 
N51I, C59R, S108T/N, and I164L.
Sulfadoxine resistance markers. The dhps gene sequence 
was analyzed to identify polymorphism at codons S436A, 
A437G, and K540E.
Atovaquone resistance markers. The cyto b gene sequence 
was analyzed to identify polymorphism at codons I258M and 
Y268S (18).
Mefloquine resistance markers. The pfmdr-1 gene sequence 
was analyzed to identify polymorphism at codons N86Y, 
Y184F, S1034C, N1042D, and D1246Y.
pfmdr-1 copy number. A real-time PCR assay was used 
to determine the copy number of pfmdr-1 relative to that of 
a single copy gene, seryl-T synthetase, using the comparative 
cycle threshold (ΔΔCT) method (19). The measured copy 
number of the pfmdr-1 gene relative to that of a standard 
calibrator parasite, 3D7, which has a single copy of pfmdr-1. 
In addition, DNA from Indochina W2 and Dd2 was used as 
multiple copy number controls.
Artemisinin resistance markers: Pyrosequencing was used 
to test for artesmisinin resistance at previously reported (20) 
polymorphisms located on chromosome 10 (MAL10–688956) 
and chromosome 12 (MAL13–1718319) that are associated 
with artemisinin resistance in P
. falciparum parasites. Recently, 
another artemisinin resistance gene called kelch k13-propeller 
domain containing gene was reported (21). The k13-propeller 
domain was amplified using a nested PCR method previously 
described (21,22). The sequence data was analyzed using 
Geneious Pro R8 to identify polymorphisms associated with 
artemisinin resistance.
Resistance was then classified into levels on the basis of the 
number of accumulated mutations detected. Samples classified 
as sensitive demonstrated no mutations. For chloroquine, 
mefloquine, atovaquone, and artemisinin, resistance was 
defined as having detected any mutations. For pyrimethamine 
and sulfadoxine, resistance was defined as low if one mutation 
was detected, moderate if two mutations were detected, and 
high if three or more mutations were detected.
Results
General Surveillance
In 2013, CDC received 1,727 reports concerning cases of 
malaria among persons in the United States and its territories, 
representing a 2% increase from the 1,687 cases reported with 
onset of symptoms in 2012. Since 1973, the trend has been 
increasing in the total number of cases of malaria reported 
in the United States. On average, 28.8 additional cases are 
reported in the United States each year since 1973 (Figure 1). 
In 2013, a total of 1,137 cases occurred among U.S. residents, 
348 cases among foreign residents, and 242 cases among 
patients with unknown or unreported resident status (Table 1).
Plasmodium Species
Among the 1,727 cases reported in 2013, the infecting species 
of Plasmodium was identified and reported in 1,441 (83%) 
cases. Of the 1,441 cases, 104 had specimens submitted to 
CDC for species confirmatory testing. Overall, the proportion 
of cases with complete reporting of species was equal to that for 
2012 (83%) (Table 2) (6). P
. falciparum and P
. vivax comprised 
the majority of infections and were identified in 73% and 17% 
of 1,441 infected persons with species reported, respectively. 
The percentage of identified cases that were P
. vivax decreased 
approximately three percentage points from 2012. Among 
1,349 cases for whom both the region of acquisition and the 
infecting species were known, P
. falciparum accounted for 85% 
of infections acquired in Africa, 73% in Central America and 
the Caribbean, 24% in South America, 14% in Oceania, and 
9% in Asia (Table 3). In Central America and the Caribbean, 
the proportion of infections that were caused by P
. falciparum 
decreased by 7 percentage points compared with 2012. This 
was likely a result of a decrease in the total number of cases 
reported both across the region and from Haiti. Cases reported 
from Haiti decreased from a high of 171 in 2010 (23) to 22 
in 2013. Infections attributed to P
. vivax accounted for 86% 
acquired in Oceania, 80% in Asia, 67% in South America, 
22% in Central America and the Caribbean, and 5% in Africa.
Region of Acquisition and Diagnosis
Among the 1,727 reported cases, two congenital cases were 
reported and five cases did not have information reported 
to allow for their importation status to be determined. 
A total of 1,720 reported cases were classified as imported. 
Information on region of acquisition was missing for 203 
(12%) imported cases. Of 1,517 imported cases for which the 
region of acquisition was known, 1,250 (82%) were acquired 
in Africa, 164 (11%) in Asia, 41 (3%) in Central America 
and the Caribbean, 53 (3%) in South America, eight (1%) 
in Oceania, and one (<1%) in Europe (Table 3). Countries 
in West Africa† accounted for 832 (67%) cases acquired in 
Africa. Although the overall percent of cases acquired in West 
Africa remained unchanged from 2012, the distribution of 
cases within Africa changed; decreases in the number of cases 
acquired in Sudan (62 in 2012 and 41 in 2013) and Ethiopia 
† Countries that are considered West Africa include Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape 
Verde, Cóte d’Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, 
Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo, and West Africa, 
unspecified.

(41 in 2012 and 29 in 2013) were balanced out by increases 
in the number of cases acquired in Cameroon (31 in 2012 
and 63 in 2013), Liberia (100 in 2012 and 130 in 2013), 
and Nigeria (244 in 2012 and 265 in 2013). In Asia, the 
number of cases that were acquired in South Asia§ decreased 
significantly from 183 in 2012 to 147 in 2013; however, India 
was in the top five countries of acquisition. A decrease was 
observed in Afghanistan (79% reduction from 28 in 2012 to 
six in 2013) as a result of decreased cases among U.S. military 
personnel serving in Afghanistan. Four of the six cases acquired 
in Afghanistan were among U.S. military personnel. A 40% 
decrease occurred in cases acquired from Central America and 
the Caribbean in 2013 compared with 2012, attributed entirely 
to the 37% decrease in cases from Haiti (35 in 2012 and 22 
in 2013). The number of cases acquired in South America was 
not notably different from 2011 (35 in 2011, 41 in 2012, and 
53 in 2013), with the majority of cases acquired in Guyana 
and Peru (Table 3).
In the United States, eight reporting areas accounted for 
53% of the 1,727 reported malaria cases: New York City 
(n = 223), Maryland (n = 158), California (n = 115), New 
Jersey (n = 103), Texas (n = 91), Pennsylvania (n = 78), Virginia 
(n = 76), and Massachusetts (n = 75) (Figure 2). The states 
with the largest increase in reported malaria cases in 2013 were 
New Jersey, which increased by 61% to return to 2011 levels 
(104 in 2011, 64 in 2012, and 103 in 2013), and Maryland, 
which increased by 28% from 2012 (123 in 2012 versus 158 in 
2013). The states with the largest decrease in reported malaria 
cases in 2013 were Missouri with a 76% decrease (25 in 2012 
versus six in 2013) and Texas with a 17% decrease (110 in 
2012 versus 91 in 2013).
Imported Malaria by Resident Status
Among the 1,484 imported malaria cases of known resident 
status, 1,136 (77%) occurred among U.S. residents and 348 
(23%) among residents of other countries. Among the 1,136 
imported malaria cases among U.S. residents, 941 (83%) were 
acquired in Africa, 89 (8%) in Asia, 38 (3%) in South America, 
32 in Central America and the Caribbean (3%), and eight 
in Oceania (1%) (Table 4). This represents a significant 3% 
increase in cases among U.S. residents who acquired malaria in 
Africa compared with 2012 (921 in 2012 versus 941 in 2013) 
and a trend observed since 2008 (6,13, 23–25). The number of 
cases acquired in Asia decreased from 2012 (111 in 2012 versus 
89 in 2013), but this change was not statistically significant. 
Likewise, cases acquired in the Americas among U.S. residents 
decreased but not significantly compared with 2012 (82 in 
2012 versus 70 in 2013). No significant change was noted 
in the cases acquired in Oceania between 2012 and 2013. Of 
the 348 imported cases among foreign residents, 247 (71%) 
were acquired in Africa, 67 (19%) in Asia, 12 (3.4%) in South 
America, six (2%) in Central America and the Caribbean, and 
one (<1%) in Europe. The countries of acquisition with the

most significant reduction in the reported number of cases of 
malaria in foreign residents were India and Ghana, whereas 
cases acquired in Nigeria, Guyana, Liberia, and Cameroon 
increased among foreign residents. Among 239 foreign 
residents for whom purpose of visit to the United States was 
known, 68 (28%) were among VFRs and 126 (53%) occurred 
in recent immigrants or refugees, among whom 102 (81%) 
were from Africa.
Seasonality of Malaria Diagnosed in the 
United States
The total number of cases reported in the United States 
peaked in August and occurred primarily among persons who 
indicated travel to Africa (Figure 3). This likely correlated with 
peak travel times to African destinations related to summer 
holidays (26). The seasonality observed was attributed to the 
pattern of occurrence among P
. falciparum cases; the number 
of P
. vivax cases reported in the United States also peaked in 
August, but that peak was much smaller than for P
. falciparum. 
Most of those cases were among persons who indicated travel 
to Asia (most of whom had traveled to India).
Interval Between Arrival in the United States and 
Illness Onset
Among the 1,434 imported malaria cases with an identified 
Plasmodium species, the interval between the date of arrival in 
the United States and onset of illness was known for 980 (68%) 
cases (Table 5). Onset of symptoms began before arrival in the 
United States in 120 (12%) cases; the remaining 860 (88%) 
patients experienced malaria symptoms on or after arrival to the 
United States. Onset of malaria symptoms occurred 0–29 days 
after arrival in 620 (81%) of the 766 P
. falciparum cases and 
in 60 (45%) of the 133 P
. vivax cases.
Imported Malaria Among U.S. Military Personnel
In 2013, a total of 14 cases of imported malaria were reported 
among U.S. military personnel, a significant decrease from the 
92 reported in 2011 and the 43 reported in 2012. Region of 
travel was known for 11 cases and unspecified for three cases. 
Four military personnel reported travel to Afghanistan and 
four to various regions in Africa. One each reported travel 
to multiple countries in Central America and two reported 
travel to South Korea. Compared with 2012, fewer military 
personnel reported travel to Afghanistan and none reported 
travel to Haiti, likely as a result of changes in U.S. military 
presence in those regions (27). Information on infecting species 
was known for 13 cases; nine cases were identified as P
. vivax, 
two as P
. falciparum, and one each of P
. malariae and P
. ovale. 
Among those 13 cases, only six occurred in persons who 
reported having taken at least 1 dose of an appropriate drug 
for primary chemoprophylaxis; only one reported adhering 
to the regimen. Among the nine military personnel infected 
with P
. vivax, only two reported treatment with primaquine to 
avoid future relapses. Only one of the 14 cases was classified 
as severe; it was caused by P
. vivax infection.

* A case was defined as symptomatic or asymptomatic illness that occurs in the 
United States or one of its territories in a person who has laboratory-confirmed 
malaria parasitemia (microscopy or PCR), regardless of whether the person had 
previous attacks of malaria while in other countries. A subsequent attack of 
malaria occurring in a person is counted as an additional case if the demonstrated 
Plasmodium species differs from the initially identified species or if it is indicated 
as a relapsing infection demonstrating the same Plasmodium species as identified 
previously. If a subsequent attack of malaria occurring as a result of a drug 
resistance failure then the case is not counted as an additional case.

Chemoprophylaxis Use Among U.S. Civilians
Information about chemoprophylaxis use and travel area 
was known for 956 (85%) of the 1,122 U.S. civilians who 
had imported malaria. Of these 956 persons, 308 (32%) 
took chemoprophylaxis. Among the 308 persons who 
reported taking malaria chemoprophylaxis, 90 (29%) did 
not report a specific drug type taken. Of the remaining 218 
persons, 184 (84%) took a CDC-recommended medication 
and 22 (10%) took a medication that is not recommended 
by CDC for the area visited. Of the 184 who reported taking 
CDC-recommended chemoprophylaxis, 52 (28%) took 
mefloquine, 80 (43%) took doxycycline, 38 (21%) took 
atovaquone/proguanil, one (<1%) took chloroquine, none 
took primaquine, and 13 (7%) took more than one CDC-
recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis medication for the 
specific travel region. Information about infecting species was 
available for 162 (88%) patients who took a recommended 
antimalarial drug and was undetermined for the remaining 22 
patients. Moreover, among the 152 who reported taking CDC-
recommended chemoprophylaxis and for whom adherence was 
known, 110 (72%) reported nonadherence (i.e., missed doses).
Cases of P. vivax or P. ovale After Recommended 
Prophylaxis Use. Among the 162 patients who took a 
recommended medication for chemoprophylaxis and had 
information on infecting species, 21 (13%) cases were caused 
by P
. vivax, and 15 (9%) cases were caused by P
. ovale. Of the 
36 cases of P
. vivax or P
. ovale, information on 16 cases was 
insufficient (i.e., missing data regarding symptom onset or 
return date from travel) to assess if this was an acute infection or 
a relapse infection. Onset of symptoms for nine reported cases 
occurred >45 days after the patient arrived in the United States. 
The clinical features of these cases are consistent with relapsing 
infections and do not indicate primary prophylaxis failures. 
Eleven cases occurred ≤45 days after the patient returned 
to the United States; these cases are consistent with acute 
infection and could indicate primary prophylaxis failures. 
Among the 11 cases, six patients were nonadherent with their 
malaria chemoprophylaxis regimen, and two patients did not 
provide adherence information. The remaining three patients 
reported adherence with an antimalarial chemoprophylaxis 
regimen. Two patients who reported adherence to the 
chemoprophylaxis regimen had traveled to Africa; one took 
only atovaquone/proguanil for malaria chemoprophylaxis and 
the other reported taking mefloquine and doxycycline. The 
other patient traveled to Papua New Guinea for tourism and 
reported taking doxycycline. Possible explanations for infection 
in these patients include inappropriate dosing, unreported 
nonadherence, malabsorption of the drug, an early relapse 
from hypnozoites established at the start of the trip, or possibly 
emerging parasite resistance.
Cases of P
. falciparum or P
. malariae After Recommended 
Prophylaxis Use. The 162 cases of malaria reported among 
persons who took a recommended antimalarial drug for 
chemoprophylaxis included 116 cases of P
. falciparum, five cases 
of P
. malariae, and five cases with mixed infection. Of the 116 
P
. falciparum cases, 113 (97%) were acquired in Africa, one 
(1%) in Haiti, and two (2%) in Guyana. Seventy-eight (67%) 
of the 116 P
. falciparum patients reported nonadherence to 
the antimalarial drug regimen, 23 (20%) patients reported 
adherence, and 15 patients had no adherence information 
available. Of the 23 cases in which patients reported adherence 
with antimalarial chemoprophylaxis, one traveled to Guyana 
and took mefloquine for malaria chemoprophylaxis and 22 
had traveled to Africa. Of those who traveled to Africa, eight 
patients took atovaquone/proguanil, eight took mefloquine, five 
took doxycycline, and one reported taking both atovaquone/
proguanil and artemether/lumefantrine. Of the five P
. malariae 
cases, only one reported adherence to the antimalarial 
drug regimen; the patient traveled to Guinea and reported 
taking mefloquine.
Patients with a Recent History of Malaria
Of the 1,720 imported cases, data on history of malaria was 
known for 1,083 (63%) cases; 225 (21%) patients reported a 
history of malaria infection during the preceding 12 months. 
Among the 225 cases, 107 were P
. falciparum (48%), 51 (23%) 
were P
. vivax, 20 (9%) were P
. ovale, six (3%) were P
. malariae, 
six (3%) were mixed infections, and 35 (16%) reported no 
species. A total of eight probable relapses were identified on

the basis of onset date, date of previous infection, and previous 
infection species: six P
. vivax cases and two P

Among the eight relapses, only three patients (two were P
. vivax 
infections and one was a P
. ovale infection) subsequently received 
primaquine as part of treatment to avoid future relapses.
Purpose of Travel
Purpose of travel to regions in which malaria is endemic 
was reported for 904 (81%) of the 1,122 U.S. civilians with 
imported malaria (Table 6). Of the 904 who reported purpose 
of travel, 635 (70%) were VFRs, 69 (8%) were missionaries, 
and 92 (10%) were traveling for business. The proportion 
of VFRs among 1,122 U.S. civilians with imported malaria 
increased (66% in 2012 versus 70% in 2013), and the 
proportion of military travelers decreased (4% in 2012 versus 
1% in 2013).
Malaria by Age
Among the 1,720 imported malaria cases among patients for 
whom age was known, 291 (17%) occurred in persons aged 
<18 years, 1,325 (77%) in persons aged 18–64 years, and 104 
(6%) in persons aged ≥65 years. Although the majority of cases 
occurred in persons aged 18–64 years, pediatric cases are of 
particular interest because the preventive care of most children 
is determined by parents or guardians. Among the 291 cases 
among persons aged <18 years, 166 (57%) occurred among 
U.S. civilian children, 101 (35%) occurred among children 
of persons categorized as having a foreign resident status at 
the time their malaria infection was acquired, and 24 (8%) 
occurred among children of unknown resident status. Of the 
166 cases among U.S. civilian children, nine (5%) were aged 
<2 years, 30 (18%) were aged 2–4 years, 68 (41%) were aged 
5–12 years, and 59 (36%) were aged 13–17 years. A total 
of 140 (88%) of the cases among 159 U.S. civilian children 
for whom country of exposure was known were attributable 
to travel to Africa. Among the 137 U.S. civilian children for 
whom reason for travel was known, 113 (82%) were VFRs, 
11 (8%) were traveling for educational purposes, eight (6%) 
were traveling for missionary work, four (3%) were traveling for 
tourism, and one (1%) accompanied their parent/guardian on a 
business trip. Of the 151 children for whom chemoprophylaxis 
information was known, 64 (42%) were reported as having 
taken chemoprophylaxis, of whom 27 (42%) had taken an 
appropriate regimen; however, only 11 (41%) of these 27 
patients reported adherence.
Hospitalization
Information on hospitalization was reported for 1,450 (84%) 
cases. Among those persons, 1,003 (69%) were hospitalized. 
The majority of those cases were P
. falciparum (n = 710 [71%]), 
of which 213 (30%) were considered severe. This represents 
a significant increase in the number of severe cases of 
P
. falciparum who were hospitalized (160 in 2012 versus 213 in 
2013). The second largest proportion of hospitalized cases were 
P
. vivax (n = 124 [12%]). The majority of hospitalized P
. vivax 
patients had uncomplicated malaria infections; however, seven 
(6%) were severe.
Treatment in Uncomplicated Imported 
Malaria Cases
Of the 1,450 imported cases of uncomplicated malaria in 
2013, information on treatment medicines was available for 
1,031 (71%) persons. This represents a significant decrease 
in the number of cases with available treatment information 
(77% in 2012 versus 71% in 2013). Of these, 643 (62%) 
were P
. falciparum, 172 (17%) P
. vivax, 48 (5%) P
. ovale, 25 
(2%) P
. malariae, 27 (3%) mixed cases, and 116 (11%) were 
a species type that was unknown or not reported. The CDC 
Guidelines for Treatment of Malaria in the United States, herein 
referred to as the CDC Guidelines for Treatment, was used 
to determine whether the medicines listed for treatment were 
appropriate (28).
Of the 1,031 patients with uncomplicated malaria with 
available information on treatment, 868 (84%) were treated 
appropriately according to the CDC Guidelines for Treatment, 
and 163 (16%) patients received inappropriate treatment. The 
percent of patients with uncomplicated disease who were treated 
appropriately was unchanged from 2012. Among the patients 
who were treated appropriately, 114 (13%) indicated taking 
other antimalarial drugs in addition to those recommended 
by CDC guidelines. Because the CDC surveillance report 
form does not record the sequence of treatment events, it is 
difficult to understand and characterize the intended purpose 
of additional antimalarial treatment drugs. Therefore, for the 
purpose of this report, these 114 patients were considered to be 
treated appropriately. Among the 163 inappropriately treated 
patients, 13 (8%) had received a recommended antimalarial 
for chemoprophylaxis but subsequently had inappropriately 
received the same drug for treatment. Antimalarial drugs 
used for treatment should differ from the drugs received for 
chemoprophylaxis because of the potential for toxicity and 
reduced efficacy.
Adequacy of treatment varied by species. For the 
643 P
. falciparum cases, 551 (86%) patients were treated 
appropriately, according to the CDC Guidelines for Treatment, 
of which 85 (15%) received additional antimalarial drugs. The 
92 P
. falciparum cases that were treated with an inappropriate 
treatment regimen included four pregnant patients. Among 
the 25 P
. malariae cases, 22 (88%) patients were treated 
appropriately according to the CDC Guidelines for Treatment,

eight mixed cases that were not treated appropriately, six included 
at least one relapsing species and only two received primaquine.
According to the CDC Guidelines for Treatment, when 
species is unknown, a treatment regimen for a P
. falciparum 
infection should be used to treat infection. Among the 116 
cases where species was unknown, 87 (75%) patients were

treated appropriately according to the CDC Guidelines for 
Treatment, of whom 11 (13%) received other antimalarial 
drugs, in addition to those recommended by CDC. Twenty-
nine (25%) patients received an inappropriate treatment 
regimen. Incomplete reporting of species and treatment 
medications might affect whether the case is classified as having 
been treated appropriately or not.
Severe Malaria
Among the 1,727 reported cases, 270 (16%) were classified as 
severe malaria, including 10 cases in which patients died. Most 
(199 [74%]) severe cases occurred in persons aged ≥18 years, 
and 70 (26%) occurred in children aged <18 years, 13 (19%) of 
whom were aged <3 years. Age was not reported for one (<1%) 
patient. Persons aged <5 years were significantly more likely to 
have severe disease when compared with those ≥5 years (37% 
of those <5 years versus 15% of those ≥5 years). No association 
was found between severe disease and resident status. Among 
the 260 cases in patients with known resident status, 201 
(77%) were U.S. residents. The predominant species among 
the severe cases was P
. falciparum (n = 233 [86%]), which was 
significantly higher than 2012 (n = 174 [75%]).
Where information on prophylaxis was known 
(n = 230), 47 (20%) persons reported taking a recommended 
chemoprophylaxis; however, only 11 reported adherence 
to the drug regimen, including five who took doxycycline, 
three who used mefloquine, and three who took atovaquone/
proguanil. One of the three persons who reported taking 
atovaquone/proguanil also reported taking artemether/
lumefantrine. Patients with severe cases were less likely to have 
taken prophylaxis than those with uncomplicated cases (20% 
versus 30%). Although some patients had multiple clinical 
complications associated with their infection, the largest 
proportion of patients experienced renal failure (18%), followed 
by severe anemia (Hb <7g/dL) (16%), cerebral malaria (11%), 
ARDS (9%), and jaundice (5%). Patients with severe disease 
were more likely to receive inappropriate treatment than those 
with uncomplicated disease. Among the 270 severe cases, 149

(55%) patients were treated with quinidine 
and 81 (30%) were treated with an oral 
antimalarial drug. Forty-three (16%) patients 
were treated with intravenous (IV) artesunate 
provided by CDC through an investigational 
new drug (IND) protocol. Patients diagnosed 
with uncomplicated malaria can be effectively 
treated with oral antimalarial drugs. However, 
patients who are considered to have severe 
disease should be treated aggressively with 
parenteral antimalarial therapy (28).
No significant difference was observed in 
the number of days from date of arrival in the 
United States to the date of hospitalization 
between severe and uncomplicated 
P
. falciparum cases (17.0 days for severe and 
12.7 days for uncomplicated). In addition, 
no significant difference was observed in the 
length of time between date of onset of illness 
and date of hospitalization between severe and 
uncomplicated P
. falciparum cases (6.5 days for 
severe and 5.8 days for uncomplicated). The dates on which 
patients first saw a medical provider were not collected, so 
time from first provider encounter to hospitalization could 
not be examined.
No association existed between the reason for travel and 
severe malaria. Among patients for whom reason for travel 
was known, most (63%) of the severe cases were in VFRs 
(comparable with 2011), of whom 74% specified acquisition 
from West Africa; 89% of severe cases were identified as 
P
. falciparum infections. Three (1%) of the severe cases were 
acquired in Haiti, significantly below 2011 levels when 5% 
of the severe cases were acquired in Haiti. In Haiti, virtually 
all malaria is caused by P
. falciparum.
Malaria During Pregnancy
A total of 36 cases of malaria were reported among pregnant 
women in 2013, representing 6% of cases among all women 
(n = 639). The number of pregnant women with malaria did 
not change significantly from the 34 cases reported in 2012. In 
addition, no significant differences were noted among pregnant 
women with malaria compared with nonpregnant women, in 
terms of species type, reason for travel, or region of infection 
acquisition. Of the 36 cases among pregnant women, eight 
(22%) cases were severe, all of whom were hospitalized and 
survived. Among the 29 cases for whom Plasmodium species 
type was known, 22 (76%) were diagnosed with P
. falciparum 
infection, including the eight patients who presented with 
severe malaria. Two (7%) were diagnosed with P
. vivax, two 
with P
. malariae, one with P
. ovale, two with mixed infections,

and seven (19%) with no species reported. Twenty-two of the 
36 (61%) cases occurred among pregnant women who were 
U.S. civilians; most of whom (91%) reported travel to Africa. 
Among the 15 U.S. civilian pregnant women with known 
reason for travel, 93% were VFRs. Of the 22 cases of malaria 
reported among U.S. civilian pregnant women, seven (32%) 
reported taking malaria chemoprophylaxis. None of the seven 
women reported adhering to their chemoprophylaxis. No 
information was available on birth outcomes.
Drug Resistance Markers
In 2013, a total of 137 blood samples were sent to CDC 
and tested for genetic markers associated with resistance to 
antimalarial drugs. Because the current focus for drug resistance 
is for P
. falciparum, CDC first determines the species by PCR. 
All other species are archived for future testing. Twenty-nine 
state and local health departments submitted samples for 
testing. Species of malaria parasite was confirmed by PCR to 
be P
. falciparum in 100 (73%) samples, followed by P
. vivax 
(15 [11%]), P
. ovale (14 [10%]), P
. malariae (six [4%]), and 
mixed infections (two [1%]). PCR determined or corrected 
the species for 85 samples (62%) submitted (Table 7). Of 
the P
. falciparum-positive samples with results, 88 (93%) had 
genetic polymorphisms associated with pyrimethamine drug 
resistance, 74 (76%) with sulfadoxine resistance (37 with one, 
22 with two, and 15 with three or more resistance markers), 
53 (53%) with chloroquine resistance, none with mefloquine 
resistance, one (1%) with atovaquone resistance, and none with 
artemisinin resistance (Table 8). Of the P
. falciparum-positive 
patients that reported location of recent travel, most reported 
recent travel to Africa. In addition, one case of atovaquone/
proguanil resistance was detected in a U.S. worker returning 
from Nigeria in whom resistance developed during treatment 
and genetic testing confirmed the presence of resistance 
markers (29). Another case was described in 2012 (24).
Selected Malaria Case Reports
Congenital Cases
Two congenital cases caused by transmission of parasites from 
mother to child during pregnancy or during labor and delivery 
were reported in 2013. Clinical and laboratory data are limited.
Case 1. In June, a male term infant aged 3 weeks developed 
a fever of 102°F (38°C), rigors, and overall fussiness. He was 
seen in the hospital where P
. vivax was diagnosed by smear 
microscopy and RDT. His mother had immigrated to the 
United States from Ethiopia 6 months earlier and reported 
having been diagnosed with and treated for malaria with 
unspecified medication when she was 2 months pregnant. She 
also reported having a fever 1 week before delivery that resolved 
without treatment. The baby was treated with chloroquine. The 
hospital staff indicated their intention to test the mother for 
G6PD deficiency and, if negative, treat her with primaquine. 
The baby had no clinical complications and recovered fully.
Case 2. In July, a male infant of unknown gestation, aged 
1 day, had P
. falciparum diagnosed with a parasitemia of 0.1%. 
The same day, his mother also had P
. falciparum diagnosed 
with a 2% parasitemia. She had come to the United States 
from Nigeria 1 week before delivery. The mother was initially 
treated with atovaquone/proguanil, but her doctor switched 
her to quinine and clindamycin to complete treatment. The 
infant was treated with atovaquone/proguanil. Both mother 
and infant had no clinical complications and recovered fully.

Fatal Cases
Case 1. In June, a man aged 64 years returned to the 
United States after a 10-day trip to Ghana. He had not used 
chemoprophylaxis while in Ghana. He developed a fever 1 week 
after returning to the United States but did not seek care for 
3 more days. On July 5, when he sought medical care, he was 
empirically treated for fever with doxycycline and azithromycin. 
The following day he developed confusion and focal neurologic 
deficits. Soon after arrival at the hospital on July 6 (4 days after 
symptom onset), he became comatose and was intubated and 
placed on mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit 
(ICU). P
. falciparum malaria was diagnosed by microscopy and 
RDT on the evening of July 6, but parasitemia was not initially 
calculated; he was prescribed oral quinine and IV doxycycline. 
A CT showed evidence of severe cerebral edema and impending 
brainstem herniation. The following morning, his thin blood film 
revealed a 50% parasitemia. CDC was contacted and artesunate 
was provided under the IND protocol. The patient received three 
IV doses of artesunate starting on July 7. A subsequent malaria 
blood film was obtained; which noted that malarial parasites were 
present, but the parasitemia was not quantified. On the second 
day of his hospitalization, a nuclear medicine scan revealed no 
cerebral circulation and an EEG showed no cortical activity. The 
decision was made to withdraw support, and he died on July 8.
Case 2. In late April, a man aged 75 years returned from 
a 3-month visit to Ghana to see family and friends. He was 
originally from Ghana but had been a resident of the United States 
for many years. He had a medical history of atrial fibrillation, 
hypertensive heart disease, and hypercholesterolemia. He 
reported taking mefloquine for prophylaxis, but it was not 
known whether he was adherent. Approximately 2 months after 
returning to the United States, he reported onset of fatigue. Two 
weeks later he developed a subjective fever. Three days later, he 
went to the emergency department, where he was found to have 
a fever of 102°F (38°C), mild anemia, and thrombocytopenia. 
The following day, P
. falciparum was diagnosed by microscopy 
with 4.7% parasitemia. He was immediately started on 
IV quinidine and doxycycline in the ICU. His parasitemia 
dropped to 1.8% by the second day of his hospitalization and 
steadily declined until no further parasites were visualized by 
microscopy on day 8. On hospital day 6, he developed right 
upper lobe pneumonia and respiratory distress, necessitating 
intubation with mechanical ventilation. His respiratory status 
never improved and was complicated by worsening heart and 
then renal failure. He died of these nosocomial complications 
(pneumonia, renal failure, and heart failure) 6 weeks after 
admission to the hospital.
Case 3. In January, a man aged 51 years returned to the 
United States after a 7-week business trip to Liberia, where 
he did not take malaria chemoprophylaxis. He developed a 
fever 4 days after return to the United States but did not seek 
medical attention. Six days after his onset of fever, he was 
found to have an altered mental status and was taken to an 
emergency department, where he was diagnosed with cerebral 
malaria by microscopy (P
. falciparum 15% parasitemia), 
along with jaundice and severe acidosis. He was started on 
IV quinidine gluconate and IV doxycycline. In ICU, he 
developed quinidine-induced QTc interval prolongation 
and was switched to artesunate under the CDC IND 
protocol. His parasitemia decreased to 3% on day 2 of 
hospitalization. However, he remained severely acidotic with 
significant electrolyte abnormalities refractory to dialysis and 
IV bicarbonate. On February 6, he developed cardiac arrest, 
and resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful.
Case 4. In April, a man aged 37 years returned to the United 
States following a 3-week trip to Sierra Leone to visit friends 
and relatives. He had not taken malaria chemoprophylaxis. 
Five days after returning, he developed fatigue, malaise, and 
vomiting. He presented to an urgent care center, where he 
was found to have thrombocytopenia and leucopenia. He was 
referred to a hematologist but no appointment was made. His 
symptoms worsened over the next few days and he experienced 
changes in his mental status. On April 14, he was transported 
to the hospital by ambulance. He was unresponsive in the 
emergency department. After arrival, he had a seizure and 
was admitted to the ICU and intubated. A blood film was 
positive for infection with P
. falciparum. His peak parasitemia 
was 31%. He was started on IV doxycycline and IV quinidine. 
He developed refractory hypotension and was switched to 
IV artesunate. He developed renal failure with lactic acidosis, 
severe cerebral edema, and a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A head 
CT 6 days after admission demonstrated cerebral herniation. 
Additional studies demonstrated no cerebral blood flow and 
no brain activity. He was declared brain dead, support was 
withdrawn, and he died on April 22.

Case 5. In late November, a man aged 65 years returned to 
the United States following a 3-week trip to Liberia, where 
he had visited friends and relatives. He had a history of 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal insufficiency. 
He had not taken any malaria chemoprophylaxis while on 
his trip. He began experiencing chills when his return flight 
was landing and sought medical attention the following day. 
A diagnosis of malaria was not considered, and he was sent 
home with a prescription for doxycycline, which he did not 
take. His symptoms progressed, and he returned to the hospital 
the following day by ambulance. He was hypotensive with 
lactic acidosis and in acute renal failure. A blood film revealed 
infection with P
. falciparum with a 39% parasitemia. He was 
started on IV quinidine and IV doxycycline. He responded 
well to treatment and his parasitemia dropped to 1%, but 
he remained in renal failure with acidosis. On the third day 
of hospitalization, he developed cardiac arrest. Resuscitation 
attempts were not successful, and he died on December 3.
Case 6. On August 5, a man aged 44 years returned to 
the United States after a 3-month business trip to Equatorial 
Guinea. He reported having malaria diagnosed three times 
while there, which he described as a mild cold. He also reported 
being started on atovaquone/proguanil chemoprophylaxis 
after one episode of malaria. He ran out of the medication 
just as he was leaving the country. He had onset of illness the 
day he returned and sought medical care on August 7. The 
physicians immediately suspected severe malaria and started 
empiric IV quinidine and IV doxycycline within 2 hours of his 
arrival in the emergency department. Initial laboratory findings 
indicated that he was acidotic and microscopy showed that 
he was infected with P
. falciparum with an 18% parasitemia. 
Beginning the next morning, he developed rapidly progressive 
ARDS, renal failure, and refractory acidosis. He was intubated 
and required vasopressors for hypotension. His parasitemia had 
fallen to 6.5% after 24 hours of quinidine. On hospital day 3, 
he had a seizure and EEG indicated no cerebral activity. On 
August 9, he developed cardiac arrest and resuscitation was 
not successful.
Case 7. In early December, a man aged 55 years returned 
to the United States from a trip to Liberia to visit friends and 
relatives. A week later, he was found at home unresponsive 
and taken to the emergency department by ambulance. He 
had a history of untreated hypertension and diabetes and 
had apparently been feeling ill (with unspecified symptoms) 
for the week before admission. In the emergency department 
on December 9, he was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis,

hypotensive, febrile, and in renal failure. He was found to have 
E. coli bacteremia and treated with antibiotics, insulin, fluids, 
and vasopressors. On December 10, he also had P
. falciparum 
diagnosed with a 0.6% parasitemia. Quinidine was initially 
unavailable and CDC was contacted for artesunate, which 
was sent. A supply of quinidine was found from a neighboring 
hospital 30 minutes later and started on December 10 at 
5:30 a.m. Once the artesunate arrived on December 10 at 
9:15 a.m., he was switched to IV artesunate. During the 
hospitalization, he developed gastrointestinal bleeding and 
remained hypotensive and progressively more acidotic, 
despite dialysis and repeated blood transfusions. Exploratory 
laparotomy revealed extensive necrotic bowel. This condition 
was deemed nonsurvivable, support was removed, and he died 
on December 12.
Case 8. In June, a man aged 33 years returned to the United 
States from a 5-week business trip to Liberia. He did not take 
any malaria chemoprophylaxis for fear of side effects. Two 
weeks after returning, he developed a fever. He sought medical 
care 3 days later. Malaria was diagnosed by microscopy in the 
emergency department, and he was given chloroquine and 
admitted to the hospital. The following morning, chloroquine 
was determined to be inappropriate because his infection was 
acquired in West Africa, and he was switched to atovaquone/
proguanil. Later that day, the species was identified as 
P
. falciparum with 30% parasitemia. Treatment was switched 
to IV quinidine and IV doxycycline and he was transferred 
to the ICU. On day 3 of hospitalization, he developed severe 
acute hemolytic anemia and renal failure. The following day he 
developed lactic acidosis and began having difficulty breathing; 
he was intubated and given an exchange transfusion. He was 
switched to IV artesunate, started on extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation (ECMO), and transferred to another hospital. 
On hospital day 9, his respiratory function had improved 
and he was removed from ECMO. Immediately after the 
procedure, he had fixed and dilated pupils. A head CT revealed 
a massive cerebral hemorrhage; a craniotomy and clot excision 
were performed. The following day it was determined to be 
medically futile and life support measures were withdrawn. 
He died on hospital day 10.
Case 9. In July, a man aged 59 years from Sudan returned 
to the United States after a 3-month trip to Sudan to visit 
friends and relatives. On arrival into the United States, he 
experienced chills, sweats, and weakness; he did not seek 
medical attention. Approximately 3 weeks later on July 31, 
a family member found him at home confused and he was 
taken to the emergency department. He was diagnosed with 
severe malaria (parasitemia of 19%), renal failure, lactic 
acidosis, pancreatitis, and liver failure with severe jaundice. 
He was initially started on IV quinidine but developed 
QT-prolongation and supraventricular arrhythmias. CDC 
was contacted and artesunate was provided. His parasitemia 
dropped in response to the IV artesunate. During his 
hospitalization, he was also diagnosed with E. coli bacteremia, 
hepatitis C, and a pulmonary hemorrhage from a previously 
undiagnosed mass in his chest. He remained intubated and 
mechanically ventilated and on vasopressor support throughout 
his hospitalization. His liver failure, jaundice, blood pressure, 
and respiratory status continued to worsen despite maximal 
support. His family decided to forego further interventions, 
and he died on August 11.
Case 10. In July, a woman aged 34 years from the Republic 
of the Congo traveled to the United States for a family vacation. 
She began experiencing influenza-like symptoms 2 days before 
coming to the United States, but she did not seek care until 
2 days after arriving. She went to the emergency department 
on July 16 where she was found to be thrombocytopenic, 
hypotensive, and tachycardic. A malaria blood film indicated 
she had severe P
. falciparum infection with a 25% parasitemia. 
She was admitted to the ICU and started on IV quinidine 
and IV doxycycline. CDC was contacted and artesunate was 
provided in case she developed worsening hypotension on 
quinidine. The following day, she appeared to be improving 
with resolution of her hypotension and a parasitemia of 20%. 
That afternoon, she had a generalized seizure and became 
comatose. A head CT revealed brainstem herniation. The 
treating physicians switched her to IV artesunate. She remained 
comatose and was declared brain dead. She died on July 28.
Discussion
In 2013, a total of 1,727 malaria cases were reported in the 
United States, the third highest number recorded since 1970 
and 10% lower than the highest number reported in 2011 
during the preceding 40 years (25). An increasing trend in 
the number of cases has been observed since the early 1970s 
following the end of the Vietnam War. This pattern appears 
to be similar to that being reported in other parts of the 
world. For example, in the United Kingdom, the number 
of imported cases has increased substantially since the 1970s 
(30). In addition, in 2012, a total of 1,501 malaria cases were 
reported in the United Kingdom, a 9% increase from 2012 
(n = 1,378) (31). The majority of the U.S. cases were acquired 
in sub-Saharan Africa, which is also similar to the data reported 
by the United Kingdom. Despite progress in reducing the 
number of malaria cases in regions where malaria is endemic 
(2), international travel appears to be growing steadily and 
use of appropriate prevention measures by travelers is still 
inadequate. The World Tourism Organization reported a total 
 Surveillance Summaries
MMWR / March 4, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 2

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
of 1.087 billion international travelers in 2013, with notable 
increases in overall travel (5%), travel to Asia and the Pacific 
(6%), and travel to Africa (6%) (26). Travel to North Africa 
continued to increase following declines that were a result 
of the Arab Spring and political transitions in North Africa 
in 2011. From 2012 to 2013, travel to Sub-Saharan Africa 
increased 5% (26).
International travelers are a heterogeneous group with 
different reasons for travel, levels of education, and potential 
barriers for chemoprophylaxis use. They represent both 
short-stay (e.g., air crew) and long-term travelers (e.g., Peace 
Corps volunteers, tourists, missionaries, disaster and relief 
workers, and military personnel) (32–35). In addition, 
reasons travelers do not use malaria chemoprophylaxis vary, 
including lack of awareness of their risks for malaria and the 
potential severity of the disease (32–35) and concerns about 
side effects of medications (35). As a result, interventions to 
improve chemoprophylaxis require a multifaceted approach. 
Health care providers need to tailor interventions to their 
particular populations to increase awareness, understanding, 
or acceptance of malaria chemoprophylaxis (36).
As international travel increases, prevention messages and 
health communication strategies become even more important 
for protecting the traveling community from communicable 
diseases. Prevention messages directed toward Africa-bound 
travelers, particularly those whose destination is West Africa, 
should be emphasized in early spring, accompanied with a 
reminder in late fall through early winter. Malaria prevention 
messages directed toward Asia-bound travelers, specifically 
those bound for India, should be intensified in late spring. 
Travelers should be informed of the risk for malaria and 
strongly encouraged to use protective measures, including 
chemoprophylaxis. Imported malaria can reintroduce malaria 
into regions, including the United States, where the disease is 
not endemic and environmental conditions are present that 
can support the lifecycle of the parasite, including the presence 
of a competent Anopheles vector.
Of the 1,720 imported cases, 242 (14%) reports did not 
provide information regarding U.S. resident status, 203 (12%) 
did not have information regarding travel history, and 286 
(17%) did not have information on species. The percentage of 
cases with incomplete data elements did not change in 2013 
compared with 2012, and it still remains unacceptably high. 
For most of the cases with missing residential status, travel 
history, and species, reporting to CDC was done electronically 
to NNDSS and not by the NMSS case report form. NNDSS is 
unable to receive malaria-specific data elements from state and 
local health departments. States and local health departments 
are strongly encouraged to report cases using the NMSS 
case report form until malaria-specific data can be received 
electronically by NNDSS. Importation status could not be 
determined for five cases because of lack of information. 
CDC provided diagnostic assistance with these five cases, 
but they were never reported to CDC by state/local health 
departments. Follow-up efforts did not yield the additional 
information necessary to classify them. Because incomplete 
reporting compromises efforts to examine trends in malaria 
cases in the United States and prevent infections among 
travelers, all elements on the NMSS case report form should 
be completed. Local and state health departments, health care 
providers, and other health personnel should be vigilant in 
reporting complete information for malaria cases. Specifically, 
if certain variables are not reported (e.g., species, residence, 
and country of acquisition), efforts should be made to obtain 
complete information for comprehensive analysis. Beginning 
in 2014, CSTE released a revised case definition for malaria 
highlighting the importance of determining the species and 
parasitemia at the time of diagnosis and strongly encouraging 
PCR testing for each case (37).
In the Caribbean region, endemic transmission of malaria 
ended in the mid-1960s, except on the island of Hispaniola, 
which includes the countries of the Dominican Republic 
and Haiti (38). An increase in the numbers of malaria cases 
acquired in Haiti had already been noted before the January 
2010 earthquake (13). This increase continued throughout 
2010 and was likely the result of both increased transmission 
in Haiti and increased volume of travel between the United 
States and Haiti by relief aid workers and Haitians returning 
to visit friends and relatives (23,39,40). The number of cases 
reported decreased from 172 in 2010 to 22 in 2013. Despite 
this significant decrease, the number of cases acquired in Haiti 
in 2013 is similar to the number acquired there before the 2010 
earthquake (39). Of the 22 cases that were acquired in Haiti, 
only one patient reported taking prophylaxis. That patient 
reported taking chloroquine and mefloquine for prophylaxis, 
but it was not reported whether he had taken all of it. Failure 
to take chemoprophylaxis is the most common risk factor for 
acquisition of malaria among travelers to regions where the 
disease is endemic. Messages must be conveyed to VFR travelers 
that they are at substantial risk for malaria, despite beliefs 
that partial immunity offers protection from disease (41). 
Recent reports of emerging molecular markers of chloroquine 
drug resistance in Haiti (42,43) indicate a need for increased 
vigilance for evidence of clinical chloroquine chemoprophylaxis 
or treatment failure. However, chloroquine remains an 
effective choice for chemoprophylaxis and treatment of malaria 
acquired in Haiti. Health care providers should contact CDC 
to assist with the evaluation of possible chloroquine failures 
identified among U.S. travelers or Haitian immigrants to the 
United States. Efforts are underway to eliminate malaria from 
 Surveillance Summaries

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Central America and the Caribbean region by 2020; as a result, 
the number of cases from Haiti is expected to decrease over 
the next decade (44).
In 2013, one case of malaria was diagnosed in the 
United States in a traveler from Greece. Malaria was officially 
eliminated from Greece in 1974 (45,46). Since then, an average 
of 50 cases per year have been reported annually, the majority of 
which were imported from countries where malaria is endemic 
(45). In 2009, seven cases of malaria were diagnosed in Greece 
without a report of travel (47). That number increased to a 
high of 42 in 2011 (48). In response to these cases, the Hellenic 
Center for Disease Control and Prevention developed an action 
plan that included enhanced surveillance for malaria, updated 
treatment plans that included administration of antimalarials to 
immigrants from countries where malaria is endemic, provider 
and public education, and enhanced vector-control activities 
(48). The outbreak in Greece underscores the importance of 
investigating cases of malaria diagnosed in the United States, 
where no recent travel is indicated because of the potential for 
reintroduction of active transmission of malaria.
In 2013, a total of 14 cases were reported among military 
personnel, a 67% (n = 43) decrease from 2012, representing 
the lowest number of cases since 2003 (49). Approximately 
one third of the 2013 cases among military personnel were 
acquired in Afghanistan. Adherence among those military 
personnel who reported taking any chemoprophylaxis was 
22% in 2012 and was 17% in 2013.This is substantially lower 
than the reported adherence by U.S. service members overall 
(range: 49%–100%) (50,51). Reasons for these differences 
might include overreporting of adherence among the survey 
respondents and missing information on chemoprophylaxis 
adherence reported to NMSS or AFHSC. Before 2010, 
cases among patients who were traveling for military duty 
to regions where malaria is endemic were only reported to 
CDC by local and state health departments and private health 
clinicians. However, since CDC partnered with AFHSC in 
2010, additional cases occurring among the military are being 
identified that might have not been identified previously 
by local or state health departments or private health care 
providers, thus improving opportunities to monitor and 
survey trends or changes (e.g., in geographical transmission 
and prophylaxis or treatment failures among the deployed 
military population).
Of the 186 uncomplicated cases of P
. vivax or P
. ovale in 
men and in women who were not pregnant at the time of 
diagnosis (primaquine is contraindicated during pregnancy), 
only 75 (40%) received primaquine, the only antimalarial 
active against the dormant parasite liver forms and prevents 
relapses (52). In addition to their treatment for acute malaria, 
all persons who have mosquito-acquired P
. vivax and P
. ovale 
diagnosed and who are not G6PD deficient should receive a 
course of primaquine for relapse prevention (28). In 2011, 
the Food and Drug Administration reported that primaquine 
was back ordered because of manufacturing issues reported by 
Sanofi-Aventis, the only pharmaceutical company producing 
primaquine in the United States (53). Providers were urged to 
keep patients on weekly chloroquine prophylaxis to prevent 
relapses (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/new_info/2011/
primaquine.html). Only 28 (21%) of P
. vivax and P
. ovale 
patients who did not receive primaquine received chloroquine. 
Because the CDC surveillance report form does not record 
the dates of treatment, understanding and determining the 
intended purpose of chloroquine treatment in these cases is 
difficult. Primaquine became available again in late 2012 (54).
This report includes the second year of results of the 
molecular surveillance to assess the prevalence of antimalarial 
drug resistance markers. In 2013, CDC received 137 
specimens from 29 state and local health departments. The 
prevalence of resistance markers varied for different drugs 
such as pyrimethamine, sulfadoxine, chloroquine, mefloquine, 
and atovaquone. No markers associated with resistance to 
artemisinin derivatives were identified. In many places around 
the world, malaria parasites have become resistant to the 
antimalarial drugs used to treat cases of malaria illness, and 
it is important to identify and track those resistance patterns. 
As CDC receives and tests more samples, it will be able 
to identify these evolving changes in resistance patterns in 
different countries; many countries do not conduct molecular 
surveillance and report it to publicly available databases. 
These data will help to formulate prevention and treatment 
recommendations for those traveling from the United States 
to areas where malaria is endemic and to determine country 
of acquisition for cases with no reported travel information. 
All cases of malaria diagnosed in the United States should be 
evaluated for drug resistance markers. This testing is available 
for all cases of malaria diagnosed in the United States and 
is conducted at CDC free of charge. CDC encourages all 
laboratories in the United States to use this service for all of 
the cases of malaria that they diagnose (http://www.cdc.gov/
malaria/features/ars.html). Pretreatment blood collected for 
initial diagnostic tests (e.g., complete blood count) can be 
saved and sent to CDC for the drug resistance marker tests.
Ten fatal cases were reported in 2013, the highest number 
since 2001 (55). The fatalities were all from P
. falciparum 
infections. One patient delayed seeking treatment after onset 
of symptoms, one was initially treated with oral antimalarials 
despite having a hyperparasitemia (≥5%), and one was 
discharged with empiric antibiotics without a recommended 
workup for fever in a traveler returning from an area where 
malaria is endemic. To facilitate a prompt diagnosis, providers

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
also should include malaria in the differential diagnosis of 
fever in a person who has returned from travel to a malarious 
area. Signs and symptoms of malaria often are nonspecific but 
typically include fever. Other symptoms include headache, 
chills, increased sweating, back pain, myalgia, diarrhea, 
nausea, vomiting, and cough. Health care providers should 
ask all febrile patients for a travel history. Any delay in the 
diagnosis and treatment of malaria can result in complications, 
regardless of the effectiveness of the treatment regimen. 
Patients suspected of having malaria infection should be 
evaluated through microscopic examination of thick and thin 
blood films, adhering to Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration bloodborne pathogens standard (56). As a 
result of fear expressed during the Ebola outbreak in West 
Africa that began in 2014, CDC developed additional steps to 
inactivate viruses, including Ebola, during the slide preparation 
process (14). Thick blood films are more sensitive in detecting 
malaria parasites because the blood is more concentrated, which 
allows for a greater volume of blood to be examined. Thin 
films aid in parasite species identification and quantification 
(57). Blood films should be read immediately; off-hours, 
qualified personnel who can perform this function should 
be on-call. Laboratories unable to provide immediate blood 
film microscopy should maintain a supply of malaria antigen 
detection kits to assist with the initial diagnosis of malaria, 
which can subsequently be confirmed by microscopy or PCR.
The choice of a specific antimalarial treatment regimen 
should be made on the basis of several factors, including the 
probable geographic origin of the parasite, the Plasmodium 
species, parasite density, and the patient’s clinical status (58). 
A 2010 nationwide survey of laboratories in the United States 
indicated that most laboratories offered malaria diagnostic 
testing services but very few were in complete compliance 
with all of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 
guidelines for analysis and reporting of results (59). In addition, 
most laboratories reported very few cases annually (58). The 
case definition used in 2014 for malaria surveillance in the 
United States has been revised to include identification of 
malaria parasites, determination of species, and quantification 
of the parasitemia (37). Microscopy is still considered the best 
method for the immediate diagnosis of malaria; however, PCR 
testing is particularly valuable for species confirmation and 
should be used to confirm the results of microscopy and to 
evaluate for mixed infections. CDC’s Parasitology Diagnostic 
Service team provides no-cost diagnostic services to laboratories 
and health professionals diagnosing cases of malaria, including 
microscopy, PCR testing and drug resistance marker testing. 
Of the 1,727 cases, species confirmation was provided by CDC 
for 104 (6%) cases. A total of 137 specimens were submitted 
to CDC for drug resistance marker testing in 2013; for 
approximately half of those specimens, PCR testing identified 
or corrected the species. Increasing the proportion of cases with 
diagnosis confirmation and drug resistance marker testing will 
improve the understanding epidemiology of malaria diagnosed 
in the United States.
Patients with suspected or confirmed malaria who are severely 
ill should be treated aggressively with parenteral antimalarial 
therapy. Quinidine gluconate continues to be recommended 
for parenteral malaria therapy. However, this medication is 
no longer available in many hospital formularies. Because 
parenteral quinidine gluconate is potentially cardiotoxic, 
it should be administered in an intensive care setting with 
continuous cardiac and frequent blood pressure monitoring. 
As an alternative to quinidine gluconate, IV artesunate is 
also highly effective in the treatment of severe malaria and is 
available as an IND through CDC. Artesunate is stocked at 
nine sites around the United States and can be rapidly shipped 
at no cost to clinicians. Certain guidelines and eligibility 
requirements must be met to enroll a patient in the treatment 
protocol. Physicians who administer the drug to patients must 
notify CDC of any adverse event after administration and 
comply with the IND protocol (60). To enroll a patient with 
severe malaria in this treatment protocol, health care providers 
should call the CDC Malaria Hotline at 770-488-7788 or toll-
free at 855-856-4713, Monday–Friday, 9 a.m.–5 p.m., Eastern 
time. At other times, callers should telephone 770-488-7100 
and ask to speak with a CDC Malaria Branch clinician. 
Travelers and health care providers are encouraged to use CDC 
resources on malaria prevention and treatment (Table 9), and 
contact the CDC Malaria Branch for assistance with diagnostic 
or case management needs.
Detailed recommendations for preventing malaria are available 
to the general public 24 hours a day online at http://wwwnc.
cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/infectious-diseases-related-to-
travel/malaria. Additional information on malaria prevention 
recommendations is also available through the online CDC 
malaria map application at http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/map. 
The application is an interactive map that provides information 
on malaria throughout the world. Users can search or browse 
countries, cities, and place names and get information about 
malaria in that particular location and see recommended malaria 
prophylaxis for that area. Also, CDC biannually publishes 
recommendations in Health Information for International 
Travel (commonly referred to as The Yellow Book), which is 
available and updated on the CDC Travelers’ Health website at 
 
http://www.cdc.gov/Features/TravelersHealth.html; the 
publication is also available for purchase from Oxford 
University Press, Inc., at https://global.oup.com/
academic/?cc=us&lang=en& or telephone 1-800-451-7556 
(Table 9).

Health care providers should be familiar with prevention, 
recognition, and treatment of malaria and are encouraged 
to consult appropriate sources for malaria prevention and 
treatment recommendations (Table 9). Health care providers 
should be aware of diagnostic and treatment resources 
available in their facilities, including availability at night or on 
weekends. A recent evaluation of malaria diagnosis capabilities 
among U.S. laboratories demonstrated that although malaria 
diagnostic testing services were available to the majority of 
U.S. laboratories surveyed, very few were in compliance with 
all of the current guidelines (35). To maintain and improve 
malaria and other parasitic disease diagnosis capabilities in the 
United States, CDC’s Parasitology Diagnostic Service team 
conducts training courses several times per year (http://www.
cdc.gov/dpdx/index.html). Physicians seeking assistance with 
diagnosis (including telediagnosis) or treatment of patients 
with suspected or confirmed malaria should call CDC’s Malaria 
Hotline at telephone 770-488-7788 or toll-free 855-856-4713 
during regular business hours or CDC’s Emergency Operations 
Center at telephone 770-488-7100 during evenings, weekends, 
and holidays (ask to page the person on call for the Malaria 
Branch), or access CDC’s Internet site at http://www.cdc.gov/
malaria/diagnosis_treatment/index.html. These resources are 
intended for use by health care providers only.
