As genomics advances reveal the cancer gene landscape, a daunting task is to understand
how these genes contribute to dysregulated oncogenic pathways. Integration of cancer genes
into networks offers opportunities to reveal protein–protein interactions (PPIs) with functional
and therapeutic significance. Here, we report the generation of a cancer-focused PPI network,
termed OncoPPi, and identification of 4260 cancer-associated PPIs not in other large-scale
interactomes. PPI hubs reveal new regulatory mechanisms for cancer genes like MYC, STK11,
RASSF1 and CDK4. As example, the NSD3 (WHSC1L1)–MYC interaction suggests a new
mechanism for NSD3/BRD4 chromatin complex regulation of MYC-driven tumours.
Association of undruggable tumour suppressors with drug targets informs therapeutic
options. Based on OncoPPi-derived STK11-CDK4 connectivity, we observe enhanced
sensitivity of STK11-silenced lung cancer cells to the FDA-approved CDK4 inhibitor palboci-
clib. OncoPPi is a focused PPI resource that links cancer genes into a signalling network for
discovery of PPI targets and network-implicated tumour vulnerabilities for therapeutic
interrogation.

 P
rotein–protein interactions (PPIs) form the backbone of
signal transduction pathways and networks in diverse
physiological processes1. Due to their critical roles in
relaying cell growth signals in both normal and cancer cells, once
‘undruggable’ PPIs have attracted much attention as a potential
new class of drug targets2,3. In support of this pursuit, large-scale
proteomics approaches have been utilized to generate highly
informative PPI interactomes4–6. These studies have resulted in
rich resources leading to critical insights into intricate biological
regulatory systems. However, the large number of novel PPIs
discovered in these large-scale studies demonstrate that only a
small portion of the PPI landscape is currently known4,7–10.
Further, for specific diseases such as cancer, utilization of these
large-scale datasets is limited by lack of inclusion of many
disease-specific genes, lack of experimental data in relevant
cellular environments as well as inconsistent PPI data quality
among
various
databases.
The
human
interactome
space,
particularly for disease-focused studies, remains largely open4,5,11.
In contrast, cancer genomics studies have advanced towards
comprehensive molecular characterization of human cancers,
revealing an expanded cancer gene landscape12,13 and defining a
subset of the proteome that is intimately associated with
cancer. Importantly, a large fraction of this cancer genomics
space is occupied by non-enzymatic proteins that can only be
therapeutically targeted through their molecular interactions12,13.
To complement large-scale proteomics efforts and leverage cancer
genomics data, we undertook a focused proteomics study to
discover protein interactions among a set of genes selected for
their involvement in lung cancer14,15. Our approach is supported
by the understanding that proteins involved in a certain disease
tend to interact with each other to form a disease-specific
interaction network, such as those in cancer16,17.
In this study, we establish a cancer-associated PPI network,
termed the OncoPPi network (version 1), through implementa-
tion of a streamlined time-resolved Fo
¨rster resonance energy
transfer (TR-FRET) technology platform for systematic binary
PPI discovery in an efficient high throughput format. We
discover more than 260 high-confidence PPIs not identified in
previous large-scale datasets. OncoPPi identifies prominent
protein interaction hubs with new PPI partners revolving around
key cancer drivers such as MYC, STK11, RASSF1 and CDK4,
uncovers interactions for non-enzymatic proteins, suggests cross-
talk between oncogenic pathways, implicates novel mechanisms
of action for major oncogene drivers such as transcription
factor MYC, and reveals connectivity of tumour suppressors
with actionable targets, such as the highly altered lung cancer
tumour suppressor STK11 with CDK4. The OncoPPi network
expands the lung cancer-associated protein interaction landscape
for discovery of novel cancer targets and connects tumour
suppressors to available drugs, offering an experimental resource
for exploitation of PPI-mediated cancer vulnerabilities.
Results
Defining the OncoPPi network. To generate a cancer-focused
PPI network, a robust PPI detection platform was established
using TR-FRET technology to systematically map the association
of a library of test proteins in a pairwise fashion18. A set of
83 genes was selected based on frequency of alterations in
lung cancer and known involvement in cancer signalling
pathways19–21. Genes are listed in Supplementary Data 1.
Our miniaturized, TR-FRET-based PPI platform enables high
throughput mapping in a mammalian cell environment. Due to
the stringent proximity requirement (o100 Å) to obtain a
positive FRET signal, the identified positive PPIs generally
reflect direct interactions in protein complexes18.
With streamlined workflow for PPI detection, we system-
atically tested the selected lung cancer gene set in a pairwise
manner in H1299 lung cancer cells to characterize their
inter-molecular connectivity. H1299 lung cancer cells provide a
relevant
cellular
environment
and,
with
high
transfection
efficiency, consistent TR-FRET assay performance. A total of
3,486 interactions were examined. To ensure a quality screening
dataset, each PPI pair was tested with two fusion tags for each
gene, triplicate samples and three independent rounds of
screening with fusion vector-only negative controls plus positive
controls and expression sensors included in parallel for each PPI
pair, resulting in a total dataset of 462,000 data points (Fig. 1a).
We defined a set of statistically significant PPIs (SS-PPI dataset,
Supplementary Data 2) and a more stringent set of high
confidence PPIs (HC-PPI dataset, Supplementary Data 2) based
on statistical analysis of FRET signals (Fig. 1b). The SS-PPI set
includes 798 interactions with Pr0.05. Through comparison to
publically available PPI databases including the BioPlex human
interactome4, we identified 670 novel interactions and confirmed
128 previously reported PPIs as direct interactions in lung cancer
cells (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 1). A set of 348 PPIs with
stringent criteria (HC-PPI dataset, FOCZ1.5, q-values r0.01)
were selected and combined with experimentally confirmed PPIs
to generate a set of 397 high confidence lung cancer-associated
PPIs, forming the OncoPPi network (version 1) (Figs 1c and 2a,
Supplementary Data 2). The experimental HC-PPI dataset is
enriched for known PPIs (total 128), compared to the gene library
as a whole (P-valueo3.25 � 10 � 11, hypergeometric distribution
test). With 269 novel interactions, OncoPPi greatly expands the
landscape of interactions among this selected set of lung cancer
genes (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 2) and defines interactions
with potential significance for cancer PPI target discovery,
such
as
CDK4/STK11,
LATS2/RASSF1
and
MYC/NSD3
(WHSC1L1). These datasets are freely available through the
NCI’s Cancer Target Discovery and Development (CTD2)
Network
Data
Portal
(https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/ctd2/
data-portal) and Dashboard (http://ctd2-dashboard.nci.nih.gov/).
To assess the quality of our PPI datasets, we analysed data
reproducibility and detection of false positive PPIs. We found that
97% (385) of 397 OncoPPi PPIs were detected in at least two
independent experiments with fold-over control (FOC)Z1.2.
Additionally, although PPIs are frequently detected in only one
fusion orientation due to conformational restraints, among the 397
OncoPPI interactions, 53% (209 PPIs) were detected in both fusion
directions with FOCZ1.2 (Supplementary Data 2). To evaluate the
level of detection of false-positive PPIs, we overlapped our
OncoPPi data with a reported set of B2,000 non-interacting
proteins (Negatome 2.0)22. Although, the Negatome shares only
seven PPIs with the OncoPPi set, six of those PPIs were also
negative in our screening (SFN/TSC1, YWHAZ/TSC1, TSC1/
FOXO1, E2F1/SMAD2, SMAD2/RB1 and MAPK14/HRAS). One
interaction reported in the Negatome as negative but positive in
our screening was the AKT1/TSC1 PPI. However, AKT1 is a
known regulator of TSC1/TSC2, and its specific interaction with
TSC1 has been previously confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation
from HEK293 cells23. We also examined our dataset for 14-3-3
protein interactions. Seven 14-3-3 isoforms are known to directly
bind more than 200 different proteins through well-defined and
highly conserved 14-3-3 binding motifs24,25. For the three 14-3-3
isoforms (s,g,z) included in the screening, we detected well-
validated interactors of 14-3-3 with known binding motifs,
including RAF1, BRAF, ARAF, FOXO1, LATS2, YAP1, STK11
and PRAS40, as well as homo- and heterodimers of 14-3-3.
Importantly, no 14-3-3 PPI was detected for a protein lacking a
conserved 14-3-3 binding motif. These data suggest a high-
specificity and low false-positive rate for PPIs in OncoPPi.

 OncoPPi network architecture reveals critical signalling hubs.
To gain structural insights into the OncoPPi network (Fig. 2a), we
examined features of its network topology. Indeed, the OncoPPi
network overall exhibits features of a scale-free network and
matches the general characteristics of defined biological net-
works16. For example, the node degree distribution fits the Power
law with a correlation coefficient of R ¼ 0.650, while no correlation
(R ¼ 0.367) was observed for the distribution of node clustering
coefficients. Comparing degree and betweenness centrality (BC)
index values for network nodes revealed MYC, AKT1 and STK11
as the three hub proteins most critical for the OncoPPi network
(Fig. 2b), followed by RASSF1 and LATS2. On average, each
protein in OncoPPi connects with nine protein partners, compared
to an estimated median of five protein partners in the general
proteome4,5, supporting the notion that proteins involved in the
same disease, such as cancer, tend to interact with each other16.
Details on connectivity for each hub (Z5 partners) are presented
in Figs 2 and 3 and Supplementary Table 1.

 To
infer
their
functional
association
in
cells,
cellular
co-localization and presence of shared interaction domains were
assessed for each PPI pair. Cellular co-localization of each PPI
pair was evaluated based on Gene Ontology (GO) annotations in
the UniProt database (Supplementary Data 1). We found that
84% (336) of OncoPPi interactions share common GO cellular
compartments (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 3). We next assessed
presence of complementary and conserved structural domains
and motifs that could mediate the observed PPIs. Pfam domains
(Protein families database) were mapped to each OncoPPi protein
(Supplementary Table 2) and integrated with known 3D domain–
domain interaction structural data in the 3DID database26 to
assign possible structural elements for mediating PPIs in the
OncoPPi dataset (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Data 2, Supplementary
Fig. 3). Forty-five percent (177) of the OncoPPi interactions
shared potential complementary interaction domains compared
to 16% for the overall gene set (P value of 3.47 � 10 � 49, Fisher’s
exact test, two-sided). Remaining PPIs in the network may utilize
domains and motifs yet to be defined for their associations,
offering opportunities for future discovery. Overall, 41% (164) of
OncoPPi interactions share both co-localization and interaction
domain annotations (Fig. 2e). Examples of proteins with shared
domains and co-localization include CDK4/CCND2 (Cyclin/
protein kinase domains), ARNT/HIF1a (interaction between

through Salvador/Rassf/Hippo (SARAH) domains (Fig. 2d).
The OncoPPi network also revealed prominent PPI hubs with
novel connectivity (Fig. 3a) exposing potentially critical biological
insights for cancer genes such as MYC, STK11, RASSF1 and
CDK4. To assess experimentally the physical connectivity of PPIs
in the OncoPPi network with an orthogonal approach, we
selected two major hubs for confirmation with a conventional
GST-pull down assay, the oncogene CDK4 and the tumour
suppressor RASSF1 (Fig. 3b,c). For CDK4, of 15 novel PPIs
tested, all CDK4 partners were positive in this solid phase-based
pull-down assay except ARNT, LATS2 and GLIS2 (Fig. 3b; data
not shown). Of note, bi-directional detection of PPIs did not
strictly predict ability to confirm by GST pull down, as three
confirmed CDK4 PPIs were detected in only one fusion
orientation in the primary screen (RAF1, NF2, TP53). Similarly,
10 out of 13 RASSF1 binding partners were confirmed (Fig. 3c).
Based on the high validation rate (480%), the PPI hubs
identified in our OncoPPi dataset provide a framework for PPI
target discovery and network-based functional examination of
oncogenic signalling (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1).
Integration of OncoPPi with cancer genomics data. The
OncoPPi network reveals a large number of potential PPIs for
interrogation that suggest crosstalk between important cancer
signalling pathways. We sought to leverage the available vast
cancer genomics datasets to provide independent support for the
involvement of the described PPIs in a common pathway.
Computational approaches with genomic datasets, including
mutual exclusivity and functional signature ontology (FUSION)
analyses were utilized. Mutual exclusivity analysis takes advantage
of the observation that alterations in genes participating in the
same biological process tend not to occur together in the same
cancer patient27. For mutual exclusivity analysis, the log odds
ratio (OD) values were calculated for OncoPPi node alterations in
TCGA lung cancer patient samples (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Data
1 and 2)28. Indeed, many known PPIs had positive mutual
exclusivity scores (negative Log [OD]), including MDM2/TP53
and YAP1/TEAD. For the 397 OncoPPi interactions, we found
that 257 PPIs showed potential mutual exclusivity in lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) or lung squamous cell carcinoma
(LUSC) TCGA samples, and 97 showed potential mutually
exclusivity in both the LUAD and LUSC samples (Fig. 2a,
Supplementary Data 2).
FUSION analysis was utilized as a separate orthogonal
approach
to
evaluate
functional
connectivity
of
PPIs
in
OncoPPi v1 (ref. 29). As previously described, FUSION uses
expression patterns for a defined endogenous reporter gene set
(ACSL5, ALDOC, BNIP3, BNIP3L, LOXL2, NDRG1) to establish
cellular response signatures to individual gene knockdowns. We
hypothesized that functionally important OncoPPi interactions
would have similar FUSION signatures for interacting protein
pairs. FUSION reporter expression signatures were determined
for each OncoPPi gene (Supplementary Table 3) and then a
similarity matrix of reporter gene signatures using Pearson
correlation values (R) as a distance metric (Supplementary
Table 4) was constructed. We found that known PPIs involved
in defined oncogenic pathways, including PI3K-AKT1-PRAS40-
mTOR and CDK4-RB1-E2F1, had significant R values (|R|40.5),
providing validation of the FUSION approach for detecting
functional connections (Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary
Data 2, Supplementary Table 4). Overlaying the set of 397
OncoPPi interactions with FUSION positive PPI pairs revealed
that 116 physical PPIs can be associated through FUSION
(P value of 0.0483 using hypergeometric distribution, data in
Supplementary Data 2).
Positive mutual exclusivity and FUSION scores support
pathway crosstalk mediated by interacting proteins. For novel
interactions, these scores can be integrated with other functional
data for PPI target prioritization and hypothesis testing. Thus,
the OncoPPi dataset and the associated functional analysis are
expected to inspire novel hypothesis-driven research for major
cancer driver PPIs and their functional interconnections among
critical signalling pathways. As examples, the oncogenic driver
CDK4 showed not only expected interactions with known
partners, cyclins and CDK inhibitors, but also several protein
kinases (Fig. 3b). Growth factor receptors and mitogen activated
protein kinases have well-established roles in regulating CDK4
activity primarily through transcriptional activation of cyclins
and posttranslational modification of both cyclins and CDK4
inhibitors30. The physical interaction of CDK4 with the identified
protein kinases may engage CDK4 at multiple stages of the
cell growth regulatory pathways through membrane-associated
receptors, PDGFRA and FGFR, and the MAPK signalling
cascade, RAF1, MKK3 and MKK5, and stress-response kinases
AKT1
and
STK11.
The directionality of
these regulatory
mechanisms remains to be established. RASSF1, a member of
the Ras association domain family, is known as a tumour
suppressor that inhibits RAF1 signalling and activates MST131.
The interaction of RASSF1 with the NF2-MST1/2-LAST2 module
of the HIPPO pathway raises the possibility that RASSF1 may
couple the membrane-associated NF2 complex to the core
HIPPO signalling pathway. The interaction of RASSF1 with
SMARCA4, on the other hand, may localize RASSF1 to the
SMARCA4-mediated chromatin remodelling complex to regulate
the expression of growth regulatory genes, such as CD4432,33.
Mutual exclusivity and FUSION analysis also support placement
of MYC in signalling pathways with transcription factors
HIF1a/HIF1b
(ARNT)
and
TEAD2
and
an
epigenetic
modulator NSD3 (WHSC1L1)34, suggesting a new mechanism
for MYC regulation. These implicated pathways suggest novel
models of cell growth control and potential PPI targets for further
experimental exploration.
OncoPPi network suggests a BRD4-NSD3-MYC pathway.
MYC, a global regulator of gene expression, is frequently
amplified in a large number of tumours (10% of LUADs) and
plays a prominent role in tumorigenesis. MYC contains multiple
structural motifs that mediate interactions with a number of
regulatory proteins35. Our OncoPPi network confirmed reported
MYC binders, such as GCN5 and SMAD2, and also revealed 23
new potential interaction partners for MYC, including NSD3.
To test an OncoPPi-generated hypothesis and gain mechanistic
insights, the NSD3-MYC interaction was further examined.
NSD3 is a member of the nuclear receptor-binding SET
domain (NSD) family of histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36)
methyltransferases. It is frequently amplified and functions as
an oncoprotein in lung tumours and a range of other cancers34.
NSD3 has two isoforms, a long form with the methytransferase
domain and a short form (NSD3-s) without the enzymatic
activity. Interestingly, NSD3-s serves as an adaptor to link BRD4
to the CHD8 chromatin remodelling protein36. NSD3-s binding
to MYC as revealed in OncoPPi may regulate MYC’s access
to designated chromatin complexes. Indeed, dose-dependent
TR-FRET and affinity pull-down assay confirmed the interaction
of NSD3-s with MYC (Fig. 4a,b). The endogenous NSD3-s/MYC
complexes were also detected in lung cancer H1299 and H1944
cells under physiological conditions by co-immunoprecipitation
(Fig. 4c,d). This MYC interaction appears to be mediated by a
region C-terminal to the PWWP motif of NSD3-s (Fig. 4e,f).

Figure 4 | OncoPPi-suggested regulatory mechanism for the MYC oncogene. (a) Direct interaction of NSD3-s with MYC. GST-MYC and
Venus-Flag-tagged NSD3-s were expressed in HEK293Tcells. Tb-conjugated anti-GST-antibodies were incubated with cell lysates to detect GST-MYC. The
TR-FRET signal is expressed as the FRETratio (520 nm/486 nm � 104) Representative results of three independent experiments are shown. The error bars
show the mean±s.d. of three replicates. (b) NSD3–s/MYC interaction by GST-affinity pull-down assay. GST-MYC was captured by glutathione-resin to
probe the presence of Flag-NSD3-s with western blotting. (c,d) Endogenous interaction of NSD3-s with MYC. The NSD3-s/MYC complex was
co-immunoprecipitated with an anti-MYC antibody from lung cancer (c) H1299 and (d) H1944 cells with anti-IgG as control. (e) Schematic diagram of

transcriptional activity. HEK293Tcells were co-transfected with Venus-NSD3-s and either wild-type or mutant E-box luciferase reporter. Relative luciferase
activity was measured, normalized to internal Renilla luciferase control. Representative results of three independent experiments are shown. The error bars
show the mean±s.d. of three replicates. (j) NSD3-s interacts with MYC, NSD3-s and BRD4. GST-NSD3-s was co-transfected with FLAG-tagged constructs
for MYC, NSD3-s and BRD4 into HEK293T cells, followed by affinity chromatography with glutathione-conjugated beads, SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting
with anti-Flag antibodies. (k) Proposed working model. BRD4 utilizes its ET domain to regulate MYC through a transcription-independent mechanism via
the BRD4-NSD3-MYC pathway, in addition to the well-established BRD4-pTEFb-mediated pathway via the C-terminal fragment of BRD4. Both BRD4 and
NSD3-s interact with modified histones.

 fragment of NSD3-s (1–347), stabilized MYC protein (Fig. 4g,h)
and increased MYC transcriptional activity as revealed by a
MYC-driven reporter assay (Fig. 4i). These data led to the
hypothesis that NSD3-s functions as a new activator of MYC
oncogenic activity by bridging MYC with BRD4 to allow the
regulation of MYC function in response to epigenetic modulators.
Indeed, NSD3-s can be found in a complex with both MYC and
BRD4 with distinct sites for respective interactions (Fig. 4e,f,j).
Our results led to a working model that BRD4 regulates MYC
through a transcription-independent mechanism by means of the
BRD4-NSD3-MYC pathway, in addition to the well-established
BRD4-pTEFb-mediated pathway (Fig. 4k), which may have
significant clinical implications for the response of MYC-driven
tumours to BRD4 inhibitors that are currently in clinical trials.
Because both the short and the long forms of NSD3 can bind
MYC
(data
not
shown),
it
remains
possible
that
both
methytransferase-dependent and independent mechanisms are
involved in the regulation of MYC by NSD3.
Linking challenging targets with pharmacological agents.
Another important application of the OncoPPi network is to
reveal potential intervention strategies for tumour suppressors
through direct linkage to actionable cancer targets with FDA
approved drugs. For example, major tumour suppressors, such as
STK11 and TP53, could be connected with druggable targets
like CDK4 and MDM2, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5,
Supplementary Table 5). STK11 is one of the most frequently
mutated tumour suppressors in lung cancer (after TP53 and
KRas)37. STK11 loss in an activated KRas mutant background
significantly exacerbates tumorigenesis potential and tumour
progression38,39 supporting its critical role in maintaining normal
cell growth. STK11 controls cell growth in part through its
activation of the AMPK pathway40; however, the exact signalling
pathways by which STK11 exerts its tumour suppressor function
remain to be clarified. The interaction of STK11 with CDK4 leads
to the hypothesis that the tumour suppressor function of STK11
may be in part mediated by engaging the cell cycle regulatory
machinery through its direct interaction with and inhibition of
CDK4 activity (Fig. 5a). Mutual exclusivity analysis with genomic
alteration data showed that STK11 alterations in cancer patients
rarely co-occur with CDK4, CDKN2A, CDKN2B or RB1,
supporting a role for STK11 in an oncogenic pathway that is
intimately associated with cell cycle function (Fig. 5b). Gene
depletion
phenotypes
for
STK11
and
CDK4
appear
to
anti-correlate as shown by FUSION analysis (Fig. 5c). As such,
STK11 may be physically and functionally associated with CDK4.
This mechanistic relationship would nominate STK11 mutant
lung cancer for therapeutic intervention with CDK4 inhibitors.
Indeed, using STK11 copy number and mRNA expression data in
the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia to define cell lines with high
(STK11 High, 41 cell lines) and low (STK11 Low, 22 cell lines)
STK11 expression, we observed significantly greater palbociclib
sensitivity (P ¼ 0.002, two-sided T-test) for the STK11 Low group
(Supplementary Fig. 6, see Discussion).
To examine the potential connectivity of STK11 with CDK4,
both physical and functional interaction of STK11 and CDK4
were examined. First, the interaction of STK11 with CDK4 in live
cells was confirmed with a Renilla luciferase-based protein
fragmentation
complementation
assay
(Fig.
5d).
Similarly,
STK11 showed a significant signal with CCND2, a regulator
of CDK4, supporting the interaction of STK11 with the
CDK4/CCND2 complex. Endogenous co-immunoprecipitation
experiments demonstrated the STK11/CDK4 interaction under
physiological conditions in multiple lung cancer cell lines,
including H1299 and H1792 cells (Fig. 5e,f). Further, knockdown
of STK11 was correlated with enhanced CDK4 kinase activity as
shown by increased phosphorylation of RB (pRB), a physiological
CDK4 substrate (Fig. 5g). Reconstitution of the knockdown
cells with STK11 reversed the effect, suggesting a functional
interaction.
To examine the therapeutic potential of the STK11/CDK4
connectivity, we utilized an FDA-approved small molecule
CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor, palbociclib/PD-0332991, to probe the
effect of CDK4 inhibition on STK11 activity41. Treatment of
H1792 lung cancer cells (Fig. 5h) with palbociclib led to reduced
pRB. Interestingly, reduced pRB triggered by palbociclib was
correlated with reduced STK11 present in the CDK4 complex
(Fig. 5i), suggesting release of STK11 from the CDK4 complex.
It is unclear if the differences in concentration required for
disruption of the CDK4/STK11 complex vs CDK4 catalytic
inhibition are due to differences in sensitivities of techniques or
reflect different biological mechanisms. It is possible that
palbociclib could have a dual effect: not only inhibiting the
CDK4-pRB axis, but also activating the STK11-pAMPK pathway.
Indeed, treatment of lung cancer H1792 cells with palbociclib
enhanced pAMPK and inhibited pRb (Fig. 5h). The pAMPK
effect appeared to be STK11 dependent. Lung cancer A549 cells
with defective STK11 (Q37*) (data not shown) or cell lines with
STK11 knockdown showed undetectable effect on pAMPK when
treated with palbociclib (Fig. 5h).
This observation led to the examination of the effect of STK11
genomic status on cell response to palbociclib. A pair of isogenic
cell lines with differential STK11 gene status was utilized in a cell
viability assay. It was shown previously that reduced STK11 was
associated with increased sensitivity to phenformin42, which was
confirmed and used as a positive control (Fig. 5j). Similarly, when
treated with palbociclib, STK11 silenced cells showed increased
sensitivity over the parental H1792 cells (Fig. 5k). On the other
hand, overexpression of the STK11 gene in STK11-negative H157
cells reversed their response to palbociclib, showing reduced
sensitivity (Fig. 5l). Thus, loss of STK11 in lung cancer cells may
lead to enhanced sensitivity to palbociclib, demonstrating an
STK11-loss evoked enhanced-dependency of cells on CDK4. Due
to extensive heterogeneity of NSCLC cell lines, a large panel of
cell lines with multiple rigorous experimental approaches will be
required to validate our observations. The use of two isogenic cell
lines was the first attempt to establish any correlation between the
STK11 status and sensitivity to palbociclib. The observed positive
correlation supports future testing of this hypothesis to examine a
potential therapeutic strategy for treating lung cancer patients
harbouring STK11 alterations with a CDK4 inhibitor such as
palbociclib.
Discussion
This study reports the generation of an expanded lung cancer-
associated PPI network, termed OncoPPi (v1), through the
implementation of a TR-FRET-based high-throughput screening
approach. The focused binary PPI screening coupled with a
robust
miniaturized
screening
platform
allows
a
rigorous
experimental design generating 18 data points for each PPI to
ensure high-confidence PPI data for future hypothesis-driven
investigations. OncoPPi unveils important PPIs in cancer not
detected in previous interactome studies, and also integrates
physical interaction, genomics and pharmacologic data to inform
novel biology and therapeutic strategies. Previous large-scale
interactome studies have indicated that much of the PPI
landscape is still undescribed. Indeed, with our focused set of
83 lung cancer genes, we identify 4260 novel interactions,
expanding the PPI landscape for this gene set by 4200%,
including for well-studied cancer genes like MYC and CDK4.

 Available to the community, OncoPPi is a valuable resource for
discovery of cancer-associated PPIs as potential drug targets,
examining network-informed signalling crosstalk, and predicting
network-implicated tumour vulnerability, informative biomarkers
and new strategies to target challenging cancer drivers.
Usefulness of high-throughput-derived PPI data depends on its
reproducibility,
as
well
as
ability
to
detect
true
positive
interactions. For the OncoPPi network, 97% of interactions
were detected in at least two independent experiments (the other
3% were statistically significant, previously described PPIs).
Fifty-three percent of OncoPPi interactions were detected in
both fusion tag orientations. This result was expected, as
structural factors can interfere with the ability to detect
interactions for some orientations of fusion tags. Indeed, a
number
of
previously
known
control
PPIs
(for
example
14-3-3/YAP1 and CDK4/CDKN2A) and confirmed OncoPPi
interactions (for example CDK4/RAF1 and CDK4/TP53, Fig. 3b
and Supplementary Data 2) can be captured in only one of the
fusion pairs. PPI results in Supplementary Data 2 include bi-
directional detection information (column BFD) for further
analysis by the scientific community. Overall, we found that
480% of tested OncoPPi interactions could be confirmed by GST
pull down. Of note, unlike the TR-FRET assay, GST pull downs
require stringent wash steps; thus, the 20% of PPIs not confirmed
could represent both false positives and lower affinity interactions
disrupted by wash steps. Our results with the Negatome and
14-3-3 binding motif indicate a low false positive rate for
OncoPPi overall.
Despite transformative advances in cancer care towards
precision oncology, clinical successes from genomics-based
targeted cancer therapies remain largely focused on oncogenic
enzymes, particularly protein kinases. Such enzymes offer
druggable sites for therapeutic modulation of their catalytic
activities. However, the majority of cancer driver genes identified
through cancer genomics efforts encode ‘undruggable’ proteins
such as (i) tumour suppressors with loss of function in cancer and
(ii) adaptor proteins with no enzymatic activity, posing a major
hurdle for therapeutic intervention13. These challenging cancer
drivers function by participating in protein complexes that are
involved in diverse cellular functions. Our approach addresses
these challenges by placing cancer driver genes, both oncogenes
and tumour suppressors, in the context of growth signalling PPI
networks, offering unique opportunities to define promising
therapeutic
strategies
for protein
targets
with or
without
enzymatic
activity.
The
described
PPIs
that
link
adaptor
proteins and tumour suppressors with well-annotated cancer
drivers and actionable targets represent a wealth of potential new
targets for therapeutic discovery and development (Figs 3–5).
It should be noted that our TR-FRET-based high throughput PPI
screening method utilizes co-expression of exogenous protein
pairs. The presence of these interactions under physiological
and pathological conditions should be validated to examine
their
functional
importance.
As
examples,
we
illustrate
OncoPPi-generated
new
hypotheses
for
future
pathway
perturbagen discovery through interrogating MYC and STK11
PPIs. Demonstration of two selected PPIs, MYC/NSD3 and
STK11/CDK4, under endogenous conditions in multiple lung
cancer cell lines strongly supports the validity of the OncoPPi
network data set for further examination.
The MYC oncogene, which represents a highly validated and
studied oncogenic cancer target, has no approved therapies that
directly target the protein. This is due, in part, to the lack of
enzymatic activity and defined catalytic site for structure activity
guided design of potent compounds. Thus, it is recognized that
the MYC interactome may represent a viable option to inhibit
this pathway for therapeutic benefit35. Newly uncovered MYC
binding partners in the OncoPPi network serve as examples to
illustrate
OncoPPi-inferred
new
signalling
pathways
for
regulation
of
MYC-driven
cell
growth
and
oncogenic
programmes (Figs 2–4). We selected the physical interaction of
MYC with NSD3 for validation, and uncovered a potential
positive regulatory function for NSD3 in activating MYC,
implicating the BRD4-NSD3-MYC pathway as a potential target
for interrogating MYC-driven tumours. Because BRD4 inhibitors,
such as JQ1, have been shown to be active against MYC-driven
tumours, the intimate connection of NSD3-s with BRD4 and with
MYC supports the hypothesis that NSD3-s may play a critical role
in directing MYC-driven oncogenic programmes and may recruit
MYC to a chromatin location through NSD3-s recognition of
H3K36me3 and its association with acetylated lysine-BRD4,
which warrants further investigation (Fig. 4k). The potential
clinical importance of this connectivity is supported by the
NSD3–MYC interaction in the NSD3-NUT fusion-driven NUT
midline carcinoma43. It is very likely that the NSD3–NUT fusion
may be critical for maintenance of MYC expression in these
cancer cells. It is expected that other cancer drivers beyond MYC
can also be exploited in a similar manner to guide functional
validation and therapeutic discoveries.
Another application of the OncoPPi network is to reveal new
tumour dependencies linked to tumour suppressor status (Fig. 5,
Supplementary Fig. 5). Connectivity of STK11 with CDK4
suggests a potential application of CDK4 inhibitors for the
treatment of patients with defective STK11. Here we demon-
strated that STK11 directly interacts with and serves as a negative
regulator of CDK4. Reduced STK11 levels have been correlated
with enhanced CDK4 function. Thus, it is hypothesized that loss
of STK11 in lung cancer may lead to enhanced dependency on
upregulated CDK4. In support of this notion, lung cancer cells
with reduced STK11 appear to be more sensitive than STK11
wild-type cells to palbociclib (Fig. 5). This observation is
supported by the CDK4-mTORC1 pathway association as shown
in
breast
cancer44.
In
addition,
although
heterogeneous
mutational status of STK11 may be masked in large-scale
genomics datasets, using Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia datasets
we observed increased palbociclib sensitivity for cell lines with
low STK11 copy number and mRNA expression (Supplementary
Fig. 6). Our results imply that it will be informative to use STK11
status as a biomarker for evaluating palbociclib efficacy. However,
it should be cautioned that due to mutational heterogeneity of
STK11 and the relatively high concentrations of palbociclib used
to observe the drug response in lung cancer cells, future studies
will be needed to probe the molecular basis for STK11-directed
therapeutic strategies. We also note that palbociclib inhibits both
CDK4 and CDK6, and we detected interaction of STK11 with
both CDK4 and CDK6 (Fig. 3a). It is possible that the observed
effect in Fig. 5 is due to dual inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6 by
palbociclib, which requires further experimental examination.
Similarly, other connectivity in the OncoPPi network may
suggest therapeutic strategies for other actionable targets with
approved drugs. Examples include dasatinib for EPHA2 and
EPHA2-associated tumour suppressors, LATS2 and CDKN2B.
PPIs are highly promising targets for therapeutic discovery.
This point is highlighted by recent clinical success in cancer
immunotherapy.
Current
therapies
re-direct
immunological
functions by interfering with the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction,
supporting the concept of targeting PPIs in the immune system.
To build on such success, our studies provide both potential
PPI targets for manipulating oncogenic pathways, as well as
highly sensitive high throughput screening (HTS) assays for
PPI pathway perturbagen discovery. The TR-FRET assay format
has been widely used in the HTS field for small molecule

Methods
Expression libraries for lung cancer-associated genes. Genes collected for the
current studies are listed in Supplementary Data 1 along with their sources,
association with cancer (tumour suppressor/oncogene) and alterations in TCGA
lung cancer datasets (provisional data sets downloaded 1/2016). Each gene was
subcloned into the indicated Gateway entry vector (Invitrogen). The integrity of the
genes was confirmed by BsrGI restriction digestion and by sequencing, generating
the Entry-vector library. Genes in the entry vector library were transferred using
the Gateway recombination system to destination expression vectors to produce a
GST-gene fusion and a Venus-Flag-gene fusion for each gene, generating the
OncoPPi expression vector library. PDONR223-EGFR, pDONR223-MET were
gifts from William Hahn and David Root (Addgene plasmids #23935, #23889)45.
pGBT9-NF1-GRD was a gift from Fuyuhiko Tamanoi (Addgene plasmid
# 19993)46.
High throughput PPI screening. We utilized the unique spectral overlap of
terbium with Venus to develop a TR-FRET system that only requires the addition
of one fluorophore during the assay process47. GST- and Venus-fusion proteins
allow the coupling of anti-GST antibody-conjugated donor fluorophore, terbium,
to fused Venus for FRET detection in solution to identify direct PPIs. For every
PPI, GST- and Venus-only negative controls were included in parallel in every
round of screening. To enable HTS for large-scale PPI detection, a cell lysate-based
TR-FRET assay in a 384-well HTS format was developed. Briefly, H1299 lung
cancer cells (2,500) were cultured in 384-well plates at 37 �C before they were
co-transfected in wells with Venus-tagged genes in combination with GST-tagged
genes using the Fugene HD reagent (Roche), assisted by robotic operations with the
Sciclone ALH 3,000 liquid handling workstation (PerkinElmer). After incubation
for 48 h, whole cell lysates were prepared by replacing the medium with lysis buffer
(40 mM of Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 137 mM of NaCl, 1 mM of NaCl, 5 mM of NaF, 5 mM
of NaPyrophosphate, 1% nonident P-40 (IGEPAL CA-630, Sigma-Aldrich) with
proteinase inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors) followed by a freeze-and-thaw
cycle. Anti-GST-terbium antibody (Cisbio Bioassays Cat# 61GSTTLB, 1:1,000
dilution) was dispensed into each well with Multidrop Combi Reagent Dispenser
(ThermoScientific). The lysate-antibody mixtures were incubated at 4 �C before the
TR-FRET signal was recorded (EnVision reader setting: Ex 337 nm, Em1: 520 nm,
Em2: 486 nm; mirror: D400/D505 dual; time delay: 50 ms). The TR-FRET signal is
expressed as the FRET ratio (F520/F486 � 104). The expression of test fusion genes
was monitored through fused Venus or GST. The expression of Venus-tagged
proteins was captured by fluorescence intensity (FI) (Ex 485 nm and Em 535 nm,
mirror 505 nm). Venus-tagged gene expression was measured based on the Venus
FI and calculated with the equation FI ¼ (FIsignal/FIbackground) where FIsignal and
FIbackground are the fluorescent signal of the cell lysates with Venus-tagged gene or
untransfected cells, respectively. GST-tagged protein expression was monitored
through a coupled GST-sensor assay (see below). With the established gene library
and miniaturized assay, a pairwise TR-FRET screening was performed in triplicate
and in both vector orientations (that is GST-Gene1/Venus-Flag-Gene 2 and GST-
Gene2/Venus-FLAG-Gene 1), for a total of 3,486 protein–protein pairs � 2
orientations � 3 replicates � 3 independent experiments to generate 62,748 data
points. To reduce false positive PPIs resulting from non-specific interactions
between a ‘bait’ protein and the tag of a ‘prey’ protein (for example GST-
or Venus-tag), each protein–protein pair (for example GST-protein
1/Venus-protein 2) was tested in triplicate in parallel with two corresponding
matched negative control pairs (GST-protein 1/Venus-control, and
GST-control/Venus-protein 2), with FOC calculated against the highest matching
control signal for each individual PPI pair (see below).
GST-fusion biosensor and experimental quality control. To monitor the
expression of test genes for the GST-fusion constructs, we developed a
GST-biosensor for measuring GST-protein expression. The GST-biosensor is
based on a TR-FRET assay, which includes two components, AlexaFluor555
conjugated-GST protein and anti-GST-Terbium (Tb) antibody. The purified
GST-protein was labelled with AlexFluor555. The binding of anti-GST-Tb
antibody to AlexaFluor555-GST protein brings TR-FRET donor (Tb) and acceptor
(AlexFluo555) into proximity, leading to the generation of robust TR-FRET signal
from GST-biosensor. Upon the addition of the GST-biosensor to PPI screening cell
lysate, the expression of GST-tagged protein in cell lysate competes the binding of
anti-GST-Tb to AlexFluor555, leading to the decreased TR-FRET signal. Therefore,
the decreased GST-biosensor TR-FRET signal is correlated with the amount of
GST-protein in the cell lysate.
PPI network data analysis and statistics. Calculations of fold-over control values.
The FOC values were calculated for each PPI with the equation FOC ¼ Max
{[SG1V2/Max(SG1,SV2)],[SG2V1/Max(SG2,SV1)]}, where G1 is GST-tagged protein 1,
V1 is Venus-tagged protein 1 and S is TR-FRET signal. For each experiment the
average TR-FRET signals for the PPI (SG1V2, SG2V1), GST empty vector control
(SG1,G2) and Venus empty vector control (SV1,V2) were calculated from the
triplicates for each of two tested fusions (GST, Venus). Then, for each fusion the
FOC values were calculated by dividing the average PPI signal by the maximum
value of the two empty fusion vector controls. The maximum of the two FOC
values obtained for the two fusions (GST, Venus) was considered as the final FOC
value for a given PPI per experiment. Then, the average FOC values (FOCAVR)
were calculated by averaging the FOC values from individual experiments. These
values were considered to be the final FOC value for a given PPI.
Statistical significance. The statistical significance of the differences in PPI and
control signals was calculated with the rank sum permutation test. The calculations
were performed using the MatLab package (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA).
The raw TR-FRET PPI signals detected for both fusions in triplicate in three
independent experiments, and the corresponding signals of empty vector controls
were used to build the PPI and Control groups, respectively. For each PPI the
permutation test was performed according to the following procedure. First, for a
given PPI pair, all PPI and control signals obtained in all experiments were ranked.
The sum of the ranks of the PPI signals was calculated and was used as the test
statistic for the permutation test. A total of 10,000 permutations were done. The
P value was calculated with the equation P ¼ (Ns þ 1)/10,001, where Ns—number of
cases where total ranks of shuffled labels exceed or are equal to that of true label. The
false discovery rate and corresponding q-values were calculated with the Benjamini–
Hochberg procedure; q-values less than 0.05 were considered significant.
PPI mapping and network topology analysis. The PPI network was constructed,
visualized and analysed with Cytoscape 3.2 (ref. 48). Specifically, the node degree,
BC index, network density and average number of neighbours were calculated
using the Cytoscape Network Analysis tool. A tendency of nodes to form clusters
can be characterized by cluster coefficients Ci ¼ 2ni/k(k � 1), where ni—number of
edges connecting ki neighbours of node i to each other.
Defining the set of known PPIs. Data for known PPIs were extracted from public
PPI databases for the OncoPPi gene set (Supplementary Data 2). PPI databases
utilized included: String9, BioGrid7, Intact8, GeneMania10 and BioPlex4 and were
limited to PPIs with reported physical association. For the OncoPPi gene set, a total
of 364 PPIs were extracted from the databases, including 132 from String, 195 from
IntAct, 260 from GeneMania and 281 from BioGrid. Overall, 73 PPIs were
reported in all four databases, 90 in at least three databases, 105 in at least two
databases and 96 PPIs appeared in only one of the four datasets.
Co-localization and shared interacting domain analysis. Protein localization data
were extracted from the UniProt database based on GO annotations49 for the set of
OncoPPi genes (Supplementary Data 1). Analysis of co-localization was performed
for the entire set of tested PPIs (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Data 2). Compartments
with shared protein localization for OncoPPi PPIs included the extrinsic
component of membrane, endosome membrane, myelin sheath, intracellular
membrane-bounded organelle, intracellular, endoplasmic reticulum membrane,
endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, integral component of membrane, perinuclear
region of cytoplasm, focal adhesion, extracellular space, membrane, plasma
membrane, cytosol, cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Data 2).
Structural domains for the OncoPPi genes were extracted from Pfam50. Data for
domains involved in physical associations in co-crystallized proteins were extracted
from the 3DID database26 and utilized to annotate PPI pairs with known
interacting domains for the 3,486 tested PPIs (Fig. 2d).
Mutual exclusivity and FUSION analysis. Mutual exclusivity analysis was
performed in MatLab with the Cancer Genomics Data Server tool box28,51.
The complete tumour samples from LUAD and LUSC TCGA Provisional datasets
(downloaded January 2016, Supplementary Data 1) were used to analyse the
mutual exclusivity of genomic alterations in lung cancer patient samples.
Mutations, DNA amplifications and deletions were taken into account. Mutual
exclusivity was evaluated in terms of log odds ratio (OD) values calculated as
described previously28. The alterations of two genes were considered as mutually
exclusive if Log(OD)o0 (Supplementary Data 2).
Functional Signature Ontology (FUSION) analysis was performed as
described29. Specifically, mRNA expression data of six reporter genes (ACSL5,
BNIP3, BNIP3L, ALDOC, LOXL2 and NDRG1) obtained in HCT116 cells for
individual gene knockdowns was used. Pearson correlations between mRNA
expression patterns of the reporter genes corresponding to the knockdowns of two
target genes were calculated with the MatLab package. The absolute value of 0.5
was used as a cut-off to determine functionally connected gene pairs. Correlations
were obtained for all combinations of all genes tested in the HT PPI screening,
except 14-3-3g, GLIS1 and TTYH2, for which the corresponding data of reporter
gene expression was not available (Supplementary Tables 3,4).
Molecular biology techniques and cell culture conditions. Standard molecular
biology protocols were followed for making individual cloning vectors and
truncation mutants. Human lung cancer cells H1299 (ATCC CRL-5803), H1944
(ATCC CRL-5907), H1792 (ATCC CRL-5895), H157 (ATCC CRL-5802), A549
(ATCC CCL-185) (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing

 L-glutamine (CORNING Cat# 10-040) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
and 100 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin. H157 lung cancer cells were used as
STK11-null control for the expression of exogenous STK11 to generate isogenic
STK11 cell line pair. Stable pLKO.1 vector control and LKB1-siRNA(408) H1299
and H1792 cells were created by lentiviral infection using specific siRNA constructs
from Open Biosystems (Rockford, IL, USA) as described52. The stable transfected
H157 (GFP) and H157 (GFP-STK11) cell lines were generated as previously
described53. HEK293T (ATCC CRL-3216) cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were
maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM), with 4.5 g/L glucose,
L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate (CAT# 10-013-CV CellGro) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and 1X penicillin/streptomycin solution (CellGro). Cells
were incubated at 37 �C in humidified conditions with 5% CO2. For drug treatment
for pathway analysis studies, cells were serum-starved for 24 h, then treated with
either vehicle or the indicated concentration of the CDK4 inhibitor palbociclib
(PD-0332991, SelleckChem) for 6 h. All cell lines have been tested for mycoplasma
contamination.
Affinity pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. For GST-affinity pull-
down assays, cells were lysed in 1% NP-40 buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES
(pH 7.5), 1% nonident P-40 (IGEPAL CA-630, Sigma-Aldrich), 5 mM sodium
pyrophosphate, 5 mM NaF, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mg/L aprotinin,
10 mg/L leupeptin and 1 mM PMSF) and incubated with glutathione-conjugated
beads (GE 17527901) for 2 h at 4 �C. Beads were washed three times with 1% NP-
40 buffer and eluted by boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) loading buffer. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates
were collected, quantified and were mixed with respective antibodies. For each
co-immunoprecipitation, lysates containing B1.5 mg of total proteins were used
and the antibody/lysate mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 �C. Then protein
A/D agarose beads were added to the mixture followed by incubation at 4 �C for
another 4 h. Beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, and proteins were
eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analysed with indicated antibodies. The
following primary antibodies were used for western blotting at the final dilution of
1:1,000 unless otherwise indicated: rabbit anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
sc-459, 1:2,500 dilution); mouse anti-Flag (Sigma A8592, 1:2,500 dilution, or Sigma
F3165, 1:2,500 dilution); rabbit anti-MYC (Santa Cruz, sc-764); mouse anti-RB
(Cell Signaling, 9309 S); rabbit anti-phospho-RB (RB pS780, Cell Signaling 9307 S);
rabbit anti-AMPK (Cell Signaling, 2532 L); rabbit anti-phospho-AMPK (Cell
Signaling, 2535 L); mouse anti-b-Actin (Sigma, A5441); rabbit anti-LKB1/
STK11(Cell Signaling, 3047 S); goat anti-NSD3 (Santa Cruz, sc-50152,
1:200 dilution). The mouse anti-CDK4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-70831,
1:50 dilution) and rabbit anti-MYC (Santa Cruz, sc-764, 1:100 dilution) were used
for immunoprecipitation assays. Uncropped gels for data presented can be found in
Supplementary Figures 7–11.
Protein stability assays. Protein stability assays were performed according
to established methods54. In brief, HEK293T cells were transfected using
Xtreme-Gene (Roche 6366546001) following the manufacturer’s instructions. After
transfection, cells were incubated for 48 h in DMEM media supplemented with
10% FBS, then were treated with 100 mg/ml cycloheximide (2112, Cell Signaling) in
DMEM media with 10% FBS. At the indicated times. 100 ml of 2X SDS-PAGE
sample buffer was added and the cells were scraped from the wells, boiled for
5 min, then cell lysates were stored at � 80 �C. After all lysates were collected, each
sample was loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and then analysed by western
blotting with rabbit anti-MYC antibody (5605, Cell Signaling, 1:1,000) to monitor
MYC protein level. Protein expression was quantified from the western blot using
GelQuant software. For analysis, MYC levels were normalized to tubulin protein
levels (mouse, T-5326, Sigma, 1:2,000). Assays were performed three times.
MYC reporter assay. HEK293T cells were grown in six-well plates and transfected
using Xtreme-Gene (Roche 6366546001) with Venus-FLAG-NSD3s or Venus
vector along with Myc-Ebox-containing luciferase reporter plasmids, with either
wild-type (GCCACGTGGCCACGTGGCCACGTGGC) or mutant (GCCTCGAG
GCCTCGAGGCCTCGAGGC) E-boxes driving expression of firefly luciferase55.
Renilla luciferase was included as an internal control. After transfection, cells
were incubated for 48 h in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells
were harvested mechanically, centrifuged at 1,600 r.p.m. for 10 min, and then
re-suspended in 300 ml of DMEM media. The cells were transferred to 384-well
plate, and the Myc reporter assay was performed using Dual-Glo luciferase kit
(Promega, E2920) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Firefly luciferase
expression was normalized to the internal control Renilla expression. Data were
analysed with Graphpad Prism software. Assays were performed three times.
HTS cell viability assay. Cells were seeded at 500 cells/well in 7 ml media in a
1536-well culture plate (Corning, Cat#3893) using a Multidrop Combi Reagent
Dispenser (ThermoScientific) with the first column as a medium only control (blk).
The next day test compounds (0.1 ul) were dispensed into wells in each plate using
a Sciclone ALH 3,000 liquid handler (PerkinElmer) from a compound stock plate
to give the indicated final concentrations. Each sample was tested with four
replicates. After 3 days of incubation, Cell Titer Blue (1 ml; Promega, G8081) was
added to each well using the robotic liquid dispenser. The plate was incubated for
1–4 h at 37 �C. The FI of each well was read using an EnVision Multilabel plate
reader (Ex 545 nm, Em 615 nm; PerkinElmer). % of control was calculated using
the equation (FIcompound � FIAvg. Blk)/(FIAvg. Neg � FIAvg. Blk � 100).
