Abstract
Adipose tissue has emerged as an important regulator of whole-body metabolism, and its
capacity to dissipate energy in the form of heat has acquired a special relevance in recent
years as potential treatment for obesity. In this context, the p38MAPK pathway has arisen
as a key player in the thermogenic program because it is required for the activation of brown
adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis and participates also in the transformation of white adi-
pose tissue (WAT) into BAT-like depot called beige/brite tissue. Here, using mice that are
deficient in p38α specifically in adipose tissue (p38αFab-KO), we unexpectedly found that
lack of p38α protected against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. We also showed that
p38αFab-KO mice presented higher energy expenditure due to increased BAT thermogene-
sis. Mechanistically, we found that lack of p38α resulted in the activation of the related pro-
tein kinase family member p38δ. Our results showed that p38δ is activated in BAT by cold
exposure, and lack of this kinase specifically in adipose tissue (p38δ Fab-KO) resulted in over-
weight together with reduced energy expenditure and lower body and skin surface tempera-
ture in the BAT region. These observations indicate that p38α probably blocks BAT
thermogenesis through p38δ inhibition. Consistent with the results obtained in animals,
p38α was reduced in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue of subjects with obesity and
was inversely correlated with body mass index (BMI). Altogether, we have elucidated a
mechanism implicated in physiological BAT activation that has potential clinical implications
for the treatment of obesity and related diseases such as diabetes.

 Author summary
Accumulation of fat in adipose tissue is essential to store energy and insulate the body;
however, excessive body fat leads to obesity. Of the 2 existing types of adipose tissue, white
adipose tissue (WAT) stores energy, whereas brown adipose tissue (BAT) can produce
heat. Activation of BAT and transformation of WAT into brown-like ‘brite/beige’ adipo-
cytes have recently emerged as novel strategies against obesity. The uncoupling protein 1
(UCP1) is a hallmark of BAT and is responsible for triggering these 2 processes under the
regulation of the p38 MAP kinase (p38MAPK) pathway, but the underlying mechanisms
remain unknown. Here, we have analysed this process in detail and demonstrate that a
protein kinase called p38α directly correlates with UCP1 levels in human adipose tissue,
while it inversely correlates with body mass index (BMI). We find that mice lacking p38α
in adipose tissue are protected against diet-induced obesity due to increased body temper-
ature. In addition, another p38 family member, p38δ, is activated in these adipocytes lack-
ing p38α and reduces their thermogenic capacity. Our results suggest that these 2
members of the p38 family have opposite roles in controlling thermogenesis.
Obesity is a serious worldwide health problem, associated with a higher risk of life-threatening
diseases [2], that has had a dramatic increase in prevalence [1]. As the main organ for fat stor-
age, adipose tissue has a fundamental role in metabolism [3]. Whereas white adipose tissue
(WAT) stores energy in the form of triglycerides and releases free fatty acids on demand,
brown adipose tissue (BAT) burns fat to maintain the temperature in a process called non-
shivering thermogenesis [4]. Classically, it was assumed that in adult humans BAT played a
minor role in energy metabolism. However, recent findings have indicated that this tissue can
be modulated by several stimuli presenting lower activity in individuals with obesity [5–7].
Additionally, under certain stimuli, WAT can increase its thermogenic capacity in a process
called browning [8–11]. This remodelling of WAT has acquired special interest because it has
important therapeutic implications in the treatment of obesity [12, 13].
The p38MAPK pathway is activated during browning, and it has been suggested that this
drives adipose tissue remodelling [14, 15]. There are 4 p38 isoforms: p38α, p38β, p38γ, and
p38δ, all of which are activated by stress stimuli in a cell-dependent manner, controlling cellu-
lar fate [16–20]. It has been extensively described that p38MAPK triggers browning and BAT
activation through the transcription of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) via cAMP response ele-
ment-binding (CREB), activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), and peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α (PGC1α) activation. In fact, β-adrenergic stimulation
and other browning agents stimulate the p38MAPK cascade, promoting thermogenesis [18,
21–23]. Although most of these studies assumed that the phenotype is driven by p38α, the spe-
cific role of the isoform p38α and other p38 isoforms in the development and transformation
of adipose tissue has not been elucidated yet using genetically modified mouse models.
Using conditional animals for p38α (p38αFab-KO), unexpectedly, we found that deletion of
this kinase in adipose tissue protected animals against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity
together with increased energy expenditure followed by higher BAT thermogenesis. Lack of
p38α in BAT resulted in higher activation of p38δ. In agreement with this, conditional deletion
of p38δ in adipose tissue led to obesity, with higher body weight and reduced energy expendi-
ture due to a lower body and skin surface temperature in the BAT region. Besides, lack of p38α
in inguinal fat (iWAT) increased p38γ activation and UCP1 expression. Our results indicate

 that p38α controls p38δ activation in BAT, regulating thermogenesis and energy expenditure.
In contrast, in WAT, p38α would have opposite effects depending on the fat depot, blocking
browning through inhibition of p38γ in iWAT and promoting browning in epididymal fat
(eWAT). Thus, these findings challenge the classical view of p38α as an activator of BAT ther-
mogenesis. These studies provided important insights into p38δ and p38α function in BAT
regulation that could have therapeutic implications to efficiently fight obesity.
Results
p38α has emerged as one of the main player that could activate the thermogenic capacity of
adipose tissue. Because the thermogenesis of adipose tissue is reduced in obesity [6, 7, 21], we
wondered whether expression of this kinase changes in human WAT during obesity. Using 2
cohorts for visceral fat and subcutaneous fat (sWAT) of adult patients with 80 and 170 sam-
ples, respectively, we found that the expression of p38α (Mapk14) in visceral fat and sWAT
from individuals with obesity was reduced compared with those without obesity (Fig 1A and
1D). In fact, mRNA levels of Mapk14 in visceral fat inversely correlated with body mass index
(BMI) (Fig 1B). It has been suggested that p38α in WAT activates browning by triggering the
expression of UCP1 [18], the main protein responsible for adipose tissue thermogenic capacity
[22]. In visceral fat and sWAT from individuals with obesity and those without obesity, we
found that expression of Mapk14 correlated positively with the levels of Ucp1 (Fig 1C and 1E).
This correlation reinforced the idea that p38α in visceral fat and sWAT controls the levels of
UCP1 and could regulate browning in humans.
Then, we evaluated the function of p38α in adipose tissue using conditional mice (p38αFab-
KO), which lacked p38α in WAT and BAT (S1 Fig). Under normal-chow diet (ND), p38αFab-
KO mice had the same weight gain as the control Fab-Cre mice (S2A Fig). However, they pre-
sented reduced fat mass, in concordance with lower eWAT, perirenal WAT (pWAT), and
BAT weight (S2B and S2C Fig). This reduction in fat accumulation was associated with higher
energy expenditure and slight increase of body temperature (S2G and S2H Fig). In fact, these
mice presented lower blood glucose levels in fasted and fed conditions (S2D Fig) and increased
glucose tolerance (S2E Fig), with no differences in insulin sensitivity or insulin-stimulated glu-
cose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation in adipose tissue (S2E and S2F Fig). These data
suggest that lack of p38α might protect against type 2 diabetes. Moreover, we evaluated
whether lack of p38α affects adipogenesis, browning, and metabolism in eWAT and BAT.
BAT from p38αFab-KO mice presented an increase of Cidea, a marker of browning, together
with higher expression of glycolytic and β oxidation genes (S3 Fig).
To further evaluate the role of p38α in adipose tissue, mice were fed an HFD, and we
observed that p38αFab-KO mice were completely protected from diet-induced obesity because
their weight was identical to the weight of the control animals in ND (Fig 2A). This reduced
weight gain was in line with lower fat mass (Fig 2B) and reduced weight of the different fat
depots, including eWAT, sWAT, iWAT, pWAT, and BAT (S4A Fig). Moreover, liver weight
was also reduced in agreement with protection against HFD-induced liver steatosis in p38αFab-
KO mice (Fig 2C and S4A Fig). The protection against HFD-induced obesity was associated
with reduced fasted and fed hyperglycaemia in p38αFab-KO mice, with no differences in trigly-
ceridemia (Fig 2D and S4E Fig). In addition, p38αFab-KO mice were protected against HFD-
induced glucose intolerance even when glucose dose was adjusted to lean mass (Fig 2E, S4B
Fig.) and insulin resistance as shown by the reduced glucose levels during the insulin tolerance
test (ITT) (Fig 2E). HFD-induced obesity was associated with liver insulin resistance and
reduced insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in livers from HFD-fed Fab-Cre mice (S4C
Fig). Evaluation of insulin sensitivity in several tissues indicated that HFD-fed p38αFab-KO

 mice presented higher insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 and Ser473 than
HFD-fed Fab-Cre mice in liver and muscle but not in eWAT nor BAT (S4D Fig). Furthermore,
we observed a slight increase of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in eWAT (Fig 2F).
Together, these results demonstrate that p38αFab-KO mice are protected against diet-induced
obesity and diabetes.
Histological analysis showed that interscapular BAT depot from HFD-fed p38αFab-KO mice
had small multilocular adipocytes (Fig 2G), whereas in eWAT, we observed a slight decrease of
adipocyte size (Fig 2G), which correlates to reduced cell size in BAT and WAT adipocytes
from HFD-fed p38αFab-KO with respect to HFD-fed Fab-Cre (S5A and S5C Fig). Then, we eval-
uated HFD-induced WAT adipocyte expansion by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining [23],
observing reduced expansion in p38αFab-KO (Fig 3A). However, no differences in Ki67 staining
were observed after HFD in WAT or BAT adipocytes (S5A and S5C Fig).
To further investigate the mechanism by which lack of p38α in adipose tissue could protect
against HFD-induced obesity, we evaluated whole-body metabolism using metabolic cages.
HFD-fed p38αFab-KO mice showed a significant increase in whole-body energy expenditure
analysed by ANCOVA, with no changes in food intake or respiratory exchange ratio (Fig 3B).
These data are consistent with the observation that HFD-fed p38αFab-KO mice have higher skin
temperature in the region of BAT compared with Fab-Cre mice (Fig 3C). Western blot analysis
of BAT indicated that HFD-fed p38αFab-KO mice presented a slight increase of UCP1 expres-
sion associated with higher AMPK and Creb phosphorylation (Fig 3D and 3E). In addition,
higher expression of UCP1 levels was observed in iWAT from HFD-fed p38αFab-KO mice (S5B
and S7A Figs), suggesting an increased browning of this adipose depot. In contrast with the
up-regulated UCP1 levels in iWAT, analysis of eWAT by western blot and immunohistochem-
istry showed that HFD-fed p38αFab-KO mice have reduced UCP1 levels in this tissue (S6 and
S7B Figs). These results are in agreement with the results found in human visceral fat (Fig 1C)
suggesting that, in visceral fat, p38α directly correlates with UCP1.
In vitro–differentiated brown adipocytes from p38αFab-KO mice confirmed a key role of this
kinase inhibiting browning in a cell-autonomous manner because several browning markers
(UCP1, PGC1b, Cidea, Cox7a1, Cox7a2, and Cox8b) were up-regulated in p38αFab-KO brown
adipocytes (S8A Fig). In concordance with the results observed in the BAT tissue, glycolytic
genes were also up-regulated, while many lipogenic genes that correlated with the lower tri-
glyceride content in p38αFab-KO brown adipocytes were down-regulated (S8B, S8C, S8D and
S8E Fig). In addition, p38αFab-KO brown adipocytes have increased expression of perilipin
with no changes in adiponectin, suggesting same differentiation capacity but smaller and more
abundant lipid droplets (S8B Fig). On the other hand, p38αFab-KO white adipocytes presented
the same in vitro differentiation rate judging by red-oil staining and the expression levels of
adipocyte markers such as adiponectin and perilipin (S8F and S8G Fig). However, p38αFab-KO
white adipocytes have increased expression of leptin (S8F Fig). To further confirm the autono-
mous role of p38α in BAT, we crossed p38α loxP mice with UCP1-Cre mice [24], which
express Cre recombinase specifically in the interscapular brown fat at room temperature, gen-
erating p38αUCP1-KO mice. In agreement with our previous results, these mice were protected
against HFD-induced obesity and presented lower fat mass and increased temperature.

 Furthermore, they had lower blood glucose levels and partial glucose tolerance, indicating that
they were protected against HFD-induced diabetes (Fig 4A–4F).
Our data at 23 ˚C demonstrated that lack of p38α resulted in increased whole-body energy
expenditure due to the activation of BAT and iWAT thermogenesis. At this temperature, BAT
is already fully differentiated; because it is complicated to detect an even higher level of UCP1,
genetic modifications that up-regulate UCP1 levels cannot be easily detected [25]. For this rea-
son, we therefore evaluated p38αFab-KO phenotype in thermoneutrality (30 ˚C) because it has
been suggested to be more similar to the human situation [25]. At 30 ˚C, p38αFab-KO mice
were also protected against HFD-induced obesity (Fig 5A) and presented lower body fat mass
and increased BAT thermogenesis (Fig 5B and 5C), indicating that, even at temperatures at
which BAT is impeded, these mice maintain BAT activation. In fact, UCP1 expression was
much higher in BAT from p38αFab-KO than in the control Fab-Cre mice at 30 ˚C (Fig 5D). In
addition, p38αFab-KO were also protected from HFD-induced diabetes at thermoneutrality (Fig
5E and 5F). Together, these data confirm that lack of p38α protects against HFD-induced obe-
sity and diabetes due to an activation of BAT thermogenesis.
To gain insight into the molecular mechanism that might account for increased UCP1 lev-
els and thermogenic capacity, we studied the signalling in the different adipose tissue depots.
The p38MAPK pathway has been shown to trigger BAT activation in several models [18, 26–
28]. Additionally, it has been found that p38α can inhibit the other p38 isoforms by a negative
feedback loop that blocks the activation of the upstream kinases of this pathway [29]. There-
fore, we evaluated the expression and phosphorylation state of the other p38s, with a phospho-
p38 antibody that recognises all p38 isoforms [30]. Using adipocytes lacking p38γ/δ, we con-
firmed that p38α/β run around 38 kDa, while p38γ/δ run higher—around 41 kDa—allowing
us to distinguish the phosphorylation of these kinases (S9A Fig). Under ND condition, p38δ
and p38γ were hyperactivated in eWAT and iWAT from p38αFab-KO (S9B Fig). In agreement,
p38δ/γ were activated more when cells were treated with sorbitol and p38α inhibitor SB203580
(S9C Fig). HFD resulted in reduced RNA expression of all the p38 isoforms in BAT, while in
eWAT, only p38δ and p38γ decreased (S9D Fig). p38δ and p38γ were hyperactivated in iWAT
and BAT from HFD-fed p38αFab-KO, whereas elevated p38δ (Mapk13) RNA levels were also
found in BAT and eWAT from HFD-fed p38αFab-KO animals (Fig 6A, 6B and S7, S9E and S9F
Figs). Activation of p38δ in BAT was diminished when mice were maintained at 30 ˚C (Fig
6A), suggesting that this p38 isoform might activate BAT thermogenesis. To further evaluate
this hypothesis, mice lacking p38δ in adipose tissue (p38δFab-KO) were generated. In agreement
with the importance of this kinase in BAT activation, p38δFab-KO mice fed with ND presented
higher body weight, associated with increased fat mass and weight of all fat depots (Fig 6C and
6D and S10A Fig). In concordance, p38δFab-KO presented reduced energy expenditure, whole-
body temperature, and decreased BAT thermogenesis (Fig 6E and 6F) as well as lower

 expression levels of Ucp1 and Ppargc1β in BAT (S10B Fig) with no differences in protein kinase
A (PKA) phosphorylation (S10C Fig).
p38δ is activated in BAT upon cold exposure and in adipocytes after stimulation with the
thyroid hormone T3 or norepinephrine (NE) (Fig 6G and 6H), suggesting that this p38 iso-
form might activate BAT thermogenesis. In fact, at 4 ˚C, p38δFab-KO mice have lower body and
skin temperature in the BAT region (Fig 6I). Moreover, HFD-fed p38δFab-KO mice were more
obese with higher fat mass and weight of all fat depots (S11A–S11C Fig). This increased adi-
posity correlated with lower BAT thermogenesis and lower UCP1, Ppargc1a, and Cidea levels
in BAT (S11D–S11F Fig).
Our data indicated that p38δ was triggering thermogenesis because in vitro–differentiated
brown adipocytes lacking p38δ have reduced expression of important genes implicated in BAT
thermogenesis (Ppargc1b, Ppargc1a, Cidea, and Cox8b) and a slight decrease of Ucp1 and
Cox7a1 supporting the cell-autonomous effect of p38δ in BAT thermogenesis (Fig 7A), with
no differences in amount of mitochondrial DNA (Fig 7B and 7C).
Therefore, we evaluated respiration profiles in brown adipocytes lacking p38α and p38δ.
Brown adipocytes lacking p38α presented higher leak respiration after isoproterenol (ISO) or
NE treatment (Fig 7D). However, this augmented respiration capacity induced by NE or ISO
was diminished when p38δ was chemically inhibited by BIRB796, a known inhibitor p38δ
[31], as well as in p38δ-deficient brown adipocytes (Fig 7E and 7F), supporting the important
role of this kinase in brown adipocyte activation.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that p38α in BAT inhibits p38δ activation, which in turn
regulates BAT thermogenesis, energy expenditure, and body weight. We demonstrated that
p38α and p38δ have opposite roles in BAT: whereas p38α inhibits BAT thermogenesis, p38δ
induces it upon several physiological stimuli (Fig 8).
Discussion
Adipose tissue has become an important target for the treatment of obesity, not only because
its dysfunction could be responsible for diabetes development but also because increasing BAT
thermogenesis and/or browning of WAT could lead to new therapeutic approaches against
obesity [32, 33]. In this scenario, p38MAPK signalling has been proposed to be a key activator
of these processes. Consequently, there is an increasing interest to understand the function of
this pathway in the regulation of adipose tissue metabolism, remodelling, and browning.
A growing number of studies have defined p38MAPK as one of the main pathways that
stimulates browning and BAT thermogenesis [18,21–23]. However, using genetically modified
mice lacking specific p38 family members in adipose tissue, we have shown that lack of p38α
in adipose tissue protects against HFD-induced obesity by increasing energy expenditure
through the activation of BAT thermogenesis. Mechanistically, lack of p38α results in hyperac-
tivation of p38δ in BAT together with increased UCP1 expression and higher Creb and AMPK
phosphorylation. Negative feedback controls by p38α through the regulation of upstream acti-
vators of the pathway—such as TAB1 phosphorylation or MKK6 expression—have been

 previously reported [29, 34]. Here, we show that negative control of the pathway by p38α has
biological and pathological implications. However, it would be interesting to examine the epi-
static relationship between p38α and p38δ genetically in future studies.
We also demonstrated that p38δ is activated in BAT by 3 stimuli widely known to activate
this tissue: cold exposure, NE, and thyroid hormone treatment [35, 36], whereas its phosphor-
ylation is reduced under thermoneutrality conditions. In addition, p38δ expression in BAT
was reduced in obese mice, while this down-regulation was ablated in p38αFab-KO mice, sug-
gesting that activation of p38δ in p38αFab-KO mice is responsible for the protection against
diet-induced obesity observed in these mice. Indeed, inhibition of p38δ in p38αFab-KO brown
adipocytes abolished the increased respiratory capacity induced by β3-adrenergic stimuli. In
agreement with the role of p38δ-promoting thermogenesis, mice lacking this kinase in adipose
tissue developed overweight, even in ND, and showed decreased whole-body energy expendi-
ture associated with lower temperature and reduced BAT activation. Moreover, we confirmed
the cell-autonomous role of p38δ inducing browning using differentiated adipocytes.
Our results were completely unexpected because the p38MAPK pathway has been shown to
trigger BAT activation in several models [18, 26–28], and—until now—it was thought that the
only implicated family member was p38α. Moreover, we have recently found that hyperactiva-
tion of p38α in MKK6-deficient animals induces browning of eWAT [37]. These finding
might indicate opposite effects of p38α in eWAT versus iWAT or BAT. While p38α would
activate browning in eWAT—increasing energy expenditure—it would prevent it in iWAT,
and it would block thermogenesis through the negative regulation of p38δ in BAT. In agree-
ment with this hypothesis, we observed reduced levels of UCP1 in epididymal fat lacking
p38α. In fact, our data from human samples indicated that the p38α mRNA levels in visceral
fat directly correlates with UCP1 expression and inversely correlates with the BMI, suggesting
that p38α triggers visceral fat browning. We also found that p38α in sWAT inversely correlates
with UCP1. This is in accordance with results observed in mouse models, in which we found a
decrease of all p38s after HFD in all fat depots. However, the levels of UCP1 expression in
these human fat depots is quite low judging by the low Ct obtained (higher than 29), and evalu-
ation of UCP1 protein expression in human fat depots would be necessary. Moreover, further
studies to determinate the expression of p38 family members and upstream kinases in other
human fat depots would help us to understand the role of these kinases in human adipocytes.
It has been proposed that p38α induces adipogenesis [38–40]. However, using genetically
modified animals, we showed here that lack of p38α in preadipocytes did not affect their differ-
entiation to adipocytes, nor did it affect changes in the differentiation markers evaluated in the
major fat depots. This capacity of cells lacking p38α to still differentiate to adipocytes could be
due to the hyperactivation of the other members of the family: p38γ and p38δ. In fact, it has
been shown that p38 isoforms can compensate for each other [30]. Here, we demonstrated the
cell-autonomous and opposite effects of 2 p38 isoforms in adipocytes, p38α and p38δ. The
cell-specific actions of p38α in each fat depot could be explained by the specific expression pat-
tern of p38 family members—p38α being the main isoform expressed in eWAT, whereas p38δ

 or p38γ are abundant in BAT or iWAT. Furthermore, our results suggest a different regulation
of p38s expression in adipose tissue during obesity, with only decrease of p38δ and p38γ in
eWAT and no effects in p38α or p38β. More studies would be necessary to elucidate the func-
tion of p38γ in adipose tissue.
We also evaluated the controversial role of p38α in GLUT4 translocation [41–43]. Under
ND, insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation was the same in both control and p38αFab-KO mice.
However, p38αFab-KO mice maintained the insulin-induced translocation after the HFD, per-
haps due to the fact that these animals did not gain weight and were protected against diet-
induced insulin resistance. In fact, our data suggest that these mice are more glucose tolerant
using a dose of glucose based on their total body weight.
Due to the potential clinical implications of these results, it would be necessary to further
evaluate the function of each p38 family member in browning to better understand how this
pathway controls adipose tissue metabolism.
In summary, we have demonstrated that p38α and p38δ in adipose tissue have opposite
roles: p38α negatively regulates BAT thermogenesis, energy expenditure, and body weight,
while p38δ induces thermogenesis in BAT in response to several physiological stimuli. These
results have potential clinical implications because inhibition of p38α or activation of p38δ
might be of therapeutic interest against obesity.

surgery at the University Hospital of Salamanca. Patients were excluded if they had a history of
alcohol use disorders or excessive alcohol consumption (>30 g/day in men and >20 g/day in
women) or had chronic hepatitis C or B. Control subjects (n = 13 for visceral fat study; n = 30
for sWAT study) were recruited among patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy
for gallstone disease. Before surgery, fasting venous blood samples were collected for measur-
ing complete cell blood count, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine ami-
notransferase (ALT), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein,
triglycerides, creatinine, glucose, and albumin (S1 and S2 Tables).
Animal models
Mice with a germ-line mutation in Mapk14 (p38α) and Mapk13 (p38δ) have been reported
before [44, 45]. These animals were crossed with Tg (Fabp4-cre)1Rev/J [46] line or B6.FVB-Tg
(Ucp1-cre)1Evdr/J [24] on the C57BL/6J background (Jackson Laboratory) to generate the
mice lacking p38α or p38δ in adipose tissue (both WAT and BAT or just in BAT, respectively).
All mice were maintained on a C57BL/6J background (back-crossed 10 generations). Geno-
type was confirmed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA. Mice were fed with an ND or an HFD,
Research Diets Inc.) for 8 weeks ad libitum. For fat expansion measurement, mice were treated
with BrdU (0.4 mg/ml; Sigma) in the drinking water (water was refreshed every 3 days) during
the first week of a 6-week HFD. For temperature experiments, mice were housed at 30 ˚C for 8
weeks while feeding an HFD in case of thermoneutrality analysis. Mice were exposed to 4 ˚C
for 1 hour, 1 day, or 1 week in case of cold adaptation studies.
Cell culture
Immortalised and primary brown preadipocytes from WT, Fab-Cre, p38αFab-KO, and p38δ-
KO mice were differentiated to brown adipocytes in 10% FCS medium supplemented with 20
nM insulin, 1 nM T3, 125 μM indomethacin, 2 μg/ml dexamethasone, and 50 mM IBMX for
48 hours and maintained with 20 nM of insulin and 1 nM of T3 for 8 days. For some experi-
ments, cultures were incubated with 100 nM T3 for 48 hours before extraction.
Immortalised white preadipocytes from Fab-Cre and p38αFab-KO mice were differentiated
to adipocytes for 9 days in 8% FCS medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin, 25 μg/ml
IBMX, 1 μg/ml dexamethasone, and 1 μM troglitazone. For some experiments, cultures were
incubated with 1 μM NE for 1 hour before extraction.
Analysis of mitochondrial function
Primary brown preadipocytes were plated and differentiated in gelatin-coated (0.1%) 96
seahorse plates. MitoStress oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was assessed in XF medium con-
taining 25 mM glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate using a XF-96 Extra-
cellular Flux Analyzers (Seahorse Bioscience, Agilent Technologies). Cells were stimulated
with following drugs: NE or ISO, oligomycin, FCCP, and antimycin A plus rotenone (1 μM
finally; all from Sigma Aldrich). The protocol for the all drugs followed a 3-minute mix, 2-min-
ute wait, and 3-minute measure cycle that was repeated 3 times. After the analysis, data were
induced OCR. (F) OCR induced by NE and ISO in differentiated brown adipocytes from Fab-Cre and p38αFab-KO mice
was abolished by pretreatment with BIRB796 (10 μM) for 1 hour (mean ± SEM; Fab-Cre n = 6 or p38αFab-KO n = 7 wells
treated with NE; and Fab-Cre n = 7 or p38αFab-KO n = 8 wells treated with ISO). See also S1 Data. BAT, brown adipose

tures were pretreated with 10 μM BIRB796 for 1 hour.
Western blot
Samples were lysed with RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Tris-
Hcl 50 mM [pH 7.5]; Triton X-100 1%; EDTA 1 mM [pH 8]; EGTA 1 mM; NaF 50 mM; β-gly-
cerophosphate-Na 1 mM; sodium pirophosphate 5 mM; orthovanadate-Na 1 mM; sucrose
0.27 M; PMSF 0.1 mM; β-mercaptoethanol 1 mM; aprotinin 10 μg/ml; leupeptin 5 μg/ml).
Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and incubated with antibodies diluted 1/1,000 against
P-Akt308 (Cell Signaling, 9275s), P-Akt473 (Cell Signaling, 9271s), Akt (Cell Signaling,
9272s), UCP1 (Abcam, AB10983), P-ATF2 (Cell Signaling, 9225s), ATF2 (Cell Signaling,
9226s), P-CREB (Cell Signaling, 9198), CREB (Cell Signaling, 4820s), P-p38 (Cell Signaling,
9211s)—which recognises the phosphorylation in the activation sites of all the p38 isoforms—
p38α (Santa Cruz, sc-535), P-AMPKα (Cell Signaling, 2531s), AMPKα (Cell Signaling, 2603s),
P-ACC (Cell Signaling, 3661s), ACC (Cell Signaling, 3676s), PGC1α (Santa Cruz, sc13067),
GAPDH (Santa Cruz, sc25778), tubulin (Sigma, T6199), and vinculin (Sigma, V9131), fol-
lowed by an incubation with a secondary antibody conjugated with HRP. Reactive bands were
detected by chemiluminescence and quantified by Image J software. Specificity of UCP1 anti-
body was evaluated using brown and eWAT from UCP1 KO animals [47].
For the immunoprecipitation assay, cell extracts were incubated with 4 μg of anti-p38 delta
coupled with protein-G-Sepharose. After an overnight incubation at 4˚C, the captured pro-
teins were centrifuged at 10,000 g, the supernatants discarded, and the beads washed 4 times in
lysis buffer. Beads were boiled for 5 minutes at 95 ˚C in 10 μl sample buffer. The antibodies
employed were anti-phospho p38 and anti-p38δ (Santa Cruz, sc7585). Immune complexes
were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (NEN).
Fluorescence-assisted cell sorting
Mouse bone marrow (BM) and spleens were collected, and single-cell suspension was obtained.
Erythrocytes were lysed with a red cell lysis buffer incubation for 3 minutes on ice. Spleen sam-
ples were enriched using CD3 (BioLegend 79751 clone 145-2C11) and B220 (BioLegend 79752
clone RA3-6B2) biotinylated antibodies and magnetic Dynabeads Myone streptavidin T1 (invi-
trogen). Myeloid cells from spleen were labelled by surface staining with FITC-conjugated
CD11b (BioLegend 79749 clone M1/70), PE-conjugated Gr1 (Ly6G/Ly6C) (BDBioscience 79750
clone RB6-8C5), and APC-conjugated F4/80 (eBiosciences 25-4801-82 clone BM8) antibodies,
and myeloid cells from BM were labelled by FITC-conjugated Gr1 (Ly6G/Ly6C) (Invitrogen 11-
5931-82 clone RB6-8C5), PE-conjugated CD115 (eBioscience 12-1152-82 clone AFS98), and
APC-conjugated F4/80 (eBiosciences 25-4801-82 clone BM8) antibodies. Nuclei were stained
with DAPI. Cells were sorted with a fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS) Aria (BD) as fol-
lows: spleen macrophages (Gr1− Cd11bmedium F4/80+), spleen neutrophils (Gr1high Cd11b+), and
BM monocytes (CD115+ F4/80−). Isolated myeloid cells were lysed and analysed by western blot.
GTT
Overnight-starved mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 g/kg of body weight of glucose,
and blood glucose levels were quantified with an Ascensia Breeze 2 glucose meter at 0, 15, 30,
60, 90, and 120 minutes post injection. Alternatively, GTT was performed injecting intraperi-
toneally 1 g/kg of lean mass of glucose.

 ITT
ITT was performed by injecting intraperitoneally 0.75 IU/kg of insulin at mice starved for 1
hour and detecting blood glucose levels with a glucometer at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes
post injection.
Indirect calorimetry system
Energy expenditure, respiratory exchange, and food intake were quantified using the indirect
calorimetry system (TSE LabMaster, TSE Systems, Germany) for 3 days.
Temperature
Body temperature was detected by a rectal thermometer (AZ 8851 K/J/T Handheld Digital
Thermometer-Single, AZ Instruments Corp., Taiwan).
BAT-adjacent interscapular temperature was quantified by thermographic images using a
FLIR T430sc Infrared Camera (FLIR Systems, Inc., Wilsonville, OR) and analysed through
FlirIR software.
Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis
Body, fat, and lean mass were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance (Whole Body Compo-
sition Analyzer; EchoMRI, Houston, TX) and analysed by ImageJ software.
Triglyceride measurement
Blood triglyceride content was quantified using a Dimension RxL Max analyser (Siemens). For
triglyceride analysis in cells, brown adipocyte cultures were lysed in isopropanol, centrifuged
at 10,000 g for 15 minutes at 4 ˚C, and triglycerides were detected in the supernatant with a
commercial kit (Sigma).
DNA isolation
Brown adipocyte cells were scraped in PBS and pellet lysed in TNES buffer supplemented with
Proteinase K (20 mg/ml) overnight at 55 ˚C. Reaction was stopped with sodium chloride 6 M
and samples centrifuged 5 minutes at 13,000 g. DNA was precipitated in supernatants with
100% ethanol and washed with 70% ethanol. After drying, DNA was resuspended in DNase
free water, quantified, and analysed by RT-PCR. Mitochondrial DNA was detected using
primers for COII and nuclear DNA, using primers for Sdh1 (S3 Table).
qRT-PCR
RNA 500ng—extracted with RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Quiagen) following manufacturer instruc-
tions—was transcribed to cDNA, and qRT-PCR was performed using Fast Sybr Green probe
(Applied Biosystems) and the appropriated primers in the 7900 Fast Real Time thermocycler
(Applied Biosystems). Relative mRNA expression was normalised to Gapdh mRNA measured
in each sample. Primers used are listed in S3 Table.
Histology staining
Fresh livers, brown, and epididymal white fat were fixed with formalin 10%, included in paraf-
fin, and cut in 5 μm slides followed by a haematoxylin–eosin staining.
Fat droplets were detected by oil red staining (0.7% in propylenglycol) in 8 mm slides
included in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek) and in differentiated brown and white adipocytes.

 Immunostaining
Brown adipocytes were stained with Mito Tracker Deep Red (Invitrogen) and Bodipy (Invitro-
gen). Images were captured using Leica SPE confocal microcope (Leica Microsystems, Wet-
zlar, Germany).
For UCP1 immunostaining, brown and epididymal white fat were fixed with formalin 10%,
included in paraffin, cut in 5 μm slides, and sequentially stained with a UCP1 antibody (1/500,
Abcam, AB10983), a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1/500, Jackson
Immuno Research Laboratories), a streptavidin-conjugated ABC complex (Vector Laborato-
ries), and the substrate 3,3’-diaminobenzidene conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Vec-
tor Laboratories), followed by brief counterstaining with Nuclear Fast Red haematoxylin
(Sigma).
For immunofluorescence analysis, the 5 μm tissue sections were deparaffinised and rehy-
drated, followed by antigen retrieval in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0) under pressure in a
CertoClav EL (CertoClav Sterilizer GmbH). For BrdU staining, sections were treated with
DNase 30 minutes at 37 ˚C. Blocking and staining was performed in 5% BSA in PBS. Sections
were incubated in primary antibodies including rat-anti-Ki67 (eBioscience, 14-5698-82; clone:
SolA15) (1:100), rabbit-anti-GLUT4 (Abcam, ab654) (1:1000), mouse-anti-Caveolin-1 (Sigma,
SAB4200216) (1:500), rat anti-BrdU (Abcam, Ab6326; clone: BU1/75 [ICR1]) (1:200), and rab-
bit anti-Perilipin (Cell Signaling, 9349; clone: D1D8) (1:400) overnight at 4 ˚C. Secondary anti-
bodies including goat anti-rabbit-A488, goat anti-rat-A647, and chicken anti-mouse-A647—
all used at 1:500—were purchased from Molecular Probes and incubated with tissue for 1 hour
at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with DAPI, and slides were mounted with Vecta-
shield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and examined using SP5 multi-line inverted
confocal microscope. Several confocal images of each tissue section were acquired and ana-
lysed for the translocation of GLUT4 or the presence of Ki67 or BrdU in adipocyte nuclei.
BAT and WAT cellularity were quantified using Fiji software. Adipocyte nuclei were identified
by their location inside adipocyte membranes as described [23].
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was evaluated by student t test and
2-way ANOVA coupled with Bonferroni’s post-tests with values of p < 0.05 considered signifi-
cant. When variances were different, Welch’s test was used. For human studies, variables were
compared by means of Mann-Whitney U test or χ2 test.

HFD, related to Fig 6. Fab-Cre and p38δFab-KO mice were fed with an HFD for 8 weeks. (a)
Body weight at the end of the treatment (mean ± SEM, Fab-Cre n = 8 mice; p38δFab-KO n = 7
mice). (b) NMR analysis of body mass and fat mass in p38δFab-KO and Fab-Cre mice after 8
weeks of HFD (mean ± SEM, Fab-Cre n = 8 mice; p38δFab-KO n = 7 mice). (c) Weight of
eWAT, sWAT, iWAT, pWAT, BAT, and liver with respect to tibia length (mean ± SEM, Fab-
Cre n = 8 mice; p38δFab-KO n = 7 mice). (d) Skin temperature surrounding interscapular BAT
in HFD-fed Fab-Cre and p38δFab-KO. Right panels show representative infrared thermal
images (mean ± SEM, Fab-Cre n = 8 mice; p38δFab-KO n = 7 mice). (e) qRT-PCR analysis of
mRNA expression of browning genes in BAT isolated from HFD-fed Fab-Cre and p38δFab-KO
mice. mRNA expression was normalized to the amount of Gapdh mRNA (mean ± SEM, Fab-
Cre n = 5 mice; p38δFab-KO n = 6 mice). (f) Immunoblot of UCP1 protein levels in p38δFab-KO
and Fab-Cre mice after 8 weeks of HFD. Quantification is shown on the right panel (mean ±
SEM, Fab-Cre n = 5 mice; p38δFab-KO n = 6 mice). �p < 0.05; ��p < 0.01; ���p < 0.001; Fab-Cre
