Abstract
Interruption of combination antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1-infected individuals leads to rapid viral 
rebound. Here we report the results of a phase IIa open label clinical trial evaluating 3BNC117, a 
broad and potent neutralizing antibody (bNAb) against the CD4 binding site of HIV-1 Env1, in the 
setting of analytical treatment interruption in 13 HIV-1-infected individuals. Participants with 
3BNC117-sensitive virus outgrowth cultures were enrolled. Two or four 30 mg kg−1 infusions of 
3BNC117, separated by 3 or 2 weeks, respectively, are generally well tolerated. Infusions are 
associated with a delay in viral rebound for 5–9 weeks after two infusions, and up to 19 weeks 
after four infusions, or an average of 6.7 and 9.9 weeks respectively, compared with 2.6 weeks for 
historical controls (P < 0.00001). Rebound viruses arise predominantly from a single provirus. In 
most individuals, emerging viruses show increased resistance, indicating escape. However, 30% of 
participants remained suppressed until antibody concentrations waned below 20 μg ml−1, and the 
viruses emerging in all but one of these individuals showed no apparent resistance to 3BCN117, 
suggesting failure to escape over a period of 9–19 weeks. We conclude that administration of 
3BNC117 exerts strong selective pressure on HIV-1 emerging from latent reservoirs during 
analytical treatment interruption in humans.
A fraction of HIV-1 infected individuals develops broad and potent serologic activity against 
the virus. Single-cell antibody cloning methods2 have uncovered the source of this activity 
as broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), which target different sites on the HIV-1 
envelope spike protein, gp1601–3.
In animal models, bNAbs show potent prophylactic activity, suppress established viraemia, 
and delay viral rebound during analytical treatment interruption (ATI)4–8. In humans, a 
phase I clinical trial showed that 3BNC117 is generally safe and effective in transiently 
reducing viraemia in chronically HIV-1-infected individuals9. A single infusion of 3BNC117 
was well tolerated, rapidly decreased viral loads in viraemic individuals by an average of 
1.48 log10 copies per ml, with durable activity for 4 weeks9. In addition, 3BNC117 
increased autologous antibody responses in HIV-1-infected individuals, and enhanced 
clearance of infected cells in humans and in humanized mice10,11. VRC01, a less potent 
bNAb that also targets the CD4-binding site, suppressed viraemia by 1.14 log10 (refs 12,13 
and Fig. 1a, b).

 To investigate whether 3BNC117 can suppress viral rebound from the latent reservoir during 
ATI in chronically suppressed HIV-1 infected humans, we conducted a phase IIa open label 
clinical trial. To select participants with 3BNC117-sensitive viruses in their latent reservoirs, 
we performed bulk viral outgrowth cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
from individuals whose viraemia was suppressed by combination antiretroviral therapy 
(ART). The resulting isolates were screened for sensitivity to 3BNC117 using the TZM-bl 
assay (Supplementary Table 1). Of 63 individuals screened, only 11% yielded viruses that 
were fully resistant to 3BNC117 (IC50 > 20 μg/ml), and 65% were sensitive to 3BNC117 
IC50 at concentrations below 2.0 μg/ml. In contrast only 29% were similarly sensitive to 
VRC01 (Fig. 1a and b, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1).
We enrolled HIV-1 infected individuals who were on suppressive antiretroviral therapy 
(ART) with plasma viral loads <50 HIV-1 RNA copies per ml for at least 12 months, had 
CD4 counts >500 cells per mm3, yielded 3BNC117-sensitive outgrowth viruses (IC50 ≤ 2.0 
μg ml−1), and whose viral load at screen was <20 copies per ml (Extended Data Fig. 1, 
Supplementary Tables 2 and 4, and Methods). Participants were enrolled in two groups: 
eightin group A to receive two 30 mg kg−1 infusions three weeks apart, while seven in group 
B received up to four 30 mg kg−1 infusions at two-week intervals (Fig. 1c, d, Supplementary 
Table 2). Two group A participants had viral loads >20 copies per ml at the time of infusion 
and were excluded from further analysis (Supplementary Tables 2 and 4).Participants are 
numbered 701–715 (Supplementary Table 2).
ATI was started 2 days after the first 3BNC117 infusion. ART was reinitiated and infusions 
were stopped after two consecutive plasma viral load measurements exceeded 200 copies 
per ml. All individuals on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) were 
switched to an integrase-inhibitor-based regimen (dolutegravir plus tenoforvir disoproxil 
fumarate/emtricitabine) four weeks before ATI owing to the long half-life of NNRTIs 
(Supplementary Table 2).
Both dosing regimens were generally well tolerated. The majority of reported adverse events 
were transient and grade 1 in severity (Supplementary Table 5). The mean CD4 T-cell count 
at baseline (day 0) was 747 cells per mm3, and the average change in CD4 T-cell counts 
between start of ATI and rebound was −127 cells per mm3. Although CD4T cells declined 
modestly during viral rebound in some participants, CD4 T-cells returned to baseline by 
week 12 in most participants (mean 828 cells per mm3) (Extended Data Fig. 2 and 
Supplementary Table 4). Of 12 individuals tested, 5 showed measurable increases in the 
magnitude and/or breadth of T cell responses to HIV-1 12 weeks after ATI, relative to 
baseline (Extended Data Fig. 3). None of the participants experienced acute retroviral 
syndrome during rebound, and viraemia was re-suppressed below 20 copies per ml in all 
participants within 2–7 weeks after restarting ART (Supplementary Table 4). We conclude 
that up to four 30 mg kg−1 infusions of 3BNC117 during ATI are generally safe and well 
tolerated.
By anti-idiotype ELISA9 the half-life of 3BNC117 during ATI was 19.6 days among group 
A participants, and 14.1 days among those in group B (Fig. 1e, f and Supplementary Table

 4). These measurements are similar to previously reported values for 3BNC117 in HIV-1-
infected individuals on ART9 (Fig. 1e).
All six group A participants maintained viral loads below 200 copies per ml during the first 
4 weeks, with rebound 5–9 weeks after ART interruption (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 
4a). In group B, rebound occurred 3–19 weeks after ATI, with four out of seven (57%) 
participants remaining suppressed for at least 10 weeks (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 
4b). The average time to rebound was 6.7 weeks in group A, 9.9 weeks in group B, and 8.4 
weeks for all participants together, compared with 2.6 weeks for matched historical non-
infused control individuals (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 4a, Supplementary Tables 4, 6 and 
7). Altogether, 6 of the 13 infused individuals (46%) remained suppressed until at least 9 
weeks after ATI. Relative to matched historical control individuals, the delay to rebound 
among all 3BNC117-infused participants was highly significant (P < 0.00001, weighted log-
rank test, Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 4, Supplementary Tables 4, 6 and 7 and Methods). We 
conclude that repeated infusions of 3BNC117 are generally safe and significantly delay 
HIV-1 rebound from the latent reservoir during ATI.
Time to viral rebound did not correlate with pre-ATI viral culture sensitivity to 3BNC117, 
nor to baseline levels of cell-associated HIV-1 DNA (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 4e). 
Therefore the significance of viral outgrowth sensitivity as an inclusion criterion is not clear. 
3BNC117 levels at rebound were also variable, ranging from 6–168 μg ml−1, but were 
directly correlated to the IC80 of the emerging virus (Fig. 2a, b, e)
To determine whether rebound was associated with resistance to 3BNC117, we compared 
pre-infusion and rebound viral outgrowth cultures. A majority (8/13) of participants had 
rebound viruses that were more resistant to 3BNC117 (IC80 > threefold higher, Fig. 3a, c, 
Extended Data Fig. 5a, Supplementary Table 3). Among group A participants, all but one 
(707) had more resistant rebound viruses; however, among group B participants, four of 
seven (710, 711, 712 and 715) showed similar pre-infusion and rebound sensitivity to 
3BNC117 (Fig. 3a, c, Extended Data Fig. 5a, Supplementary Table 3). Among these five 
individuals, 711 was the earliest to rebound at 3 weeks, despite having viruses that were 
surprisingly sensitive to 3BNC117 as measured by IC50 (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 5a, 
Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). However, 100% neutralization was not achieved against 711 
rebound or pre-infusion viruses, even at high (50 μg ml−1) antibody concentrations, 
suggesting that 3BNC117 was not fully therapeutic (Extended Data Fig. 5, Supplementary 
Table 3). Thus, the only participant in the study to rebound within 3 weeks of ATI may have 
done so because of pre-existing resistance to 3BNC117 by the dominant virus in the 
reservoir.
The other 4 participants that showed no change between pre- and post-infusion culture 
sensitivity to 3BNC117, 707, 710, 712, and 715, rebounded relatively late at 9, 19, 16 and 11 
weeks after ATI, respectively (Figs 2a, b, 3a, c, Extended Data Fig. 5, Supplementary Tables 
3 and 4). In all of these individuals rebound was associated with relatively low antibody 
concentrations ranging from 6–41 μg ml−1 (mean 19.7 μg ml−1). This antibody concentration 
represents 9.6-fold the mean IC80 for the rebounding viruses, which is consistent with 
previous reports on the relationship between suppressive 3BNC117 concentration and

 neutralization titre in macaques14 (Fig. 2, Extended Data Fig. 5, Supplementary Tables 3 and 
4).
To determine whether viral rebound during ATI was associated with resistance to other 
bNAbs undergoing clinical testing, we examined sensitivity to 10-1074 (ref. 15), which 
targets a different and non-overlapping epitope on the HIV-1 trimer (Fig. 3b, d, Extended 
Data Fig. 5, and Supplementary Table 3). With the exception of 703 and 711, the 
participants' rebound cultures did not show increased resistance to 10-1074. We conclude 
that rebound during ATI in the presence of 3BNC117 is infrequently associated with 
increased resistance to 10-1074.
To characterize viruses emerging from the latent reservoir further, we performed single 
genome sequencing (SGS) of viral RNA from the plasma and viral outgrowth cultures from 
eight individuals. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences indicated that all of these eight 
trial participants were infected with epidemiologically unrelated viruses (Extended Data Fig. 
6). Given the limited sampling of the pre-infusion reservoir, rebound viruses did not always 
fall within the radiation of pre-infusion viral isolates (Fig. 3e, f, Extended Data Figs 7 and 8, 
Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).
Remarkably, in five of eight participants, all rebounding virus sequences clustered within a 
low diversity lineage, consistent with the clonal expansion of a single recrudescent virus 
(Fig. 3e, f, Extended Data Figs 7 and 8, Supplementary Table 8). These data contrast with 
individuals undergoing ATI in the absence of antibody infusion, where virus rebound is 
consistently polyclonal, indicating the activation of multiple latently infected cells16–19. 
Thus, in addition to delaying rebound, 3BNC117 appears to restrict the outgrowth of viral 
genotypes from the latent reservoir.
Six of eight participants sequenced had rebound viral outgrowth culture and/or plasma 
sequences that indicated 3BNC117 resistance. For example, in 704, all rebound viruses 
carried a serine at position 456 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figs 1 and 2), which may disrupt 
a highly conserved salt bridge that maintains the V5 loop's position and conformation20–22. 
Similarly, in 708 and 709, nearly all rebound viruses carried atypical residues at position 
282, where a lysine residue typically forms a salt bridge with 3BNC117 (Fig. 4a and 
Supplementary Figs 1 and 2)23. However, documented 3BNC117 resistance mutations24 
were not universally identified among rebound viral strains (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figs 
1 and 2). Only a minor fraction (3 of 23) of sequences in the rebound population of 
participant 701 had potential resistance-conferring residues in Loop D (274F, 282R), while 
the remaining sequences did not (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figs 1 and 2). Similarly, in 702 
and 703, only a subset of rebound viruses carried a putative resistance-conferring A281D 
change1,23. Nevertheless, the frequency of this change increased markedly with time in both 
participants, indicating continued selection for 3BNC117 resistance (Fig. 4a and 
Supplementary Figs 1 and 2). For participants 707 and 711, no sequence features were 
identified that would indicate 3BNC117 resistance.
To determine the sensitivity of rebound viruses to 3BNC117, we performed TZM-bl 
neutralization assays using pseudoviruses typed with SGS Env genotypes (Fig. 4b, Extended

 Data Figs 7 and 8, Supplementary Figs 1 and 2 and Supplementary Table 9). With the 
exception of participant 707, who rebounded 9 weeks after ATI at very low 3BNC117 titres, 
Env genotypes at rebound were more resistant to 3BNC117 than pre-ATI (Fig. 4b, Extended 
Data Figs 7 and 8 and Supplementary Table 9). We conclude that viral rebound during ATI 
in the presence of 3BNC117 selects for the emergence of resistant variants, indicating strong 
selection pressure by this antibody on viral populations arising from the reservoir.
Antibody potency and half-life are directly correlated with HIV-1 prophylaxis in pre-clinical 
models. For example, VRC01, a CD4bs antibody that is less potent than 3BNC1171, is less 
effective than 3BNC117 in preventing SHIVAD8 infection in macaques8,25. Consistent with 
these observations, clinical trials with combinations of three less-potent first-generation 
bNAbs showed limited effects on viral rebound in the setting of ATI in chronically infected 
individuals26,27. In addition, selective pressure as evidenced by escape mutations was only 
observed for one of the three antibodies used in the combination, 2G1226,27. In contrast, 
3BNC117 alone significantly delayed viral rebound with nearly half of all individuals 
remaining below 200 copies per ml until at least 9 weeks, including four individuals who 
failed to develop resistance and only rebounded at low antibody concentrations. We 
speculate that the difference in efficacy between 3BNC117 and less potent bNAbs in the 
setting of ATI is due to increased potency and/or a longer half-life1,9,13.
Nevertheless, the majority of the individuals we studied rebounded at high 3BNC117 serum 
concentrations. A single viral genotype displaying increased resistance to 3BNC117 
established rebound in most cases. These viruses represent pre-existing dormant variants that 
emerged from the latent reservoir. The time to rebound did not correlate with the amount of 
viral DNA in circulating PBMCs; however, this is a poor measure of the HIV-1 reservoir, 
since most integrated proviruses in patients on ART are defective28. Instead, the delay in 
viral rebound may represent a measure of the frequency of 3BNC117-resistant variants in 
the latent reservoir.
Combinations of drugs are needed to maintain HIV-1 suppression in effective ART 
regimens. Similarly, combinations of antibodies were required to suppress viraemia in 
humanized mice6,7. We speculate that combinations of bNAbs will also be needed to 
increase the frequency of individuals that remain suppressed by antibody during ATI.
Whether 3BNC117 can also impact the size and composition of the latent reservoir during 
ATI will require additional studies.
Methods
Study design
An open-label, dose-escalation phase 2a study was conducted in HIV-1-infected participants 
(http://www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT02446847). Study participants were enrolled sequentially 
according to eligibility criteria. Group A received 3BNC117 on days 0 and 21 at a dose of 
30 mg/kg body weight at a rate of 250 ml/hour. Group B received 3BNC117 on days 0, 14, 
28 and 42 at a dose of 30 mg/kg, as long as viral rebound did not occur. Antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) was discontinued 2 days after the first 3BNC117 infusion (day 2). Plasma

 HIV-1 RNA levels were monitored weekly, and ART was resumed when viral load increased 
to ≥200 c.p.m. in two consecutive weekly measurements.
Study participants were followed for 36 weeks after the first infusion. Safety data are 
reported until week 36 for participants enrolled in group A and until week 14 for participants 
enrolled in group B. All participants provided written informed consent before participation 
in the study and the study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice. The 
protocol was approved by the Federal Drug Administration in the USA and the Institutional 
Review Board at the Rockefeller University.
Study participants
All study participants were recruited at the Rockefeller University Hospital, New York, 
USA. Eligible participants were adults aged 18–65 years, HIV-1-infected and before 
enrolment had plasma HIV-1 RNA levels <50 c.p.m. for at least 12 months while on 
combination ART and <20 c.p.m. at the screening visit, and current CD4 count >500/μl. In 
addition, participant-derived HIV-1 isolates produced by co-culture of participant PBMCs 
with HIV-uninfected donor PBMCs were required to be neutralized by 3BNC117 with an 
IC50 <2 μg/ml in TZM-bl neutralization assays, as previously described31. An IC50 of <2 
ug/ml was chosen as a cut-off based on previous PK data of 3BNC117 in humans9 and data 
in macaques showing that antibody levels 10–100 times the IC50 value against infecting viral 
strains are necessary to control viral rebound14. However, given the limited diversity and 
representation of the latent reservoir in outgrowth cultures (Supplementary Fig. 2) and the 
fact that no correlation between pre-infusion IC50 and delay of viral rebound was found in 
this study, the significance of this criterion is unclear. Participants on an NNRTI-based ART 
regimen were switched to a study-provided integrase-inhibitor-based regimen (dolutegravir 
(Tivicay, ViiV Pharmaceuticals) + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (Truvada, 
Gilead Sciences) 4 weeks before treatment interruption due to the prolonged half-life of 
NNRTIs. Exclusion criteria included history of CD4 nadir <200 cells/μl, concomitant 
hepatitis B or C infections, previous receipt of a monoclonal antibody of any kind, or 
clinically relevant physical findings, medical conditions or laboratory abnormalities. 
Pregnant and breastfeeding women were not eligible.
Historical controls (ACTG trial participants)
Viral rebound data from 52 participants who participated in four ACTG ATI studies without 
additional interventions (ACTG 37132, A502433, A506834, and A519732) were compared 
with viral rebound data in this study. Historical controls were selected based on similar 
inclusion criteria: age 18–65, Plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c.p.m. for at least 12 months before 
ATI while on combination ART, CD4 count at time of ATI >500 cells/μl, CD4 nadir >200 
cells/μl, weekly viral load measurements at least until viral rebound occurred.
Study procedures
The appropriate volume of 3BNC117 was calculated according to body weight, diluted in 
sterile normal saline to a total volume of 250 ml, and administered intravenously over 60 
min. Study participants received 3BNC117 on days 0 and 21, or 0, 14, 28, and 42 and 
remained under monitoring at the Rockefeller University Hospital for 4 h after each

 infusion. Participants returned for frequent follow up visits for safety assessments, which 
included physical examination, measurement of clinical laboratory parameters such as 
haematology, chemistries, urinalysis, and pregnancy tests (for women). Plasma HIV-1 RNA 
levels were monitored weekly during the ATI period and CD4 counts were measured every 
other week (Supplementary Table 4). Study investigators evaluated and graded adverse 
events according to the DAIDS AE Grading Table and determined causality. Blood samples 
were collected before and at multiple times after 3BNC117 infusions. Samples were 
processed within 4 h of collection, and serum and plasma samples were stored at −80 °C. 
PBMCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. The absolute number of peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells was determined by an automated cell counter (Vi-Cell XR; 
Beckman Coulter), and cells were cryopreserved in fetal bovine serum plus 10% DMSO.
ART re-initiation criteria
Antiretroviral therapy was discontinued 2 days after the first 3BNC117 infusion (day 2). 
ART was re-initiated when HIV-1 RNA levels were found to be ≥200 c.p.m. and/or CD4 T 
cell counts decreased to <350 cells/μl and the result was confirmed with a repeat 
measurement.
Plasma HIV-1 RNA Levels
HIV-1 RNA levels in plasma were measured at the time of screening (within 49 days before 
the first infusion), day 0 (before infusion), and weekly until week 12, then at weeks 14, 24 
and 36. Participants that remained virologically suppressed to <20 c.p.m. off ART beyond 
week 12, returned for weekly measurements of plasma HIV-1 RNA levels. HIV-1 RNA 
levels were determined using the Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Assay, 
Version 2.0, which detects between 20 and 1 × 107 c.p.m. This assay was performed at 
LabCorp.
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were determined at screening, on day 0 (before infusion), and 
weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 36 by a clinical flow cytometry assay, performed at 
LabCorp. Cells were analysed by flow cytometry. Leukocytes were determined as CD45+ 
cells. Percentage of cells positively stained for CD3, CD4, CD8 as well as the CD4/CD8 
ratio were analysed with the BD Multiset software (BD Biosciences).
3BNC117 study drug
3BNC117 is a recombinant, fully human IgG1κ mAb recognizing the CD4 binding site on 
the HIV-1 envelope1. The antibody was cloned from an HIV-1-infected viraemic controller 
in the International HIV Controller Study1,35, expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells 
(clone 5D5-5C10), and purified using standard methods. The 3BNC117 drug substance was 
produced at Celldex Therapeutics Fall River (MA) GMP facility, and the drug product was 
fill-finished at Gallus BioPharmaceuticals (NJ). The resulting purified 3BNC117 was 
supplied as a single use sterile 20 mg/ml solution for intravenous injection in 8.06 mM 
sodium phosphate, 1.47 mM potassium phosphate, 136.9 mM sodium chloride, 2.68 mM

 potassium chloride, and 0.01% polysorbate 80. 3BNC117 vials were shipped and stored at 
4°C.
Measurement of 3BNC117 serum levels
Serum levels of 3BNC117 were determined by a validated sandwich ELISA at Celldex 
Theapeutics as described previously9. Plates (Sigma-Aldrich PN: CLS3590 96-well, High 
Bind, polystyrene) were coated with 4 μg/ml of an anti-idiotypic antibody specifically 
recognizing 3BNC117 (anti-ID 1F1 mAb), and incubated overnight at 2–8 °C. After 
washing, plates were blocked for 1 h with 5% BSA. Serum samples, QCs and standards 
were added (1:50 minimum dilution in 5% BSA) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. 
3BNC117 was detected using an HRP-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG kappa chain 
specific antibody (Abcam PN: ab79115) and the HRP substrate tetra-methylbenzidine. 
3BNC117 concentrations were then interpolated from a standard curve of 3BNC117 using a 
four-parameter logistic curve-fitting algorithm. The reference standard and positive controls 
were created from the drug product lot of 3BNC117 used in the clinical study.
Pharmacokinetic analysis
Blood samples were collected immediately before and at the end of infusions as well as on 
the day after infusion, weekly during the ATI period and at weeks 14, 24 and 36. 3BNC117 
serum levels were measured by ELISA (Celldex Therapeutics).
Neutralization assay
Serum samples, viral supernatants, and control antibodies were tested against HIV-1 
envelope pseudoviruses as previously described36,37.
Cell-associated HIV-1 DNA
Participant's CD4+ T-cells were isolated from 10 million cryopreserved PBMCs by negative 
magnetic selection (Miltenyi). Total DNA was extracted and quantitative PCR performed 
using pol- and CCR5-directed primers as previously described7.
Virus cultures
Autologous virus was retrieved from HIV-1 infected individuals as previously described31. 
Briefly, healthy donor PBMCs were obtained by leukapheresis from a single donor. Cells 
were cultured at a concentration of 5 × 106/ml in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium 
(IMDM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Thermo 
Scientific), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and 1 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA; 
Life Technologies) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After 2–3 days, 5 × 106 CD8+ depleted cells were 
transferred into IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 5 μg/ml 
polybrene (Sigma), and 100 U/ml of IL-2. Cells were then co-incubated with 4–8 × 106 
CD4+ T cells from the study participants and 10 million irradiated healthy donor PBMCs 
that had been cultured together for 24 h prior in IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% 
penicillin/streptomycin, 100 U/ml IL-2 and 1 μg/ml PHA at 37°C and 5% CO2. 
Lymphoblasts were replenished weekly by adding 3 million healthy donor PHA stimulated 
CD8+ depleted lymphoblasts. Culture supernatants were quantified using the Alliance HIV-1

 p24 Antigen ELISA kit (PerkinElmer) according to the manufacturer's instructions. TCID50s 
were determined for all HIV-1 containing supernatants36,37 and then tested for sensitivity 
against 3BNC117 and other bNAbs in a TZM.bl neutralization assay. Blood samples and 
leukapheresis were collected under separate IRB-approved protocols and after volunteers 
provided informed consent.
Sequence analysis
HIV-1 RNA extraction and single genome amplification was performed as described 
previously38. In detail, HIV-1 RNA was extracted from plasma samples using the Qiagen 
MinElute Virus Spin kit (Qiagen) followed by first strand cDNA synthesis using SuperScript 
III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and the antisense primer env3out 5′-
TTGCTACTTGTGATTGCTCCATGT-3′. gp160 env was amplified using envB5out 5′-
TAGAGCCCTGGAAGCATCCAGGAAG-3′ and envB3out 5′-
TTGCTACTTGTGATTGCTCCATGT-3′ in the first round and second round nested primers 
envB5in 5′-CACCTTAGGCATCTCCTATGGCAGGAAGAAG-3′ and envB3in 5′-
GTCTCGAGATACTGCTCCCACCC-3′. PCRs were performed using a High Fidelity 
Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) at 94 °C, 2 min; (94 °C, 15 s; 55 °C 30 s; 68 °C, 4 min) × 35; 
68°C, 15 min. Second round PCR was performed with 1 μl of first PCR product as template 
and High Fidelity Platinum Taq at 94 °C, 2 min; (94 °C, 15 s; 55 °C 30 s; 68 °C, 4 min) × 
35; 68 °C, 15 min. Sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees and mutation analysis of gp160 
was performed by using Geneious Pro software, version 8.1.6 (Biomatters Ltd.)39. Sequence 
analysis was performed using Antibody database by A. West30. Logograms were generated 
using the Weblogo 3.0 tool40.
Pseudovirus generation
Selected SGS from virus culture supernatants and plasma were used to generate 
pseudoviruses and tested for sensitivity to bNAbs in a TZM.bl assay41. To produce the 
pseudoviruses, plasmid DNA containing the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was 
amplified by PCR using forward primer 5′-GTTGACATTGATTATTGACTAG and reverse 
primer 5′-CTTCCTGCCATAGGAGATGCCTAAAGCTCTGCTTATATAGAC-CTC. The 
CMV promoter amplicon was fused to individual env SGS amplicons by PCR using forward 
primer 5′-AGTAATCAATTACGGGGTCATTAGTTCAT and reverse primer 5′-
ACTTTTTGACCACTTGCCACCCAT. Fusion PCR was carried out using the Expand Long 
Template PCR System (Roche) in a 60μl reaction consisting of 1 ng purified CMV promoter 
amplicon, 0.125 μl unpurified env SGA amplicon, 200 nM forward and reverse primers, 200 
μM dNTP mix, 1 × Buffer 1, and 1 μl DNA polymerase mix. PCR was run at 94 °C for 2 
min; 25 cycles (94 °C for 12 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for four minutes); and 72 °C for 10 
min. Resulting amplicons were analysed by gel electrophoresis, purified without gel 
extraction, and co-transfected with pSG3Δenv into HEK293T cells to produce pseudoviruses 
as described previously41.
Statistical analyses
Adverse events were summarized by the number of participants who experienced the event, 
by severity grade according to the DAIDS AE Grading Table and by relationship to 
3BNC117 as determined by the investigator. PK-parameters were estimated by performing a

 non-compartmental analysis (NCA) using WinNonlin 6.3. Kaplan–Meier survival curves 
were used to compare time to rebound in trial participants to participants in previous ATI 
studies conducted by ACTG29. To exclude the possibility that the observed delay in rebound 
is confounded by clinical factors, we compared the clinical variables between the control 
(ACTG trial participants) and treated group using a two-sided Fisher's Exact test for 
categorical variables (gender and CD4 Nadir) and an unpaired Wilcoxon test (two-sided) for 
continuous variables (age, years on ART and CD4 count before ATI initiation) 
(Supplementary Table 7). Additionally, we tested for each potential confounder whether the 
variable is predictive for the rebound time. Therefore, we built a univariate survival 
regression model for each potential confounder and compared those models to a null model 
using a likelihood ratio test (LRT), which determines how much better the more complex 
model explains the data than the less complex model. Confounders were considered 
significant if the model with the potential confounder had an LRT P value of 0.05 or less, 
which was the case for ‘years on ART’ as well as ‘age’ for the comparison between the 
controls and the combined treatment group (Supplementary Table 7). We did not perform a 
standard Cox regression, since the proportional hazards assumption was not fulfilled for 
some of the variables. Rebound time was modelled using a log-normal distribution, which 
resulted in the best model fit as measured by Akaike information criterion (AIC) among 
several different distributions (Extended Data Fig. 4b–d). To determine the effect of the 
treatment after adjusting for the discovered confounders, we performed a weighted log-rank 
test42. Therefore, for each sample inverse probability weights based on the discovered 
confounders were estimated, which were used to re-weigh the variables of the log-rank 
statistic. We performed a bootstrapped version of the weighted log-rank test, as 
recommended in ref. 42 owing to the small sample size. We estimated the class probabilities 
using a lasso logistic regression model trained with the Matlab function lassoglm with five 
lambda values in a threefold cross-validation. To improve stability, the optimal lambda for 
the lasso logistic regression was determined only once using the original labels and used in 
all bootstrap runs to train the models that estimate the class probabilities.
Additionally, we performed an LRT at significance level α = 0.05 based on a parametric 
survival regression model adjusted for the discovered confounders. In this analysis the 
treatment group still significantly predicted the delay in rebound (Supplementary Table 7). 
For the analyses, the R (version 3.2.1) packages survival (version 2.38-3) and fitdistrplus 
(version 1.0-6) were used and Matlab (version R2015b) for implementation of the weighted 
log-rank test.
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis
Nucleotide alignments were generated using ClustalW (v.2.11)43 and manually adjusted 
using Geneious R8 (v.8.1.6)39 and MacClade (v.4.08a)44. Sites that could not be 
unambiguously aligned were removed for all phylogenetic analyses. Optimal evolutionary 
model classes were determined using jModelTest (v.2.1.4)45. Maximum likelihood 
phylogenetic trees were generated using PhyML (v.3)46 with joint estimation of evolutionary 
model parameter values and phylogenies. The tree comparing all participants was midpoint 
rooted and each within-subject tree was rooted on the basal branch as determined by the 
between-subject tree. Sequences with premature stop codons and frameshift mutations that

 fell in the gp120 surface glycoprotein region were excluded from all deduced protein 
analyses.
Sequences generated from the supernatants of viral outgrowth assays represented viruses 
that were present in the latent reservoir. Per assay, 4–8 million CD4+ T cells were activated. 
In an HIV-infected person who is completely suppressed on antiretroviral therapy, it has 
been determined that 1 × 10−6 resting CD4 cells are latently infected with replication 
competent virus47. Thus, one would expect to identify up to eight distinct viral isolates per 
individual culture. Single genome sequencing of the culture supernatants revealed sets of 
clonally related sequences, which appear as ‘rakes’ in a phylogenetic tree (Extended Data 
Figs 7 and 8). The most recent common ancestor of these rakes represents the reactivated 
virus that was present in the host (similar to the inference of infectious molecular clones as 
described in ref. 48). As shown in Extended Data Figs 7 and 8, sequences from culture 
reactions fall in 1–3 rakes within a given individual. We inferred each rake's most recent 
common ancestor (MRCA) by building a majority-rule consensus and treated it as a single 
virus from the participant's latent pool. These MRCAs were used to build the phylogenetic 
trees shown in Fig. 3.
Because mixed culture isolates replicated for 14 or more days, in vitro recombinants were 
observed. In vitro recombinants from culture reactions were identified and removed from the 
data set if they: (i) had two identifiable parental sequences within the same culture reaction; 
and (ii) exhibited three consecutive informative sites relative to one parent followed by three 
consecutive informative sites relative to another. We independently verified that a subset of 
these sequences showed evidence of recombination using the Recco tool (v.0.93)49.
Assessment of rebound virus clonality
The Poisson Fitter v2 tool50 is designed to test if a set of homogeneous sequences exhibits 
random diversification. If such a set of sequences exhibits a star-like phylogeny and a 
Poisson distribution of pairwise differences (Hamming distances), it can be inferred that a 
single virus gave rise to those sequences. Poisson Fitter v2 tests these and other parameters 
using maximum likelihood methods and performs a χ2 goodness of fit test to obtain a P 
value. A non-significant P value signifies that the observed Hamming distances adhere to a 
Poisson distribution and it can be inferred that a single virus gave rise to rebound. Single 
genome derived env sequences from the plasma at the earliest time point post-rebound from 
each participant were tested using Poisson Fitter (Supplementary Table 8).
ELISPOT T-cell response analysis
Interferon gamma Elispot assays were performed as described51. Briefly, 96-well 
polyvinylidene plates (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.) were precoated with 0.5 g/ml of anti-
IFNγ monoclonal antibody, 1-DIK (Mabtech, Stockholm, Sweden) and previously frozen 
PBMCs were plated at a concentration of 50,000 to 100,000 cells per well in a volume of 
100 μl of R10 medium (RPMI 1640 (Sigma), 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 10 mM HEPES 
buffer (Sigma)) with antibiotics (2 mM L-glutamine, 50 U of penicillin-streptomycin/ml). 
Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2, and developed as described51. Cells were 
tested against a panel of 410 B-clade overlapping 18-mer peptides (OLPs) spanning the

 entire HIV-1 genome (consensus sequence from 2001). These peptides were used in a matrix 
system of 11–12 peptides per pool to screen study participants for HIV-specific T cell 
responses. Confirmation of recognized individual peptides within a peptide pool was 
undertaken in an additional Elispot assay, as described52. Wells containing PBMCs and R10 
medium alone were used as negative controls and were run in duplicate on each plate. Wells 
containing PBMCs and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) served as positive controls. The numbers 
of spots per well were counted using an automated Elispot plate reader (ImmunoSpot Reader 
System; Cellular Technology Limited, Shaker Heights, OH). Responses were regarded as 
positive if they had at least three times the mean number of spot forming cells (SFC) in the 
two negative control wells and had to be >50 SFC/106 PBMCs (ref. 51,52).

 the trial participants (group A, group B and group A + B) differed significantly at 
significance level α = 0.05 from the survival curve of the ACTG trial participants. For the 
comparison of group A (group A + B) with the ACTG trial participants, we performed a 
weighted log-rank test adjusting for the clinical variables ‘years on ART’ and ‘age’ to 
correct for possible confounding factors (Supplementary Table 7 P <0.00001). We identified 
those potential confounders by univariate parametric survival regression using a likelihood 
ratio test (Statistical Methods). Since we did not discover any confounders with the same 
analysis among all available clinical variables for the comparison between group B 
participants and the ACTG trial participants, we performed a standard log-rank test in that 
setting (P < 0.0001). b–d, In order to perform a survival regression, the distribution of the 
rebound times has to be determined. Therefore, we compared the empirical cumulative 
distribution function (CDF) of the rebound times (black, solid line) with the CDF of the 
rebound times to a fitted distribution (Weibull, exponential, normal, logistic, log-normal, and 
gamma) for each comparison group (combined trial participants, group A or group B with 
ACTG control patients). Since the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian 
information criterion (BIC) were smallest for the log-normal distribution (green), we have 
chosen to model the rebound times with the log-normal distribution. e, Dot plot indicating

 Figure 1. 3BNC117 neutralization coverage, trial design and pharmacokinetics of 3BNC117 in 
HIV-1-infected individuals during ATI
a, b, Sensitivity of virus outgrowth cultures from 63 ART suppressed individuals to 
3BNC117 and VRC01 (Supplementary Table 1). The y-axis shows the fraction of viral 
outgrowth culture supernatants neutralized by a given antibody concentration (x-axis) in 
Tzm-bl assays. Red line indicates cut-off IC50 (2 μg ml−1) for participation in the trial. c, d, 
Diagrammatic representation of study groups A and B respectively. 3BNC117 infusions 
indicated by the red arrows, and sampling for PK and virologic studies indicated below. 
Numbers indicate study weeks. e, f, 3BNC117 levels as determined by ELISA for group A 
(n = 6, left panel, red), group B (n = 7, right panel, red (n = 4), black (n = 2) and purple (n = 
1)), HIV-1 negative (n = 3, blue) and viraemic individuals (n = 6, green)9. Curves indicate 
mean 3BNC117 levels, error bars the standard deviation. Arrows indicate 3BNC117 
infusions.

 Figure 2. Delay in viral rebound in the presence of 3BNC117
a, b, Plasma viral loads and 3BNC117 levels in group A and group B participants 
respectively. 3BNC117 infusions are indicated with red arrows. The left y-axis shows 
plasma viral loads in RNA copies per ml (black curves), and right y-axis shows antibody 
levels measured by ELISA (red curves). Average rebound time point (2.6 weeks, 
Supplementary Table 6) in 52 ACTG trial participants who underwent ATI without antibody 
treatment29 is shown with dotted lines. Grey areas indicate ART therapy. c, Kaplan–Meier 
plot summarizing viral rebound in 52 ACTG trial participants who underwent ATI without 
antibody treatment (black, Supplementary Table 6), and the combination of all 13 
participants (red) who underwent ATI with 3BNC117 infusions. The y-axis indicates the 
percentage of participants with viral levels below 200 RNA copies per ml, x-axis indicates 
weeks after ATI initiation. The P value is based on a bootstrap version of the weighted log-
rank test adjusting for the potential confounders ‘years on ART’, and ‘age’ (Supplementary 
Table 7, Methods Statistical Analyses). d, Dot plot indicating the relationship between 
3BNC117 sensitivity of pre-infusion outgrowth cultures at screening (y-axis, IC80 in μg 
ml−1) and the week of rebound (x-axis). Group A (n = 6) and group B (n = 7) participants 
are coloured red and blue respectively. The P value was derived from calculating the Pearson 
correlation coefficients. e, Dot plot indicating the relationship between 3BNC117 sensitivity 
of rebound outgrowth cultures (y-axis, IC80 in μg ml−1) and the 3BNC117 serum 
concentration at rebound (x-axis, in μg ml−1). 704, 708, 709 and 713 did not reach IC80 at 
the concentrations tested and were assigned a value of 22 μg ml−1. Group A (n = 6) and

 Figure 3. Viral rebound during ATI and 3BNC117 treatment
a, b, Graph of 3BNC117 (a) or 10-1074 (b) IC80 titres against baseline and rebound 
outgrowth cultures. Blue and green bars represent average IC80 titres against screen and day 
0 outgrowth cultures; red and purple bars represent IC80 titres against rebound outgrowth 
cultures from the indicated time points. Asterisks indicate cultures failing to reach an IC80 
up to 20 μg ml−1. c, d, Difference between rebound and pre-infusion culture IC80 titres 
(from a, b) for 3BNC117 (c) or 10-1074 (d). For cultures failing to reach an IC80 up to 20 
μg ml−1, a value of 20 μg ml−1 was assigned, and such cultures are marked with an asterisk. 
e, f, Clonality of the rebound virus. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees comparing pre-
ATI single genome derived env sequences (blue and orange) to rebound plasma env 
sequences (green and pink) are shown for participants whose rebound comprised single (e) 
versus multiple (f) viruses (Supplementary Table 8). Pre-ATI culture sequences were 
inferred as described in the Methods section ‘Statistical analyses’.

 Figure 4. 3BNC117 resistance in rebound viruses
a, Logogram shows env gp120 regions (amino acid positions; 270–285 and 455–467, 
according to HXBc2 numbering) indicating sequence changes from pre-infusion culture(s) 
(first row) to rebound sequences derived from plasma SGS at the indicated time points. The 
frequency of each amino acid is indicated by its height. Red residues represent mutations 
predicted to affect neutralization30. b, 3BNC117 neutralization sensitivity of pseudoviruses 
derived from pre-infusion or rebound SGS. Black lines represent pre-infusion virus envs; red 
lines represent the major env at rebound for each participant (Extended Data Figs 7 and 8, 
Supplementary Tables 8 and 9 and Methods); grey lines represent minor rebound envs in 
participants with multiple rebound viruses or variants that evolved after rebound (Extended 
Data Figs 7 and 8, Supplementary Table 9). Symbols reflect the means of two technical 
replicates; error bars denote standard deviation.
