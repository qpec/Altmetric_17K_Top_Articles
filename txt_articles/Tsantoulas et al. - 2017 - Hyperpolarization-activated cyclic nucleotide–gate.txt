Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated
2 (HCN2) ion channels drive pain in mouse models of
diabetic neuropathy

Diabetic patients frequently suffer from continuous pain that is poorly treated by currently available analgesics.
We used mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes to investigate a possible role for the hyperpolarization-
activated cyclic nucleotide–gated 2 (HCN2) ion channels as drivers of diabetic pain. Blocking or genetically deleting
HCN2 channels in small nociceptive neurons suppressed diabetes-associated mechanical allodynia and prevented
neuronal activation of second-order neurons in the spinal cord in mice. In addition, we found that intracellular cyclic
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a positive HCN2 modulator, is increased in somatosensory neurons in an animal
model of painful diabetes. We propose that the increased intracellular cAMP drives diabetes-associated pain by
facilitating HCN2 activation and consequently promoting repetitive firing in primary nociceptive nerve fibers. Our
results suggest that HCN2 may be an analgesic target in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy.
INTRODUCTION
Diabetes causes a characteristic degeneration of peripheral sensory
nerves, frequently associated with continuous pain. Painful diabetic
neuropathy (PDN) affects about one in four diabetic patients and typi-
cally manifests itself as a range of unpleasant positive symptoms such as
spontaneous pain, mechanical allodynia (a painful sensation caused by
light touch), and paresthesias (tingling, shooting pain), as well as neg-
ative symptoms such as thermal hyposensitivity (1). Despite its high
prevalence, the pathophysiology of PDN remains poorly understood.
Both anatomical changes (demyelination, loss of epidermal nerve den-
sity) and functional changes (reduced nerve conduction velocity) are
characteristics of PDN and of other “die-back” neuropathies (1–4).
The pathologies observed in the peripheral nervous system suggest
that peripheral nerve damage is the driver of PDN and that the as-
sociated ongoing pain is likely to be due to repetitive discharge of action
potentials in nociceptive (pain-sensitive) nerve fibers (5–7). However,
the molecular basis of peripheral nociceptor hyperexcitability remains
elusive.
Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated (HCN) ion
channels have recently emerged as crucial determinants of nociceptive
excitability [reviewed in (8, 9)]. HCN channels are unusual in that they
are activated by hyperpolarization in the range −60 to −90 mV, in con-
trast to all other voltage-activated channels that are activated by de-
polarization. There are four HCN isoforms (HCN1 to HCN4)
expressed in sensory neurons. More than half of small nociceptive
neurons express HCN2 channels (10), whereas in large sensory neurons
the fast HCN current (Ih) is mediated mainly by HCN1 (11, 12). HCN3
is widely expressed across dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons of all
sizes (11), whereas HCN4, which has a key pacemaking role in the heart
(13, 14), shows limited expression in somatosensory neurons (15, 16).
Elevations of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)
cause a strong shift in the voltage dependence of activation of HCN2
and HCN4 to more positive membrane voltages, causing an increase
in the inward current carried by these channels at resting membrane
voltage, whereas HCN1 and HCN3 are relatively insensitive to cAMP
and so have less influence in modulating neuronal excitability (17).
In nociceptive neurons, inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin
E2 (PGE2) and bradykinin activate adenylate cyclase via a Gs protein–
coupled pathway, thus causing a rise in intracellular cAMP, HCN2
activation, and increased spontaneous firing of action potentials (10).
AcriticalroleforHCN2in inflammatory painandin theneuropathic
pain caused by direct mechanical damage to sensory nerves has been
demonstrated by the potent analgesic actions of specific HCN channel
blockers and by targeted deletion of the Hcn2 gene in nociceptive
neurons in mice (10). Pharmacological inhibition of Ih prevents pain
in chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (18), which also features a die-
back denervation pattern, and circumstantial evidence has hinted at
an involvement of unidentified HCN family members in autonomic
diabetic neuropathy (19, 20).
Here, we expand our understanding of the critical role of HCN2
in chronic pain by showing that cAMP-mediated HCN2 activation
in a mouse model of diabetic neuropathy can trigger repetitive ac-
tivity in small nociceptive fibers, leading to central sensitization and
ongoing pain. Pharmacological or genetic block of HCN2 activity
exerts potent analgesic effects in animal models of both type 1 and type
2 diabetes.
RESULTS
Streptozotocin treatment results in symptoms indicative
of PDN
Diabetes was induced in wild-type (WT) mice by a single injection of
streptozotocin (STZ). Selective accumulation of STZ in pancreatic islet
b cells causes DNA alkylation, cell death, and consequent loss of insulin
production, resulting in an elevation of blood glucose. Mice treated with
STZ exhibited significantly increased blood glucose concentrations by
day 7 compared to the pre-STZ baseline (21.9 ± 2.1 mM versus 8.4 ±
0.2 mM, P < 0.001; Fig. 1A). STZ-treated mice remained hyper-
glycemic thereafter, whereas blood glucose concentration did not
change in vehicle-treated mice (10.1 ± 0.7 mM). The small number
of mice that did not exhibit hyperglycemia after STZ injection was
excluded from analysis (see Table 1).

 We examined whether the diabetic state was accompanied by altered
pain sensation, similar to that encountered in human PDN. Diabetic
mice showed a progressive hypersensitivity in response to mechanical
stimulation (Fig. 1B). The mechanical pain threshold was significantly
lower than baseline at 2 weeks, as indicated by the mean force required
to elicit paw withdrawal to mechanical stimulation (4.1 ± 0.1 g versus
3.5 ± 0.1 g, P = 0.012) and continued to decrease until 8 weeks (2.3 ±
0.1 g, P < 0.001), representing a 44% increase in mechanical pain sen-
sitivity (Fig. 1B). Mechanical hypersensitivity persisted for at least
18 weeks after STZ (2.7 ± 0.1 g, P < 0.001). In contrast, mechanical pain
thresholds of vehicle-treated mice remained at baseline levels for the
duration of the study (Fig. 1B). Testing with a thermal heat stimulus

as indicated by increased latency of paw withdrawal (6 weeks, 12.0 ±
0.6 s versus 9.2 ± 0.6 s, P = 0.002; 8 weeks, 12.7 ± 0.5 s versus 9.4 ± 0.5 s,
P < 0.001 compared to vehicle-treated mice) (Fig. 1C). The dual man-
ifestation of mechanical hypersensitivity and thermal hyposensitivity
mirrors the clinical presentation of diabetic neuropathy in humans.
Activation of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) by
STZ may be responsible for some of the manifestations of pain for
10 days after administration of STZ (21), and for this reason, we
carried out behavioral pain measurements at later time points (8 to
18 weeks after STZ). Notably, Fig. 1 (B and C) includes all mice that
developed diabetes, but for unknown reasons, only 70 to 90% of these
mice developed substantial pain hypersensitivity (see Materials and
Methods and Table 1).
Blocking peripheral HCN channels reverses
mechanical hypersensitivity
We next investigated whether HCN function is involved in the
mechanical pain hypersensitivity in PDN. To address this, we selected
mice with the most robust pain phenotypes at 8 weeks after STZ and
injected them intraperitoneally with ivabradine (IVA), which inhibits
all four HCN isoforms with approximately equal potency (22). Note
that IVA is excluded from the central nervous system (CNS) (18), so
its actions can be attributed to blockade of HCN ion channels in the
periphery. A single injection of IVA (2.5 mg/kg) increased diabetic pain
thresholds [from 2.2 ± 0.2 g after STZ to 3.1 ± 0.2 g at 30 min (P = 0.006)
and 3.2 ± 0.2 g at 60 min (P = 0.002) after IVA injection] (Fig. 1D). This
effect was also observed with higher IVA doses [5 mg/kg: from 2.3 ±
0.1 g after STZ to 3.2 ± 0.5 g at 30 min (P = 0.018) and 3.1 ± 0.3 g at
60 min (P = 0.024) after IVA injection; 10 mg/kg: from 2.1 ± 0.1 g
after STZ to 3.1 ± 0.3 g at 30 min (P = 0.001) and 3.3 ± 0.3 g at 60 min
(P < 0.001) after IVA injection]. At all doses, the IVA-mediated
analgesic effect on pain threshold was significant compared to the
vehicle group at 60 min after IVA injection (2.5 mg/kg, P = 0.014;
5 mg/kg, P = 0.016; 10 mg/kg, P = 0.021) and subsided after 120 min.
IVA had no effect on acute mechanical and thermal pain thresholds of
control mice (Fig. 1D and fig. S1), confirming previous observations
that HCN channels are not engaged during normal acute pain process-
ing (10). In addition, thermalhypoesthesia in mice treated withSTZ was
unaltered by IVA (fig. S1), suggesting that thermal hyposensitivity is
unrelated to changes in HCN ion channel function.
Because IVA did not completely restore normal pain sensitivity,
we asked whether the analgesic effect could be enhanced by repeated
administration of the drug. Two consecutive injections (5 mg/kg;
separated by 2 hours) increased pain thresholds beyond those of a
single administration, and a third injection completely restored
thresholds to prediabetic levels [from 3.9 ± 0.2 g before STZ to 4.0 ±
0.2 g at 30 min (P = 0.789), 3.8 ± 0.3 g at 60 min (P = 0.843), and 3.7 ±
0.3 g at 120 min (P = 0.960) after IVA injection] (Fig. 1E). Note that
there is a small change in threshold after each saline injection, likely to
be due to analgesia caused by the stress of handling and injection, but
the analgesia caused by IVA injection is significantly greater, particu-
larly after repeated injection.
Finally, we examined whether this cumulative effect could also be
seen with a more clinically relevant, spaced-out dosing regimen. We
treated the animals with IVA twice a day, 3 hours before and 3 hours
after pain threshold measurements over four consecutive days.
Mechanical thresholds on days 2 to 4 in mice treated with IVA were
not different from those recorded before STZ injection and progressive-
ly increased compared to saline-treated animals (day 2, P = 0.012; day 3,
P = 0.002; day 4, P = 0.014). The analgesia was fully reversible, and
cessation of treatment for 4 days resulted in a drop of mechanical
thresholds back to diabetic levels.
Because IVA inhibits all HCN isoforms, including HCN4, which is
important for cardiac pacemaking, we investigated the effect of the drug
on cardiac function using pulse oximetry. As expected, IVA (5 mg/kg)
caused a reduction in basal heart rate in control mice (29.2% at 30 min
versus baseline; P < 0.001) and a smaller reduction in diabetic mice
(15.8% at 30 min; P = 0.009 versus baseline, P = 0.001 versus CTRL +
IVA at 30 min; fig. S2). This lesser effect of IVA on diabetic cardiac
function has also been documented in STZ rats (23). IVA reduced
respiratory rate (fig. S2B) in both control and diabetic mice, but no
change was detected in oxygen saturation (fig. S2C) or pulse distention
at 30 min after injection (fig. S2D). There was no obvious effect on alert-
ness or exploratory behavior as detected by visual observation.
Together, the pulse oximetry data suggest that an analgesic dose of
IVA is well tolerated in both control and diabetic mice, causing brady-
cardia but no other adverse effects on cardiac function.
Peripheral HCN block is analgesic in type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes in humans; there-
fore, we tested the effect of HCN block in the db/db mouse model of
type 2 diabetes, in which mice homozygous for a leptin receptor muta-
tion (db/db) become obese in adulthood and show hyperglycemia
together with an array of diabetic symptoms (24). At 18 weeks of age,
all db/db mice were obese and hyperglycemic compared to heterozy-
gous age-matched controls (db/+) (body weight: db/db, 48 ± 0.6 g;
db/+, 29.3 ± 0.4 g, P < 0.001; blood glucose: db/db, 27 ± 1.3 mM; db/+,
9.4 ± 0.4 mM, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2A). The db/db mice exhibited signif-
icantly lower mechanical pain thresholds (3.6 ± 0.2 g versus 4.5 ± 0.2 g;
P < 0.001) (Fig. 2, B and C). Note that both the elevation in blood
glucose and the mechanical hyperalgesia were less than those of type
1 diabetic (STZ-injected) mice (compare Fig. 2 with Fig. 1, A and B).
A single IVA administration (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) restored
normal pain thresholds in db/db mice (from 3.6 ± 0.2 g to 4.6 ±
0.2 g; P < 0.001 versus saline at 60 min), whereas saline injection
had no significant effect on pain threshold (P = 0.47 at 60 min) com-
pared to baseline (Fig. 2C).
Induction of spinal c-Fos in diabetic mice is reversed by
HCN inhibition
We next sought a more direct way of demonstrating that enhanced
excitability of peripheral nociceptive neurons is involved in diabetes-
induced hyperalgesia. Activation of second-order neurons in the spi-
nal cord by primary afferent input induces c-Fos, an immediate-early
gene rapidly up-regulated by neuronal activity (25). Therefore, C-FOS
protein expression in neurons of the outer layers of the dorsal horn,
where nociceptive fibers terminate, may be indicative of sustained
peripheral nociceptive input and ongoing pain in diabetes. Quantifica-
tion of C-FOS immunoreactivity in lumbar spinal cord sections (lami-
nae I and II) revealed an increased number of C-FOS–positive neurons
in the dorsal horn at 8 weeks after STZ administration compared to
controls (26.0 ± 2.6 versus 1.2 ± 0.2 neurons per section; P < 0.001)
(Fig. 3). Although C-FOS activation was notably less compared to that
induced by a strong noxious stimulus [fig. S3 and (26)], it agrees with
previous studies in diabetes (27). IVA treatment (three intraperitoneal
injections of 5 mg/kg every 2 hours, as in Fig. 1E) reduced diabetes-
inducedC-FOSactivation6hoursafterthefirstinjection(6.2±0.4neurons

 per section; P < 0.001 versus STZ). These data indicate that PDN increases
activation of dorsalhorn neurons, likely due to enhancednociceptive input
to the spinal cord, and that this activation can be reversed by pharmaco-
logical block of HCN in the periphery.
Genetic deletion of HCN2 in nociceptive neurons prevents
development of diabetic pain
IVA blocks all four HCN isoforms equally (22), so to decipher which
HCN isoform causes hyperalgesia in diabetes, we used a conditional
knockout mouse line in which HCN2 had been selectively deleted in
nociceptive (NaV1.8-expressing) DRG neurons (HCN2 cKO) (10).
STZ treatment of HCN2 cKO mice or their littermate controls (fHCN2)
caused a similar hyperglycemia within 1 week (HCN2 cKO pre-STZ
versus post-STZ, 7.8 ± 0.5 mM versus 21.5 ± 1.4 mM, P < 0.001; fHCN2
pre-STZ versus post-STZ, 8.1 ± 0.3 mM versus 25.2 ± 3.4 mM, P <
0.001) (Fig. 4A). High blood glucose concentrations were also present
at 8 weeks (HCN2 cKO, 40.4 ± 0.6 mM; fHCN2, 34.2 ± 6.3 mM; P <
0.001 versus pre-STZ) (Fig. 4A). There was no significant difference
between genotypes at any time point
(1 week, P = 0.07; 8 weeks, P = 0.291), in-
dicating that both genotypes become dia-
betic to an equal extent.
We next studied the development of
PDN in these transgenic mice. Diabetic
fHCN2 mice, which are effectively WT,
developed a progressive mechanical hy-
persensitivity, evident asa significant drop
in mechanical thresholds compared to
prediabetic baseline (2 weeks, 3.7 ± 0.2 g;

8 weeks, 3.2 ± 0.3 g; P < 0.001 versus BL;
4.2 ± 0.1 g) (Fig. 4B). When we assessed
the HCN2 cKO mice, however, we found
no signs of mechanical hypersensitivity,
despite the ongoing diabetes. Mechanical
thresholds at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after STZ

in diabetic HCN2 cKO mice (15.6 ± 0.8 versus 1.4 ± 0.2 neurons per

deletion of HCN2 in NaV1.8+ nociceptors recapitulates the analgesia
and suppression of peripheral nociceptive drive caused by pharmaco-
logical block of HCN channels and, therefore, that HCN2 expressed in
nociceptive neurons is necessary for diabetes-induced pain in the mouse
STZ model.
Diabetes reduces plantar skin innervation
Intraepidermal nerve fiber density is often used as a diagnostic criterion
for peripheral neuropathy in human diabetic patients. We calculated
intraepidermal nerve fiber density in plantar skin of the hindpaw by
staining for PGP9.5, a pan-neuronal marker present in nerve terminals,
and for collagen IV, which stains the basement membrane at the dermis-
epidermis boundary. We also used 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) stain to highlight the nuclei of basal layer cells of the basement
membrane. With this combination of stains, nerve fibers crossing into
the epidermiswere visualized(Fig. 5A). Quantificationof intraepidermal
nerve fiber density revealed a significant reduction in WT diabetic mice
at 8 weeks after STZ compared to nondiabetic WT controls (26.8 ± 2.0
versus 44.2 ± 3.5 fibers/mm; P = 0.016), and this reduction was also
present 8 weeks after STZ in both fHCN2 mice (effectively WT) and
HCN2cKOmice(fHCN2:25.0±2.6fibers/mm,P=0.023versuscontrol;
HCN2 cKO: 28.1 ± 6.7 fibers/mm, P = 0.014 versus control) (Fig. 5B).
TheseresultsconfirmtheperipheralneuropathyintheSTZmousemodel
and demonstrate that the lack of a pain phenotype in the HCN2 cKO
mice is not due to a change in the denervation pattern. To further char-
acterize the identity of affected intraepidermal fibers, we stained for cal-
citonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which identifies peptidergic fibers,
including transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V mem-
ber 1 (TRPV1)–positive fibers that sense noxious heat. Diabetes reduced
intraepidermalCGRP+fibersfrom17.4± 0.8to 12.5±0.6fibers/mm(P=
0.006; Fig. 5C, bottom left graph). Because most TRPV1+ fibers in mouse
coexpress CGRP (28), this reduction agrees with the observed thermal
hyposensitivityin STZmice(Fig. 1C).There wasa significant inversecor-
relation between intraepidermal CGRP+ fiber density and heat pain
thresholds in diabetic mice (R2 = 0.88, P = 0.006; Fig. 5C, bottom right
graph).
Diabetes does not affect HCN2 expression in
sensory neurons
The preceding experiments show that enhanced peripheral HCN2
function plays a critical role in pain and mechanical hypersensitivity
in diabetes. To determine whether this is due to an up-regulation of
HCN2 expression in sensory neurons, we used immunohistochemistry

animals, HCN2 immunoreactivity was detected in 73.2 ± 4.5% of all
neurons, as revealed by colocalization with the pan-neuronal marker
b3-tubulin (examples denoted by arrows). As previously reported,
HCN2wasdetectedinarangeofcellsizes,includingmostsmall-diameter
neurons, the majority of which are nociceptive, as well as in larger neu-
rons with a characteristic membrane ring staining (29). In diabetic
animals at 8 weeks after STZ, the percentage of HCN2-positive neurons
was 72.5 ± 7.0%, not significantly different from control (P = 0.934;
Fig. 6B, left). In addition, the distribution of HCN2+ neurons among
subclasses of DRG neurons (small-, medium-, and large-diameter
classes) was also not different between control and diabetic (P = 0.116;
Fig. 6B, middle). When examining staining intensity in HCN2-positive
neurons,we foundnoeffect of diabetesamongallneurons[control,3.5±
0.2 arbitrary units (AU), versus diabetic, 3.9 ± 0.1 AU; P = 0.102] or
among DRG subpopulations (P = 0.802; Fig. 6B, right). The specificity
of the HCN2 antibody was confirmed by detection of HCN2 in small
NaV1.8+ nociceptive DRG neurons of WT mice but not of HCN2
cKO mice, as well as by the complete lack of HCN2 immunoreactivity
in DRG from HCN2 global KO (gKO) mice (Fig. 6C).
We investigated whether enhanced HCN2 function could be due to
changes not reflected in the cell soma (such as axonal trafficking), by
examining HCN2 expression in the sciatic nerve. The intensity of
axonal HCN2 staining was similar between control and STZ mice at
8 weeks (2.6 ± 0.1 AU versus 2.6 ± 0.6 AU; P = 0.871), suggesting that
there is no change in axonal HCN2 expression in diabetes (fig. S4A). We

 did not detect any HCN2 in epidermal nerve fi-
bers of control mice, probably because the
channel is present in low quantities in the very
fine peripheral nerve endings (fig. S4B).
We also examined expression and regulation
by diabetes of the other HCN isoforms in DRG
neurons. HCN1 was predominantly localized in
medium-large neurons (fig. S5), with no dif-
ference between control and diabetic conditions
in overall proportion of HCN1+ neurons, dis-
tribution of HCN1+ neurons among size classes,
or intensity of stain as a function of cell size. The
HCN3 isoform was detected in a mixture of neu-
ronsof allsizes(fig. S6), andthere was no effect of
diabetes on either proportion of HCN3+ neurons
or stain intensity as a function of size. HCN4 was
found mainly in medium-large neurons (fig. S7),
and again, there was no effect of diabetes on any
parameter. Overall, the immunohistological data
show that diabetes does not induce up-regulation
of any HCN isoform at the protein level. Note
that a previous study reported that diabetes in-
creases HCN expression and currents in para-
sympathetic neurons of the nodose ganglion,
suggesting that HCN channels may be differen-
tially regulated in autonomic neuropathy (19).
Diabetes does not change
electrophysiological properties of
isolated nociceptive neurons
We next examined the in vitro electrophysio-
logical properties of small DRG neurons [<20 mm
diameter, predominantly nociceptive in nature
(30)] from control and STZ mice to determine
whether diabetes alters HCN ion channel proper-
ties. In response to steady current injection, neu-
rons from STZ and nondiabetic mice showed a
similar increase in firing frequency with increasing
injected current, reaching a similar plateau level
(14.58 ± 1.87 versus 16.45 ± 2.99 spikes per second;
Fig. 7, A and B). Exposure to 50 mM forskolin,
which increases intracellular cAMP and shifts the
activation curve of HCN2 to a more positive mem-
brane voltage, increased firing frequency after
current injection, from 13.51 ± 2.26 to 21.68 ±
2.72 spikes per second (40 pA; P < 0.001) and
from14.58± 1.87to 24.0± 2.94spikespersecond
(50 pA; P = 0.009). The cAMP-dependent sensi-
tization of neuronal firing was also reflected in a
changeinthepatternoffiring,fromphasic(steady
current elicits one or a few spikes) to tonic [firing
continues throughout current injection; see Fig.
7C and (31)]. The proportion of phasic/tonic
firing neurons was similar between STZ and
nondiabetic mice at baseline (P > 0.05; Fig.
7D) and cAMP augmented tonic firing (P =
0.043 and P = 0.081, respectively) with no sig-
nificant difference between groups (P = 0.652;

 We used voltage clamp to compare maximum current densities in
nociceptive neurons by fully activating HCN channels with a hyper-
polarizing voltage step from −60 to −140 mV. Similar maximal current
amplitudes were observed in STZ and control mice and in the presence
or absence of forskolin, showing that maximum current density is not
affected by diabetes or by cAMP increase (P = 0.545; Fig. 7E). This result
supports the immunohistological data that showed no up-regulation of
HCN2 expression in diabetic neuropathy.
We examined the effect of cAMP on the voltage dependence of
HCN channel activation in small DRG neurons from STZ and non-
diabetic mice. Forskolin caused a depolarizing shift in HCN half-
activation voltage (V1/2) in both STZ (+10.83 mV, P < 0.001 versus
pre-forskolin, −97.1 ± 1.6 mV) and control neurons (+12.36 mV, P <
0.001 versus pre-forskolin, −99.0 ± 1.1 mV) (Fig. 7F). However, the
magnitude of the shift was not significantly different between diabetic
and control neurons (P = 0.779). Finally, to investigate the possibility
that the altered concentration of glucose in diabetes might affect the
function of HCN channels, we compared Ih currents in neurons in
extracellular solutions containing either low (5 mM) or high (25 mM)
glucose. Glucose concentration had no effect on activation curves or
current densities in either control or STZ neurons (fig. S8).
PDN is associated with increased cAMP in sensory neurons
The immunohistochemical and electrophysiological experiments above
show that diabetes does not cause any change in expression of HCN2 or
in the electrophysiological properties of isolated nociceptive neurons.
The marked effect of diabetic neuropathy on HCN2 function in vivo
could instead be due to factors that are present in diabetes and poten-
tiate HCN2 function but are rapidly lost after neuronal isolation. The
most likely way in which these unidentified factors might act is by
causing an increase of intracellular cAMP concentration in nociceptive
neurons, resulting in a potentiation of HCN2 activation through a pos-
itive shift in its activation curve on the voltage axis. We therefore
examined the effect of diabetes on the cAMP content in whole DRG
from control and diabetic mice. Analysis of DRG tissue from STZ-
treated mice in which prominent mechanical hypersensitivity had
been verified through behavioral tests showed that the cAMP content
was increased more than eightfold (nondiabetic, 3.1 ± 1.6 pmol/mg;
STZ pain, 26.6 ± 10.3 pmol/mg of total protein; P = 0.014). When
samples from fully diabetic mice, which did not exhibit substantial
mechanical hypersensitivity, were assessed (STZ no pain), cAMP con-
centrations were not significantly different from nondiabetic controls
(P = 0.811 versus nondiabetic; Fig. 8A).
Apart from binding directly to HCN ion channels, cAMP can also
activate the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), potentially
causing phosphorylation of other targets involved in pain transduction,
such as NaV1.8 and TRPV1. We therefore investigated the effect of the
PKA inhibitor H-89 on diabetes-induced hyperalgesia at doses found to
be effective in reducing PGE2-induced inflammatory pain (fig. S9) (32).
Systemic treatment with H-89 (5 mg/kg) had some effect in increasing
mechanical pain thresholds 8 weeks after STZ (P < 0.05 versus post-
STZ), but the magnitude of thiseffect wassmallercomparedtothe effect
of IVA (P < 0.05 IVA versus H-89 at any dose) (Fig. 8B).
DISCUSSION
PDN is a typical die-back neuropathy, in which unmyelinated C-fibers
and thinly myelinated Ad nociceptive fibers retreat first (33, 34), and in
which spontaneous firing develops in small fibers (5, 6, 35). The work
reported here provides further support for the idea of spontaneous
firing in small nociceptive nerve fibers, because in diabetic mice
C-FOS, which is an index of nociceptive afferent activity (25), is induced
in outer layers of the dorsal horn, where nociceptive afferents terminate.
A critical role for the HCN2 ion channel in maintaining the firing in
small-diameter afferent nerve fibers, and thus in promoting the pain
of diabetes, is supported by the following: (i) the complete suppression
of pain in mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes by the HCN
channel blocker IVA, which does not distinguish between HCN iso-
forms but is peripherally restricted (18), therefore localizing the site of
HCN block to the peripheral nervous system; (ii) the similar suppres-
sion of the pain associated with diabetes caused by deletion of HCN2 in
the NaV1.8-expressing population of nerve fibers, which are
predominantly smallunmyelinated C-fibers (36, 37); and (iii) the reduc-
tion in C-FOS expression in the dorsal horn achieved both by blocking
HCN channels with IVA and by genetically deleting HCN2 in NaV1.8-
expressing nerve fibers.
As many as 80% of diabetic patients with reduced small-fiber skin
innervation, caused by nerve degeneration, also exhibit hyposensitivity
to heat (3, 38, 39), which is consistent with the preferential expression of
the heat-sensitive ion channel TRPV1 in small unmyelinated nerve fi-
bers (40). An inverse correlation between TRPV1+ fiber skin innerva-
tion and heat detection has been directly demonstrated in diabetic
patients (41), and we also found an association between degeneration
of peptidergic intraepidermal nerve fibers (which include TRPV1+ fi-
bers) and increased heat thresholds in STZ-treated mice.
The painful sensation caused by light touch, known as mechanical
allodynia, which is one of the most unpleasant features of PDN, is likely
to be conveyed by large myelinated fibers (42). In agreement with this,
preventing conduction in large myelinated fibers alleviates mechanical
allodynia in PDN (43). How can spontaneous activity in small HCN2-
expressing unmyelinated fibers enhance the sensation of mechanical
allodynia, which is conveyed via large myelinated fibers? A probable
explanation lies in the phenomenon of central sensitization, in which
activation of small nociceptive nerve fibers causes a sensation of
mechanical allodynia, conveyed via large fibers. Central sensitization
is thought to be a result of neural plasticity in the dorsal horn, in which
afferent mechanoreceptor input is switched from second-order neurons
signaling innocuous light touch to second-order neurons signaling a
sensation of pain (44).
One possible explanation for increased firing in nociceptive fibers
in the mouse model of diabetes could be an up-regulation of HCN2
expression in sensory neurons, but both immunohistochemical and
electrophysiological approaches indicate that HCN2 protein ex-
pression and maximal current density were not different in neurons
isolated from diabetic and nondiabetic mice. In sensory neurons,
however, HCN2 function can be potentiated by an increased intra-
cellular cAMP, which we found to be elevated in DRG from the
mouse model of diabetes. Interaction of cAMP with the cyclic nucle-
otide binding domain in the C-terminal region of HCN2 results in
a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation, leading
to an enhanced inward current carried by HCN2 and thus to
augmented spontaneous and evoked firing (10). In agreement, rais-
ing cAMP concentrations with forskolin in vitro shifted the voltage
dependence of Ih toward more positive membrane voltages and
increased firing rates in small neurons both in the animal model
of type 1 diabetes and in control animals, and previous work has
shown that both the shift in Ih and the increased firing rate depend
on HCN2 (10).

 The mechanisms by which cAMP is elevated in nociceptive neurons
in diabeteshave not been determinedinthe presentstudy but are unlikely
to involve only inflammatory mediators released at a peripheral location
where neurodegeneration takes place, because we found an increase in
cAMP in DRG cell bodies, some distance from the site of neurodegenera-
tion. In other pain states, cAMP can be increased by binding of PGE2 or
other inflammatory mediators to GPCRs (heterotrimeric guanine
nucleotide–binding protein–coupled receptors), such as PGE2 receptor
4 (EP4), resulting in activation of adenylate cyclase and increased cAMP
production (10). Several lines of evidence support the idea that diabetes
is also associated with a similar proinflammatory phenotype. Diabetic
neuropathy increases the amounts of inflammatory mediators in the
DRG and sciatic nerve of rodents as well as in human blood (45–48).
Administration of inhibitors of adenylate cyclase restores mechanical
thresholds in diabetic rats, whereas cAMP analogs have the opposite
effect (49). The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which is
upstream of PGE2, is increased in diabetic DRG (50) and in sciatic nerve
(51), and bradykinin-induced PGE2 secretion is also potentiated by di-
abetes (52). In support of a sensitizing role of cAMP in sensory neurons,
COX-2 inhibitors are analgesic in diabetic mouse models when applied
peripherally but not intrathecally (53, 54), and COX-2 KO mice have
attenuated signs of peripheral neuropathy after induction of diabetes
(55). Other proinflammatory pathways may also be involved in activat-
ing adenylate cyclase and so increasing levels of cAMP.
Increased cAMP also activates PKA, which in turn phosphorylates
other ion channelsin the pain pathway, suchas NaV1.8 (56) andTRPV1
(57). Although an involvement of PKA-dependent sensitization of these
channels in PDN is possible (58), the complete abolition of hyper-
sensitivity either by an HCN blocker with few off-target actions (18)
or by genetic deletion of HCN2 strongly suggests that HCN2 has the
major influence in diabetes-induced hyperalgesia. This point is further
substantiated by the much larger effect of IVA on diabetic mechanical
pain thresholds compared to that of the PKA inhibitor H-89.
We propose that HCN2 sensitization, mediated by increased intra-
cellular cAMP, mediates pain in diabetes both by causing spontaneous
firing in nociceptive nerve fibers, due to HCN2 activation at the resting
membrane potential, and by promoting higher spiking frequencies in
response to a painful stimulus, due to a more rapid “pacemaker” de-
polarization rate between action poten-
tials. Central sensitization is then activated
by the enhanced firing in small nocicep-
tive afferents and causes mechanical allo-
dynia, a painful sensation initiated by
activation of large fibers by tactile stimuli.
The occurrence of spontaneous firing in
C-fibers in STZ-treated rodents has been
directly demonstrated using microneuro-
graphy(6).Wefoundevidence supporting
the idea of increased peripheral nocicep-
tive drive in diabetic mice by using C-FOS
staining. In addition, diabetes-induced
enhancement of firing frequency in C
polymodal nociceptors has been reported
using a skin-nerve preparation (35).
Diabetic rats treated with the potent
TRPV1 agonist resiniferatoxin, which is
neurotoxic to the TRPV1-expressing sub-
population of C-fibers, maintain me-
chanical allodynia (59), an observation
that is often cited as indicating that C-fibers are not involved in PDN.
However, two majorclasses of C-fibersare unaffected by resiniferatoxin,
namely, nociceptive nonpeptidergic C-fibers expressing the receptor
MAS-related GPR family member D (MRGPRD) and low-threshold
mechanoreceptors (60). Activity in these C-fibers may be able to drive
central sensitization and so cause mechanical allodynia.
Patients with neuropathic pain exhibit a variety of positive symp-
toms, for example, hyperalgesia and spontaneous pain, together with
negative symptoms such as sensory loss, and different treatments
may be appropriate depending on the symptoms displayed (61). In that
context, our results may be particularly relevant for diabetic patients in
whom ongoing pain, likely to be driven by spontaneous activity in
peripheral nerves, is a prominent feature. Microneurography studies
in humanshave shown thatperipheralnerveactivity isroutinely present
in neuropathicpainsyndromesinvolving peripheralneuropathy(62–64),
including diabetic neuropathy (65), and that the incidence of spontane-
ous activity is higher when accompanied by reports of ongoing pain (7).
We note, however, that there may not be an invariant link between spon-
taneous activity in peripheral nerves and ongoing pain because a number
of studies have proposed that changes in CNS processing can also influ-
ence the pain of diabetic neuropathy. Potential CNS events affecting neu-
ropathic pain include microglial activation in the spinal cord (66),
reduced thalamic activity and communication with cortex (67), loss of
graymatterinthethalamusandsomatosensorycortex(68),andimpaired
descending modulation (69).
We found that repeated treatment with IVA provided superior
analgesia compared to single administration. Although the mechanism
underlying this cumulative effect is not clear, it has been documented
before (70) and may indicate the existence of a long-lived IVA metab-
olite, similar to the morphine metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide,
which is 10-fold more potent than morphine itself (71). IVA is already
used clinically to treat angina pectoris via inhibition of HCN-dependent
firing in cardiac pacemaker cells, which slows heart rate and reduces the
oxygen demand of cardiac muscle. The established clinical experience
and available pharmacologicalprofiling means that IVA could be swiftly
assessed in PDN trials. One consideration will be the bradycardic effect
due to HCN4 inhibition in the sinoatrial node; nevertheless, a previous
study of IVA for diabetes-associated coronary artery disease showed a

 good safety profile with no notable bradycardia, visual disturbances, or
adverse effects on glucose metabolism (72). In addition, we demonstrate
here that targeted genetic deletion of HCN2 in the periphery gives
effective pain relief without detectable side effects. Therefore, the discov-
ery of CNS-excluded and HCN2-selective inhibitors is likely to provide
marked analgesia in PDN, together with a safe pharmacological profile.
HCN2 channels are closed and generate no inward current over the
normal range of the action potential, because their voltage range of ac-
tivation is negative under nonpathological conditions (9). An important
consequence of that is that blockade of HCN2 channels has no effect on
baseline neuronal excitability, nor does it modulate pain thresholds un-
der normal conditions. This is in contrast to the effects of blocking NaV
channels with local anesthetic, which produces total insensibility to
pain, or of human genetic deletion of NaV1.7, which causes complete
analgesia even under normal conditions, with consequent self-injury
(73). We propose here that in pathological pain states, including
PDN, HCN2 channels are recruited as initiators of spontaneous activity
only when the voltage range of activation undergoes a positive shift after
interaction of inflammatory mediators with Gs-coupled receptors and a
consequent elevation of intracellular cAMP. Thus, HCN2 channels are
an ideal analgesic target, because their blockade has an analgesic effect
only underpathologicalconditionsandshould have no effect onnormal
nociception.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The main objective of thisstudy was to test the effect of pharmacological
or genetic inhibition of HCN2 on pain in diabetic mice. For behavioral
assessment, animals were randomly chosen from multiple cages,
provided that they satisfied the inclusion criteria outlined in detail in
Supplementary Materials and Methods (“Diabetes models” section).
Sample sizes for animal behavior, histology, biochemistry, and
electrophysiology were chosen on the basis of previous experience with
these assays as the minimum number of independent observations
expected to achieve statistical significance. All behavioral testing was
conducted during the day in a quiet temperature-controlled room by
an experimenter blinded to the identity of drug treatment and/or mouse
genotype.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as means ± SEM, and group sizes are noted in
each figure legend. All replicates refer to biological replicates. Statis-
tical significance was determined with Prism (GraphPad Software)
or SigmaPlot (Systat Software Inc.) using unpaired, equal variance, two-
tailedStudent’sttest,linearregressionanalysis,c2test,one-wayANOVA,
two-way ANOVA, or two-way ANOVA with RM SNK or Bonferroni
tests (for post hoc analysis), as indicated in the corresponding figure
legends. Significance is indicated by *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P <
0.001. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant.
