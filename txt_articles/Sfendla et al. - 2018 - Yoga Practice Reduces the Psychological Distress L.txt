Background:
Psychiatric ill-health is prevalent among prison inmates and often
hampers their rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is crucial for reducing recidivistic offending. A
few studies have presented evidence of the positive effect of yoga on the well-being of
prison inmates. The conclusion of those previous studies that yoga is an effective method
in the rehabilitation process of inmates, and deserves and requires further attention.
Aims: The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of 10 weeks of yoga practice on the
mental health profile, operationalized in the form of psychological distress, of inmates.
Methods: One hundred and fifty-two volunteer participants (133 men; 19 women) were
randomly placed in either of two groups: to participate in weekly 90-min yoga class (yoga
group) or a weekly 90-min free-choice physical exercise (control group). The study period
lasted for 10 weeks. Prior to and at the end of the study period the participants completed
a battery of self-reported inventories, including the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI).
Results: Physical activity (including yoga) significantly reduced the inmates’ levels of
psychological distress. Yoga practice improved all primary symptom dimensions and
its positive effect on the obsessive-compulsive, paranoid ideation, and somatization
symptom dimensions of the BSI stayed significant even when comparing with the control
group.
Conclusions: Yoga as a form of physical activity is effective for reducing psychological
distress levels in prison inmates, with specific effect on symptoms such as suspicious and
fearful thoughts about losing autonomy, memory problems, difficulty in making decisions,
trouble concentrating, obsessive thought, and perception of bodily dysfunction.

INTRODUCTION
Originally, prisons were established to isolate convicted offenders in order to keep society safe.
The major tasks of these institutions included punishment and correction of individuals who
often had a history of aggression and/or antisocial behavior (1). Over time, the purpose of
correctional institutions changed; it shifted from isolation and punishment to prevention of relapse
into criminality by using different treatment programs. As psychiatric ill-health is a common
condition among prison inmates (2, 3), today’s correctional institutions pay greater attention to
the issue of inmates’ mental health as a factor determining the risk of relapse. It has been estimated
 Sfendla et al.
Yoga and Psychological Distress in Prison
that prisons hold more than three times as many persons
with psychiatric problems and/or diagnoses than can be found
in psychiatric facilities (4). Personality and mood disorders,
addiction, and neurodevelopmental syndromes are the most
frequent mental health problems occurring in prison inmates
(5, 6). Psychopathic personality profile (7), substance abuse and
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are the most recurring
diagnoses when considering the risk of relapse into a criminal life
style (8).
The Swedish Prison and Probation Service aims to enhance
inmates’ opportunities to reintegrate into society upon release
and their ability to live a drug free and law-abiding life. To this
end, the Prison and Probation Service requires all inmates to
participate in rehabilitation activities, 6 h a day, 5 days a week.
As the capabilities and needs of inmates differ greatly, there is
a wide range of activities to choose from. Beside occupational
activities, inmates are provided opportunities to participate in
study programs, rehabilitation programs concerning drug- and
alcohol abuse, violent behavior and aggression, yoga classes,
health programs, drama, painting and writing classes, etc (9).
The Prison and Probation Service has offered yoga classes
to inmates since 2008 [for details on the “Krimyoga” offered,
please see Kerekes et al. (10)]. Yoga aims to reconstruct the
balance between body and mind by using physical, psychological,
and spiritual practices. The core of yoga is conscious, deep
and slow breathing during which different body movements
are performed, while shifting one’s focus to the body in
still positions (body awareness) and to one’s feelings at the
moment. In some yoga forms, the session ends with meditation.
The physiological and psychological impacts of yoga have
been tested in various samples: general population, clinical
settings, and prison inmates (11–13). It has been shown
that regular exercises of yoga reduce physiological response
to stress (14), state and trait anxiety and depression (15),
antisocial behaviors (10), as well as anger and aggression (16).
Furthermore, regular yoga practice is coupled with increased
positive and decreased negative emotional states (10, 17),
decreased stress (17), as well as with significantly improved
impulse control and sustained attention (10). Importantly,
it has been shown that yoga in correctional settings has
a positive effect on risk factors associated with criminal
recidivism (10).
Beside
the
important
psychological
benefits,
yoga
practitioners experience physiological benefits, such as improved
body posture and breathing technique, increased body awareness
and easier relaxation (18). In terms of biological benefits, regular
yoga exercise has been found to favor normalized activity of the
hypothalamus, pituitary-, and adrenal glands, and the autonomic
nervous system (19), to decrease the concentration of cortisol,
and to increase the concentration of serotonin and melatonin
(18). As yoga can be practiced in group settings, it can also
have positive effects in terms of social relations and feelings of
belonging among those practicing yoga together (20).
Although the effects of yoga have already been studied, only
a few studies have been conducted among prison inmates. The
aim of this study is to investigate the effect of 10 weeks of
yoga practice on the participating prison inmates’ mental health
profile, operationalized in the form of psychological distress
levels.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Procedure and Sample
The present study is part of a broader research, therefore for a
detailed description of the study procedure and methods, please
refer to Kerekes et al. (10). In short, they were as follows: During
a 20-month period in 2013, 2014, and 2015, male and female
inmates from several high- and medium-security class prisons
participated in the study. After giving their consent to participate,
the inmates were randomly placed in either of two groups: a
group participating once a week for 10 weeks in a 90-min long
yoga class (the yoga group); a group participating once a week
for 10 weeks in a 90-min long free-choice non-yoga physical
exercise (the control group). Prior to the start (Time 1) of the 10-
week study period and again upon its completion (Time 2), the
participants completed a survey, comprising several self-reported
measures (assessing stress, aggression, affective states, sleep-
quality, and psychological well-being). One of these measures was
the Brief Symptom Inventory, which assesses a person’s level of
psychological distress.
A total sample of 226 inmates (201 men; 25 women)
participated in the study. The average attrition rate was 32.7%.
For detailed description of attrition rates and reasons in the
yoga and control groups, please see Kerekes et al. (10). The
final number of participants completing the whole study period
was 152 (133 men; 19 women). The participants were evenly
distributed between the yoga group and the control group [yoga
group: 77 (67 male and 10 female) with a mean age of 36.4 years;
control group: 75 (66 male and 9 female) with a mean age of 34.9
years]. A detailed description of the participants’ characteristics,
including comparison between the yoga and the control groups
was previously published in Kerekes et al. (10), where participants
in the yoga and control groups were comparable in gender
distribution, age, length of sentence, and security level of holding
prison.
Instrument—The Brief Symptom Inventory
The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) is a self-reported measure
of psychological distress and psychiatric symptoms (21). The
inventory consists of 53 items, assessing 9 primary symptom
dimensions (see details below), and the Global Severity Index
(GSI), which measures the individual’s overall psychological
distress level. Participants are asked to rate how much a problem
has bothered or distressed them over the previous month. Items
can be rated on a five-point Likert scale from 0 to 4 (0 = not at all,
1 = a little, 2 = moderately, 3 = substantially, and 4 = extremely).
Higher scores therefore indicate greater psychological distress,
whereas lower scores indicate better psychological well-being
and/or psychiatric health. The 9 primary symptom dimensions
are as follows:
1. Anxiety: Indications of tension, restlessness, and nervousness,
as well as experiences of free-floating anxiety or panic. The
following items defined the Anxiety scale in the present study:
Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org
2
September 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 407
 Sfendla et al.
Yoga and Psychological Distress in Prison
“Nervousness or shakiness inside,” “suddenly scared for no
reason,” “feeling fearful,” “feeling tense or keyed up,” “spells of
terror or panic,” “feeling so restless you could not sit still.”
2. Depression: A wide range of symptoms and signs from
dysphoric affect and mood, loss of energy and interest in
life activities to feelings of hopelessness and uselessness. The
following items defined the Depression scale in the present
study:
“Thoughts of ending your life,” “feeling lonely,” “feeling blue,”
“feeling no interest in things,” “feeling hopeless about the
future,” “feelings of worthlessness.”
3. Interpersonal
Sensitivity:
Feelings
of
inadequacy
and
inferiority and signs of uneasiness and discomfort during
interpersonal interactions. The following items defined the
Interpersonal Sensitivity scale in the present study:
“Your feelings are easily hurt,” “feelings that people are
unfriendly or dislike you,” “feeling inferior to others,” “feeling
very self-conscious with others.”
4. Hostility: Feelings of irritability and annoyance, the presence
of frequent arguments and urges to break things. The
following items defined the Hostility scale in the present study:
“Feeling easily annoyed or irritated,” “temper outbursts that
you cannot control,” “having urges to beat, injure, or harm
someone,” “having urges to break or smash things,” “getting
into frequent arguments.”
5. Obsessive-Compulsive:
Thoughts
and
actions
that
are
experienced as irresistible and persistent. The following items
defined the Obsessive-Compulsive scale in the present study:
“Trouble remembering things,” “feeling blocked in getting
things done,” “having to check and double check what you
do,” “difficulty in making decisions,” “your mind going blank,”
“trouble concentrating.”
6. Psychoticism: Psychoticism is described as a continuum
pending between a mildly alien life style and extremely
psychotic status. Outside the psychiatric population, this
dimension can measure social alienation. The following items
defined the Psychoticism scale in the present study:
“The idea that someone else can control your thoughts,”
“feeling lonely even when you are with people,” “never feeling
close to another person,” “the idea that something is wrong
with your mind.”
7. Paranoid Ideation: Suspicious, hostile, and fearful thoughts of
losing autonomy. The following items defined the Paranoid
Ideation scale in the present study:
“Feeling that others are to blame for most of your troubles,”
“feeling that most people cannot be trusted,” “feeling that you
are watched or talked about by others,” “others not giving
you proper credit for your achievements,” “feeling that people
would take advantage of you if you let them.”
8. Phobic Anxiety: Phobias such as fear of crowds, open spaces,
conveyances, etc. The following items defined the Phobic
Anxiety scale in the present study:
“Feeling afraid in open spaces,” “feeling afraid to travel on
buses, subways, or trains,” “having to avoid certain things,
places or activities because they frighten you,” “feeling uneasy
in crowds,” “feeling nervous when you are left alone.”
9. Somatization: The perception of bodily dysfunction. Aches,
pains, and other discomforts stemming from the musculature
or complaints coupled to the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal,
and respiratory systems. The following items defined the
Somatization scale in the present study:
“Faintness or dizziness,” “pains in heart or chest,” “nausea or
upset stomach,” “trouble getting your breath,” “numbness or
tingling in parts of your body,” “feeling weak in parts of your
body,” “feeling heavy in arms or legs.”
Yoga Classes and Free-Choice Physical
Exercise
The yoga classes were led by prison officers who had received
training in yoga instruction provided by the Swedish Prison and
Probation Service. The yoga classes (“Krimyoga”) were based on
hatha yoga, a form of physical yoga that includes elements of
relaxation specifically developed for use in correctional settings.
Each yoga class comprised (in sequence) at least 10 min of warm
up, a defined combination of asanas (yoga postures), about
5 min of breathing exercises, and finally 5 min of relaxation
and deep relaxation. The weekly yoga classes lasted for 90 min
and were carried out uniformly across the different correctional
facilities.
Free-choice physical exercise could typically include training
in gym, walking, basketball, or football. Post-intervention
assessment in our study included a question on time spent on
physical activity and ensured that each participant (of the control
group) indeed has spent at least 90 min every week with physical
activity.
Data Analysis
As the low number of female participants in the study (19 of 152)
did not allow gender-specific analyses, male and female subjects’
data were analyzed together in this study. Violation of normality
assumption was revealed by Shapiro–Wilk test in the assessed BSI
data. Non-parametric tests were therefore performed. Wilcoxon
Signed Rank test was used to assess changes in BSI scores from
Time 1 (beginning of the 10-week study period) to Time 2 (end
of the study period) within each group (yoga and control) and
Mann-Whitney U-test was conducted to compare differences
between the groups. The effect size was calculated by dividing the
z value by the square root of N (total number of cases). Cohen
(22) criteria of 0.1 = small effect, 0.3 = medium effect, 0.5 = large
effect were applied for the results interpretation. Significance

level was defined at p < 0.05. The data was processed with the
help of the statistical program SPSS version 23 (IBM).
Ethics
The regional Ethical Review Board in Linköping approved
the study (Dnr 2013/302 – 31). The prison inmates received
complete information (written and oral) about the study and the
conditions of participation. Participation was entirely voluntary
and all participants were ensured that their answers would
in no way affect their actual prison sentence to be served.
Participation required the signature of a written consent form.
The collected information was treated confidentially and the
researchers received only coded data. Participants who completed
the whole study received a compensation of 200 Swedish crowns
(about 20 euros/US dollars).
RESULTS
The data analysis revealed significant changes in all but
three primary symptom dimensions (obsessive-compulsive,
somatization, and phobic anxiety) in the control group. These
significant changes were improvements with small effect sizes (r
varied between 0.15 and 0.29) (Table 1). In the yoga group all
dimensions of psychological distress were significantly improved
with small or medium effect size (r varied between 0.19 and 0.36)
(Table 1). While the Global Severity index decreased in both
groups with a similar, medium effect size, the effect size of the
measured improvements in each primary dimension was always
bigger within the yoga group. Table 1 summarizes the results of
the within-group analyses on the General Severity Index (GSI)
and the 9 primary symptom dimensions of the BSI in the control
and the yoga groups separately.
Between-group analyses revealed highly significant changes in
three primary BSI symptom dimensions: obsessive-compulsive,
paranoid ideation, and somatization. A significantly lower
mean was reported for the score on the obsessive-compulsive
dimension by the yoga group (mean rank = 62.72, n = 71)
compared to the control group (mean rank = 82.01, n = 73),
(z = −2.79, p = 0.005, r = 0.23). A significantly lower mean
rank difference was also reported for the score on the paranoid
ideation dimension by the yoga group (mean rank = 65.02,
n = 71) compared to the control group (mean rank = 80.66,
n = 74), (z = −2.25, p = 0.024, r = 0.18), and similarly for
the primary dimension of somatization by the yoga group (mean
rank = 64.46, n = 71) compared to the control group (mean
rank = 80.32, n = 73), (z = −2.29, p = 0.022, r = 0.19). All
of these differences had a small effect size. Table 2 summarizes
the results of the between-group analyses on the General Severity
Index (GSI) and the 9 primary symptom dimensions of the BSI.
DISCUSSION
The present study provides further evidence that physical
activity generally reduces psychological distress and psychiatric
complaints in prison inmate samples. The main finding of the
present study is that yoga practice has specific positive effects on
the mental ill-health of prison inmates, offering significant help

with symptoms of paranoid ideation, memory problems, trouble

In this study, inmates were randomized into either a group
where they could participate in a weekly yoga exercise or
into a group where they could practice free-choice non-yoga
physical activity, both during a 10-week period. Both groups of
inmates reported significantly improved psychological distress
levels, mostly in terms of decreased levels of anxiety, depressive
symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, suspiciousness, hostility,
fearful thoughts, and social alienation.
General Effects of Physical Activity
(Including Yoga) on the Level of
Psychological Distress And/Or Psychiatric
Complaints
This study revealed a significantly decreased level of anxiety and
depressive symptoms in both groups. The negative association
between physical activity and prevalence of depression and
anxiety disorders has been repeatedly described in previous
research and repeated now with our study. A few studies
even examined the association between physical activity and
these complaints in a prospective design. A review of these
prospective studies suggests that physical activity may be
clinically effective, at least in major depression and panic
disorder (23). Moreover, cardiovascular and resistance training
and high-intensity strength training have been found to
significantly reduce depression scale scores after a 9-month
testing period (24), cardiovascular and resistance training
has showed significantly improved numbers in interpersonal
sensitivity, and high-intensity strength training has showed
improved numbers in anxiety, phobic anxiety, and hostility
(24). This study supports that these measures (interpersonal
sensitivity, phobic anxiety, and hostility) also significantly
improve after 10 weeks of yoga exercises. Consistent with
previous findings, this study also shows that yoga can be used
advantageously against depression and anxiety (25, 26).
Previous research found that yoga, as a complement to drug
treatment, is suitable for patients diagnosed with schizophrenia
and helps patients with psychoticism or paranoid ideation to
regain better quality of life and socio-professional function
(26, 27). In this study, we found that these dimensions of
psychological distress were significantly improved not only by
yoga, but also by regular non-yoga free-choice physical activity.
Specific Effects of Yoga on Psychological
Distress And/Or Psychiatric Complaints
In this study, we measured a significant decrease in paranoid
symptoms—such as suspicious and fearful thoughts about others
planning or willing to take one’s autonomy—after 10 weeks of
yoga classes when compared to the non-yoga control group.
This is in line with previous findings from clinical studies where
yoga therapy programs revealed significant improvement of
both positive and negative psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia
patients (28). This study is, however, the first to show a reduction
of paranoid thoughts in prison inmates.
The other primary symptom dimension for which a significant
difference was measured between the yoga group and the control
group after the study period was the obsessive-compulsive
symptom dimension. The effect of yoga particularly on obsessive-
compulsive disorder was suggested in previous research (29).
Furthermore, in a clinical population an increased effect of
pharmaceutical treatment was observed when patients with
obsessive-compulsive symptoms participated in yoga classes (30).
Yoga has a direct calming effect and can lead to an
improved ability to control thoughts. Yoga may prevent or
decrease thoughts from becoming obsessions and thus help
the individual master his or her compulsive behavior (30).
Positive results have been found for yoga practice as a
complementary treatment for medication or psychotherapy for
General Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,
including for imprisoned individuals (24). Moreover, significant
improvements in concentration (31), sustained attention (10),
and memory (32) have been measured after yoga practice.
This study also shown that yoga, but not non-yoga free-choice
exercise, can significantly reduce symptoms of somatization.
Yoga, in addition to its positive effects on mental conditions such
as anxiety and depression, has also been found to have a positive
effect on somatization symptoms (33), which is in accordance
with our findings. Clinical symptoms of somatization include
dizziness, headache, chest pain, nausea, difficulty breathing,
feelings of body weakness, body numbness, and a heavy feeling
in the body. Through the different variations of body postures
the participants of yoga classes increase their body awareness,
thus improving their sense of control over their own body (31),
their perception of bodily dysfunction, and their ability to prevent
psychosomatic symptoms (33).
The above discussed results of our study could be explained by
underlining neurobiological changes. For example several studies
have investigated the effects of yoga on the sympathetic and
parasympathetic functions of the autonomic nervous system as

 Sfendla et al.
Yoga and Psychological Distress in Prison
well as on the regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal
axis (29, 34). These studies show that regular yoga exercise can
reduce the levels of cortisol and catecholamines (adrenaline and
noradrenaline) and increase the levels of serotonin, melatonin
and gamma-amino butyric acid, which are all important factors
in the regulation of mental health. Other physiological effects
of yoga practice, in particular improved cortisol levels, can
also be associated with improved self-esteem and mental and
emotional states. These yoga-induced chemical changes in the
body entail improved experiences of well-being and reduced
levels of psychological distress (34).
Strengths and Limitations
The present study was a randomized controlled trial. This
method is used to minimize the bias effects of extraneous or
irrelevant variables on the measurements, and provides the
strongest evidence of the effects of a treatment.
One limitation of the study is that the information about
inmates’ psychiatric health profile was operationalized and not
assessed during a clinical examination. In addition, the use of
self-reported measures is a limitation. Self-reported measures rely
greatly on the respondent’s capability to remember and admit the
“truth”; answers may be distorted by social desirability and recall
biases (35). However, self-reported research instruments present
the significant advantages that they can be used without any
clinical experience, are cost efficient, and can cover considerably
larger numbers of individuals than when clinical measurements
or semi-structured interviews are used for data collection in
a given time frame. Furthermore, it has been found that in
some cases it can be easier for respondents to report problems
and complaints through an anonymous self-report, than during
face-to-face clinical interview surveys or measures (35).
CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTIONS FOR
FURTHER RESEARCH
This study confirms that physical activity has a positive
effect on the psychological distress levels of prison inmates
and provides new evidence about the specific positive effect
of yoga on symptoms such as paranoid thoughts, memory
problems, difficult decision making, trouble concentrating,
obsessive thoughts, perception of bodily dysfunction, and
somatization. The provision of opportunities for prison inmates
to carry out physical activity in general and yoga exercise
in particular can be an important tool for improving their
reintegration into society
and for
helping them lead a
drug
free
and
law-abiding
lifestyle
upon
release,
which
hypothesis should be tested in larger scale studies including
follow-up recording of eventual long-term effects of the
treatment.
