ABSTRACT  
49 
Associations between outdoor air pollution and asthma in adults are still scarce, and the 
50 
underlying biological mechanisms are poorly understood. 
51 
To study the associations between 1) long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution and current 
52 
asthma 2) exhaled 8-isoprostanes, a biomarker related to oxidative stress and current asthma, 
53 
and 3) outdoor air pollution and exhaled 8-isoprostanes. 
54 
Cross-sectional analyses were conducted in 608 adults (39% with current asthma) from the 
55 
first follow-up of the French case-control and family study on asthma (EGEA). The NO2, 
56 
NOx, PM10, PM2.5, road traffic, and O3 were assessed by ESCAPE FP7 and IFEN. Models 
57 
took account city and familial dependence. 
58 
 The risk of current asthma increased with traffic intensity (adjusted (a)OR=1.09 95%CI: 
59 
[1.00, 1.18] per 5,000 vehicles/day), with O3 exposure (aOR=2.04 [1.27, 3.29] per 10 µg/m3), 
60 
and with exhaled 8-iso concentration (aOR=1.50 [ 1.06, 2.12] per 1 pg/mL). Among 
61 
participants without asthma, exhaled 8-iso concentration increased with PM2.5 exposure 
62 
(adjusted (a)β=0.23 95 CI [0.005, 0.46] per 5 µg/m3) and decreased with O3 and O3-summer 
63 
exposures (aβ=-0.20 [-0.39, -0.01], aβ=-0.52 [-0.77, -0.26] per 10 µg/m3, respectively). 
64 
Results add new insights of a potential role of oxidative stress in the associations between 
65 
outdoor air pollution and asthma in adults.

Introduction 
68 
According to the World Health Organization, outdoor air pollution caused 3.7 million deaths 
69 
in the world in 2012, and 9 % of the total mortality in France was recently attributed to 
70 
particulate matter with a diameter ≤ 2.5 microns (PM2.5) [1]. The most studied pollutants in 
71 
relation with health effects are nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and particulate matter 
72 
(PM10 and PM2.5). Evidence of the impact of outdoor air pollution on respiratory health is 
73 
increasing [2] [3], and the associations between exposure to outdoor air pollution and asthma 
74 
have been largely studied in children [4]. However, studies on associations between long-term 
75 
exposure to outdoor air pollution and asthma among adults are still scarce [5]. 
76 
One biological mechanism proposed to partly explain the association between outdoor air 
77 
pollution and asthma is oxidative stress [6]. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between the 
78 
increase to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant response [7]. Among the biological 
79 
markers related to oxidative stress, 8-isoprostanes (8-iso) are known as stable and specific 
80 
products of lipid peroxidation [8]. Interestingly, 8-iso can be measured non-invasively in 
81 
exhaled breath condensate (EBC), a fluid close to the lungs [7]. An increase of 8-iso 
82 
concentration along with a decline of antioxidant defense can induce tissue damages and can 
83 
contribute to pathophysiological changes as those seen in asthma [9, 10]. 8-iso are known to 
84 
provoke airway hyperresponsiveness, to increase the production of mucus and to promote 
85 
contraction of smooth muscles [10] [11]. In a recent systematic review, 8-iso concentration 
86 
was found higher in adults with severe asthma than in those with mild-to-moderate asthma 
87 
[12]. To date, epidemiological studies on the associations between long-term exposure to 
88 
outdoor air pollution and asthma including the measurement of 8-iso in adults are lacking. 
89 
In the present paper, among adults from the Epidemiological study of the Genetic and 
90 
Environmental factors of Asthma (EGEA), we first studied the associations between long-
91 
term exposure to outdoor air pollution (NO2, NOx, PM10, PM2.5, traffic load, traffic intensity, 
92 
         5 
 
O3 and O3-summer) and current asthma. Second, we studied the associations between 8-iso 
93 
measured in EBC with both long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution and current asthma.  
94 
 
95 
Methods 
96 
Study population 
97 
EGEA is a cohort study based on an initial group of asthma cases recruited in chest clinics 
98 
from 5 French cities (1991-1995) along with their first-degree relatives, and a group of 
99 
controls (https://egeanet.vjf.inserm.fr/). Child controls were recruited in surgery hospitals, and 
100 
adult controls in electoral rolls and from surgery hospitals or check-up centers [13]. The 
101 
protocol and descriptive characteristics have been described previously [13, 14], and inclusion 
102 
criteria used to define asthmatic cases and controls were described in the online 
103 
supplementary material. EGEA collection is certified ISO 9001 [15]. Ethical approval was 
104 
obtained from the relevant institutional review board committees (Cochin Port-Royal Hospital 
105 
and Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital, Paris). All participants signed a written informed 
106 
consent. 
107 
The present analyses included 608 adults (≥ 16 years old) in the framework of the first follow-
108 
up (EGEA2, 2003-2007), with available data on current asthma, outdoor air pollution assessed 
109 
by the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) and exhaled 8-iso 
110 
concentration (figure 1). Among the 608 participants, 5 had no pollution data from the French 
111 
Institute for the Environment (IFEN) assessment. No significant differences were found 
112 
between the participants included and those not included (n=963, see online supplementary 
113 
table E1).  
114 
 
115 
Respiratory phenotypes 
116 
         6 
 
At EGEA2, the participants with ever asthma answered positively to at least one of the two 
117 
following questions “Have you ever had attacks of breathlessness at rest with wheezing?” or 
118 
“Have you ever had asthma attacks?”, or were recruited as asthmatic cases at EGEA1. 
119 
Among participants with ever asthma, “current asthma” was defined by a report of respiratory 
120 
symptoms (wheeze, nocturnal chest tightness, attacks of breathlessness following strenuous 
121 
activity, at rest or at night time), or asthma attacks or use of inhaled and/or oral medicines 
122 
because of breathing problems in the past twelve months [16] (see the online supplementary 
123 
material for more details). Only participants with current asthma were included in the 
124 
analyses because the phenotype “current asthma” which reflects the recent activity of the 
125 
disease was more relevant than the phenotype “ever asthma” to study the associations 
126 
between long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution, biological markers and asthma.  
127 
 
128 
Exposure assessment 
129 
Thanks to ESCAPE and IFEN assessments, outdoor air pollution exposures (NO2, NOx, PM, 
130 
O3 and road traffic) were assigned to each participant’s residential address. 
131 
Annual air pollution levels of NO2 and particulate matter (PM) were derived from ESCAPE 
132 
standardized models (www.escapeproject.eu/manuals/). Briefly, the ESCAPE monitoring 
133 
campaigns took place between 2009 and 2010, including 40 measurement sites for NO2 and 
134 
NOx in Paris, Lyon, Grenoble and Marseille, and 20 PM measurement sites in Paris and 
135 
Grenoble. Land-use regression (LUR) models were developed and two indicators of road 
136 
traffic were also calculated. Traffic intensity on nearest road was defined as the number of 
137 
motor vehicles circulating per day on nearest road to participant’s home, and was expressed in 
138 
vehicles per day. Total traffic load was defined as the traffic load in all major roads based 
139 
around a buffer of 100 meters from the participant’s home, and was expressed by traffic 
140 
intensity multiplied by road length. The back-extrapolation is used to transfer the recent or 
141 
         7 
 
current LUR models to earlier years. In our study, the estimation of outdoor air pollution by 
142 
ESCAPE took place after EGEA2, and accordingly we also analyzed the back-extrapolated 
143 
pollution estimates in order to get a better temporality between outdoor air pollution with 
144 
current asthma and EBC collection. Back-extrapolated pollution data were available for NO2, 
145 
NOx in all cities, and for PM10 in Paris. 
146 
In order to supplement the ESCAPE data set, we used O3 and O3-summer exposures from the 
147 
IFEN (see the online supplementary material for more details). The O3 estimate was the 
148 
yearly mean of ozone level in 2004 for each participant at the residential address, and derived 
149 
from a geo-statistical model as previously described [17]. The exposure of O3-summer was 
150 
assessed from the monthly means from April to September. 
151 
 
152 
Measurement of exhaled 8-isoprostanes 
153 
Exhaled Breath Condensate (EBC) was collected at EGEA2 between 2003 and 2006 with an 
154 
RTubeTM (Respiratory Research Inc., Charlottesville, VA, USA) according to a standardized 
155 
method, as described previously [18]. Samples were immediately stored at -80°C. Exhaled 8-
156 
iso concentration was measured5.3 to 9.4 years  after EBC collection, with a specific enzyme 
157 
immunoassay (EIA) kit (8-isoprostanes EIA kit Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) 
158 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Approximately 30% of exhaled 8-iso concentration 
159 
was below the Limit of Detection (< LD, see the online supplementary material for more 
160 
details).  
161 
 
162 
Statistical analyses  
163 
The level of outdoor air pollution was described by city. Due to its skewed distribution, the 
164 
exhaled 8-iso concentration was log-transformed.   
165 
Associations between outdoor air pollution and current asthma, and associations between 
166 
         8 
 
exhaled 8-iso concentration and current asthma were studied with logistic models. In order to 
167 
study the association between outdoor air pollution and exhaled 8-iso concentration 
168 
independently of asthma, linear regression models were first performed among participants 
169 
without asthma and sensitivity analyses were conducted by: a) using back-extrapolated 
170 
pollution estimates, b) studying the associations by city, and c) using bi-pollutant models 
171 
(PM2.5 and O3 or O3-summer). Analyses with back-extrapolated pollution estimates were 
172 
performed to get a better temporality between pollution and EBC collection. We also studied 
173 
the associations between outdoor air pollution and exhaled 8-iso concentration in all 
174 
participants, and among participants with current asthma.  
175 
All estimates were adjusted for age, sex, smoking habits. Further adjustments were conducted 
176 
for body mass index (BMI), socio-professional category (SPC), and use of cleaning products 
177 
which is an indicator of exposure to indoor pollution. In order to study only the road traffic 
178 
effect, estimates of associations between road traffic and current asthma or exhaled 8-iso 
179 
concentration were also adjusted for background NO2. As the aim was to study the effect of 
180 
long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution, we performed sensitivity analyses by excluding 
181 
participants who lived less than one year at the same address (N=46).   
182 
In order to take into account the city-effect on outdoor air pollution levels, we performed 
183 
meta-analyses including city-specific analyses from the Harvard School of Public Health’s 
184 
macro program (https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/donna-spiegelman/software/metaanal), and 
185 
pooled analyses with random effect on city. 
186 
The above models have taken into account random effects on familial dependence. All the 
187 
results are expressed for an increase of 1 pg/mL of exhaled 8-iso concentration, an increase of 
188 
20 µg/m3 of NOx, 10 µg/m3 of NO2, PM10, O3 and O3-summer and 5 µg/m3 of PM2.5. For traffic 
189 
measures,  the results of traffic load are expressed for four million vehicles × m/day in major 
190 
roads within a 100-m buffer, and the results of traffic intensity are expressed for an increase 
191 
         9 
 
of 5,000 vehicles/day on major road. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, 
192 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA). 
193 
 
194 
Results  
195 
The mean age of the 608 adults was 43 years, 47% were males, 39% had current asthma, 21% 
196 
were current smokers, and 37 % were overweight (BMI ≥25 kg/m2) (table 1). Participants 
197 
with current asthma were younger, more often men, current smokers and unemployed, and 
198 
had more often a secondary education level than those without asthma (table 1). Participants 
199 
with current asthma had also a lower FEV1, higher airway hyperresponsiveness, higher 
200 
allergic sensitization, higher IgE level, and higher exhaled 8-iso concentration than those 
201 
without asthma.  
202 
The characteristics of participants were heterogeneous across cities (see the online 
203 
supplementary table E2 and the online supplementary material for more details).  
204 
The pollutant and traffic levels were the highest in Paris, except for the PM10 level (online 
205 
supplementary figures E1 and E2). The PM10 and PM2.5 levels were above the values 
206 
recommended by the WHO. The O3 and O3-summer levels were the highest in Marseille (online 
207 
supplementary figure E3). Positive and significant correlations were found between NO2, 
208 
NOx, PM10, and PM2.5 (correlation coefficient (r) 0.47≤r≤0.95, all P<0.002) whereas O3 and 
209 
O3-summer levels were negatively correlated with all pollutants (-0.50≤r≤-0.15, all P<0.002) 
210 
(data not shown). The NO2 level was significantly higher in managers and technicians, and 
211 
O3-summer level was significantly higher in manual workers (data not shown).  
212 
The exhaled 8-iso concentration (25th;75th percentiles) was 3.16 (1.40;7.69) pg/mL in all 
213 
participants and 3.97 (1.85;9.10) pg/mL among those with current asthma (table 1), and was 7 
214 
times higher in Paris than in other cities, was higher in women and decreased with age (online 
215 
supplementary tables E2 and E3). No significant association was found between exhaled 8-iso 
216 
         10 
 
concentration and smoking expressed as current smoking habits, quantity of tobacco, or 
217 
number of pack-years (all P>0.80, data not shown). No inter-plate variability was observed 
218 
(data not shown) and no association was found between storage time and exhaled 8-iso 
219 
concentration (regression coefficient=0.02, P=0.39). 
220 
 
221 
Associations between outdoor air pollution and current asthma 
222 
Associations between outdoor air pollution and current asthma were not significantly 
223 
heterogeneous between cities (Q test, p-value>0.08). In pooled analyses, the risk of current 
224 
asthma increased significantly with traffic intensity (adjusted (a)OR=1.09 95%CI [1.00, 
225 
1.18]) and with O3 exposure (aOR=2.04 [1.27, 3.29], table 2) whatever the adjustment.  The 
226 
results were similar after excluding participants who lived less than one year at the same 
227 
address. Back-extrapolated exposure estimates gave similar results (online supplementary 
228 
table E4).  
229 
 
230 
Associations between exhaled 8-iso concentration and current asthma  
231 
A positive and significant association was found between exhaled 8-iso concentration 
232 
expressed as a continuous variable and current asthma (aOR=1.50 [1.06, 2.12], figure 2). No 
233 
significant association was found when exhaled 8-iso concentration was expressed as <LD or 
234 
>LD. Overall, the risk of current asthma increased significantly with exhaled 8-iso 
235 
concentration expressed as < LD, >LD and ≤median, >LD and >median (trend p-value=0.05). 
236 
Exhaled 8-iso concentration was unrelated to duration of asthma (years), age of asthma onset 
237 
expressed continuously (years) or in classes (all P>0.40). Further, no significant association 
238 
was found between exhaled 8-iso concentration with FEV1 % predicted continuously or in 
239 
classes (all P>0.60) or allergic sensitization (P=0.12), (data not shown). 
240 
 
241 
         11 
 
Associations between outdoor air pollution and exhaled 8-iso concentration among 
242 
participants without asthma 
243 
Associations between outdoor air pollution and exhaled 8-iso concentration were not 
244 
heterogeneous between cities (Q test, p-values>0.20). In pooled analyses, exhaled 8-iso 
245 
concentration increased significantly with PM2.5 exposure (adjusted (a)β=0.23 [0.005, 0.46], 
246 
and decreased with O3 and O3-summer exposures (aβ=-0.20 [-0.39,-0.01] and aβ=-0.52 [-0.77,-
247 
0.26] whatever the adjustment, table 3). The results were similar after excluding participants 
248 
who lived less than one year at the same address. Analyses performed with back-extrapolated 
249 
data also gave similar results (online supplemental table E5). Furthermore, exhaled 8-iso 
250 
concentration decreased significantly with O3 and O3-summer exposures in Paris (aβ=-0.22 [-
251 
0.42,-0.02] and aβ=-0.53 [-0.90,-0.16], online supplementary tables E6). After excluding 
252 
participants from Paris (n=111), no significant associations were observed between O3 and 
253 
O3-summer and exhaled 8-iso concentration (online supplementary table E7). In models adjusted 
254 
for both PM2.5 and O3, similar result was found only between O3-summer exposure and exhaled 
255 
8-iso concentration (aβ=-0.59 [-0.71,-0.47], online supplementary table E8). In models 
256 
adjusted for both NO2 and O3, the negative associations between O3 and O3-summer and exhaled 
257 
8-iso concentration remained statistically significant (data not shown). In all participants, only 
258 
O3-summer exposure was negatively and significantly associated with exhaled 8-iso 
259 
concentration (aβ=-0.33 [-0.55,-0.11], data not shown). No association was found between 
260 
outdoor air pollution and exhaled 8-iso concentration in participants with current asthma (data 
261 
not shown).

For the first time in adults, we found associations between long-term exposures to outdoor air 
265 
pollution estimated at individual level, exhaled 8-iso concentration and current asthma. 
266 
         12 
 
Traffic intensity and O3 exposure increased significantly the risk of current asthma. Exhaled 
267 
8-iso concentration was positively and significantly associated with current asthma. Among 
268 
participants without asthma, exhaled 8-iso concentration increased significantly with PM2.5 
269 
exposure and decreased with O3 and O3-summer exposures.   
270 
Participants with asthma included in the present analyses were mostly recruited in chest 
271 
clinics as asthma cases, with a careful procedure set up to include true asthmatics using 
272 
standardized and validated questionnaires. Others were recruited as first-degree relatives of 
273 
asthmatic cases based on answers to questions on asthma diagnosis. This leads to a group of 
274 
asthmatics with a wide range of disease expression. In our cross-sectional analyses, cause and 
275 
consequence cannot be disentangled. It was not possible to study the associations between 
276 
outdoor air pollution and exhaled 8-iso concentration with the incidence of asthma because 
277 
only 30 new cases of asthma were reported at EGEA2. But, there is clearly a need for further 
278 
research to confirm the associations and to clarify its causal underpinnings. Regarding 
279 
exposure assessment, LUR models are well-adapted to take into account the spatial variation 
280 
of NO2, PM2.5 [19] and NOx [20], and ESCAPE resolution is accurate to estimate the 
281 
exposure to markers of road traffic which have a spatial heterogeneity. In addition, IFEN 
282 
resolution is larger than ESCAPE but suitable for O3 and O3-summer which are homogeneous 
283 
over long distances [21]. We acknowledge that a weakness of our study is the non-compliance 
284 
of the temporality because outdoor air pollution was estimated by ESCAPE between 2009 and 
285 
2010 whereas the collection of EBC and phenotype “current asthma” took place at EGEA2 
286 
between 2003 and 2007. To get a better temporality in our analyses, we used the back-
287 
extrapolated pollution estimates which were back-extrapolated at participants’ residential 
288 
address at EGEA2, and found similar results. Both back-extrapolated and non-back-
289 
extrapolated estimates were highly and significantly correlated in our study (correlation 
290 
coefficients≥0.98, P<0.001) as previously reported by Beelen et al. in the same ESCAPE 
291 
         13 
 
project and for a longer period [22]. Previously in ESCAPE study, associations between NO2 
292 
back-extrapolated estimates and asthma incidence were similar to those with non-back-
293 
extrapolated estimates [23]. We aimed to study the impact of long-term exposure to outdoor 
294 
air pollution, and therefore conducted sensitivity analyses by excluding participants who lived 
295 
less one year at the same residential address that did not change our conclusions. We cannot 
296 
exclude that some non-differential misclassification of pollution exposure may have occurred 
297 
because the time-activity patterns of participants were not available in our analyses, but in this 
298 
case, it would led to bias towards the null. Furthermore, IFEN resolution can better 
299 
represented daily participant’s exposures to O3 and O3-summer, at least for those whom work 
300 
was close to home. We could not take into account all indoor environmental factors; however, 
301 
we found similar results after further adjustment for domestic exposure to cleaning products. 
302 
Furthermore, the adjustment for the socioeconomic position potentially associated with 
303 
pollutant exposures [24] and asthma gave also similar results. The EGEA study is a case-
304 
control and family study. Participants from the same family share genetic background, and 
305 
also socio-economic and lifestyle factors, that could be associated with the exposure to 
306 
outdoor air pollution or the asthma risk. We therefore took into account familial dependence 
307 
through random effects in mixed models. Sub-groups analyses suffer from a lack of power 
308 
but, as best as possible, we used the most suitable statistical models. Finally, the EIA method 
309 
has been preferred for dosing exhaled 8-iso concentration rather the GCMS method because 
310 
the former is better adapted to analyze a larger number of samples as in our study. 
311 
We found that traffic intensity and O3 exposure increased the risk of current asthma. Our 
312 
results add evidence of the impact of long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution on asthma in 
313 
adults. Our results are partly in accordance with those of a recent study showing that traffic 
314 
exposure but not NO2 exposure, assessed by satellite-based LUR model at residential 
315 
addresses, was positively associated with current asthma in 1367 adults [25]. We also found a 
316 
         14 
 
positive association between O3 exposure and current asthma. To our knowledge, the 
317 
literature assessing outdoor air pollution effect on asthma focused mainly on other asthma 
318 
phenotypes such as asthma onset, asthma severity, or asthma control. A study conducted in 
319 
California has reported that long-term exposure to O3 was associated with development of 
320 
asthma in adult males [26]. Previously in the EGEA study, long-term exposure to O3 
321 
estimated by IFEN was associated with asthma severity [17] and with uncontrolled asthma 
322 
[27]. Recently, a cohort showed that asthmatic adults exposed to O3 had a greater risk to 
323 
develop asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [28]. Interestingly, various asthma 
324 
phenotypes were studied such as asthma-onset which reflects the initiation of the disease, and 
325 
severity and control of asthma which are linked to manifestations of the disease. Asthma 
326 
reflects both ever asthma and current asthma, and the participants with ever asthma had not 
327 
necessarily a current asthma. In the EGEA study, the phenotype “current asthma” was defined 
328 
by the report of respiratory symptoms or asthma attacks or use of inhaled and/or oral 
329 
medicines because of breathing problems in the past twelve months. To study the associations 
330 
between long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution, biological markers and asthma, the 
331 
phenotype “current asthma” was more relevant than the phenotype “ever asthma” because it 
332 
reflects the recent activity of the disease. Overall, all these findings add evidence of 
333 
associations between outdoor air pollution and asthma in adults, whatever the studied 
334 
phenotypes. 
335 
This study adds new insights into a potential role of oxidative stress in the associations 
336 
between long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution and asthma in adults. We reported a 
337 
significant association between exhaled 8-iso concentration and current asthma after 
338 
adjustment for age, sex, smoking habits and body mass index. We investigated whether other 
339 
asthma characteristics could explain this association, but we did not found any significant 
340 
association between exhaled 8-iso concentration with duration of asthma, age of asthma onset, 
341 
         15 
 
lung function, or allergic sensitization. Our results added new evidence to the previous 
342 
associations reported in the literature with asthma severity and asthma control [12]. We found 
343 
for the first time that exhaled 8-iso concentration was positively associated with PM2.5 
344 
exposure in participants without asthma. Unfortunately, we did not have back-extrapolated 
345 
data for PM2.5. In France, PM2.5 level has overall decreased between 2002 and 2012 and the 
346 
association between PM2.5 exposure and exhaled 8-iso concentration may be underestimated 
347 
[29]. The literature mainly focused on short-term exposure to outdoor air pollution and on 
348 
other biological compartments. In fact, short-term exposure to PM2.5 was previously found to 
349 
be positively associated with EBC 8-iso concentration among healthy adolescents [30], and 
350 
with 8-iso concentration in urine among adults [31]. We also found counterintuitive negative 
351 
associations between O3 and O3-summer exposures and exhaled 8-iso concentration. Our results 
352 
are not in accordance with those of a previous study showing that O3 exposure assigned to 
353 
residential location was associated with higher plasma 8-iso concentration in 120 healthy 
354 
students [32]. The inconsistency with our findings may be partially attributed to differences in 
355 
the study design, in the biological compartment, and in the spatial resolution which was less 
356 
accurate than in our study. We showed that O3 exposure and exhaled 8-iso concentration 
357 
increased the risk of current asthma, and we did not expect negative associations between O3 
358 
and O3-summer exposures and exhaled 8-iso concentration. We investigated more thoroughly 
359 
why these associations were negative. The analyses conducted by city showed that Paris 
360 
heavily weighted the negative associations between O3 and O3-summer exposures and exhaled 8-
361 
iso concentration. Previously, a study has also reported a negative association between short-
362 
term exposure to O3 and exhaled 8-iso in New Yorker’s adolescents [33]. Another explanation 
363 
is that O3 is a secondary pollutant mainly produces through complex chemical reactions from 
364 
NO2. In our study, O3 and NO2 levels were highly and negatively correlated, and NO2 
365 
exposure was also positively associated with exhaled 8-iso concentration but not significantly. 
366 
         16 
 
One hypothesis is likely that the positive association between NO2 and exhaled 8-iso partly 
367 
explained the negative associations observed for O3 and O3-summer. Overall, the specific effects 
368 
of pollutants are hard to disentangle even in bi-pollutant models given the strong correlations 
369 
between pollutants. It is interesting to note that participants from Paris had particular 
370 
characteristics as an exhaled 8-iso concentration 7 times higher, were exposed to higher levels 
371 
of road traffic, NO2 and PM, and to lower levels of O3 and O3-summer than in other cities, 
372 
suggesting that Parisians may have particular characteristics that could partly explain the 
373 
negative associations between ozone and exhaled 8-iso concentration. O3 and O3-summer were 
374 
negatively correlated with PM2.5, but the negative association between O3-summer exposure and 
375 
exhaled 8-iso concentration remained significant in a bi-pollutant model. Previously in EGEA 
376 
adults, O3 assessed by IFEN was also found to be negatively associated with the EBC total 
377 
nitrites/nitrates level, a biological marker of nitrosative stress [34]. In the literature, complex 
378 
interplays between nitrosative and oxidative stress pathways have been reported [35], 
379 
including a reciprocal regulation. An alternative explanation is that our results were likely due 
380 
to other factors that are not included in the present analyses. In all participants, only a 
381 
negative and significant association between O3-summer exposure and exhaled 8-iso 
382 
concentration was found, and no association was found in participants with current asthma. In 
383 
a directed acyclic graph (DAG), the covariate “current asthma” may be a collider, which 
384 
makes the interpretation of our results even more difficult in a context of cross-sectional 
385 
analyses [36].  
386 
Several biological mechanisms by which outdoor air pollution may be associated with asthma 
387 
have been suggested in previous reviews [37, 38]. Outdoor air pollution exposure may 
388 
increase oxidative stress in airways through the production of reactive oxygen species and 
389 
local inflammation [9].  The PM can be supports for allergens and their small size gives them 
390 
a large surface related to oxidative potential [39]. To disentangle the complexity of the 
391 
         17 
 
associations between asthma and oxidative stress, and 8-iso in particular, there is a need for 
392 
longitudinal epidemiological studies. Overall, our results add new insights of a potential role 
393 
of oxidative stress in the association between long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution and 
394 
asthma in adults. To better understand the underlying biological pathways between outdoor 
395 
air pollution and asthma, future epidemiological studies should use individual portable 
396 
sensors in order to improve the pollution assessment, study the different windows of exposure 
397 
and try to collect multiple exposures in order to identify exposure profiles through clustering 
398 
methods.  
399 
Conclusions 
400 
We found that traffic intensity, O3 exposure and exhaled 8-iso concentration increased the risk 
401 
of current asthma, and that among participants without asthma exhaled 8-iso concentration 
402 
increased with PM2.5 exposure, and decreased with O3 and O3-summer exposures. Exhaled 8-iso 
403 
seems to be an interesting oxidative stress-related biomarker adapted to epidemiological 
404 
studies. Overall, our study adds new insights in the associations between long-term exposure 
405 
to outdoor air pollution and asthma in adults, and suggests that oxidative stress may partly 
406 
explained such associations. Longitudinal studies with larger samples are now needed to 
407 
confirm such results.
