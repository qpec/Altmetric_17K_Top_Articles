Abstract
BACKGROUND—Bariatric surgery is increasingly considered for the treatment of adolescents 
with severe obesity, but few prospective adolescent-specific studies examining the efficacy and 
safety of weight-loss surgery are available to support clinical decision making.
METHODS—We prospectively enrolled 242 adolescents undergoing weight-loss surgery at five 
U.S. centers. Patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (161 participants) or sleeve 
gastrectomy (67) were included in the analysis. Changes in body weight, coexisting conditions, 
cardiometabolic risk factors, and weight-related quality of life and postoperative complications 
were evaluated through 3 years after the procedure.
RESULTS—The mean (±SD) baseline age of the participants was 17±1.6 years, and the mean 
body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 53; 
75% of the participants were female, and 72% were white. At 3 years after the procedure, the 
mean weight had decreased by 27% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25 to 29) in the total cohort, by 
28% (95% CI, 25 to 30) among participants who underwent gastric bypass, and by 26% (95% CI, 
22 to 30) among those who underwent sleeve gastrectomy. By 3 years after the procedure, 
remission of type 2 diabetes occurred in 95% (95% CI, 85 to 100) of participants who had had the 
condition at baseline, remission of abnormal kidney function occurred in 86% (95% CI, 72 to 
100), remission of prediabetes in 76% (95% CI, 56 to 97), remission of elevated blood pressure in

 74% (95% CI, 64 to 84), and remission of dyslipidemia in 66% (95% CI, 57 to 74). Weight-related 
quality of life also improved significantly. However, at 3 years after the bariatric procedure, 
hypoferritinemia was found in 57% (95% CI, 50 to 65) of the participants, and 13% (95% CI, 9 to 
18) of the participants had undergone one or more additional intraabdominal procedures.
CONCLUSIONS—In this multicenter, prospective study of bariatric surgery in adolescents, we 
found significant improvements in weight, cardiometabolic health, and weight-related quality of 
life at 3 years after the procedure. Risks associated with surgery included specific micro-nutrient 
deficiencies and the need for additional abdominal procedures. (Funded by the National Institute 
of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and others; Teen-LABS ClinicalTrials.gov 
number, NCT00474318.)
SEVERE OBESITY AFFECTS 4.4 MILLION children and adolescents in the United States,1 and few effective 
treatments are available.2 Particular concern has centered on health problems among 
severely obese adolescents and possible treatment with bariatric surgery.3 Indeed, adolescent 
bariatric surgical case volumes doubled from approximately 800 cases in 20034 to 1600 
procedures in 2009.5 Few prospective studies have examined changes in body-mass index 
(BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) and outcomes 
of the currently used surgical procedures, and little is known about clinical events after 
bariatric surgery in adolescents.6,7
To address important questions regarding the efficacy and safety of bariatric surgery in 
adolescents, the Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS) study 
collects longitudinal, prospective clinical and laboratory data on teenagers undergoing 
bariatric surgery at five centers in the United States. The current report presents data on 
weight loss, coexisting conditions, weight-related quality of life, micronutrient levels, and 
additional abdominal procedures during the 3 years after the bariatric procedure.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS
In this prospective, multicenter, observational study, we enrolled consecutive adolescents 
(≤19 years of age) who were undergoing any bariatric surgical procedure from March 2007 
through February 2012 at participating centers. The steering committee, which is made up of 
the principal investigator at each site, in collaboration with the data coordinating center and 
the project scientist from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney 
Diseases, designed and implemented the study. The protocol and statistical analysis plan are 
available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The first author wrote the first draft 
of the manuscript, and all the authors participated in critical reviews and editing. The 
protocol and data and safety monitoring plans were approved by the institutional review 
board at each institution and by a data and safety monitoring board for the study as a whole. 
All participants provided written informed consent.
DATA COLLECTION
The standardized methods we used for data collection have been described previously.8,9 
Follow-up data were collected at the 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year postoperative

 research visits. Most visits occurred at the clinical centers or at the participant's home; in 22 
instances, assessments were conducted through self-report (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available at NEJM.org). Research coordinators, nurse practitioners, and 
physicians were trained in protocol procedures for the collection of data. For home visits, a 
field examiner who was trained in protocol procedures conducted a visit at the participant's 
residence. Data collected during study visits were maintained in a central database by the 
data coordinating center. Missed visits did not necessarily indicate withdrawal from the 
study, because participants commonly returned for later visits even after missing a visit. 
Weight-related quality of life was assessed with the use of the total score from the Impact of 
Weight on Quality of Life–Kids10 instrument (scores range from 0 to 100, with higher 
scores indicating a better quality of life).
DEFINITIONS
Standard conventions were followed for the assessment of prevalence, remission, and 
incidence of coexisting conditions, and micronutrients were measured as described in the 
Supplementary Appendix. Information on additional surgical and endoscopic procedures 
that were performed between 31 days after bariatric surgery and the 3-year study visit was 
collected with the use of a scripted interview at each visit.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
A complete description of the statistical methods is provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix. Weight loss, quality of life, coexisting conditions, and micronutrient outcomes 
were evaluated with the use of linear mixed and generalized mixed models, with separate 
models according to surgical procedure. Each model included only the study visit as the 
independent predictor term. Estimates of least-squares means and 95% confidence intervals 
were generated. These models addressed missing data values by means of the maximum-
likelihood method, under the data-missing-at-random assumption. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed to evaluate this assumption. Using linear interpolation, we generated body-weight 
values from the values at previous and subsequent visits. For weights that were missing at 
the 3-year follow-up visit, we applied a conservative 10% increase from the latest visit. On 
the basis of these analyses, the missing-at-random assumption was considered to be 
reasonable (see the Supplementary Appendix).
Event rates for subsequent abdominal procedures were calculated as the number of events 
that occurred from 31 days after the procedure through the 3-year study visit (visit window, 
2.5 to 3.5 years), divided by person-years of observation. Poisson regression with the 
logarithm of person-years as an offset parameter was used to calculate unadjusted rates and 
95% confidence intervals (expressed per 300 person-years).
RESULTS
PARTICIPANTS
We enrolled 242 participants in the study; 161 (67%) underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 
67 (28%) underwent sleeve gastrectomy, and 14 (6%) underwent adjustable gastric banding. 
Because of the small size of the gastric-band cohort, these results were not included in the

 main analyses (see the Supplementary Appendix). At baseline, 29% of the participants were 
in the early teenage age groups (13 to 15 years of age), 41% were in the middle age groups 
(16 to 17 years of age), and 30% were in the late age groups (18 to 19 years of age) (Table 
1). The mean BMI was 53 (range, 34 to 88); 98% of the participants had a BMI higher than 
40. The majority of participants were from families with household incomes of less than 
$50,000 per year. The majority of caregivers had completed high school, and 40% had 
obtained some college education.
Through the 3-year study end point, 99% of the cohort (225 of 228 participants) participated 
actively and completed 88% of all postoperative visits (805 of 912 visits) (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The rates of visit completion according to follow-up time point 
were 89% at 6 months (203 of 228 participants), 90% at 1 year (205 of 228), 89% at 2 years 
(203 of 228), and 85% at 3 years (194 of 228). A total of 89% of the postoperative visits 
(715 of 805) were completed at the clinical center and 8% (68 of 805) were conducted at the 
participant's home; 3% (22 of 805) were self-reported assessments conducted through 
telephone contact or electronic correspondence.
ANTHROPOMETRIC CHANGES
At 3 years, the mean weight reduction among all participants was 41 kg, with little increase 
in height (Table 1). The mean percent weight loss was 27% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
25 to 29) in the overall cohort: 28% (95% CI, 25 to 30; P<0.001) in the group that 
underwent gastric bypass and 26% (95% CI, 22 to 30; P<0.001) in the group that underwent 
sleeve gastrectomy (Fig. 1A). The magnitude of BMI reduction was nearly identical to that 
of weight reduction (Table 1, and Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Sensitivity 
analyses indicated that missing values had a negligible effect on the results for weight loss 
(Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). At baseline, all the participants were obese (BMI 
>30), whereas at 3 years, 26% of the participants were no longer obese (Fig. S3A and S3B 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The proportion of participants who had a 10% or greater 
reduction in BMI was 89% among participants who underwent gastric bypass and 85% 
among participants who underwent sleeve gastrectomy. At 3 years, 2% of the participants 
who underwent gastric bypass and 4% of those who underwent sleeve gastrectomy exceeded 
their baseline weight.
COEXISTING CONDITIONS AND WEIGHT-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE
Elevated blood pressure was present in 96 participants at baseline, and at 3 years after 
bariatric surgery, blood pressure had normalized in 74% of the participants (95% CI, 64 to 
84) who had had the condition at baseline and for whom data were available (Table 2, and 
Fig. S3C in the Supplementary Appendix). Four incident cases of elevated blood pressure 
were observed among the 98 participants with available data who had not had the condition 
at baseline (4%; 95% CI, 0 to 8]). Dyslipidemia was present in 171 participants at baseline; 
at 3 years, lipid levels had normalized (without lipid-lowering therapy) in 66% of the 
participants (95% CI, 57 to 74) who had had the condition at baseline and for whom data 
were available (P<0.001) (Table 2 and Fig. 1B, and Fig. S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Among the 39 participants with available data who had not had dyslipidemia at 
baseline, 3 incident cases had developed by 3 years (8%; 95% CI, 0 to 16). At 3 years,

 resolution of abnormal kidney function (defined by low glomerular filtration rate or 
proteinuria) was observed in 86% (95% CI, 72 to 100) of the participants with available data 
who had had this condition at baseline, and 12 incident cases of abnormal kidney function 
had developed among the 124 participants with data who had not had the condition at 
baseline (10%; 95% CI, 5 to 15).
A total of 32 participants had diabetes at baseline; 3 of these participants had type 1 
diabetes, and no participants with type 1 diabetes had resolution of the condition after the 
surgical procedure. At baseline, among the 29 participants (13% of all participants) who had 
type 2 diabetes, the median glycated hemoglobin level was 6.3%, the median fasting glucose 
level was 110 mg per deciliter (6.1 mmol per liter), and the median insulin level was 43 IU 
per milliliter. At 3 years, 19 of 20 participants (95%; 95% CI, 85 to 100) with data that could 
be evaluated were in remission (Table 2), with a median glycated hemoglobin of 5.3%, a 
median fasting glucose of 88 mg per deciliter (4.9 mmol per liter), and a median insulin 
level of 12 IU per milliliter. No incident cases of diabetes were observed. Prediabetes was 
found in 19 participants (10%; 95% CI, 6 to 14) at baseline; of the participants for whom 
data were available, 76% (95% CI, 56 to 97) no longer had prediabetes at 3 years. Incident 
prediabetes had developed in 1 participant by 3 years.
We found improvements in participant-reported weight-related quality of life from baseline 
to the 3-year follow-up. The mean quality-of-life total score was 63 (95% CI, 61 to 65) at 
baseline and had increased to 83 (95% CI, 81 to 86) by 3 years (P<0.001) (Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
NUTRITIONAL MEASURES
Low ferritin levels were found in 5% (95% CI, 2 to 8) of the participants at baseline, but at 3 
years, 57% (95% CI, 50 to 65) had abnormally low levels (P<0.001). Vitamin B12 levels 
declined by 35% (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix), and 8% of the participants had 
a deficiency at 3 years (Table 3). Deficiencies in vitamin A (levels <301 μg per liter) were 
found at baseline in 6% (95% CI, 2 to 9) of the participants who underwent gastric bypass; 
at 3 years, vitamin A deficiencies were found in 16% of participants who underwent this 
procedure (95% CI, 9 to 24; P = 0.008). Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were insufficient 
(<20.1 ng per milliliter) in 37% of the participants (95% CI, 31 to 44) before the surgical 
procedure and did not increase significantly over time.
COMPLICATIONS AND DEATHS
Within 3 years, 47 intraabdominal procedures were performed in 30 participants (13% [95% 
CI, 9 to 18]) (Table 4). Three procedures (1 appendicostomy and 2 appendectomies) were 
unrelated to the previous bariatric procedure, whereas all others were considered to be 
related to the procedure. A total of 24% of the procedures were performed within the first 
year after the bariatric procedure, 55% within the second year, and 21% within third year. 
Upper endoscopic procedures (including stricture dilations) were performed in 29 
participants (13%). One participant with known type 1 diabetes died 3.3 years after gastric 
bypass surgery, from complications of a hypoglycemic event.

 DISCUSSION
A majority of participants in our study had marked improvements with respect to weight, 
obesity-related coexisting conditions, and quality of life. The emergence of specific 
micronutrient deficiencies and the need for subsequent abdominal procedures indicate that 
there are also risks associated with bariatric surgery in this age group.
The outcomes of bariatric surgery among adolescents beyond 1 year after the procedure 
have rarely been described.11,12 The mean decrease in BMI after 1 year among Teen-LABS 
participants who underwent gastric bypass was similar to that reported in seven previous 
studies involving 256 adolescents (decreases of 16.5 and 17.2, respectively).11-17 In a study 
involving 53 younger adolescents (mean age, 14 years), a decrease of 20 in mean BMI and 
an increase of 5 cm in mean height was observed 3 years after sleeve gastrectomy.18 This 
decrease in BMI was greater than the decrease of 13.1 that was observed among participants 
who underwent sleeve gastrectomy in our study, probably in part because of the linear 
growth in the younger cohort, which was not seen in our cohort. In aggregate, these results 
suggest that adolescents can lose a clinically significant amount of weight after bariatric 
surgery, with the majority of patients maintaining meaningful weight loss for at least 3 
years.
Among adults who undergo gastric bypass, remission of type 2 diabetes occurs in 50 to 
70%, and remission of elevated blood pressure occurs in 40%.19,20 We found remission of 
diabetes in 95% of participants who had type 2 diabetes at baseline in our study, a finding 
consistent with our previous findings in adolescents.21 This result, coupled with the findings 
of normalization of elevated blood pressure in nearly 80% of our participants, leads us to 
hypothesize that adolescents may have a greater potential than adults for reversal of the 
cardiometabolic consequences of obesity. We further speculate that these improvements 
with regard to weight, glycemic control, blood pressure, and dyslipidemia in adolescents 
may mitigate the progression of adverse anatomical and physiological cardiovascular 
changes — changes that may be less reversible after the accumulation of more pound-years 
later in life.22 Additional research may clarify the way in which age, obesity duration, and 
the timing of surgery could modify the response to surgical treatment.
Gastric bypass and gastric resection may affect the absorption of numerous micronutrients 
that are necessary for normal metabolism and for good bone, hematologic, and nervous 
system health; therefore, multivitamin and mineral supplementation is needed, as was 
prescribed in this cohort. The greatest changes that we observed were in measures related to 
iron and vitamin B12. Iron-deficiency anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency after gastric 
bypass are well described.23,24 Vitamin B12 deficiency was not unexpected after sleeve 
gastrectomy, and it presumably relates to a reduction in intrinsic factor production after the 
procedure. These results, as well as the decreased vitamin A levels after gastric-bypass 
surgery, highlight the importance of long-term follow-up to evaluate nutritional measures, as 
well as the importance of ensuring that appropriate supplementation is provided to minimize 
the development of clinically significant nutritional deficiencies in adolescents after bariatric 
surgery.

 There are currently few available data regarding the need for subsequent abdominal 
operations after bariatric surgery in adolescents. Our data, which include information on 
additional conditions and procedures, may elucidate the types and frequencies of the adverse 
effects of bariatric surgery in this age group. Previously, we reported that 8% of the 
participants in our study had major complications within 30 days after the bariatric 
procedure,9 and here we report that 13% of the participants underwent additional 
intraabdominal procedures within the subsequent 3 years. The risks of complications may 
differ according to the type of bariatric procedure; however, the current study was not 
designed to identify such differences. Further study of larger cohorts and other populations 
may provide insight regarding this question.
The strengths of the current study include the prospective enrollment of consecutive patients 
at geographically distinct sites, the standardized methods used to collect data, and strong 
cohort maintenance over time. The limitations of our study include the small size of certain 
important subpopulations, such as patients with diabetes. In addition, the observational 
nature of the study introduces heterogeneity into the data set, including unmeasured 
covariates and imbalances in race, sex, and socioeconomic status. Without a non–surgically 
treated control group, it is difficult to place the postoperative changes in weight and health 
status completely into perspective, since behavioral treatment can result in modest 
improvements in weight and cardiometabolic health. However, it has been reported that 
severely obese adolescents who undergo nonsurgical treatment do not have major reductions 
in weight, and the reductions that they do have are not maintained over 2 years of follow-
up.25 Finally, despite a relatively low 3-year missed-visit rate of 15%, missing data — 
particularly data from laboratory testing, which were missing in 24% of participants — is a 
limitation. However, statistical techniques that address missing data were applied, and 
sensitivity analyses indicated that our assumptions with regard to patterns of missing data 
were reasonable.
In conclusion, we documented the durability of clinically meaningful weight loss and 
improvements in key health conditions and weight-related quality of life among adolescents 
who underwent gastric bypass surgery or sleeve gastrectomy. These benefits must be viewed 
in the context of the risks of micronutrient deficiencies and the possibility that future 
abdominal procedures will be needed in some patients. Studies that assess the longer-term 
durability of weight loss, potential improvements with respect to coexisting conditions, and 
the risk of adverse events, as well as the cost, may provide a better understanding of the role 
of bariatric surgery in the treatment of severe obesity in adolescents.

 Figure 1. Weight Changes and Prevalence of Dyslipidemia during the 3-Year Period after 
Bariatric Surgery
Panel A shows the modeled least-squares mean percent changes in weight from baseline at 
each study visit during the 3 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (bypass) or 
vertical sleeve gastrectomy (sleeve). Panel B shows the modeled least-squares mean 
prevalences of dyslipidemia at each study visit during the 3 years after Roux-en-Y gastric 
bypass surgery (bypass) or vertical sleeve gastrectomy (sleeve). I bars in both panels 
represent 95% confidence intervals.

*The criteria used to define each coexisting condition are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
†Generalized mixed models were used to calculate the modeled results.
‡The proportion of participants in remission was calculated as the number of participants (among those for whom sufficient data were available at 3 years to determine whether the co-existing condition was 
present) who did not have the condition at 3 years after the procedure, divided by the number of participants (among those for whom sufficient data were available at 3 years to define whether the coexisting 
condition was present) who had had the condition at baseline.
