Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Alcohol consumption is inversely associated
with diabetes, but little is known about the role of drinking
patterns. We examined the association between alcohol drink-
ing patterns and diabetes risk in men and women from the
general Danish population.
Methods This cohort study was based on data from the
Danish Health Examination Survey 2007–2008. Of the
76,484 survey participants, 28,704 men and 41,847 women
were eligible for this study. Participants were followed for a
median of 4.9 years. Self-reported questionnaires were used to
obtain information on alcohol drinking patterns, i.e. frequency
of alcohol drinking, frequency of binge drinking, and con-
sumption of wine, beer and spirits, from which we calculated
beverage-specific and overall average weekly alcohol intake.
Information on incident cases of diabetes was obtained from
the Danish National Diabetes Register. Cox proportional haz-
ards model was applied to estimate HRs and 95% CIs.
Results During follow-up, 859 men and 887 women devel-
oped diabetes. The lowest risk of diabetes was observed at 14
drinks/week in men (HR 0.57 [95% CI 0.47, 0.70]) and at 9
drinks/week in women (HR 0.42 [95% CI 0.35, 0.51]),
relative to no alcohol intake. Compared with current alcohol
consumers consuming <1 day/week, consumption of alcohol
on 3–4 days weekly was associated with significantly lower
risk for diabetes in men (HR 0.73 [95% CI 0.59, 0.94]) and
women (HR 0.68 [95% CI 0.53, 0.88]) after adjusting for
confounders and average weekly alcohol amount.
Conclusions/interpretation Our findings suggest that alcohol
drinking frequency is associated with risk of diabetes and that
consumption of alcohol over 3–4 days per week is associated
with the lowest risk of diabetes, even after taking average
weekly alcohol consumption into account.

Introduction
Epidemiological studies have consistently suggested that light
to moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a lower
risk for diabetes compared with abstention in men [1–5] and
women [1–6]. Heavy consumption is, on the other hand, as-
sociated with a risk equal to [7] or greater than [8] that of
abstainers. However, results from the few prospective studies
which have examined the role of drinking patterns, such as
frequency, binge drinking (i.e. consuming large amounts of
alcohol per occasion) and beverage type, in relation to type
2 diabetes are inconsistent. Frequent alcohol consumption,
compared with alcohol consumption concentrated over a few

 days, has been suggested to convey lower risks of diabetes,
even if the alcohol amount consumed per drinking day is low,
implying that frequency is more important than amount [9,
10]. However, other studies have shown that frequent alcohol
consumption is not associated with lower risks of diabetes
when adjusting for total alcohol amount [8, 11]. Another area
that needs to be further addressed is whether the potential
beneficial effect of alcohol on the risk of diabetes pertains to
specific beverage types. Although wine has been suggested to
have particularly protective effects in relation to type 2 diabe-
tes [12, 13], epidemiological studies are inconclusive when it
comes to the specific effects of beer and spirits [13–15]. In
addition, binge drinking has been associated with an increased
risk of type 2 diabetes among men [8, 16] and women [17],
while others have reported a tendency of reduced risk associ-
ated with binge drinking [18].
Diverging findings from previous studies may have several
explanations: for example, using different definitions of alco-
hol drinking patterns and various combinations of alcohol
drinking frequency and amount in relation to the risk type 2
diabetes makes it difficult to compare studies. However, de-
spite differences in methods, the results imply the importance
of alcohol drinking patterns in addition to quantity consumed.
To address these issues, we investigated the association be-
tween alcohol drinking patterns and the risk of diabetes among
men and women from the general Danish population.
Methods
The Danish Health Examination Survey Data from the
Danish Health Examination Survey (DANHES) from 2007
to 2008 was used [19]. DANHES was conducted in 13 of 98
municipalities in Denmark, where all citizens in the participat-
ing municipalities aged ≥18 years were invited to complete a
self-reported questionnaire comprising items on lifestyle,
health and morbidity. In 12 municipalities, an internet-based
questionnaire was used, whereas a paper-based questionnaire
was used in the remaining municipality. Overall 538,497 peo-
ple were invited and 76,484 participated (14%). The personal
identification number—a unique ten-digit number assigned to
each Danish citizen—enabled linkage to Danish nationwide
registries from where information on social factors, morbidity
and mortality was obtained.
Alcohol drinking patterns Lifetime abstainers were defined
as individuals, who reported never drinking alcohol, and cur-
rent abstainers were defined as individuals with a history of
drinking alcohol, but who had not drunk alcohol within the
last year. Respondents who had been drinking alcohol within
the last year were asked about their alcohol drinking pattern.
Information on frequency of alcohol drinking was reported as:
<1 day/week; 1–2 days/week; 3–4 days/week; or 5–7 days/
week. Participants were asked about frequency of binge drink-
ing (≥5 beverages/occasion), which was reported as: never;
<1 day/week; 1 day/week; or >1 day/week. Furthermore, par-
ticipants were asked to report, in drinks, their average daily
consumption of wine, beer and spirits during the seven week-
days. One Danish standard drink corresponds to 12 g ethanol.
Based on average weekly alcohol consumption of specific
beverage types, we calculated beverage-specific and the over-
all average weekly alcohol amount. The beverage-specific al-
cohol amount was coded as: <1 drink/week; 1–6 drinks/week;
≥7 drinks/week (women); 7–13 drinks/week (men); or ≥14
drinks/week (men). Last, participants were asked whether
their consumption of alcohol within the last 5 years had been
decreasing, increasing or stable.
Diabetes Information on diabetes during follow-up was ob-
tained from the Danish National Diabetes Register, which
comprises all incident cases of diabetes diagnosed in
Denmark from 1991 and onwards [20]. The registry uses five
diagnostic criteria: (1) hospitalisation with a diagnosis of dia-
betes according to the ICD 8th or 10th Revisions (ICD-8
codes 249 or 250; ICD-10 codes E10-14, H36.0 or O24 [ex-
cluding O24.4], www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/)
obtained from the Danish National Patient Registry; (2) reg-
istration of chiropody (coded for diabetes) in the Danish
National Health Service Register; (3) registration in the
Danish National Health Service Register with measurement
of blood glucose five or more times within 365 days; (4) two
or more annual measurements of glucose during a 5 year pe-
riod; or (5) registration in the Danish National Prescription
Registry with prescription of insulin or oral glucose-
lowering medication on at least two occasions. If one of these
criteria is met, an individual is registered as having diabetes.
The register does not distinguish between type 1 and type 2
diabetes. Participants were followed up for diabetes in the
register to December 2012.
Covariates Based on the literature, we considered the follow-
ing as confounders: age, sex, BMI (calculated as kg/m2) as a
linear and squared term, education, smoking status (never
smoker, former smoker, occasional smoker or daily smoker),
diet, leisure-time physical activity, hypertension (current or
previous) and family history of diabetes. All covariates except
age and sex were based on self-report in DANHES. Level of
school education was defined according to the International
Standard Classification of Education, combining ongoing or
completed school and vocational education and divided
into: <10 years; 10–12 years; 13–14 years; or ≥15 years.
Information on diet was based on five questions about intake
of: (1) fibre-rich bread or grain; (2) boiled, fried or baked
vegetables; (3) salad; (4) fruit; and (5) fish at dinner. For each
of diet questions 1–4, respondents were coded as infrequent
eaters if they ate the respective food never/very infrequently,
1942
Diabetologia (2017) 60:1941–1950
 <1 time/week, 1 time/week, or a couple of times/week.
Respondents were coded as frequent eaters if they ate the food
almost every day, or every day/more than once a day. For diet
question 5, respondents were categorised as infrequent eaters
if they ate fish for dinner never/very infrequent or <1
time/week. Otherwise they were reported as frequent eaters.
Leisure-time physical activity during the last year was
assessed based on a measure developed by Saltin and
Grimby [21], with the following response categories: (1) vig-
orous (strenuous activities usually involving competition or
endurance training performed regularly or several times a
week); (2) moderate (exercise, endurance training or heavy
gardening for at least 4 h a week); (3) light (walking, cycling
or other light activities for a minimum of 4 h a week); or (4)
inactive (reading, TV watching or other sedentary activities).
Respondents were categorised as having a family history of
diabetes if they reported having a mother, father and/or full
brothers and sisters with diabetes.
Final study population We excluded participants with a di-
agnosis of diabetes at baseline (date of participation in
DANHES) by linkage to the Danish National Diabetes
Register (n = 3079) or if they reported a history of diabetes
in DANHES (n = 543). Women who were pregnant at baseline
or had given birth within the last 6 months from baseline were
excluded (n = 894), based on the assumption that women
reduce their alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
Furthermore, we excluded participants with no information
about whether they had been drinking alcohol within the last
year (n = 783), how often they consumed alcohol (n = 460) or
how often they binge drank (n = 174). The final study popu-
lation comprised 70,551 individuals (28,704 men and 41,847
women).
Statistical analyses Through linkage to the Danish Civil
Registration System we obtained information concerning time
of death and emigration. Participants were followed from
baseline until diagnosis of diabetes (n = 1746), emigration
(n = 454), death (n = 1254) or 29 December 2012
(n = 67,097), whichever occurred first. The total observation
time comprised 342,349 person-years, and both men and
women were followed for a median of 4.9 years (range = 0.0–
5.8 years).
To account for missing values for potential confounders,
we performed multiple imputation by chained equations with
20 repetitions. The imputation model included variables that
were hypothesised to predict missing information (age, sex
and diabetes). The numbers of missing values were 1944
(physical activity), 61 (smoking), 152 (vegetables), 182 (sal-
ad), 182 (fruit), 192 (fibre-rich bread or grain), 194 (fish),
1953 (beer, wine and spirits), 2460 (BMI), 4110 (school edu-
cation), 4682 (hypertension) and 5815 (family history of
diabetes).
Data were analysed by means of the Cox proportional haz-
ards regression model to estimate HRs and 95% CIs for the
risk of developing diabetes. Age (in days) was used as the
underlying time axis, which ensured maximal adjustment for
confounding by age. All analyses were carried out separately
for men and women, as the literature suggests sex differences
in the relationship between alcohol consumption and risk of
type 2 diabetes [6, 22]. Further, preliminary analyses of data
suggested interactions between sex and several of the inde-
pendent variables and the outcome. The assumption of pro-
portional hazards was tested graphically and in statistical tests
and the assumption was found to be fulfilled for all models.
Curvilinear associations between alcohol variables and diabe-
tes were examined by numerical recoding of the median value
within categories of the examined alcohol variables and
adding these as continuous variables to the models. Lifetime
and current abstainers were excluded from the analysis testing
for trend. In the analyses of frequency of binge drinking and
beverage type, abstainers were not included in the tests.
To examine the continuous measure of average weekly
alcohol amount, a restricted cubic spline model, using three
knots (values were 1, 8 and 22 for men, and 0, 4 and 13 for
women), was fitted [23]. A nested log likelihood test was
performed to compare a model with three knots with a model
with four knots. There was no statistically significant differ-
ence between the two in the prediction of the relationship
between alcohol and risk for diabetes; hence the model with
three knots was applied. The reference level was set at 0
drinks/week (comprising individuals consuming 0 drinks/
week, current abstainers and lifetime abstainers). As cubic
spline models are sensitive to outliers, we excluded partici-
pants with an average weekly alcohol amount above the 99th
centile, corresponding to 40 drinks/week in men and 28
drinks/week in women.
To test for interaction between drinking frequency and al-
cohol amount we used a nested log likelihood test where we
compared a model containing the variables as single terms
with a model including the interaction terms.
Because BMI is most likely both a confounder and a me-
diator in the association between alcohol consumption and
type 2 diabetes [2], we conducted multivariate analyses where
BMI was not included as a covariate in order to examine how
this affected the results.
We performed sensitivity analyses where the effects of av-
erage weekly alcohol amount and frequency of alcohol con-
sumption on the risk of diabetes were tested. First, we exclud-
ed participants who had reduced or increased their alcohol
consumption within the last 5 years of baseline. Second, as
the Danish National Diabetes Register does not contain infor-
mation about diabetes type, and incidence of type 2 diabetes
rises from middle life, we performed a sensitivity analysis
based on participants aged 40 years or above at baseline.
Furthermore, as suggested by others [24], a sensitivity
Diabetologia (2017) 60:1941–1950
1943
 analysis was performed where criteria 3 (measurement of
blood glucose five or more times within 365 days) and 4
(two or more annual measurements of glucose during a 5 year
period) in the Danish National Diabetes Register were not
used as indicators of diabetes. This was because of a suspicion
that a large proportion of the individuals included in the
Danish National Diabetes Register based on these criteria do
not have clinically diagnosed diabetes [24].
The significance level was set to a p value of 0.05 (two-
sided). Analyses were performed using SAS Software
Enterprise Guide version 5.1, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA
and STATA version 14.2, StataCorp TX, USA. All study par-
ticipants gave their informed consent to the research, and the
publication of results was approved by the Danish Data
Protection Agency.
Results
Alcohol drinking characteristics of the study population
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study population ac-
cording to frequency of alcohol drinking. Among alcohol
drinkers, the median weekly alcohol amount was eight and
four drinks in men and women, respectively. The median
weekly alcohol amount and the fraction of weekly binge
drinkers increased with increasing frequency of alcohol drink-
ing. The distribution of the consumption of beer, wine and
spirits differed across the groups of alcohol drinking frequen-
cy; beer constituted about half of the total amount of alcohol
consumed in men drinking <1 day/week and 1–2 days/week,
while wine comprised half of the total alcohol intake among
men who drank alcohol on 3–4 days/week or more. In women,
wine constituted more than half of the total alcohol intake
across all frequency groups, with a higher percentage concur-
rently with increasing alcohol drinking frequency.
Average weekly alcohol amount Among the 70,551 study
participants, 859 men and 887 women developed diabetes
during follow-up, corresponding to an incidence rate of dia-
betes of 619 and 436 per 100,000 person-years, respectively
(p < 0.0001 for sex difference).
The restricted cubic spline curves of the continuous alcohol
amount variable confirmed a U-shaped association between
average weekly alcohol amount and diabetes risk for men
(Fig. 1a) and women (Fig. 1b). The lowest risk of diabetes
was observed at 14 drinks/week in men (HR 0.57 [95% CI
0.47, 0.70]) and 9 drinks/week in women (HR 0.42 [95% CI
0.35, 0.51]). We investigated the association between average
weekly alcohol amount up to 40 drinks/week in men and 28
drinks/week in women with the risk of developing diabetes.
Within these levels of alcohol consumption, the risk of diabe-
tes did not exceed the risk of the reference level.
Frequency of alcohol drinking Table 2 shows the relative
risks of diabetes according to frequency of alcohol drinking.
When adjusting for confounders and average weekly alcohol
amount, only consumption of alcohol 3–4 days/week was sig-
nificant, with HR 0.73 (95% CI 0.59, 0.94) and 0.68 (95% CI
0.53, 0.88) in men and women, respectively. Among women,
lifetime abstainers had a higher risk of diabetes (HR 1.77
[95% CI 1.25, 2.51]), when compared with consumption
<1 day/week (Table 2).
We examined the absolute risks of diabetes by the joint
effect of frequency of alcohol drinking and average weekly
alcohol amount (Table 3). When adjusting for confounders,
men’s consumption of 7–13 drinks or ≥14 drinks over 3–
4 days/week was associated with HR 0.72 (95% CI 0.54,
0.96) and 0.62 (95% CI 0.43, 0.88), respectively. Further,
men consuming ≥14 drinks over 5–7 weekdays also had a
lower risk of diabetes (HR 0.75 [95% CI 0.61, 0.92]).
Among women, consumption of 1–6 drinks (HR 0.64 [95%
CI 0.45, 0.93]) and ≥7 drinks (HR 0.72 [95% CI 0.55, 0.95])
consumed over 3–4 days/week was associated with a lower
risk of diabetes. No significant associations were found for
other combinations of frequency of alcohol drinking and av-
erage weekly alcohol amount.
No statistically significant interaction was found between
drinking frequency and alcohol intake on risk of diabetes
(men, p = 0.533; women, p = 0.408).
Cubic splines models of the association between alcohol
intake and diabetes did not change noticeably when BMI was
excluded from the model. However, some of the estimates for
frequency of alcohol drinking and diabetes became signifi-
cant; e.g. the HRs for diabetes in men consuming alcohol on
1–2 days/week and 5–7 days/week were 0.77 (95% CI 0.62,
0.94) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.57, 0.89). The corresponding HRs
for women were 0.74 (95% CI 0.62, 0.89) and 0.65 (95% CI
0.49, 0.85) (data not shown).
Frequency of binge drinking and beverage type We found
no clear evidence of an association between binge
drinking and risk of diabetes (electronic supplementary
material [ESM] Table 1). ESM Table 2 shows the re-
sults of the analyses of average weekly intake of beer,
wine and spirits on the risk of diabetes. Consumption of
1–6 drinks of beer/week was significantly associated
with a lower risk of diabetes in men (HR 0.79 [95%
CI 0.67, 0.94]). In addition, men who consumed ≥7
drinks of wine/week had around a 30% lower risk of
diabetes compared with men drinking <1 drink of
wine/week. We found no statistically significant associ-
ation between average weekly alcohol amount of spirits
and diabetes in men. In women, however, drinking ≥7
drinks of spirits/week was associated with HR 1.83
(95% CI 1.29, 2.58) compared with women drinking
<1 drink of spirits/week. Also, women drinking one

 drink or more of wine/week had a lower risk of diabe-
tes when compared with women drinking <1 drink of
wine/week.
Sensitivity analyses Sensitivity analyses were performed in
which we tested the effects of average weekly alcohol amount
and frequency of alcohol consumption on the risk of diabetes
(data not shown). First, we excluded participants who had
reduced (n = 14,711) or increased (n = 7302) their alcohol
consumption within the last 5 years; this did not change the
estimates noticeably. Second, excluding participants under the
age of 40 did not change the results. Last, we omitted criteria 3
and 4 in the Danish National Diabetes Register as indicators of
diabetes, as suggested by others [24]; this did not change the
estimates noticeably.
Discussion
Among 28,704 men and 41,847 women from the general
Danish population, 859 men and 887 developed diabetes dur-
ing follow-up. We found that light to moderate alcohol con-
sumption was associated with a lower risk of diabetes, relative
to no alcohol consumption. Our results indicate that frequent
alcohol consumption is associated with the lowest risk of di-
abetes, even after taking average weekly alcohol consumption
into account.
Our findings should be interpreted in the context of the
existing literature. In the present study, we observed the
lowest risks of diabetes at 14 and 9 drinks/week in men
and women, respectively. Other epidemiological studies
have suggested that consumers of moderate levels of alco-
hol have a lower risk of type 2 diabetes compared with
non-drinkers [4, 6, 25]. In this study, frequent alcohol
consumption, compared with less frequent consumption,
was associated with a lower risk of diabetes. Previously,
frequent consumption has been reported to convey the
lowest risk of diabetes, even though the amount of alcohol
consumed per drinking occasion is low [9, 10]. However,
infrequent drinkers with low average alcohol consumption
are shown to drink more during drinking days and have
unfavourable risk factor profiles in relation to cardiovas-
cular disease and mortality when compared with more fre-
quent drinkers [26]. This suggests that confounding may
contribute to the favourable associations often associated
with moderate alcohol consumption and high drinking fre-
quency. Furthermore, alcohol amount consumed per
drinking occasion has been proposed to be more important
in relation to risk of type 2 diabetes than drinking frequen-
cy [8]. In this study, we did not find evidence of an asso-
ciation between binge drinking and risk of diabetes; this
could be because of low statistical power, as few partici-
pants, especially women, binge drank at least once a week.
Previously, conflicting results have been reported showing
that binge drinking increases the risk of type 2 diabetes in
men, but not women [8, 10, 11, 16], and, vice versa, dou-
bling the risk of diabetes in women but with no association
in men [17]. The use of different definitions of binge
drinking across studies and different drinking cultures
across cultures contributes to the conflicting results.
Regarding beverage type, our analyses suggest a lower
risk of diabetes associated with a moderate to high intake
of wine and, among women, a higher risk of diabetes as-
sociated with a high intake of spirits. The association be-
tween wine consumption and diabetes is in line with find-
ings from a meta-analysis based on 13 prospective studies,
in which wine consumption was associated with a signif-
icantly lower risk of type 2 diabetes: 20% risk reduction at
20–30 g pure alcohol/day [12]. One possible biological
explanation of the protective effect of wine is that poly-
phenols, natural phytochemical compounds found in red
wine, may exert beneficial effects on blood glucose con-
trol, and thereby lowering the risk of type 2 diabetes [27].
This study has several important strengths. First, the
large study population consisted of men and women
with a wide age range from the general population. In
addition, alcohol drinking patterns were assessed
through detailed questions. We were able to distinguish
lifetime from current abstainers, an important step as the
latter might have given up alcohol drinking because of
health problems, whereas other motives can be speculat-
ed for lifetime abstainers. Often former drinkers are in-
cluded in the abstainer reference group, which might

 bias drinking risk downward, thereby magnifying the
appearance of health benefits associated with low-level
drinking [28]. Linkage to national registers ensured pre-
cise follow-up. We were also able to adjust for multiple
potential confounding variables, such as sex, age, BMI,
dietary factors, family history of diabetes, hypertension,
physical activity, school education and smoking, in our
analysis. Last, it is a strength that the results did not
change in the sensitivity analysis we performed.
This study has limitations that must be considered in
the interpretation of the findings. First, some misclassi-
fication of drinking patterns may have occurred, as al-
cohol consumption is generally underreported. However,
when participants are asked about intake of beer, wine
and spirits separately, the most realistic levels of intake
are reported [29]. In addition, information about alcohol
drinking pattern was collected prior to diagnosis of di-
abetes and we therefore expect potential misclassifica-
tion to be non-differential and not a concern in the
interpretation of the results. Second, a small number of
cases of diabetes were observed in participants who
drank ≥7 drinks/week of beer or spirits, which affected
the statistical power of these analyses, including the
testing for trend. Third, alcohol drinking patterns were
assessed at a single point, despite the fact that most
individuals change alcohol drinking patterns over time.
We cannot therefore rule out that some participants
changed drinking patterns during follow-up. Fourth, we
were not able to distinguish between type 1 and type 2
diabetes. Sensitivity analysis excluding participants
younger than 40 years did not change our results and,
although one-third of people with type 1 diabetes are
diagnosed after age 30 years, the majority of individuals
identified with diabetes during follow-up most likely
had type 2 diabetes. Last, information on diet, which
is a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes, was based
on dichotomised measures of frequency of intake of five
common food items. This measure might be too simple
to reflect the complexity of dietary habits. Other mea-
sures, such as food frequency questionnaires combined
with dietary records, have been suggested to obtain
more accurate estimates of dietary intake than those ob-
tained using individual methods [30].
In conclusion, we found support for a non-linear re-
lationship between alcohol consumption and risk of di-
abetes in men and women from the general population.
Our results further indicate that frequent consumption of
alcohol is associated with the lowest risk of diabetes,
even after taking average weekly alcohol consumption
into account.
