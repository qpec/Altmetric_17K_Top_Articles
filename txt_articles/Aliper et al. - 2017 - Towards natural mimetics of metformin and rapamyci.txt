INTRODUCTION 
 
By 2030, the US Census Bureau projects that one in 
five people in the US alone will be over the age of 65 
[1], a major risk factor for many of the most prevalent, 
costly, and devastating diseases of today, including 
cancer, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and 
Type II diabetes [2]. To offset the burden of this 
increase, efforts are underway  to develop  an anti-aging  
 
drug or other geroprotective intervention that could 
extend healthspan, lower disease rates, and maintain 
productivity in this age group.   
 
Unfortunately, there are many roadblocks to such an 
intervention.  While many aging mechanisms are now 
catalogued [3] and hundreds of databased drugs extend 
lifespan in animal models [4,5], approval and testing of 
new drugs in humans is slow, expensive, and prone to

ABSTRACT 
 
Aging is now at the forefront of major challenges faced globally, creating an immediate need for safe, widescale
interventions to reduce the burden of chronic disease and extend human healthspan.  Metformin and
rapamycin are two FDA‐approved mTOR inhibitors proposed for this purpose, exhibiting significant anti‐cancer
and anti‐aging properties beyond their current clinical applications.  However, each faces issues with approval
for off‐label, prophylactic use due to adverse effects.  Here, we initiate an effort to identify nutraceuticals—
safer, naturally‐occurring compounds—that mimic the anti‐aging effects of metformin and rapamycin without
adverse effects. We applied several bioinformatic approaches and deep learning methods to the Library of
Integrated Network‐based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) dataset to map the gene‐ and pathway‐level signatures of
metformin and rapamycin and screen for matches among over 800 natural compounds. We then predicted the
safety of each compound with an ensemble of deep neural network classifiers. The analysis revealed many
novel candidate metformin and rapamycin mimetics, including allantoin and ginsenoside (metformin),
epigallocatechin gallate and isoliquiritigenin (rapamycin), and withaferin A (both).  Four relatively unexplored
compounds also scored well with rapamycin.  This work revealed promising candidates for future experimental
validation while demonstrating the applications of powerful screening methods for this and similar endeavors.

high failure rates.  This is particularly true in longevity 
research and exacerbated by a lack of reliable aging 
biomarkers [6,7] other than disease itself [6,8].  Even if 
successful, to be used preventatively, anti-aging drugs 
face extraordinarily high safety and efficacy standards 
for approval [9].    
 
One strategy to hasten the process has been the 
repurposing of existing, FDA-approved drugs that show 
off-label anti-cancer and anti-aging potential [10,11], 
and at the top of that list are metformin and rapamycin,  
two drugs that mimic caloric restriction [12].   
 
Caloric restriction is a well-known intervention for 
extending lifespan across species [13], but has limited 
practical value in humans [14]. Mimetics of caloric 
restriction would theoretically exert its beneficial effects 
without actual reduction in caloric intake.  Hallmarks of 
caloric restriction include reduced levels of circulating 
glucose and insulin as well as beneficial responses to 
these reductions in nutrient- and energy-sensing net-
works, such as activation of AMP-activated protein 
kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of mammalian target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) [15]. The mTOR pathway is a 
particularly important growth pathway essential for 
early development but also potentially detrimental in 
later years if not suppressed, contributing to gero-
conversion, cellular senescence, disease and decline 
[16].  Inhibition of the mTOR pathway slows conver-
sion to senescence [16] and extends longevity across 
species, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) 
[17], Caenorhabditis elegans (nematodes) [18,19], and 
Mus musculus (mice) [12,20–22].    
 
Rapamycin and metformin, while distinct in clinical 
use, are both mTOR inhibitors and exhibit multiple anti-
aging, anticancer, and anti-cardiovascular disease 
benefits  [23].   
 
Rapamycin (sirolimus) is an immunosuppressant used 
following renal transplantation, but also has life-
extending properties in multiple animal models, 
including yeast [24], Drosophila melanogaster (fruit 
flies) [25], and mice [26,27], though effects can be sex 
and genotype-dependent [28].  In renal transplant 
patients, rapamycin has been shown to reduce cancer 
risk post-surgery [29–34].  It also has significant anti-
cancer properties in mice [35–37]. While the extent to 
which its anticancer properties underlie its anti-aging 
effects and/or vice versa remains a point of discussion 
[15,38,39], as an anti-aging agent it has also been 
reported or theorized to protect against a number of 
other aging-related diseases in humans: cardio-vascular 
disease, osteoporosis, obesity, autoimmune disease and 
arthritis, macular degeneration, diabetes, Alzheimer’s 
disease, and Parkinson’s disease [16]. While rapamycin 
interacts 
with 
various 
nutrient 
signalling-related 
pathways, it acts primarily as an mTOR inhibitor, via 
direct inhibition of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) [23]. 
Analogs of rapamycin, or rapalogs (e.g. everolimus), 
are currently in use as anticancer drugs [40].  Also, 
mTORins, dual mTOR kinase inhibitors, are in 
development as anticancer agents, but much remains 
undetermined, such as proper dosage, toxicity, and 
adverse effects [15,38].   
 
Like rapamycin, metformin is also an mTOR inhibitor, 
although indirectly so and via multiple mechanisms 
[41–45].  Metformin is a biguanide most renowned as 
the first-line treatment for type II diabetes and meta-
bolic syndrome. It corrects hyperglycemia primarily by 
lowering hepatic gluconeogenesis but also by increasing 
insulin sensitivity and lowering levels of circulating 
lipids [9].  Its effects, however, appear to be pleiotropic, 
with benefits extending to a number of other age-related 
conditions in humans, including cancer [46,47] and  
cardiovascular disease [10]  
 
In animal models as well, multiple beneficial effects of 
metformin have been reported across species with 
varying anticancer and prolongevity effects, including 
AMPK-mediated improvements in cutaneous wound 
healing [48]. Results, however, depend on dosage, sex, 
and age at onset of treatment [49–53], factors relevant 
to widescale, prophylactic metformin use in humans 
[49,50].  
 
Metformin’s 
mechanisms of action have been 
extensively studied but are complex and remain only 
partially understood. Although metformin inhibits 
mTOR [43-45], its primary mode of action may be 
inhibition of mitochondrial complex I [54–62]. This 
action leads, among other things, to beneficial changes 
in cellular energy status and activation of AMPK 
[51,59, 62–66], a cellular energy sensor with a broad 
range of downstream effects on cellular function [67]. 
Through a combination of AMPK-dependent and -
independent mechanisms [68], metformin influences a 
number of signaling pathways, including IGF-1 [69], 
hepatic sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) [70–73] and mTOR complex 
1 (mTORC1) [74], that contribute directly or indirectly to 
its clinical response and multiple anticancer effects.   
 
Taken 
together, 
rapamycin 
and 
metformin 
are 
promising candidates for life and healthspan extension; 
however, concerns of adverse side effects have 
hampered their widescale adoption for this purpose.  
While short term rapamycin use is considered safe, it 
has been reported to be associated with more adverse 
events than cyclosporin A in renal transplant patients, 
including wound complications, mouth ulcers, diarrhea, 
hypokalemia, bronchopneumonia, and proteinuria and 
 www.aging‐us.com

AGING 
higher discontinuation rates (28.2% vs 14.9%) [75–77].  
In addition, chronic rapamycin use can lead to hepatic 
gluconeogenesis, insulin resistance, and severe glucose 
intolerance in rats [78], impaired glucose tolerance in 
mice [79], and even diabetes in male mice [80]. While 
rapamycin-induced diabetes is argued to differ from 
true type II diabetes [81], rapamycin may require 
pairing with metformin to counter induced hyper-
glycemia [40]. Metformin, while relatively safe, is 
poorly tolerated in one fourth to one half of patients due 
to gastrointestinal side effects [82], although prelimi-
nary findings suggest these can be alleviated in some 
with an extended-release form of the drug [83]. 
Metformin also carries a slight risk of lactic acidosis in 
certain individuals [84–86].  Interestingly, rapamycin 
lowers lactate production, so may buffer this risk [87].  
Metformin and rapamycin in combination may have 
additional benefits; in vitro they potentiate chemo-
therapy with mitotic inhibitors while protecting normal 
cells [41].  One suggestion has been varying dosage 
schedules and combinations of rapamycin with 
metformin and five other anti-aging compounds per 
individual to reduce side effects [40].  However, the 
best preventative, widescale intervention would be one 
for which risk is negligible.   
 
Given the urgency of the present need for anti-aging, 
disease preventive interventions, it may be beneficial to 
look to natural alternatives, such as nutraceuticals, that 
would be safe enough to administer widely with little to 
no risk of harm and with fewer regulatory hurdles than 
drugs.  Nutraceuticals have received considerable 
attention in recent years for potential roles in preventing 
or treating a number of age-related diseases [88]. 
 
In this work, we initiate an effort to identify safe, 
natural alternatives to metformin and rapamycin.  Our 
work is done entirely in silico and entails the use of 
metformin and rapamycin transcriptional and signaling 
pathway activation signatures to screen for matches 
amongst natural compounds.  We have shown previous-
ly that the transcriptional signature of a given drug 
response, disease state, or other physiological condition, 
when mapped to the signalome, can be useful for 
biomarker development [89–91] and drug screening 
[7,92,93]. 
Transcriptional 
signatures 
have 
been 
suggested by others as well for aiding in biomarker 
development [94], cancer drug screening [75] and 
repositioning [11], and diabetes management [95]. 
 
The 
transcriptional 
signature 
of 
metformin 
is 
particularly well-suited to this type of analysis, as it 
includes thousands of AMPK-dependent and AMPK-
independent changes in gene expression related to a 
diverse set of signaling pathways [96].  AMPK itself 
acts in part by directly and indirectly regulating 
metabolic gene expression when activated [97].  
Metformin’s transcriptional signature also shows 
considerable similarity to the gene expression signature 
of long term caloric restriction [98,99,49], which is 
thought to play a role in mediating its effects on lifespan 
[100,101].   
 
Gene expression data is in general a highly valuable 
resource that is still underutilized in drug discovery.  
With the public banking of data such as the LINCS 
project resulting in large repositories of cellular 
signatures of drug responses and disease states, large-
scale screening, signalome analysis, and deep learning 
can be employed at little cost to make new discoveries 
[102].  Yet due to the size, difficulty in cross-platform 
analysis, and high dimensionality of microarray 
datasets, much information remains unparsed.   
 
To overcome and even exploit these challenges, we 
have developed bioinformatic methods including 
Oncofinder [92,103], Geroscope [93], and in silico 
Pathway Activation Network Decomposition Analysis 
(iPANDA) [104], which extract robust, biologically 
relevant pathway activation signatures from the data by 
combining various elements of previous approaches.  
The iPANDA method in particular was recently shown 
to outperform other methods in cross-platform micro-
array analysis, noise and dimensionality reduction, and 
production of robust sets of biomarkers and reliable 
pathway signatures [93].  Illustratively, it was used 
successfully to identify biomarkers for breast cancer 
subtypes by stratifying samples by pathway activation 
[104], however it has many other potential applications, 
including drug discovery and drug mimicry, as we will 
demonstrate herein.  We are currently using iPANDA in 
several other applications, including mapping the 
transcriptional signature of senescence and screening 
for novel senolytics, drugs that would selectively 
eliminate senescent cells [8].  We have also previously 
developed deep learning methods involving training of 
deep neural networks (DNNs) to recognize trans-
criptional signatures and pathway activation signatures 
of drugs or disease states from microarray data or to 
predict adverse effects [93]. 
 
In the present study, we apply these methods to screen 
for nutraceuticals that mimic metformin and/or 
rapamycin. Using LINCS perturbation data, we reduce a 
list of over 800 natural compounds to a shortlist of 
candidate nutraceuticals that show both similarity to the 
target drugs and low adverse effects profiles [93].  We 
then discuss the top candidates in light of shared 
mechanisms and previously reported anticancer and 
other health benefits that may deem them particularly 
promising for future experimental validation.

RESULTS 
 
To screen for potential candidate nutraceuticals, we 
used gene expression data from the Library of 
Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) 
L1000 dataset to investigate similarity to metformin 
and/or rapamycin at the gene and pathway level (Figure 
1). We employed several complementary approaches, 
including conventional statistical methods, pathway 
scoring-based methods, and training of deep neural 
networks 
(DNN) 
for 
signature 
recognition.  
Additionally, to evaluate potential adverse effects of top-
scoring natural compounds we utilised a set of deep 
learned predictors, trained on drug-induced trans-
criptional response data. One important attribute of 
natural compounds we also looked closely at was GRAS 
(Generally Recognized As Safe) status and safety data.   
 
Selection of natural compounds for screening 
 
Prior to analysis, we filtered the LINCS dataset for 
compounds of natural origin by combining the 
compound lists from UNPD [105] and KEGG BRITE 
[106] databases and using the resulting list to select 
compounds in the LINCS dataset.  In total, this resulted 
in 871 natural compounds with transcriptional response 
data across various times, concentrations, and cell lines. 
We utilized all available gene expression profiles for 
each compound, including metformin and rapamycin.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Deep learning-based scoring of compounds at gene 
level 
 
For similarity scoring, we first used deep learning to 
train binary classifiers to recognize perturbations similar 
to metformin or rapamycin in transcriptional signature. 
A five fold cross-validation classifier for metformin and 
rapamycin achieved an F1-score of 0.725 and 0.905 and 
Matthews correlation of 0.705 and 0.896, respectively.  
Each sample corresponding to perturbation with a 
natural compound was run through each DNN classifier 
and assigned a probability. We used a threshold of 0.5 
to determine the significant hits and then performed a 
Fisher’s exact test to estimate the statistical significance 
for each compound (Figure 2, Supplementary Tables 1 
and 2).  
 
The compound exhibiting the highest similarity to 
metformin according to the metformin classifier (Fig. 
2A) was allantoin, a key beneficial compound in yam 
(Dioscorea spp.). Like metformin, allantoin is a 
guanidinium derivative with anti-hyperglycemic effects 
[107,108].  It is an important metabolic intermediate of 
purine metabolism in many species across Eukarya and 
Bacteria domains [109,110]. Being a guanidinium 
derivative, allantoin is similar to metformin in structure 
and has been shown to induce glucose lowering effects 
via  imidazoline I-2 receptors  [107,108].  Other top  hits

and KEGG BRITE databases. Perturbations with those compounds in cancer cell lines were compared with perturbations with
metformin and rapamycin to estimate similarity at the gene and pathway level and deep learning techniques were employed to
recognize the transcriptional signature of metformin and rapamycin and screen for matches amongst the LINCS compounds.

for metformin included glucosamine, a compound used 
in the treatment of osteoarthritis [111,112], and car-
damonin, a member of the anti-inflammatory chalcones 
found in plant-based foods [113], which inhibits mTOR 
and exhibits antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo [114].   
 
With the rapamycin classifier, the most significant hit 
was geldanamycin (Fig. 2B). Geldanamycin  is  an  anti- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
biotic belonging to Ansamycins family and targets the 
ADP/ATP binding site of heat shock protein 90 
(Hsp90). Similarly to rapamycin, it has been shown to 
suppress the mTOR pathway through inhibition of the 
interaction between Hsp90 and RAPTOR [115]. 
Interestingly, the second most significant hit was 
withaferin A, which aligned with our subsequent results

rapamycin, 
respectively. 
Other 
compounds 
with 
significant similarity to rapamycin according to the 
DNN classifier included another Hsp90 inhibitor, 
radicicol, several members of the anthracyclines 
antibiotic family used in cancer treatment  (dauno-
rubicin, idarubicin, doxorubicin, epirubicin) [116], 
cerulenin, a fatty acid synthase inhibitor with potential 
anticancer effects [117], chaetocin, being investigated 
as 
a 
histone 
lysine 
methyltransferase 
inhibitor 
[118,119], phloretin, an anti-tumor agent found in plant-
based foods that shows effectiveness in inducing 
apoptosis in human lung cancer cells [120] and 
staurosporine, which also exhibited metformin simila-
rity in subsequent results. The highest odds ratios were 
observed with four relatively unexplored compounds 
(BRD-A35769934, BRD-K85565420, BRD-A15501135, 
BRD-A37501891).  Notably, 24 of 24 profiled samples 
for each of these compounds reached statistical sig-
nificance.  
 
Similarity at gene and pathway level 
 
We next determined gene-level similarity of each 
compound 
to 
metformin 
and 
rapamycin 
using 
conventional statistical methods.  First, this involved 
comparing each distinct time- and concentration-
specific compound perturbation measured across 
various cell lines to corresponding DMSO-treated 
reference samples. We performed differential gene 
expression 
analysis 
to 
determine 
statistically 
significantly perturbed genes. Then, to screen for 
compounds with high similarity to metformin or 
rapamycin in terms of individual gene expression 
changes, we used Fisher’s Exact Test to directly 
compare all metformin or rapamycin perturbations to 
individual perturbations of other natural compounds 
(Supplementary Table 3).   
 
To determine pathway-level similarity, we applied the 
iPANDA algorithm [104] to acquire pathway activation 
profiles for the same set of individual perturbations.  
For each compound, perturbation pathway activation 
scores (PAS) were calculated for 378 pathways.  
Similarity of pathway activation signatures of natural 
compounds to metformin and rapamycin was evaluated 
by the number of commonly up- and down-regulated 
pathways (Supplementary Table 4).  
 
Combined results of gene- and pathway-level analysis 
are depicted in Figure 3. Gene-level analysis of 
similarity to metformin (Fig. 3A) showed that the most 
significant perturbation was associated with withaferin-
A, a steroidal lactone that exhibits antidiabetic and 
anticancer properties [121]  Pathway-level scoring, on 
the other hand, demonstrated ginsenoside Rc, a 
compound isolated from ginseng, to be the top hit.  
Other compounds at the top of the list for significant 
gene- and pathway-level similarity to metformin 
included umbelliferone, a coumarin with antihyper-
glycemic, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor properties 
[122], coumaric acid, the p- isomer of which shows 
immunosuppressive, 
anti-inflammatory, 
and 
anti-
diabetic properties [123,124], staurosporine, a kinase 
inhibitor with promising antitumor properties but poor 
selectivity [123–125], bile acids, which have been 
shown to have anti-cancer properties and specifically 
anti-hypoxic tumor effects [126], and ellipticine, a 
plant-derived compound with significant anticancer 
effects but issues with toxicity [127].   
 
For rapamycin (Fig. 3B), the most significant hits at the 
gene level were epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a 
compound underlying the aging-related benefits of 
green 
tea, 
including 
protection 
against 
cancer, 
cardiovascular events, and UV-mediated skin aging 
[128], sphingosine, the precursor to sphingosine 1-
phosphate, a second messenger implicated in several 
diseases, including multiple sclerosis, sepsis, cancer, 
and cardiovascular disease [129], and isoliquiritigenin, a 
compound shown to act as an anticancer, anti-cardio-
vascular disease, antioxidant, antimicrobial, hepato-
protective, and immunoprotective agent [130].   A num-
ber of other compounds were highly similar to 
rapamycin at the pathway level.  These included 
strophanthidin, a compound recently identified in a 
similar LINCS screening as being likely to reverse 
cancer-related gene expression, which was validated in 
the liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) cell line [75], 
cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressant alternative to 
rapamycin following transplantation [75,76] cyclo-
heximide, a highly toxic protein synthesis inhibitor used 
primarily in basic research, including cancer research 
[131], ochratoxin A, a potentially carcinogenic myco-
toxin found and regulated in a wide variety of foods 
[111], and, notably due to its gene-level similarity to 
metformin above, withaferin A.   
 
Effective combinations of natural compounds 
 
Often, natural remedies with proven effectiveness 
consist of one or several plant species which can 
account for hundreds of natural compounds [132]. 
Accumulating evidence suggests that a combination of 
several compounds targeting multiple pathologic 
signaling circuits might be more advantageous than 
single agent treatments [133–137].  Examples of syner-
gistic anti-aging effects of drug combinations with 
different targets have been reported [37,138]. This is 
particularly relevant to natural compounds with GRAS 
status, since the likelihood of serious adverse reactions 
is low.

For these reasons, we also estimated the similarity of 
different combinations of natural compounds to 
metformin. This required us to predict the trans-
criptional response after perturbation with a given 
combination of compounds. We chose to  do this on  the  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pathway level  and  to  calculate  the  combinatorial  res- 
ponse as the sum of individual PAS values cor-
responding to individual perturbations. We fully 
considered that additive effects on a pathway may be 
limited and other types of effects (e.g. synergistic,  com-

petitive, etc.) may be at play.  Our rationale for 
assuming additivity was required for simplification, but 
we tested the additivity assumption for its predictive 
value with an external dataset and the results supported 
the approach.   We used external dataset E-MEXP-3192 
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress 
Supplementary 
Figure 1) [139], where the pathway activation signature 
of two compounds, retinoic acid and lapatinib, was 
explored, both individually and in combination, to 
predict their combinatorial drug effects by taking the 
sum of individual PAS values. Results, at least in the 
case of these two compounds, showed high similarity 
between the predicted and actual combinatorial pathway 
activation signatures, supporting the use of PAS 
additivity in this context (Supplementary Figure 1). 
 
To investigate whether any of the natural compound 
combinations would produce better similarity scores 
than each compound independently, we selected four 
compounds with known beneficial effects and good 
safety profiles: withaferin-A, ginsenoside, apigenin and 
gamma linolenic acid (GLA).  
 
We used our previously established database of aging-
associated pathways and calculated PAS values for each 
compound (Supplementary Table 5). Then we devised all 
possible combinations of these compounds and estimated 
the resulting pathway activation as the sum of PAS 
values 
of 
individual 
compounds. 
Each 
of 
the 
combinations was compared to the profile of metformin 
and Pearson correlation coefficient was used as a 
similarity metric (Supplementary Table 6). Combina-
tions outperformed the individual compounds, with 
similarity of the top 10 combinations ranging from 0.73-
0.80 (Supplementary Table 6).  As an example, we 
selected a combination of three nutraceuticals with high 
similarity to metformin, good safety profiles, and/or 
previously reported anti-aging, anticancer, or anti-disease 
potential:  ginsenoside, GLA, and withaferin A.  Overall 
pathway level similarity between metformin and the top 
combination of nutraceuticals is depicted in Sup-
plementary Figure 2. Pathways with shared activation 
between metformin and the combination of these three 
compounds and each compound individually are shown 
in Supplementary Figure 2; the most significant of these 
were upregulation of JNK, cAMP, AKT, MAPK, ERK, 
and ILK pathways and down-regulation of ubiquitin 
proteosome signaling. To investigate whether similarity 
varied among met-activated, met-neutral, and met-
inhibited pathways, we also examined correlations 
between metformin and the nutraceuticals and nutra-
ceutical combination among these groups, with a 
designated threshold of 1 or -1 to define met-activated or 
met-inhibited pathways, respectively; results showed the 
strongest correlations with pathways inhibited by 
metformin (Supplementary Table 7).   
Deep learning-predicted adverse effects 
 
Additionally, to estimate the safety of investigated 
natural compounds we utilized our deep learned adverse 
effects prediction approach [93]. For every sample 
corresponding to perturbation with a natural compound, 
we ran an ensemble of 305 predictors each correspond-
ing to a particular side effect category. Resulting 
probabilities were averaged for each side effect of each 
natural compound. Then, to estimate the overall adverse 
effects prediction of a compound, we calculated mean 
probability across all adverse effects and the number of 
adverse effects with probability >0.5 (Supplementary 
Table 8).  
 
Interestingly, rapamycin was near the top of the list of 
compounds with the highest probability of adverse 
effects, with a maximum mean probability of 0.41 
across all potential adverse effects and 134 total effects 
categories for which probability exceeded 0.5.  Of 
these, the top ten adverse effects categories included 
cardiac and vascular, lipid, testicular and epididymal, 
skin, 
general, 
immunodeficiency, 
obstetric 
and 
gynecological, eye, neurological, and vascular/hyper- 
tensive, all with probabilities >0.9.  Metabolic (0.86) 
and glucose/ diabetic (0.75) effects probabilities were 
also high for rapamycin.  Other compounds with high 
mean adverse effects probabilities included anthra-
cycline 
antibiotics, 
oligomycin-c, 
tacrolimus, 
paroxetine, benzethonium, wortmannin and triptolide. 
The safest compounds, on the other hand, with <3 
significant adverse effects categories and mean overall 
probabilities <0.05, turned out to be the compounds 
with highest odds ratios for rapamycin similarity 
scoring (BRD-A35769934, BRD-K85565420, BRD-
A15501135, BRD-A37501891) as well as tert-
butylhydroquinone, lanatoside-c, syringic acid, morin, 
niacin and gossypetin (mean probabilities <0.10, 11 or 
fewer 
significant 
adverse 
effects 
categories).  
Metformin was predicted to have relatively few adverse 
effects, as well, with mean probability 0.2 and 25 
significant adverse effects categories. 
 
We then searched the adverse effects table against the list 
of candidate compounds selected above for metformin 
and rapamycin similarity to investigate predicted adverse 
effects.  For metformin-like compounds, we found the 
following mean adverse effects probabilities and number 
of adverse effects categories:  withaferin A (0.14, 52), 
staurosporine (0.17, 126), ginsenoside (0.25, 29), 
umbelliferone (0.24, 19), ellipticine (0.17, 69), allantoin 
(0.14, 28), glucosamine (0.25, 58), cardamonin (0.26, 
66).  For rapamycin-like compounds, we found similar 
probabilities and numbers of categories:  ECGC (0.25, 
31), sphingosine (0.20, 46), isoliquiritigenin (0.23, 88), 
strophanthidin (0.17, 38), cyclosporin A (0.26, 62),

ochratoxin A (0.19, 39), geldanamycin (0.20, 57), 
radicicol (0.20, 87), cerulenin (0.22, 49), and chaetocin 
(0.09, 23).  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
In this work, we introduce a rapid, low-cost route to 
drug mimicry via screening public gene expression 
datasets for compounds with shared transcriptional and 
signaling pathway activation signatures.  The methods 
we employ [104] combine and outperform previous 
methods for pathway activation scoring and capitalize 
on vast, valuable but underutilized public repositories of 
microarray data, overcoming significant analytical 
challenges that have previously hindered their wide-
scale use.  
 
In an application of these methods, we focused on 
mimicry of 
metformin and rapamycin, seeking 
nutraceuticals that could preserve their anti-aging and 
disease-preventive potential while being better suited 
for wide-scale prophylactic use.  
  
One of the most significant findings was withaferin A, 
one of only two only compounds topping the list for 
similarity to both metformin and rapamycin.  Withaferin 
A was the top-scoring compound for gene-level 
similarity to 
metformin using the conventional 
statistical approach and also displayed significant 
pathway- and gene-level similarity to rapamycin using 
both the pathway activation approach and the deep 
learning approach. Withaferin A is a steroidal lactone 
derived from members of the Solanaceae family (e.g. 
Acnistus 
arborescens 
and 
Withania 
somnifera), 
commonly used in Ayurveda (traditional Indian 
medicine) for arthritis and menstrual disorders.  
Mounting evidence in rodent and cell-culture models 
indicate that it is an anti-diabetic, anti-obesity and anti-
cancer 
agent 
with 
potent 
anti-oxidative, 
anti-
inflammatory, anti-proliferative, apoptosis-inducing and 
leptin-sensitizing properties [121]. 
 
Mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) have seen 20-
25% reductions in body weight as a result of withaferin 
A treatment [140], as well as a decrease in obesity-
associated pathology, e.g. hepatic steatosis. Withaferin 
A also has beneficial effects on glucose metabolism that 
are independent of its leptin-sensitizing effect.  
 
Many of its anticancer properties result from its ability 
to inhibit cell proliferation and decrease glucose 
utilization, glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) 
cycle intermediates [141]. Additionally, it has been 
found to be a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. It inhibits 
cell proliferation via inhibition of cyclin D1 expression, 
as well as inhibition of NF-kappa B, which is thought to 
occur via interference with the ubiquitin-mediated 
proteasome pathway [142], as suggested by increased 
levels of polyubiquitinated proteins in cancer cells 
following treatment with withaferin A. It has also been 
found to selectively induce cell death in multiple types 
of tumor cells [143,144]. Its anticancer effects are 
mediated through modulation of a number of pathways, 
including inhibition of Notch 1 [145], inhibition of 
STAT3 activation [146–148], downregulation of the 
MTOR signalling components pS6K and p4E-BP1 
[145], downregulation of the prosurvival pathway 
Akt/NF-kappaB/Bcl-2 [145], induction of c-Jun-NH(2)-
kinase-mediated apoptosis [145], induction of apoptosis 
via upregulation of Bim, t-Bid, caspase-8, and DR5 
[149], suppression of constitutive and IL-6-induced 
phosphorylation of STAT3 (on Tyr705) and consequent 
down-regulation of the STAT3 regulated genes Bcl-xL, 
Bcl-2, cyclin D1 and survivin [150], inhibition of heat 
shock protein 90 [151], downregulation of COX-2 and 
iNOS by blocking NF-κB activity [121], and down-
regulation of TNF-a [152]. 
 
Withaferin A was one of three compounds we included 
in the combination explored for metformin similarity. 
The other two were ginsenoside and GLA, which also 
demonstrate anti-aging, anticancer, and anti-disease 
potential in a number of studies.   
 
Ginsenoside was the most similar compound to 
metformin at the pathway level.  Used in traditional 
Chinese medicine, ginsenosides comprise a group of 
over 150 naturally occurring compounds isolated from 
plants of the Panax species (ginseng) [153]. Although 
the family is relatively diverse in term of chemical 
structure, most of its members share similar properties. 
A wide variety of benefits have been reported [153],  
including 
anticarcinogenic 
[154–157], 
immuno-
modulatory [157–161], anti‐inflammatory [162], anti-
allergic [163–165], antiatherosclerotic [166], anti-
hypertensive [167,168], antidiabetic [169], anxiolytic 
[170,171] and antidepressant effects [172].  Ginseno-
sides activate AMPK [154,156,169,173] PI3K [169] 
and SirtI [169,174] pathways, promoting autophagy 
[154–156] and apoptosis [154–156] in cancer cells. 
 
Another clear standout for metformin similarity was 
revealed by the DNN classifier, and that was allantoin, 
one of the active compounds mediating beneficial 
effects of yam.  Yam powder, yam extract, and allantoin 
have been shown to improve B-cell function in 
maintaining insulin and glucose in a rat model of Type 
II diabetes, with antioxidative effects as well, improved 
lipid profiles, and increased release of glucagon-like 
peptide 1 (GLP1) [175].  In another study using the 
same rat model of diabetes, allantoin lowered plasma 
 www.aging‐us.com 
2254 
AGING 
glucose levels by increasing ß-endorphin secretion, 
increasing GLUT4 expression, and increasing glucose 
uptake [108,176,177]. 
 
Overall, the most remarkable aspect of the metformin 
results was that, like metformin, several of the 
compounds scoring high in similarity exhibit glucose-
lowering properties (withaferin A [121], umbelliferone 
[122], and allantoin [107,108]) or anti-inflammatory 
effects (glucosamine [111,112] and cardamonin  
[113]) in previous studies, and almost all of the top 
hits have shown anticancer potential, including 
withaferin A [141–144], ginsenoside [154–157], 
umbelliferone [122], staurosporine [123–125], bile 
acids [126], ellipticine  [127], cardamonin [113], and 
allantoin [177].  This not only lends preliminary 
support to the validity of our methods, but also adds 
support to the evidence of metformin-like health 
benefits with these compounds. 
 
Scoring for rapamycin overall revealed a larger number 
of significant hits compared to metformin, but more 
variation in the range of known effects, from beneficial 
to highly toxic.  These also included several unnamed, 
novel candidates.  Four of these relatively unexplored 
compounds 
(BRD-A35769934, 
BRD-K85565420, 
BRD-A15501135, BRD-A37501891) were the most 
significant in similarity to rapamycin and were also top-
ranking in terms of safety, with extremely low 
probability of predicted adverse effects.  These would 
be excellent novel candidates for characterization and 
validation in future work. 
 
Like the metformin DNN classifier, the rapamycin 
classifier also revealed a clear standout amongst the 
compounds for rapamycin similarity, geldanamycin.  
Geldanamycin is an inhibitor of Hsp90 [178], which is 
an oncogenic target molecule overexpressed in many 
tumors [115,179]. Geldanamcyin is an inhibitor of 
mTOR signaling as well [115]  While initially 
promising as an potent anticancer agent [115,179,180], 
its hepatotoxicity has precluded its clinical use 
[180,181]; however, several less toxic derivatives have 
been developed [182], with 17AEP-GA and 17DMAG 
recently demonstrating growth suppression of multiple 
myeloma cells similar to geldanamycin  [181]. 
Geldanamycin analog development is still an active area 
of research [182–185], with other analogs being 
recently shown to be effective against breast cancer 
cells [182,185].  In addition to geldanamycin, at least 
two of the other rapamycin hits in this study, radicicol 
and EGCG are also Hsp90 inhibitors [183,184].  
Recently, a radicicol derivative, NW457, was shown to 
be effective against colorectal cancer both in vitro and 
in vivo [186].   
Many of the other top hits for rapamycin show 
anticancer effects, including anthracyclines [116], 
cerulenin [117], isoliquiritigenin [130], strophanthidin 
[75], ECGC [128], phloretin [120], staurosporine [123–
125], and withaferin A [141–144].  Several of the 
rapamycin-like compounds identified are known to 
modulate mTOR signaling.  These include geldana-
mycin, which suppresses mTOR phosphorylation of 
downstream protein regulators [115], phloretin, a 
common flavonoid capable of inducing cell cycle arrest 
and  apoptosis  in  part  via  suppression  of  AKT/PI3K/ 
mTOR cascades [187], and isoliquiritigenin, another 
flavonoid that induces autophagic and apoptotic cell 
death in cancer cells via mTOR signaling [188].  Thus, 
like metformin, many of the compounds identified as 
being similar to rapamycin in transcriptional signature 
have been previously shown to have rapamycin-like 
properties.  Other rapamycin-like compounds identified 
have mTOR-independent mechanisms, such as chae-
tocin, a histone H3K9 methyltransferase inhibitor [119].   
 
Finally, rapamycin had a remarkably high number of 
predicted adverse effects with our methods and 
significant similarity to at least two compounds known 
to be toxic, ochratoxin A and cycloheximide, although 
these toxic compounds were not predicted to have a 
wide variety of adverse effects (cycloheximide did 
score particularly high (0.86) in the toxicity category, 
however, as did strophanthidin (0.93)).  This under-
scores the need to look for rapamycin alternatives, and 
also raises interesting questions about the common (and 
distinct) mechanisms between rapamycin and the wide 
variety of rapamycin-like compounds, both beneficial 
and toxic. 
 
The adverse effects prediction also enabled us to have a 
closer look at overall predicted safety of compounds of 
interest and likelihoods of specific adverse effects.  
None of the compounds discussed as similar to 
metformin or rapamycin stood out as extremely likely 
or unlikely to cause a wide variety of adverse effects; 
most scored in the low-moderate range, although this 
does not fully reflect the severity or importance of any 
one given adverse effects category for a given 
compound.  Literature-based assessments of safety were 
also helpful; while several compounds are known to be 
toxic as noted, others are known to be relatively safe 
compounds found in plant-based foods, such as 
cardamonin and ECGC, or used in traditional medicine, 
such as withaferin A and ginsenosides.  Safety in a 
preventative, chronic use context for each compound 
would have to be independently evaluated.  Also, while 
there were no standout metformin-like candidates with 
an absence of gastrointestinal adverse effects, there 
were several rapamycin-like candidates with low 
likelihood 
of 
glucose/metabolic 
adverse 
effects, 
 www.aging‐us.com 
2255 
AGING 
including withaferin A and ECGC. Perhaps the most 
notable compounds were the four unnamed compounds 
with similarity to rapamycin; their novelty, extremely 
low number of predicted adverse effects, including 
glucose/metabolic effects, and extremely high odds 
ratios for rapamycin similarity make them particularly 
intriguing candidates.  
 
The in silico approach, while time- and cost-saving, 
does require several considerations in light of its role as 
a first-pass screening tool.  First, and most importantly, 
the health-extending and adverse effects of all candidate 
nutraceuticals or other compounds will still require 
investigation and validation in vitro and in other cell 
lines, followed by validation in vivo in humans. This is 
particularly important in the case of nutraceuticals, as 
wide variation in their bioavailability and metabolism is 
a significant factor influencing the degree to which the 
predicted effects actually manifest in vivo [189].  
Secondly, our approach hinges entirely upon the 
biological relevance of the short term (<48 hours) 
transcription-level response to a drug, and as such does 
not 
account 
for 
post-transcriptional 
and 
post-
translational effects on a given pathway or long term 
changes, which may be biologically or clinically more 
important [190].  That said, numerous studies have 
demonstrated the value in using such expression 
signatures in the characterization of drug response [191]. 
 
Thus, while it cannot be overstated that our results will 
require validation, this work reduces a list of over 800 
natural compounds to a manageable shortlist of a few 
strong candidates for metformin and rapamycin 
mimicry, substantiated by their similarity to the target 
drugs in transcriptional response.  Several of these 
compounds are unnamed, novel candidates.  Many of 
the others have known anticancer or other beneficial 
effects and now are demonstrated to share common 
cellular signatures with two known anticancer, anti-
aging drugs, thus supporting previous findings and 
further investigation into their potential benefits.  That 
so many compounds with anticancer and other health 
benefits share common transcriptional signatures raises 
interesting questions about what pathways are shared 
and distinct and which shared pathways are most critical 
to their beneficial effects.  This has not only direct 
practical value in a narrow sense with the search for 
metformin and rapamycin mimetics, but has broader 
usefulness for any number of applications in drug 
discovery.  If widely adopted, our approaches  have the 
potential to significantly expedite drug development 
timelines, reducing cost by offering a viable and 
biologically-relevant means of screening and ranking 
compounds prior to in vitro studies and, since screening 
is based on human data, possibly in place of animal 
models. Improving our ability to predict the actions of a 
nutraceutical or drug in humans will give in silico-based 
approaches enormous utility in streamlining drug 
discovery, repurposing and development in the years to 
come. 
 
METHODS 
 
Transcriptomic data 
 
To obtain transcriptomic and signaling pathway 
activation 
signatures, 
we 
utilized 
transcriptional 
response 
data 
provided 
by 
LINCS 
Project 
(http://www.lincsproject.org/). To obtain a list of 
natural compounds present in the LINCS data set we 
used the UNPD database of natural compounds [105] in 
combination with 3 compound classification categories 
derived 
from 
KEGG 
BRITE 
Database 
[106]: 
“Phytochemical compounds”, “Phytochemicals used as 
drugs” and “Natural toxins”. The natural compound list 
was then compared to the list from the LINCS data set 
and 871 compounds were identified.  
 
For each of these compounds, we extracted the level 3 
(Q2NORM) gene expression data for each available cell 
line perturbed with each concentration of compound 
independently for all available timepoints. In the 
pathway-level analysis, for each case sample group 
perturbed with a compound, we generated a reference 
group consisting of samples perturbed with DMSO that 
came from the same RNA plate as samples from the 
case group. We analysed transcriptional response to 
perturbation with metformin, rapamycin, and a number of 
nutraceuticals as assayed in various cancer cell lines.   
 
Differential expression 
 
For transcriptome data, a limma test of differential gene 
expression was used. Each set of differentially 
expressed genes was ordered according to the following 
measure, which takes into account both the magnitude 
and statistical significance of the effect: FC * max(0, -
log(p-value)), where FC is fold-change of gene 
expression between groups and p-value represents the 
result of limma test. 
 
Gene level similarity to metformin/rapamycin 
 
A statistically motivated score estimating the similarity 
of a compound was designed. Significantly up- or 
down-regulated genes were defined as those with an 
FDR-adjusted p-value of <0.01. A Fisher’s exact test 
was used to measure the association between two 
characteristics of each gene: being significantly down-
regulated following metformin/rapamycin treatment and 
being significantly downregulated following treatment 
with each investigated compound in our compound 
 www.aging‐us.com 
2256 
AGING 
library. The same test was performed for upregulated 
genes. The best of p-values of those two tests were 
taken as a score for the given drug or compound. A 
multiple testing correction of the obtained p-values for 
the amount of compound perturbations under study was 
performed. 
 
Pathway-level similarity analysis 
 
Pathway activation analysis is a powerful tool for 
extracting biologically-relevant properties from large 
transcriptomic datasets, enabling the generation of 
novel results prior to or in place of  in vitro and in vivo 
experimentation. We have recently reported on a novel 
deep learning-based algorithm, the in silico Pathway 
Activation 
Network 
Decomposition 
Analysis 
(iPANDA), which we applied to large-scale trans-crip-
tomic datasets as a tool for biomarker identification 
[104]. In contrast to other methods of pathway 
activation 
analysis, 
iPANDA 
generates 
pathway 
activation scores (PAS) by using  precalculated gene 
coexpression data in combination with gene importance 
factors quantified according to the degree of differential 
gene expression and pathway topology decomposition. 
Here, we applied the same general approach to the task of 
drug mimicry, ranking existing nutraceutical compounds 
and 
compound 
combinations 
according 
to 
their 
transcriptomic signature’s degree of similarity to the 
known transcriptomic signature of metformin and 
rapamycin. 
 
For pathway-level similarity analysis we chose gene 
expression samples of drug induced transcriptional 
response from A549 cell line. Signaling pathway 
activation scores for 378 total pathways from 
SABiosciences collection (http://www.sabiosciences. 
com/pathwaycentral.php) were calculated for each 
perturbation of 871 natural compounds, including 
Metformin and Rapamycin, using iPANDA algorithm 
[104]. Similarity of two perturbations was measured as  
percent of commonly up- or down-regulated pathways 
between them. 
 
Combination 
scoring. 
Additivity 
hypothesis 
was 
checked on the dataset E-MEXP-3192 (http://www.ebi. 
ac.uk/arrayexpress). Preprocessed gene expression data 
corresponding to samples that underwent 12 hour 
treatment with 100nm retinoic acid, 100 nm lapatinib 
and their combination was analysed with iPANDA 
algorithm. For several selected compounds pathway 
analysis was done for 97 age-related pathways [93]. 
PAS values for withaferin-A, ginsenoside, apigenin and 
GLA were measured in PC3 cells perturbed for 24 
hours with 10μM  of the compound with the exception 
of To estimate the combinatorial effect of 5 selected 
natural compounds with GRAS status PAS scores were 
summed for each combination of two or more 
compounds. Then we used Pearson correlation coef-
ficient between metformin and the combination to 
estimate the similarity. 
 
Deep learning prediction of metformin/rapamycin 
signature and adverse effects 
 
Deep neural networks (DNNs) were trained with 
transcriptional response data from the LINCS L1000 
dataset. All available perturbations from MCF7, PC3, 
VCAP, A549, A375 and HT29 cell lines related to 
Metformin (perturbation id: BRD-K79602928) and 
Rapamycin (perturbation ids: BRD-A23770159, BRD-
A50287119, 
BRD-A79768653, 
BRD-K84937637, 
BRD-K89626439, BRD-K99369265) were indepen-
dently used and contributed to two training sets. 
Training and test sets were split at 80/20 ratio. For the 
Metformin prediction we used 67309 samples as the 
training set (98 samples are labeled as positive class) 
and 15788 samples as the test set (24 samples are 
labeled as positive class). For the Rapamycin prediction 
we used 68421 samples as the training set (517 samples 
are labeled as positive class) and 14677 samples as the 
test set (114 samples are labeled as positive class).  The 
DNN was built by adjusting its hyperparameters (e.g. 
number of layers, activation function, etc.) on the 
training set and subsequently measuring the perfor-
mance of the trained neural network on the test set. All 
experiments were conducted using an NVIDIA Titan X. 
 
We used multilayer feed-forward neural networks as 
deep models (i.e. having more than 3 layers). 
Gridsearch algorithm was used for multiple hyper-
parameters optimization in order to achieve the greatest 
predictive accuracy. We minimized the binary cross 
entropy 
loss 
function 
using 
a 
backpropagation 
algorithm. We used the Leaky ReLU activation function 
[192] in each layer, ADAM as optimizer of the cost 
function [193], dropout with 25% probability after each 
layer for the purposes of regularization [194] and 
additional L1 penalty on layer parameters. 
 
Adverse effects for drugs were derived from SIDER 
database [83]. Side effect categories were mapped onto 
321 preferred term from MedDRA v16.0 ontology [84]. 
An ensemble of class-specific DNNs with binary output 
was trained in a similar way to the methodology describ-
ed previously [85]. All probabilities related to in a single 
side effect and perturbation id of the drug were 
aggregated.

Supplementary Figure 2. Shared pathway activation between metformin and selected compound combination.  Selected
compounds for mimicking metformin included ginsenoside, gamma‐linolenic acid, and withaferin‐A. Here, metformin‐
activated or ‐inhibited aging pathways were selected, dependent on a metformin pathway activation strength (PAS)
threshold of +/‐1 and shared directionality of PAS for all three nutraceutical compounds comprising the selected
combination. Predicted combination PAS for each pathway was defined as the sum of PAS for the individual nutraceuticals.
