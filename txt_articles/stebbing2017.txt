Summary
Background CT-P6 is a proposed biosimilar to reference trastuzumab. In this study, we aimed to establish equivalence 
of CT-P6 to reference trastuzumab in neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer.
Methods In this randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, phase 3 equivalence trial, we recruited women aged 
18 years or older with stage I–IIIa operable HER2-positive breast cancer from 112 centres in 23 countries. Inclusion 
criteria were an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1; a normal left ventricular 
ejection fraction of at least 55%; adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function; at least one measureable lesion; 
and known oestrogen and progesterone receptor status. Exclusion criteria included bilateral breast cancer, previous 
breast cancer treatment, previous anthracycline treatment, and pregnancy or lactation. We randomly allocated 
patients 1:1 to receive neoadjuvant CT-P6 or reference trastuzumab intravenously (eight cycles, each lasting 3 weeks, 
for 24 weeks; 8 mg/kg on day 1 of cycle 1 and 6 mg/kg on day 1 of cycles 2–8) in conjunction with neoadjuvant 
docetaxel (75 mg/m² on day 1 of cycles 1–4) and FEC (fluorouracil [500 mg/m²], epirubicin [75 mg/m²], and 
cyclophosphamide [500 mg/m²]; day 1 of cycles 5–8) therapy. We stratified randomisation by clinical stage, receptor 
status, and country and used permuted blocks. We did surgery within 3–6 weeks of the final neoadjuvant study drug 
dose, followed by an adjuvant treatment period of up to 1 year. We monitored long-term safety and efficacy for 3 years 
after the last patient was enrolled. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment until study completion. 
The primary efficacy endpoint, analysed in the per-protocol population, was pathological complete response, assessed 
via specimens obtained during surgery, analysed by masked central review of local histopathology reports. The 
equivalence margin was –0·15 to 0·15. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02162667, and is 
ongoing, but no longer recruiting.
Findings Between Aug 7, 2014, and May 6, 2016, we randomly allocated 549 patients (271 [49%] to CT-P6 vs 278 [51%] 
to reference trastuzumab). A similar proportion of patients achieved pathological complete response with CT-P6 
(116 [46·8%; 95% CI 40·4–53·2] of 248 patients) and reference trastuzumab (129 [50·4%; 44·1–56·7] of 256 patients). 
The 95% CI of the estimated treatment outcome difference (–0·04% [95% CI –0·12 to 0·05]) was within the 
equivalence margin. 19 (7%) of 271 patients in the CT-P6 group reported serious treatment-emergent adverse events 
versus 22 (8%) of 278 in the reference trastuzumab group; frequent (occurring in more than one patient) serious 
adverse events were febrile neutropenia (four [1%] vs one [<1%]) and neutropenia (one [<1%] vs two [1%]). Grade 3 or 
worse treatment-related adverse events occurred in 17 (6%) of 271 patients in the CT-P6 group versus 23 (8%) of 278 
in the reference trastuzumab group; the most frequently reported adverse event was neutropenia in ten (4%) versus 
14 (5%). 
Interpretation CT-P6 showed equivalent efficacy to reference trastuzumab and adverse events were similar. Availability 
of trastuzumab biosimilars could increase access to this targeted therapy for HER2-positive early-stage cancer.

Introduction
Approximately 25% of invasive breast cancers amplify the 
HER2 oncogene, resulting in constitutive activation of 
the type I transmembrane HER2 protein.1–3 Development 
of trastuzumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody that 
binds to the extracellular domain of HER2, was a 
major advance in treatment of HER2-overexpressing 
(HER2-positive) cancers. The first clinical trial4,5 of 
trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting was discontinued 
prematurely when addition of the antibody to chemo-
therapy doubled the proportion of patients achieving a 
pathological complete response (pCR) com 
pared with 
chemotherapy alone in patients with HER2-positive, 
early-stage, operable breast cancer. Sub 
sequent studies6,7 
have substantiated the efficacy of trastuzumab with 
respect to increasing pCR and shown that pCR is 
associated with favourable long-term survival outcomes.8

US (American Society of Clinical Oncology)10 guidelines 
now recommend chemotherapy plus trastuzumab for 
neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive forms of early-
stage breast, metastatic breast, and metastatic gastric 
cancer. However, the high costs associated with 
trastuzumab place a burden on health-care systems and 
limit global access to the drug.11,12
These cost-related barriers can be addressed, at least in 
part, by introduction of new biosimilars. A biosimilar 
drug is a biological product that is highly similar to an 
already approved drug, known as the reference product 
or originator, and which shows “no clinically meaningful 
differences [to the reference product] in terms of the 
safety, purity and potency”.13 Biosimilars are usually 
cheaper than their reference products14 and thus have the 
potential to broaden access to key drugs. Comprehensive 
testing is required to show the absence of clinically 
meaningful differences in safety, efficacy, and purity 
between a biosimilar and its reference product.13,15,16
CT-P6 is a proposed biosimilar to originator trastu-
zumab (reference trastuzumab). In-vitro studies have 
shown CT-P6 to be similar to the US-licensed reference 
trastuzumab in terms of HER2-binding affinity, antibody-
dependent cell-mediated toxicity, and antiproliferative 
activity, and preclinical in-vivo studies have shown that 
CT-P6 also has a similar toxicological profile to reference 
trastuzumab (Celltrion Inc, unpublished). A phase 1 
trial17 in healthy volunteers showed pharmacokinetic 
(PK) equivalence and comparable safety of CT-P6 and the 
US-licensed reference trastuzumab. Treatment-emergent 
adverse events were reported in ten (29%) of 35 
volunteers in the CT-P6 group and 11 (31%) of 35 in the 
reference trastuzumab group, and all were mild in 
intensity. CT-P6 has been approved in South Korea for 
use in the same indications as the reference product.
The aim of this study was to establish the equivalence 
of CT-P6 to reference trastuzumab in terms of efficacy 
in patients with HER2-positive, operable, early-stage 
breast cancer treated in the neoadjuvant setting. In light 
of increasing support for use of pCR as an endpoint 
rather than the proportion of patients with an overall 
response in neoadjuvant studies of early-stage breast 
cancer,7,18–21 including encouragement by the US Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) to use pCR as an 
endpoint for accelerated approval in the neoadjuvant 
setting,22 we chose to assess equivalence using pCR. We 
also compared PKs, pharmacodynamics (PDs), and 
safety data for both treatments throughout the study, 
which included additional adjuvant and follow-up 
periods. We only report data from the neoadjuvant 
period here.
Methods
Study design and participants
In this randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, 
phase 3 equivalence trial, we recruited patients from 
112 centres in 23 countries (appendix). Eligible patients 
were women aged at least 18 years with histologically 
confirmed and newly diagnosed clinical stage I–IIIa (as 
classified according to the American Joint Committee on 
Cancer Breast Cancer Staging seventh edition), operable, 
HER2-positive 
breast 
adenocarcinoma. 
Inclusion 
criteria were an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status score of 0 or 1; normal left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF; ≥55%); adequate bone marrow, 
hepatic, and renal function; at least one measureable 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed using the search terms “trastuzumab”, 
“neoadjuvant”, and “HER2-positive breast cancer” for articles 
published between Jan 1, 2000, and Feb 7, 2017, not restricted 
to the English language. We identified 368 articles, of which 
87 (24%) were clinical trials. These trials show the efficacy of 
trastuzumab for treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer. 
However, a search for “trastuzumab” and “cost” yielded a 
further 47 articles, revealing the debate around the financial 
costs of trastuzumab and the ensuing consequences for global 
access to the drug. 
Added value of this study
We did a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, phase 3 
trial to establish the equivalence of CT-P6 to reference 
trastuzumab in terms of efficacy in patients with HER2-positive, 
operable, early-stage breast cancer treated in the neoadjuvant 
setting. Whereas previous studies of trastuzumab biosimilars 
have used the proportion of patients with an overall response as 
a primary endpoint, we used pathological complete 
response (pCR), which is generally considered to be a better 
endpoint for equivalence studies than overall response. 
A similar proportion of patients in the per-protocol population 
achieved a pCR with CT-P6 and reference trastuzumab, with the 
95% CI of the estimated treatment difference falling entirely 
within the equivalence margin of –0·15 to 0·15. CT-P6 was also 
similar to reference trastuzumab in terms of overall response, 
other pCR-related endpoints, pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic endpoints, and safety profile. Furthermore, 
to our knowledge, this study is the first to show equivalent 
efficacy of a proposed trastuzumab biosimilar and its reference 
product in early-stage operable breast cancer as opposed to 
metastatic breast cancer.
Implications of all the available evidence
This study has shown equivalence of biosimilar CT-P6 to 
reference trastuzumab in terms of efficacy and similarity in 
terms of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and 
immunogenicity. The availability of biosimilar trastuzumab 
has the potential to increase global access to this key therapy 
for patients with HER2-positive, operable, early-stage 
breast cancer.

lesion; and known oestrogen and progesterone status. 
Exclusion criteria included having bilateral breast cancer, 
previous breast cancer treatment, previous anthracycline 
treatment, and pregnancy or lactation. Full inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, and details of amendments, are 
presented in the appendix. Tumour HER2 overexpression 
and hormone receptor status were assessed locally, 
following American Society of Clinical Oncology and 
College of American Pathologists guidelines,23 at the 
screening visit as part of the eligibility assessment but 
assessed centrally for reporting purposes.
The protocol was reviewed and approved by the relevant 
independent ethics committees for each centre. All 
patients provided written informed consent. We did the 
study in line with the Declaration of Helsinki,24 Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines,25 and all applicable regulatory 
requirements. 
Randomisation and masking
After confirmation of eligibility, we randomly assigned 
patients in a 1:1 ratio to CT-P6 or reference trastuzumab. 
We stratified randomisation by clinical stage (stage I or II 
vs IIIa), oestrogen and progesterone receptor status 
(positive vs negative), and country (Europe, the Middle 
East, and Africa vs America vs Asia) and used permuted 
blocks. An interactive web response system was used by 
the funder to assign patients to study groups as per a 
predefined randomisation code. Study participants, 
investigators, and study site personnel remained masked 
to randomisation codes until all final clinical data had 
been entered into the database and the database had 
been locked and released for analysis. pCR was centrally 
assessed by a masked reviewer. Those assessing other 
outcomes were also masked.
Procedures
After a 21 day screening period, patients entered a 
neoadjuvant treatment period (eight cycles of chemo-
therapy over 24 weeks, followed by surgery within 
3–6 weeks of the last dose of study drug), followed by an 
adjuvant treatment period to bring total treatment up to a 
maximum of 1 year. The post-treatment follow-up period 
was 3 years from the date of enrolment of the last patient.
During the neoadjuvant period, we gave CT-P6 
(Celltrion Inc, Incheon, South Korea) or reference 
trastuzumab (herceptin; Genentech, San Francisco, 
CA, USA) via a 90 min intravenous (IV) infusion at a 
loading dose of 8 mg/kg on day 1 of cycle 1 and at 
6 mg/kg on day 1 of cycles 2–8, with dosing occurring 
every 3 weeks for 24 weeks (ie, eight cycles in total). 
Docetaxel (75 mg/m² via a 1 h IV infusion) was 
administered immediately after CT-P6 or reference 
trastuzumab on day 1 of cycles 1–4. On day 1 of 
cycles 5–8, we administered fluorouracil, epirubicin, 
and cyclophosphamide (FEC; 500 mg/m² fluorouracil 
via 3–5 min IV bolus or 30 min IV infusion; 75 mg/m² 
epirubicin via 3–5 min IV bolus or 30 min infusion; 
500 mg/m² cyclophosphamide via 3–5 min IV bolus) 
immediately after CT-P6 or reference trastuzumab. 
CT-P6 and reference trastuzumab were supplied and 
administered via the same procedure.
We allowed dose modification up to a maximum of 
two times (two cycles). We allowed dose delay or 
modification at the investigator’s discretion if a change 
in grade of toxicity occurred, for grade 3–4 non-
haematological toxicity, for asymptomatic cardiac tox-
icity, for an absolute neutrophil count of fewer than 1500 
cells per mm³, for a platelet count of fewer than 100 000/
mm³, or if febrile neutropenia occurred. When a cycle 
had been delayed because of toxicity, we did not reinitiate 
treatment until neutrophil concentrations were at least 
1500 cells per mm³, platelet concentrations were at least 
100 000/mm³, and non-haematological toxicity was 
grade 2 or lower. If we delayed CT-P6 or reference 
trastuzumab treatment, we also delayed chemotherapy, 
with both treatments reinitiated on the same date if the 
dosing delay was 7 days or shorter, using the usual dose 
of CT-P6 or reference trastuzumab (6 mg/kg). If the 
dosing delay was longer than 7 days, chemotherapy and 
CT-P6 or reference trastuzumab administrations could 
be uncoupled and given on different days as clinically 
indicated, but were brought back to a common 
administration schedule as soon as possible. If the delay 
in CT-P6 or reference trastuzumab treatment was longer 
than 7 days, we gave a reloading dose (8 mg/kg over 
90 min) followed by maintenance doses of 6 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks from that point. We permitted dose 
reduction for the chemotherapy agents, but not for 
CT-P6 or reference trastuzumab. 
We collected blood samples for PK analysis before and 
after each infusion of CT-P6 or reference trastuzumab 
and analysed them using a Gyrolab system (Gyros, 
Uppsala, Sweden). We collected blood samples for 
pharmacodynamic analysis before dosing at cycles 1 
and 5 and at the end of treatment for cycle 8. We collected 
blood samples for immunogenicity studies at screening, 
at cycle 4, and at the end of treatment for cycle 8. To 
assess treatment response in the neoadjuvant period, we 
assessed tumours at baseline, after cycle 4, and at the end 
of treatment. After eight cycles of neoadjuvant treatment, 
we did surgery, including axillary lymph node assessment 
(sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node 
dissection), within 3–6 weeks of the last dose of CT-P6 or 
reference trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant period. After 
surgery, patients entered a recovery period of 3–6 weeks. 
We then readministered CT-P6 or reference trastuzumab 
in the adjuvant period.
Cardiac function, including LVEF, left ventricular end-
systolic diameter, and left ventricular end-diastolic 
diameter, were assessed locally with echocardiograms or 
multiple-gated acquisition scans at baseline, after cycle 4, 
and at the end of treatment. We used the results of local 
assessment to guide clinical decision making, but we 
also sent echocardiograms and multiple-gated acquisition

images to independent reviewers for the purpose of 
safety monitoring. Adverse events could be reported at 
any time during the study after patient consent and up to 
30 days from the last dose of study drug. We assessed 
adverse events with the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
version 4.03.
During the adjuvant period, we administered CT-P6 or 
reference trastuzumab at a dose of 6 mg/kg in 3 week 
cycles (ten cycles or fewer) to bring total treatment over 
both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant periods, excluding 
surgery, up to a maximum of 1 year. During this period, 
patients could receive hormone therapy or radiotherapy, 
or both. Treatment after the neoadjuvant period was 
determined according to the physician’s clinical 
judgement. We assessed disease status during the 
adjuvant period and 3 year follow-up period (3 years from 
the date of enrolment of the last patient), until disease 
progression or recurrence. After disease progression or 
recurrence, we assessed treatment of recurrence and 
survival until death or study termination. We also 
followed up patients with disease progression during 
neoadjuvant therapy for survival analysis and treatment 
of recurrent disease.
We assessed overall response with mammograms, 
sonograms, physical examination, and CT scans. We 
did chest and abdomen CT and bone scans before 
patients received the study drug to establish disease 
stage and rule out metastases and after cycle 4 and at 
the end of the neoadjuvant period to make a decision 
regarding surgery and assess the response to 
neoadjuvant treatment. We did a bone scan at the end 
of the neoadjuvant period if clinically indicated. We 
used 
mammography, 
sonography, 
and 
clinical 
examination for determination of progressive disease. 
When results from these three methods were not in 
agreement, we used the method that implied the most 
severe 
disease 
for 
establishment 
of 
secondary 
endpoints. When a bone scan was not available at 
baseline, a CT image could replace the bone scan 
image. We ordered chest CT scans, bone scans, thyroid 
function tests, or other radiological tests if required 
according 
to 
clinical 
symptoms 
and 
signs 
or 
biochemical alterations. In both groups, trastuzumab 
maximum serum concentration (Cmax) and trough 
serum concentration (Ctrough) were established via 
sample analysis in a central laboratory. 
Outcomes
The primary efficacy endpoint was pCR (ypT0/is, ypN0)22 
at the time of definitive surgery, defined as the absence of 
invasive tumour cells in the breast and axillary lymph 
nodes, regardless of ductal carcinoma in situ. pCR 
assessment was completed locally and the histopathology 
reports were assessed centrally by a masked reviewer. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints evaluable at the end of the 
neoadjuvant period included the proportion of patients 
achieving an overall response, defined as partial or 
complete response as assessed by Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1; breast conservation, 
measured as the proportion of patients who had 
lumpectomy; and other pCRs (breast pCR [ypT0/is] and 
pCR without ductal carcinoma in situ [ypT0, ypN0]). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints evaluable at the end of the 
3 year follow-up period are disease-free, progression-free, 
and overall survival, which will be reported elsewhere. 
PK endpoints were the maximum serum trastuzumab 
Cmax 15 min after IV infusion for each dose and Ctrough 
observed before the next dose for cycles 1–7 and at the 
end of treatment at cycle 8. The PD endpoint for the 
neoadjuvant period was central laboratory quantification 
of serum HER2 extracellular shed antigen. Biomarker 
data was a further secondary outcome, which will be 
reported elsewhere.
Safety endpoints were the prevalence and severity of 
adverse events, laboratory measures, and cardiotoxicity, 
as assessed by mean change from baseline to endpoint 
assessment in LVEF, and immunogenicity, as assessed 
by antidrug antibody incidence. We defined a significant 
LVEF decrease as a decrease of ten ejection fraction 
points from the baseline value and a decrease of an 
absolute value of less than 50%. If this decrease was 
confirmed by reassessment within 3 weeks, then we 
considered treatment discontinuation. Other safety 
endpoints were vital signs, electrocardiogram, chest 
radiograph, 
hypersensitivity 
monitoring, 
physical 
examination, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status. 
Statistical analysis
We calculated sample size using nQuery Advisor. 
Assuming a dropout rate of 10% and that 50% of 
patients would achieve a pCR, a sample size of 532 in 
the neoadjuvant period was required to provide at least 
80% power to detect equivalence (at a predefined 
15% equivalence margin, with a significance level 
determined by two one-sided tests of α=0·025). We 
defined equivalence as the 95% CIs for the treatment 
difference being fully contained within the interval of 
–0·15 to 0·15. We derived this margin by reviewing 
 
historical pCR proportions of taxane, FEC, and 
trastuzumab combination therapy. Specifically, we did a 
meta-analysis (unpublished) of six studies4,26–30 of FEC 
plus taxane, resulting in an estimated pCR proportion 
of 15·88%. Pooling of results from four key 
experimental studies4,31–33 of trastuzumab, in which 
patients received a regimen of taxane (paclitaxel or 
docetaxel) with trastuzumab followed by FEC plus 
trastuzumab, showed an overall pCR proportion 
of 53·74%. The difference between patient groups who 
did and did not receive a trastuzumab-containing 
regimen was 37·86%. A 15% equivalence margin 
corresponds to preservation of 60% of the efficacy seen 
in these studies.

We defined the intention-to-treat (ITT) population as 
all patients randomly allocated to study drug, regardless 
of whether or not a dose of study drug was received. The 
per-protocol (PP) population comprised all patients in 
the ITT population, except for those who had a major 
protocol deviation (defined as a deviation that might 
affect interpretation of study results; appendix). The PP 
population included patients who withdrew from 
the study because of confirmed progressive disease after 
surgery, but excluded those who withdrew before 
surgery. Final determination of the PP set was carried 
out at a masked data review meeting, held in accordance 
with the International Conference on Harmonisation 
(ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of 
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Harmonised Tripartite 
Guideline E9.25 The primary outcome was assessed in 
the PP population. The safety analysis population 
included all patients who were randomly allocated to 
study drug and received at least one (full or partial) dose. 
We considered patients who did not have samples 
collected for a particular endpoint non-assessable for 
that endpoint.

we calculated a point estimate and 95% CI for the 
difference between groups for the proportion of 
patients achieving pCR using the exact binomial 
approach. We also did an additional assessment of 
equivalence in pCR proportion in terms of the risk 
ratio. For equivalence to be accepted, the 95% CI for 
the risk ratio estimate had to fall within the margin of 
0·74–1·35. We calculated this margin by meta-
analysing two previous studies,4,7 which revealed a pCR 
proportion with trastuzumab of 50%. In accordance 
with FDA and ICH guidelines, we used half of the 
lower bound of the 50% CI for the ratio of pCR between 
regimens with and without trastuzumab for the 
equivalence margin calculation. This lower bound 
was 1·82; back-transformation of half of log(1·82) to 
the original scale yielded the therapeutic equivalence 
margin for the risk ratio used in this study.
We also did sensitivity analyses (done separately for 
the treatment outcome difference and risk ratio) of pCR 
using a logistic regression model, with treatment group 
as a fixed effect and disease stage (stage I or II 
vs stage IIIa), oestrogen receptor status (positive vs 
negative), progesterone receptor status (positive vs 
negative), and geographical region (Europe, the Middle 
East and Africa vs America vs Asia) as covariates. We 
used a logistic regression model for treatment outcome 
difference and a log-binomial sensitivity analysis for risk 
ratio analysis. For the secondary efficacy analysis, we 
analysed overall response and breast conservation using 
descriptive statistics. We analysed other pCR rates 
(secondary efficacy endpoints) in the same way as for the 
primary efficacy endpoint.
The study was monitored by an independent data and 
safety monitoring board, consisting of a PK specialist, 
statistician, chairing physician, and indepen 
dent 
physician. Additionally, an independent tumour review 
committee reviewed pathology reports and safety 
assessments and established the tumour response for 
the purposes of data analysis and reporting. This trial is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02162667

Results
Between Aug 7, 2014, and May 6, 2016, of the 781 patients 
screened, we randomly assigned 549 (70%) to CT-P6 
(271 [49%]) or reference trastuzumab (278 [51%]; ITT 
population; figure). The PP population comprised 
504 patients (248 [49%] in the CT-P6 group vs 256 [51%] 
in the reference trastuzumab group). Major protocol 
deviations that led to exclusion of patients from the PP 
set are detailed in the appendix. The safety analysis 
population comprised all patients in the ITT population 
(271 [49%] vs 278 [51%]). Baseline characteristics were 
similar between the two groups in the ITT population 
(table 1). Baseline characteristics in the PP population 
were similar to those in the ITT population, and were

again similar between groups (appendix). Exposure to 
study drug and chemotherapy agents was also similar 
between groups (appendix).
A similar proportion of patients achieved pCR at the 
time of surgery in the CT-P6 (116 [46·8%; 95% CI 
40·4–53·2] of 248 patients) and reference trastuzumab 
(129 [50·4%; 44·1–56·7] of 256) groups in the PP 
population according to central review (table 2, 3). The 
estimated difference in pCR proportion between the 
two groups was –0·04% (95% CI –0·12 to 0·05), with the 
95% CI entirely within the prespecified equivalence 
margin of ±0·15. The risk ratio estimate for the pCR 
proportion in the PP population was 0·93 (95% CI 
0·78–1·11) and the 95% CI for this estimate fell within the 
prespecified equivalence margin of 0·74 to 1·35. For both 
the difference and risk ratio, analyses of local investigator 
data yielded results identical to those from the central 
review. The sensitivity analysis of the PP population using 
treatment group as fixed effect, and clinical stage, 
oestrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status, 
and geographical region as covariates, was similar to the 
primary analysis, as was the ITT analysis (table 3). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints are summarised for the 
PP set in table 2. pCR proportions in the PP population 
were similar between groups when analysed according to 
clinical stage. A similar proportion of patients in each 
group achieved breast pCR. Results in the ITT population 
were similar to those in the PP population: 133 (49·1%) 
of 271 patients in the CT-P6 group achieved breast pCR 
compared with 145 (52·2%) of 278 in the reference 
trastuzumab group. The treatment outcome difference 
was –0·03% (95% CI –0·11 to –0·05), with the 95% CI 
falling within the prespecified ±0·15 equivalence margin. 
The risk ratio estimate was 0·94 (95% CI 0·80–1·11), 
with the 95% CI also falling within the equivalence 
margin. A similar proportion of patients in the CT-P6 
and reference trastuzumab groups achieved pCR without 
DCIS in the PP population (table 2).
Among patients who were hormone receptor positive in 
the PP population, 59 (40%) of 149 patients showed a pCR 
in the CT-P6 group compared with 61 (41%) of 150 in the 
reference trastuzumab group. Among patients who were 
hormone receptor negative, 57 (58%) of 99 patients 
showed a pCR in the CT-P6 group compared with 
68 (64%) of 106 in the reference trastuzumab group. 
The most common type of surgery in both groups in 
the PP population was mastectomy (168 [68%] of 
248 patients in the CT-P6 group vs 173 [68%] of 256 in the 
reference trastuzumab group). The proportion of patients 
who had breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy) was 
similar between groups in the PP population (table 2). 
Results in the ITT population were similar to those for 
the PP population (mastectomy 174 [64%] of 271 in the 
CT-P6 group vs 176 [63%] of 278 in the reference 
trastuzumab group; lumpectomy 57 [21%] vs 53 [19%]). 
Overall response was similar between groups, based on 
central review in the PP population (table 2). Overall 
response for the ITT population was similar to that for 
the PP population: 230 (84·9% [95% CI 80·0–88·9]) of 
271 patients had an overall response in the CT-P6 group 
compared with 234 (84·2% [79·3–88·3] of 278 in the 
reference trastuzumab group.
No notable differences occurred in PK endpoints 
between groups at any cycle in the neoadjuvant period.

CT-P6 group versus 178·57 µg/mL (31·01%) in the 
reference trastuzumab group. Cmax remained stable and 
similar between the two groups throughout cycles 2–8. 
Cycle 1 mean reference trastuzumab Ctrough values were 
18·92 µg/mL (121·58%) versus 18·91 µg/mL (112·65%), 
remaining stable and similar between the two groups 
throughout cycles 2–8 (appendix).
The mean concentration of HER2 extracellular shed 
antigen decreased from baseline in both groups. At 
baseline, mean concentrations were 12426·8 pg/mL 
(SD 
9176·8) 
in 
the 
CT-P6 
group 
versus 
11925·3 pg/mL (8578·6) in the reference trastuzumab 
group (appendix). After cycle 4, change from baseline was 
–6284·6 
pg/mL 
(SD 
8658·4) 
versus 
–6043·2 
pg/mL 
(8594·0). 
At the end of neoadjuvant  treatment (cycle 8), change from 
baseline was –5569·8 pg/mL (SD 8751·8) versus 
–5290·2 pg/mL (8708·3). Actual antigen concentrations 
were also similar between groups at each timepoint 
measured (appendix).
The proportion of patients reporting at least one 
treatment-emergent adverse event was similar between 
the two groups (table 4). The most frequent treatment-
emergent adverse events in the CT-P6 group were alopecia, 
nausea, 
infusion-related 
reactions, 
and 
diarrhoea, 
whereas in the reference trastuzumab group, they were 
alopecia, neutropenia, and nausea. All treatment-emergent 
adverse events of grade 3 or worse and of grade 1–2 
occurring in at least 10% of patients, and all treatment-
related cardiac events of any grade that were observed 
during the study, are given in the appendix. Grade 3 or 
worse treatment-related adverse events occurred in 17 (6%) 
of 271 patients in the CT-P6 group versus 23 (8%) of 278 in 
the reference trastuzumab group; neutropenia was the 
only frequently reported (>3% of patients) event, occurring 
in ten (4%) versus 14 (5%). A similar proportion of patients 
in each group had treatment-emergent adverse events 
leading to discontinuation (table 4). In the CT-P6 group, 
one death had no causal relationship to the study drug, but 
a potential role of metastases could not be fully ruled out, 
and the other death was due to dyspnoea, with underlying 
causes of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary hypertension, 
and pulmonary embolism, and was considered unrelated 
to the study drug. The single death in the reference 
trastuzumab group, due to acute myocardial infarction, 
was considered possibly related to the study drug. The 
patient had a history of severe hypertension and ischaemic 
heart disease. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events due to heart 
failure were reported in five (2%) of 271 patients in the 
CT-P6 group and three (1%) of 278 in the reference 
trastuzumab group. Of these patients, only one 
individual in the reference trastuzumab group was 
withdrawn from the study (because of a confirmed 
decrease in LVEF). One patient in the CT-P6 group had 
grade 1 heart failure, but no substantial decrease in 
LVEF (6% decrease from baseline; LVEF remained 
above 55%). The investigator confirmed that this patient 
had no signs or symptoms of heart failure. LVEF 
measurements are presented in table 5. Infusion-related 
reactions were reported in 23 (8%) of 271 patients in the 
CT-P6 group versus 25 (9%) of 278 in the reference 
trastuzumab group (table 4), and most were grade 1 or 2 
(22 [96%] of 23 in the CT-P6 group vs 24 [96%] of 25 in 
the 
reference 
trastuzumab 
group). 
No 
notable 
differences occurred between the two groups in other 
safety outcomes (data not shown). All postinfusion 
antidrug antibody tests were negative.

Discussion
The results of this randomised, double-blind, active-
controlled trial substantiate the therapeutic equivalence 
of CT-P6 and reference trastuzumab using two different 
predefined equivalence margins. The trial achieved its 
primary endpoint by showing that an equivalent 
proportion of patients with HER2-positive, operable, 
early-stage breast cancer treated in the neoadjuvant 
setting had a pCR with CT-P6 compared with reference 
trastuzumab. All secondary endpoints assessable at the 
end of the neoadjuvant period were similar between 
groups. CT-P6 was well tolerated, with a similar safety 
profile to that of reference trastuzumab.
Trastuzumab has greatly improved treatment of 
HER2-positive breast cancer. In the GeparQuattro study,6 
32% of patients with operable or locally advanced 
HER2-positive 
breast 
cancer 
achieved 
pCR 
with 
chemotherapy and trastuzumab compared with 16% of 
those with HER2-negative tumours receiving chemo-
therapy alone. In the Taxol Epirubicin Cyclophosphamide 
Herceptin Neoadjuvant trial,8 39% of patients with 
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer achieved pCR with 
trastuzumab and chemotherapy, and pCR was associated 
with improved proportions of 3 year disease-free and 
overall survival compared with patients who did not 
achieve pCR. Similarly, in the Neoadjuvant Herceptin 
trial,7 39% of patients achieved pCR with trastuzumab 
plus chemotherapy compared with 20% of patients 
receiving chemotherapy alone. Event-free survival was 
strongly associated with pCR.34
However, despite the importance of trastuzumab for 
treatment of HER2-positive cancers—including metastatic 
breast and gastric cancers—the cost of the drug creates 
barriers to access. A course of trastuzumab can cost up 
to US$70 000.35 Almost half of oncologists in one survey36 
reported that they would increase use of trastuzumab if a 
biosimilar product was available. Total cost savings in 
individual countries from adoption of CT-P6 will depend 
on many factors, including market penetration and price; 
a budget effect model in Croatia has predicted 1 year cost 
savings of up to €0·69 million from introduction of 
biosimilar trastuzumab.37 The Congressional Budget 
Office previously estimated that biosimilars could reduce 
total expenditure on biologicals in the USA by 
approximately $25 billion over a decade.38 A study in 
Europe found that the average discount for biosimilars 
versus reference products was approximately 15% 
(ranging from 0–32%), but was country and product 
dependent.14
Various potential biosimilars to reference trastuzumab 
are in development. PF-05280014 (Pfizer, New York, NY, 
USA) has shown similar PK39 and non-clinical40 
characteristics to the US-licensed and EU-licensed 
reference trastuzumab. In metastatic breast cancer, a 
phase 3 trial41 has shown non-inferiority of BCD-022 
(BIOCAD, St Petersburg, Russia) to reference trastuzumab 
in terms of overall response. Additionally, Rugo and 
colleagues42 showed equivalent efficacy and similar safety 
profiles of Hertaz (Biocon [Bangalore, India]/Mylan 
[Canonsburg, PA, USA]) and trastuzumab in the only 
other full report of a phase 3 study to date. Physicians 
might consider pCR proportion to be a more credible 
endpoint than overall response for equivalence studies.21 
This preference is because increasing evidence, including 
results of a pooled analysis of almost 12 000 patients 
treated in the neoadjuvant setting,20 indicates that pCR is 
associated with overall survival.7,18,19 The FDA encourages 
use of pCR22 as an endpoint to support accelerated 
approval of agents for neoadjuvant treatment of high-risk, 
early-stage breast cancer because it can be evaluated after 
short periods of treatment.
We determined the equivalence margin used in this 
study by meta-analysis (unpublished) of pCR proportions 
arising from taxane, FEC, and trastuzumab combination 
therapy from nine published studies. This analysis, 
together with consideration of the precision range and 
European regulatory precedents, led to a proposed 
margin of 15%, which we considered appropriate and 
provided adequate assay sensitivity. Furthermore, the 
margin was in line with those used in trials42,43 of other 
trastuzumab biosimilars.
This study showed therapeutic equivalence of biosimilar 
CT-P6 to reference trastuzumab in patients with early-
stage, operable, HER2-positive breast cancer, whereas 
other studies, including two phase 3 trials of other 
proposed trastuzumab biosimilars,20,21 have focused on 
metastatic disease.41,42 Patients with early-stage, operable 
disease might be a more suitable population for equiv-
alence studies than might those with metastatic disease.44

This advantage is because those with early-stage, operable 
disease tend to be a more homogeneous population with 
similar disease history and have lower disease burden and 
risk of secondary tumours or serious adverse events than 
patients with metastatic disease. A further strength of this 
study is that the dosing regimens in the neoadjuvant and 
adjuvant settings were the same as those approved for 
reference trastuzumab in Europe and the USA. 
Additionally, although the chemotherapy backbone in 
neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based regimens varies across 
trials, sequential use of a taxane and an anthracycline-
containing regimen, as used in this study, is considered 
standard of care in this setting.10 In many countries, 
trastuzumab and taxane are now used in combination 
with the HER2 receptor antagonist pertuzumab, as this 
dual anti-HER2 therapeutic approach has been shown to 
further improve pCR.45
A potential limitation of this study is that, in clinical 
practice, docetaxel can be administered at doses of up to 
100 mg/m² in the neoadjuvant setting.10 We did, 
however, select the dosing regimen of docetaxel used in 
this study (75 mg/m² every 3 weeks) on the basis of 
literature evidence. Various studies46,47 have reported 
neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer 
with trastuzumab in combination with this regimen 
(with or without FEC) to be efficacious. Additionally, 
some studies suggest that increasing the dose of 
docetaxel can affect safety and efficacy. A key study by 
Harvey and colleagues48 in 2006 examined the effects of 
increasing docetaxel dose in patients with breast cancer 
and found a dose-response relationship with respect to 
efficacy and toxicity. The proportion of assessable 
patients with a tumour response receiving 60 mg/m² 
docetaxel every 3 weeks was 22%, receiving 75 mg/m² 
was 23%, and receiving 100 mg/m² was 36%, with a 
significant dose-response relationship in the assessable 
(p=0·007) and ITT (p=0·026) populations. Incidences of 
most haematological and non-haematological toxicities 
were also related to increasing dose, with grade 3–4 
neutropenia occurring in 76% of patients receiving 
60 mg/m², 84% of those receiving 75 mg/m², and 
93% of those receiving 100 mg/m², and with febrile 
neutropenia occurring in 5% of those receiving 
60 mg/m², 7% of those receiving 75 mg/m², and 14% of 
those receiving 100 mg/m². The authors concluded that 
although all three doses of docetaxel were active and 
regarded to show manageable toxicity, dose selection 
should be made on the basis of treatment goals and 
patient characteristics.48 In our study, we considered 
75 mg/m² docetaxel every 3 weeks, which had moderate 
efficacy and toxicity in the study by Harvey and 
colleagues,48 to be the most appropriate dose. We also 
considered this regimen to be preferable to a weekly 
dosing regimen. We also selected the dose of epirubicin 
used in this study on the basis of literature evidence. 
Phase 3 randomised controlled trials5,49 in patients with 
HER2-positive breast cancer have shown the efficacy of 
this dose in the neoadjuvant setting, including in 
combination with trastuzumab. Additionally, the role of 
fluorouracil in the presence of epirubicin and cyclo-
phosphamide has been the subject of some debate. 
However, as the chemo 
therapy regimen used was the 
same across both treatment groups, we do not believe 
these factors to have influenced between-group pCR 
comparisons.
We did the primary analysis in the PP rather than the 
ITT population as recommended by ICH E925 and FDA50 
guidelines for non-inferiority trials. By contrast with a 
superiority trial for which the ITT population is preferred, 
analysis of the results of an equivalence trial in the ITT 
population—which includes patients who withdraw, 
drop out, or show non-adherence—can bias the results 
in favour of equivalence and undermine the validity of 
the trial. We did, however, repeat the analysis in the ITT 
population and obtained similar results.
After completion of the neoadjuvant period, patients 
received up to ten further cycles of single-agent CT-P6 
or reference trastuzumab in the adjuvant period to 
bring total treatment up to a maximum of 1 year from 
the first day of receiving neoadjuvant study drug to the 
end of the adjuvant period. They then entered a post-
treatment follow-up period, which will continue for up 
to 3 years after the date of enrolment of the last patient. 
Disease-free, progression-free, and overall survival 
efficacy endpoints will be evaluated to assess the long-
term equivalence of CT-P6 to reference trastuzumab. As 
pCR is only a surrogate for disease-free and overall 
survival, long-term follow-up of this study will be 
important to assess these outcomes, although the trial is 
not powered for survival. Additional long-term data 
collection and follow-up analysis is under consideration 
by the funder.
