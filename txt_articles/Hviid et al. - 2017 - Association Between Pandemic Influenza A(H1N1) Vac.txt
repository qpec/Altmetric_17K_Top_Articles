Association Between Pandemic Influenza A(H1N1) Vaccination
in Pregnancy and Early Childhood Morbidity in Offspring
Anders Hviid, DrMedSci; Henrik Svanström, PhD; Ditte Mølgaard-Nielsen, MSc; Philipp Lambach, MD
IMPORTANCE Several studies investigating potential adverse effects of the pandemic A(H1N1)
vaccine have supported that influenza A(H1N1) vaccination does not increase the risk for
major pregnancy and birth adverse outcomes, but little is known about possible adverse
effects in offspring of A(H1N1)-vaccinated mothers beyond the perinatal period and into early
childhood.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether pandemic influenza A(H1N1) vaccination in pregnancy
increases the risk for early childhood morbidity in offspring.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Register-based cohort study comprising all live-born
singleton children in Denmark from pregnancies overlapping the A(H1N1) influenza
vaccination campaign in Denmark, from November 2, 2009, to March 31, 2010. From a cohort
of 61 359 pregnancies, offspring exposed and unexposed to the influenza A(H1N1) vaccine
during pregnancy were matched 1:4 on propensity scores.
EXPOSURE Vaccination in pregnancy with a monovalent inactivated AS03-adjuvanted split
virion influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine (Pandemrix; GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Rate ratios of hospitalization in early childhood until 5 years
of age. Hospitalization was defined as (1) first inpatient hospital admission, (2) all inpatient
hospital admissions, and (3) first hospital contact for selected diseases, which included
individual infectious diseases and individual neurologic, autoimmune, and behavioral
conditions.
RESULTS The mean (SD) age at end of follow-up was 4.6 (0.40) years for the 61 359 children
included in the study. In the cohort, the mothers of 55 048 children were unvaccinated, 349
mothers were vaccinated in the first trimester, and 5962 mothers were vaccinated in the
second or third trimesters. Children exposed in the first trimester were not more likely to be
hospitalized in early childhood than unexposed children (hospitalization rates per 1000
person-years, 300.6 for exposed vs 257.5 for unexposed; rate ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.94-1.45).
Similarly, children exposed in the second or third trimester were not more likely to be
hospitalized in early childhood than unexposed children (hospitalization rates per 1000
person-years, 203.6 for exposed vs 219.3 for unexposed; rate ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-0.99).
This 7% decreased risk was primarily a result of reduced risks for infectious disease–related
hospitalizations.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study to
date of potential adverse effects manifesting after the perinatal period. We detected no
increased risk for early childhood morbidity. These results support the safety profile of the
influenza A(H1N1) vaccine used in pregnancy.

P
regnant women are prone to a number of physiologi-
cal changes that put them at increased risk for severe
disease and death from influenza.1 The presence of co-
morbid conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and obesity, can
exacerbate this risk.2
In particular, during 20th-century pandemics, dispropor-
tionate rates of severe influenza infection among pregnant
women have been observed in numerous studies.3-5 More re-
cently, during the 2009 pandemic, case reports of increased
morbidityandmortalityinotherwisehealthypregnantwomen
indicated that pregnant women infected with influenza
A(H1N1)wereatsubstantiallyhigherriskforhospitalizationand
intensive care unit admissions with a disproportionately se-
vereclinicalcourse.2,6-9Duringthe2009-2010vaccinationsea-
son, influenza vaccination with inactivated monovalent vac-
cines was recommended to all pregnant women and increased
vaccination rates were observed in a number of countries.10,11
Influenza vaccines can provide moderate protection
againstinfluenzainfectioninhealthyadults,dependingonhow
well the vaccine composition matches the circulating
strains.12,13 In pregnant women, an additional protective ef-
fect can be achieved for their infants.14,15
As with any health care intervention, especially when pre-
ventive and given to the vulnerable population of pregnant
women, maternal influenza vaccination needs a solid evi-
dence base regarding its safety. Several studies investigating
potentialadverseeffectsofthepandemicA(H1N1)vaccinehave
supported that influenza A(H1N1) vaccination does not in-
crease the risk for major pregnancy and birth adverse out-
comes, such as birth defects, fetal death, intrauterine growth
restriction, and preterm delivery.16-18
However, there is a dearth of studies looking at adverse ef-
fects in the offspring of A(H1N1)-vaccinated mothers beyond
the perinatal period and into early childhood. To provide fur-
ther insights into potential adverse effects manifesting out-
side of the perinatal period, we conducted a study of long-
term adverse events following pandemic influenza A(H1N1)
vaccination in pregnancy in the general Danish population in-
cluding 6308 vaccinated pregnant women.
Methods
Cohort
The study included live-born children from pregnancies that
overlapped the A(H1N1) influenza vaccination campaign in
Denmark, which was defined as November 2, 2009, to March
31, 2010. We defined the study cohort using the Danish Medi-
cal Birth Registry.19 This register holds information on all de-
liveries by women living in Denmark. The recorded informa-
tion on each birth includes date of delivery, gestational age,
and a range of other information about the newborn and the
course of pregnancy and delivery. Also included is a range of
informationaboutthemother(eg,parity,bodymassindex,and
smoking status). Gestational age in the Medical Birth Regis-
try is defined on the basis of the first day of the last menstrual
period and is for most women corrected by ultrasonography
in the late first or early second trimester. The onset of preg-
nancy was defined as the first day of the last menstrual pe-
riod and was calculated by subtracting the recorded gesta-
tional age from the date of birth. Information on death,
emigration,anddisappearancefromnationalregisters(eg,emi-
grating without informing authorities) of the children in the
cohort was obtained from the Danish Civil Registration
System.20
This study was approved by the Danish Data Protection
Agency; informed consent is not required for register-based
research in Denmark.
We restricted the cohort to include singleton children born
to women who were 18 to 44 years of age at pregnancy onset.
Among mothers who had more than 1 pregnancy overlapping
the study period, only the first was included. We also ex-
cluded births with a gestational age of less than 32 weeks (be-
cause preterm birth shortens the period of vaccination dur-
ing pregnancy); births among women who had lived less than
5 years in Denmark (to ensure adequate capture of covariate
information for the mothers); births among women who had
been vaccinated before pregnancy onset; and children with di-
agnoses of chromosomal aberrations, genetic disorders, birth
defect syndromes with known causes, and congenital viral in-
fections possibly associated with birth defects (rubella, cyto-
megalovirus, herpes simplex, hepatitis, other viral infections
including varicella, and unspecified congenital viral disease).
Vaccinations
Information on vaccination status and date of vaccination for
the mothers was obtained from the national A(H1N1) vaccina-
tion database, established at Statens Serum Institute.21 In Den-
mark, the only vaccine used was the monovalent inactivated
AS03-adjuvanted split virion influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vac-
cine (Pandemrix; GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals). During the
campaign,clinicsadministeringtheA(H1N1)vaccinewereman-
dated by law to report all vaccinations to the Danish Board of
Health. Furthermore, reimbursement from the Danish Health
Insurance was made only after information on dates and de-
tails had been reported. Information on vaccinations may
therefore be considered close to complete.
The A(H1N1) vaccination campaign in Denmark targeted
individuals with chronic diseases, key government officials,
public-safety workers, and pregnant women.22 Pregnant
women with chronic disease were recommended to get vac-
cinated during their first trimester. Pregnant women without
chronic disease could get vaccinated after individual assess-
ment by a physician.
Key Points
Question Is pandemic influenza A(H1N1) vaccination in pregnancy
associated with an increased risk for early childhood morbidity in
offspring?
Findings In this cohort study, children exposed to maternal
vaccination during pregnancy were not significantly more likely to
be hospitalized in early childhood than unexposed children.
Meaning These results support the safety profile of influenza
A(H1N1) vaccine used in pregnancy.

Propensity Score Models
We estimated 2 separate propensity score models23 for mater-
nal A(H1N1) vaccination in the first and second to third trimes-
ter.Thefirstmodelincludedchildrenwhosemotherswerevac-
cinated in the first trimester and children whose mothers were
not vaccinated during pregnancy. Correspondingly, the sec-
ond model included children whose mothers were vacci-
nated in the second or third trimester and children whose
mothers were not vaccinated. Both models included the same
predictors. All variables included in the propensity score mod-
els are listed in Table 1. After propensity score estimation, we
created 2 distinct propensity score–matched cohorts for ma-
ternalvaccinationinthefirstandsecondtothirdtrimester.The
propensity score matching was conducted using the nearest
neighbor–matching algorithm (caliper width of 0.05 of the SD
of the logit score) on a ratio of 1:4. Standardized mean differ-
ences were calculated to assess balance. Covariates with dif-
ferences less than 10% were considered well balanced.
Outcomes
All outcomes were based on information from the Danish Na-
tional Patient Register.24 This nationwide register holds infor-
mation on all hospital contacts in Denmark, including date of
admission and discharge, setting of care (in terms of outpa-
tient, inpatient, and emergency department services), and di-
agnoses (classified according to International Statistical Clas-
sification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth
Revision codes).
For the analyses of first hospitalization and all hospital-
izations (the primary study outcomes), the outcomes were
based on any inpatient hospital admission after start of follow-
up. In the analysis of all hospitalizations, the number of hos-
pitalizations was based on a definition in which a new admis-
sion was required to be preceded by at least 1 day outside
hospital since the date of previous hospital discharge. For the
analyses of individual infectious diseases and individual neu-
rologic, autoimmune, and behavioral conditions, the out-
comes were based on primary and secondary diagnoses codes
identifiedfrominpatientandoutpatienthospitalcontacts.Spe-
cific International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Re-
lated Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes for the included
individual conditions are presented in the eTable 1 in the
Supplement.
The children in the cohort were followed up from the date
of hospital discharge after birth. For the analyses of first hos-
pitalization, follow-up was censored at the date of the first hos-
pital admission. For the analyses of individual conditions, fol-
low-up was censored at the date of an event of the individual
outcome under study. Other censoring criteria for all analy-
sesweredeath,emigration,ordisappearance;becoming5years
of age; and end of follow-up (December 31, 2014).
Statistical Analysis
The analysis of first hospitalization was conducted using pro-
portional hazards regression yielding hazard ratios (HRs). The
analyses of individual conditions and all hospitalizations were
conductedusingPoissonregressionyieldingrateratios(RRs).25
Forthelatteranalysis,generalizedestimatingequations26were
used to take into account the possibility of nonindependence
between consecutive hospital admissions in the same child.
For covariates with missing values, we treated missing val-
ues as a separate category except for variables with very few
missing values (<1.0%) where we used mode imputation. The
proportion of missing was less than 5% for all 5 covariates that
had missing values (Table 1). We considered effect estimates
to be statistically significant if the 95% CI did not overlap 1.
Analyses were performed with SAS software version 9.4 (SAS
Institute).
Results
We identified a total of 69 598 children from pregnancies that
overlapped the A(H1N1) vaccination period; 61 359 children
were available for study inclusion: 55 048 with unvaccinated
mothers, 349 with mothers who were vaccinated in the first
trimester, and 5962 with mothers who were vaccinated in the
second or third trimester (Figure 1).
First Trimester Cohort
The baseline characteristics of mothers vaccinated in the first
trimester before propensity score matching are shown in
Table 1. Compared with mothers who were unvaccinated,
mothers vaccinated in the first trimester were more likely to
be in the age group of 35 to 44 years of age; were more likely
tobeoverweightorobeseandlesslikelytobeofnormalweight;
weremorelikelytohavehadadiagnosisofcardiovascular,neu-
rological,andrheumaticdisease,aswellasinflammatorybowel
disease and disorders of the genital tract; were more likely to
have been hospitalized for more than 5 days in the year prior
to pregnancy; had more outpatient hospital contacts; and had
moreprescriptiondruguse,bothintermsoftreatmentsforspe-
cific conditions and the number of different drugs used.
The matched cohort included 347 children to vaccinated
mothersand1383childrentounvaccinatedmothers.Afterpro-
pensity score matching, unvaccinated and vaccinated moth-
ers were similar on all measured characteristics; the baseline
characteristics of the matched cohort are shown in Table 1.
Standardized mean differences are shown in eTable 2 in the
Supplement; all covariates were well balanced.
The results from the analyses of first hospitalization are
shown in Figure 2A. A total of 858 children were hospitalized
during follow-up: 675 children to unvaccinated mothers (rate
of hospitalization per 1000 person-years, 171.6) and 183 chil-
dren to mothers vaccinated in the first trimester (rate of hos-
pitalization, 199.3). The risk for first hospitalization was not
significantly higher among children to mothers vaccinated in
the first trimester compared with children of unvaccinated
mothers at 5 years’follow-up (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.96-1.32). The
estimates were similar at 1 and 3 years’follow-up.
Table 2 shows the results from the analysis of all hospi-
talizations. Maternal first trimester vaccination was not asso-
ciated with an increased number of hospitalizations at 5 years’
follow-up (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.94-1.45). Similarly, the number
of hospitalizations was not significantly higher at 1 or 3 years’
follow-up.

The analyses of individual infectious diseases and neuro-
logicalandbehavioralconditionsarepresentedinFigure3.First
trimester maternal vaccination was not associated with a sig-
nificantly increased risk for 22 of the 23 individual outcomes;
the risk for other infections was increased (RR, 1.71; 95% CI,
1.08-2.73). Taking multiple comparisons into account using
Bonferroni-corrected confidence intervals, there was no sig-
nificantly increased risk (RR, 1.71; 95% CI, 0.83-3.56).
Second or Third Trimester Cohort
Characteristics of mothers vaccinated in the second or third
trimester before matching are shown in Table 1. Vaccinated
mothers were less likely to be 18 to 24 years of age; more likely
to be married; more likely to have a medium or long tertiary
education; more likely to have an income in the top distribu-
tiontertile;lesslikelytobenulliparous;andmorelikelytohave
1 to 2 children.
After matching, the cohort for the analyses of second or
third trimester vaccination included 5961 children to vacci-
nated mothers and 23 603 children to unvaccinated mothers;
the 2 groups were well balanced on all measured prepreg-
nancy maternal characteristics (Table 1 and eTable 2 in the
Supplement).
Figure 2B shows the risk for first hospitalization in the
matched cohort. During follow-up, 13 260 children were
hospitalized: 10 633 children to unvaccinated (rate of

hospitalization, 151.6) and 2627 children to vaccinated moth-
ers (rate of hospitalization, 137.5). Vaccination in the second
or third trimester was not associated with an increased risk for
first hospitalization at 5 years’follow-up (HR, 0.95; 95% CI,
0.91-0.99); risks were similar for second trimester vaccina-
tion (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-0.99) and third trimester vacci-
nation (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92-1.04). Truncating follow-up at
1 year (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89-0.99) and 3 years (HR, 0.95; 95%
CI, 0.90-0.99) yielded similar results: no significantly in-
creased risks.
Results from the analyses of all hospitalizations are shown
in Table 2. Vaccination in the second or third trimester was not
associated with an increased number of hospitalizations at
5 years’follow-up (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-0.99); risks were
similar for second trimester vaccination (RR, 0.92; 95% CI,
0.85-0.99) and third trimester vaccination (RR, 0.94; 95% CI,
0.85-1.03). Truncating follow-up at 1 year (RR, 0.93; 95% CI,
0.87-0.99) and 3 years (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.90-1.01) yielded
similar results: no significantly increased risks.
Figure 3 shows the results from the analyses of indi-
vidual conditions. Vaccination in the second or third trimes-
ter was associated with a significantly increased risk for sep-
sis (RR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.26-3.05) and Sjögren syndrome (RR,
1.59; 95% CI, 1.04-2.44). This was offset by significantly de-
creased risks for upper respiratory infections (RR, 0.92; 95%
CI, 0.85-0.99) and gastrointestinal infections (RR, 0.84; 95%
CI,0.74-0.94).Takingmultiplecomparisonsintoaccountusing
Bonferroni-corrected confidence intervals, there was no sig-
nificantly increased risk for sepsis (RR, 1.96; 95% CI, 0.98-
3.91) and Sjögren syndrome (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.82-3.11) or re-
duced risk for upper respiratory infections (RR, 0.92; 95% CI,
0.81-1.03) and gastrointestinal infections (RR, 0.84; 95% CI,
0.70-1.00).
Discussion
In this comprehensive cohort study of Danish children born
to A(H1N1)-vaccinated mothers, we found no support for an
increased risk for early childhood morbidity following A(H1N1)
vaccination exposure.
Children exposed in the first trimester were more likely to
be hospitalized but not statistically significantly so. How-
ever, we recognize that first trimester vaccination was rare in
our cohort and that lack of statistical power cannot be
discounted as an explanation for this null finding. Residual

confounding is also a possible explanation for the small in-
crease in risk we observed. Although we used propensity score
matching with a wide range of baseline maternal characteris-
tics,itispossiblethatconfoundingbyindicationisstillpresent.
Children exposed in the second or third trimester were not
at an increased risk for hospitalization. These analyses were
well powered statistically and we can exclude even small ex-
cess risks with a high degree of certainty. Instead, we ob-
served statistically significant reductions in hospitalization
risks of 7% for all hospitalizations until 5 years of age and 5%
for the first hospitalization until 5 years of age.
In the analyses of specific diseases in childhood, we ob-
served significantly increased risks for other infections, sep-
sis, and Sjögren syndrome. We have no obvious explanation
for these effects. The risks for sepsis and other infections are
unlikely to reflect increased susceptibility to infections in gen-
eral or bacterial infections in particular because we saw no in-
creased risk for meningitis and significantly reduced risks for
upper respiratory infections and gastrointestinal infections.
However, multiple testing cannot be discounted as an expla-
nation; we analyzed 2 exposure windows and 23 outcomes. In-
deed, taking multiple comparisons into account using the
Bonferronicorrection,nosignificantlyincreasedrisksforother
infections, sepsis, and Sjögren syndrome were observed.
Given that infectious diseases comprise most hospitaliza-
tions in early childhood, this group of outcomes is respon-
sible for the reduced risks observed in all hospitalization
outcomes. Although a reduced risk for both laboratory-
confirmed influenza and influenzalike illness have been ob-
served among infants of vaccinated mothers,27 this effect is
attributable to maternally transferred antibodies and is re-
stricted to early infancy in contrast to the effects observed in
our study, which persisted throughout early childhood and
comprised infectious diseases other than influenzalike

diseases in greater detail would be necessary to confirm and
elucidate the reduced risks observed in our cohort.
Toourknowledge,fewstudieshavebeenpublishedonpos-
sible adverse effects extending into early childhood after
A(H1N1)vaccinationexposureduringfetallife.Ludvigssonand
colleagues28 conducted a Swedish cohort study of maternal
A(H1N1) vaccination and offspring mortality. No increased risk
of stillbirth, early neonatal death (days 0-6 after birth), or early
childhooddeath(7days-4.6years)wasobserved.VanderMaas
and colleagues29 conducted a cross-sectional linkage study in
the Netherlands with extensive questionnaire data on ad-
verse pregnancy outcomes, growth and development of the
offspring, and general practitioner contacts for infectious dis-
eases during the first year of life. All outcomes evaluated, in-
cludinginfection-relatedcontactrates,weresimilarinA(H1N1)-
vaccinated and -unvaccinated pregnancies.
Strengths and Limitations
The main strength of our study was its comprehensive design
with register linkage of individual-level data. Information on
A(H1N1)vaccinationandstudyoutcomeswasobtainedthrough
an independent nationwide database, with mandatory report-
ingimprovingtheaccuracyofinformationandreducingbias.We
used a propensity score–matched design incorporating a large
numberofmaternalcharacteristicstocontrolforpotentialcon-
founding. Our study also had a number of limitations. Vaccina-
tionwasrareinthefirsttrimesterinourcohort,limitingthecon-
clusions that can be drawn from our results. Although, we did
include a wide range of maternal characteristics, we cannot ex-
clude residual confounding, especially in the first trimester co-
hort,wherevaccinationwasofferedtomotherswithchronicdis-
easesandhigh-riskpregnancies.Ourstudyattemptedtodescribe
