Cancer cells often require glutamine for growth, thereby distinguishing them from most
normal cells. Here we show that PIK3CA mutations reprogram glutamine metabolism by
upregulating glutamate pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells,
making them more dependent on glutamine. Compared with isogenic wild-type (WT) cells,
PIK3CA mutant CRCs convert substantially more glutamine to a-ketoglutarate to replenish
the tricarboxylic acid cycle and generate ATP. Mutant p110a upregulates GPT2 gene
expression through an AKT-independent, PDK1–RSK2–ATF4 signalling axis. Moreover,
aminooxyacetate, which inhibits the enzymatic activity of aminotransferases including GPT2,
suppresses xenograft tumour growth of CRCs with PIK3CA mutations, but not with WT
PIK3CA. Together, these data establish oncogenic PIK3CA mutations as a cause of glutamine
dependency in CRCs and suggest that targeting glutamine metabolism may be an effective
approach to treat CRC patients harbouring PIK3CA mutations.

ancer cells are distinguished from most normal cells by
metabolic reprogramming, including phenomena termed
the
Warburg
effect
and
glutamine
dependency1,2.
Normally, glucose is converted to acetyl-CoA, which enters the
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Cancer cells, however, convert
glucose to lactate even in the presence of oxygen (Warburg effect)
and utilize glutamine to replenish the TCA cycle3. To enter the
TCA cycle, glutamine is first deaminated by glutaminases (GLSs)
to glutamate4. Glutamate is then converted to a-ketoglutarate
(a-KG), which is a substrate in the TCA cycle. Three groups
of enzymes can convert glutamate to a-KG: (1) glutamate
pyruvate transaminases (GPTs); (2) glutamate oxaloacetate
transaminases
(GOTs);
and
(3)
glutamate
dehydrogenases
(GLUDs)4.
The
metabolic
products
of
glutamine
are
utilized
both
to
produce
ATP
and
to
synthesize
macromolecules in the promotion of tumour growth4. Although
glutamine is a non-essential amino acid, it has long been
recognized that glutamine is a required supplement for culturing
cancer cells.
Many oncogenes and tumour suppressors impact glutamine
metabolism4. Myc overexpression affects cellular glutamine levels
by inducing the transcription of GLS1 and the glutamine
transporter SLC1A5 (a.k.a. ASCT2)5,6. In contrast, SLC1A5
expression is repressed by the Rb tumour suppressor7, whereas
GLS2 was identified as a transcriptional target of p53 (ref. 8). In
addition, it has been shown that p53 represses the expression of
malic enzymes ME1 and ME2, thereby regulating glutamine-
dependent NADPH production9. A recent study showed that loss
of tumour suppressor von hippel-lindau tumor suppressor (VHL)
renders renal cell carcinomas sensitive to glutamine deprivation
through
hypoxia
induced
factor
(HIF)-induced
metabolic
reprogramming10. Moreover, K-ras upregulates the aminotrans-
ferase GOT1 (ref. 11). Though all of these mechanisms impact the
production or degradation of glutamine or its metabolites, the
mechanisms by which many cancer cells become dependent on
glutamine are still unknown or actively debated.
PIK3CA encodes the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase a (PI3Ka), which plays a key role in regulating
cell proliferation, survival and motility12. PIK3a consists of a
catalytic subunit p110a, and one of several regulatory subunits
(a major one being p85a)13. On growth factor stimulation,
p85 is recruited to phosphorylated receptor protein kinases
and adaptor proteins, thereby activating PI3Ka. Activated
PI3Ka converts phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biophosphate (PIP2)
to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). The second
message
PIP3
then
activates
PDK1
and
AKT
signalling.
PIK3CA is mutated in a wide variety of human cancers
including
B30%
of
colorectal
cancers
(CRCs)14.
Recent
large-scale sequencing of human cancer genomes reveals that
PIK3CA is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human
cancer15.
However,
the
fact
that
PIK3CA
mutations
can
reprogram cancer metabolism, as demonstrated herein, was
previously unknown.
We report that PIK3CA mutations render CRCs more sensitive
to glutamine deprivation by upregulation of GPT2, an enzyme
involved in glutamine metabolism. We further demonstrate
that mutant p110a increases GPT2 gene expression through an
AKT-independent signalling pathway. Moreover, we show that
aminooxyacetate (AOA), a compound that inhibits enzymatic
activity
of
aminotransferases,
suppresses
xenograft
tumour
growth of CRCs with PIK3CA mutations, but not with wild-
type (WT) PIK3CA. These results suggest that reprogramming
glutamine metabolism is crucial for the oncogenic function of
PIK3CA mutations and that targeting glutamine metabolism may
be an effective approach to treating CRC patients harbouring
tumour mutations of this gene.
Results
PIK3CA mutations render CRC cells dependent on glutamine.
Most PIK3CA mutations are clustered in two hotspots, with
H1047R in the kinase domain and E545K in the helical domain
the most common mutations16. We set out to determine whether
PIK3CA mutations reprogram cell metabolism in CRCs. The CRC
cell line HCT116 harbours a heterozygous H1047R mutation,
whereas DLD1 CRC cells have a heterozygous E545K mutation
(Fig. 1a). We exploited isogenic derivatives of these cell lines in
which either the WT or mutant allele of PIK3CA is knocked out
(Fig. 1a)17. The clones in which the mutant allele had been
disrupted (and the WT allele was intact) were called ‘WT’
(Fig. 1a), whereas the clones in which only the WT allele had been
disrupted (and the mutant allele was intact) were called ‘mutant’
(Mut, Fig. 1a)17. As reported previously17, the parental cells and
their derived knockout clones grew at similar rate under normal
conditions in the presence of both glucose and glutamine
(Fig.
1b).
However,
in
medium
without
glutamine,
both
parental cells and the two independently derived PIK3CA
mutant clones died faster than did two independently derived
PIK3CA WT clones (Fig. 1b). This relative sensitivity to
glutamine
deprivation
dependent
on
PIK3CA
status
was
observed in both HCT116 and DLD1 (Fig. 1b). Consistently,
glutamine deprivation induced more apoptotic cells in the mutant
clones than in the WT clones as assayed by percentages of sub-G1
cells and amounts of cleaved PARP (Fig. 1c,d). In contrast,
differential sensitivity to deprivation of glucose was not found
(Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1a). Surprisingly, these cell lines
still grew equally well, although slowly, in the absence of glucose
(Fig. 1b). Because recent studies showed that lung cancer cells can
become independent of glucose by upregulation of mitochondrial
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK2), which generates
phosphoenolpyruvate from glutamine to generate ribose for
nucleic acid synthesis18,19, we set out to determine whether PCK2
was upregulated in the HCT116 and DLD1 cell lines when
deprived of glucose. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1b, PCK2
was indeed upregulated in both cell lines.
To
determine
if
metabolic
reprogramming
by
PIK3CA
mutation was generalizable, we tested glutamine sensitivity in
two CRC cell lines with PIK3CA mutations (RKO (containing a
PIK3CA H1047R mutation) and HT29 (containing a PIK3CA
P449T mutation)) and two CRC cell lines with WT PIK3CA
(SW480 and LOVO). As shown in Fig. 1e, glutamine deprivation
induced significantly more apoptotic cells in the PIK3CA mutant
cell lines than in the WT PIK3CA cell lines.
Since KRAS increases glutamine metabolism in pancreatic
cancers11, we set out to determine if KRAS mutations affects
glutamine dependency in CRC cells. HCT116 and DLD1 cells
have heterozygous oncogenic KRAS mutations. Using isogenic
HCT116 and DLD1 clones, with either WT or mutant KRAS
knockout20, we showed that the cells did not have differential
sensitivity
to
glutamine
dependent
on
KRAS
genotype
(Supplementary Fig. 1c,d). Taken together, the data suggest that
PIK3CA mutations may be responsible for CRC cell dependence
on glutamine for optimal growth.
PIK3CA mutations upregulates GPT2 expression. To determine
whether
PIK3CA
mutations
regulate
enzymes
involved
in
glutamine metabolism, we performed serial analysis of gene
expression (SAGE)21 on the isogenic cell lines described above
(Supplementary Data 1). Interestingly, the expression levels of
mitochondrial GPT2, which converts glutamate to a-KG, were
upregulated in both HCT116 and DLD1 PIK3CA mutant clones
compared with the WT clones. This observation was confirmed
by both reverse transcription–PCR (RT–PCR) and western blot

 analyses of the clones (Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Fig. 2a).
None of the other enzymes primarily involved in glutamine
metabolism, including GLS, GPT1, GOT1, GOT2, GLUD or the
glutamine transporter SLC1A5, exhibited differential protein
levels among the PIK3CA mutant and WT clones (Fig. 2b).
Moreover, both GPT2 RNA and protein levels were higher in the
four different PIK3CA mutant lines (HCT116, DLD1, RKO and
HT29) than in the two PIK3CA WT cell lines (SW480 and
LOVO) (Fig. 2c,d and Supplementary Fig. 2b). In agreement with
the notion that KRAS mutations do not play a role in glutamine
dependency in CRC, none of the enzymes showed differential
expression
levels
in
the
KRAS
WT
and
mutant
clones
(Supplementary Fig. 2c).
We next tested if GPT2 expression is upregulated in CRC
tumour specimens with PIK3CA mutations. We measured GPT2
RNA levels by quantitative RT–PCR (qRT–PCR) in 20 human
CRC patient tumours, which we had previously sequenced the
exomes (10 tumours with PIK3CA mutations and 10 tumours
without mutations in the PIK3CA pathway)22. As shown in
Fig. 2e, expression levels of GPT2 were significantly higher in the
tumours with PIK3CA mutation than in the tumours with WT
PIK3CA. To further extend this observation, we mined the TCGA
data set of CRCs with RNA-seq data. As shown in Supplementary
Fig. 2d, CRCs with PIK3CA mutation express significantly higher
levels of GPT2 than CRCs with WT PIK3CA. Moreover, for those
tumours with matched normal tissues, GPT2 expression is
upregulated in nearly all of them (Supplementary Fig. 2e).
To determine whether the upregulation of GPT2 makes
PIK3CA mutant cells dependent on glutamine, we knocked down
GPT2 in the HCT116 PIK3CA
mutant clone
using two
independent shRNAs (Fig. 2f). Because independently derived
PIK3CA
mutant
and
WT
clones
exhibited
near-identical
phenotypes, we chose one PIK3CA mutant clone (Mut 1) and
one PIK3CA WT clone (WT 1) for in-depth analyses. Compared
with cells with a control shRNA, the GPT2 knockdown cells grew
more slowly under normal growth conditions (Fig. 2g), but they

 were less sensitive to glutamine deprivation as assayed by cell
apoptosis (Fig. 2h). These results were further validated with
GPT2 CRISPR/Cas9 knockouts in HCT116 cells (Supplementary
Fig. 2f–i). Although GPT2 knockout cells grew slower than the
parental cells, they were less sensitive to glutamine deprivation
(Supplementary Fig. 2h,i). Moreover, reconstitution of the
knockout cells by restoration of GPT2 expression made these
cells grow faster and more sensitive to glutamine deprivation
(Supplementary Fig. 2j–l). In contrast, knockdown of GPT2 in the
HCT116 PIK3CA WT clone (WT 1) had no effect on their
sensitivity to glutamine deprivation or proliferation under normal
culture conditions (Supplementary Fig. 2m–o). Importantly,
overexpression of GPT2 in the WT clone made it grow faster
under normal culture conditions, and more sensitive to glutamine
deprivation (Fig. 2i–k and Supplementary Fig. 2p). However,
overexpression of an enzymatic inactive mutant GPT2 in the
WT clone had no impact on either cell proliferation or sensitivity
to glutamine deprivation (Fig. 2i–k). In aggregate, these data
demonstrate that PIK3CA mutations render CRC cells more
sensitive to glutamine withdrawal through upregulation of GPT2.

 AOA inhibits the growth of PIK3CA-mutant CRCs in vivo.
AOA inhibits the enzymatic activity of aminotransferases,
including GPT2 (ref. 23). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 3a,
both HCT116 and DLD1 PIK3CA mutant clones were more
sensitive to AOA treatment than the WT clones in tissue culture.
Moreover, AOA significantly inhibited the growth of HCT116
and DLD1 PIK3CA mutant clones when xenografted into nude
mice (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 3b). In contrast, AOA had
no effect on isogenic PIK3CA WT xenograft tumours (Fig. 3a and
Supplementary Fig. 3b), although those tumours grew more
slowly than their mutant counterparts in the absence of AOA
(Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 3b). Importantly, we further
demonstrated that AOA inhibited growth of PIK3CA mutant
xenograft tumours by targeting GPT2, because tumours estab-
lished from the two GPT2 knockdown cell pools were insensitive
to AOA treatment, although they grew much slower than
HCT116 PIK3CA mutant tumours expressing a control shRNA
(Fig. 3b). AOA treatment consistently reduced amounts of a-KG
and alanine, but increased amounts of glutamate and pyruvate, in
the HCT116 PIK3CA mutant tumours (Supplementary Fig. 3c).
To
test
whether
our
observations
with
the
genetically
engineered cell lines were generalizable, we expanded our
xenograft study to a panel of CRC cell lines. AOA inhibited
xenograft tumour growth of four PIK3CA mutant CRC cell lines
(HCT116 (parental cells), DLD1 (parental cells), RKO and HT29;
Fig. 3c). In contrast, AOA had no effect on xenograft tumour
growth of two WT PIK3CA CRC cell lines (SW480 and LOVO;
Fig. 3d). No weight loss was observed for the mice that were
treated with AOA (Supplementary Fig. 3d), suggesting that the
doses of AOA used in the experiments had minimal toxicity.
ATF4 regulates transcription of GPT2. Given that p110a is not
a transcription factor, a key question raised by these data is
how mutant p110a transduces the signals that activate GPT2
transcription. To address this question, we evaluated ATF4,
as recent studies reported that ATF4 is involved in glutamine
metabolism6,24. Interestingly, ATF4 protein levels mirrored GPT2
protein levels in the PIK3CA mutant and WT clones (Fig. 4a).
This correlation was maintained in xenograft tumours (Fig. 4b).

 Because ATF4 induces expression of pro-apoptotic BH3-only
proteins PUMA and Noxa in neuroblastoma cells6, we also
measured levels of these two proteins in the PIK3CA WT and
mutant clones. However, PUMA and Noxa protein levels were
not correlated with ATF4 levels (Fig. 4a), suggesting that the
regulation of the two pro-apoptotic proteins by ATF4 may be
cell-type specific or controlled by other factors.
As shown in Fig. 4c, overexpression of ATF4 in the HTC116
PIK3CA WT clone increased GPT2 protein levels in a dose-
dependent manner. Conversely, knockdown of ATF4 in the
HCT116 PIK3CA mutant clone by two different siRNAs reduced
both mRNA and protein levels of GPT2 (Fig. 4d). In contrast,
knockdown of ATF4 did not affect the expression of other
enzymes involved in glutamine metabolism, including SLC1A5,
GLS1, GOT1, GOT2 and GLUD1 (Supplementary Fig. 4a).
Similar results were observed in both HCT116 and DLD1
PIK3CA mutant clones (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 4a,b).
Importantly, as in the case with GPT2, knockdown of ATF4
rendered PIK3CA mutant cells less proliferative under normal
culture conditions, but more resistant to glutamine deprivation

 (Fig. 4e,f). Conversely, overexpression of a proteasome-resistant
ATF4 S219A mutant in HCT116 WT cells increased GPT2
protein levels and cell proliferation under normal culture
conditions (Fig. 4g,h), but made them more sensitivity to
glutamine deprivation (Fig. 4i). These results suggest that the
mutant p110a–ATF4–GPT2 axis regulates glutamine metabolism.
To determine whether ATF4 activates GPT2 gene transcription
directly, we cloned 1.5 kb of genomic DNA upstream of the
transcription start site of the GPT2 gene into a luciferase reporter
plasmid. As shown in Fig. 4j, knockdown of ATF4 in the HCT116
PIK3CA mutant clone reduced transcriptional activity of the
GPT2 reporter. Examining the DNA sequence in the 1.5-kb
genomic DNA fragment of GPT2, we found two motifs matching
ATF4
consensus-binding
sites
(Fig.
4k).
Mutating
either
site
individually
or
both
together
significantly
diminished
ATF4-mediated transcriptional activity (Fig. 4l).
Mutant p110a stabilizes the ATF4 protein. We next sought to
determine how ATF4 is differentially regulated in PIK3CA
mutant and WT cells. We first showed that ATF4 mRNA levels
were similar in isogenic PIK3CA mutant and WT cell clones
(Supplementary Fig. 4c). Translation of ATF4 mRNA is known
to be induced by stress through phospho-eIF2a (p-eIF2a)-
dependent translation initiation of upstream open reading frames
(uORF)25. To investigate whether mutant p110a upregulates
ATF4 protein levels through this mechanism, we examined
p-eIF2a levels in the PIK3CA mutant and WT clones. As shown
in Supplementary Fig. 4d, similar levels of p-eIF2a were observed
in the PIK3CA mutant and WT clones under normal culture
conditions. This result was in agreement with the uORF reporter
assays indicating that the uORF initiation activity of ATF4 was
similar
in
the
HCT116
PIK3CA
mutant
and
WT
cells
(Supplementary Fig. 4e). Moreover, polysome profiles of ATF4
mRNA were similar in HCT116 PIK3CA mutant and WT clones
(Supplementary Fig. 4f). We also tested whether mutant p110a
affected ATF4 protein stability by regulating its ubiquitination. As
shown in Fig. 5a,b, the ubiquitination levels of both endogenous
and overexpressed ATF4 were much higher in the HCT116
PIK3CA WT clone than in the mutant cells. Consistent with this
result, treatment of HCT116 and DLD1 PIK3CA WT cells with a
proteasome inhibitor MG132 resulted in increased protein levels
of ATF4 and GPT2 (Supplementary Fig. 4g). MG132 treatment
also increased apoptosis in these cells in the presence or absence
of glutamine (Supplementary Fig. 4h)—presumably because of
effects on other pathways—preventing further investigation of
MG132 treatments.
As expected, exposure to a pan PI3K inhibitor (LY294002), a
p110a-specific inhibitor (BYL-719), a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor
(BEZ235) and a PDK1 inhibitor (GSK2334470), each reduced
ATF4 protein levels (Fig. 5c,d). Surprisingly, neither an AKT
inhibitor (GSK690693) nor an inhibitor (CHIR-99021) of GSK3b
(a known downstream effector of AKT) had any effect on ATF4
protein levels (Fig. 5c). In accord with this, expression of a
constitutively active form of AKT1 (myristoylated AKT1) in the
PIK3CA WT clone did not affect ATF4 or GPT2 proteins levels
(Supplementary Fig. 5a). As a control for these experiments, we
found that myristoylated AKT1 did increase the phosphorylation
level of AKT and FOXO1 (Supplementary Fig. 5a), a well-known
AKT kinase target. Moreover, overexpression of myristoylated
AKT1 did not make HCT116 PIK3CA WT cells more sensitive
to glutamine deprivation (Supplementary Fig. 5b,c). Although
mTOR was activated in PIK3CA mutant cells when deprived of
glutamine (Supplementary Fig. 5d), our data suggest that the
activation of mTOR does not determine glutamine sensitivity in
these cells, because the overexpression of myristoylated AKT1
increased mTOR activity in the PIK3CA WT in the absence of
glutamine (Supplementary Fig. 5a).
Interestingly, ATF4 is reported to be a substrate of RSK2
(ref. 26). Although it is not as well-known an effector of PI3K as
AKT, PDK1 also regulates the RSK2 kinase27. Indeed, both a pan
RSK inhibitor (BI-D1870) and a more selective RSK2 inhibitor
(FMK) reduced ATF4 protein levels in the HCT116 PIK3CA
mutant clone (Fig. 5c). In contrast, the inhibitors of p110a, PDK1
and RSK2 had little or no effect on ATF4 protein level in the
HCT116 PIK3CA WT clone (Supplementary Fig. 4i), suggesting
that the activity of the p110a–PDK1–RSK2–ATF4 pathway is
low in these cells. Together, our data suggest a mutant
p110a-activated PDK1–RSK2 pathway that regulates ATF4
protein levels (Fig. 5e, indicated by the red arrows).
To confirm the results obtained with the inhibitors, we first
overexpressed p110a E545K and H1047R mutant constructs in
the HCT116 PIK3CA WT clone. We found that overexpression of
mutant p110a increased both ATF4 and GPT2 protein levels
(Fig. 5f). We then attempted to assess the generality of these
observations and ascertain whether the lipid kinase activity of
p110a is required for the mutant p110a signalling pathway to
stabilize the ATF4 protein. For this purpose, we knocked in a
D933A mutation that inactivates its lipid kinase activity on top of
the E545K mutant allele into the DLD1 PIK3CA mutant clone
(Supplementary Fig. 5e,f). Figure 5g shows that the protein levels
of both ATF4 and GPT2 were reduced in the double-mutant
clones. As expected, AKT phosphorylation levels were also
reduced in the double-mutant cells (Supplementary Fig. 5g).
Importantly, the kinase inactivation mutation made the DLD1
PIK3CA
E545K
mutant
clone
less
sensitive
to
glutamine
deprivation (Fig. 5h). Moreover, knockdown of either PDK1 or
RSK2 in both HCT116 and DLD1 PIK3CA mutant clones
reduced ATF4 and GPT2 protein levels (Fig. 5i,j).
Phosphorylation of ATF4 by RSK2 protects it from degradation.
RSK2 is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates ATF4 at
the serine 245 residue (S245)26. Knockdown of RSK2 in HCT116
PIK3CA mutant clone reduced levels of pS245 ATF4 (Fig. 6a).
Therefore, we hypothesized that phosphorylation of ATF4 at
S245 by the mutant p110a–PDK1–RSK2 signalling axis stabilizes
ATF4. To test this hypothesis, we first examined ATF4 S245
phosphorylation in the HCT116 PIK3CA WT and mutant clones.
As expected, levels of pS245 ATF4 were higher in the mutant
clone than in the WT clone (Fig. 6b). Second, compared with the
expression of a WT ATF4 construct, the expression of an
unphosphorylatable ATF4 S245A mutant construct in the
HCT116 PIK3CA mutant clone resulted in less ATF4 protein
expression (Fig. 6c). In contrast, the ATF4 S219A mutant that
abolishes the binding of ATF4 to b-TrCP1, an ubiquitin E3 ligase
of ATF4 (ref. 24), generated more protein than the WT ATF4
(Fig. 6c). In agreement with our hypothesis that phosphorylation
of ATF4 at the S245 residue stabilizes it, the ubiquitination
levels of the ATF4 S245A mutant were higher than that of the
WT protein (Fig. 6d). These data led us to postulate that
phosphorylation of ATF4 S245 by RSK2 either reduces its binding
affinity to an ubiquitin E3 ligase or recruits a deubiquitinase,
thereby protecting ATF4 from degradation. To this end, we first
tested the binding of WT and S245A mutant ATF4 to b-TrCP1.
However, both WT and the mutant ATF4 bound to a similar
amount of b-TrCP1 (Supplementary Fig. 6a). We then turned our
attention to deubiquitinases and tested the binding of the WT
ATF4 and S245A mutant to eight ubiquitin specific peptidases
(USPs) (USP1, USP2, USP7, USP8, USP9X, USP10, USP14 and
USP18). Among the USPs tested, only USP8 exhibited differential
binding to WT versus mutant ATF4 (Fig. 6e and Supplementary

 Fig. 6b). In agreement with our hypothesis, the ATF4 S245A
mutant bound to less USP8 than WT ATF4 (Fig. 6e). Knockdown
of USP8 by two independent siRNAs in the HCT116 PIK3CA
mutant clone resulted in reduced ATF4 protein levels (Fig. 6f)
and
increased
ATF4
ubiquitination
(Fig.
6g).
However,
knockdown of USP8 failed to make the PIK3CA mutant cells
less sensitive to glutamine deprivation (Supplementary Fig. 6c),
which might be due to additional roles of USP8 in regulating anti-
apoptotic
protein(s).
Consistently,
knockdown
of
USP8
significantly increased apoptosis of PIK3CA mutant cells even
in the presence of glutamine (Supplementary Fig. 6c).
TCA cycle metabolites are higher in PIK3CA mutant clones. As
shown in Fig. 7a and Supplementary Fig. 7a, both the HCT116
and DLD1 mutant clones consumed more glutamine than their
WT counter parts. Glutamine is converted to a-KG to replenish
the TCA cycle (Fig. 7b). Because GPT2, an enzyme that converts
glutamate to a-KG, is upregulated in PIK3CA mutant CRC cells,
we measured glutamine flux in the paired isogenic lines by tracing
[13C5]-glutamine over time. As shown in Fig. 7c, the flux of
glutamine-derived TCA cycle intermediates including a-KG,
succinate, fumarate and citrate was significant higher in the
HCT116 PIK3CA mutant clone than in the WT clone at least at
the early time points. Similar results were observed with the
isogenic clones derived from DLD1 (Supplementary Fig. 7b).
Although the flux of glutamine-derived glutamate was higher in
DLD1 PIK3CA mutant cells than in the WT cells, the flux of
glutamine-derived glutamate was similar in the HCT116 isogenic
pair (Fig. 7c and Supplementary Fig. 7b). Nevertheless, the ratios
of a-KG/glutamate were higher in the PIK3CA mutant clones
than in the WT counterparts (Supplementary Fig. 7c). Similarly,

 compared with the isogenic PIK3CA WT clones, the pools of
alanine and ratios of alanine/pyruvate were higher in the mutant
counterparts (Fig. 7d and Supplementary Fig. 7d,e). These results
support the premise that upregulation of GPT2 by oncogenic
PIK3CA mutations leads to conversion of more a-KG from
glutamine to replenish the TCA cycle. Consistently, knockdown
of GPT2 in HCT116 PIK3CA mutant cells reduced levels of
a-KG and TCA intermediates (for example, fumarate) that were
derived from glutamine (Supplementary Fig. 7f,g). Conversely,
overexpression of WT GPT2, but not enzymatically inactive
mutant GPT2, increased glutamine-derived a-KG and TCA
intermediates (Supplementary Fig. 7h,i).
A major product of the forward TCA cycle is NADH, which
couples with oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP. We
therefore measured the amounts of ATP and NADH in the
PIK3CA WT and mutant clones. In the presence of glutamine, the
amounts of ATP and NADH were significantly higher in both
the HCT116 and DLD1 mutant clones than in their WT
counterparts (Fig. 7e,f and Supplementary Fig. 7j,k). The ratios
of NADH/NAD were also significantly higher in the mutant
clones than in the WT clones (Supplementary Fig. 7m). Although
not statistically significant, the ATP/ADP ratios trended higher in
the mutant clones (Supplementary Fig. 7l). However, under
glutamine deprivation, the amount of ATP and the ATP/ADP
ratio were significantly lower in the mutant clones than in the
WT clones (Fig. 7e and Supplementary Fig. 7j,l), whereas the
amounts of NADH and the ratios of NADH/NAD were similar in
the mutant and WT clones (Fig. 7f and Supplementary Fig. 7k,m).
a-KG rescues survival of Gln-deprived PIK3CA mutant cells.
The results described above suggested that the generation of a-
KG from glutamine to replenish the TCA cycle was critical to the
survival of the PIK3CA mutant cells. To test this suggestion, we
deprived the HCT116 PIK3CA mutant cell of glutamine and then
supplemented the cells with 4 mM dimethyl-a-KG, a cell
permeable form of a-KG. When deprived of glutamine, o8%
cells survived after 3 days (Fig. 7g). In contrast, the addition of
dimethyl-a-KG increased cell survival to B60%.
Discussion
Our
data
demonstrate
that
oncogenic
PIK3CA
mutations
reprogram glutamine metabolism through the upregulation of
GPT2 in CRCs. Although a previous study by Weinberg and
colleagues suggests that GPT2 is involved in oncogenic KRAS
mutation-mediated glutamine metabolism in HCT116 cells, they
did
not
investigate
how
K-ras regulates
GPT2
(ref.
28).
Importantly, using isogenic cell lines with either mutant allele
or WT allele knockout, we clearly demonstrated that KRAS
mutation does not make HCT116 and DLD1 CRC cells more
dependent on glutamine. Moreover, both SW480 and LOVO
CRC cell lines harbour oncogenic KRAS mutations, but the two
cell lines were resistant to glutamine deprivation. Thus, our data
suggest that mutant KRAS is not a key determinant of glutamine
dependency in CRCs. Consistently, knock-in of mutant K-ras in
mouse and a human cell line actually reduces or does not
affect PI3K/AKT activities29,30, although WT K-ras interacts and
activates PI3K (ref. 31). In contrast, our data provide compelling
evidence that oncogenic PIK3CA mutations in CRCs render them
more sensitive to glutamine deprivation. Given that several
studies
show
that
PI3K/AKT
signalling
regulates
glucose
metabolism32,33, it is surprising to observe that HCT116 and
DLD1 PIK3CA mutant and WT knockout clones could grow
without glucose. Our data could be interpreted that upregulation
of PCK2 in HCT116 and DLD1 cells deprived of glucose
attenuates glucose dependency of these cells.
Our data also show that CRC cells harbouring PIK3CA
mutations, but not those cells with WT PIK3CA, are sensitive to
growth inhibition by AOA, a compound that blocks the
conversion of glutamate to a-KG. These findings constitute a
proof of principle that targeting glutamine metabolism could be a
useful approach to treating CRCs harbouring PIK3CA mutations.
Since the first PIK3CA mutations in human cancers were
discovered14, huge efforts have been made to develop small

Figure 6 | Phosphorylation of ATF4 S245 by RSK2 enhances its binding
to USP8 and protects ATF4 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation.
(a) Knockdown of RSK2 in a HCT116 PIK3CA mutant clone reduces pS245
ATF4 protein levels. HCT116 PIK3CA mutant cells were transfected with
either control siRNA or siRNA against RSK2. Cell lysates were made 48 h
post transfection, immunoprecipitated with anti-ATF4 antibodies and
blotted with antibodies against either pS245 ATF4 or total ATF4. (b) Levels
of pS245 ATF4 are higher in the HCT116 PIK3CA mutant clone than the
WT clone. ATF4 proteins were immunoprecipitated and blotted with an
anti-pS245 ATF4 antibody. (c) The ATF4 S245A mutant is less stable than
the WT protein. The indicated constructs were expressed in the HCT116
PIK3CA mutant clone and cell lysates were blotted with the indicated
antibodies. A Myc-paxillin construct was co-transfected as an internal
control. (d) Ubiquitination levels of ATF4 S245A mutant are higher than
that of WT protein. Constructs expression FLAG-tagged WT or S245A
ATF4 were co-transfected with HA-ubiquitin into HCT116 PIK3CA mutant
cells. Seventy-two hours post transfection, FLAG-tagged ATF4 proteins
were immunoprecipitated and blotted with anti-human influenza
hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies to detect ubiquitin. (e) The ATF4 S245A
mutant binds to less USP8 than the WT protein. The indicated ATF4
constructs were transfected into HCT116 PIK3CA mutant cells. ATF4
immunocomplexes were pulled down by anti-FLAG antibodies and blotted
with an anti-USP8 antibody. (f) Knockdown of USP8 with two different
siRNAs in the HCT116 PIK3CA mutant clone reduces ATF4 protein levels.
(g) Knockdown of USP8 increases the levels of ATF4 ubiquitination. Control
siRNA or siRNA against USP8 was transfected into HCT116 PIK3CA mutant
cells. Seventy-two hours post transfection, cells were treated with 5 mM
MG132 for 6 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ATF4
antibodies and blotted with an anti-ubiquitin antibody.

 molecule inhibitors of p110a (ref. 34). However, because the
catalytic domains of class I lipid kinases, p110a, p110b, p110g
and p110d, are highly conserved, it is difficult to design small
molecules that specifically inhibit the p110a isoform35, and pan-
PI3K inhibitors are highly toxic. Moreover, the p110a inhibitors
developed to date do not discriminate between mutant and WT
p110a proteins. A recent study showed that cancer cells quickly
develop resistance to a p110a-specific inhibitor BYL719 (ref. 36).
Our study suggests that targeting glutamine metabolism may
provide a specific form of therapy for cancer patients harbouring
PIK3CA mutations.
The findings reported here demonstrate that GPT2 is the key
determinant of glutamine sensitivity in PIK3CA mutant CRC
cells. GPT2 is an aminotransaminase that converts glutamate to
a-KG, which is a TCA cycle intermediate. Metabolic profiling
shows that amounts of a-KG are significantly higher in the
PIK3CA mutant clones than in the WT clones and that the other
TCA cycle intermediates are also higher in the mutant clones
than in the WT clones. Moreover, a-KG largely rescues PIK3CA
mutant cells from cell death caused by glutamine deprivation,
suggesting
that
a-KG
is
a
key
metabolite
required
for
PIK3CA mutant cell growth. Together, these data suggest that
upregulation of GPT2 by PIK3CA mutations produces more
a-KG from glutamine to replenish the TCA, thereby generating
more ATP and intermediates for macromolecule synthesis to
sustain rapid growth of PIK3CA mutant tumours. This is in
agreement with our observation that both the ATP concentration
and the ATP/ADP ratios were higher in the PIK3CA mutant cells
than in the WT cells.
AOA potently inhibits xenograft tumour growth of CRCs with
PIK3CA mutations, despite its low potency to inhibit growth of
CRC cells in culture. A similar discrepancy was also observed

 with a breast cancer cell line23. We postulate that tumour cells are
more dependent on glutamine in the in vivo microenvironment
than the in vitro tissue culture conditions. Although AOA is a
pan-aminotransferase inhibitor, our data clearly demonstrate
that the tumour inhibitory effect of AOA on PIK3CA mutant
xenografts
is
indeed
on-target
to
GPT2,
because
GPT2
knockdown cells grow much slower in nude nice and these
tumours are insensitive to AOA treatment. Consistently, AOA
treatment reduces amounts of a-KG and alanine, but increases
amount of pyruvate and glutamate, in PIK3CA mutant xenograft
tumours. Currently, only pan-aminotransferase inhibitors are
available. It is conceivable that a GPT2-specific inhibitor could be
more potent and less toxic. Given that GPTs are also involved in
gluconeogenesis in liver and kidney, GPT inhibitors may cause
hypoglycaemia. However, a study by Lindblom et al. shows that
GPT1, but not GPT2, is predominantly expressed in liver and
kidney37. Thus, GPT2-specific inhibitors could still have a
favourable therapeutic index.
It is generally believed that AKTs are the key mediators of the
oncogenic signalling of PI3Ks (ref. 38). This study, however,
revealed a novel p110a–PDK1–RSK2–ATF4–GPT2 pathway that
regulates glutamine metabolism. We demonstrated that blocking
this pathway inhibits PIK3CA mutant tumour growth in vitro
and in vivo, suggesting that this novel signalling pathway also
plays a critical role in tumorigenesis driven by PIK3CA
mutations. While our previous studies showed that AKT
signalling drives metastasis of PIK3CA mutant tumours39, here
we propose the p110a–PDK1–RSK2–ATF4–GPT2 signaling axis
reprogrammes glutamine metabolism that is required to generate
energy and metabolites to sustain rapid growth in PIK3CA
mutant tumours.
In summary, we have discovered a novel mechanism through
which mutant p110a perturbs the regulation of glutamine and
makes cancer cells more dependent on adequate glutamine levels.
We demonstrated that mutant p110a activates RSK2 kinase
through PDK1. Activated RSK2 then phosphorylates ATF4 at the
serine residue 245, which in turn recruits the deubiquitinase
USP8 and protects ATF4 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation
(Supplementary Fig. 8). This pathway can be targeted by various
means, which may provide potential selective therapies for the
treatment of the large number of patients whose tumours harbour
PIK3CA mutations. Future experiments may extend our study to
a large panel of CRC cell lines, patient-derived xenografts and
transgenic PIK3CA mutant mouse models.
Methods
Cell culture. CRC cell lines HCT116, DLD1, RKO, HT29, SW480 and LOVO were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Isogenic PIK3CA mutant and
WT and KRAS mutant, and WT HCT116 and DLD1 cell lines were generated
previously17,20. All cell lines were maintained in McCoy’s 5A medium (Fisher
Scientific, Catalogue No. SH30200) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Fisher
Scientific, Catalogue No. SH30910). Tissue cultures were routinely assayed for
mycoplasma to ensure that they were mycoplasma-free. For glutamine deprivation,
cells were cultured in glutamine- and pyruvate-free DMEM with 4.5 g l � 1 glucose
(Fisher Scientific, Catalogue No. SH30081) with 10% dialysed FBS (dFBS;
Invitrogen, Catalogue No. 26400). For glucose deprivation, cells were cultured in
glucose-free DMEM (Invitrogen, Catalogue No. A14430) with 10% of dFBS.
Reagents. L-Glutamine, L-glutamine-13C5, D-glucose, dimethyl a-KG and AOA
were purchased from Sigma. Inhibitors LY294002 (pan-PI3K inhibitor), BYL-719
(p110a-specific inhibitor), BEZ235 (PI3K/mTOR dual-specificity inhibitor),
GSK2334470 (PDK1 inhibitor), GSK690693 (AKT inhibitor), CHIR-99021 (GSK3b
inhibitor), rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor), BI-D1870 (pan-RSK inhibitor), FMK
(RSK2 inhibitor) and MG132 (proteasome inhibitor) were purchased from
Selleck Chemicals. siRNAs for ATF4 (SI03019345 and SI04236337) and PDK1
(SI00301140 and SI00301154) were purchased from Qiagen. siRNAs for RSK2
(J-003026-10 and J-003026-12) were purchased from Dharmacon. siRNAs for
USP8 (SR306014A and SR306014B) were purchased from Origene. shRNAs for
GPT2 (TRCN0000035025 and TRCN0000035026) were purchased from Sigma.
Antibodies used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
Plasmid construction. A GPT2 cDNA clone was purchased from Open
Biosystems. The GPT2 ORF was subcloned into the pCMV-3Tag1A vector with
HindIII and SalI. Then the FLAG-GPT2 sequence was PCRed out and subcloned
into pCDNA3.1zeo with KpnI and XbaI. An enzymatically inactive form of GPT2
(K341H) was generated with the Quick-change Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit
(Agilent Technologies). ATF4 and b-TrCP plasmids were obtained from Addgene.
A FLAG-tagged ATF4 expression vector was constructed by subcloning ATF4 ORF
into the pCMV-3Tag1A vector with BamHI and XhoI. ATF4 S219A and S245A
mutations were made with the Quick-change Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit
(Agilent Technologies). Then the pCMV-ATF4 S219A construct was digested with
NotI and XhoI, and the ATF4 S219A fragment was subcloned into pCDNA3.1zeo.
To make the construct expressing sgRNA to knock out GPT2, the CRISPR/Cas9
vector pX330 was digested with BbsI and ligated with annealed oligonucleotides.
All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 2.
Plasmid transfection. Plasmids were transfected into cells with Lipofectamine
3000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For transient
expression, cells were lysed 72 h after transfection. For stable expression
(FLAG-GPT2 expression), cells were selected with 0.1 mg ml � 1 Zeocin
(Invitrogen) for 7 days.
Serial analysis of gene expression. SAGE libraries were generated from 5 mg of
total RNA, with reagents from the NlaIII Digital Gene Expression-Tag Profiling
preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. This protocol results in a SAGE library wherein each tag is
surrounded by adaptors suited for sequencing on the Illumina Genome Analyzer
platform (Illumina). Each library was loaded on one channel of an Illumina
flow cell, and 17 cycles of sequencing were performed. Sequence tags with
Phred-equivalent score 420 for every base were used for analysis.
RT–PCR analysis. RNAs were extracted using RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A unit of 1 mg total RNA was used for
reverse transcription using the Superscript First-Strand kit (Invitrogen) and cDNAs
were used as templates for PCR. Primers are listed in Supplementary Table 2.
Real-time PCR analysis. RNAs from frozen tumours were extracted as described
above. The Taqman assay system was used for qRT–PCR using GPT2 probes
(Hs00370287, Applied Biosystems) with IQ super mix (Catalogue No. 170-8860,
Bio-Rad). Expression levels of GPT2 in each tumour was normalized to that of
b-2-microglobulin. The PIK3CA mutation status of the human CRC specimens is
listed in Supplementary Table 3.
Mining TCGA data. For TCGA colon adenocarcinoma and rectal adenocarcinoma
patients, RNA-seq files in the *rsem.genes.normalized_results format were
downloaded from the TCGA website for all tumours and, where available, matched
normal tissue samples. This file format provides normalized fragments per kilobase
of exon per million reads mapped (FPKM) values, using the RSEM software40, for
each gene. In addition, the somatic mutation.maf files were downloaded from the
same site for each tumour type. For the PIK3CA mutant group, tumours with the
following characteristics were excluded: (1) nonsense mutations that generate stop
codons; (2) unknown mutations that were not confirmed; and (3) possible tumour–
normal mismatches that had multiple mutations in PIK3CA.
Gene targeting. GPT2 knockout clones were generated with CRISPR/Cas 9.
A pX330 plasmid expressing sgRNA that targets exon 4 of GPT2 genomic
sequences was transfected into HCT116 cells, and single clones were selected.
Knockout clones were verified by sequencing and western blot analysis.
The PIK3CA D933A targeting vector was constructed with the USER system,
and targeted cells were generated with rAAV as described previously41,42. Briefly,
vector arms were created by PCR from genomic DNA using HiFi Taq (Invitrogen)
and validated by sequencing before viral production and infection. Stable G418-
resistent clones were then selected for PCR screening as reported42. Targeted clones
were genotyped by RT–PCR and sequencing. Primers for constructing the targeting
vector and screening for knock-in clones are listed in Supplementary Table 3.
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed in RIPA
buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS,
1% Triton-X100, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethyl sulphonyl fluoride
and complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet (Roche); supplemented with
phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM b-glycerophosphate
and 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate)). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at
14,000 r.p.m. for 10 min, and protein concentration in supernatants was deter-
mined by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of total protein were

 used for immunoblotting. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed as described
above. Cleared cell lysates were incubated with antibody for 1 h, and then protein A
and/or protein G for 1 h. Protein A/G beads were washed with lysis buffer three
times, and then boiled with SDS-loading buffer followed by immunoblotting.
Original images of western blots are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9.
Luciferase reporter assays. The 1.5-kb promoter of GPT2 was subcloned into
the pGL3 vector (Promega) to obtain a pGL3-GPT2 promoter-LUC plasmid.
pGL3-GPT2 promoter-LUC was co-transfect with pCMV-ATF4 and an internal
control b-galactosidase expressing pCH110 plasmid (abbreviated as pCH110 b-gal)
or Renilla luciferase expressing pRL (Promega). Forty-eight hours after transfec-
tion, cells were collected for Luciferase assay according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Promega). Luminescence was measured with an EnVision 2103
Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer). b-galactosidase activity was measured with
a b-Gal assay kit (Invitrogen). Relative luciferase activity was expressed as the ratio
of luminescence normalized to the internal control. Two putative ATF4-binding
sites in the GPT2 promoter were predicted by TFseach v1.3. Mutations in the
GPT2 promoter were generated with the Quickchange kit (Agilent Technologies)
and primers in Supplementary Table 3. The uORFATF4 plasmid was a kind gift
from Dr Ron Wek at Indiana University.
Cell proliferation assays. Cells were plated in 96-well plates at 2,000 cells per well,
24-well plates at 1 � 104 cells per well and 6-well plates at 2 � 105 cells per well in
complete DMEM (20 mM glucose, 2 mM glutamine, 10% dFBS; Invitrogen). After
24 h, cells were washed with PBS, and changed to either glutamine-free DMEM
(with 20 mM glucose) or glucose-free DMEM (with 2 mM glutamine) containing
10% dFBS. Cells (including floating cells in medium) were collected and counted by
Trypan-Blue exclusive assay. Cell numbers in 96-well plates were measured by Cell
Counting Kit 8 (Dojindo) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Flow cytometry. Cells were fixed with methanol and then incubated at 37 �C for
30 min in 5% normal goat serum diluted in PBS. Propidium iodide solution was
used to stain cells at 4 �C for 1 h. Cells were analyzed on an Epics XL flow
cytometer. WinMDI2.9 software was used for data analysis. Cell debris and
aggregates were excluded by propidium iodide gating. Percentages of sub-G1, G1,
S and G2/M populations were determined by histograms generated by WinDI2.9.
Gene silencing. Plasmids expressing shRNAs were transfected into cells. Two days
post transfection, cells were selected with 1 mg ml � 1 puromycin for 7 days.
Puromycin-resistant cells were pooled, amplified and analysed. For genes silenced
by siRNAs, siRNAs were transfected into cells with Lipofectamine 3000. Three days
post transfection, cells were collected for further analyses.
Ubiquitination assays. Cells were pretreated with 5 mM of MG132 for 6 h as
previously described43, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies
against either ATF4 or FLAG. Beads were washed three times with washing buffer
(10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 1% NP-40 and 0.2% SDS).
The immunocomplexes were resolved in SDS–PAGE gels for western blot analyses.
Polysome profile analysis. Three tumours (B250 mm3 size) of each genotype
were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, pulverized and then lysed in 1 ml of lysis
buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 250 mM KCl, 2% Triton
X-100, 8.5% sucrose, 100 mg ml � 1 cycloheximide, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 200 U ml � 1
RNase inhibitor (RNaseOUT, Invitrogen), EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche
Applied Science) and 10 mM ribonucleoside vanadyl complex (New England
Biolabs)), kept on ice for 20 min and then passed 15 times through a 23-gauge
needle. Lysates were spun at 14,000 r.p.m. for 15 min, and supernatants were
collected. Approximately 10–15 absorbance units (260 nm) of lysates were layered
over cold 10–50% sucrose gradients in buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4),
5 mM MgCl2 and 250 mM KCl). Gradients were centrifuged at 17,000 r.p.m. in a
Beckman SW28 rotor for 15 h at 4 �C. After centrifugation, 12 fractions (1.2 ml per
fraction) were collected. RNA from each fraction was isolated using TRIzol LS
reagent (Invitrogen), and an equal volume from each fraction was used for cDNA
synthesis. The relative quantities of specific mRNAs were measured by qRT–PCR.
Inhibitor treatments. To assay ATF4 protein stability, HCT116 PIK3CA mutant
or WT cells were cultured in complete McCoy5A medium and treated with vehicle
or inhibitors for 12 h, then lysed for western blot analyses. For ubiquitination assay
by immunoprecipitation, cells were treated with 5 mM MG132 for 6 h before they
were lysed. For long-term treatment with MG132, cells were exposed to 0.2 mM
MG132 for 48 h. Cells were lysed for western blot analysis, or fixed for flow
cytometry.
Xenograft studies. Animal experiments were approved by the Case Western
Reserve University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. As described
in ref. 44, 3 million cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 4- to
6-week-old female athymic nude mice. Mice were randomly assigned into
treatment groups (5 mice per group). When average tumour volume reached about
100 mm3, mice were injected intraperitoneally with vehicle or with 5 mg kg � 1 or
10 mg kg � 1 of AOA every day. Tumour volumes were measured with an electronic
caliper and calculated as length � width2/2. Body weights were measured at the
beginning and at the end of treatment. These experiments were not blinded.
Glutamine consumption. One million cells were plated in complete medium in a
T25 flask. When the cells were B70% confluent, they were washed twice with PBS,
and changed into medium containing 2 mM of [13C5]L-glutamine (CGln0) and
cultured for 24 h. Medium was collected and frozen at � 80 �C. To measure the
glutamine concentration remaining in the medium (CGln_end), 50 ml of medium
was mixed with 50 ml of 2 mM [12C]L-glutamine as internal standard and 500 ml of
pre-chilled ( � 80 �C) methanol was added. The supernatants were dried with
nitrogen gas. TBDMCS (tert-butyldimethylchlorosilane, REGIS Technologies):
acetonitrile (2:1) was used for derivatization of metabolites at 60 �C for 1 h. Samples
were injected into GC-MS (Agilent Technologies) for analysis. Glutamine
concentration in medium was determined by normalization to the internal
standard. Glutamine (Gln) consumption rate ¼ (CGln0 � CGln_end) � medium
volume/cell numbers/incubation time.
Metabolic assays and stable isotope tracing. A million cells were plated in each
T25 flask. When cells reached B70% confluency, they were washed with PBS twice
and changed to medium containing 2 mM of [13C5-]glutamine. Cells were collected
with 1 ml pre-chilled ( � 80 �C) methanol at 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 h. A unit of 5 mM of
heptadecanoic acid, 2.5 mM of [3,3,4,5,5,5-2H6]4-hydroxypentanoate and 2.5 mM of
[2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,7-2H13] heptanoate were added as internal standards.
Metabolites were extracted by homogenization and sonication on ice. Cell debris
was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 r.p.m. for15 min at 4 �C. The supernatant
was dried with nitrogen gas. TBDMCS:acetonitrile (2:1) was used for derivatization
of metabolites at 60 �C for 1 h. Samples (1 ml) were injected into GC-MS (Agilent
Technologies) for metabolite profiling. The direct [13C5-]glutamine metabolites
are 13C5-glutamate (M5 glutamate), 13C5-a-KG (M5 a-KG), 13C4-succinate
(M4 succinate), 13C4-fumarate (M4 fumarate) and 13C4-citrate (M4 citrate). For
metabolite flux analyses, the total pool of each metabolite was considered as 100%.
Metabolite fluxes were presented as percentage of direct glutamine-derived
metabolites in the total pool. For analysis of metabolite levels, the amounts of
labelled glutamate, a-KG and TCA intermediates at 2 h were measured and
normalized to internal standards. Unlabelled pyruvate and alanine were measured
and normalized to D13 heptanoate.
Assays of ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD. The amounts of ATP and the ATP/ADP
ratios were measured with an ADP/ATP ratio assay kit (Abcam) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The amounts of ATP were determined by an ATP
standard curve, and normalized to the protein concentrations. The amounts of
NADH and NADH/NAD ratios were measured with an NAD/NADH colorimetric
kit (BioVision). The NADH concentrations were determined by a NADH standard
curve, and normalized to the protein concentrations.
Statistical analyses. We applied the t-test to compare the means between two
groups, assuming unequal variances. For xenograft growth, analysis of variance was
performed for repeated measurements to test whether there was an overall
difference in the tumour size.
